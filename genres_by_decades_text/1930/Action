And here's a hand, my trusty friend
And here's a hand o' thine
We'll tak' a cup o' kindness now
For auld lang syne
Brothers, Sons of the Desert.
We are all familiar with the business of this special meeting.
This oasis must meet the situation with determination.
Oooh!
Thank you.
I repeat. This oasis must face the situation with determination.
Every man must be accounted for.
Every man must do his part.
There must be no weaklings in our midst.
We must put our very hearts and souls into this great undertaking.
There must be no thought of failure.
We must stand shoulder to shoulder.
We must work, we must sacrifice.
The weak must be helped by the strong.
For gentlemen, this, the oldest lodge in the Great Order of the Sons of the Desert must be represented 100% at our annual convention in Chicago next week.
We will now take the oath.
And remember: once taken, this oath has never been broken by any man, down through the centuries of time, in the history of this fraternal organisation.
If any member is doubtful of his strength to keep this solemn pledge, he will please be seated.
Get up!
- I don't want to...
- Shh!
Place yourself in position to receive the oath.
Do you all swear to be present at our 87th annual convention in Chicago?
I do!
Me, too.
Wholeheartedly unanimous.
We are the Sons of the Desert
Having the time of our lives
Marching along 10,000 strong
Ta ta, my sweetheart and wife,
God bless them
Tramp, tramp, tramp the boys are marching
As a unit melody
The Sons of the Desert are we.
- Why didn't you want to take the oath?
- I was afraid.
Afraid of what?
I was afraid that if I took the oath to go to the convention, maybe my wife wouldn't let me go.
Of course she'll let you go.
Why, she'll have to let you go.
- You took an oath!
- I know. That's what I'm worrying about.
The Exhausted Ruler said that if you took an oath, it would have to be broken for generations of centuries of hundreds of years.
- My wife wouldn't...
- Do you have to ask your wife everything?
If I didn't ask her,
I wouldn't know what she wanted me to do.
- Hm!
- I didn't want...
I never realised that such a deplorable condition existed in your home.
Why don't you pattern your life after mine?
I go places and do things and then tell my wife.
Every man should be the king in his own castle!
Now, buck up. Go in and tell her that you're going to the convention.
Be a man. I'll see you in the morning.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Ollie, dear.
- Yes, sugar?
- Is Stanley with you?
- He just went in the house.
You'd better tell him that Betty went duck-hunting and won't get back until late.
Alrighty.
- Oliver?
- Yes, baby?
Please close the door.
There's an awful draught in here.
What do you want?
How did you get in there?
I was looking for Betty and came in the back way. I thought...
Betty has gone duck-hunting and won't be home until late.
- Oh. Well, good night.
- Good night.
What?
Do you realise that you have locked me out?
Why don't you ring the bell?
She'll let you in.
Don't get nervous. She'll be here in a minute.
Where do you think I live?
What do you think this is? Halloween?
Come in here, you bad boy.
Come on!
- What do you want?
- I've locked myself out.
- Oh, sugar?
- Yes?
Do you mind if Stanley stays with us until Betty comes home?
- He's locked out.
- Oh, alright.
What are you eating?
- An apple.
- Where did you get it?
- In there.
- Why, that's not real fruit! It's imitation!
It's made of wax!
What has he been doing now?
He's been eating that phoney fruit.
Oh, so that'swhere it's been going!
That's the third apple I've missed this week!
- What's new, sugar?
- Oh, nothing much. What's new with you?
- Oh, nothing to speak of.
- Yes, there is.
You didn't tell her about going to the convention.
What convention?
That's right. I'm glad you reminded me.
The Sons of the Desert are giving their annual convention in Chicago next week and Stan and I are going.
- Oh, you are?
- We thought that the trip would do us good.
Besides being good for us in a business way.
You see, we'll meet new friends and... see a lot of new faces and the change of climate will be good for us in a good many ways.
And besides, all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.
Jack who?
I hope you have a nice time, dear.
- Thank you, sugar.
- Ha, Ha!
- What's that for?
- Just this: you are not going.
- What do you mean I'm not going?
- Just that!
You're not going to the convention.
You're going to the mountains with me.
But he can't go to the mountains.
He took an oath.
- The Exhausted Ruler said that...
- Now, listen, dodo! You keep out of this!
Wait a minute, sugar.
There's no use getting excited.
You're making a mountain out of a molehill.
Certainly, life isn't short enough.
- Are you going?
- Huh?
- I said, "Are you going?"
- Yes, sugar... Mrs Hardy.
- Who said so?
- Him.
Oh... Well, you can do as you please, but you're going to the mountains with me!
Now, wait a minute! You listen to this.
I want this understood once and for all!
I'm not going to the convention,
I'm going to the mountains.
That's just what I said: that you're not going to the mountains, that you're going to the... that you're going to the mountains!
- Why don't you compromise?
- What do you mean, "compromise"?
- He means...
- Shut up!
If you think you're gallivanting off with a lot of hoodlums, to any convention whenever you want to...
Not for a minute, you're not!
Here I am, slaving day after day, washing and ironing 'til my fingers bleed.
- Do you appreciate it? Do you?
- Well, you don't...
Oh, shut up! Don't talk back to me!
Just because I'm an unselfish, what does it get me? Working for you and your interests!
I've planned a vacation for you in the mountains, at a nice resort where they play bridge and have lectures on art.
I fight crowds in department stores, dying of the heat, killing myself trying to get a nice mountain outfit together! Why? Why?!
- Why?
- You keep out of this!
I'll tell you why.
So you won't be ashamed of me.
And do you appreciate it? Do you? Ha, ha!
You want to run off to the convention.
Convention! You'll go to the convention over my dead body.
I'll put you in jail first. And you, too!
With the rest of the Sons of the... oh, the Sons of the Desert!
Ooohh!
Oh...
- What do you think?
- Oh, don't pay any attention to her.
She's only clowning. She'll snap out of it.
Ohh!
- Are you going to stand for that?
- You're darned right I won't stand for it.
I'm the boss in this house, and when I say
I'm going to the convention, I'm going...
- Oh, Lottie!
- Hello, Betty. Come on in.
- I didn't have very good luck. Here's a couple.
- Thanks, Betty.
- What's the matter, Lottie? You look worried.
- I just had a run-in with my barnacle.
- Stanley's in there, too.
- Oh...
And furthermore, you're making a big mistake.
What do you mean?
If you're not careful she'll get the upper hand of you, mark my words.
The upper hand of me? Hm, impossible!
Alright, have it your own way.
I may not be king of my castle, but I certainly wouldn't allow my wife to wear any pants.
I'd like to see my old woman throwing things around.
It's disgraceful.
I never heard of such goings-off... on.
If my ball and chain ever talked to me...
If she even dared to raise her...
- Do you know what I would say?
- What?
I'd say... Hello, honey.
I...
Well, you think it over.
I'll see you in the morning.
Ooohh, ooohh...
There, now. There. That's better.
I wonder what could be the matter with me.
It looks to me like a severe nervous breakdown.
You've gone all to pieces!
And it happened so suddenly.
Probably that terrible argument we had the other night caused it all.
I wouldn't be a bit surprised.
- Where's Stanley?
- He's gone out.
Where did he go?
He didn't want me to tell you, but he's awfully worried about you and he thought you ought to have a doctor.
Why did you let him do that?
You know I don't like doctors.
Now, now. Don't get all upset.
I know what's good for you.
You're going to have a doctor, and you're going to do just what the doctor says.
Alright, sweetheart. You always know what's best.
Uuhh! Uuhh!
Listen, darling. I'll get you some aspirin.
Oh, and I'll get you some more hot water.
Hey.
- Did you get the doctor?
- He'll be here in a few minutes.
Good. Did you fix it with him to tell me that I have to go to Honolulu for my nerves?
- Our plan is working out great.
- It sure is. I've got it all fixed.
But why do you want to go to Honolulu?
Don't you understand that this is only a subterfuge?
To throw the wives off the track so that we can go to the convention.
Oh, then you're not going to the mountains?
Of course not.
We're supposed to go there so that the wives will think that we...
Not you!
- Stan, did you get a doctor?
- Yes, ma'am. The best in town.
Oh, fine. Here, darling. Here's your aspirin.
Now, take your feet out.
There. Now try that.
Aaargh!
Oh, you poor dear! I'll get you some cold water.
- What are you doing?
- I've lost the aspirin. Can you move over a bit?
Move over a bit more, I can't find it.
Aargh!
Up, out you go!
Oh, you poor thing! Oh, my goodness!
- Oh, you poor darling.
- Get that thing out of there!
Come here, dear. Sit down there.
Why... Aargh!
Get me out of here!
Oh, my boiled little sugar bunny!
I'm so sorry, darling. I'm so sorry.
Ooh!
Get that thing out of here!
Oh, I'm so sorry, darling.
- Oh, darling. You sit down.
- Alright.
I think I'd better go and get some dry clothes on.
Will you get out of my way?
You wax-eater!
Oh...
You're perspiring. Maybe you have got a fever.
I do feel hot.
You'd better take my temperature.
Get that thermometer.
- The what?
- Thermometer. You'll find it on the shelf.
Oh...
What does it say?
"Wet and windy."
That's a barometer!
Why did you get a veterinarian?
I didn't think his religion would make any difference.
This way, Doctor.
- This is Mr Hardy.
- Hello, Doctor.
Doctor, I'm so glad you're here.
My husband's been suffering terribly.
What seems to be the trouble?
I think he's suffering from a nervous shakedown.
Oh.
O-ho...
Aha...
Aha...
My, my, my...
- What is it, Doctor?
- It looks like a bad case of canis deliris.
- As bad as that?
- Even worse.
It might be double canis deliris.
- If it's that bad you should give him something.
- Oh, Doctor! You must give him something.
Now there, darling, you be quiet.
Oh, my poor little lambkin.
He's going to be alright. Yes, he is.
Sit up, sit up.
Open up your mouth.
There, darling.
Everything is going to be alright.
- Do you think I'd better put him to bed?
- No, no.
What he really needs is a long ocean voyage with plenty of tropical air and sun.
I suggest a trip to... a trip to...
..Honolulu.
But Doctor, wouldn't the mountains do as well?
I'm a very bad sailor and
I can't stand the water.
No. I'm sorry, Mrs Hardy.
A voyage to Honolulu is the only cure for your husband.
I won't go to Honolulu.
If you can't go, sugar,
I'lljust stay at home and suffer.
You'll do nothing of the kind.
If the doctor says you must go to Honolulu, you'll do just as the doctor says.
But I can't go to Honolulu alone.
I've got to have someone to take care of me.
Maybe Stanley will be kind enough to go with you.
Well, I never thought of that.
Will you go, Stanley?
- Where?
- To Honolulu!
- I can't go to Honolulu.
- Why?
I'm going to the convention.
What do you mean you're going to the convention?
I forgot to tell you.
I asked Betty and she said that I could go.
That settles it. I'm not going to Honolulu.
Oh, yes, you are. You're going to Honolulu if you have to go alone!
If I have to go to Honolulu alone, he's going with me!
Hey! Kitty, kitty, kitty!
Boo, boo, boo, boo!
Hey! Isn't she a "Dob"?
- Texas 97!
- Texas 93!
- New York 43!
- Washington 27!
Texas 97!
Hey! Oh, no, no, no...
That's still going to go on the floor.
- Well, well, well... California, eh?
Hey, I bet you don't grow flowers there that smell like this.
That's a "Dob", isn't it, boy?
Can you take it?
Say, boys, come on!
Come over to my table and have a drink.
Oh boy, oh boy! Right, sit down.
Sit down!
Hey, waiter! A bottle of champagne!
Oh, boy! Ha, ha, ha!
Have a cigarette.
Have a cigarette.
You guys are killing me!
Great gag, huh? Great gag.
Down on a South Sea island
Underneath the beauty of the stars
I strayed upon some maidens who were strumming on their guitars
A hula maid was dancing and I knew I'd found my paradise
So this is what I told her as I gazed into her eyes
Honolulu Baby where did you get those eyes
And the dark complexion
I just idolise?
Honolulu baby where did you get that style
And those pretty red lips and that sunny smile?
When you start to dance your hula hooping dance
Then you shake it up and down
You shake a little here you shake a little there
When you've got the boys going to town
Honolulu Baby you know your stuff
Honolulu Baby gonna call your bluff
Di, di, di...
You see? We're killing two birds with one stone.
We're seeing as much here as we could've seen in Honolulu.
Hey, what's the laugh? I don't get it.
Shall we tell him?
Our wives think that we're in Honolulu for my health.
You're pulling a fast one, huh?
Oh, boy!
What did I tell you?
We've been to the convention, had a swell time, we're going home in the morning and nobody's any the wiser.
By the way, what part of California are you fellows from?
Los Angeles.
Los Angeles? What a small world, what a small world!
I've got a sister who lives out there.
No kidding. I haven't laid eyes on her since I got out of reform school!
I've got a great idea for a gag.
Know what I'll do?
I'm going to call her up long-distance and disguise my voice so she won't know who it is!
Oh, that's a "Dob"!
Hey, waiter! Another bottle of bubble water.
I'll be right back!
Hello? Hello?
- Here's your long-distance call.
- Oh, swell!
Hello? Hello? Hello?
I'll bet you can't guess who this is!
Alright, who is it?
It's your little brother Charlie.
Well, for goodness' sake!
It's my brother Charlie.
Where are you?
I'm in Chicago.
They're throwing a convention for me.
Well, fancy hearing from you after all these years.
I haven't seen you since you sang in the choir.
And you used to pump the organ, remember?
You little organ pumper, you!
Listen, I want you to talk to a fellow from Los Angeles. A swell guy.
Wait a minute. Here, go ahead.
Hello? So this is Charlie's sweet little sister.
I feeljust like I know you.
Charlie tells me you're from Los Angeles.
What part?
All of me!
What did she say?
She asked me if I was from Los Angeles and I said, "Yes".
Then she said, "What part?" and I said, "All of me!"
Wasn't that a "Dob"?
You little jokester.
When you get back to town, drop in and see me.
I'd just love to have you meet my husband.
I sure will! What's the address?
Write this down.
2-2-2-2 Fairview Avenue.
Eh... Goodbye, sugar.
- What did you hang up for?
- We had a bad connection.
- But isn't she a swell gal?
- She sure is.
- Uh-oh.
- What's the matter, Lottie?
If I didn't know that Oliver was in Honolulu,
I'd swear that was him on the phone.
They're in Honolulu, alright.
But Stanley wouldn't dare lie to me.
I'd hate to think what would happen if he ever did.
Let these fellows have a chance. Come on!
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
- Jack, how are you?
- Glad to see you.
- Am I glad to see you!
- Aahh!
Do you know that's my wife?
Texas 97!
New York 43!
New York 47!
Extra paper!
Get your evening paper!
Honolulu liner sinking! Extra!
Lottie, Lottie! Look!
I just read it. What are we going to do?
I'll telephone the steamship company and ask if they've got a list of survivors.
No! No, we go down there.
Go on, get your hat!
Alright, I'll meet you outside.
Quiet, please!
Mr Ruthbert has a radiogram he wishes to read.
This is the latest wireless report.
"Honolulu Steamship Company, Los Angeles."
"The survivors of the ill-fated liner have been transferred to the rescue ship."
"A list of the casualties will be made known as soon as a complete check-up is made."
"Expect to arrive in port in 36 hours."
Signed, Captain John Zilo.
Oh, Betty. I do hope the boys are safe.
The suspense is just killing me!
Have courage, Lottie.
Let's not think of the worst.
Well, I try not to, but...
I'm so worried about Oliver.
You know how unselfish he always was.
He wouldn't leave that ship until everybody was saved.
Well, if they're safe,
Oliver certainly deserves a medal.
- You know, Stanley can't swim a stroke.
- Oh, I never thought of that!
Here you are, old man. Just keep the change.
Honolulu Baby
Where did you get those eyes
And your dark complexion that I idolise?
Honolulu Baby where did you get those eyes
And your dark complexion that I idolise?
Honolulu Baby where did you get those eyes
and your dark complexion that I idolise?
Maybe they're in Betty's house.
Honolulu Baby
Where did you get those eyes
And your dark complexion that I idolise?
Honolulu Baby where did you get those eyes
And your dark complexion that I idolise?
Honolulu Baby...
Aloha! Baby's here!
Aloha! Baby's here!
Aloha!
Get that thing out of the way!
Aloha!
Aloha!
Baby's home, sugar!
Get out of my way!
Aahh!
- I wonder where she is.
- Maybe she went out.
I know she went out, but what I'd like to know is where did she go!
- Maybe she went to the mountains with Betty.
- That's probably just where she is.
She makes me sick!
She knew we were coming today.
Why did she go to the mountains?
Well, if she didn't go to the mountains,
Mohammed would have to come here.
What has Mohammed got to do with my wife?
"Notes from the clubs".
- Ooohh!
- What's the matter?
"Honolulu liner sinking.
Foundering in typhoon."
"Passengers and crew on SS Muana in panic as wireless fails."
"Sister ship Leuana reaches scene of disaster in 90 mile gale."
"Rescue ship due back in Los Angeles harbour tomorrow."
- Oh...
- Oh!
Can you beat that?
I'm sure glad we didn't go.
If we had...
Ooohh! What are we going to do?
We've got to get out of here.
We'll spend the night in a hotel.
Put that paper down and let's go!
Get that!
Pick that up so they won't know that we've been here.
- Betty, let me...
- No, I'll pay.
Take everything!
Aaahhh!
We'll hide. No, not there! Get up!
- Come on, get...
- Ooohh!
Oh! Get...
- Betty, did you hear that?
- I certainly did.
There's no one in there.
Betty, I could have sworn
I heard that door close.
It's probably our imagination.
We're both so nervous and upset.
Oh, Betty! Do you really think that they're safe?
Don't worry, dear. Let's think for the best.
Oh...
Alright. Ooh!
I have the strangest feeling. I...
I feel as if they were hovering right over me!
Don't talk that way! You give me the jitters!
I'm just going all to pieces!
- If you're going to act that way, I'm going.
- Don't leave me, Betty! Don't leave me here!
We've got to face this situation with determination.
I know, I'm doing the best I can.
- Do you think they saw us?
- Of course not!
If they had, they'd be up here. To catch a Hardy they have to get up very early in the morning.
- What time?
- About half past... What time!
Shh!
Be careful! Do you want them to hear us?
How are we going to get to a hotel?
Simple. We'll go down through Betty's house.
Locked.
- It looks like we're here for the night.
- We can't sit up here all night.
We are not going to sit up all night.
We'll fix ourselves a nice bed and be just as comfortable as two peas in a pod.
Ooh!
Oh...
Give me a hand with the spring.
- Shh!
- Don't shush me!
- Shh!
- Shh!
Hold this while I get some rope.
Don't sit there looking at me. Do something to help me! Get me some rope.
- What are you going to do with it?
- None of your business. Do as I tell you!
- Shh!
- It serves you right!
No, Betty. Now I wish
I'd let him go to the convention.
He could be having such a good time instead of being in that awful shipwreck.
It's all my fault!
Don't worry, Lottie.
Maybe they're not as bad off as we think.
Oh, Betty. If I could only see him once more.
I can't believe it!
Just wait 'til you get back home, you inflated tadpole.
- Sit down!
- Shut up!
- Lottie!
- So Stan wouldn't dare lie to you?
Don't you worry about it.
- Can you imagine them going to that convention?
- I don't mind that so much.
It's the idea of them making a sucker out of me.
That's what burns me up.
- Sit down, Lottie. You make me nervous.
- Oh, shut up!
Stanley wouldn't dare lie to you...
Ha, ha, ha!
It's the first time he ever did, and if it wasn't for your husband's bad influence this wouldn't have happened.
Oh, is that so?
Are you trying to infer that my husband alone was the cause of this?
- I certainly am.
- That wax-eater of yours is no different.
He had just as much to do with it as my Oliver did.
I admit that he lied, but there is one thing that I do know.
When he gets back home and I ask him, he'll confess and tell me everything.
- Ha, ha, ha.
- That's more than that blimp of yours will do.
Just wait 'til I get back home and I'll show youwho the truthful one is.
- I'll show you that my Oliver is upright.
- Oh, skip it.
There you are. Fit for a king!
We'll have a good night's sleep, go down in the morning, tell them about the shipwreck, and nobody will be any the wiser.
- I've got to hand it to you.
- For what?
For the meticulous care with which you have executed your finely formulated machinations in extricating us from this devastating dilemma.
Then, on the other hand...
- Get in bed.
- Huh?
"Meticulous"...
Now hold it for me.
- Now, isn't this nice?
- It sure is.
We're just like two peas in a pot.
Not "pot". "Pod".
Po-d!
Po-d.
Good night, I'll run along.
If they come here first, give me a call.
I'm dyingto hear Oliver's story.
- Oh, Betty! What was that?
- I'll find out.
Wait!
They are probably asleep and didn't hear it.
We sure were lucky.
Oh, Betty! Do be careful.
It might be a burglar.
Don't worry about me. I've got my gun and I've never missed yet.
- Ohh!
- Quick! Let's get on the roof! Come on!
There's something very strange going on.
- I'll call the police.
- That's a fine idea.
- Now what are we going to do?
- What do you think?
I'm not going to sit here all night and catch pneumonia.
We'll ride down the drainpipe, put our clothes on in the garage and go to a hotel.
You can do what you like, but I'm going home.
- What are you going to tell Betty?
- I'll tell her everything.
- So, you're turning yellow.
- Huh?
You're yellow.
- It must be the lightning.
- You little double-crosser!
If you go downstairs and spill the beans,
I'll tell Betty that I caught you smoking a cigarette.
Alright, go ahead and tell her.
What do you think..?
- Would you tell her that?
- I certainly would.
- Would you?
- I would.
You know what we'll do? We'll climb down the garage and change our clothes in the drainpipe.
Then we'll go to a hotel and we'll be just as comfortable as two peas in a po-d.
Go on. Get down. Go on.
You'll have me catching ammonia... pneumonia!
Spread your legs!
- Why did you tell me to spread my legs?
- I didn't want you to get your feet wet.
Help me get out of here!
Don't tell him anything.
- What's going on here?
- Nothing, Officer.
- Where do you live?
- I'd rather not say.
- So you don't want to talk?
- Well, it's just...
- Where do you live?
- Huh?
- Where do you live?
- Next door to him.
- Where does he live?
- In there.
Quit your kidding! Where does he live?
I'm not kidding! If you don't believe me, go in and ask them.
Such a good idea! Come on!
Come on! Get going! Hurry up!
- Is this the house?
- Yes, sir.
Well, here's another nice mess you've gotten me into.
What do we tell them?
- You think up your story, I've got mine.
- I can't think of any.
Hey, here they are now! Where's that gun?
Wait a minute, calm yourself!
Let's hear their story first.
Don't forget, you and I have a little argument to settle. After that, you can do as you please.
Alright, I'll show you.
Thank you, Officer.
Oh, Oliver! What's happened, where are your clothes?
- Wait 'til I get my second wind.
- Stanley, whatever happened?
You tell your story, Ollie.
On our way back from Honolulu we were in a terrible shipwreck.
You see. If you'd let me go to the convention,
I wouldn't have gone through this horrible experience.
Oh, tell us all about it, please!
Alright, alright.
We were sailing along in clear weather when all of a sudden a terrible storm came up.
- Didn't it, Stanley?
- Yeah, and then we floundered in a typhoid.
Not "typhoid". He means "typhoon", sugar.
The ship started to sink and we both dived overboard.
- Didn't we, Stanley?
- Just as the boat went down for the third time.
- And here we are.
- Aren't you glad we got back home safe?
Well, what's new, sugar?
Well, the rescue ship with the survivors doesn't get in until tomorrow.
- The rescue...
- Oh.
- It must have got there after we left.
- Yes, it must have got there after we left.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Well, how did you get here?
- Why... Err...
- Oh, we ship-hiked.
That's right, we...
We ship-hiked.
- Ship-hiked?
- Yes, we thumbed our way.
What do you mean, thumbed your way?
Well... Stan and I would be swimming along, we'd see a boat coming our way, we'd go like that, and they'd pick us up.
- Wouldn't they?
- Yeah.
- That is, if they were going our way.
- Certainly.
You see, Betty? He's no different from the rest!
They're both like two peas in a pod.
- Po-d.
- Shut up!
- Have you anything else to say?
- Why, no.
That's all there is. There isn't any more.
Is there, Stanley?
No, that's our story and we're stuck with it... in it.
- Oliver.
- What, sugar?
Oliver, I want you to be big.
Bigger than you've ever been before.
Are you telling me the truth?
What do you mean, am I telling you the truth?
Do you think a story like that could come from my mind if it wasn't the truth?
It's ridiculous!
- It's absurd!
- It's the silliest thing I've ever heard.
Well, it certainly is.
It's too far-fetched not to be the truth.
- Isn't it, Stanley?
- It's imposterous.
- Stanley?
- What?
Stanley?
Honest confession is good for the soul.
Is Oliver telling the truth?
Go ahead and tell her.
Is he?
No! We went to the convention.
We didn't go to Honolulu at all!
He told me to tell you we were sinking in that shipwreck.
We were up on the roof.
We slept in the attic.
Come on, Stanley.
Come on, Stanley.
How about you and me going to the mountains?
You're not moving out tonight are you, sugar?
Why don't you wait 'til tomorrow morning so that we can talk it over?
See, Stanley? Honesty is the best policy.
Help, help, help!
I'll show you, you Son of the Desert.
Go to a convention, will you? Ha, ha!
Come in.
- What did she say?
- Never mind what she said. What did Betty say?
Betty said that honesty was the best politics.
Look.
Honolulu Baby won't you close those eyes...
So you're John Longhorn eh?
Well John, let's see.
Yep, Uncle Sam has a nice, tidy little something for you, John.
The earnings and interest on your oil lands amounts to just $4000.
Sign your name right here.
Oh, Chris Morrell, step up here will you please?
Hello Nina.
The money from Nina's mother's oil land is amounting to quite a pile.
About $50,000 right now.
If you can locate Nina's father and get his signature to these documents, then Nina will still remain the ward of the
United States government, but you will be her guardian, legally.
[Chris] That ought to be simple enough.
Or if you can bring evidence or proof that her father is dead, then that will clear the situation.
I've got a pretty fair idea that he's still alive.
Well, what did you find out?
The half-breed kid's worth 50,000 right now and if Chris Morrell locates the kid's father and he signs the papers the agent give him, as her guardian Morrell gets $50,000.
Oh, he does?
That is, if he gets to the kid's father before we get to him.
Where are we going, Daddy Chris?
We're headin' north.
Why are we moving away?
I like it here.
To see if we can find your real daddy and if we can, well we may able to scrape up enough money to send you away to school.
But I don't wanna go to school.
I wanna be a cowboy like you.
Aw, girls can't be cowboys.
Can too, I can ride as well as you can.
But you still can't be a cowboy.
What do you want?
I guess you know what we want.
There's no use of beatin' around the bush.
We came here for Nina and we're willin' to offer you a fair proposition for her.
If that's all you came for, you might just as well leave right now.
Now don't get hostile
Chris, you know as well as we do that Sam Black runs things in these parts.
When he sends us out to get the girl, we're gonna get her.
Besides, he's been mighty good to you, offerin' to cut you in on that oil money.
Well anyway, she isn't here.
You can tell Sam Black for me that she's left this part of the country for good.
You can also tell him that if he'd had the nerve to come himself instead of sending you renegades, that I'd have shoved that offer right down his throat.
Now come on, get outta here, all of ya.
We'll get out, maybe she ain't here but we're not givin' up that easy.
We're watchin' you and we're watchin' the place, so don't think you're gettin' away with nothin'.
Can I come out now Daddy Chris?
Oh!
Get her!
Come on Daddy Chris, hit 'em!
Look out, it's me!
What's that?
He's gone.
He got plum away from us.
We better get Sam Black and go after him.
Goodbye little pardner.
You want me to ride all alone?
Well it's the only way out for us.
What about you Daddy Chris?
Oh me, I'll be all right.
Now you ride to the second bend below and you'll hit Snake
Trail, you understand?
Uh huh.
And when you get to Bud Moore's ranch tell him that I sent you.
Tell him where I am and that I'm needin' help.
There's his tracks.
Shorty, you stay with the horses.
The rest of you scatter around that thicket.
Hey fellas, I got him, I got him!
Come on boys, Sam's got him.
Thought you said you got him.
I had him all right, but I guess he got away.
You guess he got away?
He sent that kid on alone while he stayed here to cover the trail, and that kid means $50,000 bucks to us.
Ahh, heeya!
Ahh, heeya, ha!
Get out and see if you can round up them horses.
Is this the Moore ranch?
Used to be, but it's mine now.
Well maybe you could tell me where I can find Bud Moore.
He ain't here.
Oh!
You ain't goin' nowhere.
Let go of that youngster Vic.
You been a hollerin' for kitchen help, well here it is.
Well, what are you doin' here?
Daddy sent me to find Bud Moore and he said he'd take care of me.
We'll take care of ya all right.
Go on, get in the house.
Now you let her alone, if she's gonna help me, I'll take care of her.
All right.
You ain't scared o' me are ya?
Aw you needn't worry none about him as long as I'm here.
Come on, let's go in the house huh?
Now now, there ain't nobody here but you and me.
Up you go there.
Now then, what's your name honey?
Nina Morrell.
Is your pop's name Chris?
Yes, you know him?
Yeah, I used to.
How come he ain't with ya?
Sam Black and his gang were after us and we only had one horse, so Daddy Chris told me to get on and ride him and--
Okay.
Oh Mr. Norton would you order that bowl of calico for me?
I will Miss Clara.
You haven't seen my brother Jim--
No, I haven't.
I thought if he were in town, he might want to ride back with me.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Help!
I'll meet you at the old ranch.
Help, help!
Help, help, help!
I've been robbed, a fellow with a checkered shirt, black hat, and he had a black handkerchief across his face.
No, I tell ya I can't be mistaken.
He had on a checkered shirt and a black hat.
Why, he took $6000 from me and stuffed it into a gunny sack.
- Which way did he go?
- Well I don't know which way he went.
So you can see for yourself there's nothing else for me to do but turn you over to the sheriff.
Seriously ma'am, you've got the wrong man.
Well why are you wearing the checkered shirt and the black hat?
Not to mention the gunny sack.
If I knew who these belonged to,
I'd know who robbed the express office.
You mean they don't belong to you?
That's what I mean.
You expect me to believe that?
Well I hope you will.
And if I did, what would you do?
Well, first I'd see that my little pardner was safe, then I'd find the man that belongs to this shirt.
You wouldn't run away?
Do you think I would?
No, I don't think so.
Where'd you send your little partner?
To Bud Moore's ranch down River Valley.
Bud Moore?
Yes, I used to ride herd with him in the panhandle, you know him?
Why yes, he's my brother.
That is, he was my brother.
I don't quite get you.
Bud's dead.
- Oh.
He was killed in a range war last year.
Oh I'm sorry.
It was a bit of a shock at first, but
I guess you can get used to anything.
Well, did Bud ever mention my name?
Chris Morrell?
Are you Chris Morrell?
Why he used to say you were the best friend a man ever had.
I guess that's puttin' it pretty strong, ma'am.
Clara.
Come on let's go up to my place and change that shirt.
There'll be a lot of people looking for it.
Yes, ma'am, I mean Clara.
Nina's mother was a full blood old sage.
She married a good for nothing white man who left her two months before the kid was born.
Her mother died.
Hello Clara.
Chris, this is my brother Jim.
I'll make you some coffee before you go.
Well thanks ma'am, I mean Clara.
So you're Jim.
What about it?
Nothing, only I came to for a minute when you changed shirts with me at the creek.
Well why don't ya tell her?
In the first place, because it'd break her heart.
In the second place, because snakes like you usually die of their own poison.
What was that noise?
Why, Jim was showin' me his gun and it dropped out of his hand.
Have some coffee Jim?
Not now, later.
I'm glad to have met you.
Same to you.
How do you like Jim?
Well some men are like books written in a strange language, and that makes it awfully hard to read them.
I hope I wasn't wrong in reading you, Chris.
Oh no, ma'am.
You were telling me about
Nina just before Jim came in.
Well Nina--
That guy recognized you, he knows you pulled that job at the express office.
I told you not to stop.
Well I thought it'd be a good way to hang it on him and leave us in the clear.
Where's the money?
The old hollow stump.
Let's go get it.
In order to protect her interests, we started out to find Nina's father.
Sam Black and his gang figured that she was worth a lot of money.
Luckily, I got the best of them and stampeded their horses and made a getaway.
Well I guess I'd better be going.
Oh no, you'd better take this one, it's Jim's.
Thank you.
You'll bring Nina back won't you?
I sure will, Clara.
Thanks a lot.
Goodbye Chris.
Here pig, pig, pig
- Oink, oink, oink.
Pig, pig, pig, pig-
Hey kid, come here.
What's your name?
Nina Morrell.
- Nina Morrell?
- Yes, sir.
Daddy Chris is my daddy.
How come?
She rode in lookin' for Bud Moore.
Vic made her stay.
I didn't know Chris was a squaw man.
He ain't, neither.
What do you mean?
She ain't his kid, she's your kid.
How do you know?
Chris and me was there when she was born and for two days after when your wife died.
Come here kid, I want to talk to ya.
I'll bet that's the bunch that belongs to
Sam Black and his gang.
Gosh, I wish I had somethin' to put on my dogs, they're sure sore.
Well it was your fault for lettin'
Morrell stampede the horses, now go find him.
Well where'll I go?
I don't know of any place around here to get horses.
I don't care where you get 'em, get 'em.
Hey you fellas, wait a minute!
Wait a minute there.
Them's our horses.
- Who's ours?
Sam Black and the boys.
Sam Black?
That's the man I wanna see.
Well come on, we're camped right over yonder.
Got our horses back.
- Sam Black?
- That's me.
You lookin' for a half-breed kid named Nina Morrell?
- You said it.
- I got her.
What's the idea?
I'll exchange if you count me in.
For how much?
10,000 and--
What's the and for?
Chris Morrell's scalp, do you know him?
Yeah, where do I find him?
Clara Moore's homestead,
I'll show ya how to get there.
You're on.
Good, you cut me in for 10,000 and bring the scalp of
Chris Morrell to my ranch and I'll turn the kid over to ya.
Where's your place?
Here, I'll show ya how to get from the Moore homestead to my ranch.
Why Matt Downing, you old buzzard.
Chris Morrell.
I know from the what the kid said you couldn't be far away.
Well is she all right?
Where is she?
At the Byrd ranch, used to be Bud Moore's.
Dad's there too.
- Her dad?
Yeah, come on, I'll tell you all about it on the way.
It's a cinch.
All right, I'll be seein' ya, come on fellas.
50/50 on that money for the kid.
Sure, but we'll go split that express money first.
Look!
Vic got me.
Vic Byrd?
He made me rob the express office and he got the money.
You know where he went?
Yeah, to the ranch to get your kid.
To give her to Sam Black.
Please don't tell my sister about me.
Get him into a doctor, quick, and bring the sheriff back with you.
Where's Chris Morrell?
- He's gone.
- Where?
I don't know.
Take a look inside, she might be lyin'.
- There's nobody inside.
- All right.
You're ridin' with us, maybe you can remember where he went.
Look out now, look out, hold on tight,
I'm gonna buck ya!
Hold on now, oh he's a regular old sun fish this horse is.
What's the idea?
Well you see, she's my kid, Vic.
I just found it out, my kid.
Yeah, well she's worth
10,000 bucks to me.
What do you mean?
I told Sam Black I'd turn her over for 10,000.
Well you're out of luck, she's worth more than that to me.
You better change your mind, Tom.
You heard me.
You keep your hands off my kid.
I ain't takin' orders from you.
Daddy, Daddy Chris!
Sam Black and his gang.
- Look out, Chris!
They won't get my kid.
Who told you she was yours?
Matt told me, and Vic told me about
Sam Black and his gang wantin' her.
I got an idea without us takin' any more chances.
Empty.
Hey fellas!
One left.
Fellas!
Hey you!
Hey you fellas!
Hey there, trade you the woman for the kid.
How about it?
Hey fellas, what's the matter with ya, ya deaf?
Trade you the woman for the kid, did you get it?
No, not in a million years!
Don't worry little pardner, I wouldn't give you up for anything.
Hey Sam Black, are you listenin'?
Yeah, say it.
- How'd you like to trade me for the woman?
- Sure.
You're on, come out with your hands in the air and we'll send the woman at the same time.
Only one cartridge left, and I've got an idea.
Come on.
Come on.
Be sure and use that last bullet right.
Goodbye, cowboy.
Keep going Clara, no matter what happens.
Now rush 'em.
Help!
Help!
That kid's comin' with me.
Oh no she's not.
Where's Nina?
Black took her.
Naughty, naughty!

[Engine revving]
[Tires screeching]
[Crowd screaming]
[Instrumental music]
[Music continues]
[Train chugging]
[Engine revving]
Make the back one little richer.
That's alright.
Hey, what makes that smoke?
Castor oil.
Don't you like it?
Well, that makes me feel kinda funny.
Yeah, it effects a lot of people that way.
[Train whistling]
We're passing through this farm, Spud.
Getting near your hometown, huh, Joe?
'Yeah.'
You guys better get cleaned up.
- We'll be in there few minutes.
- Suits me.
I've been lookin' at carburetors for so long
I'm beginning to see 'em in my dreams.
[Door opens]
Hello, Joe.
'Hello, Lee.
Everything packed?'
- Yeah.
- 'That's nice.'
I wish I was getting off with you.
- Which one do you want?
- The silk one.
Kid brother will have it in his pocket.
I'd like to meet him.
What's he like?
Small kid.
I haven't seen him in...
I haven't seen him in four years.
He thinks I'm the one right guy in the world.
- He oughta get around more.
- What?
I think the same way he does, Joe.
Only...
Only what?
Oh, nothing.
Come on, spill it.
Just about you and me.
We've been over on that before
And you said you understood.
Understanding doesn't mean I like it.
I want to be sure of it, Joe.
- I want...
- I know.
You want... this.
Mm-hm.
Doesn't look bad at that.
Joe, don't.
Don't I mean anything at all to you?
One smart crack and you think you fixed up everything.
I wasn't being smart, Lee.
There was a time when that was alright.
When I first met you,
I just wanted a good time.
And you felt the same way.
But things are different, Joe.
And I've changed.
But you haven't.
That's the trouble.
I often wonder what you really think of me.
I've never known.
Do you ever wonder what I think of you?
- 'Did you?'
- No...
You're somebody who thinks all you've to do is win a race
And bring home a trophy, and first prize money
And I'm satisfied.
But you're wrong.
When you get back from a race
And when I see that checkered flag, I'm happy.
Not because you've won, but because I've got you back.
You're safe.
Oh, Joe, why do you go on, anyway...
Risking your life for nothing?
Grinding away.
Little money, few cups.
Crowd yelling in the grand stand.
A lot of people watching for wrecks and roaring for blood.
All they wanna see is that
Car turn over so they can hold their breath.
And the ambulance takes away what's left of you.
The point to it and say
"Ooh, isn't that awful?
They're taking him away."
That's why I want you to quit driving.
That's why we should stop drinking too.
If you'd stop, maybe you'd listen to reason.
And you talk about setting an example
For that kid brother of yours.
That's funny.
All those homefolks, that
I'm not good enough to meet.
How do you think that makes me feel?
[Train whistling]
It's your station, Joe.
Love me?
I love you, too.
We'll take it up at the next meeting.
[Knock on door]
Come in.
- You've bags, sir?
- Yeah.
Huh. I'll shoot you a wire when I get through Haydock.
- Alright. Goodbye, Joe.
- Bye, sweets.
You hate that guy, don't you?
Take care of him for me,
Spud, will you?
Oh, sure. I guess we both like him pretty much.
So long.
Have a good trip, Lee.
I will.
Joe, I'm Eddie.
Ha ha.
I'm glad you told me.
Oh, you have grown!
What have they been feeding you?
Joe.
Hello, dad. I'm glad to see you.
You're looking swell.
I'm glad to see you too, son.
'Mr. Greer, would you hold it for a picture please?'
Alright dad, get over here and let's get this over with.
Alright, now that's fine.
I'll hold it perfectly still for you.
- Alright, thanks.
- I appreciate it.
I think I'm running for office.
Oh, dad. This is Spud Connors, my relief driver.
How do you do?
Alright, Mr. Greer.
And, uh, Spud, this is Eddie.
- Hello, Eddie.
- Hi.
We're always glad to meet any of your friends.
'Certainly heard a lot about you and Eddie, Mr. Greer.'
'Yes, we've heard a lot about you, too.'
'And they are, Mr. Greer.'
That's a real racing car, Eddie.
- I can see that.
- Look.
Why is the color red?
[Indistinct chattering]
'Right over there.'
I'll bet this baby sure can hop.
- That's it,
- Okay.
Boy, it sure is a honey.
- Like it?
- Yes sir.
The place ain't what it used to be, Joe.
A lot of new fangled ideas coming in right along.
It looks great, dad.
Say, dad, uh, get any drink around here?
Uh, sure.
Well, kid.
What's this?
At the time you cracked up in Syracuse.
'Gosh! We sure were scared until we telephoned that hospital.'
Riding the car hundred miles an hour.
Gosh! How did you get out of it?
Hm, just remembered the duck.
There's my old car.
Oh, hey, Joe.
Which do you like best?
The Duisenberg or the new front drive Miller?
All depends on the track.
Hey... you're pretty interested in this, aren't you?
I'll say I am.
That's alright, only don't let it throw you.
What's that?
Turn on that light, will you, dad?
Well?
What do you think of it?
Will it go?
I mean, anything but downhill.
Sure, it will run.
Parts of it look like they're old quarter mile.
Well, that's what it came from mostly.
As the axle, dad and I built it.
Can you make ice-cream with it, Eddie?
Oh!
What you've been doing with this crate?
What's he been doing?
Look at that!
That's what he's been doing.
How long you've been driving?
All this summer.
I cleaned up on it too.
See, Joe, I love it.
I just wanted you to be proud of me.
I-I just thought that
Perhaps if you-if you saw how well I could drive that...
When you go away you might take me with you. Will you, Joe?
It's up to you, Joe.
Sit down, kid.
I wanna talk to you.
So you want to be a race driver?
Just like your big brother, Joe, huh?
Well, I'll change place with you right now.
What do you think of that?
Don't let those goofy signs go to your head.
Listen, kid.
I've seen lot of kids start up from all over the country.
Grinding away year after year.
Rotten dangerous tracks.
Dirt, grime, working all hours of the night.
Getting crippled up or killed, for what...
Sea shells and squash, maybe a few bucks a race, that's all.
Everybody can't win a cup or prize money every time out.
Listen, kid.
I know a lot of boys.
Good fast drivers, fast cars.
And they never win a race.
Just don't get the brakes, that's all.
And if it's glory you're looking for, forget it.
Crowd's gonna come out, watch you, and cheer for you.
What are they watching for?
Cheering for?
They watching for wrecks, and roaring for blood.
If you get killed that doesn't make any difference.
But you don't always get killed.
You get crippled, and messed up for life.
You're a hero today, and a bum tomorrow.
And there's no pension for cracked up race drivers.
There's one thing nobody can do it.
We can't take the roar of the crowd to the bank
And cash in on it.
I'm telling you, stay out of it.
There's no game for anybody to be getting into it.
Why are you in it, Joe?
That's got nothing to do with it.
You think you can drive?
You don't know what it's all about.
I'm telling not to go into it.
Not go in it?
What do you mean?
I'm in it.
And I'm gonna be right where you are one of these days.
All I wanted was to be good enough
So that you wouldn't be ashamed of me.
They all think I'm pretty good.
When you give me all that talk you give me...
Well, don't make any difference.
I'm racing now and I love it.
Better than anything!
If you feel that way about it, all I gotta say is
I'll be in the wheel of that crate, as you call it tomorrow.
I'll be in the first heat,
I'll qualify in the second
And in the third I'll show you whether I can drive or not.
Alright, kid.
Change that manifold, put on two carburetors and it'll go faster.
Come on, dad.
What does he mean, Spud?
We've been using two, gives you better flow at high speeds.
- Have you got any extra ones?
- I think so?
Will you help me change?
Oh, sure.
You mean, tonight, Eddie?
Sure.
'Howdy, folks. Well here we're for another Sunday's racing.'
'Down in the pits the boys are doing'
'Final checkups on their cars'
'And some of them are making few warm up laps before the start.'
As you know the highlights of today's events
Will be the exhibition between
Joe Greer, three times
Indianapolis champ
And his brother Eddie Greer, local champ.
You follow me where ever I go.
Stay on my tail.
Alright, fellas.
Start up at the line.
Right.
[Engine revving]
Give us a hand, will you?
Alright, Greer.
Come on, boys, give him a push.
The first main event will be a ten lap race.
'Drivers wheeling the cars out now, folks.'
'Re-start them.'
'Now, they're doing the usual preliminary warm up laps'
'To get in position.'
Hey, Eddie.
Be a good boy, and I'll give you a show.
'Here they come down the straight away.'
There's the flag and they're off.
'There goes Eddie Greer into the lead.'
Eddie Greer is still in the lead
And Joe is right behind him.'
That's it, Eddie boy.
Give it all.
[Tires screeching]
[Coughing]
[Crowd screaming]
Joe Greer made a couple of monkeys out of us.
[Laughing]
[Indistinct chattering]
'Here we go again. Boys are warming up for the next lap.'
Eddie Greer is in post position out
And Joe Greer is on the outside.
[Engines revving]
Watch yourself.
Here they come down the straight away.
The flag man is ready and they're off.
Here goes Joe Greer into the lead.
Spud Connors is coming up along side of Eddie.
And they've got him in a pocket.
Joe Greer is still in the lead, brother Eddie right behind him.
Joe's getting a taste of his own medicine this time.
[Laughing]
[Laughing]
[Crowd screaming]
Bill, you go and get the boy, and I'll get the help.
Are you hurt?
I'll be alright.
I guess I'll be alright, Joe.
I should've known what it takes to be like a driver.
Don't let that bother you.
You're not the first one to crack up a car.
Yeah, but I still like this old car.
Makes me feel kinda...
Maybe we'll get you another one.
How'd you like to drive 25?
That's your car.
You sure pick a rut time to kid me.
I'm not kidding.
You mean you gonna take me with you?
You gonna show me how to drive?
I'm not gonna show you anything.
All I'm gonna do is put a decent car on you.
You're under contract from now on.
Jeez, oh, you mug...
Alright, forget it.
But don't forget this.
From now, no more of those crazy skids in my cars.
Racing's more with your head, not with just a heavy foot.
When you come into a turn, don't go in wide open.
- Who's it from, Lee? Joe?
- Who else?
From the looks of your face
He won't be home till Christmas the next year. Let's see.
Ha. Right again.
Playing nurse made her a kit, huh?
I suppose, you'll stay home and keep the kettle boiling.
No fun, no dates, no shows, no nothing.
Sittin' at home taking care of the light house.
'You're right, maybe I'm crazy.'
- You don't understand...
- Oh, that's a sucker's alibi.
Some people are born dumb but not you.
I knew you when you were smart.
But you're getting dumber and dumber every day.
I'm glad you were here when I got that wire.
What would I do without you?
You're so cheerful.
I better tell Joe not to come home with you around.
I'm sure I could spend a happy winter.
- You sarcastic?
- Not particularly.
You get off your ideas about men and his style.
If it isn't intelligent, it's original.
What I know about men,
I learn from you.
I've had my share and
I'm not quotin' any books.
You can take those hard drinkin' men and put 'em in a truck
And shove them over a cliff, as far as I am concerned.
And he thinks he's ridin' in a one-seater, he's ridin' alone.
He doesn't know that you're covering every lap with him.
And that guy especially.
Don't know why you stick to him.
- He's no good.
- I know. I know all about him.
He's everything you were going to say and more.
But what you gonna do?
- I love him.
- Well, why don't he marry you?
Guess I said the wrong thing again.
Well, I gotta go.
So long, kid.
Don't worry, Lee.
I'll see you when
I get back home.
[Indistinct announcement]
Here comes your daddy, darling.
Hello.
Hello, Joe.
Hello, Lee.
Gee, it's great to see you.
It's great to see you too.
Oh, uh. Oh, Lee, this is Eddie.
- Lee Merrick.
- How do you do?
I've heard so much,
I feel that I know you.
Yeah. Well, I know you too.
'Hey, Eddie.'
I want you to meet my wife, Mrs. Connors.
- How do you do?
- And this is Michael.
- Hiya, Michael.
- Hello.
- Hello, Ruth.
- Hello, Joe.
Hello, Mike.
Hiya, son.
Say hello, Uncle Joe.
Hello, Uncle Joe.
Well, we'll be going.
Come on, Michael.
- So long, Joe.
- So long, Spud.
- Goodbye.
- Bye-bye, Ruth.
This fellow's growing up, he's heavy.
You bet.
He's a big man now.
- You a big man, Michael?
- Yeah.
Racing drivers have no right to have kids.
Eddie, you and Red go and see that other baggage, will you?
- I'll see you out front.
- Alright.
Where are we going to meet Eddie?
Uh, Lee, you go and take this cab home,
I'm going to take the kid over to the shop.
That's alright. I'm in no hurry. I'll go with you.
Oh, no, we're gonna be quite a while.
Joe, I thought we...
I hope we don't...
Lee, the kid doesn't know anything at all about us.
Both of us have to soft-pedal while he's around.
You understand?
Yeah, I understand. Sure.
We can't go on like we were, on account of him.
I'll wire the hotel for that apartment down the hall.
The kid and I will take that.
That's all right with you, isn't it?
- Yeah. It's okay.
- That's fine.
Come on, we're holding up the train.
We'll talk it over tomorrow.
[Doorbell buzzing]
Come in.
Hi.
I'm dead. Days like this is a strong burden.
Got something cool for little Anne?
Help yourself.
What you've been doing lately?
'Nothing.'
Seen Joe?
No.
That's what makes you look so happy, huh?
- I don't feel very well.
- Oh, now, don't give me that.
Joe's written all over your face.
You've been cryin'?
What this country needs is a
Broken heart insurance for us women.
Those mugs get it for broken bones
And it's us that need protection.
I've had my share and I'm cured.
And I'm gonna stay that way.
What's Joe been doing lately?
Spending time at the track with his brother.
Training him and working nights at the shop.
How do you know?
I hear him come in.
Oh, laying awake at nights too, huh?
Why doesn't he take you along with him?
Why? 'Cause he thinks
I'm not good enough.
That's why.
I'm not good enough.
Oh, now we're getting a low down.
He thinks I'm a bad influence on that kid.
What kind of a kid is he?
A sissy or something?
Never heard of a race track driver
Having a brother like that before. Gee, what a break.
You had it coming. I hate to rub it in, in a time like this
But when I talk to you, you act like you wanna call the militia.
[Doorbell buzzing]
That might be Joe.
Now, go on, powder your face.
Hello.
Oh, it's you, is it?
What do you want?
I'm looking for Miss Merrick.
I'm Eddie Greer.
Oh, come in.
Lee, you've got a guest.
Hello, Lee.
Hello, Eddie.
- How are you?
- Swell.
- Do you know Miss Scott?
- Well, no...
- Yeah, we met.
- Yeah.
Come on, sit down.
I can't stay very long.
Joe left the track before I did.
I thought maybe come up here.
Couldn't wonder he'd leave you alone that long.
- Huh?
- Been very busy, Eddie?
Yeah, I'll say we have.
Say, can I have one?
Sure, help yourself.
Gosh, I've been down that track every day now.
I'm just about getting the feel of it too.
Say, do you ever seen me drive?
No. That's a thrill
I'm saving up.
Well, here's to you.
Pretty good.
Fifty million race drives can't be wrong.
[Doorbell buzzing]
- Hello, Joe.
- Hello, baby.
Oh, you have company.
Just Eddie and Anne.
- Hello, Anne.
- Hi.
Didn't you know we're going out to dinner?
- Get cleaned up.
- Oh, what's the rush?
- Come on, snap out of it.
- Okay.
- So long.
- Goodbye.
Goodbye, uh, glad I met you.
I'll see you again.
I'll hurry.
Fine couple of tramps, you two.
What's the idea?
Feeding that kid stuff like this.
Oh, Joe. He only had one.
He asked for it himself.
You didn't have to give it.
What're you sounding off like that for?
- Think we're ruining him?
- You're all tricked out.
Stand on your head while you're about it.
You can't treat her that way.
I don't care who you're with.
Don't throw him with this dame.
Who are you talking to?
Think you're at the race track?
- Shh, Anne...
- Don't shh me.
He may mean something to you
But he's a greasy truck driver to me.
- You can't talk to me that way.
- Get out!
Let me alone. You let me alone, did you hear me?
[Indistinct shouting]
Open that door, you hear me? Open it.
Listen, Lee.
I've got something to say to you and it's just between us.
Sit down.
Listen, Lee.
What I'm gonna say, isn't gonna be easy.
It's been on my mind ever since I got back.
I want you to know, I feel the same about you as I always have.
But the way things are working out.
Well, the set up is all wrong.
- Lee... we're calling it quits.
- What do you mean?
It's on account of the kid, you understand?
He's still wet behind the ears.
Doesn't know what it's about.
- What's that got to do with me?
- Just this.
This is a tough racket.
And I'm in a tough spot.
I got the kid into this. And I'm gonna see that he gets a break
Personally, I've nothing against you.
Nothing against me?
I'm alright but not good enough for that kid brother of yours?
Now, don't get excited.
Come on, quit stalling, Joe.
Let's have it
What're you driving at?
Alright. You're asking for it,
I guess you'll have to take it.
I asked you when you first met him to soft-pedal him.
I come here and he's lopping up booze with you.
That was the pay off. I'm going to keep him off booze and women.
Booze and women?
Now I know where I stand
Women.
Every woman knows what a man means by that.
But she thinks he means someone else, not herself.
Well, I know what you mean.
I'm not that dumb.
You made it clear, plenty clear.
We're through, huh?
That's your payoff?
Well, here's mine.
I'm sorry, Joe.
Joe, don't go.
I didn't mean that. I didn't mean it. I'm sorry.
Joe, please.
No, it doesn't matter.
Nothing matters as long as you stay, Joe.
Joe, you can hit me.
Joe, please.
[Crying]
What happened, Lee?
I got the air.
For good.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Oh, I can't let him go.
I can't.
Everything was alright till that kid came into it.
Joe, still loves me.
I was good enough for him
But I'm not good enough for that kid.
Come on, we'll show that white guy a thing or two.
What does he think he's got there? A six year old?
Somebody ought to take that little tin hero out and...
I'll do it myself.
Let Joe find out what it's like to lose somebody you care about.
And then maybe he'll comeback.
I can't let him go,
Anne. I can't.
Workin' hard?
Well.
- Hello.
- Hello, yourself.
- Were you looking for someone?
- Mm-hmm.
Well, Joe's down at the...
Say, you didn't come clear out here to see me, did you?
Well, I didn't say that I did.
No. Suppose you wanted to see the car.
She sure is a sweet job.
'She's a Miller, four cylinder,
16 valve, overhead camshaft.'
'She turns about 6000.'
Well, she's sure gonna give Joe quite a run for his money.
Say, why don't you come out and watch us race?
Well, why don't you take the afternoon off to persuade me?
- Do you mean that?
- 'Ah-ha.'
Well, you're the funny...
You change...
Will you wait till I clean up?
Longer than that.
[Doorbell buzzing]
Hello, Spud.
Come on in.
- How are ya, Lee?
- I'm alright.
I don't know whether I should have come in to see you or not.
Why not?
I don't want you to think I'm not minding my business but...
Well?
- It's about Eddie, and Anne.
- What about 'em?
Oh, I don't have to have a house there
To know what's going on.
Eddie's crazy about that girl, Lee.
He's cuckoo.
What would suggest
I do about it?
I don't know.
I just thought I'd come here to tell ya.
I didn't know whether you know how Joe felt.
- Joe?
- Yeah.
He's on to it.
He's burnin' up
Yes, sir.
He's plenty sore.
Well, let him get sore.
No, no, Lee, that ain't so good.
I tell ya, he's burning up.
He's on his way here now.
To top it all of, he's been drinking.
- Drinking?
- You know what that means?
Why, Spud, he's racing at escot tonight.
That guy means a lot to you, don't he?
I'm no Budinsky.
You know me.
I'm the last guy in the world
To poke my nose in anybody else's business but
I'd like to see you and Joe get together.
Wife was saying only yesterday, how much she misses you lately.
I know, Spud.
I miss you too.
But I don't know what can be done about...
Ah, It's all a lot of foolishness.
Some day that Joe's gonna get wise to himself that he's wrong.
You can't grow wings on that kid.
Any kid.
But right now,
Joe's on the war path.
I wish you'd tell those kids what they're running into.
I will.
Well.
That's what I came up to tell you.
So long, Lee.
Good bye, Spud
Anne?
'What's the matter?
What've you been doing?'
Just making a fool of myself, that's what I've been doing.
Well, there's nothing original in that.
I know others that...
Oh, please let me low.
Everything's wrong.
Say, what's the matter with you?
Is it about Eddie?
Huh-ha.
I don't get you.
Well, I might as well tell you now as later.
I sold out on that frame of a box.
That kid.
I'm crazy about him.
'You mean in love?'
That's an awful big word, I know.
But if that's it,
I got it bad.
I feel different somehow.
I take back all
I said about men.
I've never so happy in all my life.
So after you go ahead and laugh, see if I care.
I don't feel like laughing, Anne.
Well, do something, will you?
You got me into this.
What do we do next?
The next thing is, what're you gonna say to Joe?
Yeah. I've been thinking about that too.
Well, think fast.
Spud told me, he was on his way up here.
Well, go on, kid.
Leave me alone, will ya?
I gotta figure this out by myself.
I didn't hear you knock.
Since when does a dame like you expect guys to knock?
I still say, I didn't hear you knock.
I heard you the first time.
I told you to lay off that kid brother of mine.
Yes, you did.
Well, I wasn't clowning.
I meant it.
No mistake in what you meant, Joe
Then what are you after?
The kid hasn't got any dough.
That should let you out.
Nothing let's me out.
I'm after happiness.
Get that?
- Happiness.
- Yeah? Well, get this.
If you know what's good for you, you'll give my brother a year.
For keeps, you understand?
That's pretty large order, Joe.
You can't deal with human beings like you're trying to deal.
I don't care if Eddie is your brother.
I love him and I think he loves me.
What does a dame like you know about love?
Oh, don't talk to me like that, Joe.
What have I done to rate that?
Give me a chance, wouldn't you, please?
I am giving you a chance. To get out of his life and stay out.
Oh, Joe, be decent.
You haven't any right to talk to me like that.
Oh, no?
Well, how about that other guy you're running around with?
- Does Eddie know about that?
- No, he doesn't.
Oh, but that's all over.
Over and forgotten.
What's the kid gonna say when he hears about it?
Alright.
You tell him.
That's you're privilege
You tell him.
You have the right to do that.
Go on, tell him, I say.
Tell him and get it over with.
'Tell him, I say. Go on.'
Go on, tell him.
Well, go on.
Tell me, Joe.
Go ahead, start in.
Tell him.
I'll go out.
Oh, you'll stay right here.
Anything he's got to say, he can say it to the both of us.
Come on, Joe.
You're making a big mistake, kid.
You're throwing a swell chance away.
That isn't what you're going to say...
Yes, it is. I'm only trying to make you see
That you're throwing everything into the gutter.
I've been around.
I've seen a like this dame.
She set out to get you
'cause you're coming up.
Don't say that.
- Don't think you're the first.
- Don't say that.
I'll say plenty more.
She's no good, she's nothing...
You're big man, huh?
You sap.
'I jumped you out of a hick town garage into a big time racing.'
'And now you're gonna jump back.'
Go on, get a car.
See how far you can go.
You're on your own.
I'm through.
Hurt you, Eddie?
No.
Gee, I don't know what to say.
I'm awfully sorry.
Ah, don't be sorry, Anne.
I'm not.
He was wrong in more ways than one.
I'll get a car and
I'll race tonight.
And I'll get even for the both of us.
'What a night and what a crowd.'
'The last race of the thrilling series we've ever had.'
'Under these big brilliant flood lights'
'One of the greatest aggregation of famous drivers'
'Ever assembled on an American track.'
Fourteen of the fastest cars in the world being tuned up
For the main even of
100 death defying laps.
'Listen to those race cars engines thundering'
'As they tune them up.'
[Engines revving]
Hey, Joe, lay off that stuff, will you?
Stick to your drowning and mind your own business.
Handle that 25 like I told you.
'Well, here's a surprise.'
'Number 25 with Spud Connors, substituting for Eddie Greer'
'Kid brother with the famous, Joe.'
'Here's Joe Greer now, in post position, number one'
'Due to the best qualifying lap of the evening.'
'Here's car number eight.
Boy, what a car that is.'
'The Duncan Martin special and...'
Wait a minute.
Here is news.
It's been driven by Eddie Greer.
Seems that there's been some trouble in the Greer family.
When the kid goes out to snatch at brother Joe's laurels.
'We're getting under way now.'
'They have their temperaments and superstitions.'
Hey, Spud.
'They'll take a lap for the warm up'
'And then dock in for position.'
'Like their nice position, what a perfect line up.'
'They're in the starting line.'
'Green flag will mean that they're away.'
'There's the flag.
They're off.'
'There goes Joe Greer, number one, into the lead.'
'Closely followed by
Eddie Greer in number eight.'
Joe Greer is still in the lead
But Eddie Greer is right on his tail.
'And it looks like he's gonna cut loose, folks.'
It's a grudge race and that spells danger on any track.
'Look at Eddie pull up on brother Joe.'
[Crowd cheering]
- I don't like this, Lee.
- Don't worry.
I know, but the way those two feel, I'm afraid.
'Fighting it out with everything they've got.'
'There goes Eddie into the lead.'
'Joe seem to be having some trouble and is he mad.'
'Look at that boy go now.'
'He's really after Eddie.'
'And the third party in the family tussle, is Spud Connors'
'In number 25, has wedged himself between Joe and Eddie.'
'Looks like Connors is acting as the peacemaker'
'At this record breaking pace.'
'He won't move aside and he hasn't'
'Even tried to pass young Greer.'
'This is sensational, a triple-header on a race track.'
'Joe is waving Connors to get out of his way. But he won't.'
'After all he's in there to stay.'
'Number 69.
I don't think he's hurt.'
'Looks like they'll end up in the same position'
'Unless Joe Greer decides to take a chance.'
'Connors is gonna hold on to number two position.'
'And he has to let
Joe Greer climb over him.'
'Number 37 crashed and turned over.'
'Hope he's alright.'
'This Greer family feud seems to be greasing'
'To the other drivers.'
'Connors still in the same position.'
'Joe Greer doesn't seem to be able to force his way in.'
'No report on the other crashes yet.'
'There he goes
Joe now.'
'It's a desperate chance he's taking.'
'He's trying to push his way past number 25.'
'Please keep your seats, everyone.'
'There're a number of cars and
I can't make out who it is yet.'
'But the driver may be able to escape injury.'
- Who is it?
- I don't know. I can't see.
'The other cars are trying to avoid the fire'
'The driver of the burning car is trying to stop it.'
'The fire has made too much head way and is out of control.'
'There he goes over the upside rail. It is very serious.'
'It's still burning.
I don't know who it is yet.'
'Here comes the other cars.'
'Here's Eddie Greer.'
'There's Joe Greer.'
'There's Bud.'
And I don't see Spud Connors...
[Screaming]
Let me go.
That's my husband.
Nick Wilbur is pulling in to the pits.
'We'll be able to tell you in just a minute what's happened.'
'Why are you pulling in?
What is it?'
It's Spud Connors.
I can't get through that again.
'There goes Joe Greer, number one.'
'Doesn't look like he's injured though.'
[Crying]
Hey, Anne.
Anne?
'Anne?'
- What is it? Bad news?
- No, look here.
- Oh...
- Wait. I'll read it for you.
"Mr. Edward Greer."
That's me.
- No.
- Yeah.
- "9632 cal..."
- Oh, hurry up.
"Have new dues and berg ready for Indianapolis race.
"Would like to have you drive, usual terms.
"Auggie says it'll go.
"Wire your answer."
And signed Fred Duesenberg.
Oh, gee, Eddie. That's what you've always wanted, isn't it?
- Yeah.
- Well, did you wire him?
Uh, did I? I almost broke my leg getting down here.
- You happy?
- Now you're asking me riddles?
Haven't been so happy since I got that.
[Doorbell buzzing]
Get the lipstick off and clean up.
Go on, dinner's ready.
Hello, Lee.
Come on in.
Gee, it's good to see you.
- Like our place?
- Nice, Anne.
Hey, why don't you been to see us?
Oh, I don't know.
Let me look at you.
What's the matter, heard from Joe?
- No.
- News about him?
Yeah.
Sit down.
Lost his nerve, huh?
Oh, well, maybe it isn't true.
- You know how the papers talk.
- Of course it isn't true.
Joe's not yellow. He's got more nerve than anyone living.
If he can't drive, it's just because...
Well, because he's broken and sick.
That's all.
Maybe you're right.
Oh, not hearing from Joe all these months is been awful.
Just torture. I've tried to forget him, but I can't.
Now I've got to find him.
And help him.
Be near him if he needs me.
He hardly rakes that after the way he treated you.
Oh, what's the difference if he rakes it or not?
Even if he doesn't need me, I need him.
I lie awake at nights seeing Joe somewhere off by himself.
Trying to forget Spud.
Drinking.
Hanging around race tracks.
Alone.
Sick maybe.
My Joe.
Ooh, don't cry, Lee.
That won't help any.
How do you expect to find him?
The race at Indianapolis next month. He'll be there.
Well, he hasn't entered a car.
Did you ever know race driver who stayed away?
Anne, that's why
I came tonight.
I'm broke.
Flat.
Would you loan me the railroad fare?
Well, sure. I've got it.
- Here it is.
- Hello, Lee.
Hello, Eddie.
What's this?
Anne's lending me money to go to Indianapolis.
To find Joe. I've heard news about him.
I'm not interested in anything Joe does.
You know that and so does Joe.
Anne wants you to have the money that's her affair.
Leave me out of it.
Here you are, Lee.
Good luck.
We'll see you in Indianapolis.
- Goodbye, Eddie
- Goodbye.
- Bye, Lee.
- Goodbye.
Don't you think you were a little unkind?
Oh, I'm sorry, Anne.
That's the way
I feel about it.
[Train chugging]
That's your load.
Get outta here.
[Engine revving]
'Oh, Harry.
Harry Hartz.'
Hello, Joe.
- Joe Greer, how are you?
- Fine, Harry.
- Where you been?
- I've been out in the states.
Harry, uh, you haven't got a spot for me, have you?
Well, you mean driving, Joe?
Yeah.
I'm sorry, Shorty Cantlon's driving in relief for me.
Hello, Joe.
'Hello, Shorty.'
Alright.
Thanks, Harry.
Thanks.
Oh, Joe, I could, uh...
Oh, no thanks, no, I don't need it.
I'll see Fred Frame.
Hello, Fred.
Hello.
How you doin'?
Why, hello, Joe.
How are you?
I'm fine, I'm fine, thank you.
Say, you couldn't use an extra driver, could you?
Sorry, Joe, wish you'd been around a couple of days ago.
Just a little late, huh?
I'm afraid you are.
Well, thanks anyhow, Fred.
Good luck to you boy.
Thanks, Joe.
So long.
Gee I hate to lie to that guy.
Yeah, Fred, and I guess he knew you were lying.
He probably did.
Well, hello, Joe.
Hello, Bill.
Good to see you here again.
- Glad to be here.
- What're you gonna drive?
I, uh, I'm looking for a car.
I can't get one of 'em.
A ride mechanic
I'd do anything I can get.
I wish I could help you.
But I've got a full crew.
Alright, Bill.
If I get a car,
I'll tow you.
Okay, boy.
Why didn't you take him on?
We need a new pit man.
Pit man? You know who that guy is?
That's Joe Greer, one of the best men
That ever sat behind the wheel.
How can you tell him to crawl under a car?
Boy, you did alright.
What did I do?
Turn down those carburetor a little, I'll try it again.
Hey, Tom.
How come you got Arnold's picture of first place up there?
Because he's a great boy, and got a fast car.
And that is a combination hard to beat.
When you get good enough, and fast enough...
Your name will go up on that board too.
Alright, Tom.
Joe!
Joe Greer, come here.
Joe, I sure am glad to see you.
Hiya, Tom.
If I had known you were here...
I'd have your name on that board sure.
Whatcha driving?
- I'm not driving.
- What?
No, I haven't got a car, Tom.
Oh, that's too bad, son, that's too bad.
Want to eat?
No thanks, uh,
I'm not hungry.
I'll see you again, Tom. So long.
Are you broke?
Yeah.
Then you sit there, and stay there.
There's a here that's broke, give him all he wants.
Everything!
He's over there.
He used to be a great driver.
I'll have some soup and...
A steak and whatever goes with it.
And some coffee.
Is that all, Joe?
Lee.
Joe.
What brought you here?
Looking for you.
Lee, I don't want you to...
Oh, Joe, there's nothing in the world I'd rather do.
Go on... eat.
Everything alright, Joe?
Yeah, alright, Tom.
Well, here it is, Joe.
What there is of it.
We've certainly made a mess of things.
No, we haven't, Joe.
We're gonna start fixing that up right now.
Come on.
Sit down.
You don't know what it means to me to have you back.
I'll never let you go again.
Feel bad?
Would you like a drink?
No.
Aren't you drinking?
Nope.
Since when, Joe?
Oh, you know when.
Since that night at Ascot.
I'm glad, Joe.
Very glad.
I've got something to tell you.
It's about Eddie and Anne.
How're they getting along?
Well, they're very happy together.
Anne's fine.
Eddie too.
He still feels the same way about you.
I don't blame him.
Blame me!
That's what I meant to tell you.
It's about you and Eddie. Your split up.
That was my fault.
I didn't know she would fall in love with him.
But I asked her to take him away from you.
I wanted you to know what it was like to lose someone you love.
You did that?
Yeah.
Oh, well...
It doesn't matter.
Nothing matters.
Nothing matters?
Not even us?
How can it?
We've been flagged off the track.
That isn't true.
You won one fight and I know what it must have cost you.
You said everything ended that night but you're wrong.
Give yourself a chance!
You can still drive.
Drive?
You don't know what you're talking about...
No one in the game trusts me driving a repair truck.
I went down there today.
Asked everybody for a job and they all refused.
Everyone of them!
And they were right!
They know.
Everybody knows.
You know why?
Because I'm through.
I'm chilled off, I'm...
- No, you're not.
- I am!
I've tried, time and time again.
Any race no matter how bad the drivers are it's the same.
I get started with some good laps
And then it happens, every time I'm behind a wheel.
I see that car ahead catch fire.
Like Spud's did.
I did that, that was my fault!
I smell that smoke, that burning, flesh burning.
[Mumbling]
[Band music]
[Engines revving]
They're off!
'There goes Eddie Greer in car number two in to the lead.'
Eddie Greer in car number two has taken the lead
From Billy Arnold in car number four.
Eddie Greer in car number two still in the lead.
'Here we are at the 150th lap.'
'375 miles have been burned up.'
It looks like run away race for
Eddie Greer in car number two.
His nearest competitor,
Arnold in car number four
Is two laps behind.
[Crowd cheering]
Eddie Greer's pit man as just signaled him
That one of his tires is going bad.
It looks as though the tread is working loose.
Apparently however, Greer is afraid to stop and change it
Because a stop now may cost him his lead over car number four.
[Tires screeching]
His arm's in bad shape and it looks like he's out of the race.
And there goes number four!
He's two laps behind and now is his big chance to make it up.
Hey, Ralph, your man hurt?
Looks like it.
Bring him in to the pit next lap.
Is he disqualified?
Not if a substitute driver goes in.
Arnold in car four has taken the lead.
Easy! Careful with that arm.
[Crowd cheering]
'Car number two The Duncan
Martin special is back.'
'With Greer's relief driver taking over.'
Wait a minute, folks!
Here's a surprise.
It's Joe Greer driving.
'And Eddie has gone back in as mechanic.'
Joe Greer car number two still trailing by more than a lap.
Greer is really burning up the track.
He's almost made up half a lap
On car number four and is right behind him.
Just a 100 miles to go, he has good chance making up
The lap that he needs to go into to lead.
[Screeching]
The smoke seems to be bothering Joe
Because he's no longer pressing car number four.
And there goes Joe Greer!
[Crowd cheering]
Whatever was bothering him seems to be forgotten.
Boy, he's really out regain that lap and the lead.
'We're now in our 198th lap'
'And have less than five miles to go.'
Joe and Eddie Greer have regained the lap
When they were behind car number four.
'They're on Arnolds tail and gradually creeping up.'
'But can they make it before the end of the race?'
And here we go in to the last lap.
'They're fighting it off with a terrific burst of speed'
'And the championship will be deiced'
'In the last two and half miles.'
'Joe's pit man just warned him'
'That his right front tire is going bad.'
Tire's bad!
Can't stop now!
Let's take a chance.
'I think the tread is coming off.'
He doesn't dare stop when he is so close
'To the finish.
That tire may go any second.'
'But Joe's pulling up alongside
Arnold and fighting it out!'
'They're neck and neck.
It's anyone's race.'
'I've gotta hand it to Joe Greer.'
'He's doing a lot of swindling driving at this speed'
'With a tire that may blow out at any moment.'
'Look at those cars fly!'
'If they keep up this speed, something is bound to give way.'
'And it'll probably be that tire.'
'Which Joe is gambling on it's lasting till the finish.'
'They're still fighting, neck and neck!'
'Neither seem to be able to lead.'
But can that tire hold out?
'They're nearing the finish line.'
'Looks like they'll finish even.'
'Joe is slowly inching ahead'
'And Arnold doesn't seem to be able to keep the pace.'
That tire can't last longer!
They're into the final stretch.
'Greer leads but watch that tire! There's the flag!'
They're crossing the finish line. Greer wins!
[Crowd cheering]
'There goes Joe's tire!'
[Tires screeching]
[Siren blaring]
Well, kid...
We won.
We won?
You mean, you won.
Gee, Joe, that was the sweetest drivin' I ever saw.
- Nah!
- I mean it!
I guess we're kind of a hard combination to beat, eh, kid?
Oh, how about Arnold and his mechanic?
Oh, they'll be alright.
They're up in the other ambulance, up ahead.
Up ahead?
Arnold...
Hey, driver! Driver, step on it, will ya?
Listen, tell that guy to force them into the curb.
And cut in front on the next turn.
We can pass them on the straightaway. Tell him!
Hey, force them into the curb.
And then cut him out on the next turn. And them pass 'em.
Hey, that's that crazy Joe Greer racing us to the hospital.
Hey driver, get going, will ya?
Beat that guy to the hospital.
I'll have your beds turned down for ya.
So don't come back without it.
All right.
We'll get him when he comes out.
Come on.
What was that?
Sounds like Duke.
That's just why I've got to go
Get back there.
Get out of here.
Take this.
Hurry up, boys, and be careful. with a horse that's gone bad.
Granddaddy. You're not gonna let them kill Duke.
We'll have to abide by the judge's decision. over a poor little horse.
All ready, Your Honor
Oh. what all this ruckus is about.
Uh, I'd like to say a word, judge.
Oh, you must believe me.
Why, yes. He don't seem to bother her.
I'm trying this case.
Miss Ruth, I'd keep away from that horse if I was you.
I am about to pass sentence in this case.
Just a moment, judge.
I'll fine you for contempt of court.
Shut that gate
He's ready to go.
It's a bet,
Henry.
Stay on him!
Foul! He throwed the horse!
He sure knows horse flesh, honey.
All right.
Yes they could, all right.
Because it's a meeting of the vigilantes. of this killer and his gang for good and all?
Maybe he could tell us how to catch a hawk.
We need 'em.
Sit down, old man. Sit down. now's the time to speak up. like to back up his own idea
It's the least we can do for him.
I'll be on hand.
Well, I guess that's about all.
Well, good luck, Drury.
Thank you.
Thanks.
All right. John. if he met up with the Hawk.
Oh, gosh,
I sure love to dance.
Well, why don't you try it sometime?
A birth of a teardrop?
The birth of a smile
When we meet
In the after a while
Do you wonder that we're all afraid of him?
I promise to be on guard.
I don't think it's right.
What on earth is Duke up to now? if I know what
Duke's up to.
Well, Duke, would you like to go Hawk hunting with me
But that settles it.
Don't worry, Ruth,
I won't forget
Bye-bye.
Bye.
All set to go.
Let's go.
We may as well rest here a while.
Whoa
Huh?
Stay here, boy, and cool off.
You won't be needin' a guide much longer. and a dead shot. with a shootin' iron yourself, Sims
You can take care of yourself, all right.
Why, n-no.
Well, that's the kind of shooting I'd like to see.
Come on. Get up.
Go ahead.
Ah. Let's keep back.
Catchin' hawks is out of your line.
You won't have much use for this, I reckon. with old Sol to keep you company.
Well, you're gonna play it all by yourself. food in your saddlebags...
Just a step away.
Adios, amigo.
Oh, here he comes now.
He's inside, boss.
Howdy, boss.
All right.
Saddle up, men.
Come on, boy.
Keep it up, boy.
Come on, Duke.
Oh!
My boy!
Oh, my boy. Jimmy!
But Sims is just the man
I want to see.
All right, Grandpa.
There. Hm?
Looks like a mouth organ.
Heh.
What's this?
"J.D." and scour the desert for John Drury.
Let's go.
Whoa, boys.
Come on.
Stick'em up!
All right, boys, let's get goin'. with you now, Ronald?
Oh.
Bring him over there. till after the trial.
And the prisoner will get every consideration.
Sims?
Heh. It's my duty to stay here and protect this sick man. the court appoints you persecutin' attorney. in plain cow-countryman talk
He sure is. you may proceed.
Hey, here he comes now.
Oh, look.
Who's this comin'?
Get out of sight, men.
Why, uh...
They may be hanging him now.
Let's ride, men. when we were out on the desert.
Objection overruled. unnecessary and extraneous.
Have you got anything furt her to say for yourself?
That's all.
I forgot.
All right, miss. retire to deliberate.
The jury will rise.
And don't spend too much time arguin'. and you can recommend hanging. from hanging an innocent man.
I know John Drury is innocent, judge.
Henry Sims.
I tell you that
Henry Sims is the Hawk
Come on.
Stick'em up.
We got 'em all covered. and I'm takin' company.
Keep back, Gaunt.
Let me go. Stop!
Get in there.
Get around that wall there.
Duke, come on!
And be sure you're slow about doin' it.
Hold 'em now.
All right.
Come on, boys.
Ronald, wail till I-
Aw, Ronald.
Oh, it's the boss.
Take care of him on the inside.
Lock that door.
Let me go.
Make yourself at home for a while. you and I'll be on our way across the border.
Ronald, come on.
Now, now- What-?
I've ever seen.
Hey.
Come on, quick.
Now!
The boss is in trouble.
A little harder, fellas.
Look out,
John!
Stick 'em up!
Get their guns, boys.
Get back there!
Reach for the ceilin' there!
Go ahead.
Aces.
Fine.
Come on, ace. Ah.
Thank goodness for that. I'm done.
Come on, Joe, double or nothing.
Oh, heh. Not me, Nick.
I've paid you double too many times.
Well, faint heart never won fair lady, or fat turkey.
Come on, Joe, what do you say?
Heads or tails?
Uh... I say tails.
I never seen such a lucky stiff.
Better luck next time, Joe.
Well, I guess we got enough money to close up now.
Say, is that my tie?
Why...
When I got up this morning, I sort of...
Yeah, well, why didn't you put on that new checkered suit of mine...
...while you were about it?
- Heh-heh-heh.
It didn't fit.
- Hey, Nick.
- Yeah?
Who do you like in the last race at Louisville?
Well, I got my dough on Abie Kabbible.
- You think he'll win?
- Why, sure he'll win.
Nothing else, he'll win by a nose.
- Smart fella, this boy.
- I'm looking for action tonight myself.
- Well, don't worry, boy, you'll get it.
Everything all right?
Mr. Nick, there's a lady outside what wants to see you.
How do you know she's a lady,
Snake Eyes?
Heh. Well, boss, she's got a skirt on.
- All right, I'll see her.
- Don't forget to remember, boss.
Lucky with the cards, unlucky with the love.
That's a lot of bunkaroo.
Don't you forget to remember...
- Little Nick is lucky with the women too.
I don't know.
- Sometime, you'll pick the wrong filly.
- Not a chance.
Nothing but favorites in my stable.
My lady, here I come.
- Oh, hello, baby.
- Hello, Nick.
What's the matter?
I've got to have some money right away, Nick.
Well, what's up?
Hmm?
Yeah?
Hmm.
- How much do you need?
- I've got to have a hundred dollars.
Well, you know Nick.
I never go back on my word, sister.
Thank you, Nick. I wouldn't have asked you for it if I didn't have to have it.
Sure, I know. I know you wouldn't.
- Gee, you're a swell fellow.
- Well, I'm glad to do it, baby. Glad to do it.
I've gotta be going now, Nick.
- Bye.
- So long.
Hmm.
Oh, back so soon, eh? Well?
- What's the matter?
- A dame wanting me to step out with her.
I've got holes in my socks from kicking skirts away.
Let's see what the boys in the backroom have got to offer.
I'll be right in.
Uh... Running into house and lot.
Who'll give me half a dollar for my hand?
I wouldn't give you a nickel for your whole body.
Oh, Mr. Nick.
- Let's see you do it.
- Come, dice. Hah!
Eight's the point.
A dollar I comes, Mr. Nick.
Bet. Bet it is.
Half a cigar, he shoots.
- Hah!
- Six and he wants eight.
- Eight from Decatur. Hah.
Ha-ha.
Read them and weep.
Seven and you're through.
- Up pops the devil.
Ha-ha-ha.
Tough luck.
- Mr. Nick.
- Yeah?
You sure is one lucky white man.
You got carfare home, Snake Eyes?
No, sir, I ain't, boss.
I ain't got a red cent.
Then here, take this fin.
Stay out of this game from now on.
Yes, sir.
Don't you kid yourself.
He had you on the run...
- Come on, come on, who shoots next?
- Your dice.
Come on, your dice, man.
All right, get your money ready, Nick.
- Hey, let me in here.
Hey, what are you doing, kibitzing the game?
No, I got dough.
Well, we're not taking any two-bit bets tonight, Sport.
Well, I'm not making any two-bit bets tonight.
Whew.
- That look like two bits to you?
This is big-time.
Hmm.
- All right.
- I'll shoot 10 of that.
- Shoot all or nothing.
- What are you talking about?
- You'll shoot the C-note or nothing.
- You can't tell me...
You heard me, the hundred or nothing.
Shoot the piece.
This is big game now.
- Get up and leave. The dough is piling up.
- Come on.
Three and two. Point is five.
- Six, and he wants five.
- Uh-oh.
Go on.
- Seven, makes him a loser.
- Heh.
And the prisoner ate a hearty breakfast.
- Well, that cleans me.
- Well, come on, move along.
- What the...?
- Come on, breeze.
And as you go out that door, take that "welcome" sign off it.
Hey, boss, what do you got against this Sport?
- I don't like the way he parts his hair.
Ha-ha-ha.
- Who shoots next?
- You're too tough for me.
- It's not for us.
- I don't want any.
Nick, you're wasting your time in a small tank like this.
You should be in that big game in the city.
Why, Hickory Short would be a cinch for you.
- You ain't kidding me, are you?
- I'm on the level.
Yes.
This town's getting soft for me.
How much would it take to buck that game?
Well, a fella shouldn't try to unless he had at least $ 10,000.
Whew.
That's a lot of dough.
Ooh.
- Ten thousand bucks.
I'll have that someday.
And when I do,
I'll show those city birds something.
Say, listen, why don't we make up a pool and stake Nick to that big game?
- I'll go for a little of it.
- You mean that, kid?
Sure, you can have all I got.
That's a great idea.
I could raise 5000 on the barbershop.
I put in $ 1000, what I was gonna send back for my wife to bring her here.
Oh, no, no, no, don't do that. Ha-ha.
Well, look, maybe I'm better off if I don't send it so I can't lose nothing anyhow.
I'll put in a hundred.
Count me in.
I'll put in 200.
You can have all I've got.
I'll back you anytime.
We're all with you.
Right.
Blondie, what do say about us two going to the big city, huh?
Boys, you're on.
Attaboy, Nicky, you'll knock them for a loop.
- Here, Mr. Nick, I'll put in $5.
- Oh, no...
Oh.
We can't lose now.
Too much from a guy now, will you?
- Not too.
- Goodbye.
- Bye, write me a letter and get fat, will you?
Okay.
Just keep that in your pocket, Mr. Nick, and you'll win for sure.
Oh, thanks, Snake Eyes.
Say, I've practically got that big city sugar in my kick right now.
Come here, give me luck.
Here, Nick, here's my home office address.
You can send my share there.
- I'll send you back your grand and your cut.
Okay.
You all understand, I pay back your original investment and we split the winnings 50-50.
That's right.
How much you think you're gonna win?
I'll win so much, you can send back to the old country...
...for your wife and your sweetheart too.
Well, now, look here, young squirt, you keep that barbershop going.
Sorry to see you go, Nick.
Well, soon as I make my killing,
I'll send for you, and that won't be long.
- Here's your ride.
- I'll be waiting.
- Well.
- Good luck with those big-city blonds.
Yeah, well, this is the only blond that I'm true to.
Goodbye.
Say, conductor, what time do we get to the big city?
We're due in there at 6:42.
And we've never been late yet.
Well, I bet you 10-to-5 we don't make it.
Nice ride. Thanks.
Telegram for Mr. L.S. Johnson.
Mr. L.S. Johnson, please.
Telegram for Mr. L.S. Johnson.
Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Everything satisfactory, Mr. Venizelos?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
Fine hotel you got here.
Where's the barbershop?
- It's right downstairs, sir.
- Oh, thanks.
Oh, by the way, you haven't seen
Hickory Short around here today, have you?
You mean Hickory Short, the gambler?
- Yeah.
- He doesn't live here.
I heard he hung out here.
Well, not in this hotel.
Hmm.
Say, you don't happen to know in which room the big roving poker game...
...is going on tonight, do you?
No, sir, I don't. We don't permit anything like that around this hotel.
Oh, I see.
Thanks. Heh-heh.
Huh.
Whew.
Hmm.
Heh.
Oh, uh...
I'd like a heater, miss.
- Heater?
- Yeah, a cigar.
I've never heard them called that before.
Any particular brand?
Oh, about two bits or better, if you got them.
These are very nice.
I can recommend them.
You smoke them yourself?
Oh, no, sir.
Well, they are good. Hmm.
Look awfully good.
I'll take four or five of these.
- How much are they?
- They're a dollar apiece.
You think so?
Well, that's the price.
All right. Ahem.
I'll take them.
Here you are, lady.
- Thank you.
- Keep the change.
Say, what are these things for?
Poker dice.
Oh, you gamble with them?
Yes, sir, it's a dollar if you lose.
If you win, you get $2 worth of merchandise.
Anything behind the counter?
Anything in merchandise.
Heh-heh.
Well, you're a cute little package.
Would you like to roll the dice?
Well, I don't know.
I'm a little green at this sort of thing.
Poker dice, one flop.
- All right.
- Here goes.
- Hard to beat, lady. Heh-heh-heh.
- Not for me.
- Well, come on, let's see you do it.
- Here goes.
I'm for you. There you go.
Two fours.
- Three fours, one on me.
- Ha-ha-ha.
Well, here goes again.
Make it easy for you this time.
Pair of fives. That's a cinch.
- I'd beat it with my eyes closed.
- I bet you can too.
- Come on, let's see you do it. Ha-ha-ha.
- Here goes.
Oh, two fours.
- Well, I'm sorry. Sorry, lady.
- Two on me.
Ha-ha.
Say, you're a cute little trick.
Anybody ever tell you that?
Not yet.
Oh.
Well, here goes again.
Well, better still, straight six high.
- Beat that.
- You must have beginner's luck.
- But I'll beat it even yet.
- Come on, let's see you do it. Come on.
- There's a straight.
- I'm sorry, baby, but you lose.
Five high, mine was six high.
Say, look here. You better quit this.
I hate to see a nice little girl like you lose her job.
Thanks.
That's three games on the house.
My, but you're lucky.
Do you gamble much?
Oh, I take a little flyer every once in a while.
For big money?
Do I look like a tinhorn?
- I should say not.
- Heh-heh-heh.
Well, how much do I owe you?
Three dollars, and you get $6 worth of merchandise.
What will you have?
I got my eye on that big box of candy right there.
- That's just $6.
- Well, I'll have it.
- Shall I wrap it up for you?
- No, no, no. You keep it, baby.
Oh, I don't think I can do that. I mean...
No, that's all right. I don't eat candy.
Gets in my teeth.
Well, that's too bad for you.
- Yeah.
- But my good luck.
Look here...
You know, I'm a stranger in town.
How'd you like to come out and have dinner with me tonight?
Oh, I couldn't. My mother doesn't let me stay out at night.
Oh, that's too bad.
- Are you sure you won't change your mind?
- Oh, I couldn't. I really couldn't.
I'm glad you like it here.
It's very good, let me tell you that.
- Really?
- Yeah.
It's one of the best seafood places
I've ever been at. Ahem.
- I thought you'd like it.
- Great java too.
Mmm.
Not a bad cigar you sold me.
I always say you can tell a gentleman by the kind of cigar he smokes.
Of course, at home,
I smoke my own brand.
- Yeah?
- A fellow in Havana makes them up for me.
- You don't say.
- Hmm.
Say, Marie, you know most of the regulars that hang around the hotel, don't you?
Well, yes. Why?
Well, ever see Hickory Short around?
You know, the big gambler.
Well, he's an awfully nice fellow.
He's around all the time.
You don't happen to know which room they're holding the game?
I happen to know.
You won't say I told you.
Not a word. Come on, tell me, sister.
Mr. Short ordered some cigars to be sent up to his room this afternoon.
- Yeah?
- And it's 346.
Boy, am I itching to get in that game.
Ho-ho-ho-ho.
I hope you don't think I'm butting in,
Mr. Venizelos.
Call me Nick.
All right, Nick.
Attagirl. Heh-heh. Say, we getting along swell, aren't we? Heh.
- What is it you're gonna say, baby?
- You've been so nice to me and all.
I was just going to suggest that you put some money in the hotel safe.
- Yeah?
- For carfare home, in case you...
There won't be any in case, sister.
I hope not.
All right, I got an idea.
Here.
Now, you keep this for me.
- A hundred dollars? Why, I couldn't.
- Yeah.
You keep this for me, baby.
After the game, I'll make you a present of it. And if I lose... Heh.
Gee, it sounds funny to hear myself saying "lose. "
Well, if I should lose,
I'll need it for cigar money.
But you don't know me,
I might run away with it.
Now, listen, sister, I'm a gambler.
It's my business to read human nature, to know people.
- And I can tell that you're on the level.
- But you could put it in the hotel safe.
Oh, no. You're safe enough for me, baby.
Well, all right, if you insist.
Attagirl. Come on, put it in the sock.
Heh-heh.
Uh...
I'd like to see Hickory Short.
Well, I'm Hickory Short.
Yeah?
Well, I'm Nick Venizelos from Irontown.
- Nick the Barber, they call me.
- Oh.
- Come in, Mr. Venizelos.
- Thanks.
I've often heard of you.
Yeah? Heh-heh.
Well...
Have you any way of identifying yourself?
Why, yes, I...
Gee, I forgot my badge.
Yeah.
Here.
- Mm-hm. Yeah.
- "Nick Venizelos. "
- Well?
- You didn't miss many of them, did you?
Well, here's the convincer.
- That's me in the middle.
- Hmm.
Well, I guess you're yourself, all right.
I'm glad to meet you after all the stories
I've heard about your luck, Mr. Venizelos.
- Oh, call me Nick.
- Hmm.
- All right, Nick.
- Attaboy, Hick. Heh.
You know, I've been wanting to meet you for a long time.
- For a little action? Heh-heh.
- How'd you guess?
Come on over.
I want you to meet some of the boys.
- Sure.
- King's high.
Boys, I want you to meet Mr. Venizelos.
Ahem.
- Mr. Tompkins.
- Honest John Tompkins?
- That's me.
- Oh, glad to know you, John.
- Mr. River.
- Old Deep River himself, eh?
In person. Not a motion picture, Nick.
Heh-heh-heh.
- Mr. Shultz.
- Back-to-Back Shultz.
You're the fella that almost broke the bank at Monte Carlo.
- Guilty. Glad to know you, Nick.
- Well, I'm glad to know you, Shultz.
And Mr. Barnes.
- I don't like them from the bottom, brother.
- All right, Nick.
I'll make an exception in your case.
- Hello.
- Have some grape, Nick?
Well, thanks, I don't much mind if I do. Yeah.
Hmm.
Ahhh. Mm-hm.
Fizz water, huh? Heh-heh.
Very good, Hickory. Where'd you get it?
I'd like to get a case.
I'll send you around a case tomorrow.
Well, maybe I'll be better able to pay for it tomorrow.
- Well, I'll send it to you anyhow.
- Hmm.
Well, what are we waiting for?
How about a little game of skill and chance?
Well, I've heard of such things.
What do you like to play?
Five-card stud. How does that suit you?
- What's the limit?
- The roof.
Fine.
Now, Nick, we're all friends here.
Of course, we ain't playing marbles, but we don't want no arguments.
- Anything ain't right, you just say so.
- Right.
- Waiter?
Yes, sir.
Bring a half a dozen new decks of cards.
Regular backs. Hmm?
- Oh.
- Well, go on, stupid.
- Anything the guest wants.
- Heh-heh-heh.
Yes, sir.
- What's the matter? Ain't those cards good?
- Oh, sure.
Just an old barbershop custom.
A fresh towel with every shave is my motto.
Here, give me 5 G.
All right, Nick.
Four there?
If you run out of those, there's more where they come from.
Brother, before the night's over, you'll be buying them from me.
- Well, you're an optimist anyhow.
- That's the way to be, Nick.
Say, what are these yellows?
Thousands?
- Yes.
- What are the blues?
Blues are hundreds.
I'll call.
- All right, boys?
- Come on, ace me, big boy.
Well, a pair of aces.
Looks like you made them, Nick.
A seven.
- I didn't do too well.
Six is a pair.
And a little deuce, a pair of aces.
Bet they're high.
Well, that cleans me out, boys.
Looks like I'm on my way to the cleaners too.
- Never say die.
- I'll call.
- Raise you.
- I'm out.
Well, that'll have to be a side bet.
Well, I'll call. Pair of aces with a queen.
I think I got you, Hickory.
Aces, king next.
- Yes, you're right.
- Thanks, gentlemen.
- Jacks and sixes.
- Whew.
- What a pot.
- Old Back-to-Back Shultz.
Ah.
Well, Nick, the luck's certainly running against you tonight.
Yeah. Oh, it's just a matter of the breaks. Heh-heh.
Don't worry about me, boys.
My brother works in the mint.
- Good morning, Mr. Venizelos.
- Good morning.
"Knocked them dead. " Hmm.
Hey, what's that?
I don't know, but it's plenty heavy.
- Hmm.
- Is that all, sir?
Yeah, that's all.
Here, take that.
Gee, thank you.
Thank you ever so much.
Say, girlie, where's Marie?
Marie? Oh, you mean the girl that worked here?
- Yeah.
- I don't know, sir.
I just got a call to report here this morning.
Oh.
I see.
Hmm.
You don't mind if I put my hat on top of yours?
- It's all right, sir.
- All right.
What's the idea, young man?
Give me my paper back. Oh.
I like your nerve, you...
Well, well, if it isn't Nick.
Well, it ain't his sister.
I'm awfully glad to see you.
I didn't think you'd get out of that other game.
Hickory, that was nice of you to send me that fizz water.
Don't mention it. Pleasure's mine.
- How are you?
- Hello, Nick.
- Hi, pal.
- Glad to see you.
You locate some fresh money, Nick?
Heh-heh.
Well, I told you, my brother works in the mint.
You know, it ain't so tough when you got friends.
Come on, sit in, Nick.
You can't get even standing up.
I'm glad you got out of that other game.
You'd be better company.
Sit in, Nick, the water's fine.
They're taking me tonight.
Well, do you think you can afford it, big boy?
Can he afford it?
Oh, you ain't got any chips yet, Nick.
- I'll take 3000.
Right.
No use holding up the deal.
That's all right, plenty of time.
Don't be in a hurry.
There they are, Nick, the same values as yesterday.
- Mm.
- King bets 50.
Come again, Shultzy, 50 more.
Call.
You're too tough for me, boys.
Fight it out.
- I scram.
- And 50 more to you.
- I stay.
- Call.
Coming up.
King, six, nine, the eight.
- The king, six is high. You bet, Shultz.
Check.
Well, you can't have anything in check.
Heh-heh.
I bet a blue.
- I'll call it.
Make it three.
All right, I'll stay.
Stay.
Coming up, you caught a five.
You caught the ace, you caught the other ace.
Ace, jack is high. Your bet.
Well, I'll check to the raise.
Bet a half a yellow.
Well, how about making it a full yellow, just for good luck, eh?
- That's okay.
- I'll see it.
Call.
Here's the card that tells the story.
You caught a nine.
The ace, king, the 10.
The ace, king is high. Your bet, Nick.
Well, ace, king bets five blues.
- Well, I'll make it a yellow.
- Call.
Well, I got so much confidence in my hand,
I'll tap myself for a yellow and red.
All right, I'll call it.
- Shultz is calling.
- Call.
Kings are good, I guess.
Not with me. Pair of aces.
Well, I think I top you, Hickory.
Aces, king next.
You win. Looks like your lucky day.
- Whew. Oh, boy.
That's the works. Sweet pot.
This Nick the Barber's just a gambling fool.
And here you are, Barnes.
Here's my 3000 back. I'll play these.
You keep these, Nick.
Keep them, pay for them.
You ain't got enough velvet to see yourself through a bad hand.
- That's all right. If I need them, I'll buy.
- Well, buy them now.
Well, why buy when I already got some?
See, I got enough here to see me through a long way.
Well, that ain't the idea.
You come here, sit in cold, you sit in without any dough...
- What do you mean without any dough?
- I know you got dough.
Well, what then?
Well, it just ain't being done. You cash in your chips when you're through.
Oh, what's the difference, Hickory?
It's my game. It's gonna be played according to house rules.
All right, then.
Here, pay me off. I blew another game to come up here tonight.
We ain't running any credit game.
You ain't in Irontown now.
- Let's see your dough.
- You saw my dough yesterday, 10 grand.
- Yeah? Well, yesterday was another day.
- Well, pay me off.
You trying to pull a fast one?
Who do you think you're playing with, a lot of chumps?
- Come, show him your dough.
- I don't show you nothing.
You cheap bunch of chiselers.
I know who you are. Hickory Short, huh?
Didn't take you long to get out of that can.
- How have you been, Sleepy Sam?
Ha-ha-ha.
Yeah, and Two-Time Phil.
- Well, what about it?
- You guys ain't gamblers. You're burglars.
How'd you like to show your racket to the police?
Why, you smalltime squealer, you tinhorn from the sticks...
- Ah-ah-ah. Do I get my dough?
- You get nothing.
- Well, I'll show you.
Come here.
Get back...
Well, hello, baby.
You must have the wrong apartment.
Why, you remember me.
You remember, I gave you that hundred bucks to keep for me.
I never saw you before.
Say, what is this?
It's the big city, Hiram.
Scram.
Yah!
Open that door.
I thought so.
Why, you're a shelf for those burglars.
Stole the money that belonged to my friends.
Come on, open that door.
All right. If that's the way you play the game in this town, I'll play it the same way.
Only I'll play it in spades.
That means you'll pay double.
Why, you hustling little bag.
I'll have you begging for a cup of coffee.
And as for that dope of yours,
I'll run him right into the lake.
What's the noise all about, monkey?
- What's it to you?
- Nothing.
- Oh, thank you.
- Oh, how are you, Mr. Amenoppopolus?
Step right in. Well...
- How about a shave today?
- Nice to see you. And you shall have it.
Well, nice to see you again.
I haven't seen you in some time now.
Where do you get your...?
Oh, excuse me just a minute. Ahem.
Well, did you get the job, boy?
Nope. Just missed out on it.
Which makes it an even eight.
I told you not to come here until I had dough to send for you.
Yeah, I know, but I couldn't stand that small burg any longer, Nick, after you left.
You know how it is.
Well, it'll be all right. You'll find a job.
- Had any lunch?
- Heh.
Not today.
Then here's 2 bucks.
Now, put this on Flying Feet in that third race at Churchill Downs.
And here's two bits for your lunch.
Now go on and put on the feed bag.
Thanks, Nick.
Pardon me, Mr. Amenoppopolus, but I had to speak to an old friend of mine.
- It's all right, Nick.
- Thanks.
- Once over, same as usual?
- Yeah.
- All right.
- Don't shave it too close, Nick.
My face is very tender today.
I'll take care of that.
- Nice weather we're having.
- Mm-hm.
Great for the races.
Yeah, I'm glad it isn't raining.
The track is gliding fast, Nick.
Heh-heh. Oh, well, that doesn't make any difference to me.
Say, I can pick mudders just as easily as fair weather horses anytime.
- You little wizard. By the way...
- Yeah?
Who do you like in the fifth race at Louisville?
I got a little bet on No Regrets.
Before I forget, shoot this for me in the game tonight.
Right. Heh-heh-heh.
How've you been doing lately?
I've been doing swell,
Mr. Amenoppopolus.
The boys in the shop have been staking me to the club game.
And I won quite a lot of jack for them, and a little bit for myself.
They've been making a pool for you, huh?
Yeah, that's the idea, but that's just bush-league money.
Oh, if I have some really important dough...
...I could get into that big game where the sugar is sweet.
Why, how much would it take to get into that big game?
Oh, about 10 grand.
- Ten thousand, huh?
- Yeah, 10,000, Mr. Amenoppopolus.
And what I know now about the racket...
...I could trim them plenty.
Heh-heh-heh.
I tell you, Peter, he is the luckiest man in the world.
- Ha-ha.
- How do you know it, Alex?
How do I know?
- I've been staking him in a small way.
- Yeah.
And he won for me every time.
- Haven't I though, huh? Ha-ha-ha.
- Sure.
Now, if we can put him in the big game,
I'm sure we can win big money.
Boy. Ha-ha.
Well, I tell you, Alex, if it's good enough for you, it's good enough for me...
...for to take a chance.
- I'm not a gambling man, you know that.
- Yeah?
But you can count on me for 3000.
- Oh, boy.
- How's that?
Oh, thanks, Pete.
You won't regret it, I tell you.
My luck is running great these days.
Fine. I'll get the cash and send it over.
- Thanks.
- Let's step across the street...
...and see Mr. Dondolos and his four brothers.
They usually like a little sport.
Yes, and let's not forget Mr. Agranopolis.
- No. Sure.
- We mustn't hurt his feelings.
- Can't I put more money in?
- No, you've put in enough, boy.
You'll be getting plenty.
You'll be backing up that truck of yours at the bank every day.
- You watch it. That's great.
- Thanks, Pete.
- Goodbye, I appreciate it. Goodbye.
- Good luck.
If you don't mind, I'd like to return these.
The boy brought me more than I needed.
- All right, do you want the cash for them?
- Lf you please.
- Here you are, sir.
- Thank you.
Buy yourself a cigar.
Thank you.
Penthouse.
That was a nifty girl you had last night.
She wasn't bad, was she?
I think she's not very good either.
Follow me.
You'll find I don't do so bad either.
You're a regular sheik, aren't you?
Not bad out here, boy.
You think she had a sister?
I think it's the mustache.
What's wrong with this place?
Who is it?
It's only me, Sam. Nick the Barber.
Well, Nick, hello, how are you?
Hello, hello.
How are you, Nick?
- My name is Nick Venizelos, what's yours?
- Simpson, how are you?
Glad to know you.
Well, I haven't seen you in six months.
It's taken me that long to catch up with you.
Go on, play your hand out.
Oh, yeah.
Will anybody open?
It's up to you, Sam.
Well, I can't do anything with these.
- I pass.
It's by me.
You looking prosperous, Nick.
Hey, now listen, you mugs, no use chicken-scratching around.
I got something to say to you, especially to you.
Sit down.
I've had some time to think things over.
I'm gonna be a real sucker.
I'm looking for evens.
You haven't any objections, have you, Sam?
No, no. Sure, I'll play with you, Nick.
Good.
And you can see my dough this time.
Oh, you're all right with me, Nick.
I suppose I always was, huh?
Now, listen, I got 50,000 bucks with me.
Fifty thousand.
And I'll play you freeze out for the whole amount, pay after each hand.
All right.
Whew. That's a lot of dough.
Not for Nick.
That brother of mine owns the mint now.
And I'll give you a break.
I'll play at your best game.
I'll play you poker, stud or draw,
Clobyosh, rummy, high or low...
...pinochle, I'll even cut your high cards.
Name your weapons. Here, suntan.
Go downstairs and get a half a dozen new decks.
- Yeah...
- Go on, stupid.
Anything the guest wants.
Yes, sir.
You're still superstitious, huh?
No, just careful.
Come on, Sam, get set.
Just you and me. We'll deal our own.
You boys get to the sidelines.
You don't mind if I take a peek of his play?
I don't care what you do.
I'm just playing Sam.
Count me in, Sam.
All right.
Save your chips and we'll cash in later.
If you don't mind, let's see your dough.
I think I can match you, all right.
- Cards.
- Two.
One for me.
What do you do?
Well, I can't bet in to a one-card draw.
How much money have you got left?
Five C's.
Well, you better put them in the center, because that's just what I'm going to bet.
Five C's.
Well, I've got to call you.
All blue.
Well, they're good, and I'm clean.
I guess that's all. Hmm?
It is, as far as I'm concerned.
Sorry, Sleepy, tough luck.
Can't say that you got the breaks.
Gee, I wish those tailors would make these pockets a little bigger.
Well, Barnes, and you had to cut in on his share.
Yeah.
Heh-heh. Not so smart, huh?
Yeah.
Suntan, my hat, my cane, my gloves.
I heard that in a play once.
Oh.
Here.
- Go with that as far as it'll take you.
- Thank you, sir.
Well, Nick the Barber gave you a trimming, huh?
Well, I'll be seeing you, boys.
- Just a minute.
- Wait a minute, Nick.
Behave.
How do you like it, boys?
What are you singing the blues about?
I told you I was gonna get evens, and I told you I was gonna play your way.
Of course, you smart gamblers have heard of shaved cards.
Well, Nick the Barber can shave them a little closer than you can.
Just take a look at those decks
I sent out for.
Well, goodbye, boys.
And thanks for the buggy ride.
A weak knee you turned out to be.
- I had to take half of a dumb like that.
- Mug like that take you.
- Pipe down, you. You make me sick.
What kind of a mug are you?
Say, the smoke bother you?
- Oh, no, I like it.
- A little late to ask you, huh?
You know, a fellow in Havana makes them up for me.
- You don't say.
- Yeah.
Now, be yourself.
I suppose you're very happy this morning,
Mr. Venizelos.
Yeah, why?
I read in the papers about you winning a lot of money from that gambler.
Um, Sleepy Sam,
I think that was his name.
Yeah. Oh, that was nothing.
I'm just starting.
Before long, you'll be reading a whole lot about me.
My, it must be wonderful to win a lot of money like that.
Ooh. Money don't mean anything to me.
Say, you're a pretty smart girl.
Maybe you can give me a little advice.
Now, if you were a man...
...and a certain girl had made a sucker out of you...
Heh.
...once upon a time, how would you get even with her?
- Well...
- I don't mean hurt her or anything like that.
But just make her change her mind about me being a sucker.
Oh, why, you're only kidding,
Mr. Venizelos.
How could anybody play you for a sucker?
No, no, no, I'm not kidding.
I'm serious, sister.
I'd just like to get a little satisfaction out of that young lady.
Now, how would you go about it?
- Well, if I were a man...
- Yeah?
The first thing I would do would be send her some flowers.
- Mm-hm.
- Then I'd follow it up with a bracelet.
Then if she's that kind of a girl, well, the rest is easy.
Bracelet?
So you mean one of those things they wear around their wrists?
Yes, with diamonds in it.
Diamonds?
Mm-hm.
You're not this girl's manager, are you?
Hmm.
Oh, here you are, Marie.
Take care of Blondie.
Just let me know anything I can do for you, sir.
All right.
I want you to open that door to that next room.
And put these first two suitcases in there.
Yes, sir.
- Here, George.
- Thank you, sir.
But, boss, I can't spend no half a bill.
You'll get the other half at the other end of the line...
...if you're a good boy.
Yes, sir. I won't be good, I'll be perfect.
Come here, give me luck.
Yes, sir. You sure have luck now.
Oh, George, what room is Mr. Short in?
- Mr. Short...
- Yeah, Hickory Short.
Oh, he's in 3-A, sir.
- All right, scram.
- Yes, sir.
Marie, open the suitcase and hang up my checkered suit.
Well, boy, this is the payoff.
I wish the crowd back in the old barbershop could see us now.
Louisville bound with a bank roll big enough to choke a cow.
I guess after tonight,
I'll send the boys back home a few thou.
You've already paid them double.
What of it? I got plenty.
Besides, ain't they still my pals? Heh-heh.
Neck to neck, Nick.
Make every post a winning one.
If I lose,
I'll be back in the old barbershop...
...matching pennies with Snake Eyes.
- Heh-heh.
But how can I lose? Heh-heh.
- Good evening, boys.
- Good evening, boss.
Here, try these.
A fellow in Havana makes them up for me.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
Hello, Nick.
- Oh, hello, Tom.
Say, can you let me have another key for a friend of mine?
Who for? The district attorney?
No, chief of police.
Oh, in that case, you can have mine.
Great. Thanks.
Good evening. How are you?
- Good evening.
Good evening.
May I have your hat and coat?
I'll give it to you this time.
- How are they treating you?
- Just fine.
- Say, you're new here, aren't you?
- Yes.
- Oh, you'll like it. Heh-heh.
- Thank you.
- You know who I am?
- Yes, sir.
Oh, uh...
- Straighten that painting.
- Yes, sir.
Mm. Not bad.
Oh, Nick. Nick, look what I've won.
My luck finally changed.
- I just can't seem to lose.
- No?
- How much did you win?
- A hundred and 10 dollars.
Here, let me see.
Twenty, 40, 60, 80, 90, a hundred.
Great. Just what you owe me.
- What I owe you?
- Yeah.
You never did have a good memory.
Here.
Why, Nick. What do you mean?
Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen.
How are you doing now, baby?
Great. I've been playing the red.
Here's a hundred, put that on the red too.
Oh, Nick.
- You darling.
- Ha-ha-ha.
All down?
All down.
Attagirl. Heh-heh.
What are we gonna do about it?
Every time we raid Nick, he proves he doesn't own the place.
He's got a phony front for every one of his joints. And you can't pin anything on him.
That isn't a suggestion. That's an alibi.
We close him one night and he opens up the next in another spot.
Another alibi.
Now, I demand a showdown.
With election coming up...
...I'm not going to let a tinhorn gambler put me in the middle.
We found Sleepy Sam, chief.
He got in from Frisco last week.
- Where is he?
- In there.
Boys, I'd like to see him alone.
- Sam?
- How are you, DA?
Just step into my office.
- Anything new on that case?
- Something hot.
- I'll talk to you later.
- All right.
Glad to see you, Sam.
How have you been?
What's up, Black?
I just want to get some gambling information from you, Sam.
Yeah?
Well, three of a kind still beat two pair.
Don't be a comedian.
I don't know anything about it.
I've been legit for months.
- What made you quit?
- I got tired of it. What's it to you?
Yes, you got tired of it after Nick the Barber pushed you over and rubbed it in.
I understand he took your girl too.
If you know so much, what did you send for me for?
Listen, Sam.
We're both holding the same bag.
This little greaseball, Nick, is giving us both the runaround.
Why don't you come clean?
Tell me how to bring him down.
If I knew, I'd do it myself.
He must have some weakness.
He's just a smalltime hick at heart.
But just dumb enough to be smart.
If you were the district attorney, how would you tackle him?
I'd shoot him some night when he was trying to escape from the law.
Don't be silly. That isn't done.
- Well, you know his weakness, don't you?
- What?
Heh.
He's nuts for blonds. Yeah.
Send your wife around, he'll go for any old bag.
Why, you... Grr.
A little rub, Nick?
- Yeah, I don't mind.
Now, what is it you boys wanna know?
We want to know what you've got to say to this latest blast from the district attorney.
Oh, has he been talking about me?
Look at that.
He's throwing kisses at you again.
Why, he's got me all wrong, boys.
I'm not a gambler, I'm a barber.
This is my shop.
This is the only business I've got.
Nick the Barber, isn't that what everybody calls me?
What's he wanna go ahead and make a lot of trouble for?
I'm just a nice little fella trying to get along.
What's he wanna go ahead and blow a lot of steam off for?
You know, he reminds me of a little sawmill we had in our old hometown in Irontown.
It had a big whistle, every time the whistle blew...
...the sawmill stopped running.
Yeah.
Then you're going to keep your place open as usual?
Well, why not? There's no law against running a barbershop, is there?
You're too smart for one guy, Nick.
- Yeah, I ought to incorporate, huh?
Yeah.
Here, have a cigar, boys.
A fella in Havana makes them up for me.
- Is that so?
- Help yourselves.
- Sure.
- I'm not forgetting you, old boy.
- Well, so long.
- So long.
See you in the jailhouse.
Sure, I'll come and visit you in the can anytime, brother.
So long.
So long.
Good luck, Nick.
I gotta catch this next edition, Nick.
Thanks very much.
Well, pleasure was all mine, boys.
Heh-heh.
Boss, you're sure one smart fellow.
- You sure tell them a big mouthful.
- Yeah.
If that cheap district attorney get too fresh...
...Nick the Barber give him close shave.
Place your bets.
Now, don't be jealous, pal.
Oh.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
- Are you Mr. Venizelos?
- Well, you've got the right fellow.
- Sit down, please.
- Thank you.
- I wonder, Mr. Venizelos, if you could...
- Oh, call me Nick.
- Well, I'm in an awful plight.
- Yeah?
I've lost all my money at the roulette table.
And I wonder if you could lend me some to get home on.
I don't believe in lending, but I'll give you 10.
Ten? Oh, I need 500.
Five hundred?
Where do you live, lady? China?
Oh.
I could leave this for security.
Hmm. You can't go wrong on that.
- It's worth nearly a thousand.
- You know jewelry, all right.
And women too.
You know, it's my business to make a study of human nature.
And I can see that you're on the level.
I've heard how fascinating you are to women, Mr. Venizelos...
...but the stories only half told it.
Hmm. Heh-heh-heh.
Well, I think that deserves a drink, don't you?
- How about it?
- Fine.
Thank you.
Here's to the most charming man
I've ever met.
And here's to the most charming woman
I've ever met.
- Ahh.
- You're certainly a friend in need.
Big-hearted Nick, they call me.
Never said no to a woman in my life.
I'll take you to the cashier's and get the money. Oh, don't let's forget this.
There.
Tell me, when am I gonna see you again?
When would you like to?
Tomorrow for lunch, at the Savoy?
Yes, that would be splendid.
You give me your address,
I'll send my car for you.
No, thanks.
Never mind, I'll just take a taxi.
Oh, no, no, no. I wouldn't think of you doing that. Ha-ha-ha.
Oh, that's all right.
I'll meet you there, Nick.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
And tell the district attorney
I'll see him on Tuesday.
Hello? Hello?
Say, get me the district attorney...
...at his home right away.
I'll answer it.
- Hello?
- Hello, is that you, Black?
Well, this is Nick the Barber.
I just kicked your stool pigeon right out of my office.
If you don't quit messing around my affairs,
I'm gonna kick you right out of town.
A stool pigeon?
What did she do to tip her mitt?
Oh, boy, I can tell them.
She had "district attorney" written right across her kisser.
Before I got through with her, she had
Nick the Barber written across her...
...something else.
- Heh-heh.
- Congratulations.
- Yeah.
You got wise to yourself at last.
No woman will ever make a sucker out of me again.
Nick is plenty smart these days. Yes, sir.
- Oh, boy. Ha-ha.
- Heh-heh.
Boy, I'll never forgot the expression on that dame's pan...
...when I gave her the boot.
Probably the first time she was kicked out of an office.
Yeah.
What's that?
Stop, Bill.
- What's the matter?
- We dragged a girl out.
- Will you take her?
- Where is she?
- Right over there.
- Go on, let's see.
Still alive?
Yes.
Get a robe, quick.
Yes, sir.
We'll take her to the hospital.
Wait a minute, what do you know about this dame?
Well, all I know she's almost drowned.
Come on. Quickly, get her in the car.
Get her in the car now.
I'll take care of her.
- All right, George, pick up.
Attaboy.
- All right.
- Go on, step on it.
How do you know she's not another plant from the DA's office?
I suppose they brought her here and threw her in the water.
Well, don't forget, you can still pour water.
Smart fella, aren't you?
Here.
Attagirl.
- Where am I?
- You're all right.
- We're taking you to the hospital.
- Where?
To the Receiving Hospital.
Now, don't get excited.
Oh, please don't take me to the hospital.
I don't wanna go there. I won't go there.
- What did I tell you?
- Now, don't get yourself all worked up.
Let me out here and I'll go home.
I can get a bus.
No, you can't do that. You're all wet.
- You'll catch pneumonia.
- I'll be all right.
Let her go if she wants to.
We might get into a jam.
You don't know what her racket is.
Bill, come on, pull up to the curb.
Say, I think you'd better take that robe with you. It's cold.
No, I'll be all right.
Thank you very much. It was kind of you.
Oh, Jack, Jack. Come here, get her.
The act is on again.
It looks as though the kid is starved.
I suppose you call that fixing too.
- What do you wanna do?
- Put her in the car.
We'll take her home.
What do you think we're gonna do?
Come on, take care of her now. Easy.
Well, what are you gonna do about that girl?
Are you running a sanitarium?
Are you still harping on that?
Put on a new record.
Haven't you had enough trouble with dames without going out and looking for it?
I wouldn't trust any of them.
But you gotta admit, they're awfully nice company.
Ahh...
Oh, why don't you snap out of it?
Say, your face is so long,
I'd charge you two prices for a shave.
What, you up?
Probably got a date with her manager.
Yes, I'm leaving.
I just wanted to thank you for being so kind.
Oh, don't thank him, lady.
He loves playing St. Nick for dames.
He picks up a woman every week, just to keep in practice.
Don't mind him.
He's rehearsing a vaudeville act.
And if he lets out one more crack,
I'll ring the curtain right down on his chin.
You can't walk out like this.
The doctor said you might get pneumonia.
Even the doctors play him for a sucker.
Say, why don't you wisen up?
Give her a break.
- Snake Eyes.
- Yes, sir?
- Draw another cup of java.
- Coming right up, boss.
I think you better stay put for a few days.
You look plenty weak.
Like The Wreck of the Hesperus?
Yeah, something like that.
I have a few questions
I wanna ask this young lady.
- Do you know who we are?
- No.
Only you've been very kind.
- Have you ever heard of Nick the Barber?
- Yes.
I've read about him in the papers.
He's a gambler, isn't?
Oh, I recognize you now.
Heh-heh-heh.
And you've never seen him before?
Only pictures in the newspapers.
Well, lady, you must have some cream.
Heh-heh.
Why did you jump off that bridge last night?
Are you sure you didn't fall off?
Say, what are you, a policeman or something?
Go on, get dressed.
I know what I'm doing.
Go on.
Mother knows best.
Your friend doesn't like me very well.
Don't take what that loogan said seriously.
- Really, he's a swell fellow.
- That's all right.
I'm used to abuse.
Hey, you'll be having Blondie crying in a minute. Heh-heh.
Come on, get hold of yourself.
- Were you working?
- I was, but I lost my job.
And then I got sick.
- Yeah, and you were broke, huh?
- I had a few dollars.
And some more things happened and... Heh.
Then last night.
I don't suppose it's very easy for you girls.
I was a coward.
Oh-ho-ho, coward...
Say, lots of people would be cowards if they went through what you did.
But I'm all straightened out now.
- Attagirl.
- I feel like a new person.
- Thanks for what you did.
- Oh-ho.
It's nothing, really. Heh-heh.
Oh, here.
You'll need a little stake.
- It's awfully kind of you, but I can't...
- Oh, that's all right. Come on.
I'll probably never be able to pay it back.
Well, that's all right, sister.
I own the mint. My brother gave it to me.
- Thanks. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
And keep off of bridges.
- Here, what's the matter?
- Oh, I was just a little dizzy.
But I feel all right again.
Now, look here.
You're not going out of here.
Not until you're better and get some color in those cheeks.
You're set on keeping that date with the undertakers, aren't you?
Nothing doing, you stay put.
You take orders from me,
I'm taking orders from the doctor.
The doctor's coming up to see you sometime today.
And you're not going out till he says the word.
Now, be a good girl.
Oh, here's the key.
Well, I'm glad to see you get rid of that ghost.
That dame gave me the creeps.
Well, you'd make a great copper.
You can guess more right things wrong than anybody I know.
Well, where is she, then?
In the bedroom, wise guy.
Say, how long is this gonna last?
- What's the big idea, you going screwy?
- Why don't you button up?
I'm only doing what any decent guy in the same spot would do.
She'll be gone in a couple of days.
And then you can be my sweetheart again, dearie.
Ahh...
- I've good news for you, Snake Eyes.
- Yes, ma'am?
This is the last time I'm gonna change the furniture around.
I'm glad to hear that.
I done thought you was gonna wear this furniture out, kicking it around.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Have a good sleep?
- I feel fine.
Good.
Well, so you've been at it again.
- Do you really like it?
- It looks swell.
What did you do with that picture of Jack Dempsey?
I put it in your den.
- You don't mind, do you?
- Oh, that's all right.
Say, you can put Tunney in the cellar if you want to. Ha-ha-ha.
It's been so much fun fixing up a place like this.
Yeah, I like it better myself, since you've been around.
Sit down, Nick.
There's something
I want to talk to you about.
Yeah?
Why...
What's on your mind, baby?
Why have you been so nice to me?
Oh, well, that's my nature.
Big-hearted Nick, they used to call me back in Irontown.
You've done so much.
There doesn't seem to be anything
I can do for you.
Why, you've done plenty.
Just being around is enough.
Don't you worry about that.
What's the matter?
- I was thinking maybe...
- Yeah?
Oh, no, no, no.
No, you don't owe me anything.
Now, you stay here as long as you like.
And the longer you stay, the better I like it.
And someday, maybe...
Oh!
Now, here, here, what's all this about?
Now, please, don't cry, baby.
There isn't a thing for you to worry about.
What's on your mind, honey?
I haven't been on the level with you, Nick.
- You're not from the DA's office?
- No.
But I haven't told you the whole truth about myself.
Oh, that's all right. I haven't told you the whole truth about myself either.
Did you know
I used to play the saxophone...
...in the Irontown band?
- Heh.
I'm serious, Nick.
- I'm wanted by the police.
- Police?
- What for?
- For blackmail.
- Blackmail?
- But it really wasn't blackmail.
I mean, I didn't intend to blackmail him at all.
I wanted you to know.
I might get you into some trouble with the police.
Police don't bother me none.
As far as they're concerned,
I'm just a barbershop proprietor.
They haven't got a thing on me.
- But don't you want me to get out now?
- What for?
I'm not exactly a Sunday school teacher myself.
I seem to be kind of a jinx wherever I go.
Well, you haven't been a jinx to me.
I hate to do this.
But it's the only way we can nail him.
Of course, it's really compounding a felony.
Well, what of it?
The end justifies the means.
And we've got to drive Nick out of this town.
The disgrace is we have to resort to such roundabout methods to get him.
But if we can put him in jail for only a few months...
...we can break up his ring.
The public and the press will lay off me.
The girl is here.
I picked her up at the Savoy.
Send her in.
Miss Graham, come in.
How do you do, Miss Graham?
Sit down, please.
Miss Graham, I have here a warrant charging you with blackmail.
And enough evidence to convict you.
L... I didn't mean to blackmail him.
That's your story.
But what you did is extortion in the eyes of the law.
And you can be sent to the penitentiary.
But there's a way you can avoid going to the penitentiary, Miss Graham.
- A very simple way.
- What do you expect me to do?
Just a little favor.
While checking up on Nick the Barber, we found that you live in his apartment.
That isn't true.
I live in a spare room down the hall.
Now, don't lie.
We watched every step both of you made for a week.
The sentence for blackmail,
Miss Graham...
...is two to 10 years in the penitentiary.
But you can avoid that if you'll just do what I ask you.
- Well, what is it?
- Not much.
Just this.
I want you to get me those gold keys that Nick's customers use for his gambling...
I won't.
- I haven't finished, Miss Graham.
- I don't care, I won't do it.
You can send me up.
Now, don't be foolish.
It's a case of you or him.
He'll never know you did it.
I won't. I won't!
Now, don't get excited.
All we wanna do is to give Nick a good scare.
He'll be out in a month.
That wouldn't hurt him at all.
While if you went to the penitentiary for a long sentence...
But he's the only the person that's ever been kind to me.
He's a public menace.
He's trying to corrupt public officials.
He's even put his filthy hands on policemen, state's attorneys.
- And even made overtures to our judges.
- I can't help it.
Leave me alone.
Please don't make me do it.
Oh, please.
Please.
- Have you a key, sir?
- Sure.
All bets down.
You look swell, baby.
You got class.
That's what I like about you.
I think you're about the prettiest little thing I've ever seen.
And the sweetest.
- I'm not what you think I am, Nick.
- What, not sweet?
Don't tell me, I know.
Nick used to be a sugar taster.
I've got something for you.
There.
Here.
Doesn't that look nice there?
- I can't take it, Nick.
- Oh, yes, you can.
And what's more, before long,
I'm gonna give you a ring.
For that finger.
What's the matter, honey?
- You're shaking like a leaf.
- I'm all upset tonight, Nick.
Have you a key, sir?
No, we're with headquarters.
Go on, break in.
It's a raid. Get rid of the gun.
It's a raid. You stay right here.
Go get him. Get up.
I thought so.
It was you who let those coppers in.
You dirty little stool pigeon.
- Oh!
What's this all about?
Lay off, Nick.
She's planting evidence on you.
She put it in the inside coat pocket.
- I'm telling you, now look for yourself.
- Hmm?
Why, it's nothing but a racing form, you smack-off.
Lay off, I'm telling you. Quit it.
I'm trying to steer you straight.
Steer you straight.
- I'm gonna let you have it.
- Yes. You won't.
Yeah.
Yeah, I'll show him, treating you like that.
Come on, Nick. Let's go downtown.
What for? You got nothing on me.
I'm just a guest here, like a hundred others.
I like your company.
You can't hang anything on me.
I don't own this place.
Look up the deed in the Recorder's Office.
- You don't, eh?
- No.
All I own here is what I've got on.
We like your company.
It's hot and stuffy here.
Let's take a walk.
Hmm.
You got good manners for cops.
Heh-heh.
All right, I'll oblige you.
For all the good it's gonna do you. Heh-heh.
All you've got here is what you got on.
- Is that it, Nick?
- Yeah, that's it.
Then you've got plenty.
That's nothing but a racing form.
You probably don't know there's an old blue law...
...that classifies a racing form as gambling paraphernalia.
Makes possession of one punishable by a six-month jail sentence.
I didn't know it myself till just a few days ago.
But I know it now, Nick.
And so do you.
- Why, you dirty, you double-crosser...
Here.
- What's the matter with this fellow?
- I socked him.
And I'm darned sorry.
He didn't have it coming.
- He's unconscious.
- Let's be going, Nick.
- This fellow isn't unconscious. He's dead.
- What's that?
Look out, here.
Jack! Jack!
Jack! Jack, I'm talking to you.
Jack.
It looks like manslaughter...
...or murder now, Nick.
- So you gave me the works, huh?
- Yes, Nick.
I did it.
But I didn't think it would be for anything like this.
I've always been a little coward.
Oh, Nick, could you ever forgive me?
That's all right, Irene.
I've always been a sucker for women.
Come on, Black. Let's go.
Hold it for a picture, Nick.
- Oh, sure, just a minute.
All right.
Thanks.
Yeah, Snake Eyes.
I brought Blondie along.
Thought you might like to say goodbye.
Yeah.
Hey, you sure
I can't take her along with me?
Nothing doing.
No blonds where you're going, Nick.
Well, Blondie, no use two of us going up there, eh?
- Take this rabbit's foot, boss.
- Not a chance.
You gave me one of those once before.
I didn't mean no harm, because I loves you, Mr. Nick.
Here's the way to give me luck.
So long, Snake Eyes. I'll be seeing you.
Well...
Come on over, Marie, the water's fine.
I suppose I should be glad...
...you're going up, Nick...
...after the way you've treated me.
But I'm not.
I came down here to laugh in your face...
...but I can't.
Oh, that's all right, Marie.
You're a swell guy.
I deserved what I got.
Oh, that's all right, Marie.
I'm sorry the way everything turned out between us.
I guess somebody must have been dealing from the bottom.
Well, here.
Buy yourself a box of candy.
You know I don't eat it.
It gets in my teeth. Heh-heh-heh.
All aboard.
- Yeah.
Come on, Nick, let's go.
- I'll be seeing you. Heh.
Hey, Nick, bye-bye.
I'll be seeing you.
Any final statement, Nick?
- Sure.
Tell my public I've put the close clippers on other fellas before this.
And now I'm gonna find out what it's like myself.
I wonder how I'll look with that monkey haircut they give you there.
Hey, Nick. How about a picture?
All right, just a minute. I'll tell you when.
- All right.
- Good.
So long, Nick. See you in 10 years.
Ten years?
I'll bet you 2-to-1 I'm out in five.
Doctor, the captain told me we were in the South Seas now.
Right in the heart of them.
That's right, madame.
The South Sea islands.
The last hiding place of beauty and adventure.
That's what all the travel folders say.
I thought you'd been here before, and that you adored the islands.
Yes, I do in my own way.
What's that wretched-looking spot we're passing?
It's one of the South Sea isles.
Nothing like that is mentioned in the folders.
Well, it's a little in disrepute.
It was mentioned in all the folders once.
That silly-looking sand waste?
Has it a name?
It's the island of Manukura.
That was once the most beautiful of all the islands... that raised their little green heads above these waters.
The most beautiful and enchanting bit of paradise in all the world.
I always throw it a kiss when I pass it.
Excuse me, madame.
What happened to it?
It made the mistake of being born in the heart of the hurricane belt.
You've stolen a canoe.
Stealing is against the law.
You must pay the penalty for breaking the law.
You are sentenced to 30 days punishment.
When you have finished 30 days, you will know better than to break the law again.
I don't understand.
He says...
He's defending himself against the power of the French government and very ably.
Does he deny the theft?
No. He offers in rebuttal that there was moonlight.
An awful lot of it.
And his lady love says... she saw a gold fish in the sea.
My dear doctor...
I am as sensitive to the whims of love as the next man.
But as governor of these islands,
I cannot afford... to sit 'round admiring the quaint and the curious.
Thirty days, my good fellow.
It's not exactly my business, de Laage... but you've only been here a year.
Whereas I, indolent wretch... have spent a pitifully long time on these islands.
- I know these people.
- You're wasting your time pleading.
I'm not pleading.
I'm pleading for you... not this scoundrel of a canoe thief.
You're a sensitive man.
You'll do something to yourself if you govern these somewhat childish people... according to your ideas instead of theirs.
You'll destroy yourself.
That sounds very ominous. What is that?
Father Paul has sighted the Katopua.
- He's chattering in his belfry.
- Come along, Doctor.
You can complain about my tyrannical soul to Madame de Laage.
Your wife will like it if you let this miserable canoe-snatcher go.
As a homecoming gift!
Chief Mehevi, he's sentenced to
30 days hard labor on the coral reef.
My dear Doctor...
I am ready to give my wife and my friends anything I own in the world... except my sense of honor and duty.
A sense of honor in the South Seas is about as useful and often as silly... as a silk hat in a hurricane.
Marama!
- I think the ship never comes home.
- Me, too.
I think the wind never blows.
I feel like praying... for the wind that overturns the world to hurry the Katopua home.
I worry about everything when you're away.
About the wind, the waves.
Sometimes I worry the fish eat you up.
Me? You worry about me?
- Why I'm the best sailor in the world!
- I know.
- I'm the best swimmer, too.
- I know.
And tonight when we come out of church,
I'm the best husband in the world.
- I know, I know.
- Shut up. You don't know anything yet.
Eugene.
- Oh, Germaine.
- Darling, it seemed forever!
All my happiness went with you to France... but it's returned now.
O Heavenly Father... we thank Thee for the safe return of our loved ones.
Amen.
Your health, madame.
We certainly missed your civilizing influence.
Here's to your homecoming.
Your health, Doctor, and Father Paul's and yours, Chief Mehevi.
All our people are happy that you come back.
Thank you. Tell me, Father Paul... how's my husband been conducting himself in my absence?
Like a good governor.
- Has he fallen under the tropic's spell?
- No, madame!
He's been staunchly under the spell of honor and duty.
I don't suppose there's any use of my inquiring... whether my uncle answered my application to return to France?
No. He said nothing.
Farewell, old Cafe de Rostand for another year.
I'm sorry.
Yes. And in Paris, our good doctor would weep day and night... for his little half-drowned homeland... the island of Manukura.
Why, he's as deeply rooted in this place as I am, or Chief Mehevi.
My roots are parched, Captain.
We'll drink this one to Mehevi.
I brought him back the finest bridegroom in the islands.
Yes, I know. I see him jump from mast.
Who's that?
Terangi.
I'm delighted to hear the news. I didn't know he was marrying your daughter.
You've been too busy with your report cards to France.
The romance is known to every child in the islands.
I'm delighted.
Terangi is utterly charming.
He was delightful on the trip.
He'd hang from the top of the mast like a bird with wings stretched for home.
I hope you'll be able to leave him behind for one voyage, Captain.
He's planning on spending his honeymoon in a canoe.
It won't be a long honeymoon.
I'd as soon sail without sails as without my first mate.
The more I see these natives, the more
I think they're more bird than man.
Terangi can smell a wind before it's begun to blow.
He knows every rock on the sea bottom... and he runs a ship as if it were a pair of shoes.
I was saying that very thing to de Laage.
I wasted ten good minutes pointing out he's the governor of a flock of birds.
Not birds that should be put in a cage... but birds that should be allowed to flutter through the sky which they own.
With stolen canoes in their bills, you forgot to mention.
When are the nuptials to take place, Father?
The wedding will begin at sundown... and will continue until the entire native population is exhausted.
Wait a minute. I wanna give a toast.
My dear people...
I am very happy and I'm a little sad... because when I return to France... any day now...
I shall miss your happy faces.
But I leave with you my very, very dearest love.
And to Terangi... and Marama...
Terangi, I had a dream.
I had no dream. I slept.
Terangi, don't sail away on the ship.
Without me, the ship doesn't move.
It stands still in the middle of a wind.
Don't sail away.
I don't want to, but I smell a wind coming.
By noon, the wind will be good.
I dreamed that all the birds flew away from Manukura.
From Manukura?
Where did they fly to?
There's no place to go.
They flew away.
Did you dream there was a wind?
No. It was quiet.
Only the sky was full of birds flying away.
The dream's no good.
Because how could the birds fly away if there is no wind?
They only leave when the ifu mantui comes.
The wind that overturns the world.
The world is gone when you go away.
Stay here.
You're married a few days and already you're an old wife full of worries.
What are you worried about?
- About your going away.
- I come back!
- If something happens to the boat...
- I swim back. Where's my cap?
It's very funny what a difference a cap makes in the world.
In Tahiti, when I wear this cap, everybody is my friend.
You think I'm just Terangi who swam with you when you were a little fish.
In Tahiti, when I sit in a cafe with this cap on I'm the same as a white man.
Take me with you.
No, please. I like to, but I can't.
Please! I won't take any room.
I'll sleep on top of the mast.
You can hang me over the boat's side at night and pull me along with a rope.
Only take me. Please, take me.
Quiet, quiet.
What in blazes are you doin' aboard this boat, Marama?
Please, I go to Tahiti.
- How did she get aboard? You bring her?
- No, I come in a bag like a coconut.
What's wrong with going to Tahiti?
I never been. I go just once.
Listen, the longer you stay aboard, the further you'll have to swim back.
You have no reason to go to Tahiti.
Oh, yes. I buy a dress with a ribbon on.
And red shoes with high heels.
And a hat with a feather, and a petticoat with flounces.
And a doll that dances.
All right. You stay on board.
But we'll take Terangi's cap away and he's through being a first mate.
I can't have a first mate with a bride.
He'll be an ordinary sailor.
Scrubbing decks. Gimme that cap.
Oh, no, no. Don't take his cap.
No, Terangi, he won't.
Good-bye.
Hurry back.
Aloha!
I can't give you anything but love
Marama!
Get up!
Get up!
Get up, I said!
Clear out!
Get up when a white man tells ya!
Terangi, get back on the ship.
My warrant says the man's jaw was broken.
I don't care if his jaw was broken!
Pity it wasn't his neck.
I saw the whole thing, and my mate is not to blame.
If you're his witness, Captain, there won't be any trouble.
But he's got to be surrendered.
All right. Come on.
But I'm going along.
I'll see the governor about this.
I've spent hours, Governor, trying to find out why my first mate... is sentenced to six months in jail for doing exactly as you or I would do.
Your boy hits too hard.
Not hard enough. I saw the whole thing.
I even testified in court.
The sentence is unjust.
But surely six months in jail isn't unheard of... in a serious case of assault and battery.
Come, Nagle, it isn't a matter of life and death.
You don't know the Tuamotu natives.
They're not like your Tahitians.
They can't stand confinement.
There's something behind this. A matter of maintaining European prestige?
A native mustn't raise his hand against a white man?
Your boy not only hit too hard... but he hit the wrong man.
That rum-soaked bully.
Strange as it seems, he has influence at home.
As soon as he recovered consciousness in the hospital... he cabled the Ministry of Colonies.
So Terangi is made a victim of politics.
I'm afraid you're right, Nagle.
I sail for Manukura in three days.
You can't pardon him?
Later, perhaps. Not now.
I've done all I can.
You'll have to take your punishment quietly and cheerfully.
You hit too hard, man. That's all.
The next time you hit a man, take care not to break his jaw.
You're too much of a man to store up any bitterness.
Your berth will be waiting on my ship.
Time will pass quickly.
I'll explain everything to your wife.
Will you give her this?
Sure, I will.
Don't you worry about her.
Remember what I've told you.
I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll put him on the road gang.
Keep him outdoors all day.
He's going to take his medicine all right.
I hope so.
Wasting water, eh, convict?
The Katopua.
And wouldn't you like to be going home on her!
Come on, pick 'em up. Get movin'.
Captain Nagle!
Chappeli, coffee.
Captain Nagle!
I wouldn't have had this happen for anything, son.
It just hangs another year on your sentence. That's the penalty.
That's what I've got to go by: The law.
Lucky you didn't break from the inside.
That would've added five years.
Now you behave yourself.
We don't want to keep you here any longer than we've got to.
The long and short of it was,
I couldn't do a thing for Terangi.
How silly, how unjust.
- It's up to you.
- To me?
I fail to see in what way.
As governor of his island, you can ask to have him paroled in your care.
And much as I should like to do just that...
I don't think it wise to interfere with the administration of the law.
Oh, administration of fiddlesticks!
The man's absolutely right.
It isn't a matter of law.
It's political pull and injustice.
Just a minute. Let me explain the case a little less legally.
De Laage, our friend Terangi isn't just an errand-running islander.
He's the best loved of every man, woman and three-year-old child in Manukura.
You're not only allowing him to rot in jail, but offending your subjects.
And what's worse, you're hurting yourself.
Your concern for my soul has flattered me for some time.
I must ask you to concern yourself with my more physical ailments.
He means well, dear.
He's only saying what we all think.
I know he means well.
I know you all mean well.
But I am not the representative of well-meaning points of view.
I represent a civilization... that cannot afford to show confusion or conflict to the people it governs.
The law has spoken in Tahiti.
I must uphold that law.
Would it influence your sense of duty at all... to know that Mrs. Terangi is about to be a mother?
Really?
That's wonderful!
That puts everything in a different light. Explain to the authorities.
No. It puts me in a worse light.
Now I'm not only Terangi's persecutor,
I'm the oppressor of an unborn child.
I think it's unfair to appeal to a side of me that's very strong... but that simply cannot function as governor.
I understand you, de Laage.
Thank you.
And my heart feels sad for you.
Though six months isn't forever.
Terangi's young.
Let's make the best of it.
So easy to say, Father.
But I have to tell her.
Yes. He sent her a little gift.
Oh, I'll take it to her.
There's no need for you to put yourself out, darling.
Yes, there is.
In six months, it'll all be over.
He'll be back, and you'll both forget so soon.
Go away.
I want you to come with me and live in my house while you're waiting.
There's a lovely garden and you can sit...
I don't go to your house.
It'll be easier.
I don't want it any easier.
Terangi in a jail.
You're right.
It won't be long... because no jail can hold Terangi very long.
If it has a window, he'll fly away.
If it has water around it, he'll swim away.
And everybody will laugh at the jail that tried to hold Terangi.
They'll laugh.
It's another two years, Terangi.
Every time you try to break out, it's two more years.
Understand? Two more years.
That's two more years, Terangi.
He cannot possibly escape.
- You have jurisdiction over this case!
- I don't deny it.
You're the only man who can save him from this mad thing that's happening.
- He's broken the law.
- What law?
The law that condemned him unjustly to prison?
That refused him the simple rights of a human being?
I can't.
Eugene, don't be angry at what I'm going to say.
I love you. I know your heart.
Please stop. My feelings are my own.
I won't have them discussed.
Sixteen years in a cell with rats for companions! And for what?
For thinking himself greater than the law.
For breaking jail.
For defying authority.
Man alive! You can't do it!
You know what these people are, and Terangi's the best of them.
He'll not live in a cell! He'll die!
You're condemning an innocent man to death... out of a cold-blooded whim called honor and duty.
Will you listen to Mehevi? Perhaps the chief can think of something.
Tell him what you think would be just.
Excellency... the people in my island were all happy before.
Now they're very unhappy.
This is not good law or good justice.
You once asked me not to worry about your soul... but to concern myself with more pharmaceutical matters.
Well, I'm back on that worry.
You're not only condemning poor Terangi, you're condemning yourself.
You're condemning yourself to black nights and dreams of ugly remorse... to the betterment of a man who prefers to be a martinet instead of a human.
You'll see your guilt as a man written in every face in Manukura.
You'll walk as if you were dead among them, without a smile or a greeting... if you lived in these islands for 100 years.
It'll dry you up!
It’ll kill your heart.
I am doing my duty.
I come of a family that has administered my country's affairs for generations.
I understand how strongly your humanitarian feelings run.
And yours, Germaine, and yours, Mehevi.
Understand mine then. They run as deep.
There is no Terangi.
There is only a man who has set himself above and beyond the law.
It is not a question of justice or injustice to a human being.
It is a question of upholding the law under which these islands are governed.
I am not asking for anyone's smiles as my reward.
Take a good look, convict.
You haven't got fat Sam to deal with.
He wouldn't take my advice and now he's out.
And now I'm in.
And by all that's holy, you're in.
And you're gonna serve every day of your 16 years.
And if you ever want that iron off your leg... you're gonna break, see?
You're gonna open that ugly mouth of yours and act like a human being!
Get that door open! Hurry up!
Come on, you blundering fool!
Warden.
Did you ask the doctor over tonight for chess?
Yes. I'm sorry, he was busy.
And Father Paul?
He had a christening.
What's that noise?
I don't know.
There's no festival this time of year.
What are you going to do?
Gonna have a walk, take a look around.
I'll go with you.
Get your wrap.
I will.
Perhaps it's something nice, a native dance we haven't been told about.
Get your wrap.
Mehevi!
I heard this noise.
I came here to find out what it was.
The people are celebrating, Excellency.
- What are they celebrating?
- Their happiness, Excellency.
- What has given them happiness?
- Terangi.
- What about him?
- He has escaped, Excellency.
When did you hear this?
Who brought the news?
I have had no official report.
600 miles from Tahiti.
The drums have brought the news.
The birds have brought it.
Do you hear that wind?
It came on the wind.
What have you got to say to all this?
Is there any law against dancing and singing when the heart's happy?
As your governor, I demand what information you have.
Is he on this island? Have you seen him?
You don't have to see him.
He's a legend.
You can celebrate him like Bastille Day.
He's the soul and symbol of all these good people.
No cage can hold 'em.
They're the last of the world's afflicted race of humans... who believe in freedom.
Look at 'em dance!
There's the island's answer to your law.
How long have you known of his escape?
- The last voyage.
- Why wasn't I informed?
It was an official matter.
I saw no reason to interfere with the excellent official communication system.
Murder!
Did you know there was a man murdered by him?
He broke the bars that held him in a cage he didn't belong.
But murder!
I imagine this puts an end to the legend of Terangi.
There'll be no more escapes.
He'll be caught and sent where he belongs.
Sent to the fortress of Cayenne and stowed away in a dungeon... until he's dead and forgotten.
Dead and forgotten like any law breaker.
Murder and anarchy will leave no legend behind.
Father!
- What do you see, lad?
- There.
What is it? A log?
No. There's a man hanging on it.
Feel better?
Yes, Father.
And you came from Tahiti in that canoe?
Yes.
At least 600 miles.
Why did you come?
I want to go home.
They say you killed a man.
I don't know.
I hit him hard.
- Did you mean to kill?
- No! Only to go home.
You're only a few miles away now.
Before you tell, Father, let me go home for one day.
I have a daughter.
I've never seen her.
And Marama.
Tell me, Father, has she waited for me?
Yes, she's waited.
It's good to be alive... after being drowned.
How can I be your judge?
You've sinned, but others have sinned more against you.
You weren't meant for evil.
You were made to do evil.
How can I judge?
You won't tell, Father?
No.
We found you in the sea, we shall leave you on land... near to those who love you.
No, you owe me no thanks, my son.
This is between me... and somebody else.
Father, can I tell Marama that Terangi's waiting for her on Motu Tonga?
No need to. She's there.
Went there yesterday, fishing.
To Motu Tonga? He doesn't know it.
Why didn't you tell him?
What? And spoil their surprise tomorrow morning?
You young rascal, I'm ashamed of you.
Mama, I saw a man.
A strange man.
A strange man?
Why, Tita, there are no strange men.
Marama, I've come back.
I've been waiting.
Eight years. Long time.
You are the same.
You?
The same.
Who is that?
She is Tita.
Mine?
Yes.
This is what I dreamed of all the time.
I dreamed I'd see you again, and my child.
They'll find you and take you away.
They can't take this hour away, or this day.
They can only take away tomorrow.
I heard.
I have waited as long as I dared.
You must go now.
- They know?
- The island knows, but not de Laage.
Not yet. He will find out.
He will hunt you down.
De Laage?
Why will he hunt me?
What have I done against him?
His heart is black against you.
You must go tonight.
- Where, Father?
- Fenua Ino.
Fenua Ino. The forbidden place.
It is taboo. No one goes there.
No one will look there.
You will be safe there until you die.
Stay hidden till the darkness.
We will load my big canoe.
You will start when the island is asleep.
Gee, quite a wind coming up.
This is the worst I've seen or heard for a long time.
Like devils running around.
Can you imagine Paris in a wind like this?
All the silk hats blowing off, all the bouquets blowing away.
All the ashcans bouncing down the avenue.
I'm afraid civilization wouldn't look very pretty in a high wind.
I've missed you from our dinner table, Doctor.
Eugene's been pining for a game of chess for a long time.
So have I. You know...
Eugene and I have been having a feud.
- Cognac, Doctor?
- No, thanks.
Sort of a battle of souls.
Let's check our souls for tonight, de Laage.
Let's be Frenchmen, both of us.
You're not angry at the doctor, are you?
No, I'm not angry at anyone.
It's they who are angry with me, all of them.
Black looks and mutterings.
Father Paul! Why isn't he here tonight?
Praying for my soul, I suppose.
They love their precious murderer.
Let's forget Terangi, just for tonight.
Forget him? He haunts this island like a school of ghosts.
I can no longer sense what's going on.
I took a walk through the village today.
- There's something strange in the air.
- Strange?
Well, the wind gives the island a different smell.
No, not the wind.
The natives behaved queerly.
Some of them smiled at me.
Kept watching me and smiling.
I had a feeling something queer was going on behind my back.
Something strange. Hidden.
Important.
The only thing important that's happening in the village today... is that Mama Rua is dying.
Terangi's mother.
Afraid she's gonna die.
And Marama's sister's having a baby.
I play a kind of chess game... with the oldest gambler in the world: Death.
He takes Mama Rua... and I checkmate him with a baby.
I think I'll have another drop of cognac... just to keep the wind out of my bones on the way home.
I've never been on the island in a storm. Do they get bad?
I've heard tales of them.
Winds that blow the islands out of the sea.
But I think Manukura is pretty well anchored.
At least part of it.
The devil's abroad tonight!
We're all on edge tonight.
What are you doing, boy?
Answer me.
What are you up to?
What are you doing with the chief's canoe?
Stealing?
Stubborn, eh? Very well.
Come along to Father Paul's house with me.
Be careful with the sail.
- Excuse me coming at this hour, Father.
- You are welcome.
- I want your help.
- It's yours, de Laage.
- You know this boy?
- Yes. Mako. He's a good boy.
- He won't lie to you, Father Paul.
- Oh, no.
Ask him where he was going with that canoe.
Whose canoe?
A boat loaded with food.
Food being smuggled to Terangi.
He's on this island. He's being hidden.
He's waiting for the boy in that canoe.
Father, I didn't tell! I didn't tell!
Hear that? He confesses.
Captain Nagle smuggled him in.
I'd been waiting for that.
And you refused to come to my home tonight. Why?
Because you know. You were afraid to face me. You're guilty.
They're all guilty. The whole island.
I'll break Nagle for this.
Neither this boy nor Captain Nagle had anything to do with it.
Terangi was picked up at sea ten miles from here.
By whom?
You! When?
Last night.
You helped Terangi.
You, my own priest!
- I'm his priest, too.
- You helped a murderer.
I aided a man whose heart is innocent.
You betrayed your own government.
You've given aid to anarchy and bloodshed.
- I'll answer for it.
- You'll answer me, Priest.
- Where is he?
- I don't know.
He knows! You're in the presence of your own priest, boy!
You dare not lie. Where is Terangi?
Would you ask this child to betray someone he loves?
I'm asking him to tell the law what he knows.
The government demands information against the murderer.
There are stronger things than governments in this world.
Something deeper.
More real.
This child has that in his heart.
Though you tortured him, he wouldn't speak.
He shall pay for his silence.
And I shall bless him for it.
- I've never seen the barometer so low.
- Did you send my note to Captain Nagle?
Yes, he's waiting inside.
I'll come to the point at once.
I am commandeering your schooner.
- This wind is too strong to be out in.
- How soon can you be ready to sail?
- The weather's bad.
- How soon can you be ready to sail?
- Nagle's thinking of your safety.
- He's trying to frighten you.
I'm not trying to frighten anybody.
We can't find Terangi in this storm.
- It'll get worse.
- It'll blow itself out in 24 hours.
If I delay, it may be too late.
He'll get away.
We're in the track of a rising wind.
The barometer's falling!
- You must listen.
- I'll listen to one voice, my own.
De Laage, I told you you'll end by destroying yourself.
I'm ordering your schooner in the name of the government.
Take him along.
Go out in this wind, de Laage.
Maybe you'll find something more important than Terangi.
When you feel the might of the sea and wind, maybe you'll discover... there's something greater in this world than the French criminal code.
Terangi's out there.
He's paddling through this storm in a canoe.
Go chase him. Then hear God howl and laugh at you.
- Get your ship ready.
- I'll be ready when you are.
Oh, Eugene.
Look! What is it?
The birds. They're flying away, like your dream.
- Terangi, where are you going?
- Back to Manukura.
Look!
The great storm is coming, the wind that overturns the land.
Go to Tavi's store.
Get ropes. Anchor your houses.
Take to the trees if the sea should cover the land.
- Go quickly!
- Go!
- What's that?
- Either the wind or end of the world.
And me with a baby to deliver.
- Take her to the church.
- No. Surf boat! Surf boat better.
Surf boats? Are you crazy?
Sea will cover land. Surf boat better!
All right, take her to the surf boats.
Surf boats! And I commit suicide.
- You'll need me to help you.
- Everyone go to the church.
No! Sea rising. Carry church away.
No, the church is on high ground.
Come with me.
No, come to the boat!
Come on.
The reef!
It's breaking.
Come on!
Come on!
Father, will the sea rise and cover the island?
We're on the highest spot here, my daughter.
Even if the sea reaches us, the walls will keep it out.
The church! It's going!
Father Paul, come. The sea is breaking in. The walls are going. Look!
Take those who want to go.
I am staying here.
You will drown.
You saved me. Take my arm and let me save you.
- No, my son. Take madame.
- No, I'll stay here with you.
Take her back safe to the world that has wronged you.
Please, madame, go. Terangi, take her.
Yes, Father.
Those of you who wish to go, go now.
Those who wish to sing with me for the last time, stay.
Where is the child?
There.
Is it boy or girl?
You don't know! You haven't got it!
It's dead!
No, my daughter. It's here, alive.
It's a boy!
How many survivors, Doctor?
Is that all?
Germaine, my wife?
I wish it could've been me instead of her.
I gave you up as well.
How did you pull through?
We were at the edge of the hurricane.
You were at the center.
What is it, Terangi?
A canoe.
A war canoe.
Then Father Paul took your wife to the church. It seemed the safest place.
I'd have gone too, except I couldn't desert my patient.
That's the last you saw of her?
It grew so dark, you couldn't see the church from the reef boat.
But when that bell stopped ringing,
I knew what happened.
As soon as you can get your engine running, we'll make a search... for survivors.
I must make a report, list all dead.
I shall want all details.
Come with me to the ship.
The ship will find us. I know that.
The ship will come, and then they'll take Terangi.
Oh, no, Marama, no.
But I know they will.
Terangi knows it.
But I'll make them take Tita and me, too.
Be quiet, Marama.
It doesn't matter now.
We're lucky to be alive.
Katopua.
- Good-bye, Marama.
- Good-bye, madame.
Good-bye, little Tita.
God bless you, Terangi.
Captain!
Easy left!
Germaine.
My dear. My dear.
I thought I lost you, but I never gave up hope.
Germaine, forgive me.
Forgive you? For what?
For everything I failed to be since we were married.
I faced it all today.
I've nearly gone mad.
Take me back to the boat now.
I'm so dreadfully tired.
I know, dear.
- Where are the others?
- There are no others. Not a soul.
I was tied to a tree and drifted here alone. All the others were lost.
Let's go back to the boat.
Eugene, take me back to the boat!
There's something out there.
It's only a floating log.
You're right, Germaine.
It's only a floating log.

All right, tie her up.
Make her fast.
Pull her in, boys.
Leave those.
They don't even know where they're taking themselves yet. Get it moving!
Ask him.
Pardon me, my good man, but we're looking for the residency.
We better be careful. They probably belong to some fighting tribes in the interior.
Here, here, here. Go on, you blighters.
Off it. Go on. Off it, off it. The very idea.
That's the only language those poor heathens understand, sir.
Herbert Henry Rawlins, at your service.
Thank you so much.
We're looking for the residency.
Residency or resident?
Resident. Righto.
It so happens his nibs is at my employer's compound...
...checking out a shipment of wild animals.
Well, sir, how was merry old
England when you left it?
- Well...
- Yeah, a bit of all right, eh?
You, miss, how do you find your first go at Africa?
Grim enough, I suppose. But look at me, making you answer a lot of questions.
I'll bet you're just tired of talking. Well, anything you want to know, just ask me.
- Well, there was one...
- Oh, here we are.
Excuse me, governor. Two young people from home wanna see the resident.
I'm the resident.
Masters is my name.
How do you do? I'm Eric Parker.
- This is my sister, Rita.
- How do you do?
Miss Parker, you're not exactly a usual sight around these parts.
Nor any parts, for that matter, I should say. My name is Fry. Captain Fry.
No, you fool!
Can't have my pet ripped up by a common cat.
- Your pet?
- Yes, over there in that cage.
Like to see him?
He doesn't look like he needed protection.
Oh, no. He'd make short work of a common leopard.
Color of their hide seems to get into their dispositions.
- He's too valuable to be mauled, though.
- I'm terrified of him.
Even with these bars between us.
Don't you worry, Miss Parker.
I designed that cage myself.
Duralumin.
I'll guarantee it'll hold anything.
We won't keep you any longer from your business.
Well, it's nothing private, Captain Fry.
Rita and I are just looking for something called the Mutia Escarpment.
Is that all?
My dear boy, perhaps you'd like us to arrange a visit to the craters of the moon.
I don't know what you're laughing at, but
I assure you, it's a serious matter to us.
In Africa, the most serious matter is always the noonday sun.
Yes, it makes ladies and gentlemen talk a bit barmy-like.
Especially until they get a bit climaxed to it.
Since we seem to be so ridiculously green, perhaps you would point out what it is.
Well, first, the single approach to the Mutia Escarpment...
...is said to lie through the Gaboni country.
A cheery lot, the Gabonis.
- I've never seen one. Have you, Fry?
- No.
Although I've seen victims floating down the river...
...after the Gabonis finished with them.
- Bring some drinks, Rawlins.
- Yes.
Only the largest and most completely equipped safari...
...could hope to fight through.
And as you say, that's beyond the means of most people.
In the second place, from the native rumors of the escarpment...
...I should judge it quite impractical for even a large party.
They say it's like a long cloud in the distance.
Sheer cliffs 1000 to 1500 feet in height and running out of sight in either direction.
Bomba, limes.
But isn't there always a third place,
Captain Fry?
Oh, yes, I was coming to that.
In the third place, no safari native could be induced to disregard the juju.
- What's juju?
- Black magic, taboo, anything forbidden.
Oh, dear. Really.
When you've lived as long in Africa as Captain Fry, Miss Parker...
...you'll realize that there's a certain amount...
...of truth underlying all native superstitions.
What is the nature of this particular superstition?
- Well...
- A race of great apes. With a leader.
A very capable leader, too, with power of life and death over the entire jungle.
The oddest thing, according to these stories, is his color.
- His color?
- White.
Blimey. A white gorilla?
Do you believe this?
Well, I believe that up there, where no white man's ever been before...
...waits someone, or shall we say, something...
...mysterious and formidable natives fear.
A thing that doesn't want to be disturbed.
There you have it, Miss Parker.
Cliffs, savages and the taboo.
A combination nobody could beat.
But one man did beat it, Mr. Masters.
A white hunter named Harry Holt.
Oh, yes, I remember the fellow.
Claimed to have discovered the Elephants' Graveyard, didn't he?
Yes, Holt's real motive then was very much what ours is now.
Mr. Masters, we have reason to believe...
...that our cousin Jane is alive at this moment...
...above the Mutia Escarpment, living among the great apes.
There you are, governor. The monks have been known to carry off a native woman.
Yes, but the leader isn't an ape.
Now, Holt was quite clear on that point.
The leader is a man, a white man. And
Jane is staying there by her own wish.
Admitting this extraordinary story to be true...
...would you be good enough to explain...
...what you hope to accomplish even if you should find your cousin?
Well, you see, our father and Jane's father had a third brother, Uncle Peter.
He was extremely wealthy and rather difficult.
When he took it into his eccentric old head to die last spring...
...he left half of his fortune of nearly a million pounds...
...to the London University for the purposes of entomological research.
- Come again, miss?
- Bugs.
The second half he left to Jane, providing she was alive...
...and could be induced to return to civilization.
Otherwise, the bugs get the whole million.
And if you succeed in bringing this good news to your cousin...
...you hope to profit to some extent.
Well, I've staked every penny
I've got on it.
And if we fail, it means, amongst other things...
...that Eric won't finish his medical studies.
Well, if you're in a position to adequately equip a safari...
...under the direction of a well-qualified man, Captain Fry, for instance...
But then, you heard Captain Fry's opinion of the whole enterprise.
If you and your brother care to join me...
...I'll be making safari for the Mutia
Escarpment at 7:00 tomorrow morning.
Bomba!
- Captain Fry...
- Don't waste your time thanking me.
You'll need to get properly outfitted before you leave tomorrow.
Captain Fry, before we accept your very kind offer...
...would you mind telling us why you made it?
We'll say I need a vacation with just a touch of adventure thrown in. Just that.
We'll be ready at 7:00 tomorrow morning.
Well, hang me.
The biggest blooming hunter in the whole blinking continent...
...turning himself into a glorified tourist guide.
And all for the sake of a dash of adventure.
Oh, come off it, governor.
What's the idea?
Gonna try and catch you that mythological white ape?
- You're right.
- Thank you.
You're right for the first time in 10 years.
We're making safari at 7:00 tomorrow morning.
Knock down the steel cage and box it to go.
- Don't stand there like a...
- Fool?
- Right. Get going.
- Yes, sir.
Look at those.
I say, aren't they awful-Iooking creatures?
- We land here, Bomba.
- Yes, bwana.
Well, that's what I meant.
- Bomba, those four top boxes. Look alive.
- Yes, bwana.
But, Captain Fry, this place is a bog.
I'm sorry. I didn't choose it myself.
Get ashore, please.
Come along, Rita.
- Not that way, Miss Parker.
- Well, why not?
Ever chuck a stick into a hornets' nest?
That's our route.
The swamp will cover our tracks and it's the right direction, as far as I can judge.
Well, you'll get through all right,
Miss Parker.
Pretty squashy going.
Oh, well, I like paddling.
Eric, look.
Wouldn't shoot if I were you. They won't bother us if we don't bother them.
There's no sense in advertising our presence.
If it's all the same to you, Mr. Parker,
I'd like to keep it a secret.
- Look at them all. Isn't it amazing?
- This is certainly a hunter's paradise.
You haven't seen anything yet.
Oh, look at that lot!
They're handy little things to have about the house.
And all of those.
Oh, aren't they grand?
Captain Fry.
There's your Mutia Escarpment,
Mr. Parker.
All right, push them along, Bomba.
Stir them up with that kaibok.
Captain Fry!
Juju, bwana.
Oh, why not take a tip from their natural instincts, sir, and let the whole thing go.
- I mean, this is Gaboni country.
- Right.
Till I think of a way to push these boys, it looks like we'll stay here.
We camp here, Bomba. No tents.
Send one of the boys for water.
Why, you little...
What is it?
You pretty creature.
Thank you so much.
I'm sorry I was such a nuisance.
Well, I'd rather not have to do any more shooting while we're around here.
- Water yet?
- Water not yet, bwana.
Send another boy.
Gabonis. Get the men ready to move.
Still clear on the juju side.
We'll cross the river and make a run for it.
Get them together, Bomba.
Hey, we won't leave that. Quickly!
- What was it? An animal?
- Whatever it was, we should be grateful.
Grateful to the Gabonis too, I suppose, what's left of us.
We've got no choice now.
Get the men started, Bomba.
We're going up.
Men say no go, bwana. Men say juju.
All right, let them stay.
See how they like the Gabonis.
That was a close thing.
Blinking close.
Blimey. I wouldn't climb another step, not even to get up to heaven.
Maybe you're nearer than you think.
We camp here, Bomba. Tents.
We're not gonna make permanent camp here, are we?
The escarpment's a bit too big to comb end to end...
...for your cousin and her white ape friend.
So we shall have to devise some means to get them to come and visit us.
How on earth are we going to do that?
That's a matter to which I've given considerable thought.
I'll figure it out.
Supposing he does come and try and set his friends free...
...isn't he liable to be a bit unpleasant?
That's a question I shall better be able to answer by tomorrow morning.
- What do you say, Rawlins?
- I never spoke, sir.
I think we better turn in and give our little plan a chance.
- Yes. Good night, Captain Fry.
- Good night.
I'll just have a last look around with Rawlins.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Night, Rita.
- Good night.
- Is it ready?
- Ready as butter, sir.
If it's not sprung tonight, take it down by sunrise.
Yes, sir.
Governor? It was a very good idea, bringing in this cage.
All he has to do is to step in here to free this ape...
...the trap will spring and we have him.
- Rawlins, you're a genius.
Yes, sir.
- Captain Fry, do you hear what I heard?
- What did you hear?
Sounded like the cry we heard below the escarpment.
Don't you think what you both need most is a good night's sleep?
I shall have a gun tonight.
I don't want shooting.
I want to take him alive.
All right, my lad. Go on, laugh. You'll be laughing the other side of your face soon.
You're just bait.
That's what you are, bait.
Rawlins, catch it.
Well, that seems to work all right.
Of course, sir, you'll post sentries around here in every direction.
What, and scare him off? No. Bomba will watch at the north. You do the same here.
- By the trap?
- Yes. And if he comes...
...I don't want you to move or make a sound unless anything happens.
- Anything happens?
- In which case, send for me quietly.
You took the words right out of my mouth, sir.
- You can hide in the brush down here.
- All right, sir.
I suppose I'll be quite comfortable.
Captain, there are times when I sort of get a creepy feeling...
...that he knows all about us.
- Maybe he does, Rawlins.
- Yeah...
- Good night, Rawlins.
- Goodbye, sir.
Cheetah.
Cheetah.
- Captain Fry!
- Rita, what is it?
- He was here. I saw him.
- Which way?
There, I think.
- What's happened?
- He's been here. Bomba! Bomba!
Where's that fool?
These lashings have been cut.
Rawlins! Where's that idiot?
- What the deuce are you doing there?
- Oh, Captain Fry...
...I've had a horrible, horrible experience.
That huge monster attacked me and after a fierce struggle...
...he hurled me to the ground and stamped on me.
Next time I opened my eyes, he'd turned himself into a horrible, hairy ape.
Did he spring the trap?
No, sir. That was a precaution of my own, sir.
Bomba, get the boys and round up animals!
Tarzan.
Jane.
Tarzan, let go. I'm not awake yet.
What will the neighbors think?
- Hurt?
- I'm glad you woke me.
- I was having a nightmare. I was afraid.
- Afraid?
I dreamt I was back in London in a horrible, rushing taxi.
The radio was going and I was on my way...
...to play bridge with my three maiden aunts.
Thank you for being such a horrible, kidnapping monster and keeping me here.
Jane.
Oh, just a moment.
Before you start any more of your usual blarney...
...where were you last night?
- Swim.
- Nope.
No, we won't swim.
And don't try to change the subject.
You didn't get in this morning until all hours. And you were carrying your shoes.
- Swim, swim, swim.
- No.
Cheetah.
- Where did this come from, Tarzan?
- Swim.
Tarzan, please. I've got to know.
- People.
- Yes, I know. But white people? Where?
- Swim now.
- Tarzan, I've got to see them.
- No.
- Please.
No.
Please, Tarzan.
Stay.
Stay.
Oh, what a hideous monster it was, this.
It's a wonder to me that all the hair on our heads didn't go white during the night.
As far as his looks,
I thought he was rather sweet.
Sweet, Miss Rita?
Did you get a good look at him?
He was looking at me.
Mind you now, miss. If he'd have fought fair, I'd have had him.
Oh, yes, I'd have had him. But there
I was, with just my two hands to his four.
He had a big, heavy club in each of them.
And there he come, howling at me and waving them just like...
In dealing with animals, Eric, there's one thing to always remember.
We're their superiors for two reasons.
One's self-control and the other a gun.
Well, what's the matter with you?
- Where's Miss Parker?
- Oh, Captain Fry...
Come on, speak up, man.
- That man was here again.
- Miss Parker!
Oh, it's no good, sir. It's no good.
He's appropriated her, sir.
- Which way?
- Up.
Rita!
Bomba!
- Oh, we'll never find her.
- Brace up. That sort of thing won't help.
Help? He's probably carried her clear out of the country by this time.
Rita, where are you?
I'm up here.
Rita.
- Don't worry, I'm all right.
- Isn't that Eric?
Yes, of course it's Eric.
I've found her!
- Hello, Jane.
- Hello.
- Who's the other one?
- He's the man who brought us here.
- Oh, isn't this wonderful?
- Darling, I'm so glad to see you.
Will you stop talking and come down here?
Yes, we'll be right down. That is, we will be right down, won't we?
Tarzan, take Rita down.
- Jane sorry?
- I've never been so happy...
...in my whole life.
Tarzan!
- Eric.
- Jane, darling, it's really you.
Yes, and very much alive and quite well and awfully happy.
Rich too, I hear.
- Tarzan, this is my cousin Eric.
- My cousin Eric.
How do you do?
- Jane, this is Captain Fry.
- How do you do?
How do you do?
Feels so funny.
I haven't done this for ages.
Tarzan, this is Captain Fry.
Tarzan, Tarzan.
Captain Fry is a friend too.
He helped Rita and Eric to find us.
Friend too.
Oh, he...
He likes me!
- Hey!
- Please.
Well, that's the end of that gun.
I'm sorry, Captain Fry, but Tarzan has seen guns kill.
Well, I understand his point of view.
Still, there's the matter of how I'll protect my party.
That won't be necessary, now that Tarzan's looking after you.
Well, what about lunch?
We can't run around the jungle hunting our lunch with our hands.
No. You're to be our guest.
Rita, there's no use you camping out and being uncomfortable...
...while you've got a whole house.
- House? You mean that...
Oh, this little bird's nest?
No, I mean our townhouse.
We've got lots of room.
You'll be comfortable.
Tarzan made it.
I designed the kitchen myself.
- The kitchen?
- Hot and cold water.
All the latest conveniences.
Captain Fry, tell your men to break camp.
I'll show you the way.
- Tarzan, do the marketing.
- Market.
- Yes, food for all these people.
- Food.
- And hurry back.
- Hurry back.
Now, don't keep that up all night.
Me? I'm sleeping aloft.
I'm company, I am.
And don't go having none of them there nightmares.
Now, don't you let that roast burn.
Jane, we didn't come here just to make you unhappy.
We think you owe it to yourself to come back. Until you're quite sure.
I know. I think you came because you wanted me more than my money.
- Oh, but, Jane...
- Oh, I'm not ungrateful.
No, Rita can have all the silk stockings she wants.
Eric can have his career, an enormous yellow roadster to drive his girl about in.
- There is a girl?
- Oh, naturally.
I'd like to meet her.
- Eric, couldn't I just sign a paper or...?
- No, Jane.
I think Uncle wanted to leave all his money to his frightful museum.
You were a matter of conscience.
Otherwise, the will could never impose so many obstacles.
Of course, if Tarzan would let me go...
I must ask you to say nothing to Tarzan...
...until I've had a chance to tell him my own way.
I want him to know why I'm going and how soon I'm going to be back.
Jane, why not bring Tarzan with you?
- Back to London?
- Yes, of course!
If you like it, you could spend half your time here and half your time there.
No, Rita.
Out here, Tarzan's a king.
How do I know what he'd be back there?
Perhaps, at first, sort of a freak. And then, as he learnt more about civilization...
...he'd realize he was dependent on his rich wife.
He'd never tolerate that.
Or if he did, it might be even worse.
Oh, Miss Parker, this looks like your lord and master coming now.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- No, I meant, "How are you?"
- All right.
You were away so long.
Aren't they beautiful this year?
- Oh, and these are ripe too.
- Eat?
- As soon as we get some water, darling.
- Miss Parker!
Miss Parker!
- What is it, Rawlins?
- I don't think this animal likes me.
- Perhaps you're not using the right word.
- Oh, blimey.
No, that might be it.
Here, you.
Going up.
All aboard.
Oh, go on now, will you?
I'd do the same for you one day.
Alley-up!
Now, whatever you do, don't let go,
Ongali. Or whatever your name is.
Offhand, roast beef, I should say.
Make yourself useful in the kitchen,
Rawlins.
Yes, sir.
- Could I be of any service?
- Yes.
- Tarzan, show him how to get water.
- Water.
Now, this is very, very clever.
- Did all this come out of your own head?
- Head?
I mean the idea, not the water.
Water.
Oh, Cheetah, you might turn on that fan for a while, will you?
Dinner, everyone. Dinner.
- Oh, I'm ready.
- What ho!
Supposing you try and wait on us without getting your thumbs in the soup.
Here's my contribution.
Don't blame me if it's carrots.
It's not carrots. It's very good, even if I don't know the name.
Eric, stop it.
Now, Rita, you sit here, Captain Fry,
Eric, over there.
- Tarzan will carve.
- Is there anything Tarzan can't do?
Matter of fact, he's clever at almost everything.
Aren't you, Tarzan?
I say, look at the size of that roast.
No soup.
- Eat now.
- Oh, I second the motion.
You have some tribes on the escarpment?
Yes, indeed.
Awful savages they are too.
They must give you trouble, don't they?
No, the most powerful tribe of all...
...lives about a day's safari west of here.
But Tarzan is such a juju to them they leave us alone.
They don't even harm the animals.
But they'd be pleased if we were to clear off...
...and leave this whole hunting ground to them.
You don't have contact with the natives?
I mean, they don't speak any known language.
We leave them alone too.
But natives everywhere manage to understand each other somehow.
Yes, that's true.
Miss Parker...
Thank you, Cheetah.
No, now, greedy.
Here, take this outside.
Go on.
Her table manners aren't all they should be.
Oh, I'm very much obliged.
Yes, thank you.
Listen to me.
I want you to understand...
...that any attempt at familiarity is very much resented. Thank you.
- Miss Parker, I've been thinking...
- Hey, old Fry's been thinking.
It's no concern of mine, but I overheard you when you discussed it.
I've found a solution about what to do with Tarzan when you go to England.
- Please, Captain Fry...
- Go?
No, you haven't heard me out.
My idea is not to leave him.
Take him with you.
No need for him to be dependent. I'll offer him a contract that'll make him fortune.
- You mean, put Tarzan on exhibition?
- Nothing like that.
He could lecture on wildlife and handle wild animals as never before.
What do you say? Come to England.
You'll be a sensation.
Captain Fry, my cousin particularly wished that this shouldn't be mentioned.
Oh, I am sorry. I had no idea it was supposed to be a secret.
- Secret? Jane go?
- Hold on, Tarzan. This wasn't Jane's idea.
There's a paper at home that Eric and I must have signed.
Otherwise, we'll lose a lot of money if Jane doesn't help us.
- Money?
- Yes, Tarzan, money.
You know, to get clothes and food and...
Food, clothes...
...money?
- No, Tarzan, you don't understand.
- Money isn't that, it's...
- Of course he doesn't understand!
I hope he never does.
- Secret.
- No, Tarzan. No.
Jane go?
Jane people go?
Only if you're willing...
...not if it's going to cause you the least bit of unhappiness.
Tarzan!
Cheetah.
Tarzan, Tarzan.
Jane no happy?
How shall I tell you, darling?
I love Tarzan.
Tarzan is Jane's love.
Like the stars over the night, like the air to breathe.
Tarzan makes me alive, but Eric and Rita are my friends.
Friends, like rain at the end of the summer...
...like the wind moving the tops of the jungle.
I am yours. You are mine.
But I must help Rita. She is my friend.
Friend, as Tarzan was Cheetah's friend...
...to help her when she was in the trap.
- Trap?
Yes, trap.
No, darling, not a real trap...
...but just as strong, just as horrible.
Jane want go?
Don't you remember how you went when
Timba was in the pit the tribes had dug?
Jane want go?
Tarzan, believe me...
...when the moon has made safari three times...
...three times, and when she comes out of the river, big and round...
...and looks in on us here, she'll find us as we are now.
Together.
And my safari will be over forever.
And I will never go away again.
Tarzan...
...and Jane.
Understand?
Understand.
Bravo, Rawlins!
Now let's see you strangle a lion.
- I'm going with you.
- Jane, darling!
But first, I want today with Tarzan alone.
- We need that for saying goodbye.
- Yes, of course...
...but couldn't we go back to our old camp and leave this to you?
No, Tarzan and I have a little Garden of Eden up the river.
He's already gone there ahead to wait for me.
- I'll be ready first thing in the morning.
- Tomorrow morning?
- You wanted to get away, didn't you?
- That's right.
Of course.
Don't mind their laughing at you.
I was much worse than you are when I started.
Practice never made anybody perfect like he is, miss.
I believe you think more of Tarzan than all the others do.
Miss Jane, he's the finest gentleman
I ever knew...
...trousers or no trousers.
- Thank you.
Tarzan would be proud of that.
- I'd better get the natives started packing.
- No hurry.
- Hadn't I better get the cage down?
- No, I'm leaving that here.
There'll be no stopping for gorillas on the way.
We have no other use for it now, have we?
No, sir. But it's a very valuable piece of merchandise.
What you sent all the way to Birmingham for.
Go and see the boys have no thorns in their feet for tomorrow.
Yes, sir.
- And send Bomba to me.
- Yes. Bomba!
Captain Fry wants you.
Bomba, listen.
Out west where sun go down, great tribe.
For safari, one day.
Bomba move fast, half day.
- Take boy and find chief.
- How find chief?
You'll find him, all right.
What's the matter, you afraid?
- Bomba no afraid.
- Good.
Tell chief bwana send.
Bwana want chief for friend.
Bwana want warriors to get through Gaboni country.
Want spears, canoe, food.
Bwana great, good friend of chief.
- What bwana give chief?
- Tell chief bwana take away juju.
Take away great white ape.
Tell chief bwana send one white man, two white women for juju.
Well, get along there.
Yes, bwana.
You're sending Bomba on ahead,
Captain Fry?
Yes. It's always a good idea to scout out the country one intends to go through.
- Oh, that was lovely.
- Cold.
- Oh, it was not.
- Hot.
- It was just right.
- Just right?
Just right.
Tarzan, stop!
Tarzan, don't. I'm tired.
Tarzan, I'll fall on my face.
Cheetah!
Cheetah, stop it.
Cheetah.
Don't you behave yourself for one minute?
Go on. Go on home.
Go on home.
Yes, and it'll serve you right if she tells her mother everything that's happened.
Tarzan?
Tarzan?
Tarzan!
Very well, then. Doesn't make any difference to me where you are.
You see? I found you.
You can't get away from me.
I wouldn't squeal if this was the tallest tree in Africa...
...and there were 10,000 lions below.
I squealed.
- Jane.
- Darling...
...I love you so much.
Jane.
Yes, Tarzan. Forever...
...and ever.
Thank you, darling.
- You see chief?
- Yes, bwana. Chief say he do.
- Get spears, canoes, everything?
- Yes, bwana.
- Get the men together.
- Yes, bwana.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Jane, where's Tarzan?
He's not coming.
He didn't want to say goodbye.
Is there anything you'd like to get before we leave?
No. Nothing.
Jane, darling.
I know just how you must be feeling.
I'm all right.
Wouldn't you like to go and say goodbye...
...to your lovely little house just for a minute?
No.
I'd much rather not.
Miss Parker, join the main group with Rawlins.
I'll be on the right flank with a few men, and Bomba will be on the left.
We must take every precaution.
Cheetah.
Goodbye, Cheetah.
Look after Tarzan when I'm gone.
- You tired, Jane?
- At this pace?
Through the trees,
I could be back with Tarzan in an hour.
I'm sorry.
Isn't it odd we haven't heard from Captain Fry?
Yes, isn't it?
- Do you suppose we lost our way?
- Oh, no, miss.
No, if we had gone off a straight line, we'd have run into Bomba or Captain Fry.
On second thoughts,
I think I'll look around a bit.
Take good care of your sister and Miss Jane, sir.
- Why, Rawlins, you talk as though...
- Cheerio, sir.
Bomba?
You idiot, don't you understand you're heading the wrong way?
- Way.
- Why, you're barmy.
- Now, face about and join the rest.
- Bwana say go.
- You're lying.
- Bwana, he go.
Oh, he did, did he?
Now, suppose you just tell me what he went back for.
Bwana no say.
Well, I know anyhow.
Bomba, you can't do it.
Now, chuck Fry and, so help me...
...when we get home,
I'll give you a new 5 pound note.
I've got one.
So help me, I have, Bomba.
Bomba!
You can't go and help Fry put him in a cage.
Bwana, he say do.
Oh, he did, did he? Well, he won't!
You just wait until Tarzan comes leaping and roaring at you...
...and tear all your beast heads off.
Where were you going, Rawlins?
Captain Fry.
- Fancy meeting you here.
- Yes, we both seem to have strayed a bit.
- You were going back, Rawlins?
- Who, me, sir?
Oh, yes, sir. I was just going back to get something...
...what I forgot while I was packing, sir.
- What thing?
- What?
Well, you mean, what thing what I forgot, sir?
Well, come along, then.
- Oh, a locket, sir.
- Oh, a locket.
Yes, sir. A small, gold locket, sir.
Oh, it's very valuable, sir.
- A picture in it.
- With a picture?
Yes, sir. My mother, sir.
- Well, cheerio, sir.
- You've told me a dozen times...
...you were practically born in an orphan asylum.
Well, I was, sir. But you see, as orphans, sometimes, sir, we...
We like to have a picture that we can pretend that it's our mother, sir.
Oh, this one was a very jolly-Iooking old lady, sir.
Snow-white hair, sir.
I picked her up cheap, sir.
Fifteen bob at a secondhand shop in Whitechapel, sir.
I shouldn't go, Rawlins.
It might be dangerous.
Yes, sir. But all the same, sir,
I think I'd better go, sir.
It will be dangerous, Rawlins.
Yes, sir.
- Tarzan, I've got a message.
- Jane?
Yes. Bad news, I'm afraid.
I sort of hate to tell you this, but she's not coming back. Ever.
Tarzan, she couldn't tell you herself.
She asked me to tell you.
Oh, I'm sorry, Tarzan, but you see...
There's not much good talking, is there?
Goodbye.
Oh, Tarzan.
Do you know any remedy for a poisonous snakebite?
You know, snake.
One of my safari boys.
Where boy?
Thanks. I'll show you.
Bomba! Bomba! Here, you fools!
Use your spears!
That was very generous of you, Tarzan.
Oh, I'm...
I'm ashamed of myself.
- I'll tell the others.
- Others?
Well, after all...
Tarzan, try and not think too much about Jane.
- Jane.
- Well, you've a right to know the truth.
Jane knew about this.
I tell you, she knew about it!
Jane.
Jane want Tarzan in trap.
Bomba, we've got him!
Come out, you fools!
He's safe now.
Have Abdul tell the Hymandis chief we're on our way.
Tell him we've got great white ape.
Come on, get him up!
Captain Fry, isn't this rather an unusual way of making a safari?
- Unusual? In what way?
- With Rawlins back there all those hours...
...wouldn't an advance guard be more practical?
I have my own fussy way of doing things.
The boys seem to be nervous about being in a strange country.
Bomba! Push them along there.
Hymandis.
Bomba.
Keep your nerve, everybody.
Tell them want to see chief.
Stay where you are and don't let them see that you're nervous.
Bwana come.
Tell chief bwana glad to be friend.
Chief say glad bwana come.
Get him one of those bags of salt.
Tell chief give now spears, meat, canoes.
Tell chief bring white men, two white memsahibs for juju.
Tell the chief I've got the great white ape.
Chief say bwana no got white ape.
He got white ape.
Tell chief I make juju.
Chief say he make juju.
Tarzan!
Tarzan!
Timba.
Timba.
Cheetah.
Tarzan, I knew you'd come.
Don't move before Tarzan gives the signal.
- Did you hurt your arm, Rita?
- No, it's my leg.
- Tarzan, make a litter.
- Litter?
I'm all right, only a twisted knee.
Don't walk. It'll be just as quick to carry you on a litter.
Come on, Mr. Parker.
We'll hold them as long as we can.
- Hurting?
- A bit.
Captain Fry, come on.
Quick!
What did Tarzan mean by "ungatowa"?
We're escaping through the cave where the swamp makes smoke.
It's juju, forbidden.
They'll never follow.
This is the first time in Africa I haven't been able to see some sign of a bird.
Thank heaven we're out at last.
You can't let him do this.
Tarzan.
Well, haven't I the right to be heard?
Escarpment.
This is our way. The escarpment slopes gradually here.
There are no savage tribes, nothing to trouble you going home.
Going home.
How nice that sounds.
Tarzan.
Tarzan?
He's gone back.
Yes, of course he's gone. What are we waiting for? Let's get the men together.
- Bomba, safari.
- Bomba, wait.
We've hardly got time as it is to make camp before dark.
- We can't do this to you any longer.
- Rita, we've got to go.
We lied to you about going back.
You don't have to.
I appreciate what you're doing, but let's go.
My dear, it's true.
Can you still write, darling?
Because they'll accept your signature.
And that's all we're taking back with us.
Listen, there's something you've got to understand and try and forgive.
You see, we wanted to take you back to where we thought you belong.
"Civilization," I think they call it, but it's not for you.
And even if your coming back meant that I'd inherit the world...
...I couldn't forget the look in Tarzan's eyes when he thought he would lose you.
Stay here with your jungle flies...
...your funny little Cheetah and all the trouble she gets into and Tarzan.
You've got the grandest possessions that any woman can have.
Peace and comradeship...
...and perfect communion with a man who's devoted...
...to making your life beautiful.
Don't you ever lose it.

KING SOLOMON'S MINES--          
LIKE MANY OTHERS, WELL...       
I DIDN'T BELIEVE IN THEM.       
IN THOSE DAYS, AFRICA WAS A     
LAND OF MANY ROMANTIC LEGENDS.  
IT HAD A VAST,                  
UNEXPLORED INTERIOR.            
I WAS A HUNTER AND IT WASN'T    
UNTIL THE YEAR 1881             
THAT I LEARNT THAT THE MINES    
WERE A STARK REALITY.           
I SAY "WERE" BECAUSE THEY       
NOW LIE BURIED UNDER A MILLION  
TONS OF ASHES AND LAVA.         
AT THE TIME I'M SPEAKING OF,    
DIAMONDS HAD BEEN               
FOUND IN KIMBERLEY.             
MANY ADVENTUROUS SPIRITS        
FROM ALL PARTS OF THE WORLD...  
    YOU'VE STRUCK               
 LUCKY AGAIN, RED.              
                     YES.       
 YOU CAN COUNT YOUR             
 MONEY TOMORROW.                
            I'LL HAVE 5 POUNDS  
             ON ACCOUNT TO      
             GET DRUNK WITH.    
         [Laughing]             
             GET YOUR BACKS TO  
             THE WALL, THE WHOLE
             BOILING LOT OF YOU.
             DON'T SHOOT, BOYS. 
             IT ISN'T A HOLD-UP.
                I'M JUST TENDING
                 MESELF AND THE 
            TREASURES OF ARABIE.
 CAST AN EYE OVER THAT,         
     ME BOY, AND SEE WHAT       
         YOU MAKE OF IT.        
             WHAT HAVE          
            YOU FOUND?          
         A HOUSE, CARRIAGE      
             AND PAIR FOR       
             ME DAUGHTER        
             AND THE LIFE OF    
             RILEY HEREAFTER    
                 AND EVERMORE.  
                    DID YOU EVER
                 SEE THE LIKE?  
A NICE PIECE OF                 
CRYSTAL, O'BRIEN,               
BUT NO DIAMOND.                 
    YOU DON'T                   
    MEAN IT?                    
I'M SORRY,                      
MISS KATE.                      
 THAT'S BAD LUCK,               
 PATRICK, BAD LUCK.             
             BAD LUCK NOTHING.  
             I WAS ONLY HAVING  
             A JOKE WITH YOU.   
                 COME ON, GIRL. 
[Donkey braying]                
         TRY AGAIN, PATSY.      
                 DEVIL I WILL.  
             I SPURN THE DIAMOND
         FIELDS UNDER ME SHOES. 
IF WE COULD ONLY GET            
TO THE COAST, I COULD           
GET A JOB TEACHING.             
         AND WOULD              
        YOU LIKE IT?            
         I WOULD NOT.           
                    [O'Brien]   
                    OF COURSE   
                 YOU WOULDN'T.  
             LISTEN, THERE WAS A
             MAN IN THE BAR LAST
         NIGHT FROM THE CONGO.  
         HE SAYS THERE'S        
         A FORTUNE IN IVORY.    
 THERE'S BEEN A FORTUNE         
IN EVERYTHING WE'VE TRIED,      
BUT IT WASN'T US                
 WHO FOUND IT.                  
FROM NOW ON, WE'LL BE DECENT,   
RESPECTABLE CITIZENS,           
AND WE'RE GOING TO THE COAST    
BEFORE I CHANGE ME MIND.        
HOW MUCH MONEY HAVE WE?         
             LESS THAN A POUND  
             AND ALL OUR TRAPS  
            ARE IN THE PAWNSHOP.
 WHAT'S THAT                    
 YOU HAVE?                      
             FOR YOU, A GIFT I  
        BOUGHT TO CELEBRATE OUR 
         MAGNIFICENT DISCOVERY. 
         A SHAMROCK!            
                     FOR LUCK.  
                     IT DIDN'T  
                 COST A THING.  
         I KNOW WHAT            
            IT COST.            
 THERE WERE TWO                 
IN MULLIGAN'S STORE.            
 HERE'S THE                     
 OTHER FOR YOU.                 
             KATHY, ME GIRL,    
             THERE WAS NEVER    
            ANYTHING TO BEAT IT.
     WITH A BIT OF SHAMROCK     
    APIECE, THERE'S NOTHING ON  
     EARTH CAN HOLD US DOWN.    
     LOOK!                      
 GLORY BE TO GOD,               
STRAIGHT FROM HEAVEN.           
ASK HIM FOR A LIFT              
TO THE COAST.                   
        IT'S A 5-WEEK JOURNEY.  
         IT'S A LOT TO ASK.     
AND YOU CALL YOURSELF           
AN IRISHMAN?                    
            IT'S A FINE MORNING.
                 [O'Brien]      
            IT'S A FINE MORNING.
         IS IT?                 
                     IT IS.     
                 ARE YOU GOING  
                 TO THE COAST?  
     NO, KITSFONTEIN.           
WELL, THAT'S ALL                
 ON THE WAY.                    
         WHOSE WAY?             
     OURS.                      
    WE WERE WONDERING           
IF YOU'D GIVE US A LIFT.        
            NO.

                 WE'RE DOWN     
             BUT WE'RE NOT OUT. 
            [Quartermain]       
        YOU'RE OUT AS FAR AS    
        MY WAGON'S CONCERNED.   
OH! SO YOU DON'T                
APPROVE OF US?                  
 I DON'T APPROVE OF TEARING     
     UP THE FACE OF THE         
     COUNTRY FOR GREED.         
ME DAUGHTER IS                  
A GOOD COOK.                    
 I HAVE A GOOD COOK.            
 ME FATHER'S A                  
 WONDER TO TALK.                
     YEAH, HE WOULD BE.         
 [Kathy]                        
AND HE'S A LOVELY               
RIFLE SHOT.                     
JUST THINK OF THE GAME          
HE COULD GET FOR YOU.           
         [Laughter]             
        WHAT'S FUNNY            
         IN THAT?               
             QUARTERMAIN, BEST  
             HUNTER IN AFRICA.  
         THAT ENDS IT.          
IT DOES NOT.                    
MR. QUARTERMAIN,                
YOU NEEDN'T TAKE US             
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO,           
 BUT HERE'S SOMETHING           
 FOR YOU TO THINK ABOUT IN      
 YOUR PRECIOUS SOLITUDE:        
 ME FATHER'S OWN SISTER         
 IS DYING IN KILKENNY           
 AND IF THEY NEVER MEET         
 THIS SIDE OF THE GATES,        
     'TIS YOU THAT WILL         
     HAVE PREVENTED THEM.       
            JUMP UP.            
     ¶[Spiritual singing]       
         HOW MUCH LONGER?       
ANOTHER 10 DAYS.                
 LOOK!                          
                 [Kathy]        
        AH, THE PRETTY CREATURE.
YOU STARTLED HER.               
                 MAYBE SHE KNOWS
                 THAT IN 10 DAYS
             YOU'LL BE AFTER    
                HER WITH YOUR   
             MURDERING GUNS.    
I'LL GET YOU                    
 A KNIFE.                       
 YOU DON'T                      
 LIKE HUNTING?                  
             NO, I DO NOT.      
         NEITHER DO I.          
     THEN WHAT DO YOU HUNT FOR? 
A LIVING. IT PAYS ME            
TO RUN HUNTING TRIPS.           
     I'VE GOT 2                 
    CLOWNS WAITING              
     FOR ME NOW.                
     THERE MUST BE A LOT        
     OF MONEY IN HUNTING.       
 I'VE BEEN THINKING OVER WHAT   
 THAT FELLA SAID ABOUT IVORY.   
                    HAVE YOU HAD
                 ANY EXPERIENCE 
             IN TRACKING GAME?  
HE ONCE TOOK PART               
IN A BADGER HUNT,               
BUT THE BADGER ESCAPED.         
        YOU DON'T KNOW          
        WHAT YOU CAN DO         
         TILL YOU TRY.          
     WHILE YOU'RE TRYING,       
     YOUR POOR SISTER'S         
     PEACEFULLY PASSING         
     AWAY IN KILKENNY.          
    ALAN QUARTERMAIN, IT WAS A  
 LIE ABOUT ME FATHER'S SISTER.  
             I KNOW, I'VE MET   
             THE IRISH BEFORE.  
         I'M GLAD YOU OWNED UP. 
                     AND WHY    
                 SHOULDN'T SHE? 
                 SHE'S GONNA    
             SETTLE DOWN AND    
                 TEACH SCHOOL.  
         YOU'RE GOING           
         TO SETTLE DOWN?        
OF COURSE                       
I AM.                           
I SUPPOSE THERE ISN'T ANYTHING  
 IN THE IVORY TRADE IS THERE?   
 IF YOU ASK ME, THERE ISN'T A   
 PIN TO CHOOSE BETWEEN YOU.     
                 THERE'S A WAGON
             ACROSS THE RIVER.  
         NO. ANTELOPE           
            PROBABLY.           
 I'M SURE                       
IT'S A WAGON.                   
                     CAN'T BE.  
AND WHY NOT?                    
                THERE'S NOTHING 
                 ACROSS THAT    
             RIVER BUT DEVILS.  
                 THAT'S WHAT    
             THE NATIVES SAY.   
         IT'S UNEXPLORED LAND,  
         DESERT PROBABLY.       
IT MAY BE THE DEVIL'S,          
BUT I CAN SEE A WAGON.          
            COME ON!            
         [Shouting]             
    TAKE THIS.                  
    WATER, QUICK!               
WHOSE WAGON IS THIS?            
            HE'S NOT            
         ABLE TO TALK.          
IT'S THE                        
DESERT.                         
     INSIDE.                    
        [Man whispering]        
 [Shouting in foreign language] 
THAT'S ALL RIGHT,               
THEY'RE LOOKING                 
AFTER HIM.                      
     THE OTHERS RAN AWAY IN     
     THE NIGHT MANY DAYS AGO.   
     THE FEAR WAS ON THEM.      
        SURE, THE DEVIL.        
                HE FELL ILL.    
                WE COULD NOT    
             REACH THE NORTH.   
HELP HIM                        
BACK TO CAMP.                   
                I TURNED BACK.  
             HE DOES NOT KNOW.  
             LET ME GO ON.      
            OUT OF THE WAY.     
YOU CAN'T GO ON.                
YOU ARE ILL.                    
     DO I CARE IF I AM ILL?     
I DON'T KNOW WHERE              
YOU'RE GOING BUT--              
     YOU WANT TO KNOW WHERE     
    I'M GOING BUT I TELL YOU,   
     YOU CANNOT FOLLOW.         
         I CROSSED THE DESERT.  
        AFTER THE DESERT, I FIND
        KING SOLOMON'S MOUNTAIN.
         AFTER THE MOUNTAIN,    
    I FIND KING SOLOMON'S MINES.
                     DIAMONDS.  
             SYLVESTRA, WHEN    
            YOU SEE ME AGAIN,   
         I'LL BE THE RICHEST    
             MAN ON EARTH.      
             SO, OUT OF THE WAY!
        [Mumbling incoherently] 
                    [Gasping]   
DID YOU HEAR THAT?              
THE MINES OF KING               
SOLOMON OVER THE DESERT.        
         IS IT TRUE?            
                 TRUE, WE HAVE  
             HEARD OF THE MINES.
         [Quartermain]          
     GET ME SOME WATER.         
             [Speaking Kukuana] 
 ALL THE JEWELS OF OPHRAH       
 AND NO ONE EVER DISCOVERED     
     WHERE OPHRAH WAS.          
THAT'S WHERE                    
IT IS MAYBE.                    
         [Quartermain]          
            KATHY! MY           
         MEDICINE CHEST.        
                    ALL RIGHT.  
     [Speaking Kukuana]         
     WHAT'S THAT YOU HAVE?      
         A MAP.                 
     LOOK, 300                  
     YEARS OLD.                 
 HE SAID A MAN                  
 WENT THERE AND                 
NEVER CAME BACK.                
 LOOK, THE WAY                  
ACROSS THE DESERT               
AND HERE, KING SOLOMON'S        
MOUNTAIN AND THE MINE.          
THE JEWELS OF OPHRAH,           
THE GREATEST TREASURE           
IN THE WORLD!                   
 NOW, THAT MAP IS HIS.          
     YOU HAD NO RIGHT           
         TO TAKE IT.            
I KNOW, BUT IF HE               
LIVES WE WON'T USE IT,          
AND IF HE DOESN'T,              
I'LL SEEK THE TREASURE          
MESELF AND I'LL HAVE            
MASSES SAID FOR HIS SOUL.       
THE SHAMROCK! I SAID

 KATHY ASLEEP?                  
     IT MUST BE TERRIBLE TO     
     DIE ALONE IN THE DESERT    
         WITHOUT YOUR FOLKS.    
 TERRIBLE.                      
WHAT DID YOU                    
THINK OF THE MAP?               
        HOW DID YOU GUESS?      
     I KNOW HUMAN

 TREASURE'S CONCERNED.          
         WHERE'S THE HARM?      
         I RETURNED IT.

BESIDES, HE HAS NO FOLKS.       
        HAVE YOU LOOKED OVER IT?
     DO YOU THINK IT'S GENUINE? 
IT'S UNEXPLORED COUNTRY.        
NOBODY KNOWS.                   
     YOU'RE LOOKING AT A MAN

                 I'M HER FATHER,
                 NOT A MURDERER.
             I SHALL GO ALONE.  
        IN ALL ME LIFE, I MAY

            TO TAKE OUR TROUBLES
     WITH A SMILE IN OUR TEETH

     TO BE A CAPABLE            
        YOUNG PERSON.

 SHE'D HAVE STOLEN ONE          
 OF MY WAGONS IF I HADN'T       
    KEPT ME EYES OPEN.

         ANYTHING WRONG?        
        I TAKE IT IT'S IN ORDER

             YOU'RE THE VICTIM  
             OF A WOMAN'S WILES.
WE MUST GO                      
AFTER HER.                      
             WE CERTAINLY MUST. 
             MY ONLY TOOTHBRUSH 
             IS IN THAT WAGON.  
 SHE HAS 3 HOURS START.         
 IT'LL BE 2 DAYS BEFORE         
     I GATHER A TEAM.           
 SHE TOLD ME THOSE BOYS

 I'M AFRAID, SIR HENRY,         
 THAT IT'S MISS O'BRIEN

     [Quartermain] YOU'RE 9     
    MILES NORTH OF THE HILL,    
     HEADING FOR THE DESERT,    
         IN A STOLEN            
             WAGON.             
         AND WHAT'S LEFT        
         OF MY TROUSERS.        
         [Quartermain]          
         YOU'RE COMING          
         BACK TOMORROW.         
MEANWHILE, COMMANDER            
GOOD WOULD LIKE                 
HIS TOOTHBRUSH.                 
             YES.               
        IF YOU WEREN'T A GIRL,  
             I'D GIVE YOU THE   
         HIDING OF YOUR LIFE.   
         ASHAMED OF YOURSELF?   
    BUT I'D DO IT AGAIN.        
             READY TO           
             COME BACK?         
     I'M NOT                    
    COMING BACK.                
I MADE UP ME MIND               
TO GO AFTER ME FATHER           
AND I'M GOING.                  
     NOT IN MY WAGON.           
             I DON'T WANT YOUR  
             WAGON ANYMORE.     
     YOU CAN'T TAKE A WAGON     
     OVER THE DESERT BECAUSE    
    YOU CAN'T TAKE ANY OXEN.    
     WHY?                       
                    BECAUSE THEY
                 DRINK TOO MUCH.
WHO TOLD YOU THAT?              
 I DID,  INKOOSI.               
         WHAT ARE YOU           
         DOING HERE?            
                     [Kathy]    
                 I BROUGHT HIM. 
LOOK, KATHY, I DON'T KNOW       
     WHAT THIS MAN'S            
    BEEN TELLING YOU,           
         BUT I GIVE YOU         
     MY WORD NO ONE CAN         
     CROSS THAT DESERT.         
             HOW DOES           
         THE  INKOOSI  KNOW?    
    I'M GONNA TRY.              
    I'M NOT AFRAID.             
THE  INKOOSIKAS                 
IS READY.                       
         I'M IN CHARGE          
     HERE. CLEAR OUT!           
     WAIT, WE CAN'T             
     LET THESE 2                
        GO ALONE,               
             BUT WHY            
         SHOULDN'T WE           
         GO WITH THEM?          
                GOOD SUGGESTION.
             SOLVES THE PROBLEM.
        I WON'T HAVE IT.        
            NOBODY'S ASKING YOU.
I THOUGHT YOU WANTED            
TO GO HUNTING.                  
             YOU KNOW, HUNTING, 
     FISHING, ANYTHING WITH A   
        LITTLE ADVENTURE IN IT. 
DO YOU KNOW HOW MEN             
DIE FOR LACK OF WATER?          
THIRST, BURNING THIRST          
THAT TURNS TO PAIN.             
TORTURE, THEN                   
YOU GO MAD                      
AND THE SUN                     
KILLS YOU.                      
                     IMAGINATIVE
             FELLOW, ISN'T HE?  
                QUARTERMAIN.    
            I'M SORRY OUR TRIP'S
         HAD TO END LIKE THIS.  
     HOW DO YOU                 
     MEAN "END"?                
                 WE'LL BE AWAY  
                 FOR SOME TIME. 
                CAN'T ASK YOU   
             TO WAIT FOR US.    
 SIR HENRY CURTIS,              
I WAS ENGAGED TO                
TAKE YOU UPCOUNTRY              
AND TO BRING YOU                
BACK TO THE BEST                
OF MY ABILITY.                  
I HAPPEN TO BE A                
MAN WHO RESPECTS                
A CONTRACT.                     
I'M LINING                      
UP WITH THE                     
REST OF YOU.                    
                YOU'RE A GOOD   
            FELLOW, QUARTERMAIN.
ON THE CONTRARY,                
I'M A FOOL.                     
    HOW ARE YOUR FEET?          
                     ALL RIGHT. 
                 HOW ARE YOURS? 
         FINE.                  
     NICE ABOUT OUR FEET,       
            ISN'T IT?           
         ARE YOU REALLY GOING   
             ALL THROUGH THIS   
            JUST FOR DIAMONDS?  
 THE  INKOOSI                   
    SAYS SO.                    
     I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.     
         I'M ASKING YOU.        
     WHY IS                     
  INKOOSI  GOING?               
                 BLESSED IF     
                     I KNOW.    
                 YOU'RE NOT ONE 
                    FOR A BIT OF
                GOSSIP, ARE YOU?
         THE MOUNTAINS DON'T    
             SEEM TO GET ANY    
             NEARER, DO THEY?   
         NO, THEY DON'T,        
                 DO THEY?       
                 NO--NO, THEY-- 
                 NO, THEY DON'T.
                 FEELING BETTER?
 MUST YOU KEEP                  
 ON ASKING ME?                  
                     I NEEDN'T. 
 I'D SURE MISS IT               
 IF YOU DIDN'T.                 
 HOW LONG WILL                  
 THE WATER LAST?                
                 TOMORROW.      
     IF I--                     
 IF I DON'T GET                 
 ANOTHER CHANCE,                
 I'M SORRY ABOUT                
 EVERYTHING.                    
WHAT ARE THOSE                  
BIRDS UP THERE?                 
                     [Umbopa]   
ASSVOGELS.                      
THEY MUST BE TO LIVE            
IN A PLACE LIKE THIS.           
                    WE CALL THEM
                 "THE BIRD THAT 
                 SMELLS DEATH." 
 HUH? OH.                       
 GOOD! COME HERE.               
                O'BRIEN'S WAGON.
                 GO BACK AND    
             KEEP HER TALKING.  
 FETCH THE OTHERS.              
             [Henry]            
         THAT'S THE LAST        
        RATION OF WATER.        
     HALF A BOTTLE EACH.        
THAT'S GOOD, I--                
I SEE BY THE MAP THAT           
WE OUGHT TO GET TO PAN BAD      
WATER BY MIDDAY TOMORROW.       
WHY'S IT CALLED                 
"PAN BAD WATER"?                
            BECAUSE IN 300 YEARS
         IT MAY HAVE DRIED UP.  
 OH...                          
             OH, I SEE, YES.    
         GO ON,                 
         DRINK IT.              
                 WHAT'S THE     
                 USE, CURTIS?   
        THERE'S NO POINT        
     IN HER SURVIVING US.       
         SAND! GO DOWN!         
                         RUN!   
        [Wind whistling]        
         [Wind howling]         
         I SMELL WATER.

             [Kathy]            
             NEARLY.            
     WE HAD MELONS FOR          
 BREAKFAST YESTERDAY.           
     WE DID.                    
     AND MELONS                 
     THE DAY BEFORE.            
     WE DID.                    
     I SUPPOSE WE'RE GONNA      
     HAVE MELONS TODAY?

     EVER LAY EGGS?             
 I WONDER HOW                   
 FAR ME FATHER                  
 IS AHEAD OF US?                
                    YOU SURE HE 
                 GOT THIS FAR?  
         OF COURSE I AM.        
     PATRICK O'BRIEN HAS        
     ALWAYS DONE WHAT HE        
     SET HIS MIND TO.           
             WHAT DID YOU THINK 
            ABOUT IN THE DESERT?
 SAND, MOSTLY.                  
                    DID YOU EVER
                    THINK OF ME?
             YES...             
         YOU AND                
         THE SAND.              
        I'M GLAD OF THAT BECAUSE
     YOU'RE GONNA SEE A LOT OF  
     ME IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS.  
 AM I?                          
        I'M AFRAID YOU          
        CAN'T AVOID IT.         
         YOU SEE, WE'RE IN      
     UNINHABITED COUNTRY.       
 I HATE TO CONTRADICT           
     YOU BUT,                   
            THERE'S A MAN       
         BEHIND THAT ROCK--     
 SEVERAL MEN.                   
            THEY SEEM ANXIOUS   
             TO MEET US.        
             MUCH TOO ANXIOUS.  
     [Shouting in Kukuana]      
             WHAT'S HAPPENED?   
THEY SAY, "WHAT MANNER          
OF MAN IS THIS WITH THE         
BEAUTIFUL WHITE LEGS,           
"WHO GROWS HAIR ON              
ONE SIDE OF HIS FACE            
"AND CAN PLUCK HIS EYE          
FROM HIS HEAD AND REPLACE       
IT WHERE IT GROWS?"             
             [Speaking Kukuana] 
 HE'S TELLING THEM YOU ARE      
WHITE GODS FROM THE SKIES.      
     YOU MEAN, ON ACCOUNT       
            OF MY LEGS?         
            I NEVER THOUGHT     
         THEY WERE AS GOOD      
             AS ALL THAT.       
             [Speaking Kukuana] 
HE COULDN'T HAVE DONE           
THAT BETTER IF HE'D             
BEEN AN IRISHMAN.

             I HOPE I'M RIGHT   
                ABOUT THE TIME.

COME ON!                        
TOO BAD THAT WHEN               
WE GET TO A FORTUNE             
IN DIAMONDS,                    
THE MOUNTAIN                    
SHOULD DECIDE                   
TO SIT DOWN ON IT.              
                 IT DID NOT,    
                     THEN.      
                I'VE A FORTUNE  
             HERE IN ME POCKET. 
             THERE'S ENOUGH     
             HERE FOR ALL OF US.
DIAMONDS ARE NOT MUCH USE       
 WHEN YOU'RE TRAPPED            
 BEHIND SOLID ROCK.             
I DON'T WANT TO DEPRESS         
YOU ANY FURTHER,                
BUT I THINK THERE'S             
GOING TO BE AN ERUPTION.        
THAT FALL OF                    
ROCK, YOU KNOW?                 
VOLCANOES ARE                   
NERVOUS THINGS,                 
IT TAKES VERY LITTLE            
TO UPSET THEM.                  
         [Explosions]           
     IF IT WASN'T FOR ME,       
YOU'D BE QUIETLY SHOOTING       
     GAME IN THE SOUTH.         
                 AND THEN YOU'D 
                 HAVE GONE HOME 
     AND MARRIED SOME NICE GIRL 
    AND LIVED IN YOUR BIG HOUSE.
AND SLOWLY GROWN                
OLD AND FAT AND                 
DISAGREEABLE,                   
AND ENDED UP A FEEBLE           
OLD MAN WITH NO ONE             
SORRY TO SEE YOU GO.            
NO, I'D RATHER                  
DIE YOUNG.                      
                STRANGE, I USED 
                 TO HATE DYING. 
        I'D LIE AWAKE AT NIGHT  
     THINKING ABOUT IT, SCARED. 
     BUT WHEN YOU COME TO IT,   
     IT'S NOT SO BAD AFTER ALL. 
         [Rumbling]             
         [Explosions]           
                THERE'S ONLY    
                ONE THING I'M   
                SORRY ABOUT.    
             I'D LIKE TO HAVE   
             SEEN IRELAND AGAIN,
             THE GLEN OF ARMAGH 
             WHERE I WAS BORN,  
         WITH THE MOUNTAINS     
             RUNNING DOWN       
             TO THE LAKES.      
             WE WERE TO HAVE    
            GONE HOME NEXT YEAR.
                 YOU COULD HAVE 
                 COME WITH US.  
            [Umbopa]

GOOD IDEA BUT--                 
IT--IT'S BOUND

                 UMBOPA?        
             [Umbopa]           
         CURTIS, WE MUST        
         PUSH IT CLEAR.         
                     READY?     
                         RIGHT. 
         [Umbopa]               
            READY?              
                     THIS TIME. 
     IT'S GONNA ERUPT!          
                 STEADY.        
                GOT HIM?        
         [Rumbling]

WILL LEAD YOU                   
ACROSS THE DESERT.

 AND AT TIMES, REMEMBER HOW     
     WE STOOD SHOULDER TO       
 SHOULDER IN THE GREAT BATTLE.

{4401}{4455}Well, Roy, you seem|to like my country.
{4456}{4522}Like it?|I think it's marvelous.
{4524}{4595}Say, I wish we were|staying here two years|instead of just two weeks.
{4597}{4669}But you know, Karl,|it does sound funny hearing you|call it "your country. "
{4671}{4717}I keep forgetting|you're not English.
{4719}{4802}Oh, sometimes I...|Well, I feel almost English myself.
{4804}{4882}Well, that's natural.|After all, you can't be|at Oxford three years...
{4884}{4941}without feeling|slightly British.
{5301}{5356}I wish Helen were here.

{5797}{5872}That brother of yours,|he's a naughty boy,

{5922}{5968}He has a way with them,|hey, Gretchen?

{6152}{6263}Yes. I don't know why|he wants to mess about|with every woman he meets.
{6265}{6335}Yeah, but you have Helen.
{6337}{6397}I'm not at all sure.
{6399}{6482}I'm not half good enough|for her.|She must be a wonderful girl.
{6484}{6567}Oh, she is.|She's marvelous.

{6616}{6703}- I'd like to.|- Would you like to see|what she looks like?
{6705}{6802}Yes. I didn't know|you had a photograph of her.|Yeah, and neither does Helen.
{6804}{6871}I took it myself|when she wasn't looking.|Really?
{6978}{7024}Oh.|Stunning, isn't she?
{7026}{7067}Why, she's marvelous.
{7202}{7248}Cheerio, you blighters.
{7250}{7296}Hello, it's Monte.
{7298}{7355}Meet the countess.|Step up, gents,|to the one and only...
{7357}{7403}Now, Monte, don't, please.|Oh, it's all right.
{7405}{7454}This little pretzel|doesn't understand|a word of English.|No?
{7456}{7518}Gretchen!|Ja!
{7689}{7752}Found her at the museum.
{7754}{7831}Yeah, she's a work of art,|all right.|You should have left her there.
{8054}{8131}Shh! Quiet!
{8171}{8217}I say, Monte, why do you|bring around this sort?
{8219}{8313}Bring her?|Good heavens,|I can't get rid of her.
{8352}{8407}Go home, will you?|Go home.
{8495}{8542}You see, I'm stuck.
{8544}{8610}Hello. Who's the dowager?|That's Helen.
{8612}{8695}Oh.|But, of course, that's only a snapshot.|Wait till you meet her.
{8728}{8778}{y:i}Oh, yeah?|Yeah.
{8780}{8835}Go away!
{8900}{8983}I say.|This is getting serious.|I've got to get rid of her.
{8985}{9058}Oh, you know, I have|a very important engagement|in just 15 minutes.
{9060}{9135}I say, you chaps,|be... be sporting|and take her off my hands.
{9137}{9212}But after all, Monte...|We may be sporting,|but we're not feeble-minded.
{9214}{9274}Well, you can do|what you please with her.|I'm going.
{9275}{9394}{y:i}Hey, listen, Monte...|Auf Wiedersehen.
{9515}{9561}Here, just a minute now.|Please.
{9563}{9616}Leave her to me.|I'll get rid of her.
{9618}{9683}Please. Yes.
{9685}{9736}{y:i}Ja.
{9738}{9833}{y:i}Nein. Nein. Nein. Nein.
{9835}{9914}{y:i}Roy! No! Roy!|No, carry on. Carry on.
{10408}{10503}Pretty boy,|you please me very much.
{11337}{11383}What's that?
{11436}{11555}It is nothing.|I am not at home to anyone|except my husband.
{11556}{11606}And he is away|on army business.
{11608}{11665}He will not be home for hours.
{11667}{11713}So, you see...
{12103}{12149}Charming.
{12392}{12444}But really, I-I say|you mustn't think that...
{12446}{12515}Your name?
{12517}{12587}My name is, uh,|Rutledge, sir.
{12589}{12645}You are stopping in Munich?
{12647}{12701}At the Hotel Bayrischer Hof, sir.
{12937}{13019}{y:i}My seconds|will call on you later.
{13020}{13067}But I say you...
{13068}{13151}There is nothing further|to discuss.

{13719}{13812}England? Why, we're not|going back for 10 days.
{13814}{13893}{y:i}What's wrong?
{13895}{13952}Baron Von Kranz.|Who's he?
{13954}{14006}Oh, he's just a friend of mine.|Really?
{14007}{14091}Quite a social success, aren't you?|How do you meet these barons?
{14093}{14156}Well, unfortunately,|I met this one through his wife.
{14204}{14283}And this means...|A duel.|Can you imagine it?
{14309}{14369}Running away?|Oh, don't be an ass. Roy.
{14371}{14453}You don't expect me|to go through with a farce like this.|It's the only thing you can do.
{14455}{14542}Oh, there you go again.|I suppose when a woman's no good|and her husband finds it out,
{14544}{14599}I've got to get shot,|just because it's|the honorable thing to do.
{14600}{14673}Well, what do you think|people will say?|You'll never live it down.
{14675}{14727}What do I care|what people say?
{14729}{14787}Well, you can talk|all you like, Monte,|but you can't walk out like this.
{14789}{14842}Can't I?
{14843}{14908}Good-bye.|See you at Oxford.
{15125}{15174}Hello, Roy.|Hello, Karl.
{15201}{15250}Well, what's up?|Where's Monte?
{15252}{15295}He's gone to England.
{15297}{15371}England?|Well, what's the matter?
{15422}{15476}Oh, nothing.|But I say...
{15644}{15712}Herr Rutledge?
{15782}{15828}Herr Rutledge?

{16520}{16566}What is your choice?
{16932}{16979}What is this?
{17033}{17091}Golden Aue.
{17093}{17169}Why, that's a famous|dueling place near here.
{17213}{17285}It says at 4:00|tomorrow morning.
{17287}{17337}4:00 in the morning.
{17339}{17385}Well, how did this happen?
{17427}{17523}I- I'm sorry, Karl.|I- I lost my temper|with one of your officers.
{17525}{17591}But, Roy...|Say, Karl, do you know|how to be a second?
{17943}{17990}Wait here, Roy.
{18258}{18307}{y:i}Bitte.

{20183}{20246}{y:i}Hey, will you cut it out?
{20309}{20363}Hey, did anybody|see my green socks?
{20364}{20438}{y:i}Check in the garbage.|Hello there, Roy.
{20440}{20490}Hello, Elliot.|Glad to see you.|I'm certainly glad to see you back.
{20492}{20539}Thank you.|And where's your German accent?
{20540}{20598}Well, I couldn't get it|past the Custom officials.
{20600}{20655}Oh, I say, what have|you done to your arm?
{20656}{20716}Oh, nothing.|It's just a little scratch.|I was hunting in Germany.
{20718}{20764}I'll see you at dinner?|Righto.
{20766}{20805}Good.|See you later.
{20807}{20858}Why aren't you getting dressed?|Aren't you coming to meet Helen?
{20860}{20947}{y:i}Oh, yes, but don't remind me of it.|Don't be foolish.|She expects us for tea.
{20948}{21029}{y:i}Tea?|Listen, it'll do you good|to meet a nice girl.
{21031}{21082}Oh, well, all right,|but first we've gotta get you dressed.
{21083}{21139}Say, we've gotta get him dressed.|He's going to see his girl.
{21140}{21205}{y:i}Now, now, wait a minute, now.|Listen, I've gotta have my shirt!
{21255}{21333}Wait a minute. L...|Listen, I'm old enough|to dress myself!
{21335}{21385}No, you're not.|Will you cut it out?
{21387}{21482}Say, listen, will you pl...
{21484}{21561}Will you...|Hey, my green socks!
{21968}{22031}Is Helen in?|Miss Helen|is not at home, sir.
{22032}{22100}She's expecting us.|Would you care to wait?
{22125}{22171}Yes, thank you.
{22712}{22759}Fine reception.
{22936}{22983}Oh.
{23244}{23308}Roy, maybe she's forgotten.
{23310}{23365}Not Helen.|She's not that sort.
{23367}{23413}Oh.
{23807}{23916}Roy, I feel sick.|I- I think I'd better go.
{23918}{24004}- Monte, will you sit down?|- Oh, I've got an awful headache.
{24006}{24066}{y:i}I think I'll go to the chemist|and get something for it.|Monte.
{24332}{24397}- Roy!|- Helen!
{24399}{24459}Oh, terribly sorry.|Mother's fault. Shopping.
{24461}{24517}I simply flew|My, isn't it hot?
{24519}{24590}You shouldn't have hurried so.|Oh, but I wanted to.
{24592}{24659}Roy, you've no right|to look so cool.|I'm broiling.
{24661}{24709}Feel.
{24711}{24757}Yes, you are, aren't you?
{24759}{24806}No, not one.
{24807}{24864}Well, you're so marvelous,|I- I hardly dare.
{24866}{24912}Oh, silly.
{24984}{25031}Well, that's better.
{25032}{25095}Cigarette, Roy?
{25097}{25166}I thought your brother|was coming.|Went out with a headache.
{25167}{25227}Poor boy.|It must be the heat.
{25463}{25567}{y:i}Extry, extry! All about the war!
{25936}{26017}Well, they've done it.|I never thought they would.
{26048}{26128}I still can't believe it.|Well, it must be true.|It's official.
{26130}{26175}Oh, shut up.|I'm trying to think.
{26176}{26228}It's terrible.
{26230}{26311}Karl, you won't|have to go, will you?
{26312}{26388}Me? Oh, Roy, I hope not.
{26390}{26474}Oh, they can't want me.|I'm not a soldier.
{26476}{26546}What use would I be|to them?
{26547}{26638}I couldn't... kill anyone.
{26639}{26687}They couldn't make me do that,|could they, Roy?
{26689}{26738}Oh, I think it'll all be over|in a couple of weeks.
{26769}{26871}I'm not so sure.|I wouldn't worry about it.
{26872}{26949}Then suppose|England comes in.
{26951}{27017}Why, Roy,|that'd be horrible.
{27019}{27078}I never could do that.|Why, I love England.
{27080}{27147}Oh, will you shut up?
{27149}{27244}Monte, Germany's|declared war on France.
{27270}{27335}Hmm? Oh.
{27336}{27426}Oh, Roy,|how do you spell "ecstatic"?
{27487}{27533}Hmm?
{27783}{27843}Special delivery letter|for Karl Arnstedt.
{28418}{28492}What's the matter, Karl?|Someone ill?
{28837}{28883}Karl.
{29210}{29329}May I ask the Prime Minister|if he has any information|he can give us today.
{29331}{29455}Our ambassador at Berlin|received his passport|at 7:00 last evening.
{29456}{29511}And since 11:00 last night,
{29513}{29620}a state of war has existed|between Germany and ourselves.
{29719}{29769}Seven?
{29771}{29842}What size?|A seven and a half|if you please.
{29899}{29955}I- I'm afraid it's a bit small, sir.
{29957}{30026}Move along, there.|Move along.|You'll grow into it.
{30102}{30163}Present arms!
{30165}{30226}Come on there.|Come on.
{30228}{30290}Present arms!
{30315}{30362}Give it to him,|you bloody fool.
{30363}{30443}Hey, what's wrong with you?|Sleeping sickness?
{30444}{30557}Here, here.|Let go of that gun,|you clinging vine.
{30559}{30605}Let go, do you hear?
{30607}{30680}God, you're enough|to turn a man's stomach.
{30682}{30734}Hey, you with|the fallen arches...
{30771}{30831}I've enlisted, Monte,|in the Royal Flying Corps.
{30833}{30885}You're a fool, Roy.
{30946}{31023}Really? How lovely.
{31025}{31100}My grandfather was in the guard|during the Revolution.|Oh, he was?
{31102}{31166}Oh, Roy, you look marvelous|in uniform.|Thank you.
{31167}{31214}Doesn't he?|It's ripping.
{31215}{31292}Where?|Tell me, what have you joined?|The infantry?
{31294}{31352}No, the Royal Flying Corps.|Oh, of course.
{31405}{31489}And all the misery in this world|has been caused...
{31491}{31571}by and for capitalism!
{31573}{31623}Why should we fight this war?
{31625}{31707}For capitalism?
{31708}{31759}You will die!|You will die!
{31761}{31852}{y:i}All your sons will die|for capitalism!
{31854}{31933}Down with capitalism!|Down with war!
{31935}{31991}Down with the anarchists.
{31992}{32063}{y:i}That's right.
{32459}{32539}Get back now.|Who do you think you're shoving?
{32563}{32610}There's the man|I'd like to kiss.
{32611}{32665}{y:i}What's the matter?|Afraid of a kiss?|Maybe he's yeller!
{32667}{32732}Go on, you.|Go on and fight for your country.
{32734}{32781}{y:i}Slacker!
{32783}{32820}Come on.
{33275}{33330}But really,|you don't understand.
{33331}{33397}I didn't mean to do anything.
{33399}{33462}Say, I'd rather marry the girl.
{33984}{34064}You'll never get|your wings that way.
{34066}{34120}Hi. How are you?|Oh, boy.
{34122}{34192}Say, listen, that first solo flight|certainly is a great thrill.
{34194}{34240}It certainly felt great.
{34366}{34414}I will.
{34467}{34529}{y:i}Wonder who that is out there.|That was a fine landing.
{34583}{34650}{y:i}Look at him come out of there.
{34738}{34791}Look, boys, it's Monte.
{34910}{34998}Hey, how'd it go, Monte?|Oh, great.
{35760}{35826}Well, tonight's|the night, Monte.|Yeah.
{35827}{35902}Say, listen, be more cheerful.|You have a treat in store|meeting Helen.
{35903}{35951}Must be Friday the 13th.
{35952}{36015}Gee, I-I wonder if she'll wear|her canteen uniform.
{36017}{36100}If she does,|you can count me out.|Oh, she looks stunning in it.
{36102}{36196}Who wants to be stunned?|I'm only going as a favor to you.
{36198}{36244}You and I don't like|the same kind of girls.
{36246}{36304}Hurry up, will you?
{36306}{36380}Oh, it's a waste of time|to polish these.
{36382}{36463}She'll probably step all over them|the first dance anyway.
{36495}{36541}Safer to sit it out.
{36543}{36611}Quiet little corner|and a have a chat|about votes for women.
{36652}{36687}Hello there.|Hello.
{36688}{36735}Whose window|are you warbling under tonight?
{36736}{36820}Lady Randolph's Charity Ball.|Wash your neck and come along.|Oh, but I haven't been invited.
{36822}{36906}That's all right.|I'm on the committee.|No, I don't think I'll go.
{36908}{36958}A smart boy.
{37891}{37941}I wonder where Helen is.|She should be here by this time.
{38049}{38096}How do you do, sir?
{38289}{38363}There's she is.|Don't point. It's rude.
{38365}{38411}Oh, Helen.
{38413}{38457}Roy!
{38548}{38588}Hello.|Hello, old thing.
{38590}{38636}You're frightfully late.|I was afraid you weren't coming.
{38638}{38749}Oh, Helen, this is Monte.|How do you do?
{38751}{38819}How do you do?
{38821}{38903}Well, that's done at last.
{38905}{38961}You know, you two have been|avoiding each other for weeks.
{39005}{39063}Helen, may I have|this next dance?
{39065}{39119}What? Oh, of course.
{39144}{39223}Oh, Roy, there you are.|Good evening, Lady Randolph.
{39224}{39288}I must say, you take your duties|on my committee very lightly.|I'm sorry.
{39290}{39355}Where have you been?|You've completely disarranged|my program.
{39356}{39418}There are no end of things|to be done. Helen dear,|you don't mind, do you?
{39420}{39469}Come along, Roy.|Come at once.|I'm sorry, Helen.
{39471}{39559}Uh, Monte, would you take|this next dance with Helen?
{39561}{39621}Oh, how do you do, Monte?|How do you do?|Now come along.
{39710}{39756}Well?
{40290}{40371}Ahem.|Oh. Hello, Roy.
{40373}{40468}I- I really must go and find,|uh, Jimmy Kerrigan.
{40470}{40532}He has something|most important to tell me.
{40534}{40580}I...
{40646}{40692}Who is this Jimmy Kerrigan?
{40694}{40771}Kerrigan?|I've never heard of him.
{40773}{40819}Oh.
{41166}{41222}What are you thinking of?
{41223}{41303}If you must know,|I was thinking of Monte.
{41304}{41354}Do you like him?|Yes, I like him.
{41355}{41406}He's a marvelous dancer.
{41446}{41506}Well, Monte does|all those things well.
{41616}{41679}Helen.|What?
{41681}{41727}May I?
{42183}{42253}Oh, Monte.|Oh, hello there.
{42255}{42301}Come sit down.
{42356}{42418}You having a better time|than you expected, Monte?
{42419}{42491}Marvelous. Been dancing|with a beautiful brunette,|name of Eleanor.
{42492}{42576}She's perfect.|Oh, Eleanor Madden.
{42578}{42631}You don't really think|she's beautiful?
{42633}{42702}Kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty?|Stop it.|I'm not a cat.
{42703}{42750}Yes, you are.
{42751}{42827}Well, if I'm a kitty,|I'm a thirsty kitty.
{42829}{42885}Roy dear, will you please|get me a glass of punch?
{42887}{42936}Why, of course I will.|No, I'll go, Roy.
{42938}{42984}No, I'm the committee.
{42986}{43066}You stay here|and look after this wallflower.
{43067}{43167}But really, I...|Oh, if you'd rather not...
{43169}{43235}Well, I-I didn't mean...
{43367}{43427}Don't you like wallflowers?
{43834}{43899}I shouldn't have done that.|Oh, you're not sorry, Monte.
{43901}{43963}Awfully sorry.|I had no right to.
{43965}{44029}What if I'm glad?
{44031}{44120}But what about Roy?|Isn't that my business?
{44147}{44205}I suppose so, but...|Hush.
{44323}{44396}Compliments of the committee.|Thanks awfully, Roy.
{44398}{44444}Well, has he been|properly charming?
{44446}{44515}Me?|More than charming.
{44516}{44563}Good for you, Monte.
{44597}{44643}Taste?
{45680}{45735}She loves me.|She blisters you.
{45737}{45790}It's worth it.|Is she worth it?
{45791}{45854}Depends on who she is.
{45919}{45965}- Hello.|- Hello.
{45967}{46043}Well, thank goodness Lady Randolph's|lost sight of me for a minute.
{46044}{46114}Roy, you've been|neglecting me shamefully.
{46115}{46199}Oh, I'm terribly sorry.|You see, it's this beastly committee.
{46201}{46247}Lady Randolph|won't let me alone a minute.
{46249}{46317}{y:i}Oh, Roy, there you are.|Yes, here I am.
{46319}{46415}Do you mind? Where is that list?|Would you mind finding Sir John for me?
{46417}{46524}It's about my Canteen Unit.|I must have the queen's signature.|It's so important.
{46526}{46615}My dear, why don't you|get into your uniform?|You look so pretty in it.
{46617}{46668}And, Monte, shouldn't you dance|with Mary Blunt?
{46670}{46748}Yes, why don't you?|And, Roy. Roy,|will you find Sir John?
{46750}{46802}I want you to lead|the grand dance for me.
{46803}{46850}And really,|there are so many things|you've got to do.
{46851}{46923}Yes. L-I'm terribly sorry.|Uh, back soon.
{46925}{47008}You see, those girls|have been looking for you.|But, Lady Randolph, I'm supposed to...
{47070}{47147}So, you've really joined|Lady Lizzie's Canteen Unit?
{47148}{47198}Rather.|Chance of a lifetime.
{47200}{47273}We go to France in two weeks.|Two weeks?
{47275}{47342}Well, Roy says|you're sailing the 15th.
{47391}{47442}Is that so?
{47571}{47625}Bored?
{47627}{47698}Tired.|Take me home, Monte.
{47699}{47746}Home?|It's not far.
{47747}{47828}I've taken a flat in town|near Canteen Headquarters.
{47830}{47921}But, I mean,|Roy will be quite upset|to find you gone.
{47923}{47994}That's what he gets|for being on committee.
{47995}{48082}But, really...|Very well.|I'll find someone else.
{48084}{48131}Oh, I didn't mean to be rude.
{48132}{48196}Well, come on then.
{48523}{48616}Are we here?|Well, it's number 27.
{48618}{48676}Wanna come up|for a cigarette and a drink?
{48678}{48740}Oh, really,|you must be awfully tired.|No, I'm not.
{48742}{48827}Come see my room.|I've only had a place of my own|for a week.
{48829}{48901}It's a new toy.
{48903}{48971}What a baby you are.
{48972}{49040}Alley-oop.|All right.
{49267}{49316}Well, this is jolly.
{49318}{49364}Sit down|and I'll get you a drink.
{49366}{49412}Thanks.
{49563}{49619}Say when.|Whoa.
{49620}{49667}When! When!
{50235}{50299}Would you be shocked|if I put on something more comfortable?
{50301}{50364}I'll try to survive.
{51679}{51741}Well, are you|more comfortable now?
{51743}{51800}Yes, are you?
{51835}{51882}Oh, yes.
{51915}{52019}You know, it seems strange|being here like this after hearing|Roy rave about you for months.
{52021}{52086}Does Roy rave?|Oh, rather.|He idolizes you.
{52087}{52173}Oh, I do wish he wouldn't.|It makes me feel guilty.
{52175}{52258}I can understand|his raving now.|Oh, don't be silly.
{52303}{52349}You're not a bit|like Roy, are you?
{52351}{52424}I should say not.
{52426}{52507}Roy's frightfully high-minded.|He doesn't approve of me.
{52509}{52611}He wouldn't approve of me either|if he knew what I'm really like.
{52612}{52683}Doesn't he know?|No.
{52685}{52766}When I'm with Roy,|I'm the way Roy wants me to be.
{52767}{52844}That's caddish, isn't it?|But I can't help it.
{52846}{52907}I understand.|Roy wouldn't.
{52967}{53015}May I ask you|a very personal question?
{53017}{53095}Yes.|Do you love Roy?
{53144}{53227}No, not really.|Not the way Roy|wants me to love him.
{53229}{53313}I can't. Roy's love means|marriage and children...
{53315}{53368}and never anyone but Roy.
{53370}{53434}I couldn't bear that.|I wanna be free.
{53436}{53483}I wanna be gay|and have fun.
{53484}{53570}Life's short,|and I wanna live|while I'm alive.
{53572}{53688}I know, that...|that's the way I feel too.
{53742}{53788}I...
{53860}{53907}I think I'd better go.
{53932}{53988}Must you?|I really should.
{54022}{54068}Pull.
{55507}{55566}Cold in here now,|isn't it?
{55707}{55757}Have you a match?
{56145}{56191}Why so gloomy?
{56343}{56390}God, I'm rotten.
{56391}{56440}I can't see it.
{56471}{56556}Can't you?|Well, then you're rotten too.
{56558}{56627}What do you mean?|And Roy worships you.
{56628}{56675}You!|Well?
{56676}{56755}Don't you make yourself sick...|you and Roy.
{56756}{56817}God, that's funny.|Get out of here!
{56819}{56863}Don't worry.|I can't get out fast enough.
{56865}{56914}Get out!
{56916}{56985}{y:i}And stay out!
{57380}{57423}Where have you been?
{57471}{57552}Oh, I, uh...|I stopped at a...
{57554}{57611}at a bar|after I took Helen home.
{57612}{57676}Oh.
{57678}{57735}How'd you like her?
{57736}{57780}Oh, she's all right.
{57782}{57853}Pass in a crowd, eh?
{57855}{57934}{y:i}I daresay she would.
{57935}{57993}Just what do you mean by that?
{58044}{58097}Listen, Roy, let me tell you something.|Even if it hurts.
{58099}{58147}Yes?
{58149}{58217}I wouldn't be so idealistic|about Helen if I were you.
{58219}{58273}And why not?
{58275}{58355}Well, I...|I just wouldn't, that's all.
{58357}{58423}{y:i}Well, why not?|Oh, I don't know.|Forget it.
{58425}{58474}Never mind crawling.|Out with it.
{58507}{58554}Listen, Roy, I tell you.|Women are all the same.
{58556}{58628}You look at every woman|as a barmaid.
{58630}{58677}You don't know anything|about decent women.
{58679}{58725}Oh, all right.|You know it all then.
{58727}{58774}Oh, you've said enough.|Shut up.
{60355}{60445}Karl. Karl!
{63489}{63543}Zep overhead!
{63602}{63665}- South by east.|- Righto!
{63891}{63942}Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Right.
{63968}{64035}All lights out, sir.|Lights out, quick!
{64289}{64371}{y:i}Zeppelin overhead!|Zeppelin overhead!|Everybody out!
{64373}{64429}{y:i}Hey, come on, Monte.|Zeppelin overhead.
{64431}{64477}Come on, Monte.|What's the matter with you?|Get up.
{64479}{64543}We don't all have to go.|I'm tired.|Oh, shut up.
{64545}{64626}- Come on. Let's go.|Hurry up. Come on.|- Be right with you, Elliot.
{64627}{64680}Come on, Monte. Get up.|Come on. Let's go. Hurry.|All right.
{65670}{65736}Karl...
{66743}{66789}Karl.
{67130}{67187}{y:i}Danke.
{67710}{67776}Well, so long there, Tommy.|All right, old chap.|Good luck, Elliot.
{67813}{67859}Go get 'em, Monte.|Good-bye.
{67861}{67922}Good luck, Roy.|Right.
{71525}{71619}Perfect.
{73691}{73748}Look, Roy, there she goes.
{74043}{74104}Let's go.
{76947}{76994}{y:i}Kapitän?
{77327}{77404}{y:i}Kapitän. Kapitän!
{77602}{77674}{y:i}Kapitän! Kapitän!
{81115}{81161}{y:i}Jawohl!
{84841}{84896}Hey, Roy, they've hit our motor.
{84934}{84995}Cut the gas.|We'll burn to death!
{85122}{85181}Roy!|Oh, shut up!
{86147}{86193}Well, this is a mess, all right.
{86195}{86257}Yeah, just our luck.|Lucky we weren't both killed.
{86259}{86315}Well, we're through.
{86359}{86405}{y:i}Herr Kapitän.
{87851}{87915}Look at it, Monte.|Roy, it's falling!
{88087}{88135}Look at that, Roy.|Great, isn't it?
{88374}{88422}They're done for.
{88743}{88797}Look out! Run!
{95127}{95178}Just a minute.
{95243}{95306}Why the blazes don't you|look where you're going, sir?
{95308}{95356}I'm sorry, sir.
{95358}{95434}Isn't it customary to salute|one's superior officer?
{95459}{95534}Thank you.|What is your name, sir?|Lieutenant Roy Rutledge.
{95536}{95583}Make a note of that.|Yes, sir.
{95696}{95780}{y:i}Would you like to try it|and find out?
{95852}{95932}{y:i}They are. They glisten in the sun.
{96033}{96124}What the hell you trying to do?|It took me three hours to write that.
{96126}{96206}{y:i}You're nothing but a pest anyhow.|Sit down.|Oh, don't, Bruce.
{96207}{96315}You shouldn't smoke so many.|What difference does it make?
{96317}{96393}You know it's bad for you.|Buy a chocolate, miss.
{96460}{96568}Change, miss.|Please.
{96570}{96641}That's a good boy.|What a life it would be|married to you.
{96643}{96718}Oh, you don't fancy it?|Beastly.|No smokes.
{96720}{96781}Think of all the money we'd save.|What would we spend it on?
{96783}{96875}Oh, a diamond dog collar.|For me?
{96876}{96980}No. I'd buy a muzzle for you.|You wouldn't spoil|my beautiful mustache, would you?
{96982}{97096}No. We'd keep that|in the parlor under glass.
{97173}{97241}Hello, Helen.|Oh, hello, Roy.
{97279}{97359}Roy, I'd like you to meet|Captain Redfield. Lieutenant Rutledge.
{97361}{97437}How do you do?|How do you do?
{97439}{97495}Beastly weather.|Yes, isn't it.
{97496}{97596}- You'll get used to it.|- Thanks.
{97598}{97674}Gee, it's great to see you again, Helen.|It's been four whole days.
{97676}{97723}Really?
{97750}{97819}- Have you been over long?|- Three weeks.
{97821}{97905}Oh. Three weeks.
{97969}{98018}Everything all right|up your way?|Oh, yes.
{98020}{98096}Your squadron near here?|Twenty miles up the line.
{98098}{98198}Twenty miles. That far.
{98199}{98279}- You chaps have it rather soft,|haven't you?|- Do you think so?
{98281}{98368}Well, I mean to say being able to|dash about the countryside and all that.
{98370}{98416}Wish I'd picked the R.F.C.
{98418}{98478}Well, why didn't you?|Roy.
{98503}{98571}Well, I must be going.|Oh. Don't go.
{98635}{98686}I think I'd better.
{98719}{98811}Good-bye, Helen,|and don't forget your promise.|I won't.
{98935}{99022}Who's that bag of wind?|Would you mind not talking|about my friends like that?
{99024}{99092}Oh, now, Helen, please.|Oh, you were perfectly beastly to him.
{99094}{99206}I'm terribly sorry.|Guess my nerves are a bit raw.
{99207}{99263}Things haven't been so easy|this last week.
{99265}{99333}Oh, you've been fighting?
{99335}{99422}Did you shoot down any Boche?|Yes. I managed to get a couple.
{99424}{99486}Really? How thrilling.|Tell me about it.
{99488}{99572}Well, there's really|nothing much to tell.|Three bars of chocolate, miss.
{101142}{101242}Oh, Jymes.|Oh, Jymes. Bread, Jymes.|We want bread.
{101244}{101320}{y:i}We want bread!
{101322}{101398}Coming, sir. Coming!
{101399}{101447}{y:i}Did you ever try hurrying, Jymes?
{101449}{101529}Sorry, sir, but I stopped to dig|a few of the cockroaches out of it, sir.
{101531}{101620}Well, put it down.
{101710}{101801}Well, where's the bread?|Did you ever try hurrying, sir?
{101803}{101905}Jymes, more bread.
{101907}{101990}Drown the cockroaches this time.|Yes, sir.
{102051}{102143}Jymes, what's the taste in this soup?|I can't say, sir.
{102144}{102216}{y:i}It's not soup, it's soap.|I think it's shoe polish.
{102218}{102310}Sorry, sir. Cook said the soup|was a bit weak tonight.
{102311}{102403}Maybe you taste|the disinfectant in the water, sir.|Oh.
{102479}{102559}Well, strike me blind,|it's a hair.
{102561}{102650}{y:i}Wash it off and wear it, Baldy.
{102805}{102893}Hello, you chaps.|Hello, Monte. How goes it?
{103020}{103100}Still no news of Harry?|No.
{103102}{103166}Somebody always gets it|on the night patrol.
{103167}{103215}What do you think, Marryat?|You saw it happen.
{103217}{103293}{y:i}Is there any chance|he got down alive?
{103295}{103370}No, I don't think so.|The searchlights got him.
{103372}{103456}We were flying low and they heard us.|We started to climb, but it was too late.
{103458}{103562}Shrapnel began bursting all around him.|Two bursts caught him and he started to drop.
{103563}{103700}It was awful to see him down there,|twisting and diving... crippled,|always dropping.
{103702}{103782}Trying every way to get clear of|those lights. Then another burst got him.
{103783}{103855}We could hear him screaming...|Stop! I can't stand it.
{103857}{103937}{y:i}Good thing he took your place, Rutledge.|You might've got it instead of him.
{103939}{104026}Oh, I'll get it sooner or later.|We'll all get it.|Isn't there any end to this?
{104028}{104088}Oh, shut up.|You're always whining.|Shut up yourself.
{104090}{104150}Who'll make me?|I'll make you.
{104255}{104350}Sit down, Jack, and be quiet.|All right. What's the matter|with you fellas?
{104352}{104443}Would anybody like to take|Monte's place on tonight's patrol?
{104444}{104490}Lay off.
{104491}{104524}{y:i}No more soup.|We need some.
{104526}{104596}No more soup.|We need some soup.
{104598}{104690}{y:i}Jymes! Hurry it up.
{104691}{104787}{y:i}Splendid.
{104811}{104891}{y:i}Splendid, Jymes.
{104893}{105013}{y:i}Splendid.|That's what comes from hurrying.
{105015}{105102}What was dinner|before you dropped it, Jymes?
{105104}{105204}A tasty bit of salmon, sir.|Sewer trout again?
{105206}{105254}Hasn't the cook anything else?
{105255}{105339}Well, sir, there's that tin|of pork and beans.|No, we don't want that.
{105341}{105438}Can he do anything with the garbage?|Oh, well, never mind.|We aren't hungry, are we?
{105440}{105509}Coffee, Jymes.
{105511}{105558}{y:i}Yes, sir.|And, Jymes.
{105559}{105605}{y:i}Yes, sir?|Don't let anything hurry you.
{105607}{105661}No, sir.
{105733}{105817}{y:i}Drinking again?
{105893}{105953}You dirty louse!|Hey, Baldy.
{105955}{106043}The sooner you get shot down,|the better.|Baldy, darling.
{106045}{106156}{y:i}Now that didn't hurt, Baldy.
{106266}{106338}Monte!|What's the matter with you?|Attention.
{106398}{106445}As you were.
{106533}{106601}The following officers|will report for night patrol.
{106603}{106659}Drayton.|Yes, sir.
{106660}{106695}{y:i}Fuller.|Here, sir.
{106697}{106854}{y:i}Maloney.|Oh, no. Not an old baldheaded man|like me up there in the cold, cold air.
{106856}{106948}Perhaps Fritz|will warm it up for you.
{106950}{106995}{y:i}Neville.|Here, sir.
{106996}{107055}Monte Rutledge.
{107057}{107117}Monte Rutledge.
{107233}{107341}I don't feel very well tonight, sir.|That's all right, boy.|None of us feel well.
{107343}{107438}But you don't understand.|I think I do, Rutledge.
{107440}{107564}But I say, sir. You don't understand.|Th-There seems to be|something the matter with me.
{107566}{107630}I know what's the matter with him.|He's yellow.|Oh, shut up.
{107631}{107699}Oh, let's say it.|Didn't Harry go west last night|because he took this man's place?
{107701}{107738}Keep quiet, Jack.|I will not keep quiet.
{107740}{107832}{y:i}He's yellow and we all know it.|That's a lie!|I'm not yellow.
{107834}{107930}I can see things as they are, that's all.|I'm sick of this rotten business.
{107931}{107987}You fools. Why do you|let them kill you like this?
{107989}{108105}What are you fighting for?|Patriotism. Duty. Are you mad?
{108107}{108238}Can't you see they're just words?|Words coined by politicians and profiteers|to trick you into fighting for them.
{108240}{108332}What's a word compared with life...|the only life you've got.
{108334}{108446}I'll give 'em a word. Murder!|That's what this dirty rotten|politician's war is.
{108447}{108535}Murder! You know it as well as I do.|Yellow, am I?
{108537}{108605}You're the ones that are yellow.|I've got guts to say what I think.
{108607}{108717}You're afraid to say it.|So afraid to be called yellow,|you'd rather be killed first.
{108719}{108802}You fools! You poor, stupid fools.
{108804}{108891}Oh, Monte.|Now, pull yourself together, will ya?
{108893}{108957}Stand up, Rutledge!
{108959}{109075}I've taken a lot of shirking from you|since we came out here,|but this is a bit too much.
{109076}{109141}Sir, he really is ill.|You're a disgrace to your squadron.|Go to your quarters.
{109143}{109190}Yes, sir.
{109673}{109733}Have a cigarette.
{109735}{109798}You don't think I'm yellow,|do you, Roy?
{109800}{109892}Why, of course not.|You're just more sensitive|than the rest of us.
{109894}{109966}I wonder.|Well, stop thinking about it.
{109967}{110023}I wish I could.
{110025}{110101}Haven't I been up twice|on the night patrol?|I'm trying to do my share.
{110103}{110154}Of course you are now.
{110156}{110232}You... You must be pretty well|fed up with me after all this.
{110234}{110334}Oh, that's rot.|I- I'm not yellow.
{110335}{110407}I'm not!|Oh, now, Monte.|Come on. Pull yourself together.
{110519}{110570}Staff Colonel.|Everybody out.
{110595}{110663}Come on, Monte.
{110664}{110718}Stand easy.
{110821}{110953}Well, men, I don't like|what I have to say, but let's face it,
{110955}{111038}you all know|the central munition dump at Spraug.
{111040}{111109}You've tried three times|to bomb that depot without success.
{111111}{111183}{y:i}No fault of yours, of course,|they've guarded it too closely.
{111219}{111315}That munition depot at Spraug|must be destroyed tomorrow morning.
{111339}{111446}Now, then, today a German bombing plane|was forced down within our lines.
{111448}{111533}{y:i}We were lucky enough to capture it|before they had a chance to destroy it.
{111535}{111598}We've fixed it up so it'll fly.
{111600}{111696}We want to use this plane|to bomb the Spraug depot.
{111698}{111770}There's no question that|the venture will succeed this time.
{111771}{111867}The enemy won't suspect|one of their own planes|until after the depot is bombed.
{111869}{111912}Then when they discover the trick,
{111914}{112006}{y:i}well, you... you may have|a little difficulty in getting back.
{112074}{112150}{y:i}I need two men to fly this plane.
{112198}{112254}I'll go, sir.|Are you sure you wanna go?
{112255}{112294}Quite sure, sir.|Very well.
{112295}{112346}I'll go with him, sir.
{112348}{112434}Who are these men?|Lieutenants Monte|and Roy Rutledge, sir.
{112436}{112528}Brothers, eh?|Dismissed.
{112576}{112627}Now, young men,
{112683}{112759}I want you to realize|how important this is.
{112761}{112881}The Seventh Brigade has been ordered|to go over the top in a surprise attack|tomorrow evening at dusk.
{112905}{112997}The brigade doesn't know it,|but I- I'm afraid they're|going to be slaughtered.
{112999}{113055}There's too much artillery|in front of us.
{113056}{113115}If you destroy that munition depot|early tomorrow morning,
{113117}{113197}it will weaken the enemy artillery,|and we may be able to get through.
{113199}{113286}Hundreds of lives|depend on you.
{113288}{113336}Do you understand?|Yes, sir.|Yes, sir.
{113338}{113410}Now, another thing.|The plane you are to fly...
{113411}{113499}is far too dangerous|a piece of armament|to let the enemy recapture it.
{113501}{113573}It must return|or be destroyed.
{113575}{113650}If you were captured,|you'd be shot as spies anyway.
{113652}{113699}Baldy. Oh, Baldy?
{113700}{113800}{y:i}You'll take the morning patrol|in towards Spraug as far as you can.
{113802}{113854}{y:i}You might possibly help them|get back.|By all means.
{113855}{113906}Yes, sir.
{113908}{113984}You'll get your maps|and final instructions|just before taking off.
{113986}{114075}Report to the field at 3:00 a. m.|Until then, let them do as they please.
{114077}{114129}- Yes, sir. 3:00, you two.|- Yes, sir.
{114131}{114182}Good luck.|Thank you, sir.
{114183}{114231}Thank you, sir.
{114391}{114467}- What time is it, Monte?|- Ten past 9:00.
{114469}{114549}{y:i}Helen's canteen closes at 10:00.|We’ve just enough time to get there.
{114551}{114640}- Do you think they'll|let us have the motorcycle?|- Why, of course. We're "it" tonight.
{114642}{114704}Yeah. We're "it" all right.
{114763}{114826}Not sorry, are you?|Oh, let's not talk about it.
{114828}{114908}I'm not even gonna|think about it until 3:00.
{114910}{114970}What's your program?|Wine, women and song?
{114971}{115043}{y:i}Oh, perhaps I'll do without|the song tonight.
{115459}{115539}- See you at Grosson's?|- Either there or at Jacques|across the street.
{115540}{115614}- Wherever you hear the most noise.|- Don't you wanna come in with me|to see Helen?
{115616}{115715}Oh, I better not.|Righto.
{115780}{115856}Where's Helen?
{115858}{115942}She's gone out.|Oh.
{115943}{116027}Was she expecting you?|No.
{116029}{116097}Would you care|to leave a note?
{116099}{116146}Yes, I think I will.
{116148}{116236}Pen and ink on the table.
{117896}{117980}You'll see that she gets this?|Oh, yes.
{117982}{118096}Thank you. Good night.|Good night.
{118546}{118638}Hello. What's up?|She isn't in.
{118662}{118750}That's tough.|Wanna come along with me?
{118751}{118807}Where to?|Grosson's.
{118809}{118843}Righto.
{118898}{118982}Your switch on?
There's the 23rd marker, sir.
Twenty-three miles in one hour and 14 minutes.
Gentlemen, that is moving.
Our engineer is trying to set a record on the first run.
But I doubt if we can maintain this speed on our regular schedule.
Why not? If this train can do it, the rest of them can.
Providing Col. Dodge's new town is worth speeding to reach.
Worth it? You wait and see.
Now it's just the end of the line, but in a few years... it'll give your railroad more business than any town west of Chicago.
I hope you're right, Colonel. You've stuck to that argument for five years.
Why shouldn't I?
I've raised that town from two hog pens and a buffalo waller.
How big is it now, Colonel?
Well, at the last census, gentlemen, they had three buffalo wallers.
Look, there goes the stagecoach from Wichita.
We'll be carrying the mail from now on.
Listen to that snorting teapot.
She's already winded.
By Jove, we'll run her into the ground.
Better put your whip to them.
- Willie?
- Yes, sir, boss?
You go up and tell our engineer... if that stagecoach beats us to the end of the line, he's fired.
Yes, sir. And if this train go any faster...
I'm gonna get off and walk...
'cause I don't like this zest of the Lord.
By George, he's making a good showing, you know it.
- We'll get him.
- We'd better get up some speed here.
- There he goes.
- We've got him.
Gentlemen, that's a symbol of America's future: progress.
Iron men and iron horses.
You can't beat them.
Lucky devils.
Nothing to do, but eat and sleep.
That's right, hardhead.
The only difference between you and them is a pair of horns.
Hush.
Say, Wade, let's cut out a couple of them.
No. We've killed our last buffalo, boys.
The railroad's finished and so is our contract.
Besides, we've a little appointment to keep, you know.
Come on.
Here comes our meal ticket for the last six months.
So that's what a steam engine looks like: a coffeepot on wheels.
Come on, let's pay our respects to the Colonel.
- Hello, Colonel. How are you?
- Fine, son. See you soon.
We'll be there.
By golly, Dodge, you know everybody in Kansas.
Not quite.
Those boys have been working for us... hunting buffalo to feed our construction gang.
The young Irishman is Wade Hatton.
I met him during the war.
He fought for the rebels in Jeb Stuart's cavalry.
Been everywhere, done everything.
Sort of a rover.
Well, it takes all sorts of men to build a railroad.
No, sir. Just a couple of us Irishmen.
On your toes, men!
We're gonna start moving.
Watch those hides they don't slip.
Keep on your toes.
We're gonna start moving.
You drivers keep close together.
Ready to start whenever you say, Jeff.
All right, let's move fast!
- Which one of you men is Jeff Surrett?
- I am. Why?
I'm John Barlow, Commissioner of Indian Affairs, from Kansas.
- You're under arrest. All three of you.
- For what?
For the illegal killing of buffalo and selling their hides.
We got those buffalo on free land, just the same as he did.
He has a government permit to kill buffalo for the railroad workers.
- You got any such permit?
- No.
- Is this some of your business, Hatton?
- I made it my business.
As soon as I found out you were shooting buffalo on Indian territory... stealing the hides, and letting the meat rot in the sun.
When any Indians protested, you shot them down in cold blood.
This has been going on all winter.
It took you till now to catch up with us?
We didn't want to. We just watched you and counted the animals you killed.
You're lying. You'd have made them stop us before, if you'd known.
Why? It seemed a better idea to let you and your pals work your head off... packing and curing those hides until they caught you.
So that's why you waited so long?
The Indians might just as well get the hides in good salable condition.
All right, Hatton.
But I hope you stick around Kansas for a long time... because we're gonna collect for every one of those hides in full.
Right. If you're ever around our way, look us up.
All right, boys.
- Congratulations, Colonel.
- Thanks, Rusty.
Wade, you've been a great help in building this railroad.
Now the real work begins.
We've got to make it pay.
That's up to you.
No, it isn't. I've got other work to do.
We're looking further westward.
I want you to take charge here, help build up this town.
- Organize trade for our road.
- No, thanks, sir.
We're on our way back to Texas.
We'll drive cattle up to meet your railroad.
If we keep hanging around here, these two galoots are gonna get civilized.
We better leave here before old fog head starts eating with a knife and fork.
A knife, anyway.
You couldn't keep Wade here, Colonel.
He's the most moving-on man you ever saw.
First off, he was in the English Army over in India.
Then he got mixed up in some kind of a hooray revolution down in Cuba way.
Then he started punching cattle in Texas.
That was before he enlisted in the war.
So he's either the greatest traveler ever lived... or else he is the biggest liar.
And now, it gives me great pleasure to introduce to you... the man who made this progress possible:
Col. Dodge.
Ladies and gentlemen... today a great chapter of history has been written... and we take justifiable pride... in bringing this railroad to the terminal furthest west in this country.
Someday, and I believe it will be in the near future... a great city will spring from this very spot upon which we now stand.
A city which will represent all that the West stands for: honesty, courage, morality, and culture.
For all the noble virtues of civilization.
I can see a great metropolis of homes, churches, schools.
A fine, decent city, which will become the flower of the prairie.
A city whose name...
Yeah, Colonel. Just what do you aim to call this here perfect metropolis?
What are we going to call it?
Why not call it after the man who made it possible? Dodge City.
That's right. Dodge City it is.
Be sure to give those cattle plenty of salt.
The more water, the more weight.
Cattle is sure some business.
They must come to Dodge City from all over the world, don't they, Pop?
Almost, son. Hold my horse.
Wait, Surrett. You can't ship those cattle.
Where's my money?
You'll get it, Cole.
Why don't you stop worrying?
You've got no right to ship those cattle until I'm paid.
$15,000 dollars, cash in hand.
Those were the terms we agreed on.
Take it easy. I can't be running to the bank every time a train leaves town.
If you don't trust me, other cattle brokers will.
Maybe they used to, Surrett... but not since what happened to Sam Chapin and Kit Sproull.
They trusted you, too, didn't they?
But not me.
I'm coming to your place tonight to collect for these steers.
You have the money waiting for me, or I'm slapping a warrant on you.
You gotta get what's yours when dealing with men like that.
They're no good.
Sure, Pop, but we can handle them.
Hold my horse, son.
I won't be but a minute.
Take your time, Pop, but get all that's coming to us.
- Come along, boys, this is the place.
- Here's the Texan!
You look great tonight, Ruby.
I sure like that new dress.
- Thanks, darling.
- Just for luck.
You don't need any more luck.
That's right, I don't, not as long as I've got you.
That's me.
- Hello, Surrett, I was looking for you.
- Hello, Matt.
You ready to see me?
- I was on my way up to get your money.
- I'll go with you.
Mind waiting a few minutes?
I got some business first.
I don't mind.
But don't try and run out on me.
This is the last chance I'm giving you.
Don't worry. I'm gonna take care of you in a minute.
Come on over and wet your whistle.
- Hey, Jack.
- Yes, sir?
Give Mr. Cole anything he wants, on the house.
Yes, sir. What'll it be, Mr. Cole?
- A glass of beer, please.
- Yes, sir.
Nice-looking bunch of steers we shipped today, Cole.
Yeah. They'd look a lot better if I'd been paid for them.
What do you mean?
Haven't we always paid?
Not from what I've heard.
Maybe you've been listening to too much talk.
Maybe. Maybe not.
Are you calling me a liar?
I'm not calling you anything, Yancey.
In fact, I'd rather not talk to you at all.
- Keep your hand off that gun!
- Why, I...
"... in sure and certain hope of the resurrection of the dead.
"Our Father which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
"Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, as in heaven, so in earth.
"Give us day by day our daily bread, and forgive us our debts...
"as we also forgive everyone that is indebted to us.
"And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen. "
To have him go this way.
It's so cruel, so useless.
You promised you wouldn't cry, Mom.
John, will you look after Mrs. Cole?
You don't have to, Mr. Orth.
I can take care of her.
That's right, Harry.
You're the man of the family now.
Funeral's over.
There's your man, Marshal.
Serve your warrant.
It's about time those guerrillas were taken in hand.
What are you waiting for? Go on.
Don't push me. I know my duties.
Hello, Marshal.
Yancey, I've got a warrant here to arrest you for the murder of...
Matt Cole.
Why don't you go ahead and serve it?
What are you waiting for?
- Mind riding back into town with me?
- Yeah.
That's all right, Yancey.
You go ahead and ride in with the Marshal.
Why, sure, Marshal. Come along.
Come on, boys. Come on, Al.
After all, the law's the law.
Now, just a minute, Marshal.
- This is your...
- Now, hold on there, boys.
- Wait a minute.
- Get him in there, boys. Hurry up.
Come on, boys.
We'll ride him out of town in style.
What's the use of trying to make an honest town of Dodge City?
Surrett's crowd scares off the honest, law-abiding settlers.
They're all going on to Wichita and Kansas City.
I tell you, Ellen, we're the public disgrace of America.
You know what the New York newspapers are saying?
There's no law west of Chicago, and west of Dodge City, no God.
I'm afraid they're not far wrong.
It's becoming unsafe for a woman to walk on the streets in this town.
And as for children...
I almost wish Lee and Abbie weren't coming to live with us.
They'll be all right, unless they're as bullheaded as their father was.
We haven't had a word from them since they reached Texas.
When do you suppose they're gonna get here?
I kept a record somewhere.
- I always used to...
- They're on the table.
Yeah, the dates.
They left Fort Worth three weeks ago with a cattle-drive party.
Now, let's see.
Yeah, they must have crossed the Red River about here... then on up the Chisholm Trail into the Indian territory.
I'd say they'd be about Broad Plain by now.
Tex.
- Have you seen my brother?
- Yes'm.
He's over yonder somewhere hotfooting it around.
He swiped one of the boss's horses and I reckon he sure is drunk again.
I consider that a very impertinent remark.
Yes'm, I guess maybe I shouldn't have said he's drunk... even if he is drunk.
I don't know what I'm going to do about you.
Broad Plain, huh?
This is where the Indians are supposed to be?
Yes. If you keep up the fuss you're making... you'll have them right on our doorstep.
I wish they would attack us.
It's dull plugging along like this day in and day out.
It's dull, but that's no reason for you to act like a lunatic.
Maybe they don't even know we're here.
Let's tell them.
Stop it!
Was that you who fired those shots,
Mr. Irving?
- Sure it was him.
- Sure it was. What about it?
Nothing, except it seems like a silly waste of ammunition.
He won't do it again. He was just bored.
Faith, now, that's a great shame.
- So am I.
- Really? Well, I'm sorry.
Perhaps things will get enlivened for you if that shooting stampedes the cattle.
Since you seem to know what troubles him...
I'd suggest you see he drinks less.
Them two youngsters is more trouble than they're worth.
I'll certainly be glad to hand them over to their uncle in Dodge.
She sure is pretty, though.
Yes. I'd still trade the two of them for one good cigar.
All right, this is it! Tex! Rusty!
Tex, get the steers watered.
Rusty, line up the wagons at the bottom of that slope.
- Get moving, flat neck.
- Hush, I'll get moving.
All right, folks, we're bedding down.
Watch your cook fires, now.
The grass is awful dry.
- Don't you wander off.
- Ma, I'm hungry.
All right, get your teams hooked up.
We're pulling out.
- Move as soon as you're ready.
- Tex, get the herd started.
Wade, you better watch old bullet head here.
I caught him riding in the wagon yesterday.
- Hush. I was...
- Hush up.
Good morning, Mrs. Harper.
Did you rest well?
- Thank you. Fine.
- Good.
Be sure you boil that water before you drink it.
I'll bet two minutes after you were born, you were telling the doctor what to do.
Think so? I'm sorry, Miss Irving.
You know, it's really no fun playing boss... but someone's gotta say what's to be done, haven't they?
You know, out here... a trail boss has sometimes got to take the law into his hands.
Yes. "Pioneering," I believe you call it, don't you?
That's right.
You don't seem to be enjoying it much.
Enjoying it?
Can anyone enjoy being jolted along week in and week out... through a nightmare of heat and dust... with sand in your teeth, eyes, and hair?
Faith, now. If you didn't like sand, maybe you shouldn't have left home.
I wouldn't have.
But we didn't have much choice after Father died.
I see. I'm sorry.
Here, can I take that?
It looks heavy for you.
No, thanks. I can manage it.
I'm sure you can manage a bigger one in each hand, if you wanted to.
But why should you?
- Because I happen to be in a hurry.
- We'll wait for you.
There. See?
If everyone in the camp obeyed orders as willingly and charmingly as that... we wouldn't have any trouble at all.
My brother and I seem to be causing you a great deal of trouble, Mr. Hatton.
No, just your brother.
You know, I think you spoil him by mothering him, don't you?
Maybe I do.
May I make a suggestion?
Why don't you go...
Look here, Mr. Irving!
This ain't no picnic grounds.
Put up that gun before you stampede them cattle.
Get down off your high horse, will you, cowboy?
Watch me shoot the handle right off of this one.
- Are you out of your mind?
- Hiya, Abbie.
You're just in time to witness an exhibition of some real fancy shooting.
Put up that gun before somebody takes it away from you.
Who's gonna take it away from me?
You're drunk, you don't know what you're doing.
Don't start to lecture me.
I've had enough of that for now.
Lee, don't!
It's a run!
Tex, head in those leaders and keep them milling.
See what you've done.
I hope you're satisfied.
I've been waiting to see some action since this trip started.
You crazy galoot!
You saw what nearly happened.
What? Just gave you lazy cowhands a little exercise, that's all.
Irving, you're giving us a great deal of trouble.
- You're gonna force me to be unpleasant.
- Let me alone.
I'm not on your payroll, and I'll do as I please.
No, you'll do as I please.
You people in the wagons came to us for protection.
You paid for it, and you're getting it.
You'll obey orders until we reach Dodge City.
You may not realize it, but the Civil War is over... and you're no longer in the Army, Mr. Hatton.
I'm not gonna argue with you.
Sober up and stay sober, or I'll confiscate your liquor.
If you lay a hand inside our wagon,
I'll blow it off.
Look, Irving... we've got a very special treatment for bad little boys like you.
You behave yourself or you'll ride into Dodge City backwards on a mule.
You'll look very silly.
Now we're moving. You better get started.
- Lee, be sensible.
- Let me alone.
I can hardly wait to see you on that mule.
You sure will look funny.
Take that stupid grin off your face, you big hyena.
Drop that gun, Irving! Drop it, I tell you!
You've killed him.
Here you are, Tex. That's for Dr. Irving.
Take the shortcut into Twin Forks.
Bear left from there.
It's three hours to Dodge. Understand?
Sure I do, Wade.
I tried to explain in it.
Tell him I'll call on him when we get there.
I sure hope that doctor is more understanding than his niece.
- Good luck. Get going, Tex.
- Goodbye.
Miss Irving.
I know how you must feel about all this... and I know how you must feel about my part in it.
My shot was unavoidable.
I'd never have fired it except to defend myself.
I've no words to tell you how badly I feel about it all.
Will you leave me alone, please?
Well, so this is Dodge City, huh?
It sort of smells like Fort Worth, don't it?
That's not the city you smell. That's you.
We'd better get you to a bathtub before somebody shoots you for a buffalo.
Gentlemen, can I hold your horse?
Lady, can I carry your basket?
Gentlemen, can I hold your horse?
Gentlemen, can I hold your horses?
I'll watch them real careful.
- What's the idea, sonny?
- I'm in business.
I'm the man of the family now.
You're certainly making an early start.
What do you charge?
A quarter just for keeping an eye on your horses.
50 cents for watching them extra good.
All right, then.
We'll take $1 worth of the extra good.
Didn't Shakespeare begin by holding horses?
- Who?
- Hey, stranger, where's the money?
So you don't get any credit here, either?
Here you are.
- Thanks, mister. Much obliged.
- You're welcome.
William Shakespeare.
I never heard of him.
What part of Texas is he from?
Stratford-on-Avon.
- Good morning, boys.
- Good morning.
- You fellows look pretty dusty.
- We certainly are.
It's on us about an inch thick for each state in the country.
What's the news in Dodge?
Just about the same as always: gambling, drinking, and killing.
Mostly killing.
Had one here just the other night.
Coldest-blooded thing I ever heard of.
Man named Yancey shot Matt Cole over at the Gay Lady.
Matt Cole? I used to know him in Texas.
What was the trouble?
What was the trouble?
How long since you been in Dodge?
Quite some time.
We always ship up through Wichita.
This town is run by a man named Jeff Surrett.
Cole was trying to collect for some cattle he sold.
$15,000, Surrett owed him.
Good morning, gentlemen.
How long before you'll be through with this fellow?
In about 10 minutes, Mr. Surrett.
All right, hurry it up.
I'm gonna take a bath. Yancey.
I'm sorry, there's somebody in there already.
Hey, shut that door!
There's a draft in here.
What's the idea, Charlie?
You know I always take a bath on Saturday mornings.
Get that fellow out of there.
I'm sorry, I can't do that, Mr. Surrett.
He ain't been in there half an hour.
He's been in there long enough.
You tell him to get his clothes on.
All right.
- Wait a minute.
- What did you say?
My friend in there paid for that tub.
Much as you undoubtedly need a wash, he needs it even more.
If it ain't our old friend Hatton.
Right. Quite a coincidence, isn't it?
You figuring on being around Dodge City long?
No, just as long as it takes me to finish my job.
Maybe longer, if I find it interesting.
Any objections?
No, I think we can make it pretty interesting for you.
Yes, I'm sure you might.
I hear you made it pretty interesting for Matt Cole the other night.
You always did hear a little too much.
It's possible you boys were always a little too noisy.
Come on there, Charlie. Finish me up.
Put some of that green stuff on.
Make me smell like a geranium.
- Say, Wade.
- What?
You know, it just come to me who that fellow was.
It did? Marvelous.
Naturally, our nephew's death was a great blow to us.
But now, since your explanation,
I can understand how it happened.
There's no sense in holding any grudge against you.
Thank you, sir.
We're used to death here in Dodge City,
Mr. Hatton.
Even of the people we love.
That's hard to say, but it's true.
Yes, I suppose so.
Thanks again, Doctor.
I wonder if I might pay my respects to Mrs. and Miss Irving on my way out?
No, my boy. I wouldn't advise that.
Walter, Mr. Evans wants you to come as soon as you can.
- Excuse me.
- Ellen, this is Mr. Hatton.
- How do you do, Mrs. Irving?
- He's come to tell us about Lee.
It's regrettable that we have to meet under these circumstances, Mrs. Irving.
I'm sorry, my boy.
But, you see, we never had any children of our own.
And to my wife, Lee was...
Well, you can understand how she feels about it.
Yes, of course.
Anyhow, it was very gracious of you to receive me, sir.
Don't bother about that thing, sir. I can...
Miss Irving.
I'll not be troubling you with any further apologies.
But I would like you to know that if ever I can be of any service to you...
- I shall be only too happy.
- Thank you.
The only way you can be of service to me is to keep out of my sight.
I wouldn't take that too seriously, my boy.
Women's logic and emotions are often very confusing.
I think I've heard my father say the same thing.
I'm sure that Miss Abbie has a more biting tongue... than my mother ever had.
All right, gentlemen, let's begin the auction.
One thousand six hundred and nineteen head of prime Texas steer.
Grass-fed, fat, frisky, fresh off the Chisholm Trail.
Is that correct, sir?
Go ahead.
But don't make any sale until I tell you.
Right. The agent reserves his right to refuse all bids.
Now then, who'll start us off?
What am I offered?
$25 a head.
$25 from Mr. Surrett. I'm going to $28.
$28 for the finest herd of steers that ever come out of Texas.
- Who'll say $28? Mr. Cagle?
- No, sir.
Mr. Orth?
Here's a cash profit of $50,000 begging to be picked up.
- All right, $28.
- Thank you, sir.
$28 is bid. Who'll say $30?
- Nobody will raise it?
$30 from Mr. Surrett.
Anybody raise that? Anybody say $32?
How about you, Mr. Orth?
Going to Mr. Surrett for $30.
Once. Going twice.
Hold on.
Will Mr. Surrett and Mr. Orth be kind enough to step up here?
Mr. Surrett, Mr. Orth, will you come over here, please?
You offered $30. Was that cash?
What's that to you?
Do you own those cattle?
I'm the agent for them.
I'm protecting the owner's interest.
I see.
I'll give you part of it in cash tonight and the balance in 30 days.
I see. How about you, sir?
I could've paid the full amount in cash today.
- You could have? Right. They're yours.
- Mine?
- But he offered...
- I said, sold.
What are you trying to do?
I made the high bid on those steers.
I heard you. But I prefer to make my deal with cash buyers... who don't pay off in the back rooms of saloons.
I'm at the Drovers Hotel, Mr. Orth.
If you care to meet me at 3:00 in Room 15, we can close this deal.
- I'll be there.
- Right.
Deal is made, Mr. Auctioneer.
Thanks. Good day.
Sold to Mr. Orth.
- Joe, did you hear that?
- I'll put it right on the front page.
- Who's that fellow?
- I don't know.
But you can bet I'm gonna find out.
- How are you, Harry?
- Hello, Mr. Orth.
- I'll hold your horse for you.
- Good.
- For a quarter.
- Well, that's fair enough.
- Here.
- Thanks.
How are you, Frank?
- Fine. How are you, Mr. Orth?
- Just fine.
- Howdy, Mr. Orth.
- Howdy.
Stick 'em up.
Rusty, we're done for.
It's Dangerous Ambrose, the terror of the prairie. He's got us in his power.
Yes, sir. I'm a pretty desperate character.
I can see that.
Would you take ransom if we offered it to you?
Try it and see.
How's that?
Thanks, mister.
I'll watch your horses better than they were ever watched before.
That's fair enough.
I sure hope you stay in town a long time.
I'll bet you do at that.
Mr. Orth come in yet?
He went upstairs a few minutes ago,
Mr. Hatton.
My name is Joe Clemens.
I'm editor of the Star.
I'd like to publish your impressions of Dodge City, if you don't mind.
Jack Orth. Somebody shot him.
He's laying right outside of Room 15.
That's too bad, Hatton.
I don't think your deal with Orth will go through.
But I'm still offering you $30 a head for those cattle.
Listen, Surrett. Those cattle aren't for sale to you at any price.
It's a shame about Jack Orth being killed, isn't it?
Must have been a big surprise to you.
Excuse me.
Another murder. Four or five a day.
Surrett's getting to be the undertaker's best friend.
It's sure getting dangerous to live around here.
Why don't you get out?
Clemens, I see by that bulletin that you're looking for trouble again.
What's the matter?
We're just printing the plain facts.
We've put up with you and your paper long enough. Now we mean business.
Yancey, you're not scared of that fellow from Texas, are you?
We'll take care of him.
But I'm warning you, don't print no story about Surrett. Is that clear?
I'm waiting for an answer.
I reckon you get the general idea now.
Rusty, I don't like the look of those clothes.
They look like you're up to no good.
I ain't had store clothes on for a long time.
I kind of felt like I wanted to clean up.
I got a call to make down here, so you're on your own.
Just try and keep sober and stay out of trouble.
You know I signed the temperance pledge before we left Texas.
Sure, I know that.
You were blind drunk when you signed it.
No, you're confusing the issue.
I'm a reformed man.
Even a reformed man can get into trouble when the boys get paid off.
No, I ain't gonna touch a drop.
I'm just gonna mosey around and take in the sights.
Look out you don't become one of them.
Wade, don't you worry none about it.
You don't think after me getting store clothes... that I'll have anything like that happen to me, do you?
Hey, mister.
Please help me over, will you, young man?
Come closer.
There you are, ma'am. Glad to be of help.
- Hi, Rusty. Come on, have a drink.
- Hi, Rusty.
Come with us and get your feet wet.
- Sorry, Tex. I'm just leaving.
- What do you mean, leaving?
We got a lot of Kansas dust to wash down.
Come on.
Waste my pay on liquor and gambling?
Not me, boys. I'm on the pledge.
You ain't serious, Rusty?
I tell you, boys, I've saw the light.
I'm through with your sinful ways and your riotous living.
He must be crazy with the heat.
Hey, you old walrus, you!
I don't want that. Give me one of those.
That's more like it.
My gracious!
Howdy, young man.
Are you a stranger in town?
Yes, ma'am. But I sure didn't know this was just for women folks.
But it isn't. Not at all.
We're mighty glad to have you.
But first of all, let me introduce our beloved president, Mrs. McCoy.
So delighted to meet you in this charitable institution.
Ma'am, my name is Hart. Algernon Hart.
Mr. Algernon Hart.
Well, Mr. Hart, you're just in time for the meeting.
But first, come and have a cup of tea,
Mr. Harvey.
Hart, ma'am.
I'm so sorry. Mr. Hart.
Come, girls. Help me.
Now, here's your tea. I hope you like it.
- One or two?
- Three, ma'am.
Are you married?
- Hey, Joe!
- Yeah?
How about that Dixie?
That's for the Fifth Kansas Infantry.
He chased those fellows so far from Fredericksburg... they ain't stopped running yet.
Yeah? They must have stopped running long enough to get their picture took.
Nobody ever chased the Fifth Kansas, mister.
- Do you belong to it?
- All of us do.
So is that a fact?
You must have had to run a long way to get back to Kansas.
Well, it's gonna be a longer run back to Texas.
It's that dreadful saloon next door.
Mabel, please close the shutters.
I'm so sorry, Mr. Hart.
And there I was, a poor orphan, no ma, no pa.
Brung up by Comanche Indians.
No matter where you go, fighting ain't good.
It ain't no use to fight.
Fighting is a thing I...
I don't like it myself. And now I want...
That's a present from U. S. Grant.
That's for Robert E. Lee.
Yes, sir. And I want to say to you, sisters... that when righteousness flows from the...
It was smooth.
Who's next?
Come get these fleas out of my hair.
Stop it, you fools! Stop it, I say! Stop it!
Thanks, Rusty. Just in time.
Stop it, you fools!
All right, boys. Looks like we dusted this place out pretty good.
That's one fight you Yanks didn't win.
But take it easy.
We'll send a veterinary right over.
Come on!
Somebody's gonna pay for this and it ain't gonna be with money.
When I seen the light, it come to me sort of vision-like.
And I was saved.
Hey, Jeff, there's one of them
Texas heroes left behind.
- Let me take a sock at him.
- No, I'll handle this.
You boys had a lot of fun, didn't you?
- We sure did.
- That's fine.
I've been waiting a long time for you and your pal to make a move...
- and this looks like it.
- What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna have some fun now paying back an old debt with interest.
Come on, boys.
Let's take him out to the plaza.
Bring him along.
- Hey, Doc! Mr. Hatton!
- What's wrong, Joe?
Your men just wrecked the Gay Lady saloon.
- Anybody hurt?
- I don't know.
They're gonna hang one of your boys.
- Where are the rest?
- They've ridden back to camp.
- Where's the hanging party?
- Right in the middle of the plaza.
You're plum loco.
- I ain't done nothing to be strung up for.
- Shut up.
Hold on, boys.
Be careful, Mr. Hatton. Take it easy.
That rope is strong enough for both of them.
What do you think of that?
I've no wish to spoil your fun, Surrett.
But would you be kind enough to tell those men to let him go?
Sure. We'll let him go just as quick as he gets through dancing around up there.
You heard what I said, I think.
Tell them to let him go.
All right. String him up, boys.
Put 'em up! Stick 'em up!
Keep reaching high, boys, or you know what happens to Surrett.
Get over here, Rusty. Get his gun.
We may never be this close again, Surrett.
I'm anxious to hear what the sheriff has to say about this hanging.
Start walking.
- What are you gonna do with him?
- No warrant for his arrest.
Did he have a warrant to hang this man?
You can't jail him without a sheriff's order.
That's where we're going.
To get a sheriff's order.
Wait a bit. What's this?
Where's the sheriff?
Somebody ran him out of town.
Mr. Surrett's the law in Dodge now.
I see.
Why don't you make him sheriff then?
Yeah. That's not a bad idea.
Why not?
And if I can be of any service to you gents, just let me know.
That's the first jail I've ever seen you couldn't get in.
Come on. Good day, gentlemen.
- It was all a mistake.
- A mistake?
I thought you promised me you weren't going to get into trouble.
Shucks, Wade, I really wasn't in trouble.
I see. You're the sort who doesn't really get into trouble... until they start nailing the lid down on your coffin.
What's that?
"Pure Prairie League of Dodge City. "
Wait till I tell Tex about this.
Don't tell Tex.
Well, gentlemen, what's this all about?
You all look as though you lost a dollar and found a dime.
All right. Go ahead and tell him, Doctor.
Thank you.
Mr. Hatton, we've invited you here this afternoon with a special purpose.
We want you to help us clean up our city.
Up to date, our police officers have not been equal to the job.
They've either got killed or run out of town.
Won't you take the job?
Gentlemen, I certainly appreciate your confidence in me.
But I'm afraid a position like that isn't quite in my line.
You're asking me to turn policeman.
I have about as much qualifications for that as I have teaching the ballet.
You seemed to be well-qualified the other day in the plaza.
I had to get that big hardhead out of that somehow.
Any one of you would have done the same. No.
We know what we're asking of you and the chances you'd be taking.
But it's finally come to a showdown.
Who's gonna run Dodge: we or Surrett?
We're inviting peaceful emigration here, family men with women and children.
And we meet them with what's come to be called Hell Street.
I can certainly appreciate everything you say.
But as far as I'm concerned, it can't be done.
I'm in the cattle business.
That demands all my time and attention.
I'm sorry.
I wish you'd think it over, my boy.
We need you.
You're asking the wrong man,
Uncle Walter.
He isn't interested in the lives of innocent people.
Why should he care what happens to you and your families?
Your struggle to make a living in a decent city?
What Dodge City needs is a man with a sense of public pride... and the courage to back it up by shooting it out with men of equal skill.
But Mr. Hatton's bravery consists of gunfights with impulsive boys.
Abbie, stop it.
Well, gentlemen,
I don't think much remains to be said.
Mrs. Irving, thank you.
Goodbye, gentlemen.
Quickly as you can. Come along.
Harry, keep out of that lunch basket.
I can't seem to get my mind off those pies, Miss Abbie.
- How long before we eat?
- Not till we get to Sycamore Springs.
- Come along.
- I'll do my best to wait.
Everybody in?
Here we go. Come along.
Cross the river here, Russ, and bear due west on Wichita.
When are you fixing to get started?
First thing in the morning.
I'm sick of this town.
Good morning.
I know that man.
Hello, stranger.
Hello there, Shakespeare.
- Here.
- Thanks.
You'd better watch that riverbed, too.
It's probably gonna be dry.
Steady!
I'll help you! Give me those reins.
Let me drive.
Let me through. Darling!
He was trying to help me.
Get a doctor, quick.
I'm afraid a doctor won't be any use.
Even children.
This has got to stop.
Oh, my darling. My little baby.
Go on.
You're all under arrest.
Take them out, boys.
Get in there.
I wanted to be sure you'd seen this, Surrett.
So I paid you a special visit.
I've already seen it.
It looks like you're trying to run everybody out of Dodge City.
No, not everybody.
Just the undesirable element.
There's no law in Kansas that prevents a man from carrying a gun...
- or coming or going where he pleases.
- There's going to be one.
Sit down, Hatton.
The merchants are not gonna stand for this.
Yes, I think they will. The merchants helped me draw this law up.
They're willing to take their chances.
I just wanted to be certain about you, though.
- Let's get down to cases, Hatton.
- Right.
What cases?
You and I have had a couple of run-ins.
But I'll forget them if you do, and see if we can't work together.
If you really mean that, that'll make my job easier.
- Your job is just what you make it.
- So I hear.
The last few sheriffs here didn't do so well, did they?
They weren't your type. Just a bunch of dumb sheep wearing badges.
I never even bothered to talk to them.
I'll bet if you had, you'd have told them a thing or two.
Not what I'm gonna tell you anyway.
Now listen, Hatton.
There's no reason that Dodge City can't be run properly.
Just so long as you don't try to change things too much.
Because this is a cattle town, the biggest one on earth.
And that's what it's always gonna be.
There's more than $20 million worth of beef and hides... comes through here every year.
You know that because you bring them up.
You've been holding the wrong end of the sack... because the real money ain't working for those Texas breeders.
No, sir. It's right here in Dodge City because this is where they pay off.
You mean, on your roulette tables.
Sure, coming and going.
If not for the Gay Lady, that money would go out of Dodge City... and the trade would move right on to Wichita.
You know that cattle crowd.
After months of backbreaking work getting the cattle here... they want a little fun and freedom.
If it's not here, they'll go where they can get it.
- And you'd go broke.
- Sure. But I ain't aiming to.
You see, I make $100,000 a year one way or another.
Frankly, I don't need that much money.
Naturally, I'd be willing to make a deal with anybody... that would sort of see things my way.
Make a mighty good deal for both of us.
You mean, a little friendly bribery?
You can catch more flies with molasses than you can with vinegar.
True enough.
I hope you'll not be offended... but I don't like the smell of your molasses.
You'd better get rid of that gun by Monday. You're north of Front Street... and that jail's apt to be a little crowded.
What's the matter? Didn't it work?
He wouldn't listen to reason?
No, he wouldn't.
All right, Russ, let's go. We've a lot to do.
Don't ever do nothing like that unless I tell you to.
This ain't the time. We gotta wait a while.
They sure make a fella feel at home around here.
Yes. They'll even dig you a home, if you're nice to them.
One at a time here, fellas. Line up.
There you are.
- Will I get this stuff back again?
- You sure will.
- Disarm me? Not for no man.
- Nobody gets my gun.
- What a leery idea.
- Who does he think he is?
- Bet two.
- I'll call it.
- Raise it five.
- Call five.
- I'm dead.
- Kings up.
- I guess we better quit, boys.
- Quitting because you're winning?
- You read that sign, didn't you?
- We don't believe in signs.
That sheriff's a big four-flusher and that sign's been bad luck to me all night.
Guess that'll show you
Hatton ain't bluffing.
That's right, gentlemen.
Hatton's not bluffing.
- You're all under arrest.
- For what?
For not believing in signs.
All right, deputies, take them.
- Come on.
- Let go, now.
I tried to warn them, but I guess they gotta learn through experience.
I don't know what you're warning people about.
- What do you mean?
- You're north of Front Street, aren't you?
- And you're carrying a gun, aren't you?
- Yeah.
- Right. You're under arrest.
- What?
Come on.
But I'd feel undressed without my gun.
Where you're going, you won't need any clothes for a few days.
If I was you,
I'd rather arrest my brother than me.
Hey, Rusty, you are a traitor...
I'm sorry, boys,
I can't do anything about it.
Wade, you ain't gonna keep me in here, are you?
Sorry, Tex. You read that notice the same as anyone else.
Three days in there won't do you a bit of harm.
You can't do this to me after all we've been through together.
We fought the war together, built the railroad... we ate, drank, slept, lived, and died together.
Now we're gonna be in jail together: you in there and me out here.
Isn't that wonderful? That makes seven families that have moved in this week.
That does my heart good.
There's the Turner family, moving back from Wichita.
And after she said she'd never set foot in Dodge again.
Welcome home, Mr. Turner!
- How do you do, Mr. Clemens?
- Hello, Joe.
Isn't that the sweetest bonnet she's got on? It's brown moiré.
Moiré. How do you spell "moiré"?
M- O-I-R-E?
Who in tarnation gives a hoot what Mrs. Turner's wearing?
Just about every blessed woman in town, that's all.
What happened in this fight between the Indian and Jim Kendall?
I went into that pretty thorough.
There wasn't no fight.
They called each other names, the Indian throwed a knife at Kendall.
Kendall sort of fired a couple of shots.
Nobody got hurt.
Nobody got... I see. It wasn't a real fight, it was just a sort of friendly argument.
- Hello, Tex.
- Hi, fellas.
Come on in and sit down.
What are you doing with that secondhand store around your neck?
Where've you been?
We ain't saw you for days.
Around. Been doing a lot of thinking lately.
Thinking?
I hope you're gonna take that job
I offered you.
We need another good deputy around here.
That's what I've been thinking about.
I've decided to go back to Texas.
- What for?
- I don't know.
This place is getting too big, and calm, and peaceful-like.
You mean,
Rusty and I have stopped all the fun?
It's all right for women and children, but I've decided to go back to Texas.
If you've made up your mind, that's that.
There's nothing we can do to keep you here?
- No.
- So long, Tex.
- So long, Wade.
- Give him back his gun. Number 27.
If you're ever around here, that job will still be waiting for you.
No, sir. I just don't fit in a sissy town like this.
I certainly hate to see you go.
I'll miss you fellas, too, a lot.
We had a lot of fun together.
So long, knot head.
If I hung around here much longer,
I'd be riding a side saddle.
Yes, I suppose so.
All right, Rusty. Arrest that man.
- Who? Me?
- What for?
He's carrying a gun, isn't he?
Give him back his old room.
- Morning, Joe.
- Hello, Wade. What's the news?
You ought to know.
Haven't you read your paper?
Got those tax notices ready?
- Hack's just running them off.
- Fine.
- Come on in.
- All right.
Have a chair.
You look as though you're pretty busy...
- Fred?
- Yes, ma'am.
- Would you set this in my copy, please?
- I will, ma'am.
- Joe...
- Good morning.
Did you want something?
I'd like to have my curiosity satisfied.
What are you doing here?
Obviously, I'm working.
Obviously. But at what and why?
The town is growing by leaps and bounds, and the paper needed somebody... who would write things that would interest its women readers.
I see. Tell me, what are the vital interests of your women readers?
What other women are wearing... how to make Lady Baltimore cake with two eggs... who invited the minister to tea... and whose baby is going to be born and when.
- Fascinating.
- Is there anything else you'd like to know?
What do the doctor and Mrs. Irving think about it?
They made the same stupid objections that you're making mentally now.
But when I decide on a thing,
I usually manage to carry it through.
Yes, I've noticed that.
You realize that people are inclined to think that a newspaper office... is an odd place for a charming lady like you to be working, don't you?
Are you the delegation sent to tell me that?
No.
I stop trouble around here. I don't start it.
- What's wrong with my working here?
- It's undignified. It's unladylike.
You ought to be home doing needlework.
Things like that.
Sewing buttons on for some man,
I suppose.
Buttons come off.
Someone's gotta sew them on.
That's a fine career for an intelligent woman.
- Here are your tax notices, Wade.
- Thanks.
There will be wailing and gnashing of teeth when these go out.
Abbie, I know this isn't in your line... but as long as you insisted on the job... will you stop calling them
"cows in the stockyard"?
They're steers. Steers.
I don't see any difference.
"A rise is expected this season in the price of longhorn cows. "
Never mind. I'll correct this copy myself.
"Longhorn cows. " I must be running along.
By the way, may I let you into a little secret?
What?
You've got a smudge of ink on your nose.
Goodbye. Goodbye, Joe.
Goodbye, Wade...
I'm sorry. Abbie.
Is this showing proper respect for the law?
I never saw the law fall on its face before.
I didn't fall on my face.
There's an old saying in the British Army:
"The law must always save its face in front of the natives. "
And what if the natives object to its face?
We just put them across our knee... and spank them soundly.
You're not suggesting that I'm a native?
No. The only real native of Kansas is the buffalo.
He's got a very hard head, a very uncertain temper... and a very lonely future.
Apart from that, there's hardly any comparison between you.
- Goodbye, Joe.
- Goodbye, Wade.
Goodbye.
I like that fella.
"Cows in the stockyard. "
Of course, I ain't a man who believes in taxes.
But I can see they're a necessary evil.
Somebody's gotta pay for schools and churches and such things.
Especially now that the town's getting so darn big.
Yes, sir.
They do say there's nothing certain except taxes and death.
Get up, Hatton.
What for?
A couple of the boys are waiting outside to have a little talk with you.
I see.
You know, I'm really surprised at Surrett.
I thought he had more intelligence than to send you here on a silly deal like this.
- You haven't got a chance...
- Shut up and get out of that chair quick.
About 10 days for this customer.
Five to cool off and five to think it over.
You bet. I'll take care of it personally.
Come on, sonny boy.
I'll buy you some candy.
- What were you saying about taxes?
- What taxes?
I don't remember.
Shall I trim your mustache?
No, thanks. I think I can manage.
See that big herd of buffalo grazing away so peacefully down there?
The trouble with the buffalo is they had things too easy at the start.
It works the other way around, too.
Take us, for example.
We had such a bad beginning.
We'll have a wonderful future.
That's typical Irish logic: totally unconnected.
You think so?
It may be Irish, but it's not unconnected, and I can prove it.
Thirty years ago, my father met my mother at the Londonderry fair.
He'd come down to sell some prize pigs.
Big, fat, lovely pigs they were.
Mother was down there after winning the grand prize for her roses.
Roses of Sharon, enormous, big things, as big as your face and nearly as beautiful.
I don't suppose there were ever roses like that in the whole of Ireland.
What must happen?
The very last day of the fair...
Father's pigs get out and eat up every single one of Mother's prize roses.
Root, stem, flower and all.
Did any two people ever get off to a worse start than that?
Look at them now: six big lusty sons, a score or so of prize pigs... and the most beautiful rose garden in the whole of Antrim.
I envy you people who have kissed the Blarney Stone.
You do?
It's cold on the lips.
I think we'd better be getting back.
I'm afraid it'll be dark before we get there.
- Are you sure it's the dark you're afraid of?
- What do you mean?
- Maybe you're afraid I might kiss you.
- You wouldn't dare.
I wish I were as sure of that as you are.
May I?
Thank you.
You know, I was just thinking... the buffalo wouldn't be so badly off if the buffalo didn't have a one-track mind.
But then the buffalo wouldn't be a buffalo, would it?
I suppose not.
You wouldn't be you unless you thought you might like that kiss.
- You seem very sure of my reactions.
- Oh, no.
That's something you can never be sure about until you've tried it.
Can you?
Good morning, Abbie.
Good morning, Mrs. Cole. How are you?
So-so.
Won't you come in and sit down?
There. Is there anything I can do for you?
Yes, I'd like to run this advertisement in your paper.
That is, if it doesn't cost too much money.
Our advertising rates are very low.
I'm sure we'll be able to.
You want to sell your house?
No, I don't want to. I have to, Abbie.
Let's get a new lead line on this church bazaar story.
How do, Mrs. Cole? How are you today?
- Good morning, Joe.
- How much will you charge on this?
One, two, three, four...
You're selling your house?
You're not leaving town, are you?
No, I just...
Joe, I can't afford to keep it up.
I can't even begin to meet the taxes on it these days.
I can't understand that.
Matt always made good money.
Just the day he died... he collected $15,000 from Surrett.
Didn't he?
That's what I thought, too, but I've never seen a penny of it.
Well, what have you done about it?
I've spoken to Jeff Surrett about it several times... but he'll never give me a straight answer.
It looks to me like Mrs. Cole needs help, and we might be able to help her.
Yeah, it does look that way.
Mrs. Cole, would you mind if we kind of looked into this?
Mind? I'd consider it a very great favor.
There are a lot of accounts in this town to be settled. Now, let's see.
How's the best way to tackle this?
There you are. The entry, the date, and the figures. $15,000.
What Matt Cole did with his money after that is his business, not mine.
He had $10 on his body when he was found. He never left the saloon.
I make it a point not to discuss the affairs of my customers.
But as long as you force my hand,
I'll give you the facts.
Matt Cole lost that $15,000 playing roulette.
Playing roulette?
I'd like you to remember that, Abbie.
Don't worry, I'll remember.
As a matter of fact, we'll all remember it.
He never went near those roulette tables.
He went straight to the bar and Yancey killed him there.
- According to who?
- You'll find that out in court.
If you've got such a clear case, why don't you arrest me now?
I think we'll wait a few days.
I want to talk to a few more people... before we start giving you board and room at the state's expense.
You're bluffing, Hatton.
You're holding a pair of deuces.
You're bluffing.
Am I?
Munger killed Orth because he spoiled a cattle deal for you.
Yancey killed Cole because he tried to collect $15,000 you owed him.
And more citizens in this town have been killed trying to do business with you.
That's what the three of us are going to prove in court.
We'll see if the jury thinks we're bluffing.
Take that book, Joe.
I want to look at it again.
I can hardly wait to start writing this story.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is going to be the most important article...
that's ever appeared in the Dodge City Star.
There it is. We'll have it out by noon tomorrow.
How did you find out all these other things about Surrett?
Abbie, a good newspaperman has two jobs.
One is to write the news as it happens, day by day.
The other is to be ready for it, and write it first... all but the end.
This is Jeff Surrett's morgue.
I must be an optimist at heart.
I've been getting it ready for a long time.
You two, haven't you got any homes to go to? It's past midnight.
You'd better be running along, Abbie.
The Doc will skin me alive.
We've got Surrett by the scruff of the neck.
You have? Why not let it go tonight and resume your grip in the morning?
You two realize what kind of a target you'd make from out there?
I'm gonna take you home before your uncle gets after Joe with a shotgun.
Here's your cloak.
I'll come back and stay till you finish, Joe.
The story's all written.
You don't have to worry about me.
I'm just gonna mark it for the printer, then call it a day. Italics.
Don't hang around, or Surrett might come in and mark it for you.
They wouldn't try anything at this stage of the game.
You think not? I hope you're right.
Good night, Abbie.
See you in the morning.
- Good night, Joe.
- Good night, Wade.
Lock this door after us when we go out.
Mr. Hatton, I am accustomed to being up after dark.
- Lock it.
- All right.
- Good night.
- Good night.
"The laws of Dodge City must be respected...
"not only by one group of citizens...
"but by all groups. " Paragraph. I like that.
What was that?
Whoever killed Joe Clemens ought to be strung up.
And, by golly, I'll furnish the rope.
If he's got enough neck left to put a rope on.
They sneaked up on him.
Never even gave him a chance.
The bullet went through his heart.
I can only blame myself for this.
But it's one thing they won't get away with.
Little fella sure was aces. It's too bad.
I can't understand it.
Everybody knows that Joe didn't have any enemies except Surrett and his gang.
Who else could have done it?
Isn't it sufficient proof that Joe's story is gone and the whole file on Surrett?
This door was locked.
I know that because I tried it myself.
It's an old lock. Any key will fit it.
- There's nothing here. You're sure?
- He always left his copy here on top... so we could set it up first thing in the morning.
I'm sorry, Sheriff, that's printer's ink.
You can't wash it. It has to wear off.
Did you ever read the contents of Joe's files on Surrett?
I certainly did, and there was enough in it to hang him.
Keep that to yourself.
I think you ought to go now.
You're looking tired. Good night.
See the doctor and Miss Irving home, will you?
Right.
- What's the next move, Wade?
- I suppose we're going to...
Are you sure he isn't in his office upstairs?
I tell you, Surrett left town on the 4:30 train this afternoon.
If you don't believe us, go ask the station agent.
Jeff was halfway to Wichita when the shooting occurred.
You're barking up the wrong tree, mister.
Thanks.
Your bet.
- Your bet.
I call.
Who's winning all the money?
Been playing long?
Ask the bartender. He's got a watch.
What do you know about Joe Clemens, Yancey?
No more than you, except that he's dead.
How did you know he was dead?
I heard some of the boys talking.
People keep dropping in and out of here all the time.
Bet you $5.
I call.
Three fives.
- You're under arrest, Yancey.
- For what?
For the murder of Joe Clemens.
Keep my stack, Bud.
I'll be back in half an hour.
I wouldn't count on that if I were you.
Take him along, Rusty.
What's the matter, Taylor?
Are you nervous?
Go ahead. Deal them.
Yancey seemed a little vague about this game.
Suppose you tell me what happened.
How should I know?
- Why don't you ask one of them?
- I'm asking you.
Did Yancey ever leave this table after the game started?
No. He never left the room.
I told you a hundred times, he never went out of the place.
Come on, you're wasting valuable time.
- Answer my question.
- No, he never left the table.
Stop lying. You're bad at it.
Yancey left that room between midnight and 1:00, didn't he?
- No.
- What time was it, then?
He didn't leave.
Let me work on him, Wade.
I can make him talk.
If you can't, I can.
Let him alone.
Listen, if you're too stupid to realize... you're facing a charge of murder, you deserve what's coming to you.
What do you mean?
I'm gonna have you indicted for murder as an accessory after the fact.
I had nothing to do with it.
You're gonna be dancing in thin air the same as Yancey.
Do you wanna swing, or you wanna tell me and save your neck?
All right. I'll tell you.
Come on.
He went out about 12:30.
Came back in about half an hour.
That's better.
I'll do you a favor, Taylor.
Lock him up.
- Good morning, Mrs. Irving.
- Good morning.
Morning. Did you get anything out of Taylor?
I did. Where's the doctor?
- In there. What's wrong?
- What'd he say?
Morning, Mr. Hatton. Won't you join us?
No, thanks. I came to tell you... it's imperative you get Miss Abbie out of town as soon as possible.
Why, for heaven's sake?
Because only two people beside myself heard Surrett tell that lie... that he saw Matt Cole lose his money playing roulette.
One of those people was Joe Clemens.
That's why Surrett killed him.
You're the only other person who can bear me out in court.
Without you, he can deny it and the jury might believe him.
That's all the more reason why I should stay.
I started this, and I'm going to see it through.
Will you not be a little idiot?
You're life isn't worth a nickel as long as Surrett stays out of jail.
You're the key to our case and he knows it.
We can't go to trial for two weeks.
Your life's gonna be in danger till then.
Even in this house, on the street, everywhere.
I know Surrett and I know what he'd do.
You know I'm right, Doctor.
I want you to get her out of town.
And stay out till I send for you.
- You're right.
- I see what you mean.
Abbie must take the next train for Wichita.
She can stay with the Merrills.
I'll pack a valise at once.
Come and help me get it down off the shelf.
I'd never forgive myself if anything happened to her.
- I won't go. You can't boss me around.
- Can I not, now?
I'm the law in this town and you'll do as I say.
I don't care what you are, I'm staying here.
Aunt Ellen, don't pack...
You are the most stubborn female
I ever met in my life.
Can't you understand I'm doing this because I love you?
All right, you two. Stop arguing.
Don't worry, Mrs. Irving. We've stopped.
What he needs is a rope.
He don't deserve a trial.
Hand him over to us. We'll give him a trial.
This is more like it.
The last time I saw a mob like that was in Texas... when they gave Curley Hawks a necktie party.
Mr. Grant, I want to talk to you.
There's your man. You got 10 minutes.
- Hello, Yancey.
- Hello.
What's going on here?
What's the mob doing...
Now, take it easy, Yancey.
You might as well know this now as later.
They wormed it out of Taylor that you left for a half hour.
They can't hang me on that.
I might have gone anywhere.
Maybe a jury wouldn't hang you... if you ever get to a jury.
What do you mean by that?
What're you trying to say?
Joe Clemens was a mighty well-liked man, Yancey.
He had a lot of friends.
Half the city is planning to break in here tonight... and take things in their own hands.
Where's Jeff?
He's gotta get me out of here.
I telegraphed him an hour ago.
He got off the train at Spearville.
He got off? For what?
Jeff's smart enough to know this town's gonna be warm for a few days.
So he's just laying low until the excitement blows over.
Too warm for him?
So I stay here and get hung for doing his job.
- If you think that I...
- Shut up, you fool!
- You want to tell the whole town?
- You bet I'll tell them.
I'll tell them who paid me to shoot Joe Clemens and Matt Cole.
Let them hang me, sure.
But if I go, Jeff's going with me.
You rustle him up and telegraph him that.
He has to get me out by tonight or I'm giving the whole story to Hatton.
But how can Jeff get you out of here?
I don't know. That's his problem.
Keep your shirt on, Yancey.
I got an idea how Jeff and I can handle this.
First I'll see Hatton.
You got the right man, Hatton.
What are you waiting for?
Yeah, what are we waiting for?
If you don't know what to do with Yancey, we do.
- You bet we do.
- Will you give us some action?
If he won't, we will give him some action.
What are you stalling for?
You know he killed him.
If you don't turn him over to us, we'll come get him tonight.
Listen, men, you fellas put me in this office to enforce the law.
And I'm going to enforce it.
That means a fair trial for any and all prisoners.
Including Yancey.
And understand this:
There is going to be no mob rule around this town as long as I am sheriff.
They're bringing up a pole for a battering ram.
You see? They're right at the door.
Listen to them.
You're in charge, Sheriff.
What are you gonna do?
Wade, what are we gonna do?
The whole town's set on getting him out.
You can't stop them, the five of you against the town.
They'd burn down the building to get in here.
We'd save a lot of trouble if we'd feed him to the mob.
You want to throw my client to that pack of hungry wolves?
Listen, no one's gonna get your client but a jury.
- I promise you that.
- There's only one way to protect him.
Yancey's gotta be taken out of Dodge City before night.
Fat chance we'd have of getting him to the station.
You can hire a closed carriage, drive him to Spearville... and catch the train for Wichita.
Keep him in jail there till he can be tried legally.
- Yes, that might work.
- It will work.
My client's entitled to a fair trial... and it's both our jobs to see that he gets it.
You want me to rustle a carriage, Wade?
Wait a minute. I got a better idea.
But you agree we got to get him out in a hurry?
Yes, but we'll do it my way.
- This is a sample of your future.
- Get in, Russ. Get in.
Hold them off as long as you can.
I'll send word from Wichita.
- Say, what the...
- Keep calm, it's official business. Come on.
I'm Sheriff Hatton of Dodge City.
I've got a prisoner here for Wichita.
- Is it all right if we ride with you?
- All right, Sheriff.
- Mind shutting and locking this door?
- Not a bit.
Get over there.
You can sit there and rest your face and hands.
How many stops do you make between here and Wichita?
- None.
- Good.
Keep going. I'll tell you what to do.
Put 'em up.
- But, gentlemen...
- Take him away, Joe.
Get in there.
Get your hands up.
Get them up, I said!
Now unlock those cuffs.
We've gotta stop. The train's on fire.
Don't slow down till the water tower.
Hold it, Jeff! We're all gonna burn.
Got a friend of yours here, Hatton.
Take a good look.
Throw me those guns!
Pick them up.
Unlock those handcuffs!
Come on! Hurry up!
Close that door.
Rusty, this end.
Look out!
Hurry up!
So the lamb killed the butcher.
Now, listen to that.
Singing hymns and it ain't even Sunday.
No one in sight even friendly drunk.
Doggone, if this place ain't getting so pure and noble it ain't fit to live in.
I'm sure enough going back to Texas now.
Imagine asking me to lead the Pure Prairie League.
Why not? You're one of the leading lights in it, I hear.
First thing you know, they'll be starting a chamber of commerce.
- Faith, it's not possible.
- What?
Look, Col. Dodge.
- Hello, Colonel.
- How're you, Colonel?
Hi, Colonel.
How are you, boys?
By golly, Wade, it's good to see you alive.
- It's good to be alive.
- Come on up.
- Hello, Colonel.
- Wade. By golly, son, it's good to see you.
Hello, Tex. How are you, Rusty?
I couldn't complain, Colonel.
Wouldn't do no good.
Sit down over there, sir.
I've come all the way from Virginia City,
Nevada, just to see you.
I'm building a railroad there from San Francisco.
It's the richest square mile on earth.
Gold, silver, copper.
We've got a solid mountain of the stuff.
But it's a bad town, Wade.
A wild, murderous town.
Worse than Dodge City ever was before you cleaned it up.
And that's saying a good deal.
- I want you to come back with me.
- I knowed our luck had changed.
We've got 4,000 people out there.
Decent men and women with families who are living in terror.
Think of them 4,000 poor people.
There might be more by the time we get there.
We need you, son.
The city is teeming with crime and corruption.
What law we've tried has failed... because the men behind it hadn't the brains and courage to back it up.
You can get plenty of men for that job out here, Colonel.
I'm getting married next week.
Got tickets for New York.
Shucks, you can get married anytime.
We'll even go on your honeymoon with you to Virginia City.
Thanks.
Getting married has ruined a lot of good men.
Doesn't it mean anything to you to know... that someplace there's terror and death that you could put a stop to?
Yes, it does, Colonel.
But the decision isn't as simple as that.
If I were free, it might be different.
I'll soon have a wife to take care of.
Abbie doesn't want to go pioneering anymore.
We're planning on coming back here from New York and settling down.
There's a wagon train leaving here the middle of next week for Nevada.
It'd be a great trip, wouldn't it?
Hello, darling. I was just telling the boys how we're going to settle down...
- Lemonade?
- Thank you.
- Lemonade?
- Thank you, ma'am.
Darling, I was just telling Col. Dodge about our honeymoon in New York.
How we're going to see all the shops, theatres, and Niagara Falls, and things.
Col. Dodge, when do we start for Virginia City?
Wade, it looks like you're marrying the right girl.
Virginia City!

Get up. Get up. Come on.
Get up. Get up!
Get up there.
Get up there.
Come on, there. Now push hard, gentlemen, will ya?
Push hard.
Come on. Yo-yo!
Come on, there.
Come on, there.
Ah, blimey.
Hey, Joe, what o'clock is it?
Uh, it must be nearly 11.
Eleven. And we ain't atop of Shooter's Hill yet?
Push.
Come on, now. Yo-ho!
Yo-ho! Hey!
Come on.

[HORSE
APPROACHING]
Aye, Joe.
What do you say it is, Tom?
Well, I say it's a horse coming up at a canter.
Well, I say it's a horse coming up at a gallop.
Gentlemen, in the king's name, on guard, all of ya.
Dover mail.
Are you the Dover mail?
Never mind what we are.
What are you?
I'm a messenger from Tellson's Bank.
Stand! No nearer.
I wants Mr. Jarvis Lorry.
I've got a message for him from his bank.
Uh, here I am.
Is that Jerry Cruncher?
Right you are, sir.
Stop! Keep where you are.
It's quite all right.
I know him.
Well, step over and speak to him if you must, but don't let him come no nearer.
You never know these days.
What is the message,
Jerry?
The message is to wait at the Royal George for mademoiselle.
Ah. She'll be at Dover.
Give this reply to the office, Jerry:
"Recalled to life."
"Recalled to life."
Right you are, sir.
Did you hear the message, sir?
I did.
What did you make of it?
Nothing at all.
That's a coincidence too.
That's what I made of it, myself.
Now then, gentlemen, all together, please.
Hot gravy, sir?
No, no, no.
The young lady you were expecting, sir,
Miss Manette...
Ah, yes.
She has arrived, sir.
Good.
Uh. Business.
Strictly business.
Of course, sir.
I'm from Tellson's Bank in London, and it is business.
Eh, quite, quite.
I am Mr. Jarvis Lorry Jr. of Tellson and Company,
Bankers.
Your, uh, humble servant, miss.
Yes, I-- I received a letter from the bank, sir, informing me that some intelligence, some discovery--
Uh, the word is not material, miss.
Either one will do.
Are you quite a stranger to me, sir?
Uh, Miss Manette,
I am a man of business.
Pay no more attention to me than if I were a machine.
I am not much else.
But I know you.
I'm sure I know you.
Uh, yes. Uh, when you were a little girl,
I was instrumental in bringing you and your mother over to England.
Uh-- Uh, no romance.
Uh, business, you know.
No room for sentiment in business.
Yes.
That was 17 years ago.
Yes, uh-- I speak, miss, of that time.
Our business today... has to do with your father, Dr. Manette.
You knew him before he died?
Before--? Uh...
Y-y-y-yes. Yes, he was a client of Tellson and Company's
Paris bank.
I am an arm of that bank.
That is how you will regard me.
A mere mechanical arm of Tellson and Company.
Mr. Lorry... what have you come to tell me?
Now, let us suppose that your father had not died.
Suppose--
Uh, d-don't be afraid, child.
Mr. Lorry... please do not keep me in suspense.
What is it?
Uh, if your father had not died.
If he had suddenly and silently disappeared.
If he had an enemy who caused him to be imprisoned.
I entreat you, sir.
Pray-- Pray, tell me.
No, no, no.
Don't kneel, child.
In heaven's name, why should you kneel to me?
For the truth, oh, dear, good, compassionate sir.
For the truth.
Mr. Lorry... is my father alive?
Yes, child.
Well...
Where is he?
Uh, you will find him greatly changed.
A wreck it is probable, though we will hope for the best.
My father...
My poor, poor father...
Now you know the best and the worst.
You will see this poor wronged gentleman.
Then with a fair sea voyage and a fair land voyage--
Yeah-- Uh-- What is the matter?
Uh, Miss Manette, my dear child.
What are you doing to my Ladybird?
I-- I had to tell her some news.
You took a fine manner of doing it.
You, in brown, why couldn't you tell her without frightening her to death?
See what you've done to her.
You call that being a banker?
I tried to break it as gently as I could.
Gently?
I'd like to see you break things roughly.
Oh, my pretty.
My sweet.
Pross is with you now.
Heh-heh.
No one can harm you.
My darling.
I assure you, madam,
I had no intention--
I am not "madam."
I'm Miss Lucie's companion, and I'm Miss Pross.
But, madam,
I assure you that-- I'm--
I'm all right.
Of course you're all right.
It was a shock.
The man has no sense blurting out whatever he was blurting out, as if he were calling coals.
Please, Miss Pross.
Where is my father?
He has been imprisoned at the Bastille 18 years.
Eighteen years.
Gracious creator of day.
To be buried alive for 18 years.
But I entreat you, sir, where is he now?
Uh, an old servant of his, De Farge, is taking care of him.
But where? Where?
In his wine shop in Paris.
You must take me to him at once.
Well, why do you stand there like a nincompoop?
You hear, don't you?
Well--
She wants to be taken to her father.
Isn't it natural she should want to see her father?
I-I will, but--
Wine! Wine!
- Wine!
- Wine!
Ah, wine!
A toast to the king's health.
There's mud in it.
There's food in it.
Drink, little one.
Never mind the taste.
How can men bear such poverty?
Bear it? Look.
They live within the very shadow of the Bastille.
They have to bear it.
Don't do that,
Jacques.
Well, there'll be blood flowing in these streets before long,
De Farge.
Yes. But keep that thought in your heart, Jacques.
Don't waste it on the walls.
You're right,
Jacques.
Jacques, where do you want this wood?
In the loft?
Jacques 116, from Bordeaux.
Welcome, Jacques.
Come inside.
A hundred and sixteen from Bordeaux, my wife.
Well, Jacques, do you see the way the spilt wine is being sucked up?
Every drop.
It's not often those poor beasts know the taste of wine, or of anything but black bread and death.
It is so throughout all France.
Has he seen our tenant upstairs?
Not yet.
But I'll show him.
Eighteen years imprisoned in the Bastille.
Wait till you see him.
The sight will burn into the souls of all of the name of Jacques.
[CARRIAGE
APPROACHING]
Strangers.
The rose.
Madame De Farge?
Recalled to life.
Yes, yes. We have some very fine old wine upstairs.
My husband will show you.
Come.
You were too young to remember me.
I was his servant.
Whe--?
Where is he?
Is he greatly changed?
Changed, mademoiselle.
Changed.
You lock him in?
Why?
He's lived so long that way, that an open door would...
Is it possible?
All things are possible in France today... just as all things will be possible later.
Don't come in to him yet.
Let us go first.
Still hard at work?
Yes, I--
I am working.
These shoes must be done.
You have a visitor, you see.
A visitor.
Show your work to monsieur.
It is a lady's shoe.
It is a young lady's walking shoe.
It is in the present mode.
I never saw the mode.
I did it from a drawing.
Dr. Manette.
Do you remember me?
Come, come, now.
You remember an old friend in Tellson's Bank in London?
No.
No.
Who are you?
Who are you?
It is the same.
But how can it be?
It is the same.
But she is dead.
Yes.
My mother is dead... but I am...
Can't you feel who I am?
She had laid her head on my shoulder... and when I was brought to the North Tower... they found... hair like this... on my sleeve.
How was this?
Was it you?
I'm Lucie.
Her daughter.
Your daughter.
Do you think he's fit to make a journey to England?
Get him out of France for his sake.
And for the sake of the Jacquerie who rescued him.
What is this Jacquerie?
One day you will know.
All France will know.
You're coming with me, Father.
Wait.
Wait.
W-w-w-where is the place?
Mm, the brick was here by the bench.
It's gone.
What's he looking for?
Something he wrote in the Bastille.
And it was left in his cell?
No. We found it.
A reminder of such horror, it's better he should never see it again.
Oh.
Father, dear... we shall find it.
You're coming with me now. Home.
Home...
No one saw a coach leave here. You understand?
Eighteen years in a cell without a trial because an aristocrat chose to brush the good doctor from his path.
Too bad we don't know which aristo it was.
But I do know.
I have cause to remember.
His outrages against my own family would never let me forget.
Then you have his name on your register?
He has a place of honor.
The Marquis St. Evremonde.
Killed.
Dead.
The child is dead,
Excellency.
It's extraordinary to me that you people cannot take care of yourselves and your children.
One or the other of you is forever in the way.
How do you know what injury you might do to my horses?
Drive on, faster.
Irritating episode.
The marquis drives fast.
We'll drive him fast... to his tomb.
Now, my dear nephew, what goes forward here?
I'm leaving.
I'm going to England.
Really?
Monsieur Gabelle, when you were my nephew's tutor, you shouldn't have encouraged him to be so petulant.
You have made the name of Evremonde the most detested in all France.
I can't endure your cruelty to the peasants.
There is a sickness these days, which labels itself humanitarianism.
You have no pity for those who suffer.
Pity, my dear boy, is a diseased variety of sentimentality.
Do you pity the swine whose flesh we eat?
The peasants are not swine.
That, my dear Charles, is where you and I differ.
I'm very much afraid, my good tutor, that you have taught my nephew to take the new philosophy of equality seriously.
Now, I enjoy
Monsieur Voltaire and these other modern philosophers, but I--
I take them lightly and merely as an exercise for the mind.
Most of our lands are stolen.
I intend to see them returned to the peasants to whom they rightfully belong.
Really?
Thank your stars that you're related to me, Charles, or you might find yourself in the Bastille.
Monseigneur...
I pray you overlook the impulsiveness of youth.
Uncle, I'm not frightened of anything you can do.
Charles, I beg of you.
I'm not at all sure that it wouldn't be the patriotic thing to imprison you, Charles... in spite of the pain it would cause me personally.
By the bye... if you should run into any difficulties in England, let me know.
The prisons, even in that utopia, are very uncomfortable, they tell me.
A pleasant journey...
Mr. Darnay.
What did he mean by that?
Steel hand in the velvet glove.
But he's capable of anything.
I'm not troubled,
Gabelle.
Charles... let me go with you.
I can't take you now.
But someday we'll be together.
God bless you,
Charles.
On the boat to England, you say, Morveau?
Do you think it can be done on the boat to England?
Darnay will be arrested the day he lands.
You are ingenious, Morveau.
I like your plan.
Proceed with it.
Very well,
Your Excellency.
The boy's capricious.
He needs correction.
Yes,
Your Excellency.

Here we are, Dr. Manette, safe in England.
And you've borne the voyage like a seasoned traveler.
It's been... a pleasant voyage.
Your kindness has done me good. Mm.
Much good.
It's nice to be one's self again.
Believe me,
Miss Manette,
I'm sorry the voyage is ending.
And I-- I can't tell you how glad I am your hatbox fell into the water at Calais.
Mm. Really,
Mr. Darnay.
Oh, I only meant that it--
Rescuing it gave me the opportunity to meet you and...
And your father.
And it gave me the opportunity to hear your instructive discourse on George Washington and the rights of man.
Now you're making sport of me, Miss Manette.
Oh, no, Mr. Darnay.
It was most edifying.
Ahoy, ashore.
All right, lad. Hand me me luggage, my bag.
Get back.
Sorry.
There we are. Hurry up, lad.
Good. That's it.
Bon voyage.
Barsad.
Shh!
Now to find the carriage, and... then for London.
Eh, doctor?
I wonder,
Miss Manette, if I may presume to call upon you at your home?
On such short acquaintance?
Oh, Mr. Darnay.
Certainly a-- A crossing from Calais in this fog cannot be called short acquaintance.
Do let me see you again.
Lucie, dear. Ready?
Yes, Father.
Thank you, Mr. Darnay, for all your kindness.
Goodbye then until Sunday.
Sunday?
I told father I was inviting you to sup with us on Sunday at our house in Soho.
Goodbye.
Goodbye, young man, until Sunday.
Which one is Evremonde?
That's him there.
But he calls himself Darnay.
Charles Darnay.
And I tell you the marquis is going to make it well worthwhile for the both of us.
Really. Not working yet, Carton?
This is too much.
You've gotta put your mind on this case.
No. Not possible.
They've got this Charles Darnay up for treason.
I don't know
Charles Darnay.
I hate treason,
I hate Frenchmen.
For that matter,
I hate Englishmen.
Yes, yes. But Lorry sent this case on to us with a special request for all my consideration.
Uh, it's not my consideration he wants, it's yours.
Why don't you give it to him? Give it to him.
Carton, of course, I count on you for a little help.
You don't need me.
You're the great barrister Stryver.
Stryver of the King's Bench Bar.
Well, if I am, it's due to perseverance.
I had to get into the front rank.
I wasn't born there, was I?
I used my brains.
You use mine, you mean.
Well, if I do,
I pay you for it.
Well, not enough to justify your interfering with my drinking.
But this is a treason case.
It's a matter of life and death.
Well, so's everything else. What of it?
Carton, I beg of you... have a look at this brief.
Really, Carton, with a man's life in your hands, how can you hesitate?
I don't hesitate.
But I tell you,
Darnay is lost.
We have to find a way to counteract the evidence of these witnesses,
Barsad and Cly.
Barsad and Cly.
Cly and Barsad.
Barsad and Cly.
A case like that could be tried on mere sound.
What are you talking about?
Well...
Barsad and Cly, or Cly and Barsad, by the very sound of their names, by the build of their syllables, are manifestly villains.
Just as the other fellow--
The-- The defendant, what was his name?
Darnay. Charles Darnay.
Ah.
Equally manifestly a gentleman.
But you can't convict a man on syllables.
On the sound of his name.
Barsad.
Barsad.
I seem to know that name.
Wasn't he involved in a... treason case once before?
Barsad. Yes, he was.
I believe we've uncovered something here,
Carton.
Well, Mr. Darnay, fate and Mr. Barsad have it that I should handle your case.
Your life is in my hands.
I may lead you to fortune or the grave.
Who knows? And who cares?
I wish you'd stop drinking, or I wouldn't give much for Mr. Darnay's fortune.
You know...
I shouldn't wonder that-- That Cruncher--
Jerry Cruncher, knows this fellow, Barsad.
I think I'll call on Jerry.
I can't have you hobnobbing with a fellow like Jerry Cruncher.
Why, he's a grave robber.
Now, Stryver, a man who employs me shouldn't be a snob.
But he's a grave robber.
No, you don't discern the facts.
The very pith and marrow escape you.
Do you know the most interesting thing to me about this case?
Saving an innocent man from a horrible death.
No. It's that Cruncher probably knows the tavern that Barsad drinks at.
That means I can pursue this case in a congenial atmosphere.
You're in luck, Stryver.
I'll lay you a wager.
I'll drink you a victory.
Oh, dear Lord, don't let him be a grave robber.
Have mercy on his soul.
Don't let him be a grave robber.
Oh, dear God...
Bust me if she ain't at it again.
Flopping yourself down and praying against my prosperity.
Oh, Jerry, how can
I keep from praying now that I know what your real business is?
Listen, Aggerawayter,
I won't have me wittles blessed off me table by your praying.
A grave robber.
Don't say that word.
I'm a resurrectionist, that's what I am.
Doing a noble service for the medical profession, besides making a bit of money for meself.
So that's why your fingers is always rusty, Father.
Quiet, you.
You're an unnatural wife and an unnatural mother, praying against me.
I wasn't praying against you.
I was praying for you.
And I tell you I won't be took the liberty with.
You've got a fine mother, you have, young Jerry, praying that the bread and butter be snatched out of the mouth of her only child.
Father, I think she's flopping again.
What, more flopping?
No, no, no. I--
I was meditating.
And I won't have you meditating neither.
Prayed against and meditated against in me own home.
Uh, Jerry...
How are you,
Mr. Carton?
Not rusty, huh?
Oh, no, sir.
Good.
You'll never see 'em rusty again, Mr. Carton.
Jerry, do you know a man called Cly?
Cly?
No, I don't believes I do, sir.
Ah.
Know anybody called Barsad?
Oh, Barsad.
I knows him, sir.
A great fellow for bowling.
Where do I find him?
Well, you might find him bowling down at Puffey's.
Good.
But if you're going to meet him, Mr. Carton, you won't be keeping very good company.
Hm, neither will
Mr. Barsad. Ha.
Hey. Whose idea was it?
Mine.
I did all the brainwork.
Oh, I see.
Told 'em where to hold up the coach and when to shoot the coachman.
And after doing all that for them, what do you think they did, Barsad?
Run away with the swag?
Oh-- Oh-- Oh, Barsad, where did you learn so much of human nature?
In a really hard school of experience. Ah.
I don't believe in nobody,
and I don't trust nobody.
That's right.
Made up my mind. Same thing.
Nobody. Never trust nobody.
But them swine, did you get back at 'em?
Did I get ba--?
Ho-ho!
Did I fix something up on them.
Did you plant something on 'em?
Plant-- Oh, you got a brain, Barsad.
You got a brain.
What did you plant on 'em?
Shh.
If I tell you where I last saw them, maybe you'll guess what I planted on them.
Where'd you see 'em?
Outside
Newgate Prison.
Newgate?
Shh.
With my own eyes.
First hung up.
And then quartered.
Drawn and quartered?
Like animals, drawn and quartered.
You guessed it,
Barsad.
Now-- Now, let that brain of yours work out what
I planted on them.
Treason.
You got 'em for treason.
Mm.
You're a great man, Barsad.
You've guessed it.
Treason, eh?
Now, Barsad, match that if you can.
Right. I will match it.
If you'll take the trouble to go to the Old Bailey tomorrow, you'll have the pleasure of seeing a young Frenchman by the name of Darnay, up for treason. Oh.
Put there by no other than your humble servant.
No. Oh, if that's true,
I take my hat off to you, Barsad.
Then doff it right now.
Wait till I tell you how I did it.
No, no, another drink first.
There's plenty of time.
No, no, no.
Now, let me tell you.
Now, Mr. Barsad, will you please tell us, uh, in your own way, just what happened on the boat.
Just how your attention was first attracted to the prisoner.
Well, sir,
I was, uh, strolling about, having a bit of exercise when I passed a cabin door which happened to be open.
I looked down, and I noticed some papers on the floor.
Oh, I thought they might be valuable.
So thinks I to meself:
"Here's my opportunity to do a good turn for some poor chap."
You know, I-- I likes doing that sort of thing.
Do not delay, my good man.
Just get to the incriminating facts.
Yes, milord.
I picked up the papers.
And imagine my astonishment when I discovered that they were lists of His Majesty's forces,
God bless him.
And, uh, what was your motive in turning these papers over to the police?
My duty, sir.
Your duty to your country?
Yes, sir.
Your duty as a patriotic Englishman.
Your duty as a shining citizen.
I say, milord... that were statues decreed in Britain as they were in ancient Greece and Rome to public benefactors, this noble citizen...
...would most assuredly have one.
Your Honor, I protest.
Must we have a statue, or would you be satisfied with just a bust?
Silence in court.
No levity, gentlemen.
That's all, Mr. Barsad.
Your witness.
"No questions now.
Later on, if you're not too silly, we'll--"
No questions now.
Beg pardon, milord.
Here are the lists, milord, if you care for them.
Have these been in the prisoner's possession?
Yes, milord.
Oh, dear.
Can't be too careful, you know.
Jail fever.
Very prevalent.
I now call
Miss Lucie Manette.
Miss Manette. Have you seen the prisoner before?
Oh, most unhappily, yes.
Answer the questions put to you.
Make no remark upon them.
Where did you first meet him?
When the gentleman came on board, I--
If you mean the prisoner, say "the prisoner."
The prisoner noticed that my father was in a very weak state of health.
He was very kind and good to my father.
To us both.
I hope I won't repay him by doing him harm today.
It's your duty to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.
Prisoner understands that.
Or should.
The prisoner was overheard to make some remark about America.
What was it?
Be particular.
He tried to explain to me the quarrel between
England and America, and said that it might have been avoided had England been less rash and more understanding.
Oh. He, uh...
He made treasonable remarks like that, you see?
Yes, but there was no harm in the way he said this.
It was said only to beguile the time.
Oh, we'll leave that for the jury to decide.
That will be all,
Miss Manette.
Your witness.
No questions, milord.
With your permission, milord,
I'd like to call the witness, Barsad, again.
Mr. Barsad. Did you discuss this case with Mr. Cly last night?
Last night?
Why, sir,
I-- I haven't seen Mr. Cly since last Sunday's services.
Services.
My guess is he stole the collection box.
Where were you last night?
At home. Working.
Working, Mr. Barsad?
Just what is your profession?
Gentleman.
Retired, of course.
And on what do you live?
On my property.
Where is it?
Well, I--
I haven't any just now.
Oh, then at present you're not living.
Silence in court.
Really, Mr. Stryver,
I don't see that these questions are at all relevant.
Mr. Barsad, have you ever been kicked?
Certainly not.
Come, come, Mr. Barsad.
Weren't you one time kicked down stairs?
Well...
Once I was kicked at the top of the stairs.
But I fell down the stairs of my own will and volition.
Wasn't that kick the result of your stealing a silver teapot?
I was maligned about a mustard pot.
But it turned out to be only plated.
Oh, I see.
You were maligned.
Do you know a French marquis?
No, sir.
No?
A relative of the prisoner's?
No, sir.
No?
And now, Mr. Barsad,
I want to ask you the vital question.
The attorney general has told us that this whole case rests upon the identification of a certain man whom you say is the prisoner.
A man whom you saw enter the cabin on the Dover boat.
Now, I want you to be very, very careful.
After all, all we want is the truth.
Now... are you quite certain that the man you saw was the prisoner?
Yes, sir.
Couldn't have made a mistake?
No, sir.
Couldn't have mistaken him for me, for instance?
Oh-- Oh, no, sir.
Or his lordship, perhaps?
Oh, tut, tut, tut. Piffle.
No, sir.
Well, then, could you have mistaken him for my learned friend here?
Why, uh...
Ah, now you seem to think otherwise.
Will milord bid my learned friend lay aside his wig for a minute?
I don't think it's necessary, but if Mr. Carton doesn't mind, and won't catch cold in his head...
Now, Mr. Barsad, couldn't you have mistaken the prisoner for
Mr. Carton there?
No, I-- Ahem.
Well, sir... come to think of it, as a matter of fact, it was not the prisoner at all, sir.
That's all, milord.
As far as I'm concerned, it's quite sufficient.
Gentleman. Bah!
The jury will retire and consider their verdict.
I shall never understand how you got that fellow to change his evidence.
Oh, I just have a way of getting at the essence of the facts.
The pith and marrow, as it were.
Oh, really?
Oh, yes, quite so, quite so.
Oh, Mr. Carton.
If you'll excuse me.
Charles--
Mr. Darnay
--will be acquitted, won't he?
If the jury understands evidence, Charles--
Mr. Darnay
--will be acquitted.
Mr. Stryver's defense was brilliant.
Wonderful. If he does get off, it'll be entirely due to Mr. Stryver, won't it?
Nothing to it.
Mere professional claptrap.
Young sir, give credit where credit is due.
Oh. Uh,
Mr. Lorry...
I would like
Charles to know we wish him well.
Would you tell him for me?
No, I'd better.
It wouldn't do for respectable businessmen, especially bankers, to be seen talking to the prisoner.
Might tell against the prisoner.
Uh-- Upstart.
Mm.
Silence in court.
Gentlemen of the jury, have you agreed upon your verdict?
We have.
What is your verdict?
Not guilty.
The prisoner at the bar, the jury has found you not guilty.
Prisoner dismissed.
I'm so glad.
So very glad.
Charles. Charles, my boy.
Glad to have got you off with honor, my friend.
You saved my life.
Never any other outcome possible.
Barsad and Cly.
Cly and Barsad.
Why, I could have told from the very sound of their names, from the very run of the syllables, that they were...
Well, uh, anyway, it was all very simple, really.
Well, Mr. Stryver... shows you can't tell brains by appearance.
Hey!
Uh, Barsad.
As between fellow artists, why not try another country?
Uh, yes, sir.
Yes, Mr. Carton.
I think I should love to travel.
Perhaps France.
Or you might like to go even further. Say, China.
Never trust nobody.
Goodbye.
Goodbye,
Miss Manette.
My boy, never for a moment did I doubt your innocence. Ha.
So, Mr. Lorry, respectable men of business may speak to Mr. Darnay in public, now he's acquitted.
You had mentioned that before, sir.
We men of business must think of the house we serve more than ourselves.
Yes, yes.
Banking, of course, imposes its own restrictions and silences.
And, indeed, sir,
I don't know that it is any of your business.
Oh, bless you,
I have no business.
And if you had, sir,
perhaps you would attend to it.
Lord, love you, no,
I wouldn't.
Uh-- Oh.
Mr. Darnay, you're a very fortunate young man.
I beg your pardon, sir.
Well, it's not long since you were well advanced on your way to another world.
Oh. I'm--
I'm very grateful to
Mr. Stryver and to you.
Would you--? Would you care to dine with me?
No, I don't dine.
But I'll wine with you.
Well, Mr. Darnay, how does it feel to belong to this terrestrial scheme again?
To taste, to feel, to be alive?
It's very agreeable.
Ah. I'm glad you find it so.
Why? Don't you?
I? Oh.
Matter of fact, Mr. Darnay,
I care for no man.
And no man cares for me.
You seem to be rather bitter today.
I suppose you were up all night.
All night.
No sleep, I'll wager.
Not a wink.
Just drinking.
Very sad.
Just drinking.
For no reason?
For no reason.
Well. Pardon me, but--
But why do it?
You are smug, Mr. Darnay, when you ask why people drink.
But I'll tell you.
So that they can stand their fellow men better.
After a few bottles,
I might even like you.
You've been kind to me, and I'll not reward your kindness by taking offense.
There's a good fellow.
A toast, then.
Let's drink a toast.
Drink...
...to the person that's nearest your heart.
To the person--?
The one you're thinking of now.
But I don't know--
Oh, come now, man.
It's on the tip of your tongue.
Very well.
To Miss Manette.
Miss Manette.
There's a fair young lady to hand to a coach in the dark.
There's a fair young lady to be pitied by and wept for by.
Ah.
Must be worth being tried for one's life to be the object of such sympathy and compassion.
Well.
Miss Manette.
Oh, waiter.
A glass.
Tell me, Mr. Darnay... do you think
I particularly like you?
I've not asked myself that question.
Well, ask it now.
I thought you did, but you're acting now as if you don't.
Hm.
I begin to have a better opinion of your understanding.
Waiter...
There's nothing in your dislike
I hope to prevent my settling for the dinner.
Oh, nothing in the world.
Let me have the record.
You... call the whole dinner?
I do.
In that case, waiter...
Uh, another bottle.
Good night, sir.
Good night.
And don't let your sober face elate you.
You never know what it may come to.
Why treat the fellow like that?
Is it because he shows you what you have fallen away from?
What you might have been?
Change places with him.
Would you have been looked at by those blue eyes as he was?
Ah, come on, Carton, you're jealous.
Have it out in plain words.
You hate the fellow.

Christmas, you know.
Home? Where can you better find the spirit of Christmas than a good old

But a tavern ain't a home.
No, at home you bicker and quarrel.
And here, it's all peace on earth, good will to men.
Drink up, gentlemen.
Good will to men.
Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas.
Really. What can be keeping Mr. Darnay?
A man who would be late for Christmas services would be late for his own wedding.
Charles told me he had to see Mr. Lorry about something important.
Important indeed.
Anything can be more important to a young man than going to church.
For meself, I'm very sorry to see Mr. Darnay go into Mr. Lorry's bank.
You all think it was a great kindness on Mr. Lorry's part.
But I don't, because I think Mr. Lorry is an atheist.
All bankers are atheists.
Good evening,
Mr. Darnay.
Good evening.
Merry Christmas,
Charles.
Merry Christmas, Lucie.
Merry Christmas, Miss Pross,
Dr. Manette.
Merry Christmas. We've been waiting for you.
Will you forgive me, Lucie, if I don't go with you to church?
I must speak to your father about--
About something that has arisen.
You're worried, Charles.
Oh, it's nothing serious, Lucie.
If only I could speak to Dr. Manette.
Uh, certainly.
Mr. Lorry has sent
Jerry Cruncher to light you and Miss Pross to the church.
We'll come back directly after the service.
You'll wait for us?
Yes, I--
Well, come along,
Lucie.
Not going to church, indeed.
Atheist.
Bankers and Frenchmen.
All atheists.
May I remind you... that the port on the sideboard is for the party after services and not for haphazard consumption.
Oh, Pross, do come along.
Won't you sit down, Charles.
I will not delay disclosing to you what I have to say,
Dr. Manette.
I have just learned from Mr. Lorry something that distresses me deeply.
It is a bitter irony, sir, that this man, who did you such a dreadful injustice... should be my blood relation.
Oh, I'm very sorry.
Can you understand that I--
That I had to tell you?
Yes.
I understand you had to tell me.
I am an Evremonde... but I love you and yours.
For you and Lucie
I would give up my life, if necessary.
Dr. Manette... can you find it in your heart to forgive me?
You showed character, Charles, in coming to me.
And I have no blame for you.
In suffering... one learns many things.
Among them, not to punish the innocent.
I shall never forget your kindness.
But you must promise me one thing, Charles.
Anything.
You must not tell Lucie.
But, sir, I must.
That would be--
You must let me tell her in my own way, in my own time.
Or you may spoil not only your own happiness, but hers.
Trust me, Charles.
It shall be as you wish, of course.
I don't like Mr. Lorry sending dozens of people to look after us we don't want.
If he's so anxious about us, why didn't he come himself?
Oh, no, not himself, the old atheist.
Now, you know perfectly well
Mr. Lorry is the soul of kindness.
Mr. Cruncher is his odd-job man.
Odd-job man, indeed.
From what I can gather, he's the oddest of odd-job men.
Oh, wait.
Good evening,
Mr. Carton.
Merry Christmas.
Oh, thank you,
Miss Manette.
Miss Pross, merry Christmas.
I'd say merry Christmas to you, Mr. Carton, if it weren't plain to see that you'd already had it.
Were you going to midnight service? We're going.
Do come with us.
Why not?
Thank you,
Miss Manette.
It's dangerous taking him to church, Miss Pross.
He'll forget where he is and call for a round of drinks.
Hold your tongue and hold that lantern higher, or I'll bash you with this umbrella.

You're making quite a tea drinker out of me, Prossie.
Aren't you ashamed?
I am Miss Pross.
And as for being ashamed, why should I be ashamed?
For giving you a decent home to come to, I suppose.
For saving you from the gallows, practically.
Ashamed, ha!
Indeed.
Oh, Miss Pross, heh, don't you think, at times, you're inclined to exaggerate just a trifle?
One of Prossie's most endearing gifts.
That's why
I love you.
I'll have you know
I'm not one of those flibberty-gibberties you can take liberties with.
No more liberties,
Prossie.
And I'll thank you to call me Miss Pross, or not address me at all.
You know, I believe you've completely captivated Pross.
She's part of the flavor of this house to me.
I couldn't imagine it without her, no more than without these paintings of yours.
It's beautiful.
Please don't look at it.
I know it's dreadful, but I do it.
That's like my drinking.
I know it's dreadful, but I do it.
There hasn't been quite so much of that lately, has there?
Oh...
With your influence.
Your visits here have meant so much to us, to Father and me.
And what do you think it's meant to me, my being able to come here and see you?
If we've helped you,
I'm glad.
Ah, it's you. It's you who have done it.
I've always felt in you such hidden possibilities.
It seems such a pity to--
To waste them?
Don't be afraid to say it.
I have wasted them and myself.
It's only now, after knowing you, that I've told myself that perhaps it's not too late.
I'm sure it's not.
After all, you're young.
Your whole life's before you.
Anything you want to accomplish...
Do you believe that?
Oh, I do.
Ah, it makes it worth the trying.
Thank you, Sydney.
That completes my happiness.
I wonder if you know how much your happiness means to me.
Oh, of course I do.
You're my very dearest friend.
Oh, I--
I must tell you...
What?
Can't you guess?
Guess?
I'm going to be married.
Charles Darnay.
Yes.
Aren't you going to wish me happiness?
Happiness, yes.
Yes, of course.
All that you deserve.
Amen.
I join you together in marriage in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, amen.
And now, for the first time,
Mrs. Darnay.
All my congratulations,
Dr. Manette. Ha-ha!
Dear, dear, dear.
This is an occasion that makes me speculate on all I may have lost.
To think there might have been a Mrs. Lorry any time these 50 years.
Please. You were a bachelor in your cradle.
You were cut out for a bachelor before your cradle.
I may have been so in my cradle, but since then, let me tell you, there have been occasions--
Mr. Lorry.
This is not the time or place for such confidences.
But...
Charles, have you seen Sydney?
Why, no.
Well...
I wonder why he didn't come to my wedding.
Why, Sydney, why didn't you come to the wedding?
Pleasant ceremonies, weddings.
You know, Sydney, come to think of it, you ought to get married.
Find yourself someone to take care of you, some respectable woman with a little property.
Landlady, lodging-house keeper.
Marry her against a rainy day.
Oh, must I spend my life listening to that eternal blithering, pompous voice of yours?
Drives me mad.
Tsk, tsk, tsk.
You certainly are a funny fellow.
I never know how to take you.
Suggest marriage to you, and you fly up.
If you'd only seen the joy in Lucie's eyes...
Why should that surprise me?
Why shouldn't she be happy?
Why shouldn't she be?
You are destined for more, Gaspard, than revenge for the murder of your child.
You may light a spark that will kindle all France.
I go.
He goes.
"Henri Dupont, 42 francs, quit rental."
Not enough,
Gabelle.
With what I get from these peasants,
I can hardly afford to pay my perfume bills.
What about Roulet?
Has he paid his rent?
No, Your Excellency, nor will he.
Roulet died last week.
Now, that was impertinent of him.
He died with his rent unpaid.
What did he die of?
Hunger.
Hunger is an indulgence with these peasants, as gout is with us.
It is an indulgence they would gladly dispense with,
Monseigneur.
Oh. Oh, I keep forgetting,
Gabelle. You're a--
You're a humanitarian, aren't you?
You think that one person is as good as another.
A naive notion, so contradicted by the facts.
But, uh, speaking of, uh--
Speaking of humanitarians, what has become of your disciple, my nephew, in the year since he left my tyrannical roof?
Do you hear from him,
Gabelle?
Oh, yes.
He is very happy.
He has taken a post at Tellson's Bank.
Frightfully bourgeois.
If it weren't that my sister,
Charles' mother, were quite beyond reproach,
I should suspect that Charles had tainted blood somewhere.
His conduct is so strange.
It's quite mystifying.
What was that, Gabelle?
What,
Your Excellency?
I thought I saw somebody at the window.
Go and see.
Certainly.
There was nothing,
Monseigneur. Hm.
Good night.
Gentlemen.
Monsieur Gabelle.
Your forgiveness, gentlemen.
I'm certain you wouldn't have me put promptness before gallantry.
It's of no consequence.
Believe me, no consequence.
Monsieur Gabelle here has been trying to frighten us with hobgoblins, werewolves and mythical revolutionists.
Proceed,
Monsieur Gabelle.
You may laugh, gentlemen, but revolution is in the air.
Yet there is still time to remove the cause of this unrest.
All the people ask is justice.
Only the Jacquerie, the extremists, are spreading the doctrine of violence and bloodshed.
And what do you suggest,
Gabelle?
That we double the police force?
Double the police?
No. Give the people bread.
Reduce their taxes.
Oh, I-- I beseech you, gentlemen, correct your errors or the flood will come, a flood that may sweep us all away forever.
His terror is genuine, gentlemen, even if his philosophy is not.
Remember your own terror five years ago when my master met his death?
And remember also, gentlemen, that the Jacques who killed him is still at liberty.
Enough of this, Gabelle.
I have a new agent in Paris, a smart Englishman, who will ferret out this murderer.
Our gracious king also has seen the necessity for stronger measures.
He has brought German hussars and Swiss infantry into Paris to give your Jacques a good drubbing, Monsieur Gabelle.
Mercenaries to fight Frenchmen?
More delicate than to slaughter them ourselves, don't you think?
Ha-ha-ha-ha!
Shall we rejoin the ladies, gentlemen?
How I loathe intellectuals like this fellow, peasants who read.
I think he's right about the peasants.
How many thousands of these foreign soldiers are they bringing in?
It doesn't matter how many.
It will do them no good.
It'll do them no good. Ha!
The starving people of Paris might wait a long time before rising up to fight French soldiers.
But against hired foreign troops, hmph, any day, any hour.
Any minute.
Want this wood in the loft?
Aristo spy.
Used to be with Evremonde.
Name is Barsad.
Good day.
Cognac, the very best.
Never mind the cost.
These foreign soldiers--
They march well, don't they?
Very well.
You, uh, knit with great skill, madame.
What sort of things do you make?
Everything, mostly shrouds.
Shrouds?
Business seems bad.
Business is very bad.
People are so poor.
Ah, the unfortunate, miserable people.
And so oppressed too, as you say.
As you say.
Pardon me.
Certainly it was I who said so, but of course, naturally you think so.
I think?
All we think here is how to live.
Oh. Good health, Jacques.
My name is Ernest De Farge.
De Farge? Oh.
Didn't you used to work for Dr. Manette?
Yes.
You know, I met him in England.
He has a charming daughter.
Little grandchild now too.
Grandchild?
Oh, yes.
His daughter married
Charles Darnay.
You must remember him.
He's the nephew of the Marquis St. Evremonde.
You must have known the Marquis.
No. Why should I?
Well, when the Marquis was killed some years ago, his death was applauded in this neighborhood.
You remember that, Jacques?
You make a mistake when you call my husband Jacques.
His name is Ernest.
I don't want to make a mistake in your name.
Are there two D's in Barsad?
I don't believe it.
It can't be true, what he said of Mademoiselle Manette.
No.
If he has said it, it's probably false, but it may be true.
No, no, it's not true.
If it is,
I hope for her sake that destiny will keep her husband out of France.
Her husband's destiny will lead him to the end that is to end him.
That is to end him.
I can't understand the doctor permitting such a marriage.
Or forgetting what Evremondes did.
The doctor may forget and the doctor may forgive, but I don't.
We don't.
I for one don't believe there will be a terror in France.
I count on the sanity and good temper of the people.
Well, the trouble is, the aristocrats weren't firm enough.
They should hang a few hoodlums, and that's all the revolution there will be.
That's the kind of talk that cost us the American colonies.
No comparison at all that I can see.
None. We lost the colonies because they fell under the spell of that upstart Washington.
Well, the time may come when the upstart Washington will be a better remembered
Englishman than George III.
Oh, stuff and nonsense.
You businessmen never read anything but your ledgers.
You're badly informed.
Oh, bless my soul.
And as for the French aristocrats, they're so blind they can't see the lightning in front of their eyes.
You mustn't make the mistake of thinking that all aristocrats are alike, Carton.
They differ as other classes do.
I agree.
Now, we of the younger generation of Tellson's Bank have been studying the French situation closely.
And we have come to the conclusion--
Oh, Miss Pross, may I congratulate you on the dinner.
I know I express the sentiments of all when I say that the roast tonight--
Is not up to your usual standard.
I suppose it not as good as the taverns you are used to.
From what I hear, none of you are strangers to taverns.
Mr. Carton, the infant has expressed a desire to say good night to you.
The infant's desire shall be gratified immediately, Prossie.
I suppose, uh, it's none of my business, but I wouldn't allow that fellow to handle a child of mine.
As to that, you haven't got one.
And by the looks of you, you're not likely to have one.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Shh.
She wanted so badly to say good night to you, but she fell asleep.
You're her favorite,
Sydney.
And she's mine.
She accepts me without criticism.
Never asks me where I've been or what I've been doing.
Doesn't even object to my drinking.
The perfect friend.
Shh.
You know, Sydney, sometimes it's the part of a friend to criticize too.
Well, when there's any hope of reformation, yes, but with me it's hopeless.
I don't believe it.
I refuse to believe it.
Oh, I admit that once when...
When I first knew you, the sight of you and your home stirred old shadows that
I thought had died out of me.
I had unformed ideas of striving afresh, beginning anew, fighting out the abandoned fight.
A dream that ended in nothing, but you inspired it.
Must it end in nothing?
I'm afraid so.
But for that inspiration and for that dream
I shall always be grateful to you, Lucie.
I feel in you still such possibilities.
No, they'll never be realized.
I am like one who died young.
I'll never give up my hopes for you, Sydney. Never.
I know myself better.
But this I know too:
I would embrace any sacrifice for you and for those dear to you.
Will you hold me in your mind as being ardent and sincere in this one thing?
Think now and then that there is a man who would give his life to keep a life you love beside you.
Thank you, Sydney.
God grant it may never be necessary.
Look at the crowd rushing to escape the storm.
Listen to the echoes.
You know, sometimes I've sat here of an evening until--
Until I've made the echoes out to be the echoes of all the footsteps that are coming by and by into my father's life and mine.
Meat. Yes, meat.
Stop it. Stop it!
Why do you endure it?
Why do you have to endure it?
Why?
Why?
Aristos.
Children of aristos.
Evremonde's lackey.
Living on the blood of peasants.
It's not true.
I've always fought for the people.
I taught Charles Darnay to love the people. Ask him.
Then why isn't he here?
Why isn't he here to testify for you?
Citizen Gabelle.
We know Citizen Darnay's views, that he's a friend of the people.
His word could save you.
But he's in England.
Why doesn't he return to testify for you?
If, as you say, you have taught him the views he holds, he should be willing to do that for you.
Write him.
His answer will be the test.
He will come.
I'm sure he will.
Pen. Paper.
Thank you, Citizen Gabelle.
Thanks for giving us an aristocrat.
His last will and testament.
I congratulate you on your ruse, citizens, but I beg of you,
I implore you, no matter what you do to me, spare Charles Darnay.
He is your friend.
The revolution will need friends.
Do you remember a child that was killed by the coach of your master, the Marquis Evremonde?
Why, yes.
Was that your child?
My child.
Oh, that was a dreadful thing, citizen.
Do you see this hand?
This is the hand that struck your master down.
Well, you can't blame me.
You lived with him.
You're his friend.
I see.
I'll not plead for justice for myself, but I implore you not to send that letter.
Charles Darnay is your friend.
He feels your sufferings.
He will feel them better and so will you.
Hurry up, you.
Come on here with that there mail.
What's been keeping you?
What's all the row,
Father?
Lots of foreigners about today.
Frenchies over here to save their heads and skins.
From what I hear,
France would be a fine place just now, for a resurrectionist.
You're developing too fast, me lad.
And stay off my stool.
Letter for you,
Mr. Darnay.
Thank you, Jerry.
Where do I arrange for a loan?
But you don't understand,
I want this loan on the finest house in the Rue St. Germain.
Everything will be attended to, but it takes time.
You can't hurry this house.
I demand immediate action.
My dear sir, young Mr. Tellson will see you, but you'll have to wait.
I want to see old Mr. Tellson.
No, no, no.
Mr. Tellson Senior hasn't seen anyone in 15 years.
But here comes
Mr. Tellson Jr.
Mr. Tellson, sir.
Aren't you going to pay any attention to my loan?
Indubitably.
Good morning.
Good morning, sir.
If you advise the bank to loan money to these aristocrats, you'll ruin Tellson's.
This is the best opportunity for business in years.
These people are so anxious to get loans, they'll put up twice the value for security.
Seems twice the value to you, but it's no security at all.
This business in France is a real revolution.
These people are putting up securities they won't own.
I was thinking along those same lines myself.
Well, Darnay.
Hello, Carton.
Lucie still in the country?
Yes, yes.
You seem upset.
Is everything all right?
Yes, of course.
Mr. Stryver, you see we are besieged for loans.
Our Mr. Lorry is in Paris reviewing the situation.
Advices are delayed.
Shall we advance any money at all, Mr. Stryver?
I shouldn't.
This is a real revolution in France, Mr. Tellson, and these securities, in my opinion, are no securities at all.
Don't you think so,
Carton?
Indubitably.
Huh?
Well, Mr. Carton, even though you do agree with Mr. Stryver,
I shall still risk his judgment. Ah.
Good day, sir.
Jerry.
Yes, sir?
When does the coach leave for Dover?
In half an hour, from the Golden Cross Inn, sir.
Does it meet the packet for France? Yes.
Reserve space for me immediately, will you?
Yes, sir.
"I know you will understand my obligation to my old tutor.
His life is at stake, and I cannot deny his appeal."
Oh. Isn't that just like Charles?
To drop everything and go to the aid of...
Father, what is it?
What's the matter?
I should have told you before, perhaps, Lucie.
What?
About Charles.
He is an Evremonde, a nephew of the notorious
Marquis St. Evremonde.
The man who--?
Father, the same man who--?
Yes, it was Charles' uncle who had me imprisoned in the Bastille.
Why didn't you tell me?
That is all past.
It is the present that troubles me.
Charles' danger.
Danger?
I heard only today that they passed a new law in France that the lives of all aristocrats who return to France are forfeit to the revolution.
What are we going to do?
We must follow him.
Yes.
Yes, of course we must.
Miss Pross.
Father, I'm frightened.
Yes, madame?
Send Miss Pross to me.
Yes, madame.
You needn't be frightened.
As a victim of the aristocrats,
I shall be welcome in France.
Yes. Yes, of course you will be.
How strange that I, who suffered by an Evremonde, must go to save an Evremonde.
Come, Father.
Charles Darnay?
Pass, Evremonde.
Take Evremonde to La Force Prison.
Take him away.
Wait! Prison?
Under what law?
For what offense?
We have new laws,
Evremonde, and new offenses since you were here.
But isn't there--?
Will you--?
Will you permit me to communicate with Mr. Lorry of Tellson's Bank who is now in Paris?
I will do nothing for you.
Take him away.
Can he see us, Father?
I'm sure he can.
You may kiss your hand towards that highest row of windows up there.
I do so, and I send my soul with it.
Goodbye, my dear.
I must go now and try to arrange for Charles' trial.
If he sees us, why doesn't he come down?
He will, darling, if we wait long enough.
Mummy, something white up there.
Yes, darling.
He sees us. Wave.
Former Count D'Etournelle, anything to say in your defense?
Nothing I could say would make any impression on you.
I prefer the dignity of silence.
He prefers the dignity of silence.
Vote, jury.
Guilty.
Guilty. Guilty.
Death within 48 hours.
Come on.
Buy a guillotine?
Guillotine?
Buy a guillotine?
What is your profession?
I am a seamstress, citizen.
You are accused of consorting with Pierre Cot, who spoke slightingly of the revolution.
He was my friend, citizen.
I grew up with him in the country.
Mm. You shouldn't have such friends, citizeness.
Vote, jury.
Guilty.
Guilty.
Guilty.
Guilty.
Death within 48 hours.
The Marquis St. Evremonde, called Darnay, suspected as an enemy of the republic.
Let him have the guillotine.
You're accused under the decree which forbids the return of all aristocrat emigrants under pain of death.
I am not an emigrant in that sense of the word.
Why not?
I relinquished my title before the revolution began.
For what reason?
I felt would rather live on my own industry in England, than on the already overburdened people of France.
A lot he cares about that.
Then why did you come back to France?
I came to save a friend of the people, who was unjustly accused.
I hope that is not criminal in the eyes of the republic.
No. No.
And the name of that citizen?
Citizen Gabelle.
Is he here?
I don't know.
Citizen Gabelle!
Citizen Gabelle!
Citizen Gabelle.
He's not here.
Well, why is he not here?
I-- I don't know.
Did you hear that, jury?
The man he came to save isn't here, and he doesn't know why he's not here.
Have you any other proof of equal value?
Dr. Manette will speak for me.
I'm sure he'll be able to influence them.
Dr. Manette, we all know you as one of the sufferers under the old regime.
What do you know of this prisoner?
You all know of my long imprisonment, how I was released by the aid of my good friends, the De Farges.
Citizens,
I know the prisoner well.
The last few years, we became very close friends.
I know where his sympathies are.
They are with you, the people.
They always were.
He is a true citizen of the republic.
Words are easy.
What better proof can I give you than when he asked for my only daughter's hand in marriage,
I gave my consent gladly.
Bad judgment.
He wants to spy on you.
No doubt about that.
Citizens, for 18 years,
I suffered unspeakable tortures in the Bastille.
Could I have given my only daughter to a man whose sympathies are with those who tortured me?
No. No.
There is very little left for me in this life, citizens.
Only my daughter's happiness, which is now in the hands of the prisoner.
I have suffered enough from my enemies.
From you, who are my friends, to whom I owe my liberty, may I not ask a final blessing?
May I not ask the liberty to enjoy what is left, in peace?
Free.
- Stop!
- Silence.
Citizeness, you're out of order.
I defy the bell.
What?
I accuse the man,
Evremonde, one of the family of tyrants who used their privileges for the oppression of the people.
Your witnesses?
Three.
Ernest De Farge.
Yes?
Therese De Farge.
Yes?
And Dr. Manette.
I protest, it is a lie.
Who dares to say that I denounce this man?
I do. That you denounce him in words that can never be taken back.
Look, citizens, the record of Dr. Manette's sufferings in the Bastille and the cause of them.
I make no accusations.
How can you say that when it is there in black and white?
Let me read it. Look.
"For all that the Evremondes made me suffer,
"for all that they have made the people suffer,
"I, Alexandre Manette, do, on this last night of the year,
"and in my unbearable agony,
"denounce the family of Evremonde, them and their descendants to the last of their race."
When was that written?
This was written in prison by Dr. Manette himself, in scrapings of soot and charcoal mixed with his own blood.
Cut his head off!
Dr. Manette has told you that he spent 18 years in solitary confinement in the Bastille.
This letter tells you why.
It tells how, as a young doctor, he was summoned to the bedside of a dying girl.
Dying because she'd been outraged by the Evremondes.
It tells how her young brother was cut down for daring to come to the defense of his sister.
It describes the agonies of those two innocent, young people.
That boy is dead.
That girl is dead.
All that peasant family but one died through the cruelty and oppression of the Evremondes.
All but one, a sister.
That sister was hidden from them, and she lives.
She lives today.
I am that sister!
And I demand the life of the last of the Evremondes!
I demand it.
But this boy had nothing to do with that.
Citizens. Vote.
Guilty! Guilty!
Guilty.
The accused is found guilty of being an enemy of the republic.
Citizen president, the citizens of the republic demand the death of the prisoner.
Granted.
Death within 48 hours.
Come on.
Charles. Charles.
Charles.
Charles!
Now, my good doctor, save him if you can.
Oh, merciful Creator, have pity on thy servant Charles.
He came here to save a life.
Save his.
"Louis Bach, merchant of Metz." Pass.
"Maria Fontanni, singer."
Singer.
Pass.
"Sydney Carton,
English advocate." Pass.
Right. Pass.
But it's incredible that the De Farges should have turned against Manette like that.
He regarded them as his best friends in Paris.
Every revolution breeds fanatics like Madame De Farge.
But how anyone could be cruel to Lucie I cannot understand.
Tell me, how is she?
How do you imagine she is with her husband condemned to die?
Why do you take up my time asking these questions?
What--? What good are these questions?
Forgive me if I notice that you are affected.
I shouldn't respect your sorrow more if you were my own father.
From that misfortune, however, you are free.
Indeed, that is one thing to be grateful for, I suppose.
When is the--?
The execution to take place?
Within 24 hours.
You're remaining long in Paris?
No, I've done all the good I can do here.
You're going to Lucie's,
I hope.
She must be very desolate tonight.
And she has such a strong attachment to you and reliance on you.
I'll be going directly.
I shall venture to go and see her later.
Perhaps there is something she would like me to do for her.
There's nothing for you to do that I can see.
I shall let her tell me so.
Perhaps we shall meet at Lucie's then.
Perhaps.
Hello, Mr. Carton.
How are you?
Hello, Jerry.
Better than the stool I had in London, eh, Mr. Carton?
Belonged to a duke, they say.
I paid two shillings for it.
What are you doing here?
Oh, I arrived with some documents for Mr. Lorry.
So I'm gonna stay here and do his errands like I did at home.
I suppose you heard about Mr. Darnay?
Yes.
Very sad.
You know, that couldn't happen in England, Mr. Carton.
Only the other day,
I was talking about this case with an old friend of yours, Mr. Barsad.
Is he here in Paris?
Is he here?
And very important.
He goes in and out of prisons like as if he was high and mighty.
He goes in any place.
He does, does he?
If you ask me, I think he's a sort of official, a spy of the prisons.
Ah.
And he's very prosperous, is Barsad.
Whatever you say about him, he's talented.
Put him anywhere, he'll get along.
You say a spy on the prisons.
What prison, for example?
Mostly La Force Prison.
La Force.
That information may be useful.
Good, sir.
All right, Jerry.
Glad to see you sitting on the last throne left in Paris.
Very fitting.
Thank you, sir.
I implore you to have pity on me.
You have such power.
It is still not too late for you to help me.
As a wife and mother,
I appeal to you.
We are wives and mothers, and did they think of us?
All our lives we suffered, and our children suffered poverty and nakedness, hunger, sickness, death.
No one showed us mercy.
Why should the troubles of one wife and mother mean anything to us now?
But I am not an aristocrat.
I'm the daughter of a country doctor.
I'm one of the people, just as you.
I don't trust members of the people who marry aristocrats.
I see that I can hope for nothing from you.
You have no pity, no pity.
No, citizeness, none.
I'll thank you to leave the child alone.
And what's more, don't grin at me, boldface.
Yes, there are still Evremondes.
Here, ladybird, drink this.
No.
Sydney, there is still hope, isn't there?
You think so, don't you?
Of course there's hope.
But Father's been gone for hours.
It might take a long time to see a man so important as Danton.
He would be able to see him, wouldn't he?
I'd be sure of it. Your father's reputation would affect that.
And Danton could save him if he wanted to, couldn't he?
Yes, Danton could save him.
Where did you get this,
Lucie?
A nice old lady gave it to me at the wine shop.
What wine shop is the child talking about?
The D-- The De Farge's.
We went there to--
You mean to say that the De Farges saw the child?
Merciful heaven.
Shh.
What is it?
Why are you whispering?
Father.
Father.
Have you--?
Have you seen him?
Have you seen Danton?
What--?
What name did you say?
Dan--
My work...
What have you done with my work?
My bench, tools, thread.
Haven't you any thread?
Father, have you seen him?
You left to see Danton.
How can I make my shoes if you don't give me any thread?
Father.
Don't you know me?
Charles.
You left to save Charles!
It's no use, my dear.
He doesn't understand you.
I'll take him to his room.
Not just now.
Say it.
Why not say it?
There's no hope now.
Where is Father?
Didn't you say he was going to bring back Father?
He's been delayed.
He'll be here soon.
I want my father.
Shh-shh-shh.
Come with Pross.
Come, come.
I want my father.
Shh-shh.
It's going to seem such a long time, Sydney.
Afterwards...
If only I could see him.
Just once.
I can't even do that.
Lucie, your father's calling for you.
Is there nothing we can do?
I think-- I know I can get to see Charles once.
You can? How?
Oh, I know of a man.
A way we drinking fellows have, we always know of a man.
I spent the afternoon with him.
But what earthly good would it do if you did see him?
You have your permit to leave Paris when you please?
Yes.
And Lucie and the doctor,
Miss Pross and Jerry, they have theirs.
Oh, you'd have to move fast.
But why? These passes are valid for any time.
Until canceled.
Canceled?
From what you've told me of Madame De Farge, the permits will be canceled.
But the doctor, Lucie, they are in no danger.
They are in great danger.
The doctor is suspected.
His behavior at the trial--
It's death for anyone to sympathize with the condemned.
And to that tiger Madame
De Farge, even the child--
Little Lucie?
It's unthinkable.
Look.
Take the doctor's permit and the others.
And here's mine.
Keep it for me until tomorrow.
I don't understand.
Ah, do as I ask.
Take the word of a drinking man for once.
What do you want me to do?
At 8:00 tomorrow, have your horses ready.
Start definitely at 8.
And if Lucie hesitates, you must force her.
Tell her that it's Darnay's wish that she leave Paris before the execution.
Do I wait for you?
Wait for nothing but to have my place occupied.
And then for England.
You don't wish to tell me anything more?
Carton, if I've misunderstood you before, believe me, I regret it.
You never misunderstood me, sir.
You were right.
Yours is a long life to look back on, Mr. Lorry?
I'm 78.
Long life. Useful one.
Uh, solitary bachelor.
Nobody will weep for me.
Wouldn't she weep for you?
Yes, thank God.
I didn't quite mean what I said.
It is a thing to thank God for, isn't it?
Tell me, if you looked back on that long life, and saw that you had gained neither love, gratitude, nor respect of any human being, it would be a bitter reflection, wouldn't it?
Why, yes, surely.
Would you mind if I borrowed that coat?
Certainly not.
Don't let anything she may say change your plans.
I hope to do my part faithfully.
And I hope to do mine.
Good night, lads.
Good night.
Sleep well.
Pleasant dreams.
Hey there.
You work late, Mr. Barsad.
Now, Mr. Carton, what it is you want, sir?
You know what I want.
Shh.
Mr. Carton,
I told you this afternoon that it can't be done.
No one's ever escaped from one of them prisons.
It can't be done.
Yes, yes. I believe that, but there is something that can be done.
You can get me an interview with the prisoner.
One interview is all I want.
And what good will that do you?
You leave that to me.
I'll tell you that presently.
Well, Mr. Carton, you know,
I don't like getting mixed up in things.
You can't trust these foreigners.
They'll cut your head off quicker than you can say
"Jack Robinson."
And how long do you think your head would stay on your shoulders if I told the Committee of Public Safety you were a paid spy of the Marquis St. Evremonde?
Shh.
Don't say that.
I won't, provided you do what I tell you now.
I'll-- I'll do as you say,
Mr. Carton, but remember now, we can't trust nobody.
Very well. Now...
Oh, Citizen Barsad.
Ah, Citizen Victor.
The, um,-- The Evremonde cell, which is it?
Third on the left.
Ten minutes, no more.
Right.
Wait.
Carton.
Of all people on Earth--
You least expected to see me.
What are you doing here?
I bring a request from Lucie.
She begs you to do exactly as I say.
Yes, but...
Carton, I don't know what you have in mind, but it's useless to attempt any form of escape.
It will involve all of you.
No, I have a plan that won't.
Now, write what I dictate.
Hurry.
What's the plan?
No, no, write, quickly.
You will remember... the words... that passed between us... on a certain occasion...
What occasion?
Never mind. Write.
I am grateful... the time has come... when I can prove them.
That I do so... is no subject... for regret or grief.
What's that?
Nothing.
Something queer, queer smelling.
No, take the pen and finish. Hurry.
I-- I'm faint.
No. Quick, write.
I said that if ever...
I could do anything... for you... or those dear to you...
Carton--
Hello, Citizen Victor.
Twenty-one, eh?
Looks like that sharp female, la guillotine, is going to have a very busy day tomorrow.
Oh, uh, tell me, what's Evremonde's number?
Evremonde is, uh, 23.
Oh, uh, 23.
Oh, uh, tell me,
Citizen Victor, what time do you take them to the big room for the last call?
Early in the morning.
Aristos have a good time in there.
Eh?
They play cards, have mock trials.
It's just like a club.
Club? That's a club that I don't wanna join.
Barsad.
Oh, it looks like my friend is ready.
Here, Citizen Victor, hop it and buy yourself a bottle of cognac.
Shh.
Shh.
I'm afraid we're not going to be able to pull this through,
Mr. Carton.
Do as you're told, and we will.
But there's got to be a number 23 here in the morning.
There will be.
Now help me.
Mr. Carton, you couldn't pay me to do what you're doing, sir.
Oh, I dare say you've got your price for even this.
Oh, no, not me,
Mr. Carton.
Now, remember, you must get him to Mr. Lorry's by 8:00.
Very good, I will.
Wait.
Now, help me to get him to his feet.
All right, call your friend.
Victor. Victor, come on, give us a hand here.
What's this?
He's fainted.
Take hold of his shoulders.
I noticed he staggered a bit as he came in.
Yes. When he saw his friend
Evremonde had drawn a prize in the lottery of St. Guillotine, it fair bowled him over.
Oh, let's get him out.
Mr. Cruncher. Mr. Cruncher.
Aye.
Come up and help carry
Mr. Darnay down. Hurry.
Hurrying, Miss Pross.
Hurrying.
Today, citizeness, your years of waiting end when Master Evremonde spits in the sack, eh?
It is not the end.
He is not the last of the Evremondes.
The wife must follow the husband.
The child must follow the father.
I'll go to them now.
They'll be frantic.
They'll denounce the justice of the republic and then--
And then:
Take this.
Have it ready for me at my usual seat by the guillotine this afternoon.
You can stop wind and fire, but not her.
And don't let anything delay you, Miss Pross.
I pray he gets my ladybird and her family out of France.
Mr. Cruncher, don't dally.
Don't beat the willing horse,
Miss Pross.
If I ever get out of this here crisis alive,
I'll make a solemn vow
I'll never stop me old woman from flopping.
She can even meditate when convenient.
I am not interested in your family situation.
Oh! I must go fetch the other two small bags from the house.
Citizen doctor.
Oh, no, you don't.
Let me pass.
Never. I know what you want.
I know what you're after.
I thank heaven
I'm put here to stop you, for stop you I will.
In the name of the republic, I--
In the name of no one, you evil woman.
You've killed many innocent people.
No doubt you'll kill many more.
But my ladybird you shall never touch again.
No? Do you know who I am?
You might, from your appearance, be the wife of Lucifer, yet you shall not get the better of me.
I'm an Englishwoman.
I'm your match.
Pig, get out of my way or I'll break you in pieces.
Break away, then.
I don't care an English tuppence for myself, and I know that the longer
I keep you here, the greater hope there is for my ladybird.
I'll give you your just dessert. God-- God save the king.
English pig.
"Citizen doctor,
Lucille Manette and child,
Sydney Carton, advocate."
Seems overcome.
"Mr. Lorry, banker."
All in order.
You may go.
Pleasant journey.
Citizen Evremonde.
Come with me.
Evremonde, 23.
Evremonde, 23.
[PRISONERS MURMURING
INDISTINCTLY]
Citizen Evremonde, do you remember me?
I was condemned the same day you were.
They accuse me of plotting.
But is it likely?
Who would think of plotting with a poor little seamstress?
I have nobody in all Paris.
No friends even.
Can you help me,
Citizen Evremonde?
Can you explain to me how the republic can profit by my--?
My death?
I don't understand.
I don't understand.
My poor child.
It isn't understanding we need now, it's courage.
Oh, you're--
Shh.
You're going to die in his place. Why?
He is my friend.
You're so brave, and--
When we go to the guillotine, will you let me hold your hand?
That might give me courage too.
Yes. I'll hold it to the last.
To the last.
"One, the Vicomte de Maillet."
"Two,
Monsieur Rochefoucault."
"Three, the Vicomte de Bovez."
But I-- I don't wanna die. Why must I die?
Come, man, assume an air.
Don't let the rabble see us like this.
You're right.
You must forgive me.
Oh, my dear, my dear.
We must be brave, as your father would have wanted.
"Thirteen, the Duchesse de Richelieu."
And forgive them their outrages, even though they fail to forgive ours.
"Twenty-two, Mademoiselle
Fontaine, the seamstress."
"Twenty-three, the Marquis St. Evremonde."
Twenty-three. Twenty-two. Hurry.
Steady.
I'm not afraid now.
But I have a sister in the South, and she knows nothing of this.
Wouldn't they let you write to her?
I never learned how to write.
Well, perhaps that's a blessing.
Isn't it better that she doesn't know?
I love her so.
Will it seem long to me to wait for her?
No.
No, there's no time there.
And no trouble.
The guillotine,
Evremonde, the guillotine.
Shh.
Don't, citizen, don't.
Why?
He's going to pay the forfeit.
In just a few minutes, it'll be paid.
Let him be at peace.
Therese!
Therese De Farge, where is she?
She's not here.
And they're up to 17.
And Evremonde will be up soon too.
His number's 23.
Yeah.
She never missed before.
She'll not miss it.
This is her day.
Therese!
I dropped a stitch.
Cursed aristocrats.
Keep your eyes on me.
Mind nothing else.
I can bear it, so long as I am near you.
But when I go, will they be quick?
They will be.
You're not afraid.
The others are only pretending, but you...
It's almost as if you welcomed it.
Perhaps I do.
Perhaps in death I receive something I never had in life.
I hold a sanctuary in the hearts of those I care for.
Twenty-two.
Goodbye.
God bless you.
Twenty-three.
It's a far, far better thing I do
than I have ever done.
It's a far, far better rest I go to
than I have ever known.
Oh, that's the cocktail bar, huh? What's in there?
It's a private dining room.
From now on, it's the gambling room.
- Make a note of that, Charlie.
- Right.
Take him out for a walk.
It's too stuffy in here.
That, it's crummy. Change it.
But, Mr. Vanning, it's French.
I had it specially designed.
It's still crummy. None of the classy spots use that kind of stuff anymore.
I want the kind that sticks up in the ceiling.
- Indirect lighting.
- That's what I want.
- Hello, Gabby. Still around?
- Yeah.
Emmy Lou is the name, Mr. Vanning.
All right, now. This is it.
I'm taking over this joint.
From now on, you're working for me, understand?
Most of you have been around long enough to know how I operate.
If you don't, read the papers and find out.
Up to now, this night club racket's been run on a penny-ante basis.
That's out.
From now on, I'm organizing it.
When I organize anything, I make it pay big money, or else.
Now, this town is full of big shots from the sticks.
They keep pouring in by the carload, looking for one thing:
The kind of time they can go home and brag about.
And torch songs with soft lights aren't going to satisfy them.
We know the action they want, and we are going to give it...
...from tiddlywinks to roulette.
But they're going to pay for it plenty, understand?
In other words, a clip joint.
Yeah, and run on a high-class basis.
Your job is to soften them up so they can be taken.
There's only one way to work on chumps: Our way.
With no holds barred.
High-class?
- You don't like it, huh?
- It all depends.
How much is there in it for us?
About 50 times what you're getting now. But you don't get it for nothing.
Every week, you're going to kick back part of what you make to me.
That goes for protection, hush money, lawyer's fee, bail bonds, anything else...
...to square the rap in case the law steps in.
That's one thing you won't have to worry about.
Anybody that sticks with me gets taken care of.
Maybe you like this setup, maybe you don't...
...but you're going to take it.
I got every nightclub in town...
...and every girl working in every nightclub, sewed up.
You're going to work the way I tell you, or you don't work at all.
You got that straight?
All right, the place will be closed until we get it fixed like I want it.
And cut a peephole in the door. The chumps go for that "hard to get in" angle.
Come on, let's get out of here.
- Wait till I get my pay.
- Hurry up. We'll be outside.
Hey, you. Yeah, you.
Kind of old ain't you?
I need young dames here, the kind men go for in a hurry.
- But I've been here a long time...
- That's the trouble.
You won't do. You're through.
You said you took care of people who were loyal to you.
- She never worked for me.
- But she has for Beler.
And she's always been on the level.
How do you know what she can do?
Why kick her out just because you're taking over?
Sure, she's okay, Vanning.
Why don't you give her a break and let her prove it?
- You know, she can't wreck the place.
- Yeah?
- Okay.
- Thanks, Mr. Vanning.
- Pretty smart girl, aren't you?
- I get along.
How about coming up to my place for a drink? I'd like to know you better.
- No, thanks.
- Why not?
Well, you've told me I was working for you. So I work for you.
That's as far as it goes.
Anyway, I'm sort of afraid of your social set.
- Afraid?
- Yes.
I might get to learn too much about you, like Audrey Fleming did.
Remember?
If I'd wanted to end up in the river...
...I'd have taken a jump off
Brooklyn Bridge five years ago.
- You're not afraid to talk anyway.
- We're among friends.
And I think we'll get along a lot better if we understand each other.
- I think I'll be a big help to your business.
- Maybe you will at that.
Good night.
- Smart girl.
- Maybe too smart.
- Thanks, Mary. You were swell.
- Forget it, Estelle.
- Good night, Mr. Vanning.
- Good night.
- What's her name?
- Emmy Lou.
Make a note of it.
Here you are, girls.
Wait a minute, let's walk. We'll need some fresh air after that one.
That sign, what's it mean?
- Well, come on. What does it mean?
- Intimate.
- What does that mean?
- You know, intimate.
Personal. Get together. Like this:
Oh, well, why don't it say what it means?
- Change it.
- To what?
- What was that you said?
- Intimate.
- Intimate. Make a note of it.
- Right.
Good morning.
I don't really look old, do I?
What does he expect a girl to look like at 6 in the morning...
...after dragging heavyweight salesmen around a dance floor?
Like a debutante?
If he saw me when I'd come to work and my makeup was fresh...
Oh, let's skip it, Estelle, and go to bed. We're all fagged out.
Well, let him fire me. What do I care?
I don't want any part of his clip joints anyway.
And if you do, you're crazy.
He might as well put a gun in our hands and send us out on stickups.
Well, what are you going to do?
You heard what he said.
It's Vanning or nothing.
Well, this isn't the only way to make a living.
- Do you know a better one?
- Well, I can always go back into vaudeville.
Oh, stop kidding yourself,
Estelle. Your dancing days are over.
You'd need counterweights to keep your arches from falling.
Well, then I'll get a job in a factory, behind a counter, anyplace.
- At 12 and a half a week?
- That's enough for me.
For cigarettes.
We've all tried this 12 and a half a week stuff. It's no good.
Living in furnished rooms, walking to work.
Going hungry a couple of days a week...
...so you can have some clothes to put on your back.
I've had enough of that for the rest of my life.
And so have you.
Well, of course she has.
She's just burned up because
Johnny said she was getting old.
Aren't you, honey?
You're a sweet little hyena, aren't you?
Well, it's true, isn't it?
You know, working for Vanning isn't gonna be any bed of roses.
- And you don't have to rub it in.
- You're gonna work for him.
But I'm not getting into his trap.
And I'm not taking any chances of getting a slap in the face with a spade either.
You know, we're letting ourselves in for enough as it is.
Some will wind up in the short end, but not me, baby.
I know all the angles, and I think I'm smart enough to keep one step ahead of them...
...till I get enough to pack it all in and live on easy street the rest of my life.
- I know how to beat this racket.
- Yeah? How?
That's what I've been trying to find out for years.
- Good evening, gentlemen.
- Hey.
- Oh, look at that.
- Keep the change.
This way, please. Where are they from?
Picked them up at Waldorf-Ritz, metal industries banquet.
It's locked. Hey, captain, commodore, come on.
Just a second, gentlemen.
From the Waldorf-Ritz.
McGrew sent them.
Say, are we having fun?
- Good evening.
- How do you do?
- How many?
- Four, please.
Right this way, please.
Are there going to be any more in your party?
I don't know.
Are there?
Carrie.
Florrie, sit here.
- Sit right down, honey.
- Oh, no, no. I saw her first.
All right, I've got my gal right here.
Gabby, go to work on them.
Well, how do you want it, honey?
Soft and smooth, or loud and hard?
Soft and smooth. Only don't put them to sleep just yet.
What is your party drinking?
- Why, what have you been drinking?
- Oh, champagne.
Fine. We don't wanna change your diet.
- Champagne for everybody.
- Everybody, champagne. Gallons of it.
Are you in the mood for music?
- I'll say I am, baby.
- All right. Hey, Gus.
- They're all set.
- Who ordered?
The young fellow with Mary. Champagne.
- Well, tell Mary the dice table for him.
- Okay.
Come on. Come on over here and sit up here, baby.
Here's how.
Thanks, sugar.
Snake eyes.
- Well, honey, I guess this isn't our night.
- Oh, keep on trying, you'll get hot.
Not with three pair of snake eyes in a row.
- How much am I in for?
- Eighteen hundred dollars.
- Is that all?
- Yes.
Would you mind taking my check? I don't like leaving myself without any cash.
- Glad to accommodate you.
- That's what I call service.
I believe you ordered for the party.
You might as well add this to it.
- That's a lot of party. Where are the others?
- They got a bit tight and left with the girls.
- Thanks.
- Come on, honey, let's go.
- Cab.
- Yes, sir.
Good night.
Need a cab?
Tail that cab.
- Boy, they sure took me to the cleaners.
- You had a good time, didn't you?
Never had a better time in my life.
I'd like to do it all over again.
- Well, I guess you can afford it.
- Afford it?
- What's so funny?
- You were thinking I can afford it.
Listen, sister, I don't make that much money in a year...
...let alone spend it.
You mean that you haven't got the money to pay off?
No, not a red cent. I was just putting on an act.
Boy, I'd like to see the look on their faces when they try to cash that check.
- Will that be funny.
- Yeah, like a funeral. Yours.
And that's what you're going to have if they don't get their money.
What are you talking about?
You're messing with the toughest gang in town. They'd cut your throat for a dime.
So you can imagine what they're going to do to you for that kind of money.
Say, are you kidding me?
Well, if you don't believe me, stick around and find out.
Well, what am I gonna do?
You got enough money to pay your hotel bill?
I paid that in advance.
Got my railroad ticket too.
Well, use it. Check out of that hotel...
...and grab the first train home before it's too late.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Remember what I told you.
- Oh, I will.
- Mary.
- Yeah?
Mary, I... I haven't even got enough to pay for the cab.
- Here.
- Thanks. I'll send it to you.
- What's your address.
- Forget it.
No, no, no. Please, write it down here.
All right.
Oh, gee, you're swell.
I don't know why. A sap like you deserves to be taken.
I guess you must bring out the mother instinct in me.
Now, go on, get in. Hurry.
- Good night, chump.
- Good night.
- Be careful.
- All right.
Take him to Waldorf-Ritz and step on it.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Hello, McGrew.
- Hiya.
Mind if we park here for a while?
Gotta keep an eye on one of those guys you sent till we can get his check through.
- How much did you take him for?
- Plenty.
Yes, sir, 319? Yes, sir. Right away.
He's checking out.
Pennsylvania Station.
What a night.
Oh, does it feel good to stand up and stretch.
Good morning.
- What's good about it?
- You all look as if you had hangovers.
No, stomachaches. I never ate so much chop suey in my life.
Me neither. One more dish and I'd have put my hair in a braid and opened a laundry.
Well, I like chop suey.
- You like anything.
- What happened?
Well, our boyfriends' idea of a swell evening...
...was to take us from one chop suey joint to another.
Did we have fun.
The only laugh I got was when the screwball I was with...
...tried to show off and darn near choked to death on a chopstick.
- How did you do, Mary?
- Oh, all right.
- Did they take that chump for much?
- Well, I... I don't know.
- Where did you go after you left the club?
- Home.
Gee, it must be swell to get some sleep.
And where did you disappear to last night that makes you so smug?
I spent a very charming evening with Mr. Vanning.
Emmy Lou.
- You're a fool.
- Don't kid yourself.
Girls, good morning.
Don't you believe in knocking twice?
- Don't you believe in paying once?
- No.
So we're even. How about it, girls?
According to my book, you owe me for enough dresses to start a new business.
Now, it's gonna come to a showdown.
Either you're gonna pay me or you ain't, one or the other.
Louie, I'm afraid it's gonna have to be the other.
Give us a break, will you, Louie?
You know us. We're good for it.
Listen, girls, if it was up to me, honest, I'd do it in a minute. Why not?
I like you, you like me.
But what am I gonna do?
That guy Vanning and his bunch are on my neck every minute of the day.
Collect, collect, collect.
- Vanning? What's he got to do with it?
- Everything. He's taken this over too.
Yeah, it's the truth.
All my life I've been in business for myself.
If I lost all the money I made, at least it was mine.
But now I don't even get that satisfaction.
Everything is his. Just like with you girls. Nice, huh?
You know, pretty soon that guy is gonna charge us for breathing.
- Listen, if you'll promise to pay a little...
- Yeah?
- I'll show you some new stuff I got.
I positively guarantee you that it was stolen from the best shop in town.
But you gotta promise.
- Sure.
- Oh, we promise.
- Sure.
- I'll bet we're gonna love it.
- Oh, it's heavy.
- I want the white one!
- Hey, take it easy, take it easy.
- You can't do that, that's mine.
Oh, look at this. Isn't this...?
Yes, sir.
Pick me up in about a half-hour?
- So long. Bye.
- So long.
- Emmy Lou, look.
- Isn't it adorable?
That's one of the most beautiful pieces of merchandise I ever seen.
- Come in.
- Come in.
- Betty.
- Hello, Mary.
Gee, I'm glad to see you.
Girls, this is my kid sister, Betty, that I've told you so much about.
How do you do?
- Oh, Betty, this is Louie, our designer.
- Designer?
Yes. You see, our store is giving a fashion show...
...and they sent him up with some models that we are to wear.
And, well, we were rehearsing.
That is, Emmy Lou was.
Weren't you, Emmy Lou?
Oh, yeah, yeah. Sure.
- You have to rehearse for a fashion show?
- Sure. Just like being an actress.
And you have to keep on rehearsing, don't you girls?
Sure, sure.
Louie, we'll see you back at the show room.
Show room?
So this is the sister you're always talking about, huh, Mary? Nice-looking girl.
Nice-looking coat too.
It looks like... Sure, I remember.
I sold it to you a year ago.
- I said goodbye, Louie.
- Yes, goodbye, Louie.
- What about the money?
- You can send us the check.
Send you a check? Are you crazy, or am I?
- Come on, Louie.
- Now, wait a minute.
Cut it out, will you? What is this?
Halloween. We're putting on a masquerade.
Can't you get it through your skull...
...that she doesn't want her sister to know what she's doing?
- I get it now.
- I thought you'd get it sooner or later.
Oh, come on, will you, quit kidding.
You've never seen so much excitement in your life.
For weeks the whole school has talked about nothing else but this football game.
See, the boys who we're playing come from college right near us.
We know most of them all, and...
And, you know...
- Sweet.
- Like sugar.
So we decided to come and see it.
It didn't cost much, Mary.
Besides, I was dying to see you.
Oh, I'm glad you came, darling.
Gee, it must be fun going to school.
Oh, it's not exciting, if that's what you mean.
Mostly going to classes and studying.
Of course, once in a while we have dances and parties, and that's about all.
I don't think you'd like it.
It sounds easier than standing on your feet all night...
- How long are you going to stay, Betty?
- Just for the day.
We're going to the game, then going right back.
You're coming with us, aren't you?
No. No, you go with your friends.
I... I think I'll just stay home and rest.
You're tired, aren't you?
You all look so tired.
You must work awfully hard in that dress shop.
Oh, no, no. It just happened that this week was a very busy week.
Yeah, sugar. They practically rushed us right off our feet.
I wish there was something I could do, Mary.
- You keep right on going to school.
- I know.
But it sort of makes me feel so helpless.
I go to school and a have good time...
...and you have to work so awfully hard to keep me there.
I'll pay you back for it someday, Mary.
You'll pay me back every time I look at you.
That must be my friends. I'll answer it.
- Which one of you is Mary Dwight?
- I am.
Know a fella named Ralph Krawford?
Ralph Krawford?
Yes, I was out with him last night.
Did you ever see this before?
Sure. Sure, I gave it to him.
- What about it?
- Nothing.
Only it was in his pocket when we found him. Murdered.
- Murdered?
- We found him in an alley this morning.
What's that got to do with me?
You'll find out when we get down to headquarters. Get dressed.
No, I don't want to go. Tell me what I'm being arrested for.
Well, if you must know, sister, we're holding you on suspicion of murder.
The rest of you get your clothes on.
Well, you don't think it took all of us to kill him.
You'll get a chance to answer that. Get going.
And these four men approached you and asked you to recommend a nightclub?
Yes, sir.
- Why did you send them to Club Intimate?
- No particular reason.
It was just the first place that popped into my head.
Because you were paid so much a head by
Vanning for steering suckers in there?
Vanning? Who's Vanning?
Never heard of him.
Never heard of two years in jail for perjury either?
I make a living out of tips.
If a guest in the hotel asks me a question, it's part of my job to answer it.
What he does and where he goes after that is none of my business.
That's all. Thanks.
Well, I guess that's that.
He was lying, and so were the rest of them.
They all know how and why that man was murdered and who was back of it.
Just as you and I do.
It's marvelous, isn't it?
One man, Johnny Vanning, completely terrorizes the city.
Commits every crime from murder to mayhem.
We all know it, yet we can't do a thing about it.
Look, son.
My files are bulging with quashed indictments...
...hung juries, verdicts of "not guilty. "
So long as Vanning is able to buy politicians and hire unscrupulous lawyers...
...who take advantage of every technicality of the law...
...who coach and buy perjured testimony...
...and so long as Vanning is able to continue intimidating witnesses, it's futile.
Well, how long is it gonna keep on being futile?
I don't know.
We've got to wait for Vanning to make that one false move.
Yeah, well, I don't like waiting.
- Do you wanna take the case into court?
- Sure.
- With those witnesses?
- Sure, why not?
If Vanning can get away with intimidation, why can't I?
You're a young man, Dave.
At this stage of your career, a fiasco isn't going to help you much.
- Yeah, well, I'll take that chance.
- All right.
From now on, it's your case. Go to it.
- Thanks.
- Good luck.
- Did you pick up those girls?
- They're in with the others.
- Would you mind stepping into my office?
- Not at all.
You too, Casey.
Right this way, gentleman.
Step right over here.
- Oh, Casey, will you close that blind?
- Yes, sir.
Ferguson, have all those girls line up facing this way.
Stand up, please.
Those the girls you were with last night?
You've got nothing to be afraid of. They can't see you.
- Were those the girls?
- Yes, sir. Yeah.
- All except that one on the end.
- Which one?
The one with the leather coat.
The girl with the leather coat, step forward.
- Sure you didn't see her around the club?
- Yes, sir.
All right, which one was with Krawford?
- The one on the end, the blond.
- That's Mary Dwight.
Ferguson, bring Mary Dwight into my office right away.
All right, thank you. That's all.
- Mary Dwight?
- That's right.
Sit down.
Go ahead, sit down.
All right.
- You work at the Club Intimate?
- Are you telling me or asking me?
- Those other girls, they work there too?
- You know everything.
That little girl with the leather coat, what does she do?
She's got nothing to do with this.
- We'll find out about that later.
- No, we'll find out about that right now.
That kid's my sister.
And she was down here visiting me...
...when those gorillas of yours blew in and pulled us all in.
And I'll tell you something else. If you get her mixed up in this, I'll...
I'm not. If she had nothing to do with it, I'll let her go.
Just as I'll let you go, if you had nothing to do with it.
Now, last night about 10:00 four men came into the club.
And they sat down with you girls.
You had some drinks and you danced.
There isn't any law against that, is there?
One of those men was Ralph
Krawford. He was with you.
The other four left about
1:00. You and he stayed.
He lost a lot of money gambling.
Then you left together in a cab.
- Where'd you go?
- Home.
- What'd you do when you got there?
- Nothing.
I got out, and he went off in the cab.
Where?
I don't know.
The cab driver testified minutes ago...
...that you told him to take
Krawford to the Waldorf-Ritz Hotel.
How do you account for that?
- Supposing I did?
- Then you did know where he was going?
Well, I knew where he was starting for, but I didn't know where he'd wind up.
You didn't see him between the time he checked out of his hotel...
...and the time we found him murdered?
- No.
Can you prove you didn't?
Can you prove I did?
- You're a pretty smart girl.
- So they tell me.
Much too smart to be protecting a murderer like Vanning.
I'm not protecting anybody but myself.
Now, Mary, we're trying to help you.
- I'm doing all right.
- For how long?
Until Vanning gets as much as he can and throws you in the ashcan...
...just like he's done with everything he's ever laid his hands on.
And we're trying to put a stop to that, help people like you.
But there's nothing we can do unless you're willing to help yourself.
Now, why don't you give us a break.
What kind of a break have you ever given us...
...outside of kicking us around every chance you could get?
There's only one kind of a break we want from you, and that's to leave us alone.
And let us make a living in our own way.
Or is that asking too much?
Anything else you wanna know?
How do you like the inside of a jail?
- Me?
- Yes, you.
Because that's where you're going.
Maybe you don't know it, but there's a law in this state...
...that makes an accessory to a murder equally as guilty as the murderer himself.
Now, unless you tell me exactly what happened and who did it...
...I'm going to indict you for murder.
Nice. Just when I got everything running fine.
- It'll blow over.
- Yeah.
In the meantime, every one of my joints gets a bad reputation.
What do you suppose people thought they were before this happened?
- Ice-cream parlors?
- Never mind that.
I want it stopped.
What kind of a guy is this Graham?
Young, ambitious.
What's his price?
Did you ever hear the story about the virtuous young man?
Someday you're going to give me one of those answers...
...and I'm going to bust you right in the nose.
Tell it to me in English.
He can't be bought.
Is that plain enough?
Yeah.
Too plain.
Anybody that wouldn't take dough is crazy. Crazy men are dangerous.
A guy like that is liable to get too big and really put the clamps down.
And where will we be?
Oh, I've got something worked out that will take care of that.
- Is it cute?
- Everything I do is cute.
When I get through with him...
...he'll be lucky to be able get a job as a second assistant to a notary public.
Swell.
- Did you spring the girl yet?
- No.
What are you waiting for?
When I promise to get my girls out in case they get jammed up, I mean it.
- Get her out.
- She stays in jail.
Listen, Gordon.
You're doing all right as my lawyer.
But I don't like it when you start trying to be my boss.
Get that girl out before she starts squawking.
- That's just what I want her to do.
- What?
Only she's going to squawk the way I tell her to.
How do you do, Miss
Dwight? Sorry I was delayed.
I got here as soon as I could.
Now, before we accept this case, there are several things I'd like to discuss with you.
- Who sent you?
- Vanning, and keep it under your hat.
It's about time.
- Well?
- Sit down.
Look, that's all I've been doing for the past two days...
...is standing up and sitting down.
I don't need a lawyer to tell me that.
- When do I get out of here?
- You don't.
- Oh, I see. A little conniving.
- Yeah, that's right.
I go to bat for Vanning...
...and I get paid off by taking the rap for him.
Listen, jurisprudence, I pay Vanning good money to settle little things like this...
...and he's going to get me out of here.
Now, listen, you know Vanning takes care of all the people that play ball with him.
- You've got to stay here and help him.
- Help him?
What is this, a charity affair?
He's gonna help me, and do it fast.
Now, if he doesn't get me out of here by tonight, I am going to...
Do nothing.
Vanning was telling me that you said something about a girl...
...that was found in the river by the name of Audrey Fleming.
Now, you don't wanna be found in that spot, do you?
You sit down and listen to what I got to say.
What did you want to see me about?
- How long are you going to keep me here?
- That entirely depends on you.
You wouldn't do this to me if I were somebody important, would you?
No.
You'd be afraid. Somebody higher up might find out.
You might lose your job.
But with me, you can get tough.
People like us, we don't count.
We're nobodies. Setups to be kicked about by whoever feels like it.
Well, I won't stand for it.
- Either you let me out of here, or I'll...
- Or what?
Coming in here like this isn't gonna help you at all.
There's only one way for you to get out.
Tell me what happened the night Krawford was murdered.
- I can't.
- Why not?
- I'm afraid.
- Of Vanning?
Yes. He'll kill me.
- He did have something to do with this?
- No, he didn't. He was...
Oh, please don't ask me to talk. He'll kill me.
Help me to prove he's responsible, I'll put him where he won't kill anybody.
You don't know what he's like. He stops at nothing.
People disappear and are never heard of again.
I don't want that to happen to me. I'm young and I wanna live.
I don't wanna die.
All right. Come on, now.
Pull yourself together.
Here, use this.
Thanks.
- Pretty tough going for you girls, isn't it?
- Yeah.
Sometimes it's too tough.
There's no use crying about it.
That's the way it is.
That's the way it's gotta be.
No, it doesn't.
You're not the only one that was born with two strikes against him.
I probably got kicked around just as much as you did.
I didn't like it any better than you do.
The only difference between us...
...is that, well, I did something about it. You won't.
Now, Mary, if you'll help me to put
Vanning and his crowd where they belong...
...you'll not only be helping yourself...
...but you'll be helping thousands of other girls just like you.
If you won't...
...well, then you'll just keep on getting in deeper and deeper until...
Well, I... I guess you know the rest of the story just as well as I do.
- Now, you see that, don't you?
- Yeah, I see.
Well, now, why won't you tell me what you know?
Well, what have you got to lose?
Nothing. Not a thing.
Then you'll talk?
- Why not?
- Good girl.
Oh, Smith, come in here and bring your book.
And now, Miss Dwight...
...you've testified that when you arrived at the Waldorf-Ritz Hotel...
...you saw the deceased being dragged into a taxicab by two of the defendants.
- Is that right?
- Yes, sir.
Can you identify these men?
Yes, sir.
Will the defendants please rise?
Will you indicate the men you saw that night?
Go ahead, Miss Dwight, you have nothing to be afraid of.
Which are the men?
Those men standing there behind Mr. Vanning.
And you positively identify
William Borno and James Meller...
...as the two men you saw drag the deceased, Ralph Krawford, into the taxicab?
Yes, sir.
- Have you ever seen these men before?
- Oh, sure.
They're a couple of
Vanning's strong-arm men.
They work as bouncers at the club.
Thank you, Miss Dwight.
Your witness.
- You say your name is Mary Dwight?
- Yes, sir.
Is that your true name?
Answer the question.
- Is that your true name?
- No, sir.
- Then what is it?
- Mary Strauber.
Why did you have to change it, Miss Strauber?
- For professional reasons.
- What is your profession?
I object. That's immaterial.
I'm merely trying to establish the character of this witness.
- Overruled. Proceed.
- I repeat the question.
- What is your profession, Miss Strauber?
- I'm a hostess in a nightclub.
Now, will you please explain to the jury just what your duties as hostess are?
Well, we have to entertain all the men that come into the club alone.
And just how do you entertain these men?
I object. That's a deliberate attempt to degrade the witness.
Overruled. I believe it's material.
And now, just how do you entertain these men?
Well, we dance with them and get them to buy us drinks.
Is that all?
Well, we're nice and pleasant to them and see that they have a good time.
In other words, you've got to be nice and pleasant to men you don't know...
...who ordinarily you'd have nothing to do with, isn't that right?
- Yes, sir.
- Now, Miss Strauber...
...isn't it true that a week previous to the night in question...
...you were threatened with dismissal by Mr. Vanning...
...for exceeding your duties as hostess?
Objection, Your Honor. It's irrelevant and immaterial.
I believe it both relevant and material to inquire into the motives of this witness.
Overruled.
I ask you again, is it true that in spite of repeated warnings by Mr. Vanning...
...that he would not tolerate such conduct in any establishment of his...
...you persisted in entertaining the men outside the club?
- Yes, but I...
- That's all, Miss Strauber.
Thank you.
The people rest.
The defense calls John Truble.
Will you please take the witness stand, Mr. Truble?
Put up your right hand.
Do you swear to tell the truth and nothing but the truth?
- I do.
- What's your name?
- John Truble.
- Please be seated.
Mr. Truble, as sheriff for Maco County...
...do you recall arresting two men named William Borno and James Meller...
...for drunken driving?
- Yes, sir.
What disposition was made of that charge?
They both pleaded guilty, so they got a $50 fine and 10 days in jail apiece.
Please look around this courtroom and see if you see...
...either William Borno or James Meller or both.
There's the two of them, sitting there behind the table.
Will you two men rise, please?
- You mean these two men?
- That's right. That's them.
May the record show that the witness has indicated the defendants Borno and Meller.
Now, Mr. Truble...
...you positively identify them as the two men remanded into your custody...
...at Maco County Jail from
October 4th to October 14th?
Yes, sir.
And you're certain that you didn't permit them to leave the jail...
...so that they could be seen dragging the deceased into a taxicab...
...on the night of October 9th?
No, sir. I'm very strict about that.
Your Honor, I wish to offer into evidence...
...these duly attested records of the arrest, conviction and imprisonment...
...of the defendants, William
Borno and James Meller...
...on the charges and for the period just stated by the witness.
They may be so received.
And so, ladies and gentlemen of the jury...
...you can understand why the district attorney...
...floundering in his desperate attempts to prosecute my client...
...has the effrontery to bring into this court such an obviously trumped-up charge.
And as if this were not enough...
...he expects an intelligent jury to convict the defendants for murder...
...on the testimony of a woman he tells you is an innocent victim of circumstances...
...but who, by her own admission, is not only unreliable, unscrupulous...
...and unfit to be heard and believed in any court of justice...
...but is definitely objectionable...
...in the eyes of all decent and upright men and women.
"We, the jury in the above entitled action, find the defendants, and each of them...
...not guilty. "
The clerk will record the verdict as read.
The jury is excused and the defendants are discharged.
Boy, I've been in some rotten ones, but this smells to high heaven.
Nice going, kid.
Thanks.
Yes, it's reached my nose by now.
Oh, just a minute.
You know, for a little while, you had me believing in you.
I thought maybe you were different.
My mistake. Thanks for the ride.
You know, if I weren't in such a hurry, I'd break right down and cry.
So long, chump. I'll be seeing you.
I wish it was all over.
It's getting on my nerves.
Yes, and your talking about it is getting on mine.
- Well, what happened? Where's the kid?
- Inside.
- Vanning won, didn't he?
- Yeah, Vanning won.
- How's she taking it?
- Pretty tough.
If you want me to, I'll talk to her first, Mary.
No, thanks, Estelle.
Had to happen sooner or later. So I...
Suppose I might just as well go in and face it now.
Hello, Betty.
Betty?
You know, this isn't gonna get us anywhere, darling.
Why didn't you tell me?
Why did you let me believe that...?
Well, I...
I just couldn't.
I guess I didn't ever want you to find out.
I wish now I had.
I've hurt you, haven't I, darling?
Betty...
...you're not going to let this make any difference between us, are you?
Are you?
You can't.
You'll see.
You'll forget all about it.
And in a couple of weeks, you'll be going back to school.
Mary...
...I'm not going back to school.
Not going back to school?
Why?
Oh, I don't know.
I just don't like school anymore, that's all.
I've been thinking of leaving for a long time.
- That's not the reason.
- Yes, it is.
Betty, I want you to tell me the truth.
I wanna know why you're not going back to school.
All right, I'll tell you.
I can't.
Don't you think my friends have read the papers?
Don't you think they've seen your picture and mine plastered all over the front pages?
I couldn't go back and face them now.
I'd be too ashamed.
- Ashamed of what?
- Of you.
Mary?
Mary, please, I didn't mean it.
Oh, please, don't. I didn't...
I know you didn't, Betty.
That's all right. Let's forget all about it.
Pretend you never said it.
Hello?
- Oh, it's you. You scared me.
- I'm sorry.
Don't you ever get tired sitting around in the dark all by yourself?
- I like it.
- I like it too, but not by myself.
I'm going to a party, gonna get dressed up.
Wanna be a sweet gal and give me a hand?
- Love to.
- It's gonna be a great big party.
I'm gonna wear the prettiest dress I got. Everybody in town is gonna be there.
Which one do you want?
The silver one with the little black jacket. It's hanging toward the back.
Oh, this one.
- Why, Emmy Lou, it's beautiful.
- Well, all my dresses are beautiful.
They gotta be in this racket.
There's nothing like clothes, honey.
That's the sugar that makes the flies come around.
I'll bet it'd look nice on you too.
I once had a dress like this.
Of course, it wasn't nearly so pretty, but it was silver.
I wore it to the junior prom.
Gee, I had fun that night.
- Lots of boyfriends, huh?
- I never missed a dance.
You miss dancing, don't you?
Kind of.
How'd you like to go the party with me tonight?
- Party?
- Sure.
Vanning's throwing it. One of the classiest affairs in town.
You'd have the time of your life. Come on, what do you say?
- Why, I'd love to, but...
- But what?
It's all right for an old maid to sit around...
...but a swell-looking kid like you ought to go out and enjoy life.
Get some fun out of it.
You could use a little fun, couldn't you?
- Yes, I...
- That settles it. You're going in this dress.
- But, Emmy Lou, I...
- Come on, get out of these pajamas.
And you're gonna have a marvelous time. You're gonna meet loads of people.
All right, but, Emmy Lou...
- Swell, isn't it?
- Marvelous.
Very lovely, Johnny. Where have you been keeping them?
- The one in silver?
- Like it?
- What do you think?
- It's yours.
- Who's the kid?
- Friend of mine.
Is she all right?
Think I would have brought her along if she wasn't?
Okay.
Particular friend of mine I want her to meet, understand?
- Sure, Johnny. Where is he?
- Over at the bar.
Big fellow by the end.
- What's his name?
- Crandall. Bob Crandall.
Okay, Johnny.
Come on, sugar.
Well, if it isn't Bob Crandall.
- Well, where you been keeping yourself?
- Well, hello. How are you?
I want you to meet Betty
Strauber. Bob Crandall.
I've known him for years.
- How do you do?
- Will you have some champagne?
- Champagne?
- Oh, why, sure, we'd love it.
- More champagne.
- Yes, sir.
Would you excuse me? There's somebody I've gotta see.
I'll pick you up later.
- Won't you sit down?
- Thank you.
I'm way ahead of you. Do you think you can catch up?
- I'll try.
- Great. Here's to a large evening.
Tickled? Good.
- How you doing, sugar?
- Swell.
Eighty cents.
Wait a minute. I ain't got no change for no $ 100 bill.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Thank you.
- Oh, hello.
- Hello.
- Where were you?
- At a party.
- Who took you?
- Emmy Lou.
I'm sorry for having come in so late, but we were having a marvelous time, and I...
Where did you get that money?
- Oh, this. Mr. Crandall gave it to me.
- Why?
I told him I had to leave, and he gave it to me for taxi fare.
I guess he must've been drunk.
- I suppose you're going to see him again?
- Yes, tomorrow for lunch.
You little fool.
- Take it easy.
- Shut up!
- Mary, what's wrong?
- Get upstairs.
- What have I done?
- I said, get upstairs.
- The kid didn't know.
- I told you to shut up. This is my affair.
I wanna know why it's all right for you to go to Vanning's parties and not for me.
So that's where you were.
Betty. Betty, you listen to me.
If you wanna go to a party again, you get advice from me.
Do you hear?
But you still haven't answered my question.
Well, you're different, that's why.
- Maybe I'm not. Maybe I'm just like you are.
- Betty.
Think I'm gonna stay cooped up forever because you're afraid...
...I'm liable to do the same things you do?
- Oh, Betty, be quiet.
- No, I won't. It's the truth.
You're afraid. Well,
I'm not. Not anymore.
I've got the whole thing figured out.
Betty. Betty, listen to me. You know, I've done an awful lot for you.
All you've ever done for me is mess up my life.
Fixed it so the things that I wanted to have, I can't have anymore.
All right. If I can't live one way, I can live another.
- Why not? I'm young and pretty and...
- And dumb.
But you're smart.
You can teach me the rest.
All right.
If that's the way you feel, you can go anywhere you want to from now on.
You can even go back to Vanning's party.
That's exactly what I'm going to do.
Hello, beautiful. You back again?
Hello. I'm looking for someone.
You can stop looking right now, because you've found him.
That's something to celebrate about, isn't it? Or is it?
- Yes, it is.
- You look sad, beautiful.
I don't wanna see you look sad.
- What you need is champagne, lots of it.
- Maybe I do.
Not there, out on the terrace. All by ourselves.
That something to cheer your little heart up?
The champagne, the terrace and me. That worth a smile?
Come on, give it to me.
That's better.
Well, now for a little champagne.
Well, here we are.
Big, isn't it?
Yeah, but it's not so big you can't have anything that's in it.
It's too big. It makes you feel lonely and scared.
Well, if that don't suit you, there's the moon.
You can ask me for that.
Or the stars.
But you don't need them.
They're right in your eyes.
- You say pretty things.
- Pretty things, pretty people.
I say them and give them.
- Please don't.
- You're a funny kid.
Don't, please. No, please don't.
No, you don't. Come on, honey. Don't act that way. Give me a little kiss.
That's right, beautiful. Go right up to the sky. I'll meet you there.
- Emmy Lou.
- Why, Betty, what's the matter?
Take me home. Please take me home.
What's eating her? She stewed or something?
Come on, kid, stop putting on an act.
- Oh, Johnny, wait...
- Shut up. You heard me, come on.
- Let go of me!
- Johnny.
- You're going to go nice?
- No, I won't do it!
Looks bad. She ain't breathing so good. Shall I get an ambulance?
And have her talk? Don't be a sucker.
Where's Betty?
Betty?
You heard me. Where's Betty?
- Well, didn't she come home?
- She did, but she went back.
She didn't come back to the party. At least, I didn't see her.
- Emmy Lou, you're lying.
- Well, why should I lie to you?
- Where did she go?
- I tell you, I didn't see her.
- I could kill you.
- You leave me alone.
- Who told you to take her?
- I didn't take her, she wanted to go.
She's not the kind of kid to get mixed up in a party like that.
- Why didn't you look after her?
- Why didn't you look after her yourself?
She was your sister, not mine.
If anything happens to her...
Nothing's happened to her.
- How do you know?
- I just know, I'm telling you.
I just know.
- Where you going?
- I've got to find her.
Stick around a while. She might show up.
Oh, I can't wait, Gabby.
- Where's my sister?
- Your what?
- My sister.
- How should I know?
I never saw your sister in my life.
You're lying. She was here last night at your party.
She came with Emmy Lou.
- Oh, was that your sister?
- Yes.
Nice-looking kid.
Yeah, she was here, but went home about 2:00.
- Ain't that right, Charlie?
- Yeah.
- You're lying. Both of you.
- Now, take it easy.
You're lying and you know it.
Betty came back here again, and I can prove it.
- Yeah, by who?
- Never mind that.
- Where is she? What happened to her?
- What's the matter with you, Mary?
Don't you think I'd tell you if I knew?
- Why should I wanna hold out on you?
- I don't know.
But I'm gonna find out.
All right, I tried to be nice to you.
- Now get out, and fast.
- You don't scare me.
Oh, hot-headed, eh? Just like...
- Like who?
- Like me.
I'm the same way.
Now, go home and cool off.
I'll send some of the boys out.
Maybe they'll help you find her.
Listen, Vanning, all I know is that kid sister of mine came back here again last night...
...and nobody's seen her since.
And get this straight:
If I find out that you or anybody else has laid a finger on her...
You'll what?
I'll get you.
Even if I have to crawl back from my grave to do it.
Her sister, eh? That's bad.
- Who do you think tipped her?
- Who do you think?
Emmy Lou. Go over there and grab that ditzy blond before she shoots off her face.
I know she went back to the party, and I can prove it.
Emmy Lou is just covering up for Vanning.
He just tried to pawn the same story off on me.
And you know that Vanning doesn't start ducking around corners for nothing.
That's what's driving me crazy.
- And that's why...
- All right, now. Take it easy.
You reported her disappearance to the missing persons bureau?
Yes.
Then there's nothing I can do about it.
I'm sorry, but that's out of my department.
Did they cut your heart up into departments too?
That kid's my sister. Any one of a million things could have happened to her.
- What do you expect me to do about it?
- Arrest Vanning.
- Will you testify against him?
- Yes.
Like you did last time?
You'll pardon me, but I don't believe a word you're saying.
You think I'm pretty low, don't you?
Now, what do you expect me to think?
I meet a lot of people in this job.
Some of them I feel sorry for because they... They just can't help themselves.
They don't know any better.
They're the misfits of the world. But you're not that kind.
You know what's right and you know what's wrong.
You know better, but won't do anything.
You choose to think that you can get through the world by outsmarting it.
Well, I've learned that those kind of people generally end up by outsmarting themselves.
And that's exactly what's going to happen to you.
And I won't feel a bit sorry about it, because, lady, you've got it coming to you.
Thanks for telling me.
The coroner's reports.
Oh, Mary, will you come here a moment, please?
Sit down.
They found your sister.
Where?
In the river, dead.
It isn't true.
It isn't true.
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, no.
No, you don't have to be sorry for me.
You were right.
I had it coming to me.
Oh, but why did it have to happen to her? Why did it have to happen to her?
All right. Now, let's go back.
You say that Emmy Lou looked as though something terrible had happened to her?
Did she say anything?
- Well, when she came...
- She didn't say a thing.
I told you before, she went into the bedroom and didn't say a word.
I suppose you didn't hear her say anything?
Well, I was kind of tired and
I wasn't paying much attention.
Oh, why don't you all stop stalling?
You know you heard every word she said.
I said we didn't hear a thing.
Not a thing.
I suppose you girls realize that Emmy Lou is the key witness to this whole business.
Now, you know as well as
I do who murdered Betty.
For years we've waited for Vanning to make one false move, and this is it.
And... Oh, what's the use?
- I thought they were your friends.
- So did I.
If they're not, I don't have to handle them with kid gloves any longer.
Let's understand each other.
I've given you a chance to come on the right side, you turned it down.
Now, when I get Vanning, which I will...
...I'm gonna get everybody connected with him, and that means all of you.
- Mary.
- Get away from me.
- Mary, you got this all wrong.
- Get away from me.
I know you got us down, but what else could we do?
You know the law isn't for people like us.
Then what is?
That's another thing I've been trying to figure out.
Well, I'm sick of figuring things out.
Sure, we know all that. We know how hard it's hit you.
We know what you'd like to do about it. So would we.
We're in a spot.
Remember, once, I wanted to quit this.
You told me there was nothing else we could turn to.
That we didn't know any other way of making a living.
Well, you're right, Mary, we don't.
But if we go to Graham now...
...we're gonna really find out just how tough it can be for us.
That is, if we're lucky enough to be alive that long.
Oh, you can understand that, can't you, Mary?
I only understand that
Betty was my sister...
...that Vanning killed her, and that you won't help me do anything about it.
Mary, there's nothing we or anybody else can do to bring her back.
We can get Vanning, make him pay for it, put him where he belongs.
So what?
So somebody else will take his place.
There will always be somebody else.
Sure, as long as they are gals in the world like us who are afraid of guys like that.
I said that once to a guy I was crazy about.
He worked for Vanning and got into a jam.
I thought I saw a chance for us to get out of this racket without being afraid.
I told him. He listened to me.
They killed him.
I was crazy about him, Mary, just like you were about Betty.
Oh, what's the use?
It all adds up to the same thing if you wanna live.
You took the words right out of my mouth.
What did you tell that DA?
- Did she say anything?
- Nothing.
- Did any of you?
- No.
Why did you go to the law?
Why did you kill my sister?
- Answer me.
- You answer me.
- Why did you kill my sister?
- I don't know what you're talking about.
Maybe Emmy Lou does.
Where is she?
- What did you do with her?
- You listen to me.
You lay off that guy Graham, understand?
You got any beefs, you come to me, I'll straighten them out.
Not this one. You can't.
You heard what I said.
Stay away from that guy.
- And that goes for all of you.
- Not for me, it doesn't.
I'll tell him, and plenty more.
You'll tell him nothing.
All right, get out of here.
Charlie.
- Johnny.
- Shut up, or you'll get the same.
Go ahead, Charlie.
No, no.
Oh, please. Please don't.
Remember, if anybody asks any questions, you came home and found her that way.
Mary. Mary.
All right, break it in.
All right, keep your seats, everybody. This is a raid.
Put that stuff down and stay where you are.
All right, here you are. Break that in.
You better get up there and search that floor.
- Take those girls and line them up here.
- There's not enough room.
Yeah, I know Graham is working fast, but we got to beat him to it.
Tell Williams to put up all the bail they want. The sky's the limit.
Okay. Keep me posted.
Better think fast, Gordon.
It don't look like that
DA is fooling this time.
Either Graham is trying to put on a show to shut up the newspapers...
...or he's got something on you we don't know about.
Nobody's ever got anything on me I don't know about.
Yeah.
Okay, I'll tell him.
Graham is on his way here.
He's after that girl.
He wants to sweat it out of her.
And if he does, you'll fry.
- Get her out of here, fast.
- Take it easy, Gordon.
Nobody's going to get a chance to sweat her.
Charlie.
In a series of raids, police are swooping down on nightclubs and gambling joints...
...owned or controlled by Johnny Vanning.
Neither police nor the DA would disclose the reason...
...for this sudden interest in Mr. Vanning.
It's not hard to guess that it all ties in with the killing of Betty Strauber...
...and the beating of her sister, Mary...
...who is still in serious condition at the General Ho...
All right, Johnny, you wait out here.
Come on, sister, you're going places.
- Where to?
- Never mind. Just places.
Get her stuff out of here.
No. No, I won't go.
I won't. Johnny promised me. He promised me he'd take care of me.
He can't double-cross me. He can't. He cant. No.
Oh, no! No!
No.
Wait a minute, Charlie. Vanning's phoning down. Let's take her to the lobby.
Come out.
Gotta open it.
Get on the phone. Tell the doorman to stop her.
- Tell him she's drunk.
- Right.
Around the back.
- Did you see a blond come through here?
- No, sir.
Get that dame and get her fast.
You feel better now, don't you?
Yes.
- We'll have to go soon.
- Goodbye.
Oh, don't take it so hard, Mary.
The doctor outside told me he could fix that scar so nobody'd ever notice it.
I got things wrong with me that all the doctors in the world can't fix.
Mary, we were figuring that when you got out...
...we'd send you away, maybe to Florida...
...and you could lie in the sun and rest for a few weeks.
It'll do you a lot good.
You'll forget all about this.
How?
By just closing my eyes and pretending it never happened?
I wish it was as easy as that, but it isn't.
You see, I keep seeing that poor little sister of mine...
...lying there with that fear still in her eyes...
...and her pretty little head all twisted.
Me too.
- I see her too, just like you do.
- Emmy Lou.
Mary.
Oh, Mary.
You go on back to headquarters and I'll see you there later.
If you pick up any news of Emmy
Lou, call me here at the hospital.
All right, Mr. Graham.
I didn't mean to take her there, Mary.
- You know I didn't.
- Never mind.
Never mind, Emmy Lou. It's all over now.
There's only one thing that I'm interested in.
- Estelle, call Graham's office, will you?
- What are you gonna do, Mary?
Have Emmy Lou tell him the same story she just told us.
- Do you know what you're doing?
- Sure, I do.
I swore that I'd make Vanning pay for this if it was the last thing I ever did.
Well, why make her pay for it too?
Once she tells Graham, she's gone. Don't you realize that?
And you'll be just as responsible for her being bumped off as Vanning will.
Well?
Go ahead, Mary. It doesn't make any difference anymore.
My number's up anyhow.
He'll get me, just as he'll get every one of you.
As long as we're alive, there's a chance of someone telling.
And Vanning doesn't take chances.
One by one, he'll get us.
Well, maybe if we went to him and said:
"Look, Johnny, you know we won't talk. "
Maybe we could make a deal.
I'm sick of making deals.
Well, you wanna keep on living, don't you?
If this is what you call living,
I don't want any part of it.
Always being afraid.
Never knowing from one day to the next what's going to happen to you.
I'm fed up with being afraid of Vanning or anybody else.
There must be some other way for me to live.
If there isn't, I...
Well, I'd just as soon put a bullet in my head right now and end it.
- Hello, Graham.
- Hello, Mary.
Emmy Lou? What does she know?
- Everything.
- Will she talk?
Yeah, she'll talk, and so will we.
I'm telling you, Johnny, we've got to make a deal.
What do you mean?
Plead guilty. Throw yourself on the mercy of the court.
Mercy? Don't make me laugh.
They've been waiting to get me in a spot like this for years.
We haven't got a chance with that Emmy Lou testifying for them.
- Our only way out is a deal.
- Me?
I don't make no deals with nobody. They make deals with me.
All the time I've been that way, ever since I was that big.
You think I care for money?
All I care about is to make people do what I tell them.
You're crazy, Johnny.
Yeah, maybe I am.
Maybe I ain't.
I just know one thing.
I ain't going to let no five crabby dames put the skids under me now.
You wanna deal? Here it is:
You get word to those dames that maybe I get them before the trial...
...and maybe I got to wait until after it's over.
But if they talk, sure as my name's Johnny Vanning...
...I'll get them.
I wish that guy Graham would stop sending these banquets.
He's ruining my girlish figure.
- Don't have to make a pig out of yourself.
- Well, it's free, why not?
- Come on, Mary, your stuff's getting cold.
- No, I'm not hungry.
Gabby, look.
See that guy down there across the street with the gray hat on?
He looks like Joe Donnera, one of Vanning's pet executioners.
Right. Get away from that window, Mary.
That little hophead isn't out there walking for his health.
That's all.
Be seated.
Proceed with the case of The State v. Vanning.
The state calls Florrie Liggett.
And when Betty got out of the taxi and came up the stoop...
...she had money in her hand, didn't she?
- Yes, sir.
- It was a hundred dollar bill, wasn't it?
- Yes, sir.
Where did she tell you she got that hundred dollar bill?
- From a man at the party.
- Just as a sort of a little present?
No, sir. She said she got it for taxi fare.
She told you that she accepted a hundred dollar bill for taxi fare?
Yes, sir. We always got that at Johnny's parties.
Thank you. That's all.
The state calls Estelle Porter.
- You knew the deceased, Betty Strauber?
- Yes, sir.
Will you speak a little louder so the jury can hear you?
Yes, sir.
- What kind of a girl would you say she was?
- She was the sweetest kid you ever saw.
And up until very recently...
...she didn't know the kind of work you and her sister were doing?
No, sir. She thought we were models in a dress shop.
Mary kept her in a swell school.
Wanted her to grow up to be a god kid, and...
Objection, as irrelevant and cheap pathos...
...in an attempt to play on the sympathies of the jury.
I merely offer it in rebuttal to the cheap insinuations cast upon the character...
...of the deceased Betty Strauber.
Overruled. Proceed.
The state calls Dorothy
Marvin, known as Gabby Marvin.
Then why did you refuse to talk about this case to the district attorney at first?
I had a reason.
And was it for the same reason that you tried to persuade the other girls not to talk?
- Yes.
- And just what was that reason?
- Vanning.
- What do you mean, Vanning?
A boy I was crazy about used to work for him.
He wanted to get out of this racket so we could go away together.
But he knew too much.
Vanning wouldn't let him out.
So the boyfriend got sore and talked.
George, he was that kind of a guy, sort of hotheaded and wild...
Never mind that. What happened?
They found him in a ditch, full of slugs.
The state calls Mary Dwight.
When you defied Vanning's command to stay away from the law...
...and threatened to tell me all you knew about him, what did he do?
- He slapped me hard right across the mouth.
- And then what happened?
He ordered all the other girls to leave the room.
And after they left?
Charlie and another member of the gang went to work on me.
And by that you mean?
They started slapping me around.
They'd keep crashing their big fists in my face.
And threatening me with worse...
...if I didn't keep my mouth shut like Johnny said.
Then when I fell down, they started kicking me.
Oh, I begged them to lay off, but they wouldn't stop.
Then when I saw Charlie...
...lean over me and take out his knife...
...I screamed and fainted.
And you don't remember anything that happened after that?
No, not until I woke up in the hospital.
Was there any particular reason why
Charlie cut that cross on your cheek?
Sure.
Sure, that's Johnny's little trademark for anyone who double-crosses him.
Emmy Lou Eagan, take the stand.
Then Betty pleaded with Vanning not to make her go with Mr. Crandall.
And that only made Johnny mad.
He grabbed her, and when she tried to fight him off...
...he hit her and she fell down the stairs.
- She fell down the stairs?
- Yes, sir.
Then Vanning didn't deliberately push or throw her down the stairs, did he?
Well, no, sir. He hit her so hard she lost her balance and...
Accidentally fell down the stairs, isn't that right?
- Yes, sir.
- Then Vanning didn't kill her?
- He did. He did.
- But you said it was an accident.
- Now, which is it?
- He killed her, I'm telling you.
I saw him, and that's why he wanted to kill me too.
And in summing up, I cannot impress upon you too strongly...
...you must never lose sight of the background of this case...
...a viciously ruthless background from which sprang the motive...
...for this killing of an innocent girl.
You should consider not only Vanning the murderer...
...but also Vanning the vice czar...
...who at this very moment is exacting his staggering tribute...
...from a supine and cowardly city.
To defend this empire of vice and crime...
...Vanning is pursuing the same methods he used in building and maintaining it:
Insidious bribery to corrupt, brutal violence to intimidate...
...and cold-blooded murder to silence any who dared protest.
Had all these succeeded as they had so often in the past...
...I wouldn't be here prosecuting Vanning for murder.
And why did he fail?
Was it because our leading citizens had risen in righteous indignation...
...to rid the city of this criminal racketeer?
Ladies and gentlemen...
...these leading citizens, men of reputation, men of standing, men of righteousness...
...who cried to high heavens that the city was overrun with crime and corruption...
...when they were called upon to testify, to do something about it...
...to risk even a little, did they? No.
They were either too busy or too afraid.
Out of all the teeming millions of this great city...
...only five girls had the courage to take their very lives in their hands...
...and accuse Johnny Vanning.
In spite of all threats of reprisals, the horror of which they knew too well...
...they were ready to appear before you to testify.
And let me be the first to admit the truth of the accusations...
...that were brought against these girls in a desperate effort to discredit them.
Frankly, they're... They're everything the defense has said they are.
Their characters are questionable.
Their profession, unsavory and distasteful.
Oh, it's not been difficult to crucify them, but it has been difficult to crucify the truth.
And that truth is that these girls...
...in the face of sheer, stark terrorism, did appear in court...
...exposed themselves to the public gaze, told the truth about themselves...
...told the world what they really are.
Then surely you must believe that they were telling the truth...
...when they testified that
Johnny Vanning was responsible...
...for the death of Betty Strauber.
And if you do believe that...
...there is but one verdict you can reach, and that is guilty.
Be seated.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, have you reached a verdict?
- We have, Your Honor.
- Hand it to the clerk.
Read it.
"We, the jury, in the above entitled cause...
...find the defendants guilty on counts one, two, three and four. "
Your Honor, at this time we give oral notice of our intention...
...to move for a new trial.
An intelligent, courageous and discriminating jury...
...has found you, Vanning, guilty of heading a combination...
...to commit and profit from every vicious and reprehensible crime.
This makes you responsible, in law and morals, for every foul and cruel deed...
...performed at your command by your henchmen.
The evidence against you is overwhelming.
Your previous record shows you to be an incorrigible criminal...
...a low and brutal character...
...an unprincipled and aggressive egotist.
It is my sworn duty to administer to each of you...
...the justice and punishment of an outraged community.
But before I do, let me warn you...
...that should any of the people's witnesses be injured or harassed...
...specifically, if anything should happen to those five girls...
...the court will request the parole authorities to retain in prison...
...the defendants against whom such witnesses testified...
...for the maximum terms of the sentences to be imposed.
Since all of you have been found guilty on every count in the indictment...
...it is the judgment and sentence of this court that you be imprisoned...
...for a term of not less than 30 nor more than 50 years in the state penitentiary.
Well, that's that.
Come on, kids.
Let's go.
- Congratulations.
- Nice work, Dave.
Just a minute, Mr. Graham.
Look this way, please.
Joe.
Johnny says to lay off.
Okay.
Mary.
Yes.
Aren't you gonna wait?
What for?
- It's all over, isn't it?
- Over?
Why, sure.
You better go back inside.
They all wanna congratulate you.
Oh, no, you're the one that should be getting the congratulations, not me.
I don't want them.
- But where will you go?
- Places.
- But what will you do?
- Do?
Oh, I'll get along. I always have.
Mary, I'd like to help you.
- Why?
- Why? Because I...
Because I think you've got a break coming to you.
And?
And I'd like to see that you get it.
What's the use of stalling?
We both live in different worlds, that's the way we gotta leave it.
I don't want to leave it that way.
I said to you that if you ever started helping yourself...
...I'd be the first one to go to bat for you.
And that still goes.
No matter what you do or where you go...
...we'll meet again.
Goodbye, Graham.
I'll be seeing you.
- Here's Graham.
- Been looking all over for you.
How about pictures of our next DA?
What do you mean DA?
He'll be our next governor.
Come on. Give that old personality smile.
You know, Graham, the old chin out.
- Attaboy.
- Just a couple of more now, Graham.
Wait a minute, Graham.
Carl Denham.
Mrs. Hudson! Mrs. Hudson!
Get out! I'll have you arrested.
That's my business...
Pretending to be the gas man.
- I'm supposed to...
- The very idea.
All right, Mr. Denham. It's only me.
I am sorry, Mr. Denham. He said he was the gas man. Had a card and everything.
Listen, Mrs. Hudson, as long as I am rooming in your house... if your own father comes to the door, don't you believe a word he says.
It's a pity the people in New York don't try and catch a few gunmen... instead of hunting a nice gentleman like you.
Is Mrs. Hudson there?
Oh, ho. That's the lady in the front room.
- Oh.
- Coming.
I'm from the news.
Is that so? Well, I've got news for you:
You're going to get out of this room so fast...
- No, I'm not.
- Ladies, no riots, please.
If people don't stop getting into my house under false pretenses...
I just want a story.
If I go back without it, I'll lose my job.
- Don't bother to pull that old line.
- You're big news, you know.
What, after a whole month?
That's time enough for New York to forget the World War.
The War was a long way off, but King Kong, the giant ape...
- ...was right here on the spot.
- So I've heard.
And you're the man that brought him here.
Kong is dead. But everybody's interested in you, too, Mr. Denham.
All those people that Kong killed and injured... all the property owners who are suing you for damages, and...
And the theater owners, and the men who put money in advanced publicity, and...
Say, are you telling me?
Why don't you let him alone? He hasn't dared leave the house for a week.
That's what I want, the personal reaction story.
You want to know what the captor of the late Kong...
- ...thinks about, eh?
- Yes.
I thought I had him safe.
Don't you suppose I'm sorry for the harm he did?
I wish I'd left him on his island.
Old Kong, I'm sure paying for what I did to you.
Mrs. Hudson, suppose we look out and count the gentlemen in disguise... who are waiting for me?
If I don't get out of this house pretty soon, I'll choke.
Hey!
Aren't you going to give me a story?
All right, tell my public that Carl Denham, the bright boy... who was going to make a million dollars out of King Kong, is flat broke.
Everybody in New York is suing me for something.
The only place I haven't heard from is the Bide-A-Wee home.
But, Mr. Denham, my readers want to know...
There's a newsboy and a peddler and a taxi driver out there.
I'll bet you a nickel they're all process servers.
- There's a man coming up the steps.
- Huh?
Why, it's Charlie. Let him in.
- Hello, Charlie, what do you want?
- Captain Englehorn send you this.
- Where'd you come from?
- All time, stay on ship.
- Cook for Skipper. Easy job.
- Mm.
Tell the Skipper I'll be over at the ship as soon as I can get out of here.
- What's matter? You scared to come out now?
- You said it. Much obliged, Charlie.
- Maybe you can get out through the basement.
- Come on. Let's try it.
Rags.
Bottles, rags.
You've got a nerve.
I got everything, lady.
And I buy everything.
Rags, bones.
Say, you fresh guy!
Mrs. Hudson.
Mr. Carl Denham.
Well, I'll be. Hello, Mickey.
- Hello.
- Have a heart, will you?
That's 15 of those things you've slipped me.
- I'm the best in the business, Mr. Denham.
- Well, what is it this time?
Steiner and Wayne.
Destruction of property by Kong on 39th street.
Shock, mental anguish, and sprained ankle to owner of said property.
If I don't get out of this house,
I'll bite somebody.
Listen, Mickey, I've got a date.
You've done your job.
How about helping me out-smart those other guys?
Mr. Denham, I'll give you a ride on my junk wagon.
You... Ha, ha. You mean to say you've got a wagon to go with that makeup?
Mr. Denham, I'm an artist.
Hey.
How did you get in there?
You can go from the roof to chimney.
Anthony St. Nick and Santa Claus.
Ooh. Commence.
Rags.
Bottles. Bones.
Rags. Hey, you can take off the tin hat.
You're safe now.
Where are you going, Mr. Denham?
Drop me at the nearest subway station, James.
You know, it's funny how anybody's troubles are somebody's gain.
I've been working steady since you got in this jam.
You've no idea how that cheers me up.
The boy who was going to make a million dollars.
Rags!
So that's the mess I'm in, Skipper.
Kong sure was a hoodoo for me.
I guess next time you leave big monkey alone, huh?
Next time? Ha, ha.
Charlie must think Kongs are plentiful.
Well, Denham, now I'll tell you why I wanted to see you.
- I've got a plan for both of us-
- What is it?
Going to get a couple of megaphones and run sightseeing trips around the harbor?
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Mr. Denham, I...
Mickey.
- One more summons and I'll brain you.
- No, wait, Mr. Denham.
I ain't got no summons. Honest. I ain't.
I come to tip you off.
- Did you follow me over here?
- No, I live over here.
My father-in-law said he saw you come in by the gates.
I feel very friendly to you, Mr. Denham.
You've kept me working pretty steady lately.
Yeah, sure, I know, I've been a big help.
Now, what's on your mind?
I heard this afternoon you're going to be indicted.
- What?
- Indicted.
- The grand jury's going to indict you.
- Let me out of this. I'm going crazy.
You take my tip and get out.
Summons is one thing and grand jury is something else already.
- They are going to put you on the stand.
- Stop it! All right, Mickey, much obliged.
- Now beat it, will you?
- All right. Such a fine customer.
Oh, Denham?
- Denham, I...
- What good is the grand jury?
What can they find out?
I brought Kong back here, he got loose, did a lot of damage... got killed, and that's that.
- What can I do about it?
- We can go to jail for 10 years.
- What do you mean, "we"?
- I'm in it, too, up to my neck.
Now, see here. This ship's still mine.
There are no attachments on her yet.
- They just haven't got around to you.
- That's a good reason for hurrying.
In three hours, I can get together a skeleton crew, enough to handle her.
Yeah, and we'll go yachting.
We can make some sort of a living carrying freight.
Take the East Indies.
There are hundreds of little ports there that no sizable ship ever goes to.
- I know that part of the world.
- What'll we use for money?
Well, I... I've saved up a little.
Enough to get us started.
- Yes, but...
- Come on, Denham.
You know, Skipper... you're pretty swell to be willing to take me with you.
- Is it a go, then?
- What?
To be off on this old ship again, out of all this?
Say, you bet it's a go.
Well, this looks like a hustling community, Skipper.
Suppose we can get any business here?
Better get some soon, or we won't be able to pay the crew.
Say, uh, how far is it to Kong's island?
1,753 miles.
Well, you're pretty glib with that.
You must have been checking up.
Huh? Oh.
I just happened to come across our old chart last night... and I was curious.
Yeah, sure.
- Bosun.
- Yes, sir.
Get that number two hatch off and break out the cargo.
That won't take very long.
If we weren't so short-handed,
I'd get rid of that man.
He's a troublemaker.
Of course, Wong Ho would have to ship his copra last week.
Well, let's see.
There's a couple of half-caste traders here.
We might see them tomorrow...
- ...and get a bit of a cargo.
- Look, Skipper. There's a show in town.
- I'll bet it's terrible.
- Don't be a crab, Skipper. It's a show.
We ought to see it.
- I want a drink and some dinner.
- There's plenty of time for that.
You don't mean to say you're going to miss the sagacious seals?
Don't you want to laugh and thrill with La Belle Helene?
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you.
Come, Bobby. Come, George.
Come, Fattima. In with you.
And now, La Belle Helene!
Sweet songstress who has appeared before all the crowned heads of Europe... will conclude the performance... with one of her most popular songs.
La Belle Helene!
Oh, I've got the runaway blues
I want to wander away
Oh, I've got the runaway blues today
Don't want to stay
I know that trains are going somewhere
And steamers are sailing the blue
They go, but baby, what do I care?
'Cause none of them's going to you
Poor kid.
- You know, she's got something.
- It certainly isn't the voice.
Voice, who cares? She's got personality.
Somebody'd show her what to do with it.
I hear the steamer whistle crying
Whoo, whoo
It's just an echo when I'm sighing
Whoo, whoo
You ran away and never told me
What for, what for
And now your arms will never hold me
No more, no more
I don't want the train on the track
Don't want the ship on the sea
Why? 'Cause they ain't bringing you back to me
Poor me
Thank you for your kind reception of our efforts.
And remember, another big show here tomorrow night.
Well, if that's your idea of a pleasant evening, I...
It's interesting, Skipper.
I'll bet you could take a kid like that... and put her over to the producer of a musical comedy.
- But not to the captain of a freighter.
- Ha, ha.
Father, is that man coming again tonight?
Yes, he is. Any objection?
Can't I have a friend drop in?
- He isn't a friend.
- Well, he's a white man...
- ...somebody to talk to.
- Somebody to drink with.
That's enough. Shut up now and go to bed.
You can't get away from here. No money.
How you think you can get away from here? Huh?
Your Dutchman will be here in a couple of days, won't he?
Dutch magistrate? Ha!
What do you think he'll do for you?
He don't care what happens to you and your rotten little show.
Not a rotten show.
I was ringmaster in the biggest circus.
Used to play Colombo, Singapore.
Sure, and you was rotten.
Who're you calling... Who are you?
- Rotten captain!
- You lay off me.
Rotten captain, lost ship.
Lost it on purpose, eh?
Tried to get the insurance...
- ...didn't you?
- Shut up.
Poor captain.
Lost ship, lost job.
Lost certificate.
Ah, dry up, you old tramp.
You're a tramp.
No certificate, no job.
You're no better than me.
And you just lay off my liquor, will you?
Give it back.
Father! Father!
Father!
Father, Father, tell me what happened.
Who did it?
Tony.
Tony, come down.
Tony.
Tony, please, come down.
Tony.
Tony.
- Tony.
- You'll never catch a monkey that way.
- Did you ever catch a monkey?
- Did I ever...? Ha, ha.
Lady, you'd be surprised.
They won't come back.
Oh, well, why should they?
Oh, uh...
I saw your show last night.
How'd the monkeys get away?
I had to let them out.
The tent burned.
Where's the man who owns the show?
He's my father.
He was hurt.
He's dead.
Well, what a tough break.
I'm sorry, kid.
My father used to be with World Wide.
- That's the biggest circus in the East.
- Yes, I know. What did you do?
I was in the ballet.
I wasn't very good.
What happened to World Wide?
Well, my father... Well, he sort of drank.
You know.
And...
They didn't want him anymore.
- So he started his own show.
- Yes.
Well, we just had a few monkeys.
It wasn't very good.
Say, that's no way to talk.
"I wasn't very good, the show wasn't very good."
Cut it out! You want to tell everybody how good you are.
Throw out your chest. Brag about yourself.
Oh.
So you're in the show business too.
No, I'm in the shipping business.
- I just put in with the cargo.
- Oh.
I thought maybe you had a show, and I could...
No, I'm sorry.
Well, I've got a date.
Are you going to be all right?
I mean, have you got any money?
Yes.
Well, keep your chin up.
I'll be seeing you.
Miss, I heard about your father.
- If I could do anything...
- You've done enough.
You killed my father.
Killed? Why, what...?
The tent caught fire.
My father was beaten over the head.
He wasn't burned.
What do you think the magistrate will say to that when he gets here?
You can't accuse me.
- You wasn't there.
- How do you know I wasn't?
Unless you were.
How do you know what my father said to me before he...?
Before he died?
He... What did he say?
The magistrate will be here in a few days.
I'll tell him.
You better be careful.
What are you going to tell the magistrate?
You can just wonder about that till he gets here.
- There isn't a pound of cargo for us here.
- What'll we do now?
Might pick up some business in the Banda group.
It's a dull life, Skipper.
We need excitement.
Carl Denham.
Don't you remember me?
- Nils Helstrom.
- Well, for the love of Mike. Helstrom.
Sure, I remember you.
This is Captain Englehorn.
Captain Helstrom. Sit down.
Say, do you know who this is?
The man who gave me the map of Kong's island.
And he wants to know if I remember him. Ha-ha-ha!
Have a drink.
So, that was your ship came in last night?
Mine and Denham's.
I heard about you in Singapore.
How you'd captured the biggest animal on earth and taken him back to New York.
Agh.
I'm down, Denham.
- Don't you think you owe me something?
- Ha, ha.
Well, sir, you certainly came to the right man.
- How about a 50-50 split?
- You mean that?
Sure, I mean it. I'll give you half of everything I made out of King Kong.
- How much would that come to?
- Well, let's see, 10... no, 11 lawsuits and the privilege of being indicted by the grand jury too.
- Ah. Then you're broke too?
- Broke? I'm shattered.
Well, then how about giving me passage on your ship?
- I want to get away from here.
- Where's your own ship?
I lost her on the Banka reefs.
- Tough luck. No job since?
- Everyone is down on me.
It wasn't my fault.
You know what those waters are like.
Will you take me to some port that isn't Dutch?
- What's the matter with the Dutch?
- I tell you, they're down on me.
I want to make a fresh start.
You realize how far we'd have to go to land you out of Dutch, uh... jurisdiction?
We can't run all over the Indian Ocean carrying one passenger.
Sorry, old man. Have another drink.
But, Denham, when you got Kong off that island... didn't you get the treasure?
- What?
- Didn't you find the treasure?
Find it?
Why, I never even heard of it.
- Say, are you kidding me?
- Why should I?
To tell the truth, I had an idea
I'd go and look for it myself someday.
You held out on me, eh?
How much do you know about this treasure?
Well, not a lot.
Dying native I picked up at sea...
You drew the map from his description, and he told you about the great wall.
Yeah, he talked about the treasure of the island.
Who put it there?
Why, the people who built the wall.
Yes, that might be.
Skipper, do you remember I said there wasn't a reason... on Earth for going back?
Look. The answer to a prayer.
We're off again.
Hello. I heard you were stopping here.
Felt a little worried about you.
Thought I'd better see you before I go.
- Are you going?
- Yes. Off tonight in a big rush.
- On your ship?
- Yeah, sure.
There isn't any other way to get out of this place, is there?
Oh, uh, here, you take this.
- Can't I go too?
- What?
- Let me go on your ship.
- Nix, kid, nix.
We're going on a long voyage.
We won't be putting in at any port where we could leave you.
Don't leave me. Please, take me with you.
I won't be any trouble.
I'll just sit on the ship.
I won't talk or anything.
Listen, kid, I can't. Honest.
Now, you take this money and buy yourself a passage on the next ship... that's going where you want to go.
- Go on, take it.
- Let me go with you.
Please. Please.
No, no, no, nothing doing.
Now, you take it. Sorry it isn't more, but that's the best I can do.
There'll be a schooner or something along pretty soon.
I can't take you, kid. You'll be okay.
You just make a plan and stick to it.
- All right.
- That's a good girl.
It's a pretty tough life, isn't it?
Well...
Good luck.
- Weather's made-to-order, Skipper.
- I hope it holds.
The next land we sight will be Kong's island.
Yeah.
That fellow Helstrom is getting too chummy with the crew.
- I don't like it.
- Why don't you call him down for it?
What's your opinion of Helstrom?
Well, he got in some trouble over losing his ship, I guess.
That's pretty plain.
He certainly was anxious to leave Dakang.
And he isn't at all anxious to get to Kong's island.
Have you noticed him when we talked about the time we were there?
- Think he's scared?
- Scared green.
Green now and yellow later on, eh?
- Does he expect us to go ashore?
- Why, sure.
He's got to have a bodyguard, hasn't he?
Say... do you know there was a dozen sailors killed on the last voyage he made here?
- Killed? By them animals?
- Yeah.
But, you see, Denham and the skipper came out all right.
But you don't have to worry.
There's plenty of rifles aboard.
If I was captain, I certainly wouldn't take my crew into danger.
- Hey!
- What?
Wha...?
Hey, Bill.
Where?
Hey, Connelly.
If you want me to, I'll give Helstrom a tip that he's too thick with the crew.
Go ahead. Bad for discipline.
We must be in Russia. Here comes the Committee of the Workers.
- Captain Englehorn.
- Well?
- Captain, I went down in forward hold.
- Well, what of it?
- Captain, I found something.
- What's the matter? Found what?
Holy mackerel.
- I just didn't have anywhere to go.
- All right, go back to your work.
This young lady a friend of yours,
Mr. Denham?
No. Well... yes. I met her, that is,
I talked with her in Dakang.
Look here, this isn't my fault.
I told her she couldn't come.
Well...
We can't take her back. Mr. Helstrom.
You ought to be beaten to a pulp.
You called me?
Yes, we have a passenger, and she...
You. How did you get here?
This is our partner.
I know him.
You do?
Yes, of course, you couldn't help seeing each other in Dakang, could you?
Well, here we are.
Just one big, happy family.
You take the words right out of my mouth.
You keep your mouth shut.
You promise me to keep quiet.
I won't promise.
You crazy brat. Denham's sore at you anyway for being here.
You try to make trouble between us, and he'll be off you for life.
Skipper's looking for you.
Say, I don't know what's the matter with you and Helstrom... but we're all cooped up together on this ship.
I didn't ask you to come.
You're here on your own hook.
No matter who you like or dislike... you've got to behave and be pleasant.
Understand?
Are you mad at me?
Not very.
It's, uh... This is nice, isn't it?
It's all right.
Mr. Denham.
- Mr. Denham.
- Yeah?
Skipper says get dressed and come on deck.
Okay. What is it?
Have we sighted the island?
Yes, sir, about two miles off.
- Say, it's a thrill coming back here.
- Yes, sir.
You had a pretty bad time when you were here before, didn't you?
Yeah, it's a pretty tough spot.
The natives will be glad to see us.
We did them a good turn once, and I...
What the...?
I'm warning you all.
You're crazy to do a thing like this.
We're not crazy enough to go to that island.
- What is it, Skipper? Is this on the level?
- It's real enough.
- Where's Helstrom? They get him too?
- All right.
Over that side to the lifeboat.
All of you.
So this is why you've been spending so much time in the foxhole.
- What do you think you're doing?
- We know what we're doing.
Come on, get over the side.
You can row yourselves to your blasted island and stay there.
Yes, and if those animals kill anybody, it won't be us.
Yes. Get going.
Because you pay us your dirty money, you think you own us.
You sweat and drive us, but you don't give us a living wage for our blood and sweat.
- When did you do all this sweating?
- You think you own us, body and soul.
- Oh, listen to reason.
- We've listened enough.
We've got the ship and we're going to keep it.
- Over the side.
- You're not going to shove this kid off too.
She followed you aboard the ship, she can follow you off.
Do you think I want to stay? I know.
Here's your chance to get rid of me.
- He killed my father.
- What?
He was a drunken old tramp.
I didn't kill him.
I know you did.
He said you'd be angry if I tried to make trouble.
Well, what a fine partner you've turned out to be.
Aw, pipe down. Get going.
Of course, you know what this will mean when you get caught.
Listen, I'll call the whole thing off now.
We'll turn back.
Sure, and be arrested for mutiny as soon as we reach port.
I'll give you my word I won't report you.
It's too late for that kind of talk.
We'll stick by what we've done.
Over the side and see how you like it.
I'll be seeing you again, I hope.
What do you think the chances are?
- Charlie, they throw you off too?
- No throw off. Get off.
Me no like them men.
- Cast off.
- Wait.
Aren't you going to give us any guns?
We've given you food and water.
You're lucky to get that.
A smart man like you don't need a gun.
Good boy, Charlie.
You cook now, you die pretty soon.
Row, you blasted bourgeois.
You got a nice day for it.
Now, then, go to your places.
Stokers below.
Bosun.
- Get that ladder up.
- What was that?
I said, get the ladder up.
Oh! And I promote you.
- You'll be mate now.
- That's fine. Who's gonna be captain?
I'm taking command, of course.
Clear the decks. Get back to work.
Do you think that we got rid of a good captain... so we could have a bad one?
We're through with captains on this ship.
He wants to be boss.
Let him go with the rest of the bosses.
Yo-ho!
Ha!
That's where all captains belong, over the side.
Bon voygee, Captain Helstrom.
Something tells me we've got a passenger.
Well...
How nice to see you again, under the circumstances.
Skipper, have we got to save him?
Hey, Skipper, when the natives see us,
I bet they'll throw a party.
Well, maybe not a party.
It's the chief.
Hey, did you throw that, you rat?
He says yes, he did, because his village is destroyed... and his people are killed, and it's all our fault for leading Kong inside the wall.
Well, tell him not to attack us.
Tell him we overcame Kong... and we're still big mates.
Come on, Charlie, shove off.
We've got to find another place to land.
What's the good of this?
There's no way out.
Well, it's the only place we've seen where we could get a foot ashore.
Maybe we can climb up someplace.
You stick with me, kid.
A fly couldn't climb out of here.
Yeah, here's a way out.
Wait till I take a look.
- Uh, captain, I...
- Huh?
- About that mutiny, I...
- The less said, the better, Helstrom.
We're all in a tight place together, and I don't think you'll let us down.
No, no, of course not.
Of course not.
- I didn't know that you came.
- You said stick to you.
Do you obey orders?
Why doesn't Denham come back?
We'd better go look for him.
A smart man like you don't need a gun.
Ha!
Look!
Well, if it isn't the little Kong.
He's stuck in the quicksand.
He can't get out.
I never knew that old Kong had a son.
Don't you think we ought to help him?
Well, how?
If we could get logs and things to him, maybe he could get out.
- Aren't you afraid of him?
- Yes, sort of.
Well...
It sounds kind of silly, but I'm sorry for him.
So am I. But I've got a reason.
Animals always know when you're trying to help them.
I don't believe he'd hurt us if he got out.
I suppose we're both crazy, but let's try.
Look out, Skipper, that's quicksand.
Skipper, there's a...
Skipper, believe it or not, there's a little Kong.
What? A little...
- How little?
- Well, just a little one.
- About 12 feet high.
- Good...
Well, what happened? What did you do?
I know it sounds funny, but instead of shooting him, I helped him out of a jam.
I felt...
Well...
I felt I owed his family something.
You really feel conscience-stricken about King Kong, don't you?
Whatever you do, don't mention Little Kong to Helstrom.
- He'd have a nervous breakdown.
- I'd like to break his neck.
We ought to go hunting and save our rations for emergencies.
This is cut right into the side of Skull Mountain.
My guess, that temple.
- Maybe big devil live in there.
- A temple?
Helstrom, suppose the treasure should be hidden here.
That certainly would be wonderful.
- You'd better come along with me, Helstrom.
- We'll meet here at sundown.
My go with Skipper.
Unh!
I'd forgotten you.
You'd better wait right here.
We'll all be back soon.
Do you think I'm going to stay here alone?
Well, all right, then, come on with me.
But be quiet.
And don't talk.
I thought tropical jungles were full of fruit.
That's what everybody thinks who's never been...
Look.
Well, we won't starve, anyway.
Good boy, Little Kong.
Say, can he scrap, just like his old man.
- Look, he's hurt.
- Huh?
Poor Little Kong.
Do you suppose he knew he was helping us?
Of course not.
You want me to believe he was grateful?
Well, he did save us, didn't he?
And how do we know what animals think?
Let's go and help him.
Are you game?
Yes, if you are.
Wait.
If you talk, very calmly... sometimes that keeps animals quiet.
- You frightened him.
- Yeah, that's too bad.
Was I too rough with him?
Poor old boy.
Baby Kong.
Yeah, some baby.
You're not a patch on your old man.
I must be completely cuckoo to be doing this.
Giving you a ﬁrst-aid treatment instead of running like blazes.
Guess it must be remorse or something.
You see...
I'm the guy that knocked out your pop with a gas bomb and then... carried him off to New York in chains.
I've been sorry for it ever since.
Yeah, you see, the poor old geezer got shot at the finish.
I guess if I'd left him alone... we'd all have been better off.
This is sort of an apology.
There you are, boy.
Two good deeds in one day for something that size... we ought to be caught up on our good deeds for a year.
I wish I had one of those coconuts.
I'll see what I can do about it.
Hey, look what you're doing, you big dummy.
I wish you'd be a little more careful of what you wish for.
Hey.
You better lie down and do your sleeping.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to go to sleep.
I was helping you keep watch.
I have to keep watch of you.
That's the third time I've caught you.
Aren't you going to signal the others again?
Well, there's no use wasting any more ammunition.
They'd have answered those shots
I ﬁred if they'd heard them.
You better lie down.
Here.
Take my coat for a pillow.
- You'll need it.
- No, I won't. I'll keep the fire going.
There you are.
You're a grand little scout.
I'm sorry I got you into all this mess, kid.
You didn't.
I came.
Well, then I'm glad they wouldn't let you stay on the ship.
But I'm just another trouble.
You told me not to come on the boat.
- Good night, kid.
- Good night.
It's gone.
What fashion animal you call that, huh? I no like.
Here's your gun.
Well, that leaves only one shotgun among us.
It's light enough now.
We better go and look for Denham and the girl.
Mm. Heh.
- Well.
- Good morning.
Good morning.
- No sign of the Skipper?
- No.
I'll fire one more shot.
Our guardian angel.
Hey, look.
I'm going to try and get into this place.
If you have no objections.
You're sure you don't mind?
Well, that's fine.
Listen, you attend to your business and I'll attend to mine.
Look! The treasure!
The treasure of the island!
I was expecting you.
Come on, baby.
We've found it!
Please, Little Kong, help us.
Hand it down.
Attaboy, Kong.
Stick to me, kid, and you'll wear diamonds.
Look at them.
Just look at them. We're rich.
We're all rich.
Well, what are you going to do with them?
Huh?
Yeah, I guess maybe a sailboat would be more useful.
Hey, put that down.
Hey, look out!
You'll shoot yourself, you half-wit.
Hey!
Hey, look out! You want to kill somebody?
Sure, you've fixed everything now.
You big rummy.
Do you think he's dead?
Denham.
That's the Skipper.
- What's happened? Where's your gun?
- It's broken, Skipper, but listen...
What? Both guns gone? We can't stay here. Let's go back to the boat.
Helstrom, the treasure, I...
You fool, there never was any treasure.
Let's go, let's get out of here.
Then that was just a yarn you were giving me.
Of course. I had to tell you that to get away from Dakang.
Then there isn't any treasure at all?
Helstrom. Helstrom.
- He's going to the boat.
- Why, that crazy fool may take it.
Let's go after him.
I'm going back for the rest of the treasure.
Make sure of the boat.
I'll catch up with you. Hurry!
Earthquake!
My poor kid.
It doesn't seem to matter very much.
Stick to me and you'll wear diamonds.
Look.
Look.
Ship.
Ship.
Hello, kid.
What are you thinking about?
Poor Little Kong.
Do you suppose he knew he was saving my life?
Well, I'm sure he did.
Pretty soon, when we get back... you'll be saying goodbye to me, won't you?
Yeah.
What?
Where are you going?
I don't know.
Well, you'll have plenty of money, kid.
We'll split the treasure four ways.
Couldn't you just split it... three ways?
How do you mean?
Well... one-third to the Skipper, one-third to Charlie... and one-third... to us.
Well, you said stick to you.
This is nice, isn't it?
It's all right.
That's the most
I got is 3,000 bottle of crème de menthe.
You got things pretty much your own way now, haven't you, Louis?
Sure.
Everything is just fine.
That's good.
But Pete was saying just tonight...
He say that the South Side, she's get out of line.
I say, what are we gonna do with the South Side?
Let some of the other boys get theirs, too. I got all I wanted.
Johnny Lovo, he's talking about starting something.
Yeah?
He's looking for trouble, eh?
Johnny's very foolish!
Look at me.
A man always got to know whether he's got it or not. I got plenty.
I got house. I got automobile.
I got nice girl.
I got stomach trouble, too.
Better get some sleep.
All right.
Well, she was a pretty good party, eh?
Next week,
I'm going to give the party which the boys ain't never seen nothing like it before.
We'll have much more music, much more girls, much more everything.
Everybody, should say, "Big Louis, he sit on top of the world!" Eh?
- Goodbye, Louis.
- Goodbye, boys.
Take good careful of yourselves, eh?
- Bye.
- I see you some more.
Hello. I want
Lakeside 417, please.
Yeah, 417 Lakeside. Sure.
That's the wrong...
No, I want Lakeside 417.
Hello, Louis.
Hello.
How many of them?
All right.
Hello.
Copyboy here.
Copyboy!
That's rotten!
"Costillo slaying starts gang war!"
That's what I want.
I'm working on that angle now.
- I've got four men on it.
- Four?
You'll need 40 men on this story for the next five years.
You know what's happening?
This town is up for the grabs. Get me?
You know, Costillo was the last of the old-fashioned gang leaders.
There's a new crew coming out.
And every guy that's got money enough to buy a gun is going to try to step into his place.
You see?
They'll be shooting each other like rabbits for the control of the booze business!
You get it?
It'll be just like war!
That's it, "war."
You put that in the lead.
"War. Gang war."
Here come the coppers!
Hello, Rinaldo.
You coming along?
Where's Camonte?
- Hello, Guarino.
- Come on.
What's your hurry?
I'm getting a massage, too.
We'll finish that at headquarters.
Put your coat on.
I got lots of time.
Who wants to see me?
The Chief.
That kidney foot?
Never mind the jokes.
Come on.
Hey, how's it look in the back?
Very good.
Come on, you rat!
Come on.
"Tony Camonte, aliases Cabrone, Joe Black.
"Assault, carrying brass knuckles and sap, DW, disturbing peace.
"Street robbery on three counts, loft burglary, violation Volstead Act.
"Indicted for murder of Buck Kempner.
"Member, Five Point's Gang, came from New York, 1920.
"At present, bodyguard and strong-arm for Louis Costillo."
Bodyguard for Costillo, eh?
Pretty smart boy.
I suppose you didn't kill
Louis Costillo?
Who, me?
That's very funny.
Big Louis and me, we're like this.
Can I slap it out of him,
Chief?
I'll let you have him in a little while, Ben.
This fellow got ideas
I don't like.
Costillo hired you for a bodyguard.
Where were you at the shooting?
I was having my beauty sleep.
Where?
In a lady's house.
You want her name?
Phone number?
She's very nice.
We'll go into your alibis later.
You've been hanging around
Johnny Lovo, haven't you?
Lovo split with Big Louis.
What were you doing at Lovo's house last week?
Now listen, Tony,
I'm gonna give you a chance.
You play ball with me and I'll play ball with you.
Last night, you met Johnny in Spinelli's Barber Shop.
What did he give you money for?
Now listen, you.
What kind of mug you think I am?
I don't know nothing, I don't see nothing and I don't hear nothing.
And when I do, I don't tell a cop.
You understand?
All right, Guarino, you can have him.
Thanks.
Come on, Tony.
We'll take a look at the goldfish.
Here's Epstein.
Hi, boys. Hello, Chief.
All right, let's have it.
Writ of habeas corpus for the release of Tony Camonte and Guino Rinaldo.
- Who gave it to you?
- Flemming.
All right, gentlemen, see you later.
- Hey, I don't go with this guy?
- No.
Listen to me.
You've come into this town and you think you're headed somewhere, don't you?
You think you're gonna get there with a gun, but you're not! Get me?
You know why?
Because you got $1,000 bills pasted right across your eyes.
And someday you're gonna stumble and fall down in the gutter, right where the horses have been standing, right where you belong.
You got me all figured out, huh?
I've spent my life mixing with your breed and I don't like it. Get me?
You can hide behind a lot of red tape, crooked lawyers, some politicians with the "gimmes", writs of habeas corpus, witnesses that don't remember overnight, but we'll get through to you just like we got all the rest!
Oh, maybe me,
I'm different.
No, you're not!
Take your gun away and get you in a tough spot and you'll squeal, like all the other rats.
You're gonna get me, huh?
In your particular case, I'd give up a month's pay for the job.
Are you gonna see Lovo?
Yeah, right away.
Tell him to stay undercover.
I'll come up tomorrow.
Hey, what's this writ you got me out on?
Habeas corpus.
Deliver the body.
Can't hold you without booking you no matter what they think you've done.
That's a fine idea. Hey, you tell Flemming
I want lots of them.
- Hi, Boss.
- Come in, Tony. Glad to see you.
Hey, that's pretty hot.
Silk. Expensive, huh?
I see that
Epstein got to you in time.
Yeah. Nice little fellow.
He give them a writ of hocus pocus.
- Sit down.
- Thanks.
He said you stay here till the heat's off. He said...
Hey. That's pretty hot.
That's Poppy.
Hey, Poppy.
Meet Tony Camonte.
Hi.
Mmm-hmm.
How are the coppers taking it?
Oh, I didn't pay much attention.
What about the newspapers?
Yeah, I bring them along.
The News has got the best story.
Pictures of you and one of me, too.
Where did they run it, in the razor ads?
Huh? Oh, that?
That's an old business.
You'll get used to that.
I got it in the war.
War with a blond in a Brooklyn speakeasy.
Some kidder, huh?
It takes a long time with the pinchers, eh?
You've got an office for this sort of thing,
Johnny. Why don't you use it?
There you are, Tony.
That's a bonus.
Hey, that's a nice feel.
That was a fine job, Tony.
Remember, that's only chicken feed.
You've stepped into big company.
You stick to me and do what I say, play square and you'll be walking around with lace pants and a gold hat.
- You know what I mean?
- Sure, I know.
Now, listen, I'm gonna cut you in on a percentage.
Give you a raise, double.
The South Side is rolling in jack.
All we gotta do is step in and take it.
Yeah, and have some fun with O'Hara, too, huh?
Who? Now wait a minute.
O'Hara's too big a guy to buck now.
There's lots of jack on the North Side.
Now, listen, you.
You let me think up the ideas.
I'll take care of that big hop in my own way when the time comes.
I say we stay out of the North Side.
I say we leave O'Hara alone and what I say goes!
Don't ever forget that.
- You're the boss.
- That's better.
From now on, next to me, the boys take orders from you.
Yeah, me and you, eh?
That's fine talk, Boss.
Here. Have a cigar.
There'll be plenty of work for everybody.
Costillo slowed down too much.
Yeah, and now he come to a dead stop.
Here, you better smoke one of mine.
That's pretty nice.
Expensive, huh?
I don't like cigar smoke in my room. Do you mind?
Listen, I'm gonna hold off that meeting with the boys a couple of days.
After Big Louis' funeral, it's better.
You know what I mean?
Oh, yeah. Sure, sure.
It don't look so good.
And I want you to send some flowers.
A cross of white carnations from me, see?
Yeah, and I send lots of purple, a bunch.
Big Louis he always liked purple.
Why don't you go and do it now?
You better make that meeting Monday.
Tell all the guys that want to run beer on the South Side to be there.
Tell them I'm gonna make a speech.
You know what I mean?
Mmm-hmm.
Well, goodbye, Poppy.
See you again.
She don't like anybody but me.
Mmm-hmm.
She's a very busy girl.
Expensive, huh?
Here, Little Boy.
Easy dough, huh, for just standing outside and listening to a gun go off?
- Cinch. When are we gonna get some more?
- We'll get plenty.
There's business just waiting for some guy to come and run it right.
And I got ideas.
We're working for Lovo, ain't we?
Lovo? Who's Lovo?
Just some guy who's a little bit more smart than Big Louis, that's all.
Hey, that guy is soft.
I could just see it in his face.
He's got a setup, that's all, and we gotta wait.
Someday I'm gonna run the whole works.
Remember, those monkeys on the North Side ain't so soft.
Oh, yeah? Say, they're satisfied, ain't they?
Why didn't they come and take Big Louis before we did?
Listen, Little Boy, in this business, there is only one law you gotta follow to keep out of trouble.
Do it first, do it yourself and keep on doing it.
- Where's Cesca?
- Oh, I don't know. She go out.
What do you mean?
Ain't she coming home for dinner?
Hey, I don't like that!
You tell her I want she should come home for dinner. Understand?
Sure.
I tell her lots of times.
"Come home. Come home.
Tony no like."
Still she don't...
That's a nice way
I catch you, huh?
What do you mean, "catch me"?
I wasn't doing nothing.
- You was kissing him!
- Sure. What of it?
- Well, I don't like it!
- You're missing lots of fun, Tony.
Listen. I don't want anybody kissing my sister, understand?
You're hurting my arm!
I don't want anybody putting their hands on you.
- What do you think you're doing?
- I'm your brother.
You don't act it!
You act more like...
I don't know, sometimes I think...
I don't care what you think!
- You do what I say!
- Sure, and never have any fun.
"Never have any fun."
You call that fun, eh?
Running around with guys like that. That's fun!
Listen, you want real fun, huh?
Here.
How's that?
Gee, Tony, where'd you get it?
Never mind where I got it.
You just spend it, see?
You're swell.
Go on, get ready for dinner.
And remember, you do what I say.
No more fellows, understand?
What for you wanna give her money, huh?
Well, she's just a kid.
She wants to have fun.
Yeah?
Sometimes I think you crazy.
Cesca!
What for you take that money, huh?
- 'Cause I want it, that's why.
- Give it back!
It's bad money!
Tony no got it in no good way.
Gonna bring you lots of trouble.
What do I care where he gets it?
There's nothing wrong with his giving it to me.
Tony wants me to have a good time.
Oh, yes? You listen.
Tony no love you like he make you believe.
All of the time he smile on top, but what he thinks...
Oh, he's got lots of tricks!
He no give money to nobody for nothing.
He would to his sister!
Sister! Huh!
That make no difference.
To him, you're just another girl.
Someday, when he needs you, he mix you up in his business just like anyone else.
And he's gonna make you bad like him!
He can't make me do anything
I don't want to.
I'm gonna live my own life.
- I can take care of myself.
- Yeah?
All of the time
Tony say like that.
Afterwards, he no belong to me no more.
He's no good! And now you start to be just like him!
No, I'm not.
Don't worry about me.
I'll get along all right.
Hey!
That's all right, boys.
Just changing the name on the door.
Meet the new president,
Johnny Lovo.
Hi, boys.
Where's Berdini,
Zeigler, Meehan?
Anybody see them?
I did. They ain't coming.
Is that all they said?
They said you could take a flying...
Okay, okay.
Now we know where they stand.
All right, you guys, I'm making a speech.
Here it is.
Big Louis gets a wad of dough and then he gets soft.
He lets you guys come into the South Side and run beer.
Well, I'm gonna change it, see?
You can still stay in but from now on you're operating the way I say.
Are you asking us or telling us?
I'm telling you.
We're gonna get organized and I'm gonna handle the works.
It's gonna mean twice as much dough for everybody and half as much trouble.
- You got something figured out, Johnny?
- Everything.
Not being able to get it's gonna make this town thirstier than ever.
Running beer ain't a nickel game anymore.
It's a business, and I'm gonna run it like a business.
Swell! We've been cutting each other's throats long enough.
There's 3,000 saloons on the South Side.
Half a million customers, figure that out.
Add up what they're gonna lay on the line every year for drinks and nobody in charge.
So you're going to be it?
Yeah, "it." That's me!
I make my own beer and I got my own trucks.
I don't have to go into business with nobody.
- Where you going?
- Who wants to know?
You sit down here! And don't interrupt the president no more.
All right, President.
- Well, are the rest of you guys in or out?
- I'm in.
What about Meehan?
Yeah, Berdini and Zeigler?
Why, they've been selling to 700, 800 joints between them.
Yeah? Well, from now on they're out.
Those joints buy from us.
Sure. If you try to sell at one of those places,
Meehan'll turn this side of the town into a shooting gallery.
Fine! Anything he starts, we'll finish.
You guys don't have to worry.
All you gotta do is to haul beer.
Yeah? Well, who's gonna stick his neck in those joints and get the orders?
My friend, Tony Camonte.
Yeah, I'm what he call a good salesman.
Hey, I start right now to get orders, eh, Boss?
All you can get, go to it.
Hey, dope, got a pencil?
Oh, boys. I don't write.
That's one.
Come on.
Come on, Little Boy, business.
- Ever eat at home?
- Once in a while.
You get all the samples here.
Here have your beer.
Hey, what is this?
Let go of me, will you?
What do you want? Let go!
- Say, what's the big idea?
- Sit down!
- Who're you buying your beer from?
- Meehan and Berdini.
- How many barrels a day?
- Three.
He's lying, Tony, he's been taking five.
Chiseler.
Well, you're getting eight now, see?
And you're buying from us. Johnny Lovo.
- But, listen. I can't...
- Sit down.
I can't use eight barrels around here!
I get you a hunk of soap, you take a bath in it.
- What do you paying a barrel?
- Fifty!
Well, ours is 65, it's better!
You get delivery tomorrow.
What am I gonna tell
Meehan and Berdini?
We'll take care of them, don't worry.
Well, that's order number one.
Now we get plenty more.
There's a system to these things.
How many barrels did you say you wanted?
Six.
Yeah? Well, you're getting 10.
You're getting a delivery tomorrow.
There's no use arguing with this joint.
Zeigler runs it himself.
Step on it.
Hi, Boss.
Lots of garlic.
Get me some, too.
Well, how's business?
You get some more orders?
Lots of orders. They all buy from us.
All we have to do is fill them.
Yeah, it's a good idea.
You better tell Meehan and Berdini.
Oh, them fellows, they retired from business.
They what?
What've you been doing?
You remember you say all they have to do is start something, we finish it?
- Well, did you?
- About an hour ago.
- You mean...
- Hey! Hey, kid.
- Extra here!
- Come here. Hey!
- Keep the change.
- All right. Thanks.
Here you are, Boss.
There's your South Side all nailed up in a box.
All nailed up in a...
Yeah. Well, you didn't get the lid on very tight.
- What do you mean?
- Look at that.
Come on. Hey, keep this hot.
We'll be back right away.
- You can't come in here.
- Come on, get out of here.
No, it's a private hospital.
You can't go...
Oh, what did they do?
- Hi, Poppy.
- Hello.
Hey, what's all the time biting you? You afraid of me?
Well, that outfit's enough to give anybody the yips.
Nice, huh? I got three more.
Different colors.
I see you're going in for jewelry.
It's kind of effeminate, isn't it?
Huh? Yeah. I got them in an auction. A bargain.
You sure are a funny mixture,
Tony.
That's the first time you smiled.
Yeah?
Well, how do you mean, you think I'm funny?
You just are, that's all.
What else are you doing with all your money?
I hear you're getting a new car.
Mmm-hmm. It's different.
It's got bullet-proof glass and a steel body.
And I got myself a new house, too.
Come up sometime?
Yeah,
I'll bring my grandmother.
No kidding. You come up?
Why don't you get yourself a girl, Tony?
Well, I'm working on that now.
Yeah?
Well, don't tire yourself out.
- Is Johnny in?
- Yeah.
He's mad, huh?
Hi, Boss.
When are you gonna learn that I am the boss?
Sure, you're the boss.
Then what do you mean by breaking up that
Lakeview joint last night?
Didn't I tell you to stay out of the North Side?
Now, listen, Johnny, it was easy.
Now, you listen to me, stupid!
That was one of O'Hara's places and you know it.
Didn't I tell you I wasn't ready for O'Hara yet?
It was a nice little order.
Fifty barrels a week.
I don't care if it's 50 a day!
What do you use to think with, an empty beer keg?
Just when we get this territory lined up and running smooth you step out and gum up the parade.
How do you mean, Johnny? I just sell a little more beer. Don't worry.
Don't worry? You know what O'Hara's liable to do now?
He'll send his guns down here on the South Side.
They'll move around like hummingbirds.
You're liable to get it and I'm liable to get it.
I know that hop. He's tough, see?
He ain't so tough.
Hanging out in a flower shop.
You afraid of a guy like that?
I ain't afraid of anybody.
Sure, you're not.
That's a crazy question, eh, Johnny?
- Come on, don't argue.
- Where you going?
To clean up after you, you mug, unless it's too late.
Look out!
It's Keach!
Hello? Hello?
Hello?
Hello, this is Mr. Camonte's secretary.
What's the name, please?
This is
Mr. Camonte's secretary.
Secretary, I told you.
Hey, hey, hey.
Secretary, you dope.
Secretary.
Okay, Boss.
No, no. I no talking on you.
I was talking on Mr. Camonte, that's my boss.
- That's...
- Hey, hey.
Get a name. Get a name.
What's your name?
No, no, I no wanna know what's your brother's name.
I wanna know what's your name.
Oh, you do, huh?
Listen, I come on over there,
I smack you right in the teeth.
- I get you, your brother...
- Hey, what's the matter?
That's no way to talk.
Talk nice.
Tell him to state his business.
Go state your business.
Who was it?
I don't know.
What do you mean,
"I don't know"?
Didn't I tell you always to get a name and write it down over here?
- Oh, Boss, I forget again.
- Forget again.
Hey, what are you writing there, huh?
I don't know.
I can't write.
Can't write? That's nice.
A secretary that can't write.
A secretary must be able to write.
Must be educated.
Get an education.
He cannot write.
Education?
That's your fault.
This Mr. Camonte's...
Oh, no, please, you're wrong.
I no hang up on you.
I thought you was through.
I told you before.
You have to write a letter.
You have to make...
Oh, you do, huh?
Let me tell you...
Shut up, you. You...
Hey, what's the matter with you? You crazy?
Listen, the last time
I tell you...
You pick yourself a nice one.
You get one for me?
Didn't have time.
Was there any trouble?
No, it was easy.
- How many were there?
- He was alone.
Hey.
Hello? Who is it?
I don't get...
Boss, I don't get the name.
Hello? Yeah?
Who? Oh, sure.
Sure, send her right up.
That's Poppy.
Hey! It's better nobody see you with this.
Hello, handsome.
Well, Poppy.
Hello, Tony.
They tell me O'Hara was killed in his flower shop this morning.
Had you heard that?
- Did Johnny send you up here?
- Johnny?
How do you like this place?
- Kind of gaudy, isn't it?
- Ain't it though?
Glad you like it. Come here,
I show you something nice.
Steel shutters on all the windows.
My own idea.
In case you have visitors you don't like, huh?
Uh-huh. That's right.
How do you like the view here, huh?
You see that?
Someday I look at that sign and I say,
"Okay, she's mine."
You think so?
Yeah,
I got a pretty good idea.
That's pretty hot.
Expensive, eh?
Yeah, come here. I show you something what's pretty hot.
How do you like this place, huh?
Come here.
Here's some stuff I buy.
Aren't they sweet?
Huh? You like?
I'm gonna get some ties made to match.
See, what I'm gonna do is wear a shirt only once.
Then I give it right away to the laundry.
A new shirt every day.
You're just gonna drive the women mad, aren't you?
Yeah. One of them.
Meaning me, I suppose?
Feel it.
Huh? It's got inside springs.
I bought it at an auction. It's a bargain.
Go ahead, sit down. Try it.
Yeah, it's all right.
You like it?
I thought you were Johnny's friend.
Sure.
I like Johnny, but I like you more.
Excuse, Boss.
Cops is downstairs.
All right, tell them to come in and sit down. I'll be right out.
Okay.
Hey, I don't wanna be caught here. This is a mess.
It's all right.
Don't get excited. It's easy.
Oh, great. Thanks.
Hey, Poppy.
After I get through with them, I'll meet you at the restaurant at 4th Street.
- Yeah, all right.
- Hey, hey, go to the left.
Uh-huh.
- Hello, Guarino.
- Hello.
- You all alone?
- Yeah.
You're a cute fellow, coming here all by yourself.
You ain't afraid of me, huh?
No, nor 10 like you.
Come on, the Chief's waiting.
Hey, Angelo, call up Epstein and tell him that...
Hey, Little Boy, call up Epstein.
Tell him there's a kidney foot here taking me down to the Chief's office.
Tell him to come right down with habeas corpus, understand?
Hey, you know, I just hear O'Hara, he was met with a terrible accident.
- That's too bad, no?
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- Come on, come on.
So Camonte thinks he's going to run this side of town, now that he's got O'Hara.
- He's getting too big.
- Yeah?
He won't get any bigger.
We'll take him before he finds out about these guns.
Three hundred slugs a minute.
Get the rest of them unpacked.
How many we got?
Plenty.
There's a lot more coming.
O'Hara had them run in across the line last night.
We'll have the cops on our necks.
Forget it. They can't do anything about it.
There's no law against bringing guns into the state, and we can buy all we want.
- What a cinch.
- You said it.
Gaffney, listen, Camonte just left headquarters.
McGill's trailing him.
He's gonna phone.
Hey, you guys.
Load those guns.
You get the cars ready.
Stick the hearse in front of them.
Then to the South Side, and I want everybody.
- Now you hang onto that phone.
- Right.
Snap into it, now get going!
- Hello.
- Hello, Tony. Have a seat.
Hello.
Well, what took you so long?
The moxie, he was late with the habeas corpus.
Go on, order some food, will you? I'm hungry.
You know, every time I see you, you look better.
That's a cute hat.
- Please, my stockings!
- What's the matter?
Well, don't do that, Tony.
They're brand new.
- Hands off, eh?
- No, feet.
You know,
I know lots of girls.
I know redheads,
I know blonds, and all kinds.
They all like me.
Yeah, you're pretty good, eh?
I'm the best.
Are you gonna eat by any chance?
I'm not hungry.
Except for you.
You got something I like.
Yeah, I'm nice with a lot of dressing.
You work fast, don't you, Tony?
No. Say, I've been waiting a long time.
I'm crazy for you.
Everybody say,
"Tony Camonte, he's a big shot!
"He's got everything he wants."
Yeah, I got everything but what I want.
You understand?
Pardon me, telephone for Mr. Camonte.
Hey, dope, go see who it is and get a name.
Hello, this Mr. Camonte's secretary.
What's your name?
I say what's your name?
This Mr. Camonte's secretary.
You have to speak louder.
I can't hear what you say.
That's too loud!
That's too loud! Talk lower!
Hello, please.
Don't be a fool, Tony!
What's the name, please?
I can't... Hello?
Hello, please,
I can't hear what you say.
Hey, that's O'Hara's mob.
I can't hear what...
I can't hear what you say.
It's too loud.
Hey, lookit!
They got machine guns you can carry!
If I had some of them, I could run the whole works in a month.
I'll get you one in a minute.
Hey, that's swell.
Look, it's little, you can carry it!
Come on.
Let's get out of here.
Boss, there was too much noise.
I didn't get their names.
That's a dope!
Too much for him.
Bring him upstairs. Bring him upstairs.
That's all right.
The back door. The back door.
Hey, lookit.
They've been here too!
Hey, look at that. Come here.
Get me some shells, let's see if she works.
Hey, you. Call Fugatti, tell him we want three cars, right quick.
Hey, Johnny, look what I got.
You dirty murdering mug, you bumped off O'Hara!
Who, me? That's foolish.
You told me to stay out of the North Side. I stay out.
I've been home all day!
Hey, Little Boy?
Sure!
Sure!
Oh, so that's it?
I told you to lay off!
I don't hear so good sometimes.
You won't be hearing anything if you go on like this!
Look what happened to me.
They clipped me!
Lookit, Johnny, you can carry it around like a baby!
Shut up!
We gotta get organized.
This is only a starter.
They'll be back after us.
What do you mean?
We don't give them time.
We go after them.
We throw them Micks up for grabs.
Yeah? Well, when you're laying in an alley with your head blown off, maybe you'll learn how this business ought to be run!
Yeah? And who's gonna do that?
O'Hara's mob, Gaffney.
He's running it now!
He'll give it to you here, a pound of hot lead in the belly.
Make sure it's him, Johnny!
- Cars are here, boss!
- Okay. Hey, Little Boy, it's business.
You fix who goes in each car, understand?
- Hey, where do you think you're going?
- To the North Side.
- Like I always knew someday.
- You can't do that.
What do you mean "can't"?
Who's stopping me?
I am. I'm giving you orders for the last time.
There's only one thing that gets orders and gives orders!
And this is it. That's how
I got the South Side for you and that's how I'm gonna get the North Side for you.
Some little typewriter, huh?
I'm gonna write my name all over this town with big letters!
- Hey, stop him, somebody!
- Get out of my way, Johnny, I'm gonna spit!
Come on, fellows!
Hey, Tony, take this along in case that bean shooter doesn't work.
Okay!
- Come on, Dugan.
- All right.
- Hey, you see what happened here, kid?
- I don't know, mister, but they said a big black car with side curtains, and a machine gun gave them the works.
- Oh, hello, Ben.
- Hello, Chief.
What do we gonna do about them machine guns?
What can we do about them?
There's no law against manufacturing them, just against having them.
If they can't get them in one state, they go across the border and get them in another.
These fellows bootleg machine guns like they bootleg booze.
Yeah, they better do something about that because with these toys to play with, what happened before will look like a tea party.
I know it. So you better put the screws on the 22nd Street freight house.
I hear they're bringing them in in fruit boxes.
Right.
- Get that guy's number!
- Somebody get an ambulance!
What's the matter?
What is this, a pinch?
No, just bringing you a valentine.
Don't you know it's Valentine's Day?
Oh, yeah, I forgot.
Come on, line up, you guys.
Over there. All seven of you.
What's the gag?
Is the heat on?
Plenty!
Face the wall!
Put your mitts up.
All of you!
Here's Gaffney.
Gaffney, what do you know about this? Well?
Well, I was on my way here to the garage to keep an appointment.
- And I was late.
- Yeah?
And a car drives up and some guys pile out.
Two of them was cops, at least they was dressed like cops.
Cops! That's a new gag.
Then what?
Well, it looked like a pinch.
So I beat around the block till it was over, then he picked me up.
Yeah, lucky you were late.
Now, take a good peek and see what you missed.
Seven of them.
Lined up against the wall.
Mowed down, just like that!
They didn't have a chance.
Sit down, Chief, you're wearing out the carpet.
Yeah? I'm the only one left!
Thinks he'll get me, huh?
Fat chance.
Who's there?
McArthur from the Journal.
Let him in.
- Hi, Gaffney.
- How'd you find me?
Oh, we boys from the Journal always get around.
Yeah, anybody else know
I'm here?
Nope. It was just my own little idea.
Sit down.
You're going to stay for a while.
Well?
Can't get a thing on him.
We're right up a blind alley wherever we go.
And Gaffney's turned yellow, and he's hiding out.
- What about Lovo?
- Lovo is practically out.
He's as scared as Gaffney.
It's Camonte all right, but we can't prove it yet.
No, but we will.
- Say, Chief?
- What do you want?
- This fellow, Camonte.
- What about him?
A story.
Public's interested in him.
He's a colorful character.
Colorful?
What color is a crawling louse?
Say, listen, that's the attitude of too many morons in this country.
They think these big hoodlums are some sort of demigods.
What do they do about a guy like Camonte?
They sentimentalize, romance, make jokes about him.
They had some excuse for glorifying our old Western bad men.
They met in the middle of the street at high noon and waited for each other to draw.
But these things sneak up and shoot a guy in the back and then run away.
- I guess you're right, Chief.
- Colorful.
Did you read what happened the other day?
A car full of them chasing another down the street, broad daylight.
Three kiddies playing hopscotch on the sidewalk get lead poured in their little bellies.
When I think what goes on in the minds of these lice, I wanna vomit!
- Ben?
- Yeah.
See if you can find Gaffney.
He'll probably get it next.
They got all the others.
Right.
Our organizations are opposed to your policy, Mr. Garston.
Your paper could be an influence against the gangster, yet you keep right on playing up his activities as front page news.
Murders, gang wars, killings, that's all we read about!
You're glorifying the gangster by giving him all this publicity.
You're trying to tell me you can get rid of the gangster by ignoring him?
By keeping him off the front page?
That's ridiculous!
You're playing right into his hands! Show him up!
Run him out of the country!
That'll keep him off the front page.
In the meantime, you expect our children to read of nothing but outrage and murder?
That's better than their being slaughtered.
The city is full of machine guns.
Gang war in the streets.
Kids aren't even safe to go to school.
You want that to go on?
Certainly not! But what can private citizens do?
Even our police force can't stop it!
Don't blame the police!
They can't stop machine guns from being run back and forth across the state lines.
They can't enforce laws that don't exist!
Then it's up to the federal government to do something about it.
You're the government!
All of you!
Instead of trying to hide the facts, get busy and see that laws are passed that'll do some good!
For instance?
Pass a federal law that puts the gun in the same class as drugs and white slavery!
Put teeth in the Deportation Act!
These gangsters don't belong in this country.
Half of them aren't even citizens.
That's true. They bring nothing but disgrace to my people.
All right.
I'll tell you what to do.
Make laws and see that they're obeyed if we have to have martial law to do it!
The governor of New Mexico declared martial law to stop a bull fight, the governor of Oklahoma to regulate oil production.
Surely, gang rule and wholesale law defiance are more of a menace to the nation than the regulation of oil or a bull fight!
The Army will help.
So will the American Legion.
They offered their services over two years ago!
And nobody ever called on them.
Let's get wise to ourselves.
We're fighting organized murder!
That Sadie Thompson, she's a pretty smart girl.
What's a girl wanna hustle in a place like that for?
Yeah, it's raining all the time.
Yeah, that rain, that's pretty good.
That comes from a pipe, you know, just like a shower.
Them two fellows...
Hey, which one do you think she takes?
The guy with the collar?
Nah, he ain't so hot.
Hey, listen, them Marines ain't so hot, too.
Come on, I go take a smoke.
That's a fine show.
I gotta see more shows like that. You know, serious.
Ain't got no jokes.
I like a show with jokes.
That's a dope.
What more do you want?
Listen, this girl, Sadie, she's got what you call a problem.
This fellow with the collar, he's gonna...
- What's the matter?
- They found Gaffney.
Spotted him down at Frank's Bowling Alley.
He's got into a game.
- Yeah?
- It's a setup.
Take about an hour to get the boys.
I'm looking at a show now.
Listen, it's the last act now, see?
There's two fellows after a girl.
Well, she's called her name Sadie, see?
Now this girl, Sadie, she's been, what do you call, disillusioned.
We gotta do it now!
He's liable to slip us again.
He's the last one, Boss.
Come on, Tony.
That's too bad.
All right, come on.
Hey wait a minute!
Now, you stay here.
- You stay and see the show.
- Oh, Boss.
I gotta know which fellow this girl, Sadie, she take.
You stay here and find out, and then come and tell me.
It's all right, Boss.
The copper's gone.
All right. Come on.
Hey, Little Boy, you go around the back, up on the balcony, grandstand seat on Stanton.
Hey, Pietro, side door.
He may have friends, you never can tell.
Joe, I want you stand in the alley.
If he gets that far, you do your stuff.
You keep the motor running.
Bring the present. You stay here.
Come on, fellows.
Now we'll know what happened to that girl, Sadie.
Hey, Angelo, did she take the guy with the collar?
No, she climb back in the hay with the army.
Yeah? That's fine.
She's a smart girl, I think.
- Come on.
- What're you doing?
Not bad, huh?
Just watch this one.
- Hello, Tony.
- Hello.
That's pretty hot.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Hello.
Hello, stranger.
Chair. Well, Johnny.
Well, you're looking swell.
I thought we were gonna see something of you.
Well, here I am.
Where have you been?
On a vacation?
I've been working.
Up on the North Side, eh, Johnny?
That's what the papers say.
Don't work too hard.
I just finish up tonight.
Now I play a while.
You got your own table,
Camonte.
What's that?
This is a table for two.
Well, maybe you get another table, eh, Johnny?
Hey, listen, you. Who do you think...
All right, go on.
Nothing seems to bother you much, does it?
Well, I get used to noises.
- Hello, Guino.
- Hello, baby.
Why are you always high-hatting me?
Go on, beat it!
I suppose you need an organ grinder to work with?
Tony's inside.
He see you in that outfit?
I looked pretty good from two stories up.
Am I different now?
Wanna dance with me?
Listen, you're Tony's sister, see?
Besides, you're only a kid.
I'm 18.
You like that music?
Now do you wanna dance?
No.
Afraid! Afraid of Tony's sister!
Why you...
Well, I noticed you stood there and watched.
Someday you'll find out you've been missing something.
Hey, how about it?
You and me, eh?
I thought you weren't dancing?
I've changed my mind.
I need exercise.
We show them something, huh?
I think you missed me, huh?
That's right.
We make up for lost time.
How do you wanna play, Tony?
Like this?
That's good.
You wait here.
I take her home myself.
- You can't.
- Shut up!
You'll be sorry for this!
Next time I catch you in a place like that again, I'll kill you!
You're telling me what to do?
I'll do what I want, same as you. Understand?
You listen to me!
I hate you!
Never mind what I do.
That's all right!
But you're gonna stay home.
Understand?
- I'm no baby! I can take care of myself!
- Yeah.
Running around with fellows, eh?
Letting them hold you like that!
Letting them look at you! Dressing up like that for fellows to see, eh?
What I do with fellows is my business!
Cesca!
- Mama.
- Cesca. What's the matter?
What did Tony do to you, huh?
What'd he do?
He hit me. He said he'd kill me and I wasn't doing anything!
I was only dancing.
That's all right, figlia mia.
No cry. All right, tell Mama.
Come on upstairs.
No cry, baby.
He hasn't any right to.
Just because I'm his sister he can't throw me around like that.
No, no, no.
All right, no cry, baby.
I tell you.
I tell you lots of times.
He hurt you. He hurt you.
He hurt everybody.
Pour a little on those tires.
Right.
That's got him.
Just shut up!
Get me some nickels!
Get me some nickels! Hurry!
Lakeside 1305.
Get me a drink.
Hello?
Hello, is this Jim?
Tony Camonte.
Is Rinaldo there?
No, Mr. Camonte.
He left an hour ago.
- Is Lovo there?
- Lovo?
No, he left, too.
Said he was going back to the office.
Bosworth 4503.
Hello.
Hello, Mabel?
Camonte. Rinaldo there?
Why, no.
He ain't been here.
Say, you know, I think that guy's giving me the runaround.
I've had a date with him two or three times...
Maybe he's going home to bed.
What are you talking?
- That tomcat?
- Try Maizie.
Maizie, that's right,
I forgot about her.
Hatfield 6401.
Yeah, 6401.
Come on.
- Hello.
- Hello, Maizie? It's Tony Camonte.
- Rinaldo there?
- Yeah.
For you.
- Hello.
- Hello, Rinaldo.
I'm at Pietro's. Pietro's!
Yeah, come right away.
Anything wrong?
Yeah, plenty.
Go get me a towel.
I thought you weren't doing anything tonight?
I'll be back later.
This is worse than being in love with a grasshopper.
It took you a long time to get here.
- Who done it?
- I don't know.
But I got an idea.
You just wait.
- How do you stand with Lovo?
- Huh?
- Come on!
- How do you stand with Lovo?
- Who's Lovo?
- That's good.
Say when.
That's enough.
You call Johnny Lovo at his office at 10 minutes past 2:00, see?
That's 10 minutes past 2:00.
You say that you're calling from the country now, see?
You're one of the guys that took me for a ride.
The car got smashed and I got away.
The car got smashed and I got away!
Yes, yes.
You think it was Johnny?
I don't know.
But we'll find out now.
We'll be there when Pietro calls.
And if it was Johnny, he'll stall, won't he?
- Sure.
- Let's go.
Open the door.
Come on, let's go.
Hey, Tony, where you been?
What happened to you?
Yeah, look.
They spoil my brand new suit.
Who, coppers?
No, monkeys.
Never seen them before.
Somebody must have brought them in.
How did they get you?
They smashed my bus, took me for a ride.
Almost.
That's right.
You left the café alone.
You ought to know better than to do that.
Where were you?
I thought you always stuck to Tony.
Well, baby, I'm glad you got away.
I'd have missed you plenty.
I'll get somebody for this.
I knew you would, Johnny.
That's Poppy.
I don't wanna see her tonight.
I'll tell her you ain't here.
Wait a minute.
I'll talk to her.
Hello? Who?
No, there's nobody here by that name.
What? What?
Oh, ring off.
You got a wrong number.
You better have a drink, Tony.
You?
It's a lie!
I didn't do it!
I wouldn't try anything on you, Tony. We're pals.
Sure, we're pals.
No, no. I didn't do it!
You got me wrong.
Listen, Tony, I brought you out here. I worked with you.
You're the last guy in the world
I'd try to cross, you know that!
You wouldn't do anything to me!
Don't take me, Tony! Give me a chance!
You can have anything I got, anything!
All the dough you want.
Poppy! I'll let you have her!
I give you my word!
You can have Poppy, Tony! I'll tell her!
The boss!
No. Let me go away.
Give me a break.
I never did anything to anybody!
- I never hurt anybody!
- No.
You get somebody else to do it for you!
No!
Wait! Don't!
Tony, come back! Tony...
Oh, Tony.
What's happened?
Where's Johnny?
Where do you think?
Go pack your stuff.
Hey, come here.
Look at that.
Do you remember what I told you?
Tony isn't here.
He's out of town.
You're telling me?
Why did you hang up when I called yesterday?
Too busy.
The one on the end's kind of cute.
She ain't bad.
I should think you'd want something more like...
Like what?
Me.
Cut out that sort of talk.
You're only a kid.
I told you
I had grown-up ideas.
You're like Tony when you go after something, hey?
What would Tony say?
He'll be away for a month.
The big fellow's on his way from Florida.
Uh-huh.
Well, he'd better watch his step.
This town's entirely different than when he left it.
That new crowd down at the City Hall is looking for him.
The first crack he makes, they'll climb all over him.
Hand it to Hap. Tell him to play it for what it's worth.
You stay out here.
- Tony.
- Where's Cesca?
She get a place of her own.
She say to me, "Shut up. Mind your business."
Just like you say.
- Well, is she living alone?
- Yeah.
All the time that's what she tell me, but one day I follow her.
She meet a man.
They go in the house together.
I look and I see her name under the push bell.
See? See what you do?
Once I have a son,
I have a daughter and now...
Ma...
Where is the place she live?
236, Central Street.
What you gonna do? What you...
No, no, Tony, no!
Stop!
Central Street.
He was going downgrade
Making 90 miles an hour
When his whistle broke into a scream
And they found him in the wreck
With his hands on the throttle
Scalded to death by the steam
It's a mighty rough road
From Lynchburg to Danville
And the track's on the three-mile grade
It was on this road
That he lost his average
You can see what a jump he made
Hello.
Hello, baby.
I'm so happy.
You're telling me?
You do love me, don't you, Guino?
You know I do.
Never stop telling me, will you?
I'm not like all the others, am I?
You're up there all by yourself, sweetheart.
We'll always be happy, won't we?
Hello, Tony.
Tony, I...
Tony, don't! Tony!
Guino! Guino!
Guino! Guino, speak to me!
Speak to me!
Guino, say something! Guino!
Tony, he's my Guino!
I love him.
We were married yesterday,
Tony! Really married!
We were going to surprise you!
Weren't we, Guino?
Oh, darling, speak to me!
He's dead.
He's dead.
He loved me.
Really loved me.
Don't touch me!
Don't come near me!
Stay away from me!
You're not my brother!
Don't you think I know?
Murderer!
He kills people!
He kills everybody!
He kills everything!
He's a butcher.
That's what you are.
You're a butcher!
You're a butcher!
Drive down to the house.
Come on, Boss.
Go on, beat it!
Get out of here.
Come on! Come on!
Mr. Comante's secretary.
You have to speak louder.
I can't hear you.
It's... It's Poppy, Boss.
I got her name.
I didn't know.
I didn't know.
Tony, what is it?
Tony, say something.
Tony.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Oh, yeah?
He did, eh?
Did you get the rest of them?
All right, let me talk to Duffy.
All right, Ben, here's what you've been waiting for. Camonte killed Rinaldo.
Put up a fight when they tried to take him and holed up in that steel fort of his.
Get him! Take Madden and his whole outfit.
I'll send you more if you need them.
Yeah, wait a minute, Duffy.
Don't lose any men. Block off the street.
Put your lights on and smoke him out away from his guns and he'll quit!
Get going. Hello, Duffy?
Yeah. Send those monkeys on in.
Tell Jake to stay put.
Tony! Quick, Tony, they're coming!
The police!
Cesca.
They're after you!
They're gonna get you, Tony!
Why didn't you shoot,
Cesca, huh?
Why didn't you shoot?
I don't know.
Maybe it's because you're me and I'm you.
It's always been that way.
Three of you fellows, go on that roof across the street there!
You two cover that alley back of the house.
- Right.
- Right.
Tony, what are we gonna do?
What do we do?
Come here,
I show you what we do.
Tony, they followed me! This is my fault.
I shouldn't have come!
What's the difference?
Your fault, my fault?
Just so you're here, that's all what matters.
Here, you load them, huh?
Sure I'll load them. I'm not afraid.
I'm like you, Tony.
That's the way to talk. You're not afraid, huh?
Come on, we'll show them.
Here, here. Put it here, Cesca.
Put it right here.
We'll show them something.
Hey, look at the monkeys there!
They think they're gonna get
Tony Camonte, eh?
Hey, Cesca, wait, I'll show you.
Look, Cesca, see?
Steel, all steel!
Solid steel!
No one can get in here!
Hey, Cesca, you and me, huh?
We'll show them!
We'll lick them all, the North Side, the South Side!
We'll lick the whole world!
Cesca!
Cesca!
Let me lie down, Tony.
I'm all hollow inside.
Cesca. Cesca, what is it?
Where?
It doesn't hurt, really.
Just put your arms around me,
Tony, just for a minute.
- Cesca.
- I won't be able to help you now.
Oh, you can't go away. I won't let you, you understand? I won't let you!
So dizzy.
Hold me, Tony.
Don't let me get scared.
Listen, you don't understand.
I'll be here all alone!
You can't leave me here all alone!
Why, Tony, you're afraid!
Don't be afraid, Tony.
You're all I got left!
Little Boy, he's gone! Angelo, he's gone!
I'm no good without you,
Cesca. I'm no good by myself!
Cesca!
Cesca!
They're out there! They wanna get me!
They're all there!
Cesca, they won't give me a chance, please!
- Cesca!
- Guino wasn't afraid!
Cesca, don't go.
Please, Cesca!
I won't let you go!
You hear, I won't let you!
You understand?
You gotta stay here, you hear me?
I don't wanna stay!
You're afraid.
Guino. Guino.
Cesca, please. Come back, you hear?
Come back, I say!
Hurry up with that gas.
That second window up there.
All right.
Cesca! Cesca!
Cesca!
I can't see!
Cesca!
Angelo!
Little Boy!
Cesca!
I can't see!
Break it down!
Stop! Don't shoot!
Don't shoot, Guarino!
Lookit, I'm all alone.
I got no gun, see?
Give me a break, will you, Guarino?
Break? Who'd you ever give a break to?
Look at me. I got nobody.
I'm all alone!
Little Boy's gone.
Angelo is gone.
And my steel shutters, they don't work.
Shut up, Camonte!
Give me a break, will you?
Don't shoot!
You got me covered.
I can't do nothing!
I can't do nothing!
Give me a break will you?
Listen, don't shoot me!
Don't shoot me.
I told you, you'd show up this way.
Get you in a jam without a gun and you squeal like a yellow rat.
Come on! Climb into this.
<b>COMRADESHIP</b>
On March 10th, 1906 a terrible firedamp explosion following a fire which had been smouldering for 3 weeks, buried more than 1,200 miners deep down in the Courrières mines.
A team of German miners belonging to a special rescue squad came from Westphalia to join up with the French rescuers.
This film, which takes place in our time is based on that terrible catastrophe.
The two original languages have been deliberately respected in the film's dialogues in order to preserve the power and truthfulness of the remarkable images which are the basis of this movie.
- I won!
- No, I won!
- They're mine!
- No, they're mine!
Give it to me!
Too bad, the French aren't letting in any more unemployed.
But we have border passes.
Let's try anyway.
Give me my marbles back!
This is the border. Come and get them if you dare.
You think I'm scared?
- Do you always have to fight?
- He wants to take my marbles.
Make up!
No use, guys.
The unemployed can't pass.
Border's closed for the unemployed.
When you're out of work, you're not welcome anywhere.
No work. No work here.
There isn't even enough for us.
They hardly have enough work for their own people.
- The fatherland's calling.
- We must tighten our belts again.
- Look at all the coal they got.
- They still can't sell it.
Till then, no work for us.
- Good luck!
- Good luck!
Hey, something fishy is going on there.
They're afraid that the fire will break through from the French side.
How long has the heat been noticeable?
For 3 weeks. Ever since the fires on the French side started.
As long as no gas comes through...
No, there's no gas.
They build wall after wall over there, but the fire keeps chewing its way through.
No, it won't hold.
Today's Saturday.
The night shift must build another one by Monday.
No blasting here!
No gas.
No blasting for now.
We have to wait until the new wall is finished.
- Okay, got it.
Hey, fellas.
Hey, fellas!
No blasting today because of the fire.
The fire. That's all we talk about.
As long as there's no gas, it's not serious.
If there were any gas, what would happen?
Don't worry, kid. They'll use
Sunday to build another wall.
This wall must be finished first thing tomorrow morning.
Come on, guys.
Give it all you got.
We're doing what we can.
In all this heat.
Great way to spend a Sunday.
Dance Hall
Hey, guys! How about we go in, have a drink.
Three tickets.
No, three tickets, not flowers.
- Three tickets.
- Not here. Over there.
My first conquest in France.
Three tickets.
Okay, here you are.
Parasite free!
- Look, the band's up there.
- Nice.
- Waiter!
- You say "garçon" here!
Garçon.
What'll you have, gentlemen?
One, two, three... beer.
Don't forget about schnapps.
Three beer, three...
Schnapps. I speak German.
Three beer, three schnapps and some cabbage for my rabbit.
Yes, a head of cabbage for your rabbit.
- Hey there, lovebirds. Everything OK?
- Don't mind us.
Hits the spot.
I prefer Dortmunder Union beer.
Now, there's a girl.
What's French for
"Shall we dance?"
Excuse... a dance.
You dance very well, Emile.
Not as well as the Parisiens.
You think they dance like this in Paris?
Françoise, you're not leaving tomorrow, are you?
- My vacation is over.
- You promised me.
I'll come back.
You can't hold this one back.
She's a Parisien now.
Excuse. A dance?
- What does he want?
- A dance with you.
I'm not dancing anymore.
Tell him in German if you can.
Mademoiselle not dance.
"German"?
I get it. "German."
"Not with a German,'' she says.
Germans dance just as well as Frenchmen, miss.
Come.
- I won't be insulted!
- Back to your rabbit!
Forget it, pal.
- Let go. - Behave.
You're a foreigner here.
One more round?
Three beer, three schnapps?
Why didn't you want to dance?
I'm tired.
- I've had enough. I'm leaving.
- I'm staying.
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.
Good night.
German should drink German beer.
- Good night, sir.
- Good-bye.
I imagine this fire business is over. - Certainly.
With the new wall there's no more danger.
I hope it's finished by morning.
- What's he talking about?
- Nothing.
Where are they coming from?
- There's a fire in a gallery.
- A fire?
You always hear about those fires.
- How can you still be a miner?
- But Françoise... it's my job.
- I could never live like this.
- Françoise, Françoise!
Françoise!
- Morning, Jean. - Morning, Emile.
I'll be right back.
Morning, Emile.
Did you sleep well?
Thanks, Mom.
Good-bye.
Here, Mama.
The luggage is ready.
Well...
Good-bye, Jean.
What time's your train?
Right now. I'm already late.
Well, good-bye, Françoise.
Good-bye.
Come on. Why do you have to go? Stay with us.
It's a real shame.
Hopeless.
Well, have a nice trip.
Emile is a good man.
He's a good worker...
And reliable.
Yes.
- Well, my boy, you going down today?
- Of course, Grandfather.
Good-bye.
Say, Jean, what's going on?
All Sunday, all he could talk about was gas and fire and...
We've got no orders to stay home.
Emile, look after the kid.
- Don't worry. I'll be his nanny.
- Thanks.
- You dying to come along?
- Those were the good old days.
Mother, why don't you all come to Paris?
Jean would surely find work there.
Many have gone to Paris.
They earn more but not enough for the rent.
Besides, we've always been miners in our family.
Nice reason.
We've already lost Dad.
Jean's all we've got left.
I'll never marry a miner.
No, Mother.
Never.
- You done? Is it strong enough?
- Yeah.
Okay.
- Fire in the hole!
- Beware! Beware!
Fire!
Fire! Fire!
Guys, let's clear out!
There's gas. Let's go.
Fire.
- Fire!
- There's gas.
- Georges, here.
- Don't be afraid!
Fire! Fire!
- Good-bye, Mama.
- Good-bye.
The mine!
Let me go!
I want to get off!
- What's the matter, Marie?
- The big mine's on fire!
The big mine?
The Thibault mine?
- The Tribaut mine's on fire again.
- The Thibault mine? -Yes.
- What is it? An accident?
- The mine's on fire!
My little Georges.
- What's the matter?
- An explosion.
An accident.
A gas explosion.
Look. It's burning over on the French side.
It must be awful over there.
The mine. - The fire!
Our husbands are down there.
Let us in!
Hey! What are you doing?
You're not allowed in here!
Quick. Go get the mechanics.
What's the matter?
What are we waiting for?
The elevator's not working.
What the hell are you doing?
Don't get in the way.
Careful now.
Keep it taught.
It's 2,000 feet (600m) down.
- Let us in!
- You know that's not allowed.
- Tell us what's happening.
- Come on, keep calm.
- The elevator's broken.
- What?
The elevator's broken.
They can't go down.
We want to know what's going on.
Where are our husbands?
Georges, quick!
Georges, Georges!
Miss, your bag!
Have you heard? A bad accident on the French side.
I know. Six hundred and nine are trapped.
What do you want? An accident like that is nobody's fault.
Well... This damned drudgery will kill us all.
- All the rushing around.
- And then what?
We supposed to go on welfare?
What did you say?
Yes. I heard it from the foreman.
Poor devils.
Hey, you think they have enough rescue gear? - Why should I care?
They have more money than we do.
We have to go over there.
- Good luck.
- Don't leave just yet.
What do you want? - You're a member of the rescue squad, aren't you?
- You crazy? Not the French.
- Think they'd get us out?
- We know the French.
- Since the occupation of the Ruhr.
Come on, guys. Why should we mind the generals?
A miner's a miner.
You think the French will pay your pension if something happens to you?
And the ones buries down there?
Don't they have wives and children?
Think of your own wife first.
Think I'm gonna suck up to the French?
Wait until it's you down there one day and nobody comes to help you.
You'll be crying out for your mother.
- Come to think of it...
- Am I right or not?
- Of course he's right.
- If we only new...
- Anton, you coming?
- As long as you are.
- You too?
- Do not worry. I'm in.
- Let's go, miners.
- Get the rescue squad ready.
- And you, Fritz? You coming too?
- Of course.
Let's go then.
You're all completely nuts.
Chickens don't need to come along.
We're lucky that the connections to the French side are well sealed off.
Otherwise, the gas would've reached our side in no time.
This is a heavy blow for the French.
They'll be busy with that for a long time.
Come on, Foreman.
Bring out the rescue gear.
Be reasonable, Wittkopp.
That's impossible.
- You know the situation over there.
- There are miners trapped.
- I must ask management.
- They won't be against it.
Give us the key.
There's no time to lose.
What's going on here?
Director, the rescue squad wants to go help the French.
What do you want?
We want the rescue equipment.
- Who's he?
- Wittkopp from Level Seven.
We're volunteering for the rescue work.
You think they need you?
There are never enough rescue workers.
Listen, it just occured to me.
Actually, we really are the closest.
Our men can get there much faster than the French teams.
- What if something happens here?
- We'll have the midday shift.
Yes, that's true.
How you even gonna get across the border?
Just let us worry about that.
Pit foreman.
Distribute the equipment.
You take charge. - Yes, sir.
Get ready, miners.
We're getting the equipment.
Hey, the guys from the early shift are going over to the French.
The French? The ones who threw us out yesterday?
- What's that got to do with it?
- Come on. We going in or not?
Yes, Sergeant.
Ready? - Ready.
Good luck! - Good luck!
Get me Director Berteux on the line.
- The French director is on the line.
- Thanks.
Hello? Mr. Berteux?
Hello, Mr. Berteux.
Mr. Berteux, our rescue teams have just left.
Not at all, sir.
It's only natural.
We're only too happy to help.
Good luck. - Good luck.
Come back soon.
Gustav, you haven't eaten yet.
Thanks, Mother.
- Make sure nothing happens to you.
- We'll be back.
Anna...
Half the miners are buried over there.
We have to go.
They also have wives and children.
Don't cry, Anna.
You must understand.
Sister, please take me to the Thibaut mine.
Do you have a relative in the mine?
Your husband?
No, my brother and... his friend.
Georges!
Georges!
See you soon, old boy.
Good luck!
Georges!
When I was a little boy, a similar accident happened nearby.
The elevator got jammed. So they had to spend a half a day on repairs to get the miners out.
German rescue team.
Think the French will let them pass?
Hey, Girard. Get the phone.
FRENCH CUSTOMS
If they start their passport nonsense, we'll lose valuable time.
Don't stop!
Speed up. Come on.
Watch out!
The fool's shooting!
Hey!
Hey, don't shoot! Let them go.
It's a German rescue team.
Yes, two trucks with German rescuers.
Okay, thank you. That's good.
Let me know as soon as you hear from the rescuers.
Look, there's the flag.
Mom. - Françoise.
What about Jean?
The rescue workers are at the bottom. There's still hope.
It's Albert!
Rose, it's your husband.
- Albert, Albert! - Please, ma'am.
From the other side.
Albert... answer me.
Can you hear me?
You were with Jean?
With Emile?
Please, answer me.
All...
All down there.
All dead.
It's not true. If he's alive... the others are alive too.
We must rescue them.
Let's force the gate!
Yes!
Be patient. The rescuers are still working.
- Liar! You're letting them die.
- No. I assure you.
- They want to save the mine!
- But not our husbands!
Take the flag down.
They're not dead.
Open up! Open up!
Call the supervisor.
The troops must be alerted.
You hear that?
He's asking for the troops.
They're going to start shooting.
Here they come.
- German rescue team. Open the gate.
- Open up.
- Open up! German rescuers.
- What? The Germans?
They're German rescuers.
They're coming to help us.
- Open the gates.
- Open up!
The Germans.
I don't believe it.
Rescue squad from the German mine, at your disposal.
We thank you and your brave companions for coming to help rescue our comrades.
We hope that none of you are hurt in your efforts.
Good luck!
- Think they made it over there?
- Wittkopp will get it done.
- If we didn't have to work...
- Too bad. It's a shame.
- We could've met them halfway.
- Eat your lunch.
Yes.
Lunchtime.
Hey, he's taking off.
Let us in on it. I'm sick and tired of your secrets.
Good luck.
- He's nuts. Where's he going?
- No clue.
Kasper. Hey Kasper!
We can't let him go alone.
Kasper! Kasper!
Hey, don't run like that.
We can't keep up.
Look here. This goes to the French side.
During the war, they broke through here.
In other words, it's our mine. Get it?
- Are you crazy?
- If anyone hears about this, we'll get fired on the spot.
You can stay if you like, dearest.
- The French don't like you anyway.
- Oh, the French.
I really shouldn't go over there.
France insulted me.
But I'll show them.
I'll tell 'em in German.
German rescue squad.
Thank you for your help.
What kind of birdcage is this?
Border... "Border, 1919"
Have you ever seen such a thing?
It goes 2,000 feet (800m) up from here to the surface.
Only you can't see it up there.
Like I said: ''The French have something against me.''
They won't let us in.
To hell with them!
- Those guys are in for a surprise.
- Hit hard. Show them.
Tell me, Jean...
How many...
How many truckloads today?
Emile, my friend.
And Françoise?
Has she gone?
One, two...
- You know the way, right?
- Don't worry.
This leads home to mommy.
Wow.
What a mess.
Hey. Here's one.
There's another one over there.
He's had it.
Ah, it's Bijou.
Hey, go straight ahead here.
Let's follow the horse.
He knows the way.
Hurry up. We're not getting any air down here.
Well, boy. Let's see where you've led us.
- He doesn't understand German.
- Don't say that.
Sometimes horses like this are smarter than people.
Then let's find out what he likes about this spot.
Hey, it's the ghost of the mine!
It's an old miner.
You're right.
Look - it's Georges.
It's my grandson.
I'm the one who found him.
What? - Yes.
-Yes, yes.
What's wrong with the young one?
Hey, half-pint.
Get back!
Crap.
Now we can't get out.
Well, now we're done for.
Tighten this.
Come right back.
Hello?
Hello! Is someone there?
Is someone there?
The Germans.
Come on!
Come on, fellas! Fire!
Open up on them!
Up there... Two more.
Pass the kid through.
The air's a lot better in here.
Careful!
- Don't worry, fella.
- We'll take good care of you.
It's nothing.
They hire pretty young boys.
Hey, you didn't find anyone?
Anyone missing from the rescue teams?
No, everyone's here.
Your guys all above ground?
- Are any of our men still below?
- No, they've all come up.
Everyone's up.
So, stuck?
Not... Not get out?
Then we'll take this railcar to heaven.
Hello? Hello?
I can keep searching but they're all dead down there.
Look down under there.
Nothing here.
Maybe over there in the corner.
There it is.
Huh? Yes!
Five men trapped in the railcar room.
What? Germans? Where?
Five men trapped in the railcar room.
Yes. Yes.
Five men! Railcar room!
Yes, yes.
- There are five more.
- There are five more!
Hey there! There are still five men in the railcar room, tunnel 8.
- They just telephoned.
- Hear that?
- Five more down there.
- Get up, guys!
Five men down there.
We must search for them.
- What the heck is going on?
- There are still people down there.
Move it!
Let's wait another 5 minutes.
Then we'll see.
Hello, gentlemen. I'm told you were waiting for me.
Please excuse me.
I just found out five men are trapped alive in the railcar room.
A rescue team has already gone down for them.
Here they are.
Yes, that's them.
Georges, my Georges.
They're here for us!
Yes, they're coming!
They're coming.
Thank God. What can I say?
We were as good as dead.
Right, Kasper?
Then Kasper said:
''If I only had an awl.
An awl would be damn nice.''
What I have done well?
So what do you think I did?
I went to the phone and said:
''Director, sir, could you please send an awl to our funeral?''
Here they come!
Come down, my boy!
Wanted to go in first?
Grandfather, there you are.
Go ahead, Jean.
Say something to them.
My friends, we're all united as miners. And it's because we're all united as miners that you brought me up from the bottom.
And again, it's because we're united as miners, that comrade Kasper broke the gate in shaft 1315.
And it's also because on our side of the border we have only two enemies: the gas and the war.
Bravo! Bravo!
We must never forget that we're all united as miners.
Thank you, my comrades.
We say not farewell but good-bye.
My comrades!
The exact words our French comrade said, I don't understand.
But what he meant, we all understood.
Regardless of whether we're German or French we're all workers.
And a miner is a miner.
But why do we stick together when it gets tough?
Should we sit idly by until they've stirred up so we shoot each other down in war?
The coal belongs to everyone.
Whether we dig it up on this side or the other.
And if they can't reach an agreement at the top we'll stick together.
Because we belong together.
Long live our French comrades.
Good luck!
Good luck!
Everything back in order.
Everything must always be in order.
Okay, this should hold it.
- Have you completed the report?
- Yes.
Here.
<b>THE END</b>
It's adorable.
I'll take it.
I'm glad you like it.
It's the latest model.
- Can you deliver it right away?
- Right away, Madame.
It's my husband's birthday and I want to surprise him.
I understand.
And the address, please?
1127 Walnut Avenue.
- Pardon me, Mr. postman.
- Yes, sir?
Could you tell me where 1127 Walnut Avenue is?
- 1127 Walnut Avenue?
- Yes, sir.
That's the house up there, right on top of the stoop.
That's the house up there, right on top of the stoop.
Steady, Susie.
Just a moment!
This requires a little thought.
Now, easy down on my back.
Get off of my back!
Why don't you be careful?
Come on!
Now "Hi-ho"!
- Would you gentlemen please let me pass?
- Why, certainly, Ma'am. Just a moment.
Just a moment, maybe I can help you.
Of all the dumb things!
- And not only that, he kicked me.
- He kicked you?
Yes, officer, right in the middle of my daily duties.
Oh, he kicked you, did he?
- Hey, you!
- What?
Come here!
Go down and see what he wants.
You go down and see what he wants.
Don't argue with me, go to see what that man wants!
- I don't argue...
- Go ahead!
- What do you want?
- Go down and see what he wants!
What?
I don't want you.
I want that other monkey.
- What?
- He doesn't want me.
He wants the other monkey.
You!
Say, what do you mean by molesting that girl?
- Who, me?
- Yes, you.
- Why, I was just...
- Now let that be a lesson to you.
Are you going to stand for that?
Say listen, if he'd have said one more word to me, I would've...
Now let that be another lesson.
Say listen, don't you think you're bounding over your step?
What do you mean 'bounding over my step'?
Why, he means overstepping your bounds.
Now let that be a lesson to you!
Well? Either of you two numbskulls going to take this thing out of the way?
- What's it to you?
- I should like to pass.
- Why don't you walk around?
- Walk around?
Me, professor Theodore Von Schwarzenhoffen?
M.D., A.D, D.D.S, F.L.D, F.F.F and F, should walk around?
Get that thing out of my way!
Get out of my way!
Come on, get out of my way!
Very lovely.
I will have you arrested for this!
I will have you thrown in jail!
I'm professor T.D.A...
- Ollie.
- What?
I can't make it.
Don't weaken now! We need to do only a few more steps. Now push together.
Come here!
You've carried that piano for all those steps?
You didn't have to do that.
Yuo see that road down there?
All you...
All you had to do was to drive around that road to get up here.
Why didn't we take that before?
Just a moment.
I guess we'll have to take it back.
- Why?
- There's nobody home.
Where there is a will, there is a way
We'll take the piano through the window, carry down the stairs and place in the living room.
You'll find a ladder and
I'll get the block and tackle.
Why don't you watch what you're doing?
Hey, Ollie.
- What?
- There's somebody home.
- Are they up there?
- No, I heard them coming up the stairs.
You heard them coming up...
Why stupid, that was me!
- That was you?
- Why, certainly.
Well, how'd you get in the house?
I was standing on the ladder while you were pulling the piano up and the block and t...
Get back in there!
Throw me my hat!
You heard them coming up the stairs...
- What is it now?
- You've got my hat.
Here!
Throw me mine.
Now get back in the house and
I don't wanna hear anymore out of you!
Where did you get that hat?
Now let's get this piano downstairs.
Get that piano out of there, while I'll find a place to put it.
I'll get it out.
Get out of here and get that piano out of that box!
- What were you doing up there?
- I was trying to plug it in.
That's not the place to plug it in!
Give it to me!
- If I'll see him, I'll run him in.
- Thank you, officer.
Now lets' get that place clean!
What is the meaning of this?!
- Do you live here?
- Do I live here?
This is my home.
What are you doing here?
- We've just delivered your piano.
- Piano?
Piano?
I hate and detest pianos!
They are mechanical blunderbusses.
Take it out of here before I commit murder.
Take it out!
Take it out!
That's enough!
Wait a minute. I'll take care of you.
I'll take care of you!
Theodore, what are you doing?
Why, these two idiots delivered a piano here by mistake.
- Look at our home!
- It wasn't a mistake, darling.
I've bought a piano to surprise you,
 on your birthday.
I wouldn't have this happened for a million dollars.
I thought you said you hated pianos.
What, me hate pianos?
But I'm nuts about them!
Excuse me, gentlemen.
What can I do to show you how sorry I am?
Just sign here.
Service with a smile.
Stanley, the pen.
Why you!
Out of my house!
Wildebeest again.
I think we've seen about a million today.
Look, dear.
Poor darling hasn't even learned how to use his precious eyes.
Rhino.
What a spot for a hunter.
We'll be a hunter someday.
Right now we're too sleepy.
That's a baby.
Cape Town this time tomorrow.
Cape Town and mines and shares and people bowing and scraping.
But we wish we were never going to get there.
Don't say that.
- Superstitious?
- No, of course not.
Then forget about Cape Town and being
Lord Greystoke's favorite nephew.
- Let's enjoy ourselves while we can.
- All right.
Oh, dear, it's waked him.
I'll see if anything can be done about it.
- Is everything all right?
- Just rough air, Mr. Lancing.
This escarpment we're over is not on our map.
Our compass isn't behaving well, either.
- How do you account for it?
- I can't. All this is quite strange to me.
I'll try to get a radio bearing.
These air currents seem to be modeled on a dish of spaghetti.
The radio is dead.
I can't find anything wrong with it, either.
Doesn't that starboard motor sound funny to you?
Yes. Get back in your seat.
Fasten the safety belts, and I'll try to find an open space.
We're losing altitude, dear.
Hand me that blanket quickly.
We'll put him over with us.
Cheetah.
Stop now.
Tarzan, what on earth are you doing?
Why, it's a baby.
- Where did you get it?
- Cheetah find.
One just doesn't find babies in the jungle.
His parents must be frantic.
There, there, now.
- Jane will look after you.
- Jane want?
Want him?
Tarzan, you better go find those poor people.
- Eat first.
- That's right.
Where will we get him some milk?
I guess coconuts will have to do.
Hurry, Tarzan.
The poor little thing's hungry.
Tarzan eat now.
Tarzan, you go get those coconuts at once.
- Baby eat first?
- Yes, of course.
There we are.
First, we'll have a nice warm bath... and then we'll have supper.
And tomorrow, I'll take you back safe and sound to your father and mother... and I won't be a bit surprised if I just hate to give you up.
Hurry, Cheetah.
Careful, now.
Thank you, Cheetah.
I don't know what I'd do without you.
There.
We have your real mother to thank... for bringing so many of these wonderful things on the plane.
And look, she even marked these with your initials. R.L.
I wonder what that stands for.
I don't suppose we'll ever know.
One day, I'll take you out in the jungle, and we'll pick some flowers... and I'll show you the place where Tarzan laid her down to sleep.
At least we can be grateful when those savages found the plane... they didn't disturb her.
Poor dear. How she must have loved you.
Cheetah, stop it.
Now see that you turn on the charm...
because I don't think Tarzan approves of strange young men.
Tarzan, how clever.
Now say, "Thank you, Father."
- "Thank you, Father."
- Tarzan.
Isn't he adorable?
Tarzan, would you watch him for a minute?
- Watch?
- I have something to do in the kitchen.
Would you hold his bottle and see he doesn't choke?
Him no choke.
What is it, Tarzan?
Look, he knows you already.
- He's laughing at you.
- Baby hold.
- That's right. Hold him, baby.
- Baby strong.
Tarzan, he's been with us more than a week now.
- We've got to find him a name.
- Name?
Yes, like Tarzan, Jane, and Cheetah.
Baby's got to have a name, too.
If the Zambeles hadn't taken those men out of the plane... we might have found a clue to his real name.
Baby strong. Call Elephant.
Elephant, with a little nose like that?
Later call Elephant. Now call Boy.
- But that's not a name.
- Boy.
After all, I am his mother.
Tarzan, father. Call Boy.
Then go to your father, Boy.
And later on, he'll teach you all the things you ever need to know in the jungle.
Then look out, all you lions and tigers... and snakes and crocodiles and cannibals out there in the jungle.
The King has a son!
Boy, use both hands.
Tarzan, make him come down.
He'll break his neck.
Tarzan learn when boy.
Neck all right. Boy all right.
I'm always worrying about something, aren't I?
You know, before Boy came...
I used to worry that one day you mightn't come home.
Jane home, Tarzan come home.
I suppose just being perfectly happy makes me afraid.
She's wounded.
Guns. White people.
Where's she going?
She's going a long way to the elephants' graveyard.
- And she's leaving her baby here with us.
- Who'll take care of him?
Perhaps our Timba will adopt the poor little thing.
Remember she lost her baby in the river last year?
Leave him alone, darling.
You can play with him when he gets to know you a little bit better.
Boy, were you bitten?
- Boy all right.
- Now that he's growing up...
something like this seems to happen every time we take our eyes off him.
There's never a moment
I'm not afraid for him.
Tarzan, this life's all right for you.
Certainly it's all right for me, but for a child...
What's the matter?
Take Boy home.
Come on, Boy.
What was that?
Whatever it was, our friends, the Gabonis, have had enough.
- What was that, Mr. Sande?
- I think that was Tarzan.
Tarzan? What's Tarzan?
We better check our position with the photographs, Sir Thomas.
Never can tell when the Gabonis will get their nerve back again.
These pictures match the country, don't you think, Sande?
According to this, the plane's almost directly above there... on top of the escarpment.
We can take a look.
Camp here, Mooloo.
Hang on. Is this Tarzan a white man or a white ape?
He's white, at any rate.
According to Holt... he's absolute master of this whole escarpment.
All right.
They won't charge if we leave them alone.
What's that?
That's just an okapi, Mrs. Lancing.
Okapi? Never heard of it.
A very rare animal.
The old-time hunters used to think it was a cross between a giraffe and a zebra.
Looks it, too, in a way.
What is it, Mooloo?
- They found the plane!
- Come on.
No question it's their plane.
- Is there any...
- Not a trace. Clean as a whistle.
You certainly do what you undertake.
You brought us right to the place.
So all we need now is an affidavit from Mr. Sande here... to the effect that we've discharged our obligation.
Then we can go home and live in style for ever after.
It's my belief they survived the crash.
Otherwise, there'd be some sort of trace.
But if they were alive... surely we'd have had some word from them in the past five years.
Isn't it possible they're being held somewhere?
- Held?
- Yes, captive in some native juju hut.
- Magic and all that.
- It's most unlikely.
- But isn't it possible?
- Yes, it's possible, of course.
Then we'll go on searching as long as there's the least hope.
If only one of them is alive, we'll take that one back to England... no matter who tries to stand in our way.
Boys see tree devil, bwana.
Tarzan.
Looks like a warning against trespassing.
Which means that if we keep on... we're certain to meet the one person who may have definite news for us.
- We must look for him at once.
- No, don't take your guns.
How did your friend Holt say we make contact?
Tarzan makes contact himself when he's ready.
Good day, sir.
I suppose we ought to explain our intrusion.
- Go!
- Who are you?
Tarzan. Go!
But look here, we came all this way to find some white people...
- That's enough of that.
- Steady.
This is a precaution of my own.
Tarzan, wait!
- What's the matter?
- People.
Tell this creature he can't treat us like this.
My husband has learned not to trust guns.
- Your husband?
- Yes.
Yours?
Perhaps we should introduce ourselves.
We're from London.
I'm Austin Lancing, Mrs. Lancing... my uncle, Sir Thomas, and Mr. Sande, in charge of the party.
Hello.
No. These people are from my home.
Shall we go to my house and eat?
We don't want to put you to any trouble.
Nonsense. Of course we do.
We're famished.
Then you can tell me all about London.
We go.
I hope she won't give us ostriches to eat.
Nothing as elaborate as all that,
Mrs. Lancing.
I'm afraid at such short notice, there'll be nothing but fruit.
Evidently, one's ears become acute out here.
Nothing compared to Tarzan's, of course.
Mr. Sande's told us about your husband's marvelous instincts:
Like a wild animal.
- I didn't exactly say that, Mr. Lancing.
- Don't apologize, Mr. Sande.
Tarzan and I have a high opinion of wild animals and their habits.
I haven't often gone against Tarzan's instincts.
When I have, I've been wrong.
Get in. It's quite safe.
What a charming way to live.
Here we are.
- I say, all the conveniences.
- Yes, by George.
- Mother.
- Hello, darling.
- Your son?
- What a dear little fellow.
- What's his name?
- We call him Boy.
That's not his real name?
Say, "How do you do?" Go on.
- Cat's got his tongue.
- Hello, Boy.
- How do you do?
- That's right.
No cats up here.
No, nothing but lions. I know.
- Shall we go in now and get lunch?
- Splendid.
- Will you excuse me?
- Why, certainly.
Sit.
- Eat.
- Thank you.
Delicious. What's the name of these things?
Food.
You know what they're called, young man?
- Food.
- Dreadful savages, aren't they?
Eat.
I think I'll see if I can be of any help in the kitchen.
Something I can do?
You could get me an egg. They're in there.
- Just one apiece?
- I think one will be enough.
Thank you.
You must get pretty good hunting up here.
Lions with a jackknife, that's sport.
My dear boy, have your breakfast before Tarzan eats you raw.
Cheetah, turn on the fan.
I'm afraid your husband feels we're intruding.
- Not really.
- There's no real harm in us.
- Merely a search party.
- Search party?
But there hasn't been a safari here in years.
It wasn't a safari exactly.
The Richard Lancings were flying to Cape Town.
As a matter of fact, it's five years since they disappeared.
A while ago, we found their cracked-up plane outside of our camp.
They're inquiring about some friends, Tarzan.
You say they were relatives of yours?
Yes, the man was a second cousin.
A nephew of the late Earl of Greystoke.
I may say a favorite nephew.
Am I to understand that you have some news of our relations?
Tarzan, will you take Boy for his swim?
I don't think he can be interested in this.
Please, Tarzan.
- Come, Boy, swim.
- Swim.
Well?
They and their pilot never reached Cape Town.
Oh, my dear.
When we got to the plane... we found evidence that the natives had been there before us.
- The Gabonis?
- No.
There's another savage tribe up here on the escarpment... the Zambeles, off to the southwest.
It's their custom to use their male victims in a horrible sort of magic.
Tarzan and I found the girl and we buried her where she's safe.
But the men were gone.
I understand why you didn't wish to speak of it before the boy.
I suppose we'll be starting back tomorrow.
All right. How about getting past the Gabonis?
I'll put you on a way...
that won't take you through the Gaboni country.
That's very obliging of you.
Our cousins had a child with them.
We buried the child with his mother.
Our entire family will be very grateful to you.
I can show you the grave now, if you'd like.
Thank you. Whenever it's convenient.
We shall be about here for a day or two.
- Wouldn't you like to see it now?
- Yes, why not?
Might I say goodbye to Boy and Tarzan before I go?
Please, not today.
He's been so difficult and not behaving.
- Shall we start?
- Yes.
Poor young Richard's wife.
Everything to live for:
Youth, health, wealth.
A splendid young husband and a little son.
- It was a son?
- A son?
I believe so.
What a future that child would have had.
My brother Neville's will left everything in trust for 20 years to come.
Not a penny for the next of kin until
Richard has been definitely proven dead.
Which explains our touching family interest here.
Sir Thomas makes this sound too sordid, my dear.
Naturally we'd have given anything to have found them alive.
We'll never forget what you've done here.
We owe you and your husband more than we can repay.
Roughly €1 million, split three ways.
Oh, then it's all right, then.
I'm so glad. I mean, that we were able to do what we did.
I'll come to your camp at dawn tomorrow and put you on your way, just as I said.
- Goodbye, my dear.
- Goodbye and thank you.
- My love to the boy.
- Goodbye.
Well, we're rich.
Uncle Tom doesn't seem especially thrilled.
Under the circumstances,
I'm sure you'll forgive me for not gloating.
We'd better start packing for tomorrow.
Coming, Uncle Tom?
No. I think I'll stop here for a pipe or two.
Really, he's becoming more and more impossible.
What harm?
Boy, no!
Boy, no!
Tarzan say no.
Look out, Boy.
Boy bad.
Don't be a silly ass.
Just a gift for the boy.
Tell him it's from the old gentleman.
I wish that awful thing would stop.
No dinner, thank you.
Have the boys ready at dawn, and no thorns in their feet.
We shan't be leaving here tomorrow.
- I beg your pardon.
- That boy...
Eyes I seem to have looked into before.
Even the shape of Richard Lancing's chin.
What are you talking about?
You know what I'm talking about.
That child's your second cousin.
And, by George, my grandnephew.
No, it can't be possible.
Austin, you knew it all along.
Yes, and Sande knows it, too.
Don't you, Sande?
I really don't see how it concerns me.
There's an established custom in dealing with those matters.
Established custom?
If it's ivory the party's after... the hunter in charge usually gets
10% of whatever they bring out.
Very well.
I suppose we'll have to let it go at that.
You can count on me, then.
Perhaps I don't quite follow.
We're all going to keep absolutely mum.
The boy will never know who he is or how we robbed him.
Blood doesn't mean much to you, does it, Austin?
I'm not rich enough to afford sentimentality.
Supposing I consent to all this... and supposing even that Mr. Sande...
doesn't one day take it in his head to blackmail you... what if some other party should get up here and stumble over your secret?
It's confounded risky, but we got to face it.
But, darling, there needn't be any risk if we bring the boy back with us.
Bring the boy with us?
Are you out of your mind?
Don't you see?
If we're his legal guardians... won't we administer everything?
Of course that Tarzan brute will fight.
Perhaps she may listen to reason.
We'll surround the place in the morning, then go in with guns.
Maybe we'll catch him asleep.
There's one thing you both seemed to have overlooked.
At the guardianship proceedings...
I shall testify that your intentions are not only unsympathetic... to my grandnephew's best interests, but hostile to them.
Downright dangerous.
- Is that quite final?
- Not quite.
I'm going to have a little chat with Tarzan.
Yes, Mr. Lancing?
Sir Thomas seems to be in for a bout of fever.
I'm afraid we'll have to confine him to his tent.
Post two of your best boys... to see that he doesn't slip out during his delirium.
I suppose, Austin, there's a cad in every family.
Obviously you're ours.
I'm for bed.
I'm exhausted, too.
We need the men at dawn.
We're taking the little fellow at sunrise.
- They'll be ready.
- All right.
Good night.
What the deuce is the matter here?
Boy say white devil come back.
Boy say two devils.
Where's my gun?
- Tent.
- Idiot, I just looked there.
Someone was in my tent.
What's my camera doing there?
Look, the plate's been exposed.
Come on. It might've picked up something.
That boy saw the devil all right.
He's cleverer than you are, Austin.
He knew you wanted the boy before you knew it yourself.
If he thinks we're beaten as he's got the guns... he'll find he's too clever for his own good.
Look.
Watch Sir Thomas.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Aren't you ready?
I believe you know we can't possibly start.
Why? Did something happen?
Stop, please.
You sent him here last night.
Tarzan was here?
Not a gun left. He stole every one of them.
Tarzan stole your guns?
He wanted to make sure we'd be helpless...
when we came to ask you to give up the boy.
Then he must have known all the time.
Perhaps now we can start being honest with each other.
Where is Sir Thomas?
He's ill. He's got a touch of fever.
I'm sorry.
I think we need him badly just now.
My dear, I know your heart must be breaking.
Why should it be?
When Tarzan and I took Boy out of the jungle... we gave him life as truly as though we'd been his real parents.
He's ours.
Your legal rights can't touch us up here.
We aren't going to give him up.
My dear, I hope it isn't a question of anybody's legal rights.
It's the boy's rights we must all think of now.
Certainly. We're putting aside our selfish interest in all this.
Do you want him to grow up a jungle savage?
In England, he'll be educated to the responsibilities of his great position.
You don't want to stand in the little chap's way.
When he's old enough, he can decide that for himself.
How can he decide about something he's never seen?
Aren't you forgetting that every hour out here, he's in dreadful danger.
Tarzan's here. He watches over us.
Can Tarzan guard against fever?
There isn't a hospital or a doctor within 1,000 miles.
We'll love him just as you do.
And when he gets used to his new life, we'll bring him here for a visit.
Let me think.
Go!
Give us our guns back and we will go.
He says he's thrown the guns in Garuva Grotto.
Come.
Ropes will get us down.
No, under those falls the water's 50 feet deep.
Nobody can get them now.
Tarzan will get them for you.
No.
Go!
No, Tarzan, these are Boy's people.
Tarzan father. Jane mother.
People want Boy.
Go!
You can't expect us to go with nothing to defend us. It's murder.
Go!
That's Boy, and he's in trouble.
Look out!
Boy, darling, are you hurt?
- Is he all right?
- Just a few scratches and bruises.
- Sande, get that first-aid kit.
- Boy all right.
- Sande, get the safari boys.
- No, please wait.
Give me a little time.
Come on.
She seems to be convinced.
She may be. What about him?
Suppose we leave that to her for the present.
Such a tired little boy.
And I don't wonder.
Good night.
They were right, you know.
Right?
We've got to let them take him.
If we love Boy... we've got to let him go.
- Jane, stop!
- I won't stop. I've got to say this.
I know what it's like back there.
You have no way of imagining the things that civilization can give him.
Things we never could give him here.
And he'll be safe, Tarzan. Safe.
Oh, darling.
Help me to give him up.
Sleep now.
Is there nothing I can say or do that'll change your mind?
If I ask you to do it because you love me?
No. Boy stay.
Jane, sleep.
I've been thinking and thinking.
It would be like taking their lives if we send them back without their guns.
- Give them back to them, Tarzan.
- People take Boy.
I've thought about that, too.
We'll go now while they're still asleep... and in the morning, when they find their guns... you and I and Boy will be gone.
And they'll never find us, and they'll go away.
- Boy stay here?
- Of course.
Give them their guns, Tarzan.
Tarzan get guns.
We'd better hurry.
It's almost dawn. The birds are awake.
Go.
Your knife.
Come.
Tarzan, I know you'll never forgive me, but I'll be back for you.
Then, if you want to send me away, I'll go.
Good as new.
Lucky they were well-greased.
- Is he still down there?
- Just as she told us.
Not making any attempt to get out?
He doesn't seem to be moving at all.
Just the same, I wouldn't trust him.
Funny, I've seen trapped animals take it just like that.
Sorry this was necessary.
Not at all.
I've been quite comfortable.
Understand, Uncle Tom.
Any heroics now will put me in a very awkward position.
She's made the decision.
What more have I to say?
Why, hello, Boy.
We appreciate that this is very difficult for you.
- Can we start now?
- Yes.
- Get the boys ready, Sande.
- All right.
Mother, where are we going?
Mr. And Mrs. Lancing are going to take you on a lovely long trip.
Won't that be fun?
But where's Tarzan?
He'll be coming soon.
There's Sir Thomas.
Looking very well, too.
Quite well, thank you, under the circumstances.
You will look after the boy, won't you?
I couldn't let him go under any other circumstances.
Send him home, darling.
All right, Sande, we're starting. Look alive.
The route seems plain enough.
It branches further on.
Don't turn. You don't know I'm here.
My poor girl, you've done a mad thing.
Boy's in the worst possible hands.
Be careful, for heaven's sake.
They're watching.
My nephew and his wife only want Boy's fortune.
There's nothing now they'll stop at.
Tarzan has to be set free.
I'm going to make a run for it.
They're watching every move you make.
I'll try to drop back.
All right.
Stop where you are.
You've killed him.
I didn't bargain for this.
You're in this as deep as we are.
Mother, I want to go home.
Yes, darling. We're going back.
Come, dear.
This is the right way. Come on.
The right way back to Tarzan?
Not that he worries us, now we got our guns.
This looks like the trail.
Why don't we keep straight on?
But that way goes through the Zambele country.
- Zambeles, huh?
- Yes, I told you about them.
They're the tribe that took
Boy's father's body from the plane.
- Can't you see she's lying?
- Come on.
I'm telling you the truth.
- You can't go that way.
- Come on.
- Come here.
- Leave him alone.
Ouch! The little beast bit me.
What are you doing to him?
Darling, did they hurt you?
For his own sake, you better control that brat.
Come on.
Come on, darling.
What's that?
That used to be a full-grown man.
Perhaps we'd better turn back.
We haven't got a minute to lose.
Get the men started.
- The Zambeles.
- Run for it.
We have no chance.
Let them take the guns.
No, you can't.
Don't move, anybody. Just keep calm.
Tell him I want to speak to his chief.
Come, bwana.
Don't you worry, Mother.
I won't let them hurt you.
Boy, listen.
If you were out there in the jungle...
could you find your way back to Tarzan?
Of course I could.
It's further than you've ever gone alone.
How can I get out, Mother?
Look.
You think you could get through there?
If he can, I can.
- Tarzan will be so proud of you.
- No, it's better if we all stick together.
Boy's getting out of this place now.
He hasn't got a chance.
He'll have his chance.
Now, Boy, listen carefully.
- Next time you hear that shout, be ready.
- Yes.
And you're not to stop for anything until you're far away in the jungle.
And more than anything else, don't look back.
No matter what you hear.
Don't you worry, Mother.
Tarzan and I'll come back to get you.
Yes, darling, I know.
Yes, Mother?
- Will you promise me something?
- Yes.
Will you promise me that as long as you live... you'll never forget... forget the things that Tarzan has taught you?
No, I won't forget.
And when you see Tarzan, tell him that...
Tell him from me...
I expect when he sees you, there won't be any need to tell him anything at all.
- Are you ready, Boy?
- Ready, Mother.
Remember what I told you:
Fast as you can and don't look back.
Go.
Clean away. Did you see him?
Just like Tarzan.
Before I go, please listen.
I know now how right you are.
Boy belongs here with you.
Don't ever let him go.
Go now.
Please try to forgive me.
Later on, you'll know that I...
Jane not go.
Jane not die.
Jane all right?
Yes, darling.
Everything's all right now.
There they are:
Refugees from Anshan, or what used to be Anshan before General Yang rode through it.
And who is
General Yang?
Why, he's the warlord of this province, and a swell guy to do business with.
But why does he want to destroy his own towns?
Oh, because they refuse to pay their taxes.
Well, I should think those people would learn how to obey the law, rather than suffer this.
Ah, these people have no nerves, no feelings.
They're used to suffering.
But they can't get used to paying.
Excuse me, Madam.
You got a match,
Colonel?
No,
I don't smoke.
Colonel.
Refuse me a match, will you?
But I haven't a match.
And those people didn't have the pennies to pay General Yang.
Think it over.
He's cute.
What is his name?
Sam.
How does he keep cool in this hot weather?
Room 26.
Stay there, Sam.
I bring you greetings from Mr. Wu, General Pen.
I'm O'Hara.
Oh, Mr. O'Hara.
You startled me at first.
I didn't expect him to send a foreigner.
Well, he thought I'd have a better chance of getting through.
Mr. Wu is very wise.
With his help, we will rid the province of Yang and his locusts.
Riding through,
I didn't see much left for Yang to plunder.
The bark on trees, perhaps.
And that is why he has made so many short, desperate raids the past months.
His ordinary soldiers are deserting by the dozens for the lack of rice.
His ammunition is so little, it is distributed chiefly among his personal guard.
Dear O'Hara, this is the time we have waited for.
Here is the money.
Mr. Wu gave you instructions?
To the "T."
To which, allow me to add,
I am ashamed to say,
"Be careful."
Not only for the love we bear you, but for the sake of that money, and the guns it will buy.
I'll get through.
It is of my opinion that
General Yang would sacrifice half his personal guard for that belt.
Which is to say, he would give his arms and legs for it.
You don't advise the train from Pengwa?
No.
Wait for the plane in Pengwa.
It will be arranged.
Good.
And even there,
General Yang has special agents.
So be careful and only by plane.
Mr. O'Hara.
From the time you close that door, until the time you deliver that money to Mr. Wu in Shanghai, the fate of the people of this entire province is in your hands.
I'll get through.
Must be a very careful job.
I can do it.
Why all the secrecy?
'Cause the man O'Hara is here in Pengwa.
General Yang says-
I know.
I've done those jobs for him before, all kinds.
General Yang knows he can trust me.
Your shot, Judy.
Your daughter has beautiful form,
Mr. Perrie.
Don't worry about her.
I got it all straight, see, so you don't need to worry.
I'm to get this O'Hara on a train, and then leave the rest to you.
He's got something
General Yang wants, huh?
Yes.
Money for an opposite side with which to buy guns.
For this reason, care must be exercised.
Also for the reason the General himself needs guns badly.
Hmm.
O'Hara by any chance a cock-eyed fellow?
No. American.
Staying at your hotel.
I'll point him out to you later.
Well, you know, it won't be easy to get a man like that on a train when he wants to go by plane.
A beautiful woman does it very easy.
She's high-spirited, don't worry.
Wait for me,
I'll be back.
I'll wait.
Now, Judy.
Judy.
Please, Judy.
No. No. No!
All right.
I'm not luring men to their death on trains, a man I never saw.
Judy.
Open this for me, will you?
What good are these pills?
I don't know.
Someone said they were good.
Who?
Someone.
I can't remember.
I've had so many doctors.
This is no place for us,
China.
Isn't it, Pete?
A man ought to die at home, a Christian death.
L- I've waited months for a chance to make enough to leave.
Now it's possible.
Oh, please don't come back to that again.
If you'll help, it's possible.
Well, maybe it doesn't mean much to you.
You never saw America.
But if I have six months to live-
You want to live it there.
New York. Nyack.
L- I'd get a house on the hill looking over the river.
Oh, it means so much, it does.
L- I want to sit there.
There's boats.
They go up and down the river.
You can't do this to me, Judy.
You're me, my kid.
It's six months, then you're free.
You can do what you want then, but help me now.
Oh, what's the use?
You've been playing me for a sucker for as many years as I'm old.
Will you do it?
Sure.
Sure, I will.
Why not?
Don't feel like that,
Judy.
I don't feel any way at all. I...
Just leave me alone, will you?
Maybe someday there will be a law to abolish the blues.
Something big, like an amendment to the Constitution.
For all of us.
O'Hara is now on the train, from the other side.
Can you beat it?
He's afraid.
Don't blame him.
Goodbye.
He's on.
Any cigarettes?
Be careful,
Judy.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Yang's stopping the train at 8:00.
See you after then.
See you tomorrow.
Boo.
He remembers me.
Did you expect me?
What are you doing hiding behind doors?
I live here till tomorrow.
Do you mind?
I don't mind.
Do you like me,
Judy?
I wish you hadn't come.
Do you?
Like you?
Yes.
It's comfortable.
"Cozy," said the spider to the fly.
Preparations?
Lots of things on the ground don't like me.
For instance?
Well, uh...
There are certain busy Lizzies who scoot around taking potshots.
At you?
Mmm-hmm.
But the train's moving.
Sure, the train's moving, and it's nighttime and we're alone.
And I like the lady and she likes me.
Judy, you've got me by the throat, and I'm telling you, whether it's dopey or not.
Judy.
Don't do that.
No?
You don't want to do that.
That's what you say.
What do you think of that,
Sam?
Come on.
You know, Judy, uh,
I'm not one of the anxious boys.
You're a good guy.
I can wait.
Wanna hear something funny?
I'm crazy for a laugh.
I'm scared. Afraid.
Because of me?
Yes.
Well, I'm a man of infinite patience.
Sure.
You have a whole lifetime ahead.
It was only the mail.
Why are you so jumpy?
I told you, lots of things on the ground don't like me.
Why do they make those attempts on your life?
A certain honorable tootsie roll named Yang thinks he has the right to control the lives of tens of thousands of poor Chinese.
How?
Military dictatorship.
Taxes.
You put, he takes.
You protest, he shoots.
A heartbreaker, a strike breaker, a head breaker.
Altogether a four-star rat.
And what do the poor ones say?
Me. That's where I come in.
They're preparing underground.
They need good guns and ammunition.
You'll sell to them?
And, naturally, your Yang doesn't care for that?
You uttered a profound mouthful, lady.
Why do you risk your life, O'Hara?
What do you get for it?
Money? Fun?
Here's my life in a few lines:
Ran away from an orphan asylum at 14.
Sold newspapers on the street and got pretty good at ducking blows.
A life of opposition, you'd call it.
Then I boxed for a living, you know.
Didn't like smacking other kids around, so I quit.
Dock walloper for a year, road construction, then I joined an aviation outfit.
A bunch of us came over here in '29 to fly planes, and some of the fellows are still flyin' planes and dropping bombs on the same people
I'm working for.
You ask me why I'm for oppressed people?
Because I've got a background of oppression myself, and O'Haras and elephants don't forget.
What's better work for an American than helping fight for democracy? Do you know?
No, I don't.
But do you believe all that?
That's like asking do I believe I'm alive.
I hope to spit, I believe it.
If I believed like that in anything,
I'd do a dance.
Why do you look at me like that?
Can't I look?
Can't I kiss you?
Ask my mother.
Mrs. Perrie, may I kiss your daughter, huh?
Thank you.
What did she say?
She said it's okay.
Very soon, Herr General.
Isn't that marvelous?
They're playing hooky from a padded cell.
Look at him.
You're full of jokes, aren't you?
Why not? I don't meet a good girl in 10 years, and you expect me to be dumb.
So eat your cabbage and don't stick pins in papa.
Dinner and hurry it.
Quiet, Sam.
Are you hungry?
Not very.
You're pretty delicate.
Waiter.
Oh, hello, O'Hara.
Hello.
Who's that?
A Shanghai journalist.
Writes on an
English-speaking paper.
You can buy him for a bag of salt.
How you been?
Fine.
Chiseler.
What's the time?
My watch has stopped.
Ten minutes to 8:00.
Can I tell you something?
Something I can write down in my diary?
Why won't you be serious?
Why? What for?
The Lord made the world in six days, and on the seventh...
Oh-oh. The moles are working underground.
Don't go out there.
Why not?
You're in trouble.
Am I?
They're waiting.
Who is?
I say, do you know what it is?
Cloudburst.
I'm a newspaperman,
General Yang.
With newspapermen, me all the time gentle.
Caught yourself a public enemy, huh?
That's a fact.
Very bad man, et cetera.
Mind if I tell our readers?
No, I don't mind.
Also print my picture?
Sure.
Front page stuff.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Nice friends you got.
Don't blame me for this, young man.
I'm a plain passenger on the train.
Sorry what they're doing to you.
Awful, but don't blame me.
Good, I won't have to remember your face.
Come on, Sam.
Greetings.
Breath purifier?
Thanks. I have got a bad taste in my mouth.
What's on your mind,
Yang?
General Yang.
General Yang, Sam.
Very sweet.
Aw!
Sad.
Mr. O'Hara, you are a big bother on me.
Looks pretty black for you from where I sit, Yang.
Real opposition begins.
The old days are through.
For my money, sweetheart, you're sitting on a porcupine.
Mr. Buddha.
That's a fact.
That's the only way they ever leave me.
They do shameful thing, lose face, then kill self.
Someday even they'll get wise, your fanatics, and cut you down like the rice is reaped.
Huh!
My guards faithful.
Stay with General Yang until each one himself becomes General, and I biggest General of all 12 provinces.
Yang Incorporated, merchants of war with 12 dummy partners, huh?
I don't like you to interfere.
Why you help my enemy, hmm?
I'd do anything I could to give you a kick in the pants.
To my jaundiced eye, you're a social disease.
I don't like your disposition,
I don't like your friends,
I don't like your politics, and I don't like your hat.
Your faithful dozen may stick to you, but you're still a small noise at the end of a parade.
Mr. O'Hara seems so little interested in his life.
You'd take chances, too.
I have a great destiny.
So have I, but mine is tied up with millions of people.
Yours is tied up with yourself, and the power of machine guns.
Your belief is in your own very limited self.
Mine is in people.
One day, they will all walk on earth, straight, proud.
Men, not animals, with no fear of hunger or poverty.
That's not so bad to die for, sweetheart.
The time has come when even, even peasants dare to laugh in the face of officer and General.
Pal, my nose bleeds for you.
Give me the money.
Couldn't Wong find it?
He's saying no money in your place.
Cough up, Sam.
Give me the money.
The eight characters of destiny are against you.
No money tonight.
Eight characters say you are a liar.
Come and get it.
Fight?
Give me.
All right.
This is the money.
You don't have to worry an iota.
I'll take it right to him.
Uh, Brighton.
That's his name?
Yes,
Brighton.
He is waiting at the Mansion House,
Shanghai.
And
B- R-l-G-H-T-O-N.
Now I got it all in my head, every word of it.
No mistake?
Oh!
General Yang never forgets mistakes.
Say, am I honest or am I not?
After all,
I...
I keep Mr. O'Hara for now.
Maybe his Shanghai friends make trouble, et cetera, maybe.
You're a running dog.
Thanks.
Very good man.
Teaches my men discipline and how to make war.
We will float down the river to Shanghai together, me and O'Hara.
Pick up ammunition also together.
Two days from now, we arrive.
If Mr. O'Hara's friends make trouble, if I don't get ammunition,
Mr. O'Hara don't arrive.
No hummingbird can fight 15 wolves,
Mr. O'Hara.
Now, was that so terrible as you thought?
The Mansion House.
Mr. Brighton.
Mr. Brighton.
Paging Mr. Brighton.
Paging Mr. Brighton.
Paging Mr. Brighton.
Paging Mr. Brighton.
Paging Mr. Brighton.
"I'll be glad when you're dead, you rascal you"
"I'll be glad when you're dead, you rascal you"
Paging Mr. Brighton.
Paging Mr. Brighton.
Paging Mr. Brighton.
I'm Mr. Brighton.
Thank you.
No news?
No.
I am very worried.
Something is very wrong.
Drink hearty, my friend.
Oh, no, you don't.
You can't get away with that.
I won't even drink this drink.
You're trying to get me drunk, so I'll wait here for your man O'Hara.
But I won't.
Now, look here, Woozy.
Don't you know
I can't lay around this harbor with that load of guns?
Any minute, the gitchie-witchies are liable to hop on us and we're sunk.
What do you think
I'm doin'?
Waitin' till the kids get out of school to sell them lollipops and pretzels?
No, it's munitions.
It's illegal.
Plenty guns.
Plenty bullets.
Plenty noise.
And you, none of your philosophical remarks.
Get me, Chennie?
Is he comin' or not?
No philosophy.
Have a drink, my friend.
Oh! Take the wax out of your ears.
Don't you hear me?
You can't get me tight.
Mr. Brighton, it is no such intention in my mind.
But we are expecting an information from Mr. O'Hara this morning.
What was in that wire you got?
Oh! Smart, very smart.
Well, you get six more hours and then I sell to the first comer.
That's what was in that wire.
Get me?
Got you.
You forget the glass.
Oh.
I'll be under that moose head and a stuffier piece of stuffin' I've never seen.
"I'll be glad when you're dead"
"You rascal you"
"I'll be glad when you're dead"
"you rascal you"
Detestable man.
Who is it?
Don't know.
Thank you.
Pete.
What?
Where are you going?
I'll be back.
Where are you going?
Down to the bar... for a tonic.
No more bets on the ponies?
Now, Judy, have I got money for bets?
I don't know.
Have you?
I surely don't understand your attitude.
Pick up that shipment for Yang, first thing.
Of course. Of course.
Of course. Why, of course.
Well, I must say, what a funny world where a man's own daughter don't trust him. I must say.
No one mistrusts you, Pete, but I just happen to be worried about that O'Hara boy.
So please be careful.
Sure.
Oh, you dog.
Oh, you dog, you.
What are you looking at, banjo eyes?
He drink for three days now.
Who is he?
Name Mr. Brighton.
Oh! Mr. Brighton?
Yeah.
Waiting for somebody.
He got plenty money.
Say he go to hard-knock university.
Every morning, he eats two double lamb chops.
Also has two sisters live in Washington, D.C.
His favorite song:
"I'll be glad when you die, you rascal you"
"I'll be glad"
"When you're dead, you rascal you"
See?
I found this sign on the floor, Mademoiselle.
Thank you.
My foot.
I am Wu, Mademoiselle.
And?
I bring to Mademoiselle the greetings of the house.
A custom here.
Good brandy?
Yes.
Our four-star is better.
Brandied duck is with us a house specialty.
I never eat brandied duck.
Very friendly on the stomach.
Like our small creature here.
You have him long?
Two years.
Call him.
What?
Mademoiselle, call the animal to you.
What for?
Call him.
Maybe if you call him with name.
Maybe if you say to him,
"Sam."
What do you want?
Where is O'Hara?
Who is O'Hara?
Mademoiselle, you are indelicate.
You do not know him, nor the creature here?
Your Mr. O'Hara was taken off a train last night.
General Yang do it?
Yes.
What else?
I don't know what else.
What do you mean?
You don't know more?
No.
The animal was left behind.
You're sure nothing more? Please.
Why should I lie?
Mademoiselle has already lied once.
Who in the world are you to demand the truth?
A great friend of O'Hara.
And what's that got to do with me?
Shanghai is filled with dangerous persons,
Mademoiselle.
Be careful.
Of what? Do you-
You will be watched.
You like to fish?
It bores me.
Why are you so very much interested in my country, my, uh, people?
How many times before you buy guns for people of my province?
Maybe I fix you so you really don't talk.
Interesting idea, no?
Yang, that money was the bitterly earned personal property of 500,000 oppressed people who want your heel off their collective neck.
They trusted me with it, and I failed.
If I live to ever look them in the face, it will be with far greater difficulty than facing you.
Do I make myself clear?
No.
I'm saying, bring on your fires and your devils.
You've already done all you can to me, or I've done it myself.
Mr. O'Hara has so little regard for his life.
He sounds, sounds almost like Chinese.
That makes me a candidate for your guard, don't it?
No. You are too much interested in women.
That's a fact.
You eat fresh fish tonight.
Thanks.
When we arrive in Shanghai tomorrow, maybe fresh fish eat you.
Hmm, thanks.
When does she sail?
Midnight tomorrow.
I'd like to book two bedrooms and a sitting room.
Two bedrooms and-
It's for me and my daughter.
Oh, yes, Mr...
Uh, Martin. Martin.
Mr. Martin.
Peter Martin.
Peter Martin.
I'll pay you now, cash.
How much is it?
Was the name Martin, did you say?
Yes, Martin,
Peter Martin.
Midnight tomorrow,
Mr. Martin.
Seems everybody in these parts have two names.
Have they?
That one is either a thief or a liar.
Really?
He gave a fake name.
I've seen it by the initials on his wallet.
How are you on pears?
24 hours more, and still no news.
I shall lose my mind waiting.
The boy must be dead.
Has the girl made any moves?
In 24 hours, nothing suspicious.
"I'll be glad"
"When you're dead, you rascal you"
"I'll be glad when you're dead, you rascal you"
Believe me,
Mr. Chen, it's lucky if more complications do not set in.
Oh, where are you coming from?
Down the bar, having a drink.
Down the bar? Why?
What's the matter?
Headache.
Oh.
You've been looking awfully worried these last 24 hours.
Well, knock on wood, huh.
Everything's shipshape.
We'll be out of here by midnight.
We're on our way, huh?
What's that for?
Shh.
Who's that?
I don't know.
A fat man.
How did he get here?
He sneaked in, looked through your bags.
Better open up, brother. Who are you?
I was inside when he came.
He didn't see me.
I can make an awful racket, maybe break down the door.
You wouldn't like that disturbance, would you?
Better call the police, Pete.
No, no!
Open up.
Judy, don't get excited.
Judy?
What's the matter?
Nothing, nothing.
We don't know who he is and-
Where's your gun?
In my bag.
Stand back.
Come out of there.
Put down your popgun.
Who are you?
I'm the angle man.
W- what?
When you're in trouble,
I work out the angles.
We'll find an angle,
Brother Perrie, and, uh, Miss Perrie,
I might add.
And what's all that supposed to mean?
Well, from the General to the specific, you're on a very interesting project.
No one here knows what you're talking about.
Now you get out.
We'll have the police on you in 10 seconds.
Get out.
Now, I'm not the smartest man in the world, brother, but I'm not the dumbest.
You send for the police.
Yes, you do that little thing.
Well, what are you gonna do?
Judy, this man's a big imposter of some sort, a- a faker...
He's gonna share some money with me.
What money?
That's what
I came to find out.
Oh, come on, get out of here.
You admit you don't know what you're talking about.
But your father, he knows.
Just look at him.
He needs a friend.
A bird's-eye-view man like me that knows the town, all the back alleys.
Get out!
You have it in your power to stop me from leaving,
Brother Perrie.
Pete?
One final word,
Brother Perrie.
If you were thinking of escaping with a large sum of money, and you know you are, it'd be absolutely fatal not to insure yourself with a man like me.
Oh, excuse me,
I forgot to introduce myself.
The name is Leach.
And I want one-third of it.
I shall be downstairs in the bar.
And I shan't consider it an imposition if you should call on me when you need me.
Judy-
I don't want one trembling word out of you, not one.
All I want to know is what you're doing with those Yang funds?
Shh.
Don't duck, Pete, answer my question.
You can't frighten me.
I won't give it up. Not a cent.
You'll have to. I'm not gonna let the O'Hara boy get killed.
I don't care if he does. Here are the tickets.
We're going to the States.
You mean you are.
I'll get there.
In a coffin.
Judy, help me, please.
Not this year.
Judy, don't you see, it's for you.
I can't use all this money-
Oh, stop that.
Think about buying what you want-
Are you picking up that shipment or not?
Are you?
No.
What are you going to do?
Get out of my way.
You won't tell anyone?
Won't I?
No. Because that would be patricide.
Killing your own father.
You couldn't do it, Judy.
But you're murdering O'Hara.
You can do that.
It doesn't mean the slightest, dumbest thing to you that I haven't slept for two nights because of him.
Oh, it's nice to talk about "patricide" and "poor father," but that
I'm crazy about the boy doesn't make you wink an eye.
Do you care about him or me?
Do you care about me a nickel's worth?
Where are you going?
I don't know.
Will you tell him?
I might.
You wouldn't dare.
Maybe you're wrong.
Or right.
If I were the heroine of a novel,
I'd know what to do.
Pull a plane out of one sleeve, a fat checkbook out of the other, get the Marines, and put the situation well in hand.
But this is a simple girl, my lovey-dovey Pete, one of the nameless legion that always gets stuck.
Yes, your black-hearted daughter is up a dead-end street.
Useless, dumb.
But if you laugh at him or me, I'll
I'll have your life.
Take it with my own hands.
The General say you go.
Do you want to die?
Show me how to get out of here.
Ah.
Mademoiselle plays a very nice game.
May I join you, Mademoiselle?
Certainly.
Come along.
I regret,
Mademoiselle.
Really, really?
What is it?
I feel like a bag of broken glass.
Chen.
It's not serious.
I will do it myself.
Get some hot water, some iodine, some bandages.
His clothes are in my rooms.
Well, you may as well start from the beginning.
What happened?
And that's the story in a nutshell.
I am sorry, Mr. O'Hara, for everyone.
We can never trust you again.
I don't expect it.
You were lonely, huh?
Yeah, if you want to put it that way.
In our cause, my friend, there must be a minimum of loneliness and a maximum of care.
Well, what next?
Next is to find the girl.
I'll find her and give her the works.
What is the good, to give the works?
She knows who
Yang's agent is.
Mmm-hmm. Well.
I'll grab her and make her cough up.
We'll have to work fast.
Yang won't waste a minute now he's here.
One thing is in our favor.
Yang's agent has not yet contacted Mr. Brighton.
No?
No.
He has private plans, it seems.
No, he...
It's that dame.
Huh? Well, maybe you're right.
There was some guy, some little guy.
Shanghai's a big town.
I don't know where to start looking for her or him.
I suppose you'll kill her if you see her or him.
In half.
Huh.
Mr. Chen?
I think maybe we will soon have that money again.
Hey.
What are you trying to pull?
O'Hara's here.
Calm yourself, calm yourself, my friend.
I think maybe we soon fix everything.
Lay down, Sam.
I know it's not my right to say it, but I'm glad you're alive.
Save your breath because anything you say goes in one ear and out the other.
What are you going to do?
You make the recommendation, you're so talented.
You started to beat me up.
You might continue where you left off.
I might kill you, that's a possibility.
Yes, it is.
First,
I want some information.
Answer precisely and to the point.
Who employed you? Yang?
Yes.
When they took the belt off me, they gave it to a man.
Who was he?
L- I don't know.
A little fellow with a gray face, sick-looking. I don't know.
Don't waste my time,
I'm warning you.
I'll tell you whatever I can.
And don't give me that whiskbroom stuff.
Brushing me off.
Is it necessary to shout?
Where's the dough?
Listen, lady, you can be broken in little pieces.
Little pieces, very easy.
What's funny?
You think I care, but I don't.
That's what's so funny,
Mr. O'Hara.
I could kill myself for almost next to nothing.
Try carbon monoxide.
They say it's pretty good.
O'Hara, O'Hara, you're such a fool.
Sit down.
And this is the girl I loved with vitamins A, B, and C.
Why are you so hard like that?
Where's the money?
I wouldn't tell you if I knew.
You can't intimidate me.
This is Shanghai, a public hotel.
You were doing illegal work, running guns. You fell.
You were so busy giving me a rah-rah talk, you couldn't see before your nose.
You want to speak to me, speak as a person or not at all.
Not at all is good enough for me.
There's no money here.
I didn't ask you.
The pig they made this out of was luckier than you're gonna be before I get through.
You gotta listen to me.
I want the cash.
I had nothing to do with it.
You didn't get me on the train?
Against my will.
Let me explain.
I know. You're working a brother through school.
Please, if-
Or an old, sick father needs care.
Let me tell you, dreamboat, don't think
I fell for you.
A tree with a flower on.
I'd have fallen for that, the way I felt.
A fish on a dish would have gotten me.
You don't have to justify yourself.
You think you're pretty smart, don't you?
I'm sorry you won't listen.
You're licked.
The money isn't here,
Mr. O'Hara.
Your gun won't help, and your brawn won't help.
And your big mouth won't help.
When I'm finished here, we'll talk about places where it might be.
Unless Yang gets here before we're clear.
He's at anchor, three miles out, personally.
He is?
I speak good English.
O'Hara, the money isn't there.
Where is it?
Is Yang here?
Where do you suppose
I came from, the sky?
Are you being tricky?
You heard Yang say he'd pick up the shipment himself.
Suppose you got that money, most of it, what would you do?
Would you let the person go who had the money?
Maybe.
And give him a bonus?
This is no bargain counter.
It is for you.
I'd have to ask.
Who?
Wu.
Then do it.
A $1,000 or $2,000 bonus.
You mean it?
I mean it.
Who's in there?
Where?
Behind that door.
I don't know.
But if I were behind it,
I'd keep it locked.
Don't you come in here.
Pete!
Stay out, now.
Wait!
Stay out, I tell you!
Who is he?
My father.
He's dead.
Get your hand fixed.
I'm sorry.
He's Yang's agent.
I'll have to get my belt.
You'll get your money.
I'll get it now.
Get out.
Please get out.
I'm sorry.
What must I do to ask you to leave me alone with this tired old man?
Do you want me to call the police?
No, even if you could.
Do you want me to scream and be heard?
I must get my belt.
Try your room.
I'm not sorry for him.
He took a job.
He knew what it involved.
I'm sorry you had to get into this mess.
I said it before.
You can't do this kind of work and die in bed.
It was my life or his.
It's got me nuts, too.
I like people too much to shoot, but it's a dark year and a hard night.
Come on.
I'll have to take whatever he's carrying.
Don't make me go in that room.
All right.
You stay here and have your sorrow out alone.
Hello.
Looks like you, uh, murdered a man, brother.
Miss Perrie, take his gun from him.
Miss Perrie, take his gun.
All right.
Now throw it on the bed.
That's right.
Now, may I recommend care,
Mr. O'Hara?
Look before you leap.
And you, too,
Miss Perrie.
I may be fat, but I'm agile.
Now may I recommend our next move?
Evidently, you may.
Tut-tut-tut-tut-tut.
The money isn't on our dear dead brother.
Now, every impulse of my carnal nature says to stay here and continue the search.
But every impulse of my intellectual nature says to move the luggage and all out of the approaching
Yang's wrath.
Am I, uh, understood?
Well, do it.
Oh, no, no, no.
You do it.
Mr. Wu. Call him.
Hello.
Ask Mr. Wu to come up.
Take a seat.
And you, too.
Not so good.
Better luck next time.
Don't try it again.
Now, sit down where you were.
Don't move.
Fatso was sucking around for a little nectar.
No time to waste.
Did you find anything?
The girl knows where it is.
Who is he?
Her father.
You kill him?
Yeah.
Watch him.
Bring the body here.
Fats will help.
Now, you stay here with Miss Perrie.
And you come with me, my freelance friend.
But perfect, positive quiet.
You hear me,
Fats?
I hear.
I will come back.
I was holding the fort,
General, but they nailed me down.
Yes? Who are you?
I heard they was going to rob you, so l-
Very nice.
Find Mr. Brighton.
Bring him here.
Gentle.
O'Hara!
He's got another one there.
Where is
Mr. Perrie?
Miss Perrie, where is Mr. Perrie?
Dead. Killed.
In there.
Man who killed Perrie, take money.
Give me.
Don't talk? Nobody?
I leave my men here to search, and we, all good friends, go on my boat.
Maybe then somebody talk what this is all about.
Take baggage, too.
It looks like
I'm the original boy that took the watch apart and couldn't put it together again.
He don't shake hands no more.
Example of what sometimes happens.
My man Wong here, uh, uh...
Expert.
Yes.
Very expert.
Can make painfulness many, many ways.
See?
Big chop, little chop.
And person die very slow.
Your friend Mr. Chen die too fast.
So you don't forget?
Hmm?
Now, which dog hide bone?
Miss Perrie, perhaps.
Now you tell me where is the hiding place?
I don't know,
General Yang.
That's the plain honest truth.
My man Wong, expert.
Expert.
She told you 50 times, she don't- Shh.
Shush your Aunt Susie.
The water around here is jammed with gunboats.
And you'll have one on your tail any minute.
Optimist.
Yes.
Optimist, O'Hara.
Got fog. Got night.
But there will be a day.
Oh, plenty day, but you'll never see it.
You, you, and you, you all die because destiny don't fail me.
I looted 12 cities, killed many thousands, make great commerce:
Silk, rice, and opium.
Got big, great friends.
I am Yang.
Would somebody please be good enough to hide
Mr. Chen's face?
Let's put him up there.
Well?
Do you want me to tell Yang, or will you?
Tell him what?
Where the money is.
Do you know?
Lady, this is no time for games.
But I don't know and that's the blank, flat, honest truth.
Didn't you tell me in your room at the hotel you'd make a deal?
Didn't you tell me that...
You certainly knew where it was then.
I thought my father had it on him.
That's the truth?
That's the truth, and may I be permitted to exercise the prerogative of the outsider?
Now, may l-
May I make a suggestion before he wakes up?
Sure, but if you're gonna suggest chocolate,
I prefer vanilla.
This is how
I see it.
A girl is good for nothing, and she knows it.
The only bright spot in her life she can remember is when she once won a prize in school.
That's all right because it only involves the girl's life.
But then she begins to get good people in trouble, perfect strangers, like you're in trouble now, and Mr. Wu.
It sounds like the speech that got you that prize.
Well, I don't care.
Even if
I got off this boat,
I don't know where
I'd go or what I'd do.
I've got a good, solid chunk of anguish in me as it is.
Why don't I tell Yang
I know where the money is and that I'll tell if he lets you off the boat, and Mr. Wu.
You would do that?
Why not?
It won't cost me anything, as the saying goes.
Except your delicate little life.
Who's that a loss to?
Me, myself, and I?
Don't be a fool.
Don't you be a fool.
Let her do it, O'Hara.
Do you want this girl to kill herself?
She got us here, didn't she?
You think Yang will fall for that stuff?
He might.
Otherwise, it's finished.
I'll call him.
O'Hara!
This young lady is about to present a lie to Your Excellency.
She's going to tell you she knows where the money is and reveal its hiding place if you will release her comrades.
You make decide?
Yes, and it's no lie.
But you'll have to release
Mr. Wu and O'Hara before I tell you.
I don't care what you do with him.
You make bargain?
Yes.
I don't take a chance.
If Miss Perrie knows, we'll find out quick.
We'll take Miss Perrie deeper in the ship.
Oh, Mr. O'Hara like her.
Very sad.
Too bad he never kiss her.
Yes. Too bad.
Maybe now make kissing before Miss Perrie go because maybe he don't like her when she comes back.
Can I tell you something?
Sure.
Maybe we're through here and because we're through,
I want to ask you something.
Ask or tell?
Ask first, then tell.
Why did you pick me up in Pengwa?
You needed the dough?
My father, he wanted to get out of the country.
Honest?
Yes.
I would have helped you before now, if I could.
Why?
Look, Judy, life at its best isn't much of a bargain.
Someday it may be different, not now.
It's a series of dumb accidents.
Now you're a great guy, you scratch your finger, blood poisoning.
What are you trying to say?
Look, you kicked out one of my lungs on the train.
You were properly sore.
All over.
I don't feel like that now.
I'm trying to say you're wonderful.
That makes me a sap,
I know, but it doesn't make any difference one way or the other now.
You know I'm wonderful, too.
You are.
Judy Perrie, darling, we could have made wonderful music together.
We could have worked and made ourselves a circle of light and warmth.
O'Hara,
I am so lonely for you.
Hey.
Where's my whisky,
Rastus?
Oh, dummies, huh?
Oh, I see.
I asked you for a drink, and that's your answer.
Tough guy, huh?
Make me a prisoner, will you?
Ah! Go away.
What are you doing?
Yeah, put that tomahawk away.
Where's my whisky?
The Herr General sends his regrets, we have no whisky aboard.
Ah, what kind of house is this?
Ain't got nothing to drink.
There must be whisky in those bags.
Hey, what goes on here,
Sambo? What is this?
What did you say?
Do you see this?
Well, now you don't.
What's in these?
When I want something,
I want it when I want it.
Well, that's fine.
Why didn't
I think of that before?
Well, well, well.
Thank you, gentlemen.
Thank you.
Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute.
Sit down.
That's American money, and no Chinese can-
Sit down, please.
All right, I heard you,
I heard you.
All right.
There's more here in the bag.
Get out of my way.
So the drunk fool found the bone.
Everybody please come outside on deck.
What's happened?
General Yang wishes to converse with you.
He's got our telephone number.
Do so immediately!
He's stabbed.
If he isn't dead in 20 minutes, it will be a miracle.
He's our only chance.
Yang?
This is something
I never expected to see.
Who chopped you?
Miss Perrie knows all the time where money is.
We found it in her father's bag.
He hide good.
Now, I must kill all of you.
But the General promised if he found the money, we should go free.
Huh.
Am I free?
Slowly here, my life fall out, fall out in my hand.
You make me so much trouble, you die one by one.
Yang, I asked you who chopped you up, and you didn't answer me.
Don't argue with him, Wu, because he's sore at the world, and who blames him?
It's easy to see that his own guards betrayed him, knifed him.
Huh! What a laugh that will be.
Boys and girls will dance in the streets when they hear how the great Yang was killed by his own men.
Lie, lie. You hear me? Lie!
Drunk fool Brighton make accident.
Tell it to Sweeney.
Even if it were true, where was your guard when it happened?
Where were your tootsie boys who were supposed to give up their lives for you?
My men are faithful.
How do you know?
My men die for me, okay.
They're alive and kicking, while your singing days are over.
When you die here, they'll feed you to the sharks.
Then they'll go where another General will give them rice and put silver in their pockets.
They will not return.
What's to stop them?
They will be dead.
Who will kill them?
They lose face.
They shoot each other.
At whose command?
My command.
You must think we're out of a nuthouse to believe a story like that.
They have sons and wives.
You see answer.
Mr. Wu, Mr. Wu, he understand Chinese.
"Men, do not forget this happening," he says.
"In the temples of Peiping
"and in the sing-song houses of Canton they will laugh at Yang and his guards", he says.
"Only if they are not afraid
"to ascend to the Dragon with him, can they hope to wipe out this shame", he says.
They are agreeing to die with him.
My men faithful.
That's the most marvelous thing
I ever saw in my life.
Excellency, you are to be commended upon the integrity of your guard.
But, uh, might I make a little suggestion?
What about giving the order for my release?
White flesh dies.
Also Mr. Wu.
One by one.
Oh yes, yes, I know, I know.
And very just, too.
They deserve it.
But what about me?
You know, just me?
Thank you, Excellency.
Thank you.
I'm very sorry, but you understand.
You know, self-preservation.
Go.
But, Excellency, you misconstrue me.
Go.
Excellency, you misconstrue me.
Excellency!
Excellency.
Shut up.
General Yang,
I'm thinking of you.
Yes.
You're a brave, great man, and so are your guards, but who will know it if they die with you?
Who's left to tell the story?
Excellency, let me go, let me go!
Yang, what will your enemies say?
They'll say river pirates assaulted you, or Nanking surprised you in the night.
Your enemies will never know the glorious death that was yours and your men's.
What did he say, O'Hara?
What did he say?
Yang, listen to me.
Such great honor should not live in a closet.
It needs the open air and daylight.
Your enemies must not laugh at the memory of General Yang.
Coolies must not laugh.
Peasants, old men, women must not spit on your name.
You can't do this to me.
I won't die.
Someone must be left,
Yang.
Someone who has seen this last, glorious page in the history of General Yang's life.
Yang, listen to me, before you fall asleep.
Yang, before you fall asleep.
O'Hara, O'Hara!
They'll find out the truth.
How? If you stop all our mouths, who will be left to speak tenderly of Yang?
No one, I tell you, no one!
O'Hara!
You'll tell the story, O'Hara?
Yes, I will tell it. Yes.
Of your greatness and the obedience of your men.
Gentlemen in clubs will hear it.
Crowds at the dog races will talk of your guards.
Shanghai diplomats will know it.
Gunboat captains will tell it by radio.
O'Hara, O'Hara!
Every great paper in the world must tell how Yang's guard went to death with him.
The London Times,
The New York Times.
You think we'll get pictures in the papers?
Everywhere.
Because these are not things that happen every day.
You want I let you go?
Let us go.
Us?
All of us, to see no stain or blemish is left on the memory of Yang.
Will it be worth it?
Don't lie?
I swear, this is one true thing.
That's a fact?
Yes. Yang, before you fall asleep.
Yes, yes, help, help.
Oxford.
You will see.
I am a big man.
He was a talented man, but very, very corrupt.
Keep that horn going.
Ten fathoms by the mark, sir.
Hoist your pilot signal lights.
Hoist your pilot signal lights.
Haul down your jibs.
Haul down your jibs.
By the deep eight and a sandy bottom, sir.
- Stand by the anchor.
- Aye, sir. Standing by.
Right ahead, sir.
- I see it. Right over there.
- We're here, boys!
Ahoy!
Be quiet down there.
- Who are you?
- The Flying Cloud.
220 days out of New York...
...and 15 days trying to find your blasted harbor.
Nobody asked you to come.
You got anything in this hog-end of the world except fog?
Sure! We've got gold, mountains of gold!
What are our chances?
You're just in time. We're all humpbacked carrying nuggets around.
- Where are you going, Jerry?
- To the promised land!
Man overboard!
Pilot boat, ahoy!
Man overboard! Please pick him up!
There they are at last, Miss Rutledge.
The will-o'-the-wisp lights of fortune.
San Francisco, the latest newborn of a great republic.
I see a lot of fog and a few lights.
I like it when life's hidden.
It gives you a chance to imagine nice things.
Nicer than they are.
Listen to them.
Men like to yell, don't they?
They imagine they're millionaires already.
More than that.
They've all left lives behind they didn't like.
They all dream of being reborn in the new land.
Do they? Or do they dream of gold?
No, Miss Rutledge.
Behind that fog lies not only sand filled with gold...
...but a new empire for men of vision.
Men of vision! I love the fine names men give each other...
...to hide their greed and lust for adventure.
I am amazed at your idealism, Col. Cobb.
Newspaper men are either drunkards or idealists, Miss Rutledge.
I'm afraid I'm both.
However soiled his hands...
...the journalist goes staggering through life with the beacon raised.
Beg pardon, but there's not much time to pay for your clearance papers.
Nobody will be allowed off ship until they do.
- How much is it?
Tell the purser I'll settle before the ship leaves the port.
Sorry, but there'll be no going ashore unless it's paid.
Here, young man, you get our luggage and a boat to take us ashore.
Yes, sir, thank you.
Thank you, Colonel, I...
A paltry sum to unlock the golden gates of that new empire that lies behind the fog.
Miss Rutledge, you'll pardon an old man for interfering, but I'd like to help you.
San Francisco is no place for so fair a flower as yourself.
Thank you for your offer of protection,
Col. Cobb...
...but I don't think I shall need it.
- Are you ready with the anchor?
- Aye, sir.
- Let her go!
- Aye, sir!
We're in, Colonel.
Boat's alongside, sir. This way.
Will you step aside please and let the lady get in here?
Sufferin' snakes! A white woman!
How much to take us ashore?
- $50 apiece, in advance.
- $50? Why that's outrageous!
This is New Year's Eve, folks, and them's New Year's Eve prices.
- I know, but...
- Colonel, it'll be paid when we get ashore.
Jumpin' Jehoshaphat! A white woman!
What is the matter, my man, tired?
Tired? Say, I could row from here to China and back again without even puffin'.
- Then why the delay?
- It's after 10:00 p.m.
I don't get the significance of your remark.
After 10:00, the rates go up.
A blackmailer at the gates of El Dorado.
Why, it's preposterous.
Pay or get out.
And the proposition goes for you too, miss.
- We are hardly in a position to walk.
- Try swimming.
But I haven't that much money!
Over you go then, both of you.
Business is business.
- You wouldn't dare!
- I wouldn't dare?
You don't think they call me
"Old Atrocity" for nothin', do you?
If I was to tell you the atrocities
I've committed in my time...
...you'd keel over.
Another thing, there's a price on my head in every state...
...except in the Californy, and it ain't organized yet.
Upsy-daisy, over you go, no foolin'.
Wait. Does it mean anything to you that I came here to marry Dan Morgan?
- Marry Dan Morgan?
- Yes.
The man that made the Homestead Gully strike?
Yes.
Moses in the mountain.
Here comes one.
- Who you got there?
- A new white woman.
You're lyin'!
No, I ain't. She's a New York white woman. Whiter than a hen's egg.
Be careful with her.
Give her room boys, she ain't gonna disappear.
- Welcome to San Francisco, miss.
- Thank you, sir.
Happy New Year to the gentlemen of San Francisco.
On behalf of the assembled multitude, allow me to wish you likewise.
That's right and many of them.
Thank you. Would someone please help Col. Cobb up?
I'd swim with my hands tied if you ask it.
Up you come to San Francisco, partner.
Col. Marcus Aurelius Cobb is the name, gentlemen.
That's fine. Anything we can do for you?
- If you're chilly, have my coat.
- Mine's newer.
- Are you hungry?
- You can have me roasted, boiled or fried.
- Find something better than monkey meat.
- Bella Donna serves the best steaks.
Thank you, gentlemen, but I came here to meet Mr. Dan Morgan.
Does anyone know where he is?
She's Dan Morgan's fiancée.
You came all the way from New York to marry Dan Morgan?
There seems to be some mystery, gentlemen.
Mr. Morgan wrote me that if he couldn't meet me...
...somebody'd take me to the Homestead Gully.
I'd like to go there if it isn't too far.
Does anyone know where it is?
You see, miss, Homestead Gully has been taken off the map.
Would you like a little drink, miss?
Could you tell me where
I could find Mr. Morgan?
Well...
Go on, Jed.
You've been doing all the talking.
I hate to be the first to break the news, miss, but...
...Mr. Morgan has been taken off the map likewise.
- He's dead?
- He's deader than a doornail.
- Shut up, you varmint.
- Here, drink this.
How did it happen?
You see, the red come up
13 times straight in a row...
...and the gold mine changed hands.
After which unfortunate incident,
Mr. Morgan sort of...
...had a misunderstanding.
I'm afraid he was a bad loser, miss.
San Francisco is no place for a bad loser...
...especially if you're not so quick on the draw.
Which he wasn't.
I never seen a man take so long to pull a gun.
- He got drilled right clean through...
- Shut up or I'II...
Then there's nothing, no...
Miss Rutledge.
Allow me to offer my heartfelt sympathy.
I don't know why I'm crying, Col. Cobb...
...but that's what men expect of women, isn't it?
- That they should cry?
- You poor child.
It seems my first claim hasn't panned out so well.
You don't fool me, my dear.
You're hurt. Can't I be of some assistance?
You don't understand, Col. Cobb.
I never loved Dan Morgan.
- But you were going to marry him.
- Yes.
He must have meant something to you.
He meant a million dollars.
Miss Rutledge, I'm shocked!
Why? Because, I'm not pretending an emotion I don't feel?
You poor dear.
Let me take you back to the ship.
No.
I'm not running away.
I came here to get something and I'm going to get it.
Yes, but San Francisco is no place for a woman.
Why not? I'm not afraid.
I like the fog.
I like this new world.
I like the noise of something happening.
No, San Francisco is no place for a bad loser, man or woman.
Dan Morgan was a bad loser.
I'm not. I'm staying.
I'm tired of dreaming, Col. Cobb.
I'm staying.
I'm staying and holding out my hands for gold.
Bright yellow gold.
Gentlemen, who got Dan Morgan's money?
I'd forget about that money if I were you,
'cause you ain't ever going to get it back.
Who got the money?
It's in the hands of the worst fiend in San Francisco.
- What's his name?
- His name's Louis Chamalis.
He owns the biggest gambling parlor in California.
The Bella Donna, the one we was telling you about.
- Gentlemen, I'm hungry.
- Of course you are.
I should like to have supper at the Bella Donna.
Let's go down there.
- The streets ain't paved yet.
- I see.
Make way for a lady.
That's opium you smell, miss.
Opium and Chinamen sure perfume up the street.
Make way for a lady.
Don't worry, miss, we'll soon be there.
Look out, here come some more Chinamen.
He's just having some fun, miss.
He's going to cut off their pigtails.
- Why?
- If you cut off a Chinaman's pigtail...
...he can't go to Heaven in their religion.
- That's the reason they're carrying on so.
- It's outrageous, gentlemen.
Surely you would not allow persecution of this sort...
...to raise its ugly head in this new land.
Look out there, partner.
The Chinese are the oldest civilization in the world.
We must not be intolerant.
We must respect their beliefs.
We must...
We must get me out of here!
Couple more minutes and he'd been in China.
Lucky you wasn't on Sacramento Ave.
They lost a burro there last week and ain't found hair of him yet!
- Shall we go on to the Bella Donna?
- Yes!
I hope this doesn't give you a wrong impression of our city.
Rome wasn't built in a day, gentlemen.
The paths of empire have always started in the mud and ended in glory.
I shall make that the subject of my first editorial.
A white woman.
I've got one of the biggest mines out here, miss.
- I'd be mighty honored if...
- I gotta bigger mine than his, miss.
I was thinkin' if you might consider marriage.
I'd like to meet the little lady, too!
- This is Jack Holt.
- Speakin' about marriage, miss...
We sure hope you're going to like it out here.
I'm mighty serious about that marriage, indeed I am.
- Get back to work.
- Sure.
We're taking out more than 100 ounces of gold and that's more than...
Ain't somebody going to introduce me?
My name is Louis Chamalis.
I'm very glad to know you, sir.
Thank you.
I'd like that seat.
Well, miss...
...how do you like San Francisco?
I think I'm going to like it very much.
That's fine. I own it.
What's your pleasure, gentlemen?
This is on the house.
I drink nothin' but rye.
Knuckles, bring some wine.
I hear...
...you come out here to marry Dan Morgan.
Yes.
There's no accountin' for taste.
You'd have been throwing yourself away on him.
You'd have been throwing yourself away.
You ain't told me your name yet.
My name is Mary Rutledge.
Nice name.
I am Col. Marcus Aurelius Cobb, sir.
I'm glad to know you.
- Miss Rutledge is not staying here, sir.
- Is that true?
- Depends on how much I like your town.
- Miss Rutledge, I beg you to reconsider.
Good night, Mr. Cobb.
Hope we'll see you around here often.
Good night, Col. Cobb and thank you.
Ready?
Happy New Year!
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.
- I didn't hear you knock, sir.
- I guess that's because I didn't knock.
How do you feel?
I feel like New Year's morning, Mr. Chamalis.
I kinda thought you might, so I brought you something.
Go on, take it.
We call this a prairie oyster.
It'll make you feel better.
Thank you.
Have you made up your mind about what I told you last night?
Let me see. It was something about...
...marriage, wasn't it?
No, that wasn't me.
Have you something better to offer?
Let's you and me understand each other.
You ain't stayin' in San Francisco to go into society, are you?
You're staying here for gold.
And you didn't bring a pick and shovel with you, either.
You seem to have everything all figured out.
You're quite right. I'm staying for gold.
Then, you'll be glad to hear that you've found it.
- I take it that you're a journey's end.
- Yeah.
That's me. Say, now look here.
You had a lot of the boys last night laying bags of gold at them little feet of yours.
Them bags of gold is mine.
Only I don't have to dig and sweat to get them.
I see. They shovel it out of the ground...
...and they hand it to you across the table with the wheel on it.
You're high-falutin', but you're smart, ain't you?
Yes, I'm smart.
You got a pretty way of holdin' your head.
What's your proposition, Mr. Chamalis?
All right. You work at the table, see?
You're worth a lot to me as an attraction.
They'll come swarming in here like flies around a pot of honey.
How would you like to get part of all the gold that's dug up around here?
Suppose I lose?
You lose only when you wanna and you win when you wanna.
That's the kind of a little wheel it is.
Is that the wheel Dan Morgan played?
The very same one.
Head feel better?
Very much better, thank you.
Then it's a bargain?
Yes.
Good.
Like a swan, ain't it?
That's what you're like.
Soft and slick.
A swan.
One thing more, Mr. Chamalis.
I suggest you get used to knocking on doors.
All right, Swan.
San Francisco is getting to be more like a city.
I've been in cities where they chased me off the streets like a mad dog.
Shut up, before I start doing some more chasing.
Looks like they'll have to build a couple of more stores here pretty soon.
- Do you like this, Swan?
- It's very nice, sir.
It'd look right pretty on you.
I don't like that.
She can be the orneriest critter!
Shut up. I like her when she talks like that.
If it ain't the Mayor of this thriving metropolis.
- Louis!
- Good morning, Mr. Mayor.
I want you to meet a friend of mine.
Miss Rutledge.
I'm sorry, sir, but I'm with my wife.
Come, my dear.
Why, the ungrateful coyote.
The two-faced hyena.
I made him mayor of this town and I'll stop him being mayor!
- I wouldn't do that.
- Why I...
- I wouldn't do that!
- But he insulted me!
No, he didn't.
He just insulted me, that's all.
- I don't like that either!
- You'll get used to it and so will I.
- Now, then...
- I have one gown...
I'll show him and that horse-face he calls his wife.
Buzzard meat. That's what she is. Gimme that.
- Which one, sir?
- The one she's got her paws on.
- Go on, take it. It's mine. I bought it.
- Sorry, miss, this belongs to Mr. Chamalis.
I'm buying that, too. It's mine, put it back.
- What?
- You heard what I said.
I don't approve of your behavior.
- You don't?
- No, sir.
It's my behavior, and it's good enough in this town.
I'll show you some real behavior.
I'm buying this and that.
I'm buying all this, understand?
It's mine. I don't want anyone touching it.
I'm buying everything.
Do you want the fish, too?
No. Throw the fish to the Mayor's wife.
She looks hungry.
Make your plays, gentlemen.
22, even, black. You lose, sir.
I've never seen anything like it.
The black's come up six times in a row.
The red's bound to come up soon.
Sawbuck McTavish is me name and I'm the luckiest man in the world.
I'm sure you are, sir.
Make your plays, gentlemen.
- Make your play, sir.
- Place them on the red, Sandy.
Go slow, Sawbuck.
We worked for that for a whole year.
I'm tired of bendin' over, liftin' gold out of the ground.
I wanna pick up off the table, standing up, let 'er go.
- How much is that?
- Weigh it when the gentleman wins.
- How about bettin' just half, Sawbuck?
- The play is made.
- All of it, sir?
- All of it, miss.
- You're daft, man.
- Daft, am I? Who found Bonanza Creek?
I'm the luckiest man in the world.
I never lose.
11, black.
- Sawbuck.
- Pull in your whiskers, Sandy.
- I want to talk to you.
- I don't want to hear no scolding.
- It isn't that, it's...
- Lost to the prettiest blue eyes I ever seen.
- Make your bet, sir, or get out.
- You were nicer to me a little while ago.
You'd better skedaddle, while you've still got your shirt.
Sawbuck McTavish never skedaddled from a lady yet.
Come on, let's go somewhere and celebrate.
You're drunk, sir.
I wasn't too drunk for gamblin' and I'm no too drunk for love.
He asked for it, gentlemen.
I guess he didn't read the sign.
Go on, pick him up and take him out.
Go on, take him out.
You've no heard the last of this.
Make your plays, gentlemen.
See what he's up to.
Wait a minute, partner, where you going?
I saw the way she ran that wheel.
- How?
- Crooked!
And I'm going to tell the whole town.
I'm gonna tell 'em all.
There's your man, Sheriff.
- No Chinamen allowed in here.
- He's with us. Go ahead.
Knuckles, I'm sorry...
- What's on your mind?
- Nothing serious, Louis, I...
We'll do the talking, Sheriff.
Sandy Ferguson was murdered last night.
- Shot in the back.
- You know murder is a pretty big word.
Never mind, Joe.
All right, he was murdered. What about it?
We've sworn out a warrant for the man that did it.
Before we're through, he'll tell us who ordered it done.
Got a warrant?
- All printed out and everything.
- Serve it, Sheriff.
- Simply a matter of routine.
- Come on, serve it and take him along.
Not so fast, boys.
Where do you think you're taking Knuckles?
He's going to stand trial for murder.
You don't have to take him anywhere for that.
You want a trial?
All right.
Judge.
What is it? How dare you... My dear Louis.
I'm afraid it's rather late so I think I'll go home.
- You're not going home.
- But I have things to do.
Steady, Judge.
Got a little work for you.
For me?
Seems that fellow named Ferguson has just been killed.
Who?
- Ferguson, ain't it?
- Yeah.
- What's the matter with him?
- He's just been killed.
Ain't it a shame?
- It's appalling. Who did it?
- He's your man.
- Which one?
- Him.
Knuckles.
We've got a warrant. We're going to put him in jail until court opens.
- Court's open now. Go ahead, Judge.
- But my dear Louis...
- This ain't no court, it's a saloon.
- It's whatever he says it is.
- But, my dear Louis...
- Go ahead, Judge, the court's open.
Hear ye.
This honorable court is now in session.
Gentlemen, I must insist upon absolute silence. Pardon me.
And will you kindly remove your hats.
Gentlemen, Knuckles is accused of homicide.
- Who seen him do it?
- That fellow was there!
- This is the man.
- Come, gentlemen.
You can't expect me to take the word of a Chinaman.
- Did any American witness this homicide?
- There ain't any question who did it, Judge.
Come on, get going.
Hold your horses.
This court is not going to be hurried.
Will you please stop the music during the trial?
I can't concentrate.
- Give the Judge a drink.
- Thank you.
Fred, quiet on that noise.
That's better.
Mr. Slocum, are you prepared to swear that these statements are true?
Sure.
You are.
Let me put it to you, that if Knuckles did commit this crime...
...that he must have had some reason.
Of course he had a reason.
- Here you are, Judge.
- Thanks.
This man Ferguson passed a remark about Miss Rutledge.
He was vulgar.
What? He insulted a lady?
Gentlemen, do you hear that?
He insulted a lady. A woman.
That sensitive vessel, which from our childhood...
- Come on, hurry up.
- Yes. Of course.
- Under the evidence...
- Hurry up, Judge.
The case is dismissed. Good day, gentlemen.
Have another drink, Judge.
There's your trial.
I hate to see you fellows make mistakes like this.
Might go bad with you sometime.
We'll be back, Chamalis.
Don't come around here wasting my time anymore.
Get out of here. Come on, get out.
Ah Wing.
Knuckles.
I'm just going to cut your pigtail off.
What are you yelling about, there's nothing to wash in Heaven.
What do you want to go there for? Let him go.
I'm afraid, my dear Louis,
I really must be going.
And so, I shall bid you good day, sir.
- Good day, your Honor.
- Thank you.
All right, Tim.
Easy, Mr. Peebles. Don't strain her, sir.
There she goes.
She starts, she moves.
She seems to feel the thrill of life along her keel.
All right, that's enough.
There she is, Mr. Wigham.
The last word in human ingenuity, the modern printing press.
She worked fine. Let's look at her insides.
- Welcome. Glad to see you all.
- We want to talk to you.
You all know Mr. Joseph Wigham?
You're just in time to help christen our new printing press.
The beacon that is to guide the destiny of our city.
Glad to hear you say that, because we want your help.
Gentlemen, I'm at your service.
Go on, tell him, Jed.
We want you to write about Louis Chamalis.
- Criticizin' him.
- For being a murderer.
And running this town like a jungle.
We want to know if you have the courage to print in your newspaper...
...exactly what's wrong with San Francisco.
That's right.
I've waited a long time for this.
She's oiled, inked and we're both ready.
The Clarion is at your service in any cause...
...that will make San Francisco a better city to live in.
That's fine, that's great.
If you'll just sit down,
I'll listen to your story.
All right, shut her off.
The first issue of the Clarion, Mr. Wigham.
Look at that make-up. Look at that type.
Looks mighty neat.
This is something I've dreamed of.
I'm a new man, Mr. Wigham.
Forgiven for my journalistic sins.
Restored to my profession.
There is nothing that can touch it.
One of you stay here.
What's the meaning of this?
- That your newspaper?
- Yes.
Lemme see it.
You want law and order? I'm the law around here and I give the orders.
Why are you buttin' in for?
Did I ever do you any hurt?
This is not a personal matter, it's much more than that.
Listen.
Everybody gets along in this town who minds his own business.
You're trying to spoil San Francisco by printing this kind of stuff.
- Is that the machine this was printed on?
- Get Mr. Slocum in a hurry.
You stay where you are. Knuckles.
What are you going to do?
You just watch and you'll see.
Smash that machine.
You can't do that.
I can't? Smash it till there ain't a word left on it.
- I won't allow it.
- After you finish, burn the building.
- You can't do that!
- This is outrageous! He's an old man.
He ain't going to get much older acting the he way he does. Break it up.
You can't do that. You mustn't do that.
Wait a minute.
Louis.
- I don't want you to do this.
- Get out, this is business.
Then it's my business, too.
- Get out. Let me handle this my own way.
- I don't like your way.
I've never said anything but now I'm saying it.
All right, have your say and get out.
You've done enough things I haven't liked.
I want him to have his paper.
- Now listen, Swan...
- I said let him have his paper.
Tell Knuckles to get out.
Go on, get out, will you?
You heard what she said, go on, get out.
- Do you still want your paper?
- If you destroy my press, you destroy me.
More than that, you destroy the soul of San Francisco, a city...
Cut out the high-soundin' talk and answer me...
- Do you want your paper?
- Yes.
Then, run it the way you should run it.
- What way is that?
- My way.
Next time you do anything, write anything or think anything...
...just ask yourself,
"How would Louis Chamalis like it?"
Understand?
Is that what makes the writing on the paper?
Yes.
I don't want anybody readin' this kind of stuff.
There you are.
You still got your little plaything.
- Come on, Swan.
- I'll come in a moment.
Thank you, Miss Rutledge.
I couldn't have stood it if they'd broken it.
It isn't much use this way though, is it?
A poor shamed thing that mustn't speak.
It can speak, Colonel.
Let it speak the language of the town.
Lies, hypocrisy, and more lies.
The beacon of the new empire.
Mr. Chamalis' empire.
Is this true about Sandy Ferguson?
You should know better than I, Miss Rutledge.
Louis, I want to talk to you.
This is true, isn't it?
Sure.
- Why did you kill Sandy Ferguson?
- For business reasons.
Our bargains included lots of things.
But this wasn't one of them.
I don't like it.
Listen, Swan, I'm running this town and there's only one way to run it.
My way.
I'm beginning to learn that...
...and it isn't a pleasant lesson.
Come on, Swan, have a drink.
I'm one up on you.
You haven't thanked me yet for lettin' the Colonel have his paper.
Thank you.
You seemed almost human for a moment.
How about you being human for a change?
I'd like another drink, please.
Why don't you ever kiss me of your own accord?
Why don't you ever put your arms around me and kiss me?
Wait till I have my drink.
I don't want that kind of love.
I'm sick of you talking to me like that.
I'm sick of you looking at me like I was a snake in a gold skin.
Stop it, you're drunk.
I told you I'd wait, didn't I?
I've waited long enough.
You're going to love me or you're through!
You're going to say you love me and mean it.
I don't want any woman looking at me like you do.
You're going to say you love me or get out.
I heard you. Don't keep repeating it.
- Is that all you got to say?
- Just that I'm going.
You're going, are you? Where?
There isn't a man who would speak to you if you went out of here.
Because they know I'll kill 'em.
I'll kill the first man you talk to.
What do you want me to do, lie?
Lie and pretend I have a heart?
Do you think I'm still Mary Rutledge, that I'm still a white woman?
Shut up.
Look at me, Louis.
Look in my eyes. What do you see?
It isn't pretty, is it?
I'm just what you see there.
Take what you can get, Louis, and let it go at that.
Let's enjoy our mud puddle.
- Where are you going?
- I'm going riding.
I want the wind and the air on me.
- Yes, but it's going to rain.
- I like the rain, too.
Swan.
I want to talk to you about last night.
Forget it, Louis. I'm trying to.
I'll be back in time to run the table.
I'm sorry to break in on you like this, mister, but...
...it's getting pretty wet out there.
What's the matter?
I can't get over it.
- Over what?
- How beautiful a woman is.
I'd almost forgotten, so help me.
Did you ever read about Balboa when he first caught sight of the Pacific Ocean?
- What are you talking about?
- He fainted with pure joy.
You're the most peculiar desert rat
I've seen yet.
Would you mind very much if I looked at you, if I promise not to faint?
You're pretty wet, ma'am.
Don't you think you ought to hang those clothes of yours in front of the fire to dry?
Well...
I'm afraid there's only this one room, but...
I'll either have to go outside or I could use my willpower and turn my back.
- Turn around, mister.
- Yes, ma'am.
I apologize for this place.
I found it myself a few minutes ago.
That's how I happened to join the gold rush.
It was a case of going to work for my father or finding the Golden Fleece.
I'm afraid I'm gabbin' my head off, but...
...I haven't talked to anybody for two years, except my two burros.
I reckon you met them outside.
What did you talk to them about?
About cakes of soap.
Whether I'd shave or not.
Lamb kidneys in wine sauce for breakfast we used to have at home.
- You're from New York, aren't you?
- 14 Gramercy Park.
Gramercy Park!
I used to play there when I was a little girl.
You weren't that little brat with the Shetland pony?
No, I don't think you know me.
I was raised under a bell jar with forget-me-nots in my hair.
Clothes dry yet?
I'll see.
Yes. I guess they're about cooked now, ma'am.
I'm afraid I'll have to use my willpower again.
Pardon my curiosity, ma'am, but...
...I'm amazed to find anyone like you blooming away in this arid land of gold.
You live in San Francisco?
No, I'm just visiting here.
Alone?
No. My family is with me, naturally.
Prospecting?
No, we're just visiting someone who owns a ranch.
You can turn around now.
Would you mind my asking you who you are, ma'am?
My name is Mary Rutledge.
Pleased to meet you, Miss Rutledge.
My name's James Carmichael.
I've never seen you before, have I?
In San Francisco?
No, I've never been there, only to get off the boat and now to get on it again.
- You're leaving the West?
- Yes.
Shipping out like Sindbad with his loot.
Here it is.
I've been poking around for this stuff for about two years.
I keep expecting it to vanish like the figments of a dream.
It's safe now, that is, if I can get by the harpies at San Francisco.
- The harpies?
- Yes, ma'am.
Although some people call them by other names.
- Can I help you button that?
- Thank you.
Remember how Ulysses had to stuff cotton in his ears...
...to keep from hearing the song of the Siren?
They're going to have to sing awfully loud for me.
What does a harpy look like?
They've got snakes in their hair and cats' eyes and no hearts at all.
You can always tell them easy.
This is more fun than digging gold.
If you weren't a lady from Gramercy Park and I weren't a poetical half-wit...
...full of the most idiotic respect for beauty and grace and gentility, I'd...
- You'd what, Mr. Carmichael?
- I'd act a lot different than I'd been acting.
You've been very charming.
That's the trouble with being a poet at heart.
You always have to be charming at the wrong time.
You don't mind this loose talk I hope, ma'am?
There.
I guess you're buttoned now and forever.
It seems to have stopped raining.
I think we'd better go.
I had an idea we were never going to leave here, but...
...I guess that's impractical.
I'm afraid it is.
How am I going to write to you if I don't know where you live?
I write awfully well, something like
Shelley when I'm in the mood.
- I'll read you something he wrote.
- You haven't time, Mr. Carmichael.
This is my road, and that's yours, to the boat...
...and the lamb chops in wine sauce.
Lamb kidneys, ma'am.
Only they don't seem so important now.
- Can't I see you home?
- You'll miss the boat.
Aren't I ever going to see you again?
I'd like to remember it just like this.
The rain, the fog...
...and a poet from Gramercy Park with his bags of gold.
Let's leave it that way.
It's awfully hard to live poetry.
Goodbye, Mr. Carmichael.
Will you take this as a present, then, and read it yourself?
And pretend I wrote it?
Thank you.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Hey!
You don't want a couple of jackasses to remember me by?
No, thank you. Goodbye.
Kind of foggy, ain't it, Josephine?
Maybe that old boat won't sail after all.
Where have you been?
I've been worried about you.
I've been riding, Louis, in Gramercy Park.
What are you talking about?
There ain't no Gramercy Park around here.
I guess you're right.
Is something the matter? Did anything happen?
A lot happened.
- What?
- I got caught in the rain.
Got soaked.
Rode back a thousand miles and here I am.
That's all that matters, isn't it?
That's all that matters.
I guess I'd better change my things.
I beg your pardon, gentlemen.
Is this the way to the boat?
- Passenger?
- Yes.
There's no use your going aboard tonight, sir.
That is, unless you want to.
We ain't sailin' till this fog lifts.
- How soon do you expect that?
- A day or two.
I'll be seein' you on deck, sir.
- That's mighty discouragin', stranger.
- Yes, it is.
- You hit it rich and homeward bound?
- Yes.
You don't figure on standin' here until the fog lifts?
I don't know.
Reason tells that's the smartest thing to do. To stand right here.
But I've been too reasonable all day.
Something I left up in the air that I'd like to attend to.
- How about a nice home-cooked meal first?
- Lead on, sir.
Lucky you met up with me, I can protect you from the perils of the city.
Yes.
Yes siree. They had me hemmed in, so I pulled my gun...
...and I clipped one down there and one man...
- Take it easy, you might hurt somebody.
- Don't be afraid, son, it ain't loaded.
It's not loaded?
No, I don't depend on firearms for protection...
...it's my muscles that scares them away.
If you were to know things
I've done with my bare...
Here's a nice homey place for a stranger, the Bella Donna.
Yes. I've heard of it.
Maybe you'd like me to help you carry that gold. You're apt to strain yourself.
No. Thanks just the same.
It's a shame not to take advantage of my strength, but have it your own way.
Some folks are suspicious for no reason.
I never saw more grand larceny behind one pair of whiskers.
- You ain't foolin', son?
- No.
You know most folks don't seem to realize how bad I am.
Let's sit here and I'll fetch a garsin.
What's a garsin?
That's what we call waiters in San Francisco.
"Garsin".
That's a kind of stylish nickname.
Garsin, come.
Quit yer hollerin'. What do you want?
Don't get fresh with me.
I'll shove you off the earth.
Start shovin'.
He's always foolin'.
Give us a minute and get us a couple more drinks.
You'd better make it a bottle, tootie-sweetie.
That's French. Let's wet the whistle.
I think I'll have...
Makes me look a little more ferocious.
If you can't make out what that says,
Number 3 is the best meal.
- What's she doing here?
- Who?
Her? Told you this was a nice homey place. That's the lady known as Swan.
- Swan?
- Yep.
How long has she been here?
Brought her in myself, right off the Flyin' Cloud.
Here's your bottle.
- She come alone?
- Yeah.
But Mr. Chamalis wanted her services exclusive for the Bella Donna.
- Did she ever live on a ranch?
- Her? A ranch?
- The joke's on me.
- If you're lookin' for fun, there it is.
Win or lose, it's a pleasure just to stand beside her at the table.
Can you see from here whether she has snakes in her hair?
Son, go easy on that liquor.
Brought you another admirer, Swan.
All quiverin' to try his luck agin' ya.
10, black, even.
Old man, advise me.
Are those snakes in her hair or forget-me-nots?
It's all right.
He's a little young and been drinkin'.
No, they're not snakes. They're diamonds.
She's got lovely cats' eyes.
What's the delay, Swan. Come on, spin her.
Make your plays, gentlemen.
Quiet. I want to hear the song of the Siren.
- That ain't no way to talk to a lady.
- I most humbly apologize.
I forgot she was raised under a bell jar with a sprig of forget-me-nots in her hair.
21, red. Waiter.
I'll take that.
Let's drink together, ma'am.
To me, James Carmichael.
The dumbest jackass that ever came hee-hawing into San Francisco.
- Put your money up or get out.
- Come on, put up your money.
Come on, spin that wheel. Let's get going.
All right, here goes.
- Gramercy Park versus the hallucination.
- You'd better get it weighed first, son.
We'll weigh it for the gentleman when he wins.
On the black, the color of women's hearts.
Easy. You ain't gonna get no place with them sentiments.
- A little less fancy talk, stranger.
- Sorry to give offense.
7 and red.
You lose this one time, son.
If at first you don't succeed, try again.
That's my motto since a child.
- Is that it?
- Yes, sir.
Knuckles.
Give him this.
Here you are, stranger. On the house.
Thank you. Hospitable of you.
Make your bets, gentlemen.
Had enough, you?
Not so fast there.
- You ain't bettin' it all at once, are you?
- On the black.
- Does it all go?
- Go on, roll your hoop.
Round and round the old willow tree.
Come on, old man of the sea.
Drink to the little ball.
27. And it's red.
- Who won?
- The red. Yes, sir, the red come up again.
Not my color.
You lost! Just like I did!
You lost like Sawbuck McTavish.
Cover up your back or they'll shoot you like they did Sandy.
- Get out!
- I seen it.
To Madam Swan and to Galahad.
The pure in heart and the expert dress cottoner.
One day, the black will win and the harpies will weep.
Don't get excited, stranger.
Go on, take him out.
Make your plays, gentlemen.
Hey, Swan, open the door.
Please, go away, Louis.
Come on, open the door.
I've got something for you.
Part of the money you won tonight.
I don't want it. Keep it.
What you acting so hot for?
I don't know.
Just go away and leave me alone.
Women are like frogs. You can never tell which way they're gonna jump.
The old man of the sea.
How are you?
Son, still feel a little depressed over your bad luck last night.
- Yes, I remember.
- I never seen the like before.
Don't let it dampen that fine western spirit of yours.
I still have two burros left.
That's right, ya did.
But you ain't got 'em now.
They run away.
A very interesting city.
Surprised I have my boots.
- Any complaints?
- No.
No complaints.
Wisdom was never bought at so cheap a price.
You still feel pretty bad, son?
Maybe it's somethin' you ate.
Gall and wormwood sit hard on the delicate stomach.
Gentlemen, I don't want to depress you with my problems...
...but is there a way for the shorn lamb to earn enough money for his passage home?
A shorn lamb of infinite accomplishments and...
...a great mass of personal charm.
I like the way he talks.
I don't.
Nobody's askin' you.
I like a windbag like that around.
- Go on, get him something to do.
- If you say so.
Get busy on those.
You mean these interesting vessels?
We call 'em spittoons and we like 'em shiny.
With all deference to my benefactor,
I think I'll call them cuspidors.
- How do you feel, son?
- Like a useful member of society at last.
That's fine.
- You ever wait on table?
- No. I'm sure I have a talent for it.
You can begin now.
It ain't hard to be a garsin.
Just stick up for your rights when they get fresh with you.
And always take a bottle in your right hand and when they're comin' to...
I may spoil her appetite.
Good morning.
Would you like to see the menu, ma'am?
- What are you doing here?
- I'm waiting for your order.
I don't want you around here.
I don't blame you after last night.
I'm very glad of this chance to apologize.
I don't like sarcasm so early in the day from waiters.
There's no sarcasm intended, ma'am.
You hate me, why hide it behind silly words?
That's not an accurate account of my feelings.
The worst I feel is kind of philosophical.
What are you standing there for?
I told you I don't want you around here.
If you don't mind, I'd like to work here until
I get money to go back to New York.
You could steer clear of the harpies next time.
What would you have for breakfast?
Would you like to see the menu?
I'll give you your fare back to Gramercy Park, Mr. Carmichael.
I'm sorry, but I have some notion on the subject of handouts.
- I'm not good enough to give you money.
- I'm not bad enough to take it, ma'am.
If you don't hate me, I hate you.
With all of your talk about being a poet...
...you're small, mean, righteous, and no different from the rest.
- Would you like to see the menu, ma'am?
- Bring me some toast, coffee and jam.
And yes...
...some lamb kidneys in wine sauce.
Yes, ma'am.
I just met a fellow who told me something very interesting.
I told you what was going to happen to you if I ever caught you lyin'!
I caught you.
What a pleasant way to begin a conversation, Louis.
And before breakfast, too.
- You wasn't alone in the rain.
- You mean yesterday.
You know what I mean. Yeah, yesterday.
You was seen.
Come out with it. Don't sit there like a dog barking at a cat in a tree.
I was seen doing what?
- Who was he?
- Who was who?
Who was the man you were with yesterday?
You're hurting my arm.
I'll hurt worse than that if you don't tell me.
You were seen with him by the water, talking to him.
- Who was he?
- I told you...
I beg your pardon, ma'am.
There are no lamb kidneys.
Would you like the wine sauce by itself?
We're talkin', can't you see?
Go on, get out of here.
Sure.
Who was he?
Louis, I told you I got lost in the fog and I...
I stopped somebody to ask the way and he told me.
- That isn't a hanging offense, is it?
- I'll find out if you're lying.
Waiter.
Bring me a steak and a piece of pie.
Did you hear about the Chinaman being killed last night?
Yes.
I was wondering, Colonel, if I couldn't...
...weave it into this piece about the climate.
Sayin' how sorry we was that the Chinaman...
...was goin' to miss the salubrious spell of weather we're expectin' next week.
All topics sound hollow and commonplace compared to...
...the glorious climate of California,
Mr. Wigham.
Mr. McTavish was in again.
What did he want?
He had an item about the roulette wheel at the Bella Donna.
He says it's crooked, that they stole a small fortune...
...from a young fellow playing there last night.
It's quite an interesting item, Colonel.
Avoid all mundane matters, and we shall flourish like a green bay tree.
The beacon of the press.
In the hell to which all journalists must descend when they die...
...we shall sit at red-hot desks with quills of fire in our hand...
...and spend eternity writing about the salubrious weather of that region.
Let us serve our apprenticeship here thoroughly and intelligently.
How do you spell "aurora borealis?"
Call it Mr. Chamalis' rosy-fingered dawn.
What's that?
You've got eyes, go on and read it.
It's news, that's what it is.
News you wouldn't print in that yellow-dog paper of yours.
You'd better not put that up.
There'll be trouble.
There will that...
I strongly advise against it, sir.
Mr. McTavish, take that down.
You had...
I warned you.
Go on back inside and write a story about the climate.
Stop where you are, sir!
This is the first honest news the Clarion ever had and it's going to stay there!
Stop or I'll shoot!
Mr. Wigham.
Colonel, are you hurt bad?
Get a doctor quick.
Land a hand here, someone.
- Mr. Wigham.
- Yes?
I want you to change the policy of the Clarion.
I want you to write a story...
...I should have written myself long ago.
I want you to tell the people of San Francisco...
...that no city can exist without law and order.
Don't try to talk, Colonel.
Write a story about that flag.
Write that wherever it flies...
...it brings a promise of life...
...liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
There are some people in this town who don't seem to know that.
Let the Clarion tell them.
- Print the news.
- I will, Colonel.
We'll carry on.
Law and order.
Print it.
You've got a job. We're here to help you.
Two of you, come with me.
I don't need anybody to go with me.
Here you are, gents.
At last we've got a paper in this town.
All about law and order.
Here you are. The Clarion.
Take one.
The voice of San Francisco.
No charge, brother.
- All about law and order.
- What you think! Law and order.
She's come to San Francisco.
Buy the paper, she's free.
Law and order in San Francisco.
That's a new one on you, brother.
Law and order in San Francisco.
Law and order has come to stay.
Law and order is here to stay.
"Law and order".
- I'll give then some law and order.
- Lot of 'em running around down there.
Selling those things all over the streets.
And they've got guns to back 'em up.
I got guns, too.
The first thing is to bust the machine that printed this, like I should have done.
Go to the paper and take some of the boys with you.
I won't need anybody.
So you killed Col. Cobb.
You must be crazy. You think you can go on killing and destroying...
No. Never mind about that.
I found this under your pillow.
Who gave it to you?
It's about love. Poems. Who gave it to you?
Do you want me to take the little wheel tonight?
I'll find out who he is, but I'm giving you a chance.
- Tell me.
- There's nothing to tell.
Some rat with a book of poems.
That's what you went for.
That's what made you push me away?
- Who is he?
- Stop it!
I bet he held you and made you happy.
You stupid fool.
Nobody's touched me and nobody will.
- You and nobody else. Understand?
- He kissed you, didn't he?
You kissed him like you never done to me.
Throwin' yourself on some rat.
I wish I had. I wish I could tell you something to make you howl and shoot!
I'll do the shooting.
But somebody else is going to do the howling.
Here he comes.
Anybody with him?
Keep on walking, Mr. Jacoby.
- Which way?
- We'll steer you.
Turn right here.
You call this a fair fight?
You're not in a fight, Mr. Jacoby.
You're on trial, Knuckles.
- For what?
- Murder.
Where's the trial going to be?
The trial is going on now, sir.
Can I get word to Chamalis to get me a lawyer?
I'm representing you, sir.
- With a gun in my back.
- That's right.
Is this the man you saw shoot down McTavish and Col. Cobb?
That's him.
Allow me to cross-examine the witness,
Mr. Slocum.
Are you sure, sir?
Dead certain!
- Where's the rope?
- Here.
- Wait a minute. Who do you think you are?
- We're Vigilantes, sir.
- You're what?
- The Vigilantes.
We're bringing law and order to San Francisco.
What monkey business is this?
I thought there was going to be a trial.
You have been tried, Knuckles.
I didn't hear any trial.
There wasn't any judge or jury.
- Gentlemen, what is your verdict?
- Guilty!
No, wait a minute. You can't do this.
Get Louis Chamalis.
- Who done it?
- The Vigilantes!
They're holding meetings everywhere.
- Who?
- The Vigilantes.
They've gone crazy. They'll be after us.
We must get away. They'll hang us like that.
- Stand up, Rubber Knees.
- But Louis!
This is my town and it's going to stay mine.
- But they're too big...
- Shut up!
Climb up there and take him down.
Vigilantes?
Come on.
Kind of quiet around here, ain't it?
Them Vigilantes sure depressed the business.
- What's troubling you?
- I'm feeling pretty low tonight, son.
Seein' Knuckles hangin' up out there, reminded me I done somethin' I don't like.
- That's easy to believe.
- You're right.
I'm a no-good, terrible old man with the heart of a coyote.
Yes, I'm certain of it.
I wish you wasn't so ready to believe me.
Why?
It makes it harder to confess.
Confess what?
I ain't gonna beat about the bush, then.
There's one thing that's botherin' my black soul in particular.
I found something that don't belong to me.
There it is, you recognize it?
Somebody dropped it by mistake.
- That's mine.
- I was wondering.
Where did you get it?
Off the floor.
Don't look at me like that, son.
Say you forgive me. Just say it once.
Thanks.
It's the first decent thing
I've done in my whole black life.
Sort of overwhelms me.
I feel like a little white kitten, reborn.
- May I reward you, sir?
- The reward.
I took that out myself in advance so as not to delay matters with any bickering.
I see.
Thanks again.
Looks like the fog's gonna lift and that boat'll be sailin'.
- You shippin' on it?
- Yes.
Hate to see you go, son, but things'll be more suitable in the East.
For poets and failures.
He's goin' away, Swan.
This is the second time we say goodbye.
I'm sailing after all.
I thought you didn't have your boat fare.
It seems that this old gentleman rescued some of my loot the other night.
It dropped under the table in the excitement.
And so with a bag of gold, the prodigal returns to Gramercy Park, licked.
There won't be any bands to play, if that's what you mean.
Or any poems to write.
No, I guess not. I won't have much time for writing poetry and...
Anyhow, I kind of run out of subject matter.
Write about a harpy who smiled at you and cheated you.
Write about that.
That's what you believe, isn't it?
That I'm a cheat.
No. I don't believe that.
Then why are you crawling out without giving yourself another chance?
He's just got enough for another ticket, let him go!
That's no way for a man to go, to crawl out of the West...
...just for the price of a ticket.
- Not when there's still a chance.
- Now listen, I'm agin' it!
Go away thinking that I stole your money and sent you back, licked and broke.
- I'll try the black again.
- Son, it's pure folly.
Weigh it for him, Bill.
The gentleman from Gramercy Park bets on the black.
Here it goes.
This teaches me.
I'll never do a good deed again.
You're stakin' your whole future on a ball rollin'.
It's an outrage.
It's not much of a future, win or lose.
- 17, on the black.
- Moses in the mountain! You win!
- How much did he have, Bill?
- Are you letting it ride, Mr. Carmichael?
- I don't know. I...
The play is made, here it goes.
Snatch it up, son, while there's time.
22 on the black.
Sufferin' Moses! You win again.
I can't believe it!
- Make your play, sir.
- Pick it up, son.
- Here it goes.
- Pick it up. It's on a number.
- Are you leaving it on the number?
- Son, it's a million to one, I tell you.
You'll write something about the fog, won't you?
About how people forget where they are and who they are?
13 and it's black.
You won again, Mr. Carmichael.
A bonanza!
Pay off, Bill. The game is closed.
Do I win all that?
The Bella Donna pays 35-to-1 on a number, always, Mr. Carmichael.
Hurry, Bill. Get him on the boat.
I'll take him.
- I don't know quite what to say.
- Say it to somebody else, not me.
I've seen quite enough of you for one day or for one lifetime.
I'm afraid, Mr. Carmichael,
I'm not as good a loser as you were.
Come on, son, don't stand around now.
You know the purpose of organizing the Vigilantes?
- I do.
- Sign here.
- What do we do first?
- Get Chamalis.
That's fine by me.
- The guns are in there. Pass 'em around.
- All right, Boss.
Law and order?
Here are my orders and don't get 'em wrong.
Find out where these Vigilantes are meeting.
- What are you going to do?
- Set fire to the city.
Burn down every building with a Vigilante in it.
- There's a wind coming.
- It's blowing the right way.
Just a minute. We'll need plenty of money.
- How much have you downstairs, Bill?
- We ain't got much.
What do you mean?
You tell him, Swan.
- What happened?
- We lost.
- What table?
- Mine.
How much?
Bill counted it out.
A little over $40,000.
- Who ran the wheel?
- I did.
Go on, boys, you've got your orders.
I'll be along. You stay here.
Who was he, Swan?
A Mr. Carmichael.
Who's that?
One of your employees.
The fellow with all them fancy words.
So that's him?
That's the fellow you traded me in for.
Where is he, Swan?
- Gone.
- Gone?
Listen.
I'm going out and bring your little friend back to see you again.
I'm bringing him back so that you can listen to his pretty poetry.
Lock her in and keep her waiting till I come back with her sweetheart.
You heard what he said.
- Mr. Chamalis is looking for you, sir.
- I was told.
I don't think this is quite the place for you to hide.
I'm not hiding.
- Then what do you want?
- I don't know.
Don't you understand?
They're outside that door.
He's looking for you to kill you!
He's out there.
He's going to kill you.
Why should he want to do that?
Because he's mad. Crazy mad.
Because he's laboring under the delusion that I'm in love with you.
Are you?
You must be mad, too.
I'm much worse than that, I'm stupid.
Love is the only thing I've thought of or read about since I was knee-high.
That's what I've always dreamed of, meeting somebody and falling in love.
When that thing happened, I was going to recite poetry to her for hours...
...about how her heart's an angel's wing...
...her hair the strings of a heavenly harp.
Instead I got drunk, and hollered at her and called her a harpy.
I'm pretty stupid.
I love you.
Why are doing this to me?
Why did you come back to hurt me, make me cry?
Please go. Thank you.
Thank you for being what I thought you were, nice.
- You're coming back with me.
- No.
I love you.
That's why I can't come.
If you just wanted Swan, it would be different.
But you want somebody that doesn't exist anymore.
I stole your money. I gave it back to you, and that pleased you, that's all it is.
It pleased you.
I wasn't as bad as you thought.
You must go.
They're looking for you. They'll kill you!
You're wasting a lot of time talking because you're coming with me.
No.
You're dreaming of something that isn't me.
- You'd look at me some day and...
- I'm looking at you now.
I'm no good, do you hear?
Don't make me say it again.
Too much has happened to me.
It happened to Swan, not you. Listen.
There's something inside of people that can't be touched.
They can stand in mud up to their necks, but that thing inside stays bright, shining.
- I want to believe you.
- You must believe me because it's true.
Loving wipes out everything else.
All this never existed. You'll see.
Are you sure? No. Don't tell me.
Even if you aren't sure, even if it isn't true...
Take me with you.
Stay where you are! Keep quiet and nobody's going to get hurt.
Where's Chamalis?
Here he is, found him by the inlet.
Come here!
- Where'd that windbag go?
- I ain't got no conception...
- He was seen with you.
- I was tryin' to collect some money.
What did he say?
When I was grapplin' with him...
...I slipped in the mud and he on top of me like 20 wildcats clawin'...
The Vigilantes came in looking for you!
They're bustin' the place!
- Where's Swan?
- She got away.
I seen her running through the fog with somebody.
I took the other window. Listen, boss...
Shut up! She went with that fellow?
She'll try coming around to the boat.
But she's too smart to come down this way.
But, Boss. Listen...
Shut up! She'll probably try rowing around to the off side.
We'll get some boats.
You stay here and watch the wharf.
- What about them?
- Stay here.
Come on, we'll get some boats.
- Right where Old Atrocity said it would be.
- Bless his heart.
Hurry, darling.
You just sit there and steer.
Say port or starboard and I'll obey.
Do you still love me?
Ask me that when I'm an old woman with gray hair.
I'll tell you I haven't begun to love you yet.
I'll have to wear this dress for three months.
- You'll get tired of it.
- We'll put it in a museum.
There's a good one in Hoboken.
- I thought I heard something.
- No, that was me, flying through the air.
Head straight for the big boat.
Row carefully, darling.
He'll figure out where we're going and come after us.
- Are you happy?
- Yes.
But I wish I had some other dress on.
I must look so foolish.
It would take me from here to China and back to tell you how you look...
I heard something.
That's a bird hunting for fish.
We've turned the wrong way.
Starboard, Mr. Carmichael, darling.
It's hard rowing when you're so emotional.
Darling, where's your money?
Lordy, I forgot.
I left it right outside your window.
That's the most idiotic thing I've ever done.
- $40,000, darling.
- Do you mind?
- I don't mind anything.
Same here.
I'm rowing out of the Golden West with...
I heard something.
Someone's rowing over there. Listen.
Keep pulling, you weasel.
- Chamalis.
- Don't mind.
I don't.
I take it back about not liking the fog.
I'm very fond of fog.
So am I.
They're moving in the same direction.
Darling, the fog is thinning.
- Is it?
- A little. Here comes the moon.
This is one poet that hates the moon.
There they are, boss.
Pull to the left. Pull hard.
They've heard us. They're coming this way.
Don't, you fool, you'll hit her.
Get down!
I'll never forgive that moon.
Are you all right?
I'm very frightened, but otherwise...
Can you row any faster?
I'll try.
- Jim, I love you.
- I adore you.
Whatever happens...
- What is it?
- A little accident.
We can't make it, Jim.
Jump over, you can swim.
Get down.
You hit him. Keep pulling.
- Do you see them?
- No.
Here, darling.
I'm not much help, I...
That's all right, but hurry, come, darling.
- Mary.
- Darling, they're coming.
They landed somewhere around here.
- Can you see them?
- Keep quiet.
Mary, you go on.
Quiet, everybody. Listen.
You thought you'd get away?
- The moon was on your side.
- Wait.
Get out of the way.
I'm going to put him out of his misery.
Before you shoot, listen to me!
You wanted me to love you. You held me in your arms and asked me to love you.
Do you still want it?
If you do, I will. I'll love you.
Don't kill him. Let him go.
Let him go and I'll love you the way you've always wanted me to.
I'll forget him, I swear I will.
He's never even touched me.
He's never even kissed me.
Let him go?
- He's never touched you?
- No.
On account of him, you'll feel for me like I've always wanted you to?
- On account of him?
- Not just on account of him...
...but if you do this, you'll be a fine man.
You'll be the kind of a man that a woman could love.
- How do I know that you'll do that?
- Because I give you my word.
Not Swan's word but the word of someone you haven't known yet.
Somebody you'll like much better than Swan.
I'll do it. I got to do it.
That's what I want.
Come here. Pick him up.
- What for?
- Pick him up.
Throw him on that boat.
I want him on that boat!
There are lots of people in this town trying to give me orders, but you ain't.
- Do what I told you.
- Thank you, Louis. Be careful.
He'll make it.
We'll have him on his feet before he lands in New York.
- The tide's changing, sir.
- Folks, you'd better be saying goodbye.
We are sailing.
Goodbye, son.
Goodbye.
You left something outside the window.
I gave it all to the Captain.
There was five bags.
Can you imagine. I must have missed this one.
Goodbye, son.
Mary.
Yes, Jim.
We made it.
Be quiet, darling. Don't talk.
Nothing can ever come between us anymore.
No.
Go to sleep, darling.
Lay aloft. Unfold the topsails.
We'll take good care of him, miss.
Come on.
- Thank you, Louis.
- You did thank me.
Thank you again, and I'll always thank you.
You'll never regret it, I swear it.
So that's the way a woman looks when she's in love.
Hurry, Louis, don't stop.
And that's the way she cries when she loves somebody.
- Hurry, please.
- Wait a minute.
You're going to love me now.
- You're going to look like that for me.
- Yes. I'm going to keep my word.
You're never going to regret it.
I'm never going to regret it because I'm never going to see you again.
I don't take presents off spittoon cleaners.
I don't take presents off anybody.
I give 'em.
I've got things to do here without tying myself up to somebody...
...who's going to cry for somebody else all the time.
What's the matter? You understand English?
Go on back to him now.
Chamalis, we want you.
All right.
What are you standing there for? Say goodbye?
All right.
Is that the way a gentleman does it?
Come on.
Come on. Let's get.
Hi, Murray.
Hello, Sam.
Well, hiya, Bill.
Hiya, Murray. Hiya, Captain.
How 'bout a splash of hot java?
Coming up. Hiya, Doc.
How are you, Baggs?
Why, you old ticket puncher, I thought you'd pulled the pin on us and left.
Sure have, Murray. Got myself as pretty a piece of land as you ever saw.
Say, who's the new brakie?
Him? Oh, that's Willie Figg.
Willie, meet Mr. Murray Sinclair, our wrecking boss. Glad to know ya, Willie.
And don't forget, Willie. When you pile 'em up, there's a poor goat that's gotta clean up the mess
What are you doing out this way,
Murray? There was a wreck, wasn't there?
Nah. Just a rock slide and a broken arm. Lost a couple of empties.
- Hardly worth the trip, was it, Doc?
- No. Hardly. Hardly.
- You sound disappointed, Murray.
- Yeah. The bigger they are, the better I like 'em
It ain't like the old days, Bill.
The roadbed's as flat as a pool table.
All this new equipment, inspections every time you turn around...
In a few years, we'll be railroading in a dress suit, the way things are goin;
Get this: "Warning, all personnel, Rocky Mountain division.
"Barton Brothers held up Cheyenne
Express last week. Guard murdered.
Barton's heading your vicinity. "
Why, the dirty, murdering snakes.
Yeah, but look what else it says:
"Luke Smith detailed to case.
'Give him every cooperation.
Luke Smith?
Signed,
P.L. Bucks, President. "
Let me see that.
Good old Smitty.
Now, there's a guy.
You know him?
You hear that?
He asked me do I know him. Why, we were practically weaned off the same bottle.
Came west, started railroading together right here on this division.
Yes. Smith rode shotgun for us in the payroll car. Sure.
A couple of years, me and Smitty roomed together at Emmy's. Remember?
Yeah. Yeah. That was before
Marian and I were married.
Now he's way up there...
Whispering Smith.
Trouble-shooter for President Bucks himself.
Guys like Smitty they don't make anymore.
What's he like? Well, he's sort of quiet and gentle-like.
Till somebody spits in his eye. Then he's like a rattler.
He just naturally unwraps himself.
Why, I've seen him toss six slugs into a gent's belly button and never even seen him draw his guns
Yeah, but why do they call him "Whispering Smith"?
Sonny boy, if you ever run off with the company payroll... and you hear somebody behind you talkin' low and quiet, it's Whispering Smith and you're in trouble
What in the blazes? What does he think he's doing up there?
Hey, you, Willie. Get forward and tell that hogger to keep rollin'.
Maybe somebody's trying to flag us down. Yeah. Maybe the Barton Boys.
Better get back.
Looking for someone?
Smitty! Smitty, we were just talking about you.
How are ya, anyhow? Get away from me, you big buffalo.
What have you been doing with yourself? Hello, Baggy.
Hiya, Cap. Well, Doc, this is just like coming home.
Come here, sweetheart. Let me look at you. Boy, it's good to see you.
You too, Murray. Here. Let me help you off with these wet things.
Get him a cup of coffee, Cap. You sure picked a fine night for a walk.
Sit him down. What's the matter with you? Don't you like horses anymore?
Sure. I had one, but they shot it out from under me.
The Bartons?
Yeah. The Bartons.
How do you know?
This wire.
They won't get very far in this weather. The way I see it, they'll hole up in Williams Canyon.
Then maybe you'll be around for a spell, huh? Maybe.
That's great. Boy, when I take you home, Marian's gonna just naturally fall flat on her face.
How is Marian? Wait till you see her, and wait till you see my ranch.
I've got a spread that'll knock your eyes out.
- Where's the next open telegraph station?
- An operator at Coyote Creek, but we don't stop.
I guess we have to. I gotta wire the sheriff at Medicine Bend.
Yes, sir.
Coyote Creek it is.
When's the next train?
Which way?
- Either way.
- There's one due about now, but she don't stop.
She'll stop.
Get out your lantern.
Well? Get out your lantern.
Get movin;
Looks like she's stoppin'.
Sure enough is.
You and Gabby unhook the engine.
I'll see nobody gets off.
Come on. Let's go.
All right, hogger.
Back her up.
I said back her up.
Gabby, stand by to unhook her.
What's the matter, Barton?
Did your horses play out on ya?
Drop that gun on the seat.
Come on.
Get over here.
You hold him.
Smitty.
Smitty, you all right?
Get Barton. The operator...
They've shot him.
Go get Doc. Don't just stand there. Go get him.
Doc can't do anything.
The poor guy's dead.
Hey, Doc! Doc!
They got him!
What? Are ya a crazy fool?
Why didn't you call for help?
Always tryin' to fight the whole world single-handed.
Marian.
Hello, Luke.
Hello, Marian.
The doctor said to keep you warm.
This your place?
Yes. Murray brought you.
Oh.
It's good to have you here, Luke, even if it did take a bullet to bring you.
How bad is it?
You're lucky. By rights, you oughta be dead. Look.
Oh. Oh, I should've had this in my side pocket.
Remember?
Yes, if it's the one
I gave you.
It's the same one, all right.
It was such a long time ago.
Five years is a long time.
Where's Murray?
Asleep.
Oh.
You'd better get some sleep too.
It's almost daylight.
The doctor said the only thing to worry about was fever.
You're gonna be just fine.
Good night, Luke.
Good night, Marian.
Marian?
Yes?
Nothing.
I just want to say thanks for... everything.
Hi, Marian, how 'bout that hot water?
Coming.
All right. All right.
So one of these days, you'll stop a couple of bullets with your teeth, and you'll end up...
I know. I know. I'll end up probate, with coyotes chewing the buttons off my pants.
Luke, such talk!
It's not me. It's Murray.
That's all he's been saying the last two days.
I wish you'd think up some other words.
Now, on the level, Smitty. When are you gonna give up riding herd... on express car bandits and get somethin' for yourself?
Such as what? Well, for one thing, you could quit the railroad and throw in with me.
Huh? Sure. I've got more ranch than one man could ever handle.
You put in with me, you can write your own ticket. We'll run the Circle "Z" 50-50.
What do you say? Well?
Nice offer, Murray.
It just isn't in the cards.
- Why not?
- Well, l... For the first thing, I've got my job.
Job. You call that thing you've got a job? A railroad cop?
I like the railroad, Murray. It's in my blood just like it's in yours.
- You talk to him, will you, Marian? Tell him he's crazy. - I think Luke should decide for himself.
Well, how about it, Smitty?
- Sorry, but thanks just the same.
Well, I'm not begging'.
- You must be out of your mind, though.
- Look out, Murray. You'll cut his throat.
Well, maybe I should.
Let some sense into him.
There.
Now you can pretty him up.
Thanks for the shave.
But next time, use a pair of pliers.
They'll pull out easier. Say, what are you whacking into this skirt for, honey?
I'm shortening it. Ho, ho, ho. You see that, Smitty?
You haven't been here five minutes, and already, she's wanting to show off her legs.
Murray, please!
- All set, Murray?
- Yeah. I'll be right with you.
Where you goin'? Into town. I'm three days late with my report on that wreck.
Old shiny pants'll be bawling' like a stuck calf. "Shiny pants"?
Yeah. The new division superintendent,
George McCloud. You know him? No.
He's a college guy. Got a little book called How to Run a Railroad. Bye.
Take good care of him,
Marian.
What's the trouble, boys? It's that sheepherder,
Rostro. He's back up in the North Flats again.
Yes, and them stinking', woolly maggots has grazed off better than a half section of good cow feed.
- What did you do about it?
- Nothing'. We...
Nothing'? Why, you dumb beef heads, what do you think I'm paying you for?
Go on. Get back up there. Take the dogs and run those blasted sheep clear into the river.
But, Murray, the North Flats don't belong to us. That's government range.
- Rostro has as much right to graze there...
- You keep out of this, will ya?
The trouble with Marian, she been mixing in things that are none of her business and I'm stopping her
Go on! Get goin'!
Don't feel badly, Marian.
He didn't mean it.
You know, sheep'll make any good cattleman edgy.
Thank you, Joe. Cigars in the back. Thanks, Murray.
Hi, Murray.
Hello, Bob.
Hello, Murray.
Hey, George.
Hi there. Hiya, Chief.
What's been keeping ya?
Hello, Murray. How's Smitty?
Doing fine. Just his arm was nicked.
- The doc said it was mostly exhaustion.
- Oh, that's great.
- Why don't you drive back with me and see for yourself? - That's a deal.
- Is all that equipment back from Frenchman's
Flats? - Just checking in now.
Good. Hey, out in the buckboard, fellas, there's a whole mess of cigars.
The crate's a bit mashed, but the smokes are fine. Help yourself.
Thanks a lot, Chief.
Thanks, Murray. Thanks.
Don't thank me. Thank the insurance company. Hey, you'd better get your report in to McCloud.
- He's been yelling his head off.
- Let him yell.
- Good morning. - Well, come on in, McCloud.
Save me a trip to your office.
I suppose you want that report.
Yes.
As a matter of fact, I was rather expecting it day before yesterday.
Oh, you did? Well, I've had a sick man on my hands.
Smith. Yes, I know.
Here it is. And it's all there, unless you'd like it in violet ink.
No, Sinclair. All I'm interested in is its accuracy.
And hereafter, I shall expect these reports immediately you come off a wreck.
Get your hat and coat and let's go.
Rebstock, huh?
Yeah.
Four-X. That's his brand.
Hello, Barney! Hi, Whitey!
Well, hello, Murray.
If this ain't something, huh?
And old Bill Dansing.
How're ya, Bill?
Hello, Rebstock.
You remember Whitey Du Sang.
Yeah. I know him.
- You going to town?
- Oh, just shipping another bunch of cattle.
Say, what's this I hear about Whispering
Smith? Got himself shot up or something, huh?
Yeah.
Pretty bad, huh?
No, no, no, no.
Nothing at all.
Oh, uh.
Well, I'll be seeing ya.
Say, why don't you take a ride out to
Williams Canyon some night for a hand of poker?
Been a long time since me and the boys seen any of that railroad money.
Yeah, I'll do that, Barney.
Well, so long. So long, Whitey.
Giddyap.
Fine.
What's the matter with you, Bill?
I don't like your friends, Murray...
Rebstock, Du Sang.
I know that Whitey. He's as cruel as a soft-nosed bullet.
He'd shoot a dying man just to see him squirm.
He's a beauty.
Did Murray raise him?
No. He's a present from
Barney Rebstock. Rebstock?
You remember him.
Yeah. I remember him.
Quite a spread Murray has here. He's very proud of it.
I'll bet he is.
Luke?
Yes?
It's just a woman's curiosity, but why haven't you ever married?
Well, I never thought
I had enough to offer, at least to one girl
I had in mind.
Then you did have someone in mind?
Yes. l... I had someone in mind, all right.
Was she attractive?
I thought so.
Then you never got around to asking her... to marry you, I mean.
No, I never did.
Do you think that was fair to the girl?
Maybe she was just waiting for you to ask her.
Why didn't you let her decide,
Luke?
Why didn't you?
Well, don't blame the girl too much, Luke.
You can't blame her.
The years pass so quickly.
I know.
Well, there's nothing can be done about it now.
No.
Hiya, Hank. Hello, Smitty!
Am I glad to see you.
Hello, Bill. How are you?
Got yourself another touch of lead poisoning, huh?
Sure look good on you, though. You certainly do.
How's Emmy?
Oh, Emmy's just fine.
Said for me to tell you your old room's all ready and waiting'.
Ah. Having you two kids together again, I could spit nickels.
Go ahead, Bill. Here, Smitty.
Here's a present for you.
And always carry it in your shirt pocket. Oh, well, thanks, Murray.
Well, look at this.
Ready, boys?
Let's go.
Acquaintance be forgot
And never brought to mind
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
In the days of auld lang syne
Met a friend of yours coming out, Smitty. Barney Rebstock.
Uh, Barney heard you'd been shot up. He asked after you.
Yeah. He seemed mighty disappointed when he heard you wasn't buried yet.
Was he headed for town?
Shipping a bunch of steers.
I'll drive back to town with ya, Bill. What for?
A word with Rebstock.
Why don't you keep your big mouth shut? Yeah, why don't I?
Now, wait a minute, Smitty. What's the rush to see Rebstock? I want Barton.
What? Are you crazy? You think he's got
Barton in his hat or somethin'? Yeah.
Why? I got a hunch he's got
Barton holed up in Williams Canyon.
Come on, Bill. Now, look, Smitty.
Let me handle this, will ya?
If your hunch is right, maybe I can persuade Rebstock to turn Barton in.
What are you mixing in this for?
Well, you're certainly in no shape to.
Any other reason?
I don't want any trouble with Rebstock.
Since when has a man like Rebstock, a thief and a cattle rustler, meant anything to you?
If a man's railroading or in the cattle business, he's gotta be friendly with his neighbours.
All right, Murray. Take it easy. This is my job, remember?
This is what Bucks pays me for.
- Good-bye, Murray. Tell Marian thanks for everything. - Yeah. I sure will.
Well, hello, Smith.
Hello there.
Hopping around again, huh? Well, I'm certainly happy it's nothing serious.
- I'd like a word with you, Rebstock. - It'd be a real pleasure, son, but I'm a little busy now.
I wanna get the cattle loaded before...
All right. When?
Well, how 'bout Pete's right after supper?
I'd esteem it a privilege to buy you a drink. I'll be there.
Fine. Come on.
I don't like it, Smitty.
I don't like any part of it.
That Whitey. Did you see his eyes?
They were cutting your liver out.
I'm telling ya, Smitty, you're walking right into it. You, with only one arm.
Aw, take it easy, Bill. Sweet suffering
Moses, boy, why don't you get the sheriff?
Mac? By the time he got on a horse, Barton'd die of old age.
Oh, Mr. McCloud!
Mr. McCloud, I'd like you to meet
Luke Smith. So you're the great Smith.
I don't know about that. Glad to hear it was nothing serious.
Well, thanks.
Heard a lot about you, Smith.
All of it good, I hope.
Good?
Well, according to President
Bucks, you're practically a legend.
He just sent me a wire. He seemed pretty happy about the way you handled the Barton business.
You can tell him the score on the
Bartons is still two down and one to go.
I certainly will.
Luke.!
- Luke!
- I'll be seeing you.
Well, well. How's my boy?
Hello, Emmy.
Ohh.
Oh, Luke, it seems you're always in trouble.
One of these days, you're gonna... Don't worry about me.
The important thing is how are you? Oh, I'm fine, Luke, just fine.
And still got her looks, huh,
Smitty, even if she is falling apart.
Falling apart? You, with your store teeth and your hair coming out.
Say, Emmy, if you've got a horse, I could eat half of it. Supper'll be right on the table.
The sooner, the better, on account of tonight, I gotta see a man... about a dog.
Put him away, Seagrue.
Say, I was down the south meadow.
We'd better get those cattle out of there tomorrow
Take care of it first thing in the morning.
Hi there, honey!
Mm.
Oh, Murray, won't you ever grow up?
If you'll call Luke now, we'll eat. Luke's gone into town.
What for? He had some crazy idea he could nail Barton.
Barton?
Mm-hmm.
Murray, he's in no condition to do that.
That's what I told him, but you know Smitty.
But Barton's dangerous.
He's a killer.
Oh, Murray, why did you let him go? Why?
Anybody'd think Smitty was still in knee britches.
Well, I wouldn't worry about him if he was all right.
Murray, if anything should happen to him, we'd never forgive ourselves, never.
All right, honey. If that's the way you feel about it, I'll drive you into town.
And if you can talk him out of it,
I'll buy you a new hat.
Howdy, Mr. Rebstock. What'll it be? Oh,
I'll take a little of that special...
I thought I told you to stay out of town.
So you did.
So I'm in town.
So what about it?
So you'll be picked up, that's what.
Picked up?
I'm getting out of here.
Did you hear him, Whitey?
He's getting out of here.
Where'd you think you'd be going, son?
There's lots of states in the Union, ain't there?
Son, you can hit the trail from here to China, and every mile of the way,
Whispering Smith'll be breathing down the back of your neck.
Smith?
Yes.
The guy that as long as you live'll be keeping you on the jump.
Hiding out in back rooms. Afraid to walk up to a bar and take your liquor like a man.
Yeah. Smith.
Maybe Blake likes to run.
Who's running'?
You are.
And that's something I've gotta see. A growed-up running from the guy that killed his two brothers.
Why, if you had the guts of a grasshopper, son, you'd call Smith's hand.
You're better off dead than sweating every time a door opens.
And it's gonna open pretty soon now, because Smith's on his way over here.
Where ya goin', son?
Outside.
Me and Smith are gonna need plenty of elbow room.
Say, Blake...
What?
If you need any help...
You wait out here.
Smitty, why don't you listen to reason? You wanna help me, don't you?
You know I do. You stay out here and keep your eyes open.
Well, well. So here you are. Sit you down, son.
Sit down.
Well, you see, Whitey and me's all ready for you.
There we are.
Now then, son, just what's on your mind?
Any favour me and Whitey can do for ya'll be a real pleasure.
- Won't it, Whitey?
- Rebstock, I'll not waste your time, and I'll thank you not to waste mine.
You've got Blake Barton.
I want him.
Well, that's just fine, son, just fine and dandy.
And how would you like him wrapped up... fancy-like, with pink ribbons, or just plain?
Don't be a clown, Rebstock.
- Ain't you got enough troubles?
- Yeah. You want part of 'em?
Keep your hands on that table, or I'll blast you out of the chair. Now, boys, boys, boys. Listen.
Listen, son. You got me all wrong. If we had
Barton, it'd be a pleasure to turn him in.
I know enough polecats without hiding out one of his stripe.
No, sir. You certainly have got me all wrong.
I'll tell you what I'll do, Rebstock.
I'll give you 48 hours to run Barton out of Williams Canyon.
If you don't,
I'm coming in after him.
And that might not be too good for you.
Give me three cards.
Hello, Bill.
Hello, Doc.
Smitty, just saw him walking' down the track... looked like Barton. Don't look.
Get under cover.
Smitty.
You heard me.
I said get under cover.
Good night, Doc.
Hey, come on! This way!
You got him.! Good boy.!
Nice goin', Mr. Smith.
I heard the shooting', and l... Yeah, we know. So you stopped to shine up your badge.
Take over, Sheriff. I certainly will, Mr. Smith.
And don't fall down no gopher holes.
What's the matter, Du Sang?
Are you losing your touch?
Quit worrying', Marian.
Quit worrying'.
Did you see them?
That's Rebstock and Du Sang.
Aw, stop acting like you were his nurse or somethin'.
Hi there.
Luke! Luke!
Luke. Why, Marian, what's the matter?
Oh, I was so afraid. I was so worried that... There's nothing to worry about.
I'm all right.
See? I'm all in one piece.
Hiya, Smitty.
So long, Luke.
Oh, where have you been
Billy boy, Billy boy
Oh, where have you been charming Billy
I have been to seek a wife
She's the darling of my life
She's a young thing
And cannot leave her mother
- Emmy, what's the time? - It's an hour past breakfast, that's what time it is.
He could stay in bed all day.
Can she bake a cherry pie
Billy boy, Billy boy
Can she bake a cherry pie charming Billy
She can bake a cherry pie quick as cat can wink its eye
She's a young thing
And cannot leave her mother
You shouldn't have bothered, Emmy. I've gotta make the most of ya while I got ya.
Ohh, bless you.
Drink your coffee before it gets cold.
Good morning, Doc.
Emmy.
Hello, Doc.
How are you, Smitty?
Hello, Baggs.
How's that flipper coming along?
Oh, good as new, thanks.
Fine. Fine.
You know, that's four slugs I've dug out of him. Sort of saving them up.
Bobby, shake hands with Mr.
Smith. Bobby's my grandson.
He's been batching with me out at the ranch a spell. Oh. Glad to meet you, Bobby.
Say, are you Whispering Smith?
That's what they tell me.
Aw, gee.
Is this your dog?
Yeah. That's Holy Moses.
Hmm. What's he got in his mouth?
Huh? Well.
You oughta take a lesson from your dog, learn to save your money.
Smitty, we've gotta be running along. All right, Doc.
So long, Luke.
Bye, Baggs.
Take it easy, boy.
Good-bye, Bobby.
Bye, Mr. Smith.
Come on, Bobby.
We'll try again later.
Hiya, boy.
Good morning, Bill.
You still thinking' about leaving town today? I think so.
Oh, Bill?
Yeah?
Before I go, there's something I've been meaning to ask you. What is it?
It isn't easy. It's...
Well, it's about Murray.
Since when's there ever been anything about Murray that wasn't easy?
- Now, don't get sore.
- I ain't sore. I'm just asking'.
How do you explain his friends? Rebstock,
Du Sang... the Williams Canyon outfit?
Murray's a growed man, ain't he?
- Or we still gotta pick his playmate?
- Look, Bill. This is your house.
You don't have to listen if you don't wanna. I'm listening.
All right. How much do you figure he makes railroadin'?
I don't know.
I never seen his paycheque.
120 a month, maybe 200, but not any more.
- What are you getting at?
- His ranch.
How do you figure he can build up a spread like that?
- Not on what the railroad's paying him.
- Smitty,
I ain't sore and I ain't mad, but I'm telling ya, see...
Whatever Murray's doin' or ain't doin',
I don't think it's any of your business.
You're wrong, Bill.
He's the best friend I've got, the greatest guy that ever pulled on a boot.
When I see him heading' for an open switch, that's my business.
And it's yours too.
Yeah. Yeah,
I guess you're right.
Here. Quit loafing and get to work.
Well, Smitty, if I don't see ya... I'll see ya before I leave.
Good-bye, Emmy.
Bye.
Well, where do you think you'll go from here?
Utah, Nevada, California.
- I'll let Bucks worry about that.
- Oh, Luke, why don't you stay?
You know why
I don't want to stay, Emmy.
Never wanted to come here in the first place.
A wreck!
Baggs!
Anybody hurt?
Smith, I'm taking a run out to the wreck.
I'd consider it a favour if you'd come with me. I'd be glad to.
Slack off!
Give me that hook over here, Bill.
Okay. Take it away!
It's all yours, boys.
Look out below.!
Check this one, will ya, Bill?
How we doin', Seagrue? First rate.
Here, Seagrue.
Here you go, men.
Cigars on the house.
Seagrue.
Thanks.
Now, look. When you get a load, take it over to Rebstock's place and come right back here.
Sure will.
Where do you want this barrel?
Let's set it up over here,
Frank.
Easy, Murray.
That case ain't even damaged.
Well, it is now.
Look, boys! Come and get it!
Hiya, Murray.
Hi, Smitty. Why, you old buzzard, you. What are you doing out here?
I thought I'd come around and kick the lead out of your pants.
Sinclair, is this brandy?
Yeah, sure. Have some.
It'll make a man out of you.
You realize, of course, that drinking on the job is against the rules.
Sweating out here in the hot sun like this, a man needs more in his guts than plain water.
Isn't that right, fellas?
That's right.
- These cigars. Are they off the wreck too?
- Where else?
Sinclair, I'll give you five minutes; then I'll expect these men back at work.
Why, you...
Take it easy, Murray.
He's only trying to do his job.
He's got a lot to learn yet.
Maybe I should learn him with a pick handle.
Why don't you try giving him a break?
Maybe he'll learn as he goes along, huh?
What's that you're loading?
Oh, just some stuff that... some stuff that got busted up in the wreck, I guess.
You got a match?
Driver?
Yeah?
Whose wagon is this?
- Hey, Murray!
- Yeah!
Fella here wants to know whose wagon this is.
It's mine, and these men are off my ranch.
What is all this? It's just exactly what you see... damaged merchandise, mostly junk.
Where are you hauling it?
What's it to you where we're hauling it?
Junk, huh?
Personally, I'd call it loot.
McCloud, I don't like that word.
Hauling away about $2,000 worth of perfectly sound merchandise,
I think loot's the right word.
As long as there's been a railroad, stuff like this has been for the wrecking crews.
Am I right, boys?
That's one of the things
Bucks sent me here to stop.
Sinclair, you'll unload that wagon.
Dansing, set this stuff back on the right-of-way.
All right, boys... I'll brain the first man that lays a hand on it!
That's right, Murray!
Murray, I think we can talk this over quietly, the three of us.
Now, you stay out of this, Smith.
This is between me and McCloud.
No, Murray, it's between you and the railroad. And I'm afraid that cuts me in.
All right, boys. Clear the tracks.
And lay off my crew, will ya?
If you want my job, say so, and I'll quit.
No, Murray. I'm only asking to talk this over. Come on.
Anything you got to say, you can say right here, but say it fast.
That wreck's gonna sit across the tracks until this thing's settled.
You mean, it's either your way, or you'll tap the whole line, is that it?
That's it. Murray, I still think we can talk it over.
Sure, we can, but it'll never be your way.
Bill, you heard what
Mr. McCloud said.
Start unloading that wagon. All right,
Seagrue. Get movin'. Haul that load out of here.
Seagrue, if you move those mules,
I'll shoot them from between the traces.
All right, Bill.
Unload that wagon.
You want this stuff, huh?
By Judas, you'll have it!
Come on, boys! Lend a hand!
Here's a dress for ya!
- Sinclair, you're fired.
- That suits me fine, just fine!
And me too! And give 'em mine.
Sure, I'm sticking with Murray!
You boys were through the moment you got on that wagon.
You know the trouble with you, Smith. You've worn a marshal's badge so long, you now smell like one.
All right, Seagrue. Let's go. We'll cool off at the ranch with a few drinks.
Hyah.! Here we come.! Giddyap, there.! Come on.! Giddyap, there.!
Come on. Break it up!
All right, men. Get back to work!
Sinclair's a pretty tough customer.
No, he's not tough.
Just hog-headed stubborn, that's all.
Get back to work.! Come on. Clear off that track.! Right or wrong, once Murray starts something, he'll finish it, regardless.
Somehow, we have to fix this up, McCloud.
He's too good a man to lose.
That McCloud, sticking his big nose in.
I bet he just about busted his neck getting his report into Bucks.
You know Murray.
Try shoving him around, and he'll beat your brains out just for the fun of it.
McCloud just doesn't know how to handle him.
- It's past 8:00.
- Bill should be back.
Do you think he'll have talked
Murray into coming with him?
There's a chance.
Like I said the other day...
Marian!
Hello, Emmy.
Hello, dear. Hello, Luke. Hello, Marian.
I just got in with Murray and Bill.
They stopped off at Pete's to have a drink.
Poor Murray.
I guess he really needed one.
He'll be right over.
Bill told us that you'd wired Bucks, interceding for Murray.
I've been praying all the way into town that'll it'll work out all right.
Now, don't worry, Marian.
Bucks has never turned me down yet, and he won't now.
When do you expect an answer from him?
Any minute.
He... He knows I'm leaving.
Leaving? When?
Tonight.
Oh.
Come on, Bill.!
Oh!
Emmy!
W- Well.
How's my sweetheart?
Phew! How many you boys had? We only...
Liar!
Hi there!
Hi, yourself.
I guess I sort of jumped the tracks a little this morning, Smitty.
I'm sorry.
Forget it, Murray.
Smitty, you're all right.
Same ol' Smitty, huh, Marian?
Always turning the other cheek.
Not always, Murray.
Say, Bill tells me you wired Bucks.
Yes, we should have an answer by now.
See, honey? There's nothing to worry about... not a thing.
Smitty wired Bucks, and what
Smitty says goes, huh, Smitty?
Hello, Bill.
Telegram for Mr. Smith.
Thanks, Mickey.
All right.
Thanks, Bill.
I'm... sorry, Murray.
Looks like Bucks is getting himself quite an education.
There are some pretty fancy words here.
"Appreciate your intervention,
"but am convinced that Sinclair has outlived his usefulness.
This decision is final."
Well, you didn't do so well, did you, Smitty?
I'm sure
Luke did all he could.
Yeah, I'll bet he did.
Murray.
Luke is leaving town tonight.
Oh?
Yeah?
I'm afraid Bucks has made a mistake...
a big mistake.
Luke, that'll be your train.
I'd better be getting on it.
Come on, girls.
Let's go see him off.
Good-bye, Emmy.
Good-bye, Luke.
Sure felt like coming home.
God bless you.
Come back soon. Promise, now. Sure.
All aboard.!
Good-bye, Marian.
Take care of yourself.
I'm sorry
Murray acted the way he did.
You can't blame him.
He's disappointed, and so am I.
Tell him I'll try again when I get to Chicago.
Thanks, Luke.
Please write.
Sure. You do the same.
All aboard! So long, Bill.
So long. Take it easy, boy.
Oh, Bill!
Yeah?
Take care of Murray for me, will you? I sure will, Smitty. I sure will.
If you've got the price, we've sure got the thirst! Well, Murray.!
Come on down here.
Sit down, son.
Waiter, another glass here for Mr. Sinclair.
Well, son, I hear you've been having your troubles.
As I always say, when a man's having his troubles, that's when a man needs his friends.
They fired me, Barney.
I guess it's somethin'
I haven't got through my head yet.
So they fired ya, huh?
Well, well.
You know, from where I sit, it looks as though that McCloud just did ya a big favour.
He done me a big favour too.
'Cause it gives me a chance to speak what's been on my mind for a long time.
Listen, son. I'm getting old, kind of stiff in the saddle.
I need a partner, a man with some guts under his belt, like you.
Come on in with me, Murray. What we've made before will be just nothing'.
We can make ourselves a real killing'.
Well, one thing I'll tell you:
Bucks thinks he can run this division without me.
All right. Let him try.
What was it this time?
Same old thing.
Stock train piled up this side of Smoky Creek.
You look a sight. I saw you comin' and put the coffee on.
Fine.
I guess bad luck, like they say, comes all in a lump.
This ain't no "bad luck"... bridges burned, switches left open, journals sanded, freight lost in shipment, cattle stolen from right out of the cars.
No. This is something that's all been figured out.
Do we know who's doing it?
Don't ask me that. Of course we know who's doing it!
And so does everybody from here to Cheyenne!
If he only had the wit to realize it, the fool!
Guaranteed
Cherokee Indian snake oil!
Folks, it'll cure anything that happens to be wrong with you.
I had a woman who come to me not long ago. This woman suffered from insomnia.
I've got a letter from her here.
I want to read you this letter.
It says here,
"Unless you leave town immedia..."
No, that's not it.
That's a personal letter, my friends.
I'll drop you off here, huh? I thought we were going to spend a quiet evening with Emmy and Bill.
This genuine Indian snake oil... Maybe that's what you need, honey... a shot of snake oil.
You've sure been looking kind of puny. Have I?
Yeah, kind of mopey, puttering around the house like a sick hen.
I'm sorry, Murray.
And stop being sorry so much.
Every time I open my mouth, you're sorry.
I'm sorry, honey.
Now you've got me doing it.
Hello, Murray. Hi there! How's my big boy?
The wife.
Friends of Rebstock's.
Yes. I should imagine.
Well, if it ain't the little lady herself, slick as a daisy and twice as pretty.
I sure am sorry if the boys have been disturbing your sleep these nights.
I keep telling 'em, but sometimes they don't realize they're not at home.
Well, l... Maybe I'll go and get myself a drink, and, uh, I'll be seeing ya, huh?
Yeah.
Why didn't you just spit in his eye and get it over with?
Marian, what's come over you lately?
Nothing.
You're not fooling me.
A man knows when he's not wanted, when he's being treated like he was poison or something.
That's not true, Murray.
Yes, it is.
Instead of sulking around like a spoiled kid, if you've got something against me, why don't you say so?
All right. I'll tell you.
I haven't changed, Murray.
You have. Something terrible has happened to you.
I knew before you opened your mouth it would be my fault.
I didn't say it was your fault... not entirely. It's your friends'.
My friends? Suppose you leave them out of it? But I can't, Murray.
Because, whatever you're doing, and I'm sure it's something terribly wrong,
I know these men are the cause of it.
They're wicked men, Murray!
I said, leave them out of it.
I'll talk to you later.
Oh, Luke.
Now, Marian.
Oh, Luke, I'm such a fool.
Please forgive me.
When did you get in?
A couple of hours ago.
What brought you back?
Bucks wired me to come.
Bucks?
Is it that bad? I'm afraid the division's had about all it can take.
Murray.
Oh, Luke, please talk to him.
You're his oldest friend.
He'll listen to you. He must!
Marian! How's my honey?
Where'd you pop up from?
I came in with Murray. Is
Emmy inside? Yeah, go on in.
She'll be glad to see you.
Bill, you... you doing anything special?
No.
Come on. Let's take a walk.
Mr. Smith.!
Hello, Sheriff.
Say, you look a little peaked.
Well, if I ain't glad to see you.
Since you've been gone this dang railroad has been running me ragged.
We sure have. One time, we almost had him on his horse, only he'd lost his horse.
Now, that ain't kindly, Bill.
It ain't for a fact.
Have you seen Murray? Murray? Yes, he's in Pete's Saloon. I just left him.
Now, Mr. Smith... Eh... Thanks.
Well...
Care for me, care for me
If we meet in Laramie
Maybe she'll marry me
Gotta go and see, whoo, whoo
- Hello, Smitty.
- Hello, Murray.
- So you're back, huh?
- Looks that way.
And, boy, it's a sight for sore eyes to see ya. Yes, sir.
- What'll it be, son?
- Not a thing, Rebstock.
I'd like to talk to you, Murray.
This Smith, he's gonna start crowding us.
All right. We'll see who can crowd hardest with the most.
Murray, you've been around the railroad a long time.
You know how powerful they are.
You can't buck 'em.
Yeah? Go on.
Well, a lot of things have happened since I've been away.
What's that got to do with me?
I, uh... I just came in from Crawling Stone Flats.
Yeah?
You were there when that last trainload of beef was ditched.
You're crazy.
No, Murray.
The sorrel gelding of yours threw a shoe. I picked it up at the wreck.
I also talked to the man who reshod the horse the next day.
- Are you figuring' to tie me into that wreck?
- No. It's a little tougher than that.
I'm figuring on giving you some advice.
Well, what do you know?
Murray, this town's gone sour on you...
Medicine Bend, the whole territory... and I don't know how you can sweeten it.
You just got off on the wrong foot with the wrong people.
Wrong people?
So Marian's been crying' on your shoulder, huh?
Marian has nothing to do with it.
I've had Rebstock taped out for a long while.
He's poisonous... murder.
Yeah. Go on.
But keep it funny.
All right. You and Rebstock are in this up to your necks.
I could pin it on you from any angle.
You know, Smith, I was just wondering why I ever thought you were something extra special.
Well, here's my advice, Murray.
Pull out. It's a big country.
Go someplace you like.
Get a fresh start.
- Pull out?
- Yes, pull out. I can cover up for you.
My old pal.
Just full of brotherly love and charity, aren't you?
Why, you're trying to frame me, that's what.
You know better than that, Murray.
Sure, you are.!
Me out of the way and you have a clear track with Marian.
Slipped a long ways, haven't you?
What's the matter, Smith?
Does he make you nervous?
You losing your touch?
Don't let it worry ya.
That's only the first round.
Oh, hello, Bill. Luke.
Emmy.
Emmy.
It wasn't any use, was it?
No.
I'm gonna leave him, Luke.
Marian, you can't do that.
If you leave him now, he's finished.
What else can I do?
Every night, he's with those unspeakable men, here in town, out at the ranch.
They're destroying him, Luke.
Marian, I know how you feel.
Half the time,
I feel that way about him myself.
But we can't let him down now.
Right now, he needs you more than he's ever needed anybody in his life.
But what can I do?
Take him away, make him sell the ranch, leave here.
I've tried and failed.
Now it's up to you.
Is that what you really want me to do?
It's more than that.
It's what you must do.
It's his only chance.
Marian.! Marian.!
Let's finish the game at Murray's.
I say, do you think she's gonna like this?
We'll wait for you, Murray.
Okay.
Yes.
Look, honey. Did you really mean what you said on the way home tonight... about us leaving here?
Yes.
You're sure that's what you want?
It's the only way, Murray.
I'm sure of it.
Well, that's all I want to know.
Where are you going?
I'm gonna ride a ways with Barney.
There's a... little deal
I've got to clean up with him.
You better get yourself some sleep.
Let's go.
Come on.
All right. Don't move.
Put 'em up!
Second section of Number Three. They jumped her while she was taking water at Tower "W."
Killed the guard and got away with all the money.
"They"? Who's "they"? We don't know. They were all masked.
Sheriff, how long would it take you to round up a dozen men who can ride and shoot?
Why, uh, you'll have all the men you need in half an hour.
Good. Bill, you get an engine and two stock cars.
Have them spotted at the loading corral. Right away.
McCloud, I want a clear track from here to Tower "W."
Smith, I can ride, and I can shoot.
I wish you'd let me come along.
I feel partly responsible for this.
Sure, I'd be glad to have you.
Thanks.
Got that straight, Sheriff? We ride to Williams
Canyon, turn back anybody who tries to get in.
That's right.
We'll pick up the trail at Tower "W."
If it's Rebstock's outfit, we should have 'em between us this afternoon.
All right. Good luck, boys. Same to you, Mr. Smith. Come on. Hup!
All set? They've got a three-hour head start on us. We've got to travel.
Luke, take care of him, won't you? Bill, I mean. Sure, I'll keep my eye on him, Emmy.
Look out for yourself too, will you? Yeah.
It's hard to tell, Mr. Smith. It all happened so fast. How many were there?
Not more than six.
Anyone you know?
Uh-uh. Anyone you could identify if you saw 'em again?
No. You see, they all had handkerchiefs over... Wait a minute.
Yeah, one of them had long hair, sort of whitish.
Yeah,
I could nail him anyplace.
Du Sang. Well, thanks,
Woody. You've done fine.
Well, that kind of ties things together. Yeah, the Rebstock outfit.
All right, boys. Get goin'. A little fast riding, you can catch up with the sheriff's outfit.
I'll meet you at Williams
Canyon. Good luck, Smitty!
So long, boys! Good luck!
Good hunting, boys!
Smitty, is Murray in this? I don't know.
That's what I gotta find out. Come on.
Hello, Marian.
Hello, Luke.
Murray home?
No.
Do you know where he is?
He rode out with Rebstock... last night.
Where's Karg?
He went with him.
And Seagrue?
Yes.
Have you any idea where they went?
To Williams Canyon, at least I think so.
You see, last night on the way home,
I talked to Murray, just as you asked me to.
I finally persuaded him that we should go away.
Then he got the idea of selling out to Rebstock.
What's the matter, Luke?
Early this morning at Tower "W,"
Rebstock's outfit held up Number Three.
Made off with a lot of money.
The worst of it was they killed a guard.
Do you think Murray had any part in it?
I wish I could say no.
Marian, you'd better go to Emmy's.
There we are. This is your share,
Murray, and this is for your ranch.
There's yours, Whitey.
Well, boys, I guess that's it.
What is it, Barney, the thin end?
Barney.! Barney.!
They're comin', Barney.
Who's comin'?
Smith, with a posse! I told you they'd be here, you murdering half-wit!
Well, it's no use talking about that now!
Get your rifles, men!
One man behind a rock is worth three in the open. Barney, you're crazy!
I'm getting outta here the back way! This is a hanging'!
I'm with ya, Murray. Me too. So you're running, huh?
Fine thing. A man thinks he's got men behind him, but when the chips are down...
Aw... Aw, well, never mind me. Come on, boys.
Get on your way. I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll keep 'em here just as long as I possibly can.
So good-bye, boys, and good luck!
Barney.
Whitey, what are you doing here?
You'd better get out of here, son.
It's you they're coming after.
Got it fixed up all nice and pretty, ain't ya?
For yourself. You stay behind and give us a nice head start, then you meet the posse and throw it all off onto us.
Oh, now, Whitey, son, you know perfectly well that l...
They got Baggs.!
Give him the best ya got, Doc.
McCloud, you'd better stay here with him.
All right, boys. Let's go.
Sounds like somebody got behind us.
Keep pressing 'em, Sheriff. I'm going on back. Right. Come on!
Come on, Bill!
One of you boys better help me plug up this hole. I left a trail a blind man could follow.
I'll get it, Murray.
Looks like it went plumb through.
Come on. Let's get out of here! Yeah.
Ho!
What's the matter?
Out of range.
Out of range, my eye.
You could've hit 'im with a beanshooter.
Come on.
All right, Marian. Get your things together. We're getting out of here.
Well, what are you waiting for?
You want me to sell out and go.
You were at Tower "W."
What do you know about Tower "W"?
Who told you?
Come on. Who told you?
Was it Smith? Was he here?
Yes.
So that's it.
You were running out on me.
No, Murray! No, I was only...
Might as well get this through your head, Marian.
You'll never go with Smith or anyone else as long as I'm alive.
Now, pick up your stuff.
No, Murray! Don't! If you do, they'll never stop until they hang you.
Then go out there and get rid of ‘em. If you don't, I will.
- Why didn't you go to Emmy?
- I had some things to do. I had to pack.
Luke!
I suppose Murray hasn't come back yet.
No.
No, not yet.
If he does, tell him it's best he gives himself up.
Well, that's one time you kissed him off fast.
All right. Now, get the buckboard, and hurry.
Murray, you must give yourself up.
You can't go on...
Yeah, Smitty'd like that.
You heard me.
Get the buckboard.
Marian.
Luke!
Oh, Luke, why did you come back?
Why? Why?
Murray's in the house, isn't he?
Yes, but he's hurt badly.
You and Bill go get the doc.
I'll stay here and see if I can help him.
Oh, Luke, please don't go in there.
Please don't!
He's crazy.
He's like a madman.
Get goin', Bill.
Get that buckboard out of here fast.
Watch your step, Smitty.
Come on, Marian.
Giddyap!
Hyah!
Marian! Marian! Marian!
I'm coming in, Murray.
Hiya, Smitty.
Hi, yourself.
Is it bad?
Yeah. Bad.
Try to take it easy, Murray.
I sent for the doc.
You're wasting his time.
That last one almost cut me in half.
Here, let me...
Get your hand away!
I'm sorry.
Forget it.
Well, that's how it goes.
Ya gotta have the breaks.
You had 'em all, Murray.
I had one, anyway.
I had Marian.
That's one break you didn't get.
Get me a drink, would ya?
It's on the table.
Sure.
Smitty.
Murray, if there'd been any other way,
I'd have played it differently.
You know that, don't you?
The only cards I had were the ones you dealt me.
How much longer are we gonna wait?
He's coming now.
Mr Kalinsky, can you tell us the reason for your visit to this country?
Gentlemen, please.
Mr Kalinsky has not statement to make at present.
Thank you, gentlemen.
Good morning, sir.
Morning.
Thank you.
Mr Kalinsky.
We're delighted to have you here with us again.
Your usual suite is ready.
I'm expecting a Mr Benson to call.
Have him sent up the moment he arrives, will you please?
Certainly, see to that.
Very good, sir.
The gentleman to see you, sir.
Thank you.
Mr Kalinsky's waiting for you.
How are you, Carmen?
Very well, thank you, sir.
Am I disturbing you?
Hm?
Oh my dear Gregoroff.
We meet again.
Profitably, I hope?
Very.
You're looking well.
Cigarette?
No, thank you,
I'll give you something really good to smoke.
Fine.
Speaking of something good.
The deals and subscriptions from the Key Club this last year amounted to just under 5,000 pounds.
Excellent.
Lucky for us there's so many fools willing to give money in the sacred cause of peace.
Present from a certain
South American president.
In appreciation of your machine guns huh?
What death stealing inventions have we bought lately in the cause of peace?
Well, for one thing, we purchased a gun which kills thousands.
Only it doesn't work.
Then we've acquired a newer and deadlier poison gas.
But which isn't very affective.
Thank you.
The club members were very very pleased.
Good.
May I?
Do.
The sacred cause of peace, huh?
What about the Caldwell aeroplane?
We'll keep that for ourselves.
You're sure that works?
I've seen it.
It's perfect.
We can name our own price to any foreign power.
Splendid.
Now, I'll have the plans for you later this evening.
Then it won't be necessary for me to go to Scotland tomorrow.
We've done all that's necessary in Scotland.
The inventor went there for secrecy.
Which suited us perfectly.
I understand.
What time is the meeting tonight?
Eight o'clock.
At Hartley manor.
And the club members are anxiously awaiting your speech.
I feel flattered.
By the way.
What is the subject of your sermon tonight?
Finances applied to world peace.
Kalinsky in London!
Newspaper!
All of London's enlightened!
All of London's investing!
Ha, Good morning, Grayson.
Morning.
Seen the paper, Colonel?
No.
I wonder why he arrived in such a blaze of publicity this time.
Well, probably to put our minds at ease.
If I had my way, I'd lock him up in a lunatic asylum.
That's where most of his mystery finances ought to be.
What he wants is a firing squad.
What good would that do, Grayson?
Do you know what's wrong with you fellows at the Intelligence department?
Well, what.
You will not realise, that wherever there's trouble, there will always be another Kalinsky.
Equally unscrupulous, ready to make war a profitable business.
Yes, who is it?
All right, put him through.
Very interesting young fellow this.
Scotsman, got an idea for a robot aeroplane.
Very hush hush.
Yes, put Mr Caldwell through.
Hello.
He...
Stay right where you are, Mr Caldwell.
Hello.
Get him to the car.
He's been cut off.
Give me exchange again, will you please?
No, they cut me off.
Would you agree, Mr Caldwell?
I'm asking you a question, Mr Caldwell.
Mr Caldwell isn't answering questions.
He will.
Don't shoot, you fool, you'll kill him.
Quiet, Jocko, basket.
- Good evening.
- Evening.
How long have you been here?
Thirty year, come Christmas.
By the door.
Maybe five minutes.
- Seen anyone?
- hmm-mm.
Two men.
- Two men.
What were they like?
You should know, seen as how you be the two men.
Mind me coming in?
Who did that?
Wish I knew.
And you saw nothing at all curious?
Not 'til you came.
Search upstairs.
Can you keep your mouth shut?
I can, sir.
Well, look here, the man who did that, escaped from an asylum.
It's unpleasant and we rather not have gossip.
I'll be too busy counting these.
Won't take me long though.
That's better.
Cal!
Did you find something upstairs?
Gee, certainly they're long gone.
Come quick to the car.
Remember.
Good for you, boy.
Well, Jocko, what do you make of it?
Cranloch, history,
Caldwell.
There he is, make it to the car.
Come out of there.
You're riding in the back this time.
I wonder if there was a note wrapped around that stone that went through the window.
Well, what do we do now, Jocko?
Walk four miles in the fog to tell the police?
You're right.
We wait until morning.
What do you think of that, Jocko?
No, you wouldn't like him at all.
He's not your type.
Cranloch, history, Caldwell.
Aeroplanes, history.
Air ministry.
Jocko.
It's all right, Jocko.
Oh, forgive me, but the door was open.
Can I be of any assistance?
My car's broken down.
I wonder if could use your phone?
You could if we had one.
Oh dear, what a morning.
I've come out without my breakfast.
Would you care to share an egg?
I'd share anything.
Let's stick to an egg for the present.
Won't you come in.
Thank you.
Welcome to the castle.
I'll prepare the banquet.
Can the lady in distress help?
The lady in distress needs help.
Oh, I don't know.
I can boil water.
And I can burn toast.
I'm afraid I'm putting you through a lot of bother.
Think nothing of it.
If there's one thing I like more than another, it's being bothered.
Living alone?
Oh, no, I have protection.
My housekeeper's returning this morning.
In the meantime, I'm headman.
Thank you, Jenkins.
Thank you, madam, but the name is Jeeves.
Indian or China?
What are you having?
Indian, and you?
China.
Correct.
That's a versatile tea pot.
Quite, sugar?
Yes, please.
Oh gee.
I wonder what went wrong with your car.
What usually happens to a car that refuses to go?
It stops.
Here we are.
Shingled?
Bobbed.
Oh, sorry.
What an attractive bag.
It is, isn't it?
Sort of matches my gloves.
And your eyes.
Let's stick to the gloves.
Well, this is delightful.
It looks a bit strong.
It is strong.
Jeeves will remedy that.
I hope this isn't going to be the end of our acquaintance.
Well, I've done my part.
And I've done mine.
Say when.
When.
I do enjoy a good cup of tea, don't you?
Oh, yes, yes I do.
But you're not drinking yours.
It's cold.
Let me give you some hot water.
Thanks.
Oh hell.
I'm sorry.
It's my fault.
Careless of me.
I'll have to get out of these if you'll excuse me.
I hope I didn't burn you.
Just a little.
Cranloch, air ministry, Caldwell.
Oh, come on me darling, come on Jocko.
Did you think I forgot ya?
Well, indeed I didn't.
Come on in with your mother and see what I got for you, there me child, go on, got a lovely bit of meat here for you, so I have.
Good morning.
Who are you?
Heavens, will you look at the glass?
What's been going on here?
It's all right, Norah.
It's perfectly respectable.
We've only had breakfast together.
Well, this is Norah my housekeeper, Miss...
Thompson.
I'm Hugh Drummond.
Well, I want to know what's happened.
Happened?
Yes, the window.
Oh, the window.
Well, that was a very curious thing, Norah.
A stone came through the window last night with a message wrapped around it.
Go on.
What sort of message?
It seemed to be for someone named Ints in Mundesley.
How exciting.
Did you call the police, Mr Hugh?
Ah, that's the sad part of it.
Jocko ate the evidence.
What a pity.
Yes, isn't it?
Now, let's see if we can do something about your car.
No, no, it's a messy job.
I've already spilled tea all over you.
Oh, what's a pair of pants between friends?
I don't suppose there's anything really wrong with the car.
No, I don't suppose there is.
It just stopped.
They do sometimes.
But generally a reason, don't you think?
I suppose so.
It's a good point to start from.
You know I've found very few women who can handle cars.
I found very few men who can handle women.
Your starter works.
So I've heard.
You have no spark.
That's the first complaint I've had.
Please, I'm still talking about the car.
I think you'll find they run better with the wires connected.
Ow!
Oh, I'm sorry.
My hand slipped.
I hope that doesn't happen often.
Not very.
Thank you, Mr Drummond.
Don't mention it.
Good bye, Mr Drummond.
Oh, I hope you don't mind running me into Cambridge.
I wanna collect my car.
After all you had one of my eggs.
So, I did.
I hope you're not nervous.
Oh, not a bit.
I've got to telephone my uncle.
All right.
You want any pennies?
No, thank you.
Ring up a good hospital for me while you're about it.
That's an idea.
Yes.
It's Doris.
You didn't get anything?
What the devil do you think we send you there for?
Did you search the place?
Find any sort of message?
Says the fella told her there was no message.
Did you get his name?
Drummond?
Drummond!
Captain Drummond.
Uncle all right?
He needed cheering up a bit.
He was a little worried.
Who isn't?
I'll drop you at my hotel.
Just stop, I'll get out.
Send the car to the garage.
I hope you enjoyed your ride.
Well, good bye, Mr Drummond.
Oh, I'm not leaving you yet.
I just remembered
I didn't finish my cup of tea this morning.
You surely wouldn't leave me to drink my tea alone.
After all...
- I know, the egg.
- Morning, Miss Thompson.
- Morning.
Tea for two please.
Oh, but I really ought to be going.
Remember the egg.
Will you excuse me a moment?
I have to telephone my aunt.
Hello.
Oh, hello.
Hugh.
Dear old boy, is it serious?
What do you mean, drinking with a Bodger?
Tried to poison your tea?
I don't like the sound of it at all.
What?
Well, naturally, of course, I'll come at once and in the meantime, if you meet her again, fool her, order coffee.
Aunt all right?
Trifle depressed.
I'm sure she needn't be.
This is cosy, isn't it?
Good bye.
Oh, good bye's so final.
Why not make it Au revoir or auf Wiedersehen or even so long?
Good bye, Mr Drummond.
The jury fail to agree.
Waiter.
- Yes sir.
How long has Miss
Thompson been staying here?
Three or four weeks, sir.
She and her uncle, Dr Belfrus.
Why?
- He's nuts.
- Nuts?
- Screwy.
- Screwy?
Do you mean batty?
Yes, balmy.
Thinks he can stop wars, sir.
Him and his friends hold meetings about it, sir.
They call themselves the Key Club.
Key Club?
Yes, that's their badge, sir, a key.
The key what unlocks the door to peace.
Lot of hoo wee, sir.
What about your tea, sir?
What time is it?
Half past 11.
Bring me a beer.
Yes sir.
No, couldn't be the best
Indian tea at that price.
All right, lady, we often meet people like you.
Now, here's a sample packet.
Make a cup now and judge for yourself.
Well, mind, if I don't like it, I won't buy it.
All right, lady, I'll be coming back.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Norah, Norah.
Jocko, Jocko!
Come on out.
Feet first.
All right, Jocko.
I ain't done nothing, mister.
I swear, I ain't done nothing at all.
Nothing, where's my housekeeper?
How should I know?
That's what I'm gonna find out.
I don't know where she is, I tell you, governor, governor, I don't know where she is,
I don't know anything about, I swear I don't.
We'll leave in a moment, Jocko.
Now, who sent you here?
So, that's it.
Perhaps this will put some light on the subject.
Don't do it, governor, don't do it, I'll tell you.
Well.
It's the Key Club.
Go on.
We take our orders from Dr Belfrus.
Yes?
The club's a blind.
Oh, and who gives Belfrus his orders.
I can't tell you, oh, I can't tell you.
All right, all right.
The name of the man who gives the doctor his orders is...
Now, we'll get down to serious business.
Norah!
Norah!
Norah.
Norah.
Drugged.
Oh dear.
I feel queer, I must be.
I must be getting old or something.
Oh.
- Ringmond.
- Yes.
I tell you these things don't happen in England.
Oh, don't they?
Are you sure the man is dead?
If he's not my name's not Drummond.
Well, you should know, Bulldog.
Where's the body?
There.
He's obviously quite dead.
Obviously.
Just a formality.
Oh darling.
What?
Oh, hello, Hugh.
Why the boy scouts?
There was a man in that chair.
There is.
Stop playing the fool.
Suppose you stop playing the fool, sir.
When he arrived there was a man tied in that chair, dead.
No.
Is this your idea of a joke, Mr Drummond?
But I assure you.
I take this a very serious matter at the moment.
Now, wait a moment.
What's going on here?
You all right, Norah?
Of course I'm all right.
D'you know, I must be getting old or something,
I got a terrible headache, then I fell asleep.
My goodness, look at the state of the place.
Come along.
You know it's a serious offence to lead police officers on a wild goose chase?
Don't let it happen again.
I don't think he likes you, old boy.
Incredible.
Oh, you're here, are you?
I might've known it.
Once you two get together, there's sure to be trouble.
Ah, but darling, surely you love it.
Ah, go on, out with that, would you.
This is serious Algy.
Got you down, hey?
Got me going.
Good, after you telephoned me,
I got in touch with Grayson.
He'll meet us at the hotel at six.
You think of everything, don't you?
Well, one of us must, after all, don't you think so?
Oh.
Ah, here you are, waiter.
Waiter.
Oh, my mistake.
When Caldwell wasn't put through, you suspected nothing?
No reason to.
I thought we were just cut off.
Does the name Cranloch mean anything to you?
Caldwell's workshop, it runs from a place called Cranloch Head.
Cranloch Head.
And Jocko ate the Head.
And you believe this Key Club is mixed up in this thing somehow?
I do.
I think it's at the back of the whole thing.
Okay, Grayson, what are you smoking?
Sailors' socks?
The girl puzzles me.
After she tried to poison him.
Just a boy scout old fellow.
I say, waiter, what about a little service?
Maybe I'm wrong.
Do you mind?
Certainly not.
A bit crowded.
Fearful, fearful.
You come here often?
Quite often, quite often.
I say, look here.
Excuse me, sir, what is that?
Member of the Key Club, you know, the Key Club.
And what does the key represent?
It represents the unlocking of the door to a more satisfactory world.
There's a meeting of the local branch tonight.
Very large membership, very large.
What, a meeting here?
No, no.
Hartley Towers.
Local secretary's place.
And who's he?
Dr Belfrus.
Nice chap, nice chap.
There.
And there.
What'll you have, sir.
Thanks very much, I'll have the same.
- There.
- Thanks very much.
- This is Mr...
- Portside, Reginald Portside.
Cheers.
Cheers, cheers.
Mr Portside is an important member of the Key Club.
You were asking about that only the other day.
Oh, was I?
Oh, so I was, what?
Can you take visitors?
With pleasure, with pleasure.
We welcome recruits.
There's your chance, Algy.
Mr Portside says the Key
Club welcomes new members.
If you'll be kind enough to introduce my friend.
Please, please.
Oh, yes, but you've got something else on tonight, haven't you, Algy?
I'd be very interested.
Then come along, sir.
Come along.
We're leaving at 8:15, 8:15, excuse me.
I say, why does he have to say everything twice?
Just doubly anxious, old boy.
I didn't quite get your name, mr...
Davenport, Gerald Davenport.
Gerald Davenport, thank you.
Come on.
Ladies and gentlemen.
It makes me very happy to see such a representative gathering assembled for our meeting this evening.
That's Dr Belfrus.
The occasion is doubly momentous.
Because we have with us tonight a very distinguished guest who has promised to address you on a topic which is very near to all our hearts.
That of world peace.
The famous financier, Mr Ivan Kalinsky.
Members of the Key Club.
It is a great honour and privilege to address you this evening.
Does your car always break down just after it's been repaired?
No, it's usually repaired just after it's broken down.
Why not have it repaired first?
Oh, oh dear, oh dear.
Not tired are you?
Oh, no, no, no, I got beyond that miles back.
Oh, thanks, so much, old boy.
What did nature give you two feet for anyway?
One for the clutch, one for the accelerator.
And above all, ladies and gentlemen, simply if I can say...
Oh, Hugh, do you realise all the people in there are sitting down?
Quiet.
But what is this Key Club, a jamboree for locksmiths?
It's a blind.
You mean something crooked?
Right.
Here, old boy.
There it is, ladies and gentlemen.
As simply as I can state it.
There can be no war without weapons.
And no weapons without money.
And the power of money, my friends, is harnessed on the side of sanity, of progress and of peace.
Jolly good, jolly good.
Coffee and sandwiches now.
I hope.
There she is.
The waitress?
No, the second from the end.
Where do you think you are?
The Folly Bezier?
Who is she?
The woman I had tea with.
Oh, Mrs Bodger.
Oh, Mr Gregoroff, may I present Mr...
Davenport.
Glad to see you here.
Most interesting.
Excellent speech from Mr Kalinsky, straight from the shoulders, straight from the...
If you'll excuse me.
I'm glad you see it.
How old are these thing?
Fighting boss to give their cooperation.
Yes, I suppose that as for us all.
Excuse me.
Shut the door.
What's up?
There's a British Agent at this meeting, named Grayson, calls himself Davenport.
Are you sure?
I never forget a face.
They're up to something and we've got to get Caldwell out of here.
Go upstairs, I'll join you presently.
Come on, let's get hold of Grayson, he'll give us a lift.
My shoes are so full of feet.
Not yet.
But why not, everything's over.
Everything's just beginning.
What's happened?
I just met Gregoroff.
He's tumbled me.
Then we might as well go home.
I've got to go the
Inn with our fat friend.
But when I can get rid of him, I'll wait for you at the cottage.
Better stay at the hotel, there's no phone
You sure you won't want me?
I got Algy.
And I got sore feet.
Well, I'll see you in a while.
I'm sorry I can't stay longer, but I must get back to London.
Good night.
It's been a great honour, Mr Kalinsky.
Good night.
- Good night.
That was the only way to get in that room.
Why not use the open window?
We'd better think of a reason for being there.
Let me think.
I'll save you the trouble.
You've lost your hat.
Here, I say.
Come on, follow me and don't get lost.
I don't like my hair.
Down, Algy, down.
What are we looking for?
Your hat.
Hello, what are you looking for?
I have no idea, sir?
Splendid, fellow.
My friend has lost his hat.
Hat, sir?
Did you look in the cloak room?
Did you look in the cloak room, Algy?
No.
Where is it?
Over there, sir.
Thank you very much.
We're expecting you at the next meeting of the Key Club.
Thank you, you're doing wonderful work, Doctor.
Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Well that's the last of them.
You can lock up now.
Very good, sir.
It's been one of the most enjoyable evenings
I've ever had, Dr Belfrus.
I'm very glad, Miss Thompson.
Gregoroff wants to see you upstairs as soon as the house is clear.
Anything wrong?
You're asking me?
You'd better be getting up there.
Come on, we're needed.
I don't want to hurt you anymore, Caldwell.
But, I must have the plans.
Algy.
You'll never learn anything about life through a key hole.
What?
Thanks, old boy.
Come along, Caldwell, what did you do with them?
I destroyed them.
Do you expect me to believe that?
It's the truth, do you think
I'd keep plans like that?
Well, he can redraw them.
I won't.
I won't do it.
You hear me?
You can do what you like to me, but I won't.
All right, sweetheart.
You've asked for it.
Oh!
Do you wanna kill him?
A dead man can't talk.
You see, you're getting nowhere this way?
Yeah, but we've got...
What do you suggest?
Get him back to Cranloch.
What for?
Then we can give him the works just the way we want.
Perhaps you're right.
You stay here with him, Veight.
Veight, get a car for Miss Thompson.
Get in touch with Kalinsky and tell him, we're compelled to take
Caldwell back to Cranloch, but don't tell him why, understand?
Sure.
Get him to think the
Scots express in the morning and you go to Cranloch with him.
Who pays the fair?
Kalinsky of course.
Yeah, yeah.
I know those millionaires.
I'll take Caldwell up by car tonight and wait for her.
And don't slip up on this.
I'll attend to everything, including Kalinsky.
All clear.
You're not going in.
Why not?
But there may be a gang of thugs in there.
That's what I'm gonna find out.
You can count me in, old boy.
Nothing doing.
On guard, Algy.
I shout, come in, if I don't stay out.
Good.
Look out!
What are you doing here?
Well, you see, it's like this.
If he calls me, I'm to go in.
If he doesn't I'm to stay out.
You'll stay out.
Algy!
Algy!
Meredith, bring in
Captain Drummond's Algy.
I don't know how you and your friend got in here, Mr Drummond, but you're gonna have a much harder time getting out.
Did you enjoy your ride, Mr Drummond?
Shall we say so long?
Auf Wiedersehen?
Or just good bye?
I'll take that.
Put Caldwell in the car.
Help him, Meredith.
All right, Doctor.
Good night, Mr Drummond.
I'll be seeing you.
I wouldn't be too sure of that.
Sorry, you can't join us, Captain Drummond.
That man's dangerous.
Not now.
My mother said I'd never live to a ripe old age.
Who wants to?
These people do things well.
They certainly do.
My jaw aches.
You exercise it too much.
Peace, like war, needs sacrifice.
No, no killing.
We must kill, Doctor.
For as long as these two men are alive, there can be no peace.
Now, have you forgotten our cause?
The Key Club?
Our sacred trust.
Don't you realise that these men would ruin our plans?
The secret Caldwell is holding from us must be revealed for the sake of peace in Europe.
For the peace of the world.
I'd give my life for it.
Then why not theirs?
No, there must be no violence.
But gas isn't violent.
It's slow, gentle, quiet.
Look, Doctor, don't you remember when we tested that last gas formula the club bought?
How quiet everything was in the laboratory when we came back?
How very quiet?
Huh, Doctor, huh?
Two.
Alcohol.
Oh, alcohol.
We're in a pretty tight fix, Algy.
It might be worse.
Stop twittering.
Twittering, I resent that, I never twitter. well, I'll be.
Budgerigars.
Lovebirds, very fond of necking, aren't they?
They're happy.
At peace.
That's queer, he's dead.
Poor little fella.
Quiet and peaceful now, isn't it?
I tell you, Doctor, you and I have struck a blow for peace tonight, that'll resound through history.
Let us hope now, that nothing can hinder the cause.
Absolutely nothing.
Enjoy a good night's sleep, Doctor.
Good night.
I suppose the poor little blighters had to peg out some time.
Look, another one.
And always from the lowest perch.
Gas, heavier than air and it's rising steadily like water.
Dear old boy.
Hello.
I'm sorry, Dr Belfrus has retired.
Good night.
Every inch airtight.
Tight, tight, who's tight?
What's that?
Cotton waste.
Oh, I know sailors wind it round their big toes.
Cotton.
Were you ever at school?
The best in the country,
I've had them all.
Did you ever do stinks?
I say, really old boy.
Oh, you mean chemistry.
Did you ever make gun cotton?
Never made a thing in my life.
Well, you're gonna make some now.
Help me with this.
Get me the nitric acid.
Hardly my kind of beverage.
What are you doing, writing home?
The action of those two acids on cotton waste gives us C6H702NO83.
Gun cotton.
Enough to blow our way out of here.
We're in time.
Are we to be present during the fireworks?
We are.
I would prefer to die in one piece.
However.
How's the tide, Algy?
Rising rapidly, old boy.
We may have to finish this job out of our depth.
Pity we can't float on the stuff.
I'm so good at floating.
This will help in a pinch.
And yours old boy?
There's only one.
And you think I'd better use it?
Sure.
You're jolly well mistaken.
Perhaps one of the lady lovebirds will like it.
How do you tell which for which?
If we ever get out of here,
I'll tell you the facts of life.
Oh.
Good evening, governor.
You remember me, Davenport?
Yes.
Well, may I come in?
I'm tired.
Would you be good enough to state your business?
Certainly.
Two of my friends came here this evening and they haven't returned so I thought perhaps they might have stayed on.
No, there's no one here.
Mind if I have a look?
Look, I told you there's no one in the house.
Well, then you won't mind if
I have a look 'round do you?
Either you leave the house immediately or I call the police.
Police, hey?
Yes.
Yes, operator.
Give me the police.
What happens next?
We'll sit and wait for it to dry.
How's the tide?
Great scot, quick, let's save the birdies.
We'll have to make a split for it.
Keep your head well up, Algy.
I should be all tiptoed in a minute.
Pity I'm not a ballet dancer.
And despite the fact that there is no one here, this man, Major Grayson,
Intelligence department.
If you have nothing to hide, why not let us search the place?
Sorry, can't do that, sir, we've not search warrant.
I'd welcome a search now that authority is here.
You invite us to search your house?
Well by all means.
Come along.
We've gotta wait a while now.
Let's keep that mask handy.
I'll stand on the counter.
And by the way, in case of accident, do you mind if I shake your hand?
Not at all.
Are you satisfied now, sir?
Yes.
I demand an apology.
And let me tell you, sir,
I resent your attitude, your interference, your suspicion, intolerable.
I'm sorry, Doctor,
I must've been mistaken.
Well, then you...
But I'm still worried about my friends, Drummond.
Did you say Drummond?
Yes, Captain Drummond.
Have I been looking for Drummond?
Well, that settles it.
Come on.
I don't want to hear anymore, Captain Drummond.
Good night.
Nice and soothing, sir?
Hmm.
Morning, sir.
This going to be long?
Just finishing.
Too close a shave, sir?
Don't worry, I'm used to it.
I advise you to have a mudpack put on that mug of yours.
Permanently for preference.
Hurry up, Joel.
On the way, madam.
Have you a cigarette?
If anyone had told me I should've enjoyed this journey to Scotland.
You dislike travelling?
It all depends upon my company.
Beer, Charlie.
Yes, sir.
And in flew a dead duck.
Well, good morning.
Mr Kalinsky, this is Captain Drummond.
How do you do?
Very pleased to meet you.
Will you join us in a drink?
No, thank you.
Just lately I've learned to be very careful about what I drink.
Your beer, sir.
Well, happy landing.
Do you go to Scotland often?
Not as often as I should like.
Grand place, thought I'd slip out for a breath of fresh air.
I need it.
And a shooting?
I may have to do quite a lot of shooting.
I hear the birds are in fine condition.
I've taken every care of it.
Oh, Charlie, my travelling companions.
They're a honeymoon couple.
So you're a bird fancier, Captain Drummond.
In Scotland it's my firm intention to kill two birds with one stone.
You're very ambitious.
Well, if you'll excuse me I have a few matters to attend to.
I hope to see you in a few minutes.
I'll come to your compartment.
Keep the change.
An amusing little playmate.
Quite.
Cigarette?
They're quite harmless.
Thanks, just the same.
But I have to be very careful of what I smoke.
There's a gentleman, named Drummond on the train.
Hmm?
Gentleman named Drummond interfered with your plans once before, I remember.
You must see to it that he doesn't interfere a third time, Conrad.
What do you suggest?
There's a short tunnel further up the line.
Keep away from Kalinsky, please.
But we've only just met.
Oh, I'm not joking.
Don't try to follow him.
If he asks you to go to his carriage, don't go, please.
Why this sudden solicitude for my welfare.
Put it down to my conscience anything you like.
But take what I say seriously.
I take you very seriously.
And Kalinsky takes you very seriously.
Well, it's arranged, but I think it might be safer if we took his gun away from him first.
You'd better go to the bar and buy yourself a drink.
Smart, governor.
And you'll need this.
My dear girl, nothing on earth could stop me going to Scotland.
I hope to see quite a lot of you and your friends there.
We shall see.
Quite a lot of each other, I hope.
Watch out for yourself on the train.
Once you're off, I'll fix everything.
Good bye, Hugh.
Let's see those lovebirds, Charlie.
Yes sir.
Pretty little things, aren't they?
Lovebirds give me a pain in the neck, I'm married.
- Gin and mix.
- Yes sir.
Ow!
Funny how these folk dancers seem to be catching on.
You're okay, sir?
You sure nothing can go wrong?
Pete'll deal with him.
Nothing will be heard.
There'll be plenty of noise in the tunnel.
Can he approach without raising suspicion?
You leave it to Pete, he knows his job.
Arrangements are being made.
And we can look forward to a quiet little holiday at Cranloch.
Look out, here he comes.
Your beer sir.
Give it over here.
Excuse me sir.
Give us his coat, quick!
Hurry up.
May I come in?
Why certainly.
Thank you.
I think there's a tunnel coming.
Only a very short one.
Calton.
It may sound silly, but they make me terribly afraid.
Won't you have a smoke?
Nothing like tobacco for the nerves.
That's right.
Afraid I haven't a match.
Here's the steward.
Oh, steward, give the lady a light please.
Anything else, sir?
Not for the moment, thank you.
What are you reading?
My favourite fiction, crime.
Marches on.
Hey, hey what's the matter with you?
Help, help.
Help, help, help.
Are you crazy?
Hello, hello, hello, another cow on the line.
Hello, she stopped.
That's not usual here is it?
No, sir.
No one's safe with a man like that.
He ought to be shot.
You said it, lady.
I shall have to detain you until the police meet the train at Edinburgh.
You can charge him there, Miss.
This is disgraceful.
You poor child.
Drummond, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.
Will you come along, sir?
Certainly.
Now I'll come quietly.
Are you all right?
Yes, yes, I'm all right.
That was neat.
Very clever of you.
Hm?
Getting him off the train.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
And to think he goes around with lovebirds.
Looking forward to our stay in Cranloch and you?
Very much.
Sorry we should be so numerous.
First time so many of my assistants will be gathered in one place.
I've given instructions that will ensure privacy for you and me.
Everyone enjoys privacy.
Except in prison.
Let me out of here.
It's urgent, vital.
You tell that to the court in the morning.
But I've got to get to
Cranloch on important business.
Is everyone here?
Everyone.
You've obeyed my last instruction?
Pete's arranged everything.
And Caldwell?
He's upstairs.
All right, we see him first.
Come on.
So, you're Caldwell.
And he's very stubborn.
He's a Scotsman, I think I can make him more reasonable.
Let me try.
I know it's tough, Caldwell.
Think it over, carefully.
They'll wait.
We'll give you ample time.
Miss Thompson knows that I can wait.
I don't care about myself.
You can kill me, but what are you gonna do to my mother?
His mother's here?
We found it advisable to detain Mrs Caldwell and we occupied Cranloch and took Caldwell away.
Send for her.
Leave me here with him until his mother comes.
You know.
Yes, but look here.
A woman can talk to a woman.
He's our trump card.
If that fails, he'd do anything rather than...
Rather than see her put to any discomfort.
If I were you, I'd keep an eye on our good friend, Gregoroff.
Oh?
Why?
Just that.
Nevermind what's happened, Caldwell.
All I want you to know is that you can trust me.
You know very well that line's dead.
Is there any other way of sending a message?
No.
This way, madam.
Now, listen Mrs Caldwell.
Just a minute
What's the matter?
You're to keep out of this.
I'm to keep...
Kalinsky's orders.
Through you?
Through me.
Thanks.
Say, sweetheart, I just had a little surprise.
Did you tell that girl to give me orders?
I did.
If you'll only do as I ask, there'll be no more trouble, I promise you.
Just stall for time, I'll take care of the rest.
Looks like things are changing around here.
They are, Gregoroff.
You've bundled this job every inch of the way.
Thanks.
Now she's gonna take over, huh?
Exactly.
So, you fall for her and try and throw me out.
You're getting pretty big, aren't you, Kalinsky?
I'm big enough to give orders.
Well, don't get too big.
He's ready to talk, and if you don't mind I don't want to be present.
Neither of you have anything to fear.
Make him tell them what they want to know.
I leave them to you.
And don't bundle it this time.
So that was what he was charged with.
Ay, that was it.
Well, I've always heard the air in Scotland is very bracing but by Jove.
Hugh.
The sergeant's just been telling me, fie on you, fie.
Are you bailing me out?
There'll be no need for that, Captain Drummond.
The charge has been withdrawn.
What?
You got a car here?
Dear old boy, you don't think I walked.
Come on.
Where to?
Cranloch castle.
Hey, you're forgetting your lovebirds.
Let her go!
I'm afraid we'll need her.
Unless you talk.
Well, are you gonna tell us?
Well, and what happened then?
Well, we trailed him as far as Edinburgh and then he vanished.
Come in.
There you are.
Cranloch Castle.
The whole lot of them.
Is that the home office?
Give me the emergency department, Scottish division.
And what about Drummond.
Oh, don't worry about him, he can take care of himself.
We're doing 90.
Step on it, old boy, don't loiter.
Good, Doris.
Do you mind?
I'll open a window.
That thing's likely to go off.
Whew.
I got dizzy looking down there.
I thought I was dizzy enough.
In the old days people used to build their houses high in the mountains to protect them from their enemies.
Everyone has enemies.
Are you sure you've built your house high enough?
Hm, I think so.
You only have one enemy to fear.
Well, as soon as Caldwell talks,
I shall have no use for Gregoroff.
There's plenty of time.
Here's how.
Time's up, Caldwell, take his mother away.
What are you gonna do to her?
Alec.
Stop, I'll tell you what you want to know.
Yes?
I haven't got any plans.
I destroyed them.
You what?
You see, when I built the plane...
Where is the plane?
Chateau Lafite 1920.
An incomparable wine soft as silk.
Exquisite bouquet.
A wine for lovers.
To the success of our venture.
I'll drink to that.
Listen, Kalinsky.
I shall have to teach you manners one day.
I'm here on business.
Caldwell's come across.
- And?
The plane's down the valley of Secret Hanger, all tuned up and ready to go.
Let's be on our way, you can have your tete-a-tete later.
I give orders, I don't take them.
You'd better remember that, Gregoroff.
I'm gonna learn to dislike you.
Come on, cut the girl and let's go.
Run the car undercover and wait for me there.
If you see the girl, try and keep everything under control, old boy.
Why don't you get wise to yourself and stop pushing me around?
You're not important to me.
This girl's kidding you and she's not to be trusted.
I'll ask for your advice when I want it, get out!
You think you can split with her and cut me out of this racket?
You're crazy!
- Get out!
I'm not your dog, Kalinsky, don't you order me around like one.
I've told you once, I'm not gonna tell you again.
Go on, get out!
Why!
Maybe,
I'm not so tough.
And now I guess, I'll settle with you.
You've already settled for what I came for.
What's that?
Kalinsky and you know it.
The only thing I know is
I'm gonna take that plane and you're coming with me, come on.
Oh, no, I'm not.
Then I guess I'll coax you.
All right, if you wanna stay, stay.
I think you'll find it warm enough.
Where's the key to the hanger?
Give it to him, mother.
Thanks.
Look after him, boys.
Where's the boss?
Taking a rest.
Wait here and keep your eyes skinned.
Sure, governor.
Where has he gone?
Caldwell's come across.
Gregoroff's gone to the hanger.
Where's the girl?
Look, I'm choking.
Help, help, let me out!
Get up.
Take me to the hanger and keep your hands well up.
The whole place is alight.
You seen the girl?
Good, God, in the room beyond.
Where's Kalinsky?
Gone.
He took the jump.
That's what I should've let you do.
You poor sap.
But you're awfully nice.
I wanted to keep you out of this.
Catch these birds myself.
But I'm so glad you came anyway.
Stand clear.
But where do I come in all this?
Go back and ask Kalinsky.
It's Gregoroff.
Then he wins.
He can't win, he can't win.
There's still one thing
I haven't told you.
Come on, quick.
You take care of his mother.
What the devil is this?
This is the really secret of my invention.
Then the aeroplane just to bluff.
I'll use that third spin tactically.
When I tell you, throw it in.
Bring it down?
I'm gonna crash it once I can get the range.
Now!
Well, Larry, looks as though your invention's gonna be a great success.
It was quite a simple idea really.
Don't be so secretive about the next one.
Or you'll be getting very unpopular with my department.
And what may I ask is your department?
Oh.
In that case I have to doubly congratulate you.
But I shall be very sorry to lose such a brilliant and charming officer.
Thank you.
Where to, Captain?
London, important business.
Hey, Algy!
Don't tell me, don't tell me.
For once I'm ahead of you.
I bought you a wedding present.
{1892}{1933}Does it look familiar, son?
{1975}{2012}I remember that ridge over there.
{2030}{2110}Yeah. Cowhands ride over there in that big gap.
{2140}{2220}You know, it was right around here where|I picked you up, twelve years ago.
{2252}{2290}You was more dead than alive.
{2348}{2395}I'll never forget that night, Dusty.
{2410}{2495}Flash o' guns, shouts o' murdering men...
{2530}{2562}And the courage of my dad.
{2590}{2668}Shielding me and fighting a hopeless fight.
{2695}{2765}Riddled with bullets, he fell across me, whispering...
{2782}{2868}'Lay still, Ted boy. They'll think you're dead.'
{2925}{2980}He didn't know I had a slug through my lung.
{3020}{3098}Well, when they rode up, somebody lit a match.
{3125}{3158}And I laid still.
{3185}{3268}And I heard somebody say, 'They got 'em both.'
{3292}{3332}And the match died out.
{3372}{3410}And then somebody laughed.
{3428}{3503}I'll never forget that laugh, Dusty.|The laugh of a crazy man.
{3538}{3555}A killer.
{3638}{3690}Well, the next thing I knew, it was morning.
{3725}{3760}I was in your arms.
{3795}{3878}Yep, and I carried you all the way to Big Bend.
{3905}{3980}For two years, I didn't know whether you was|gonna live or die.
{4000}{4040}But you sure pulled through alright.
{4060}{4125}If we could just find some trace of my|kid brother...
{4142}{4182}Well, it's doubtful.
{4202}{4288}We did learn, however, that your dad|had a hired man and his wife.
{4290}{4390}I remember... a woman did the|cooking and took care of Jim.
{4415}{4515}you see, Dusty, my mother died when Jim was born.
{4542}{4592}And he's the only relative I have.
{4605}{4630}If he's alive.
{4635}{4690}That hired man and his wife disappeared.
{4705}{4770}We couldn't find hide nor hair of 'em.
{4792}{4892}Finally, there was a feller that moved on|the ranch by the name of...
{4910}{4945}Let's see... What was his name?
{4985}{5032}Gentry, that's it! Gentry.
{5042}{5070}But he didn't know nothing.
{5100}{5185}Anyway, it ain't gonna do you no good living|this all over again.
{5198}{5260}We'll be in town tomorrow and we'll start|our investigating.
{5472}{5502}Hey, Dusty.
{5895}{5942}Poison!
{5950}{5985}Water hole.
{6028}{6058}I didn't know.
{6910}{6945}I wonder who he is.
{6960}{6988}We better open it.
{7228}{7255}'Hello, Gentry.
{7307}{7348}This'll introduce Gat Ganns.
{7362}{7422}He's just the man for the job you mentioned.
{7445}{7535}Sorry I can't do it, but I got a couple of|star trackers on my tail.
{7555}{7643}Gat's plenty tough, as this enclosed poster will prove.
{7665}{7700}Good luck, Bill.'
{7745}{7770}Gentry.
{7815}{7838}Gentry!
{7845}{7882}He's evidently planning to kill him.
{7893}{7948}Well, that's the fella that's got your dad's ranch!
{8350}{8435}Certainly is funny, but you sure do resemble|this bozo.
{8528}{8602}Maybe fate's kinda taken a hand in this deal, Dusty.
{8612}{8635}Maybe so.
{8658}{8718}We don't know what this Gentry's up to, but...
{8728}{8755}We're gonna find out.
{8762}{8785}What do you mean?
{8798}{8912}I mean that from now on, I'm Gat Ganns.
{8930}{8952}Murderer.
{9062}{9152}Gentry, my daughter and I have considered|your offer for the ranch.
{9162}{9200}And have decided not to sell.
{9215}{9275}We've developed the best spring in the country.
{9288}{9342}And someday I hope to make this a fine ranch.
{9418}{9510}I'll admit it's dry wire, Mr. Winters,|and I don't blame you for holding onto it.
{9522}{9612}However, this country is still wild, and rustlers are pretty numerous.
{9628}{9680}That's why I have sold half the herd.
{9690}{9735}And we're going to sell the other half next week.
{10068}{10138}- Excuse me just a moment, Mr. Gentry.|- Go ahead.
{10318}{10372}- Everything check up alright, Mr. Hornsby?|- Everything's right.
{10385}{10412}They're on their way.
{10562}{10618}I think you'll find that's right, Ms. Winters.
{10750}{10805}That's quite right. Thank you so much,|Mr. Hornsby.
{10835}{10915}Too late for the bank now, Dad. I'll have|to deposit this first thing in the morning.
{10928}{10982}I've got some two-year-olds I'd like|to have you take a look at.
{10995}{11020}Alright!
{11128}{11202}- How do you do, Mr. Gentry?|- Fine. Very happy to see you, Ms. Winters.
{11225}{11290}Your father told me that you decided not to sell.
{11295}{11418}That's right. We're quite happy here, and|it's the kind of a ranch that Dad's always wanted.
{11425}{11455}So why shouldn't we keep it?
{11462}{11528}Well, if you're happy here, that's all that matters.
{11630}{11695}As your neighbor, may I be permitted|to call sometime?
{11708}{11772}Why, of course. Dad and I will be delighted|to have you.
{11782}{11820}- Thank you. Goodbye.|- Goodbye.
{12620}{12652}- Good morning.|- Hello, chief.
{12672}{12700}- Hello.|- Hi, boys.
{12710}{12765}Well, Winters refuses to sell.
{12775}{12832}- Oh, yeah?|- Yeah, but I'm going to force him.
{12840}{12877}I'll ruin him.
{12888}{12960}The Winters girl's leaving the ranch|in the morning with a large sum of money.
{12977}{13060}Now, Joe and Hank, I want you to get it.
{13070}{13125}But remember, no harm must come to her.
{13138}{13198}I'll own that ranch no matter what it costs!
{13325}{13415}- There you are, honey.|- Alright, Dad. Now, I'll be right back.
{13455}{13480}Be careful!
{15408}{15448}If you hadn't have missed her, I'd have got her.
{15455}{15488}Well, it ain't too late yet.
{17520}{17605}- Can't get her now.|- Why didn't you keep her when you had her?
{17620}{17692}We never had her, you lassoed fool!
{18080}{18120}Drop that gun! Are you going crazy?
{18668}{18760}Cool down, now, before I go try it,|you pink-eyed weasel.
{18795}{18852}Come on, get in your saddle. We gotta go tell|the chief.
{19365}{19405}Them fellers is sure in a hurry.
{20005}{20040}Well, I reckon it's deserted.
{20080}{20125}We can camp here temporarily.
{20622}{20660}Dusty, come here.
{20850}{20872}Blood.
{21030}{21078}Hey, son. Get up here, quick!
{21405}{21445}Hey, son.
{21465}{21488}Bullet holes.
{21675}{21765}Fay Winters. It's mighty curious, Dusty.
{21778}{21825}We've gotta hurry and get her to town.
{21835}{21865}Let's take it easy now, son.
{21985}{22010}Got her here just in time.
{22032}{22070}A small artery's been severed.
{22080}{22118}However, I don't think it's very serious.
{22138}{22162}How did this happen?
{22175}{22240}Don't know. We found her just outside of town.
{22260}{22292}A horse must have thrown her.
{22330}{22368}We left our pack running loose.
{22385}{22425}I reckon we better get going.
{22440}{22518}- Yeah, we may be back later.|- Alright, boys.
{22525}{22572}I know the young lady'll be very grateful.
{22580}{22612}You've probably saved her life.
{22795}{22905}Now, listen, I hadn't better be seen around here,|so you take this money down and deposit it for her.
{22910}{22960}- And I'll meet you at the shack.|- Alright.
{23018}{23060}I'll tell you, boss, we couldn't catch her.
{23068}{23110}She just outrode us, that's all.
{23145}{23190}Well, I got another plan.
{23190}{23235}Get back to the hideout. I'll see you tonight.
{23378}{23455}Hello, Winters? This is Dr. Silsby.
{23470}{23550}Your daughter wanted me to tell you|she may be late getting home.
{23560}{23600}She's met with a slight accident.
{23618}{23715}No, not serious. I'll bring her out to the ranch a little later.
{23725}{23745}Thank you.
{23895}{23955}Who were the men that brought me in, Dr. Silsby?
{23968}{24005}They said they were prospectors.
{24020}{24052}It's lucky they found you.
{24065}{24105}A small artery has been severed.
{24118}{24165}And eventually, you may have bled to death.
{24180}{24268}As it is, the way you are, nobody'll ever|know that you have a scratch.
{24292}{24405}I certainly am grateful, but did they say anything about money?
{24410}{24438}Not a word.
{24460}{24525}I had three thousand dollars on me to deposit.
{24535}{24558}And it's gone.
{24572}{24602}Three thousand!
{24805}{24830}Your name Gentry?
{24842}{24870}Yeah, I'm Gentry.
{24878}{24930}We're from the border. Bill said to give you this.
{24968}{25045}He'd have come himself but he had a couple of|star packers on his trail.
{25402}{25450}So, you're Gat Ganns, eh?
{25460}{25490}That's what they call me.
{25512}{25570}- And this is my friend, Dusty.|- Hi.
{25582}{25620}- Howdy.|- We always work together.
{25650}{25685}Bill tell you what I wanted?
{25692}{25750}No, he just said there was gonna be some|gun-throwing.
{25792}{25830}How much do you want for the job?
{25850}{25880}What's the job?
{25905}{25960}There's a fella I wanna have disappear.
{25975}{26052}Well, whatever you're gonna give Bill'll be okay|with us.
{26065}{26102}- Eh, Dusty?|- Yeah.
{26133}{26178}Alright.
{26190}{26235}I'll take you over to meet the boys.
{26970}{27025}- Hello, Mr. Gentry!|- Hello, Spuds.
{27030}{27083}- Where's your dad?|- He's gettin' himself ready for dinner.
{27100}{27165}- Where are the boys?|- They're over at the corral.
{27172}{27255}Hey! Spuds! Spuds, get in here and get to work!
{27270}{27308}Hey, Spuds!
{27338}{27380}Oh, hello, boss.
{27455}{27545}Hey, Butch. I want you to meet Gat Ganns,|and his friend Dusty.
{27567}{27610}- Hiya, boys.|- Hi.
{27620}{27665}These boys have joined up with us for a while.
{27890}{27938}Come on, I want you to meet the rest of the boys.
{28115}{28165}Get in there! Get in there and get to work!
{28275}{28308}Hey, boys.
{28320}{28372}This is Gat Ganns, and his friend Dusty.
{28417}{28455}They're gonna be with us for a while.
{28467}{28510}I've got a little job to do tomorrow night.
{28515}{28565}You boys are taking all of Winters' cattle.
{28575}{28635}Taking 'em through the passe into Round Valley.
{28650}{28725}There's plenty of feed there. We'll dispose o' them later.
{28770}{28815}You boys can watch the house.
{28828}{28883}Winters'll be sure to come out when he hears|the racket.
{28902}{28985}Now, he's the man you want and you know|what to do.
{29002}{29040}Be sure it isn't the girl.
{29070}{29105}We're leaving about midnight.
{29133}{29198}Hank, show the boys to the sleeping quarters.
{29645}{29675}We're out of provisions, chief.
{29680}{29733}Yeah, well, here's fifty bucks.
{29740}{29840}And by the way, Butch. We're taking Winters' cattle|tomorrow night. You better get in on the drive.
{29845}{29885}- I'll be there, chief.|- Okay.
{29945}{30025}- I'm riding back with you, Gentry, to get my pack.|- Okay.
{30302}{30338}Hey, Spuds!
{30370}{30395}Come out here.
{30410}{30478}Tell the boys to hitch up the horses.|You're driving to town for provisions.
{30767}{30828}- Thanks.|- Is that Winters a tough hombre?
{30842}{30945}Just stubborn. I've tried to buy the ranch for|two years. Now I'm taking it.
{30972}{31000}Hasn't he any relatives?
{31010}{31028}A daughter.
{31035}{31067}I'm taking her along with the ranch.
{31080}{31140}Oh, I see! Like a dime novel.
{31150}{31252}We eliminate the old gent. You marry the gal and|get the ranch. Is that it?
{31252}{31285}You guessed it.
{31385}{31485}Go the way you always go. Don't ask any|questions and don't answer any.
{31492}{31550}And if you ain't back by dark, I'll tan you good.
{31558}{31598}- Get going!|- Giddyup!
{32195}{32235}Won't you come in, Dr. Silsby?
{32242}{32295}No, thank you. I got to be getting back.
{32305}{32365}- Well, thanks for the lift.|- Oh, that's alright.
{32455}{32492}Oh, Dad!
{32520}{32552}I lost the money!
{32562}{32633}Nevermind the money, dear. It's you I was worried|about.
{32645}{32720}We've got the rest of the herd to sell. That'll carry|you through til spring.
{32735}{32792}But tell me, Fay. What in the world happened?
{32812}{32865}Well, you see, there was two men that followed |me out of town.
{32902}{32952}And that's the last thing I remember.
{33022}{33085}I don't know. Doc said they were a couple of prospectors.
{36145}{36208}Well, fella, we sure had some ride, didn't we?
{36480}{36548}Come on, son. Let's go sit down and kinda pull|ourselves together.
{36795}{36852}I knowed you was gonna get me when|I passed you.
{36882}{36945}Oh, don't worry, Spuds. We're alright.
{36955}{36998}You're safe.
{37005}{37062}I know. But that's not what I'm thinkin' about.
{37082}{37142}I'm thinkin' o' what's gonna happen to me when I get back.
{37155}{37178}Butch'll beat me.
{37185}{37225}Oh, I'll have something to say about that.
{37240}{37322}You can't stop him. No one can. They have tried it.
{37330}{37405}Well, I'll get your provisions and then go back|with you and explain things.
{37422}{37478}Don't worry. Your dad isn't gonna whip you.
{38040}{38128}Now, I was beginning to think I'd have to come in|after you.
{38235}{38280}Where are the buckboards? What happened?
{38290}{38378}The horses got scared. I managed to stop them,|but the buckboards got wrecked.
{38385}{38418}What about the provisions?
{38425}{38448}They're in my pack.
{38495}{38522}Here's your change.
{38552}{38572}Get in the house.
{38670}{38728}I told 'em that kid couldn't hold them horses.
{38750}{38815}I've seen that fella someplace before, Dusty.
{38845}{38895}But I can't think where.
{38982}{39055}I couldn't help it, I swear! I tell you, I couldn't!
{39185}{39235}- I'll tan you good --|- I couldn't help it! No, please! Stop!
{39252}{39285}- I'll take care of --|- Stop, please!
{39500}{39532}I've'd licked the rest of 'em.
{39560}{39595}Now I reckon it's just --
{40058}{40092}Come on, Ted!
{41035}{41100}You ever whip that kid again,|I'll break every bone in your carcass.
{41112}{41162}Oh. Alright, then. Let me go.
{41378}{41425}He won't whip you again, Spuds.
{41435}{41470}You're the only friend I've got.
{41480}{41508}Gee, you can fight!
{41520}{41560}I'm gonna bet you busted his gizzards!
{41700}{41765}Gentry sent word that no one was to leave|the ranch.
{41778}{41818}And tonight's the night we're supposed|to get Winters.
{41835}{41862}How we gonna warn him?
{41870}{41935}Well, the only chance we got's when we get there.
{42025}{42040}Move over to the house from here.
{42062}{42122}But, remember. Don't mistake the girl for the man.
{42135}{42175}I'll get the boys started on the drive.
{42380}{42410}Gimme your knife, Dusty.
{45145}{45190}- What's wrong, Fay?|- Come here, Dad.
{45285}{45305}Look!
{45330}{45358}This just came through the window.
{45438}{45490}Why, it's our bank book!
{45510}{45545}The lost money has been deposited!
{45720}{45780}'Don't come... Don't strike a light.
{45788}{45830}They're waiting to shoot you down.
{45838}{45885}Your life's worth more than your cattle.
{45892}{45935}Let them take them. A Friend.'
{45978}{46010}They're stealing our cattle.
{46022}{46045}- I can't let --|- Dad!
{46055}{46080}Don't you understand?
{46092}{46152}They're waiting out there for you.|You wouldn't have a chance.
{47652}{47680}I saw the flash of a light.
{47705}{47740}I'm sure they got the note.
{47980}{48020}I don't think there's anybody home!
{48055}{48175}Well, that's mighty strange.|Well, I've got the cattle anyway. Let's go.
{48280}{48308}They're gone.
{48318}{48350}And our cattle with them.
{48395}{48515}Don't worry, Dad. Thanks to someone|we've got enough in the bank to carry us through.
{48635}{48685}Go over to Winters and ask him for a job.
{48695}{48780}He'll tell you about the cattle being stolen.|Tell him you'll help trail them.
{48798}{48835}I'm sure he'll take you up.
{48860}{48945}When you get out of town, well...
{48955}{48982}Accidents happen.
{49010}{49060}That's a mighty smart idea, Gentry.
{49080}{49122}You sure know how to work things out.
{49145}{49198}Now, come on, Dusty. Let's get this over with.
{50015}{50045}Oh, how are you?
{50055}{50085}I reckon you're the owner here.
{50092}{50162}- Yes, I am.|- Could you use a couple of good cowhands?
{50188}{50225}Well, I could've used you last night.
{50238}{50278}Rustlers run off all my cattle.
{50345}{50380}Well, they couldn't have gone far.
{50400}{50428}Cattle has to eat, you know.
{50445}{50470}Why don't you trail him?
{50480}{50552}I've phoned the sheriff, but he won't be back|til this afternoon.
{50578}{50620}Well, we'll make you a little proposition.
{50638}{50730}If we bring your herd back, will you give us|our jobs taking care of it?
{50748}{50770}I sure will.
{50782}{50865}Well, that's fair enough. You better go with us|til we sight 'em.
{50880}{50920}Then you can come back and get the sheriff.
{50935}{51015}We may lose your rustlers, but we'll sure|get your cattle.
{51022}{51065}Alright, I'll saddle up right away.
{51190}{51212}Oh, Ms. Winters...
{51240}{51278}- Oh, good morning, Mr. Gentry.|- Good morning.
{51285}{51308}Is your dad around?
{51315}{51365}Why, yes. I think he's over at the barn.
{51378}{51420}- I'd like to see him.|- Alright.
{51653}{51703}- Good morning, Gentry.|- Good morning, Mr. Winters.
{51715}{51820}Rustlers run off my cattle last night, and I've|just hired these two boys to help trail him.
{51915}{51950}We'll take care of him, Ms. Winters.
{51975}{52040}When we sight the cattle, he's coming back|after the sheriff.
{52075}{52122}Oh! Oh, I see!
{52442}{52528}Don't worry, dear. I may be late getting back,|but I'll be here.
{52608}{52635}Good luck.
{52792}{52840}Oh, I do hope they find our cattle!
{52860}{52982}In case your dad is late getting back, I'd be very happy|to keep you company this evening until his return.
{53000}{53085}Thank you, but I'm not afraid.|And I wouldn't like to inconvenience you.
{53092}{53155}Oh, that wouldn't be an inconvenience,|Ms. Winters.
{53168}{53218}In fact, it's going to be a real pleasure.
{53295}{53345}And here's the letter we got from Ganns.
{53438}{53520}'Hello, Gentry. This will introduce Gat Ganns.
{53530}{53578}He's just the man for the job you mentioned.
{53588}{53662}Sorry I can't do it, but I got a couple of|star packers on my trail.
{53680}{53765}Gat's plenty tough, as the enclosed poster|will prove.
{53770}{53792}Good luck. Bill.'
{53830}{53860}Gentry!
{53880}{53918}That dirty smick!
{53938}{53988}I don't know how I can ever repay you boys.
{53997}{54068}I hate to think what would've happened if you|hadn't taken a hand in this.
{54068}{54115}Oh, gosh, Mr. Winters. We're glad to help you.
{54128}{54170}The question is what to do next.
{54215}{54240}I got it!
{54250}{54322}You go tell Gentry that we've disposed|of Mr. Winters here.
{54342}{54415}If he wants proof, take him and show him Ganns.
{54500}{54530}And then...
{54568}{54625}Alright, get outta here before I shoot|the pants offa you.
{57032}{57112}- Well, Dusty's taken the shovel, but I guess|I can...|- Nevermind that.
{57125}{57147}Where is your partner?
{57155}{57240}He beat it for the border. We figure that the|sooner we get outta here, the better.
{57255}{57285}And I suppose you want your dough.
{57297}{57338}That's all I'm waiting for.
{57355}{57445}Well, the bank's closed, but I'll have it for you|at the hideout first thing in the morning.
{57455}{57518}Fair enough. I'll stay at the Winters' place tonight.
{57530}{57570}Got a few things I wanna pick up.
{57580}{57625}Alright, but don't let the girl see you.
{57632}{57668}I won't let anyone see me.
{57688}{57708}Okay.
{58328}{58365}- Hello, boys.|- Hi, boss. Hi, chief.
{58375}{58412}Well, I got some good news for you.
{58468}{58515}The Winters' ranch'll soon be mine.
{58540}{58597}Ol' man Winters is dead.
{58622}{58710}- Well, that is good news, I'd say.|- I'll say it is, boys.
{58720}{58770}Wonder what happened to him.
{58915}{58982}And now we're gonna collect five thousand dollars|reward.
{58990}{59022}- Five thousand?|- How?
{59032}{59118}Gat Ganns is at the Winters' ranch,|but he'll be over here in the morning.
{59128}{59210}There's a price on his head of|five thousand dollars, dead or alive.
{59235}{59330}- Dead men tell no tales.|- That's my job.
{59340}{59408}I don't care who does the job, just so it's done.
{59575}{59635}Peewee, you're gonna fly your tail outta here!
{59650}{59718}They're laying plots and it's up to us to tell 'em!
{60997}{61050}Why, Spuds! What're you doin' over here?
{61055}{61125}I come to tell you, they're gonna shoot you,|soon's you come to the hideout!
{61135}{61195}Gentry says there's a reward for you and he's|gonna get it.
{61218}{61247}Double-crossed, eh?
{61278}{61385}Oh, you don't have to worry, Spuds. There's no|reward out for me, and they're not gonna get me.
{61418}{61428}What's that?
{61445}{61470}That was Aunt Marthy's.
{61503}{61542}She gave it to me when she died.
{61565}{61575}Marthy?
{61603}{61715}Yeah, she was Butch's wife. She was the only|friend I had until you come.
{61725}{61750}Marthy, Butch...
{61772}{61847}Now I know where I've seen 'em. He and his|wife worked for my dad!
{61875}{61965}Say, Spuds. Did Aunt Martha ever tell you|about your father?
{61982}{62040}She said he was dead and that Butch wasn't|my real dad.
{62055}{62130}She left me a letter and told me not to open|it until I was grown up.
{62140}{62160}Well, where is it?
{62172}{62275}I brought this with me, 'cause Butch said he was|gonna shoot me and I ain't never going back there.
{62375}{62392}Here it is.
{62432}{62525}I'm gonna open this, Spuds. It may mean a lot|to both of us.
{62735}{62805}'Dear boy, your real name is Jim Hayden.
{62842}{62940}Your dad and his brother were killed by Gentry|and his gang when you were a babe.
{62958}{63025}Don't think hard of me, son. I've had no hand|in this.
{63038}{63055}Aunt Martha.'
{63147}{63215}Jim!
{63225}{63258}Jim, do you know what that means?
{63292}{63325}It means you're my brother.
{63375}{63400}My own little brother.
{63420}{63465}Gee, ain't that swell!
{63615}{63703}You know, boys, in a way this isn't any great|surprise to me.
{63732}{63790}I've suspicioned Gentry for a long time.
{63805}{63850}But I've never been able to get anything on him.
{63885}{63942}Years ago, right after Hayden was killed...
{63970}{64055}We suspected him of being the secret leader|of a band of rustlers.
{64072}{64108}But we were never able to prove it.
{64140}{64220}After reading that letter, there isn't a doubt|in my mind...
{64232}{64290}... but that he was guilty of Hayden's death.
{64332}{64375}We've got enough on Gentry now!
{64385}{64408}Why should we wait?
{64415}{64465}Well, give Ted a chance to play his hand, Sheriff.
{64485}{64530}He'll get word to us when he needs us.
{64660}{64695}There's Gentry now.
{65135}{65220}No matter what happens, son, stay right here.
{65368}{65395}Mrs. Winters?
{65512}{65612}I hardly know how to tell you, but...|this poster will speak for itself.
{65788}{65860}Why! That's the man that went with Dad!
{65875}{65935}- And he's a killer!|- That isn't the worst of it.
{65945}{66015}Word just came to town that they found|your father --
{66025}{66042}No!
{66060}{66092}Don't say it!
{66112}{66210}Don't cry, Fay. I want you to know that I'll take|care of you.
{66220}{66295}Why, I've loved you since the first time I saw you.
{66318}{66400}- Please, Mr. Gentry --|- Don't you understand, Fay? I'm crazy about you!
{66410}{66432}I'll give you everything you want!
{66445}{66485}Please don't talk like that!
{66495}{66562}Listen. I want you to be my wife.
{66570}{66602}Oh, take your hands off me!
{66612}{66650}Take your hands off, Gentry.
{66688}{66758}- You!|- What have you done with my father?
{66778}{66815}Your father's safe, Ms. Winters.
{66825}{66908}Call the sheriff. I'm holding this man for murder.
{66925}{66955}Murder?
{66975}{67025}My name's Hayden. Ted Hayden.
{67045}{67122}Son of the man you and your gang murdered|twelve years ago.
{67130}{67188}You left me for dead, too, Gentry.
{67198}{67222}But I lived.
{67235}{67275}Lived to even up the score.
{67295}{67335}Why, he's crazy!
{67345}{67375}That poster proves who he is.
{67388}{67435}Then call the sheriff, Ms. Winters.
{67795}{67812}Hello?
{67820}{67845}No, give me the sheriff's office.
{68008}{68060}You're mighty brave behind a gun, aren't you?
{68078}{68162}Why, hangin' or shootin's too good for you,|Gentry.
{68452}{68480}Hello, is this the sheriff's office?
{68505}{68600}- This is Ms. Winters. Is my fath --?|- Yes, your father's here.
{68618}{68642}He's alright.
{68690}{68708}What's that?
{68760}{68778}We'll be right over.
{68808}{68855}It's your daughter, Winters. We'll have to hurry.
{72360}{72418}- When Dusty comes, lead 'em right|to the hideout.|- Alright, Ted!
{73248}{73295}I'll be alright, dear. Don't you worry.
{73390}{73442}Hey, Dusty! Ted said to follow me!
{73450}{73478}Come on, Winters!
{75300}{75350}It's Ganns. He's got himself in a trap.
{75360}{75378}Gimme that gun.
{75600}{75692}Listen, Gentry. Twelve years ago,|you killed my father.
{75705}{75795}Separated me from my brother and took|everything outta my life that a kid could have.
{75810}{75865}You know, I oughtta give you what|you gave my dad.
{75888}{75940}But I'm keeping my hands clean, Gentry.
{75958}{75992}I'm taking you to the law.
{76058}{76110}Alright, boys. Let's riddle him with bullets.
{76338}{76362}Why, it's Gentry!
{76770}{76790}Up in the air, men!
{76820}{76865}Where's the man called Ganns?
{76880}{76898}He's in there.
{77045}{77160}Well, boys! I've been tryin' to meet up with you|for sometime!
{77310}{77385}I reckon you got here just in time, brother.
{77598}{77630}What're you thinking about, Jim?
{77655}{77685}You know, Ted meant that.
{77698}{77795}And he said when you married 'em,|it was gonna be twice as big.
{77812}{77865}Oh! He has it all worked out, has he?
{77875}{77932}Sure, and you better accept his proposition.
{77948}{77988}'Cause it'll be the only one you'll ever get.
{78008}{78040}Well!
{78075}{78122}What's my little brother been tellin' you?
{78182}{78260}Well, I was tellin' her what you said you didn't|have the nerve to.
{78362}{78392}Is my face red!
{78400}{78502}Well, it oughtn't to be! 'Cause Fay said she'd|accept your proposition.
{78532}{78565}Why, I --
{78575}{78618}Gosh, now you're both burnin' up.
{78645}{78700}I think your brother needs a good lecture.
{78708}{78770}Lecture? He needs a good spanking!
Martial...I was just gonna apply for a job.
Its all right son. My deputy just gone down there with all the men we need.
What's all the trouble, Martial ?
Who is he ?
Boys, get that man. I want him.
Wait a minute. I will get him.
Watch this fella.
Well Martial, I guess you got me ... but I was not mixed up with that gang
...I was trying to help you.
-You darn fool.. I noted.
I just wanted to talk to you when you lead out.
I got a job for you and it ain't fighting fire with others.
Say, I been looking for a fellow that can shoot, ride like you for months.
Think I am going to let you get away ?
No Sire...
Take a look at this.
-What's wrong with that ?
-Nothing maybe .. it might be funny to me that every time this gang organizes Rodeo
...their own men win all the first prizes.
Once it begins to look like an outsider was going to win, he gets sick.. two or three has even died from it.
-cannot arrest them for that, Martial.
-no, maybe not.
... but its mighty peculiar ... that when all these outsiders fall fall off from them tough horses suffering from snakebites. I tell you it ain't natural. what do you want me to do, get snake bit ?
No, my idea is for you to trail over there and sign up for the Rodeo.
I will come along after and do some private investigating.
...while you work in on the gang. cause you don't have to know me when we get there.
-what do you say to that son ?
-sounds great to me.
-when do we start ?
-right away. this game is getting pretty hot for us.
If we are tiring the law to figure out something crooked with this whole Rodeo business they will start investigating.
Now I will decide when we make our next clean up right here in Dalton. head for the border... before something happens we will stick up the next stage of the mine grab the rodeo receipt, and clear out. you are right spike. they acted mighty suspicious when that fella died over the boulder
-when do we start ?
-Tomorrow.
Dolores will board the stage, down at sagebrush and give you boys a high sign when the money is aboard women passengers as a stage crew ain't liable to fight much anyhow
.well, well Cramer. meet my new deputy John Weston.
I want you to paddle west with the shortcut trail the one that leads to Dalton. save him a whole days journey, if he had to go on the way over the desert. give him a horse. I will see that another is sent to you.
-sure thing.
-you better get going then, right now. the trail starts outside the corral, cant get off of it. then you go 14 miles straight through the mountain that will drop you right out of the timber on the main stage road that leads to Dalton.
Howdy Miss Carter, going home for the big round up ?
-Oh yes! I promised Dad that I will be there.
-I bet, he will be mighty glad to see you.
I will be glad to see him too.
-Pardon me. Do you mind if I sit on this side?
-Well, certainly not. Its quiet alright. looks like we are getting some help from back there. you sure got us out of the jam, that time stranger. nice riding. you don't happen to be going to the Dalton Rodeo... do you ?
-Yes I am.
- Well tie your horse on behind and ride in with us. thanks, I will do that. that was very fine of you to come to our rescue.. Mr.. ....
Weston Mam.
John Weston from Utah.
I came over for the rodeo ...
...I saw your distress signal from the top of the ridge.. when I saw all those men riding behind,
I thought I better come down and investigate.
-My distress signal ?
-it was mine.
I saw the men coming and waved for help. that was kind of an unusual place to expect help, wasn't it ?
-I saw you on the ridge.
-Oh, I see.
-Are you going to Dalton mam ?
-Yes, I am Margaret Carter.
...my father is Judge Carter. president of the county news bank of Dalton...
I want you to meet him when we get there. he will want to thank you too.
You see the bank had a large shipment of money on this stage.
Yeah. there were about 50 of them. but this fella from Utah comes along single-handed and knocks them all off the horses.
I have never seen such riding. can you tell me where I can find Weston ?
-Just went in the bank there, Mr. Carter.
-Thank You.
Hello Miss. Carter.
This is Mr. Weston.. the man who saved us from the bandits.
Mr. Weston. my father ...Judge Carter. mighty fine piece of work, young man.
I hope you are staying in Dalton.
-Yes. I am going to enter the rodeo.
-that's fine.
Drop into my office after you get settled.
I like to have a talk with you. thank you, I will be glad to.
-you cant blame me if your men cant take care of him. she is right. just out-smarted you that's all.
I don't like the looks of it. he came up behind us and took the boys off there horses. he said he will enter the rodeo.
-we are going to have to take care of him. he is liable to spoil our plans.
-hey, young man.
-hello Judge.
-come in.
- thank you.
Miss Carter !
- How do you do ? as justice of the peace of this township,
I have been doing a little investigating. and it appears to me that this rodeo gang ain't just not exactly on the level. if it ain't, we are going to need all the good men we can get on the side of law and order. it would be mighty disastrous son, if anything happens to this rodeo. nearly all the money in this valley is tied up in it.
... so we just got to keep it honest. you mean to say that these people have tied up all the money in the valley on a proposition put on by outsiders ? yes, every cent. they think that it will bring people and prosperity to Dalton. and they are all mighty proud of this little valley. that's why I am offering you the job of Deputy Sheriff.
I figure, that with a man like you representing us they wont dare to pull any of their tricks. well, I appreciate your confidence in me Judge, but I couldn't accept. it will interfere with my plans.
- plans ! what plans ?
My plans to enter the rodeo, tomorrow.
- Oh ! I see. Well I am sorry young man... so am I judge.
Good day Miss Carter.
- I am afraid I was talking to the wrong man.
- I think he is nice.
Ladies and Gentlemen ! it gives me great pleasure to announce the first annual Dalton rally roundup. two days of Bronc riding
... consisting of riding, roping and horsemanship featuring Dynamite, the only unridden horse in the play better be careful son. many of them have lost their lives making up with this thing.
Oh, I don't think they will try anything today. by tomorrow, I may have this thing figured out for you
I hope so, but I still say you ought to be careful. next on the program, ladies and gentlemen .. will be the trick roping contest. featuring Jack Hollister. the next event ladies and gentlemen will be the roman standing race. next ladies and gentlemen we introduce the world-renowned holder of all championships
...Cheyenne Kent and the cub roping contest. let her go ! new record in this contest, ladies and gentlemen..
Kent's time was 15 seconds flat. its a brave try but Kent's record still stands. however we have a dark horse with us today.
A man from Utah will try his luck. let him loose ! a new world record, ladies and gentlemen! the man from Utah rode and tied his cub in 14 seconds flat. that one got away!
...better luck next time... that's 3 events taken in a day, the one from Utah ! he looks like holding to me. yeah! we got to do something about it.
I don't want to pull anything too rough unless we have to.
Kent, you take the boys up into the cabin and Dolores will get him up there. just work over him gently. leave that for us.
-are you ready ?
-let her loose.
Dolores, the young girl that you met on the stage was in the gang from the beginning. play up to her and see what you can find out.
I will meet you in the saloon tonight. that concludes today's event, ladies and gentlemen.
Don't forget, tomorrow is the big day.
-Oh, you were wonderful.
-thanks Miss. that means lot coming from you.
I like you to come to the house for dinner tonight.
I told father that maybe you can get you to reconsider the offer. we need somebody like you.
Oh, Mr. Weston. It was wonderful the way you win today. my brother is a big Rodeo star also. and he would like to meet you.
..wont you come now ?
- well .... I ....
Yes. goodbye Miss. Carter!
I will see you tomorrow.
-here they come Kent !
-you boys get out at the back. this is my brother, Cheyenne Kent.
-how do you do Kent.
-pleased that you have accepted our hospitality.
-sit down, Dolores will fix us a drink.
-thanks.
I must say that I watched your show today and thought you were great. well you did some mighty fine work yourself.
-full on !
-no thanks. I don't drink well, here's looking at you ! well Weston, tomorrow is the big day now that you would ride in with us. he got away ! we have to go tell Boss about this. and he will be plenty sore. hey sheriff, the gang just jumped me up at the Spanish woman's house.
I got a hunch that if you go up there, you can pick up some of the gang that were mixed up at the stage coach hold up yesterday. yeah ? well you don't get look to me like that you have been in any fight you don't get me out of here on no wild goose chase either.
I am staying right here to guard this money.
-suit yourself.
-oh Utah! I got some prize money for you..
-that's a lot of money there judge ?
-yeah. we are doing pretty well. taken in 8.000 dollars today, and expecting more tomorrow. we will have close to 30.000 dollars in this bank, by tomorrow night.
30.000 dollars,
- you are taking an awful chance, aren't you ?
I am still guarding this bank, young fellow. pardon me Sheriff ! thanks judge. hello Miss Carter !
Hey Buddy ! ain't you the whooper snapper that won most of the events out there today ?
-I wont appraise it that way.
-sit down. hey, you look like the young fellow that won the belt at Cheyenne, last summer. no that was my grand dad.
I have been nosing around. seems to me that we will have to give this fellow Burton. after what you have done today, he will probably be glad knowing you. get on the bar and make a bet on yourself you lookie up. well alright! if you cant fix him off, then I have to buy him off. if you are wrong with your work
I will use my brain. that boy put it over on you twice. fine bunch you are. guess who is just talk out there. he just came in.
-fine, I will take care of him right now.
-what it will be ?
-wanna place a bet? a 1000 dollars, on Weston to win. he is on 1:2. favor. that's right but its an easy 500.
Beg pardon ! you are Weston aren't you ? my name is Burton ...
...I am head of the rodeo committee.
-I would like to talk to you privately.
-certainly Burton.
I want to apologize for the little over incident that my boys had with you. they thought you were somebody else. they found out their mistake and they are sure sorry.
...I would like to have you meet them. fact is I like to have you join up with us Weston. you will never get into the big money in this game unless you play with a gang.
I guess you know what I mean.
- well it sounds good to me.
I have always heard that you have to be on the inside
...to be anything. what's your proposition? just this, right now you are 1 to 2 in favor. that means you are going to win on a 1000 dollars bet, 500 dollars. seems for you to do is to let me place 2000 for you on Kent's 2:1. and if you should be off form tomorrow and Kent wins, you stand to make 4.000 dollars. now that's a lot better than 500 dollars isn't it ?
- I am glad that you are right. that's fine, I am glad that you can see it our way. come into the back room.
I want you to meet some of the boys. boys, Weston here is going to join up with us.
I want you all to treat him right.
- Weston meet Cheyenne Kent.
- I think we have met before.
-signore Weston, we will see a lot of each other, now that we are friends.
I am kind of agreeing at this racket,
I suppose there are a lot of things over this rodeo business that you can tell me.
-well Boys, see you later. so long Burton. -so long.
-well just make that 2.000 on Weston. see boys, it just takes a bit of brains to handle a guy like that. yeah.. how do you know that he wont cross yourselves ? well, if he does then we can still get him with the needle. we are cleaning up all this after this one anyhow.
-what did you make out son?
-you had the right hunch Martial.
Burton is the brains in the gang alright.
I placed the bet like you told me ... he made me a proposition to join them outfit.
-did you accept ?
-sure, I accepted. he took me right in to introduce me to the rest of the gang. I met them all.
Burton told me that he place 2.000 dollar bet on Cheyenne Kent for me. and if I should lose the event that
I was entered in, I stand to win 4000 dollars. so I don't think that we have much to worry about them, till I start to winning. and then it may be too late for them to get organized.
I don't know son. strikes me, you better be mighty careful. remember what happened to them the other fellas. this gang tough bunch when somebody crosses them.
I don't want to see you take down with snakebite. you get anything out of the Spanish woman ?
-no, she wouldn't talk much. she took me up to that shack on the hill and introduced me to Cheyenne Kent. she said, he was her brother. and before I can get into some understanding.. the whole gang jumped me and I had to curve myself up fast and walking.
I didn't get you into this job to get yourself killed.
-you got any ideas how they work the snakebite proposition ? not yet, but figuring from their past performances
I  cant do much till the bronc riding. that's one of the last events tomorrow. so I will have till the end to figure it out. and besides its going to take them sometime to get wise that I am not gonna lose this rodeo.
- never forgive myself if anything happens to you.
- nothings gonna happen
-come on lets turn in.
-tomorrow is the big day.
I want to announce in time that the high man from yesterday's events was the man from Utah.
...Cheyenne Kent is the runner up. and it looks like a close race. in the events for today, the contestants will contest riding, roping and bull dogging, ending in a thrilling demonstration of horsemanship. and both the man from Utah and 
Cheyenne Kent will try their luck on Dynamite. may the best man win ! and for the first time ladies and gentlemen..
...you will see the Indians from the Daltons reservation... Zaenìte let her go. they are sure going to give it to you today. do you think you got it doped out..
I don't know for certain, but I gotta good hunch
- you better not take any chances.
- its the only way to get the dope on them say, you got that snakebite medicine.
- sure, plenty of them.
- that's what I will try here take this out there with the needle. what are you thinking about son ? on my mind, I think I got this thing figured out. come on I am on the next event. next is the bull dogging ladies and gentlemen watch closely, this is going to be good
Cheyenne Kent will try to keep bulldogging record. let her go. his time was 13 second, the best so far.
John Weston, the man from Utah is next up.
I got to leave Mergeree. the receipts are in by now.
I have got to take them over and put it in the vault. that was another one from the man from Utah folks. he beat the best time by 2 seconds. or 11 seconds flat. we got to stop that guy right now. if he wins the bronc riding we are licked. when that double crosser comes up for the bronc, you boys get the needle. and make it strong .. and now get going. ladies and gentlemen Cheyenne Kent will attempt to ride Dynamite. unridden for 3 years. let her go.
- everything all fixed up for me boys ?
-its all yours ! maybe I better sit into one saddle myself to make sure. you will find everything alright. ladies and gentlemen, the man from Utah will try his luck on Dynamite. ride him cowboy ! just a minute. let him loose. man from Utah on Dynamite ! that guy is wise. he found out about the needle and now he is riding the bronc. we better get moving. we clear out the bank and get over the line.
-what about me ?
-that's for you to figure out. he rode him ladies and gentlemen. he rode him ! what a ride.
-Senor Weston !
-what's the matter ?
Barton and his boys are holding up the bank and they have left us behind.
-put up your hands !
- well sheriff.. I ... robbery and murder eh ? well you didn't get away with it.
I thought you acted kind of suspicious last night when you were looking over that money 
...and tried to get me out of there.
-but.. Sheriff ! save your breath young fellow. just a minute sheriff...
...I am United States martial that young fella was working for me. we were after a gang of rodeo crooks and you almost let the biggest one getaway. now I gotta organize a posse and go after him. nice work son, come on boys take him out. boy you got them red handed. that's not all, here's enough evidence that can send that gang up for murder. whenever anyone interfered with their rodeo plans they stuck one of these needles. dipped in snake venom in the saddle. that's how the men died and why we couldn't prove any of them....
...I knew there was a mystery about this bunch. by jolly, it took you to figure it out. well you see Miss Margaret, its like this, he had to play up to that gal
...so he can get in with the gang. well, in that case I will have to forgive him. say young fella, how about the deputy sheriff job ? sorry judge, but I cant accept.
-it will interfere with my plans
-plans .. what are you planning now ? well dad, he promised to stay away from these beautiful seneoritas...
...and we got to plan our honeymoon. so long judge.
MAN: Chandu the Magician.
MAN: In the three years that thou has dwelt among us... thou has conquered the atma of the spirt... and found thy reward in the powers proclaimed by Shiva.
Thou shalt look into the eyes of men... and they shall be as straw in thine hands.
Thou shalt cause them to see what is not there... even unto a gathering of 12 times 12.
My son, I proclaim thee one of the sacred company of the yogi... and bestow upon thee the name of Chandu.
Thou hast done well, my son.
To few indeed of thy race have the secrets of the yogi been revealed.
To you, my teacher, I express my thanks.
- What more can I learn?
- Nothing, now. The world needs thee.
Go forth in thy youth and strength... and conquer the evil that threatens mankind.
I have gazed in the crystal, and I've seen the forces of death and destruction... rising from the brain of a madman.
Look.
- CHANDU: Who is this man?
- YOGI: This man is Roxor.
YOGI: Last of an ancient family that lived in Alexandria.
He has built a home in the rock temple of Madu... that stands on the great cliffs above the third cataract of the Nile.
But why am I appointed to fight this man?
It is fate who has chosen thee for the task, my son.
And because no man fights so well as when he is protecting his loved ones... fate has thrown thine own family in the path of this human monster.
Look.
CHANDU: Dorothy... my sister.
YOGI: Yes. Her husband has brought his family to Cairo... so that he maybe near his friend Roxor.
YOGI: This man, Robert Regent... has a secret of enormous power.
CHANDU:
Yes. For years, my brother-in-law... has worked to perfect a death ray strong enough to destroy whole cities.
- (NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE)
- He's never found it.
YOGI:
This death ray in the hands of Roxor...
Means an end to goodness...
An end to all that is noble... all that is sane.
Can't you do something?
Surely the police must be able to find some trace of him.
Oh, please telephone me as soon as you have any news at all.
- Thanks.
- Oh, Mother. Mother, you mustn't worry.
- I'm sure we'll hear from Father soon.
- (DOOR OPENS)
- Mother? Look at the letters I found.
- Where did you get them, Betty?
- In the laboratory.
- You didn't go out there in the dark now?
Oh, Mother, how could anyone be hanging around the garden in this sandstorm?
I thought I might find some clues in them.
But you mustn't go outside again.
Why? Did you see something?
Tell me. Did you bolt the door when you came through?
I... I don't remember.
- What did you see, Mother?
- Nothing, Bobby.
It may be foolish, but I thought I saw a face peering in at that window.
Oh, Mother, let's go away from here.
We can't, dearest. Not until we have some news from your father.
- (CLATTERING)
- Listen!
I thought I heard a door close.
- What's that?
- (EERIE RINGING)
Well, what's the matter?
Don't you recognize me?
- Oh, Frank! (SOBBING)
- There, there.
Now, don't cry. Don't cry.
I've come here to help you find Robert.
- Uncle Frank, do you know about Father?
- Yes, dear.
- Do you know where he is?
- I want to talk to you alone, Dorothy.
My, my, Betty Lou, how you've grown.
And Bobby too. But he's too big to kiss.
Sure. We're grown up pretty nearly,
Uncle Frank... so why can't we stay and hear what you know about Father?
- I'll tell you everything later.
- There's something I want to know now.
What was that bell that rang just before you came in?
That was an astral bell.
It tells you when a yogi is near.
- You're really a yogi now?
- Mm-hmm.
And when I hear that bell, I know it's a warning from a yogi that danger threatens.
- (HOWLING)
- What's that?
DOROTHY: It's only a pride of dogs down by the river.
"Now that I know your plans, no money on earth...
"could persuade me to sell you the secret of the death ray.
"If you try to approach me again,
I shall denounce you to the authorities.
I'm convinced you are a madman and should be dealt with accordingly."
Do you know whom this letter was intended for?
- No.
- Roxor.
- Roxor?
- I'm sure of it. Robert's his prisoner.
- Where?
- That I don't know.
I tried to communicate with his mind, but the crystal revealed nothing.
He must be...
- Dead?
- No, no.
Just probably drugged, that's all.
Unconscious.
Robert Regent, I'm calling you. Calling!
You see? It's useless.
Calling him has no response.
(SCREAMING) Help!
Let me go! Stop it!
- Who sent you here?
- Roxor.
- Where did you see Roxor?
- At the wine cellar of... (INDISTINCT)
Open in the name of Osiris... the blind eyes, sealed lips, deaf ears.
- ## (MIDEASTERN)
- (CHATTERING)
I wish to see Roxor.
The effendi is speaking with a friend and may not be disturbed.
He will see me.
Tell him it is Princess Nadji.
MAN: Bring the princess here.
We must not let her find you here, Abdullah.
I don't know yet whether she is to be a friend or an enemy.
If she proves to be an enemy,
I beg you let me deal with her.
Why? Do you hate the princess Nadji?
I hate her.
Yet I want her more than
I've ever wanted any woman before.
Very well, Abdullah.
If Nadji opposes me... and you serve me well... there shall be a new slave in your harem.
ROXOR: Come in.
Let me have your cloak.
Then I may not feast my eyes on your lovely figure?
- Why have you sent for me, Roxor?
- Why?
To offer you my friendship.
- Well, here we are.
- Yes, but how are we going to get in?
You're not going in.
You're going to stay here and watch.
But it'd be much more fun to go in with you.
Listen, Bobby, in case anything happens to me... your mother and Betty Lou will need a man to protect them.
Stay here.
You have the word, brother?
Open in the name of Osiris... the blind eyes, sealed lips, deaf ears.
But my people are happy and contented.
The great dams have multiplied our crops a hundredfold.
What if I destroy those dams?
- What?
- Yes.
I can do it with one blast from my death ray.
Then where will your people be?
More than a billion tons of water will sweep down on them... drowning them like rats.
The greatest flood since the biblical deluge.
So, unless my people join in making you a modern pharaoh... you will annihilate them.
Pharaoh.
I shall be greater than any pharaoh.
Civilization and all its works shall be destroyed.
Men shall return to savagery... following only one supreme intelligence... me.
You see, you're my prisoner.
Every man in this house is my servant.
- You can't keep me here.
- I shan't try.
You are to be sent to a friend of mine as a present.
Did you call me, master?
Take this woman through the tunnel to the river. A boat is waiting.
Come!
Come, Nadji, quick.
- Chandu!
- (MOUTHS WORDS) Come.
What's the matter with you?
Stop them! Stop those two!
After them!
Stop them!
- Everything aboard, Ahmed?
- Yes, effendi.
Very well.
Mother, is she a real princess?
Yes, Betty.
Uncle Frank says she's descended... from a long line of ancient Egyptian kings.
- And are we really going to her palace?
- No, Bobby.
- We're going to her dahabieh.
- Her "daha" what?
Oh, Bobby, don't you know that's a houseboat?
And the princess says we'll have to travel all night by camelback.
Won't that be great?
Wasn't it strange that chance should have sent you... to look for Roxor just when
I needed you most?
It wasn't chance, Nadji. It was fate.
I mean, it was, uh... It was fate that brought me in front of that door.
At first I didn't recognize you.
You see, it's three years since last we met.
- Remember?
- Yes.
Those days in Paris...
I've thought a lot about them.
I know.
In the yogi monastery, there's a pool... where you can see the face of anyone who's thinking of you.
And did you see my face in it?
If you would have looked in it, you would have seen mine much oftener.
Mother, do you think the princess can help us in finding Father?
I don't know, darling, but Uncle Frank says we'll be much safer... as her guests than if we're left here alone.
Well, I shouldn't be frightened anywhere with Uncle Frank.
Oh, look. There are the camels.
El Mahafi, are you ready to leave?
Yes, Princess, and tomorrow's sun will see us there.
Cush. Cush.
You bloomin' idiot.
Don't you understand plain English?
Voulez-vous cush?
Oh, why don't you kneel down when I ask you to?
Aw, I wish I had it.
- Miggles!
- Captain Chandler.
(CHUCKLES) That's all right, Miggles.
Don't salute me, and don't call me Captain Chandler.
We're out of the army now.
What are you doing in that funny-looking getup?
Nursemaid to a blooming camel.
Oh, I'm so happy I met you, Captain.
You've gotta get me out of this.
You've gotta give me a job.
I'll work for you for nothing. After all,
I was a good orderly, wasn't I, sir?
Are you still drinking, Miggles?
Well, sir... (COUGHS)
Changin' the subject, do you still do your magic tricks?
Oh, much better ones. Look at me.
Now look behind you.
- Aaah!
- (CHUCKLING)
Take off your hat.
- Why, you dirty little snoop.
- Who, me?
Oh. Oh, he can talk.
- Oh, take him away.
- (CHUCKLES)
- Make him go away.
- That's all right. He's only in your mind.
Oh, don't tell me I'm going balmy.
He's gone!
How would you like to take a very dangerous trip with me?
Sure. You know me. I love danger.
All right, then. Come on.
Oh, thank you, Captain. Thank you.
Every time you get drunk you're going to see that little fella.
- Understand?
- I understand.
So help me goodness, governor, this is the finish.
When a man starts to see things like that...
- Well, it's time to quit.
- Okay.
- You all right, Princess Nadji?
- Yes.
Miggles. Behave.
I can't thank you enough, Nadji.
Now that Dorothy and the children are safe...
I'll be free to find Robert.
I think I can help you.
- You, Nadji?
- Yes.
Roxor has been seen by some of my people... near the ruins of Madu.
Where are they?
- On the third cataract.
- How far is it?
Not very far.
My boat can be there in 24 hours.
Go straight to Roxor and inform the master... that the princess and the foreigner are on their way to rescue Regent.
Tell him I will see that the white man gets no further than the houseboat.
And now, tell me.
Have you married since I saw you last?
No. That's one feat of magic that requires a beautiful assistant.
- But you've been in love?
- All the time.
(LAUGHS) I might have known.
There are too many charming women in the world.
Not too many.
Oh, now, don't misunderstand me, Nadji.
All the time in love, but always with the same woman.
Do I know her?
You should.
She was a present to your father and mother on your birthday.
(LAUGHS) You're never serious, are you?
Never so serious as now, Nadji.
Tell me. Have you found someone?
Even if I had, my life belongs to my people.
You know, you told me that three years ago.
You think I'm foolish, don't you?
No, dear. Just very, very young... and making an unnecessary sacrifice.
Sometimes I think so too.
Hello.
You have a visitor.
His name is Abdullah.
He's been coming here very often lately.
Oh. I see.
For the white man.
It is Roxor who commands.
NADJI: I'll order some refreshments.
Ali? Some wine.
- You must be choked with sand and dirt.
- You're right.
I love the looks of the desert, but I hate the taste of it.
I thought I'd pay you a surprise visit.
- I'm afraid I'm rather in the way.
- No, not at all.
But unfortunately, my boat is starting at once.
And is the gentleman I just saw making this romantic trip with you?
Romantic is hardly the word.
With a woman as lovely as you are, Nadji... it couldn't be business.
You have a strange way of paying compliments, Abdullah.
Who is this friend of yours?
He is called Chandu.
Chandu.
Beg pardon, Captain.
Is this where the danger starts?
Not yet.
- (RINGING)
- That's funny. A telephone way out here?
That's strange.
You haven't told me yet.
Why are you going up the Nile?
- You know Roxor?
- Ro... Roxor.
Oh, is he that crazy scientist who lives in one of the rock temples?
Yes.
No, I've never met him.
Is he the man you're going to visit?
I understand that Roxor has discovered... many valuable relics of the 12th Egyptian Dynasty.
Wait.
Drink.
Go on, drink.
CHANDU: This wine is... is poisoned
CHANDU: Robert Regent, I'm calling.
Robert Regent, I am calling.
Robert Regent, where are you?
Look. Look!
The crystal's clearing at last.
NADJI: The great rock temple at Madu.
CHANDU:
Roxor is trying to build a huge death ray.
It's Robert. He's still alive.
NADJI: Roxor is there.
CHANDU: Robert hasn't told him the secret.
NADJI:
Oh, he'll torture him until he does.
CHANDU: That's your servant...
The man who gave us the poisoned wine.
Roxor is punishing him because he failed.
NADJI: Chandu, this man is heartless.
Roxor will kill him.
Not as long as he has any hope of forcing Robert to give up his secret.
What was that message the Arab just brought?
I don't know.
Nadji, you say you know the way to this temple?
Yes.
- (MOANS)
- Quiet, Miggles, quiet.
Oh, Captain!
Quiet, Miggles. Quiet.
Miggles, stay here and keep watch.
Yes, Captain. I can manage.
(GASPING) Captain! Captain!
Captain! Captain!
(MOANING) Captain!
Captain! Captain! Captain! Aaah!
Captain! Captain! Captain!
- Captain!
- What's the matter? What's happened?
One of them bloomin' stone idols hopped off his perch and ran away.
- And he pinched my hat.
- You've been drinking again, have you?
So help me, it's true. I swear it on the heads of me unborn children.
Captain! Captain!
Look!
- Chandu!
- Fear not, Princess. You are to live.
But you will see your friends die.
(MOANING) Oh, Mother.
Before we die... accept my blessing.
MAN: Open! Open!
- A fiend!
- A fiend!
Halt!
My will shall be your will.
Now I command you. Take me to the effendi Professor Robert Regent.
- He is not here.
- Speak the truth.
- The master has taken him away.
- Where to?
To the secret market of Bab Doukkala.
There, unless he speaks, he will see his daughter sold as a slave.
- What does it mean?
- It means that Roxor can do nothing... by threatening Robert, so he's kidnapped Betty Lou. Come!
Miggles.
(MOANING) Oh, Captain.
Miggles.
Oh, governor, take away those snakes.
Come on, Miggles.
Pick up your gun. Pick up your gun!
(GASPS) Take it away! Take it away!
Take it away! Take it away!
Never another drop, so help me.
Are you ready to tell me the secret of the death ray?
No.
You still may change your mind.
Never.
- Father! Father!
- Betty Lou!
My child.
What are you going to do with her?
That depends on you.
Will you tell me the secret of the ray?
- No.
- Take her to the block.
- ROBERT: No! No!
- No, no, no! (SOBBING)
- Don't!
- Father!
- (SOBBING) Father!
- ROBERT: Don't take her!
- Don't!
- Please stop! Father! Please!
Let her go!
You shall stand at that window and see her sold.
Help me, Father! Don't!
Let me go! Father, help me!
Kill me.
Kill me if you will, but let her go.
Courage, Betty Lou.
It's not too late to save her.
No. Whatever happens to me or mine,
I'll never tell you.
ROXOR: Get out!
Master! Master!
- (CHIRPING)
- Master! Master!
Allah, save us!
I saw the gold with mine own eyes!
This is magic!
Allah be praised!
Stop that man! Run after him!
Run after him!
Guard!
Abdullah!
Guard!
- Why didn't you hold him at the gate?
- He never passed the gate.
When these hands tried to seize him, there was nothing there but a burnoose.
That one.
- GUARD: The devil!
- (ALL SHOUTING)
Now I know who is fighting us.
Chandu... A man who has at his command the wizardry of the East.
- What is his power?
- Ah.
Hypnotism, nothing more.
Is there no way through which we can attack him?
Yes, one.
Samson's strength was in his hair.
Chandu's strength... is in his eyes.
Mother, here they are.
- Oh, Betty!
- Bobby!
- Oh, my poor child.
- Mother, dear, please don't worry about me.
It was dreadful to see Father like that, his face drawn with agony.
- So desperate!
- Don't. I can't bear it.
CHANDU: Now, Dorothy, don't worry.
Please, Frank.
Can't something be done to save him?
I'm going right back after him, dear, as soon as I get fresh horses.
There, there.
- Miggles, be ready to leave in half an hour.
- Yes, sir.
We're going to the rock temple.
All right, sir.
The rock temple, I think he said.
This calls for another drink.
Walking idols and guns that turns into snakes?
This certainly calls for a drink.
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
Who? Me?
What for?
- For seeing things again.
- Now, go on. Hop it.
Is that a nice way to behave?
I thought you was a gentleman.
And I thought you were a gentleman too.
We were both mistaken, weren't we?
Don't you talk back at me.
I'm not talking back at you.
You're talking to yourself.
Miggles, aren't you ashamed of ourselves?
Every time you drink that liquor, you're not yourself.
If you're not yourself, how am I to know who I am?
If you're not you and I'm not me, then who are we?
Neither of us. Miggles, behave.
All right. I give in.
I'll never touch another.
- Nadji, why this costume?
- I'm going with you.
- No.
- But I might help you.
No, darling.
That last trip was too dangerous.
I couldn't risk losing you again.
At least I can go as far as the oasis.
Please.
If anything happened to you, Nadji, dear... do you think I could ever forgive myself?
Do I really mean so much?
- More than so much.
- (COUGHING)
- The horses is here, sir.
- Nadji.
No, thank you. You'd better order a horse for me, Miggles.
- That's all right. You can have mine.
- Miggles!
What's the matter with you?
You seem nervous.
Well, it's...
It's all this excitement, sir.
Could you fix it up for me, so I could have a drink without seeing anything?
You haven't had one all day?
No, sir.
All right, Miggles. You may have one then.
- Here's to you.
- To you, Miggles.
As I said, sir, here's to you.
Oh, go and take a good swim!
Be careful. This is tear gas.
If you break it, it'll blind you.
CHANDU: Well, here we are.
- Dear, keep yourself hidden.
- Don't you worry about me.
You have more important things on your mind.
Never anything more important than you,
Nadji, dear.
Sometimes I wonder if you really know the meaning of danger.
I do, darling. I do when it concerns you.
You know, I'm not a bit afraid... when we are together, and you speak to me like that.
When you look at me like that, nothing else matters.
Be careful. If not for your own sake... then for mine?
A bargain.
And you, darling, be careful... for mine.
Take no chances.
Chandu!
Ride, Nadji! Ride away quick!
(GASPING) I'm helpless.
Roxor was right.
Your magic comes from your eyes.
- Chandu!
- Bring him to Roxor!
DEATH RAY WORKER: Only Regent can do it!
Well done, Abdullah.
Now I'll have my revenge on Chandu.
Yes, but that doesn't tell you how to operate your death ray.
No?
You followed Regent's plans in building this elaborate machine... but he still withholds the knowledge to release its power.
Regent was near to breaking when he saw his daughter on the slave block, wasn't he?
Yes.
If Roxor threatens his wife and children... what then, Abdullah?
In a few hours, his whole family will be here.
How?
In that cell, he's now writing a letter to them.
MAN: Effendi!
- Is the letter ready?
- Where's Roxor?
He's not here.
If you'll take it to my family, they will reward you.
It's only a letter of farewell.
- The letter will be delivered, effendi.
- Thank you.
Now look, Abdullah.
For the wife of Robert Regent.
ROXOR'S HENCHMAN:
For the wife of the effendi.
- Are you sure that's really from Father?
- Look, darling, it's his writing.
Oh, wouldn't it be wonderful if we really could save him?
We must save him. I'll get ready.
But, Mother...
There's no need for you to go.
This is a man's job.
- But there's no man here.
- Well, how about me? And Miggles?
- How's that, sir?
- I was just reminding Mother you're a man.
Does she have to be reminded?
If I could only get this bandage off my eyes.
- Oh, if I could only help you.
- Oh, Nadji.
Nadji, what a fool I was to let you come with me.
Don't say that, Chandu.
If these are to be the last hours of your life, I want them to be mine too.
If I could only get you out of here, see you safe once again.
It doesn't matter what happens to me.
I feel so much closer to you now than ever before.
Oh, Nadji, I can't think of losing you... now that I've found you again.
Tell me, if all this hadn't happened... would you have left Egypt, gone with me?
You had only to ask, and I'd have followed you anywhere.
If this is the end, Nadji... let me hear you say "I love you."
I love you.
And I love you.
Well, Chandu, we meet at last.
It isn't quite as you planned though, is it?
Remember this, Roxor.
That the best laid plans of men sometimes go astray.
What do you mean?
I mean that my will is stronger than yours... that it will conquer you.
- That's a lie!
- Is it?
Then why are you afraid to look me in the eyes?
I'm not afraid.
Your eyes would have no effect on me.
Then take off this bandage!
If I were alone, I would.
But these silly natives, they believe your tricks.
You're afraid, I tell you.
Take the bandage from his eyes.
Take it off.
Stop! Stop!
Don't let him fool you.
Get rid of him once and for all.
You're right. (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
You can't do that!
- You can't bury him alive!
- (CHUCKLES)
Why not?
It was a favorite punishment among the priests of Isis who built this temple.
No!
You'd be far better off to kill him.
Why?
Yogis have been known to remain buried for days.
ROXOR: Yes.
But not underwater.
No!
- (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
- No!
No!
- Roxor. Roxor!
- Why are you calling him?
I'll tell him how to work the machine.
Robert, you mustn't!
You said it would mean death to millions.
I'm going to, I tell you, if he'll let you and the children go.
We won't go!
We won't save our lives at such a cost.
Hmm. Why, it's a family reunion.
Let them go, Roxor.
I beg of you, let them go.
There is a way out of this cell, and I'll show it to them.
But not while you are in there.
Just let me stay here.
I don't care what you do with me.
Now, look.
Mother!
ROXOR:
I told you there was a way out, Regent.
That is a river down there... where your friend Chandu has gone.
Have mercy, Roxor!
Stop!
Close it! Close it!
- Will you tell me now?
- Stop!
Mother!
Mother! (WHIMPERING)
- (SCREAMS)
- Stop!
Stop!
- Stop! Stop!
- You'll show me how to work the death ray?
Yes. Yes.
How far will the beam carry?
- Halfway around the world.
- Ah!
Hurry, hurry!
Is it ready?
- (WHISTLE)
- Yes.
Back to his cell.
At last.
I'm king of all.
That lever is my scepter.
London, New York, Imperial Rome...
I can blast them all into a heap of smoking ruins.
Cities of the world shall perish.
All that lives... shall know me as master and tremble at my word.
Paris.
City of fools.
Proud of their Napoleon.
What will they think...
- when they feel the power of Roxor?
- (BOOM)
And England... with its sacred traditions...
Its king. Its triumph... its... its navy...
- will be helpless.
- (BOOM)
They shall bow before me in worship.
Me... Roxor.
- (BOOM)
- I will destroy the dams of the Nile.
And its roaring floods shall sweep down upon... hundreds of thousands... drowning them like rats!
Roxor, the god... whose hand deals death!
Stop! I command you!
Take your hand from that control.
No, you don't frighten me.
You can't move that lever.
I'll move it now!
And you're standing right in the front of the ray.
Your hand is powerless to move, Roxor.
It's a lie.
And you shall be the first man for the ray to kill.
I have come out of a coffin from the depths of the Nile.
My will brought me here... and that will is stronger than yours.
You are helpless.
- No!
- Drop your hands.
Now, stand there.
- Don't move.
- ROBERT: Chandu!
Dorothy! Robert! Are you safe?
Are you all right?
ROBERT: There... It's over... there.
I've doubled the speed of the generator.
The voltage is mounting.
The ambient's at white heat.
The machine will explode in a moment.
- Get out of here, quick!
- Not that way, Frank!
I'm all right. Hurry!
For years I've wanted you, and now I've got you.
- You beast!
- There's no use fighting.
Nadji!
Nadji! Nadji!
Nadji!
Chandu! Look out!
Nadji! Na...
- Captain!
- (BUZZING)
Chandu! Chandu!
- Where are they?
- Let's go.
- Are you all right, Nadji, dear?
- Uncle Frank! Uncle Frank!
Children! Dorothy!
- Thank heaven you're safe, Frank.
- That was brave of you, Robert.
You set the machine to destroy even your whole family... rather than give it to Roxor.
Aaah!
Help!
LITTLE MIGGLES: Where can we get a drink?
You oughta be ashamed of yourself.
Come on.

[Vendors yelling]
Ha ha! Bull's-Eye.
Aw, it's dead as a doornail around here.
Yeah. How about seein' a picture, rocky?
They got a good one down at the academy on 14th street.
Yeah? What?
Covered wagon. It's brand-New. Just come out.
You got any dough?
Nah. You got any?
No.
Oh, look.
There's rocky sullivan.
Walk right by him.
Make out we don't see him.
Hey, rocky, there's laury martin comin'.
So what?
Oh, my books.
They're coming loose.
Say! That ain't a bad-Lookin' doll-
That one in the middle,
The one with the pretzel legs.
He means you, laury.
Why, the fresh-
Don't be so smart-Alecky, rocky sullivan.
Go on.
Beat it, pigtails.
Trying to show off, ain't you?
Scram, before i wipe the street with you.
You better wipe your nose first.
Is that so?
Well, i'll fix you.
You better scram.
You know rocky.
Oh, leave me alone.
I can handle him.
Wait till i get down there.
I'll fix you.
Aw, i'll slap you down.
Ooh! Why, you-
You-
Shut up.
Ha ha!
Ha ha!
Come on. Let's get out of here.
You won't get away with that, rocky sullivan!
I'll get even with you someday!
You just wait!
[Train bell clanging]
[Engine slowly chugging]
[Speeding up]
[Whistle blows]
Maybe this winter, we can hop one of these freights
Down to florida.
They say you can go swimming there,
Even in january.
Sure. We can even hop one to california,
If we wanted to.
Look here.
"Rubelin coal co, pittsburgh, pennsylvania."
It's too bad it ain't winter.
We could grab a couple bags of those coals.
"Everwrite fountain pen co. "
I wonder what's in there.
Come on.
Let's take a look.
It's loaded full of cases.
Fountain pens!
Hundreds of 'em!
We can break that easy.
Maybe we shouldn't, rocky.
We don't need those pens.
It ain't like stealin' coal to keep warm.
We can sell 'em, can't we?
Now, listen. What we don't take we ain't got.
Come on, look around.
See what you can find to break that lock.
All right, whoever's in here, come on out.
Come on out, i say!
[Tweet]

What's the trouble?
A couple of kids.
Come on out of there.
Come on, you hoodlums.
You ain't gonna get away with this.
Come out, or i'll come in after you.
We gotta make a break for it, jerry.
Right now!
[Whistle blows]
[Train whistle blowing]
[Bell clanging]
Come on, rocky!
Jump!
Hi, snowflakes.
Hi, jerry.
Whaddya hear? Whaddya say?
Come on. Sit down.
How are they treatin' you, rocky?
Like a prince. I get three square meals a day
And i get real butter on my bread.
What a life. Say, is that a bad cut on your eye?
Not bad. Just a few stitches in it.
I thought you knocked your eye out or somethin'.
Comin' to my trial tomorrow?
Listen, rocky, i've been worrying about this
All last night.
I can't let you take the whole blame.
Pipe down. You want that flapper to hear you?
Now get this. You got away, didn't you? Ok.
Now, why be a sucker?
But, rocky, maybe if they thought i was in on it,
They'd go easier on you.
In a pig's eye they would.
Now you listen to me.
Just 'cause you can run faster than me,
You don't need to go around and eat yourself.
But it ain't fair to you, rocky.
Look, so they send me up. So what?
What have i got to lose?
The old man's got troubles enough without me.
Forget it.
It's the breaks.
I got caught, and you got away, that's all.
But you, rocky. Supposin' i was the one who got caught.
I bet you wouldn't keep quiet.
You'd make 'em send you up, too.
Go on. What do you think i am?
I'd lay dead, just like you're gonna do.
You would?
Sure. Always remember-
Don't be a sucker.
Listen, rocky, i'm pulling every string i can.
I'm seeing all the right people.
I think i can get you off with about three years.
You talk like i could do that three years in a handstand.
That's along time.
That ain't no picnic.
You'll be outside having it soft on those cushions.
It's a tough break, but i'm not gonna mark time.
I'll scout around, make connections for both of us.
Why should i take the fall?
There's no other way out.
Now, be sensible.
If they get me, too, i'll not only be disbarred,
But they'll check my vault and grab that 100 grand.
You don't want to lose that dough, do you?
All right, frazier.
It's my rap, and i'll take it,
But it's my 100 grand,
And i'll take that, too, the day i get out.
Look, i know you're a smart lawyer,
Very smart,
But don't get smart with me.
[Swing music playing]
[Horn honking]
[Music playing]
[Boys choir singing in latin]
[Singing along silently]
Very good, boys.
That's all.
Wait till i get you outside, you mug-Face.
I'll immobilize you.
Yeah? You and your old maid!
[Knock on door]
Come in.
What's on your mind, son?
Oh, not very much, father.
It's just been botherin' me for about 15 years.
What did you do with those fountain pens
You stole out of that freight car?
Rocky, you old-
Jerry, glad to see you.
Whaddya hear?
Whaddya say?
Whaddya hear? Whaddya say?
I'm glad to see you.
15 years. Hasn't changed a bit.
You remember father boyle's old sacristy, huh?
Remember it? He used to stand right where you are
And boil the tar out of me.
Gosh. 15 years.
It doesn't seem possible
I haven't seen you in that length of time.
I've seen you.
You have? Where?
I was in the stands
The day you made that
90-Yard run against nyu.
Why didn't you come back and see me?
Couldn't. Some people were waitin' for me.
Oh.
Well, i got a kick coming, though.
Why haven't you written to me?
Aw, you know how it is, jerry.
I changed my address and number so often,
You had no way of answerin' me.
And you know what happens to letters written in the stir.
Everybody from the p. K.
Down reads 'em.
Then when i was inside nothin' happened anyway,
And when i was out,
It was all there to read on the front page.
Yes, i... i read all the papers.
Well, you certainly make a good-Lookin' priest.
Thanks.
Your mother always wanted you to do it,
But what finally decided you?
I was riding along on the top of a bus,
Looking down, passing the cathedral.
That give you the idea?
That's funny.
I got an idea on the top of a bus one time.
Got me six years.
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
I was standin' around
While you were singin' with those kids,
And i kept thinkin' of you and me
Doin' the same thing
20 years ago.
Remember the time
We slipped the music of merry oldsmobile
Into the hymn book?
How could i forget it?
How'd it go?
* lead, kindly light *
* 'mid the encircling gloom *
* lead thou me on, for the night is dark *
* and i am far from- **
Ha ha! Certainly did a lot of crazy things
In those days, rocky.
Certainly did.
Certainly did.
[Knock on door] come in.
Fadda, youse is s'posed to be down at the store.
The fellas are all waitin' for you.
You run along and tell 'em i'll be right over.
Tell 'em to get the game started.
Ok, fadda!
What's this store racket?
You got the kids shillin' for the parish?
Ha ha! That's not a bad idea, rocky.
No. It's a pet scheme of mine-
Sort of a recreation spot for the kids.
Kind of a kindergarten place, huh?
No. It's for the big fellas, too.
You'd be surprised how tremendously it's helped
To keep the kids from becoming...
Hoodlums like me?
Ha ha!
You know, you've cost me a lot of prayer.
I've been to kind of a retreat myself.
Yes. Will you be here for some time?
Depends. I got a little business to attend-
Well, anyway, i gotta find a place to live.
Get a room here in the parish.
That's not a bad idea.
No place like home.
Yes, and it's great to have you home, too.
I just came back to take a look at your kisser.
Take a lot of them.
This is maggione's.
Go in there and get a furnished room.
You remember her, don't you?
Took a lot of good lead pipe out of that cellar.
Church is right around the corner.
I can drop in to see you from time to time.
See you at mass sunday?
Sure. I'll help you with your collection.
It's a deal.
Fair enough.
[Ring]
Is mrs. Maggione at home?
What do you want?
Lookin' for a room.
My mudda ain't here now,
But the lady in 2, she'll show you the rooms.
In there?
Woman: yes?
Yes?
I'm lookin' for a room.
Mrs. Maggione's kid told me you'd take care of that.
Yes. I'll... i'll get the key.
Third floor.
You know, there's somethin' about your face
That looks awfully familiar.
You just been lookin' at the funny papers, that's all.
No, really.
Listen, sister, all i'm lookin' for is a room.
Here it is.
Mrs. Maggione will give it a good cleaning.
That's all right.
I've seen worse.
I guess you have.
[Shade flaps]
I'll take the room.
What's the tariff?
Five dollars a week.
Sold.
In advance.
Oh.
All right.
Write me a receipt.
You can trust me.
Say, how did you happen to come to this house?
Lookin' for references, huh?
An old friend of mine sent me over here-
Jerry connelly, the priest over at the parish house.
You know him?
Father jerry?
Yeah. Does that send me in?
Oh, i get it now.
You're rocky sullivan.
Yeah.
Remember me?
No.
Laury martin?
Laury martin?
That little fresh kid with the pigtails?
Well, hello. Whaddya hear?
Whaddya say?
Hello.
Hey! Wait a minute!
I've waited 15 years to do that!
Ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha ha!
[Crash]
[Swing music playing]
I want to see jim frazier.
I want to see frazier.
He's busy.
I'll wait.
Who are you?
Rocky sullivan.
Oh. Come on.
Man: number one.
Clear the board.
Wait here.
There's somebody outside to see you.
Yeah? Who?
Rocky sullivan.
Rocky sullivan?
Yeah.
Does he know i'm here?
Sure. Didn't you want me to tell him?
That's all right.
Send him in.
Well, well, rocky.
This is a surprise.
Whaddya hear?
Whaddya say?
I had the date on the calendar,
Only i thought it was next month.
Otherwise, i would have met you
With the brass band and all the trimmings.
Yeah, i thought it was funny you didn't show,
But you've been busy the last three years.
You certainly got a swell layout here.
Looks like you're in the dough.
Yes. Well, you know mac keefer.
Heard of him. He owns the town, can buy it and sell it.
Only he doesn't buy it.
He sells it.
That's soft, eh?
A whole lot softer than that store cot
I've been sleeping on for the last three years.
Well, you're out now, rocky.
Yeah.
Where's that dough?
What? The 100 grand?
I had it for you, only, as i said, i didn't expect-
I know.
You said it before.
You don't have to worry about it.
I'm not worried about it.
I'll have it for you by the end of the week.
In the meantime,
I suppose you'd like some spending money.
Here. Here's 500.
It will take me a few days to get settled.
You can get that dough together
And tell me where i come in.
Where you come in?
What do you mean?
What business you want me to handle,
What parts of town, and what my cut is.
Your cut?
Yeah. That was the idea, wasn't it?
I took the rap, the three years.
You took the dough, made the connections,
Built it up for you and me. Wasn't that it?
Oh, i see. Yes.
Uh... i understand,
But... you've got this thing all wrong.
You see, i work for keefer.
He's the boss.
I haven't anything to say.
If you want to find a spot in his business, why...
You'll have to take it up with him.
Now, look, frazier,
I'm not takin' up with anybody but you.
You figure it out for yourself.
I'm takin' up with you where i left off.
That was the agreement, and we're gonna stick to it.
Got it?
Well, yes, but, uh...
But what?
Well, uh...
[Door opens]
Frazier: hello, mac.
Am i breaking in on anything here, jim?
No, not at all.
Come right in.
I want you to meet rocky sullivan.
Pleased to meet you, sullivan.
I know all about you.
You're ok.
When'd you get out?
Couple days ago.
I'm looking around.
Maybe i might have a spot for you.
We were just talkin' about that.
Where you stopping, rocky?
I've got a room over at my old neighborhood,
On dock street, number 24.
Well, i'll blow now.
I'll drop up, say, monday?
Monday?
That will be fine.
I'm going downtown.
I'll give you a lift.
Oh, thanks.
See you later, jim.
Monday.
Get me steve.
Hello. There's a fella leavin' with mac,
And i want you to...
Yeah?
Yeah, i got a good look.
Yeah, yeah. I got it.
Sure, i'll take care of it.
[Whistling]
Out of the way, blubber-Head.
The famine is on.
All you guys can have cigarettes off of me.
You better pack 'em now, boys.
Here comes the beef trust.
How do you do?
A nickel you don't conk him.
All right.
A nickel i do.
You missed him, chump.
Yeah. It's a nickel apiece you owe us.
Aw, that cop don't walk right or somethin'.
Those cops are so dumb, it's pathetic.
You'd think they'd learn where a tomato comes from
In police college.
Look.
[In a cutesy voice] hello, toots.
You want the bottle?
You want the bottle?
Aw, nuts.
Hey! What are you do with my baby?
[Mockingly] hey! What are you do with my baby?
Here's your baby!
You loafer! I'll get the cops after you!
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
The way he talks, you'd think he had somethin' there.
Hi, johnny.
Excuse me.
Hey. Look at the dude.
Come on. Let's give him the works.
All right, kiddo.
Hey, watch out!
Give me that!
I'll make you eat that ball in a minute!
Aw, come on!
Let's go!
Like takin' candy from a baby.
[Indistinct excited chatter]
How'd you get it, crab?
I hoisted it over the transom back of the alley
And dropped it down to hunky here.
The corner caught me right in the dome.
So long as it didn't break the machine.
Boy, we'll be in the money now.
Six nickels and two slugs.
Imagine crooks like that puttin' slugs in a slot machine.
Chiselers.
[Whistling]
Shh! Pipe down.
Aw, it's only soapy and the gang.
Hi, soapy!
Soapy, look what we got.
Aw, you should see the hook i got.
It's the most i got in me life.
We got a sucker's poke.
No kiddin'!
Come on. Dish it out.
Time's a-Wastin'.
You grabbin' already?
Haa haa haa!
Gimme air!
Gimme air!
How much you got there, soapy?
Let me see.
Gee! There must be more than 100 there!
100, nothin'. We're in the big chips now.
Wow! What a haul!
[Mockingly] what a haul! Nyah!
Six ways! Don't forget! Six ways!
You'll get yours.
What, are you grabbin' already?
Aw, come on.
Come on.
Gimme, soapy.
Oh, that looks nice.
Oh, my!
We split half, all right?
Hey, i didn't get mine!
Gimme!
You bunch of chiselers!
Stick 'em up!
[Silence]
You're all covered.
Hey, give us a break, mister.
We wasn't even there.
We didn't have nothin' to do with it.
Say your prayers, mugs.
On the level, mister!
We wasn't there!
Soapy: shut up, brats!
Stop your squealin'.
Who's the leader?
I am.
Come here.
Collect that dough...
And fast.
Come on. Hand it over.
You, too. Come on.
Here.
Now get 'em up and turn around.
Hey!
Hey! What's the matter?
Next time you roll a guy for his poke,
Make sure he don't know your hideout.
How'd you know?
Come here, suckers.
Hey, how do you know this place so good?
Yeah!
Let me show you.
Here.
Look at this.
Hey, you ain't-
You ain't rocky sullivan!
Rocky sullivan!
Hey, did you get that?
It's rocky sullivan!
We tried to hook you!
What a boner!
The minute you saw us duck down the alley,
You knew we was headin' for the hideout.
I took the old shortcut.
What do they call you?
Soapy's the name.
This guy's bim.
This mug here's swing.
This palooka up here's hunky.
Hi, rocky.
And i'm pasty, and this guy's crab-Face,
But we just call him crab for short.
Hi.
Glad to meet you, rocky.
Fellas, meet rocky sullivan!
Hiya, rocky!
Hiya, rocky!
Good to see you!
[Boys talking at once]
Hey, rocky.
Hey, you took the room above us-
Number 24-
Didn't you?
Yeah.
Sure, sure. We knew.
You knew when you rolled me?
Certainly, certainly.
Johnny maggione told us,
But he didn't tell us who you was.
You still shouldn't have taken a chance.
Never bother anybody in your own neighborhood.
You kids got a lot to learn.
You could learn us, rocky.
How would you like to have a bite with me?
[Boys yelling]
Go down to the delicatessen
And get some sandwiches and pickles and some beer.
Bring 'em over to my place.
We'll have a feed.
[Boys yelling excitedly]
[Coins clinking]
Come on. I'm not in a bread line no more.
Will ya give me some beans?
All right, all right!
I'm on no hunger strike.
Give out with this irish caviar.
Come on. A little more, you stingy grubber.
Gimme some pickles.
You don't want any pickles.
Haa haa haa!
Sure, i want pickles.
You like pickles?
Take 'em.
Boy! Pickles!
What are you doin'?
Goin' into business?
No. Souvenirs. Free.
Oh.
Here, rocky.
Here's your change.
41/2 bucks even.
Where's the other 50 cents?
We had to buy somethin', didn't we?
You guys got an awful lot to learn.
Come on, now. Chuck your chest up to the wood.
Aw, these beans are rotten.
Oh. You don't like the beans?
No!
Ha ha ha ha!
Hey, these beans taste soapy.
Ahh... but good!
Very good.
Come in!
Rocky: hello, jerry.
Hello, rocky.
Whaddya hear?
Whaddya say?
Just havin' a little bite to eat with the kids.
Sit in? Right here.
Thanks.
How about a sandwich?
All right.
Thanks, swing.
It didn't take you boys long
To get acquainted with rocky, did it?
Hey, rock, looks like you and the fadda
Are old pals.
Look, next time you go down to the hideout,
Look at that old door.
You'll see right next to my initials-J.C.
Jerry connelly.
You mean fadda used to hang out
With rocky at the old boiler-Room?
Certainly did.
Of course, we spend most of our time
At the gym now, rocky.
That reminds me, boys.
I hoped to start that basketball game today.
We're too busy.
Too busy.
Hey, gimme a sandwich.
What's the matter, soapy?
Why don't you want to go to the basketball game?
It ought to be fun.
What do you think we are?
A bunch of cream puffs?
Hey, imagine us playin' basketball all of a sudden.
[Laughter]
Oh, yeah? Well, i'll tell you what.
I'll bet you a buck to a plug nickel
You can't get the ball past the other team.
Aw, we'll run 'em into the ground.
[Boys yelling]
You'll come with us?
Yeah. Whaddya say?
Is it a bet?
Bim: yeah. I got a nickel. It's a bet.
We ought to have some practice first, though.
Gym's open. You can go over right now.
[Boys yelling excitedly]
Good-Bye, fadda!
[Door closes]
Young roughnecks-I've been workin' on them for a year.
Can't get anyplace.
You talk to 'em 10 minutes,
They'd jump through a hoop if you asked 'em to.
Maybe it's because i wear my collar frontwards.
Maybe. As long as you're sponsoring the gym,
Let's take a look at it.
You mean now?
Sure, why not?
Come on, rocky.
You remember old krausmeyer's store, don't you?
Yeah, sure.
We used to rob it.
Yes! [Chuckles]
Sure, i been trailin' him,
But he's mixed up with a priest and kids,
And i can't get a crack at him.
Don't let him out of your sight.
I'll send bugs down with a couple boys.
Let's wipe up the floor with these kids!
Your kids play a swell game, rocky.
Keep a good eye on 'em.
Keep your chin covered.
[Blows whistle]
Clear the floor!
Take the mats off!
Hello.
Hello.
Friends?
Ok.
What have you been doin',
Playin' a duck for me?
I wasn't gonna hurt you.
No. I'd forgotten you were in the neighborhood.
Oh.
Well, uh, what are you doin'?
Same thing you're doing-
Watching the game.
Say, uh, you know, you turned out to be
A pretty snappy-Lookin' dish.
Thanks.
For a sociable worker.
Thanks again.
I can't figure out
Why some smart guy hasn't grabbed you off.
Some smart guy who's always in the headlines, huh?
You could do worse.
[Blows whistle]
You know better than that.
Wait till i blow the whistle.
Ok.
Let's get goin'.
[Blows whistle]
[Blows whistle]
Here you are.
Right here.
Ready?
[Blows whistle]
Run! Run!
[Blows whistle]
Free throw.
Oh, no! That's not fair.
He didn't do nothin'.
Come on!
That's it.
Come on!
Take it down!
I got my man!
[Blows whistle]
You do that again,
I'll take you out of the game.
I didn't do nothin'.
He's screwy.
Give us a break.
Can't you even shove a guy in this game?
What do you mean, shove a guy?
It's a free throw, gibby. Take it.
That's not fair!
Hey, dribble that ball and pass it.
Dribble that.
[Blows whistle]
Foul!
That big bozo just stuck his belly out.
You boys know better than that.
You've been committing technical fouls
And personal fouls.
Now, stop it.
You've got six men on the floor.
Pasty, get off the floor.
Somebody, take care of that trapeze.
Just be my good deed for today.
All right.
Red out. Take it.
[Blows whistle]
Here.
Watch this.
Make a few notes.
All right, boys!
Mr. Sullivan's gonna referee.
Don't forget about that bet.
Go on.
Get off the floor!
What am i, an orphan?
Now! Get goin'!
Ow!
Don't forget.
Accordin' to rules, now.
Here we go.
Wait for the whistle.
What's the matter with you?
Come in. Get in here.
Play ball.
Ready?
Position, now.
Here we go.
Wait for the whistle.
Ow!
What's goin' on here?
What's goin' on?
Rocky sure handles those kids, doesn't he?
Yes, but don't you think it's a little bit
Like playing with dynamite?
Why do you say that?
Just because you've got me seeing things straight now,
There's no reason i should wear blinders.
I still remember what rocky's kind is like.
I don't know.
Somehow i feel that rocky could be straightened out.
Get up!
Come on! Let's go!
[Cheering]
Foul!
All right!
Come on, soapy!
What are you doin'?!
Foul!
Foul ball!
They got two on the ball.
It's our ball.
All right. Ready?
Wait for the whistle.
You understand?
[Whistles]
What's the idea?
He didn't do nothin'!
What's the big idea, rocky?
That's what i'm askin' you.
Play accordin' to the rules,
Or i'll slap some sense into you.
I didn't do nothin'.
If you didn't do nothin', don't do it again.
Come on. Give me that ball.
Here we go.
[Whistles]
Hey, bim!
Hey, where you runnin'?
Personal foul.
Free throw over here.
I didn't do nothin'.
[Whistles]
Foul!
Foul? What did he do, hit me?
Foul.
Ball over here.
Get him!
Gimme-
What's the matter?
What are you doin', playin' for the other team?
Are you guys gonna play accordin' to rules or not?
Ok, rocky.
Accordin' to the rules, fellas.
Got me? Accordin' to the rules.
We'll beat them right!
Play the ball.
Boy, what a slaughter.
What do you mean 32-8?
It was a close game.
You just won by a nose.
All you guys, shower down.
All those nickels.
You. You. You.
Hey, rocky...
Put 'em in there.
Somebody stole my nickel.
Those guys played too rough.
Where's my nickel?
Who put those slugs in there?
Not me.
Come on.
Think i'd gyp you?
Rocky, you give us some practice tomorrow,
And we'll mop up these mugs.
I don't know nothin' about that.
You better ask father.
Father, you give us another chance tomorrow?
Give us some practice.
Be a sport.
Promise there'll be no fouls.
Meet me here tomorrow.
I'll try to arrange a game.
Can you get smaller kids?
Oh, boy!
You didn't know it was there, did you?
No.
[Knocking on door]
Aha! Just in time.
Thanks.
Say, you goin' home?
Yes.
I'll wait for you.
Hey, rock, you want to watch out for that dame.
She's a jinx.
She put her last guy
6 foot under.
Anybody ask you?
I didn't say a word.
Who's carryin' your books for you now?
Nobody.
I heard somewhere
About you bein' mixed up with a guy.
Who was that?
There was only one-
My husband.
Oh. Took care of him, huh?
Yeah, about four years ago.
What happened?
What usually happens when a boy gets mixed up
With a bunch of would-Be tough guys.
He was a swell kid when we first got married,
But he tried to give me a lot more than he could get
Driving a cab.
Partly my fault.
I didn't stop him.
Well, he got in deeper and deeper.
Finally, one night,
He tried to shoot it out with the cops.
That's what always happens, isn't it?
Maybe, yeah, with guys who don't know their business.
I think i got somethin' in my eye.
Can you see anything?
No.
Got a handkerchief?
Yeah, sure.
Nah. Nah.
It's all right.
What's the difference?
I've seen everything.
You know, you were right the other day.
This neighborhood don't change much.
Know that?
There's too much traffic.
We gotta wait for a better opening.
Trail him slow.
We'll get him.
Well, here we are.
And here we go.
Look, honey, make out this is where you live.
Say good night to me, and go on inside.
What's the matter?
Stop askin' questions.
Go on in.
Yeah, sure.
Good night, rocky,
And thanks for bringing me home.
Rocky, please be careful.
[Horns honking]
He just went in the drugstore.
Can i help you, sir?
I don't think so.
Uh, cherry coke.
You go in and keep the place cleared out.
I don't like the setup.
We gotta figure out somethin'.
The guy's heel is in too good a spot.
We go in the front,
He swings around and starts poppin'.
It's no good.
Good evening.
Good evening.
We get him in the phone booth
Where he can't move.
Hop in the delicatessen.
Ring the drugstore and ask for sullivan.
Leave the receiver off the hook.
If he falls for it, we're set.
Ok.
Got a phone?
How about my prescription?
When'd you leave it?
Yesterday.
My brother brought it.
What is the name?
Peterson.
Excuse me.
I'll see.
[Telephone ringing]
Hello.
Nadler drugstore.
Who?
Just a minute.
You rocky sullivan?
Yeah.
You're wanted on the telephone.
Hello.
Rocky sullivan speakin'.
Hold the line.
He fell for it.
Ed, hop in the car and keep close.
Let's go.
Get in that back room.
Keep your mouth shut and your eyes closed.
Get it?
Come on. Get goin'.
Just a minute.
Give me that canister.
Now, back up.
Come on. Faster.
Now, get in there, and get in deep.
Answer that phone.
[Woman screams]
[Woman screaming]
[Indistinct chatter]
[Siren]
Right over there, officer!
What do you know about this?
I never saw him before.
He came in, asked for a prescription.
Said he left it the day before.
I couldn't remember.
He said his name was peterson.
Clean it out!
Clear out!
Get out of here.
Come on. Hurry it up.
Can you see him?
There must be
100 holes in him.
Who do you think done it, soapy?
[Imitating machine gun]
Clear out of here!
Who do you think you're pushin'?
Hello. Frazier?
This is bugs.
Everything's fixed.
We got him.
That's good.
All right, drop out of sight
For a couple of days.
Rocky.
Yeah. Rocky.
I ain't dead yet.
Gimme those keys.
Get goin'.
Open it up.
I didn't have anything to do with it, rocky.
I swear to you i didn't.
I ought to give it to you right in the head,
But you owe me a hundred grand.
I got to get that first.
I've only got about 2,000 here.
I can get you the rest later.
Shut up and get it open.
Get away from there.
Savin' these, too, huh?
You're a smart lawyer, frazier.
A little too smart for your own good.
Two grand.
Yeah, that's all there is.
There's some securities there and some bonds.
Get out of here.
Get over there, sit down.
There.
"Fourth street national,
"Farmers and merchants,
Industrial trust,
You done very all right, frazier.
I'm mighty proud of you.
Why shouldn't i be?
We're partners, ain't we?
Of course, rocky.
Of course.
Just like we said three years ago.
Now, let's see-
That's nothing.
Sit down and relax.
Ah, we're collectin' autographs, huh?
Some pretty important-
Some very important people.
Some officials here might be interesting
To know more about.
You know just about everybody in town.
You made 'em sign, too.
That's the way you held the club over 'em, huh?
I'm gonna take this and study up.
One partner should know what the other is doin'.
What's keefer's number?
Circle 0500.
His private number.
That's it.
Dial it.
Now, look. You're gonna get on there
And tell keefer i'm comin' up there in the mornin'.
He's to give me that 100 grand.
And no wrong cracks,
Or i'll cut you off short.
Hello, mac.
This is rocky.
Yeah.
Surprise, surprise.
No, i ain't down the morgue.
That's one of your own boys.
Frazier's here.
He wants to talk.
Hello. Mac?
Rocky will be up the el toro in the morning.
About 11:00.
That'll give him time to get to the bank. time to get to the bank.
I want you to take $100,000 out of my personal account
And give it to him.
What's up?
Is he holding you?
Tell him yes.
Yes. You've got to do it, mac.
You understand?
You've got to do it.
Ok.
I'll give it to him.
And tell him no slip-Ups.
And no slip-Ups.
It's very important to me.
Ok, ok.
I said i'd give it to him.
Mac, i get you out of bed?
Oh, i'm so sorry.
I think he's sore.
Morning, gentlemen.
Nice day for a murder.
Where's frazier?
Where's that 100 grand?
Think we're gonna pay off, huh?
Certainly. If i don't get that dough in three minutes,
Frazier will be splashed all over my hideout.
You don't expect to get away with this.
Why not?
I guess we can make you talk.
Uh-Huh.
All right.
Suppose you don't make me talk.
I give you a wrong number.
Maybe another wrong number.
Meanwhile, frazier's watchin' the clock,
And waitin' for the phone to ring.
How much you like frazier?
Give him the dough.
Well, look-
Give him the dough.
Look. Suppose you don't produce frazier.
What do i want with him?
All right. 100 grand.
Now give me a phone and an outside line.
[Telephone ringing]
Hello. Poleano vegetable market.
Hello. Yeah, this is rocky.
Hey, look, when i walk past your window,
Call that number i gave you.
But don't call
If you see me smokin' a cigarette.
That means i'm bein' followed.
Hello. Hello.
What you talk-A?
You crazy?
Yeah. Yeah, i got it.
Yeah. Bye.
See, when i walk past that window,
Frazier will be sprung... unless i'm followed.
Ok. Beat it, and let him go.
[Door slams]
We'll get him as soon as we see frazier.
I got a better idea.
Get me the tyson street police station.
Hello. This is mac keefer.
Let me talk to buckley.
Hello, buck? Mac.
Yeah.
Say, listen, i'm gonna do something for you.
I'm gonna give you a hot tip.
Last night, rocky sullivan snatched frazier.
I just paid off
100 grand to him.
What are you doin', kiddin' me?
Yeah. Yeah, i get you.
Thanks for the tip.
Ok!
What you doin'?
I don't get you.
Yeah.
What's the idea
Of bringing the cops in on it?
Because i'm not a mug.
I'm smart, see?
Sure, you'd like rough stuff.
Why? When you can do it nice and legal?
No trouble, no fuss.
The top boys will like it.
Why don't you guys use your brains like i do?
[Horn honks]
Soapy, my room, quick.
Where's rocky sullivan's room?
Woman: upstairs.
Get out of here without the stairs.
Drop it where it'll be safe.
And don't open it.
Ok, rocky.
This is it.
[Kicking door]
Come on, sullivan.
Open up.
Come in. It's open.
[Kicking door]
How are you, rocky?
Hello. Why all the artillery?
Readin' your life story.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
You forgot the garbage can.
What'd you do with it?
You tell me what you're looking for,
Maybe i can help you.
The dough.
What dough?
Get your coat on.
Speed it up, rocky.
You're not so funny.
[Chuckles] it's killin' me.
Uh-Huh.
[Boys yelling excitedly]
Quiet! Quiet!
What'd the cops jug him for?
He didn't have time to tell me nothin'.
He just gives me this and he tells me to hide it.
What do you think's in it?
How should i know?
Let's open it and see.
You want to lose your hand?
Hey, what's the idea?
Rocky said not to open it. See?
All right, all right, i was just askin'.
How'd you get away with it?
Them cops passed me right on the stairs.
They don't know nothin'.
And me with this in me shirt.
You're all wrong, boys.
There was no snatch.
Me and frazier was away on a business trip.
Spill. We've got the dope anyway.
Let me call my lawyer.
Oh, sure.
Who is your lawyer?
Frazier.
Hello, jim.
Hello, mac.
I don't know how you feel. You look terrible.
It wasn't a picnic in the cellar
With the rats and dirt.
That'll teach you to leave the rough stuff to me.
Is it my fault if your apes can't get the right man?
You didn't put anybody after sullivan, did you?
No. You did that once too often.
I'm lettin' the coppers take care of him.
You what?!
I tipped them off that he snatched you.
I just got word from buckley he picked him up.
That's just what you shouldn't have done.
But it's already done.
You don't understand.
Sullivan picked me up at my home.
He's got everything that was in my safe-
Account books, receipts, names, addresses,
Bank books, everything.
If he's prosecuted for this kidnapping, he'll talk.
He's got evidence to back it up.
He'll tear this whole town wide open.
We gotta pull him out of there.
If anybody pulled a boner, you did.
Hello. Get me buckley.
Let me talk to him.
Hello. Hello?
Buckley?
This is mac.
Say, listen, you'll have to spring sullivan.
Yes, i just learned it's all been a little mistake.
A little mistake?
What do you mean?
A mistake in the pig's eye!
You can't pull a thing like this on me.
See you soon, rocky.
Not if i can help it.
Drive west.
Extry! Extry!
Read all about it!
Lawyer kidnapped!
Extry! Extry!
Lawyer kidnapped!
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Extry! Extry!
Two-Gun rocky held!
Extry! Extry!
"Two-Gun rocky sullivan, well-Known gangster and bad man,
"Perpetrated the snatch and received the money.
"Rocky sullivan evidently returned
"Directly to his boyhood haunts following his release
"And had been in the district only a few days
"Before he kidnapped james frazier,
The prominent attorney and playboy. "
Ransom asked was 100,000 smackers.
You don't find that in poor boxes.
Leave it to rocky.
Hey, i'll bet that dough's in the envelope.
Maybe it is.
So what?
So the kid has an idea,
And if rocky does go up, it all belongs to us.
That envelope goes to rocky, see?
Even if it got to wait 20 years.
You won't have to wait that long.
Rocky!
Hiya, rocky.
Glad to see you. We was just talkin' about you.
Hey, what happened?
Did you break out?
No. I walked out.
It said in the papers that-
Don't believe what you read in the papers.
First you're in, and then you're out.
They certainly can't hold you.
Come on, where's that envelope?
I got it.
I got it.
All right, let's have it.
Wait a minute, rocky.
I'll get it for you.
Here you are, rocky.
Just like you give it to me.
That's the 100 grand the paper said you got.
Askin' questions again, huh?
Listen, some of these days,
You're gonna stick your nose,
And you're gonna get somethin' in it.
I only thought it was-
Shut up!
Now, look, you don't know
Anything about this, see?
No. No. I don't know nothin'.
But you do know what guys get who talk.
Yeah.
Huh?
Yeah, yeah.
Now, look, that goes for the rest of you.
You understand?
Certainly.
Sure!
All right.
Now we're pals.
Put her there, rocky.
All right, soapy.
Here you are.
[Whistle]
Cut that up any way you like.
It's ok.
I just saw it made.
Thanks, rocky.
You don't have to worry
About the guys talkin', either.
We once had a squealer in the gang,
But now he ain't got no teeth.
I'll see you in a couple days.
So long, rocky!
Bye, rock!
Have a good time!
Come on, guys!
Yeah!
You want to see what it's like?
Yeah!
Here's your cut.
Come on.
Give me some of that.
50 bucks! Wow!
50 bucks! Wow!
And the same for the rest of youse, too.
Oh, boy.
50 simoleons.
My old man never made that much dough
In his whole life
Workin' for the department of sanitation.
How much you got there, soapy?
About 100.
100? How come?
That's twice as much as i got.
You want to make somethin' out of it?
He deserves it.
He hid all the stuff.
You pull in your ears.
Say, what are we gonna do with it?
This is burnin' a hole right through my hands.
I'm gonna get me a pair
Of chromium-Plated brass knuckles.
Come on! Let's go!
[Excited chatter]
[Knock on door]
Can i come in, rocky?
Yeah. Wait a minute, jerry.
Just a second.
I want to dry me hands.
Hello, jerry.
Hello, rocky.
Whaddya hear?
Whaddya say?
What do you say?
You gave me a terrific scare.
Huh?
Before i finished reading about you being arrested,
There were headlines saying you were out.
There was nothin' to it.
You know how it is with a guy with a record.
Haul him in because they have nothing else to do.
What are you worrying about?
Plenty.
What's up?
Soapy and the boys had a return game
At the gym today,
And they haven't shown up.
Thought you might know where they were.
How would i know?
What am i, a nursemaid?
No, rocky.
I didn't mean that.
Thought they might be up here
Celebrating your release.
With them, it's kind of a hero worship.
You can't blame 'em for that, can you?
Rocky, why don't you tell me what it's all about?
Look, jerry, i've been answerin'
A lot of questions all mornin', see?
A lot of 'em.
Frazier and me were just away
On a little business trip, that's all.
Some dope wanted to start some trouble
And happened upon the cops at the same time.
Spread a false alarm, that's all.
I'm glad it wasn't any more than that.
[Knock on door]
Hello, laury!
Whaddya say?
This looks like it's gonna be a big day.
I have to admit, i was pretty worried.
That sounds very nice to hear.
Well, father,
I finally located our precious angels.
You did? Where?
Over in murphy's poolroom.
What?
Yeah, soapy and the gang.
They're passing out beer to the neighborhood kids.
Throwing dollar bills around like confetti.
Wonder where they got the money.
You might ask them.
Well, i'm gonna be going, rocky.
So soon?
Coming, laury?
No, father.
I want to stay and talk to rocky for a while.
When will i see you, rocky?
I'll catch up with you.
Ok. Bye.
Well, rocky, i guess-
Now, wait a minute.
You're the kind of gal that's smart enough
To mind her own business.
Am i right or wrong?
Don't worry.
I know all the rules.
Get your 10 here!
All bets covered!
Where'd you get the dough, pasty?
We wrote to santa claus, see.
Then when we woke up this morning,
There it was in our socks.
All bets covered.
Come on, boys.
[Men arguing]
Give me another one.
What do you mean, another one?
You tryin' to gyp the kid or somethin'?
He owes me five bucks.
Shut up!
Dirty tables aggravate me.
You're gonna make this shot, you know.
Put your eightball on the corner.
Ok.
All right.
Hey, bury that beef, will ya?
Pull in your head and get that off the table!
Got a threeball off the corner.
Nice shot, boy!
Eight bucks!
My mother has to work almost all week
To make this much.
Give, give, give!
All right.
All right.
All gamblers die broke.
Hey, soapy, you promised us
Another round of beers if you won.
Ok, go on.
Bring up another case.
What's the difference?
Those chumps are payin' for it.
What is this, a raid?
No. Maybe they're gonna make
A sunday school out of it.
Come on.
I'll take two.
Give me two.
Aren't you boys goin' over to the gym
And start that game?
Sure, father.
We just wanted to see
What was going on in here.
Come on, joe.
Come on, kids.
Let's go to the gym.
Givin' a party, soapy?
Everybody invited?
Yeah.
Why don't you give it over at the gym?
'Cause i'm havin' it here.
What about that return game you asked for?
Hey, small change,
Double that bet on that shot, ok?
Ok. It's your murder.
Where'd you get this money you've been spendin'?
Hasn't anything i've told you
For the last three years meant anything to you?
What makes you think hanging around hoodlums,
Spending this kind of money with a lot of hoodlums
Is gonna get you anyplace but jail?
Come on, fellas, what do you say?
Why not go with me,
And we'll figure this whole thing out?
Come on, let's go over to the gym.
How about it, swing?
I don't know, father.
I got a sore leg.
What do you say, bim?
Ah, father, there ain't no future
In playin' basketball.
Well, how about you fellas?
Can't a guy even have any fun?
It's a waste of time.
Look, father...
We don't fall for
That pie-In-The-Sky stuff no more, see?
Ha ha!
What's the matter?
Can't you get 'em to go to heaven with ya?
You got the wrong slant, honey.
You got a bad break a long time ago,
And you're still figurin'
That's the only way things can go.
You've been readin' stuff about "crime don't pay. "
Don't be a sucker.
That's for yaps
And small-Timers on shoestrings.
You belong in the big-Shot class.
Both of us do.
I wonder.
Got any glad rags-
Something fancy,
An evening gown?
A very old one.
Get it on. We'll do some celebratin'.
What will we be celebrating, rocky?
All this!
You don't get
On the front pages every day.
You don't get away from the cops every day, rocky.
You do if you're smart. Come here.
You see those white lights up there?
Huh? That's where you belong,
And that's where you're goin'.
Come on, i'll show you
Who this town's made for.
I hope that old gown of mine hangs together.
[Music playing]
Wants an eight.
Wants an eight.
You gotta bet!
36 red! Place your bets.
Give the lady a stack of black chips.
For whom?
For me.
Rocky sullivan.
Oh, yes. Sure, of course.
There you are, baby.
Try your luck.
I got some business to attend to.
I'll be back in a little while.
But, rocky, i'm not lucky.
Don't be afraid.
Let your hair down.
Have fun. Go ahead.
How much are these?
$50 each.
Change them to dollar chips.
But mr. Sullivan wants black.
I don't like black.
Oh, you don't like black.
Seeing as how jim owed you the dough
And it being a misunderstanding,
We decided to call it square
With no hard feelings,
Especially now you're in the know.
You boys really want to talk business?
Ok, let's talk.
Look here, rocky, what about those accounts
You took from my safe?
I figured it was good insurance,
In case you boys change your minds.
What do you want, rocky?
Nothin' from you, mac,
Just my original agreement with frazier-
50% of his share of everything.
That sounds fair enough, jim.
All right. It's a deal.
I'm gonna take very good care of those accounts.
I wouldn't do anything i'd be sorry for
Because i'm gonna pay very special attention
To those books.
You understand?
If it's a deal between you guys,
It's just like it was on paper.
I always do everything legal.
Oh, yeah, i know that.
Now, partners, i'll have my accountant go over the books
To make sure you boys ain't cheating.
Fair enough?
Yeah.
Ok.
How long do you think
I'll let that guy sit in my chair?
As long as he hangs onto that information.
You like this place?
Sure.
Why wouldn't i?
Just got a piece of it.
Rocky.
Yeah?
Maybe you are smart enough.
Baby, how'd you like
To give up that two-
For-A-Nickel job
And move in here?
Doin' what?
Just sittin' around, lookin' pretty,
Dance a little, play a little.
Kind of a hostess.
Give you $100 a week and expenses.
It'll be very nice to have
At least one friend in this place.
[Knocking on door]
Come in.
Yes, mrs. Mcgee, what is it?
I've had your lunch waitin' since noon.
Then this package came by messenger.
I thought maybe it was important,
So i brought it up.
All right.
Thank you.
Is there anything wrong, father?
No, no, nothing.
Oh, i won't have any lunch.
If i'd known that this morning,
I could have saved some money.
You wait. I'll tell him you're here.
Uh, make yourself at home.
Thanks.
Hi, jerry. Whaddya hear? Whaddya say?
What are you doin', tryin' your luck?
Yes, i'd like to,
But i haven't got any money.
Except this.
And it's not mine.
Where did you get ahold of that?
Where did you?
Huh?
Here, rocky. Thanks, but i can't accept it.
You silly or somethin'?
That ain't mine.
I know it isn't.
That's why i can't take it.
What is this?
You flash this wad on me,
Then try to tell me the dough is mine.
You've got a great poker face, rocky,
But don't forget i've known that face a long time.
I know you forced frazier to get you $100,000.
Everybody knows it.
What's the difference
Where the dough came from?
Frazier owed it to me.
It was mine.
Better you get a chunk of it than him.
Suppose the dough is hot?
Nobody knows that but you and me.
That's just it.
Oh, come on.
Don't be such an angel.
You want to get that center built?
Go ahead!
Get it started!
I don't want to build on rotten foundations.
Ah, don't be a sucker!
All right, rocky.
Supposing i take the money,
I kid myself that it's a means to an end.
Well, it isn't.
It never will be.
Inside the center, my boys will be clean,
And outside, they'd be surrounded
By the same rotten corruption and crime and criminals.
Yes, yourself included.
Criminals on all sides
For my boys to look up to and revere
And respect, admire and imitate.
What earthly good is it for me to teach them
Honesty is the best policy
When all around, they see dishonesty is a better policy?
The hoodlum and gangster
Is looked up to with the same respect
As the successful businessman or popular hero-
You, the fraziers, the keefers,
And all the rest of those rotten politicians
You've got in the palm of your hand.
Yes, and you've got my boys, too.
Whatever i teach them, you show me up.
You show them the easiest way,
The quickest way is with a racket or a gun.
Well, it's so, ain't it?
[Drops cards]
Yes, it's so... god help us.
You see, rocky...
I thought i could solve my problems...
Problems with my boys-
Which, after all, they are-
From the bottom up.
But i can't.
I've gotta start from the top down.
Yeah? How?
I'll tell you how.
I'm gonna use your case
Of kidnapping frazier
As a crowbar to uncover this cesspool.
I'm gonna force the law, corrupt or not,
To indict, prosecute and bring to the light of day
This entire filthy affair.
There's gonna be
A lot of people stepped on, rocky,
And if you happen to get in the way,
I'll be sorry, but you'll be stepped on
Just as hard.
All right, jerry, go to it.
But you've got as much chance of gettin' an indictment
As i have of gettin' into bible society.
You'll find nobody cares about the whole thing.
You'll find 'em laughing, end up with blind alleys.
But go ahead, kid.
If i'm in your way,
Keep on steppin' just as hard.
For being honest
And for old times' sake,
There's one favor i'm gonna have to ask you.
Maybe i won't be able to return it.
Well, go ahead.
Anything you say.
Soapy and those kids-
Give 'em a break, will ya?
Don't offer 'em any more money.
Don't encourage them to... admire you.
All right.
I'll do that.
Sure, you will.
Father connelly, i'd like to help you,
But we can't get away with it.
The organization is too powerful to fight.
You know what you're asking of me.
Yes, mr. White.
The other papers have gone to great lengths
To explain the risks to me.
You'll go into the fight personally,
Devote your full time to it?
Believe me, nothing would please me more.
Very well, father connelly, i'm with you.
The presswill back you to the limit.
Thank you, and i appreciate it.
Get me the inside on frazier and keefer's bank accounts.
I don't care where you get the dope.
Pap, get information on frazier before he got to this town,
If he'd been mixed up with sullivan.
Jenkins, find out how many of keefer's men have been sprung
Since frazier moved in.
Why are you hounding rocky?
Why are you trying to send him to prison for life?
You can't do that to rocky.
I won't let you.
It's not his fault, father.
He was just a kid
Who made a mistake
And got sent to reform school.
They made a criminal out of him,
But he's not really bad.
You know that.
And whatever they've done to him,
No matter what he is now,
Whether he's right or wrong,
We both love him, father.
Yes, laury, we both love him.
I've loved him
Since we were kids
6 years old.
We worked together, fought together...
Stole together.
Oh, i'm not blaming rocky
For what he is today.
But for the grace of god,
There walk i.
I'd do anything for him, laury,
Anything in the world to help him.
I'd give my life if i thought
It'd do any good.
But it wouldn't.
You see, laury,
There's all those other kids,
Hundreds of them,
In the streets, in bad environment,
Whom i don't want to see
Grow up like rocky did.
I can't sacrifice them for rocky.
You see, laury,
They have lives, too.
I can't throw them away.
I can't.
Connelly: the very fact that countless thousands of you
Are listening in tonight
Is proof to these cynics that the public does care
And does propose to do something
About the appalling conditions i have tried to describe.
Do not doubt that our efforts have not struck panic
Into the cesspool of official and near-Official corruption.
Yeah, i'm shaking like a leaf.
This very afternoon, i was approached
With a sugar-Coated proposition,
A bribe offered me by this corrupt officialdom-
$100,000 for the building and equipment
Of a recreation center in my parish
If i would agree to refrain from further attacks,
If i would sabotage this campaign,
If i would shut my eyes, stop my ears,
And hold my tongue.
But building a playground to shield my boys from crime
Is not rooting out the crime itself.
We must rid ourselves of the criminal parasites
That feed on us.
We must wipe out those we have ignorantly elected
And those who manipulate this diseased officialdom
Behind locked doors.
Tonight, we have in our power to ask definitely
Incriminating questions of these officials
And the power to demand satisfactory answers.
What really is the truth
In the case of the racketeer and gunman rocky sullivan?
Why did the police release him so suddenly
With all the evidence they had against him?
Why did the notorious mac keefer
Pay sullivan
$100,000 in cash,
And what political sword does he hold
Over the trembling hands of district attorneys,
Judges, and police officials?
But tomorrow, the new grand jury will meet,
And these questions must be answered.
Therefore, i ask all of you listening in...
You thought you could buy him off?
I told you you were wastin' your time.
We ain't wastin' any more time.
That was that guy's last chance.
We're gonna take care of him tonight.
Ah, you're talkin' through your hat.
You can't bump off a priest. Forget it.
I'll forget it tomorrow morning
When he's floating down the river.
Get this straight, sullivan.
Even if he is an old pal of yours,
I'm still runnin' the works.
I'm not taking orders from you
All of a sudden.
He's not gonna appear
At no grand jury tomorrow shooting off his mouth.
I say he gets it tonight.
Not if i'm around.
Wait a minute, gentlemen.
There's no sense in running
Too far ahead of ourselves.
Don't forget,
There are all kinds of grand juries,
And there's all kinds of ways
Of handling them.
That's what you got me for.
If you can do a thing legally-
Sure. I don't care how we stop that guy,
I only want him stopped.
Then leave it to me.
You know, this is no penny ante reform wave
This priest is starting.
This is a tidal wave,
And unless we stop it quick,
We're gonna find ourselves in the pen.
Look, frazier, nobody knows better than me
That we're in a spot.
I know that.
And, mac, you can settle it any way you like.
But lay off the rough stuff, see? That's out.
I'll see you later.
Frazier: don't worry, mac.
I've got an idea how we can stymie that grand jury.
That preacher won't get to first base.
I hope you were stalling.
I meant what i said.
Sure. Connelly's, first of all, rocky's pal.
Second, he's a priest.
So what?
Where would rocky keep those accounts?
With that priest,
With instructions to make 'em public
If anything happens to rocky.
That ain't news to me.
That's why he can be a wise guy.
If we're gonna get that preacher tonight,
Why not get those accounts, too?
Yeah.
Only this time, no drugstore mistakes.
I'm taking care of this job myself.
Get blackie up here right away.
I don't care how you handle sullivan,
But it's got to look like an accident
With that priest.
Leave that to me.
Rocky!
Don't! Don't!
I'll do anything.
No, you won't. You've had your last chance.
Take this with you-
I never let go of those papers.
All you had to do was bump me off.
[Women screaming]
[Women screaming]
Come on, stand back.
We'll shoot it off.
[Police whistle blowing]
Gunfight at the el toro.
Is father connelly still there?
I must talk to him.
[Sirens]
[Sirens]
Well?
Rocky sullivan, captain.
He got frazier and keefer.
They've chased him up on the roof.
Macmahon, throw a cordon around the block.
Come on, men, with me.
Here's the microphone, captain.
O'flannigan, hook up those searchlights
And play them on the building.
Galavan, cover the warehouse skylights.
[Coughing]
There he is!
Sullivan, are you coming out,
Or must we smoke you out?
All right, give him the tear gas.
Please.
Captain... i'm father connelly, an old friend of rocky's.
He'll come out for me.
He'll listen to me.
This is a job for the police, father.
He'll need a priest later.
You want to kill him, or do you want him alive?
What do you mean by that?
He'll listen to me.
Won't you let me talk to him?
Go ahead.
Thank you.
Rocky, this is jerry.
Please come out.
Tell him we'll get him anyway,
Even if we blow up the whole block.
Rocky, you've got to come out!
I'm coming up.
Officers, hold your fire.
Rocky?
Rocky.
What are you doin' up here?
Go on. Get outta here!
Beat it!
I'm coming in, rocky.
You want your skull full of lead?
Get outta here!
I thought you were smarter than to stick your kisser
Into a place like this.
I couldn't watch them shoot you down, rocky.
You're covered from every angle.
Your only chance is to give yourself up.
You're through, rocky.
You're finished.
Yeah, i was until you stepped into it.
Father connelly, are you all right?
Go on.
Get over there
And tell them to call off their dogs.
I'm goin' down with you.
[Coughing]
Sure, you are.
[Coughing]
Call off your men, all of them!
Sullivan's coming out with me!
Hold your fire, men, but stand by.
Let's go.
[Coughing]
Come on, get 'em up, jerry.
Sorry it has to be you, kid,
But get goin'.
Get away from there, or i'll let him have it!
Turn back around.
Come on.
Get 'em up high. High!
Get back, all of you,
Or i'll give it to him right in the head!
Back!
Duck, jerry!
[Gunfire]
Got him in the leg.
Empty.
Heh heh. So is your thick skull, copper.
Extra! Identified killer!
Papers! Get your papers!
Extra!
Extra! Get your papers!
Identified killer!
Gee, that's tough.
Boy, i'd like to get my hands
On those squealers.
"Special prosecutor for trial of rocky today.
State builds strong case. "
That dope of a governor's so scared of rocky,
He's appointin' a special shyster.
"Rocky guilty; to die!"
Gee, you think they'll burn him
In the chair?
Nah. They can't build no death house
That'll hold rocky.
You mean he'll blow it and make a getaway?
Just wait, that's all.
Just wait.
He'll show those mugs how to die in a big way.
Sure, he will. They'll never make him crack.
There's nothin' yellow about rocky.
Remember what he said at the trial?
Said he'd spit in their eye.
He'll do it, too.
He'll laugh at 'em.
Sure, he'll show those phonies up.
Guard: sullivan.
Rocky.
Father connelly has received permission
To be with you.
He just arrived.
You'll see him, won't you?
Yeah, sure, send him in, but tell him
None of that incense and holy water stuff,
Will ya?
Whatever you say, rocky.
Did you enjoy your dinner, mr. Sullivan?
Yeah, it was pretty good,
Only the meat was kinda burnt,
And i don't like burnt meat. Do you?
Listen, big shot, you got only 10 minutes to go,
So don't try stalling around
With that priest pal of yours.
[Spits]
10 minutes till that hot seat.
I'm gonna tell the electrician
To give it to you slow and easy, wise guy.
Somebody get this screw out of here!
Come on! Take him out of there!
Get him out of there!
[Inmates yelling]
Let him alone, herbert.
Quiet.
Hey!
Quiet, now!
Quiet.
How are you, father?
How much time?
About 10 minutes.
Hiya, jerry.
Whaddya hear?
Whaddya say?
Hello, rocky.
How do you feel?
Like a million.
Uh...
How is soapy and the kids?
Pulling for you all the way.
As long as there's the slightest hope
From the governor.
They'll be easier to handle with me
Out of the way, won't they?
That's up to you, rocky.
Huh?
We haven't got a lot of time.
I want to ask one last favor.
There's not much i can do, kid.
Yes, there is, rocky-
Perhaps more than you could do
Under any other circumstances,
If you have the courage, and i know you have.
You mean walkin' in there?
That's not gonna take much.
I know that, rocky.
It's like sittin' a barber chair.
They're gonna ask,
"anything to say?"
I'll say, "give me a haircut, a shave
And one of those nice new electric massages. "
But you're not afraid, rocky?
No. They'd like me to be.
I can't oblige 'em, kid.
You know, jerry, i think to be afraid,
You got to have a heart.
I don't think i got one.
I had that cut out of me a long time ago.
Suppose i asked you to have the heart,
To be scared?
What do you mean?
Suppose the guards dragged you out
Screaming for mercy?
Suppose you went to the chair yellow?
Yellow? Say, what's the matter with you, jerry?
You just been worryin' about my courage.
I know that.
This is a different kind of courage...
The kind that's...
Well, it's born in heaven.
Not the courage of heroics and bravado,
The kind that you and i and god know about.
I still don't know what you mean.
Look, rocky, before i came up here,
The boys saw me off on the train,
Soapy and several of the others.
You can imagine what they told me.
"Father, tell rocky to show the world
"What he's made of.
"Tell him not to be afraid,
To go out laughing and-"
What do you want?
I'm not gonna let them down,
If that's what's worryin' you.
I want you to let them down.
You've been a hero to these kids
And hundreds of others all through your life.
Now you're gonna be
A glorified hero in death,
And i want to prevent that, rocky.
They've got to despise your memory.
They've got to be ashamed of you.
You're askin' me to pull an act, turn yellow,
So those kids will think i'm no good?
You're askin' me to throw away
The only thing i got left,
The only thing they haven't been able to take away from me,
To give those newspaper sob sisters
A chance to say,
"another rat turned yellow. "
You and i will know you're not.
You're askin' me to crawl on my belly
The last thing i do in life.
I know what i'm asking,
And i'm asking
Because being kids together
Gave me the idea that you might like
To join hands with me
And save some other boys from ending up here.
You're asking too much.
You want to help those kids,
Figure out some other way!
It's impossible to do it
Without your help, rocky.
I can't reach all of those boys,
Hero-Worshiping kids all over the country.
Don't give me that humanity stuff.
I had enough in the courtroom.
Told everything i knew.
Named names,
Gave the lowdown on the whole dirty mess.
What more do you want?
What i've always wanted, rocky-
Straighten yourself out with god.
Outside of that,
I can't ask for anything else.
Well, don't!
It's time, rocky.
Are you ready?
Yeah.
You figure on goin' in with me?
I'd like to, rocky, that is, if-
You can if you wish.
Do you mind, father?
Certainly not.
That's better.
Be kind of lonesome goin' down that last mile.
Oh, uh, promise me somethin'.
Promise me you won't let me hear you pray.
I promise you won't hear me.
Get away from me, screw,
Or i'll bust your face in.
It'll be the last face you see, big shot,
And it'll be laughing at you.
Don't get near me now.
I'll spit in your eye again.
Herbert, stand back.
Thompson, take care of him.
Lay off. I don't need anybody.
Come on.
Inmate: that-A-Boy, rocky.
Pick your own company.
So long, rocky.
We won't be long.
So long, rocky.
Rocky, please.
No.
So long, kid.
Good-Bye, rocky.
May god have mercy on you.
Oh, i don't want to die!
Oh, please!
[Sobbing] i don't want to die!
Oh, please! Please!
Ah, don't make me burn in hell!
[Gasp]
Oh, please, let go of me!
Please, don't kill me!
Oh, don't kill me, please!
[Sobbing]
Man: ok, hold him down there!
[Sobbing] no!
Please, don't kill me!
Ohh-
The yellow rat was gonna spit in my eye.
"At the fatal stroke of 11 p. M.,
"Rocky was led
"Through the little green door of death.
"No sooner had he entered the death chamber
"Than he tore himself from the guards' grasp,
"Flung himself on the floor
"Screaming for mercy.
"And as they dragged him to the electric chair,
"He crawled around on the concrete floor
"With agonized shrieks.
In contrast to his former heroics... "
"Rocky sullivan died a coward. "
I don't believe it.
I don't believe one rotten word of it.
I don't believe it, either.
If anybody says it's true, i'll...
He couldn't die that way, not rocky!
He couldn't!
It's all lies!
Lies, i tell ya!
Hey, fellas.
Here's father connelly.
Let's ask him.
He oughta know.
He'll tell us everything.
You were there, father.
You saw everything.
What happened?
Did rocky die like they said,
Like a yellow rat?
It's true, boys.
Every word of it.
He died like they said.
All right, fellas.
Let's go and...
Say a prayer for a boy
Who couldn't run as fast as i could.

With his cleaver's blade so true
He'll make mincemeat out of you!
You're out.
I told you to stop singing that awful song!
Didn't you hear me?
That same cursed song over and over!
Dear me, that's heavy.
What's the matter?
I told those kids to stop singing that awful song, but they sing it all day long.
As if we haven't heard enough of that murderer already.
Ah, leave 'em alone.
As long as we can hear 'em singing, at least we know they're still there.
Yes, I guess you're right.
PUBLIC SCHOOL
10,000 MARKS' REWARD -
WHO IS THE MURDERER?
"Little Kurt Klawitzky and his sister Klara have been missing since June 11th.
Evidence leads us to believe the children were victims of a crime similar to that committed last fall against the Doering siblings".
What a pretty ball you have there.
What's your name?
Elsie Beckmann.
Didn't Elsie come with you?
No, she didn't.
Pretty!
Thank you.
A thrilling new chapter, Mrs. Beckmann.
Passionate and moving.
Just a moment, Mr. Gehrke.
Tell me, Mr. Gehrke.
Have you seen little Elsie?
No. Didn't she just come up the stairs?
No, she's not home yet.
She won't be long now.
Good-bye.
Good-bye, Mr. Gehrke.
Extra! Extra!
Extra! Extra!
No, I can't give change!
Extra!
Makes you afraid to send your kids to school!
Who is the murderer?
"Because the police did not publish my first letter,
I am writing now directly to the press!
Proceed with your investigations.
All will soon be confirmed.
But I'm not done yet!"
10,000 marks' reward.
- Christ, here we go again!
- This is horrible!
The print's too small.
We can't read it.
You in front, read it out loud!
- Let him read!
- Hey! Quiet!
"The terror in our town has found a new victim".
Louder!
We can't hear a word!
"Certain evidence leads us to believe
that this is the same murderer
who has already claimed eight victims from among our city's children.
We must emphasize once again that it is, now more than ever, every mother and father's sacred duty to alert their children to this ever present danger and to the friendly guise it is likely to assume.
A little candy, a toy, or an apple can suffice to lure a child to his or her doom".
Very true!
Keep reading.
"Anxiety among the general public is heightened by the police's failure to apprehend a suspect.
But the police are faced with the almost impossible task of catching a criminal who left not the slightest clue behind.
Who is the murderer?'
What does he look like?
Where is he hiding?
No one knows him, yet he is among us.
Anybody sitting next to you could be the murderer".
Yes, that's very true.
- Why look at me when you say that?
- You know very well.
What do I know very well?
Think about it.
It'll come to you.
What are you saying?
I saw you follow that little girl from the fourth floor up the stairs.
You're crazy, you dirty swine!
Who's the swine?
Me, or a man who chases little girls?
You bastard! You swine!
Murderer!
Gentlemen!
I'll see you in court!
I'll have you locked up!
Slanderer!
Trying to ruin my reputation!
Damn slanderer!
Besmirching a man's good name!
And the police fall for it!
A search warrant!
How awful! What a disgrace!
Searching a man's house based on an anonymous letter!
Mr. Jäger, please calm down.
We're only doing our job.
As if it weren't enough that we're in constant fear for our kids!
You see? That's why the police must follow up every lead.
Any man on the street could be the murderer.
Can you please tell me what time it is?
Yes, my child.
Now you must hurry home.
Where do you live?
What's it to you where the kid lives?
Excuse me?
What do you want with that kid?
Absolutely nothing!
What do you want with me?
I'll show you what I want!
Let me go!
This is an outrage!
- What's going on?
- This is an outrage!
- What does Four-Eyes want?
- Don't get so excited.
First chatting up children...
- Punch him in the face! then acting like a big shot!
Will you let me go!
I didn't even speak to the child!
- Get her alone, eh?
- And kill her like the others, right?
- He's the murderer!
- Hold him!
Call the police!
- Never around when you need 'em!
- Officer!
Make way, gentlemen.
Let us through.
Sure, you can catch pickpockets!
Why don't you catch the murderer instead!
What? Is he the murderer?
Break it up!
Come on, move along!
- The murderer!
- The monster!
Get him!
Tackle him!
MURDERER WRITES TO THE PRESS
"Because the police did not publish my first letter,
I am writing now directly to the press!
Proceed with your investigations.
All will soon be confirmed.
But I'm not done yet!"
This is a terrible scandal!
Imagine the effect such a note will have on the public, Commissioner!
This is simply irresponsible!
Mr. Secretary, we cannot stop the murderer from writing to whomever he wishes!
This severely pathological man probably takes great pleasure in seeing his crimes covered in the press.
We immediately got in touch with the newspaper and had them send us the original letter.
The lab's working on it right now.
Of course, you can't get good fingerprints from a postcard
that's passed through so many hands.
Nevertheless, we will leave no stone unturned.
We'll painstakingly compare the results against our archives
in hopes of finding something that can be used to solve this case.
Then we'll send the letter to our graphologist.
"The aforementioned diamond-shaped and swelling sweeps, clearly seen in the word 'soon', third line from the bottom..."
You got that?
- Yes.
"...attest to the strongly pathological sexuality of this sex offender.
Period.
The partially disrupted and uneven style of his other letters is, in its interpretation,
a form of acting
which may manifest externally as indolence or even lethargy.
The writing as a whole displays
elusive yet unmistakable signs
of madness".
Yes, of course, Commissioner.
I have no doubt you're doing your job, and your men as well.
But we need results!
Results!
Mr. Secretary, my men haven't gotten
12 hours' sleep in an entire week!
My riot squads don't get a moment's peace.
They report for duty almost more fatigued than when they were dismissed,
because the painstaking nature of their work wears on the nerves,
and 80% - if not 90% - of our leads are false.
The homicide squad doesn't even get time to change clothes.
They're constantly on call, always tense and alert,
ever ready to spring into action,
to follow even the slightest lead,
as it just might be the one that solves the case.
Mr. Secretary, just consider the search of the crime scene.
To give you an example:
In the bushes just behind a picket fence,
a small, white, crumpled paper wrapping was found.
It apparently once contained inexpensive sweets.
In the outermost corner
were found traces of fruit drops
and particles of powdered sugar.
We've tried to trace the origin of this wrapper
in every candy shop and grocery store within a radius of a mile and a half,
but all to no avail.
With each passing day we expand the area searched.
But, of course, after such a long time,
no one remembers anything that could serve as a lead.
Despite all these setbacks,
we're forced to press on in our investigation,
always in uncertainty,
and with little chance of success
in bringing the case even one step closer to its conclusion.
Our men are doing everyth...
What good is all this?
Commissioner,
I'm aware you're not dawdling, but that doesn't change the fact that an unknown killer is terrorizing 4 1/2 million people!
And the police are getting nowhere!
Mr. Secretary, you don't seem to have a clear picture of the enormous obstacles confronting our forces.
Do you realize, for example, regarding the route the child took home, that there are 15 conflicting eyewitness accounts alone?
Let me give you a random example:
"Testimony 1,478 in the Beckmann murder case..."
- You've got no clue.
- More than you, mister!
Gentlemen!
You must at least know the color of the cap the little girl wore whom you say you saw with the stranger!
Of course, Inspector.
It was red!
- It was green!
- Red!
Stop! This is pointless!
Thank you, gentlemen.
- You're welcome!
Next witness.
If you rely on a color-blind man for clues, don't be surprised if you get nowhere!
In their hunt for this unknown killer, the police have tracked down more than 1,500 detailed leads.
The files in this case fill 60 thick volumes.
We've dispatched all our forces
to systematically comb the area adjoining the city.
Every piece of undergrowth is scoured, every thicket searched,
every bush examined,
since any bush or hollow could harbor some object
that could finally set us on the right track.
We called in police dogs.
We set the best trackers on the faintest of traces,
but they lost the scent
and failed to pick it up again despite all efforts.
Since the first murders,
the police have searched homeless shelters night after night,
subjecting everyone in them to thorough scrutiny.
This does not, of course, make the police very popular,
nor does it reduce the general public's anxiety.
Railway stations are kept under surveillance around the clock.
Still, the investigation has not yet yielded the slightest results,
nor have nightly raids in the criminal districts.
The cops!
Get back!
Back!
- This is the police!
Let me go, you dirty bastard!
Let me go, you son of a bitch!
Goddamn bastard!
Put me down!
Let me go!
Let her go, you filthy pig!
Quiet!
Move back!
The top fuzz!
Quiet!
Police orders:
Nobody is to leave this establishment.
Get your papers ready.
Please!
Come now, children, stop this foolishness.
Well, if it isn't Tubby Lohmann!
Quiet!
That'll get you nowhere.
- Go after the murderer instead!
- Right!
Quiet!
Be reasonable now!
Step back!
You hear me? Step back!
Let's go!
Come on, let's see those papers!
- I haven't got any.
- Let's see your papers.
Please let me go, Inspector!
The two guys who tried to escape were caught on the Krangasse.
- Leave those chairs alone!
- Shut up!
Have your papers ready!
Haven't we met before?
- Yeah. So?
Off to the precinct again!
Haven't even made a buck tonight!
Anyone without papers goes down to the precinct!
I tell you, I'm innocent, really!
Stop talking nonsense!
- Let's get moving!
- Kiss my ass!
- Show your papers!
- Where's the paddy wagon?
Don't push.
Everyone will get their turn.
- Silence!
- Cool it, kids!
Have your papers ready!
Your papers.
Inspector, I can't carry my birth certificate around with me everywhere!
- Quit your bellyaching, child.
- I really can't, Inspector!
The precinct for you!
You make me puke!
Shoddy work, my friend.
You've been had.
Precinct.
- See you, Willy. Ta-ta!
Ah, lay off!
Next.
Stuck-up snob.
What's wrong?
- Papa Lohmann...
- ...nabbed him!
UNSOLVED BURGLARY AT FURRIER'S
We'd better take you down to the precinct too.
What do you mean?
My papers are in order.
Move on.
Move on!
Ah, tough luck!
Next.
Papers.
- Don't got none.
To the precinct.
Just my luck.
Next, come on.
You're ruining my business, Sarge.
These raids every night.
No one can get a moment's peace!
They're human beings too.
You think... we stay up all night just for the hell of it?
No.
But you're drivin' away my clientele, and you won't find the guy you're lookin' for here anyway.
If you knew how steamed they are at the guy who's causing these raids.
Especially the girls.
Sure, they solicit.
Business is business.
But believe me, in every one of them beats a mother's heart!
I know a lot of toughs who get all teary-eyed just seein' the little ones at play.
If they ever get their hands on that monster, they'll make toothpicks out of him!
Ready to leave, Sergeant.
So long.
They hit the Crocodile Club today.
Two paddy wagons.
What's keeping Safecracker?
Is it 3:00 yet?
I'll find out.
The exact time, please, miss.
2:58. Thank you.
The cops are crawling the streets like ants again.
Green coats wherever you spit.
They're on your back even if you're with a broad.
They've gone nuts... got this murderer on the brain.
My old lady has a little six-year-old girl, and every night I have to check under the bed to see if the murderer's hiding there.
You can't do business anymore for tripping over cops everywhere.
There's no privacy anymore.
I'm fed up with it.
What else is new?
- Where the heck is Safecracker?
- Think they might have nabbed him?
That guy? Come on.
Scotland Yard laid a trap for him once on a bank job he pulled in London.
There he was, hands up, back to the wall, cops all around him.
Seconds later there were three men dead on the ground, but he wasn't one of 'em!
No one better from Berlin to San Francisco.
They've been after him six years and they've yet to get him.
Not yet. But put enough dogs on the fox's tail...
Can it!
Damn it!
I can't take this!
He was always right on time before.
- Thank God!
- Finally.
Morning!
Are you nuts?
Close those blinds!
Gentlemen,
I hereby open this meeting.
I declare all division leaders of this organization present.
I assume you're authorized to make binding decisions for your divisions.
Good. We'll dispense with the preliminaries, as we all know why we're here.
An outsider is ruining our business and our reputation.
Measures taken by the police and the daily raids to catch this child murderer are hampering our activities to an almost unbearable degree.
We can no longer tolerate the fact that we're not safe now in any hotel, bar, café or even private home from the clutches of the police.
Very true.
This state of affairs must end.
Things must return to normal or we'll go under.
Our coffers will soon be depleted.
If we can't get funds to support the wives of those members who currently enjoy room and board at state expense,
I don't know where we'll find the money to carry out our plans.
Our reputation is suffering as well.
The police seek the murderer in our fold.
Gentlemen, when I run head-on into an officer from the squad, he knows the potential risks, and so do I.
If either dies in the line of duty, fine.
Occupational hazard.
But we must draw a firm line between ourselves and this man they're looking for!
We conduct our business in order to survive, but this monster has no right to survive!
He must be killed, eliminated, exterminated!
Without mercy or compassion!
Gentlemen, our members must be able to go about their business again without frantic cops in their way at every turn.
I invite...
...your views, gentlemen.
Step up ID checks, comb the entire city, and raids... relentless, ever tougher raids!
We need informers!
We must know the police's plans almost before they do themselves!
The girls gotta work the cops more!
How often has one of us been nabbed
'cause his gal ratted on him to the cops?
Now they can rat on the cops!
Every resident, every landlord, every property owner must be forced to consent to meticulous searches of his property for the slightest of clues.
What if we...
We have our connections.
What if we put an article in the papers that our syndicates...
I mean, our organization... doesn't wish to be lumped in together with this pig, and that the cops should look for this guy somewhere else.
He's not even a real crook!
This man may well be... when not engaged in the actual act of killing... a harmless, upstanding citizen who wouldn't hurt a fly.
In his right mind, perhaps he plays marbles with his landlady's kids or plays cards with friends.
Without what I'll call the innocuousness of these murderers' private lives, it's inconceivable that someone like Grossmann or Haarmann could have lived right next door to their neighbors for years without arousing the faintest trace of suspicion!
This is where we must focus the public's attention.
The public must cooperate.
I'll tell you about public cooperation!
Just thinking of it makes me puke.
I beg your pardon, Commissioner.
But ain't it the truth?
What the devil has public cooperation gotten us so far?
Piles of letters full of the most outrageous slander!
Very true.
They alert homicide whenever a chimney sweep walks by.
That's right.
But when you really want reliable information from them, then they suddenly haven't got a clue.
Why, they just can't seem to remember a thing.
There's your public cooperation for you!
I believe you're exaggerating a bit,
Lohmann.
It can't really be that bad, can it?
But it is, Commissioner!
Most of the public still takes the position,
"How does this concern me?"
The idea that each individual is responsible for what happens to the poorest, most anonymous child on the street hasn't even dawned on the public at large!
I've got another idea.
There was this magician.
Te... Tele...
I can't remember what you call it.
Anyway, he could conjure up hidden pennies out of handkerchiefs.
The reward is still far too little money.
The man who leads us to the murderer should get a fortune.
None of this is anything new.
This is all leading nowhere.
So we just wait for the police to catch the guy instead?
The difficulties in solving crimes of this nature are, in my experience, often insurmountable, since perpetrator and victim are often brought together by mere chance.
The instincts of the moment drive the murderer's actions.
The victim is found and identified, his or her last known whereabouts are determined, and then... then comes the big question mark.
These children vanish without a trace.
And when they're found...
Well, we all know the state in which we've found them.
And the perpetrator...
It's a fact well-known to all of us that murderers like this rarely leave a clue behind.
That's what makes our work so hard, our successes so few.
The police have been after this murderer for eight months now.
They'll only get him by accident now.
- We can't wait for that.
No, we'll go broke by then.
What, then?
We have to catch him... ourselves.
Yes, that's what we must do.
There is perhaps one other way.
I'm quite certain that information on the individual in question must already exist somewhere.
Being the severely pathological case that he is, he has no doubt already had some kind of contact with the authorities.
That's why all health care facilities, prisons, clinics and insane asylums must be encouraged to cooperate with us unequivocally.
We specifically need information on those released after being deemed harmless to society but who, due to their inclinations, could be the murderer.
We must cover the city with a net of informers.
Every square mile must be under constant surveillance.
No child in this city must take a single step without us knowing it.
- Fine, but how?
- And who?
It must be people who can go anywhere without causing a stir, follow anyone without attracting attention, follow any child to any house without arousing suspicion.
In short, people whom the killer would never suspect.
- But who?
- There are no such people!
- Who could do that?
- Who?
The beggars.
The organization of beggars!

Black Friday for roast beef.
All right.
Now come the courtyards.
Yes, from number 1 to 88.
Next.
You're responsible for the courtyards on Hauptstrasse from 1 to 88.
Got it.
What's next?
Hauptstrasse, from number 89... to 196.
Hauptstrasse, number 89 to 196.
Member number?
- 3795. Emil Dustermann.
Well, Emil, maybe you'll win the 15,000.
I've got my fingers crossed.
Knock on wood.
My heartfelt thanks, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you.
"In searching homes, be on the lookout for any clue which could establish the origin of the murderer's letter to the Courier.
Be on the lookout as well for an old wooden table..."
Idiot!
"...or red pencil..."
Come in.
"... or writing paper of the type used by the killer".
Inspector, here are reports on mental patients who've been released as cured or deemed harmless over the last five years.
Reports from every private and public institute, as well as from municipal hospitals and asylums.
And here's a list of their present addresses.
Good day.
Does a Mr. Beckert live here?
Pardon me?
Does a Mr. Beckert live here?
I'm afraid I don't understand.
I'm a bit hard of hearing.
You don't say.
Does a Mr. Beckert live here?
Mr. Beckert... yes, he does.
But he just stepped out.
I had hoped to speak with him.
I'm from the tax office.
The tax office. Oh, my Lord!
Perhaps you'd like to wait for him...
Yes, thank you.
- Please have a seat.
- Thank you.
- Perhaps you'd like something to read.
- Thank you. Most kind.
THE GENERAL GAZETTE
Tell me, Mrs. Winkler, does Mr. Beckert subscribe to any newspapers?
Mr. Beckert?
No, he always borrows mine.
I see. Thank you.
Mommy!
I wanted to meet you halfway!
Child, you mustn't do that.
You know why.
Good day.
What would you like?
Coffee.
No, a vermouth.
No, a cognac.
Here you are.
Another.
Check.
Two cognacs... that's 1.65, please.
Thank you very much.
Number 24: Beckert.
Doesn't take the Courier.
Table: polished mahogany, with tablecloth.
No traces of red pencil.
In fact, no writing materials of any kind.
Printed matter found in wastebasket: cigar ad and a postcard with flowers and "Regards, Paul" on it, but no address of sender.
An empty cigarette pack, Ariston brand, a bag of candy...
Just a moment.
Ariston?
What was that?
I'd like the file on the Marga Perl murder case.
Thank you very much.
That's odd.
I've heard that before.
It was...
It was...
Hey, Heinrich!
What is it?
What's wrong?
- Listen. Someone's whistling.
Can't you hear it?
There.
Now he's stopped.
Did you see the guy who was whistling?
Yes, I can still see him.
Heinrich, he's talking to a little girl and walking her down the street.
- After him, quick, and don't lose him!
- Why?
The day little Elsie Beckmann was killed, a man bought a balloon from me.
He was with a little girl... and he whistled just like that!
Damn it, man!
Are you crazy, throwing orange peels on the ground?
A man could slip and break his neck!
Unbelievable!
I should report you to the police!
Outrageous behavior!
Hey, mister.
Aha! Here it is.
"In a 150-foot radius of the crime scene, three cigarette butts of the Ariston brand were found". There you have it.
Yes, it may be the same brand of cigarettes, but there was no old wooden table.
Of course, he could have written that letter somewhere else.
Good God!
The window ledge!
You're right.
Just a minute.
Red pencil.
My God, finally!
We're finally on his trail.
What?
They're on his trail?
- Did they find him?
- The beggars found him.
- His whistling gave him away.
- They put a mark on him.
Shut up!
What did you say?
They're following the mark.
He isn't out of sight for a second.
His every move is being watched.
- Mister.
- What is it?
- You got some white stuff on your coat.
- Where?
On your shoulder.
Here, I'll wipe it off.
- What's the matter?
- Come on. We're leaving.
He didn't come out this way.
We would've seen him.
Out of the question!
- Well, he didn't turn back.
- He has to be somewhere, damn it!
Maybe he's hiding inside the building.
Closing time!
We can't let him get away in the crowd!
If he slips through now...
They're starting to come out!
Out in the street, and keep your eyes peeled!
Excuse me, may I ask you a question?
My trip is tomorrow.
I start in Königsberg...
No, in my condition
I can't eat anything like that...
The boss came to my office today...
Turn off the light.
He'll get suspicious if he comes home and sees it on.
What time is it, anyway?
Almost 6:30.
He's gotta still be inside!
He definitely didn't come out with the office crowd.
No, just a moment.
The beggars have called for backup and surrounded the whole building.
They figure the guy's hiding in the building.
What sort of building is it?
What sort of building is it?
Nothing but offices.
I don't know what's in the basement.
There's a branch of the local savings bank on the ground floor, and the second to sixth floors are nothing but offices.
Above that is the attic space.
This is unbelievable.
Anyone still in there?
Anyone still in here?
What the devil!
Anybody still in here?
Damn carelessness!
All that trouble for one door.
Seems the guy's cornered now.
I think we should tip the cops off right away.
- I agree.
- Let's not waste time!
Stay by the phone and call back in a few minutes.
What is it?
Are you crazy or something?
The police?
No! We're gonna get this guy ourselves!
Listen, the time now is...
All right. 9:00... 10:00...
At 11:00!
Evening. Did you know your gate isn't closed?
What? That's impossible!
Why I just... Wait, it is!
Open up, quick!
And not a sound!
Come on! Move it!
Let's go!
Come on, move it!
How many other watchmen are in the building?
Don't want to answer, eh?
Very well.
There are still two watchmen on their rounds.
Goddamn it!
Damn piece of crap!
Goddamned lock!
Damn it to hell!
Shit!
Careful where you shine those lights!
And don't stomp around like elephants!
He's not in the basement.
We went through it all and found nothing.
Two men are still going through the boiler room.
Hold it!
This is the last one.
Go up and join Emil.
He needs help.
Safecracker sent me.
All right.
Listen carefully.
This is a new type of time clock.
Here's a general diagram.
If they're not set at exactly the right minute, an alarm automatically goes off at the nearest police station. Get it?
You got it?
- I'm not an idiot!
- Well...
He's not in the boiler room or the coal room.
We turned over every piece of coal.
Hey!
Are you nuts?
What if the doors are wired?
You want the police here in five minutes?
We gotta get in if we're gonna search the whole place!
But not through the door, you idiot!
Go through the ceiling of the office above!
Nothing.
All right. Down we go.
Hey, what's up?
Hey! What is it?
Wait a minute!
Answer me, damn it!
What's going on?
- I heard some banging!
- Where are you off to?
- Why are you running?
Wait, damn it!
I've gotta see Safecracker!
He's in the attic, I tell you!
I heard him knocking!
Quiet!
Go on! He has to be in there!
Here's the light switch.
Force the locks.
Come on. Hurry up!
Got him! I found the guy!
He's in the attic!
I heard someone banging, and I told Safecracker.
He's up there with eight men.
They'll get him any moment now.
Just came down to fill you in.
If I hadn't been alert, we could've looked for him for hours!
The watchman!
Three... one... four.
- Everybody out!
- What?
- The cops'll be here in five minutes.
- Damn it! Who called 'em?
- The watchman rang the alarm.
- Let's scram!
Hold it!
Quiet down!
Five more minutes, six more storage sheds.
Move it! Get going!
Not like that!
Out of the way!
- He's not in here.
- Next door!
Come on! Faster!
- He's not here either.
- Move on! Next door!
Quickly! We've only got three minutes left!
No padlock on this one... he must be here!
Open it!
- Something's jammed inside.
- Let me do it!
Hurry! Only one minute left!
There he is, the dog!
Come on! Move it!
Everybody out!
Get out while you can, damn it!
Move it!
For Christ's sake, get going!
What's keeping the others?
- They're coming!
If not, they might as well stay here, with or without the guy!
What in the hell is keeping them?
Finally! Thank God!
Quick now! Go!
Make it snappy!
He's not down here.
Hey! Who pulled up the rope?
Hey, who pulled up the rope?
Bunch of morons!
Hello there.
Hands up!
How can I put my hands up when I'm holding on to the rope?
Come out of there!
I'm really innocent this time...
...like a newborn babe.
This may surprise you, Franz... but I believe you.
Then everything's in order, and I can go now, right?
Just a moment.
Cigarette?
Uh-oh.
I'll take your word for it, Franz... provided... you can tell me... who the man was that you were looking for and that you found in that building.
I don't understand, Inspector.
A man, you say?
I know nothing about that.
There must be some mistake.
I know nothing.
Nothing at all.
Of course.
There's just one thing I don't get: why you're covering up for the gang who left you in the lurch.
Fine friends, running off when things heat up, leaving you right in the fire.
Phooey!
That ploy won't work with me,
Inspector.
Listen...
What can happen to me anyway?
Maybe a little property damage... so what?
Nothing was pinched!
But something was pinched, my friend!
In fact, a good deal.
What? Something got pinched?
How much?
Tell me what you know and I'll do the same.
I already told you.
I know nothing.
Very well.
Give it some thought, Franz.
Leave a man alone for a couple hours... and a lot comes back to him that he couldn't remember before.
Take him away.
Send the night watchman in.
Mr. Damowatz.
Please sit down.
Now then, you said in your statement...
Listen carefully, in case you have to testify under oath later.
You clearly heard one of the burglars say to the guy guarding you,
"We got him. I found the guy.
He's in the attic".
Is that correct?
- Yes, Inspector.
Yes, I'll swear to that anytime.
Good.
Go home now and recover from your ordeal.
But please remain available for further questioning.
Of course, Inspector.
Good morning, Inspector.
Morning.
Tell me, is Inspector Lohmann in the building?
He's talking to someone?
No, it doesn't matter.
I'll come over myself.
What? I see.
Hasn't come home yet, eh?
Did you keep an eye on the old Winkler woman too?
Come in.
Come in!
- Am I disturbing you?
- No, come in.
Listen, the whole block is surrounded.
If he decides to go home, he has to run into us.
So just keep on waiting.
If anything happens,
I'll be here at the precinct.
Damn it!
What do you want?
I wanted... to ask a favor of you.
Dishwater again!
I wanted to ask you...
Read this first.
- A statement?
- Yeah.
An office building was broken into.
Bennostrasse?
That's a respectable part of town.
Perhaps not that respectable after all.
Hell, this is getting serious!
What the... Did they mean to empty the whole joint?
What could they have been looking for in the coal?
Incredible! Unbelievable!
I'll be damned!
This is madness!
Ah, so they were after the savings bank!
Good God!
What could this mean?
I don't understand at all.
They didn't even touch it?
Must've been a bunch of real idiots!
I'll be damned!
Isn't that something?
Nothing stolen, but a man was carried off.
God knows where they took him.
That's just great.
And Franz isn't talking.
He's afraid, of course.
I know him well. Guy like him would rather jump out the fifth-floor window than be mixed up in a murder rap.
What if we could get at him from that angle?
Lohmann, if you'd be willing to help me out...
Very clever.
I see the wheels turning.
Let's send for this Franz.
You're wanted for questioning.
What? They sent four guys for me?
What's this about?
- Move it!
"Homicide squad.
Inspector Karl Lohmann".
What do you want with me?
What have I got to do with the homicide squad?
Yes, young man... your case has been turned over to me.
But why?
Why?
You boys did your work a little too well.
One of the watchmen...
Dead?
Accessory to murder.
Nasty business.
Inspector, I've had enough!
I want no part of this!
I'll tell you everything I know!
Very sensible, but, unfortunately, too late.
It can't be too late!
It can't be!
I'll tell you everything!
Even what we were looking for in that damn building.
Well...
The child murderer!
What?
Who?
The child murderer, Inspector.
Just a moment.
This had to happen to me!
Me, of all people.
Come sit down, my boy.
We're gonna level with each other, got it?
Certainly, Inspector.
And God help you if you pull something.
Now then... what have you boys got to do with the murderer, and where was the guy taken?
Well, Inspector... you know the old
Kuntz & Levy distillery?
The one that went belly-up in the Depression?
That's the one.
Since then, the building's stood empty, and no one gives a damn about it.
Get out here! Move it!
Let me go!
What have I done to you?
You swine!
Let go of me!
Bastards!
Swine!
What do you want from me?
What do you want...
Help!
Help! Let me out of here!
I want out!
Let me out of here!
You'll never get out of here.
Gentlemen, I beg of you!
I don't even know what you want with me.
I beg you, let me go.
This whole thing must be a mistake!
A mis...
No.
No mistake.
Out of the question.
This is no mistake.
No.
No mistake.
You recognize this?
You bought a balloon just like this for little Elsie Beckmann.
Just like this one.
No!
Where did you bury little Marga Perl, you bastard?
But I never...
I never even met her!
You never even met her!
I suppose you never met her either, huh?
Or her?
You never met her either, huh?
- Stop him!
- Grab him!
- Stop him!
- Don't let him escape!
Watch out! The door!
- Let me out!
- Punch him in the face!
Let go of me!
- You have no right to treat me this way!
- We'll show you we do!
You have no right to hold me here!
Right? There's only one thing right for a man like you... death!
- Right! Kill him!
- Kill the rabid dog!
- Ice him!
- Let him have it!
Quiet!
Kill him!
You spoke of "right" just now.
We will be your right.
Everyone sitting here is an expert in the rule of law!
From six weeks in Tegel prison... to 15 years in Brandenburg.
They'll make sure you get your rights.
You'll even have defense counsel.
Everything according to the letter of the law.
Defense counsel?
I need no defense counsel!
Who's gonna prosecute me?
You, perhaps?
Hey, you.
If I were you,
I wouldn't make big speeches.
Your head's at stake here, in case you hadn't noticed.
And just who are you?
I have the dubious pleasure of serving as your defense.
Though I'm afraid it won't do you much good.
Do you all want to kill me?
You want to just wipe me out?
We simply want to put you out of commission.
And we'll only be sure of that when you're dead.
But you can't murder me just like that!
I demand to be handed over to the police!
I demand to be brought before a real court of law!
That's a good one!
- You'd like that, wouldn't you?
- Look who's talking!
So you can plead insanity and spend the rest of your life being cared for by the state.
And then you break out of the asylum or receive a pardon, and you're happy as can be, free to kill with impunity, protected by law on grounds of insanity... and you're back to chasing little children!
No, no more of that!
You must be taken out of action!
You must go!
But I can't help it!
I can't...
I really can't... help it!
We know that one!
Before the judge, we all "can't help it".
What would you know?
What are you talking about?
Who are you anyway?
Who are you?
All of you.
Criminals.
Probably proud of it, too... proud you can crack a safe or sneak into houses or cheat at cards.
All of which it seems to me you could just as easily give up if you had learned something useful, or if you had jobs or if you weren't such lazy pigs.
But me?
Can I do anything about it?
Don't I have this cursed thing inside me?
This fire, this voice, this agony?
So you mean to say...
you have to kill?
I have to roam the streets endlessly, always sensing that someone's following me.
It's me!
I'm shadowing myself!
Silently... but I still hear it!
Yes, sometimes I feel like I'm tracking myself down.
I want to run... run away from myself!
But I can't!
I can't escape from myself!
I must take the path that it's driving me down and run and run down endless streets!
I want off!
And with me run the ghosts of the mothers and children.
They never go away.
They're always there!
Always!
Always!
Except... when I'm doing it... when I...
Then I don't remember a thing.
Then I'm standing before a poster, reading what I've done.
I read and read...
I did that?
I don't remember a thing!
But who will believe me?
Who knows what it's like inside me?
How it screams and cries out inside me when I have to do it!
Don't want to! Must!
Don't want to! Must!
And then a voice cries out, and I can't listen anymore!
Help! I can't!
I can't!
The accused has stated that he can't help himself.
In other words, he must commit murder.
With that he has pronounced his own death sentence.
Right!
A man who claims that he's compelled to destroy the lives of others... such a man must be extinguished like a bonfire!
Such a man must be obliterated!
Wiped out!
May I address the court?
Counsel for the defense has the floor.
My learned colleague who just spoke... who is, if I'm not mistaken, wanted by the police on three counts of manslaughter...
That's irrelevant here. has claimed that the fact that my client was acting compulsively warrants the death sentence.
That's right!
He is mistaken, because the very nature of compulsion warrants an acquittal!
Get outta here, will ya?
Are you nuts, or plastered?
It is precisely the nature of compulsion that relieves him of responsibility for his actions!
And a man cannot be punished for that for which he is not responsible!
- Ridiculous!
- You mean this monster should go free?
That he should live?
I'm saying that this man is sick, and you turn a sick man over to a doctor, not an executioner.
- Will you guarantee his cure?
- What does the state build asylums for?
- What if he breaks out?
- Or he's declared cured and released?
And one fine day the killing starts all over?
Another month-long manhunt!
Once again the insanity clause, once again the asylum!
Another breakout or possible release!
And again... "must kill"!
Is this supposed to go on indefinitely?
No one has the right to kill a man who cannot be held responsible for his crimes!
Not even the state, and all of you least of all!
The state must ensure that this man is rendered harmless so that he ceases to be a danger to society!
You never had kids, did ya?
Then you never lost any either.
But if you wanna know what it's like when a little child is taken from you, just ask the parents whose kids he took away!
Ask 'em about the days and nights not knowing what had happened, and later, when they finally found out...
Why don't you ask the mothers?
You should ask the mothers!
Think you'd get mercy from any of them for murdering their kids?
- The woman's right!
- Absolutely!
No mercy for the killer!
- Let him have it!
- Slaughter the bastard!
- Kill the monster!
- Kill him!
- Put the animal to death!
- Rub him out!
- Kill him!
- Waste him!
- Get rid of him!
- Annihilate the monster!
I will not let you shout me down!
I will not allow a murder to be committed in my presence.
I demand that this human being...
That's not a human being! that this human being be afforded the same protection under the law rendered the common criminal!
Not a chance!
I demand that he be handed over to the police!
The police!
Of all the dumb...
In the name of the law...
In the name of the people...
This will not bring our children back.
One has to... keep closer watch... over the children!
All of you!
"Now, in Injia's sunny clime,
Where I used to spend my time
"A-servin' of 'Er Majesty, the Queen
"Of all them black-faced crew
"The finest man I knew
"Was our regimental bhisti "
Detail, halt!
What was that all about?
They are pilgrims, sahib, going home to the hills.
They beg to follow us for safety.
Tell them not to fall too far behind.
Detail, walk. March!
Jadoo, the sun is going down.
Expect we'd better bivouac at Elephant Rock, as usual.
Yes, Markham sahib.
I don't like it, Mitchell.
I don't like it. Silence is unhealthy.
No word from Markham in 48 hours.
Blast it, an officer and his patrol don't vanish into thin air.
- Telegraph just got through, sir.
- Good.
What have you got?
Wires apparently down for the last two days.
I thought it was something like that.
Emergency signal, sir.
Why doesn't he go on?
Wire's gone dead, sir.
I don't like this.
Can't have the wires down.
Things start too quickly up there.
Higginbotham.
Find Sgts. MacChesney, Cutter, and Ballantine, and bring them here.
That's a bit difficult, as they're all on leave.
On some mysterious mission, they said.
It'll be a mystery if they come back right side up.
Bring them here at once.
- What do you want?
- Where's Sgt. Ballantine?
- Here.
- Where's Sgt. Cutter?
He's busy.
Buying a map for a buried treasure.
You ought to have your head examined.
- I didn't know the map was a swindle.
- You and your emeralds.
You ought to be put in a padded cell.
If we'd found them emeralds, we could've left the army... and lived like dukes. See?
That's the fellow that sold me the map.
Just a minute.
Let me take care of him, will you?
Take your hands off that man.
I'm waiting for an explanation.
Speak up, MacChesney.
Speak up!
We were swindled, sir.
- We?
- Who swindled you?
We don't want to make any charges until we have further proof.
Further proof?
You practically wrecked a village.
You surely didn't do that,
MacChesney, without proof?
Sir, we had our suspicions.
Suspicions of what?
Come on. I've no time to wheedle the story out of you.
We bought a map.
Go on.
From a private in a certain Scottish regiment, sir.
No, I did it. I bought the map myself, sir.
Now, listen. Don't you try to shield your friends, Cutter.
And it won't do you two any good to hide behind Cutter's generosity.
Out with it. A map of what?
Of Lake Singali, sir.
Yes, sir. And the privilege of diving into it to our heart's content.
Diving for what?
- For emeralds, sir.
- A barge full, sir.
According to the information I bought, it was sunk in the year 241.
I can hardly believe it.
Ballantine, a man of your intelligence...
MacChesney, at your age...
They was the spoils of a maharajah, sir.
Thank you, Cutter. That will be sufficient.
As for you two...
I ought to take away your stripes, not only for insubordination... but for idiocy.
Sheer, childish, soft-brained idiocy.
But fortunately for you,
I need all three of you at Tantrapur.
We're going out on a job, sir?
Of the most vital importance.
You leave for Tantrapur... with a detachment in the morning... to repair the telegraph and keep it open.
Left turn! Left wheel, quick march!
Left wheel! Attention!
Eyes forward!
Party, halt!
Sergeants, dismount!
Cold.
Stale.
I don't mind saying the whole thing fair gives me the creeps.
Creeps or no creeps, we've got to get in touch with the Colonel.
We can't until we get them poles up and this wire strung.
Naik, detail 10 men for guard duty.
The remainder will pile arms and prepare for work.
Halt!
Gunga Din, water.
Gunga Din, bring water!
Bring water!
Whoever's been playing tricks with this village is blinking clever.
I couldn't find a trail or a single footprint leading in or out.
So the village isn't quite deserted, eh?
- Salaam, sahib.
- Who are you? What are you doing?
My name is Pandu Lal.
I'm a miserable seller of trinkets.
Last night a band of dacoits raided this village, looted my shop... and stole off with my poor wife and six children.
The children are looking bonny.
Come on, everybody, in the other room.
Go on, get up. On the double.
Get in there. You heard me!
Quick! That's right. Go on.
That's better.
- What's that?
- Trinkets, sahib.
Only what I could save from my pitiful stock.
- Worth hardly a few annas.
- Go on, open them up.
Who are these playful subjects here?
I don't know, but young Toad Face there seems to be leader.
Get them all out of here.
Come on, get out of here. On your feet.
Hold them there.
Naik, detail eight men for escort duty.
Bring them here on the double.
Listen, you.
What became of Burgess sahib?
- Come on, spit it out.
- He can speak, but he won't.
- He doesn't know.
- Here.
You never saw one of these things before, did you?
It's for growing daisies, isn't it?
- Or for planting lilies for people's graves.
- No, sahib.
What became of these people here?
- He doesn't know.
- That's good.
We'll take them back with us and let the Colonel put them through the mangle.
No. Will not go with the white sahib.
You will never leave here.
Already your graves are dug.
By nightfall, Ma Kali will be smiling.
Never mind the second chorus. Come on.
Party, form a square!
Under cover, everybody! Get in there!
Take cover in the courtyard.
Close the gates.
Climb the wall, everybody!
Come on, men, on the roof!
Look out, Mac!
Take cover behind the wall.
Volley firing. Ready?
Ready? Get set. Fire!
Here you are, Cutter.
Get in there. Come on.
Ballantine, come up!
Let's go.
Here's a present for you.
Bal, catch!
Come on, let's go!
Charge!
Everybody under cover!
Get behind the wall. Come on. Hurry up.
- Panee, Sergeant sahib?
- No!
How did you get here?
You're a funny bloke, Din... but I'll admit you're a good bhisti.
- Could be first-class soldier, sahib.
- Don't make me laugh.
Get to the river!
- Come on, you savage, over you go.
- Over you go.
All right, give me that.
What's the matter, Bal?
You've been woolgathering ever since we crawled out of the river.
- You know, my time is up on May 14.
- What of that?
You can sign on for another nine years, can't you?
Make a man out of him.
I'm leaving the service.
- Leaving the service?
- That's right.
I'm getting married, and I'm going in the tea business.
- Married!
- Tea business!
Why, you're mad if...
March to attention, everybody!
Let's march in in good style, men.
- Fall in up there.
- Left, right, left.
Tell the Sergeant to report at the office immediately.
Yes, sir.
Party, right wheel!
Halt! Left face!
Sergeants to the front!
The wiring party's returned from Tantrapur, sir.
Eight killed, three wounded.
Otherwise all correct.
Very well, Sergeant. Dismiss your men... and report at the office immediately.
Very good, sir.
Party, dismissed!
- Identical, Mitchell.
- Good heavens, a Thug pickaxe.
It's incredible, but that's what happened to Markham.
I'm afraid they've done away with poor Burgess, too.
There's been none of this for 50 years.
Thuggee. That's what it is, Mitchell.
What's Thuggee, sir?
A murder cult Col. Sleeman crushed
50 years ago.
The Thugs were the most fiendish band of killers that ever existed.
There were at least 10,000 in India, and they murdered 30,000 people a year.
Thuggee was practiced from the Himalayas to Ceylon.
The order was religious and worshipped
Kali, the goddess of blood.
The Thugs were stranglers, weren't they, sir?
Stranglers. They dug the graves of their victims in advance.
Mitchell, we must stamp this out immediately.
The Lancers will scour the country west of Tantrapur...
- you will search the regions to the east.
- Right.
- What do we do, sir?
- You're dismissed, Ballantine.
MacChesney, you and Cutter will leave tomorrow with a stronger...
Ballantine, you're dismissed.
You and Cutter will take a stronger detachment tomorrow... into Tantrapur, to finish your work.
Maj. Mitchell and I will be in close touch with you at all times on either flank.
Keep your eyes open for Thugs.
Ballantine would be a great help, sir.
If I may remind you... the three of us have always brought off things very well together.
Yes, sir. He's indispensable.
Ballantine's leaving the service in six days.
He's getting married.
Couldn't you put your foot down?
Forbid the banns? Something like that?
When the parson says, "Speak now or forever hold your peace"... couldn't you give him a roar, sir?
You know what I mean?
Higginbotham will replace him.
Dismissed.
- Tommy, I've got you back again.
- And I've got you.
I'm here to stay, forever and ever.
Forever and ever.
That's horrible.
- She's charmed him like a snake.
- The siren.
Wouldn't believe it if I didn't see it with my own eyes.
Me, neither.
I can't stand it.
Me, too.
Left! Right! Center!
As you were!
Company, attention!
Right turn!
Two paces forward. March!
Head up, chin in.
Get those thumbs behind the seams of your trousers...
Get them back.
Lower that left shoulder an eighth of an inch. That's much better.
Otherwise you're looking very regimental, Din.
Thank you, Sergeant.
- Was salute satisfactory?
- That's the idea... only you want these fingers to fan the eyebrows, more like this.
The breeze from them fingers ought to almost blow this eyebrow off.
Now try it again.
Very good, indeed.
That one almost blew your turban off, didn't it?
Very regimental, Din.
Keep them at it, Subedar sahib.
They may need it.
Tell the Subedar to drill the men till sundown.
- Where did you get the bugle, Din?
- Please, sahib, I find when nobody looking.
Don't you know that's very naughty?
Please, sahib, don't take away.
Bugle only pleasure for poor bhisti.
Thank you, sahib.
- Sahib care to hear new call?
- Not now.
Very regimental, Din.
Company, attention! Company, dismissed!
Let me see your tongue, Annie.
I'd like to try it, Sergeant sahib.
Very old Indian remedy.
All right, go ahead. But be careful.
If anything happens to her, I'II...
Understand? Cry my eyes out.
No, sahib!
Very little bit goes very long way.
Gulp it down quick.
Then you won't taste it.
I know. You want your daddy to give it to you, don't you?
Daddy will give you the medicine.
Give it to me.
There. Be a nice girl, now.
Or you'll never be strong and big like Daddy.
If Daddy took a spoonful first himself,
Baby might do a patty-cake for him.
This is delicious.
This is...
All for a nice little elephant girl.
This is lovely.
You ain't so stupid as you look.
That's better.
Annie, don't ever worry me like that again.
There you are, you two.
I've got letters for both of you.
There. Sgt. MacChesney and Sgt. Archibald Cutter.
Look what it says here.
"Miss Emaline Stebbins requests the pleasure...
"of Sgt. Archibald Cutter's company at a"...
What's that?
"...betrothal dance preceding her marriage to Sgt. Thomas Ballantine.
"8:00 p.m. Friday." That's tonight.
I worried so about you, dear, while you were away.
Perfectly awful things must have happened at Tantrapur.
It was rather touch and go there for a bit.
- You haven't told me yet about it yourself.
- No, I haven't, have I?
I had to give my undivided attention to the repairing of the wires.
Cutter and MacChesney should have watched out for the enemy... but they were off chasing butterflies or something like that.
I finally got the detachment to the river, and we dived in and escaped.
Tommy, you're so marvelous.
That's all there is to it, I suppose.
On the last roof we almost lost MacChesney.
His great elephant hoof crashed through and stuck.
- How did you get him out?
- We had to saw his leg off at the hip.
If you don't believe me, just look behind that shrub.
Save some for the elephant.
Destroy the evidence.
- Stand guard, will you?
- Yeah.
Never mind that, Sergeant. Stand easy.
- Good evening, Colonel.
- Evening, Stebbins.
- Good evening, Major.
- How are you?
No formality.
We just dropped in to wish little Emmy the best of luck.
That's very nice of you, sir.
I'll bring Emmy to you.
- Looks like a jolly party, Sergeant.
- Yes, sir. Very jolly, sir.
Is that a punch bowl you're shutting out?
Is that punch?
Some peoples calls it a punch, sir, but I calls it swill.
Nonsense. Stebbins is famous for his punch. Have a spot?
Rather.
Excuse me, sir.
I wouldn't touch it if I were you, sir.
Too watery, sir. Besides, it'll rust in the lining of your stomach.
- We'll be the judge of that.
- Wait, sir. There's a fly.
- I don't see a fly.
- Neither do I.
There it is, sir. It just dove under the ice.
I'll get the little nipper in half a jiffy.
I got him.
Hear him? Humming like a beehive.
He's gone.
Ain't that a shame? There he goes.
Come along, Mitchell.
I think we'll forget the punch.
Tommy, you know we have
Sgt. Higginbotham to thank... for your being let out of the expedition.
That's right.
The Colonel says I'm the only man sharp enough...
- to replace Sgt. Ballantine.
- That's very flattering.
I'm only glad to be so some help in, shall we say, Cupid's service.
One thing I can promise... with Cutter and MacChesney about, you won't have one dull moment.
I've got a feeling they don't like me very much. It's just as well.
- The army's no place for sentiment, I says.
- That's right.
Excuse me.
I've got a pebble in my left boot.
Hello, Higginbotham.
- How would you like to come with me?
- What?
I'd like to discuss a few of my military theories with you.
I'd like to have a little chat, get to know each other better.
- How about a bit of a drink, Bert?
- Thanks, Cutter.
- Where's Ballantine?
- Never mind that civilian.
I got Bertie Higginbotham, his replacement.
Bertie's got a thirst like a derby winner, haven't you, Bertie?
We can look after that, old boy.
Take a plunge into this punch.
Punch? That stuff's for drummer boys and old ladies.
- Not that stuff.
- That would knock a horse down.
Swill that down, me boy... and you'll think all the Thugs in India is a bunch of missionaries.
That's right, Bert.
That's a funny thing.
The punch tastes all right.
It's all right.
Bert, how about having another drink?
To the new comradeship, Mac and you and me and the regiment forever.
- That's it, Bertie, my boy.
- I'll drink to that.
All right.
Here's to good old Bertie Higginbotham... the finest soldier since
William the blooming Conqueror.
Down the hatch, boys!
Which of these two do you prefer?
I don't know. Try them both.
One for each window.
Don't be silly, darling.
It's as much your problem as it is mine.
- I know.
- These curtains are for your den.
My den?
What's this, Sergeant?
Buying a trousseau?
We're buying curtains.
I thought it was for underpants, the kind civilians wear in the tea business.
Will you two leave and stop annoying Tommy?
I'd like to oblige, but we're marching off to Tantrapur in 20 minutes... and Tommy's marching with us.
But Higginbotham's replacing him.
The Colonel said...
Higginbotham's in hospital, Miss.
I grieve to say, Miss, that the man is a tower of pain.
- Something he must have ate.
- Or drank?
Sgt. Ballantine, fall in!
- Tommy.
- It's the Colonel's orders, Miss.
Tommy, these friends of yours have engineered this behind your back.
Don't cry, darling.
Goodbye.
This is May 9.
I'm going with you for five days, and good company I'll be... but at sunset on May 14, when my time is up... wherever we are, I'm going to knock you two apes' heads together.
Now come on.
- Pardon me, madam.
- Fall in!
Your petticoat's showing.
Ek Number! All's well!
Do Number!
All's well!
Teen Number! All's well!
Chaar Number! All's well!
Paanch Number! All's well!
Swing those picks there.
You think this is a strawberry festival?
Shake a leg with that pole.
Come on, get it up there at the double.
This is a fine time for things to go quiet.
Blast them Thugs.
Why don't they come and give us a good fight?
Then Bal will be a pipe to re-enlist.
Come on, hurry up, I told you.
How can we get a nice little war going?
What if I were to blow up the Taj Mahal or one of them sacred tombs?
What do you want to do, start the Indian Mutiny again?
Annie, get your back into it! Hurry up!
He's even snarling at poor little Annie.
You can't work 24 hours a day, you know.
In another 24 hours, my time will be up.
I don't want to leave anything undone that might detain me.
Get it up, hurry up.
He's tired.
It just goes to show you what a piece of dry goods will do.
A brilliant bloke like him, too.
Cutter, we got to do something.
Come here.
- What now?
- Look, Mac... for four days we've been waiting for them Thugs to start something.
Four days in this cruel heat and horrible tension.
- What's that to do with Ballantine?
- I'm coming to that.
Go on.
Three hours from where we're sitting, by a secret trail... there's a gold temple waiting to be sliced away and carried off.
Have you started after this buried treasure again?
Just a minute, Mac. This one ain't buried.
According to Gunga Din, it's standing right out in the open.
According to Gunga Din, eh?
I thought he might have been at the bottom of this.
What's the idea of this lushing?
- Give me that bottle.
- Wait!
Just a minute.
MacChesney, I'm here to speak, and I'm going to have my say.
You want Ballantine to stay with us, don't you?
- Of course I want him to stay.
- All right. Just a minute.
It's as easy as parting your hair.
We take Bal to the temple, show him the gold... and the moment he starts slicing at it... marriage and the tea business will whiz from his mind.
MacChesney, versus that, you can't think of a single argument.
Cutter, I'm warning you.
- What's the matter with you?
- What's the matter with me?
I'm sick of it! Now shut your trap.
- You mean you won't go?
- No!
And if you mention gold temples again to me...
I'll tear the back right off you with a shovel.
Very well, MacChesney, you made your choice.
I offered you the chance to be a millionaire... and you turned it down.
All right, I'm going alone.
Wait a minute!
Cutter, you ain't leaving this village without my permission.
Give me that bottle.
I've been a soldier for 14 years.
I know my duties as well as you do.
But you're not talking to a soldier now, you're talking to an expedition.
I'm an expedition. Out of my way.
Cutter, sit down before I throw you down.
Make way for the expedition, if you know what's good for you.
Goodbye forever.
Stand back.
I'll throw you in the clink if you make a move.
Out of my way before I split your jaw.
- Cutter, I'm warning you.
- Come on, put 'em up.
Come on, out of my way.
I'll bash your ugly face in, that's what I'll do.
Come on, put 'em up.
I'm afraid I have to do it.
Sgt. Ballantine.
- What?
- Come here.
Poor fellow's taken with a dizzy spell.
Lock him up safely until he comes to.
I'll lock him up. I'm only sorry you didn't have a dizzy spell, too.
Then I'd lock you both up at the same time.
Good old Din. What's up?
Tonight, when everyone sleep,
Din go back again.
- See gold.
- You did?
Where is it?
Didn't you bring any with you?
Bhisti cannot carry whole temple.
- Whole temple?
- Din see it. All gold.
Here, now.
We've got to get out of here now.
Get me some tools that I can rip these blinking bars out with.
- Already bring all tools could find.
- Yeah.
Is this satisfactory, sahib?
Think I want to break out of a blooming pudding?
Go on, get something big. Jaldi!
Up, Annie. Please, Annie.
What are you doing, Din?
A large tool you asked for, sahib.
Annie, come on, pull these blinking bars out for me.
Work for me. Get me out of here, Annie.
Come on, Annie. Be a good girl.
Whoa, Annie! Just the bars!
Alert the guards!
- Wake up!
- What?
The Thugs are here!
Why didn't you say so?
I'd like to get a crack at them.
What happened?
- Dacoits slipped in and stole elephant.
- What's that?
Thugs stole Annie.
Stole Annie? They'll stoop to anything.
How many were there?
- Couldn't see.
- Where did they go?
- The hills.
- Sound assembly.
Sgt. Ballantine, pick 16 men and follow me.
MacCheesecake, if this is another of your tricks...
Fall in the remainder!
Put every man on guard duty!
- Very good, sir.
- Steal Annie, will they?
I'll break every Thug's back in India!
Din, are you sure you're on the right trail?
Yes, sahib. Here is the bridge, sahib.
- Is this bridge safe?
- It's safe, sahib.
Safe? What do you mean, safe?
Make her stop that.
She's making me nervous.
Get out of my way.
It's no time to do a thing like that!
Annie! Take your foot off.
Annie! Take your trunk off.
Annie, please go back!
That's gold, bugler.
Look at it, bugler.
That's yours and mine.
Archibald Cutter, the blooming duke, look at me, and Rajah Gunga Din... pouring diamonds out of that there blinking water bag.
Bugle will be very satisfactory.
Come on, Din. The world is ours.
Kali. Sahib, come quick.
Thugs, lift up your faces... to the light that shines from Kali's throne.
Brothers in Thuggee... we are the friendless of this earth.
Every man's hand is against us.
We have been kicked, spat upon... and driven to the hills like wild things.
My father was a Thug, and he was hanged.
His father was blown from a cannon's mouth.
And what of your kinsmen, your fathers and their fathers... and their fathers' fathers before them?
My brothers, a new day is at hand.
I have read the omens, and they are good.
Three nights ago, a jackal screamed upon the left.
Another answered from the right at once.
What does that mean, my brothers?
It means that Mother Kali, with all her arms outstretched... hugs us to her bosom, welcoming us back as Thugs...
Thugs awakened from a sleep... of 50 years.
Let the neophytes and their teachers draw near.
Where are the stranglers?
Give them their strangling cloths.
Give them their burial picks.
Swear by our Mother Kali... to be thrice faithful to her and to me and to our order... and to all of us.
Rise, our new-made brothers.
Rise and kill.
Kill, lest you be killed yourselves.
Kill for the love of killing.
Kill for the love of Kali. Kill!
It's them all right, Din, the whole blinking lot of them.
Very bad men.
The Colonel's got to know.
You must get there, Din.
The Colonel's got to know.
The Colonel? I run quick.
Since mighty roast beef
is an Englishman's food
It accounts for the freedom
that runs in his blood
For generous living
Does it do all good
Excuse me, mates.
Oh, the roast beef of England
And, oh, the old English roast beef
Sing us a song, will you?
You're all under arrest.
The whole bunch of you.
And you, too. You know why?
Her Majesty's very touchy about having her subjects strangled.
I can't waste any more time.
Come on, wrap up your gear.
You're coming with me. Hurry up.
Guruji.
If it ain't young Toad Face.
Fancy meeting you here.
Vile dog.
For that insolence, you shall grovel before my son.
You shall grovel, I say!
Look here.
I'm a soldier of Her Majesty the Queen, and I don't grovel before any heathen.
Kabul, take him to the tower... and teach him the error of false pride.
Take him away!
In those drear gray hours before dawn, just go out and chase elephants.
Beats counting sheep a million miles.
What do you mean, elephants?
This ain't elephants.
This is Annie, my Annie.
I'll find her if I have to turn out the whole British Army.
What the blazes is this?
Good morning, gentlemen.
Good morning.
What the blazes are you here for?
I've come to replace Sgt. Ballantine.
Higginbotham,
I could just fall on your neck.
I got a better neck than mine you can fall on.
That's a good one. Hello, there!
Tommy, hello!
How wonderful of you to meet us.
I came here to surprise you, and here you are, surprising me.
- Good morning, Sgt. MacChesney.
- Good morning, Miss.
Here are Tommy's discharge papers.
Cutter will be very pleased about this.
- Column of threes!
- Eyes front!
Sit up straight there!
Who do you think you are, a lot of blinking nursemaids in Hyde Park?
Walk march!
Forward!
Party, halt!
Sgt. Ballantine, take charge.
Go inside, dear. I'll be right with you.
All right, but do hurry, so we can leave soon.
- Naik, what about this?
- He just came back, Sergeant sahib.
Come here, you.
Din, I knew you was at the bottom of all this.
Didn't you knock down the shed and take off Sgt. Cutter?
You'll answer to me.
We'll have a court-martial here and now.
- Line up a firing squad.
- Please, sahib.
You stole the elephant, didn't you?
Answer me!
You knocked down a building and liberated Her Majesty's prisoner...
Sgt. Cutter, didn't you?
- Yes, sahib.
- That's all! Take him away!
You Lazarushian beggar, it'll be the firing squad for you this time!
Wait a minute, Mac. Where's Cutter?
Din, where is Sgt. Cutter?
- They catch him.
- What's that? Who?
In the gold temple, they catch Sgt. Cutter.
Who's they? Priests or what?
Very bad men. They'll give him torture.
Go help, quick.
- How many men?
- Don't know.
- I run away quick to bring help.
- I'll bet you ran away quick.
And you'll run back just as quick, too.
Show me the way.
- I'll pick a dozen men.
- You'll pick nothing! I'm going alone.
You haven't a chance.
I'm not killing Cutter by riding in with a troop.
They'll cut him up if we have a rescue party.
- Right. We'll go together.
- No.
Tommy, what's the matter?
Cutter got himself into a mess, and Mac and I are going to get him out.
Don't worry, I'm not taking him.
I'm going as a sergeant in Her Majesty's service.
- I'm not taking any civilians with me.
- Who's a civilian?
It says here,
"Thomas Anthony Ballantine...
"is restored to the rank of citizen of Great Britain...
"and his duty to Her Majesty's service is over and done with."
Try and keep me out of this.
I'm saying goodbye, Bal, and I wish you luck in the tea business... and your matrimony both.
Wait a minute, Mac.
Wait right here. I have to talk to him.
- But he said you can't go.
- He'll change his mind.
- I won't let you go!
- Darling, I have to go. I owe it to Cutter.
- He's saved my life time and again.
- You don't love me.
Do you want me to go through life remembering that I ran out... on one of my two best friends?
After what they did to Higginbotham, and dragging you up here again?
That's just the way of showing their friendship.
I hate the army, I'm through with it, but friendship, that's something else.
But we're wasting valuable time.
You have to understand. I'll be right back.
- I want to talk to you.
- You? I don't want to argue...
I'm going if I have to shoot you and go alone.
You know as well as I do why you can't go.
If anything happens to you,
I'd be in a fine mess.
Your girl would prefer charges.
- She wouldn't.
- I don't trust her.
There's only one way I'll risk it.
- What's that?
- For you to sign up.
When we get Cutter, we'll tear up the papers.
It'll be according to regulations.
Is that fair enough for you?
You're getting clever again.
Do you want me to get kicked out of the army?
All right, I'll sign, but on one condition.
That I hold the blank in my hand and I keep it after I'm through.
You don't trust me.
That's right.
All right.
What are you doing with that in your pocket?
I always carry one. In case.
No, you don't.
Not a word of this to Emmy, you understand? Shake on it?
Hurry up.
Excuse me, miss.
Sgt. Ballantine and I are going out on a reconnoitering expedition.
- Yes, sir.
- If we're not back by morning... inform the Colonel, and you follow our trail.
- Come this way.
- Excuse me, Miss Stebbins.
- I'm going, Emmy. He's changed his mind.
- Who made him change it?
- Reason and common decency.
- You're lying.
Would I lie at a time like this, just before our wedding? Be reasonable.
You didn't sign anything?
Why ask a question like that?
Do I look that stupid?
Just pretend I'm going off on a picnic.
That's all it'll amount to.
We'll get Cutter out of that gold temple without firing a shot, just by strategy.
We've done things like this before.
It's just a lot of fun.
- Fun? You want to go.
- Darling...
- Sgt. Ballantine, fall in!
- Right, sir.
He called you sergeant.
Why? You're not in the army.
It's just an old habit, hard to break.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Why don't you come right out and say you don't want to get married?
You'd rather be with him.
Why fool me by telling me how you hated him and his ugly face... and all the ugly faces in the army?
- I didn't say quite that. Be fair.
- Please, sahib, hurry.
- Come on, Sergeant!
- Can't you wait a minute?
Sure, I can wait, but I'm not so sure about Cutter.
- Can't you trust me? Kiss me goodbye.
- No, never.
They're probably slicing Cutter's ears off by now.
- I'm coming, Mac!
- Darling, please don't go.
You don't want a man for a husband.
You want a coward who'll run out on a friend in danger.
That's not me, and never will be.
I don't care how much I love you, and I do, very much...
I'm a soldier... I mean, I'm a man first.
All right, MacCheesecake, get that silly smirk off your face.
- Come on.
- Let's go.
Surely Mother Kali is kind.
One Englishman fly walks in, and now our web is baited.
More will follow.
Two more have crossed the bridge.
It is well. Prepare.
You said this place was full of priests.
- Sahib do not give Din chance to say.
- You've got a mouth, haven't you?
Quiet. It's Kali.
A Thug temple.
Why didn't you tell me they were Thugs?
I've a good mind to split you in two and stuff you up an elephant's trunk.
MacChesney roar so loud... poor bhisti cannot get a word sideways between roarings.
Enough of that. We're here to find Cutter.
We should have brought every man in the regiment.
I only wish you had, sahib.
Hello, Din.
Fine work, bugler. I knew you'd do it.
Thank you, sahib.
- Hello, boy.
- Hello, mate.
You're alive, anyway. What's this?
I'll chop you down right away.
So there you are, you white-livered elephant-stealing treasure hunter.
Look at you, hanging there like a lamb in a butcher's shop.
Where's the troop?
There's no troop, and the Guru has us.
We right walked into it.
You mean to tell me you didn't bring the troop?
What a brain!
I round up every Thug in India, and you mess it up with that pygmy brain!
I couldn't face my own men if I brought them to witness your shame... disgracing Her Majesty's uniform.
Shame? They're doing this to me to find out where the column is.
They plan to ambush and massacre the Colonel and the whole troop.
- You didn't tell them, did you?
- Not me.
So I suppose you think you're a hero?
- That's right.
- A hero. Don't make me laugh.
Every man at the post looking for these blighters... and I reconnoiter adroitly and encounter them... while you cowards hide behind your telegraph poles in Tantrapur.
Who's a coward?
- Untie him, will you?
- Yes. Untie me.
I said untie him!
Sgt. Ballantine, untie that man!
You displease me greatly, and I ignore the both of you.
- I'll untie him myself.
- Yes, that's right.
Only one hand, that's all I need at you.
Just one hand.
- Hurry up about it.
- I'll take all day, if you order me around.
I owe you one, anyway.
Mate, look at your back.
- Never mind that. Untie my hands.
- Just look what they did to you.
I'm sorry, mate. The fiends!
- The Guru.
- Filthy scum.
- Dog.
- Maniac.
- Let's get him.
- Here we go.
Grab him regardless how many are with him. It's our only chance.
He's sacred, so they won't shoot us.
Why, you hairless dog.
Look what you did to that man's back, you filthy...
A lesson in the error of false pride, Sergeant.
You're talking very proudly yourself.
Perhaps you're not too proud to give a little information I seek.
- I want to know about your army.
- Why don't you enlist, mate?
Lash.
For a beginning, this is not bad.
Three soldiers to be given to Mother Kali... three soldiers and a slave.
- Who is slave? I am a soldier, too, please.
- You're what?
Regimental bhisti.
Proud ox, where is your army?
How soon are they to follow?
Wouldn't you like to know?
Why don't you look in your crystal ball?
Make the ox talk.
You dirty pack of cowards!
Never mind him. Now. He's next.
- I'm waiting. Will you speak?
- I don't know.
Hold on, Mac, old boy!
Stop.
Look. See them down there... coiling and wiggling, sticking their pretty tongues out?
Are you going to speak?
Throw him in. He'll talk from there.
- No, I can't stand it!
- Will you speak?
All right.
If I ain't kissed by one of them snakes, I'll tell you.
Take me outside.
- Be a man, Mac.
- I can't go it, mates!
Come back, Mac, old boy!
- Well, Sergeant?
- All right, guvnor.
I don't know the exact position of the troops... but in Ballantine's pocket there's a paper with all the troop movements in it.
- You're sure of that, Sergeant?
- As sure as taxes, guvnor.
- I wouldn't fool you.
- I hope not.
If you have, there'll be worse than lashes.
Please don't lash me any more.
I'll relieve you of these.
Cut him down.
"Sgt. Thomas Ballantine hereby reenlists."
That's you, MacChesney, always hiding behind regulations... you Brummagem turncoat!
Be gallant in defeat, Sergeant.
You're simply a victim of superior strategy.
Quiet, you Whitechapel scum, or I'll cut your slaggedy hands off at the wrist!
- I'll pay you back with horrible interest!
- I command you to shut up!
Tell your men to lay down their arms and get out of here, or you're a dead kipper.
Lay down your arms and leave.
- Where do those stairs lead to?
- Not to freedom.
- We'll see about that. Ready?
- Right.
- Sgt. Cutter, guard that door.
- Right. Mac, take your coat.
Right. Get up.
It's young Toad Face blazing up the Thugs.
I'll start with him first.
No, you won't.
Gentlemen, what do you think of your freedom now?
All right, my friend, if we've got to die, you've got to die, too.
As long as I'm alive, you live.
- What did he say?
- He says he'll be unharmed.
He says to keep order, be confident, and wait.
Congratulations, Sergeant... on your knowledge of our humble language.
That's enough. Get under the shade... before you get sunstroke.
Go on. Get on back.
Wounds feel satisfactory, sahib?
I ain't had a more satisfactory set of welts since I ran away from home.
- Thank you.
- Fall in.
Come on.
- Get down. Look out.
- Watch your head.
- The gold!
- Yes, sahib, gold!
Look at it, mates! Gold! That's what it is!
- Real solid sunshine!
- Sit down, you fool!
See that hand sticking out?
I bet that little hand's worth £3,000 if it's worth a farthing!
Who's a blinking idiot now?
We're rich, mates. Come on!
All right, Mr. Wise Man, here's my last offer.
You order your men to get in behind them rocks... and you see us down as far as the bridge.
We'll let you loose, and there's no harm done.
How's that?
Speak, you ape, or I'll kill you.
You would throw away your shield, brave soldier?
- Do you hear something, Bal?
- The bagpipes, Mac?
I've been hearing them for hours, but it isn't them.
It's the blistering heat screaming in our ears... that makes it sound like it.
They'll pull us out, old boy... if they can find the blasted place.
Don't waste any of your guff on me, Mac.
Here we are, and this is it.
It might have been worse, though.
I might have left a widow.
Eight feet away from where I'm sitting, right here... there's enough gold to make me sole owner and proprietor... of a pub as big as the Crystal Palace.
Best pub in Hampshire. And here I am.
You torturer!
Setting that in front of my eyes.
Is there no limit to the torture an Oriental mind can think up?
So help me, if you mention gold again,
I'll tear the tongue out of your head.
Here it is. Get it.
Brave soldiers, can it be that your nerves are tightening?
We can stand it up here as long as you can, Mr. Wise Man.
Preserve your courage, gentlemen.
You are not forgotten.
They will come to save you.
That's right, mate.
You're going to see more soldiers than you ever saw before.
Gentlemen, good news.
Here's a sight that should make your hearts pound faster. Look.
The Lancers.
Look at the Black Watch out in front.
Those beautiful Scotties.
I'll buy them all a beer apiece.
Your comrades' coming chokes you with emotions.
Seeing them this way recalls to you all manner of pleasant things.
The gaiety of barrack life, old friendships... even England... even home.
You bet it does, mister.
Save your voices, gentlemen.
They're coming here to your rescue.
You tormenting fiend.
- You're so sure, aren't you?
- Quite sure. It is my plan.
Two come to rescue one... then the others follow.
If you planned it right, mate... you'll be hanging by your filthy neck by nightfall.
You think so, Sergeant?
I'm not so sure.
You seem to think warfare an English invention.
Have you never heard of
Chandragupta Maurya?
No.
He slaughtered all the armies left in India by Alexander the Great.
India was a mighty nation then... while Englishmen still dwelt in caves and painted themselves blue.
Look.
Don't be afraid, gentlemen.
I am still your shield.
It is very simple.
Your army will enter by that gap.
Then they'll proceed halfway down this gorge.
Those are my infantry.
The best mountain fighters in the world.
At a given signal, they will open fire on your troops... driving them forward into the trap.
That is my artillery.
Rather neatly concealed, don't you think?
My gunners greet them with a full salute.
And finally, in come my horsemen.
This is, gentlemen, my household cavalry... similar to that which guards the person of your Queen Empress.
Each man is mounted on a valiant charger... and eager to slay for his guru.
The honor of the thunder in and slaughter of your army falls to them.
I see it in your faces.
Who is this ugly little savage... to snarl so boldly at the British lion?
Prime generals, friends, are not made of jeweled swords and moustache wax.
They're made of what is there, and what is here.
- You're mad.
- Mad?
Hannibal was mad. Caesar was mad.
And Napoleon surely was the maddest of the lot.
Ever since time began... they've called mad all the great soldiers in this world. Mad?
We shall see what wisdom lies within my madness... for this is but the spring freshet that precedes the flood.
From here we roll on, from village to town... from town to mighty city, ever mounting, ever widening... until at last my wave engulfs all India.
My soldiers! March!
- Toad Face, if you make a move...
- Stop, or I'll slit his throat.
Obey me, my son!
Beloved guru, our men will not move if it is to cost your life.
What is my life to the life of our cause? Go!
- No! They will not let you die.
- Go!
No, you don't. We need you.
Wait a minute.
You have sworn as soldiers, if need be, to die for your faith... which is your country, your England.
India is my country and my faith... and I can die for my faith and my country... as readily as you for yours.
Go, chota.
India, farewell.
You have warned the English.
You must die.
Our guru has given his life for our cause. We must not fail him now!
We must get up there and warn the Scotties before they're trapped.
We may not warn them, but we've got to try.
Come on, mates. Let's go.
- Good work, soldier!
- Thank you, sahib.
Look.
Before I have your faces tied to bags of hot ashes...
I want you to watch as though you were rajahs at an Imperial Durbar... while your comrades are slain to the last man.
Bonnie Charlie's now awa '
Safely owre the friendly main
Mony a heart will break in twa
Should he no' come back again
You see, soldiering isn't all war,
Mr. Journalist.
Will ye no' come back again
They're coming in.
- The Colonel's got to know.
- Yes.
Trumpeter, sound off.
Shoot him down!
- You take the left flank, I'll take the right.
- Yes, sir.
They're getting away! Fire!
Good work, bugler.
Fire! Charge!
Cut their heads off.
- Poor old Din. What a mate.
- Mac, look! Here they come!
- Come on!
- Hit them again!
Get them off!
Speak to me, Bal.
They've killed him!
You'll pay for this.
I'll make you pay for this.
Take that. And that!
That's right. I don't trust you.
Why, you dirty, scheming scum.
You rotter.
Charge!
- Everything cleaned up, sir.
- Nice work, Mitchell.
Thank you, sir.
Firing party, halt.
Inwards, turn!
Fire three volleys in the air. Ready!
Present. Fire!
Ready!
Present. Fire!
- Very good, my boy.
- Thank you, Colonel.
- Not half bad.
- Thank you, Colonel.
Let's take a look to the men.
Stand easy, men.
We've all done enough soldiering for one long day.
You were fine today. Particularly fine.
I'd sooner hear that from you, sir, than get a blooming medal.
Thank you, sir.
Perhaps you'd take care of this for me, sir.
And here's a man of whom the regiment will always be proud.
According to regulations, he had no actual status as a soldier.
But those who had the privilege of serving with him today... know that if ever a man deserved the name and rank of soldier... it was he. So I'm going to appoint him a corporal in this regiment.
His name will be written on the rolls of our honored dead... and I...
Let me see that last part again, will you, Mr. Kipling?
Present arms!
"So I'll meet 'im later on
"At the place where 'e is gone
"Where it's always double drill and no canteen
"He'll be squatting on the coals
"Giving drink to poor damned souls
"And I'll get a swig in Hell from Gunga Din
"Yes, Din, Din, Din
"You Lazarushian-leather Gunga Din.
"Tho' I've belted you and flayed you
"By the living God that made you
"You're a better man than I am,
Gunga Din!"
Forward turn!
Straight march!
English
Larry, give me one of those empty jars.
Fill them up, will you?
Extra!
Read all about it!
Give us a swig.
-Hello, Tommy.
-Hello.
Can grease?
Come on, Matt. We got business.
Give us a little kiss.
That's what you get for fooling with women.
Hey, little boy, stop.
Stop, I say! Stop that!
Officer, get those boys.
You little scamps! If I get ahold of you....
Matt, look.
That ain't fair, Tom.
-What do you care? It's only a girl.
-She's my sister, ain't she?
What difference does that make?
Help me up, Matt.
Leave her alone. She's doing fine.
That's the way to learn.
That's just like you, Tom Powers.
You're the meanest boy in town.
He is not.
He give you his skates, didn't he?
I believe he did it just so he could play that trick on me.
-I'm gonna tell your brother Mike.
-Go ahead and tell him.
Here he comes now.
You'll help me, won't you, Mike?
-Where'd you get the skates, Molly?
-Tom gave them to me.
Tom did? Where'd you get them, Tom?
He got them from a kid who owed him some money.
I'll bet you stole them, Tom.
Give them back, Molly.
Why don't you mind your own business?
Nobody asked you to put your two cents in.
Here, Tom.
I don't want them if you stole them.
-So you're getting like sissy Mike, too.
-Take them, Tom.
You ain't so darn good.
Your old man swipes pigeons.
Tom Powers, he does not!
You're a big liar.
He's in jail.
They don't put people there for nothing.
Everybody who belongs there, ain't there.
That's where you'll be someday,
Tom Powers.
I ain't there yet.
If I do go, it won't be for swiping pigeons.
Tell him you were only kidding, Tom.
How do you want them this time: up or down?
Three for me, too. Three skins.
-Hello there.
-How's it going?
How are you?
Hit you. There you are.
-Hit me again.
-Hit you. There's one.
Hit you again. There you go.
Hey, Putty Nose.
All right. I'll be back in a minute, boys.
Hello, boys. What's up?
-We've got something.
-Really?
Fine. I'll bet you a nickel.
-Where'd you get them?
-Wentworth Avenue.
How much are they worth?
Not much. Just cheap watches.
-Cheap watches? $1 apiece.
-Yeah, and there's six of them, too.
I don't know what I can do with them.
They're hot.
Come on. Quit stalling, Putty Nose.
You know how to sell them.
You're too smart.
-I'll see what I can do with them.
-How much do we get?
What do you say to 50 cents for each of them?
-50 cents?
-I ain't cheating you. That's a good price.
I have to take all the risk, and maybe I can't sell them at all.
Give us the 50 cents.
You know old Putty Nose always plays on the square with you, don't you?
-This is only two bits.
-Yeah, and this is only a nickel.
-My mistake.
-Yeah.
All right.
Your brother owes me a month's dues to the club, don't you?
-That's right, Tom.
-So we're calling that square, see?
-That's all right, isn't it?
-Sure.
You've done a good stroke of business.
And if you find anything more... you'll just remember old Putty Nose, won't you?
Okay. Let's scram.
What do we want with a couple of young squirts like them for?
They ain't gonna be so bad.
They won't expect much of a cut.
-Hey there, Tom.
-Hello, Putty Nose.
Hello, boys.
Are you alone?
I'm always alone when I'm with Matt.
You looking for a sock on the button?
I was afraid you might have brought Mike with you.
That sucker.
He's too busy going to school.
He's learning how to be poor.
Ain't he working on the streetcars anymore?
Sure. He's a ding-ding in the daytime, goes to school at night.
What do you want us for, Putty?
Something sweet.
Remember how I always said... when I got something good, I'd cut you in?
Now, Dutch here knows the whole layout.
We've been casing the joint for a whole week.
-How about the cops?
-You ain't afraid of cops.
There ain't gonna be no trouble... and if there is,
I promise you that I'll protect you.
Now, Limpy here will be lookout.
The place is dead at night, anyhow.
Well, are you on?
-We ain't never done nothing so big.
-"Big" is right.
I'm giving you a break, like I promised.
Furs is worth plenty nowadays.
How about you, Tom?
-It's kind of new stuff for me.
-You gotta grow up sometime.
Wait a minute.
Christmas present from Santa Claus.
With best wishes for a prosperous new year.
-I'm scared stiff.
-Come on, ain't nothing to be scared of.
Is that so?
Look at you, you're shaking yourself.
Take it off me, will you?
Stop!
You tried to get away, did you?
They got Limpy Larry.
Stop there!
-Where's that big loony?
-Where's Putty? We knocked off a--
Yeah, I know all about it.
Putty Nose beat it.
You better lay low for a while.
The heat's on.
But Putty Nose got us into this.
He promised to see us through.
Why, that dirty, no-good, yellow-bellied stool.
I'm gonna give it to him right in the head the first time I see him.
Yeah? You and who else?
My Larry.
He was a good boy.
Larry got what he asked for. I warned him.
He was a no-good boy.
My Larry was a good boy.
He got into bad company, that's all.
Come here, Tommy boy.
I'm so glad you came, Tommy.
Mrs. Dalton will be pleased to see some of Larry's nicer friends.
"U.S. declares war." Read all about it!
Wait a minute, Tom. Here comes Mike.
Extra! Read all about it.
You should come on home with me, Molly.
I don't know just how to tell Mom.
All right, Mike.
That sister of yours ain't getting any bargain in Mike.
How come he ain't working?
I guess he got fired for snatching too many nickels.
-They look like something's happened.
-Come on, we gotta see Paddy.
You don't need to stall with Paddy Ryan, Tom.
I've been watching you ever since you bought your first drink from me.
I know what you been doing.
You see, Paddy, it's like this.
We delivered some cigars today.
Must be worth about $2,500.
Took them to a place on 63rd and was told to put them in the back.
-We could lift them easy tonight.
-But we don't know what to do with them.
You sell cigars, don't you?
Not that kind. Can't afford it.
I've got my own system, boys, but being a fence ain't part of it.
-We thought maybe you know somebody.
-Maybe I do.
You might take them there.
-I'll call up and say you're coming.
-Thanks, Paddy.
Wait a minute.
If you get in a jam, give me a ring.
You'll find out Paddy Ryan's your friend.
Thanks, Paddy.
Why do you want to front for us?
We ain't never done nothing for you.
Maybe not.
But I may need a friend myself sometime.
I'm older than you... and I've learned that nobody can do much without somebody else.
Remember this, boys:
You gotta have friends.
I've been watching and hearing about you, and I've been worried.
I was worried when you got mixed up with that two-timer Putty Nose.
Such guys are dangerous.
I'm glad you come to me.
As far as I'm concerned, there's only two kinds of people: right and wrong.
Now, I think you're right.
You'll find that I am, unless you cross me.
That's swell.
Don't cry. Everything will be all right.
Hello, Ma.
Tommy boy.
You won't leave me, will you, Tommy?
You're all I've got left now, Tommy boy.
What's the matter, Ma? What's up?
Mike's enlisted.
Enlisted? In the Army?
-ln the Marines.
-But you won't go, Tommy.
Promise me you won't go.
You're just a baby.
Now, listen, Ma--
If your pa was alive,
I wouldn't care so much.
Promise me, Tommy.
I won't go, Ma. When's he going?
As soon as he gets his call.
He's up packing now.
Go up and see him, Tommy.
We ought to be very proud of him.
-Hello, Mike.
-Hello, Tom.
I'm glad you came. I suppose you've heard.
Yeah. Kind of rushing it, ain't you?
Well, Tom, when your country needs you, she needs you.
I suppose you think I ought to go, too.
No. Maybe it was selfish of me, Tom... but somebody's got to stay here and take care of Ma.
You earn more money than I do, and they'd have called me first anyway.
-You always did get all the breaks.
-Don't take it like that, Tom.
You've got to be the man of the family now.
And while we're on the subject, I wish you'd try to stay home a little more.
-I gotta work, ain't l?
-Sure.
Listen, I was in a place today, and I heard somebody say something.
-What of it?
-Well, they were saying....
It seemed as though they were pointing a finger at you and Matt.
Who was?
What rat would say anything about me--
Now take it easy.
You're always hearing things.
You'll get too much in your nose someday and wonder how you got it.
For crying out loud,
I heard some guys talking about you... saying you were in on some crooked work.
What am I supposed to do? Run?
You ain't asking me, you're telling me.
And I don't know a thing, see?
All I've got to say is that you've got a good job now.
You don't need these rats you're running with.
You want me to go to night school and read poems.
I've been hearing a few things myself.
-There's nothing to hear about me.
-That's all you know.
You ain't so smart.
Books don't hide everything.
-You're a liar. You're covering up.
-Covering up for what? For you?
-You're nothing but a sneak thief.
-What did you say?
You heard me, a petty larceny sneak thief.
Robbing the streetcar company.
Don't you think that booze ain't gonna be valuable.
I heard today that alcohol's gone to $30 a gallon.
The real McCoy's hard to get.
All you gotta do when you deliver a good shipment... is size up the layout and let me know.
I can use some of it.
I know two or three others that'll buy all that I can't handle.
It means real dough, a three-way split.
I said we'd get together sometime, didn't l?
Well, the time has come now.
Grab the rope.
One jerk to start, and two to stop.
Thanks, Hymie.
There.
-Are you satisfied?
-I'll say.
Pretty soft, wasn't it?
How do you like playing with Paddy?
-I wonder what to do with so much dough.
-You ain't started.
I'll make big shots out of you yet.
-Anything you say goes for me, Paddy.
-Me, too.
And here's to us.
31.5 inches.
Don't forget, plenty of room in there.
Sir. Here's where you need the room.
Such a muscle.
Make it snappy or you'll find out what it's for.
-Yeah, come on. Let's get out of here.
-Yes, sir.
22.5 inches.
Did you read about that big robbery at the booze warehouse?
42.5 inches.
-Right under their very noses.
-Yeah, a guy was just telling me about it.
33.5 inches.
If those men get away with that, they'll be rich for life.
37.5 inches.
Did you read what it said in the papers? 150,000.
150,000 inches.
Dollars.
Why don't you two mugs get an adding machine?
All through now, gentlemen. Thank you.
Don't forget what I told you.
Plenty of room there.
Yeah, and remember: six buttons.
Be careful, Matt, or you're going to cut the nose right off of you.
-lf it ain't Mr. Tom and Mr. Matt.
-Hello, George. How's business?
-Big night.
-Good.
Hey, stoop, that's got gears!
It ain't no Ford!
Okay, boss.
Mr. Powers, Mr. Doyle. Alone as usual?
I am, but Matt's all fixed up.
He's got me with him.
The night's young yet.
-You'll wind up with something.
-Yeah, with the morning paper.
-Couple of lightweights.
-Yeah, flat tires.
Why don't you send them home to their mothers?
-They're no good to the joint anymore.
-And the ladies, too?
Don't be silly.
How about something with ice in it?
Well, we're with friends.
Yeah, I know it. I'm one of them.
Hello, baby.
-What are you going to have?
-Anything you say, big boy.
You're a swell dish.
I think I'm going to go for you.
-Look at what I got measured for.
-I don't even know you're here.
Come on.
Then it's a deal?
If you can assure me my name will be protected.
You'll be protected all over the place.
Hello, boys.
You can take off those clothes.
You got new jobs.
First, meet Mr. Leehman.
These are the two lads
I was telling you about.
Sit down, boys.
How do you like the brewery business?
-We don't know nothing about it.
-You will.
You're in it now.
Mr. Leehman and I got it all fixed.
Mr. Leehman owns that big brewery over on Union Avenue.
-But that's been closed since--
-Yeah. It's going to open up.
You spoke of a rather remarkable man from the West Side.
Nails Nathan.
-Paddy, is Nails throwing in with us?
-He'll be here any minute.
I don't believe I'm acquainted with the gentleman.
Then you're the only man in town that ain't.
At least everybody's heard of him, boys.
Believe me, Mr. Leehman, when Nails and his mob start on a job... it's already done.
That Schemer Burns' crowd tries to muscle in on us...
I pity them.
You understand that my desire is merely to furnish a better grade of beer... than the working man can now obtain...
-under the present, unfortunate--
-ln your hat.
And again in your hat, mister.
I've heard that north wind blow before.
If you're in this, you're in for the coins, same as the rest of us.
-Gentlemen, meet Nails Nathan.
-Born Samuel.
Tom Powers, glad to know you.
And you're Matt Doyle.
-How are you? Sit down, fellas.
-How'd you know?
Know all about you.
Paddy has been talking.
Meet Mr. Leehman, Nails.
Tickled pink. Don't take offense at anything I say, Mr. Leehman.
If we're in this racket together, we got to keep the cheaters off, right?
My name is not to appear--
Don't worry.
We won't use it in our advertising.
Paddy, the mob's all ready by the time you can open.
Got some swell routes laid out for you, and the stock's all marked.
You mean, you have the customers all signed up?
-Signed up?
-Yes, sir.
Signed up or sealed up.
Tom and Matt here is the official signers and sealers.
-The trouble squad.
-And if they need any help...
Nails has got some pretty handy boys with their gloves all oiled.
Dear me, I'm afraid this means--
It means they buy our beer or they don't buy any beer.
All right, Dutch, get going.
And don't take any back talk from those speakies.
Tell them, "Here's the beer you ordered."
If they doubt you, call Matt and Tom.
All right, Matt, Tom, get going.
-Hello, Steve. How's business?
-Business?
Business is on the bum.
That's with telling us you only took two kegs of beer last trip...
-but now you don't want any at all.
-Business is on the bum.
Give us a couple of beers.
That'll help a little.
-That ain't our beer.
-Where'd you get this slop?
It's good, ain't it?
And it's cheaper than yours.
How much you paying for this stuff?
-Two bits a glass.
-All right. Screw.
I thought so.
You can sell ours for the same price.
Get your hands off that!
Somebody's got to protect your customers.
What can I do? I can't help it if I have to buy from Schemer Burns.
-They tell me the same thing that you do.
-You're yellow.
Please, you ain't gonna slug me, are you?
Maybe not today.
But I'm telling you this for the last time.
When Dutch comes, he will leave some beer.
You're going to take it and kick in with the dough.
If you don't, somebody will come and kick your teeth out one at a time. Get me?
You'll be needing some right away.
How many should we leave?
-Two kegs.
-You hear that, Dutch? Bring in five kegs.
"Mr. and Mrs. Patrick J. Ryan."
"Mr. and Mrs. Bernard Grogan."
"Welcome home, Michael Powers."
"Samuel Nathan"?
I never heard of him.
Nails Nathan. One of Tom's new friends.
What's Tom doing now, Pat?
Mother said something about a political job.
Yeah? And that ain't all.
He and Matt have been running around... with a couple of girls at the Washington Arms Hotel.
Now, the worst part of it all is that he's been lying to his mother.
He's leaving her think that he's made an honest success.
Why, sure it's only a question of time when he's going to be caught.
And then he'll be after breaking her poor heart.
But what's he doing?
Beer. Bootleg.
He's one of Paddy Ryan's gang.
But that's not all.
Sure, they stop at nothing.
You either take their beer, or they put you on the spot.
I tell you, Michael, it is a wicked business.
Why, only last week....
-Got it?
-Yeah, I got it.
That's nice of you, Tommy... but I don't think
Mike will be able to drink any.
It's the best beer in town.
It'll do him good.
Dinner's all ready, Michael.
-Shall I help you in?
-No, Mother. I can make it.
I'll be getting along. I'll see you all later.
Bye-bye.
How's the meat, Mikey?
Fine, Ma.
I wish you'd eat more.
Try some of this cabbage.
I've had plenty, Ma.
Say, we haven't drunk to your health yet.
This is a swell celebration.
There you are, Mike.
-That's enough for you, Ma.
-Put a head on that, will you?
Miss Powers.
Well, here's to you, Mike.
Why don't you drink, Mike?
Come on, it's only beer.
I don't want any, Matt.
What's eating you?
I'm not interfering with your drinking.
If you want to drink it, go on.
If I don't want to, I don't have to.
So beer ain't good enough for you?
You think I'd care if it was just beer in that keg?
I know what's in it.
I know what you've been doing... how you got those clothes and those new cars.
You've been telling Ma you're in politics, that you're on the city payroll.
Pat Burke told me everything.
You murderers!
There's not only beer in that keg, there's beer and blood.
The blood of men!
You ain't changed a bit.
Besides, your hands ain't so clean.
You killed and liked it.
You didn't get them medals for holding hands with Germans.
Please, he ain't himself.
He don't know what he's talking about.
This trip's been too much for the poor soul.
Lord have pity on him.
Please, Tommy.
Come on, Matt. Let's get out of here before I go screwy, too.
Don't go away, Tommy. Don't be angry.
You can send my clothes to the Washington Arms Hotel.
Get up, lazybones.
What are you gonna do, sleep all day?
Button up. I can sleep as long as I like.
That's a fine way to talk to me after I cooked this lovely breakfast for you.
With my own lily-white hands.
Lake View 8515. Right.
-Hello?
-Hello, is Tom there?
I just called his apartment. They said he stepped across the hall for breakfast.
Nails Nathan.
Just a minute. Tom, it's for you.
-Who is it?
-Nails Nathan.
-Hello, kid.
-Hello, Tom.
-What's the matter, kid?
-Nothing.
Only the dame's beginning to get on my nerves, that's all.
Listen, I'm getting fed up on these rubber checks bouncing in.
We're laying down good beer and getting nothing but a lot of bum paper.
I got one this morning for $1,200 from that Pete over on Kedzie Avenue.
Get over there. I want that dough.
Cash or his heart.
If you can't bring in one, bring in the other.
I'll bring you both. Leave it to me, kid.
All right.
Come on in, Matt. Shake a leg.
Nails wants us to do him a favor.
In a minute.
It's all ready, Tom.
-Ain't you got a drink in the house?
-Not before breakfast, dear.
I didn't ask you for any lip.
-I asked you if you got a drink.
-I know, Tom...
-but I wish--
-There you go with that "wishing" stuff.
I wish you was a wishing well... so that I could tie a bucket to you and sink you.
Maybe you found someone you like better.
How goes it, babe?
-Going south?
-Yes.
But I'm not accustomed to riding with strangers.
We're not going to be strangers.
-How far are you going?
-Pretty far. Near Jackson Park.
-ls that out of your way?
-No.
My chauffeur's just crazy about long drives.
Step on it, James.
Well, do I look good to you?
-You sure do.
-I feel flattered.
You know, you're not the worst I've seen, either.
-From Chicago?
-Not exactly. I came from Texas.
-Where you living?
-The Congress Hotel.
If you're a stranger here,
Tom and me will show you the town.
Stick to your driving, mug.
Say, you can let me off here.
I'm going to meet my friends on the corner.
Could I see you again later?
I'd be happy to have you call me sometime.
I mean, later today.
I'll think it over. Give me your phone number and I'll call you.
All right, babe. Yards 3771.
I'll remember it.
And in the meantime, thanks.
-My name is Gwen. Gwen Allen.
-And mine's Tom Powers.
-Yeah, and mine is Matt.
-He ain't got a name, just a number.
She's a honey. I could go for her myself.
What do you mean, you could go for her yourself?
You could go for an 80-year-old chick with rheumatism.
When are you going to see her?
-She's going to call me.
-Find out if she's got a friend.
What do you want with her friend?
You got Mamie, ain't you?
Ain't you going to kiss your little baby?
-You got Kitty, ain't you?
-I ain't going to have her much longer.
I'm fed up. You can tell her so for me.
Step on the gas, will you?
Max, George, quick.
Delighted to see you, Mr. Nathan.
-How are you, Joe?
-Fine, thank you.
Where would you like to sit?
Where do I always sit?
Right at the ringside.
-May be full up there.
-We can fix that, sir.
Max, George, fix a table immediately at the railing for Mr. Nathan.
Great. The best is none too good tonight.
This is a wedding celebration.
-Really?
-Yep.
Matt's decided to take something lawful: a wife.
-That's something to celebrate about.
-I should say so.
-Meet Mr. and Mrs. Doyle.
-We're honored, I assure you.
-Let's dance while they're fixing the tables.
-This way, please.
-Hiya, Nails.
-Hello, Tom.
-How are you, Mr. Nathan?
-Harry, making money?
-Right this way, please.
-Hello, Jim. How are you?
-Are you as happy as I am, Matt?
-Sure, honey.
You fellows don't know what it means to a girl, getting married.
You knew all the time
I was going to marry you, didn't you?
Of course I did.
I was just thinking of Tom and Kitty.
Well, they're different.
I guess Tom ain't the marrying kind.
No, I guess not.
Are you sure that was old Putty Nose?
-I ought to know him when I see him.
-Sure you know him.
I suppose you'd like to put in with him again.
That's the Fagin that put something over on you, ain't it?
I had to laugh when I heard about that.
That guy's going to get you again.
He thinks you're soft.
-He ain't going to get me.
-We don't want any part of him.
I haven't got a thing to say, boys.
But they got the lndian sign on you, Tom.
-He thinks you're a cinch.
-ln a pig's eye.
That McGonagall ain't got a chance.
Take care of the women, Nails.
You're not going out in the cold, dark night, are you?
Nails will see that you get home.
We got a little job to do.
Come on, Matt.
You're not gonna leave me tonight, Matt?
There's something we forgot to do, honey.
I'll be home later.
Come on.
Where's he going?
They're just walking around the block to cool themselves off.
What are you worrying about? Sit down.
Have it ready at 8:00. Fill it with gas.
I'm going on a long trip.
Well, if it ain't Tom Powers and Matt, too.
How are you, boys?
-Been out of town?
-Yeah, I was down home, visiting.
-Got a little drink for us, Putty?
-Sure, Tom.
But I can't let you in just now.
You see, I've got a Jane inside.
I'll bring it right out to you.
Wait a minute, Putty Nose.
-We got words for you.
-What's up, Tom?
We got a little business to settle,
Jane or no Jane.
You ain't sore, are you, Tom?
I've always been your friend.
Sure. You taught us how to cheat, steal, and kill. Then you lammed out on us.
If it hadn't been for you, we might have been on the level.
Sure. We might have been ding-dings on a streetcar.
Come on.
A Jane, huh?
There ain't no one here but him.
I thought so.
Why, you dirty, double-crossing....
What are you squawking about?
You got plenty more coming.
What are you gonna do?
I don't want to die.
So you don't want to die?
Tommy, don't you remember you and Matt... how you used to be just kids and how we were friends?
You won't let him, Matt.
I'll do anything for you from now on.
Ain't you got a heart, Matty boy?
Don't you remember how I used to play to you?
And didn't I always stick up for you?
I ain't got this coming.
Please, Matt, don't let him.
I ain't a bad fellow, really.
Tommy, don't. Ain't you got a heart?
Tell me you won't let him, Matt, will you?
You remember that song I used to sing?
That song I taught you?
You remember, Tommy.
Back in the club, how you kids used to laugh at that song.
Guess I'll call up Gwen.
She ought to be home by now.
Let me make you a cup of tea.
I got to be getting back on the job in a minute.
My, but it's good to see you again.
I was beginning to think I'd lost you.
You can't lose me that easy.
Poor Michael.
I'm afraid he's working himself into an early grave.
Days on the cars, school at night, and studying in between.
Listen, Ma,
I came over to give you something.
Here, take this.
When you need more, just say so.
I'm making plenty.
You're a good boy, Tommy, but I can't.
-Take it.
-Mike wouldn't like it.
-Mike ain't got nothing to say about it.
-No?
Listen to me.
I've got something important to say.
Keep it to yourself.
Nobody wants your two cents.
I don't want you two boys fighting.
It ain't right for two brothers.
There won't be fighting.
Only, I don't need his preaching.
-What is this, Ma?
-Tommy gave it to me to buy some things.
-Ain't that nice of him?
-It's more than you can do.
We don't want your money.
I'll look after Ma.
-On two bits a week?
-Ma don't drink champagne.
How do you know?
I used to dance when I was a girl.
I won't argue with you, and
I can't tell you all I'd like to in front of Ma.
But get an earful of this:
You ain't welcome in this house.
That's blood money. We want no part of it.
-Hiding behind Ma's skirts, like always.
-Better than hiding behind a machine gun.
You're too smart.
-I'm going, Ma.
-And don't forget your change.
-Money don't mean nothing to me.
-No, I guess not.
But with no heart or brains, it's all you've got. You'll need it.
Why you sneaking, stooling....
Michael, why did you hit him?
I may leave town next week.
You don't care, do you?
When I first met you,
I sort of figured you was on the make.
Not much. You know what I mean.
And besides that...
I figured you was sort of different, too.
That is, different from the kind of girls
I was used to.
I don't go in for these long-winded things, but with me, it was always yes or no.
And I could never figure you out.
-Now can you?
-No.
But I guess I ain't your kind.
-I think I better call it quits.
-Don't be like that, Tommy... because I "go for you," as you say.
Maybe too much.
You know, all my friends... think that things are different between us than they are.
They figure they know me pretty well... and don't think I'd go for a merry-go-round.
Do you think
I'm giving you a merry-go-round?
-No, l--
-Then do you want things to be different... to please your boyfriends?
No, but how long can a guy hold out?
I'm gonna go screwy.
-Where are you going?
-I'm gonna blow.
You're a spoiled boy, Tommy.
You want things, and you're not content until you get them.
Or maybe I'm spoiled, too.
Maybe I feel that way, too.
But you're not running away from me.
Come here.
Now you stay put, if you know what that means.
My bashful boy.
You are different, Tommy.
Very different.
And I've discovered it isn't only a difference in manner... and outward appearances.
It's a difference in basic character.
The men I know... and I've known dozens of them... they're so nice... so polished, so considerate.
Most women like that type.
I guess they're afraid of the other kind.
I thought I was, too.
But you're so strong.
You don't give, you take.
Tommy, I could love you to death.
Oh, nuts.
Is Tom here?
Nails is dead.
-Who killed him?
-Nobody. His horse.
He was thrown off in the park, kicked in the head.
-You got that horse that killed Nails?
-You mean Rajah?
He bad animal. Terrible.
Yeah, what's he worth?
Spirited horse.
I told Mr. Nathan not to ride him.
What's he worth?
He could be bought for $1,000.
You see, it's--
-Never mind. Here.
-Where's he at?
Stall Number 3.
Stay where you are.
Right now, we ain't got a chance.
Since Nails has gone, his mob has scattered. They're ten-to-one against us.
Look at this dump.
Four pineapples tossed at us in two days, and the brewery set fire.
I'm telling you, they got us on the run.
-Not me. I ain't running. I ain't yellow.
-Who said you was?
I ain't talking about that.
I'm gonna need you.
And you won't be no good to me when you're in the cemetery.
I got to have a couple of days to get the boys lined up again.
While I'm doing that... you'll be where nobody knows where to find you except me.
Come on, give me your guns and your money. All of it.
-What are you trying to pull, Paddy?
-I'm gonna keep you off the streets.
Even you wouldn't be sap enough to go for a stroll without your gat.
Come on, shower down.
All of it.
You got a phone here, Jane?
I'm gonna call Gwen.
No, you keep away from that phone.
I'll call from outside and tell her
I sent you out of town for a few days.
-And ring up Mamie, will you?
-Leave it to me.
This won't be for long, boys.
I'll have the mob lined up again in a couple of days.
You'll see that they're comfortable?
-You leave that to me, Paddy.
-Okay.
Gather round, boys.
We're going to be a happy, little family.
I hope you got plenty of this medicine.
Yards 6321.
Hello.
Is Schemer there?
Let me make you another drink, Tommy.
You mean to say you got any of that stuff left?
You haven't drank so much.
I can drink it as long as you can pour it.
Only a coal truck.
Had me going for a minute.
-Come on, get in the game, will you, Tom?
-No.
I'm gonna hit the hay.
I thought you'd like a little nightcap.
You don't need to feel ashamed in front of me.
Here, let me help you.
-I don't need any help.
-Be a good boy and sit down.
I'll take your shoes off, too.
I want to do things for you, Tommy.
You don't think I'm old, do you?
-No.
-You like me, don't you?
Sure.
What's the idea?
Just a goodnight kiss for a fine boy.
In your hat.
Get away from me.
You're Paddy Ryan's girl.
-Breakfast is all ready, Tommy.
-I ain't hungry.
Give me some coffee, will you?
And make it black.
You aren't sorry, are you?
-Sorry for what?
-For last night.
What do you mean, for getting drunk?
Aren't you the little playactor?
Wait a minute.
Do you mean that--
Why, you....
-Tom, where you going?
-Home.
-But Paddy--
-I don't care what Paddy said!
I'm getting out of this dump.
Hey, Tom, wait a minute.
-What happened?
-Nothing. I just got burned up, that's all.
What do you wanna run out on me for?
We're together, ain't we?
Sure.
Yes, sir?
I was looking at some of the pistols in the window.
-Shall I show you some?
-Yeah.
-I kind of like that big one.
-That one? All right.
-What do you call that?
-That's a.38 caliber. It's a fine--
You got any more like it?
-I've got some smaller ones.
-No, same size.
Sure.
-How do you load that?
-First you break it.
Then you stick the cartridges in the holes.
-Could I see?
-Sure.
-That's right.
-Like that?
-lt'll hold six.
-This will be enough.
Stick them up.
Okay, Schemer, it's all set.
I ain't so tough.
-Well, Doc, what do you think?
-Can't say.
We'll hope for the best.
Doctor, this is Tom's mother, brother, and Miss Doyle.
You can go in for a few moments,
Mrs. Powers.
Thank you, sir.
Tommy boy.
Do you know me?
Sure, Ma.
Mike's here.
He's come to see you.
-Hello, Mike.
-How are you, Tom, old scuff?
I've been wanting to see you.
You're gonna be seeing a lot of me, Tom.
There's something
I wanted to say to you, Mike.
-I'm sorry.
-Sorry for what?
I'm just sorry.
You know.
You and Mike are going to be friends again?
Sure.
Friends.
Boys, I'm so happy.
So happy.
Ma, you must like Mike a lot better than me.
No, Tommy boy. You're my baby.
Sure.
I'm your baby.
You're coming home, ain't you, Tommy?
To stay?
Sure.
Coming home.
I mean, if I can ever get out of here.
You're gonna get out of here, all right.
Why, of course you are.
You're going to get well and strong.
Both my boys back.
All of us together again.
I'm almost glad this happened.
And he really looked better today, did he, Michael?
Sure, Ma, a lot better. He was sitting up.
I told him you'd be in to see him tomorrow.
-And he'll be coming home soon, won't he?
-Sure, Ma.
Paddy, come in.
What's wrong? Is Tom--
They kidnapped him from the hospital this afternoon.
What? Who did?
Must have been the Burns mob.
First they give it to him in the back, then they take him when he's helpless.
Who knows what they're doing to him now.
-They ain't gonna get away with this.
-I'm doing all I can.
My boys are out in the street now.
I'll bring Tom back, if it's the last thing I do.
-I'm gonna--
-You're gonna... stay here at that phone and take messages.
I told my boys to call you up if they find anything.
-I'd like to smash--
-Listen...
I sent word to Burns that if he'd bring Tom back here tonight...
I'd quit the racket.
He could have it all.
I'd leave town and I won't come back.
-You think they'll do it?
-It's a sweet offer.
You stay here.
If you hear anything from any one of my boys... call me at my place.
I got to get back on the job.
Don't you like your dinner?
Why, I just ain't hungry, Ma.
I'll get it, Ma.
This is Mike.
When? You are?
Fine. Ma, they're bringing Tom home.
-They are? When?
-Right now. He's on his way.
-ls he all right?
-He must be.
-They wouldn't be bringing him home.
-It's wonderful.
I'll get his room ready.
I knew my baby would come home.
-Who called?
-One of Paddy's boys. Didn't say who.
-Molly dear?
-Yes, Mother?
Bring up some clean sheets out of the linen closet.
-Hurry, dear.
-All right.
I received your letter and got here as quickly as I could.
Now I am going to tell you why I sent for you.
20 years ago my brother and I quarreled over a woman he married her. They relocated near
Kennegamy house, northern Canada.
A child was born, a girl.
Wife died
I heard that my brother had strangely disappeared.
Lately I have had a desire to see that niece of mine.
And find out just what happened to my brother.
That's why I sent for you.
I am afraid I couldn't stand a drift.
I will be glad to do everything I can.
You know, I haven't forgotten that you were dad's best friend.
You see my brother's name was John Ball... wife's name was, Marie.
More likely, that will be the girls name too.
Its my hope that she will spend the remaining years of my life, here with me.
You know son?
Some day she is going to inherit this here, the ranch of the pines.
I understand and I will do my best to find her.
Couldn't ask no more than that.
- When can you leave?
- On the morning train..
Good!
Rod Drew!
What are you doing here?
Well hello Bobby?
Where are you heading for?
I am going home.
I just graduated.
That's nice!
Say, how is the old Alma Mater?
Oh, kind a quiet now... they haven't found any cows or goats in the dormitory since you left.
Don't tell me the place has deteriorated into a school of learning.
Sit down.
Oh, I cant now!
My mind is in the middle of a poker game.
But I have a lot to tell you,
I will be back later.
Okay.
- Don't loose your shirt!
- No!
I saw from where that one came from.
What are you doing, getting sore when you start to loose?
You tin horn...
I didn't do it, Rod.
They framed me.
I caught him cheating and he pulled a gun on me.
Its murder.
Come on.
Nice way to have a bath.
You shouldn't have done that Rod.
Now you are in it, as much as I am.
Don't worry about that, Bobby.
The main thing is to get out of here before they pick us up.
We are about a mile from Fort Minnetaki.
We should be able to buy a change of clothes there.
Lets get started.
Here you are, Mister.
Come on, Bobby.
Telegram for you Martial.
It must be that fellow who drifted down in this morning.
Well, there they are now.
We are going to have a talk with them.
Hey you fellas, wait a minute.
Wait a minute there.
Come on, Bobby.
That's them alright!
Come on lets run them down.
We got to jump for it.
It's our only chance.
They got away.
Notify the Mountain police.
From Minetaki they have headed north.
One of them is half-breed, but we do not have any description of the other.
- You better start at Fort Minnetaki.
- Yes Sir!
We can take a shortcut through Wabinosh
House, its on the bend of the river.
Once we make there, we will be safe for a while.
The cabin looks deserted.
We can camp there for the night.
Gold!
It's a map.
They must have fought for it.
Shows the location of their mine.
We, John Ball and Peter Plante... having discovered gold at this point do hereby agree to joint partnership in it and do pledge ourselves... to forgot our past differences and work in mutual goodwill and honesty
'so help us God' signed John Ball and Peter Plante.
So this is what happened to John Ball.
John Ball?
Why are you interested in him?
He is one of the reasons I am up here.
And the other?
His daughter.
Bobby, when we get to Wabinosh House... we will make a search for this mine.
Well, Bobby!
- Bobby!
- Felice!
Gee .. I am glad to see you.
I am glad to see you, Bobby.
Felice, this is Rod Drew.
My best friend in college.
Miss Newsome.
How do you do Miss Newsome?
How do you do Mister Drew.
Well how are you Bobby?
Glad to see you back.
I am glad to be back Mister Newsome.
Mister Newsome, this is Rod Drew.
How do you do Mister Newsome!
Howdy!
Are you going to be with us for some time?
No, I am afraid not. We are only going to stay long enough to get supplies.
Oh!
Where are you going?
Well! You see ..
We were thinking of hunting wolves.. and we want to get our trap plans plotted early.
Oh!
In the mean time I have some things here I would like to leave with you for safekeeping.
- Would you please keep this safe?
- Well, certainly!
- Benoit! Place this in the safe.
- Oui, monsieur.
Felice will get you what supplies you need.
We can put you up right here at the post.
Thanks Mister Newsome, that will be fine.
You boys come along with me now and I will show you to your room.
- Bonjour LaRocque.
- Bonjour. Eh! What have you got?
You wait I show you.
- More bullets, eh?
- Oui!
When the winter catches in we will attack Wabinosh House... and bring them to knees with their our own ammunition, eh?
Oui, and she is coming in pretty quick now.
And the ammunition is very low.
But Newsome, he don't know that.
I emptied his box and put them back on the shelves.
Good.
And now, I have the grand news for you.
Two strangers have arrived at the post with a map full of gold.
- A map of gold?
- Oui.
- Where is it?
- Je ne sais pas.
I have only seen the word 'Gold' marked on the map.
Newsome had me put it into the safe.
- You can open that safe?
- Do not know if I can do that.
- You try?
- Oui.
I will give you two men.
You will go there tonight.
Oui.
It is of no use,
I cannot get it.
But she can.
She knows the combination.
Ah!
- Benoit!
- Get her.
Ah, ah!
Felice, Felice!
She is gone!
Eh!
Who is this?
Its Abonga.
What are you doing here?
We found him wounded in Felice's room.
And she is gone.
Felice gone?
Ah!
LaRocque, eh?
I have seen him before must have taken her to his place.
Who is LaRocque?
Renegade trader stationed up in the river here been giving us plenty of trouble, what were they after?
There is nothing up here of value.
Not even in the safe.
- Maybe its the map.
- We got to find Felice!
- We better head for LaRocque.
- We can go by canoe.
No, you cannot go that way.
There's not enough water.
We might make it.
One thing for certain.
It sure would give them surprise if you did get through.
Come on, lets try it.
I couldn't open the safe, but Felice she knows the combination.
Get her and bring her here.
Jules LaRocque!
So you are behind all this?
You will tell us the combination of that safe and we will set you free.
I will tell you nothing.
Lets see maybe you will.
Take one of their guns and start something.
Meet me at the back door.
Bobby!
Get him!
My gosh, she is getting away.
Eh, Bobby!
I have been thinking, maybe Felice can help me with my quest.
So you are up here on a quest?
I didn't come here, just to hunt wolves.
I will be very careful, if I were you.
Man-hunters are not exactly welcomed by most people around here.
Its not a man I am looking for, its a woman.
A young woman.
She is just about your age.
That sounds interesting, tell me about it.
Don't you think we better inform your father that you are safe?
Perhaps you are right, Bobby.
You make big mistake when you bring that girl here.
I had too!
She has seen me.
And now I cannot go back.
We will send Marie!
She is not known there.
Oui, that's a good idea.
She can tell them she escaped from
Kennegamy House.
He will need someone for my place.
That stranger have a map of gold that you must get.
But you must not tell him anything.
- Leave it to me. I will get it.
- I know.
Excuse me, monsieur.
Are you Mr. Newsome?
Yes.
I am Marie LaFleur from Kennegamy House.
I was a clerk there, and also took care of the accounts.
I am looking for work.
- Can you keep books?
- Oui monsieur.
Well you have got a job right now as far as I am concerned.
If you can help me out of this mess.
That will be simple, monsieur.
I will go and have a room prepare for you right away.
Thank you.
Did you say your name was Marie?
Oui monsieur.
I heard you say that you are from
Kennegamy House.
Have you lived along there long?
You are very inquisitive, monsieur.
I don't mean to be, but I am very interested.
I would like to have a talk with you.
If you wish.
What's the matter Felice?
I don't see why he should be so interested in that girl.
What do you care?
Are you beginning to like him?
Why no.
Things haven't been the same between you and me Felice.
Not since you met him,
I owe him my life.
But I am not going to let him come between us.
Why Bobby!
I never realized that you felt that way about me.
Do you have your map, young man?
Better not take any chances.
That LaRocque crowd is not giving up that easily.
We will be watching for them.
I am keeping my eye on them too.
Getting too many of them to be comfortable.
I have to keep watch on them..
Good-bye Mr. Newsome.
Take care of yourself. Well good luck!
Thank you.
Bobby, its not same without you.
Good-bye.
Goodbye, Felice.
Goodbye, Rod.
Goodbye Bobby.
Goodbye, Felice.
Well, what you find out?
Oh, he don't answer any questions.
I cant find out nothing from him about the map.
And this morning they start down the river.
It is too late.
No, I do not think it is yet too late.
I have another idea.
Well?
They leave this morning.
Yeah, I know. But what you found out at the mountain police post?
I found out plenty.
They are wanted men.
A mountain patrol left fort Minekati this morning to find them.
That is bad. If the police get them, we loose the map.
We must beat the police.
A mounty!
Get away from that gun.
You are under arrest.
Hit the trail, you two.
We are heading for Kennegamy House.
Not that way, this way.
I thought the Kennegamy House was south west of here.
I said we are heading this way.
So it is your little game, is it?
Pretty clever, eh!
Almost as clever, the way you got Felice.
I should kill you for that.
Get the map!
Tie them up, put them in there.
Line up against that wall.
So you are the real Mounty!
I thought that other guy was a fake.
See we go up the Way Sugar to the Big Mackey.
Come... we go!
We got to get out of here.
LaRouque must be way ahead of us.
- Yeah! With our map.
- That's where you are wrong.
I left the real one on my boot.
You are not turning him loose, are you?
He is the law!
I am not going to live him here to die.
You can do what you want. But if you turn me loose I will make arrest.
Don't be crazy Rod.
You turn him loose and we don't have a chance.
He will have every man on the fort trailing us.
Listen, we may be your prisoners, but you are coming along with us.
Till we find out what this map leads us into.
That's white peak al right, and according to the map, it is right below us.
Here it is.
There must be a small fortune in there.
What's this?
By Jove it looks like Felice!
Why Bobby, is Felice John Bali's daughter?
You knew it all the time, why didn't you tell me?
I knew, if you find out, you will take here with you and I loose her.
I know now, that she doesn't care for me.
Well, we better get started.
LaRocque will know by now that he has been send into a wild goose chase.
And nothing will stop him.
It is not here.
We have been tricked.
We go back to the cabin.
Hey look!
Maybe we will find them in the creek.
Look, there they go.
Keep rowing, Bobby!
Oh, look!
We got to stop it, the fall is just below there.
Not good Bobby.
We have got to get him back to Wabinosh House.
Three time they fooled us.
But no more.
You will bring all the men here.
This time we will fool them.
We will attack Wabinosh House for the gold and the furs.
And they will find the ammunitions all gone.
Ah, Mecogui!
What did you find out?
20, 30 men hold big pow wow with LaRocque.
Him come here quick.
They probably intend to attack.
Thanks Mecogui,
I will get guns and ammunition ready.
Come on Bobby!
Wait!
There is a mounted police force at fort Mippigon... and I am deputizing you to and get there.
I will get them Ryan.
Mr. Newsome, these are empty!
Empty?
Benoit, to blame for this.
We cannot hold them forever.
Bryan intended that we get help from Fort Mippigon.
Going after them.
Hold up them as long as you can.
LaRocque gang is attacking Wabinosh House.
I have only three men here, but we are deputizing every men in the settlement.
Call assembly.
Everyone is ready?
We go!
Someone must have tipped them off.
No matter, but they cannot hold for long.
You lead them to attack while I go for Marie.
Oui, beau.
- Good! Everything there!
- Yes, most of it.
Wait I will get the rest.
Not so fast, Marie!
Here they come!
Take cover, quick!
Well, Ryan, we are ready to go back anytime you are.
That wont be necessary.
The sergeant told me, the guy that Bobby had the fight, didn't die after all.
When he recovered consciousness he exonerated Bobby from shooting.
And you boys are free.

Hey General, want a ride?
Suck jerk naïve!
That's a breach of contract,
A breach of visual contract, moron!
They've no respect for their Country or their flag, or medals or anybody!
I'm gonna put you on report, that's what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna put you on report with the Department of Transportation.
Hello! Hello!
Department of Transportation? Hello!
Sunspots!
Is there anything more beautiful?
I'm sitting next to her.
I love you.
- A little music?
- Fine.
- That's terrible.
- You've no taste.
This wing... I'll look like a mess.
- You look fine.
- No!
- Will you leave that alone?
- No, leave it!
- Oh, come on.
- Ah!
Wow.
It's nice to be in the Country.
City streets got bums on every corner, pushin', shovin', hustlin'...
There's no competition out there.
We should do this more often.
- Get lost?
- We're not lost.
Why is it a man will never admit he's lost?
We passed half a dozen stations and you wouldn't pull to one of them for directions.
But what does the map say?
The map isn't saying anything.
Wait a minute.
The cabin's a mile south of Steepston?
Yeah, that's what Lucas said.
You won't believe this.
We're almost there!
- The cabin should be over...
- Just around the corner, yeah, I know.
Go on.
Let's walk.
It's beautiful.
How long has your friend lived here?
Lucas? About... no long.
Well, which for you could mean half a century.
It’s more like 12 years.
After all that time, why does he suddenly want to see you?
I don't know... he...
He said something was worrying him.
Mac!
Mac!
He's dead.
Your friend?
How can you be so sure?
I just know.
What would we have here?
What you do, boy?
Oh no...
I didn't have nothing to do with this.
Body on floor...
You standing over him with a sword in hand...
Looks like your guilty as hell to me, boy.
You all right, son?
- What's your name?
- Leo.
Leo Atkins.
I have never seen you before.
You from around here?
No. I'm from...
I'm from nowhere in particular.
I'm real pleased to meet you, Leo.
Let me tell you where you're going.
You're gonna ride the lightning.
You killed a man.
And you're gonna fry.
- Sorry Mac.
- Are we bored?
No, we're not bored.
Actually, I was looking at this book of drawings, Da Vinci.
This dude was making flying machines when you were in diapers.
The thing is, if he can design gliders and stuff, why didn't he get our butts airborne back then?
'Cause he was hired to make gunpowder, instead.
- You finished those invoices yet?
- Ah... no.
No? Why not?
- I've been busy.
- Yeah, you being busy?
Yeah! I've been busy!
You know, I thing you got a little bit too much time on your hands.
- You need to spend a little time in jail.
- Jail! Why? For... assault with a paper airplane?
For littering your office? What!
- I'll tell you on the way to Steepston.
- Steepston?
That's a place that doesn't even have crosswalks.
- Why would we want to go to Steepston?
- What's this about Steepston?
- Because you're driving.
- The T-Bird?
- Bring it around the front, would you?
- Good, I'll get my jacket.
I need to talk to the guy they're holding for murdering Lucas.
Ok, I'll close up the shop and I'll come with you.
No, I need to do this on my own.
But you are taking Richie...
Well, I need him for something.
I know why you don't want me there.
You're afraid that what happened to Lucas could happen to you.
That never crossed my mind.
- Then, stay here!
- Tessa... they may have the wrong man.
I can't let him just... stew in jail.
I'll be back.
Smile!
- Promise?
- Scout's honor. Here.
The police blotter mentioned a report of a... just tell me if I got this all wrong... a sword fight on these premises?
This is Chinese.
You got it wrong.
So, what did happen?
We caught a young burglar.
The boy, who has a vivid imagination... was trying to steal a sword.
- No sword fight.
- No.
You've heard about the headless body they found up North?
Of course, who hasn't?
I just thought there might be a connection.
Why?
Because the victim had a big sword next to his body when they found him.
Sounds like a great story.
Good luck with it.
Yeah, well, thanks.
I guess you know a lot about swords.
You're so good at fencing.
I might have to come back for your expert opinion.
My expert's opinion is that you're wasting your time.
Yeah? Well, thanks.
I'm sure with your help, this will be a dynamite story.
I'm Sergeant Powell.
I talked to you this morning.
Sergeant Powell,
I'm Howard Crowley.
Come on in.
So, our little horror story brought you here.
Coffee?
Yeah, we got one of those ourselves:
We got a headless body on a city bridge a while back.
I know that, Sergeant.
We do get TV reception, even way up here.
Sorry.
I was going to call you anyway to compare notes.
We got no suspects, no witnesses.
Ours was done with a very sharp instrument.
So it probably wasn't an ax, or a chainsaw or...
What it was, probably, was a sword, right?
You're guessing or you've got something?
We've got a sword.
I'd run it into our lab to check the theory... if we had a lab.
Planned to send it to the county seat this afternoon.
I'd be happy to help with the interrogation if you're interested.
I think that can be arranged.
I suppose you like to see the crime scene first.
If I could.
Who was the victim?
A man named Desiree,
Lucas Desiree.
- He kept pretty much to himself.
- French?
Old southern stock.
Funny, him coming all the way up here to live.
His kinfolk probably owned a lot of your kinfolk... once upon a time.
So we like go to cabin sift through the place for clues the police missed?
No, they probably didn't miss anything.
I still don't get what would posses Lucas to move out in the middle of nowhere.
He just wanted get away, be on his own.
Like you did?
Out in the country, you can't take your mistress into the woods... for a quickie without twenty people knowing about it.
Lucas was very careful.
He didn't advertise his whereabouts.
And you don't think it's this bum that the papers are talking about, who did it?
Maybe. Maybe not.
I need to get close enough to be sure.
Wait a minute, Sherlock... are you trying to tell me there is a loose Immortal cruising around here... chopping off people's heads... in this vicinity, where you and I are going?
Possibly. We'll find out.
Oh, man!
You're trying my patience, Leo.
You talk but you don't say anything.
- I'm trying.
- Tell me again.
I don't know nothing I didn't know five minutes ago.
You do that pretty well, Leo.
"Crazy old Leo, wouldn't harm a flea"
That's what that man in the cabin thought.
Then you took off his head!
I never took no heads!
Oh, I knew a guy who took heads.
He put it on the end of his bayonet.
Yeah, you knew our guy.
And I bet you knew him real well.
Old habits die hard, don't they Leo?
You think you're back in Nam, collecting trophies off the VC!?
Is that what we got going here?
It's okay, Leo.
You can tell me.
See, I was there too.
I understand.
- You were there?
- Bet your ass.
- Two tours. Airborne. What about you?
- Dog soldier.
I hate the jungle. Snakes.
I hate snakes.
And tunnels, I hate tunnels.
What about cabins, Leo. You like cabins?
Cabins?
You were there, Leo.
In the cabin, with the sword.
Oh, yeah, I was.
- I remember that.
- Yeah, but not everything!
You see, that's why we're here, Leo.
We're trying to help you remember!
Oh yeah, 'cause you were there: in Nam.
Yes, and that's what you thought too, didn't you?
You were out there on patrol, weren't you, Leo?
- That's right.
- And you came to the cabin.
- Cabin?
- And you went inside with the sword.
- I don't remember no swords in Nam.
- But you just said you did!
Hey look, you got to keep it straight, Leo!
I'm trying to help you here!
You're out there on patrol.
You had your sword.
And all of the sudden he was there.
Charlie, the VC.
Yeah, I could smell him.
He was that close.
And you were scared.
Peeing in my pants.
He was so close, I could reach out and touch him in the darkness!
And you were so scared, you took your sword and you swung away.
You killed him.
It was "him or you".
I know how it is, Leo.
That's right. Him or me!
Him or me.
Him or me.
Him or me.
Him or me!
That's right. Him or me.
Yeah, him or me!
Yeah!
I don't see a stop light.
I don't even see a stop sign.
Maybe that's why Lucas came here.
To do what?
Play bingo and pitch horse shoes?
To live.
To not turn every corner expecting to meet out destiny.
Sounds like a simple thing to do.
To love, hate, drink and dream... about going someplace else.
Someplace better.
We are a little philosophical today, Mac?
Lucas just wanted to get away, try to retire for the Game.
Like you, before the Gathering.
That's what this is all about, isn't it?
One of your guys is out head-hunting. He finds Lucas...
So you come out here hoping this same guy comes looking for you, am I right?
Maybe.
- Why do you owe good old Lucas, anyway?
- It's a long story.
Now you know what to do, go and do it.
I could smell him.
I could hear him breathing.
And the sergeant said:
"Leo, take the point!"
And I took it.
Down on my belly like a damn snake... until I ran right into Charlie!
I couldn't see him in the dark!
But I tried to tell him...
"Don't do this. Slip away, man!"
"We're both gonna die today!"
But he shot me!
He shot me here on my face!
Leo, come back, man.
Come back!
¡And then everybody was there!
¡Sergeant, Jerry and Al!
They were firing tracers, like the fourth of July, like a fountain of fire, like a helo!
And then... then... and then the chopter came, and it lifted me out.
I saw it all.
I though I was asleep.
Later... later... they told me that a bullet went in my brain and made me crazy.
But that ain't so.
I saw it all.
I know what happened.
I so do you. Cause you were there.
- Take it easy...
- You told me you were there!
Take it easy now, soldier.
Take it slow.
Yes, sir.
Like a...
Like a fiery fountain on the Fourth of July, you know?
Ok, Leo. Sit here.
It's not him.
Come on, I could've been in New Mexico in fact by now.
Are you doin' what I think you're doing?
Hi Officer... doing what?
Give me that.
Down here.
This man needs water!
- Hush up, spy!
- He's dying of thirst!
He'll die of more than that if you don't hush up.
Soldier! At ease!
What seems to be the problem here, corporal?
This'n there Captain, nobody but a troublemaker and low down abolitionist.
Came in and stole folks niggers right off the plantations.
They caught him without a uniform behind our lines.
They's gonna hang him today.
He's wearing a uniform now.
And he will be treated with respect.
Give these men water, and rations.
- But the colonel, he said...
- Now, soldier!
Yes, sir!
By whose orders, sir?
Captain Lucas Desiree.
- I've been here for an hour.
- Reflecting on your sins?
Right, give me out here!
Come on Ryan, I'll process you out.
Leo.
You are my lawyer?
You don't look like no damn lawyer.
I'm a friend of the man they say you murdered.
I have murdered nobody.
When I came upon him on the cabin he was already hacked to pieces!
Like a broken toy soldier.
- Did you see anyone else?
- No.
Only the lightning.
The lightning of his terrible...!
Shut up!
Anything else?
The sword.
Looked like something from "Gone with the Wind".
- I'm gonna get you out of here, Leo.
- You and what Army?
Just trust me.
You're a hoot, friend.
Last person said that to me stole my shoes while I was asleep.
- Time before that...
- Hey, you!
- I'll be seeing you, Leo.
- I won't bet on that.
You are a reporter, right?
That "stolen car bull" was just so you could talk to our prisoner.
No, I'm a friend of Lucas Desiree's.
Was anyone else in town asking about him before his death?
I think we would have noticed.
Would have been hard not to.
Or maybe a stranger passing through.
Only stranger passing through was the one we caught.
You caught him?
Nope. Sheriff Crowley.
Aha.
How?
What do you mean, how?
- He didn't just passed by Lucas' place?
- Never said he did.
Fact is, half a dozen folks who live up in the Valley... saw some kind of lightning or electrical explosion or something about the same time.
- And that brought the Sheriff?
- Yeah.
Around these parts we don't get too much lightning in a clear blue sky.
What do they think caused it?
Electrical Company can't say for sure.
Some kind of surge in a transformer, maybe.
Anyway, like you said that's probably what brought the sheriff.
You weren't with him.
You are a reporter.
Why don't you just say so, like everyone else?
- Somebody else was asking questions?
- Yes.
But she was a lot prettier than you.
SAVE THE LOGGERS.
SHOOT AN ENVIRONMENTALIST.
So you found out for sure that old Leo isn't an Immortal.
What do you guys got, anyway?
A secret handshake?
- A tattoo.
- Really? Where?
We know how to handle some psycho killer up here.
- How's that, Bob?
- Well, I'll tell you what we wouldn't do.
We wouldn't like some environmentalist sensitive public defender... get him off on an insanity plea because he had too much sugar in his diet.
Could I get an orange juice and a Coke, please?
- Yeah.
- Isn’t that right, friend?
You look like you would know.
You look like you've got too much time on your hands.
You know what I bet we got here...
I bet we got another bird watcher.
Another Spotted Owl lover come up here to save the environment.
Put a lot of good men outta work.
Give it a rest.
I'll tell you something: You know, one of us will be happy to hire out as a guide.
We'll take you right back into the forest right to them damned spotted owls,
Won't be boys?
Yeah.
Somebody starts playing a banjo,
I'm outta here.
What's that?
It's a... nice hat.
My favorite team.
What do you want, tourist?
Just something to eat.
I'm sorry if the mill closed, or the wells dried up, or the grasshoppers ate your crop or your life isn't what you hoped it to be.
But I'm a friend of Lucas Desiree's and we're just here to find out how he died.
Now, don't you feel even more stupid than usual, Bob?
What the hell are you lookin' at?
See you, Bob.
We're all real sorry about what happened, honey.
Doesn't make a bit of sense.
Everybody liked him.
He kept to himself and was polite to a fault.
You knew him?
Oh no, nobody really knew him.
He came in here for food and supplies.
He was a real gentleman.
Yes, he was.
Don't you ever get hungry?
Thanks. What's the special?
Nothing's ever special here.
Try the meat loaf.
No, I'll try number four.
And I would like the... cheeseburger, but with processed cheese and sweet pickles on the side.
Tomato, lettuce, onion, ketchup, mustard...
Look, how many ways can I say "No Comment" before I bore you, Ms. McFarland?
Look, no microphone, no hidden camera.
Just on background, sergeant.
Look, this is the early stage of our investigation and we...
Aha! So you're investigating the beheading in the city a while back.
I mean, why else would you come clear up to the boonies?
Steepston isn't the boonies,
Ms. McFarland.
It's the sticks... right before the boonies.
- Any leads on the suspect?
- No...
...comment, I know. And I understand and
I appreciate your need for discretion.
So, if everything I've just suggested is true just say "no comment". I'll understand.
Look, I may be taking a suspect back with me for a psychiatric evaluation.
Check back then,
I'll give you whatever I can.
You're on my Christmas list, Powell.
Isn't that nice?
...extra mayo and not that light stuff.
Only the real stuff. I you got only the light stuff, forget about it.
And I would like that well-done with... onions rings and French fries on the side.
You know something? I'm gonna spurt, actually. Make that a double.
Salad and cheeseburger.
- He'd just know that's what I want, right?
- Oh, yeah.
Did he have any friends here in Steepston?
He got along with the old sheriff real good.
Used to play chess every...
Friday night right over that table.
Really?
With Sheriff Crowley?
Oh no, old Nate Perkins.
He retired and moved to Florida a few years back.
Since then, Lucas kept pretty much to himself. Hardly ever saw him.
I guess Sheriff Crowley wasn't much for chess.
Who knows. There's another one who keeps to himself.
Get's along well enough with the likes of LeMoyne, but he's a loner.
Well respected though.
Nobody messes with the sheriff.
Not even Lucas?
Lucas? I don't think I ever saw the two of them together in the same room.
I got the feeling they wanted it that way.
I still don't understand why you changed your mind. I though you wanted help.
I naturally assumed that a big city force... would do a better job conducting an interrogation.
You fell for his "crazy Leo" act like a catfish to a stinkbait.
Let's let a psychiatrist decide that.
In my professional opinion,
Leo didn't behead anybody.
And our lab found no trace of the victim's blood, not even microscopic particles on the sword you recovered from the cabin.
Maybe there was another weapon.
You said you showed up on the scene moments later.
What'd Leo do with the other sword, swallow it?
Now look, he is what he says he is:
A guy who staggered into the wrong place at the wrong time.
I'm afraid that won't wash with the good people of Steepston County.
I've got a valid psychiatric warrant for him.
You tell the good people of Steepston it's out of your jurisdiction.
Not until you're over the County line.
You know what route to take, ah?
Look, I don't need his help.
He's gonna show you a back way out of the county.
I don't need any trouble on my watch.
- Okay, let's go.
- You're not taking your car?
Not, I think I'll ride with Leo.
See, I'm such a city fella, I might just get lost on these back roads.
I'll send somebody back for my car.
You do that.
No bother at all.
Diner? Speak up.
Who?
Tommy Riley, it's for you.
- Who is it?
- I don't know.
He mumbled so bad
I couldn't understand him.
Hello?
- So, you ok?
- Yup, thanks.
Tommy, you intend to pay for these?
Put it on my tab.
Yeah, yeah.
Put it on the tab.
By the way, they're taking the guy they say killed your friend... down south for a psychiatric evaluation.
Sounds fair, Gwenn.
Yeah, if somebody doesn't hang him first.
I'm Duncan MacLeod, of the clan MacLeod.
Thanks.
Good thing they buried you way out here.
Not too crowded.
If I hadn't happened by today, you could have stayed under there for quite a spell.
Some would think this was a good time to take my head, Lucas.
Some would, I expect.
It was hard hanging you, even knowing what I knew.
- The others seemed to enjoy it.
- You stole their slaves.
You're destroying their way of life.
Revenge is all they have left.
You follow that road North to your lines.
I just might follow it myself, one day.
You're on the wrong side, you know that, Lucas.
Oh, we just get attached to the people, don't we?
Lot of good folks down here.
Friends.
Loyalty is a real funny thing.
Probably causes as much harm as does good.
Yes sir...
I think I'll up and follow that road North one day.
I'll look forward to that.
Be dark soon.
You'd best be going now.
So, he says: shut up, they're coming closer!
Easy boys.
- I don't believe we've met.
- I know who you are.
If you're here for the hunting, the season's just opened.
He claims to be a friend of Lucas Desiree, Sheriff.
- Is that a fact?
- That's a fact.
We heard that big city detective is taking the bum back with him.
Wish I could tell you different, Bob.
City folks just don't see things as clear as you and I.
Makes a man lose hope.
To an outsider it might seem like you want these men to do something about it.
Do? Have I asked you boys to do anything?
I'm just informing the most concern citizens.
We do appreciate that, Sheriff.
We just might voice our concern.
That's very civic minded of you.
Let's go, boys.
Well, got to run.
I suppose I'll be seeing you again.
Your friend Lucas died on his knees begging for his life.
We'll see how you do.
- Looks like we missed them.
- What do we do now?
I though we were jamming.
Nobody's told them Leo is gone.
So they got a bad tip.
Is she your type?
- Definitely.
- Good.
- Can I help you with something?
- No, no, no.
Just thought you might be here to interview that bum, Leo Atkins.
- Yes, so...
- I don't know...
He might not make it out of Steepston County.
You got a police scanner, right?
- Let's go find 'em.
- Let's go.
What's this?
Looks like somebody broke down.
Hey, don't go out there.
Hey, around these parts we like try and help out.
Struthers, get back in here!
That's enough!
We don't want to hurt you, officer. Just give us the psycho and we'll be on our way.
That's not going to happen.
Get back in your trucks and go.
Now!
You're not in the big city now, detective.
What're you gonna do, call for backup?
Now, this is the last time
I'm gonna ask nice.
You did your job. Now give him up.
Come on, all we want is the guy.
We'll let you go.
Just give him to us, right?
Is this a breaking story, or what?
- Roll tape, Frank.
- You looking to die, friend.
Put that camera down!
I said put it down!
Macleod.
Go ahead, shoot him.
Shoot her, shoot the boy, the officer or me. That's your idea of justice, isn't it?
Isn't it?
Go home!
All of you!
Crawl back under the rocks you came from.
It's over!
Let's go, boys.
And take this disgrace to the badge with you!
What in the hell are you doing here?
I think some people want to talk to you.
...here with Sergeant Powell, who has just stood off a mob... of masked men intent on taking the law into their own hands.
You've a statement,
Sergeant Powell?
Later.
Hey, hey. Hey. You owe me, Powell.
Or didn't you notice?
I suspect collusion by the local authorities... in the attempted abduction of Leo Atkins.
They clearly made an attempt to violate due process... and the suspects civil rights.
I'll be asking the FBI to look into this.
Thank you, Sergeant Powell.
You really were there.
You were there.
Going home, Leo.
The other hero of this amazing encounter... is a mysterious man...
- Where the hell is he?
- I don't know.
You couldn't let him live in peace.
That's all he wanted.
Wasn't very ambitious, was he?
Why Leo?
People in a small town like to talk.
If they don't get a fix on who did what, they keep picking at it like a scab.
Eventually, they would have figured it out.
People aren't as dumb as we wish they were.
I was starting to like it here.
Now I'll have to move on.
But you're staying here.
I guess one of us is.
In the future...
I'll remember to leave your friends in peace.
What future?
I guess I've got all I need for now.
- You might get called as a witness.
- I'm sure.
Did they ever find that sheriff?
Disappeared off the face of the Earth.
- The FBI will find him.
- What about Leo?
He's out in the car.
I'm taking him to the Bus station.
Excuse me,
I don't mean to bother you folks, but I seen the sign out front,
I was wondering if you bought old medals and such.
I'm a little short.
- That's yours?
- That's right.
I figure I can sell it if I want to.
Well, I don't think
I can buy it from you, Leo.
But I might be able to... lend you something against it until you come back this way.
Deal.
This antique business is a going concern.
I should've got rid of that long time ago.
Don't do not good to hang on to the past.
More that one day in a man's lifetime.
Well, I got a bus to catch.
I'll give you a ride to the Station.
- Take care, Leo
- Bye.
Bye, Leo.
Thank you.
You think they're going to find the sheriff?
Eventually.
What about Lucas?
I took care of him.
SubXpacio, TusSeries & Proy_Babylon.
{3166}{3233}- Mr. Dragore, please.|- Oh, him.
{4143}{4175}No sound, please.
{4186}{4234}After two years, I find you.
{4259}{4302}I want the Eternal Light.
{4320}{4357}You've found me too late.
{4369}{4404}It's no longer mine.
{4550}{4637}I can kill with this from the end of the room.|No lies, please.
{4670}{4715}You cannot kill in England, Mahmoud.
{4728}{4798}They get their murderers here|and hang them.
{4825}{4860}I have not come alone.
{4862}{4905}If I hang, there are others.
{4916}{5007}The Eternal Light goes back|to the tomb from which you stole it.
{5010}{5090}- But I tell you, I have not got it.|- Please, I am not a child.
{5150}{5203}- I sold it.|- To whom did you sell it?
{5240}{5273}To Professor Morlant.
{5321}{5358}That robber of the dead?
{5415}{5440}Has he sold it?
{5442}{5487}- He did not buy it to sell.|- What then?
{5490}{5564}- Like you, Mahmoud, he believes.|- Believes?
{5573}{5673}He believes that the Eternal Light|will open for him the gates of paradise?
{5675}{5750}Even so,|he gave the best part of his fortune for it.
{5762}{5837}And, very soon,|he will know whether or not he was right.
{5842}{5873}What do you mean?
{5890}{5953}Professor Morlant is dying.
{6022}{6080}Then you think it will be buried with him?
{6084}{6115}I'm sure of it.
{6129}{6169}We have only got to wait...
{6174}{6205}until he is dead.
{6462}{6492}Anubis...
{6602}{6637}Opener of the way.
{7462}{7489}What's that?
{7704}{7745}- What is it?|- Good evening.
{7757}{7796}I stay in the neighborhood...
{7798}{7881}and, hearing of your master's illness,|I took the liberty of calling.
{7883}{7914}How is he tonight?
{7917}{7958}He'll never see the morning.
{7963}{8029}- He hasn't asked for anyone of my cloth?|- Nor will he.
{8032}{8109}He's set in his ways,|and they are the ways of the heathen.
{8111}{8153}I know he won't see the rector...
{8156}{8241}but though I'm a stranger,|I don't like to leave a man to die like that.
{8243}{8311}He'll die in his own fashion, as he has lived.
{8314}{8383}- Still, sometimes at the end...|- Not with him.
{8386}{8485}He's stubborn and unbending|and will be so at the throne itself.
{8528}{8571}I suppose I can be of no use then.
{8574}{8612}No manner of use.
{8714}{8740}Good night.
{9033}{9069}He's asking for you.
{9139}{9185}Where can I find Mr. Broughton?
{9537}{9562}Who is it?
{9570}{9601}Come in or go out.
{9838}{9901}You'll have to go up soon|if you want to see him again.
{10005}{10045}Curious house, this.
{10056}{10086}Curious owner.
{10090}{10189}Yes, but I suppose a great Egyptologist|can't be expected to be like other people.
{10197}{10250}He'll be like a great many other people soon.
{10253}{10306}That's not a very sympathetic thing to say.
{10310}{10351}I'm not a sympathetic man.
{10374}{10400}Want a drink?
{10455}{10519}- That's across the hall, isn't it?|- I dare say.
{10530}{10554}Thanks.
{10875}{10941}"September 22nd...
{11349}{11385}"Daily journal."
{11746}{11801}"The Eternal Light...
{11822}{11870}"mine at last."
{12478}{12525}I want to see Laing.
{12575}{12605}I'm here.
{12704}{12742}Is the door shut?
{12751}{12778}It is.
{12812}{12861}- No listeners?|- None.
{12922}{12981}- The curtains?|- They are drawn.
{13050}{13083}Come nearer.
{13436}{13482}This man, Broughton...
{13528}{13556}Watch...
{13574}{13597}Broughton.
{13614}{13657}You were always suspicious.
{13670}{13728}Have you ever trusted a living soul?
{13741}{13776}Only fools.
{13843}{13881}I trust you.
{13903}{13972}Better to trust in the spirit than in the flesh.
{13982}{14032}I put my trust...
{14064}{14116}in my own gods.
{14174}{14199}And now...
{14230}{14261}when I am dead...
{14302}{14334}my funeral...
{14362}{14416}you will bury me at dusk...
{14444}{14500}in the clothes I told you.
{14536}{14601}You will place the figure of Anubis...
{14632}{14695}at the west of the inner chamber.
{14700}{14725}I will.
{14770}{14805}And on the night...
{14828}{14870}of the full moon...
{14938}{14981}at the first hour...
{15031}{15119}I will make my offering of the Eternal Light...
{15146}{15178}to Anubis...
{15216}{15272}opener of the ways.
{15364}{15432}If I have done well in his sight...
{15494}{15589}those fingers will close over the jewel...
{15683}{15790}and he will open to me|the gates of immortality.
{15815}{15905}The hand of a heathen image|will not come to life.
{15947}{15980}The bandage...
{16970}{16993}Look.
{17113}{17196}This is the Eternal Light.
{17270}{17329}It must rest in my hand.
{17375}{17461}A man will not find peace|who robs his heirs.
{17489}{17533}Bandage my hand.
{17565}{17599}The Eternal Light...
{17614}{17655}must lie with me...
{17673}{17702}in the tomb.
{17729}{17770}You're afraid of me?
{17798}{17841}I'm afraid for you.
{17859}{17906}If this should leave me...
{17949}{18023}then you'll have reason to fear...
{18080}{18122}for when the full moon...
{18137}{18197}strikes the door of my tomb...
{18228}{18266}I will come back.
{18302}{18331}You hear?
{18357}{18430}I will come back to kill.
{18497}{18595}Bandage my hand.
{19570}{19597}Doctor!
{20141}{20168}Window...
{20219}{20243}open...
{21031}{21060}It's all over.
{21158}{21213}Make out a certificate: Heart failure.
{21311}{21385}What was the idea|of bandaging his hand like that?
{21410}{21437}I cannot say.
{21452}{21498}He had many a queer fancy.
{21556}{21626}I'll be round in the morning|to sign the certificate.
{21762}{21856}I'll not be leaving my master's side|till his body is laid to rest.
{21886}{21910}No.
{24552}{24587}Where are you going?
{24598}{24672}To feed the lamp that is to burn inside.
{27042}{27066}Wait!
{27094}{27141}You're leaving the key inside.
{27169}{27232}That was another of his queer fancies.
{27713}{27760}When your master died, Laing...
{27770}{27854}I believe him to have been possessed|of a jewel of great value.
{27879}{27917}Do you know anything about it?
{27924}{27949}Nothing.
{27954}{28048}- I advise you to be very careful, Laing.|- I have a careful nature.
{28050}{28126}You may be putting yourself|perilously near dishonesty.
{28147}{28189}I've seen men nearer.
{28390}{28430}You may regret this, Laing.
{29223}{29294}I want you to stay here|and watch that man with the clubfoot.
{29298}{29341}But I'm not a detective.
{29344}{29407}One more word from you, Davis,|and you're out of work.
{29424}{29509}I have reason to believe that he has stolen|a valuable piece of property.
{29514}{29562}He may make an effort to get rid of it.
{29565}{29649}Watch him, and telephone me|at my office if he leaves the house.
{29662}{29693}Very good, sir.
{30603}{30626}"Harlon."
{30772}{30817}"Miss Betty Harlon...
{30831}{30898}"52 Blandford Street."
{32955}{32984}Carrier!
{33176}{33204}From Wrexham.
{33215}{33317}Ten shillings if you'll drive me to Yoxford|station in time to catch the 5:00 train.
{33319}{33399}I'll oblige you, guv'nor.|I was going straight back, as it was.
{34007}{34101}That's a very old carpet. I should be glad|if you will not kick it to pieces.
{34106}{34166}I'm sorry, but when I'm angry, I do kick.
{34187}{34249}- Would you like to explain that?|- Yes, I intend to.
{34290}{34371}By your own statement, Miss Harlon and I|are the sole heirs of Uncle.
{34374}{34428}We were not informed|of his death or his funeral.
{34430}{34497}Your uncle died|and was buried in a certain way...
{34500}{34543}according to his wishes, which...
{34554}{34585}Need I go on?
{34595}{34685}Almost his last words|were a threat to return from the dead.
{34709}{34770}- In my opinion, he was mad.|- Well, that may be so.
{34773}{34820}Miss Harlon and I|should have been consulted.
{34823}{34889}I understood that you and her|were not on speaking terms.
{34891}{34951}So what?|You expect quiet at a funeral, don't you?
{34956}{34997}Yes, I also expected my offer.
{34999}{35073}I'm very sorry,|but this means a good deal to both of us.
{35076}{35154}- I thought he was worth about £4,000 a year.|- He isn't now.
{35161}{35201}What do you mean by that?
{35211}{35258}He spent a good deal, you know.
{35282}{35342}It may surprise you to know|that, some time ago...
{35345}{35403}he drew a check for £75,000.
{35410}{35439}What for?
{35448}{35473}I don't know.
{35486}{35557}You were in charge of all his affairs,|and you don't know?
{35560}{35589}That's what I said.
{35614}{35688}And I advise you to look after|the tone of your voice.
{35690}{35790}I'm not sure I haven't more important things|to look after than the tone of my voice.
{35794}{35824}I don't follow you.
{35836}{35905}I'm going to run down|to Earlsvale House tomorrow morning.
{35919}{35942}Yes, why...
{35959}{36018}I don't think you realize...
{36035}{36082}the conditions that you'll find there.
{36085}{36147}- No, that's why I propose to go.|- You won't like it.
{36164}{36208}You'll be most uncomfortable.
{36211}{36254}You don't advise me to go?
{36262}{36325}I think you'll be making a very big mistake.
{36356}{36385}Then I'll go.
{36422}{36505}By the way, does Miss Harlon know|anything about this will business?
{36507}{36581}No doubt she will have received|a letter from me by now.
{36587}{36632}- Do you know Miss Harlon?|- No.
{36654}{36726}I plan to have the pleasure|of calling upon her this evening.
{36794}{36818}Hello.
{36830}{36873}It's you, Davis. Wait a minute.
{36883}{36951}I have a visitor here,|but I think he's just going.
{36963}{36998}Thank you very much.
{37005}{37079}If you're going to see Miss Harlon tonight,|I shall be there, too.
{37082}{37169}No doubt you will succeed|in making a painful interview intolerable.
{37190}{37221}Good afternoon.
{37234}{37299}Your manner must help|your practice a great deal.
{37462}{37490}Now, Davis.
{37736}{37801}Can you direct me|to Blandford Street, please?
{37804}{37885}Follow the tramlines close on a mile|and then turn right at the church.
{37887}{37928}I'm obliged to you.
{38598}{38628}Hello, Kaney.
{38938}{38983}It's good to get out of that fog.
{38986}{39045}My dear, a most exciting thing|has happened.
{39067}{39107}Don't let it happen again.
{39110}{39190}No, not that. That's a chestnut. It's this.
{39226}{39269}It looks like a solicitor's letter.
{39272}{39315}It's just been delivered by hand.
{39318}{39373}Oh, dear? What haven't we paid?
{39383}{39437}I wonder if I'm gonna get a shock or not.
{39464}{39507}Kaney, that is a silly game.
{39541}{39592}After all we've said about Uncle Henry...
{39594}{39631}what do you think he's done?
{39634}{39687}- Something nice, at last?|- He's dead.
{39709}{39753}My dear, I'm sorry.
{39759}{39808}And his solicitor wants to see me.
{39810}{39849}My dear, I'm glad.
{39863}{39910}He was awfully rich, wasn't he?
{39925}{39967}He may have left you a fortune.
{39970}{40037}If he has, I'll buy you a private cinema.
{40045}{40101}I say, when did this letter come?
{40113}{40153}A few minutes ago. Why?
{40156}{40237}He asks me to telephone him|if I could see him here at 6:00.
{40256}{40337}You don't want to miss the chance|of a fortune for the sake of tuppence.
{40340}{40408}- You'd better run out and do it now.|- You're right.
{42985}{43029}- Miss Harlon?|- Yes.
{43941}{43964}What happened?
{43967}{44025}Somebody attacked me,|and snatched my bag.
{44029}{44106}- Why, good Lord, it's Betty Harlon.|- Ralph Morlant.
{44123}{44182}You would go and get yourself|into some kind of mix-up.
{44185}{44243}- You would arrive when it's all over.|- Thank you.
{44246}{44290}- I'm going home.|- Wait a minute.
{44298}{44350}I was on my way to see you,|strictly on business.
{44353}{44405}You wouldn't be allowed in|for any other reason.
{44408}{44432}That's good.
{45277}{45302}Taxi!
{45342}{45409}Penninghame Garage,|as quickly as possible.
{46188}{46224}So you've brought him.
{46234}{46303}Dear Mr. Broughton,|we're delighted to see you.
{46306}{46384}No, it isn't Mr. Broughton.|It's my cousin, Ralph Morlant.
{46386}{46464}Dear Mr. Morlant, we're delighted to see you.
{46470}{46523}Wrong again. We don't like him very much.
{46529}{46591}Don't we? I didn't realize.
{46603}{46677}- Our two families are not on speaking terms.|- Oh, dear.
{46683}{46773}As far as I can make out, it was started|by my late uncle as a Christmas joke.
{46784}{46838}- Won't you sit down?|- Thank you.
{46860}{46927}But now he's dead. The trouble's all over.
{46941}{46991}I'm not sure it hasn't just begun.
{47002}{47042}Where's Mr. Broughton?
{47047}{47099}He won't come, because I didn't telephone.
{47102}{47149}I nearly got throttled instead.
{47169}{47249}There was a man with a limp.|He pushed a note into my hand.
{47251}{47292}I just put it in my bag...
{47295}{47344}when somebody snatched the whole affair.
{47348}{47379}What was in it?
{47382}{47447}"There's something of value at Earlsvale.
{47461}{47520}"Others are after it, so come."
{47527}{47629}And Broughton was doing everything|he knew to keep me away from there.
{47639}{47691}There's a fox in the cover somewhere.
{47702}{47726}Goodbye.
{47755}{47784}Why "goodbye"?
{47797}{47865}I'm going there right away.|I'll let you know what happens.
{47868}{47950}You're wrong. I'll let myself know.|If you go, I go, too.
{47959}{47996}You can't do that.
{47999}{48083}Alone in a house with a man|you're not even on speaking terms with.
{48086}{48157}Don't be so absurd.|It's not as if I even liked him.
{48168}{48228}If another woman was going, perhaps.
{48230}{48317}- I suppose you want to come, too?|- Obviously, it's my duty.
{48324}{48366}And suppose I object?
{48383}{48445}I'm not so broke I can't hire a car.
{48470}{48539}All right, you win,|but for goodness' sake, hurry.
{48862}{48932}Girls, just get in as best you can.|There you are.
{49064}{49112}- You first!|- No, you. Hurry up.
{49221}{49260}This is an unspeakable car.
{49262}{49319}- There's no room for my legs.|- All right.
{49550}{49629}- It looks as if I'll have to walk.|- You might do worse.
{49635}{49702}There's a grand moon. It's full.
{51836}{51886}I'll see if there's a name on this gate.
{52010}{52056}There's nothing to show this is the place.
{52058}{52135}But there aren't any other places,|and I'm frozen.
{52144}{52196}It's no use going to the wrong place.
{52198}{52270}Wait. Here's someone on a bike.|Hi there, cocky, wait a minute.
{52335}{52387}I'm sorry. I didn't see you were a parson.
{52390}{52421}That's all right.
{52457}{52489}- Any trouble?|- No.
{52500}{52565}We just want to get to Earlsvale House.
{52574}{52607}This is it.
{52618}{52673}As a matter of fact, I'm calling there myself.
{52676}{52748}- Did you know my uncle, Professor Morlant?|- Slightly.
{52757}{52829}Perhaps I ought to introduce myself.|My name's Nigel Hartley.
{52832}{52903}- I'm down at Raveley. The vicar's ill.|- How do you?
{52926}{52963}I'm Ralph Morlant...
{52982}{53018}and this is Miss Harlon.
{53021}{53045}We're the heirs...
{53048}{53115}Couldn't we have the rest|of the introduction indoors?
{53118}{53160}Of course. You must be cold.
{53206}{53269}It's straight down this drive.|You go along, I'll follow.
{53271}{53296}All right.
{53938}{53967}Here we are.
{54127}{54173}The car will be all right here.
{54201}{54237}I'll show you the way.
{55450}{55489}What a horrible house.
{55515}{55569}I wish I was back home in bed.
{55626}{55666}I can hear someone coming.
{55954}{56005}Don't stand about. Come inside.
{56808}{56848}We'll go into the library.
{57613}{57706}I may be old-fashioned, but I feel awkward|when I'm not introduced to people.
{57713}{57780}I'm sorry. I forgot you didn't know|your clients by sight.
{57822}{57874}- This is Miss Harlon.|- How do you do?
{57886}{57947}I was expecting|a telephone message from you.
{57954}{58000}I was on my way to call you up...
{58004}{58063}when the most extraordinary|thing happened.
{58126}{58155}This is Miss Kaney.
{58214}{58242}How do you do?
{58377}{58422}You're a surprise, Broughton.
{58442}{58510}I have a great deal of business|to clear up down here.
{58513}{58596}This house has needed a woman|for about 25 years.
{58647}{58689}Now I've blinded myself.
{58714}{58778}You haven't wasted much time|in getting here.
{58781}{58835}No, just a little too much, perhaps.
{58842}{58922}Whatever do you mean?|Really, you're the rudest man alive.
{58939}{58985}Oh, pretty pussy!
{59013}{59058}How horrible! It's stuffed.
{59074}{59129}I dare say, you know|your own business best...
{59131}{59183}but why you should want|to bring a parson in...
{59186}{59263}- A pure accident. We met at the gates...|- So you brought him in.
{59266}{59353}- I can stand a certain amount, but no more.|- Don't let's make a battle of it.
{59606}{59651}- You stay here in the car.|- No.
{59662}{59731}I shall be among the trees, watching.
{60041}{60101}You may say I have no right|to express this opinion...
{60104}{60178}but to my mind,|it's a scandalous and disgraceful burial...
{60181}{60235}which may have disastrous consequences.
{60238}{60306}It'd be very disastrous|if he came back, wouldn't it?
{60309}{60377}- I quite see Mr. Hartley's point.|- You make friends quickly.
{60379}{60457}- And enemies quicker.|- Need we have these childish squabbles?
{60475}{60533}We all know that dead men don't come back.
{60637}{60687}I wish I was back home in bed.
{60700}{60764}- Hadn't somebody better answer that?|- Certainly.
{60774}{60818}- It's your house.|- Very well.
{61010}{61045}I'm sorry to disturb you.
{61048}{61112}But I was an intimate friend|of Professor Morlant.
{61155}{61222}You'd better come in.|We seem to be giving a party.
{61264}{61293}Thank you.
{61585}{61639}My name is Aga Ben Dragore.
{61648}{61679}An Egyptian?
{61690}{61719}An Arab.
{61722}{61774}I don't remember having heard your name.
{61778}{61831}I did not flatter myself that you would...
{61834}{61916}but I knew Professor Morlant|some years ago in Egypt.
{62152}{62189}I heard of his death...
{62200}{62249}and of his burial in my own faith.
{62262}{62325}I hoped, as I'm leaving England tomorrow...
{62328}{62388}that I might be allowed to visit his tomb.
{62418}{62473}I must protest against anything of the sort.
{62475}{62549}Why shouldn't the poor man|look at his friend's tomb?
{62558}{62596}I don't mind him going.
{62608}{62689}I can't believe|that you'd willingly encourage paganism.
{62692}{62742}The Egyptians were not pagans, sir.
{62769}{62821}As no doubt you know, Miss...
{62838}{62865}Kaney.
{62891}{62974}I think you're all being very unkind|to Mr. Dragore.
{62984}{63085}I don't think you people realize quite|how far Morlant's queer ideas took him.
{63094}{63152}He believed that after his death,|at a certain hour...
{63154}{63238}the image of Anubis would come to life|in his tomb and receive his soul.
{63246}{63281}It's horrible.
{63298}{63343}Well, I can't see that it matters.
{63346}{63416}After all, if that sort of mumbo jumbo|gave him any comfort...
{63418}{63459}It matters a great deal.
{63462}{63544}If my suggestion is likely to hurt|anyone's feelings...
{63567}{63592}please forget it.
{63595}{63678}I think that's very sweet of you, Mr. Dragore.
{63698}{63758}Your sympathy is more than charming.
{63804}{63893}Well, what about a cup of coffee,|after your cold drive?
{63907}{63971}I dare say, we should find some|in the kitchen.
{63981}{64059}May I offer my services as pantry man?
{64084}{64126}Quite sweet of you.
{64206}{64241}Come, Mr. Dragore.
{64303}{64403}Her sheer speed! She'll not let him out|of her sight for a moment, now.
{64406}{64450}Perhaps that's just as well.
{64482}{64548}Come along, Betty,|how about making a fire in the library?
{64550}{64575}Yes.
{64595}{64653}I'm sorry there should be|this sort of atmosphere.
{64655}{64724}After all, we're only ships|that pass in the night.
{64739}{64793}Do you want a drink, or will you pass now?
{64814}{64853}Well, thank you very much.
{65033}{65062}There you are.
{65350}{65417}If you build it that way,|there won't be any draft.
{65422}{65506}It'll be the only place in this house|where there isn't one, then.
{65518}{65600}Don't you think you carry|those snappy retorts a trifle too far?
{65603}{65700}Since we met, I can't remember you|saying a kind word to anyone.
{65705}{65760}Perhaps you're right. I'm sorry.
{66002}{66034}Six cups.
{66051}{66087}That's just...
{66100}{66139}four too many.
{66212}{66253}Tell me about Egypt.
{66281}{66326}Have you ever seen a sheik?
{66371}{66399}I am one.
{66600}{66629}Thank you.
{66674}{66723}Then how should I address you?
{66751}{66829}I'm cutting sandwiches for a sheik.
{66855}{66895}I don't feel quite well.
{66907}{66939}Don't be alarmed.
{66950}{67013}We're not quite as uncivilized|as people think.
{67022}{67056}Don't say that.
{67096}{67149}Do you ride a white stallion?
{67157}{67183}Sometimes.
{67202}{67254}Down the path of the moon...
{67268}{67362}the noble animal,|plunging and frothing at the nostrils...
{67371}{67450}till it founders at your feet,|faithful unto death.
{67458}{67493}Well, not very often.
{67496}{67548}You see, it's rather too expensive.
{67566}{67645}I know it's not your fault.|We were taught to hate one another, but...
{67648}{67692}You don't think I hate you, do you?
{67694}{67749}I can't somehow feel I'm your dearest friend.
{67774}{67824}You never did have a great deal of sense.
{67826}{67859}That's nice.
{67920}{68009}Ralph, I have a woman's intuition|that you and I are up against things.
{68040}{68128}- I'm pretty sure we are.|- Well then, let's cut the quarrelling.
{68134}{68184}Shoulder to shoulder? All right.
{68210}{68234}Partners.
{68618}{68693}Well, what a wonderful night.|It's a full moon.
{69090}{69149}Scared of a dead man in his tomb?
{69178}{69210}Shame on yourself.
{69281}{69379}Are you a child, that your knees|should rattle at the talk of a madman?
{69467}{69517}Look your enemy in the face.
{69542}{69606}It's the fear of the big door has got you...
{69611}{69684}and will hold you fast till you stare it down.
{69850}{69889}Do dead men walk?
{69922}{70004}I'm not thinking a dead man|will cross my path tonight.
{74214}{74251}I was dreaming.
{74270}{74347}Now I will show you|how we make coffee in the desert...
{74351}{74388}underneath the stars.
{74426}{74481}You don't make it yourself, do you?
{74487}{74531}No, of course not.
{74549}{74592}A Circassian slave...
{74594}{74673}Iovely as sin, cooks it for us, kneeling.
{74687}{74756}- And if it is not to our liking...|- I know!
{74781}{74834}She's stripped to the waist...
{74854}{74938}and lashed for miles across the Sahara.
{74950}{75042}Where she is finally eaten by locusts,|and rightly.
{75078}{75181}Now, take this canister,|and do exactly as I tell you.
{75234}{75269}And if I fail?
{75278}{75341}The Yorkshire moors are just behind us.
{75426}{75462}Six spoonfuls.
{75500}{75525}One!
{75614}{75640}Two!
{75732}{75758}Three!
{75808}{75833}Four!
{75867}{75893}Five!
{76117}{76194}Get off, you! Get your arms away from me!
{76275}{76339}What's the matter with you? Are you mad?
{76502}{76578}What was the matter with him? Was it drink?
{76581}{76625}No. Terror!
{76646}{76681}Stark terror!
{76699}{76741}Then I've caught it.
{76758}{76786}You stay here.
{76803}{76837}I'll look after him.
{76851}{76936}If you must look after somebody,|why look further?
{76990}{77016}Come on, then.
{77161}{77228}Ralph! That limp! I'd swear to it anywhere.
{77607}{77637}That's the man.
{77758}{77840}- Did you give a note to this young...|- Get your things and get out of here!
{77843}{77895}The master, I've seen him!
{78135}{78192}- Who screamed?|- I did.
{78194}{78293}That's the last time I'll ever try|to make coffee in a strange house.
{78295}{78345}That man with the limp, who was he?
{78351}{78413}Laing, your uncle's servant.
{78432}{78473}Well, he seemed mad to me.
{78709}{78737}Yes...
{78751}{78788}and probably dangerous.
{78813}{78873}Go into the library. I'll have a word with him.
{78876}{78951}Yes, come along.|Mr. Broughton understands the man.
{79312}{79376}It would do no harm|to warn my man to stand by.
{79378}{79436}Your man? Is he a sheik, too?
{79439}{79524}No, he's a chauffeur.|He's outside now with my car.
{79640}{79691}You're not leaving us, are you?
{79737}{79781}My dear lady.
{80000}{80066}Not a very courageous person,|our foreign friend.
{80090}{80132}You think he's run away?
{80146}{80174}Absurd!
{80187}{80286}I'd like to see you riding your bicycle,|with a Circassian slave, lovely as sin...
{80289}{80323}across the handlebars.
{80329}{80400}- What on earth are you talking about?|- Listen, good people.
{80402}{80488}Don't you think we're allowing this thing|to get on our nerves?
{80492}{80569}Don't you think if we took a grip|on our self control...
{80572}{80620}Now, listen, good parson...
{80622}{80711}this is our show, and our nerves|are probably as good as the next man's...
{80714}{80769}so keep that sort of talk to your pulpit.
{80772}{80835}I have no wish to interfere|where I'm not wanted.
{80838}{80894}Then don't. This is not a Sunday school.
{81027}{81083}After that, I think I can say good night.
{81098}{81128}As you please.
{81254}{81308}I'm sorry I was offensive. Good night.
{81310}{81389}The tongue is an unruly member, is it not?
{81400}{81424}Yes.
{81650}{81692}I was tempted...
{81758}{81801}but I did not fall.
{82057}{82093}I did not fall.
{82114}{82190}The thing's safe, I swear it.
{82302}{82372}When you told me|you'd come back from the grave...
{82376}{82415}how could I believe you?
{82426}{82486}I never knew such things could be.
{83500}{83568}I have not got it!
{83583}{83639}The girl, she has it!
{83651}{83682}I swear it.
{84333}{84423}What on earth's the matter with you?|You look as if you've seen a ghost.
{84426}{84453}I have.
{84493}{84587}I saw Morlant as plainly as I see you.
{84627}{84671}I'm gonna mix myself a drink.
{84875}{84922}Betty, just a minute.
{84994}{85019}Well?
{85033}{85093}I think they're trying to scare us|out of this house.
{86712}{86768}There's no use blinding ourselves|to the facts.
{86770}{86819}There must be something big at stake.
{86822}{86882}Something that depends|on getting rid of us?
{86894}{86935}That's how it looks to me.
{86943}{86986}But what are we going to do?
{88810}{88836}Who's there?
{88988}{89052}- I'm going down to that tomb and find out...|- What does...
{89054}{89113}It's the only way to find out|what's going on here.
{89117}{89185}I don't want to be left here alone.|Can I come, too?
{89209}{89275}There's nothing wrong with your nerve.|Come on.
{89532}{89604}- I'll put on a pullover and thicker shoes.|- All right.
{89617}{89652}- Is this yours?|- Yes.
{89655}{89701}I'll keep an eye on Broughton.
{90045}{90149}You have every chance of seeing things|if you lower Scotch at that pace.
{94175}{94228}Mr. Dragore!
{94329}{94361}There you are.
{94377}{94445}Mr. Dragore, I'll come up to you.
{94543}{94582}Wait, I'll come down.
{94734}{94805}- What do you want?|- There was somebody in the library.
{94807}{94849}- Who?|- I don't know.
{94867}{94906}The door, it shut!
{94934}{94963}Don't scream.
{94982}{95024}That's what I need!
{95026}{95106}The command in your wonderful voice.
{95202}{95229}Come with me.
{95250}{95320}I think you've gone far enough|with your insinuations.
{95322}{95377}Yes, and I may go a great deal farther.
{95433}{95491}- What is it? What's the matter?|- I've seen him.
{95659}{95724}Now perhaps you'll believe what I told you.
{95730}{95768}Get me a glass of water!
{97257}{97323}Thanks. I wasn't hurt, only frightened.
{97359}{97422}Broughton, see if you can find Miss Kaney,|will you?
{97521}{97606}It's wonderful to be with a man|who isn't afraid.
{97609}{97637}I am afraid.
{97640}{97725}You, who have ridden bareback|over the desert...
{97738}{97821}If you don't stop chattering,|I am afraid I shall have a knife in my back.
{97824}{97881}When I'm with you, I have to talk.
{97885}{97940}It comes, like poetry.
{97961}{98003}Are you prepared to obey me?
{98014}{98047}In anything.
{98059}{98096}Then close your eyes...
{98110}{98170}and don't speak for 10 seconds.
{99257}{99325}- We all panic sometimes.|- I felt his hands on me.
{99327}{99397}- That's why I know it was no ghost.|- It was no ghost.
{99433}{99505}Look at the clock. It's nearing the hour.
{99516}{99565}I know where you'll find him now.
{99580}{99669}He's gone back to the tomb,|to his heathen gods.
{99720}{99760}You and I will follow him there.
{99762}{99789}Wait a minute.
{99802}{99880}- What's his doctor's telephone number?|- Yoxford, 72.
{101461}{101520}Look! The door's open, and there's a light.
{101529}{101593}I'll go no nearer.
{101665}{101706}I can see a shadow moving.
{101709}{101772}- I'll go no nearer.|- Well, then, go back.
{101833}{101870}What about it, Betty?
{101879}{101909}Do we go on?
{101930}{101961}Yes, of course.
{102001}{102040}Thought you'd say that.
{104755}{104781}Look!
{105084}{105161}Hartley! So you're not a parson.|Just a dirty crook.
{105283}{105335}You'd better get out of my way.
{105347}{105410}Your hand! So that's how it was done.
{105453}{105516}- I wouldn't come any nearer.|- I don't have to.
{105695}{105719}Look!
{105721}{105784}If you please. Thank you. Come on, now.
{107553}{107577}Door.
{107753}{107824}- It's too late. Are you badly hurt?|- No, it's nothing.
{107848}{107880}Come and sit down.
{107900}{107950}- Where's the key?|- He threw it away.
{108185}{108247}When I phoned the doctor,|I told him to bring the police.
{108249}{108288}They ought to find us somehow.
{108290}{108373}Even if they do come,|how can they break down that door?
{108481}{108515}They'll find a way.
{108623}{108652}I'll make a bandage.
{108877}{108943}The doctor in charge|didn't understand the case.
{108949}{109001}- I'm afraid of catalepsy.|- Meaning?
{109004}{109044}Morlant was buried alive.
{109071}{109150}Mr. Dragore, what were those shots?
{109159}{109217}- Out of my way.|- Where are the others?
{109224}{109254}Leave me alone.
{109791}{109844}I thought you might be leaving in a hurry...
{109846}{109913}with something in your pocket|that doesn't belong to you.
{109917}{109946}Hand it over.
{109981}{110004}You win.
{110251}{110300}That woman! There she is!
{110303}{110360}- Come now.|- Put down that gun, you fool.
{110362}{110402}I tell you, she's got it.
{110492}{110520}Come on, then!
{110745}{110770}Stop!
{110789}{110868}- Now, Miss Kaney, if you please.|- I don't think so.
{110870}{110900}You fool.
{110905}{110989}If either of you two horrible men|so much as move...
{110995}{111023}in it goes.
{111025}{111126}- You don't know the value of that jewel.|- I don't care for the value. It'll go.
{111161}{111212}And if you shoot, I'll go with it.
{111239}{111264}I mean it.
{111278}{111376}Down 30 feet, and about 60 feet of water...
{111426}{111468}and then Australia.
{111533}{111618}I can't see to tie this.|That light seems much lower.
{112048}{112126}Hartley! Quick, come on! Get up!|Get him out of here!
{112269}{112329}- The door!|- Shut!
{112371}{112453}The flames! They mustn't reach the door!
{112811}{112865}It's no good. You can't breathe in there.
{112932}{112961}The cartridge!
{113009}{113034}Here!
{113043}{113068}If only...
{113245}{113294}I've had enough of this, Miss Kaney.
{113300}{113357}Supposing I'm ready to shoot,|and take the risk?
{113359}{113428}You'll be taking a bigger risk than you think.
{113454}{113499}- I'll take that gun.|- Now, look here.
{113501}{113561}That'll do. Now what's the trouble?
{113567}{113625}This, they're after it.
{113633}{113693}All of them. It belongs...
{113759}{113795}I'll carry her to the house.
{114060}{114090}Get back!
{114095}{114128}Back in that corner!
How's that?
Gotta hand it to you, Rico.
The old bean's working all the time.
- What'll it be, gents?
- Spaghetti and coffee for two.
All right, sir.
What's that gotta do with the price of eggs?
Ah, plenty.
Diamond Pete Montana.
He don't have to waste his time on cheap gas stations.
He's somebody. He's in the big town doing things in a big way.
And look at us.
Just a couple of nobodies, nothing.
Is that what you want, Rico?
A party like that for you?
"Caesar Enrico Bandello.
Honored by his friends. "
I could do all the things that fella does and more.
Only I never got my chance.
And what's there to be afraid of?
When I get in a tight spot,
I shoot my way out of it. Why, sure.
Shoot first and argue aftervvards.
You know, this game ain't for guys that's soft.
Yeah, there's money in the big town, all right.
And the women. Good times, something doing all the time.
Exciting things, you know.
Gee.
The clothes I could wear.
And then I'd quit, Rico.
I'd go back to dancing, like I used to before I met you.
I don't know. I ain't made for this sort of thing.
Dancing
That's what I wanna do.
Dancing?
Women?
And where do they get you?
I don't want no dancing.
I'm figuring on making other people dance.
- Oh, I ain't forgetting about the money.
- Money's okay, but it ain't everything.
Be somebody. Look hard at a bunch of guys and know they'll do anything you tell them.
Have your own way or nothing.
Be somebody.
- You'll get there, Rico.
- Yeah.
- You'll show them.
- You know...
...this was our last stand in this burg. We're pulling out.
- Where are we going?
- East.
Where things break big.
So I beat it east, like I told you.
That's all there is to it.
I wanna run with your mob, if you'll let me. What do you say?
You won't be sorry for letting me in. I'll do anything you say. I ain't afraid of nothing.
You think you're a hard guy?
There's nothing soft about me.
Nothing yellow. I don't quit.
- You got an idea you're good, huh?
Give me a chance to show you.
- What do you know about me?
- Oh, I heard plenty.
How you run things this end of town.
About this here Club Palermo, how it's your front. I got told enough.
- I guess you're good with a rod too, huh?
- Quick with it and sure.
Well, that don't go around here.
That's old stuff. This ain't the sticks.
Yeah, I get you.
All right. You stick around.
But, remember, I'm the boss.
And I give all the orders.
And when we split, we split my way.
- And no squawks. You get me?
- Yeah, sure, Mr. Vettori.
- All right, come on in, meet the boys.
- Sure.
Oh, they're 100 percent, all right.
Every one of them.
There's Tony Passa. Can drive a car better than any mug in the town.
Otero. He's little, but he's the goods, all right.
Bat Carilla.
Killer Peppi.
Kid Bean.
And this one here, Scabby.
What a smart guy he is.
Boys.
Come on, Tony. Wake up.
I want you to meet a new guy what's gonna be with us.
This is, uh...
_Uh_
- Caesar Enrico Bandello.
Oh, Little Caesar, huh?
Yeah, sure.
Where did you get the new dancer, DeVoss?
Olga brought him around a few days ago.
Not bad.
- All right.
- I'll say he is.
Well, I got hold of a real dancer for a partner, didn't I, Mr. Devoss?
He's an elegant dancer.
We'll panic them after a few rehearsals.
Say, you're not trying to sell him to me, are you, Olga? Ha-ha-ha.
Well, young fella, I guess
100 a week ought to buy you.
That's more than I generally start with.
That's swell with me, even though it don't buy no limousines.
Gee, thanks, Mr. Devoss.
You'll never be sorry for this.
Come, Joey.
So it's you and me from now on.
Well, I'm glad.
And I'm not ashamed to tell you.
I guess you know by this time how I feel about you.
That's all right with you, isn't it?
Or have you got another girl?
A steady, I mean.
RAUGHS]
Hundreds of them, sure. Only...
Only, what's the difference?
This is gonna be real.
- We'll make it mean something.
- Yeah, Joey, let's.
Because I need somebody.
Somebody like you.
Awful bad.
- You believe me, Olga?
- I want to believe you.
What's that?
What you got there, Joe?
What are you doing with that?
Can't you forget you've seen it?
It won't make no difference.
Not between us, Olga.
Heh-heh, don't worry, baby.
It's just a little good-luck charm
I carry around with me.
Is that your racket?
Maybe.
I suppose I got no right to ask you, Joe.
But now...
Now that we got an understanding.
Couldn't you leave it?
No.
I suppose I haven't got the right.
What would be the good of you asking, kid?
Once in a gang...
- You know the rest.
- I don't want to know.
Only maybe...
Maybe it could be different this time.
If we try.
I've never seen the guy that could get away with it yet.
Black. Seven.
Sam Vettori is still waiting for you in your office.
All right, I guess I'll have to see him.
I wonder what he wants here.
Hey, Ritz.
You'd better stick with me.
I'll need you in there.
- That Sam Vettori's a no-good lug.
- You said it, boss.
Better let me go first.
Cut that.
Hello, Arnie.
Surprised to see me in your swell joint?
Maybe I won't be after you tell me what you want here.
Oh, I'll tell you, all right.
Diamond Pete asked me to come up.
He's coming up too.
- Pete Montana?
That's who.
Well, if Pete wants you here, it's got to be all right with me.
- Hello, Mr. Montana.
- Hello.
Hello.
- Hello, Arnie.
Hello, how are you?
- Hello, Vettori.
- Hello, boss.
Cigar?
Thanks.
Thanks, Arnie.
Sit down, boys.
I got something to tell you.
A message from the Big Boy.
Now, listen. Here's the lowdown.
- The Big Boy says-
- Just a minute, boss.
Hey, you.
Nobody asked you to be butting in here, did they?
- Screw, mug.
- You ain't giving me orders.
You're a fresh guy, huh?
- Take it easy, Rico.
You go out there and wait for me.
Jake with me, boss.
Now, listen, boys.
Watch this guy McClure...
...what's head of the new crime commission.
He's putting the screws on, and make no mistake about him.
Now, the Big Boy wants me to tell you guys...
...to put the chains on your gorillas for the next few months.
Because if any of them go too far, it'll be just too bad.
Ah, heh.
I've never seen nobody the Big Boy couldn't get to.
He can fix anything.
That's why he's the Big Boy.
This bird McClure will be pie for him.
- He'll twist him around his little finger.
- Don't kid yourself.
Nobody's squaring nothing with McClure.
Not even the Big Boy.
Small jobs, that's different.
We could spring guys for them.
Butshoofing?
No, sir.
It's guys like this torpedo of yours that cause all the trouble.
Who, Rico? Heh-heh.
He's all right. He's a little quick on the trigger, but that's because he's new.
Yeah? Well, it's us that'll swing for him...
...if he shoots at the wrong time.
Now, remember what I told you.
Come on. So long.
And you.
You take it easy with that cannon of yours.
Did you hear me?
Yes, Mr. Montana.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Good night.
Good night.
Do yourself a favor, will you, Rico?
Leave your gat home on the piano the next job you pull.
Yeah, park it next to your milk bottle.
Hey. Run your own mob, Arnie.
I'll take care of mine.
Yeah, I'll park it.
I don't need no cannon to take care of guys like you, Mr. Lorch.
Yeah, we gotta be careful.
Little Arnie's interested in this here nightclub.
- If it ever gets out who pulled the job-
- They'll never get wise to us.
They're careless, but they've never been tapped.
Yeah, but I don't like the whole business.
Neither do I, Sam. Honest, I don't.
I couldn't sleep last night.
I was up worried.
I don't want to take any chances. Not now the way they're closing down on us.
What's the matter, Tony, getting yellow?
No, but, jeez, none of us wanna hang, do we?
You'd like to quit, wouldn't you?
You'd like to run out on us.
- You're yellow, you dirty-
- Wait a minute, Rico.
Where do you get that yellow stuff?
You want to know who's yellow,
I'll tell you.
Joe Massara, your pal.
- That's why he didn't show tonight.
- He'll be here. Just because-
I know all about that stuff. I'm gonna give him 10 minutes more. Then we'll see.
Now, listen, Sam, Joe's all right.
He's the best front man in the world.
Why, he can go to a swell hotel and order a suite, a suite, and it's all right.
Without Joe, we can't pull the job, and you know it.
What's that paper?
It's this layout I've been figuring out with Scabby.
- What, this nightclub job?
- Yeah.
Well, let me see it.
And until I say different...
...nobody's gonna plan for this mob but me.
You get me?
He'll learn.
Now, come here, you guys.
Now, get this.
Hello, Joe.
Hello, Rico.
Come here.
I told you to be here at 8:30.
Oh, well, you see, I-
I was busy.
I was rehearsing, and...
- Oh, you know how it is.
- Yeah, I know how it is.
They've been saying it, only I didn't believe them.
They're crazy when they call you yellow.
Aw. Tell them they can go to-
Say, what's the big idea of the rush anyway?
It's a little job we need you for.
A little job at the Bronze Peacock.
What do you mean?
Are you trying to kid me or something?
How can I take the chance?
They're all my friends, they all know me.
That's why, they'll never suspect you.
Now, don't stall, Joe.
I ain't stalling.
You gotta get me out of this, Rico.
You gotta. I don't want to...
Well, don't you see,
I'm working steady now, and...
Can't a guy ever say he's through?
You're gonna be in on this, and you'll like it.
The time is to be sharp midnight on New Year's Eve.
I won't. I can't.
I can't, don't you see? I-
Well, gee, I-
- I'll be working New Year's Eve.
- Now, listen, Joe.
This is the joint where you're working.
And don't you be forgetting it, either.
Come on in.
Well, maybe it ain't so hot.
- Maybe we can't buck Little Arnie.
I can.
Ah, you're too good, that's what.
Hello, Joe. You were in a big hurry about getting here, weren't you?
- Maybe this kind of work ain't to your liking.
- Joe's all right. He's in with us.
Yeah, I'm in with you.
Well, let's see, now.
Here's the way I dope this thing out.
I, Sam Vettori, not you, Rico, or nobody else.
- That's plain, ain't it?
- Sure.
Only, who stands here?
You kind of forgot that, didn't you?
Hey, I'm boss on this job, not you.
Right here.
Smart guy, Rico.
He's got plenty of brains.
I tell you, I'm afraid, Otero. I'm afraid.
Ah, you're crazy. Rico's coming with us.
Come on now, buck up. Don't be scared.
And you, Joe.
You'll be in the lobby and give us the high sign...
...if everything's on the up and up.
You get me?
Yeah, and if we get in a jam, you'll have to take a chance with the rest of us.
Hey, quiet, quiet.
Holy Moses, it's Alvin McClure.
The crime commission buzzard.
Hey, Devoss. (Some here.
What is it, Arnie? What is it?
Bring McClure over here,
I want to buy him a lemonade.
- Not tonight, some other time.
- Go on. Do as you're told.
Go on, DeVoss, bring him here.
As you wish.
What can I order for you?
- Good evening, Mr. McClure.
- Good evening, DeVoss.
- Quite a party, eh?
- Thank you.
Delighted to have you with us, folks.
Heh-heh.
Mr. McClure, a Mr. Lorch, a financial backer of mine...
...would like to meet you.
- May I bring him over to your table?
- Lorch? Lorch?
- You mean the man they call Little Arnie?
- Yes, but-
- You say he's a financial backer of yours?
- Yes, but-
I didn't understand that a man of his type was connected with this place.
I'm sorry, DeVoss, but you might inform Mr. Lorch that we're leaving.
I came to this place under a misapprehension.
- Now, Mr. McClure-
- I'm sorry, folks...
...but we'll have to go somewhere else.
You like my hair this way, Joey?
Sure.
I used to wear it-
Where are you going?
- Just to get a package of cigarettes.
- Hurry back, darling, it's almost 12:00
...and I wanna be with you for New Year's.
I'll be back in a minute.
- What can I get you?
A Victor Noble.
Stay where you are.
Oh, help! Oh, God!
Open her up, Tony, this ain't no picnic.
What's the matter, Tony, losing your nerve?
Come on, let's go. Let's go, we gotta get out of here. Come on.
Happy New Year.
Why, Joe...
Joey.
What is it? What's the matter?
Nothing.
It's all right.
- The joint's been held up, that's all.
- Held up?
Theynn
- They shot McClure.
- Joe.
- Now you know.
- It was you.
- No. No, it's a lie! I-
- You shot McClure.
No, I didn't, I swear.
It wasn't me that shot him. It was-
I don't know who.
But it's our hips for this job, all right.
Maybe- Maybe everything will be all right, Joey.
Maybe he wasn't hurt badly.
But you're through with that bunch.
You don't belong, Joe.
You're not that kind.
You'll never go near them again.
Olga...
...you can't go back...
...on a gang.
Well, everything come off all right? Tell me.
Everything was all right.
Only I had to take care of a guy.
- Who was it?
- McClure.
McClure.
You shot McClure.
A million guys in this town, and you had to pick the crime commissioner.
What did I tell you, Rico?
Didn't I say to make it clean?
Didn't I say no gunplay?
Think I'm going to let a guy pull a gat on me?
Any more of these cracks, and this is my last job.
The head of the crime commission.
The Big Boy can't do us no good this trip.
They'll get us dead sure now.
- What am I gonna do?
- Why don't you go and give yourself up?
You're slipping, Sam.
And Tony, what about him?
Where is he?
Getting rid of the car.
Tony got nervous. He's like a big baby
What a fine pickle we're in.
You and that rod of yours.
Flaherty's downstairs, a couple of dicks with him
They're coming right up.
Stay where you are, all of you.
They won't know nothing unless they picked Tony up. Give them the shaft.
I'll be in here listening.
Happy New Year, boys.
Say, there's a lonesome touring car down the street.
I was wondering if you happened to know anything about it.
How should I know anything about it?
- Ain't it got license plates on it?
- Yes, but they're phony.
It was stolen on the north side tonight.
Oh, I got a good café business.
I don't know nothing about automobiles what's been stolen.
Well, you might if some of the bright young men around here...
...had anything to do with it, wouldn't you?
- Wasn't there anybody in it?
- Yes, one guy.
But not when we got there. He beat it.
But we got a good description of him, though.
I'm telling you,
I don't know nothing about it.
Well, come on, fellas.
As long as Vettori doesn't know anything about it.
Oh, say, have you heard the news, Vettori?
No, what?
Someone knocked off Alvin McClure over at the Bronze Peacock.
McClure? No, that's terrible.
Some guys are sure careless with the lead, all right.
What a tough break for Arnie.
It's gonna be a tough break for a lot of birds.
Well, so long.
Oh, I forgot to wish you fellas a merry Christmas.
Tony, I can't figure him.
The kid's a great driver.
- Oh, he must've lost his nerve.
- I'll take care of him.
- Let's see the color of that money.
- Just a minute, Sam.
I got my own ideas of a split.
And you can take it or leave it.
- We ain't begging you.
- Yeah, well, I bossed this job...
...and I'm gonna get my split.
How'd you boss this job?
By sitting here cheating at solitaire?
Well, that don't go no more, not with me. We're done.
- I've been taking orders from you too long.
- You'll keep on taking orders too...
- ... or you'll get out of here so fast...
- Maybe it won't be me that gets out.
No? Well, maybe the boys have got something to say about that.
What about it?
So that's it, huh?
Yeah, that's it, all right.
You can dish it out, but you're getting so you can't take it no more. You're through.
Well?
Well, the split's okay with me, Rico.
How about you boys?
No hard feelings, eh, Sam?
We gotta stick together.
There's a rope around my neck right now, and they only hang you once.
If anybody turns yellow and squeals...
...my gun's gonna speak its piece.
What's the matter, Antonio?
Why you don't sleep?
- You sick, maybe? Huh?
- Yeah.
- Oh, what-?
- No, can't a guy get up when he wants to...
...without answering a lot of questions?
You stay out late nights, you drink lot of wine.
- Leave me alone.
- Oh, listen, Antonio, I-
I have some spaghetti for you on the stove.
If you feel better, eat some.
Yes? It do you good.
You used to be a good boy, Antonio.
Remember when you sing in the church?
In the choir with Father McNeil?
You in white.
Remember?
Father McNeil.
The church was beautiful.
You little boy with long hair.
The tall, big candles.
Flowers.
Remember, Antonio?
Don't leave me, Ma, do you hear?
You don't have to go now, do you?
Can't you stay a little while with me?
Please, don't go away.
- Please.
- Oh, Antonio. Oh, my baby.
I no go, I stay.
Antonio.
Oh, my boy.
I'll be all right, Ma.
- You'd better run along, do you hear?
- Yes.
You run along.
Take good care of yourself, will you, huh?
And give my love to Miss Manccia, will you, huh?
Father McNeil.
Hey, Tony. Where you been?
I'm looking all over for you.
Rico wants you to come and get your split.
What's the matter, Tony?
Don't you want a split?
Are you crazy?
I'm not crazy.
And I don't want no split.
Listen, Tony.
Rico knows you lose your nerve
Now, he wants you to be a man.
You better not turn yellow.
Get away from me, Otero.
Leave me alone!
Listen, kid. I'm trying to tell you for your own good.
- Come with me and get your split.
- Ah!
Hey, TOW!
Tony, where you going?
I'm going to see Father McNeil.
Rico!
I found Tony, but it's too late.
He's crazy! Crazy!
I tell him to be a man, but he shakes his head and goes to the priest.
Well, I guess that's that.
We ain't got any time to lose.
Come on, Sam, get a car, and let's go.
Not me! Take- Take Scabby.
- Scabby's no good.
No. I'm not.
- Can you drive, Otero?
- Sure!
All right, let's go.
We'll use the black roadster.
There he is.
Tony!
Did you see all them wreaths?
That hearse is sure decked out pretty.
Well, this was no time to be tight with money.
Tony deserved a swell send-off.
- Poor kid.
- Yeah, but Rico's wreath beat them all.
It was big.
And all it had on it was "Tony. "
- Not even Rico's name.
- Yeah. Rico's no braggart.
Tony looked like he was asleep.
Didn't look a bit changed.
Beats me how they do it.
Got a match?
- Look, Rico. There's Flaherty, the bull.
- Huh?
Aah. Hmph.
Things must be getting pretty hot.
What's he want?
He's just stalling.
They ain't got a thing on me.
Gee, we're moving slow.
We got plenty of time.
The banquet won't start until 8.
Yeah.
Too bad Tony won't be there.
Yeah, that's the goods, all right.
That's the fanciest I've ever seen, Sam.
Look at those little turtledoves down here.
Friendship and loyalty, huh?
- Well, how do you like that, Sam? Huh?
Pretty good, Rico.
Otero told me I don't look good in a derby. What do you think?
- Looks just like you.
- I thought so.
I guess I'll stick to them from now on.
"Compliments to a true pal.
Mr. C. Bandello from a true pal...
...Mr. Sam Vettori. " Well, that's nice.
I appreciate, Sam. That's swell of you.
Hey, hey! Hey! Hey!
What's the matter with you birds?
Don't you know how to act at a banquet?
What do you think you are, a lot of gashouse yaps?
Well, cut the chatter.
Scabby's gonna make a speech.
Well, folks...
...you all know what we're here for...
...so what's the good of me telling you all about it?
Rico here is a great guy!
Sure, and, uh...
Well...
Say, Rico...
...I don't know how to talk fancy, but...
This here watch is for you, see?
- From the boys!
- Come on, everybody. Clap, like.
Speech!
Speech!
Oh, no, no, no.
Speech!
- Oh, well.
All right.
You birds want me to make a speech?
Here it goes.
L- I want to thank you, fellas, for this here banquet.
It sure is swell.
The liquor is good, so they tell me.
But I don't drink it, myself.
And the food don't leave nothing to be desired.
Well, I guess we're all having a swell time...
...and it sure is good to see all you gents with your molls here.
Yeah.
Well, I...
I guess that's about all.
And I wish you birds wouldn't get drunk and raise Cain...
...because that's the way a lot of birds get bumped off.
Yeah. Lay off that stuff.
I know what I'm-
A couple of newspaper guys out there want to take a picture. What do you say, boss?
Well, what do you think of that, huh?
Heh.
Sure. Send them in.
Tell them to make it snappy.
- I'll see you later.
- Oh, don't go away.
- We're going to have our pictures taken.
- I haven't had my picture taken...
...in the last 15 years.
Well, what do you think of that?
Fifteen years, he hasn't-
Come on, boys, make it snappy.
Come on, now! Quiet, everybody!
We're gonna get mugged!
There you are. Now, hold it.
Hold it, still!
- Look at the guys over there.
- That was a bad play you made then, Rico.
That flashlight.
- They might pick you up on that.
- Well, what do I care?
Don't I want folks to see what the boys think of me?
Hey, Rico, what become of that pal of yours, that dancer guy, Joe Massara?
He didn't come.
He ain't been around in a long time.
He didn't quit on you, did he, Rico?
Bad business to quit on me, Sam.
One guy tried that on me once.
Now, you mind your own business and let me tend to my own.
What does that bull want in here?
- I'll show him where he gets off.
- Careful, Rico.
Who invited you here?
You're getting up in the world, aren't you, Rico?
The downstairs is open to anybody, even cops.
But the upstairs is private.
Thanks, but I like to keep my eye on you, Rico.
You see, I'm your friend.
I like to see a young fellow getting up in the world...
...that's all.
So long.
Hurry back.
I Will.
Oh, say...
Somebody threw a brick through
Meyer Blum's window last night.
Do you happen to know anything about a diamond-and-platinum watch...
...that was stolen, do you?
If you hear anything about it, let me know, won't you?
Hm.
Banquet, eh?
Hmm.
Rico got far...
...too far.
So now he's got to stop.
I'm saying he's got to stop!
Oh, Arnie, are you fellas going to start another scrap?
What's the use of my paying heavy dues for protection...
- ... if there's no peace?
- Don't worry. There'll be peace soon enough.
I'm saying he's got to stop, so he's gonna stop.
He's been cutting in on my territory...
...and that's all wet with me.
Look, ahem.
I'm sitting here, see?
I'm sitting here quiet...
...smoking a cigarette, see?
But a couple of my boys ain't sitting here.
They're out looking for Rico, and they got their gats with them too. Catch on?
And when they find him, it won't be no banquet that Rico gets. It will be a wake!
Arnie, you know best.
I've never met Rico.
Phelps, 2284.
Hello, Otero. This is Joe Massara.
I just found out something. This is hot.
Tell Rico to look out. Little Arnie's gang is out to put one in him.
What's the matter?
- Where is Rico?
- You got me. He ain't showed up yet.
Come on, quick! We got to find him!
I want 10 of these.
Gee, you taking all these papers, Mr. Rico?
Why, sure. Ain't I got my picture in them?
Here.
- Thanks! Come again!
- That's all right.
Fine shots you are!
Oh, no!
So somebody finally put one in you.
Yeah, but they just grazed me.
The old man will be glad to hear it.
He takes such an interest in you.
Tell him the cops couldn't get me no other way, so they hired a couple of gunmen.
If I wasn't on the force,
I'd have done the job cheap.
Did you ever think how you'd look with a lily in your hand?
No, I never did.
I've been in this game a good many years, and I put the cuffs on a lot of mugs.
Someday, you and I are gonna take a ride, Rico...
...and when we do,
I'll have the cuffs on you too.
No buzzard like you will ever put any cuffs on Rico.
Hmph. Come on, boys.
I'm gonna get that swell-headed mug if it's the last thing I ever do.
Boss, I'm sorry.
I should have been with you.
They thought they hit the target, boss, but bullets just bounce off of you.
It was Little Arnie, Rico.
Joe Massara got the tip, and he called up.
We couldn't find you in time.
Joe,huh?
Well.
I didn't think he cared enough.
Well, that was white of him, all right.
I ought to give him a chance on my next job.
There. Guess I didn't study medicine for nothing, did I?
Thanks, Scabby.
I'm going to see Little Arnie tonight.
If he's looking for trouble, why, that's what we got the most of.
I want Killer Peppi,
Otero, Kid Bean and Bat to go with me.
Hmph.
Listen, handsome, open up, or you'll tell nobody nothing no more.
Tell him we're all right, and don't act nervous.
These fellas are all right.
Come on, stick them up.
Lock that door.
Where's Arnie?
In the office?
Bat, stay outside that door and don't let anybody in.
Kid, you keep them covered.
Peppi and Otero, follow me.
Come on, you. Give him the knock.
Over there.
Come on! Put them up!
Put them up! Come on!
Hello, Arnie.
- How's business?
- What's the game?
I don't know what this is all about, but it's a private row.
- You guys better beat it.
- Ain't nobody gonna leave this room.
You guys are invited to this private party.
Suppose we don't want to stay?
I wouldn't stop you for the world.
Only these boys of mine have itching fingers.
Sit down, gents.
Arnie...
...you ought to have better sense than to hire a couple of outside yaps...
...especially bad shots.
Come on. What is it?
Let's have it!
Arnie...
...you're through.
You hire these mugs, they miss.
Now you're through.
If you ain't out of town by tomorrow morning...
...you won't ever leave it except in a pine box.
I'm taking over this territory.
From now on, it's mine.
You're growing, Rico.
So this is what you've been after all the time, huh?
I seen it in your eyes the first time I met you.
You're no good, Rico.
If you think you can muscle in on me like you did on Sam Vettori, you're off your nut!
I suppose you forgot all about Pete Montana, huh?
How's Diamond Pete going to stop me?
He may be your boss, but he ain't mine.
Sam didn't feel that way about him.
- Sam knew who gave orders.
- Sam was too soft.
Diamond Pete could scare him, but I ain't no Sam.
Sam is through.
Now you're through too.
Nice stickpin you got there, Arnie.
Nothing phony about my jewelry.
Arnie...
...you better quit this racket.
You can dish it out, but you got so that you can't take it no more.
You'd better take your hats and beat it.
The first thing you know, you'll be arrested for firing a rod in the city limits.
Well...
...I guess that's about all.
Oh, uh...
Pleasant trip, gents.
Come on, boys.
Oh, thanks, boys, for the artillery.
- Well, boys. What do you think of it?
- Scabby, you're in the wrong job. It's perfect.
That means you have a new partner.
Little Caesar.
Everybody'll laugh at Scabby's story.
Gee, boss. You gave Arnie an awful walloping.
Rico...
Now you're famous.
You see, Otero.
There ain't no use in being scared of any of these big guys.
The bigger they come, the harder they fall.
Hmph. Yeah.
I ain't doing so bad in this business so far.
Well, now.
Ah, you look great, boss.
Yeah, but it feels terrible.
Aw. You're getting up in the world, Rico.
None of us ever been invited up to eat at the Big Boy's dump.
And nobody ever crashed the gate except Pete Montana.
See what I mean?
Now, you don't want the Big Boy to think you ain't got no class.
They rig you up better than this in the stir.
If you think I'm going out in this, you're crazy!
You look fine, boss.
- Go on. Take a peek at yourself.
- Oh, I don't know.
All I need is a napkin over my arm.
Now, don't you look fine?
Hm?
Yeah.
I guess maybe I don't look so bad after all.
Oh, hello. Oh.
- Hello, Big Boy.
Hello, Rico.
Huh? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Thanks.
Thanks very much.
Well, you're rather lit up tonight, aren't you?
Yeah. I thought I better put on a monkey suit.
That's right. You may as well learn now.
Yeah.
Well...
Some joint you got here.
It'll do.
Yeah.
I bet all this trick furniture set you back plenty, huh?
Well, they don't exactly give it away with cigar coupons.
Well, I'll tell the world. Heh.
Boy, it sure look-
Oh, look at that.
Do you like it?
Oh, I think it's elegant.
That cost me $15,000.
Fifteen thou-
Boy, them gold frames sure cost plenty of dough.
Well, will you have a cocktail or a dash of brandy?
Oh, no, thanks.
I never touch the stuff.
- No?
- Heh, no.
- Cigar, then?
- Oh, yeah. I'll have one of those.
Thanks.
Thanks very much.
- Sit down, Rico.
- Yeah. Thanks.
Mm.
Boy, heh-heh.
Now, listen, Rico.
I'm gonna talk to you, but you're not gonna hear a word I say, see?
This is inside dope, and if it gets out, it'll be just too bad for somebody.
You know me.
All right. Get this.
Pete Montana's through.
Yeah?
Well.
- And I thought he was such a big guy.
- He's through.
Suppose I were to tell you that from now on...
...you were Pete Montana.
That you were to take over his territory in addition to your own.
Would you shake on it?
Would I?
Would I? Heh-heh.
All right. It's set.
I'm doing a lot for you, Rico, but when I get you planted...
...I'll expect plenty of service.
Well, you'll sure get it.
Permit me, then, to drink to the new boss of the North Side.
Thank you. Heh.
Otero, what did I tell you, huh?
Heh-heh.
I knew it was coming.
I knew he had his eyes on me all the time.
And let me tell you something, Otero.
It's not only Pete Montana that's through, but the Big Boy himself.
He ain't what he used to be.
Pretty soon, he won't be able to take it, and then...
...watch me.
Sure, boss.
Pretty soon, you'll be running the whole town.
Otero, you said a mouthful.
There's a guy by the name of Massara out there. He wants to see you, sir.
- I'll see him in a minute.
- Yes, sir.
What's Joe want here?
He hasn't been near any of us for months.
I sent for him.
I heard somebody in Detroit got to Flaherty and told him to start working...
...on a dancer at the Bronze Peacock if he wanted to find out who shot McClure.
Gee, boss, you're wise to everything before it happens.
Yeah, I don't miss much.
I'll soon find out if Flaherty's been working on Joe after I have a little talk with him.
Gee, Rico, what a palace.
Oh, hello, Joe.
Yeah, it'll do.
But what do you expect?
Ain't I got 20 grand tied up in it?
- Hello, Otero. How are you, baby?
- First-rate.
Sit down, Joe.
Sure I'm good enough to sit in such a swell chair?
Come on, now. Cut the comedy.
Sit down.
Screw, Otero.
- I want to talk with Joe private.
- Sure.
See you later, Joe.
- Cigar, Joe?
- No, thanks.
Well, will you have a cocktail or a dash of brandy?
No.
Well, it surprise you to hear from me?
Kind of.
I thought it would be kind of nice to have a little talk together...
...like old times.
Certainly is nice to see you, Rico.
Especially like this.
- You're looking good.
- You're looking good too, Joe.
Living easy, kind of, huh?
- Not that easy. Dancing's no cinch.
- Yeah, but you ain't complaining.
- No. No, I ain't complaining.
- That's good.
Yeah.
Dancing's all right for a sideline.
It gives you a swell front.
But it ain't my idea of a man's game.
What's the difference, Rico?
As long as I ain't kicking, why should you kick?
Who's kicking?
Only why should a young guy like you be wasting his time?
And I kind of took pride in you, Joe...
...brought you into the gang, pushed you ahead.
But now you're getting to be a sissy.
We got to go into that again?
Can't you just forget about me?
I don't want to forget, Joe. You're my pal.
We started off together, didn't we?
We've got to keep going along together.
Who else do I got to give a hang about?
I need you, Joe.
I've got the biggest chance of my life.
The Big Boyjust handed me the whole North Side...
...but it's too much for one man to handle alone. I need somebody, a guy like you...
- ... somebody I can trust.
- Can't be me, Rico.
I've quit.
You didn't quit.
Nobody ever quit me.
You're still in my gang, you got that?
I don't care how many fancy skirts you've got hanging on to you.
That jane's made a softy out of you.
- You lay off Olga.
- I ain't laying off. I'm after her!
One of us has to lose, and it won't be me.
There's ways of stopping that dame.
- You're crazy. Leave her out of this!
- She's through, out of the way.
- You're lying. You wouldn't dare!
- I wouldn't?
- I'll show you!
- Rico, listen.
We're in love with one another.
Don't that mean nothing?
Nothing. Less than nothing.
Love. Soft stuff!
When she's got you, you ain't no good for anything.
We ain't out of this yet...
...and we don't want no softies spilling things!
I won't spill anything, if you're scared of that.
- You think I want my neck stretched?
- Well, you know too much.
I ain't gonna take any chances.
You're hanging around with me, see?
No, I'm not.
All right.
You go back to that dame...
...and it's suicide.
Suicide for both of you.
Just stick here.
Hello?
Oh, hello, Big Boy.
No. No, I don't want that guy.
I don't trust him.
Yeah. I got a kid by the name of Joe Massara who'll help me.
Yeah. All right, goodbye, Big Boy.
Oh, Joe...
- Joe.
- Olga.
- We've gotta go. Hurry!
- Joe, what's the matter?
Didn't you hear what I said?
Hurry! Hurry!
- Yes, Joe. Oh, you're ill.
- I'm all right.
- Rico.
- What did he do to you?
Oh, didn't I know it?
He, Rico-
He said you and me got to quit.
He'd kill you unless I stuck with him.
I ran away.
We've got to get out of here.
Anywhere. As long as we get away!
No.
- No? You're not coming?
- No.
That's not the way.
But, Olga, you don't know that guy!
- Olga, you've got to! Please!
- No.
Sit down, Joe.
- We've got to think.
- I don't want to think or sit down.
- You're coming.
- Don't you see? It would be no use!
Where? Where would we go?
Where would we run to?
There's no place he wouldn't find us.
There's only one thing for us to do.
Flaherty
You're crazy.
You think that would save us?
Flaherty? That's worse than suicide
- I won't do it. I can't.
- Well, I can do it.
That gang must go. Rico must go.
I want my happiness, Joe. I want you.
We'll never have peace till Rico's gone.
I'm going to do it.
Olga, don't! Please! Stay here!
Olga, open this door!
Olga, open this door! Hurry!
Park, 1000.
Olga. Don't call Flaherty.
Please open this door, quickly!
Rico will kill us both!
Headquarters, I want Sergeant Flaherty.
Sergeant Flaherty, this is Olga Stassoff.
I've got Joe Massara with me.
In my apartment.
17 Edsel Drive.
Yes. Yes, he wants to talk to you.
Hurry, hurry!
Come on, boys, we're going to a party.
Who's giving the party?
- Joe Massara.
- Formal or informal?
I don't know, but we'll find out when we get there.
You shouldn't have done it.
You shouldn't have.
There was no other way.
No other right way.
- It's the rope for me.
- No, it isn't.
Not if you turn state's evidence.
We'll make them promise everything will be okay.
Wait, Olga!
Joe!
There he is, the dirty double-crosser.
Give it to him, Rico!
No.
Shoot.
Shoot, Rico.
Get it over with.
Come on, Otero! Let's go!
You're getting soft too.
What's the matter with you? Come on!
Joe.
- Who was it?
- Otero! He and Rico. Through the window!
Go on, boys. Go and get him!
Are you ready to talk now, Joe?
Well, I'll talk. It was Rico's gang that held up the Bronze Peacock.
It was Rico who shot McClure.
That dirty, low, sneaking-
Well, Joe will tell you. Ask him.
He knows it was Rico.
Is that right, Joe?
Was it Rico?
- Where's your phone?
- In there.
Oh, Joe. Here, let me help you.
Park, 1000.
Hello, Dan, this is Flaherty.
Round up that Palermo gang.
I got enough on them to use a mile of rope.
Shoot the cars right out, and above all, get Rico.
We've gotta watch our step.
The cops are sure to be cruising around.
- You should have plugged Joe.
- And the dame.
If they ain't squealed about McClure yet, they'll do it now.
- From now on, we're hot.
- Yeah.
This is what I get for liking a guy too much.
Come on.
Halt!
Halt!
Go on, Rico.
I'm done for.
Go on, Rico.
Sam! Sam!
Joe Massara! They nabbed him over the McClure business, and he squawked.
Rico tried to get him.
Now they're after him. They got Otero.
Otero?
- Sam, don't you get me?
- What are you sitting there for?
- What else can I do?
I can't run now.
They'd get me anyhow.
You're out of your head.
Come on, get up. Let's beat it!
It's no use.
Put them up! Don't move!
Hand over your guns.
All right. Take them down to the car.
You'd better give up, Sam.
Drop that gun before we start shooting.
Come on in.
Get on your feet and put your hands up.
Put the cuffs on him.
You ain't got nothing on me.
Nothing but the bracelets.
And we haven't got a thing on Rico, either.
He's next.
- There's nobody in there.
- No?
Well, listen, Ma. If you see Rico, you'd better let us know, quick.
Well...
...you got yourself in a nice fix.
- Yeah.
- The cops were just here.
- They got Otero.
Uh-huh.
Ma, I'm gonna stay here a day or two, then I want a car.
Gonna cost you big, because I'm taking big chances.
I got 10 grand planted here.
Help yourself.
When you're ready to start,
I'll give you $150.
You'll give me?
Whose money is this?
Who do you think you're talking to?
I need plenty. My money is hidden in the apartment. I can't get to it.
I'll give you $150. Take it or leave it.
Why, you dirty, thieving old hag, I'll-
No, you won't.
Because I'm the only one knows where the money's hid.
Kill me, and you won't get a cent.
I'll give you $150...
...if you'll be a good boy.
He was mean, Sam Vettori was.
So now he's got what was coming to him.
What does it say in the paper?
"Former gang chief faints on scaffold.
Hmph.
After a futile battle in the courts...
...Sam Vettori, former gang leader...
...today presented a pitiful figure...
...as the hangman's noose was placed around his neck. "
Listen. "Little Caesar has never been found.
According to the statement of Lieutenant
Thomas Flaherty of the homicide squad...
...Little Caesar, the once swaggering braggart of the underworld...
...wilted in the face of real danger and showed the world his cowardice.
Flaherty stated further that Little Caesar has contradicted his oft-repeated boast...
...that he could dish it out and take it too. "
Yeah.
"When a real crisis arose...
...Rico couldn't take it.
Flaherty ended his interview by remarking:
'Meteoric as was Rico's rise from the gutter...
...it was inevitable that he should return there. "'
Eh.
Well, just the same, he was the real leader of that gang.
Don't you believe it.
Rico didn't have the nerve, and he didn't have the brains.
He was yellow, just like Flaherty said.
Here!
- That's what Rico-
- Give me that paper!
Hey, watch it!
- What's the matter with him?
Must be crazy.
I'll show them where they get off.
Trying to put that kind of stuff about me in the papers, huh?
I'll show them- Hello?
Hello? I want Park, 1000.
Yeah. Yeah, I can't take it no more, huh?
I'll tell that guy where to-
Hello? Park, 1000?
- Get me Flaherty, and get him quick.
- Sure. Just a minute.
Tom. Oh, Tom.
I may be screwy, but this sounds like Rico.
Yeah?
- Flaherty speaking.
- Yeah, this is Rico speaking!
Rico! R-I-C-O, Rico!
Little Caesar, that's who!
You're a big guy, ain't you?
Shooting your mouth off in the papers.
So I ran out when it got hot, huh?
I can't take it no more?
Well, listen, you crummy, flatfooted copper...
...I'll show you whether
I lost my nerve.
Thanks, Rico, old boy.
The same to you and many of them.
Come on, tell me some more.
The sound of your voice does my heart good.
Trace that call. Find out where he's phoning from, quick.
Uh-huh.
Say, why didn't you come to Sam's neck-stretching party, Rico?
It was a big success.
Hm. Funny guy, ain't you, Flaherty?
Well, you ain't got much longer to laugh.
I'm coming, and I'm gonna put one in your dirty hide...
...for every lying crack that you made about me, see?
I'll show you who's gonna finish up in the gutter.
We've missed you, Rico.
The town has been nice and quiet.
I'm putting on weight.
River, 6547. It's a flophouse down at 4th and Commercial.
All right. All right, big mouth.
Get your hat and star': running, see, because you're all through.
Call the papers and tell them that, you rotten, dirty, lying copper!
Hm.
I knew we'd hear from that guy if I kept giving it to him in the papers.
The conceit of that guy.
They'll have to build a special noose to get that swelled head of his through.
Well, wish me luck.
There he is. That's Rico, all right.
Pull in there.
You'd better give up, Rico.
You haven't got a chance.
You'll have to come and get me.
You'd better be a nice boy, Rico, and come out.
You heard me!
If you want me, come and get me!
I'll be with you in a minute.
Give me that chopper.
This is your last chance, Rico.
Are you coming out, or do you want to be carried out?
Well, Rico, it looks like you and I are going to take that little ride together.
No...
No, we ain't.
I told you a little buzzard like you will never put any cuffs on me.
You should have come out when I told you to, Rico.
Mother of mercy.
Is this the end of Rico?

IT'S GOOD TO SEE THE FACE
OF AN OLD FRIEND AGAIN.
ONE OF THE BEST MARKSMAN
IT HAS EVER BEEN
MY GOOD FORTUNE
TO ENTERTAIN,
YOU KNOW, SIR HUMPHREY.
YOUR OWN HUNTING SKILL,
AMIR SAHIB,
COMPELS ME TO DEPLORE
MY POOR MARKSMANSHIP.
[CHUCKLES]
YOU BRITISH...
SO ADEPT
AT DIPLOMATIC GRACES
THAT EVEN MY OWN RACE
BOWS TO YOUR FINESSE.
GENTLEMEN...
I WOULD BE
INCONSIDERATE, INDEED,
TO INSIST ON ANY LENGTHY
COURT FORMALITIES.
SHALL WE DISPENSE
WITH THEM?
[SIR HUMPHREY]
DELIGHTED.
[CLAP CLAP]
[MUSIC PLAYING]
YOU'RE WELCOME,
VICKERS.
THANK YOU,
YOUR HIGHNESS.
I REGRET AS DEEPLY AS YOU,
SIR HUMPHREY,
THAT SO FAR
THE NEGOTIATIONS
SHOULD HAVE PROVEN
SO BARREN OF RESULTS.
WHILE IT IS REGRETTABLE,
WE MUST REMEMBER
THAT THE TREATY
BY WHICH
YOUR FOSTER FATHER
RECEIVED ANNUALLY
A SUM OF MONEY
FROM MY GOVERNMENT
FOR HIS EXTRAORDINARY
SERVICES
CEASED AUTOMATICALLY
TO EXIST ON THE OCCASION
OF HIS DEATH.
FOR MYSELF, I SHALL
DO MY HUMBLE BEST
TO ACCEPT WITH GRACE
THIS SUDDEN WITHDRAWAL
OF FINANCIAL SUPPORT.
AND MAY I NOT
ADD FURTHER
THAT MY GOVERNMENT
LOOKS FORWARD HOPEFULLY
TO CONTINUED FRIENDSHIP
WITH ITS NEIGHBORS,
THE TRIBES OF SURISTAN?
OF COURSE, I SHALL ENDEAVOR
TO CONVINCE THE NAWABS
AND MALIKS OF SURISTAN
THAT THE ACTION
OF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT
IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED
AS UNFRIENDLY,
CALM THEIR NATURAL
RESENTMENT,
AND CURB ANY ACTIVE
REPRISALS THEY MIGHT
SO EASILY CONTEMPLATE.
I AM CONFIDENT
THAT YOUR HIGHNESS'
PRAISEWORTHY EFFORTS
WILL BE REWARDED
WITH SUCCESS.
LET US HOPE
THAT YOUR CONFIDENCE
IS JUSTIFIED.
YOU KNOW, SIR HUMPHREY,
CONFIDENCE IS
AN ADMIRABLE QUALITY.
WE SO SELDOM
APPRECIATE IT FULLY...
UNTIL IT IS WITHDRAWN.
[PEARSON]
YOU KNOW, THE FIRST TIME
I WAS IN BENGAL,
I SAW A FALCON
BREAK A LAMB'S BACK.
BEASTLY BIRDS.
YES, I THINK
I'LL SEND ONE
BACK TO MY FAMILY.
JUST THE THING
FOR A MAYFAIR
DRAWING ROOM.
ANCIENT SPORT
OF KINGS--FALCONRY.
THE APPEAL LIES
IN ITS CRUELTY.
I'D TAKE A POTSHOT
AGAINST A TIGER
IN LONG GRASS ANY DAY.
THEY'RE MAN-EATERS,
YOU KNOW.
ONLY A SAVAGE
WOULD PREFER
THIS SORT OF THING.
[SIR HUMPHREY]
AHEM. QUITE SO.
QUITE SO, VICKERS.
WHY, YOUR HIGHNESS,
I MEANT, OF COURSE--
NO, NO, NO, NO.
I DARESAY YOU'RE
PERFECTLY JUSTIFIED.
HOWEVER, THE SURISTANIS
ARE AN ANCIENT RACE
OF PEOPLE.
THEY CANNOT SO EASILY
FORGET THEIR ANCIENT
TRIBAL WAYS OF LIFE.
THANK YOU, SIR.
I TRUST YOU'LL
ACCEPT MY APOLOGY.
OH, PLEASE,
PLEASE, PLEASE.
BORIS.
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
GENTLEMEN, LET US
GO IN TO DINNER.
UH, BY THE WAY,
SIR HUMPHREY,
YOU WOULD DO ME
THE HONOR IF YOU
AND YOUR GENTLEMEN
WERE TO JOIN ME
TOMORROW MORNING
AT A LEOPARD HUNT
I'VE ARRANGED.
WE START AT SUNRISE,
THE TRADITIONAL HOUR.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
[MEN SHOUTING]
[ELEPHANT TRUMPETS]
FINE FELLOW--
THE KHAN.
THERE'S A MAN
WHO CAN TAKE A LOSS
WITH GOOD GRACE.
YES. I DON'T THINK
I COULD LOSE £150,000
A YEAR WITH GRACE.
GREAT SCOTT,
VICKERS!
NOBODY BUT
THE HOME GOVERNMENT
WERE SUPPOSED
TO KNOW ANYTHING
OF THE REAL REASON BEHIND
THIS DIPLOMATIC VISIT
OF MINE.
SORRY, SIR, BUT UP HERE
ON THE FRONTIER,
THERE AREN'T
MANY SECRETS AN OFFICER
IN MY POSITION
DOESN'T GET TO KNOW
SOONER OR LATER.
BESIDES, I'VE COME
TO KNOW THE KHAN
PRETTY WELL.
THEN YOU MUST KNOW
THE SITUATION HAS BEEN
A DEVILISH, DELICATE ONE.
HOWEVER, I AM
QUITE CONFIDENT
THAT HE WON'T TRIFLE
WITH OUR FRIENDSHIP.
BESIDES,
THE MAN'S A GENTLEMAN.
ANYONE CAN SEE THAT.
YES, OF COURSE, SIR.
YES.
ANYONE CAN SEE THAT.
[DRUMS BEATING
AND MEN SHOUTING]
[GROWLING]
[GROWLS]
YOU HAVE THE HONOR,
SIR HUMPHREY.
THE KHAN WANTS
YOU TO TAKE
FIRST SHOT, SIR.
HUH? OH. OH.
THANK YOU. SPLENDID.
[GUNSHOT]
MISSED HIM
BY A HAIR, SIR.
BAD LUCK.
[GUNSHOT]
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
FINE SHOT, SIR.
[SIR HUMPHREY]
EXCELLENT MARKSMANSHIP, SIR.
[SURAT KHAN SPEAKING

[ELEPHANT TRUMPETING]
[SHOUTING
IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
[GROWLS]
[GROWLS]
[LEOPARD GROWLING]
SAHIB.
[MEN SHOUTING
IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
ARE YOU HURT,
YOUR HIGHNESS?
NO, NOT AT ALL.
BRILLIANT SHOT,
VICKERS.
IT WAS WORTHY
OF YOU.
IT WAS A LUCKY ONE.
I SHALL NEVER
FORGET IT.
MY GRATITUDE
WILL BE ETERNAL.
[SPEAKING
FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
WELL, GOOD-BYE,
DARLING.
GOOD-BYE, DEAR.
NOW, REMEMBER,
YOU SIMPLY MUST BE
BACK EARLY
IF WE'RE TO BE READY
FOR THE GOVERNOR GENERAL'S
BALL TONIGHT.
OH, THE BALL, YES.
I SUPPOSE YOU FEEL
QUITE CAPABLE
OF TAKING CARE
OF YOURSELF
AMONG ALL THESE--
OH, HOW SILLY.
A RESPONSIBLE LADY
OF MY YEARS IS
PERFECTLY SAFE ANYWHERE.
YES, I SUPPOSE SO.
WELL...GOOD-BYE.
[SPEAKING
FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
GOOD-BYE.
[SPEAKING
FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
ELSA, I'M SO GLAD
YOU WERE ABLE TO COME.
YOUR MESSAGE SAID
IT WAS URGENT.
IT IS.
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
MY BROTHER ARRIVES
IN CALCUTTA TODAY.
HOW DO YOU KNOW?
WORD CAME THROUGH
FROM HEADQUARTERS
LAST NIGHT.
NOW YOU'LL UNDERSTAND
WHY IT WAS SO URGENT
FOR ME TO SEE YOU.
GEOFFREY'S
COMING HERE.
ELSA,
THERE'S SOMETHING
I MUST KNOW.
YOU DO LOVE ME,
DON'T YOU?
OH, PERRY.
I KNOW WE BOTH TRIED
TO BE LOYAL TO GEOFFREY
BY HIDING
OUR REAL FEELINGS,
BUT NOW HE'S
COMING BACK, AND WE
CAN'T GO ON PRETENDING.
YOU DO LOVE ME,
DON'T YOU?
OH, PERRY, I'VE TRIED
SO HARD NOT TO,
BUT I DO LOVE YOU.
I KNEW IT.
BUT I'M STILL ENGAGED
TO GEOFFREY.
WE MUST TELL HIM
THE MOMENT HE GETS HERE.
I MEAN, I MUST TELL HIM.
IT'S MY RESPONSIBILITY.
AND WHEN HE KNOWS
HOW WE FEEL, HE WON'T
STAND IN OUR WAY.
BUT SUPPOSING
HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND.
HE WILL.
DARLING, I KNOW HIM
BETTER THAN ANYONE.
I'VE GOT TO TELL HIM.
IT'S THE ONLY DECENT
THING TO DO.
YES.
YES, IT IS.
I MUST BE GETTING
BACK NOW.
FATHER WILL BE
WORRYING ABOUT ME.
YES. YOU'RE RIGHT.
WILL I SEE YOU
TONIGHT AT THE BALL?
YES, PERRY...
TONIGHT.
IT'S ONLY NOW THAT
THE STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE
OF THE SITUATION
BECOMES APPARENT.
THE SAFETY OF
THE NORTHWEST FRONTIER
HINGES ON LOHARA,
WHICH IS THE BASE
FOR THE THREE
ADVANCE GARRISONS,
OF WHICH CHUKOTI
IS THE MOST IMPORTANT.
THEREFORE, TWO
OF OUR ABLEST OFFICERS
MUST COMMAND AT LOHARA
AND CHUKOTI.
I'VE HAD TO
TRANSFER WOODWARD
BECAUSE I'M AFRAID
HE'S TOO WELL ON IN YEARS
FOR AN ACTIVE COMMAND.
YOU SEE, WITH
SURAT KHAN JUST ACROSS
THE SURISTAN BORDER
IN A POSITION TO MAKE
THE APPROACH TO THE PASS
UNCOMFORTABLE,
I FEEL CONFIDENT
THAT WITH YOU,
CAMPBELL, AT CHUKOTI
AND YOU, WARRENTON,
AT LOHARA,
WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO HANDLE
ANY AGGRESSIVE COMPLICATION
THAT MAY ARISE.
CAPTAIN VICKERS,
SIR.
YES, SIR.
OH, SHOW HIM IN.
JUST A MOMENT.
CAPTAIN VICKERS,
27th LANCERS,
REPORTING FOR DUTY, SIR.
[MAN]
BEEN EXPECTING YOU,
VICKERS.
THE WAR OFFICE
IS SENDING YOU ON
A VERY IMPORTANT MISSION.
OH, SPLENDID,
SIR.
YOU'RE GOING
ON AN EXPEDITION
TO BUY CAVALRY HORSES
IN THE TATAR COUNTRIES.
OH.
DOES THAT MEAN
WE'RE PREPARING
FOR WAR, SIR?
WHATEVER IT MEANS,
YOU'RE TO DELIVER
THE HORSES YOU'VE PURCHASED
TO OUR FLEET AT BATUM
ON THE BLACK SEA.
FROM THERE,
THEY'RE TO BE SHIPPED
TO THE CRIMEA.
THAT CLEAR?
YES, SIR.
OH, WARRENTON, CAMPBELL,
YOU KNOW VICKERS.
[CAMPBELL]
YES, OF COURSE.
GEOFFREY, MY BOY,
HOW VERY NICE
TO SEE YOU.
GLAD TO SEE YOU,
TOO, SIR.
HOW DO YOU      HOW DO YOU DO,
DO, SIR?        VICKERS?
HAVE YOU SEEN ELSA?
NO, NOT YET, SIR.
HOW IS SHE?
SHE'LL BE VERY HAPPY
TO SEE YOU, I KNOW.
I CAN HARDLY WAIT
UNTIL I SEE HER EITHER.
GOOD MORNING, SIR.
GOOD MORNING.
OH, CAPTAIN VICKERS.
YES?
YOUR BROTHER IS HERE, SIR,
INSIDE WITH SIR CHARLES.
OH, YES. THANK YOU.
YES, SIR.
[PERRY]
GEOFF.
PERRY!
BY JOVE,
I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU,
YOU OLD DIPLOMATIC
GLOBETROTTER, YOU!
IT MUST BE
MORE THAN A YEAR
SINCE WE LAST MET.
COME IN HERE, GEOFFREY.
IT'S QUIETER. I HAVE SOMETHING
IMPORTANT TO SAY TO YOU.
I BET YOU HAVE. I HAVE
AT LEAST A MILLION
THINGS TO SAY TO YOU,
EVERY ONE OF THEM
OF VITAL IMPORTANCE.
WELL,
LET'S GO INSIDE.
NO. I CAN'T JUST NOW.
I GOT A VERY URGENT
APPOINTMENT.
TONIGHT AND TOMORROW,
WE CAN TALK
OUR HEADS OFF,
BUT JUST NOW...
SEE YOU LATER.
SO, YOU SEE, IT DEPENDS
ON YOU, GENTLEMEN.
AND I THOUGHT I WAS
WELL-ACQUAINTED
WITH THE SITUATION.
BUT I DON'T QUITE
UNDERSTAND
SURAT KHAN'S
PRESENCE IN
CALCUTTA, SIR.
AND THIS DANCE THAT
THE GOVERNOR GENERAL
IS GIVING
IN HIS HONOR
AT THE GOVERNMENT
HOUSE TONIGHT.
FLATTERY IS
THE FOOD OF FOOLS,
BUT NOW AND THEN,
YOUR MEN OF WIT
WILL CONDESCEND
TO TAKE A BIT.
I SEE. FLATTERY
AND FRIENDSHIP,
SO TO SPEAK.
SURAT KHAN, DEVILING US UP
ON THE FRONTIER,
SEEMS TO BE DOING PRECISELY
WHAT THE RUSSIAN CZAR
IS DOING IN THE BALKANS.
YOU'VE READ
THE NEWS DISPATCHES
ABOUT THE COSSACKS
PLUNDERING OUTLYING
TURKISH VILLAGES.
MMM. IT'S AN OLD TRICK,
YOU KNOW--
DEVILING YOUR NEIGHBOR
INTO A WAR.
ONE WOULD ALMOST
THINK THAT THERE'S
RUSSIAN INFLUENCE
AT THE BACK
OF SURAT KHAN,
WHAT WITH RUSSIA'S
VITAL NEED FOR
OPEN-WATER SEAPORTS,
AMONGST OTHER THINGS.
YOU'LL ACT ONLY
ON ORDERS FROM SIR BENJAMIN.
I UNDERSTAND, SIR.
I WANT YOU
TO UNDERSTAND, ALSO,
THAT IT'S IMPERATIVE
THERE SHOULD BE
NO INCIDENT
THAT COULD CAUSE
A FRONTIER WAR
AT THIS TIME.
WE MUST MAINTAIN PEACE...
AT ANY COST.
[MAN SHOUTING COMMANDS

[MAN]
MAJOR GORDON
AND MRS. GORDON.
SIR ARCHIBALD McMURRAY.
LADY McMURRAY.
MISS VERONICA McMURRAY.
SIR CHARLES MILLER
AND LADY MILLER.
[WARRENTON]
YOU REMEMBER
MAJOR BARRETT.
OH, MAJOR BARRETT.
AND,
LADY PELHAM,
MY WIFE.
LADY PELHAM,
GOOD EVENING.
AND THIS, MY DEAR,
IS COLONEL CAMPBELL,
WHO LEAVES TOMORROW
TO ASSUME COMMAND
OF THE CHUKOTI GARRISON.
COLONEL CAMPBELL,
I AM PLEASED THAT
WE HAVE MET AT LAST.
BENJI,
KINDLY STAY HERE.
MY DEAR,
I WAS JUST GOING--
TO THE REFRESHMENT ROOM
TO GET A DRINK. I KNOW.
THEN YOU'LL BE
UPSET ALL NIGHT.
HERE. TAKE A PILL.
LIFE WITH YOU IS
JUST ONE BLASTED
PILL AFTER ANOTHER--
UH, MY LOVE.
HA HA HA! JUST LIKE
A CHILD--BENJI.
NO IDEA OF WHAT'S
GOOD FOR HIM.
I HEAR YOU HAVE
A BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTER,
COLONEL.
YOU MUST LET ME TAKE HER
UNDER MY WING AT ONCE.
ABOUT TO BE MARRIED,
ISN'T SHE?
THAT'S SPLENDID.
YOU MUST LET ME CHOOSE
HER TROUSSEAU.
YOU'RE A WIDOWER,
ARE YOU NOT?
I AM,
LADY WARRENTON.
WELL, I ALWAYS SAY...
BENJI.
YES. I KNOW.
TAKE ANOTHER PILL.
[GEOFF]
ELSA, DARLING.
YOU LOOK SO LOVELY.
I'M SORRY I MISSED YOU
AT THE HOUSE.
[ELSA]
I'M SORRY, TOO, GEOFF.
[GEOFF]
WHY, IT'S BEEN SO LONG,
I HARDLY KNOW
WHAT TO SAY TO YOU.
WE'LL HAVE PLENTY
OF TIME NOW, THOUGH.
I HATE THESE SEPARATIONS.
[ELSA]
YOU DIDN'T TELL HIM,
DID YOU?
[PERRY]
I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE.
[ELSA]
HOW I HATE THIS DECEPTION.
[PERRY]
ELSA, DARLING,
THEY'RE WATCHING.
[MAN]
HIS HIGHNESS SURAT KHAN,
AMIR OF SURISTAN.
COUNT IGOR VOLONOFF.
HIS EXCELLENCY
THE WAZIR OF SURISTAN.
THE NAWAB OF DAJAL.
TAKE CHARGE,
MY FRIEND.
I'M ON DUTY.
TAKE CHARGE
OF WHAT?
[WOMAN]
MY! HOW YOU'VE CHANGED.
[RANDALL]
FOR THE BETTER, I HOPE.
[WOMAN]
I ALWAYS LIKED THE CAVALRY.
MAY I HAVE A WORD
WITH YOU, SIR?
HMM? CERTAINLY.
SURAT KHAN'S
JUST ARRIVED.
WELL?
HE'S GOT
A COUNT IGOR VOLONOFF
WITH HIM.
AH, VOLONOFF. THAT'S
A JUICY, CLEVER GESTURE.
OSTENTATIOUSLY FLIRTING
WITH RUSSIA, EH?
TWO STRINGS TO HIS BOW.
AH, WELL, WE'LL SEE.
OF COURSE, IT MIGHT BE
JUST A COINCIDENCE.
THE SUN MIGHT RISE
IN THE WEST.
WELL, I'LL FINISH
MY DRINK.
I HAVE
A COWARDLY AVERSION
TO MEETING REPTILES
SOCIALLY
TILL I'VE HAD
AT LEAST ONE SHERRY
AND BITTERS.
GOOD EVENING,
SIR CHARLES,
CAPTAIN VICKERS.
GOOD EVENING,
YOUR HIGHNESS.
SIR CHARLES MACEFIELD,
MAY I HAVE THE PLEASURE
OF PRESENTING COUNT VOLONOFF?
CAPTAIN VICKERS,
COUNT VOLONOFF.
HOW DO YOU DO?
HOW DO YOU DO?
HOW DO YOU DO?
IT'S VERY PLEASANT,
YOUR HIGHNESS,
TO FIND YOU
IN THESE FRIVOLOUS
SURROUNDINGS.
WELL, SIR CHARLES,
SINCE YOUR KINDLY GOVERNMENT
HAS SPARED ME THE BURDEN
OF DISPENSING ITS ANNUAL
APPRECIATION TO MY COUNTRYMEN,
I AM BLESSED
WITH MORE LEISURE.
AH, WELL,
COME WITH ME.
I'LL PRESENT
SOME REALLY AMUSING
PEOPLE TO YOU.
THERE'S
MY DAUGHTER NOW.
SHE'S ENTRANCING.
ELSA IS A FINE GAL.
AND THE GALLANT
YOUNG CAVALIER
WHO HOLDS HER SO TENDERLY
IN HIS ARMS--
HER FIANCE, OF COURSE.
OH, CERTAINLY NOT.
BUT SHE IS ENGAGED.
YOU SAID SHE--
TO CAPTAIN
GEOFFREY VICKERS
OF THE 27th.
THAT'S MERELY
HIS BROTHER,
A DIPLOMAT OF SORTS,
SECONDED
FROM HIS REGIMENT
FOR DUTY
WITH THE POLITICAL
DEPARTMENT.
OH, DEAR.
HOW SILLY OF ME.
THEY DO SEEM TO BE ENJOYING
EACH OTHER'S COMPANY.
[PERRY]
LET'S GET AWAY FROM HERE, ELSA.
CHARMING...
AND MOTHERLESS.
WELL, AS I ALWAYS SAY,
COLONEL, IT'S NEVER TOO LATE.
I MUST START LOOKING AROUND
RIGHT AWAY
TO FIND A SUITABLE WIFE
FOR YOU.
REALLY, OCTAVIA.
YOU MUST BE A LITTLE
MORE GUARDED--
KEEP QUIET, BENJI.
COLONEL CAMPBELL HAS
JUST BEEN BEGGING ME
TO FIND HIM A WIFE.
WHAT PARTICULAR QUALITY DO YOU
MOST ADMIRE IN A WOMAN?
THE QUALITY
OF SILENCE.
NOW, COLONEL,
YOU'RE FLATTERING ME,
JUST AS
DEAR LORD MELVIN DID.
ONCE WHEN WE SAT
NEXT TO EACH OTHER
IN AN INTOLERABLE
GUILDHALL BANQUET,
"LADY WARRENTON,"
HE SAID,
"YOU HAVE THE POWER
TO DRIVE MEN MAD."
I CAN BELIEVE THAT.
FORGIVE ME.
WHAT A DULL DOG
THE COLONEL IS.
HASN'T A WORD TO SAY
FOR HIMSELF.
BENJI.
[PERRY]
I LOVE YOU
SO MUCH, ELSA.
YOU LOOK
SO BEAUTIFUL.
I--I CAN'T STAND
THIS ANY LONGER.
WE'VE GOT TO
FIND A WAY TO TELL
GEOFFREY TONIGHT.
YES, YES.
I KNOW, I KNOW.
WE SHOULDN'T BE SEEN OUT HERE
TOGETHER. YOU KNOW THIS PLACE
IS FULL OF SCANDALMONGERS.
BUT I HAD TO SEE YOU
ALONE.
WE CAN'T GO ON
DECEIVING GEOFFREY
LIKE THIS.
DARLING, I KNOW
HE'LL UNDERSTAND.
HE'S A GREAT FELLOW.
HE'S HUMAN.
IT'S JUST BECAUSE OF THAT
WE MUSTN'T HURT HIM ANY MORE
THAN WE CAN HELP.
LET ME TELL HIM
IN MY OWN WAY. AFTER ALL,
IT'S MY RESPONSIBILITY.
WHEN HE KNOWS
HOW WE REALLY FEEL,
HE CAN'T THINK
THAT WE'RE IN THE WRONG.
WRONG?
IT'S ONLY WRONG
IF WE DON'T TELL HIM.
LET'S FACE THE TRUTH.
WE'RE IN LOVE
WITH ONE ANOTHER.
WE ALWAYS WILL BE.
[COLONEL CAMPBELL]
ELSA.
YOU WILL RETURN
TO THE BALLROOM
AT ONCE.
MAY I SAY, SIR--
I AM NOT INTERESTED
IN WHAT YOU HAVE
TO SAY.
THERE CAN BE
NO EXCUSE FOR A MAN
WHO IS SO DISLOYAL
AS TO TRIFLE
WITH THE AFFECTIONS OF
HIS BROTHER'S FIANCEE.
I FORBID YOU
TO EVER SEE OR SPEAK
TO MY DAUGHTER AGAIN.
I AM NOT BEING
DISLOYAL, SIR.
ELSA AND I
LOVE EACH OTHER.
LOVE?
CHEAP INFATUATION.
YOU DESERVE
A GOOD THRASHING.
PERRY...PLEASE GO.
AND AS I DOUBT THAT
YOU HAVE THE COURAGE
TO INFORM YOUR BROTHER
OF THIS TREACHERY,
REST ASSURED
THAT I SHALL TELL HIM.
MY BROTHER KNOWS ME
TOO WELL TO ACCUSE ME
OF TREACHERY, SIR.
ELSA, I'LL SEE YOU
AGAIN BEFORE YOU LEAVE
FOR CHUKOTI.
ONE MOMENT,
CAPTAIN VICKERS.
EVEN THOUGH
YOU'VE BEEN SECONDED
FOR THE POLITICAL
SERVICE,
YOU STILL RETAIN
YOUR ARMY RANK.
WELL, SIR?
THEREFORE, YOU
WILL DO AS I SAY.
IF NOT, I SHALL
HAVE YOU RECALLED
TO ENGLAND
FOR GROSS
INSUBORDINATION.
VERY WELL, SIR.
[CLICKS HEELS]
ELSA, I AM
AT AN ABSOLUTE LOSS
TO UNDERSTAND
YOUR ATTITUDE.
FATHER, I LOVE HIM.
YOU REALLY BELIEVE
YOU LOVE?
I SEE.
NOW I UNDERSTAND
THE STRANGENESS
OF YOUR BEHAVIOR
FOR SOME TIME PAST.
BUT YOU
MUST REMEMBER...
THAT YOU LOVED
GEOFFREY WHEN
YOU ACCEPTED HIM.
HE'S BEEN AWAY
A LONG TIME,
AND NOW
THAT HE'S BACK,
YOU MUST REALIZE
THAT THAT LOVE
IS STILL THERE
AND THIS IS
MERELY A PASSING
INFATUATION.
I WISH
YOU WERE RIGHT, FATHER.
I'VE FOUGHT AND FOUGHT
AGAINST IT,
BUT I LOVE HIM.
ELSA, MY DEAR,
I'VE TAKEN CARE
OF YOU
EVER SINCE
YOUR MOTHER DIED.
LET ME KNOW WHAT
IS BEST FOR YOU.
GEOFFREY'S
A SPLENDID FELLOW,
LOVES YOU
WITH ALL HIS HEART.
YOU CAN'T
WANTONLY HURT HIM.
OH, I DON'T WISH
TO HURT GEOFFREY.
OF COURSE YOU DON'T,
MY DARLING.
THERE, NOW.
DRY YOUR EYES.
LET'S FORGET THIS
LITTLE INCIDENT,
AND PROMISE
WHEN YOU MEET HIM
TONIGHT,
YOU'LL TREAT HIM
AS THOUGH NOTHING
HAS HAPPENED.
I'LL TRY, FATHER.
THAT'S A GIRL.
COME.
WILL YOUR HIGHNESS
EXCUSE ME?
WHY, OF COURSE.
SOME BEAUTIFUL
LADY IS WAITING,
NO DOUBT.
YES, NO DOUBT.
EXCUSE ME, SIR.
[CLICKS HEELS]
MY GOOD FRIEND
THE GALLANT
CAPTAIN VICKERS
ONCE SAVED MY LIFE,
AND AS YOU KNOW,
IN MY COUNTRY,
SIR CHARLES,
FRIENDSHIP CAN BE
CLAIMED BY FRIENDLY
ACTIONS ALONE.
YES. IN THIS
TREACHEROUS LIFE,
IT'S DIFFICULT
TO KNOW WHICH IS FRIEND
AND WHICH IS FOE.
BUT IN THE END,
ONE FINDS OUT,
AND THE WISE MAN
ACTS ACCORDINGLY.
YES.
AHEM. YES.
ARE YOU STAYING LONG
IN CALCUTTA,
YOUR HIGHNESS?
A FEW DAYS, I FANCY,
UNLESS, OF COURSE,
THE, UH...
UNLESS WHAT,
YOUR HIGHNESS?
I SOMETIMES THINK,
SIR CHARLES,
THAT A GREAT
GOVERNMENT RESEMBLES
A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN,
WHO, INTOXICATED
WITH THE POWER
OF HER OWN BEAUTY,
IS APT TO
WITHDRAW FROM
A SINCERE SUITOR
THE FAVORS SHE'S
ALWAYS GRANTED,
AND WHEN SHE FINDS
THIS SUITOR
CONSOLE HIMSELF
WITH ANOTHER BEAUTY,
REGRETS
HER COLDNESS.
INTERESTING. AND WHAT
DOES SHE DO THEN?
SHE CLAIMS THE PRIVILEGE
OF ANY BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
AND CHANGES HER MIND
BEFORE SHE'S LOST
HER SUITOR FOREVER.
DO YOU NOT AGREE?
THE ONLY GREAT GOVERNMENT
I'M ACQUAINTED WITH
IS SINGULARLY MASCULINE.
IT MAKES UP ITS MIND,
AND ONCE HAVING REACHED
A DECISION, ADHERES TO IT.
I'M AFRAID WE'RE
LOSING OURSELVES
IN A FLIGHT
OF FANTASY.
[CHUCKLES]
YES. PERHAPS. YES.
OH, GEOFF.
PERRY, OLD LAD,
HAVE YOU SEEN ELSA?
LADY WARRENTON,
THIS IS MY BROTHER
GEOFFREY.
HOW DO YOU DO?
YOU ARE THE FIANCE
OF THAT EXQUISITE
CHILD. AM I RIGHT?
YOU ARE RIGHT.
CAPITAL.
I CONGRATULATE YOU,
BUT YOU MUST KEEP AN EYE
ON THIS VERY ATTRACTIVE
BROTHER OF YOURS.
I SAW MISS CAMPBELL AND HIM
DANCING TONIGHT.
THE LOOK IN HIS EYE
WAS ANYTHING BUT DIPLOMATIC.
AHA.
BENJI!
MR. VICKERS,
NEVER MARRY A MAN
WITH AN INDIAN LIVER.
LADY WARRENTON,
I WON'T.
BENJI!
THANK HEAVENS.
OH, GEOFFREY,
THERE'S SOMETHING I WANT
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.
OH, THERE'S ELSA NOW.
WAIT A MINUTE, OLD BOY.
ELSA, DARLING,
I'M SORRY I MISSED
SO MANY DANCES.
YOU KNOW HOW
THESE DIPLOMATIC
AFFAIRS ARE.
SHALL WE DANCE NOW?
I'D LOVE TO.
DO YOU MIND, SIR?
NOT AT ALL.
LOOK AROUND YOU.
WHY?
HERE
IN THIS ONE ROOM,
YOU CAN SEE EVERYTHING
THAT MAKES THE WORLD
GO ROUND--
RICHES, INTRIGUE,
AND ALL THE SEEDS
OF MUTINY, WAR,
AND HATRED.
YOU KNOW WHAT IT ALL
MEANS TO ME?
WHAT?
NOTHING.
JUST NOTHING.
YOU'RE
THE ONLY THING
THAT'S REAL HERE.
ALL I KNOW IS
THAT I'M HOLDING YOU
IN MY ARMS
AND THAT...
THAT
YOU'RE SO LOVELY.
OH, GEOFFREY.
ELSA...I LOVE YOU.
[WHISTLING]
HELLO, OLD LAD.
GLAD YOU CAME IN
AND WAITED.
I HAD TO.
MIGHT HAVE MISSED
YOU COMPLETELY.
I'M OFF AGAIN
TOMORROW.
ARE YOU GOING
WITH THE CAMPBELLS
TO CHUKOTI?
NO. WORSE LUCK.
I'M GOING UP
ON THE ARABIAN
FRONTIER
TO BUY A PACK
OF HORSES.
WE NEED PLENTY
OF THEM, YOU KNOW,
AND GOOD ONES.
SOUNDS
LIKE TROUBLE
ON THE BALKANS.
YES. THAT'S
WHAT I THOUGHT, TOO.
I TRIED TO SOUND OUT
OLD MACEFIELD ABOUT IT,
BUT HE CLOSED UP
LIKE AN OYSTER.
HOWEVER, IT MUST BE THAT.
HE TOLD ME TO HURRY,
AND WILL I.
YOU CAN IMAGINE WHY.
GEOFFREY...I...
I'VE NEVER
THANKED YOU FOR ALL
YOU'VE DONE FOR ME.
OH, NONSENSE,
OLD LAD.
YOU'VE BEEN A SUCCESS.
I'M PROUD OF YOU.
BUT SOMETHING'S
HAPPENED.
I KNOW
YOU'LL UNDERSTAND.
WELL, WHAT?
I'VE FALLEN
IN LOVE WITH ELSA.
OH, I'M SORRY, OLD LAD.
HOW ROTTEN FOR YOU.
YES, BUT, GEOFF,
ELSA'S IN LOVE WITH ME.
I DON'T THINK YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.
I DO, UNFORTUNATELY.
WE TRIED NOT TO.
HONESTLY, WE DID,
GEOFF.
I SEE.
MIGHT I ASK
WHAT YOU INTEND
DOING ABOUT IT?
HAS ELSA TOLD YOU
THAT SHE LOVES YOU?
HAS SHE PROMISED
TO MARRY YOU?
YES, BUT NOT
IN SO MANY WORDS.
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.
YOU'RE LYING.
THIS IS SPLENDID.
AFTER SNIVELING
TO ME ABOUT HOW
GRATEFUL HE IS,
MY BROTHER COMES
TO ME AND TELLS ME
HE'S STOLEN
THE AFFECTIONS OF
THE ONE PERSON I LOVE
MOST IN THE WORLD.
BUT NOT CONTENT
WITH THAT,
YOU'VE GOT
THE EFFRONTERY TO
COME HERE AND LIE.
YOU CAN'T
BELIEVE THAT.
LIE AND LIE.
LISTEN...
YOU'D BETTER
GET OUT.
TAKE YOUR DIRTY INTRIGUE
SOMEWHERE ELSE,
BUT GET OUT OF MY SIGHT
AND STAY OUT.
VERY WELL,
BUT LET ME
TELL YOU THIS.
I'VE ALWAYS
LOOKED UP TO YOU,
WORSHIPED YOU
AS A KIND OF GOD.
I FIND YOU'RE RATHER
A LITTLE MAN.
AND AS FAR
AS I'M CONCERNED,
YOU AND OLD CAMPBELL
AND THE WHOLE BLASTED ARMY
CAN GO TO BLAZES.
OH, GOOD MORNING,
SIR.
OH, GEOFFREY.
EARLY VISIT, HUH?
YES, SIR. I JUST HAD
MY ORDERS, AND I'M
SETTING OUT.
I THOUGHT I'D
COME ALONG AND SAY
GOOD-BYE TO YOU.
JUST TO ME?
WELL, SHALL WE SAY
THE FAMILY?
ELSA'S STILL IN HER ROOM,
BUT I'LL CALL HER.
TELL MEMSAHIB SHE'S WANTED
IN THE STUDY IMMEDIATELY.
CAPTAIN VICKERS IS HERE.
[SPEAKING FOREIGN
LANGUAGE]
YOU HAVE
A VERY DIFFICULT JOB
AHEAD OF YOU.
YES, I THINK SO.
BUT I'M SURE
YOU'RE EQUAL TO IT.
THANK YOU, SIR.
SO GOOD-BYE.
GOOD-BYE, SIR.
COME BACK TO US
SAFELY AND SOON.
THANK YOU.
OH, GEOFFREY.
WHAT'S THIS I HEAR?
ARE YOU LEAVING US
SO SOON?
YES, I'M AFRAID SO.
I SUPPOSE THIS IS
WHAT'S KNOWN
AS THE LUCK
OF THE ARMY.
THEY SHOW YOU
A BRIEF GLIMPSE
OF PARADISE
AND THEN
TAKE IT AWAY.
I SUPPOSE, IN TIME,
I'LL LEARN
TO BE GRATEFUL
FOR EVEN A FEW HOURS
WITH YOU.
HOW LONG WILL YOU
BE AWAY?
OH, A MONTH, TWO MONTHS.
HARD TO SAY.
THERE'S SO MUCH TROUBLE
GOING ON EVERYWHERE,
WE'VE GOT TO BE
READY FOR IT
WHEN IT COMES,
BUT AS SOON AS I
COME BACK THIS TIME,
WE'RE NOT GOING
TO LET THE ARMY
OR ANYTHING ELSE
INTERFERE
WITH OUT HAPPINESS,
OUR MARRIAGE,
ARE WE, DARLING?
OF COURSE NOT,
GEOFFREY.
RIGHT.
IT'S A BARGAIN.
GOOD-BYE, MY LOVE.
I'LL HURRY BACK
SO FAST.
OH...
ELSA,
THERE'S SOMETHING...
I THINK I OUGHT
TO TELL YOU
BEFORE I GO.
IT'S RATHER SILLY,
BUT LAST NIGHT
AFTER THE BALL,
PERRY
CAME TO SEE ME.
HE'S IN LOVE
WITH YOU.
YOU KNOW, HE'S
QUITE IMPULSIVE,
AND HE SEEMS
TO BE TAKING THIS
PRETTY SERIOUSLY.
I WAS VERY STUPID
ABOUT IT.
I LOST MY TEMPER
COMPLETELY.
NOW, OF COURSE,
I COULD KICK MYSELF,
BUT I DON'T
WANT HIM TO BE HURT
MORE THAN NECESSARY,
YOU KNOW?
YOU NEEDN'T WORRY, GEOFF.
I SHAN'T BE SEEING PERRY
IN ANY CASE.
FATHER'S BEING SENT
TO CHUKOTI,
AND, OF COURSE,
I'LL GO WITH HIM,
AND PERRY
WILL SOON FORGET.
YES, OF COURSE HE WILL.
THAT'S JUST LIKE YOU,
ELSA, TO UNDERSTAND IT
LIKE THAT.
I MUST GO NOW.
THINK OF ME A LITTLE
WHILE I'M AWAY.
I WILL.
GOOD-BYE
AND GOOD LUCK.
GOOD-BYE, MY LOVE.
THEY'RE MOVING
ALONG FINE.
HOPE WE MISS
THAT STORM
BEHIND US.
HOPE WE MISS
ANY OTHER SORT OF TROUBLE.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND, SIR,
WHY THESE NORTHERN TRIBES
ARE SO HOSTILE.
SINCE TURKEY'S DECLARED WAR
ON RUSSIA,
ALL THESE FELLOWS KNOW
THAT ENGLAND AND FRANCE
ARE BOUND TO COME IN
ON THE SIDE OF TURKEY.
YES. IT'S ALL
VERY COZY.
THESE TRIBESMAN
ARE GOING
TO SYMPATHIZE
WITH THE RUSSIANS.
THAT'S IT,
SO IF WE WANT HORSES,
WE'VE GOT TO PAY
THEIR PRICES...AND LIKE IT.
TROOP, COLUMN LEFT!
RANDALL!
ROUND OUT THAT HERD,
AND LET'S MAKE A START
FOR BATUM.
IT'S 60 MILES TO BATUM.
WE HAND THE HERD
OVER TO THE CAPTAIN
OF THE TRANSPORT FLEET THERE
AND THEN BACK TO INDIA!
THAT'S NOTHING TO BE
SO CHIRPY ABOUT.
YOU'RE DOOMED
TO BE MARRIED SOON,
YOU KNOW.
A MORE PLEASANT DOOM
NEVER FACED
ONE OF THE QUEEN'S MEN.
THIS SICK SENTIMENT.
YOU OUGHT TO BE
DRUMMED OUT OF THE SERVICE
FOR THAT REMARK.
[MAN]
DON'T MIND
HIM, SIR.
I DON'T.
WHERE'D YOU COME FROM?
BE GLAD YOU CAME ALONG
FOR THE RIDE.
IT'S THE SORT OF THING
YOU'D ENJOY--
A REAL PICNIC
WITH EVERYTHING
BUT RED ANTS,
AND I'D RATHER HOPED
FOR SOME ACTION.
[GUNSHOT]
TROOP, HALT!
HERE'S YOUR ACTION.
RANDALL, STAMPEDE THE HERD
THROUGH THAT GORGE.
TROOP, WHEEL MARCH.
GALLOP!
TROOP, DISMOUNT!
TAKE COVER!
GET IN YOUR POSITIONS!
INDEPENDENT FIRE
AS SOON AS YOU'RE UNDER COVER!
[SCREAMING]
WE'RE OUTNUMBERED.
WE CAN'T HOLD ON
MUCH LONGER.
RANDALL, TAKE COMMAND.
IF I'M NOT BACK IN AN HOUR,
TRY TO BREAK THROUGH FOR BATUM.
KEEP FIRING
AS LONG AS YOU CAN.
WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO?
NEVER MIND ABOUT ME.
YOU DO AS I TELL YOU.
HUDSON,
YOU AND BURKE
FOLLOW ME.
YES, SIR.
HERE. FASTEN THIS
TO YOUR POMMEL.
NOW, RIDE OFF DOWN THERE
AND DRAG THIS BUSH
BEHIND YOU.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
TRY TO RAISE ENOUGH DUST
TO MAKE THEM THINK
HALF THE BRITISH ARMY'S
COMING UP TO RELIEVE US.
HURRY!
[YELLING IN
FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
[YELLING IN
FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
[YELLING IN
FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
[YELLING IN

[YELLING IN
FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
ALL RIGHT, BOYS.
FOLD UP YOUR ARMY.
[MEN]
THEY'RE RUNNING!
[MEN REJOICING]
[MAN]
PEARSON, PEARSON,
THERE'S SOMETHING
TO TELL YOUR
GRANDCHILDREN ABOUT
IF YOU
LIVE LONG ENOUGH.
[ALL TALKING AT ONCE]
THERE'S A BAD FELLOW!
IT'S MY TURN.
LET ME
HAVE A SHOT
AT HIM.
WAIT TILL HE GETS
ROUND THE ROCK.
HOLD IT. WAIT.
[GUNSHOT]
CAPTAIN VICKERS!
GEOFFREY, AM I
SEEING THINGS?
WHAT HAPPENED?
THEY THINK THERE'S
A RELIEF FORCE
COMING UP
TO SUPPORT US.
I'M TERRIBLY SORRY,
SIR.
THANK HEAVEN
I MISSED YOU.
YEAH. LUCKY
FOR ME YOU WERE
AIMING AT ME.
GOOD MORNING,
GENTLEMEN.
I'M MORE THAN PLEASED
WITH THE BRILLIANT SUCCESS
OF YOUR EXPEDITION.
CONGRATULATIONS,
MAJOR VICKERS.
MAJOR? WHY,
THANK YOU, SIR.
I HAVEN'T SEEN IT
IN ORDERS YET.
YOU WILL TOMORROW.
CONGRATULATIONS,
CAPTAIN RANDALL.
THANK YOU, SIR.
SHALL I SEE IT
IN ORDERS, TOO, SIR?
YES, OF COURSE.
SIR.
I'M AFRAID YOU'LL HAVE
TO WAIT A BIT, PEARSON,
BUT GOOD WORK
ALL THE SAME.
NOW, WHAT DO YOU ALL SAY
ABOUT GOING BACK
TO CHUKOTI?
WE NEED
SEASONED OFFICERS
UP THERE.
I WOULD LIKE IT IMMENSELY,
PERSONALLY, SIR.
HE'S GOING TO BE
MARRIED SOON, SIR.
SO I UNDERSTAND.
WELL, WE'LL SEE
WHAT WE CAN DO
ABOUT GETTING YOU
AN EXTENDED LEAVE
LATER ON.
WHY,
THANK YOU, SIR.
WELL, THANK YOU,
GENTLEMEN.
PERRY.
[PERRY]
YOU SENT FOR ME, SIR?
PERRY, YES. SIT DOWN.
MAKE YOURSELF COMFORTABLE,
WON'T YOU?
THANK YOU, SIR.
THE VICKERS ARE
AN OLD ARMY FAMILY.
YES, SIR.
I KNEW YOUR FATHER
AT ZANDA, PERRY.
YOU AND YOUR BROTHER
GEOFFREY HAVE COME
ALONG ADMIRABLY,
THOUGH AS BROTHERS,
I EXPECT YOU'VE HAD
YOUR LITTLE DIFFERENCES.
HMM?
YOU KNOW,
BROTHERS RARELY AVOID
THESE LITTLE THINGS...
BUT THEY'RE
USUALLY TRIFLES.
TRIFLES, SIR?
CERTAINLY.
DON'T YOU THINK SO?
WELL, THAT IS, IT'S
RATHER DIFFICULT
TO EXPLAIN,
BUT, DON'T YOU
THINK, SIR,
WE'RE ENTITLED
TO SETTLE
OUR OWN PROBLEMS
IN OUR OWN WAY?
YES. YES, PERHAPS SO.
NOW, GOVERNOR GENERAL
DELHAUSSY
REQUIRES THE PRESENCE
OF A POLITICAL MAN
ON THE FRONTIER
TO HANDLE THE SURISTANI
SITUATION.
I'VE SELECTED YOU.
YOU MEAN I'M TO GO
UP TO CHUKOTI, SIR?
NO. YOU'LL BE
STATIONED AT LOHARA.
CHUKOTI WILL BE
THE SPEARHEAD OF ANY
POSSIBLE MILITARY MANEUVERS,
BUT YOUR DUTIES
WILL BE THOSE
OF AN OFFICIAL OBSERVER.
IS THAT FINAL, SIR?
I MEAN, THAT I'M
TO GO UP TO LOHARA?
FINAL. YOU'LL HAVE
SO MUCH WORK TO DO THERE
THAT YOU WON'T HAVE TIME
TO THINK OF ANYTHING ELSE.
YOU'LL LEAVE
WITH A CARAVAN
IN THE MORNING.
THAT'S ALL.
YES, SIR.
I UNDERSTAND, SIR.
PERRY. I'M SORRY
ABOUT THE WAY THINGS
HAVE GONE, OLD LAD.
ELSA CAN'T LOVE
BOTH OF US,
YOU KNOW.
I'M AWARE OF THAT.
WELL, THEN...
LOOK HERE, GEOFFREY.
WE MIGHT AS WELL
GET THIS THING SETTLED
ONCE AND FOR ALL.
WE'RE NOT FRIENDS,
SO WHY PRETEND WE ARE?
ALL THE CARDS
ARE STACKED ON YOUR SIDE--
OLD CAMBPELL'S FOR YOU,
THE FACT THAT YOU
GOT THERE FIRST,
EVERYTHING.
I'VE ONLY ONE CLAIM--
ELSA HAPPENS TO LOVE ME,
AND ONLY ME,
AND AS LONG
AS THAT'S TRUE,
I'M GOING TO FIGHT ANYONE.
PERRY, I KNOW
YOU'RE WRONG.
WE CAN'T LET
SOMETHING LIKE THIS
COME BETWEEN US NOW,
AND BESIDES, YOU--
I'LL GET OVER IT.
I KNOW.
WELL, GET THIS
INTO YOUR HEAD.
I'M OLD ENOUGH TO KNOW
MY OWN MIND AND ELSA'S.
I WOULDN'T
HANG ON TO ANYONE
WHO DIDN'T LOVE ME. I--
[MAN]
THIS IS WHERE WE
TURN OFF FOR CHUKOTI. VICKERS!
COMING.
PERRY, OLD LAD--
THERE'S NOTHING MORE
TO SAY.
[MAN]
TROOP, COLUMN LEFT!
[BUGLING]
[MAN SHOUTING ORDERS]
EYES LEFT.
HALT!
REPORTING OUR RETURN
FROM CALCUTTA, SIR.
GOOD, MAJOR VICKERS.
ANY CASUALTIES?
YES, SIR.
ONE MAN WOUNDED.
WE WERE FIRED ON
SEVERAL TIMES,
BUT WE EXPECTED THAT.
DID YOU RETURN FIRE?
NO, SIR.
I'M GLAD YOU DIDN'T.
SIR BENJAMIN'S ORDERS
ARE TO MAINTAIN PEACE.
PRETTY DIFFICULT ORDERS
TO FOLLOW, SIR,
PARTICULARLY WHEN
THEY'RE FIRING ON US.
YES. WHEN YOU'VE
BEEN SOLDIERING
AS LONG AS I HAVE,
YOU'LL UNDERSTAND
IT'S BEST TO FOLLOW
INSTRUCTIONS REGARDLESS.
YES, SIR.
BY THE WAY,
IT WOULD BE DISGRACEFUL
FOR AN OFFICER
TO APPEAR BEFORE HIS
COMMANDANT'S DAUGHTER
IN SUCH A CONDITION.
RUN ALONG
AND CLEAN UP
AND COME BACK
TO MY OFFICE.
YES, SIR.
TROOP,
FACE LEFT ABOUT!
WALK MARCH!
ASK MISS CAMPBELL
TO COME TO MY OFFICE
IMMEDIATELY.
HALT!
FALL OUT THE OFFICERS.
PREPARE TO DISMOUNT!
DISMOUNT!
DISMISSED.
CAPTAIN SAHIB!
PREMA!
UP YOU GO.
THANK YOU, SAHIB.
LOOK, I BROUGHT YOU BACK
A NEW SALUTE.
WATCH.
HOW DO YOU DO IT?
LIKE THIS.
TRY IT ON THE GENERAL.
WELL, MISS CAMPBELL
LEFT WITH THE FIRST PATROL
THIS MORNING, SIR.
CONFOUND IT!
WELL, UH, YES.
THAT'S ALL.
THAT'S ALL.
WHY DIDN'T ELSA
TELL ME OF THIS?
THAT GIRL'S
A COMPLETE MYSTERY
TO ME. OUTRAGEOUS!
SHE KNEW
PERFECTLY WELL YOU
WERE ARRIVING TODAY.
PARDON, SIR?
ELSA LEFT FOR LOHARA
THIS MORNING.
LADY WARRENTON
MIGHT BE ILL, SIR.
SHE MIGHT HAVE SENT FOR HER.
NOT THAT I'M AWARE OF,
AND WHAT IF SHE WERE?
THAT'S NO EXCUSE.
[LADY WARRENTON]
YOU DON'T MEAN TO TELL ME--
WELL, YOU MUST HAVE HAD
A LONG AND TIRESOME JOURNEY.
A NICE CUP OF HOT TEA
WILL REALLY REFRESH YOU,
MY DEAR.
I'LL NEVER FORGET MY
APPALLING HONEYMOON TRIP
WITH DARLING BENJI.
YOU REMEMBER, DEAR?
BENJI!
YES, DEAR? BE WITH YOU
IN A MINUTE, DEAR.
HERE'S SOME NICE COLD WATER
TO TAKE WITH YOUR PILL.
I THOUGHT I MIGHT
DRINK A LITTLE TOAST
TO OUR DELIGHTFUL GUEST.
KEEP ME AWAKE ALL NIGHT?
WELL, YOU'RE WRONG AGAIN.
I HOPE
YOU AND SIR BENJAMIN
DIDN'T MIND MY COMING
UNINVITED LIKE THIS.
CERTAINLY NOT.
DELIGHTED.
MIND?
WE'RE ENCHANTED.
BY THE WAY, HOW IS THAT
RAVISHINGLY HANDSOME
FIANCE OF YOURS?
YOUNG VICKERS.
DUE HERE TODAY.
NO, BENJI,
YOU'RE ALL MUDDLED.
ELSA IS ENGAGED
TO THE OTHER BROTHER,
GODFREY.
GEOFFREY, DEAR.
SOME CAKE?
NO, THANK YOU.
SO THE BROTHER IS COMING.
WELL, WELL, WELL.
THAT IS A COINCIDENCE.
MY DEAR, YOU REMEMBER
THE APPALLING BALL
IN CALCUTTA?
WELL, I WAS CONVINCED
THAT YOU AND HE WERE, UH...
SO TO SPEAK.
[SIR BENJAMIN]
PAY NO ATTENTION TO
MY WIFE, MISS CAMPBELL.
SHE HAS TWO OBSESSIONS
IN LIFE--
GIVING ME PILLS
AND SCANDALOUS INTRIGUE.
CAPTAIN VICKERS,
SAHIB.
THANK YOU.
LADY WARRENTON.
GLAD TO SEE YOU,
VICKERS.
SIR BENJAMIN.
ELSA! WHY,
THIS IS A SURPRISE.
HOW ARE YOU, PERRY?
[SIR BENJAMIN]
GOOD TRIP,
MY BOY?
DON'T BE ABSURD, BENJI.
THERE'S NO SUCH THING
AS A GOOD TRIP IN INDIA.
ONE EITHER TRAVELS IN
COMPARATIVE DISCOMFORT
OR IN COMPLETE DISCOMFORT.
MINE WAS COMPLETE.
YOU TWO CHILDREN
WANT TO BE ALONE, I KNOW.
YOU MUST TELL ELSA
ALL ABOUT GODFREY.
GEOFFREY, DEAR.
ALL ABOUT YOUR BROTHER,
THOUGH, WHY YOU'RE NOT
GREEN WITH JEALOUSY OF HIM
FOR ANNEXING THIS ADORABLE
CREATURE, I CAN'T IMAGINE.
COME, BENJI.
OH, PLEASE DON'T
DISTURB YOURSELF,
LADY WARRENTON.
ELSA AND I
WILL TAKE A STROLL.
SHALL WE?
YES.
NO, NO, NO.
NOT OUT THERE.
NOT ON THE VERANDA.
THERE. IN
THE SUMMER HOUSE...
WHERE THE BIRDS
ARE SINGING
AND THE FLOWERS
ARE BURGEONING.
ACROSS THE VERANDA
AND DOWN THE WALK.
REALLY, OCTAVIA.
YOUR CONSTANT INNUENDOS
ARE INTOLERABLE.
YOU FULLY EMBARRASSED
YOUNG VICKERS
AND THE CAMPBELL GIRL,
NOT TO MENTION ME.
WHY CAN'T YOU RESIST
POKING YOUR NOSE
INTO OTHER PEOPLE'S
PRIVATE AFFAIRS?
IS NOTHING SACRED
TO YOU?
YES, BENJI, DEAR.
YOUR LIVER.
IT'S WONDERFUL OF YOU
TO COME HERE LIKE THIS.
WHEN I SAW YOU JUST NOW,
I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT
POSSIBLE.
WHY DID YOU
TAKE SUCH A RISK?
I HAD TO.
I'VE TRIED TO FORCE MYSELF
TO FORGET YOU.
I'VE EVEN TRIED
TO HATE YOU,
BUT I LOVE YOU.
I ALWAYS HAVE,
AND I ALWAYS SHALL.
DARLING.
POOR FATHER.
YOU SEE, HE'S RIGHT
FROM HIS POINT OF VIEW.
HE MADE ME PROMISE
TO TRY TO GET OVER IT.
I DID TRY...
FOR THREE MONTHS,
BUT I FAILED,
SO I THREW AWAY
ALL COMMON SENSE
AND CAME HERE TO YOU
TO MAKE SURE THAT--
THAT YOU'RE READY
TO FACE EVERYTHING WITH ME.
MY LOVE FOR YOU
IS EVEN STRONGER,
MORE A PART OF ME
THAN EVER.
I WAS SURE OF IT.
TOMORROW I MUST GO
BACK TO CHUKOTI
AND TELL
FATHER AND GEOFFREY
THAT WHATEVER HAPPINESS
THERE IS IN ME TO GIVE
MUST BE GIVEN TO YOU.
PARADES, LEFT!
TROOP, HALT!
[BUGLING]
STABLES. COMING?
PARADE LEFT,
COLUMN LEFT. MARCH!
REPORT THE RETURN
OF THE CONVOY, SIR.
VERY GOOD.
SIR BENJAMIN'S
COMPLIMENTS, SIR.
YOU'VE HAD A SCRAP.
WE WERE FIRED UPON
BY THE SURISTANIS
IN KOHRUD PASS.
WELL, YOU HAD
YOUR ORDERS?
YES, SIR. MY PATROL
WITHDREW IN GOOD ORDER,
BUT WE LOST A MAN--
LANCER WENTWORTH.
WENTWORTH?
THAT'S ALL, BARCLAY.
ANYTHING ELSE?
WELL, SIR. THE KHAN--
THAT IS, IF I MAY...
YES, OF COURSE.
GO ON.
WELL, YOU SEE, SIR, WE RAN
ACROSS A CARAVAN COMING
DOWN FROM THE PASS.
THERE WAS A HINDU MERCHANT.
HE'D JUST BEEN
TO VISIT THE SURISTANIS,
AND HE HAS IT ON GOOD AUTHORITY
THAT THE SURISTANIS ARE
PREPARING FOR AN ATTACK.
AN ATTACK?
YES, SIR.
ON CHUKOTI.
OH, COME,
COME, NOW, BARCLAY.
THE KHAN WOULDN'T DARE.
YOU MUST BE MISTAKEN.
THAT'S ALL.
YES, SIR.
SOLDIERS...
OLD WOMEN, THAT'S WHAT.
I FEEL
THAT BARCLAY'S
INFORMATION
IS ACCURATE, SIR.
WHAT, YOU ALSO?
ALL RIGHT.
PRESUMING IT IS.
WHY THIS GARRISON?
WHY CHUKOTI?
ANSWER ME THAT, VICKERS.
THE KHAN'S
WISE ENOUGH
TO KNOW, SIR,
THAT AN ATTACK
ON CHUKOTI NOW
WILL IGNITE
THE ENTIRE FRONTIER.
WHY,
THE INFERNAL SCOUNDREL.
THEN HE MUST KNOW
THE HOME GOVERNMENT'S
FEELINGS ABOUT A BORDER WAR.
THAT'S IT EXACTLY, SIR.
ALSO THE FACT THAT
ENGLAND'S ABOUT TO
GO TO WAR WITH RUSSIA.
ATTACK NOW, SIR.
STRIKE THE FIRST BLOW,
AND YOU'LL CRUSH HIM.
VICKERS,
YOU WILL PARADE YOUR MEN
IN FULL MARCHING ORDER,
READY TO MOVE OFF
AT ONCE.
YES, SIR.
[BUGLING]
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
GOOD-BYE, MARY.
COMPANY...MARCH!
TROOPS ARE READY
TO MOVE OFF, SIR.
[CAMPBELL]
STAND AT EASE, GENTLEMEN.
I HAVE RECEIVED
THE FOLLOWING FROM
GENERAL HEADQUARTERS--
"TO THE OFFICER
COMMANDING CHUKOTI
GARRISON,
"UPON RECEIPT
OF THIS ORDER,
"YOU WILL DISPATCH
ALL AVAILABLE MEN
UNDER YOUR COMMAND
TO BRIGADE HEADQUARTERS,
LOHARA, TO TAKE PART
IN MANEUVERS."
MANEUVERS?
AT THIS TIME, SIR?
SIR BENJAMIN'S ORDERS, VICKERS.
HE KNOWS MORE OF THE SITUATION
THAN WE DO.
MAJOR JOWETT,
YOU WILL BE IN COMMAND
OF THE TROOPS.
CAPTAIN CARY,
CORNET GORDON,
CORNET BARCLAY
WILL GO WITH YOU.
THE REST OF YOU
WILL REMAIN
IN THE GARRISON.
THOSE ARE MY ORDERS
FROM SIR BENJAMIN.
THAT'S ALL, GENTLEMEN.
BEG YOUR PARDON,
SIR.
YES. WHAT IS IT?
SENDING THE MEN OFF
TO LOHARA
ON MANEUVERS NOW
LEAVES US WITH
HARDLY ONE COMPANY
OF INFANTRY HERE.
OBVIOUSLY, IT'S
STRATEGIC TO PUT ON
A DISPLAY OF FORCE
FOR THE SURISTANI
TRIBES.
MORE EFFECTIVE
THAN BULLETS.
BUT THAT LEAVES
CHUKOTI ALMOST
ENTIRELY UNDEFENDED.
BOLDNESS. THAT, MY BOY,
IS THE ESSENCE
OF STRATEGY.
BUT THE WOMEN
AND CHILDREN, SIR.
JOWETT'S WIFE
AND CHILD, ELSA,
THE SEPOYS'
FAMILIES.
NOTHING TO WORRY
ABOUT.
WE HAVE PLENTY OF MEN
LEFT HERE
TO DEFEND THEM.
WE HAVEN'T
ENOUGH MEN LEFT.
YOU CAN'T TAKE--
MAJOR VICKERS,
YOU'VE HAD YOUR ORDERS.
I'VE HAD MINE.
THAT'S ALL.
YES, SIR.
PARADE RIGHT!
PARADE RIGHT!
PARADE RIGHT!
PARADE RIGHT!
FORWARD MARCH!
ELSA.
OH, IT'S YOU,
GEOFFREY.
I'M SORRY.
I DIDN'T MEAN
TO STARTLE YOU.
YOU LOOKED
VERY FAR AWAY
JUST THEN.
WHAT WERE YOU
THINKING OF?
OF A PEACEFUL
COUNTRYSIDE,
OF SOFT GREEN DOWNS
ROLLING TO A BLUE SEA.
I KNOW. ENGLAND.
NO HOT, BURNING SUN.
NO ETERNAL TREACHERY
WAITING
FOR THE UNKNOWN.
ENGLAND.
IN EARLY SPRINGTIME.
ASCOT, CRICKET,
PUNTING
ON THE THAMES.
WE'LL SEE ALL THAT
TOGETHER ONE DAY.
JUST NOW IT...
SEEMS RATHER LIKE
AN INTANGIBLE DREAM.
LITTLE LIKE YOU,
ELSA.
YOU SEE...
I WAS RATHER HOPING
YOU'D BE HERE
WHEN I GOT BACK.
I WAS AT LOHARA.
YES, I KNOW.
YOUR FATHER TOLD ME.
THERE WAS SOMETHING
I HAD TO FIND OUT,
SOMETHING
I HAD TO BE SURE OF
BEFORE I SAW YOU.
YOU FOUND OUT?
YES.
GEOFFREY, YOU WANT
TO MAKE ME HAPPY?
MORE THAN ANYTHING
ELSE IN THE WORLD.
THEN YOU MUST KNOW
EVERYTHING.
I CAME
BACK FROM LOHARA
DETERMINED TO
TELL YOU THAT--
[BULLET RICOCHETS]
MAJOR SAHIB!
MAJOR SAHIB!
MAJOR SAHIB!
TOWER GUARD SHOT!
SURISTANI.
MAJOR SAHIB.
SOUND THE ALARM!
TURN OUT THE GUARD
DOUBLE QUICK!
VICKERS,
WHAT'S HAPPENING?
WE'RE BEING
ATTACKED, SIR.
SURISTANI?
YES, SIR.
CONCENTRATE
YOUR STRENGTH
ON THE MAIN GATE.
SEND 15 MEN
TO THE EAST WALL.
ORDERLY!
OPEN FIRE AS SOON AS
YOU'RE WITHIN RANGE!
CORNET!
YES, SIR!
TAKE 15 MEN
AND MOUNT
THE EAST WALL!
[BABY CRYING]
RAPID FIRE!
WE'RE LOSING
TOO MANY MEN, SIR!
YES. WE'RE HOPELESSLY
OUTNUMBERED.
WE'D BETTER ABANDON
THE WALL BEFORE
IT'S TOO LATE.
THE BARRACKS, SIR.
WE CAN HOLD THEM OFF
FROM THERE
AND GET THEM AS
THEY COME OVER THE WALL.
GIVE ORDERS
TO ABANDON THE WALL.
BUGLER, SOUND THE RETREAT.
TAKE COVER IN THE BARRACKS, MEN!
TAKE COVER IN THE BARRACKS!
QUICK, MEN!
GET ALL YOUR WOUNDED
TO THE MEDICAL OFFICER!
GET THE DOORS
AND WINDOWS!
[GEOFFREY]
BARRICADE THE DOORS
AND WINDOWS!
ELSA, GET ALL
THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN
AWAY FROM THE LINE
OF THE WINDOWS, QUICK.
[WOMAN SHOUTS]
MAMA!
RANDALL!
YES, HERE.
TAKE SIX MEN
AND REINFORCE THE REAR.
ISSUE MORE AMMUNITION
ALL AROUND. QUICK.
YES, SIR. FIRST SIX MEN,
FOLLOW ME.
THIS WAY. HURRY!
HOLD THESE WINDOWS
AND COVER AN ATTACK
FROM THE STABLES.
MAKE EVERY SHOT TELL,
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
AMMUNITIONEER,
READY TO INTERCHANGE RIFLES.
VICKERS,
HOW MUCH AMMUNITION
HAVE WE LEFT?
PLENTY, SIR.
THAT'S THE LEAST
OF OUR TROUBLES.
IT'S WATER THAT'S
THE MAIN PROBLEM, SIR.
WATER AND THIS HEAT.
WE'VE GOT TO REACH
JOWETT AT LOHARA.
SOMEONE'S GOT TO
GET THROUGH TO THEM.
NOW IS YOUR CHANCE.
THE MOON'S GOING
BEHIND SOME CLOUDS.
NOW, DON'T FORGET.
WHEN YOU REACH
THE RIVER,
CUT A NATIVE BOAT
LOOSE,
AND THE CURRENT
WILL CARRY YOU DOWN
TO LOHARA.
THAT'S
EASY ENOUGH, SIR.
I'LL HAVE THE TROOPS
BACK IN NO TIME.
THAT'S THE SPIRIT.
NOW, WITH
ANY LUCK AT ALL,
YOU SHOULD GET OVER.
THERE'S
VERY FEW MARKSMEN
HOLDING THE WALL.
LOOKS PRETTY CLEAR.
YES.
GEOFFREY, LOOK.
YOU WOULDN'T MIND
GIVING THIS
TO MY FAMILY
JUST IN CASE?
LOOKS LIKE
A PRETTY CHEAP ONE.
DOES IT GO?
IF YOU WIND IT UP.
YOU'RE AN IDIOT.
ALL RIGHT.
I'LL GIVE IT BACK
TO YOU TOMORROW.
THANKS, OLD PAL.
GOOD LUCK.
COME, MY BOY.
OVER YOU GO.
GOD BE WITH YOU.
THANK YOU, SIR.
[GEOFFREY]
YOU READY?
YEAH.
HE'S OVER THE WALL.
IN THIS CHANGING MOON,
THE KHAN WON'T DARE
TO MAKE ANOTHER ATTACK.
THANK GOD FOR HIS
EVERLASTING MERCY.
YOU LOOK
AS THOUGH
YOU COULD DO
WITH
A FEW HOURS'
SLEEP, SIR.
OH, YES.
PERHAPS YOU'RE RIGHT.
SUN'S UP, SIR.
YES.
WE CAN'T HOLD OUT
MUCH LONGER, SIR.
[MAN]
MAJOR VICKERS, SIR. LOOK.
THEY'RE GONE.
THEY'RE GONE, SIR.
[GUNSHOT]
PEARSON,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
ARE YOU MAD?
BUT DON'T YOU
SEE THEM?
THEY'RE COMING
OVER THE WALL.
THEY'RE
COMING THROUGH
THE COMPOUND.
I CAN'T STOP THEM.
SHUT UP! STOP!
I--I--I--
SHUT UP!
THAT'S ALL RIGHT,
OLD FELLA.
PULL YOURSELF
TOGETHER.
I'M SORRY, SIR.
[SOBS]
THE WALLS ARE
ALL DESERTED, SIR.
THAT'S VERY STRANGE.
POSSIBLY SOME SORT
OF A TRICK.
RUN UPSTAIRS
AND LOOK AROUND
CAREFULLY.
WHITE FLAG, SIR.
WHAT?
THEY'RE COMING
TOWARDS US NOW
OVER THE HILL.
WHAT THE DEVIL
ARE THEY UP TO NOW?
WE'LL SOON SEE.
REMOVE THE BARRICADE.
OPEN THAT DOOR.
HIS HIGHNESS,
SURAT KHAN,
AMIR OF SURISTAN,
SENDS GREETINGS
TO HIS EXCELLENCY
THE COMMANDANT
OF CHUKOTI
AND HUMBLY
PROPOSES A TRUCE,
WITH A REQUEST
THAT YOU WILL SEND
MAJOR VICKERS
TO DISCUSS
THE TERMS.
EXCELLENT.
HE'S PROBABLY MISSED
A BOAT FROM ITS MOORINGS
AND SUSPECTS OUR MAN
GOT THROUGH
AND IS READY
TO TREAT WITH US.
I'D BETTER GO, SIR.
YES, OF COURSE.
WE ACCEPT HIS HIGHNESS'
SUGGESTION
ONLY ON THE CONDITION
THAT WE HOLD YOU
AS HOSTAGE
PENDING MAJOR VICKERS'
SAFE RETURN.
I'M SURE HIS HIGHNESS
WILL BE GRACIOUSLY
PLEASED
AND WILL UNDERSTAND
YOUR NATURAL CAUTION.
VERY WELL.
YOU'LL ACCOMPANY ME
AS ORDERLY.
YES, SIR.
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
I WELCOME YOU,
MAJOR VICKERS.
MAY THE GODS
OF COURAGE AND WISDOM
CONTINUE TO BESTOW
THEIR BLESSINGS ON YOU.
YOUR HIGHNESS,
I MUST SUGGEST
YOU COME STRAIGHT
TO THE POINT.
REALLY?
YOU PROBABLY KNOW
BY NOW THAT WORD
HAS REACHED LOHARA,
AND THE ENTIRE
BRIGADE'S
ON ITS WAY HERE.
HOW INTERESTING.
OH, IT PAINS ME
DEEPLY
TO HAVE TO DISILLUSION
YOU ON THAT SCORE.
IF IT'S THAT SEPOY
YOU MEAN--
YES.
CAPTAIN RANDALL.
OH, SO IT WAS
CAPTAIN RANDALL
WHO SO IMPRUDENTLY
ATTEMPTED TO PENETRATE
THE LINES.
POOR FELLOW.
HE PAID THE PENALTY
FOR HIS FOOLISHNESS.
HE'S...HE'S DEAD?
OH, MY FRIEND,
LIFE IS SWEET AND DEAR
WHEN ONE CANNOT HAVE IT.
THAT'S WHY I SENT
FOR YOU.
I'M OFFERING YOU
YOUR LIFE.
MY LIFE. WHY?
YOU SAVED MINE,
AND I SHALL NEVER
FORGET IT.
YOU WILL BE GIVEN
A HORSE AND SAFE CONDUCT--
YOUR HIGHNESS,
UP TILL NOW
THE HOME GOVERNMENT
HAS CHOSEN
TO DISREGARD
SUNDRY UNFRIENDLY
ACTS OF YOURS.
BY WITHDRAWING
YOUR FORCES NOW,
YOU'LL BE MAKING
A FRIENDLY GESTURE
WHICH WILL ALMOST
CERTAINLY LEAD
TO THE REOPENING
OF NEGOTIATIONS
IN CALCUTTA.
YOU'RE NOT FIGHTING
A SINGLE OUTPOST.
YOU'RE FIGHTING
THE ENTIRE
BRITISH ARMY.
YOUR LOGIC,
MY DEAR MAJOR,
IS OVERWHELMING.
NO, MY FRIEND.
I DO NOT THINK
YOU SERIOUSLY BELIEVE
THAT I'LL ACCEPT
YOUR OPTIMISTIC
SUGGESTIONS.
AFTER ALL, HAVE YOU
NOT AN ENGLISH PROVERB
TO THE EFFECT
THAT POSSESSION
IS 9/10 OF THE LAW?
THEN I TAKE IT
THERE'S NOTHING MORE
TO BE SAID.
ON THE CONTRARY,
IF WE ARE OPEN
AND HONEST
WITH ONE ANOTHER,
THIS MATTER CAN BE
SETTLED REASONABLY.
ANY SUGGESTION
YOU MAKE MUST
GUARANTEE THE SAFETY
OF THE WOMEN
AND CHILDREN.
THEN THE OBVIOUS
SOLUTION WOULD BE
AN EVACUATION.
EVACUATION?
YOU MEAN SURRENDER?
HARDLY. I AM
PERFECTLY WILLING
TO GRANT THE GARRISON
A SAFE ESCORT
TO LOHARA.
WHY, I'VE EVERY
REASON TO SUPPOSE
THAT WILL BE
PERFECTLY
SATISFACTORY.
WHEN I WENT TO SCHOOL
IN ENGLAND,
I LEARNED YOUR CHARMING
CUSTOM OF SHAKING HANDS,
SIGNIFYING THE COMPLETION
OF A BARGAIN
BETWEEN TWO GENTLEMEN.
OF COURSE, THE GARRISON
WILL HAVE TO LAY DOWN
ITS ARMS.
WHAT? BUT WHY?
AS A FRIENDLY GESTURE.
THAT'S UTTERLY
IMPOSSIBLE.
IT PLACES US
ENTIRELY
AT YOUR MERCY.
AHEM. WE UNDERSTAND
THEIR FEELINGS,
YOUR HIGHNESS.
VERY WELL, THEN.
WITH ARMS.
I'M SORRY.
I WON'T AGREE
TO YOUR TERMS
UNDER ANY CONDITIONS
WHATEVER.
TAKE MY OFFER
TO YOUR COMMANDANT.
THE DECISION IS HIS.
IF MY TERMS
ARE ACCEPTABLE,
INSTRUCT YOUR COLONEL
TO RAISE THE WHITE FLAG.
YOU SHOULD KNOW
THE BRITISH
NEVER SURRENDER,
YET THEIR GUNS WILL
BE USELESS TO THEM,
IF I MAY ADVISE
YOUR HIGHNESS.
I SUSPECTED YOU HAD
A PLAN.
PRECISELY.
IF COLONEL CAMPBELL
ACCEPTS OUR TERMS--
AND HE WOULD BE
EXCEEDINGLY UNWISE
NOT TO--
IT WOULD BE
VERY SIMPLE.
I WISH YOU'D
THINK IT OVER
AGAIN, SIR.
I FEEL
WE'RE MAKING
A GRAVE MISTAKE
IN ACCEPTING
THE KHAN'S TERMS.
IT PUTS US ENTIRELY
AT HIS MERCY.
WELL, WE'RE PRACTICALLY
AT HIS MERCY ALREADY.
I'M SURE YOU'RE
QUITE MISTAKEN
IN YOUR SUSPICIONS.
CAN YOU GIVE ME
ANY TANGIBLE REASON?
NO, SIR, EXCEPT
THAT THEY OFFERED ME
A HORSE
AND A SAFE CONDUCT
FOR MYSELF ONLY.
NO, I SEE NO REASON
TO MISTRUST HIM.
BESIDES,
I'VE GOT TO THINK OF
THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN.
THAT'S JUST IT, SIR.
WE CAN'T TRUST HIM.
WELL, WE'VE GOT TO
GO THROUGH WITH IT.
ALL RIGHT, GET TO THE FIRST
AND SECOND BOAT THERE.
[SPEAKING
FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
GET THE PEOPLE
LOADED INTO THE BOATS
AS SOON AS YOU CAN,
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
AND YOU TAKE
THE LEADING BOAT
TO LOHARA.
PUT THAT STRETCHER
ON THE RAFT THERE.
[SPEAKING
FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
[BABY CRIES]
CAREFUL! DON'T
OVERLOAD THAT BOAT!
[SPEAKING
FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
[SCREAMING]
OUT OF THE BOATS.
QUICKLY, NOW!
MASSACRE!
HE'S SAFE.
MY DEBT TO MAJOR VICKERS
IS PAID.
[SPEAKING
FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
DRIVE THE REST OF THEM
BACK INTO THE GARRISON!
DOES IT FEEL
BETTER NOW?
YES, MUCH.
THANK YOU.
WE SHOULDN'T
HAVE TRUSTED HIM.
THOSE POOR
LITTLE KIDS.
HORRIBLE.
WHAT'S GOING
TO HAPPEN TO THEM?
HE CAN'T MURDER
THEM ALL.
NO. THAT WOULD
BE TOO MUCH,
EVEN FOR
THE KHAN.
HE'LL HOLD THEM
AS HOSTAGES.
THAT'S WHY WE'VE
GOT TO GET TO
LOHARA FOR HELP.
IT'S
OUR ONLY HOPE.
LOOK.
IT'S OUR CHANCE.
"...BEEN OUR REFUGE
FROM ONE GENERATION TO ANOTHER.
"THOU TURNEST MEN
TO DESTRUCTION.
AGAIN THOU SAYEST, COME AGAIN,
YE CHILDREN OF MEN..."
[MAN SPEAKING
FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
"THE DAYS OF OUR AGE
ARE 3 SCORE YEARS AND 10,
"AND THOUGH MEN BE SO STRONG
"THAT THEY COME
TO FOURSCORE YEARS,
"YET IS THEIR STRENGTH
THEN BUT LABOR AND SORROW,
"SO SOON PASSETH IT AWAY
AND WE ARE GONE.
TURN THEE AGAIN, O LORD..."
[SHOUTING
IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
MAJOR VICKERS!
WHAT ON EARTH
ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT?
WELL, WHERE
DID THIS HAPPEN?
JUST NOW, SIR,
DOWN BY THE RIVER
AT THE NORTH GATE.
WHAT'S THE MEANING
OF ALL THIS?
MISS CAMPBELL!
GEOFFREY!
ALI!
TELL LADY WARRENTON
MISS CAMPBELL
NEEDS HER HELP AT ONCE.
MY DEAR.
GO WITH CATARO.
SHE'LL TAKE YOU TO
MY WIFE AT ONCE.
GEOFFREY, MY BOY,
THIS IS TERRIBLE.
HOW ON EARTH
DID IT HAPPEN?
CHUKOTI, SIR.
THE SURISTANIS
ATTACKED.
HOT WATER AND CLOTHES.
GET SMELLING SALTS.
MY POOR, POOR CHILD!
I THOUGHT
THE BEST THING
WE COULD DO
WOULD BE TO TRY
AND REACH HERE
FOR HELP.
CHANCES ARE, WE WILL
GET THERE IN TIME?
YES, IF WE HURRY.
CAPTAIN BARNES.
REQUEST MAJOR JOWETT
TO REPORT TO ME
AT ONCE
AND SOUND ASSEMBLY.
VERY GOOD, SIR.
THE KHAN MUST BE
HOLDING THE WOMEN
AND CHILDREN.
YES, AS HOSTAGES,
OF COURSE.
WE'VE NO TIME
TO SPARE.
PACK THE SEPOYS
IN THEIR OWN
TRANSPORT WAGONS.
WE'LL BRING THEM
ALONG WITH US.
GEOFFREY, YOU GET
YOUR ARM ATTENDED TO
AT ONCE.
I'LL BE WITH YOU
IN A MINUTE.
DO YOU MIND
IF I COME ALONG?
NO, OLD LAD.
WE'LL NEED YOU.
HALT!
THAT'S STRANGE!
THE WHITE FLAG'S
STILL FLYING.
THERE ARE NO
SENTRIES ABOUT.
SHOWS EVERY SIGN
OF BEING DESERTED.
WHAT DO YOU
MAKE OF IT?
WHO KNOWS, SIR?
MAJOR JOWETT?
TAKE FORWARD A DETAIL
IN SKIRMISHING ORDER.
VERY GOOD, SIR.
THE LAST SIX SECTIONS
DISMOUNT
AND ADVANCE
IN SKIRMISHING ORDER!
I WONDER IF
THIS IS ANOTHER OF
THE KHAN'S TRICKS.
FIRE A SHOT.
[GUNSHOT]
NO SIGN OF LIFE.
TROOP, FORWARD. GALLOP!
OH, YARA! PREMA!
MEZANTI!
THERE SHE IS
ON THE STEPS, SIR.
NAN!
JOHN.
[CRYING]
YARA...
YARA, COME.
THEY'RE DEAD! THEY'RE ALL DEAD!
CAN'T YOU HEAR ME?
THEY'RE DEAD, I TELL YOU!
THEY'RE DEAD! GONE!
PREMA!
PREMA!
PREMA!
PREMA!
[SPEAKING
FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
PREMA.
MY LITTLE BOY'S
GUN.
HE WANTED A GUN
TO KILL SURISTANI.
SURISTANI KILL HIM.
PREMA, MY BABY.
DO YOU HEAR ME, PREMA?
PREMA!
COLONEL CAMPBELL,
SIR,
UP OVER THE WALL.
SO THAT'S WHY
THEY ABANDONED CHUKOTI.
WE'VE GOT TO FOLLOW
SURAT KHAN.
HE CAN'T BE FAR OFF.
IMPOSSIBLE.
THEY'RE MOUNTAIN FIGHTERS.
WE DON'T STAND A GHOST
OF A CHANCE AGAINST THEM
IN THE HILLS.
BUT WE CAN'T STAND HERE
DOING NOTHING!
BY HEAVEN, WE'LL NEVER REST
TILL HE'S BEEN MADE
TO PAY FOR THIS.
INDIA WILL BE TOO SMALL
TO HOLD HIM.
[MAN]
THESE BOOKS WANT TO BE STORED
AND THE CASES
MADE READY FOR TRANSPORT.
[MAN]
AND ALL THE OFFICIAL PAPERS
IN THIS BOX HERE.
YOU'LL REPORT
TO THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF
ON ARRIVAL AT BALAKLAVA.
GOOD LUCK, WATSON.
THANK YOU,
SIR.
MAJOR VICKERS,
SIR.
OH, GEOFFREY,
MY BOY.
REPLACEMENTS
FOR THE 27th HAVE
REPORTED FOR DUTY, SIR.
GOOD, THEN YOU'RE READY
TO EMBARK.
NEVER BEEN TO THE CRIMEA,
HAVE YOU, GEOFFREY?
THEY TELL ME IT'S
A PESTILENTIAL HOLE.
SEEMS VERY STRANGE
TO ME, SIR,
THAT THE WAR OFFICE
SHOULD BE SENDING
THE 27th TO SEBASTOPOL
TO FIGHT THE RUSSIANS.
POOR DEVILS,
HAVEN'T THEY BEEN
THROUGH ENOUGH ALREADY
AT CHUKOTI?
THE RUSSIANS?
PEOPLES DON'T WAGE WAR
AGAINST OTHER PEOPLES,
GEOFFREY.
ENGLAND IS FIGHTING
THE TYRANNY OF THE CZAR.
THE 27th LANCERS
ARE FIGHTING SURAT KHAN.
SURAT KHAN.
IT MAY INTEREST YOU
TO KNOW THAT AFTER
THE CHUKOTI MASSACRE,
SURAT KHAN FLED.
YES, I KNEW THAT, SIR.
INDIA WAS TOO HOT
TO HOLD HIM.
THE WAR DEPARTMENT
HAPPENS TO KNOW
THAT HE TOOK REFUGE
WITH THE RUSSIANS
AND IS WITH THEIR FORCES
AT SEBASTOPOL.
THIS IS WORTH KNOWING.
NOW YOU UNDERSTAND
WHY THE 27th LANCERS
HAVE BEEN ORDERED
TO SEBASTOPOL.
EVERY MAN WILL HAVE
A CHANCE FOR VINDICATION,
NOT ONLY FOR HIMSELF
AND FOR HIS REGIMENT,
BUT FOR EVERY SEPOY
IN INDIA.
NOW, YOU BETTER
GET ALONG, GEOFFREY.
YOU HAVEN'T TOO MUCH TIME
TO GET YOUR KIT READY.
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
YES. COME IN.
WHY, ELSA.
GEOFFREY,
I HAD TO COME.
WHY, WHAT'S
THE MATTER?
PERRY IS GONE.
GONE? WHAT
DO YOU MEAN?
TO THE CRIMEA.
HE WAS ORDERED
BACK TO HIS REGIMENT,
AND HE SAILED TWO DAYS AGO
WITH SIR BENJAMIN
ON THE FIRST TRANSPORT.
OH, GEOFFREY,
HE'LL BE KILLED.
I KNOW HE WILL.
YOU LOVE HIM,
DON'T YOU?
I DO.
I CAN'T HELP IT.
A LONG TIME?
I THINK,
SINCE THE FIRST DAY
I MET HIM.
I TRIED TO TELL YOU
THAT DAY WHEN I CAME
BACK FROM LOHARA.
YOU NEEDN'T EXPLAIN.
I THINK I'VE KNOW IT,
REALLY, IN MY HEART...
FOR SOME TIME.
I'M SORRY, GEOFFREY.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
WHY, IT CAN'T BE HELPED.
QUITE A NATURAL THING.
HE'S A GRAND LAD, ELSA.
HE'LL MAKE YOU VERY HAPPY.
YOU'LL BE GOING
BACK TO ENGLAND,
I SUPPOSE.
YES. I THINK SO.
OH, YOU'RE LUCKY.
WISH I COULD GO, TOO.
WELL, I MUST FINISH
THIS STUFF UP.
GEOFFREY, ARE YOU GOING
OUT TO THE CRIMEA, TOO?
YES. LEAVING
ALMOST IMMEDIATELY.
MAY I HELP YOU PACK?
OH, NO, THANKS.
I'VE BEEN GIVING MYSELF
A CRICK IN THE BACK
ALL THE MORNING AS IT IS.
ELSA, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT PERRY.
HE'LL BE ALL RIGHT.
I'LL SEE THAT HE IS.
GOOD-BYE...
AND BLESS YOU...
BOTH OF YOU.
GEOFFREY, WILL YOU
TAKE HIM A MESSAGE?
WHY, YES.
TELL HIM...
THAT I THINK HIS BROTHER...
IS THE FINEST MAN
I'VE EVER KNOWN.
SIR CHARLES
MACEFIELD'S
COMPLIMENTS
TO GENERAL SCOTT.
THERE ARE
NO NEW ORDERS.
SOON AS THE WAR
COUNCIL'S OVER,
I'LL NOTIFY HIM.
WE MUST ATTACK
SEBASTOPOL.
GENERAL CANROBERT'S ANXIETY
IS PERHAPS PROMPTED BY THE FACT
THAT OUR SUPPLIES
ARE RUNNING LOW.
LORD RAGLAN
UNDERSTANDS
PERFECTLY.
CAN'T YOU SEE,
LORD CARDIGAN,
THE BALTIC FLEET
IS USELESS?
THE TURKISH FLEET,
I REGRET TO SAY,
HAS BEEN DESTROYED
BY THE RUSSIANS
AT SINOPE.
THE RECENT STORM HAS WRECKED
NOT ONLY THE RUSSIAN FLEET,
BUT THE LARGEST
OF THE FRENCH MAN-OF-WAR.
YOU UNDERESTIMATE
OUR RESOURCES, GENERAL.
SEE FOR YOURSELF.
WE HAVE SEBASTOPOL
UNDER SIEGE,
AND OUR FORCES HAVE
THE RUSSIANS AT BAY,
SO TO SPEAK.
BESIDES, SO FAR,
NO REAL OPPORTUNITY
TO ATTACK SEBASTOPOL
HAS PRESENTED ITSELF.
ALL RIGHT, CAPTAIN.
I'LL MAKE A NOTE OF IT.
LORD RAGLAN
CAN'T BE DISTURBED
WHILE THE WAR COUNCIL'S
IN SESSION.
TAKE IT UP WITH
SIR CHARLES MACEFIELD.
YES, SIR.
WAIT.
ALL RIGHT. CARRY ON.
YES, SIR.
MY PLAN TO WITHDRAW
THE LIGHT BRIGADE
IS PERFECTLY CLEAR
TO ALL OF YOU GENTLEMEN.
BE GOOD ENOUGH TO ISSUE
THE ORDERS, SIR CHARLES.
VERY GOOD.
I THINK THAT'S ALL
WE HAVE TO DISCUSS.
SOME PAPERS
FOR YOUR SIGNATURE, SIR.
HMM?
WELL, THESE
ARE NOT IMPORTANT.
PRESENTLY WILL DO.
SIT DOWN.
I WANT YOU
TO TAKE A DISPATCH.
GENERAL HEADQUARTERS,
ARMY OF THE CRIMEA.
FROM HIS EXCELLENCY,
FIELD MARSHAL
THE EARL OF RAGLAN, K.C.B.,
COMMANDING...
THE MAJOR GENERAL
SIR BENJAMIN WARRENTON, K.C.B.,
NO. 1174.
ON RECEIPT OF THIS ORDER,
YOU WILL WITHDRAW
THE LIGHT BRIGADE
TO A POINT
3 KILOMETERS SOUTHWEST
OF ITS PRESENT POSITION...
BY ORDER.
LIGHT BRIGADE'S
MOVING BACK, SIR?
YES.
WHAT'S SURPRISING
ABOUT THAT?
VOLONOFF COMMANDS
THE RUSSIAN
ARTILLERY POSITION
ON THE HEIGHTS
ABOVE THE VALLEY
OF BALAKLAVA.
SURAT KHAN'S
WITH HIM.
WE KNOW THAT.
DON'T YOU THINK
THE MEN OF THE 27th,
THE MEN FROM CHUKOTI,
OUGHT TO BE GIVEN
A CHANCE TO ATTACK THEM?
I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL.
EVERY BRITISH SOLDIER
WOULD GIVE HIS LIFE
TO AVENGE
THE CHUKOTI MASSACRE,
BUT AT THIS MOMENT,
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
MAY NEVER BE
ANOTHER CHANCE, SIR.
YOU MUST KNOW
THAT THE RUSSIANS
HAVE THEIR STRONGEST BATTERIES
SITUATED ABOVE THE VALLEY.
IT WOULD TAKE
AT LEAST FIVE REGIMENTS
FOR THE ASSAULT.
OH, NO, VICKERS,
IT'S SUICIDE.
THAT VALLEY,
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES,
IS A VALLEY OF DEATH.
IT WOULD BE
WORTH IT, SIR.
600 MEN ATTACKING
THE RUSSIAN CENTER
WOULD KEEP
THE ENEMY OCCUPIED
WHILE THE COMBINED
FRENCH, TURKISH,
BRITISH FORCES
ATTACK SEBASTOPOL.
SEBASTOPOL TAKEN,
THE CZAR MUST SUE
FOR PEACE.
YES. THE ENTIRE
CRIMEA SITUATION
HINGES ON SEBASTOPOL,
BUT THIS IS NO TIME
TO CONSIDER PERSONAL
FEELINGS, VICKERS.
YOUR PLAN IS
ADMIRABLY DARING,
BUT THAT'S JUST IT.
IT'S TOO WILD.
NOW, I WANT YOU
TO DELIVER THIS ORDER
PERSONALLY
TO THE COMMANDER
OF THE LIGHT BRIGADE.
IS THAT CLEAR?
YES, SIR.
WHY, WHAT'S UP, VICKERS?
WHAT? NOTHING.
YOU DO LOOK RATHER ODD,
YOU KNOW.
CONFOUND YOU, BENTHAM.
MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS,
WILL YOU?
I'M SORRY. YES, SIR.
NOW, GENTLEMEN,
THESE BATTLES
ARE THE FINEST
OF TWO AND A HALF MONTHS.
WE'VE LOST HUNDREDS OF MEN,
APART FROM THOSE WHO DIED
FROM THE COLD AND SICKNESS.
IT IS, THEREFORE, IMPERATIVE
THAT UNLESS--
ORDERS FROM GENERAL
HEADQUARTERS, SIR.
YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
GENTLEMEN.
HIS EXCELLENCY'S
COMPLIMENTS.
THANK YOU.
WELL, HOW ARE THINGS
OVER AT HEADQUARTERS?
THEY'VE BEEN
PRETTY DULL HERE.
I BEG YOUR PARDON, SIR.
THAT'S FROM
THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF.
IT'S IMPORTANT.
WELL, SIR.
"UPON RECEIPT OF THIS ORDER,
THE LIGHT BRIGADE WILL ADVANCE
AND TAKE THE ENEMY POSITION
ON BALAKLAVA HEIGHTS."
IT'S COME AT LAST.
YOU EXPECTED IT?
FOR WEEKS, VICKERS.
FOR WEEKS.
SO YOU THOUGHT
GENERAL HEADQUARTERS WERE
THE ONLY ONES IN THE KNOW,
BUT I, TOO, KNEW
THAT SURAT KHAN
WAS WITH VOLONOFF
ON THE BALAKLAVA HEIGHTS.
THE 27th--
THE MEN KNOW, SIR?
CERTAINLY NOT.
THERE'D BE NO HOLDING THEM.
DO YOU MIND
IF I TELL THEM?
YOU MEAN
YOU'RE COMING WITH US?
OF COURSE.
IT'S MY REGIMENT.
BESIDES, THIS
IS MORE THAN JUST
A FIGHT FOR ME, SIR.
AND TO ME, TOO,
MY BOY.
DO YOU THINK THAT I'VE BEEN
ABLE TO SLEEP SINCE
THAT AWFUL DAY AT CHUKOTI?
AND NOW, AT LAST...
WOULD YOU MIND IF I
SPOKE TO MY BROTHER
HERE IN YOUR OFFICE?
CERTAINLY NOT.
ORDERLY...
GO TO
CAPTAIN VICKER'S BILLET
AND REQUEST HIM
TO COME HERE AT ONCE.
[MAN]
YES, SIR.
GENTLEMEN, WE HAVE
ACTION AT LAST.
COME WITH ME.
I TRUST ALL THE UNITS ARE
READY TO MOVE OUT AT ONCE.
OH, I--I THOUGHT
SIR BENJAMIN SENT FOR ME.
NO. I SENT FOR YOU.
I WANT YOU
TO TAKE THIS DISPATCH
TO GENERAL HEADQUARTERS
AND WAIT THERE
UNTIL FURTHER ORDERS.
WAIT AT
GENERAL HEADQUARTERS?
BUT I'VE HEARD
THE REGIMENT'S
MOVING FORWARD.
IF I HAVE TO WAIT
AT GENERAL HEADQUARTERS,
I'LL BE OUT OF THE FIGHT
ALTOGETHER.
YOU'LL DELIVER IT
PERSONALLY TO
SIR CHARLES MACEFIELD.
YOU UNDERSTAND?
I BELIEVE YOU'RE TRYING
TO KEEP ME OUT OF THIS
DELIBERATELY
BECAUSE OF ELSA.
NO. NO. ELSA'S GOT
NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS.
YOU'RE NOT
IN THE DIPLOMATIC
SERVICE NOW, YOU KNOW.
YOU'RE
WITH YOUR REGIMENT
AT THE FRONT.
YOU'LL OBEY MY ORDERS
IMMEDIATELY.
IF I REFUSE?
YOU'LL BE
COURT-MARTIALED.
I SEE--
DISGRACED EITHER WAY.
VERY WELL.
BUGLER, SOUND ASSEMBLY.
MEN OF THE 27th,
SURAT KHAN IS ON THE FIELD
WITH THE OPPOSING
RUSSIAN FORCES,
THE SAME SURAT KHAN
WHO MASSACRED
THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN
OF CHUKOTI.
OUR CHANCE HAS COME.
SHOW NO MERCY.
LET NO POWER ON EARTH
STOP YOU.
PROVE TO THE WORLD
THAT NO MAN CAN KILL
WOMEN AND CHILDREN
AND LIVE TO BOAST OF IT.
MEN OF THE 27th,
OUR OBJECTIVE IS SURAT KHAN!
FORWARD!
13th DRAGOONS,
PARADE LEFT!
WALK MARCH!
11th HUSSARS, FORWARD!
WALK MARCH!
[BUGLING]
CAPTAIN VICKERS,
SIR.
SHOW HIM IN.
DISPATCH, SIR.
PERSONAL. URGENT.
THANK YOU.
"THEY'LL ATTACK
THE BALAKLAVA
HEIGHTS."
THIS IS INSANITY.
GENERAL WARRENTON
IS ATTACKING
THE RUSSIAN ARTILLERY.
THEY'LL BE SLAUGHTERED,
ALL OF THEM.
ORDERLY!
I MUST ISSUE ORDERS
AT ONCE
FOR THE CHATEAU
D'AFRIQUE AND
THE HEBREE BRIGADE
TO SUPPORT THEM.
LET ME TAKE IT, SIR.
TAKE YOUR
FASTEST HORSE.
THE LIVES OF 600 MEN
ARE IN YOUR HANDS.
YES, SIR.
27th LANCERS,
FORWARD!
13th DRAGOONS,
FORWARD!
8th HUSSARS,
FORWARD!
7th HUSSARS,
FORWARD!
4th DRAGOONS,
FORWARD!
WALK MARCH!
YOUR EXCELLENCY,
THE BRITISH LIGHT
CAVALRY
ARE
ADVANCING AGAINST
OUR POSITION.
WE'LL CUT THEM DOWN
BEFORE THEY CROSS
THE VALLEY.
NO DOUBT.
INSTRUCT BATTERY
COMMANDERS IN
POSITIONS 37 AND 22
TO OPEN FIRE
IMMEDIATELY THEY
COME WITHIN RANGE.
YOUR EXCELLENCY.
[BUGLE SOUNDS]
THEY'RE DEPLOYING
THE CHARGE.
SEE FOR YOURSELF,
YOUR HIGHNESS.
WHAT A TACTICAL BLUNDER.
FOOLS. WHY, THEY'LL RIDE
INTO CERTAIN DEATH!
CHARGE!
THEY'RE CHARGING!
WHAT MADNESS.
[SHOUTING COMMANDS]
ONWARD, MEN! ONWARD!
WHY, THEY'VE BROKEN
THROUGH THE FIRST LINE
OF BATTERIES.
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE!
STEADY, MEN!
HOLD YOUR LINE!
ONWARD, MEN! ONWARD!
INSTRUCT COLONEL PLATTOV,
14th CALVARY, TO PREPARE
THE COUNTERATTACK.
YOUR EXCELLENCY.
STEADY, MEN! PRESS ON!
INSTRUCT 14th CALVARY
TO ATTACK!
YOUR EXCELLENCY.
GENTLEMEN,
EVERYONE BELIEVES
THE 600 WENT
TO THEIR DEATH
AT AN ORDER FROM ME.
CONFOUND IT, MAN.
IT MUST HAVE BEEN
A MISTAKE.
I'LL STAKE MY LIFE.
YOU NEVER ISSUED THAT ORDER.
IT WAS
A MAGNIFICENT BLUNDER.
THAT ONE INSANE CLASH
TURNED THE TIDE IN OUR FAVOR.
BUT THERE WAS
A MISUNDERSTANDING,
WASN'T THERE?
THE ORDERS YOU GAVE--
WERE RECEIVED
AND CARRIED OUT.
BELIEVE ME, GENTLEMEN,
I FULLY APPRECIATE
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING
TO DO FOR ME,
AND I'M SORRY I HAVE
TO DISAPPOINT YOU.
YOU'RE SHIELDING SOMEONE.
YOU'RE A BLASTED FOOL,
GOD BLESS YOU.

May I go out now,
Miss Simpson?
Has it stopped snowing?
Not quite.
If it has stopped when your sister returns, perhaps she will take you out.
Oh, dear.
Here, kitty.
Suppose it never stops.
Suppose the man in charge of the snow has forgotten how to stop it.
Don't you think you had better work a while at your sampler?
No, thank you.
Oh, dear.
Hello, Sir Turtle.
You really must stop that,
Your Majesty. Stop it, I say!
Stop what?
The White Queen just knocked over the White King.
She never does look where she's going.
Alice, you know you are not supposed to play with your father's chessmen.
But I wasn't playing.
She deliberately bumped into His
Majesty and knocked him off his feet.
Alice, are you sure that that is true?
Well, I saw it.
Alice.
Yes, Miss Simpson.
At any rate, Your Majesty, stop bumping into your husband.
And you might tidy up a bit.
A white rabbit!
All dressed up in a muffler and overcoat and big woolly shoes.
There. It's gone into its nice warm rabbit hole.
It looked so funny all dressed up.
Alice, I am sure you know that there is no such thing as a rabbit dressed up in a muffler and an overcoat.
You must not say what is not true.
Well, it...
It wasn't untrue exactly.
I think you had better finish your tea.
There is another egg for you to eat.
I did eat both eggs, but I put one of them all back together again.
Alice!
Yes, Miss Simpson.
The looking-glass room.
You see, Dinah, as soon as I hold you up, the little girl in the looking-glass room holds up another cat just like you.
Oh, Dinah, wouldn't you like to see what the looking-glass house is like?
You know, Dinah, there is a looking-glass house.
First, there's the room you can see through the glass.
That's just the same as our sitting room, only the things go the other way.
You'd love living there.
But, of course, I don't know whether looking-glass milk is good to drink.
Well, anyway, then we would come to the hallway.
It is very like our own hallway as far as you can see, only it may be quite different beyond that.
Oh, Dinah,
wouldn't it be nice if we could get through to...
I can see all of the looking-glass room from here, all but a bit.
I would so like to see that little bit just behind the fireplace.
Do you think, Dinah, that if I pressed very, very hard and tried to look straight down, that I might...
Why, why...
Well, I knew this part of the room would be different.
But I do wish the looking-glass chair had moved when I moved ours.
There seems no other way.
If I could only fall like that all the time!
Can't be English.
Of course.
It's the looking-glass room.
Why, it's Uncle and Aunt!
I knew that if you could really get behind a picture,
you'd see the backs of people.
Poor Uncle Gilbert.
His trousers are all patched.
My dear niece, how would you like being framed in one pair of trousers for
20 years without being patched?
It must be very difficult.
It is.
But after all, it's only the front of a picture that counts, really.
Of course.
That is all.
What did you say?
But your hands say
20 minutes to 4:00.
I never let my left hand know what my right hand is doing.
This side of the looking glass has me all confused.
That's because everything is backward on your side.
Why, I...
I never...
Mama! Mama! Mama!
Mama! Mama!
What's that?
It's the voice of my child!
Your child!
Oh, my precious lily!
My imperial kitten!
I must be with my child.
Let me help you.
Mama! Mama!
Dear me.
There, there, my royal pawn.
Poor thing.
Watch out for the volcano.
It blew me up! Be sure you come up the regular way.
Don't get blown up.
You'll be hours and hours getting to the table at that rate.
I'd far better help you.
No, no!
The King's men! Somebody call out the King's men!
I assure you, my dear, I shall never, never forget the horror of this moment.
Well, you will forget, unless you make a memorandum of it.
I shall be very happy to remind you.
We will not be reminded by a volcano.
I'm not a volcano, and
I'm not a cyclone, either.
Then you're either a cyclano or a volcone.
And...
Well, what time was that?
I really haven't any idea, but it's very late.
I must hurry or I shall have to go back through the looking glass
before I've seen what the rest of the house is like.
My, what a strange way to walk about the garden.
The Duchess! The Duchess! Won't she be savage if I've kept her waiting!
Oh, dear! Oh, dear!
I shall be too late!
My ears and whiskers, how late it is getting!
Well, after such a fall as this,
I shall think nothing of tumbling downstairs.
I wish Dinah were here.
That's such pretty music.
Oh, dear.
Ouch.
Goodbye, dear feet.
Oh, will I ever get to the beautiful garden?
Oh!
Oh, Mouse!
Do you know the way out of this pool, oh, Mouse?
I'm very tired of swimming about here.
Perhaps you don't understand English.
I daresay you're a French mouse.
That's French for,
"Where is my cat?"
I beg your pardon. I quite forgot you didn't like cats.
Wait, oh, Mouse!
Oh, Mouse!
Not like cats?
Would you like cats if you were me?
Don't be angry. I wish I could show you our cat Dinah.
You'd take quite a fancy to her.
She's such a dear, quiet thing, and so good at catching mice.
Oh, I beg your pardon.
I hate you!
I hate cats!
My whole family hates cats.
Nasty, low, vulgar things!
Oh, dear!
Wait, oh, Mouse!
Cats! Cats!
Cats!
William the Conqueror, whose cause was favored by the pope, was soon submitted to by the
English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest.
Who are you, please?
I am a dodo.
How do you do?
My name is Alice.
And you are very wet.
I'm afraid I am, but there isn't much I can do about getting dry.
History is the driest thing I know.
Shall we dry you with history?
I'd be much obliged if you could.
Listen well.
Edwin and Morcar, the earls of
Mercia and Northumbria, found it advisable to go with Edgar Aetheling to meet William and offer him the crown.
William's conduct at first was moderate, but the insolence of his Normans...
How are you getting on, my dear?
Beautifully, thank you.
Shall I put you to sleep now?
No, thank you!
Then you'd best run along.
I'm about to recite some dates.
Yes, sir.
Thank you. Goodbye.
1585, Shakespeare was born,
1616, Shakespeare died...
Who are you?
I hardly know, sir, just at present.
At least, I know who I was when I got up this morning, but I must have changed several times since then.
What do you mean by that?
Explain yourself.
I can't explain myself, because I'm not myself, you see.
I don't see!
I can't put it more clearly,
for I can't understand it myself to begin with.
And being so many different sizes in one day is confusing.
It isn't.
Well, when some day you turn into a chrysalis, and after that into a butterfly,
you'll find it a bit queer, won't you?
Not a bit!
Well, maybe you wouldn't, but it would certainly feel very queer to me.
You? Who are you?
I think you ought to tell me who you are first.
Why?
Good day, sir.
Come back. I have something important to say.
Yes?
Keep your temper.
Is that all?
No.
So you think you've changed, do you?
I'm afraid I have, sir.
What size do you want to be?
I should like to be a little larger, sir, if you wouldn't mind.
Three inches is such a horrid height to be.
I am three inches high! It's a very good height to be!
I'm sure it must be, sir, but you see, I'm not used to it.
You'll get used to it in time.
One side will make you grow taller.
The other side will make you grow shorter.
One side of...
Of what?
The mushroom.
Which side will make me grow larger?
The large-making side, of course.
I'll take a little of both to make sure.
Oh, dear, now I'm too big again, oh, Caterpillar.
Mr. Caterpillar, sir, where are you?
Whoever lives here, it would never do to come upon them this size.
Why, I should frighten them out of their wits.
For the Duchess.
An invitation from the Queen to play croquet.
My compliments to the Queen.
My compliments to the Duchess.
There's no sort of use in your knocking.
Please, sir, how am I to get in?
I shall sit here till tomorrow.
I'm sorry you were hit, but how am I to get in?
I shall sit here for days and days.
But what am I to do?
Anything you like.
Please watch out for the baby!
She nearly killed the poor little thing.
If everybody minded their own business, the world would go round much faster than it does.
Speak roughly to your little boy And beat him when he sneezes
He only does it to annoy
Because he knows it teases
Wow! Wow! Wow!
Wow!
Wow!
Wow!
He only does it to annoy
Because he knows it teases
Here, you can nurse it a bit if you like.
Now, I must go and get ready to play croquet with the Queen.
Don't grunt. That's not at all a proper way of expressing yourself.
What am I going to do with this creature when I get it home?
If you're going to turn into a pig, my dear,
I'll have nothing more to do with you. Mind now!
There's no mistake about you now. You're a pig!
You would have grown up to be a dreadfully ugly child, but you do make a handsome pig, I think.
Why do you grin, oh, cat?
Because I'm a Cheshire Cat, that's why.
Well, then,
Cheshire puss, would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?
That depends a good deal on where you want to get to.
I don't care much where.
Then it doesn't matter which way you go.
So long as
I get somewhere.
You're sure to do that, if you only walk long enough.
Do you play croquet with the Queen today?
I should like it very much, but I haven't been invited yet.
You'll see me there.
Must you go so soon?
By the by, what became of the baby?
I'd nearly forgotten to ask.
It turned into a pig.
I thought it would.
Did you say pig or fig?
I said pig
and I wish you wouldn't keep appearing and vanishing so suddenly.
You make one quite giddy.
All right.
Don't you wish you could do this?
Well, I've often seen a cat without a grin, but a grin without a cat?
No room! No room!
No room! No room!
There's plenty of room!
Have some wine?
I don't see any wine.
There isn't any.
It wasn't very civil of you to offer it.
Your hair needs cutting.
You should not make personal remarks. It's very rude.
Why is a raven like a writing desk?
I believe I can answer that.
Do you mean you can find the answer to it?
Exactly so.
You should say what you mean.
What day of the month is it?
Fourth.
Ah! Two days wrong.
I told you that butter wouldn't suit the works.
Oh!
Some crumbs must have got in it as well.
Hmm. I put it in with a bread knife.
It was the best butter, you know.
What a funny watch! It tells the days of the month,
but doesn't tell what "o'clock" it is.
Have you guessed the riddle yet?
Why... Why, no. I give it up.
What is the answer?
I haven't the slightest idea!
Nor I!
I think you might do something better with time than wasting it asking a lot of riddles that have no answers.
Don't you speak about Time. I daresay you've never even spoken to him.
Perhaps not.
Time and I quarreled last March, just before he went mad, you know.
It was at a great concert given by the Queen of Hearts,
and I had to sing, "Twinkle, twinkle, little bat How I wonder what you're at"
You know the song, perhaps?
I've heard something like it.
It goes on, you know, like this.
Twinkle, twinkle, little bat
How I wonder what you're at
Up above the world you fly
Like a tea tray in the sky
Up above the world you fly
Like a tea tray in the sky
Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle...
Twinkle, twinkle, little bat
How I wonder what you're at
Up above the world you fly
Like a tea tray in the sky
Up above the world you fly
Like a tea tray in the sky
Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle
Twinkle, twinkle...
Well, I'd hardly finished the first verse when the Queen bawled,
"He's murdering the Time!
Off with his head!"
And ever since that, he won't do a thing I ask.
It's always 6:00 now.
Is that why all the tea things are out here?
Yes, that's it.
It's always teatime, and we have no time to wash the tea things in between.
Take some more tea.
I haven't had any yet, so I can't take more.
You mean you can't take less. It is very easy to take more than nothing.
I want a clean cup.
It's the stupidest tea party
I ever was at in all my life!
Very curious!
Would you please tell me why are you painting those roses?
I...
Well, as a matter of fact, Miss, this tree should have been a red rose tree and we put in a white one by mistake, and if the Queen should find out,
we'll all have our heads cut off.
So, you see, Miss, we're doing our best before she comes back to paint...
The Queen!
The Queen!
The Queen!
Come, come, get up!
Her Majesty, the Queen of Hearts.
Her Majesty, the Queen!
Off with his head!
Off with his head!
What is your name, child?
My name is Alice, so please Your Majesty.
Off with her head!
Off with her head!
Nonsense!
Off with her head!
Off with her head!
Consider, my dear.
She's only a child.
Off with her head!
Off with her head!
And besides, this is the executioners' day off.
It is, is it? Well, they shall lose their heads for this!
Can you play croquet?
Yes.
Then let the game begin at once.
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!
Must I behead you all?
Here, take it. Play.
Off with some heads.
You're pointing the wrong way for a mallet!
Pardon me. My back hurts.
Well!
Don't look at me.
I'm as mixed up as you are!
This game's slowing up.
Off with some heads!
Where are my victims?
Search the hedges.
Thrash the bushes.
Shake the trees!
How glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing.
How did you like your game?
Well, it was very exciting.
Of course it is.
And the moral of that is,
"Be what you would like to be."
Or, to put it more simply, "Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise
"than what it might appear to others that what you were or might have been
"wasn't otherwise than what you had been
"would have appeared to them to be otherwise."
I should understand that better if it were written down.
I can't quite follow it as you say it.
That's nothing to what
I could say, if I chose.
And the moral of that is...
It's a fine day,
Your Majesty.
I give you fair warning. Either you or your head must be off at once!
Please, Your Majesty, could you make it go away?
Queen! Queen!
Where are you, Queen?
What fun!
What is the fun?
The Queen.
They never really execute anybody she condemns, you know.
The King...
The King pardons everybody.
I'm very happy to know that, I'm sure.
Have you seen the Mock Turtle yet?
Why... Why, no. I don't even know what a Mock Turtle is.
It's what mock turtle soup's made from.
Come here, will you,
Mock Turtle, old thing?
What is his sorrow?
It's all his fancy.
He hasn't got no sorrow.
No sorrow, indeed.
Mine are the sorrows of a sorrowful sorrow.
Mine are the woes of a woeful woe.
Mine are the...
This here young lady, she wants for to know your history, she do.
I'll tell it her.
Sit down, both of you, and don't speak a word till I've finished.
Once I was a real turtle.
Oh, dear!
Oh, dear!
When we were little, we went to school in the sea.
The master was an old turtle.
We used to call him Tortoise.
Why did you call him
Tortoise if he wasn't one?
We called him Tortoise because he taught us.
You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question.
We went to school in the sea, though you mayn't believe it.
I never said I didn't. You did.
Hold your tongue!
We had the best of educations.
In fact, we went to school every day.
I've been to a day school, too.
We learned
French and music.
I only took the regular course.
What was that?
Reeling and writhing to begin with.
And then the different branches of arithmetic, ambition, distraction, uglification and derision.
And how many hours a day did you do lessons?
Ten hours the first day and nine the next and so on.
That's why they're called lessons, because they lessen from day to day.
Then the 11th day must have been a holiday.
Of course.
And how did you manage on the 12th day?
Well, that's enough about lessons.
Shall we play games, or shall the Mock Turtle sing?
Oh, a song, please, if the
Mock Turtle would be so kind.
No accounting for tastes.
Sing her Turtle Soup, will you, old fellow?
In a moment.
Beautiful soup
Who cares for fish
Game, or any other dish?
Who would not give all else for two
Pennyworth only of beautiful soup?
Pennyworth only of beautiful soup
Beautiful soup, beautiful soup
Soup of the evening
Beautiful soup, beautiful...
Faster! Faster!
Faster! Faster!
Faster! Much faster!
Are we nearly there?
Nearly there?
Why, we passed it
10 minutes ago. Faster!
It's all marked out like a chessboard.
Of course it's a chessboard,
and life is a chessboard, and you are a Queen's pawn.
You will go immediately to the fourth square, which you should reach in exactly no time.
Did you remark something?
I didn't know I had to make one just then.
You should have told me how kind it is of me to tell you all this.
No questions? Very well, then, no answers.
Open your mouth wide when you speak, and always speak in French
if you can't think of the English for something.
Turn out your toes as you walk
and always say "Your
Majesty," and so forth.
If you think we're waxworks, you ought to pay, you know.
Waxworks weren't made to be looked at for nothing, nohow.
Contrary-wise, if you think we're alive, you ought to speak.
I'm sure I'm very sorry.
I was wondering which is the best way out of this wood.
Would you tell me, please?
You've begun wrong.
The first thing in a visit is to say,
"How do you do?"
And shake hands.
I hope you're not much tired.
Why, nohow, but thank you very much for asking.
So much obliged.
You like poetry?
Yes, pretty well.
Some poetry.
But would you tell me first which road leads out of the woods?
What shall I repeat to her?
The Walrus and the
Carpenter is the longest.
"The sun was shining on the sea Shining with all his might
"He did his very best to make
The billows smooth and bright
"And this was odd because it was The middle of the night
"The Walrus and the Carpenter
Were walking close at hand
"They wept like anything to see Such quantities of sand
"'lf this were only cleared away'
They said, 'it would be grand'
"'lf seven maids with seven mops Swept it for half a year
"'Do you suppose,' the Walrus said
"'That they could get it clear?"'
"'I doubt it,' said the
Carpenter And shed a bitter tear"
"'Oh, oyster, come and walk with us, ' The Walrus did beseech
"'A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk Along the briny beach'
"They could not do with more than four To give a hand to each
"The eldest oyster looked at him But never a word he said
"The eldest oyster winked his eye And shook his heavy head
"Meaning to say he did not choose To leave the oyster bed
"But younger oysters hurried up All eager for the treat
"Their coats were brushed
Their faces washed
"Their shoes were clean and neat
"And this was odd because, you know They hadn't any feet
"'The time has come,' the Walrus said 'To talk of many things
"'Of shoes and ships and sealing wax Of cabbages and kings"
"'And why the sea is boiling hot And whether pigs have wings"'
"'A loaf of bread,' the Walrus said 'ls what we chiefly need
"'Pepper and vinegar besides
Are very good indeed
"'Now, if you're ready, oysters dear We can begin to feed'
"'But not on us, ' the oysters cried Turning a little blue
"'After such kindness that would be A dismal thing to do!'
"'The night is fine,' the Walrus said 'Do you admire the view?'
"'I weep for you,' the Walrus said 'I deeply sympathize'
"With sobs and tears he sorted out Those of the largest size
"Holding his pocket handkerchief
Before his streaming eyes
"'Oh, oyster,' said the Carpenter
'You've had a pleasant run
"'Shall we be trotting home again?' But answer came there none
"And this was scarcely odd because They'd eaten every one"
Well, they were both very unpleasant characters.
But at any rate, I'd better be leaving the wood
because it's really getting very dark. Well, goodbye.
Look!
Do you see that?
It's only a rattle.
Only an old rattle, quite old and broken.
I knew it was.
It's spoiled, of course.
My nice new rattle.
Of course, you agree to have a battle?
I suppose so.
Only she must help us to dress up, you know.
Of course!
"Tweedledee and Tweedledum
Agreed to have a battle
"For Tweedledee said Tweedledum
"Had spoiled his nice new rattle
"Just then down flew a monstrous crow As black as a tar barrel
"Which frightened both the heroes so
"They quite forgot their quarrel"
I hope you're good at pinning and tying string.
All this has got to go on somehow or other.
This is to keep my head from being cut off.
You know, one of the most serious things that can happen to one in a battle
is to get one's head cut off.
Do I look very pale?
Well, yes, a little.
I'm very brave generally, only today I happen to have a headache.
Well, I've got a toothache.
I'm far worse than you.
Then you'd both better not fight today.
We must have a bit of a fight.
Let's fight till 6:00 and then have dinner.
There's only one sword, but you can have the umbrella. It's sharper.
Only we must begin quick.
It's getting very, very dark.
And darker and darker.
What a thick black cloud that is, and how fast it comes!
Why, I do believe it's got wings.
It's the crow!
The crow!
May I put your shawl straight for you?
I don't know what's the matter with it.
It's out of temper, I think.
I've pinned it here and I've pinned it there, but there's no pleasing it.
It can't go on straight, you know, if you put all the pins on one side.
And dear me, what a state your hair is in!
Oh, the brush has got entangled in it.
And I lost the comb yesterday.
There, now you look better.
My finger's bleeding.
What's the matter?
Have you pricked your finger?
I haven't pricked it yet, but I soon shall.
When do you expect to do it?
When I fasten my shawl again, the broach will come undone.
Watch out, you're holding it all wrong.
Now you understand the way things happen here.
But why don't you scream now?
Why, I've done all the screaming already.
Now, what would be the good of doing it all over again?
I suppose so.
Well, it's a bit lighter now.
I'm glad that crow is gone.
I hope your finger's better now.
Much better. Better, better, better.
What is it you want to buy?
I should like to buy an egg, please.
I never put things into people's hands.
That would never do.
You must get it for yourself.
What a strange egg!
It keeps growing much faster than it should! Curiouser and curiouser!
It's bigger than a chicken!
Why, it's...
It's Humpty-Dumpty!
Don't stand there staring at me as if I were an egg.
Tell me your name and your business.
My name is Alice.
It's a stupid enough name.
What does it mean?
Must a name mean something?
Of course it must.
My name means the shape I am, and a right handsome shape it is.
With your name, you might be any shape.
Why do you sit out here all alone?
Because there's nobody with me.
Did you think
I couldn't answer that?
Ask another.
Don't you think you'd be safer on the ground?
That wall is so very narrow.
Of course I don't think so.
Why, if I ever did fall off,
which there's no chance of, but if I did...
If I did fall, the King has promised me...
To send all his horses and all his men.
Ah, so, you know. All his horses and all his men.
They'd pick me up again in a minute, they would.
However, this conversation is going on a little too fast.
Let's go back to the last remark but one.
I'm afraid I can't quite remember it.
In that case, we start afresh,
and it's my turn to choose a subject.
How old did you say you were?
Twelve years and four months.
Wrong. You never said a word like it.
I thought you meant,
"How old are you?"
If I'd meant that,
I'd have said that.
Twelve years and four months.
An uncomfortable sort of age.
Now, my advice would have been to leave off at 12, but it's too late now.
What a beautiful belt!
Or is it a beautiful collar?
It is a most provoking thing when a person doesn't know a collar from a belt.
I know it's very ignorant of me.
It's a collar, child, and a beautiful one, as you say.
It's a present from the White King and Queen.
Is it really?
They gave it to me for an un-birthday present.
I beg your pardon?
I am not offended, and it isn't respectable to beg.
I mean, what is an un-birthday present?
A present given when it isn't your birthday, of course.
I like birthday presents best.
You don't know what you're talking about.
How many days are there in a year?
Three hundred and sixty-five.
And how many birthdays have you?
One.
And if you take that from 365, what remains?
Three hundred and sixty-four, of course.
Well then, there are 364 days when you might get un-birthday presents.
Certainly.
And only one for birthday presents.
That's glory for you!
I don't know what you mean by glory.
Of course you don't, till I tell you.
I meant there's a nice knock-down argument for you.
But glory doesn't mean that.
When I use a word, it means what I choose it to mean, neither more or less.
The question is whether you can make words mean different things.
The question is, which is to be the master, you or the word? That's all.
However, I can manage the whole lot.
Impenetrability, that's what I say.
Would you tell me, please, what that means?
I meant by impenetrability that we've had enough of the subject, and it would be just as well if you would mention what you mean to do next,
as I suppose you don't mean to stop here all the rest of your life.
Fancy it meaning all that.
You seem very clever at explaining words, sir.
Would you kindly tell me the meaning of a poem called Jabberwocky?
I read it a long time ago.
I can, but I won't.
That's all. Goodbye.
Goodbye, till we meet again.
I shouldn't know you if we did meet.
You're so exactly like other people.
The face is what one generally goes by.
That's just it. Your face is the same as everybody's.
The two eyes, so.
Nose in the middle, mouth under.
Now, if your two eyes were on the same side of your nose, or your mouth on the top, that would be some help.
It wouldn't look nice.
Wait till you've tried.
Watch out!
Help! Help! I'm falling!
Tell the King!
Tell him to bring his horses and his men!
Help!
What happened?
We ran into each other,
Your Majesty.
Good. I rather fancied something like that had happened.
Oh, Your Majesty,
Humpty-Dumpty fell off the wall!
I know, I know.
Four-thousand, two-hundred and seven of my soldiers are on the way.
Two without horses.
If all this King's horses and men
can't put him back together again, nobody can.
I'm glad Humpty will be all right. I was worried.
Well, don't be.
Look along the road and tell me if you can see either of my three messengers.
I see nobody on the road.
Oh, I only wish
I had such eyes!
To be able to see nobody, and at that distance!
Oh!
It's too, too bad!
Can I help you, sir?
On or off?
You are on.
In a short time
I shall be off again.
I'm so sorry. Are you the King's messenger?
I am the White Knight.
I see you're admiring my little box.
It's my own invention, to keep clothes and sandwiches in.
You see, I carry it upside down so the rain can't come in.
But the things can get out.
Do you know the lid is open?
Then if all the things have fallen out, the box is no use without them.
Can you guess why I did that?
I can't imagine.
In hopes some bees may make a nest in it. Then I should get the honey.
But you've got a beehive, or something like one, fastened to the saddle.
It's a very good beehive, too.
One of the best kind, but not a single bee has come near it yet.
That other thing's a mousetrap.
I suppose the mice keep the bees out
or the bees keep the mice out. I don't know which.
It isn't very likely there would be any mice on a horse's back.
Not very likely, perhaps,
but I don't choose to have them running all about.
You see, I'm well provided for everything.
That's the reason the horse has those anklets around his feet.
What are they for?
To guard against the bites of sharks. It's my own invention.
But let's go on. I'll go with you to the edge of the wood.
I hope you've got your hair well-fastened on.
Only the usual way.
That's hardly enough. You see, the wind is so strong here.
It's strong as soup.
Have you invented a plan for keeping the hair from being blown off?
Not yet, but I have a plan for keeping the hair from falling off.
I should like to hear it very much.
First, you take an upright stick, then you make your hair creep up it like a vine.
Now, the reason hair falls off is because it hangs down.
Things never fall upward, you know. It's my own invention.
You may try it if you like.
I'm a great hand at inventing things.
Now, I daresay you noticed the last time you picked me up,
I was looking rather thoughtful.
You were a little grave.
Well, just then I was inventing a new way of getting over a gate.
Would you like to hear it?
Very much, indeed.
Well, I'll tell you how I came to think of it. I said to myself,
"The only difficulty is with the feet.
"The head's high enough already."
Now, first I put my head on top of the gate, then my head's high enough, then I stand on my head, then my feet are high enough.
Then I'm over.
Sir Knight!
If there were only a gate down here,
I'd be in excellent position to cross it.
How can you go on talking so quietly with your head in a ditch?
What does it matter where my body happens to be?
My mind goes on working all the same.
In fact, I once invented a new pudding during the meat course.
In time to have it cooked for the next course? Hmm.
That was quick work.
Well, not the next course.
In fact, I don't believe that pudding ever was cooked.
What did you mean it to be made of?
Well, it began with blotting paper.
That wouldn't be very nice, I'm afraid.
Not very nice alone, but imagine how good it would be mixed with other things, such as gunpowder and sealing wax.
And here I must leave you.
This is the end of the wood.
You've only a few yards to go.
Down the hill, across that little brook, and then you'll be a queen.
At last!
But you'll stay and see me off first?
I shan't be long.
You'll wait?
Of course I'll wait.
I think it'll encourage me.
Thank you very much for coming so far out of your way.
For that, I shall expect you to cry a good deal as I go.
The poor, dear Knight.
He's the nicest person yet.
Well, here I am.
What's this?
A crown! A golden crown!
I'm a queen!
I'm a queen!
How dare you say that you're a queen.
What right have you to call yourself so?
You can't be a queen, you know,
till you've passed the proper examination, and the sooner we begin it, the better. Be seated.
Yes, Your Majesty.
I'm ready, Your Majesties.
Can you do addition?
Now what's one and one and one and one and one and one, one and one?
I don't know.
I lost count.
She can't do addition.
Can you answer any useful questions? How is bread made?
I know that.
You take some flour...
Where do you pick the flower, in a garden or in the hedges?
It isn't picked at all, it's ground.
But how many acres of ground?
I wish you wouldn't leave out so many things!
Oh, dear.
You know any languages?
What's the French for "fiddle-de-dee"?
Fiddle-de-dee's not English.
Whoever said it was?
Well, if you'll tell me what language fiddle-de-dee is,
I'll tell you the French for it.
Queens never make bargains!
I'm so sleepy.
She's tired, poor thing.
So, smooth her hair, lend her your nightcap and sing her a soothing lullaby.
I haven't any nightcap, and I don't know any soothing lullabies.
I'll have to do it myself.
Hush-a-bye lady in Alice's lap
When the feast's ready we've time for a nap
When the feast's over we'll go to the ball
Red Queen and White Queen and Alice and all
Now that you know the words, sing it through to me. I'm sleepy, too.
Now what am I to do?
Do wake up.
To the looking-glass world
It was Alice that said
"I've a scepter in hand
"I've a crown on my head"
No admittance until week after next.
Why... Why, how dare you!
Fill up the glasses as quick as you can
And sprinkle the table
With buttons and bran
Put cats in the coffee and mice in the tea
And welcome Queen Alice with 30 times three
Put cats in the coffee and mice in the tea
And welcome Queen Alice
With 30 times three
Then put in the glasses, molasses and ink
And anything else that is pleasant to drink
Mix sand with the cider
And wool with the wine
And welcome Queen Alice
With 90 times nine
Mix sand with the cider
And wool with the wine
And welcome Queen Alice
With 90 times 90 times
90 times nine
You've missed the soup and fish! Serve the roast!
You seem a little shy. Let me introduce you to that leg of mutton.
Alice, Leg of Mutton.
Leg of Mutton, Alice.
How do you do?
May I give you a slice?
Certainly not!
It isn't etiquette to cut somebody you've been introduced to.
Remove the roast!
Will you, won't you, will you, won't you...
Please don't introduce the Pudding, or we shall get no dinner at all.
May I give you some?
Pudding, Alice.
Alice, Pudding.
What impertinence!
How would you like it if I were to cut a slice out of you, you creature?
Make a remark.
It's ridiculous to leave all the conversation to the Pudding.
Well...
You'd better prepare.
We're about to drink to your health. Queen Alice's health!
Queen Alice's health!
Queen Alice!
Queen Alice!
She ought to make a speech. A speech!
So she ought!
A speech! A speech!
A speech!
A speech!
Speech!
Speech!
I rise to return thanks.
Take care! Something's going to happen! Something's going to happen!
Here I am!
There was a looking-glass room, and you were the Red Queen.
There was a whole looking-glass country.
Right.
Look. Is any woman worth that?
Surely, you regret having betrayed your country.
- You can still have a chance...
- You're wasting time.
Come on, out with it.
Who is she? What is her name?
Tell us, you fool!
Mata Hari.
That's her name, isn't it?
- Let me alone.
- Oh, shoot him.
She bewitches them.
Why not? She bewitched all Paris.
She's France's greatest enemy.
The woman has become a mania with you, Dubois.
After all, you're the only one in Paris that believes she's a spy.
It's very dangerous to accuse a woman who's so powerfully protected...
...without proof.
- I'll get that proof.
And one cold morning, you'll see your fine
Mata Hari tied to one of those posts.
- Dine with me tonight?
- Thanks, no.
- Tonight I'm to see your Mata Hari dance.
- What?
A special soiree at LeMarchand's.
- How dare you.
- It's to be smart and very private.
After all, there is a war going on.
Oh, well, some dance and some die.
And some will do both.
- Is that it?
- I think it is, General Shubin.
- May I?
- Surely.
It is. Amazing.
Something of an event to see a ship arrive from Russia.
Event? Why, it's the first time in history, a flight over the German lines.
Congratulations. A great achievement.
Thank you, sir, but it's just sheer luck.
- And a good engine.
- The dispatches?
Quite safe, sir. I'm to deliver them to the ambassador personally.
Yes, of course. Of course. Major.
May I present Lieutenant Alexis Rosanoff of the Russian imperial air force.
Proud to meet such a brave young man.
Thank you, sir. But I was frightened to death all the way.
You'll hold yourself in readiness for a return flight to Russia...
...as soon as our reply is ready.
- Yes, Your Excellency.
- How long will it take to decode this?
- Ten to 12 hours, Your Excellency.
Rush it, please.
General Shubin, please report back here tonight at 11:3o.
This will call for immediate counsel.
Congratulations, lieutenant.
We shan't forget.
General Shubin will give you your instructions.
- Sit down.
- Thank you.
Well, you feel like celebrating?
Sleep is the only thing I'm interested in.
Can I put you up for the night?
No, thank you.
I still have my little place at Passy.
That is, if I can stay awake long enough to get there.
I'd ask you to dine with me, but I have to go to a reception right afterwards.
Mata Hari's dancing.
Mata Hari?
I'd be delighted to have dinner with you, sir.
- I'm not as tired as I was.
- No?
The prospect of a good dinner, perhaps.
Yes, I suppose that's it.
After all, it's rather absurd to go straight to bed your first night back in Paris.
I think I do feel rather like celebrating.
If you can stay awake.
- Funny, I'm not even sleepy anymore.
- No?
That's all right, Rosanoff.
There'll be such a crowd there, one more won't matter.
What do you mean?
Why, didn't you say you wanted to see Mata Hari dance?
Shiva...
...I dance for you tonight as the bayaderes danced in the sacred temples of Java.
Bravo!
Bravo!
They say her mother was a sacred dancer, her father a temple priest.
You know she married a Dutchman.
My dear, he used to beat her.
Really? I can't believe it.
She makes matrimony seem so dull.
I'd like to know her.
I feel that I do know her.
Madame Mata Hari, may a perfect stranger offer her appreciation?
- Thank you.
- Your costume was exquisite.
And those earrings, are they Javanese?
No, they are from India.
They're so intriguing. May I?
Andriani wants to see you at the Pavilion at once. It's very important.
- Glad you like them.
- Thank you.
Do you think...? Could you introduce me?
My dear boy, one doesn't meet Mata Hari on the spur of the moment like that.
Besides, I'm late now.
- Do you mind if I stay for a while?
- No, no. Not at all.
- Thank you. Good night.
- Good night.
- I thought you were different from the rest.
- Champagne, please.
Take this for me. I know what you like.
I know all about men like you...
Permit me, mademoiselle.
- Oh, wasn't she marvelous?
- Wasn't that a wonderful dance, monsieur?
It wasn't a dance, it was a poem.
- Do you know her?
- Who doesn't?
I would give my right arm to meet her.
So would I.
- To Mata Hari the incomparable.
- Unsurpassed.
- Priestess of the dance.
- High priestess.
- Goddess. Goddess of beauty.
- Bravo.
The dancer is only as beautiful as the mood of her dance.
- To Mata Hari.
- To Mata Hari.
Now, gentleman, I'm terribly tired.
You'll have to excuse me.
You've been very, very charming.
I thank you.
Good night, my lady.
Good night. Good night.
- Marvelous.
- Why, of course.
Have you ever seen people's faces when you dance?
Have you any idea of the effect you have on them?
My mind is so far away when I dance.
I live in another age.
Centuries back...
...when man and woman...
Brandy is bad for your heart.
I thought you'd given it up.
I give up a lot of things, but I take them back.
To me, anything I like is irresistible.
I've always been that way.
Unfortunately, it's in my blood.
What people you Russians are.
What charming savages.
Come in.
- The Marquis de Signac.
- Wait. We're going to the Pavilion.
- Pavilion?
- Yes.
I like gambling.
They laugh, it's gay there.
Gay? With Signac?
- Is that necessary?
- Why not?
He's very attractive, young.
Of course, he's not a general of the Russian imperial army...
...so important as you.
- A diplomat...
- or a traitor.
I said it, traitor.
- Now, quiet, Serge.
- The time has come when I can't be quiet.
There's something growing here that's going to make me shout out...
...the whole truth one day.
You want to die so badly?
I'm dead now.
Just as surely as though there were a bullet in my heart.
You killed me.
No. The brandy.
No, no, no. You.
Then why don't you give me up?
- I will.
- Well, do.
Come in.
- So you're going to the Pavilion?
- Yes.
- Much gambling.
- Caron, are you coming with us?
Sorry, my dear, but I have to be in court at 9.
- Most important case.
- Too bad, too bad.
- Shubin?
- Madame, I must be leaving.
I'm due at the embassy now.
Good night.
Good night, general.
- Tonight, late supper?
- No.
Tonight.
I thought it was all over.
Well, tomorrow, then.
I must help you to give me up.
Please, tomorrow.
Good night, General Shubin.
Good night.
Madame Mata Hari's car!
To the Pavilion.
To the Pavilion.
Eight.
Ten.
Four thousand francs.
Here you are, sir.
I have charted all gun emplacements and air batteries.
- Good. You were attached to me as a cook?
- Yes, sir.
- Technical expert, eh?
- Yes, sir.
- With the rank of captain.
- That's right, sir.
- You're a good soldier?
- I hope so.
- And a good German?
- Yes, sir.
Some months ago, I furnished you with plans and specifications...
...of a new weapon called the tank.
- Oh, yes, yes.
- You laughed at it, said it was impractical.
That's my belief, sir.
Well, captain, those impractical tanks went into action in the Somme yesterday...
...costing your country 2o kilometers of front and 18,ooo casualties.
- Impossible.
- So you said before.
Here are a few more of your mistaken conclusions.
Correct them.
- Send Mademoiselle carlotta here.
- Yes, sir.
Well, I was able to deliver your message, Andriani.
Mata Hari is here.
Thank you, carlotta.
That's what I wanted to know.
- Any more orders?
- No. No, just run along and enjoy yourself.
All right. Good night.
Dear lady.
Oh, good evening.
Won't you have my seat?
It's lucky.
It will be so much nicer to watch you.
- Thank you.
- A thousand francs for the bank.
- Two thousand.
- Ten thousand.
- Ten thousand.
- Ten thousand.
Madame.
Are you playing?
Never against you.
Any more bets?
Leon. Monsieur Leon.
- Oui, madame.
- I want some chips for this.
I'm sorry, madame.
We do not accept jewelry.
Perhaps one of the players.
You take it, madame.
He paid 1 o, ooo francs for it.
Who paid 1 o, ooo francs?
Whoever he was, he paid 1 o, ooo for it.
I'll sell it for 5.
He had very good taste.
- It's an unusual ring.
- May I buy it for you?
It's bought.
- Going?
- Wait. I may be back.
Thank you.
Still 4ooo in the bank.
Well, you're looking magnificent tonight, my dear.
Last time I seemed only beautiful to you.
You must have something very difficult for me tonight.
No, it shouldn't be for you. Important dispatches have arrived from Russia.
All right. I'm having supper with Shubin tomorrow night.
Splendid. Splendid. Why not tonight?
He's at the embassy.
- A conference.
- Probably concerns these dispatches.
- Probably.
- Then tomorrow night won't do.
You must see Shubin the minute he returns.
- I have arranged differently.
- Then change your arrangements.
I think you should handle Shubin yourself.
You get along beautifully.
- You're so alike.
- This is no time for any of your moods.
Something vital may be involved in this.
Something vital is involved in it.
- Good night, Andriani.
- Then I insist you see Shubin tonight.
A car will be waiting for you when you leave here.
You also insisted on that submarine job.
You finally had to do it yourself, as far as I remember.
How well you did it.
I intend to do a better job in finding out who informed the French authorities about it.
Of course, there's carlotta, she knew.
- And you knew.
- And so did you.
You don't trust me, do you?
Yes. Yes.
But you're capricious.
You're a little bit mad.
You might give me away just for the excitement of the thing.
You might get me killed.
Unless I kill you first.
Hadn't you better wait until after tomorrow night?
A car will be waiting for you tonight.
Madame.
I beg your pardon.
I saw you admire this ring...
...and I thought perhaps you would like to have it.
Why?
Well, as a token of my admiration for you.
How charming.
Beautiful.
Madame, the car you ordered is waiting.
I won't need it. This young man has offered to take me home.
Good night, Andriani.
- No, no, no.
- Just for a little while.
- No, no further.
- Please, don't say that.
I think you're very absurd, very persistent and...
- Very nice? Thank you.
- And very Russian.
Now, go home.
I'm afraid of losing what I've found.
Meaning?
You.
Hadn't you better take that off?
As long as you insist upon staying.
For a little while.
How long have you been in Paris?
I flew from London this morning.
I saw you once in the Bois.
You were so lovely.
I watched you till you drove out of sight among the chestnut blossoms.
Oh, Paris in the spring.
Spring.
And now I'm here.
- With you.
- But it's autumn.
But perhaps next spring, the war will be over...
...you and l...
- I never look ahead.
By next spring,
I shall probably be quite alone.
Never alone again.
I mean, at least my thoughts will always be with you.
No, you mustn't.
But you are so beautiful.
This is absurd.
I am going to bed.
Don't speak.
Good night.
- Madame, the hairdresser can take you.
- I'm too nervous.
- And the marquis is calling for you.
- I'm too tired, Marie.
- And Baron Michel telephoned.
- Oh, I'm not interested, really.
Mata.
Mata.
- But, no, sir.
- It's perfectly all right.
For the loveliest lady in all France.
I had to see you.
It seemed like wasting life to sleep.
You're even more beautiful than I remembered you.
- Why did you come here?
- I couldn't help it.
Out there, the birds were singing, and there was a softness in the air just like spring.
And you were the song of the birds and the warm brightness of the morning.
- It's very nice but...
- My heart was so full of you...
...I had to come back and tell you I love you and take you to lunch.
It's almost 2:oo and I have an appointment.
But you can break it.
I must take you to lunch.
- I told you I have an appointment.
- And I told you to break it.
You're a fool.
The most conceited fool I've ever known.
Mata.
What makes you think you have the right to burst in here?
I'm sorry. But last night you told me that you loved me.
Oh, did I?
Well, that was last night.
Today I am very busy.
Marie.
- Yes, madame.
- The gentleman is leaving.
You are quite right. I have been a fool.
I won't make this mistake again.
Still a peasant, lvan, huh?
Still superstitious.
Evil spirits come in on the wind.
There's Madame Mata Hari.
Leave that alone.
Hurry up, open the door.
Go on.
Monsieur Dubois.
Dubois?
What on earth can he want?
Tell him...
Tell him I can't see him.
Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute.
Tell him...
...that I shall be delighted.
My dear Dubois.
I'm afraid I'm intruding.
And inwardly you must be saying,
"confound this man Dubois."
- No. No, not at all, but...
- I'll be brief.
And if I seem to touch on matters that are...
...how shall I say it, too intimate, you must forgive me...
...it is because of my duty.
- Yes?
You are very friendly with a lady...
...perhaps the same one that you are expecting tonight.
Well, what if I am?
We consider this woman a very grave danger.
And as you know her better than anyone else, we want you to help us.
Why, what are you talking about?
- I'm expecting Mata Hari.
- Exactly.
And Mata Hari is a spy.
- In the pay of the Wilhelmstrasse.
- A spy.
Oh, my dear Dubois.
- Now you insult my intelligence.
- Please.
Either that or you've lost your mind.
I'm quite sane, I assure you.
Well, if she's a spy, why don't you arrest her?
Because I need definite proof.
And that's why I am here.
This is an absolute joke.
It's really too good, you know.
Mata Hari, a spy.
You know, for a moment,
I almost took you seriously.
Well, if the joke is as good as that,
I'd like to hear it.
Or maybe it's too bad for me to hear.
No, no, no. Our poor friend Dubois here...
...says that you are a spy.
Well, of course I am.
Everyone is Paris knows that.
Even Dubois, who knows everything.
- Couldn't you guess, Shubin?
- No, I think I'm getting old and stupid.
As I've amused you both so much...
...perhaps I need not apologize.
- Please don't misunderstand...
I don't. Evidently, I'm mistaken.
Good night, madame.
I'm very sorry you found it necessary to put me in this position.
I spoke in confidence.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Please don't misunderstand, the whole thing was a joke.
Mother in heaven, I'm done for.
I'm finished.
What did he say?
He said that you were a spy and that I was your...
- What else?
- Nothing else.
I'm sure he suspects.
Well, he wouldn't come here if he suspected you.
It's me he's after. You're quite safe.
But he must know something. Why should he come here at 11:oo at night?
The chief of the spy bureau.
It's a trap, of course.
Don't be ridiculous.
Ridiculous?
Ridiculous.
Oh, what a fool I've been.
Nothing mattered.
Honor, self-respect, everything gone.
Because of you.
You can't give away like this.
- Dubois knows nothing.
- He knows nothing.
Here I am facing dishonor, perhaps death...
...and it means nothing to you.
You haven't even a word of pity for me.
You're all unstrung, Serge.
Nothing's happened.
Look at it calmly.
Laugh at it.
We'll laugh at it together.
When you hold me like this, nothing seems to matter.
Nothing in the world.
This must never leave your hands...
...till you have delivered it personally to the prime minister. That is vital.
Should you be forced down in enemy territory...
...pull this cord, and the contents will be completely destroyed.
I understand.
The officials at Le Bourget Field will telephone you at your rooms...
...as soon as flying is possible.
It is imperative...
...that these dispatches be in Petrograd as soon as human means can contrive.
Yes, Your Excellency.
Mr. Palin will have these sealed and delivered to you.
And now, goodbye and good luck.
- Thank you, Your Excellency.
- Lieutenant.
On your way, inquire if General Shubin has any further instructions.
Don't be so secretive.
I know that the embassy has received important news from Russia.
Please, don't ask me things.
Not tonight.
But all you've got to say is yes or no.
Well, at least you can tell me how they came, by courier?
- No.
- By wireless, then.
No.
By airplane.
The airplane from Russia?
No.
Please, don't ask me anything more.
I can't stand it.
I can't get that Dubois out of my head.
Well, maybe you'd rather be alone.
You might as well be.
Your thoughts are not with me.
My thoughts are with you always.
Are they?
Is that why you haven't kissed me for hours?
Oh, Mata.
What is it?
Lieutenant Rosanoff.
Come in. Come in.
May I present Lieutenant Rosanoff.
Madame Mata Hari.
I believe we've met before.
I don't think so, madame.
Well, what is it?
I'm flying back tonight, sir.
I am to inquire if you have any further orders.
I don't believe so.
Surely you are not thinking of flying in this weather?
Rosanoff!
- Yes, sir.
- Madame spoke to you.
I know it, sir.
Oh, never mind.
You can't expect monsieur to answer chatter with a flight for Russia on his mind.
Safe voyage, monsieur.
Come back to us soon.
Paris in the spring...
...with all those chestnut blossoms.
Good night, monsieur.
Lieutenant.
Yes, sir.
- What's the matter with you?
- Nothing, sir.
Madame spoke to you.
There was nothing to answer.
You're insolent.
- I advise you to return to your quarters.
- Yes, sir.
Impudent fool.
I really can't apologize enough for him.
He must have been drinking.
I thought he was quite nice.
And brave.
Flying all the way to Russia.
Well, this time you didn't have to tell me anything, did you?
Your conscience is quite clear.
I can't believe they'd send a dispatch that you know nothing about.
I've told you, I have nothing to do with political matters.
Mata, if you don't help me forget...
...this ghastly business for a few hours,
I'm going insane.
Of course you should forget them.
We both will.
Well, doesn't matter.
- He wouldn't dare.
- Who wouldn't dare?
Dubois.
What about him?
I was only thinking if he were to search my rooms while I am here...
What are you driving at?
It doesn't matter.
But those official figures that you sent me...
You haven't destroyed them?
- Not yet.
- How could you be so careless?
I suppose it was a little careless, but they're safely hidden away.
But Dubois may be there now.
It may be too late.
You must go.
I wouldn't think of leaving you for something that can't possibly happen.
Please, I can't stand it.
Come.
I'd go myself, but I'm sure they're watching the house.
Please, now, don't lose a moment.
Telephone me the moment that you've destroyed them.
- Not safe.
- Well, then come back here.
Of course I will.
Don't worry.
- Hey, get out of the way!
- Get out of the way!
Back up! Back up! Back up, will you!
Good evening, Mother Durand.
Come quick.
Call Andriani.
Tell him to send B-14 to Lieutenant Alexis Rosanoff's at once.
Right here is the address.
He must wait outside...
Am I allowed to come in?
Why did you come here?
To see you.
You finished your rendezvous early.
No, I ran away from it.
Why?
Because of you.
I'm afraid that Shubin was furious.
- I can't make you out.
- I can't either.
Are you still angry?
Haven't I the right to be?
- This morning you acted like...
- I can explain.
And tonight I find you alone with Shubin.
Alexis, don't think wrong of me.
Artists need help and influence.
And Shubin can do so much to help my career.
- So I can imagine.
- But we are nothing to each other.
Please be glad to see me.
Are you sorry I came?
No.
Well, then, look at me.
Please.
Please forgive me.
Nice character in this room.
- This is the czar, isn't it?
- Yes.
- Who's the old gentleman there?
- My father.
I like his face.
- And this Madonna?
- The Madonna of Kazan'.
My mother made a pilgrimage to the Shrine of Miracles to get it for me.
It's about 1 oo miles from our town.
She walked all the way.
What is it supposed to do?
- Bring you luck?
- Oh, no. It guards you from evil.
I had to kneel before the altar...
...and promise Mother I would always keep a flame burning before it.
- And have you?
- Of course.
My orderly has taken care of it all the time I've been away.
You're a strange boy.
Who loves you.
Do you?
I love you as one adores sacred things.
What sacred things?
God...
...country...
...honor...
: : : you:
- I come last?
- No.
- That's how you said it.
- You come first.
Before anything.
Before...
...anything?
Yes.
There is so much light in here.
Put out that one too.
- The Madonna's lamp?
- Yes.
I couldn't do that.
You said I came first.
But don't you understand that it's a holy lamp?
That I swore to keep it burning?
You wouldn't do that for me?
Why? Why do you ask me to?
- To see if you love me as you say.
- I do, Mata. I do.
Well, then put it out.
If you love me.
I'll do anything, but please don't ask me to do that.
- I'm going.
- No.
Forgive me.
Steady.
Steady.
You are still here, sir.
- And they didn't telephone?
- Yes, someone did.
- Then the plans have been changed.
- I didn't answer. Get me a taxi.
- You didn't answer? Why not?
- I told you to get me a taxi.
If anyone calls, you tell them I'm out.
Quickly!
Yes, sir.
- Lieutenant Rosanoff?
- Gone out.
- This is his servant.
- Where'd Rosanoff go?
- He went to the embassy a long time ago.
- Impossible. We just came from there.
- Then he must have met with an accident.
- But when?
- Oh, these Paris taxis.
- Come on.
I hope it's not a bad accident.
I have to see her.
I'll wait here till I do see her.
Madame Mata Hari is not in.
- Where is she?
- I don't know, sir.
- Where would she be? Who are her friends?
- I don't know. Where would she be?
Where would she be?
- General Shubin's?
- I've told you, sir, I don't know.
All right.
While I know you'll hate to leave Paris,
I must ask you to go on a little mission.
- Yes? Where?
- To Marseilles.
- Marseilles?
- Yes.
Oh, no. Don't do that to me, Andriani.
Think of how I've served, the work I've done.
- Have pity on me.
- No, no. There's no need...
...of you becoming hysterical.
You're simply being ordered to Marseilles to meet our Spanish agent.
- What is so terrifying about that?
- It means my number's up. I know.
You think I'm a traitor. I'm not.
I'll swear by everything I hold sacred.
And what do you hold sacred?
There's a train tonight.
Brille has your tickets.
I won't go.
I won't go meekly to be slaughtered.
Remember, this is Paris, not the Wilhelmstrasse.
If you force me to be a traitor,
I'll go to the French police...
...and tell them everything I know.
They'll protect me.
You ought to know.
Jacques.
Now, now, now. What's the matter, dearie?
Not feeling well?
Hello, Mata.
Well, if everybody obeyed orders as loyally as you do...
Thank you.
- Any further orders for me?
- Yes.
Yes, here are the photographs of the dispatches.
Take that to Shubin and have him send them in the first diplomatic mail to Holland.
Very well.
- You don't seem to be in very good humor.
- No.
I'd think your success of last evening should put you in the very best of spirits.
- To the contrary.
- Why?
Surely, a simple job like that needn't have been unpleasant.
Most unpleasant.
He's in love with me.
Well, that's not unusual.
He wants me to marry him.
Not really? Marry...
Well...
Why is that so funny?
- What is it?
- We are dispensing with carlotta's services.
She seems to resent it.
Poor carlotta.
She shouldn't have fallen in love.
I've warned her and you about that before.
I am surprised she didn't respect your wishes in the matter.
She was afraid of you.
Ours is an exacting profession.
We're permitted no friends, no emotions, no personal life of our own.
What are you driving at?
I'm simply reminding you that a spy in love...
...is a tool that has outlived its usefulness.
You're so subtle.
You imagine that I am in love?
Well, I did think for a moment that you were taking this Rosanoff a little too seriously.
I never expect to see Rosanoff again.
I never want to.
But it's not because I'm worried by any threats of yours.
But I want you to see him again.
He may continue to be very, very useful to us.
- Not to me.
- But...
I don't ever want to touch that boy's life again.
Hello.
What?
Yes.
He did not report to the flying field?
Tell His Excellency I'll be there as quickly as possible.
- Ivan! My tunic.
- Yes, sir.
Hurry, hurry.
I knew this was going to be an unlucky day when I woke up.
Put it down. Put it down!
Get me a dozen orchids and take them to Madame Mata Hari.
Take this note along with it.
Meet me at the embassy.
Yes, sir.
Monsieur Dubois.
Good morning, my friend.
- Good morning.
- Oh, no. No one would ever forgive that.
To spoil a man's supper, then come back and spoil his breakfast.
- Sit down, please.
- Thank you.
- Well, what is it today? More melodrama?
- No, no.
- Today it is a farce.
- Oh, indeed. I see.
Last night I was bold enough to hint at a relationship...
...between you and a certain lady.
And I've come to apologize...
...because I was mistaken.
Oh, yes, because I discovered...
...that this lady's inclinations are entirely elsewhere.
- Oh, yes?
- Oh, yes.
We older men merely furnish the soft lights and champagne.
The mood, as it were.
Youth whistles, and we? We spend the rest of the evening reading a book.
Just what are you trying to get at?
Merely this, that Mata Hari went straight to the rooms of young Rosanoff...
...when she left here last night.
And the previous night, he was with her.
In what way does this concern me?
Well, it doesn't. It merely illustrates what a fool I made of myself.
Yes, yes.
Well, if you will pardon me, I have a most important engagement at the embassy.
I'm very sorry to detain you.
It's stupid of me.
But I had to drop in and apologize for my silly mistake.
- Very kind of you. Yes, charming.
- Good morning.
- Did it work?
- I don't know yet. He seemed calm enough.
But there may be quite an interesting reaction. We shall see.
Shubin?
Shubin?
What's happened?
A private air raid?
You cheat.
- You liar.
- "Good morning, liar" would be more polite.
- Be quiet, you...
- We'll omit the pet names.
- Come to the point.
- Rosanoff. That's the point.
You were with him all last night.
Dubois told me.
How does he know?
Did he look through the keyhole?
- Don't deny it.
- I don't.
Of course I was with him.
He had information I wanted, and I got it.
That's all.
You didn't think I went there because of...?
Can't you understand why Dubois is doing this?
- He knows what you mean to me.
- You're lying.
You love that boy, and I know it.
Would I have taken this if I loved him?
What is it?
Photographs of his dispatches to Russia.
Doesn't that convince you?
Yes, I'm quite convinced.
Convinced it's not the whole truth.
What about the night before last?
Did he have the dispatches then?
No, he did not have the dispatches then.
But he had you, huh?
That's what Dubois said.
We older men supply the champagne.
But when youth sings, the old fool stays home and pays the piper.
That's what Dubois said.
Hello.
- Wagram-6oo.
- What are you doing?
I think it's only fair to apologize to Dubois.
After all, he was right, you know.
Hello, Monsieur Dubois?
Who's calling?
Hold the wire.
General Shubin on number three.
Yes? Dubois speaking.
Will you please repeat that?
I didn't quite hear you.
You were right. She is a spy.
I'll give you all the proof you want.
Well, come over! She's here.
I'll keep her here.
Get me a car quick.
At last, I've got Mata Hari.
You've been cheating men all your life.
But there'll be 12 men you won't cheat, the firing squad.
No firing squad for me, Shubin.
It'll be your word against mine.
And after all, I have friends.
Paris will laugh at you.
A jealous, hysterical fool.
Perhaps not. You and Rosanoff may get out of this, but I don't think so.
Rosanoff?
- And what has he to do with it?
- Everything.
Rosanoff is a traitor. He permitted you to copy his dispatches.
- That's not true.
- Fortunately...
...this time it isn't a question of anyone's word. I have proof.
Proof that you gave me yourself.
You've stood that boy against a wall, just as surely as you're standing there.
I never knew that anyone could be so vile.
Vile? Not at all, madame,
I'm simply doing my duty.
How ironic, you love a man and send him to his death.
Hello.
- Official-27.
- Don't do it, Shubin.
I beg you not to do it.
Hello? His Excellency's secretary, please.
- Leave him out of this. He's innocent.
- Hello, this is General Shubin speaking...
...I must speak to His Excellency at once.
- I'm warning you.
- Don't, don't do it!
- Hello, Your Excellency?
I'm coming to the embassy at once.
I must speak to you on a most urgent matter.
Shubin, if you don't stop...
- Hello, Excellency?
- Shubin!
I'll explain when I arrive. In the meantime, order the immediate arrest of...
- What do you want here?
- You.
Why, you must be mad.
Why haven't you left yet?
- But l...
- I told you. I told you I'm not for you.
Before I go, I want to tell you this.
Whatever you've been, whatever you are, whatever you will be...
...we belong to each other.
- Alexis, it can't be.
I am what I am. You don't know me.
Go away and forget me.
Forget you? How can I?
- Could you? Could you forget us?
- Women like me are trained to forget.
We mustn't admit a heart.
- You are lying. You know you are lying.
- I am not.
- You are.
- No!
You're crying, Mata. You do love me.
Don't you?
Don't you?
- Alexis, you must leave.
- I won't. I won't until you come.
- It's your duty to go.
- No.
Alexis, please go now.
When it's all over, if you still want me,
I'll come to you no matter where you are.
I'll come to you, I swear it.
But go now.
General Shubin? General Shubin?
General Shubin, Dubois speaking.
Something strange about this.
You got something to open this door?
- I'll get something.
- Yeah.
- Will this do?
- Yes, fine.
- That's hardly a surprise.
- Suicide.
- Suicide.
- He's only been dead a few minutes.
Probably long enough for Madame Mata Hari to destroy all the proof he told us about.
- Who are you?
- Russian embassy.
Shubin was talking to His Excellency.
There was a woman's scream and a shot.
- See if she's overlooked anything.
- Is he dead?
- Yes. A woman's voice, huh?
- Screaming.
And the word of a dead man.
Come on.
All the papers are saying it's a suicide.
If everyone's convinced, what's the use of my hiding like this?
Dubois may be doing that merely to trap you.
- It's unfortunate you found it necessary to...
- I'm the best judge of that.
- Have you still got you Dutch passport?
- Yes.
It doesn't suit my plans to have you arrested.
You're sailing tonight for Amsterdam.
I'll go anyplace gladly after three days of this. It's too ridiculous.
And furthermore, your usefulness in Paris is permanently over.
Here is the list of the Allied agents in Belgium.
Commit those names to memory and then destroy it.
And report to H-12 immediately you arrive in Amsterdam.
- Come in.
- Well, what is it?
- Madame sent for me.
- Yes.
I want him to get a letter through.
- For Lieutenant Rosanoff.
- Rosanoff? But he is...
- What is it? What were you going to say?
- Well, l...
Get out. Get out!
Something's happened to him.
Tell me what it is.
He's dead.
Dead?
- How?
- Plane crash.
Just this side of the enemy line.
It's too late to do anything for him now.
No sense in your risking...
- Don't talk to me.
- Well, maybe I'm wrong, of course.
Maybe he's only injured.
Yes, that's it, I think.
Well, can't you remember?
You must remember.
Why is it so important to you?
Where are you going?
- I'm going to find out.
- Wait a minute. Don't lose your head.
After all, he's not dead, he's only injured.
- And where is he?
- I don't know, some hospital, I suppose.
- Well, I'll find out.
- And be arrested?
The police are probably looking for you now.
- Remember, you have your orders.
- What do I care for your orders?
You can't frighten me. I'm not carlotta.
I'm Mata Hari and my own master.
Here are your orders. I resign.
- Not so loud, someone will hear you.
- Oh, so you resign?
Very well, Mata Hari,
I accept your resignation.
- You'll let her resign?
- My dear Durand, you ought to know.
The only way to resign from our profession is to die.
- Wait here.
- Yes, ma'am.
Flowers, madame. Flowers. Nice flowers.
- How much?
- Two francs.
Thank you.
- Room 1, that corridor.
- Thank you.
Could you tell me...?
Could you tell me where Room 1 is?
I'm afraid you'll have to ask someone else.
Sister Teresa, some water, please.
Here. Here it is.
Mata.
It's all my fault, Alexis.
If I hadn't kept you...
If I'd let you go sooner, this wouldn't have happened.
It would have happened just the same.
Really, Mata, you mustn't blame yourself.
I'll spend my life trying to make it up to you.
Oh, but I'm going to be all...
- I'll be out of here any day now.
- On that day, we'll be married.
But, Mata...
You asked me, didn't you?
There is so much ahead of us.
Everything. But I must tell you something.
And as soon as the war is over, we'll go away...
...to all the places that were made for lovers.
- And, oh, the things we'll see together.
- Don't, please.
- What?
- I don't want to frighten you, but...
What is it?
It would be glorious to go with you...
...but I may never be able to see all those splendid things.
Is it your eyes?
Here are your eyes.
What's wrong with them?
With those "ridiculously long lashes," as you said.
Now, please, it isn't worth crying about.
I'm happier this moment than I've ever been in all my life.
What do the doctors say?
They aren't very optimistic.
But you know what doctors are.
- They don't know anything.
- No.
I'll get you great specialists.
They'll make you see.
We'll travel all over the world till we find the right man.
I'll never leave you again.
Gentlemen, I appeal to you.
That man, he's been molesting me.
What? I'll handle this.
I haven't done anything.
- Back to Paris. Quick.
- Yes, miss.
Madame, I have a warrant for your arrest.
Be careful you don't have to apologize again, Dubois.
Now, Monsieur Dubois...
...you say that General Shubin admitted over the telephone...
...that Mata Hari was an enemy spy?
- Yes.
- He had indisputable proof she was a spy?
- Yes.
General Shubin told you, also, that she was there with him...
...while he was talking with you?
- Yes.
And you went there immediately, and you found that Shubin had been murdered?
- Yes.
- That's all. Thank you.
Does the defense wish to question the witness?
No, I don't care to prolong this farce.
You've not brought to that stand one human being who has said that this is so.
- "I know it. I saw it. I swear it."
- The counsel for the defense...
...evidently has as poor a memory as his client.
Didn't General Shubin say that Mata Hari...
...was in his rooms at the time he was telephoning?
Oh, no.
Dubois said that Shubin said that she was there.
We cannot blame Monsieur Dubois, of course...
...for accepting too readily whatever information was given to him.
But has he any proof that it was Shubin who spoke over the telephone?
No. And now I want that.
I demand that the prosecution produce some one witness...
...who will swear to one definite thing...
...or I demand that Mata Hari be acquitted with the apologies of the court.
There is a man who saw Mata Hari at General Shubin's that morning.
This man was overheard by a nurse in the hospital...
...discussing this fact with the prisoner.
Overheard. Overheard.
Something more overheard.
Why don't you bring him here and let me question him under oath?
I had hoped to avoid bringing to court a brave young officer...
...recently blinded in the course of heroic duty.
But if the defense demands it, summon Lieutenant Alexis Rosanoff.
No, no, no. He knows nothing of this.
All he can say is what I said to him as I came out of that room.
When you came out of what room,
Mata Hari? What room?
I'll tell you. Shubin's room!
Your witnesses were perjured.
You have no alibi.
When Shubin called you a spy over the telephone, he told the truth.
And you knew it, and you shot him in an attempt to save yourself.
But it has not saved you, Mata Hari.
You stand proven an enemy of France.
Sister Teresa, will you read this to me once more?
For the last time.
- For the last time?
- Yes.
"Dearest, I shall not be able to see you or even to write to you...
...for some time to come.
A sudden attack, nothing really serious, has caused my removal to a sanitarium.
You must not be alarmed...
...because the only pain I feel is that of being without you."
"And when it becomes too sharp, I think of all the happiness we have had together...
...and that which we are going to have.
Then I can bear anything.
Good night, Alexis.
Tomorrow is sure to be glorious.
It brings me closer to you.
Mata."
In the name of the French Republic, this court finds the accused, Mata Hari...
...guilty of espionage and of communicating military information to the enemy.
Therefore, this said court, by virtue of articles 2o5, 6 and 7 of the military code...
...condemns this woman to be shot to death by rifle fire.
On display!
Left.
- Any news about the reprieve?
- We are expecting her lawyer any minute.
Oh, it's getting close to 5:oo.
Here.
Give her that. Cognac.
That'll put heart into you.
- You're a good man.
- Good?
Because I give a dying woman a drink?
You don't want jewelry and you can't use clothes.
- What can I give you?
- There's nothing.
We have everything we need.
Everything you need?
- How is that possible?
- We serve God and are content.
I wonder if I could be like that if I had to do it all over again from the beginning.
No.
That's how I am, and that's how I had to be.
No, little Sister, mustn't waste your tears on me.
Madame, Maître caron.
Oh, he's come to bring the reprieve.
My dear, dear child.
- No?
- I tried everything.
I appealed to the highest quarters.
I know you did.
Come and sit down.
I spent a whole hour with the president, who is one of my oldest friends, but...
What about Alexis?
That's all settled, just as you wanted it.
He's downstairs now.
- I'll...
- Wait.
Will you give him this...
...afterwards?
- And be very gentle with him.
- Of course, my child.
I hope I have written the things that'll help him most.
And if I haven't, perhaps you will know what to say.
I'll know what to say.
That in having your love even for a little while...
...he had more than most men ever have.
No.
Just tell him that no matter what he hears about me...
...and he will hear things...
...that my love for him was honest.
That's all.
Except that he must be happy.
Must laugh and love.
And then, someday, when he's an old man...
...and his grandchildren ask him about Mata Hari...
...he must tell a great lie, say that she was a wonderfully good woman.
And that'll be my heaven.
- Now will you ask him to come up?
- At once.
Sister, the young man is blind.
I've told him that this is a sanitarium.
You must be careful.
They will. They understand.
Come.
Take care of the steps.
Madame, I'm leaving the door open so that the visitor won't hear the rattle of the lock.
Bless you.
Alexis.
Come, nurses. We'll look at the patient in the next room...
...and leave these young people alone.
- Thank you, doctor.
This is most irregular.
And after the operation, how much longer will you have to stay here?
I don't know.
- I'll be well soon, I hope.
- Of course you will.
- And so will I.
- What?
The doctors say now that with time and the right treatment...
...there is every chance I'll see again.
See you again.
That's the one thing I needed to give me strength.
Mata, you are telling me the truth?
It isn't a dangerous operation?
No. No, it's very slight, really.
And in a short time, we'll forget all this and be so happy.
Just the same, I can't bear to think of you suffering.
- Alexis?
- Yes.
- Promise me you won't worry about me.
- Oh, Mata, please.
Now, promise me.
You know what operations are.
Even the slightest, there's always a chance.
Promise me.
If something should happen to me...
...you won't grieve too much, that you'll carry on.
But nothing will happen to you.
You mustn't be afraid.
Well, then hold me.
I won't be afraid if you hold me.
Is it time?
The doctor and the nurses, they've come to take me.
Already? Why need it be so early?
Well, they always operate early in the morning.
And the sooner I go, the sooner it's over.
All right, but you mustn't be frightened.
I'll wait right here till they bring you back.
No, no. I don't want you to.
Monsieur caron is waiting to take you back.
He'll let you know just how I am.
- Very soon.
- You are afraid.
- No.
- You needn't be. I've been through it.
The anesthetic is unpleasant, but that's all.
- Goodbye, my beloved.
- Oh, you sound so tragic.
- Goodbye, my beloved. Is that better?
- Yes, darling.
Courage. Courage, my dear. Be brave.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
God, save her. Protect her.
And if you must take her, take me too.
[ENGLISH]
Richard Bogard.
- Yes.
American, eh?
- Yes, sir.
You got a bit more than you bargained for crossing, what?
Your torpedo was actually fired.
Good show, eh. Nice to have watched, for you Americans.
Well, I hope you don't see more than you want.
Purpose of visit?
Just looking around.
Sympathies in the war?
None, that is ..
- Neutral. That's all.
You've passed.
And there.
I am sure the place will meet with your requirements.
When would you like possession?
Just as soon as they are willing to vacate.
They will be happy to do so at once.
The owner is at the front.
Naturally, his income has stopped.
His son is in training and only the daughter is left.
I feel rather like a villain throwing the daughter out and that sort of thing.
It must be rather difficult for her.
England is at war, Mr Bogard.
There is the address.
Father.
Oh.
The gentleman is here, Miss.
Mr Bogard the name is.
I'll send him away, Miss?
- No.
No, I'll see him.
- No, Miss. No.
It's ..
It's a long way from London and .. he ..
He might not want to come back again.
When I ring for the tea.
No blubbering.
Mind not.
Miss Boyce-Smith?
- Yes.
My name is Bogard.
How do you do.
I have just been admiring your view.
Those old trees. They are very old, aren't they.
Yes, very.
This is just like I hoped it would be.
You've lived here all your life have you?       - Yes.
I thought so.
You seem to fit in somehow.
Are these your brothers?
Yes. One of them.
That's my father.
Yes. They told me he was in service.
- Yes.
Shall we have tea?
Yes. Thank you.
Cigarette?
- Thank you.
You know, I'm just beginning to realize what this is all about.
We don't know there is a war going on, we Americans.
No.
It's getting pretty close to you with your father .. and brother.
And now a stranger moving in.
Is tea ready?
Yes .. Miss.
Thank you.
I suppose now that you are giving up your home.
You are going away?
No.
No, I've moved my things to the gardener's cottage on The Place.
Oh.
I see.
Please don't worry about me, Mr Bogard.
I'll be quite alright.
Thank you.
How will you have your tea?
Just sugar please.
Will you fetch the sugar, Wendy.
- Yes.
It's there, Miss.
Thank you.
How many?
I've been very stupid.
I forgot that your sugar was rationed.
I've already put it in.
You have so little.
Why do you give it to me?
Why shouldn't you have it?
I'm sorry. I couldn't drink it now.
Shall I show you the rest of the house?
Thanks.
Is .. that the library?
That is my father's study.
May I see it?
Of course.
This is perfect.
You shoot too?
Sometimes.
Hello boy.
Your father's?
- Yes.
He's even burnt the table with cigarettes.
That's what a study is for, isn't it.
Do as you please.
Be comfortable.
Must you do that?
Must you?
Sorry. I didn't ..
- Oh, don't.
I'm the one to apologize.
You see .. it's only because ..
This has always been my father's room and ..
I'm not going to ask you to show me any more.
I've been thoughtless. I didn't realize.
I promise to take good care of all these.
If you .. excuse me.
Please make yourself comfortable.
As to the room.
I only hope you enjoy it.
My father did.
Look here.
Everybody seems to be rather upset about my coming.
If the servants worry about losing their jobs, tell them I'll keep them will you.
It isn't that, sir.
It's the master.
They've just had word that he's been killed.
What?
I see.
Men of England. Hail.
Your bodies are buried in peace.
But your name liveth for evermore.
I gave them permission, Diana.
They asked me if you'd mind.
Mind?
No.
Not tonight.
Just when I think I can't cry anymore.
I haven't any tears left.
I surprise myself.
Again.
Oh, he was so fine.
Why did he have to go? Why?
I've answered that question as many times as there are names there.
And the answer satisfies no-one.
Not even me.
I don't know, but ..
There are times in the lives of women even more than in those of men.
When they must have a sublime, unreasoning faith.
But I haven't any faith.
I don't even hope.
Just a lot of silly tears that come rushing out.
When I least expect.
Father is dead.
There is room for more names.
Soon, Ronnie and Claude will be there too.
They haven't gone yet, Diana.
His name is Ronnie. Your brother.
Mine is Claude.
Little boy from next door.
Ronnie.
Ronnie.
Thanks.
I shan't be satisfied with this long arm. Demand my rights.
Claude.
Padre, hello.
I can hardly believe that you're here.
I've something to show you.
The village did it for father.
Remember the time you slipped with the communion wine, Ronnie?
It was just there.
Under the plate by old Daddy's pew.
And father passed the empty glass.
All down the way as if nothing had happened.
Dad gave me his hymn book to hide my sniggering.
He laughed after it was all over.
I wonder what he'd say.
If he knew we were shoving off in five hours.
He'd say:
"It's worth a world war to get a uniform like that".
Or he'd say: "Five hours? How can the Admirals spare you?"
"A grand celebration and talk of .."
- "Cabbages and Kings."
And give us his best wine.
- And drink us all under the table.
Five hours, Ann.
Five hours?
How can the Admirals spare you?
Then we're off.
Tea, Padre?
- No thanks.
This time belongs to you.
- You are family, you know.
Yes, thanks. I'll say goodbye now.
Good luck.
Good luck.
- Thanks.
Say one of your best prayers for us, Padre.      - I will that.
How do you find your American, Ann?
Oh.
Rich.
Neutral.
Out of things.
Sort-of safe.
This is home now.
Jolly, isn't it.
I'll go say hello to Applegate.
- Oh Ronnie, wait a minute.
You'd better not. You'd better let me tell her first.
I'll need this.
Upstairs if you want to tidy up.
I say Ann, I hope you didn't rent all the Scotch to the American.
I should say not. I'll get some.
Applegate.
- Hmm?
Ronnie and Claude are here.
Oh.
Here. Now time just for a quick one. Come on.
They go tonight.
Going, Miss?
- Yes.
Going? Oh, Miss ..
- I said a quick one.
Besides, they go at nine.
Who's going to get dinner?
I am, Miss.
Poor lambs.
Half starved. That's what they is.
Applegate.
When they go.
Mind not.
I won't mind, Miss.
I don't need this anymore.
Stout fellow.
Hear, hear.
Hey. Hey, get out of here will you.
Will not.
Of course, you're a big girl now.
I'm starting tomorrow morning bright and early being a big girl.
I haven't time now.
Hey, bartender.
Thank you, milady.
- Right.
He's still a kid to you, isn't he.
Why not?
You think just because you wear an officer's tunic you're grown up?
Ann.
Hmm?
This morning, when commissions and orders came.
He said, get Ronnie.
Officer now. Navy.
Now I can ask her.
Well?
He counts on it.
Awful knock if you let him down.
Won't let him down.
Good girl.
Ronnie, when you say "good girl" to me.
It feels just like jumping over Robin Hood's barn.
Don't take too much of our five hours will you.
No.
I never thought I'd live to see the day.
There I was.
And the Queen not two feet away.
No further than from here to there.
And talking to me just like I was her sister.
I never thought I'd live to see the day.
That's remarkable, isn't it.
Have another.
Have one yourself.
- That I will.
I've had one already. That makes two.
Hear, hear. I have things to say.
We've no secrets from Ronnie, have we.
Not one.
Remember what we said? That when the time came and I asked you ..
You would say without a lot of fuss ..
"Right, Claude".
Or.
Stay, Claude.
I do.
And we promised whatever you said.
That we three would be just the same.
Yes.
Well?
Well, Ann?
Right, Claude.
Oh, I say.
I say, Ronnie. Did you hear? Did you?
It's "right".
- Told you it would be.
Glad.
I don't know what to do.
I haven't a ring. I should have a ring, shouldn't I, Ann.
We'll trade. Our names are inscribed.
Then each ring will mean two things.
- Good. Good idea.
Here Ronnie, you must be in on this. Yours, Ann.
You ought to say something, Claude.
Something important.
Go ahead. Say it.
I can't think of anything important.
I can only think of silly things.
- Well then, say silly things.
Must say something.
I ..
Say ..
Go ahead.
I know what your father would say.
- Say it.
"The time has come the walrus said, to talk of many things".
"Of shoes and ships and sealing wax, of cabbages and kings."
"And why the sea should boil in .."
[ Clock chimes ]
What hails?
- Drink hearty.
Master Ronnie.
Now take care of her, Applegate.
Make her toe the mark.
You know, girls have no sense.
I know, master Ronnie.
I'll take care of her.
Well.
- Well?
I suppose you want me to kiss you goodbye.
You don't have to if you don't want to.
Guess I'd better.
Better had.
Silly business, though.
Well.
Better finish this by letter.
Train might not wait.
Good girl.
See, Miss .. I didn't cry.
You may cry now.
Hello.
- Hello.
You are late this morning.
- Am I?
Every morning this week you left at ten.
So I waited.
Nice of you.
You don't mind my riding with you?
Not at all.
I'm riding to Valleysmith.
The view from the hill is nice.
Oh, you've seen it?
Naturally.
Of course.
I was going to ask you to ride there with me.
I'm going to the village.
Applegate has lost her darning egg.
Darning egg?
- Uhuh.
She's had it for thirty years.
That's too bad.
- Yes, isn't it.
Valleysmith is that way.
Village over here.
I suppose I ought to say something good about our roads dividing.
Well?
I suppose you can get darning eggs at Valleysmith?
Afraid not.
Cheero.
Is that "cheerio" or "cheero"?
"Cheero".
Well, cheero.
Well .. hello.
Applegate can use a bottle for a darning egg.
My grandmother used to use a little gourd.
It rattled.
Do you find England like America?
Countries are such silly things, aren't they.
Just places on maps with ..
Exports and tariffs and queer places to visit.
They don't mean much to you until you get tied up with them through people.
I thought the war was silly, too.
Never believed in it until now.
Does that mean ..
You're going in?
If they'll let me.
Why?
Because I love you.
I was going to say it a little further along.
Kinda work up to it.
Talking about England.
But I do love you.
I know it.
Cheero.
Ann.
Please.
Please forget what I told you this afternoon.
I'll never forget it.
Because I love you too.
What time did she leave?
She took the evening train to
London, sir. In an awful hurry.
And you don't know where they were going?    - No, sir.
No more did she.
It's the ambulance service.
She hopes she'll be sent somewhere near her brother.
She'll write back, sir.
Goodnight, Mrs Applegate.
Look, Ronnie!
Hi, sailors.
Ronnie .. you're here.
On the way up I kept saying you wouldn't be, you couldn't be here.
So I wouldn't be disappointed.
The Admiral's sub couldn't have kept us away.    - Yes.
He made us run the last
4 squares to get here.
Did you, Ronnie?
Aren't you going to kiss me?
What for? Never kissed you in my life.
Look at you.
You dress up to meet me?
What you look like every day.
No time, Ann.
You should have seen us scraping the mud off this gold braid.
Listen. I'll report and
I'll be right with you.
Different already, isn't it.
Here it is.
Got the key?
- Hmm.
Well, as Applegate would say, I never thought I would live to see the day.
Room fit for a Queen.
All the comforts of home.
Every convenience milady.
Ah .. Chippendale.
Illumination.
I wonder what's in here.
- Find out.
What-oh, feather beds.
Running water. Cold and colder.
Hey.
- What?
A nest of mice. Non-nibblers.
Beaver! Look, Anne. Help me.
- What is it?
Cockroach. There he goes, up your way.
- Quick, quick.
Where?
- Get him.
Get him, Ann.
- He's heading back to you, Claude.
Here he is. Here he is.
There he goes, there he goes. There.
Don't hurt him.
- No, I won't.
I have him.
I have him.
Ah, he's a beauty.
- Looks like a born fighter, eh.
Who will he fight?
Remember Jamie Wetherspoon?
- Hmm.       - He has a roach.
The best fighter in the division.
They're betting 3-1 on him.
I'd bet on this fellah.
Bring him out.
- Okay.
Ronnie, get a glass. Quickly. Quickly.
There. Got him.
- Hmm.
Jamie calls his "Bonaparte".
Have to get a name for this one. What will it be?
Bonaparte?
Duke or Duchess?
The Duke Of Wellington.
Wellington.
That's just the thing.
Two nice things in one day, Ann.
You and Wellington.
Refuse to share honours with a cockroach.
We'll drink to you first.
- Nice of you.
I'll get a bottle and we'll celebrate?
- Right.
Don't move.
Stay here.
Just like that.
I'll come back pretending you're not here.
And there you'll be.
It will be fun all over again, won't it.
- Yes.
Fun all over again.
Stay there.
I'll be right back.
They don't make them any better, do they.
No.
Poor Ronnie.
Ronnie, what is it?
- Nothing .. sore.
You've been hit?
- Nicked a bit.
Alright now. Almost well.
Oh Ronnie.
- Steady.
It's been bad?
How bad has it been?
- No lark.
Not so bad for me. Worse for Claude.
You've never written what you do you know.
I couldn't. The censor.
It's hush-hush stuff.
Silly. I'll tell you later why.
Do you often run into this sort of thing?
Sometimes show gets pretty warm.
Tell me about Claude.
- Told you.
I'm alright.
I'm older. Dull.
Claude's not dull. He's quick.
He's missed you, Ann. Lots.
It's always Ann with Claude.
He drinks too much.
You're here now.
Yes.
Yes, I'm here now.
And you need me.
Both of you.
You do need me, don't you?
- Hmm.
Something to tell me, Ann?
You always know, don't you, Ronnie.
What is it?
The chap that took the house.
I love him.
Thought so.
Your letters.
I couldn't help it, Ronnie.
I tried, but ..
- You can't help feelings, Ann.
You can't change love.
You'd have liked him too, Ronnie.
I know you would.
Sure I would.
You'd not have liked him yourself otherwise.
But it's all over now.
Finished.
I have you and Claude and ..
I don't want anything else.
Truly I don't.
Claude's young.
Time to get over it.
I didn't want you to say that.
I wanted you to understand.
I do.
Then don't ask me to let Claude down.
Not when things are like they are.
Stop feeling them.
That's what I wanted you to say.
Say it again.
Ronnie.
He kissed me.
Right.
Steady now.
Hi, sailor.
Hi.
Ann.
In here.
Hello.
- Hello.
Get enough sleep?
Do we ever?
- No.
How about a cup of tea?
- Had mine.
I meant how about my poaching a cup.
- In there.
Pretty strong by now.
Don't need it strong this morning.
Another day of it, they say.
Three days now.
Wounded coming in in car loads.
I don't know where they'll put them.
They're turning the churches into hospitals.
Hello.
- Hello.
Have a cup of tea or what was tea?
- No thanks.
May I speak with Ann a minute?
Of course.
Don't be long though, Ann.
We're late now.
Is it ..?
Is it Claude?
No, not Claude.
Is it ..?
"Richard Bogard."
Richard.
He's dead before I even learned to say his name.
Coming, Ann?
Waiting for you.
Ronnie.
Ronnie, I can't go.
Really, I can't.
Yes you can.
It's no good, Ronnie. Can't.
Ronnie, don't make me go, please.
Ronnie, don't. Don't make me go.
Please. Can't.
Ronnie.
I can't.
That's a terrible looking hat, Ann.
Dropped it in the soup.
Yesterday.
Good girl.
Boulogne is pretty hot at this time, Ronnie.
We tried though.
One thousand capsules 5-grain quinine.
Thirty gallons disinfectant.
Four dozen dark-eyed glasses.
Twelve gross diphtheria antitoxin.
Ten thousand units.
Twelve gross ..
Forget it.
Twelve gross tetanus antitoxin.
Fifteen thousand units.
Twelve boxes hypodermic needles.
Ann.
"Donald Osborne, aged 19."
What will I say this time?
What difference does it make?
No matter what you say it will break her heart.
Twelve only surgical gloves.
Ten gallons, tincture of iodine.
Ten gallons tincture of iodine.
Stop it.
I just told the poor mother her "iodine" has been killed.
Five gross safety pins.
Five only safety razors.
Alright girls. Need more help. Coming in faster than we can handle them.
Get out and get all the stretchers down to the north face.
I can't.
I can't go out there.
Yes you can.
Come on.
Goodnight, Alma.
Goodnight, Ann.
Goodnight, Mary.
Come on, youngsters.
Sailor.
Sailor.
Four o'clock, sailor.
I know.
Shouldn't have done this.
I broke my promise and drank too much.
I'm alright now, though.
Do you go out again tomorrow?
Uhuh.
What is it this time?
Don't know yet.
Special.
Special means "bad", doesn't it.
Maybe.
I can't tell yet.
Is it tomorrow's job, Claude?
Is that why you ..
Why you waited for me?
It's not that alone.
It's lots of things.
I'm not holding together, Ann.
I'm all mixed up.
No secrets.
Have we Claude?
- I'm afraid, Ann.
Afraid of what?
Going out in the boat.
I think about .. coming back to you.
Just the way I did coming from school.
You were always there, waiting.
But lately, it's different.
I don't know.
You've gone away somewhere.
Not here.
Then.
There's nothing to come back to.
Claude.
Ann is here again.
Always will be.
Always.
No-one in the world I love so much.
Except Ronnie.
Believe me, sailor?
Sure?
Sure.
Come along.
Have Lieutenants Boyce-Smith and Hope come in yet?
Not yet, Miss. Just had a telephone from the lookout.
Said one of the boats has just entered the harbour.
Maybe it's them, Miss.
- Thank you.
Get a stretcher will you.
- Yes, sir.
Stretcher needed. Stretcher.
There you go, Bert.
- Aye-aye, sir.
What's the matter with you? Get the stretcher down. Hurry up.
Ronnie, are you alright?
- Hello, Ann.
Alright. Up in a moment.
Steady there.
Here you are, boys.
- Alright.
Anyone else in yet?
- Mr Witherspoon, sir.
Trust Jamie.
He always gets the first drink.
Bert, look here.
- Aye-aye, sir.
Better see to that before you leave.
Aye-aye, sir.
Ronnie.
Hello.
- Hello.
Make a hit?
- Yes.      - Glad.
Been waiting.
I was ..
Ronnie.
May I speak with Claude a moment?
Right.
Did you tell him?
- No.
I wanted to.
Suppose he hates it?
We must tell him.
We've no secrets.
- Right.
I'll tell him.
- No.
It's my due.
We'll be married as soon as it's all over.
If it ever is.
Ronnie.
Remember when we were tykes?
Messing about the brook and all?
She said she would marry me.
You remember.
How we all said it. All three of us.
And then when we were bigger.
How we talked about it being in the chapel.
Padre.
And veils and wreaths.
The music of the voice that breathes over Eden.
You remember.
We were still children then, Ronnie.
We're not children anymore.
She's not. I'm not.
That chapel and Padre seem a million miles away.
There is no Eden any more.
And to wear, it's khaki .. not veils.
We didn't wait, Ronnie.
I know it.
Ronnie.
You knew?
- Uhuh.
And.
And you don't ..
You don't hate me?
Hate?
Ronnie.
That's twice you've kissed me.
[ Buzzer ]
[ Buzzer ]
Who can that be, I wonder.
Alright, alright. I'm coming.
Just give a body a chance.
[ Buzzer ]
Yes, I'm coming.
If you could only see me.
If you could see me coming, you wouldn't need to ring.
Now what do you ..?
Mr Bogard. Mr Bogard.
Hello, Mrs Applegate.
- Mr Bogard.
Ain't you a ghost? You're dead, sir.
Nope. They overestimated me.
Ann? I came to see her.
Lord, Lordy, sir. I'm very sorry.
Why we thought you was dead, sir.
Does that feel dead?
Come. Pull yourself together,
Applegate. I'm in a hurry.
I came to find out about Miss Ann.
She's in France, sir.
Miss Ann, my own dovey, being shot at by them Germans.
Yes. I know she is in France, but where?
I don't know, sir.
When we writes, we addresses the letters to the Officer's Unit in Boulogne.
It's a private unit, sir.
I see. And her brother ..?
Well he is where she is, sir.
And Mr Claude, too.
Wherever you'll find one of them, you'll find the other two, sir.
I see.
Lord, sir. I thought you was a ghost.
I never thought I'd live to see the day.
Sit down, Bogey.
Walking around won't help any.
What is it?
- He wants whiskey, sir.
Why don't you get it?
There, what did I tell you? Any guy that wants whiskey ain't dead, is he.
No, but ..
- Oh shut up. Sit down.
Sit down. Go on, go on. Anybody would think it was your fault.
That's three front gunners in two weeks.
Miller and Jordan last week and now ..
Davis. In there.
Forget it. It's not your fault about Davis.
Anybody would think you hunted up those Huns and flew right into them.
Besides, Davis is not gone yet.
Not gone yet?
Did you see the blood coming out of his mouth when they pulled him out of there?
Well .. go on. Say it.
Hello, Bogey. Can you use this?
Richard.
Don't be afraid, Ann.
Richard.
Oh, Richard.
Oh, they told me you were dead.
And I believed them.
Just now, I thought I was dead too.
But we're not.
We're alive.
Richard, we're alive.
It was when the ship spun and the controls were gone.
And afterwards in the hospital.
I was listening to them say
I'd die. I knew I wouldn't.
I couldn't. Not without seeing you.
- Oh, darling.
Darling.
I dreamed once that you were alive.
That you were calling to me.
I tried to answer.
I woke internally.
Richard.
Why did they tell me you were dead?
You're not dead after all.
But I am.
Stop it.
Stop it.
- No. Let me go.
Let me go.
- Wait a minute, Bogey. Wait.
Look at me.
- No.
Look Miss. I don't know what it's all about.
But I do know it's time to cut the motors and stall her down.
You're telling him "no". Is that it?
Is that right?
I'm trying to tell him ..
Well that sounds final enough.
You'd better go, Miss. Go on.
Go on .. go on.
Wait, Ann.
- Wait, Bogey.
She doesn't want you to follow her. Anyone can see that.
Now take it easy ..
- Let go of me, let go of me!
Hold it will you. Hold it.
Now Listen, take it easy. Take time.
Think it over. Then, if you want ..
We can find her. It's a cinch.
She's in Ambulance.
We'll go to town tonight.
Come on, I need a drink too.
Come on.
Look at all these trucks. You're blocking the road down there.
Come on, will you.
Come on.
Come on, come on.
- Scram, you guys.
Get right out of here.
- Come on.
What's the trouble, Corporal?
Stand up. They're officers.
Your name is not Beatty, I hope.
No.
- Hoped not.
My mistake.
No offence.
- What's he been doing?
Well you see, sir. Them trucks was jammed up for about three blocks.
Then I come up and find this egg here.
You're talking about one of his
Majesty's officers, my man.
That will do, Corporal.
Well I find this ..
He had gone to bed in the middle of the road with an empty basket for a blanket.
Laying there with hands under his head and knees crossed ..
Arguing with the drivers whether he ought to move or not.
He said the street was his.
Why don't you take him back to the ship?
- I thought of that.
He said he puts the ship away at night.
Puts it away?
- Yes, sir.
Stand up, sailor.
Maybe the Captain can make sense out of it.
Darned if I can.
He says they keep the boat under a wharf at night ..
And can't get it out until the tide goes out in the morning.
Under a wharf? A boat?
- Yes, sir.
What is this?
You've seen those launches, camouflaged and all, dashing up and down the harbour?
They do that all day and sleep in the gutters here all night.
You mean to say they use officers to ..
Search me. Maybe they use them to fetch hot water from one ship to another.
Or to carry napkins for the Admiral or something like that. I don't know.
I see.
Alright Corporal, carry on.
This man will take care of him.
Hey, dog-face.
You take him.
And I hope you'll keep him from using the street for a bed.
That will do, Corporal.
You know where he lives?
- Probably a place up the road, sir.
You come to the crossroad, turn into a little court and count four houses.
Come, Bogey. We'll get him home. Won't take long.
Why bother with him?
He's just a kid. I got a brother about his age. Come on, take his other arm.
Come on, now. Upsy-daisy.
Upsy-daisy. That's the baby.
See the little birdie?
See it?
He's sure got a beauty.
Maybe they give 'em the little boats to play with ..
To keep the gutters clear during the day.
Come on.
Yeah, this it. Come on, buddy.
Ann?
They told us ..
It's a mistake of course.
We were looking ..
Come on, Bogey. Let's get him in.
No, wait. We've made a mistake. This isn't ..
Go on, sister. Tell him and get it over with.
No .. it isn't a mistake.
This is the right place.
Bring him in.
- Sure.
Where to, sister?
So this is what you meant when you said you'd died.
Well, he's not dead at any rate.
And he's not likely to be hurt in that little boat of his.
Sorry, sister.
Come on, Bogey.
You take a lot of killing, don't you. Come on.
Come on.
Short, sweet and promising, eh?
- Yes.
Hey Bogey, you see this?
- Yes.
What's the idea of drawing lots in secret?
Just a new way to kill a guy, maybe.
Not a bad idea at that. Keep it secret.
May not even know yourself you're dead.
Come on, Bogey.
- Where you going?
Town.
- Wait. I'll go with you.
Thanks, just the same.
Come on, Wellington.
At him again, Wellington.
Well struck!
Come on, Wellington.
Come on Wellington, my boy.
Wellington wins!
A good fight, eh?
Hello.
I say, you're the chaps who took me home last night, aren't you.
I guess I was out of it and didn't have a chance to thank you.
I can do it now.
May I get you a drink?
Sure.
- Come on.
Take care of Wellington for me, will you.         - Right.
Madame.
Whiskey, whiskey. One, two, three.
Whiskey.
Ha. Speak French like a native, eh.
Oh I say, you fly don't you?
- Yes.
I've never flown myself.
Been on a mountain though.
Liked being high.
Flying.
A risky sport, eh?
Yes. Sport.
- A bit dangerous isn't it?
A little more than being on a mountain.
Yet you command a vessel.
Well, it's hardly a vessel.
Nice, though.
I'm not in command. Ronnie does that.
He ranks me a bit.
- Ronnie?
Yes, the chap I run with.
Good egg. Bit of a stickler though.
A stickler?
Yes. You'd not believe it, but whenever we sight smoke.
And I have the glass, he always sheers away.
He keeps the ship held down, you know.
I can't get a beaver then.
He's had me two down for a fortnight.
Down? Beaver?    - Yes.
- What do you mean?
He means: beaver.
Bottoms up.
- Right.
Well you see, we play it with basket masks.
Whenever you see a basket mask, why: beaver. You're one up.
The JurgenStrasse doesn't count anymore.
I see.
So when you or Ronnie see a ship with a basket mask.
One gets the beaver on the other, huh?
- Right.
What is the JurgenStrasse?
Oh, she's a German, interned in the harbour.
Her fore-mast is rigged something like a basket.
You know, booms and cables and whatnot.
Ronnie called 'em once. They shifted her across the bay. I called her on Ronnie.
So we decided not to count her any more, see.
I see.
You and Ronnie run about in a launch and play beaver.
Did you ever play ..
Take your hand away.
Sure I will .. when?
Get me?
You've never flown you say?
- No.
Always wanted to, though.
- Should you like to try it?
Should I?
You mean it?
When?
Now. Tonight.
- Should I?
I say, wait. I'll get Wellington.
What's the idea?
What are you going to do?
I'm going to show him something about war.
Oh lay off. I mean it. He's just a kid.
He's old enough to know what it's all about.
Here we are getting shot at by the clock and it's not even our fight.
Shut up. You sound like a liberty law.
He's treating it like it's a tea party or something.
I'd like to catch him and his Ronnie.
Out on the harbour sometime.
Any harbour.
I wouldn't want anything but a Jenny either.
A Jenny.
I'll take a bicycle and a pair of water wings. I'll show him some war.
Sure, sure. Take him along. Let him have
Davis's place up in the front cockpit.
That would be just swell.
- But Mack.
I know you don't want him hurt and he's taking the same chances as we are but ..
But what?
Ah well.
- Here we are.
Wellington has never flown either. Look at him.
A big fellow isn't he.
You don't know who I am, do you.
Yes. The chap who fetched me home last night.
I thanked you.
I can thank you again though.
- My name I mean.
No.
It's Bogard.
Bogard?
You're the chap who took the house aren't you?
They reported you dead.
You're not dead .. I'm glad.
No, I'm not dead.
Shall we start?
- Right.
Remember, you've done this before.
Have I?
Oh, quite. Yes.
Fellows.
This is Lieutenant Hope.
He is going up with me.
This is Moore, Skipworth, Jenkins.
- How do you do.
Morehouse.
- Hello.
Alexander.
- Hello.    - Rondell.
I hope you enjoy.
- I'm sure I will.
Pretty decent of you chaps to let me go for a ride.
Drink?
Yes, thanks.
Get him some gear, will you.
Ready on the line, sir.
Alright fellows, hit the deck.
Hit the deck.
Here you are, Bogey,
- Thanks.
Here, Hope. Put this on.
Oh, shall I need it? Never worn one before you know.
Sure. Cold upstairs.
Don't talk. They'll get wise.
Oh.
Say, it will keep Wellington cosy, what.
Yeah, absolutely.
Where's the Admiral from, Bogey?
The Scotch Navy, usually.
There you are kid, you're alright.
Take care of that.
- Do you want coffee, sir?
No he doesn't. Get something else for tonight.
Coffee makes a confounded stain on the wings.
The wings?
You pour coffee on the wings?
- You'll see ..
Let’s do it, Mack. Come on.
Give me a bottle, Dave.
This is ours. I'll be with you in a minute. Mack will show you in.
Come on.
I say, it's big isn't it.
- What?
I say it’s big.
Yeah.
I can't believe it flies all in one lump.
It does.
You ride up front.
Bogey and I are here.
Harper protects the tail.
Now listen.
If you feel yourself getting sick.
Take a pull of this.
Shall I get sick?
- Sure.
We all do. Part of flying.
This will stop it.
But if it doesn't.
- What?
Don't spew it overside.
Not overside?
- No.
Blows back in Bogey's and my faces.
We can't see. Bingo.
We're finished. See?
Oh, quite.
What shall I do with it?
Just duck your head and let her go.
I say, that will be in my lap.
Quite. See.
Quite.
- Alright.
Get down there.
Lean forward.
That's the Vickers gun.
The gunnery Sergeant will be along in a minute.
He'll show you how to load it.
Hey!
It's loaded.
Oh, it's alright.
I pointed it west before I let it off.
There's nothing back there but your Brigade Headquarters.
By the way, my name is Claude.
I don't think I told you.
Oh, this is going to be swell.
I hope everything is working out just the way you wanted it to.
There isn't a Hun squadron between the coast and Ypres ..
That hasn't already already drawn lots for us.
They've shaved, eaten breakfast and sit round waiting to get us on the way back.
[ German language ]
[ German language ]
[ German language ]
He's not even scared.
I am, though. Plenty.
Come on, get out of here.
We had no business going so low.
I ought to report you.
Go ahead and report.
Huh?
Bomb.
Bomb.
It hangs loose.
Ah, sit down.
Tell him to stand by his guns.
Get back.
- A bomb.
Yeah. They were bombed.
We gave them all we had.
Get back to your guns.
Bomb alright?
- Yeah, alright.
Get back to your guns.
- Right.
Wellington.
- What?
Wellington likes this.
- Get back to your guns.
Daylight soon.
Every Hun and their whole channel group will be on us then.
Want me to take her?
Something's wrong with that left wing.
I'm flying on aileron and a little rudder.
Feel it.
Maybe your wire is hot.
Watch it. Keep that wing up.
Here they come.
They look like mosquitoes in September.
I hope he don't start letting that gun flop around and shoot back this way.
Sorry.
See what he said? He said: "I'm sorry".
I say, what a chap.
What a judge of distance.
If Ronnie could only have seen it. Are they like ours?
Do they load themselves as soon as the air strikes them?
What? Don't what load?
- The bomb. It's magnificent.
I shan't ever forget it.
The bomb?
That left wing.
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.
I was frightened myself.
I tried to tell you of it but realized you knew your business better than I.
Skill .. marvellous.
I say, I shan't ever forget it.
Oh, Mack.
They got Wellington.
I waited. Did you find him?
I looked in a café.
They said he'd been there.
Went out with some air-chap.
American. Can't understand.
Ronnie.
It was Bogard.
Bogard?
Yes.
Wasn't killed.
Mistake.
Met him at the hospital.
Told him it was over.
Not why, though.
That night he brought Claude home.
He hated me.
Hated Claude too.
Thought Claude was "safe".
Thought about the boat like everybody else.
His face.
Ronnie, it's safe .. looking at me.
He didn't understand.
Oh Ronnie.
I have to let go to you.
I've no-one else.
Let go.
Oh, I loved him.
Can't help it.
Tried, tried terribly.
Stop trying, Ann.
Stop trying?
Can't help feelings.
Claude's young. He'll get over it.
Tell him "mistake Claude".
Too late.
It's past that.
I only want him to understand.
I only want not to remember his face as it was.
Hating me.
That's all I want, Ronnie.
Friends, brothers, elks and beavers.
I come before you
not to bury Wellington.
But to praise him.
Hear, hear.
We are gathered together on this solemn occasion to bid farewell ..
Farewell?
Farewell.
I can't stand it, Lieutenant. I can't.
Have a drink.
I can't stand much more of it either.
- Audrey.
To the only cockroach in the allied armies who fought Richthofen.
Now we'll have the doxology.
Johnny.
Johnny, get back there and play it as you've never played before.
Make it good, boys. Make it good.
[ Singing: ]
"Under a Belgian water tank, the young observer lay."
"As his comrades gathered about him."
"These parting words he did say."
Say, Bogey.
Somebody wants to see you.
Thanks.
Captain Bogard?
I'm Boyce-Smith.
Hello.
I was looking for Hope here, and I see he's alright.
Why did you look for him here?
- My sister said he'd be here.
She told you that?
- Yes.
What else did she tell you about me?
I apologise. I shouldn't have asked that.
Thanks.
I say, will you ..
Will you come with us on the boat today?
Did Ann ..?
Did your sister tell you to ask me that?
Yes.
Why do you want me to come?
Did you tell Claude why?
You're right .. I'll come.
At two, what. I'll leave word with the sentry to pass you in to port.
I'll be there.
I want you to meet my friend, McGinnis.
A beaver, what?
So .. so you're going to spend the afternoon with the children, eh?
Or should I say "eh what"?
Some guy has said that a brave man is a fool who don't know when to be scared.
Meaning which?
Go on, finish.
That's all. I never even said it.
I was only going to remark I'd have showed him what the war was like.
Well then, don't.
- Sure.
Excuse me for stepping on your toes, General.
You haven't. Just shut up.
- Sure, General.     - And stay shut up.
Sure, General. Excuse me, General.
Have a nice time, General.
Lieutenant Boyce-Smith.
Down at the boat, sir.
Oh, just a minute, sir.
From Lieutenant McGinnis for the Captain, sir.
Hello there.
Well, here she is.
So you came. Thanks.
Did you think I wouldn't?
Or don't you go out in the rain?
Oh, it doesn't matter much. Come aboard.
Careful.
Take that little seat up forward.
Not much to look at is she.
Do the best we can.
Shall we shove off?
Any time.
Ready forward?
- Aye-aye, sir.
Ready aft?
- Aye-aye, sir.
Cast off.
Cast off, men.
Look. See?
What? See what?
The JurgenStrasse.
They've shifted her again.
If Ronnie would only call her I'd just be one down.
He didn't see it. Maybe he will on the way back, though.
You've got lots of time.
- Yes.
He's been ahead since we were ten years old.
Always ahead.
I've cut it to two now though.
I only hope he sees it.
I say, will you be warm? I never thought to fetch another one of these.
I'm alright.
- Here.
No, no. I won't take it.
You'll tell me if you get cold?
- Yes. Sure.
Are we outside now?
- Yes.
I mean, are we outside the harbour?
Quite. Where do you think we went?
Listen. Where are we going? How far?
It's Ronnie's show. He thought of it.
I told him about last night.
He said: "flying all night".
"That must have been to Berlin".
I said I didn't know.
Well he thought and I waited.
I said we couldn't take you to Berlin in a boat.
It's too far. Besides, we don't know the way.
He said: but we could go to Kiel.
I knew then ..
- To Kiel, in this?
Oh, absolutely. Ronnie said no fun for you unless we did.
Listen.
What is this boat for?
What does it do?
For?
- Yes.
That's a torpedo, isn't it?
I thought you knew.
- No. I didn't know.
How do you fire it?
Well, you pull this lever here and it drops out astern.
As soon as the screw touches the water ..
The torpedo is loaded.
And all you have to do is turn the boat quickly.
And the torpedo goes on.
I see.
You aim the torpedo with the boat.
And release it. Then if you don't turn out of the way, it's just too bad, huh?
I knew you'd catch on.
Ready?
Yes. Ready.
The channel into the harbour.
Full of mines.
A pattern on all sides and beneath us too.
Englander torpedo boat.
[ German language ]
[ German language ]
Fire.
Two.
Three.
Look.
Beaver.
You old mutt. Now I'm three down again.
What is it?
It didn't go that time.
Right. Ronnie, get it for me.
All clear, Ronnie.
Ready!
Take him, will you.
Alright, Bert?
- Aye-aye, sir.
Where are we?
We're inside the harbour now.
How do you feel?
Oh .. I say.
What is it? Your eyes hurting too?
No. No, they're alright.
Did Ronnie notice?
Notice what?
The JurgenStrasse.
That they had shifted her.
No. He didn't notice.
Shall I pass the word for stretcher bearers, sir?
No. Never mind.
Make fast, then go ashore.
- Aye-aye, sir.
We'll go to the base and see about your head.
It's alright.
Hardly notice it.
- It ought to be attended to.
Right.
Do it when we report.
Will you .. shake hands?
- Right.
Just one thing more.
Will you let me talk to
Ann for just a moment?
Why not?
Why not?
Thank you.
Thanks.
I say, Ronnie.
I can't see.
I thought so.
The fastest ..
Yet, Ronnie.
The harbour might be full of strange ships.
That have come in since we left.
I can't see them.
Beaver!
You mutt. You did it!
And I made you do it.
The JurgenStrasse isn't it.
Isn't it?
Uhuh.
- Ronnie.
I'm just two down now.
Ronnie.
He was here. He left this.
Coming back today, later.
He says here that he understands.
He will understand, won't he Ronnie?
Please say that he will.
Yes, Ann.
He came with us on the boat.
Dear Ronnie.
You always make everything right.
It is right. Isn't it, Ronnie?
I know now that it is.
And Claude will know too.
I can tell him now, can't I?
Not yet.
Wasn't wrong this morning.
Wrong now. Things have changed.
Claude.
Where is he?
- At the doctors.
What is it?
- Eyes.
Left him there. Came to you.
We'll know when we get back.
Knew you'd want to be there if he ..
Of course.
Come along.
I'll see.
Not finished yet.
Why did you bring him here?
He wanted to.
Said find out first.
Decide what to do later.
You wouldn't have brought him here.
If you hadn't been afraid.
Ronnie.
Have you ever ..
Really prayed?
Not until now.
Neither have I.
Sister. Mine.
Your friend, who is another soldier.
Report him to the base authorities.
He is blind.
No hope, ever?
I see.
Ronnie.
Let me.
Sure?
- Uhuh.
Hi, sailor.
Hi.
What do you mean, getting a girl out at this time of night?
Never do it again.
Played the devil this time, didn't you.
A mess, isn't it.
- You're in luck, sailor.
Not dead like Jimmy and Hobart at any rate.
You'll be out in a few months in that boat getting in trouble all over again.
Sailor is ashore for good, Ann.
Lot you know. Doctor knows better.
Funny.
Like this I can see Ann's face clearer than ever.
Is he well enough to come along home with Ann?
Right.
Come along.
Back in a minute, sailor.
Can't talk in there.
Ann.
I only came to apologise.
To ask your pardon for anything that I've said .. or thought.
Today I went out with them .. and now I know why it's all happened.
You wanted me to know, didn't you.
I only wanted to see your face different from what it was that night.
It is different.
Isn't it.
I was trying to hurt you, and them.
I can't hurt them.
Him.
He's a better man at 20 than I am at 27.
He'll be a better man at 27 than I've been.
He loves you, doesn't he.
He always has.
I know.
- No, you don't.
You don't know, Richard.
I told you once, I loved you.
I still do.
No, don't.
Don't touch me.
A few hours ago when you came back.
I thought we could be alive.
To have each other.
It's back, just where it was.
Claude's in there.
His eyes.
He's blind.
What?
Now do you understand?
Blind.
Mack says I'd take a lot of killing.
He should have said it for both of us, shouldn't he.
Back.
Get in any more mischief while I was away?
A bit of thinking, that's all.
That's mischief.
Cigarette?
- No thanks.
Drink?
Ann.
Yes?
Come here.
Not all rain, is it.
Don't for me, Ann.
I'll be alright.
Everything will.
Of course.
You might tell me about that wild ride of yours.
Not much to tell.
The torpedo stuck again.
Shell hit me before second try.
Bogard pulled the lever.
I guess he got more than he bargained for.
A good chap, Ann.
I like him.
Like him a lot.
I like him .. too.
There is the Möhne, surrounded by batteries.
There, there.
There, there.
Anti-aircraft chiefly from the north and the east.
The cruiser lies about here.
A bit more to the north, sir.
That's a dummy there.
- The best approach is from the south.
Now you realize Captain, that cruiser has got to be removed.
Before we can land a single man on the Möhne.
It must be removed at any cost.
Uhuh.
Can you do it?
Yes, sir.
Unless I'm hit directly by accident.
I can get enough height to dive in and drop the bombs before they can stop me.
And then what?
And then what, sir?
Well, it was my suggestion that this thing be done by lots.
But Major Moseley said that you volunteered for it.
Yes, sir.
Very well. That's all.
Good luck.
- Thank you, sir.
I may say there will be a ribbon in it when you ..
If you ..
- We'll appreciate that, sir.
I say.
Wish you luck. May I?
- Thanks.
I'm sorry to hear about ..
I know .. war seems to have a way of doing in good chaps.
I hope you'll get back.
Thanks again.
Ronnie.
- Yes?
Where is Ann?
- In there.
I say Ronnie, don't.
She's sleeping.
Sit down will you. I want to chin a bit.
Smoke?
- Yes, thanks.
Thanks.
About Ann, Ronnie.
She loves him.
How did you ..?
- Sure of it now.
I thought so though, this afternoon.
When he shook hands.
I didn't think you noticed.
- Uhuh.
Noticed.
See better now.
See lots of things.
Just came from the Admiral's.
A silly mess.
What is it?
- You know. Cruiser to be sunk.
Is it on?
- Yes. He's got it.
What?
- Yes. Volunteered to fly in.
Leaves tonight. Be there at dawn.
I say Ronnie, he won't come back. I know. I've flown myself.
That's what Wing Commander said: "Not get back".
But I ..
Ronnie.
Does he know about me?
No.
No lying, now.
Does he?
Yes.
Look, Ronnie.
I'm blind.
Finished.
When this is over I'll be a chap tapping about with a stick.
In everybody's way.
England hard hit too.
Will be when this is over.
America, though.
It's far away.
Seems out of it.
She'd forget.
Children .. and such.
You know what I mean, Ronnie?
- Yes.
Listen, Ronnie.
We know the harbour.
We know the cruiser too.
We could be in and out before they know we're there.
Yes. Thought of that.
Did you, Ronnie?
You would.
You know what I mean then?
- Yes.
I know another thing too.
- What?
You and Ann.
No.
No, Ronnie.
Not love.
Just habit.
War, maybe.
Remember how we talked as children?
Well.
We're not children anymore.
We're grown-ups.
Look.         - What?
- Look at me.
Now say it.
Say what, Ronnie?
- Say it isn't love.
No, it isn't love, Ronnie.
- You're lying.       - No, really.
You're lying.
Ronnie.
What else, Ronnie?
Cheero.
Wait Ronnie. Wait.
I'm going too. What do you think?
- No.
Yes Ronnie. You don't need to see to pull a lever.      - No.
Yes, Ronnie.
Right.
I say Ronnie, can we look in?
Daresn't old chap.
Might wake her, see.
Just a look? Just a moment?
Quiet now.
I promise I shan't move without you.
Are you looking at her, Ronnie?
Look at her while I'm touching you.
Is it now?
- Yes.
Now.
Alright, sir.
- Thank you, Sergeant.
[ Singing: ]
"And a bearing is close to my brain."
"Take the cylinders out of my lungs, boys."
"And assemble the engine .."
Hello teacher. Hello. Come on.
Have a drink. Come on.
No thanks, Mack.
- Come on.
You'd better start drinking water.
Water? Water. Have you forgotten the Johnstown floods?
The poor women, the children.
- Pull yourself together, Mack.
Don't worry about me.
I wouldn't miss it for worlds.
I never been shot at by a battleship.
Something to tell the Sunday
School class back in Podunk.
Clock eh? Beaver what?
And a couple of loons, that's us.
And while I think of it, you know ..
Who took my drink? Give me a drink, Jackson. Give me a drink.
Bring him some coffee, Jackson.
And make him drink it.
Coffee?
Coffee. Do you hear what he said?
Well I guess you'd better do it.
What is it, Bert?
Mr Boyce-Smith and Mr Hope, Miss.
They've gone out on the boat.
They made me and Reece stay ashore and they went off alone.
Why, Mr Hope. He's ..
- Yes, Miss. He could hardly walk.
He was always a fair one for his bottle, but this time ..
But he wasn't drinking. He's blind.
Blind, Miss?
- Where did they go?
I don't know, Miss.
The trip wasn't scheduled.
They gave me this to take to Captain
Bogard, but I thought I'd come to you.
Where may I telephone?
Down the street, Miss. Round the corner.
- Wait a minute.
Ready, Mack?
No, but I guess I'll go.
I'm drawing their money. I ought to do a little something for them.
[ Telephone ]
Hello. Who?
Oh, Captain. Telephone for you.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello. Hello Richard.
It's Ann.
Yes, Ann?
Ronnie and Claude went out on the boat.
Didn't take the men with them.
They left a note for you.
Bert brought it to me.
Open it and read it.
Mack, get everything ready.
Hurry!
Richard.
It says.
It says .. "Take care of Ann".
"Happy landings."
What does it mean, Richard?
It means they're doing a job I ought to be doing. Goodbye, Ann.
God bless you .. goodbye.
[ Whispering ]
Getting close now. Ready?
I smell smoke.
Beaver, Ronnie. Beaver!
Right.
- Ronnie.
Now I'm just one down.
Right you are.
Smoke again.
Beaver, Ronnie.
Right.
Ronnie. We're even now.
I've caught you at last.
We're even now, Ronnie.
- Right.
Ready?
Now!
It didn't go, Ronnie.
The crank. Where is it?
I'll fit the crank.
You hook the cables in.
Try it now, Ronnie.
Got it yet?
Not yet.
No go.
Jammed. Can't get it back.
If I could only see.
What now, Ronnie?
Come up here.
Get out the boat.
Get out?
- They'll pick you up.
Take ä lifebelt. Go overside.
No. You take it.
You can't see.
You can poînt the boat and jump.
I can hold her straight.
- No.
Get off I tell you.
- No.
I rank you. I say: go overside!
No, Ronnie.
Your last chance. You won't?
- Absolutely not.
I'll bet I get there first.
Is it now?
Yes, now!
T-G oö
I wouldn't trust myself in that jungle if it was me, sir.
Well, I will.
We'll leave as soon as we can after Arlington gets here.
- What time is it?
- 2:30 p.m.
What? Then I've got to go down to meet the boat.
Mr. Arlington can have this room when he arrives. I'll use the lean-to.
Righto.
Blimey.
I remember the last time
I was given those orders.
It was when Mr. Parker told me to get that room ready for Miss Jane... the day she arrived.
She stood right in front of that mirror, putting cold cream on her face.
Right where you're standing now.
Beamish, I want you to get Saidi to fix up a bath for Mr. Arlington.
Yes, sir.
- He'll want one as soon as he gets here.
- Righto.
Thank you.
- These are my private quarters.
- Sorry, we didn't mean to intrude.
There was nobody in the store, so we came here.
If you want to buy anything,
Beamish will handle it.
Yes, indeed, we have some lovely things.
Mrs. Cutten was mad about them.
No, we just dropped in for a chat.
That's rather a large safari you're organizing for a hunt.
I haven't time to talk about it now.
I've to meet the boat.
- Sorry.
- Later, perhaps.
Perhaps.
- Couple of nice lads.
- Yes, very.
Keep your eye on the store, Beamish, while I'm away.
You can depend upon me, sir.
- Hiya, Mr. Holt!
- Hello, Edward.
Where's Mr. Arlington?
This is his luggage, but I think he's in his cabin.
- Have some boys take it to the store.
- This minute, sir.
Thanks.
Say, boy, which one is Mr...
- Martin!
- Well, Harry, you old devil!
I thought you'd never get here.
- Easy.
- Softening up a bit?
Wait till I've been here a week, man.
Lip rouge.
Better go back in your room and clean up a bit.
Just a minute. That's not my room.
This is my friend Mr. Holt.
- Madame Feronde, Harry.
- How do you do?
- Charmed, sir.
- Here it is!
- Monsieur, I found your bag.
- Thanks very much.
This is Madame Feronde's husband.
My friend Mr. Holt.
How do you do?
Any friend of Monsieur Arlington, we are so pleased to meet.
My wife says she will never forget the funny stories he's told her.
- Goodbye. Hope you have a nice trip.
- Thank you. Goodbye.
Goodbye, Mr. Feronde. Goodbye, Madame.
Au revoir.
- I'm having your things sent for.
- Good.
- Au revoir.
- Goodbye.
Charming fellow.
- How was the trip?
- It had its moments.
- Same old Arlington.
- What do you mean, old?
- Mr. Arlington, I presume.
- Yes.
- This is Henry Van Ness.
- This is my friend Tom Pierce.
How do you do?
Mr. Holt tells us you're going after a leopard.
Yes, and some rhino, too.
A bit of hunting, anyway.
- Van Ness and I got some leopard lately.
- We'll drop in and talk about it sometime.
- If you don't mind.
- No, not at all.
Tomorrow night.
You're not leaving before then?
We'll still be here. Come along, Martin.
Who are they?
They got wind of what we're after, and they wanted in with us.
Four white men might be better than two on this trip.
You don't know those fellows, Martin.
If four of us start out and we found the ivory, only two would get back... and they wouldn't be us.
- That kind?
- Exactly.
- What'd you tell them?
- I played dumb.
Said that you were wealthy and financing a hunting trip.
- Anyway, the wealthy part was true.
- Think so? I'm dead broke, Harry.
- So is the Bank of England.
- No, really. I'm stony.
I've staked my last penny on this pipe dream of yours.
- It had better be good.
- You're not serious!
I am. I've lost everything.
It's left me with an obsession to get it all back.
Anyhow, as long as I get it.
But when I do...
I'm going to sit on top of the pile with a gun and watch it grow.
Never thought I'd be in the same boat as you financially.
You had to go broke to get me there.
- Quite a place you have here.
- How do you do, sir?
- This is Beamish. He runs the store.
- How do you do?
- Welcome, Mr. Arlington.
- Thank you.
Come this way, sir.
I've fixed a nice bath for you.
I fancied you could use one.
Amazing foresight, Beamish.
I could use three baths.
Well, well!
- Fresh from the Folies Bergère?
- That's enough water.
A ceremonial dance.
Something to do with fertility.
- Personal or agricultural?
- Both, I think.
They'll be heading backcountry tomorrow.
Did you bring the dresses and things that I wrote for?
Everything. And a few extras.
I suppose you thought I was crazy.
So your lady turned you down for a sort of a wild man from Borneo?
It's a bit fantastic, isn't it?
A well-bred English girl living in the treetops...
- with a glorified native ape-man.
- Tarzan's as white as we are.
She's Parker's daughter.
She stayed behind when he died up there.
She's hit you pretty hard, hasn't she?
I'm in love with her, if that's what you mean.
- Where shall I put these things?
- Over by the table.
Go on over there. Put it down easy, now.
Come on, now.
I'm beginning to understand why you wanted Paris gowns.
Charm her back to civilization?
It's foolish, maybe... but I thought if she saw some of the latest dresses...
got the feel of silk, scent of perfume...
Women are funny about things like that, you know.
Might remind her.
She's been up there nearly a year now.
Look here, Harry...
I've got everything I have in this.
Did you drag me out to Africa to go after ivory or a woman?
Ivory.
- But if I can get the girl...
- Well, if that's the way...
I don't mind helping you kidnap your lady as long as we get the other first.
- I'll get it for you, sir. Just a moment.
- Thanks.
You know, if you have money, women aren't hard to get.
No harm intended, sir.
How much ivory is there really up there?
More than the largest safari can carry back.
Strange instinct that leads elephants to one spot to die.
- Fortunate one for us, though.
- I'm not complaining... if you're sure you can find the burial ground again.
I made a map of it on the way back.
14-day trek, you say?
With luck, to the foot of the Mutia Escarpment.
What's that?
The Mutia Escarpment, I mean.
It's a mountain barrier that divides the Africa we know...
from a country that no white man has ever seen and come back, except myself.
Natives hold it sacred.
- Taboo?
- Deadly.
It's the Juju of the Masai, the Wakabaranda... and all the tribes from the east to the west coast.
We came across a Zulu warrior once that had been killed by his tribe... because he tried to climb it.
What about our safari? How will they feel?
They're mostly village boys.
They'll be frightened.
But I got one safari across.
- How many did you get back?
- Myself.
Promises to be something more than a pleasure jaunt.
Yes, indeed.
Yes, Saidi.
Need safari boy, bwana. Make new pick.
What are you saying?
We have 50 first-class boys.
The chiefs have promised 200 more runners once you drum out the call.
- Fifty boy "mu/u,"bwana.
- Gone?
All boy gone make safari with Bwana Pierce and Bwana Van Ness.
- Pierce and Van Ness?
- What's the matter?
The map!
- Beamish!
- Coming, sir.
- They looked like slippery customers.
- That they were.
- Were Pierce and Van Ness in here again?
- Only for a moment, sir.
Saidi, send out the runners, drum up the tribes. Get 300 boys.
- How long ago did they leave?
- Sun here, bwana. Three, four hours.
- How soon can we get started, Harry?
- With equipment, six hours.
They'll have 10 hours' start.
Let's go without safari.
We'd be outnumbered and wouldn't have a chance.
Suppose we don't catch them.
What happens then?
I think I can find the barrier again.
But above that, Tarzan is our only hope.
- Come on, Saidi, keep them going.
- Yes, bwana.
- Saidi!
- Yes, bwana.
Give me a hand here. Here we go, boy.
Take him over here. Take that box.
Tell the boys to take a rest.
- What's the trouble?
- Bearers are done in.
I thought we'd better give them a breather here.
Tell those boys to keep the ammunition boxes out of the water.
Yes, bwana.
- How many men have we lost?
- Eight.
We figured 10 for the whole trek.
We didn't figure this pace.
Look at the condition they're in.
What is it?
They came across a white man's campfire a few hundred yards ahead.
A white man's campfire?
Pierce and Van Ness.
- He says it's still warm.
- Still warm?
- Come on, let's have a look.
- All right. Go ahead.
- My gun.
- No.
If they're close, they'll hear us.
Easy, Martin.
How old do you think it is?
Take cover!
- Pierce and Van Ness?
- Couldn't be anyone else.
- Notice the delayed sound?
- About 500 yards off, I'd say.
- Shall we have it out?
- We'd better not.
The base of the Escarpment's clearer.
Rather meet them there.
All right. You know the country better than I do.
- We'll parallel their trail.
- Right.
No use in walking into an ambush.
All right, boys, come on.
Saidi, get them on their feet, and we'll swing off a bit to the left.
Yes, bwana.
I don't like the sound of that chant.
I've hated it for days.
This is different.
They're frightened about something.
What's with them?
- What's the matter, Saidi?
- Mutia.
What?
It is the Mutia.
- It isn't any too soon to suit me.
- And a day ahead of schedule!
Juju, that's why they're frightened.
We can't lose time just because they're afraid.
- Come on, Saidi, get them going!
- Yes, bwana.
Boys, get on your feet.
There's nothing to be frightened of.
- What's the matter with him?
- He afraid of Mutia.
- Not go, bwana.
- Get into line.
- Drop that spear and get into line!
- No!
Anybody else that doesn't want to go?
- Saidi, take the lead. I'll stay back here.
- Yes, bwana.
- Whip would have done just as well.
- Perhaps you're right.
He could have carried 150 pounds of ivory.
- What's the matter, Saidi?
- Van Ness safari boy, bwana.
Gaboni kill.
- Gaboni?
- Yes, bwana.
Gaboni all time arrow here.
Couldn't be Gabonis.
They wouldn't leave the body here.
- Why not?
- They're cannibals.
First make kill. Bye, embark, come back.
The wound looks pretty fresh.
They can't be far away.
The map.
Pierce must have it.
I wonder if he got...
Is this it?
The part we don't need.
If they'd made the Mutia, no tribe would've followed them.
Sacred ground.
- What's that?
- Drum. Gaboni, bwana.
It's pretty close.
- We'd better make a run for it.
- Right.
Come on, Saidi, get them going!
- Make a stand?
- No, that's what Pierce and Van Ness did.
All right, come on!
Bwana, Mutia!
The Escarpment! Come on!
- Here they come.
- They'll never follow. The Mutia is sacred.
- He was on the Mutia!
- Lucky superstition for us.
We're out of range now.
What about a breather here?
We've got to make the top before dark.
Come on.
- Keep them going, Saidi.
- Yes, bwana.
- What's the trouble, Saidi?
- Too hard, bwana.
Let them stay where they are and pass the loads to the man ahead.
Yes, bwana.
- I hope we've got the worst behind us.
- We have.
Saidi, send the men for cover!
That's Tarzan! He's calling them off.
Come along.
No use in starting a riot, Martin.
Kill one, and we'll have to kill all.
Am I glad to see you!
You got here just in time.
That's it, Harry. I told you I'd come back.
- Come back?
- How's Jane?
Man.
Yes, Tarzan. This is Martin, my friend.
Martin my friend.
You don't know how glad I am to see you, old fellow.
Harry, Martin, my friend...
- Tarzan.
- That's right. But where is Jane?
Where is she? How is she?
How are you? Very well. Thank you.
- Has anything happened to her?
- Much man.
Yes, Tarzan, that's our safari. But...
There she is now.
Cheetah!
Cheetah baby.
Harry, I'm so glad you came.
Jane, I was so worried about you.
- When I saw Tarzan alone...
- You're not wounded?
- No.
- I was frightened.
- We came as fast as we could.
- You knew we were coming?
Tarzan heard there was a battle, and I thought it must be you.
- He was coming to help you.
- Martin my friend.
Jane, this is Martin Arlington, my partner.
I thought you were a myth, and I'm still not sure.
I think I can understand that.
I hope this means
I'm accepted in polite society.
- Yes, you're one of our set now.
- Did you think I was never coming back?
I knew you'd be back.
But, you know, it's been a year!
It's been a long year, too.
There were times
I thought we'd never make it.
- Tarzan will guide you the rest of the way.
- He will?
- I promised Harry.
- That's perfect.
Jane, I want to talk to you for hours.
But some of my men are hurt.
I should take care of them first.
- Is there any water here?
- Yes, there's a stream over there.
- He says he'll help you with your men.
- That's fine. Come along.
You know...
even if there wasn't any ivory,
I'd be glad I made the trek now.
You'll be much gladder when you see how much ivory there is.
Well, I can't say
I don't care about a fortune.
You're hurt.
- It's nothing, a Gaboni arrow.
- They're poisonous.
- Careful, Tarzan, it's hot.
- Hot?
Yes, it's coffee.
I don't think you'll like it, darling.
- Like it?
- You never drink anything hot?
- Never.
- Don't you miss it, Jane, things like this?
I must say, it is rather nice to have a cup of coffee for a change.
Yes, Tarzan.
- Where is he going?
- To build a house.
- Build a house?
- It doesn't take Tarzan long.
We have a mansion in every glade.
You can't spend the rest of your life camping out.
- Don't you ever want to come back?
- No, Harry.
Wouldn't it be nice to live where there's a lot of other men around?
Just to remind the number one boy that there's a number two?
And possibly a number three.
But on the other hand...
there are no other women here to make a fool of my number one boy.
- Yes, I've noticed the scarcity of women.
- That's not very flattering to me.
Meeting you is what made me conscious of it.
Like a hungry man outside a restaurant window.
- Don't you miss the fun you used to have?
- I have fun.
Those June nights in England,
Murray's Club at Maidenhead.
- Moonlight on the Thames?
- Dance.
A glass of champagne... sitting with real people and listening to the music.
Real people. I wonder.
Well, at least the men are civilized.
- Does that make them any better?
- For women.
Men never get a proper sense of values until they've been about a bit.
Look at Cheetah.
There's your civilization for you.
Come on, where's your vanity?
Wouldn't you like to get all dressed up again?
Not that I have any complaints on that score.
Why, I had this specially designed for me.
You haven't completely lost your interest in clothes?
- What woman ever does?
- No smart one.
Good. Come along.
Why, Harry? What is it?
- Harry's got a surprise for you.
- Surprise?
You wait and see.
They're lovely!
- I'm glad you like them.
- Like them?
Harry, they're gorgeous!
- You are a darling!
- Give me a little credit.
I shopped all over Paris to get them for you.
Look at this little thing.
It isn't much bigger than a postage stamp, is it?
But it's smart.
You look like the Jane Parker
I used to know.
Makes me feel like her.
- Not much good for climbing trees.
- Not much.
These are rather sheer, I think.
Give them to me.
There's no jungle flower with a perfume like this.
Eyebrow pencil, lipstick...
Indelible. Doesn't come off when you're kissed.
I brought all the allurements.
For two bachelors, you seem to know a great deal about what women wear.
I've done my share of shopping.
Lovely.
Well, now I'd better find a dress.
This one is the same color... as the one you wore that night at the dance at Mrs. Cutten's.
How sweet of you to remember.
The effect seems to be to promise to show something... that's never quite shown.
- It's lined.
- They're like that now.
- They are?
- Yes, London's gone leg-conscious.
I'm glad you haven't.
I like you just as you are.
How styles have changed, haven't they?
I wouldn't have believed it possible in such a short time.
I probably wouldn't know how to wear this anyway.
- Try it on.
- Yes, we'll clear out of your boudoir.
A gramophone?
Are we going to have music?
These records are four months old, but they'll probably be new to you.
I'm going to try these on.
But I want you to understand...
- it's not going to make any difference.
- Difference?
- You want me to go back.
- You must go back.
- Why?
- You can't stay here.
Supposing anything happened to him.
You couldn't live.
- I don't think I'd want to.
- That's nonsense.
- Suppose he were to die.
- Why should he?
Anything can happen in this place.
Where would you be then?
Where would he be if I went back?
We'll let him come along, too.
Tarzan over there? Then he would die.
- Come on. You're holding up the show.
- Right.
Run along. I won't be a minute. Go on.
She's priceless.
A woman who's learned the abandon of a savage... yet she'd be at home in Mayfair.
- She's not interested in Mayfair.
- Nonsense.
She's weakening already, you lucky pup.
- I don't think so.
- You'll get her back.
This is raw nature, old man.
Survival of fittest.
Up here, the fittest means Tarzan, and he wouldn't let her go.
If she wants to go how can he stop her?
Good heavens, Martin, he's...
He's not an animal.
- Please, bwana?
- Yes, Saidi.
Moko bad sick.
Needle bad.
All right. I'll give him a hypo.
Where is he, Saidi?
Get out of there! Come on!
- What was that?
- Safari boys, curious about the music.
I love it.
Need any help?
- Do you always help ladies to dress?
- When they're lovely enough.
Voilà.
How's that?
Perfect. And I thought improvement impossible.
You see? Woman's greatest weapon is man's imagination.
Very becoming, too.
- Where's Harry?
- Sick native.
He'll be away for a few minutes, I hope.
Thank you.
Funny, isn't it?
You're the first woman
I ever had to coax into an evening gown.
I imagine that isn't your usual practice.
Well, everything seems to go by opposites here.
- I believe I have this dance, Lady Jane.
- Oh, yes.
I really promised this dance to the Duke of Riverbotham... but as the old fogy isn't here, we'll let him wait.
Thank you.
You know, you're a fascinating little savage.
Forgive me, please. I forgot myself.
You're so lovely.
- I blame myself as much as you.
- Please don't.
We'll forget about it... if you'll remember that there's only one man that means anything to me.
And that's Tarzan.
- There's nothing in there. That's music.
- Music?
Music, like the natives make on their tom-toms.
This is a little bit more civilized. Look.
That's right.
You'll be the talk of the town.
It's thrilling, isn't it?
Music still hath charms to soothe the savage... but I know a greater fascination.
Yes, the jungle does grow on one, doesn't it?
Only very lately on me.
Don't forget, Martin, there are dangers in the jungle, too.
Adds to the fascination.
These are clothes.
Women wear them because they hope men will like them.
That's why I wore these, Tarzan.
I thought you'd like them.
- Like them?
- Those are stockings.
Like them.
Something provocative about the feel of silk.
Always was.
Same curiosity he had about the phonograph.
It's perfume.
I think Tarzan approves.
- No go.
- No, Tarzan.
- Harry, can't you and I have a dance?
- Most assuredly.
No go.
Harry, perhaps it is getting a little late.
I'm sorry.
You're a bad boy.
Good morning. I love you.
You never forget, do you, Tarzan?
- Never forget I love you.
- Love who?
- Love you.
- Love who?
Love Jane.
Love my...
My wife.
Go on now, lazybones.
Go on and get my fruit juice.
So you've been out shopping early?
Or did you spend the night at the club?
Now, you can't get around me like that.
Are you sure there isn't another woman?
Woman. Man.
That's the way it should be, Tarzan.
I love you. Happy.
And Harry wants to send you to London... get you all dressed up in tight shoes and an old high collar.
If you wanted to see a tree, you'd have get a little watering can...
and sprinkle it to make it grow.
- Then you'd be unhappy.
- Unhappy?
That's a word, Tarzan, I hope you're never going to know the meaning of.
What?
- Swim.
- All right.
Just a minute.
Now, you mustn't grumble, dear.
Swim.
You don't know how lucky you are compared to other husbands.
The poor things have to wait hours every morning...
- for their wives to get dressed.
- Swim.
Darling, I have to put on clothes.
There are other people here and they'd think I was immodest.
I love you.
Good morning, early bird.
Did you get your worm this morning?
That's fine.
Cheetah certainly deserts us when we get near water, doesn't she?
Wait, Tarzan!
Darling, you're very...
Throw that down to me, Cheetah.
Give that to me.
Cheetah, that isn't funny.
Throw it down to me, Cheetah.
Can't you see I've got nothing on.
Give it to me.
That's a good monkey.
Darling, come here.
They're not bad ones, anyway.
- Jane, are you all right?
- Of course.
Why wouldn't I be?
Hello, Harry.
- What is it, Martin?
- Sure we're going right?
Tarzan said a perfectly straight line.
There must be an easier way.
This is like trying to shovel quicksand.
What's the use of a guide if you don't follow him?
I might, if he'd quit yodeling and help us out.
- Saidi, have we been going straight?
- Yes, bwana.
I'm going to try a detour.
Cut off to the left where it's not so thick.
Afraid we'll lose our direction.
Anything's better than this continued hacking.
Come on, swing over, you blighters.
Martin my friend.
While there's clothes, there's hope with a woman.
You're off the track.
We'll be hours cutting our way through in a straight line.
Tarzan has taken care of that.
That's all right, Harry.
Tarzan's called the elephant to clear a trail for you.
That's fine. Thanks.
Down, Cheetah.
Cheetah will let us know if you have any trouble.
You should reach a clearing when the sun is at the treetops.
About an hour.
That's an excellent idea.
Cheerio.
Going through the jungle is play for them.
Stop it!
They're just playing?
I wonder what they do for exercise.
No, Tarzan! Don't!
That's no way to treat a lady.
- Fun is fun, but...
- Fun.
Stop it!
Wait till I get my breath.
You're going to carry me from now on.
Now, that wasn't fair.
If you do that again,
I'll never speak to you anymore.
How much further is it?
I'm glad that's over.
Jane learn. Jane learn Tarzan.
Tarzan learn Jane.
Well, I must have graduated today.
Graduated.
They can make camp here.
And I want a nice house with a river view.
It's good to rest here.
Thank you, darling.
Now, lazy, get up. You've got work to do.
Go on and see what's happened to the safari.
Good Cheetah.
Cheetah, look out!
I'm all right, dear, but Cheetah...
Good Cheetah.
Hello!
A rhino do that?
She got in front of it to save me.
She's gone, Little Cheetah.
And there's nothing you can do, nor I, nor anybody.
There, there, Cheetah.
The hurt will die down.
It has to.
Otherwise none of us could stand life.
Come back!
Tarzan doesn't want you to go there.
I'm only shaken up.
But you, are you all right?
Very well, thank you.
Tarzan, no.
We have to get the safari started.
Come on.
Good morning.
We've been up for hours.
- Would you like some coffee?
- No, thank you.
Jane, tell me.
Could Tarzan really call more elephants?
- A whole herd?
- He won't believe me.
- Yes. Why?
- We can use them as a pack train.
Carry tons more ivory away.
Of course. Why, that's a grand idea!
I don't know why I didn't think of it.
Tarzan, we want you to get more elephants.
No, dear. All the elephants. Every one.
Yes, dear. They need the elephants to get the ivory, the tusks.
They load it on the elephants and take it back with them.
- Back?
- Yes.
Mahowoni sleep.
That's why they're going to the burial ground. To get the ivory.
It will make them rich.
It's no good to us just lying there.
Mahowoni sleep.
I promised them, Tarzan.
Mahowoni sleep.
What does he think we wanted to go there for?
I hadn't thought.
You see, Tarzan has no objectives.
He just goes somewhere because he wants to.
- And then my father's buried there.
- He went with us before.
- You didn't try to take away any ivory.
- Can't you persuade him?
I'll try, Harry.
Are you sure you don't know the way yourself?
No, not without him.
Did he guide you before?
- No, we followed a dying elephant.
- A dying elephant?
Yes, I told you about that.
It's elephant's instinct.
If they feel death coming on, they head for the burial grounds.
- Dying elephant.
- What did he say?
He'll take you back, but he won't go on.
But he's got to understand.
Every penny we've got in the world is tied up in this.
Tarzan knows nothing about money.
That wouldn't mean anything to him.
What's the harm? They're all dead.
It's as though somebody asked you to rob a graveyard back home.
But these are animals.
They're not humans. This is different.
Not to him. I know how you feel...
but I think I know how he feels, too.
You're going to let him stop you from keeping your promise?
I had no right to promise for him.
Tarzan is the only law here:
The jungle's and mine.
Won't you let us guide you back?
I'm going on. I've got too much at stake.
- I'm sorry, Harry.
- But didn't he understand...
If I can't have one guide, I'll have another.
Martin, wait! Hold up!
Stop it! Don't, Tarzan!
Put him down.
- Bad Martin my friend.
- You just don't understand, darling.
Tarzan, wait.
- Harry, we're leaving.
- You won't come back with us?
I belong with him. Goodbye.
I'm here for ivory. What about you?
I'm with you.
- All right, Saidi. We'll follow its trail.
- Yes, bwana.
Where's she heading for now?
Straight through the waterfalls.
That's the way we went before.
- Through them?
- Yes.
All right, Saidi.
I was afraid she wouldn't last long enough to get here.
They always do somehow.
God, it's like a city paved with gold!
Let's pack out as soon as we can.
Next trip, we'll bring 1,000 men.
Let's get started.
There's something about this place that seems to get me.
- Elephants' ghosts?
- No.
Jane's father is buried over there.
- Saidi.
- Yes, bwana.
Load up the tusks. We'll pack right out.
Everyone carries ivory, even the spearmen, understand?
- No exceptions.
- Yes, bwana.
What are these boys doing with boxes?
Boys carry food. Eat, bwana.
Come on, boys.
What are you doing with that shield and spear, boy?
Everybody carries ivory.
We don't need any spearmen. Come on.
We'll be trampled to death.
- Dead men can't give orders.
- Yes, they can.
Tarzan, wait!
Tarzan, I've got to talk to them first.
You must wait.
- Wait?
- You must.
Won't you give up this idea?
You're my people.
I don't want to see you buried here with my father.
- Perhaps, after all, we are wrong.
- What?
The elephants are Tarzan's friends.
I realize we're violating something he holds sacred.
That's generous of you.
- Tarzan will guide us back now, won't he?
- Yes.
They won't take the ivory.
They understand.
Yes, of course.
Perhaps we can stay here for tonight.
The boys are dog-tired...
- and there's no hurry now.
- Of course.
I suppose it's safe enough with these elephants here... but the boys will be uneasy.
Tarzan will send them back.
Tomorrow, when the sun is there, we'll start back.
- Saidi, have the boys start a fire.
- Yes, bwana.
Lantern, Saidi. Thank you.
Her father's grave.
This was my father's.
I want you to wear it always.
Always.
Good morning. I love you.
Always.
Yes, darling, always.
Hurry back to me, Tarzan.
Back?
Not a trace. We've beaten every inch of the riverbank for miles.
He can't be gone.
Jane, you must face facts.
They're cruel, but you must.
Why, he's fought a hundred crocodiles.
He didn't see it. I shouted.
He turned, but there was nothing he could do.
- He might have got away.
- Jane, you've got to look after yourself.
- Did you find any...
- Sorry.
But there must be some traces.
Even if he were...
He said, "Always."
Wait.
Take me away.
- You're dead-tired, aren't you, Jane?
- I'm all right.
We could make a litter and have some of the boys carry you.
The walking helps.
You're very brave.
No. If I were, I should be back there.
With Tarzan's memory.
Answer me honestly, Jane.
Would you feel better if we didn't take the ivory?
If we carried it back?
Martin, that's sweet of you... but nothing matters anymore.
Supposing she had said, "Take it back."
Strange about that croc.
I never would have believed that Tarzan could have been caught off guard... if you hadn't told me.
I thought you'd gone.
Well, she didn't desert you after all.
- In the jungle, fidelity goes to the living.
- Everywhere.
There, there, Cheetah. That's all right.
You can go with me.
What is it?
Better tie a rope on her so she won't run off again.
What is it, Cheetah?
She's trying to tell me something.
Perhaps you should leave her here in freedom.
They die in captivity.
Tarzan's alive.
What?
He's alive.
Tarzan's alive.
- I wish he were, but...
- But he is.
- She wants to take me to him.
- It's impossible.
- Do you believe this, Jane?
- I know it.
- Harry, I've got to go to him.
- Then we'll go with you.
Saidi, halt them.
Jane, you're chasing a shadow.
- He's alive, somewhere.
- We'll follow Cheetah.
Juju drums.
Where?
Behind and over there.
- Juju, bwana.
- What tribe?
New country, bwana. No tell.
All right. Get them started.
Straight ahead.
But Harry, we've got to get through to Tarzan. That way.
It's blocked. We'll save ourselves first.
Cheetah can show us the way after.
Come back here, you!
Pick up that ivory. Pick it up.
- Ivory doesn't count now.
- I'm holding on.
If we could get to those rocks, we could hold them off.
We might rush them.
The moment we raise a gun, they'll be on us.
They've never seen a gun.
We can get past.
All right, we'll try it.
Saidi, tell the boys to bring the ammunition boxes up.
Saidi, pass the word that when we fire, everyone runs for the rocks.
Ready, Martin?
Now!
Get the ammunition box.
I wish we had that box of ammunition.
- Cover me.
- Wait a minute.
- You're a better shot than I am.
- Yes, I know.
I'm a faster runner, too.
Don't waste your ammunition.
We can't kill them all.
Cheetah, come back!
Deserting us?
No, she isn't. She's going to get Tarzan.
Go on, Cheetah!
She'll make it.
Cheetah, go on!
I know who they are.
Tarzan calls them
"the men that eat lions."
Eat lions?
They roar to call the lions, then they spear them.
This time they're going to let the lions do the hunting.
They're staking Saidi out.
- Come back, you can't save him.
- Harry, come back!
Stand guard on the ledge.
I've always thought when you were faced with death, nothing would matter.
What does?
You.
Always gone.
No, dear. Always is just beginning for you and me.
Old guard, present arms!
New guard...
Halt!
New guard...
Left...
Turn!
New guard...
Slow... march!
New guard... halt!
New guard... present... arms!
Old guard... shoulder... arms!
New guard... shoulder... arms!
Old guard... order... arms!
New guard... stand at...
Ease!
Look! The Prince!
Fine body of men, the guards...
And no soldier in the world like them.
By gad, you're right, sir!
Beer and beef, that's the stuff that makes soldiers.
Besides, it gives a man... a figure
Have you seen today's "Times" sir?
No William.
- The news from Paris.
- Yes.
Over 50 people guillotined in one day.
Damnable, useless cruelty.
Well, what can you expect from foreigners with no sporting instinct?
Gad, if it wasn't for our fox hunting and our pheasant shooting...
I dare say we should be cruel too.
Let's hope the scarlet Pimpernel will save some of the rest.
- Do you know who he is, sir?
- No.
But I confess, I feel a little prouder...
When I remember that he is an Englishman.
Whoever he is...
He'll have his work cut out in Paris.
Did you read this, sir?
There they go again.
It's always the same.
The drums roll, the knife falls...
And another aristocrat parts company with his head.
Very monotonous.
And so clumsy, that great ugly machine.
When all they need is a sharper razor.
A quick wrist and flick!
Here, steady!
Ho-ho, you're all right, partner.
I wish they'd give me a few aristocrats to shave.
Eh, Jacques?
Then we should see some sport.
And you would!
When you see me dealing with the Scarlet Pimpernel.
- The what?
- The Scarlet Pimpernel!
Haven't you heard?
There's a band of Englishmen helping these cursed aristos out of the country.
Their chief is the only man who ever cheated Madame Guillotine.
He's known by the title of the Scarlet Pimpernel.
Who is he?
Oh... that's the mystery.
So you're a farmer from Nordesque, are you?
Yes, sir.
You thought you could fool me with a disguise like that!
Well, I'll keep this wig of yours...
Because after tomorrow you won't have a head to put it on!
And I shall be delighted to visit Madame Guillotine...
And make the acquaintance of the only decent person left in France.
Captain, I say "Death to the Republic... and long live the King!"
Take him away!
Stupid fool!
That makes the third aristocrat
I've caught this week.
I can smell 'em through any disguise.
Thank heaven for the game of chess.
It enables us to forget the more disagreeable realities of life.
I'm not so sure it is a good thing.
We've been too detached from reality all our lives.
That's what caused the revolution.
- Possibly.
- Undoubtedly!
If we'd only had eyes to see our own follies, we shouldn't be here now...
Waiting to be shaved...
By the national razor.
Which is the Count de Tournay?
I am the Count de Tournay's daughter.
My father is over there playing the chess.
This is my mother.
The Count de Tournay?
If you will look at the passage
I have marked...
Your spirits will be uplifted.
We are not afraid to die, Father.
Even so, it is sometimes better to live.
- How many, Captain?
- Sixty-four.
Robespierre gives Madame Guillotine extra fodder today.
The former Duc de Tours.
The former Abbé de Saint Preux.
The former Count and Countess de Larnai.
The former Madame de Nijon.
The former Count d'Eterais.
The former Marquis de Jouvence and family.
The former Marquis de Robeaupier.
The two Countesses Herret.
The former Mademoiselle de Bournard.
The two former Duchesses
Passy and Boniveaux.
The former Marquis de Marais.
The former Count de Tournay and family.
The former Countess de Cherainville.
The former Madame de Piccard.
Come.
The former Count d'Arblai.
- Are you de Tournay?
- I am.
You are remanded.
Citizen Robespierre wants to see you.
- Thank God!
- The rest of you, get on!
Take him inside!
Come on!
Come on!
Get out of the way!
Get out!
You must have courage, Suzanne.
Remember...
The Scarlet Pimpernel is waiting to save us.
He's never failed to keep his promise.
But it's too late!
Long live the King of France!
Long live the King of France!
Look at me whip, me hearties.
Look at it!
Three and twenty locks of hair in it.
There they are...
There's...
There's the Duc de Rouilly.
There's his handsome wife, the Duchess.
And here's the hair of her lover...
- The handsome...
- Where's your passport, hag?
He takes me for an aristocrat.
Well, you're right, Captain.
Can't be too careful, can you?
No, you can't be too...
Here, here's me passport.
This says
"Citizeness Renard and grandson."
Where's the grandson?
He's in the cart, poor darling.
Yes? What's the matter with him?
He's got the plague.
- The horrible black plague.
- Plague?
Yes.
I don't think I shall get him alive as far as Chambois.
Give me... give me a light from your pipe, will you Captain?
Keep away from me with your plague!
Get out of here, quick!
And when you come back, try to pass another gate.
For you won't pass through this one again!
You are right, Captain.
You are right.
But I'll be back... somehow.
- Who's in charge here?
- I am.
An old hag of a woman will pass this way in a cart.
You are to stop her, and arrest her.
Did you say an old hag?
You heard me.
But, but she passed through here some time ago.
- Her passport was...
- You miserable fool!
You blundering idiot!
Did you search the cart?
No, no, I... her grandson was inside with the plague.
- Would you expect me to expose...
- You were expected to use your brains!
Now I see you haven't any!
That sick grandson was really three aristocrats snatched from the guillotine!
Ten thousand hells!
And the old hag, who was she?
The old hag, my clever Captain...
Was that cursed Englishman, the Scarlet Pimpernel.
- Forward, we'll catch him this time!
- Open the gates!
What's that?
What?
Sounds like a troop of horsemen.
We're being pursued!
Don't be frightened, Ladies.
You are among friends.
- But this soldiers?
- My friends, Mademoiselle, and yours.
Are you the Scarlet Pimpernel?
I am only a humble instrument in the hands of our great leader.
- How many are you?
- Twenty, madam.
One to command, nineteen to obey.
- Shall we see your leader?
- I'm sorry, I must ask you to hurry.
- Where's de Tournay?
- Taken back into prison.
- Why?
- We don't know.
So we have to come back and take him.
- How are things at Calais?
- Lawson's there.
- And Ashurst?
- He hadn't arrived when we left.
Oh hadn't he?
His time sense is defective... that's twice.
They may have arrested him.
They're very careful at the
Channel ports nowadays.
My order to you is that you're not to be arrested.
And I expect my orders to be obeyed.
Yes Percy.
You, Wilmot and Grant go back to Paris.
My brother-in-law will follow you there.
All three of you will get your next instructions from Quentin.
Well, goodbye.
And remember... don't get caught.
- Right.
- Right.
- Good luck!
- Goodbye.
Go!
Giddap!
Well...
Why did they keep de Tournay back?
Because Robespierre wanted to see him.
And Robespierre wants to see him because the Ambassador of the Republic, has come over from London.
Chauvelin?
Why?
All in your honor, Percy.
Your work is becoming even more dangerous than it was.
Our work, Armand.
You go back to Paris at once.
Find out everything you can about Chauvelin
If he goes to London, you go too.
Our most dangerous enemy...
Is citizen Chauvelin.
Citizen Chauvelin.
Citizen Chauvelin!
My dear Chauvelin, I'm very sorry that I have to ask you to undertake the journey to London.
But this matter of the Scarlet Pimpernel has become a national menace.
How can you expect me to detect him in a country that hates us like the devil and puts every obstacle in my way?
We expect you to overcome obstacles like our generals in the field.
They know that to lose the battle means the guillotine.
Have you any plans?
Naturally.
We may assume that the Scarlet Pimpernel and his gang... speaks perfect French.
They belong therefore to a class that has been brought up by French nurses and French tutors.
So far not bad.
I have a list of all the likely names.
I have them watched day and night.
Sooner or later, I'll draw the net.
You think de Tournay might be useful?
Possibly.
De Tournay, the former Count de Tournay
Former Ambassador to the former King of France in London.
Citizen Chauvelin
Ambassador of the French Republic in London.
De Tournay,
I want to make you an offer.
We offer you your life.
All we ask in return... is that you merely get in touch with your many English friends... and soon you will be able to tell us who is the man known as the Scarlet Pimpernel.
You want me to be a spy?
You have been too long in politics not to be a realist.
A little piece of information... we give you your life.
God gave me my life...
He will take it away as soon as it pleases Him.
And now my family has gone to the guillotine...
My one wish is to follow.
Would it alter your outlook to hear that your family is alive?
Don't trifle with me.
I sent them to the guillotine for the future happiness of the human race...
But I do not allow torture.
Where are they?
I saw them being dragged towards the tumbrel.
On their way to the guillotine the band of the Scarlet Pimpernel snatched them away.
Where are they?
Probably in England by this time.
To His Majesty King George III.
God bless him for his hospitality to us poor exiles.
To King Louis of France...
May God protect him.
And to your husband, madam.
I hope the Scarlet Pimpernel and you gentlemen will rescue him, as you did us.
The Scarlet Pimpernel...
What a droll name...
What does it mean?
It is a humble wayside flower, mademoiselle.
And it hides the identity of the best and bravest man in all the world.
Do you know, Sir Andrew, my best friend in London
Marguerite St. Just?
Suzanne, how often am I to tell you
I will not have that woman's name mentioned in my presence.
But mother, you can't believe that dreadful story.
- What story?
- It's the truth.
Marguerite St. Just...
Denounced the Marquis de St. Cyr and his family to the tribunal.
They all went to the guillotine.
- Marguerite St. Just?
- Yes.
She married an Englishman.
Do you know her?
Know her?
Everybody in London knows Lady Blakeney.
Lady Blakeney, have you something in your mouth?
Not now, Mr. Romney.
I can't do justice to that lovely face when it's all bulged out with bonbon.
You may talk if you like, but no bonbon!
And no gestures, please!
All right, Mr. Romney.
I'll tell you what it is about the Pimpernel that tantalizes me so.
It is his insufferable modesty.
There's no excuse for it!
It's maddening to think that somewhere there's a man as marvelous as that.
And we never see him!
He is of no use to us whatever!
Lady Blakeney, I said no gestures, please!
Oh, you must remember that
I am a French woman... and when I talk I must use these as well as this.
The de Tournay family arrived in Dover today.
All except the father.
We have to go back for him.
It's going to be devilish awkward after what's happened.
Well I'll go.
So will Hastings if you'll let us.
We will all go if it comes to that.
But even so, we're only 20.
Yesterday, 30 people went to the guillotine.
Are you trying to suggest that there aren't enough of us?
Perhaps that there isn't a decent Englishman that wouldn't be proud to join us.
We could be 500, a thousand within a week.
And within another week everyone of us would be a marked man.
We shouldn't be able to rescue a single soul.
Mere force is useless against people who are neither cowards nor fools.
We must match courage with courage... and cunning with still greater cunning if we're going to do anything at all.
We are all willing to give our lives.
But we must do more than that.
We must mask our identities...
Suffer the humiliation of being taken for fops, fools, nitwits... cowards
So many people die every day that could be saved.
You think I don't feel that?
You think I like sitting there in the shadow of the knife... while one head falls after another?
People I know and love.
Innocent people... kindly people...
Herded like sheep... butchered like cattle... by men who make high-sounding principles and excuses for the most bestial cruelty.
Robespierre's liberty, his equality...
Well... sink me, if it isn't
Colonel Ramsbottom.
Well. how are you Ramsbottom?
Winterbottom, Sir!
Ramsbottom... what a ridiculous mistake...
Allow me to explain, Colonel...
Here's that ass, Blakeney!
I'm off!
Odd's blood, this club wants cheering up.
Sink me, the place is a mausoleum.
Are you being offensive, Sir?
Who Sir? Me, sir?
No, sir!
Stab me. I'm bubbling over with good humor this morning.
Would you believe me,
I've just written a masterpiece?
- Who, sir? You, sir?
- Me, sir!
- No, sir!
- Yes, sir!
All about this mysterious
Pimpernel fellow.
How it came to me, heaven only knows because it was the busiest moment of the day...
Darn, I was tying my cravat.
Oh well, here it is.
"The Scarlet Pimpernel" by Sir Percival Blakeney,
Baronet.
- What?
- Well, that's the title.
"They seek him here,
"they seek him there.
"Those Frenchies seek him everywhere.
"Is he in heaven?
"Is he in hell?
That damned, elusive Pimpernel."
What?
Hmm, not bad!
Not bad?
It's damned good!
I'll write it out, then you can all learn it.
Yes...
Well...
Good day, gentlemen.
Goodbye. Higgenbottom.
Winterbottom, curse you!
I beg your pardon?
Didn't I say Winterbottom?
Bunch of young jackanapes!
They're all alike, this fashionable puppies.
Insufferable!
What that young man needs...
Is a year or two of hard campaigning.
Facing powder... and shot... undergoing privation.
I can't imagine Blakeney running into much danger.
Not he!
He doesn't belong to our vintage.
It's not my fault!
It's a matter of infinitely small importance to me... whose fault it is.
The man who could put starch in my jabot...
Is equally capable of putting poison in my coffee.
There, you see?
I'm a laughingstock, and rightly so.
Look at the cursed thing.
Sticking out like a barber's pole.
Sink me, the thing is a disaster.
Go away, Brinker, you dreadful fellow.
Ladies...
Your servant.
Marguerite... your slave.
Ah, Romney.
How are you?
And how is the portrait progressing?
The eyes are wrong, aren't they?
And is the nose all right?
You know...
I rather think you missed the mouth... altogether.
Yes, you have.
Otherwise, it's the image of her.
I think that will be enough for today.
Poor Mr. Romney.
You are tired, and so am I.
Tired?
Zounds, me too.
You know, dear lady...
I've just been to Bath to be cured of the fatigue.
And now I'm so fatigued by the cure that I...
I really think that I shall have to go to Bath again... to be cured of the fatigue.
It has been a charming party.
- Goodbye!
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye!
Bye, Lady Blakeney, thank you.
Bye, Sir Percy...
Goodbye, Sir Percy...
Goodbye, Sir Percy!
Goodbye, Goodbye...
Goodbye...
What do you think of it?
It's clever...
But there's something lacking.
What?
I don't know.
There's a look...
A look in the eyes...
He's lost it.
Perhaps, I've lost it.
Perhaps it was happiness.
Good gad, my dear!
How you could be unhappy.
I can't imagine.
Can't you?
Percy...
Can't you?
Oh, cursed if I can.
Why, you're the most courted woman in town.
- By whom?
- By everybody.
Except you!
Dear me, my dear,
I'm your husband.
Months after we were married, we were still happy...
And then came this...
Estrangement.
Which Heaven knows, is none of my making.
Can you honestly say that?
Can you honestly deny that you've changed?
So changed...
That I scarcely know you.
You're never with me now.
You're always away on some pretext or other.
I'm always alone.
Then I've mighty good news for you, my dear.
Your brother's arriving from Paris.
- Armand?
- Yes.
When?
At any moment.
And then you won't be alone, will you?
When am I going to see you again?
Whenever you wish to.
Well then, every day.
Suzanne!
Where's the chief?
He went to town yesterday as soon as he arrived here.
- Any order for us?
- Yes...
We have to wait here till tonight for a message from Armand St. Just.
Right.
- Did you follow them?
- Yes.
A sailor gave a letter to Sir Andrew Ffoulkes.
Did you get it?
It wasn't easy, but...
We had six men there.
Where are they now?
Gagged and bound on the ship.
And the letter?
You will release them tomorrow.
Watch every move they make.
Maurier...
Go over to France at once.
The moment St. Just returns, arrest him.
Armand St. Just.
Marguerite St. Just...
The famous actress...
She will give a great performance by Republican command...
For her brother's sake.
Percy, I don't want Armand to go back to France.
If you'll help me we can keep him in England.
He'll settle down here, marry a nice girl...
And have lovely children.
What a dreadful prospect.
What has poor Armand done to be sentenced to matrimony?
You should know better, my dear.
You're unhappy... Why?
Armand, I have the satisfaction of knowing that the biggest fool in England has the most complete contempt for his wife.
Percy?
How did it happen?
I don't know.
I only know that when I married him he was a man.
He was my lover.
I was glad to give up everything for him.
And now...
You mustn't leave me, Armand!
I need you...
I'm all alone.
I can't stay.
You're going back to France?
But it's not safe!
For me?
I'm no aristocrat.
For anyone under the terror.
I shall look after the Blakeney estate in France.
Oh, Percy is so rich!
What does it mean to him?
He is not even interested in his English estates.
Since the terror he wouldn't go over to France for all the treasures in the world.
Why should you risk your life for his money?
Oh, I don't risk my life.
Don't worry, darling.
Percy?
May I ask you something?
What's happened to you and Marguerite?
Marriage, I suppose.
Why?
You loved her once... I know.
Do you remember the first family to go to the guillotine?
The St. Cyrs.
They told me it was Marguerite who denounced them.
It was a lie!
I wish I could believe that.
Did you ask her?
I did.
She flashed back a "yes" as sharp as the knife of the guillotine.
I watched that execution.
The Marquis...
His wife...
His son.
And it was my wife...
Who put them there.
So that's why you ceased to love her.
What a tragedy.
Ceased?
I shall love her till I die.
That's the tragedy.
And it's to make up what she did to them...
That you risk your own life week after week to rescue the others?
Don't be so heroic, Armand.
I got a smack in the eye, and I took refuge in sport.
And what a sport!
By gad,
I think I shall give up fox hunting this winter.
Now, what do you think of it?
Monstrous fine, sir!
Vastly becoming.
Now, there's a coat you could wear with comfort.
You know perfectly well
I can wear nothing with comfort...
Until Sir Percy says so.
Where is that jackanapes?
Who. sir?
You, sir!
Here, sir!
And now, tell Treadle what...
What's wrong with this coat.
The back is admirable.
The front's fair.
The collar is. uh, possible.
But the sleeve. Treadle.
The cuff, my poor, benighted friend...
That, Sir Percy, is the last words in cuffs!
Oh, gad, I should hope so for there should never be another like it!
Oh, come now, it's...
It's not too bad.
You see, Sir Percy,
His Royal Highness approves.
My poor Treadle, His Royal Highness does nothing of the kind.
He says it's "not so bad".
And nothing in the world is "so bad"...
As something which is "not so bad".
- But Sir Percy...
- It's a crime, Treadle.
Worse, a blunder.
And quite, quite fatal to my reputation.
Why to your reputation?
Because all the world knows that His Royal Highness is guided by my taste.
Yes, yes, yes...
Percy is an expert on coats.
And britches, sir!
I'm a very wonder with the inexpressibles.
Isn't that so, Treadle?
Well, yes, up to a point.
Zounds, Treadle... Why must you be so cursed jealous?
Look at that puny sleeve...
That miserable dishrag of lace.
Odd's fish!
Looks like the lining hanging down.
It was only intended for a plain cut.
Plain! it's as ugly as a parson's widow.
Open up your sleeves, man.
Let your ruffles take the air.
Let them flow, let them ripple.
So that when His Royal Highness takes snuff...
It'll be a swallows flight.
That's it!
Why, Timmy Percy...
You're brainless, spineless, useless
But you do know clothes.
Odd's fish! That...
That’s something, isn't it, sir?
- Treadle! Treadle!
Yes, Your Highness!
Don't forget what Sir Percy says about about the sleeves.
- A swallow's flight!
- Yes, Your Highness!
Flight of, uh, a swallow.
Come along, come along, gentlemen.
Oh, by the way, Wilmot...
Chauvelin's arrived in London.
Have him watched.
I'm just off to the fight with the Prince.
- Report to me there.
- Very good.
Mendoza's groggy!
He... He's done!
Don't you believe it, sir.
He's foxing!
You wait until the 30th round.
I'll wager 100 guineas he won't last two more rounds.
- Done!
- Come on, Mendoza!
Come on Jackson!
- You'd better hedge, Percy!
- Hedge be damned, I'll double.
- Done!
- Percy must be mad!
Mendoza's finished!
Get up, Mendoza!
Where is he?
- Where is he?
- He's at you house.
No, I will not!
You tricked me once into giving you information about the Marquis de St. Cyr.
I shall never forgive myself.
I'm sick of this sentimental twaddle about the poor persecuted aristocrats.
Have you forgotten what they did to the defenseless peasantry for centuries?
What this very St. Cyr did to you?
No, I have not.
But I'm no spy.
- That is your last word?
- Absolutely!
I wonder....
Oh, by the way, how's your brother, Armand?
Very well, I hope.
I hope so too.
But yesterday he was arrested...
Arrested?
At Boulogne.
What for?
As a traitor to his country.
Traitor?
You're lying, Chauvelin.
You're trying to trick me again.
I've the proof of his guilt in my pocket.
This scrap of paper will certainly send your brother to the guillotine.
Unless, of course, you care to redeem it.
Bring me the name of the Pimpernel and it is yours.
But even if I wanted to...
- I don't know it!
- Find it!
How can I if you can't with an army of spies?
Because you go everywhere and know everyone in his circle.
That much I do know.
And this also...
That he will be among the guests tomorrow night at the Grenville ball.
So will half the world!
This thing is impossible!
You're a clever woman whose brother's life is at stake...
Nothing is impossible.
Well?
No, Chauvelin...
I won't!
Very well, madam.
Chauvelin!
Madam?
Do you swear to give me that paper?
The moment I catch the Scarlet Pimpernel.
Zounds!
That name again?
I've heard nothing else all day.
At the club. the fight, and now here.
I protest, the fellow is a public nuisance.
I beg your pardon, my dear.
Do I intrude?
No, no.
This is an old, uh, acquaintance.
Monsieur Chauvelin, the French Ambassador.
My husband.
Charmed, delighted, enchanted.
Devilish clever race, the French.
How they speak that unspeakable language of theirs defeats me.
You flatter us, Sir Percy.
No, no, you've got the cleverest heads in the world.
The only trouble is...
You all go to pieces around the neck.
Around the neck?
Yes, now look at that thing.
Sink me, what a mess!
Now, if you'd really like to know how to tie a cravat...
I'll tell you.
But it isn't easy, mind, it would take all my brains.
I'm sure it would.
Yes, now look here.
Well, you see, first of all the thing goes twice around the neck.
And then the front folds back to allow the back to come to the front.
Otherwise the front would be all behind as well as before.
Percy, what are you talking about?
You don't follow me, my dear?
That's exactly what I say.
It takes brains, doesn't it?
- One can see that.
- Yes, of course.
Good day, Lady Blakeney.
Oh, no, no, don't go.
You and my wife must have so much to say to each other.
We have.
But then I promised myself a little tête-á-tête with Lady Blakeney at Lord Grenville's ball tomorrow night.
Good.
Tomorrow night, then.
But before you go...
You must hear my verse about that cursed Pimpernel fellow.
You'll love it!
Listen.
"They seek him here...
"they seek him there...
"Those Frenchies seek him everywhere.
"Is he in heaven?
"Is he in hell?
That damned elusive Pimpernel".
- Delightful!
- What?
Especially that, uh... that line:
"Those Frenchies seek him everywhere".
Yes, I like that too.
Because, you see
I hear that they do.
And that gives the line a sort of something...
That sort of gives it, ah...
A something, uh...
If I make myself clear.
Clear as crystal.
Good day, my dear Sir Percy.
Bonjour, "misu", as the French say.
Bonjour!
Magnificent fight this afternoon, my dear.
Gad, that fellow Mendoza's got quick ears.
In the 10th round, when Jackson had him down
I shouted, "Get up Mendoza!"
And damn me, he did.
And, sink me, he won.
Do you think...
Andrew Ffoulkes might be the Scarlet Pimpernel?
Andrew?
Never!
He couldn't hit a ball at Eaton!
Why?
What's your interest in the Scarlet Pimpernel?
No more than any other woman's.
We would all like to know who he is.
So would your friend Chauvelin,
I'll wager.
What makes you say that?
Isn't that what he is here for?
Did he tell you?
- Why should he?
- Why not?
Mind you, the man is clever...
But a fellow who can't even tie his own cravat...
Isn't likely to put a noose 'round the Pimpernel's neck is he?
Really, Percy.
Can you never rise above trivialities?
Can't rise above anything with more than three syllables, my dear, I never could.
Nonsense!
You were a man once!
A man a woman could look up to.
Could turn to in trouble.
And now...
You wouldn't know where to begin.
Couldn't you begin by telling me what the trouble is?
What is the use?
We don't even speak the same language.
Mr. Richard Brindslay Sheridan.
The Countess de Tournay.
Mademoiselle de Tournay.
The Vicomte de Tournay.
Lord and Lady Elsworthy.
The Earl and Countess of Garrow.
Well, here's our French friend!
Bonsoir, "misu", as you say.
Good evening, Sir Percy.
Milady.
My dear, look at that cravat.
You're a monstrous quick learner, sir.
Permit me.
There...
Perfect.
Perfect!
Another week, and we won't know you from an Englishman.
From an Englishman!
That is praise indeed!
Oh, Sir Percy!
What is this poem everybody is talking about?
- Poem?
- Yes!
All about the Scarlet Pimpernel.
Do tell us!
Oh, gads, there's no escape.
Forgive me my dear.
Take our friend round and tell him who everybody is...
If anybody is anybody.
- That's exactly like you, Percy!
- That's like you.
I only want to know who one person is and you know the alternative..
The Pimpernel is under this roof at this moment among your friends.
Your move, milady.
And good luck.
Marguerite!
Suzanne!
Suzanne.
The thing rhymes, you see, in four places.
And if you can get a rhyme to rhyme...
That, uh, makes it a poem, if you follow me.
Yes, of course, but what is it?
"The Scarlet Pimpernel" by Sir Percy Blakeney, Baronet.
Really, that's only the name!
Well, go on!
"They seek him here,
"They seek him there.
"Those Frenchies seek him everywhere.
"Is he in heaven?
"Is he in...
"That damned elusive...
Pimpernel.
That's marvelous!
It rhymes!
Oh yes!
It's a poem!
"They seek him here,
"They seek him there.
"Those Frenchies seek him everywhere.
"Is he in heaven?
"Is he in...
"That damned elusive Pimpernel!
- Oh, extraordinary.
- Marvelous!
You liked that?
Well, I could tell another one.
Zounds!
That's a monstrous good color!
Hastings!
Who made that coat?
Beagle & Beagle.
Odd's blood!
Sink me if they're not better than our master Treadle.
- Ffoulkes and Dewhurst are free.
- Escaped?
No, released. They are coming here immediately.
Of course, that's why they were released.
To lead a trail to the rest of us.
I shall be in the library at midnight.
His Royal Highness...
The Prince of Wales.
Ladies, please.
Ladies, gentlemen, please.
Ah, Grenville!
Good evening, ladies!
Good evening, gentlemen!
Please, please!
Any news from France, Grenville?
- The worst, sir.
- The King?
Doomed.
Can't we do anything?
We recalled our ambassador a month ago.
Chauvelin had the impudence to accept my invitation.
Will Your Highness permit?
Monsieur Chauvelin the unofficial ambassador of the French government.
Monsieur, we will try to forget the government who sent you.
And look upon you as merely our guest.
A private gentleman from France.
As such are you welcome, monsieur.
Well, ladies...
Did you bet on my horse at Newmarket this afternoon?
I particularly love the whole...
But I didn't want to...
Lady Blakeney with a sad face?
Ha-ha, but sadness is for mere mortals, milady.
Never, never for goddesses.
Alas, even a goddess must have moments when she's a plain woman.
Zounds, madam!
Lady Blakeney could never become a plain woman at any moment.
Ha-ha, that's better!
Now, come and help me through my... my princely paces.
I crave your permission to present Your Royal Highness the Countess de Tournay, her daughter.
This is a pleasure, madam.
Charming, charming!
You and Lady Blakeney must become great friends, madam.
Her friends are my friends.
And her enemies, the enemies... of England.
We poor exiles, madam show our gratitude to England by our devotion to the wishes of Monseigneur.
Suzanne.
- Suzanne!
- Marguerite!
They were schoolfellows in the convent in Paris.
Ah-ha, charming, madam.
Your Royal Highness,
I accepted the Lord Grenville's gracious invitation solely to implore Your Highness to do something to save my husband.
Madam.
The government does everything in it's power to save those who are threatened by death in the prisons of the French Republic.
But if a country goes mad it has the right to commit every horror within it's own walls.
Hastings slipped a note into sir Andrew Ffoulkes' cuff.
Thank you, sir.
Ah, Lady Blakeney.
Won't you take pity on a lonely compatriot?
Are you asking me to dance with you?
Not with me.
With Sir Andrew Ffoulkes.
Why?
He has a note in his cuff.
Get it!
- But listen, Chauvelin...
- Get it!
Your Royal Highness...
Your Graces...
My lords...
Ladies and gentlemen...
Pray take your places for the minuet.
Oh, please, it's nothing.
Just the heat.
Sir Andrew.
Would you be kind enough to see me upstairs?
Of course.
This way, Lady Blakeney.
You'll be all right in a moment.
Lady Blakeney.
Shall I send for a physician?
No, no!
I'm so sorry...
I'll be all right in a minute.
Would you rather be left alone?
No.
Please don't leave me!
Just for a second.
I'll be all right.
How clever of you.
Almost as good as a burnt feather for faintness.
There...
I feel better already.
Would you be kind enough to bring me my fan?
It was a love letter.
And you sacrificed it for me.
What a shame.
But I'll ask her to write you another, shall I?
Suzanne!
Are you feeling better, darling?
I spoiled Sir Andrew's dance.
Would you make it up to him by finishing it for me?
Well?
Did you get it?
He burned it.
But I got a glimpse of what was left.
It began...
Well, go on.
"Start tomorrow myself..."
And ended...
"Will be in library at midnight".
Thank you, Mary.
You can go to bed.
See that Sir Andrew Ffoulkes gets this.
My dear!
Percy!
All right, Brinker.
Well, my dear?
It's about Armand.
He's in the most terrible danger.
They've arrested him at Boulogne!
How do you know?
Chauvelin told me.
When?
Yesterday.
Well, why didn't you tell me when I asked you?
I don't know... I...
He threatened me.
Then why are you telling me now?
Because I thought you might do something for Armand!
You have influence at court.
Didn't you ask your friend Chauvelin for help?
He promised me that...
I don't trust him.
He promised you the life of your brother.
What did you give him in exchange?
What has happened to you, Percy?
Do you... hate me?
Why did you denounce the Marquis de St. Cyr?
So, that's it!
Why did you never ask me what the Marquis de St. Cyr did to me!
You didn't even know him.
No.
I didn't even know him.
Well, then.
But I knew his son.
I was only 17 when he asked me to marry him.
His father heard about it and had me arrested...
And sent to St. Lazare.
Do you know what St. Lazare is?
Do you know the sort of women that are sent there?
I would have killed myself.
Only...
Only what?
The Revolution came.
The ever-glorious 14th of July.
And I was free.
Why this tardy explanation?
I asked you once if you sent the St. Cyrs to the guillotine. You said yes.
You believed it so easily, didn't you?
And yet...
I still ask myself.
"Am I really guilty of their deaths?"
If not you, who is?
He plotted with Austria.
I told a friend.
A man whom I thought a friend.
He denounced him.
The terror did the rest.
Who was that friend?
Was it Chauvelin?
He promised you your brother's life.
What price did you pay for it?
What price did you pay for it?
I paid a horrible price.
Well?
I betrayed the Scarlet Pimpernel.
How?
Ffoulkes had a scrap of paper in his cuff.
I read it and told Chauvelin the Pimpernel would be in the library at midnight.
And was he in the library at midnight?
Chauvelin says he wasn't.
But I think he is lying.
And through my betrayal a noble and generous man might lose his life.
What am I to do Percy?
How can I warn him?
Warn him?
Against what?
Against the danger that threatens him if he goes back to France!
My dear...
If he is the kind of lunatic
I take him to be your warning won't stop him.
But he might be going to his death!
Well, that's all the fellow lives for.
Besides, he doesn't know you're in love with him.
I'm not in love with him.
I admire his heroism, but...
I don't love him.
Oh, but you do, only you don't know it.
I didn't know it myself until a moment ago.
Percy, please don't joke about it!
It's no joke.
Believe me.
Dangerous game, falling in love with a phantom, my dear.
For all you know, he may be a married man.
Who's deeply in love with his wife.
Never.
Why not?
Would any man who was in love with his wife leave her continually to face death?
Would you?
Me?
Zounds! I'm much more romantic than you think.
In a case like that
I wouldn't leave you.
Not even to go to my tailor.
The horses are ready, sir.
Thank you, Brinker.
Are you going away?
Oh, yes, didn't I tell you?
Important business in town.
Goodbye, my dear.
Your tailor, I suppose.
Not only my tailor, but also my bootmaker.
And incidentally...
I want to see what my influence is worth at court...
That little matter of your brother.
Perhaps I can help.
Oh, Percy, if you could...
I'd love you all my life.
Gad!
I must remember that, my dear.
Goodbye.
What is it Brinker?
It's 6 o'clock, milady.
I suppose you want me to leave this room.
I've never been here quite alone, have I?
No, milady.
All right, Brinker, thank you.
Percy!
Percy!
- Brinker! Brinker!
- Milady.
A letter, to be delivered into your Lady's good hands.
- From Sir Percy?
- No, madam.
From his excellency, the French Ambassador.
Where's Monsieur Chauvelin?
He left this morning for France, madam.
All right, thank you.
Brinker!
The carriage.
Very good, milady.
Is Sir Andrew Ffoulkes in?
Yes, milady.
I'll call Sir Andrew, milady.
Lady Blakeney, what's happened?
Sir Andrew, there's no time to waste in talking.
Just listen to me.
Your leader and friend, the Scarlet Pimpernel
- My husband..
- How do you know that, milady?
Do not ask any questions now.
He is in deadly peril.
Chauvelin knows that Percy Blakeney and the Scarlet Pimpernel are one and the same.
How did Chauvelin come to know?
Through me.
Do you mean to say that you betrayed him?
Yes, yes, I betrayed him, never mind how just tell me this...
Has Percy left for Boulogne?
Yes.
- To save my brother?
- And de Tournay.
What is their meeting place in Boulogne?
Why?
- Do you want to...
- Oh, look at me, man!
Do I look like a woman who wants to send her husband to his death?
I want to find Percy, to warn him, to save him or to die with him.
I'll go with you.
Can you bring your friends?
Ten of them.
The rest are in France.
Percy has forbidden us to go over.
It will be the first time we've ever disobeyed him.
I'll save Percy even if
I have to kill Chauvelin.
And if he goes to the guillotine...
I'll go after him.
There you are citizens!
Boulogne has a guillotine of it's own now.
Same as Paris!
That's nothing!
Half the towns in France have got them.
Let her go, Francois!
Good, eh?
So much for the bait.
Now for the trap.
We can't afford to make any mistakes this time.
Remember, it's either the Pimpernel or ourselves for the guillotine.
- Robespierre knows he is here.
- Yes.
The net must be spread with more than cunning.
Blakeney's no fool.
Besides, he's a master of makeup and disguise.
He may turn up as an old woman a peddler with a pack, a peasant with a beard, anything!
They've got the Scarlet Pimpernel!
Quiet!
Quiet everybody!
Quiet!
Listen, my friend
The next time you want to put on a false beard
Choose a good one not a bird's nest that wouldn't deceive a child!
Clumsy idiot!
Let go, you!
I'll teach him to pull the best beard in Boulogne!
I've never been so insulted in my life!
You disgusting, gibbering monkeys!
You'll hear more of this!
An honest woman I am, one of the few in our street!
Stripped naked by soldiers and the searched to see if I was a man!
Listen, Captain.
If I were 20 years younger that's were I should be.
Bravo uncle!
That's the spirit!
Where are you boys serving now?
Oh, we're on leave.
Stealing away the hearts of the girls of Boulogne?
No sir, I'm in love.
Ah, you rascal.
It's the wife of another man?
No, it's my own.
Splendid!
Captain, I’ll tell you a secret.
You and I are the only men in France who are in love with our wives.
Hooray!
Let's drink to it!
Well, here's to it!
Here's to it!
But it'll be hard for you to leave her for this war with England.
You think that's coming, do you?
Surely!
We shall have to teach perfidious Albion a lesson!
Well. it won't take us long to get across the channel.
Will it, boys?
No, no!
Well, gentlemen, good luck!
And...
Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
De Tournay was brought here from Paris yesterday
The same prison as Armand.
I thought so.
Chauvelin's using them as bait.
Search every incoming ship.
Even the smallest fishing boat.
And you...
De Tournay and St. Just have escaped!
Escaped!
How?
God knows.
The Pimpernel knows!
Someone will pay for this!
Where are the jailers?
Missing!
Citizen Chauvelin!
How dare you burst in?
Who are you?
Jailer from the prison!
- So you're the one...
- No fault of mine!
The head jailer would have killed me if I hadn't taken the money to free those accursed aristocrats!
What?
The Pimpernel is taking them to England.
Promised us all jobs there!
But I'm a good patriot,
Citizen Chauvelin.
I'm not losing my head... because I got some information that will save yours.
What is it worth?
What do you know?
Where you can find the Scarlet Pimpernel.
Out with it!
Where?
He told us to meet him at 10 o'clock at the Lion d'Or.
Take him away.
10 o'clock at the Lion d'Or.##
Let fly foresheet!
Let fly foresheet!
There's the Lion d'Or.
Tell the men to get ready to row me ashore.
We must wait for the signal.
Brogard waves the lantern across the window for safe up and down for danger.
Look!
There's the signal.
Safe!
You've all the roads watched?
Every corner... and the beach.
And a troop of dragoons to surround the place?
Waiting outside.
Come on then...
The Lion d'Or.
Good evening.
What do you want here?
This is no place for one of your sort.
I'm the sort that pays well,
Citizen Brogard.
For what?
For a seat by the fire.
I'll wait here for a friend of mine...
And yours.
What should I know of your friends?
You signaled him just now.
You must be expecting him.
What time?
What time?
10 o'clock.
Where can I hide?
Quick, to the attic!
Citizen Brogard?
Yes?
Under arrest.
What for?
Betraying the Republic...
Helping the enemies of France...
Harboring a gang of dangerous criminals...
Smuggling aristocrats out of the country.
That's a lie!
You've got one chance.
Take it, or I'll hang you now from your own sign.
The leader of your gang is coming here tonight, isn't he?
Isn't he?
- Yes.
- What time?
He ordered his boat to be off the point at 10 o'clock.
Ah, but he'll call here for his passengers, won't he?
He might!
Might?
You'll look pretty swinging in the wind.
How does he know it's safe?
What is the signal?
A lantern in the attic window.
Waved up and down for danger... across the window when all is clear.
Come on. sergeant.
That is the wrong signal,
Lady Blakeney.
That will keep Sir Percy away!
This is the right one.
This will bring him here.
I can see you are longing to see him
As I am myself.
What a great actor Sir Percy is.
A thousand ways to cheat the poor, stupid officials of the Republic.
Look, costumes, wigs, paint.
What will he be next?
In what disguise will he arrive when the clock strikes 10?
I must arrange a reassuring atmosphere for him.
An old woman?
No, he has overdone that.
A priest...
What could be more harmless?
And so useful when it comes to the last offices.
Sergeant...
You shall have the privilege of watching over the Republic's most charming prisoner for the rest of the evening.
Milady.
- Duroc
- Citizen?
Everything ready?
The dragoons should be here at any moment.
Arrange for a firing squad as soon as they arrive.
Are you so certain you'll get him?
Quite.
Thanks to a charming friend
I found in there.
- What time is it?
- Quarter to 10.
Remember, he has to think his way is clear.
He must not suspect anything until he's in the trap.
Good evening, Monsieur Chauvelin.
How nice of you to wait up for me.
Well...
I had no idea you were in holy order.
This is only an innocent masquerade like so many of your own, Sir Percy.
Ah, but mine were successful.
Mine may prove successful yet.
You walked in here quite freely but you won't walk out a free man.
A prophet now, Monsieur Chauvelin.
The time for laughing is past, Sir Percy.
I've sought for a year.
Your energy, your ingenuity your audacity have been quite admirable.
But now...
The game is up!
Because all the trumps are in your hand, eh?
Precisely.
This house is surrounded by my soldiers.
I've only to raise my voice
Yes, yes, I see your point.
I see your point.
But suppose...
Suppose I could reach a door?
The night is black.
The sea is mine.
I make a dash!
I don't make a dash.
I don't need to.
Because one of my friends might shoot you...
From behind, hidden in that clock!
Oh, come now...
No one really hides in a clock.
Besides...
I still have...
One more avenue of escape...
Open to me.
Don't move!
Gunpowder!
If I drop this in here...
I fly straight to heaven.
And you know where you fly to.
Don't be alarmed Monsieur Chauvelin.
It's not gunpowder.
Thank you Wilmot.
You just arrived in time.
I've had five delightful minutes with Monsieur Chauvelin.
I trust there was time enough to get
Armand and de Tournay into safety.
Yes, they're safe.
Good.
Now we need five minutes.
Then I shan't trouble you anymore.
For the moment.
We must have the password, Percy.
The password.
Do we have to use force?
Not at all, Sir Percy.
The password is,
"The Channel is Free".
Splendid!
Wilmot...
You get them onto the ship.
I'll take care of our friend and join you in a minute.
That was quite sensible of you...
Monsieur Chauvelin.
Not at all, Sir Percy.
You may go...
Because I know you'll come back of your own free will.
You overestimate the charm of your society.
I told you once, the time for jesting was over.
I have all the trumps in my hand.
In that room upstairs, there's a woman under arrest who has forfeited her life by aiding the enemies of the Republic.
What woman?
Lady Blakeney.
Is the game up, Sir Percy?
Is this the last adventure?
I give up, Chauvelin.
What next?
There is a firing squad outside.
And my wife?
The Revolutionary Tribunal.
That means death!
It would have meant my death if I had not caught you!
Don't be alarmed, Sir Percy.
I don't want your wife's life.
She's free the moment you die.
I offer you a pact.
If you promise to say nothing to her...
If you'll send her on to my ship immediately...
I'll walk up in front of your firing squad.
I accept.
Sergeant!
Bring milady down.
Percy!
I wanted to give my life to save you.
- Forgive me, Percy.
- My dear, it's nothing!
I'm in no danger.
Percy.
I want to...
I want to die with you!
Don't move, Chauvelin.
Our parting would be too cruel, even for you.
Just take her out while she's still unconscious.
My boat should be at the point by now.
Good bye, my sweet.
It's good to know that...
That you loved me...
A little.
Duroc!
Send this lady to the English ship around the point.
If anybody attempts to land, shoot!
Yes, Citizen.
You two go with him.
Do you like poetry,
Monsieur Chauvelin?
"That damned elusive Pimpernel".
No, no... I mean, uh, poetry.
"This other Eden, demiparadise"
"This fortress built by nature for herself"
"Against infection and the hand of war"
"This happy breed of men"
"This little world"
"This precious stone, set in the silver sea"
"This blessed plot"
"This earth"
"This realm"
"This England"
Oh, damn me, I forget the rest.
Firing party, halt!
Left turn!
Ground muskets!
Duroc!
Zounds, now it appears I shan't have time to remember.
Shoulder muskets!
Left turn!
Quick march!
Ready!
Present.
Present!
Fire.
Fire!
Finished?
I'm so sorry, Monsieur Chauvelin,
I had to come back for my hat.
It's such a cursed good hat, you know.
Now, now, don't look at me like that!
Sink me, if you don't think
I'm my own ghost.
Duroc!
Captain Duroc?
I'm afraid it will be an hour or so before poor Captain Duroc will be able to resume his duty.
I regret that I struck him rather violently.
Seize him!
Always so impulsive, my dear Monsieur Chauvelin.
This, ah... is my firing squad.
Allow me to present
Ffoulkes, Dewhurst...
Hastings, Belville, and the rest.
But of course you know all about them.
You look rather excited, Chauvelin.
I think you need cooling down.
So...
Just a peaceful little nap...
Like we had in the Grenville library.
Are we really free, Percy?
Not you, darling.
Chauvelin said you'd be free the moment I died.
It won't be a moment sooner.
Land ahead!
Look, Marguerite!
England!
What's up?
What's happened?
Somebody is a little drunk.
It's Mr. Harker! He's fallen from the penthouse!
- Harker?
- Is he dead?
- I'll say.
- We better call the police!
Come on, let's pick 'em up and carry 'em inside!
No, don't touch 'em until the police get here!
Calling Car 14.
Calling Car 14.
In 13's district, at 921 Lake Street.
921 Lake Street.
Harker Apartments. Investigate an accident.
That's all.
What are you doing, Wilford?
Reconstructing the accident?
I'm afraid I fell.
Yes, I'm afraid you did.
The next time you do it, see if you can't be a little nearer the edge of the roof.
If he jumped from here, it would land him just about where he fell.
Well, why do you say 'jumped'?
Because I'm an inspector and I can say anything I want to.
- I only thought --
- I know.
I've warned you against thinking.
You think I'm so dumb I haven't considered the possibilities of a murder.
 But I have, Wilford. That's why I'm having so much fun.
Who's the young lady?
If I take her word for it, she was Harker's secretary.
Must be pleasant having such a secretary living on the premises.
I wonder if I could've been wrong about you all this time.
Do you know any reason why Mr. Harker would commit suicide, Ms. Terry?
No. I can't imagine him doing it.
- Now, now I'm --
- Wilfred.
Why don't you go in with the doc? He might need you.
Oh. Oh, yes. Yes, sir.
How long have you been working for Mr. Harker?
Only three weeks.
Not long enough to know much about his affairs, eh?
No.
Did he always have his secretaries live on the premises?
I believe so.
Anyone else live here?
Any servants or housekeepers?
You mean a chaperone?
There's only one maid, Augusta.
She's a little bit dumb, but very respectable, I assure you.
Would you like to meet her?
Just a minute.
Thanks.
Where is your bedroom?
In there.
What time did you go to bed?
About 9:30.
I went to my room earlier than that to read.
I heard Mr. Harker go out about nine o'clock, but I didn't hear him come in.
Do you sleep soundly?
I suppose so.
And you heard nothing? No other disturbance until the shriek?
Not a sound.
Alright. Let's see the maid.
This way.
Listen!
That's in her room!
Augusta! Are you alright?
Yes. No.
I am not. There's a man in my room!
- Where?
- Him!
Oh, he's a police inspector.
Mr. Harker's had an accident.
No!
Was anybody hurt?
He's dead. He fell from the roof garden.
Mr. Harker? Oh, the poor man.
What was he doin' hangin' over the roof garden?
That's what we want to know.
Now, were you here all evening?
Yes, I was.
I meant to go out, but I was reading such an exciting mystery...
... all about a green face that floats up to windows.
Can you imagine that?
I don't know how respectable she is, but you were right about the dumb part.
Outside of green faces, did you see or hear anything?
Now, that's funny. I did.
At least I think I did.
I was asleep when I heard it.
But I was dreaming such an exciting dream,
I wouldn't let myself wake up...
 ... for fear of missing the finish.
You could've stayed for the second show.
What?
Nothing. Let it go.
Well, as I was saying. I heard the noise, but I don't know if it was a real noise...
... or just a noise in the dream.
You see, I can hear dreams as well as see them.
Where's Wilfred?
- Wilfred?
- Yeah, my secretary.
I want him to meet Augusta.
They have so much in common.
What was the noise you may not have heard?
It was a sort of hiss.
Like that.
That settles it. You've got to meet Wilfred.
Gee. You're not at all like Phil O. Dans.
Well, that's alright. You're so much like the maids in the mystery novel...
... that I'm almost convinced that Harker was murdered.
Murdered?
If you're through with me for the moment,
I'd like to go get dressed.
Sure, go ahead. But don't leave the apartment.
Pleasant dreams.
Hello, Inspector Russell speaking.
Who lives in the penthouse across the hall?
 Why, it's vacant, sir.
Oh. Who lives in the apartment directly under this?
Mr. and Mrs. Tom Colby.
Well, give 'em a ring and find out if they heard any disturbance up here tonight.
Call me back.
Yes, sir.
Hello, Jim.
Say, listen, Jim, I...
No, no, I...
- Hello, Eddie.
- Hello, Ted.
- What's the latest?
- Oh, nothin' much.
Gang's still waitin' upstairs.
Why don't you go up?
I'm stuck down here. Chief told me.
Oh.
Say, Eddie, you wouldn't like to make a fin, would ya?
A fin?
This another one of your jokes?
No, on the level.
One of those who's upstairs bet me a ten-spot that there was no eagle on the lieutenant's badge.
Do I collect?
Accordin' to my tag, you do.
Wait'll they see that. I'll give ya five bucks for helpin' me win it.
Too easy.
I'll say it is.
I beg your pardon, gentlemen.
Wait a minute.
Who do you think you are?
You must be a new man.
Old enough to know a wise guy like you.
Sorry, Lieutenant. Go right in.
Don't make that mistake again, my good man.
No, sir.
How is it?
Smells alright.
How'd you get in here?
Power of the press.
Well, suppose you just press right out again.
I thought you might need my help.
Not while I have Wilfred.
Beat it.
Alright. You'll be sorry.
- Well?
- No marks of violence.
But it looked like he clutched at something as he went down.
Three of his nails were broken off.
Three of his nails, eh?
Wonder how that happened.
Did you find any evidence of suicide? Any notes?
Nope.
Murder?
Nope. Nobody heard a sound.
Then it must've been an accident.
Yes, I guess it was.
Central 5800.
Morning news? City editor, please.
Mr. Perkins, Pat Morgan.
I don't know enough yet, but you can give it a spread, one of those question things.
'Was Harker murdered?'
Alright, give me your rewrite man.
Hello?
Pat Morgan on the Harker case.
Who?
Stop asking questions and take this down.
I may get stopped any minute.
Okay. Go on.
You can give it a heading in questions.
'Was Harker philanthropist or crook?'
'Who was the mysterious Bee (B - double E) who telephoned Harker's apartment...'
'... two hours before his death and said,
"I've got to see you"?'
'Why was Martini, big underworld boss, a frequent and secret visitor at Harker's apartment?'
Got it. Go on.
'What was the meaning of the serpent card sent to Harker twelve hours before his death?'
I have it, but I'm afraid I can't get it to you tonight.
Describe it.
Picture of coiled serpent in corner of card.
Phonetic spelling of 'hiss' coming from it's mouth.
Letters clipped from newspaper and pasted on card read 'You will hear it'.
Another question. 'Was the hissing sound the maid heard the materialization of the threat of the card?'
And last. 'Was Harker's death accident, suicide, or murder?'
That all?
- Okay.
- Thanks.
I thought I told you to get outta here.
I'm goin'.
Hey. Hey, get a load of this, will ya?
Why didn't you send in the dope on that Harker death?
But I did, Mr. Perkins.
I gave it to a rewrite man.
You gave it to The Express!
I placed you on the spot three weeks before the murder happened!
And when it breaks, we're carrying a spread of the European debt situation!
You're fired!
But --
Hello, close out Pat Morgan.
I found it under the rug, ma'am.
Oh, so that's who it was!
Oh, what a dirty trick!
I'll slash his throat!
What a low double-crosser!
I'll get even with him if it takes my last brain cell!
And he knew it'd cost me my job.
I'll get even with him and how I'll get even! I'll kill him! I'll kill him!
Is it somebody you don't like, ma'am?
Help! Help!
Lordy!
Help! Help! Lordy, Lordy!
What's the matter? What's the matter?
There's a lady dead!
Who?
Ms. Colby done turned blacker than I is!
I'll see you at the office.
Was she strangled?
Looks like it.
You want to see something interesting?
Come here.
Does that suggest anything to you?
Harker could've fallen from here instead of from the roof garden, couldn't he?
He not only could, but we believe that he did.
That broken pole suggests that someone clutched at the curtain in an effort to save himself.
Now Harker's nails were badly broken.
And there are deep scratches in the paneling there.
 And now we'll talk about you.
You don't mind, do you?
Of course not.
What do you wanna know?
Do you know a reporter by the name of Ted Ryan?
 Yeah, I can see that you don't.
Well, he got a lot of first-hand information in his paper this morning and I can't figure out where he got it.
Unless it was from you.
May I see it?
Well? Did he get it from you?
Alright. Now let's have a little talk.
And then I'll decide whether or not I'm going to lock you up for withholding information from the police.
Yeah, Wilfred is on his way down now, with a picture of Colby.
He's been missing since last night.
Broadcast a description of him.
And tell Brown I want all the hotels checked.
 The steamboats, railroad stations.
Send out a general alarm.
When ya get him, book him for murder.
Alright.
Alright, what's your name?
It's Morgan. Pat Morgan.
I'm a reporter on the morning news.
That is, I was a reporter on the morning news, until Ted Ryan pinched my story last night.
What did they do -- fire you?
What was the idea of posing as Harker's secretary?
What are you after?
Harker. My editor got wind of some connection between Harker and Joe Martini.
He couldn't figure what the town's favorite saint was doing in business with a racketeer.
Were they in business?
I don't know. I know Martini was up here several times.
Always late at night, and always when Harker thought I was asleep.
But as far as getting anything definite on him, I didn't have any luck.
How about the Colby woman?
Her name was Bee, by the way.
It was?
Well, that looks like --
The world's oldest story. That's why we're after the husband.
But what I want to know is about that last phone call of hers.
How did you know about it?
I listened in on the extension.
Oh. What did you hear?
A woman's voice, and she said,
'This is Bee. I've got to see you.'
And Harker said, 'Alright,' and hung up.
Talkative huss, wasn't he?
Has Martini got an apartment here?
How did you get ahold of the serpent card?
Do you think there's anything in it?
I'm asking the questions.
How did you get hold of it?
I snitched it out of his pocket.
Been kind of busy, haven't you?
Did you see him when he got it?
How did he act? Scared?
Puzzled. He tossed it in the wastebasket, and then fished it out.
Studied it for a few minutes, and put it in his pocket.
Where is the card now?
I'll get it.
Did you find another one?
- Yeah.
- Where?
In Mrs. Colby's apartment?
In the wastebasket.
What does it mean?
Oh, it's either a threat, or some fake advertisement.
I'm checking now to see if anyone else in the house got one.
Well, is there anything else you want to tell me?
No. But maybe if I stayed on for a few more days, and went through his papers...
... I might run across something.
And as his secretary, I should help settle his affairs.
Don't you think it's a good idea?
I think it's a good penthouse.
You know, I oughtta lock you up.
If we'd have had this information last night about the Colby woman and her husband...
... we'd have Colby now.
What's the use of expecting a reporter to tell a cop anything?
But I'm not a reporter anymore, and I might run across something.
Don't you think it's a good idea?
I think you're trying to flirt with me.
If I didn't have four kids, and a wife that could lick her weight in wildcats...
... I might like it better.
Go on. Stay here.
But don't get the idea that you're smarter than the police.
And don't hold back anything that you find.
Hello?
I think we have Colby for you.
What do you mean 'think'?
Won't he admit it?
He isn't admitting anything.
He's down at the morgue, on a slab.
What? I'll be right down.
What is it? Where're you going?
Have they found Colby? Oh, let me go with you!
But --
But I'm not a reporter anymore. And you can tell me everything in perfect confidence.
Alright, alright.
Mark!
Hey! Hey, Pat!
Hey, follow that car, will ya?
Hurry up!
Well, I made it.
Hey! Hey!
Well, I'll --
Uh-oh!
 What you all got me down here for?
I ain't goin' in that place!
- Oh, yes you are.
- Oh, yes I ain't.
Can't get me in that place. I done seen one dead body today and that's enough.
It's too much, yes, sir!
We only want you to look at a man.
Dead?
Yeah.
Nothin' doin'!
Who is the man?
Colby.
Mr. Colby dead?
Why, I didn't like that man alive!
So what makes you think I'm goin' to like 'em dead?
Why didn't you like 'em alive?
He didn't talk enough. And it's a sure thing he ain't doin' no talkin' now.
All he did was sit around and look at the walls, starin'. That's what.
 And it ain't good when a man don't talk.
Well, it won't be good for you if ya don't get out of that car now.
It ain't gonna be good for me if I does, so I'm stayin'.
You want me to lock you up?
Where?
In the city jail.
They is alive in jail, ain't they? Alright, sir.
Lock me up with the livin'.
- What's the trouble?
- She won't budge.
I ain't anxious to start no trouble, sir, but I just naturally don't like dead people.
You the janitor?
Yes, sir.
You knew Colby before, didn't you?
Oh, yes, sir.
Alright, that's enough of identification. You can go.
- That a way?
- Right.
Yes, sir!
- Here ya go.
- Okay.
Hey!
Hey, Eddie! Open up, will ya?
Hey, listen. Stick around here, will ya?
I may be goin' right back.
- Hello, Eddie.
- Hello.
How's the boy?
Hiya, Sam.
What detained you?
I had some business to attend to.
What you mean is you wasted an hour hanging around the police station.
If you'd picked me up, I'd've told you they were headed for the morgue.
Is it the depressing atmosphere of this place or do I imagine that you're angry with me?
I angry with you? What have
I to be angry with you about?
You only pinched my story and made me lose my job.
And what does that matter?
You lost your job?
Yes, I lost my job. I suppose you think that's very funny.
It's probably the funniest thing you ever heard of.
Probably laughed yourself sick over it.
Oh, no, darling, I --
Hey, it's alright to cry in this joint.
But nix on the lovemaking.
Oh, you go to the devil, will ya?
Come on, darling, let's get outta this place.
He hasn't any romance in his soul.
Let's go to a speakeasy.
What's romantic about a speakeasy?
I'm gonna propose to ya again.
And no cracks from you.
The only funny crack I can think of would have to come from her.
Yeah? What's that?
If she said yes.
Funny man.
You know, darling? Eddie's wife got
'em the job here in the morgue.
She thought he'd take the hint and die.
Come on, honey.
Well, do we go straight to the marriage bureau or do I have to do some more talking?
You have to do plenty of talking.
 Okay, we'll go to Joe's.
I'll even take ya in the cab.
375 West 58th.
Couldn't ya sit a little closer?
Not without being arrested.
And speaking of arrest, did you know that the Harker case was all over?
All over?
Yep, all washed up.
What do you mean? What happened at the apartment?
Plenty. Did you see Harker's maid, Augusta, last night?
I don't think so.
You don't think so?
Well, believe me, darling, you'd remember her.
You called me 'darling'.
I didn't mean to.
Well, she's something to feast the eyes on.
Or was... She was found murdered this morning.
In Harker's apartment?
No, the janitor's.
Say, are you kidding me?
I? Listen, I'm the one who shouldn't trust you -- not you me.
I'm sorry, darling. Go on.
Well, they found a marriage license in the apartment.
Whose?
The janitor's.
It seems she was married to the janitor, but worked for Harker.
Oh. One of those.
Look here, you worked for Harker, too!
Only on a double-cross.
He only made a couple of passes at me.
He made what?
Why, I'll kill him!
Well, he's already dead.
The janitor killed him.
Killed him, and his wife, and then committed suicide.
They dragged his body out of the East River this morning.
That's what they had down at the morgue.
The janitor's body?
And the maid's, too.
Say, listen, has any of the mob got this story yet?
I don't think so.
Hey, driver. Driver, drive up to that drugstore, will ya?
Ya mind if I phone it in?
- No.
- I'll only be a minute.
- Alright, but hurry.
- I'll hurry.
Driver, drive on.
You don't want to wait?
I don't want to wait!
Driver, drive back to the drugstore.
I figured you might wanna go back.
That's why I made that right turn back there.
You know too much.
I've been drivin' a cab for ten years.
I've seen about all there is to see.
Here you are, miss, and there's your man.
Man? Don't be vulgar.
Where'd you go?
- Listen, Ted --
- What's the matter?
That story I told ya about the maid and the janitor...
Well, what about it?
It isn't the truth. I made it up.
I wanted to get even for last night, so I made it up. There isn't a word of truth in it.
Holy smokes!
Haven't you got a nickel?
No.
I didn't know you'd mind so much.
Mind? I phoned that story into your paper.
- My paper?
- Yeah, I wanted to make up for last night.
Haven't ya got a nickel?
No!
I told your editor what happened last night, and I held the scoop up...
... if he'd give ya your job back.
He said yes, so I gave him the story!
Haven't ya got a nickel?
No!
- Terry?
- Yes?
Come in here. I found somethin' just like in a mystery.
Come on, come on.
 What are you doing?
Oh. Mr. Harker's lawyer said I was to pack up
Mr. Harker's things and clear out the apartment.
But look at those drawers.
Mr. Harker's or the wooden ones?
Oh, Ms. Terry, aren't you the one!
The wooden ones! Do you see any difference in them?
Did they come out of the same chest?
They did, and so I investigated.
And look what I found!
I pressed and pressed all around here.
And finally, sure enough, there it was -- a little place behind there.
- Empty.
- But it wasn't.
There was a letter there.
And it reads like a threat.
And he signed himself 'The Juice'.
What?
Oh, that means the electric chair.
Central 5800.
Morning news? Get me to Files, please.
Hello?
Hello, Willie? This is Pat Morgan.
Would you do me a favor?
Why, yes.
Look in the files and see when and where a man by the name of Denny Fagan was executed.
That's all I have is the name.
What? The chair, yes.
And call me back at Drake 604A.
Thanks. And, Willie, see if it says anything about his relatives.
Particularly a brother, or anyone who visited him on the day of his execution.
That's right. Thanks.
Augusta, will you make yourself scarce?
Scarce?
Scarce. In other words, scram.
What are you going to do, ma'am?
If I wanted you to know, do you think
I'd ask you to leave the room?
Oh. I never thought of that.
Will you send the janitor up here right away, please?
Thanks.
Mr. Martini's apartment, please.
Mr. Martini doesn't answer.
Thank you.
- Janitor, miss.
- Yes, come in.
What's your name?
Peterson.
Well, look. Do you have a passkey to all the apartments?
Yes, ma'am.
For ten dollars, would you let me in an apartment for five minutes?
While you stand guard outside?
- What apartment?
- Joe Martini's.
No, I couldn't think of it, miss.
Not for twenty dollars.
Not even if it helped solve the mystery of Mr. Harker's death?
Mr. Harker's death?
Why, that's solved!
I identified Mr. Colby's body myself.
The police said he did it.
Maybe. But I don't think so.
Come on, nobody'll find it out. I just phoned
Martini's apartment and there was no answer.
Now, all you've got to do is stand guard out in the hall.
And if Martini comes out of the elevator, you whistle, or better still, you could hammer on something.
No, I don't like it, miss. I'd be sure to lose my job.
If I get caught, I'll swear I got in with a skeleton key. Come on!
Well, alright. If you'll keep me out of it.
But I don't like it.
Here you are, miss.
Now you stand by this radiator, and if you hear him coming, you hammer on it.
Alright, miss, but I don't like it.
It'll be alright.
Good afternoon, Mr. Martini.
Hello.
Ms. Terry, in Apartment A.
Just a moment.
Hello?
Oh, so it's you!
Well, I've called every speakeasy in town. Where are you?
I'm at home. What's on your beautiful little mind?
Little mind? Plenty.
Listen, I've just found something.
Did you ever hear of a man by the name of Denny Fagan?
What was that? Did you drop something?
No. Don't say anymore.
I'll be right up.
Thank you.
Blue steel revolver.
Black blackjack.
Pink toothbrush.
Well, what in the world?
I'm spending the night.
 - Here?
- Certainly!
You know, I didn't like that sound over the telephone.
Somebody was listening in.
What's this about Denny Fagan?
Do you remember the case?
Certainly. He was sent to the chair for killing Julius Brigman.
Well, look at this.
- What?
- We found this in Harker's things.
Anything else?
Plenty. Guess whose mob he was in.
I couldn't imagine. Not Mr. Josephus Martini's?
Yes, Mr. Josephus Martini's. I just got the dope on it from the office.
There may be something in it, and then again, no.
Listen, if Colby killed his wife, and then Harker and the case is closed...
Who's interested enough in this apartment to listen in over the phone?
Surely Colby wasn't listening in from the morgue.
Let's hope not!
Help! Help! Help me somebody!
Oh, Ms. Terry, where are you?
Right here. Stop shrieking!
It's only a fuse.
I'll call the janitor.
Oh! There's a man in the room!
I just touched 'em!
He's a friend of mine.
Keep your hands of 'em.
Certainly.
Hello. This is Ms. Terry. Will you send the janitor up right away?
The lights have gone out.
Thank you.
 - There's the ice.
- Thanks, Augusta.
 - Want a lemon?
- Yes, Augusta. Lemon.
You know, come to think of it. This Fagan kid was supposed to be mixed up with Martini.
- Oh!
- That got it, miss.
Oh. I'll see if any of the globes are burned out.
Alright, thanks.
Want some more ice in yours?
She's still lookin' for the lemon.
I'll find it.
Some people would thinks I'm a swell guy.
Oh, you're crazy!
Yeah? Well, that's your idea.
You're only showin' off for my benefit. I can use a gun.
You'd probably shoot me and become a widow before you'd tasted the joys of being married to me.
Good heavens, what a man!
Certainly!
Why don't you shut up and go to bed?
Well, I can't very well go to bed with you hanging around here.
I'm leaving.
And if anything should happen, you stay in here and keep the door locked.
Even if I hear you yelling, 'Pat! Pat! Come save me!'?
Certainly! Oh, go to the devil, will ya?
Don't drink all the scotch!
It's beer.
Come on. Stick 'em up and keep 'em up.
Now, then. Maybe you'll tell me what you're doing in here.
Martini!
Yeah. Old dry Martini himself.
Hey, wait a minute. I'll go with ya.
You stay here.
Don't be silly!
There's a deep cut in the head, but I'm not satisfied.
I want an autopsy.
Alright.
Alright, Martini, talk.
No, you talk!
What was one of your men doin' in my place?
Finding enough evidence to send you up for life.
Yeah, and did he have a search warrant?
I wouldn't be a bit surprised.
Weston was probably trying to serve it on you when you killed him.
You'll have to come stronger than that.
I wasn't even in the apartment when he died.
- How do you know when he died?
- I heard him yell.
They heard 'em yell, too.
I was with them when it happened.
So ya can't pin this on me!
Maybe not. But I can about six gang killings on you and that oughtta be enough.
Take 'em down and lock 'em up.
Who, me?
No, Wilfred. I want 'em locked up. Alright,
Brown, take a couple o' men with you.
Yes, sir. Shall I iron 'em?
You bet! And keep your eye on 'em every minute!
This is gonna cost you your job, Russell.
You shouldn't threaten a police officer. It isn't polite.
Get going!
Go up to the penthouse. I wanna have a little talk with you.
You stay here until I come back.
May I make a suggestion --
No, Wilfred. Make it to the doctor. I'm tired.
I wouldn't stay here another night for all the tea in China.
You're smarter than somebody else I know.
I want you to get outta here in the morning.
You're not only in danger, you're just plain dumb.
When you found this letter, why didn't you bring it --
I was going to.
You were going to?
But first, you thought you'd be smart. You had to go messing around in Martini's apartment.
He didn't see me.
He saw you alright. He thought you got the paper that my man got.
He was here tonight to get it back.
And in being here, he saved his own life.
 What makes you think that?
Brains. And a valentine.
 I can't figure out yet how the mistake was made.
But my man got what was intended for Martini.
We found it in Martini's apartment.
Then I was right. Colby didn't kill them.
 Maybe.
- Mail.
- Oh, thank you.
Good heavens, Augusta!
You look like you're going to a funeral.
I am, ma'am. Mr. Harker's!
Oh.
And they're buryin' Mr. and
Mrs. Colby today, too.
And if I hurry, maybe I can catch them both.
Well, have fun.
Oh, Ms. Terry! How you do say such dreadful things!
Who is it?
Where do you want this?
What's the matter, miss? Did I startle you?
Oh, I'm sorry.
But you told me to bring up the trunks.
Oh, I know. I forgot about them.
You can put them anywhere. It doesn't matter.
I wonder could you come down and pick out yours?
I got Mr. Harker's out, but I don't know yours.
Alright.
But couldn't we go down in the elevator?
Yes, ma'am.
You can't get my trunk up here any too quick to suit me.
I just got a warning that
I was gonna be killed.
You, miss?
Oh, who would wanna kill you?
I wish I knew!
Do you live down here?
Over there.
My, but it's dark!
I'm the janitor.
Where's the trunk room?
There, this way.
Aren't there any lights in here?
I'll go in and turn them on.
Why the gas in the bell?
I was just about to light the incinerator.
Well, that can wait. These gentlemen want you to go with them now.
We want to examine some of the apartments.
Yes, sir.
Start in on this one.
If you don't need me any longer,
I'd like to get back to my work.
Alright, but leave us your passkey.
Yes, sir.
May I make a suggestion?
 - No.
- But you --
I'm busy. Some other time, Wilfred.
What do you want?
Why, I...
Help! Help!
Help! Help!
Help! Help!
Help! Help! Help!
Help! Help! Help!
Help! Help!
Help! Help!
Help! Help!
Help! Help!
Help!
Oh, help! Help!
He's killing 'em, in there!
 Pat, Pat! Here, darling.
You're alright.
He tried to get away.
Hi.
Oh, Doctor, how is Ms. Morgan?
Oh, she'll be alright. Just keep her quiet a couple of days.
 Ted!
Try and keep 'er quiet.
May I come in?
Certainly. Hurry up.
- Has he confessed?
- Yep.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten!
Well, tell me about it.
Did he kill 'em all?
Yeah. With the exception of Colby.
 How?
With gas. They've just held an autopsy on all the bodies.
I know. Augusta was nearly broken-hearted because they called off all the funerals.
Why did he kill them?
Revenge. You were right, as usual.
He was Denny Fagan's brother. Fagan was a cab driver, just a kid and, according to him, honest.
Fagan was sharing an apartment with one of Martini's men.
 They used Fagan's cab to take
Brigman on his last ride.
They even planted the gun on the kid!
And he was the only one of the mob that didn't have an airtight alibi.
Ah, gee, ya look cute in that bandage.
Please, get on with the murders.
Well, that's all. Denny Fagan was sent to the chair.
That's all? Isn't that enough?
Just a young kid, too.
You're not going to feel sad about it, are you?
I would if his brother hadn't tried to stuff me in a furnace.
Where did Harker come in?
Harker engineered the Brigman killing.
Brigman was in Harker's way, so he ordered him snuffed out.
Martini's mob found it convenient to let Fagan take the rap.
You mind if I hold your hand?
Please, darling, hold my hand.
But why did he kill Bee Colby?
She wasn't mixed up in it.
No. But by killing Harker and her in her apartment, it drew suspicion on the husband.
He even sent Colby a letter telling him to watch her.
But when Colby found out what was going on, he didn't kill them.
He just jumped in the river.
My, but you take this lightly!
What if I'd been killed?
Oh, baby, I'd've written you a swell obituary.
I'll bet you would've, at that.
In some speakeasy!
Don't be silly, gal. You know
I don't go to speakeasies.
I got an idea!
How 'bout a last drink of Harker's scotch?
I've already ordered it. But you might go see if Augusta's drinking it.
Alright.
Is this... Is this Ms. Patricia Morgan?
This is she.
This is Perkins.
Not dear Mr. Perkins.
Cut that!
You wanna come back?
What do you mean 'how much'?
How much more?
We'll discuss that when I see you.
No, we won't, because you aren't going to see her.
What? Who is this?
Ms. Morgan's future husband.
Who says so?
I do.
A woman's place is in the home.
Hey, listen!
What home?
I have an apartment.
I'll bet the rent isn't paid.
Now, don't be mercenary.
Will you listen to me?
I bet you haven't the price of a marriage license.
I wanna talk to you!
- Augusta?
- Yes, sir?
Will you lend me three bucks?
Why, of course, Mr. Ryan.
I'll get it right away.
Certainly I've got three bucks.
Sure.
See here, Morgan! Haven't you any gratitude in your system?
Do you realize what I've done for you for the last three years?
I've kept you on the payroll of this paper!
I've given you more opportunities than any sob sister in the business!
Oh, let's get together on this thing, Morgan.
There ain't any use of us actin' like this.
You know, we've always been able to iron out the little things.
Morgan?
I say, Morgan!
Why don't you answer me?
Carl Denham.
Mrs. Hudson! Mrs. Hudson!
Get out! I'll have you arrested.
That's my business...
Pretending to be the gas man.
- I'm supposed to...
- The very idea.
All right, Mr. Denham. It's only me.
I am sorry, Mr. Denham. He said he was the gas man. Had a card and everything.
Listen, Mrs. Hudson, as long as I am rooming in your house... if your own father comes to the door, don't you believe a word he says.
It's a pity the people in New York don't try and catch a few gunmen... instead of hunting a nice gentleman like you.
Is Mrs. Hudson there?
Oh, ho. That's the lady in the front room.
- Oh.
- Coming.
I'm from the news.
Is that so? Well, I've got news for you:
You're going to get out of this room so fast...
- No, I'm not.
- Ladies, no riots, please.
If people don't stop getting into my house under false pretenses...
I just want a story.
If I go back without it, I'll lose my job.
- Don't bother to pull that old line.
- You're big news, you know.
What, after a whole month?
That's time enough for New York to forget the World War.
The War was a long way off, but King Kong, the giant ape...
- ...was right here on the spot.
- So I've heard.
And you're the man that brought him here.
Kong is dead. But everybody's interested in you, too, Mr. Denham.
All those people that Kong killed and injured... all the property owners who are suing you for damages, and...
And the theater owners, and the men who put money in advanced publicity, and...
Say, are you telling me?
Why don't you let him alone? He hasn't dared leave the house for a week.
That's what I want, the personal reaction story.
You want to know what the captor of the late Kong...
- ...thinks about, eh?
- Yes.
I thought I had him safe.
Don't you suppose I'm sorry for the harm he did?
I wish I'd left him on his island.
Old Kong, I'm sure paying for what I did to you.
Mrs. Hudson, suppose we look out and count the gentlemen in disguise... who are waiting for me?
If I don't get out of this house pretty soon, I'll choke.
Hey!
Aren't you going to give me a story?
All right, tell my public that Carl Denham, the bright boy... who was going to make a million dollars out of King Kong, is flat broke.
Everybody in New York is suing me for something.
The only place I haven't heard from is the Bide-A-Wee home.
But, Mr. Denham, my readers want to know...
There's a newsboy and a peddler and a taxi driver out there.
I'll bet you a nickel they're all process servers.
- There's a man coming up the steps.
- Huh?
Why, it's Charlie. Let him in.
- Hello, Charlie, what do you want?
- Captain Englehorn send you this.
- Where'd you come from?
- All time, stay on ship.
- Cook for Skipper. Easy job.
- Mm.
Tell the Skipper I'll be over at the ship as soon as I can get out of here.
- What's matter? You scared to come out now?
- You said it. Much obliged, Charlie.
- Maybe you can get out through the basement.
- Come on. Let's try it.
Rags.
Bottles, rags.
You've got a nerve.
I got everything, lady.
And I buy everything.
Rags, bones.
Say, you fresh guy!
Mrs. Hudson.
Mr. Carl Denham.
Well, I'll be. Hello, Mickey.
- Hello.
- Have a heart, will you?
That's 15 of those things you've slipped me.
- I'm the best in the business, Mr. Denham.
- Well, what is it this time?
Steiner and Wayne.
Destruction of property by Kong on 39th street.
Shock, mental anguish, and sprained ankle to owner of said property.
If I don't get out of this house,
I'll bite somebody.
Listen, Mickey, I've got a date.
You've done your job.
How about helping me out-smart those other guys?
Mr. Denham, I'll give you a ride on my junk wagon.
You... Ha, ha. You mean to say you've got a wagon to go with that makeup?
Mr. Denham, I'm an artist.
Hey.
How did you get in there?
You can go from the roof to chimney.
Anthony St. Nick and Santa Claus.
Ooh. Commence.
Rags.
Bottles. Bones.
Rags. Hey, you can take off the tin hat.
You're safe now.
Where are you going, Mr. Denham?
Drop me at the nearest subway station, James.
You know, it's funny how anybody's troubles are somebody's gain.
I've been working steady since you got in this jam.
You've no idea how that cheers me up.
The boy who was going to make a million dollars.
Rags!
So that's the mess I'm in, Skipper.
Kong sure was a hoodoo for me.
I guess next time you leave big monkey alone, huh?
Next time? Ha, ha.
Charlie must think Kongs are plentiful.
Well, Denham, now I'll tell you why I wanted to see you.
- I've got a plan for both of us-
- What is it?
Going to get a couple of megaphones and run sightseeing trips around the harbor?
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Mr. Denham, I...
Mickey.
- One more summons and I'll brain you.
- No, wait, Mr. Denham.
I ain't got no summons. Honest. I ain't.
I come to tip you off.
- Did you follow me over here?
- No, I live over here.
My father-in-law said he saw you come in by the gates.
I feel very friendly to you, Mr. Denham.
You've kept me working pretty steady lately.
Yeah, sure, I know, I've been a big help.
Now, what's on your mind?
I heard this afternoon you're going to be indicted.
- What?
- Indicted.
- The grand jury's going to indict you.
- Let me out of this. I'm going crazy.
You take my tip and get out.
Summons is one thing and grand jury is something else already.
- They are going to put you on the stand.
- Stop it! All right, Mickey, much obliged.
- Now beat it, will you?
- All right. Such a fine customer.
Oh, Denham?
- Denham, I...
- What good is the grand jury?
What can they find out?
I brought Kong back here, he got loose, did a lot of damage... got killed, and that's that.
- What can I do about it?
- We can go to jail for 10 years.
- What do you mean, "we"?
- I'm in it, too, up to my neck.
Now, see here. This ship's still mine.
There are no attachments on her yet.
- They just haven't got around to you.
- That's a good reason for hurrying.
In three hours, I can get together a skeleton crew, enough to handle her.
Yeah, and we'll go yachting.
We can make some sort of a living carrying freight.
Take the East Indies.
There are hundreds of little ports there that no sizable ship ever goes to.
- I know that part of the world.
- What'll we use for money?
Well, I... I've saved up a little.
Enough to get us started.
- Yes, but...
- Come on, Denham.
You know, Skipper... you're pretty swell to be willing to take me with you.
- Is it a go, then?
- What?
To be off on this old ship again, out of all this?
Say, you bet it's a go.
Well, this looks like a hustling community, Skipper.
Suppose we can get any business here?
Better get some soon, or we won't be able to pay the crew.
Say, uh, how far is it to Kong's island?
1,753 miles.
Well, you're pretty glib with that.
You must have been checking up.
Huh? Oh.
I just happened to come across our old chart last night... and I was curious.
Yeah, sure.
- Bosun.
- Yes, sir.
Get that number two hatch off and break out the cargo.
That won't take very long.
If we weren't so short-handed,
I'd get rid of that man.
He's a troublemaker.
Of course, Wong Ho would have to ship his copra last week.
Well, let's see.
There's a couple of half-caste traders here.
We might see them tomorrow...
- ...and get a bit of a cargo.
- Look, Skipper. There's a show in town.
- I'll bet it's terrible.
- Don't be a crab, Skipper. It's a show.
We ought to see it.
- I want a drink and some dinner.
- There's plenty of time for that.
You don't mean to say you're going to miss the sagacious seals?
Don't you want to laugh and thrill with La Belle Helene?
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you.
Come, Bobby. Come, George.
Come, Fattima. In with you.
And now, La Belle Helene!
Sweet songstress who has appeared before all the crowned heads of Europe... will conclude the performance... with one of her most popular songs.
La Belle Helene!
Oh, I've got the runaway blues
I want to wander away
Oh, I've got the runaway blues today
Don't want to stay
I know that trains are going somewhere
And steamers are sailing the blue
They go, but baby, what do I care?
'Cause none of them's going to you
Poor kid.
- You know, she's got something.
- It certainly isn't the voice.
Voice, who cares? She's got personality.
Somebody'd show her what to do with it.
I hear the steamer whistle crying
Whoo, whoo
It's just an echo when I'm sighing
Whoo, whoo
You ran away and never told me
What for, what for
And now your arms will never hold me
No more, no more
I don't want the train on the track
Don't want the ship on the sea
Why? 'Cause they ain't bringing you back to me
Poor me
Thank you for your kind reception of our efforts.
And remember, another big show here tomorrow night.
Well, if that's your idea of a pleasant evening, I...
It's interesting, Skipper.
I'll bet you could take a kid like that... and put her over to the producer of a musical comedy.
- But not to the captain of a freighter.
- Ha, ha.
Father, is that man coming again tonight?
Yes, he is. Any objection?
Can't I have a friend drop in?
- He isn't a friend.
- Well, he's a white man...
- ...somebody to talk to.
- Somebody to drink with.
That's enough. Shut up now and go to bed.
You can't get away from here. No money.
How you think you can get away from here? Huh?
Your Dutchman will be here in a couple of days, won't he?
Dutch magistrate? Ha!
What do you think he'll do for you?
He don't care what happens to you and your rotten little show.
Not a rotten show.
I was ringmaster in the biggest circus.
Used to play Colombo, Singapore.
Sure, and you was rotten.
Who're you calling... Who are you?
- Rotten captain!
- You lay off me.
Rotten captain, lost ship.
Lost it on purpose, eh?
Tried to get the insurance...
- ...didn't you?
- Shut up.
Poor captain.
Lost ship, lost job.
Lost certificate.
Ah, dry up, you old tramp.
You're a tramp.
No certificate, no job.
You're no better than me.
And you just lay off my liquor, will you?
Give it back.
Father! Father!
Father!
Father, Father, tell me what happened.
Who did it?
Tony.
Tony, come down.
Tony.
Tony, please, come down.
Tony.
Tony.
- Tony.
- You'll never catch a monkey that way.
- Did you ever catch a monkey?
- Did I ever...? Ha, ha.
Lady, you'd be surprised.
They won't come back.
Oh, well, why should they?
Oh, uh...
I saw your show last night.
How'd the monkeys get away?
I had to let them out.
The tent burned.
Where's the man who owns the show?
He's my father.
He was hurt.
He's dead.
Well, what a tough break.
I'm sorry, kid.
My father used to be with World Wide.
- That's the biggest circus in the East.
- Yes, I know. What did you do?
I was in the ballet.
I wasn't very good.
What happened to World Wide?
Well, my father... Well, he sort of drank.
You know.
And...
They didn't want him anymore.
- So he started his own show.
- Yes.
Well, we just had a few monkeys.
It wasn't very good.
Say, that's no way to talk.
"I wasn't very good, the show wasn't very good."
Cut it out! You want to tell everybody how good you are.
Throw out your chest. Brag about yourself.
Oh.
So you're in the show business too.
No, I'm in the shipping business.
- I just put in with the cargo.
- Oh.
I thought maybe you had a show, and I could...
No, I'm sorry.
Well, I've got a date.
Are you going to be all right?
I mean, have you got any money?
Yes.
Well, keep your chin up.
I'll be seeing you.
Miss, I heard about your father.
- If I could do anything...
- You've done enough.
You killed my father.
Killed? Why, what...?
The tent caught fire.
My father was beaten over the head.
He wasn't burned.
What do you think the magistrate will say to that when he gets here?
You can't accuse me.
- You wasn't there.
- How do you know I wasn't?
Unless you were.
How do you know what my father said to me before he...?
Before he died?
He... What did he say?
The magistrate will be here in a few days.
I'll tell him.
You better be careful.
What are you going to tell the magistrate?
You can just wonder about that till he gets here.
- There isn't a pound of cargo for us here.
- What'll we do now?
Might pick up some business in the Banda group.
It's a dull life, Skipper.
We need excitement.
Carl Denham.
Don't you remember me?
- Nils Helstrom.
- Well, for the love of Mike. Helstrom.
Sure, I remember you.
This is Captain Englehorn.
Captain Helstrom. Sit down.
Say, do you know who this is?
The man who gave me the map of Kong's island.
And he wants to know if I remember him. Ha-ha-ha!
Have a drink.
So, that was your ship came in last night?
Mine and Denham's.
I heard about you in Singapore.
How you'd captured the biggest animal on earth and taken him back to New York.
Agh.
I'm down, Denham.
- Don't you think you owe me something?
- Ha, ha.
Well, sir, you certainly came to the right man.
- How about a 50-50 split?
- You mean that?
Sure, I mean it. I'll give you half of everything I made out of King Kong.
- How much would that come to?
- Well, let's see, 10... no, 11 lawsuits and the privilege of being indicted by the grand jury too.
- Ah. Then you're broke too?
- Broke? I'm shattered.
Well, then how about giving me passage on your ship?
- I want to get away from here.
- Where's your own ship?
I lost her on the Banka reefs.
- Tough luck. No job since?
- Everyone is down on me.
It wasn't my fault.
You know what those waters are like.
Will you take me to some port that isn't Dutch?
- What's the matter with the Dutch?
- I tell you, they're down on me.
I want to make a fresh start.
You realize how far we'd have to go to land you out of Dutch, uh... jurisdiction?
We can't run all over the Indian Ocean carrying one passenger.
Sorry, old man. Have another drink.
But, Denham, when you got Kong off that island... didn't you get the treasure?
- What?
- Didn't you find the treasure?
Find it?
Why, I never even heard of it.
- Say, are you kidding me?
- Why should I?
To tell the truth, I had an idea
I'd go and look for it myself someday.
You held out on me, eh?
How much do you know about this treasure?
Well, not a lot.
Dying native I picked up at sea...
You drew the map from his description, and he told you about the great wall.
Yeah, he talked about the treasure of the island.
Who put it there?
Why, the people who built the wall.
Yes, that might be.
Skipper, do you remember I said there wasn't a reason... on Earth for going back?
Look. The answer to a prayer.
We're off again.
Hello. I heard you were stopping here.
Felt a little worried about you.
Thought I'd better see you before I go.
- Are you going?
- Yes. Off tonight in a big rush.
- On your ship?
- Yeah, sure.
There isn't any other way to get out of this place, is there?
Oh, uh, here, you take this.
- Can't I go too?
- What?
- Let me go on your ship.
- Nix, kid, nix.
We're going on a long voyage.
We won't be putting in at any port where we could leave you.
Don't leave me. Please, take me with you.
I won't be any trouble.
I'll just sit on the ship.
I won't talk or anything.
Listen, kid, I can't. Honest.
Now, you take this money and buy yourself a passage on the next ship... that's going where you want to go.
- Go on, take it.
- Let me go with you.
Please. Please.
No, no, no, nothing doing.
Now, you take it. Sorry it isn't more, but that's the best I can do.
There'll be a schooner or something along pretty soon.
I can't take you, kid. You'll be okay.
You just make a plan and stick to it.
- All right.
- That's a good girl.
It's a pretty tough life, isn't it?
Well...
Good luck.
- Weather's made-to-order, Skipper.
- I hope it holds.
The next land we sight will be Kong's island.
Yeah.
That fellow Helstrom is getting too chummy with the crew.
- I don't like it.
- Why don't you call him down for it?
What's your opinion of Helstrom?
Well, he got in some trouble over losing his ship, I guess.
That's pretty plain.
He certainly was anxious to leave Dakang.
And he isn't at all anxious to get to Kong's island.
Have you noticed him when we talked about the time we were there?
- Think he's scared?
- Scared green.
Green now and yellow later on, eh?
- Does he expect us to go ashore?
- Why, sure.
He's got to have a bodyguard, hasn't he?
Say... do you know there was a dozen sailors killed on the last voyage he made here?
- Killed? By them animals?
- Yeah.
But, you see, Denham and the skipper came out all right.
But you don't have to worry.
There's plenty of rifles aboard.
If I was captain, I certainly wouldn't take my crew into danger.
- Hey!
- What?
Wha...?
Hey, Bill.
Where?
Hey, Connelly.
If you want me to, I'll give Helstrom a tip that he's too thick with the crew.
Go ahead. Bad for discipline.
We must be in Russia. Here comes the Committee of the Workers.
- Captain Englehorn.
- Well?
- Captain, I went down in forward hold.
- Well, what of it?
- Captain, I found something.
- What's the matter? Found what?
Holy mackerel.
- I just didn't have anywhere to go.
- All right, go back to your work.
This young lady a friend of yours,
Mr. Denham?
No. Well... yes. I met her, that is,
I talked with her in Dakang.
Look here, this isn't my fault.
I told her she couldn't come.
Well...
We can't take her back. Mr. Helstrom.
You ought to be beaten to a pulp.
You called me?
Yes, we have a passenger, and she...
You. How did you get here?
This is our partner.
I know him.
You do?
Yes, of course, you couldn't help seeing each other in Dakang, could you?
Well, here we are.
Just one big, happy family.
You take the words right out of my mouth.
You keep your mouth shut.
You promise me to keep quiet.
I won't promise.
You crazy brat. Denham's sore at you anyway for being here.
You try to make trouble between us, and he'll be off you for life.
Skipper's looking for you.
Say, I don't know what's the matter with you and Helstrom... but we're all cooped up together on this ship.
I didn't ask you to come.
You're here on your own hook.
No matter who you like or dislike... you've got to behave and be pleasant.
Understand?
Are you mad at me?
Not very.
It's, uh... This is nice, isn't it?
It's all right.
Mr. Denham.
- Mr. Denham.
- Yeah?
Skipper says get dressed and come on deck.
Okay. What is it?
Have we sighted the island?
Yes, sir, about two miles off.
- Say, it's a thrill coming back here.
- Yes, sir.
You had a pretty bad time when you were here before, didn't you?
Yeah, it's a pretty tough spot.
The natives will be glad to see us.
We did them a good turn once, and I...
What the...?
I'm warning you all.
You're crazy to do a thing like this.
We're not crazy enough to go to that island.
- What is it, Skipper? Is this on the level?
- It's real enough.
- Where's Helstrom? They get him too?
- All right.
Over that side to the lifeboat.
All of you.
So this is why you've been spending so much time in the foxhole.
- What do you think you're doing?
- We know what we're doing.
Come on, get over the side.
You can row yourselves to your blasted island and stay there.
Yes, and if those animals kill anybody, it won't be us.
Yes. Get going.
Because you pay us your dirty money, you think you own us.
You sweat and drive us, but you don't give us a living wage for our blood and sweat.
- When did you do all this sweating?
- You think you own us, body and soul.
- Oh, listen to reason.
- We've listened enough.
We've got the ship and we're going to keep it.
- Over the side.
- You're not going to shove this kid off too.
She followed you aboard the ship, she can follow you off.
Do you think I want to stay? I know.
Here's your chance to get rid of me.
- He killed my father.
- What?
He was a drunken old tramp.
I didn't kill him.
I know you did.
He said you'd be angry if I tried to make trouble.
Well, what a fine partner you've turned out to be.
Aw, pipe down. Get going.
Of course, you know what this will mean when you get caught.
Listen, I'll call the whole thing off now.
We'll turn back.
Sure, and be arrested for mutiny as soon as we reach port.
I'll give you my word I won't report you.
It's too late for that kind of talk.
We'll stick by what we've done.
Over the side and see how you like it.
I'll be seeing you again, I hope.
What do you think the chances are?
- Charlie, they throw you off too?
- No throw off. Get off.
Me no like them men.
- Cast off.
- Wait.
Aren't you going to give us any guns?
We've given you food and water.
You're lucky to get that.
A smart man like you don't need a gun.
Good boy, Charlie.
You cook now, you die pretty soon.
Row, you blasted bourgeois.
You got a nice day for it.
Now, then, go to your places.
Stokers below.
Bosun.
- Get that ladder up.
- What was that?
I said, get the ladder up.
Oh! And I promote you.
- You'll be mate now.
- That's fine. Who's gonna be captain?
I'm taking command, of course.
Clear the decks. Get back to work.
Do you think that we got rid of a good captain... so we could have a bad one?
We're through with captains on this ship.
He wants to be boss.
Let him go with the rest of the bosses.
Yo-ho!
Ha!
That's where all captains belong, over the side.
Bon voygee, Captain Helstrom.
Something tells me we've got a passenger.
Well...
How nice to see you again, under the circumstances.
Skipper, have we got to save him?
Hey, Skipper, when the natives see us,
I bet they'll throw a party.
Well, maybe not a party.
It's the chief.
Hey, did you throw that, you rat?
He says yes, he did, because his village is destroyed... and his people are killed, and it's all our fault for leading Kong inside the wall.
Well, tell him not to attack us.
Tell him we overcame Kong... and we're still big mates.
Come on, Charlie, shove off.
We've got to find another place to land.
What's the good of this?
There's no way out.
Well, it's the only place we've seen where we could get a foot ashore.
Maybe we can climb up someplace.
You stick with me, kid.
A fly couldn't climb out of here.
Yeah, here's a way out.
Wait till I take a look.
- Uh, captain, I...
- Huh?
- About that mutiny, I...
- The less said, the better, Helstrom.
We're all in a tight place together, and I don't think you'll let us down.
No, no, of course not.
Of course not.
- I didn't know that you came.
- You said stick to you.
Do you obey orders?
Why doesn't Denham come back?
We'd better go look for him.
A smart man like you don't need a gun.
Ha!
Look!
Well, if it isn't the little Kong.
He's stuck in the quicksand.
He can't get out.
I never knew that old Kong had a son.
Don't you think we ought to help him?
Well, how?
If we could get logs and things to him, maybe he could get out.
- Aren't you afraid of him?
- Yes, sort of.
Well...
It sounds kind of silly, but I'm sorry for him.
So am I. But I've got a reason.
Animals always know when you're trying to help them.
I don't believe he'd hurt us if he got out.
I suppose we're both crazy, but let's try.
Look out, Skipper, that's quicksand.
Skipper, there's a...
Skipper, believe it or not, there's a little Kong.
What? A little...
- How little?
- Well, just a little one.
- About 12 feet high.
- Good...
Well, what happened? What did you do?
I know it sounds funny, but instead of shooting him, I helped him out of a jam.
I felt...
Well...
I felt I owed his family something.
You really feel conscience-stricken about King Kong, don't you?
Whatever you do, don't mention Little Kong to Helstrom.
- He'd have a nervous breakdown.
- I'd like to break his neck.
We ought to go hunting and save our rations for emergencies.
This is cut right into the side of Skull Mountain.
My guess, that temple.
- Maybe big devil live in there.
- A temple?
Helstrom, suppose the treasure should be hidden here.
That certainly would be wonderful.
- You'd better come along with me, Helstrom.
- We'll meet here at sundown.
My go with Skipper.
Unh!
I'd forgotten you.
You'd better wait right here.
We'll all be back soon.
Do you think I'm going to stay here alone?
Well, all right, then, come on with me.
But be quiet.
And don't talk.
I thought tropical jungles were full of fruit.
That's what everybody thinks who's never been...
Look.
Well, we won't starve, anyway.
Good boy, Little Kong.
Say, can he scrap, just like his old man.
- Look, he's hurt.
- Huh?
Poor Little Kong.
Do you suppose he knew he was helping us?
Of course not.
You want me to believe he was grateful?
Well, he did save us, didn't he?
And how do we know what animals think?
Let's go and help him.
Are you game?
Yes, if you are.
Wait.
If you talk, very calmly... sometimes that keeps animals quiet.
- You frightened him.
- Yeah, that's too bad.
Was I too rough with him?
Poor old boy.
Baby Kong.
Yeah, some baby.
You're not a patch on your old man.
I must be completely cuckoo to be doing this.
Giving you a ﬁrst-aid treatment instead of running like blazes.
Guess it must be remorse or something.
You see...
I'm the guy that knocked out your pop with a gas bomb and then... carried him off to New York in chains.
I've been sorry for it ever since.
Yeah, you see, the poor old geezer got shot at the finish.
I guess if I'd left him alone... we'd all have been better off.
This is sort of an apology.
There you are, boy.
Two good deeds in one day for something that size... we ought to be caught up on our good deeds for a year.
I wish I had one of those coconuts.
I'll see what I can do about it.
Hey, look what you're doing, you big dummy.
I wish you'd be a little more careful of what you wish for.
Hey.
You better lie down and do your sleeping.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to go to sleep.
I was helping you keep watch.
I have to keep watch of you.
That's the third time I've caught you.
Aren't you going to signal the others again?
Well, there's no use wasting any more ammunition.
They'd have answered those shots
I ﬁred if they'd heard them.
You better lie down.
Here.
Take my coat for a pillow.
- You'll need it.
- No, I won't. I'll keep the fire going.
There you are.
You're a grand little scout.
I'm sorry I got you into all this mess, kid.
You didn't.
I came.
Well, then I'm glad they wouldn't let you stay on the ship.
But I'm just another trouble.
You told me not to come on the boat.
- Good night, kid.
- Good night.
It's gone.
What fashion animal you call that, huh? I no like.
Here's your gun.
Well, that leaves only one shotgun among us.
It's light enough now.
We better go and look for Denham and the girl.
Mm. Heh.
- Well.
- Good morning.
Good morning.
- No sign of the Skipper?
- No.
I'll fire one more shot.
Our guardian angel.
Hey, look.
I'm going to try and get into this place.
If you have no objections.
You're sure you don't mind?
Well, that's fine.
Listen, you attend to your business and I'll attend to mine.
Look! The treasure!
The treasure of the island!
I was expecting you.
Come on, baby.
We've found it!
Please, Little Kong, help us.
Hand it down.
Attaboy, Kong.
Stick to me, kid, and you'll wear diamonds.
Look at them.
Just look at them. We're rich.
We're all rich.
Well, what are you going to do with them?
Huh?
Yeah, I guess maybe a sailboat would be more useful.
Hey, put that down.
Hey, look out!
You'll shoot yourself, you half-wit.
Hey!
Hey, look out! You want to kill somebody?
Sure, you've fixed everything now.
You big rummy.
Do you think he's dead?
Denham.
That's the Skipper.
- What's happened? Where's your gun?
- It's broken, Skipper, but listen...
What? Both guns gone? We can't stay here. Let's go back to the boat.
Helstrom, the treasure, I...
You fool, there never was any treasure.
Let's go, let's get out of here.
Then that was just a yarn you were giving me.
Of course. I had to tell you that to get away from Dakang.
Then there isn't any treasure at all?
Helstrom. Helstrom.
- He's going to the boat.
- Why, that crazy fool may take it.
Let's go after him.
I'm going back for the rest of the treasure.
Make sure of the boat.
I'll catch up with you. Hurry!
Earthquake!
My poor kid.
It doesn't seem to matter very much.
Stick to me and you'll wear diamonds.
Look.
Look.
Ship.
Ship.
Hello, kid.
What are you thinking about?
Poor Little Kong.
Do you suppose he knew he was saving my life?
Well, I'm sure he did.
Pretty soon, when we get back... you'll be saying goodbye to me, won't you?
Yeah.
What?
Where are you going?
I don't know.
Well, you'll have plenty of money, kid.
We'll split the treasure four ways.
Couldn't you just split it... three ways?
How do you mean?
Well... one-third to the Skipper, one-third to Charlie... and one-third... to us.
Well, you said stick to you.
This is nice, isn't it?
It's all right.
But, gentlemen, this is Mysang, the heart of the Moro country, the poison spot of the Philippines.
To take the army out of there at this time is suicide.
I tell you, you mustn't let them do it.
You know what happened at Tagula.
Alipang's on the march, he's taking village after village.
I tell you, we mustn't withdraw the troops from Mysang.
Quite so, Colonel.
On the other hand, I mustn't quarrel with the War Department.
They've ordered the army out of Mysang at once.
And what happens to those poor Philippine natives?
You train them to defend themselves.
Against Alipang?
I couldn't get them ready in 10 years.
And I'm afraid
Alipang won't wait that long.
He's got thousands of Moro bandits in the jungle just waiting for the American Army to leave.
It'll be slaughter.
You'll have to stop him, Colonel Hatch.
With what? Raw native troops?
Yes, with native troops.
As long as our army's there the Filipinos will depend on them.
Sooner or later, they'll have to take care of themselves.
It's your job to prepare them.
We're making Mysang a sort of test.
If it works out there, it's bound to work out in the rest of the islands.
Well, I can tell you now, as soon as Alipang learns the troops have left, he'll pounce on us.
In 48 hours, I'll be screaming for help.
There'll be no one listening, Colonel.
These are the men who are going to help you.
This is Manning.
We picked him, because he knows the Moro country.
This is Hartley.
The best drillmaster and disciplinarian in the service.
This is Larson.
He never disobeyed an order in his life.
And this is McCool.
He never took an order in his life, but he's the best one-man army in the Philippines.
Who's that?
This? Oh, this is
Canavan, the doctor.
He's been ordered to Mysang to keep the other four alive.
Your orders, Colonel.
- Thank you, sir.
- Good luck.
All right, men, fall in. Come on, Jake!
Hey, Jake!
Come on!
All right, men. Get in, get in.
Look alive, men.
We, who are about to die, salute you.
Now, Padre, I've tried to tell you...
We have been praying since dawn for a miracle that would stop the American troops from leaving Mysang.
I'm afraid not even a miracle can change the orders of the General Staff, Padre.
Now, I've been here for some time.
Let me tell you what'll happen here.
I have been here all my life.
I know what will happen here.
And soon. Soon.
Alipang is bringing together all the Moro tribes on Mindanao.
As soon as the American troops are gone, the Moros will come down from the hills.
They will kill all the men, and carry away all the women and children into slavery.
For you, it will be a report written in ink.
But for my people, it will be a report written in blood.
Hard on your starboard, hard on board, boys.
How many
American officers have been left?
A handful.
One by one, they must be destroyed until they send the troops into the jungle to seek revenge.
Who's in command of the post?
Colonel Hatch.
We begin with him.
Amal.
Let me carry the bags!
- Let me carry the bags!
- Let me carry the bags!
- Let me carry the bags!
- Let me carry the bags!
- Let me carry the bags!
You haven't, by any chance, got leprosy?
What's the Indian sign you've got on those other kids, anyway?
You're not a Filipino, are you?
No.
A Moro?
Oh, so that's it.
What's your name?
Miguel.
All right, Mike, you can take my bags up to the headquarters.
You bet your life.
Swede.
Look. It's Bill.
The doc.
Company, dismissed!
Dismissed!
Bill, you old sawbones, how are you?
How are you?
Hiya, Doc, welcome to Mysang.
How are you, Swede?
You still boiling your water?
Did you bring any beer with you?
How's "Vinegar" Steffens, huh?
Oh, they call the old colonel
"Honey Boy" Steffens now.
- I took out a gallstone out of him.
- You did?
Yeah. Oh, here.
Present for you.
Oh, how did you know?
All my life, I've wanted a gallstone.
Still collecting orchids, Swede?
- Sure.
- Here.
Orchidacea dendrobium.
Hey, I've been looking for one of these all my life.
Ain't that a beauty?
Colonel Hatch, this is that Datu I told you about, the friendly Moro chieftain.
- He's been very helpful.
- How do you do?
Sit down.
Colonel, the Datu agrees that there'll always be trouble as long as Alipang's around.
There will never be peace until you go into the jungle and destroy him.
We're not going into the jungle or any other place.
We're here to preserve peace and train the native troops.
Say, what kind of a place is this?
What have you got around here?
Oh, everything.
Malaria, small pox, typhoid...
Poker, pinochle, blackjack.
...lice, mice, alligators, crocodiles, red ants, white ants, and now rats.
The Smith brothers.
They're collaborating with me on some work I'm doing on beriberi.
The Koran says that rats are creatures of ill omen.
Well, Captain, it's in our laps now.
From now on, the little brothers will have to stand on their own feet.
If they can.
If they can.
Allah!
You'd better go in, Padre.
I thought I missed when I shot at that juramentado, but I guess I didn't.
He had enough lead in him to sink a battleship.
Doctor, a juramentado is like a horse.
The only place to stop them is right here.
Only you feel sorry for the horse.
I've heard of these fanatics that go berserk.
But I never saw one before.
I wonder what kept the bugger going with all those slugs in him?
Must be some drug.
The drug that keeps them going is what keeps most of us going.
Faith, good or bad.
The juramentado believes that when he kills an infidel, it is a passport to heaven.
But I didn't know they selected the victims.
I thought they just attacked the first Christian they met?
I am a Christian, yet he didn't attack me.
Well, perhaps, I am not a good Christian.
Good night, señores.
Good night, Padre.
Well, when you come to think of it, that Moro went right by the bunch of us to get to one man, the Commanding Officer.
I wouldn't be surprised if...
Bolo cut?
Do you ever have headaches?
- No.
- Dizzy spells?
No. I'm perfectly all right.
You must have a skull of cast iron.
Bad place for a bolo cut, the nerve center.
I knew a man up in Samoa...
Are you the man that owns that coconut raft?
What were you doing in the jungle?
Who are these men?
Couple of Moros who don't belong in the village.
Where did you find them?
Well, we went for a little stroll and we found them prowling around on the edge of the jungle.
Lieutenant, you know the orders about reprisals.
Captain, all I know is that Colonel Hatch...
He gave the orders.
Come in to the office.
Captain, look, give me a squad.
Let us try some of this juramentado business.
That's what I want to talk to you about.
Gentleman, I've been looking over
Colonel Hatch's notes.
His plan of procedure.
He felt that Alipang would use every effort to lure us into the bush before we were ready.
Well, he was right.
That juramentado was
Alipang's first move.
But it won't work.
We're going to stay right in our own backyard.
Here's an order Colonel Hatch prepared forbidding any move into the jungle until the native troops are fully trained.
He never got a chance to sign it.
How am I gonna get any orchids if we can't go out in the jungle?
Ask him if we can go a little way.
- Go on. Ask him.
- Shut up.
Well, it's signed.
Captain Hartley, it's your job to make soldiers out of these Filipinos if you have to work them 24 hours a day.
From now on, it's drill.
Drill, drill, drill!
Left arm, cut and parry, engage!
Right arm, cut and parry, engage!
One, two, three, four.
Right, left.
Hey, you, number three! Right face!
Chest out!
Stomach in! Raise shoulder!
Forward, double time, march!
Hurry it up. Hurry it up. Come on.
Over the wall. Come on.
Come on. Come on.
Come on, come on.
That was lovely, boys.
Left arm, cut and parry.
Over the wall.
Come on. Come on.
Ready! Come on, come on, come on, quicker!
Like a lot of old women in a sewing circle.
It's still too slow! Do it again!
March, left. Hup, two, three, four...
That's it.
Left, right, left.
- One, two, three...
- Lieutenant Yabo.
Company, halt!
Why are these men drilling without shoes?
Tenyente Canavan, he said take them off.
Oh, he did, did he?
Have them put them on again.
Sergeant.
- Yes, sir.
- What's going on here?
Tenyente say we do this one hour every day.
- Tenyente...
- Tenyente who?
Tenyente Canavan.
What do you mean by telling the men they could drill without shoes?
Shoes? Oh, yes.
Well, it was just a suggestion.
I happened to be passing by and they were having an awful time.
In agony.
They've got to get used to shoes, sooner or later.
Well, don't you suppose it can be done gradually?
After all, men weren't born with shoes.
Dr. Canavan probably meant it as a health measure.
Is it a health measure to rig up a dummy and have men standing around pulling its nose?
Oh, that.
Oh, that was just a little applied psychology.
The Filipinos are scared stiff of this what's-his-name, Alipang.
They jump when you mention his name.
That's why I rigged up that dummy.
Stupid.
You wouldn't think it was stupid if you'd seen the shaking lineup of men at sick call after Hatch was killed.
Sick call is a good excuse to avoid work.
Yeah, I know.
And it's true that there was nothing organically wrong with those men, but they were sick just the same, sick with fear.
And when fear becomes so deep and unreasoning, it's a disease.
It'll be cured when they learn how to handle a gun.
You stick to your pills.
And I'll take care of the training schedule.
Captain, there's a man who either has high blood pressure or something on his mind.
Just as I've always dreamed it.
Taken me years to find, but here it is.
As green as Ireland, not a snake in the place, and a beach like powdered sugar.
Have you seen my fatigues?
Look, Bill,
10 miles south of there.
Mac, don't tell me you've finally found your island?
Yeah. And as soon as we finish up this job, I'm moving in.
That'll be the world of Terence McCool.
A darling of an island. A Garden of Eden.
You better start looking for an Eve.
Oh, no, I want peace and quiet.
Come here.
Where'd you find them?
Under bed, but it need shine.
No want dinero. Want him.
What for?
Anting-anting. Bring good luck.
Well, didn't you tell me
Moros weren't afraid of anything?
You bet your life.
Well, what you want anting-anting for?
Moro no afraid of things he can see, only afraid of things he can't see.
Well, what about bullets?
You can see them.
No see bullets. Bullets...
You no believe in anting-anting?
No.
Then what you got those rats for?
Oh, well, they're to help me find out something I want to know.
Something you no see?
That's it.
Anting-anting.
Hey, Doc! Come here a minute, will you?
Look, Doc. One of Swede's orchids is due for the stalk.
Well, how soon, Larson?
Any day now.
Do you know, I do a lot of this pollinating in my spare time.
Think it'll have to be a cesarean?
Well, it all depends. What kind is it?
It's a Paphiopedilum.
Just a plain Paphiopedilum?
Oh, no, it's a Paphiopedilum fairrieanum.
Oh, that's nothing.
You know, I wanna get a white orchid.
That's why I'm down here.
You gotta go an awful long way before you run across a white orchid.
It's called Cragg.
It fires many bullets at once.
How many they have?
Three hundred.
Bullets?
Enough.
One of these guns worth 20 bulls.
If we get them, you be sultan of Mindanao.
We must get them now.
No, no, Tuan.
They must attack us.
But why they wait?
We kill commander.
Why they not send men?
Perhaps when we send the juramentado to kill the new commander, Manning, they send men.
Oh, Steve!
Aren't you coming down to the landing?
I want you to meet my wife.
Yes, certainly. Go on ahead.
I'll be with you in a few minutes.
Right.
Linda, if you believe in marriage, never say yes to a soldier.
Ever since I've been married,
I've been chasing my husband all over the world.
I haven't seen him this time in over a year.
I know just how you feel.
I haven't seen my father in over four years.
I hope he recognizes me.
Hey. Hey!
Do you got a box there for me?
Larson. L-A-R-S-O-N.
Bill. Bill!
Bill, look, I got a letter from a lawyer in Manila.
I wrote to him just to make quite sure.
And they say they've found the titles to the island.
It doesn't belong to anybody.
I can just move right in.
I don't even have to buy it.
So what I'm going to do...
Hey, Bill, Mac.
Look, my orchid seeds arrived from Battlement Gordon.
Oh, darling.
Oh, George, my ribs!
Oh, bless your ribs.
Bless your heart. Bless you.
As president of the reception committee of the port of Mysang...
Linda!
Pardon me.
Linda, this is the man
I've been telling you about.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
Ladies, may I present
Lieutenants McCool, Canavan, and Larson.
This is Mrs. Manning and Captain Hartley's daughter, Miss Linda Hartley.
- How do you do?
- But, George, where's Captain Hartley?
He should be here now. I just left him.
- Oh, he's right... Will you come with us?
- Yeah!
Yeah, we know, over here.
How long do you expect to stay, Miss Hartley?
As long as my father will let me.
I know I'm going to like it here.
Larson here spends all his time in his horticulture, and the doctor has his hands full of patients and things, but I have nothing to do.
I'd love to show you all the sights.
The public library, the art museum.
And we could swim out 10 miles and see my island.
I'd like to show you my orchids sometime, Miss Hartley.
No, I'm not at all busy with patients.
I only have two. A couple of rats.
One of them's pretty sick.
What's the matter with him?
Dying of a lonely heart, like I am.
Well, here you are, Miss Hartley.
Here's where you live.
Well, thank you.
Thank all of you.
Linda!
Dad!
How did you... When did...
I couldn't believe my eyes.
Didn't you recognize me?
Well, you've changed.
Where are the freckles?
What did you do with the skinny legs and your braids?
You see, if I'd waited any longer,
I'd have been an old woman.
After the earthquake at San Francisco,
I just made up my mind.
You'll never know how much I worried about you.
Even when I knew you were safe,
I wanted to hop the first boat.
And I beat you to it.
Why didn't you write you were coming?
I was too smart. You might have said no.
Oh, you are glad to see me, aren't you?
Glad?
Linda, you're the one person in the world I wanted to see most.
I have the cutest little place fixed up in Manila.
Right near the Luneta.
Oh, darling, could you possibly be as happy as I am?
We're going to have to change our plans a little.
Don't tell me there's been another delay in your leave of absence.
My leave's off.
I'm assigned here indefinitely.
George, it was all arranged.
Sorry, Mabel. Can't be helped.
The C.O. Died, and...
Who?
Colonel Hatch. You never met him.
So, you see, that puts me in command.
Well, it was a mighty nice little house, but I guess we can make this one do.
Oh, George.
Sorry, Mabel.
All the way over
I kept thinking how wonderful it would be to drop in on you like this, as if I'd come from just around the corner.
But, Dad, what happened?
Oh, I got it last year.
But it's all right now.
We'll paint the town red.
We'll have a wonderful time.
The boat stops over for four whole days.
Four days?
Oh, no.
This time you don't get rid of me so easily. I'm here for keeps.
Linda, I'm sorry, but that's impossible just now.
There's nothing I'd like better, but you couldn't have chosen a worse time.
I wouldn't have much time for you, darling.
You'd be alone most of the time.
I've been alone most of the time.
I know.
Manning.
Come on. Buck up, old girl. It's your party.
Sorry, darling.
I was just trying to get used to the idea of going back again without you.
Buy you a drink.
And tonight, just before I came over here, the rat that had been getting polished rice died.
Died of beriberi.
No beriberi on my island.
No rats. No mice.
No doctors.
You should see it as I first saw it, shining in the sun, a pearl set in turquoise.
A pimple in the Pacific.
Excuse me, Miss Hartley.
I'm officer of the day and I won't be able to stay for the dancing, and I thought if you...
I...
Here.
Why, thank you, Lieutenant.
Why, it's lovely.
I've never seen one like this before.
It's a Paphiopedilum fairrieanum.
Oh, no, Bill.
It's a Brassocattleya trufuttiana.
Don't let him scare you. It's just an orchid.
Will you wear it?
I'd love to.
I brought a pin.
Thank you.
I'm breeding a species of my own, a white orchid, and, well, I'd like to name it after you.
Orchidaceae linda.
If you don't mind.
Well, I'd be greatly honored.
Well, thanks, that's...
I gotta go now.
I gotta pollinate.
To us.
Linda. That's Spanish for "beautiful."
Linda. That's what I'll call my island.
Linda Island.
Look.
It's 10 miles off there, with a beach like swan's down when you stretch out on it and gaze up at the powder puff clouds.
And the birds sing, and your heart sings with them.
Then the sea steals up and tickles your toes, which is bad if you're ticklish.
Oh, I see.
How long have you been in the service?
Three years.
I expect to quit next year and hang up my shingle back home.
I'd never quit if I were in the army.
You like the service?
I think it's the most wonderful career in the world.
When I was six, my greatest ambition was to be a top sergeant in my father's company.
Queer ambition for a girl.
I don't see why.
The happiest time of my life was when I was a kid at the presidio.
Most children had to be satisfied with toy soldiers.
But I had real ones.
Most of my male ancestors were soldiers with a remarkable talent for getting killed.
When I was 10, my father bought me a uniform.
I liked it much better than any dress I ever had.
I guess I should have been born a boy.
Oh, no.
My great-grandfather was Wellington's adjutant.
He lost a leg at Waterloo.
My grandfather, he was only a sergeant major, he drowned in his own blood at the Alamo with David Crockett.
- Really?
- My father lies at Chickamauga...
And lies. And lies, and lies, and lies.
Datu, there's something
I'd like you to do for me.
Very glad.
My wife's going back to Manila, and I'd like to give her a little present.
You deal in pearis, and I thought maybe...
I could get you some, but not before the boat leaves.
Oh, that's too bad. I did want to...
There is a lace peddler outside, with shawls and scarves.
He may have something your wife might like.
Oh. Thank you, Datu.
- Go in, Zeruphina.
- Okay.
You better go home and get some rest.
Isn't there anything I can do?
She's all right now.
She'll need some looking after when she comes out of it, though.
I'll hang around.
She was so happy when I met her on the boat.
All she could talk about was him and how she was going to take him back to Manila with her.
She was so frantic to get here, and...
What brought you here?
An earthquake.
The one at San Francisco.
It was ghastly.
Everywhere people were crying out, calling for help.
The living and the dying, all calling for someone.
And suddenly I found myself doing the same thing.
I was calling to my father.
I hadn't seen him for years, he was thousands of miles away, and yet I called to him as if he really could help me.
Funny, wasn't it?
No. No.
People always have to have somebody to call to when they're in trouble.
You find that out when you attend the dying.
If they haven't got somebody, they usually invent somebody.
Even when they're not in trouble, people make up people.
I used to do it when I was a kid, my kid sister and I.
I invented my first patient.
Who was he?
The President of the United States.
Really?
He had a strange new malady.
Nobody knew what it was.
All the specialists in the world couldn't do a thing for him till they sent for me.
I cured him. Just like that.
I guess that's what made me decide on the medical profession.
George!
And from now on,
I want double sentry duty.
Larson, round up every Moro living in the village, take them to the guardhouse. Go on.
Yes, sir.
McCool, I want a stockade built around the fort, and beyond that, barbed wire.
All we've got. Go on.
Yes, sir.
Yabo, instruct the guard.
Nobody's allowed inside without a special pass. Nobody. Go on.
Yes, sir.
Captain, if a Moro can go juramentado, why can't a white man?
There'll be no expeditions, alone or in groups, under any circumstances.
Those are still the orders.
The Moro that killed Captain Manning had this around his neck.
All the Moros wear anting-anting to protect them.
From what?
The Moros aren't afraid of anything, not even death.
I am not afraid of death, either, yet you see I wear an anting-anting, too.
It is a symbol of something you believe in.
And if you believe in something, it's so.
That's true.
Take a look in here.
Those men all believe in something.
Fear.
They're all sick with fear.
Canavan.
I'm not gonna stand for this business of turning your hospital into a refuge for slackers.
There are more men in here than there are on the parade ground drilling.
If it keeps up, they'll all be in.
You're right, Captain, but...
Get them out.
There's nothing the matter with them.
Yes, there is.
That Moro that struck Captain Manning down struck them down, too, but not with a bolo.
They're down with a disease medicine can't cure.
They'll be all right when they learn how to use a gun, when they're properly drilled.
The trouble is that you're trying to drill things into them, when you should be drilling things out of them.
What good's a gun when your finger's so paralyzed with fright that you can't pull a trigger?
Sergeant, get these men out of here.
Have them report for duty.
From now on there'll be no more of this pampering.
All he knows comes out of a book of regulations.
He's so hipped on uniforms, he never stops to consider what's inside of them.
Like trying to talk to a stone wall.
You said yourself it was a disease that medicine can't cure.
Yes. But there must be a cure.
If I only knew the Achilles' heel of the Moro.
What he's afraid of.
There must be something.
There is something.
The Moro is not afraid to die, but he's mortally afraid of being buried in a pigskin.
- Pigskin?
- Yeah.
Ridiculous, isn't it?
But not to the Moro.
He believes it sends him straight to hell.
Father Felipe, you've done it.
You've isolated the germ for me.
The pigskin might be the salvation of Mysang.
I'd rather have the American Army.
Hey, hey, hey, hey. What's going on here?
I got orders to round up all the Moros in the village and put them in the guardhouse.
- Come on.
- No, wait a minute.
All the village Moros are friendly.
Hartley says round them up.
Well, Mike here, he's just a kid.
He was born and raised here.
He's a Moro.
Well, you leave him with me and I'll turn him in.
All right, Bill, but you tell Hartley.
I don't want any part of it.
I won't go to guardhouse.
I'll run away to jungle.
You mustn't do that, Mike.
You'll get into trouble.
No trouble for me in jungle.
You know your way around in the bush?
You bet your life.
Then get a couple of canteens and some rope, and wait for me down at the bridge.
- We go to the jungle?
- Yeah.
You better take your anting-anting.
I've got anting-anting.
Now, you better get going.
What is it?
What is it, Mike?
Spear trap.
Jungle's full of them.
Alipang's gang.
What are they doing?
They're fixing juramentado to run amuck.
Alipang sending juramentado to kill Hartley.
Get the canteens.
Tie him up, Mike.
It was such a pretty little house.
Right near the Luneta.
Linda, if you're ever in love with a man, don't leave him, not for a single second.
Well, I guess that's about all.
You'd better run along now and do your own packing.
I'll see you at the boat.
Linda, you know you haven't packed yet.
Any news of Dr. Canavan?
No.
Linda, don't think
I like shipping you out like this.
What do you suppose happened to him, Dad?
I don't know.
I want you to wire me as soon as you get home.
You can send the telegram to Manila and it will be forwarded to me here.
Aren't you even going to send out a searching party?
What for?
When a man deliberately disobeys an order...
But he's a non-combatant.
Perhaps he didn't realize your order applied to him. The least you can do is...
I've told you I'm not gonna risk any more lives searching for an insubordinate fool!
But he's not. You don't know him, Dad.
Wherever he is, he's doing something for somebody else.
I don't see how you can be so cold-blooded when your best man...
Well, one of your best men.
What makes you so interested in Canavan all of a sudden?
Well, I'm not. I...
I'd feel the same way about anybody.
You'd better finish packing.
You don't want to hold up the boat.
I've just been talking to Yabo.
He says if we ever see the doc again, it'll be in a pit, with his head sticking out covered with honey and some ants crawling around him.
Hey, what are you doing, Mac?
Hey, wait a minute, Mac. You can't do this.
Hartley's given strict orders.
Nobody in their right senses...
Who said I was in my right senses?
I got a touch of the sun.
Wait a minute, Mac.
I got a touch of that sun, too.
Hey, Swede, look.
You, you dimwitted crack, you ought to have been caught and had your head stuffed full of honey
- and put in an ant heap.
- You should have fell in a ditch.
- Where've you been?
- What do you got here?
Genus Homo moro juramentado.
Yabo!
Get that pigskin.
Everybody, come here.
I wanna talk to you.
Come on. Come on in closer.
This is what you were afraid of when the American soldiers went home.
You were sad, and you should have been happy.
Happy because this is your country.
And if it's your country, you've got to protect it.
But you never will as long as you're afraid of men like this.
He thinks you're only fit for slaves, and that's because you act like slaves.
Fear has made you slaves.
Take a look at him.
If we were to cut him open, we'd find he only had one heart, one stomach, approximately 25 feet of intestines.
No more and no less than you have.
Then what makes him a better man?
You!
Because you're afraid of him.
I'll show you what you're afraid of.
Yabo!
All right. Now tell him we're gonna bury him in the pigskin.
Put him in it.

All right, let him go.
Now look at him.
Your brave Moro.
Your terrible warrior who won't let you work your rice fields or fish the seas in peace.
How can you be afraid of that worm crawling on the ground, howling for mercy, begging for help, scared out of his skin because of the skin of a dead pig?
Oh, take a good look at him.
Listen to him muffering.
Is that the man to be afraid of?
- Larson, take this man to the guardhouse.
- Yes, sir.
- Yabo, get these men back to their drilling.
- Yes, sir.
And you, come to my office.
Fall in!
You knew what my orders were about going out in the jungle.
Captain, you ought to frame that pigskin.
Those men have had a shot in the arm, vaccinated against fear, and I think it's gonna work.
We've deliberately avoided making trouble with Alipang until the troops were properly trained.
Well, you fixed that.
Raiding their camp, capturing a prisoner.
You've got them all stirred up.
In all probability, they'll attack.
No, no, that's not their plan.
Their plan is to kill every officer on the post first.
Hatch and Manning were the beginning.
I found that out.
I don't care what you found out.
You've been a meddling fool right from the start, and now you've disobeyed orders.
I'm warning you.
If you step over the line again,
I'll confine you to quarters.
That's all.
That juramentado he captured must have been on his way to kill you.
I imagine Dr. Canavan saved your life.
Yes. I know.
Next time you're gonna play those games in the jungle, why don't you take me with you?
I'm rather good at that sort of thing.
I can start a fire by rubbing two Boy Scouts together, and I can even cross a river in a paper bag when I'm in good form.
I couldn't think of it, Mac.
That would be disobeying orders.
I'll be in in a minute, Mac.
You're leaving today, aren't you?
Well, in case I don't see you...
I was worried for fear I wouldn't get back in time to say goodbye.
We were all worried, for fear you wouldn't get back at all.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Didn't take me that long to say goodbye to her.
"Parting is such sweet sorrow
"That I shall say 'Good Night' till it be morrow."
- Alack, my friend...
- Shut up, you ape.
All packed, Linda?
I'm not going.
Canavan?
I'm afraid I must insist that you take the boat, Linda.
I'm sorry, Father.
I'm staying here.
We must change our plans, Alipang.
They never come to the jungle to fight.
Yes, they will.
They come to jungle.
What's the matter?
Hey, what's the matter?
Hey. What are they talking about?
Oh, they says the water went down two feet in the last hour.
Perhaps there's been a landslide that made the river change its course.
No, it happened too quickly for that.
Maybe it disappeared into a subterranean channel or something.
Captain, I just came back from the hills.
I saw many Moros carry bamboo, rocks.
Alipang, he dammed up the river.
Another trick to lure us out in the jungle.
But it won't work.
- But the river...
- We don't need the river.
The old well, we'll use that.
We'll rig up a still and use seawater.
A man named Cragg invented the repeating rifle and a man named Jenner invented vaccinations.
And if the Philippines ever becomes a nation of its own, who'll get the credit?
Cragg.
But who will it belong to?
Jenner.
The whole post's in an uproar about a few Moros when all around them are billions of enemies, whole regiments of disease, to a few of which you are now more or less immune.
Thank you.
Thank you, too, for saving my father's life.
I heard about it.
Say, what's the matter with your father, anyway? What's he afraid of?
Afraid?
He acts like a little boy who's lost his way home and is scared somebody's gonna find out about it.
Why doesn't he do something about the river, and why doesn't he...
Every time you mention my father, you criticize him.
I'm sorry.
Tenyente Canavan.
When you bring in Moro prisoner, you said this is our country, we must protect it.
Tenyente, we are ready now.
Say that again.
Alipang dry up our river.
The people are frightened.
We don't know what Alipang does next.
We want to fight, Tenyente.
We would rather die than live like this.
We think maybe you speak to Captain Hartley.
Come on!
Captain Hartley, now's your chance.
These boys aren't afraid of Alipang anymore. He's got them fighting mad.
They want to go now and have it out with him.
- Go where?
- Into the jungle, after him.
That's out of the question.
But listen, Captain, if these boys are ever gonna lick Alipang, this is the moment.
We'll lick him by staying right here.
Yabo, take these men back to drilling.
Wait! Look here, Captain...
That's all.
No, that isn't all.
You were sent down here to train these men till they were ready to defend themselves.
Well, they're ready now, and if you can't see that, you're as blind as a bat.
- Canavan.
- What are you waiting for?
If this place is the testing ground, the independence of the Philippines rests with those boys.
Well, they say they're ready to be tested.
What right have you got to stand in their way?
You're forgetting yourself.
They're fighting for existence and nothing's gonna stop them.
And if they let you do it, they're just plain stupid.
Canavan, you're under arrest for insubordination.
Yabo, confine him to his quarters.
Doctor, there are some sick people in the village who need attention.
Tell them to boil their water.
Give them Mag Sulph.
Maybe they need a little drilling.
You better get out and look them over.
I'm confined to quarters.
I've decided to suspend your order of arrest.
And I've decided to remain here during the rest of my stay at Mysang. I'm sorry.
If you persist in this attitude, you will force me to prefer charges against you.
Fine.
I hope you use your influence to have me cashiered.
Save me the bother of resigning.
Doctor!
Dr. Canavan.
He is sick. Very sick.
What is it?
Cholera.
And up into the corners, the walls, the shelves and everything.
Use plenty of carbolic.
No fresh fruit sold in the store.
No coconuts, bananas, mangoes.
Nothing. Understand?
Boil your water. Scald all your dishes.
And don't serve any uncooked food of any kind.
Understand?
And tell the other women.
All food for the patients must be cooked in company kitchens.
- No food shipped in and out of the harbor.
- Yes, sir.
Get some men started digging lime, and post a guard by the well.
- And no water to be taken out of it.
- Yes, sir.
Doctor.
Here's the list of supplies I need.
Cottonseed oil, calamo, all the canned milk you've got in the storehouse.
Buckets, shovels, and add lime and...
Don't you think you could read this better if you held it right-side up?
There's one thing that isn't on that list that we need more than anything else.
Water.
- There's the old well.
- It's no good. It's polluted.
That's what started the cholera.
And it's not only drinking water we need, it's sewage.
The whole village is a mess of pollution.
You've got to send somebody up into the hills to dynamite the dam.
It's sure death to send anybody.
It's sure death here unless we get running water.
It's out of the question.
If we don't get running water in Mysang pretty soon, there won't be any Mysang.
Better get down to the village quick, Doc, they're dropping like flies.
No more water. Put it back.
Dr. Canavan said, anybody who tries to get water here, shoot him.
All right, come on, step it up.
The doc needs the lime. Step it up.
Take everything out of here, that bedding, the mattress, and everything and burn it.
On your way. On your way.
Come on, on your way.
You got to get out of here.
What are you going to do with all these families you're evicting?
Drown them. How do I know what I'm gonna do with them?
I'm sorry. I've gotta figure that out later.
First we've got to clear out all these infected houses.
What are you doing here anyway?
I want to help.
You see that lime over there?
Make a saturated solution, then go from house to house and disinfect the dishes.
Doc, there are some more people for the hospital.
The hospital's full now.
But we can use the clubhouse.
I'll get blankets and prepare for them.
Thank you, Padre.
Doc! They need you over at the hospital.
Hey! Hey! What's going on here?
He throw me in guardhouse,
I no go with him.
Go where?
Captain Hartley's given me orders to dynamite the dam.
I'm taking the squad with me.
We need Mike to show us the way.
I no go!
Mike, I need running water, bad.
You bet your life.
So long, Bill.
- Goodbye, Mac.
- Godspeed.
What orchids I'm gonna bring back.
I hope it won't be lilies.
You're just about as jumpy as the rest of us.
Last night when a man went down to relieve the sentry by the river, the sentry shot at him.
They're so nervous around here, they're shooting at shadows.
- Captain.
- Yes.
Larson should've been back long ago.
Well?
Well, what are you going to do about it?
I can't spare any men.
Suppose there's an attack on the post.
I wish there were. So does everyone else.
Why hasn't it come?
- Why don't we do something?
- McCool!
I'm sorry, sir.
What's wrong with you?
Nothing.
Better see Dr. Canavan. You're not well.
Listen, sir, Larson hasn't got a chance out there, and everyone here is getting so jumpy just sitting around
- waiting for something to happen...
- That's enough, McCool!
Yes, sir.
Here's looking at you, Mac.
Bottoms up.
He's gonna be all right.
I think we caught it in time.
The germ hasn't been found that can stop him.
You better go home and get some rest. You need it.
I'm all right.
You haven't had 40 winks in the last 40 hours.
Neither have you.
You know, I'm beginning to dislike this guy Alipang for the first time.
Why doesn't he come down and fight like a man?
I'm making war with germs instead of bolos.
I don't think the Filipinos are afraid of Alipang now.
They're more afraid of the cholera.
I wonder what happened to Larson?
He couldn't have lost his way, he had Mike with him.
Well,
I'll know a whole lot more about cholera by the time I get home.
Linda?
Have you ever thought about taking up nursing?
What's the matter?
She's all right. She's just been on her feet too long, and fell asleep.
Sit down a minute, will you?
I'm pretty busy.
I know, I want to talk to you.
Have a cigarette.
How's McCool?
Pretty sick.
What are you going to do about Larson?
I don't know.
He never got to the dam.
No.
It's a funny thing about Larson's passion for orchids.
Big, clumsy, sweet.
Still, I have an uncle back home, a blacksmith.
He has tremendous hands.
Can bend a horseshoe with them.
But you ought to see him in the garden with his flowers.
Canavan, I'm going blind.
That bolo cut on the head hit the optical nerve.
It's been getting worse lately.
Why didn't Colonel Hatch order you to the base hospital?
He did. I tore up the medical report when he died.
So I wouldn't see it.
What did the report say?
It recommended retirement, but I had other plans.
Suicide?
What are you talking about?
I know, a report would read,
"Killed in action." Is that it?
That's better than rotting away in an officer's club.
Fact is you're afraid.
Afraid to live. That's much worse than being afraid to die.
Dying is easy. One way of running out.
Running out?
Do you know what failure here means?
Mysang isn't just an isolated village, it's a test.
If we can hold out here, the whole job in the Philippines is done.
Well, I've failed.
I've got to send for the army.
What good would that do?
It'd take days, maybe weeks.
Maybe you can wait that long, but the cholera can't.
What can I do?
Larson's gone,
- McCool's sick, and I'm...
- You're not blind yet!
You're not a failure.
You've just quit.
You're as choked up with fear as those men of yours were.
Afraid of blindness.
Afraid of failure.
Why don't you stop being sorry for yourself and do something?
We don't need the army, we need running water.
Doctor, it is true.
The people all die unless the river runs again.
Many have died already.
Some are Moros, my people.
If you give me men,
I'll lead them myself to the riverhead to break up the dam.
Give me but a score of men with rifles.
I have already sent one expedition.
Until I hear from Lieutenant Larson...
You will not hear from him.
How do you know?
Well, I am told he followed the river.
That was wrong.
The riverhead is guarded by Alipang's men.
But there is another trail.
Mike.
Mike.
What happened to Larson?
Killed...
Everybody...
Ambush.
Captain, soon it'll be too late.
Larson...
Datu...
Datu...
Mike.
It's a good thing you held on to anting-anting.
You bet your life.
Mike, what about the Datu?
You were mumbling about the Datu, Mike.
Mike, try to remember.
Mike, the Datu.
Datu.
Datu.
He with Alipang's men.
Datu killed Larson.
Where's Captain Hartley?
He went to blow out dam.
Did the Datu go with him?
How many men did they take?
Thirty-two.
And the Datu take some Moros.
Moros? What for?
To carry dynamite.
Mac.
Mac.
Mac, listen.
Old Drill 'Em's in trouble.
I've got to go after him.
Mac.
Mac, come out of it, please.
Listen, you're in charge. There's nobody else.
You've got to take over.
- Yeah.
- Understand?
Mac, take care of Linda.
The river bends and turns, we could go straight up.
You see, no ambush, no trouble.
How soon before we get there?
One hour we'll be there.
Datu.
Why are we going up?
Shouldn't we be down in the gully?
We make circle.
Soon we come to the riverhead.
How soon?
Half an hour.
Just a few minutes more, we'll be there.
Canavan?
Why are you bringing the men this way for when you know the river's in that direction?
That way dangerous.
Yes, I know. I just saw Larson, what the ants left of him.
Hang him up.
Tie his hands behind his back.
Yes, sir.
Give me your bayonet.
There's plenty of dynamite left.
He was leading you into an ambush, so it must be close by.
I'm going up to the dam, the river way.
How many men do you want?
None. My friend here, the Datu, knows the way.
He'll make a perfect shield.
You go down to the river and wait for me.
And I'll follow it down and join you.
You're going to take me to the dam.
Come on.
Yabo.
Yes, sir.
Call in the men.
Fall in!
Come on. Keep going.
What's the matter?
Get going!
The river!
The river.
The river's running!
The river!
The river!
The river!
The river! The river is running!
Captain,
I just left Alipang's camp and there's not a Moro left.
You know what that means.
They're probably attacking the village.
We've gotta get back there quickly.
The river.
Yabo!
- Yabo!
- Yes, sir.
Get the men started building rafts.
Yes, sir.
Steve,
I'll take a couple of men and leave on the first raft.
All right.
Pull out the guards!
The Moros are coming!
Sylvia, sound for the alarm!
Linda!
Get the gate shut.
Get those gates shut.
Many guns, many bullets in the fort.
We take them.
Get those closed.
Stand back. Let's go!
Man the walls!
Mac!
Linda, take my temperature.
I'm feeling better already.
Go to village. Get prisoners.
Stick close to the Captain.
He's going to need help.
It's going to be up to you to get the men back to the fort, Yabo.
Yes, sir.
Where they keep guns in the fighting fort?
Where?
Where they keep guns in the fighting fort?
Under church, by the big window.
That side.
You take men.
Attack the gate by the bridge.
I go to other side and get guns.
More shells out of the arsenal!
Mac!
Mac!
Hang on!
Mac.
Get me some more ammunition.
Go on.
Now, we attack on all sides.
You go by river road.
You go by river.
You go by lagoon.
And I go by bridge.
What are you standing there for?
Get back to your places!
Get back into position!
Get back into position there.
Yabo, keep them all together!
Tenyente! They are coming!
They are coming up the river!
Tenyente, they are coming in the lagoon!
Where's the dynamite?
There isn't any.
Keep your positions!
Use your guns as clubs!
Yabo, keep the men together.
Ready!
Aim!
Fire!
Yabo! Yabo!
Alipang! The one in black. Get him!
- Steve.
- Bill.
I wish you could have seen it.
Seen it? I can feel it. It was wonderful.
How's Linda?
Dad!
Thank you.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
We, who are about to live, salute you.
I'd like to make a bonfire of the whole blinking lot of them.
That's all they're good for.
Now, not even that.
They've been shot up so much they ain't worth the blinking petrol to set them afire.
Hold on, my lad. That's the king's property you're talking about.
- I know, sergeant, but look--
- I've looked. So has everybody else.
- What about it?
- Well, what about it?
Don't muck it.
Mend it and shut your mouth.
What about A Flight?
There's the major still stargazing.
That's what about it.
Headquarters, sir.
- Hello. 59th Squadron.
- Hello, Brand?
- Yes, this is Brand.
- What is the delay?
- Has A Flight returned yet?
- No, A Flight is not back yet.
They should be back before no w.
You send them out on a job and expect them back in no time at all.
- What?
- Can you hear me?
- We have a bad connection.
- Yes, yes, yes. I can hear you.
Next time w e'll get someone else.
We can't depend on you.
Oh, you'll get others to do it next time?
That'll be splendid.
- You do not seem to be giving cooperation.
- Yes, sir.
- After all, this is a w ar.
- We've done every job you dig up for us.
If our men can't do it, who can?
They're the finest in France--
If necessary, w e'll transfer you to a less important position.
Perhaps you can be taught to obey orders as they are given.
- Right.
- Is that clear?
Right, sir.
- Here.
- Yes, sir.
- Officious, overdressed brass hat.
- He thinks the 59th can't do it, huh?
The 59th can do anything he can think up.
You know what this place is?
It's a slaughterhouse and I'm the butcher.
No use calling your names, Brand.
- Duty is something you learn--
- Duty?
Do you realize how many men we've lost this last fortnight? Do you?
- Yes.
- Sixteen.
- More than a man a day.
- Yes.
And here's A Flight out on another rotten show.
Seven fine boys. Three of them first time out, first time over the lines.
If half of them get back, we'll be lucky.
It is a rotten job, Brand, but you mustn't let it get you.
They just got to say,
"Bombers after a bridge.
Go up and protect them."
You say, "Fine. Right. Cheerio."
You send up planes that have been shot to pieces, stuck together with spit and glue.
Do our boys argue? Do they complain?
Never. They just say, "Right." And go up.
- And go up and do it.
- They do.
Here they are.
That's one.
Five.
Five out of seven.
That's it.
- Hello, sergeant.
- Sir, you've been in something this time.
- Shrapnel?
- Yes. Nearly blew the ship over.
Yeah, my word-- Look here, sir, not 10 inches from your seat.
I needed that 10 inches, sergeant.
Oh, or every single ship--
- How'd you like it, Scott-o?
- All right. Are you intact?
- Yes, I think so.
- It was a hot one, wasn't it?
- Pretty warm.
- Who did we lose?
Blane and Machen.
Gonna lose Hollister, too, by the look of it.
Don't take it to heart too much, sir.
We all gotta go some time, sir.
- Poor kid. Machen was his best friend.
- Yeah.
Let's go up.
I was telling him we all gotta go.
Sorry, but he went quickly.
He didn't feel any pain.
- Bobby Machen.
- Come on, Court.
Come on.
- A good stiff brandy, Bott.
- Yes, sir.
- Who was it, Blane?
- Blane, yes.
- Machen?
- And Machen. Blane and Machen.
- Here you are, captain.
- Thank you, Bott.
- Have you seen Tim?
- Here a moment ago, sir.
- Mr. Blane and Mr. Machen, sir?
- That's right, Bott.
Too bad, sir.
And the first time over the lines.
Hollister, have a drink, old man?
No, no, I-- I couldn't. Thank you.
What he needs is a cup of tea and a nice lie down.
- A little headache powder--
- Quiet, you.
Just a suggestion.
You'd better come on down and have a drink.
Bobby Machen.
He didn't come back, Court.
He didn't come back.
It couldn't have been Bobs.
It was burning.
- No, it couldn't have been Bobs.
- Steady. Here.
- Drink?
- No, I don't want it.
Come on. Sit down.
Look, get that into you.
You'll feel better.
Come on, bottoms up.
Better?
Look. Poor old Bobby.
Look at the...
You can pack his things later.
They didn't even give him time to unpack.
You're from Harrogate, aren't you?
I used to have an aunt that lived there.
When I was a kid, they used to send me down to stay with her.
She was a funny old dame.
She used to have one of those great, enormous ear trumpets...
- Hollister.
- Oh, where's Courtney?
- He's up there with him.
- Oh, there you are.
The C.O. wants to see you.
He does? Right.
Step into another world and speak of lighter things?
- Very good idea.
- What'll you have?
Oh, the usual.
- Yes?
- We got to the bridge.
The bombers scored a direct hit and wiped it out.
They did?
We lost two men.
Blane and Machen.
Oh, you did?
Yes. That's all.
Wait a minute, Courtney.
You were responsible for those new men.
Yes, that's right.
I was responsible for those two men.
We ran into that Heinie nest on purpose.
We sent the Huns an engraved invitation to come over and meet us.
- Yes?
- We were outnumbered...
...and forced to fly low.
We had to fight our way out.
All right, suppose you did.
You could have been more cautious.
Cautious? You don't think I enjoyed losing those boys, do you?
Getting them burned up, all over France.
Sending them up in crates that should have been on the scrap heap months ago.
That's right. Now, tell me.
Tell me what's on your mind.
That I'm a murderer, I ought to give you better planes, men, fliers.
Say it, why don't you say it?
I'm not blaming anyone, Brand.
Why don't they chuck it?
It isn't funny anymore.
You know what it is? Brand is just about at the end of his tether.
His nerves are frayed out.
It's the responsibility.
Running the show on the ground when he'd infinitely rather be...
...up there in a plane himself, personally taking all the risks.
For a chap of Brand's temperament...
...a dangerous job is much easier than sending other fellows into danger.
He has nothing against Courtney.
He relies on him and he needs him.
- It's a funny war.
- No, not, not awfully.
I say, Courtney, do you remember Griggs in the 37th?
- Yes.
- He was killed the other day near Allensville.
- Pulled the wings off an FE.
- Was he? I hadn't heard.
I'll never forget Griggie's first solo flight.
He pancaked on top of that house...
...found himself upside down, looking into the girl's bedroom.
Yes. And she opened the window, and bashed him on the nose.
You're not gonna play that again, are you?
- It's a beautiful thing.
- It smells.
- Makes me want to cry.
- Yeah, me too.
Who did that?
You do not appreciate good music.
- Hey.
- Hey!
- Furniture, the furniture.
- I've gotta deal with these things--
- I'll take that.
- Please, no.
I told you you'd get hurt.
Now, why don't you sit down.
- Scotty. Scotty.
- Hey. Hey.
Come in.
Here, give it to me.
- Anything more, sir?
- No.
- Is there an E in "courageously," Brand?
- Courageously? Yes, of course.
I'm just sending a letter of sympathy to Mrs. Machen.
I'm puzzled over that word.
It has an unfamiliar look.
Unfamiliar?
Well, you've written it often enough.
Don't you think our letters of sympathy are becoming stereotyped?
I think I'll try and alter my prose style and humanize this one.
Well, no matter how you write it...
...it'll break her heart just the same.
Hooray! Hooray!
"Hurrah for the next man who dies."
Bluffing as though death doesn't mean anything. Trying to live for the moment...
...as if they didn't care a hang about going up tomorrow--
And never coming back.
Because they don't come back...
...do they?
No, but new ones keep coming up.
It goes on and on.
- Hello, yes, 59th.
- Brand?
- This is Brand.
- We have a nice job for you.
A good one this time. I understand.
Starting tomorro w you are to patrol every t w o hours starting at 5, ask Emma.
Wait a minute, sir.
Where do I get the men to do it?
- Are you there?
- Yes? Yes, sir.
- Replacements move up tonight.
- Replacements?
- Oh, they're on their way here now.
- They report before da w n.
- Yes, sir.
- Send the ne w men up.
- Yes.
- They've had enough training.
Have you get that?
Yes, of course, of course, sir.
Of course we'll do it.
If we must, we must.
- The 59th--
- Wait a minute, sir.
- If any of them get back from a job--
- Speak louder. I can't hear you.
If any of them get back from a job like that it'll be a miracle.
- Well, do the best you can.
- Yes, sir. All right.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
A new something nasty, huh?
Four new youngsters are on their way here.
They'll get their baptism in the morning with Courtney, who'll have to take them up.
Strange how a man like that can annoy you and yet...
...keep you worried to death about his safety.
It's not strange. It's the responsibility.
Haven't you seen a mother risk her life to save her child...
...then spanks it soundly for getting itself into danger? Of course you have.
When I order him to take up replacements again, you watch him.
He's going to stand there looking holes clean through me. You watch him.
Then he'll say, "Right." Like that.
- Right.
- Come along, sir. Let's get to it.
One day you'll find my plane--
Turn that thing off, will you, Esmund?
Thanks.
Quiet, lads. Attention there, please.
Orders for tomorrow morning.
A Flight.
Come on, there, hurry up.
Stand to attention.
A Flight on the early show over Baulay Sector.
We're making an advance
5:00 in the morning.
We're to patrol four kilometers behind to the enemy lines.
Strafe enemy reinforcements and munition convoys.
When the barrage starts, B Flight will cover our observation ships and artillery.
You'll take up the details amongst yourselves later on.
That's all. Thank you, gentlemen.
Good night.
Dismissed, gentlemen.
All right, what is it?
A Flight has only got five man.
- More replacements are on their way up.
- More replacements.
Yes. They'll be here first thing in the morning.
You're telling me that I'm expected to go out on a job like that...
- ...with two inexperienced men?
- Those are the orders.
Right.
- What?
- He said "right" just as you said he would.
I'm glad I'm not in A Flight.
Speaking of A Flight, where's Scotty?
He's down here.
Look at that. A couple of drinks and he goes out like a light.
Hey, Scotty, come on.
Time to tucky uppy now, Master Scott.
No sign of life. Wait a minute. Here.
Come along, Master Scott.
Time to tucky uppy.
Rain, rain, go a w ay, come back--
Come on.
- Up you come.
- Good morning, all.
- Say good night to the gentlemen now.
- Good night.
- That's right. Now to these gentlemen.
- Good night.
Good night, gentlemen. Alley-oop.
- Say good night to the gentlemen now.
- Good night.
Way to go, Scotty.
I've never heard of anyone like you.
Couple of drinks and you get as fuzzy as an owl.
You can't even keep your eyes open.
A couple of drinks?
Maybe four, maybe eight.
Who knows? Who cares? Who--?
Oh, here are my piebald pajamas.
I will now discard the lower half as usual.
I have spots in front of my eyes, Court.
- Well, what do you expect?
- Oh, these?
These were a going-away present from a little froufrou.
- Who, who?
- Froufrou.
Froufrou, froufrou. Froufrou was sweet.
What's the matter with you?
You're moping about something.
Oh, No. No, I was just thinking of Hollister.
It's pretty rough losing your best friend, isn't it?
- And he's gone.
- Go on, go to bed.
Machen, he was just a baby.
Couldn't have been older than that brother of yours.
Oh, little Donnie.
Oh, I hope this war is over by the time he gets out of school.
I haven't seen him in so long...
...I probably won't even recognize him when I do see him.
Court, I've got awful opening and shutting trouble with my head. Awful.
All that seems pretty far away, doesn't it?
Home and all that sort of thing.
My head seems awfully far away.
Imagine being at home now, peaceful and quiet.
Nothing to worry about.
Nothing to do except get up in the morning and laze around.
Marvelous.
Be able to know that you'll come back to your own bed at night.
- I'm sorry, sir.
- What's the time, sergeant?
Nearly 5:00, sir.
Dawn's just coming up.
- How's the weather?
- A bit cloudy, sir.
Where's that honey you're always talking about?
Honey you could have had right on this table.
Could I get anyone to help with them bees?
Up they'll go with their lives in their hands...
...but will one of them face a bee? No.
- It's a phenomena, sir. Phenomena.
- You're very good with the chicken.
How is it you could do nothing with bees?
I put a sack over me head as Mr. Scott recommended...
- ...and out I goes to be friendly--
- Scotty!
Out I goes to be friendly like,
I start buzzing back to them, like:
- How?
- Morning, Mr. Scott.
- Oh, good morning, sergeant.
- Good morning--
Oh, good morning, Mr. Scott.
It's a beautiful morning, Mr. Scott.
- Have an egg, Mr. Scott.
- Off from the nest, sir.
Coffee, Mr. Scott?
Don't stand there gaping.
Bring a couple of headache powders on toast. Mr. Scott, a little coffee.
What's that singing outside?
Replacements coming up, sir.
- Send them in.
- Very good, sir.
Court, have you ever seen mice on roller skates?
On bicycles, never on skates, old man.
- Morning, gentlemen.
- Good morning, sergeant.
Right this way, please, gentlemen.
That's all right. We'll look after your luggage. Just follow me.
- This way, gentlemen, please.
- Here they are.
Will you wait here, please, gentlemen?
- The replacements, sir.
- They get younger every day.
If this goes on much longer, they'll be coming in perambulators.
Come on, fix them up.
Gentlemen, Captain Courtney.
- Good morning, gents.
- Good morning, sir.
Russell, second lieutenant, sir, reporting from the pool for duty.
I see. How do you do, Russell?
Nice to have you with us.
- At ease. We don't have any formality.
- Thank you, sir.
- What's your name?
- Burt, sir.
Burt, eh? Burt what?
- Henry Burt.
- Oh, I see. How do you do?
- And you?
- Cleaver, sir.
Hello, Cleaver.
- And what's your name?
- Smythe, sir.
Hello, Smythe. Nice to have you with us.
- How many hours have you fellows had?
- I've had 18, sir.
Eighteen. And you?
- Thirteen, sir.
- Fifteen, sir.
- And how many have you had?
- Seven and a half, sir.
Seven and a half, eh?
I'll take Russell and Cleaver.
Get your things on.
- We're going to strafe trenches.
- Now, sir?
- You won't have time for breakfast.
- We've had it, sir.
- When do we go, sir?
- You'll go soon enough. Get some coffee.
- Morning, Hollister.
- Morning.
- Breakfast waiting for you, sir.
- I don't want breakfast.
- I think you better have some breakfast.
- I don't want any breakfast, thank you.
Have some coffee or breakfast or drinks or something.
- Kirby, bring some cups.
- Coming.
- Bott. The usual.
- Coming, sir.
Thank you.
Hollister, have a little breakfast.
- I'm just giving a little nourishment.
- I see.
I should explain that this little spotted number on my left...
...goes under the name of Scotty.
He's in A Flight.
- First today.
- Nice fellow, but he drinks too much.
Have some of this.
Come on, old chap.
Good luck.
Scotty.
Come on, now.
What are you doing asleep?
Come on, wake up.
Will you come or must I--?
- No, wait. Hold on.
- Come on. Come on then. Quick.
They can wait for me.
Go.
- There you are, sergeant.
- Yes, sir.
Russell and Cleaver will take four and five.
- This way.
- Don't forget to stick to my tail. Good luck.
You. You're an old hand now.
We're counting on you.
- Right, sir.
- Better watch him.
- Don't forget, you're protecting the tail.
- Yeah.
And watch yourself too, old man.
I don't want be left holding the bottle.
Thank you.
Is everything all right, Mac?
- Everything's all right, sir.
- Fine.
- Switch off.
- All right. Spin it.
Has the officer got any papers that might give information to the enemy?
No.
Has the officer got any papers that might give information to the enemy?
No.
Beat us to it just by a few more flying hours.
Lucky devils.
"And mother and I talk about how much you would love the old rock path now.
Last Sunday's rain brought up the best primroses."
Primroses.
"Jenny's had seven darling puppies."
Well, well, the rain seems to be accomplishing many blessings.
Think of it, Brand, a litter of seven.
"We'll have to give most of them away...
...because the milk rationing is very strict now...
...and we won't be able to buy enough for them."
Buy enough. Well, that's strange.
I always thought puppies were provided with private rations by their mother.
Even England's getting muddled with this war.
It'd be awfully nice if we had a dog around here in the mornings...
...to come in and cheer us up.
Here.
Come on, fella. Come on here.
Mind your muddy feet. Come on.
- What you doing?
- The dog.
Dog? What dog? Where?
No, I say it would be nice if we had a dog to come in here in the mornings...
...to sort of cheer us up, you know?
I thought it would be sort of cozy, you know?
Not Mr. Scott, sir?
There were two Boches after me.
Scotty was trying to help me.
Yes, Courtney?
We fought off the counterattack for an hour...
...and they found us.
We lost three men. Russell...
...Cleaver, Scott.
I'm sorry about Mr. Scott, sir.
Yes.
To him.
I'll drink to that.
To Scott-o.
Sleep tight.
What happened, Courtney?
Well...
We were strafing that convoy right after the first barrage...
...trying to get out under a cloud bank.
The Jerries came down on us like that:
Poor little Cleaver went first.
I don't think he even fired a shot.
Then Russell must have gone at about the same time. I didn't see.
Then Hollister.
Well?
- Something must have happened.
- He funked?
Yes, he did a bit. He got in a jam...
What?
And Scott-o went after him, to help him out.
Jerry got on his tail and shot him down out of patrol.
You sure?
Yes, I saw it.
It was right underneath me.
There was nothing I could do.
He had his tail surfaces all shot away.
He caught in a spin.
As he went down, he waved goodbye.
Where'd he'd go down?
I don't know, somewhere behind our lines.
I went after that Jerry bullheaded.
- Did you get him?
- No, I put a bullet in his motor.
He came down behind our lines somewhere.
Behind our lines?
Hi there, fellas. Turn that off, please.
No, no. Play it. Go ahead. Play it.
What's it matter?
You fellas don't appreciate good music.
Play it.
Maybe Scotty will hear it.
Funny if you really thought he could, wouldn't it?
He was wearing those bright piebald pajamas.
Remember, the one's with the spots?
It'll be funny if he shows up before the devil in those.
- Right, bring him in.
- Great fellow, Scotty.
You may send the car back.
Just wait here a moment, Henderson.
- What's all this?
- Pardon me, sir.
An artillery car brought in a German.
One moment, Captain Henderson.
- Who brought him down?
- They say the leader of A Flight.
That's you, Captain Courtney.
Steady, old fellow.
- Good morning, sir. I have my prisoner here.
- Good morning.
Hauptmann Von Mueller.
Hauptmann Von Mueller, Major Brand.
And Captain Courtney.
Phipps, tell him Courtney is the man that brought him down.
He says he's delighted to meet you.
Oh, sorry.
- So sorry?
- Sorry. Yeah. Will you have a drink?
Yes? Come on.
Bott, drinks.
What will you have, whiskey, cognac, champagne?
- Nothing but the best.
- Cognac.
- Cognac.
- Cognac.
Hello, Hollister. Have a drink.
- This is Hollister, Captain Von--
- Von Mueller.
Sorry.
- Sorry.
- We are sorry.
So...
He wants us drink to the day they'll blow us out of the skies.
0h, no, no, no. Can't do that.
Ask him if he'll drink a toast to the dead.
To the dead.
- That's very nice.
- Sorry.
No, no.
Thank you very much indeed.
Very nice. Thank you.
Do you think you could manage to say "the" next man "that" dies...
...not "zee" next man "zat" dies?
- The.
- The. That's it.
Very nice.
Very good.
You can laugh, joke with him, a man who murdered your best friend!
- He's dead! You know that, don't you?
- Shut up!
So is Blane. And Machen, my best friend!
They're dead!
They aren't coming back.
They aren't coming back anymore.
Shut up.
I believe you've forgotten Scott-o already.
Brandy, Bott.
He wants to know if Hollister flies.
Tell him yes.
Off the handle more times than not.
Brandy, Bott!
"Pack Up Your Troubles."
Scotty!
Scotty!
Where did--?
Where did you get the champagne?
I don't know.
You-- You--
You know, we thought you'd gone west.
Tell us, what happened?
Well, the last thing I remember was pancaking into a trench...
...and seeing my wings fold up.
Then I woke up with a bump on my head--
Feel it?
And a stretcher bearer pouring rum down my--
- You should have that rum.
- You didn't have any, did you?
Just a couple of drops.
I stopped on the way back...
...and I brought these.
Come on, open them up! Open them up!
Oh, what's that?
Oh, that's the man that brought you down.
- Who?
- Introduce him, will you, Phipps?
- What does he say?
- I don't know.
He wants him to have a drink.
Oh, drink! Drink. Bott, drinks!
Oh! Don't waste it!
- Didn't understand a word. Did you?
- I took German in school, but--
So did I, but I can't understand the way these foreigners speak it.
Thanks, old man.
Sir, there's a driver out here named Flaherty.
- He's waiting for you, sir.
- Tell him to wait.
- I've got a car and chauffeur outside.
- What?
Gonna take me on a personally conducted tour...
...of all the inns and taverns of France.
Wonderful. You wanna come, Fritzie?
Gentlemen, keep the war going, please.
We are going out to roll in a few gutters.
Bravo.
Flaherty! Flaherty, where's my horse?
Bring it on.
Boys, get comfy.
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Courtney! He can't go, he's a prisoner.
Oh, but he can sing.
Oh, well, goodbye, Fritzie. Goodbye.
Come on, Court, get in.
This is Mr. Courtney, Mr. Flaherty.
He's the best singer--
Best driver on the Western front.
- Coming up. Coming up.
- Get the captain to sing.
Oh, he's terrific.
- Bring him in. I want to talk to him.
- Yes, sir. Come.
Road hog!
I'm not disputing that.
Military police are for that purpose. What?
- You should put them under arrest.
- I do not think it's a good idea.
- Why not?
- Why?
Well, because I need them here, that's why.
- What? They did?
- Some girl brought a minister do w n here.
- She did?
- Wants to marry both of them.
The Frenchman? His sweetheart?
Put him do w n in a w ell.
- Oh, they did?
- They're on their w ay back.
Oh, they are? Why didn't you say so before?
I'll discipline them.
All right, thank you, Yes. Goodbye.
Drunk as lords and raising Cain, and you laugh, you old fool.
Well, really, you know, confidentially, Brand, I envy them.
Don't you? Now, tell the truth.
Apparently, they've put some French girl's sweetheart down a well or something.
If I didn't need them here,
I'd leave them to the military--
Wait a minute, there's B Flight.
More trouble. Come along.
This way, sir. Come along, sir.
- Squires, what happened?
- Von Richter has moved in across the lines.
- Von Richter?
- We ran into one flight and then another.
There was nothing we could do.
Suddenly, the air was full of them.
It is lucky to any of us got back.
They can really fly.
Many of them?
We were outnumbered four to one.
We didn't have a chance.
- Here. Now, take it easy.
- Yes, sir.
That's right. Get your tourniquet on there.
- What's wrong?
- Hello, Squires.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- How many men did you lose?
- Courtney, Von Richter's over there.
That's gonna make things lively as if it wasn't bad enough already.
- Who'd you lose, Squires?
- Well, Thornley and Murrell.
- Verdan and Hollister.
- Hollister?
- Four out of seven.
- Hollister. How did Hollister go?
- He was trying to help Thornley.
- He was?
- Yeah.
- I'm glad. Out like a man.
Get Captain Squires to the medical officer.
- Courtney, you'd better come with me.
- Can you get the m.o.? All right.
- Duck, cover!
- Enemy plane.
Stay where you are, sir.
- Look, Courtney, boots.
- Wait. Don't touch those.
- They're all right. Let's look at them.
- They're all right.
What's that?
"One pair of trench boots for the use of British flying officers.
You'll be safer on the ground.
Von Richter."
Give me those boots.
Give me those. I'll get that--
- I'll take care of these boots.
- Order.
Give me those boots, Courtney.
Now pay attention.
There are going to be no volunteer patrols.
Don't you realize these boots are a trick to get you up in the air?
None of you is going to commit suicide by going up alone.
Don't worry. You'll die soon enough.
But not a man leaves the ground without my orders. Understand?
- Yes, sir.
- Come along, Phipps.
Yes, sir.
About those boots, Court...
Yes, I was just thinking the same thing.
You can keep the boots. They don't fit.
Let her rip, Scott-o.
Oh, I can't see.
I can't see.
We're in a right-hand spin. Pull her out.
But I can't see.
That's it. Right forward. Left.
We're over our own lines, aren't we?
Yes, but the ground's just as hard here.
Look out. Here it comes.
Court, get me down.
Hello. Are you all right?
I'm fighting the wrong way.
Wait a minute. Look out for the petrol.
- Right.
- Right. Easy now, sir.
- Give me something, I can't see.
- Here you are.
Here's your scarf.
Well, we made it. We made it.
Mine is a farce.
They command themselves.
- Orders don't mean anything. It's a circus.
- Remember--
I remember giving orders.
Give me my tunic.
- Yes, sir.
- Those orders have been disobeyed.
With Infantry or other branch, an officer can keep discipline. What can I do?
All right, thank you.
They're laughing up their sleeves.
- Or dead.
- Yes, or dead.
No, they're not dead.
Courtney! Scott!
- All right, you can go.
- Thank you, sir.
Good morning, gentlemen.
- Good morning, Phipps.
- Good morning, Phipps.
What do you fellows imagine
I'm here for?
To watch you turn the army into a circus?
I've played fair, but this is organized warfare not your own private feud.
You went out against Von Richter outnumbered four to one.
You fools, when we need every man and every plane.
I'm not gonna stand for it any longer.
I've made out a report on the situation for headquarters.
- Fifty-ninth.
- There'll be a court-martial.
Somebody's going to get hurt.
Give it to me.
All right, stand at ease.
- Hello. Hello.
- Brand?
- This is Brand.
- Congratulations.
- What?
- Splendid job.
The drome was bombed?
What drome? Where?
We've learned your squadron ble w the air base off the map. Nice w ork.
- Here-- Wait. Excuse me.
- Splendid job of bombing the airdrome.
- Destroyed it?
- Yes, a perfect job.
- Really?
- Ble w the w hole place up.
Yes, sir. Yes, yes.
From here, yes they did.
- Did you send both flights?
- Only two of them.
- Only t w o ships? That's splendid.
- What?
General Barranger has ordered your immediate transfer to Wing. Are you there?
Excuse me, excuse me, sir.
Would you mind repeating that again, sir?
Has ordered your immediate transfer to Wing.
- Yes, sir.
- Appoint someone in your place.
With pleasure. Right away, sir.
We w ant more of this sort of thing.
We'll see that you are transferred to a more important position.
- Is that clear?
- Thank you, sir, thank you.
Come on, fellas, come into my parlor.
- Oh, get me another glass, will you, Phipps?
- Yes, sir.
- Here, you are, Phipps. Courtney. Scott.
- Thank you.
- Thanks.
- And myself.
And now I've got you, Courtney.
I've got you where I want you.
So far, the war has been a personal adventure for you.
Full of... and glory.
As an individual flier, you've been admirable.
And you've evaded responsibility with equally supreme skill.
Disobeyed orders, blamed me, accused me of putting kids into canvas coffins.
Well, listen to this, my lad.
Headquarters liked your raid this morning.
They liked it so well that they've appointed me up to Wing.
Excuse me, Phipps.
And before I go, I'm ordered to appoint someone in my place.
- Here at my place at this little desk.
- What do you mean?
I mean that that someone is going to be you.
See how you like it,
Mr. Squadron Commander Courtney.
Right.
- Goodbye, Phipps. I'll be writing to you.
- Goodbye, sir.
- Hello, 59th. Hold on.
- 59th?
- Hello. Yes?
- Hello, 59th. Hello.
Let me speak w ith the commanding officer.
It's for the commanding officer.
That's you, Captain Courtney.
- Hello?
- Speak louder.
- I can't hear you.
- Hello.
At da w n tomorro w,
put both flights into the air.
- What is it?
- That's his third bottle going in.
He won't listen to me.
- Let the infantry get demoralized.
- We can't.
No. I can't put planes over them, because
I haven't got anybody left to fly them.
- You have no man left to fly them?
- No. Replacements?
- Six of them, poor kids.
- Never mind that.
Von Richter's shot us out of the air.
He's killed all our best men.
- What do you expect us to do?
- Green kids can't stop him.
- They've had enough training.
- He'll shoot them down.
You have your orders.
No w see that you follo w them out.
Yes.
All right, it'll be done, but I tell you they haven't got a chance on earth.
Brass hats, sitting up there in easy chairs.
- Trying to make excuses--
- Third of the bottle down the hatch.
- You'll have geese on your desk--
- All right, what?
- I'm sorry.
- Wait a minute. I'm sorry, old chap.
Scott-o, that's bad, isn't it?
I'm as jumpy as the dickens.
Oh, I get like that too.
You know, I can't get used to being up there in front of that flight all alone.
- I miss you up there.
- Do you? I miss it too.
- This is a rotten job.
- Well, somebody's got to do it.
But why me?
I'm supposed to be a flier, I think.
None better, my boy.
I heard a good story from one of the mechanics just now.
- Two fishermen went out, three fisher--
- Not now, old chap. Do you mind?
I've been talking to headquarters.
We've got a rotten job ahead of us now.
Do you remember Brand used to call himself the executioner?
Poor Brand. He was nearly half-witty when he left this place.
Yes. I'm beginning to understand a lot about him.
He's probably in Paris with a bottle in one hand and a blond in the other--
Replacements.
More lambs for the slaughter.
Fix them up.
- Make them as comfortable as you can.
- I will.
Oh, they're really young this time.
How many hours have you actually had?
Hours? Nine to be precise.
That was at Hendon, of course.
I got my wings on a Longhorn.
Finished off in a good old Avro all the way out.
An FE for me, though, any day.
- Donnie.
- Scotty.
- Where did you come from?
- Oh, Hendon.
Gents, this is my brother, Captain Scott.
- I thought you were in school.
- Not much. I had to get in this.
I went through ground-school in precisely four weeks and two days.
- You did, huh?
- Yes.
- Well, aren't you glad to see me?
- Yes. Of course I am.
- This is my baby brother.
- How do you do, sir?
- How do you do, sergeant?
- Come on inside.
Attention.
I'm the skipper of A Flight.
Lieutenant Billings, sir, reporting from the pool for duty.
Stand at ease, gentlemen.
There's no formality here.
Billings.
- Will you take care of these officers for me?
- Yes, sir.
- You've got a bar in here and everything.
- I suppose you drink now, do you?
I did have a couple coming over on the boat. It made me sick.
- Good.
- I could try one with you.
No.
- Now, look here, Scotty.
- Or what?
Hold down on this baby stuff.
You're the big lad of the family...
...but I'm in this with you now, officer-and-gentlemen stuff.
- How many hours have you had?
- Nine.
Nine.
Oh, now, listen, Scotty. I went through combat maneuvers without a hitch.
You should have seen me.
I'm sure you did, Donnie. I'll show you your room. You can share mine with me.
That's great. By the way, isn't Court in command here?
- Yes.
- Well, can't we go and see him?
You'll see him soon enough. Come on.
Come on, old chap. Ready for orders?
Come on.
Attention.
Turn that thing off, will you, Aimes?
- Attention, men.
- Quiet, lads. Line up, please.
Orders for tomorrow morning.
Good evening, gentlemen.
There's no secrecy about these orders.
GHQ has discovered that Fritz is making a big push the day after tomorrow.
They've started minor advances already.
You're to patrol the Mantez Woods Sector.
That's opposite the German 6th army.
You'll fly four patrols a day...
...which means that every man will be in the air at dawn.
As usual, you've got the dirty work to do, low flying, machine gunning infantry...
...strafing supply trucks and any shock troops they try to bring up.
You're flying directly below Von Richter's patrols, so you better watch out.
- That's all.
- Court?
- Oh, may I say hello, sir?
- Donnie.
- Donnie Scott. Where did you spring from?
- Hendon.
Hendon?
You're...
- You're one of the replacements?
- Yes. I go up tomorrow, don't I?
Yes, you do.
Court, you're not sending him up on patrol tomorrow. You can't do that.
Every man goes up tomorrow, Scott-o.
If you think I'm taking him up, you're crazy.
- Oh, but, listen, Scotty, I'm an excellent--
- Oh, shut up.
He's not going up.
- Be ready at dawn tomorrow.
- Yes, sir.
Now, look here, Scotty--
You wait here.
And you're the one that gapped to Brand about sending green kids up to get killed.
Combat maneuvers. Ground-school.
He doesn't know.
What chance would he have up there?
He'll have as much chance as the others.
There can't be any exceptions.
Do you think I want to do this?
Those are the orders.
Oh, I know it's orders, Court.
Give me three days, two days.
Then I can get him up in the air...
...and teach him a few basic tricks.
At least he'll have a fighting chance.
He doesn't know anything.
Court, he can't even do a half-loop and roll out.
Do you hear that? He can't even roll out.
What good's he gonna be up there?
Do you think he's gonna bring down any Boche plane? No.
They'll slaughter him, Court.
Give me just a few days.
I said every man goes into the air at dawn.
- I'm sorry, Scott-o, but there it is.
- I won't take him up.
- Those are the orders.
- I don't care. I won't do it.
Those are the orders! Now, get out!
Get out.
Right.
- Headquarters.
- Hello, headquarters.
- Are you there?
- Yes.
This is 59th Squadron.
I want to talk to General Barranger.
- Is it urgent?
- Yes, it's very urgent.
Right.
- Hello, hello.
- Hello, yes? Yes, sir, Courtney.
I wouldn't have bothered, but we've got an impossible situation.
- Didn't your replacements reach you?
- The replacements? Yes, they arrived.
- They're kids.
- They've had training.
They'll be no earthly use against Von Richter.
They haven't even the first idea of combat tactics. Green kids.
- We sent the best men w e have.
- Yes, I know, sir.
- But this job's--
- It's the best w e can do.
- What do you expect us to do?
- Yes, sir.
- May I go on?
- Well?
If I could have a week with them, a few days to teach them some things.
Show them a few tricks so they'll be of use before they get killed--
Don't bother me again about this.
Do as you're told. Goodbye.
I know it's against the rules and regulations to burst into your sanctum sanctorum...
...but could I have just one word with you, please, Court?
Of course you could, Donnie.
- Good old Court.
- I'm glad you came. What is it?
Well, I wish Scott-o and you wouldn't scrap about me like this.
Honestly, I'm an excellent flier.
I've had combat maneuvers--
Combat maneuvers, have you?
Now, don't you laugh too.
Scotty lost his head completely.
- Oh, we all do here sometimes.
- Yes, of course.
Your nerves get jumpy.
A lot of fellas bunched together.
Scotty's responsible for the other fliers.
When he sees me fly, he won't worry then.
It's not just a question of flying. You see, you're gonna be up against veterans.
Fliers like Von Richter.
Are you trying to say that, that you think I won't get back tomorrow?
No, no. There's nothing so terribly difficult about combat flying...
...except remember that Scotty and those fellows have had experience.
They're old hands.
You can't afford to be too careless or overconfident at first.
It's rather like a game at school. You gotta be on your toes, watch everything.
Never forget anything you learn.
- You won't have any trouble.
- I'm glad to hear you say that.
It's true.
When you go out tomorrow, you stick close to Scotty.
Watch everything he does.
See the way he handles his ship.
- He is a fine flier, isn't he, Court?
- The best.
- Do you smoke?
- Yes, sir.
Oh, thanks, Court.
You know, I liked your comparison about this and a game at school.
Did you? That's just about what it is.
Great, big, noisy, rather stupid game that doesn't make any sense at all.
None of us know what it's all about or why.
Here we are, going at it hammer and tongs.
I bet you those fellows there feel exactly the same way about the enemy.
Possibly.
Then one day I suppose it'll all end as suddenly as it began. We'll go home...
...till some other bunch of criminal idiots sitting around a large table...
...shoves us into another war, then we'll go at it again.
Do you remember my father? He used to be a professor of biology at Queens.
He always used to say:
"Man is a savage animal who, periodically, to relieve his nervous tension...
...tries to destroy himself."
That's just about what it is, Donnie.
I see.
- Good night, Donnie.
- Good night, Court.
- Sleep tight.
- Thanks.
Oh, I--
I suppose it is just possible that one might not get back.
It has been known, hasn't it?
Well, in that case, I...
Would you mind if I left this with you?
What is it?
Oh, it's something I got on the crew last year.
It's silly, but, well, it's rather important to me.
Good night.
There's Mantez and the 6th German army.
- Right under Von Richter's patrol.
- Where's Von Richter?
Gentlemen, Major Courtney.
Good morning.
I wanted to wish you good luck.
Sorry I didn't have any chance to meet you last night.
- Best of luck. Same to you.
- Thank you.
- And you.
- Thank you, sir.
- Good luck.
- Thank you, sir.
- Is Captain Scott down yet?
- On his way, excuse me.
Gentlemen, these are your planes:
Mr. Moorehead, Number 6.
- Mr. Rutherford, Number 5.
- They're game lads, aren't they?
- Young England.
- Yes.
This is Number 3, Number 4 on the end.
Hello, Court.
- Good luck.
- Thanks.
Now, remember, stick close and I'll get you through.
Don't worry about me, Scott-o.
I'm fine, couldn't be better.
- Switch off.
- Switch off.
- Contact.
- Contact.
Switch off.
- Switch off.
- Contact.
Contact.
Donnie!
Donnie!
- Two planes back.
- I know.
- Who?
- Scott-o, Billings.
You got what you wanted.
He's gone, just as I knew he would.
I watched him burning.
You killed him.
I didn't kill him.
You sent him up, you dirty butcher.
All right, gentlemen.
What a rotten war.
Come on, Ronald, say good morning.
Say good morning.
There you are, sir. There you are.
Personality, that's what you said.
Personality.
- Hello, Brand.
- Hello, Phipps.
- You look like a new man.
- I never felt better in my life.
- Have you missed me?
- Well, yes, sir.
Hello, sergeant.
How are the chickens?
- Top old eggs, sir.
- How's Courtney?
- Oh, he's inside.
- Go on, driver. Hop on behind.
Hello, Brand.
Hello, Courtney. How are you?
- You're looking fine.
- I couldn't feel better.
- Same old place, eh?
- Same old place.
- Well, how are you, old boy?
- Wonderful.
What?
I was wondering if you could stop playing with that.
Oh, I'm sorry. Nerves, I know.
I say, Courtney, do you remember those Gyppie cork tips...
...that you used to scream about?
I found a tin of them in the mess.
- You mean you brought these along for me?
- Yeah.
Well, thanks very much.
- Have a drink or something.
- Oh, thanks.
- Glass behind you.
- One for you?
- Yes, thanks.
- Hey, where's Scotty?
I don't know.
How is he?
He's all right, I think.
Scotty and I haven't talked to each other for about two weeks.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Courtney, I hear headquarters have been giving you a rotten time lately.
The old man says you've been kicking up the very devil.
Is he? Well, you ought to know, you're up there.
Come on, Brand, come on. What is it?
Too important to telephone about.
- That's insane. You know that, don't you?
- Yes.
The enemy are making their biggest push the day after tomorrow.
They've concentrated the munitions at the Soulet railhead.
You destroy that railhead, you'll stop their drives.
But, Brand, you're crazy.
Soulet is 60 kilometers behind the enemy lines.
The German air force would be on our tails before we were halfway.
- The flight couldn't make it.
- One plane could.
- What do you mean, one plane?
- One plane. One man. At dusk.
It's up to one man to go alone...
...to take a chance at getting through before they can stop him.
Do you think I could ask a man to do that?
He'd be dead before he started.
What can you do? You can't refuse.
No. I'll go myself.
I'm afraid you can't do that.
I know exactly how you feel.
I had it myself for months.
Here at this desk, chained to it.
You'll have to ask for a volunteer.
The instructions are all here.
All right.
Attention, gentlemen.
Stay where you are, gentlemen.
I have a job for you.
This just came in from Wing, gentlemen:
"Enemy in the 22nd and 23rd sectors plan major offensive...
...on the entire front
19th instant at ack-emma.
Munitions for the advance concentrated in a dump at railhead at Soulet."
Our squadron's ordered to destroy it.
Soulet's 60 kilometers behind the German lines.
There's no chance for a flight to get through.
But one man, flying low, hedgehopping, might possibly succeed.
- Chances are 10-to-1 he won't come back.
- I'll go.
- I'd like a volunteer.
- I spoke first. Do I get that job?
Is it mine?
Right.
Here are your instructions.
You leave at dusk.
You've got about two hours.
Right.
Tell Sergeant Watkins to get my plane ready.
- Get that out by the first post, Kirby.
- Yes, sir.
Here's this razor you like so much.
You take that.
- For me, sir?
- For you, sir.
I couldn't, sir. You'll be wanting it when you come back from the flight.
Tomorrow morning, you'll be yelling,
"Kirby!
How'd you think I can shave without me razor?"
No, Kirby. From now on,
I'm going to grow a long beard.
Take this.
Make you smell like a geranium.
Very good, sir, if you insist.
Shirts, socks.
Here, take the whole lot, Kirby.
- Come in.
- Oh, don't say that, sir.
I've been going over this and I've found a route that'll give you a better chance.
Don't bother.
I don't want to hear anything from you.
I'm in command here and you'll listen to what I have to say.
I want that plane back, you understand?
We need them all.
- I want you back.
- Back.
Yes, back.
- Bring some chairs, Kirby.
- Yes, sir.
Thank you. All right, that's all.
I've been in touch with Intelligence and they've given me some--
- No, thank you.
- No?
They've given me some rather interesting information about this section here.
It seems that for a quarter of a mile, there's hardly anti-aircraft.
That'd be a very good place to cross.
Go north then fly low into the entrance of the Luonne Valley.
Fly low--
Thanks.
I say you fly low into the entrance of Luonne Valley.
As you know, there's no activity there, either.
The hills will hide you until you're through it.
And then you go north.
Hit the railway here.
Then east following the tracks right into Soulet.
Around here, all the big ammunition dumps. They're all grouped together.
A hit anywhere in that vicinity will set the whole thing off.
The enemy high patrol gets back at dusk...
...so you'll have to fly low to avoid them.
Your only chance is to get there before they spot you.
That's amazing.
From that point on, the place is alive with archies.
They'll phone ahead and you'll probably run into some barrages...
...but you'll just have to keep on going...
...and that's all.
Yes, that is undoubtedly all.
- I've a suggestion to make.
- What's that?
You've got an hour and a half.
Why don't you lie down and have a sleep.
It'll do you good, freshen you up.
Get on your toes.
No, I couldn't sleep.
No? Well, how about one for the road?
No, I had two already.
This stuff works too quickly on me.
- Oh, come on. One more won't hurt you.
- No, thank-- Well...
To the job.
I'll drink to that.
- To the job.
- Right.
- You're a funny bird.
- Really?
I found myself very amusing lately.
You know, I've never seen one of those big munition dumps hit the ceiling.
When it does, you'll probably hear it back here. If you do, you can think of me.
Right. I'll think.
Court?
It's all the war, isn't it?
Donnie going and the old brass hats.
- A Flight, B Flight.
- Orders.
Drinks, friends.
I shouldn't go up there bad friends with anybody, should I?
Be a good idea if you didn't.
What I mean is especially with you.
It has been a long time, hasn't it?
London, home, and all that.
- We've had some fun, though, haven't we?
- Yes. Pretty good times.
I've missed you, especially when I'd had a few beakers.
Nobody to take care of the corpse.
Good old Scotty blotto again, you know.
- You never did now when to stop anyway.
- Oh, it's no fun if you stop.
Cheers.
You ever forget that awful night at Carsnips when I fell over with my head in the soup...
...and you weren't there to pick me out?
You should've seen her when the soup arrived in her lap.
Oh, she never had a lap. Ever see anything quite so straight sitting down?
- No. A lamp post.
- Optical Illusion.
There go me beads.
Oh, well, it's fun looking back, isn't it?
You're an awful old fool, you know?
How about that 40 winks?
- Little froufrou. She hasn't altered much.
- No. Still the same.
I shall now wake up with a nice, fresh smile for Fritzie.
Good morning, Fritzie.
Here is your morning cup of tea:
And your morning bun:
- Court, I shouldn't be doing this.
- Oh, lie down. You've got lots of time.
- Well, you get me up. I rely on you.
- Leave it to me.
- The C.O. coming to see him off.
- Gun's are all right.
They'd better be. The rest of the plane too. She's going on a real trip this time.
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening, sergeant.
- Check the guns?
- Yes. They're all checked, sir.
- You're not flying, sir.
- Yes, I am, sergeant.
- Good luck, sir.
- Thanks, sergeant.
As a matter of fact, thanks for everything.
Give my love to the bees and the chickens.
- Switch off.
- Switch off.
- Contact.
- Contact.
- Have you got that?
- Yes. Replacements tonight.
A Flight at dawn.
B Flight accompany bombers.
- You got that, Phipps?
- Yes, sir.
And another thing...
...keep in touch with the observation posts at Mainz for news of Courtney.
- I think we--
- You think? Well, don't think!
Tell them to keep their eyes open.
I think he's coming back.
- Just a little bit, sir--
- No, no.
I think you take a little, sir.
We've got a petrol trench down the side of the field.
When we hear his motor, we'll light it, of course.
Yes? Any news.
- Here's good ne w s for you.
- Good news?
You have received special mention for your part in stopping the enemy advance.
What?
The 59th has received special mention...
...for their work in stopping the enemy advance.
Why wasn't it me up there, Phipps?
I'm the one to be up there.
If only I'd known he was--
He may come back.
Here he is!
Enemy plane!
It's his helmet and goggles.
It means a very gallant gentlemen died this afternoon.
And for what?
What we have all these deaths accomplished?
So many fine chaps who have died in this war...
...and are going to die in the future wars.
That's all, gentlemen.
Goodbye, Court.
Come along, sir.
Fall in, gentlemen.
Come along, lads. Line up, please.
Attention.
Orders for tomorrow morning.
Come along.
The 59th has received special mention...
...for its part in checking the enemy advance.
I know that--
Pardon me, gentlemen.
Commanding officer's inside, sir.
Will you follow me, please?
Wait here, please, gentlemen.
- Replacements, sir.
- Bring them in, Sergeant Watkins.
This way, please, gentlemen.
Lieutenant Carter, reporting from the pool for duty, sir.
Very good, lads. Fall in.
Attention, commanding officer.
Stand easy.
Gentlemen, you will be glad to know...
...that the 59th Squadron has just received special mention...
...for its part in checking the enemy advance.
Orders for tomorrow:
A Flight, ready to take off at dawn.
Patrol Marne Sector, 3500 meters.
B Flight, accompany bombers.
Mantez Wood Sector, 4000 meters.
You understand, gentlemen, that this sector is a particularly dangerous one.
You new men, watch your flight leaders.
Act instantly on their signals.
That will be your only chance of coming through.
That's all.
Now, look here. That's a river.
Water. Ganges.
Is that the Mutier escarpment?
What river is that?
No one ever crosses that river... because beyond that is the Mutier escarpment.
I'm afraid you're wasting your time with him.
He's working himself into a juju.
All right, Riano. Take him away.
Very helpful, I don't think.
Always the same old tales.
Mutier escarpment too strong, too high.
What they mean is if the elephants have a burial place... that's the elephants' business, and we've no right to butt in.
- Perhaps we haven't.
- What?
And let $1,000,000 of ivory go to rot under the earth?
Just how keen are you on this idea?
It means escape from this cursed hole.
- I'm keen, all right.
- So am I.
Excuse me, miss. Can I help you?
I'm Mrs. Cutten. Mrs. Dr. Cutten.
How do you do? Thank you so much.
I'm looking for my father.
I can't think why he isn't here.
I cabled him.
My name's Parker. Jane Parker.
- Excuse me. Did you say Miss Parker?
- Yes.
How exciting.
What a good chance we came down here.
Why, this is Mr. Holt, your father's partner.
- How do you do?
- What marvelous luck.
How do you do? He's still here, my father?
- He hasn't gone away or anything?
- No, he hasn't gone.
You caught him just in time.
Shall we walk along together this way, then?
- What about your baggage?
- It's here.
- I'll take care of it.
- I forgot my sketching paper.
- Will you bring it along?
- Yes, of course.
Shall we start now?
It's just a few steps along.
You see that big building on the right?
- How is my father?
- He's very well. He's always well.
- You're not letting your hair grow again?
- I beg your pardon. I didn't hear you.
I wonder if I could get that haircut, but the doctor hates old fashions.
Here we are. I don't want to butt in.
- If you'd rather see your father alone...
- Yes, I would.
I see. If there's anything that you want, let me know.
- In a community like this...
- Thank you.
Perhaps I shall see you this afternoon.
Come over to have a cup of tea...
Hello.
Jane. Whatever...
What on earth.
Darling, don't ask questions.
Don't do anything. Just be glad to see me.
What's this mean, dear? You're crying.
You mustn't do that.
No, but you're going to have to wait till I get through.
There.
There.
All through.
Let me look at you.
You're just the same.
Yes, but a bit more grizzled and moth-eaten.
That's only because you've been missing me.
- You have been missing me, haven't you?
- Missing you, my darling.
That's better.
Now say you're glad to see me, or I shall go right back.
I'm afraid you'll have to do that in any case.
Shall I?
Listen, Dad, from now on,
I'm through with civilization.
I'm going to be a savage just like you.
We'll talk about that later.
Now let me have a look at you.
Attractive.
Mighty attractive.
I don't know how I managed it.
Cable for you, sir.
Just came in by the boat.
Hello, Beamish. See who's arrived.
It isn't. It is.
Knock me for a row at ninepins if it isn't little Miss Jane.
Hello, Beamish, old boy.
But I say, what brings you to this awful hole?
That's a perfect criticism of Africa.
- What's the cable, darling?
- From you to say you arrive today.
I call that perfect service.
Hello, Holt.
What do you say to this for a surprise?
- My daughter, Mr. Holt.
- We have already met.
He was kind and got my baggage.
Did you find it?
- I did.
- Tell them to bring them in here.
- Here?
- Yes. I'll show you where to put them.
Boy, put this down here.
The dressing case down there.
And put those trunks somewhere around here.
That's grand.
Just pile them up wherever you can find room.
Look, you can just leave those there, anywhere.
- Yeah, that's fine.
- Good heavens.
I told you I'd come to stay.
But what have you got in there in all that?
Just the necessaries of life.
Can I get you a nice cup of tea, miss?
Isn't that English?
I come 6,000 miles and all I'm offered is a cup of tea.
What's wrong with a drink?
All right, I'll get you one.
- Shall I send the rest of the baggage?
- What?
I like your Mr. Holt. He's nice. Don't you?
- Six big...
- What?
I was talking about Mr. Holt.
Yes, he's a nice fellow.
We get along splendidly.
He hates Africa, too.
- Hates Africa?
- Yes.
- I don't believe it.
- Why not?
He's too strong and sturdy-looking, like you.
- I don't like Africa, either.
- I don't believe that, either.
Yes, I think I'd better be...
Darling, don't be silly.
You're not embarrassed by me.
Why, you've bathed me sometimes... and very nearly spanked me, too, several times.
Very nearly.
Perhaps if you actually had,
I wouldn't be so obstinate.
And I am very obstinate.
- What are you trying to do?
- Clean my face.
- But what's wrong with soap and water?
- Everything, darling.
Must preserve that schoolgirl complexion.
What's that?
Who are they?
The Wakumbas.
- The ones with the big hats, who are they?
- No, they're Kabaranda.
There are a couple of hundred ostrich feathers... in each of those headdresses.
What you might call putting a feather in your cap with a vengeance.
- What are they doing here?
- They come to trade.
All right, let's trade them.
You're butting into my business.
Butting in? You're mistaken.
I'm managing it.
Beamish, bring me my hat.
Do they always sing like that when they come to trade?
That's not a song.
They're invoking their gods to give them the best of the bargain.
I don't blame them.
Darling, you've done far too well out of one small store.
I don't think it's quite nice.
Look, here, young lady.
I resent that.
I must see your lady customers.
It looks as if their shopping's been successful, anyhow.
How women suffer to be beautiful.
I see you're breaking into society.
These are our very best people.
I know. I feel quite out of fashion.
Now let me show you what the well-dressed men are wearing.
Those markings on the shield mean they're the foremost warriors of the tribe.
Not really?
Why, that little fellow there, he seems quite harmless.
On the contrary.
If you read his shield, it shows that he's killed five lions.
- Really?
- Or men.
Yes, over here we have the Wakumbas.
You'll notice that their dress is entirely different.
And these natives here, are they of the same tribe?
Yes, they are.
Here's your hat.
You'll be catching your death of sun.
Thank you.
Bit early for him to start dancing, isn't it?
- Who?
- The baby. Look at him.
Jane, suppose we get a move on.
- You do think I'm a child, don't you?
- No, I've ample proof that you're not.
Look, every man his own feather duster.
Who are they?
The council of the Aloas.
Say, Parker, there's old Chief Oomtelli.
Possibly he can tell us about the Mutier escarpment.
Not a chance, Holt.
I've been trying him for years.
Darling, what is this Mutier escarpment?
When they get past this falderal... let's hope they'll be in a mood for substantial trading.
- Come on.
- Let's get along.
Father, you still haven't told me about the Mutier escarpment.
Remember my telling you a fairytale about the elephants?
Hundreds. Which one?
The one about why one never finds a dead elephant in the jungle.
Let me think.
Why, of course.
I remember.
An elephant can always tell when death is coming for him... and when he hears the call... there's a secret place to which he wanders.
A place where he can lay his bones with his ancestors.
- A place of rest.
- That's it.
The secret graveyard of the elephants.
Somewhere to the east, there's a mysterious barrier of mountains... called the Mutier escarpment.
And the natives won't say where that Mutier escarpment is.
It's sacred. Taboo.
If one of them is found even to have looked at it... he's put to death by the witch man of the tribe.
Now, Holt and I believe... that beyond that Mutier escarpment somewhere... lies the burial place of the elephants.
You do? But why?
Of course. Ivory.
Enough ivory to supply the world.
There's a €1,000,000 for the man who finds it.
- And how much do I get for helping you?
- You're not going to help. You can't.
Mr. Holt, I know you'll understand.
I do want to go so terribly.
I think if she wants to go as much as all that... she won't be a hindrance.
I think you're probably the nicest man I ever met.
Anyone's nice who gives in to you.
You disagreeable old darling.
I'm mad about you.
Leave me alone. I'm not used to this.
Can you shoot?
Like an angel.
Riano, let me have that rifle.
- Beamish.
- Yes, miss?
Hat.
Satisfied?
Quite.
I'm tired. I'm going to turn in.
Good night, Holt. Good night, my girl.
- Good night, Dad.
- Sleep well.
Tell me, am I a nuisance?
Do I get in the way at all?
Not in the least.
You've shaken down to it marvelously.
- Better put this around your shoulders.
- Thanks.
The altitude plays funny tricks with the temperature.
I'm not cold.
You may think you're not.
- You're very silent.
- I feel very silent.
You know, Jane...
I'm not a romantic sort of a person or anything like that... but if we get through this all right... is there any kind of a chance for me?
With me?
I don't know.
I haven't thought about it much.
Will you?
I thought I hated this country.
Since you're here I almost love it.
Do you, Harry?
- I'm very glad.
- Are you?
Glad you like Africa.
Oh, poof.
Now you're laughing at me.
A little bit, perhaps.
But very tenderly.
- Old man hyena sounds pretty lively.
- Horrible noise, isn't it?
Yet, I don't know. It's part of it all.
- Love it, don't you?
- Love it. Who wouldn't?
Look.
Isn't it marvelous?
And the funny part is
I feel so completely at home.
Really?
Good night, Harry.
Funny little hand... so capable and so strong... and yet, so soft and so white.
Don't crush it, Harry.
I might want to use it again.
I'm sorry.
Good night, dear. Sleep soundly.
Soundly? With all this noise?
Isn't he grand?
So proud, so fierce, and yet, so infinitely soothing.
Why, there's another one quite close.
Yes, much too close.
Keep a man on the fire all night.
Keep them going.
Yes, bwana.
Hello.
Must be a village near here somewhere.
That drum doesn't seem stationary.
It seems to be coming closer.
- It is.
- Help, bwana!
What was that?
Didn't sound like an animal.
Hold it there.
Get him some water.
- He say he look at Mutier escarpment.
- Mutier escarpment?
Make him tell you which direction. Where?
Did you get that?
We have to get him under cover.
Head back to your fires.
- What's the matter?
- They're after him. They're close.
Who are they, Harry?
What did he say?
He's looking for some fellow that's broken the big law of the tribe.
No man's passed here.
We should have seen him.
I told him that.
- They're like evil ghosts.
- Those are the Ubangis... one of the most feared and courageous tribes.
Yet they're afraid of the Mutier escarpment.
It may not be fear. It may be superstition.
To some of them, the elephant is sacred even alive.
How much more so in death?
- Have they gone?
- Far enough.
One good turn deserves another.
He'll tell us now.
Come on, get up.
He's dead.
Anyone would die who look at Mutier escarpment.
Poor fellow.
- He died too soon.
- Did he? I wonder.
He was crazy with fear, yet he managed to point.
And that's the direction in which he pointed.
And that's the Mutier escarpment, eh?
Yeah, and all we've got to do now is climb it.
Mother Earth must have some very particular secret up there...
putting up a wall like that.
Here.
- Why? Is this going to be dangerous?
- No.
All has to be done according to Hoyle, though.
Look out back there.
It's a bit tricky here.
You all right, Jane?
At the moment.
Be careful.
Steady, Jane. Don't lose your nerve.
We're all right.
What was in that pack, Parker?
Medicines, trade goods.
Poor devil.
That's too bad.
I don't suppose it could be helped.
You all right, now?
Yeah, I'm all right.
How are the rest of the boys?
- All right, bwana.
- All right. Start them going.
Now, Jane, take it easy.
Easy now.
Give me your hand.
Hold her, Holt!
- Parker. Riano.
- Yes, bwana.
Quiet, now.
All right.
- Give me your hand.
- Easy, now.
Give me your hand, dear.
Good girl!
Aren't I a fool, Harry? I'm sorry.
I'll promise to forgive you if you don't do it again.
Would you like to sit down and rest for a while?
No, really. I'd rather go on.
- You're quite sure?
- Sure.
Good girl. Come on.
- How are the rest of the boys, Riano?
- All right, bwana.
I don't think we need this anymore.
Let me help you.
Darling, you mind if I flop for a little while?
It'd do us all good to flop for a little while.
Anything you want?
Yes, a nice hot bath.
What was that?
Can't say.
- What do you make of it, Riano?
- Maybe hyena, bwana.
Maybe.
Come on.
- That was a human cry.
- Human?
Say, Parker, how do you feel about...
- going on?
- I've had enough.
I know why you're saying that.
And I'm not going to be made an encumbrance of.
I'm not frightened of a few weird cries.
Now let's get that ivory.
- Riano, come on.
- Yes, master.
- All right, Riano, come on.
- Yes, bwana.
- What's the matter?
- Boys scared, bwana.
You've got your whip.
Give them something else to think about.
- Let's be on our way, come on.
- Quick.
Another barrier.
Does that mean we lose the elephant tracks?
Yes, but with good luck we'll pick them up on the other side.
Hold on.
My gun.
They may be tough customers.
Father, without prejudice... would you say that was a friendly noise?
I'm afraid we're intruding.
- Riano, you better get the boys back.
- Yes, bwana.
Gently, dear. Slowly.
Look out. We're in for it.
Gently, Jane. The river's alive with them.
The dying elephant has to swim this.
Look there.
I'll feel much better when we've put all this behind us.
Rafts?
- Riano.
- Yes, bwana?
Cut wood for rafts. Two.
Father, look.
How's that for a touching domestic scene?
You can't tell me she's dangerous.
Dangerous? I'd hate to interfere with that child of hers.
- How are they getting on?
- All right, I guess.
Come on, Riano. We can't be here all day.
And the long one. There we are.
- Come here.
- Give me your hand.
- All right, Riano. Push off.
- Yes, bwana.
Harry, aren't you coming with us?
The boys will need a little firsthand persuasion... in order to keep going.
We'll be close all the way across.
All right, Riano. Come on. Shove off.
Watch the end here.
I don't think we'll be able to pole a straight course.
I'm willing to detour.
After all, they live here.
Get in the middle of the raft, Jane, and stay there.
All right.
I think they're just curious, don't you?
I hope so.
- Riano, gun.
- Yes, master.
- Getting nervous, Jane?
- No, not a bit.
Don't shoot wildly, Jane.
Get them around the ears, otherwise you just tickle them...
- then they're dangerous.
- I know, Harry. I'll try.
- Get him?
- I think so.
I hope so.
- We'll take the lead, Riano.
- Yes, bwana.
Come on, boys. Pole faster.
- Still like it, Jane?
- I'm crazy about it.
No, I'm crazy to have brought you here.
Why, Father, they look just like catfish on a rainy day.
Good girl!
Kill him, Holt. I missed him.
Stop poling.
Hold up, Parker. They're getting too thick.
Stay, boys, stop poling now.
What's the matter?
- Fire, Harry, fire.
- I can't. My gun's jammed.
Get him, Holt.
Get going before he comes back.
All right, now. Hurry.
Come on, boys. Push this.
Harry, look out!
He's going under your raft!
Watch out, Holt.
He's coming up underneath you.
Hurry, boys. Pole quicker.
Pole away to the other end.
Never mind me. Help this boy here.
Is he on?
It's too late to do anything about him.
Look out, boys. Here comes the herd.
Pole for shore. Come on.
Let me have your hand, Jane.
- Again, Holt.
- Right.
Here we are now.
Father, come on.
Give me a hand.
Get back in there.
Come on, Riano, let me have a gun.
They're still coming, Parker.
Don't shoot. They'll stampede.
That was friendly of someone.
- Riano, who else is gone?
- Musaki gone, bwana.
- That cry we heard from the river.
- Yes, it must have been.
You get the boys to make camp here.
I'll go see if I can pick up the trail.
- Harry, don't get lost.
- I'll try not to.
Thanks. Tooch, you come along with me.
Come on, Jane.
We'll get a little bit further from the river.
Make way, boys.
- Good. We'll camp here, Riano.
- Yes, bwana.
Put one tent there... a couple here.
- You boys can camp up there.
- Yes, bwana.
What was that?
Ape.
Look.
White, too.
Father, that cry.
Father, look.
Hello there.
Come down.
Riano, you speak to him.
He can't understand.
Call one of the boys. Try another dialect.
Come down, I tell you, or I'll shoot.
I don't think he even knows what a gun is.
After him, Riano, or we'll have the whole tribe on us.
Where'd they go, Riano?
Jane, you'd better stick close to us.
Jane, where are you?
Answer me, Jane.
- Parker.
- Why don't you answer?
- Jane, where are you?
- Parker.
What's the matter, Parker?
- Jane. He's taken her.
- What are you talking about?
Don't let me go.
Hold onto me.
He's come to get me!
Don't let him take me!
Let me...
Don't. Let me go.
Let me go, you wild beast!
Get off me! Let go!
Stop!
Let me go, you brute.
Take your hands off me.
Take him away.
Thank you.
- Thank you for protecting me.
- Me?
I said, thank you for protecting me.
- Me.
- No.
- I'm only me for me.
- Me.
No. To you, I'm you.
You.
No.
I'm Jane Parker. Understand?
Jane.
Yes. Jane. You?
And you?
- You.
- Tarzan.
That's right.
Please stop. Let me go. I can't bear this.
What's the use?
Yes. I am hungry.
Hungry.
Tarzan, where are you going?
Tarzan, don't go without me.
I'm afraid of her.
Tarzan, take me with you.
Wait. I'm coming.
Jane! Hello!
Father, here I am! Here in the tree!
I'm here. Father.
Hold it.
Father, here I am. Here in the tree.
Bwana, look there.
All right, Jane. We're coming.
We're coming. Keep still now.
Don't come down, dear.
Stay where you are. We'll help you down.
- Quick, Riano. Get up the tree.
- Yes, bwana.
Go, Riano. Look out for that big ape.
Harry, don't shoot!
There now.
It's all right, dear. Don't cry.
Get the boys together, and let's get away from here.
Wait a minute, Parker. He may come back.
No, let's go quickly, please.
Hurry.
All right. Come on, boys.
You're in a queer mood, Jane.
Yes, I know.
It must have been a terrible shock.
I've been reproaching myself all the time.
Reproaching yourself? Why?
My dear, you don't need to.
What is it?
- Were you very frightened?
- At first.
I thought he was a savage.
Now I find out he wasn't. That's all.
I can't make it out. How did he get here?
What does it matter? He's happy and...
At least he was until...
Father, did you hear his cry when that ape was shot?
- He'd probably never been unhappy before.
- My dear, he's not like us.
He's white.
Whether white or not, those people, living a life like that... they've no emotions.
- They're hardly human.
- Human.
He's human, all right.
Riano, send some of the boys out for firewood.
Am I interrupting anything serious?
Jane's got a theory that you were wrong in killing that ape.
- Wrong?
- Cruel.
To whom?
To him.
Why do you laugh, Harry?
Isn't that the best thing to do?
- Is it funny?
- Funny? Extremely.
That you should be considering the feelings of a man-ape.
It's a pity I didn't put two bullets into him and finish the job.
I wouldn't talk like that.
Don't you think it's being melodramatic and absurd?
- Absurd?
- Extremely.
Bwana, Mohammed dead in water.
- How did it happen?
- Riano find man's footprint in mud.
You better call the rest of the boys back into camp.
You don't think he did it?
I don't know.
Harry, you can't do that.
- He isn't a wild animal.
- He's a murderer.
So were you to him when you killed that ape.
We can't stay here and do nothing while he picks us off one by one.
We've to make him understand we mean him no harm.
- I could make him listen to me.
- You can't even talk to him.
I know I could make him understand me.
Please let me try.
- It's ridiculous.
- Please let me try. It's worth it, Harry.
Shall we risk it?
- Perhaps if you think it's all right. Yes.
- All right. Go on.
You mustn't do that. You promised.
Harry, let me speak to him.
Harry, you mustn't.
Bwana.
Blood. I got him.
Tarzan.
Jane?
I wish you'd knock before you enter my boudoir.
I suppose you know that's going to make your head worse.
- Head?
- Yes, head.
Head. That thick bit under your hair.
No, Tarzan.
Oh, dear.
I really can't make you any more bandages.
You'll get dizzy. You'll fall.
You'll hurt yourself.
Stop it at once. I'm not a bit amused.
Tarzan. You see, you'll fall.
Tarzan, where are you?
Come up. Where are you?
That wasn't a bit charming.
It was just like a nasty, little boy.
- Boy?
- Yes.
Please let me go.
- Go?
- Yes, go.
- Go?
- Yes. No.
Don't let me go. Tarzan, don't.
I didn't say dunk. I said don't.
Tarzan, don't.
Nice Tarzan.
Take Jane bank.
Yeah. Bank.
Fooled you that time.
Tarzan! Watch out!
Help! Tarzan, save me!
What was that?
Where are you going?
Don't take me up. Stop.
Help, Tarzan. Don't.
I think you're the most horrible man
I ever knew.
What color are your eyes?
Yes, I know.
The color of the forest. Gray-green.
I wonder what you'd look like dressed.
Pretty good.
You'd be a great success in London... and I believe you'd love it.
Or would you?
Women are such fools.
They'd spoil you.
I don't think you'd better look at me like that.
You're far too attractive.
I love saying things to a man who can't understand... who doesn't even know what kisses are.
Love it.
I daresay you would.
I think we'd better land.
Bank. Land.
Let go, Tarzan.
Go under.
Got you.
Where are my boots?
I do wish you wouldn't be so playful.
Give me those boots.
Tarzan, please give me those boots.
Tarzan, let go of my foot.
That hurt me.
Don't be so funny. Now let go.
All right. When you've quite finished,
I'll put my boots on.
Tarzan, you're tickling. Stop.
- Love it?
- No such thing.
You can't get round me like that.
There's quite a difference, isn't there?
Do you like that difference?
You've never seen anyone like me before, have you?
Tarzan, where are you going? Don't go.
Tarzan, please.
- What's going on here?
- Boys tired, bwana.
Tired? Give me that thing.
You tired?
Is anybody else tired?
Come on.
What am I doing here... alone, with you?
Perhaps I better not think too much about that.
Just be here... be happy.
And I am happy.
Not a bit afraid.
Not a bit sorry.
I wish I could make you understand.
Perhaps I can. Gradually.
Come here.
What are we going to do about us?
- Us?
- You and I.
Darling, you got that right.
Tarzan. Jane.
Hurt me. Boy.
Love it. Jane.
Darling, that's quite a sentence.
Tarzan, what is it?
Riano, we'll camp here.
- Yes, bwana.
- What?
You're not fit to go on.
It's time you had a rest.
- I'm the best judge of that.
- Rest today. Go on tomorrow.
- What's the good of tomorrow to me?
- Tomorrow good like today.
You can do what you like. I'm going on.
Come on now, Parker.
Just 10 minutes will refresh you.
Come on. Please.
Just 10 minutes, but no more.
- All right. Riano, some water.
- Yes, bwana.
Those are tears, Tarzan.
You've never seen tears before, have you?
You know why they're there?
We must say goodbye.
I must go to him.
Yes, I must.
I can't do it. He loves me.
Love?
He loves me, too. I'm all he's got.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye?
Yes.
Tarzan, don't look at me, not like that.
If you do, I shan't be able to go, and I must.
Don't you see?
Goodbye, my dear.
Why, he's brought me back.
Daddy.
There. You're all right, dear.
Don't go!
Come with us. We'll all go back together.
Jane, dear, you belong to us, and he brought you back.
Now you must let him go.
- He belongs to the jungle.
- Not now.
He belongs to me.
No, my child.
Stay where you are.
Not a move out of anyone.
Can't stay here and be taken.
If we resist, we'll be butchered.
- Hand over your gun, Riano.
- Yes, bwana.
If we do nothing, we stand a better chance of getting away.
Perhaps you're right.
Are these pygmies?
No, they're dwarves.
Ready, Jane?
Yes, I'm ready.
- The drums are getting louder.
- We're getting nearer.
- Nearer what?
- I wish I knew.
Go to Tarzan, Cheetah!
Give me your hand, dear. It's dark in here.
- It is dark, isn't it?
- Don't show any fear.
I'll try not to.
Father, stay close.
Harry, look!
Bwana!
Why have we stopped?
Is something wrong?
Tarzan, what is it? Look, he's wounded.
He wants them to change mounts.
No, we must go on.
But, Daddy, he's dying.
I know. Our one chance...
The elephants' graveyard.
If he's dying, he'll take us there.
But, Daddy, you can't. You're hurt.
No, I'm all right.
He's our one chance.
Tarzan, we must go, too. Understand?
Tarzan, with him.
It's beautiful.
Solemn and beautiful.
We shouldn't be here.
It's riches. Millions.
Parker, it's true.
We knew, didn't we?
Father, what is it?
We came this way once before.
There's something sad about retracing.
You've been very brave, Jane.
He found what he was looking for.
I know that somewhere, wherever the great hunters go, he's happy.
I can't bear to let you say goodbye like this.
Goodbye?
You'll be coming back, Harry.
I can see a huge safari with you at the head... bearing ivory down to the coast.
Only this time, there'll be no danger... because we'll be there to protect you every step of the way.
Uncover. Uncover.
Uncover.
Uncover.
-Captain Swanson of His Majesty's forces.
-Lieutenant Fouchier.
Fifteen English prisoners for 15 French prisoners.
Sergeant, deliver the prisoners to Lieutenant Fouchier.
Yes, sir. This way, sir.
One of these days, l'm gonna push the open end of a musket down your throat.
Step back into line there.
My apologies, Lieutenant. lt is customary for His Majesty's soldiers, if l may call you that without maligning my sense of proportion, to observe the rules of civilized warfare.
-Yes, sir.
-Tripe.
-Who said that?
-l did.
Did you ever see a white man teach an lndian to walk up under a flag of truce and blast a soldier from a gun hidden under a blanket?
-What's your name?
-His name is James Smith.
What do you mean by talking for him?
Professor sometimes talks for me.
Corporal, hold these men for court-martial.
They'll pluck those cocky rooster feathers out of your tail
-for court-martialing civilians.
-Civilians indeed.
-Deserters, more likely.
-We're civilians!
Born in Pennsylvania, taken three years ago by Caughnawaga lndians.
We're initiated to the tribe.
You can tell your story to a court-martial. lf you're not a fool, l reckon you'll listen to it here!
We escaped while the tribe visited Quebec.
The French caught us and here we are.
Shackle these men with the rest of the deserters.
We're civilians!
You've no right to hold us here!
Colonel Clapp, Captain Swanson. l'd like to get you behind a barn, back home in Pennsylvania !
Jim !
And the Professor.
-Where have you been?
-We were taken by the Caughnawagas.
-You still got your scalps.
-They made us blood brothers.
-Are these friends of yours?
-Aye. Let me introduce you.
There's Jim Smith and the Professor.
From Pennsylvania. l thought they were dead.
They've been missing these three years.
The best lndian fighters in the colonies.
All right, Corporal, you may release them.
You'd better read your dispatch, Captain.
Gentlemen, Quebec is English.
Hurray! Hurray! Hurray!
Quebec is British.
That closes the frontier.
There's no more stirring up the lndians against us.
No more massacres.
Thank God.
General Wolfe said he'd do it and he's done it.
General Wolfe is dead, sir.
He died with his face to the enemy. l guess we can go home now, Mac.
Maybe our stomachs found a friend.
All right, come on, boys.
You've had your hot meal.
Now back to work.
Break stone, Teagle, help Spode with that axle.
-MacDougall.
-Hiya, laddie. l heard you was up in Canada with
General Wolfe, fighting the French. l was just showing the General how to fight lndians. l killed 30 Onondagas in one day. Aye.
-No.
-Aye.
How dead lndians do multiply!
Well, maybe it was 20 Onondagas, but that's not to be saying that a MacDougall like myself couldn't have killed 30 if he had a mind to.
They're bosom cronies of mine.
-This is Jim Smith and the Professor.
-How are you?
-Strangers around here, ain't you?
-We've been away a little while.
This is Gary Smith's laddie.
-Oh, yeah.
-Could you spare a mite of that grub?
Oh, fall to, lads. We've had ours, but there's plenty hanging. l suppose you wouldn't be having a snifter of whiskey, just a wee drop?
You know, my appetite's not so good without a bit of a tonic just to wet my whistle.
No, Mac, we don't traffic in firewater.
We only carry trade goods for the lndians.
-Trade goods?
-l thought the border was closed.
Don't have to be, now that the French have surrendered Quebec.
Colonel Brady's out in Ohio making treaties with the lnjuns now.
They're real friendly-like, the lnjuns.
The only friendly lndians are dead lndians, l say. lf we don't trade with them, the French will.
You know how they stir them up against us, with firewater. lt's a patriotic duty we're doing.
Did you ask Tom Lowther about this patriotism?
The lndians beat in his boy's head with a musket and left it sticking in his skull.
Rum !
So you don't carry any spirits.
Stop! Where are my spoons?
Stop, thief! Stop!
Five pewter spoons missing and a tankard.
Blast them for the thieves that they are and blast me for the trusting woman l am !
Now, Janie, that'll do, l'll have no swearing from a daughter of mine.
So, you're back.
Now, now, lassie, it was no fault of mine. l was coming home, sober as a judge, when, bang, without even a word of apology, a patrol got hold of me and pressed me into the army.
Against my will.
Even when l told them what a beautiful and dutiful daughter l had.
Who'd tend the tavern while you're away, swilling army rum?
What, me?
Why, l've got the best here in the cellar at home.
That you can't get at.
Oh, Mac, don't go away and leave me again.
Take me with you like you used to.
Oh, you contrary female MacDougall!
No.
Hello, Janie.
Put me down, Mac.
And the Professor, they're back from the very mouth of the grave.
They'd all say,
''He's dead, you'd better forget him.''
And l'd say ''Sure, he's dead, he's forgotten,'' but l knew it wasn't so. l didn't let myself know anything else, l knew you'd come back.
And just where were you, and what were you doing?
-Well, a...
-Oh, no, no, l don't care.
You're here now.
Blast it, Mac, do you have to stand around and watch a girl make a fool of herself?
Get in and get your rum.
And you, too, Professor. lt is a wee bit chilly.
You've grown up, Janie. lsn't that much nicer, for both of us?
Still the same shameless wench.
Am l supposed to be ashamed? l will be if you want me to, but l don't feel ashamed,
-not before the man l'm going to marry.
-Marry?
Yes, you gave me your word, you promised, don't you remember?
There's another girl!
Somewhere you've hitched yourself to another girl!
Blast you for a bigamist scoundrel!
-Your temper is no better.
-l'll have the law on you! l'll have you put in stocks for breaking your promise!
-l promised a half-grown girl.
-Half-grown? Half-grown?
Stop whimpering about marriage.
We're very hungry and tired men.
Come inside, Jim.
Half-grown, am l?
Well, l'm full-grown, now. l killed 40 Onondagas in one day.
The barrel of my gun, it got so hot, l used it to warm up the rum toddies. lt got so hot, l...
The war is over, Mac. Come on, get behind the bar and work for your keep.
Woe is me. l'm a victim of the skirling blood of the MacDougalls.
Janie, are you happy?
Oh, mind your pig.
What am l to do?
The whole town knows we were going to be married.
Now you've changed your mind.
Why don't you put a rein to your nimble imagination, girl?
Let him do his own talking.
The Professor always talks for me.
You only thought he promised.
They'll point me out as a girl who was left.
Well, then, marry and fool them.
Who'll have me after you've tossed me aside?
Well, l don't know.
You're not bad to look at. l think so, too.
But maybe it's because we've lived with lndians so long.
You're an lndian, cruel and merciless!
Janie, l'm no man for you.
-He's going over the far hills too much.
-l wouldn't care! l wouldn't ask for anything except to go with you.
You can't die once, and then come alive and go away again. lt's like making me see you die twice, l couldn't stand it.
Jed, Tom... lndians. lndians. They're all around Fort Pitt.
Shawnee and Delaware.
They've burned the town and they've scalped the kids in school at McDowell's Mill.
Let's be on the way, boys.
McDowell's Mill is 20 miles from here.
-Any more guns in the house?
-Two long rifles.
Well, l know where we can get some more.
You're not going again, Jim, you're not!
Mac, Mac, tell him not to go!
Don't be a fool, lassie, you know what we have to do.
All dead, Jim. Horrible.
Dirty, murdering heathens. l'm taking my family and leaving while we're still alive.
Aye. l'm fair sick of it.
A remarkably fine season and what good is it?
You can't harvest for fear of bloodthirsty barbarians.
Men, if the Conococheague settlements stand firm the country will have some little sort of safety.
Safe for the blasted tradesmen.
For the fields of corn you planted.
For the plenty we've taken and will take from this land. l will water it with my blood before l give it up.
-And l.
-And l.
Everybody accounted for?
All except Jacob Miller's two kids.
They must have taken them alive.
Mrs. Lewis, do you know if Jacob Miller's kids got taken?
Mrs. Lewis? l picked up the tracks.
About 20 of them. Delawares, l think. l'm not sure, but they seem to have a couple of youngsters with them.
-Any missing?
-Yes. l want about 10 men with me.
Stewart, Calhoon, M'Cammon, Professor.
You got plenty of charcoal over there,
M'Cammon?
Yes, and plenty of bear grease.
Now, we're traveling light, so are the Delawares but they'll be held back because they're carrying the kids along.
Twenty of them. lt's just the odds l like. l'll kill them myself like l did them Onondagas in one day. l wanna see your guns.
Trade musket. They're no good.
They misfire too often.
Sorry, M'Cammon, we can't take you with us. lf it misfires, Jim, l'll use my knife. l'm only taking men with long rifles, M'Cammon.
-Mac! Mac!
-Janie, lassie. What brought you here?
With lndians loose, you might have been scalped from your eyebrows to your shoulder blades.
Here, l'll get somebody to take you back. l'm not going back. l've seen what the lndians did and l'm going with you.
-l forbid it.
-What?
Positively.
You forbid it?
How much is this valley your home?
Did you see those bullet holes in the walls of the tavern?
Who fought off the lndians? Not you.
You were always busy somewhere else fighting somebody else's fight.
And now you're forbidding me to fight my own.
-Get back to the tavern, girl.
-Let her come along.
Oh, Jim.
Jim, you're a fine and generous man.
All right, off with your shirts.
Smear your bodies.
We're lndians, you know.
Well, off with your shirt. lf you travel with us you travel like the rest of us.
How sly. How very sly.
We'll need your long rifle.
-Here's your weapon, M'Cammon.
-Thanks.
Some of you boys see that Janie gets home.
They didn't come out here.
We'll have to split up, Jim.
Delawares. They've gone upstream.
Mac, you take the right bank, l'll take the left. l want him alive.
Jim, 20 lndians a day has always been my minimum.
Don't leave me at 19. l'll never be able to hold me head up again.
Come on, we'll get the water out of him.
Oh, darn, Jim, laddie.
They trade muskets and trade tomahawks.
-Everybody all right?
-All right.
All here.
Gather up the rifles and the powder horns.
English cartouche box.
What regiment is it, Tom?
Why, that's Colonel Brady's regiment.
He's supposed to be out on the Ohio making treaties.
He said they wiped out Brady and the men.
We teach them everything, don't we, Tom?
His Excellency, Governor Penn, will see you tomorrow.
Thank you.
What is the meaning of this intrusion? l sent word l'd see you tomorrow.
What we've got to say can't wait till tomorrow.
-Why, how dare...
-Our apologies, Your Excellency,
-we're Conococheague Valley men.
-l see.
Frightful tragedy, frightful.
This is General Gage, in command of His Majesty's forces.
We've come to request Your Excellency to forbid trade with the lndians, and to ask military protection for the valley. l understand and sympathize with you, but l have judged it consistent with the good of His Majesty's service to order all available troops westward to meet the lndians on their own grounds.
While they murder us on our grounds.
We're carrying out a military policy designed to guarantee the permanent security of the frontier.
Haven't you eyes enough to see that?
We've eyes enough to see only our own dead.
Colonel Brady has received the lndian chieftains...
Colonel Brady will receive no more chieftains...
What's that? What's that?
Dead men make no peace treaties.
-What are you saying?
-Colonel Brady and his men are dead.
Dead?
Their heads split open with tomahawks made by white men.
''A proclamation. From this day all persons whosoever they may be,
''are forbidden to trade with lndians.
''Anyone failing to heed this warning, does so at his own peril.
''The Valley of the Conococheague is forthwith taxed £1 per capita
''for the erection of Fort Loudoun, and the maintenance of His Majesty's troop
''to be permanently stationed there for the protection of said valley.
''John Penn. God save the King.''
This is the reward of aiding the mother country with her trade.
Warehouses filled with goods.
Goods that cost us hard cash, fetched 3,000 miles from England.
Must we endure it?
What's the army for, if not to protect business?
And what's government for, if not to protect business?
Certainly not to interfere with it.
Gentlemen, you still do business with the army, don't you? lt will take 20 years for the army to buy up the supplies we have on hand, and furthermore, there's no profit in it. l wasn't thinking of that.
You'll have a military permit to take goods through to the outlying forts, won't you?
Yes.
Now, if a shipping clerk made a mistake, and sent a few wagonloads of trade goods through with the military supplies, they'd be traveling under the protection of a military pass, wouldn't they?
-Barmaid, barmaid!
-Yes, sir.
Another for each of us.
All right, boys. Get out the musket balls.
Fifty keg of musket ball for Fort Pitt.
Fifty keg of musket ball for Fort Pitt. Right.
Put the musket balls aside.
We load them on the top. l'll kill the man that drops a keg of that rum.
-This is it, sir.
-Give the order to halt, Sergeant.
-Company, halt!
-Company, halt!
A tavern?
Their magistrates and commissioners meet in a tavern?
Yes, sir.
Most every place in the outlying sections, the tavern's sort of community public house,
-government quarters, newspaper...
-Accompany me inside, Sergeant.
Yes, sir. l'm Captain Swanson.
Who's in charge here?
Magistrate Duncan and Magistrate Morris, they're in charge.
Glad to meet you, gentlemen. l'm sure we shall get on.
May l say how grateful we are to have you and your men, Captain?
Your gratitude belongs to the Crown,
Mr. Magistrate.
We're all servants of His Majesty.
Now, as to provisions,
Sergeant McGlashan will weekly requisition our needs.
You'll be given army certificates redeemable in cash.
-That ought to be satisfactory.
-We'll be happy to accommodate you, sir.
All provisions delivered to the fort are to be in prime condition.
Any attempts to supply provisions of inferior quality will be met by severe rebuke.
Severe rebuke.
Do l make myself clear, gentlemen?
You don't know us, sir, otherwise you wouldn't be saying that.
You will notify me each week when the provisions arrive.
-Yes, sir.
-l will make the inspections myself.
That's all, gentlemen.
Why, the uppish gamecock.
-l demand that man's arrest.
-On what charge?
The man was in contempt of court.
You're not sitting in a military session, exchanging prisoners now,
Captain Swanson.
For which l'm grateful. l rather resent the army gambling on exchange and losing.
This is a civil court.
And l advise you to keep that kind of a tongue in your head.
Jim, Captain Jim !
Them blackguards has took up the trade again.
They come through Shippensburg this morning, three wagons.
-You mean with trade goods?
-Yes.
They wouldn't dare, they wouldn't dare.
With the King's proclamation on the door of every inn and every magistrate's house.
-lt must be army goods.
-lt ain't. l seen them. lt's paint, knives and hatchets and powder.
You'll turn them back, of course.
Are you sure of your information?
Sure of it? l tried to reason with them.
They said, ''Get the devil out of the valley if you're scared of lndians.''
-Why weren't they stopped at Carlisle?
-Stop them?
They've got a military permit signed by the Commanding Officer in Philadelphia.
You must be mistaken. lf the goods are under permit, they're military supplies. l ain't mistaken.
Are you implying that my commanding officer is corrupt?
You'd best mind your tongue.
He's implying nothing, but for us to let those goods go through would be committing suicide. l'll arrest any man that interferes with a military permit.
Then you're going to let the goods go through?
My orders were to protect the frontier, and to teach a wholesome respect for the
Sovereign law and His Majesty's forces.
Those orders will be carried out, even if l have to declare martial law.
And to think we asked for them.
The swine, the crooked swine.
We'll stop them ourselves. lf it's force you're thinking of using, you'd best forget it.
-You'll end in hanging.
-Then we'll hang.
At least we'll die with our scalps intact.
Calhoon, l think you could do with a drink,
-as can Mac...
-Aye.
...and the Professor.
M'Cammon and a few of you other boys, come to my room.
Janie, bring some hot toddies.
Looks like it's going to be a cold night out.
We've work to do.
-Ready?
-Aye.
Aye.
Blankets off.
Each man 10 feet apart.
Shoot over their heads.
Get rid of that blanket.
What's the matter with you?
-Are you drunk?
-You're choking me.
Janie, what kind of a joke is this? lt's not a joke, Jim. lf you're going to hang, l'll hang with you.
That's the least you can let me do.
Ah, the female MacDougalls were all famed for their tenderness.
The lass is fair daft about you, Jimmy.
All right, men.
Hold it!
Steady down these horses!
Listen to me!
Take these loads out in the clearing and pile them all in one place.
And be fast about it.
Take whatever government property you may be carrying and clear out. Get out!
All right, boys.
Pile the rest of this stuff up, boys.
We're going to light a little fire of our own.
Get all the stuff out of all those wagons. l don't think the government is going to like very much this destruction of their property.
Come in.
-Sorry to disturb you, sir, but...
-l'm Callendar. l pack train for Poole and Simmons,
Philadelphia.
-Charmed.
-We contract army supplies.
Go on, get on with it, get on with it.
A pack of blasted settlers, dressed like lndians, attacked my train and burned the army goods.
Army goods?
There's a cartouche box.
That's all that's left.
The shot's melted down, the powder is...
-McGlashan, call out the squad.
-Yes, sir.
-Nearly murdered me and my men.
-Rabble, cutthroats, criminals!
Destroy His Majesty's goods, will they? l'll teach them the meaning of the King's name, if l have to write it across their backs with a lash!
Look alive, men.
-Quick, get him.
-Aye, he's one of them. l'll brook no escape.
You can still see the black paint behind his ears.
That's dirt. l never wash behind the ears.
Let go! lt's a girl!
Hold her.
The man that loosens her receives 30 days' bread and water.
Who were the others with you?
What were their names?
Just like that.
You'll wear the seat out of those silk britches before l talk.
Janie!
What did you take her for?
-For destroying King's property.
-She's destroyed no King's property.
McGlashan, clear this rabble.
You'll not take the lass to Fort Loudoun without a warrant.
By the living Jehoshaphat, l'll blow out your heart.
You'll do what, you treasonable dog?
Disarm them.
Now, shall we get on to the fort, McGlashan?
Yes, sir.
Company, halt!
What do you mean by halting the King's men with an armed mob?
We want those prisoners, Captain.
You took them without warrant.
-There's still English law in the valley.
-They're British and freeborn. lf they're to stand trial, it will be before 12 of their peers, not before the likes of you. l've an idea they'd be court-martialed for treason, is that true?
And suppose it is?
Suppose l send them to Carlisle for court-martial, what will you do about it?
We'll do this.
We'll be forced to fire on you.
No, Jim, Mac, we'll go with them.
Move the prisoners to the rear and fix bayonets.
No.
Perhaps you'll understand we mean to have those prisoners. l'll release them only to your magistrate under the condition they stand trial for treason. l'll see that they stand trial.
Release the prisoners.
Release the prisoners.
Will you promise to stop the traders?
You have this promise, that any man who interferes with a military permit will make the acquaintance of the hangman.
Shoulder your firelocks, quick step, march.
We'll sew up this valley so tight, a cricket can't get in or out without our say-so.
No. Turn back.
The valley is closed. Turn back.
-Stop. The valley is closed.
-Stop. Turn back.
-The valley is closed.
-Stop. Turn back.
The valley is closed. Turn back.
Turn back. The valley is closed. Turn back.
''Men of the Conococheague,
''you are to come to MacDougall's Tavern
''and fill yourselves with liquor and swearing.
''There is a large bounty for everyone, military goods.
''We'll have Captain Swanson whipped or hanged.''
Don't you think this is a little obvious?
You gotta make it plain.
Them people are thick-headed.
''We may do as we please for we have the law and government in our hands.
''Any bounty captured must be spent in our town,
''the only town tolerating drinking, swearing, Sabbath-breaking,
''and any outrage we have a mind to do.
''Signed, James Smith and his
Black Boys of the Conococheague.''
Well, it should convince the Governor he's dealing with rioters and rebels.
They've blockaded the valley.
No word can get through except what they choose.
They wouldn't dare treat
His Majesty's troops with such indignity.
They've no respect for law.
Their magistrates are with them, leading them.
Have Magistrate Duncan come in. l've called their magistrate to Philadelphia.
Magistrate Duncan.
This gentleman informs me that you've encouraged and protected rioters in the Conococheague Valley in their illegal and disorderly proceedings.
There have been no illegal nor disorderly proceedings.
Burned my goods. They burned my goods.
The pack train was illegal,
Your Excellency, contrary to your proclamation.
There's what's left of the military supplies.
Does that look like trade goods?
This gentleman has been misinformed.
They were not government goods.
Were government troops fired upon?
Not one shot has been fired against the royal garrison, Your Excellency. l swear those goods were lndian trade goods.
More than that l cannot say.
More than that l will say.
My pack leader managed to evade the blockade.
Callendar.
Where's that advertisement?
These were found nailed to the trees all through the Conococheague Valley.
The one you have in your hand was taken from the wall of MacDougall's Tavern.
Sound reason for everything they've done, indeed.
Bloody-minded cutthroats!
May l see it, sir?
There's something queer about this advertisement, mighty queer.
No Conococheague man ever did this. l find it disagreeably necessary to apply to General Gage for the assistance of His Majesty's troops.
Reinforcements will be ready to march in a week. l demand military escort for my supply train.
You shall have it.
You will issue a warrant for the apprehension of James Smith.
You will lend your assistance in discovering and apprehending all persons who may be concerned. l issue no warrants against Jim Smith or any of the valley men.
-Jim? Where's Jim?
-There he is.
Jim, they're issuing a warrant for your arrest. You've got to leave.
Governor Penn himself is issuing it.
And General Gage is sending reinforcements in a few days to put down the insurrection.
-You must go, Jim.
-No.
Those traders will do anything to hang you.
And Gage has promised them military escort for their pack trains.
Callendar will probably rush through a train before the reinforcements arrive.
He'll be afraid to wait with too many soldiers about.
He will that, if he's carrying lndian trade goods.
-Well, we'll let the train through.
-Let it through?
Jim, are you crazy?
What is it, Jim?
What are you thinking about?
We'll use him as bait for a trap. lf Fort Loudoun becomes a warehouse for illegal goods, its commandant is done for. lt'll be proof that he's unlawfully conniving with traders.
We'll prove we're not rebels.
We have him now. He's taken the bait.
Tell the valley men to come to MacDougall's.
Jim Smith wants you to come to MacDougall's!
Jim Smith says, ''Come to MacDougall's! ''
Jim Smith says, ''Come to MacDougall's! ''
Jim Smith says, ''Come to MacDougall's.''
-Come to MacDougall's.
-Come to MacDougall's.
-Come to MacDougall's.
-MacDougall's.
Come to MacDougall's.
James, there's your search warrant, and it's all in order.
You'd better come along to serve it.
Just a minute, men.
M'Cammon, Calhoon, Stewart,
Lewis and Janie here are out on bail.
We promised the Captain they'd be tried for treason.
Now it isn't beholden for men out on bail to be appearing before a fort making demands. lf you think it'll be hurting you, then l'll stay.
That won't be necessary, Tom.
We'll try you immediately.
Jim, you can appear for the defense. l'll choose a jury, and if it isn't to your liking you can object.
The prisoners over there before the bar and the jurymen down here on this side of the table, as l call off your names.
Burke, Callahan, Brown, Reynolds,
Allison, Bouquet, Forbes, Spears,
Josephs, Owens, Grant, Pierry.
-Jim, have you any objections?
-No objections.
Gentlemen, what is your verdict on Tom Calhoon?
Not guilty.
-John M'Cammon?
-Not guilty.
-Stewart?
-Not guilty.
-Lewis?
-Not guilty.
-Janie McDougall?
-Guilty.
-What?
-Guilty as charged.
MacDougall, the court charges you to lock your daughter in the wine cellar until the court has time to pass sentence.
-You...
-Come along, lassie.
The moment you began whispering, l knew it was some filthy lndian trick! l think you'd best forget him.
He's bad medicine for lasses.
Mac, what, what's the matter with me?
Why does he treat me like this?
Janie-wanie, you called him right, lndian.
To him a squaw belongs at home. l hate him.
Aye, and if you're like your mother, you'll break your heart with your hate.
Go on with ye, you MacDougall, you.
Something must be amiss. They let me by.
They've no stomach for firing on troops.
They had the look of cats that had just swallowed a flock of birds.
They're all about the fort, sir, close to 300 of them, armed.
-Shut and bolt the gates.
-l've already done that, sir.
Order full garrison on the wall.
What do you mean by coming here with that rabble? ln the name of public safety, we want permission to inspect the trader's goods stored in your fort.
You've a rare appreciation of public order with an armed mob at your back. l have a search warrant to inspect the goods.
The goods are under my protection. l've orders from General Gage.
Here, do you see this?
That's General Gage's own order.
What more do you want?
Here, do you see this? lt's the King's proclamation.
We want to see the goods.
Nothing short of that will satisfy the people around here.
You'll inspect no goods in my care. l've my orders. lt might be as well to remember, this road is not a military road.
And while we're talking, you might get it through your head.
We built your fort.
We'll not have it used against us.
Now, will you let us in? l will not.
You're using our fort as a storehouse for illegal goods.
According to the King's proclamation, you're a criminal.
And we'll deal with you as a criminal.
Back, boys.
Be back, boys.
We'll kill every mother's son of them, the dirty rattlesnakes!
Come on, let's get him out of the road.
McGlashan, those men were under a flag of truce.
-Arrest the man who fired that shot.
-Yes, sir.
Don't jiggle him so much, lads. l'll put a torch to that fort myself, if l die doing it.
That was no army musket, Tom. lt was a long rifle.
That's right, it couldn't have been a soldier. lt was one of Callendar's men. l never even shot an lndian in the back.
Jim, we'd better ride you back to the doctor.
No, we gotta take that fort before reinforcements get here.
We must have the proof.
Then let's charge them.
That's what they expect.
Their muskets won't carry this far, our long rifles will.
So we'll fire on the fort, and keep firing. ln shifts.
One shift will rest while the other keeps firing.
They won't dare go to sleep waiting for us to charge.
But we won't.
We'll just keep firing.
Jim, could we no kill two or three of them maybe?
There'll be no killings, Mac.
Don't you think you'd better get back to the surgeon, Jim?
Give the order to fire.
-Full garrison on the wall, sir.
-Keep your men ready, Sergeant.
Tell them to hold their fire and watch for the assault.
Yes, sir.
Hold your fire, and watch for the assault!
Sergeant McGlashan.
Yes, sir.
Tell the men to get to the bottom of the barricade where the logs are the thickest.
Yes, sir.
And tell them that the first man that falls asleep
-gets 20 lashes to keep him awake.
-Yes, sir.
Stay awake, men. Stay awake.
They'll attack the moment you fall asleep.
Stay awake. Come along there. Wake up.
Wake up there. Wake up.
Sorry, sir.
-That's all right, lad, just stay awake.
-Yes, sir.
Two hour shifts today.
-How's Jim?
-He's all right. Let's keep going.
Come on. Two hour shifts today.
We need more powder and ball. l've got 50 kegs at the tavern.
-Take 20 horses, men, and go get them.
-Aye.
Good morning, lass.
Did you have a good night last night?
You men do it well, tormenting a girl.
-You must be born with the gift.
-Now, now, lassie.
Jim Smith and the magistrate's put you here for your own safety.
The powder is through there, lads.
-Mac, is a fight on?
-Aye, a grand fight. l killed 20 of 'em me self.
A great pity you can't scalp them. lt's no civilized to scalp white men.
Put some vigor in it, lads.
Jim Smith's waiting.
Jim Smith.
Put those kegs down.
Are ye crazy?
We're running short of ammunition.
Tell Jim Smith to get it somewhere else.
This is my powder and it stays here.
Now, put them down.
Just as things were going our way.
You'll be run out of the valley.
Well, maybe l will, but l'll be here long enough to see that, that white lndian hanging from a gallows.
Now, now, lassie, that's no way to be talking of a man who's half dead from a soldier's bullet.
-Oh, no, Mac, no.
-Aye, Janie, aye. lt'll be a miracle if he lasts out the day. lf you've let him be killed, l'll shoot the lot of you, every last man of you.
Heave ho, me lads, heave ho.
Jim !
-Where's Jim?
-Right there, by the fire.
Jim !
Darling, darling, darling.
How did you get out?
Do you think anything would keep me?
Do you think l'd let you die alone?
Die? Who said l was going to die?
Mac said so.
Oh, it's only in the shoulder, but if you're really set, l might die...
You wouldn't be doing that if l wasn't just a little bit helpless.
Now, what kind of a fool would l be, if l didn't take advantage of my opportunities?
Let's look at that.
Go away. lf he's a bit warm, it's that kissing business, not the bullet.
A white flag! Hold your fire. A white flag!
Jim, Jim. The white flag.
First we want the trade goods.
Second, he and his men are to get out of the valley.
We asked for them here, now we don't want them. They're to git.
Yes, sir.
And they may keep their weapons.
They agreed, Jim.
Heads up, lads. Heads up.
Show this rabble our heads are up.
Open the gates.
-Give the order to march, Sergeant.
-Yes, sir.
Squads right, march!
Forward, march!
Captain Swanson.
Company, halt.
Jim Smith would like words with you.
The goods are in the fort.
There's one thing we want you to understand.
We're law-abiding men.
There is one thing l do understand.
You're a lot of blasted traitors.
We whipped him !
We whipped the saucy peacock. l claim his scalp. ln the name of the law, l'll lift his scalp from his eyebrows to his shoulder blades!
Mac!
Let me at him.
He's worse than the black lndian devil. ln the name of the law.
Law-abiding men, loyal subjects.
Drunken rabble you are, but l'll be back! l'll be back and you'll pay for this!
Forward march.
-Forward...
-Forward.
...march!
Stop where you are, Callendar.
We're free to go with Swanson.
You'll go with Swanson later.
Get back to the fort.
Listen, men, wait a minute. l'm just a driver. l didn't have anything to do with the goods.
Thank you.
Jim better this morning?
He thinks he is, but he's not. l say we stay and fight.
We've whipped them once, and we'll whip them again.
Fight 200 regulars?
They'll probably come with cannon.
Magistrate Morris, load a wagon full of the trade goods.
Take it to General Gage in Philadelphia.
M'Cammon knows the south hills.
You'll avoid the troops that way.
But that might take several weeks.
The rest of us can hide in Martin's Rock.
They're 10 miles away, Jim.
That cock-sparrow Swanson is with them.
We'd better get started.
Then we'll have to tie you on your horse, Jim.
He can't hide in a cave. He'll die. l won't let him go.
He's going to see Dr. Stoke.
Back to the tavern, girl.
Back to the tavern.
Let men go about the work they've got to do.
Easy, lad, let us do most of the work.
When you get to Philadelphia, speak to no one but General Gage or Governor Penn.
And God go with you.
Come on, men, put some backbone into it.
Give me your foot. Put your arm around my shoulders. Careful!
-Put him in the cart, men.
-Janie.
-Put that gun down.
-l won't. l'm not going to be a widow before l'm even a wife. l forbid you to use such talk before all these men. lt's no becoming to a female McDougall.
Do you think l care what's becoming and what's not?
He'll die and just because he wants to be a big, brave, loyal chief.
He won't leave his men.
Well, his men can go hang for all of me.
He's going to see Dr. Stoke, if l have to kill you and him to do it!
Well, there's something in what the lass says.
She's a hysterical, arrogant shrew, and shouldn't be trusted with a lethal weapon.
Take it away from her.
Now, now, lassie, calm yourself, calm yourself.
You wouldn't shoot your loving father, would you?
The last male member of the fine line of the MacDougalls.
One more step, Mac, and the fine line is finished.
Wait, Janie,
Dr. Stoke is 15 miles from here. l can take him through.
What else do you think l want with him but to see him alive and safe?
Why do you treat me like a witless child?
Put him in the wagon.
-Put me astride.
-No, Jim, the lass is right.
She'll get you through.
You're being twisted about by a comely face.
She loves you, Jim.
Are we to be the victims of a girl's springtime fancy?
-l'm going with you.
-And me.
You'd do best, Mac, to stay far away from Jim for a while. l'm sorry, Janie, terribly sorry.
Rum and lndian fighting makes a poor mixture for the father of a young lassie. lf l had it to do all over, Mac, l'd pick you again.
''Whereas l have received information that sundry persons have,
''at several times, assembled themselves in armed bodies,
''and have in a most riotous and illegal manner
''presumed to interrupt the passage of supplies to the fort,
''l do hereby require all His Majesty's subjects
''to give such evidence as to apprehend all persons
''concerned in the leading of these riots
''so that the offenders may be prosecuted according to law.
''Signed, John Penn.''
God save the King.
Disperse them and get on with it.
Next prisoner.
Driving his cattle into the swamp and refused to billet. lsn't he one of the scum that whipped me? lt looks like him.
Put him in irons.
Turn them over.
-Another one.
-All right, stand in line. Stand up.
Put his leg irons on first.
Heave ho, here we go.
All right, get the other one.
Stay on your feet!
All right, stand over there.
Come over there.
Prepared to talk, gentlemen? l want James Smith.
The man that tells me where he is, wins full pardon. lf you'd serve your King with one-tenth the loyalty you serve that treasonable dog Smith, you wouldn't be in jail this moment!
Jim, Jim Smith! Jim !
He's not here. l know he's here, Janie. l've got to see him.
-He's not here. ls he, Doctor?
-No, he's not here.
-Jim, Jim Smith, it's Anderson.
-Shut up, you blasted...
-Will Anderson! Will Anderson!
-He's not here, l tell you.
-Shut up!
-You looking for me, Will?
Jim, they've got half the valley in irons.
No warrants, no trials.
Just a trader's word and you're in chains.
They're even paying off men that ain't had nothing to do with it.
You just don't have to like them to find yourself accused and convicted of riot, arson and armed robbery. l'll be right down.
Dr. Stoke said you're not well enough to go. lt's finally come. l knew it would, and now's as good a time as any. lt's been so pleasant here, Jim. l sometimes even thought that...
They think more of money than they do of men. l said, l sometimes thought that you thought...
No more trading with lndians.
Jim, Jim, please don't go.
Don't let me have to stay behind and die inside of me.
Troops sit in forts and the settlers die.
Let us get up to save ourselves, and they move fast enough.
All right, go ahead.
Go ahead, l don't care!
Get shot or hung from a scaffold!
We've obeyed the law, they've broken it.
You've always torn and twisted the heart out of me. l've loved you from the first minute l can remember, and you've brought me nothing but misery.
Well, l didn't expect much more, so l asked for nothing, and l'm not asking for much now.
You fool. You cruel, merciless fool.
Come, magistrate, join the fun.
What are you men going to do?
We are going to stand the red coats on their thick heads.
Your stomach's got to be right to take a whore.
They've gone to report to the fort.
We'll give them a half-hour start.
They are all drunk at McDougall's, bragging that they are going to take the fort.
McGlashan, take a squad and bring those men here.
Yes, sir.
Nine men are going to take the fort.
And nine drunks are going to take the fort.
The garrison's all asleep. The gate's open.
There are only three sentries on the wall, this side.
The guard's away across the parade ground, by the kitchen.
They're getting the morning rum ration. lt's grand rum. l could almost taste the smell of it.
The guns are stacked together, full 40 paces nearer to the gate than what they are.
All right, when we run, run crouched in the mist.
Put down those muskets.
Come on down and join the party.
Calhoon, stand at the barracks door and keep them inside.
Shoot the first one that shows his head.
Find your commandant.
Tell him if there's one move, l'll blow daylight through these men.
Yes, sir.
Mac, open the guardhouse.
Get those prisoners out here.
Will, get the flints out of those muskets.
Now, Corporal, find your blacksmith and fetch him here.
Yes, sir.
All right, lads, all right.
That's the last one, Mac.
Let me do for him, Jim !
Let me do for him once and for all!
Why not add murder to your traitorous acts?
You'll never learn, will you?
You'll never learn to know us.
Take him to his quarters.
We'll give him back his fort.
That's a mistake, Jim. l said we'll give it back.
All right, men, you can return to your homes.
And leave those muskets here.
Nine men.
Only nine men.
Nine men.
Nine men!
You'd best give up. We've got you now.
One move and you're dead men.
The boldness of the swine.
He's dead.
Now we have got you, Smith.
You've murdered him.
We'll see you hanged for that.
You killed him. My shot went wild.
You fired and he fell. That's murder.
So that's it.
Tie him to a horse.
We'll take him to jail in Carlisle.
Get the stiff one.
We'll bring him along, too.
What shall l do? They'll tear the jail down.
Well, can't you reason with them?
You're the jailer.
But it's a mob. Can't you do something?
Well, l can talk to them, but they aren't going to like these.
Briggs, Briggs, come here.
Bring your chisel. Take these irons off. l've got a wife and children.
Please, tell them l'm on your side.
Here, Briggs, here, here. Right over here.
Hi, Jim, hi.
Just hang on. We'll get you out.
Mac, much obliged to you and the boys, but it'd look bad if l ran away. lt'd look like l was guilty.
Best way you can help me is to break up.
They're planning to take you back to the fort and court-martial you.
They want you out of the way.
We've done everything according to law up to now.
Make way.
Law? What law?
This kind of law, the law of bayonets? l say burn the jail down.
Burn it down around their ears!
Aye!
Men! Men! l'll talk for Jim Smith. l know what he thinks.
He doesn't want anybody to get fired on by the soldiers.
But if any of us were in there, he'd go in and get us, soldiers or no soldiers!
Janie, hold your tongue.
Tell them, Professor, tell them for me.
Men, we've fought and won, but in winning we've lost something. ln defending one law, we've come to despise all law!
And if you go on like this, we'll destroy the very thing we fight for!
Men, disband.
Go home and let me stand my trial.
-Bring in the accused.
-Yes, sir.
Bring in the prisoner.
You may remove that barbarian from the courtroom.
-He's a witness.
-Remove him.
Step out, you.
Now, laddie, l was only clearing my throat. lt's the right of every free-born Scotsman to clear his throat if he's a mind to. l clear mine a wee bit noisily perhaps.
Now, do not push. Do not push, laddie.
Any lout who feels the need of airing his spleen at the expense of the Court's decorum will find himself dining on bread and water.
Proceed.
-You're sure he's the same man?
-He made no pretense about it.
His attitude throughout was a contempt for authority. He was openly seditious. l object. The defendant is on trial for murder, not for treason. lt is our intention to establish a connection between the two.
He fired on His Majesty's troops, destroyed army supplies, interfered with the King's messengers, released prisoners held by us for court-martial.
The pack-train leader.
Ralph Callendar!
Raise your right hand.
Do you swear or affirm that the evidence you shall give in the case now in hearing shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God? l do.
Did you hear Tom Calhoon offer to turn
King's evidence against James Smith? l did, sir.
When Tom Calhoon said he was going to Philadelphia to swear to the Governor about Jim Smith's treason,
Jim Smith shot him dead. l tried to stop him but Jim fired that shot so sudden and unexpected.
And he was Tom Calhoon's best friend.
Your witness.
Can you identify this, Mr. Callendar?
That there is the shirt that Tom Calhoon was wearing when Jim Smith killed him.
There's the bullet hole.
Can you identify this?
That looks like the gun he shot him with.
Now, how far would you say
Jim Smith was standing from Tom Calhoon, when you say he shot him?
About four feet.
He just put the gun up against him and shot him.
About that?
You're certain of all else you saw, why aren't you certain of this?
That's how far it was, l'm certain.
May l have the Court's permission to make an experiment?
An experiment? l should have thought the facts were sufficiently plain to speak for themselves.
Well, why try my client at all? Why not just hang him and be done with it?
Oh, all right, proceed with the experiment.
All right, Janie. ls that young person loading that weapon?
That young person is a dead shot.
There's no cause for alarm. l shall be personally responsible for any acts committed here.
Get on with it.
This is decidedly irregular and smelly.
How many more of these detonations are we to endure?
Just one.
You will note the shot fired at 20 paces carries a clean hole.
That fired at six inches is deeply studded with powder burns.
You will also notice, gentlemen, that the shirt Tom Calhoon wore carries a clean hole with no evidences of a burn.
Gentlemen, that shot was fired by some other in the crowd, someone else standing many paces away.
Order, order.
Will you permit a scoundrel to go free?
A scoundrel who leads treason and sedition and defies England? ls there to be a stench in this courtroom that will linger for centuries? l protest.
-The man is innocent of the crime.
-You are under arrest, for revealing your decision before a majority vote.
Captain Swanson.
Captain Holmes, place Mr. Poole, Ralph Callendar and the drivers under arrest for breaking the King's proclamation and transporting illegal trade-goods.
Captain Swanson, you'll retire to your quarters.
-l'll talk to you there.
-Yes, sir. l am a soldier, sir.
They could have been carrying the murderer of my own father, if they'd had a permit for it. l would have defended him with my life.
There is such a thing as understanding, Captain.
-Yes but...
-l know, l know.
We haven't taught soldiers to soften themselves at understanding.
We'll probably suffer for it.
Well, l've ordered the release of Jim Smith.
And l'm sorry, Captain Swanson, but l must relieve you of your command.
You'll report to Philadelphia and prepare to leave for England.
Yes, sir.
-Goodbye, Jim.
-Bye, Jim.
-Bye, Jim.
-Bye.
Sure you don't want to go, Mac?
Those Tennessee hills are big, wild and away from the crowd.
There'll be you and me and Professor and our surveyor friend.
Mac, are you thinking of leaving me?
This is your home, Jim.
You'll be back, l know.
Make it soon lad. We'll miss you.
Thank you, sir.
Well, Janie, even the worst of enemies must part.
Don't forget us, Jim.
Don't ever forget us.
Not for one small minute.
-Now, lass.
-l'll do my own talking.
There's so much for a man to do that there's no time for, well, other things.
But if there was time, l mean, if l was inclined, l mean... lt wouldn't be any other woman.
Only you.
-Bye, boys.
-Bye, lad.
Janie, where are you going?
With my man.
You've the skirling blood of the... lf she ain't a contrary female MacDougall!

I, Lemuel Gulliver
give thee a faithful history
of my most interesting adventure
in the South Sea.
On the 5th day of November, 1699,
having reached latitude 30 degrees,
two minutes south,
a storm of great fury suddenly...
All's well!
All's well!
# All's well! What's a rainy day? #
# Never mind that cloud. #
# Behind that cloud you'll find a golden ray. #
# All's well! Laugh your fears away. #
# See the light ahead. Right ahead. #
# There's a moonlit night ahead. #
# Everyone, come on have fun. All's well! #
Why do they make me sing that song?
The poet who wrote it was certainly wrong.
It's bright ahead. The light's ahead.
I'd rather go home and go right to bed.
All's well!
My feet are wet and my bunions ache, and yet I've to keep wide awake, all night!
I wake folks up to tell them things are all right!
And, # All's well! What's a rainy day? #
# Never mind that cloud. #
# Behind that cloud you'll find a golden ray. #
# All's well! Laugh your fears away. #
# See the light ahead. Right ahead. #
# There's a moonlit night ahead. #
# Everyone, come on have fun. All...
A, A, All's well! Wha, wha, what's a rainy day?
The king has visitors.
Do you know they're signing a wedding contract?
There's a giant on the beach!
There, there's a giant out there!
Your majesty.
Thank you, your majesty.
Marriage Contract
King Little of Lilliput
Does this 5th day of November 1699 give the hand of his daughter
Princess Glory to Prince David son of Bombo
King of Blefuscu!
Quite in order, fine.
King Bombo!
Well we did it, you little rascal, you.
We did it.
Yes we, we certainly did, didn't we?
Just a couple of old dag cupids, I think! [laughs}
Your majesty, the wedding things are here.
There's a giant on the beach!
Let me go!
Let me go! Let me go!
There's a giant on the beach! Let me go!
Exquisite taste, exquisite!
Roses, Freesia, Rhododendrons,
Ranunculus, Snap Dragons, and Daisies.
Ahh!
They're pretty Posies, aren't they?
Beautiful blooms, beautiful!
Oh!
May I?
Oh, please do!
Magnificent!
Oh! A masterpiece!
Vanilla. Wow!
# Faithful. Remember, that whatever I do,
I'm always faithful, my love. #
# Faithful, with all my soul and thankful for you, #
# who came from heaven above. #
# We'll dance tonight together, on a world with me we'll find. #
My only little daughter. I dread losing her.
Huh, Buck up there old boy, you're not losing a daughter. You’re gaining a son.
My son!
# So I'll be faithful and faithful as I promise to be, and you'll be for all mine. #
Hmm. Lovely melody.
Yes, we like it.
That is Faithful. The song of Lilliput.
It will be played at the wedding tomorrow.
Of course. Of course.
What's that, Faithful? Oh, no, no! Forever!
The song of Blefuscu must be played at the wedding.
But Bombo, Faithful is always played at our weddings.
It, it's tradition, sir. And it's very pretty.
Yes, yes, I know. Pleasant little ditty, oh but hardly appropriate for this great occasion.
But Forever! There's a song for you! Ha, ha!
Faithful will be played.
Bah! Fodder. Absolute fodder. It must be Forever!
Faithful.
Forever!
Faithful.
Forever!
Faithful.
It will be Forever, or there will be no wedding!
No wedding? But the cake and the pretty flowers and.. oh Bombo, you'll love Faithful.
Ahh!
It's war!
There's a giant on the beach!
It's war!
War. Woe is me. Woe is me.
I found a mountain, your majesty. I found it!
It was man, a man mountain!
War isn't nice.
It was, was this big!
No, no. It was this big!
People get hurt in wars.
He's as big, as big as, as,.. big as, as, as..
Wait your majesty!
Bombo can't frighten me. No sir.
Don't stand there like a nincompoop!
I'm trying to tell you that there's a giant!
When I get my dandruff up, then look out.
But Glory, poor little Glory.
Don't look now gentleman, but it's war.
War? Whoopee!
# Forever, forever, #
# There won't be anyone but you. #
# Remember I'm true, my sweet. #
# Forever, forever, #
# You'll share in everything I do, #
# And keep smiling through, my sweet. #
# I'll have just you here in my heart, #
# And I'll trust you though we're apart. #
# So, forever, forever, #
# My guiding angel you will be. #
# So always have faith in me. #
Shh!

Oh yeah? Well where is it now?
Well ah, ah, I can't understand it.
It was right here.
Honest.
Giant, huh! Dragging us out into the dead of the night.
Yeah, chasing wild geese.
Gabby must have been seeing things.
Maybe it just got up and flew away.
Yeah, and breathing fire.
Look out Gabby.
Your giant's gonna bite ya!
Hey, hey fellas, maybe it was me he saw.
Look. I'm a giant! I'm a giant!
Psst!

Listen.

HE SAID, "THAT'S THE GIANT ON THE BEACH!"
Shh!
Shh!
Shh!
There isn't a moment to waste.
Every last man must do all that he can.
Work with the greatest of haste.
So bind up its hands, its arms, its chest, its neck, its feet!
And I'll do the rest.
Let's go!
Quiet.
Quiet.
Quiet.
Hey?
Shh!
Careful!

Aw! Aw! Help! He's killing me!
I don't want to die! Help! Help!
He's killing me! Help!
Hey!
Well, what are you rubes waiting for?
Tie him up!
Get the wheel. Come on, roll in the plate.
Bring pegs to hold him.
Bring jacks, tacks, cleats, axe.

Okay, let's go!
Giddy up! Tally ho!
Giddy up! Tally ho!
Giddy up!
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Pull in the ropes there!
Not so fast! Not so fast!
Hurry up, there! Slow down!
Get the wheels past!
Phew! I don't know what they would do around here without ME!
Ohhhh!
Heave! Heave!
Faithful was always played at our weddings... Faithful.
Faithful.
Your, your, your majesty.
Huh?
I've got the giant!
The giant. Oh, yes, yes, the giant.
Well bring him in. Bring him in.
Okay. Okay.
Your majesty, I don't think he'd fit in here.
Oh you don't, huh?
So it's not good enough for him, hmm?
Well where is he?
Out there, your majesty.
Now, then.
Humph! Not good enough for him!
Well, where is he?
From here. On!
Call out the guards, the army, the navy, women and children first, I'll see you later.
Search him, men. He may be armed.
Ohhhh!
Ugh! Why do I get out held?
Your majesty! Let me in!
Look your majesty! Let me in!
Let me in! Let me in!
Let me in! Let me in!
Help! I don't like this!
Ohhhh!
Let me go! Help! Help!
Let me go! I don't wanna die!
Well, well. what have we got here?
Help! Help!
Don't eat me! Don't eat me!
Help! I won't taste good.
I'll give you indigestion.
A man. A tiny man.
You can't do this to me.
I've got a wife and kids.
Millions of kids.
Hold on there, mate.
Nobody's going to hurt you.
Help! Put me down! Help! Help!
Drop that! Drop that!
Well, another one. Who are you?
Who me? What? I'm king around here.
Guards! Guards! To the turrets!
Archers! Surround the giant!
Surround the giant! Guards!
Well.
Huh! You'll pay for this.
Ready!
Aim, fire. Aim, fire.
Aim!
Fire, fire, fire.
How do you like that?
Want some more?
All right, let her go!
It's Bom
Bo!
Force the gates! Man the battlements!
Defend the city!
We're attacked! We're attacked!
Stop! Stop you swine!
Get back to your posts!
Get back there and fight!
We of Blefuscu are not!
... afraid of anything.
Well, where's everyone gone?
This is no way to treat a harmless visitor.
Look Gabby, we've won! Gabby! Gabby?
See Gabby? They've gone.
Yes, sir. Scared stiff.
Hello there.
Come now, don't let my size frighten you.
You, your majesty, surely you're not afraid of me?
Nuh uh.
Well, good. Then let me present myself.
My name is Gulliver, your majesty.
Lemuel Gulliver, a shipwrecked sailor.
At your service.
Well, welcome to Lilliput,
Mr., Mr. Gulliver.
Uh Mr. Gulliver, can you fight?
Well your majesty,
I can lick anybody my size.
Ah, splendid, splendid!
I don't think Bombo will give us any further trouble while you're around here.
No sir!
He's on our side, Gabby.
He's on our side!
There's nothing to fear!
The man mountain's on our side!

Outta the tub! He's a coming up!
Hey look out! Grab it! Pull it off! Nab it!
Pull it off! Take it off!
You understand that not until that giant is removed can our forces taste the sweet fruits of victory!
Now then, it is up to you to carry this message to my spies in Lilliput.
Be off and may luck be with you!
Too-de-loo!
Get going!
Your majesty, I'm sorry the little princess isn't with us.
Yes, too bad. Too much excitement for one day.
Dear spies: Get rid of that Giant or else... Cordially yours King Bombo

Ahoy, mate! Ahoy, m...
Ahoy, mate! Ahoy! Ahoy!
I see that you're a sailor boy.
I owned a boat. A beauty, too.
Fifty times as big as your a, as big as your a, as big as your shoe.
My, my.
Hoy, hoy.
Lost her though in a glorious gale, but I came home on the back of a whale.
But tell me though how you caught the whale.
Simply grabbed a hold of his tail.
My, my.
I, I,
I climbed a mountain peak so high.
I bumped my head against the sky.
And there I was, where was I?
On the Island of Alibi.
Hoy, hoy.
My, my.
Hi, hi.
But now my life is very dull.
They ought to make me an admiral.
Now that's the job that I'd enjoy.
I must be going. Ahoy! Ahoy!
My, my, my.
You put that ball in there.
And then it goes down and around.
Pull that thing.
And it comes out here.
The g-g-g-g-giant!
Wow!
The light. The light.
Douse the light!
He's gone.
Phew!
Hello! Anybody in there?
Nobody here but just us spi...

# There won't be anyone but you. #
# Remember I'm true, my sweet. #

Forever! Forever!
That's the song of Blefuscu!
A spy!
Charge!
A spy!
A spy!
Charge!
A spy! A spy!
Charge!
Where is he? Where did he go?
Concealing a spy.
And at a time of war, too.
That makes it worse!
Carry on the search men!
Mind you, your father will hear of this.
King Bombo,
Say the word and the giant is a dead duck.
..is a dead duck.
P.S. What do we do with the body?
Two hearts and a wedding broken by a melody?
Incredible!
Wait a minute.
I have an idea that might turn this malice to a melody!
Sing Faithful and Forever together, as one song.
The giant will be a dead duck.
Ha! Now we are getting at somewhere!
Dear Spies, Destroy. Crush.
Obliterate! Annihilate!
Kill him!
I will attack at dawn!
Affectionately yours, Bombo.
Whatcha got there?
Attack at dawn. Attack..
Bombo's attack.., Bom..., Bom...
Guards! Guards! Guards!
Bombo's attacking! Bombo's attacking!
Bombo's attacking at dawn!
Bombo's attacking! It's war!
Bombo's attacking! It's war! It's war!
It's the end of the ending!
To the beach! To the beach!
Bomb.. attacking!
What?
Bombo attacking!
It's war! It's war!
To the beach! To the beach!
The enemy attacks!
To defend Lilliput.
To defend Lilliput!
Yes, forward march.
Gulliver! Gulliver! Where are you?
Bombo's attacking.
Where are you Gulliver?
We'll be wiped out!
Gulliver where are you?
Gulliver! Gulliver! Bombo's attacking!
Gulliver! Gulliver! Bombo's attacking!
It's war! Gulliver! It's war!
Gulliver! Where are you?
Gulliver! Gulliver! It's war!
Gulliver! Bombo's attacking!
Bombo's attacking! It's war!
Put me down.
Hah! Well, where you been you lazy, long legged, overgrown lummox?
Now, get down there to that beach and wipe out that Bombo and that bunch of Blefuscuians.
And tear em to pieces and don't leave a man alive to tell the tale.
Forward march! Get going!
Aye, aye, sir!
My, oh my.
Hey! Wait for me.
Gulliver, wait for me!
Wait for me, Gulliver!
No note.
Where is it?
What did you done with it?
Where did you lose it?
Who's got it now?
Gulliver! Gulliver! Wait for me!
Gulliver! Gulliver!
Let me go! Let me go!
Let's go!
Hold on there!
We can settle this peacefully.
Listen!
Hold you fire!
Hear what I have to say.
Bombo, order your men to lay down their arms.
Must I make you listen?
David, look! Gulliver's thunder machine.
Wait here, Glory.
David!
Fire!
Fire!
Pull! Come on! Pull! Pull!
David!
Poor, poor, foolish little people.
Look what you've done.
Now go ahead! Break your nutshell heads over your songs!
But did you have to break Glory's heart,
King Little, because you are thoughtless and selfish?
And you Bombo, o mighty warrior, what have you won?
You were too stubborn to think, too busy quarrelling to lend ear to the harmony that might have been yours.
But now in your sorrow and despair, perhaps you will listen to your songs as they might be sung.
# Faithful forever whatever I do #
# Remember I'm true, #
# remember that #
# Faithful forever and thankful for you #
# I'll keep smiling through, #
# remember that #
# We may be apart now and then #
# But I'll hold you in my heart #
# Till you're in my arms again #
# Faithful forever I promise to be #
# So always have faith in me #
In behalf of the peoples of
Blefuscu and Lilliput,
With eternal gratitude and love in our hearts, we christen thee, Gulliver!
# Come back again, come back #
# Wherever you may be #
# Come back again you sailor man, sailor man #
# Back again from the sea #
# Come back again you sailor man, sailor man #

-- The End --
Gentlemen, 1949 marks the 25th anniversary...
...of the FBI as it exists today.
Like many another success story, this one had humble beginnings.
The first G-men worked under staggering disadvantages.
Do you realize that not many years ago, a fleeing kidnapper or bank robber...
...could take one step across a state line and thumb his nose at us?
Often when we made an arrest we had to walk...
...into a rain of hoodlum machine-gun fire...
...though we were forbidden by law to carry a revolver.
But, gentlemen, the bureau did have as weapons...
...truth, drive and vitality.
Even before the government armed us with guns and laws...
...G- men became a dreaded underworld whisper.
I'm going to take you back to those days...
...and show you a motion picture about a man named "Brick" Davis.
It's the daddy of all FBI pictures.
It's the first one that called us G-men.
The cars are old, you won't see women wearing the new look...
...but you will see something that the bureau has never forgotten.
That while times change and habits change and styles change...
...one thing is constant:
The man who want to get more out of life than he puts into it...
...the hoodlum...
...he's the same today as he was then.
He is still a public enemy.
All right, Vince.
Now, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you must know what justice can mean...
...to a man who is defenseless because he is poor.
How would you feel if a huge corporation bulldozed you...
...into selling your life's work...
...an invention that has made them millions, and selling it for what?
A paltry $5000.
I ask you, ladies and gentlemen, to look upon my client.
A man who has stood silently at a workbench for years...
...planning, working, striving to create...
- Are you Davis?
- Yeah, come in.
Glad to meet you.
My name is Joseph Kratz.
- Oh, yes. Sixth Ward.
- Oh, you know me, eh?
- Heard of you. Sit down.
- Thanks.
Got a good case for you, Davis. One that'll make you a lot of friends if you take it.
That's fine. What do you get out of it?
Me? Nothing. A friend of mine's in jail on a bum rap.
- I want you to defend him.
- What'd he do?
Why, he got drunk last night and beat up his old lady.
- His mother?
- Yeah.
- Nice fella.
- Well, you know how things like that are.
- They book him on assault and battery?
- They're gonna hook him on the Sullivan Act.
The sap was carrying a gun and beat her with the butt of it.
- Accidentally?
- Yeah, accidental.
But if she kicks off, he's up for murder.
Do you think I'd defend a guy like that?
- Why not?
- I'd rather beat his brains out.
I don't want the case, Kratz.
It smells.
Now, wait a minute, just a minute,
Davis, before you turn this down.
There are a lot of boys around my ward who'll play ball with you if you take it.
You don't want a lawyer, Kratz, you want a crook.
Take your dirty work to somebody else.
Now, don't pull any of that honest lawyer stuff on me.
"Big Shot" McKay didn't pick you out of the gutter...
...and send you through college for nothing.
- Out.
- All right, all right.
When you change your mind, let me know.
Call me up. You'll never get anywhere playing shyster for that rat.
Hey!
- Eddie!
- Yeah, Eddie.
That's a swell way to treat a customer.
Just a greaseball!
Well, if it isn't old man
Department of Justice himself.
- When'd you get here?
- Flew up this morning.
- Business?
- Yeah.
Sit down. Park yourself.
Well, well. What, no brass button, no badge? What is this?
Nobody has any time to polish them.
Too busy going around with a big badge frightening people.
What a lawyer. A year out of school, you're using the same argument.
And it's still good.
What's the use of going to law school...
...if you're gonna throw it over and play cops and robbers.
If you had gone into practice, you'd be at the top now...
...instead of flatfooting around.
Law's a great game.
Maybe so. But you sure look funny sitting behind a desk.
I suppose I have to entertain while you're here.
Not for a couple of days. I have an appointment with a chap named Durfee.
- After that, okay.
- That's swell.
I'll try to clean up most of my work.
I think I can get a whole day off.
Are you getting much business?
Business is terrific.
I have to throw half of it out.
What's the use of kidding, Brick?
Kidding?
You ought to keep your law books dusted off.
Old eagle-eye.
- Things are pretty tough, aren't they?
- Yeah.
But only because
I don't wanna be a shyster.
Which means blackmailing and ambulance chasing.
I've been in too many back alleys as a kid to wanna go back.
You've gotta have a West Side office to get decent business.
And I've got the East Side and...
The elevated.
I wish you were in the department.
You'd make a good G-man.
- You starting that again?
- Yeah. What's more, you'd like it.
You'd be out seeing some action...
...instead of sitting in a law office getting fat between the ears.
It's a great department, Brick.
A great bunch of fellas.
When they tackle a job, they stick to it till it's finished...
...and no fat-faced politician standing around telling them what to do.
I brought a department report along and an application I want you to read.
Now, think it over, mule. I have to shove along. I'll see you Thursday.
All right, Eddie, I'll be here.
- Well, I'm out.
- Same here.
- Let you two guys fight it out.
- Check.
Well, 200.
- Two more.
- You're called.
Ace full.
The guy's right, the gardenia does bring him luck.
This keeps up, I'll believe it.
- Who is it?
- Durfee.
Hello, Leggett.
- Hello, fellas.
- Hello. What's eating you?
The heat's on me.
Will you lend me some dough?
- Dough? You wouldn't try to rib us?
- No, on the level.
How about that counterfeit you been printing?
- I haven't got any.
- What?
A government guy tailing me for the post-office job wrecked the plant.
- I've gotta get across the state line.
- Tough break.
- Okay, Dan?
- Yeah.
- Let us know when you're light.
- Thanks.
- I'll pay you back, double. So long.
- Don't forget that.
- No, I won't.
- Deal me out.
It's a tough break.
He ought to get himself an arsenal and stick around.
Why, those government guys don't even carry rods.
You're under arrest, Durfee.
Kill the lights.
Give me a reacher.
- What's the matter?
- Copper's got him.
Louie.
- How are you, Mr. Davis?
- Is Mr. McKay in?
- He's in his office, sir.
- Thank you.
Yeah, come in.
Oh, hello, Brick.
- Busy, Mac?
- No, come on in.
Well, sit down.
- Have a cigar?
- No, thanks.
Where have you been keeping yourself?
I've been sticking pretty close to the office.
- Much business?
- No, no.
Well, come on, kid, spill it.
What's on your chest?
- I wanna talk some things over with you.
- Go ahead, shoot.
Tell me, Mac, how much did you spend on me?
- I mean, education and everything?
- About 20 grand. Why?
That's an awful lot of dough.
Chicken feed when you like a guy.
Was that the only reason?
Well, maybe I wanted to see a kid that had the same start in life that I had...
...make a real success.
Haven't had much success.
Nobody gets ahead fast when they play the game on the level.
- That's the way you want me to play it?
- That's the only way to play it.
I been in rackets all my life, Brick.
They don't pay off. Except in dough.
Well, Mac, it looks like I'm gonna cross you.
- You wouldn't turn crook?
- No, no.
But I am giving up the law business.
I've tried to make a go of it, but it's no use.
Guess I wasn't cut out to warm a desk chair.
Well, maybe that's right.
What are you gonna do?
I've joined the Department of Justice.
They accepted my application yesterday.
How'd you happen to do this?
Buchanan.
I got you.
They want you in Washington.
Yeah, I'm leaving tomorrow morning.
That puts me on the other side of the fence from you.
That's where you ought to be.
But they're out to get you.
You and everybody else in your racket.
If they assign me to go after you,
I've gotta use everything I know.
You got to play ball with them, Brick.
Go to it.
Now, Mac...
You won't get me, Brick.
I'm going to quit.
I've been thinking about it for a long time.
But what about Collins and Leggett and all the rest? Will they let you quit?
They still take orders from me whether they know it or not.
- Hi, Louie.
- Gentlemen. Hi, boys.
Hi, Ruby.
Yeah, you can put them both on one.
- May I check your hat, sir?
- No, thanks.
- Want a drink?
- No, thanks.
- Come on, hurry up.
- Okay.
- Are you ready, Jean?
- Okay.
- Hello, Brad.
- How are you, Louise?
Hello, baby, how are you?
- Busy. Ever think of knocking?
- I never knock.
It does save getting splinters in your knuckles.
- Someday someone's gonna knock you flat.
- What are you doing tonight?
- I think I've got a date.
- With me?
- Nope. Brick Davis.
- Oh, is he here?
Yes.
- See you sometime.
- So long, Mac.
Don't hit any foul balls.
I'll try not to.
How are you?
- I heard something about you, lawyer.
- You did? What?
- That you're gonna be a big G-man.
- That's right.
- You ought to be dumped in a ditch.
- Keep your tin badge in Washington.
If you stick your puss in our affairs, you'll get a bellyful of this. Now beat it.
You made up your mind about that plant in Brooklyn?
Yep. I'm gonna sell it.
- Sell it?
- What do you mean?
- I'm gonna retire.
- What's gonna happen to us?
That's your affair.
You can take over and keep going if you want to, but you'd be suckers.
- This game is washed up.
- Yeah, maybe.
We're not gonna let the Mob bust up. There are plenty of rackets we can move into.
Not for me. I'm selling out.
- What if we don't want you to sell out?
- I sell out anyway.
I've spent all the time I want to trying to keep you guys in line.
From now on, you can run things to suit yourself.
If they catch up with you, it's your grief. I'm selling out.
- Does that make sense to you guys?
- Yeah, that makes sense.
- Hello, stranger.
- Oh, how are you, Jean?
Well, I feel fine. I was beginning to think I had the measles...
...the way you've been staying away.
- I've been awfully busy.
Yeah, I know.
That's the way it always happens.
Mac puts my name up in lights, and the only person I wanna see gets tangled up.
Don't you get eye strain reading law books?
Yeah, that's why I'm giving it all up.
I'm leaving for Washington tomorrow.
I just stopped in to see you.
- Got a law case down there?
- No, I'm closing the office.
I've joined the Department of Justice.
- Then you'll be staying there?
- Yeah, for a while anyway.
Well, that makes things different, doesn't it?
Yeah, a whole lot different.
You could almost call it a flying broad jump, couldn't you?
I just told Mac about it.
- What did he say?
- He thought it was a grand idea.
Well, I think it's swell, Brick, getting into work like that.
You'll like it a lot better than a law office.
Yeah, that's the way I feel about it.
I've gotta get going.
- Sorry you can't see the show.
- Yeah, so am I, but you understand.
Yeah. Goodbyes are sort of silly, aren't they?
- Yeah.
- Well, we can send you...
...a bulletproof vest for Christmas.
- Yeah. So long, kid.
Say, there's no rule that a G-man can't kiss an old friend goodbye, is there?
Get a comparison on those test bullets yet?
Just checking them.
You're out of luck, Jeff.
They don't match.
- Which one killed Buchanan?
- The one on the left.
I'll tell the chief.
- Morning.
- Morning.
The rifle we found isn't the one.
The slugs don't check.
The fingerprints on the handcuff match Durfee's.
Buchanan had him collared when he was killed.
Put that in your wire to the New York division.
- Report back here at 3:00.
- Yes, sir.
Let me go up to New York, chief.
I'd like a crack at this case.
No, I'm sending Smith up. I need you here in charge of training these new men.
- More law-school graduates?
- Three of them.
Oh, have a heart, chief. Give this grief to somebody else. I've been doing it for a year.
I made a decent record in the field for nine years.
Do I have to spend the rest of my life combing these kids out of my hair?
You're familiar with the work. And there aren't enough old hands to go around.
I'm the one should be yelling, not you.
We need those men. Lots of them.
I know. But why can't we get more guys with police experience?
Guys that know the underworld, not just how to spout law.
These kids have as much chance of pulling through a dangerous assignment...
...as Buchanan had.
That depends on how well you train them, Jeff.
That's your assignment. Go to it.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Davis is here, Mr. Gregory.
Yes, sir.
He says you're to report to Mr. McCord, the man who just left.
Thank you.
- Hello.
- Well, you look like...
...you're not going to New York.
- I'm not going.
I'm gonna keep on pounding the ABC's of crime...
...into the skulls of these babes-in-arms.
Law-school graduate. Law-school graduate. Law-school graduate.
Listen: Mr. James Davis, doctor of law, doctor of philosophy, Phi Beta Kappa.
Now, isn't that sweet?
- Phi Beta Kappa.
- What's yours, "Flatfooter Copper"?
Who said that? Who are you?
I'm Davis. But don't let that spoil your fun. Go right ahead.
So you're Mr. Davis.
- And you're McCord.
- That's right.
- And this is Mr. Farrell.
- Hiya.
- Hello.
- And we're not Phi Beta Kappas.
- No, I gathered that.
- A very funny remark.
Lay off him, Jeff.
He seems to be all right.
Sure, a perfect legal specimen.
But I don't think I like you,
Mr. Davis.
And I can't work up much of a sweat over that kisser of yours either.
However, my personal attitude will have no bearing on your advancement.
I think I'll take charge of your training personally.
There you go.
I don't want you to think I'm taking advantage of you in this...
...but the first requirement is an excellent physical condition.
Second, to know how to take care of yourself in a fight.
I've noticed that you lawyers talk most of your fights in court.
Now, the first is the balance.
Keep your feet wide apart...
...so that you won't be bowled over if somebody says "boo."
Like this.
So?
Very good. Now, the left lead.
Keep your right well up and guard my lead.
Well, keep it cocked. Keep it up there.
Keep the right hand high.
That's very, very good.
Now we'll trade rights.
You mean, like this.
Nice going, Brick.
Hey, he's a darn good lawyer.
- Yeah. How was that, better?
- That's fine, Davis. Fine.
Your leverages are practically the same as in wrestling.
- Hello, Jeff.
- Hi.
Jujitsu isn't hard to learn once you get used to the uses of the shifting balance.
Now, try those last two attacks
I showed you.
Watch out for yourself.
I'm gonna give you the works on defense.
- All right. Here we go.
- All right.
- I wasn't expecting that one.
- You'll get on to it.
- Now, try the second one.
- Second one?
Well...
...I'd like to try that one again.
- Sure. Come ahead.
Gee, I'm sorry, Davis.
I didn't mean to throw you off the mat.
Oh, that's all right.
Are you okay?
Listen, maybe you'd better call it a day...
...and go and wash up.
- Yeah.
That's kind of a good idea. Well...
...thanks for the workout.
- Not at all.
Hey, that kid can take it, Jeff.
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Very good.
Mr. Davis...
...you're next.
The noise may frighten you, but we want you to get used to it.
In case they change the laws so that government agents can carry guns.
Keep a stiff wrist.
The idea is to look along the barrel...
...and try and put the bullet somewhere near the dummies over there.
I see.
Like this?
That's it.
Would you mind reloading that?
I get a bit frightened.
Where did you learn to shoot?
I used to be marble champion of the Bronx.
What's the..?
- I'm awfully sorry.
- You should be.
No, I... I really am. So sorry.
- Are you waiting for someone?
- Obviously.
- Perhaps I can help you.
- No, thank you.
You're very welcome.
Are you waiting to see somebody?
Oh, pardon me for staring.
I'm studying character in faces...
...and I find yours interesting.
- So it appears.
Chin type number two.
"Does not make friends easily...
...and resents strangers."
Yeah, that's right.
"Eyes far apart indicates cruelty to animals.
The tendency of the skin to get purple with anger indicates high blood pressure...
...common among people with hot tempers."
What does it say about rifles and ammunition?
- "Most effective when used on offensive."
- Does it say how offensive?
Well, we...
We all look at things differently.
Jeff!
Hello, Kay.
- How are you?
- Just fine.
- Have a good trip down?
- Wonderful.
- I'm so glad to see you.
- Same here. Where's Hugh?
- He went to look for you.
- He met you at the station?
- I wanted to come myself.
- I know. Hugh told me.
Where have you been keeping yourself?
I'm sorry to keep you waiting...
...but this brother of yours jumps around like a grasshopper.
- Have you seen the apartment?
- I left my bags there. It's grand.
- Pretty good-looking for a graduate nurse.
- Oh, not bad.
And they advanced you to night supervisor?
I'm getting this vacation on full salary.
- Swell. You can buy our lunch. Come on.
- Well, I should say.
Extra! Federal bank truck robbed!
Half a million dollars!
Read all about the big robbery!
Two murdered by bank bandits!
Hop on these. They're the bullets that killed the bank truck guards.
Check them against all the gun-marking records.
Okay, Jeff.
Where did you get this?
From the right-hand front door of the car they did the shooting from.
Pull me the file on Twin Loops, B-6.
Fat chance those guards had.
Guy next to the driver had a shotgun and a rifle...
...and two guys in the back blazing at them with machine guns.
Twin Loops, B-6.
- Were there any marks on that car?
- Not one.
We traced the license, but it was stolen.
Oh, yes, there was one clue:
A mashed flower on the floor of the front seat, a gardenia.
A gardenia?
- Yes, a gardenia.
- On the side where the man...
...with the shotgun was sitting?
- That's right, hawkshaw.
See if you have prints on Danny Leggett, a New York gangster. Please, a hunch.
They might check up with this one.
Find out if we got any prints on Danny Leggett, a New York gangster.
- Yes, let me have them.
- You're marvelous.
All you have to do is hear about a gardenia, and out of 4 million prints...
...you pick the right one, just like that. What a detective.
So nice to have you realize it.
Prints on Leggett. New York record.
Thanks, Joe.
Well, we'll see how good you are.
It's a long shot.
Four million to one.
Ought to be a cinch. I'm dying.
Almost too good to be true.
He's right, Jeff. Leggett's your man.
Don't you think you better run along and tell Gregory, Mr. McCord?
Wait a minute, Davis.
How do you know so much about this Leggett?
We were raised together on the
East Side in the same neighborhood.
- An East Side mug with a gardenia?
- Yeah.
- What?
- He always wears one. It's a superstition.
- Did you find anything?
- I'll say I did.
This rifle bullet is the same as the one that killed Buchanan.
- Yeah?
- Positive check, same rifle.
That means Leggett.
He used it in the bank robbery.
Yeah, but that's no proof he's the one who used it on Buchanan.
No, but I know how to get him and find out.
- Let me go to New York.
- Forget it. You haven't finished your course.
- But you can recommend me.
- Well, I'm not going to. You're not ready.
Then you won't do it because you don't like me. You never have.
But you're not man enough to say so.
If Leggett killed Buchanan, I want him.
I'm going over your head, McCord.
I'm going to ask Gregory myself.
McCord is right, Davis, and personal differences have nothing to do with it.
We have definite rules governing procedure here, and we stick to them.
- Yes, sir.
- I wouldn't send you or any other new man.
Farrell has this assignment. You'll have your chance when you're ready for it.
That's all, Davis.
Thank you, sir.
I'm not going to assign you to New York.
That would tie you up in case Leggett gets across any state lines.
You'll be assigned to the district where you find him.
I want only one thing:
- Get him.
- Yes, sir.
- Good luck.
- Thank you, sir.
- See you at the airport, Jeff.
- Right.
- Well, I hope you get him, Farrell.
- Thanks.
You wanted this assignment bad, didn't you?
Yeah. Buchanan and I were close friends.
I'll remember that.
You might keep an eye on the flower shops.
Leggett buys a gardenia every day.
- Thanks, Davis.
- Oh, and...
...watch that derby of his.
He doesn't wear a hard hat for nothing.
- I'll remember that too.
- Good luck.
- Well, how do you do, Miss McCord?
- Oh, it's you.
Yeah. My name's Davis.
So you're Mr. Davis.
- You've heard of me?
- My brother mentioned you.
- Oh, yes. We're good friends.
- Didn't sound like that to me.
You mustn't mind him, he's a great kidder.
You know, you're looking better today.
- You've lost that purple angry look.
- I'm glad to hear it.
- I was worried about you.
- About me? Why?
Well, we can't discuss that here.
- Couldn't I see you this evening?
- No, I'm leaving for Chicago tonight.
Well, that's too bad.
Just what did you want to talk to me about?
Why, I might like to have a picture of you.
- Did you think I'd give you one?
- Wouldn't you?
- No.
- Well, I just thought I'd ask.
- Are you as nice to everybody you hate?
- Yes. And they don't get pictures.
Well, thanks for letting me have it.
- I said I wouldn't give you one.
- But you have.
Hey, Davis, telegram for you.
Oh, thanks.
- Mac!
- Brick, come on in.
Well, gee, I'm glad to see you.
- I'm glad to see you.
- Come on. Sit down.
What a surprise. Tell me, what are you doing here?
Me? I'm heading west.
"Joseph Lynch" and "heading west"?
What..?
I didn't want anybody to connect you with me, get you in a jam.
- Oh, yeah.
- Well, how you getting along?
Fine, fine. I just finished my training course.
- Never mind about me, what are you doing?
- I'm in the hotel business.
- You, in the hotel business?
- Yeah.
- Thanks.
- I bought a summer place up in Wisconsin.
It's called Pinecrest.
Fishing, tourists...
- And mosquitoes.
- Yeah, mosquitoes. All that kind of thing.
- Well, what about New York?
- I sold everything out. I'm gonna forget it.
- And you threw the Mob overboard?
- Yep.
Well, I'm still looking for Leggett.
- Wanna tell me anything?
- You wouldn't want me to, would you?
No. Forget it.
You know, I can't play ball with either side.
I'm kind of sitting on top of the fence.
Swell place to spend a nice quiet life, but rather dull.
- Yeah.
- What about Jean?
I don't know. She kind of dropped out of sight after I closed the cabaret.
- I haven't seen her in months.
- I'd like to see her. A swell kid.
- Yeah.
- Board!
Well, that's me.
Guess I've gotta shove off.
I just wanted to tell you, if you get out west, come look the place over.
- I'll give you a real blowout.
- Sold.
It's a date. I'm glad you let me know you were passing through.
I just wanted to check on how you're getting on.
- I'll see you sometime.
- You bet you will. I'll see to that.
- Bye, Mac.
- Goodbye.
- You send for me?
- Yes. Just making out a report on you.
Before I send it to Gregory, I want the right answers to some questions.
- Riding me again?
- If I am, it's for the last time.
You've been making a few slips,
I've been checking up on you.
- What are you trying to get away with?
- Nothing.
Then why did you falsify your personal history in your entrance papers?
I didn't. There's not one false statement in those papers.
They've been checked and passed.
You can't nail me on that, McCord.
I've told them everything.
Runaway from the orphanage, arrests for vagrancy and fighting, law school, all of it.
All but the one thing you knew would keep you out of here...
...and I've just uncovered it.
You've been hooked up with a big bootleg outfit in New York.
The leader paid your way through law school, undercover.
Set you up in law business. A very smart way for a Mob to get a stool pigeon...
...in the Department of Justice.
- That's a lie.
- The same Mob that Leggett's in.
No wonder you could tell us all you knew about him.
It didn't hurt McKay, and it got you in here solid.
McKay had absolutely nothing to do with my coming here.
And once more,
I've never worked for him!
I haven't seen him or been in contact with him for months!
Well, until...
Go on.
Until you reported to him on the 3:45 train, drawing room A.
You've been under observation for a week, Davis.
Well, I guess that takes care of everything.
You can break me out of the service with that.
Yeah.
That seems to be what you want.
You've been riding me for a long time...
...but I'll give you some straight answers.
- Go ahead.
- I'll tell you about McKay.
I was a gutter rat when he found me...
...and would probably still be one if it hadn't been for him.
He gave me a chance to go straight, do the right thing. I took it.
But he's never asked anything of me.
- Why did you join the department?
- Because of Buchanan.
Buchanan was my friend.
He was my roommate at college.
And I wanted to get the guy who killed him.
McCord, I studied law because I wanted to work for the law...
...and for no other reason.
Now, I've taken an awful lot from you since I've been here...
...and you're the last man I'd ask anything of unless it meant a great deal to me.
The service does.
Please don't kick me out.
- Thanks.
- Thanks, nothing!
Make one more fake pass, and out you go for good!
- You know the ropes around here, huh?
- Yeah, I made some contacts.
- Collins come out with you?
- No, he'll join us in about a month.
- Any of the rest of the Mob come out?
- Six of them.
They got a hideout in Kansas City.
- I got one here in case you need it.
- Probably will.
We figured on staying around for a while.
Thinking of opening up a bank.
Maybe a couple of them.
- Nice country around here.
- Yeah, I was thinking that myself.
Calling all cars. Attention, all cars.
Be on the lookout for a man identified as Leggett...
...heading west on Highway 66.
You sure this is the place?
The second cabin.
He buy gardenia from me...
Yeah, yeah, sure. I know all about that.
Come on, boys.
- Tony, you stay here. All right.
- Yes, sir.
- Stick them up!
- Not this time, Leggett.
Come on, get up.
Move it.
Put your gun up, copper.
You're not gonna get hurt.
I wish I could use it on you,
I'd save the state a lot of money.
Come on, Leggett. Get into your coat.
Too bad you didn't have that on when it happened.
Who told you about that?
Oh, a friend of mine.
Come on, get going.
- They've got Danny.
- Wait a minute. There's too many of them.
We'd better get the Mob. Go on, scram.
I don't know anything about it.
- You killed Buchanan.
- You're crazy.
You used the same gun to kill that bank guard.
Oh, save your breath.
You'll talk when you get inside that jail.
- You won't keep me in any jail.
- No? We'll see.
Yeah. We'll see.
- Paper!
- Tonight's final!
- Paper here!
- Tonight's final!
- Hello, chief.
- How are you?
- Car ready, Al?
- We've got two of them.
Okay. Let's go.
Paper. Paper. Tonight's final.
Get readied up. They're here.
Come on, let's go.
Up, coppers, up!
Leggett! The car's across the street!
Scram!
The state police cannot combat these criminals.
Neither can city police.
The law prohibits them from pursuing criminals across the state line.
With the automobile and airplane...
...these gangs can get from state to state in a few hours.
The Department of Justice is handicapped.
When Hugh Farrell died in that slaughter...
...he didn't even have a gun to defend himself.
A federal agent is not permitted to have a gun.
He can't even make an arrest without first obtaining a local warrant.
Gentlemen, give us national laws with teeth in them...
...covering the whole field of interstate crime.
Permit us to work to full effect with the state police agencies...
...and these gangs will be wiped out.
What laws do you need most?
Make bank robbery and kidnapping federal crimes.
Make it a federal crime to kill a government agent...
...or to flee across a state line to avoid arrest...
...or to avoid testifying as a witness.
Arm your agents.
And not just with revolvers.
If these gangsters wanna use machine guns...
...then give your special agents machine guns, shotguns, tear gas.
Everything else. This is war!
Now, understand, I don't wanna make them a group of quick-trigger men...
...but I do want the underworld to know that when a federal agent draws his gun...
...he's ready and equipped to shoot to kill with the least possible waste of bullets.
I know how you feel about Hugh, Jeff, and I've decided to let you take over.
You're giving me his assignment?
I'm putting you in charge of the Chicago office.
This list is to be posted in all districts...
...and not to come down until every name on it is accounted for.
More will be added. Take the plane.
I'm assigning five agents to go with you.
- You pick your own men and let me know.
- Yes, sir.
Send Davis in. And tell Henderson to report here at once.
Yes, I wanna talk to you.
You've been yelling for months for action.
We'll see how your nerves stand up under fire.
You're assigned to Chicago.
Be at the airport at 4:00.
Now, go on home and get packed.
It's part of the money taken in that
East Chicago bank robbery.
- How much did you get?
- Two $20 bills.
Their serial numbers check with the list you gave us.
- Who banked them?
- J.E. Blattner.
Here's the deposit slip and the address.
"J.E. Blattner, 43..."
- When did you get them?
- One last night. The other four days ago.
I didn't know it was hot dough, honest.
I'm on the level.
- Never mind that, who gave them to you?
- I don't know him.
- What'd he look like?
- Oh, medium size.
Black hair. He's a swell dresser.
That's all I know...
- Buys a flower every day?
- Yeah, a gardenia.
- He buys lots.
- All with $20 bills?
Yeah. He always carries a roll.
All right, that's all.
Keep your mouth shut.
You bet. I don't wanna get tangled up with you G-guys.
- So long.
- So long.
Hold your fire!
I've been waiting for this.
Come on. On your feet.
On your feet.
Yeah.
He's taking a shower.
Any message?
There ain't any shower there, copper.
- I'll bet that was Collins.
- Yeah? Get him out of here.
I can't help it. Every time I see you,
I wonder if it's gonna be the last.
Now, listen. There's no sense in you reading the papers...
...and then coming down here all in an uproar. I'm all right.
- I'll keep on being all right.
- That's what Hugh said.
- He never had a chance.
- I know.
But he didn't have a gun either.
Those guys don't like it now that we're able to give them a dose of their own medicine.
You should have seen the way Davis manhandled this Leggett.
- I'm not interested in Davis.
- Yeah, well, it was a sweet job.
- But don't tell him I said so.
- Don't worry, I won't.
I don't even wanna talk to him.
- You're beginning to like him, aren't you?
- No, I'm not.
And I wish you'd keep him away from the hospital too.
- Do you mean to say he's been up there?
- Yes, he has.
He said he wanted to look over the rooms in case he ever got sick.
Excuse me. There's a man here wants to see you.
- Says it's important.
- Who is it?
- He won't say.
- All right.
Wait outside, will you, Kay?
What do you want?
- Well, I got a message for you.
- All right, go ahead.
Do you guarantee not to arrest me?
Oh, that kind, eh?
I promise you nothing.
What have you got to say?
The paper says youse guys is gonna take
Leggett down to the state pen tomorrow...
...keep him there till his trial, right?
- Yeah. That's right.
Well, Gerard says...
...to tell you G-guys if you stick your nose out trying to take him to the pen...
...there'll be another massacre.
And doubles.
- He said that, did he?
- Yeah.
Well, you go back and tell Gerard...
...that I've decided to talk Leggett to the pen myself.
Tell him I'll leave here with him at 7:15 tomorrow morning.
I'll go to the station by car, take the 7:40 train...
...and then a car to the prison.
Tell him I'll be alone.
And if he's looking for trouble, he can have it at any of those times and places.
Get out!
- You can't do that, Jeff. They'll kill you.
- Nonsense.
- You can't take chances like that.
- Forget it.
Think I'm gonna let that Mob get away with sending their orders into this office?
They're not playing with a bunch of helpless bank tellers.
The sooner they learn that, the better.
We're gonna make the word "government" poison to them if it's the last thing we do.
What does that matter to me?
I... I can't lose you, Jeff.
You can I are alone, and I haven't got anybody.
There, there.
You're not going to lose me.
Oh, come on, sis.
You don't know what this is all about.
You go back to your hospital and help take care of all those cromos with the mumps.
What's the matter?
It's Jeff. He can't go through with it.
He'll get killed.
- Oh, I wouldn't say that.
- Oh, please don't let him do it.
He's gonna try and take Leggett to prison alone. You can stop him. Please!
Now, you mustn't worry about that.
He'll do it beautifully.
Now, you keep your little head right there, and...
Get going.
Nice prison.
Too bad your Mob didn't keep their promise.
You won't live long, McCord.
Step on it, driver.
Sit tight, Leggett.
If they start something, remember, you get it first.
Watch that car.
Are they dumb enough to think they can get you here?
Get him inside.
Hello.
What's the idea of trailing me?
Just wanted to see if you could get here.
Any report from Division L?
Yeah, there's no trace of Collins or Gerard.
It looks as though the Mob has disappeared.
- They've got a great hideout, wherever it is.
- I'll say they have.
Unless you fellas have been taking a vacation for two weeks.
You haven't had an attack of brilliance lately. Why don't you try guessing?
They're in that circle somewhere.
Only six states.
We've got them cornered.
Cut out the wisecracks.
What time did that..?
- Any luck?
- We found Collins' wife.
- Where is she?
- Outside. Wanna question her?
I'll say I do.
Bring her in, Bill.
Sit down.
- We located the apartment he rented.
- The boys have been drinking varnish.
- The landlady identifies her as Mrs. Grover.
- She's crazy.
She identifies her as Mrs. Grover.
That's the name they've been using.
You're lucky that's all you heard.
You should hear her tell about the tenants in 106.
Cut out the funny stuff. Where's Collins?
- You frighten me.
- Answer the question.
I haven't the slightest idea.
He's just a friend.
I dropped in and he wasn't there.
These gentlemen were.
They looked at me and I looked at them.
They invited me down here and here we are.
Now, are you happy?
Or shall I tell you about my operation?
- Gonna keep on stalling, eh?
- You are so bright.
McCord, I'd like to speak to you for a moment.
We won't get anywhere that way.
Let me have a few minutes alone with her.
- Why do you think you can get her to talk?
- I know her.
Come on out, guys.
No reason why old friends shouldn't shake hands.
Thanks for calling off the wolf.
Funny meeting this way, isn't it?
Yeah. Not even a floor show.
Tell me, why did you marry him?
Why not?
Oh, yeah, I know, but why Collins?
Brad's always been pretty swell to me.
I've been happy.
Oh, now, come on, don't give me that.
- Let's stop the kidding.
- I'm not kidding.
All right.
When did you see him last?
You heard me tell them. A month ago.
- I didn't expect you to tell the truth.
- Then why ask me?
Because I can't understand protecting that guy.
You know what he is and what he's done.
You know that since he's been out here he's killed two officers in cold blood.
And you tell me you've been happy with him?
No, I'm not.
When I read that, I decided to quit.
I'm not going back to him.
There, that's better.
When did you marry him?
A couple of months after the cabaret closed.
And you never told McKay?
He's one person I didn't want to know about it.
He'll probably learn it from Brad, though.
He'll learn it from Brad?
- Is Collins with McKay?
- No.
- He's hiding out at McKay's lodge!
- I never told you that!
- Brick! Brick, you can't!
- You wait there.
- Well?
- Collins is hiding...
...at McKay's summer hotel in Pinecrest.
- Gerard and the rest are probably with him.
- I thought you said McKay quit.
- I did, but...
- Drake, pick seven more men.
Get guns for all of them.
Martin, call the police at Pinecrest.
Ask them to have three cars waiting.
- Get a transport plane.
- Right.
I could go for this north woods stuff.
- It does something to you.
- You're telling me.
The idea of Mac trying to keep us out of here.
- Say, I thought you said he was a pal.
- Sure, he is. But he's a bad host.
Imagine him calling this poison good liquor.
He don't even like it himself.
Give us a speech, Mac, and tell the girls what a big shot you used to be.
Go on, talk!
You wouldn't like what I have to say.
Closed for the season.
We'd better stop here.
There it is.
Get to the positions you were assigned on that map.
Davis, you watch the side door.
I've got 12:17. Five minutes will give you time to get around the back.
When we're ready to crash in,
I'll fire two shots.
You fellas go through those windows and doors, and go fast. All right.
Come on, let's see if you can still stand on those heels.
Excuse us, will you, Mr. McKay?
Say, what's that?
- They've spotted us.
- No use waiting.
Come on! We gotta move!
We might as well quit.
We're not hitting anything.
Keep that gun working!
Keep them in the woods!
Give me noise! Give me lots of noise!
Come on.
- We can't make it this way!
- Side door's nearer to the cars.
Okay!
You've gotta help us out of here!
Shut up! Get upstairs and lay low.
We gotta make a run for it.
Give them the tear gas.
Tear gas!
Gas!
Come on, we gotta make a break for the cars!
- Who's going out and take it first, you?
- No, none of us.
Come on, Big Shot.
You're big enough to be a good shield.
Mac!
- Hello, Brick.
- Mac, I didn't know it was you.
It wasn't your fault.
You're okay, kid.
Funny, I was thinking about you the other day...
...wondering when you were coming up for that...
Oh, Mac.
- Nice work tonight, Brick.
- Road between here and Chicago is blocked.
What's the idea?
I'm washed up.
I'll mail my resignation in to the Chicago office tomorrow.
Davis.
One time you told me I was the last guy...
...you'd ever beg anything from unless it meant something to you. Remember that?
- Yeah.
- Personally, that goes double with me.
But I'm talking to you now as the head of this division.
I don't wanna report you as the first guy that left this service...
...before his job was finished.
That time it meant something to you to stay.
Now it means something to me to have you stay.
Oh, I know how you feel about McKay.
I'd feel the same way in your spot, but you didn't kill him.
Those rats could have left him inside.
They murdered him when they forced him out.
And Collins got away with it.
Think it over.
- Who is it?
- Brad. Open up.
What's the idea of moving?
I was afraid they'd find me.
They were looking everywhere for you.
I'll say they were looking.
They raided the lodge and knocked over everybody but me.
I know, I read the papers.
You got away.
Well, what are you staring about?
You don't look very glad about it.
Oh, I am, Brad.
But, gee, I've been scared to death.
- That's why I didn't leave word.
- I'll say you didn't.
I had to trace you through the trucking outfit that moved your stuff.
I'd still like to know how those coppers found us up there.
- They didn't get to you, did they?
- Oh, no. No, I've been safe here.
Yeah, sure.
You're a smart kid.
I just got the jumps.
Forget it. Crack open a bottle of whiskey and we'll celebrate.
There isn't any in the house.
Well, beat it down to the store and get some.
- And get me some cigarettes, will you?
- All right.
- You'll find some food in the icebox.
- Okay.
He may be doubling back now.
- I wanna warn Jean.
- I wanna ask her a few questions myself.
- All highways, driving black touring car.
License 391284.
Collins escaped from apartment house at 2934 Modena.
Collins in Chicago? Okay, Burns.
Collins driving black touring car.
License 391284.
- Oh, hello, Brad.
- Get rid of that car, it's hot.
- Where you going?
- Oh, hello, Jeff.
- Why, I... I heard that Mr. Davis was here.
- Mr. Davis, huh?
- Was he badly hurt?
- Nothing serious.
They took one slug out of his chest and another creased his skull.
There's nothing to worry about.
He's squawking about having to stay.
- I gotta beat it, kid.
- Jeff?
- How'd he get shot?
- Wait a minute.
He did it saving my life, and he showed a lot of nerve doing it too.
He's a great guy, Kay.
But don't tell him I said so.
- Are you sure you're all right?
- Yeah, sure, fine. He just winged me.
If I'd come out a few minutes later,
I'd have seen you. I could have warned you.
No, you did the right thing getting out of there as fast you could.
Come in.
- Oh, I... I'm sorry.
- Oh, please don't go. Come in.
- Miss Morgan, Miss McCord.
- How do you do?
Hello.
I heard what happened. I wanted to thank you for saving Jeff's life.
Oh, it wasn't much.
We had a lucky break, that's all.
Did he tell you that?
No.
I wondered.
- Are you all right?
- Oh, yes, I'm fine.
Well, I won't intrude any longer.
- Good night, Miss Morgan.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Well, I think I better go and let you get some sleep.
All right, Jean.
Don't go back to that apartment.
- You can't afford to take any chances.
- It was swell of you to try to help me, Brick.
- I was a little bit late.
- Yes, but it makes things different.
I used to think that at least
I owed loyalty to Brad...
...but I realize now
I don't owe him anything.
He's done enough harm without doing any more.
Wait a minute. What do you mean?
- I think I know where to find him.
- No, don't try it. Stay away from him!
Good night, Brick.
- Got the guns?
- He'll have them in the shop.
You can get them at 2:00.
You'll need them.
McCord and his G-men are knocking every place in town.
- They're gunning for you.
- They are?
They'll make somebody talk.
When they do, they'll be down here quick.
- You better duck for Canada.
- Yeah.
- They'll blockade the roads.
- Don't worry about that.
I got a way of making McCord call off his dogs. Open that door.
Want me to phone if Mr. Davis starts running a temperature?
You stay away from him.
He'll be better with the doctor.
- Thanks. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Miss McCord.
- Yes?
- Get in that sedan.
Get in that sedan.
Yeah, this is Collins. And you can tell
McCord to get all patrols off the highways.
I've got his sister! And if they try to stop me, I'll dump her into their laps.
And she won't be talking.
Calling car 121. Car 121.
Urgent. To Special Agent McCord.
Special Agent McCord.
Collins has kidnapped your sister.
Threatens to kill her
if attempt made to capture.
Don't get impatient, baby.
He won't be gone long.
Oh, hiya, Mrs. Collins. Come on in.
- I'm looking for Brad. Have you seen him?
- Yeah, he was here.
He'll be back pretty soon.
Say, you sure were lucky getting out just before the cops jumped him.
- He told you?
- Yeah.
Close, wasn't it?
- Who's the dame?
- That? That's the G-guy's sister.
They got the heat on Brad, but they'll lay off...
...when they find out he's liable to bump this chicken.
- Lose all your guns at the lodge?
- Yeah.
Well, it was a good hideout.
Too bad the cops got hold of your wife.
- What are you talking about?
- Didn't you know?
- No, I didn't.
- Why, it's a cinch she spilled it.
They had her at government headquarters the morning before they raided you.
Thanks.
What's the idea of leaving?
He's coming soon.
I know. I'll be right back.
I wanna get a few things.
- I'm going with him.
- That's up to you.
Oh, hello there, good-looking.
- Your wife was just here.
- When?
She just left a few minutes ago.
- She see the dame?
- Sure. She said she's going with you.
She's gonna rat to the cops.
Which way did she go?
Well, that way.
Wait!
Come on back, they'll get you!
You got time to get away!
You can't make it!
- Did a dame go by here?
- One just went in the lunchroom.
Hello, General Hospital?
Brick Davis, please. Hurry.
- Hello, Brick? Jean. I found him.
- At it again, huh?
Police!
Operator, where's that receiver down?
Wait a minute, Mr. Davis.
You can't get up yet.
- You can't get up yet!
- Shut up and get my clothes!
Look here, Mr. Davis.
You can't leave here.
There she is, in there.
- Special agent.
- Yes, sir.
- How is she?
- I don't think she has a chance.
Jean.
Jean.
Brick.
You've got to get there. Garage.
809 Allen Street.
Brad's got the McCord girl in his car.
Collins has Kay?
He's gonna try to get to Canada.
You've got to get there first.
I wouldn't make her talk too much.
I'll see you later.
I won't be around.
Sure you will.
Say...
...there's no rule that says a G-man...
...can't kiss an old friend goodbye, is there?
Hello, police headquarters?
Special Agent Davis speaking.
Yeah, I've located Collins.
In a garage, 809 Allen Street.
809. Yeah, send cars.
He's holding Chief McCord's sister.
I'm going there now. Hurry!
Calling all cars, Division Six.
All cars, Division Six.
Collins located, 809 Allen Street.
809 Allen Street. A garage.
- Come on, step on it!
- Better give them time to clear the roads.
Down.
Come on, copper.
Are you gonna let her have it...
...or am I? Come on, copper!
Come on out and get it.
- You all right?
- Did you get him?
- Yeah, where's Kay?
- Inside.
- Is she all right?
- She's all right.
- Did they get him?
- Yes, with a machine gun.
- He crashed into a building down the street.
- Kay.
- Are you okay, kid?
- I'm all right. But where's Brick?
Oh, Jeff, he was wonderful.
- Thanks, Davis.
- A pleasure.
Don't you think you better be getting back to the hospital?
Yeah, I guess that's a good idea.
- I'm going with him.
- Take good care of him, sis.
He's a great guy.
Shall I tell him you said so?
Yeah.
- How you feeling, Brick?
- Fine.
- Take care of yourself, Brick.
- Thanks.
I'm going over to get the car.
I'm gonna handle your case personally.
It's gonna be nice having a nurse in the family.
I dare say, you wish you'd never left Versailles.
You had a very pleasant time at court...
...with those gallant young officers.
With one in particular, I recall.
Why have we come here?
For YOUR sake. my love!
In order that you may have a husband...
....who IS a husband...
...and not just an invalid!
I'll soon be well...
Three months at the baths should cure me.
Welcome to the Chateau de Résance your Excellency.
At last!
Help me, help me, someone...
This coach is an infernal rack!
That's it... steady... easy...
Easy!
Easy! Dolts! Easy!
Easy... easy!
Your Excellency need not bother with the stairs...
We will prepare a room on the ground floor.
How far is it to the baths?
About an hour's drive.
I'll go the first thing in the morning.
Thank you, your Excellency.
A fine way to spend a honeymoon!
You'll find the days rather long, I'm afraid.
The time will pass.
They've sent for a maid.
Not necessary... I'm quite capable.
My dear...
You may be capable... as the daughter of a Scottish merchant... in Leghorn...
But as Madame la Marquise de Vincitata...
...wife of a grandee of Spain...
...who is envoy to the King of France...
At all times!
Yes, your Excellency.
There!...
You must be tired.
Don't let ME keep you any longer.
Good night, your Excellency.
Good night, Maria.
At what hour will we leave for the baths, your Excellency?
Eight!
Denis...
Dear Denis...
Oh, Merciful Mother... help me to forget him.
Madame...
Yes?
My name is Lucia, madame...
I am the new maid.
What time is it?
It's scarcely daybreak...
But I was told it was a matter of life and death.
- Who gave you this?  - The cook's sister.
- And she?   - Don't worry, madame...
She told me to tell you...
...that she can hold her tongue.
And the rest of the servants are asleep.
Madame...
If there is any way in which I can help...
"By the mill at the first bridge".
Denis!
Maria!
Oh, I never dreamt you'd come!
How could it be otherwise?
But here is so far...
Ten days from Paris!
Oh, darling, what's going to happen to us?
- I do love you... I do!    - Dearest!
These are for always.
Always!
And you WILL take me away from him?
- Yes, I swear it!   - When?
You must trust me, my dear...
It will take planning...
Your husb...
The Marquis has powerful friends...
It would never do to fail.
First, I must go back to Paris.
Back to Paris?!
We'll need money, if we're to get out of France.
Besides, I'm an officer...
I can't desert.
I'd have to resign my commission.
Denis, I'm frightened!
Let's not think of it now, dearest...
We've many days to talk it over.
Meanwhile...
We mustn't wait too long.
In 2 or 3 months, he'll be well, and...
Madame...
He's back from the baths.
Tomorrow?
Provide he isn't home...
I'll get a message to you somehow.
Au revoir, dearest.
You've made extraordinary progress in 3 months, monsieur.
In few days... you'll be able to continue your honeymoon.
That's a nice way to put it, doctor!
But the truth is...
My honeymoon has never quite started!
And to think you've been all the way to Paris!
- Did you miss me?   - Oh, darling!
What is it, Maria?... You're frightened!
You're trembling!
Can't you guess?
I'm yours now... All yours!
Oh, my dearest!
We must leave at once... Tonight!
What if Don Luis returns?
He's been staying at the baths lately...
But I know he's ever so much better...
I'll watch for your signal.
One candle if I can go...
Two, if I can't.
And if you're in trouble my dear...
If anything should happen...
Then, I'll light three!
Dearest!
Rejoice, my dear!
Your husband is complete again!
I shan't say good night...
Dismiss your maid, when you've retired.
Did you hear someone running about?
Yes, master!
What does this mean?
Come here!
No!
What name?!
His name?!
Denis!
You...
...a merchant's daughter!
To soil the honour of my name!
The world will never know...
Do you hear me?!  Never!
That I vow!
There was no message, monsieur.
They left early this morning...
...bag and baggage.
Madame too?
Madame, the maid, the marquis...
Which way did they go?
By the road to Issoire.
Thank you.
I'm looking for a coach...
A large coach... with a bearded man and two women.
It's here... came a little while ago.
When her supper comes...
...serve it quickly...
We may leave very soon.
Did you know my dear that I have the reputation of being one of the best swordsman in Europe.
However, it's too late to think of that,
I'm afraid.
And he's so tired, poor boy...
So tired!... So worried!
Not in the house, please...
You are quick, m'sieur!
Quick to betray... quick to dishonour!
He's clumsy...
He can't harm the young man.
Denis!
Order the coach Sancho...
We'll continue our journey at once.
Poor boy!
Open up!
Who are you?
Never mind who we are...
Give her money, and hold your tongue.
Oh, m'lord!
It's come, master!
It's come... It's a boy!
Alive?!
Drive on, Sancho!
I thought you were in Paris.
Where's Maria?
Didn't you bring her?
I want to speak to your master.
I see... I'm just a servant...
Well, I'm not Maria's maid any longer.
I'm her father's housekeeper.
And his heiress, too, perhaps!
Who knows?
If you'll keep his house... well!
Isn't he a darling?!
Poor little fellow!
I respect your feelings, sisters...
In fact, I share them!
But this is a girl's school...
The child must be disposed of.
Well...
I'll speak to Father Xavier in the morning.
He isn't an ordinary foundling...
A satin cloak... a purse of gold...
A male child cannot be reared in a school for little girls.
Oh, Sister...
This is St Anthony's feast day, too.
Sister, we implore you!
You may rest assured...
Everything was done, that could be done.
Buried in the The Alps!
Maria... my only child!
And the baby was buried, too.
Maria, and the infant.
Both of them.
You understand?
Aye!
It's hard to be the bearer of such news.
For a husband, especially.
My little girl!
Her bonny soul's at peace.
If you'll pardon my mentioning it, at this time...
There's just one other matter while I'm here in Leghorn...
Your lease on this property is about to expire.
If it suits you...
I'd be glad to renew it on the same terms...
...for as many years as you choose.
Thank you, señor.
I shall want to keep it.
It's where my daughter grew up.
Au revoir, señor.
Gone!
No trace of her!
Nothing!
Nothing left!
Nothing.
But you're a great merchant!
You still have your work, your ships!
Aye!
But for whom?
Anthony...
AN-thony!
Daydreaming?!
Father...
Could I go for a walk outside the walls?
When school is closed for summer, you may...
But not before.
I want to go now!
Oh...do you?!
And how do you think it would look...
...to see a great big boy like you...
...going in and out of a girls' convent.
Mother Marie-José would be very angry.
But she has REAL people to talk to.
I have no one.
No one?
Only YOU.
Pardon me, Father.
Have you read your lesson?
We shall see!
Quid proxima...
 quid superiore...
nocte egeris...
ubi fueris, quos convo-cheris...
"quos conVOCAVEris"!
quid consili ceperis...
quid nostra...
quem nostrum ignorare arbitraris.
Arbitraris?
What we did last night... what you did the night before... where you were... whom you called together... what plans you made.
Whom of us do you think is ignorant of these things?
Now continue.
O tempora, o mores!
"Alas for the times...alas for its..."
It's...?
Mores...morals.
An important word, Anthony...
You should never forget it.
Why not?
Because morals are the foundation of a man's soul.
With bad morals...
..a man is dishonest, ungodly.
And his house soon decays to the ground.
But the man with good morals...
...lives in honour and truth...
...and builds for himself a great and beautiful mansion...
...that lives for all eternity...
...through his children and his children's children.
Someday I'm going to have a great and beautiful mansion.
It'll have towers so high...
...that I can see the whole world.
And it'll have a...
Father Xavier...
Sister Marie-José wishes to see you.
Thank you, sister.
Quem nostrum ignorare arbitraris?
That's a question!
Be sure you make it one.
You'll meet plenty of others.
Sister Ursula...
Later, my dear...
Sister Ursula is very busy now.
You can have it!
Oh, how sweet...
I couldn't make out what it was.
I have pigeons, too.
And I. I have a rabbit.
A rabbit?
His name is Oliver Cromwell.
You see, we're English.
What are you?
Is everybody something?
Of course!
What are rabbits?
Silly! They don't count!
But they're alive, aren't they?
Certainly... Everybody knows that!
I don't. I've never seen one.
I can't keep Anthony much longer, Father.
We'll have to place him.
Look!
My tall hat.
The scoundrel! Who is the other child?
Florence Udney...
The daughter of the British consul at Leghorn.
Father...
We must find him a place immediately.
Why in a few years...
...we'll send him to Rome to study...
Can't we wait until then?
No... this is a girls' school...
I've no place for a boy of 10.
He's such a child!
It's no use arguing Father...
I've made up my mind.
I'm sure there's someone to take him...
...right here in Leghorn.
A merchant, for instance...
There are several in the British colony.
Isn't he rather young to be apprenticed?
It's never too young to learn a trade.
Particularly for an orphan.
Well... have you any suggestions?
Perhaps Martin and Forsyth may take him.
They're very prominent.
What about the Casa da Bonnyfeather?
Mr Bonnyfeather is a good churchman.
He's been very lonesome since his daughter died.
Well, then... let it be...
The Casa da Bonnyfeather.
Yes...Casa da Bonnyfeather.
Look!
Please tell Mr Bonnyfeather that Father Xavier has arrived.
He's expecting us.
Yes, Father... please go sit down.
Dear me!
Here... there you are.
Alright, Father.
Wait here, Anthony.
Father!
You've brought him?
Bag and all!
He comes to you, exactly as he came to us!
Including the 10 gold pieces.
10 gold pieces!
That's a goodly fortune for a lad his age!
He hasn't any clothes, though.
Cut that, man... we'll soon fix that!
Here... give me the receipt.
I'll sign it now.
Thank you.
Buried in The Alps...
I'm sorry, father.
For a moment, the child reminded me of my daughter.
Bring him into the study.
Anthony... come and meet your benefactor.
How do you do, young man?!
Do you think you'll like it here?
I can't tell yet, Signore.
That's alright!
Be frank, and we'll get along fine!
May God bless you for this deed, Mr Bonnyfeather.
Thank you Father...
We'll take good care of him...
Never fear!
Goodbye, Anthony.
I want to stay with YOU, Father!
This is where you commence your future, Anthony.
You must have courage.
Come... we'll look for some clothes for you.
Guessippi...
Ah...signora...
Oh, the kitchen's so big!
And there's the cook...Signora Guessippi
We built the kitchen around her!
Signora... this is Master Anthony...
...our new apprentice.
He's in need of clothes... temporarily.
Perhaps you could spare a shirt from one of your children.
It'll be done, Signore.
Who's the little girl?
That's Angela, her daughter.
Angela...
Say hello to the little gentleman.
Hello!
May I play with Angela, Sr Bonnyfeather?
Young man, you're here to work...
You've lots to learn!
I beg your pardon, sir.
Of course you may play with Angela...
Whenever you like!
Oh, thank you, sir!
And now, master Anthony, we'll go upstairs...
...and find a room you can sleep in.
I'll search for the clothes right away, Signore!
Angela... Angela...
Yes, Mama?
Come on!
He's sleeping.
It's Maria's, beyond a doubt.
She might have given it to someone.
She had a child, 10 years ago.
The baby didn't live.
How do we know?
But Don Luis told us!
After all, he was her husband...
He was there at the time.
Don Luis lied.
Of course...
If the Marquis de Vincitata...
...saw fit to abandon his wife's baby...
...there can be only one explanation!
Oh, no!
I won't have it thought that he...
He's a foundling.
And he'll remain a foundling.
That's all very well to say...
But if he bears YOUR name...
He'll NOT bear it.
We'll give him one.
No father!
No mother!
No name!
A child of sorrow and adversity...
Adversity...
Yes... by all the saints, he's earned it!
We'll call him "Adverse"!
Now... and forever.
Anthony Adverse.
Angela... good morning!
Anthony, get up!  It's late!
Are we market today?
If you hurry, it's after 7...
Mr Bonnyfeather's having his breakfast already.
Why didn't you call me?
We've been making enough noise to wake everyone in Leghorn!
Angela... Angela!
Yes, Mama, I'm coming.
Good morning, Faith.
Good morning, sir.
Good morning, my boy.
Any news from Paris?
Louis XVI has been put to death, as I expected.
Marie-Antoinette will follow.
Tony... watch what you're doing!
You've become fairly impossible.
Well, who wouldn't, with 10 children!
Eh, Tony?
Si, si Signore!
Excuse please.
7 hens.
No... 8.
Fill up the teapot, someone!
Fill it up yourself, you idiot!
Woman!
Then she burst out crying... and threw the dishrag in Poppa's face!
Poor Tony... What's happened to him?
It's the big state lottery...
He's used up all our savings, buying tickets.
You can imagine Mama, if he doesn't win something.
I've been wasting all my pity on the King of France.
Speaking of lottery tickets...
Look.
Is it yours?
What would you do if you won?
Well, first, I'd marry YOU!
Then I'd buy a real villa...
...with vineyards... and a huge fountain in the courtyard.
And a goat?
The finest goat in Leghorn!
No you wouldn't...
You just say that.
Haven't I always said it?
It's different now...
We're not children any longer.
It's all the more reason to believe me.
I wish I were a great lady!
With beautiful clothes and a carriage all my own.
Then you'd be proud of me...
...instead of being ashamed of me.
I'll never be ashamed of you, Angela.
Never in a thousand years!
You will... some day.
Look at me!
You mustn't.... not on a road like this!
Let's sing!
Oh the spring will not be there forever...
And this day will return to us never...
All the promises made...
You have all mislaid...
I will wait here for you, oh my love.
I'll wait for you my love.
Attention, please!
An American brig is docking... with merchandise from London.
You'll report to McNab at once...
He's over thee now, with the invoices.
Anthony!
You've become quite a man!
I might even say, a handsome young man!
Handsome enough to turn the heads of the finest young ladies in Leghorn.
Tell me...
Why don't you linger longer with younger people?
I have work to do!
You've plenty of time to spend with the cook's daughter.
Oh, not that I object!
She's a charming girl, but...
But you've got to take your proper place in the world.
What IS my proper place?
Does anyone know?
You're...
You're a man, Anthony...
You'll make your own place.
Just run over to the quay...
...and welcome Capt. Jorham for me, will you?
I'm told he's a diminutive old fellow...
But he's proud!
As all the Yankees are...
You'll need tact!
You can depend on me, sir.
I hope so.
I should like to find someone...
...with whom I could share my responsibilities.
Sometimes, the great house of Bonnyfeather... becomes too heavy a burden for one man's shoulders.
My shoulders are broad, sir!
They belong to you...
...to use as you see fit.
Run along.... and don't forget...
Be sure to invite Capt. Jorham to dinner.
Yes, sir!
What was that crowd, out in the square?
When?
They're picking the winning numbers in the lottery tonight.
Gambling! Did you hear that?!
These foreigners 'd corrupt the devil himself!
Thar she spouts!
Pipe down, Mrs Jorham!
Elisha, you're drunk!
Belay your sheets, woman!
So would ye be, if you'd had as much as me!
Listen!
They've finished... They're celebrating.
It's Tony Guessippi!
He's won the lottery!
It's Papa!
Wait... what's this?!
Yes... look at me!
It is me... Tony Guessippi!
I have won the lottery!
Insult me now, if you dare!
Shut up, you fool!
Wait!
How much money did he win?
40,000 scudi...
But it will not last him long!
He has ordered 12 carriages!
One for each member of the family!
One moment, please!
Tony, where are you going?
Far away... to the home of my ancestors...
And I am not coming back!
Wait!
Very well... Go!
Take your family... Get out!
And never let me see you again!
Angela... you mustn't go!
You don't know Papa when he's like this...
I must take care of the little ones.
I'll go with you.
No... that would make things worse.
Anthony, if you love me, find me later...
But don't come now!
Stop it!
Angela, you can't go... you mustn't go!
Anthony, I must!
Let me go!
I give up!
Your name is Adverse, isn't it?
Why did you grab me?
Don't worry... I won't again!
I'm Vincent Nolte, in case you're interested.
My father's a banker...
He does a lot of business with Mr Bonnyfeather.
She's gone!
Forget it... She'll come back.
You couldn't catch her now, anyway.
Oh, good evening Mr Bonnyfeather.
I was just saying, my father's a friend of yours.
Herr Nolte... the banker.
Why, upon my soul... How big you've grown!
Scarcely recognised you!
Mr Adverse ought to get around more.
I can't understand why we've never met.
Anthony, why don't you and young Nolte spend the evening together.
Thank you sir, but I'm not a man of leisure...
I've work to do.
I think you've worked too hard lately...
It's time you relaxed and had a little pleasure.
Later.
He's right, you know... What do you say?
Well... good night gentlemen!
Have a good time!
No thanks... I don't think I'll...
Oh, come on!
Does this mean you're closing down for good sir?
Yes... I'm afraid so.
Tell the men they're to have a month's salary...
...and their freedom.
And you might add...
I'm revising my will today.
Each one of you will be remembered.
Thank you, sir!
The remainder of my estate...
...I bequeath to my apprentice...
...Anthony Adverse....
...provided he is still living at the time this will is executed.
If he is not living, at such a time...
...I desire that the residue of my estate...
...shall be divided equally...
...between the aforesaid Faith Peliolegus...
...and the Convent of the Holy Child.
That's all you hear...
Business is at a standstill.
We're shutting down completely at the bank.
So are we.
And Bonaparte calls himself a liberator!
He has to enslave people first...
...before he can liberate them!
That's the way with conquerors.
- What can we do?   - Fight him!
We'll fight him!
It's no use, Tommy...
He's in Florence already.
In a few days, he'll be here...
...and not a soul will lay a hand to stop him.
Instead, he'll be hailed...
Let's forget about Bonaparte...
Think of something else.
How about going to the opera tonight?
There's a new company from Milan.
Music before the battle, eh?!
It may be the last we hear, for a long time.
You're right... I'd like to go!
Come along... let's buy the tickets.
Look, Vincent... There's Angela!
- Angela!  - Where?
The shepherdess, there in the middle.
I'm going down to see her!
No, wait until the act is over...
You won't be able to see her till then, in any case.
Good night!
Signora Bovino.
Si, signorina.
Signorina Guessippi.
Si Signore... is she expecting you?
I'm an old friend.
Come in!
Who is it?
A gentlemen here to see you.
Gentleman? What gentlemen?
Adolfo, Maria, Nicolo, Pietrica, Vittoria...
Anthony!
Let me see you... It's been so long!
That's right... So hard to find you!
I've searched everywhere!
Oh, Angela mia!
Signora... and ovation... magnificent!
Just as you predicted!
Oh, I'm glad.
Debrulle, they shouted... Debrulle!
As though I were the whole troupe!
The stars never lie...
From now on your troupe will prosper!
Bless you! Come... give us some wine!
- We must celebrate!   - No, not now.
Why not?!
She doesn't need wine... She's happy!
Let her be.
She's asleep?
Aren't you proud of me?
I adore you!
I mean... the singing.
I adore your singing, too!
Oh... silly!
You couldn't possibly hear me with all those other girls pitching at the top of their lungs!
Oh you're different!
You stood right out!
I'm awkward perhaps... Or do I sing off-pitch?
You've learned how to get compliments!
Not compliments, Anthony...
I want the truth.
Signore Debrulle...
He's been very kind to me.
He's a nice man... full of encouragement.
But unless I can be a great singer...
...I'd rather not go on.
Even if you could, I wouldn't let you.
But I must earn my living somehow!
Have you forgotten already?
Forgotten?
The finest goat in Leghorn!
Do you still love me, Angela?
Of course!
What is it?!
Your career?
Yes... that is...
Oh, Anthony, don't you understand?
It's Bonnyfeather.
He's never give his consent!
Oh, I can make him understand!
- I know I can!   - And if you can't?
Angela, these 2 years have changed me...
I've worked...
I've earned a real place for myself in the house of Bonnyfeather.
I repaid, in a way... a part of the kindness he's shown me.
Then, if he needs you, he'll never let you go.
The House of Bonnyfeather's closed its doors.
Once again, I'm Anthony Adverse, orphan.
I have nothing...
I mean no inheritance... no tradition.
But I have my self!
And the name that was invented for me.
With you, Angela...
I could make that name stand for something.
For a new generation...
A great new family tradition.
Are you willing to give up your career...
...and your name?
For a man who hasn't even a real name of his own to give you?
Oh, Anthony, I love you!
Does he know you're leaving?
No.
Don't tell him then.
Just go.
Why?
Because he's so selfish!
He'll want to keep you.
Not when he knows Angela and I are married.
Anthony... take my advice.
Bonnyfeather's through!
From now on this house will be a mausoleum...
A place to rot in!
So will Leghorn, so will Europe, for that matter!
If I were you, I'd go as far away as possible.
Come in.
Mr Bonnyfeather would like to see you.
Put this in, too.
When are you meeting her?
At noon.
Outside the convent.
Goodbye, Maria.
And good riddance!
Come in, Anthony.
Sit down.
I want to talk to you.
Anthony...
How would you like to go to Havana?
Go to Havana?!
It's for you to decide, of course.
But first let me do a little explaining.
Now as you know...
I'm being forced into retirement...
...by circumstances over which I have no control.
And even if conditions should change...
...I feel I'm too old...
...ever to become active again.
The wealth that I have accumulated, therefore...
...is of the utmost importance to me.
But unfortunately... that wealth is in the form of credit.
Money that is owing to us in all parts of the world.
Now, among our debtors...
...is a firm known as Gallego and Son...
...which has its headquarters in Havana.
Now, their debt is a very large one.
It amounts to 75% of my entire estate.
And so far, I've been unable to collect it.
They refuse to pay it?
Precisely.
And with Europe in the throes of war...
...there's no possible way to force them...
...other than to send someone there.
Haven't we an agent in Havana?
We have... but he's failed repeatedly.
Gallego and Son are slippery customers.
One has to resort to all manner of tricks.
Unless I'm mistaken...
It will require months of constant effort.
The employment of tact, influence...
...and above all, determination.
Now, the reason I want YOU to undertake this mission...
...is because you're nearer to me than anyone I know.
It's the sort of thing a man would entrust to a son...
...if he had a son.
This is...
...the first real service you ever asked of me.
When would you want me to go?
I've arranged with Capt. Jorham...
You can sail tomorrow.
As soon as that?!
Aye!
The French fleet's on its way to Gibraltar to effect a blockade.
In that case, won't I have trouble getting back?
It might take a year... possibly 2!
Would you be so good as to tell Capt. Jorham...
...to make accommodation for 2.
Why?
I should like my wife to accompany me.
Your wife!
Yes.
I was married to Angela Guessippi...
...this morning.
What time is it now?
1 o'clock.
Well, I can't wait any longer...
...will you please fasten this note to the bell-pull, over there.
Alright... drive on!
You'll be sure to locate Angela... and tell her.
Aye... that I will...
And remember my boy, whatever happens...
...your home is here.
Some day, God willing...
...the doors of Casa Bonnyfeather will open again...
...for you... if not for me.
Thank you sir.
I shan't forget.
And how is our thrifty merchant getting along?...
...The Honourable John Bonnyfeather.
That old fool?!
The bigger fool... the better for you!
Your inheritance.
You flatter me... Your Excellency!
Why do you always call me 'Your Excellency'?
Well, perhaps if i saw you oftener than once every 2 or  years when you happen to be passing through Leghorn...
If you think it's on my way...
...you're mistaken.
When I left Madrid I had orders from the king...
...to proceed direct to Paris.
So, you see?!
Then take me with you, please!
You promised!
My dear...
...an attractive woman doesn't go to Paris...
...she lets Paris come to HER!
Meaning YOU, I suppose?!
You are so wise!
So clever!
But I know something that would kill you...
...if you knew!
And when will I have the pleasure of knowing?
When Paris no longer comes to Faith.
Well, goodbye Capt. Jorham...
It was a splendid voyage and I enjoyed it.
Pretty smart navigating, too...
The last time I hit Cuba...
...I was aiming for Charleston, South Carolina!
Welcome!
Welcome for the good Capt. Jorham!
And this, I'm certain, must be Señor Adverse!
Delighted to meet you!
I'm Carlo Cibo.
Mr Bonnyfeather's representative.
And how's the enchanting Mrs Jorham?
She's waiting for me on board.
- Well, God bless you.  - Thank you sir.
Now, Mr Bonnyfeather...
Oh, yes, his letter about you arrived last week.
Unfortunate. Quite futile!
You might have saved yourself a journey.
Oh... you shall see!
My servant... devoted to me...
He'll bring your luggage to my house.
- But what...?    -We still have plenty of time!
Bring Señor Adverse's luggage to my home.
Don't sleep on your way...
...or you'll get a beating!
My house is yours.
We shall drink to the past...
...forget the future...
...and pleasantly live the present.
I have a million questions about Europe...
...to ask you.   - Yes, but time is...
Please...time is unlimited in Havana.
I'm a gentleman of leisure...
With a house full of servants...
...and charming disposition.
And an overwhelming power of persuasion.
You'll be glad I persuaded you, my friend!
But wait till you see Havana!
Señor, let me make myself clear...
I've come to Cuba for one reason...
...and one only...
...to collect the just debt to Mr Bonnyfeather.
And to return to my home and my wife, as speedily as possible.
An admirable ambition, but quite futile.
- Why?   - Because Gallego has quit! Gone away...
There's nothing left of the firm but an old trading post in Africa.
Well, I shall have to go there.
Take it over, if need be.
You can probably have it...
But who wants it?!
It's only good for slave trading.
Slave trading?!
Sure!... Gallego and Son were slave traders.
Didn't you know that?
My friend... the strongest men break when they try to battle with fate.
Now, let me see...
You need a bit of tailoring, the first thing...
And then...
Tony... did you hear me?
Anthony!
I said you need completely new and different clothes.
I shall arrange with my tailors to...
You remind me of Mr Bonnyfeather...
The first time I met him...
He thought I needed clothes too!
And did you?
As I recall, I was stark naked!
My boy... you haven't stopped to figure out yet that life is just a series of sensations.
Some to be desired...
...others to be avoided. That's all that matters!
For instance...
...at this moment you and I are riding comfortably in a carriage... enjoying ourselves...
...while over there in that courtyard...
...a poor devil who is doubtless a much better Christian than we are...
...is being beaten to death.
Hey... stop!
Enough! Stop it!
I'll start with you!
Wait! Tony...
To interfere with a master and slave is punishable by death!
Come back to the carriage!
Stop it!
Back to the carriage!
Listen!
Bring the monk!
I know you, Carlo Cibo!
I know you!
You've seen what happens to slaves...
You've seen how a wicked system...
...has given one man the right of life and death...
...over his fellow men.
You've seen a man beaten, tortured, killed...
...because he was unfortunate enough to have been born poor.
My son...
You'll meet a lot like her in Africa.
I want to speak to Señor Cibo!
We're honoured by a visit from the police.
Be quiet... both of you!
Tell them to keep on playing.
Señor, I'm sorry to disturb you...
...but we're looking for a monk.
A monk with Carlo Cibo?!
Upon my soul!
You know me better than that!
- He was seen in your company.  - Impossible!
Nevertheless, I must search your house!
Have you a warrant from the governor?
Not yet, señor, but nevertheless...
Nevertheless you have to get one.
Goodnight!
- Has he gone?   - For the moment.
- What can we do?
There's no chance for François, I'm afraid...
Unless you can smuggle him out of Cuba.
You've both been very kind to me...
I thank you...
...and I'll pray for you.  - Where are you going?
To give myself up.
There's no need for you to become involved.
- Come with me.   - Where to?
- To Africa.  - Anthony, no!
In heaven's name, I implore you not to go...
You'll destroy yourself...
You'll live in eternal horror...
Unable to sleep... unable to think!
Followed always by the cries of those you've sold into misery.
You cannot barter in human souls!
My debt is to Bonnyfeather.
It's a greater sin, not to repay it.
I think you're making a terrible mistake, Anthony.
Cuba is flourishing...
You can go into some business here...
...and eventually pay off Mr Bonnyfeather.
It may take longer...
But it mustn't take longer.
It must be done as quickly as possible.
I must get back to my wife.
My son... I will go with you to Africa.
Now you'll have to withstand salvation, Tony...
Morning, noon and night!
Perhaps I'll need salvation.
Receipts... 221 slaves at auction...
Total proceeds today... £18,404.
Net profit on last shipment...
A nice profit.
With luck, today's trading should settle the Bonnyfeather debt.
Yes.
And you'll be free to go back to Europe.
I imagine you'll be glad to get away from this infernal noise!
What do you want, Neleta?
You have not ordered the food prepared for the feast after the trading.
There's plenty of time.
Please... you won't go away.
Isn't there work for you to do?
Ferdinando... welcome the chiefs for me.
But they expect YOU!
- They will be insulted!  - Do as I say!
Mr Adverse...
You ARE coming back with me, aren't you?
I'm sure that Mr Bonnyfeather...
Bonnyfeather! What does HE care?!
Has he ever once written me?
3 years in this hole, and not a word!
- Nothing!   - Well, perhaps...
The master of Futa Jaloon must be welcomed by the master of Belagos...
Not a servant.
I give you my greetings...
And by the blessing of Allah... trading will begin this day at the firing of the gun.
I'll give £6.
I'll take £8.25.
Look! The strength of a horse...
Teeth like pearls!
He is worth 8!
7... and no more.
Done!
What's wrong here?
This one thinks he's been cheated.
- Only £7! He is worth...  - Quiet!
If there's any more trouble, the trading will stop!
You can go back to your villages as you came here...
Penniless!
Take him away!
Bring another one.
I see François is still helping the cripples.
The chiefs hate him.
They call him the White Devil-Doctor.
Have you no pity?
I told you I wanted no more trouble.
I've said that Brother François may have the rejected slaves...
And I say it again!
He protects runaway slaves!
He only protects those slaves that you's kill... because they've been rejected.
Take your cripple away from here!
Go on with the trading!
Bring another one!
Brother François!
There is one other you might save.
Who?
Mr Adverse... Today settles the debt.
I told you to go back to your huts!
The time has come when you said you'd leave.
My son, there can be no justification for sin.
But what little justification you thought you had... no longer exists.
You must go back.
To do what?
You have a wife.
How do I know?
Have I once heard from her?
Maybe she's dead.
In love with someone else.
Find out.
If she still loves me, she can wait a little longer.
There's money here... money and power!
For the first time in my life the name Adverse means something.
It's respected and feared.
By savages!
You yourself call them brothers.
Yet YOU would make slaves of them!
Well, what am I?
I'm slaving to pay a debt!
And a slave to conventions and gratitude.
Now, I pay a debt to myself.
I owe myself wealth and power.
I owe the name that was invented for me the right to perpetuate itself.
It will not live, Anthony...
It will die of its own evil...
....unless you give it back to honour and truth.
I won't let it die.
I'll stay here.
When I can afford to leave, I will.
Afford?
Is it only the rich who can afford to be kind?
And live without sin?
I shan't come here to trouble you any more.
If you want to see me, you'll have to come to my hut.
The ship's going.
With a big cargo, too.
The last until the rains are over.
Rains!
Neleta, you've had your wish...
The boat went away without me.
I am glad!
Master... Brother François refuses to come here.
Very well...
Why do you stare at me?
Go in the other room! Get out!
Get out of here!
It's your move, Mr Adverse.
Brother François!
My son, what is it? You have a fever!
Father Xavier!
Where have you been?
Anthony! Come... help me!
Quem nostrum ignorare arbitraris...
Father Xavier!
Could I go for a walk outside the walls?
What do you want?
I've come to see Anthony.
Get out!... We don't want you here!
Angela mia!
He hates you.  He said to go away!
Help me to save him!
If you don't go away from here...
I'll take your flock, and ship them to Havana!
Children, cripples and all!
Your master wouldn't let you!
How can he stop me?
He is sick.
I am master, now!
Please!
Remember what I said...
I'll give you until tomorrow to be gone!
Anthony, you must go back to bed!
No word from Brother François?
You told him I was still down with fever?
I told him, but he will not come.
Don't worry any more!
You are better... You are getting well!
In a few days the sun will shine!
There will be trading again.
Anthony will stay here...
For great power... Grow rich!
Power...
Money...
I must see Brother François!
It's nothing!
How do you know?
Where is Brother François?!
- In his hut, I tell you!   - You lie!
He's out in the jungle...
- They're after him to kill him!   - No!
- Tell me the truth!   - I am telling the truth!
You sent him away, that's what you did!
You hated him and wanted him to leave Africa...
You beast... You savage!
Brother François!
Brother François!
You're dying!
No, Anthony...
It is you who are dying... Not I.
Forgive me, I didn't know that...
They didn't tell me you'd been driven away.
Promise...
Promise me you'll leave Africa.
I promise!
Brother François!
Where do you go, Signore?
Casa da Bonnyfeather.
- On business?  - Why?
The Casa da Bonnyfeather has been closed for the past 5 years,
I expected it would be.
Drive along.
Your Excellency has lived in Leghorn?
Yes... some years ago.
Do you remember a Vincent Nolte?
Yes... yes... I remember!
He's in Paris, now.
A great banker they say...
A friend of Napoleon.
He come here every now and then.
What brings him back?
Surely it can't be on business.
He's searching for a friend...
A young clerk, who went to sea and disappeared.
Disappeared?
Si, Signore, disappeared.
Too bad!
When the old Bonnyfeather died...
...left him a big fortune.
Bonnyfeather is dead?!
Yes... Over a year.
Mr Bonnyfeather's housekeeper?
Couldn't she locate this young clerk either?
No... Lucky for her too.
If this clerk will not come back...
...she will get all the money!
Adverse, yes... Anthony Adverse!
That was his name.
Ever hear of him?
There used to be an inn on the Strada Calypso...
- Si... Signora Bonino's place.   - That's right.
Drop my luggage there please.
You trust me, Signore?
Oh, I think so...
Just say it's for Mr Adverse. Mr Anthony Adverse.
Can you remember that?
- You!   - May I come in?
Did you think I'd died in Africa?
I didn't know what to think...
Your letters...
You knew where I was, but you weren't going to tell, were you, Faith?
Mr Bonnyfeather didn't want it known that you were engaged in slave-trading.
Anthony... why do you take this attitude?
We've always been friends.
On the contrary...
You've hated me from the first time I came here.
But why? That's what I want to know!
And why was Bonnyfeather so fond of me...
...to leave me his money?
Why... he was in his dotage!
That isn't true.
You know the real reason... Now tell me!
Tell me!
Oh... Don Luis!
This is Mr Adverse...
The heir to Bonnyfeather's estate.
Congratulations, Signore.
Your arrival is most opportune.
Would you join us?
We have much to talk over.
It's strange that I never heard
Mr Bonnyfeather speak of you.
I might say the same, Signore.
At one time,
Mr Bonnyfeather and I were very intimate.
But that was before you were born.
At least, before you were adopted.
Don Luis...
Do you know if Mr Bonnyfeather had any...
...unwelcome relatives?
Anyone, of whom he might have been ashamed?
What makes you ask?
I can't help feeling that I'm related to him.
The first time we met... I remember distinctly...
He was sitting at his desk in the other room...
..talking to a priest.
And when he looked in my direction, he stopped suddenly...
...and just stared.
And tears came to his eyes.
Your parents might have been friends of his.
Perhaps.
Yet, why should he make me his heir?
You have no recollection?
Only that I was raised by a group of nuns...
...at the Convent of the Holy Child...
Anyone who could help prove Mr Adverse's identity would be very welcome, I'm sure.
I know how eager he is.
You...enquired at the convent?
Records are meagre.
I was left there on the 17th January, 1773.
Abandoned?!
Yes... in a black bag...
...containing a Madonna and a few gold pieces.
Rather interesting...
Don't you think, Don Luis?
Young man... if I were you,
I wouldn't seek to know more.
You've been extraordinarily fortunate, as it is.
But isn't it only natural...
Considering the circumstances...
...it might also be dangerous.
Why?
For many reasons.
I advise you to forget it!
You are going to Paris?
At once... about the will.
I'll see Mr Nolte.
I trust you'll have no difficulty in establishing your claim?
Thank you, Señor.
I really came here to locate Angels... my wife.
I don't suppose you know what became of her?
Angela?!
Let's see...
The last I heard, she was touring the provinces with an opera company.
How long ago was that?
3 years... no, 4 years.
And Mr Bonnyfeather never tried to get in touch with her?
I couldn't say, I'm sure.
Wouldn't it be more truthful to admit that you prevented him from getting in touch with her.
Pray that I'll find her, Faith...
...and ease your conscience.
If you have one.
Goodbye, Don Luis.
I'm indebted to you.
For the tea.
I told you I had a secret.
I told you, years ago.
You couldn't prove it.
Oh, couldn't I?!
There's an old picture of Maria...
...locked away in my drawer.
The resemblance is still remarkable...
Even a stranger would know.
I should have let him die.
I'd be a rich woman, if you had.
I'd be in Paris, claiming an estate.
Keep quiet! You'll have it yet!
No I won't... There's not a chance.
But I'll have SOMETHING for the life I've lived.
The disappointment. The years of boredom.
And you're the one who'll give it to me!
- I?!   - For the price of that picture.
For the honour of a grandee of Spain whose pretty wife had a child...   - Silence!
Hurts, doesn't it?  Makes you cringe!
You detestable creature!
What is it you want?
Your name... in marriage!
- Are you sure?  - Yes!
Sancho... Don't let that coach get past!
What are you stopping for?
There is a coach ahead...
Pretty close, I should say...
...judging from the tracks.
Never mind... keep going.
Mr Adverse!
- Have you any enemies?   - Why?
Take a look at that coach down there...
See it?... hiding behind the boulder...
It looks to me as if they were waiting to shove someone into the gorge.
Of course, they may not...
But on the other hand, there is that precipice.
How are the brakes?
Hold the coach maybe...
But the horses would drag us.
Could you hold the coach, without the horses?
Without the horses?!
Come down here... I'll show you what I mean.
If we could get that pin out, quickly enough...
He was the best servant I ever had.
The coach was rather handy, too!
Let's see your papers!
Come on... hurry up!
What's all the excitement around here?
None of your business!
Are we far from Paris?
2 or 3 hours.
Thank you.
Major... I have some information for you...
Yes, your Excellency?
Some way back, we met an Englishman...
...who I recognised as a spy...
He's travelling this way.
An Englishman?!
There isn't a doubt of it!
He's travelling under the name of Anthony Adverse.
Don't pay any attention to his passport!
Thank you, your Excellency!
We'll watch out for him!
- Pleasant journey!   - Thank you, major!
- What's the trouble?   - No trouble, monsieur...
If your papers are in order, you'll be allowed to continue.
Anthony Adverse? From Leghorn?
Yes.
Are you a native of Leghorn?
- I was born there.   - Have you any proof?
My passport.
Step out, please.
Is that not sufficient?
You are perhaps unaware, Mr Adverse...
...that France and England are still at war.
I may be English, but I'm an Italian subject.
And your parents?
Your father... What was he?!
Don't you know?!
Arrest him!
The general will see you, Herr Nolte... that you'll do him the honour of remaining for dinner.
Thank you Mr Bourrienne.
It won't be much in the way of food, I'm afraid...
- Just a military mess...   - I'll be delighted.
What is it Doumet?
I've arrested this fellow on grounds of suspicion.
Also, for insulting an officer of the French army.
- An Englishman.  - That's good enough.
- Anthony!   - Hello, Vincent!
How did you get here?
Ask the major.
Do you know him?
Certainly I know him...
His name's Anthony Adverse.
We grew up together in Leghorn.
I was told the gentleman was a British spy.
By whom?
A traveller in the poste-chaise...
A Spanish nobleman.
A Spanish nobleman travelling in a public coach?
It does seem strange somehow...
Strange? It's incredible.
HE's the man you should have arrested.
Sorry, sir.
Release the guard.
My apologies, Mr Adverse...
I trust you won't mention this to the General?
I'm glad to be relieved of the necessity.
It's extremely regrettable, but unfortunately...
- De Bourrienne...   - Yes, I'm coming.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Tell me some more of this business.
Well, the main thing is this...
We advanced a huge sum of money to Bonaparte...
...with the understanding he would pay us back...
...the moment he could lay his hands on a lot of gold that is owing him in Mexico.
He learned recently that the gold can't be shipped to France without the payment of an exorbitant tax.
So he's refused to authorise its collection.
Until he does, we don't get our money.
Meanwhile, his failure to pay has brought us to the verge of bankruptcy
And you too... personally!
As well as my clients.
Oh, it's frightful, Tony.
Why don't you let me lend you the money that I've inherited from Mr Bonnyfeather.
That'll tide you over...
...at least until this gold affair is settled.
I wish there was some other means, Ouvrard.
Frankly... I'd rather lose everything... than have Anthony run the risk of impoverishing himself.
There isn't any risk...
I'm absolutely certain the gold will be delivered.
I too, monsieur.
I've even got Mademoiselle Georges to use her influence with Napoleon.
Mademoiselle Georges? Who's she?
A new prima donna...
Bonaparte's infatuated with her.
An exquisite creature.
I'm to have the honour of escorting her to the ball tomorrow night.
You don't say!
Would you like to go, Tony?
Perhaps we'd better.
It's entirely up to you.
Well, gentlemen...
I guess there's nothing more to discuss...
Is there?
Au revoir, monsieur... and thank you for your generosity.
The money you're placing at our disposal...
...will just about save our skins.
You're quite welcome.
- Goodnight Vincent.   - Goodnight.
Tony... do you realise what you've done?
Yes.
You may lose your entire fortune.
Everything!
I know.
Don't you care for money?
Doesn't it mean anything to you?
Not very much, Vincent.
A man died so that I might learn there was something besides money and power.
Tell me, what's happened to you?
If you don't want money and power...
...what DO you want?
Angela.
Good heavens, man...
You're not still looking for HER?
She's probably...
Probably dead... probably forgotten me...
Probably this, that, or 1000 other things.
I think about it till I'm ready to go mad.
Then I assure myself that one thing is possible...
SOMEWHERE... Angela is waiting for me.
Be reasonable Anthony...
Why should she wait for you?
Because she's my wife.
Because we pledged ourselves to the future...
...of the name that was invented for me.
With her, I can give it roots in the present...
..and have children to carry it to the future.
Love, a home, a tradition!
These are the very essence of a man's soul.
There are his wealth and his power.
Without them, he has nothing.
The general is early tonight.
Naturally... He's expecting Mademoiselle Georges.
According to Mr Nolte...
You had some very exciting adventures in Africa.
Please tell us about them!
I assure you I never had one quite the equal of this.
Your friend's quite intriguing!
And I think very handsome.
Wait until you see him without his mask!
I can hardly wait till we unmask at midnight.
Mlle Georges has just arrived.
- Mademoiselle... your mask.  - Thank you.
Mademoiselle... May I have the honour?
Pleasure, monsieur.
This is once, Ouvrard...
...that I am willing to acknowledge my indebtedness to a banker.
I've been told that Napoleon is a bad dancer.
You were told right, Mr Adverse... watch!
A friend of yours?
No!
I thought...
Mr Ouvrard must be hiding...
I can't see him anywhere.
- Allow me...   - No, please!
Can't seem to place him... Show him in.
I hope you'll pardon me...
The nature of my visit...
Debrulle! Why of course I remember!
It's been a long time since Leghorn.
Nevertheless, I should've remembered the name.
Where is Angela?
Surely you must know!
I do... that's why I'm here!
Oh my friend... My friend!
Tell me, Debrulle, is she still with the troupe?
No... no more.
Has she given up her singing?
Well... not entirely!
She still sings a little.
Where is she now?
She's taken a cottage out near Passy.
Passy? Then I can see her at once!
Why not!
Bless you! Come on... hurry!
Why does she live in such an out-of-the-way place?
Well, perhaps because she prefers it.
Go... Go, she's waiting for you!
Anthony!
Don't talk!
Just let me hold you close to me!
You've changed, but your eyes are still the same.
Oh darling, what happened?
What EVER happened?!
Bonnyfeather promised to tell you...
He didn't!
I went there once...
...but he sent word by Faith that you didn't wish to see me.
- Faith lied!  - Is it true you went to Africa?
Faith would have told you that...
She knew that I was planning...
Let's not think of her now!
She doesn't matter.
All I want is to see you...
...feel your presence...
...and to know we're together.
Forever, this time.
Nothing must ever separate is again...
Nothing!
Why, Anthony?!
I've died a thousand times since I saw you last.
I've been greedy and cruel...
I've wanted wealth and power.
Now I know there's nothing I want, but you.
Only you.
And the future that we'll make together...
- Anthony...  - Yes, mother?
You won't have to go to Havana to find your father.  He's come back!
This is he!
My son!
And then what?
He took the child in his arms.
Was I right?
As usual.
That is all... you may go.
A child in his arms...
Do you want him arrested?
For being in love? Don't be a fool!
We can order him out of France.
No, that's wrong.
He must leave of his own accord.
Congratulations!
What for?
Bonaparte's agreed to our scheme.
- On the Mexican gold?  - Yes.
I've never seen him more amiable.
And whom do you think he's chosen to go to America?
- How would I know?  - YOU, Tony!
None other than you, Anthony Adverse.
Provided you're willing, of course... sit down...
Let's talk it over.
The gold will be smuggled into New Orleans... where you will receive it... and arrange for its transfer to Philadelphia.
There it can be shipped on a neutral boat, direct to France.
It's our only chance to get hold of it, Tony.
Failure means bankruptcy.
For you, as well as for us.
You don't seem to relish the idea.
Yesterday I should have welcomed it... now...
Decisions of this sort take time, naturally.
On the other hand we can't disguise the fact that it's a matter of the gravest importance... for all concerned.
I understand.
I'll give you my answer within 48 hours.
Don't worry, Vin.
It's your, now.
I want you to keep it always.
- Goodnight mummy.  - Goodnight, darling.
You've won him completely.
Angela...
Have I won you?... That's the question.
Anthony... you must go to America, regardless of me.
I couldn't.
Not even to save Vincent.
But you're own money's at stake, as well as his.
Some day it should go to our son.
You wouldn't want him to be poor, as WE were.
You're my wife, Angela.
I can't understand you're not wanting to come with me.
You're hiding something... What is it?
I have my career.
You told me once, you didn't want a career unless you could be a great singer.
Truly great.
Yes... I remember.
After all, what does it mean to be great?
Look at Mlle Georges and Bonaparte...
Everyone knows how she managed to succeed.
Is that what they're saying?
You don't envy HER, do you?
No... I don't envy her.
Why won't you come with me... Why?
Oh, my darling!
My sweet!
You're all the world to me.
You're everything I ever wanted.
I only know that, now.
Don't say any more, Anthony!
Please don't say any more!
I didn't mean to make a scene.
I must be nervous...
I always am when I'm going to sing.
Sing? Where?
Tomorrow night.
- At the Opéra.   - Here?! In Paris?!
Yes.
That's wonderful!
Did you think I'd mind?!
I'll be there to hear you!
Oh, I'll be so proud!
Oh, Anthony!...
Oh, my husband... Hold me close!
Have you heard the rumour about the necklace?
The one Josephine has been begging for.
They say Bonaparte's given it to Mlle Georges!
No! He wouldn't dare!
Will she wear it, do you think?
No woman could resist a triumph like that!
Good evening, Ouvrard... Greetings!
How DO you do?!
This is quite a surprise, Don Luis!
I didn't expect to see you in Paris.
Nor I to see you, Monsieur.
Allow me to present my wife.
Life is strange, is it not, monsieur?
Incredibly.
I can't find Angela's name on the program.
Ssh! Mlle Georges is about to appear!
That's her voice!
That's Angela!
Quiet! That's Mlle Georges!
That girl used to wash my clothes.
I remember.
The necklace! You see it?
Goodbye, Anthony!
Goodbye.
Dearest Anthony...
You are far better fitted than I
to take care of...
...of our son.
I send him to you with all the love in my heart...
I know he will be happy.
Forgive me...
for not seeing you again.
Angela.
Mummy said that I'm to go away with you.
On a big ship.
Your mother said that?
She did... Honestly!
Are you sure you didn't ask her?
All I said was...
"Why don't you come, too?"
And she said...
Well, she would make it, some other time.
But that YOU had to go, and it seems a shame not to have someone to go with you.
So I said... "Alright, I'll go!"
Did you mean it?
Do you really want to go?
Oh, Father!
Set tight all tacks and braces!
Well, here we are... off to America!
- Ever been there?    - No, never.
Lots of people going nowadays.
And they ain't coming back, either.
Looks as though they'll have a big country over there!
Peace of mind.
That's all they're looking for.
A chance to lead lives of their own making.
Great place for youngsters, too...
They grow up big and strong!
You'll like it Master Adverse.
"Adverse"?  Is THAT my name?
Yes.
It's a new name, son.
Three people made it.
Father Xavier gave it a mind...
Father François, a soul...
And your mother, a heart.
We must never forget them Anthony.
- "Anthony Adverse"?   - Yes.
Anthony Adverse.

       [THUNDER CRASHES]        
         Stop. Stop there.      
           It proves            
   we were absolutely right.    
 One yell from us that Hanley's 
    been getting a rake-off     
   on the new roads and bridges,
           just one yell,       
            and the assistant   
            district attorney   
               wakes up         
      the president of the joint
     in the middle of the night,
        and they burn the books.
                But our yell was
                for those books.
 If they burn them, we have only
   your unsupported testimony.  
  No.                           
         No.                    
       Peace, peace. All of you.
              Wait, look.       
        The fact that they can't
            produce the books   
       is the fact that supports
             my testimony.      
Don't you see, chief? The cement company will only be the start, the bomb that will blow up the whole rotten mess.          
       [INTERCOM BUZZES]        
     WOMAN [OVER INTERCOM]:     
 Mr. Hanley's on the telephone, 
              sir.              
                   Hello.       
               Hello, Hanley.   
            What's on your mind?
Listen, Patterson, you tell that smart reporter of yours, Ross, that he's digging himself into a hole it'll be awfully tough to get out of.                  
    I'll give him the message.  
            That all?           
No. I just wanna warn you against going completely crazy. 
You've given me a million-dollar libel suit if I ever saw one.   
And, Patterson, I know how to use a libel suit.        
If you don't print a retraction of this graft story,            
I'll break you.                 
Make no mistake about it,       
I can do it.                    
Thanks for your interest, Jesse,
     but I'm still running      
         my own paper.          
All right, you asked for it.    
                  I think       
           that's what I needed.
             All right.         
    If it's going to be a fight,
       we'll take off the gloves
          and let him have it.  
Play up the burning of the books. Play it up big.   
Write your version of the affair under your own byline.          
     You've got it, pappy.      
         Come on, baby.         
Get in. In back.

             WOMAN:             
          He's burnt.           
                   I seen it!   
                It's your fault!
   You drove on the wrong side  
 of the street and hit that guy!
   Drunk! Look at him,          
     stinking drunk!            
            He's full           
          of that stuff!        
       [CROWD CHATTERING]       
      Come on! Let me in.       
    I'm Ross of The Record.     
                     Yeah,      
               and you're drunk.
          Do you know you killed
               three people?    
   Yes, you.                    
        [ALL CLAMORING]         
You, Frank Ross, having been found guilty of the crime of manslaughter, it is now my duty to pronounce sentence.          
   I must add that the verdict  
           of the jury          
    has the court's heartiest   
           approbation.         
Nor can there be any excuse for leniency in your case, as you should be well aware.    
Since you have, in signed articles for The Record, often denounced drunken driving as the most ghastly of crimes,  
        a view with which       
    the court agrees entirely.  
    And when such drunkenness   
     results in the slaughter   
        of three young,         
innocent citizens, words become inadequate to express our horror.          
I was not drunk, and I was not driving that car. 
       [CROWD MURMURING]        
[GAVEL CRACKING]                
 Nor can we condemn too harshly 
    your vicious assertion      
        that you were---        
Framed. Yes, Your Honor, framed.
 By that eminent public servant,
     District Attorney Hanley   
         and his equally eminent
  and equally crooked assistant,
              Grayce.           
        Your Honor.             
I protest.                      
        Framed because they knew
          I could show them up  
           for the grafting rats
                 they are.      
  Frank, don't make it worse    
        for yourself.           
           All right.           
    You've done a great job.    
     You've discredited me      
         and my paper.          
You're putting me away, but you 
   can't keep me in the pen.    
      You'll never be able      
         to shut me up.         
         I'll get out,          
         and when I do,         
   I'll prove you responsible   
       for these murders.       
[CRACKS GAVEL]

    you are hereby sentenced

You can't come in here, lady.                  
        He's my son.            
I'm sorry.

Frank!                          
         [SOBBING]              
Darling, please write often.    
I'll just die if I don't hear from you.       
             I'll write as often
               as I can, baby,  
        as often as they let me.
      We'll get you out.        
They can't keep you in prison.  
  Kinda watch out for my mother,
             will you?          
     [TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS]      
MAN:                            
Every morning, when you wake up in your cell, just remember that the boys will be working their ears off for you.         
              Don't worry, Bill.
              I'll take it easy.
         And when I get out,    
     I'll have a story to write.
 They're a couple of reporters. 
      You know, smart guys      
    that are always writing     
   about "crooks are yellow"    
     and "crime don't pay."     
     The DA don't like that     
    because he knows better.    
      So he sends this guy      
          to the jug.           
  Won't be long. You'll be out  
      before you know it.       
Hmm. He's going in and out,     
      just like that.           
    Clever boys,                
  these reporters.              
Write a piece about me when you get out, will you?     
 The name is Stacey,            
   life sentence.               
I like to read my name          
    in the papers.              
  If you don't shut up, you may 
 find it in the obituary column.
Oh, my goodness. Hey, deputy,   
  will you change my seat?      
I don't like to play so rough.               
He run over a couple of guys,   
  so he thinks he's tough.      
You know how it is with the first couple of guys.  
       Ha! I don't think        
         he's so tough.         
        No?                     
              No.               
How tough are you, babe?        
                  That's good.  
                  That's good.  
        [MEN CLAMORING]         
If you get into trouble in here,
       you become second-       
    or third-grade prisoners    
   according to your offense.   
     More serious offenses      
         are punishable         
    by solitary confinement     
     or as we call it here,     
          "the Hole."           
     I don't recommend it.      
                 Obey orders.   
              Behave yourselves.
    Keep clear of troublemakers.
May I have a word with--?       
          Keep your arms folded.
          What do you wanna say?
I'm here on a political         
       frame-up.                
       I'm innocent too,        
          warden. I...          
 When a man is legally convicted
          and sent here,        
              we must assume him
                 to be guilty   
     and treat him on that basis
      alone. And another thing: 
      Talking is forbidden      
         in this prison         
        except during           
     recreation periods.        
     Don't forget that.         
       That's all.              
               Dismissed.       
              Left turn.        
      [MACHINERY RATTLING]      
New bunch of fish, huh?         
       Well, blow my top!       
   If it ain't the great Stacey,
          back here again.      
            Couldn't bear       
    to be without old Pete, huh?
               Same stupid puss,
                  only uglier.  
                What's he in for
                   this time?   
Hundred and ninety-nine years.  
       Well, now. That's kind of
        handsome of that judge, 
                     I must say.
   Throwed the book at you, huh?
         Well, well, well.      
           Now, just to show you
      what a real "welcome home"
           you're gonna get,    
         who do you think's here
        doing the book too, huh?

                     Hmm.       
          Thought that would get
             a rise outta you.  
                    [CHUCKLES]  
                     Hey, Limpy!
Limpy, come here!

Come here.                      
            Know this fella?    
He ought to know me, the rat.                        
I gave him that limp when he crossed me up in the Dannemora break.         
         Yeah, I know you.      
  And you ain't gonna forget me.
            Now, now, boys,     
             don't quarrel      
      on Mr. Stacey's first day 
           back in school.      
     Go on over to that breaker 
          and go to work.       
       We're gonna see a lot    
     of each other, you and me. 
              And Limpy.        
Get to your machine.            
Watch yourself.                 
   You go on over there and help
   those boys stack those bales.
               What's your name?
Frank Ross.                     
              Say "sir" when you
             address an officer.
             And fold your arms.
                  You hear?     
Go on over there and join Stacey at that breaker.
  [SOFTLY]                      
  Yes, sir.                     
                           MAN: 
                         Stacey.
           Pipe down,           
    I'll talk to you later.     
               Hello, you mugs. 
             Break out the band.
             Stacey's back.     
Well, for crying out loud--     
     Oh, just for a visit, boys.
          Just for a visit.     
This is Ross, mugs.             
 A gentleman from the press.    
         He's a killer,         
    so hang on to your hair.    
     Sorry we ain't got any     
  typewriters on this machine,  
       nor no yellow ink.       
                   What do I do?
Why, you flap your ears and wish you was a swallow.     
         When did Limpy come in?
     A month ago.               
              What is he in for?
Murder, second degree.          
   He's doing life.             
      You know it's Limpy or me,
              don't you?        
          It ain't gonna be me. 
        How much time you shook?
    Shook a trey.               
I'm out in two months.          
     Good. Keep your nose clean.
       See there's no slip-ups. 
                  I may need you
                 on the outside.
   Okay. Don't turn             
  your back on Limpy.           
He's got a knife stashed,       
    and he'll use it.           
                   Don't worry, 
                 I'll watch him.
          [BELL RINGS]          
    What was you talkin' about?!
                You hear me.    
     What was you talkin' about?
Why, Mr. Kassock, sir, uh...    
   ain't there a rule           
    against talking             
  in this young ladies'         
     riding academy?            
         Yeah! And you broke it.
            Limpy heard you.    
          What'd he say, Limpy? 
     I couldn't hear what he was
            saying, but--       
     Why, you no-good rat.      
                  HASSOCK:      
                  Stop it!      
            Stop it, I tell you!
   Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!   
   Get back to your machines,   
            you men!            
              All of you!       
          Learning kind of fast,
              ain't you, mug?   
I'm no mug, and I don't like to be called one.          
     Oh, you don't like it, huh?
    No.                         
  Well, there's a lot of things 
 gonna happen to you around here
     that you won't like either.
              Limpy.            
                Get me a deputy.
      We'll see if a month      
         in third grade         
         will take some         
    of that guff out of you.    
 Now, get over there and change 
   your clothes. Both of you.   
      Get back to your machines,
               you men!         
       I owe you one            
    for tripping Limpy.         
     It was screwy,             
       but good.                
                      Forget it.
Your first day in stir,         
and you tangle with Pete Kassock, the toughest screw              
  in the state.                 
And get his prize rat a sock on the noggin, and you lose your privileges    
        for a month.            
Oh, you got the makings         
    of a swell con.             
          Not me, brother.      
    I won't be here long enough.
Yeah, until you do leave us, let me give you a little advice.
 You know anything              
    about Limpy?                
                    No, not yet.
Well, remember this if you wanna stay healthy:      
He's the deadliest, most treacherous killer in this or any other pen.       
      Look out!                 
        [MEN CHATTERING]        
              MAN:              
        That's a homer.         
             MAN 2:             
  Hey, over the fence is out.   
         [MEN LAUGHING]         
         Well, Mr. Reporter,    
    how about that plan of yours
         for getting in and out?
        Seems to me, you've been
          in here 30 days now.  
And they turned down            
    your pardon.                
         Yeah.                  
That gives you a year and a half
 before you can even ask again. 
 Well, uh, the paper's working  
        on a new angle.         
 If they can get some evidence, 
    I can get another trial.    
You see what I mean, Ross?      
There I was keeping my nose clean and going straight for the first time in 20 years, and those dirty coppers have to put the pinch on me.    
And even with a bum rap, do I get a break and go to a decent stir like Stillwater or Sing Sing?   
    Oh, no.                     
 I have to fall                 
 in this state.                 
       It might have been worse.
     Suppose you started to run,
       and the cop slugged you. 
  Well, I'd sooner be slugged.  
       I'd sooner be dead       
  than live in this madhouse.   
Break your back working all day.
        Sit in your cell        
       until next morning       
       with nothing to do       
     but stare at the wall.     
   Screws going by, snooping.   
        Rats like Limpy.        
     First thing you know,      
       you're stir-nuts,        
       just marking time        
      till you can get out      
    and kill the first creep    
    that comes in your way.     
            I wonder            
   if the joint's getting me.   
               Don't let it     
          get you down, Meuller.
                  Keep your mind
                   off yourself.
              MAN:              
         Hey, you guys.         
Well, I'm collecting today      
      for a change.             
      Lassiter over there       
 claims that whales give milk.  
          Same as a cow.        
        Can you beat that?      
Certainly, numbskull.           
Whales aren't fish,             
 they're mammals.               
They give milk like any other animal.          
     Okay, whales give milk.    
But personally, I think you guys
     are still ribbing me.      
         Hey, Lassiter.         
          Come over here        
 and join the rest of the dopes.
Say, what's Lassiter in for?    
       Why, he just stole       
  a 100-pound sack of walnuts,  
      and he buried them.       
      Now, he sits around       
       worrying for fear        
  the squirrels might find it   
      before he gets out.       
            He worked in a bank.
           He accepted a deposit
                 from a guy     
          after he knew the bank
             was on the rocks.  
           It's what they call  
          a legal technicality. 
     Mm-hmm.                    
                  Hey.          
          What was this you were
                telling Red     
             about sharks giving
                cow highballs?  
             Whales, not sharks.
   And I was trying to tell him 
 that dogs don't have any pores.
Oh, where do you get that stuff?
      Sure they got pores.      
 How are they gonna sweat then  
         if they ain't?         
       Off their tongues.       
  I told you the guy was loco.  
                 [CHUCKLING]    
             Speaking of sharks,
                  watch it.     
     Get up off that dirt!      
     Where do you think you are,
         in some county jail?   
     Lassiter, look at you.     
  Wallowing around like a hog.  
Stand up and come to attention when an officer speaks to you.  
            I didn't know it was
             against the rules  
           to sit on the ground.
     Shut your trap.            
Another crack out of you, and I'll put you in the Hole.   
Any talking's to be done        
      around here,              
I'm the guy that'll do it.      
Fold your arms and salute when an officer speaks to you.  
       Everybody salute!        
          Bunch of cheap,       
          tinhorn crooks.       
      Never knowed nothing      
        and never will.         
        Watch your step,        
        the lot of you,         
       or I'll break you.       
        Show you tramps         
    who's boss around here.     
      Yes, sir, Pete's certainly
             one nice guy.      
          I'd like to meet him  
        on the outside sometime.
         I'll meet him,         
           all right.           
  Or maybe I won't wait until   
      I'm on the outside.       
       Thattaboy, Meuller.      
Let's hear what you'd really do.
    What would I do to Pete?    
 I'd cook him with a steam hose 
     until his hot carcass      
          fell apart.           
     I'd take a blowtorch!      
       I'd take a hammer!       
Shh!                            
                        Stop it.
    Just the thought of him     
  helpless in my hands makes--  
            Come on, pal.       
       Let's go watch the game. 
Got a feeling Meuller will really keep that date with Pete.
    Personally, I'll settle     
           for Limpy.           
Yeah, why?                      
   Maybe I don't like the way   
       he plays a piano.        
          Maybe I just          
       don't like stools.       
        You have to know        
        all the answers?        
 Stacey, I just been ratted on. 
       What about?              
          That can of soda you  
        slipped me this morning,
           they saw me using it.
Whoa, that means the Hole if they ever catch you.         
        Who ratted?             
          Limpy and that new pal
           of his, the Polecat. 
                    Why, those--
    What's wrong with soda?     
              Mix it with salt  
            and tobacco powder. 
                 It makes snuff.
                 It's forbidden.
          You got it?           
                           Yeah.
       Slip it to me.           
                           You? 
     You're going out           
on parole next week, and you can't afford to go      
 out of circulation now.        
I need you on the outside.      
   Slip it to me quick.         
    Mob around. Here.           
              Red, keep the shiv
               till I come out. 
   You other guys take a powder.
     Garsky, you stick with me. 
         Watch yourself, there's
         the captain of the Hole
                talking to Pete.
                Okay.           
There's Pete and Temple crossing to 'em now.            
Sure fixed Stacey's watchdog,   
          didn't I?             
           Nice work. Pipe down.
Well, I think those rats snitched on the wrong party     
        this time.              
              Who's the new rat?
Carlisle, better known          
     as Polecat.                
       He came in               
a couple days ago and started palling around      
  with Limpy right away.        
       Oh, yeah. Five years for 
     manslaughter. Heard of him.
Yeah, for manslaughter,         
      five years.               
    I steal a tire,             
     and I get 20.              
            Smells like he's got
            some pull somewhere.
             Come on, get going,
                   Stacey.      
There's something funny about this!               
You had it, all right.          
        Who, me, sir? No, sir.  
     I ain't that kind of a boy.
Hey, something went wrong.      
Puttin' Stacey away instead.    
      Never mind. I'll take care
       of him when he gets out. 
          Into the Hole he goes.
               Poor sucker.     
Aw, solitary never bothered     
Stacey. He can do it easily.    
       Yeah? Did you ever figure
          why screws like Pete  
               ain't bumped off?
         No, why?               
                This state's got
               no death penalty.
       So if you knock a guy off
                in here,        
        you do life in the Hole.
            And if that still   
         don't tell you nothing,
           take a gander at him.
 In the Hole, you're handcuffed 
        to the cell bars        
       eight hours a day.       
    No light, no furniture.     
          No heat in the winter.
                 Bread and water
                  only at noon. 
      That guy was a great joker
       when he first come here. 
                  He was always 
                ribbing at guys.
        They gave him six months
              in the Hole.      
              Just six months.  
            And look at him now.
      [MACHINERY RATTLING]      
I'm getting fed up with Pete.                      
 I'm getting fed up             
 working here.                  
I don't know if I can stand it any longer.            
        I'm fed up too.         
 Nothing we can do about it...  
            but wait.           
               I wish I'd stayed
                 home in Fargo. 
        Why'd you leave?        
         I was dogcatcher,      
  and they run me out of office.
         I didn't have the heart
         to kill them poor pups.
         I'd turn them loose    
    as fast as they was catched.
                        Oh...   
                Is that a ghost?
Well, we'll soon find out who wins the blood sweep now.   
                       You gonna
                      bet on it?
        I don't bet on one guy  
           killing another.     
                  That ain't it.
Limpy got a message in to Stacey
        that he'd get him       
     before he's out of the Hole

              But you gotta call
                   the hour.    
               I'll bet two cans
                   of tobacco   
             one of them gets it
               in seven hours.  
Give her a shot of oil up there, will you?             
                 Yeah.          
How'd they handle you?          
                 Can't kick.    
Need any soap or tobacco        
     or toothpaste?             
            No. Listen, Ross,   
         forget about that shiv.
    What shiv?                  
I don't know the meaning        
      of the word.              
                     This.      
I don't see any shiv.           
                   Okay, Ross.

                Hey, something's
                   the matter!  
                Quick, turn on  
              the lights! Quick!
        [MEN CLAMORING]         
            Turn on the lights! 
           Turn on those lights!
       They got one of the rats.
                Hooray!         
             Get them all,      
            the dirty finks!    
   That guy Limpy, he chokes    
  and flops out in the aisle.   
Sit down, sit down,             
     you men!

   Get back there.              
                 He was sitting 
               right next to me.
            Then all of a sudden
            he starts coughing. 
      And then, like I told you,
      he flaps out in the aisle.
             All right, men,    
         take him to the morgue.

     What's up?                 
         That paper you work for
           doing you any good?  
   They're trying.              
                You been in here
                  four months.  
Yes, but they've been fighting  
     the administration.        
   That doesn't help.           
                     A bum rap, 
                     wasn't it? 
 What's all this for?           
               Listen, Ross.    
            I didn't kill Limpy.
        All right.              
              Believe it or not,
                   I didn't.    
I meant to, but the screws searched my cell.
            So I passed the shiv
              on to another guy 
             who loved Limpy    
             just like I did.   
              So Limpy collected
               the next morning.
           Okay.                
             But that don't make
                no difference.  
           You thought I did it.
     A word from you, and I'd be
     doing the book in the Hole,
              and you'd probably
                 be pardoned.   
        I'm no rat.             
                I owe you plenty
                    for that.   
You don't owe me a thing.       
              And I'm gonna pay.
    Kid, did you ever figure out
         that if I was out,     
 I could find out who framed you
       and get you sprung?      
         How?                   
              I got connections.
         I can find out anything
             that's happened    
              by putting dough  
            in the right places.
So, uh, all we've gotta do is get you out of here?         
                       Jiggers. 
              Listen, Ross.     
         This is no screwy idea.
        I'm not so nuts I'd risk
          the book in the Hole  
              just to get rid of
                 another rat.   
                    Another guy 
                  beat me to it.
   But it works out the same.   
I'm using it to beat this joint.
Sorry, Stacey, you've gotta     
  start at the beginning.       
      All right. If you're up   
   for killing some guy in here,
                you're tried    
             in the courthouse. 
      I'm doing life, 199 years.
        So no pardon, no parole.
You can't crash over those walls
      in a million years.       
       The only chance is to get
           to the courthouse    
          and try it from there.
An army couldn't get you out of that courthouse.         
A lot of guys have tried it, and they've all been buried.    
            They tried it alone.
            They didn't plan it.
          Listen. Garsky and me,
    we figured this out together
           before he left.      
            I let someone snitch
                to the warden   
           that I sunk that shiv
                 in Limpy.      
                 I get indicted.
 Garsky follows the case through
   the papers or a mouthpiece.  
He knows the day I'm to be tried
       and the courtroom.       
                  He makes      
           all the arrangements.
        Mm-hmm.                 
And where do I come in?         
  You're the only guy I ever met
       that gave me a break     
   without putting the bee on me
             for dough.         
           So now I'm giving you
                  a break.      
   Go to the warden and tell him
     about me having that shiv. 
      No, no. No, Stacey,       
            I can't.            
    I could have saved Limpy    
       from being killed        
      if I'd used my head.      
       I've been thinking       
     of what I'd have done      
   if I were on the outside.    
         I'd have tried         
     to run the murder down     
    and slapped it all over     
        the front page.         
                  But you're not
                 on the outside.
          No, I'm not.          
 I'm in the pen and I'm a con.  
      But Limpy was killed,     
            murdered.           
   That still means something   
             to me.             
        No, Stacey, no.         
I can't help you to use a murder
    to make a break. Sorry.     
     No, no soap.               
     What's the matter with you?
       You going stir-nuts too? 
     This is a sure out for you.
                  Hey, dummy up.
              So there you are. 
            Where you been, huh?

         Yeah, that's as may be.
            You got visitors.   
      I ought to park your lazy 
    carcass in the Hole instead.
       Take it. Get out of here,
        before I change my mind.
         Face the wall.         
        Fold your arms.

        a trip to court?        
              No.               
Then cut out that staring into the visitor's room.        
And say "sir" when you address an officer.    
                      Yes, sir. 
            All right, Ross.

       to Pete when you go back.

                 It's all right.
We're trying so hard.           
We haven't let up a minute.     
                    Nothing new?
Only what I wrote you.          
      And they haven't been able
                 to get a line  
               on Shake Edwards,
      that man that was in front
     of the building that night?
Not a trace of him.             
             Mm, I'm sure he was
               the finger man.  
                 He was the one.
But we'll find him, Frank.      
A lot of the boys in the A.P.   
    are working with us.        
                             Mm.
Frank, I know you don't want your mother to see you here, but can't you forget that?      
                  No, no.       
But it's too cruel to keep her from visiting you.  
      I...couldn't say no.      
     I've brought her here.     
        Please see her.         
        Please, Frank.          
    You can't send her away.    
           All right, all right.
       All right, madam.        
                You shouldn't   
             have made the trip.
                   It's too far.
           Are you feeling well?
       Yes, I feel fine.        
                    That's good.
Your face is so thin and pale.                       
Are you quite sure you're all right?               
          Oh, yes, I feel great.
They let me bring you           
  something to eat.             
Everything you like.            
I got the ice cream across the street from a little shop.  
You never tell me anything about your work in your letters.
Is it terribly hard?            
                Oh, no.

           is, uh, take care

        and every now and then, 
        write a few articles    
           for the prison paper.
Oh, I'm so glad.                
We must be patient.

       Stacey.                  
                            Yes?
Will there be any shooting      
 down at the courthouse?        
                             No.
I don't want any more blood     
       on my hands.             
   Give me your word?           
             I give you my word.
               And I don't lie. 
    All right, Stacey,          
  I'll put in with you.         
                  Remember this.
     Afterwards, they may figure
          you were in on it     
      and throw you in the Hole.
            You may have to take
            a lot of punishment.
       I don't mind.            
           Now, don't break down
                and confess.    
              Once it's done,   
           keep your mouth shut.
             That's gonna be    
         the tough part of this.
       I know.                  
        You or any of those guys
              on the paper      
                 got any idea   
              on who framed you?
We have only one lead.          
Did you ever hear of Shake Edwards?               
                    Yeah, a rat.
Well, he was outside the building the night it happened. 
    He fingered me,             
    I'm sure of it.             
                  Shake Edwards?
         Mm.                    
               I'll find him,   
           and I'll get you out.
    No matter how tough it looks
        or how long it takes,   
               I'll get you out.
                    And legally.
 All right, Stacey.             
     Good luck.                 
                   So long, kid,
                    and thanks  
                 for everything.
        [BLOWS WHISTLE]         
           Can you get this out?
   Sure.                        
Will the other end              
     pay off?                   
                 Yeah. Watch it,
                  it's dynamite.
You know me, Mr. Ross.          
      So you're the smart fellow
       who didn't know anything 
 about the Limpy Julien killing.
 Answer the warden.             
           You better come clean
                  for once      
                and make it easy
                  for yourself. 
Open that ugly mouth            
      of yours                  
 before I knock you             
 through the wall.              
    There ain't much to say.    
 In other words, you admit it.  
        Come on, Stacey,        
       make a statement.        
   You haven't got a chance.    
                  Why, you--!   
          Here, here, stop that!
           Lang, kick 'em apart.
               Nice work, kid.  
                         Stacey!
                      Hold it.  
                        Hold it.
          I couldn't have wanted
            a nicer confession. 
           Take him to the Hole.
Keep your mouth shut about this around the yard.     
And watch out for yourself.     
Some of the inmates might not like you for turning Stacey in.          
     I had another reason.      
      I'm a newspaper man.      
      I wouldn't cover up       
       a murder outside--       
Get outta here.                 
      Get this, wise guy.       
        We bury the ones        
  that try to get outta here.   
    If you don't believe me,    
            try it.             
     MAN:                       
Here he is now.                 
       [CROWD CHATTERING]       
        Hello, Lockhart.        
     How's the mouthpiece?      
   Hello, Stacey.               
Not worried, are you?           
               Me, worry?       
            Why, we'll beat     
               this rap.        
              By a neck.        
That's Ross, eh?                
                 Yeah.          
I'll talk to him in a minute.                    
Hey, sit down.                  
                  I'm Lockhart, 
                Stacey's lawyer.
          If they wanna know    
     what we were talking about,
            say I was asking you
             if you were going  
          to identify that shiv.
               No, he hasn't got
                   a chance.    
             Open-and-shut case.
               Everything's set.
                After he's gone,
    he'll keep in touch with you
             through me.        
          That's all. Sit tight.
      How are you, deputy?      
How are you?                    
                 What'd he want?
Ah, the dirty fink.             
He wanted to know if I was certain                
I could still identify that shiv.             
                          Oh.   
                Well, don't talk
                 to him anymore.
  We'll send you the original   
    once it's in the paper.     
        You can only talk to him
              for a minute.     
       Thank you, deputy.       
              Ought to be a pip.
Oh, I hoped you wouldn't come, darling.     
This may be a mess.             
                 If it is,      
          I want to be with you.
               Frank, we've got 
              good news for you.
          I think we've located 
         Shake Edwards out west.
      Maybe you'll be home      
   before the month is over.    
That'd be great.                
           Spill it, what do you
              got us here for?  
               Yeah, what gives?
Come across, Frankie.           
It's a long way to come for a trial when The Record's got wire coverage.              
I was lonesome. I wanted        
  you to hold my hand.          
         Nix on the acking-cray,
                 Frankie.       
            Give us the lowdown.
 I can't. But listen.           
There'll be a story, a beat for The Record.          
Jerry, you grab shots           
    of everybody                
  in the courtroom              
  and every thing.              
Above all, keep your eye        
       on Stacey.               
    Don't look now,             
       you saps.                
         Come on, that's enough.
               Break it up.     
             I told you         
   you could only have a minute.
                  Thinking about
                  jumping, Ross?
            All right, go ahead.
      There's a nice stretch    
  of concrete three floors below
           that you can splatter
                yourself on.

 Don't worry, darling.          
     Don't worry.               
         No, I'm not worried,   
     but can he possibly escape?
I don't know. But listen,       
I'll probably get a pardon.     
If there's any cross up,        
need any advice, get hold of Stacey's            
 lawyer, Lockhart.              
You hear that? Lockhart.        
                      Mm-hmm.   
Aw, baby, it won't be           
    so long now.                
    He made it. A fine mess.    
       Yeah, he made it.        
Well, maybe Stacey made it, but we won't lose you, you dirty little rat.           
       Stay here and get        
      your story, darling.      
Come on.                        
     I'll write you Sunday.     
      Over there.               
                   Bring him in.
Where did Stacey lam to?        
                 I don't know.  
Don't lie to me, you little rat.                 
I've been handling hooligans like you for 25 years.          
Where is he?                    
         I don't know.          
Listen, Ross.                   
You're gonna talk if we have to bury you in the Hole for the next 20 years.          
With an added stretch for aiding an escape.           
Now, where did he go?           
                     I tell ya, 
                   I don't know.
          Wise-guy reporter, eh?
      Tell us what ya saw.      
It was on a Monday.             
Him and Stacey was behind a breaker, whispering together. 
Then they shook hands.          
And right after that,           
Ross told the warden            
Stacey killed Limpy.            
        You heard that?         
      Now what do you say?      
       He's a liar. I never said
       that Stacey killed Limpy.
          If Stacey had done it,
           he'd have covered up,
              and not sent me in
                to rat on him.  
Well, why did you stool then?   
You never opened your trap before.               
   I thought I might get a break
       from the pardon board.   
Listen, Ross,                   
          you are not           
     dealing with suckers.      
          That getaway          
    was planned months ago,     
 and timed right to the second. 
       You were in on it.       
     And another guy.           
Now, who was the other guy?     
                 I don't know   
              anything about it.
Oh, you don't know anything about it?              
Who filled the back of that truck with mattress padding so Stacey could jump?           
       I don't know, I tell you.
You don't know.                 
Who passed Stacey the signal so he'd know which window to jump from?      
You don't know that either, do ya?             
What kind of a car did they change to after they ditched the hot car down the road?      
You don't know.                 
Well, let me tell you something, you're doing a 20-year stretch.              
And if you don't talk, there'll be no pardon, no parole.           
You'll do that 20 years, every last second of it.        
Now will you spill?             
         I've told you          
       everything I know!

                  You stay here.
                           Well?
Well, he's guilty, ain't he?                       
How else you gonna make him sing?                  
            I've told you before
     that I will not tolerate   
 brutality in this penitentiary.
                 I've laid down 
                punishment rules
        that are fully adequate.
      And as long as I'm warden,
     those rules will be obeyed.
            And mark this, Lang,
             if there's any more
               of what went on  
         in here this afternoon,
               you'll go...     
       if I have to charge you  
     in criminal court to do it.
FRANK:                          
Let me outta here.              
             Just a minute.     
Let me out of here, do you hear?                    
We'll give you one more chance, Ross.          
If you give me the lowdown on Stacey's escape and tell me who helped him,     
         I'll let you outta here
              and give you      
        your first-grade stripe.
        You haven't got         
         a thing on me,         
      and you're not gonna      
     get a word out of me.      
       I don't know where       
       Stacey lammed to,        
    but I'm glad he made it.    
  I'm in here on a phony rap,   
    and you've got no right     
        to keep me here.        
   So get this, from now on,    
       the rules are off.       
  I'm gonna talk when I please  
      and do what I like.       
      I'm gonna be as mean      
  and dirty and hard to handle  
 as the worst con in the joint, 
      and I'll skull-drag       
        any rat or screw        
 that gets in my way, you hear? 
    Now, let me outta here,     
           you hear?            
   You muddle-headed copper.    
       Let me outta here!       
              Grayce, head      
          of the parole board?  
                    Of all      
              the rotten breaks.
        Why, that dirty         
         crook Hanley.          
    I'd like to get my hands    
          on that guy.          
Well, that certainly fixed it up
      for the kid's parole.     
What about that A.P. guy in Chicago        
that had a line on Shake Edwards?               
The finger man.                 
                 It fizzled out.
   Just like everything else    
          we've tried.          
       Just like Stacey.        
And Lockhart, that lawyer of his
      who promised to help.     
     No word from him, huh?     
                         Mm.    
For 20 years now,               
I've been a newspaperman, but I've never seen a case as shut as this.                
             Bill, we've got    
        to do something for him.
                We can't let him
                  sit up there  
           and rot in that hole.
Honey, I'd get down on my hands and knees and shove my face in the dirt from here to Rocky Point if it'd get the kid out.        
But there's a stone wall smack in front of us.           
We've got to wait until there's some kind of a break.           
      Well, we can't wait.      
  Frank can't wait any longer.  
      Bill, you don't know      
 what it does to him up there.  
We've got to think of some way. 
 We've got to do something now. 
           [SOBBING]            
You've got to let me see Stacey.
     Please, Mr. Lockhart.      
    You must take me to him.    
     Don't you understand?      
         Stacey's our last hope.
             He's got to see me.
        I could get you         
      into heaven easier.       
             However, I'll do   
         whatever I can for you.
Thanks, Mr. Lockhart.           
[KNOCK ON DOOR]                 
          Take the blinders off.
                Well, what's up?
       Stacey, you've got       
       to get Frank out.        
What do you want me to do, send him a pair of wings?       
      What's the matter with his
       friends at the newspaper?
               They're smart,   
                ain't they?     
           They kept him in,    
       they can work in reverse.
          I don't know          
   what you're talking about.   
Ross would.                     
He said he'd keep his trap shut, but he didn't.   
He tipped off his paper so the courtroom was crummy with reporters and photographers all waiting for the break.      
Oh, I never did like reporters.                 
Any one of them would put the finger on you.    
             He had to let      
            his paper know.     
          It was his instinct   
             as a reporter.     
Well, his instinct blew him right into the Hole, and I hope he rots there.       
                 You think      
          he double-crossed you?
I think he's like every other wise guy.           
He had to have a payoff before he'd dummy up.           
                 You don't think
                 there's anyone,
                   man or woman,
           that money won't buy,
                  do you?       
Well, is there?                 
  Look at Garsky.               
Look at Joe, that weasel with the punk cigar.            
  Look at Johnny                
   over there.                  
He gets paid just to look       
    out that window.            
Look at Lockhart.               
   Look at me.                  
      I am looking at you.      
    And it's making me sick.    
              What did you mean 
             by that last crack?
Cut it out.                     
      You can threaten me       
        if you want to,         
   but you can't shut me up.    
    You still make me sick.     
You're a blind, stupid, selfish,
  contemptible tinhorn crook.   
Now, listen--                   
       You listen to me.        
       Frank's been in that hole
            for five months     
       waiting to hear from you.
                     Do ya here?
        Five months of beatings,
       kickings and starvations.
            Trying to twist     
       and torture it out of him
    that you used Julian's death
     as part of an escape plan. 
           But he wouldn't tell.
                 Did you pay him
                  to keep quiet?
                        Did you?
           No.                  
      No, he kept his mouth shut
        because he trusted you. 
                   He thinks    
              you're his friend.
                He doesn't know 
              you never heard of
            that kind of loyalty
              money won't buy.  
                That you're just
                 a cheap hoodlum
                 who never did  
               one decent thing.
     Who ever done              
    anything for me?            
            Frank Ross.         
    He's doing it right now     
     in the Hole in Rocky Point.
You guys wait outside in the other room.              
                      All right.
Okay.                           
Lockhart.                       
                     Uh-huh?    
You stay.                       
Sit down.                       
If I could believe that, there ain't no place            
I wouldn't go for a guy like that.            
Nothing I wouldn't do.          
                 Why don't you  
              do something then?
            Frank is straight,  
         he is honest and loyal.
                 He's everything
                that you're not.
              Yes, I know.      
            Lockhart told me    
          you were a slum kid   
        who never had a chance, 
            but so was Frank.   
           He hates crooked cops
          and rotten politicians
         just as much as you do.
          The only difference is
                you chose crime,
                  the easy way. 
    While he spent his life     
         fighting them,         
   doing something about it.    
     That's why you've got      
        to help him now.        
Maybe you're on the level at that.              
I don't know.                   
Anyway, beat it along home, now.                
But you will--?                 
                How do I know?  
             I'll think it over.
        Put the blinders on her.
       Come on, you guys.       
     Tell her you're sorry      
       for getting tough.       
Who, me?                        
For crying out loud--           
        Go on, tell her.        
All right, I'm sorry.           
       See, he don't know       
           no better.           
             Go on.             
All right, Lockhart,            
      powder.                   
             Wanna sit in, boss?
It's the dame,                  
I guess.                        
They sure pour it on.           
              It's their nature.
             They can't help it.
    Is there anything wrong     
           with that?           
           Is there?            
              Why, no, chief.   
                  I only--      
         Shut up, then.         
           Now, look.           
       Ross may be dumb,        
  but he's on the level, see?   
         A square guy.          
        And I ain't used        
        to square guys.         
  So we gotta pick up the mug   
      that Ross is taking       
          the rap for.          
              How do we do that?
      First we pick up          
       Shake Edwards.           
       We gotta find him        
   and squeeze him a little.    
        Then Lockhart           
  can get Ross a new trial.     
                       But--    
         But what?              
    We'll talk it over first    
 and figure it out from there.  
  Well, what are you guys       
        waiting for?            
        Ya paralyzed?           
   Go on, scram out of here     
    and pick up that fink.      
                   Okay.        
  Like a bunch of tin crooks.   
           Hm.                  
       Imagine Stacey           
   working for the cops.        
   Huh. That's a hot one.       
I'm sorry, Miss Conover,        
I can only repeat what I've told you many times in the last five months.        
When he admits the truth--      
           But Frank had nothing
               to do with it.   
You know better.                
Look, this unusual photographic concentration on Stacey proves that The Record was tipped off beforehand.      
    And that tip would come     
  from only one source: Ross.   
       A former reporter        
        for The Record.         
      But that's just it.       
      He's a newspaperman       
       and naturally he--       
That's practically an admission, isn't it?         
                 You can't prove
                    that he--   
That's true.                    
Because we can't prove it,      
Ross might have been            
    out of the Hole long ago    
     except for his record      
        while in there.         
      Insubordination, violence,
            hunger strikes.     
       He's the most troublesome
           prisoner I've had    
      in 35 years of penal work.
But you can't blame him, warden.              
He never committed any crime    
 and naturally he resents--     
Oh, won't you please let him out
  and give him another chance?  
   We're uncovering new evidence
    of his innocence right now. 
    Yet how can he get a hearing
        if he's in the Hole?    
New evidence?                   
What do you mean?               
               Well, we've--    
            That is, his friends
              are on the trail  
      of the man who framed him.
You're in love with Ross,       
       aren't you?              
I'll trust you.                 
I'm gonna give Ross a break.    
      Have Ross brought into    
 the deputy's office right away.
         Come with me.          
                [FRANK SHOUTING]
Sit down here.                  
             FRANK:             
   You can't get me in there!   
       If I can just get        
  my hooks into your throat--   
Frank, darling, don't!          
                     Let him go.
                   Wait outside.
          What are you          
         starting now?          
    This some of your doing?    
Frank, don't.                   
                   Take it easy.
                    You're not  
                 gonna get hurt.
            But behave yourself.
           Ross, when you first 
          came here, I thought--
          I don't care          
       what you thought.        
When I first came here,         
I believed in justice.          
I believed that some day        
    I'd be released.            
Then I began to figure in weeks, then months.          
    And now I hate everybody    
       in the whole world       
  for letting me in for this.   
 Buried in a black, filthy hole 
 because I was a good citizen.  
Because I worked my head off    
      to expose crime.          
And now I'm a convict.          
I act like a convict, smell like a convict.           
   I think and hate             
   like a convict.              
   But I'll get out.            
I'll get out if I have to kill  
  every screw in the joint.     
                Now, that'll do.
       Yeah. It'll do.          
      You bet it'll do.         
 Go on, kick me, beat me up,    
 throw me back in the Hole.     
       I can take it.           
              You brought a lot 
             of this on yourself
                  by throwing in
                   with Stacey. 
Mm. Starting that again, huh?   
                I'm not guessing
                   this time.   
                         I know.
I told him, Frank.              
               You what?        
Frank, I didn't mean to, but--                  
   Why, you--                   
                You'd better not
                  say it, Ross. 
                 You'd better   
              thank her instead.
     For what?                  
Getting me another 10 years     
       in the Hole?             
        For getting you a break.
       What Miss Conover told me
           is off the record.   
     And I'm giving you a chance
        to measure up to her.   
            Think you can do it?
            I'm sending you back
                to the Hole.    
I knew there was a catch in it.                  
               There's no catch.
         If you behave yourself,
           you'll come out      
     with a good-conduct report,
      all set for a fresh start.
A clean slate?                  
                  In 30 days,   
              if you deserve it.
     The pardon and parole board
             meets again        
         in two months from now.
         And if you'll stay away
           from troublemakers,  
             I'll recommend you 
            to the board myself.
                  But you've got
                    to earn it. 
                What do you say?
        [SOBBING]               
      [MACHINERY RATTLING]      
     Lassiter doesn't look      
            so good.            
   How's he been making out?    
Pete rides him all the time.                   
He's getting weaker and weaker and still the croaker in the hospital keeps sending him back.         
The only thing that pill-pusher 
 can diagnose is rigor mortis.  
                   Sounds bad.  
                 Is it catching?
       Did you tell him?        
I didn't wanna get him down about his parole.               
                      What's up?
     We got it all planned      
          to lam out.           
              You'll all wind up
                in the morgue.  
              Red, you're not   
           putting in with them?
Sure am.                        
  The parole board will probably
       give you your ticket.    
   Yeah, and it's gonna read,   
    "Continued to expiration    
         of sentence."          
 Look, I ain't kidding myself,  
       so why should you?       
       If I miss with the board,
            I've got Stacey.    
Stacey. Yeah, we all thought    
he was a right guy until he lammed out             
   and left you.                
Have you heard from him?        
                       No, but--
Them bigshots is all alike.     
Why should he think of you,     
when he's rolling in that hundred grand?          
        He'll do something soon.
Wait'll he catches those creeps.
     Yeah, yeah.                
       Come on! Come on,        
       get back to work!        
Come on, step on it,            
     all of ya!                 
That goes for you too.          
What's the matter with you?                       
Let go of him.                  
Let go of him,                  
I tell ya!                      
Listen, you ain't gonna get away with no more goldbricking.      
Dragging that dead carcass of yours off to the hospital every time you think you got a little pain.          
          I'm really sick, Pete.
         I feel kind of dizzy,  
       like I'm floating around.
You will be floating around if you don't get back           
  to that machine.              
Hear what I told ya?            
Get back to that machine!       
Get back!                       
   Come on, you lead-slinger.   
        You ain't hurt.         
      Cut it. Cut it, you.      
            Cut it.             
 Don't you butt in, you'll only 
     make it worse for him.     
Come on, get up.                
You ain't--                     
                  Take him      
              to the hospital.  
                   And listen!  
          He fell over a machine
             accidental-like.   
              Don't forget that,
               if you guys know 
             what's good for ya.
                     Now, go on,
      get back to your machines!
                     All of you!
                Or I'll book ya!
     It's a good thing Pete     
     ain't a crystal gazer.     
     If he was, he wouldn't     
       sleep much nights.       
                  Move up, boys.
        [CLOCK TICKING]         
                   All right.   
           Sit down, Ross.      
How are you feeling?            
             I feel pretty well.
So you're the man               
who gets drunk and kills innocent people       
 with his car, are you?         
            I guess you know me.
           You were at my trial.
Oh, feeling a little troublesome this morning, eh?               
After all, we're here to release men who feel properly penitent      
and show a desire to lead a decent life in the future.    
              I've never led    
         any other kind of life.
               You know that.   
Oh, no. All we know is what is a matter of record.  
  Do you still contend          
  that you're innocent?         
                  Yes.          
Well, then, you haven't         
    any use for us.             
We're only interested in men who acknowledge their guilt and wish to atone.              
   What do you want me to do?   
   Do you want me to confess    
 to a crime I never committed?  
I'd stay here the whole 20 years
      before I'd do that.       
    Why did you help Stacey     
           to escape?           
           I didn't.            
 It's all here in your record.  
        You haven't been        
     a very good influence      
  for the rest of the inmates,  
   and it might not be proper   
  to turn you loose on society  
        just at present.        
You've got to realize that you can't get drunk and drive around killing people.                 
It's murder, as your admirable paper once pointed out, just as surely as if you used a loaded gun.    
      I didn't, I didn't.       
        That's not true,        
        and you know it.        
 Then there's your record here. 
      Insolence to a guard      
       on your first day.       
Disobedience and insubordination in the solitary cells.          
Does that record merit any consideration from us?      
         Yes, it does.          
 Well, we don't agree with you. 
    Warden Armstrong reports    
       that your conduct        
     has improved of late.      
But the reason is obvious.      
To curry favor with the board in hope of release.             
           Speak up.            
  Haven't you anything to say?  
  Yes, I'd have plenty to say   
  if I could think of anything  
   scummy enough to call ya,    
       you sanctimonious,       
  mealy-mouthed lot of skunks.  
    I'll meet you on the outside
              someday.          
    It may be 20 years from now,
           but when I do!       
                        [LAUGHS]
           [SOBBING]            
       I'm sorry.               
   I didn't mean what I said.   
          Oh, please,           
    give me another chance.     
   I just couldn't stand it.    
          Couldn't...           
   I can't do any more time.    
  Please, turn me out of here.  
 We'll do what we can for you.  
         Go along now.          
Next man.                       
         I don't know.          
I don't know anything about it. 
  Honest. I didn't have anything
          to do with it.        
       That's the truth.        
 You gotta believe me, fellas.  
                 I'm waiting.   
I don't know.                   
Don't, Stacey, don't.           
All right, I'll tell!           
                 Spill it!      
It was Carlisle,                
Polecat Carlisle.               
Hanley had him do it.           
I didn't have no part in it.    
I just fingered him.            
I didn't know what they was gonna do with him.
You can't blame me.             
                       Polecat. 
Yeah. He's at Rocky Point.      
             I oughta know that.
     Hanley and Grayce got him  
      picked up for an old rat  
            and sent there      
       to get him outta the way 
          because the papers    
           was getting hot.     
It's like having him put in a safe.                  
       Yeah. That's all I know. 
         You can't blame me.    
        In Rocky Point.         
No wonder you couldn't find him.
The old homestead.              
So now what?                    
        So, what do you suppose?
             I promised the girl
             we'd find that fink
       and clear Ross, didn't I?
           Well, we did.        
   Now we gotta get to Carlisle.
                  Is that right?
    Duck soup.                  
You take off the kelly at the front door and say,      
"Please, sir, can I see         
Mr. Polecat Carlisle?"          
It's too hot.                   
And supposin' we do find the guy?             
Where's the payoff?             
               Yeah, the payoff.
        Why don't you forget it,
                 Stacey?        
    What difference does it make
      if you promised the girl? 
    What do you care about Ross?
              We can't help it  
           if Polecat's in stir.
     We'll just fool around     
         at Rocky Point         
        and get paid off        
   with a slug in the belly.    
     And I ain't taking it      
      for Ross or nobody.       
    Okay.                       
If there was only a half a chance, Stacey.        
Listen, don't do nothing foolish.                
If you get picked up now, you're gonna spend the rest of your life in the Hole.       
     Yeah, I thought of that.   
     I don't blame you guys     
     for laying down on me.     
    But do something for me,    
            will ya?            
    Sure.                       
Yeah, what?                     
        Get out of here.        
 I don't like the way ya smell. 
       Go on, all of ya.        
          Come on, beat it.     
           I guess I'm a sucker,
     but I just can't get it out
              of my nut.        
     Ross doing all those months
             in the Hole        
        just to cover up for me.
   But still, he didn't have to,
              did he?           
No, he didn't have to.          
        Remember what Ross' dame
         said that day about...?
   About Ross and me wanting    
 the same thing all our lives,  
  and he was doing something    
          about it--?           
                Yep, I remember.
                 What about it? 
I think she had something there, so--   
                        So what?
So maybe I better do something about it.          
              Don't be a fool.  
           If you're picked up--
Shut up! Where did you ever get the idea I was a fool? 
I broke out of that pen once,   
          didn't I?             
And I can do it again.          
Now, listen, Stacey, you can't--
You heard me, shut up.          
You do the listening,           
I'll do the talking.            
And pay attention.              
Because if there's any slip-up  
on your part of this, you'll answer to the boys       
         for it.                
  Now, here's the gag.          
Get word through to Dale.       
               [CAR APPROACHING]
 It's okay, I didn't print it.  
           [EXHALES]            
             Hey! It's Stacey!  
   Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
            What do I gotta do, 
           fight my way back in?
            Come on!            
And you won't say why you came  
  back and gave yourself up?    
You know what it means.         
                  What is this, 
                a guessing game?
       According to rules,      
 it means the book and the Hole,
                 but not for me.
                I only came back
                for the weekend.
 You made it out once, Stacey,  
 but you'll never do it again.  
                   We'll see    
               how it works out.
  Now, do I get that plush-lined
   cell in solitary, or don't I?
  All right.                    
Everything set for the break?   
            Yeah.               
    You coming in with us       
           or not?              
        I don't love life much, 
      but I don't hate it enough
          to stick my head      
   in front of a screw's bullet.
 Be a wise guy.                 
Stick around here and maybe it won't be           
  a screw's bullet.             
Maybe you'll get what Lassiter got.              
            What about Lassiter?
He's on his way home.           
                     Home?      
Out the back gate in a hearse.  
               When'd it happen?
Four o'clock this morning.      
                   Poor guy.    
           Anybody told Meuller?
    No.                         
None of the guys wanted to break it to him.      
          Wait till he hears it.
Yeah, I wouldn't wanna be Pete. 
For the last time, are you coming in with us or not?       
    I told ya no, and I mean no.
     Oh, you're stir-nuts.      
He don't know what he's saying. 
Aw, come on, Frank, get wise to yourself.           
                 Lay off, Red.  
               Will you lay off?
      Stacey's on the outside.  
   I'm sure he's working for me.
   I'll take my chance that way.
 Tough luck, kid.               
      [MACHINERY RATTLING]      
    Jiggers.                    
Meuller, you can't beat this joint!                
You have no chance!             
              Let me go!        
Meuller, why ain't you at work?          
 Get back to your machine.      
                      [SPITS]   
    Get over agin that wall.    
              I'm gonna bury you
                 in the Hole.   
        You hear what I told ya?
        Get over agin that wall.
So you're the guy that wouldn't let Lassiter go to the hospital?
I'll put you where he is, if you don't keep away from me. 
And you're the guy that made him
   fall and busted his back!    
        Get over agin that wall!
And you're the guy that's been riding me to the nut house!     
   Stop him! Somebody, stop him!
            He's crazy!         
                  Get him away! 
                 Get the warden!
And you're the dirty screw      
   that killed my pal!          
                 [YELLING]      
         [MEN YELLING]          
            MEULLER:            
  That's for all the guys you   
  beat up and put in the Hole!  
      And that! And that!       
   And this is for Lassiter!    
         [MEN SILENCE]          
        [MEN MURMURING]         
    We're crashing out!         
   Who's coming with us?        
           [CHEERING]           
           Come on!             
           I don't know what    
            he's wanted for,    
    but I was told to bring him 
          along by Stacey.      
       Come on, get going.      
         [MEN YELLING]          
       Come on, Ross.           
        We need ya.             
 You're all crazy, men.         
     Don't try it!              
They'll blast you before you get to the gate!     
Don't be suckers.               
 Stay out of it!                
      If I didn't know you were 
       stir-nuts, I'd blast ya! 
 Come on, Red. Bring him along! 
            Come on!            
         [MEN YELLING]          
    Don't be like that, pal.    
Come on, this is gonna be swell.
   Look, I got a nice little one
            for you too.        
                 Come on.       
        [SIREN WAILING]         
         [HORN BLOWING]         
There. You're out of it anyway. 
      [GUARDS CHATTERING]       
 Men, stay out of it.           
  Don't be suckers.             
  You can't fight machine guns  
         and riot guns.         
 Go back to your machines,      
         you hear--             
                 Get going!     
Come on! Let's go!              
              MAN:              
    No, I won't go in there!    
         [MEN SHOUTING]         
                 We're heading  
               for the warden's!
          There he is!          
         [MEN SHOUTING]         
        Lock the door, get in   
    the mailroom and stay there.
          Pull 'em up!          
                   You're crazy.
         Put up those guns, men!
   I'm giving the orders now.   
        You're taking us        
      through them gates!       
            You're digging      
     your own graves, you fools!
        You do what we tell you,
        or you're digging yours.
         [MEN SHOUTING]         
           [GUNSHOT]            
Listen, bigshot, you saw what Pollard just got, so order them gates to open up and take us to the car, or I'll blow your hair all over the ceiling.           
                 You haven't got
                the nerve, Dale.
                  You can't     
             get away with this.
         You'll spend the rest  
       of your life in the Hole.
You got 10 seconds to find out whether I got the nerve.        
        Ten seconds or 10 years,
          the answer will always
               be the same.     
Listen, you dirty rats in there.
If these gates ain't open in 10 seconds,                  
I'm killing Armstrong just like Pollard!              
     Is that right, warden?     
     Did they kill Pollard?     
        Never mind.             
   Don't open the gates.        
       Get on the phone.        
      Call for extra help.      
        We have, warden.        
     It's on the way, sir.      
This is it, Armstrong.          
   Don't you need the warden    
             to make 'em open up
                the solitary?   
Yeah, yeah, that's right.       
I oughta give it to you now, but I got a date to keep        
with Stacey, and you're opening it up        
        for him.                
You're heading for the Hole.    
                   Not a chance.
         [MEN CHEERING]         
Get them keys, or I give it     
   to Lang on the spot!         
      All right, men, all right!
              All right!        
         I'll open up.          
              MAN:              
          Step on it!           
             Quiet, boys, quiet!
        Meuller, Johnny, Ross,  
          you come with us.     
           Carr, you stick here.
I told you, I didn't want       
    any part of this.           
         [MEN SHOUTING]         
           Quiet! Oh, we get it.
                   You want     
             the warden to think
          you're too good       
   to stick with your pals, huh?
No, I don't wanna make          
  the Hole for life.            
               Listen, Ross.    
    Get moving or I'll bump you,
        Stacey or no Stacey.    
              MAN:              
            Come on!            
         [MEN SHOUTING]         
   Come on. Move aside, Ross.   
             They're all screwy.
I'm glad you use your head.     
          I'll make my own break
           when the time comes. 
            So the picnic is on.
    This is it.                 
And there's Polecat,            
  like you asked.               
I'll get to him later.          
 Hello, Frankie. I been waiting 
  to see you for a long time.   
        I got a surprise for ya.
                All right, boys.
                   Right here.  
          [EXPLOSION]           
           [GUNFIRE]            
             Dale!              
            They threw gas bombs
           in through the gates.
           All the guys ran up  
         in the north cell hall.
       Now, the National Guard's
               out there        
               with machine guns
                 and gas masks! 
      Did I say a picnic?       
You two guys get in that cell.  
            Okay.               
    Why don't we give it to them
             right now?         
We may need 'em later.          
           [GUNSHOTS]           
     Any of you guys got a shiv?
           He's got one.        
Swell. Screws with machine guns all over the joint.        
                We'll make out. 
                      Out where?
                  Why, through  
                 the back door. 
We pick the screws off the wall,
           get some rope        
  at the twine mill and lam out!
                       Let's go!
            STACEY:             
  Come on, get going. Come on.  
              You guys go ahead.
What about you?                 
           Don't worry about me.
               I'll make out.   
I got something to take care of.
        Go on, beat it.         
           Put him in that cell.
                 He's done.     
[GUNFIRE]                       
     We all go together, Stacey.
          You got any ideas?    
If you know any prayers,        
   don't say 'em now.           
They won't do you any good.     
Come on, I got some unfinished business to take care of with the warden.                
      Write a note.             
   Tell 'em we'll release       
        you and Lang            
  if they let us out alive.     
Release 'em?                    
Write 'em, we'll knock you both off in 10 minutes if they don't quit firing.      
       My orders in case of riot
          are to keep firing,   
        regardless of the safety
       of any official or guard.
        Those orders will stand.
           [GUNFIRE]            
Stay on the floor, and you won't get hurt.         
       Maybe.                   
           [GUNFIRE]            
 Take that undershirt off.      
We'll show 'em a white flag.    
Here's a chance for you to be a hero.           
Take this note over to the twine mill.         
And if you lose it, tell 'em to stop firing.        
We give up.                     
             I ain't going.     
       I don't wanna get killed.
           What do you wanna do,
               live forever?    
       Here, give it to me.     
  Come on, Dale. Open that door.
           [GUNSHOTS]           
           [GUNFIRE]            
           [GUNFIRE]            
           Looks like           
     they don't wanna play.     
            How bad are you hit?
     Oh, it's just a nick.      
              Anything I can do?
        No, thanks, Frank.      
           [GUNFIRE]            
They'll be blasting it open     
       pretty soon.             
      Stacey, the riot's a bust.
       Get back in your cell    
   while there's still a chance.
No, won't do me no good now, kid.               
I still got that Limpy rap      
hanging over me, even though it was--            
          [EXPLOSION]           
It wasn't my job.               
  I wouldn't appear against you.
    I know it.                  
It's no use, Frank.             
This is the last roundup        
      for Stacey.               
           [GUNSHOTS]           
But there's still that unfinished business of yours to take care of.                
                It's still okay.
Where's Polecat?                
     Over there.                
I wanna talk to him.            
            Didn't I tell ya    
        I had a surprise for ya?
            Come on.            
 I ain't got no time to waste.  
Funny, just an hour ago,        
    I had 199 years.            
And now I ain't got             
  no time at all.               
               I'll get the rat.
           [GUNSHOTS]           
     We got an affidavit        
from Shake Edwards before I came back in here.     
           What about those guys
               who framed me?   
               Did you get them?
             Yeah.              
               Well, rat.       
       So it caught up with you.
   I didn't do nothing.         
I don't know what you're talking about.      
       Stacey, put up that gun  
       and listen. You're sunk. 
    I know it, big boy.         
   I just want you to listen    
 to what this rat's gotta say.  
Remember what happened to Limpy?
     In about two minutes,      
    you're gonna get worse.     
   Honest, Stacey.              
I ain't done a thing.           
   In two minutes, you're gonna 
  get this .38 between the eyes.
   Don't shoot me, Stacey!      
I didn't never snitch on you.   
     I ain't talking about      
      you snitching on me.      
  I'm talking about something   
 I learned from Shake Edwards.  
     No, I don't know nothing.  
 I'm talkin' about you framin'  
     Ross into this joint.      
Honest. We never framed him.    
    [SCREAMS]                   
       Start talking.           
          I can't. I don't know.
          Wait, wait. I'll talk.
 Okay. This is a confession     
     without coaching.          
 And it's gonna spring Ross,    
       so remember it.          
  Okay, canary. Start singing.  
                Who framed Ross?
I did. But I didn't mean nobody to get killed.           
               Quit stalling.   
           Who paid ya to do it?
Hanley and Grayce.              
 How did you frame him?         
              I socked his head.
 Then planted the liquor        
       in the car.              
                           Yeah.
Then started the car and then jumped out.            
Yeah, I did, but I didn't mean  
  to have nobody get killed.    
           [GUNFIRE]            
          Have you heard enough?
Plenty, Stacey. And thanks.     
               Okay, pal.       
       That's just what I hoped.
           [GUNSHOTS]           
          [EXPLOSION]           
           I'm all right, Frank.
Stacey, you can't wash out      
        on me now.              
       I need you.              
I'll get you out of here.       
     I'm going out, pal. My way.
     I wanna tell you something.
           [GUNFIRE]            
   That dame of yours is the one
      that sprung ya, not me.   
           Take care of her.    
            She's worth it.     
         I think I can hold 'em!
  No hurry now, Dale.           
        So long, kid.           
       Now we're even.          
               So long, Stacey. 
  Come on, you. On your feet.   
       Honest, Stacey, honest.  
         It wasn't my fault.    
      I told ya I didn't want   
          anybody killed.       
Get moving.                     
        Where you taking me?    
You didn't think                
I was gonna let you live and welsh on that confession, did ya?                         
           No, no. Let me alone!
               Let me alone!    
         Please, Stacey, please!
           [GUNFIRE]            
             So long, old-timer.
           I guess if you hadn't
          socked me on the chin,
                I'd be laying   
            in the icehouse now,
                 along with Dale
                  and the rest. 
           I-- Gee, I don't know
                what to say.    
     Never mind, Red.           
 You'll be out yourself         
      before long.              
                      Thanks.   
                 So long, Frank.
It oughta make up for what you've gone through in here,    
Ross, to know that it hasn't been in vain.         
The day Stacey came to me and gave himself up,            
I asked him why he was throwing away his freedom.      
I didn't fully understand all he tried to tell me, but it was something about you living the rest of your life for him as he might have lived it himself if he'd had the right breaks when he was a kid.              
        Then he asked me        
  for a photograph of himself.  
          Here it is.           
                   Frank.       

- This must end!
- L agree.
Then get started.
We didn't wait for rou
to go after pépé.
- And the result...
- what?
Pépé le moko is still at large.
Algiers isn't pigalle.
In pigalle, he'd have been behind bars long ago.
You'll think otherwise when you understand the situation.
Our people in paris don't see why le moko's so untouchable.
- Your people are funny.
- This can't go on any longer.
Arresting pépé in a place like the casbah isn't child's play.
It takes time.
- Time!
He's eluded you for two years.
And it's cost us five detectives.
Too high a price for so little.
True. But don't forget he got here the day after the toulon bank job.
Remember?
Sure, the machine guns, the car chase, and two million gone.
That's when you should've intercepted him.
The continental police are so "organized"!
Hello, chief.
Meet inspectorjanvier from paris.
L know.
Carry on.
L was explaining our failure to catch pépé le moko.
There's one reason you in paris can't understand:
The casbah.
Just as l said.
L'll go up there tomorrow to see how the land lies.
"How the land lies."
Funny!
The casbah is like a labyrinth.
L'll show you.
You can say pépé's gone underground.
From the air,
the district known as the casbah
looks like a teeming anthill,
a vast staircase where terraces
descend stepwise to the sea.
Between these steps are dark,
winding streets like so manr pitfalls.
Ther intersect, overlap,
twist in and out,
to form a jumble of mazes.
Some are narrow, others vaulted.
Wherever rou look,
stairwars climb steeplr like ladders,
or descend into dark, putrid chasms
and slimr porticos,
dank and lice-infested.
Dark, overcrowded cafés.
Silent, emptr streets with odd names... l nadequacy st.
Soum soum st.
Honey hotel st.
Man with a pearl st.
Apopulation of 40,000
in an area meant for 10,000.
From all over the world.
Manr, descended from the barbarians,
are honest traditionalists,
but a mrstery to us.
Kabrles.
Chinese.
Grpsies.
Stateless.
Slavs.
Maltese.
Negroes.
Sicilians. Spaniards.
And girls of all nations,
shapes and sizes.
The tall.
The fat.
The short.
The ageless.
The shapeless.
Chasms of fat
no one would dare approach.
The houses have inner courtrards,
which are like ceilingless cells
that echo like wells
and interconnect
br means of the terraces above.
Ther're the exclusive domain
of native women.
But europeans are tolerated.
Ther form a citr apart,
which, step br step,
stretches down to the sea.
Colorful, drnamic,
multifaceted, boisterous,
there's not one casbah
but hundreds.
Thousands.
And this teeming maze is what pépé calls home.
Catching him is no piece of cake.
He's well protected.
He has his gang.
Every crook is his accomplice.
News travels from terrace to terrace.
No need for newspapers.
He has spies on every rooftop.
Doors open and close, and no one knows why.
Guns go off by themselves.
He has friends where we have enemies.
Ask inspector slimane.
The devil's son always works with demonic children.
Le moko?
A prince of plunder.
Fifteen convictions, 33 daylight robberies, two bank holdups.
And burglaries?
We haven't enough fingers in this room on which to count them all.
How could he not be admired?
And such a good boy!
He wears his heart on his sleeve.
As quick with a smile for friends as a knife for foes.
So charming!
- Slimane sees him daily in the casbah.
- And you don't arrest him?
L have my plan.
In the casbah, he'd kill me without blinking.
L'm tolerated.
That's something.
- You're too lazy to worry him.
- L watch out.
- For your hide.
- L've only one!
We'll clean up the casbah tonight.
We'll get him dead or alive.
Nice, very nice.
Nice, very nice.
This gem is a tribute to your taste and expertise, pépé.
Can it! How much you offering?
- You're like a fidgety coquette.
- We're talking dough.
Carlos, my friend, your words fail to shine likejapanese pearls.
Slang is a phony language.
Cut the gab!
Cough up the bread!
You talk like a baker.
This ruby has such sex appeal!
My dear pépé, this burglary does you credit.
What's on your mind?
- Nothing.
My palm looks like an oyster shell.
It hurts to part with this, grandpa.
L can't take my eyes off this beauty spot.
- What's your offer, grandpa?
- Let him think.
He thinks, we lose.
Grandpa's a friend.
And for two years now.
L've always been behind your company.
Your mistrust offends me.
- Well said, grandpa!
- Sure, stick up for him!
You're not straight!
- Not straight?
- No!
You should've seen him slice up some fox stoles with a razor!
- A razor?
- A real vandal!
A what? Repeat that!
Real sabotage. You pain me.
What? Say that again!
You pain me.
He says you pain him.
L got it.
L was a cabinetmaker as a kid so l respect good craftsmanship.
L don't go slicing up fox stoles.
L snatch them, that's all.
And l know my place.
Right, jim?
Right, max?
Right, pierrot?
- And how, pépé.
Sure, they always say you're right.
- L'm square with them.
- And l ain't?
You've got business on the brain.
"Fork it over!"
You're no man, but a cash register.
- A what?
Come now, gentlemen, be civilized.
L got it.
Police!
No, régis. Let me in!
Where's pépé?
We have to warn him.
A busload of cops.
Like a wedding party after the groom.
- So soon?
- You were expecting them?
It's about yesterday's jewel robbery.
L'll warn him.
- Where is he?
- At grandpa's. He's safe.
What a relief!
L was in such a sweat.
L could almost see him handcuffed like a two-bit hood.
You're sweet, régis.
- L'm a sensitive fellow.
- But pépé's not your friend.
Well, l'm his, even if he doesn't like me.
But one day, l'll prove myself.
L'm not a talker, but l admire him so discreetly he'll have to take notice someday.
- Thanks, régis.
- Good luck, inès.
L'll go over the terrace.
Seen pépé le moko?
Me? Never heard of him.
Look out! Police!
Pépé, it's me.
Régis sent me.
The police are closing in.
- Can't we think in peace?
- Let's scram!
Where's the fire!
We've seen cops before.
Where are you going?
- To get a look.
- Not you, pierrot.
- Don't you trust me?
- Not you, l said.
- There's no risk!
You're too young.
It's régis.
He's at grandpa's.
The corner house.
They're coming here.
- Someone squealed.
- No.
Sure. Someone knew l was here.
You're imagining things.
- You saw someone.
- L saw régis.
- So you saw régis.
- He warned me.
- L'm fond of you.
- Why do you say that?
Because you're a child.
L think your activities don't allow you to stay here.
Shove over! They've got a shooting gallery mentality.
Let me through!
Quick! In here!
Stay here, my beauty.
You might get hurt outside.
- What's going on?
- Oh, nothing much.
Nothing? You're funny.
The police are after a man.
Don't bother!
They're not the talkative kind!
Relax, l won't hurt them.
L aim at the legs.
Good for varicose veins.
Four so far!
- Four varicose veins?
- No, cops!
- Are you hurt?
- It's nothing.
Give me that!
Stay here.
- You're hit?
- Just a flesh wound.
One! Two! Three!
She counts so nicely!
Tell them to hold their fire.
And you run on home!
Your place is at home.
- You saw nothing.
- What can l have seen?
- You heard nothing.
- L'm one-eyed and going deaf.
Doesn't the noise bother you?
L'm used to it.
- Have they been after him long?
- Two years.
- The police are so stupid.
- Aren't they?
- Don't you agree?
- Absolutely. Especially tonight.
Where does he live?
Just opposite?
Sometimes in here on the side of the heart, sometimes, the other.
Home is wherever he finds a woman.
Here, he's the caid's caid.
Caid?
The boss.
His favorite is inès, a gypsy.
Don't say it so loud.
When he's killed, there will be
3,000 widows at his funeral.
Patch me up, angel.
Not with them, slimane?
Hasty work is sloppy work.
Shouia. slow is better.
- Don't like to brawl, my little beagle?
- No, my little fox.
Excuse us if we talk shop, ma'am.
Cigarette?
L won't say no.
Let me help you.
So, they surrounded the house?
Funny, they thought l was at grandpa's.
He can't even sleep in peace anymore.
So you fired at them?
- A few pot shots.
- At the legs, as usual.
L love ninepins.
But they won't get me this way.
- L couldn't agree more.
- You see!
You see, we finally agree on something.
L'll get you, pépé.
But in my own way.
If god is willing.
- L can't wait!
L'll get the others, too.
Pierrot, carlos, jimmy, max, the lot.
And alive.
- For the zoo?
- You're not rare enough animals.
- That's not nice.
You're gutter lions.
L'll catch you with my bare hands.
Without props.
Think so?
It's written.
Shouia.
Slowly. By attrition.
You're not big enough, sonny.
Care to bet?
- A hundred francs.
- Twenty dourous.
You're too ambitious.
Not ambitious, just patient.
L can wait.
- L tend to stand people up.
- L know how to wait in one place.
One day you'll forget and walk into my sights.
Our friend slimane is funny.
He means it.
He wants to arrest me.
Delusions of grandeur!
- L'll get you. It's written.
Sure, sure, sure.
- You're funny.
- And how much time will l do?
Consult a fortune-teller.
- And if l kill you?
- Insh'allah!
You despise me too much to kill me.
- You have a good mug.
- Do i?
You wear your badge on your face.
To look this phony, now that's honesty!
- Your compliments touch me.
- You deserve them.
L must be going.
Business calls.
Let's go.
Luck be with you, pépé.
What an amazing fellow!
Isn't he?
L think it's over.
L'll take you back.
With pleasure.
L lost my friends.
They must have gone home.
Isn't pépé le moko amusing?
He's entertaining.
But you won't arrest him.
L've written the date of his arrest on the wall of my room where the sun shines.
Not bad for a fiasco!
No police operation was better named.
For a cleanup, it was a wipeout.
Spare us your jokes.
It's not a joke, it's an image.
Forget about arresting pépé in the casbah.
Not even this "grandpa" fellow who greets us with a hail of lead?
We arrested him twice.
He had alibis.
We all but apologized to him.
- Ever search his place?
- Four times.
- And?
- Four times nothing.
He's god up there.
You don't arrest god.
In paris, we're not so easily discouraged.
But you have means.
Exactly.
Your best means is the information you get from us informers.
The only way to arrest pépé is to get him into town.
But he knows the score.
He's no dumber than you are.
What we need is bait.
And bait l have: Pierrot.
Pépé loves pierrot like a brother, a brother who could be his son.
You get my meaning?
Not really.
L get pierrot to come into town.
You collar him.
You keep it under your hat.
Mystery and discretion are your trump cards.
Pépé starts to worry.
What does he do?
He comes looking for him, like a worried mother.
He falls into your snare like a confused rabbit.
Child's play!
What do you say?
Why not?
How about you gentlemen?
It remains to be seen.
Why not call in the army to clean up the casbah?
Algeria was already taken by marshal bugeaud.
- Are we agreed?
- Agreed.
- And the reward?
- Agreed, too.
But can we trust you?
No double-dealing?
L'm an informer, not a hypocrite.
How will you get pierrot down?
L have a brilliant plan.
Pierrot has a mother, whom he loves.
He's a bad boy, but a good son.
We don't arrest the son, but the bad boy.
- How?
The great thing about my plan is that it has to stay a secret.
Is the "ayrab" here?
L need paper.
Tonight, you can add pierrot's name to your list of arrests.
- What's so funny?
- L'm not laughing.
L'm watching you sell out your friends retail.
You're a born trader, régis.
You deliver door to door.
That supposed to be an insult?
What are you looking at, pépé?
Nothing.
The sea. The boats.
Doesn't it make you seasick?
Doesn't it give you a headache asking stupid questions?
You have a headache?
No, a ship-ache!
Don't shout.
L'm not. L'm thinking.
- About what?
- About stuff.
You shouldn't think about stuff.
You're not used to it.
That's why you have a headache.
- When will l get out of this place?
- You starting again?
L'm like england.
My future is on the waves.
Do l bore you?
No, inès, algiers bores me.
- L'd go with you.
- That's impossible.
If you came with me, you'd be a sort of portable casbah.
Two years of the casbah, two years of you.
It's getting to be a round figure.
Put yourself in my place:
Inès morning, noon and night.
You're no woman, you're a diet!
- You didn't used to say that.
- L was being polite.
- You, polite?
- Yes, polite.
L've been fed up for six months.
But l kept my mouth shut for you.
So show some tact.
With or without tact, you can never escape the casbah.
They want to arrest you.
But you're already under arrest.
Just try to get out.
One step out, and it's "good-bye, pépé!"
Thank heavens for the police!
- Will you shut up!
- Forget about paris!
No more paris, no more marseille.
Nothing but the casbah!
Shut up, l tell you!
Are you finished?
- No, l love you!
And l'm not finished!
- L'll shut rou up!
Hello, tania.
Carlos doesn't talk like that.
No, he never talks. He acts.
- He beats you?
- Yes, it relaxes him.
And since you're a woman, you take it without complaining.
L've always been beaten.
When l did the music halls, my crooner boyfriend used to slap me around because l was more popular.
L got a face men like to clout.
L've tried changing it.
L've been a redhead, a brunette, a blonde, but nothing doing.
L can't dye my hair green!
- They've calmed down.
- Pépé? He wouldn't hurt a fly.
You don't say!
Did you hear all that?
Hello, old girl.
Women will be your undoing, pépé.
Relax. L give them my body but l keep my head.
Who knows when l might need it, right?
But when they say "l love you," they don't practice discretion.
What do you expect?
It's my sex appeal.
Going down?
- Get home all right?
- No problem.
Meet any shady types?
- Who?
- You.
L was very cuddly with you.
And your girlfriend?
L took her back to her hotel.
What'd she say?
Nothing much.
She just talked.
L don't really listen to women.
What did you think of her?
Not bad.
She's got pearls... and the kind of smile l like:
With lip rouge!
And bracelets like l understand them:
In platinum with small diamonds.
And a "to-hell-with-you" attitude.
What'd she say?
- You charm them all to pieces.
Sure, but this one's a little queen.
Did she mention me?
She got to you.
She's as different from inès as a phonograph from a wireless.
What did she say?
- She asked lots of questions.
- And what did you answer?
- Nothing.
L kept thinking l hadn't answered that question you'd asked me.
Oh, sure!
So, what do l get if you arrest me?
Twenty years, with a good lawyer.
You love me too much for that.
Don't make me turn you into a stiff.
You have such nice curls.
What's her name?
- Who?
The sister last night.
You must really like her, pépé.
Just a passing fancy.
Let's go to chani's.
L have a mother, too, pierrot.
So as a son l'm telling you:
Have confidence.
But l sent her the money order.
Why doesn't she come?
What did she write?
That she was waiting to get over a cold.
We're not in normandy.
She still has to cross france.
- She's 72.
- So what?
My mother died at 82 in an accident, coming home from a dance.
Stop yakkin' and come play cards!
Grandpa wants to win the trick.
Right, grandpa?
- Win the trick at belote?
This game is beneath one's honor.
Quit making a fuss.
Belote is just the poor man's bridge.
L never use the vernacular except when l'm with one of those "gentlemen" who think french is a dead language.
C'mon, pierrot.
Mister chic and me are waiting.
Hello, yaslema pépé.
- Is pierrot around?
- He's down at chani's.
Pierrot's new girl is cute.
His new girl is albert's old girl.
L arrested him during the last ramadan.
Praise be to god, he went down for 20 years, as well.
Why "as well"?
No reason.
- L have a letter for him.
- L'll give it to him.
- L can't.
- Why not?
L was told to give it to pierrot.
L'm his woman.
It's the same thing.
- L never gave it to you.
- Say what you want.
More shenanigans!
The "shenani-gangster" isn't who you think.
- The what?
- Nothing. It's a neologism.
A neo... l got it.
You're lucky.
How's the game, grandpa?
Look at your friend carlos.
Doesn't he look like a losing card?
Count me in.
Carlos plays a brutal hand.
A tactical error.
Be careful how you play!
L'd have played the ace.
- L smell trouble.
- Or the queen, not the jack.
- Stop sneezing at my hand.
- You have no hand.
Thank you!
- And get off my back.
- Why?
- L have an itch.
- You're so nervous.
Consider yourself excluded.
Got it?
Go home!
Read this and wait outside.
Listen, pierrot.
Your pal régis... l don't like you two together.
- Why not?
Some clocks read
2 o'clock and chime 4 when it's only 11:45.
Régis doesn't ring true.
- You can't prove that.
- L'm telling you.
- He's straight with me.
- Maybe, but don't be pals.
Well, l like him.
There are two things, pépé.
For business, you're the boss.
Then there's the rest.
L don't need anyone for that.
You don't need anyone?
Lucky for you l like you.
Now run along.
He's just a kid.
Well?
It's strange.
Your mother arriving without letting you know.
Not even a cable.
Exactly!
Is she stingy?
It depends.
- Maybe she wanted to surprise you.
- But she wrote!
It's funny she would arrive here sick.
She's never traveled before.
Where's she staying?
At a friend's.
12 trough st.
You know it?
L do. L could take you there.
It's a safe neighborhood.
But tell me, are you sure it's her handwriting?
You have any other letters?
- Sure.
Put them side-by-side, like siamese twins.
We'll see if it's the same mother.
Let's go to the house.
Carlos, you lost your tricks for the fifth time.
Slimane is a delightful good-luck charm.
Cops bring me bad luck.
Go buzz somewhere else.
L don't like bluebottles.
Don't get excited, l'll move.
But it won't change your luck if it's bad.
Have a good game and bon appetit.
So long, slimane.
You're too brutal.
And you're not brutal enough.
L can't stomach slimane.
- Slimane's a regular guy.
Sure, regular.
Sure, he's a cop, but he understands things.
When pierrot deserted and came here, he looked the other way.
Slimane is welcome so long as l'm in the casbah.
You're too good.
Like with pierrot, you're too soft.
Kids are like broads: Kick their butts!
You're too sentimental.
- You pain me.
- Repeat that?
You pain me.
He says you pain him.
- L got it.
- Your play.
L have 50.
No mistake about it.
It's from my old lady.
Looks like it.
Same spelling mistakes. Same "m."
- What?
- Same "m."
Same simple way of crossing her "t's."
But this one looks a little shaky.
My old lady has a fever.
You have an answer to everything.
Her temperature must've been 104 here.
This isn't a letter, it's a thermometer.
Would you go if you were me?
Sure.
L can't leave her alone.
She knew you as a child.
Is this street far?
An hour, round-trip.
Let's go. L'll never forget you doing this for me.
You're a pal.
- L'm good-natured.
A nice little lunch, mr. Slimane?
A nice little lunch, mr. Slimane?
Why not?
L feel an appetite coming on for good things.
Ajackal's appetite!
We don't often serve mr. Slimane.
Gluttony doesn't usually mix with my usual occupations.
Be it as god wills.
Who are those four people there?
Mr. Kleep, of kleep champagnes, his lady friend, his associate and lady friend.
L see. Seat me next to them.
The pleasure of their company will add to the menu.
Sulking, maxime dear?
It's the heat. And my head.
And my stomach. L feel nauseous.
- Is that all?
Algeria doesn't agree with you.
He's too old.
L never felt better in my life.
You enjoy contradicting me.
You don't love me.
Come on, old man.
Who asked you?
She doesn't love me. It's a fact.
L adore you, so calm down!
Wipe your face.
You're handsome. Smile.
You're all sweaty.
Your skin sticks like taffy.
Inspector!
Come have something with us.
A cocktail.
Mr. Kleep, miss berthier, mr. Gravère... inspector slimane.
Have a seat.
What will you have?
- Thank you. L don't drink.
Where was l last night, during the shooting?
With me.
- You see? And who did l meet?
- Pépé le moko.
What connections!
Business connections.
You don't choose them.
The cutthroat they're talking about?
The gangster, yes.
- You saw him again?
- This morning.
Did he mention me?
- To be frank...
- he liked my pearls.
He can still admire the woman.
Pépé's a fellow with taste.
- What's he like?
- Charming... and frightening.
- L want to see him!
- L want to know what he thinks, how he ended up in the casbah.
It must be thrilling!
That can be arranged, provided you have a guide.
For a lady without an escort, the casbah... whenever you like.
L'm at your service.
- As soon as you can.
- Tonight, then?
Once was enough for me.
L hate the lice and the stench!
We'll go with gravère, all right?
L love adventure!
L'll spray myself with pesticide.
So, inspector, this evening, if you like...
- where's pierrot?
- How should l know?
Weren't you with him?
On the way down, but not coming back.
Hasn't he come back?
What did he tell you?
He just said "see you later."
He didn't say when.
You've got a face to scare someone off his feet.
Go check at grandpa's.
Here's the bank.
The main entrance.
The staff entrance. Follow me?
- L follow you. Go on.
Tomorrow at 2 p.m.
The cashier brings the money here.
This is all from a sure source.
Here's the cash desk, the strong room.
The safe is here.
Grandpa, you're outside.
You fade into the background.
Into the background!
Not so easy!
L'll wear my brown suit, pearl-gray tie and suede vest.
- Who is it?
- Is that you, pierrot?
It's aresha.
Grandpa, it's my pierrot.
L've looked all over.
- You tried chani's?
- Yes.
L've looked everywhere.
L can't find him anywhere.
He should've been back by now.
- Back?
Where from?
- 12 trough st.
- He went down into town?
- Yes, to see his mother.
- To see his mother?
- She's sick.
- What's this nonsense?
- Someone brought him a letter.
- Who did?
- The "ayrab."
So pierrot went right down with régis.
Then régis came back.
Now l'm waiting for pierrot.
That's all.
- And where's régis?
- At the algerian's.
No need to spell it out.
Let's go!
See you later.
- Stick around.
- L'm in a hurry.
Let's wait for pierrot.
You'll leave when he gets back.
- Look, pépé...
- no "look." c'mon.
- You afraid of something?
- Why should l be afraid?
Yes, why?
But usually you never even say hello to me, so l'm a bit disconcerted.
L underestimated you.
L was wrong. Come on.
- Where?
- In here.
L hear you're a brave man.
Surprised?
And you proved it.
You can be naturally brave without knowing it.
Like when you took pierrot down to trough st. That was nice.
You heard about that?
Naturally.
In here.
You're a good guy, régis.
A real man.
- L'm just a friend.
- Sure you are.
Tell me, when did you leave pierrot?
Right away.
On trough street?
He went to see his old mother.
- So she's in algiers?
- L don't know.
But he went to see her.
It seems he got a letter from her.
But you read this letter?
So there's no "it seems"?
Then you two left together.
Then you came back alone.
- That's normal.
What could be more normal?
- Need me?
- No, we're just chatting. Sit down.
Régis and pierrot went down to trough st.
Fine. So you're waiting for poor pierrot.
Why "poor pierrot"?
- Because he went with régis.
- So what?
You're right, pépé.
L should say: You're waiting for pierrot with poor régis.
- You feeling hot?
- L can't breathe!
Buck up, old man.
Sure, you're worried about pierrot.
Have a drink.
Don't break the glass.
What's the matter with me?
You'll feel better in an hour.
Let me go, pépé!
You can't just leave.
With a fever like that?
Cigarette?
Don't make such a fuss.
Smoke it.
His hair's a bit long in the back.
Should l cut it?
You were fond of pierrot.
L still am.
Then you can't go until he gets back.
You want to know.
- You're hot. L feel bad.
- He's burning. Burned, even.
Let me go!
L have nothing to do with his absence!
Let me go! Please!
You know me.
L'm a regular fellow!
Let me out, pépé!
Let me out of here!
He's raving.
Poor guy!
He should stay in bed.
Don't do anything foolish.
Watch out for chills, my good man.
What's going on?
We're giving mr. Régis some last aid.
Is he sick?
He's feeling indisposed.
A slight blackout.
Come along, my good man.
Inès, go get pierrot at 12 trough st.
Bring him back here, if you can.
The sooner you do, the sooner régis feels better.
Move it!
12 trough st.
- A game of cards?
- If you want.
Cut, régis.
Spades, the death card!
Not good.
Where's pépé?
My friends want to meet him.
The brunette.
The one with the diamonds.
Yesterday, by chance... no, there is no chance... she saw him and then ran into him again.
But why bother explaining?
You know you make all women jealous.
- Why tell me this?
- Because l respect you.
So tell me, my sweet, where's pépé?
L don't know.
Have a nice walk, child.
If you'll come this way... trumps.
Play your heart.
You asked for it.
Sorry, l'm not feeling myself.
Where are you, then?
Stay with us.
He's thinking of pierrot.
The undertaker!
The one-eye!
If our friend and collaborator doesn't come back soon, l'll be very anxious.
- It won't be funny.
- No, it'd be awful.
But he'll be back, l tell you.
L'm sure of it, régis old pal.
What? L'll be right out.
Play without me.
L'll be right back.
You boys look after régis.
Never abandon a friend in need.
You still here?
A glass of anisette?
L love this place!
Oh, delectable!
A vision out of the arabian nights!
A night to spend a day with.
L love to travel.
L always imagine l'm somewhere else.
In corsica, l felt like l was in turkey.
Here, l'm in china!
A phonograph!
Let's have some music.
"Cheka tema..." it must be native music.
That should be funny!
So what do you think of the strange animal?
Strange, but not such an animal.
How do you like my burg?
L don't like the provinces.
Once past the paris city limits, l feel ill at ease.
Really?
If l can't wake up to paris, l want to go back to sleep.
You know paris?
It was my last burg... rue saint-martin.
The champs-elysées.
Gare du nord.
The opera. The boulevards.
Barbès. La chapelle.
- Rue montmartre.
- Blvd. Rochechouart.
Rue fontaine.
Place blanche!
Small world, isn't it?
Got a rif?
You understand?
We're neighbors.
Do your eyes hurt?
Your gems.
Not afraid they'll get swiped?
- Not with you.
- Right you are.
Excuse me.
- Régis?
- He's on his last hand.
Congrats! The kid's hardware must be worth a mint.
- So?
- Don't fall asleep.
- Cut it out.
- Need a hand?
- Cut it out, l said!
- What?
L'm old enough to know what to do.
So if you don't like it... l got it.
This should be more fun.
- What's his problem?
- Nothing. He's complicated.
This is fine stuff!
And they don't weigh much. Look!
What's it all worth?
Two grand?
- Add a zero.
- My selling price!
Put them back on.
- You put them back on.
Shall we dance?
- What's your name?
- Gisèle. Gaby for short.
- You a widow?
- Why?
- Who are you with?
- A gentleman.
- What's he like?
- Jealous.
- You in a hotel?
- Yes, the aletti.
- What's so funny?
- Nothing.
- A pity.
- A pity?
- A pity l don't know you better.
- Why?
So l could smack you one.
L hate people laughing without me knowing why.
This reminds me of bastille day, when l was a kid, in the gobelins.
- You from the gobelins?
- Can't you tell?
L went to school on rue de l'arbalète.
Just around the corner!
Imagine that!
Let's take a walk.
Where?
On the terrace.
There's a view of the port.
Not tonight. L'm not alone.
- When, then?
- Later.
- When?
- Tomorrow.
- You'll be gone by then.
- L'll come back.
- Promise?
- Promise.
- You want that, kid?
- Have some respect.
- What for?
- Because you don't usually.
- Where's pierrot?
- L don't know.
- Didn't you go?
- L couldn't leave you alone.
L'm with the lady.
- Where is he?
- Who?
- Régis.
- Come with me.
- So he squealed on you?
- You were right. Forgive me.
Where is he?
- L saved him for you.
- Where are they?
- Gone. They were scared.
The boy came of good stock.
Of course, he sort of deserted.
He hated the army.
Personally, l admire the uniform.
They're putting him in cold storage now.
He's cashed in his chips.
You'll get sick if you drink like that.
L was fond of pierrot.
- Are you done?
- Can't we even talk?
- Well?
- Well, it's over.
No more pierrot.
L was alone at the cemetery.
L did as the gypsies do.
A handful of dirt over his body.
Pierrot can sleep in peace now.
You have a heavy heart.
You couldn't even escort him to his final resting place.
L'm your friend.
L feel for you.
But don't worry.
One day, your enemies won't stop you from leaving the casbah.
What do you mean?
You'll go like pierrot. Feet first.
If you're patient, you'll have the last word then.
L'll go when l want. And alive.
Don't get upset.
L know you. You're not crazy.
What's all this?
That's enough!
Enough of that racket!
- You saw her again?
- Who?
Gaby, the woman the other night.
- Wasn't she a beauty? A pity.
- Why a pity?
A pity she won't be back.
She's a lady who dislikes disturbances.
You feel hurt.
- What?
Why should l care?
So you say.
Enough out of you!
Get on home!
Go on!
Get out, all of you!
You, too!
L don't want to see anybody.
But she said she'd come again.
A pity.
Pierrot is dead and the woman you desired... there are such days.
She ain't coming back and that suits you fine.
Her rocks.
Woulda been a snap!
Get off my back!
Guys with all flash and no fire burn me up!
No moonlight serenades for me!
- Get the hell out!
No need to insist.
L got it.
Your friends lack tact.
They don't respect the appeal of your sorrow.
Shakespearean style is out of fashion nowadays.
L can see how they disgust you.
Get off my back!
L'll go into town when l like!
L'm a free man, you hear!
And l've had enough of all your yapping!
L'll go when l feel like it.
Right now, even!
L'm going down now!
She can't come up, but l can go down.
And no one will stop me, you hear?
What's the matter?
He's mad!
He's going into the city.
He won't listen to reason.
It's slimane.
Le moko's coming out.
Post men at new gate st.
Casbah st. And ramdam st.
He's drunk. We've got him.
Quick!
Pépé, you're crazy.
Don't go!
Don't go! L'm not jealous!
She's up there!
She's at the house.
She's waiting for you. Up there.
Where is she?
Where is she?
So you were pulling my leg?
A cock-and-bull story?
Answer me.
Answer me!
It was the only way to stop you.
You do this to me?
Begging for myself wouldn't stop you.
So... you're right.
L'm an idiot.
L'm sorry.
Aren't you fed up with a guy like me?
L'm rotten.
You are what you are.
A good kid like you should have it easy.
It's not fair.
But here we are, the two of us.
You run so fast.
L really stepped on it.
But l caught up with you.
You're a real champ!
L'm thirsty.
It's just like me.
Nothing in its gut.
L'm going for a drink.
L kept my promise.
Here l am.
You look strange!
We didn't say good-bye the other night, so l came to say hello.
C'mon!
Is she there?
She's a walking ice palace.
The sparklers she's got on her!
- Looking for pépé?
- No, why?
- He's busy.
- L'm not looking for him.
In case you were, l just ran into him.
- L didn't ask you.
- He's with the girl with the diamonds.
- Will you come again?
- Tomorrow.
- You sure?
- Same time.
Here?
L really like you.
You're beautiful.
And being with you is like being in paris.
With you l escape, you see?
You're a different landscape.
L was pretending to sleep earlier.
L let my mind wander.
You know what l heard?
The métro.
Can you imagine? The métro!
You taunt me with diamonds, you're wearing silk and gold, but you remind me of the métro and frites and café au lait on café terraces.
That's what you're like.
What did you do before?
Before what?
Before the diamonds.
L dreamed of them.
L have to go.
- If you don't come...
- what will you do?
You really can't get rid of this casbah?
Why do you ask?
No, they've got me boxed in.
L can't hole up anywhere else.
They're hunting me.
If l leave here, they nail me.
Happy now?
You're reassured.
L'm neither happy nor reassured.
You're right, because l could do anything, even come looking for you.
Until tomorrow, pépé.
L always keep my promises.
You smell so good.
It's the métro.
In first-class.
Take her to marengo st.
Did it go all right?
- Got the gems?
- What gems?
What gems? The lady's!
What were you doing together?
- Watercolors!
- Water-what?
L got it.
Oh, what a splendid dar
the sun shines along mr war
the sun shines along mr war is that pépé le moko?
He sounds so happy!
He must have come into money!
Love paints all a rosr shade
it's the one thing that doesn't fade
you can sar what rou mar
it's sad when it goes awar
all rou need for a life ofbliss
is a sweet miss something's up.
Love paints all a rosr shade
it's the one thing that doesn't fade
you can sar what rou mar
it's sad when it goes awar what's got into you?
L've got a rendezvous today on place blanche!
You've gone mad!
L'm mad, and it's a great feeling!
We have to have fun today!
Today's sunday!
- It's thursday.
- L tell you it's sunday!
Hello, carlos.
How are things?
Shopping with your dame?
He still treats you with kindness?
He's not the kind to sing.
It's business first.
- What's that?
- Go easy!
L got it.
- You're happy.
- To see you.
- Have you seen gaby again?
- You're nosy!
- She came again?
- Such lovely curls!
- Did she come again?
- You must sweep 'em off their feet.
Did she come?
Will she come?
What mascara do you use?
You naughty thing!
Did she make a date?
So long, inspector darling.
And keep what l said under your hat!
Well?
This is going to be difficult, but l have to do it.
Your friend miss gaby is overly fond of local color.
She spends her time in the casbah.
What's all this about?
The casbah is a place where caution must be taken.
An unaccompanied woman is an object of desire.
So l can't insist enough that you keep an eye on your friend and advise her to... it would be a pity if there was an accident.
L didn't notice anything.
Of course not.
But let me make this clear.
Miss gaby must not return to the casbah.
Thank you.
You needn't worry.
L got it.
You can come at 5:00.
Make sure everything looks right.
L want cushions and ashtrays, and vases with flowers.
No problem.
And water the flowers with eau de cologne.
L'll use my "rêve dejava"!
It smells like violets!
And put out a table with two settings.
L'll handle the grub and the juice.
All this for his new bird!
- She's no bird!
- Why? Birds are nice.
Sure, my turtledove!
Five o'clock sharp.
Going out?
- To do what?
- To take a walk.
- Where?
- Bois de vincennes.
L want a serious answer!
Then stop asking stupid questions.
L don't know anyone here.
L just walk straight ahead.
And where do you end up?
- L'll find out.
- You're staying here!
Oh, no! Your hotel's as dreary as a funeral parlor.
Whenever l come back here, it's like walking into a family vault.
Good-bye, darling.
L know where you're going.
So show me the way.
To the casbah, as usual.
As usual?
To meet pépé le moko.
So you're spying on me now?
- You're with me, you stay with me.
- What for?
L won't have you behave like a...
- a what?
- Like a... exactly!
That's what l am to you.
Shut up!
L say what everyone knows.
Look at yourself, then look at me.
- You stay!
- Don't waste your time!
If you go, don't bother coming back.
My mind's made up.
Here! You can have your investment back.
- Stay here!
- Have my mail forwarded.
L must be crazy!
- No need going to the casbah.
- Why not?
Inspector meunier acted in self-defense.
- So?
- So he fired.
There's no more pépé le moko. Alas.
L knew she'd stand him up.
- He's got feelings.
- Well, l'm going down into town and personally take care of the lady's sparklers.
Which boat?
Citr of oran?
At 10 a.m.
Prepare my bill and make reservations... are you coming?
Not staying for the funeral?
Four first-class cabins.
Have two whiskies sent up.
Will you have a little whiskey?
Just what a widow needs.
You look dead.
Somebody turn off the juice?
- L've had it with the casbah.
- You too? It weighs on me, too.
L know how you feel, pépé.
We don't always see eye-to-eye on business.
But we agree on principles.
- What do you mean?
L'm going into town to see what's what.
We gotta find a dodge to get outta here.
Be a good guy.
Give me some tips.
- When are you going?
- Now. Why wait?
- L'll fill you in on something.
- Sure, l'll case the joint.
Since you're going down, do me a favor.
Let's hear it.
Deliver a letter for me.
Can l count on you?
So long as it's not too heavy.
It's for your society lady.
Don't blush.
Just give me your note.
Bring me a pen and some paper.
So you wait for an answer.
L'll be back in two hours.
L'll be with tania at ma tarte's.
L'd rather not be at inès's.
She'd only ask questions.
At ma tarte's in 2 hours.
Tell tania.
- What time is it?
- Nine o'clock. It's light out.
- L slept that long?
- And snored even longer!
- Where's carlos?
- He's not back.
L waited up all night.
He won't come now.
Sure he will. He's not a kid.
L hope he does.
L'm gonna give him a piece of my mind for being late.
Poor carlos.
There are days l could kill myself.
Bite your tongue! Do like me.
When l feel down, l change eras.
Change eras?
L think of my youth.
L look at my old photo and imagine it's a mirror.
L put on one of my old records, from the days when l'd sell out the paris music halls.
L'd go on stage against a country backdrop with a red spotlight on my pale face, and l'd sing...
some people dream of america
as ther see it at the cinema
a magnificent land ther swear
our paris just can't compare
that kind of talk makes them bold
when ther feel blue
and want to holler
but therjust end up
hungry and old
in new york
scrounging for a dollar
among the criminals and outcasts
and emigrants with broken pasts
ther sing of paris at last
where's mr windmill
on place blanche
mr tobacco shop, mr corner café
when every dar was a new chance
where are all the friends
who made mr dar
where are the dance halls
where we'd meet
the songs the accordionist
would plar
where are the places
where we could eat
without a cent
in our pockets to par
where are ther now
- is pépé here?
- What is it?
- L couldn't find you.
- Who let him in?
L must speak to you. Alone.
There are no false witnesses here.
We're silent as the grave.
No one will talk.
- L'm rotten.
- L know.
- Worse than that.
- Not likely.
Insult me. L deserve it.
You got delusions of grandeur?
It's about that letter from pierrot's mother.
L took it to ayesha, not knowing it was police bait.
Had l known, l'd never have taken it to ayesha!
A woman gave it to me.
L didn't suspect a thing.
L'm an informer, but l have limits.
You're only a half-weasel.
- That's why l came.
- For what?
L couldn't take it anymore.
It was weighing on me.
Forgive me, pépé.
- Don't run yourself down.
L want your respect.
L want to win it back.
So l'll come clean: Carlos is done for.
- What?
- What's this?
- It's the truth.
- You squealed?
- L wouldn't be here.
Carlos, pierrot... it's your turn next.
Stop it!
They arrested him? Who did?
Inspector meunier and his men.
They cornered him.
- Did they shoot?
- No, it was a clean arrest.
Clean! A dirty trick!
L was there when they brought him in.
L got near him. He slipped me the letter you gave him.
"Take it to the aletti hotel.
It's for a woman."
So l took it, like he said.
Always playing the mailman!
- Shut up!
- So you write to women?
And he says it in front of me!
- Don't like it? Get out.
You never wrote me a romantic letter!
So you saw the lady?
So give! The reply.
She couldn't write.
She's being watched.
But she's waiting for you.
Her hotel window overlooks the port.
She's on the lookout.
She'll let you in.
Go through the casino.
- Is that all?
She said she couldn't get away.
- You're not going?
- Get off my back!
She's waiting.
What message do l give her?
Waiting, is she?
L'll take the reply myself.
You wait here.
They'll keep you company.
L'm expected.
Then l'll wait.
- Carlos say anything else?
- Nothing.
Did they search him?
So they swiped the 5,000 francs?
He didn't slip them to you?
- You sure?
- On my honor!
Come off it!
Louvain took them.
He put them in his desk.
So gaby couldn't write since she's being watched?
By her friend.
- But she can see me later?
- Sure, on the docks behind the hotel.
Funny, isn't it?
Her friend won't be there.
- But why can't she write?
- Her friend was there.
Then how could she talk to you?
- Because...
- because what?
Your story doesn't hold together.
How could they have taken
5,000 off carlos when he hadn't a cent on him?
But l saw 5,000.
And do you think carlos would give you my letter?
You wrote one, didn't you?
You think l'd believe carlos could be that stupid?
- L give you my word.
- Keep it!
So you wanted to deliver my reply.
So her friend will be out?
For a woman being watched, she's a bit free.
The joke's over, ayrab!
Now you come clean!
Spill the beans!
- There's nothing else to say!
- Yes, there is!
- You're choking me!
- Just a clinch!
- L told you the truth!
- Find another truth!
- It's the truth!
- Shut up!
L swear!
On my father's head!
No risk! He was guillotined!
Let's start over.
Move and you're a dead man!
Carlos was arrested.
That's true.
L told you he was.
- And you read my letter.
- L told you l did.
So far, so good.
But the rest bothers me.
What happened next?
- Nothing!
Something did!
You've got a thick skull!
We'll see just how thick!
You'll hurt him!
Spit it out!
Do l have to kill you?
L'll refresh your memory!
It was all slimane's doing.
He told me to come here.
To tell you what l told you.
He thinks you'll come down.
He has the hotel surrounded.
That's all.
So you didn't see her?
Why didn't she come last night?
Slimane told her you'd been killed.
She sails at 10:00 on the citr of oran.
That all?
Thanks, then.
Go get max and jimmy.
You stay put!
Stay where you are.
You'll have to console inès.
With carlos and me gone, that makes two widows.
- You're not going!
- What?
Think l'll let her leave without me?
So long, old girl.
- Not waiting for inès?
- Tell her l got away.
You're a woman, you know what to say.
L'm going by the house.
So long.
You can't leave like this, pépé!
What did l do wrong?
You're a good kid.
Don't be angry.
Blame it on the casbah.
Let me go.
Let me go!
It's not you l was expecting.
- He won't come.
- What are you saying?
- Pépé's leaving.
- Leaving? What do you mean?
He's at the harbor, waiting to board ship.
We'll see about that.
How wretched you must be!
- Go on!
- Let him leave!
Five minutes!
The nice thing about traveling
is going home.
That way you can leave again.
L've had a good time.
Even if l've always found the sun dreary.
How about you, maxime?
L've never laughed so much.
You see, pépé, you showed up for our rendezvous.
L knew l could count on you.
- Not here, slimane.
- As you like. L can't refuse you anything.
Be a sport.
L just want one last thing.
L can't escape.
Let me watch the boat sail.
L promise l'll stay right here.
L know l can trust you.
Forgive me.
New Mexico
And that's why I tell you to stay out of New Mexico.
And there ain't no law but this.
Show him in. and his help would be invaluable to us.
I hoped you'd say that, Steele.
Certainly.
So they're sending another deputy, eh.
Boys, here's to the big herd.
Hyah, hyah, hyah, hyah
There's a man following us.
He ain't a-followin' us now.

You had a pretty hard trip, didn't you?
Yeah.

Aha. and I wouldn't be caught nappin'.
Well, that's mig hty fine of you, Mr. Steele.
Everything's just fine.

We'll catch him.
Boy, I'm sure hungry.
Shh!
Afraid you'd be late for breakfast.
Stand up.
Who the devil are you? and I figured you in on the deal. and I'm counting on your help.
Get back against that wall
I'm arrestin' Arizona for the murder of Cal Brett.
Set'em up here, bartender.
Here comes the deputy now.

Aw, come on, let's have another drink here.
What's that?
Hey, hey.
Hm.

It's 9:00.
I'll show you.
Stick'em up, Arizona.

All right, get going.
Get a move on. you'll never get out of here alive with Arizona.
Just a minute.

In the name of the law
Now, get in that cell.
Let's get out of this rat's nest here.

Keep it up, boys.
They're retreating.
Mr. Crew ain't fooling meany. get the boss.
Hey, come on, boy. Come on
Yee-hoo!
Give it to'em, Bossy boy.
Hurry up, boys.
I hope he ain't hurt?
Where's Arizona?
I'll be meetin' up with him before long.
Get on that horse.
There you are.
That's fine,sir. Hmm.
Say, pardner,
I wanna talk to you.
Let me go!
Sonora! for spoiling the big romance.
Let's see.
Where were you
Right where I never should have been interrupted.
Hey, John!
Pardon me.
Thank you.
I wonder if we'll get a good price
Round up every gunman in the valley.
Well, major, good to hear this talk.
See you all at the fort, I hope.
They wake me up in the middle of the night...
I'll see he don't get away.
Once more, boys. Let's go.
Come on, let's go.
Whoa. Whoa.
Vamos!
Giddyap, buddy.
Where's Ginger?
Giddyap, Mike, giddyap.
Are you all right?
Hello, darling.
Bring'em up the hill.
Get those buzzards!
They're turning the herd.
Come on.
Madre de dios.
Put them in the mill.
Turn the herd.
Hoo-ha!
They're coming around, boys.
They got them in the mill.
They saved'em.
Aww, that's too far.
Giddyap.
Heave the starboard line!
Heave a port line!
Make fast the starboard line!
- Hello, amigo!
- Hiya, Moreno.
Looks like more passengers this trip.
Keep your fingers crossed.
We may have some luck.
- What did you say?
- The boat sails at four.
Hi, Rafel.
- Here you are. Two sacks this time.
- How is the talent this trip?
- Oh, very bad, señor.
- Not much to choose from?
Have my share. Is this all you've got?
There is not one you would give that for.
Wait a minute. Les, look at that.
- Pretty mouse.
- Who hung that one on you?
No, señor. We have had some very bad weather.
I fall against a doorknob.
You ought to cut its fingernails.
- The boat leaves at 4 a.m., miss.
- I'll be here.
Boo!
- I thought you said...
- You chump, that's the doorknob.
- Come on, we got some work to do.
- So long, Rafel.
Be careful, boys, be careful.
Wait a minute.
- Now there's a strong character.
- Probably the wrong approach.
- We'll try again.
- Easy does it.
- Lady, we want to appeal to your...
- What?
It wasn't me. He thought it up.
We were just gonna buy you a drink.
Are you Americans?
I thought you were a couple of...
Gee, why didn't you say so?
Buy me a drink? I'm gonna buy you one.
- Then you won't need this.
- Well, come on.
Sounds good to hear something other than pig Latin. Where are you from?
He's Les Peters and I'm Joe Souther,
New York and Kansas.
- What's your name?
- Lee.
- Lee what?
- Bonnie Lee, from Brooklyn.
Oh, look out.
- What was that?
- Fifth Avenue bus line.
Too bad you didn't break your neck.
Who saw her first?
Here you are, Dutchy.
Dutchy, meet Miss Lee.
This imposing gentleman is the postmaster and banker of Barranca.
- I've always wanted to know...
- Also the owner of this general store, proprietor of the bar on your left and chief cook and bottle-washer of this luxurious hotel and restaurant you see before you.
- That hardly seems enough, Mr ..
- John Van Ruyter is the name.
- Don't pay any attention...
- How about a drink?
Sure. Sit down, make yourself at home.
What are you having?
- How's the local Scotch?
- I carry only the best.
- Make mine bourbon, Dutchy.
- Me, too.
- Well, me too.
- My Scotch is good. I drink it myself.
- Why don't you have one with us?
- I will.
Does it seem good to be off that boat.
What are you looking at?
What's the matter?
Nothing.
Boy, you're sure easy on the eyes.
You heard me use that two weeks ago.
It still sounds good anyway.
What are you fellas doing here?
Same as everybody else, working for the Dutchman.
- What's that?
- We fly mail and things.
Flyers? I was wondering why you're carrying those guns around.
Did you think we're a couple of banana cowboys?
Who'd think there's a flying field.
Where is it?
- Right outside the door.
- Well, skol!
- To us.
- Down the hatch.
Happy landings.
What are you doing here?
On your way back to the States?
- If I don't get a job in Panama.
- Professional?
- I quit a show in Valparaiso. On me.
- Oh, don't do that.
I wanted to buy you a drink.
- No, I'm paying for these.
- But I...
- Let him pay. It's much better.
- Wait a minute, Dutchy.
If you take his money,
I'll never come here again.
- Joe, where are you going to eat?
- I'll starve, but I won't come in again.
- I better take his money.
- If you do, I'll never come here again.
- No, I'm gonna pay for this.
- He wants to...
- I meant what I said.
- So did I, Dutchy. Come on.
The drink's on the house. Satisfied?
- Very well satisfied.
- That's a shame. He's cute.
Dutchy, come back.
No more monkey business.
- Bring a bottle.
- You better take it easy.
- One of you has to fly the mail.
- I thought Tony was first out.
Tony has a touch of fever.
It's either you or Joe.
- Can you beat that?
- Fine thing.
- Dutchy, pick a number.
- A number? What for?
- Anything up to ten.
- One to ten, number...
Oh, no. No, not me. If you want to gamble on who flies in that weather, pick someone else for a number.
- Bonnie.
- Anything up to ten.
- Not me. I feel the same way he does.
- Nobody's worrying about who's flying.
We're worried about who's going to take you to dinner.
- Who said anything about dinner?
- We'll send you a formal invitation.
- All right, Les, odd or even?
- Odd.
Oh, that's too bad. Well, Bonnie, how do you like your steak?
Well, I don't know if I...
Do you mean real American steak?
I don't want to brag, but how do you think I keep those boys here?
- I guess I'm staying for dinner.
- That's the girl!
Why do I always say ''odd'' and it always comes out...
Oh, I hate that noise.
Joe Souther, Joe Souther, you're up next.
- That's you, Les.
- Joe Souther.
Sorry, kid.
Joe, stand by.
Tex says it's clearing.
Oh, no, not me, Poppa. Les lost.
I'm having dinner with Miss Lee.
- Miss Lee, Mr Carter.
- How do you do?
Hello, Miss Lee. Sorry, Joe, the mail goes out on schedule. So do the pilots.
Since when, Geoff?
I want Les to go down and check over what came today.
That's an all-night job.
- When'd you think that up?
- Just now.
Look here, Geoff, the boys gambled and he lost. Let him go.
- Is that an order?
- Yeah. No. I...
Who runs things here, anyway?
- That's what I mean. Joe...
- Miss Lee and I are having dinner.
Don't worry about Miss Lee.
I'll be glad to take over.
Now, look here,
I've got something to say about this.
- Chorus girl?
- No, I do a specialty.
Pick up that stuff on your way back from
Las Cruces. See you later, Miss Lee.
Oh, you will, will you?
Well, I might have...
Say, who does that guy think he is, anyway?
- The boss.
- As you may have gathered.
- He's not my boss. I'm not gonna let...
- I hope you win. I'll be seeing you.
- Goodbye, Joe.
- Now, Joe, be careful.
Dutchy, you ought to find something to worry about.
That's what you should be doing.
- Joe.
- Hi, Lily.
- No, no, Joe.
- I've got to go. I'll be back soon.
Bye, darling.
Well, how can he fly in this fog?
It's just on the ground. He'll pull through it. It's only 200 feet thick.
He's waiting for the heavy stuff piled up in the pass.
- Sounds like doubletalk.
- I guess it does.
The only way inland is through a deep pass. It's right up... You can't see it.
It's 14,000 feet at the low spot.
Wind and clouds make it a bad place.
We keep a lookout to tell us when it clears.
Calling Barranca. Calling Barranca.
- Here it comes in now.
- Go ahead, Tex.
She's moving fast.
How does it look down there?
- OK, if the wind doesn't shift.
- I'll take a look outside.
Big breaks now.
This looks like the last of it.
OK, she's open.
- Let 'em fly.
- OK, Tex.
Joe!
That's the most wonderful thing
I've ever seen.
Yes, reminded you of a great, beautiful bird, didn't it?
It didn't at all.
That's why it's so wonderful.
It's really a flying human being.
Yes, a bird would have too much sense to fly in that kind of muck.
Joe Souther, calling Joe Souther.
Go ahead, Geoff, go ahead.
- Radio check. One, two, three...
- Four, five, six...
...seven, eight.
Clear as a bell, Poppa.
On top at 400 between layers.
Say, Geoff, there's a heavy fog bank laying off the coast. Anything else?
No, that's all. All right, Joe.
- Hiya, Les.
- Hiya.
- Hey, Geoff.
- Hello, Kid.
The wind's swung round.
It's bringing that fog bank in.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- Calling Lookout. How much time?
- Move fast.
- Go ahead.
- How does it look up there?
- Better hold Joe for a while.
- He's gone. You should see him by now.
I can't see the tip of my nose. You can't tell what this stuff is gonna do.
- Stand by to put out a flare.
- Never mind the flare, Pop.
Little Jody heard every word.
What'll I do, come back?
Yeah. It's pretty thick down here.
When you get over the fog
I'll talk you in.
Say, Geoff, you tell that beautiful blonde I'm still in the running.
- Stick to business, Joe.
- I just wanna order two steaks.
- How about it, Dutchy?
- I heard you. Tell him it's all right.
- It's all right with me, too.
- All right, Joe, you're all set.
OK, here I come.
- Shorty, plug in that field set. Come on.
- Yes.
Shorty, get the big light ready.
Turn it straight up.
- Kind of cold out here.
- Pancho, light those tubs.
Joe Souther, Joe Souther.
OK, Geoff, coming down.
On top of the fog at 1500.
- Higher than I thought.
- We're turning on the lights.
- Turn them on.
- Here they go!
- There you are, Joe. See them?
- No, not a thing.
I can't even see the glow, Poppa.
- Must be thicker than it looks.
- Won't hurt to try.
- Hey, Baldy, shut off that piano.
- Yes, sir.
- Keep it quiet back there.
- Yes, sir.
Now look, Joe, pay attention.
It's all closed in down here.
You are west of the field, west of the field.
Fly due east. Fly due east.
Flying at 1500 due east.
Due east at 1500.
Hey, Joe, blip your motor.
Joe, you're passing over the field.
Go one mile.
Turn 180 degrees and start letting down.
Watch out for the lights.
Sounds a little that way.
Yeah. Joe, you're a little south, a little south.
OK, Poppa, turning north.
Hey, Kid, turn out that light, will you?
Keep it quiet back there!
Here I come.
Joe, you're coming in too high, you'll overshoot the field.
Make a turn, Joe.
Go further back and try it again.
OK, Geoff, I'm turning.
Can't you see the lights?
Nothing that even looks lik e a dim candle.
His line was OK.
Yeah. Joe, the direction was perfect.
Be sure to keep the same line.
All right, Geoff. I'm turning.
Here I come.
- Cut it up in hundreds, Joe.
- Take it easy, sonny.
- Geoff.
Gun her, Joe.
- I'm down to 100 now.
- That doesn't sound like...
Joe, pull up! You're heading for...
- Say, that wasn't right, was it?
- No, lady, not quite.
Look, Joe. You had the wrong line.
You're way off...
OK, Geoff. I saw the lights.
I'll get it next time.
Nothing doing.
Don't take any more chances.
- You've got three hours...
- Three hours?
She'll almost be on the boat by then.
I told you to stick to business.
Get up on top and cruise around until it opens up.
- Right, don't let him do it.
- Give me one more chance.
I think I see a hole.
Yeah, I do see one.
- I'm coming down.
- No, Joe, please don't!
You've got your orders. Do as I tell you.
Quit worrying about that blonde.
It's all right, Geoff. I see the lights.
I'll mak e it easy. I'll...
- There he is!
- Joe, pull her up!
Mike, get the wagon.
Take a pair of shears in case you have to cut him out. Les, get the mail.
Baldy, have the police clear the field.
- Hurry up.
- Yes.
Well, you did all you could.
Yeah.
Mr Wiseguy.
He may be alive, don't just stand there!
Haven't you caused enough trouble?
Calling Barranca, calling Barranca, calling Barranca.
- Calling Barranca, calling Barranca.
- Go ahead, Tex.
Geoff, did you get Joe down all right?
All except for one tree that stuck up too high.
Oh. Sorry.
Joe, you crazy fool.
Nobody could tell you anything.
You knew it all, huh? It serves you right.
I don't feel sorry for you, not a bit.
No skin off my nose.
If you can take it, I can.
- I'll take a look over there.
- OK, Kid.
Sparks, I forgot to tell Les, have the mail put in number seven.
Get it out and warm it up.
- Calling Lookout, calling Lookout.
- Go ahead, Geoff.
- Any change, Tex?
- No, just about the same.
We're all set to go down here.
OK, I'll let you know.
Now, wait a minute, Geoff.
- What?
- You are not going to...
Go ahead and say it.
When you got me into this flying business,
I was doing pretty good.
I made good money, I ate good,
I slept good nights.
In a week, you'll collect or lose your shirt.
Oh, I'm not thinking about that.
I can't go on killing nice kids like that.
Not if I lose a dozen shirts.
Think you're the only one feeling that way?
Then why do you send them up in that weather?
I'm running an airline. I'm not running it any different to anybody I ever flew for.
- Oh, Geoff...
- Now look, Dutchy...
...Joe died flying, didn't he?
And that was his job.
He just wasn't good enough.
That's why he got it.
I ain't built like you are, Geoff.
I shouldn't be in such a business.
We can't go on like that.
You got another pilot coming in on the next boat.
Oh, Geoff.
- You are a hard man, much too hard.
- Cut it out.
- I can't...
- Cut it out!
What's the use of feeling bad about something that couldn't be helped?
Give me a match, will you?
Joe just wasn't good enough.
He was bound to get it sooner or later.
Then you had no business to let him fly!
What, ground that kid?
I'd say he'd sooner be where he is than quit.
Here.
Dutch, Joe had a sister somewhere up in the States, didn't he?
- Yes.
- Well, I owed him 100 bucks.
- Here, send it to her.
- You don't owe him no money, Geoff.
- How do you know?
- Well, I...
He's got two months' pay coming.
Why should he loan from you?
If you've got so much dough to throw around, why not get that plane out of hock?
Take it easy, fella. We'll get along.
- Sam, how about that food?
- Coming right up.
- Make it snappy, we're hungry.
- Coming out.
- Kid, how is it out there?
- Everything's all right.
Yeah? Come on, let's get a drink.
Baldy, I'll take those.
- Hello, Pancho.
- Hello, Geoff.
Just a minute, Kid, I can use that.
- Gangway, Charlie.
- Hello, Geoff.
Mr Carter, Mr Carter.
Do you really think... I mean...
Do you really think it was my fault what happened?
Sure it was.
You were gonna have dinner with him.
The Dutchman hired him, I sent him up, the fog came in, a tree got in the way.
All your fault.
Forget it, unless you want the honour.
Hello, Lily.
- Mr Geoff!
- Throw this down, you'll feel better.
- Bottoms up. Salud.
- Salud.
It's pretty good. The best I've ever seen.
- Bonnie, look at this.
- Hi, Gent.
Oh, all right, Gent.
Meet Miss Lee, Gent Shelton.
- How do you do?
- Fine. How are you?
- Where you been?
- Checking those spare parts.
- Oh, I get it.
- Did I send you down there?
- Don't think up some other job for me.
- I hear I missed all the excitement.
- You won't see a better one.
- She's a good one.
- What'll you have to drink?
- You name it.
- Miss Lee?
- What did you say?
- Do you want a drink?
- No.
- You better have one.
- Make mine bourbon.
- Baldy, send over some drinks.
- Right.
Gangway, please, gangway.
Here's your steak.
Here's the other one. Who wants it?
- I'll take it over here.
- Yes, sir.
- Get me some coffee.
- You want coffee, miss?
- That looks all right.
- You got here for the fireworks.
How can you do that?
- What?
- Eat that steak.
- Well, what's the matter with it?
- It was his.
- You want me to have it stuffed?
- Don't you realise he's dead?
- Who's dead?
- Yeah, who's dead?
- Joe.
- Joe?
- Who's Joe?
- Anybody know a Joe?
What's wrong with you?
He was sitting here and now...
Let's break the news to Mother
And tell her there's no other...
- You...
- Well, how do you like that?
Wait, you little fool.
Why don't you use your...
- Stop it.
- How can you act like this when...
- I know, he's dead.
- Yes, he's dead.
He's been dead 20 minutes, and weeping and wailing won't make him any deader
20 years from now.
- How do you think we feel?
- I'm sorry.
Come on. Go outside and walk around.
Stay there until you put all that together.
Was that you they were razzing in there?
Well, don't feel too bad about it.
I did the same thing when I first come out here.
- Say, Mister, can you kick real hard?
- Maybe you won't need it.
I think I'd feel better.
All my life I've hated funerals.
The fuss never brings anybody back.
Just spoils remembering them as they really are.
When I see people actually facing it that way, I have to act like a sap.
You know, this flying business is new to me.
They need some crazy way of looking at it to go on.
- Does this sort of thing happen often?
- That depends on weather and luck.
We've drawn spades twice in three months, not counting this one.
- I guess they'll be at it again tomorrow.
- Tonight, if it clears.
They must love it. Flying, I mean.
- Why do you think they come here?
- It's like being in love with a buzz saw.
- Not much future in it.
- What is it that gets them?
I'm not a flyer myself.
You'd better ask the Kid.
- Miss Lee, Mr Dabb.
- How do you do?
- She wants to know why you like flying.
- I've been in it 22 years, Miss Lee.
I couldn't give you an answer that'd make sense.
- What's so funny?
- That's what my Dad used to say.
- Flyer?
- No, trapeze. He wouldn't use a net.
- Not much future in that, either.
- Yes.
We found that out.
Tell me about this head man Geoff.
Does he go up, too?
When he thinks it's too tough for anyone else.
Just shows you how wrong he can be.
The Kid could tell you.
He's Geoff's best friend.
The only thing I can tell you is he's a good guy for gals to stay away from.
Thank you, I'll remember that.
- What's it gonna be?
- How about Some Of These Days?
How does it go?
There's no B flat in there.
It goes...like that.
- What do you want?
- I came back for that drink.
- Grown up yet?
- Hope so.
- Good girl. Hey, Charlie!
- Yes, sir.
Go ahead.
That's awful! Look, can't you hear that?
I know. Will you go away, please?
We'll get it.
- You wanna hear how it really goes?
- Sure.
- Move over.
- You better be good.
Won't be as corny as you.
Take the pick-up with the horn.
Make it nice and slow.
The rest, watch for the breaks.
Ready now? Here we go.
I dig it!
- Hello, professional.
- That's part of my specialty.
- Yeah?
- Here's to you.
- You got a match?
- Yes, Geoff.
Thanks.
- Who's Joe?
- Never heard of him.
- Anyone know The Peanut Vendor?
- Yes, sir.
Give me those things, honey.
So long, Dutch.
- I'll take care of it.
- All right, Mike. Goodnight.
Here's all the stuff that was turned in.
I gave his clothes to the men on the field.
Yeah.
Well, he didn't have much to show for all...
- Take your pick, Sparks.
- I got a drawer full of that junk already.
I'm gonna get some sleep.
The Kid's sitting in for me.
Goodnight, Sparks.
See anything you'd like to have, Dutch?
I don't need anything to remember him by.
If you want a drink or so, help yourself.
- Goodbye, Miss Lee.
- Goodbye, Dutchy.
- Drop in again sometime.
- Thank you, I will.
Goodbye. It's too bad
Barranca is so far from Brooklyn.
It's only a few minutes past 12.
Your boat doesn't leave until 4 o'clock.
- Say when.
- When are you gonna get some sleep?
After your boat sails.
- Aren't you just wasting your time?
- That's a point that's open to argument.
That's what I'm afraid of, those arguments.
- What's the matter with them?
- They're too one-sided.
No hard feelings.
Your apology is accepted.
How about taking along a little souvenir?
Why not?
Help yourself.
You've got a good eye, lady.
Say, somebody must've given you an awful beating once.
Come on now, you better go home.
Goodnight.
- Hey, you're a queer duck.
- So are you.
I can't make you out.
Same here.
What was she like, anyway?
- Who?
- The girl that made you act like this.
A whole lot like you.
Just as nice, almost as smart.
- Chorus girl?
- Only by temperament.
- At least you're true to the type.
- Sit down, make yourself comfortable.
Still carrying a torch for her, aren't you?
- Got a match?
- Don't you ever have any?
Don't believe in laying in a supply of anything.
- Matches, money or women?
- That's right.
- No tomorrows, just today.
- That's right.
Is that why she gave you the air?
- Who?
- That girl.
Listen, I wouldn't ask any woman to...
Say, you can think up more questions. Here.
- What wouldn't you...
- What?
...ask anybody to do?
Did you ever know a woman that didn't wanna make plans?
Map out everything, get it all set?
Well, I don't blame them, I guess.
It's the only way they can run a home and have kids.
I suppose you think that's easier than flying.
- I don't know, I never tried it.
- Didn't you ask her to?
- Who?
- That girl.
I told you, I wouldn't ask any woman.
What if she were willing?
Yeah, that's what they all say.
Women think they can take it, but they can't.
The minute you're in the air they call the airport.
When you get down, you find them waiting, so scared they hate you.
What if she were the type that didn't scare easily?
- There's no such animal.
- Now, how do you know?
The girl I was telling you about came as close to it as anybody I ever met.
But one night when I was lost in a fog and was glad to get back down, what do you think the welcome-home speech was? She'd hoped I'd crashed.
- What?
- She couldn't stand the gaff.
Said she'd rather see me dead, have it over with.
Told me if I didn't quit flying, it was all off.
- You wouldn't, would you?
- I'm still flying.
- Wonder what happened to her.
- Who?
I don't know for sure.
I heard she married another flyer.
Is there anything else you'd like to know about me?
Would you like to go over to my room?
Got some letters from home.
Pictures of my parents and of me my first time up in the air.
- Pictures of my first crash.
- Any of you as a baby?
I don't remember. Wanna go and look?
Sure.
Bonnie, keep on the way we're going.
It'll take you to the boat.
- Well...
- I've got to stick around here.
- So that's where we were going.
- Take care of yourself.
- Geoff.
- What?
Tex just called. He says the pass is clearing.
- Did you wake Les up?
- No.
Because...Tex says it's nobody's picnic.
- All right, wind up number seven.
- I already did.
So long, Bonnie. Have a nice trip.
- Wait. Are you going up yourself?
- Sure.
- When will you be back?
- Takes three hours each way.
Won't be back until after your boat sails.
I'll look you up in New York.
- What?
- What?
- You'll look me up in New York? When...
- Sure, I'll see you there.
- What did you say?
- When are you coming?
Next week, two o'clock.
I liked saying goodbye.
Let's try it again.
So long, Bonnie.
Say, things happen awful fast around here.
Is this going to be dangerous?
What do you wanna do?
Put a net under him?
Well, lady, you're really better off this way.
Sure, I guess...
Now, look, I hardly know the man.
Sure, but you'll get over it.
Bye, Miss Lee.
I gotta keep tabs on him.
Bye.
Calling Lookout, calling Lookout.
- Hello, Kid. Did Geoff get down all right?
- Sure, he's all right.
That's good. I couldn't see him when he passed here. Signing off.
That was a pretty quick trip you made.
I still say it was pretty quick.
- Shut up.
- Well, it wasn't slow.
Morning, Charlie.
How about a hot cup of...
Hello.
- What are you doing?
- Having breakfast.
- Is your boat still here?
- No.
Has it sailed?
How did you get left behind?
Oh, I just...
- Go on.
- Well, I just told the man.
- Told him what?
- '' Put my trunk on the dock.''
- Yeah, why?
- Well...
I couldn't stay over without having anything to wear.
What's so strange about that?
- Doesn't it seem strange to you?
- What?
Getting off that boat.
Well, doesn't it?
Well, I don't know.
The girl that got off that boat is a perfect stranger to me.
I don't know. I don't know whether this is me or another fellow.
Bonnie Lee ought to be sound asleep on that boat, far out to sea.
She's not so far out to sea as you think.
- Who?
- The boat.
Kid, put more gas in number seven, call
Santa Maria. Have them hold the boat.
- Where's your luggage?
- Over there.
Good. Charlie...
What are you waiting for?
Boat doesn't stop there this trip.
They have no bananas.
- They have no bananas?
- Yes, they have no bananas.
Shut up.
Don't worry. You don't have to bother about me, I'm cured.
- There's a first time for everything.
- What do you mean?
I've never made such a chump out of myself. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I...
No, I'm not either. I'm glad.
- You're not making sense.
- You're telling me.
If I'd taken that boat I'd have gone remembering a swell guy.
Someone who lived up to a screwy ideal that I... I don't know.
- I didn't ask you to stay. I wouldn't...
- ...ask any woman to do anything.
There's something else I wouldn't do.
- What?
- Get burned twice in the same place.
- Another boat leaves next week.
- I'll be on it.
Good. I'm gonna get some sleep, Kid.
If you're gonna be here a week, we better find some place for you to park.
Yeah, I guess so.
Can I have a nice room with a bath?
I'll see what I can do.
You know,
I always did like a bath better than a shower.
Good morning, Doc.
What are you doing here?
What are you d...
Yeah, thanks, Doc, thanks.
What's he saying?
He's waiting for a call from the San Felipe mine.
Hartwood's son has had an accident.
- How bad?
- That's what we're waiting to find out.
You can't put a plane down there.
It's worse than getting a piano over a transom.
Come on in.
Who's gonna meet the southbound boat?
- You could send Les.
- You go. That new flyer's coming in.
- What's his name?
- Mac something.
MacPherson, ain't it?
- What is it?
- What's the difference, if he can fly?
Can't afford to be fussy down here.
- Now go on. Go and meet the boat.
- All right.
- Tell Charlie to get me some breakfast.
- Yes, sir.
Hey, Sparks, try Hartwood again, will you?
Well, here's the mail.
And his name is MacPherson.
- How did you find that out?
- He told me.
- Where is he?
- Putting his things in his room.
- I'll be out in a minute.
- All right.
- Don't strain yourself.
- Yes, sir.
Your room all right, Mr MacPherson?
- It'll do.
- Let's get you acquainted around here.
Boys, this is Mr MacPherson, our new flyer.
- Welcome to our fair city.
- Les Peters. This is Gent Shelton.
Mike, this is Mr MacPherson.
Our head mechanic.
- How are you?
- How are you?
- Too early to buy a drink?
- No. Where are you from?
- Mexico City.
- What stuff are they using?
The same old Fokkers and Fords.
- Well, look who...
- Felisa, Elena, how are you?
I didn't know you'd come.
Mac, you'll have to buy more drinks.
- This is Elena Silva and Felisa...
- Torres.
...Torres. Mr MacPherson, this is Michael.
- Get a good sleep?
- No!
Mr MacPherson is here.
- Mr MacPherson.
- Geoff!
Excuse me. Hello!
- Well, how are you, Lola?
- Not Lola, Felisa.
Oh yeah, that's right.
Well, Felisa, how's Panama?
Oh, Geoff. It was Puerto Rico.
- Is that where it was?
- Yeah.
I can't remember names.
I'm better at faces. I...
Your name's not MacPherson, it's Kilgallon.
- You're not so bad on names after all.
- Kilgallon.
- You heard him.
- Bat Kilgallon.
- That's right.
- Well, what about it?
He's not the first to come here under a different name.
No, but he's the first pilot who ever bailed out and let his mechanic crash.
Habit of yours, being right, isn't it?
- Look, you don't want...
- Cut it out, Les. Hey...
Did you know the Kid was working down here?
- What?
- He is.
I don't think there's anything funny about that.
You're right, there isn't. But I had to come a long way to find it out.
- Of all the cast-iron crust...
- Don't flatter me.
What's the Kid got to do with it?
Nothing, except it was his brother that was killed when this guy took to his parachute.
I've had enough of this.
Do you mind, Elena? We're...
Come on, baby.
Coming, Geoff?
- No, this is good enough for me.
- Not so particular, huh?
Even you couldn't spoil good liquor.
Thanks, I'm not used to these small favours.
I'm sorry I said it. I'm not used to being around people like you.
- That's the Kid coming in.
- Geoff, what are we...
Quiet, Dutch.
Better make yourself scarce.
- The Kid carries a gun.
- Aren't you getting careful of me?
It's gonna be inconvenient for me if they slap the Kid in the hoosegow.
- I have to meet him sooner or later.
- Yeah, maybe you're right.
Well, it's your funeral.
All passengers aboard the boat.
All passengers aboard the boat.
I remember, it was Puerto Rico.
So long.
It's hot on the ground.
Give me some cold water, Baldy.
Who's got a match?
What's the matter?
It's like walking on a graveyard.
Oh, hello.
You the new guy?
Welcome to our city. My name...
Hello, Kilgallon.
Long time no see.
That's right.
I thought there was something.
Look...
I'm all right.
Two years ago I'd have broke your...
Keep out of my sight.
I might still do it.
It's none of my business, but why did you stop him?
- It's none of your business.
- Bat.
Judy, I want you to meet these people.
Gentlemen, this is Mrs MacPherson.
Mr...
- My name is Shelton.
- Mr Shelton.
- This is Les Peters.
- Mr Peters.
- Mr Van Ruyter, our boss.
- He met us at the boat.
And...Geoff Carter.
- Mrs MacPherson.
- Mr Carter.
- I forgot to ask you for the trunk keys.
- Oh, yes, you did.
- I interrupted something.
- Not at all.
There. I'll see you in a few minutes.
I'm glad to have met everyone.
No, she doesn't know about me.
- Come on.
- You're not putting him to work?
Also none of your business.
Who's running this airline?
You are. But you don't seem to remember that.
- Did you get old man Hartwood yet?
- No, the line's still busy.
- You do some queer things, Kilgallon.
- MacPherson's the name.
That's what I mean.
Why didn't you tell her?
When does the next boat leave?
Have you got enough dough for your passages?
No.
That's fine.
- I wonder if I could...
- What?
- Cram you down their throats.
- That bunch in there?
- Yeah.
- I wouldn't mind choking a few of them.
Hello? Mr Hartwood,
I've been trying to get you.
I've got to get my boy out or bring a doctor in.
I'd like to help, but I can't lose a plane.
I know the Dutchman's hard up. Get a doctor, you can write your own ticket.
- I'll take responsibility for the plane.
- Yeah? Wait a minute.
- Hey, you want a chance?
- What do you think?
- You'll make your passage home.
- That's all right with me.
Mr Hartwood, you've got a deal.
Put up some smoke so we can tell about the wind. Sure, goodbye.
Sparks, get the doctor.
You're taking him to a boy who's hurt.
- It's a bad place to get into.
- Got a map?
I'll get you one.
- Here he is, Geoff.
- Hello, Doc.
Tell him it's no cinch. He doesn't have to go unless he wants to.
Here we are, and here's the mine.
It's situated on a small plain...
Sure, Doc.
- That's right, Doc.
- I go!
I go!
- He's going.
- You hurt his feelings.
- Why?
- He was quoting Shakespeare.
Henry IV, I think.
He said, ''A man can die but once.
We owe God a death.''
If we pay it today, we don't owe it tomorrow.
He's no fool.
They'll be waiting for you on the field.
How do you get over this stuff?
There's a pass, 14,000 feet. See it?
- Right.
- OK.
When you land, come in short or you'll run out of ground. There's a big drop.
- Thanks.
- OK. For what?
I'll get things ready for him.
Listen, tell the Kid I want to see him, will you?
Hello, Kid. Put down those shades.
Hey...what about this guy
Kilgallon or MacPherson?
- Come over here.
- You're not putting him to work?
We'll talk about that later.
Here, sit down.
- Giving me an eye test?
- Read that fourth line.
- You're not worried about my eyes?
- I have been for some time.
- Because I didn't know him right off?
- Quit stalling.
- I, P, E, D.
- That's very good.
- I could've told you.
- Stay there.
I got a new one for you.
Fourth line on this.
P, T, E, O.
Try the fifth.
F, Z, B, D, E.
Now read it backwards.
- E, D, B, Z, F.
- That's better than I can do.
- What about this guy?
- You're not through yet.
- Take a shot at this.
- Where did you get that?
Mike made it.
Here you are.
Go ahead, line them up.
- They're together now.
- Yeah.
- How did I do?
- Not bad.
Well, what about Kilgallon?
- He's not staying here, is he?
- Why not?
I thought you'd be the last guy to ask that.
- He's no good and you know it.
- Now, take it easy.
Is he worse than the guy who'd double-cross his friend?
Kid, anything you do is all right with me.
But if Dutch loses another plane, he's cooked.
I thought he was rolling in dough.
Why do you think that new motor is still at the dock?
Yeah, I did wonder about that.
Look, Kid, here it is.
Dutchy made an agreement.
If he gets the mail out on schedule for six months, he'll get a contract and a subsidy.
You know what that would mean?
Plenty of money, no more second-hand junk to fly.
These new jobs can get over those peaks in any weather.
That would be nice.
When did this schedule start?
Six months ago.
Only one more week, or at least until the northbound boat arrives.
That's why you've been forcing things?
Why didn't you tell a fella?
- Dutchy.
- Dutchy, how?
He was afraid if you guys knew the spot he was in, you'd take chances.
What a guy.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, you were right about my eyes.
I couldn't read those cards.
I learned them by heart.
What about the new one?
Dutchy told me where you hid it.
- The old fool, double-crossing himself.
- He wasn't thinking about that.
He was thinking how you'd feel, grounding me.
You're through flying, Kid.
After 22 years.
I guess that's long enough for anybody.
You're gonna need that...
Kilgallon, aren't you?
I might.
Well, if you do...you can forget how I feel about him.
Thanks.
Kid. There's a lot you can do round here to help me.
Oh, sure, I know.
I can help Mike. I can...
Sure.
Calling MacPherson, calling MacPherson.
- Go ahead.
- Radio check.
One, two, three, four, five.
OK, report when you get there.
Fasten your belt.
Your belt.
- Calling Barranca. Calling Barranca.
- Go ahead.
MacPherson speaking.
We got down all right.
We've got to get him to the hospital.
They're loading him in now.
His father is coming, too.
Can you get out with that extra weight?
Well, I got a little help from the wind.
I'll go off the ledge, use the canyon to pick up speed.
- Let me know if you make it.
- OK.
Brace yourselves.
This is gonna be quite a drop.
- Calling Barranca, calling Barranca.
- Go ahead.
MacPherson speaking. We got out all right. All in one piece.
What do you want me to do?
Pat you on the back?
Signing off.
Come in.
Busy?
- It all seems very natural.
- Yes, it does, doesn't it?
- Like my hair this way?
- I thought it was different.
- I couldn't believe it. I had no idea...
- It's a pretty small world.
- Hello, Geoff.
- Hello, Judy.
I'm not sure we should've done that.
Same old goo.
You haven't changed a bit.
No.
- Were you surprised to find me married?
- No.
No, somebody wrote me something about it.
I thought you'd had enough of flyers.
So did I.
- Are you getting along all right?
- I'm very happy.
Did...
- Did you tell him about us?
- He never asked me.
I wish you all the luck in the world.
Anything I can do...
Would you do something about our room?
- What's the matter with it?
- Remember the one I had at Catalina?
It's even smaller. And no bath.
I'll do what I can, Judy.
This is Miss Lee. Miss Lee has to know about everything.
- She'd like to ask you some questions.
- I would not!
Never mind.
- Still at it, aren't you, Geoff?
- What? Oh, you mean...
No, no, she's stopping over between boats.
- At your invitation?
- My invitation? I wouldn't ask...
...any woman to do anything.
I've heard that before.
No, you can't keep that up forever.
- You'll meet someone you'll have to ask.
- I haven't so far.
Cut it out. Cut it out!
- Come on, come on. You all right?
- Yeah, sure.
- Take him in there.
- Come on, Kid.
Take it easy.
You'll do. Why don't you two pick on somebody you can handle?
- I think it's busted.
- Yeah?
Try and move your fingers.
- Not a wiggle.
- Oh, that's fine. What started this?
The Kid came in, had a couple of drinks.
Gent and I squawked about working with Bat.
- One thing led to another.
- Gonna quit?
- That was the idea.
- I wound up on the floor.
- He acted like he was crazy.
- You'd be crazy, too.
- Yeah, why?
- I had to ground him.
He's through flying.
- No.
- His eyes?
- That's tough.
- No wonder he went nuts.
- You'd better take that to the hospital.
- I wanna talk to the Kid first.
Me, too.
Mr Peters, what did you say about working with my husband?
- I didn't say anything.
- Why should you?
I guess you misunderstood, lady.
Look, Kid...
We didn't know anything about...
Geoff just told us the bad news.
Yeah? Still figure on quitting?
If you can stand that guy we've got no right to kick.
OK, forget it.
- Hey.
- I didn't pick out a good place to land.
I'm sorry about that other thing.
I didn't get this by walking into a door.
Come on, kiss it and make it well.
It's better already.
Les, get that arm down to the hospital right away.
Well, now you're another guy short.
Well, that's how it goes.
I certainly am a great help to you, Geoff.
We'll get along all right.
Maybe I could teach Dutchy to fly.
Who, me? No, I don't want to.
- Now, who's running this airline?
- Oh, Geoff, please include me out.
That's not a bad idea.
No, Geoff, I don't want to fly.
No, no, no. Cheer up.
Hartwood said to give you this.
- If it isn't satisfactory, let him know.
- Wait a minute.
Oh, yeah, I forgot.
What about my passage money?
You don't need it. You got the job.
Maybe I ought to pat you on the back.
You don't have to.
Just do what I tell you.
You mean anything that's too tough for somebody else?
Yeah. Yeah, that's about it.
I'm knee-deep in friends around here, but I can send you out in any weather, on any job,
- and only worry about the ship.
- I see.
On those terms, you still want the job?
- I don't know any other way I'd want it.
- Good.
Look around the field, get acquainted.
Anything you wanna know, ask Mike.
If he won't talk to you... tell him it's orders.
Yes, sir.
Dutch. Come and get it, boy.
Now you can get that ship out of hock.
I'm afraid we need more than...
Isn't that too much?
- Not for that kind of flying.
- Oh, Geoff, I don't know.
If you wanna thank somebody, thank him. You could get him a decent room.
- I haven't got a thing.
- The one up on the balcony?
Miss Lee's in that.
- Right next to me?
- Yes, I thought...
- Get her out of there.
- All right, if you want.
- I do. But get the ship first.
- Yes.
- Get it up here as fast as you can.
- Sure.
Hello.
- Hello.
- Hello, Bonnie. How are you doing?
Not bad. After spending a night in that mouse auditorium I'm sleeping in.
Just room enough for me and a Flit-gun.
- I thought we'd fixed you up pretty good.
- You did.
Mr Carter had other ideas.
You warned me.
Isn't that girl the one he used to be in love with?
Bonnie, when it rains, every third drop falls on one of them.
I can believe that all right.
They come right out of the woodwork.
- More power to him.
- Sure.
You don't think I care about that, do you?
I don't. See?
Just like to tell him what I think of him.
All you have to do is raise your voice a little.
- Is that him?
- The old master himself.
What's he doing?
Testing a smashed-up plane
Mike stuck together with a little glue.
Or did you use baling wire this time, Mike?
- Don't worry, those wings'll stay on.
- We'll soon find out.
- Hey. Hey!
- He's not trying to do that.
- I can't see.
- She's out of control.
- Now he's out of it.
- Geoff, get out.
- Jump. What's he doing?
- He's gonna try to land.
- He can't make it.
- Get set for a crash, Mike!
- Why doesn't he jump?
- Why should he? He's made of rubber.
- He wants to see how high he bounces.
- Shut up!
I'm getting too old for...
What's the matter?
I don't know. I...I...
- Can I come in?
- Sure.
Here.
This is good for the stomach.
- It won't help much for what ails you.
- You didn't tell him what a baby I was?
- No, I skipped that one.
- You won't tell him, will you?
After that, have you still got your chin stuck out for more?
I know I'm a fool, but I can't do anything about it.
- He won't quit flying, Bonnie.
- I wouldn't ask him to.
You don't believe that, do you?
You'll have a hard time making him believe it.
Think you can take that sort of thing day after day?
You love him, don't you, Kid?
- Yes, I guess I do.
- Why can't I love him the way you do?
Why couldn't I sneer when he tries to kill himself, feel proud when he doesn't?
Why couldn't I meet him when he gets back? Why couldn't I...
What do you do when he doesn't come back when you expect him to?
I go nuts.
Gee whizz, you're a great help.
- That's fine.
- What's up?
A new low has formed on the ocean.
It's gonna bring that storm here.
- When do they expect it?
- Maybe tonight.
- How big?
- I don't know yet.
Fine time for dirty weather. Poor Dutchy.
There's no use moaning.
Go and help with that new ship.
- What good'll that do?
- Tell them to stay with it.
Someday I'll get a straight answer.
Geoff. Wait a minute. They're loading number eight with nitroglycerine.
Right, to take into the oil fields.
Baldy, anything you've got.
We aren't meant to fly that with the mail.
- I know.
- Nothing in my contract says I'll fly that.
- You're getting a buck and a half a mile.
- Not me.
- What?
- I saw a guy blow a tyre once.
From the other end of the field it broke a bottle in my pocket.
- Where's your map?
- I don't like that stuff.
- Who does?
- I'll do anything else.
I know.
Here you are, MacPherson.
Once you're through the pass the oil fields are 200 miles north.
Give me a match, Dutch.
You weren't kidding me the other day, were you?
- Dutch, figure out Gent's time.
- What?
- What did you say?
- You're through.
- What's the matter with you?
- You can't blame that boy.
I'm not. He's fired, that's all. Sorry.
Geoff, I don't like that. The way you...
How about clearing the field before MacPherson takes off?
- Nitro.
- Oh, my goodness, you said it!
I didn't think of that at all.
- How's this stuff packed?
- All in rubber.
Here's a trapdoor if you wanna get rid of it.
Thanks.
OK.
None of that stuff for me.
- Watch it for a minute, will you?
- Sure.
- Hello, Judy.
- I...I'd like to talk to you.
- What's on your mind?
- Bat. He's carrying nitroglycerine.
Don't worry, he's pretty good.
- But it's very dangerous.
- Not while he's in the air.
- Run along, let Bat do the worrying.
- Don't be like that with me.
Why does he always get things like this to do? Please.
I told you I was happy, but I lied to you.
Why don't people wanna work with him?
What's he done that makes people act that way?
- Why ask me?
- You're the only one I can ask. Please!
- Can't you see...
- Calling Barranca. Calling Barranca.
- Go ahead, Tex.
- Wind's coming up.
It's closing in fast.
- Have you seen MacPherson yet?
- Went by a couple of minutes ago.
All right. Calling MacPherson.
You'd better run along, Judy.
- No, Geoff, I'm staying.
- Calling MacPherson.
- Is your weather good or bad?
- There's a chance to get through.
Is it good or bad?
- Bad.
- All right, come back.
- When you can, dump that nitro.
- I can get this stuff down.
I said dump it! And watch yourself.
There's a flock of big birds in the pass.
He could drop that soup on them.
- D'you hear, MacPherson?
- Yeah.
Tex will line you up on 'em.
- Feeling better, Judy?
- Thanks, Geoff.
Now, will you tell me what he's done?
No. No, you'll have to ask him.
You...you think that'll be easy to do?
Start dropping them after you've passed that second peak.
That oughta move 'em!
Drop the rest before you get back.
Too bad I couldn't get through.
I left the mail on the ship.
You're taking it up again as soon as Tex clears you.
Calling Look out, calling Look out.
- Go ahead.
- MacPherson speaking.
An hour out of Las Cruces. Clear ahead.
- Clear here.
- Signing off.
Calling Barranca, calling Barranca.
- Go ahead, Tex.
- MacPherson coming back.
- An hour out of Las Cruces.
- OK, Tex.
Only one more trip, you got your contract.
Only one more. If this rain keeps up, we'll need pontoons.
- Anything else?
- Yeah. Get those motors ready.
I wanna run a test on them.
Hello.
- What are you doing?
- Looking for a corkscrew.
- You should get some sleep.
- Seems like an excellent suggestion.
Look what I won. We'll make a nightcap out of it as soon as I find a corkscrew.
Lock the doors.
Judy's lost her equilibrium.
You'll lose something else if you put that stuff on top of it.
I'm getting used to losing things.
Did you ask him?
Is that why you're celebrating?
He wouldn't tell me.
Said it had nothing to do with us.
So, it seems that that's that. It's all over.
You're gonna let him go it all by himself?
Did you ever hear the word ''trust''?
I did once, but I forgot it.
I don't blame him for not telling you.
Maybe he wanted to find out what he'd got.
You're no good and you never were.
Give me that before you cut your hand.
I used to wonder if I was right when we broke up.
- I don't have to worry any more.
- What did I do?
You don't know what I'm talking about.
You've got some listening to do and you're gonna hear every word.
It'll do you good.
What do you care what he did? Why do you have to know? Wipe your eyes.
If it was so bad he can't tell you, how d'you think he feels?
You're like all the rest, you don't know what it means to stick. Blow your nose.
Now go to bed.
Hey, you! Don't come in, don't come in!
- What are you doing here?
- I've been taking a bath.
I know that. You've got a nerve.
You can't take a bath in a washbasin.
- Why pick on my room?
- It's the only clean one I could find.
- Hurry it up, will you?
- I'm hurrying.
- What's all this?
- What?
All this cooking.
That's coffee. Don't touch it, it's hot!
- I told you...
- Go away, go away.
- I'll put butter on it.
- I don't want any butter on it.
- My grandmother always used butter.
- I don't care.
It's still boiling. What's all this about?
I thought I'd like a nice cup of coffee.
It's so cold outside and so cosy in here.
- Would you like one?
- No. Get out and take this...
- I thought you never did that.
- Did what?
Got burned twice in the same place.
Geoff? Geoff?
Geoff, I'm... Oh.
- I'm sorry, I'll go.
- No, it's all right.
- Maybe I'd better go.
- No, please don't.
- I really didn't intend to.
- I wanted to thank Geoff for something.
There's no reason for you not to know.
You were right, I'm no good.
I was only thinking of myself, not how to help him.
I'm glad you didn't tell me what he's done. I just want another chance.
- Why not tell him that?
- When will he be back?
- Two or three hours.
- That's a long time.
Tell Sparks I said you could talk to him on the radio.
Thanks.
I didn't know you had a matrimonial agency on the side.
Just goes to show you how wrong you can be.
- Where do you keep those pictures?
- What pictures?
Those pictures of you as a baby.
- We're right back where we started.
- That was a million years ago.
- What's the matter with your foot?
- I slipped on the porch.
- Don't walk around on it.
- There's nothing the matter with it.
- Let me put you down and look at it.
- I just lost the heel off my slipper.
- Why didn't you say so?
- I have the darndest luck.
Losing one heel right after another.
- You're a queer duck, Bonnie.
- So are you.
Geoff, you don't have to be afraid of me any more.
I'm not trying to tie you down.
I don't wanna plan,
I don't wanna look ahead.
I don't want you to change anything.
I love you, Geoff. There's nothing
I can do about it, I just love you.
I feel the same way that Kid does.
- Anything you do is all right with me.
- The Kid?
Yes, he doesn't ask you for anything or get in your way or bother you, does he?
He drives me nuts.
Hey, Geoff.
Hey, Geoff, I... Oh.
- Oh, sure, come in.
- Sorry.
We might just as well be in Grand Central Station.
I could make a fortune with a hot-dog stand.
I'm sorry. Boys are ready to test those motors.
Oh, all right.
Do you have yours with mustard or without?
- This has gotta be done, Bonnie.
- See if you can find it. It's in there.
- What?
- That picture we were talking about.
And keep the coffee warm, will you?
I didn't know. I'm sorry.
- Boat's in, Geoff.
- Thanks, I heard it.
Calling Lookout, calling Lookout.
- Go ahead.
- The boat's in.
Number four will be taking off.
- You can't get through this stuff.
- Gonna try to go over the top.
That don't sound so good. I almost forgot, I need another generator belt.
- What happened?
- Napoleon ate the spare.
- What's he doing in there?
- It's to keep him from blowing away.
- Rig up something.
- With what?
Don't ask me.
A piece of Napoleon's hide.
I'll find something.
- All set out there?
- All ready, Geoff.
Took out all the seats, stripped her clean.
- Fine.
- Yeah, I got 400 pounds.
You know, that's more than twice what I weigh.
I don't suppose there's anything else you can do.
- Look here, Geoff...
- I heard you the first time.
- You're not going.
- Why not?
I'll toss you a coin for it. Heads, I go.
Wait. Go away, go away.
Why are you so anxious about this?
I'm not anxious.
- Heads on both sides.
- Really? No kidding?
- That's right, it is.
- ''That's right, it is.''
No wonder I've been buying you drinks all year.
I wanna go with you, Pop. Please.
- OK, if you feel that way about it.
- Gimme, gimme.
- Put another bottle of oxygen in.
- I already did.
- I'll take a cup of that, Charlie.
- Yes, Mr Geoff.
Dutchy, who went to meet the boat?
Why ask me? You are running this airline, aren't you?
- MacPherson's picking up the mail.
- I want to ask you a question.
Don't you think you are crazy to fly in that weather?
- Get the lights ready.
- I've told you...
Whatever you do, don't think you have to do it for me.
I'd rather be broke. I don't care whether we get that contract or not.
- Don't strain yourself, Dutch.
- What's the use?
- Hello, Bonnie.
- Hello.
- What's this?
- I started that lunch wagon.
The coffee was awfully hot when
I put it in, so don't burn yourself again.
- Thanks, Bonnie.
- Have a nice trip, Geoff.
- See you next week, two o'clock.
- Yes.
- Where are you going?
- Over the room.
- What for?
- My boat's in. I'd better finish packing.
Oh, yeah.
- That's the outfit you came ashore in.
- How did you remember that?
Got a match?
Don't you think it's time you started carrying some?
I'm sorry, Geoff. I'm sorry to be so silly.
I wanted to do this just the way you do.
I was all right until you asked for that match, wasn't I?
- You sure were.
- Just remember it up till then.
Look, Bonnie, are you sorry about...anything?
- Are you?
- No.
I'm not.
So long, Bonnie.
Oh, Geoff! Geoff, I can't let you go.
- This has got to stop.
- No. No, I can't!
- Come on now.
- I won't...I won't let you go.
You're not going to go.
I won't let you kill yourself.
You're gonna do it to keep me from doing it.
- You're just like all the rest.
- No, I'm not!
- Geoff! What have I done?
- Go away, Bonnie.
- Darling, I didn't mean to!
- I know. It's my own fault.
He's shot!
- Shot? Get that coat off.
- Where's the first-aid kit?
In the corner. Does this hurt?
- Get the doctor right away. Who did it?
- I did.
- You? How'd it happen?
- I didn't want him to go.
- He's not likely to now.
- That sure looks bad.
What is this, a sideshow?
Clear out of here.
Don't get excited.
Baldy, get me a drink, will you?
Bonnie, put some water on the stove.
Hold that, Sparks.
It didn't come through, it's still in there.
- Here you are, Geoff.
- Thanks.
- What do you say, Kid?
- It's all right.
- But you're not gonna do much flying.
- You're crazy.
Try to move it. You've joined the rest of us cripples.
- Soon there'll be none of us left.
- Perfect.
- You don't think I can fly her alone?
- You're not good enough alone.
I'm a lot better than anyone you got left around here.
How were you gonna get through?
- Over the top in the new tri-motor.
- Will she go that high?
- I don't know.
- I'll see that you find out.
Kid was going with me.
- You think I might get lost.
- I'll see that you don't.
You don't have to go.
It's not that kind of job.
That's fair enough. There's the mail.
- I'll see you on the field.
- I'll be waiting.
There's a parachute, if you want it.
It's OK.
All clear.
- He'd rather take it out at the hospital.
- Tell him to do it here.
Calling Barranca, calling Barranca.
- Calling Barranca.
- Go ahead.
Still on instruments, still on instruments.
Calling Barranca. Calling Barranca.
On top, first layer. On top, first layer.
Calling Barranca, calling Barranca.
Picking up a little ice.
Rate of climb 320. Rate of climb 320.
Calling Barranca, calling Barranca.
Near ceiling, near ceiling.
I never saw one of these things yet could go through the side of a mountain.
Here she goes!
- What have we got under us?
- You're safe till 6,000.
I'll wait till the air is heavier.
- D'you want me to try it again?
- No use.
She's not good enough by more than 1,000 feet.
- Calling Barranca.
- Go ahead, Geoff.
- Quiet, Doc.
- We couldn't mak e it.
- Almost 16,000, the bottom fell out.
- Tell him to come back.
Heard you, Geoff. Not coming back.
Don't be a fool, Kid.
I've been flying blind for two months.
Won't do any harm to do it once more.
Come back.
Those are orders, d'you hear?
No dice, Geoff. Signing off.
- Tell Tex to watch for him.
- Calling Lookout.
- Number four is gonna try the pass.
- It's closed in thick er than glue.
All clear below.
Get in one of those chutes and jump.
Is there any reason I can't go, too?
You don't have to.
Which way is the pass from here?
10 degrees north. 3,000 up.
I can hear 'em.
They're starting through.
They're in the pass now.
Kid. Kid, answer.
Kid, answer.
- Calling Barranca.
- Go ahead, Tex.
They just went by. I tried to talk to them but they wouldn't answer.
- Keep trying.
- OK.
Kid! Kid!
Hey, Kid!
- Kid!
- Yeah?
Get out quick and jump!
There's something broken. I can't move.
- Jump yourself.
- Not this time.
Oh, you fool!
Number four's on fire! They're heading back. I don't think they can make it.
Plug in that outside set.
Get me a coat, somebody.
Turn on the lights in the field.
Kid. Calling number four.
- Calling number four.
- There!
- They'll never get her down.
- Kid, number four, jump! Bail out!
Get them out!
- Get the mail!
- All right!
- We got you.
- He's hurt pretty bad!
Stand back.
All right?
Come on, get out.
Come on!
OK, Doc, that's fine, that's fine.
Cut it out, come on.
Geoff, tell this guy to quit fussing with me.
Let him alone, Doc.
Cigarette, Poppa?
Sure. Here you are.
How's the other guy?
Hands burned and one side of his face.
He's all right, Geoff.
Could have jumped but he didn't.
He sat right there, took it like it was an ice-cream soda.
- Buy him a drink for me.
- Sure I will.
If it hadn't been for those birds, we'd have made it.
Sure you would.
I'd make a windshield at an angle.
Then they'd bounce off.
- Not a bad idea.
- Make you a present of it.
When I get on my feet, we'll work it out.
Or will we?
Your neck's broken, Kid.
Funny.
I wondered why I... couldn't feel anything.
Well...I guess this is it, huh?
Bad sport.
- What is it?
- Get that bunch out of here.
Get out of here. Hurry up.
You too, Doc. Use both feet.
What is it, fella? You can tell me.
- I didn't want them to see me.
- Sure.
- I'm not scared.
- Course you're not.
It's just that...
It's like doing something new.
Like...when I made my first solo.
I didn't want anybody watching then, either.
Yes.
I don't know how good
I'm gonna be at this.
D'you want me to go, too?
I'd hate to pull a boner in front of you, Geoff.
Sure. Sure, I know.
Here you are.
- So long, Kid.
- So long, Geoff.
Hello, Dutch.
Got a match?
Here, the final pay cheques.
The field is closed down.
We are licked.
OK, Dutchy.
- Calling Lookout, calling Lookout.
- Go ahead, Geoff.
Let me know when it clears.
We're all set down here.
What about the Kid, Geoff?
Broke his neck.
Took off a few minutes ago.
- Deal me in.
- Get a seat.
- Hello, Les.
- I took care of everything on the field.
Thanks. Get me a drink, Baldy.
- You send for me, Carter?
- Yes.
The...the Kid asked me to buy you a drink.
Thanks.
Baldy, put it on the table, will you?
- Why not have it with us?
- Sure. Why not? How about you, Judy?
- Thanks.
- Baldy, set 'em up.
- Have that.
- How are the hands coming?
Not bad.
- Here you are, fella.
- He'll spill it.
- Got it?
- OK now?
- Can you make it?
- I'll be all right.
- Here you are, Judy.
- Thanks.
- Come on, drink hearty.
- Here's how.
Here's everything I could find.
- Help yourself.
- No, I don't want any.
Not much to show for 22 years of...
- So long, Sparks.
- Going, Bonnie?
Nobody asked me to stay.
All the things that have been happening to me and I haven't got a picture to show for it.
Aren't you gonna say goodbye to him?
I think you ought to.
You do?
I think he'd want you to.
Are you sure?
He might not act like it, but I think he would.
Well, if you think I ought to.
I think you should.
I don't mind doing it if you say so.
- I do say so.
- You do?
Well, I guess I better go in and do it, then.
- Hello, Geoff.
- Hello, Bonnie.
I...just thought I wanted to...
Well... Sparks said I ought to...
He thought that before I go I'd better...
I don't know why I just...
That's all I wanted to say, was just...
He said you'd like it, but I don't know, you never...
Geoff.
Geoff. Oh, Geoff, you're crying.
Oh, please don't. I...
I'll never be able to...
Never be able to what, Bonnie?
- I'll never be able to say it if you...
- Say what?
I was going to say goodbye.
Geoff...do you want me to stay or don't you?
- Well, Bonnie...
- Calling Barranca. Calling Barranca.
What's the matter down there?
- Go ahead, Tex.
- Storm's breaking up.
- Wind's down to a whisper.
- Wait a minute.
Sparks! Get him, will you, Bonnie?
- How's the pass?
- Clearing up fast.
- What do you want?
- Wind up number seven.
- Start number seven.
- How about it, Tex?
Stand by. It won't be long now.
Moon's breaking through.
Here she comes.
She's shining harder than $700.
- Let 'em come!
- We're coming. How about it?
- You and me? Let's get going!
- What d'you think of that, Dutchy?
- What is...?
- The pass is clearing.
- Just got time.
- How are you going to fly?
- I've got one good arm.
- I don't know if that's...
Your contract's as good as in the bag.
- Come on, chaps.
- So long, Bonnie.
- Keep that coffee warm.
- I'm going on the boat.
- Yeah?
- Nobody asked me to stay.
- They haven't?
- You won't ask anybody to do anything.
That's right. We'll flip a coin.
Tails you go, heads you stay.
- Heads. What about it?
- I won't stay that way.
- You won't?
- I'm hard to get, Geoff.
All you have to do is ask me.
Here's a souvenir for you.
I like saying goodbye.
So long, Bonnie.
Son of a gun.
Hey!
Hey, Geoff! Ge...
News has come from Vienna!
"Leopold of Austria has seized King Richard on his return from the Crusades.
Our king is being held prisoner.
Nothing further is known.
His Highness Prince John will make further public pronouncement tomorrow."
And how are the dear Saxons taking the news, Sir Guy?
They're even more worried than Longchamps,
Your Highness.
They'll be more than worried when I squeeze the fat out of their pampered hides.
- You intend to act on your plans?
- What better moment than this, Sir Guy?
Whoever would have thought my dear brother would be so considerate as to get captured...
...and leave all of England to my tender care?
He may disapprove when he returns,
Your Highness.
If he returns.
And I'll see to it that he doesn't.
We must drink to this moment, Sir Guy.
Golden days are ahead.
I'll assign tax districts to you tomorrow.
Tomorrow, Your Highness.
- But who's gonna pay me?
- Pay! Pay!
That's all you Saxons think about.
Didn't I tell you it was for Prince John, who's just come up from London?
Stop! Stop!
This man is freeborn!
He's a landowner.
You can't make a slave of him!
Didn't he refuse to send his men to work in Guy of Gisbourne's field?
But I protest...!
Dickon, follow me!
The rest remain here.
- What's your name, you Saxon dog?
- A better one than yours.
Look to your manners!
This is Sir Guy of Gisbourne.
Sir Guy or the devil!
There's little to choose between them.
- What's your name?
- Much, the miller's son.
- You know it's death to kill the king's deer?
- And death from hunger if I don't.
Thanks to you and the rest of you
Norman cutthroats at Nottingham Castle.
- Be quiet, you.
- I won't be quiet!
You can kill me if you like, but not until I've had my say.
You can beat and starve us Saxons now...
...but when King Richard escapes, he'll take you by the scruff of the neck...
...and fling you into the sea!
- What the devil?
- Come now, Sir Guy.
- You'd not kill a man for telling the truth?
- lf it amused me, yes.
Be thankful my humor's of a different sort.
- By what right do you interfere with justice?
- By a better right than you have to misuse it.
That goes for your master, Prince John.
I'll give him that message at the baron's meeting in Nottingham tonight.
Thank you.
He does need a bit of a talking to.
- Eh, Will?
- Yes, he has been getting rather out of hand.
- Fetch him along.
- Hold there. What's his fault?
- He's killed a royal deer.
- You're wrong. I killed that deer.
This man's my servant.
I suppose you realize the penalty for killing the king's deer is death.
- Whether for serf or noble.
- Really?
Are there no exceptions?
- Thanks, good master.
- Better look before you shoot next time.
From this day, I follow only you. There isn't a poor Saxon in Nottingham shire...
...that doesn't know and bless
Sir Robin of Locksley.
Take me as your servant.
Why, in all the forest, there isn't a hunter as good as me.
I ask no pay.
Just to follow you.
Fetch the deer, then.
While Richard is bent on adventure in foreign lands...
...it is our duty as Normans to preserve the realm...
...by giving loyal support to Prince John, the only true defender of the Norman spirit.
Hail to Prince John.
My lords, I thank you.
Well, this is what we Normans like:
Good food, good company, and a beautiful woman to flatter me, eh, Lady Marian?
Was it worthwhile coming with me from London...
...to see what stout fellows our Nottingham friends are?
Take Sir Guy of Gisbourne, now. One of our most renowned defenders of the realm.
- Must I take him, Your Highness?
- Why, you like him, don't you?
- Well, he's a Norman, of course.
- Is that the only reason for liking him?
Isn't that reason enough for a royal ward who must obey her guardian?
Oh, nay, I'd not force you, my lady.
But he's our most powerful friend in these shires and he's already in love with you.
If I could promise him marriage to a royal ward, it might help my plans.
- Perhaps when I know him better.
- Of course.
You're a very wise young woman.
Any more objections to the new tax from our Saxon friends?
Objections, Your Highness?
With a Saxon dangling from every gallows tree between here and Charnwood?
Well said, sir knight.
But not too many, mind.
Else we'll have nobody left to till our land or pay the tax.
There's one exception I'd make,
Your Highness.
- A certain Saxon noble.
- Who is that?
- Sir Robin of Locksley.
- Sir Rob... Sir Robin of Locksley?
Why, I've heard precious little else since
I've been here. What's his latest outrage?
Oh, nothing less than killing a royal deer in Sherwood Forest today.
And you didn't take him?
That would have been a problem,
Your Highness.
- A Saxon a problem?
- He's a notorious troublemaker, my lady.
Aye.
An impudent, reckless rogue...
...who goes around the shire stirring up the Saxons against authority.
And he has the insolence to set himself up as a protector of the people.
- I could have captured him long ago, but...
- But what?
Well, he's the deadliest archer in England, and...
And my brave High Sheriff of Nottingham is afraid of him.
I want him taken and hanged. At once, do you hear? I'll not tolerate...
Open the door!
Who is this, this...?
Sir Robin of Locksley, Your Highness.
Let him approach.
Greetings, Your Highness.
You should teach Gisbourne hospitality.
I no sooner enter his castle doors with a piece of meat...
...than his starving servants try to snatch it from me.
You should feed them, Gisbourne.
They'll work better.
With the compliments of your royal brother,
King Richard, God bless him!
By my faith, but you're a bold rascal.
Robin, I like you.
I'm gratified, Your Highness.
I don't think Gisbourne shares that sentiment, however.
He does look sour.
What's the matter, Gisbourne?
Run out of hangings?
- I know a ripe subject for one.
- lf you'll excuse me...
Sit down! Sit down, my dear.
He'll not harm you.
Sir Robin, this is the Lady Marian Fitzwalter.
I hope my lady had a pleasant journey from London?
What you hope can hardly be important.
What a pity her manners don't match her looks, Your Highness.
You hear that, gentlemen?
Here's Gisbourne so in love with Marian he daren't say "boo" to her...
...and this saucy fellow gives her better than she sends.
My lords and ladies, I would like to present to you Sir Robin of Locksley.
Sir Robin, permit me to present to you your host, Sir Guy of Gisbourne...
...and our noble guests.
- I'm deeply honored, Your Highness.
- Have you had meat?
- None but what I brought.
Well, sit down.
Sit down there opposite me.
- Get up, Sir lvor, and give him your place.
- Your Highness!
Get up!
Get up, sir knight!
Come, Sir lvor.
Out with you.
Bring Sir Robin food at once, do you hear?
Such impudence must support a mighty appetite.
True enough, Your Highness.
We Saxons have little to fatten on by the time your tax gatherers are through.
Be seated, gentlemen. No need to stand on ceremony on my account.
So you think you're overtaxed, eh?
Overtaxed, overworked and paid off with a knife, a club or a rope.
- Why, you speak treason.
- Fluently.
I advise you to curb that wagging tongue of yours!
It's a habit I've never formed.
You know, we Saxons aren't going to put up with these oppressions much longer.
Oh, you're not?
Then listen to this:
As you may know, my brother is a prisoner of Leopold of Austria.
And from Leopold, I have received a ransom demand of 150,000 gold marks.
That means that you, my friends...
...must collect in taxes not 2 gold marks in the pound, but 3!
- And the money's to be turned over to me.
- Why to you, Your Highness?
- King Richard appointed Longchamps regent.
- I've kicked Longchamps out.
From now on, I am regent of England.
Well, confound it, what are you goggling at?
Is it so strange that I decide to rule when my brother's a prisoner?
Who's to say I shouldn't?
- You, Sir Mortimer of Leeds?
- Not I, Your Highness.
- You, Sir Boron?
- Nor I, Your Highness.
- You, Sir Ralf of Durham?
- My sword is yours, Your Highness.
And what about our young
Saxon cockerel here?
What's the matter?
Have you no stomach for honest meat?
For honest meat, yes.
But I've no stomach for traitors.
- You call me traitor?
- You? Yes.
And every man here who offers you allegiance.
Your Highness.
What do you call a man who takes advantage of a king's misfortune...
...to seize his power?
And now, with the help of this sweet band of cutthroats...
...you'll try to grind a ransom for him out of every helpless Saxon.
A ransom that'll be used not to release
Richard, but to buy your way to the throne.
Let me ram those words down his throat,
Your Highness!
Oh, no. Later.
Let him spout for the moment.
And what do you propose to do?
I'll organize revolt.
Exact a death for a death.
And I'll never rest until every Saxon in this shire can stand up, free men...
...and strike a blow for Richard and England.
- Have you finished?
- I'm only just beginning.
From this night on, I use every means in my power to fight you.
Dickon!
Such impudence, Your Highness.
If I could only reach him.
Stand back!
Stand back!
Open the door!
Quick, guards, quick!
There's a traitor inside trying to escape!
- Shut the door, quick!
- Traitor, sir?
You infernal idiot!
Which way did he go?
There, through the gate.
- After him!
- Guards! Horses!
Dickon, follow Mansfield!
To your troop!
Up you go, quick.
Find Crippen the arrow-maker and his friends...
...to pass the word to every man who's been beaten or tortured:
- The Gallows Oaks in Sherwood tomorrow.
- Yes, master.
Off you go, and good luck.
Have it proclaimed in every village that this Saxon Locksley's an outlaw.
- Hang anybody that gives him shelter or aid.
- Yes, Your Highness.
His possessions are forfeit to the crown.
Seize his castle and his lands.
Everything he owns.
And just to let the people know how the wind has changed...
...the sooner you begin collecting the...
- The ransom, Your Highness?
Yes, yes, of course.
The ransom.
There's a death sentence for your Robin of Locksley!
I'll have him dangling in a week.
- I'm tired.
- What?
- After a refreshing sleep in the greenwood?
- I've pulled seven acorns out of my ribs.
- Lovely fresh air.
- My teeth ache with chattering.
- Nightingales singing.
- An owl hooting in my ear all night.
Hooting?
He was singing you to sleep.
There's a lusty infant.
He'd be a good one to reason into joining us.
By the look of him, his quarterstaff does his reasoning for him.
- Let's see what he's made of.
- It's your skull, not mine.
- Give way, little man.
- Only to a better man than myself.
He stands before you.
Let him pass, Robin. It's much too warm to brawl with such a windbag.
When I've brushed this fly off,
I'll give you a dusting for good measure.
This fly has a mighty sting, friend.
I've only a staff and you threaten me with a longbow and a goose shaft.
- Aren't you man enough...?
- Wait! I'll get myself a staff.
- Ready?
- Yes.
Hey, pretty fellow, play a livelier tune that I can make this puny rascal dance to.
You need a merrier tune?
Well, how's this?
If you want a lesson, you came to the right man!
- Where is he?
- Who?
- This quarterstaff master.
- Here.
Give my compliments to him.
My friend, I should ask payment for what I'm teaching you here today.
There's something on account.
There's your change.
My head hums like a swarm of bees.
What's your name, friend?
- John Little. What's yours?
- Robin.
- Not Robin of Locksley?
- Aye.
- Then I'm right glad I fell in with you.
- 'Twas he who did the falling in.
I wanted to see what you were made of.
And I did.
- I hope you'll not hold it against me.
- On the contrary.
- I love a man that can best me.
- I'd like to join your company.
You shall. If you can hold a breach like you held that bridge, you're one of us. Welcome.
- This is Will of Gamwell.
- Yeah.
- He took good care not to wet his feathers.
- Just brain over brawn, friend.
You heard Robin's orders.
Look nippy now and spread the word.
"By royal decree, Robin of Locksley is declared an outlaw, condemned to death."
- Meet Robin in Sherwood at Gallows Oaks.
- "Any person aiding him will be hanged."
Meet Robin in Sherwood at Gallows Oaks.
Robin in Sherwood.
At the Gallows Oak.
Robin in Sherwood.
Robin. Gallows Oak.
Gallows Oak.
I've called you here as freeborn Englishmen, loyal to our king.
While he reigned over us we lived in peace.
But since Prince John has seized the regency...
...Guy of Gisbourne and his traitors have murdered and pillaged.
You've all suffered from their cruelty.
The ear loppings, the beatings...
...the blindings with hot irons, the burning of our homes...
...the mistreatment of our women.
It's time we put an end to this!
- Robin's right.
- Aye!
Now, this forest is wide.
It can shelter, clothe and feed a band of good, determined men...
...good swordsmen, good archers, good fighters!
Men, if you're willing to fight for our people,
I want you. Are you with me?
Aye! Aye!
Then kneel and swear this oath.
That you, the freemen of this forest, swear to despoil the rich only to give to the poor.
To shelter the old and helpless, to protect all women, rich or poor, Norman or Saxon.
Swear to fight for a free England.
To protect her loyally until the return of our king and sovereign, Richard the Lion-Heart.
And swear to fight to the death against our oppressors!
We do!
We do solemnly swear!
String him up again!
- He'll die if we lash him again, my lord.
- Oh, he'll die, will he?
Another one of their Saxon impudences.
They'll do anything to trick us.
Continue!
- Mercy, good master! Have mercy!
- Start him dancing!
This will teach you to defy Prince John!
Father! Father!
Stop!
Five men dead. Murdered.
Sir lvor, Nigel, Baldwin, Norbert.
- You don't have to name them.
- Our men can't lay a hot iron...
...in the eyes of a tax dodger without getting an arrow in the throat. It's an outrage!
- He's got to be stopped!
- Have you tried to stop him?
Yes, but I couldn't find him.
What chance has anyone of finding him?
Every villager and woodcutter's his friend.
Every runaway serf and Saxon thief in the shire is joining him.
I've sent spies in the forest to find out his hiding place...
...but he strikes, and gone like a flash.
- While you stay safely at home.
Do you question my valor?
Am I not personally commanding the force...
...that goes with Sir Guy and Lady Marian to Kenworth Castle...
...to guard the tax money he is bringing back, with my sword and my life?
I only hope this murderer does come out of his hiding place.
You hope!
Enough of this wrangling! I'll lay this outlaw by the heels when I get back.
Well, well.
A curtal friar, and a mighty fat one at that.
- He's the man we need. I'll enlist him.
- Be careful, Robin.
That's the friar of Fountain's Abbey.
He's noted...
Yeah, that's right.
Noted for his piety.
A humble soul, he is, with a heart as gentle as a lamb.
- Be easy with him, master.
- Oh, I won't harm him.
You stay here lest you frighten him.
Don't interfere.
But that friar's one of the most dangerous swordsmen...
Bless my soul, a miracle!
Robber! Thief!
Give me back my mutton joint!
If you're a robber you'll get nothing from me.
I'm a curtal friar and vowed to poverty.
If this is poverty,
I'll gladly share it with you.
That's what you are doing.
Give me back my mutton joint!
Not so close, my ponderous one.
- I'd have a word with you.
- Well?
I live in the forest with good fellows who've everything in life save spiritual guidance.
And no merit but one.
- And what's that?
- We're outlaws.
Since we're newborn to the greenwood, we need someone to do our christenings.
- So we've chosen you.
- Not I.
- They've probably all got your taking ways.
- Of course. But you'll love them, one and all.
Now, friar, let's waste no more time.
We'll take the shortcut across the stream.
- Come.
- I'll not. I'm happy here.
You will come.
Now then, since I don't care to get my feet wet, you'll carry me across on your back.
- On my back?
- Bend! You must learn obedience.
Come on, bend.
On, now!
Come on! On! On! Faster!
I'll have a gallop from you yet.
Come now, fat one. Why don't you give up?
You can see I'm a better swordsman.
After I let a little air into your bellows you'll whistle a different tune.
By Our Lady, you're the fairest swordsman I ever met.
Must we go on, then?
I think we're even now, friar.
Even? Nay. You're still ahead of me by half a leg of mutton.
- So...
- No. Hold there, friar. Enough.
Come with me and I'll promise you the finest venison pasty, and the biggest you ever ate.
Beef, boar's head, casks of ale.
If you'd said that before, you'd have saved us both a wetting. Come along.
- You'll join us?
- Aye.
If only to convert you from your thieving ways.
You're Robin Hood, aren't you?
The holy henchman!
Hail, doubting friar!
- Robin.
- Aye?
He's well named Friar Tuck.
It would take half the deer in Sherwood Forest to fill that cavern.
And twice that to fill your empty head.
- Whoa, Will!
- What news, Will?
- I've got word...
- It's all right. He's one of us.
One of us?
He looks like three of us.
Aye.
And equal to a full dozen.
Now, now, now, now.
Friar Tuck, Will Scarlett. What's it, Will?
Sir Guy of Gisbourne is stopping by the way tonight.
- Has he got the tax money?
- A fortune!
- When does he enter Sherwood?
- Tomorrow.
We'll have to postpone that stuffing match
I promised, but it'll be double tomorrow!
Come! Back to camp, men!
Here, curb your appetite with that.
- Are you ready, men?
- Aye.
- See anything of them?
- Not yet.
Is everything ready?
They'll think they've got into a blooming hornet's nest.
There they come.
- Hadn't we better send out flanking guards?
- What for?
Well, this is Sherwood, you know, and Robin Hood...
- Afraid of that gallows-face?
- Afraid? Certainly not, sir.
But it's here that he's boldest.
Don't worry.
We're more than enough to take care of him.
Outlaws have no face to show themselves against armed troops.
Are you sure?
I seem to remember...
Oh, yes, he jumps out of ambush at small parties, but he wouldn't dare to attack us.
- Well, you old rooster, what do you see?
- Make ready. They're in two sections.
- Do you see Sir Guy?
- He's leading the second.
The treasure wagon is with him.
Sir Guy and the sheriff are watering their horses.
- The advance guard's far ahead.
- Good. Little John!
Take your men and cut off the first section.
You surround the advance guard.
Personally!
- Ready, men?
- Aye, Robin!
Then stand ready for the signal.
Come, Will. Come on, let's welcome Sir Guy.
- Look!
- The guard! Quick!
Welcome to Sherwood, my lady.
What, Sir Guy, no greeting from you?
Why, that's curious.
I've often heard that you'd give me a warm welcome if ever we met again.
- You're permitting this insolence without...?
- Fighting?
- I'm afraid he has no choice, my lady.
- Well, I have, you impudent rascal!
You're not going to harm my lamb, my honeysuckle.
Be still, Bess.
We've nothing but peaceful intentions.
Have we, men?
We only want to stroke his pretty neck.
- We won't harm him much.
- You see?
Well, let's away.
Don't bother to mark the way.
It'll take keener men than you've got...
...to find our camp again.
- You'll hang for this, all of you.
A small price to pay for the company of such a charming lady.
What can a Saxon hedge-robber know of charm? Or ladies?
- She means you.
- Me? A hedge-robber?
You must tell me more about myself.
You may have been misinformed.
Perhaps, but I don't find it interesting enough to bother about.
You just harm one hair of my lady's head...
...and that ugly face of yours will walk about with no neck under it. Now, mind!
- What are you staring at?
- I ain't never been out walking...
...with a female before.
- What female?
- You.
- Well, of all the impudence!
I suppose you say that to all women that tickle your fancy.
I've never tickled a woman's fancy before.
No, I've never had a sweetheart.
Do you mean to say you never had one single sweetheart in all your life?
You don't know what you missed, my lad.
I've had the bands on five times.
My lord! Your robes for the feast.
Hurry up, put them on.
- I won't!
- You will!
I will! I will!
To them, this is heaven.
Silks for rags, kindness instead of riches, limitless food instead of hunger.
- Why, they're actually happy.
- Are they?
Aren't you even a little pleased to see them enjoying themselves?
I think it's revolting.
Your life's been very sheltered, hasn't it, my lady? Too sheltered, perhaps.
But if you could know these people as I know them. Their patience, loyalty, goodness.
Friar Tuck!
These should fit Sir Guy.
Me lord. Here is your raiment for the banquet.
When you've done with them, give them to Prince John.
To the tables, everybody, and stuff yourselves!
May I serve you, my lady?
I'm afraid the company has spoiled my appetite.
Misfortune.
Now, mine is excellent.
- A little mutton, my lady?
- I said I'm not hungry.
Why, so you did. I'd forgotten.
Well, you will let me know if you regain your appetite, won't you?
Friends! Friends!
I'd supposed, with you, that this Sir Guy of Gisbourne was a scurvy fellow...
...and a bitter enemy of ours.
And yet, look!
He provides us with this tasty supper.
And is this the end of his beneficence?
Why, no!
For in his train today he's brought us half a score of boxes full of jewels and silks...
...and more, about 30,000 golden marks wrested from the northern shires.
- You wouldn't dare.
- Sit down!
Some of you might think our host intended this treasure for the coffers of Prince John...
...instead of to ransom the king.
And you would be right.
But a strange thing happened.
A change of heart overtook him in the forest, and there it is, safe and sound!
- You speak of loyalty.
- Yes. Why not?
I suppose you and your cutthroats intend to send this treasure to Richard?
You wouldn't dream of keeping it yourselves.
Friends! What shall we do with this treasure?
Divide it amongst ourselves?
- Hold it for Richard!
- It belongs to the king!
- Convinced?
- I may have been hasty...
But why you, a knight, should live here like an animal, robbing, killing, outlawed...?
Are you really interested in learning why I turned outlaw?
Or are you afraid of the truth?
Or of me, perhaps?
- I'm afraid of nothing. Least of all of you.
- Good. Then come with me.
Oh, so you are afraid.
- Well, men.
- Hi!
Hardly an inspiring sight for such pretty eyes as yours, I'm sure.
But these poor devils have all had their homes burned.
Their families beaten and starved to death by your tax gatherers.
- Bless you, Robin. We'll never forget you.
- Our humble thanks, master.
- May we be worthy, Robin.
- You are, mother, you are.
- Have you eaten well, friend?
- Yes, thank you, Robin Hood.
We humbly thank you, master.
I'm sorry to have to show you that. But once these poor people were happy and contented.
Just simple villagers who never harmed a soul.
And now... Tortured, eyes put out, tongues slit, ears hacked off.
They come to me for protection against your Norman friends.
But you've taken Norman lives.
Yes, those that deserved it.
The cruel and unjust.
You're a strange man.
Strange? Because I can feel for beaten, helpless people?
No, you're strange because you want to do something about it.
You're willing to defy Sir Guy, even Prince
John himself. To risk your own life.
- And one of those men was a Norman.
- Norman or Saxon. What's that matter?
- It's injustice I hate, not the Normans.
- But it's lost you your rank, your lands.
It's made you a hunted outlaw, when you might have lived in comfort and security.
What's your reward for all this?
Reward?
You just don't understand, do you?
I'm sorry.
I do begin to see a little now.
If you do, then that's reward enough.
Now that you've robbed us and had your fill of insulting us, we wish to leave.
- Come, Lady Marian.
- My men will escort my lady.
But before you take leave, it might be well if you thanked her for saving your life.
My life?
Do you think you would have left this forest alive if it hadn't been for her presence here?
- Peter! Harold!
- Yes, master?
Take six men and guide our loyal host and his nervous friend to the Nottingham Road.
But our horses, our clothes.
You'll return to Nottingham as you are, on foot.
This, Sir Guy, will at least be a lesson to you in humility, if not in mercy.
- Your people will be returned tomorrow.
- But the lady Marian.
You'd best be started before I have a change of mind.
I think we'd better go.
Now, my lady.
Friar Tuck! Little John!
Take the lady to the Abbey of the Black Canons...
...so tomorrow the bishop can give her escort the rest of the way.
- May I go too?
- With your permission, my lady?
Goodbye, my lady.
Goodbye.
- He took everything you had collected?
- Every silver penny.
And you two nincompoops sat there and let him do it.
- Oh, we resisted as well as we could.
- Where are your wounds? Your bruises?
- And where are your men?
- What did Your Highness expect?
With the Lady Marian in our company and Locksley's men outnumbering us.
And not an arrow wound to divide among them, I suppose.
And more than 30,000 marks in the hands of that wolf's head.
That fellow's got to be taken.
Understand?
And how does Your Highness suggest that he be taken?
- lf I may be so bold as to inquire?
- Mind your words, Gisbourne.
You're fortunate not to be paying for this with your head.
Your Highness, sir, I could muster an army and surround Sherwood.
- You couldn't capture him...
- You mind your words.
...if he sat in your lap shooting arrows at a crow.
Arrows!
- He said shooting arrows at a crow.
- Take that silly looking bonnet off.
That stirs something in my mind.
Perhaps we can't take him by force.
He's too well protected.
Knows Sherwood's hidden paths well. But...
- But what?
- We'll outwit him.
We'll hold an archery tournament!
Archery tour...
And have him fly in on the end of one of his own arrows? That's marvelous.
He's the finest archer in the North.
Think he'd forgo shooting...
...against the archers of all England?
We'll give a prize. Say, a golden arrow.
And ask him to risk his neck for that?
That won't be the only bait, with the Lady Marian presenting the arrow herself.
What do you mean?
When they came out of the forest, she seemed very friendly.
And didn't you notice how his eyes never left her?
- Yes, yes, I noticed.
- Well, then!
- Well, then, how do we get word to him?
- Get word to Robin...
...who has an eye in every bush and ears in every wall?
But even if he comes, won't he be disguised?
Whether he be dressed as priest, beggar, knight, palmer, what disguise can conceal...
...the finest archer in England?
The man who wins the golden arrow will be Robin Hood.
Will you take that bonnet off?
I hope our little golden hook will catch the fish.
- You hope?
- Oh, it will if he's here.
If he's not, we'll stick your head upon the target and shoot at that.
- Are your men sure of their orders?
- Yes.
They're stationed all around the field.
Even a worm couldn't get through.
You talk as if this were a trap.
Oh, no, my dear. Just a precaution in case the Saxons create a disturbance.
By orders of His Highness Prince John, the champions of Sir Guy and the knights...
...will be limited to three flights of arrows for the eliminations.
The winning team will meet all comers.
- You know it's a trap.
- A golden arrow, from the lady herself.
- They've cooked up this thing to take you.
- Well, what of it?
- You know what'll happen if they do.
- Where's your sporting blood?
Sir Guy accepted our invitation.
We'd be rude not to accept his.
- It'd be ruder to get your neck stretched.
- There, my band getting fat and overfed.
Where's your love of fights, risk, adventure?
Well, since our friend seems to have gone a little mad, I'll have to see him through.
We'll have to see him through.
Prepare final flight.
Does my lady find it interesting?
Lady Marian?
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- I asked if you found it interesting.
Yes, very.
They're splendid archers.
You'll find it much more interesting later on.
The winning team will compete as individuals.
Captain Phillip of Arras.
Elwyn the Welshman.
Matt of Sleaford.
They now challenge all comers.
The men who'd shoot against that lot have to have the eyes of a falcon.
They're far too good for me.
I'm not shooting today.
Remaining archers will use center target.
Matt of Sleaford, out!
Elwyn the Welshman, out!
- The tall tinker.
- Now is the time.
Not so hasty, Sir Guy. I'm enjoying myself.
Let them finish the match.
- But he could...
- Have your men close in if you wish.
Look.
Yeah, they're closing in.
I hope Robin sees them.
I must commend Your Highness for the subtlety of your scheme.
Very good. Would you say you'd seen that tall fellow before?
And if I had, what interest could a tinker have for me?
Phillip of Arras shoots next.
Tie!
You will be allowed another flight.
Target's a deal too close. Can we have it removed to a fit distance to shoot at?
Another 20 paces!
If your archer captain wins at that distance,
I'll give you 1000 gold marks for him.
Win or lose, I'll give him to Your Highness for a favor.
Provided you let me deal with this wolf's head in my own way.
Done. I'm leaving for Norwich immediately after the tournament anyway...
...so you may do what you please with him.
Why, he can't win now.
No living man could beat that shot.
I'll wager 100 marks on Phillip of Arras!
He split Phillip's arrow.
The tinker wins! He wins!
- What is your name, archer?
- Godfrey of Sherwood, Your Highness.
How is it that a tinker learned so well the use of arms?
Even a peaceful tinker must protect himself these days from treachery and other things.
It's earned you more than you bargained for today.
I pronounce you champion archer of England.
And from the gracious hand of Lady Marian
Fitzwalter, you'll receive your reward.
Advance.
I... Here is your prize, sir archer.
It's indeed an honor to receive it from the hands of so beautiful a lady.
- How is it that you didn't use a black arrow?
- That's my court of last resort, Sir Guy.
- Its verdict is always final.
- Arrest this man!
That's a good idea.
You're a very rash young man.
And I'm sorry I can't be in Nottingham to see what Gisbourne has in store for you.
- It'll be something special, I'm sure.
- I'm sure.
Sorry I underestimated you.
Next time perhaps...
There'll be no next time.
Take him away!
"Robin of Locksley.
Known to some as the outlaw Robin Hood.
After trial, in which you did not produce one witness in your behalf...
...you've been found guilty of outlawry, theft, murder, abduction...
...false pretenses, contempt of the Crown, poaching in royal forests and high treason."
Haven't you forgotten a count or two?
Surely it's a crime under the noble
Prince John to love one's country.
To protect serfs from injustice and be loyal to one's king.
If I could add anything to the charges against you, I would most gladly do so.
"It is the sentence of this tribunal, on the morrow at high noon you be taken...
...to the square in Nottingham and there hanged by the neck until you are dead."
There may be some who will regret that a man of your peculiar talents...
...should be cut off so early in life.
But personally...
You think the sentence extremely lenient.
Thank you.
What's troubling you, my lady?
Is it the outlaw?
Yes. I hate to see a human being trapped...
Bess, you know where his men may be found, don't you?
- Why, my lady, how should I know?
- Don't put me off.
That little man who liked you.
You've been seeing him?
- Yes, my lady.
- Tell me where.
- Do you want to send a message?
- To his men, yes.
Well, my lady, I have had a nip of ale of a night, just now and again...
...at a place in the town and I won't deny as some of the others were there.
Where was it?
Oh, Bess, please tell me!
It was a tavern, my lady.
The Saracen's Head in Pilgrim Court.
- The landlord's name is Humility Prin.
- Humility Prin.
- Knock at the door and say, "A Locksley."
- "A Locksley."
- Yes, but...
- Get me a cloak, quickly!
Yes, madame.
Oh, dear...
- But there must be some way...
- lf we had to, couldn't we storm the place?
Why, you'd need an army with a battering ram to even dent it.
Aye, he'll be hanged for sure.
Maybe Little John's right.
Perhaps we should...
A Locksley.
- What is it, Prin?
- A lady, sir. The Lady Marian.
- What?
- It's a trap, Will. Watch those windows.
She has the password, all right.
- Is she alone?
- Yes, sir.
Fetch her in.
- What do you want, my lady?
- I want to help him.
- How did you find us here?
- Never mind that now.
Please don't stand there staring.
Tell me what I can do.
- Don't trust her. It's a Norman trick.
- Would I come here alone if it were a trap?
What's to prevent your killing me if...? Is there no one here with sense enough to see?
One moment.
We have to make sure, my child.
You're a good daughter of the church?
You swear by Our Lady that you want to help Robin?
I swear, good Father.
- Have you thought of a way?
- Yes.
- Can you get us in the castle?
- That's no good. He's heavily guarded.
But I thought of another way.
Listen.
- This is a rare treat, isn't it, my lady?
- Yes, isn't it?
With Locksley out of the way, we'll stamp out the rest.
Won't it be a pleasant surprise for Prince John when he returns?
And to think that I was once foolish enough to believe that you rather liked him.
Why, your hand is trembling.
Take him to the gallows.
Take him up there.
He'll not be so insolent when they've stretched his neck.
Get ready.
Stop him!
Stop! Guards!
Friar Tuck! Much!
- Here we are, sir!
- Here we are, safe and sound!
Back to camp!
Robin! Where are you?
Here I am. Stand by!
He is different from anyone I've ever known.
He's, well, he's brave and he's reckless, and yet he's gentle and kind.
He's not brutal like...
Tell me, when you are in love, is it...
...well, is it hard to think of anybody but one person?
Yes, indeed, and sometimes there's a bit of trouble sleeping.
I know, but it's a nice kind of not sleeping.
Yes, and it affects your appetite too.
Not that I've noticed it's done that to you, except when he was waiting to be hanged.
Does it make you want to be with him all the time?
Yes. And when he's with you, your legs are weak as water.
Tell me, my lady, when he looks at you, do you feel a kind of prickly feeling...
...like goosy pimples running all up and down your spine?
- Then there's not a doubt of it.
- Doubt of what?
That you're in love!
What do you want?
Robin!
- I must say. I must say!
- Keep quiet, Bess.
Are you completely mad?
- Why did you come here?
- To see you.
But don't you realize that...?
My men told me what you did for me, so I've come to thank you.
And after what I couldn't help overhearing about that prickly feeling...
...I'm very glad I did come.
That was a game.
Now, you've got to go at once!
A game?
Well, couldn't I join in?
Of course, I probably wouldn't be as good at it as this pretty young girl.
But I could do my best.
Bess, will you leave us?
Please!
Now, let's see, where does this game begin?
Oh, I know. It's simple.
We'll start where you're in love with me.
You are, aren't you?
Because I am with you, terribly.
That's why I came.
I had to see you again.
You must go at once.
And I don't love you.
- Oh! Are you sure?
- Yes.
Very well then, I'll go.
You know, this is rather unfriendly of you, exposing me to my enemies like this.
Now, let me see. There's a fat old captain of the guard down there with bow legs.
If I drop on him that'll bend them out worse.
An archer! He's too thin.
I might miss him altogether.
- Robin!
- The very thing.
Five men-at-arms in a group.
They'll break the fall beautifully.
- Goodbye, my lady!
- Robin!
- Yes?
- Please.
Then you do love me? Don't you?
- Don't you?
- You know I do.
Well, that's different.
- Do you know you're very impudent?
- Me?
You are!
When my guardian, King Richard, finds out about your being in love with me...
- I know, he'll make me court jester.
- He won't!
He'll stick your funny head on London Gate.
And a fine decoration it will be, my bold Norman beauty.
- I'm not bold.
- Well, you're Norman.
Well, I don't hold that against you.
And you are a beauty.
- You're the most beautiful...
- You're leaving at once.
Please, darling, every minute you're here you're in danger.
I'll go.
- Marian, will you come with me?
- To Sherwood?
I've nothing to offer you but a life of hardship and danger, but we'd be together.
- But, Robin, dear...
- I know. It's asking a lot, but who knows...
...how long it'll be before Richard returns.
Friar Tuck could marry us. Will you?
Because I love you, Robin, I'd come.
Even the danger would mean nothing if you were with me.
Then you will?
No. Listen to me, darling.
You remember that day in Sherwood Forest?
I realized then for the first time that what you were doing was right...
...and that we were wrong.
No, let me finish.
You taught me England is bigger than Normans and Saxons...
...fighting and hating each other.
That it belongs to all of us, to live peacefully together...
...loyal only to Richard and to England.
But, darling, you could help.
I could help much more by watching for treachery here...
...and leaving you free to protect
Richard's people until he returns.
Now do you see why you have to go back to your men alone?
Go now, quickly, dearest.
- Goodbye, darling.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, my love.
- Goodbye.
- You gentlemen have traveled far?
- Yes, quite a distance.
I'm sorry I can't give you better food.
- There is little left to us these days.
- This will be enough.
The inn at Luton was well supplied.
How is that?
That's a Norman inn.
But it's an outrage!
I'll complain to Prince John.
I'll have this rascal's ears, no matter how.
Dares to rob me!
Strip my person of jewels!
What's this country coming to when a high churchman can't travel the forest in safety?
- Who's he?
- The Bishop of the Black Canons.
- Do you wish to go on after dinner?
- No. We can't reach the abbey tonight.
- I'll stay. Tend to the horses.
- Yes, Your Grace.
- Bring food to us!
- Yes, Your Grace, at once!
It's no longer safe to journey anywhere.
Robbers at every turn of the road.
- What happened, Your Grace?
- I told you! We've been robbed.
Not a chance to defend ourselves.
They burst on us from ambush.
- Who did?
- Why, Robin Hood, of course.
There's no other with impudence enough.
Robin Hood again, sire.
- You've heard of him, then?
- Oh, he seems well known hereabouts.
- Oh, then you're strange to this shire?
- More or less.
What might be your names, gentlemen?
They're hardly important enough to deserve your interest.
- Landlord, where's our ale?
- Coming, sirs.
Will you gentlemen be remaining here tonight?
We hadn't decided, Your Grace.
What would you advise?
Well, there's so much danger on the road, you'd be far safer here.
We will then, since we'll have the added pleasure of your company.
Well, I should really like to stay, but I recollected some urgent affairs at my abbey.
Some other time, or perhaps you would break your journey and sup with me tomorrow.
Your Grace is too kind.
Then I bid you good evening, gentlemen, and God speed you in the morning.
Thank you. Good night.
The window!
Are there beds prepared, landlord?
Let's to sleep, then. I'm tired.
- I'm afraid he suspects, sire.
- I fear so.
His Grace is a Norman. Did you see the fear on the landlord's face when he came in?
I've seen it in the faces of thousands since we returned.
I ought never to have left England.
I noticed when Robin Hood's name is mentioned...
The mysterious outlaw whom we have sought.
In vain. However, the bishop didn't have any difficulty meeting him.
Which gives me an idea.
- And you're sure it was Richard?
- No doubt of it.
How like my dear brother this is!
He couldn't rot in Durnstein like any decent man.
- But Richard has no army.
- No, Your Highness.
- lf he had, we should have heard of it.
- lf my brother happened to be killed...
- England would have a new king.
- That would be murder! I'll have no part...
You'll do as you're told!
That's very simple. Keep your mouth closed.
Your Highness, I beg of you!
How long will you retain your abbey if Richard survives to find out...
...what you've been up to these years he's been away?
Go on, Gisbourne. Who's to...?
Dickon was a knight before your brother hacked off his spurs...
...over some little mischance.
There's nothing he wouldn't do for a king who'd restore him to rank.
- You don't love my brother, I hear.
- I have little reason to, Your Highness.
- You know this tavern?
- Yes.
- lf Richard dies...
- Dickon returns to the roll of English knights.
Am I not right?
With the manor and estate of Robin of Locksley to support his rank.
- When shall I start?
- Immediately. How many men will you need?
I shall do it better alone, Your Highness.
The sooner you're crowned king...
The better for my friends?
You're a clever fellow, Gisbourne.
Thank you, Your Majesty.
Return to your abbey and make preparations to proclaim me king...
...here in Nottingham, the day after tomorrow.
Do you suppose she heard?
I don't know.
And now you know why Robin's got to find
King Richard at once and warn him.
Take this note to Much at Saracen's Head.
My lady's hearing is a little defective tonight.
When you knock at a lady's door as if it were a tavern, you deserve to wait.
You seem upset.
Upset? Why should I be?
Oh, come now, my dear Lady Marian.
You've played the innocent long enough.
- Let's be frank with one another.
- I don't see the need.
You're charming, Lady Marian, but not exactly clever. You couldn't have failed...
...to overhear what Prince John and I were talking about.
Oh, no, no, no.
Please don't trouble to deny it.
And your first thought, as Richard's loyal ward, was to warn him.
- Am I not right?
- Why, how could I warn Richard?
How did Locksley and his men arrange his escape...
...from hanging after the archery match?
Someone here in the castle must have got word to him.
That's ridiculous!
When Richard's in danger, what more natural...
...than that you should try to warn him through Locksley?
And you do intend to warn him, don't you?
- Don't you?
- No!
If that's true, perhaps you'd explain before Prince John...
...and the Court of Execution the meaning of this.
Guard!
Escort my Lady Marian to the Great Hall.
Not only has she consorted with this Saxon rebel...
...found guilty of outlawry, theft, murder, abduction and high treason...
...but she has betrayed her own Norman people.
Are you not ashamed, my Lady Marian?
Yes, I am. Bitterly. But it's a shame that I'm a Norman...
...after seeing the things my fellow countrymen have done to England.
At first I wouldn't believe. Because I was a Norman I wouldn't let myself believe...
...that the horrors you inflicted on the Saxons weren't just.
I know now why you tried so hard to kill this outlaw whom you despised.
It's because he was the one man in England who protected the helpless...
...against beasts who were drunk on human blood!
And now you intend to murder your own brother!
You'll be sorry you interfered.
Sorry? I'd do it again if you kill me for it.
A prophetic speech, my lady, for that is exactly what is going to happen to you.
You wouldn't dare.
I'm the royal ward of King Richard and no one but the king himself...
...has the right to condemn me to death.
You are quite right, my dear.
And it shall be a king who will order your execution for high treason...
...exactly 48 hours from now.
Take her away.
- Have you got it all in your stupid head now?
- Of course I have.
Well, give Robin the whole message exactly like I told it to you.
Bess, where was Dickon supposed to find King Richard?
Oh, never mind him!
What do I care about your kings and thrones and such?
Robin has gotta do something to save my baby!
Come on, old girl.
Robin will look after her, all right.
- Where's Dickon heading for?
- Kent Road Tavern.
Kent Road Tavern? You can save three miles and cut him off through Low Wood.
Come on, lass, give us a kiss and wish me luck.
Hurry up and take your ugly face out of here.
Oh, Much.
Oh, you will be careful, won't you?
Of course I will.
Greetings, sir abbot!
- You've traveled far this morning?
- Too far to be patient with delay now.
Perhaps it's the weight of your purse that wearies you. Now, I can remedy that.
If it weighs more than a just amount
I'll share it with those who have less. Come.
You think I hand my purse to every rough lout who asks for it?
You see, sir abbot?
We're poor outlaws, with nothing to eat but the king's deer...
...while you have property, rents, and silver. So your purse!
I've traveled far on the king's business and the silver I have left...
...equals no more than 60 marks.
What?
Are you friendly to our good King Richard?
I love no man better.
By that speech you save half your money.
Give me 30 marks for the poor and the rest you may keep.
Then I can go free?
Any friend of Richard's is free of this forest.
Would you honor us by sharing meat with us?
- Gladly.
- Then come.
- Well, sir rascal, tell me, who are you?
- I'm called Robin Hood.
It seems I've heard of you.
- Nothing good, I hope.
- Oh, now I remember!
How does your loyalty to Richard set on a killer of knights...
...a poacher of the king's deer and an outlaw?
Those I kill died from misusing the trust that Richard left them.
And the worst rogue of these is the king's own brother.
- Oh, then you blame Prince John.
- No, I blame Richard.
His task was defending his people instead of deserting them to fight in foreign lands.
What?
You'd condemn Holy Crusades?
I'll condemn anything that leaves the task of holding England to outlaws like me.
Much!
- Much, what's happened to you?
- Take me to Robin, quick!
- Much, what's happened?
- King Richard's in England. In Sherwood!
What?
Prince John sent Dickon to Kent Road Tavern last night to kill the king.
- Will, take 50 men to the Kent Road Tavern...
- No need, master, no need.
I headed Dickon off.
He ain't gonna murder no one no more.
- But the king? Where is he?
- I don't know, master.
Men, Richard must be found.
He must be brought here for safety.
Little John, take a party and scour the country.
Friar Tuck, into the town.
Will, search every inn and cottage.
Don't rest, day or night, until he's found. Understand?
You don't need to search for Richard, Robin.
- He's in good hands. The best in England.
- What do you mean? Where is he?
Here!
Sire.
All these have remained loyal.
Rise, Sir Robin.
Rise, men of Sherwood.
Sire, Prince John's calling
Bishop of the Black Canons...
...to proclaim him king in Nottingham tomorrow.
- How'd you learn this?
- Lady Marian. She overheard.
They've taken her for treason.
She's been condemned to the block for warning us.
He wouldn't dare execute the king's ward.
You underestimate him. If we're to save her and your throne, we've got to act now!
By attacking Nottingham castle?
Without an army it'll be much too strong.
Your men will be killed.
If the Bishop of the Black Canons is performing the ceremony tomorrow...
...suppose we visit him at his abbey tonight and persuade him to suggest a way.
Brace up. Smile!
Wider!
Still sure it wasn't you who warned my brother I was in England?
Why, sire, believe me, I...
Your Grace, smile!
You'll sweat the lard off that fat carcass of yours...
...before this day's over, my pudgy friend.
And I hope some Norman sword whittles you down to size!
Oh, Lord, we beseech thee.
Sanctify this thy servant, our royal Prince John.
Enrich his noble heart and bestow upon him all princely virtues.
Amen.
No news of Richard.
No. None, Your Highness.
Then Dickon must have...
Sir Dickon, Your Highness.
Of course. Of course.
We are ready for the ceremony,
Your Majesty.
Remember.
By what authority do you,
John Lackland, Prince of England...
...claim to be crowned this day, sovereign of the realm...
...and as defender of the Holy Sepulcher, to receive the blessing of the church?
By right of blood succession.
According to the law of the realm.
Is it of your own free will that you thus depose your brother...
...Richard the Lion-Heart of England?
Richard no longer exists!
From this moment forward,
I, John, am king of England!
Aren't you a little premature, brother?
Richard! The Lion-Heart!
He's lying! He's an imposter!
- The king lives!
- Men of Sherwood!
Robin Hood!
It's a trick of the outlaws!
Kill him! Seize him!
- Did I upset your plans?
- You've come to Nottingham once too often!
When this is over, there'll be no need for me to come again.
Your sword, Gisbourne.
- Know any prayers, my friend?
- I'll say one for you!
Save yourself, Robin!
The door, quick!
Quick, or I'll trim that beard for you!
But, Richard, Richard! I thought...
- You thought I was murdered!
- Oh, no, no.
I didn't mean to...
After all, Richard, I am your brother.
Yes, sire, he is your brother.
Yes, my brother.
I could forgive you if your treachery were against me and not my subjects.
I banish you and your followers from England for the remainder of my lifetime.
Take them away.
See that they leave England.
I further banish from my realm all injustices and oppressions...
...which have burdened my people.
And I pray that under my rule...
...Normans and Saxons alike will share the rights of Englishmen.
Long live Richard the Lion-Heart!
What about you, Robin?
My sword is yours, sire, now and always.
Is there nothing the king can grant the outlaw...
...who showed him his duty to his country?
Yes, Your Majesty, a pardon for the men of Sherwood.
Granted with all my heart.
Long live Richard the Lion-Heart!
But is there nothing for yourself?
There's but one thing else, sire.
And do you too wish...?
More than anything in the world, sire.
Kneel, Robin Hood.
Arise, Robin, Baron of Locksley,
Earl of Sherwood and Nottingham...
...and lord of all the lands and manors appertaining thereto.
My first command to you, my lord earl...
...is to take in marriage the hand of the Lady Marian.
Long live Robin Hood!
Long live Robin Hood!
Long live Lady Marian!
And what say you to that,
Baron of Locksley?
May I obey all your commands with equal pleasure, sire!
All right, gents, that's it.
At ease.
- Glad to see you aboard, Cobb.
- Thank you, sir.
- Take charge of number one section up forward.
- Aye, sir.
- Glad to see you aboard, Costello.
- I'm glad to be aboard, Captain.
I was with your father in the Philippines.
I'll never forget the night-
Yes, I remember quite well.
He told me about it, Costello.
In fact, I read it in his memoirs.
Now, men... we've got a tough job in front of us.
We're headed for the submarine zone.
May seem strange to you men to be going on such a mission in a vessel like this.
This boat is known as a mystery ship.
Some people call it Q-boat.
We're acting as a decoy.
Our main object is to sail out there and be torpedoed by enemy U-boats.
Are there any questions to be asked?
Captain, don't we get a chance to put in a lick for ourselves?
Plenty of chance, Costello.
- Mr. MacGregor, stand ready with that forward hatch.
- Very well, sir.
Gun crew, fall out.
Follow Mr. MacGregor.
All right, stand by that lanyard.
Ready? Drop it!
Come on, drop it! Hurry up!
- It's a beauty!
- Oh, baby!
Take your dirty hands off of there!
That's as pretty a gun as I've looked at in years.
There is a Santa Claus after all.
I'm 20 years in the navy, and I don't think
I've ever looked at a sweeter rifle than that.
Turn it around there, Doggy.
They'll listen when this lady speaks.
Margolis, you'll be a busy man cleaning the brass work on this girl.
- And, Captain-
- Go ahead, Guns.
With your permission, and in honor of this day...
I'd like to christen this gun in honor of the only girl I ever loved that I know loved me-
Judy Ann McCarthy.
- Permission granted.
- You're okay, baby.
- Keep your hand off of Judy’s breech!
What do you think of her, Guns?
It's a proud man I am this day to be in charge of a gun like this.
Captain, I beg your pardon. I'm beginning to understand this mystery ship business.
Are we looking for just any U-boat, or some particular U-boat?
The biggest of them all, Cobb.
It's Baron von Steuben, the ace of the U-boat captains.
I understand, sir.
He's the skipper of U172.
He's done more to hurt the Allies than any six outfits put together.
Been sinking everything in sight... off the coast of Gibraltar in Spain- that's where we're headed.
With-With just this to hunt him?
Mr. Cobb,
I'll ask you to stop insulting my gun.
Mr. MacGregor, arrange contact with Captain Day.
- Have him come to surface immediately.
- Very well, sir.
All right, fall out, you men.
Stand by your stations.
Get this gun covered up, Costello.
Have your deckhouse in shape.
I told you there was nothing screwy about this ship!
Steady! Steady now, Doggy!
- And keep your dirty hands off of that gun!
- Yes, sir!
Hello? Let me speak to Captain Day, please.
Hello, Captain Day?
This is MacGregor speaking.
Captain Kingsley wishes you to come to the surface right away. Very well, sir.
- Sir, who were you talking to?
- To the submarine we have in tow.
Can't understand it.
Could I get Flatbush 4442?
Hello, Jacobs!
I thought you was in jail!
- When did you get on that thing?
- I don't know. They put me here.
- Glad to see you.
- Glad to see you too.
Captain Day, meet our executive officer,
Mr. MacGregor.
- Hi, Captain. Nice to see you.
- How do you do?
- Tommy, old boy! Gee, I'm glad to see ya!
- Capt. Day, Ensign Cabot.
- Sort of a sailing master around here.
- Glad to meet you.
Very glad to know you, sir.
Thank you.
- Bring him up promptly, Skipper?
- Certainly will.
- How's she heading, Tony?
- She rides fine.
- Captain!
- What is it, Elmer?
- Can I take a picture of you and the-
- No!
- Yes, sir.
- Don't say that, Elmer.
- Say aye, aye, sir.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- How's that towline heading?
- Perfect. You might give me 50 feet more.
- Request granted.
- Captain, how are the telephones working?
- Okay. Okay.
- Glad to hear it.
We'll cruise on top a while, then cast off.
Four or five days, we'll duck you under.
- Good luck.
- See you later, Tommy, old boy.
Stand by your lines!
Come on, gang!
Let's give 'em a yell, huh?
Up! Up! Up! Up!
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
Tonight's the night!
Tonight's the night!
All right, all you men! Lean forward!
On the double now! Step on it. Get going, sailor.
All hands lay up for the tag drill!
Come on, Kaufman!
Duty calls! Come on!
Quiet now. Step lively.
Snap into it down there.
Snap into it.
I watched you boys in your physical drill this morning.
I'm very proud of you.
I like that spirit you're showing.
I think it's done me a lot of good already,
Captain. Look.
Yes, it has.
Keep it up, Tommy.
Now, men, I'm going to instruct you in the panic drill.
Panic drill?
I've been in the navy a long time, but I never heard of a panic drill.
It's not in the regulations, Cobb.
We're going into the submarine zone disguised as a merchant schooner.
But what if we're torpedoed, sir?
In the hold of this ship is a load of railroad ties and cork.
Anyway,
U-boats don't waste torpedoes.
They come to the surface and try and sink tubs like this with gunfire.
Everybody goes haywire and abandons ship.
- You're the lads that go haywire.
- Oh, I see.
The idea is to make the enemy think we're harmless so she'll come in closer.
That's it exactly.
Men, I want you to remember this.
Act like a merchant crew, not navy men.
You mean, to run around the decks like we're scared, sir? Frightened?
Yeah, like a lot of chickens with your heads cut off.
And furthermore, if you don't put on a good show... the U-boat'll lie off there and blow you to pieces.
- Oh, we'll do our part, sir.
- Yes, sir!
That's the stuff.
Now, have any of you boys ever had any amateur theatrical experience?
Thurston has, sir!
What plays have you been in,
Thurston?
East Lynne.
Last year we played
Bertha, the Sewing Machine Girl.
Uh, what did you play in The Sewing Machine Girl?
I played Bertha.
All right, Thurston, you play the captain's wife in the first panic party.
All right, you men, report to Mr. Cabot, get up in the shrouds.
- Look over that water. It'll do you good now.
All right, you men!
Come on! Make it lively!
All right, Mr. Cabot, come down, take over the lads.
All right, boys, let's go along.
Come on!
Up you go, and set your topsails!
Hey, you boots. Come over here.
Come on, snap it up.
Snap it up. Step lively there.
Where did you guys learn to do that?
Why, we're from seaport towns, sir.
We know a lot about boats.
The fact is, some of our boys were on that crew... belonging to the last cup defenders.
Gee, I couldn't do that meself!
Mr. Costello, after the war is over and we come back... we hope we're sailor men like you.
I hope you are, boys.
The country'll be safe.
Don't you think the boys up there are doing very well?
Well, they're doing well as boys.
But not as they did in my day.
In my day, we had no ladders.
I've seen meself "lepp" off the roof of a wheelhouse like that... halfway up the mast.
For years I was known... as Lepper Costello.
Well, Mr. Costello, would you give us an idea of how you did it?
Oh, no. I'm too busy now.
Margolis!
Clean off that breech block!
- Aw, please!
- Just show us the start.
Well, I'll give ya an idea of the start.
Course, I'll be a bit stiff.
Climbing a ladder is nothing.
Sure, monkeys can do that.
But when I was a lad we'd come down to the deck in the morning like this-
And set yourself here.
And there's your mast.
Watch me now.
Hoo-whee! And up!
Gee!
- There he is!
- There I am!
Watch me now, boys!
And you'll notice every move in me as graceful as a gazelle.
- Get the boat!
Right down here.
Stand by! All right, get hold of him there.
Nice work, Cabot!
- Attaboy!
That's great! That's fine, baby!
- Get a line there!
- Get a line in there!
All right, stand by now!
Oh, dear! Oh, dear!
You all right?
- Careful!
Are you all right?
Give him a hand.
Pull up that lifeline.
- How are you, laddie?
- I'm fine.
Cabot, I'm glad to have you aboard.
- You're gonna make a fine officer.
- Thank you, sir.
Where's that channel swimmer?
- Congratulations, Cabot. You were fine.
- Thanks very much.
Pardon me, Mr. Cabot.
We're all very proud of you too, sir.
- And I'm glad to be serving under you.
- Thank you very much, Chief.
- Kaufman!
- Yes, sir!
Get a drink of brandy!
Aye, aye, sir.
Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear!
Let go of me pants!
You'll have me half naked!
Oh, dear, oh, dear. Why didn't you throw me a boat when I asked you for it?
- I thought you could swim!
- Who says I can't swim?
- What were you hollerin' for us to throw you a rope for?
I was tryin' to fool the lads to see if any of them were man enough... to "lepp" over after me.
And now, me lad, there's your first lesson in seamanship... from Shark Costello.
Oh, dear.
Gee, Guns Costello falls off the boat... and the captain commands me to get a drink.
I can't understand it.
Another one?
- Did you send for us, Captain?
- Yes, Cobb, yes.
We're approaching the Canary Islands.
Gonna put in to one of those banana ports there.
London tells us it's headquarters for enemy U-boats- refueling and so forth.
We're gonna pick up provisions... oil and water for this tub we got in tow.
Pardon me, gentlemen.
Do you think a fella could get tattooed in this port?
Anything is liable to happen to you in this port.
Show him yours.
Listen, fellas.
"Death before dishonor."
That's a noble sentiment.
Say, that is "purty," ain't it?
"Death before dishonor."
Yeah. I never thought of it that way.
All right, sons... there will be a liberty party formed to go ashore here.
The captain's orders are, no drinking of hard liquor.
- Of course not, Mr. Cobb.
And no fraternizing with women!
Understand, mugs?
No fraternizing with women!
No fraternizin' with women?
I never done a thing like that in my life.
- Terrific idea, boys!
- Yeah!
Simpatico.
Un momento, caballero.
I'm very sorry.
I don't understand a thing you say.
I'm just a visitor here, you see.
No, caballero.
Don't worry. I'll straighten it out all right. Just relax.
Oh, I understand. You want your picture taken. Well, that's fine. Smile.
- No, no, no, no.
- Pardon the interruption.
He's trying to explain to you you're not supposed to take any photographs out here.
Oh. I'm very sorry.
See, I didn't understand.
I'm awfully sorry.
I wonder why he was kicking about me photographing that old tub out there.
Well, you see, those boats were sunk out there by the German submarines.
- U-boats?
- Yes.
- And there's some law against photographing them.
- Oh?
Is there any law against photographing you?
No.
But why should you want to take a photograph of me?
Sailors like me that sort of bump around the world-
As a matter of fact, it's a hobby of mine... to photograph the most beautiful thing
I see in every port.
- You don't mind, do you?
Of course. I knew you wouldn't.
- No.
That's fine.
Now, just move a little that way.
Oh, this'll be perfect.
Un momento, caballero.
I'm sorry.
I'm only photographing the lady.
- Oh.
- Fine. You take us both.
- Fine, now. Press that right there.
- That's fine. Isn't that nice of him?
- ¿Listo?
- Uh-huh.
- Thank you. That's very nice.
- Gracias, señor.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
If you give me your address,
I'll send you a dozen prints or so.
Well-
You know, we haven't really met yet.
You misunderstood me. I didn't say
I'd bring them. I said I'd send them.
- Captain!
I think that's gonna be a very pretty picture.
I hope it turns out all right.
So do I.
Elmer, I want to see the negatives when they're developed.
Aye, aye, sir!
Very splendid chap.
Upstanding fellow.
Be a great sailor someday... I hope.
Hoffman.
Remember,
I'm to see you later on the prado.
- Yes?
- Yes. I'll be walking up and down the prado.
- When?
- Well, until you come out.
Well, uh, maybe I'll be walking along the prado a little later, Mr. -
Bob.
Cognac?
Anna Marie!
- Franz!
- Leibling.
- Fräulein.
I don't want to worry those boys unnecessarily.
- Do you mind if we speak English?
- No. But why? Is there anything wrong?
No. But that sailing ship that came in last night-
H-7 reports that she's an American.
- American? After us?
- Who knows?
- But they wouldn't dare come in here.
- Don't we dare?
- Oh, yes, but-
- But we're braver, eh?
We mustn't flatter ourselves.
Oh, I can't believe-
- You can't believe what?
- Nothing.
Oh, Franz, when I think of the danger that you face out there-
- Don't worry about me. My life's charmed.
It's your brother Ernst and the rest of my pals out there that I worry about.
Them and you. You shouldn't be coming out with us today on that trawler.
- How else can I see Ernst?
- I know. He's in command, and he can't leave his ship.
- The risk is too great.
- Oh, yes, I know, but I must see him.
Meine herren.
- Fräulein.
Good-bye, dear.
I'll see you tonight on the trawler... if you insist on coming to the rendezvous.
I wish to heaven you were home again, safe in Germany.
Safe, but useless.
You see, I can serve you and Ernst better this way.
They'd never suspect a woman.
Auf Wiedersehen.
Congratulations on your past service,
Fräulein Lolita.
- Thank you.
- You have your orders.
- You understand them?
Perfectly.
With these American officers, you must be very careful.
I'm always careful with all officers.
Fräulein.
- Adios.
- Auf Wiedersehen, mein fräulein.
It was in Algeciras
That I met my first love
Alas, what a short and sad love
He died in his boots at sea, ahh
Then came a bold mate
From a port called Vigo
He called every stranger amigo
And drowned all his cares with rum, ahh
Last came a skipper
From gay Barcelona
Strangled was he
By a strand of blond hair
So
Now that I'm free and filled with an eager yearning
For one who is bold
A lover with passion burning
Where is the man
That will dare fortune's losses
He must be brave
Who will win a Gypsy's kisses
You ain't even been here before!
I don't understand it!
He ain't even Spanish.
You forgot your shawl.
Mm-hmm.
Give it to me, and come in.
- Are you sure it's all right?
- Naturally.
- Are you afraid to coming in my room?
- No.
And you were such a bold caballero downstairs.
- Come.
- I guess it was the music. And you!
- And your singing.
- Oh, no, no. She is no good.
But my dancing-¡Olé! ¡Olé!
Why are you so shy up here?
- I'm not going to hurt you much.
And you were so bold downstairs.
Walked so straight, like a soldier.
- Maybe you're an officer!
- Oh, no!
What made you say that?
- I guess it was the music.
Want some cognac?
Uh, it's a little early in the day for me. I, uh-
I don't think I'd better.
Hmm. She is too strong.
I don't like him either.
I have some old wine from my country.
I give it to you.
You come with me?
The name of this wine, she is Lágrimas de Amor.
- What does it mean?
- "Tears of Love."
Please.
I really don't think I'd better.
Please? A little bit?
You want me to like you more?
Oh, do I!
Well, here I am, waiting on the prado.
- Here I am, walking on the prado, Mr. -
- Bob.
I was gonna call you Captain Bob.
That's your ship, isn't it?
Yes, that's the old scow-
40 decks, all glass, concrete bottom... and bales of straw.
- Now you're spoofing!
- Oh, no, I'm not.
But you can't fool me. I have a brother who considers himself quite a mariner.
- So I know a little about boats.
- All right, my boat-what is she?
Well, that's just a good, old three-masted schooner.
Captain, I hate to be a tattletale, but orders are orders.
- I just saw Mr. Cobb talking to some women.
- No!
- Yes, sir.
- Tsk, tsk, tsk.
Weren't your orders strictly not to fraternize with them?
Yes. I'll tell you, Elmer.
You remind me of it when we get aboard ship.
Don't tell anyone.
- It's between you and me.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Let's take a walk before he tells on me.
Sailing this afternoon?
- Yes.
- When?
Sailor's luck. Sailing on the tide.
I never wanted to stay in a port so much in all my life as I do this one.
- You're coming back, aren't you?
- Do you want me to come back?
- Then I'll be back.
- When?
Oh, well, that depends on a lot of things.
Say, I've got a snapshot of you here, but I don't know your name.
Are you really coming back?
Yes.
Bob, it's Anna Marie.
Anna Marie.
You like me?
Gee, you're like somebody you dream about- strange, different from any of the girls I ever knew at home.
I could always figure them out, but I can't you.
When I listen to you sing or talk...
I feel like I'm- like I'm drinking wine.
Now you're bold again.
I like you that way.
- Have some more wine.
- I've- I've had enough.
- I've gotta get back.
- Get back where?
- I've gotta get back.
- Why?
Because- Because...
Captain said... can't be... too careful.
Can't be- Ohh!
Hoffman!
- Hoffman!
- Ja, Fräulein?
"Ensign Cabot."
No- Speak the English.
Don't know a word.
- No?
- Going upstairs.
- Very handsome, sir, those naval academy rings.
Oh, yes, yes. Thanks very much.
Prost.
Perhaps I might suggest a better toast, Captain.
Why not?
To our next meeting.
Let's hope it'll be real soon,
Herr, uh, Oberleutnant.
You see that, Mac?
- I'll be.
- Stumbled right into 'em.
Suppose they notify the Spanish authorities about us.
Oh, no.
They're too smart for that.
They'd be interned themselves.
Well, I don't like the looks of things.
- You don't?
- No.
- Mac, it's a stroke of luck.
- What do you mean?
They're here for the same purpose we are- to get food and refuel.
I'll bet my salary against yours that we meet them outside the head within 24 hours.
- You really think so?
- Sure. Get all the men together.
- See that every man is mustered in.
I'll get the papers.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Sir!
- Yes?
- Can I borrow another-
- No! Report aboard immediately!
Aye, aye, sir.
- Good evening, sir.
- Step lively. Step lively. On you go.
- That's the last of 'em. Everybody aboard.
- Captain!
Mr. Cabot hasn't reported yet, sir.
- Positive, Cobb?
- Yes, sir.
Organize a searching party right away.
Let's find him.
Very well, sir. All right, all you men!
Up you come! On the double!
Kaufman, take out a searching party.
Doggy, go with Kaufman.
MacGregor, take a searching party.
You men come with me.
On the double!
Make it snappy there!
All right, Chief, keep a lookout.
Waggoner! Jenkins!
To the cantina right away.
Cobb, the other end of the prado.
Three men.
- Double quick!
- Come with me right away.
- You haven't seen a young officer off a merchant ship, have you?
- No! No!
- Are you sure he wasn't here buying something?
- I told you, no! No!
Aww- Come on.
- No reports yet, sir.
- Keep a lookout, both of you.
Cabot?
- No report as yet, sir.
- All right. Board ship! Board ship!
- No report yet, sir.
- All right. Stand by, Kaufman.
Kaufman, keep a lookout for the chief.
Order one shore boat.
- No report yet.
- Stand on the dock.
- That's the last man, Captain.
- I hate to leave that kid here in a strange port.
- Yeah, it's pretty tough, all right.
- Just got his commission.
First trip.
If I didn't have to get fuel aboard the sub,
I'd search every hole on this island.
- Say, Mac, you don't suppose-
- Suppose what?
- Nothing. I was thinking about those three Germans we met.
- The tide is changing.
- We'd better be going aboard ship.
- All right, all right.
Everybody aboard!
Captain Kingsley!
Captain Kingsley!
Captain Kingsley!
All right, Mac, head 'er out to sea.
- Ensign Cabot left in port.
- Very well, sir.
All right, Quartermaster, up to 230.
I think, for safety, we'd better change the name of this schooner.
Pick any name and have it painted on the side.
Well, Captain, for a vessel with such graceful lines and a splendid, broad beam...
I can think of no prettier name than the Judy Ann McCarthy... the name of the girl I loved.
Two hundred and eighty pounds of as nice a girl as-
Margolis, get me a can of paint!
Mm-hmm!
Danke schön.
Ernst!
Kapitän.
- Ernst!
Ja.
Ja.
I am... Ensign Richard Cabot...
United States...
Navy.
Please tell Captain-
Captain-
How it hurts.
- Tell-Tell Captain-
I- I-
Franz. Ernst.
Ja.
Ernst.
Auf Wiedersehen.
Auf Wiedersehen, Ernst.
Anna Marie.
They're oil barrels all right, Chief.
Gangway there.
Captain, it looks like a fire.
But I'd be careful.
It might be a trap.
There's a body floating around there, sir.
- All right. Mac?
- Yes, sir.
- Stand by with that whale boat.
- Very well, sir.
Small boat on the starboard beam!
Hey, Joe! Your outer jib!
All right. I'll fix it.
All right, sailors! Come alongside!
We'll pick you up.
Stand by!
Ho! Heave ho!
- Heave!
- All right. A little further.
- Heave!
- Heave!
All right, miss. Watch your head on the boom coming by here.
- Okay. Shove off now.
- Shove away. Shove away, boy.
- Shove away.
- All right.
Take it easy there.
All right.
Have that girl come off there.
All right. Get off, young lady!
All right.
Get that young lady aboard here.
Come on.
- Hands off that line there!
- Hands off the line!
Steady with that boat hook.
- All right now.
- All right. On the deck, young lady.
- Off you go!
Stand by, Cobb. Stand by.
Get ahold of that lady.
All right, miss.
Get ahold of it, miss.
You've only got 15 miles. You can make it all right. Toss it over there. All right.
Oh, thank you so much! We've been drifting out in that boat for hours.
- Bob!
- Mr. MacGregor.
- Yes, sir.
- Take this lady to my cabin, get her something warm to drink.
- Very well. Come along.
Come along, miss. This way.
- But, Bob!
All right, you sailors. Shove off.
You've got 15 miles to shore.
- You're welcome. You're welcome.
- All right.
- Tie that- Tie that line.
Yes?
Bob!
Anna Marie.
I'm sorry to inform you, but I'm forced to detain you aboard as a prisoner.
A prisoner? For what?
What have I done?
One of our junior officers was found dead, floating near some oil barrels.
One of your junior officers?
From this ship?
Yes. Ensign Cabot.
Did you know him?
Why, no-
Why should I know him?
He was found in the vicinity of your lifeboat.
Therefore, I must hold you for investigation.
But you can't do that!
I'm a- I'm a Danish subject.
We'll keep you as comfortable as possible.
But you've got to listen to me!
You must give me a chance to explain!
Good night.
- Bob, will you-
- Something you want, miss?
No. Thank you.
- How 'bout some java, Skipper?
All right, Kaufman. Hurry up with that breakfast. You're wanted topside.
Orders of the day:
Panic party stand by.
All hands remain below deck.
Today is the day.
- Hey, miss!
- What ya tryin' to do?
- Oh, come on, miss. What's the matter with you?
You're gonna get us into trouble!
Get up out of that boat!
Are you trying to give us
French leave or somethin'?
The captain is gonna give us the deuce if you do that.
Come on. Let's go down here where you belong.
- What's happened here?
- The young lady tried to go over the side in a boat.
Get that boat into shape.
Keep out of sight with those white hats.
Come on, come on, come on.
What's the matter with you, sister?
Be a good kid and stay here where you belong, instead of running all over the ship.
Sure. You'll get us all in trouble putting that boat over the side like that.
Captain's dotey enough as it is.
- And say, Gretchen-
- Gretchen?
- Hilda, Hilda.
- Oh, whatever her name is.
Say, why don't you go over there and cork off?
You know, take a nap, go to sleep.
And if you're a good little girl,
I'll get you some coffee.
- And I'll get you a magazine full of swell pictures.
- What do you say?
- All right, men. Topside. On the double. Come on.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Well, Anna Marie, don't you think it's about time you cut out these tricks?
- Oh, Bob, don't be so hard.
- Hard?
Say, do you realize you should be shot for a spy?
Spy? I- I told you last night I'm Swedish.
Swedish. Last night you told me you were Danish.
Now, you're neither Danish nor Swedish.
You're German.
And you had something to do with the refueling of that U-boat.
That's why I'm holding you a prisoner.
Why, Bob, I thought you liked me.
Sure I liked you.
First time I saw you ashore,
I liked you.
I'm human.
You're a woman... and not hard to look at.
You liked me then.
What's wrong with me now?
There's nothing wrong with you,
Anna Marie. I wish to, well-
That's got nothing to do with it.
Don't you realize there's something going on in this world much bigger than you and I?
War.
Don't you realize, Bob, there's something even bigger than war?
No. For you and me, no.
Oh, Bob, please let me go.
Let me have a small boat.
I'll go ashore. I'll get there somehow.
What for? To cause more trouble?
I want you to understand this, Anna Marie.
I'm an American officer.
I'm in command of an American ship... and it's my duty to hold you here.
You, an American officer, in command of an American ship!
Where's your colors?
Where's your uniform?
I know where they are.
They're hidden away in that closet.
Why? Are you ashamed of them?
Why don't you hoist your colors and put on your uniform and get up there and fight... like a man, like a sailor, like my brother?
- Like your brother?
- Yes. Captain Von Steuben.
The man you're looking for, commander of the U172.
Oh, we know all about you,
Captain Kingsley, and your mystery ship.
We know your mission.
We know you're out to get my brother.
But you won't get him.
He's far too brave and clever to be trapped... by this pack of rats you've got hiding in the hold of this ship!
Oh, I hope to goodness you find him.
I hope he meets you.
He'll answer your insults!
Why, he'll break you to pieces like a-
Bob. Captain.
We're picking up a submarine on our hydrophones about two miles away.
Good. Good.
All right, men. Shove off.
Anna Marie, I think you're gonna get your wish.
- Sure you got 'em?
- Yes, sir.
It's a German U-boat all right.
- About a mile and a half away.
- Uh-huh.
- You can hear 'em yourself, sir.
You're right. Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
- Mac, contact Captain Day.
Pipe all hands. Oh, Cobb.
- Right-o.
- Yes, sir.
- Give those reserves below a little fight talk.
- The old hero stuff. Ten yards to go.
- All right, sir.
Die for dear old-You know what I mean.
What's his name.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Captain Day is right here, sir.
You bet we're ready, sir.
Captain Kingsley, sir.
- Contact, sir!
- I'll talk with him. Stand by.
I'll speak with him.
Hello, Shorty? Yeah, we just picked up-
You picked 'em up too, huh?
Good. Good. Stand ready to let go your hawser.
Uh-huh. Looks like the kickoff any minute now.
Thanks. Thanks. Same to you.
All right.
Panic party, on the topside.
On the double there!
Remember, Myrtle.
Don't forget to scream.
She's a half a mile off now, sir.
All right, you men. Snap into it.
Fall in now. On the double!
- Make it snappy there now. Come on. Come on.
- Pick it up.
- Where's that man playing the captain's wife?
- Here, sir.
All right. What's this?
What have you got here?
- In the last act of Bertha, the Sewing Machine Girl-
- Never mind it.
Give him the parrot there. I want you men to carry on as instructed. Is that understood?
- Aye, aye, sir.
- You, in the aft cabin, on the double.
- You, up on the bridge.
The rest of you men in position.
- Snap into it now!
- You there!
- Yes, sir!
- That ain't regulation, sir.
- No, it's a boy.
Keep that machine gun below deck.
Come on. Watch those white hats.
Ja. 
Mystery ship.
- Mystery ship?
"Judy Ann McCarthy."
"Judy Ann McCarthy."
- They're right on top of us, sir.
- Yes, I can see them.
Come on now, Margolis. Stand by.
Give it to 'em when you get a chance.
Aye, sir.
Well, Stanley Northcross II, are you ready to make history?
Yes, sir. Ready and anxious, sir.
With the captain's permission, look.
It's fine, Stanley. Great.
But what will your mother say?
Well, that, sir, is problematical.
- Oh, Captain-
- Wait a minute. Down, fellows.
Now, don't get anxious.
Keep your heads down, you men.
- Have you got the bag full?
- Yes, sir.
That's the old pepper.
- How is she?
- Oh, just giving us the once-over.
Old periscope sticking straight up.
- I'm ready, sir.
- How are you, Saunders?
- Fine, thank you, sir.
- Good.
You didn't shave today, did you?
Well, you see, sir, I don't shave yet, sir.
That's right. You don't.
Well, you'll probably have a full beard by the time this is over.
Thank you, sir. I hope so.
Keep it down now, fellows. Keep it down.
- Captain, I'd like to show-
- I'll look at it later.
I'll look at all you boys later.
Keep your heads down.
Keep your ears and eyes open.
All right, fellows. Now keep your eyes open there. Ready to go at any moment now.
- Help! Don't fire! Don't fire!
- Hold it!
Feuer!
- All right, you fellows-
All right! Go aft! Go aft, you men!
Aft you go!
Try and contact that guy!
- Whoo!
- Hey, wait a minute! Wait a minute!
No!
That flag's international code-
"Stay away."
Bob, let-
- Finnegan!
- Aye, aye, sir.
Take this woman and put her in that boat.
Take that other boy and keep him aboard here.
She makes a move, shoot her.
Get that girl aboard.
There.
All right. Snap into it.
Let those poles go.
Keep your eyes open.
We'll go any minute.
- All right.
- All right.
Panic party's away and clear, sir.
All right. Fine. Great stuff, Mac.
Shelling damage your hull much, sir?
Oh, it put quite a hole in it, Mac.
- Taking on quite a bit of water?
- About eight feet of water.
She's taking a wide swing around us now, sir.
Head into her a little, Mac.
Head into her.
- We've got quite a bit of drift too, sir.
- Head into her.
- Pretty damp, eh, Cobb?
- Just a trifle, Captain.
- Little afraid of that panic party.
- You are, sir?
Yeah, I think they're wise to us out there.
Watch those white caps!
Pipe down, all of you back there!
No, Shorty, no. No, no. Stand by.
Well, Saunders, how do you feel?
Well, I-I feel pretty good, sir.
Thank you, sir.
You're a veteran now.
You've been under fire.
Were you a little nervous, a little frightened?
Well, yes, Captain, I-I was-Well-
Aw, Captain, I'll confess.
I was a bit frightened at first, but I'll stick it out. Look!
We want to keep away from that U-boat.
Now hard on that port oar there!
Hiya, miss. You feel all right?
Better put that around you.
Mystery ship.
No, no. Not yet.
Not yet. I'll tell you when.
- Get that contact, Cobb.
- Yes, sir.
Telephone.
All right, you men. Get ahold of that tarpaulin down there, you!
All right, Captain.
Here we go, Captain.
- All right. Cut her off, Cobb.
- All right, sir.
No, I'll tell you when.
Hold off down there. I'll tell you when.
Keep that gun covered down there.
All right, you men.
Stand by, all you men. Stand by.
Keep down up there!
- Hold off. I'll tell you when.
Get that contact again, Cobb.
- Yes, sir.
Yeah. Hello, Shorty. Yeah.
Oh, fine, fine. We got a lot of water.
About eight feet, I guess.
No, the railroad ties will keep her afloat.
She's all right.
- Hold it. Keep that contact.
- Yes, sir. I got it.
All merchant marine outfits have been accounted for... except one derby hat, size seven and an eighth.
- What'll I do about it?
- Write me a letter, Elmer.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Yes. Hello, Shorty. No, no.
Stand by. Stand by, Shorty.
Don't get anxious.
All right. Stand by those pumps, men, and work 'em!
I'm afraid she's filling up faster than they can pump it out, Captain.
- Contact, Cobb.
- The water's getting higher, sir.
It's up around the magazines.
- All the men out of the hold?
- Yes, sir.
No, sir. Elmer's down there.
- Go down and tell him I said to come up out of there.
- Yes, sir.
- All right. Contact, Captain.
- Hello, hello.
- Just a minute, Shorty. What is it, Mac?
- It looks hopeless, Bob.
She won't come any closer.
She won't engage us.
- Get back contact.
- Yes, sir.
- All right. Contact, sir.
- Hello, Shorty.
I'm about to lay a U-boat in your lap.
Yeah. You're on your own.
We're sinking here.
Stand by to cast off the towline.
And good luck.
All right, you men! Attention!
I want you men to stand ready... to abandon ship!
Elmer! Hey, Elmer!
- Oh, Elmer.
- What do you want, son?
The captain wants you top-
Why, Elmer Skilling, you're smoking cigarettes.
I'm gonna tell your mother.
- Go on. Scram, punk.
- Listen. You can't talk to me that way!
- Anyway, the captain wants you topside right away.
- Orders is orders.
- He told me to stay down here.
- Well, he told me that-
- Where's Elmer and Saunders?
- Down below, sir.
- In the hold, sir.
- They're below deck, sir.
They are? Keep your heads down, men.
Keep your heads down!
- Yes, sir.
- Stand ready with that hose.
All right. Second panic party.
- Over the side. On the double. Quick!
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Hey! Hey!
- Hey!
All right, Cobb.
You're in command of the ship now.
Aye, sir. Thank you, sir.
- Come on, Mac. You've lived long enough.
- Okay, Skipper.
All right! Stand by on topside!
Stand by, you fellows, to take Elmer.
- I got him.
- Pull him out.
Pull him out there.
Just down there. Just down there.
All right, MacGregor?
Elmer. Come on.
You all right, Elmer?
Quick. Come on, wake up.
Wake up!
Wake up. Wake up, boys!
Wake up. Wake up.
- Wake up.
- Okay, Elmer?
Come on, Tommy old boy.
You're all right! That's the stuff.
I lost the derby hat.
I'm sorry, Captain.
That's all right. We'll get another one.
All right! Stand by!
The U-boat's coming into range, sir!
Captain!
The U-boat's coming into range!
All right! Stand by your stations!
Stand by your stations.
Stand by.
All right.
Go back to your stations.
Costello? Costello?
- Here she comes, sir.
- Costello!
Here she comes, at point-blank range.
- Ernst!
- Hey!
- Sit down! What's the-
She's fallen for the trap, sir.
Bugler, stand by.
Here she comes.
- Here she comes.
- Stand ready, Costello.
Wait a second.
- Now, sir.
- Commence firing.
Thirty-one.
Feuer!
- Thirty-two!
Thirty-three!
All right.
They've had it. Give 'em hell!
Number one tube, ready for firing.
Number one tube, ready for firing.
Number one, ready for firing.
Number one tube ready for firing, sir.
- Stations for battle surface.
- Stations for battle surface.
Stations manned and ready, sir.
- Stand by.
- Stand by.
Stand by!
- Number one!
- Number one!
- Fire!
- Fire!
Number one, fire!
Costello, cease firing!
Mac, look! Spike! She's going down, and they're stickin' with it!
Stand by to lower that whale boat, pick 'em up.
- All you men, stand by to lower that port whale boat!
- Pick 'em up! Pick 'em up!
- All right, men.
- Auf Wiedersehen.
Auf Wiedersehen, Ernst.
Well, Anna Marie... we're going away.
Isn't there something you want to say to me?
No, Bob, there isn't.
I know different.
We've both got something to say... and we'll be sorry all our lives if we don't say it.
Well, Bob, what is there to say?
You've won.
Won?
I've lost.
Lost the only thing I ever cared for.
No, you haven't.
You'll never lose that.
- You mean that?
Still you're going away with your brother and your fian-
- Lieutenant Schiller.
- I'm going with my brother.
Oh, listen, Anna Marie.
You don't have to go.
Don't you see that little church over there?
Why, you and I could be the happiest people if you'll only-
No, Bob. Don't you see?
I've got to go.
They're my own people.
My country's sick, in trouble.
My people are losing.
If I didn't stick to them now,
I wouldn't be worth wanting.
I wouldn't be what you'd call a good sport.
- Oh, Bob, I can't make it clear to you.
- Oh, I understand, dear.
The picture of you and me-
It's on the film here.
- Here. You take it.
- Thanks.
You keep it for me.
Now I've got something to come back for.
All right, Lieutenant. Take your men.
Forward march!
MAN: Well, folks, there's not
much doubt about what's happening.
We continue with the latest returns.
Illinois is just reporting.
Roosevelt, 54,897. Hoover, 13,242.
Virginia:
Roosevelt, 11,987. Hoover, 4354.
Ohio:
Roosevelt, 18,361. Hoover, 3530.
We're going to hear from Pennsylvania
in just a second.
North Dakota:
Hoover, 2767. Roosevelt, 5299.
Iowa:
Roosevelt, 14,874. Hoover, 10,342.
Kentucky:
Roosevelt, 5936. Hoover, 3542.
Here's another dispatch from Idaho,
always a Republican stronghold.
Hoover, 946. Roosevelt, 2288.
President Hoover has just sent a telegram
of congratulations to Governor Roosevelt.
It's all over but the shouting.
This has been the greatest Democratic
landslide in the history of American politics.
Governor Roosevelt has carried
practically every state...
...sweeping all opposition before him.
It certainly marks the end of one era
and the beginning of another.
MAN [OVER RADIO]:
Well, here's something interesting.
A flash from Milwaukee.
The brewing interests plan
to start immediate production of beer.
And a flash from California.
Governor Rolph announces that
he intends to release all prisoners...
...held for liquor violations
in that state.
Listen to this, from New York State.
Democratic leaders announce that
Roosevelt will use all his influence...
...to have the 18th Amendment repealed
as soon as possible.
[WHISTLES]
It looks as if the Noble Experiment
was on its last legs.
The handwriting on the wall
for Prohibition.
It's taken us 12 years to realize...
Well, it's all over, boys.
We're washed up.
I knew it was coming.
What did I always tell you?
I knew it was too good to last.
Well, it lasted long enough to put us in the dough.
But it ain't no more.
Hey, you mugs, all of you, come here.
Come and get it.
- What are you doing, Bugs?
- This is the payoff.
Might as well cut it up right now and call it quits.
We're through.
[SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY]
Just a minute. Pipe down, will you?
You just heard the bad news.
Our racket can't last much longer.
I'm stepping out of it tonight...
...and if you're smart, you'll all step out of it.
Here you are, Butch.
This is for the vine-covered cottage out in the country somewheres.
You can grow your own vegetables, sweetheart.
Here you are, Al.
Split it up with the kids.
[TALKING INDISTINCTLY]
All right, just a minute.
I ain't kidding now.
And another thing.
From right now on, no more mob, see?
No more organization.
We're all on our own.
Bugs, what are you gonna do?
[SCOFFS]
I'm gonna mingle with the upper classes.
I'm gonna be a gentleman.
Roosevelt elected. Hey, paper here.
Read all about it. Beer in six months.
- Hey, special extra.
MAN 1: Extra.
MAN 2: Read all about it.
MAN 1: Roosevelt promises beer in April.
Why didn't you take your car?
You're just begging some guy to put one in you.
I feel like walking. I'm restless.
Oh, quitting like this,
I hate to see you do it, Bugs.
Stepping out of the picture.
Handing the town right over to Joe Milano.
Well, it suits me.
In six months, he'll be out of business and broke.
I'm going to step out while I've still got mine.
Good evening, Mr. Ahearn.
MAN 2:
Oh, yes, we have. Roosevelt elected.
- How do, Nelson?
- Did you and the boys vote today?
MAN 2: Read all about it. Roosevelt elected.
- Six times apiece.
So Uncle Sam has muscled in on your racket, huh? Ha-ha-ha.
MAN 1:
Beer in six months.
For a leaden nickel,
I'd take a poke at that flatfoot.
- Just one good poke.
- No, no, don't, Bugs.
You're right, Al.
I got a million and a quarter salted away, and all he's got is flat feet.
Let him laugh.
- What's eating the Little Giant tonight?
- He's going out of business.
How do you like that?
Bugs, is this on the level?
Yeah, it's on the level. I'm through.
Why, honey, you could no more quit than you could stop breathing.
- It's your life.
- No?
Hey, you think I like to sweat and worry
20 hours a day?
Scheme, connive, play both ends against the middle...
...live on the edge of a volcano liable to blow up?
You think it's fun to spend your life...
...waiting for some mug to spray you with a machinegun?
I can't go anywheres without a bodyguard.
I'm always tense, coiled up like a spring...
...ready to duck the moment anybody flashes a rod.
Every time I step into my car, get near a window, walk around the block.
Every time somebody opens the door,
I hunch my shoulder waiting for that thunder.
That's how I've lived for the last 10 years.
And believe me, sister, I got a bellyful.
Must be great to have dough to quit on.
By cutting all the corners,
I'll manage to eat...
...and keep the rain off me.
Yessiree.
I'm a young guy that knows all the answers...
...and got my whole life before me.
Yeah, and I'm all washed up with mugs.
I know, I came from the gutter, but I'm stepping right out of it.
I'm gonna meet some real people.
Do something worthwhile, amount to something.
When you meet these people, what are you gonna talk about?
Machine guns and beer?
I'll manage to talk to them, all right, and they'll listen.
I've been reading a lot.
I've been studying.
I ain't been wasting my time.
What do you think I've been reading all them books for? Here.
Greek philosophy.
Pluto.
Yeah,
I bet you thought Pluto was a water.
I'm just crawling with education.
I've been reading all them Greeks.
They do plenty beside shining shoes and running lunchrooms.
Sure, they don't do bad in a dark alley with a stiletto, either.
Yeah, smart guy, ain't you?
What do you think I've been buying all them pictures for?
Here, take a hinge at that one.
You ever seen anything like that before?
Not since I've been off cocaine.
No, you dumb head.
I suppose you think that's a cat having a fit...
...in a bucket of tomato ketchup.
Well, it ain't, see? That's art.
Why, it's one of the finest examples of, uh, fu...
Futurism. Yeah.
Why, that's got, uh, dynamic rhythm.
Yeah, that's what it's got, and tone color.
But it ain't got a nickel's worth of perspective.
You know, pictures without perspective, well, that's the last word in art today.
Go on, point me out some perspective.
I dare you to.
What for?
Do you know how much that set me back?
Twelve hundred smackers.
Why, it's a genuine Kaputzawich.
- Who's he?
- The guy who painted that picture.
Oh.
Yeah, what am I fixing to talk to them about?
See, I'm just crawling with culture.
Ask me anything.
What do you wanna know?
A good reason why I shouldn't get stinking drunk.
What's the matter with me as a picture, darling?
- Looks like you two wanna be alone.
- We could spare you.
BUGS:
Mm?
Oh, no, not tonight, Josephine.
I got a lot of heavy thinking to do.
Me for the hay.
Good night.
[HUMMING
WAGNER'S "PILGRIM'S CHORUS"]
You know, that's the "Pilgrim's Chorus" by Wagner.
Grand opera.
[HUMMING]
[BUGS CHUCKLING]
Yeah.
Phoned you a couple times this morning.
Well, I was down the Civic Auditorium listening to a lecture on technocracy.
What's that?
Well, the guy's pan was all over whiskers.
He kept mumbling in them so I couldn't hear.
Oh, boy.
The pro says I'm getting that left wrist swell. Ha-ha-ha.
- So the skids are under me, huh?
- Well, it's tough.
Oh, us dames always get it sooner or later.
It's like death or the taxes.
I hate to do this, kid.
You been a great pal.
Never mind the song and dance.
Oh, I ain't sore, Bugs.
You say quit, so it's quit.
Here, let me help you.
Why, honey, this is far too much.
I couldn't take it.
Oh, go on, take it. It's yours.
You've been a great gal, honey.
Oh, well.
So long.
Come see us sometime.
All the luck in the world to you, Edith.
Thank you, dear.
Same to you.
- How'd she take it?
- Standing up.
Did you get rid of the trucks?
Yeah, the Ajax Trucking Company was glad.
I sold all the ammunition to the Army and Navy store.
Oh, here.
Here's the checks.
Swell.
Say, did you get rid of the choppers?
Well, there ain't much market for machine guns...
...but I phoned a Mexican I know in El Paso, and he's gonna take all we got.
We're a cinch to get rid of our breweries and warehouses.
- We can sell them to the government.
- The government?
Sure, ain't they muscling in into our business?
[CHUCKLING]
Well, that's swell.
Oh, um...
Oh, Bugs?
Yeah?
I was just kind of thinking.
Now that you've got rid of the boys, trucks, ammunition, and the choppers and Edith...
...I was wondering, well, what you were figuring to do with me.
Well, why don't you take a little trip for yourself?
You mean, us split up?
Oh, don't give me that.
We've been together since we was kids over on Blue Island Avenue.
- I know, but seeing as how...
- You're gonna put no skids under Al.
I started with you,
I'm sticking with you, even if I have to wade to my hips in art.
Look at all the good times we had together.
Remember the time we busted into that loft after them furs?
Yeah, and you went into a panic over that big stuffed polar bear in the corner.
- I gave it to him.
- You sure opened up on him.
The cops on the West Side was swarming that joint...
...like they was bees around a hive.
And in reform school, when we got a hold of that saltpeter.
Hey, boy, will I ever forget that?
We dumped it in the sugar bowl.
[LAUGHING]
Yeah, boy, we certainly did have fun before we went in the big business.
We're gonna keep on having fun, together.
Where Papa goes, Mama goes.
- Okay, you're in.
- Swell.
Yeah, but you gotta keep improving yourself.
I'm serious about this getting-up-in-the-world idea...
...and I don't want no anchor to drag around.
- Understand?
- Uh-huh.
MAN:
Hey, Jim.
Frankie wants to see you.
All right.
Come on, Frankie, drag it in.
Hello, what's on your mind?
Look, Bugs,
I'm up in Joe Milano's joint.
I'm in the bathroom, but I hear them gabbing outside the door.
Joe and the boys are coming up here and give you a good going-over.
Yeah? So they found out who hijacked their trucks last week?
Yeah, Joe says they're gonna beat the can off you.
That greaseball's gonna beat the can off of us, huh?
- He is, huh? I'll get the boys...
- Just a minute.
I'll take care of this.
Thanks for the tip.
Here, scram and buy yourself a cigar.
I'm practically gone, sweetheart.
Much obliged for the sugar.
Let me phone the boys.
We'll put them in the other room.
- When Joe's mob walks in...
- Yeah, we'll start shooting.
Put ourselves on the spot with the coppers, and what for?
That's all we need now.
I told you we were through, and I meant it.
You gonna sit here and let that garlic blossom give you the finger?
- Well, we'll blow out of town, quick.
- Well, where?
Well, let me see.
Say, how's for Europe?
My old man come from there.
He says it ain't bad.
- Nope, you gotta have a passport.
- Okay, we'll get ourselves one.
You can't get a passport unless you have a receipt that you paid your tax.
Oh, yeah, I forgot.
Old Man Income Tax.
And they call this a free country.
BUGS:
There's our dish.
Golf, polo, the blue Pacific.
Well, that don't sound bad for a starter.
Great climate, plenty of class and far away.
"Santa Barb..."
- Say, I wonder what that "Santa" means.
- That must be Spanish for saint.
Yeah?
[LAUGHING]
- What's eating you?
- I was just thinking.
A couple of hoodlums like us moving in on a saint.
[CHUCKLING]
- What do you want?
- Western Union. Telegram.
Who is it for?
Milano. Joe Milano.
Hello, Bugs. We was just discussing you.
I'm leaving town, Joe.
I didn't wanna overlook saying goodbye to you.
Oh, sure.
Especially since I heard you was gonna call on me.
[JOE GRUNTS]
Seeing as how I'm leaving town...
...I didn't want you guys to get the idea you was running me out.
Come on, Al.
That train won't wait forever.
[CROWD CHATTERING]
So long. Don't take any lead nickels, now.
No, I won't.
You use this to play them pansy games with.
If you get into any trouble out there, you can bean some guy with them.
I'll be using them.
You can depend on that.
- Hey, Bugs?
BUGS: Yeah?
- I got something nifty for you.
- What's it for, Red?
Kind of an outdoor chair.
This is to keep it from going too far in the ground.
This is to keep it under control at the other end.
[ALL LAUGHING]
Well, that's just the thing
I'll need, Red.
Hey, Bugs, here's all the words.
Now you'll know what them dudes out there is talking about.
[ALL LAUGHING]
- Hey, Bugs?
BUGS: Yeah?
Take these while you can still smell them.
[ALL LAUGHING AND CHATTERING]
So long, boys.
Oh, boy, what a view.
Look at that ocean.
And them palm trees, real too.
Best I ever seen before was on picture postcards.
Yeah, and them furnishings.
I don't know whether you know it, Al, but that's real Spanish.
Believe me, those Spaniards certainly knew their onions.
Boy, what a layout.
Well, it ought to be.
Take a squint at that.
"Forty-five dol..." Per day?
Boy, we're traveling in a fast company.
Forty... Seven times 40, that's 280...
- It's over 300 bucks a week.
- Oh, it ain't the money that burns me.
I'll give over 300 a week to the bellhops around here.
I don't want them to get that they got a yap up here.
Nobody ever made no sucker out of me.
"Forty-five do..."
Here goes some of their profit.
Forty-five dollars a day.
The nerve of them guys.
Charging anything like that.
I'll show them where to get off.
Yessiree.
Up here.
Oh, you too.
Yes.
Yeah.
You going screwy?
They ain't gonna make a chump out of me.
Boy, I'm gonna get me money's worth.
Yessiree.
Yeah.
I'll show them they can't get off.
Say, why do we have to put on these monkey suits?
Why couldn't we wear a tux?
I tell you, nobody in this kind of joint wears tuxedos at night but waiters.
Well, if you're wrong, you'd better order yourself an ambulance.
[CHATTERING]
Hey, come here.
I suppose you're gonna tell me all these guys are waiters.
They're all dressed wrong. We're right.
Well, listening to you, it's a wonder
I didn't end up down here in pajamas.
Oh, this is great.
Perfect. Real class.
And what atmosphere.
I get a kick out of this, don't you?
You can have my interest in it free.
I know, you rather be in a cellar shooting crap.
Just lead me to that cellar.
Hmm.
Mr. Stanley will be here in just a minute.
Yes, Miss Cass.
Hey, uh, don't turn around until I give you the office.
What's the matter? How many?
- They got rods?
- No, you ape, it's a skirt.
And is she the McCoy.
Thought some guy had the finger on us.
One quick hinge at her and you can tell she's a lady.
It's painted on her like a billboard.
- You wanna meet her?
- Do you know her?
No, but I can ease over there, break the ice.
Mush-head.
You ain't on North Clark Street.
You're in society now.
Out here, you don't talk to people till you've been introduced.
Oh, dames are alike all over the world.
I bet I could...
Say, you stay put or I'll bend this water bottle over your skull.
Oh, boy, am I hungry.
Am I gonna give a big steak a good home.
- They got me.
- What?
Oh, the score card.
I can't read nothing on it but the date.
Oh, it's in French.
Oh, well, let's order the whole thing.
Maybe there's a steak among it.
[SPEAKING IN FRENCH]
[IN ENGLISH] Yes, sir.
Consommé, chicken and fried potatoes.
[IN ENGLISH]
Talk French, you chump, and talk it loud.
[SPEAKING IN FRENCH]
When did you learn how to talk this monkey jabber?
[IN ENGLISH] I used to have 10 percent of a French dame.
[CHATTERING]
All right, so why?
It's a game.
What for?
Listen, stupid.
The guys in the white shirts are playing against the guys in the red.
Each team is trying to knock the ball through the other team's goal.
Get it?
- Then what?
- Oh, shut up.
Oh, boy, there's that dame again.
Gee, I wish I could find out some way of getting properly introduced.
You've been beefing about that since last night.
Why don't you give up?
Leave it, leave it.
Oh, come on, let's scram.
This game's dead.
There ain't no excitement.
[WHISTLE BLOWS]
Let's hop into town and pick up a couple of waitresses.
I didn't come out here to hustle any waitresses.
First-class or nothing.
They won't come near you.
They won't even give you a tumble.
Yeah, they walk around us like we have smallpox.
Forty-five bucks a day and they high-hat you.
They wouldn't let you in the golf club, huh?
Who said they wouldn't?
Just so happens that one of the gazebos on membership committee is out of town.
When will he be back?
Well, they ain't so sure about that.
He's in Europe or something.
- Europe, huh?
- Yeah.
You're gonna get in?
Why, sure, I'm gonna get in.
That's a cinch.
We could get up to Frisco and back before that guy comes home from Europe.
Now, there's a great town, that Frisco.
Wide-open.
Good eats, good liquor and just crawling with beautiful, friendly dames.
And little Hymie give me a couple of good addresses.
I wonder how long a guy could stay drunk if he really tried.
Okay, we'll drive up there tomorrow and find out.
Whoopee!
Make out like you don't know me.
Boy, am I glad to screw out of that morgue.
Three days and we don't even get a tumble.
Yeah, you're right.
A lot of half-witted chumps riding around on Shetland ponies, knocking a little ball.
And a lot of high-hat baboons sitting on horses...
...all swelled up with themselves, won't talk to nobody.
Horses.
Before I die,
I'm gonna burn down a livery stable.
[HOOFS BEATING]
Stop. Stop the car.
Hey, where you going?
She must be hurt. I'm going to help her.
Say, you hurt bad?
I seen... I saw your horse run away, and I knew you had an accident, so I...
There wasn't any accident.
We got off and tied up the horses.
No accident?
Of course not.
My horse broke loose and headed for town.
She'll go right back to the stables.
[CHUCKLES]
Well, goodbye.
Goodbye.
Hey, mister.
Did you call me, madam?
Have you got a car?
Why, yes, ma'am.
I've got a luncheon engagement.
I don't wanna wait any longer.
Would you be kind enough to drive me home?
Oh, lady, I'd carry you home.
Oh, let me...
Oh, please.
Well, thanks so much.
If you weren't leaving town,
I'd ask you to drop in for tea.
Oh, I'm not leaving town.
I've decided to stay here all winter.
Well, thanks for the lift.
We'll be at home any time after 4 tomorrow, if you care to drop in.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
- Back to town, quick.
- What for?
- I thought we're heading for Frisco.
- Never mind.
We're going back.
I've gotta find the best tailor.
A tailor?
You got a suit for every day in the week.
Come on, come on, get going.
[CHUCKLES]
How do you do, sir?
What does a guy wear to an afternoon tea?
Well, it all depends, sir.
The best tailors have agreed that...
Come on, I ain't got all year.
What does a guy wear?
Well, I was about to remark, sir...
...that a cutaway coat, white waistcoat...
...and striped trousers are usually acceptable.
Can I have them by tomorrow afternoon?
That's impossible, sir.
I'll need at least a fortnight...
Look, buddy, I'm on the spears.
I've gotta have it by tomorrow.
I'll pay you double, triple the regular price.
Will you step into the fitting room, Mr...?
J.F. Ahearn.
I'm stopping at the Biltmore.
Call them up.
Follow me, sir.
Oh, Winterbottom, come here.
- Please take Mr. Ahearn's measurements.
- Right-o, Mr. Charteris.
- Excuse me, please.
- Well, let's make it snappy.
- My dinner suit ready?
- It is, Mr. Cass.
- Can I have it tonight?
- If you're prepared to pay something.
Oh, listen, Charteris, old man,
I expect a check any day now.
Now, I'll pay you just as soon as...
I've listened to your excuses for the last time.
When can you pay me, you may have it, and not before.
Excuse me, please.
I'd greatly appreciate it, sir, if you would stand still.
Now, you wouldn't ask an artist to paint your picture...
...while you were fidgeting about.
Oh, wouldn't I?
You don't know me, Winterbottom.
Oh.
Mr. Ahearn's bank references are excellent, eh?
A millionaire? Well, that is gratifying.
And where's the gentleman from?
Oh, I see. Well, that accounts for his strange manner of speaking.
Thanks very much, old boy.
Were you talking about Ahearn, the polo player from Meadowbrook?
Mr. Ahearn is from Chicago.
[CHATTERING]
[PIANO PLAYING]
[CROWD APPLAUDING]
Oh, how do you do, Miss Cass?
- Hello.
- I, uh...
I accepted your kind invitation.
It's nice of you.
Oh, you're the man who drove me home.
Yes, the man from St. Louis.
No, Chicago.
Of course.
Come on in and meet everyone.
This is Sylvia Townsend,
Mrs. Ingram, Dr. Abbott.
- How do you do, doc?
- How do you do, sir?
Oh, uh, what's your name again?
Bug... Mr. Ahearn.
Mrs. Frotingham, may I present Mr. Ahearn?
Mrs. Handley, Miss Ames,
Chauncey Cook, Mr. Ahearn.
How do you, Mr. Cook?
BUGS:
Very distingué, I'm sure.
POLLY:
Dave Winters, Mr. Ahearn.
Miss Cramont, Miss Lovering,
Mrs. Terhune, Mrs. Holman...
...Mr. Sanders, Miss Cartwright.
- I'm very pleased to meet all you folks.
- Just make yourself at home.
- I'll be back in a minute.
- Thanks.
Oh, Miss Cass?
- Here you are.
- Oh, thanks.
Just help yourself to anything else you want.
Yes. Oh, thanks.
[PIANO PLAYING]
[CHUCKLES]
Yeah, looks good. Ha-ha-ha.
Just what I wanted too.
Who is that terrible creature, dear?
He's the comic valentine who gave me a lift when my horse ran away.
His name's Ahearn.
Ahearn? From Chicago?
Yes, why?
He's not so stupid. He's a millionaire.
Are you sure?
I heard the tailor call for bank references.
You bad girl.
Why didn't you say something?
I've never even met him.
Probably got a wife and seven kids.
Well, just the same, he's worth investigating.
Let's meet him.
- Mr. Ahearn.
- Oh.
Mother, may I present Mr. Ahearn?
- Charmed.
- How do you do, madam?
Father, Mr. Ahearn.
- It's a very great pleasure, sir.
- Well, same here.
And my brother, Gordon.
- Glad you could drop over.
- You and me both. Ha-ha-ha.
You should have brought
Mrs. Ahearn along.
Well, that would be great, only I'm not married.
- Congratulations.
- Yeah. Ha-ha.
I understand you're from Chicago,
Mr. Ahearn.
- A favorite city of mine.
- That's right.
Dear old Chicago. I love it.
Connected with Continental and Commercial Bank, aren't you?
Well, I'm not in business anymore.
You see, I made mine and quit.
Yeah, all I do now is just play and enjoy myself.
I suppose you're staying at the Biltmore.
Well, I was, but, uh,
I've sort of bought myself an estate.
How thrilling.
Whereabouts is your house?
Well, I, uh...
I haven't been living here very long, so I don't know the names of the streets.
Perhaps it's one of those big hillside places south of town.
- Yeah, that's right. A big hillside place.
- Grand.
Well, Mr. Ahearn, now that you've found the way...
...I hope you'll come and see us very, very often.
Come to dinner sometime, anytime.
Just give us a ring.
Well, I'm much obliged to you.
And you folks have gotta come and have dinner on me...
...just as soon as I get open.
We'd be delighted. That will be splendid.
Now, remember, Mr. Ahearn, this is not one of those indefinite invitations.
Oh, I should say not.
We expect to see a lot of you.
Thank you.
Say, uh, your folks certainly got a lot of culture, Miss Cass.
They make a fella feel right at home.
You made a very good impression on them.
- Honest?
- Cross my heart.
Well, of course, it's...
I like it that they like me and all that...
...but it's a lot more important to me if you...
I mean, if I... If we...
No, thanks.
Hmm?
I got mine already. Thanks.
[LAUGHING]
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Oh, good morning.
Say, have you got a hillside estate?
You know, something big, kind of rich-looking.
Do you want to buy or rent?
Well, I'll rent it for a while, and then if everything's okay,
I'll buy it.
Well, I think I have just the place you're looking for.
If you'd care to drive out,
I'll show it to you.
- Can we do it right away?
- Yes.
All right, let's take a gander at the joint.
You could put the whole Cubs' ballpark in the front yard.
Yeah, no fooling.
- The polo field is over there.
- Yeah.
And the tennis courts and swimming pool and sunken gardens are this way.
Who sunk the garden?
BUGS:
Say, what's that?
RUTH:
Why, it's a sundial.
What's it for?
- You tell time by it like a watch.
- Ha-ha-ha.
Well, imagine lugging that around in your vest pocket.
I want you to see the...
Yeah.
- This is the living room.
BUGS: Hmm.
Nice chandelier.
- The piano is a Steinway.
- Oh, lovely.
Say, who's that?
- That's a famous Siamese Beauty.
- Where's the other one?
- What?
- I always thought they was twins.
Well, there's a guy in good shape.
RUTH: That's a reproduction in bronze of an ancient Greek wrestler.
Oh, yeah, I know. Zbyszko.
Say, I seen him wrestle Strangler Lewis at the old Garden.
Yep, nice place.
Little big, but cozy at that.
How much are you asking?
Well, uh, let's say 1500 a month on a year's lease.
Fifteen hun?
How would 1450 do?
- Well...
- It's a deal, 1450.
- When can I move in?
- Whenever you want, Mr. Ahearn.
I'm in now.
- I'm sure you'll be very happy here.
- Get a load of the carpets.
Yeah, they make me feel like
I was in wading.
Of course you brought your own servants?
Servants?
Oh, no, uh...
No, you see, I gave them up when I closed my townhouse in Chicago.
Oh. Well, you'll need a housekeeper, and a cook, two butlers...
...an upstairs maid, three gardeners and a couple of chauffeurs.
Is that all?
Well, that's the staff that we, uh...
The people who lived here kept.
Oh.
Mr. Ahearn,
I could get you their servants.
Competent, trustworthy, efficient help.
They know exactly how this place should be run.
All right, sister. You take care of that, but don't let's lose no time.
Oh, look here.
- You know this town good, I suppose.
- Yes, I've lived here all my life.
Well, I'm kind of a stranger around here, but I expect to do a lot of entertaining.
Could you stick around here and help me?
You know, tell me who to invite and all that sort of thing.
Why, of course.
Well, would 100 bucks a week interest you?
It certainly would.
Well, then it looks like you go with the house.
Oh, Mr. Ahearn,
I can't thank you enough...
Oh, that's all right, sister, that's all right.
I'll get my money's worth out of you.
They're very kind, but a little eccentric.
So you mustn't be surprised at anything they do or say.
Most important of all,
Mr. Ahearn is not to know...
...that this is my house, or that all of you worked for Father and me.
- You understand that, don't you?
ALL: Yes, ma'am.
If he did find out, it might be very embarrassing for him.
He might even discharge me, and I need my salary just as much as any of you.
It's gonna take every cent of the money
I get to pay my back taxes and interest.
Boy, what a crib. What a crib.
- Kind of gives you ideas.
- You think not.
[PHONE RINGS]
I'll take it.
Hello.
Oh, hello, Miss Cass. Got my message?
Yes, I called you the minute I came in.
Would you like to come over and have lunch with us tomorrow?
Fine.
Oh, Mr. Ahearn, you're getting me all of atwitter.
Oh, I'm not kidding. I mean it.
Well, I'll see you about 1 tomorrow, huh?
Goodbye.
How you doing, pal?
Well, looks like I'm in the bag, headed smack for the society column.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
AL:
Come on in.
- Is your room all right, Mr. Ahearn?
- Oh, perfect.
The butler will be up to help you unpack.
Thanks.
Now, if there's anything you want, why, please just ask me.
Say, now, look here.
You know, I was thinking we might throw some kind of a party tomorrow night.
- A housewarming?
- Yeah, that's it.
- Will you take care of it?
- Of course.
- Uh, whom do you want me to invite?
- Well, the...
The Cass family.
The Donald Hadley Casses?
That's right. Swell people, ain't they?
Ha-ha.
Charming.
I sure hope they'll accept the invitation.
Oh, I'm inclined to think they will.
Now, let me see, now, there's Miss Polly Cass...
...there's Mr. and Mrs. Cass, and there's young Cass.
Well, the Casses.
And anybody else you might think would fit in them with them.
- Well, they may be a little difficult.
- Yeah, that's right.
You can't invite a lot of tramps on the same party with them.
You know, they're very distingué.
Very what?
[SPEAKS IN FRENCH]
It means, uh, distinguished in French.
Oh, of course, how stupid of me.
- I'll attend to everything, Mr. Ahearn.
- Thank you.
You know, there's a smart little dame.
And plenty pretty too.
Sure, but she's only a servant.
Oh, yeah. Say, I keep forgetting.
Mr. Daniels, you're getting real Scotch, genuine White Horse.
Your horse has got diabetes.
[CHATTERING]
[MUSIC PLAYING]
Lovely night.
Oh, yeah, it's a gorgeous moon.
You going to the polo matches tomorrow?
Oh, yes. Yes, indeed.
You know, you ought to take up polo.
I guess I should.
Oh, it's a grand game.
And I've always had a weakness for athletic men.
[CHUCKLING]
- Let's take a walk, shall we?
- Okay.
Gee, Polly, but your hair smells nice.
Like this perfume?
Coming up for air.
Mind if I make myself comfy?
Go on, don't stop.
Heh.
You, uh, engaged or something to that Mr. Stanley?
Of course not, you silly.
- He's just an old friend of the family.
- Oh.
I got a hunch he ain't gonna be with us long.
As a matter of fact,
I'm fed up with these usual people.
I could do with a new, exciting romance.
Life is very dull.
Oh, you can clean up tomorrow, boys.
Go to bed. You've had a tough night.
- Party come off all right, Mr. Ahearn?
- Oh, yeah, perfect.
Thanks for taking care of everything so good.
- Go to bed.
- Good night.
Hey, wait a minute.
Come here.
Sit down.
Say, you're a good, levelheaded kid...
...and you look to me as though you could keep a secret.
I wanna ask you something.
Get the woman's angle.
I'm...
I'm in love with a girl. A lady.
Say, rich, fine family, swell education.
- Everything that I ain't got.
- I see.
Well, anyhow,
I'm a pretty tough mug, myself.
I came from the gutter and I guess you can still smell it on me.
The only school I went to was reform school.
You've done wonderfully to get where you are now.
Oh, yeah, I've done great.
Sure, a real lady ought to jump at the chance of tying up with me.
Say, do you know who I am, sister?
- I'm Bugs Ahearn.
- Bu...
Bugs Ahearn? The beer...
Yeah, that's right. The beer baron.
The guy who pushes them around Chicago.
Sure, I've quit now...
...but bombing, stealing, bribing, slugging, you name it and I done it.
You, the terrible Bugs Ahearn.
Well, she don't know this, see?
And it's a cinch she's gonna get the dope on me sooner or later.
Now, look here, do you think I ought to give her this whole load myself?
You know, tell her I done a stretch in Joliet...
...lay all my cards on the table?
I got a hunch she'd toss me out and get the whole joint fumigated.
Have you known her long?
Well, I only met her a couple of days ago.
Well, I'd keep quiet about my past for a while if I were you.
Build yourself up to her level.
Then when you've proven...
...that you have all the qualities that she admires in a man...
...then tell her everything.
Well, that would take a long time.
Not too long.
A few weeks. A few months, maybe.
But you'll be improving yourself.
Meeting people...
...and making yourself familiar with your surroundings.
Yeah.
Yes.
Say, you're one of the smartest little dames...
...I've ever run across.
That's right.
Why not?
Yeah, build myself up to her...
Say, you're all right, you know that?
[CHUCKLES]
That shouldn't take long.
He's certainly trying hard to learn the game.
You've got to give him credit.
Out here five hours a day, and seven days a week.
He swings just like an old lady beating a carpet.
Come on, quit stalling. Hit it.
The handle is too long.
You'd be more at home with a blackjack.
Scram, will you, before I wrap this mallet around your neck.
[GRUNTING]
You can have them for 1000 apiece.
The finest Argentine ponies.
Oh, I don't need them.
This dog of mine is good enough to stick-and-ball around...
Hey, your stick-and-ball days are over.
You're really gonna play.
- You kidding?
- No.
The boys say it's a miracle the way you've caught onto the game.
They want you on their team.
Me? On the Meadowlarks?
Yeah, they said if you'd get yourself well-mounted...
Well-mounted?
Say, are these the best nags money can buy?
Absolutely.
- Will five be enough to start with?
- Well, you can get a few more later on.
Me, on the Meadowlarks.
Gee, that's the biggest boot
I ever got in my whole life.
- Can I have them right now?
- Sure.
Sold.
[CROWD SHOUTING]
Why does he carry a mallet?
He hasn't used it since the game began.
MAN:
Mike, what are you stopping for?
Leave it.
MAN:
Come on.
Leave it.
MAN:
One more down.
Leave it.
Nuts!
MAN:
Outside.
[CROWD SHOUTING]
[WHISTLE BLOWS]
[CAR HORNS TOOTING]
"Noted sportsman." Did you pipe that?
And right smack at the head of the society column.
I suppose you'll buy a plane next.
No, they hit the ground, and then where are you?
If we're going out on that boat tomorrow,
I'll buy a pansy motorman cap.
Say, time for you to play golf.
- Oh, I played yesterday.
- Come on, get moving.
You'll become a gentleman if it kills you.
Oh, all right.
He's just an anchor.
I have to drag him around all the time.
This just came from the jeweler's.
Oh, fine. I've been waiting for it.
Oh, boy. Heh, heh.
Boy.
[CHUCKLES]
Say, do you think Polly would like this?
I mean, Miss Polly Cass?
Polly Cass?
You're engaged to...?
I ain't proposed to her yet, but I'm gonna do it tomorrow on the yacht.
Oh, you can't really be in love with her.
Why, just thinking about her,
I break out in a rash.
I can't eat. I can't sleep.
Just think of it, a guy like me.
A guy that's hung around all corners.
A guy hep to everything, falling in love with a dame and on the level too.
Well, I wish you luck.
- Hey, Ruth.
- Hmm?
You don't mind my calling you Ruth, huh?
Well, look here, you know, I'm, uh...
I'm kind of a sucker at this proposal racket.
How do you get started?
How do you get away from the barrier, huh?
Do you mean to say you've never proposed to a girl before?
Well, up to now, I got along all right without even mentioning marriage.
[CHUCKLING]
Well, it's perfectly simple.
Just ask her.
Oh, I'm sure to get all jazzed up.
Could I, uh?
Could I sort of, uh, practice on you, huh?
Why, uh... Why, yes, of course.
Oh, you're a real pal, baby. Ha.
Well, put her down there.
Uh...
Make out like you're her.
Uh...
Well, I, uh...
Well, how do you get going?
Sit down here beside me.
Yeah.
Maybe I better start off with the ring, huh?
No, no, she might not accept you.
You'll have to say something first.
Yeah.
That's where I'm a cinch to get all jazzed up.
Well, just tell her that you love her.
Okay.
Well, here we go, laughing and scratching.
Heh, heh. Yeah...
Well, now, look here, honey.
You know, ever since the first time
I got a gander at you...
...I knew that you and me...
I mean, that we was kind of...
Oh, I'm sunk.
I can think of the words, but they just won't roll out.
Well, just be natural.
Don't try to make a speech.
Now, try it again.
Yeah.
Polly, I...
You know... Now, get a load of this, see?
No, no, no.
You're gonna make a speech again.
Take my hand.
- Put your arm around me.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Maybe I could put it all in a telegram.
Now, tell me that you love me.
I love you.
"And I love you, Jim."
She'll say.
Say, you do this too good.
You must have had plenty of practice.
Now, never mind that.
Ask me to marry you.
Would you? Would you marry me?
Of course I will, darling.
Say, how do you know she'll say that?
Now kiss me.
Good evening, commodore.
What's good about it?
Why don't you suck a lemon?
Suck one yourself, you silly-Looking...
Come on, honey.
Let's go and tell the folks.
I'd better stay here and calm down.
You go tell them, darling.
[PIANO PLAYING]
[CHATTERING]
Hey, folks, say, I got some great news for you.
Kind of a surprise.
Polly and me...
Well, we're engaged.
Oh, Jim, dear. I'm so happy.
[ALL LAUGHING AND CHATTERING]
Isn't that wonderful?
- Good luck.
- Thank you.
- Congratulations, old man. Best of luck.
- Thank you.
Congratulations, Jim. I thought something like this was in the air.
Thanks, Gordon.
Ain't I the lucky guy, though?
Stop sulking.
I only have to live with him long enough to get alimony.
And what am I going to do while you're on your honeymoon?
[CHUCKLES]
You big baby.
Well, now that I'm getting married...
...I'd like to settle down and go into some good, high-class business.
An admirable idea, my boy.
What line should I go in, you think?
Ordinarily, we might find something for you to do...
...around Cass-Winter and Company.
But things have been so slow lately.
Well, I could put in some money.
You know, sort of buy a partnership.
We don't need it, Jim.
See, we're very old and well-established.
Plenty of capital.
Well, that's just the kind of outfit
I'd like to hook up with.
Mm, I don't think I could get my partners to even consider it.
But we'll take a run down to Los Angeles tomorrow and chat with them.
I may be able to convince them.
I hope so.
I tried to borrow money on these bonds to pay my taxes.
And the bank laughed at me.
Why, these are all I've got.
My life savings.
And the bank says they're worthless.
True, bonds have defaulted their interest.
But I think you're unduly alarmed.
I'm alarmed?
I'll show you how alarmed I am.
You sold me these for 5000.
I'll sell them back to you for 500.
I've been fleeced and victimized and I'm going to the district attorney.
Now, Mr. Burger, don't you realize that any adverse publicity...
...would only depress these bond values further?
But, gentlemen...
...if I have faith enough in this young man's ability...
...to sell him my interests outright...
...I don't see how you gentlemen can object.
I have always gloried in your confidence and enthusiasm.
We have stood shoulder to shoulder...
...in fair weather and foul, at our respective posts.
But there comes a time when young blood must supplant us.
When youth must be served.
Now, here is a man, a young man, with those attributes...
Oh, Mr. Cass, could I see you a moment, please?
Oh, will you pardon me, gentlemen?
It's getting very tough out there.
When you leave, go out the back door.
Now, as I was saying, gentlemen...
...here is a young man possessed of those attributes...
...honesty, energy, integrity...
...that alone can carry on the glorious tradition...
...of Cass-Winter and Company.
Now, gentlemen, all in favor of selling their interests to Mr. Ahearn...
...will signify by saying, "Aye."
ALL:
Aye.
Those opposed? None.
Congratulations, Mr. Ahearn.
Well, thanks. Ha.
Well, I...
I hardly know what to say.
I wanna thank all of you gentlemen for letting me in on this.
I appreciate your sacrifice... but at the same time,
I ain't overlooking that it's a great chance for me.
I wanna thank you for all that you done on my behalf.
- I'll guarantee you plenty of service.
- Yes.
Somebody give me a cocktail.
We're celebrating.
- His checks cleared?
- Yes, my boy.
And I made over $300,000 on the deal.
Oh, Father. It's all too wonderful.
Then I don't have to marry him.
- What a godsend.
- Yes, sir.
Mr. Ahearn is now sole owner of Cass-Winter and Company...
...and he is welcome to it.
Where's Papa's cocktail?
And all I could sell him was a few horses.
Ha. I must be losing my grip.
You've got 15,000 commission for selling him that boat.
Oh, cigarette money.
Go on, call the gentleman up and tell him we've got smallpox.
We don't have to endure him now.
He might get suspicious.
You can endure him one more evening.
What excuse will you give for breaking off your engagement?
I'll just write him I changed my mind.
Don't forget to send him back his ring.
Don't be ridiculous.
It's worth at least $5000.
Polly, I'd be careful about the way you break off your engagement.
- Why? His checks have cleared.
- Yes, I know.
But it might be more convenient if you handled the situation delicately.
- Until we can get away to Europe.
- All right.
I've had a nervous breakdown.
You have to take me away for a year.
That sounds plausible enough.
It's pretty sudden.
What if we told him there was insanity in the family?
JOHN: Hey, everybody.
- Hello, John.
John, I have something to tell you.
- Now, wait a minute. Wait.
- Now, John...
I just happened to pick up a copy of TIME.
- Look at this.
- What is it?
Good heavens.
The notorious Bugs Ahearn.
"Beer, blood and machine guns." Huh.
We're sitting on a keg of dynamite.
- Do you think there will be trouble?
- He's the toughest desperado.
He'd think it was a joke to blow up this house.
- Bugs Ahearn.
GORDON: We should've investigated.
It's too late now. We're in danger.
He's sure to find out we trimmed him.
Probably knows it now.
There's only one thing to do.
Get out of the country, quick.
You're absolutely right.
We'll make plans to leave in the morning.
Ingleby. Oh, this is an outrage.
Ingleby, when Mr. Ahearn comes, say we're not at home.
We're indisposed.
We're not at home to anybody.
Mr. Ahearn is here, madam.
His car just turned into the drive.
Good evening, folks.
- Glad to see you, Mr. Stanley.
- Thanks.
Hi, Gordon.
Well, how goes it, Pop?
And, Ma, you're looking keen tonight.
Well, sweetheart.
What's the matter?
I don't feel very well.
A little dinner will be good for what ails you.
- I'm sorry, but I can't go out tonight.
- See, now, look here.
I got tickets for the dog show, but if you're not feeling well...
...we can all sit here and have a nice, quiet evening at home.
I'm sorry, but I...
You'll have to excuse me.
[SOBBING]
I was...
What is this all about?
What's the matter?
Why, we've just heard something rather disturbing.
Something concerning my family's good name and yourself.
I don't get you.
Uh, Mr. Ahearn...
Did you, um?
Did you happen to read this?
DONALD: Of course, it's all a mistake which you can probably explain.
No.
It's true.
What? You don't deny the truth of that article?
I told you, it's true.
And you had the nerve to force your affections on my sister?
Worming your way into our affections, deceiving us about your past...
...so you could marry my daughter.
Of all the disgraceful abuses of confidence.
DONALD:
It's outrageous.
One of the most disgusting insults perpetrated on a trusting, innocent girl.
You've broken the poor girl's heart.
Ruined us socially.
Made us the laughingstock of this community.
My daughter will be ill from the shock.
We shall have to take her abroad immediately.
Now, look here.
I was gonna tell her about myself before we got married.
Naturally, Mr. Ahearn, the engagement is off.
And you are never to come near our home again.
Nor make any effort to communicate with us.
Well...
Well, I know how dreadful you feel.
But it's one of the luckiest things that ever happened to you.
Baby, you sure give me the wrong steer.
All this'd never happen to me...
...if I told her about myself before we got engaged.
All right, we're a bust out here, so what?
Let's head back to where we belong.
- I can't now.
- The trains are still running.
I bought a business.
I gotta stick around and see what's gonna happen to that now.
Say that again slow.
You bought a what?
I got over 600 G's invested in Cass-Winter and Company.
- Oh!
- What's eating you?
That firm, Cass-Winter and Company.
Why, they're thieves, crooks.
- They're what?
- They swindled my father.
Sold him a lot of South American bonds that were absolutely worthless.
It took every penny he had.
It ruined him.
Killed him.
After he died, there was nothing left except this house, which I couldn't afford to live in.
Why, Ruth, you mean to tell me that this house belongs to you?
Of course, ask anybody.
And they took your old man for...
Do you wanna know all about the Casses?
You wanna know the truth about that cultured, charming family?
Well, the old man is a drunken swine.
The old lady cheats at cards.
The son is a nitwit who owes money to everybody who'd listen to him.
Nobody worthwhile around here will even speak to him anymore.
And Polly, she's been a sister-in-law to the world.
Why, she's been in one scandal after another since she was 16 years old.
Yes, and while you were engaged to her...
...she was running around with Mr. John Stanley.
We used to call him John when he worked in my father's stables as a groom.
Why, Ruth, for the love of...
Why didn't you spill all this before?
Oh, I tried to, several times, but I couldn't.
You were too much in love with her.
Say, you sure about that firm?
They've been on the verge of bankruptcy for a year.
And you sunk 600 G's.
[LAUGHING]
The toughest mug in Chicago comes out here...
...and gets trimmed by fags with handkerchiefs up their sleeves.
Wait till Joe Milano gets a load of that.
One more yelp out of you and you go right out through the window.
So they take me, huh? I'm a chump, huh?
Well, that's swell.
I'm the guy who buys Brooklyn Bridge, ever hear of that?
So they're giving me the runaround.
Me, Bugs Ahearn.
Mr. Ahearn, these gentlemen insisted on seeing you.
What do you want?
Are you Mr. J. Francis Ahearn?
What's the beef?
The district attorney would like to see you...
...in his office tomorrow, around noon.
- What for?
- Ever hear of Cass-Winter and Company?
Sure, I just bought it.
That's why the DA would like to see you.
Your face looks very familiar. I think
I've seen a picture of you somewhere.
Never mind the stall.
What's this all about?
Rather serious trouble, I'm afraid.
Your firm's flooded the community with Republic of Santa Rango bonds.
Not worth the paper they're on.
- How can you hold me responsible?
- I don't see why we can't.
I never sold any bonds. I just bought it.
Present records show you to be the owner and president of the firm.
That makes you responsible.
- So that's the law, huh?
- Exactly.
Hmmph.
Look here, supposing everybody that lost their dough got paid back.
Now, that would satisfy everybody.
Can I use your phone for a long-distance call?
Surely. As long as you can pay for it.
I want Chicago.
Central 7808.
[RINGS]
Hello?
Long-distance calling for you, baby.
Yeah, hello.
Say, look here. Get Mike, Tony, Red, Gus,
Hymie, Butch and the other boys.
Shove them into planes and shoot them out to Santa Barbara, quick.
Well, who do you think this is, you fathead?
Sure, it's Bugs Ahearn.
- Look here...
- Don't worry.
I'll save your taxpayers the cost of a trial.
And if I don't make good, you can still have a trial.
Oh, here's for the phone call, sweetheart.
Hey, what state's California in?
- Texas, you dummy.
- That's right.
BUGS:
It's the same old story.
You take a smart guy, put him in a racket he ain't wised up to...
...and he's the biggest chump on earth.
I ain't denying that they took me and they done it good.
I ain't even burned up at them for taking me. Well, not much burned up anyhow.
Because if ever a guy lead with his chin, begged somebody to hang one on it, I did.
All I'm saying is that
I got in over my head...
...and it's up to you boys to bail me out.
I don't have to tell you how to operate.
You know what I want, you'll give it to me.
But be kind of careful about bumping anybody off.
Now, you got all the dough.
Now, don't forget, boys,
I'm depending on you to see me through.
- Okay, when do we cut loose?
- First thing in the morning.
You boys were the best beer salesmen in the racket...
...now let's see how good you are at selling bonds.
[CHATTERING]
MAN 1: Hello, buddy.
MAN 2: Oh, hi.
INGLEBY:
Gen... What?
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Could we speak to Mr. Donald Hadley Cass, please?
The family is leaving for Europe in a few moments.
Mr. Cass is busy upstairs packing and cannot be disturbed.
We wouldn't think of disturbing him.
[GRUNTS]
Come on, step on it.
Why, how did you...?
What do you men want here?
Good morning. I'm Mr. Timothy O'Hara.
- Meet Mr. Pulido.
- Hi.
- And Mr. Zamotoskovich.
- Howdy, gobby.
- You must be in the wrong house.
- We ain't.
We're bond salesmen.
You're gonna buy
Republic of Santa Rango bonds.
Three hundred thousand dollars' worth.
You get out of here before I call the police.
If I were you, I wouldn't argue.
Mr. Zamotoskovich, have you the check handy?
Yes, sure.
Here it is.
All made out. Nothing to do but sign.
This is highway robbery. I refuse.
Looks like we'll have to give the gent a sales call.
Ain't that too bad?
[GRUNTING]
So you won't sign, huh?
Well, you won't sign. Well, how's this?
Stop! Oh, help!
- Stop!
- Maybe this will take a little bit more.
[GROANING]
- Stop!
- You won't talk and you won't sign.
Stop, stop!
I'll sign. I'll sign.
Stop! I'll sign.
- Now you're talking.
- I'll sign it, I'll sign it.
Let me have it.
You'll suffer for this brutality.
This outrage.
You'll regret it. You'll see.
- There.
- Thanks, Cass, old boy.
I'll stroll to the bank and get this cashed.
You boys stay here and entertain our customer.
Sure.
I'm sorry I had to put the heater on you.
But if you sit still, everything's gonna be all right.
It would be too bad to get blood all over this rug.
For a fact.
I want the police, quick.
Hurry up, the police.
We're selling you bonds you sold to chumps.
Operator, I want the police.
They put us in the can for selling them to you, they'll put you in the can.
- You better think it over, buddy.
- Stop squawking, nobody can hear you.
Here, put your moniker on this and be quick about it.
This is an outrage.
Get out of here or I'll call police.
Oh, will you?
Hey, nix, nix.
You don't wanna croak him.
Wait till we get his moniker on this check.
Here you are, kid. Sign here.
Why, this check is for $50,000.
That's all I have in the bank.
Sure, Mr. Ames.
It's bad to have 50 grand just laying in a bank.
Yeah, but it ain't near as bad as getting bumped off, Mr. Ames.
Come on. Put your John Henry on there.
Come on, come on. Hurry up.
Make it snappy.
What's keeping your father? Where is he?
I don't know. I haven't seen him.
If we don't leave in five minutes, we'll miss the train.
But of course, I...
[DOOR OPENS]
MRS. CASS: What do you want?
GORDON: Look here.
- You've got your nerve coming in here.
- Shut up.
Give me that ring. It cost me 7 grand.
Give me that ring.
[SCREAMS]
Now, look here, Ahearn. You can't...
Ingleby, Ingleby. Show these men out.
If you open that puss again,
I'll shove my foot in it.
I wanna slip you a load of good advice.
The next time you go trim a sucker, pick some guy that's a real sucker.
I had smarter people than you doing my laundry in Chicago.
Come on.
Blind, please help the blind.
Help the blind.
Thank you.
How could you pay back all of these losses in such a short time?
A new plan of refinancing.
The Chicago plan.
As long as you put the company on its feet, stay out here and run it.
Oh, no. Out here,
I'm like a mule in a horse race.
Well, look here.
You mustn't judge everybody by the Casses.
They're like poison to everybody in the community.
You telling me?
You haven't met one decent person since you came out here.
Why, sister, that's the first time you've been wrong.
Do you remember rehearsing me in that proposal racket?
Why, of course I remember.
Well, I was thinking it might not be a bad idea if me and you, uh...
...had another rehearsal.
I mean, that is, when you haven't anything else to do.
Well, I'm idle right this minute.
Great.
Put her down there.
MAN:
Fire at once!
[SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY]
Fore!
Look out!
Bull's-eye! Give the gentleman a cigar.
[ENGLISH SDH]
A stall, please.
Ladies and gentlemen... with your kind attention and permission...
I have the honour of presenting to you... one of the most remarkable men in the world.
- How remarkable?
- He's sweating.
And can you be surprised at that, gentlemen?
Every day he commits to memory fifty new facts... and remembers every one of them.
Facts from history, from geography, from newspapers... from scientific books, millions and millions of them.
Think of the strain involved by his prodigious feat.
His feet ain't half as big as yours, Curly.
I'm referring to his feats of memory.
Test him please.
Ladies and gentlemen
Ask him your questions... and he will answer you fully and freely.
Mr. Memory.
I also add, ladies and gentlemen before retiring... that Mr Memory has left his brain to the British Museum.
A question please.
Ladies first.
Where's my old man been since last Saturday?
- On the booze!
- In quod...
Out with his bit!
A serious question, please.
What won the Derby in 1921?
Mr Jack Jools with Steve Donoghue up... won a length at the odds of six to one... second and third Craig and Aaron and Lemonora. Am I right sir?
- Right.
- What won in 1936?
You come back in 1937 and I'll tell you sir.
- How far is Winnipeg from Montreal?
- What won the cup in 1926?
- Cup? Waterloo. Football or tea sir?
- Football, silly.
- When did Chelsea win it?
- 63BC in presence of Emperor Nero.
- What causes pip in poultry?
- Don't make yourself so common.
Well our fowls have got it haven't they?
How many races did Nick the Miller win?
- How old is Mae West?
- When was Crippen hanged?
Who was the last British heavyweight champion of the world?
Henry the eighth.
My old woman...
Bob Fitzsimmons he defeated Jim Corbett... heavyweight champion of America at
Carson City, Nevada in October 1897.
He was then 34 years of age.
Am I right sir?
- How old is Mae West?
- I know, I never tell a lady's age.
- Next please.
- When did the Princess Alice go down?
What causes pip in poultry?
How far is
Winnipeg from Montreal?
- You sir.
- How far is Winnipeg from Montreal?
A gentleman from Canada.
You're welcome sir.
Winnipeg, the third city of Canada and capital of Manitoba... distance from Montreal,
1424 miles.
- Am I right sir?
- Quite right.
How old's Mae West?
How old's Mae West?
Gentlemen, gentlemen please, you're not at home.
What causes pip in poultry?
For God's sake play something man and stop this panic!
Well there we are.
- May I come home with you?
- What's the idea?
Well I'd like to...
Well it's your funeral, come on then, there's a bus.
- You don't stay here always?
- No, I've taken a furnished flat...
I'm only over here from Canada for a few months.
By the way, am I allowed to know your name?
- Smith.
- All right.
Do you want to know more about me?
What do you think I do for a living?
- Actress?
- Not in the way you mean.
- Chorus?
- No.
- Sorry.
- I'm a freelance.
Out for adventure, eh?
This way...
Sorry my sitting room's all upset
I've had the decorators in.
- Wait until I find the switch.
- Not yet.
Now.
Mr Hannay would you be so kind and turn that mirror face to the wall?
You'd be happier if there were curtains over those windows.
- Yes.
- I'm sorry.
Hello, there's the telephone.
Just a minute.
Mr Hannay don't answer the telephone.
Why not?
Because I think it's for me.
Please don't answer.
Just as you say.
Won't you sit down?
Thank you. Would you please kick that footstool over to me?
- You needed that.
- I did. Thank you.
- I owe you an explanation.
- Don't bother about me, I'm nobody.
We cannot talk here.
All right.
Just a minute.
OK?
- Cigarette?
- No, thank you.
- Your friend again.
- Take no notice.
Would you think me very troublesome if I asked for something to eat?
- I've had nothing all day.
- Sure.
- Do you like haddock?
- Yes please.
I suppose your name isn't really Smith.
It depends on where I am.
You may call me Annabella.
Annabella Smith, a clergyman's daughter I'd say.
Hello, nervy.
Upset by those shots tonight?
I fired those shots.
- You what?
- Yes. To create a diversion.
I had to get away from the theatre quickly.
There were two men there who wanted to kill me.
You should be more careful in choosing your friends.
- No you don't understand.
- You don't make it easy.
Beautiful mysterious woman pursued by gunmen... sounds like a spy story.
That's exactly what it is.
Only I prefer the word agent better.
- Agent? For what country?
- Any country that pays me.
- But what is your country.
- I have no country.
Born in a balloon.
Well, we'll let that go.
Now I suppose you're over here to dig up some big state secret.
No I'm here to save a secret from being dug up... a very important secret for this country... not because I love England but because it will pay me better.
You see a very brilliant agent of a certain foreign power... is on the point of obtaining a secret vital to your air defence.
I tracked 2 of his men to that music hall.
Unfortunately they recognised me.
That's why they're after me now.
That was too bad.
Have you ever heard of a thing called persecution mania?
- You don't believe me?
- Frankly, I don't.
Go and look down into the street.
You win.
- Are they there?
- Yes.
I hoped I'd shaken them off.
I'm going to tell you something... which is not very healthy to know, but now that they followed me here...
- you're in it as much as I am.
- What do you mean?
- Have you ever heard of the 39 Steps?
- No. What's that, a pub?
Never mind. But what you were laughing at just now is true.
These men will stick at nothing
I'm the only one who can stop them.
If they are not stopped, it's only a matter of days, perhaps hours... before the secret is out of the country.
Why don't you phone the police?
Because they wouldn't believe me any more than you did.
And if they did, how long would it take to get them going?
These men act quickly. You don't know how clever their chief is...
- clever and ruthless.
- Who is he? What's his name?
He has a dozen names and can look like a hundred people.
But one thing he can't disguise.
This part of his finger is missing.
So if ever you should meet a man with no top joint there...
- be very careful my friend.
- Thanks, I'll make a note of it.
- Meanwhile, what are you going to do?
- First, I'll eat my haddock. Then... if you don't turn me out into the street, have a good night's rest.
You're welcome to my bed
I'll get a shakedown on the couch.
Is there anything else
I can get you?
- A map of Scotland.
- Why Scotland?
There's a man in Scotland I must visit next if anything is to be done.
Are the 39 Steps in Scotland by any chance?
Perhaps I'll tell you tomorrow.
Clear out Hannay.
They'll get you next.
What you were laughing at right now is true.
These men will stop at nothing.
There's a man in Scotland I must visit next if anything is to be done.
It is only a matter of days.
Perhaps hours... before the secret is out of the country.
The police would not believe me any more than you did.
I tell you these men act quickly... quickly... quickly.
Good morning sir. You're up bright and early this morning.
- Could you use a pound note, brother?
- What's the catch?
- I want to borrow your cap and coat.
- What's the big idea?
- I want to make a getaway.
- Do a bunk?
- Yes.
- What have you been up to?
I'll have to trust you. There's been a murder on the first floor.
- By you?
- No. By those 2 men out there.
Now I suppose they're waiting for a copper to come and arrest them.
It's quite true. They're spies.
Foreigners.
They've murdered a woman in my flat and now they're waiting for me.
Come off it. Funny jokes at 5 in the morning.
All right, I'll tell you the truth.
- Are you married?
- Yes, but don't rub it in.
- What's the idea now?
- Well I'm not. I'm a bachelor.
- Are you?
- A married woman lives on 1st floor.
- Does she?
- Yes. I've been paying her a call... and now I want to go home.
- Well what's preventing you?
- One of those men is her husband.
- Now do you see?
- Why didn't you tell me before?
I only wanted to be told.
Trying to kid me with a load of tales about murders and foreigners...
Put this on, put on my little hat.
There you are.
- Take the pound.
- No sir, you're welcome to it...
You'll do the same for me one day.
Leave the pony round the corner.
- So long, old sport.
- Goodbye. Thank you.
The empties.
Papers, magazines, chocolates, cigarettes...
There he is.
For one thing. They're much prettier than they were twenty years ago.
- More free, free and easy.
- You're right there...
I can never understand how people used to put up with the old sort... all bones and no bends.
I will say for the old sort they did last longer.
I dunno, mine last about a year.
Here I'll show you.
Big demand for these now.
- The old fashioned sort.
- My wife.
Now take a look at these.
Our new streamlined model no.1
- What I've been talking about.
- Anything to go with it?
I should say so. This. Put a pretty girl inside those... and she needn't be ashamed anywhere.
- Bring it back to me when it's filled.
- I will.
Hello, what's this? Edinburgh,
Waverly. We're getting on.
I hope you'll pardon us for talking business sir.
Certainly, certainly.
- Good day, sir.
- Good day.
- Broadminded old geezer.
- Bet he's very good at charades.
I wonder what won the 2 o'clock at Windsor.
I don't know, let's get a paper.
Say, son, speeka da English?
Dispatch.
- Hello.
- Well, what won it?
There's been another woman murdered in a West End flat.
- What?
- Woman murdered in West End flat.
Oh these sex dramas don't appeal to me. What won?
- Batchelor's Button, 7 to four on.
- Oh, not so good.
Portland Mansions, Portland Place...
By the BBC. That's a nice place to put someone to sleep.
Goodnight everybody, goodnight.
That's a good one. What was she like?
One of the usual?
A well dressed woman of about 35 with a knife in her back...
- The Tenant Richard Hannay is missing.
- You surprise me.
At 7 o'clock this morning, the charwoman Elisabeth Briggs...
- Well if that isn't the blasted limit.
- What's the matter now?
Is there no honesty in this world?
I ask you. The new Bodyline
Rubber Panty Corset... on sale today. McHutchen Brothers,
Princess St... Price 17/9d...
Brassiere to match 4/11 d.
Do you get that?
The bodyline, 1/3d cheaper than our Streamline...
- no use going to Aberdeen now.
- Might I have a look at your paper?
Certainly.
- Thank you.
- That's all right.
There's enough evidence there to hang any man.
What can I do for you sir?
Can you tell me what station the train stops at next?
What do you think I am, a railway porter? Go and find out for yourself.
- I'll tell you a better one presently.
- You couldn't. That was very funny.
Have you heard the one about the young lady of Onga?
I can't remember them all.
There was a young lady of Onga...
- Taking tea, sir?
- Yes. Thank you.
Darling, how lovely to see you.
Someone having a free meal in there.
I'm terribly sorry, I had to do it.
My name's Hannay, they're after me.
I'm innocent. You must help me.
I must keep free for the next 2 days.
Have either of you seen a man passing in the last few minutes?
This is the man you want, I think.
- But when we passed just now...
- He forced me and told me he was.
- Is your name Hannay?
- Are you coming into tea, sir?
I'll be right along.
Pull that cord!
Go on man, down that end.
Get on with it.
- Why did you pull the cord?
- To stop the train you old fool.
It's against regulations to stop the train on the bridge.
- A man jumped off.
- A murderer, we've got to take him.
- Which way did he go?
- He must have jumped off here.
- I can't see him.
- I can't wait here any longer.
There he is getting on the train.
No that's a passenger.
- It's him I tell you.
- Come on then.
Extra, extra!
About 5 foot 10. small moustache.
Last seen wearing a dark suit... but he may have obtained a change of clothing.
- Good day.
- And to you.
- What'll your business be?
- I'm a mechanic looking for a job.
- You'll find no work about here.
- Are there no big houses round here?
Sir Andrews'. He won't want you. He's had the same chauffeur for 40 years.
- I didn't know there'd been cars that long.
- He was coachman when he was a boy.
Oh I see.
What's that?
That's the Manse but the minister hasn't got a motor car.
Are there no newcomers?
- Aye, there's an English professor.
- Professor?
He lives at Alt Na Shallach, the other side of the Loch.
Would that be anywhere near that village?
- It would.
- Thanks. I'll try there.
You won't try tonight, it's 14 miles.
Do you think I could get a lift in that van?
It's bound the other way.
I guess you're right. Could you put me up for the night somehow?
- Free?
- No, I'll pay.
- Aye. Can you eat a herring?
- I could eat half a dozen right now.
- Can you sleep in a box bed?
- I can try.
- Two and six.
- Take it now. Thank you.
Go in with the gentlemen. He'll stay with us until tomorrow morning.
Your daughter?
My wife.
- Will you not come in?
- Thank you.
Here's your bed.
I'll lift these things.
- Could you sleep there do you think?
- You try and stop me.
You'll be tired?
I'll say I am. Out on the tramp looking for a job.
Sit down please, while
I go on with our supper.
Thank you.
- Have you been in these parts long?
- No. I'm from Glasgow.
- Did you ever see it?
- No.
You should see Saughiehall street with all it's fine shops... and Argyle street on a Saturday night with the trams and the lights... and the cinema palaces and the crowds...
- And its Saturday night tonight.
- You don't get those things here.
No.
Do you miss them?
Sometimes.
I've never been to Glasgow, but I've been to Edinburgh, and London...
I'll tell you about
London at supper.
- John wouldn't approve of that.
- Why not?
He says it's best not to think of such places... and the wickedness that goes on there.
Listen now before he comes back.
What do you want to know?
Is it true that all the ladies paint their toenails?
- Some of them.
- Do London ladies look beautiful?
They do. But they wouldn't if you were beside them.
- You ought not to say that.
- What ought he not to say?
I was just telling your wife that
I prefer the town to the country.
God made the country.
Is the supper ready woman?
- May I look at your paper?
- I don't mind.
- You didn't tell me your name.
- Hammond.
Well Mr Hammond, if you'll put down that paper, I'll say a blessing.
Yes, of course.
Sanctify these bounteous mercies to us miserable sinners.
Oh lord make us truely thankful for all thy manifold blessings... and continuously turn our hearts from wickedness... and from worldly things unto thee...
Amen.
I mind I forgot to lock the barn.
There are police cars coming.
You best be going.
- I was so asleep.
- Don't let them catch you.
I'll never forget you for this.
Which way do I go?
I'll show you.
Aye, I might have known...
Making love behind my back...
Get out. And you too.
Get out of my house before I...
- Aye, go go.
- And leave you like this?
- It's your chance of liberty.
- You don't understand...
You're wrong.
She's only trying to help me.
- To bring shame upon the house.
- To help me to escape from the police.
- The police?
- They're after me for murder.
They're here. She came to warn me.
I told her about it last night.
Don't let them in. Say I'm not here.
I'll make it worth your while.
How much? Have you got that much? Give it to me.
After they've gone.
Get back into the bed.
Shut him in. Hide him.
- No not there. I don't trust him.
- But he took the money.
He couldn't resist it, here...
I was right, he's asking if there's a reward if you get catched.
He'll argue a moment before he lets them in. Now's your time.
Your jackets terrible light coloured
I'm afraid they'll see you.
- You best take this one.
- Is this your husband's coat?
His Sunday best one. But never mind. They mustn't see you.
- What about you?
- I'll say I couldn't stop you.
- He'll not ill treat you?
- He'll pray at me. But no more.
What's your name?
I'll never forget you for this.
There he goes.
Spread out in a line.
- Is the master in?
- What name shall I say sir?
He wouldn't know my name but ask if he knows Miss Annabella Smith.
- Would you wait here while I enquire?
- Yes all right.
We better make enquiries.
Somebody might have seen him.
There's been a couple of cars here.
Murderers don't pay calls in cars.
- Good day to you.
- Good day to you.
Have you seen any strangers about this morning?
There's a few callers upstairs now but they're not strangers.
You haven't seen any suspicious bodies outside the windows or at the house.
No sir. There hasn't been anybody near here for the last half hour.
- You're from Annabella Smith?
- Yes.
We're having a few drinks to celebrate my daughter Hilary's birthday.
Give me 5 minutes to get rid of these people and then we can talk.
Come along and meet my wife. Louisa, another guest. This is Mr...
- I forgot to ask your name.
- Hammond.
Mr Hammond. He's come to see me on business, all the way from London.
There's a police inspector at the door. He wants to speak to you.
The door?
All right, all right.
I'll deal with this.
- Take him in my dear will you please.
- Come on...
This is Patricia...
Mrs Bailley.
Hilary my dear this is Mr...
Hammond, just arrived from London.
How do you do. Forgive the orgy, we've all been to church... the sermon lasted 45 minutes.
This is Captain and Mrs Ogilvie.
Have a drink Mr Hammond?
This is Derek, Derek Stewart...
And this is Sheriff Watson.
You've got to be polite to him.
He's our Sheriff substitute.
Scotch for a local beat.
Give you 6 months hard as soon as look at you.
It's all right don't worry.
I've sent them away.
Come and look at the view from this window Mr Hammond.
We're rather proud of it.
Sheriff, when are you going to catch that murderer?
- What murderer?
- Haven't you heard?
The man who stuck a knife into that woman in Portland place.
- He's in the district.
- How exciting, where?
Somewhere about. On the moors, bridge of Orchy or somewhere.
Why don't you catch him?
You wouldn't like me to be stuck in the back with a knife.
It's not my business.
You catch him and I'll convict him.
- Is there a reward?
- Gracious, it's nearly 1 o'clock.
We must get out of here.
The Professor wants his lunch.
There's no hurry. But if you must go.
Pat, ring for Captain Ogilvie's car.
Whenever you catch him you'll find me at the court at 10 every morning... so bring him along.
Louisa, forgive us, Mr Hammond and
I want to have a chat before lunch.
Now Mr. Hannay. I suppose it's safe to call you by your real name now.
- What about our friend Annabella?
- She's been murdered.
Murdered?
The Portland Mansion affaire.
What are they looking for you for?
- I didn't do it.
- Of course you didn't.
But why come all this way to Scotland to tell me about it?
I believe she was coming to see you about some Air Ministry secret.
She was killed by a foreign agent who was interested too.
- Did she tell you what he was like?
- There wasn't time.
There was one thing, part of his little finger was missing.
- Which one?
- This one, I think.
Sure it wasn't this one?
- Lunch is ready dear.
- I'm coming right away.
Well, I'm afraid I'm guilty of leading you down the garden path... or should it be up?
I never can remember.
It seems to be the wrong garden all right.
- What are we going to do about it?
- That's just the point.
What are we going to do about it?
You see I live here as a respectable citizen and you must realise... that my whole existence would be jeopardised if it became known... that I am not, what shall we say, not what I seem.
Oh Mr Hannay, why have you come here?
Why have you forced me into this difficult position?
I can't lock you up in a room. I've my wife and daughters to think of...
I don't know what to think, really I don't...
What makes it doubly important that I shouldn't let you go is... that I'm just about to convey some vital information out of the country.
Oh yes, I've got it.
Poor Annabella would've been too late in any case.
- Well, that's that.
- Yes, well what about it?
- What about what?
- About yourself...
- It seems there's only one way out.
- And what's that?
Supposing I left you alone, with this revolver.
Tomorrow's newspapers could announce that the Portland Place murderer...
- had taken his own life.
- I thought you were coming to lunch...
We're all waiting.
Will Mr Hannay be staying?
I don't think so dear.
Well, what do you think Mr Hannay?
Well I'm afraid you leave me no alternative.
I can't find my hymn book.
Where did you leave it?
In the breast pocket of my overcoat it was hanging here.
John, I'm afraid I gave it to that gentleman who stayed here that night.
Cigarette cases yes, but I've never seen it happen to a hymn book.
This bullet stuck among the hymns.
Well I'm not surprised, Mr Hannay... some of these hymns are terribly hard to get through.
I'm not complaining Sheriff.
"Hymns that have helped me".
That's a good one, Mr Hannay.
That's fine.
And to think I was drinking his champagne only half an hour before.
It's a lesson to us all, not to mix with doubtful company on the Sabbath.
- How did you escape?
- Look out the window and you'll see.
They put... They body in the dressing room.
When I came to I borrowed this suit and pinched his car.
Sheriff, I don't want to hurry you, but oughtn't we to be taking steps?
This is serious you know. If not, you don't think I'd come to you...
- with a murder charge hanging over me.
- Never heed the murder Mr Hannay.
You'll convince Scotland Yard of your innocence like you convinced me.
All I'll need is a short statement I can forward to the proper authority.
I've someone coming over from the police station to take it down.
- Are you waiting to see me Sheriff?
- Indeed I am.
Do you think I enjoy playing for time with a murderer?
- Murderer?
- Certainly.
Hannay, you're under arrest for wilful murder... of a woman unknown in Portland
Mansions, London, last Tuesday.
Take him over to the jail.
You must believe my story, it's true every word.
We're not so daft in Scotland as some smart Londoners think.
Do you think I believed your story about the Professor?
He's my best friend.
Get me Professor Jordan.
Where did that bullet come from?
From one of your pursuers on the moor. Isn't that so?
I had a shot at him myself.
Let me phone the High Commissioner for Canada in London.
You better do that from London.
You'll be there soon enough.
It'll save you the cost of a trunk call.
That's the Professor's car all right.
Hannay must be inside spilling the beans.
- Stop him there!
- My God!
How do you do?
We're all waiting for you.
Pamela's gone to meet you at the station. This way, this way.
...From our respected leader and standard bearer himself...
I welcome this opportunity to discuss with you another question vital... to the import of our country at this critical and momentous hour.
But first of all, as a preliminary to this, I shall occupy your time for...
- You've occupied too much already.
- We've had enough of you!
Ladies and Gentlemen, I will now call upon the speaker of the evening...
Speak out!
There's no need for me to tell you who he is or speak of his record... as a soldier and statesman, a son of Scotland...
- Speak out!
- The border and conquered England... one of the foremost figures of the diplomatic world in London.
I'm therefore going to ask him to tell you something...
And about time too!
Important to this constituency that at this crucial by-election... our candidate should be returned by an adequate majority.
I now ask for Captain Fraser.
Ladies and Gentlemen, I apologise for my hesitation in rising... but to tell you the simple truth
I'd entirely failed... while listening to the chairman's flattering description... to realise he was talking about me.
For you, may I say from the bottom of my heart with the upmost sincerely... how delighted and relieved I am to find myself in your presence here.
Delighted because of your friendly reception, relieved because... as long, as I stand on this platform...
I'm delivered from the anxieties... which must always be the lot of a man in my position.
When I journeyed up to Scotland a few days ago on the Highland Express... over that magnificent structure, the Fourth Bridge... that monument to Scottish engineering and Scottish muscle... on that journey I had no idea that in a few days I would find myself... addressing an important political meeting, no idea...
I'd planned a very different programme for myself.
You'd be for the moors to shoot something.
Yes, or somebody,
I'm a rotten shot.
Anyhow I little thought that I should be speaking tonight in support of... that brilliant young statesman, that rising, the gentleman on my right.
Already known as one destined to make his mark in politics.
Your future Member of Parliament, your candidate, Mr...
- McCrocodile.
- He doesn't know the candidate's name.
I know your candidate will forgive my referring to him... by the friendly nickname by which he's already known in anticipation... in anticipation, mark you...
Westminster.
Now ladies and gentlemen, we'll discuss some topic. What shall it be?
- The herring fisheries.
- Unemployment.
- What about the idle rich?
- The idle rich?
That's an old fashioned topic, especially for me. I'm not rich... and I've never been idle.
I've been very busy all my life...
- and expect to be much busier soon.
- Have you ever worked with your hands?
Indeed I have, and I've known what it is to feel lonely and helpless... and to have the whole world against me... and those are things that no man or woman ought to feel.
I ask your candidate and all those who love their fellow men... to set themselves resolutely to make the world a happier place... a world where no nation plots against nation... no neighbour plots against neighbour... where there is no persecution or hunting down... where everyone gets a square deal and a sporting chance... and where people try to help and not to hinder... a world where suspicion and cruelty and fear have been forever banished!
That's the sort of world I want.
Is that the sort of world you want?
That's all I have to say, goodnight.
- I did what I could for you.
- You're a difficult man to follow.
- I guess you think you've been clever.
- Tell your prisoner not to insult me.
- You try and stop me.
- Come along.
Couldn't you realise I was telling the truth in that train?
You must've seen I was genuine.
Whether you believe me or not... put a telephone call through to the High Commissioner for Canada... and tell him that an enormously important secret...
An important secret is being taken out of the country by a foreign agent.
I can't do it myself because of this fool detective. Has that penetrated?
Right to the funny bone, now tell me another one.
Haven't you any sense at all?
Put that call through...
I beg you refer them to me.
Will you do this?
No. Goodnight.
I beg pardon Miss but we should like you to come too.
- Whatever for?
- To identify the prisoner formally.
Will you come to the police station?
It's only for a few minutes.
All right, if it's absolutely necessary, lets get it over.
Now you...
- Must I sit next to this man?
- It's just a moment.
Well, be as quick as you can.
Isn't that the police station?
You past it.
You must've misunderstood me.
We're going somewhere else.
- Where are we going?
- To Inverary.
- Inverary?
- Yes.
This man is to be questioned by the Sheriff Principal.
- We've orders to take him there.
- But not to take me.
I'm afraid you must go. You'll be sent back at the earliest moment.
- How far is it to Inverary?
- Forty miles.
Will you keep quiet?
We'll be there in less than 2 hours.
I'm not going to spend the night with you all.
Looks like it.
Isn't he going the wrong way?
That's the way to Inverary.
There's a bridge down on that road. We have to go round. He knows the way.
- Might I see your warrant?
- You shut your mouth.
You'll see it soon enough when we get to the station.
Like to have a small bet with me Pamela?
All right I'll have it with you
Sherlock. A hundred to one that... your Sheriff Principal has the top joint of his little finger missing.
What about it?
I win.
Hello. What are we stopping for?
Oh it's a whole flock of detectives.
They're all over the road, get out there and clear them away.
- What about him?
- I'll soon fix that.
There miss, now you're a special constable.
- What's the idea? What do you mean?
- As long as you stay, he stays.
Yes, and as long as I go, you go. Come on!
Stop them!
They've got away.
- Come on, we must run for it.
- I won't.
See if they've gone down that way.
Where the devil can they have gone?
Help!
Let me go, let me go!
Shut up or I'll shoot you first and myself after.
There's nobody down here I tell you.
Then come up here, don't waste any more time. Spread out and find them.
They must be a mile away by now.
Don't do that.
Oh do stop whistling.
Why are you doing this?
What chance have you got tied to me?
Keep that question for your husband.
I admit you're a white man's burden.
I know and I can't tell you what comfort that gives me.
What is the use? Those policemen will get you as soon as it's daylight.
- They're not policemen.
- When did you find out?
You did it yourself. I didn't known that was the wrong road to Inverary.
They were taking us to their boss,
God help us if they ever catch us.
I see, you're still sticking to your penny novelette spy story.
Of the 20 million women in this
Island I've got to be chained to you.
Listen, I'm telling you the truth.
I told you on the train... and after that election meeting. I'm telling you now for the third time.
There's a dangerous conspiracy and we're the only people who can stop it.
Think what you've seen happen right here under your very nose.
- The gallant knight to the rescue.
- All right.
Then I'm just a plain common murderer... who stabbed an innocent defenceless woman in the back... how do you come out of that? I don't know how innocent you may be... but you're a woman, defenceless and alone on a desolate moor in the dark.
Manacled to a murderer who'd stop at nothing to get you off his hands.
If that's the situation you prefer, have it my lovely, and welcome.
I'm not afraid of...
For all you know I may murder a woman a week.
So listen to a bit of advice.
From now on, do every single thing
I tell you to do, and do it quick.
- You big bully!
- I like your pluck. Come on.
We're going in there.
That's my business.
Now remember what I said, the civil tongue, or else...
We're going in there and you will back me up in everything I say or do.
- Has that penetrated the ivory dome?
- Only just.
Pull yourself together now.
Put your hand in my pocket... and look as if you're in a hurry.
Come along.
Come in man, come in sir.
Oh the young lady's terribly wet.
Yes, we had an accident with our car a few miles back.
- Oh, you'll be staying the night?
- Yes.
We've just the one room left with the one bed in it. You'll not mind that?
No, quite the reverse.
- You're man and wife I suppose?
- Oh yes.
- Yes.
- Have you any luggage?
No, we left that behind in the car.
Well maybe I could lend the young lady a nightgown.
Will you please register?
James, the book.
I'll away up and light a fire.
Will you be needing your supper?
No, thank you. Just send up a large whisky and soda and a few sandwiches.
Oh, and a glass of milk.
I can't write with my left hand my dear but I can shoot with it.
You can guess what's in this pocket.
You sign, the sooner you get used to writing your new name, the better.
Off we go, Mr and Mrs Henry Hopkinson
The Hollyhocks, Hammersmith.
Now dearie, off with that wet skirt,
I'll have it dried in the kitchen.
Oh don't bother. It'll dry in front of the fire just the same.
No doubt the gentleman will take care of you. Good night sir.
- Good night man.
- Good night.
Good night.
- Is he married to her do you think?
- I don't know and I don't care.
They're so terribly in love with each other.
I'm going to tell them the whole story.
You want to hang me for a murder I didn't commit?
So long as they hang you.
Let me go! I'm not going to spend the night here?
Of course you are, what else can you do?
Can I come in sir?
Come in.
We were just getting warm before the fire.
I can see that. I thought maybe you'd like this in your bed, sir.
Thank you. You'd like a hot water bottle my sweet?
- Say "Yes darling".
- Yes darling.
- Very well.
- Please don't go!
Why not?
Is anything wrong?
Of course not, she wants to tell you something that's all.
We're a runaway couple.
I knew it all the time, and they're after you?
You won't give us away will you?
Please.
Of course we will not give you up.
Good night to you both.
You'll not be disturbed.
Thank God for a bite to eat.
Come along. There you are.
- What's next on the programme?
- Get these things off.
Right. How are we going to set about it?
Anything in that bag of yours? A pair of scissors or hairpin or something?
A nail file if you think that'd help.
It'll take about 10 years but we can try.
Now let's make ourselves as comfortable as possible.
What about that skirt of yours?
It's still pretty damp you know.
Don't want to be tied to a pneumonia case on top of everything else.
- Take it off, I don't mind.
- I'll keep it on, thank you.
And that, is that.
My shoes and stockings are soaked.
I'll take them off.
That's the first sensible thing
I've heard you say.
- Can I be of any assistance?
- No, thank you.
Fine.
- Here hold this.
- Yes.
Half a minute.
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.
- Would you like your milk now?
- No thank you. I'll wait a little.
That's better. Now are your feet quite warm again?
- Yes, thanks.
- Well come on.
Will you kindly place yourself on the operating table?
Nobody's going to hurt you.
This is Armistice day.
- Lets get some rest.
- I'm not going to lie on this bed.
You're chained to me, you'll lie wherever I lie...
- we're the Siamese twins.
- Don't gloat!
You think I'm looking forward to waking up and seeing your face?
Unwashed and shiny?
What a sight you'll be.
Give me that nail file.
Lets have a go at this.
Thank you.
I wish I could get that damned tune out of my head...
I wonder where I heard it.
- You sound very sleepy.
- Sleepy! I'll say so.
Do you know when
I last slept in a bed?
Saturday night. Then I only got a couple of hours.
- What made you wake? Dreams?
- What do you mean?
They say murderers have terrible dreams.
Only at first. Got over that a long time ago... when I first took to crime I was quite squeamish about it.
- I was a sensitive child.
- You surprise me.
Used to wake up in night screaming thinking the police were after me... but one gets hardened.
How did you start?
In quite a small way, pilfering from other children at school.
Then a little pocket picking, car pinching, smash and grab... and so on, to plain burglary.
Killed my first man when I was 19...
In years to come you can take your grandchildren to Madame Tussaud's...
- and point me out.
- Which section?
It's early to say, I'm still young.
I'll be in one department or another.
Yes, you'll point me out and say:
"Chicks, if I told you how matey...
I once was with that gentleman, you'd be surprised". What's the matter?
You're pinching my wrist with this handcuff.
Sorry. Talking about Madame
Tussaud's. That's how it all began.
- What began?
- My career of crime... all hereditary,
Great Uncle Penruddock.
Who was he?
Where were you brought up? Never heard of my great uncle Penruddock... the Cornish Bluebeard?
Got it all from him.
I thought your family came from Canada.
No that's where they went after the Penruddock incident.
Murdered 3 wives and got away with it but his third mother-in-law... got the goods on him and tried to have him arrested.
Did she succeed? No.
He was too quick for her.
Took her for a walk to Land's End and shoved her into the Atlantic Ocean.
He's in Madame Tussaud's and there's no doubt about his department.
You must go down to see him sometime.
Can't mistake him...
Third on the left as you go in, red whiskers and a hair lip.
And that lady, is the sad story of my life... poor orphan boy, who never had a chance... are you still set on giving me up to the police?
You're sure everything's going to be quite all right?
Bound to be. He can't have much time.
As soon as I've picked up...
You know what, I'll clear out of the country.
Be careful.
Wire to me.
- Good bye my dear.
- Good bye.
Is that Professor Jordan's house?
Can I speak to Mrs Jordan then?
Is that Mrs Jordan?
Oh, he's gone to London.
I'd like that whiskey hot.
I'll get the hot water.
He dodged down a side street.
The police took the wrong way.
The girl handed him over to us thinking we were detectives.
We had to take her as well because he told her everything.
Very good ma'am, I see.
Yes, ma'am.
- Well?
- The old man's got the wind up.
- He's cleared out already.
- Whatever for?
Thought it too dangerous with Hannay on the loose... he's warning the whole 39 steps.
Has he got the, you know?
Yes. He's picking up our friend at the London Palladium on the way out.
Here's your toddy.
That'll be half a crown.
- And the phone call.
- We'll say a shilling.
- Is this a hotel as well?
- Aye.
- Do you have people staying here?
- Aye.
I suppose you get a few odd people at this time of the year?
Oh, aye.
You didn't happen to have anyone in tonight, did you?
Aye.
They weren't by any chance a young couple, were they?
James!
Mercy me! What kind of a silly creature am I married to?
Want to get us all jailed?
How much did you take for these?
Half a crown.
Out the pair of you. Don't let on that you got a drink here after hours.
You old fool you. You wouldn't have given away a young couple.
Good morning.
What's the idea? How did we get out of these?
You didn't. I slipped out of mine last night... and camped out here.
- Why didn't you run away?
- I did, but as I was going...
I discovered you've been speaking the truth so I decided to stay.
What earthquake caused your brain to work at last?
I overheard those men telephoning.
- What did they say?
- A lot of stuff about the 39 steps.
Go on.
Someone's going to warn them.
How can you warn steps?
Go on.
There was another thing, someone's got scared and is clearing out and...
Oh yes, he's picking up someone at the London Palladium.
The London Palladium?
Is that the Professor? Our friend with the little finger missing.
What does he want to go there for?
I feel such a fool, not having believed you.
Oh that's all right.
We ought to get a move on.
What room are those 2 men in?
No room. They went as soon as they had telephoned.
They what?
- Didn't I tell you?
- You let them go?
- You little idiot!
- Don't talk to me like that.
4 or 5 precious hours wasted.
Why didn't you wake me up?
You should've realised what they said was important.
They've called these men off why not let well alone?
Let well alone? My good girl,
I'm accused of murder.
The only way I can clear myself is to expose these spies.
You still can. He's going to the London Palladium.
First or second house?
I'll get there 5 hours late.
- The show should just about suit you!
- What's that?
Crazy Month!
You're quite right madam.
The Air Ministry has a new thing lots of people are interested in... but they are positive that no papers are missing about it... that would be of any use to a spy.
I'm quite sure. There's a man leaving the country tonight with something.
Since you phoned from Scotland this morning we've made enquiries.
- It's obvious I'm wasting my time.
- Just a moment please.
There's one thing you haven't told us.
Where's Richard Hannay?
I haven't the faintest idea.
- Now look here, you can't...
- You're in the phone book, aren't you?
Well if anything crops up we'll give you a ring. That's all now. Thank you.
Tell Archer and Seagrave to get another taxi and follow that girl.
She'll lead us to Hannay alright.
Cover every exit and on no account let anyone leave the building.
You 2 go in the orchestra pit.
Ladies and gentlemen.
We shall now sing.
No one's allowed to leave the theatre.
Can't a man go out and get a drink?
My seat's in the stalls. I'm looking for someone. May I go through?
She's seen him. She's on her way down to the stalls now sir.
Can I borrow your opera glasses?
Can I take your place please?
What are you doing here?
Listen, he's in that box.
You can't do anything,
I've been to Scotland Yard.
Nothing's been stolen from the Air Ministry.
But you heard those men and there he is.
Shall we take him now sir, or wait until the interval?
What are you going to do?
Nothing's taken and that's the end.
Do you hear that tune? The damned tune I couldn't get out of my head.
Now I know where I heard it before.
That music hall, Annabella Smith.
Ladies and gentlemen... with your kind attention and permission...
I have now the honour to present to you... one of the most remarkable men in the world.
- The same little man.
- Every day... he commits to memory 50 new facts and remembers every one.
Facts from history, geography, from newspapers and scientific textbooks.
Millions and millions of them, down to the smallest detail.
Test him ladies and gentlemen.
Ask him any question...
I've got it. Of course there are no papers missing.
All the information is inside Memory's head.
Mr Memory.
- But I still don't understand.
- Don't you see?
The details of that Air Ministry secret were borrowed and memorised by... and then replaced before anyone could find out. That's why he's here tonight... to take Memory out of the country after the show.
Some gentlemen here would like to speak to you.
A question please, a question please.
- When did Florence Nightingale die?
- What is the height...
- There's something you must know.
- OK, Hannay. Come quietly.
You don't want to cause trouble and spoil people's entertainment.
What are the 39 Steps?
Come on, answer that.
What are the 39 Steps?
The 39 Steps is an organisation of Spies... collecting information for...
Keep your seats.
Keep your seats, please.
There's no need for alarm.
No cause for alarm.
I don't want a chair.
Let me rest here. I'm alright.
Take it easy.
Get the girls on straight away.
The girl's introduction right away.
What was the secret formula you were taking out of the country?
Will it be alright me telling you?
It was a big job to learn it.
The biggest job I ever tackled and
I don't want to throw it all away.
It will be quite all right.
The first feature of the new engine is its ratio of compression... represented by R minus one over R to the power of Gamma.
Gamma seen in end-elevation, axis of the 2 lines of cylinders... angle of 65 degrees.
Dimensions of cylinders as follows.
This device renders the engine completely silent.
- Am I right, sir?
- Quite right old chap.
Thank you sir.
Thank you.
I'm glad it's off my mind at last.
...:::Lord Sadler:::... lordsadler2012@gmail.com
- Morning report, sir.
- Good morning, Mac.
Have you heard anything from A-flight, sir?
Not yet.
Hello.
Hello?
Are you there?
Yes, Major Brand speaking.
Hello? Yes.
No, no, the flight isn't back yet.
You expect to send men out on a filthy job and have them back in no time at all?
What's that?
Next time you'll get someone else to do it?
'What do you wanna get someone else for?'
'Haven't we done every nasty job you can think of?'
If my men can't do it,
I'd like to do who can?
We're the best squadron in France.
Yes and furthermore, let me tell you something.
Hello? Hello?
The vicious, over-dressed brass hat.
Orders, orders.
Thinks the 59th can't do it, eh?
Well, the 59th can do anything he can think of.
It is a slaughter house, that's what it is.
And I'm the executioner.
You're too fond of calling yourself names, Brand.
- 'Now, if I were you--'
- See here, Phipps.
Do you know how many men we've lost in the last fortnight?
Sixteen men, that's what.
Think of that. Over a man a day.
And now there's A-flight out on a rotten show.
Seven splendid chaps.
Three of them first time over the lines.
If half get back we're lucky.
I know it's a rotten job, Brand but you shouldn't take it so seriously.
Hello?
Hello, yes, speaking.
Yes, what?
What?
A-flight? Two enemy patrols?
Who's down?
What? Five men!
What? You can't tell!
Hello? Hello?
You know, Phipps, someone picks up a phone and says "Bombers after a bridge. Protect them."
You say alright. Cheerio.
And send up a flight equipped with inferior planes.
They don't argue or revolt.
They say righto.
Then go out and do it.
They're stout fellas, aren't they?
Bott?
Yes, sir.
Another bottle.
Yes, sir.
Beg pardon, sir.
But you've heard of A-flight, sir?
Yes.
Five.
Five out of seven.
- Alright, sir.
- Alright, mac.
Fine. I'm glad you're back, sir.
- How did you make it, Scotto?
- Thanks, alright.
- And you?
- Alright.
- Hell, wasn't it?
- Right.
- Cigarette?
- Yes. Got a match?
Hello!
Shrapnel.
Almost blew my plane over.
Just five inches from your behind, sir.
Yes. But what a difference five inches made to me.
Oh!
Who did we lose?
Two of the new men.
Blaine and Machen.
There's Hollister.
I'm sorry for Hollister.
Machen was his best friend.
What a rotten war!
Where's Machen?
Have you seen Machen?
Courtney, where's Machen?
Bob hasn't come back.
Bob...Bob didn't come back.
Steady, Hollister, steady.
He..
He isn't..
...gone?
No, no. That couldn't have been Bob.
It couldn't have been Bob.
He never what happened.
There wasn't any pain.
Oh, come on, now, there's a good lad.
Come, come. Come on.
Steady, boy.
'Must feel quite bad.'
I'm alright, sir.
Quite alright.
You better have a drink,
Hollister.
No. No, I-I couldn't.
I'm not drinking.
- Go up with him, fellows.
- Right.
Machen gone West, sir?
Yes and Blaine too.
It's too bad.
First time over the lines too, huh?
- Hmm.
- 'Anything I can do?'
No. I'll be alright.
He's been a bit sick, sir.
Alright, fellas.
Here, Hollister, take this.
You'll find it'll help.
No, thanks. I'm alright.
Go on take it.
Shove it down now.
Bottoms up.
- Feel better?
- Yes, sir.
It does help.
A little later, pack Machen's things.
He didn't have time to unpack.
- Well, Courtney?
- A squad/Escort returning.
We reached the bridge.
The bombers scored direct hits and wiped it out.
- 'Yes?'
- We lost two men.
Blaine and Machen.
Yes, I know.
- That's all.
- Wait a minute, Courtney.
Did you have to do it that way?
Why couldn't you have been more careful?
'You're responsible for those new men.'
Do you think I got into that hiney fleet on purpose?
We were out numbered and forced down low.
We had to fight our way out.
'Yes. I suppose.'
Do you think I enjoyed losing those two men?
Scattering them all over,
France?
Burning them up in worthless planes?
Oh, why don't you say what you're really thinking?
Tell me I am wrong.
Tell me I oughta give you better planes, better fliers.
Blame me for it. Why don't you?
Go ahead.
I'm not blaming anyone, Brand.
You think it's easier to sit and wait for men to come back?
Wait and wait?
You think that's easy?
'Easy to be the executioner?
I know what you're thinking.'
'Don't look at me like that accusing me, I'm not to blame.'
The whole army's on my neck.
This squadron has desperate work and I depend on you to help.
I wish they would chuck that fighting for a bit.
It all started over a girl while they were on leave in Paris.
Just a well you know..
- I know.
- Courtney won.
They've been at each others' throat ever since.
Yes, I know the things are different now.
It's responsibilities that's driving Brand putty.
He's gotten to the end of his tether's scouts.
His nerves are all frayed out.
Every time a kid's shot down he feels he's the executioner.
No, no. No, he doesn't hate Courtney.
He depends on Courtney.
Needs him.
That's why...well..
I better go in before they come to blows.
'I'm your superior officer and..'
I suppose that's all.
Hello? Hello?
Yes, speaking.
Yes. Flight's back and the job is finished.
Blew the whole thing up.
Did you expect us to do any more than that?
Yes.
We lost two men.
Yes. Only two.
Only two?
...and we weren't exactly standing still either.
'I saw you.'
No, I wasn't..
I'll have a whiskey.
Drink all you can, son.
This maybe the last.
What's the devil with a full belly, say I.
I know.
I say, Courtney, do you remember
Griggs at the 37th?
He was killed the other day over at Ellenville.
Wings came off an SC.
Too bad.
I'll never forget him at ground school on his solo flight.
He cracked up plenty of planes after that.
You remember when he pancaked on that house, one morning and found himself hanging upside down staring into the girl's bedroom?
She opened the window and bashed him in the eye.
'Heard of the new motors the French are using?'
- No, I haven't.
- I think I have a final..
'They have a wonderful climb.'
And very costly.
I've got one thing against them.
They're bad in the power dive.
I hear they rip the wings..
I was sittin' there and one of them almost fell on me.
'I don't suppose you would.'
Don't you ever get fed up with that tune?
Oh, why should I?
It's a jolly good tune.
I say, sing us a song, will you?
Yeah, do it, old chap.
Alright, Tommy.

Listen to them out there.
Bluffing themselves.
Pretending that death doesn't mean a thing to them.
Trying to live by just the minute.
The hour.
Pretending they don't care if they go up tomorrow and never come back.
There's one poor fellow who doesn't pretend.
'Who's that?'
Hollister.
He can't forget that his best friend went down in flames.
I saw him out there, a few minutes ago, staring.
Wondering what it's all about.
I'm afraid he's got the wind up.
He'll never fit.
He'll have to learn.
Oh, why talk about him.
I don't want to know his troubles.
Is there an E in "courageously," Brand?
Courageously?
Yes, of course.
I'm just sending a letter of sympathy to Mrs. Machen.
I'm puzzled over that word,
"courageously".
- It has an unfamiliar look.
- Unfamiliar.
Well, you've written it often enough.
'It'll break her heart no matter how it's spelt.'
Hello. Hello, yes, yes, Major Brand speaking.
'Yes.'
Oh, where am I going to get the men to do it?
What? They're on their way up now?
Yes, of course we'll do it.
If any men get back from filthy work like this, they'll be lucky.
Yes, I understand.
Goodbye.
That's rotten, isn't it?
Yes.
Six more men coming up to this hell.
That Courtney's got to take them up.
Courtney.
It's a funny world, Phipps when you can be annoyed into your grave almost by a man.
Yet tear yourself to pieces worrying about his safety.
Oh, I wouldn't say it was so strange, Brand.
It's just responsibility.
Have you seen a mother risk her life to save her child? then spank its bottoms soundly for getting itself into danger?
I've got to tell him to take up new replacements again.
He'll resent it.
He'll just stand there looking holes clear through me while I tell him.
Then he'll say, "Right".
Well, come along, Phipps.
Let's get at it.
Would you mind turning that off, Scott?
Right.
Okay. Quiet, lads.
Attention over there, please.
Orders for tomorrow morning.
Gentlemen, orders for tomorrow.
A flight on the early show over Ballay Sector.
We're making an advance.
'We're to patrol four kilometers behind to the enemy lines.'
'Strafe any reinforcements and munitions convoys.'
'That they bring up for counter attack.'
When the barrage starts,
B Flight will cover our observation ships and artillery.
You'll take up the details among yourselves later on.
That's all.
Did you say A flight?
Yes.
4:30 in the morning.
A flight is only five men.
Well, more replacements are on their way up.
They'll be here sometime tonight.
Are you saying we must go on a job with two inexperienced men?
Yes.
Those are the orders.
Right.
Well, what amuses you?
You win again, Brand.
He said "Right" just as you said he would.
You'll be over the same battery we were this morning.
Someday they'll get our range.
They keep at it long enough.
Undoubtedly.
'Farley, you and the others fly above us.'
He's flying fifth position, you take sixth.
'We'll be watching those observation ships'
'Yes, we better keep--'
'Well, what happened last time on a job like this.'
'That's why you look out on the bow??.'
'Check your ammunition.'
'We've been having trouble with those bugs lately.'
Yes, I remember off hand
I could get a..
We'll rendezvous at here.
- Five thousand feet.
- Five thousand at that.
I just see my own death riding in a chariot of fire.
One more, Bott.
Hey, fellows, look at Scotto.
A few drinks and he falls sound asleep.
Come on, ol' friend.
Wake up. Time to go to bed.
I want to sleep.
'Pick him up.
You'll save time, Courtney.'
Come on, you blighter.
Wake up.
Oh, come on.
Get on your feet here now.
Say goodnight to the gentlemen.
Goodnight to the gentlemen.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
'Tuck him in, Courtney.'
'Tell him a nice bedtime story.'
Splendid, old zealot.
Yeah, now wake up and go to bed.
You're getting heavier all the time.
I always did hate walking up those steps.
I don't know what you want to drink for.
You get as fuzzy as an owl.
Only you can't keep your eyes open.
I know. I always want to sleep.
What's the matter, old son?
Was thinking about Hollister.
I recommend a change of thought.
Pretty rough losing your best friend.
You know, Machen wasn't much older than your brother.
Yes.
Yes, Donnie is 17 now.
If this mess is over by the time he gets out of school.
You remember the time we went up to visit him?
Donnie thought he was quite a man when he had beer with us.
Yes and I remember when he was a baby.
Your mother let me fool him.
I dropped him on his head because he spoiled my new suit.
All that seems awfully far away now.
As if it had never happened.
'That out there is the only thing that's real.'
Wouldn't it be fun if we're back there again?
Imagine waking up in the morning not having a thing to do all day but to enjoy peace and quiet.
And to know absolutely that you..
...you're going to get back in your bed again that night.
Silly, isn't it?
Try a little more coffee, sir?
No, thanks.
Good morning.
Why didn't you wake me up?
After last night I thought you'll enjoy a few extra winks.
Thanks. I did. Oh!
Whoo! What a head.
Thanks, Bott.
New men come up yet?
No, Sergeant's bringing them in directly.
'Alright, gentlemen.
This way, please.'
Here they are now.
Just put your things down and be comfortable.
Look at them, Scotty.
Four youngsters.
Wonder if they brought their nursing bottles along?
New replacements, sir.
Very good, mac.
Well, here goes.
Good morning, gentlemen.
Good morning, sir.
I'm Courtney, skipper of A flight.
Russell, second lieutenant, sir.
Reporting from the pool for duty.
Oh, hello, Russell.
Oh, break off.
No formality here.
Thanks.
How many hours have you fellows had on combat?
- Mr. Burt.
- Nine.
- 'Cleaver.'
- 'Smythe.'
- 'Holloway.'
- 'Russell.'
- 'Blythe.'
- Seven and a half, sir.
Seven and a half.
'Yes, sir.'
I'll take Russell and Smythe.
Get in to your flying tongs right away. Change here.
We're going over the to strafe trenches in the Bullay Sector.
Bott..
Have a drink?
Just make sure it's little, old son.
There's one who does.
Some more glasses, Bott.
Russell? Smythe?
Have a drink?
Thanks.
Scott, Mr. Russell,
Mr. Smythe.
How do you do?
Mr. Thornburn and Mr. Willsy.
'How do you do?'
- Welcome to the flight.
- Cheerio.
'First time over the line, eh?'
Morning, fellows.
- Good morning.
- Morning, Courtney.
New replacements.
I'm taking Russell and Smythe.
This is Major Brand.
- How do you do, sir?
- Hello, Russell.
- Hello, Smythe.
- How are you, sir?
This job isn't easy, fellas.
I want you to follow Captain
Courtney's orders closely.
'You stick to his tail, he'll get you through alright.'
'If you're forced down on the other side, destroy your plane.'
'Don't give any information except your name and Corp.'
Yes, sir.
That's all.
Happy landings, fellas.
- Thanks.
- Let's be off.
Sergeant.
Mr. Russell and Smythe are flying four and five.
Yes, sir.
This way gentlemen.
- Cheerio.
- Thank you, sir.
Oh, Hollister.
You're an old hand now.
We're counting on you.
Right.
Watch him.
Remember, you're protecting the tail.
- Righto.
- Hey, Scotty..
And watch yourself too, old man.
That goes for you too, old friend.
- Good morning, Mac.
- Good morning, sir.
- Flight's alright?
- Tip top, sir.
Contact.
Has the officers got any papers on his person that might give information to the enemy?
Has the officer got any papers on his person that might give information to the enemy?
Happy landing, sir.
Not, Mr. Scott, sir?
He was trying..
Scott was trying to help me.
He got me along and..
...suddenly the Boche came.
He as trying to help me get away and--
Blubbering can't help matters.
You're alright, aren't you?
Well..
We broke up the counterattack for an hour.
Then the Heinies found us.
We lost Smythe...
Wilson..
...and Scott.
- I'm awfully sorry, sir, I--
- Thanks, Bott.
Yes.
Can I do anything, old man?
You can...
Have a drink.
Thanks, I will.
What happened?
Well, after the first barrage, we were.. working under a cloud bank, strafing a convoy.
Focus?? dropped down on us and knocked down Smythe before he could even fire a shot.
I didn't even see Rosie go.
Then Hollister funked.
Got into a jam.
And Scott went after him..
That Jerry and shot him out of control.
Are you sure?
Yes, his tail surfaces were shot away.
He was only a little way below me and..
As he went into a spin, he waved goodbye.
Go ahead and play it.
What does it matter?
And then what, Courtney?
Well, I went bullheaded for the Jerry that got Scott.
I put a bullet in his motor.
Where'd he go down?
Somewhere behind our lines.
Some others got after me.
I was so busy I didn't even see where Scott fell.
I just happened to think..
Scott was wearing those... red polka dot pajamas.
What a shock that'll give the devil.
Alright, bring him in.
Oh, sergeant, you can send that car back.
'Yes, sir.'
- Just wait here.
- Yes, sir.
Major, artillery car just brought in a German aviator.
Where was he captured?
'They say...leader of A Flight brought him down.
'That's you, Courtney.'
Steady, old man.
- Bring him here.
- Alright.
Come along now.
Hauptmann Von Mueller.
Captain Von Mueller,
Major Brand.
'And Captain Courtney.'
Phipps, tell him Courtney is the man that shot him down.
He says he's delighted to meet you.
Ask him if he wants a drink.
Prost.

Don't you know they're dead?

My best friend Machen.
He's dead!
You hear me? He's dead!
Scott.. Scott tried to help me, he's dead too.
'They're all dead!'
'And they're not coming back anymore.'
And you laugh and sing...
Machen and Scott.
Scott!
- You killed Scott!
- Huh?
'Yes, you!
You tried to kill me.'
You tried to kill all of us!
And you... you can drink with him!
You can laugh with him..
You can laugh with the man that murdered your best friends!
'Why you've forgotten Scott already!'
You're forgotten--
You little rotter!
You think that a drink and a song could make me forget?
I'm sorry.
I lost my head.
But you're new up here,
Hollister.
You have a lot to learn.
I know, sir.
I'm sorry.
'You wait out here and I'll be back in a few minutes.'
Cheerio!
- 'Why, it's Scotty!'
- Look who's here..
'Hold on, hold on.
Anybody think of the king.'
Boy, I'm in a delicate condition, wait a minute.
- Hello, Scott-o,
- Hello, son.
You're just in time.
We were celebrating your wake.
Oh, I've gotta be here for that.
Can't have a wake without a corpse, can you?
Tell me.
What in the world ever happened to you?
Well, I got a whole load of bullet.
The last thing I remember was pancaking into a trench and watching my wings fold up.
And then I woke up with a bump on my head...Feel it?
And a stretcher bearer pouring rum down my throat..
We should have some of that rum.
- You didn't take any, did you?
- No, no, just a spot.
But I stopped at all the pubs on the way back.
I brought a surprise for you.
Come on, open them up! and go right on the..
Oh, what's that?
That's the man who shot you down.
The what, the who?
Phipps, introduce them.
How do I get rid of the blighter?
Ask him to have a drink.
Will you have a drink?
- Yeah?
- Yah!
- Goodbye!
- Goodbye.
You're not gonna go and break up your own wake.
Yes. We've got a car and a chauffeur and we're gonna see France.
Hello, Flaherty.
Court, this is Flaherty.
How are you, Flaherty?
Best driver on the western front. Good singer too.
We sang all the way home, didn't we?
You know the words on part of Plum And Apple?
Yes.
Fine.
We'll all sing it together.
♪ Plum and apple apple and plum ♪
♪ Plum and apple there is always some ♪
♪ The ASC gets strawberry jam and rations of rum ♪
♪ But we poor blokes we only get apple and plum ♪♪
Let's sing it again.
♪ Plum and apple apple and plum ♪
♪ Plum and apple there is always some ♪
♪ And rations of rum.. ♪
Beg pardon, sir.
But ain't it time
B flight was back?
Yes, Bott.
'Alright.'
Watch it, pal.
That's right. That's right.
- They winged me, Courtney.
- Too bad, old man.
- I'll take him home.
- Yes, sir.
'What a bloomin' mess they've been in.'
'A nasty mess I calls it.
Like a little rubbish.'
It's a rotten scene, old boy.
Come on now.
Help him out with his things, gents.
- Steady, old man.
- Easy, fellows.
Come on.
Can you move your right arm?
Here you are, Spires.
It'll fix you up.
'What happened?'
We've got visitors, Brand.
'What do you mean?'
I mean, Von Richter's moved in across the line.
- Von Richter?
- Yes.
We ran into one flight, then another.
Suddenly the air was filled with them.
What a mess!
It's lucky any of us got back alive.
'Get it inside the bandage.'
What fliers they are.
We didn't have a chance.
Out numbered, four to one.
They got Thornburn and Barton.
And Hollister.
A damn shame.
Does your face hurt,
Squires?
No, just a splinter from the windshield.
That means blighty for you.
Take him over to the M.O.
Shall I send you back some hops to play with?
Squires..
Tell me, Hollister..
...how did he die?
He was trying to help Thornburn.
He died like a man.
Oh, I'm glad.
I'm glad.
'Get cover! Jerry up!'
...:::Lord Sadler:::... lordsadler2012@gmail.com
Boots?
- Why, George, that's queer.
- What does he want?
Say, Courtney, what is it?
"One pair of trench boots
"for the use of British flying officers.
Signed Von Richter."
Damn him!
- You can give those boots.
- I'll keep them.
- I want them.
- Just a minute, me lads.
'Hold on.'
There's gonna be no voluntary patrols.
Don't you lads realize that those boots are just a trick to get you up into the air?
None of you are gonna commit suicide by going out alone.
You'll die soon enough.
Not a man leaves the ground without my orders.
Understand?
Now, listen to me.
Service both planes.
Rig them up with bomb racks.
Look the guns over extra special.
Don't start before midnight.
And if any of you blokes make a noise or show a light..
...I'll knock your bloomin' heads off.
Understand?
You're going home.
Somebody's gonna get hell for this.
Who from?
The major, of course.
Oh, I thought you meant Von Richter.
Ah, let's hop it and get 'em ready.
- Morning, Mac.
- Everything is ready, sir.
Good.
- Give them hell, Scotto.
- Right-o, son
Beg your pardon, sir.
I've been saving this up since Neueve Chappelle.
Would you mind dropping it on their head with my compliments, sir?
- Alright, Ackroyd.
- Thank you, sir.
Here are the boots, sir.
Thank you, Mac.
Make it quick, sir.
I'm gonna have tea and strawberry jam waiting for you when you come back.
- Happy landing, sir.
- Thank you, Mac.
'Contact.'
'Get down here with those planes, damn you!'
Didn't you hear my orders?
I'll break your necks!
You can keep the boots!
Right here, Scotto!
Take her up, Scotto. Gotta get back to strawberry jam.
Fire!
What's the matter, Scotto?
Can't see.
Oil in my eye.
Get her high!
We're going down!
Alright. We're out of it.
Keep going.
We are almost down.
Wing out. Let 'em hit.
Scott, look out!
Scotto...are you alright?
Yes, I'm alright.
I got you, son.
I can't see. Oil.
Give me something, quick.
Okay, that's better.
Well, we made it, didn't we?
Maybe he's right.
We better go.
You were certainly right about that front-line rum.
Courtney and Scott have just returned.
Came in a French staff car.
'Do you want to see Courtney now?'
Yes. Send him in.
Right.
Courtney.
Wanted to see me?
You think you're gonna get away with this, Courtney, eh?
'Well, you think wrong this time.'
'You disobeyed my direct orders.'
You think I issued them to hear myself talk?
You went out against
Von Richter.
Von Richter, do you understand?
When we're outnumbered four to one.
You fool, we need every man.
Every plane.
And you went out and smashed two of 'em.
I'm gonna have you court martialed for this.
I'm gonna break you out of the Flying Corp.
And when I've finished with you,
Courtney, you'll wish that you..
Hello...yes, speaking.
'Yes.'
What?
Who?
Right.
Right, thanks.
I've got you, Courtney.
I've got you just where I want you.
You've refused responsibility.
Flown wild.
Disobeyed orders. Blamed me.
Accused me of putting kids in canvas coffins, eh?
Well, I've just been transferred up to wing.
'And they've appointed someone in my place.'
- 'In my place, understand?'
- What?
And that someone is going to be you.
And see how you like it,
Mr. Squadron Commander.
Hello? Hello.
Speak louder, will you?
I can't hear you. What?
Well, let the infantry get demoralized
I can't put planes over them.
Six replacements?
Replacements? More kids.
You're making a death house of this place.
Von Richter's squadron just shot us out of the air.
Driven us into the ground.
Killed our best men.
You expect green kids to stop him?
Right, it'll be done. But I tell you, they won't have a chance.
Brass hats, sitting back there on easy chairs and making excuses for sending men up to die.
No use trying to reason with them, Courtney.
Well, how about getting on with this letter.
Where did we leave off?
'"And I can only hope,
Mrs. Blythe, that.."'
I can only hope, Mrs. Blythe..
...it will give you some measure of comfort to know that..
...your son died in combat.
Fighting valiantly.
You know, Phipps, I will never forget that boy.
I asked him how many hours he'd had.
He said, "Seven and a half."
And they keep sending more up like him.
Kids against Von Richter.
'Anything more to add to this?'
No, finish it yourself.
What does it matter?
Come in.
Hello, Carl.
Hello, Scotto.
Court, don't you think you've had enough of that?
That's my business.
Oh..
Sorry, Scotto,
I shouldn't have said that.
I'm getting jumpy.
Nerves aren't what they used to be.
That's alright, old son.
I am rather jumpy myself.
Can't get used to being alone in flight.
I am always wishing that you were along.
Yes, I wish I were too.
Better than sitting here.
Come in.
- What is it, Mac?
- Well, new men outside, sir.
More lambs for the slaughter.
Fix them up, will you, Scotto?
Make them as comfortable as you can.
Right. Come along, Mac.
I'm Scott.
Skipper of A flight.
At ease, gentlemen.
No formality here.
Billing. Second lieutenant, sir.
Reporting from the pool for duty.
Right.
Billings, Moorhead, Gregory go to the first house on your left.
- That'll be your quarters.
- Right, sir.
- Night.
- G'night.
"Ranson, Jones, Ca.."
- Donnie!
- Scotty.
Aren't you glad to see me?
But I...I thought you were in school, old man.
Oh, I couldn't stand not being in it any longer.
So I left and enlisted.
Went through ground school in four weeks.
Oh, that's-that's grand.
Mac, this is my brother.
- Your brother, sir?
- Yes.
Show the other gentlemen to their quarters, Mac?
This way gentlemen.
You always thought
I was a kid, Scotty.
I'm going to prove to you, I am not.
That's right.
You...you are a man...now.
Wait till you see me fly out there.
I passed combat maneuvers perfectly.
Well, that's...that's splendid.
- Is Court around?
- Yes.
Let's go see him later.
Come on,
I-I'll show you your quarter.
Alright.
See, isn't this..
Hello? Hello, yes, speaking.
What's that?
Wait a moment.
Alright, go ahead.
What?
'Yes, go on.'
'Four patrols a day.'
I can't do that.
I can't do it, I tell you.
The lot of green men will be wiped out.
Alright. Will do it.
Right.
Before the week is out, Phipps..
...you'll see the end of Squadron 59.
There isn't an end to anything,
Courtney.
It just goes on and on.
We'll be under everything that flies.
Cold mutton.
Well, ready for orders.
'Yes.'
Settle down, will you?
Gents. Quiet, lads.
Quiet please.
Orders for tomorrow.
Orders, fellows.
There's no need for secrecy.
JHQ has found that Fritz starts the big push day after tomorrow.
They're starting minor advances now.
More patrol in the Mantes Wood sector. opposite the German 6 army.
We'll have to fly four patrols a day.
And every man goes into the air at dawn tomorrow.
'This means you'll have to do all the dirty work.'
Machine gunning infantry. Flying low. Stopping supply trucks.
And any shock troops they may try to bring up.
You will be pitted against
Von Richter.
'You'll be flying below enemy patrols.'
'You'll have to watch out.'
That's all.
Court.
Donnie.
Hello, Court, it's great to see you.
So you are one of the replacements?
Yes. Didn't expect me, did you?
Scotty was surprised too.
Oh, it's great to be up here with you both.
And just think,
I'll go up tomorrow. Won't I?
Yes.
Just a minute, Donnie.
You're not gonna send this kid up in the air?
- Hold on, Scott.
- Hold on nothing.
If you think
I am gonna take him up against Von Richter, you're barmy.
Flier, ground school, he doesn't know what it's all about.
What chance would he have?
As much chance as any of the others.
I'm sorry. It's orders.
We're all on the same boat.
I can't make exceptions.
- But, Scotty--
- Shut up.
I won't take him up.
I said every man in the air.
And you were the one who talked about sending a school--
Quiet!
Those are orders, you hear me?
Orders. Now get out!
Get out, I tell you.
Right.
- But, but--
- That's enough.
You be ready at dawn tomorrow.
That's all.
Yes, sir.
Come in.
Sit down, Donnie.
I am sorry I spoke that way.
Oh, that's quite alright.
I don't think you need to worry about me.
You see, Scotty really doesn't know how well I can fly.
He can't realize that, that I've grown up.
Scotty is right, Donnie.
You learned how to fly.
But things are different up here.
Scotty knows that.
Knows what you're up against.
And I think that you should know it too.
Now, you are going out there against veterans.
Superb fliers like Von Richter.
You've got to be on you mettle every moment.
Remember every trick you've learned.
And, Donnie, if you should lose..
...be a good loser.
Just as you would be in school.
I know what you are trying to say, Court.
You mean, that tomorrow
I may not come back.
That I may die.
That's it, isn't it?
Well, none of us will be here long, Donnie someday I'll go just like the rest.
But it really isn't so bad if when you go you know that you've done all you could to help.
Oh, it would be splendid to go like that.
I'm not afraid, Court.
Really. I'll come back.
I can fight better than you think.
Right.
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
Oh, I say..
...perhaps I'd better leave this with you if you don't mind.
In case anything should happen.
'I got it for being on the crew last year.'
Silly, but it's rather precious to me.
Of course.
Thanks.
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight, Court.
Fly in second position on my right.
Stick close, Donnie, and I'll try and get you through.
Don't worry.
I'm not a bit afraid.
Really, you watch me.
I can fly better than you think.
Good, boy. Cheerio!
In you get.
'How many, Phipps?'
Three.
No, Donnie.
Donnie, no!
Donnie, no!
Donnie, no, no, no!
Two?
The match was wrong, Phipps.
Yeah.
He's dead.
He's dead.
Went down in flames.
'You sent him there, you dirty butcher!'
- Scott-o--
- 'None of that, Courtney.'
From now on you're just a drunken sack/sap?? in command.
You sent that kid up there without a chance.
You even told him how to die.
How rotten.
Told my brother how to die.
Scotty!
- Hello, Phipps.
- Hello, Brand.
Is it really you?
By again!
You're looking a new man.
Thanks. I feel like one.
- I missed you, Phipps.
- Very nice of you to say that.
Courtney inside?
- Yes.
- Right.
- This is Mr. Sterling, Phipps.
- Hello. How are you?
How do you do?
Come in.
Hello, Courtney.
How are you, Brand?
'Fine, thank you.
It's nice to see you.'
Pull up a chair.
- Have a drink?
- Thanks. I will.
That's enough.
Well, the place looks about the same.
Yes. About the same.
I never expected you wanted to see it again.
What brought you?
'General sent me.'
Oh! Then I can expect some pleasant news this time.
Well, what is it?
You've been having a rotten time, Courtney, haven't you?
I know exactly how you feel about it.
The old man says that you've been raising the very devil objecting to his orders.
This job is far too important to talk about over the phone.
What is it?
The enemy start their big push day after tomorrow at dawn.
Now the ammunition and supplies have been concentrated at railhead at Sule.
And the destruction of that railhead will stop their drive.
'And it's up to your squadron to destroy it.'
Well, you're barmy, Brand.
Sule is 60 kilometers over the lines.
If four flight got half that far the whole German Air Force will attack.
Right! A flight couldn't make it.
It's up to one man, to go in alone, at dusk.
You've to take a chance on getting there before they can stop it.
- I say it can't be done.
- 'It has to be done.'
The man who goes will set a dog's chance of getting back.
'Then you refuse?'
Well, there's no refusal.
I'll go myself.
Sorry, Courtney.
You're chained to this desk just as I was.
You better ask for a volunteer.
'Here are the instructions.'
Right.
Gents..
Carry on.
Fellows..
...the enemy has concentrated munitions for the advance in a dump, 60 kilometers behind the line.
Our squadron is ordered to destroy it.
Now, there's no chance for a flight to get through.
'One man flying low, hedge-hopping might succeed.'
'The chances are ten-to-one that he won't come back.'
I'm not going to order anybody to do this job.
I want a volunteer.
- That job's mine.
- I'll take it.
- I'll fly, Courtney.
- Let me have it.
I spoke first, Courtney, do I get it?
Right.
You get it.
'Here are the instructions.
Read them carefully.'
You leave at dusk.
In exactly two hours.
Right.
Russell, see that sergeant gets his plane ready.
Yes, sir.
Right out.
Orders.
Orders!
Executioner Courtney.
Successor to Executioner Brand.
Well, you've got your volunteer.
Your job's gonna be done.
But it means that boy out there is going to die.
It means that Scotty is going to die.
Sorry, Courtney.
Yes?
Get out, Courtney!
Like it or not
I'm going over these maps with you.
I know what I am going to do.
I don't need to be told how to die.
I'm in command here.
You'll just sit there and listen to my orders.
I wouldn't drink that if I were you.
You had a lot already.
You can't stand much.
Can't I?
I know how much I can stand.
Well..
Get on with it.
You take this point.
You'll follow through the valley until you hit the railway.
Here.
Then East until you get there.
Now, here's Sule.
The big warehouses are right here at the railhead.
And ammunition are piled in this area here.
A hit anywhere in this vicinity will do it.
Sorry.
The enemy high patrol will be on it's way back at dusk.
You'll have to go in very low to avoid them.
One would think
I were green kid.
First lesson of them flying grounder school.
Your only chance is to reach it before they spot you.
Keep a lookout on the way over.
That place is alive with arches.
They'll phone ahead and you may run into a barrage.
But you'll have to keep on going.
Court...time to go yet?
No, you have a good hour.
I'll wake you when it's time.
- Yeah. Oh, Court.
- Yes?
Sorry. I understand.
Brass hats. Orders.
'I can't go out there still sore at you.'
'Can I?'
Why, of course not.
Now, go to sleep.
Go to sleep.
Happy landings, Scotto.
'Guns are alright, sergeant.'
'Very good.'
Aye, Mr. Scott will find this in good shape.
'Right, sergeant.'
'Sergeant.'
Hello, Mac.
But..
You're not flying, sir.
Yes, Mac.
Going West.
Get busy there.
- 'Switch off.'
- 'Switch off.'
- 'Gas on.'
- 'Gas on.'
'Duck in.'
- 'Contact.'
- Contact.
Happy landings, sir.
Thank you, Mac.
- Any news, Phipps?
- No.
- Have you?
- No.
I've phoned wing headquarters and observation posts at Mantes.
Haven't heard a thing.
We must do something, Phipps.
We must do something!
Steady, lad, steady.
We've dug a trench in the field filled with petrol.
As soon as we hear his motor we'll light it to help him land.
- What more can we do?
- I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Why don't you realize Courtney's out there alone.
Without me. Doing the thing
I should've done.
Oh, God!
Come along, my lad, come along.
We'll wait outside.
We've petrolled the width of the field, sir.
Plenty of light to land by when he comes.
Right.
I'm afraid it's no use, Mac.
'Oh ,don't say that, sir.'
'Listen!'
- 'I hear the motor.'
- 'It's him!'
Light the petrol!
Light the petrol!
Off with it!
Open it!
Back from the trench!
- That's a German plane.
- Look out everybody!
Got incoming!
'He dropped something.'
Here's the package he dropped, sir.
What's that mean?
It means..
The gallant gentleman died this afternoon.
Goodbye..
...old son.
Do you mind turning that off, please.
- Righto!
- Thanks.
Quiet, lads.
Attention over there, please.
Orders for tomorrow.
Orders, fellows.
You'll be glad to know that our squadron has received special mention for his part in checking the enemy advance.
A flight ready to take off at dawn to patrol the mass sector of 3500 meters.
There'll be new men up tonight to fill in the necessary replacements.
...:::Lord Sadler:::... lordsadler2012@gmail.com
Here he comes.
I wonder who they're gonna knock off today.
Harrison, 35923.
Conklin, 52425.
It's for you, Bill.
The captain wants to see you on the porch.
Gilman, 38216.
I know what this means.
Two weeks in solitary.
And all I said was the captain of the yard had stinkweed for a family tree.
So long, boys.
What's all this stuff about the captain's porch?
Sounds like a tea party to me.
Listen, fish. You'll learn.
Stay away from that porch.
- 50878, Hastings.
- Yes, sir.
Privileges suspended till further notice.
52425, Conklin.
- Conklin!
- Yes, sir.
Ten days' solitary.
- What's that?
- Twenty days in solitary.
- I thought you said 10 days, sir.
- I said 30. Do you hear that?
Keep your mouth shut.
He's liable to keep paying you back until you're there the rest of your life.
Druggin, the warden wants to see you right away.
All right. Take charge.
- Druggin gave Bill 30 days.
- For what?
Some day I'm gonna kill that guy.
Bill didn't do anything. He's deaf.
He didn't hear him and he didn't hear him yesterday.
Stick him in solitary.
Put us all in the cooler!
Beat our brains out, Druggin!
Take a bath in our blood.
It'll make you sleep better, you...
- Shut up, you.
- I won't shut up.
I'll tell that guy what I think of him.
I'll kill that...
- Druggin will get his...
- All right!
Hang on!
- Druggin will get this.
- Stand back, there!
Line up!
Get their numbers!
You guys'll be back on the porch tomorrow.
- Wanted to see me, sir?
- Yes, Druggin.
I've just been notified that
Captain Jameson will be here Thursday.
- He'll be the new captain of the yard.
- You mean I'm out?
No. You'll return to your old post.
Operations Lieutenant.
It was understood that you were only temporary, Captain.
Yeah, but I thought if I handled the job all right I could keep it.
If you'd handled it all right,
Jameson wouldn't be coming in.
Well, that's a fine reward for 10 years' service.
You're not the man for the job, Druggin.
You've proved that.
- What do you mean I'm not...
- Now wait a minute.
You're as good as any officer I've known on handling the general routine of a prison.
But you can't handle these convicts.
You don't understand them.
You don't know men.
A while ago, it was small riots.
Now it's open rebellion one time after another.
The public's demanding that it be stopped and they're right.
They're on the prison board's neck, and the board's on mine.
That's why Jameson's coming in.
Who is this great man-handler Jameson?
He's one of the best training officers in the United States Army.
He's on special leave to work with us and I expect you to give him your fullest cooperation.
That's all.
Well, you better tell him to look to his spurs.
Some of these guys around here might steal them.
Losing out to a tin soldier. I must...
Nope. You can't rib me about this prison routine.
It's training men and I like the job.
What's the difference if it's behind stone walls or an army camp?
- What's the difference?
- Wait till you're locked behind those walls.
You'll wish you were back on an army post.
Yeah. It's too bad, Steve.
I certainly hate to think of you molding away up there for two years so far from the world.
Away from all this!
It's your last night out.
You better make the most of it.
Yeah. I've been giving that a lot of thought, too.
- Now, there's something for tired eyes.
- And ears.
Look out, Steve, training one woman is worse than a whole company of citizen recruits.
I know.
Yeah, but look at all the fun you have training them.
Hi, beautiful! Now, don't go away.
- Hello, Sergeant, where's the war?
- Haven't you read the papers?
We're fighting the Indians
'cause they won't take the country back.
- Really, Sergeant?
- And don't call me sergeant.
Well, I won't if you promise to tell me what you are.
- Don't you know what two bars mean?
- Sure. Twice as many drunks as one bar.
Waiter!
Have you got a pencil and a piece of paper, please?
It's about time for reveille, isn't it?
It's more like taps for Steve.
- What's your name, gorgeous?
- May.
Oh, no. May what?
Do you mean to tell me you missed it on the poster outside?
It's De Villiers.
De... Can you spell that?
- K-E-N-N-E-D-Y.
- Oh, I get it.
French with an Irish accent, huh?
- How long have you been here?
- I just got in today from Texas.
Where are you headed?
The Presidio or Manila or Shanghai?
Well, if it was Shanghai, would it break your heart?
No. But you could send me a postcard of the geisha girls.
- They're in Japan.
- I know.
But if they knew you were in China, they'd swim over.
Say, I think you and I are gonna get along all right.
Pardon me.
Excuse me.
We're not intruding, are we?
No. Yes. Sit down.
Joe!
Hello, Sis.
- Say, listen, Sis, have you got any money?
- Yeah, a little.
What's the matter, Joe? In trouble?
Do you only think I come to you when I'm in trouble?
No, it's good news this time.
I got a job up in Seattle
- if I can make it looking halfway decent.
- Oh, I'm so glad.
- What kind of a job, Joe?
- Well, I haven't got time to tell you now.
- Will you get me the money?
- Yeah, wait a minute.
- And, Sis, hurry up.
- Okay.
- Table, sir?
- No, never mind.
He just came in the back entrance.
This is all I can spare, darling.
I wish it were more.
Oh, thanks, Sis. You're a pal.
- So long, kid. I'll write you.
- Okay.
Look out, Sis!
- Okay, Red, we got you.
- Joe, don't!
Somebody got shot.
There is nothing to be excited about.
- Let me through here.
- Let him through.
Joe, what's this mean?
It means, girlie, that your friend here tried to stick up a restaurant.
That rap in jail last year didn't teach you anything, did it?
- What's he doing here with you?
- She's okay, Chief.
I heard the whole thing from out in the alley.
He gave her a line about a job in Seattle and then made a touch.
Tough on kids like you.
Come on, Kennedy.
I'm sorry.
- Your brother?
- Yeah.
Don't take it too tough, kid.
Maybe they'll go easy on him.
No, they won't. Not this time.
- Oh, May!
- That's my cue!
Well, Jameson, there's your new army.
Looks like a man-sized job.
Well, what they need is the self-respect of belonging to a properly disciplined group.
Now, many of those men are here just because they had bad breaks.
They're not born criminals, and we don't want to turn them into criminals.
Well, if the army'll help them any,
I'm all for it.
- When do I start?
- You started.
Come on. Now that you've seen them, we'll let them have a look at you.
Blow the whistle and fall them in.
Fall in!
Fall in.
- Pipe the new captain of the yard.
- New captain of the yard?
There goes the army.
Click your heels, boys.
There goes the tin soldier.
Oh, Druggin, I want you to meet the new captain of the yard.
Captain Jameson, this is Lieutenant Druggin.
- He's been acting captain.
- Lieutenant, I'm glad to know you.
How do you do, sir?
Come on now and meet the boys.
Hey, son, put that bench over here for me, will you, please?
All right, Captain.
Boys, this is Captain Jameson, the new captain of the yard.
Hooray!
Hello, boys.
I'm not much on making speeches.
I don't believe in them.
I don't think you want to hear them anyway.
I figure actions count a lot more than words.
Now, all I ask for is order and discipline.
If anyone feels like getting funny,
I'll guarantee I'll get the last laugh.
Hey, you. Come here.
Who? Me?
Yes, you! Number seven, row three, with the broken beak. Come on up.
- He gets solitary for that.
- He gets what I give him.
You heard me, I said come up here.
Can you tie that?
He must have eyes in the back of his head.
- So you're a crooner, huh?
- Yeah, I'm a crooner.
Well, that's fine. Let's hear you croon.
Go on. Sing nice and loud so all your pals can hear you.
Go on. Get up there and sing!
I got it up too low.
All right, Lieutenant. Start your line.
Come on.
Get back up there!
This way.
Hello, Gus. Got my room ready for me?
Well, if it isn't 'Sailor Boy' Hansen.
I'm sorry, but they put a guest in your room for the weekend.
You can have it as soon as he leaves though.
Weekend? What do you mean, weekend?
- Ten years.
- Come on.
Hoffman, you've been doing fine.
I'm gonna take you out of the machine shop.
What do you want, the road gang or the laundry?
The road gang, sir.
All right. Report for duty at the office in the morning.
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
- That's all.
- Let's go.
Outside.
Boy, what wouldn't I give for a good dose of hay fever or even to get a sniff at the backfire of an old flivver.
- How are you, Sailor Boy?
- How do I look?
Well, Hansen, you kind of like it up here, don't you?
It's the State's idea, Captain. Not mine.
Yeah. Well, looks like you'll be here for quite a while.
Get your receipt at the office.
Well, now that you've had a good look at my face, how do you like it?
I don't like it. I've seen it before.
- Oh, yeah? Where?
- Forget it. Maybe I will, too.
Well, Kennedy, you've been pretty busy for a fellow your age, haven't you?
Well, I been around.
Yeah, well, you won't be getting around so much now.
You know, if you're smart, you'll turn your sentence to advantage.
Maybe you'll learn a trade.
Supposing I don't wanna?
You'll learn one anyway and like it.
Come on.
- Got any folks on the outside, Kennedy?
- Yeah, a sister.
- She got any dough?
- Nope.
That's too bad.
You need it to buy the luxuries you can have around here.
- Yeah? What luxuries?
- Oh, tobacco and chocolate.
And believe me, you get to wanting them around this college.
- Pretty nice campus, ain't it?
- Yeah, it's big.
Well, it may look big to you now.
Wait till you been here for a stretch.
You feel like you're in a telephone booth with four other guys and no telephone.
- Hiya, Sailor Boy.
- Hello, kid.
I just heard you got back.
I been looking for you.
- How's all that Spring Street gang?
- Oh, they're swell.
Pete's doing a six month stretch for the county and Duffy,
Duffy's running book at a new joint.
It's great. And Louis, you remember Louis?
- The guy with the gunboats for the feet?
- Sure.
Well, he got himself a job on the dock, tripped over a hawser and fell into the drink.
He's still standing on the bottom waiting for someone to tell him to come up.
- Did you see Casey?
- Forget them slobs!
What about the dames?
Say, did you see Gladys?
- Did she get my letter?
- No, I didn't see her.
You're a fine pal, not to look her up.
I heard she had moved.
That's the trouble with you, Mickey.
You're driving yourself stir crazy thinking about that dame.
Forget her.
She'll be so old when you got out of here, you won't even know her from your own grandmother.
- It's kind of tough on you guys.
- Yeah.
- You'll soon learn, fish.
- Oh, not me. I'll be out of here like a shot.
I got pals on the outside that can pull wires.
Honest, kid?
- Think you can do something for me?
- I'll see what I can do when I get out.
Gee, thanks.
You know, I really got here on a bum rap.
- Say...
We got a fresh fish over there, number 53834.
- You wanna do your stuff?
- Sure.
- Okay. Wait till I get back there, will you?
- All right.
I'll never sit in a cell and go stir crazy.
Too many people want me in circulation.
- That's you, Red.
Hey, that's me. What's up?
Get your stuff from your cell.
You're going back to San Francisco.
- Gee, they sprung you.
- A pardon!
- Can you beat that? He wasn't kidding.
- I'll say I wasn't!
- Well, so long. It's nice to have known you.
- So long.
Hey, turkey, open up.
Where do you think you're going?
I gotta get my stuff out of my cell.
I've been pardoned. Open it up, will you?
Go on, you fat head. Get back in the yard.
They've been ribbing you.
If you got a pardon, I got $1 million.
Let him have his stuff!
Let him have his clothes!
He's got a pardon!
What's the matter, Red?
Forget something?
You said it.
Here, come on. What's the idea?
Break this. Come on.
Why, you crazy fish, you can't do that to me.
Come on, here, straighten up.
You know it's against the rules to fight.
- What've you got to say for yourself?
- Nothing.
You must like solitary confinement
'cause that's where you're gonna begin this stretch.
- Take him away.
- Come on.
You only came in yesterday.
You're trying to show us how tough you are already, eh?
- Shut up and give me the works.
- All right. You asked for it.
We'll let the captain of the yard give you the answer.
Come on with me.
Now take it easy, I can walk.
- What is it, Lieutenant?
- Kennedy, he came in yesterday, he started a fight with his cellmate.
How do you know he started it?
I know everything that goes on in this prison, Captain.
Kennedy started blowing off about the big shots he knew and how they're gonna have him out of here in no time.
All right. So what?
So the boys pulled a gag on him and he couldn't take it.
He got sore and he started a fight.
I know the type.
The way to handle them is to break them right in the beginning.
Show them where to head in before they got started.
My advice to you is to give this guy solitary for a month.
When I want your advice, I'll ask for it.
That's all, Druggin.
Stand up straight.
One of those tough guys that can hand it out, but can't take it, huh?
I can do both, but I won't take anything from them lugs.
You're getting off to a bad start, Kennedy.
Five years in the reform school, a year in the county jail, you come in here for assault with a deadly weapon.
You're asking for solitary right off the bat.
You left out one thing.
I kicked a guy in the face once because he was a cop.
Oh, yeah? A tinhorn hoodlum, huh?
Let me tell you something, Kennedy.
You got a lot to learn.
Too bad you weren't in the army.
It might've done you a lot of good.
Learn how to got along with the crowd, have some respect for others, it might've made you a lot happier.
All right, guard.
Well, it's your first offense.
Privileges suspended for a month.
Solitary, four days.
That's it, Siberia.
Oh, and, Kennedy, you might give that army idea a lot of thought.
Do you a lot of good.
- One?
- Please.
This way.
Thank you.
What you got on here that's good?
Everything. May I recommend the lobster?
- Or the sweetbreads a la...
- Never mind.
Hello. I was just going in to see you.
Hello, yourself.
Too bad you missed the floor show.
- We had some new routines.
- That's all right.
You're the important one.
You're the one I want to see.
Well, why the store clothes?
Have you left the service?
No, not exactly, but I've got sort of an outside assignment.
Oh, can't talk about it, huh?
Yeah, something like that.
Well, that's the way it's worked out.
- Say, can I make a suggestion?
- Sure. Go ahead.
Let's drop by and get something to eat before you go home.
Well, I wouldn't mind going home and shaking up a pan of ham and eggs myself, that is, if you like home cooking.
I don't wanna hear anybody knock it.
Say, I got a nice yellow job outside. Taxi!
It doesn't look as if you get much home cooking.
Well, they don't let you carry your own cook in the army.
- Want some more coffee?
- All right. Thanks.
I don't mind staying awake all night.
- You worry about him a lot, don't you?
- Yeah.
You saw him arrested.
They sent him to prison.
Well, I'll tell you, May, it's not gonna do any good worrying about it.
Yeah, I know, but I can't help it.
He's in for 10 years, and I know what it'll do to him.
It'll break him. His spirit, everything.
I saw what the reform school did for him.
He was just a roughneck kid before that, like any of the rest.
Prison will finish the job of making him a criminal.
On the other hand, it might do him a lot of good.
Oh, no, it won't.
Not what they're doing to him.
He's been up there a month, and they've thrown him into solitary cells on bread and water, and taken his privileges away from him.
I can't even see him. I've tried to.
I've been up there.
Guards and officers, they should be called animal trainers.
You haven't got much use for those guards, have you?
I hate the very thought of them.
Yeah.
Sit right over there.
Kennedy!
Hello, Sis.
I've been here every Sunday for the past month, but they wouldn't let me see you.
Joe, what did they put you in the dungeon for?
- What did you do?
- Nothing. The guy that's running the joint.
It's his big idea to show you how tough he is, before you've even had a chance to turn around.
But you must have done something.
You must have broken some rule.
Well, I had a fight, but nobody told me it was against the rules.
But you don't have to worry about that.
- Did you bring the dough?
- Yeah.
- Are you sure it's all right, Joe?
- Sure, it's all right.
Give me that money.
I'll have to report this to the office, lady.
It's against the rules to give prisoners money.
I thought you said it was all right.
Well, if a guy wants some good food and a smoke once in a while.
These turkeys think you can live on memories.
There's a Miss Kennedy in there.
Tried to sneak this cash to her brother.
You want his number?
Yeah. And tell the dame
I want to see her on her way out.
Kennedy.
So long, kid.
The lieutenant wants to speak to you, miss.
All right.
This is Miss Kennedy, Lieutenant.
What's the idea of passing money to a prisoner?
I didn't know it was against the rules.
Come on, sister,
I'm reporting you to the captain.
Your sightseeing days in this pen are over.
Sit down.
The captain will be right over from the yard.
- May.
- I don't understand.
Well, I guess you two don't need an introduction.
What's this all about, Lieutenant?
She was caught passing money to Red Kennedy, her brother.
According to the book of rules, that's a serious offense.
Okay. I'll handle this myself.
And I'll handle Kennedy.
Why didn't you tell me?
Well, I was going to until you told me what you thought about prison guards.
Well, you didn't need to lie to me.
Don't get me wrong, May,
I didn't lie to you.
I wanted to wait until
I had some good news about your brother before I told you anything else.
Good news, you've got a beautiful sense of humor.
Privileges suspended, thrown into a dungeon, for what?
Because it might make a man out of him.
Make him tough and bitter and hopeless and ashamed.
Now you wait a minute. You listen to me.
I've handled men all my life.
I ought to know something about them.
I think Red's got a lot of stuff in him.
But I wanna bring it out in my way.
That's why I'm here.
It's my job.
Suspend Kennedy's privileges for a month.
- Is that all?
- No. Change his cell.
He shouldn't have been with those second-timers
- in the first place.
- Where will I put him, in the cooler?
Put him where he belongs, with the first offenders.
That's all.
Captain of the yard! Inspection!
- Whose is that lower bunk?
- Mine, sir.
What's the matter? Don't you know how to fold your blankets properly?
No, sir, I just got here yesterday.
You been here long enough.
Why don't you show him?
Yes, sir.
- Oh, Captain.
- Yes, Rogers?
Your soul, Captain.
- Has it been saved?
- Yes.
I understand, fella. Take it easy.
Dopey shouldn't be in prison, Captain.
When the board meets,
I'm gonna have him transferred.
Well, Simpson. Writing again, huh?
- How's the story coming?
- Fine, Captain. I'm almost finished.
Here, read this.
Well, I'll wait till after it's published.
You know, I never could understand how a man with your brains ever got into a place like this.
Well, I couldn't live on rejection slips.
I didn't start getting checks till I got in here.
- Maybe the address impressed them.
- Yes, sir.
- Who are you?
- Dorgan, Captain.
Oh, yes, Dorgan.
I'm a writer, too.
Oh, I think I remember now.
It was writing other people's names on checks, wasn't it?
Correct, Captain.
Trouble was I retired so long,
I got out of practice.
Well, how do you like your new cell, Kennedy?
It's all right.
I'd like it better if I could take a walk or go to a ball game or even do some work.
Well, your privileges will be restored tomorrow.
There'll be a machine waiting for you in one of the shops.
It's the first time
I ever heard work called a privilege.
Well, maybe you'll think differently after tomorrow.
There are other jobs in here, a lot easier to take.
You just toe the line, stick to the rules and, before you know it, they'll be knocking time off your sentence.
Jameson's a swell guy.
Simpson ought to put him in his story.
Yeah, he's just another copper to me.
- You know how to run this machine?
- Sure.
- We're old friends.
- All right. Go to it.
Not sore, are you?
No, I just lost my temper at that punk joke.
You can fight. I like a guy that fights hard.
Yeah, I can fight.
Takes nerve to fight your way out of a tough spot.
- What do you mean, tough spot?
- This one.
Not me.
I'm gonna work my way out of this shop.
Yeah? Then what?
- I don't know. Do you?
- Sure I know. I'll tell you.
They tell me you tried to go over the wall the last time you were in here, but you couldn't make it.
They were waiting for you at the top, weren't they?
Yeah.
But I've been thinking.
A wall is bad business.
Here they are.
All four of them and we're on the inside.
- There's no way to go around them.
- Or over them or under them.
- Give me the lowdown.
- The road gang, Red.
When you're on the road gang, you're on the outside of those walls.
All you got to do is to thumb a passing car and ride away.
How do you make the road gang?
I thought it was a privilege.
By keeping the nose clean.
Boys, have your souls been saved?
Brothers, I bring you a message of eternal salvation.
If you will...
There you are.
You godless men!
Hellfire shall be your lot.
Your souls shall burn till Judgment Day!
Break it up! Break it up! Sit down there!
Now, let this man alone.
Come on, Red.
Are you gonna finish this game or not?
- Hiya, Sailor.
- Hi, kid.
Well, if it ain't Red.
How's all your influential friends?
Still pulling wires for you?
Nix on that stuff, Red, you know where a fight lands you.
- What's going on here?
- Oh, nothing.
Come on, Red. Let's finish the game.
What do you say?
Hey, Hank. Hank!
Get back. Get back there!
- Look out!
- Look out!
Stop!
Stop! Don't trifle with me.
You see what the guard got?
Stand back, all of you, and listen!
You scoffed when I wanted to bring you salvation.
Don't shoot.
You laughed when I told you to repent.
- Choose now, ye blasphemers.
- Come on, break it up.
...whether ye shall repent and be saved, for I am the instrument of Providence.
Woe be unto you if you do not see the light, for I'll wipe you from the face of the earth.
- Put down that gun, Rogers.
- Stay where you are!
Stand back. Stand back.
Stand back or I'll...
Come on, Rogers, put down that gun.
How are the boys gonna repent if you don't give them a chance?
Pull yourself together, fella.
You haven't got anything to fear from me.
You know that, don't you?
Sure, Captain.
You're the only one that's never laughed at my message.
But you let these men scoff at me when I would show them the way of truth.
They beat me and spat upon me and you did nothing to stop them.
You, too, are one with them, Captain!
Stand back!
Take it easy, Rogers.
The boys'll all listen to you if you only give them a chance.
But you've gotta take it easy.
Lay off!
Lay off! Take him away!
Where to, the dungeon, Captain?
No, to the hospital.
That man is mentally sick.
Recall me. I'll bring them salvation!
Boy, that was a close one.
- That took plenty of nerve.
- It sure did.
I don't know.
Anybody could have done what he did.
Yeah, but nobody did.
Burnett, 49863.
- Kennedy, 53834.
- Yeah?
Report to the porch.
Richardson, 52...
53834, Kennedy.
The names and numbers I called, get up on the porch to report for road gang duty in the morning.
- Why didn't I get it?
- What's the idea?
All right! Shut up! Get back in line!
Captain of the yard's orders.
- How do you rate it?
- Maybe they changed the rules.
What kind of a raw deal is this?
I've been rating that road gang for six weeks and I'm still cleaning out.
That guy, Jameson, pulling some of that military stuff.
- He can't get away with it.
- Oh, no?
"Oh, no," is right. Not if you guys got the nerve to brace him. I'm gonna.
- Lieutenant.
- Get back there.
Ain't you forgot a few numbers?
I've been rating the road gang since way back.
- Check!
- Me, too.
What's the idea?
Captain's orders.
I got nothing to do with it.
What's he doing, boys?
Trying to gyp us out of our rights?
- Captain's orders. Break it up.
- Oh, come on...
Break it up!
All right, go on.
How do you like that for a raw deal?
So it's come to you gotta be a fink to make the fresh air squad.
Only the fresh fish get the good jobs in this pen.
We earn them and they get them.
That captain's so crooked, he ought to be wearing a number.
If you play straight, you can suck jute dust in your lungs for life.
I'll show him.
If I don't go to work on that road gang,
I don't go to work anywhere else.
Well, I'm staying right here in this yard until that tinhorn captain gets wise to himself.
- Me, too.
- I'm with you, Muggsy.
- Same here.
- Let's strike.
- Sure.
- Yeah.
The captain's cheating us out of our privileges.
Let's show him, no work.
Now, remember, we strike.
We don't go to work when that whistle blows.
Nix, dummy up.
- Why don't you play the deuce?
- Gangway.
Break it up.
Remember, no work!
Come on, break up.
Come on, break it up. Come on.
Break it up. Come on.
What's the matter? Can't you hear that whistle? Go back to work.
- There ain't gonna be no work.
- Oh, no?
No, none of us goes to work.
We'll see about that.
You yellow monkey.
The men won't go back to work, sir.
- Why not?
- I don't know.
It's the answer to your new road gang orders, Captain.
- The men won't clear the yard, Captain.
- They'll clear...
- You're not going in the yard?
- Yes, I'm going in the yard.
That's a swell bid for your own finish.
They'll kill you.
No, I don't think so.
Quiet, all of you!
All right. What's this all about?
You know what it's about, Captain.
You're trying to double-cross us on the good jobs.
Quiet!
Quiet!
You heard that whistle.
Back to your jobs, all of you.
Nothing doing. We won't go back to work!
All right, then don't. Back to your cells.
Till you decide to obey orders, no chow.
Quiet!
I want this yard cleared in two minutes.
That's it. Lock up.
Come on.
Better turn out the lights.
Hello, Bay City Press.
Let me talk to Slim Mackey.
Hello, Slim. Sharpen up your pencil.
I got a story for you.
Regardless of your plans, we can't tolerate conditions that get this kind of headlines in the papers.
So that's the reason you countermanded my road gang assignments.
Afraid of the headlines, huh?
No. We did it because it's obvious this plan won't work.
How do you know it won't work?
You checked my first order before it goes into effect.
But this riot.
That riot was over at 7:00 the following morning.
The men had breakfast and went back to work.
Now, you brought me here to get results.
I came out of the army where we do get results.
However, if they prove unsatisfactory,
I'll admit that I've failed.
It's not that, Captain.
We know your ability and your record.
But this extreme measure of taking earned privileges from the men is hard even for us to accept.
Mr. Barrett, there are two types of men in this prison.
Now, the first group, no matter what you do for them, they'll never reform.
They're habitual criminals.
They've spent most of their lives in prison.
They're very clever at earning credits to get themselves the softest jobs.
They ask to go on the road gangs primarily with the hope of escape.
Now the second group are definitely trying to reform. They're sincere.
And they deserve rewards.
And if I stay on here,
I'm gonna see to it that they get them.
Gentlemen, I'm convinced that Jameson is right.
And, if you'll allow me to give him a free hand,
I'm sure that he'll give you the results you want.
All right, Jameson. Go ahead.
But we must have order and discipline.
All right, you'll get it.
I'd like to speak to Captain Jameson, please.
We don't allow ladies in the yard.
I'll have to call his office.
- What's the name?
- Just tell him a lady wants to see him.
Tell Captain Jameson a lady would like to see him.
Eyes front, there.
- A lady here to see me?
- Yes, sir. She's right over there.
- You wanted to see me?
- Why, yes, Steve, I...
Now, wait a minute.
Before you start taking any swings at me, you go and talk to that brother of yours.
He's been behaving himself, May.
He's getting along fine.
I did talk to him, Steve. Just now.
That's why I'm here.
Ho told me how you saved his life and the others' by taking that gun away from a madman.
I wanted to thank you.
Well, I'm afraid I wasn't thinking of anybody but myself just then.
No, it was swell.
I want to apologize for everything
I said to you.
Oh, I was afraid for Joe, but he says you've been grand to him.
Well, he's earned it lately.
He's been taking a different attitude on things.
I know it. He never wanted to be square with people before.
He's got a lot of stuff in him, May.
Don't you worry about him.
Well, I won't from now on.
Well, now that the war's over, do you think it's safe to go to San Francisco?
Oh, I think it might be safe to come over tonight and try some more home cooking.
- I'm practically there.
- Okay, I'll see you.
Don't be surprised if that con Red Kennedy ends up with my job tomorrow.
What are you looking so gloomy about?
Gee, Sailor. It ain't doing me any good having you here in stir.
I'll believe you, but only because I ain't got time to argue.
Now get a load of this and get it straight.
I got a chance of getting on the road gang.
That's tough, dearie.
What was you doing, fighting again?
No. What do you mean, tough?
I've been working for it ever since I got in here.
Hey, have you still got that old bus of yours?
Sure, but it'll be just a bunch of spare parts by the time you get out.
Yeah? That's where you're wrong. Listen.
The road gang is working on the inland highway about two miles west of where Route 28 crosses it.
If I make it, I'll let you know.
Now all you gotta do is to drive by there every morning like you was going to work.
You know, so the guards will get to know you. And then...
I'm sure it'll be good news for you this time.
- I'll let you know.
- Thanks.
And then keep your eye peeled for a signal from me. That's all.
There's the complete road gang list.
Start tomorrow morning.
- Parole board okayed your plans, eh?
- Yeah, they okayed them.
Long chance to take after those fireworks, Captain.
What if it don't work? They'll stop the rest of your plans, won't they?
They'll probably fire me.
Aren't you a little concerned about what's going to happen to me?
And about what's going to happen to me, too.
If a real riot breaks out in this place,
I got as good a chance as you of getting a knife in the ribs.
Yeah. Well, we'll have to see that doesn't happen.
Change that list of cards over from the machine shop to the road assignment file. That's all.
Yes, sir.
Hey, you drop that?
Well, pick it up.
You know better than to dirty up the yard.
- What do you got?
- Sailor Boy's planning a road gang break.
- He isn't even on a road gang.
- Well, I don't know. I heard him talking.
Wait a minute. I didn't dismiss you yet.
You've been a pretty good con.
How'd you like to go on a road gang?
- Might be able to do yourself a lot of good.
- Yes, sir.
Well, get up on the porch.
- Keep moving, boys.
- Okay. Take it away.
Hey, pop!
- Give us a drink of water, will you?
- Tired, son?
This road work is tough on a beginner.
Well, anything's better than that big house.
You're right, kid. Take it from an old man that's put 24 years of his life in stir.
If you've got time to do, do it the easy way.
Do it the hard way and they'll break you.
Do your time and make a fresh start.
You know, anybody'd ever told me a year ago that I'd enjoy digging out the side of a mountain,
I'd have said they was crazy.
That's the trouble with you, Red.
You're fresh air daffy.
I don't suppose you'd like to make a break and be on the outside away from them.
And spend the rest of my life hiding out?
What good would it do you?
You'd find out what good it'd do you if we could kiss this outfit goodbye.
- Oh, like that, eh?
- Sure.
Look.
When I give her the high sign, she'll be all set on the next time through.
I need a guy like you, Red, a guy that knows how to handle himself in a tight spot.
And believe me, the going's liable to get tough.
- You want to break with me, kid?
- Not me, Sailor.
- Yellow?
- Yeah.
Just as yellow as I was when I took a sock at you.
All right, all right.
I thought I'd do you a favor.
I thought maybe you'd like to be out with a dame one of these nights instead of listening to 60 cons snoring in the bunkhouse.
My term isn't as long as yours, Sailor.
I'm working it out.
A couple of years of behaving myself and I'll be out on the right side.
All right, boys.
How do you like the road gang, Red?
That pick and shovel business will put you in shape.
It's all right when you get used to it, only I ain't used to it.
Well, if it ain't my old pal, Red!
How did you make the road gang, fella?
You had plenty of trouble when you first come in.
Why, Red's a friend of the governor's.
Ain't you, pal?
You remember, fellas,
Red's got all them big-shot friends on the outside.
Button it up, you guys, I'm tired.
Red's got a better in than the governor.
He's got a good-looking sister.
Hey, listen.
You can crack all you want to about me,
- but lay off my sister, you hear?
- Take your mitts off of me.
I didn't mean anything.
That is, no more than the whole prison knows.
Yeah? What does the whole prison know?
You think Captain Jameson's swell to you because he thinks you're a great guy?
How do I know what he thinks?
He's treating you pretty swell just the same!
- And he's calling on your sister!
- Why, you...
All right, Red. Let's cut it out.
What's going on here?
Why... Why nothing, mister.
We was just clowning.
Well, cut out the clowning.
You crazy fool.
That won't get you any place but back in the icebox.
I'll make that guy eat those words if I have to spend a year in solitary.
- Hey, Sailor.
- Yeah?
That guy on the level with that crack about my sister?
He's right.
It's been all over the prison for weeks.
It's a wonder you didn't get wise sooner.
It was all too phony, you being treated with kid gloves.
- Jameson, huh?
- Yeah.
He's been seeing her in the prison, too, every time she comes to visit you.
Yeah?
I'll have to give these guys something else to talk about.
Some day Jameson will go across the bay and he won't come back.
- When do we break, Sailor?
- Now you're talking, Red.
- Hello. How are things going?
- Okay. We're up to schedule.
The Highway Commission's gonna look you over in about an hour or so.
Keep this gang hopping.
Come on! Get going.
What're you doing here, Sailor?
Somebody paying off for you, too?
Easy, Red.
I don't get you, Lieutenant.
You will.
It won't be long now, kid.
She's due any minute.
Here she comes now.
- What do we do, make a run for it?
- No.
Move on, lady.
- You can't stop here.
- I can't help it. I got a flat.
- Give me a hand with it, will you?
- Sure, lady. Sure.
And which one of these cons will I give my gun to hold for me?
Ain't I dumb?
Well, I tell you what.
Let a couple of your boys do it.
I'll take the wheel barrow. Follow me.
- It's not according to regulations, lady.
- Neither is a flat tire.
Come on. You wouldn't have a girl spend the night out here alone, would you?
All right. I guess we can fix you up.
Hey! You two. Over here and change tires.
- Sure, we'll do it.
- Make it snappy.
Thanks, Captain. This is swell of you.
If I was late again tonight, it would have cost me my job.
That's all right.
Just switch off your motor.
I'll take the key, lady.
- Where are the tools?
- Over there.
Unlock the tire and the tools, will you, Captain?
- Thanks. This is swell of you.
- That's all right, lady.
- How long will this camp be here?
- Till this road's finished.
- Well, do they get paid for this?
- Sure they get paid for it.
They pay for their own food, clothing and tobacco.
The rest is credited to their account at the prison.
They get it when they go free.
Do all the prisoners get a chance to make this road gang?
No. Only the short-termers and those that rate it with good behavior.
- Now can I give the boys anything?
- No charge, lady. This one's on the State.
- What's going on here?
- Please, don't bawl him out, mister.
He let these two boys change a flat tire for me.
It was swell of him. I couldn't have...
Stick 'em up, Druggin!
Get behind the wheel, Red.
- Turn around!
- Help!
Come on, Red!
Get in the track and move it, will you?
Stop shooting.
They've got Druggin in that car.
Okay. Get back there. Get back there.
Come on, get back there!
Stay back.
Ain't this swell?
- Now, listen, Sailor.
- Yeah, keep him covered.
I've been waiting for years to get my hands on you, you mug.
Don't do that, Sailor. Listen.
I'm the one that got you the chance!
- I got you on the road gang.
- Well, ain't that swell?
- Now, ain't you glad you did it?
- Listen, I'm your friend!
- Yeah, a pal.
- No, don't! Don't, Sailor!
Don't do that, Sailor! Sailor! No!
- Where are the clothes?
- Right at your feet.
Oh, yeah. Here you are, Red.
A break in the road gang.
- Who were they?
- We don't know yet.
We haven't got the count.
They're headed east.
A heavy touring car.
License number 2X8193.
Call the Sheriff's office.
Two men escaped from the road gang!
Notify all departments.
Big touring car, 2X8193.
And I'll be in the warden's office.
Sheriff's office.
Come on, Red! Step on it.
They're picking up on us.
Try to get their gas tank or a tire.
- How much gas did you put in?
- It was a full tank.
The gauge shows empty.
Calling all cars.
Two men escaped from State Penitentiary road gang.
Headed east in touring car.
- Here comes a car. Let's grab it.
- Okay. Hang on.
Leave your motor running.
Come on, get outside.
You, too, sister. Hurry it up!
Ditch the car up the road.
We'll see you later.
Come on, Red. Knock on it, will you?
Beat this train, Red, and we're all set.
Sailor? Sailor?
This one's dead, Sheriff.
But how did Hansen get on the road gang?
I don't know and there's not much chance of finding out now with Druggin dead.
Yes?
- It's for you, Jameson.
- Oh, thanks.
Hello?
Thank you.
Well, they found the car wrecked and Hansen's dead.
- What about Kennedy?
- He got away.
And you asked the parole board to judge your plans by results.
You haven't got much chance now, Steve.
It'll be proof your judgment's wrong.
Yeah, but Hansen's break proves something else.
It proved I was right about keeping that other crowd off the list.
Maybe, but they'll still hold Kennedy against you.
And he was gonna be your shining example.
You know, it's a funny thing.
I can't figure that out.
Now, if this happened yesterday, he wouldn't have made that break even if somebody left the gates open for him.
I don't know, Steve.
When a man's on the level, he doesn't repay kindness by sticking a knife in your back.
I'm afraid, for once you guessed wrong.
Well, I can settle that question.
- How?
- I'm going out and find him.
What's the idea waking me up...
Red?
- What are you doing here?
- Give me some.38s.
You crazy? Coming to town!
Cops will be looking all over for you.
- You better get out of here.
- I will.
But I gotta plug a guy first.
Will you get me a box of slugs?
Sure.
Further bulletins
from the Press Radio Association
concerning the escaped convict
will be announced as received.
I will repeat the description
of Red Kennedy, who is still at large.
Twenty-five years old, 5'10"...
- That's him?
- No. Too stocky. Kennedy's thin.
Steve, have you found out anything about him?
- You haven't seen him, have you?
- No.
I don't know where he is. I'm nearly crazy.
- What happened? What made him do it?
- I don't know.
- You're sure he hasn't been here?
- No, Steve.
Oh, I'd do anything to straighten this out.
If I could only find him and talk to him.
He must be mad.
When I talked to him he was happy.
He was going straight and he meant it.
They'll get him now and he won't have another chance.
- What reason did he have?
- I don't know. I can't figure it out.
- I'll tell you, copper.
- Joe!
Shut up! You been giving me favors so you could kick her around in the gutter.
Thought you had her in a swell spot with me locked up.
Thought it was safe for you to come here.
Well, here's your second payoff.
- Joe, don't!
- You keep out of it.
That's a lie, Red.
You're talking out of your head.
Give me that gun!
Yeah, and all the slugs with it.
Joe! Don't! You can't! Please, listen to me.
We're in love!
We've been in love ever since we met.
You've got to believe me.
- Steve, you're hurt!
- No, I'm all right.
Can't you understand?
He tried to help you.
He did everything he could.
He even risked his job trying to make a man out of you and you pay him back by trying to kill him.
Sailor told you all these lies, huh?
- Or Druggin?
- Yeah.
Well, Red, I gave you credit for having more sense than that.
Taking the word of a lot of rats against your sister.
Did it ever occur to you that Druggin framed this break to ruin my chances of doing anything at the prison?
- Coppers?
- Wait a minute. Let us handle this.
Come on, Joe. Quick, in here.
- Steve, you are hurt.
- No, I'm all right.
- What is it, boys?
- We heard some shots.
We're on special patrol to look for Kennedy, a con that broke...
That's what I'm here for, too.
But there weren't any shots.
It must've been a backfire in the alley or something.
Kennedy's not here.
I'll be responsible for this end of it.
And I want him a lot more than you.
I'm Jameson, captain of the yards,
San Quentin.
All right, Captain.
- What'll we do?
- I want to talk to Red.
Well, May, he's on his own.
Halt!
- Hey, give me a lift, will you?
- Sure. Bet you your life.
- Jump in.
- Thanks.
- It's pretty lonesome walking at night, eh?
- Yeah, pretty lonesome.
My car broke down.
Where you go?
Drop me at San Quentin crossroads.
Sure. That's a long walk.
Yeah.
- You look pretty tired, huh?
- Yeah.
Why don't you stay in your car till morning?
Got to get where I'm going.
Oh.
Halt! Who's there?
- Who is it?
- Kennedy!
Get the doctor.
It's no use. I don't need him.
Tell...
Tell Jameson I come back.
Tell...
Tell the cons to play ball with him.
He's...
He's a swell...
English
-Happy birthday, Mrs. Hawkins.
-Yes, Mrs. Hawkins.
Younger every year.
None of your frippery, John Harrow.
But music and friends do make you feeI--
-Where's Jim?
-He's in the kitchen, I think.
Just put a head on that one, John.
It's going to thunder and Iightning.
Then you best go
Iock yourseIf up in a cIoset.
You made that cake?
No, I didn't.
And I'II thank you not to say I did.
Jim Hawkins made a cake!
Jim Hawkins made a cake!
No, I didn't.
OnIy girIs make cakes.
My mother made this cake herseIf.
SureIy she had to have a cake for her birthday.
Jim Hawkins dropped a cake!
Jim Hawkins dropped a cake!
Jim Hawkins dropped a cake!
Stop foIIowing me around.
Upon my souI!
Why, Jim, you didn't go and bake a--?
Here's the cake you made, Mother.
I trust it's good.
It's the best cake ever.
I raise a mug to Jim Hawkins, proprietor of the AdmiraI Benbow.
-Jim.
-Speech!
-Come on, get up.
-Speech, speech.
WeII, I don't know what to say, but ever since Father died. . .
. . .and with Mother having to do the work, I'm gIad each time she gets oIder.
I mean, then I get oIder too.
And soon I'II be abIe to do aII the work and won't have to make speeches.
Here she comes.
Everybody to the taproom.
We'II cut the cake in there.
Everybody take a seat.
Oh, Jim, there go the shutters.
-Go up and cIose them, wiII you?
-At your service, ma'am.
-Now what?
-I'm scared. Aren't you scared?
No, I'm not.
It's girIs that make me nervous.
Why don't you go downstairs, where there's more room to be scared in.
-I want a bunk with a sea view.
-This way, sir.
Have you seen this man around here before?
He Iooks Iike a seafaring man.
He certainIy doesn't beIong to these parts.
Hey!
I want a noggin of rum.
Yes, sir.
Mind, you cIod.
Have an eye to that chest.
Here. Now, you never made this voyage, you understand?
You never seen me and you don't know nothing.
Get out.
What are you Iooking for?
Strangers, sonny, strangers.
I don't Iike strangers coming aboard me sudden-Iike.
Makes my spine jump
Iike a porpoise, it does.
-What might your name be?
-Jim Hawkins.
Now, Iook here, Jim, you and me's going to be mates.
You'II get a siIver four-penny bit every month. . .
. . .if you watches out for strangers and comes and Iets the oId captain know. . .
. . .when they tops the horizon.
-WeII, what manner of strangers?
-Seafaring men.
WeII, aII seafaring men?
No, no, no, son.
There's a speciaI cut of the jib to these seafaring men.
But most especiaIIy, I want you to keep your eye open. . .
. . .for a seafaring man with one Ieg.
-A seafaring man with one Ieg?
-Aye.
Upon my word, sir, what shaII I teII them? What do they want?
Never you mind what they want.
You go on down beIow and get me a noggin of rum.
A doubIe noggin, Jim, because I'm becaImed.
BecaImed on a sea of troubIes, and I've got to fiII my saiIs again.
Yes, sir.
Who is he, Jim? What did he say?
I don't know. Something about seafaring men with no ears and no Iegs and no--
Hey, drop anchor, matey.
We'II fiII the cask where you Iie.
Rum for aII hands, say I.
Here's a new port aII fuII of pretty wenches. . .
. . .and strong young buckoes.
CIear the decks for pIeasant action.
FiII a pretty beIIy with grog and that's what makes the worId. . .
. . .spin on its poIes, say I.
Hey, beIay there.
-The rum.
-I'm not much on strong Iiquor, sir.
Besides, we have to go now.
It's getting--
''Go,'' say ye?
You'II stay.
You'II aII stay.
Sit yourseIves down on your binnacIes.
Jim, matey, the rum.
I ain't Iike aII seafaring men.
GenteeI, I am, and a dove at heart, mates.
Why, I know some seafaring men, them as boarded a Spanish brig. . .
. . .aII Ioaded down with
CastiIian dons and their beauteous Iadies.
And what did they do?
GenteeI Iike me, ye thinks?
No. They sIices them dons
Iike bread Ioaves. . .
. . .and feeds them to the sharks.
And what did they do to the beauteous Iadies?
Why, after courting their favor, as it were. . .
. . .saving your presence, matey. . .
. . .they sIits the veins of their pearIy white arms. . .
. . .and uses their bIue bIood to warm their rum.
And then what did they do, matey?
BIess my souI, sir, what eIse was Ieft?
There was the song, Jim.
Singing by aII hands.
Now, come on. We'II aII tip the stave.
Come on!
Come on, sing!
BottIe of rum, you oId hag!
-BottIe of rum!
-''BottIe of rum! ''
We'II tip it again now. Come on!
-Dr. Livesey.
-Mrs. Hawkins.
It was Mother's birthday. We were just having a IittIe entertainment, doctor.
WeII, my compIiments, Mrs. Hawkins.
-A IittIe brandy, Jim.
-My pIeasure, sir.
Come on, mates.
Now we'II tip it again.
-Thought sure we were in for a storm--
-Hey! SiIence there between decks.
You addressing me, sir?
Is it bIowing a gaIe of wind you can't hear me? What did I say?
I have onIy this to say:
I don't know you. But by your Iook, if you continue drinking rum. . .
. . .the worId wiII soon be rid of a very dirty scoundreI.
I'II spIit you doubIe, you--
If you do not Iower that cutIass. . .
. . .I promise on my honor that you shaII hang at the next assizes.
And furthermore, sir. . .
. . .I'm not onIy a doctor,
I'm magistrate here.
And if I catch another breath of compIaint against you. . .
. . .if onIy for a piece of inciviIity Iike this,
I'II have you routed out of here.
Let that suffice?
I ask your patience, sir.
Just a squaII from a poor oId saiIor man. . .
. . .who took too much rum over his bowsprit.
I ask your pardon.
It was a nice party.
Don't worry, Mrs. Hawkins.
Don't worry.
-Goodbye.
-Thank you.
Praise be, Jim, the man was onIy fuII of taIk.
But bIess my souI, sir.
He certainIy can sing.
WeII, sonny.
Come here.
Come here, sonny. A IittIe cIoser.
Here.
-Now, is this here tabIe for my mate BiII?
-I don't know your mate BiII.
-But don't BiII Iive here?
-No. Nobody but the captain.
Oh, captain, it is?
TruIy, sir. I can--
Here comes my oId mate BiII now.
BIess his heart, to be sure.
Jim, Iad! The rum.
I'm becaImed again.
Come, BiII. You know me.
You know an oId shipmate, sureIy.
-BIack Dog.
-BIack Dog as ever was.
Come for to see his oId shipmate BiIIy.
-WeII, speak up.
-The porter, sonny. Porter.
WeII?
Now, BiII, I've been after you, now.
No, by the powers, and there's an end to it!
If it comes to swinging, swing one, swing aII.
I'II part your dirty wig!
Out, you bIubberous barnacIe.
Next time I'II sever your guIIet.
-Humor him, Jim. I'II be back.
-Where you going?
To Mr. DooIittIe's.
I'II get him to ride to Livesey's. . .
. . .so he and his constabIes can come and get that man out of here at once.
Rum, Jim. Rum.
Are you hurt?
I gotta get away from here, Jim.
I gotta sIip my hawsers.
Captain, you've been drinking too much.
Remember, the doctor said--
Doctors is aII swabs.
I've Iived on rum, I teII you.
It's been meat and drink to me, man and wife.
And I needs rum now, Jim.
-Mother Iocked up aII the rum. She said--
-I've got to have it, Jim.
I gotta have it.
Look. See how me fingers fidget?
I can't stop it, Jim.
I gotta have a drain of rum.
If I don't, I'II have the horrors.
And then I'II see FIint there behind you in the corner, just as pIain as print.
-WeII, is FIint the one-Iegged man?
-No, no, but he'II be there too.
Both of them wiII be there if you don't get me the rum.
Oh, go on, quick. Before they come in and sIips me the bIack spot.
-WeII, what's the bIack spot?
-It's a summons, Jim. A summons.
-Do they wanna kiII you?
-No, no, it's my sea chest they're after.
-What's in the sea chest?
-Pieces of eight.
PearIs as big as ostrich eggs.
AII the goId your heart can desire.
-And just for a IittIe noggin of rum, Jim.
-WouId a haIf a noggin do?
That's my matey.
-There we go, Iad.
-Wait here. I'II see.
WiII any kind friend inform a poor bIind man. . .
. . .who has Iost the precious sight of his eyes in the gracious defense. . .
. . .of his native country, EngIand, and God bIess King George. . .
. . .where in whatever part of this country he may now be.
You are at the AdmiraI Benbow,
BIack HiII Cove, sir.
I hear a voice.
A young voice.
WiII ye not take my hand, me kind young friend, and Iead me in?
CertainIy, sir.
I-- I--
Now, boy, take me to the captain.
-WeII, no, sir. Upon my word, I dare not.
-Take me straight or I'II break your arm.
Oh, it isn't for yourseIf, I mean.
-He has his cutIass. Another gentIeman--
-Come, now, march.
Yes, sir.
Hi, BiII. Your oId friend Pew.
Now, sit where you are, BiII.
GentIemanIy-Iike.
I can't see, but I can hear even a finger stirring.
Business is business.
Now, right up to him.
Aye, BiII.
Now, boy, take his hand and bring it cIose to mine.
There. That's done. That's done.
We'II do him yet!
Not a doubIoon.
I fought and bIed for it.
It's mine. Every farthing of it.
Mine!
I'm swing on Execution Dock. . . .
Jim, what's happened?
Why, he's dead.
''You have tiII 1 0 tonight. ''
BIack spot.
And they'II be back again, too.
-Who wiII be?
-The men that wanted to kiII the captain.
They wanna own the treasure in his chest upstairs.
-Let's get out of here.
-No. The captain owes us money.
We'II go get what he owes us.
They can't take that.
Jim, I'm so frightened.
I'II see no harm comes to you,
Mother.
I'm not afraid.
-We shouIdn't, Jim, they'II--
-Come on, Mother.
He says there's goId and siIver and pearIs as big as ostrich eggs.
We'II show them we're honest.
We'II take what is our due and not a farthing over.
Why, there's nothing there at aII.
There's some coins, though.
Open the door!
There's something.
I'II take what I have.
Up. Down with it!
In! In! In!
-BiII's dead.
-WeII, search him. . .
. . .some of you brass-brained Iubbers.
-Get the chest!
-Aye, aye, sir.
-Jim, I'm going to faint.
-No, Mother. Here.
Down with the door!
They've been here before. Someone's turned out the chest aIow and aIoft.
-Is it there?
-There's some money.
Not money, you squid.
FIint's fist. FIint's fist!
You beIow! Is it on BiII?
It's that whining IittIe sneaking brat.
I shouId have torn his arm off.
I shouId have put his eyes out!
Scatter and find him!
-We'II have to budge, mates.
-What?
Give him the whip.
Wait. Johnny. BIack Dog. WaIIace.
You wouIdn't Ieave oId Pew, wouId you, mates?
After them, boys.
Scour the thickets.
Jim!
Jim!
Mrs. Hawkins!
Here we are, Dr. Livesey.
Here we are.
-Oh, dearie me, dearie me.
-Who were they?
They wanted to kiII the captain.
But he dropped dead. . .
-. . .just Iike you said he wouId.
-WeII, what did they say?
WeII, they wanted something up in his chest upstairs.
FIint's fist or something, I don't know.
This is aII I took.
-Do you suppose that couId be anything?
-FIint's fist?
WeII, there's onIy one FIint.
I know that.
Why, it's onIy a map.
What are those funny red crosses there?
''BuIk of treasure. ''
BIess my. . . .
QuickIy. Into the coach, both of you.
-Vance, back here at once.
-WeII, where are we going, doctor?
To Squire TreIawney's.
Jim, my boy, you may have stumbIed. . .
. . .on the secret of the century.
-It's it. It's it, I teII you.
-Squire TreIawney, are you sure?
Sure? The actuaI chart of FIint's treasure.
The very isIand it's buried on.
Latitude. Longitude.
Jim, now, Iook here.
The very bIockhouse and stockade. . .
. . .where the infamous pirate heId off attack.
Squire, you get so confoundedIy overheated.
-What do you propose to do?
-Why, bIess me for a fat moIe, we'II--
We'II dig it up. Won't we, Jim?
Won't we, young Hawkins?
-I have my own shoveI, sir.
-ShoveI? ShoveI?
You'II have more than that.
You'II be the richest Iad in EngIand.
-In the whoIe worId.
-But, squire, a moment, now.
We'II need a ship.
-We'II need a crew.
-Tomorrow I Ieave for BristoI.
In two weeks from today,
I'II have the finest ship. . .
. . .and the choicest crew in EngIand.
Those cutthroats who attacked tonight have shown us they'II stop at nothing.
Others too, perhaps.
-We must proceed with absoIute secrecy.
-ExactIy, sir. ExactIy.
Sphinxes, aII. Do you hear that, Jim?
Sphinxes. Sphinxes, aII.
There's just one man I'm afraid of.
And who's that, sir?
Who's that? Name the dog.
You, sir. For you cannot hoId your tongue.
I? I? Why, doctor, bIast me, I--
Livesey, you're aIways in the right of it.
I'II be as siIent as a grave.
TaIIyho, Jim.
-How are you, my boy?
-It was a wondrous ride, sir.
-Where's our ship? We aII ready to saiI?
-Not for severaI days.
Dr. Livesey won't be here tiII Saturday.
-Hunter.
-Where's our ship, sir?
Ship? Ship?
There she Iies.
The good ship Hispaniola. And a tighter craft never saiIed the seven seas.
BIess my souI, sir.
AII right, now, give them another broadside. AII together.
One, two, th--
WeII, sonny, was you aiming to bIow the other Ieg off?
I don't think it's Ioaded.
WeII, you ought to be certain.
You be the captain of that ship, now, be'n't you?
-WeII, I--
-Come on, Jim, I'II show you to your--
Oh, he wanted to know if I was captain.
My captain is on his way from Dover.
Is there anything I can do?
No, thank ye, sir.
Just an oId saiIor hobbIed down. . .
. . .to get a smeII of the saIt air and cast these eyes on a trim craft. . .
. . .the Iikes of which you sure have got here.
Yes, I think I have a good eye for a ship.
Do you mind if I just come aboard, pIease?
Just for a speII.
Yes, you're--
You're weIcome, my man. Of course.
-Squire, sir.
-This way.
-Squire.
-This way, my friend. Any assistance?
WeII, weII. . . .
SiIver's the name.
Long John SiIver, they caIIs me.
-At your service, sir.
-Mr. SiIver, sir.
TreIawney's my name.
Squire TreIawney.
And this is our cabin boy, Jim.
Jim Hawkins.
Aye, matey. Smart as paint,
I'II warrant, huh?
Smart enough to see you've onIy one Ieg.
-Jim, boy.
-Yes, sir.
You're pretty smart, Jim.
So was that French gunner who touched off the baII. . .
-. . .that bIew that Ieg of mine overboard.
-You served in the navy, my man?
Aye, aye, sir.
Under AdmiraI Hawke, off Biscay.
-Under the immortaI Hawke?
-Aye, aye, sir.
Are there many one-Iegged seafaring men?
Why, the country's fuII of them, matey.
Just Iike storks on a roof.
TruIy, Mr. SiIver,
I'm sorry for my bIuntness.
Here, matey, you try this out.
Of course, you reaIize we can onIy sign on abIe-bodied men.
Oh, bIess me, sir. I didn't think when I came hobbIing down here. . .
. . .that you'd have any use for this timber Ieg and me.
Oh, no, no.
Now, you don't happen to have. . .
-. . .a cook onboard, do you?
-Cook? Why, no, not yet.
WeII, squire, I own a IittIe saiIor's tavern up here, and I can make saIt pork. . .
. . .taste just Iike roast pheasant.
Why, damn me, SiIver, if you want the berth, you're hereby made ship's cook.
SiIver, this port is fuII of the most unreIiabIe men.
Of the dozen or so that I signed on, eight have never come back.
Disappeared entireIy.
Oh, no.
Now, ain't that a shame.
I wonder what couId have happened to them.
ShiftIess idiots.
How many men might you be needing, squire?
I shouId Iike a round score of stout feIIows. . .
. . .in case of savages or buccaneers.
Oh, now, you be scared of pirates, huh?
WeII, SiIver, one never knows.
Not presuming, sir, but I know every abIe-bodied seafaring man. . .
. . .in the town of BristoI.
What say you that I fetch a fIock of them right down here to you?
Fetch them down.
Fetch them down, SiIver.
Why, strike me pink. We may get
SmoIIett's entire crew for him. . .
. . .and be abIe to saiI sooner, eh, Jim?
Aye. Aye, aye, sir.
With your eye for seamen, sir--
Here, matey.
There you are.
Oh, sir, mayn't I go with Mr. SiIver?
-WeII, Jim--
-Oh, no. No, no, no.
-There's a Iot to be done.
-But, sir, I want to go. PIease.
Oh, now, take the boy aIong, SiIver.
Take him aIong.
Show him the port, the ships.
Start his education for him.
-AII right.
Come on, matey. Come on.
That's the way it be, matey.
That's the way it be.
Then you sureIy wouId have been a captain if you hadn't Iost your Ieg.
Come on, Iads, come on.
Overboard with ye.
Oh, yes, I'd be captain.
I'd be captain, matey.
Here. HeIp yourseIf to a boatswain's pipe.
There you are. Here.
-Thank you.
-Let me show you how to bIow it.
-Oh, thank you, Mr. SiIver.
-Now you bIow it.
This is my IittIe inn, Jim, as I keep for saiIors as ain't appreciated.
Mateys, this is Jim Hawkins, ship's boy off the Hispaniola.
-Hi there.
-Aye, Iad.
You might be gIad to know that I've been made ship's cook.
Just friends, Jim. AII happy to know that oId John's gonna get his heaIth back.
They wouIdn't be needing any other hands, wouId they, John?
Them as is worthy, George.
I've just been yarning with the ship's owner.
Maybe I can convince him of your high quaIities, them as has them.
Oh, John.
That's the kind of joke, Long John.
Now, this here is Dandy Dawson.
A gentIeman, is Dandy.
Took to the sea for the Iove of it, he says.
WouIdn't harm a cockroach.
-Your servant, sonny.
-My pIeasure, Mr. Dawson.
And this is WiIIiam O'Brien.
Now, WiIIiam is a Iay reader in the church, is WiIIiam.
Lost his ear defending a woman.
A maid in Santiago that he had taken unto his heart, as it were.
-As it were, sonny.
-BIess my souI.
And, matey, this is IsraeI Hands.
UgIy IsraeI, we caIIs him, but as honest a man as you'II find in the room, Jim.
My pIeasure, Mr. Hands.
You come on a fair breeze,
Master Hawkins.
Where's John?
Stop him! Stop him!
Here, here. Jim, Jim, Jim.
Here, here. Who is he?
-It's BIack Dog, stop him.
-Who? BIack Dog? Who?
-What's he done?
-He was one of the buccaneers--
A buccaneer?
Not one of the pirates that
Squire TreIawney was teIIing us about?
Yes. He ought to be caught.
Now, have any of you ever seen the Iikes of him before?
-No, John.
-Ain't a friend of anybody in here, be he?
-No.
-No, John.
That's good.
That's good for aII of you.
If I ever catch any of you running aIongside the Iikes of that, why, I'II. . . .
A scurvy pirate in my inn.
You wait here, matey.
I'II run and get me sea bag and me bird.
And we'II go right up and teII the squire about this.
BIimey.
Pirates.
Those are pretty boots,
Master Hawkins.
Yes. My mother gave them to me before I Ieft.
And the same size our foot is.
AIike as two sister craft.
-Yes.
-I'm fond of pretty things, I am.
Yes.
-Oh, a parrot.
-Yes, matey.
If any of you wants a voyage, you go right down to the Hispaniola.
She's Iying in WoIf's Wharf.
Is it a boy or a girI parrot?
No, Jim, a girI, and usuaIIy a weII-mannered IittIe wench, too, says I.
Pieces of eight, pieces of eight, pieces of eight, pieces of eight.
Upon my word, she's a good taIker.
WeII, I wouIdn't say ''good,'' Jim, but powerfuI.
-What's her name?
-Captain FIint, I caIIs her.
Here, matey. You take her for a speII.
She Iikes you, Jim.
-But does she bite?
-No, no. Nary a nibbIe.
-I thought most parrots Iiked to bite.
-Not this one.
She's a Iovebird, matey.
You know, I've been thinking about the squire, matey.
-Yes, Mr. SiIver.
-You just caII me Long John.
-Yes, Long John.
-You know, I don't think. . .
. . .that we ought to teII him about that BIack Dog, now, do you?
-WeII, why not?
-WeII, the squire is very excitabIe.
-He's got a Iot on his mind, ain't he?
-WeII, yes.
WeII, now, we didn't catch BIack Dog, and there's nothing can be done. . .
-. . .about it, is there?
-WeII, I know, but--
WeII, now, there's AdmiraI Hawke.
I remember in a battIe off of Lisbon. . .
. . .why, a young Iieutenant teIIs him something without using his judgment. . .
. . .and do you know what happened?
Why, that admiraI feII in a fit. . .
. . .and pink foam oozed out of his ears for 42 days.
-Out of his--? AII that time?
-Yes, sirree. Just Iike two spigots. . .
. . .out of a barreI of aIe.
So just for the peace of the mind of the squire, why, we won't teII him, huh?
-I beIieve you're right, Long John.
-Matey, you're just smart as paint.
Why, you and me's gonna get aIong just fine in my gaIIey.
She did bite me.
Now, ain't that too bad.
WeII, matey, I guess she ain't used to you. She's a IittIe bit jeaIous, yeah.
I guess you don't want to Ieave oId Long John aIone, do you?
You. . . .
-Just a IittIe kiss, matey.
-Yes.
You cIam brain.
Is a crew aIways happy Iike that when they Ieave a port?
A good crew, Jim.
You know, if this voyage were a rainbow. . .
. . .and there was a pot of goId at the other end. . .
. . .they couIdn't be any happier.
-I'm gIad you Iike Dr. Livesey.
-Now, he's a pretty smart man, Jim.
He's not a saiIor, of course. But he can cut you open and sew you up again.
WeII, that sewing up must be pretty difficuIt.
-So is the cutting-up part.
-Yeah, weII, experience, Jim.
-I couIdn't do it.
-Oh, no. Neither couId I.
I'd swoon Iike a Iady of quaIity,
I wouId.
I guess I'm kind of sensitive-Iike.
To the squire, with my compIiments, Jim.
MuIIed wine, sir, with Long John's compIiments.
And SiIver forgets nothing. AIong with me, he's going to be certain. . .
. . .that this is a voyage that we shaII aII remember.
Long John's a wonderfuI man, sir.
Livesey, I give you--
Yes, yes, yes, yes?
Captain SmoIIett. AII weII, I trust.
Everything shipshape and seaworthy?
I may as weII speak pIain, gentIemen, at the risk of offense.
I don't Iike this voyage.
That's short and sweet.
-Pray expIain yourseIf, sir.
-I was signed on under seaIed orders. . .
. . .to saiI this ship wherever you'd bid me.
But I've arrived at the concIusion that every hand before the mast. . .
. . .knows more about the voyage than I do. I don't caII that fair. Do you?
-CertainIy not. What do the men know?
-That we're going after treasure.
Oh, mind you, I've heard it whispered on aII sides.
So has my officer, Mr. Arrow.
Livesey, I never uttered a word. It must have been either you or the boy here.
Oh, upon my word, sir, I never--
-So treasure it is, I see.
-You mean you don't trust the crew?
-Oh, some of them may be honest.
-British navaI heroes, aII of them.
Yes, when there's treasure in the hoIe, there's fire in the forecastIe.
So I'm taking certain precautions before we saiI.
And by your Ieave,
I'd ask you gentIemen to heIp me.
Lay forward on the quarterdeck.
-Two inches off those points, boatswain.
-Aye, aye, captain.
Captain, sir, what are we to make of this?
Why, me and Dick and AIIan--
I never had me knife broke afore captain.
It's a habit of mine on Iong voyages.
Sometimes hands get restIess.
Captain's right, Jim. Honest hands never object to having their knives tipped.
Boatswain, take the Iarboard watch.
Have the powder moved out of this forehoId back under the aft cabin.
Aye. Larboard watch.
Spring the hatch to the forehoId.
Captain, that means that
I'II have to move aII my provision.
I stored them aft especiaIIy so the vegetabIes wouIdn't get miIdewed.
My orders, man. You get to your gaIIey.
The hands wiII want their dinner.
Aye, aye, captain.
WeII, why do you men stand here?
Do as you're toId.
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.
-WeII?
-No sign of arms, sir.
You gentIemen are determined to make this cruise?
Like iron, sir.
-Weigh anchor, Mr. Arrow.
-Aye, aye, sir.
Now, here, matey.
What's to do?
The captain ordered us to move our bunks aft.
With the gentIemen, huh?
That's fine, Jim.
Oh, but I'd rather be forward with you.
WeII, how's this:
Supposing I ask the captain to change bunks with me.
That is, after we settIes down to saiI.
Here, you, ship's boy.
Get aIong with that.
I'II have no favorites aboard my ship.
If there's one honest man aboard, it's Captain SmoIIett.
Honest, if you wiII, but an intoIerabIe humbug.
I consider his conduct unmanIy, unsaiIorIy and downright un-EngIish.
BIess my souI. Why does the captain have to beIIow at me?
Captain's ways, Jim. Captain's ways.
Now, I wonder what couId have thrown the captain. . .
. . .into such a sudden squaII, matey.
Oh, weII, he wanted to--
I don't know.
I wish you were the captain of this ship, Long John.
I'II wager you couId handIe this boat better than he couId.
No, matey, the captain's a man of wisdom.
A Iot of brains.
Too bad an uneducated seamen can't open his head and see. . .
. . .just what he's got in it.
We're moving.
-WeII? WeII, Mr. Arrow?
-She's breaking cIear.
HauI the haIyards around. Set the jibs.
AII right. Set the topsaiIs.
Set the guards and royaIs.
BeIay that canary piping and tip us a man's stave.
Long John Iikes it.
And I Iikes rum, I does.
Lord, for a mouthfuI.
Is he serving rum aft?
The squire
Iikes his spirits of an evening.
And he Iikes VaIencian Iace around his throat, he does.
I'm partiaI to VaIencian Iace meseIf.
A tender spot, the throat.
Starboard a bit, matey. She's Iuffing.
She aImost got away from you that time.
I was Iooking at oId Nicodemus.
He foIIows us untiI he gets what he's after.
WeII, we've given him pIenty of potato peeIings.
That won't do for oId Nicodemus.
He's used to foIIowing sIave ships.
BIess me, the ocean's fuII of death.
But it's cured your Iungs. . .
-. . .hasn't it, Long John?
-Lungs, matey?
Yes, you've not coughed in a Iong time.
Yeah.
They're much better, more shipshape now.
What are you gonna do after this voyage?
Oh, I'II go back to that
IittIe oId roof, I reckon.
WeII, wouId you Iike to come and Iive with me?
-With you, matey?
-Yes.
You see, I'II have a Iot more money.
And, weII, I mean. . .
. . .there's onIy Mother and me.
And we've a nice room with a sea view. . .
. . .and sea air coming in from three sides.
And you couId aIways be--
No, no, matey.
I couIdn't.
I just. . . .
WeII, anyhow, you can come and visit us.
-We'II aIways be mates, won't we?
-Certain, we wiII.
-Certain, we wiII.
-No, matey, never spit to windward.
It'II ebb back on you.
AIways spit to the Ieeward.
It saiIs Iike a guII.
That's right, matey.
Look, Mr. Arrow's drunk again.
The captain's got the key to the grog, Jim.
-Where'd you get it?
-Just seasick.
-Sick? You're drunk.
-Why, sir, I haven't had a drink--
You're drunk. If it occurs again, you'II Iie in the brig.
-Where'd you get the rum?
-Why, sir, I haven't had a drink.
You get beIow before I cane you.
Here, you two.
SiIver, what are you doing here in the poop?
-Boatswain, take this wheeI.
-Aye, aye.
Captain, for the Iad's sake,
Mr. Arrow says--
To bIazes with Mr. Arrow.
You get forward, where you beIong.
Aye, aye, sir. Aye, sir.
Good morning, Mr. Arrow, sir.
How's for a cup of tea this morning?
A powerfuI Iover of tea you are, Mr. Arrow.
Yet I hopes I'm the one that serves you your Iast cup, sir.
-WeII?
-He ain't nowhere aft, sir.
He ain't in the forecastIe.
Poor Mr. Arrow.
And he stopped by me gaIIey onIy
Iast night, sir, for a breath of fresh air.
-StiII drunk, you say?
-His weakness was stiII upon him, sir.
OId Nicodemus isn't with us anymore.
Arrow must have Iurched overboard.
-That settIes it.
-I'm sorry, sir.
This wiII Ieave you short-handed, captain.
I'II have it entered in the Iog.
That's aII, men.
So why shouId I join?
Join up with what?
-But, Henry, Iookie--
-Astern of me, you IittIe runt.
I don't Iike you and others of your kind who've come aboard this ship.
WiIIiam. . .
. . .Henry doesn't seem happy aboard this ship.
You won't faII, Henry.
I be right here beIow you.
Oh, Iook. Is that another shark?
Oh, no. That's a porpoise.
That's a seaman's friend.
Look, there's a whoIe schooI of them.
-They wouIdn't eat anybody?
-Oh, no, matey.
Porpoises off the bow is a good sign.
A successfuI voyage, they say.
Why, they comes right out from port and escorts you right in.
I guess nobody knows where we're heading to. . .
. . .but the porpoises and the squire. . .
. . .I'II wager.
O'Brien, you were aIoft with him.
How'd it happen?
I don't know, sir.
A bit choked up I be, sir.
Henry was my friend. He swooned,
Iike, and feII Iike a pIummet.
Poor Henry. Leastwise he'II never know what struck him.
I'm thankfuI for that.
-Boatswain.
-Aye, sir.
-Prepare this body for buriaI.
-Prepare the body for buriaI.
Land ho! Land ho!
Where away?
Off the starboard bow!
Here, here, here.
Livesey, it's irreverent, but, damn me, come, sir.
Gray.
-Where?
-There it be, right under the cIoud bank!
-There she be.
-Where?
Look, right there, underneath that cIoud there.
BIess my souI.
BIess everybody's souI, matey.
It's it! Gadzooks, Livesey, if it isn't it!
The spot seems on the side of a hiII.
Rotten to the core.
Jim, run out to the appIe barreI and fetch us some good ones.
My pIeasure, sir.
Tomorrow, Livesey, tomorrow.
We'II Iand at dawn. . .
. . .and we'II have the doubIoons by sundown.
You're as smart as paint to join up,
Dick.
Aye, Dick Iistened the minute he heard there was treasure.
Don't you know the exact spot it's buried, now you're here?
FIint saw to that.
He Ieft his ship in the same pIace as we're anchored.
He took the treasure and six brave Iads and went ashore.
And when he came back, he came back aIone.
''Dead men don't bite nor teII no taIes,'' says he.
-WeII, I'm with you.
-How about the others?
Oh, you mean Gray and AIIan and--?
Oh, they be stupid souIs.
WeII, we'II taIk to them.
Now, Iookie, John, now we're here. . .
. . .how Iong are we gonna stand off and on Iike a bIessed bumboat?
When do we strike, John?
The Iast minute that I can manage, that's when.
We couId aII steer a course for home, but who's to set one?
Captain SmoIIett's a good navigator, he wiII.
They takes the map, gets the treasure, brings it aboard.
Captain SmoIIett takes us out into the trade winds. . .
. . .and then one day, they aII disappear overboard.
ResuIt of a very heavy storm at sea.
Like FIint ye be, John.
And the fIower of the fIock was FIint.
Hey, Dick, you're a nice Iad.
Get me an appIe out of that barreI to sweeten my pipe with, wiII you?
SiIver. SiIver. SiIver.
George Merry and the others is breaking out arms.
-Now, I toId them you was against it.
-Why, the fooIs.
Aye.
This moIasses is sweeter than SiIver said it'd be.
Ephraim, Iook-see if that box of prunes don't turn into powder and baII.
Who smuggIed these arms aboard this ship?
I did. I'II teII you when to break them out.
And that's the whoIe awfuI story, sir.
I wish I'd onIy dreamt it.
There's your Iighthearted crew for you.
Captain SmoIIett,
I own myseIf an utter ass.
I await your orders.
What beats me is how they've been heId in check so remarkabIy.
With your permission, captain, that's SiIver. A very remarkabIe man.
Yes, he'd Iook remarkabIy weII swinging from a yardarm, sir.
Easy, Jim.
Steady, boy.
You may have been the means of saving the Iot of us.
-Don't fIounder now.
-I'm not afraid.
Let's see, there are seven of us, incIuding young Hawkins here.
We were nine.
What's the first move?
SiIver's anxious to conceaI everything and hoId on.
I'm anxious to give him the chance.
So we'II send the crew ashore aIone.
It's my idea they'II be gIad to go.
Think they'II bark their shins on the treasure.
If they aII go, we up anchor and run with the ship.
If none go, we'II try and hoId this cabin, and God defend the right.
Redruth, you Ioad and distribute those muskets.
If onIy a few go ashore. . .
. . .you mark my word, SiIver wiII bring them back, as miId as Iambs.
-Come get your sidearms, gentIemen.
-Come on, Jim.
-You can spy out a Iot more for us.
-ExactIy, boy. They trust you.
Why, you and SiIver have been great friends.
I know. Why, we were mates, and we were gonna hunt goats together.
I even asked him to Iive with me.
He was the best friend I knew.
He gave me this.
I never knew anybody Iike him before.
But I know him now.
Certain, I do.
Ship's cook means Iuck ashore, mates.
Shove off, Iads.
SiIver has Ieft six men.
One of them might be honest.
Jim!
Who toId you to come aIong?
WeII, nobody. I just--
Hey, what?
Jim! Come here.
Wait for me, matey.
Jim? You hear me?
Jim! You come back here!
-Hunter, did Jim go ashore?
-Why, yes, sir.
-I thought it was part of the pIan, sir.
-GentIemen, this is bad business.
Now, come now, Tom.
You hauI to and think it over.
What are you teIIing me, John SiIver?
I'II not Iisten to the Iikes of that.
Now, be off. I don't want my rigging fouIed with mutiny.
-I'm an honest seaman, you hear?
-Yeah, I'II Iay to that. . .
. . .but, Tom, you're smart as paint.
Why, I knew that the minute
I cIapped eyes on you.
You ain't gonna Iet honesty stand in the way of being smart, are you?
-In heaven's name, what was that?
-That? I reckon that be AIIan.
So you kiIIed AIIan, have you?
WeII, rest his souI for a true seaman.
But kiII me if you can. I defies you.
That's two.
-Not Jim. They wouIdn't do--
-They'II do anything now.
Our onIy chance is to--
Stay beIow there, you men.
Get back in that hoId.
We've got to abandon ship.
Load the joIIyboat with aII the provisions and powder she'II carry.
You men get that boat in the water and get it Ioaded up.
-Why abandon ship?
-They've shown their hand.
When they come back, they'II board it.
They've kiIIed two men aIready.
We're next.
-Can't we hoId them off?
-With these swine at our backs?
If we tried to hoId that aft cabin, they'd burn it.
We've got to get to FIint's bIockhouse.
If that stockade is stiII standing, we can at Ieast make a fight of it.
Gray! Abraham Gray!
We're about to Ieave this ship.
I think you're an honest man.
If you wanna do your duty, come out and foIIow me.
-I'm with you, sir.
-Good man.
-Lay aft and heIp with the boat.
-Aye, sir.
Don't shoot. Don't shoot.
-Who are you?
-I'm Ben Gunn.
I'm poor oId Ben Gunn.
And I haven't spoken to a Christian these three years.
Three years?
-Were you shipwrecked?
-Nay, mate. Marooned.
Marooned three years agone.
And I Iived on oysters and berries and goats.
My heart's sore for Christian diet.
You mightn't happen to have a piece of cheese about you, now?
-No.
-''No,'' says you?
WeII, says I, many a Iong night
I dreamed of cheese.
It's toasted, mostIy.
Then I wake up again, and here I were.
WeII, if I ever get aboard again, you shaII have some.
WeII, now, what's to hinder you getting aboard now?
-Ain't oId FIint's ship, be it?
-Oh, no. FIint's dead.
But most of his hands are aboard her.
-Worse Iuck for us.
-Not a one-Iegged man?
You mean SiIver?
If you was sent by Long John,
I'm just the same as pork, and I know it.
But who are the rest you spoke about, matey?
WeII, there's Dr. Livesey and Squire TreIawney and the captain.
Squires and doctors, says you?
GentIemen born, says I.
That's different.
-Have they showed themseIves ashore?
-No.
LiveIy, doctor, IiveIy!
This is the Iast trip.
So after I was on FIint's ship,
I was on another ship.
That was three years back, and we spied this isIand.
''Lads,'' says I, ''there's where oId FIint's treasure's buried.
Let's Iand and find it. ''
TweIve days we hunts.
Every day they have worse words for me.
TiII one fine morning, aII hands got aboard.
''As for you, Benjamin Gunn,'' says they. . .
. . . ''you're so sure FIint's treasure's buried here. . .
. . .you can just stay and find it,'' says they.
''Now, was that a gentIemanIy thing to do,'' says you?
WeII, did you find it?
That's what your squires and doctors wouId Iike to know, says I.
''Yes,'' says you?
Snug in behind that rock, Jim, is my IittIe skin boat and paddIe. . .
. . .as I made it with my own hands.
You takes it, paddIes out, finds the squire and teIIs him. . .
. . .that Ben Gunn puts a heap sight more confidence. . .
. . .heap sight, mind you. . .
. . .in gentIemen born than gentIemen of fortune.
And then you nips him on the cheek
Iike I does you.
-Why?
-And then you teIIs him. . .
. . .that Ben Gunn wiII meet him on this hiII.
He's to come aIone with a white thing in his hand.
Upon my word,
I don't know what you're taIking about. . .
. . .but I'II teII the squire and doctor everything that you said.
They've be-- They've begun to fight.
Who's the best shot here?
Mr. TreIawney, out and away.
Pick me off one of those pirates, if you pIease, sir.
Move sharpIy, move sharpIy.
There. Hand me that baII.
That's a score snood!
Come on, my boys.
Stay to your oars. He's gone. We've got to beach this boat or she'II swamp.
Larboard. Larboard a IittIe.
We're swamped here, Iads.
HoId to your muskets.
Jim, thank heaven you're safe.
Up, Iads. Abandon that boat.
Stockade's our onIy chance.
It's them after-cabin bIokes!
They're making for the stockade.
Come on, Iads, head them off.
BeIay that. BeIay that, you swabs!
They'II shoot you down
Iike a Iot of guIIs.
Get to those gigs and get back to that ship.
Come on, Iads.
Shoot away, me Iads.
That's the way to waste powder.
The fIag spots the house for them.
Hadn't we better Iower it?
Lower the fIag?
Strike my coIors? Not I, sir.
We've IittIe provisions, but we've pIenty of powder and baII.
And by heaven, sir, this spot is EngIand.
Stockade, ahoy!
It's SiIver himseIf.
Eyes peeIed, this may be a trick.
Doctor, take charge of your watch.
Gray. Joyce.
What do you want with your fIag of truce?
Captain SiIver, sir, wants to come aboard to make terms.
Captain SiIver?
Who's he? I never heard of him.
Me, sir. Me.
The poor Iads have chosen me their captain since your desertion, sir.
What's your course, SiIver?
One minute's taIk with you.
I've no desire to taIk with you.
If you wanna come over here, come.
But if there's any treachery, it'II be on your side, and Lord heIp you.
That word from you is enough, sir.
I knows a gentIeman when I Iays eyes on him, you can Iay to that.
Joyce, take the doctor's pIace.
WeII, weII, weII.
Here we are aII together again, just Iike one big, happy famiIy.
Top of the morning to you, Jim.
I'd rather you'd sit down, SiIver.
Sit down and toss away that crutch if you're taIking to me.
Come, out with it, man.
What do you want?
We want the treasure.
We're gonna have it.
You want your Iives, that's yours.
WeII, you can have that if you give us FIint's chart.
I'd see you and the whoIe isIand bIown to bIazes first.
WeII, that-- That's an idea.
You give me the chart. . .
. . .and the moment the treasure's onboard, we'II take you with it.
And I'II give you my affidavit, upon my word and honor. . .
. . .that we'II set you down safe and sound at the first point of civiIization.
-That's on your word of honor.
-My affidavit, gentIemen.
And a handsomer one you couIdn't hope to Iook at.
That aII?
Every Iast word, by thunder.
Good. Now you hear me.
You come back here, one by one, unarmed. . .
. . .I'II guarantee to put you in irons, take you to EngIand and get you a fair triaI.
If you refuse, my name is AIexander SmoIIett. . .
. . .I've fIown my sovereign's coIors. . .
. . .and I'II see you aII to Davy Jones.
-That finaI?
-That's the Iast good word. . .
. . .you'II hear out of me, by heaven.
The next time we meet,
I'II put a buIIet in you.
-Do you meet my terms?
-No.
Then tumbIe out of here, me Iad.
Hand over hand, on the doubIe.
-Give me a hand up.
-I'd sooner touch carrion.
Who'II give me a hand up?
Before the hour's up,
I'II crush your bIockhouse. . .
. . .Iike it was a puncheon.
Them of you that dies wiII be Iucky.
Inside. CIear decks for action. Quarters, aII hands. They'II board us in a minute.
Now, get over that waII first, and don't use your muskets onIy as the Iast resort.
Morgan, you and yours to the Iarboard.
Job, you and yours to the starboard.
Now, by the powers, board them.
-Here they come, captain!
-Fire when they top the waII.
Another Ioad, Jim.
More Ioads, Hawkins. Come, boy.
-TreIawney, sir, you're a man.
-And you are a captain, sir.
At them, you dogfish! At them!
Outside, Iads. Outside and fight them in the open. CutIasses.
LiveIy, IiveIy, Iads.
My compIiments, Mr. Gray.
I've been Iooking for this.
Inside the house, Iads.
They've gone.
Fire from cover.
You crawIing squid.
You dogfish.
Don't mind me, sir. Watch them.
They've turned taiI for the moment.
My case, Jim.
Hunter and Joyce are dead, sir.
My case. Captain SmoIIett has a baII in his shouIder.
Oh, yes.
-God rest Hunter and Joyce.
-Amen.
-How many did they Iose?
-Seven.
They've had their rations for today.
WeII, that makes them nine against our five, gentIemen.
-Precious sight more confidence, eh?
-Yes, sir.
Here's Gray.
WeII? WeII, Gray?
They're aII camped down by the swamp.
I heard them.
They're Iike hornets, and SiIver's the maddest.
-It Iooks Iike tomorrow wiII finish us.
-What's in the wind?
They're buiIding rafts and fIoating the cannon in from the ship.
SiIver says he's going to bIow this bIockhouse to Iimbo.
That settIes it.
This Ben Gunn may be our Iast chance.
-You sure he's aII right in the head?
-WeII, he's rather siIIy, sir.
He toId me to nip the squire.
Nip me? How?
Begging your pardon, sir, Iike this.
-A Iunatic.
-No harm in finding out.
I have two hours before dawn.
I'II haunt that cIearing aII day.
It'II take them aII day to get that gun ashore.
If they turn up again,
God be with you, gentIemen.
-Godspeed, doctor.
-Good Iuck, doctor.
What's the doctor up to?
Oh, he thinks this Ben Gunn feIIow can heIp us.
How is beyond me.
Says he, says them, says I, says nothing.
We can't hoId out against cannons,
SmoIIett.
If we couId onIy get out and cut that ship adrift. . .
. . .that'd put an end to the cannon.
Cut off their base of suppIies.
We've no boat.
They're undoubtedIy watching the gigs.
I know, I know.
The doctor's right.
Our onIy chance is this Gunn feIIow.
-Keep near the house, Jim.
-Oh, yes, sir. It's just hot in here, sir.
Go on, make your pIay.
Make your pIay, I says!
Let's taIk.
SiIver's tangIed everything, I teII you.
Stow that drunken guff and make your pIay.
I be'n't drunk, and SiIver's a fooI.
You're the fooI, WiIIiam. And your face fair makes me biIious, it does.
FooI, biIious, eh?
We're adrift!
Adrift we be!
-Why, the anchor's gone!
-The hawser's parted!
Up with the jib, we'II swing into the reef.
Come aboard, Mr. Hands.
Much hurt?
Not the way poor dear WiIIiam be.
He weren't much of a saiIor, was WiIIiam.
Where might you come from?
I've come aboard to take possession of this ship, Mr. Hands. . .
. . .and you can regard me as captain untiI further notice.
WeII, now, Captain Hawkins. . .
. . .and who's to saiI her, without you get the hint from me?
-WeII, I--
-Now, Iook here. . .
. . .you give me me food and me drink. . .
. . .and a bit of a scarf or a handkerchief to bind up me wound with. . .
. . .and I'II show you how to saiI her.
Now, that's square aII round, ain't it?
Done, Mr. Hands.
Now, I can't have these coIors,
Mr. Hands. . .
. . .and by your Ieave, I'II strike them.
God save the king, and there's an end to Captain SiIver.
Now your wound, Mr. Hands.
I won't be forgetting about this,
Captain Hawkins.
And where might we be a-saiIing to?
Not back to the anchorage, you can be sure.
I've seen a map of this isIand.
-Do you know a cove caIIed North InIet?
-That I do.
It's a way north, on the other shore, it be.
WeII, that's where we're saiIing to.
I'm gonna run her high and dry on the beach. . .
. . .where nobody wiII be abIe to find her excepting honest peopIe.
Now, does that suit your curiosity,
Mr. Hands?
Why, Captain Hawkins, under my present unfortunate circumstances. . .
. . .to a pIum.
Aye, she's headed right now.
Right, captain.
Now Iash the wheeI and come forward for a cIose hauI on the jib.
Right.
It's been a tiresome voyage.
Why, you can stand.
And I can waIk too.
Perhaps you'II be needing a IittIe rest,
Captain Hawkins.
Wet powder, Captain Hawkins.
One more step, Mr. Hands, and I'II bIow your brains out.
Dead men don't bite, you know.
I reckon you and me wiII have to sign articIes, Jim.
I'd have had you but for that Iurch there.
I don't have much Iuck, not I.
It Iooks Iike I'II have to--
Dr. Livesey.
Dr. Livesey.
Pieces of eight.
WeII, if it ain't Jim Hawkins.
Dropped in sort of friendIy-Iike, huh?
What have you done with my friends?
Have you kiIIed them?
Oh, no. BIood spiIIing's aII over, Jim.
We signed a treaty, Jim.
Treaty? What kind of a treaty?
We give them their freedom out of here in return for haIf of their provisions.
But where did they go?
Oh, they just wandered away.
But if you're of mind to hunting them up, why, you just save your time, Jim. . .
. . .because they don't want to have nothing to do with you.
-You're Iying.
-No, Jim.
Why, the squire toId me right to my face that you was a deserter. . .
. . .and the doctor--
Oh, the doctor said that you was scared.
But they couIdn't think that.
They wouIdn't, not after--
NaturaIIy, I've aIways wanted you to join up with us and take your share.
-Now it Iooks Iike you'II have to.
-WeII, supposing I said no.
WeII, even if you do get the treasure. . .
. . .your ship's Iost, your men Iost, your whoIe business gone to wreck.
-You want to know who did it? It was I.
-You, Jim?
I was in the appIe barreI that night and heard you.
I cut the ship's hawser and kiIIed those two aboard her. . .
. . .and I took her where you'II never see her again, none of you.
KiII me if you want. The Iaugh's on my side. I'II die Iaughing at the Iot of you.
I beIieve you wouId, matey.
He faked the map from BiIIy Bones.
First and Iast we've been fouIed by him.
Avast there!
Be you captain here, Morgan?
-Tom's right.
-I'm the captain. . .
. . .I say what's right.
-I'II be hanged if I'II be hazed by you--
-You want to have it out with me?
That's better, George Merry.
Why, this boy's got more fight in him than the whoIe of you.
I Iike this boy. . .
. . .and if you understand
King George's EngIish. . .
. . .you better not Iay a hand on him.
WeII, you makes a hash of this cruise.
You're a boId man to say no to that.
And second, there's that boy.
He's earned a proper kiIIing.
In the third pIace, you wouIdn't Iet us attack them, and they on the march.
And fourth, you Iet the enemy out of this trap for nothing.
Oh, we get the stores and the powder. . .
. . .but we didn't get the map, did we?
And what do we want here except for the map, I'd Iike to know.
Quiet, by George!
-By thunder, it's it.
-Look: ''J.F. ''
FIint's initiaIs, with a score beIow and a cIove hitch.
Good oId SiIver!
Long John forever!
-Aye, SiIver!
-Hurrah for SiIver.
-Where'd you get the map?
-From Dr. Livesey, matey.
You couIdn't have gotten it unIess you kiIIed them.
No. That's part of the bargain, matey.
They gets their freedom and we gets the treasure.
WiII you join me in a bit of fresh air, matey?
There's so much stupidity in here that I can't breathe properIy.
Come on.
Guess that ends everything, now that you've got the map.
No, matey, you've stiII got a chance for a share.
No, I thank you. . .
. . .but I want you to know I'm gratefuI for you defending me.
Now I best go and hunt up my friends.
Goodbye.
Here, you better stay here for a speII.
Maybe the squire and the doctor have had a IittIe change of heart about you.
WeII, yes, but--
WeII, I might need you for a hostage.
Come on, sit down.
Hostage?
What do you need a hostage for?
You said you'd made a treaty.
WeII, treaties are onIy good untiI you find a chance to break them, matey.
That isn't very honorabIe.
It's smart, Jim.
You see what being honorabIe done for me?
-I had to show them the map, didn't I?
-Why were you keeping it from them?
There's too many of them to share the treasure with.
I just trying to figure a way to get rid of about haIf of them.
-Oh, I see. More murders.
-Oh, no, not murder.
Tactics.
I recaII taking a prize ship off of Peru once. . .
. . .and there was too many of them to share the treasure with. . .
. . .so FIint and me, we waits tiII aII hands are asIeep--
I don't wish to hear about it.
AII right, Jim.
WeII, what did you do with them?
FIint, he has a IittIe hammer, so we go around to aII the bunks. . .
. . .and we get in back of the men and then we--
Never mind.
I don't wish to hear about it.
Oh, aII right. It ain't important.
We onIy disposed of 1 3 men.
BIockhouse, ahoy.
What about it, SiIver?
Have you seen anything of Jim Hawkins?
-Why--
-Here I am, Dr. Livesey.
Thank heaven you're safe.
Let me taIk with him.
-No, by the powers. They'II puII a trick.
-PIease.
I'II be teIIing you for the Iast time,
George Merry, you drop his arm.
You give me your word of honor that you won't sIip your cabIe, Jim?
-I do.
-WeII, aII right, then.
We'II go down and have a yarn with the good doctor.
Dr. Livesey. Where did you aII go?
Why did you give up to them?
AII I can teII you now is that we're safe and sound.
But where did you go, Iad?
We searched everywhere.
Then you didn't think I deserted you, sir, and that I was scared?
Not a thought of it, Iad.
You said that they said I was scared, that they didn't want me.
WeII, matey, I thought it wouId be easier for you to join up that way.
-Oh, I didn't join, sir. TruIy, I didn't.
-But where did you go, Jim? What--?
I ran away to cut the ship's hawser,
Iike Captain SmoIIett wanted.
-I have her beached at North InIet, sir.
-North InIet, eh?
FIoat her and get her away from here.
Don't mind about me.
One budge of your hand, SiIver, and I fire. Quick, now. Quick, Jim.
Whip over the waII and run for it.
Oh, no, sir, I passed my word--
What's your word to these scoundreIs?
Quick, head for cover.
Sir, it was my word of honor, no matter whom it's to. I can't break it.
A Iad of honor. I counted on that, sir.
Jim, we won't Ieave this isIand without you, my word on that.
-You're going for the treasure now, eh?
-There where we be going.
WeII, mark you, SiIver:
When you find it, prepare for squaIIs.
And if Jim Hawkins here is so much as scratched. . .
. . .there'II be a baII between your eyes that nobody wiII bother to remove.
SquaIIs, eh, matey?
Am I off my course and sitting on a waterspout?
I'd aImost wager.
East-southeast. . .
-. . .two points east.
-I thought so.
Just as the chart says.
Why, that's one of the six brave Iads that FIint kiIIed. . .
. . .and Iaid their bones right in a Iine with the treasure.
There's five more of them ahead between us and the doubIoons.
Forward.
Darby McGraw! Darby McGraw!
Hark, ye.
Darby McGraw!
Darby McGraw!
That's him, I teII you. I've heard FIint caIIing Darby a hundred times.
Fetch aft the rum!
-Them was his Iast words aboveboard.
-That fixes it. I'm done.
Where might I hear that voice afore?
Nobody but us on this isIand knows them words. That's FIint's spirit.
Nothing but fIesh and bIood can taIk.
I was never afeard of FIint aIive, and I ain't scared to face him dead.
Come on, if you're coming.
There it be, mates, right in the cIearing there.
At it, mates. AII together.
-Why, there's nothing there at aII.
-Nothing, Jim.
We've been out-saiIed.
Here, Jim. Take that and stand by for troubIe.
Two guineas.
That's your 700,000 pounds, is it?
Why don't you dig a IittIe deeper, Iads.
Maybe you'II find radishes and turnips.
It's onIy an oId crippIe and a boy.
Let's settIe it.
Let them have it.
That'II hoId them for good and aII,
Gray.
Dr. Livesey, where did you come from?
-How did you happen--?
-We thought we'd be usefuI, Jim.
Look, sir, there's no treasure at aII.
We've come aII this way and everybody's been kiIIed for nothing.
Upon my word, sir,
I don't understand it.
WeII, don't try, Jim.
We'II go up to Ben Gunn's cave.
Maybe oId Ben's got another trick in his beard.
Beard? Cave? Upon my word, sir.
Thank ye kindIy, doctor, and quite a squaII it were.
By the powers. That voice.
-So it be you, Ben Gunn.
-How do you do, Mr. SiIver?
''Pretty weII, I thank you,'' says you.
Ben, Ben. To think as you've done me.
Gray, Iead the way with Jim.
March, SiIver.
You'II find as how you've been done by everybody.
-Have you had enough action, me Iad?
-No, thank you.
Keep going, keep going.
Why, bIess my souI. . . .
But-- What's--?
Upon my souI, how did it aII get here?
AII found and carried up here with my own hands, says I.
''Very thoughtfuI,'' says you?
And you can be fuII of cheese from now on, says I.
''Yes,'' says you?
Yes, says I.
Be it aII here, Ben Gunn?
You don't be hoIding out any on us, now, be you?
Mr. SiIver, says I.
-SiIver.
-Aye, aye, sir.
WeII, captain, I reports back to duty.
Me and Jim pIayed a powerfuI trick on them.
Now that we aII have the treasure, why, we're aII one big, happy famiIy.
We've got the treasure. We.
You're going back to stand triaI in
EngIand for mutiny and murder, my man.
Look, Jim. Rubies with fire in them.
Them's pretty harsh measures.
Pretty strong medicine, captain, for just a IittIe infraction of the ruIes.
Not nearIy so harsh or strong. . .
. . .as the rope I hope to see you hanging from at Execution Dock.
You're under arrest, SiIver.
-Hispaniola ahoy!
-Ahoy! Ahoy!
Don't Ieave me!
Don't Ieave me, I'II stand triaI!
We'II starve. We'II starve!
You had your chance, my friends.
We'II pick up a new crew at Jamaica.
Did the frigate answer our signaI?
She says, ''Come aboard,
Hampton commanding. ''
Good. Ben Gunn, stay aIert, now.
-We want no strange craft aIongside.
-Aye, sir.
A British ship of the Iine.
And tomorrow we may have the pIeasure of seeing SiIver. . .
. . .hanging to a yardarm.
WeII, Jim, do you come to take oId John aIoft for a breather?
No. I fetched you this instead.
Thank ye, matey, but I ain't much for spirits.
WeII, I thought you might Iike to start and drink a Iot of it.
-Why?
-WeII, doesn't everybody?
I mean, before they're hanged?
Hanged, matey?
They went over to a frigate that's Iying here.
They're not gonna wait tiII we get to EngIand.
Captain says we can hoId a navaI triaI tomorrow. . .
. . .and the squire says we can see you swinging from a yardarm.
That ain't just exactIy a breather, be it, Jim?
I'm sorry. TruIy, I am.
You say they aII went over?
No, they Ieft Ben Gunn on watch.
WeII, Jim. . .
. . .I guess you'II have to stand on deck and watch me swing.
I can't bear the thought of it.
Of you, of anybody.
Oh, we won't think about that, Jim.
You just dies, and that's that.
Quite often, though, not as quick as peopIe think, Jim.
-Why not?
-WeII. . .
. . .you take my case, as it were.
Now, there I'II be, way out on that yardarm.
Way out there with a rope around my neck.
And then they gives the orders to jump.
And when the average man jumps and reaches the end of that rope. . .
. . .snaps his head around, way around Iike that.
That's the average man. But of course, with me, it's a IittIe bit different.
With my one Ieg, you see,
I'd be kind of off-baIance.
And if they didn't get that noose just right. . .
. . .right there, why, I'd probabIy just. . .
. . .sIowIy strangIe and choke. . .
. . .just so I didn't swaIIow my tongue.
But that very rareIy happens, Jim, swaIIowing the tongue.
Stop, stop!
There. I don't know how you'II get by Ben Gunn. . .
-. . .but you're free from here, at Ieast.
-Oh, that's my matey.
If ever the day comes that I can heIp you, why, I--
I'm going to. . . .
What's the matter?
I guess you'II have to heIp me up, matey.
It's my rheumatism.
This pIace is damp in here.
No, no, no. I'm tickIish under my arm.
Thank ye, matey, thank ye.
Where's Ben Gunn?
Sitting up by the mizzenmast on guard.
You run aft and get me a pistoI.
-No, there'II be no bIood spiIIed in this.
-Oh, no, not for Ben Gunn.
Why, I can taIk with Ben, he and me are oId shipmates.
Just for protection on shore, you know.
It's a wiId pIace, Jamaica.
AII right.
But I toId you, you mustn't.
Now, ain't that terribIe?
He's Ieft to guard a ship, and there he Iays in a drunken stupor.
But he has a awfuI Iarge bump on his head.
WeII, he must have got that when he feII off of there. . .
. . .and hit the deck with his head.
Ain't that too bad.
WeII, matey. . . .
What oId Long John's got to teII you, he don't know how to say it.
I don't mean that you'II be forgiving me aII the bad things that I've done. . .
. . .but just for the mateys that we might have been.
You won't be a pirate anymore, wiII you?
You won't steaI?
No, sir. From now on. . .
. . .my course is going to be a straight, honest one, so heIp me.
Why, shiver my timbers, I--
WeII, now, I'm gIad that happened, matey.
That's just what I was trying to teII you, and I didn't know how.
I cut through the buIkhead, into where the treasure was. . .
. . .and took off just one sack of goId.
But you promised you wouIdn't.
WeII, I took that before I promised.
But it's off my conscience now. . .
. . .and the Lord knows my conscience won't stand any more, matey.
-WeII, here. You may need it.
-No, no, no, thanks.
But you have to buy food.
No, that's aII right, Jim.
I'II get aIong aII right.
I'II get aIong aII right.
WeII, matey. . . .
Here.
Feed her good.
And put her. . . .
You put her down beIow decks when any women around, huh?
I wiII. I promise I wiII.
Oh, beIay that. Don't do that.
Our courses wiII cross again sometime.
Lookie. Lookie, now.
Now, you didn't get aII of that bar siIver on that isIand, now, did you?
-No.
-WeII, who knows?
Maybe someday you'II have a great big ship.
Bigger than this one.
And you'II go down there and get the rest of that treasure, now, won't you?
And you might be needing a mate or a captain, huh?
-I guess so.
-AII right.
And who do you think wouId come hobbIing aIong for that berth. . .
. . .but oId Long John SiIver?
It'd be Honest Long John then.
And together, we'd go down there and dig up that treasure. . .
. . .and we'd scour aII the seas for aII the treasures on those isIands.
And we'd hunt goats.
And fight cannibaIs.
It's true, matey. Certain, we wiII.
Certain, we wiII.

Where the blazing desert meets the blue Mediterranean and modern Europe jostles ancient Africa
I'm not interested in hearing excuses about local conditions.
No doubt there are local conditions.
Here's a criminal whose exploits have made him notorious throughout Europe.
He escaped from France with a fortune in jewels. And for two years, he's been living here in Algiers, within a stone's throw of your headquarters.
As you say commissioner.
I'm here to settle this.
I want it done quickly.
We've been trying to settle the case of Pepe le Moko for two years.
In Paris, we handle more difficult cases every day.
Too bad you couldn't arrest him before he escaped from France.
Merely an oversight, no doubt.
Do you deal in riddles here?
Indeed we do.
Oriental riddles.
From my experience, there's no problem in surrounding a given area.
You close in, and you make a house-to-house investigation.
A house-to-house investigation?
You just arrived from Paris, commissioner.
You're not familiar with the Casbah.
Casbah? What's that?
Some kind of nut?
A very hard nut to crack.
You see. Pepe le Moko lives in the Casbah.
Why not go in and take him out of it?
You can't arrest a king in his own palace.
Pepe is well guarded.
Let me show you.
Fantastic.
As a civilized man, you don't like fantasy.
As a police officer, I don't believe in it.
But here it is.
The native quarter known as the Casbah.
As you look at it here, it's just a few lines on the map.
But the reality is something stranger than anything you could have dreamed.
It's only a step from the modern city, the Casbah.
But when you take that step, you enter another world.
A melting pot for all the sins of the earth.
Seen from a bird's eye view, the Casbah is a great staircase.
Each step is a terrace rising from the sea.
If you observe more closely, you'll see that those terraces and courtyards and twisted streets are like a crawling anthill, a jungle of houses, a labyrinth of narrow passages and winding alleys rotten with vermin and decay from the filth of centuries.
No one knows what mysteries are hidden behind those walls.
No one knows what crimes and hopes are buried in those secret courtyards.
Forty thousand inhabitants from all over the world.
Some have been settled here for generations.
There are Kabulis in their white robes,
Chinese faithful to Confucius,
Gypsies with their fortune telling and their songs, and there are many Czechos, and there are Slavs far from home, and Maltese,
Negroes from every corner of Africa,
Sicilians and Spaniards, hot-blooded and quick to hate, and women, women of every age and every shape, women caught in the neck of the Casbah.
And everywhere there are terraces, all connected together so that those who are accepted can move to any part of the Casbah without using the street.
The terraces are the domain of the native women and it would be dire for a foreigner to go there unless he was known and protected.
The Casbah rises like a fortress from the sea, colorful, sordid, dangerous.
There isn't just one Casbah.
There are hundreds, a thousand.
And in that labyrinth,
Pepe le Moko is at home, and he's safe as long as he stays there.
You mean to say that you don't go into this quarter?
It's easy to go in.
Sometimes, it's no so easy to come out.
You cross the dead line.
Suddenly, a bullet hits you feet.
It's just a friendly suggestion.
Don't take the next step.
From a roof up above, a voice speaks.
Hello, inspector.
How did he know you were there?
Don't ask us.
Ask Inspector Slimane.
The Casbah is his territory.
How does Pepe le Moko conceal himself?
Disguise, no doubt.
You don't know Pepe.
He'd laugh at a disguise.
Then why don't you find him?
Oh, but that is singularly easy.
I see him every day.
What?
Our distinguished colleague is disturbed.
The man is wanted in all the capitals of Europe, and you see him every day.
Another example of what you call the local condition.
Gross inefficiency. No effort to make an arrest.
To arrest him in the Casbah, distinguished colleague, would be simple.
To get him out would be impossible.
So, you do nothing.
I flatter myself that I do a great deal in my humble way.
I learn about Pepe. I know his habits. I study his weaknesses.
When one can't use guns, one must work with brains.
I prefer guns.
In your case, honored sir, such a preference is unavoidable.
By his looks, I'd say he was too lazy to make an arrest.
I'm merely careful.
Which means to say you're looking after your own skin.
It's the only skin I have.
So Pepe le Moko wouldn't amuse me.
We'll find out.
I want twelve men tonight, inspected and ready for work.
And you might prepare a special cell for Pepe le Moko.
You and I have the same feeling, Pepe, for beauty.
This pearl belongs on a very special kind of ear, like a pink shell with a little curl of gold hair, a special kind of gold.
I can see it.
No.
Pearls don't suit you at all, Carlos.
You're not the type.
He'd look better with rings in his ears.
Yes, and one in his nose.
He is definitely uncouth.
You took the words out of my mouth.
He's trying to cheat us, Pepe.
All his talk is so he can get a better price, so he can make fools of us.
Yes.
So he's here to make a fool of me.
Why don't you try it some time?
Grandpere dealt with us for two years.
We must have confidence in each other.
That's the way to get along.
That's the truth, Pepe.
Well, why don't we get our money and be done with it?
He doesn't speak our language.
Pretend he is not here.
Yes, but I am here.
He doesn't know he's not here.
One more thing he doesn't know will make it practically a perfect score.
He was talking about beauty.
The more he talks about beauty, the less he talks about money.
And I'm talking about how much.
Oh, you make me sick.
What?
Say that again.
You make me sick.
Since you make him sick...
Ok.
Look, but don't touch.
You know, this was once my trade.
I began life in a jewelry store.
And when you left you took the store with you.
Yeah, it became a habit.
You know, I dream about sitting down in Paris sometime.
I'd make a collection of things like this.
Not just for myself, for people to see in glass cases.
With you in a uniform taking care of them together.
And you, Max.
Me?
You, Pierrot.
Oh, you'd have a uniform like a general, and you'd be in charge of everything.
What about me?
What would he be?
Stuffed in a glass case?
What?
Say that again.
Stuffed in a glass case.
Like an Egyptian mummy.
Ok.
Hey.
Police !
Police !
Police !
Police !
Ah !
You.
Where's Pepe le Moko?
(speaks in arabic "moi...
I don't know him")
Cuff him.
Uh, uh.
Where's Pepe le Moko?
I don't know.
By the sword of the Great Prophet, I haven't set eyes on him in two weeks.
He hasn't let me look on his face in two weeks.
Let him go.
Grandpere?
Who is he?
Receiver of stolen goods.
Do you know where his place is?
We know it.
Pepe?
No.
It's Regis.
What's the matter?
The police.
They're looking for Pepe.
So soon?
Soon? Were you expecting them?
Always.
But especially tonight. Pepe said they sent someone all the way from Paris.
So he knew?
Of course. Pepe knows everything.
You're. You're going to him?
Tell him I've never seen so many.
He'll laugh.
That's what he expected.
Look. Look at my neck.
I thought they were going to wring it like a chicken.
But all the time I thought only if Pepe kill me. I thought so long as Pepe.
Why should you feel that way about Pepe?
Don't you?
I?
Everyone knows how I feel about Pepe.
Pepe doesn't like me. He ignores me. Humiliates me.
But I have my revenge. Sometime he'll be sorry he didn't notice me sooner.
Oh, I'm very humble.
I do my best to serve him in my own way.
That's nice of you, Regis.
That's how I am.
Sensitive. But no one appreciates me.
Promise me you'll tell him that I came to warn you.
I will.
I don't want any favors.
I only want him to know that where there's trouble, look for Regis.
Third door on the left.
Take three men. Cover the roof.
You men go 'round the back.
It's Ines. Quick.
The police on the roof, Pepe. They're coming.
They surrounded the house. They know you're here.
That's funny.
How did they know I was here?
Oh, one can't meditate in peace anymore. Always rush and bustle.
I'll take this one.
I rather like it.
You think that's a toy?
No.
When will you learn to obey orders?
See.
Don't take so many chances.
That's foolish.
I don't want a bullet to come between us, the way that one almost did.
Break it down.
Every few weeks, I have to get new doors.
Ines.
Did you tell anyone where I was?
No one, Pepe.
Are you sure?
Try to remember.
Why don't you believe me, Pepe?
All I want is to please you.
I couldn't lie to you.
Couldn't you?
What about all that time you kept telling me that you didn't like me?
But this is serious.
Ah, so, love is not serious?
Pepe, it's serious if someone told the police.
I didn't talk to anyone. I stayed at home until Regis came.
Who came?
Regis.
Ahhh.
As soon as he told me, I ran to you.
What did Regis tell you?
Oh, about the police.
He wanted me to warn you.
It was nice of him.
That's what I thought.
Was that all you thought?
Wsa there anything else for me to think?
That's what I like about you.
What?
Nevermind.
This seems to be all.
All for me.
Search the place.
Hold out your hand.
Don't grab.
It's unlucky.
You want to give it to me, Pepe?
No.
It's for some fat, old woman.
Let me have it, Pepe. Some time, I'll get fat.
You'll lose it before that.
I'll keep it for a charm.
Then you must keep your fingers crossed.
Alright.
So.
This ring will mean that I'm always yours, Pepe, with my fingers crossed.
Those baboons are turning my house upside down.
They'll be here next.
Let's get out.
No, you stay here.
When the police come, you know what to say.
No evidence?
Nothing.
Are you satisfied?
I'm never satisfied.
Take your men back to the roof.
The rest of you follow me.
There they go.
This way quickly.
Come in.
Make yourself comfortable.
What is this? What happened?
Oh, it's nothing.
You call this nothing?
Oh, you know how the police are.
They like to keep everything in an uproar.
A very profound observation.
The police have been trying to catch him for two years.
Police must be rather stupid.
As one of them, I consider that a triumph of understatement.
You're one of them?
I have that doubtful honor.
How does he do it?
Mademoiselle.
It's not his head that saves him. It's his heart.
A man with such a good heart could get around anywhere.
Sounds intriguing.
It's a matter of taste.
Oh, inspector.
Fix it up.
Permit me to hope that it's nothing serious.
Thanks.
A flea bite.
Why aren't you chasing the fox?
Oh, such a silly business.
I prefer to use my brains.
Well, your friends did a little better than usual tonight.
At least they found me. That's pretty good for them.
Shall we say a step in the right direction?
Excuse us madam if we talk shop.
Cigarette?
Please.
Let me help you.
So.
They surrounded the house?
Yes.
They thought I was at Grandpere's.
Poor old man.
He has no luck.
They won't even let him sleep in peace.
Sometimes, I feel sorry for them.
They'll never get me by this technique, you know.
I've tried to point that out to them.
For once we agree, the inspector and I.
I am the one who will get you Pepe, in the end.
I can hardly wait for the day.
And not only you, but the others,
Pierrot, Carlos, Grandpere, all of you.
And then what will you do?
Put us in the zoo?
You flatter yourself.
Oh, you mean you won't show me in a cage?
You're important now because you're free.
Once you're behind bars, people will forget all about you.
He is funny, my friend Slimane.
He looks normal, doesn't he?
But he has delusions of grandeur. He thinks he can arrest me.
That's exactly what I'm going to do Pepe.
Sure.
Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure.
How you make me laugh.
Do you know what I like about you?
No, but I'm humbly waiting for you to tell me.
Your face.
It's a perfect face for your job.
To look that false is almost the equivalent of being honest.
I'm honored that my appearance pleases you.
Don't mention it.
You'll excuse me?
I'm afraid I have to go.
Business.
Goodnight, Pepe.
It's a shame, isn't it?
What?
A waste of talent.
An unusual intelligence.
One hates to see him buried so young.
Buried?
It's the same thing.
What makes you so sure?
I've marked the date of his arrest on the wall of my room.
High.
Where it reads black in the rays of the setting sun.
Shall we go?
And although we narrowly missed capturing Pepe le Moko, he was evidently wounded while escaping.
In fact, his injuries may prove fatal.
In the event of his death, I shall inform you without delay.
Why don't you just declare him dead and be done with it?
You may rest assured that I have the situation well in hand and will take whatever steps I deem advisable.
Wire that to Paris immediately.
What does he mean by saying he has the situation well in hand?
He means he's going to sit here and write letters to Paris, while he waits for Pepe to die of old age.
That's better than going into the Casbah looking for him.
At least our friend from Paris has learned something about the Casbah.
We've all learned that there's only one way to arrest Pepe.
Oh, that's very intelligent of you.
As you know, my intelligence is at your service.
Well so far, it's hardly been enough.
Ah, but wait.
Suppose Pepe comes out of the Casbah.
Then it follows, his arrest is a matter of child's play.
Shall we send him an engraved invitation?
Pepe is too clever to fall into a trap, but some of his friends are not so clever.
Get to the point.
Suppose Pierrot comes down into the town,
Pepe would be worried about his absence, and he'll come down into the town to find him.
You've overlooked just one little point. How do you get Pierrot to come down?
Ah, that's my plan.
Magnificent plan.
I have here a letter.
I got it from Pierrot.
But he doesn't know that.
The letter is from his mother.
A letter of exquisite tenderness.
From France.
Can't see much value in that.
He's a bad boy but a good son.
So it isn't the good son that we'll lock up, but the bad boy.
Then, we keep the arrest a secret and Pepe will come down out of the Casbah to look for Pierrot.
Are we agreed?
Agreed.
And... as to the price?
You know the reward has been posted.
But a little bonus besides in view of the circumstances?
Agreed.
How do we know we can trust you not to make a better bargain with Pepe?
I'm an informer not a hypocrite.
What are you laughing at?
It amuses me to see you sell your friend at bargain prices.
You have a flair for business, Regis.
He says that because he's jealous. It doesn't upset me.
I ignore him.
Double him, dear. He'll never make it.
Good morning, Tanya.
Good morning, Inspector.
And how is Carlos?
How would he be?
Don't tell me your charming husband has been beating you again.
You know how it is with a man.
Well, I can't say I do.
Thay seem to take to it naturally.
Morning, pretty.
Good morning, Pepe.
Good morning, Pepe.
Hello.
Good morning, Pepe.
Good morning.
You better watch out, Pepe.
Women will be the death of you.
It's a happy death.
I'm just warning you.
Don't worry. I'll keep my head.
I may need it one of these days.
No doubt.
Coming my way?
With pleasure.
Good morning, Pepe.
Morning.
Good morning, Pepe.
Morning.
Did you get home safely last night?
Why not?
Morning, Pepe.
Morning.
Nothing unpleasant?
Yes, we had one rather unpleasant experience.
Yeah?
With you.
She didn't think so.
What makes you so sure?
What is she saying?
Well, you know women. They talk about nothing. I hardly listen.
Was there anything special about her?
Yes.
Pearls.
The corner I like.
Handcuffs I can appreciate.
Platinum and diamonds.
And she didn't buy that perfume in Algiers.
So all you noticed were the jewels and perfume.
Was there anything else?
What about the eyes?
They all have eyes, but all that shi shi and jingle, you don't see much of that in the Casbah.
But you do where she comes from.
Thank you.
She asked quite a few questions about you.
Yeah? What did you tell her?
What could I tell her?
Why? Did you think she might be afraid of my past?
No, but she might be a little appalled at your future.
I told her you might get off in 20 years with a good lawyer.
You wouldn't want me to get 20 years. You're too fond of me. What's her name?
So, you're thinking about her.
How could I be thinking about her when I don't know her name?
-Good morning, Pepe.
-Hello, Aicha.
Pierrot at home?
No, he's at Shinee's.
Let's go to Shinee.
What do you want?
I have a letter for Pierrot.
Give it to me.
Oh, no no no. I can't.
I swore by the ghosts of my ancestors to give it only to Pierrot.
Whose the letter from?
A woman.
What kind of a woman?
I didn't look.
Well, you tell the woman I took it away from you.
This vulgar game is hardly worth the compromise to ones dignity involved in playing it.
It's vulgar, but it's fast.
I don't know why I waste my time in such common pursuits with such mediocre companions.
My youth?
I intended to become a statesman.
Or?
Philosopher.
But a man's destiny is written in the stars.
We play the game.
But Fate controls the cards.
Who?
Fate.
If Fate goes on controlling the cards, he might find a knife between his ribs.
The moving finger writes.
Ans having writ moves on.
Stop that nonsense.
He has an ear but not for poetry.
I'm trying to think.
I would have played the ace.
Do you smell something?
I've been wondering.
Onions.
Cheese.
A mixture of cheese and onions.
I don't like it.
Would it be to much to ask you to take your nose out of my hand?
But you haven't got a hand.
Don't blow down my back.
You seem nervous.
My dear fellow, consider yourself blackballed by this club.
He means get out.
Oh.
What are you hanging around for? This is business.
Read this.
Bad news?
Pierrot.
Wait for me.
I would like it better if you didn't hang around so much with Regis.
Why?
Did you ever see a clock that pointed to two and struck four when it is really quarter past twelve?
Well, you will find Regis is like that.
He doesn't ring two.
That's what you say, but you can't prove it.
Well.
If I say so, that's enough.
Regis gets along alright with me.
That's why I'm telling you. I don't like it.
Well I do.
In business, I'll do anything you say, Pepe.
But outside business I'll do as I please.
Oh, so.
You'll do as you please?
It's a good thing I like you.
Now get out.
Nice kid.
What did she write you in her last letter?
She had a cold. She said she'd start as soon as she felt better.
Ah, then you knew she was coming.
I sent her a money order.
In that case, it isn't so strange.
And yet it's odd that she should arrive in Algiers like that without letting you know,
That's what I thought.
Ah.
Is this her handwriting?
Have you another letter?
Yes, I think so.
Good. We'll put them both together like a pair of Siamese twins.
Then we'll see if they're both from the same mama.
Well, what do you think?
Same mistakes in spelling.
Our poor dear mamas can never spell.
Same 'n'.
Same what?
Same 'n'.
And the crossing of the 't'.
Well, that settles it. You can always tell by the crossing of the 't'.
Then, you think it's alright?
Well, you can see with your own eyes.
Then, I don;t want her to be there worrying.
-After all, she's 62.
-Oh, my mother lived to 84.
She never felt better than the day she died.
Where's that?
If I know it well, half hour's walk.
I can take you there if you wish to go.
I've got to go. I've got to see her.
Fortunately, you can rely on me.
It's good of you to help me, Regis.
You're a real friend.
Well, that's how I am. Sensitive.
You ready, Gaby?
Andre just phoned. They're waiting on the terrace.
If I sat for five minutes, Andre phones.
Well, don't you like having him so attentive?
Love it.
I've just been sitting here, thinking that I'm the happiest girl in the world.
Well, you ought to be.
Marrying a man who adores you and can give you everything in the world you ever dreamed about.
That's my trouble.
I'm such a fool.
I go dreaming about the wrong things.
Well, that's a terrible mistake.
Marie, remember the time in the Baltoin Bargain Basement.
The two of behind a counter. Handkerchiefs. Gloves.
Hosiery.
And don't you forget it.
I won't.
After all, you don't marry for fun.
I didn't.
Hello, Inspector.
So you've already met.
I took the liberty of presenting myself.
As you see, I couldn't wait to take advantage of your invitation last night.
I'm glad.
Yes, we're all glad.
Inspector, will you tell my fiance where I was last night during the shooting?
But with me.
There you see?
And who did we meet?
Pepe le Moko.
Nice friends you have.
In prisoners, one can't choose.
You don't mean Pepe le Moko, the famous criminal?
The one they're all talking about?
He'd like to hear you say that.
Just a common law-breaker.
Have you seen him since?
This morning.
Did he say anything bout me?
Well, in a way.
Oh, I know.
My pearls.
A connoisseur can admire pearls without neglecting the wearer.
Oh, he means if he stole your pearls, he'd steal you with them.
Does that frighten you, Gaby?
Oh, it sounds marvelous to me.
I'd like to meet him.
It could easily be arranged if you wish to visit the Casbah again with a suitable guide.
How's that, Andre? An adventure.
Well, that's what we're here for.
Once is enough for me. I don't like natives.
Then, we'll go with Maxim. You'll protect us. Won't you, Maxim?
I'm at my best among natives.
Tonight, Inspector? If it's convenient.
Uh huh.
Pepe.
Yes.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
What are you looking at like that?
France.
You can't see France.
Well, there is no harm in trying.
Pepe, what are you looking at like that?
A ship.
Doesn't it make you seasick to look at boats?
Doesn't it give you a headache to ask so many questions?
No.
Why? Have you got a headache?
No. I'm thinking.
Well, that's sure to give you a headache.
I don't think with my head but with my heart.
Then, you'd better tell me.
It's nothing.
If it's nothing, you'd better tell me.
Oh, I'll get mad if you go on like this.
I want you to get mad.
Shout at me and hurt me, but don't treat me as if I'm not here.
Oh, I know you're here.
No you don't.
You're dreaming about something with your eyes wide open.
I wish you'd dream about me.
Look.
You've always lived in the Casbah.
For you, there is nothing outside.
The Casbah is big enough.
Not for me.
It's like being in a grave.
Pepe.
Can't stand much more of it.
If you want to go away, I'll go with you.
Thanks.
Won't you take me?
I wish I could.
Paris is a long way off.
I don't care.
It's different there.
Couldn't you be happy with me in Paris?
You think I'd look funny in Paris.
Answer me.
Oh, but it isn't you, Ines.
It's the Casbah.
You belong here.
You don't understand the way I feel.
I've stood it for two years.
The time comes when you can't stand anymore.
Morning, noon, and night.
The same things. The same people.
I'm fed up.
I've had enough.
You're tired of me.
It has nothing to do with you.
I want to get away.
That has nothing to do with me?
Do you know when you're going away? Never.
You'll see.
You can't do it.
Never.
I am the Casbah. I'll keep you.
Just try to get away and you will find out.
It's funny for the police to come in and try to arrest you.
You're in prison already. You're in the Casbah with the wall around you.
Stop it.
There's nothing else. You'll never have anything else.
Stop it I tell you.
I am glad. There is no France for you. No Paris. No boulevards.
Are you through?
No.
Who is it?
Pierrot?
It's me, Aicha
Pepe.
I don't know what to do.
Pierrot.
I can't find him.
Did you go to Shinee's?
Yes.
And I Mother Teche's and the Ali Baba and the Algerians.
Everywhere.
-He ought to be back by now.
-Back?
Why did he go into town?
To see his mother.
What do you mean to see his mother?
He got a letter from her.
L'Arbi brought it.
Then, he went down with Regis.
And then Regis came back, but Pierrot
I'm still waiting for him, that's all.
Where's Regis?
At the Algerians.
No need to go down.
See you later.
Hello, Regis.
What's your hurry?
Oh, I'm in no hurry.
Good. Then, come along with me.
I'm waiting for Pierrot. We can wait for him together.
But listen, Pepe. I've got to go down.
What's the matter? What makes you so nervous?
Me? Nervous?
Why should I be nervous?
That's just it. Why?
Well. It's only that usually you hardly say hello to me and when you do so I don't expect it when you don't.
I'm a little surprised when you do because you don't usually.
Well, you see. I haven't appreciated you at your real value.
That's the trouble.
So, I made a mistake.
Shall we go?
Where?
Oh, any quiet corner where we can talk.
I've been hearing great stories about your courage.
My courage?
You're surprised?
No.
I even hear you proved it.
Me?
Yes, you.
Well, it's possible. One can be brave without knowing it.
Of course.
How? How did I prove it?
Why by going down into town with Pierrot.
Ah, not everybody would have done that.
Oh, yes.
And after that you came back here.
That was a brave thing to do.
Yes. Wasn't it?
Now you see why I have completely changed my ideas about you.
You're right.
I was helping the boy out. Nothing more.
Of course.
Tell me.
Where did you leave Pierrot?
Somewhere. I don't quite remember.
That's it.
You don't mind if I refresh your memory, do you?
He went to see his poor old mother.
How is she?
I didn't see her.
Why not?
She was in bed sick. He didn't want to disturb her.
It must have been an awful shock for Pierrot.
He thought she was in France.
I think he got a letter.
Did you see it?
Just a glimpse.
So you left him?
And you came back alone.
He wanted to stay with her.
That's natural.
Yes, very natural.
Exactly.
Of course.
Want me?
No, we're just talking.
Sit down.
Regis did a fine thing today.
He went down into town with Pierrot.
Fine.
And now you're waiting for poor Pierrot.
Why poor Pierrot?
Because he went down with Regis.
What of it?
Nothing.
Maybe I should say and now you're waiting for Pierrot with poor Regis.
What's the matter? Huh?
I've gotta have air.
Just relax.
Take it easy.
We understand how anxious you are about Pierrot. Here.
Take this.
Go ahead. Drink.
Don't take a bite out of it.
I don't know what's the matter with me.
You'll get over it.
In an hour, you'll feel much better.
Let me go.
Let me go.
With a fever like that?
You musn't think of exerting yourself.
Cigarette?
Don't make such a fuss.
Go on and smoke.
It'll settle your nerves.
Say, Pepe.
His hair is getting a little long here on his neck.
Don't you think we ought to cut it for him?
You were fond of Pierrot, weren't you?
Oh, I was. I am fond of him.
Well, then.
You don't want to leave before he gets back.
You want to know why he has been detained.
-Don't you?
-Yes yes yes.
Must be the fever.
I'm worried about you.
He's burning up.
I'm afraid he'll sizzle before too long.
I don't know anything about Pierrot.
Pepe. Pepe. Let me go. You know me; you know I'm alright.
Tell me you do. Last night, I was the one who came to warn you.
Yes, you were the one.
Let me go.
He's delirious.
This is terrible.
He may not last the next round.
How about a little game to calm him down?
Alright.
It is really alarming.
If I may say so, he is not at his best.
He must stay right where he is.
We can't be too careful.
What are you doing?
Ines.
Try to find him, and bring him back. Quick.
He went down with Regis.
If you bring him back,
Regis may recover.
Alright.
Cut 'em, Regis.
The black spot.
Oh, that's bad.
Suppose you can't find him.
Don't worry.
This way.
The women look so mysterious.
No doubt they'd say the same about you.
Trump?
But you've got a heart.
What's the matter with me? I'm not myself.
What kind of a game is this?
Concentrate.
He's thinking of Pierrot.
Yes, of course.
Worry about a friend can cause unutterable anguish to a sensitive nature.
Do you mean it makes him sweat?
A certain exudation hyper-actuated by an emotional stimulation.
You don't mean him?
Deal me out.
Take care of Regis.
Never go back on a friend when he is in trouble.
Still waiting, little one?
You know what this reminds me of? A little place in New York on 42nd street.
That's the thing about travelling.
There's always something different.
One time, I was in Corsica and I thought I was in Turkey.
Remember the time we were on the Nile and I thought it was Venice?
Tell me. Do they have native music here?
On the phonograph.
Oh. Well.
What's that one?
Never heard of it.
Must be native music.
So you wanted to take another look at this strange, wild animal.
Strange but not so very wild.
How do you like my cage?
I don't know. Yet.
Do you like Algiers.
I don't like travelling; makes me homesick.
Does it?
I can't see Paris when I open my eyes in the morning.
I want to go right back to sleep.
Do you know Paris?
Do I know Paris?
Now is summertime.
Champs-脡lys茅es.
La Gare du Nord.
The Op茅ra, Boulevard des Capucines
La Chapelle
Rue Montmartre
Boulevard de Rochechouart
Rue Fontaine
La Place Blanche.
What a small world.
Cigarette?
Thanks.
Got a light?
We are a long way from home.
Excuse me.
Well?
He still thinks he's playing his last card.
Not bad.
I'll tell her you said so.
No no no. I mean the rock she's wearing.
Now if it was me, I'd get them first and then do the fancy stuff afterward.
Shut up
You can't talk to me like that.
You heard me. Shut up.
Okay.
He was talking about me.
He was worried about you.
About me?
All that stuff you're holding.
That's nice of him.
You're not worried yourself?
No.
Not while I'm with you.
Right.
This is something.
Isn't it? And it hardly weighs anything.
At least
20,000 francs.
Add a zero.
I mean what I would get for it.
Here.
Put it on again.
You put it on.
Want to dance?
Yes.
What's your name?
Gabrielle.
They call me Gabby.
Married?
No.
Widowed?
No.
Why not?
Who are you with?
My fiance.
What is he like?
Generous.
Stuck being at the hotel?
I let him.
What are you laughing at?
It's nothing.
-Too bad.
-Too bad?
Too bad I don't know you better.
Why?
Because I will slap your face.
When people laugh around me, I like to know why.
This all reminds me of when I was a kid.
We used to dance in the streets on holidays, New Years, first of May.
14th of July.
Why do you know?
What do you think I was doing?
Too bad you weren't in my
 neighbourhood, Rue de la Bruy猫re
Rue de la Bruy猫re?
That's where I lived.
I went to school on the hill.
That was almost next door to me.
No.
Let's go out.
Where to?
To the terrace.
Can you see the harbor?
You can see Montmartre.
And Les Champs-脡lys茅es.
And Place Blanche.
I love Place Blanche.
Oh, I can't.
I can't leave my friends.
But I'll come back.
When?
As soon as I can.
When?
Tomorrow.
How can I be sure?
I never break a promise.
Let me go.
Why should I?
'Cause I ask you.
Say please.
You're rude.
Am I?
I'll be expecting you.
Here.
It would be nice if we could meet at Place Blanche.
Well, what about Pierrot?
I don't know.
Didn't you go down to find him?
I didn't want to leave you alone.
I'm not alone. I'm with madame.
Do as I told you.
Pierrot.
Where is he?
Who?
Regis. Where is he?
Come on.
They got me, Pepe.
The police.
I didn't listen to you.
I'll help you.
No. No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
Oh, no.
Pierrot?
There's no sense to it.
That's what they said.
They?
Those people.
They were frightened.
Said they'd never come back.
I was fond of Pierrot.
I regarded him almost as a son.
Well, he's closed his umbrella.
Pepe, there's no use in thinking about Pierrot.
Don't you tell me what to think.
This a sad thing.
Are you finished?
I beg your pardon.
You were fond of him. That's enough.
Can't a man talk?
Well?
Well.
It's finished.
I did everything you would have done, Pepe.
I was all alone at the cemetery.
I followed the custom of your people.
A handful of earth on the body.
And flowers to make him feel at home in such a strange place.
It's hard not to be able to go sown to say goodbye to your friend on his last journey.
I'm your friend, Pepe.
I lnow how you feel; you'er a prisoner in the Casbah.
But the day will come when they won't be able to prevent your leaving.
You'll go out of the Casbah in spite of them all.
I'll get out whenever I wish.
When you go, you'll go quietly the way Pierrot went.
Feet first.
Be patient.
When the time comes, they'll take off their hats and let you pass.
I'll go out alive.
I don't think you're as foolish as that.
Grandperre,
I've heard enough.
Music. Singing. Gibberish.
I'm sorry for you.
How is she?
She?
You know.
I'm afraid you won't see her again. The last visit was a little too much for her.
She got a bad impression of the Casbah.
It's a pity.
Why should it be a pity?
For your sake since it seems to mean so much to you.
To me?
So that's what you're so sorry about.
Why are you standing there staring at me?
Do as I tell you.
Go down.
And you too.
Get out.
I've had enough.
And you.
I'm sick of looking at you.
You seem to be sick of everything.
Right.
I'd bring her up to see you again if it were possible, but there's no chance.
So.
She's not coming back.
That's fine.
What?
All that swell jewelry, you had it right in the palm of your hand.
That's enough.
These people who look as if they can tear down everything and when a woman looks at them, they get as soft as butter.
Get out.
Well, I'm not made of butter. Not me.
Get out.
Ok.
Your friends have no tact, my dear Pepe.
They have no respect for the beauty of your anguish.
I know how it pains you to live among this cattle.
Let me assure you.
They can't keep me here.
I'm free.
Free to go.
I'm sick of it.
All of you.
I'm sick of listening to you.
And I'm sick of looking at you.
I'll get out when I feel like it.
None of you can stop me.
Listen to me, Pepe.
I don't need your advice.
None of you.
I'm free to do as I please.
Free. You hear that?
You're walking into a trap.
You know better.
They can't touch me. I'm going down. Get out of the way.
Let me. And when I please is now. Get out of my way.
He's gone mad. He's going down to the town.
He won't listen.
Hello.
Good.
I'll attend to it.
Inspector Slimane.
He says Pepe le Moko is coming out.
Pepe.
Pepe, don't go.
You're mad.
Pepe, don't go. Please don't go.
I didn't want to tell you this, but she's up there now at your old house waiting for you.
Where is she?
Where is she?
You lied to me, didn't you?
Answer me. Didn't you?
It was the only way I could keep you from going.
If I had asked you not to go for me, you wouldn't have listened to me.
So.
You ought to be fed up with a fellow like me.
I didn't know I could make such a fool of myself.
Ines, have something better than this.
It's not what you deserve.
It's what you want.
Why do you worry about me?
It's not good.
I have a sharp that brings me luck.
You brought us both luck this time.
All the while I went running,
I kept my hand so.
But you caught me.
I didn't know you could run so fast.
Don't forget; I've had practice.
But nobody ever caught me before.
Next time, give me a head start.
Next time?
Don't worry.
Not 'til I catch my breath.
I'm thirsty.
I'll get it.
No you won't.
Here I am.
I said I'd be here.
Well?
You look as though you've seen a ghost.
You're beautiful.
That's easy to say.
I know a lot of people have told you.
But what I'm telling you is different. See?
For me, you're more than that.
For two years, I've been lost.
Like walking in my sleep.
Slowly I wake up. That's you.
I don't know what I've been doing all that time, waiting for you without knowing it.
Do you know what you are to me?
Paris. That's you.
Paris.
With you, I escape.
Follow me?
The whole town is spring morning in Paris.
You're lovely.
You're marvelous.
And do you know what you remind me of?
The subway.
Close your eyes.
Listen.
Can you hear it?
That's my heart beating.
Dose it go like a subway train?
Faster.
You're all silk, and you jingle when you walk.
And with all that shi shi, you make me think of the subway.
Isn't that funny?
And potato chips and coffee on the boulevard.
What did you do before?
Before what?
Before the jewels.
I wanted them.
It's late.
I must go.
Suppose you don't come tomorrow.
Suppose I don't.
Can't you ever get away from the Casbah?
Why do you ask?
Can't you?
No.
I'm caught here like a bear in a hole, dogs barking, hunters all around, no way out of it.
Do you like that?
Maybe it's lucky for you.
I don't like it.
And it's not lucky.
You're right.
If you don't come back, I might do anything.
I might go down to the hotel to get you.
Tomorrow, Pepe.
Tomorrow?
I never break a promise.
You smell good.
The subway?
Streamlined.
Hey.
Anton.
Tomorrow.
5 o'clock.
Did you get them?
What?
The hardware.
What's the matter with you?
If you didn't get the jewels, you're simply wasting your time.
What were you doing in there?
Where?
There.
You're mistaken.
We were not there.
Say that again.
We were in Paris.
What?
Okay.
Life is simple if you try to enjoy before you die every bit of happiness along the way.
Take the joy that comes to you.
Suddenly the world is too with the song that keeps you dancing every day.
That's the life.
Fall in love and life is sunny.
That's the life you don't need money if you've got a little honey in your arms.
That's the life.
I'm in heaven and I know it.
Can I help it if I show it?
Life is sweet as can be for me.
Love is very necessary.
Fall in love and you'll be happy. That's the life.
You don't know just what you miss if you live without a kiss for a kiss can bring your winter into spring.
Everybody will agree. If you fall in love like me, you'll be happy, you will laugh, and you will sing.
That's the life.
That's the life we should be living.
Kiss morning, noon, and evening. That's the life that I'll be living.
That's the moon. That's the life.
There is nothing like that feeling.
Tell me what is more appealing than the feeling you're in love for sure.
Love is very necessary. Fall in love and you'll be happy. That's the life.
Love is very necessary.
Fall in love and you'll be happy. That's the life.
Pepe, what's happened?
Don't you know?
It's a holiday.
No, I didn't know what day it is.
It's Sunday. Everyone gets a holiday.
But it's not Sunday.
If I say so, it's Sunday.
It's Thursday.
That's the trouble with you; you always think it's Thursday.
I didn't think so yesterday.
Just as a favor to me, let it be Sunday.
I want to stroll on the boulevard.
I have a date at the Place Blanche.
Hello, everybody.
How do you like my singing?
What's the good of it?
You ought to appreciate the finer things of life.
Who? Him?
When you feel like that, sing.
It quiets the nerves.
You seem pleased. You've seen her again.
Wouldn't you like to know.
Oh, well. If you don't want to confide in me.
Well, our inspector got himself a haircut.
Did she come back?
A regular Romeo.
You ought to get a permanent wave.
You're expecting her again today?
The trouble with you, Inspector, is that you do too much inspecting.
Now, not a word about what I have told you.
Just between ourselves, yup.
Inspector.
Good afternoon.
I was puzzled when you phoned.
My mission is a rather delicate one but necessary.
I merely wish to suggest that your fiance is a little too fond of shall we say, the local color of the Casbah.
What is all this?
The Casbah is hardly the place for a woman alone.
She attracts too much attention, excites too much desire.
If we, naturally, wish to protect her from any embarrassment.
Further embarrassment can very easily be avoided.
She must not return to the Casbah.
Come in.
Sorry to disturb you.
You're going out?
Looks that way.
Where are you going?
A walk.
But where?
In the Champs-脡lys茅es.
May I ask you to give me a sensible answer?
Then ask me a sensible question. Where could I go?
I don't know anyone in Algiers.
I just walk straight ahead.
Straight ahead?
And where does that take you?
I'll know when I get there.
No you won't because you're not going.
Oh, yes, my dear.
Your hotel bores me.
The head waiter looks like an undertaker.
An every time I step into this apartment it looks more like a funeral parlor.
Goodbye, darling.
I know where you're going.
Ah?
You're going to the Casbah.
So?
You go there every day.
Do I?
To meet Pepe le Moko.
So now you're spying on me?
You're going to be my wife.
You don't make it a very pleasant prospect.
And I won't allow you to behave like this.
I'm glad you told me.
What do you mean?
We've got to be honest.
Why do you think I'm marrying you?
Look at yourself, and now look at me.
I've never lied to you.
You knew I didn't love you when I promised to marry you, and you though it was alright.
Until we are married, I'll do as I please.
That's fair enough.
I forbid you to go.
It's a waste of time.
If you go now, there'll be no use in you coming back.
You've thought it all out pretty clearly. Haven't you?
And I advise you to do the same.
Alright.
Goodbye.
Do it, Gaby. Don't.
No.
What?
You can't go to the Casbah.
But really.
Your fiance was trying to spare you.
He didn't want to tell you the truth as I told it to him.
An attempt was made to capture Pepe le Moko this afternoon.
The attempt was successful.
He was taken?
Not alive.
He was killed.
I just came to tell you, it's Thursday.
I know.
I was right all the time.
You see, I'm not just a fool as you think.
So this is the Place Blanche.
It's not much fun on Thursday, is it?
It doesn't seem like Paris.
What's got into him?
Weren't you ever disappointed in love?
Yes. Badly.
I'll try to please you.
I'm like Pepe.
I like 'em with diamonds.
Now he's missed his chance.
So I guess I'll have to go downtown and give my personal attention to madam's hardware.
What steamer?
The Ville d'Algers? Ten o'clock? Good.
Make the reservation.
Are you leaving?
I suppose you won't stay for the funeral.
Four. First class.
Oh. Send up some whiskey and soda.
You'll have a drink.
Just a short one.
Make you feel better.
Anything wrong?
Why don't you sing?
Why don't you mind your own business?
I am.
Only I just though you might be interested.
I'm going downtown.
What for?
Unlike you, I'm bored.
Anything in your mind?
Just to look things over.
-When are you going?
-Now. No use to see a lawyer about it.
-Do me a favor.
-Sure.
I want you to deliver a letter.
I'd take anything that isn't loaded.
Ok. I get the idea.
Maybe I don't look like Cupid, but I'll manage.
Pen and paper.
Go to the servants' entrance.
Give someone a good tip.
And tell them you've got to have an answer.
Don't worry. I won't come back empty handed.
I'll wait for you at your house.
I'll be back in two hours. Tell Tania.
Good luck.
What time is it?
9 o'clock.
Is that all?
In the morning.
Sun is out.
I slept all that time?
Carlos?
He hasn't come back.
He hasn't come back?
I sat up all night.
I'd like to see him back with what I've got to tell him.
This time, I'll make him listen to me.
Poor Carlos.
Same old story.
Well.
Life is like that.
Yeah.
And we're dumb enough to hang on because we don't want to stir it when.
Smart.
Is Pepe here?
What do you want?
We've been looking for you everywhere. Why weren't you at home?
Because I'm here.
What do you want, L'Arbi?
I must speak to you alone.
What's the matter with us?
Ever got small pox?
-It's alright; you can talk.
-Pepe, I'm ashamed of myself.
What's new about that?
-Oh, It's more than you think.
-I doubt that.
Go ahead and insult me.
I deserve it.
You flatter yourself.
It's about the letter from Pierrot's mother.
I brought it and gave it to Aicha, but I didn't know it was from the police.
If I had known the letter was written by Regis, I wouldn't have done it. Never.
Go on.
It was really a woman who gave me the letter.
I, if I had known the truth, I wouldn't have touched it.
I'm an informer.
Yes, but I wouldn't have done a thing like that.
Oh, you're only half an informer.
The other half is alright.
Oh, that's why I'm here.
For what?
I couldn't stand it any longer. Forgive me, Pepe.
Alright. Stop grovelling; it makes me sick.
I want you to have a good opinion of me.
So?
I want you to believe me.
That's why I'm here, to tell you they got Carlos.
What about Carlos?
The police took him.
-How much did you sell him for?
-I wouldn't be here if I'd sold him.
First Pierrot, then Carlos.
Bad luck always runs in threes.
Your turn will be next, Pepe.
Don't be so sure.
So they arrested him.
Who did it?
Inspector Louvain.
They were about a dozen of them surrounding him.
Was there any shooting?
No, no. They managed very quietly in a nice way.
What did you have to do with it?
I was at the police station when they brought Carlos in.
I had the chance to see him in his cell.
They gave me a letter, the one you had given him.
Told me to take it to the hotel.
Every time there is a letter, he is the one that brings it.
It looks funny to me.
Be quiet.
Oh, I am to be quiet while you write letters to other women?
Never mind that.
You never wrote a letter to me.
Shut up.
So you went to the hotel with the letter.
I did it for you, Pepe.
You get it?
What?
The answer.
Oh, she wouldn't write you.
But she couldn't.
She's being closely watched.
But she expects you this morning.
You can go down without any risk.
Go to her.
Service entrance in the back of the hotel.
She'll be watching from her window.
Is that all?
She wants to come out, but she couldn't get away.
-You're not going out, Pepe. You can't.
-I told you to shut up.
Go on.
She's waiting for me to bring the answer.
What shall I tell her?
She's waiting for it.
Yes.
I'll take the answer myself.
You wait here.
But Pepe.
Don't worry.
My friends will take good care of you until I come back.
But she expects me.
What?
Nothing.
I'll wait.
Tell me.
What about Carlos?
Didn't he say anything else?
Nothing.
They search him?
Yes.
Then they took away the five thousand.
Yes.
-You're sure he didn't slip the five thousand to you?
-No.
You're sure?
What?
Lovain took the money. I saw him put it in his desk.
You said Gaby couldn't write because she was watched.
Yes.
But in a little while she'll be able to see me.
That's funny.
He's going to move away.
Oh, I see.
-But why couldn't she write to me?
-He was there.
But she talked to you.
Because.
Because you don't know.
Now there is another thing that doesn't fit in your story.
How was Louvain able to take 5000 francs from Carlos when Carlos didn't have a hundred?
I don't know.
Do you think Carlos is dumb enough to give you my letter?
All joking aside.
Do you think me so stupid as to believe he would give it to you?
-All joking aside.
-I give you my word.
-And then I will go down to see her.
-Yes.
A woman who is closely watched, it's funny the way she can do things.
Now I've laughed enough!
Do you hear me?
You've made a fool of me!
Carlos was arrested.
Now tell me what happened.
Shall I break your neck to refresh your memory?
No, Pepe.
Slimane planned it all.
Yeah?
He told me to come for you.
- Go on. 
 - He thinks you'll come down.
- Then?
The hotel is surrounded, they're waiting.
Did you see the girl?
No.
Why didn't she come up yesterday?
He told her you'd been killed.
Slimane planned the whole thing.
Is that all?
Yes.
Thanks.
You can't do it, Pepe.
You can't leave me. What have I done?
It has nothing to do with you, Ines.
You're a good kid, but this can't be helped.
It's not your fault.
I won't let you do it. I won't let you. You'll be killed.
Blame it on the Casbah.
It's for her. You don't care about anything else, so you're throwing away your life.
But it's my own life.
Don't do it, Pepe. Don't go. Listen to me.
Pepe.
Wait.
We didn't expect you.
He's not coming here.
He's gone to the boat.
You expect me to believe that?
He is going away with her.
So you're the one to betray him.
You couldn't wait to run to me.
You call it love, but it means you'd kill him before you'd let him go free. That's what you've done.
Sure as if you'd held a gun in your hands.
I couldn't let him go.
I couldn't lose him.
I thought I'd figured all the moves, but I miscalculated.
I didn't think of you.
That's just fine.
In a few more minutes, it might have been put of our hands.
Don't go.
-Give him a chance.
-I did.
But you knew. You planned it this way.
So he'd walk into a trap. And he's done it with your help.
Come on.
You know, the pleasant thing about travelling is going back home.
It's like going away again.
Oh I had a good time. Didn't you, Andre?
Me?
I never laughed so much in my life.
You see, Pepe, we meet at the appointed time.
Tell the truth.
I almost missed the appointment.
Not here.
As you wish.
I can't refuse an old friend.
All aboard who goes on board.
Let me wait here until it leaves.
It's not much to ask.
I can't get away.
I know I can trust you.
Gaby.
Gaby.
Gaby.
Gaby.
Gaby.
Gaby.
I'm sorry, Pepe.
He thought you were going to escape.
And so I have, my friend.
Marvelous .. terrific. Bottoms-up boys.
Did you call that a landing?
─ Well, we're down aren't we.
Yeah, we're upside down.
Well, I must have hit a bump.
─ No, you didn't.
You just made another lousy landing. That's all.
How do I get out of this?
Well, you ought to know.
It's your sixth crack-up.
What's that to you?
─ Nothing at all. Nothing at all.
Except that as a pilot, you're an A.1. gunner.
Oh yeah .. I can fly alright.
─ Sure, sure. You make nice landings too.
Well, nobody can fly these cockeyed training hacks.
It's a cinch you can't.
What's so funny?
─ You are. Look at yourself.
Lay off!
Alright, alright, alright. You don't need to get up on your ear about it.
I'm just trying to teach you how to ..
You'd better see how you can duck those bullets before telling me what to do.
Hiya Mike. What are you two guys doing? Looking for wrangle-worms?
Yeah.
─ Well, you're out of season.
Lovely fellow. What was the argument about?
This. He thinks it's pretty good landing.
What's the matter with it? You were able to walk out of it, ain't you ..
Yeah, we can walk.
The Colonel wants you immediately, sir.
─ The Colonel, eh?
My compliments to the Colonel, and tell him to keep his shirt on.
It would be a lovely war, you know
Mike, if it weren't for Colonels.
Yeah, and the Army.
Hold everything! Hold everything! I've got some terrible news for you gentlemen.
We're going to France.
─ No!
Nobody told me, I was peeking through the Colonel's keyhole.
Listen, the Colonel's giving Jerry all the dope. He's on his way down here.
Boys, this time tomorrow we'll be up there taking a crack at them.
Yeah, and vice-versa.
I say Gerry, when are we going?
─ Where are we going? Who's going?
What's this all about anyhow?
─ Who told you?
A little bird.
Mike?
─ Cheep cheep ..
[ whistling ]
Well, here's the dope. We leave at seven in the morning.
What's the Colonel think I got? Insomnia?
That's no time to crawl out of a warm bed. Make it noon.
The Colonel asked me to give you the list.
Thomas?
─ Yes.
Travis?
─ Yes sir.
Galloway?
─ Half way to France.
Wilson?
─ Here.
Baxter?
─ Rather.
Smith?
─ Smythe if you don't mind. But I'm here.
Harolds?
─ Present.
Richards?
─ Who, me?
Boy I won't have to go to the dentist tomorrow.
That's the list gentlemen .. Let's go.
I tell you what we do. Go to Princes for dinner, and go on to Murrays afterwards.
Hey.
Haven't you forgotten something?
I don't get you.
Well, my name is not on that list.
What did you have to do with it?
Well uh .. the Colonel asked me if I thought you could fly ..
Sure, I know, and you told him I couldn't.
Now listen ..
You're the best gunner in the bunch.
But you're going to kill yourself if you keep on trying to fly.
Well, It's my life ain't it?
You couldn't mind your own business. You had to queer the one thing I wanted to do.
You got me grounded.
─ No. You're going to be an Observer.
An Observer, huh?
That will be fun.
I'm going to stay here in England and ..
You're going to France.
Well, take this with you ..
Hogan!
─ Hello.
Here's your replacements.
Where?
─ Up there.
Strewth!
Here we are.
Oui, oui. It's my day in France.
Oh .. boy!
Oh boy, I wonder how far we are from Paris.
Did you see those shells bursting up there?
Listen. It reminds me of the
4th of July at Patooka.
I hope they send us over today.
Yeah, well if they do, I want to get back in time for supper.
Is this the uh ..?
─ Let me handle it.
Comment ca va? Nous sommes deux aviators.
From Le squadrone over the .. Angleterre.
Voulez-vous annoncez deux?
A la Commandante. Tres vite ..
You didn't know I spoke French, did you?
─ No, do you?
Are you two gentlemen the new replacements?
Yeah, I guess we are.
─ I'll have your kit sent over right away.
Hogan!
─ Sir?
Take these gentlemen to their quarters.
─ I thought this was planned ..
Mr Kingsford? This is Mr Young.
Your new pilot, sir.
Glad to see you.
─ I'm glad to be here.
Well, dump your stuff and make yourself at home.
Just arrived?
─ Yes, just.
Do you mind if I wash up a bit?
─ Why, go ahead.
I'll get some hot water sir.
─ Here's a clean towel.
Thank you.
Have a good trip over?
─ Yes, fine thanks.
I say, you're American, aren't you?
─ Yeah. How did you guess?
"Young", sir?
Right here.
Major Dunham would like to see you at once, sir.
You take off in 10 minutes Mr Kingsford.
─ Thanks.
Ten minutes, eh?
Hey, better take your flying gear, we're going to do a show.
Are we? Right away?
─ Yes.
Don't waste any time, do they.
Hey Mike.
─ What?
Did they send for you too?
You don't think I'm calling the Major for fun do you?
Come on, let's be in there.
Major Dunham?
─ Yes, that's right.
We're Young and Richards, sir.
Oh yes. Oh, the two Americans.
How are you? Glad to have you with us.
How was your trip across? Tiresome?
─ Not at all.
In fact, I could go back again right away.
How's everything in London?
Last we saw of Piccadilly Circus, things seemed to be going round and round.
And around.
Well, things go round and round out here too sometimes.
You've only got one job here, and that's to take photographs.
And to bring them back. That means flying close to the ground.
Where the enemy can shoot at you with everything he's got.
Everything?
─ Everything.
Come in Kingsford.
The ship is ready, sir.
There's a new .. a new enemy battery.
Reported G.4. .. H.3.
Now GHQ wants photographs at once.
Kingsford here is an old hand. You do the flying, and he'll do the rest.
We'll get them for you, sir.
─ That's the stuff.
Off you go. Good luck to you.
Well, good day sir.
─ Oh one moment ..
I'll give you your instructions in a few minutes.
I can hardly wait.
It's swell. I didn't have any idea
I'd get to go up so soon.
All of a sudden.
─ Yeah.
Well, that lets me out.
Look Mike, you want to go up in my place?
─ Oh no thanks, I'm tired.
Seven months of training for this first minute of action.
Yeah, seven months? I did seven years.
Nervous?
─ Oh, you know, just a little.
If his heart wasn't in his mouth, you'd hear his teeth chatter.
This is an easy one. Jump over the line and keep your eyes open.
And if you see anything you think I haven't seen, hit me .. I'll do the same.
Oh we'll be alright.
I know I'll be alright, because I'm staying here.
If you come back,
I'll be waiting for you.
Major Dunham's orders, sir.
You take off immediately.
Who, me?
─ Yes, sir.
What? .. Sir?
Hey Mike! I got one, I got two!
Tell me about it. You got two?
Oh that's terrific. How did you do it? Tell me ..
Did, did you get back alright?
─ Well, look at me. Here I am.
Two arms, two legs, two of everything.
─ See anything?
The last time I opened my eyes, one of them big black things up there went "boom".
Oh you got two. Listen if you get two a day you get ..
Okay, okay. Oh boy what a kill.
First time over the lines too. Why didn't someone tell me about this line of work ..
Now then, lower him ..
Alright men. Come on, stand back.
─ He's got it proper, he has.
Did you get your photographs, Young?
He's dead.
Yes, I know .. but did you get your photographs?
Oh ..
Yeah ..
Was it my fault, sir?
─ Nobody's fault.
But he's dead.
I'm afraid you'll have to get used to that.
You don't waste any time, do you.
No sir .. that's the third officer I've lost today.
Too bad about Mr Kingsford sir.
He was a nice chap Mr Kingsford.
That's his wife and child, sir.
Alan is dead.
─ Yes, I know.
That's the fifth observer
I've lost in two months.
Yes, but this is war, and death is what we've got to expect.
Yes, I know sir. But five?
─ Stop thinking about it.
I can't.
You volunteered for this war. Now what was in your mind when you came into it?
Well, I wanted to fly. I thought there would be some sport in it.
I thought I'd be fighting alone ..
I didn't expect to be a chauffeur for a graveyard ..
Driving men to their death day-after-day.
Yet that's just exactly what it is.
Day after day ..
Yes .. and maybe tomorrow you won't come back.
Have you thought about that?
─ Oh that doesn't matter.
Oh that's where you're wrong. It does.
What do you suppose they gave you that Cross for?
Oh some absurd idea about bravery.
─ Nothing of the sort.
Oh, of course that was part of it.
But whether you like it or not ..
You're becoming a shining example to these youngsters who are coming out to us.
You don't know it .. but we're telling them: be like Young.
Get yourselves a Cross. Cover yourselves with decorations.
Oh, I see.
Sort of a "shining-example" then?
─ That's it.
Gee, it's a swell job for a guy.
Yes, but it's your job and you've got to finish it.
Yeah .. I know.
That's alright.
Too bad about Mr Alan, sir.
He was a nice young chap Mr Alan.
Oh well .. they come and they go.
Let me see now. There was Mr Alan ..
Mr Caruthers .. Mr Howard .. Mr Warner.
Mr .. ?
You know sir, that nice gentleman with the wife and child sir.
Kingsford.
Kingsford. That's right sir, yes.
Good night sir.
Are you my new Observer?
Yeah.
Well, well .. I gather you lost five men in two months.
Whose fault was that? Yours or theirs?
I wish I knew.
─ Yeah, that would be nice.
Funny you being assigned to me, Crocker.
─ No it isn't.
I asked for it.
I thought you didn't like me.
─ I don't.
Then, what the ..?
─ Curiosity fellah .. curiosity.
I heard about you and your medal.
I wanted to see how you did it.
And how long you could keep on doing it.
How can you tell?
I'm likely to get mine any minute.
─ I didn't mean that.
I was just wondering how long you'd go on before your nerves would go to pieces.
Hmm.
You think I'm yellow, eh?
─ Sure .. I know you are.
Remember that day when I laid one on your jaw and you went down and stayed there?
Remember that?
─ Yeah .. yeah, I remember.
Suppose it was me you'd socked on the jaw, what do you think I'd have done?
I don't know.
Well, what would you do?
Now wait a minute!
You just got out here and you don't know what it's all about yet.
But as long as you're here, you and I have a job to do .. together unfortunately.
You just stick in the back end of the bus, and I'll stick in the front.
And I'll take you anywhere you want to go.
Just see that you don't miss anything.
Want a drink?
Well, well, it's him in short pants.
If it ain't old stick-in-the-mud.
Why, you're still the funny-fellah, huh?
None of that backseat driving there, sunshine.
Oh lay off.
Hiya Slug.
─ What do you say Jerry?
They tell me to keep flying this guy right, so they give you another ribbon.
Don't you worry about it. You worry about your own decorations.
The way I'm missing those enemy planes, they ought to be giving me the Iron Cross.
Hey, you sap.
─ Not me.
Whenever there's dangerous work to be done, who is the Major paging?
Me? .. Never ..
He asks for Lieutenant Jerry Young, that guy with the ribbons on his chest.
Can I help it?
─ Not now, you can't. You are marked.
You see any ribbons on my chest though?
No, you never will.
There'll never be an officer look at me and say "there's a brave man".
"Let's get him to do the dirty work."
What did you join this army for, you sap?
What are you trying to do? Kill me?
And who's flying this ship, anyway?
You made me miss. I had him cold.
─ That's what I tried to do.
Yeah, well not next time you ..
A little higher .. a little higher.
Now .. what was that you were saying up there?
What's the matter? Did your guns jam?
─ Yeah, they jammed.
And next time you pull one like that, I'll jam them down the back of your skull.
Next time you take a pop at a fellah in a parachute, you won't get a chance to.
What do you want me to do, kiss him?
You alright Jerry?
─ Yeah, by the skin of my teeth.
I nearly caught in on that last dive.
Sweet Christopher, can that Green-Tail fly!
You should have seen him ride me down in a spin. I tried everything.
He was on my tail all the way.
─ Yeah, well how about the ..?
Oh, he's a great gunner. He shot down a defenceless observer at 600 yards.
".. over us, one little game for all of us .. one little .. "
Oh .. I'm poison, huh?
Well, not that it makes any difference, but what is it?
Well it's simply this old boy.
We don't shoot down observers when they get in your way in parachutes.
I don't get it.
That fellah was in an observation balloon.
Maybe he observed something that would help the enemy wipe out this whole sector.
I kept him from landing with that information.
And for that, I'm a dirty-deuce?
Well, maybe you can tell me why?
It's shooting a man in the back.
Nobody does it. That's all.
Sort of a gentleman's agreement old chap.
Say mister, why don't you get wise ..?
─ Why don't you get wise? This is a war!
I'm hired to kill the enemy .. and there ain't no book of rules about that.
Every one I've put away means one less to kill me.
That's my job, and I'm doing it.
─ You're doing it darn well, but get this!
You're not popping off guys in parachutes from any ship I'm flying.
Well that settles that, as my grandma said. Who's going to buy the next drink?
What's your pleasure, gentlemen?
" .. bombed last night .. bombed the night before .."
" .. we're going to get bombed tonight, as we've never been bombed before .."
Come in.
Hello Crocker.
─ Hello sir.
Where's Young?
─ Oh ..
I don't know .. he and Richards are around somewhere I guess.
I suppose I'll have to turn out the guard to find him.
Anything wrong?
─ What? No, no.
Only GHQ has just telephoned.
A French General will be here in an hour to decorate him with the Crois De Guerre.
Oh, another medal, huh?
Well, I suppose he deserves it.
You're getting one too, Crocker.
I'll go and get him .. I think he's over at Madame's.
Oh no, never mind. I'll send an orderly.
I uh ..
I suppose he's getting blotto again?
Well, what if he is?
─ Oh, he's drinking too much lately.
Look, Major.
Maybe it wouldn't be a bad idea if other fellahs tried the same brand of whiskey.
Well, I just wanted to know how you felt about him.
Well, don't get me wrong about him, Major.
I don't like that sort of talk.
─ No?
Then, why are going out in this rain to find him?
Well, I'm darned if I know.
Oh come on Jerry, snap out of it will you.
I wish I could get it out of my mind you know.
When you see a guy like that, falling and burning, you know he hasn't got a chance.
You can't snap a picture like that out of your mind.
You don't drink enough.
─ I can't drink enough.
Hey Fanny.
─ Richards?
Comment l'omelette?
That meaning in English
"how's the omelette?"
Coming up, handsome.
You get that? I've been teaching her English.
English?
─ Night school.
He don't believe me Fanny. Put that omelette down there and show him.
Yes, so ..
Voila! .. See?
Mike give you that?
─ Uhuh. It has learnt me good.
The "Big Stiff".
That's what I told you to call the Major, not me.
Okay baby!
Why? .. You no eat? Not you?
You old "son-of-a-gun".
─ What?
He told me your father was of much importance. He was a "big-gun".
So, you are "son-of-a-gun".
Hiya. Hello, you son-of-a ..
Not while I'm here. Shush .. good morning.
What was that?
Oh Mike, just been kidding along with Madame.
Hey, I've been looking for you. The Major wants you.
Me? What for? What does he want?
He's going to hang another medal on you.
Tell him I've got a medal.
─ Well, I see he's going to have two.
Come on.
Bon soir mes amis.
─ Bon soir Madame.
Wait a bit, I'm going too.
Well Fanny, you don't know how much we enjoyed that meal. The omelette was terrific.
Sorry I can't stay and finish it.
Here you are honey.
Oh!
Kiss me Fanny.
Go on Fanny, give it to him.
He's getting it.
Oh, just too rich for the blood.
Well, goodbye Fanny.
How many times must I tell you: my name is "Fifi"
Well .. yeah.
Why you might be "Fifi" to the rest of the world, but you're "Fanny" to me.
Goodbye honey.
─ Haha, good day.
Hey, what's the big idea?
Cool your head off. You can't fall on your face when you're getting a medal.
Listen, I'm alright.
Attention!
[ french ]
Jerry Young.
Royal Flying Corps.
He's going to get your telephone number again. Here he comes, look.
[ french ]
What did he say?
He says you're drinking lousy cognac.
He's going to send you some real stuff.
[ french ]
Michael Richards.
Royal Flying Corps.
Now he's going to get your telephone number, Mike.
Gesundheit!
Au revoir, messieurs.
Well, rather pretty old boy, eh what?
I got this ribbon for being the best dog in the show.
I say, is it really yours?
Well, I had to kiss the
General's ass to get it.
But, what's that to a hero?
Yes, I guess there's only a few of us left.
Boys, I want to tell you, unaccustomed as I am to public drinking.
I just want to tell you, don't get discouraged, see.
Because as long as they keep giving these medals out, that'll keep the war going.
When there's work to be done. Who will the Major page now?
Come on there Hogan, give us that champagne.
It was a great day Hogan,
I want to tell you.
Are you Mr Richards?
One of you gentlemen, tell this boy who I am.
The worst impostor in France.
─ The worst pilot in France.
In the whole world.
─ The teacher's pet.
My pals ..
What's on your mind, son?
─ I'm Johnny Stevens, your new observer.
Observer? Hey Jerry!
Tell us what you do to come out a little. Look, I'm father.
Observer? Step up to the bar, son.
Would you like to have a drink?
─ Sure, thanks.
Hogan .. give my son a bowl of milk, will you.
Could I have a little whiskey?
─ Whiskey? Whiskey?
Give him a little whiskey and a bowl of milk.
You know, look out for this whiskey, it's kinda strong, son. Knock you down.
Weaned in a distillery.
This is our mess gentlemen .. you know, we're not long on formality here.
Now, if you come along, you shall meet some of our men.
We'll give you the drug-store and 800 dollars.
You want them to get on with the war, you want ..
Congratulations Jerry.
─ Oh, thank you sir.
I'm proud of you, looks great.
Hope you get a lot more of them.
Thanks.
There's a new batch of youngsters just come up.
Just babies, huh?
─ Yes, I know.
I want you to say a few words to them.
─ Oh no, no.
Yes, yes. Great for their morale.
Buck them up no end.
A "shining-example" huh?
Yes, that's it .. now come along.
Gentlemen .. gentlemen.
You've probably all heard of Jerry Young.
And I dare say that some of you know the sort of things that he does.
Well, I want you to meet him.
My pleasure.
How do you do, sir.
─ How do you do.
I hope we'll all get to know each other better.
Well, go on .. I've asked him to say a few words to you.
I .. I don't know what to tell you.
Well Jerry, they're all interested in your latest victory.
Wasn't much of a victory .. single combat.
Crocker and I were lucky, that's all.
There are a thousand more chaps like the one we got this afternoon.
We need you.
And I might tell you .. the first time you shoot down a man ..
Don't let it get to you.
Don't .. just try to remember that ..
The cause you're fighting for .. is right and just.
They are your enemies.
You are fighting for humanity.
And for the .. preservation of civilization.
I guess that's all.
─ Thanks.
Is that what you wanted?
─ Yes, that's just exactly what we want.
Get down you fools! Get down!
Alright Major?
─ Hey Mike, those kids ..
Thanks.
Yet .. I didn't even get to the front.
Not a chance to do anything .. did I?
No .. only die ..
Somebody will get a nice, shiny medal for this.
Come on fellahs, can't do any good here .. not now .. come on boys.
There you are .. there you are .. there you are.
There you are, you got it.
Shoot .. shoot!
You got him .. you got him!
He's burning .. got it ..
There .. there you are ..
There you are, you got him .. you got him ..
You got him .. you got him!
Is that him?
Yeah .. he's burning, he's burning ..
There you are .. there you are, there you go.
Don't shoot, shoot, shoot it. Shoot.
I lost five .. I lost five .. I lost five!
I lost five sir. I know sir, but five.
Five in two months sir. Five .. five sir.
Kingsford .. Howard .. Warner.
Caruthers .. Alan.
Kingsford, Howard, Warner.
Caruthers, Alan.
You're fighting a great fight .. fighting for humanity.
For the preservation of civilization.
Kid .. kid .. little boys .. little boy .. look Mike.
Look Mike, they're burning.
Look Mike, they're burning!
Oh blood .. blood .. stinky blood Mike.
Mike, I can't stand it ..
I can't stand it, Mike ..
I can't stand it, I'm going to stop it. I'm going to stop it.
I'm going to stop the whole, rotten mess. Now listen ..
Look out Mike .. look out Mike!
He's right on your tail.
Look out Mike!
Come in.
Anything wrong?
What do you mean?
I heard an awful racket and I thought somebody else was hurt.
No, just me having a bit of a nightmare.
Oh I'm sorry .. I didn't mean to disturb you. I'm ..
Oh that's alright.
Gee ..
Must be great to be able to wear those.
Look at him .. after all he's been through .. and sleeping like that.
Yeah .. wonderful.
Pretty awful, wasn't it ..
Seems a pity .. all those boys.
Well, I guess if they hadn't got it that way, they'd have got it some other way.
Well, what's on your mind?
I want to be assigned to another pilot.
What for?
I'm afraid I ..
─ But you're not afraid of anything.
Oh, I'm afraid to ride with him anymore.
He's cracking.
Oh .. so that's it, is it?
Well, if you think I'm going to break up the only team I can rely on ..
You are badly mistaken.
I'll give him ten days leave .. today.
That ought to put him straight.
─ It might.
And when he comes back, you'll fly with him.
That's all.
─ Thank you sir.
Probably wondered what it's all about.
The one in red hasn't got crosses or circles on its wings.
I hope it ain't a bomber.
You know, here she goes, sir.
Hogan, Hogan, Hogan! .. That's hot!
It was so hot I couldn't hold it, sir.
─ Go away from me. Don't bother me.
I wonder if he's on our side.
Say Mike.
─ What?
Look after yourself, will you.
─ What do you mean?
Oh, I had a dream last night, and you got all mixed up with Green-Tail.
Hmm. I told you, I'm getting a long, white beard.
Morning Major.
─ Morning.
I've got good news for you, Jerry.
─ What's that, sir?
You're going on ten days leave.
I didn't ask for leave, Major.
─ No, I know you didn't.
But I thought it would do you good.
You know .. change of scene and change of talk.
When do I go?
─ Immediately.
In time to catch the afternoon leave-boat.
Boy, London and clean sheets, huh?
─ Yeah, and a private bathtub.
Yes .. and it means double work for you while he's away.
Makes no difference to me. Just so I get my
Thursdays off, and every other Sunday.
Hey Major ..
If Richards is going to fly tough jobs, he ought to have Crocker as his gunner.
Yes, well we'll do that.
─ Good.
Come on, what's the idea? You know
I don't like that guy Crocker.
Don't be a sap, he's the best gunner in the outfit.
If you're together, you'll both be here when I get back. Listen Mike ..
What do you want me to bring you back from London? Anything you say.
Anything?
─ Yeah, anything I can bring back here.
Well my second choice is ..
You know the little place on Jermyn Street that sells that Gorgonzola cheese?
Listen, bring me back a piece that will come to me when I whistle it will you.
Okay.
Hot-damn boy.
─ Come on boy, I gotta pack.
He's got me!
Hey! .. Listen, when you get to that place that sells the ..
Then my dear chap, when the barrage lifted we counter-attacked.
Drove them from the woods.
And in my position, they followed it with machine guns on our left flank.
By Jove, we drove them back.
What do you think of that?
Marvelous.
The most wonderful thing was that he was shot down in flames from 12,000 feet.
And like a torch he was, at night.
Ever see anything like that Jerry?
Yes .. I'm afraid gentlemen, if you'll excuse me, I've got to be going.
Goodnight.
Jerry, it's been wonderful to have you here. I hope you've had a good time.
It's been charming.
I thought it would be a relief after all you've been through.
Yes, thanks.
But before you go, there is one member of the household that you haven't seen.
And he's terribly anxious to meet you .. my youngest.
Tommy .. this is Jerry Young.
How do you do Tommy.
─ I'm fine sir.
Is it true that you shot down 18 planes?
I guess it is.
I'm planning to be a flyer just like you, just as soon as I get time.
Do you think I would make a good flyer?
─ Oh wonderful. You're perfect for it.
It must be fun, isn't it?
─ Well, not exactly Tommy.
Don't you like to kill the enemy?
─ Oh yes, yes. Of course.
Tell me about it. Tell me about all of it ..
Well .. I'm afraid I wouldn't have time for that, son.
What do they look like when they fall, sir?
Are they on fire?
Sometimes, yes.
─ Do they look like a roman-candle?
Yes .. yes, like a roman-candle.
Do they explode with a great, big bang?
Yes .. a great big bang.
Good night sir.
Go up to bed, son.
Can I drop you somewhere?
─ I don't want to be dropped.
I want a cigarette.
And now what?
─ Where are you going?
I hadn't thought, perhaps around the park?
Tell him that then.
Through the park.
─ Right-oh governor.
Pretty bad wasn't it?
Well it was alright until the kid came down.
You can't get away from it, can you.
─ How did you know that?
I've been watching you all evening, but you didn't see me, did you?
I'm sorry .. I'm afraid I didn't.
Do you like this driving round and round?
─ No, not much.
Perhaps you'd like to go somewhere?
─ I think you need a glass of champagne.
Oh, I couldn't stand to go to a nightclub or anything like that.
Let's have it here in the park .. in the moonlight.
Stop the driver and send him for some.
Stop here.
Rush off somewhere and get a bottle of champagne and bring it back here, will you.
Right-oh governor.
You are ill, aren't you?
No, no I'm alright, I'm perfectly fine.
Come over here and sit down.
Why are you doing this?
Don't you like it?
I like it very much.
Well?
Only I uh ..
I don't seem to know what to talk about.
─ Why talk?
Oh, here he is ..
Here you are governor.
─ Thank you.
That's fine.
Just .. wait for us, will you.
─ Right-oh sir.
Moonlight .. quiet .. romance.
Champagne.
─ Uhuh.
Thank you.
Why? .. That's what I want to know.
Why?
─ Tell me about it.
No, there's nothing to tell.
It's the same old thing, over and over again.
Day after day ..
─ Well ..
Well you see .. I thought it was like a game.
Pool .. or something like that.
And on the first time I went up, I brought down a plane. That started it.
That started everything.
A treadmill.
Somebody slapped me on the back and told me I was great, and I had to go on.
More planes ..
More dead men ..
More medals ..
There isn't any end .. then what do you think happened to me?
I was what they called a "shining-example".
Could there be anything more terrible than that?
A "shining-example".
The only way I can go on is to kill somebody.
When I get up in the morning, the first thing I say to myself is ..
Well, you've got to do it again today.
Because if you don't do it ..
You know what I'm talking about.
Yes.
They bring young boys ..
Only kids, just away from their mothers, who don't know anything.
And then they point to me and they say: "be like him. Be like him".
That's what I've got to do.
You don't think I'm afraid, do you?
I know you are not afraid.
Every time I knock some poor devil down, burning, they buy me drinks.
Oh my dear .. oh my dear ..
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have bothered you.
You didn't bother me.
You've been awfully kind.
I want to be kind.
Hello Jerry!
─ Hello boys!
Hi Jerry!
─ Hello Jerry ..
Have a good trip?
─ Yeah, swell.
Look, he's back sober! Welcome back from the battle of Piccadilly!
Where's Mike?
He and Crocker are out on a show.
─ He'll be back pretty soon.
What is it, Scotch?
─ No, I bought it for Mike. Smell it.
Oooo! Hang some black crepe on it.
Is he's going to eat it?
─ Sure he is ..
That looks like Mike now.
─ Yeah, that looks like him.
Hey Mike! Mike ..
Ah, bonjour mon ami.
Mon ami.
Oh you must have mixed with somebody.
La fromage! Pour votre Marie.
There you are my lad.
The most thoroughly disreputable cheese in the entire British Empire.
Oh, what a lovely stink ..
What a dogfight you must have been through.
Hello Crocker.
─ Hello Jerry.
What happened?
─ Green-Tail.
I got Mike to turn back so I could take a crack at him.
I did .. but he took forty-nine at us.
Well, I guess we're lucky to be here.
─ I'll say you are.
Mike .. Mike ..
Hey Mike .. Mike, you can't do that.
I'm alright .. a little gas ..
I guess it must be the cheese.
Mike .. Mike!
─ Mike!
Do something! Get an ambulance. Hurry up.
Major, you're wanted.
Richards is wounded.
Careful, watch his head now ..
Gently .. gently.
Come on Mike .. easy, easy.
He's dead.
Well, you got your crack at Green-Tail, Crocker.
You got Richards to go back and tangle with him, eh?
Couldn't be satisfied to get your pictures and come on home.
You had to fight and kill somebody.
─ Wait a minute Jerry.
Well you did it! You killed somebody ..
You killed the best guy that ever flew in France.
You and I are washed up Crocker.
On the ground and in the air.
Hogan .. transfer Mr Crocker's gear.
Mr Stevens is flying with me.
They bombed 86th Squadron last night.
Killed eleven men, and destroyed the hangars.
I heard about it .. a rotten show.
We want photographs of their aerodrome.
We're going to make a counter-raid.
Where is it?
Well GHQ thinks its uh ..
Thinks it's about .. here ..
Well, get back as soon as you can.
Jerry.
You know that's a tough section .. well patrolled.
You're liable to be attacked.
I wouldn't give you odds.
Wouldn't you rather have Crocker with you, than that youngster?
No thanks. I'll take Stevens.
I see.
Well, happy landing.
Thank you sir.
All set Johnny?
─ Right-oh.
Keep an eye on the sun.
Don't let anybody sneak up under your tail.
Oh lummy, what a crack-up that was, eh.
Have we got him?
The bloke put up a good fight, just the same.
Here he comes ..
─ Here's the bloke what got him!
Well done, Flying Corps.
Jolly fine show I calls it ..
Why that's the stuff to give them.
He never had no hope, he never.
Where's your pal?
He fell out .. he fell all the way ..
His first flight.
You bleeding well finished the other kid.
Did you kill him? .. Great work.
Do you know who it is?
─ No.
It's "Voss" .. the great ace.
─ Voss?
He was a holy terror.
─ He was the greatest flyer they had.
Just a kid.
You'll get a citation for this.
Hello Jerry. See you're back again.
Good show old boy.
They'll give you a commendation for this.
─ Well done Jerry. How'd you do it?
What's the matter with him?
─ The way he's acting over it.
Voss! .. An ace!
You got a combat-report blank?
Too bad about Stevens.
Yeah.
Too bad.
".. and he impressed his last few guests, before he passed away."
"I'll tell you how it happened, on another day .."
What do you want?
─ They're waiting for you in there.
Major Dunham sent me.
Well, I'm not going.
Well, that's alright with me, but they're giving this binge in your honor.
A binge to celebrate the killing of a twenty-year old kid.
Gee .. that's great.
I wouldn't miss it for anything.
Sure I'll go.
Here's Jerry now. Come on Jerry.
Mr Crocker, come here.
We've been waiting for you Jerry.
Come along Jerry .. we've imported some real food.
And the General has sent up a case of '98 Clicquot.
Gentlemen .. I think we ought to start this affair ..
With a toast to Jerry.
Gentlemen .. Jerry Young.
Well done Jerry ..
Everybody up.
I'm drinking to the man I killed.
─ Voss!
Thanks for the binge, boys .. it's an honor.
Too bad Stevens can't be here.
It would have meant a lot to him.
He fell out .. 3,000 feet.
I wouldn't have got Voss if he hadn't come at me head-on.
I went to the field hospital to see him.
I thought I'd find a man.
I found a blond kid .. like a lot of you!
Two bullet-holes in him.
They congratulated me for it.
Congratulated me all day .. told me I'd done a great thing.
They set me up a shiny, tin
God. A hero .. an ace!
They expect me to act like a hero.
So you can all play at being heroes.
So you can go out and shoot other kids down, and get killed yourselves.
They'll decorate you for it.
They'll give you medals.
Just like they did me!
I got these for killing kids!
They are all chunks of torn flesh .. and broken bones .. and blood!
And .. for .. WHAT?
I give you .. WAR!
Drunk as an owl.
─ Ha, I'll say he is.
Blotto.
─ And who has a better right?
Another bottle of wine, Hogan ..
[ Gunshot! ]
[ door knocks ]
Come in.
Hello Crocker.
Hello sir.
I got him to bed alright sir.
─ Oh good.
I see .. he got drunk quickly, didn't he?
Yes sir.
Yes .. well, he'll be alright in the morning.
I hope so sir.
─ He's got an easy show tomorrow.
Yes sir.
He ..
He asked me to fly with him, sir.
─ So?
Oh .. oh, I'm glad of that.
Yes sir.
You are sure there is nothing I can do?
No sir.
Goodnight Crocker.
─ Goodnight sir.
Subs: T-G. 2015.
Right through the lung.
Bell, dismount the men.
Yes, Sergeant.
Dismount!
Pity.
- Decent boy, in some ways.
- Yeah, no soldier though.
- See the blighter what done it?
- No.
Blasted Arabs. Hide like sand flies.
Never see them.
There's them GS shovels.
Will I get two or three of the blokes to start in?
Right.
Sanders!
Corporal.
Brown.
Here.
Hand your horses over to McKay.
Put your rifles back in your buckets and get them GS shovels.
What happened?
There was a shot and then the officer...
Is dead, my lad. Gwendolyn is napoo.
We are gravediggers.
Understand now, young fellow, my lad?
But out here?
Where are we gonna bury him?
Doesn't make much difference, does it?
- All right, men, that'll do.
- Gonna mark it?
What's the good? Bell, mount the men.
Sergeant.
Haven't you forgotten something?
Oh.
Go ahead, Sanders.
"Almighty Father...
"we commend the soul of our brother departed...
"and we commit his body to the ground.
"Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust...
"in sure and certain hope of the resurrection...
- "unto eternal life, through our Lord."
- Amen.
I'm sorry, Sergeant, but that's not the entire service.
Sorry, Sanders, but we gotta be moving.
If we stick around here... we'll be patting you and a couple of others in the face with a spade.
Put your topi on.
All right, men.
Return to your horses.
Morelli, do you see anything?
No. Nothing but sand. Plenty of it.
Corporal Bell.
Yes, Sergeant?
- Do you know where we are?
- No.
Do you know what we're here for?
Do you know where we're going?
- No.
- Well, neither do I.
Huh?
That young lad, that officer back there, never gave me his orders.
What?
I ask him four or five times, and he'd always say...
"I'll do that, Sergeant, tomorrow."
Well, here's our tomorrow.
A nice one, too, ain't it?
Didn't he have them on him?
Wasn't they in his pocket?
No, kept them in his head.
A fat lot of good that'll do us now.
Where are we going now?
What are we gonna do?
Well, we're lost.
You heard me. Lost.
What are you figuring on doing?
Well, I've worked it out the best I can.
We're heading due north.
We ought to hit the river tomorrow night.
Yes, we may hit the river and that'll be that. But what else will we hit?
Yeah. A fine thing, ain't it, huh?
A patrol patrolling and not knowing where they're at... and the orders locked up in that dead kid back there.
Dismount.
That's it, Jock.
That'll do your horse good.
Pearson!
Yes, sir?
- You're a fool, Pearson.
- Yes, sir.
Now, come on.
Take it off, give it to me.
Now, come on, come on.
You know I won't drink it.
You'll have a little left for tonight.
All right, men, walk your horses.
I don't know, Jock,
I will never forget the time...
I drank the 57 bottles of beer on a bet.
It was in a bar in Calcutta, the Queen's Bar.
- Ice cold it was.
- 57 bottles.
Well, I may have miscounted a few, one way or another... but I know it was 10 below me record.
Freezing cold it was. Gave me a chill that nearly caused my death.
A pity it didn't.
All right, then.
Horse down!
Hold it! Halt!
Come on, laddie, please get up.
Too bad.
Sorry, McKay.
Here, Jock, give me that.
Take my horse. Go on with the rest.
Bell... what do you make that out to be?
Looks like something moving.
Not sure. Such a glare.
- Couldn't be the brigade, could it?
- Brigade? No.
Might be Arabs.
Morelli.
Hey, Morelli.
You're the hawk-eye of this party.
What do you make that out to be?
Trees.
Whole clump of them.
Sure it ain't a mirage?
Mirage, my aunt.
Think he's right, Bell?
Maybe and maybe not.
Maybe it is Arabs.
Arabs, my eye.
It's palms, I tell you.
It's an oasis.
That's what it is.
- Right.
- An oasis.
Prepare to mount.
Take it easy.
Take it easy, there.
Look after your horses.
That's enough.
Now come on, watch your horses.
"Oh, Mother, may I go out to swim?
"Yes, my darling daughter
"Hang your clothes on a hickory tree
But don't go near the water"
Corporal Bell, come on, get out of there.
Out, all of thee, and have some lemonade.
You forgotten yourself?
You haven't watered your own horse, have you?
Go on, get your rifle and see what's in there.
You ought to know better.
Now come on, you men, get out of there.
Aye, sir.
You can bust your own guts, but look out for your own horses.
Get your horses in there now.
Oh, Jock, boy, why, this is better than beer.
Aye.
Come on, girl.
Take it easy.
Oh, boy.
A creepy place.
What do you think?
Mohammedan mosque.
- I wonder how old it is?
- It's hard to say.
Funny.
Water, plenty of dates, this thing...
- and not a soul around.
- Yeah.
And not a ghost of an idea where we're at... what we're here for, or where we're going.
I want to see the horses.
Well, the horses look good.
I bet they feel better.
Abelson, smarten up there.
Do up that shoulder strap, and carry that rifle, don't sling it.
You're on duty.
- Is that your horse?
- Yeah.
I thought so.
Look at his back.
I've told you about this before.
You ride the officer's horse tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
Are we gonna ride tomorrow?
I said tomorrow.
We pull out before sun-up.
I say, Sergeant, did I hear you right?
- We moving out of here tomorrow?
- Yes.
Gentlemen, I am the bearer of joyful tidings.
Yeah?
We leave this charming paradise tomorrow.
Paradise?
It is the devil's own backyard.
Don't jest, Quincannon.
You know what this place really is.
I do, and I can tell you in 50 words.
And every one of them forbidden.
If you'd read your Bible... instead of hanging around canteens and native quarters all your life... you'd know that Mesopotamia... this, this very spot that you're standing on this very minute... is the actual Garden of Eden.
The Garden of Eden!
The Garden of Eden, how are you?
I tell you, it'd take no angel with a flaming sword to drive me out.
That's blasphemy, Quincannon!
- You'd better not...
- Blasphemy?
Are you aware you're talking to a man who was for 10 years an altar boy?
- How you feeling, Pearson, better?
- Oh, I feel fine, thank you, sir.
I'm sorry I wasn't quite up to it out there.
- Guess I'm not much of a soldier yet.
- You're all right, lad. You did fine.
- You'll learn.
- Thank you, sir.
Sure he'll learn.
Take for an example yon Matlow.
I remember the time when he first came to the regiment 20 years ago... the time Quincannon and myself had making a soldier of him.
Michael, do you mind the time we were at the depot at Poona together?
- I was Troop Sergeant Major at the time...
- Excuse me... but I was Troop Sergeant Major at the time.
Oh, no, Michael.
You were Troop Sergeant Major... but you had been broken for being drunk and disorderly... setting fire to your tent... and appearing on the parade ground with nothing on... but your drawers and your topi.
That's a dirty lie.
I did not set fire to my tent.
Well, as I was saying...
Matlow was no better nor no worse a soldier than he.
And look at him now.
- Quincannon.
- Sergeant.
Yeah?
How soon are we going to join up with the brigade?
I don't know.
Tomorrow, possibly the next day.
Yes, sir.
Yes, but everything's all right now, isn't it?
Why, yes, certainly.
Quincannon, have you seen that the horses are securely pegged down?
Yes, Sergeant.
Well, I want you to paste this in your hat.
Our getting back to the brigade depends entirely on our horses.
Well, we've lost one today, you know,
McKay's horse.
- Now that's bad.
- Now, don't worry, Sergeant.
They're as secure as if I was in charge myself.
They'll stand through the night.
Well, before you kip down tonight, look them over again.
All right, Sergeant.
Pearson.
I think I'll give you a whack at sentry-go tonight.
Will do you good.
Yes, sir.
All right, get your rifle and watch over the horse lines.
Yes, sir.
Well, boys, it's hotter in here than it is out there.
Aye.
Hey, here's a place there might be some shelter from the wind.
Come on, Matlow.
I say, jolly sort of place, isn't it?
There ain't no swansdown feather beds like what you got at home, Topper.
The Garden of Eden Temperance Hotel.
Brother Sanders, will you lead us in prayer, or are we to be spared that?
I likes that tune, Morelli.
That was my cue in the music halls.
When the orchestra did that... boom.
I come down rolled up in the curtain.
It always knocked them.
Topper, what is it when two things happen at the same time?
- Coincidence?
- A coincidence. That's it.
Play it again, will you, Morelli?
That's what the band was playing when we sailed from Tilbury.
And here was I, standing on the deck... and there was Molly, in a red hat, a-waving from the dock.
First time she ever saw me in my khaki, and the last sight I ever had of her.
So, there's a Molly with a red hat in your love life, is there?
Molly's me wife, Topper.
We were married that morning by the regimental chaplain.
- Married, huh?
- Got a baby.
I'm the father of a boy.
Herbert Hale Jr. II.
Got a letter when we left Cairo.
I've got a picture of the nipper here.
It's in my haversack. I'll show you.
He's two months old.
- Two months?
- Yes.
Splendid fellow, Herbert.
Nothing like a family.
It's all right, Pearson, it's me.
Now, if I was one of those sneaking
Arabs, I'd have cut your throat by now.
Well, I'm sorry, sir. I didn't think.
I mean...
I was just thinking.
What were you thinking?
Well, that moon.
It's so bright.
It sort of gets one, Sergeant.
I was just thinking that in 12 hours' time... that same moon will be shining over England.
Makes it seem sort of close.
Don't you think so, Sergeant?
I never thought of that.
- How old are you, son?
- 19, sir.
Public school?
No, I had a tutor for a while.
Just Mother and I.
She never wanted me to be away.
Guess that's why I'm here now.
I ran away.
Joined up, huh?
Well, I thought it was the right thing to do.
My uncle, well, he's in the War Office.
He wanted to wangle me a commission.
But I'd rather be on my own.
That's why I'm glad I'm here.
Oh, I suppose I'll get a commission, eventually... but it's a fine thing to come up from the ranks.
- Don't you think so, Sergeant?
- Yes.
You see, you're more on your own.
You're around fine soldiers... men like Mr. McKay and Mr. Quincannon... the kind of soldiers I read about in Kipling. I'm crazy about Kipling.
And here I am... a part of it now.
The finest thing is, they're so modest.
They don't even see the glory in it, do they?
No.
How about your mother?
What did she say about your joining up?
She didn't like it.
First time I ever saw her cry.
Well, you're lucky, son.
Nobody ever cried over me.
Well, stop looking at the moon or you'll be seeing ghosts.
And keep your eyes peeled, because we don't know what's out there, you know.
Yes, sir.
- Good night.
- Good night, Pearson.
Fall out!
Knifed in the back.
Aye, that's Arabs, Michael.
We've met it before.
The swine.
Bell, Corporal Bell!
- So help me...
- I'll get him!
Where's the horses?
They're gone!
Fall in!
Extended order.
From Cook, right turn.
Double. Left turn.
Keep 25 yards apart.
Circle the mosque.
Sergeant, I found Bell alive.
Just.
There's where the horses went.
Sergeant, can't we put something over it?
I could get a couple of sticks, Sergeant, and tie them together and...
Wait. Get Pearson's sword.
Put it there.
I think he'd like that.
See anything?
No.
Beats me, how in the name of holy...
Oh, shut up. We've chewed the blinking rag about it... all the blooming morning.
- The horses are gone, ain't they?
- Hey!
Whose fault is it the horses are gone?
Yeah, they should never have put that laddie out there, Michael.
Oh, chuck it. Chuck it!
Hey, what kind of lingo is that?
Meant to be Malayan, or possibly Javanese.
- I forget.
- Been there, Topper?
Cruised around a bit.
- What's it like?
- Ain't like this, I hopes.
Oh, palm trees.
But you don't mind the heat.
Lots of water, flowers, mountains, a breeze from the ocean.
Cruised around on a yacht most of the time.
Tell us, what did you have to drink there, besides water?
Oh, the usual.
Gin and bitters in the morning, scotch and soda in the afternoon... and at night, sparkling champagne served in a bucket of ice.
- Don't, don't.
You're breaking my heart.
- Shut up.
I can't say much for the women though.
But, oh, the girls.
All Malayan females should be poisoned at 21.
Before that, they're...
But a wee bit on the dark side, huh, Brown?
Oh yes, they're dark.
But the longer you're there, the whiter they get.
Or that's the way it seems.
That didn't bother me, Jock.
I'll never forget the first time I saw them.
We sailed into a little harbor, about sundown.
The girls all came swimming out... flowers in their long hair, singing and laughing up at us from the water.
Brown skin?
Seemed like gold to me.
A richer, deeper gold than any metal.
I can see that gold shimmer, even now, on their wet bodies... as they swam like mermaids to the rail and climbed on-board... laughing at us like a lot of shameless imps.
Ah, man, Topper...
'tis the soul of the poet you have.
They knew they were beautiful.
What happened then?
Oh, then the men came out.
Yeah, in their war canoes.
Seems they didn't quite like the way we were getting along with the girls...
- entirely too chummy.
- Did you fight?
Yeah, one fellow heaved a spear at me.
I suspect it was his girl
I had under one arm... while I was trying to heave up the anchor with the other.
Go on, go on.
Don't keep us in suspense.
- What come of it?
- Nothing. We sailed away.
Hey, but the lasses?
What about them?
Oh, later on, when we passed by the coast again... they slipped over the side and swam ashore.
- How about it?
- Oh, shut up.
Ain't you got no imagination?
But all the same, Topper, you didn't ought to leave us high and dry like that.
They want the gory details, you know, color.
What their minds will run to is far more exciting than what actually happened.
Brown!
I want a word with you.
- Go ahead.
- I would rather...
In a way, I would rather have spoken to you in private, but that'd be cowardly.
I will say it in front of these...
I will say it in spite of...
Bub, what's all this for?
It's for your sake, for you.
Oh, Brown, I implore you to listen.
Is your whole life so filled with filthy drunkenness... brawling and lust, that here now... perhaps close to your death... the only thing left for you to do is to live it all over again in your mind?
Oh, pack up. It's too hot to listen.
- But Brown...
- And don't shout so.
Brown, you're a gentleman, you've got breeding.
You must have faith.
Why?
Why?
In heaven's name, man, what do you believe in?
What do I believe in?
Would it really interest you?
Oh, a lot of things.
A good horse... steak and kidney pudding... a fellow named George Brown... the asinine futility of this war... being frightened... being drunk enough to be brave... and brave enough to be drunk.
The feel of the sea when you swim, the taste and strength of wine... the loveliness of women, the splendid, unspeakable joy of killing Arabs... the smell of incense and bacon, the weight of a fist... an old pair of shoes, toothache, triumph...
Stop!
All right.
Oh, you're barmy, soapy.
Shut your trap. Leave us alone.
- Hey, hey...
- Hey, wait a minute.
You leave him alone, Abelson.
He can't help it.
You're more offensive than he is.
- What's that?
- I said, you're offensive.
Abelson! Abelson, take it easy.
Oh, go on. You're nothing but a second-rate, broken-down, heavyweight.
If I have to get to my feet, you're gonna regret it.
- Get to your feet.
- No, no!
- Brown, no!
- Hey, wait a minute, come here!
Take it easy!
Brown! Abelson!
Put on those topis.
Sanders, come here.
You're supposed to be looking after Corporal Bell.
Get inside.
I wanna talk to you, men.
Sorry, Sergeant, about that scrap.
Must have been the heat.
- Sorry, Abelson.
- All right.
Well, what do you think of our chances here?
Well, I think the position is extremely dubious.
- Now, what do you think?
- Well, I'll tell you what I know.
Nothing.
I don't know where we are.
I don't know where we're going.
I don't even know where the brigade is.
It's my fault. It's me.
I told you I was a Jonah.
Bad luck, that's me.
Bad luck, if you say so.
Of course, our horses are pinched.
That's Arabs.
What's your opinion, McKay?
How many out there?
Well, we examined the tracks of the horses. There's not many.
- That's just what I think.
- How so, Sergeant?
Well, if there'd been more than a few... they'd have rushed us in force and wiped us out.
- Aye.
- That's true.
How about stalking out somewhere on foot, Sergeant?
With our rifles, and fighting it out tonight.
And leave the Corporal here alone?
How would you carry him without horses?
How would you carry enough water for a long march?
We've gotta stick here and take our chances of being relieved.
We've got water, we've got dates.
But first we've gotta see.
You think you can see everything in the desert, but you can't.
Hardly a thing out there.
We've gotta see for miles.
Sergeant, how about me climbing to the top of that palm tree and having a look?
I could see from there to Bloomsbury.
- That's it.
- Go on, Hale. I'll help you.
All right. Let's go.
That's a boy!
Come on, old boy.
Hey.
A little bit of how's-your-father.
Will you all mind?
Right. Coming up.
- See anything?
- Can't see what I'm looking for...
Molly's red hat on the dock.
Are you sure it's the red hat you're looking at?
If she has a friend with her, let me know, will you?
Half a mile. I see something.
It's moving.
Looks like the sun shining on a rifle barrel.
- Where?
- Right over there, behind that dune.
Right over there, in the shadow.
Look out! Clear!
Hale, Hale, Hale.
Right through the head.
See here, men.
There's a strip of paper in here for each one of us, except Sanders.
I'm leaving him out of it.
All right with you?
There's one of them longer than the others... and the man that gets it, picks his mate and slogs out for the river tonight.
It's our only chance.
We've gotta get help.
Anybody object to doing it that way?
No? All right.
Here they go.
Now, keep it as it is. Don't unroll it.
I'll draw the last.
Abelson.
Morelli.
All right, unroll them.
- It's up to you now, Cook.
- Aye.
Relieve Morelli.
Come on, choose your sidekick.
- Who would it be, but myself.
- No, no, Michael. You are too late.
If Matlow goes, I go with him.
- He'll need my knowledge of soldiering.
- What did you say about soldiering?
- Well, in my 25 years of service...
- And what about my 27?
Three of them in the guardroom.
The guardroom?
Boys, did you hear that?
The guardroom.
Listen, Jock, to your teeth, that's a dirty red lie.
Forget it, forget it.
Brown, flip a coin. You decide.
Have you got a shilling?
Oh.
Eenie, meenie, miney, mo, catch a boodoo by his toe... if he hollers, let him go, eenie, meenie, miney, mo.
Now, that settles it.
McKay, you go with Cook.
And you better get your gear together.
Take all the water bottles, except two.
You'll leave tonight when the moon is down.
Aye.
Oh... by the way... they might not...
There's a chance they might not get back in time.
Now what I mean to say is... if any of you fellows want to scribble a few lines...
I've no objection of
McKay taking them along.
Remember, Jock...
- keep to the north all the time.
- Right.
Head to the river and you'll find the brigade.
Here's some letters.
Morelli's, Quincannon's, Sanders'.
Here's mine.
I didn't know that, Sergeant.
You're a man to be envied.
- Thanks.
- Well, Matlow, here we go.
Goodbye to you, Sergeant.
We'll be sending along for you shortly.
We'll be looking for you.
- Say goodbye, Jock, old scout.
- Goodbye.
And have a couple of pints for me when you get there.
So long, Jock.
No sweating on the way.
- Good luck, Jock.
- I'll try, Michael.
- See you.
- Bye.
- How you feeling, Abelson?
- Oh, I'm all right.
Only it's so blooming hot...
I'm sweating worse than when the sun was up.
Want me to take your turn at sentry-go?
I'm not asking any favors.
I'll do my part.
Well, you'll be relieved pretty soon.
Keep your topi on, son.
- What's up?
- Abelson. Look.
Over and beyond Abelson.
See that moving there?
200 yards.
Blank fire and keep firing.
Hey!
He's moving.
Morelli! Come back, you fool.
Come back!
Morelli, you fool. Come back.
Come on, cover him up. Rapid fire.
You mustn't go. Don't go.
Sergeant. Sergeant! Corporal Bell!
Oh, Father.
Father of mercy.
Sergeant!
- What's up?
- Something moving out there.
Right back of that dune.
Turn out!
Horses.
Get ready.
Let them have it.
Wait, they're not Arabs.
They're our horses.
It's McKay and Cook.
Oh, look at their faces.
Oh, Jock. Jock, Matlow.
Quick, lend us a hand.
We gotta get them out of here.
The dirty, filthy swine.
I'll get one of you for this.
By the cross of Croagh Patrick, by the blood of the mother that bore me... you shall suffer.
I'll get you for this. I'll get...
- Quincannon! Come back!
- Come back, you fool!
- Come back, Quincannon!
- Bastards!
Morelli.
Morelli.
Morelli.
Did you see their faces?
McKay and Cook?
Their eyes and mouths... all choked up with...
Shall you ever forget it?
Oh, shut up, will you?
I'm trying to forget it, blast you!
I was dreaming, thinking I was back in Blighty.
And you wake me up.
That's what's going to happen to all of us.
Maybe, I'll be next... maybe you'll be next.
Why don't you prepare yourself?
Why don't you make your peace with God?
Because I don't have to. I'm all right.
I ain't done nothing to be ashamed of.
There's only been one in my life.
Shut up and let me sleep, will you?
Now, he's gone.
First, it was the Lieutenant... then it was Pearson.
Oh, suck it, will you?
What's the use of talking about it?
Then it was Hale...
Abelson...
Bell...
McKay, Cook...
Quincannon.
And now he's gone.
He said goodbye to me.
Then he disappeared.
What are you talking about?
You're not going the way they did.
They weren't prepared.
I'm going to save you, Morelli.
I know my mission now.
I'm going to make you believe.
Listen, Sanders,
I'll blow you to kingdom come.
I will, so help me. I'll splatter your brains against that wall.
- Now stay away and shut up, will you?
- Steady on, steady on.
Easy with that rifle, Morelli.
- What's up?
- He's crazy, Sergeant.
He ought to be tied up.
If you don't keep him away from me
I'll kill him, so help me, I will.
Morelli, get hold of yourself.
Sanders.
Sanders! Go wake up Brown.
Time I was relieved.
He's gone.
Gone?
- Who?
- Brown.
He went out of that door.
He said you'd understand.
What?
He wrote something in my Bible... for you.
Deserted?
Insubordinate swine.
Bilged out.
Left us like a rat, when we needed every man.
Why didn't you tell me?
You're a party to this, you know.
Get your rifle and get out of here.
You take his place.
Yes.
Yes, that's it.
That's it, Sergeant. Yes.
"Sorry, Sergeant...
"but Quincannon was right.
He marked off one for Jock.
"I'll get another for Matlow.
"Taking a long swing to come around behind them.
"Fine moon tonight.
Should be good hunting.
"Yours contritely, George Brown.
"PS:
"Not a good name...
"but the best I could think of when I enlisted."
- Have a smoke?
- How many you got?
Six. How many have you?
Four.
Not enough, ain't it, Sarge?
Have one of mine.
Sarge, did you ever hear tell the tale of Jonahs?
Yeah.
If only something would move out there.
This... waiting.
- About Jonahs. Listening?
- Yeah.
Well, I'm one of them.
Take that turn of mine before the war.
That was as good a dancing team as ever you saw, Sarge.
Morel and Moree, acrobatic dancers.
Morel was me, see. Moree was Jessie.
She was a good kid, Sarge.
And dance, oh...
She was a looker, too.
We wasn't exactly married... but if ever a guy got a wife that was too good for him... that's what happened to me when I hooked up with Jessie.
We sure was happy, too.
Well... knocking down good money, too.
We're growing so big, we're figuring on with topping the act.
So we stick in a slack wire dance for Jessie.
Just for a climax, you know?
It goes great.
The opening night, we knock them for a row.
We go around hugging each other.
Next night, the wire breaks.
They ring down the curtain to find me over her crying like a baby.
And Jessie's a-lying there, white as milk... biting her lips against the pain, trying to put on a smile... and comfort me.
Comfort me, mind you.
She wasn't killed...
'cause I'm a Jonah.
I guess you don't know what I mean, Sarge.
Guess nobody else does.
You're not bothered with no woman.
Never seen you look at one.
You never was married, like, was you, Sarge?
- Yes.
- Yeah?
That's funny.
I never heard you talk about it.
She died.
Kind of made me hate the kid at first.
Oh.
- That way, huh?
- Yeah.
Seemed to me the little beggar was to blame.
I didn't want him. I wanted her.
- Little blighters grow on you, though.
- I suppose so.
I'll never know.
Pretty soon, all I could think of was the kid.
Wanted him to have everything I'd missed.
Found myself working hard for promotion.
More pay. Saving every bob.
Cor, I had it all figured out.
Sent him to a good school.
Oh, he's a fine little fellow, Morelli.
You ought to see him.
That's what I've been fighting for.
What'll happen to him now, without me?
Oh, forget it.
- If only something would move out there.
- Don't worry.
- You ever had ambition?
- Yeah.
Jessie and me always wanted to play the Coliseum.
Well, I've had it bad in my time, but I've never had it like I've got it now.
Swine... hiding out there.
I'll get them.
I tell you, I'll get them, Morelli.
- And then I'll die.
- Easy, Sarge, don't you go that way.
Hey!
He sees us, Sarge!
He sees us!
Sanders, Sanders, look! See it?
Look!
You see that, Sanders?
We're all right now.
We're all right now.
- He's landing, Sarge.
- Morelli, Morelli, we're crazy.
Hello.
We mustn't do it.
If he goes walking across there...
- Hey, get back! Get back!
- I never thought of that, Sarge.
Get away!
- Don't do it! Turn back!
- Get away!
- Don't do it!
- Turn around!
- Go on!
- Don't do it.
- Get away!
- Hey!
I say...
I say, you chaps should...
You did that! You've killed him!
He came in answer to my prayers, for me... and you killed him, you murdered him!
Tie him up, Morelli.
Tie him up before I kill him.
Look at it out there, mocking us.
What good does it do us?
Better if it wasn't there.
- Ever been up in one, Sarge?
- No.
Let's do something.
I can't stand this.
- Let's take a whack at it.
- Good idea.
- You know how to start it?
- No.
I don't know one jigger from the other.
All I know is horses.
- Sarge.
- Yeah?
I'm thinking... if we'd have rushed them, right off, the minute we got here...
What's the use of chewing the rag about something we might have done?
Right you are, Sarge.
Yeah, I know what you're thinking!
Perhaps I've done everything wrong.
Perhaps this, and perhaps that.
But what I've done, I've done!
And what I haven't, I haven't!
Sorry, Morelli.
Shouldn't fly off like that.
- I'm getting jumpy.
- That's all right, Sarge.
- Forget it. My fault.
- No, it's mine... because I...
Well, I blew up like that because...
Well, I've done all the thinking in this outfit.
Had to meet everything that came along.
My head was twisted silly, thinking.
- Good job you was with us.
- Thanks.
But the thing that gets me most... is being done in by them sneaking Arabs.
What does the war mean to them?
Might just as well be friendly.
Some are, some ain't.
- They'll get us all right.
- Yeah, but we'll get them, too, see.
That's all I want now.
That's the only idea I've got in here.
See, I'm thinking, Morelli.
That's all I've been doing.
All day and all night.
Thinking, thinking.
I've got an idea.
We're going out there, you and me.
Try and start it?
Don't be crazy. I said an idea.
I'll leave this behind.
- You stay here and cover me.
- Wait a minute, Sarge...
- I'll go along with you.
- You stay here.
No, Sarge.
I can tell you, I'm scared... scared of being alone, the last man, no one to talk to.
I'd go bug-house like him.
I couldn't stand it.
All right.
Leave it here. Come along.
- Leave it?
- Yes, I said leave it.
Come on.
Halt!
Sergeant Clegg.
What do you make that out to be?
Fire of some sort, sir.
How far do you think?
Five or six hours, sir.
Forward march!
Sergeant! Sergeant!
I thought I saw something moving out there!
Couldn't have been though, huh?
I'm getting jumpy.
No. No, it ain't that, Sarge.
I'm scared. Scared of being alone.
Scared to be the last man,
I gotta talk to somebody!
Well, we're alone now.
He's gone.
- Sanders?
- Yes.
Morelli, look!
Sanders, come on back here! Sanders!
Morelli!
Sanders, don't stick your head up there!
Sanders, what's wrong with you?
Morelli, come back! Let him go!
Stop walking, will you!
Come on, you swine!
Come and get me now!
Come and get me! Come on. Come on.
Come on, you swine!
Come on! Come on!
Quincannon, I got them!
Quincannon, Brown!
There they are! I got them!
Morelli, Pearson! Pearson, Morelli!
McKay, look! Look at them! l...
Full halt!
Been looking for you, Sergeant.
Where are your men?
Speak up, man. Where's your section?
English
That's enough, Charlie.
What'd he do that last mile in, Doc?
You didn't seen any jackrabbits pass him, did you?
Maybe we should've sent him to the Olympic Games instead of his son Lee.
- Yeah.
- If son Lee win 100-meter swimming race... chest expand two inches more.
Well, as long as it's your chest and not your waistline, it's all right.
Show him how you can touch the floor with your fingers, Charlie.
- [Strains]
- [Laughing] That's enough.
Well, you're all right until next year's physical examination, Charlie.
You won't be retired this year.
Hello. Who's going fishing?
Charlie. I'm lending him my tackle.
Do you know what this is?
Sure. That's a Waikiki spinner.
Say, that's a beauty, eh?
But he'll need a good heavy line with that.
What do you think he's going fishing for- whales? He needs a light silk line.
Oh, you're talking through your hat.
What-What line do you prefer, Charlie?
Oh, just piece of string with hook on one end, optimist on other.
[Laughs]
A good combination at that.
But honorable chief recommend latest scientific implement... to catch unwary fish.
Well, good luck to you.
But I know you'll get 'em... even if you have to bring 'em in with handcuffs.
Thank you so much, but this time "fish-hunt," not manhunt.
- [All Laughing]
- Well, good-bye, boys.
Good-bye.
Hey, Pop!
Oh, excuse me. I thought my pop was alone.
How do you do, Mr. Scott?
Well, son, what are you all steamed up about?
Junior son Charlie most anxious to start on fishing trip.
Yeah, and I bought a book on how to catch 'em- The Fisherman's Guide.
Good idea.
If don't catch fish... book provide excellent fish story.
Ah, we'll catch 'em all right.
Gee, that's swell tackle!
Look at it sparkle.
Good fisherman, like clever merchant, know lure of bright colors.
But suppose the fish are color-blind?
[Laughs]
Answer that, Charlie.
Well, in that case, perhaps guidebook give address of good fish market.
But anyone could tell a store fish... because it hasn't got the marks of a barbed hook in its mouth.
Fear number two son, like older brother Lee... develop symptoms of detective.
Ah, I can beat Lee at detecting right now.
- [Airplane Droning]
- Gee, look at that big new plane up there!
That's the Hopkins ship. They're making a test flight for the government... demonstrating a new way of handling a plane by remote radio control.
Oh, I know.
Like they do with battleships... so they can send them out to fight without any men on board.
Would be greatest blessing... if all war fought with machinery instead of human beings.
Hello. Hello.
3,000 altitude.
Shall I switch over to radio control?
No. Wait for instructions.
I believe, Colonel, if we keep the plane in sight of the field in the preliminary test... it'll be better for observation.
That's a good idea, Mr. Cartwright.
Unfortunately, Masters, my regular test pilot, injured his shoulder.
We had to substitute Edwards, and he's not so familiar with the robot.
What is the operating radius of the device, Mr. Hopkins?
That's undetermined.
In previous inventions... transmission of the radio control wave was affected by static.
But in Mr. Cartwright's device, we've successfully overcome that.
We can direct a plane over a charted course as long as the motors function.
Well, it sounds all right.
That's why I'm putting all my resources back of it, Commander. I believe in it.
I know what a powerful weapon it would be in the hands of an enemy.
- That's why I want our government to control it.
- Are you ready, Mr. Cartwright?
Ready. Hello? Hello,
Edwards. Switch over.
Okay.
She's on, sir.
The plane is now under radio control from the board here.
Have you any special test in mind, Colonel?
- Take her to 6,000 feet and bank while climbing.
- Yes, sir.
Look at that plane climb!
It's probably under radio control now.
Remarkable achievement of science- body perform work while brain detached.
I'm sure glad you can't go fishing by radio.
Huh? Gentle hint. Come on.
[Cartwright On Radio]
Hello? Hello, Edwards. How's she riding?
[Edwards]
Smooth as silk, Mr. Cartwright.
There's a strong wind drift from the south, but stabilization is perfect.
Why, Dick, what are you doing here?
I've been watching that plane because
I thought you were up there flying it.
No. I knocked my shoulder out this morning.
I didn't want to risk anything going wrong in the test, so I bowed out.
- But everything will go off all right, I guess.
- Well, I hope so.
Hello, Edwards.
Watch yourself. Power dive.
Okay, let her go.
That's good enough for me.
Pull her up.
Cartwright, she's heading out to sea.
Bring her back.
- She's out of my control!
- The plane isn't out of the pilot's control.
- Order Edwards to return!
- Hello, hello, Edwards!
Edwards! Hello!
The phone's dead.
He's deliberately making off with the plane.
Get out another ship and take after him.
[Phone Ringing]
Hello. This is Mr. Hughes.
Oh, Pan American Airways.
Yes, I'll use my reservation on tomorrow's Clipper for San Francisco.
Thank you.
Calling all United States and commercial craft in Hawaiian waters.
Watch for monoplane, number NC203R.
Report immediately any information to Pearl Harbor Naval Base.
News flash! No trace yet of the plane which vanished mysteriously 48 hours ago.
Were plane and pilot swallowed by the sea?
Or is their disappearance a part of a daring spy plot?
Government agencies are making every effort to solve the riddle...
and expect to have an answer at any moment.
- More later.
- Gee, Pop... they're having as hard a time finding that plane as we are catching fish.
Fish in sea like flea on dog- always present but difficult to catch.
Maybe we'll have better luck here.
I'll take a look around.
Hey, Pop, come here quick!
Hurry up!
Hurry up!
Right down there. Look.
[Chan]
"NC203R."
Undoubtedly the missing plane.
Run to nearest telephone and notify authorities.
Okay, Pop.
Get a shot over there.
Stand out of the way.
Hey, kids, get down from there.
Will you come in a minute, gentlemen?
There's our answer- deliberate theft.
The ordinary mechanism is intact... but the most important part of the device is missing.
And so is the pilot.
Yes, with an invention any foreign power would pay millions to get.
Instrument could be duplicated without aid of original plan?
Easily- by taking it apart and copying it.
Edwards knew that.
That's why he stole it.
Well, he certainly took a long chance setting the plane down on the edge of the water.
Oh, no, he didn't. Tell him what you found in my fisherman's guidebook, Pop.
Fisherman's guidebook show lowest tide of season... was Tuesday at 11:00 a.m.
Halfhour earlier same day, plane disappear from Honolulu.
With tide out, hard sand beach... make excellent landing field.
But unless there was an accident in landing, how do you account for the fire?
Evidence that device was carefully removed... prove fire started later.
Pilot Edwards wear flying suit while testing plane?
[Hopkins]
No, just flannel shirt and trousers.
Here, Pop!
Tell him about this zipper we found.
Long zipper of type used on flying suit... suggest that plane have other passenger besides test pilot Edwards.
That's impossible. The plane was inspected before it left the field.
No one besides Edwards could've been aboard.
I'm no detective, but it's apparent to me... the pilot stole the device and tried to burn the plane to cover the theft.
He's right.
The man we want is Edwards.
In nearby lagoon have already located murdered body... of unfortunate pilot Edwards.
Gee, Pop, you never told me that!
The idea is ridiculous. No one could possibly have hidden aboard the plane.
I inspected it myself just before it took off.
There you are, Charlie.
- How soon before, please?
- Not more than five minutes.
- Any workmen in vicinity?
- A few.
Possible, then, for man to hide in plane after inspection?
Yes, it would be.
But I'll soon find out.
I'll check every man that was on the field at the time.
- Would you like to question them yourself, Mr. Chan?
- Not necessary.
May examine time cards, please?
Certainly.
I'm at a loss to understand this.
All our mechanics are brought here from the
Mainland. They're old and trusted employees.
Were they all here on the morning of the test?
[Hopkins] No, only the ground crew.
The installation was complete...
and I gave the shop force the day off.
Most strange.
- What is it, Charlie?
- Note.
Stamp of Monday night on time cards, light ink.
But stamp ofTuesday morning in heavy ink.
Well, there's nothing strange about that.
The timekeeper must've changed the ribbon.
Quite correct. But notice peculiar circumstance.
Here is card of one man who finish work on Monday night... yet stamped with heavy ink ofTuesday.
So it is. That proves this fellow stamped his card Tuesday, or somebody did it for him.
Also could establish alibi for man who remain on field Monday night... to conceal self in test plane.
- Whose card is that?
- Name: Miller.
Address: Tropic Hotel.
You're sure Miller didn't sleep here Monday night?
I know he didn't.
But he was here Tuesday... and that's the last
I've heard from him.
Disturb nothing, please.
Mr. Miller have lady visitor Tuesday evening?
I should say not! I don't stand for carrying-on in my house.
Very commendable precaution.
But observe.
Hairs from white fox fur... indicate fashionable lady visitor sit here... while talking with someone opposite.
Well, no woman came in here without me knowing it.
Evident bird of fine plumage escape sharp eye of eagle.
You say you saw Miller on Tuesday night?
Didn't say I saw him, but I know he was in.
I put a telephone call through for him to the Royal Hawaiian Hotel about 8:00.
- Who was call to?
- I don't listen in on my guests' telephone conversations.
Unfortunate not to break rule on this occasion.
Anyone connected with the aviation company live at the Royal Hawaiian?
I do, Cartwright does, and so does Masters.
Masters? Isn't that the pilot who was supposed to fly the test?
Yes.
Presence of wine glasses... suggest hospitality offered to lady of white fox fur.
But not used.
And no wine visible.
I don't allow drinking either.
Excellent reason to conceal forbidden fruit.
Perhaps in closet.
- [Screams]
- Miller!
Unfortunately dead.
And that telephone call to the Royal Hawaiian... involves either Hopkins,
Cartwright or Masters.
What about the gal- the one with the white fox fur?
One more crack, and very bright junior son walk home.
Excuse me, Pop.
Well, whoever murdered Miller stole the invention to peddle to some foreign government.
Quite correct. But Honolulu make very poor market.
We'll check every ship that's put out of here since 8:00 Tuesday night.
Perhaps murderer make more speedy exit- use flying ship to reach Mainland.
The Clipper left here
Wednesday at 2:00... the day after the device was stolen.
- Pan American office.
- Okay, Chief.
Here's the passenger list.
Richard Masters!
- Is that the Masters connected with Hopkins Aviation Company?
- Yes, it is.
Recall if Mr. Masters arrive at dock alone?
No, he came in our car from the Royal Hawaiian Hotel with a lady.
Notice only one lady on passenger list-
Miss Yvonne Roland.
- Wear white fox fur?
- Yes, she did.
Police headquarters. It may not be too late to check on them at the other end.
Hello. Chief Scott speaking.
Contact San Francisco Police...
and ask for a tracer on Richard Masters and Yvonne Roland.
Arrived on yesterday's Clipper.
Hey, Pop! White fox fur.
Now positively walk home.
There's nothing suspicious about Masters leaving on the Clipper.
He's a member of the American Olympic team.
He had to fly back in time to make his boat from New York to Germany.
Well, that seems to alibi Masters.
Then the call Miller made to the
Royal Hawaiian at 8:00 Tuesday night... must have been to the woman.
- But 8:00 Tuesday night Miller called me.
- What about?
His return ticket to Los Angeles.
Our workmen are leaving tomorrow. I asked
Mr. Hopkins to send the ticket to his hotel.
Quite correct. Found same in Mr. Miller's mailbox.
Here. Look at this passenger list.
See if you recognize any of these names.
Yes, here's one. Now I know who's guilty of these crimes.
- Who?
- Arthur Hughes.
He's a notorious filibuster who's made a fortune selling arms... to revolutionists in every part of the world.
From the time I had Cartwright's invention, he's been after me to sell it.
If I'd known he'd followed me to Honolulu...
I'd have suspected him at once.
Charlie, see if you can get any information on this fellow Hughes.
Have already investigated all passengers on Clipper.
For past two weeks, Mr. Hughes guest at Royal Hawaiian Hotel.
[Chief]
That's funny, Mr. Hopkins.
You both have been at the same hotel, yet you didn't know he was in Honolulu.
- Whether you believe it or not, I didn't.
- Excuse, please.
Truth, like football, receive many kicks before reaching goal.
Wouldn't it be advisable to trace Hughes immediately?
That's up to Mr. Scott.
We're leaving on tomorrow's Clipper... and I'll put the matter in the hands of the San Francisco Police.
Coming, Cartwright?
Thank you, gentlemen, for the help you've given us.
I'm not so sure the guilty man isn't walking out right now.
His story about Hughes was altogether too pat.
K.G.P.D. Coming in.
- Hello?
- San Francisco on the air, Chief.
Send it through.
[Man On Speaker]
San Francisco Police... reporting tracer on Richard Masters and Yvonne Roland.
Both left Oakland Airport
9:30 Thursday morning... on transcontinental plane for New York.
Regarding later request on Arthur Hughes... this passenger removed to emergency hospital under influence of powerful drug.
Recovered sufficiently to leave hospital in two hours.
Destination as yet unknown.
That is all.
How did that Hughes information happen to come through?
Took liberty of requesting same.
[Man On Intercom]
Yes, sir?
Contact New York for follow-up on Masters and the Roland woman. Get a tracer on Hughes.
Mr. Hughes now become mysterious needle in hay pile.
Honolulu calling
San Francisco Police.
A follow-up on that Clipper tracer-
Mr. Scott, did you get anything on-
Lady of white fox fur?
That is purpose of visit?
No, sir. I brought you down a pot of tea and some sandwiches.
Oh.
Consideration for paternal stomach most unusual.
Yeah. You know, I've been thinking it over, and I've got a theory.
Oh, you have theory?
Suggest you go home, sleep on same.
Meanwhile advise honorable mother... am waiting for important message from New York.
Okay, Pop.
But I'll bet it's the gal with the white fox fur.
[Both Laughing]
Yes? Here comes the dope on that Honolulu tracer.
Get ready to pass it on to San Francisco.
Yes? They're on the steamship Manhattan.
Your work must be intensely interesting.
You know, shortwave radios always fascinated me.
- Oh, really?
- We get excellent reception in Honolulu.
Oh, I pick up the Islands on the shortwave sometimes.
Well, I wonder-
But you're so busy.
Oh, no, not at all. In fact-
Well, l-I mean, not right now anyway.
Come on in, and I'll see if I can get something for you.
- Two minutes of 9:00.
- [Intercom Buzzes]
[Man]
San Francisco coming in.
San Francisco Police reporting tracer from New York on Masters and Roland.
Here's something now.
San Francisco Police talking to Honolulu.
[Man] Both sailed on steamship
Manhattan for Berlin.
Boat left New York 11:00 tonight.
Regarding other inquiry-Arthur Hughes had reservation on same vessel but missed sailing.
Followed in tug to Sandy Hook and boarded ship there.
That is all.
Oh, that was marvelous. Just as clear as we get it at home. Thank you.
Oh, that's all right, Miss Roland.
It's a pleasure.
- Ah, you're so nice. Good night.
- Good night.
Come in again.
Hughes, Yvonne Roland and Masters-
all on the steamship Manhattan.
Say, that's the boat your son Lee's on... the one that's taking the American Olympic team to Berlin.
The same. Berlin now attract many foreign visitors.
Offer excellent opportunity for spies of all countries to operate without suspicion.
That's the very place the thief could easily dispose of the robot.
Charlie, Lee is going to meet his pop in Berlin.
Well, aren't you surprised?
Suspected same.
Have already sent note in tea basket... for honorable wife to pack traveling bag.
Well, they've got a big start on you.
Their boat docks in Hamburg in seven days.
Race not always won by man who start first.
Please.
Will leave tomorrow in company with Hopkins and Cartwright on Clipper.
Honolulu-
18 hours to Mainland.
Then transcontinental plane from San Francisco.
Thirteen hours across country to New York.
Take Zeppelin Hindenberg from Lakehurst, New Jersey... across Atlantic Ocean to Friedrichshafen, 61 hours.
It's fortunate we haven't been delayed.
We'll be on the dock in Hamburg when the Manhattan arrives.
I still think we should have radioed the steamship to have their baggage searched.
Good hunter never warn tiger of trap.
Oh, observe below- steamship Manhattan.
- Boy, is that some sausage!
- Say, that thing really travels fast too!
- How many people does it carry?
- How should I know?
Gee, would I like a ride in that!
[Woman]
Why didn't they send us over in it?
There's no second class on an airship.
- [All Laughing]
- Oh, excuse me, Betty.
- Oh, that's all right, Lee.
- As my pop would say...
"Man who stretch neck looking up very apt to break neck falling down."
- Have you seen Dick Masters?
- Well, l- Oh, he must be somewhere around.
Now, don't try to cover up. I know.
He's with Miss Roland, isn't he?
Now, Betty, don't you worry about that.
Oh, I'm not.
Don't think I'm jealous.
Only... I'd like to throw that slinky brunette overboard.
I wouldn't have said anything if you hadn't mentioned it, Betty... but I've got a theory about that woman.
She's an adventuress.
- What?
- Shh. Come over here.
You know, I'm a pretty good detective, and I observe things.
Well, there's another fellow on the boat watches everything she does... especially when she's with Dick.
- What for?
- Well, I have a theory on that too.
As my pop would say, "When a woman play with fire, man get burned."
Or something like that.
[Laughing]
Well, what are you two conspiring about?
Oh, hello, Dick.
Fancy meeting you here.
- Hadn't you noticed I was on the boat?
- Occasionally.
I suppose I have been monopolizing Dick's company... but I am so interested in all you athletes.
Radiogram for you, Miss Roland.
Oh, thank you.
Will you excuse me?
Would you mind posing for a photo, Mr. Masters?
I am so interested in all you big athletes.
- Aw!
- [Squeals]
- [Groaning]
- Oh, that's swell. Hold it.
- Say, let me carry that for you.
- Go on!
Say, Betty, how's chances taking our picture?
Come on, gang.
Let's all get in on it.
[Man] Hey, Charlie. Come on, Francis.
You want your picture taken?
[Chattering Continues]
[Laughing]
Oh, let me have a picture of all of you.
- Really, I'd rather-
- Oh, please. I'd love to have one. Go on.
[Man]
Get off of my leg. Come on, guys.
Come on, Betty.
[Squeals]
Back a little further, please.
I'll fix it for you. How's that?
[Chattering Continues]
I'll be right back.
So sorry.
[Speaking Chinese]
- Thanks, Betty.
- I'll have the films developed for you this afternoon.
- Oh, never mind. I'll do it.
- But I want some extra prints.
It'll be no trouble, really.
I'll see you later, Dick.
Well, we'd better clean up for lunch.
Am I having lunch with you and Miss Roland?
- No, you're lunching with me alone, you pest.
- Oh!
Meet you in five minutes.
Psst. Betty.
I was right.
She is an adventuress.
She has a husband.
Look.
Where did you get this?
That fellow Hughes swiped it out of her book, and I got it from him.
I'll bet he's her husband's private detective getting evidence for a divorce.
If she gets Dick in trouble,
I'll tear her apart.
- I think I'll do it right now.
- Wait a minute, Betty.
As my pop would say, "Sugar catch more flies than hamburger steak."
[Laughs]
Or something like that.
But you stick with them. Don't leave
Dick alone with her for a second.
That Roland gal is going to think
I'm her Siamese twin.
- And leave everything else to me.
- Right.
Most excellent view of stadium for Olympic Games.
Very interesting. But I'm more concerned with the business that brought us here.
Useless to sprinkle salt on tail of time.
Must wait until
Manhattan dock tomorrow.
[Steam Whistle Blowing]
We received your radio at sea last night, Inspector Strasser.
No one has yet gone ashore.
The three passengers you mentioned have been carefully watched.
- Has any baggage been taken ashore?
- Nothing yet, sir.
Mr. Cartwright is standing by in Customs to identify the device.
Exactly. You see, Mr. Chan,
German methods are very thorough.
Have greatest admiration for well-known efficiency.
Suggest we interview
Miss Roland immediately.
Yes, sir.
- Miss Roland in her room?
- Yes, sir.
[Knocking]
[Knocking]
Recommend use of key.
It looks as though the Roland woman met the same fate as Miller.
It is forbidden to touch anything.
Shut the door.
When was lady last seen?
When she came from the deck to her stateroom shortly before midnight.
The steward has been on guard ever since.
- Anyone visit room?
- No, sir.
No one has come in or out since I've been on duty.
Then someone was waiting here when she entered.
- Did you hear any unusual noise?
- No, sir.
Then he must have made very short work of her.
And this is probably the weapon he used.
The dent was caused by a heavy blow.
And that clock establishes the time when the crime was committed- at precisely 17 minutes after 12:00.
Excuse me, sir. I was near the door then, and I didn't hear anything.
You were probably asleep.
That's enough. You can go.
- May examine, please?
- Certainly.
What was the location of the ship at 17 minutes after 12:00?
About 20 miles off the mouth of the Elbe River.
We were proceeding slowly in a heavy fog.
Exactly. Conditions were perfect for the murderer to dispose of the body.
You see?
The porthole is still open.
He then searched the room, found the stolen object... and escaped without detection.
- A perfect reconstruction, Inspector Strasser.
- [Clicks Heels]
- Exactly.
- [Knocking]
Oh, I beg your pardon.
- I thought this was Miss Roland's cabin.
- Hughes!
Well, this is a surprise.
I never expected to meet you here, Hopkins.
There's the man we want.
The woman was his accomplice.
When he thought they had the device safely in Germany, he murdered her as he did Miller.
That's a very neat plot. It suggests an author's perfect knowledge of events.
When were you in this stateroom last?
I'm sorry, but I've never enjoyed the privilege of Miss Roland's intimate company.
Then explain, please, importance of recovering cigarette lighter from table.
Oh, I did that rather awkwardly, didn't I?
But I'm sure I can explain it.
I was on deck last night with Miss Roland.
I offered my lighter for her cigarette.
She failed to return it.
- I dropped in to pick it up.
- Well, you must think we're all fools.
I'm not acquainted with the other gentlemen.
I demand his arrest!
Pardon, please.
No occasion for arrest.
What do you mean?
Sorry to explode theory of brother officer... but no evidence of murder here.
One moment, please.
Observe.
Dent in water carafe... fit round knob on post of bed... so.
Note, please, varnish chipped on same.
Exactly!
Also took liberty to examine fingerprints on neck of bottle.
Match lady's fingerprint on glass top of dresser perfectly.
Mr. Chan, this is extraordinary.
But I have the solution.
The woman arranged all this herself... so she could get ashore with the stolen device and escape pursuit.
Congratulations, Herr Inspector.
We'll have her in custody in 24 hours.
Well, since you have no further need for me, I'll-
No, you don't. I want this fellow's baggage searched.
You're overplaying your hand,
Hopkins.
- But if the police wish it, I shan't object.
- Exactly.
And I'll arrange for the release of the other passengers and baggage.
Can join you on dock later?
Hello.
Pop! Gee!
What are you doing here?
Please explain first most unceremonious entrance.
I was going to make an investigation here.
I came over the rail so no one could see me.
- Still playing tricks of detective?
- Yeah, I'm hot on a case.
The woman who has this cabin is an adventuress, and she's got a husband... and he's got a private detective named Hughes on this boat watching her.
Now she's trying to hook Dick Masters.
And Betty- that's Dick's sweetheart- is all upset about it.
I said I'd straighten it out.
Suspect recent activities of swimming caused water on brain.
No, sirree. I tell you, this is the real thing.
There isn't a murder yet, but I'm sure glad you're here.
You can help me. Take a look at this radiogram her husband sent her.
Hey, what's happened here?
Object of hot case make mysterious disappearance.
Don't worry, Pop.
With you helping me, I'll find her.
Look! Here's a swell clue!
Her white fox fur!
Have heard enough of white fox fur.
Gee, Pop, why didn't you radio me what was going on?
- I could've had the case closed by the time you got here.
- Modesty most commendable.
Well, you and I could've handled it better than that foreign cop.
All Strasser is doing is sitting back there and getting Hopkins's and Cartwright's life story.
- At least we got a clue.
- White fox fur?
No. That radiogram.
Only thing I can't figure out is where the husband fits in.
Suspect husband, like toupee on bald head... used for cover-up.
Message really very simple. Observe.
Read every fourth word.
"Your followed.
Boat waiting. Cuxhaven. "
Cuxhaven! That must be where she went overboard... and her pals had a boat waiting to pick her up.
And she got away with the invention.
Most improbable lady would risk injury to delicate device... by bath in salt water.
But what could she do with it?
Perhaps accomplice smuggle same ashore.
Well, it wasn't Dick Masters, because
Strasser searched everything he had.
Lady have contact with other athletes?
No. Only Betty Adams, and-
Say, I got it!
She borrowed Betty's camera, and she didn't give it back till last night.
Maybe she hid it in there and Betty carried it ashore.
- Possible.
- But Betty's on a special train ahead of us.
Say, Pop, we gotta do something.
- If Betty has it, those crooks'll be after her.
- [Knocking]
Come in, please.
Excuse me, Mr. Chan.
I dropped in to thank you... for helping me out of that situation this morning.
Very happy to be of service.
But situation in your favor that time.
That's fair enough.
- Sit down, please.
- Thank you.
I'd like to repay you by giving you a tip.
You'll be much safer if you spend your time in Berlin enjoying the Olympic Games.
All play and no work make Charlie Chan very dull policeman.
I wonder if you've been smart enough to figure out who killed Miller.
Perhaps you... have answer.
I think in the final showdown, you'll ask Mr. Hopkins.
Well, I must be going.
[Gunshot]
I got him, Pop! Help me!
Please to release too active number one son.
Well, you must pardon my rough tactics... but I saw a rifle barrel in the car driving on the road beside us.
Now humble turn of Charlie Chan to be grateful.
Thank you so much.
When we meet again, we'll start even?
- [Door Closes]
- Say, that guy's too smart.
He timed the shot almost to a second.
But I'm awfully glad he pushed you out of the way of that bullet.
Humble parent seem to have fortunate fate of cat with nine lives.
I just want you to keep the one you have now.
And I'm sticking with you to see that nothing happens.
Correction, please. Will personally deliver you to Uncle Sam at Olympic Village.
- But, Pop-
- Also have desire to interview
Miss Betty Adams... to learn if she used camera for picture-taking this morning.
Gee, that's right. If she did, she discovered the invention in there.
Now reveal intelligent mind of good detective.
Thanks, Pop. We sure make a swell team, don't we?
Hmm.
[Crowd Cheering]
[Excited Chattering]
So this is Berlin.
- I've never seen so many bicycles in my life!
- Shucks, what a reception!
Hey, someone swiped my camera!
- How do you say stop in German?
- Hey, "stoppa" the bus!
- Arrestez-vous!
- Halta la machina!
- It's empty.
- I should've known better.
Gosh, I wanted that camera to get some pictures of the Games.
Gee, this isn't so bad.
I think I'll take that bed by the window.
Say, I wonder how you ask for a shampoo and a finger wave in German.
[Laughs] I wonder how you ask for something to eat.
It would be better if you girls would see the head matron now... to arrange for your seats in the dining hall.
That's me. I'm starved.
- I could eat a 16-pound shot.
- Well, come on.
- Let's all sit together.
- I wonder where that sauerkraut emporium is.
[Door Opening]
[Chan]
One moment, please.
May examine contents of basket?
It is nothing.
The girl athletes are forbidden candy.
I have taken it to report to the matron.
Would be most happy to save you trouble.
Hand it over!
Will identify, please.
- That's it!
- At last!
And it hasn't been tampered with.
It's been a long trail, Mr. Chan.
Last step ease toil of most difficult journey.
I'll take it.
Recommend immediate delivery to American Consul.
Life in danger while device in your possession.
Well, that's a chance
I'll have to take.
My responsibility's greater now than at home. I'll take charge of it.
- Come away from that window!
- [Maid] Look out! The police are here!
Who was in that car?
Take her away.
We'll find out who her accomplices are.
[Cartwright]
I should think that's obvious.
The Roland woman was associated with Masters, and the device was in his sweetheart's luggage.
[Hopkins] I'll report this to the American
Olympic Committee at once!
- [Strasser] Do you know this Masters?
- Certainly. He worked for me.
Mr. Chan?
Your son Lee told me you were here searching my luggage for some stolen invention.
Yes, and we found it.
- What?
- Excuse, please.
Miss Roland visit your room last night on boat to return camera?
Yes, she did. I was packing, and she insisted on helping me.
I suppose she hid the robot in your baggage without your knowing anything about it.
If that's where you found it, she must have.
You needn't look at me like that. I'm telling the truth.
I think you're trying to protect Masters.
The authorities will settle that.
You won't need the authorities.
Dick'll settle it himself.
Perhaps we've been a little hasty.
Hasty accusation like long shot on horse race.
Odds good, but chances doubtful.
Very obvious now why
Miss Roland borrow camera- give her excuse to visit stateroom... and conceal candy box with device in Miss Betty's luggage.
She certainly knew what she was doing.
The customs officials hardly looked at the luggage of the Olympic athletes.
When I get that matron down to headquarters, she'll tell where the Roland woman is.
Very commendable, but must not forget immediate danger.
Power behind Miss Roland will lose no time in attempt to regain most valuable robot.
Exactly.
And while you remain in Berlin, I'll see to your police protection, Mr. Hopkins.
- Excellent idea, Inspector.
- All right, gentlemen.
I'll drive you to your hotel.
Excuse, please.
Prefer to remain at Olympic Village... for visit with son Lee.
- May use telephone, please?
- Certainly.
- Thank you so much.
- [Clicks Heels]
[Door Closes]
Sure. Mr. Romeo, lady-killer. Just because that banjo-eyed brunette looks at you...
- you go for her like you're trying to break a world record.
- Forget it, will ya, Betty?
How did I know what was going on?
I only tried to be nice.
You were. You couldn't have been any sweeter if you'd given her a hacksaw to get out of jail.
And if Hopkins goes on making cracks, that's just where we'll be.
Well, I told you
I'd take care of all that.
- Then you'd better hurry up and see the police about it.
- All right. I will.
- But first I'm gonna settle with Hopkins.
- Dick! Dick, come back!
- Oh, ya big mug!
- What's the matter?
Oh, that poor goof. I told him what Hopkins said, and now he's going to knock his block off.
- That's swell! And he can do it.
- Oh, shut up.
I didn't mean that, Lee.
But don't you see?
If Dick gets into trouble, they'll suspend him from the team.
Gee, that's right. And as my pop would say,
"Don't rub sore finger with sandpaper."
- Oh, we have to stop him!
- We will, if I have to sock Hopkins myself.
Come on!
Might have been safer to leave the device in the hotel vault overnight.
I'm not trusting anybody.
If I'd know when I invented the mechanism... that it was gonna turn into a Frankenstein,
I'd have destroyed it.
Well, it's over now. We'll be safely on our way back to America in 24 hours.
I hope so. Well, I'll go wash up for dinner.
[Door Closes]
- Don't do it, Hopkins.
- What do you want?
Guess.
[Engine Stops]
- Is that their room on the second floor?
- Yes. He should be there now.
Keep your eye on that window. Be ready to make a fast getaway when he comes out.
I'll be in the lobby.
- Mr. Chan, I want your advice.
- Yes?
I heard an argument in Mr. Hopkins's room, and I was about to go in... when Mr. Hopkins himself let a man out.
- Who, please?
- That's it- I don't know.
Nobody has entered since I've been here, and
I arrived with Mr. Hopkins and Mr. Cartwright.
Most mysterious.
Perhaps wise to investigate.
[Gunshot]
Assistance, please.
[Batters On Door]
It was Hopkins. He escaped through the window. He's got my invention!
- Notify Inspector Strasser immediately.
- Yes, sir.
[Cartwright]
I hadjust left Hopkins alone...
so when I heard voices in here, I hurried in.
Hughes was accusing Hopkins of deliberately double-crossing his stockholders... by stealing my invention to sell it to a foreign government.
One moment.
Will corroborate?
- That's quite true.
- Continue, please.
They quieted down after I came in, but Hughes...
threatened to expose Hopkins ifhe didn't cut him in.
After Hughes left,
I asked Hopkins for an explanation.
He ignored me, went over to the desk and started to pack the device in a handbag.
I tried to stop him, and he drew a gun.
I grabbed for it. He tried to shoot me.
In the struggle I was hit on the head.
[Officer]
You can't go in there. It's forbidden!
Forbidden, my eye! I'm workin' on this case. I'm Chan and Son.
- Hello, Pop. I got some valuable information.
- Go ahead.
As Betty and I drove up, we saw a man drop out of that window into the garden.
Two guys helped him.
They started for a car. I went after them.
One of the guys slugged me.
They got away.
That settles it. Hopkins will be apprehended immediately.
In Berlin, things like this cannot happen.
No. By this time he's probably disposed of the device and is on his way out of town.
What's your connection with the Cartwright invention?
I tried to buy it from Hopkins, but he wouldn't do business.
Then when it was stolen in Honolulu...
I figured that Yvonne Roland had it, so I followed her.
But flying into San Francisco, she outsmarted me.
I caught up with her again on the Manhattan, but I didn't get anywhere.
She stuck too close to her friend Masters.
Wait a minute.
Look here, Mr. Chan.
I didn't have anything to do with this.
That's why I came here tonight- to make Hopkins take back what he said about Betty and me.
I suppose the reason you didn't come up here right away was... because you had a date in the lobby with Yvonne Roland.
- Yvonne Roland? In this hotel?
- Dick, is that true?
- Well, l-
- Oh!
- Hey, Betty.
- Wait! Give explanations to the police.
All right. I did see her, but I didn't have any date with her.
Just as I came in she was standing in the lobby. I started after her.
I wanted her to face Hopkins to help clear me.
Well, she ducked into the florist's shop,
I followed, but she got away.
Then I came up here. And now I'll take care of you for making that crack in front of Betty.
[Whistle Tweeting]
- Take them out of here.
- [Dick Straining]
[Officer]
Get out. Get- Get out of here.
- Mr. Chan, I apologize. It's impossible.
- [Door Closes]
- Things like this cannot happen in Berlin.
- [Clicks Heels]
[No Audible Dialogue]
- You were successful?
- Yes, Your Excellency.
- I received it directly from his hands.
- Very good.
Examine it, Carlos.
I hope you have the draft for the price agreed upon, Your Excellency.
You will receive it as soon as the transaction is completed- before I leave Germany.
Yvonne! What is this?
He's double-crossed you.
"Compliments of the Olympic Committee." Very clever.
The book must have been substituted at the sports forum.
There's only one person clever enough to have done that: Chan, the detective.
Our game is with the Oriental now.
[Lee]
But when did you get it, Pop?
Took opportunity to acquire same during excitement in girls' dormitory.
Then no wonder you weren't worried when Hopkins got away.
Important lesson for good detective:
When all players hold suspicious cards, good idea to have joker up sleeve.
[Laughs] Well, we got that cleaned up, Pop.
Now all we have to do is land the guy...
that killed Miller and round up this gang of spies.
[Knocking Continues]
Letter, Mr. Chan.
- [Coin Clinks]
- Thank you so much.
Thank you.
What it is, Pop?
Envelope, like skin of banana, must be removed to digest contents.
Ticket to Olympic Games and letter.
Gee! Box 22.
That's where all the big shots will sit.
Letter apparently from big noise also.
"His Excellency, the Honorable Charles Zaraka...
"requests the pleasure of Mr. Chan's company... at the opening of the Olympic Games."
Zaraka?
You've never met him.
I have never met Santa Claus either, yet accept gift from same.
[Marching Band.
Fanfare, Up-tempo March]
[Crowd Applauding]
[Applauding Continues]
[March Continues In Distance]
Mr. Chan?
We haven't met, but I'm sure you've heard of me. Yvonne Roland.
Had looked forward to making acquaintance before leaving Berlin.
- This is His Excellency, the Honorable Charles Zaraka.
- A very great pleasure, Mr. Chan.
This is most unexpected compliment to humble policeman.
Are you sure that fellow knows his stuff?
He's the best in Berlin.
He'll read every move of their lips.
All right. They're in Box 22.
[Applauding Continues]
[No Audible Dialogue]
[March Continues]
A most illuminating spectacle,
Mr. Chan-
the nations of the world about to struggle for supremacy on the field of sports.
Yet behind all this there is another struggle going on constantly... for world supremacy in a more sinister field.
It's not a game for amateurs, Mr. Chan.
I hope you get my meaning.
Could not be more clear if magnified by 200-inch telescope.
Then wouldn't it be advisable for you to turn over the Cartwright invention to us...
and return to your own little game in Honolulu?
Perhaps... but player sometime disregard even most expert coaching... from sidelines.
- You have the afternoon to consider it.
- Thank you so much.
That's all I wanted to know.
Stick around. Enjoy yourself.
She's even got the nerve to sit in a box. Why don't we go in and make the cops arrest her?
Well, that's a box reserved for the foreign diplomatic corps. The police can't butt in there.
As long as she's with that big shot, she's protected by his diplomatic immunity.
Oh, you'd find some reason to stall out of it.
All right.
Have it your way then.
Aw, Betty, you shouldn't be like that.
A fella doesn't wanna be put on the spot by his girl all the time.
[Applauding In Distance]
- He's right over there by that center arch.
- Thanks.
Mr. Lee Chan?
I have a message for your father.
He's on the south side of the stadium in a box.
- Will you take me to him, please?
- Sure. Now you fix things up with Dick.
I'll see ya later.
Let's go, my man.
Drive us around the south entrance.
- Okay.
- No. Let's walk. It's quicker.
- Dick! Dick!
- [Car Door Slams]
- Get going!
- [Engine Starts]
Dick!
Mr. Chan, the ceremonies are almost over.
What is your answer?
Only one possible for... amateur.
Device will be returned to United States War Department.
- Thank you so much for a very enjoyable afternoon.
- It was a pleasure.
- Here.
- Let me go, you idiot!
Mr. Chan,
Lee has been kidnapped.
Lee?
You have our deepest sympathy, Mr. Chan.
If we can be of service, please call on us.
- [Knocks]
- Come in, please.
There is no news yet.
If the boy is in Berlin, we'll find him.
A dragnet is closing in on every known criminal hideout.
Don't give up hope.
Ancient Chinese philosopher say...
"Hope is sunshine which illuminate darkest path."
[Glass Breaks]
"If you wish news of your son...
"be in your same seat in the Olympic stadium tomorrow... alone and unguarded."
Eleven more hours of anxious waiting.
Don't fear, Mr. Chan.
Tomorrow they'll walk into a trap.
- The police will be there and make short work of them.
- No. Instructions very explicit.
Must walk path... alone.
[Announcer] 1,500-meter title won by Lovelock, New Zealand.
The time. Three minutes,
47 and 8/10 seconds.
- A new Olympic and world's record.
- Oh, the relay's going to start.
This is gonna be a new record sure.
[Pistol Fires]
- Come on, Jesse. Open up that lead!
- Come on. Take 'em!
Pick 'em up, big boy!
Pick 'em up and lay 'em down!
- [Woman] Let's go! Wykoff!
- [Woman #2] Come on, Metcalfe!
- [Man Shouts In Foreign Language]
- [Woman] Come on, Ralph!
- [Man] Look at that boy go!
- [Man #2 Shouts In Foreign Language]
- [Woman] Open up that lead, Franklin!
- [Woman] Come on, Franklin!
[All Cheering, Shouting, Indistinct]
[Man Shouts In Foreign Language]
[Women]
Come on, Frankie!
[Man] Look at that Wykoff go!
Break that record!
- [Woman] Come on, Wykoff! Come on, Wykoff!
- [Men, Women Continue Cheering]
[Announcer] 100-meter relay title won by the United States.
Time.39 and 8/10 seconds.
A new Olympic and world's record.
- Are all the men at their posts?
- Yes, Inspector.
- Every exit in this part of the stadium is covered.
- Good.
- There goes Dick. He'll take 'em in the pole vault.
- You've got that all set, huh?
Well, if he doesn't,
I'll break his neck.
[Announcer] Masters of the United States has just cleared...
- 14 feet and two inches on his second try.
- He did 14 feet and two inches.
Oh, Dick can do better than that.
- [All Chattering]
- Way to go, old fella.
Message for gentleman in Box 22.
[Announcer] The bar for the pole vault has just been raised to 14 feet, three inches.
[Cartwright] It's rather an extraordinary request, Mr. Chan.
I don't know how to answer you. I didn't even know you had the device in your possession.
- Very well, you know it now.
- I don't feel I have anything to say about its disposal.
I signed my rights over to Mr. Hopkins and retained only a small interest.
Hopkins is a fugitive from justice.
But if I have your authority to use the device... we can deal with these criminals.
- Are you willing to put it back in their hands, Mr. Chan?
- Cannot answer as officer.
Must speak as very humble father.
- If there's no other way, of course you have my permission.
- Good.
Please accept gratitude of most anxious parent.
Besides, Mr. Cartwright, when the boy is returned safely... we will go after the criminals and get it back.
One more request, please.
This time must insist on acting alone.
Any effort to help might result in serious consequence.
You have our word, Mr. Chan.
We will wait for a message from you.
Hmm.
Good-bye.
And as a further precaution for your safety, Mr. Cartwright... you will remain with me.
He's here.
Checkmate.
How do you do, Mr. Chan?
I'm glad you followed instructions this time and didn't depend on the police.
Wise philosopher once say...
"Only foolish man will not acknowledge defeat."
- I'm sure he was Chinese to have been so clever.
- Thank you so much.
Am ready to complete transaction.
- May now see number one son?
- In just a moment.
There's one more, uh, formality.
- Ask Mr. Hopkins to come in.
- Yes, sir.
You may put the device on the desk, Mr. Chan.
That's it- Chan's signal.
His transmitter's working.
What does your direction finder say?
North by northeast, two points east.
Calling B.P. 41.
Calling B.P. 41. Calling B.P. 41.
Coming in.
Car 37 picked it up.
- "North by northeast."
- North by northeast.
- "Two points east."
- Two points east.
Contact all cars in Areas "D" and "F" for check on direction.
Calling all cars, Areas "D" and "F."
Pardon our caution, Mr. Chan... but Mr. Hopkins will have to identify the mechanism... just to be sure there hasn't been another, uh, mistake.
Yes. This is the Cartwright invention.
Thank you, Mr. Hopkins. That's all.
And now my son, please?
- Bring the boy in.
- Yes, sir.
Car 46 reporting second triangulation point.
- "West by southwest."
- West by southwest.
- "Six points south."
- Six points south.
Car 49 reporting third point.
- "South by southeast."
- South by southeast.
- "One point south."
- One point south.
Notify all cars to converge on Area "D," Block 21.
That definitely sets your location.
Your plans worked perfectly.
Exactly. Soon we will be there, and you will have your device back.
- Calling all cars.
- All right, Sergeant. Go ahead.
I'm sorry I got you into this, Pop.
Danger, like red light on end of moving train, now safely past.
[Zaraka]
Except for one slight detail.
I must make very certain that the pursuit ends here.
I'll remember you when my plane is crossing the border out of Germany.
Good-bye, Mr. Chan.
Just a moment, Zaraka.
Were you planning to leave?
Get their guns.
Line up over there, all of you!
Just a minute.
Give me that bag.
Still playing tricks, eh, Mr. Chan?
- What is it?
- It's a phony.
- It's a transmitter!
- Chan's signal stopped coming through.
- They've discovered the trick.
- Call the other cars. See if they have contact.
Calling all cars.
Calling all cars.
Very clever, Mr. Chan- in touch with the police ever since you've been here.
Come on.
Where is it? And talk fast.
- All cars have lost contact.
- Then instruct them to proceed in the same direction at full speed.
- We must get to Chan.
- Calling all cars.
For the last time, where is the Cartwright invention?
Reposing in place of utmost safety.
Get away from that kid.
Back against the wall, you.
Do I get my answer?
[Engines Stopping]
[Brakes Squeaking]
- It's the police.
- Surround the house.
Don't let any of them get away.
[Battering On Door]
Search the house!
- They went up there!
- Round them up!
- [Clicks Heels]
- Mr. Chan, you see? We have arrived in time.
- The police of Berlin are very efficient.
- [Gunshot]
Inspector! Inspector Strasser!
Keep him covered.
Most unfortunate occurrence.
He's still alive.
Remove him. Get the doctor.
If Mr. Hopkins regain consciousness, report immediately.
Okay, Pop.
- What happened in here?
- I was going by the door when I heard a shot.
As I stepped in, Hopkins was lying on the floor, and Hughes was standing over him.
You can't pin that shooting on me.
I just came in through that door, when l-
One moment, please.
- You did not come into room when shot fired?
- No, I stopped at the door.
Strange.
[Chan] Ink spilled here when Mr. Hopkins fall... yet stain your shoe while standing at door.
Conclusive proof you were close to Mr. Hopkins when he fell.
Now very evident attempted murder of Hopkins... was last act to save self.
You are murderer of mechanic Miller in Honolulu...
and thief of own invention.
That's ridiculous.
I've helped you in every way possible.
If I'd wanted to steal the invention,
I could have easily made a copy.
That would have been obvious way and easy to trace.
But you saw opportunity to gain large fortune... without sharing with your partner, Mr. Hopkins.
[Chan] So devised clever scheme to remove suspicion from self...
by having Miller murder pilot Edwards and steal robot from test plane.
Then, assisted by Miss Roland, you murder Miller... and turn device over to Miss Roland... for delivery to Mr. Zaraka, head of foreign spy ring.
Second point. When Miss Roland disappear before boat reach dock... quite evident someone warned her of plan for capture.
- Hopkins knew the plan as well as I did. He could have-
- Excuse, please.
Mr. Hopkins entirely innocent.
Here tonight he perform heroic deed... when, at risk of his own life, he identify imitation as real device... to assist Charlie Chan in rounding up ring of spies.
And now, final evidence.
The time he disappear from hotel room... found something you overlooked:
Unfinished cablegram written in Mr. Hopkins's own hand...
addressed to United States
War Department.
"Have recovered
Cartwright invention.
Returning to America immediately for"-
- That's where it ends.
- Observe, please, what follows.
[Strasser]
There's nothing but a blot across the page.
Indicate when writing message,
Mr. Hopkins suddenly interrupted by action... which cause pen to slip from fingers.
Pop, Mr. Hopkins is still unconscious, but he's gonna be all right.
The doctor found a bump on his head that must have been made a couple of days ago.
Thank you so much for corroboration- prove you knock Mr. Hopkins unconscious... then drop him from window into arms of confederates, as seen by son Lee.
- That is all.
- Take them out.
Well, it looks like we cleaned this case up, Pop.
But how did you change the robot into a transmitter?
Constructed same in most efficient
Berlin police laboratory... with help of honorable inspector.
You're a fine officer, Mr. Chan.
You went through with your duty even though it meant risking your son's life.
- Better for Oriental to lose life than to lose face.
- You bet. But, you know... for a while I was afraid I wouldn't be there to win that 100-meter swim tomorrow.
- Perhaps good idea not to accept gold medal until race is won.
- [Chuckles] Don't worry, Pop.
I learned to sprint when you used to chase me through the water with a paddle.
Come on, Lee, boy!
Oh, yeah!
Come on! Come on!
- Come on!
- He won!
- Attaboy, Lee!
- Thank you.
- Good work!
- Thanks.
- [Dick] Congratulations!
Congratulations, fella!
Ah, thanks!
- I made it, Pop!
- Very lucky.
- Was prepared for emergency.
- [Laughing]
Judd, you can't.
I got to get in the house.
Poke your head out in the clear, and a Falin will get you.
But Melissa, she's going to have a baby.
Hit you, David?
No Falin can ever get me, Uncle Judd.
Oh, God, give her the strength to be good, to be never hateful and never fight.
And don't let her carry the burden of fear, watching her loved ones and seeing them die.
Always asking out of her heart,
" Why has it got to be?
Why has it got to be?"
When it's twilight on the trail
And I jog along
The world is like a dream
And the ripple of the stream is my song
When it's twilight on the trail
And I rest once more
My ceiling is the sky
And the grass on which I lie is my floor
Never ever have a nickel in my jeans
Never ever have a debt to pay
Still I understand what real contentment means
Guess I was born that way
When it's twilight on the trail
And my voice is still
Please plant this heart of mine
Underneath the Lonesome Pine on the hill
And I says to him, I says,
"Look here, Zeke Denker,
" you're driving your hogs to mighty poor swill. "
Bet that buttoned him.
Not Zeke.
He's the laughingest man I ever met. Nothing bites him.
Laughs when it's clever enough to rain.
Laughs when the sun shines.
He looks me right in the eye...
Dave's better.
Is he?
Yep.
Perking up a mite.
Arm's a little green but I stuck a chaw of tobaccy on it.
Cold rifle barreI will do it more good.
What he have to say?
About the Falins I mean.
" Eat your sow belly and get for home. " That's what he said.
Said, " Ain't gonna be no fighting till I can tote a gun. "
And I come six miles.
Six miles.
I can throw a clump of dogwood that far.
I'm nigh on to 30 miles.
Look. Look.
Gather around now.
Gather around.
I'm really going to show you something now.
Maybe we's will get a go at the kid.
Whenever Judd Tolliver gets an itch to plug the Falins, he starts playing with the young ones.
I'm gonna be the human hub.
Now, Willie, you go down there and stop me if I get to going too fast.
Lizzie Bee, you better go down and help Willie.
Look out now, here I come.
Don't forget to stop me.
Well, why didn't you stop me?
Judd's better than that wagon show we saw once.
Melissa, you got a bellyache or something?
Just thinking, Lina.
Sakes and sassafras!
Thinking boils the pot over.
It boils over and over and over if you ain't thinking.
Killing.
All the time killing.
They are planning it now.
They done it yesterday, and the week before, and the year before that.
Ever since I was a little child they done it.
Kill a Falin.
Kill a Falin.
That's all they could say.
Plowing, splitting reins.
Filling the corn crib.
Kill a Falin! And the echo comes back to us from over the hills.
Kill a Tolliver.
Kill. Kill. Why?
Melissa!
What you biting your paws about, Auntie?
Worrying, I guess, June and Buddie ain't back yet.
Where they be?
Over at the yard doctor, getting a potion for you.
Is that the way you like it?
Just right.
You should have let me get a town doctor, Dave.
It don't look right.
It's too swole up.
You're awfully good to me, Auntie.
You're a good boy, Dave.
Your boy.
My boy.
Sometimes I wished I was,
Auntie. Then I wished I wasn't
'cause if I was, I couldn't marry June and if I wasn't...
Relations like we ones got me all thicked up.
Cousins are always thicker than fleas in the mountains, Dave.
I'm a big, big black bear.
I'm a mean black bear.
I'm getting closer.
I'll get you.
I'm coming closer.
You laugh at me, foreigner, and I'll... I'll...
I don't blame you, I'd do the same thing myself.
That was funny.
Why didn't you laugh?
She's one of the Tollivers.
That's still funny.
She didn't think so.
That's a woman's privilege.
Now, where were we?
Right in the middle of that fault, over there.
Yeah.
Two years supply of strip-coaI before we have to drift mine it.
We'll steam-shovel the top coal and make it pay for the railroad up here.
You haven't got it yet.
No.
Well, suppose you let me worry about that.
The right and title to that privilege is yours, my friend.
You got that privilege this very minute.
Start using it.
I was just running in that wood, and I heard she was a bear.
And when I looked around to see if she was going to eat me, she was gone.
Maybe she ate herself and disappeared.
Judd Tolliver, how you talk.
Child. Child. You mustn't.
Juny's coming back.
Maybe she stopped down by the river.
Looks like she fetched the river with her.
June!
Well, I brung it, didn't I?
June, if you ain't the lookingest...
I've been running across that log ever since I was knee high to a grasshopper.
I can catch a squirreI on it with one hand, but when that dog see that foreigner...
Foreigner?
He stopped right smack-dab in the middle of the log and I tripped.
What was the foreigner doing?
Don't know.
Wasn't looking.
Before you know it, there
I go. Plunk, right down.
What did he look like?
Just had a squint.
He's about so tall, about that wide.
Was all dressed in brown, even his hat.
And his coat had a belt.
Just a squint?
Dave Tolliver, if you're thinking what I'm a thinking, I'm going to tell you off.
Go down to the creek and wash your dirty face.
For two carrot seeds,
I'd rub it all over you.
You do it, and I'll spank you where it hurts.
You will, will you?
Did that hurt?
How could it?
Oh!
I've been talking to your pappy.
We's going to get married.
When?
Hog killing time.
Your pappy has invited all the Tollivers.
The whole kit and boodle of them.
I ain't marrying till green up.
Spring's always the time to do them things.
Then it'll be next green up and the next.
I don't feeI nothing.
Like... What do you mean?
I don't know.
Come on. Come on.
Dinner.
Come on.
Better make it just a dipping, June, or them hungry mouths will eat that table bare.
Ma. Come here.
Ma. Do I...
Do I like Dave?
Why, honey,
I think you do.
Like you like Pappy?
Well, you remember when
Dave went to Pokey Wells, you was a-grieving for him then, weren't you?
And when he's to home, he don't make no nevermind to you?
- But, Ma...
- Melissa, the folks are waiting for their dinner.
Coming.
Well, that's liking, honey.
This here man wants to talk to you, Judd.
Does, huh?
My name is Hale,
Jack Hale.
I wonder if I could see you alone.
Here's all right.
Well, I...
You see, I wanted to talk to you about coaI.
The coaI on your property,
I mean.
You know what I mean? The fault down about a mile.
Well, you've seen the coaI.
You know what I mean.
The fault. The Alton people,
I'm with them and they...
You was talking about coaI.
Oh, yes. CoaI.
There'll be a railroad up along the Ticopi and then down across the ridge to your place.
Who said there would?
I mean, of course, if it's agreeable with the contracting parties, like yourself.
The thing will make you rich.
There's no doubt about that.
And if we can make a deaI...
Who's the others?
The contract with you is for the coaI.
Who is the others?
Well, there's severaI other people, but mainly...
How long have you had that?
You ain't answered me yet.
When did this arm begin to show that color?
Three days ago now,
I think.
Get me some warm water, quick.
It ain't bad, is it?
Bad?
It's gangrenous infection.
The flesh, it's rotting, it's dying.
You ain't no doctor.
You wanna live, don't you?
Why didn't you get this man to a doctor? Did.
There it be. Snake brew.
You fooI.
He'll die if something isn't done.
Am I dying, Judd?
Sure.
Better start making the pine box, I guess.
That's just what you will be doing if something isn't done.
Now listen to me.
Once an infection like this sets in, it kills.
The only possible cure is to cut it out, and then pray.
Now do you understand?
No. No.
They don't understand.
They don't understand nothing but shooting and killing.
That's all they understand.
Melissa.
I been begging you to get a doctor, but no, you got to plan.
You got to scheme, you got to figure out how to kill. All of you.
Your crops could rot and your cattle starve.
And you wouldn't care as long as you was back of a squirreI rifle, and here was a Falin at the other end of it.
Now it's getting back at you. He's dying.
You heard him say it.
My Davie's dying.
Melissa.
Here.
I'm sorry,
I didn't know...
Here.
Get me a cloth, a tourniquet.
Something to tighten around his arm and shut off the circulation.
Get me some small knives, the sharpest you've got.
Get that fire going. Heat the knives till they're white-hot.
Keep that down and help me steady his arm.
This is going to hurt.
We have no anesthetic.
Something to put you to sleep, I mean.
Better stouting up the corn liquor with a little pepper.
Looks like
I'm gonna need it.
Ain't got no money, nowhere to spend it
Ain't got no wife, too independent
Ain't got no mule to ride around
It's just because I'm the poorest man in town
Poor me
Poor me
I wonder when I'm gonna end this misery
I made up that last line myself.
Yeah? That's what it sounded like.
Thinking maybe you might have a job for me, so I moseyed up.
Well, mosey down, and the quicker the better.
What you got your back up for, mister?
Go on, get on.
They're talking down in town as to how your boss saved
Dave Tolliver's life.
That so?
Yes, the idiot.
Two minutes after he'd met him, he's carving his initials in the fellow's arm.
And does it get him anything? It does not.
The whole thing's a washout.
No coaI, no railroad.
And as for this Judd Tolliver, he's just an ungratefuI chunk of dry rot.
They didn't ask him, did they?
Ask him what?
To save Dave's life.
Of course they didn't, you walking phonograph.
But what's that got to do with it?
We ones is funny people.
Mmm. Elderberries.
Elderberries?
Okay, partner, here's where I get off the train.
Ain't I gonna see you no more?
Well, I don't know.
Not unless your dad changes his mind.
Now, don't you think you'd better run along home?
First, could I put my arms around you?
Can you?
I'll say you can.
Say, you won't forget your lesson, will you?
Uh-uh.
Book learning is good for people because it makes them build what's inside of them.
Swell.
Some day I'm gonna build a automobile, I'm gonna build a plane...
Whoa! Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
And all those things you told me about.
Well, if you're gonna do all that, you'd better go home and start studying.
Bye.
Goodbye.
Come on, Tuffy, grab the coaI car.
There you go.
Well?
Pappy wants to see you.
He saw me,
I'm sorry to say.
He changed his mind.
You mean he'll sign the agreement?
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.
Wait a minute.
This isn't a gag, is it?
A what?
Skip it.
I'll take a chance.
This way. It's shorter.
Love is everywhere
Its music fills the air
You gonna talk to me now?
Not a chance. Not even if your father signed 40 contracts.
I'm just as stubborn as you are, young lady.
And not word you get out of me untiI you've apologized.
I didn't do nothing.
You didn't do nothing?
What do you call nothing?
You were going to spit in my eyes. You stomped on my foot.
And when I tried to teach Buddie his ABCs, you laughed at me.
And you call that nothing?
Oh, my!
What a nice pretty.
Where'd you get it?
It's just a...
Can I have it?
Why...
I can?
Well, ain't that sweet?
What do you say to apologize?
Just say, " Mr. Hale, I regret exceedingly my unfortunate error. "
Them's hard words.
All right.
Say it your own way.
I regret.
You regret what?
I'm apologizing.
All right. What do you wanna talk about?
Don't make no difference.
All right.
Let's talk about you.
I'd like that.
Well, some day very soon now, your father will have money, and you'll be married to Dave.
And what a lucky girI you are.
And all this around here will be...
Well, maybe over there will be a big house and with a lawn way down to here, and...
Did you ever see a grasshopper reaI close?
Have him spit in my eye?
Not me.
You see that little yellow spot on its leg?
Well, if you touch it, you know what will happen?
No. I give up. What?
Its leg will pop off.
You little savage.
Am I?
Yes, you are. And when I see Dave, I'm gonna tell him.
Let's walk. It's a mite near a mile here.
A mile?
I thought you said this was a shortcut.
Did I?
" Its successors and assigns forever,
" all mines, veins, seams and beds of coaI
" and all other minerals whatsoever already found
" or which may hereafter be found
" upon or under all that certain tract, piece or parceI of land
" situate, Iying and being in the... "
Slow down, man.
Them squirreI tracks and chicken scratches don't mean nothing to me.
You trying to tell me and Judd your coaI won't be disruptious to our corn?
Is that what you're trying to tell us?
That's right.
And we get quite a toting of money?
$5,000 in 30 days and a percentage of the company's earnings.
What's that percentage?
It's like pigs, Pappy. You get one out of six for taking care of them.
Oh! Figures sensible.
Mr. Hale, is this the kind of steam shoveI you told me about?
Yes, but you look in the back, Buddie, and you'll find a great big one.
- I'll say...
- Dave says it's sensible.
I guess it's sensible.
But there's one thing eating me.
What's that, Mr. Tolliver?
Is there no other way for you to build your railroad up to our place, except across the Falins?
But it won't be the Falins. The company will own the property.
Yeah, but it were the Falins.
They walked on it. They drove the sheep across it.
The spring water down by the Knuckle, they put their poisonous faces in it.
It's got the
Falins' smell on it.
And me ones will make money going on it? No.
No. There ain't gonna be a Tolliver...
It ain't gonna stop you from shooting the dirty swine, is it?
The land was here long afore they come. It's tetched with God.
And he ain't going to taint it just 'cause a lot of snakes is a- crawling in the fallows.
We been poor-hogging long enough.
I got a chance for fancies, and I'm gonna have them.
That ain't no talk to your pappy.
I'm talking to you, too!
I ought to spank your hide.
You don't need no fotch-on clothes to be happy.
Just a minute, Dave. I didn't want to start an argument.
Mr. Tolliver, I don't doubt that you have every reason to hate the Falins.
They must have done you a great wrong...
We don't want no preacher talk from you.
The Tollivers don't like the Falins and they know why.
And we don't want to be learned off by no outsiders.
But, Dave,
I'm not trying to...
You saved my life.
You was leaving without a squeaI when we turned you down.
You couldn't have done that without you was meaning right.
Just don't argue, that's all.
Where do we sign?
Right here.
The company's offering you $5,000.
That's a lot of money,
Mr. Falin.
Both sides of our right of way will still be yours.
It won't interfere with your farming.
Mr. Thurber here can vouch for our company.
He's kept its books for years.
Yes. That's right.
Indeed it is.
We don't want no taiI-ender drippings of a Tolliver.
Wade's right. You can't make butter out of goose grease.
Shut up!
What did
Judd Tolliver say?
Well, he said that...
He said he'd rot before he had anything to do with a Falin.
That sounds like Judd.
Where do I scratch?
Right here on the bottom line.
Jack, give us a hand.
You know something about carpentry.
What's the matter with it?
You're doing all right.
Yeah, I'm not running any kindergarten.
I got very little use for children.
In fact
I hate the brats.
Look at me.
Look what I'm doing.
If any of my friends saw me...
Say, did you send that check to Judd Tolliver?
Yeah, this morning. Listen.
Would you put a naiI in here?
Or... Don't let me keep you.
Going 'coon hunting, Dave?
Skunk.
Mighty nigh well, ain't it?
That's why
I'm going hunting.
I don't want you to fight, Dave.
Leave the Falins be.
There's turning over to be done.
And I'll be wanting corn husks for my mattresses.
And we got scrapple to make and all kinds of things.
You're the only big boy I've got, Dave.
Families round about got lots.
Maybe they wouldn't miss them none.
Maybe they wouldn't.
You're always snorting preachments,
Auntie. You make me sick.
Two pink-eyed doves sitting in a tree.
One for you and one for me.
Dave.
My eggs.
Ma! Pa! Dave!
We just got a letter.
We just got a letter.
Pa. A letter.
Juny.
We just got a letter.
A man gave to me up the road.
Ma, look!
You act like we never got one before.
We got one when Dave come to live with us and then we got another one when...
Who's it for?
Whoever it's writ to on the front.
Sure enough.
Well, might as well open it.
What for? We ain't going to be no better off.
Well, you ain't much help.
Open her up anyway, Judd.
It's from the coaI company. See?
There's a picture of a mine on it.
It's just a piece of paper.
This here's a check.
I seen one once in Gaptown.
Folks, we're richer than cream cheese.
And I can get the things
I want, can't I, Pappy?
Now, now, now.
Not so jumpy.
There's one thing we got to get more important than that first, and that's a new dress for Melissa.
Oh! Judd.
You sure got it coming to you, Mammy.
With pearl buttons it'll have. Won't it, Pappy?
Yeah, pearI buttons.
And the next thing we got to get is hat and shoes for Mammy.
It just...
You're making me cry.
Judd Tolliver, you said you weren't talking to me.
That was when
I was poor. $5,000.
Wait a minute. I got some choosing to do, too.
Part of that's mine.
Sure. Half.
Half? I get way less than half.
My land's just a little hog bag.
Which way says you win or lose?
North.
South. You lose, so you get half.
You know the first thing
I'm gonna buy?
Dave Tolliver, get some pepper in you.
What?
For more than a month now, somebody's been a
- keeping a secret in a closet.
And I'm thinking maybe it's a picture of something she's a-needing.
So the first thing
I'm gonna do...
Oh, no. Now, Dave.
Yes, now.
Dave, don't.
Dave.
Can't hear. Both ears is bad.
If you go in that closet...
Next time I'll puff you clean over to Coon Hollow.
If you go in there, I'll never talk to you again.
Why, it's only fun. There ain't nothing in there you want.
Nothing that'd be important to you. June.
Never.
I only want to buy...
Never.
Dave.
You're sure pretty.
Am I?
Like a budding sapling without even room for a robin to sit.
You're just silly.
I been silly ever since the sap come up out of the trees.
I get silly just looking at you.
When we get married...
It ain't green up yet.
You're going to have ivory combs in your hair and you're gonna have blood-red wine to drink.
Wine?
And down by the sty, we'll build a big house...
With grass growing all the way down?
The ivory combs, they was my idea.
And the big house?
Mr. Hale.
He thought of that.
He's drawn me a piece of paper.
It's got a bathtub in it, June.
In the middle of the house it is.
And it's get water that can be turned on with the handle.
And there's a room where you keep babies, and it's...
Get out of here, Dave.
Honey.
Dave, please.
Sure.
Love is everywhere
Its music fills the air
All nature seems to hum
"A melody from the sky!"
Over on the hill,
I see a whippoorwill
I hear its song become
"A melody from the sky!"
And there's a bluebird singing to his lady love above
A love song
taken from the whispering breeze in the trees
Love is everywhere
Its music fills the air
All nature seems to hum
"A melody from the sky!"
By Juckies, that's what I call whistling and singing.
I'm awfuI glad to see you, Tater.
Well, you never was before.
You've changed.
You're different.
You're... I'm awfuI glad to see you.
You said that.
Did I?
Well, I am glad.
Well, here he is, safe and delivered. So long.
Bye, Tater.
Goodbye, engineer. And don't forget what Mr. Hale told you.
Watch the steam in your boiler.
Love is everywhere
Its music fills the air
All nature seems to hum
"A melody from the sky!"
Love is everywhere
David, get away from there.
Dave, you ain't said nothing about my steam shoveI.
Your... Is that what it is?
Yeah. It works, too.
Uncle Jack, he showed me...
Uncle Jack?
Uh-huh. Mr. Hale. You know. He said, " When this thing gets up here,
" you got to pull this thing. "
See? See how it works?
Hemlocks. Mr. Hale's sure smart, ain't he?
Bet he is. Sis, she says he's the smartestest man she ever seen.
She said what?
Sure works, don't it?
I'm wanna be an engineer, too, when I get big.
When did June say that about Mr. Hale?
She says it all the time, every day at most, when she takes me down there.
She takes you down there every day?
Uh-huh.
I sit with Corsey, I do.
Corsey?
He's an engineer.
He's the best, he is.
What does June do when you're with Corsey, Buddie?
She goes walking with Uncle Jack.
They don't bother me at all.
Now watch me.
Tuffy, go on.
Go get some coaI.
Go on, go get some coaI.
Oh! Buddie.
Huh?
Nothing.
Mr. Thurber,
Mr. Thurber.
Hello, Buddie.
I hope he ain't no bother to you, Mr. Thurber.
Bother! Really
I'm compelled to laugh.
This charming little fellow.
Ridiculous, Miss Tolliver.
It's only when you've seen the world like I have, that you learn to appreciate the laughter of children.
Their childish pranks and their naive questions.
I remember once on the boat coming over from England.
There was dear little curly-headed fellow, he must have been about...
June, there's
Mr. Corsey.
Corsey.
Howdy, son.
What's holding you up?
Come on.
How are you this morning?
All right.
Atta boy!
Whoops-a-daisy.
Charming child.
Yes.
Mr. Thurber, you better check with Mills about that last carload of ties.
They weren't creosoted.
They can't...
Again?
Mmm-hmm.
I'm busy.
Come on, get up.
You can see that, can't you?
Uh-huh.
Well?
Mmm-hmm.
You call that an answer?
Mmm-hmm.
Listen,
Miss Uh-uh and Uh-huh.
Outside, up the hill to your family.
You've probably got plenty of work to do.
And don't say uh-huh.
Uh-uh.
Woman, you're a nut.
Good. I like that.
You like being a nut.
No, being a woman.
UntiI now, you've been thinking I'm a girI.
You're not a woman.
You're not even a girI.
I ain't?
No, you're just a child no bigger than that.
And from here up?
I'm not fooling you. I'm going to tell you something.
What do you do with your spare time?
This is very interesting.
Now, stop your clowning.
June, you're making a big mistake.
Pretty soon you'll be married to Dave, and what have you done about it?
What do you want me to do?
I want you to go to schooI.
To what?
SchooI.
Can't you realize what the future holds for you and your family?
Uh-huh.
All right, what?
A fight with the Falins.
You're impossible.
I ain't impossible.
I'd like to know what you'd call it.
I can listen.
You can?
All right, listen to this.
Look at Buddie.
He's a swell little kid and he's smart as a whip.
He'll learn and he'll learn fast.
And the minute he arrives, these mountains can't hold him.
He'll change, June, and you'll he proud of him, but you'll be unhappy too because he'll speak a different language.
You're smart and
I can understand you.
Look, June, I'm not trying to hurt your feelings.
I think you're a swell girI.
But if you ever were in the city once, just once, you'd understand what I mean.
Remember what you told me yesterday.
None of you could read that check.
But you just guessed at it because there was a picture of a coaI mine on it.
And from now on,
Dave and your father will be getting lots of letters.
See what I mean?
I ain't going to no town.
You don't have to. You can get some books and read at home.
Hire a teacher.
You've got money, and you'll have more.
And once you get into it, you'll be so blamed happy you'll want to give me a big hug.
Would I?
Hello.
Hale speaking, Operator.
Hello, Lewis.
What's on your mind?
You what?
You want me to come to town?
Listen, I've got some bulldogs up here by the name of
Tolliver and Falin.
And if I leave...
Yeah, Lewis, but I...
Oh...
All right. Yeah.
I'll leave in the morning.
Right.
Hey, wait a minute.
What about those ties?
You did, huh?
Okay, I'll see you soon.
Well, June, it looks like...
The mountains is good enough for us. They're good enough for you.
You ain't a- going to town.
But, Judd...
I'm a-talking.
The idea.
You getting close to marrying time and wanting to go to schooI.
You gonna make clabber cheese any better if you can read and write?
Or churn butter or fix a shirt or mend socks?
That's what a wife is supposed to do.
Don't take no education to show you where a hen lays her eggs.
I ain't gonna listen to any more.
June.
Yeah, and you can use it till the blood comes.
But I won't change my mind.
You and the mountains ain't going to make no dried up cornstalk out of me.
You ain't got the right.
I'm gonna be smart and I'm gonna think.
Yes, I am. And I'm gonna be a help to Dave when those checks start coming in.
You ain't ever been to the city.
You don't know what it means.
You're going to stay here.
And be a cull, just like Mammy?
June.
She knows what I'm driving at.
She ain't never get to go no place.
Just stayed here and dried up.
Getting older, faster than she should.
Weren't you, Mammy?
I was born old.
She could have been young and beautifuI.
She is beautifuI.
Listen, June child.
I ain't no mean father.
I mean, I ain't a never wanting to be.
You looked at me just like a stranger, just now.
Kind of hurt inside.
Pappy.
Sure be glad to give you a lift, Miss June.
This animaI of mine will carry double and get you to Gaptown quicker than a hound dog can smell a pole cat.
That's very nice of you, Mr. Keever but I'm a-waiting, a friend, you know.
Oh!
The smell of winter's stouter than horse radish.
Hope it don't kick up a rain.
Goodbye.
Bye.
Where you going?
That a way.
Just a stroll?
Oh, no. Going to town.
Smell of winter's stouter than horse radish.
Thought you told me you'd never been to town.
Might, might not.
Hope it don't kick up a rain.
I give up.
Come on, get in.
No. I wouldn't. It might be putting you out.
It's only a short hop and a tussle to town.
Get in.
Say, if it's any of my business, why are you going to town?
Education. Do you have to keep your foot on the brake all the time?
When did you get that idea?
I see you keep jiggling it back and...
You know what I mean.
When?
Talking to people.
Who?
Oh, about.
It was what
I told you, wasn't it?
Did you?
Yes, you was one of them.
I was all of them.
Now see here, I meant what
I said. I sincerely meant it.
But you're up to something phony.
People don't just get an idea and then go.
Did you ever stand under a falling tree or see a pole cat back up?
That's not funny.
What did your father say about it, and Dave?
They was mostly agreeing, especially Dave.
He said when those checks start traipsing in...
I said that.
All right, I'll walk.
Same thing eating you?
Huh?
Sure makes me feeI bad.
That's what I wanna talk to you about.
Nice of you. Horse gets out of the barn and now you want to lock the door.
Well, he ain't got her yet.
Who ain't got what...
Wait a minute.
Ain't you and I talking about the same thing?
You bet we're talking about the same thing.
I was feeling when he saved my life but I just didn't know what it was then.
Fever I says. Or maybe the lead's splashing something in my eyes.
But I ought to have known. It was him being nice to Buddie.
It was him...
Wait a minute, son.
You're making a gourd trap, but it's too big to catch meadow larks and too small to catch ideas.
What are you talking about?
Let's get June right here.
We ones is going to settle this matter for good.
You want her here?
Fine.
You tell her she could go to town, now you tell me you want her here.
Ain't you a little tetched?
I tell her she can go where?
Into town to get educated.
Got to read books, she said you said.
Don't want no cull for a wife, she said you said.
She said...
She ain't gone.
You didn't let her go, did you?
Of course, been gone maybe two hours now.
Took her down to the ridge to meet the mailman.
She said...
It was him that done it.
Him that said he was our friend.
That's why he gave us the money.
That's why he gave us the money. You understand?
He took her away.
He's been wanting to take her, but he was a-feared.
All right.
He thinks now maybe the money will keep us from telling him that we ones up here don't take nobody's woman.
Money ain't a- stopping us from that.
Money ain't a- stopping us from...
Where are you going?
I'm going hunting.
You're sure that was Dave Tolliver?
He was a-headed for the camp and across our property, too.
If he's down there, he's on our property.
Might just as well go down and look into it.
That's my job.
I've been sort of shamed since
I only get him in the arm.
You're right.
Rub out the mistake, Son.
So help me, he isn't here.
On my word of honor, he isn't here. Do you understand me?
Yeah.
He went downtown.
Down to Gaptown, I mean.
She didn't go with him?
No, I told you!
He was alone, and... You sure they didn't meet some place?
With these, I saw him.
He got into his wagon, on this side...
You ain't answering my question.
I can't answer that 'cause I don't know.
I watched him there on the road.
There was nobody with him then, because...
Mr. Thurber,
I'm a-quitting.
No, you're not.
In times like this, you gotta be a man.
A man must never been a coward.
I got to get to Gaptown to tell the people down there what's up.
But it's over.
There's nothing to tell!
There ain't, eh?
You don't know.
Look at here, Dave Tolliver's gone to Gaptown to get Mr. Hale.
He bust Wade Falin on the beak.
And when a Tolliver busts a
Falin on the beak, that means war.
And I gotta tell a- people in Gaptown, so they can scuttle for safety.
Good heavens!
Jenkins.
Jenkins.
Biggest fight.
Outside camp.
Wade Falin came down...
Dave Tolliver...
And shoved him over the cliff...
I knew that thing was going to break out again.
Just a matter of time and that's all we needed.
And I was standing right there.
I heard enough.
And he...
Dave Tolliver licked Wade Falin.
And now he's coming to get Mr. Hale.
Whoa!
Is there anything else you need? No.
Well, if you think of anything, just call the camp and I'll have one of the men bring it down.
I'm sorry, but...
Well?
The room, you know, where Miss
Tolliver was going to stay...
Well, that room,
I'm afraid...
Afraid of what?
Well, it ain't a fitting place.
It kind of leaks, you know.
Hold it. There's trouble, ain't there?
Trouble?
I can smell it.
What's wrong?
I don't want no fighting.
Fighting?
Dave.
Say, what is this?
He's coming to get me.
Who told you?
You've seen him?
All town knows it. And I don't want no trouble around here.
You gotta go.
I've got to what?
I know... I've seen him the time he shot down Jim Falin.
You gotta get out of town.
What have I done to him that he should want to harm me?
Did I ever do anything to him?
No, you didn't.
But I wish
I hadn't come down.
Will you go?
Please go.
You lied, didn't you?
Everything you said coming down out of the mountains?
I knew you were Iying then, and something inside of me told me I should have sent you home.
Well, let him come.
I never saw such a ferocious look in a man's eyes in my life.
I tell you, it's gonna be the biggest fight of the year.
Dave... Dave come out of the tent, like a shot.
He lit right on top of Wade.
And rammed down on him with a right and left! Right!
Wade got away from Dave.
Dave got him right on the edge of the cliff, he had him down, he was beating his head down and he says,
" I'll kill you, I'll kill you, I'll kill you!
" You'll take my girl, will you?"
He reached him up and he says...
Nice day, ain't it?
Give me a beer.
I gotta see somebody.
Yeah, Dave Tolliver.
And how'd you like to tell him we was here.
In the backroom.
There's Dave Tolliver coming in now.
And he ain't going out.
You can get him right from here.
We don't have to sneak our shots at the Tolliver.
Stay here, Wade.
Hell.
You sing about Stack O' Lee and keep right on singing.
When the rain was falling fast
One dark and stormy night
Stack O' Lee and Billy Lyons
Had an awful fight
Bad, bad, bad old Stack O' Lee
You ain't going to do nothing,
Dave. It's all my fault.
Talk will keep.
Now, let's get this thing straight.
You're down here looking for trouble.
I haven't done anything, but I can see you won't believe that.
All right.
This is worth walking for.
How are you doing, Buck?
Drop them gun.
We're going about our own business.
Of course, you are.
Put them down.
Certainly.
Anything to oblige.
Funny you ain't trying to stop the fight.
Fist fight won't do no harm.
Gun toting don't go.
No hard feeling.
No.
No.
You're doing a good job, Mr.
Hale. Maybe we can help you.
So that's the way it is, huh?
Any way you wanna look at it.
You shouldn't mess in old troubles.
Dogs did howl
Dogs did bark
When Stack O' Lee the murderer
went creeping through the dark
Bad, bad, bad old Stack O' Lee
Get out of here and take her with you!
I can run from no Falin.
I guess, here in the mountains a woman doesn't mean very much.
You came here to get her, didn't you?
Bam, bam, bam, bam
Went Stack's 44
Next time I saw Billy Lyons
He's stretched out on the floor
Bad, bad, bad old Stack O' Lee
Stop your drinking whiskey
With your...
Look what happened to poor old Stack O' Lee
Okay, I'm licked.
So what?
You got lots to learn,
Mr. Hale, lots.
I scratched a bargain with you on a piece of paper, and I kept it.
But now, you're sticking your nose in my personaI affairs, so from now on bargains don't count.
And you won't be long finding that out.
Jack! Jack!
Dave Tolliver!
He's coming to get you!
There's going to be a big fight.
Is there?
What are you doing here?
I'm here 'cause
I ain't going back.
I thought I told Dave to take you...
The sheriff said,
"I'm taking you
" to the outskirts of town,
Dave Tolliver.
" I'm leaving the rest to your own judgment. "
Now see here, I'm not going to allow you...
I ain't listening.
You told me to get an education,
I'm getting an education.
I'm staying here. If I can't stay here, I'll stay where I can stay.
You can't stop me, nobody's gonna stop me!
I'll show the whole kit and boodle of you how much I can get learned.
I'll be smarter than you!
That's what I'll be!
Now listen, you little stick of dynamite.
You're getting out of here now.
You're going back up in the mountains.
I've heard enough of you and I've seen enough of you.
For the present, at least.
Now, come on, get out.
You...
All right, I'll go if you want me to go.
Sure.
I don't want people not to want me.
Wait a minute.
How did you do that?
Oh, that.
You did it when you pushed me down.
I'm sorry.
It might have been a rusty naiI or something.
We'd better fix it up.
Come over here.
So that's it, is it?
And I thought you were just interested in the coaI business.
She's hurt her hand.
You've killed your future, around here, anyway.
You're not satisfied with one enemy, you make two.
You realize what you've done?
Now the Falins hate you, the
Tollivers will never forgive you.
The Tollivers, why?
That's why.
That girI's gonna go back to the mountains, now.
She didn't come here to start any trouble, it just happened.
She's got a mind of her own, and if she wants to stay here she can.
In this town?
Impossible.
I'll take her to Brighton.
Or Plenny or Sand Creek. It doesn't matter where you take her around here, you're about to meet Tollivers.
All right, I'll take her to Louisville to my sister.
What do you think of that?
Nothing.
Except that
I'm flabbergasted.
Nonplussed.
And if you don't mind me saying so,
I think you're just a little bit nuts.
Thank you.
Both of you.
Mr. Hale! Oh, Mr. Hale!
You forgot the hat.
Thanks, Leo.
Well, here you are.
Do I...
Are you sure your sister will recognize me?
I don't see how she can miss.
Do I look all right?
My dear young lady, reticent as I am by nature, it behooves me at this moment to tell you that you're wearing the finest the city affords.
All aboard!
Well, you better get on.
Ain't... Ain't you gonna kiss me goodbye?
Well, that's over with.
Is it?
Yeah. What do you mean, " Is it"?
No, I mean, I'm glad it's over with.
Are you?
She's nuts.
Is she?
Sure she is.
Any fooI can see that.
Well, perhaps, that's why I'm a little stupid.
Yeah, maybe that's...
Say, what is this
"isn't " and " is she"?
My dear fellow, if you'll allow me, let us take " isn't " and " is she. "
" Is" is that we both know,
I hope, is a verb.
" It" is a neuter gender, and she is the feminine.
Thus, we have the neuter and the feminine, but no masculine.
" What? No masculine," you say, then I say...
" I'm nuts," that's what you say.
Yeah, that's right, you're nuts!
She's in love with you, Jack.
In love? Who?
June.
Are you crazy?
No, no, that's already been settled.
You're the one who's crazy.
Why, she's been goo-gooing, gee-geeing all over you ever since we started the camp.
Don't talk nonsense.
In love. Why, she only came down to camp to bring Buddie.
In love with me.
You're an idiot.
I hope so.
I sincerely hope so.
The camp, Thurber.
It's on fire!
A bunch of fellows came over the hill carrying torches.
The fellow leading him was a-shooting.
The Falins.
Well... Never mind, we'll talk about that later.
I'll get the stock out of the corral.
You get the instruments and maps out of there.
So that's how you want it, is it?
All right, you skulking coyotes, I'll play your game.
They're not gonna let me...
I'll put this road through if I have to use your dirty rotten bodies for ties.
I'll do it if I have to hire every man in Gaptown to finish the job.
If you could have seen it
I know you would have split your sides a
- laughing.
I was sitting there mending, and I hear the dripping and the sizzling, and I says to myself,
I says, " I bet a rooster
" it's the soft soap a- boiling over. "
And sure enough...
Better try some of these dandelion greens, son.
Zeke Denker fetched them over this morning.
I ain't hungry.
But, David, you gotta eat something after all the plowing you've done.
Pappy.
A is the first letter in the alphabet.
Because it means
"And" " Apple" and " Ax. "
What's this one, Pappy?
You mean this one?
Offhand I'd say it's alike an ox yoke.
Didn't Mr. Hale tell you?
He told me but I forgot.
It ain't like no Tolliver to forget.
Now, if I would have been told...
You know what that is?
Yeah.
Civilization!
David, you oughtn't to have done that!
I'm through pretending.
Like you've been doing all of last month.
Saying things you didn't mean.
I'm getting sick of the whole thing.
Now, son, look, you gotta keep your shirt on.
If it's June you're worrying about, she'll be back pretty short.
No, she ain't.
She ain't never coming back.
Not the June I know.
Ain't nothing gonna be the way it was.
Look at Buddie, even he's different.
So are you.
Me?
Yes, you are.
Them new fangled machines down in Ticopi that's doing it.
Every day you traipse down there with Buddie and you come back being different.
Half the time you're feeling glad.
Like last week, they tore up one of our fields.
Them machines don't care who's been plowing there for 50 years.
The Tollivers don't mean nothing to them.
I ain't nobody with a high temper.
But you're talking unreasonable.
We're getting rich, ain't we?
Look at them five checks over there in that bowI.
Half of them is yours.
And how did we get them?
Just doing nothing.
And if that's what you call civilization, then I'm for it.
Judd!
He needs a-talking to.
It ain't right for no young man to brood about nothing.
This you call nothing, huh?
Listen, there's got to be a change, you see?
Not for me, there ain't.
There ain't no more chance of me changing than there is of that old Lonesome
Pine changed into a hickory.
I belong to the earth.
The plowed up soiI.
I was raised and
I'm gonna die in it.
You got what you like?
You can have it.
Me, I'm going back. Back where my pappy raised me.
David, you can't do that.
You're our boy.
I mean, you're like our boy.
I ain't a-wanting you to go.
Two pink-eyed doves sitting in a tree, one for you, one for me.
For June.
For when it's twilight on the trail
And I jog along
The world is like a dream
And the ripple of the stream
Is my song
For when it's twilight on the trail
Hello?
Well, well, well,
Miss Tolliver.
What, again?
Obviously.
Do I tell her you're out to tea?
No, I'll talk to her.
You'd better go out and check with Marks about those uprights.
Naturally.
Hello, June.
Are you mad at somebody or something?
Well, you talk like it.
Oh, yeah.
Busy? You don't know what busy means.
I ain't...
I mean, I haven't had a minute to myself.
This morning I learnt all about the Revolution.
It was just like a feud.
In 1775...
Wait a minute, June.
Come in.
Mr. Hale, we've got that slue banked.
That's fine, Taylor.
Wait a minute, get the steam shoveI out on the bridge so we can start to fill in the morning.
Yes, sir.
Yeah, June?
Yeah.
But that wasn't Patrick Henry, that was Lord Cornwallis.
Cornwallis.
All right. Cornwallis.
What difference does it make?
How are you?
How's Pappy and Mammy and Buddie?
They are?
Yeah.
Say, June, you know you've got the prettiest eyes.
Yeah.
And the cutest nose.
Say, have you got a dimple?
You get a fix, Son?
She's all sort onto the bridge and ready to go.
We'll pop her off in the morning.
Kind of like to have
Mr. Hale see it.
Hey, Pappy.
Now we're here for Mr. Corsey?
Yeah, but you stay right here till your pappy gets through talking to Mr. Hale.
Thanks, Pappy.
Can I come in,
Mr. Hale?
Sure, come on in.
I got serious things to talk to you about, Mr. Hale.
Sit down.
And now, it's Dave that's going away.
It's gotten me worried.
About Melissa, I mean.
She don't sing no more, Mr. Hale.
Sun up always seen her singing, you know?
I'm sorry about Melissa, but there's nothing I can do.
I got troubles of my own.
You gotta come, Mr. Hale.
Melissa, she'll listen to you.
Somehow, I don't talk the right language to her.
No wonder you can't speak a language which Melissa understands.
I've never heard her favor your feud to the Falins.
Have you done anything to stop it? No, you haven't.
You came down here to blame me for June's going away and for Dave's leaving.
You'd like to thrust the responsibility for Melissa's suffering on my shoulders.
Well, you don't do it. I've got enough of you and your whole stupid outfit.
I'm sorry, Judd, I...
I didn't really mean what I said.
Sure glad.
I liked you the first day you walked into my house.
Wait a minute.
Hello?
Yes, Hale speaking.
Louisville?
Just a minute.
You wanna speak to June?
Can I?
Come here.
Hold that up to your ear.
Now, talk right in here.
What for?
Well, you wanna speak to June, don't you?
But you said she was in Louisville.
Well, that's where she is.
Hello, Pappy.
June.
Where are you hiding?
I'm not hiding, Pappy.
I'm in Louisville.
She says she's in Louisville.
Well, that's what
I told you.
Is this thing hollow all the way through?
Yeah, all the way through.
Well...
Hello, little brush rabbit.
You didn't, huh?
You know what your ma said this morning?
Operator?
Buddie!
Buddie is in there.
Buddie.
Pappy.
Jack.
Pappy!
Buddie! Buddie!
Buddie!
Buddie. Buddie.
Get me Dr. Owen, quick.
Get me some hot water.
Buddie.
Son. It's your pappy, Son.
Oh, God, don't let him die.
Don't take him away from my poor Melissa.
Buddie.
Buddie.
You may be the civiI law around here, but get this, interference with the public carriers, the railroad, I mean, that's a federaI offense.
It might have been an accident.
But it wasn't!
It was cold wanton murder!
They killed little Buddie!
They murdered him! A baby!
And I'm gonna put them where they rot.
Not for a murder, your heels are too smart for that.
And there's not a man in this town with courage enough to convict him.
But you're gonna make out a warrant on my charges!
You're gonna do what I say.
And you're gonna do everything I say.
Mr. Hale, I've lived in this country for more than 50 years.
I was born here, and I know these people.
I can bring the Falins to court. Maybe hang them.
But that don't stop feuds.
It makes them.
There'd be killings like we've never seen before.
Mountain people don't seem to like law, Mr. Hale.
Down here, peace has got to come from within.
It all seems kind of brutaI and primitive while it's a-boiling, but, well, I was born here and I know.
I'm talking honest,
Mr. Hale.
You know, I...
I cried when they told me
Buddie was killed.
Why, I used to ride miles out of my way to fetch him some stick candy.
But I like Jim Falin, too.
That was before you come here.
He's older than Buddie but just a kid.
Eyes always a-laughing.
He was
Buck's favorite son.
Dave Tolliver shot him.
Had reasons, I guess.
Or I could have cramped him in jaiI.
Yes, I could.
But did you ever get up close to
Melissa and look into her eyes?
Well, you do that sometime.
Then you tell me what kind of a law you can think of that will correct it.
Tell me...
June!
He couldn't just die, could he?
He had to be killed.
Killed by the Falin.
They did that.
He was my only brother.
And they killed him.
He ran down the hill with me before I went away.
He stood up there at the Lonesome Pine.
I never got to see him again.
I'm never going to see him again.
What are you doing here?
Why aren't you up there with Dave and Daddy?
You loved Buddie, didn't you?
You said you loved him.
He was gonna be an engineer.
Like you and Corsey.
When I tucked him in at night, he said,
" A is for apple, and I'll bet you I'll be as big as Mr. Hale. "
What are you doing here?
June.
You're down here with the law!
The law's gonna help you!
The laws gonna show you how it don't hurt.
When somebody you love...
When somebody you love...
Oh, June, darling, don't cry.
You mustn't cry.
Listen to me, dear.
I love you, and...
You love me?
You said you loved Buddie.
Why aren't you with Buddie?
Why aren't you where they need you?
You're here with the law.
You don't love me!
Well, I do with all of my heart.
You never said you love me before and I was hungry to hear it.
You said you love Buddie.
But you ain't doing nothing about it!
You ain't fighting!
You ain't killing!
That's what's coming to them! The Falins!
This is what you wanted me to be, ain't it?
Pretty, nice words, hollow words!
I don't want it!
I don't want you!
I don't want anything!
I don't want anything but the Falins!
Our Father who art in
Heaven, hallowed be thy name.
Thy Kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in Heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us.
Lead us not into temptation but deliver us from eviI.
For thine is the power and the glory forever and ever.
Amen.
When it's twilight on the trail
And I rest once more
My ceiling is the sky
And the grass
On which I lie
Is my floor
When it's twilight on the trail
And my voice is still
Please plant this heart of mine
Underneath the Lonesome Pine
On the hill
Oh, God, our Heavenly Father, we bow before thee in meekest humbleness leaving in thy divine wisdom and accepting with equaI humbleness the complexities of this life.
We are returning to the earth that which thou has produced.
A part of thy souI, of life eternaI.
There's just about eight of them, Judd.
Dominickers!
Looks like things is just born to the Tollivers.
Don't it, Melissa?
Sure seems.
What are we going to do?
What are we standing here for?
June, honey.
I'm not just gonna stand around any longer.
Be sensible.
Before green-up time, Dave.
That's what you want, isn't it?
You mean it?
It's gotta be somebody who acts like a Tolliver.
Is that what it's going to be?
Dave, I don't want you to go.
I ain't hating the Falins.
I ain't hating nobody.
I ain't grieving for Buddie.
June's my sorrow now.
I don't want to go on hating.
Don't go, David.
Dave...
Wait a minute.
Dave, you're not going to let him... Dave, listen.
You can't do this thing. You've got green-up time to think about.
You'll be getting married, then.
Now you're going out and run the risk of being killed.
Hasn't there been enough unhappiness in this house?
You ain't a Tolliver.
You're an outsider.
Yes. Well, none of you could have loved little Buddie any better than I did.
And he was killed because I taught him to love the things I did.
It was my fault.
And this matter of getting even is gonna be my business.
It's gonna be my business untiI
I've cleaned out every Falin that had anything to do with it.
Jack! Jack!
Dave.
I didn't want him to go.
I wouldn't have let you go, either.
I would have stopped you.
I only said those things
'cause I was hurt inside.
I could've stopped you.
But he's different.
He's not like a brother.
He'll never come back.
He'll never wanna come back.
Dave.
Stop him.
Tell him what I can't.
Please, Dave.
You ain't going to no Falins.
No? Well, you try and stop me.
You're looking for trouble, Mr.
Hale, the mountains is full of it.
We're all brave men.
Falins are brave men.
You killed the children.
I didn't know.
It's done now.
Sometime,
I'll wanna go downtown.
People, they'll look at me.
Maybe when I ain't around, they'll call me Herod.
Herod Falin.
They might call me that.
He was a fellow that done that once.
He killed babies.
The kid was a Tolliver, wasn't he?
You're kind of forgetting about Jim, ain't you?
I ain't forgetting nothing.
Jim told me, in my arms, he was hiding behind the bushes trying to pick off
Dave Tolliver, and Dave couldn't see who he was shooting at.
Buddie Tolliver couldn't say that.
I don't like him and
I ain't gonna like him.
I get my hands on that Dave Tolliver...
Who's that?
Dave Tolliver.
What are you here for?
I wanna talk to you.
And I ain't carry no gun.
Come on in.
If I tell you... If I tell you we're licked, will you stop fighting?
Who's licked?
Who do you mean?
Me.
You ain't licked.
You couldn't be licked.
Why did you come here?
Why?
Yeah.
Why shouldn't
I come to you?
I ought to have dragged myself through all the brambles, all the way from here up to your house, and say, " I'm sorry. "
But I just ain't got the sand.
You ain't my father.
You're a sniveling pup!
I've been like that.
Maybe that's what's the trouble.
You wanna shake hands?
Now, tell me, why did you do it?
It was Aunt Melissa's birthday...
For a minute
I thought you meant it.
I did. I did!
Dave, what happened?
I fell on my gun.
Buck Falin was passing.
He was good enough to fetch me home.
Dave.
If you don't mind, can I...
Can I stay till...
Sure.
It's of no use, Jack.
You can't cut this enough.
Dave.
Dave?
It'll soon be green-up.
And you'll have the biggest wedding in the whole country.
Won't he, June?
In the spring, David.
One for you, one for me.
Biggest wedding in...
When it's twilight on the trail
And my voice is still
Please plant this heart of mine
Underneath that Lonesome Pine
On the hill
Stand by for the mail.
We know you're not a pirate.
We know, you'll get your knife back when we dock in Singapore.
Say, you just get on a phone and call Scranton, PA...
- and ask anybody about J. Wilberforce...
- Have you any arms sir?
Just these you see growing out of me armpits.
You'll do.
No excuses Mr. Atkins, your job is to look after this dock.
If I ever find it in this state again, I'll, I'll...
How's your wife?
She's, she's very much better sir and thank you very much for the flowers.
Oh, don't thank me, my gardener has to get rid of them somehow.
Who's the big shot?
Sir Guy Wilmerding, managing director of the line.
Right this way Sir Guy.
Gangway please.
Glad to have you with us again sir.
Oh, none of that mush.
I know how glad you are.
Not bad, not bad at all for a synthetic stone.
- You ought to know Paul.
- My lovely Olga.
Hey, I bet that lug stops in China.
That's the insignia of Wing YuLan, everything in the archipelago pays dividends to him.
Good morning purser.
Good morning Miss YuLan.
We've made arrangements to take your chairs aboard in the after gangway.
Thank you.
Mr. Dawson sir, here comes the captain.
Look at him, with a 3 days hangover and watch him grouse.
Of all the ungrateful, brass hearted skippers of a rusty old teakettle... who thinks he's still strutting in the Royal Navy.
Our captain.
Oh Alan? Alan Gaskell? I got some last minute cargo for you.
Oh hello Ken, what you doing up in broad daylight?
Oh Captain Gaskell. I want you to meet
Charlie McCaleb, the American novelist.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
Well, Hong Kong seems to have taken you to her bottom again.
Now wait a minute,
I've seen your face before.
No, don't tell me, it's right on the tip of my tongue.
- Remember Johnson?
- Johnson?
- Who?
- Johnson.
Oh Johnny old boy, what you doing way out here?
- Oh, maybe you can tell me.
- No, no, this is Captain Gaskell.
- The master of the ship you're sailing on.
- Hiya captain, coming along with us?
Yes, yes, I'm afraid so.
He's supposed to be over here gathering material for a new novel, I've dragged him... through wars, riots and revolutions.
He doesn't even know he's in China.
If you should stir up anything exciting, why... shove him in a front seat and tie his eyes open.
Now, wait a minute, wait a minute,
I'm not running a day nursery... and I'm not stirring up any excitement just for the sake of literature, see you later.
Don't you worry old fella, I'll be right there, I'm the old Ringside Kid.
Got an eye like an eagle.
Goodbye Captain
Greshall, had a marvelous trip.
Ship ahoy, ship ahoy.
Ship ahoy.
- Are you all right Charley?
- I cover the waterfront.
- Steward.
- Yes sir? Good morning sir.
That's your idea of clean brass?
- Sorry sir...
- You haven't answered my question.
No sir, it isn't my idea clean brass sir.
You've been sampling my whiskey again, haven't you?
Oh, yes sir.
- Not as good as the last lot, is it?
- No sir.
Then why haven't you done something about it?
- I will sir.
- Thank you.
Thank you sir sir Guy wants to see you sir.
- Good morning captain.
- Good morning.
Ah, so there you are.
Good morning Mrs. Aiken.
We were just talking about you captain.
Mrs. Aiken tells me you've been sensationally blotto ever since you went ashore.
- Sir Guy?
- Oh, she does, eh?
You don't like my behavior ashore or aboard ship, you can get a new boy.
In fact, I wish you would.
- You wouldn't go if you could.
- Wouldn't I?
I'm so close to being back to
England now I can hear Big Ben chiming.
I've heard that from men for 50 years.
It's only the weak ones that sneak out of the China Seas.
It's the bullheads like you that stay on.
What about a little spot to keep your brain from addling?
No, I haven't the time.
I've got to get the pride of your fleet underway.
Mr. Rockwell, go to the captain's saloon, check those chronometers.
- Good morning sir.
- Good morning.
Third officer hasn't come aboard yet sir.
Yes, I know, I've just been looking him over, he's in the Sepoy Hospital.
Tried to clean out
High Spade McQueen's last night.
- Bad sir?
- Yes, knife in the kidneys.
Port captain is trying to find someone to replace him.
- What you got in your mouth?
- Chewing tobacco sir.
It's bad enough to have a ship like this and a captain that looks like... me without having a chief officer who looks like you.
I'm sorry sir.
Had it in me jaw when I came on duty and I forgot all about it.
Oh Mr.Willet of the Royal
Canada Bank is awaiting to see you sir.
- He's just down there at your quarters.
- Thank you.
- Hello Willet.
- Good morning captain.
- Gold come aboard yet?
- Yes sir.
- All stowed away as we agreed?
- In the steamroller.
- Good.
- Thank you sir.
Wipe that smile off your face.
Is that your idea of clean brass?
You haven't answered my question.
Did I ask you?
A little too big for you, isn't it Mr. Rockwell?
I apologize sir.
Chief officer sent me down to check the chronometers.
Yeah.
- But I don't keep them in my cap.
- No sir.
- What you going to do with that button?
- To button it sir.
I was just hoping you weren't too angry with me sir.
- Oh, carry on.
- Thank you sir.
Excuse me sir.
- Who's in there?
- It's China Doll, a gal that drives men mad.
What the devil are you doing aboard?
Nothing lambie, just showering the dewdrops off the body beautiful.
How many hours do we have to spend saying goodbye before it takes?
That's just the trouble toots, it took too good.
Gee, were sweet to me.
Say, I thought maybe you could use all that money you won at the Tai Fan last night.
Oh, then we were there?
Yeah, we had a million laughs.
I made 17 straight passes myself.
- Get on your horse, we're shoving off.
But why you so anxious to get me out of here?
Is that hunk of caviar making the round trip?
What hunk of caviar?
That red headed Russian princess whose aboard from Singapore.
She isn't a Russian and she isn't a princess... and I have my doubts about her hair being red.
I don't care what she is, if she was a
Chinese sextet, it'd be the same thing to me.
What I'm trying to get through your numb skull is that I'm not going to stand by...
Now, wait a minute Dolly.
You and I are friends.
We had a lot of fun together.
And as far as I'm concerned, you're a number one girl in the archipelago.
But I don't remember making any vows to you nor do I recall asking for any.
Don't you get polite at me, when you start talking with your high hat on I...
I know you mean it and and scares me.
Say, who do you think you are anyway?
- If I had a nickel's worth of pride...
- Alright.
That's the way you feel about, I'm not standing in your way.
That's just the soup I'm in,
I don't feel that way at all.
You, you dog.
Oh, that's more like it.
Come in.
- Pilot tug's alongside sir.
- Alright.
Stand by to single up your lines fore and aft.
Aye, aye sir.
Alright, come on now nuisance, over shore.
Oh but I'm looking, what I'm going to do with my ticket? It's all paid for and everything.
And I knew you'd something up your sleeve.
Alright, come on, we'll get your money back.
No but I got a job in Singapore.
- Honest...
- Oh yes, yes, I know.
I suppose they've elected you mayor.
No but it's on the level, Hoffmann sent me a contract for the rest of the season.
No.
Look, I know how you feel about it.
I won't come near you. Nobody will...
No.
Alright toots, you, you win, I...
I hope you have a good trip, goodbye.
Alright, alright, if you've got your ticket and a job, I don't suppose I...
- Lambie.
- Stop wrestling me around.
You turning this skiff into an excursion launch.
Come on, snap into it before the fore hold loading.
You just came down to say goodbye?
You brought enough of your cigarettes to last on a voyage to New York.
Oh I'll smoke a lot more cigarettes than that toots, before we ever really say goodbye.
Listen, I told you to...
- Good morning sir.
- Davids, isn't it? Tom Davids?
Yes sir.
Your port captain told me to report for duty as 3rd officer.
- Duty as what?
- Third officer.
These rocking chair sailors ashore.
Here I am in the middle of the typhoon season, a tough voyage ahead.
I ask for a fighter, and they send me a punching bag.
Give me a chance, is the first one I had for over a year.
I know these waters better than most, I've sailed them as a master for over 10 years.
No one had a better record on this coast than I had.
Then, just because of an accident, I'm not a coward.
Stow it Davids, you let pirates scuttle your ship... and you lost every white man aboard except yourself.
The board of trade lifted your ticket, I didn't.
Give me a chance please.
You got a uniform?
Nothing clean sir.
Alright, I'll have the steward give you one of mine.
- Yes sir.
- Report to Mr. Dawson.
I'll have the uniform laundered and return it to you.
No, that's all right.
Keep it, you probably need it.
Thank you sir.
Well, if it ain't old rough on rat himself, how are you, Jamesy?
Dolly, you're looking just as pretty as ever, what you've been doing?
- Bidding the big boy goodbye, eh?
- Goodbye nothing, I'm making this voyage.
- No, you're not.
- Yeah.
Why, I'm just as happy as if
I'd won the Calcutta sweepstakes.
You ought to have the shekels piled up to the roof by now.
I haven't done so bad, you know...
Dolly, I'm still willing to share it all with you.
Say, there ain't enough dough in all Asia to make me change the way I feel about one guy.
Still crazy about that Gaskell, eh?
Well, whenever you get tired of running around with an Airedale... and you want to run around with a
Saint Bernard, why, you let me know.
Sure, whenever I get lost in the Alps, I'll whistle for you.
- Alright, I'll come running, goodbye Dolly.
- See you later.
- You'd be easy with them there pigs.
- Well Kingston, you're a wonder.
How you've been able to sail with that... sour bellied Gaskell as long as you have, I don't know.
- Hello Jamesy.
- Well Captain Gaskell, I was just telling...
Kingston how happy I was to be sailing with you.
- Hey, stow that on the port side.
- Yes, yes.
You still carrying that cargo of soft soap, eh?
No, no, really, I mean it. You don't know what a safe feeling it is to be... sailing with a captain that's never been raided by the pirates.
Yes, there's not much profit for pirates in this zoo of yours.
Say, who you swindling with this scrubby lot, eh?
That's the finest lot of animals I've ever shipped.
Well, they're not as noisy as that last batch of sopranos you had.
Say now, Jamesy, just between you and me.
- What do you give them to keep them quiet?
- I just give them one of these little pills.
And they sleep and dream all the way across, never lose a pound.
I don't suppose you ever thought of giving them a little... gravel just to add a pound though.
Why captain, that would be dishonest.
They got big feet for singsong girls, haven't they?
Well they, they don't bandage the feet nowadays, these are enlightened days.
Those feet are big even for enlightened days.
- Captain Gaskell sir.
- Sir Rockwell.
What is a woman do when you throw something at her?
- A woman?
- She dodges it, a man catches it.
Here, catch. Sergeant of guard.
Take them to shore, charge them with attempted piracy.
And ask the police commissioner to wireless me anything he can sweat out them.
Hido, Hido.
You go ashore and tell Moray to bail them out before they start to talk.
Tell Ngah I'll go through with the job as agreed but he'll need more men, go on.
Hey captain, that's good work.
You're the finest skipper on this coast.
Thanks.
- See you on the next trip.
- Goodbye and thank you for all your trouble.
- Take care of yourself dear.
- I will.
- So long Sybil and good luck.
- Thank you so much.
- B-39.
- Thank you.
- Don't forget to write Sybil.
- I won't.
- Sybil?
- Alan?
It is Alan.
Oh, so this is your ship. My, I am lucky.
Yes, yes, I'm captain of this tub.
Are you visiting out here?
Just traveling.
You might start to unpack Pether.
I've been just traveling for some time.
I, I heard about Bart, I meant to write, but it was so long after he died.
News is slow out here.
We spoke of you so often, wondering what you were doing.
Oh, getting into trouble mostly, then trying to get out of it.
Well, you're in for more trouble now, looking after me for a whole voyage.
I'm in your hands again Alan.
Look here Alan, can't you get this boat? What's wrong?
- Look as if you'd seen a ghost.
- I have.
- Gangplank secure sir.
- All clear forward sir.
- Cast off your bow line.
- Aye, aye sir.
Good morning captain.
- Hiya neighbor, the name is Timmons.
- Ah, I can take it or leave it alone.
No, no, the name, Timmons.
T - I - M - M - O - N - S.
I'm the guy that can do it too.
Who is it?
- Who is it?
- It's just me toots.
Listen, when I told you to stay out of here, I wasn't shadowboxing, I meant it.
- Oh, I just came in to borrow a book.
- I don't keep them in my bathtub.
I decided to improve my mind.
You better take two books, give yourself an even break.
Now, how about you doing about 3 turns around the deck... before dinner just to work up an appetite, eh?
Ok, Ok toots. I know you ain't got much time to fool around with passengers.
- It's your own fault, you wanted to be one.
- Except maybe that English dame.
- You're becoming very observant.
- I saw her when she came aboard.
She looked like she was smelling a dead fish or something.
Considering her surroundings that's highly possible.
And I also got a load of you when you moved her into the royal suite.
Why didn't you lay out a red plush carpet for her?
Well, that's just a throwback to my old manners.
The lady happened to know me when
I acted that way for the sheer joy of it.
Oh, I get it, a hometown honey.
I knew her years ago and her husband.
Married? Oh, being married don't seem to tie her down none.
He's dead.
So, so she's back in circulation again.
Well, maybe it's a good thing you didn't get hooked up with nobody out here.
Thanks but if I'd had a more definite tie,
I might've behaved a bit more decently.
Say, if you ain't decent boyfriend, you'll do until something decent comes along.
Out here maybe.
But anywhere else in the world we'd both be a little bit soiled.
Did you ever see an English river Dolly?
No, I'm dumb at geography, just like I am at everything else.
Well, it's cool, clear and clean.
Put a stream like that alongside any river out here, dirty, yellow, muddy... you'll see the difference.
That was only a few years ago.
The pirates killed every white person aboard except the Capt and then scuttled the ship.
Better take care of these pearls in the case of piracy.
Why? They're artificial, they're not worth anything.
12 and a half bucks, quite a bargain I'd say.
Where did you get them Mr. Timmons?
- Well, she picked them up...
- I bought them myself in Tokyo.
Well you know, it's not always easy to tell the real from...
- I'm sure you didn't pay too much for them.
- Bet your sweet life she didn't.
That little woman gets her money's worth every time, eh Poopsie?
Hey, you see that chess game over there?
When I was 4 years old, I played
10 people all at once, blindfolded.
I lost every game.
Pirates? Baloney.
Where did you really get those pearls, eh?
- You won't tell Wilbur, will you?
- Twelve and a half bucks to Wilbur.
That pirate hooey of yours is stuff they always tell tourists.
I'll bet they don't rate one through nine with our rum-runners.
Bosh, your rum-runners learned the game from our pirates.
Even the hijacking and that trick of identifying each other... by matching the halves of a torn a hundred dollar bill.
- Here they use a hundred pound note.
- Sunday paper bunk.
- Hey mate, come here.
- Yes sir?
- How are you Mr. Davids?
- How are you Sir Guy?
Tell him that bunk about the ship they held up and scuttled.
Get a load of this, it's terrific.
- I don't remember saying anything Timmons.
- You can't get out of it like that.
Tell him about the one white officer who came out of it alive.
What's the matter with that bird?
Was I speaking out of turn?
I'm afraid you were, that's Tom Davids.
Captain of the ship I was telling you about.
Say, don't look now, well I think my stomach is full of butterflies.
Isabelle.
- Isabel MacCarthy.
- Yes ma?
Would you say that I looked like a lady?
No Miss Dolly, I've been with you all too long to insult you that-away.
Say, what's the difference?
What's that snooty
English dame got that I ain't?
She's more refined like.
She would never wear that dress with all them shiny beads you got.
That dress is more my type.
You've been hinting for that dress for a month.
Go on and take it, you spoiled it for me anyway.
You sure got the right feeling though honey.
I got to let this out a smidgen.
You sure is got the right instincts no matter what they all say.
What do they say?
Oh, it's just a mite of talk, they say yous got yourself so hooked on to that...
Captain Gaskell that he's shaking himself like a wet hound dog... and can't get you loose no how.
Yes Miss, they do, like a wet hound dog.
He can't shake me off, I hopped off, see?
And I'm glad I did, do you hear that?
I'm glad, I'm happy.
Sure you's happy honey.
But don't you worry, you'll get over it.
Twenty years on the China Seas and she never lost a spangle.
I had a spangle once, it was a cockier spangle.
She had a litter of field mice.
Good evening Miss Portland, I've got you the other side of Mr. MacArdle.
- Oh well, I get it, where is the big guy?
- You mean the captain miss?
He went, that is I believe he's escorting Mrs. Barclay.
Oh, why doesn't she put a ring in his nose so she can lead him around easier?
Excuse me sir.
Say, Ah Feng, bring me a double hooker of scotch quick.
Yes miss.
Well Jamesy, you old trambo, long time no see kid.
No fault of mine Dolly, you're the original one man girl..
As long as I've got a one gal guy.
I just saw Captain Gaskell upstairs walking with Mrs. Barclay.
Very lovely looking girl, isn't she?
She couldn't take me away from a girl like you in a thousand years.
Hey, what makes you think she's taking anything away from me, eh?
Get on the belt line and keep them coming.
I think you know everybody Sybil, except perhaps Miss YuLan, Mrs. Barclay.
How do you do?
- And Miss Portland.
- How do you do?
Hello.
You needn't be so confoundedly possessive
Alan I knew Mrs. Barclay long before you did.
Say, you had such a start.
I'm only trying to catch up.
Ah, you had your chance
Sir Guy but you spurned me.
At least Alan didn't meet me till after I was married.
That ruins all my guesses.
I had such a romantic meeting arranged for you two.
The squadron ball at Gibraltar, music, lanterns, uniforms...
Her husband was at sea so I claimed every dance.
- We walked back to the hotel together.
- With or without moonlight?
Oh, there was a harvest moon.
You've never seen a moon until you've watched the one over China Seas.
It'll be full by the time we get to Singapore.
Oh glorious.
Say, speaking of meetings Jamesy, do you remember that night in that putang joint... in Saigon when you and me met up with a certain party?
Oh, do I.
There wasn't any moon but he had a shiner on his left eye that lit up the whole street.
A cut on his right leg, why he'd bled to death if it hadn't been for China Doll here.
- My, that was a romantic meeting.
- She saved his life.
And never got a word of thank for it, I'll be darned.
I wish I could tell you what she said when I tried it.
You never used to be so particular about your language.
That's right Dolly.
This will be an awful comedown after the Royal Mail.
Oh, I don't know, there's something very real and dramatic about this atmosphere.
You know, pirates and machine guns, barricades...
Mr. McCaleb, I want you to meet a literary rival of yours Mrs. Barclay.
Oh, good evening Mr. McCaleb.
Thanks, I've got all the insurance I can handle.
And Mrs. Barclay, I'm sure I saw you in London two years ago.
Why, of course Miss Yu-LAN, it was at the American Embassy... and then again at the Gainsboroughs' in Sussex.
Peg, isn't she the most amazing hostess?
It was only two years before that I...
Too amazing for words, there I was, with a cinder in me eye as large as a paving block.
With the grand duke on one side of me and the marquis on the other... both trying to get pull my top lid over my bottom.
Miss Portland is a professional entertainer.
No, I am lady or you'd like me to try something else.
No, I'm afraid you haven't anything left for an encore.
So you think it's funny, eh?
What are you grinning at?
- You must be very fond of him.
- What makes you think so?
To humiliate yourself like this.
I'll see you later Alan.
Don't worry, he knows where the royal suite is and... so do I, I had it the first time I sailed on this ship.
The more violent the storm, the sooner it subsides.
When I want you to sound off, golden bells, I'll pull your rope.
I, I apologize for this exhibition, it's all my fault.
And as the man said when they were about to hang him, this will be a lesson to me.
Madam chairman and ladies of this literary group... it is with sentiments of profound respect that I address you this afternoon.
Because woman is the mother of all literature, I thank you.
Hey look, I'm awful sorry I blew up. Honest, I am.
But hookers of scotch and the fact that
I'm so fighting nuts about you, I can...
You saved me a lot of trouble, you painted the whole dirty picture... for her with a nice, truthful brush, thanks.
Gee toots, don't talk to me like that.
I get scared when you put the freeze on me.
Look, I'll go to her...
- apologize, do anything in the world you...
- You keep as far away from her as you can.
And farther away from me.
Come.
- Captain Gaskell sir.
- Well, what's wrong Mr. Rockwell?
Your navigation chart...
Excuse me sir, this navigation problem sir, I'm having trouble with it.
- Trouble?
- Yes sir.
Yes, I should say you are.
If your figures are correct Mr. Rockwell this ship is in the middle of the Sahara Desert.
Yes sir, it has me worried sir.
Yes.
Well, suppose you try adding here instead of subtracting.
Perhaps that'll put us back in the ocean again.
Yes sir, thank you sir.
- Alright.
- Excuse me sir.
How's it toots?
Well, go on and play dumb if you want to, I just came in to... tell you I'm not going to come around and pester you anymore.
Look.
I'm taking all my cigarettes.
You know, it's moonlight outside. Gee, it's pretty.
Ain't it funny, we always fight when it's moonlight and make up when it's raining?
It's about time for the rainy season, ain't it toots?
Ah, come on out of the trenches, I'm not going to throw any bombs, I'm harmless.
Yes, of course, you're as harmless as a revolution.
Well, don't forget your cigarettes.
I won't, I know an exit line when I hear one.
Well, anyway, it won't be so lonely while Jamesy is aboard.
I hate to hear you talk like that Dolly.
Well, a gal is got to do the best she can with what's around.
You owe yourself more than that.
The trouble is boyfriend, there ain't any male Mrs. Barclay, so charming, so refined.
The real trouble is there aren't enough female Mrs. Barclay.
Don't give it another thought Alan.
You know, I once hoped you'd know me very well but not that well.
But when you once hoped, you, you weren't in this part of the world.
No, that's true but here I am.
- Yes?
- Captain Gaskell.
Mr. MacArdle wants to go forward to look after his animals.
No MacArdle can't look at his animals.
I wouldn't let an admiral go forward without a guard.
You find it an exciting part of the world, don't you?
Exciting? Nursing and cursing a bunch of leftovers who are supposed to be officers... derelicts for a crew?
But ashore, the glamor of...
Yes, you saw me this morning after a trip ashore, did I look particularly glamorous?
Well, I wasn't thinking of backgrounds.
- That girl, she's glamorous, surely.
- Sybil, I don't deny her.
But you know why I came out here, why I resigned from the service.
- It's all I could do.
- Yes, we...
I might've cracked up
Bart's life if you'd stayed.
Sybil.
If I thought there was the slightest chance, I...
I'd stumble out with everything
I wanted to say six years ago, I...
Alan, I have a confession to make.
I'm not just traveling,
I followed a memory, traced you here.
And now that I've found you,
I don't care how you've lived.
I'll always be in love with you.
I'll jump ship at Singapore.
We'll dig up a magistrate or a chaplain.
A Buddhist monk, if there's none other. We'll go back together.
Oh, England.
I've a place in Sussex with a fireplace you can stand in.
Your cocoa sir.
Oh, yes, yes, yes.
Come in old man, come right in.
What's the matter? What happened to you?
The chef is been at the vanilla extract again sir.
Wait for me with a cleaver.
A cleaver is a new matter sir.
Ah yes. Well, give him a quart of brandy to taper off on, he be alright in the morning.
Sybil, I want you to meet the best chief steward in the line, Ted Gary.
Honest as the day is long.
And he said to Mrs. Barclay, right in front of me, I was the best steward in the line.
Honest as the day is long.
And never a word about that last bottle of whiskey I pinched.
No doubt, the old man is going soft.
Relieved me right in the middle of me watch so I could come to breakfast.
Called me Bertie.
I had a chew of tobacco in my mouth as big as that and he never even noticed.
And he said he'd take me to the races ashore.
Well...
That's the way it is with those two bottle men, I've never seen it fail.
- All of a sudden...
- I knew a man once in Liverpool that way.
Davids.
- Aren't you going to wait for your coffee?
- No.
- It's too stuffy here.
- And smelly too.
May I please have the sugar sir?
Thank you.
Mark.
- Good.
- Lovely shot.
That's a lovely gun.
I hope that they don't leave them laying around loose.
Captain lock them up all the time we no use.
- That's good.
- Mark.
- Hiya.
- Ah, good morning.
- Good morning.
- Oh, good morning.
I guess she's still burned.
Mark.
I got it then.
I'm afraid you're much too consistent for me Mrs. Barclay.
Oh, not at all.
Mark.
I received your note, really wasn't necessary.
Oh, I'm sorry I acted so crazy.
Say Jamesy, how about you and me starting a little competition for the common people, eh?
- Alright, I, I'll bet you a shilling.
- Ok.
Bring us a gun.
There you are.
Are you and Captain Gaskell going to make your home in Singapore or Hong Kong?
Oh, I don't think we're going to stay out here at all.
Did you hear what she said?
It's all over the ship that they're going to get married... the minute they get into Singapore.
- That's why Gaskell is turned sunny side up.
- Mark.
I think you're very wise not to stay in the Orient.
We have a saying out here...
After the cheap, strong wine, the most delicate tea has little flavor.
- Oh, be careful.
- Oh, I'm sorry, I...
Quite all right, you had no idea the gun was loaded.
Oh, you don't think I pointed it at you on purpose, do you?
There's nothing to think about Miss Portland.
The gestures of a woman like you simply do not exist.
Mark.
It's beautiful the way these ducks know how to throw the old harpoon.
That's one of the advantages of a very fine cosmopolitan education.
Come on Jamesy, let's you and me take a powder.
Clay pigeons, that's the thrilling sort of life you're headed for in England Alan.
Shooting clay pigeons, eh?
Exactly and whether you believe it or not, I'll revel in it.
Greetings boyfriend.
Well I, I understand congratulations are in order.
I'd like to be the first to wish you the best, you'll need it.
One day, you'll say something nice and never forgive yourself.
Look toots, I...
Oh gee, I don't blame you for being sore,
I know I've done a lot of stupid gabbing... but this is on the level, I wish you all the luck.
And that's one baby you'll never have... to be ashamed of. She's the real McCoy and she'll make a... a marvelous wife for you.
- I wish you meant that.
- I do.
Well, well, that's better.
Now, let's quit good friends, instead of like a couple of cabdrivers after a drunken brawl.
Yeah, I guess that's the way it ought to be done.
But I ain't been brought up to do the right thing like that English dame.
All I can say is what's down inside of me.
And I don't care how long you've been carrying the torch for her.
You can't quit me any more than I can quit... you and you can kiss a stack of cookbooks on that.
- Thank you.
- Well, anyway it'll be quieter in England.
- Wait till you get there, if you ever do.
- What's to keep me?
Well, I've been trying it for 30 years, there's something about this place.
From my windows I can see the whole harbor of Hong Kong.
Big ships coming, big ships going, the
China I know, the China I've helped to make.
And on quiet nights, off in the hills,
I can hear the sound of distant firing.
They were at it when I came and they'll be at it after I've gone.
More guns won't stop them too many of them.
And the only things they respect are courage and honor.
Yes and England's power, England's place here... can never be any greater than the men who represent her.
They might be able to use an
Englishman at home sometime, you know.
Oh, I was hoping that someday you'd take my place.
- I had me eye on you for a long time.
- Well, take it off.
I'm quitting the
China Seas as soon as we dock.
Well, if you're...
- in earnest?
- Dead earnest.
I'd better be looking for somebody to take your command, eh?
What about Dawson?
Dawson? Take my ship?
I've always heard you speak highly of him.
Yes. Yes, of course I speak highly of him.
Dawson is one of the best.
Absolutely, you couldn't do better.
Dawson?
I never forget a name or a face, now, I've seen you somewhere before.
You've seen me a dozen times a day since...
No, don't tell me, don't tell me, it's on the tip of my tongue.
The name is Timmons,
T - I - M - M - O - N - S.
How do you pronounce that?
Timmons, Timmons, Timmons, T- I - M - M...
I thought he said Timmons.
I drink to the health of Admiral Puff.
My compliments to Mr. Dawson.
- Tell him I'll be up on the bridge shortly.
- I drink to the health of Admiral Puff.
Whoopee, are you good Jamesy?
- Attaboy Jamesy.
- You called sir?
What? Oh, yes, yes. See that all the staterooms and portholes are secured.
- We're in for a blow.
- Will it be a real storm Alan? Terrifying?
All seas aren't alike, can't tell much more.
I did hope for your sake, though, it'd be an easy trip.
That's too much to expect from the China Seas.
Attaboy...
Anything else sir?
What? Yes.
Might tell them that anybody that can't hold his or her liquor... better lay off until this blows is over.
I'm afraid you're a good influence on him Sybil and I deplore it.
- Alright, here we go again.
- I beg your pardon.
Here's to the health of
Admiral Puff Puff Puff, three times.
- Ok?
- Perfect.
- I think you did one bounce too many.
- Ah, she was all right.
I had my eye on her just like a hawk.
My dear fellow, what do you suppose I was doing?
Oh, there's two against one, two against one.
Captain says the weather is blowing up, a word to the wise.
Come on Jamesy, we're off again.
Greatest game in the world, that makes men remember and women forget.
I'll play this game until you can't remember anything but your little Jamesy.
Here's to the health of Admiral Puff three times.
Keno, you forgot to say
Admiral Puff Puff Puff.
Oh, doggone it anyway, I...
- Drink up sir and start all over again.
- Come on, down the hatch.
Ah, don't look so sad toots, you doing swell.
Have you ever noticed Sir Guy, that a man is never angry with a woman he doesn't like?
- I had not, until now.
- Me either.
And I shall be more pleasant to her after this, shall we?
Good evening skipper, how's the barometer doing?
- Falling to a new low.
- Well, don't let that worry you captain.
Say, where you been keeping yourself stranger?
Have breakfast with me in the morning, if you can eat anything.
I'll be there, nothing takes my appetite.
Say, how about joining the game that kills all care?
Oh, I'm afraid it would kill me too, good night.
Kill nothing, all you need is a wooden, hollow leg to play this game.
Here's to the health of Admiral...
- Prosit.
- Prosit.
Missed out again Jamesy, sock it down boy.
It's thickening up like mud sir, we're running right into it.
Running into it? We're in it already.
Why don't you keep her on her course?
What you trying to do?
Write your name in the ocean?
Old man is getting back to normal, good thing with this coming on.
Put your oilskins on and get to your stations, stick her nose right into it.
Yes sir.
Mr. Davids, tell the steward to look out for his passage...
- better get life belts on them.
- Yes sir.
- Exciting sir, isn't it? My first typhoon.
- Really?
Well, if you live long enough you may see another one sometime.
- Get to your station.
- Yes sir.
Excuse me sir.
Chief, keep up a full head of steam, we're in for a twister.
Good old Grandfather.
Don't get panicky, just stick by me.
Hey, stop showing off, come on up here.
Come on lady, slip into this.
I really shouldn't you know, with my figure.
Tie it up in the front.
Let me help you miss.
You've lost your pearls.
No, I, I broke the string Mr.Romanoff has them.
Yes, yes, I will restring them for her as soon as we get out of this.
Oh, I never want to see them again.
Throw them away, do anything you please.
Oh, if we only come out of this alive.
Now, now, Poopsie, don't let a little wind blow you off your feet.
Have you seen Miss Portland sir?
- Isn't she in her cabin?
- No.
By Jove, if she went out on deck in the condition she was in...
You all, you all don't suppose she's been washed overboard?
Can't find Miss Portland sir, afraid she may have been washed overboard.
- Keep your hand to it.
- Aye, aye sir.
- Where's MacArdle?
- His door is locked sir.
- Why didn't you break it down?
- Was afraid to without orders.
That's the game, you old beachcomber,
I beat you, you hear that? I won.
Prosit.
Hey, that's the typhoon, that's the typhoon Jamesy.
Come on, give me the other 20 you owe me, come on.
Ah, quit stalling Jamesy, and give me that 20 you owe me.
Alright, if you won't give it to me, I'll take it.
What a twister that was.
Hello Dolly.
Well, where you going?
Winners always go home, don't they?
What's the idea of locking the door?
- Caveman stuff, eh?
- Oh no, it's...
- It's just a force of habit Dolly.
- Say, are you trying to insult me?
Did I ever take anything that wasn't coming to me?
Why darling, you, you know that you could have anything that I've got, anytime.
- Now, come on you, fork that over.
- Alright welsher.
There's £200 that I won and I won on the level, if you ain't a good enough sport...
No, you don't, you know what I'm talking about.
You know what I mean.
You know, it's pretty stormy out there and you never know when you might wash overboard.
- Say, are you threatening me?
- Dolly, you've seen it.
- I haven't.
- I tell you, you've seen it.
I haven't, I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm talking about that half of the £100 note that you just took from my wallet.
I don't know what you're saying but I'll forget you ever said anything.
Dolly, it would do you no good to double cross me.
- Oh, this is a hanging matter.
- I don't want to hear another word.
If it was anybody else but you, I'd chuck you overboard.
But I'm so crazy about you it's eating my insides out.
- You're in with me.
- I don't want to be, I...
Dolly, you're in with me, there's a quarter of a million pounds of gold on this ship.
Your share will make you a rich woman.
We can go anywhere, do anything.
Look, I'm no good to you.
- What do you want with me?
- Because you're a smart girl.
You're smart enough to hide that note, you're smart enough to know what it means.
- Yeah, I'm smart enough to stay out of this.
- Even as much as I love you... you're in with me from now on or else...
I'm going to break that pretty little neck of yours just like...
- The marines have landed.
- I'm sorry to interrupt.
Dolly and I were just sealing a little partnership... which I hope she'll never have cause to regret.
Perhaps you better do your sealing in the main salon where there's lot more witnesses.
Maybe you're right captain.
Look out.
- Hold her.
- That was a near thing Alan.
Dawson.
- Get some lines, lash this down.
- Come here with that line.
Hey, come here.
- Cold darling?
- Yeah, yeah, cold, that's it.
You with me?
- It's a tough ocean to try and swim in.
- That's a good girl.
Now, you keep miles away from that fella Gaskell or...
I might think that you're trying to double-cross me.
Captain Gaskell, the steamroller is loose sir.
It'll mash those coolies like a lot of turnips.
Oh, the poor devils.
Let it go overboard.
Come on.
Close up that rail.
Davids, lend a hand.
Get the tarps off those winches.
Alright, turn on the steam.
Go to your quarters, you're under arrest.
Well, what do you want?
I want to thank you sir, for saving my life sir.
- Oh, go to bed.
- Is it all over sir?
Yeah, we'll stand regular watch from now on.
Mr. Kingston, what time do you come on watch?
- Eight bells sir.
- You're one minute late.
I'm sorry sir.
Keep her half speed and make your repairs on the port engine.
Aye, aye sir.
- Davids is here sir.
- Yes.
Alright.
I know what I'd do with him if this was my ship.
Well, wait till you get a ship.
Mr. Davids...
Yes sir.
Mr. Davids, for the rest of this voyage, you'll be relieved of... duty and confined to your quarters in arrest.
When we reach port, I'll have to turn you in to the board of trade... for neglect of duty and disobedience of orders.
I don't blame you sir.
But it's funny somehow, during the year I've been on the beach...
I've prayed every day for a chance.
And then when I got it, I couldn't make good.
I'm just a washout, that's all.
I'm sorry Davids.
- Call me when you relieve the watch.
- Yes sir.
This will cost you your ticket.
It's me toots, I've been waiting for you to come off watch.
Get out of here.
Look, I got a mighty good reason for being here.
You've always got a good reason for anything you're doing.
In fact, I don't know anybody who could think up any... more remarkable good reasons than you can on short notice.
Listen to me toots, I took an awful chance coming here.
- I might have got heaved overboard.
- Well, don't run any more risk by staying.
- Get off on the rest of your rounds.
- Toots, you got to listen to me.
- I only came here for one thing.
- I'm quite aware of that.
You're always waiting for a sailor, to comfort him... as only a woman like you can comfort a man who's too tired or too drunk to care who is.
Toots, don't be like that, if you keep that up you got to talk yourself right out of...
I hope so.
Oh, you hope so, do you?
Well, you've been begging for it, now you're going to get it.
You won't be so high and mighty when I get through with you.
You just wait, I'll fix you, you'll be lower than a coolie, you'll be lower than Davids.
You'll come crawling to me on your knees.
I warned you not to double cross me.
You said you could use the gun.
Well darling, you're a marvel.
You're a real partner.
You know, I thought that you was going...
What is it matter what you thought I was going to do? You got what you wanted.
Ah, don't take it so hard Dolly.
Oh, take what too hard?
I got what I wanted too.
I guess.
Sparks, Sparks.
Look out sir Malays.
Oh look, they're bringing them right now.
Got a cigarette Jamesy?
I thought you said nobody get hurt.
You can't expect the boys to stand there... and take it after someone cuts loose at them, can you?
- I must've been crazy, stark staring crazy.
- Take it easy, take it easy.
Be careful.
What you hiding those pearls for?
They do not worth anything.
I don't want to lose them.
You're perfectly right my dear, I've been through one of these things before.
They take everything in sight.
Something funny about those pearls, I'm going to have... appraised when we get to Singapore.
Wilbur, don't be insane.
Every one of those guns came out of our arsenal.
- Our arsenal sir?
- Yes.
I don't see how they could've broken down the steel door.
An-may in the ife-lay oat-bay.
- Davids.
- Yes Dawson.
- No savvy Malay.
- Do you?
Not enough but MacArdle does, I'm sure.
Hey look here, don't any of these fellows speak English?
No savvy.
Now, isn't that just too bad? Oh, that's terrible.
Yes.
Look here, whoever you are, in that lifeboat out there... there are some mills bombs in the seat locker in my quarters.
Yeah, if you're not too badly hurt watch your chance and try and get them.
I'll hold them here as long as I can.
- No savvy.
- No savvy?
There's your chance Mr. Dawson.
- And get those bombs.
- He's crazy, what's the use?
- I'd only be shot at.
- Yes.
I understand Mr. Dawson.
Get out of my way.
As far as I can make out, he comes from a very royal family and is very sorry to...
- disturb you like this.
- Why, no disturbance at all.
He wishes to assure you that no one will be harmed.
If you will open the strongbox... he'll willingly take the gold and depart with only the friendliest feelings toward you.
- Open the safe.
- Yes sir.
You haven't lost your ticket ye, old man.
If you want me to, I'll be only too glad to put in a good word for you.
Where's Alan? You don't think they'll hurt him, do you?
No, no, of course not, my dear, no.
No, they need the captain healthy.
I'm sorry Poopsie, looks like that guy did the appraising.
Why that's sand, you're pretty smart Gaskell.
Well, apparently the bank patronized some other line.
You can't fool these Malays with an old trick like the boxes of sand.
Why, whoever is at the head of this gang is got brains.
They know when there's gold on board a ship.
Why, their spies tell them about every shipment... of gold that leaves any bank in Hong Kong.
Listen MacArdle, make it clear to him.
If there was any gold aboard, he could have it and welcome.
Listen man, I'm talking to you as though I'm your own brother.
Save yourself while there's still time.
Look here, that's my skipper, you can't...
Looks as if the party came too late.
Why, it's the boot, the Malay boot.
- Why, that's cruel torture.
- Size is 9C.
Why, you're not going to let him torture you?
Have you any suggestions?
- Is that the latest style?
- Don't let them do that man.
Why, you'll never be able to use your...
- foot again.
- Listen Jamesy, you're a fast talker.
Better one I've ever seen, tell him something, tell him anything.
Tell him the bank fooled me as much as it did him.
I've talked my head off, he won't listen.
Tell him where it is, I can't bear it.
It's killing me to stand here and not be able to help you.
- I can't bear it.
- Well, put your fingers in your ears.
Stubborn half-wit.
- Gaskell, my boy Gaskell.
- Don't start counting, I'm getting up.
Please tell them where it is Gaskell.
Why, it's breaking my heart to see you suffer like this.
There can't be any gold, he would've talked.
Nobody could be that tough.
Come on, club out.
Die you...
Oh, you poor boy, you.
I made them understand there's no gold here.
It was Jamesy that saved your poor feet for you.
Are they gone?
Yes, it's all right, they're getting into the junk.
Here, take it easy, there's nothing you can do. Here Gaskell.
Davids.
- Davids.
- Davids.
Shut your mouth.
- I got the bombs.
- Good, good, let me have this one.
Keep clear while I blow my way out.
And thanks Davids.
Can you make it over and heave it in that junk?
I'll try.
Davids, remember after you pull the pin, you only got five seconds until it goes off.
- You're crazy, you'll get us all killed.
- Get back.
One.
Two.
Three.
Four.
Hey, a little less noise please.
Captain Gaskell?
- What you find?
- Not even a scratch on the door sir.
The arsenal must've been opened with a key.
Tell the chief steward to bring
MacArdle and Miss Porter to my cabin.
Yes sir.
Listen darling, where did you put that half of the hundred pound note?
- I know it's safe but I got to...
- I hid it.
- Where?
- In Gaskell's cabin, in a tin of cigarettes.
- Well, aren't you a wonder.
- It's safe.
He won't find it, he doesn't smoke my kind.
- Oh, quit worrying, I'll get it.
- No, you won't.
You'll stay right where you are till this thing blows over.
Now, promise me darling, that you won't go near the place.
That's easy. I wouldn't exactly enjoy looking...
Looking at his bandaged feet.
Well, that's too bad.
But what about us?
What about the poor devils he captured?
You know, I wouldn't put it past him to use the Chinese boot on them.
- If he does, they'll talk.
- Oh, he won't use the boot.
- He'd never hit a man below the belt.
- Well, we're not hung yet.
Gaskell may suspect the whole world but he's got to prove it.
- Well, let him prove it, let him prove it.
- Are you out of your mind?
Alright, come in.
Captain Gaskell's compliments and will you come to his cabin?
And you too Miss Portland.
Just a minute.
- Jamesy, that...
- Now, now, now, wait a minute.
It's simply a matter of routine.
If it comes to the worst, I'm the only one that he can prove anything against.
So you just sit tight and keep a stiff upper lip.
Alright bozo.
Order me an upper and lower and I'll keep them both stiff.
Alright, come on, answer.
- After you left my cabin, where you go?
- Back to my own quarters.
- What time was that?
- About half past 11.
- Was anybody there?
- Nobody but Isabel, I told her to go to bed.
Your maid says she was asleep at a quarter after 9, two hours before.
Ah, it's always a quarter after 9 to that numbskull, it's the only time she knows.
- Did anybody come to your cabin later?
- My dates are my own now.
The deck watch saw a man leaving your cabin after 1 o'clock, that was you, wasn't it?
- Look here Alan, that's not...
- I'm conducting this inquiry Sir Guy.
That was you, wasn't it?
What do you want me to do?
Blacken the lady's name?
- That was Jamesy, wasn't it?
- Well, supposing it was, what then?
Why was he in your cabin?
He came to borrow a hot water bottle for one of his pigs.
- Got a cigarette Jamesy?
- No darling.
- Here, here you better have one of your own.
- No, never mind, I don't...
No, no bother at all, I know what these little attentions mean to a woman.
Well I, I don't want one now.
I guess it's just nerves, I...
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry you don't feel well, you rode out the piracy as such a good shape.
- Perhaps you'd like one.
- Well, well, thank you.
The captain is far more generous with your cigarettes than you ever were.
Too generous. I guess I'll take them home with me while there's... still a couple left for myself.
- How many tins have you Jamesy?
- One.
- Four and one are five, are...
- Lose any?
I thought I left six here.
Oh, yes, yes, so you did, I almost forgot.
I don't understand this cat and mouse business.
Is this the one?
Yes, that's it.
You won't find what you're looking for,
I've both halves of the hundred pound note.
Oh, what are you browbeating the girl for?
Just a minute MacArdle, your turn is next.
One half of the note was found on a dead pirate, the other half was hidden... in her cigarette tin.
Hello.
- These Chinese characters look familiar.
- Yes, they're MacArdle's shipping symbol.
Well, that's queer.
If I wasn't sure of it, why, I'd swear that I wrote those characters.
I'll swear you wrote them
MacArdle before any admiralty court.
Yes? Well, what will your oath prove?
Save your breath MacArdle, we caught two of your men, they've talked.
- You used the Chinese boot on them.
- No, I saved that for you, if I needed it.
How did you manage to get the ship's rifles?
You couldn't have done a thing without them.
You've answered to all the questions so far, don't stop now.
Alright, I won't.
- You gave him the key to the arsenal.
- Me?
She gave me nothing.
You were the only one who knew where it was besides myself, you came to my cabin...
- Alright, you lost it.
- Waited till I passed out...
- get to the key and handle over to MacArdle.
- That's a dirty rotten lie,
I'll sue the line and get plenty too.
- Defaming a lady's character...
- Yes, quartermaster.
- Yes sir?
- Tell the sergeant at guard to come here.
And send a radio message to the police superintendent in Singapore.
- Tell him to meet us at the dock, urgent.
- Urgent, yes sir.
And you better send for a squad of lawyers too if... you think you going to pin anything on me.
- What a dirty little snake you are.
- What's that to you?
Getting into my cabin because I trusted you.
- Trust? When do you really trust...
- Waiting for a chance to...
- do your double cross.
- I didn't.
- Turning on your own people.
- I didn't, I...
- Sold out every man woman coming on-board.
- Alright then, I did.
I stole the key, yes,
I stole it and gave it to Jamesy.
But I came to your cabin to warn you about him, figure it out for yourself why I didn't.
I'd have stood and fought back to back with you.
But you taught me something I didn't even know myself.
When a woman can love a man right down to her fingertips, she can hate him the same way.
Now call your cops, call every cop in the country, I don't care.
If you can dish it out, I can take it.
You fool, you hotheaded, crazy little fool.
And me thinking all the time that my powers of fascination had won her.
Ah, don't be so tough Gaskell.
China Doll had nothing to do with it at all.
You think it's as simple as all that?
I'm not the judge, the jury and the law.
You'll find that out soon enough.
No, I won't. I've fooled them many a time before and I've done it again.
I've cost you millions, and I'd still be fooling them... if it wasn't for the little yellow haired lass sad... that wouldn't even give me the time of the day.
- What's wrong MacArdle?
- Nothing, nothing.
Nothing at all.
One of those pills will make a pig sleep the entire voyage.
- I'll sleep until kingdom come.
- Get a doctor quick.
Jamesy.
I had a chance darling, to throw you overboard.
If I had, I'd still be safe.
Loving you is the only decent thing I ever did in my life.
Even that was a mistake.
- You sent for me sir?
- Take Miss Porter to her cabin.
Keep a close watch over her until further orders.
Aye sir.
Well, he's out of it anyway.
- He finished the game the way he played it.
- Yeah, tough.
He didn't yell no dice when they rolled against him, I won't either.
Good luck toots.
- Singapore.
- So am I, where are you from?
Lordy, Lordy. Now I got enough clothes to last me a million years.
Well, I hope you have better luck in them than I did.
Don't you worry
Miss Dolly, I got me a conjure.
The left hind leg of a black cat that's been killed by a snakebite.
Nothing going to touch me no matter what they does to you.
Yes?
Well darling, have you put your house in order?
No, it's in a worse mess than ever.
Sybil, I should've told you before, I'll be tied up here for weeks at the hearing.
Now Alan dear, what are you trying to tell me? Be frank.
That's just it...
I want you to escape all the frankness it's going to be thrown around the next few weeks.
Everybody will know about it, read about it.
Even at home, for that matter, the people you know.
But you can live down a scandal if you want to.
Yes but this will have an official stamp on it.
I'll have to get up in court, tell the whole story.
I want to Sybil, because I'm involved.
In fact, I'm as guilty as she.
Guilty? Oh, what nonsense.
How could you be Alan?
I am though.
She tried to warn me about
MacArdle, I wouldn't listen.
I nearly threw her out.
With as dirty an insult as a man could give a woman.
- That's not like you.
- I don't know why.
Except, I'd just seen her in MacArdle's cabin.
I didn't think she get skid that far.
And you're really in love with... this old tub after all.
No, no but it's that too.
After all you can't pile up 6 years... of something and then just leave in the flash, you know?
No.
No, of course not.
Well, I'm off to the hotel.
I'll take the next boat home.
You know, I came
15,000 miles to find you Alan.
Now you're further away than you ever were.
You wouldn't like that fireplace in Sussex.
I think that's what
I've been trying to tell you.
Sybil, aren't you clinging to something that I could never be again?
Yes, perhaps I am.
But I think that's the only beautiful way it ever could be.
- Goodbye Alan.
- Goodbye Sybil.
Come on, you large, limping seagull.
Come to the office and resign.
Don't worry about that,
I'll resign soon enough.
All I got to do is scratch my name on a piece of paper.
Around this madhouse, it's always a million things to do before you can do what you want.
- I'll make it easy, honest I will Poopsie.
- Good bye.
Hey, you're just the guy, where can I pick up a string of genuine pearls for the missus?
Oh, yes, yes, I'll be very glad to arrange it for you.
That's a pal, I told you
I'd square with you Poopsie.
You squared it beautifully.
Bank sent for the gold sir.
- Alright, turn it over to them.
- But there isn't any gold sir.
- The boxes were full of sand.
- Oh yes, yes, so they were.
The shipment is in the toolbox of the steamroller.
Steamroller? Toolbox?
That stumps me sir, I never would've thought of looking for it there.
No, I was counting on that.
Oh, so you decided to make the trip after all?
Yes. Yes, I just came along looking for local color.
Local color, phooey. If anybody could get local color, I can get it.
These streets are in deplorable condition.
Quartermaster, fish him out before he soaks up all the local color in the harbor.
Aye, aye sir.
Come in.
- Is the police superintendent ready?
- He'll be here any minute now, come on.
Goodbye, Isabel.
Goodbye Miss Dolly, you sure been mighty good to me,
- Skip it.
- Even if they does hang you.
Well, there's the old Quien-Howe.
Aren't they ever going to paint that smokestack?
Boy, how you used to crab about it when you were first mate on her.
Seems like a thousand years ago.
Well, you don't need to talk if you don't want to.
I was only doing it for the benefit of those mugs back there.
That's what I thought.
I've never seen the time yet when you could overlook an audience.
That's more like it, it's kind of good to have you barking at me again.
Always worrying about your performance, you don't care... about anything except, how is the act going?
What you crying for?
I can't help it.
Get in there and quit that blubbering.
- Now, listen to me numbskull.
- I'm all ears.
My official job ends when I turn you over to the police superintendent.
From then on,
I'll be on your side of the fence.
Oh, what's the use? I'll plead guilty and take what's coming.
- You're going to tell the whole truth.
- Sure I am, that's the least I can do.
And I'm going to tell the truth, everything.
That you tried to warn me, that, well, that I was drunk.
- Oh, no, you weren't.
- Yes, I was. Dead drunk.
Oh, you big cluck, you'll gum up the works, you'll ruin yourself.
You'll bust up your whole career if you do that.
It's nothing else to do
Dolly, it's your only chance.
Oh, never mind me, what about her?
She going back to England.
- Back to England? But you still love her.
- She's leaving on the next boat.
Oh, you can't let her do that toots, you still in love her.
- Don't start telling me what to do.
- I said, you're still in love with her.
- And don't yell like that, I'm not deaf.
- Oh, you poor sap, you love her.
And don't call me a sap.
- You love her.
- Yes, I love her.
But not the way I do you.
Oh toots, you can't.
That ain't fair, ain't right. A nogood dame like... me why, I'll always have you in trouble Alan.
No, you won't.
Married life will slow you down plenty.
You...
You'd marry me?
Well no, not if you're going to make it such a blasted favor.
Oh, you, you poor sap.
Come in.
- Good morning captain.
- Good morning superintendent.
- Here's your receipt for the prisoners.
- Yes, all right.
I'll be over as soon as I get through.
- Anything you want...
- Anything I...
Toots, I got everything.
Come on superintendent, let's get on the horse.
What about a nip to cool that aching brow?
No, no, fix one for yourself,
I got to get around to court.
Somebody will have to protect that judge.
Those shoes are disgraceful on an officer Mr. Kingston.
- A hose coupling just broke sir.
- Hose couplings shouldn't break.
Change the hose and change your shoes Mr. Kingston.
Yes sir.
Change your shoes Mr. Kingston.
A piracy, a typhoon, a disabled ship swung into port, his sweetheart on her way to... jail and all he can say by way of conversation...
- is change your shoes Mr. Kingston.
- That bark of his is all front.
- He's really pretty sick at heart.
- Sick? The man hasn't got a heart.
Perhaps not Mr. Kingston but whatever it is he has, it gets things done.
