Uncle Mickey was shipwrecked.
'Twas a dark and stormy night.
The lightning flashed.
The thunder rolled.
The wind whistled.
And the wind howled.
It was a terrible storm.
And then a big wave picked me up and rolled me up on the beach.
I was in a strange land.
Boy, was I tired.
I slept all night, under a blanket of beautiful stars.
And then day broke.
Fire!

Once upon a time
A story was told
About fairies and goblins
And witches who are bold
They haunted the forests
and meadows and dells
And this is the legend
The storybook tells
Oh, don't you remember
A long time ago
When two little babes
Whose names I don't know
They wandered away
on a bright summer day
And were left in the woods
I've heard people say
Aah!
Aah! Aah!
Ha ha ha, ho ho ho
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha, ho ho ho
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
Heh heh heh heh heh heh heh!

Uhh!
Fee, fi, bone.
I'll change you into stone.
Quiet, brat...
I'll change you into a rat.
Aah!
Uhh!
Uhh!
And so ends our story
As all stories shouId
They lived
happily ever after
Those babes in the wood

Boys, keep quiet.
My father owned a small estate in Nottinghamshire.
I was third of his sons.
In my youth i occupied myself with medicine, after that i sailed for some years as a ship suregon.
Once i sailed on 'Antelope' to South Ocean.
It was stormy weather, big waves washed over deck and deafening wind blew in the sails.
Then I noticed a ship with black sails.
Those were the pirates.
Their fast brig ramed into 'Antelope', the impact was so heavy that i went overdoard and fell on the deck of pirates' ship.
Horrible crash was heard and poor 'Antelope' went down with all its crew.
"By thousand devils!" pirates shouted "All sorts of old boats are slouching around!"
Meanwile the storm...
Boatswain!
Everybody in their places!
Get out, lazybones! To work!
Oh, you, mariners!
Who are you?

Hey, old jackal, don't dare to touch [that] kid!
I will teach you...
Sit down! ???
Doctor Gulliver, i'm Vanya. Let's shake hands!
Hands up, bandits! Or you will have a bomb for breakfast.
Thrown down [your] weapons!

Well, l brought you down safe and sound.
 Once upon a time
in sunny Spain
there was a little bull,
and his name was Ferdinand.
All the other little bulls
he lived with
would run and jump
and butt their heads together.
But not Ferdinand.
He had his favorite spot
out in the pasture,
under a cork tree.
And he would sit just quietly
in its shade all day
and smell the flowers.
Sometimes his mother, who was a cow,
Would worry about him.
She was afraid he would
be lonesome all by himself.
Now, Ferdinand, why don't you play with all the other little bulls and butt your head?
 But Ferdinand
would shake his head.
I like it better here, where I can sit just quietly and smell the flowers.
 And because she was
an understanding mother,
even though she was a cow,
she let him just sit there
and be happy.
As the years went by,
Ferdinand grew
and grew and grew,
until he was very big and very strong.
All the other bulls
wanted most of all
to fight at the bullfights in Madrid.
But not Ferdinand.
He still liked to sit just
quietly under the cork tree
and smell the flowers.
One day five men
came in funny hats
to pick the biggest,
fastest, roughest bull
to fight in the bullfights.
All the other bulls ran around leaping
and huffing and butting their heads,
so the men would think
they were strong and fierce
and pick them.
But not Ferdinand.
He knew they wouldn't pick him
and he didn't care.
So he went out under his
favorite cork tree to sit down,
but he didn't look
where he was sitting,
and he sat on a bumblebee!
 Ferdinand ran around puffing
and snorting as if he were crazy.
The five men saw him,
and they all shouted with joy.
"Look at him go!"
- ¡Bravo!
- ¡Excelente!
- ¡Magnífico!
- ¡Espléndido!
This is the one!
Whoopee!
 So they took him away
for the bullfight day in a cart.
What a day it was!
Flags were flying,
bands were playing.
They had a parade
into the bullring.
 First came
the banderilleros.
Next came the picadors.
Then came the matador,
the proudest of all.
Then came the bull.
And you know who that was,
don't you?
Mm-hmm.
Ferdinand.
Hooray!
 They called him
Ferdinand the Fierce,
and all the banderilleros
were afraid of him.
The picadors were afraid of him,
and the matador,
he was scared stiff.
When Ferdinand saw the lovely flowers,
he ran to the middle of the ring.
Everyone shouted, because they
thought he was going to fight fiercely.
When he got to the middle of the ring,
he sat down just quietly...
... and smelled.
The banderilleros were mad,
and the picadors were madder.
But the matador
was the maddest of all.
Come on, fight!
What's the matter?
Be fierce!
Come on, come on!
Boo! Ahhh! Bah!
 The matador,
he made very ugly faces.
Wahhh!
Na na na na na na na!
Nyah!
 But Ferdinand
just sat and smelled.
The matador, he was furious.
He broke his sword
in little pieces.
He stomped his feet.
He pulled his hair.
But still Ferdinand
sat just quietly...
... and smelled.
He pleaded with Ferdinand.
Please, please!
Stick me, do something.
Do something!
Give it to me!
Whoa. Whoa.
 The matador
was so mad he cried,
'cause he couldn't show off
with his cape and sword.

So they had
to take Ferdinand home.
And for all I know,
he is sitting there still
under his favorite cork tree,
Smelling the flowers...
... just quietly.
He is very happy.
Nuts.
Hello. Hello, hello, hello. Who?
What's that? Hello?
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, he's here.
Hey, you. Telephone.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Well, what do you want?
- Speak up.
- Skip it.
- Skip it?

Cards, cut.
Hey.
- Call out the cards!
- Call out the cards!
- Call out the cards!
- Call out the cards!
Call out the cards!
Calling all cards. Calling all cards.
Calling all cards. Calling all cards.

Good Thing We're Leaving.
Betty.
Christina,Are You Real?

I Came To Help You Pack Up Your Things.
I Thought This Might
Be A Bit Hard For You.
Christina,Have I Changed...
Since I First Started At "Mode"?

I Don't Know. It's This Place.
It Does Something To You.
Can You Believe This Is Even Happening?
Bradford Seemed Fine.
No,And He's Still Handsome
In,Like,A Sean Connery Kind Of Way.
Why Is It Always Sadder When
Tragedy Strikes Hot People?
No,I Want You To Get
The Hell Out Of Here!
Daniel, Let's Not Make A Scene.
Intensive Care Is For Family Members,
And Since You Never Married My Father,
You're Not Part Of The Family. Stay Out.
I'm Sorry You All Had To See That.
I Caught Him Poking
Around The Morphine Drawer.
I Swear,Underneath It
All, He's Still A Good Boy.
Marc,Get The Car. On It.
All Right,People, Get Out Of The Way.
I Got A Very Important Person Here.

My Name Is Marc St. James,
And I'm Playing A Part In This Drama.

Well,He's In A Robin's
Egg Blue Hospital Gown
With White Piping.
They Say He's Still Unconscious.
What Is That? Uh,My

I'm So Sorry.
I Know How Much This Job Meant To You.
It's Okay,Dad. I'm Okay.
Give Me Daniel's Number.
I'll Tell Him The Only
Reason You Lied To Him
About Wilhelmina's Affair Was
To Get Me Home From Mexico.
Dad,No. Look,It's
- It's Probably All For The Best.
Good For You,Honey.
Next,You Join A Gym And Get Smoking Hot.
Then When You Run Into Daniel,
He'll Be Begging You To Come Back.
That's The Way I Always Play It.
Mija, You Okay?
I've Just-
I've Been Thinking About This Last Year,

Mrs. Meade,You're
Alive And In My Bedroom.
Actually, In Our Last Hideout,
We Had Separate Rooms And A Fireplace.
Um,Okay,Uh,I Don't
Even Know Who You Are,
But You Can't Be Here.
Betty,I'm Leaving The Country Tonight,
But I Need A Favor.
Um,No. No,I-I Can't Help
You Get Out Of The Country.
You're A Felon. You Could
Get Us All In Trouble,
And My Father Just Became A Citizen.
Here,I Can Give You A Hat. What
About This Sweater? I Like This.
It's Not For Me. It's For My Children.
I Told You, They Gon' Be Fine.
They White.
I Need To Find Out If
Bradford's Changed The Will.
If Wilhelmina Got To Him,
He May Have Left Her The Company.
And I Can't Disappear Without Knowing
My Children Are Taken Care Of.
How Am I Supposed To Know
Anything About Bradford's Will?
I Will Tell You Where
It Is And How To Get It.
It's Right In His Office.
No. I Don't Know. Mrs.
Meade,I Don't Know.
I Mean This Is Exactly The Type Of Thing
I Need To Stop Doing.
Why Would You Stop Helping
People You Care About?
I Thought You And Daniel Were Friends.
You're My Only Hope.
Fine.
Fine,I Will Do It, But For Daniel.
I Owe Him This.
I Just Spoke To Amanda.
No Change. Bradford's Still Unconscious.
It Was A Beautiful Wedding, Willie,
Right Up Until The Heart Attack.
Yes,And Thanks To His
Inconvenient Collapse,
Now My Future Is In Limbo.
Oh,I Know You Don't Like The Limbo
Or The Electric Slide Or
Any Forced Party Dancing.
I Was Supposed To Walk
Into That Building On Monday
As Mrs. Bradford Meade,
Owning Half The Company.
Without That Ring On My Finger,
I Don't Know Where I Stand.
I Know He Changed The Will.
I Just Don't Know What It Says.
For All I Know,
He Could Be Leaving
Everything To... Charity.
Marc,I Think You Know
What We Need To Do.
Find This Chity Person And Kill Her.
We Need To Get Our Hands On The Will.
Yeah.
Hey,L'amanda.
I Just Forgot One Thing. I
Need To Scoot Back To My Desk.
Sorry. Aah,Excuse Me?
You Are No Longer
Permitd In These Offices.
Now I Have Received Word You

You Received Word From
Me. I Told You That.
If I Hadn't, You Wouldn't
Know. Suarez,I Have A Gun,
And I Will Not Hesitate To Use It.
They Give You A Gun? No,Girl,
They Didn't Give Me No Gun,
But I Swear To You, I Will
Jump Out This Circle Desk
And Tackle You. It'll Just Be A Second.
Okay,Here I Come, 'Cause See,You
- Okay,Okay,Okay.
I'm Going. Get On Outta Here.
That's Right,And Trust Me,

Hey,Are You Okay?
Oh,Yeah,My Father's Upstairs
Fighting For His Life.
I'm Taking It Out On
This Vending Machine.
He's Gonna Be Okay,Daniel.
You Told Everyone That Yourself.
Come On,Amanda.
What Was I Supposed To Say,Hmm?
Dr. Dredski To Pathology.
It's Just...
You Always Think You're Gonna
Have More Time With Someone.
I Never Told Him I Loved Him.
Do You Love Him?
Yes.
Yes.
We Were Just Never
One Of Those Families.
We Never Said It.
Look,Daniel,
You May Never Have Gotten
His Love Or Approval,
But At Least You Got His Jawline.
Daniel,He's Not Gone.
He's Right Upstairs,
And You Can Still Go Tell
Him Anything You Want To.
Hey,L'amanda.
Hey,Cutie-Pie.
You Just Missed Your
Girlfriend,Betty Suarez.
Ugh. Girlfriend. Please.
I Don't Know How Many Times
I Have To Tell That Girl,
That Is Not The Way I Roll.
Oh,Really? Oh,No.
I'm Sweet Like Sugar, Soft Like Suede,
But Unlike A Piano, I Never Get Played.
Ooh,Honey,Listen,
I Will Play You Like Stevie Wonder
On A Baby Grand.
Sugarstick, Where You Been All My Life?
Math Camp.
Mm,Well,1 Plus 1...
Is 2.
I Knew That.
I Knew You Knew That.
I'm Glad You Knew That
I Knew That You Knew
That I Knew That.
Betty?
Who The Hell Are You?
Uh,Cable Company.
I Didn't Let Anyone In
From A Cable Company.
The Cable Company.
Seriously? Mrs. Meade?
How Many Homes Did You Break Into
Before You Got Caught?
The Cable Company.
You Tell Me That I'm Stupid... Why You Got To
Be Bustin' Me Out Like That In Front Of People?
Fish,Don't Do This, And Fish Don't Do
That. I Told You This Was Not A Good-
You Know Exactly What You're Doing...
Everybody Believes Somebody Came...
And You've Known It From The Very Beginning.
From The Cable Company. I Told You.
Mr. Suarez, So Nice
To See You Again. Hi.
I'm Just Saying,
You Looked A Little Too Into
The Whole Sugarstick Thing.
Hey,I Let You Slip Past L'amanda
So You Can Get The Key
To The Executive Floor.
It's Kind Of Nice Having The Sweetness
Recognized. I Call You Sweet All The Time.
I Know. I'm Just Playin'
Ya. Don't Do That.
Sorry. Okay,I'm Gonna Go
In And Look For The Safe.
You Be Lookout. Oh,No,I
Wanna Look For The Safe.
No,You're Lookout. Okay,You're
Acting Sort Of Bossy.
Oh. Oh,God,I-I Am.
I Used To Just Be A Liar And A Thief,
And Now I'm Bossy,Too.
Sweetie,If It Makes You Feel Any Better,
You've Always Been A Little
Bossy. Oh,Thank You, Sugarstick.
If I Ate Lunch,
Now Would Be The Time To Lose It.
What Are You Two Doing Here?
I Imagine E Same Thing
You're Doing Here.
You're Looking For A Memento
To Remember Your Dying Husband?
Oh,Um, Technically Fianc?
That's One.
Yes,Uh,We Are Here
Looking For A Memento,Too.
Yeah,Mr. Meade Meant A Lot To Me,
Being My Girlfriend's Boss' Father.
Well,Don't Let Us Stop You.
Or Us You.
Nope.
No Memento There.
Nothing In Here,Either.
Ooh,Ooh.
What Is It? Everyone's
Salaries. Nice,Willie.
Oh,Let's End This.
I Can't Stand Another
Minute In This Room
With Tweedledee And Tweedle Diego.
Obviously,You Want To
Find The Will For Daniel.
I Don't Know What You're Talking About.
Oh,Betty. We Both Want The Same Thing.
Why Don't We Agree To Find The Will,
Read It,Shake Hands,
Wash Our Hands And Go On With Our Lives?
Please, Do You Really Think
I Enjoy Scheming,Lying,
And Scurrying About

Cheekbones? Yes,I Think You Do.

But Seriously, I Am Tired Of The Drama.
So Much Drama.
The Will Is In The Wall Safe.
I Have The Combination.
I low Ouyou'ren Trble,Mrs. Meade,
But I Don't Like It.
My Betty's Doing Things She Shouldn't Be
Doing. I Did Not Force Her To Do Anything.
She Said She Wanted Do It For Daniel.
Daniel? After The Way He Treated Her?
Why? What-What Happened?
I'll Tell You What Happened.
Papi.
It's My Other Daughter. Hide.
She Won't Like This.
Are You There?
What Are You Doing Lying On Betty's Bed?
Oh,Nothing.
Putting Away Some Clothes And Got Tired.
Who's She?
Exterminator.
Unbelievable.
Mrs. Meade?
You Are The Worst Fugitive In The World.
Okay,Just So We're
Clear, We Read The Will,
And No Matter Who Wins, We
Respect Mr. Meade's Wishes.
Agreed.
I Just Want To Be Done Here
And Go Back To Mourning My Late Husband.

And,Once Again, You're
Not Technically Married.
That's Two.

What Are You Looking At?
That Grate.

This Could Be Our Way Out.

Of Our Marriage. "
And There Goes That Feeling.
It's Over. We're Sunk.
Upon Pronouncement Of Our Marriage.
Oh, I'm Gonna Have To Go Back
To Dancing In A Cage In My Underwear.

Perhaps There's Another Option.
Oh,Thank God, Because
To Be Honest With You,
I Only Had This One Move. Ow.
There Still Might Be Another Way
To Legally Become Mrs. Bradford Meade.
Is There Water Boiling Underneath You?
'Cause I Think I Smell A Plan Brewing.
We're In A Vent.
Can You Believe This?
We Are Actually Crawling Through A Vent.
My Mother Never Even Let

Mr. Meade, What Happened?

Mrs. Meade,It'setty.
Um,I'm Here With Your Husband.
He Wants To Talk To You.

And I Don't Want Him
To See Me Like This.

Claire.
You Can't Be Here.
I Don't Care.
I'm So Sorry.
I
Didn't-I-
Shh.
Shh. Don't Talk.
Let's Just Sit Here.
You Know, On Our Wedding Day,
When I Was Waiting To
Walk Down The Aisle To You,
I Remember Thinking,
Someday That Son Of A Bitch
Is Going To Break My Heart.
And I Did.
But I'd Take That Walk Again Tomorrow
If You Could Promise
Me Another 35 Years.
I've Never Loved Anyone More Than You.
Thank You For Giving
Me The Greatest Life.
I'll Give You Guys A Minute.
Look,I Know Why You Couldn't Tell Me
About Wilhelmina's Affair.
Daniel, All I Care About
Is That You Know I'm On Your Side...
Always.
I Know.
I
- I Just...
Felt Betrayed.
Betty,I Would Love For
You To Come Back To Work.
That Means So Much.
But I Don't Think I Can.
What?
Daniel,This
- This Last Year At "Mode,"
I
- I Wouldn't Trade That For Anything.
I Mean,You Took A Chance On Me,
And It Opened Up A
Whole Different World.
It Totally Changed My Life,
But,I Think,Too Much.
I'm Changing Into Someone That I
- I Really Don't Want To Be.
So You're Leaving?
I Think I Have To.
It's Your Life,Betty.
You Do What You Have To Do.
Oh! Please Let Me Go See Him One More-
She's Not Resisting.
Don't Hurt Her. Come On.
I'm Not Fighting You. Daniel,Alexis!
Betty,Can You Please Stay With
My Dad? Don't Hurt My Mother.
Claire?
No,Uh,She Left. It's Betty.
Betty,Come Here.
Do You Need A Nurse?
Are You All Right?
I Need You To Do Something For Me.
What?
Take Care Of Daniel.
I Won't Be Here,And-
No,Mr. Meade. You're Gonna Be Fine.
I Remember Seeing You
Walk Into The Building That First Day.
I Had A Feeling About You.
You're The Only One Who's Ever Been Able
To Keep Daniel On His Path.
He'd Be Lost Without You.
Now I Need Some Water.
Um...
Mr. Meade.
Mr. Meade? Excuse Me,Miss.
We Need To Get Through.
Watch Your Back. Excuse Us.
There's No Pul.
Get Prepped And Ready. Bagging.
Charging.

Is This Bradford Mea's Body?
You Look Like A Young Doctor
Fresh Out Of Medical School.
You Must Have Some Loans.
I Have A Proposition You
Might Be Interested In.
Well--heh heh heh--may the best man--heh--win.
Thanks, I will.
But I won't beat ya too bad.
Shake!
Ha ha, ha ha, ha ha!
Heh heh heh heh.
That's a funny joke.
But--heh heh--you caught me fair and square.
No hard feelings?
Uh-uh.
Put her there!
Ha ha, ha ha, ha ha!
On your marks... get set...
Shh!
Ha ha, ha ha, ha ha!
Yoo-hoo!
Ain't he big and handsome?
He surely is a whiz.
You don't talk tootin', cutie.
I'm the very best there is.
Yoo-hoo!
Wanna stop and play?
Come on!
We're havin' lots of fun.
Oh, man.
I ain't got time.
I got a race to run.
Uhh!
Ha ha, ha ha, ha ha!
Don't you think you'd better go?
The tortoise has the lead.
Say, I've lots of time for play.
My middle name is Speed.
He sure can run like sixty.
Oh, baby, ain't he slick?
I was just warmin' up.
Here's a bigger trick.
I build my house of straw
I build my house of hay
I toot my flute,
I don't give a hoot
And play around all day
I build my house of sticks
I build my house of twigs
With a hey, diddle, diddle
I play on the fiddle
And dance all kinds of jigs
I build my house of stone
I build my house of bricks
I've had no chance to sing and dance
'Cause work and play don't mix
He don't take no time to play
Time to play, time to play
All he does is work all day
You can play and laugh and fiddle
Don't think you can make me sore
I'll be safe, and you'll be sorry

I, Lemuel Gulliver
give thee a faithful history
of my most interesting adventure
in the South Sea.
On the 5th day of November, 1699,
having reached latitude 30 degrees,
two minutes south,
a storm of great fury suddenly...
All's well!
All's well!
# All's well! What's a rainy day? #
# Never mind that cloud. #
# Behind that cloud you'll find a golden ray. #
# All's well! Laugh your fears away. #
# See the light ahead. Right ahead. #
# There's a moonlit night ahead. #
# Everyone, come on have fun. All's well! #
Why do they make me sing that song?
The poet who wrote it was certainly wrong.
It's bright ahead. The light's ahead.
I'd rather go home and go right to bed.
All's well!
My feet are wet and my bunions ache, and yet I've to keep wide awake, all night!
I wake folks up to tell them things are all right!
And, # All's well! What's a rainy day? #
# Never mind that cloud. #
# Behind that cloud you'll find a golden ray. #
# All's well! Laugh your fears away. #
# See the light ahead. Right ahead. #
# There's a moonlit night ahead. #
# Everyone, come on have fun. All...
A, A, All's well! Wha, wha, what's a rainy day?
The king has visitors.
Do you know they're signing a wedding contract?
There's a giant on the beach!
There, there's a giant out there!
Your majesty.
Thank you, your majesty.
Marriage Contract
King Little of Lilliput
Does this 5th day of November 1699 give the hand of his daughter
Princess Glory to Prince David son of Bombo
King of Blefuscu!
Quite in order, fine.
King Bombo!
Well we did it, you little rascal, you.
We did it.
Yes we, we certainly did, didn't we?
Just a couple of old dag cupids, I think! [laughs}
Your majesty, the wedding things are here.
There's a giant on the beach!
Let me go!
Let me go! Let me go!
There's a giant on the beach! Let me go!
Exquisite taste, exquisite!
Roses, Freesia, Rhododendrons,
Ranunculus, Snap Dragons, and Daisies.
Ahh!
They're pretty Posies, aren't they?
Beautiful blooms, beautiful!
Oh!
May I?
Oh, please do!
Magnificent!
Oh! A masterpiece!
Vanilla. Wow!
# Faithful. Remember, that whatever I do,
I'm always faithful, my love. #
# Faithful, with all my soul and thankful for you, #
# who came from heaven above. #
# We'll dance tonight together, on a world with me we'll find. #
My only little daughter. I dread losing her.
Huh, Buck up there old boy, you're not losing a daughter. You’re gaining a son.
My son!
# So I'll be faithful and faithful as I promise to be, and you'll be for all mine. #
Hmm. Lovely melody.
Yes, we like it.
That is Faithful. The song of Lilliput.
It will be played at the wedding tomorrow.
Of course. Of course.
What's that, Faithful? Oh, no, no! Forever!
The song of Blefuscu must be played at the wedding.
But Bombo, Faithful is always played at our weddings.
It, it's tradition, sir. And it's very pretty.
Yes, yes, I know. Pleasant little ditty, oh but hardly appropriate for this great occasion.
But Forever! There's a song for you! Ha, ha!
Faithful will be played.
Bah! Fodder. Absolute fodder. It must be Forever!
Faithful.
Forever!
Faithful.
Forever!
Faithful.
It will be Forever, or there will be no wedding!
No wedding? But the cake and the pretty flowers and.. oh Bombo, you'll love Faithful.
Ahh!
It's war!
There's a giant on the beach!
It's war!
War. Woe is me. Woe is me.
I found a mountain, your majesty. I found it!
It was man, a man mountain!
War isn't nice.
It was, was this big!
No, no. It was this big!
People get hurt in wars.
He's as big, as big as, as,.. big as, as, as..
Wait your majesty!
Bombo can't frighten me. No sir.
Don't stand there like a nincompoop!
I'm trying to tell you that there's a giant!
When I get my dandruff up, then look out.
But Glory, poor little Glory.
Don't look now gentleman, but it's war.
War? Whoopee!
# Forever, forever, #
# There won't be anyone but you. #
# Remember I'm true, my sweet. #
# Forever, forever, #
# You'll share in everything I do, #
# And keep smiling through, my sweet. #
# I'll have just you here in my heart, #
# And I'll trust you though we're apart. #
# So, forever, forever, #
# My guiding angel you will be. #
# So always have faith in me. #

Stop! Stop you swine!
Get back to your posts!
Get back there and fight!
We of Blefuscu are not!
... afraid of anything.
Well, where's everyone gone?
This is no way to treat a harmless visitor.
Look Gabby, we've won! Gabby! Gabby?
See Gabby? They've gone.
Yes, sir. Scared stiff.
Hello there.
Come now, don't let my size frighten you.
You, your majesty, surely you're not afraid of me?
Nuh uh.
Well, good. Then let me present myself.
My name is Gulliver, your majesty.
Lemuel Gulliver, a shipwrecked sailor.
At your service.
Well, welcome to Lilliput,
Mr., Mr. Gulliver.
Uh Mr. Gulliver, can you fight?
Well your majesty,
I can lick anybody my size.
Ah, splendid, splendid!
I don't think Bombo will give us any further trouble while you're around here.
No sir!
He's on our side, Gabby.
He's on our side!
There's nothing to fear!
The man mountain's on our side!

Out of soap! Push him up!
Out of soap! Push him up!
Outta the tub! He's a coming up!
Hey look out! Grab it! Pull it off! Nab it!
Pull it off! Take it off!
You understand that not until that giant is removed can our forces taste the sweet fruits of victory!
Now then, it is up to you to carry this message to my spies in Lilliput.
Be off and may luck be with you!
Too-de-loo!
Get going!
Your majesty, I'm sorry the little princess isn't with us.
Yes, too bad. Too much excitement for one day.
Dear spies: Get rid of that Giant or else... Cordially yours King Bombo

# Come home again you sailor man, sailor man #

Ahoy, mate! Ahoy, m...
Ahoy, mate! Ahoy! Ahoy!
I see that you're a sailor boy.
I owned a boat. A beauty, too.
Fifty times as big as your a, as big as your a, as big as your shoe.
My, my.
Hoy, hoy.
Lost her though in a glorious gale, but I came home on the back of a whale.
But tell me though how you caught the whale.
Simply grabbed a hold of his tail.
My, my.
I, I,
I climbed a mountain peak so high.
I bumped my head against the sky.
And there I was, where was I?
On the Island of Alibi.
Hoy, hoy.
My, my.
Hi, hi.
But now my life is very dull.
They ought to make me an admiral.
Now that's the job that I'd enjoy.
I must be going. Ahoy! Ahoy!
My, my, my.
You put that ball in there.
And then it goes down and around.
Pull that thing.
And it comes out here.
The g-g-g-g-giant!
Wow!
The light. The light.
Douse the light!
He's gone.
Phew!
Hello! Anybody in there?
Nobody here but just us spi...
Chickens!
My, my.
# Forever, forever, #
# There won't be anyone but you. #
# Remember I'm true, my sweet. #
# Forever, forever, #
# La, la, la, la, la, la. #
# Forever, forever, #
Forever! Forever!
That's the song of Blefuscu!
A spy!
Charge!
A spy!
A spy!
Charge!
A spy! A spy!
Charge!
Where is he? Where did he go?
Concealing a spy.
And at a time of war, too.
That makes it worse!
Carry on the search men!
Mind you, your father will hear of this.
King Bombo,
Say the word and the giant is a dead duck.
..is a dead duck.
P.S. What do we do with the body?
Two hearts and a wedding broken by a melody?
Incredible!
Wait a minute.
I have an idea that might turn this malice to a melody!
Sing Faithful and Forever together, as one song.
The giant will be a dead duck.
Ha! Now we are getting at somewhere!
Dear Spies, Destroy. Crush.
Obliterate! Annihilate!
Kill him!
I will attack at dawn!
Affectionately yours, Bombo.
Whatcha got there?
Attack at dawn. Attack..
Bombo's attack.., Bom..., Bom...
Guards! Guards! Guards!
Bombo's attacking! Bombo's attacking!
Bombo's attacking at dawn!
Bombo's attacking! It's war!
Bombo's attacking! It's war! It's war!
It's the end of the ending!
To the beach! To the beach!
Bomb.. attacking!
What?
Bombo attacking!
It's war! It's war!
To the beach! To the beach!
The enemy attacks!
To defend Lilliput.
To defend Lilliput!
Yes, forward march.
Gulliver! Gulliver! Where are you?
Bombo's attacking.
Where are you Gulliver?
We'll be wiped out!
Gulliver where are you?
Gulliver! Gulliver! Bombo's attacking!
Gulliver! Gulliver! Bombo's attacking!
It's war! Gulliver! It's war!
Gulliver! Where are you?
Gulliver! Gulliver! It's war!
Gulliver! Bombo's attacking!
Bombo's attacking! It's war!
Put me down.
Hah! Well, where you been you lazy, long legged, overgrown lummox?
Now, get down there to that beach and wipe out that Bombo and that bunch of Blefuscuians.
And tear em to pieces and don't leave a man alive to tell the tale.
Forward march! Get going!
Aye, aye, sir!
My, oh my.
Hey! Wait for me.
Gulliver, wait for me!
Wait for me, Gulliver!
No note.
Where is it?
What did you done with it?
Where did you lose it?
Who's got it now?
Gulliver! Gulliver! Wait for me!
Gulliver! Gulliver!
Let me go! Let me go!
Let's go!
Hold on there!
We can settle this peacefully.
Listen!
Hold you fire!
Hear what I have to say.
Bombo, order your men to lay down their arms.
Must I make you listen?
David, look! Gulliver's thunder machine.
Wait here, Glory.
David!
Fire!
Fire!
Pull! Come on! Pull! Pull!
David!
Poor, poor, foolish little people.
Look what you've done.
Now go ahead! Break your nutshell heads over your songs!
But did you have to break Glory's heart,
King Little, because you are thoughtless and selfish?
And you Bombo, o mighty warrior, what have you won?
You were too stubborn to think, too busy quarrelling to lend ear to the harmony that might have been yours.
But now in your sorrow and despair, perhaps you will listen to your songs as they might be sung.
# Faithful forever whatever I do #
# Remember I'm true, #
# remember that #
# Faithful forever and thankful for you #
# I'll keep smiling through, #
# remember that #
# We may be apart now and then #
# But I'll hold you in my heart #
# Till you're in my arms again #
# Faithful forever I promise to be #
# So always have faith in me #
In behalf of the peoples of
Blefuscu and Lilliput,
With eternal gratitude and love in our hearts, we christen thee, Gulliver!
# Come back again, come back #
# Wherever you may be #
# Come back again you sailor man, sailor man #
# Back again from the sea #
# Come back again you sailor man, sailor man #
# Back again from the sea #

In days of old when knights were bold
And nightshirts held their sway
A jolly minstrel strummed his uke
And sang this merry lay
I am a wandering minstrel
 I journey from afar
 My worldly goods are a sleepy old mule 
 A song and a busted guitar
Ha-ha!
Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!
 A toast we'll sing unto our king 
 To his good health we'll sing 
 A toast we'll sing unto our king 
 Long live the king 
 O hear ye, loyal subjects 
 Of my kingdom of Kalapazoo 
 Of our kingdom of Kalapazoo 
 Upon this day my daughter weds 
 The prince of Poopoopadoo 
 The prince of Poopoopadoo 
Behold the prince!
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-huh!
Behold the princess!
 At my command you'll give thy hand 
In wedlock to yon prince
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-huh!
I know you'll learn to love me.
Never! Never!
Never!
She acts like a fanatic!
Lock her in the attic!
 Cheer up, o lovely princess 
 For you'll be rescued soon 
I'll take thee away so ye won't have to stay
 And marry that silly baboon 
Ha-ha!
Hello!
Shh!
- I'll save thee, Princess.
- How?
- Hath thou a rope?
- Nay, nay. No rope.
What? No rope?
Bring on the wedding feast!
What ho!
Guards! Guards!
Guards!
Wretch! Scoundrel!
Off with his cowardly head!
One, two--
Stop!
I love him, Father!
Spare his head!
Execute the prince instead!
Clear the hall!
We'll have a duel!
The prince shall battle this young fool!
Hooray!
Hooray!
 We're gonna have a duel
We're gonna have a duel 
 We're gonna have a duel
We're gonna have a duel 
 We're gonna have a duel
We're gonna have a duel
 We're gonna have a duel
We're gonna have a duel
 We're gonna have a duel
We're gonna have a duel
 We're gonna have a duel
We're gonna have a duel
- They're off.Hooray!
In days of old when knights were bold
And romance had its fling
All hail the royal bride and groom
Long live the king
Good morning,
Little Red Riding Hood.
Good morning.
How do you do?
Good morning,
Miss Riding Hood.
Where are you going,
Red Riding Hood?
What's in the basket?
Something good?
I'm bringing Grandma cakes and wine.
She's awful, awful sick.
I'm in a great big hurry, too.
I gotta get there quick.
You'll get there quick, red Riding Hood... if you take the shortcut through the wood.
There's danger in them woods.
Beware!
The Big Bad Wolf is lurking there.
Better to be safe than sorry.
Shortcuts are not always good.
Take the long road
'round the forest... while the wolf is in the wood.
That old wolf is just a sissy.
All he does is huff... and puff.
We'll go with you and protect you.
Come along, we'll call his bluff.
Who's afraid of the Big Bad Wolf
Big Bad Wolf,
Big Bad Wolf?
Who's afraid of the Big Bad Wolf
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Heh heh heh heh heh.
I'll get 'em.
I'm Goldilocks, the fairy queen
Spirit of the woods am I
Whoops!
You'll flit and fly from tree to tree
Come, come, my dears, you're safe with me
Whoops!
Ooh!
Aah!
Ehh heh heh heh heh!
Unh! Unh! Unh!
Curses!

Down the stream and through the canyon, down the rushing Tahquamenon, sailing through its bends and windings, sailing through its deeps and shadows, came the littIe Hiawatha -- came in his canoe of birch bark, came in his canoe, the Cheemaun, to the falls of Minnehaha
And the birds sang 'round him, o'er him sang the bluebird, sang the robin,
"Do not shoot us, Hiawatha"
Down the rapids in the river, down the stream went Hiawatha
Though a whirlpool in the water whirled the birch canoe in circles
'round and 'round in gurgling eddies, still the little Hiawatha bravely paddlIed on undaunted for he'd come to hunt the red deer, hunt the rabbit, the Wabasso, hunt the squirreI, the Adjiduamo, hunt the great bear,
Mishe-Mokwa
Fearless was this mighty warrior, skilled in all the craft of hunters
Sure of foot was Hiawatha
So it was that Hiawatha came to end his day of hunting
And the beaver called him brother, helped him as he journeyed homeward, while the rabbit and the red squirrel and the littIe deer that watched him watched him as a friend departing
Mighty hunter Hiawatha, mighty warrior Hiawatha, mighty chieftain Hiawatha,
mighty little Hiawatha
Slave in the Magic Mirror, come from the farthest space.
Through wind and darkness,
I summon thee.
Speak!
Let me see thy face.
What wouldst thou know, my Queen?
Magic Mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all?
Famed is thy beauty, Majesty.
But hold, a lovely maid I see.
Rags cannot hide her gentle grace.
Alas, she is more fair than thee.
Alas for her! Reveal her name.
Lips red as the rose.
Hair black as ebony.
Skin white as snow.
Snow White!
Want to know a secret?
Promise not to tell?
We are standing by a wishing well
Make a wish into the well
That's all you have to do
And if you hear it echoing
Your wish will soon come true
- I'm wishing
- I'm wishing
For the one I love
- To find me
- To find me
- Today
- Today
- I'm hoping
- I'm hoping
And I'm dreaming of
- The nice things
- The nice things
- He'll say
- He'll say
- I'm wishing
- I'm wishing
For the one I love
- To find me
- To find me
- Today
- Today
- Oh!
- Hello.
- Oh.
- Did I frighten you?
Wait! Wait, please.
Don't run away.
Now that I've found you
Hear what I have to say
One song
I have but one song
One song only for you
One heart tenderly beating
Ever entreating
Constant and true
One love
That has possessed me
One love
Thrilling me through
One song
My heart keeps singing
Of one love
Only for you
Take her far into the forest.
Find some secluded glade where she can pick wildflowers.
Yes, Your Majesty.
And there, my faithful Huntsman, you will kill her!
But, Your Majesty, the little Princess!
Silence!
You know the penalty if you fail.
Yes, Your Majesty.
But to make doubly sure you do not fail, bring back her heart in this.
One song,
I have but one song
Hello there.
What's the matter?
Where's your mama and papa?
Why, I believe you're lost.
Oh, please don't cry.
Come on, perk up.
Won't you smile for me?
That's better.
Your mama and papa can't be far.
There they are!
Can you fly?
Good-bye. Good-bye!
I can't, I can't do it.
Forgive me.
I beg of Your Highness, forgive me.
I don't understand!
She's mad, jealous of you!
She'll stop at nothing!
- But, but who?
- The Queen.
- The Queen?
- Now, quick, child, run.
Run away, hide!
In the woods! Anywhere!
Never come back!
Now, go. Go! Go!
Run! Run! Hide!
Oh!
Please don't run away.
I won't hurt you.
I'm awfully sorry.
I didn't mean to frighten you.
But you don't know what I've been through.
And all because I was afraid.
I'm so ashamed of the fuss I've made.
What do you do when things go wrong?
Oh! You sing a song!
With a smile and a song
Life is just like a bright, sunny day
Your cares fade away
And your heart is young
With a smile and a song
All the world seems to waken anew
Rejoicing with you
As the song is sung
There's no use in grumbling
When raindrops come tumbling
Remember you're the one
Who can fill the world with sunshine
When you smile and you sing
Everything is in tune and it's spring
And life flows along
With a smile and a song
I really feel quite happy now.
I'm sure I'll get along somehow.
Everything's going to be all right.
But I do need a place to sleep at night.
I can't sleep in the ground like you or in a tree the way you do.
And I'm sure no nest would possibly be big enough for me.
Maybe you know where I can stay.
In the woods somewhere?
You do?
Will you take me there?
Oh, it's adorable!
Just like a doll's house.
I like it here.
Ooh, it's dark inside.
Guess there's no one home.
Hello?
May I come in?
Shh!
Oh!
What a cute little chair!
Why, there's seven little chairs!
Must be seven little children.
And from the look of this table, seven untidy little children.
A pickaxe. A stocking, too!
And a shoe!
And just look at that fireplace.
It's covered with dust.
And look, cobwebs everywhere!
My, my, my!
What a pile of dirty dishes!
And just look at that broom!
Why, they've never swept this room.
You'd think their mother would...
Maybe they have no mother.
Then they're orphans.
That's too bad.
I know!
We'll clean the house and surprise them.
Then maybe they'll let me stay.
Now, you wash the dishes.
You tidy up the room.
You clean the fireplace.
And I will use the broom.
Just whistle while you work
And cheerfully together we can tidy up the place
So hum a merry tune
It won't take long when there's a song to help you set the pace
And as you sweep the room
Imagine that the broom
Is someone that you love and soon you'll find you're dancing to the tune
Oh, no, no, no, no! Put them in the tub.
When hearts are high the time will fly
So whistle while you work
Uh-uh, uh-uh!
Not under the rug.
So whistle while you work
We dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig
In our mine the whole day through
To dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig is what we like to do
It ain't no trick to get rich quick
If ya dig, dig, dig with a shovel or a pick
- In a mine
- In a mine
Where a million diamonds
- Shine
We dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig
From early morn 'til night
We dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig up everything in sight
We dig up diamonds by the score
A thousand rubies
Sometimes more
Though we don't know what we dig 'em for
We dig, dig, dig-a-dig, dig

Oh, what adorable little beds!
And look, they have their names carved on them.
Doc, Happy,
Sneezy, Dopey...
What funny names for children!
Grumpy, Bashful and Sleepy.
I'm a little sleepy myself.

Look!
Our house! The lit's light...
Uh, the light's lit.
Jiminy Crickets!
The door is open.
The chimney's smoking.
Something's in there.
- Maybe a ghost.
- Or a goblin.
- A demon.
Or a dragon.
Mark my words, there's trouble a-brewin'.
Felt it coming all day. My corns hurt.
- Gosh!
- That's a bad sign.
What'll we do?
- Let's sneak up on it.
Yes.
We'll, uh, squeak up... Sneak up.
Come on, hen... Uh, men. Follow me.
Psst!
Shh!
Shh!
Careful, men.
Search every cook and nanny...
Hook and granny...
Crooked fan...
Search everywhere.
Shh!
Quiet.
Look! The floor, it's been swept!
Hah!
Chair's been dusted!
Our window's been washed.
Gosh, our cobwebs are missing.
Why, why, why, why, the whole place is clean!
There's dirty work afoot.
Sink's empty.
Hey, someone stole our dishes!
They ain't stole.
They're hid in the cupboard.
My cup's been washed.
Sugar's gone.
Something's cooking.
Smells good!
Don't touch it, you fools!
Might be poison.
See? It's witches' brew.
Look what's happened to our stable... Uh, table.
Flowers!
- Huh?
- Look, goldenrod.
Don't do it. Take them away.
My nose! My hay fever!
You know I can't stand it.
I can't... I can't... I... Oh.
Ah...
Ahhh...
Thanks!
Hey!
Shh!
Ya crazy fool!
Fine time you picked to sneeze!
I couldn't help it. I can't tell.
When you gotta, you gotta.
I... I... I gotta.
It's coming.
- Don't let him.
- Stop him.
Oh! Ah... Ah... Ah!
- No, tie it tight.
- Don't let go.
- Hold him tight.
- I'll tie it.
Make a hard knot.
There, that will hold him.
- Thanks!
- Shh!
Quiet, you fool!
You want to get us all killed?
- What's that?
- That's it.
- Sounded close.
- It's in this room right now.
- It's up there.
- Yeah. In the bedroom.
One of us has gotta go down and chase it up.
Up. Down.
Here, take it.
Don't be nervous.
Don't be afraid. We're right behind you.
Yes! Right behind ya.
Here it comes!
- It's after us.
- Don't let it out.
Hold it shut.
- Here it comes.
- Now's our chance.
Get it now!
- Quick!
- Give it to it!
Don't let it get away!
Hold on there. It's only Dopey.
- Did you see it?
- How big is it?
- Was it a dragon?
- Has it got horns?
- Was it breathing fire?
- Was it droolin'?
What was it doin'?
He says it's a, a monster asleep in our beds!
- Let's attack.
- While it's sleeping.
Yeah, while it's sleeping.
- Hurry, men. It's now or never!
- Off with its head.
- Break its bones.
- Chop it to pieces.
We'll kill it dead.
- Jiminy Crickets!
- Gosh!
- Gee!
- What a monster!
It covers three beds.
Let's kill it before it wakes up.
- Which end do we kill?
- Shh!
Shh!
Well, eh, ah...
- What is it?
- Why, it... It's a girl!
She's mighty purdy.
She's beautiful, just like a angel.
Angel, hah! She's a female!
And all females is poison!
They're full of wicked wiles.
What are wicked wiles?
I don't know. But I'm agin 'em.
Shh!
Not so loud. You'll wake her up.
Aw, let her wake up!
She don't belong here nohow.
- Look out.
- She's movin'.
- She's wakin' up.
- What'll we do?
Hide.
Oh, dear.
I wonder if the children are...
Oh!
Why, why, you're little men!
How do you do?
- I said, how do you do?
- How do you do what?
Oh, you can talk! I'm so glad!
Now, don't tell me who you are.
Let me guess.
I know, you're Doc.
Why, why, why, yes.
Yes! That's true.
And you're, you're Bashful.
Oh, gosh!
And you, you're Sleepy.
How'd you guess?
And you?
And you're Sneezy.
- Yes, and you must be...
- Happy, ma'am. That's me.
And this is Dopey. He don't talk none.
You mean he can't talk?
He don't know. He never tried.
Oh, that's too bad.
Oh!
You must be Grumpy.
Oh, yes! Yes!
Hah! We know who we are.
Ask her who she is and what she's a-doin' here.
Hmph! Yeah!
What are you and who are you doin'?
What are you... Who are you, my dear?
Oh, how silly of me. I'm Snow White.
Snow White?
The Princess?
Yes.
Well... Well, my, my dear Quincess... Uh, Princess.
We're, uh, we're honored.
Yes, we're, uh, we're...
- Mad as hornets!
- Mad as hornets! No, no, we're not.
We're bad as cornets...
No, no, as bad as... What was I sayin'?
Nothing! Just standin' there sputterin' like a doodlebug!
Who, who, who, who's butterin' like a spoodledug?
- Who's... Uh, gutter...
- Aw, shut up and tell her to get out!
Please don't send me away!
- If you do, she'll kill me.
Kill you?
Who will?
Yes, who?
- My stepmother, the Queen.
The Queen?
- She's wicked!
- She's bad!
- She's mighty mean!
- She's an old witch!
I'm warnin' ya.
If the Queen finds her here, she'll swoop down and wreak her vengeance on us!
But she doesn't know where I am!
She don't, eh? She knows everything.
She's full of black magic.
She can even make herself invisible.
Pfft!
Might be in this room right now.
Oh, she'll never find me here.
And if you let me stay,
I'll keep house for you.
I'll wash and sew and sweep and cook and...
Cook?
Can you make dapple lumpkins...
Uh, lumple dapplins?
Apple dumplings!
- Eh, yes!
Crapple dumpkins.
Yes, and plum pudding and gooseberry pie...
Gooseberry pie?
Hooray! She stays!
Ah!
Soup!
Hooray!
Uh-uh, uh-uh!
Just a minute.
Supper's not quite ready.
You'll just have time to wash.
Wash? Wash?
- Wash? Wash? Wash?
- Hah! Knew there was a catch to it.
- Why wash?
- What for? We ain't goin' nowhere.
'Tain't New Year's.
Oh, perhaps you have washed.
Perhaps we...
- Yes! Perhaps we have.
- But when?
When? When. Uh, you said whe...
Why, last week.
Why, recently!
Yes, recently!
Oh, recently!
Let me see your hands.
Let me see your hands!
Why, Doc, I'm surprised!
Come on, let's see them.
Oh, Bashful, my, my, my!
And you?
Worse than I thought!
Oh!
How shocking!
Goodness me, this will never do.
March straight outside and wash, or you'll not get a bite to eat.
Hah!
Well, aren't you going to wash?
What's the matter?
Cat got your tongue?
Oh! Did you hurt yourself?
Hah, women!
Courage, men, courage.
Don't be nervous.
Gosh, it's wet!
It's cold, too!
We ain't gonna do it, are we?
Well, it'll please the Princess.
I'll take a chance for her!
Me, too!
Hah! Her wiles are beginnin' to work.
But I'm warnin' ya, you give 'em an inch, and they'll walk all over ya!
Don't listen to that old warthog.
Come on now, men.
- How hard do ya scrub?
- Will our whiskers shrink?
Do ya get in the tub?
Do ya have to wash where it doesn't show?
Now, now, now, don't get excited.
Here we go.
Step up to the tub
'Tain't no disgrace
Just pull up your sleeves and get 'em in place
Then scoop up the water and rub it on your face and go...
Pick up the soap
Now don't try to bluff
Work up a lather
And when you got enough
Get your hands full of water and you snort and you snuff and go...
You douse and you souse
Rub and you scrub
You sputter and splash all over the tub
You may be cold and wet when you're done
But you gotta admit it's good and clean fun
So splash all you like
'Tain't any trick
As soon as you're through
You'll feel mighty slick
Bunch of old nanny goats.
Ya make me sick going...
Hah! Next thing ya know she'll be tyin' your beards up in pink ribbons and smellin' ya up with that stuff called "perfoom. "
Hah!
A fine bunch of water lilies you turned out to be.
I'd like to see anybody make me wash if I didn't wanna.
Get him!
Hey, let go of me!
Get him over to the tub.
Get him over to the tub.
Let me loose, you fools! Let me loose!
Get him up on the tub. Get him up!
Hang on to him! Bang him! Pound him!
Get him up on the tub! On the tub.
That's the tub. That's the tub.
Don't, don't, don't, don't get excited!
Don't get... Don't get up... Don't get...
Get the soap!
Hey, steady, men.
- We'll get him there. We'll get him.
Never say die. Never say die.
You don't...
Now, scrub good and hard
It can't be denied
That he'll look mighty cute as soon as he's dried
Well, it's good for the soul
And it's good for the hide to go...
Ain't he sweet?
Smells like a petunia.
He sure is cute!
You'll pay dearly for this!
Supper!
- Supper!
Food. Hooray!
Hah!
Magic Mirror on the wall, who now is the fairest one of all?
Over the seven jeweled hills beyond the seventh fall, in the cottage of the seven dwarfs dwells Snow White, fairest one of all.
Snow White lies dead in the forest.
The Huntsman has brought me proof.
Behold her heart.
Snow White still lives, the fairest in the land.
'Tis the heart of a pig you hold in your hand.
The heart of a pig!
Then I've been tricked!
The heart of a pig!
The blundering fool!
I'll go myself to the dwarfs' cottage in a disguise so complete no one will ever suspect.
Now, a formula to transform my beauty into ugliness, change my queenly raiment to a peddler's cloak.
Mummy Dust to make me old.
To shroud my clothes, the black of night.
To age my voice, an old hag's cackle.
To whiten my hair, a scream of fright.
A blast of wind to fan my hate!
A thunderbolt
To mix it well.
Now, begin thy magic spell.
Look!
My hands!
My voice!
My voice.
A perfect disguise.
And now...
A special sort of death for one so fair.
What shall it be?
Ah!
A poisoned apple!
Sleeping Death.
I'd like to dance and tap my feet
But they won't keep in rhythm
You see, I washed 'em both today and I can't do nothin' with 'em
Ho-hum, the tune is dumb
The words don't mean a thing
Isn't this a silly song for anyone to sing?
I...
Oh, gosh!
I chased a polecat up a tree
Way out upon a limb
And when he got the best of me
I got the worst of him
Ho-hum, the tune is dumb
The words don't mean a thing
Isn't this a silly song for anyone to sing?
Watch out. Be ca... Watch... Watch...
Watch... Watch...
Thanks.
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey!
Hooray!
That was fun!
Now you do something.
Well, what shall I do?
- Tell us a story.
Yes, tell us a story.
- A true story.
- A love story.
Well, once there was a princess.
Was the princess you?
- And she fell in love.
- Was it hard to do?
Oh, it was very easy.
Anyone could see that the Prince was charming.
The only one for me.
Was he strong and handsome?
Was he big and tall?
There's nobody like him anywhere at all.
Did he say he loved ya?
Did he steal a kiss?
He was so romantic
I could not resist
Some day my prince will come
Some day we'll meet again
And away to his castle we'll go
To be happy forever
I know
Hah! Mush!
Some day when spring is here
We'll find our love anew
And the birds will sing
And wedding bells will ring
Some day when my dreams
Come true
Oh, my goodness!
It's past bedtime.
Go right upstairs to bed.
Wait! Hold on there, men!
The, uh, Princess will sleep in our beds upstairs.
But where will you sleep?
Oh, we'll be quite comfortable down here in... in...
In a pig's eye!
In a pig's eye... Sty. No, no! I mean...
We'll be comfortable, won't we, men?
Oh, yes. Mighty comfortable.
Now don't you worry about us.
We'll be all right, ma'am.
Go right on up now, my dear.
Well, if you insist.
Good night.
Good night, Princess.
You're sure you'll be comfortable?
Oh, yes. Very comfortable.
Well, pleasant dreams.
Pleasant dreams.
Let go!
- I saw it first!
Now, men, don't get excited.
Remember, share.
It's share and share alike.
Look out, it'll rip. It'll rip!
Bless the seven little men who have been so kind to me.
And... And may my dreams come true.
Amen.
Oh, yes!
And please make Grumpy like me.
Hah! Women!
A fine kettle of fish!
Dip the apple in the brew.
Let the Sleeping Death seep through!
Look! On the skin!
The symbol of what lies within.
Now, turn red to tempt Snow White.
To make her hunger for a bite.
Have a bite?
It's not for you.
It's for Snow White.
When she breaks the tender peel to taste the apple in my hand, her breath will still, her blood congeal.
Then I'll be fairest in the land!
But wait!
There may be an antidote.
Nothing must be overlooked.
Oh, here it is!
"Love's First Kiss. "
Bah!
No fear of that.
The dwarfs will think she's dead.
She'll be buried alive!
Buried alive!
Thirsty?
Have a drink!
Now, don't forget, my dear.
The... The old Queen's a sly one, full of witchcraft.
So beware of strangers.
Don't worry. I'll be all right.
See you tonight.
Uh, yes. We... Well, c'mon, men.
Be awful careful
'cause if anything'd happen to you, I, I...
- Good-bye.
- Oh, gosh!
Hah! Disgustin'!
And be sure to watch out...
To wa... To wa...
To wa...
Watch out.
Thanks.
Well... All right.
But that's the last... Wha...
Oh, go on. Run along.
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
It's off to work we go
Heigh-ho
Good-bye! Good-bye!
Now I'm warnin' ya.
Don't let nobody or nothin' in the house.
Why, Grumpy, you do care.
Hah!
Good-bye, Grumpy!
The little men will be away and she'll be all alone with a harmless old peddler woman.
A harmless old peddler woman!
Some day my prince will come
Some day we'll meet again
And away to his castle we'll go
To be happy forever I know
Some day when spring is here
We'll find our love anew
And the birds will sing
And wedding bells will ring
Some day when my dreams
Come true
All alone, my pet?
Why, why, yes, I am. But...
The, the little men are not here?
No, they're not, but...
Mmm-hmm.
Making pies?
Yes, gooseberry pies.
It's apple pies that make the menfolks' mouths water.
Pies made from apples like these.
- Oh, they do look delicious.
- Yes!
But wait 'til you taste one, dearie.
Like to try one?
Hmm?
Go on. Go on, have a bite.
Stop it! Stop it! Go away! Go away!
Shame on you, frightening a poor old lady.
Oh, I thought I'd lost it.
There, there. I'm sorry.
Oh! My heart!
Oh, my... My poor heart.
Take me into the house and let me rest.
A drink of water, please.
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
It's off to work we go
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
Hey, look!
- Stop that!
- Get away, boy. Get away! Go on, shoo!
Go on! Get outta here!
What ails these crazy birds?
They've gone plumb daffy.
Yeah, they've...
And because you've been so good to poor old Granny,
I'll share a secret with you.
This is no ordinary apple.
It's a magic wishing apple.
A wishing apple?
Yes!
One bite and all your dreams will come true.
- Really?
- Yes, girlie.
Now, make a wish and take a bite.
- Go on, get!
- These pesky critters won't stop.
- 'Tain't natural.
There's something wrong.
They ain't actin' this way for nothin'.
Maybe the old Queen's got Snow White.
- The Queen!
Snow White!
The Queen'll kill her!
We gotta save her!
Yes! Yes! We, we, we gotta save her!
- She'll kill her!
- What'll we do?
Yes, yes, what'll we do?
Come on! Giddap!
Wait for me! Wait for...
There must be something your little heart desires.
Perhaps there's someone you love.
Well, there is someone.
I thought so. I thought so!
Old Granny knows a young girl's heart.
Now, take the apple, dearie, and make a wish.
I wish... I wish...
That's it, go on! Go on.
And that he will carry me away to his castle where we will live happily ever after.
Fine! Fine! Now take a bite.
Don't let the wish grow cold!
Oh, I feel strange.
- Her breath will still.
- Oh. Oh.
- Her blood congeal.
- Oh.
Now I'll be fairest in the land!
Hurry, hurry.
There she goes!
After her!
I'm trapped! What will I do?
The meddling little fools!
I'll fix ya. I'll fix ya.
I'll fix ya! I'll crush your bones!
Look out!
One song
One song
I have but one song
- One song
- One song
- Only for you
- For you
One heart
Tenderly beating
Ever entreating
- Constant and true
- So true
- One love
- One love
That has possessed me
- One love
- One love
- Thrilling me through
- So true
- One song
- One song
- My heart keeps singing
- Keeps singing
- Of one love
- One love
Only for you...
And away to his castle you'll go
To be happy forever we know
Good-bye.
Good-bye, Grumpy.
Good-bye.
Oh, Dopey.
Good-bye!
Some day when spring is here
We'll find our love anew
And the birds will sing
And wedding bells will ring
Some day when my dreams
Come true!

And this book is Paul Whiteman's scrapbook.
Its pages are crowded with melodies and anecdotes which we are going to bring to life for you by the magic of the camera.
Here we have Paul himself.
And by the way, you may be interested in knowing how he came to be crowned the King of Jazz.
Once upon a time Paul, tiring of life in the great city, had a grand idea - he would go big-game hunting.
No sooner said than done.
Suiting the action to the camera, we find him a few weeks later in darkest Africa.

Where's the band?
Are you standing in front of them?
- Oh, the band?
- Yes.
I have them right in here.
What, 40 boys in that little bag?
In the bag.
I'm really very proud of the boys.
Some of them have been in the band for a great many years.
- Mike, how long have you been in the band?
- Eleven years, Mr. Whiteman.
Goldie, how long have you been in the band?
Six years, Pop.
- “Six years, Pop"?
- Pop.
Been in the band so long he's commenced to look like me.
However, as I said before, I'm really very proud of the boys collectively and I'd like to have you meet them individually.
Now that you know the boys,
I want you to meet our girls.
We call our next advertisement
“The Bridal Veil."
It tells the story of a little girl who finds in an old treasure chest
the laced veil that had been worn by her ancestors.
The ghost brides of all the ages pass before her
and, in fancy, the boy who was to become her future husband joins her
and they start on their honeymoon to the land of dreams.
Of course they lived happy ever after.

Hey, Bing, this isn't the type of number for this kind of a production.
- What kind of production is this?
- A super-super, special-special production!
Well, I guess you're right.
We should get out of the mud and reach for the higher and the finer things of life - the silver lining and the bluebird and life and love.

- Now I've caught you.
- But I -
So this is the way you act when I'm not around.
- Well, I -
- No use in trying to explain.
- I saw you with my own eyes.
- Well, why won't you let me -
I'm through!
You'll never see me again as long as you live, you brute.
Good-bye!
Well, wifey, there goes the best stenographer I ever had.
The next page in the scrapbook was inserted one day while Paul was away.
And the boys in the band prevailed upon the property man to do his stuff.
Jack White, a fellow of infinite jest,
But just a little bit nutty.
Come on there, Old Black Joe!
Yeah, Joe, come on.
You'll be terrific.

I had a funny dream last night.
I dreamt I saw two fishes fight.
The champion was a tuna fish.
His opponent was a bass.
Before the title fight began they introduced a few.
They introduced Kid Sharkey.
Battling Whitefish.
And Piccolo Pete.
Ahh!
- Ace of clubs?
- Right!
The house was packed with poor fish who paid 20 fish to get in.
And now they're madly yelling for the main fight to begin.
Everyone's excited.
In the gallery, some fresh trout -
Come on, you tuna fish!
Knock his teeth out now!
The champion leads his left fin.
He leads it to the jaw.
He lands!
The bass, he flounders.
- Catch on?
- Oh, we get it, we get it.
The signal’s off.
The bass went down. He can't get up.
The champ is in his glory.
And then I woke to find my dream was only a bedtime story.

No record of American music would be complete without George Gershwin's
Rhapsody in Blue, which was written for the Whiteman Orchestra and first played in the Aeolian Hall in 1924.
The most primitive and the most modern musical elements are combined in this rhapsody, for jazz was born in the African jungle to the beating of the voodoo drum.
- Oh, good evening, Mr. Kent.
- Hello, Wally.
- What are you gonna have?
- Oh, I don't know.
Most anything.
Thanks. What is that?
Just what you ordered - most anything.
Well, here's a go, here's a go.
You know what’s the matter with this country?
It's a tariff.
That's who.
Partly tariff and partly income tax.
Now, you take my wife.
All right. Who you gonna take?
Here's a go, here's a go, here's a go.
Wait a minute. Don't kick that dog.
That's not a dog.
It's a cat.
Well, don't - Then don't kick the cat.
- Don't you like animals?
- No.
Do you like goldfish?
Goldfish? I hate 'em!
Whew. Nat so quiet. Not so quiet.
My boy, don't ever let anybody hear you talk that way.
A goldfish is one of the most faithful animals we have.
To mankind.
To the goldfish.
Would you mind if I told you a story about two little goldfish that I once had?
No.
I bought 'em at a spawn shop.
Two little walli - walli - uh - goldfish.
I call 'em Ella and Emma.
I brought them home and put them in a glass bowl full of water.
And I used to sit and watch them grow, grow into women, into men -
Big fish.
Then prohibition came, and they jumped out of the bowl onto the floor.
They used to follow me around wherever I went.
How I used to love them.
I used to come home each night and I'd stand at the bottom of the steps and I'd cry out,
“Hello, Ella!
Hello, Emma!"
And they would answer me back -
One day I'd been working very hard.
I worked so hard, I broke my shovel.
I came home, and I stood at the bottom of the steps, and I cried out...
“Hello-lo-lo-lo, Ella!
Hello, hello, Emma!"
But there was no -
No -
Ella! Emma!
Emma!

Say, Charlie, what's the big idea?
Don't you think I'm entitled to a little consideration?
What for, Paul? After all is said and done, it's dancing that puts a number over.
All you do is stand back there, wave a little stick, and form a background.
And what a background.
How do you know that I can't dance?
You don't mean to tell me that you're well-versed in the intricacies of the an of Terpsichore?
No, but I can dance.
Charlie, I have a secret confession.
Ever since I've been a little fellow,
I've been able to dance, oh, quite well.
Ever since I was about - oh, about so high.
Yeah, but how wide?
Ouch.
You really want to dance?
All right, Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Paul Whiteman will now dance, so help me, Bob.
