Why are they sending so many soldiers daddy, if it is only going to be a little war.
Make those southern boys take us seriously this time, my darlilng.
When they realize how much we want to put a stop to their nonsense, they'll quiet down.
They'd better. Anyhow, when you get there, you'll stop them won't you daddy?
I'll do my best dear.
We will miss you so.
I'll be back and we'll be together again before you can say knife.
I can say knife a good many times in a year.
At school, you'll have charming little girls to play with.....
....books to read, a pony to ride and after all there will be Emily you know.
Yes, there will be Emily. And she does look as though she'd be an understanding friend, don't you think daddy?
With that intelletual look, I'm sure of it.
- Not a very cheeful looking school, is it daddy?
- I'm afraid nothing would seem very cheerful to us at the moment.
Well, maybe it will be better on the inside.
- Of course it will. I'm sorry sir.
- All right, get it out.
- The very idea of delivering a thing like this to the front door.
- Oh look daddy, my pony.
Your employer will answer to this.
Now take him away. Yes, far away!
- Oh no daddy.
- Oh, I say. Just a moment.
- You are Miss Minchin?
- I am.
I'm Captain Crew.
- I'm afraid of caused you no end to inconvenience.
- You most certainly have, Captain Crew.
- May I step inside and explain?
- Come in.
- Wait here, I'm returning.
- Very well Captain.
-I'm terribly sorry. I had no intention of having the pony delivered inside your house.
- There are a number of things besides the pony.
Parcels have been arriving here collect for your daughter for hours.
Follow me please.
Apparently you are not aware,
Captain Crew, that I conduct one of the most exclusive schools in London.
Yes, yes, I understood. That is precisely the reason why I brought my daughter to you.
- I would not have gathered that, by your actions.
- Really now, I'm not entirely to blame.
You see Sara and I, only just arrived from India. Sara has lived there practically all her life.
We no more than got here, when I learned that my regiment was to leave at once for
South Africa, so we had to act in a hurry.
But I wrote you and explained that l do not take young ladies without an interview and impecable references.
I wrote you also, that at the moment, I have no vacant room.
- Well in that case daddy, we may as well move on.
- This is a bit awkward.
You see, your letter never reached me and
I'm afraid it never occured to me that any school wouldn't welcome my little Sara.
If it is a question of my social standing, my father was Sir George
Crew. You've heard of him, perhaps?
And the best financial references l can give you would be the director of the South African Holding Syndicate.
I'm the principal stockholder in the syndicate.
My brother, Captain Crew, a professor of dramatics.
- How do you do?
- Charmed, I'm sure.
- I say, isn't the Eclipse Diamond mines one of your holdings?
- One of the most important.
I'm sorry to appear casual Miss Minchin, but the siutation is quite distressing. I sail in an hour to the east Indian docks.
- I expect you'll just have to take me to Africa with you daddy. - Well, well and what would a little girl like you do in Africa?
Forgive me Captain Crew. I'm afraid I've been over zealous. The reputation of my school you know. One has to be so cautious.
But after this interview, I can see at a glance, she's a dear little child.
- It'll be a pleasure to have her with us.
- Does that mean I've got to stay?
Yes dear. You are to have that privilege. You and your little pony.
- What a dear little pony.
- This is made out to the school.
- Is it enough for the moment.
- Oh quite.
- I should say it would. Why it's stupendous.
- I beg your pardon, but haven't I seen you somewhere before?
- Quite possible my dear Captain.
Your face is most familiar. Were you ever on the stage? I seem to associate you with one of the old music halls.
- Musicals? My brother on the stage? Ridiculous.
- Ridiculous indeed, you're quite right.
And now, shall we look at little
Sara's room?
Just a moment Miss Rose. This is
Miss Rose, one of my most capable teachers.
Captain Crew has done us the honor of placing his little daughter
Sara with us.
How do you do Miss Rose? How do you do
Captain Crew? We shall do everything we can to make your little girl happy.
Children, we have a new pupil.
Sara Crew. Say how do you do to her.
-How do you do?
- I'm very well, thank you.
Lavina, Jesse, that will do. You may proceed Miss Rose.
- She's just like a little princess, isn't she?
- That's what she is, a princess.
I expect now, some people around here won't think they're so smart.
Oh won't they? Wait and see!
Princess indeed!
Fortunately, the room has just been papered and the fireplace has an excellent draft.
- But I thought you didn't have any rooms?
- I didn't know then what a dear little girl was coming.
Why does that make more rooms daddy?
Lady Bengiglis daughter has only recently vacated the room. Our best suite of course.
Do you think you could brighten it up a bit? I'd like it made as gay as possible. brought a few things from India.
Perhaps you could buy whatever else is necessary.
With pleasure Captain Crew.
- I'd like Sara to ride every afternoon, if that is all right. Of course.
- Fortunately we have a splendid riding master.
I expect you think I am completely spoiling the child. No doubt you're right, but actually it's good for her.
She's much too inclined to bury her cute little nose in a book and keep it there until someone lures her out of it.
You see Miss Minchin. Sara has no mother and we've never been separated for more than a few days.
- How touching.
- This is going to be very hard for her.
Have no fear Captain Crew. I'm a mother to all my little girls.
And now, I'll leave you to your farewells.
- How much longer have we got, daddy?
- Only a few minutes, darling.
-You know me by heart little Sara.
- No daddy, I know you by heart.
You're inside my heart.
We're going to be brave, aren't we?
I'll tell you what. Let's pretend we're back in India.
And I'm going away with the troop for a few days. Shall we?
We've fought this kind of battle before, haven't we? And you never cried once when I went away.
- Remember?
- Yes daddy.
But this is going to be our hardest battle.
- But we'll be good soldiers, won't we?
- Yes daddy.
- Shall we say good-bye, like we used to at home?
- Yes daddy.
All right then. Chin up, go to the window and look out.
Say it as we used to.
My daddy has to go away, but he'll return most any day.
Any moment, I may see, my daddy coming back to me.
My daddy has to go away, but he'll return most any day.
I can't do it this time. I can't do it.
- You're crying too.
- I'm afraid that we aren't quite the good soldiers as we thought.
Oh yes we are.
I can do it now.
My daddy has to go away, but he'll return most any day.
Any moment I may see, my daddy coming back to me.
I will do it! I will! I'll pretend this is part of a war.
You be the enemy and you'll be my trusty lance. Now ready, aim, fi re.
I guess we'll have to call in the reserves.
-Good-morning.
- Misses speaks Hindu?
I've lived in India all my life.
Misses is going to live in England now?
- Until my father gets through with making the boars behave.
- Your father is a soldier?
Yes, my father is a captain. Captain
Crew. I'm Sara. What is your name?
I am Ram Dass. Servant to the
Honorable Lord Wickham and Lady Surani.
Ram Dass!
Why are you doddling here? Finish with that bird and get on with your work.
Good-morning.
How do you do?
I'm up here at the window almost every morning, in case you want to talk about India.
Good-morning Sara. Oh, good- morning. Are you ready for breakfast my dear?
Well, I'm trying to be, but I don't seem to be very good at these buttons. My thumb get lost in the holes.
Here, let me help you. Buttons are a bother, aren't they?
I've never had to button things before, but I'll learn.
Here, put your shoe up. Come in.
- Good-morning Becky.
- Good-morning.
- Has the young lady any boots to be done?
- Well, only the pair I wore yesterday, I'll get them.
I'll get them Miss. Oh I beg your pardon Miss!
- Are you hurt?
- No Miss you mustn't be helping me Miss.
- Just hold out your arms and I'll pile them on.
- Oh no Miss. If Miss Minchin was to see.....
- Think you can hold two more?
- Yes Miss.
There. There we are. Are you all right?
-You take care of all those?
- And she does them beautifully.
- I thank you Miss.
- Thank-you for doing my shoes.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- That's all right.
Good-bye Becky. Good-bye.
Well, perhaps this isn't going to be such a bad school after all. With you and Becky here.
Oh, we'll have to hurry dear. Miss
Minchin doesn't like anyone to be late.
Tell me Miss Rose. Do you think
Miss Minchin could be as cross as she looks?
- What will I have to do today?
- Well, after breakfast, you'll have a class of arithmatic.
Then English, then french, history and geography.
I'm going to be a busy person, aren't I? When do I get to ride my pony?
Later this afternoon. About 4 o'clock.
Children, our new pupil, Sara Crew will be down shortly.
As you've seen, Captain Crew is a very delightful man and their family is most distinguished.
I should expect you to treat her accordingly.
Now you may take your places.
- Good-morning.
- Ah, good-morning Sara.
- I'm so happy you feel like joining us this morning. Did you sleep well?
- No I didn't, thank-you.
Lavina, you and Jesse will move down one place.
-Sara will be seated at my right after this.
- Why Miss Minchin, this has always been my place.
For this food, and all thy bountiful gifts bestowed upon us, we are duly grateful and do now give thanks.
- Why are you putting salt on your plate my dear.
- Just in case you plan on asking me to have one of your eggs.
- Mr. Geoffrey. Shall I saddle the pony for the wee lassie? - I think not Sandy. We'd best use the mare for her first few lessons.
What luck. The old girl allowed you to come out.
Sara, this is Mr. Geoffrey Hamilton.
Miss Crew is our new pupil.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
I believe I am to teach you to ride.
And that means two bob extra to me.
- Is two bob a great deal of money?
- Values are comparative.
-In my present state, it's a fortune.
- Well, in that case, I guess I'd better be taught.
- Is my pony ready?
-I think we'd best start you off on something a little tamer.
Then hadn't I better explain things to my pony. He might feel hurt.
Right you are. Ponies are very sensitive creatures.
Explain the whole thing to him, thoroughly.
He's right there by the arch.
- It may take me some time. That's all right.
- We'll wait right here in the tac room.
Hello General.
Are you glad to see me?
Well if Mr. Geoffrey is going to give me something tamer than you, I'm afraid it's not going to be much of a ride.
- Rose something's wrong. What is it?
- Miss Minchin is taking away my
Thursday afternoons.
- But why?
- We must have been seen together.
- Well does that mean that I can never see you alone again? Of course not darling. - No matter what Miss Minchin says, we'll find a way.
I can't understand the woman.What is she afraid of? Why shouldn't we see one another.
Gossip I suppose. She only lives for that school the variety of the propriety of the snobbisheness.
Fiddlesticks. She's afraid of losing an excellent teacher whom she gets for nothing. I won't stand for it. I will have a talk with her myself.
No darling you mustn't do that.
She'd only discharge us both.
She may not have the chance if things continue to pop in South Africa.
- You mean you might go?
- Wouldn't you want me to if they call for volunteers?
Of course darling you'd have to.
There is nothing to worry about now. This poor rumpous will never get that serious.
I expect I'll have to make my visit a little longer.
- Oh Mr. Brady is there one this morning for the little princess?
- We'll see my child we shall see.
Of she don't hear from her father every so often her eyes get that sad it hurts me to look in them.
-Have no fear little one.
- There is a letter for her this time.
Oh i'm so glad sir.
-A letter?
- It's from my daddy.
-Oh how nice.
- But it isn't.
- It's very bad news. Really?
-What's the matter dear?
He says the boys are not behaving as expeted. And he may not get here in time for my birthday.
But that's months old. So many things may happen before then.He can still come.
I'm writing Miss Minchin to give you ar bithday party such as I should give you if I were there.
You are to go on a regular spree.
Buy anything and everthing your heart desires.
Now last and most important of all my darling....
...I want you to pause at exactly 2 o'clock on your birthday..
..close your eyes and send me a kiss.
For my eyes also will also be closed and I'll be giving you a kiss too.
Isn't he the most wonderful man in all the world?
- With one exception...
- Well Mr. Geoffrey is very nice.
What's that?
- Who are they Miss Rose?
- They are volunteers.
- Are they going to South Africa too?
- Yes dear, they're going to relieve our poor soldiers in Maefking.
- Is there something the matter with our soldiers in Mafeking?
- The boars have them all cut off.
We were unable to break through their lines and ger help to them.
They're sick and hungry dear and desprate. They're holding out like true British soldiers.
Miss Rose my daddy's at Mafeking.
Oh darling I'm so sorry. I didn't know.
Darling you mustn't cry. I'm sure he'll be all right.
- Good afternoon Mr. Geoffery.
- Good afternoon Madris. Is Miss
Sarah ready for her ride?
She'll be down presently. Thanks.
Oh, are we all ready?
The two most beautiful ladies in the world. Why aren't you in your riding things?
- Oh i can't go today. Ermegard needs extra tutoring today.
-Oh will it take all afternoon?
I'm afraid so.
- I have to stay with her until she can spell Constantiniopel.
- Heavens that may take months.
You leave that to me.
Shall we go? Have you been crying?
- But you have, there are still tears in your eyes.
- It's just this London fog.
Oh well if that's all, lets be off shall we?
-Mr. Geoffrey. Would you mind very much if we didn't ride today?
- Not at all dear. But may I ask why not?
I'd like to talk to you.
It's about Mafeking.Are the soldiers really starving, sickand cut off from everything?
- You see my father's there so I've got to know.
- Oh it's not as bad as all that.
They may not be having an easy time of that, but they're holding out. We're sending in fresh troops everyday you know?
- Why they'll be leaving Mafeking in no time at all. - It's getting harder everyday to pretend my father is safe.
Don't you worry. See here, I'll let you in on at litle secret.
I enlisted today and while I don't
Miss Rose to know quite yet, I'll be going over there quite shortly myself.
- To Mafeking? Well then perhaps you can help my father.
- We'll get him out.
What the blazes are you doing here? Answer me! What are you doing here?
- Don't be frightened Sara, it's only my grandfather.
- Don't you believe him young woman. I disowned him the day he was born.
- We're really very fond of each other. Of course we are.
- What?! We are nothing of the kind.
- As a favor to me, will you please stop shouting at my best paying pupil.
- Pupil? Paying? What are you talking about?
I am master of the horse in this exclusive seminary of the young ladies.
You take advantage of my absence to become a riding master? And next door to me own house?
- Where's your family pride boy?
-Well sir, one must eat, and family pride is a pretty thin diet.
- Oh, blackmail eh? You'll think I'll buy you off?
- I hadn't thought of that, but it's not a bad idea.
I'll see you hang drawn and quartered for that.
Wait till I see the woman who runs this school.
I'll put a spoke in your wheel.
Do! She loved to know that my grandfather is Lord Wickham. She probably raise my salary
- Miss Sara, Lord Wickham is coming.
- Then I'm going.
Insolent young pup! Just like his father. Riding master! Bah!
- Maybe you're fond of him, but I don't think he's very fond of you. - Oh he's harmless.
His bark is worse than his bite.
I should hope so. Why is he so mad at you?
Oh he isn't really. He was angry with my father. I'm mixed up in their quarrel.
What he really wants if for me to come begging to him for help. He'd be eating out of my hand if I would.
I don't think I'd care for him eating out of my hand.
- How would you like to have me eating out of your hand?
- You? Oh, that would be different.
Well I shall, if you do me a favor.
A very important one. Oh, could I?
I've got an idea that you are the only one in the world who could.
I want you to get Miss Rose to go shopping with you next Wednesday.
Shopping?
Well, shopping is as good an excuse for Miss Minchin.
Really? To Miss Rose?
And she said she would? Oh, that's wonderful!
- No, not a soul. Not even Emily.
- Good girl! Now we've got to go.
- I must do some prelimanary shopping.
- You don't have to tell me what for.
Something gold and shiny.
Right you are!
Come in.
- Come in.
- Miss Minchin, I wanted to ask you something.
- Oh, it's you. What do you want dear?
- I'm going to ask you a big favor. Yes?
Mr. Geoffrey leaving today for the war, he's been so very nice to me...
...I thought I ought to fill my social obligations by doing something nice for him. That's what you teach us, isn't it?
When someone shows you a kindness, you show them one in return.
Well doing something for Mr.
Geoffrey, scarcely comes under the rules of social obligations.
- But what is it that you want to do for him?
- May I have him for tea?
- Here? At the school?
- Oh couldn't I please? Since he's going away to war.
Well I suppose it would be for him, since he was one of the teachers. You need not mention this to the other young ladies, however.
No Miss Minchin. Thank-you Miss
Minchin. Oh Thank-you Miss Minchin!
- We must eat something after all the trouble little Sara has gone to.
- I think she'll understand.
- You've forgotten your ring.
- No I haven't....see?
I'm always afraid I'll forget and wear it in front of Miss Minchin. I did yesterday and fortunately for us, she didn't see it.
- Oh I'd love to tell the old girl.
-Can't do that yet darling. I know.
- Are you sorry you married me?
- As if you didn't know.
I only wanted you to tell me again.
Oh, my darling....
I'll be living this last week over every moment I'm away from you.
We won't be separated, will we?
Because I'll be living it over too.
- I thought you were having Mr.
Hamiliton to tea?
- I am, I mean I was but.....
- Who's in that room?
- Oh please don't go in there Miss Minchin.
- Miss Minchin, Miss Rose and I.....
- We were saying good-bye Miss Minchin.
- How dare you risk the reputation of my school in this manner. - Nothing has happened to damage your precious school's reputation.
-As a matter of fact Miss Rose and I.....
- Geoffrey! For my sake.
- Oh please Miss Minchin, it was all my fault. -Silence!
Since you are here to merely say good-bye, please do so, now.
Good-bye Geoffrey.
- Good-bye Mr. Geoffrey.
- Good-bye dear.
-Sara, I shall expect an explanation of this.
- Yes Miss Minchin.
As soon as I can think of one.
- They've been cornered like rats for 7 months.
- I say send more troops to
Mafeking if it takes every man in England.
- I'm with you.
- No! Nooooooooo!
Oh my boy, my boy, my boooooy....
They killed my boy.
I know soldiers are suppose to stand a lot and my daddy is a good soldier.
But they've waited so long for help.
Please do something about
Mafeking right away.
Or they'll all be lost and my daddy won't come back.
Mafeking is set free. Mafeking is set free.
Mafeking is set free. Mafeking is set free.
Oh thank-you for being so quick about it this time.
Get up, get up! Mafeking is set free.
Wake up everybody! Mafeking is set free.
- Oh Mr. Bertie! Did you hear?
Mafeking is set free!
- Yes darling, isn't it great news.
Oh Miss Rose, they're saved. My daddy and Mr. Geoffrey are saved.
- What's wrong? Nothing is wrong.
- Nothing, nothing, nothing!
Mafeking is set free.
Oh Miss Minchin, isn't it wonderful?
Can you hear the cheering?
- Oh Sara, I'm so glad for you.
- He's saved Becky! My daddy is saved!
Children, children! Attention please!
It is a happy circumstance that Sara's birthday should fall on a day that we are celebrating a glorious victory for Her Majesty's Army.
Now Sara. Will you explain to the children about your wishes for your birthday?
I'm very happy to have you here and I thought I would like to give presents today. Not just receive them.
I want to show how grateful I am my father has been rescued. Quiet children, quiet.
- Can we do the presents now?
- Yes, but your gift first Sara.
-This is for you. Oh thank-you Miss Minchin.
- Now all I need is to know how to sew.
And this from the entire school.
Here are pictures of your native India.
Oh thank-you ever and ever so much. I shouldn't have to pretend nearly so hard when I want to make believe I'm there.
-And now, would you like them to have their presents. - Yes, if you please.
And your names are all on them.
Here you are Miss Rose. Oh, how nice.
Now would you help with the other presents?
- Here you are Miss Rose. Oh, how nice.
Now would you help with the other presents?
- Oh how thoughtful Sara.
From one old trooper to another.
Me in younger and happier days.
I was better known as Bobbling Bertie.
- Thank-you. We'd better keep this present a secret.
- Mums the word.
-Here this is from me. I hope you like it.
-It's just what I wanted.
Mums the word you know.
Here's my present Miss. Many
Happy Returns.
- Oh thank-you Becky.
- The material isn't new.
-Why you dear Becky, you made it all yourself.
- Yes Miss. I made it at nights.
I knew you could pretend, I said, with diamond pins stuck in.
- It's beautiful Becky, I shall love it.
Oh will you Miss?
- The material isn't all new.
- And this isn't so very new either.
- It's my present to you.
- Yes Becky, with my love.
- What is it Miss?
It's a scarab from Egypt. My daddy gave it to me, because it brings good luck.
I'd rather you had it, than anyone else I know.
- Oh my Miss. I think I'm going to faint.
- Oh no Becky! Not now.
I have lots more presents for you.
Two in my room.
-I don't know what to say Miss.
- You're sweet Becky.
Yes, yes, very nice.
- eg your pardon Miss. Yes? Mr. Barrow of
Barrow and Skippo is here to see you.
- Today? I didn't send for him.
He seems very much upset about something. He's waiting in your office.
-Miss Rose.
- The scarf is beautiful.
Miss Rose, remember to be sure and tell me when it's almost 2 o'clock.
You know, I have a very special appointment with my daddy. He's going to be thinking of me at exactly 2.
- I'll watch the time. Thank-you Miss Rose.
- Oh Sara! Thank-you for the handkerchiefs, they're lovely.
- Don't you think it's time to cut the cake?
-Oh yes, the cake!
- Please be seated Mr. Barrow.
- How much did you advance for this party? Quite a sum, I suspect.
What does it matter. Captain Crew is a very wealthy man. His check will be here shortly.
- No Miss Minchin. There'll be no check.
- What? What do you mean by that?
The late Captain Crew..... The
"late" Captain Crew?!
Captain Crew is dead. He was so reported in the list this morning.
Moreover, he died bankrupt
-Bankrupt?! But his property, his mines.
- His property and mines were confiscated by the enemy.
You mean to tell me that that child is penniless? That she's left on my hands with nothing?
She's certainly left penniless and she's certainly left on your hands.
- She hasn't a relative in the world that we know of.
- But her father's account is overdrawn.
I was expecting a check, and advanced the money for this party.
So I understand.
Now you have to make a wish and blow out all the candles with one breath.
My wish is that my father will come back real soon.
Now take a big breath.
I haven't got very good lungs, have I?
-I'll turn her out on the streets
-Do you think that's wise Miss
Minchin. The reputation of your school.
My school?
Well the report might get about and it might not sound well to the parents of your other pupils.
Yes, that is so.
Of course, the child can be made to serve in your employ, until her indebtedness is worked out.
- But that will take years.
- Quite so, but at least it is better than nothing.
Hurry children, your ice-cream is melting.
- Tara, it's almost 2 o'clock darling.
- Thank-you Miss Rose.
Oh daddy, I'm thinking of you.
And I know, wherever you are, you're thinking of me too.
Oh Miss Rose. I felt him with me,
I really did!
Miss Minchin wants you dear. Oh, all right.
- Children, you will leave your gifts here.
- Why? Where are they going?
-Why can't they take the presents with them?
- Because they are not yours to give.
- But I don't understand.
- You will later. Go to your room now.
- But Miss Minchin.
- Sara, go to your room.
All of you.
Now will you tell her what it's all about? What has happened Miss Minchin? Whatever it is, you may want to let her off a bit easier.
Silence! Captain Crew is dead. His name appeared on the list today.
He left the child a pauper. Oh Miss
Minchin. You had better tell her.
- Oh, I couldn't do that.
- You will do as you are told.
Oh Miss Rose. What's wrong?
Why did Miss Minchin stop the party?
Sara, I want to talk to you dear.
- Oh darling........
-Oh Miss Rose! What is it?
Sara, you're a soldier's daughter.....
.....and you know that means being brave and courageous, don't you?
No matter what happens.
- Oh Miss Rose! Is it something awful?
- Your father.....
But my father is all right. Mafeking is set free. You heard them say so.
Help didn't get there soon enough dear, for him. His name appeared on the list this morning.
- You mean with the wounded?
- No dear.
My daddy is...
Oh Sara, I'm so sorry.
It can't be! It isn't true! I won't believe it! He isn't dead! He isn't!
- Have you?
- Yes.
You may go.
You may go.
Come with me.
This is to be your room in the future.
I shall have to sell your furnishings and clothes, to pay part of the debt your father owes.
Ordinarily, you would go to a charitable institution, but I'm going to let you remain here.
There will be duties for you to perform, of course.
I hope you appreciate my kindness in not sending you away.
I was unable to fi nd a black dress among your things, but one of the girls has given you this.
You'd better take off that party frock and put this on.
I'll send up some shoes.
I don't believe it. I don't, I don't!
My daddy has to go away. But he'll return most any day.
Any moment I may see, my daddy coming back to me.
And Miss Minchin is going to sell all her things.
- It was beastly having to give back all our presents.
- How do you feel now about your little Princess?
- Oh Miss. Is there anything I can do?
- No Becky, but thank-you.
Sara, I'm sorry.
Sara, from now on, you are not to sit with us. Return to your room and smooth down those curls.
And then go to the kitchen. Run along now.
Lavina, you may take your old place, beside me.
- Mrs. O'Connel.
- Oh, so the Misses has sent you down to me, has she?
- Miss Minchin said that I am to have my breakfast here. - You'll do more than eat your breakfast if you work for that one.
- I should be glad to help.
- You will eh?
Look at you! Look what you're doing! For that you'll get no breakfast.
Min, you'd better make some more toast for the Misses. Right.
Here's your breakfast. Take it over there. We don't associate with royality.
- Let me wait on you Miss. No you don't.
- She can wait on herself. You can sit there and watch her eat.
Perhaps that will teach you a leson.
Please Mrs. O'Connel. May I give my breakfast to Becky? I'm not that hungry this morning.
Give it to the cat if you like. Then get to work and wash them dishes.
No Miss, I don't want it.
The mail just came.
The mail just came.
My darling girl. I have been half mad trying to find a way out of you since your letter reached me.
But it has come! My grandfather has relented.
I pray him, that this money and my love will help you bear what lies ahead. Geoffrey.
- You say this girl's a teacher at your school?
- She was, until I discharged her today.
We're not likely to hear from her again.
And I was prepared to turn over a handsome sum to that boy when he got back.
I even made an ass of myself and sent him a check.
Then I was right to withhold this.
He made it over to her.
- You're not very fond of the girl, are you?
- Hardly, under the circumstances.
- Are you sure the girl has no legitimate claims on him?
- I brought her up from a fondling.
Is it likely, she would not have consulted me if their love had been respectable.
Ram Dass!
Yes sir? In future if any letters or cables come from Mr. Geoffrey, they're to be returned, unopened.
As you wish sahib.
Come in Becky.
I'm glad you weren't asleep Miss.
It's one of the lonely nights.
I wonder where Miss Rose is?
I shall miss her terribly.
- We're all alone in the world now, aren't we Miss?
- No, no, we're not alone. There is my father you know.
-Your father? But cook said he......
- You mustn't say that. It isn't true.
He's not dead.
He sick or wounded somewhere, or he'd send for me. But he's not dead.
- How do you know Miss?
- Something inside tells me so.
And sometimes I hear him calling for me.
All alone Miss.
- Buford! You're smoking!
- As you see.
- Today my good woman, the British army is behind me.
- That uniform? You're not going to war.
Quite! To the very cannon's mouth, if need be. But why? Because old girl. I've had it to the teeth with your bulling.
And your treatment of Rose and little
Sara is the last straw. I prefer the less painful horrors of the battlefield.
- Are you daring to critize me?
- Astonishing, isn't it?
But it proves that I am competent to lead my men, into the very jaws of death.
- After this, you may never expect help from me again.
- I am quite calm.
For if the blood-thirsty boar spares me, the foot-knights will see
Bubbling Bertie once again.
-Buford, you wouldn't do that to me? Oh wouldn't I?
- Well, ta-ta old girl.
If you please sir? What is it lassie?
Were you at the seige of Mafeking?
- Aye, that's where I stopped the bullet that stopped me.
- Then did you know my father?
- Your father? What might his name be lassie?
- Captain I Crew.
-Was your father a Captain?
- Yes. They say he is dead, but I know it can't be.
- I've asked so many soldiers about him. I hope you can tell me.
- No lassie, I'm sorry, I can't.
-Why don't you ask in the hospital there?
- Maybe they'll have some record of him. Thank-you sir, I will!
- If you please sir.
- Well the little Princess as I live.
Why Mr. Bertie, I thought you'd gone to war
No, Lord Roberts wanted me to of course. But he said: "Bertie old boy, the wounded need you."
So you stay here and cheer up the brave lads who have fallen in our dust corps."
So I'm practically in command of this hospital.
- Oh Mr. Bertie. Can my father be in there?
- Your father Princess?
Yes, you see I know he isn't dead.
I've been looking and looking.
He could be among the wounded, couldn't he? Yes..... I'm almost sure he is, somewhere.
If you're in charge, could I please look for him in there? Well ah.....
Pleeeeeease.
Yes, yes of course you may. Things like that can happen you know.
- Mr. Bertie, why did you join the command here?
- Well disipline in the hospital is rather lax.
I say Major. They're waiting for you in ward B. There is a lot of trash up there.
- Very good. I'll get one of my men to attend to it.
- Get one of your what??
Well then 2 of my men, carry on!
Portor! Sir?
- What's this child doing here before visiting hours?
- Well you see... Well, well, well. If you please sir.
The Major is helping me find my father.
- The Major?
- For her sir. You see, we're old friends sir.
I knew her father, Captin Crew was reported killed at Mafeking.
The child is sure there is some mistake, so I'm helping her search among the wounded.
- Could you tell me anything about my father sir?
- Sorry my dear, I can't.
- Carry on, Major!
- Yes, sir. Thank-you sir.
This little girl's father has been killed, but she insists he's alive so
I'm letting her look around.
We'll try another ward.
- There's old Bertie.
- Give us a song mate.
Attention men! Attention! Official inspection.
He isn't here either. But someone might know about him.
- If you please sir. Were you at the seige of Mafeking? - I was that darling.
It's there I got bit by a bug.
It was no bigger than the seed of a thistle and it laid me low. Ah, the bugs down there are worse than the bullets.
- Perhaps you didn't know my father?
- Afraid I wouldn't have known me own father, with the fever that was on me.
- Thank-you sir.
- It's all right darling.
- If you please sir. Were you with the troops at Mafeking? -Yes, yes of course
I was. That's where I ran away.
- Then did you know my father,
Captain Crew?
- Yes, yes of course.
- That's a fine looking officer, isn't he?
He ought to do well. - Well when did you see my father last? Where is he now?
Where is who? My father. Oh, one soldier more or less, doesn't make any difference you know.
I'm making thousands and thousands for England. Fine strong fellows, who won't be afraid like I was.
I was afraid of the noise. That's why I ran away you know?
- He says he knows my father, but he won't tell.
- He's been living in a dream Sara, he doesn't know what he's saying.
Don't go yet lad. Give us a song!
- How about it dear? Shall we sing them a song to cheer them up?
- Our old speciality. Not today Mr. Bertie.
- Oh come on darling. Let's try and forget our own troubles and do something for these lads, shall we? - All right, I'll try.
- What about "The Old Kent Road"?
Yeah, that's the one. Mackie will play for you.
- I'd be delighted Mac.
- Mr. Bertie, will it be all right if I come again tomorrow? - I shouldn't run away too often
Princess. You might get punished you know.
- I'll keep a sharp look-out for whenever the wounded come in.
-You don't really believe he come, do you?
Yes, yes, of course I do. I told you missing men often turn up.
Then I'd better come. You might not know him, if he's very much changed.
- All right dear. You come.
- Good-bye Mr. Bertie. Good-bye dear.
Are you hungry.
Poor little things. There won't be any worms for you this morning.
Good-morning little misses sahib.
Good morning Ras Dass. Feeding your little friends?
-Yes, but I couldn't feed them very much from my supper last night.
- It is difficult for them when the snow comes.
Rani, Rani!
You look as though you are being naughty and enjoying it.
- Her she is, on the bookshelf.
- Bookshelf?
Oh I forgot. I pretend it's a bookshelf and fill them with beautiful books.
Well I'd better remove her, before she ruins your set of Dickens.
This is your room Misses sahib?
It's so old and so high above everything, it's almost like a nest in a tree.
I can lie on my soft sofa and look up into the sky through that little window on the roof.
- Sofa? - It looks more like a soft sofa when it's made up.
Can you imagine it has down quilts and lovely cushions to curl up on.
- There is a fire sometimes, of course?
- Well, that is the hardest sometimes, to imagine.
But it's lovely when you can. The grate shines so when it is polished and the bright coals on the hearth.
- Oh hurry Miss. Cook is in an awful dither.
- Oh my goodness. Excuse me if I run.
I've got to go to the butcher. I'll get my ears boxed if I don't hurry.
Listen to this: Hospital Ship Mercy arrived with 1 200 wounded disembarked.
-Does it give any of the names?
- There ain't no list.
Oh I hope my poor Harry's among them. A wounded husband is better than no husband at all, eh Min?
Oh Becky, I've got to get to the hospital before 9 o'clock when they close for visitors.
Sara! You clumsy ox! For that you'll whistle for your supper.
Oh Mame, Sara didn't get know lunch. You put things away before she got back from the grocer.
Who do you think you're talking to?
You'll both go hungry. Now clean up this mess. Go on, get on with it!
There some sorry cases in this batch, doctor.
Doctor, this man is an unknown.
His papers were lost. Delerium following maleria fever.
- We're very much concerned about him sir.
- Heart action, weak resperation, well that's to be expected.
- He has no lucid moments.
- Temporary paralyzes of some nerve center or a blood clot possibly.
More likely to be the latter sir.
He received a nasty headwound.
- He repeated the call of this person Sara.
- You can't know who this Sara is?
No way of finding out sir, until his identity is established.
- You'd better go now Miss.
- I'll finish up for you. Thank-you
Becky. I'll have to fly.
Here hold your horses. Where do you think you're going? Miss Lavina want's some coal for her fire. Hop to it.
Oh Sara! You look so tired and you look hungry too.
- Are you actually hungry Sara?
- Yes! I am hungry. I'm so hungry I could eat you!
Put on plenty, my father pays for it.
Put on plenty, my father pays for it.
Come back here and clean up that hearth!
I'd like my shawl. The pink one. It's on my bed.
Cover me please. I find the room a bit chilly.
-Hello Princess, what are you doing out so late?
- I've come to see the new soldiers that arrived today.
- Not tonight my girl. It's closing time.
- But I've got to. I ran away especially.
- Please let me in. I'm sure he's here this time.
- You're sure every time Princess.
I'm sorry. You run on home and come back tomorrow morning. That's a good little girl. All right, good-night now.
He'll recover from the effects of the fever, but I'm convinced there is brain pressure.
- You advise an operation then? Yes.
Do you agree. - I do and Dr. McNesh in Edinburgh is the man.
Prepare this man for removal to
Edinburgh tomorrow. Yes doctor.
Sara, where have you been?
- Answer me. You've been out, haven't you?
- Yes Miss Minchin.
- What do you mean by disobeying my orders?
- I had to, I had to look for my father.
All this ridiculous searching for your father. All this making believe and refusing to face facts, it's indecent.
- I've had enough of it. You must realize once and for all that your father is dead.
- Don't you say that. He's not dead. He's not!
- And you can't stop me from looking for him either. - How dare you speak to me in that manner you little......
I'll attend to you further in the morning.
I can't be a good soldier for much longer. I'm cold and I'm hungry too.
Do you hear? No, you don't hear and you don't care. You're nothing but a doll, a doll!
You've never had a heart to make you feel. You're just a doll.
Your Highness, please forgive me, but something has gone amiss.
There is an angry woman outside to report a stolen kiss.
Tell her she must go away. Come around some other day.
I have told her but she won't. You must see her, if you don't, she'll scream her head off.
- Tell her to hush. She won't be hushed.
- Then tell her to shush! I'm afraid she won't be shushed.
I won't be hushed, I won't be shushed, I know my rights and I know also what I saw.
- What did you see?
- I saw him.
You saw who? I mean whom?
I saw that lad steal a kiss, from that shameless little miss.
Don't be fooled by all their shyness, they're a wicked pair Your Highness.
The Law says in its shining, that you should not kiss in this land.
There's a law I understand, against kissing in this land.
There is a law that reads like this.
No one is to steal a kiss.
Ah but Princess, I've a feeling, this isn't a case of stealing.
Silence fool. I know the law. What
I say I saw, I saw.
She's on a see-saw. What I saw, you saw, he saw, she saw.
On a see-saw. On a see-saw. l saw, you saw, he saw, she saw.
What she tells us may be true. And if it is, what can we do?
If you ask me, we should listen, to the lad who did the kissing.
Let him speak. Come lad this way.
Now then, what have you to say?
Please Your Highness, I confess.
When I saw such lovliness...
...it was too much to resist. I just thought she should be kisssed.
So I kissed her, kissed her twice.
It was very, very nice.
So he kissed her, kissed her twice.
It was very, very nice.
There you see, he broke the law.
What I say I saw, I saw.
- Please don't start all that again.
- But he stole a kiss, that's plain.
Yes, it looks as if it's true and I'll have to punish you.
No please. Let me say a word. It is not the way you heard.
Please, he did not steal a kiss.
I gave it to him. Just like this.
There you see, I had a feeling, this was not a case of stealing.
I'm not sure, it's not quite plain, could I see that kiss again?
You were right, I have a feeling, this was not a case of stealing.
Right! The law has been abused.
This lad has falsely been accused.
He's hers and she's hisn's, that old witch should go to prison.
- You're a very wicked woman.
- Princess, I am only human.
Listen to the old grand-mommy.
You're a nasty peeping-tommy.
Banish her from here forever.
Never show your face here, never.
Banish her from here forever.
Never show your face here, never.
But what I say I saw, I saw. I know my rights, I know the law!
Come and sit beside me here. Your kiss has made things very clear.
Thank-you Princess.
Don't thank me. Was that kiss, that set you free.
Now we're through with this arrangement. Let us have some entertainment.
Bring the dancers, bring the singers, bring the good old welting ringers.
- The new ballerina? She please you?
- She's a very good dancer. She looks familiar too.
What a nice dream. I feel quite warm.
I don't want to wake up.
I haven't waked up.
I must be dreaming.
I am dreaming.
I must be dreaming. But it feels warm.
Becky, Becky come quick.
- Yes Miss?
- Look!
Oh no Miss. Do you see what I do?
- I don't know what you see.
- But I don't believe what I see.
Well, I never.....
- Can you feel that? Yes Miss.
- What do you see? I see some fire Miss.
And a table with food on it, and a rug and a lamp, and slippers?
I do indeed Miss. How did it all get here? Did you pretend it into happening?
I don't know. I never pretended as good as this before.
Look at these.
- If the little misses sahib knew, she'd be over here to thank you.
- Who wants any thanks?
- Oh Miss! You're beautiful!
- Thanks Becky. Now let's try this one on you.
- Isn't it beautiful? Oh yes Miss.
- It's perfect. And real satin too.
Let's try the slippers and see if they're real.
- Do they feel like slippers to you?
- They feel soft and warm.
This feels soft and warm too.
They're as real as we are.
I don't believe it's a dream after all.
- Do you suppose the food is real Miss?
- Let us see.
- I can smell kippers, can you?
- Kippers and onions.
I wonder what this is? Muffins!
This tastes like a muffin. Is it one?
A muffin that ever was. It must be the magic Miss.
Hadn't we better be quick before it melts away?
- What sort of night did he have?
- He rested comfortably doctor.
- Will we be able to send him with the others?
- Will we be able to send him with the others?
Get him ready to be sent with group
D. He'll be leaving in about an hour.
I hear you're being punished. Do you think we ought to offer her a chocolate?
- You must let her smell them.
- Miss Minchin surely couldn't object to that.
- Would you care to?
- I don't want to smell them, and I don't want to eat them.
- You don't!? Why not?
- I've had much nicer things than chocolate this morning.
- Listen to the Princess, pretending again.
-I'm not pretending.
I had the most wonderful things to eat, that anyone had.
- Why you little liar. You haven't even had breakfast.
- Pardon me, but I really have.
Excuse me for saying so, it isn't polite to call people liars.
- How dare you talk back to me.
-Was I doing that? My goodness.
So sorry.
You wait til I tell Miss Minchin on you!
Well, everything is still here Becky.
- Thank heavens it's stopped raining.
- Are you going some place Miss?
To the hospital. Becky, perhaps everything is going to change for us.
Perhaps I'll find my father this time and he'll take us away from here.
Oh no! It's the Misses.
Sara, how dare you......
- Why, what's happened to this room?
-That's what we would like to know.
When I woke up this morning, here everything was. Even to the food and the fire.
- Where did you get these things? - I don't know. Maybe because I dreamed such a beautiful dream last night, that it came true.
These articles are rare and costly.
You stole them, didn't you?
- Oh no Miss Minchin. We didn't take these things. - I'll give you one more chance to tell me the truth.
- But I am telling you the truth.
- They just came. Yes, they did indeed Mame.
You go to your room. This is a matter for the police.
- Oh please Miss Minchin. Please don't call the police.
- Of course I'll call them.
- Oh we're prisoners sure enough
Miss, and the police coming too.
- I can't be arrested.
- Those new wounded men are at the hospital and I got to get to them.
- I don't see how you can Miss.
Come on Becky, quick. Where are we going Miss? Follow me.
- Oh I'm so frightened Miss. I'm frightened this time too.
- Come on Becky, give me your hand.
- Oh low Miss.
- Don't be afraid Becky.
- Ah, what game is this little Misses sihib?
- Can we please go through your house? We're running away from the police.
- And a very nice game to. Would you enter?
-We would like to, very much indeed.
- You seem in great haste Miss sihib. Will you not stop for a cup of tea?
- Oh no thank you. We're in too big of a hurry.
Oh, I see. You are still playing the game of the police.
- I hope you escape in safety Miss sihib.
- So do I. Oh low Miss, police!!
- There they are! Stop them!
-Becky, run, run!
Sara, Becky! Stop where you are!
Go after the other one. I'll take care of her.
Watch out Becky, don't slip. Becky, where are you?
- Wretched little beast. You'll go to jail, both of you!
- You'll never catch Sara. Mr. Bertie will see to that.
So that's where she's gone. Well did you find them Mame? Take this little thief and don't let her out of your sight till I return.
- Did you catch her? She dodged her way into traffic. - I couldn't find her anywhere.
Do you know where she's likely to be?
I do. Cabbie!
Harvard Hospital and hurry please.
He never stops calling for her.
Step aside a little bit will you? Ah, ah, ah. You can't go in there.
- No visitors allowed for an hour.
- But that might be too late.
Now run along little girl, will you?
- I'm sorry sir. No visitors allowed for an hour.
- But we must go in.
Sorry sir. You can stand over there, if that's all right.
- Have you seen Captain Marks?
- I believe he just went through the hall Miss.
- Sorry young one, but you can't go upstairs now.
- But I've got to. I've got to see if my father is here before Miss Minchin catches me.
Run along now. Do as you are told.
I say there. You come back here.
You can't go up there.
You can't go in there.
Let me go, let me go. I want to be here. I will! I will!
Porter!!
What is it the child wants?
- Please, please don't let them take me away.
- What is it child?
My father. They say he was killed at Mafeking, but I don't believe it.
He may be with the new wounded men, but they won't let me look.
If they don't, perhaps I'll never have another chance. Can't you make them let me look.
Colonel. Could you see that this child is escorted through the hospital?
With permission, I shall accompany her personally Your Majesty.
- What is your name?
- Victoria. What is yours?
Sara.......Oh Your Majesty!
Colonel.
I hope that you will fi nd your father my dear. A thorough search Colonel.
- Oh thank-you Your Majesty.
- Good-bye my dear.
- Have you been through any of the wards yet?
- Not today sir.
I think we'd better cover this wing first.
We are searching for a patient.
Move right along dear.
- Is it all right?
- Thank-you darling.
- Miss Rose!
- Sara darling!
Oh Mr. Geoffrey. You're home, you're back again. You can tell me where my daddy is.
Well Geoffrey didn't get as far as
Mafeking dear.
Then you don't know? You didn't even see him?
No dear, I didn't. I'm sorry.
- Have you found him?
- Oh, no sir.
This is my friend Mr. Geoffrey and his wife. Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton.
- Mrs. Hamilton. - I'm afraid I can't introduce you, because I don't know your name. - I'm Colonel Gordon.
- This is Colonel Gordan. He's helping me search the hospital.
- Oh, don't bother. How do you do sir?
I'm very happy to know you both.
From Mafeking?
- No sir. An army mule, a British mule at that.
- That's adding insult to injury.
-Sorry sir, but it's time for the patient's drops.
- Well, I'd rather face that mule.
I'll come back later Miss Rose. Just as soon as I've gone through the other wards.
- I'll wait for you dear.
- Good-bye.
- Be sure to come back Sara.
- I will.
Poor little thing. She'll never stop hoping.
- I insist that you send for my brother.
-Very well Mame, but you can't get in. Brother or no brother.
- We will get in. My brother will see to that.
- I hope you're right Mame.
All filled now. This man will have to wait until the next ambulance.
I think you'd better take him into the waiting room. These halls are much too drafty.
- I very sorry that you couldn't find your father.
- Thank-you just the same sir.
He may be on the next convoy of wounded. I wouldn't give up hope.
I won't sir.
- Good-bye and God bless.
- Good-bye.
I know that they were stolen. That is perposterous! I can prove it and I intend to turn her over to the authorities.
She is in this hospital and I intend to find her. I insist that every room be searched.
Sara...
Sara...
Daddy...
Daddy, daddy! It is you! I found you, I found you!
They said you were dead, but I knew you weren't. I knew you'd come back.
Oh daddy, hold me, hold me close.
You won't ever go away again, will you?
What's the matter daddy? Why won't you talk to me?
Don't you know me daddy? I'm
Sara, I'm Sara.
- Where is my daughter?
- Oh daddy, something's happened to you.
Mr. Bertie! Mr. Bertie! Oh daddy, you've got to know me.
Look at me!
You mustn't cry. You mustn't cry.
- We must be good soldiers you know.
- But I have been a good soldier daddy, but you don't know me.
- My little Sara never cries.
- But I'm Sara, I'm Sara!
Yes, yes,...Sara! Sara!
Sara, my darling. My baby Sara.
Sara my darling. My little Sara.
- Oh don't be ridiculous Amanada. - Well then how do you account for those silk covers, those robes and those other things that are there.
Perhaps a little bird brought them in. Perhaps they grew legs and walked in. I don't know.
One thing I do know is little Sara wouldn't steal them.
Bertie! Yes? Berties, what do you think has happened? Little Princess has found her father.
She's found him!
- Captain Crew is alive?
- Of course he's alive! How could she find him if he wasn't alive?
- Oh Mr. Bertie, I found my father.
- Darling, I'm so glad.
Daddy, it's Your Majesty.
My daddy.
A whale! A whale!
Now you all keep quiet, and I'll tell you about the time
Uncle Mickey was shipwrecked.
'Twas a dark and stormy night.
The lightning flashed.
The thunder rolled.
The wind whistled.
And the wind howled.
It was a terrible storm.
And then a big wave picked me up and rolled me up on the beach.
I was in a strange land.
Boy, was I tired.
I slept all night, under a blanket of beautiful stars.
And then day broke.
Fire!
LITTLE LORD FAUNTLEROY
Brooklyn, New York... in the 1880's.
I never saw a man meet death with finer courage.
Don't let her stay in there too long.
Dearest, is Father... is Father well now?
Yes, dear, he's well, he's quite well, but we have no one left now but each other.
No one at all.
My baby!
Ceddie was not old enough to 
know of anything else to do,
so he did what he could
and was more of a comfort to 
her than he understood.
Strawberries! Fresh strawberries!
Strawberries!
Fresh strawberries!
He'll be pleased, won't he?
Ach, the darlin'! To think of him getting the like of that for his birthday.
Sure he'll be the happiest boy in all
Brooklyn till he falls off of it!
Dearest!
Dearest!
- All right, Ceddie.
Oh, Dearest... Look! Look!
Mary's brother, Michael, has made it for me and Mary's given me this book.
It's "The Adventures of Robin Hood and His Merry Men".
Listen,
Back varlets! Touch Maid Marian at your
peril. However many you be, I defy you all!
See, Dearest, you're Maid Marian, and I'm Robin Hood.
They crowd around you. I'll never leave your side however many there are!
Oh! - Now, Dearest, you cry out:
"Help me, Robin Hood!"
Help me, Robin Hood! Help! Help!
Down with you, varlets! Now I'm...
- Oh!
There!
Do you like it?
Oh my!
Of all events in my life this is the most magnificent!
Do you really like it, darling? It's what you wanted? - It's exactly what I wanted!
I do hope it is! Only you will be careful, won't you and not let it run away with you?
I suppose I'm about the safest bicycle rider in the whole Brooklyn!
Ha-ha - d'ya mind that now!
Can I ride it now, Dearest? 
Can I go now? - Go!
I can't wait one minute.
Mr. Hobbs has to see it and Dick.
Can I go now, Dearest, at once?
- Yes, dear, only do be careful.
All right, there we are!
Bring it down slow.
Ceddie! Ceddie!
Do be careful of the streetcars if you get out the sidewalk.
Oh, I will! - Now, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Good-bye, Dearest!
Good-bye!
Ah-ha! Be careful.
I'll be careful, I'll be careful,
I'll be careful.
I'll be careful.
Good morning, Mrs. McGillycuddy.
- Good morning, Ceddie, a very good morning.
How are your bones today, Mrs. McGillycuddy?
Oh, none too good after the rainstorm yesterday.
Oh, they ached last night somethin' cruel.
Ties me up in knots the rain does.
- Does it? How very peculiar.
But, ah, it's a fine day to go bicycle riding.
Oh, I suppose so, for them that has bicycles and can ride them.
I suppose everybody who has a new bicycle will take it out and ride it today.
Glory be the goodness! And whose bicycle might that be? - It's mine!
It's my birthday present from Dearest.
- Oh, it's a daisy, shure.
Fine enough for the president to ride.
- And it has all the latest improvements.
Oh! Sorta sounds like the bells of St. Patrick!
Shure it's the luckiest boy in the world ya are.
Well I'll have to be going.
I nearly forgot. Please choose my apple now, Mrs. McGillicuddy.
But would you mind keeping it for me until I get back? -Sure.
Oh, there he goes oh, there he goes
All dressed up in his purty clothes
The way ain' near away'n it be
That's as tough as it's going to be
Hey, where'd ya get de ice wagon?
- I'd like to get by, please.
Give us a little ride, will ya, bub?
- I'm sorry, no.
Aw, scared I'd get it dirty?
- No, but I'd rather ride it myself.
[indistinct protesting]
Hey, English, when did ya get back from dear old London? - I'm not English.
I'm American.
- Then where'd ya get that kinda gab?
My Father was English.
- Oh, does yer mudder know you're out?
Don't you dare talk about my mother!
- Mama's pet!
Mama's pet! Mama's pet! Ha, ha, ha.
I think you'd better take your hand off that wheel. - Want to make anything out of it?
I want to make you get out of the way.
Ooh, ha... ha.
You don't dast, you sissy cat.?- Sissy cat! Sissy cat!
Ha, ha... ha.
Wait a minute, Ceddie!
Don't let them bluff you! I'll be right there.
Ha, ha... ha.
Ha, ha, ha! Ha, ha, ha!
Let go!
Go on, Dick! Strike him on the snoot!
Booo!
Hit him with the right!
Poke him in the kisser!
Heh, cheese it - a cop!
Here, ye young devils!
Git outta here! Git out! Git out!
Aw, why couldn't that copper leave us alone? - We had 'em licked!
Thanks terribly for coming to my rescue, Dick.
That makes us even for me givin' ya de mumps, hunh?
They didn't even scratch it.
Gee whillikers! Where'd you swipe that?
Dearest gave it to me. Isn't it magnificent? - It's a lalapalooza!
I want you to be the very first person to ride on it. - Aw, t'anks.
Ahem!
Aw!
Thank you very much for your assistance, Mr.
O'Brien. - It's a pleasure, Ceddie, me lad.
Course, I think we might have won anyway.
Sure, and don't I know it! But I had to keep ya from committin' murder.
I tell you what, Dick. I'll just go once around the block and then you can ride it to Mr. Hobbs store.
Make it later, 'cause I gotta see me brudder Ben off. He's goin' out West.
Oh, is he? Where? Texas?
- No, Chicago.
Oh, that would be splendid!
Riding mustangs and shooting bears!
Dere's me brudder Ben now.
Come on, Dick. I've got to leave.
Well, come on down to Mr. Hobbs' store as quickly as you can.
HOBBS' FANCY VEGETABLES & GROCERIES
What do you say to a little birthday party?
Ginger pop and cookies, and some candy?
That would be perfect Mr. Hobbs! Only...
- Only?
Well, oh, Dick's coming very soon and
I was thinking, oh, if we could wait.
I guess there'll be enough to go around.
There's a lump coming, 
I think, quite a big one!
What are you reading, Mr. Hobbs?
Ah! That's the way they go on now.
British aristocracy!
I've got no use for 'em - earls and marquises goin' around as if they was lords of creation, wearin' their coronets.
Did you ever know any marquises, Mr. Hobbs, or earls? - No, I should say not.
I'd just like to catch one of 'em inside here, that's all!
I'll have no graspin' tyrant sittin' around on my cracker barrels!
Perhaps they wouldn't be earls if they knew any better.
Oh, wouldn't they though!
They just glory in it! It's in 'em.
They're a bad lot.
Here you are, Dick. Just in time for Ceddie's birthday feast.
Jimminity... ginger pop and everything!
Here's to your health, Ceddie.
Many happy birthdays!
Thank you very much, Mr. Hobbs.
Why, Mary?
Come on home, darlin'.
The mistress is wanting ya.
Oh, glory be! Would you look at your face!
I'm very sorry, Mr. Hobbs, but I shan't be able to stay for the feast.
Is anything wrong with the Dearest?
- Not at all. Sure, there's nothin' the matter.
What's happened, Mary?
- Now, don't be askin' me any questions.
But there's the queer, strange things happenin' to us.
If you'll forgive me, Mrs. Errol, you must not disregard the great position to which your son has fallen heir through the death of his uncle, your late husband's brother.
But what it amounts to, Mr. Havisham, is that you want to take my boy away.
Mrs. Errol, you must remember that I'm acting quite impersonally and simply as the lawyer of the earl of Dorincourt.
The earl of Dorincourt disowned his son and has refused to recognize his grandson until now.
Why should I give up my boy?
I'm afraid I've been very stupid, 
Mrs. Errol. I should have told you.
My instructions are that you shall accompany
Lord Fauntleroy to England. - Oh!
However, I must remind you that Lord
Dorincourt is not very friendly towards you.
He's an old man and has always had very strong prejudices against America and Americans and was bitterly opposed to his son's marriage.
He's fixed in his determination not to see you.
You will live at the lodge and a suitable income will be provided for you.
The only stipulation is that you make no attempt to visit your son in the castle, nor even enter the Park Gates.
There's your sister, Mary.
Hello, Bridget. Why, what's the matter?
It's Michael! He's worse and we've no money we can't pay the rent.
I don't know what... - Now, Bridget, I've more important things to attend to!
I wonder what your husband's wishes would have been in this matter?
You knew my husband?
Yes, I knew Captain Errol well and liked him, as everybody did.
He was greatly attached to his old home.
- Yes, I know.
He, above everyone, would have appreciated what this means to your son the very great advantages he'll have.
Yes, you're right.
My husband would have wished it.
Mr. Havisham, I must ask you to let me tell Ceddie about this in my own way and in my very own time. He must never know his grandfather dislikes me.
If he did, it would make it harder for them to be friends.
Very well. Your son will thank you for this when he is a man.
I hope his grandfather will love Ceddie.
He has a very affectionate nature and he's always been loved.
This is Mr. Havisham, dear, whom your grandfather sent to see us, all the way from England.
How do you do, sir?
- So this is little Lord Fauntleroy.
You see, dear, your grandfather has no more children now, and he's very lonely.
So he wants us to go and live with him in England.
Because he's an earl and you're his heir, you will have a new name - Lord Fauntleroy.
And someday you will be the earl of Dorincourt.
Oh, Dearest, do I have to be an earl?
None of the boys are earls.
Can't I not be one? - I'm afraid it can't be helped, dear.
Just think, dear, soon we'll be starting for England.
Do we have to go to England, Dearest?
I'd much rather not.
Oh! What will Mr. Hobbs say?
Anything else ma'am?
- How much is your table butter?
13 cents a pound.
- 13! The last I bought was 12,5 cents.
Must've been last month. It's 13 today.
- Oh, indeed. Well, never mind the butter.
Heavens and earth, if the prices go any higher, we'll all starve to death!
Good day!
- Good day, ma'am.
Hello, Ceddie. What's the matter?
Mr. Hobbs, do you remember what we were talking about yesterday morning?
It seems to me we was talkin' about England.
Yes, yes and earls. Don't you remember?
Oh, yes, we did touch 'em up a little.
That's so.
You said you wouldn't have them sitting around your cracker barrels.
So I did and I meant it too!
Just let them try it, that's all!
Mr. Hobbs, one is sitting on this barrel now.
What?
- Yes.
I'm one or I'm going to be.
I won't deceive you, Mr. Hobbs.
It's the heat!
It is a hot day.
How do ya feel? Got any pain?
Thank you, I'm all right.
I'm sorry to say it's true, Mr. Hobbs.
Mr. Havisham, he's a lawyer, came all the way from England to tell us about it.
My grandfather sent him.
Who is your grandfather?
I couldn't very easily remember it, so I wrote it down.
John Arthur Molyneux Errol, earl of Dorincourt.
That's his name, and he lives in a castle
'er two or three castles, I think.
All his sons have died now. That's why I shall be an earl. Now I'm Lord Fauntleroy.
Well, I'll be jiggered.
One of us has got a sunstroke.
Oh, no, we haven't. We'll have to make the best of it, Mr. Hobbs.
What did you say your name was?
- Cedric Errol Lord Fauntleroy.
Well, I am jiggered.
Well... you always did talk more English than American.
You think there's no getting out of it?
I'm afraid not, Mr. Hobbs.
Dearest says that Father would wish me to do it but if I have to be an earl,
I can try to be a good one.
I'm not going to be a tyrant, Mr. Hobbs and if there's ever to be another war with America, I shall try and stop it.
England's a long way off, isn't it?
It's across the Atlantic Ocean.
That's the worst of it. Perhaps 
I shan't see you for a long time.
I don't like to think about that, Mr. Hobbs.
Well... the best of friends must part.
I'm afraid, Mr. Havisham, our American food must seem very strange for you.
A little, ma'am. I find that muffins are biscuits, and biscuits are cookies but the cooking's excellent.
And after all, it's the company that makes the meal exquisite, not the food.
Thank you, Mr. Havisham.
When you're an earl, you'll give splendid dinners in one of the most beautiful castles in England.
Do you know, I'm not sure I know exactly what an earl is?
If anybody's going to be one, he ought to know, don't you?
Would you mind explaining it to me?
Well, someone is made an earl generally because he's done some service to his sovereign or some great deed.
- Oh, that's like the president!
Oh, is it? Is that why your presidents are elected?
Yes, sir, When a man's very good and knows a great deal, he's elected president.
And they have torchlight processions, and bands, and everybody makes speeches.
I used to think I might like to be president but never thought of being an earl.
No, being an earl is rather different from being a president.
An earl is generally of very ancient lineage.
Uh, what's that?
A very old family - extremely old.
Oh, that's like the apple woman.
She's a hundred, I should think.
She's of such ancient lineage, it'd surprise you how she can stand up.
You feel sorry for anyone who's so poor and has such ancient lineage.
She says hers has gone into her bones and rain makes it worse. - Ha, ha, ha.
When I said ancient lineage,
I didn't mean old age.
The first earl of Dorincourt was created an earl hundreds of years ago.
Well, that was a long time ago, wasn't it Dearest? - Yes, dear.
Many earls have been very brave men and have fought in great battles.
I should like to do it myself.
My father was a soldier and a very brave man as brave as George Washington.
I'm glad earls are brave.
That's a great 'vantage.
Would you excuse me a moment, please?
There's someone I must see. - Oh, certainly.
There's, um, there's another advantage of being an earl.
Some of them have a great deal of money.
That's a good thing to have. I wish I had a great deal of money. - Do you? Why?
There's so many things a person can do with money.
If I were rich, I'd buy the apple woman a tent to put her stall in and a stove. I'd give her a shawl, because then her bones wouldn't feel so badly.
What else would you do if you were rich?
I'd buy Dearest all sorts of beautiful things. - Dearest?
I call Mother, "Dearest" because Father did.
Then there's Dick.
- And who's Dick? - Dick's a bootblack.
I'd buy him some new cloths, some brushes and a new sign - and start him out fair.
He says that's all he wants is to start out fair. - Hmm. Is there anything else?
Well, I think Mr. Hobbs would like a gold watch and chain.
But what would you get just for yourself, if you were rich?
Isn't there one particular thing you've dreaming of having? - Yes.
A pony... but I suppose that would be too much to even dream about.
I'm so sorry.
A poor woman in trouble came to see me.
Oh, is it Bridget?
- Yes, dear.
I wish we could do something for her.
She has six children and her husband is out of work.
He has inflammatory rheumatism and that's the kind of rheumatism that's dreadful.
Before I left Dorincourt castle, the earl said that if you expressed any wishes,
I was to gratify them and give you anything you desired.
Now, here... here are five pounds - in your money, 25 dollars.
If you have any desire to assist this poor woman,
I am sure your grandfather would wish it.
- Can I have it now?
Can I give it to her this minute?
May I be excused, please, Dearest?
- Yes, Ceddie. - Bridget!
Bridget, wait a minute!
Here's some money!
My grandfather gave it to me!
It's for you!
That's a great deal of money, Mr.
Havisham. We've never had very much.
I'm just beginning to realize the great power Ceddie will have.
Such a child still...
I'm a little afraid.
I think whom what I've seen of him that you have nothing to fear.
Oh, I hope not. He mustn't be spoilt by all these wonderful changes.
She cried!
She said she was crying for joy.
I newer saw anyone cry for joy before.
My grandfather must be a very good man.
It's more... more agreeable being an earl than I thought it was going to be.
In fact I'm almost quite glad
I'm going to be one!
Heh.
MRS. CEDRIC ERROL COURT LODGE
ERLESBORO ENGLAND
We always liked that little house, didn't we, Dearest? - We always will like it.
Yes, darling, yes.
I've come to say good-bye.
I have to go to England to be a lord.
I shouldn't like your bones in my mind every time it rains. - Oh, ho!
Bless your dear little heart with all kindness to me, me bones is as quiet as anything.
Can I give you a kiss for luck?
- Of course.
Here's an apple to eat on the boat.
- Thank you very much.
Oh, no, darlin'... Why should you pay?
As me late husband used to say,
"This one's on the house."
Thank you again. Well, good-bye.
- Good-bye, darlin'.
Well...
Well...
Well...
Well...
Well, good-bye.
I hope trade will be good.
Chee, if trade gets any better, I'll be rollin' around in di'monds and poils!
That would be splendid, wouldn't it!
I hope you have every sort of luck and happiness.
Thanks - same to you!
An' I hope you t'ink about us sometime when you're way over dere, as dey say, "on foreign surl".
I'll think about you all the time. I'll write to you. And you must write to me.
Here's where you send your letter.
Chee, I...
I wish you wasn't goin' away.
T'anks, mister, for the t'ings you're done for him.
He certainly deserves 'em.
He's a game little kid.
Chee, I almost forgot!
Here, I bought dis for ya.
It's a hankercheef. You can use it when you get among dem swells.
Oh, Dick! It's beautiful!
It's extraordinary!
I'll use it always.
Thank you, Dick.
Thank you very much.
Well... good-bye.
Well... good-bye.
Would you mind very much not going in with me?
I think I'd better be alone.
- Certainly. I quite understand.
This is for you, Mr. Hobbs.
It'll look fine when you're smoking it.
Why, Ceddie...
That's just what I wanted for a long time.
This is my real present, Mr. Hobbs.
There's something written on it - inside the case.
I told the man what to say. You read it.
From his oldest friend,
Lord Fauntleroy, to Mr. Hobbs.
When this you see, remember me.
When this you see, remember me.
I don't want you to forget me.
- Oh, I won't forget you.
Don't you go and forget me when you go over there amongst those British aristocracy.
I shouldn't forget you whoever I was among. I hope you'll come to see me.
Perhaps my grandfather will write and invite you.
You - you wouldn't mind him being an earl, would you?
I mean, uh... you wouldn't stay away just because he was one?
Oh, I'll come and see you.
I... I won't be able to help myself.
Cleared!
Cleared!
Is this Dorincourt Castle, Dearest?
- No. This is Court Lodge where your...
There's Mary! We had a splendid time in London, Mary.
I'm so glad you came before us, Mary.
We don't feel so strange, finding you here to welcome us.
Sure 'tis the great happiness I wish you ma'am, in your lovely, new home.
This is Mrs. Baines, the cook, ma'am, and that's Susan, the parlor maid.
I'm sure we'll do everything, ma'am, to make ye comfortable.
Oh, I'm sure you will.
I must say good-bye. The carriage is waiting to take me to the castle.
I must tell the earl of your safe arrival.
- He needn't go tonight?
I'd so like to have him with me my first night here.
No, I'm sure Lord Dorincourt won't expect his grandson tonight.
Tomorrow will be time enough.
I dread so to tell him that we're not going to live together anymore.
I'm a coward, I know, putting it off so long, but it's the most difficult, the most cruel thing I've ever had to do.
I wish you'd tell His Lordship that
I'd rather not have the money.
You mean the income he wishes to settle on you?
I have little money of my own quite enough to live simply on.
I must accept the house, because that makes it possible for me to be near Ceddie.
I'm grateful to him for that, but...
He'll be very angry.
He won't understand it at all.
I think he will understand.
He must understand that I can't accept money from a man who... hates me so much that he's separating me from my boy. - I'll deliver your message.
I think it's beautiful here, don't you Dearest?
Ceddie, darlin', there's something
I must tell you.
You're not going to understand it, I know, but I want you to believe me as you always have when I tell you it's for the best.
Tomorrow, Mr. Havisham will take you to your grandfather and you will live with him at the castle. I shall not go with you.
This pretty house will be my home, and
Mary will be here to look after me.
But Dearest you don't mean you can't mean that we're not going to be together just as we've always been?
Oh, no! I can't! I couldn't!
I won't! I won't!
Ceddie, you must be brave and sensible.
If there are some things you can't understand now, you'll understand them later.
It’s best for you to live there. There... there are good reasons why it tis.
You mean, you want me to go away from you?
- Of course not, darling.
But now you're growing older and we must trust and help one another, without asking any questions.
And you know, Ceddie, your grandfather loves you and wants you to love him.
He's so kind he... he wants you to be happy and to make other people happy.
But Dearest, I can't be happy without you.
But you won't be without me all the time.
I'm not far from the castle here and you'll run in and see me every day.
You'll love the castle and there'll always be something new and interesting to tell me.
And I'll have things to tell you! Oh,
Ceddie, we'll have such good times together!
We'll be finding things out, both of us. We'll be explorers.
Yes. Like... like Mr. Stanley and Mr. Livingston.
That'll be exciting.
And every night when it grows dark,
I'll put a candle in the window to guide you through the jungle, Mr. Stanley.
Ah, Newick. How's His Lordship?
- He's in the rare mood!
He told me to evict all the tenants if they weren't paid up.
I dare say, that'll be a job to your liking.
Oh, sir.
- Ah, Purvis, glad to see you again.
Very glad to see you, sir.
Fool! Idiot! Do what you're told, bring what's ordered!
Gout?
- Oh, yes, sir.
These last few weeks have been the worst I've ever known, sir.
I'm surrounded by a lot of incompetent nincompoops! Shut the door, you blockhead!
I can't stand 'im no longer, Mr. Purvis.
He's too much for any man - cursin', swearin' and callin' people out of other names like 'e does.
It ain't just today, it's every day!
Thomas, you brought him the '63 port.
He prefers the '51.
'Ow was I to know? He didn't say!
- Fetch the other bottle!
W'at business has 'e got drinking' 
Port anyway in 'is condition!
I can't feed and house every lout in the parish and I won't!
You and your poor - I've had enough of 'em! - But, my lord...
Mr. Mordaunt is with him.
I've said all I have to say, now, good night! - Good day, my lord... good day.
I beg your pardon.
How'd you do, Mr. Havisham?
Yes, ah, Mr. Mordaunt.
Mr. Havisham, my lord.
Well, Havisham. - My lord.
- Come back, have you?
Put that cushion right for me, will you?
Aie! Aie! Careful!
That foot's full of hot needles!
Well, what have you got to tell me?
Lord Fauntleroy and his mother are at Court Lodge.
They bore the voyage excellently, and in good health.
Ah... what else? - His Lordship remains with his mother tonight.
I'll bring him to the castle tomorrow.
- Well, go on! Tell me everything!
Never mind about the mother.
What sort of a lad is he, I say?
It's rather difficult to judge the character of a child of nine.
A fool, huh? A clumsy cub?
I don't know much about the children, but I thought him rather a fine lad.
Healthy, well grown, eh?
Apparently healthy, quite well grown.
- Straight limbed? Well enough to look at?
Rather handsome, my lord - as boys go.
- Ah.
Although I'm... I'm scarcely a judge.
I dare say you will find him a little different from most English children.
No doubt of that! American children are the most impudent and the worst brought up in the world.
I've heard that often enough.
- I would hardly call it impudent.
The difference is, that he has lived more with older people than with children and I should call it a mixture of maturity and childishness. - Exactly!
Beastly impudent bad manners - that what it tis!
I have a message to deliver from Mrs. Errol.
I want none of her messages!
The less I hear, the better!
Ah, but this is rather an important one.
She prefers not to accept the income you propose to settle on her.
What's that? What d'you say?
She says it's not necessary that as the relations between you are not... not friendly...
- Not friendly!
I should say they were not friendly!
Mercenary, sharp-voiced American!
My lord, you could hardly call her mercenary. She's asked for nothing!
Nah... all done for effect! She thinks she can wheedle me into seeing her.
Thinks I shall admire her spirit but
I don't! Have the money sent to her.
She won't spend it. - I don't care whether she spends it! She shall have it sent to her.
She shan't tell people she's to live as a pauper because I'm doing nothing for her!
I suppose she's poisoning the boy's mind against me too.
No, I have another message that will prove she's not done that.
I won't hear... Ow! Oh! Ah!
She asks you not to let Lord Fauntleroy hear anything that might lead him to understand that you are separating him from her because of your prejudice against her.
She says he wouldn't comprehend it.
That it might make him fear you in some measure, or at least, cause him to feel less affection for you.
She wants there to be no shadow on your first meeting.
Come now, Havisham, come now!
You don't mean that mother hasn't told him?
Not a word, my lord. Nothing has been said to the boy to give him the slightest doubt of your perfection.
He's prepared to believe you the most amiable and affectionate of grandparents.
In fact, he already regards you as a wonder of generosity.
Uh!
He does, eh?
I would suggest, my lord, that Fauntleroy's impressions of you depend entirely upon yourself.
I make a further suggestion you will succeed better with him if you take care not to speak slightingly to him of his mother.
- The boy's only nine.
Nevertheless, those nine years have been spent at his mother's side.
She has all his affection.
Hmm...
So he thinks me generous, eh!
Ah, Purvis, this is Lord Fauntleroy.
My lord. - How do you do?
- Thank you, my lord.
My lord.
This is Lord Fauntleroy, Mrs. Mellon.
Lord Fauntleroy, this is Mrs. Mellon, the housekeeper. - How do you do, ma'am?
I should know His Lordship anywhere, sir.
He has the Captain's face and way.
Oh, was it you who sent the cat?
I'm ever so obliged to you, ma'am.
How do you do?
It is a great day this, sir?
Where is His Lordship?
- In the library, sir.
Lord Fauntleroy is to be sent to him alone.
Lord Fauntleroy, my lord.
Dougal! Come back here!
How do you do, sir?
Are you the earl? I'm your grandson that
Mr. Havisham brought. I'm Lord Fauntleroy.
I hope you are quite well.
I'm very glad to see you.
- Hunh!
You're glad to see me, are ya?
- Yes, very.
I kept wondering what you would look like if you'd be like my father.
Oh, and am I? - Well, I don't think you are, very. - You're disappointed, I suppose.
Oh, no! Of course you would enjoy the way your grandfather looked, even if he wasn't like your father.
You know how it is yourself, about admiring your relations.
- Eh? I'm not sure that I do.
Any boy would love his grandfather, especially one who's been as kind to him as you've been.
- I've been kind to you, have I?
Yes. I'm ever so obliged to you about
Bridget, and the apple woman, and Dick.
Bridget? Dick? Apple woman?
- They were particular friends of mine.
The ones you gave me all that money for, the money you told Mr. Havisham to give me if I wanted it.
The money you were to spend as you liked, eh?
So, you spend it all on these people, did ya?
Bridget, Dick, and the apple woman?
Yes, and I gave Mr. Hobbs a gold watch and chain, and a pipe.
I put some poetry in the watch.
It was: "When this you see, remember me."
I'm going to miss Mr. Hobbs very much.
- Who is Mr. Hobbs?
He was our grocer - fancy vegetables and groceries, you know. He's my closest friend.
Mr. Hobbs is a very clever man.
Do you know, he can recite the Declaration of Independence right through.
Oh!
- What's the matter?
I just remembered you might not like to hear about the Declaration of Independence.
I forgot you were an Englishman.
- Hunh! You forgot!
You were English too, didn't ye?
- Oh, no! I'm an American!
You are English! Your father was an Englishman. - I was born in America.
You have to be an American if you are born in America.
You don't... - I beg your pardon for contradicting you.
Mr. Hobbs says if there's ever to be another war, that I should have to be an American.
I promised him if there were another war, I should try to stop it.
You would, would you? Ha, ha.
Dinner is served, my lord.
Ugh!
Now, be careful, man... be careful!
Careful now, careful.
Ow!
Would you like me to help you?
You can lean on me.
Once Mr. Hobbs hurt his foot with a potato barrel falling on it.
He used to lean on me.
- Do you think you could do it?
I think I could. I'm very strong.
I'm nine, you know.
Lean on your stick on one side and on me on the other. - Well... you may try it.
Just lean on me. I'll walk very slowly.
Don't be afraid of leaning on me.
I'm all right.
If it isn't a very long way.
D'you see that old fellow in red velvet?
He was the tenth earl of Dorincourt.
King George I decorated him for services during the war with Spain and Austria.
He was tremendously strong, could bend a bar of iron between his hands.
You get your strength from him.
- How... how very int'resting.
Did you ever try putting your foot in hot water and mustard? Mr. Hobbs used to.
Arnica is a good thing too, they tell me.
Ah, thank ye. I'll try it.
It's warm, isn't it? A person can't help getting warm in the summertime.
Great heavens! What's that? - It's a present from Dick. Isn't it beautiful?
When this I see, I...
I shall always remember Dick.
Yes, I should think you would.
It would be difficult to forget him.
Dick's a professional bootblack.
You'd like him. He's so square.
Square? - Yes, he wouldn't cheat anyone or hit a boy under his size.
Oh. Very praiseworthy.
Thank ye.
What's the matter?
Don't you like your soup? - Oh, yes.
I was just wondering.
- Wondering? Wondering what?
You don't wear your coronet all the time, then?
No, no. It, er, it doesn't become me.
Mr. Hobbs said you wore it all the time.
After he thought it over, he said you must take it off sometimes to put your hat on.
Yes, I, ah...
I take it off occasionally.
You must be very proud of your house.
I never saw anything so beautiful.
It's a very big house for just two people to live in, isn't it?
Do you think it's too large?
I was only thinking that if two people lived in it who were not good companions, they might get a little lonely. - Do you think I shall make a good companion?
Yes, I think you will. I think you should be almost as interesting as Mr. Hobbs. - Oh.
Mr. Hobbs and I were very great friends.
He was the best friend I had expect...
Fauntleroy, what are you thinking of?
- I was thinking of Dearest.
Who is Dearest?
- She is my mother.
I... I think I'd better get up and... and walk up and down.
He's a very nice dog. He's my friend.
He knows how I feel.
How do you feel?
Come here.
You see, I... I never was away from my own house before.
It... it makes a person feel a strange feeling when he has to stay all night in another person's castle, instead of his own house.
But... but Dearest is not very far away from me. She told me to remember that.
And, after all, you know,
I'm nine, you know and I can look at the picture she gave me.
Look! You press this spring and it opens and there she is!
I suppose you think you're very fond of her?
- Yes, I do think so and it's true.
Mr. Hobbs and the others were my friends, but Dearest is my close friends.
My father left her to me to take care of.
And when I'm a man, I'm going to work and earn money for her.
Oh, and what do you think of doing?
Well, I did think of going into business with Mr. Hobbs but I should like to be president.
We'll send you to the House of Lords instead.
Well, if I couldn't be president and if that's a good business, I shouldn't mind.
The grocery business is dull sometimes.
Yes, so is the House of Lords, but it's the business that every earl of Dorincourt goes into.
- I shall have to talk to Dearest about it.
Good night.
God keep you all the night.
Morning, Thomas.
- Good morning, sir.
Where's His Lordship?
- In his library, sir and such goings on
I've never heard in my life!
- Do you think, it'll be all right?
Yes sir, he's expecting you.
- Oh!
Ah-ha.
Oh... ha, ha.
Ah...
Morning, Mordaunt.
I've found a new employment, you see.
Any good at marbles, Mordaunt?
My muscles are a little stiff, my lord, but... I'll see what I can do.
Hah, pity about that!
I'd forgotten about your age.
Ha, ha, ha.
Ouch! Oh!
This is the new Lord Fauntleroy.
Fauntleroy, this is Mr. Mordaunt, rector of the parish.
I'm very glad to make your acquaintance, sir.
I'm delighted to make your acquaintance, Lord Fauntleroy.
Well, what is it this morning, 
Mordaunt? Who's in trouble now?
It's one of your tenants, my lord. Higgins of Edge Farm.
Newick has told him that if he doesn't pay the rent he must leave the place.
He's a bad tenant, always behind,
Newick tells me.
He's devoted to his wife and children, and if the farm is taken from him, they may literally starve.
- That's like Michael!
I forgot we had a philanthropist here.
Come here.
What would you do in this case?
If I were very rich, I should let him stay and give him things for his children.
Nonsense! You're Lord Fauntleroy. It's time you learned to deal with these situations.
You can write, can't ya?
- Yes, but not very well.
Well, go over to the desk and write Newick his orders.
Now, what must I say?
- You must say:
Higgins is not to be interfered with for the present.
Oh!
And sign it, "Fauntleroy."
Do you think it will do?
Dear mr. Newik if you pleas mr. higins is
not to be inturfeared with for the present
and oblige. Yours rispecferly
"FAUNTLEROY."
Yes.
Higgins will find it entirely satisfactory.
Mr. Hobbs always signed his letters that way and I thought I’d better say "please."
Is that exactly the right way to spell "interfered?"
Well, it's not exactly the way it's spelled in the dictionary, but...
I was afraid of that.
Yes, Higgins won't complain of the spelling.
I think you must be the best person in the whole world, don't you, Mr. Mordaunt?
I shall write and tell Mr. Hobbs.
Oh, what'll you tell him?
I shall tell him I think you're the kindest man I ever heard of, and that you're always thinking of other people and making them happy and... and that I hope when I grow up
I shall be just like you!
Just like me, eh?
There you are, Mordaunt. Take that with you. - I will indeed. This is good news!
Thank you, my lord. - Oh, don't thank me, thank Fauntleroy.
Thank you.
- Good-bye, sir. - Good-bye.
May I go to see Dearest now?
I think she'll be waiting for me.
There's something for you to see in the stables first. Ring the bell.
In the stables!
If you please, I'm very much obliged, but I think I'd better see it tomorrow.
She'll be expecting me all the time.
- Ah, very well. We'll order the carriage.
You don't care to see what's in the stables? - Oh, I do! I do!
Oh, it doesn't matter, it's only a pony.
A pony! Whose pony is it?
- Yours.
Mine!
- Yes.
Oh, I never thought I'd have a pony! I never thought that!
How glad Dearest will be.
You give me everything, don't you?
Wouldn't you like to see it?
Of course I want to see it! I want to see it so much I can hardly wait but I'm afraid there isn't time.
You must see your mother this afternoon?
You can't put it off till tomorrow?
Why, she's been thinking about me all the morning and I've been thinking about her.
Oh, you have, have you?
Very well, ring the bell.
Let me give you your stick. Lean on me when you get out. - I'm not going to get out.
Not... not to see Dearest?
- Dearest will excuse me.
Tell her that even your new pony would keep you away.
She'll be disappointed.
She'll want to see you very much.
- I am afraid not.
The carriage will call for you as we come back. Drive on, Jeffries.
It's a shame, parted from his own mother.
Cook at Court Lodge was telling Sarah she'd never worked for a sweeter lady than Mrs. Errol.
The letter was written by the little gentleman his own self.
Signed with his name too, "Fauntleroy," as large as life. - The little precious!
Ay, that's the mother.
- A pretty young thing too.
Good morning, my lady.
- Good morning.
God bless you, ma'am.
- Thank you.
Good morning.
- Good morning.
It's His Lordship coming to services.
That's a new notion.
They say even 'is gout's improving.
An' look at the young lord.
- He's captain Cedric all over again.
He's the Captain's self to the life.
How glad the people are to see you.
Take off your hat, Fauntleroy.
They're bowing to you. - To me?
How do you do?
God bless, Your Lordship. Long life to ya.
Thank you.
Good morning, my lord.
[organ plays "Crown Him With Many Crowns"]
Crown Him with many crowns
The Lamb upon His throne
Hark! How the heavenly anthem drowns
All music but his own
Awake my soul, and sign
Of Him who died for thee
And Hail Him as thy matchless King
Through all eternity
Crown Him the Virgin's son
The God incarnate born
Whose arm those crimson trophies won...
May I whisper?
- What is it? - Who are they?
Some of your ancestors who lived a few hundred years ago. - Oh!
Perhaps I got my spelling from them.
...Shepherd King of Israel's fold
The Babe of Bethlehem
Well, Higgins?
- Oh, is this Mr. Higgins?
Yes, I suppose he's come to look at his new landlord. - Yes, my lord.
I understand His young Lordship was kind enough to speak for me and I thought I'd like to say a word of thanks.
I've got a great deal to thank Your Lordship for.
Oh, I only wrote the letter.
It's my grandfather who did it.
You know how good he always is to people.
Is Mrs. Higgins well now?
- Yes, Your Lordship.
The Missus is better since the trouble was took off her mind.
My grandfather was very sorry about your children having the scarlet fever.
You see, Higgins, you people have all been mistaken about me.
Lord Fauntleroy understands me. If you want a little reliable information on the subject of my character, apply to him.
Get into the carriage, Fauntleroy.
You miss your mother very much?
- Yes, sir. I miss her all the time.
You don't miss her, do you?
- I don't know her.
I know and that's what makes me wonder.
She told me not to ask any questions, and I won't.
Well, you see her almost every day, don't ye? Isn't that enough?
We used to see each other all the time and we could tell each other things without waiting.
Well, don't you ever forget about her? - No, sir. Never.
I shouldn't forget about you, you know.
If I didn't live with you I should think about you all the more.
Upon my word I believe you would!
My Dear Mr. Hobbs.
I must tell you about
my grandfather immediately.
It's all a mistake earls being 
tyrants. He's not the tyrant.
He has the gout in his
foot and is a great suffer.
He is such a good earl. He reminds
me of you. He is a universal favorite.
Well... Reminds me of you...
Think of that, now. He's known this earl only a little while, and we...
We was lifetime acquaintances.
I don't know as I want him to be reminded of me by this earl.
They been usin' influence of him, I betcha. - You're right.
They got twisty ways, those aristocrats!
They'd wheedle their little finger around your heart as soon as look at you, all for their own purposes, mind!
It's a pity they're makin' an eril outta him. - Yeah...
He would have been a shinin' light in grocery business, a shinin' light!
You know any particklars 'bout dat stuff like castles and erils?
No, not much, except they're haughty and mean.
Sure is a jim-dandy letter he wrote. Almost as good as seein' him only it ain't o' course.
Aw, he was a plumb-daisy of a kid. I betcha sometimes he wishes he was back here.
I do.
- You lonely?
Aw, not so bad.
- Where you livin' now?
Me an' two udder fellas, we got a room in a lodgin' house.
The udder two get drunk and fightin' but it's cheap.
That's no sort of a place for a lad like you to be livin'.
Now, look here, I gotta clean, dry loft over my stable and there's an old bed you can have.
Why don't you come here and stay?
It won't cost you a cent.
- Chee! D'ya mean dat, Mr. Hobbs?
Why, I certainly do.
- Ya...hoo!!
Chee, Mr. Hobbs! Talking about erils - you ain't no eril - you're a prince!
Aw, phsaw!
I wonder whether he will have an American accent.
My dear, won't it be interesting if he has the Dorincourt eyebrows? - Ha, ha, ha!
When do we see the mother? - I believe she's supposed to be kept in the background.
Well, Molyneux, is this the boy?
- Yes, Constantia, this is the boy.
Fauntleroy, this is your great-aunt,
Lady Lorridale.
How do you do. Great-Aunt? - How d'ye do young man? You're like your father.
I loved him more than most people in this wicked world.
Did you know my father?
- Know him? Of course I did.
Oh, then you must meet Dearest! She will enormously like to talk to you about him.
You see, I was the only one she could talk about him to, who knew him.
I was so small when he...
Yes, Fauntleroy, this is your great-uncle, Sir Harry Lorridale.
How do you do, sir?
- Hear, you're fond of horses.
I'll confess to you, Constantia, that what you will probably see for yourself there's a risk of my becoming rather an old fool about him. - Becoming?!
Ha, ha, ha! - By the way the mother, what does she think of you?
I don't know. I haven't asked her.
You must come over to
Lorridale Park to see us.
There are some new cocker puppies in the kennel. You shall have your pick.
Oh, thank you very much, indeed, uncle, only, Dougal might be offended.
He's very fond of me and I really shouldn't like to hurt his feelings. - Ha, ha, ha.
Hurt his feelings! That's a good one!
Did you hear that, Con?
Hurt his feelings! Ha, ha, ha!
This is Miss Herbert, Fauntleroy.
I want you to be great friends with her.
How do you do? Have you met Dougal?
He shakes hands beautifully.
Shake hands with Miss Herbert, Dougal.
He's a great friend of mine. I like making friends, don't you? - Yes, I do.
May I be your friend? And Dougal's?
- Oh, yes, if you please!
How's your lumbago, Fortescue?
Better, I hope? - Thanks. Much better.
I've known Dorincourt as well as anyone could know him for five and thirty years, and that's the first time he's ever bothered to inquire about my health!
Most extraordinary!
Well, Havisham, you're late.
What's kept you?
I beg your pardon, my lord. I was detained by extraordinary news.
News? What... what news? - Not now, if you don't mind. Later, my lord, later.
The young May moon is beaming, love
The glowworm's lamp is gleaming, love
How sweet to rove through Morna's Grove
While the drowsy world is dreaming, love
Then awake! Till rise of sun, my dear
The Sage's glass we'll shun my dear
Or in watching the flight
of bodies of light
He might happen to take
thee for one, my dear
Charming! Charming! What a sweet song!
Thank ye, my dear, thank you.
Do you like music?
- Yes. I like it when you sing it.
Tell me, Lord Fauntleroy, why you look at me so? - I was thinking how beautiful you are.
Fauntleroy, make the most of your time. When you're older, you'll not have the courage to say that!
Nobody could help saying it.
Don't you think, she's pretty too?
We're not allowed to say what we think.
- Lord Fauntleroy shall say what he thinks.
I am sure he thinks what he says.
I think you're prettier than anyone I ever saw, expect Dearest.
I think she's the prettiest person on the world. - I'm sure she is.
And I must tell her how kind you’ve been to me.
I never was at a party before, and I've enjoyed myself so much.
Oh, I beg your pardon.
Good night, little Lord 
Fauntleroy. Sleep well.
Good night. So glad you came.
Well, Havisham, what in the world's the matter?
Something serious must have happened to make you behave like this. What is it?
It's bad news, the very worst of news, my lord.
I'm sorry to have to be the bearer of it.
Why do you look at the boy so? You hang over him like a bird of ill omen.
Has it anything to do with Fauntleroy?
My lord, I'll waste no words. My news has everything to do with him.
If we are to believe it, it's not Lord
Fauntleroy who lies asleep before us, but only the son of Captain Errol.
The present Lord Fauntleroy is the son of your boy Bevis, and at this moment is in a lodging house in London.
- What do you mean? You're mad!
It's a lie!
An abominable lie!
If it's a lie, it's painfully like the truth.
A woman came to my chambers this morning and told me that she married your son Bevis in London 11 years ago.
She showed me the marriage certificate.
The child was born shortly after Bevis deserted her and was taken by her to America.
The woman's obviously an imposter!
It's a trumped-up fraud!
I'm afraid not, my lord.
I saw the boy's birth certificate.
She is, I'm afraid, a very ignorant person but she has consulted a lawyer who advises her, that her son is, of course,
Lord Fauntleroy and the rightful heir.
She demands that his claim be immediately acknowledged.
I'll protest this to the last!
I'll disown Bevis' boy!
I'll have nothing to do with him or his mother! - You can't disown him, my lord.
Nothing we can do can keep the eldest son's child from his inheritance.
The woman, you say is an ignorant vulgar person, eh?
She can hardly spell her own name. She is obviously uneducated and openly mercenary.
And I... I objected to his mother.
I suppose it's retribution.
If anyone have ever told me that I could be fond of a child,
I wouldn't have believed them.
I always detested children - my own more than most.
But I'm fond of him, and oddly enough - he's fond of me.
You know, Havisham, I'm not popular. I never was but he is fond of me.
He never was afraid of me, always trusted me.
Yes, Havisham, he'd have filled my place better than I've filled it.
He'd have been an honor to the name.
You rang, my lord?
Take... take Lord Fauntleroy to his room.
What a pity! The boy's thoroughbred if ever there was one.
I suppose you may say it's a judgment of Molyneux.
That boy... the first human being he ever loved!
Will Molyneux take the case to the courts d'you think?
Can't tell. He's obstinate enough.
You go in with your best suit, buckles on your shoes and you come out as nature made you
Bless my soul, Constantia, whoever would have dreamed that I'd felt sorry for the old boy!
I wouldn't have minded our having a boy like that, Harry.
Yes, bit of luck for us, old girl, if we had. - Yeah.
I'll tell you one thing - if his
Little Lordship loses his title, the village loses the best friend it has.
That's right. An' I'll tell you another thing - it'll drive the earl mad if this goes wrong for him.
He's been so proud of the boy, you hardly believe it if you knew him for what he was before.
- And the new one's no lady, that's sure.
Bold-faced thing, that's what she is.
The dark-eyed brazen-faced wench!
'Ere's the earl comin' now with Mr. Havisham.
You've somebody here calling herself
Lady Fauntleroy? I want to see her.
Come the ways, my lord. This way, my lord.
Come in.
T' earl of Dorincourt!
Pleased to meetcha, I'm sure, my lord.
Bevis!
Go shake hands with your grandpa.
So that's the way you're gonna treat your grandson?
You needn't try to look so fierce about it - he's your grandson all right!
Ah, yes, me lord, we have proof of young gentleman's birth.
He is the son of the late Lord Fauntleroy.
Allow me to introduce myself.
Joshua Snade at your service. My card.
I've already had the pleasure of making
Mr. Havisham's acquaintance.
Lady Fauntleroy has placed all the evidence in my hands.
I can assure you, lord, it is sufficient to justify her case should it come into court.
But may I suggest that, uh, we come to an arrangement and settle this matter amicably on a friendly basis...
Friendly? Huh!
Look at him starin' as though I was dirt! His own daughter-in-law!
Oh, your son Bevis married me, all right and a fine rotter he was!
But he was the father and I can prove it! - Lady Fauntleroy, please...
You may think you can fight me - a lot of good it'll do!
They don't love you - you know it!
I've heard plenty about you and your dirty, snobbish pride!
Plenty of pride you'll have when
I'm finished with you!
Unless you want to get reasonable with your own flesh and blood.
Lady Fauntleroy, I beg you...
- Shut up!
I'll stop at nothing! I drag this case through every court.
I'll let the world know what you are - you and your precious son Bevis!
Deserting me and his own child - a babe in arms!
How I've suffered, heaven only knows!
And you standin' and lookin' at me and my boy as if we was scum!
You ought to be ashamed of yourself!
You say you married my eldest son.
If that's proved to be true, the law's on your side.
In that case your son will be Lord
Fauntleroy. and you will be provided for.
But I warn you - the matter will be sifted to the very bottom.
I'll only add that I want to see nothing of you or your boy as long as I live.
After my death, you can, unfortunately, do as you please.
Yes, you're exactly the kind of person that I should have expected my son Bevis to choose.
Ha, ha, ha!
I'm afraid, Dorincourt, there can be no two opinions.
At least, that's how I see it.
You agree, Semple?
Yes, I'm afraid we can see it no other way. - But it's... it's monstrous!
That woman... that boy are utterly unfit!
Alas, the law can take no cognizance of such things.
I sympathize, Dorincourt, more than I can say. - Sympathize! What's the use of that?
If we take it to the courts there can be only one result? - I'm afraid so.
The birth certificate, everything we have, point the same way.
If you take it to court, you'll have the expense and notoriety, and only, I fear, one possible result.
Perhaps the boy won't turn out so badly as you fear.
Perhaps you can do something with him. - That boy?
That... oaf!
With the other one - yes.
Well...
I have no other course but to accept your judgment.
Come, Havisham. - Thank you, my lord.
- And you, Mr. Semple.
It's the earl, ma'am. The earl himself!
Show him in.
Mrs. Errol, I believe.
- Yes, I'm Mrs. Errol.
I'm Lord Dorincourt.
The boy is very like you.
People have often said so.
I'm glad to think he's like his father too. - Yes, he is - like my son.
Won't you sit down?
- Thank you.
I've come to tell you that I've had the very best, the highest legal opinion.
But I'm sorry. This outrageous woman and her child...
Perhaps she cares for him as much as
I care for Ceddie, my lord.
Her son is Lord Fauntleroy - mine's not.
Yes, I'm afraid you're right.
Perhaps you would have preferred that
Ceddie should not be the earl of Dorincourt.
It's a very magnificent thing to be the earl of Dorincourt, my lord. I know that.
But all I care about is that Ceddie should be what his father was - brave, just and kind always.
Hmm, a striking contrast to what his grandfather is, eh?
I haven't had the pleasure of knowing his grandfather.
I know my little boy believes...
I know that Ceddie loves you.
Would he, if you have told him why
I didn't receive you at the castle?
No, honestly, I think not. That's why I didn't wish him to know.
Well... there are very few women who wouldn't have told him.
Dearest, Ceddie is fond of me.
And I am fond of him.
I can't say that I was ever fond of anyone before.
But he pleased me from the first.
I'm an old man and
I was tired of my life.
But he's given me something to live for.
More than that - more than that, I am proud of him!
I was satisfied to think that one day he'd be taking my place as the head of the family.
I'm miserable... miserable!
Please, sit down. You've been so much troubled, you must be tired and you need all your strength.
Thank you.
Perhaps it's because I'm miserable, I've come to you.
I used to hate you.
I've been jealous to you.
But this wretched disgraceful business has changed all that.
And after seeing this repulsive woman who...
Well, I felt it would be a relief to come to you.
I'm an obstinate old fool, I suppose.
I... I know I've treated you badly.
But I've come to you because the boy cares for you and because I care for him.
Treat me as well as you can for the boy's sake.
Whatever happens, he shall be provided for.
Ceddie shall be taken care of now, and in the future.
Always!
- Thank you.
Do you like the house?
Oh, very much.
It's a cheerful room.
May I come back again and talk this matter over?
As often as you wish.
You've heard bad news, haven't you?
- Yes. The worst.
Then I'm not Lord Fauntleroy anymore, am I?
No, she's beaten me.
Then, the other boy... he will... have to be... your boy now, won't he? Like I was?
- No!
But he'll have to live in the castle if he's Lord Fauntleroy, won't he?
That common little brat shall never enter this place in my lifetime!
I'll take care of that!
Then, I can still be your boy even if I'm not going to be the earl just like I was before?
My boy!
Yes, you'll be my boy as long as I live.
And, by Jove, sometimes I think you're the only boy I've ever had!
Then, I don't care about the earl part at all.
I thought, you see, that the one that was going to be the earl had to be your boy and that I couldn't be.
They shall never take anything from you that I can hold for you.
Come what may, you shall have all that I can give - all!
And Dearest? Will the house be taken away from her?
No, they can take nothing from her - nothing from either of you!
Come, it's time you were asleep.
Good night, Grandfather.
-. Good night, my boy.
...the aged earl remains
secluded in his castle
and refuses to have any communication
with the rightful heir.
We know dat stuff. Dey've been printing 'dat for de past week
Is dere anyt'ing new about Ceddie?
Yes! Here it says.
The prospects do not look very bright for the
false claimant, Cedric Errol of Brooklyn.
Well, I'm jiggered.
At last they've succeeded in robbin' him outta bein' a earl.
I thought you was ag'inst erils?
- So I am!
Ain't it just like 'em - cheatin' the poor kid outta his rightful estates!
Now, what's goin' to become of him?
I know one thing. He done everyt'ing for me - he can always come back an' have half of my shoe-shining business.
Well now, I'll tell you, Dick,
I'd always had it in my mind that Ceddie would come in with me someday.
He'd be a shining light in the grocery business.
The new Lady Fauntleroy
was formerly an actress.
She is said to have played in New York
and London. Continued in page 5.
Here's a picture of her.
Holy mackerel!
- What?
Look at this! it's her!
- Her?
She ain't no 'ristocrat! I know her as
I know you! It's Minna, Ben's wife!
Your brother's? - Sure!
- You mean it's some hocus-pocus?
Sure I do.
- Well, I'm jiggered.
She was married before - I never hoid of her havin' no other kid but Ben's.
The one Ben went to look for?
- Sure.
Maybe she had another kid in England.
- Maybe she did - maybe she didn't.
We'd oughta do somethin' about it.
- You're dead right, we'd oughta!
But we gotta get the proper advice.
- Chee, I wisht I knew Alderman Moiphy.
I know Alderman Moiphy.
Ya do? - Yeah, come along, let's go right now!
Them earls! They've always had a spite against us Americans ever since the revolution!
What a place! What a hole!
I'm sick to death of it!
Cooped up here week in and week out with nobody to talk to!
You're complimentary!
- I wasn't meaning to be! - I'm grateful.
You're getting your money, aren't you?
- Business is business, you know.
Business! I'm sick of business! I want some fun! - Why don't you go to London?
London? Not on your tintype!
Nothing would please that old devil at the castle better than to see me clear out.
Well, I'll stay here... here in this rotten country pub if I...
You've lived in worse places, I've no doubt! - That's none of your business!
You keep a civil tongue or I'll hand you your walking papers! - I wouldn't.
What do you mean? - Just what I said.
I wouldn't try anything like that, Minna.
I'm Lady Fauntleroy, to you!
- Ha, ha.
Come in!
Why, it's Lord Dorincourt!
Why, this is a pleasure, a real pleasure, I'm sure. Won't you take a...
Hello, Minna.
Why, hello, Dick.
Why, Ben. What are you doing here?
Where have you been all this time?
You knew her? - Funny, if he didn't... seein' how he was my second husband.
Where is the child? - What child?
- You know, our boy, Tom.
Oh, Ben, but you know...
You must have heard...
Someone must have told you.
- Told me what?
It was pneumonia. Only three days and he was gone. It broke my heart.
I meant to write.
I didn't know where you were.
If that's true, who is this boy you've got with you?
That's none of your business, Ben Tipton!
Can I see him? - You can't! - Tell us why
Mr. Tipton should not see your boy?
Oh, hello, Uncle Dick.
Well, I'll be jiggered!
Mom, honest, I'm sorry...
- Shut up!
You're a dirty pair, comin' to spy on me!
Tryin' to do me hurt!
I'll have the law on ya for houndin' me, you... you... you...
Silence!
Come here, Tom.
I knew nothing, my lord, I assure you!
There's a little matter of a forged birth certificate. - But I swear to you!
Never mind, Havisham.
I've had enough of this - too much!
The sooner you are out of this country, the better!
Come on, Havisham. - You'll be sorry - you will!
It's prosecution, that's what it is - it's robbery!
The Earl of Dorincourt and Ceddie requests
the pleasure of Mr. Silas Hobbs company
 on the eleventh of May at 
8 p.m. at Dorincourt Castle
of the occasion of the tenth birthday
of his grandson Lord Fauntleroy.
This will be somewhat in the manner of a museum, my lord?
Not exactly a museum, Mr. Hobbs.
They are portraits of my ancestors.
Your aunt's sisters!["ancestors"] All of them?
Well, I'll be jiggered! Your great-uncle, he must have had a family!
Did he raise 'em all?
Ah, you mean that they were early distinguished members of the family.
Do you know, earl, I used to have a very poor opinion of your aristocracy, but I've changed. Take you, for instance, you're a good sort, even if you are an earl!
I'm very gratified.
A bit gay, wasn't he? - Yes, that's why
I have the gout, Mr. Hobbs.
Oh!
And they was all earls! And Ceddie's goin' to be one and own all this!
And he'll be worthy of it, Mr. Hobbs.
- Sure he will.
All these earls!
Do you know, I wouldn't have minded bein' one myself! - Hmm!
Speech! Speech! Speech!
Speech! Speech!
Thank you very much.
It's such a lovely day. I always like having birthdays, but never one so much as this, because you're all so kind to me.
My grandfather wants everybody to be happy and comfortable and I'll want it too when I'm grown up.
I think that's all, because I'm not very good of making speeches.
But I must say that I'm very much obliged to you for liking my birthday.
Ripping little nipper!
- Ain't he a daisy?
I'll bet you boids elect him king some day!
I didn't know the little feller could talk so good.
He makes a better speech than
Alderman Murphy - by Jove.
Ugh, well, I'll be jiggered!
And I've another birthday present for you.
Another one, besides all the things this morning? - Yes, the best of them all.
Oh, Dearest!
Oh, Dearest!
Oh, Dearest, I was wanting you here!
I was wanting you here so terribly much!
Were you, darling?
Fauntleroy, your mother has come to live in the castle.
To live with us, to live with us for always?
- Are you sure you really want me?
We always wanted you, but we weren't exactly aware of it.
Well, Mr. Hobbs, it's so nice having you here with us.
I dread to think of you going back to America.
Not to live there!
America's a good enough country for them that's young and stirrin', but there's faults in it! There's not an aunt's sister among 'em, nor an earl!
Hey, what did the blue jay say
To the little sparrow on the fence one day
Say, you'll never guess, so I
Will tell you what I overheard while passing by
The blue jay said " How do you do
Mr. Sparrow, how are you"
The sparrow said " How do I do
I do just as I please" and then away he flew
Hey, what did the blue jay say
To the little sparrow as he flew away
Say, nobody ever heard
Because he didn't get a chance to say a word
The blue jay didn't notice
That on the fence there was a cat
The sparrow flew but the blue jay sat
And now he's just a little bird on Nellie's hat
Hey, hey! Beautiful, beautiful!
That performance touched my heart!
I, for one, will contribute a dollar.
Er, gentlemen? Yes.
That's... fine.
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.
Come on, fellas!
Help! Help! Help! I got robbed!
I've been robbed! Help!
- I've been robbed! Help! Help!
- The professor's at it again.
Come on, fellas.
We gotta meet the professor.
Not me. The rest of youse kids can wind up in jail, but not me.
We're not going to jail.
We're going to Washington Square.
- What's the matter? What's up?
- It's the professor.
- He's picked a pocket again.
- You take that back!
You can't inflect on my grandfather like that!
- Take it back!
- All right.
You don't think the professor would take anything that didn't belong to him?
That's just the trouble with the professor!
He don't seem to know what belongs to him and what doesn't.
The professor's one of the "honestest" men in the world.
And, besides, he's reformed.
Ah, my pupils.
- Professor!
- Yes, what is it, my little tuberose?
Tell them you didn't take anything from that man.
What do you mean, steal?
Why, who suggested such a thing?
- We did!
- Oh, you did.
Well, now I ask you, is this gratitude... after all I've done for you boys?
- I'm ashamed of you.
- You see?
Yes. As a matter of fact,
I just learned of a big party uptown... where, if we hurry, we can pick up a penny or two playing for the guests.
Come along.
- Come on.
- Well, maybe he is honest, but if it happens again...
Come on, boys. Sit down!
Skinny, would you please sit over here?
Cunning, aren't they?
Especially the little one.
Tsk! The hats!
Can't you see you're in a swell house?
Wouldn't it be amusing to have them play at our wedding reception?
We could dress them up and...
Allen, you're not listening.
Huh? Oh, our wedding.
Yes, yes. Of course.
- Allen.
- What?
Never mind.
Come on, boys. Tune up.
Stop sniffling like that.
Here, use this.
A sad thing to say at best.
Thoroughly disapprove of it.
Stop mumbling, Jasper.
I can't understand your nephew bringing these filthy little street Arabs here.
They'd steal your hoops if they could get their hands on them.
I'll thank you not to get personal, Jasper.
He was a dandy
Yes, he was a dandy
He was a dandy and she was a belle
She wore a bonnet with blue ribbons on it
And he wore a flower in
His coat lapel
He was so handsome
And she was oh, so fair
While strolling on the avenue
Folks would stop and stare
For he was a dandy
Yes, he was a dandy
He was a dandy and she was a belle
She wore a bonnet with a stuffed tomato on it
And he wore a flower in
His coat lapel
We've been robbed.
All our furs, everything.
A burglar's been in and has stolen everything!
- What did I tell ya? He's done it again.
- He did not.
- I know he didn't!
- Just the same, I'm through! Come on.
He did not! He did not!
Police! Police!
Police! Police!
I'm caught!
- Somebody broke in the window.
- What?
I haven't any doubt these ragamuffins are part of the scheme, sent here to divert our attention from the thief.
- Will you stop mumbling?
- They've caught one of them.
- Leave me alone. I didn't do anything.
- We'll take you right in.
- I don't know nothing about it.
- We caught this one in the balustrade.
I trust you weren't injured in the struggle.
Why, no, ma'am... not a scratch.
Come here, dear.
Don't be afraid. You and Jasper... take these gallant officers upstairs... and get a description of the things that were taken.
Give my apologies to my guests and assure them I will replace everything.
- But doesn't this one go to jail?
- Oh, don't be an idiot.
Come, dear.
I didn't do anything.
Honest, I didn't.
- I'm too little.
- Are you?
- Won't you let me go?
- Where would you go?
- Home.
- Where's home?
- With the professor.
- The professor?
- Who's the professor?
- Oh, don't you know him?
Why, everybody knows the professor.
He's a fine gentleman and an "aristocrack."
Oh.
- Is that cake?
- Suppose you find out.
Help yourself, my dear.
- Hey, Professor, wait a minute!
- What is it?
Professor, they got her!
The police. They got her!
- They got who? They got Dimples?
- Yes, sir!
Oh, uh... Here, uh...
Say, the professor's awful strict with his students.
He watches 'em very close so they won't do nothing bad.
And he scolds them if they're naughty.
But singing and playing in the street?
Isn't it rather odd... for a music teacher to permit that?
Aw, that's just practice.
If they practice at home, the neighbors throw bottles through the windows.
Which do you like best, chocolate or vanilla?
I like chocolate and vanilla.
I wish the professor was here.
He likes vanilla cake.
Help! Stop thief!
Help! Stop thief!
Oh, he got away.
The thief got away.
- Are you hurt, sir?
- Oh, he was a big fellow.
Too big for me.
I'm not as young as I once was.
- What's going on down there?
- This gentleman almost caught the thief.
- He got nearly everything back.
- Wonderful!
Won't you come in, sir?
I'd like to see you.
Oh, thank you, madam.
I'd be delighted.
Well, I did no more than my duty as a citizen.
Ah, and not unlike the home of my childhood.
Dimples, my darling.
- You're all right.
- I knew you'd come.
- It's the professor.
- Ah, delighted.
Do you see? If anything's been stolen, always send for the professor... and, generally, you can get it back.
Uh, yeah. Well,
I wouldn't go as far as to say that.
You've rendered me a valuable service, sir. I can't thank you enough.
Oh, madam. I, uh, I was passing... in front of your, uh... cottage... when the culprit emerged from the bushes.
I seized him and grappled with him, but he was young and I am not the Eustace Appleby that I was... when I stroked the Yale crew to victory.
If it wouldn't embarrass you, I'd like you to accept a little something.
Oh, no, no, madam.
Thank you. Not for me.
Any American would have done the same.
But, of course, if you'd like to, uh, remember the child with a little something...
- Oh, no.
- Eh, no.
Just a little souvenir. $100 or...
Perhaps 75.
Is there anything you'd especially like, dear?
Well, there is one thing.
- Yes.
- What is it, dear?
If it's not too much,
I'd like another little piece of that chocolate cake.
- Of course, child!
- Oh, dear.
How big a piece do you want?
A big piece or a real big piece?
Give her all the cake and some of the cookies.
Here you are, dear.
Now tell me, where do you live?
- In the rookery, in Cherry Street.
- The rookery?
Just sort of camping out... the Depression, you know.
Oh, yes. Good night, my dear.
- Will you come and see me again, soon?
- Yes, ma'am.
I'd like to.
Do you always have chocolate cake?
I will, whenever you come and see me.
Well, come, my little rosebud.
It's passed our bedtime, you know.
Au revoir.
Oh!
- Cicero!
- Yes, sir.
Yes, I wasn't sleepin'.
I was just restin' my eyes.
Well, this is hardly what a gentleman expects of a gentleman's gentleman.
A flne way you choose to welcome your master home after the day's commerce.
There should be a blazing fire, hot punch.
Yes, sure would be nice.
- But...
- I was never without my nightcap.
I never knowed you had but the one cap, Mr...
I have put up with your perpetual unconsciousness!
I've overlooked your careless treatment of my establishment!
But no one can remain on my domestic staff... and speak slightingly of the Appleby wardrobe.
I am known as the beau of Cherry Street.
As for you, Cicero,
I have come to the conclusion... that this apartment is not big enough for both of us.
Uh, maybe we can get a bigger apartment...
Out of my sight! You're flred!
If there's nothing I can do about it.
Nothing! Nothing! Absolutely nothing,
Cicero. Our paths part.
No, now what time you want me to be back in the morning?
Oh, I should say 7:45, Cicero, as usual.
That's all right.
I hope you find your cap.
- Professor.
- What is it, my little apple cheeks?
- Why did you take that clock?
- Clock?
W-What clock would that be, my sweet?
I remember no clock.
The one you put your hat over.
I saw you.
Why, of course not.
You ought to know that I wouldn't take a small clock like that.
I mean, I wouldn't take any clock, large or small.
After all, my dear child,
I'm a musician, not a thief.
All right, Professor.
All I can say is that... this is a coincidence that leaves me embarrassed... and nonplussed.
I wouldn't convict a dog on circumstantial evidence.
And, yet, it's as broad as it is long.
I admit that, now and then,
I'm tempted... to pick up some small article that doesn't belong to me.
But, on the other hand,
I'm just as likely... to leave something behind that's mine.
I didn't leave my hat at Mrs. Drew's, did I?
I... Oh, no.
I have it here.
Well...
Would you like me to give you a birdcall or two?
Maybe the whippoorwill at twilight to help you to go to sleep?
No!
Why, child, back so soon and so early?
- I brought it back.
- Brought what back?
- Your cuckoo clock.
- Why?
What on earth are you doing with this?
I, I... Well, I stole it last night.
- Well!
- It's a funny thing about me.
I'm so wicked. Isn't it awful?
- You stole this?
- Right under your very nose.
I really don't know what's to become of me, I'm so bad.
Professor says he doesn't know.
He says I'm gonna wind up in the "pinchitentiary" if not in jail.
Are you sure someone else didn't take this?
Oh, goodness!
You don't mean the professor, do you?
He wouldn't take it. He's too honest.
He made me bring it back.
Are you, are you going to have me arrested?
Well... I really believe I should.
But I don't imagine you're a very hardened criminal.
Come in.
Colonel Loring and Miss Betty to see you, ma'am.
- The Lorings?
- Yes, ma'am, and the colonel... is ravin' somethin' awful, Mrs. Drew.
- Well, don't stand there, Rufus.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Tell him I'll be right down.
- Yes, ma'am.
You wait here, darling.
I want to talk to you.
Hey, what did the bluebird say
Well, if it isn't Miss, uh... Miss...
Appleby. Sylvia Dolores Appleby.
They call me Dimples.
Do you like that cuckoo?
Us Applebys know all about birds.
Someday I'll have the professor come over and do some cuckoo calls for you.
He can cuckoo even better than the cuckoo can cuckoo.
Mmm, quite a talented family.
Oh, yes.
We Applebys are very talented.
Why, even the professor used to be the best actor in the world, he says.
I suppose you want to go on stage too.
Someday I'm going to.
I'm going to play Macbeth, just like the professor did.
Wouldn't you like to play a younger part?
Say, a little girl like yourself?
Well, maybe... just to begin with.
I'll tell you what you do.
You have your grandfather take you to the National Theater to see a friend... a beautiful young lady.
Here. I'll write her name down for you.
- Is she an actress?
- Yes.
Are you in love with her?
- Why, I...
- I beg your pardon, sir.
- Your aunt wants to see you.
- Thank you, Rufus.
- Well, come along, Dimples.
- Your aunt told me to wait here.
- Allen, maybe you can explain.
- Explain what, Aunt Caroline?
- I want to break our engagement, Allen.
- Oh.
- Is that all you can say?
- I'm sorry it had to happen this way, but I think Betty is right.
It would be the best thing for both of us.
But why? I don't understand.
- You see, Aunt Caroline...
- I'll tell you why.
It's common gossip that Allen has become involved with an actress, that he spends most of his time with these low people of the theater.
He's even talking about putting up money to produce a play for this creature!
I regret that I had to tell you this, Caroline, but it's time you knew.
Oh.
Allen, it isn't true what he said about the actress, is it?
I'm afraid it is, Aunt Caroline.
Of all things, an actress.
Allen, how could you?
You know how I hate the theater and all that it stands for.
- I love her, and we're to be married.
- Married?
Alan, you can't do it!
I won't let you ruin your life!
My mind is made up, Aunt Caroline.
You're an ungrateful, disobedient, shameless boy.
And as long as you stay in my house,
I must insist that you observe my wishes!
In that case, I'll have to look for another place to stay.
Allen.
I'm sorry, Aunt Caroline.
I'd hoped you'd understand.
If you leave this house, you need never expect to come back to it... as long as I live.
I'll get my things.
Child, are you hurt?
I don't think so.
Nope. I feel dandy.
Oh, well, you frightened me.
Oh, that was nothing.
Once I fell off the roof of McGuire Saloon.
- Good heavens! Were you hurt?
- No.
- I fell on Mrs. O'Casey.
- Mrs. O'Casey?
Yes. She's fat and very soft.
Once I was leaning out of a hayloft, and Skinny waved to me and...
What? You're crying.
Oh, no, child.
Is it because he's going away?
Yes. I'm going to miss him.
He was all I had.
Now he's leaving me.
Sometimes I wonder if men are worth all the trouble they give us.
Hello, Mrs. O'Casey!
Hello! Hello, Dimples!
How are you, Mrs. O'Casey?
How's Mr. O'Casey?
That's Mrs. O'Casey.
She's the lady I fell on.
- Hello, Skinny!
- Hello, Dimples!
He's not really skinny.
We just call him that.
- Won't you sit down, Mrs. Drew?
- Thank you.
And Cicero. Cicero!
- Yes, sir. I was just outside.
- Oh, there you are.
- Yes. A little tea for Mrs. Drew.
- Tea?
Spread the table. You can pour.
- Pour what?
- Uh, no. No, thank you.
- Oh, you're quite sure?
- Yes.
Well, then Cicero, you can get on with your marketing.
- Market?
- Let me see.
I think I'd relish a nice flllet for dinner.
- We ain't never paid...
- Cooked in your own inimitable ways.
Yes.
There's a quiet splendor about the aboriginal servant, Mrs. Drew.
Which, unfortunately, is not always shared by their masters.
Professor, your granddaughter is a remarkable child... an appealing child.
As briefly as I've known her,
I've become... very fond of her.
Yes, that's easy to see, Mrs. Drew, and quite easy to understand too.
In fact, I'm so fond of her, that I want to propose something to you... something for her good.
I'm going to ask you to let her come and live with me... and let me do all I can for her.
You mean that I-I should give Dimples up?
Well, this sort of life... isn't what a child should have.
You understand that.
For all your love and devotion, you aren't helping Dimples.
You're hurting her.
You may even ruin her whole life.
But I-I-I... I love Dimples.
I know that.
That's why I'm asking it of you.
It wouldn't mean a complete separation.
You could see her whenever you wished.
- And perhaps I could help you too.
- How?
Perhaps I might ease your life, provide you with a sum of money, say $5,000.
Five thousand dollars for Dimples?
Five thousand, if you let her come and live with me.
Oh...
I must run along, Professor.
You give a lot of thought to what I've said. I'm sure you'll agree with me.
Good-bye, darling.
I'm going to see you again soon.
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.
Please don't sell me, Professor.
- Please.
- Why, bless your heart.
I wouldn't sell you for all the money in the world.
I thought you might want the $5,000.
Oh, my sweet, sweet child.
There's nothing in the whole world that could take you from me.
Nothing.
I... I love you, Professor.
I'm gonna make myself worthy of that love.
When somebody loves somebody
Everything and everybody
Makes life
A happy song
When somebody has nobody
Birds won't sing and that somebody
Finds life without a song
If you want to see a picture
Of the whole world upside down
Just picture me
Without you
And you without me
Just close your eyes and you'll see
How lonesome we'd be
Stars would fall, dreams would all
Crumble
Down for good
Castles would tumble
There'd be no me
Without you
No you without me
And yet nobody could be
As happy as we
Smiling through, clinging
Together
What would I do
Without you
And you without me
It's all for the best, Allen.
You're free now.
Of course.
I just feel sorry for Aunt Caroline.
She's done so much for me.
If she knew I'd actually gone into the theater business, well... I believe she'd change her name.
That's better than what you thought she'd do... cut you off without a cent.
- Oh, she did that.
- She did?
Yes. But I have some money of my own.
That's how I made Le Douve play.
All the same,
I hate having to hurt her.
You've made me happy.
Isn't that important too?
So important that I'm glad
I gave up everything else to do it.
I'm going to have my name on the bills and a star on my dressing room door?
A dozen stars.
Remember now,
we start to leave the minute
I refuse his first offer.
That, uh, sounds like Professor Appleby.
I sent for him to talk about his grandchild.
She'd be perfect for the part of the little girl.
It's mighty shrewd of Drew to send for me.
An actor of my reputation can't hurt him. After all...
- Well, I knew it was you. Come in.
- Ah...
Yes. Yes.
This is Professor Appleby and his granddaughter, um...
Sylvia Dolores Appleby.
But they call me Dimples.
Oh, yes. Miss Cleo Marsh.
- Oh, I'm greatly honored, Miss Marsh.
- Hello.
Miss Marsh has the leading role in our new play.
Ah, opposite me, I suppose.
There's nothing I like better than to get my teeth into a good romantic role.
"But soft! What light through yonder window breaks?
"It is the east and Juliet is the sun.
Arise..." Uh.
- "Arise..."
- "Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon."
Yes. "Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon."
Isn't he simply wonderful?
I was quite a matinee idol in those days.
I still get letters from ladies in the towns where I played.
- Yes.
- Yes.
- Landladies.
- Eh, oh, oh, no.
- No. I...
- Well, uh,
Shakespeare isn't exactly what I had in mind.
- Oh, no?
- Well, do your birdcalls.
- They're beautiful.
- Yes, yes.
Mr. Drew, you'd better close your windows.
- Your room will be full of birds.
- Oh, I don't mind that.
Oh, very well.
Eh, let me see, uh.
Uh, yes. The, uh, the, uh, the robin calling to the blue jay.
The blue jay responding.
Isn't that simply wonderful?
But they sound the same to me.
I can't tell any difference.
Aha, but the bird can.
- Yes.
- Well, I wanted to talk about, Dimples.
Oh, you want her too?
Well, you're shrewder than I thought, Mr. Drew.
My granddaughter and I make an excellent team.
Just watch us. Cicero,
"The Fling."
That's a charming dance, but we couldn't possibly...
- We can do jokes too.
- Yes.
Professor, I sent for you because I wanted Dimples... for a part in the new play
I'm going to produce.
I hate to disappoint you, but I wanted her, not you.
Oh, well, that's flne. Fine.
Couldn't you flx it so the professor could do it instead of me?
I'm sorry, but the part is for a little girl.
Then you'd better get some other little girl.
I wouldn't be any good without the professor.
Your grandfather could work right along with us, if he wanted to.
- Yes.
- The theater business is new to me.
I could use a helper, sort of an assistant.
Sir, I've never been an assistant in my life.
- Oh, I'm sorry and...
- I'll make an exception in this case.
- Splendid!
- Yes.
I-I congratulate you, Mr. Drew.
No Appleby has ever been associated with a failure.
And with us in your organization, your play is a success already.
Didn't I tell you he was wonderful?
Quite.
You're going to do a beautiful play, Dimples... a play that's never been produced before.
It's about a little girl named Eva... who tries to help the slaves down South... and an old colored man who loves her named Uncle Tom.
The gospel train is a-comin'

- Oh, get on board
- Get on, children

Get on board little children

You gave me $40... to pay for the tickets.
I had them printed for $37.50.
That leaves you a clear profit of $2 and a half, and here it is to the penny.
- Yes, sir, to the penny.
- Fine. You've done an excellent job.
Yes. And now I'll need
$95 for advertising.
As long as you're paying the bills,
I think it would save time if you handled all the money.
Uh... oh.
Here it is. About $800.
It's all I have left and just enough to finance the rest of the production.
Uh, uh, all right.
You trust me with this?
Yes, of course.
Well, thank you very much,
Allen, for your faith in me.
I'll, uh, I'll handle this money... just as though it were my own.
- Professor?
- Yeah?
What does that sign say?
Uh. Oh.
It, uh, it says, uh...
Oh, yeah, it says,
"No Smoking Allowed."
Well, then why don't you stop smoking?
Well, I...
- Uh, oh, yeah.
- Well, I'II give you $600.
Sir, do you realize this was Napoleon's watch, given to him by Josephine the night before Waterloo?
Why it's worth $ 2,000 if it's worth a cent.
I'II put it up to a stranger.
Ah, there's a gentleman... who looks like he might know something about antique jewelry.
He wouldn't know anything about jewelry.
I, sir, am a recognized authority... which leads me not to recognize your remark.
My good man, what would you say a watch like this is worth?
Uh, oh, that's a superb antique.
I, uh, I had one just like it myself.
There you are, and I never saw this gentleman before in all my life.
I'll give you $700 for it.
I haven't the money here, but if you'll come to my bank with me,
I'll give you $800 for it.
I'm sorry, gentlemen.
Yea, it grieves me, but my boat is departing for the Orient in half an hour.
And, well, I guess I'll have to give it to Richards.
- You're a very lucky man, sir.
- J-Just a minute.
- Can I talk to you a second?
- Oh, yes. Of course.
I hate to see Richards get a bargain like that.
- I don't like him.
- I detest him.
If you could get ahold of that watch and come up to my bank in Harlem,
I'd take it off your hands... and I'll give you $10 for your trouble.
Oh... could you make that $15?
- You drive a hard bargain. I'll do it.
- Heh!
- There you are, sir, $700.
- I'll give you $800 for the watch.
But I haven't got any more money.
You said it was mine for $700.
- Oh, no. This gentleman gets it for $800.
- Thank you very much.
I consider this a great favor.
But look here, that's hardly fair.
I came here with $700 to buy a watch, and you give it to someone else.
Here. Here's the watch.
- Watch? What watch?
- Why, it's Napoleon's watch.
You have the wrong man.
I'm not Napoleon.
Uh, you're not... No.
But you said... You told me...
I never saw you before in my life, sir!
You ne... Why, here... Uh...
Uh! Oh, eh, eh, eh, eh...
Don't you see that sign?
- Well? Who's smoking?
- Huh...
- Well, seeing you're a friend of mine...
- Yes?
I'll, uh, give you a dollar and a half for it.
A dollar and a...
You don't understand.
- This watch belonged to Napoleon.
- It did, eh?
- Yes.
- Well, that makes it secondhand.
Sec...
Ah, Tom, my boy, the whole world is empty as an eggshell.
I know it, massah, I know it.
- It seems to be given...
- Ah, there you are, Professor Appleby.
- We've been waiting for you.
- Yes? Well, to what do I owe that honor?
Well, we supplied you everything for your play.
We're the creditors, one might say, and Mr. Drew told us you would give us our money.
- Money? What money?
- The money Mr. Drew owes for scenery.
- And the costumes and the...
- Oh, yes, that money.
You're surely not suggesting that
Mr. Drew and I intend to defraud you.
Mr. Drew, you told us that he would pay us our money.
Yes, of course.
Pay them, Professor.
Well, I, uh...
I don't like their attitude, Allen.
I never heard of people doing business this way.
- Why argue? Pay them and get it over.
- Uhh...
Yes, well, the truth is,
I flnd myself a little short.
Short? How much?
Well, it's around $800.
That's all the money I gave you.
- It wasn't my fault. I was cheated.
- That's all the money I had!
I was stupid enough to trust a scoundrel like you. You blundering old fool!
The professor said that you'd pay us.
Now, what about it?
I'm sorry, but you heard what he said.
You're going to pay me. Nobody's going to put anything over on Emery T. Hawkins.
And you're not through with me either.
That's what I get for giving credit to a bluffing upstart.
- Let's haul this stuff out.
- I'm gonna send a wagon for my stuff.
Take it out and put it on the truck.
Well, I guess that ends everything.
I didn't mean to do it, Dimples.
- Do you see?
- You broke your promise to me.
But the man swore to me.
He gave me his word.
You told me you wouldn't steal anymore.
But what I really meant...
I mean, I-I-I...
I didn't buy the watch for myself. I-I...
You said you were going to be honest.
Uhh. Well, I guess I'm not much good.
Maybe you'd be better off without me.
- But I thought you had money, Allen.
- I did have... enough, anyway.
I guess I didn't take care of it very well.
Well, uh, what are you going to do now?
I suppose I can get a job somewhere... and maybe save up enough money to do the show.
That needn't change our plans about marriage any, Cleo.
I don't suppose money is very important to people who are really in love.
You can say that because you've always had money.
- Perhaps.
- I'm afraid this changes everything.
Then you're not really in love with me.
Oh, you mustn't say that, darling.
I'll run along. Good-bye, Allen.
Good-bye.
I'm awfully sorry, Allen.
Look here, Drew.
It's all right for the rest.
They can take their things back and sell them.
These costumes have been made to fit your play.
They're not worth a penny to anybody else.
How am I going to get my money out of them?
- Sorry, but there's nothing I can do.
- We'll see about that!
Somebody's going to jail for this!
Mrs. Drew, do you still think I'm worth $5,000?
You're worth ever so much more, darling.
And do you still want me to come and live with you?
I can't think of anything I'd like more.
All right, I'll come.
Have you got the $5,000 with you?
I'll be right out!
It won't take me more than a minute.
So you're really going.
Yes, Professor.
Well, I knew it was the best thing for you, but I-I didn't think you'd want to go.
Well, it's like Mrs. Drew said,
"A little girl shouldn't be raised in this kind of'envinoment."'
Yes, you'll... be much better off... in that nice, big house.
Of course, it'll be lonely.
There'll be no children to play with.
But I gotta think of the future,
Professor. That's what Mrs. Drew says.
Yes, and she's right.
And she'll see that you get the right kind of food too.
Plenty of carrots... maybe three or four times a day.
Of course, you won't be able to go fishing with me anymore.
But I guess it's the best thing.
Fishing isn't any too good for little girls.
I like fishing fine.
But I guess it isn't good for little girls.
No, I... I guess it isn't.
Come in.
- Well, I think I'll be going.
- A note from Miss Drew, sir.
- Are you ready, miss?
- I'm ready.
- Ahh...
- Good-bye, Professor.
Good-bye, my little angel.
You'll come and see me sometimes, won't you?
Of course I will.
And you're gonna take good care of yourself like you said you would?
I will.
And you'll... be good too?
Uh, yeah.
Mr. Professor, there's a man without a policeman, Mr. Hawkins, to see you.
- I'm not here. Tell him I'm not here.
- Yes, sir.
- Mr. Hawkins, he's gone...
- Not here, eh?
Listen, Appleby, I've come here to give you one more chance... to pay for those costumes.
If you don't,
I'll have you in jail in an hour.
I...
You'll have your money tonight.
I might've known you'd try that.
I should've sent the law.
I made a mistake coming here myself.
You certainly did,
Mr. Hawkins, and if you don't get out,
I'll be tempted to pull off one of your arms and beat your head in with it!
Professor, I didn't know he was gonna start nothin'!
The professor used to dance and sing for me after dinner.
But, of course, the dinners weren't good for me.
Last night we had wieners... four a piece!
Can you do birdcalls?
Professor Appleby to see you, Mrs. Drew.
- Oh, yes. Come right in, Professor.
- Oh, ho.
- I see you got my note.
- Yes, thank you.
I, uh... I guess it's better for everyone concerned.
Dimples will be happy, and my debts will be paid.
And as for me, I...
I guess I ought to be glad to know that Dimples has such a fine home.
You won't be sorry for this, Professor.
I wonder if I might see Dimples for a minute, just to say good-bye.
Oh, yes, of course. Rufus, take Professor Appleby to Dimples' room.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Ah, thank you.
Why, my darling.
Oh, Professor!
Oh! Why, what's wrong with my little girl? Aren't you happy here?
Oh, yes, yes, I'm very happy.
I hurt my finger.
Where? Are you sure?
Of course.
There. That's better, isn't it?
There we are.
And you can see this lovely dress Mrs. Drew got me.
Yes, it's beautiful.
Must've cost a lot of money, huh?
And she's gonna buy me some dolls too... three of them.
Ah, you're a very lucky little girl, and I'm happy to know that you've got such a nice home.
It isn't every little girl who can have such a good "envinoment."
Oh, my darling.
I'm gonna take you home.
No, Professor. Mrs. Drew says I'm gonna have a lot of advantages here.
Yes, but no place is nice for my little girl when it makes her cry.
You're going home with me.
But if I stay here, you won't have to go to jail.
You can give Allen back his money.
I won't go to jail, sweet.
Mrs. Drew, I... I'm terribly sorry.
It was in a moment of great weakness that I took this money.
- Oh...
- When I saw my little girl crying,
I realized there wasn't enough money in the world to compensate me for that.
You saw her crying? I don't understand.
Don't you like it here?
I do, but I get so lonesome without the professor.
I was willing to give her up, knowing all you could do for her, but I see now that...
Dimples needs me as much as I need her.
Oh! I guess I was foolish to imagine... the child could ever become as fond of me as she is of you.
I admire your honesty and respect you for declining the money.
- Oh, thank you, Mrs. Drew.
- And I thank you too.
You know, I wouldn't go away if the professor could live here too.
Mrs. Drew, why don't you marry the professor?
Why, my dear child...
Then your house wouldn't be so lonesome.
Professor's lots of fun.
I'd marry him if I was grown up.
Course, he hasn't much money, but you've got a lot.
Yes, well, I, uh, think perhaps you'd better run along, darling, and get your things.
- I'll be with you in a minute.
- Good-bye, Mrs. Drew.
Maybe you can come and see us some day.
At our house, you won't have to eat any carrots!
Oh!
Heh, heh!
Well, good-bye, Mrs. Drew, and thank you for all your kindness.
Of course, you realize, Mrs. Drew,
I was only doing this to save our poor little home.
Why, yes, of course.
But thanks to a kindly providence,
I still have means of getting the money.
Of course, it will mean that I'll have to sell my one remaining heirloom, something that's been in the family for generations, but I'll do it.
Oh, that's too bad.
I wouldn't mind so much if I didn't have to sell it at such a great sacrifice.
But it seems a pity that these money-grubbing jewelers... should get the watch for $1,000... when it's easily worth five times that much.
- The watch?
- Yes, yes. Napoleon's watch.
- Oh!
- Eh, Josephine gave it to him, and he gave it to my grandfather at Elba.
Hmm, poor, dear Grandfather.
If he'd ever guessed that I'd have to sell Napoleon's watch... to a money-grubbing jeweler...
- Is that it?
- Yes. Isn't it a beautiful thing?
- Is there anything I could do?
- Oh, no, no, Mrs. Drew.
I couldn't take money from you.
But, uh, perhaps... perhaps you'd let me give it to you.
- Why...
- I'd like you to have it.
You're very kind, but I couldn't take it.
Of course, you could give me the small pittance that the jewelers offered, and someday when fortune smiles on me again I'll buy it back from you.
For Dame Fortune is a fickle gypsy, always blind and often tipsy.
- A thousand dollars?
- Yes, dear lady.
- Oh.
- You'll take care of it, won't you?
- Yes.
- Now I know just how Napoleon felt... when he had to give up this beautiful trinket.
Oh, thank you.
Good night, Mrs. Drew.
Good night.
- What a lovely hand.
- Why, Professor.
- Oh ho! Pardon me. I forgot myself.
- Oh!
I didn't realize my position.
But after all, Mrs. Drew,
I'm only human, and your charms are irresistible.
Good night. Good night.
Uh, 35 cents for one ticket?
Well, opening night prices are a little high, but those are the best seats in the house.
Well, Allen's play opens tonight.
I'm afraid Betty is still fond of Allen.
- I've forbidden her to see him.
- Have you?
Yes, the theater's ruined that young man.
- Can't we speak of something else?
- Hmm? Yes, of course.
Oh, by the way,
I thought you might be interested... in an old emerald ring that I picked up at auction.
Five hundred years old. One of the finest things in my collection.
Mmm. I know so little about these things.
By the way...
I have something I think might interest you... the watch Josephine gave Napoleon.
- Oh! - Professor Appleby had it in his family for many years.
Oh.
Mm-hmm.
Mm.
Well, if that watch belonged to Napoleon, it was given to him
20 years after he died.
- What?
- This thing is tin. An obvious fake.
But I gave the professor a thousand dollars for it.
Then you were robbed.
The watch is worthless.
And after I helped him.
I kept him out of jail. I trusted him.
I believed all the kind things he said.
- The man has made a fool of you.
- He hasn't yet!
I'm going to show him that
I can be just as merciless as he can!
Get your hat, Jasper.
We're going to the police station!
- Can you see her?
- Who, darlin'?
Oh, don't pretend.
I know you're looking for Betty.
I don't see her.
I don't suppose she'll be here.
I'm just a doorman, miss, and orders is orders.
That's all right, Spike.
We're expecting her.
- You're expecting me?
- As if you didn't know!
- Did you flnd her yet?
- No. I didn't think she'd come.
Betty.
I think I'd better go and rehearse my lines.
- This is the nicest surprise I've had.
- I came to wish you good luck.
This is good luck, Betty.
I didn't think you'd ever look at me again after the fool I made of myself.
I'm willing to forget all that, Allen.
But Father never will.
If he knew I'd come here, he'd be in a rage.
Ten minutes!
- Come with me, and I'll get you a seat.
- Ten minutes!
Oh, Topsy, Topsy.
You've been very bad again.
- We want to see Professor Appleby.
- You'll have to wait here.
I'll see if I can find him.
Don't you think all of this can wait until tomorrow, Caroline?
- You know how I loathe this place.
- No! He must be arrested.
It wasn't bad enough that he robbed me of the money.
He also had the insolence to put the money into this foul venture of Allen's.
Mr. Appleby! Mr. Appleby!
- Yes?
- Do you happen to know two policemen?
- Two policemen?
- Yeah, policemen.
- What...
- They're lookin' for you.
Oh...
Yes, I know 'em!
I do like you, Topsy.
I like you because you've never had any father or mother.
I like you, and I want you to be good.
I want you to be good for my sake.
Lord, missy!
I'd be ashamed to be good!
Oh, Topsy, Topsy. I'm sorry for you.
Have you kids seen a suspicious-looking character around here?
I beg your pardon!
Dimples!
Hey, you! What are you duckin' in and out of the place for?
Are you tryin' to hide?
- Who, me?
- Yes, you!
Why, I was sitting there tending to my own business.
If you don't mind, I'll go back to attending to my business.
Uncle Tom on stage.
On stage, Uncle Tom.
- On stage, Uncle Tom.
- Hey!
- I thought you said you were Uncle Tom.
- Yes, you're quite right.
- I am Uncle Tom.
- You're supposed to be on the stage.
Uhh, on the st...
Uh, yes, I am. Thank you very much for calling my attention to it.
I, uh... Heh heh! I was going to make my entrance through the exit.
Stupid of me, wasn't it?
On stage, Uncle Tom.
Oh, Uncle Tom! Uncle Tom!
- Eh!
- Oh, Uncle Tom! Uncle Tom!
Aha! Here I is, Miss Eva.
Well, here I is, Miss Eva.
Professor! Get off! Get off!
- Eh, well, good-bye!
- Bye!
- You're under arrest!
- Oh, but I is Uncle Tom.
You're Uncle Tom? You're Professor
Appleby! I knew all the time!
- Oh, no, I'm playin' in the show here.
- No!
- Will you come with me, Uncle Tom?
- Yes, Miss Eva.
My only duty is to tend to you.
- What's the matter?
- Everything's all right, darling.
I... I just want to talk for a few minutes with these gentlemen.
Never mind that. He's under arrest for stealing a thousand dollars.
- He stole...
- But I didn't take it for myself.
- I wanted to pay Allen back. Really.
- Oh, come on!
You leave him alone!
He didn't steal anything from you!
I'm sorry, darling, but you'll be better off this way.
There isn't much time, Dimples.
You'd better hurry for the last act.
- I'm going to jail with the professor.
- Please, Aunt Caroline.
- This is my affair, Allen.
- It's painful, but it has to be done.
The man is a thief.
No, darling.
You've gotta stay and finish the play.
I can't do it, Professor. I can't.
- I can't!
- Now, listen.
No Appleby ever quit a show.
We've always been troupers.
When you get to be a little older, you'll know what that means.
You've got big scenes to play, darling, and I want you to play 'em just as though you thought...
I was out here to watch.
She'll stay. Won't you, pumpkins?
If... If you want me to, Professor.
That's right. And you'll give a good performance too, won't you?
I'll try.
That's my little girl.
I'm proud of you.
And I'm proud of you too.
Well, I... I'm ready to go now.
Oh
Swing low, sweet chariot
Kindly sit down in this box until the scene is over.
Young man, are you suggesting that we witness this foul exhibition?
- We will not sit down!
- The show is on. Sit and stop talking.
- I will not!
- We are not degenerates!
Officer, can't you make these people understand? They'll disrupt the show.
Very well, Jasper. Let's not make a scene. It'll only last a minute.
Comin'for to carry me home, oh
Swing low, sweet chariot
- Betty's here! Shh!
- Comin'for to carry me home
Well, you're looking much better, dear.
In a day or two, you're going to be as strong as a lion.
No, Papa.
You needn't pretend, because I know.
You know what, dear?
That I'm going away, and very soon.
Oh, my baby, you mustn't think those things.
I wouldn't be surprised if you were out of bed by tomorrow, playing with Topsy.
No, Father.
The angels told me.
They told me last night... when my head hurt so.
They're going to take me to Heaven.
Now, you'll feel more cheerful when you've had a nap.
I am cheerful, Papa, because Heaven is beautiful.
But... But I'll miss you.
You're not going to leave me, my pet... not for a long, long time.
And there's something else that makes me sad.
Can't something be done for Uncle Tom and his people?
What do you mean, dear?
They love their children as much as you love me.
Uncle Tom loves his children.
- Please do something for them.
- Anything I can, dear.
Eva?
You'll give Uncle Tom his freedom, won't you, Papa?
I will, dear. I will.
Eva? Eva?
I can see those great gates.
They're made of pearls!
And they're opening wide.
And there are angels.
They're calling for me.
I'm coming.
I'm... coming.
Eva! Eva!
She doesn't hear.
It's over. Praise the Lord, massah.
It's over.
Oh, swing low
Sweet chariot
Comin'for to carry me home
Oh, swing low
Sweet chariot
Comin'for to carry me home
- Bravo! Bravo!
- Bravo!
Well, I guess we better go now.
Yes, I guess so.
Obviously you haven't a heart.
Who'd think of taking that lovely child away from her grandfather... after he helped Allen produce this beautiful play?
Well, I thought you said the theater was a bad influence.
I'll thank you not to interfere with my affairs! Let him go.
Oh, thank you, Mrs. Drew.
You're a woman of great character and discrimination.
May I?
Wait! Don't go!
We have a treat for you tonight.
The entire company, headed by our charming little star,
has prepared a celebration for the first anniversary of Uncle Tom's Cabin.
Out of the South has recently come a new form of entertainment.
Our company wishes to be the first to present it in New York, if it is your pleasure.
The Louisiana moon is shining down from starry skies
Above, mm-mm
The lonesome lonely old and breaking heart
Just needs a lady love, mm-mm
While the shades of night were falling, falling
You could hear him softly calling
Dixie-Anna, oh, Miss Dixie-Anna
Don't keep me waitin'
Ain't you gonna come out tonight
Full moon shinin' and my heart a-pinin'
Come out and meet me in the moonlight
Can't you understand
Love is in the air
Lovers hand in hand strolling everywhere
Dixie-Anna, oh, Miss Dixie-Anna
Don't keep me waitin'
Ain't you gonna come out tonight
Glowin' and shinin' and my heart a-pinin'
Come out and meet me in the moonlight
Dixie-Anna, oh, Miss Dixie-Anna
Don't keep me waitin'

Dixie-Anna, oh, Miss Dixie-Anna
Don't keep me waitin'
Ain't you gonna come out tonight
Moon a-shinin' and my heart a-pinin'

Mr. Bowes, why is it a fireman wears red suspenders?
Well, I'll tell ya, I don't know.
Say, how come a fireman wear red suspenders?
Well, the reason a fireman wears red suspenders?
To keep his pants up. I don't know.
Full moon shinin' and my heart a-pinin'
Come out and meet me in the moonlight
Oh, Dixie-Anna don't you keep me waitin'
You know that ain't right
Dixie-Anna, oh, Miss Dixie-Anna
Don't keep me waitin'
Ain't you gonna come out tonight
Moon a-shinin' and my heart a-pinin'
Come out and meet me in the moonlight
Can't you understand
Love is in the air
Lovers hand in hand strolling everywhere
Dixie-Anna, oh, Miss Dixie-Anna
Don't keep me waitin'
Ain't you gonna come out tonight
Moon a-shinin' and my heart a-pinin'
Come out and meet me in the moonlight
# Oh, the days are gone #
#When beauty bright #
# My heart's chain wove #
#When my dream of life #
# From morn till night #
#Was love, still love #
# New hope may bloom #
#And days may come #
# Of milder, calmer beam #
But there's nothing half
so sweet in life
As love's young dream
# Oh, there's nothing #
# Half so sweet in life #
#As love's young dream ##
Oh, that was delightful, indeed.
- Delightful.
- That was lovely, Elizabeth.
Thank you, Dr. Scott.
Colonel, if I were 20 years younger,
I'd carry her off.
I suspect some other people have the same idea.
Father, you shouldn't say such things.
- Oh, I know I shouldn't, my dear.
- I've missed a lot.
Marriage is a wonderful institution.
- Yes. No family should be without it.
- Oh!
[Chuckling Continues]
Thank you.
Oh! Confound you, Walker!
Watch what you're doing!
- I'm sorry, sir.
- You'd better be.
If you'd broken that,
I'd have broken your head.
Yes, sir.
It's pretty, isn't it? Valuable too.
Yes, someday your temper's going to split you wide open.
Well, sir, when it does,
I won't send for you to sew me up.
[Dr. Scott]
That's a good one.
But it's too late for you to change
your family physician now, Colonel.
Oh, I don't know, Doctor.
This is an age of change.
Colonel, a toast before we say good night.
- [All Agreeing]
- Yes, Colonel, a toast.
I give you our homeland- glorious in defeat... gallant in victory... and brave in her hour of grief.
Gentlemen, I give you the South... and confusion to all her enemies.
Hear! Hear! Right, right.
[Man]
A very lovely evening, Colonel.
Oh, my dear boy, it's a pleasure, always.
Oh, my dear friends, don't run away like this.
The evening's young.
Hurry, Becky.
Oh, Miss Elizabeth,
I hate to see you go... and I'm afraid of what the colonel will do when he finds out.
He won't find out till I'm well on my way.
Now, stop crying and don't act suspiciously.
- I'll send for you as soon as I can.
- Yes'm.
[Footsteps In Gravel]
Put up your hands!
Don't try to run, or I'll shoot.
Come here.
- Take my bag down the back way.
- Yes'm.
Now, who are you... and what are you doing prowling around my place at night?
- My name is Jack Sherman, sir.
- Sherman, huh?
Well, that name's no recommendation.
You're a Yankee too, huh?
Well, out with it.
What are you doing here?
Wait, Jack! Let me tell him.
Father, this is the man
I'm going to marry.
I knew you would never give your consent, so we were going to elope.
- I wanted to come to you, sir, and ask you if you'd-
- Silence!
Why did you assume I would object to an honorable marriage?
I know how you feel about the North.
- I hate all Yankees.
- That's why we didn't come and tell you.
Then you knew you were doing wrong.
I love him.
How can you love a man who represents what every true Southerner should hate?
A man who probably fought against your father... your brother and all your kinfolk.
Why, for all you know... he may be the very man who fired the shot... that killed your brother.
I was a soldier just as you were, sir... and even though I fought on the other side, the South has my respect and sympathy.
My mother was a Virginian.
But may I remind you, the war has been over for a long time.
The war will never be over for me or mine, sir.
You know, I ought to kill you.
I don't know but what I will.
Elizabeth, go to your room.
- No.
- Go to your room, I tell you.
I'm going with Jack.
Elizabeth!
When that door closes... it'll never open for you again.
- Assemble the men for orders of the day.
- Yes, sir.
Sound assembly.
## [Call To Assembly]
[Bugle Continues]
Attention!
- Troop is formed, sir.
- Take your post.
General Weatherby has this day appointed to his staff... as honorary colonel, Lloyd Sherman.
Draw sabers!
Eyes right!
[Drumming Continues]
Eyes front! Present sabers!
This honor has been conferred on you for distinguished services.
Completely unarmed...
except for your golden curls,
brown eyes and your dimples...
you've captured
an entire regiment- this one.
I take great pleasure in handing you your commission, Colonel Sherman.
I can't read this writing.
It isn't big enough.
Besides, I can't read anyway.
Oh, I assure you, it's all according to military regulations.
Now that I'm a colonel, can't I play with the boys anymore?
- Of course you can.
- Well, you don't.
Uh-
[Clears Throat]
Do colonels have to go to bed at 7:00?
Why, no. Sometimes colonels stay up as late as 8:00.
- I wish you'd tell my mother that.
- I will.
Now I'll show that I'm a real colonel.
[Clears Throat]
[Chuckling]
Attention, men.
Company dismissed!
Company dismissed!
You heard the colonel's order.
[Chuckles] Well, Colonel, how does it feel to be in command of a big army like this?
Thank you.
We feel just as proud as she does.
Bob, I want to thank you for everything.
It's been a great pleasure to have you and your family with us even for so short a time.
- Quite different from Philadelphia, isn't it?
- Yes, indeed.
We lived there for six years, but I never got used to the noise of the horse cars.
- [Chuckling]
- I understood from Jack you had sold your home there.
We sold everything- lock, stock and barrel.
Took Greeley's advice to go West, and here we are to find our fortune.
Depending on your help for that.
Oh, there's plenty there for the finding, if we're lucky.
Attention, men!
Present arms!
[Giggling]
I do wish I didn't have to go back home to Lloydsboro.
Now, dear, we've settled all that.
This country's no place for women and children... and whereJack's going it's even rougher.
The colonel is right, ma'am.
Jack told me you have a lovely home waiting for you.
That sounds too grand.
It's just a cottage my mother left me.
No one's lived in it for years.
- A safe journey to you and an uneventful one.
- Thank you.
Now, you gotta watch very close.
Well, having a fine time for yourself, aren't you?
What's the matter?
Has the cat got your tongue?
- You hurt. Put me down!
- Oh, I wouldn't hurt you, little lady.
Give me a kiss, hmm?
- You'll write often, won't you, dear?
- Of course.
- The coach is here, Mr. Sherman.
- Thank you.
- Remember what I told you, little Colonel.
- All right.
Kiss me good-bye.
Good-bye, darling. Home safe.
- Do be careful.
- I will.
Now, honey, you be a brave soldier and look out for Mother, won't you?
Yes, Papa Jack. I will.
- Good-bye, my baby.
- Good-bye.
- Good morning, Colonel, sir.
- [Grunts]
- Fair and bright today.
- Mm-hmm.
I hear down at the village prices is picking up... and it's a big year for cotton.
- Oh, stop chattering, Walker!
- Yes, sir.
- I don't want to hear all this gossip.
- No, sir.
I was gonna tell you about the cottage, sir... but I reckon you wouldn't be interested.
- Cottage?
- Yes, sir. Someone is moving in to it.
- Walker!
- Yes, sir?
Confound you! Why don't you let me know what's going on around here?
- Who's moving in to the cottage?
- I don't know, sir.
I hear tell they moved in this morning.
Well, well, well, well.
It's been empty a long time now.
Ever since-
Well, maybe I'd better call on our new neighbors... and see what kind of folks they are.
Yes, sir. Having neighbors won't make it so lonely around here.
- Who says it's lonely around here?
- Not me. No, sir.
Anyway, I like to be lonely.
Why, F-
Mother, who was that?
- Your grandfather.
- Why didn't he come in?
He didn't want to.
Did he make you cry?
Never mind, dear.
You're a bad man to make my mama cry!
- Mom Beck.
- What, child?
Why doesn't my grandfather want to come in and see my mother?
Well, he mighty mad at she, and, I guess, she mad at he.
Why?
Your grandfather get mad when your mother married your daddy.
- But he's her papa, isn't he?
- Sure enough.
- Shouldn't papas love their little girls?
- Yes, they should.
Seems mighty funny to me.
Well, it's 'cause all the Lloyds are stubborn.
The old colonel is, your mother is, and you is.
I'm not stubborn!
Don't you call me that!
No use you stomping your foot at me.
That don't change it.
That just proves it.
Now, lookee here, honey, does you want to fight with me, or does you want to help me?
I want to help you.
That's fine.
Mom Beck, I'm expecting Aunt Sally Tyler for lunch. Will you have enough?
I don't know if I can stretch one small chicken... but as long as the water's running, we'll have soup enough.
- Well, do the best you can.
- Yes'm.
Honey, don't eat that now.
You'll spoil your lunch.
Is Aunt Sally Tyler my aunt too?
- She's your great aunt, dear.
- My great aunt?
Oh, I know. The big, fat one.
You must be very polite to her, dear.
She's coming all the way from Louisville to see us.
All right, Mother. I will.
Mom Beck?
Will you tell me a pink story?
If you ain't the beatenest child
I ever see.
When you wanna hear a blue story, everything in it has got to be blue.
And when you wants to hear a green story, everything in it has got to be green.
Now, I could tell you a black story about my first husband.
[Chuckling] You better run out and play with May Lily.
All right.
And don't let me see you take none of them cookies.
It's a good thing I didn't see you take 'em.
[Laughing]
It's a good thing I didn't see you take 'em.
[Laughing]
And I only had one shot left.
I aimed my gun- Bang!
I killed those three Indians.
Why, Miss Lloyd, did you really do that?
Of course not.
That's just a story.
And you don't have to call me Miss Lloyd.
You can call me Colonel.
- Are you a colonel too?
- Yes, I am. A real colonel.
- You can't be no colonel.
- Why not?
Because you ain't got no whiskers.
I don't need to have whiskers.
I've got a temper.
That's all you need to be a colonel.
I guess that's right, 'cause all the colonels
I ever see had tempers.
I hope you're not a colonel like him in there.
If you was, I'd be "afeared" to play with you.
Miss Lloyd, them's the colonel's flowers!
Well, we're not afraid of the colonel.
Who ain't afraid?
Maybe you ain't, but I is.
Now, listen, May Lily, and you too, Henry Clay.
I'm the colonel, and you're my men... and in the army, you have to obey orders.
- Uh-huh.
- Forward march!
I don't think I'm gonna like being in the army.
Aw!
They're so beautiful.
My mother'll love these.
Here, Henry Clay. You carry them.
- Follow me, men.
- Follow me, men.
Come on, May Lily.
Let's make mud pies.
Get a lot of nice, round pebbles, and they can be raisins.
We'll put dust over the top, and that can be sugar.
We'll just make the finest mud pies you ever saw.
Who's been picking these flowers?
Colonel, your army is retreatin' right now!
Come on, Henry!
Hey, what's going on around here?
Don't you dare poke me with that old stick!
What's that? You'd better learn some respect for your elders.
I won't respect anyone who pokes me.
For a little girl, you've got a bad temper.
That's your fault.
What's that? Who are you?
They call me "the little colonel."
What, under the sun, do they call you that for?
Because I'm so much like you.
Like me? How are you like me?
Because I've got such a temper... and I stamp my foot when I get mad.
I get all red in the face, and I holler back at people too. [Angry Sputtering]
Look at you.
You're a pretty sight.
What are you running around the country for, like poor, white trash?
I don't know who your mother is... but whoever she is, she oughta teach you better.
Don't you dare say anything about my mother!
[Angry Shout]
Whose child is that?
How can I tell you, sir, when you don't want nobody to even say her name?
I'm Lloyd Sherman.
That's who I am.
Lloyd Sherman?
- Lloyd-
- Come, honey.
Your mama's mighty worried about you.
Well, I'm sorry. I didn't know.
- Oh, that's all right. Good-bye, Grandfather.
- Good-bye.
What are you all standing around gaping for?
Go on! Move!
Get out of here!
Get out of here!
"We are pushing on further, and I have every reason to believe... something very good will come of it."
Then he writes some personal things.
Can that be Lloyd that Becky is carrying?
Hello, Mother.
- How do you do, Aunt Sally Tyler?
- How do you do?
- Where have you been?
- I've been to see my grandfather.
I threw mud on him.
- You threw mud on him?
- Yes.
Because he poked me with a stick.
Then I got mad, and he got mad, and we hollered at each other.
Oh, baby, how could you disgrace Mother
going there looking like a dirty beggar?
I didn't beg him for anything.
You've been a naughty girl, and you're going to be punished.
Take her in the house, Becky.
Give her a bath and put her to bed.
Yes'm.
I'm terribly upset.
I wouldn't, for worlds, have him think
I encouraged her in going there.
Yes, I know, but just the same... there are some things to be considered besides your pride, Elizabeth.
There's the child herself.
You ought to think of her interests.
I don't care.
I don't want anything from him.
I know, dear, but just the same,
I say you ought to think of Lloyd.
If I were you, I'd let her go over there as often as she pleases.
Who knows? It might end in your all making up some day.
Never. Not after the terrible things he said aboutJack.
# Swing low #
# Sweet chariot #
# Coming for to carry me home ##
My, my. You look just like an angel out of heaven.
To look at you now, no one would ever believe... that you can be a regular little demon.
Now, look here, honey, if you don't take your nap like a good little girl...
Mom Beck won't bring you along with her to the baptizing.
- Will there be singing?
- Sure will. And wailing too.
- Then I'll take my nap.
- That's a good little girl.
# Mmm, carry me #
# Home ##
- Howdy, Mr. Sherman.
- How are you?
I saw your friends, Swazey and Hull, out on the trail very early this morning.
Yes, they're out looking over some of their properties.
- Well, luck to you.
- Thanks.
Give me the gold.
Ah, it seems a shame to waste
20 dollars' worth of gold dust.
It ain't wastin' it. You'll see.
Stand back now.
Now, that's what I call a rich piece of ore.
- It'd take you to think of a trick like this.
- It's a sure thing.
It never fails.
Do you hear that?
That's opportunity knocking, but it don't knock but once.
You'll have to make up your mind quick.
Swazey and I want to push on to California.
We just got word of a big strike out there.
We own the land this ore comes from.
The ore speaks for itself. It's rich.
Now, if you make a fast deal, the land's yours.
I know it's a fine opportunity... but the price you ask is just about all I've got in the world.
- It's worth a lot more.
- We want you to have it because you're our friend.
You can't lose. You could sell out tomorrow for more than we're asking.
Let's forget about the whole deal and part friends.
We'll get another buyer, and then we're off to California.
- Wait a minute. I've decided. I'll take it.
- Now you're talkin'.
You get your money, and we'll give you a deed all free and clear.
- Fine.
- You can't go wrong.
[Chuckling]
- [Clears Throat] Good morning, Miss Lloyd.
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Sis Porter.
- Good morning to you, Brother Walker.
Well, well. This is certainly what I call a coincidence.
Yes, I know.
You never expected to see me.
Say, look here.
How is Miss Elizabeth?
Oh, her health is all right, but I think she worries about Mr. Jack.
He better come home pretty soon.
- What you mean? You ain't got no mo-
- [Clearing Throat]
M-O-N-l-E.
Not only that, we's 'most out of F-U-D-E.
Mmm-mmm. That's too bad.
Lookee here.
Wouldn't the K-U-N-E-L... give her a little L-O-N-E?
You know Miss Elizabeth wouldn't take nothing from him.
Why, before she'd do that, she'd go to the, uh, uh...
P-O-H-O-S.
P-O-H-O-S?
Yeah, sure. Ain't you got no education?
The poorhouse.
- Oh, no.
- Yes, indeed.
- Mom Beck?
- What, honey?
- What's a poorhouse?
- That's the place where they send people who got no money.
- Is it nice?
- No, honey. It's a terrible place.
The people there wear rags, and all they gets to eat is corn dodger out of tin pans.
Then I don't want my mother to have to go there.
Why, honey child, your mother won't never have to go to no poorhouse.
- We wouldn't let that happen, would we, Brother Walker?
- I should say not.
Now, don't you worry your pretty little head about things like that.
- The Lord always provides.
- Amen.

Mom Beck, why do they dunk the women in the river that way?
That's to save their souls and wash their sins away.
- Will it wash my sins away?
- Well, honey, you ain't got no sins.
You is a little angel.
Well, would it wash my sins away if I had any?
Yes, honey, if you carried the right thought and believed it would.
Were you ever dunked, Mom Beck?
A little river like that wouldn't do her no good.
- Child, she needs the Mississippi.
- Go on, you no-account!
I'm goin'! I'm goin', Sis Porter!
If the old colonel ever finds out where we got these sheets... he'll baptize us good.
Didn't I tell you that my men don't have to be afraid of anything?
Now, Henry Clay, are you all ready?
- Have you got the right thoughts?
- Uh-huh.
You believe that it'll wash your sins away?
All right then. Come on.
One, two, three.
- # Hallelujah #
- Are you saved?
Well, we'll have to do it again.
One, two, three.
- # Hallelujah #
- Are you saved?
Uh-huh.
What, under the sun's,
going on here?
- What are you doing?
- Hello, Grandfather.
We were just baptizing Henry Clay.
Baptizing Henry Clay?
Yes, and he must be awful bad... because it took two dunks to save him.
- [Laughing Continues]
- [Chuckles, Stops]
Look at you- all wet and mussed up.
When am I going to see you look the way a little girl should look- fresh and dainty as a flower?
Come on with me.
Where are we going?
Up to the house to get your clothes dry.
Grandfather?
Well, what is it?
I'm sorry that I threw mud on you... and I'm sorry that I lost my temper.
[Kisses]
And I'm sorry that I took the sheets off your bed.
What?
You took my sheets?
- I had to have them.
- Oh, you did, did you?
Oh, come on.
- Maria?
- Yes, sir.
Uh, here's a young lady.
Her clothes need drying.
- Yes, sir?
- Well, take her.
But, Colonel, sir, what can I put on her while her clothes is a-dryin'?
I ain't got nothin' for a little girl to wear.
- Mmm. Walker?
- Yes, sir?
Go up in the attic, and you'll find, uh, a small trunk.
There may be some clothes in that that will fit Miss Lloyd.
A little trunk in the attic, sir?
Yes, you numbskull.
Don't you understand English?
- Yes, sir.
- Well, then go on. Attend to it right away.
- [Door Closes]
- Do you know whose trunk that is... and whose clothes they is?
Course I do. You go on now and get them things.
We don't want no men around here.
With that face, you don't have to worry.
Hee-hee!
Go on now!
My, my. You is the spitting image of your mother.
You got the same goldy hair and pinky cheeks.
Did my mother have a temper too?
Yes, indeed, she did.
Did you ever, in all your born days, see anything like that?
It takes me back 20 years.
It's been that long since there was any children in this house.
Now, don't you say anything.
I'm gonna surprise Grandfather.
Where is he?
In the big room, Miss Lloyd.
Looks like this old house ain't gonna be lonesome no more.

That was your grandmother, dear.
And that was her song you just sang.
I know.
My mother teached it to me.
"Teached" isn't right, is it?
No. "Taught" is correct.
"Taught" then.
[Giggling]
What was my grandmother's name?
Her name was Amanthis.
Amanthis?
That's a beautiful name.
Mmm. She was a beautiful woman... and she had a beautiful soul.
I wish she was here now.
Do you, dear? Why?
I know if she was here... she'd go right to my mother and kiss away all of her sorry feelings.
Grandfather, do you know any blue stories?
Blue stories?
- Yes, I do. A few.
- Tell me one.
I don't know any that I can tell you.
Then play a game with me.
What kind of a game?
Well, it couldn't be tag or prisoner's base, could it?
No. No, it couldn't.
It better be a sit-down game.
[Laughs]
I think so.
Do you know how to play jacks?
Jacks? Do you play that with cards?
[Chuckling]
No, with a ball.
Oh, well, then I don't know how to play it. No.
Do you play cribbage?
Cribbage?
Is that like hopscotch?
Oh, no, no. Well, not exactly.
I have it.
I know a fine game for us. Walker!
All right, Walker. That'll do.
Yes, sir.
[Colonel] I reckon you don't know
much about soldiering.
Of course I do. Look.
[Laughs]
You don't even know how to salute.
I do too.
This is a proper salute.
Oh, no, it isn't, Grandfather.
Well, I ought to know.
I was a colonel in the army.
[Chuckles]
So was I.
Aw, stuff and nonsense.
They made me a colonel and gave me a paper with ribbon on it.
- They called it my "permission."
- Who did?
The soldiers out West, where Papa Jack is.
Aw, I never heard such folderol- making a colonel out of a little girl.
Well, it's just another fool Yankee notion.
Anyway, this is the proper salute.
It isn't!
For your years and weight... you're probably the stubbornest person in this county.
[Chuckling]
You weigh a lot more than I do.
Come on. Let's get on with this game now.
Come on. Come on.
Here. These are yours.
Now, I'll be the Confederacy, and you're the Union.
Goody!
I got the winning side already.
No, you haven't. I'll show you.
Maybe you'd like to be the North, and I'll be the South.
[Sighs]
I wish I'd never thought of this confounded game.
Here come my trusty scouts.
They see a Johnny Reb. Bang, bang!
Now eight of my men attack the enemy's right flank. Up!
- You can't do that!
- Why not?
Because my men will fall back on the right flank.
Then they'll let your men advance.
Then they'll surround them... cutting off all retreat.
And then I'll wipe 'em out.
And then I'll order my men to advance... and I'll wipe out your whole regiment.
Child, you're a true Lloyd.
You've got all the fire and courage... our family has always had... and you've got the same infernal temper that's been our curse.
It's going to cause you a lot of unhappiness... unless you learn how to control it.
Will you try?
I will if you will.
[Laughs]
Ah, you've got a lot more time to learn than I have.
Well, come on now.
Your clothes must be dry by now.
I'll have Maggie Boy saddled... and ride you home.
- Would you like that?
- Oh, yes, Grandfather.
Well, come along.
Hello, May Lily.
Miss Lloyd, is you all right?
Of course I am.
Couldn't we please take May Lily and Henry Clay home too?
Impossible.
I could hold onto the rope, and we could pull them.
No.
- Please, Grandfather.
- [Chuckles]
Oh, very well then.
Come on, you pickaninnies.
Fall in the rear.
[Shouts]
Here, throw me that rope.
[Shouting]
[Laughing]
- Good afternoon, Colonel.
- Good afternoon, sir.
[Both Laughing]
You're going to come and see me again, aren't you?
Even though they tell you not to?
Yes, Grandfather.
And the next time we play, we won't quarrel.
[Chuckles]
No. Come along now. Get along with you.
That's it.
- Why don't you come with me?
- No, no, no, no. No.
- All right. Good-bye, Grandfather.
- Good-bye.
You can gamble it's important.
Folks don't spend money for telegrams unless they got something to say.
- What do you reckon it says, Mr. Nebler?
- Ain't allowed to tell.
- It's against the rules.
- Pretty expensive to send them, ain't it?
Well, telegrams ain't for poor folks.
Sendin' writin' over wires.
[Clicking Tongue]
I wonder what they'll have next.
[Knocking]
- Is Mrs. Sherman in?
- Yes, sir. Come in.
I've got a telegram for you,
Mrs. Sherman.
Sign here, ma'am.
I'm sure it's bad news. It must be.
Oh, dear. Here, Mom Beck.
You open it.
No, ma'am. Not me.
I don't want nothin' to do with it.
- Will you open it for me?
- Against the rules, ma'am.
He's coming home!
He's coming home, Mom Beck!
Papa Jack's coming home!
It's from my husband. He's on his way back.
Thank you very, very much.
- It's all right, ma'am. Any answer?
- No.
Oh, it's so wonderful! Good-bye.
[Mr. Nebler]
Good-bye.
Sit up, Fritz. Sit up.
- When will Papa Jack be here, Mother?
- Soon, darling.
And he'll bring us beautiful gold pieces to buy beautiful presents.
And can I have a pink dress with pink ribbons and a pink bustle?
Of course you can.
We'll just have everything we want.
- Oh, I'm so happy!
- # Hallelujah #
# O praise be #
- # Mr. Jack's a-comin' home #
- [Fritz Barking]
- Hallelujah
- [Barking Continues]
O praise be
Mr. Jack's a-comin'home
Jack! Oh, Jack!
Why, what's the matter?
Please help me.
What is it, Jack? What's wrong?
I've been very sick. Fever.
I'm not over it yet.
You'd better not come near me.
Please go to Dr. Scott's and ask him to come here at once.
Yes, ma'am.
Please, Elizabeth, don't come near me.
I don't want you to catch this fever.
I won't.
And if I did, I wouldn't care.
My poor boy.
Papa Jack! Papa Jack!
- Wait a minute, darling.
- Hello, my baby.
- Mother, let me go.
- Listen a minute, dear.
- Papa Jack is ill, and just for now, you can't go near him.
- But why?
Because if you did, you might catch his illness, and then you'd be sick too.
- That's right, dear.
- Becky?
Can't I even give him just one little kiss?
No, darling.
You go with Becky.
Now, tell me, dear.
What happened?
Swazey and Hull were thieves.
The land they sold me was worthless.
We're ruined. We haven't a penny.
Jack, is all our money gone?
All of it.
After I found out that I'd been swindled,
I almost went crazy.
And then on top of it,
I got this fever, and-
Hush, dear.
Don't think of it now.
You must be quiet.
Poor Elizabeth.
You made a sorry bargain when you gave up your beautiful home.
I'd do it again.
[Knocking]
- Oh, Doctor.
- Yes.
I never thought I was going to get a call from this house.
What's the matter?
Did Lloyd fall down and bump her nose?
No, it's Jack.
Jack? Oh.
- Mom Beck, do you know what I think?
- What, honey?
I think that those two bad men gave the sickness to Papa Jack.
Oh, I don't think so.
Yes, they did, just to get rid of it themselves.
[Laughing]
Honey, you is a case.
I reckon bed will be the best place for you, young man.
- How much fever have I?
- Oh, nothing to worry about.
We'll have you up and around in no time.
I'll run along now... and I'll bring ya some medicine from my office.
- Good-bye, Mr. Sherman.
- Good-bye, Doctor.
Yes.
He's in a very weakened condition... and he's still running quite a temperature.
He needs very careful nursing and plenty of it.
Mom Beck and I will take care of him.
There's still a chance that his fever may be contagious.
- That won't matter to me.
- No, but if I were you,
I'd send Lloyd away for awhile.
You shouldn't take any chances with her.
But where can I send her?
There's only one place, Elizabeth... and you mustn't be stubborn about it.
He's all alone in that big house, you know... and he'd see that she was properly cared for.
She's never been away from me one night in her whole life.
I know, but this house is no place for her right now.
I'd send her if I were you.
Let me speak with him, and I'll arrange it.
- Very well.
- I'll be back this evening.
[Choir Singing]
Mother, do I have to stay here very long?
No, dear.
Just until Papa Jack is well.
'Cause I'm gonna be awfully lonesome.
You're going to be brave, aren't you?
You promised you would.
Yes, but when I promised,
I didn't know I was gonna feel this way.
Kiss Mother good-bye now.

You know I can't stand noise.
- Take that infernal dog and put him out.
- Yes, sir.
- Walker.
- Yes, sir?
Uh, take Miss Lloyd to her room and have Maria put her to bed.
Yes, sir.
Good night, dear.
Good night, Grandfather.
What are you wearing those old clothes for?
Why don't they dress you up when you go visiting?
It isn't showing proper respect to send you off... in the oldest things you have.
They're the best I've got, and I like them.
And anyway,
I don't need any new ones... because pretty soon we'll be going away.
Going away? Where?
To the poorhouse.
Now, now, Miss Lloyd, where you goin'?
I'm going home to my mother.
She loves me, even if my clothes are old and ugly.
Why, the colonel loves you too,
Miss Lloyd.
It's just because his rheumatism is botherin' him that he's so cranky.
My, my! You should hear the things he says to me.
They would just curl your hair.
Would they really curl my hair?
Would they?
You can see what they did to mine.
I don't wanna go up there.
Why, everybody's got to go upstairs,
Miss Lloyd, if they wants to go to bed.
I don't want to.
Look here.
Will you go if I show you a brand-new way how to go up stairs?
How could there be a new way to go up stairs?
Now, you just watch.

I like to go up stairs that way.
You sure learn fast.
Now, tomorrow,
I'll show you some more steps.
- Good night, Miss Lloyd.
- Good night.
- Pleasant dreams.
- Now, honey, we gonna go to bed.
Fritz, hup. Hup.
Now, you be quiet for a spell until the coast is clear... then I'll take you upstairs.
The little lady up there might be powerful glad to see you.
I want my mother.
- Is that you, Walker?
- Yes, sir.
What in blazes are you prowling around for?
Why, Colonel, sir,
I thought maybe you might like... one of them special hot toddies before you go to sleep.
Well, that's a good idea.
- Fetch it.
- Yes, sir.
[Fritz Whimpering]
What's that?
Me, sir.
I kind of got a misery in my throat.
[Clearing Throat]
Well, do something about that.
Yes, sir.
[Door Closes]
Oh, Fritzy, I'm so glad to see ya.
Now I can go to sleep.
Go to sleep now.
[Colonel]
Walker!
I don't know how that dog got in there, sir. Honest, I don't.
- Ah, he probably crawled up the chimney.
- Yes, sir.
Well, never mind about that.
I want you to go to town on Saturday... and buy a lot of little girls' clothes.
- What shall I buy, sir?
- Well, what do you suppose?
Hats, shoes... stockings, dresses... and whatever goes under the dresses.
- Yes, sir.
- And, Walker?
Yes, sir?
- I'm an old fool.
- Yes, sir!
And that's the end of the story.
It would be nice if life were more like books.
Then when a couple married, their troubles would be over instead of... just beginning.
The only trouble we have is your illness.
And the sooner you stop fretting, the sooner we'll be rid of that.
[Knocking]
How do you do?
Is Mr. Jack Sherman at home?
- Yes, he is. Won't you come in?
- Thank you.
How do you do, Mr. Sherman?
My name is Jeremy Higgins.
- I represent the Union Pacific Railroad.
- I'm honored, sir.
- Thank you. Thank you.
- How can I serve you?
Well, sir,
"short and sweet" is my motto... and I'll state my business just as briefly as possible... and then all you need to tell me is yes or no.
What is it you want?
I want a right-of-way through your Western property.
- I don't understand.
- It's very simple.
Our engineers were going to tunnel through a mountain... but if we have the right-of-way across your property, that won't be necessary.
- Well, l-
- Now, now, we know exactly what you paid for it... and we'll give you $5,000 for your right-of-way.
But frankly, sir, we will not stand for a squeeze. No, sir.
Now, remember, all you have to do is give us the right-of-way... and you'll retain all the rest of your property.
- Well, will you deal?
- I'm knocked off my pins.
Now, now, my dear sir,
I am a man of very few words.
- All I want from you is yes or no.
- It's yes, of course!
Good. Good. I'll have the necessary papers drawn up- all except the legal description of the property... which, of course,
I can get from your deed.
- You have your deed, of course?
- Yes, it's at my bank.
You have it here tonight, and I'll have a check for you.
That's the way the Union Pacific does business.
Good day. Good day.
[Elizabeth]
Oh, my darling!
This is more cure than all the medicine.
I'm well again.
Oh, no, you're not.
Now, you just be quiet.
The best part of it is that now we won't have to ask your father for anything.
And he can't laugh at me for being a failure.
Now, look, Elizabeth, you must go to the bank.
I'll give you a note to Mr. Jennings, and get all the papers I left there.
- The deed is with them.
- Yes, dear, I will.
Oh, it's almost too good to be true!
Miss Lloyd, there's only one word for the way you look in your new clothes...
- and that is "scrumptious."
- [Laughing]
- Sure is a-quality.
- Uh-huh.
- [Laughing]
- Are you gonna show me some new steps today?
Not today, Miss Lloyd.
You see, I gotta drive to town.

Hello in there.
Well, bless my buttons.
If it isn't the little colonel.
Why, good day, young lady.
How does your "copperossity" seem to "sagashuate," hmm?
What's the matter?
Has the cat still got your tongue?
You ought to be glad to see us.
We're old friends of yours, and we've come a long way to see your daddy.
- Where is he?
- He's home, and he's sick.
Oh. Sick, is he? That's too bad.
Uh, where's home?
It's down at the end of the road.
Thanks, Colonel.
You're still a colonel, I suppose?
Good-bye.
Those are bad men.
I heard Papa Jack say so.
- [Knocking]
- Come in.
- Why, Jack, old partner.
- What's wrong, Jack?
- What's happened to you?
- I've been very ill.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear it.
Anything I can do?
No, thank you.
Maybe when you find out why we're here, you'll feel better.
When we sold you that land, we did it in good faith.
- Didn't we, Hull?
- That's right.
We thought there was gold, and plenty on it, then we went on to California.
On our way back, we stopped off to see how you were faring... and we found out what had happened.
Partner, we felt bad about it, didn't we?
- That's right.
- Go on.
Now we'll prove we're honest.
We made this long trip to find you to give you back your money.
Oh, you did, did you?
Yes, sir, every penny of it.
Why, I couldn't sleep again if I thought you'd lost money on account of me.
All you have to do is to hand over the deed to the property... and we'll pay you what you paid us.
You're very kind and generous.
No, we're- we're only being fair.
- And now, be kind enough to leave my house.
- Partner!
You found out my land is valuable, and the railroad wants it... and I found out what kind of men you are.
- Get out of here!
- Now, that's no way to talk.
We're being square with you.
We came here to make an honest business deal... but if you're going to get rough about it... we'll handle it another way.
Get out!
That land rightfully belongs to us, and we mean to have it.
We'll give you a check that's as good as gold... and you give us that deed free and clear.
- I haven't got the deed.
- Where is it?
- I turned it over to the railroad company.
- He's lying.
You haven't had time for that.
Where is it? Where is it?
- I'll tear up this house to find it!
- [Chair Clatters]
[Footsteps Approaching]
Howdy, Mr. Jack.
I just left Miss Elizabeth, and she told me to tell you... that she'll hurry right home with the deed for your property.
So you haven't got the deed?
Take care of that woman out there.
Lock her up.
Company, halt.
Now, my scouts,
I'll be the advance guard.
Spread out, men. Shh!
[Hull]
Put up your hands. Now turn around.
Get in there. Hurry up.
Come on. Get in there.
[Door Closes]
- We mean to have that deed.
- We'd kill you for it if we had to.
[Hull]
And that isn't idle conversation either.
[Swazey]
So if you don't mind, we'll wait.
Come on!
Maria, where's my grandfather?
Why, honey, he's clean up at the other end of the place at the overseer's house.
- He went there this morning.
- Well, where's Walker?
You know, he drove to town.
Then you'll have to run and get help.
Papa Jack's in trouble with two bad men.
Trouble? Not me.
I don't mix in no white folks' doin's.
Please! It's for Papa Jack.
You've got to, Maria, right away!
- Trouble and trouble is all we got.
- Please hurry.
I'm gonna find my grandfather.
Where's the overseer's house?
- Way at the end of the woods.
- Follow me, men.
Not me. No, ma'am.
Them woods is the lastest place
I'll ever go.
All right.
If you won't go with me, I'll go alone.

- Much better, thank you.
Fevers are dreadful, aren't they?
We have an old family remedy
I'd like you to try.
Stop in at my house now.
I'll give it to you. It's only a step.
I really must be hurrying along.
Mr. Sherman's alone.
- Of course. Well, good night.
- Good night.

Why, Lloyd, what under the sun?
Why, child, what is it?
What's the matter?
Oh, Grandfather, you've got to come with me right away.
- Come where?
- Home with me to my house.
There's two bad men there... and they're saying bad things to my Papa Jack.
I wouldn't set foot in that house for anybody or anything.
But you've got to. Papa Jack is sick.
Those two men might hurt him.
Why should I help him?
Because he's my father, and I love him.
[Groans]
You're a bad, mean, wicked, hateful old man... and I never wanna see you again as long as I live!
Hey! Here, here! Wait a minute.
Sit down.
Why, good evening, Mrs. Sherman.
I'm happy to see you again, ma'am.
You're looking as beautiful as ever.
What is it, Jack? What do they want?
There's no need for alarm, ma'am.
We're here on business.
We just made a deal with your husband for his land out West.
Jack, is this true?
No. They cheated me once, and they're trying to do it again.
I won't trouble to explain further, ma'am.
- If you'll kindly give me the deed.
- No.
- I'd advise you to do it, ma'am. Sit down!
- Oh!
Come on.
Don't waste any more time.
My partner's a very impatient man.
- Becky, run for help!
- Oh, no, you don't.
Wait! Give them the deed, Elizabeth.
Now, that's what I call being sensible.
Hand it over, ma'am.
This is what we're after.
Here's your check.
- That makes it legal.
- [Colonel] What's going on here?
Put up your hands! Up with 'em!
Now, what's going on here?
Speak up!
What's the matter?
Has the cat got your tongue?
Hmm. Why, sir, this is just a business deal.
- There's nothing for anyone to get excited about.
- [Knocking]
- Who is it?
- Sheriff Wilkins.
Come in.
Howdy, Colonel. Your cook told me there was some trouble here.
Well, there was, but there isn't any now.
Take these two men and lodge 'em for the night.
- I'll see you in the morning.
- Come on, you two.
Father!

What's going on around here?
Subripped by:
Tantico (Croatia) 2011.
Hello, boys.
Hi, Steve.
This is Doc Chesley, my veterinarian. Hi, Doc.
I want to get right to the point, boys.
My horse Dream Prince is entered in the last race at Ascot this afternoon.
I'll send him out to lose if you pay me a thousand dollars each. Why would we?
You want me to draw ya a diagram?
The horse loses, you don't have to pay the bets people have made with ya, and you clean up.
Why pay a thousand dollars?
Might lose anyway.
He won his last two races on dope.
He can win again today on dope.
Why don't you dope him?
You tell him, Doc.
If we give Dream Prince a speedball today, he'll win the race, but it'll kill him.
He'll be dead an hour or two later.
You sentimental about Dream Prince,
Steve? No, I'm short of cash.
I haven't got enough to make a big bet, so I can't afford to kill him today.
That's your tough luck.
I ain't kicking in.
How much is bet on him in your book room? Between 1,000 and 2,000.
- And you?
- Thirty-five hundred.
- Sixteen hundred.
- Two grand.
- Eighteen hundred.
- Nearly 5,000.
I'm not in this racket for my health.
I see a chance to clean up
10,000 by letting my horse lose.
I want that 10,000, and I want it now!
Or I'll send Doc Chesley back and let him shoot the speedball.
But you said it'd kill him. It will, but he'll win the race.
And you saps will pay off to your customers.
I'll give ya three seconds to figure it out.
Looks like you figured it out for us.
How we gonna know he ain't gonna double-cross us?
I hear tell, when you was a bootlegger, you pulled some fast ones.
Now get this straight.
That horse better lose today.
I'm running this nightclub and racing horses.
You know where to find me.
Okay, I'm in.
You can count me in too.
I'll buy it, if you do something for us.
Send out a phony report that you're making a bet on your own horse to win.
Take it on the lam and spread it around.
Tell 'em I'm betting
10,000 on him. Right!
That'll double your play on the horse.
Hey. The boss is bettin'
10,000 on Dream Prince to win.
Yeah?
What's holding you up,
Sorrowful?
That's a lot of dough.
Come on. Dig.
So this is what you call muscling into the race racket, eh?
Putting the race racket on a business basis.
Yeah. Givin' us the business.
Hello, tightwad.
Hi, gold digger.
Hello.
Hello, baby.
Why the rush act? We goin' places? How'd you guess it?
Where? Over to Fifth Avenue to pick up that bracelet.
Dream Prince. Ten on the nose. Ten on the nose.
Initials, please. F.A.
Next. Five to win on Dream Prince.
Sorry, Eddie. We ain't takin' any markers.
Ask Sorrowful! Sorrowful's not in. Next.
One dollar,
Dream Prince to show.
I said "to show"!
Listen, Sorrowful, I wanna go for a fin on Dream Prince.
You take the I.O.U.
Till after the race.
Eddie, I dropped into the poorhouse last visitin' day and conditions were terrible.
The place was so overcrowded they were sleeping on the floor.
Who was? Bookmakers that used to take markers! Now, scram!
How about lending us a loan of two bucks, huh?
Tack on your heels and walk.
Hello, Boss.
How's it comin'?
All of a sudden, everybody's on Dream Prince.
Somebody must be in on the know.
Results of the fourth race at Blue Field's.
Cold Cuts, first, ten to one.
Easy Lady, second, two to one.
Mother O'Mine, third, even money.
I copped 50 bucks on Cold Cuts.
How about paying me now?
You know we pay at 4:00, Bennie.
I know, but I just thought I'd ask.
I want to bet $20 on Dream Prince to win.
- Not with an I.O.U.
- But I've already lost over $500 with you.
I wouldn't take a marker from my best friend, if I had a best friend.
Listen, Mr. Jones.
Be reasonable.
You can trust me. I haven't got the 20 on me, but I can get it.
Get it. But I might not be back in time for the race.
That's your tough luck.
No markers.
Hello.
Look. This is my little girl.
I'll leave her here while I go for the money.
I ain't takin' no dolls for security.
Look, Daddy. He is running away. Is he afraid?
- Take her down off there.
- Listen, Mr. Jones...
- You get down off there.
- You're afraid of my daddy.
Or you're afraid of me.
You're afraid of something.
Take his marker.
Marker!
Yeah. Little doll like that's worth
20 bucks any way you look at it.
Yeah, she ought to melt down for that much.
Do you want me to take her inside? Park her on that bench.
You be a good little girl, and Daddy will be right back.
I'm not afraid.
Listen, Sorrowful. I and Sore
Toe has an idea. I doubt it.
No, it's an idea, and it is as follows:
We'd like to put the bite on you.
All you gotta do is stand still long enough.
It won't be a big bite, just a nip.
It's hard to resist you, boys.
But I'm just able to do it by using all my strength.
Hey, you flatheads! We are gonna put the bite on Sorrowful.
Mind if I stick around and watch?
We have a very reliable tip, and we would like to bet two fish on...
Dream Prince.
I might add as follows:
We are good for it.
Because Bennie, The Gouge, is gonna give us 25 smackers per each for a fight tonight.
Bennie, The Gouge?
Who ya fightin'?
We ain't fightin' nobody.
We're fightin' ourselves.
I and Canvas Back is fightin' a semi-finale.
I thought you was a wrestler.
Sometimes I box with Canvas Back.
And sometimes I wrestle with Sore Toe. Mm-hmm.
I like boys who can do everything.
I will let you have not only two fish, but fifty fish.
Take their marker on Dream Prince for $50.
Go on and write that marker, because I'm gonna faint.
And I'm very sensitive about it.
Let me speak with Bennie, the Gouge.
- Hello?
- The $50 you won on Cold Cuts,
I just won from your two fighters.
You won't have to pay them tonight, so that makes us even.
It's a gift. A horse ain't even gone to the post yet, and the result is in and the bets is copped.
I know you.
You are the Black Knight.
Oh, go on, child.
I'm black day and night.
Where's your charger?
Huh?
The one with the white spot and pointed ears.
Huh?
- I'm the princess.
- Yes, Madam Princess.
And now for the last race at Ascot.
All right, boys.
Here it comes.
They're off! Dream Prince is still out in front. Come on, Dream Prince.
Come Easy is right on his tail.
Bingo is trying hard for second place.
Where are they now?
Ascot.
Dainty Foot is breaking the field, comin' up on the outside.
At the three-quarter,
Dainty Foot is comin' fast.
Dream Prince is still leading. The jockey is givin' him plenty of whip.
They're goin' into the stretch.
They're neck and neck!
They're nose to nose.
It's a close finish.
Here comes the winner.
Dainty Foot wins.
Aw, that tip cost me two bucks.
Bingo, second.
Come Easy, third.
Big Steve lost 10,000.
Baloney, I tell ya!
Dream Prince lost.
Here's the marker you took for that kid. Yeah.
Say, Dizzy. When that guy comes back for the little doll, don't you turn her over to him until you get that 20 bucks.
Yes, sir.
But she's gone, Boss.
Sneaked her out, eh?
That serves me right.
Every time I get bighearted...
When was the other time? No wisecracks.
Why didn't you watch her? Am
I also a nursemaid around here?
What'd you take the marker for anyway?
I don't know. The little doll bluffed me into it, I guess.
If you ever get through sweepin', lock up the joint and go home. Yes, sir.
My goodness. She stay upstairs in my restaurant all afternoon.
Eat two time chop suey... free!
What are you doing,
Black Knight?
I done thought your pappy come got you. Maybe he forgot me.
Does he go around forgettin' you?
He forgot me once at the circus, and they arrested the man that found me.

Her old man never did come back.
Where are you going, Black
Knight? Home, Princess.
I'm leaving you with him.
- Yours?
- You know I ain't married.
This is the little kid Sorrowful picked up for the $20 marker.
- Who are you anyway?
- My name is MarthyJane.
Hey. That's very "co-accidental. "
Marthy sounds like marker, and that's just what she is.
Little Miss Marker.
Where's your old man?
Your daddy.
I don't know.
- Where do you live?
- In a house made of bricks.
There must be at least two of those. Which one is it?
It's not as nice as a castle.
- What castle?
- Sir Lancelot knows about the castle.
Sir Lancelot?
He is Sir Lancelot.
Everybody knows you're a fast worker, but why hand a line to a young dame like that?
I didn't hand her any line. Kids are always pickin' up things like that.
Say, she's a chunky little filly.
Chunky? I'll bet she don't weigh 45 pounds.
- For how much?
- You name it.
How about it?
Let's get organized.
We'll each put 100 in a pool. The man who gets closest takes the money.
Okay with me.
I'll still say 45 pounds.
You are the Strong Knight.
Hey. What have you been doing?
Showing her your muscles?
Quit wisecracking.
Forty pounds.
I'm not used to hefting young dames.
Forty-six pounds.
You are the Honest Knight.
What have you been doing?
Showing her your parole? Nix.
Give the kid to me.
All right. Here.
You guys ought to be ashamed of yourself, tossing a kid like that around like a ball.
I like it.
I can tell best by walking a little with her. Uh-huh.
Tell me what you weigh, kid, and
I'll buy ya a doll. I don't know.
- Come on, Bennie. Stop chiselin'.
- Me? Chiseling?
I was just tellin' her a story.
Forty-three pounds.
You are Sir Percy.
She's making storybook fairies out of us.
That would be something to look at.
- You take her, Regret.
- Not me, not me.
I'm not dizzy enough for this.
I hear you've been dizzy plenty trying to guess things about a certain redhead.
I wasn't interested in her weight.
Why don't you lift me?
I don't wanna lift ya.
Lift me!
No!
Aw, go on.
Go ahead, Sorrowful.
Are you Sir Sorry, the Sad Knight?
Forty-and-a-half pounds.
You hold the stakes. Come on.
We'll weigh her in the kitchen.
Sir Percivale, Sir Sorry,
Sir Lancelot.
We're all dizzy.
You are Lady Guinevere.
King Arthur's Lady Guinevere?
You know about it too?
Yes.
Did you ever break a lance for a lady fair?
Not recently.
Who is Sir Galahad,
Marky?
He's the best of all.
I haven't seen him around here.
But I know who you are.
Yes?
You are the Kind Keeper. The
Kind Keeper of what, Marky?
Of the charger, the horse the princess rides.
Who told you about all this?
My mommy used to read to me about King Arthur.
Where is your mother? My mommy got awfully tired and went away.
She's never coming back anymore.
Bring her over here.
Who had top weight?
My guess was 46 pounds.
You lose. Who's next?
I said 45.
You lose! Next?
Forty-three.
Take a deep breath.
Cut it out, Bennie. When I lifted her, she was breathin' natural.
You lose.
I win by three ounces.
Wait a minute.
Hey, nix.
She had it on when I tested her.
My guess is
40-and-a-half pounds.
Outguessed ya, Steve.
Come on, babe.
Let's get outta here.
So long, kid.
Good-bye, Lady Guinevere.
We are in a jam.
She's on our hands for tonight.
"Our hands"?
Since when have you started sharing with other citizens?
Listen, I've always been generous in a quiet way.
Very quiet.
Practically silent.
What am I gonna do with a kid? Keep her till tomorrow.
Her old man will show up.
Is that what she weighs,
40 pounds?
Forty-and-a-half pounds of trouble.
Psst!
I wouldn't say anything about that if I were you.
Oh, you ready for bed?
But I can't sleep in my underwear.
All right.
Take them off.
They button up the back.
See?
There you are.
Well, what is it?
I didn't go to the bathroom.
Okay, scram. Scram.
If I had any sense, I'd have taken her to the police station.
Sir Sorry,
I haven't any toothbrush.
Skip it.
Are you playing a game?
Yeah.
- What are you playing?
- Sucker.
Hello, kid.
Listen, baby.
Climb out of the hay and meet me over at Sorrowful's office with the ice.
'Cause I need dough!
So you lost all that money in a card game, huh?
You want my new bracelet too?
Okay, Indian giver.
Sarah?
Yes'm?
Get my jewel case.
They ain't goin' away again, is they, Miss Bangles? Yep.
But they only just come back from the pawnshop. I know.
I'm thinking of having a bracelet made out of the pawn tickets.
We was just thinkin' of havin' breakfast.
But like you know, we have no scratch whatever.
Watch this doll till her old man gets back, and I'll give you two bits for breakfast.
But we're hungry now.
You'll be hungrier later.
There is something to that. I agree with ya.
When you come to think of it, there is. Mind her!
Do we have to do everything this little girl says?
I want that big stick of peppermint.
But we... Sorrowful said to mind her.
Hello! So you still got the kid, huh?
Yeah. When that guy shows for his kid, collect the dough he owes me.
Twenty bucks.
Twenty-one bucks.
Her dinner cost me 85 cents, and
I spent 15 cents for her breakfast.
What? No carfare? Hi, Steve. Hi.
I need 10,000.
It's okay with you?
It's not only okay, it's a habit.
So this is what they call goin' for a dame in a big way?
Try it sometime. Pick me up a doll that can make me do it.
Maybe I'll pick up a guy who will give and let me keep.
Listen, baby.
I'm only borrowin' the ice.
I want that 10,000 to bet on Dream
Prince when he runs at Viaduct.
That plug?
He lost yesterday.
When he runs at Viaduct, we'll slip him the speedball.
He'll walk away with it at ten to one.
Ten thousand at ten to one.
That's $100,000.
I am sorry to disturb you, citizens.
But wrap your ears around this.
"Big Steve's Stables suspended for 30 days. " Ouch!
"Yesterday's race by Dream
Prince to be investigated.
"Betting coup rumor reaches officials.
Books carried heavy play on horse. Jockey denies pulling. "
Well, you won't need the money now.
I've been suspended, but the horse ain't.
He can't run as long as you own him.
I'll get him a phony owner.
I'll turn him over to somebody I can trust.
Who do we know who ain't in the race racket and is a square shooter?
How about Bennie, The Gouge?
He's not in the race racket.
And if he was, it would be too bad for us.
Why can't I own him?
Because it's known to all that you're Big Steve's girl.
Who then?
Everybody speaks highly of the Statue of Liberty.
Hey.
"Bets $20 on losing horse, then takes life. An unidentified man was found dead...
"in his gas-filled attic room this morning in Prindle Alley.
"In his pocket was found a scribbled ticket... some bookmaker had given him for a $20 bet on Dream Prince. "
It's the kid's father.
Bumped himself off.
Tells about the kid and everything.
Janitor thinks he left the kid with friends.
I'm having fun!
Go out and have some more fun, kid.
You can use it.
Well, she goes to the cops now for sure.
This ain't findin' a new owner for the horse.
Give me Police Headquarters.
You got no more chance of finding a square shooter...
than that kid has of ever seeing her old man.
Never mind.
I'll lend you the money, Steve, providing you bet half for me.
Why should I? Because I've got the new owner, one you can trust.
Show me the new owner first.
There.
You mean Marky?
What do you mean, you're takin' my stick to my barbershop...
Oh, my peppermint stick!
Ooh!
Hey, what is this? You told us to mind her and she wanted it.
Step back, Steve.
This horse is afraid of you.
The charger!
Look out, honey.
Oh, he won't hurt her.
He's gentle as a kitten except...
I want him. I want this charger. He's yours, darling.
Mine? Marky's?
All yours.
May I ride on him?
- Get him in the van. Take him away!
- Stay back!
They're taking my charger away.
I told you to keep away from him. You know he's afraid of you.
Why should he be afraid of me?
Horses are afraid of some people, and they don't explain why.
- Get him over to Viaduct!
- Okay.
Come here, Doc.
I want the odds to stay at ten to one, ya understand?
Anybody ask ya about his condition just say he's still slowed down.
They won't believe that if you go bettin' on him.
That's all right. I'm leaving for Chicago tomorrow.
I want to place all my bets out there on the quiet.
I'll get the money down at ten to one before the New York mob gets wise to my play out there.
Okay. I'll be back the day after the race. dd
Gee, that's a swell tune.
Gonna miss me, honey?
I miss things easy.
From now on, baby, you can nail down the ice.
Our end of this is gonna be 50,000.
"Our end"?
Mm-hmm.
Wonder why Sorrowful don't show up with that dough.
I was just waitin' for you two to come up for air.
Remember you're bettin' half of this for... I know. Half for you.
Time to beat it, Boss.
No playin' around.
You notice how he trusts me? Hmm.
Keep your eye on her, Sorrowful. Sure.
Well, tightwad, you're my watchman.
You'll need watchin', gold digger.
If you wanna be kept busy,
I can arrange it.
I'm busy now playin' nursemaid to one doll.
I hear you like it so well you got a new apartment for the kid.
- I couldn't stable her in that little...
- Hello, Sorrowful.
Hello, Copper. Regret told me I'd find you over here.
One of your tickets, ain't it? Yeah.
We found it in the pocket of a guy who killed himself.
He had a kid. You see or hear anything about her?
No.
Uh-huh.
Thanks.
dd
Takin' a long chance, ain't ya?
Got to keep her now till after the race.
But it looks like playin' nursemaid is liable to have its moments.
I think as follows: This is a swell joint Sorrowful's got here.
I agree with ya. He must have spent most of our 50 bucks on this setup.
Cold!
How could it be cold when there's no ice?
That's right.
It must be us that's cold.
Hey, are you tryin' to get gay? Listen, now...
You want to wake up that kid again?
He smacked me on the brain.
Sir Sorry!
She's back again.
You go to bed.
I don't wanna go to bed.
What do you do about putting a baby to sleep?
Tell her the dirt about Bunny
Rabbit and the big bad Foxy-Woxy.
How they comin', kid?
Where did she pick that up? Listenin' to you mugs.
Now, you go to bed.
Nix to that.
The kid is getting tough. You'd better tell her a fairy story.
Oh, come on.
Let's play cards.
It's up to you to bet. You got a couple of ladies showing.
A couple of queens ain't much, but I'll bet two bucks.
Oh, look!
A picture of Lady Guinevere.
Oh! Three
Lady Guineveres.
And me with only two King Arthurs.
What do you mean by picking up that card?
I put you to bed three times. You get in there and stay in there!
Lay off. She don't know no better.
She spoiled the killing for me.
Look, it's all right.
He didn't mean nothin'.
He doesn't like me!
He don't even like himself. I want my daddy!
I propose as follows:
You go to sleep.
Look, kid, at the watch.
I don't wanna.
Hey, where did you get that watch?
Don't be technical at a time like this.
Look, Canvas Back and I, we'll make fun for ya, huh?
Well, personally, I think the watch is a better gag.
Hey, me eye!
Now I got ya.
How do you like this hold?
L- I liked that.
It's a setup.
Come on, you guys.
Go on home.
What about the poker game?
We'll set it up tomorrow night.
Good night.
So long.
What did you want to stick your finger in my eye for?
Honest I didn't mean it.
I was only playing.
Now, what's the matter now?
You don't like me!
Do you always cry when somebody don't like ya? Yes!
You got a lot of crying to do. Go to sleep.
My mother used to read to me about King
Arthur every night before I went to sleep.
Be reasonable!
I won't!
All right, all right.
All right.
What's that, uh...
What's that guy's name?
King Arthur.
King Arthur, all right.
"When they bang away from the tape tomorrow at Pimlico,
"you can wager the family knives and forks that...
"that King Arthur will be showing his heels to the best of them.
Tomorrow morning when...
King Arthur steps out... "
Hmm? "It is conceded by the wise rail birds...
"that he will hang up a new record.
"Although the track is liable to be muddy,
"uh, King Arthur will go splashing through the wind.
In the Preakness last year, King Arthur showed what he had by running the mile in one... "
Give that guy the rouse.
I'll tell you about it later.
Go on. Scram.
Who are you? I'm the guy that just told you to scram.
You leave me alone!
Take your hands off!
Who's he?
A pest.
If he'd have followed me home,
I'd have never gotten rid of him.
So you bring him here?
You're my watchman.
Big Steve was hardly out of town when you step out with a good-time Charley!
Stop yelling at me.
Well, he's gone. Beat it.
Sir Sorry!
Are you satisfied?
I spent all night puttin' her to sleep and you come here and start yelling!
Sir Sorry!
Wait. I'll put her to sleep.
And when you do, blow.
I'm goin' to bed.
Oh. Hello.
Why aren't you asleep?
Aw, lay off me.
Oh, that's no way to talk, honey.
Will you sing to me?
Will you go to sleep then?
Sure. d Go to sleep, you gorgeous little rascal d d Thank your lucky stars you got a bed d d You better get your shut-eye while the gettin' is good d d You've got some tough nights ahead d d You'll grow up and find it's all a racket d d Cards are stacked against ya from the start d

d Go to sleep and dream about your charger d dd d Sir Galahad is waitin'... dd
Well, what are you doing up? Lookin' for some eats.
Ain't you ever anything but hungry?
You wait till nurse gets here.
She'll get your breakfast.
We are hungry.
Well, I ain't hungry.
Well, we are.
What do you mean "we"?
She would be hungry when she wakes up.
Hey, what's the idea?
"Idea"?
Where's the kid?
The kid's up.
"Up"?
I sang myself to sleep. Yeah, your singin' is like that.
I'm not runnin' a flophouse for dames to sleep out.
I don't happen to be a dame that sleeps out. I fell asleep accidental.
Usin' my place as a hideout from a good-time Charley.
Aw, shut up. All right.
Take it on the lam.
As soon as I get some clothes.
You're wearin' clothes.
I'm not going out this time of day with these clothes on.
If you went home nights, instead of hanging around with a...
Maybe I could get home nights, if you didn't shout and wake up kids.
I wouldn't have to shout if you stayed away.
It won't happen again.
I'll give you plenty of air.
I'll take gallons of it. Better than that, I'll give you oceans of it.
I'll take three oceans worth. You would. It's free.
The nurse isn't here yet, and I wanna get dressed.
All right, honey. Go and get your clothes. I'll dress you.
Circle seven, one, six, three, three.
Why, honey, it's all torn. That's all I got.
Hello, Sarah?
Bring your clothes?
Where did you all say?
Who? Mr. SorrowfulJones?
Yes'm, Miss Bangles.
I'll hurry.
Mr. SorrowfulJones.
A delivery boy says they're for you.
I didn't order this stuff, whatever it is.
Come here!
What's these?
Miss Carson ordered them. Bangles?
What did you bring them here for?
She said to deliver them to her apartment after I collected here.
Collected?
Yes, sir, $52.60.
You tell him that.
Yeah, that's right.
We're not questionin' the amount.
Pay this guy.
Huh?
You said pay him?
Now, once more, Marky, and do it the way I told you.
All right, but I want to sit on the piano like you do.
All right. dd d Look at the funny side and have your fun d d Stay by your honey's side and laugh, you son of a gun d d It doesn't cost a thing d d To buy the sun d d You haven't lost a thing

Hi, gold digger.
Hello!
Oh, Sir Sorry, look at my new dress.
She looks human now. Oh, I've got so many pretty clothes.
$52.60 to buy clothes for a little doll like her!
Why didn't you send them back? 'Cause
I wasn't there when they was delivered.
Regret paid for 'em.
When I got home and found the things here,
I thought I'd guessed right for a change.
"Guessed right"?
Oh, let it go.
You wouldn't understand anyway.
Looks like you could be happy in a swell joint like this.
Sure.
Steve phoned four times last night between 1:00 and 5:00 this morning.
If Steve finds out you stayed at my place...
Oh, I phoned him a while ago.
I told him I had the kid here and shut off the phone.
Oh, you handed him a line. Yeah.
I was afraid he'd put the slug on ya. He might get in a jam.
For puttin' the slug on me?
There's probably a law against it.
Come on, you dogs!
Show 'em your heels!
Come on, you dogs!
Give 'em the whip!
Hooray! The winner!
Here. When you get the kid to your place, you might try reading to her out of this instead of that racing form.
Oh, I paid for it myself.
It's a little worn, ain't it?
I hadn't noticed it.
Maybe I should have ordered you some clothes.
You dames worry a lot about clothes, don't ya?
It ain't only clothes. When a girl starts going for a guy, clothes don't mean a thing.
Yeah, I hear they get married even in them nudist colonies.
Good-bye, Lady Guinevere.
Good-bye, Marky.
"Sir Lancelot came home two days...
"before the Feast of Pentecost.
"King Arthur and all the court were full glad of his coming.
"When Sir Gawain,
Sir Uwaine,
Sir Sag... Sir... "
Sir Sagramore.
"Sir Sagramore...
"saw Sir Lancelot in Sir Kay's armor,
"then they wished well it was he that... smote them down all with one spear. "
I want the other one. What other one? This is King Arthur, ain't it?
I want the King Arthur you was reading me about.
What King Arthur? That was always kicking dust in the face of a lot of bang tails.
Talkin' like that ain't nice. What's nice?
Bein' a good girl is nice.
I'm a bad girl. Nurse says so. Why?
Nurse says there's somebody named God.
A girl's bad if she doesn't pray to him every night.
Yeah?
Daddy says there's nobody named God.
When did he say that?
When my mom went away.
I guess your daddy got a bad break.
But what he said wasn't right... not just right.
He kind of forgot a little. I mean, there is somebody named God.
Do you know Him?
I heard about Him.
From what I hear,
He's a pretty good sport.
Always trying to give a citizen a break.
There's something you want and can't promote it for yourself, ask God for it.
As often as not,
He comes through.
You write letters to Him like you do to Santa Claus?
Oh, no. That's where praying comes in.
But bad girls like me can't pray.
You ain't a bad girl.
Then show me how to pray.
You lay down and go to sleep.
But I want to ask for something. You would.
Regret knows everything. I'll ask him to show me how to pray.
Now don't you go asking that mug Regret about anything.
All right.
Get out of bed.
I'll show ya how to pray... sort of.
But don't you tell anybody.
See?
Is it a secret?
Between you and me.
Now, kneel down.
Put your hands together like this.
Elbows on the bed.
Shut your eyes.
You gonna shut yours too? Nope.
I got to see that you do it right.
Now what do I do?
Say like this:
"Now I lay me down to sleep...
Now I lay me down to sleep...
"and pray the Lord my soul to keep.
And pray the Lord my soul to keep.
"If I should die before I wake,
If I should die before I wake,
I pray the Lord my soul to take. "
I pray the Lord my soul to take.
And make me a good little girl.
You wanna be a little girl?
No, no, dear.
Make you a good little girl.
Make me a good little girl.
Is that all?
That's the works.
But when do
I ask for what I want?
You better do it right now while your prayer's still hot.
Please, God, buy Sir Sorry a new suit of clothes.
You're crazy.
You don't believe it?
I didn't believe it myself.
I had to get soused before I...
Regret's on a bender.
She goes out and buys
$52.60 worth of clothes... and charges-s-s them to him and he paid.
You paid. He wasn't there when they were delivered.
Listen, tootsy,
I am crocked now.
But I was sober yesterday when the boy... came in to collect $52.60 and Sorrowful paid.
Then he was there.
He did pay.
Sure. He opened the box, and he looked at the... stuff.
And he turned to me and he says, "Regret," he says,
"pay this guy. "
And that is the reason
I am on this bender.
So, I am up at Sorrowful's house this afternoon...
Regret's been seeing things. Tsk, tsk, tsk.
I am up at Sorrowful's house this afternoon.
And I am talking with the little girl.
And all of a sudden...
Something comes through the door, and I look twice and it's...
It's Sorrowful!
One, sir?
Scram!
Good evening, sir. Your chair, sir. Beat it.
Yes, sir.
Can I touch?
Can't a citizen buy a new suit of clothes without everybody goin' batty?
What I mean, Sorrowful, you look swell.
Looks all right, huh?
It's the best break a suit of clothes has had in years.
It ain't because of anything I said, is it?
No. Ain't because of anything anybody said.
I needed a new suit of clothes and I got it. Now lay off.
Pardon my enthusiasm.
I couldn't help it.
You buyin' the kid a new wardrobe...
I told you Regret paid for the kid's clothes, didn't I?
Mmm. I know.
I suppose if you'd have been there, you'd have sent them back.
Why not?
All that dough for...
All right, tightwad.
Why the disguise?
Aw, lay off him.
Can't a guy wear a different suit without startin' a riot?
Was you lookin' for something, Copper?
Yeah. The kid.
Another kid get lost?
No, it's the same kid.
One of them orphan societies is on our neck.
You know. Afraid she might have fallen into the hands of the wrong people.
Got time to take a run up to that new apartment of yours?
What for?
That ticket ties you in.
I've got to take a look around your place.
You know.
Just for the record anyway.
All right. We was just fixin' to get something to eat.
Yeah.
All right, I'll...
I'll wait for ya.
Give me the keys.
But...
Quick. Go to the bar and stall him.
Where are they?
In the bedroom, Mr. Jones.
Say...
You're telling me.
Gee, don't you wish you could sleep like that?
I can, without wishin'.
You probably snore.
Oh, so you listened, huh?
Have a drink?
Thanks.
Reardon searched my place.
He's sending a woman from one of them orphan societies tomorrow.
You mean you can't take her back to your place?
If they find her, they may get wise to the frame up on Dream Prince.
Well, you can't leave her here. Afraid of the cops?
No.
Then what?
I'm afraid of the kid.
I don't want her here.
I'm not going sappy over her.
I won't! See?
You're already sappy over her. But you're not?
She's just something I can't get rid of, because... she's tangled up in a race deal.
Wasn't tangled up in a deal the first night. You could have unloaded her.
You didn't stage no riot when she busted up your song at the nightclub.
- You read King Arthur to her.
- You take her out and buy new clothes.
And you stood still for the bite without even being chloroformed!
All right, I did pay!
Her clothes were falling off her.
Oh, Sorrowful.
I'm like you.
I don't wanna admit it.
The way she's gotten to... us.
She's given me a chance to get to you.
I've been crazy about you for a long time.
Oh, everything is different.
Maybe that's part of... of going sappy.
I used to call you names, but now... it's like you're somebody else.
Not Sorrowful.
A different guy.
In a new suit. I know lots of swell-looking suits walking around.
We're forgetting
I'm Steve's girl.
Steve's out of town.
And when he comes back?
I was just lookin' after ya. See?
Steve will never know.
Well, that keeps my record clean.
My record for always guessing wrong.
Now, get out!
Take it away.
Don't want no mush. Scram!
But Miss Bangles said you always to have a hot breakfast.
Aw, what does she know?
What's the matter, Marky?
Tryin' to hand me mush.
Don't you like it?
No!
Say, no, thank you.
Say it like this:
No, thank you, Bangles.
I don't care for any.
What for?
You used to say "thank you" and "no, thank you. "
I used to be a sissy.
Now, where did you get that?
Ain't tellin'.
And I don't want no mush!
Don't you like me anymore? Well...
You used to like me when I was Lady Guinevere.
There ain't no Lady Guinevere.
Oh, yes, there is, dear.
Just like there's a charger.
There ain't no charger.
But you saw him.
They took him away.
Well, maybe they'll bring him back if you remember to say "thank you"?
Well, maybe I will stand for some mush.
Thank you.
Some cream?
A little.
Please.
There's two gentlemen to see you all, Miss Bangles.
Hiya, palsy-walsies! Hi,
Marky, old scouterino.
We were told to bring you this.
What are ya eatin'?
Mush?
Baby food.
I ain't eatin' it.
I don't care for any.
Thank you.
That's better, honey.
Imagine making a kid say "tanks" for mush.
She's makin' a sissy out of her.
So that's where she got this stuff!
Well, she's not going with you.
Now, beat it!
She said, "Beat it!"
I wanna go with them.
No, honey.
They's gone.
Is you gonna keep her?
A girl in my racket?
Hey, what's the idea?
I've been double-crossed.
And I'm goin' back to New York to ask somebody a few questions.
dd
Hey, why so high-hat?
Sit down.
Dropped in to say
I'm sorry about, uh...
Forget about the other night.
I wanted to see you too.
Just coffee, please.
Same here.
Yes, sir.
Goin' for someone in a big way?
Thought you looked kind of undressed without 'em.
Thanks for changing your mind about the kid.
It's only for a few days more.
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
Do you remember those dizzy fairies she used to have?
King Arthur and his mob?
They're gone.
We gypped her out of them, and now she's just a mug... like us.
What's the matter with that?
When we first met her, she was a sweet kid.
Nice people would have been glad to have her, but now she hasn't got a chance.
Because she's a little tough now? She's plenty tough.
They want kids who have been brought up right. Who does?
Nice people.
You know, young married couples who have no kids of their own.
Why don't you get nice and adopt her?
'Cause I'm not a young married couple.
You'd love to see her get a good home, wouldn't you? Yeah, sure.
Well, she won't. Not unless we can change her back to what she was.
Read the book to her.
That won't work.
We showed her Big Steve's plug and called it the charger.
We told her it was hers, then snatched it away from her.
That started her off, and now, she doesn't believe anything about King Arthur anymore.
She's got to be shown. Let her take another look at the horse.
And King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table.
Yeah, but where you gonna get them?
I got it figured out.
Come on.
Oh, decided to get democratic and mingle with the riff and the raff, huh?
I'm inviting you all to a party.
You gonna pour tea, Duchess?
It's a kid party, kind of.
Will we have rattles and toy balloons to play with?
Listen, Sorrowful has okayed it. Yep.
It's to give the kid a break.
Introduce her to society, huh?
No, get her back on speaking terms with those fairies she used to have.
We'll dress up as...
As what?
Sir Galahad, Sir Lancelot,
Sir Gawain, Sir Percivale...
Me social calendar is filled for the season.
Oh, please.
It's for the kid.
Let them as will, swim channels and such for their kiddies.
But I will never dress up as Sir Percivale.
You've got to!
In English, in German, in French, in Italian, yes, even in Scandinavia, the answer is no!
Get me some more beer!
I want some beer!
I want some beer now.
Listen, you mugs!
Keep quiet! Pay attention!
You're Knights of the Round Table, and you gotta play straight for the kid.
This is her party. She's gonna get a kick outta seeing her storybook fairies come to life.
- You gotta act according.
- According to what?
According to the hop that
Bangles read ya outta this book.
You're supposed to be regular knights.
Quiet, quiet, quiet!
Before we get goin', does anybody want to know anything else?
Yes, there is one thing I would like to know. What?
What am I doin' here?
I'm sorry, but the club is reserved for a private party tonight.
Who waits without? Two knights for the Round Table.
Two knights for the Round Table.
Two knights for the Round Table.
Pray have the two knights enter.
What an extraordinary party.
Enter two knights for the Round Table.
I would like to know as follows: How we gonna get this hardware back to the museum?
We'll throw the suits in the river.
But we gotta remember one thing. What's that?
First we gotta get outta the suits. That's a good idea.
I'm glad you thought of it.
Hello, Bugs!
Why, you dirty...
Ooh!
Do that when
I'm lookin', will ya?
dd
Pipe down! Pipe down!
The princess!
Welcome, Princess, to the Round Table!
We salute you, Princess, and would die for you.
Go ahead.
That would be something.
These are all my brave knights, and this is Sir Lancelot.
What's the big idea,
Regret?
I ain't Regret.
I am Sir Lancelot.
Why, dear, don't you see? All of your knights have come to life.
Hooey!
They ain't no knights.
That makes it unanimous.
But, look. Can't you see these are knights?
Sure, you can tell as follows:
Look at these tin suits.
I agree with ya.
Look at 'em.
Why are they all dressed up in ash cans?
She's too grown up.
She's spoilin' our children's party.
She was gonna get a big kick outta this, huh?
We might as well wash this up and go home.
It turns out we're givin' this clambake for ourselves.
Can't be blamed for tryin', kid.
Wait. There's still the charger.
It cost us 25 bucks to bring the nag here. We might as well try it.
Varlet!
The charger!
Varlet! The charger!
The charger!
You brought him back to me.
Sir Sorry brought him back to you.
Oh, Sir Sorry.
Is he mine now? Mine? My very own? Yes.
For always?
Yes.
L... I didn't know you liked me. Well, I...
But I...
I always liked you.
Want to kiss me? Well, I ain't runnin' for mayor.
Give.
You are Sir Galahad, the greatest one of all.
And you are the Kind Keeper.
Thank you, Princess.
May I ride him now?
Why, of course, Princess, and all my brave knights will follow you. d East side, west side d d All around the town d d The cops play ring the rosie d d London Bridge is falling down d d Boys and girls together d

You heard what she said about me, the Kind Keeper. Yeah?
And tomorrow morning I'm going to shoot that into her charger's neck.
It'll make him win the race, but it'll kill him. Kill him?
So that Steve can buy more bangles for his Lady Guinevere.
You give me that.
Get out. dd
Are you going to kill her horse?
To a kid, one horse is like another.
But there couldn't be another. He's something she believes in again.
I can't throw 50,000 away for a little doll.
Reardon said he was afraid the kid would fall into the hands of the wrong people.
It looks like she has.
I thought maybe he was wrong.
But it was me who was wrong.
I could have gone for you.
I thought maybe you had changed, you had a decent streak in you, but you haven't.
You're not even halfway decent.

Who closed my joint? Sorrowful bought it out for a party.
Know anything about this?
"You better come back and ask
Bangles some questions. Sarah. "
Who's Sarah? She's the maid I got planted in Bangles' apartment.
What do you know?
All I know, Boss, is that
I'm supposed to be a fairy.
dd
Just get back?
Yeah! d How happy we'll be d
Ahead of time, ain't ya? Yeah.
Who brought that horse in here?
I did.
Hey! Y'all gone crazy?
Get that kid off that horse.
No, please, Steve.
- Get off!
- He is my charger.
Stay back, Steve.
Marky!
Whoa! Whoa!
Marky! Marky!
She was having such a good time.
Doctor?
Her condition is critical.
Internal injuries.
Dr. Ingalls is on his way to Gramercy Park Church.
Of course. I'd forgotten.
He's getting married tonight.
Who's Dr. Ingalls?
A child's surgeon.
Is he the best?
Best in the world. dd
Well, Doctor, it'll be any moment now.
I feel as though I were about to perform my first operation all over again.
I mean, stage fright.
dd
Come on.
Dr. Ingalls?
Yes?
I'm going to be married!
You can get married anytime!
And she stayed over to his place one night.
And he gave her back the ice, huh? Yes, sir.
Hey, Boss, ain't that kind of risky around a hospital?
Shut up. With a flock of doctors around?
Doctors ain't gonna do him any good. You stay here.
We'll have to do a transfusion at once. Yes, Doctor.
Please, tell me.
It's transfusion.
You'd better all come along for a blood test.
Of course.
Won't any of us do?
None of you match.
Why, there's Dr. Ingalls. This is magnificent of you. Magnificent!
This gentleman has explained the situation.
Phone Gramercy Park Church. Tell them I'll be back as soon as possible.
Yes, Doctor.
The bloods don't match.
Get group two immediately.
Is it a transfusion for the baby? Yes.
Try us.
Of course. Come on.
Pulse is failing.
We can't operate until we find a donor.
Oxygen.
No go.
None of you'll do.
We've located a professional donor.
He'll be here in 15 minutes. That'll be too late.
Never mind.
You two played a nice little game. Steve.
Take your hand out of your pocket, Steve. Just your hand.
Is this another volunteer?
Why, yes. All right. Send him in.
What's the idea?
Get in that room, Steve.
Inside.
Take off your coat, Steve.
What is this?
Sit down and roll up your sleeve.
They match.
Come with me, please.
Hurry up, Steve!
Come on.
We found a donor, Doctor.
Good. Bring him in.
In you go, Steve.
Lie down here, please.
Okay.
L... I got a lot of nerve comin' to You now.
But I'm doin' it for her.
Don't let anything happen to her.
Don't seem like she ought to die.
Give her a break.
She's such a little doll.
I'm not asking anything for myself.
Not a thing.
I'm sorry for everything I said.
You called me by the right name.
I'm the cheapest skate on Broadway.
You're the grandest guy
I've ever known.
If the kid lives, the three of us might...
She's got to live.
For us.
Look. She's getting alive.
Your blood is giving her life.
My blood?
Get a kick out of it?
Giving life?
Giving life.
I can operate now and save her.
Gee, that's swell.
It's like I was her old man.
You've got good blood.
Me?
Strong, good blood.
Stop the oxygen.
The Strong Knight.
Is that all?
Yes. And thanks.
Well, the doll's gonna live.
And you know why?
'Cause I got good blood.
Well, Steve?
From now on, he can buy them for ya.
And don't forget!
I've got good blood!
Blackfeet.
Smoke.
Do you smell it, sir?
They certainly made a thorough job of it.
Aye, they did that, sir.
- You'll probably find shovels in one of the wagons.
- Yes, sir.
What-
No! Don't touch me!
Go away!
Please! Please go away!
- We're not going to hurt you.
- Leave me alone!
- The Indians will come back and kill me too!
- There, lassie.
- Let me go!
- There, there.
You're perfectly safe now.
We won't let anyone harm you.
They'll come back!
I know they will!
They killed my grandfather.
He's over there under that wagon.
- Shh! Shh! Come on.
- No.
- Come on now. That's it.
- Please! Please!
Everything's going to be all right.
Everything's going to be all right.
There now, now.
Shh. Everything's all right.
I'm afraid.
Now, listen, Sue.
You and I are going to have a little talk.
You know, there never was anything to be afraid of... that couldn't be cured by one little word.
Do you know what that word is?
" Courage.'' It can beat the toughest situation that ever happened.
You see, when you're afraid of things... the more you think of'em, the bigger they get.
But if you just throw your head back and say...
" I won't be scared of anything anymore,'' then you're not.
Aren't you ever afraid of anything?
Well, uh, let's put it this way:
When I meet up with something
I'm not quite sure of...
I decide first of all that everything's going to come out all right.
Whatever it is,
I'm going to lick it.
And usually it does come out all right.
- You know what does it?
- Courage?
Courage.
Now, let's forget everything that made us unhappy.
Let's learn to smile again, because we know everybody's... gonna do all they can to help us, so we'll help too.
- What do you say?
- I'll try, Mr. Monty.
That's the girl.
Now, back to sleep.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Easy.
Dismissed, Mac.
- Welcome home! Praise be you're safe and-
- Shh!
- What have you got there?
- Quiet. Quiet.
- Where in heaven's name did you get her?
- You'll hear about that later.
- Is the superintendent still up?
- He is.
- And if I told you the half of it-
- I can't escape it.
Give me a quick brush.
I want to report in.
Beggin' your pardon, sir.
You can't go in them clothes.
- I've your other uniform all laid out.
- Why should I change uniforms...
- at this time of night?
- The others, sir.
Every one of'em is dressed up like a widow at a wake. If you knew who was there-
- I wouldn't dandy up tonight to meet Lily Langtry.
- But it's the O.C. 's daughter.
- Will you stop thatjabbering and brush me off?
- I'll do it!
- I'll do it. Please let me.
- Now look what you've done with your shouting.
You're the worst old fishwife ever came out of County Kildare.
He's otherwise known as
Patrick O'Hannegan.
- This is Miss Susannah Sheldon.
-Just call me Sue.
Now, young lady, we'll have to arrange sleeping quarters for you.
- Where will that be, sir?
- Your room.
- My-
- Do I sleep in with him?
No. Pat can sleep out here on the couch.
But I wouldn't wanna take
Mr. Pat's room.
That's all right. He'll be very comfortable out here, won't you?
- Oh, yes, sir. Very.
- Give this a lick.
Let's see.
What about sleeping things?
Use one of my nightshirts.
You might have to cut it down.
- Now, young lady, off to bed with you.
- Oh, wait.
There's a hair on your shoulder the brush didn't get.
- Good night.
- Good night, Mr. Monty.
Come on.
I'll fix the bed for ya.
I'll help you. dd dd
- Excuse me, sir.
- That's quite all right, Monty.
- Glad to see you're back.
- I didn't mean to intrude, sir.
- I've come to make my report.
- Come in, won't you?
I want you to meet my daughter.
She's come out from Toronto for a visit.
Well, I'm-
I'm hardly presentable, sir.
Perfectly all right.
Come along.
- Look who's here.
- Hello, Monty.
- Hello, fellas.
- Hi, old boy.
Vicky, this is
Inspector Montague.
- I'm very happy to know you, Mr. Montague.
- It's a pleasure, Miss Standing.
Won't you join us?
Perhaps you'd like a glass of sherry.
- Not a thing, thanks.
- You'll need something to fortify you.
- We'll probably have more singing.
- If I know Monty...
- he'll be right along with us.
- He's just the baritone we've been looking for.
- We really are having a little baritone trouble.
- I say, now,just a moment.
I'll be glad to as soon as I make my report.
- That won't take long.
- Excuse me?
Certainly.
- Doctor, do you mind getting my hat for me?
- Certainly.
- You're not going?
- What's left for me?
- It's baritone or nothing.
- Good night, old boy.
It's nothing.
Pat, you old pirate, why didn't you tell me to change uniforms?
- Why, she's a beauty!
- Tell you? I did tell you.
You didn't tell me anything of the kind.
Those are the things you should tell me.
But you said you wouldn't dandy up for Lily Langtry.
Lily Langtry couldn't hold a candle to her. Get off these boots...
- and get me a clean shirt.
- Yes, sir.
- Come on.
- Yes, sir.
When did she get here?
You didn't even tell me she was young.
- Two days ago, sir.
- And I had to be away on patrol.
Why, she's beautiful.
She's as pretty as a picture.
What the-
Why aren't you in bed?
I'm helping, sir.
Here's your shirt.
00, and regulations for enlisted men are lights-out at 10:00?
- Get.
- Yes, sir.
Good night.
Good night. Run along now.
Here, unbutton that shirt.
You let me go over there looking like a hayseed to meet the most beaut-
Not that I care how I look, but out of respect for her.
I'm sure she'll understand, sir.
You didn't even tell me she had blue eyes. And deep blue eyes at that.!
- dd
- You know, Dad didn't think
I should come, even for a visit.
- But I'm here.
- You might find it a little rugged.
- You know, I've been wondering.
- What?
Well, whatever made a man like you take a job like this?
There are times when it's rather humdrum.
But right now, you're here.
And I'm going to change things.
Inspector Montague, we're going to give a dance on Wednesday night.
- A real one. Dress uniform and frills.
- A dance?
- Well, you do dance, don't you?
- Well, I- Oh, yes. Yes, of course, thank you.
Splendid. And being the only woman in the vicinity, I'm bound to be popular.
Whoa!
- Hello, Chambers.
- Hello, sir.
- Hello, Inspector.
- What's the trouble? Anything wrong?
Indian raid. Four of my workmen wounded.
And they've stolen 20 head of horses.
If we hadn't caught them in time, they'd have cleaned out the whole corral.
- Inspector, turn out 10 men.
- Yes, sir.
- Mr. Randall, you'll take out the patrol.
- Sir.
- Go to the construction camp and track down the raiders.
- Yes, sir.
- I'll need your doctor too.
- Then come inside. We'll get him.
- Call the doctor.
- Harlan.!
Why, Vicky, what on earth are you doing here?
- Came out for a visit.
- Well, why didn't you let me know you were coming?
I didn't even let Dad know I was coming, did I?
No. As a matter of fact, she didn't. Oh, Doctor.
- Yes, sir.
- Go back to camp with Mr. Chambers.
- You're needed there.
- I'll get my kit, sir.
- Mr. Churchill, check the guard.
Prepare for any emergency.
- Yes, sir.
- You may be able to assist him, Mr. Williams?
- Yes, sir.
- Good night, Miss Standing.
- Good night. Anything serious, Dad?
- Good night.
-Just a little Indian trouble at my camp.
- Nothing for you to worry about.
- It's hardly the best time... for you to have come out here, but I can't tell you how pleased I am to see you.
Don't tell me I leave you speechless, Harlan.
You always did. Superintendent, why didn't you give me notice?
I'd have met her at Winnipeg and brought her out here on a special.
You didn't give the Canadian Pacific a chance.
We'll see what can be done about that in the future.
- You bet we will.
- The patrol's ready, Mr. Chambers.
Thank you. I'll be back for a real visit as soon we've settled with these horse thieves.
- Good night.
- Good night and good luck.
Thanks. We need it.
Thank you, Superintendent.
- Not at all. Good night.
- Good night.
Probably the same band that attacked the wagon train, sir.
This will give the railroad people another opportunity to clamor for government troops.
I hope not, sir.
We'll try a direct hit.
I wanna get Big Eagle in here for a talk.
It's only a three-hour ride to his camp.
- If you like, I'll have him here in the morning.
- Good.
- Good night, sir.
- Good night. dd dd
Good mornin'.
You're up mighty early.
- Mr. Monty hasn't come home yet, has he?
- He has not.
- Where did he go?
- On duty.
- Where else would he be goin'?
- When will he get back?
I not be knowin' that.
- What are you making?
- Never mind now. Never mind.
Curiosity killed the cat, you know.
You shouldn't be sewing.
That's a woman's work.
Not in the army, darlin'.
That's where I learned it.
You men on the fort should have wives to do things for you.
Wives, is it?
Heaven pity the poor girl that'd marry a man in this outfit.
- Why?
- 'Tis a no-good lot of heartbreakers, they are.
- Are you a heartbreaker?
- Well, I've had me day.
Of course, I did have certain disadvantages in the way of a face, but-
Hold your hush now.
Stop your questions till I get this last button sewed on.
- Is Mr. Monty a heartbreaker too?
- Isn't he, though?
You oughta seen him at Regina when he was there.
Who was he talking about last night when he said she was so beautiful?
- And who'd be askin'?
- Oh, I was just wondering.
You know very well who he was talking about.
But don't you bother.
She'll be goin' home soon.
We'll have Mr. Monty all to ourselves.
There.
It's finished.
- And I hope it fits ya.
- Is it for me?
And who else would I be sewin' for all this night?
And there's these to go with it.
- I be makin' ya other things when I get around to it.
- Oh!
Now I'm goin' to the mess hall to get you some breakfast.
Thank you, Mr. Pat!
Thank you!
That's all right, darlin'.
That's all right.
What are those Indians coming here for?
Don't worry. They won't hurt you while you're with us.
- Mr. Monty's bringin' 'em in for a powwow.
- Oh.
Come along now.
He looks all right though, doesn't he?
Of course he's all right.
Come on. Inside with ya.
"The sun has shone on us many days in peace, my brothers.
Now a cloud passes over the sun.
Two days ago, a wagon train was destroyed.
Last night, the Iron Horse camp was attacked and many horses stolen.''
Indians who kill wagon train steal horses... not from camp of Big Eagle.
They were Blackfeet.
But if you mean, Wolf Pelt... that they were from some other part of your tribe... that does not lessen the responsibility of your chief.
If Blackfeet Indian make trouble... we'll send guilty ones to white chief.
- I'll hold you to that.
- Give word.
I believe that, Big Eagle.
And I'm willing to admit that these raids may have occurred without your knowledge.
But so that we shall have a clear understanding in the future...
I have prepared a paper, a fair and honorable bond... between the white and the red man.
We'll speak in council with my chiefs.
And I'll expect your answer within five days.
In the meantime,
I'll need some guarantee... that you'll keep your warriors in check.
Huh?
The white chief means he has great responsibility to the queen mother.
He must have some token- the guns of your young braves or your running horses- to prove that you'll keep your promise.
Huh.
If white chief think Big Eagle speak with forked tongue... will give something more close to heart.
Little Chief stay here.
Token Big Eagle's word is straight.
That's more than I'd ask for... but it will do no harm for your son to learn the ways of the white man.
And you may be sure he'll have the best treatment that we can offer.
Go now.
Send word soon.
- The Indians are coming out.
- Oh?
What do you suppose they were doing in there?
Probably gettin' blue blazes from the O.C. for the devilry they've been up to.
There's something
I'd like to tell them too.
Where ya goin'?
Come back here. Come back here!
Are you the chief Indian?
Hmm.
Me Big Eagle.
Well, I certainly hope Mr. Standing is going to make you Indians behave from now on.
And if you got what you deserved, he'd send you all to jail.
That's where you belong for what you've been doing. What right have you-
Here,just a minute, Sue.
You must forgive her, Big Eagle.
This little girl was the only survivor of the wagon train.
Golden Hawk, little spirit of the sun.
Big Eagle sorry you have trouble.
Will not happen again.
I don't see why you want to fight the white people anrway.
They haven't done anything to hurt you.
Will send present to little Golden Hawk.
We be good friend now.
- Do you really think he's sorry?
- Yes, I'm sure he is.
But where did you get all this? Mmm!
That's quite an outfit.
You're a regular cowboy.
- Isn't it beautiful?
- Mmm.
- Mr. Pat made it.
- Monty?
- Yes, sir.
- I'll turn Little Chief over to you.
- Arrange for his care, will you?
- Very good, sir.
Well, so, this is the little girl you spoke of.
Yes, sir.
This is our other guest, Sue Sheldon.
- This is Superintendent Standing, Sue.
- How do you do, sir?
How do you do, Sue? I hope you'll enjoy your stay here with us... until we can find a home for you.
Now, you go with Inspector Montague,
Little Chief. That's right.
Mr. Monty, is he gonna send me away?
Oh, we won't worry about that now.
We'll need you to help entertain Little Chief.
I'll go see about quarters for you, son, while you two get acquainted.
It's very nice weather we're having, isn't it?
Uh.
" Uh''?
Is that your pony?
I guess Indians learn to ride when they're babies, don't they?
I suppose you don't understand English... so there's no use my talking to you.
You're wonderful.
I mean, you're a wonderful rider.
- Squaw ride?
- Well, I, um-
Oh, you think I'm a freak, do you?
Come on.
Help me on.
Well, aren't you going to help me?
Brave never help squaw.
You're not very polite, are you?
All right.
I'll get on by myself.
Oh!
Well, I could get on if I had enough time.
You never ride horse.
You just papoose.
Papoose?
Don't you ever call me that again!
Stop grunting at me!
And you apologize too!
- Papoose.
- Ooh!
Ooh!
Where's Little Chief?
Didn't he wanna play?
Mr. Monty, do you know what he called me?
A papoose!
That's Indian for " baby,'' isn't it?
- I'm afraid it is.
- I thought so.
- Excuse me.
- Wait a minute, Sue. Come here.
Come on. Sit down.
Let's talk this thing over.
I'm sure Little Chief didn't mean to be rude.
Indians always treat their women with a superior air.
- The women seem to like it.
- Well, I don't.
You know, even if he liked you a lot, he'd act just the same.
You see, we're supposed to be much more grown-up than they are.
There are some things you just can't put up with.
Papoose!
But, uh, it's our job to understand them and make allowances.
Would you like me to make allowances for him?
He's our guest.
So, if you two had a little spat...
I think you oughta make a treaty and smoke the pipe of peace.
All right.
I'll try.
I'll give him one more chance.
- But only for your sake.
- That's right. For my sake.
I doubt if I can do much with him though.
I've come to make allowances.
I didn't ever expect to speak to you again.
But Mr. Monty says
I'm much more grown-up than you are... and I should try to understand you.
- So we'll smoke the pipe of peace.
- White squaw smoke?
Well, I, uh-
I never have.
But we're going to make a peace treaty, and you have to smoke on that, don't you?
I guess that means yes.
So how do we start?
Thank you.
I only hope I've got enough allowances to hold out.
Now, the first part of our treaty is that you're to stop pushing me.
You're not to be rude anymore.
- I mean, uh, any ruder than an Indian can't help being.
And the second is that you teach me to ride as well as you do.
- Much work.
- There you go.
- Are you going to make a treaty, or aren't you?
- Make treaty.
And the third part is that you're not to call me " papoose'' again.
Do you hear?
Does that mean yes?
Can't you stop grunting? Say yes when you mean yes, and no when you mean no!
Now, do you understand that?
What's the use?
I guess you mean yes.
Well, I can't think of anything else just now, so we'd better smoke on it.
I expect you'd better light it.
Here.
Now squaw smoke.
It isn't bad!
Anybody can make a treaty like this.
Oh, dear.
Must find Indians who raid wagon train... and steal from
Iron Horse camp... so redcoat chief know we speak with straight tongue.
Think ones who make war on white man... are from camp of Lone Buffalo.
Huh? Why you think that?
Know they make medicine to sun god for war two moons ago.
I go find out if they ones who do it.
All right.
You go.
If find guilty ones, take to redcoat chief... so he know Big Eagle keep word and speak truth.
Mmm. dd
- Get me a handkerchief.
- Yes, sir. dd
You look, uh, very nice.
Thank you, Sue.
- How do you think I look?
- You look very nice t-
Mm-mm! Where did you get that dress?
- Mr. Pat bought it for me.
- Well, well. Good for Pat.
Thank you, sir.
It would be a nice dress to go to a party in, wouldn't it?
-You'd be the belle of the ball.
-If I was invited to a party.
Glory be. Where in heaven's name are they?
- Now what's the matter?
- Your handkerchiefs, sir.
I put 'em in the top drawer here where they're always put, but there's never a one of'em.
Oh, the handkerchiefs!
You had them in with Mr. Monty's shaving thing, so I changed them.
I put the shirts in where the socks used to be, and I put the socks in with the underwear... where the nightshirts used to be, and I put the nightshirts in with the sheets.
- But where did you put the handkerchiefs?
- In with the socks.
And it's taken me two years to educate himself where to put his hands on things.
- I was only trying to help.
- Ohh!
What are you doing?
Give me that!
It's only a piece of old buffalo skin I've been using to rub up Mr. Monty's boots.
- Ohh!
- Why, Sue, that's Pat's pride and joy.
- It's his toupee.
- Toupee?
- Sure. Show her, Pat.
- Yes, sir.
Oh, no. Put it on.
Oh, it's your hair.
I'm awfully sorry.
I didn't know.
It makes you look so handsome.
You oughta wear it all the time.
Oh, yes.
He's a lady-killer with that on.
He wears it on leave, and uses it to fool the redskins too, don't you?
Yes, sir.
If any of them comes after me... it's the toupee he'll get and not me scalp, I hope.
- Your handkerchief, sir.
- You'd better get another one.
- You'll need two for dancing.
- Two? Why?
An extra one to hold against the lady's back.
Faith and help. She's right, sir.
I'll get you another one.
You seem to know a lot about dancing, Sue.
I do. My grandfather was a wonderful fiddler.
- I learned how to dance from him.
- Here you are, sir.
Sue, come here.
Sue, uh, between you and me,
I'm in an awful hole tonight.
- I don't know the first thing about dancing.
- Oh, I can teach you.
I'll go with you to the party, and you can dance with me until you learn.
Mm-mmm. That wouldn't be so good, because they might catch on.
Besides, it'd keep you up too late.
Couldn't you show me right here?
Yes. But it would be better if I went with you so we'd have music.
- I can whistle.
- Well, what dance will we start with?
Well, uh-
Why, is there more than one?
Of course. The waltz, the schottische, the two-step, the polka-
Whoa. We'll just concentrate on one.
That, uh-That waltz sounds familiar.
How does it go?
Come on.
I'll show you.
Now, put your arm around me, like this.
- Wait a minute. I want my handkerchief.
- That's very important.
- Now, give me your other hand.
- Like this?
- Yes. You start with your left foot.
- Left foot. All right.
- You ready?
- Yeah.
One, two, three.
One, two, three.
-Just glide on easy. One-
- One, two, three. Oh!
- The main thing is to dance very smoothly.
- Uh-huh.
Here. Try this.
Now, stoop down.
Don't let it fall. That's the way they teach you in dancing school.
I don't know.
I hope I can keep it up there.
You can.
Now, let's try it again.
One, two, three.
One, two, three.
You're doing much better.
One, two, three. That's fine.
Just glide along like you were rippling over water. Oh!
Oh! We sort of went overboard, didn't we?
You're getting a little mixed up with your feet.
Maybe I'd better show you how it goes first, and then we can dance together.
- Maybe that would be better.
- Now watch me. dd dd
Now with me. dd dd dd
- dd
- dd dd
You must be very fond of that piece.
They've played it every time we've danced.
Well, uh, the boys know it's my favorite.
That's the music
I learned to waltz to.
- I see.
- I can remember it just as though it were tonight. dd
Time Little Squaw go sleep.
I guess if everybody else can stay up dancing, I can stay up and watch them.
- Redcoat make her his squaw?
- He will not!
Funny. Dance like that and not make her his squaw.
He's only doing that to be nice to her.
Indian dance better.
Use feathers.
- Oh, let me try it on!
- No. Only brave wear feathers.
- Well, I've got one anrway.
- Mmm.
- Where did you get all these things?
- Warrior bring.
Bring teepee too.
Little Chief no sleep white man house.
You could sleep anrwhere if you were tired enough.
Mmm. Forgot.
My father sent pony. Present for you.
A pony for me?
Where is it? Show me!
- Aren't you coming?
- Brave always go first.
Squaw walk behind.
Walk behind?
I will not!
Then brave not go.
If we hadn't made a peace treaty-
Well, all right.
But this is just about the last of my allowances.
Mmm.
All I can say is that if Indian women put up... with being treated like this, they must be-
Squaw keep quiet and walk behind brave. dd
- Make mine a two-step, boys.
- Give me a minute, Harlan.
- I'd like a glass of water.
- I'll get it.
Thank you.
- Now we'll have him back on our hands.
- Why not?
- Making three a crowd, aren't you?
- Everyone's my crowd tonight.
You know, with all this attention,
I'm beginning to appreciate... the advantages of being a pioneer woman.
That's great while the fun lasts, Vicky.
But you won't feel that way when the going gets rough.
That's bound to happen out here, you know.
And you think I couldn't stand up to it if it did?
I know you couldn't.
Look, will you tell me why everybody wants to rush me back to Toronto?
Well, I was really thinking of myself.
You see, we'll be stopping construction soon because of the snow.
And, naturally, I'd like you there when I go back home for the holidays.
But suppose I have other plans?
I might decide to become a pioneer woman at that.
- Don't you think I could, Mr. Montague?
- Beg pardon, Miss Vicky?
Don't you think I could become a pioneer woman?
I'm sure you could... if you set your mind to it.
There you are.
That's one vote for me. dd
Isn't that a tom-tom? It's getting closer.
You stay here, Vicky. dd
- What was it?
- Sue and Little Chief are on the warpath. dd
No more dance. Squaw laugh.
I'm awfully sorry. Honest.
I won't do it anymore.
Please don't stop dancing.
We're enjoying it.
Maybe one day you'll teach me an Indian dance.
Isn't he rude?
These Indians certainly are a problem.
You don't seem to have much difficulty handling Little Chief.
It took time for me to understand him.
But it was worth it, because I expect to be here for a long time.
- Really?
- Yes. But it wouldn't be worthwhile... for you to go to all that trouble, because you're going home soon.
- Am I?
- Aren't you?
Mr. Pat said you were.
And I'm sure you wouldn't...
- like it out here anrway, because it's full of-
- Sue.
- Good night.
- Good night.
I'll wait up for you. You'll need someone to put your clothes away.
And if someone is up when I get there, they'll be off to bed with a slipper.
Come on.
Kiss me good night.
- Now what do you say?
- See you first thing in the morning.
- Good night, Sue.
- Good night, Mr. Monty.
I hope you're not offended.
She's a very strange child.
Strange?
I don't think so.
- She adores you.
- Hmm?
It's just that you're slow to notice things like that.
- Perhaps.
- I say, are we men supposed to dance with each other?
Come on.
What's the matter now?
You have a face as long as the old woman that kissed the cow.
- He's in love with her.
- Me darlin'.
'Tis one of the delightful misfortunes that overtakes the male of the species.
'Tis me that knows.
I wish she'd go back where she came from.
Oh-ho.
'Tis jealous, you are.
I am not. But she couldn't take care of him the way we do.
I'll bet she couldn't even make his bed.
- And you're not doing it right either.
- I'm not, ain't I?
You haven't the covers up close enough around his neck.
- Oh. Huh.
- And you should unfold his nightshirt... and have it all laid out for him.
What are you tryin' to do, spoil him?
Here, me bucko, I'll take that.
Oh, Mr. Pat! And I taught him how to dance with her.
Heaven help us.
I know, I know.
'Tis a terrible thing to be a woman in love.
- Oh, Mr. Pat!
- Ah, yes, I understand.
Never you mind.
Never you mind now.
And it's a heartbreaking ruffian he is.
He is not a ruffian.
I won't let you say that.
Oh, well, have it your own way, me darlin'.
Have it your own way.
Close them pretty eyes now. dd
Good night, Miss Standing.
It's the jolliest night we've ever had.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Certainly a lovely party.
- What's this?
Chief Big Eagle say here bad Indians who make trouble for covered wagon... and steal horses from Iron Horse camp.
He send to you.
Show redcoat he keep word.
Take them to the guardroom.
- This fellow's dead, sir. He's been stabbed.
- They're all dead, sir.
Order out a detail to bury them.
Well, this looks as if Big Eagle is showing his defiance.
He knows the dispensing of justice belongs to the Mounted Police.
I'll take that up with him when he comes to sign the treaty.
If it's ever signed.
Chambers, if I should decide to send Vicky home... could you do anything for me in the way of transportation?
I certainly could, sir. There's a supply train up on Sunday morning... that'll take her as far as Winnipeg.
From there, she can connect with the Eastern Limited.
I agree with you. It'd be wise to get her away from here.
- I'll let you know.
- No, thanks. I won't come in now.
I better get back to the camp to see that everything's all right then.
- Good night.
- Good night, Chambers.
Won't you eat your eggs, sir?
They're that fresh...
I just saw the cook take them from under the hen with his own hands.
Oh, no, thanks.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Here's your baked apple and milk.
All ready for you.
- I'm not hungry this morning, thank you.
- Heaven help us.
There's more than one sufferin' from the same complaint this morning, I'm thinking.
Well, I'll get a bit of work done. Sir?
Hmm? Oh, yes.
Go ahead.
Was it a nice party?
Yes, very nice.
Is she a good dancer?
Very good.
- Better than I am?
- No, I wouldn't say that.
- Are you going to marry her?
- Marry her?
Well, I was watching you dance together last night.
And the way she looked at you, and the way you looked at her, I thought maybe-
Don't you think you ought to have your breakfast?
Yes, sir. But I supposed that when people were in love, they always got married.
She's going home tomorrow.
Even Little Chief-
- She is? She's really going home?
- Mm-hmm.
Oh, isn't that a shame? Won't you sit over here in the rocking chair?
- It's much more comfortable.
- No, thanks.
I'll get you your pipe.
Would you like your pipe?
Here's-
Here's some matches too.
I guess you smoke more matches than you do tobacco. Can I get you anything else?
No, thanks. You'd better run along and play with Little Chief.
- If you need me for anything,just send Mr. Pat.
- I will.
Hello, Mr. Pat!
Hello, Mr. Pat! Hello!
- Hello!
- Hello, Susannah.
- Hi, Carruthers.
- Good morning.
Oh, good morning, Miss Vicky.
I was hoping I'd see you before you left.
I'm sorry we have to say good-bye, but Dad isn't in favor of my becoming a pioneer woman.
He's right, Miss Vicky.
This really isn't the place for you.
Are you going to keep it a man's country forever?
It's apt to be that way for quite a while yet.
Well, I suppose if we're ever to see each other again, you'll have to come to Toronto.
I'm afraid there's not much chance of that.
- Why?
- We'll be pushing farther west every year... and by the time I get back to Toronto, you'll probably be married...
- and have a family of grown-up children.
- And what about you?
Oh, I guess I'll just end up being the old man of the mountain.
Well, good-bye.
I'll always remember the fun we've had... and I'll probably find myself wishing I could hear you sing that little waltz song again.
And I'll find myself wishing it wasn't so far to Toronto.
Good-bye, Vicky.
Squaw ride faster!
I'm coming as fast as I can!
- Squaw ride like-
- Don't you dare say it!
- White man buy?
- Take your time.
If they're sound, we'll make a deal.
What are they doing over there?
Wolf Pelt sell horses to railroad.
Let's go watch.
Come on.
Oh, all right!
Go ahead.
I'm getting used to being a squaw.
Aah! No have to look.
How much pay?
- We'll settle that later.
- You'll buy now. All good horses.
Sure. Three of them's very good horses.
They oughta be.
They're three that were stolen in the raid and wasn't brought back with the others.
White man lie.
Indian ponies.
Yeah? Well, there's Bully Boy... that's LadyJane, and there's Steamboat.
And I'll prove it.
They didn't even make a good job of dyeing it!
More of your thieving tricks.
I wouldn't do business with your breed if I had to go without horses!
You leave those animals here and clear out.
- White man pay.
- I'll give you nothing.
If you got what you deserve,
I'd take it out of your hide.!
- Let us handle him, boss.
- We'll take care of him.
- Wait a minute.!
- You've been babied by the redcoats long enough... but you're at the end of the rope with me.
I'm going to have the railroad bring out government troops to deal with you.
Iron Horse bring soldiers?
Yes, plenty of them.
They'll keep you in order... with bullets.
All right.
White chief has spoken.
Don't let 'em get away!
Hold him up.! Get him.!
- Hang him.!
- Hang him.!
- Hang him.!
You kids better clear out.
This is no place for you.
- White man no right beat Indian.
- Run along before you get hurt.
Come on, Little Chief.
Natosi, sun god, not answer.
Three suns pass since talk to redcoat chief.
He wait for our answer.
Natosi turn face away from our medicine.
My fathers, see what white men have done to your children.
This is what they do when go their camp in friendship.
- Take them to squaw.
- White man's words are sweet, but heart bitter.
- Who has done this, my son?
- Men who make trail for Iron Horse.
And now their chief has spoken. Iron Horse soon bring soldiers, kill our people!
Will we wait while white warriors come like locusts?
Drive off people from land like buffalo?
I say not listen redcoat chief who talk peace and give us lies on paper... who take your son and call himself your brother.!
I say make war while able!
- Destroy trail of Iron Horse.!
-dd
Drive out white men!
All white men!
Medicine answered.
Natosi angered. Natosi say war. dd dd dd dd
It looks like war on a big scale.
The signal fires are burning... and the tribes are gathering from every part of the west.
Mr. Monty! Mr. Monty, I'm so glad you're back! I was so worried.
- You shouldn't be up this late, Sue.
- But I had to tell you.
Little Chief said the Indians are going to kill all the white men in redcoats... because of what happened at the railroad camp.
- At the railroad camp?
- What happened, Sue?
The Indians tried to sell Mr. Chambers his own horses back.
He got so mad, because they were trying to cheat him... he said he was gonna bring soldiers out to make them behave.
The Indians didn't like that.
When they tried to leave... the workmen pulled them off their horses and started hitting them.
I can try to reach Big Eagle and explain that he has nothing to fear from Chambers's threats.
I'm afraid it's too late for talk now.
- What is it, Father? More trouble?
- Yes, Vicky. Plenty.
And our friend Chambers started it.
Let's take a look from the tower. dd
- Now squaw put out finger.
- And let you cut it? I will not.
- Squaw afraid?
- Well, no.
Oh, you did!
It's bleeding!
Now put together.
Make Golden Hawk and Little Chief blood brothers.
You mean this will make me an Indian?
Mm. Indian now.
- Will my face turn red?
- No. You stay paleface.
I'm glad of that.
Oh, but if I'm a member of your tribe... they'll all be my relations, won't they?
Not Wolf Pelt.
He bad Indian.
- Him steal horses from white man camp.
- He did?
Then why didn't your father send him to Mr. Standing, like he did the others?
Father not know.
Wolf Pelt lie.
Say he not one of them.
Other Indians not tell.
- Well, I'm going to tell.
- You belong to tribe now. Must keep secret.
- But he should be punished.
- We catch him Wolf Pelt right time.
Not tell now.
We put in treaty.
Oh, dear.
Come on! Get ready!
They're coming this way! Hurry up!
Come on!
- Superintendent in?
- Yes, sir.
- What's happened?
- Our camp was raided.
We had to fight our way out.
I told you weeks ago that you couldn't keep order in this territory without troops.
Now we're trapped. The tracks are torn up behind us, and the bridge is burned.
The telegraph lines are down. They probably killed half the men in my camp by now.
Mount a detachment to go to their aid.
Bring the workmen here if the situation warrants and have Churchill take charge.
- Yes, sir.
- The few men you send won't stop
2,000 bloodthirsty savages.
We wouldn't be facing this situation,
Mr. Chambers... if it weren't for your unreasonable conduct.
- My unreasonable conduct?
- Your presuming on our authority... threatening to bring the militia here to make war on the Indians.
Well, I- Perhaps
I was a little hasty.
You were more than that.
Your stupidity is responsible... for endangering lives and property in my charge.
In the future, keep to the building of your railroad... but leave dealing with the Indians to the mounted police.
Inspector Montague?
Have the gates closed and see that the men are prepared for any emergency.
Yes, sir.
Redcoats go to Iron Horse camp.
Now we get Little Chief.
Sound the alarm! dd
Keep Sue in there, and you stay with her.
All right. Come on.
Vicky, quick!
Inside!
- Here's some more ammunition, Mr. Pat.
- Thank you, darlin'.
Get down. Get down.
Get down.
Get behind me.
Get behind me. That's it.
I got it! I got it!
Here it is.
Thank you.
That's it.
Mr. Pat, I've looked everywhere, and nobody seems to know what's become of Mr. Monty.
Never you mind now.
You've had no rest all night.
Sit down there, and as soon as I finish this, I'll get ya a bit of breakfast.
I couldn't eat. I'd better go back out and keep on looking.
Oh, well-
Sergeant MacGregor, are you all right, sir?
Aye, lassie.
Just a wee nip in the hand.
- Have you seen Mr. Monty?
- Well, no. I can't say that I have.
He isn't in the hospital with the wounded men, the guardroom or the stables.
- I've looked almost every place.
- D'n' worry your head, lassie.
Mr. Monty can take care of himself under any circumstances.
Thank you, sir.
Take him to the stables.
Inspector Randall?
Inspector Randall!
- Yes, Inspector?
- I was taken prisoner while on patrol, sir... and held at Big Eagle's camp.
Just before dawn this morning,
Inspector Montague was brought in.
- I was released to bring you a message.
- Go on.
Big Eagle demands that the railroad leave his territory within two days... or Inspector Montague will not be returned and hostilities will be reopened.
What will you do, Father?
You must send some word.
There's only one answer refusal.
Thank you, Randall.
Mr. Standing, aren't you going to try to save him?
- Of course, Sue.
- Well, there must be some way to rescue him.
There aren't many of us. If we tried and failed, they'd put him to death immediately.
We'll need help. I'll get a message out to the nearest post.
They may get here in time.
Iron Horse still go on.
If don't go away, you die.
Iron Horse won't go away,
Little Chief, not for me or anyone else.
Chief redcoat big fool.
All white men be killed.
If they do, many more will come... and it'll be very bad medicine for the Indians.
Big talk.
Indian kill them too.
- I get cold water for sick head.
- Thanks. That would be a help.
Do it for Golden Hawk.
She your friend.
Too bad you die.
Make her feel sorry.
You know I'm not a very good rider, but you go as fast as you can.
I'll stick on some way.
Hold still.
You oughta know which way the Indian camp is. You used to live there.
Maybe you're thirsty.
Have a drink.
Hurry up.
Oh. Oh, hello.
- Would you please tell me the way to Mr. Big Eagle's camp?
I've gotta go there.
It's terribly, terribly important.
- It's all right for me to go there,
'cause he's a friend.
He gave me this pony.
We know each other very, very well.
Won't you take me to him, please?
Thank you very much.
May I see Mr. Big Eagle now?
- Not now. You stay here.
- But-
Why, Sue!
Oh, Mr. Monty, have they hurt you?
I'm all right, dear.
How did you get here?
I came to see Mr. Big Eagle, but they won't let me talk to him.
- You shouldn't have come.
- I had to.
Mr. Standing sent to another post for help... but they can't get here in time, so after dark tonight... he's coming with a few men to try to rescue you.
But he's afraid that if the Indians see him coming, they'll-
- I have to see Mr. Big Eagle somehow, before it gets dark.
- It won't do any good, Sue.
It will.
I know it will.
- Please, Mr. Indian, won't you let me talk to-
- You go back.
Come over here, dear.
Stay near me.
Oh, Mr. Monty... if they do anything to you, they'll have to kill me too. dd
Redcoats on way!
They are coming!
Signal say redcoat leave post.
On way here.
Make ready now. dd
You come now.
- Please! What are you going to do?
- Stop it, Wolf Pelt.
- But they can't take you!
- Sue, remember? You promised.
- I'm not crying. Please. Let me go too.
- You'll stay.
Then bring Mr. Big Eagle here so I can talk to him.
Sure. He come.
But not now.
Oh, Mr. Monty-
We're not giving up, you know.
I'll talk to Big Eagle. But now... let's pretend this is just like any other night.
Kiss me good night.
Now, what do you say?
See you first thing... in the morning.
I can't! I can't!
No!
No! Wait! Please! No! No! dd
Mr. Monty. Mr. Monty. I won't let them hurt you.
- Now, Sue.
- No! Don't! Don't! Please!
No! Let me go! Let me go!
Mr. Big Eagle, please.
Don't let them hurt Mr. Monty.
- No listen to white devil child.
- You have to listen to me. Please!
Don't touch Golden Hawk!
She my friend.
I'm your friend too, Mr. Big Eagle, and so are the redcoats.
- That's what I came here to tell you.
- Redcoat no friend now.
Let Iron Horse chief bring soldier to kill all Indians.
No, they won't.
Mr. Standing won't let them.
And you shouldn't hurt Mr. Monty because of what Mr. Chambers said.
I won't let you.
White child lie to save redcoat.
All tribe know soldiers come.
The redcoats are the only ones who can speak for the great queen mother.
- The soldiers will not come to your lands.
- Redcoat lie!
White men beat Indians!
Sun god say kill all white men!
No, you won't! It was all your fault anrway!
You deserve to be whipped! If you hadn't tried to cheat Mr. Chambers when you-
Right time now.
You tell.
The only reason Mr. Chambers said he'd bring out the soldiers... was because Wolf Pelt tried to sell him back the horses he had stolen from the railroad.
Not true. No listen.
Devil child have forked tongue.
Golden Hawk speaks straight.
You one who lead braves who steal horses and let others take blame.
Little Chief lie too. Since live with white man, he have forked tongue.
Stop!
Why you not tell redcoat about Wolf Pelt?
Because Little Chief and I made a treaty to keep it a secret... so I couldn't break my word, could I?
You make treaty with Golden Hawk?
Yes.
Make her blood brother too.
No make treaty now.
Too much talk.
- All lies.!
- Wait!
I've told you the truth,
Mr. Big Eagle.
Honest, I have.
On my word of honor.
Little Chief give word too.
They try to fool you till redcoats get here.
No wait.
Wolf Pelt tell truth!
Bring medicine. dd
Who lying?
You one who lie.
Take him away!
No! No lie. No.
Devil child lie!
Set free!
Little Golden Hawk show white man and Indian... how to live as brothers.
She smoke too.
Oh, here I go again.
- l hardly have the nerve to look at it.
- l'm sure we have itthis time.
Seems too much to hope for. After all, the experiments are only based on a hunch.
All scientific experiments are based on a hunch.
Backed up with knowledge and effort and patience.
This means a great deal, Boynton. If itworks, it means the Guggenheim Fellowship. l used to dream about going abroad to study.
Heidelberg, Vienna... Magic words, Boynton.
And then l married and had to settle down to being a small-time doctor in a little town. l thought atfirst l might save enough.
Maybe l could have.
- Then the baby came.
- l know. l'm not regrettting anything.
Mywife and Molly are...
Say, l'm a lucky stiff, Boynton.
You knowthat, don'tyou?
Yes, Doctor.
Molly.
- Do you wantto see ifthe cake's done?
-All right.
Now, careful. Don't burn yourself. l won't, Mommy.
- l think so, Mommy.
-All right, let's have a look.
Ooh, that's hot!
- Have a smell.
- Mmm!
We can't go to Heaven's Gate without cake, can we?
- No, darling, we cerrtainly can't.
- l wish you'd let me help you, Mrs Middleton.
This is onlyworkthat Mommy and l can do.
This is a vey special day, Amy.
It only happens twice ayear.
What makes this day any differentfrom any other?
Today's the daythat Molly and l call our May Saturday.
- The other day comes in September.
-We call that our September Saturday.
Anyway, l think l ought to help you with the work.
Thanksjustthe same, Amy. l have help.
Young lady, who do you workfor?
You.
-And who does Mommyworkfor?
- Daddy.
And who does Daddyworkfor?
Forthe butcher and grocer, the tax collector and the telephone company.
Oh, you!
Cottton in your ears from now on atthe dinnertable, young lady.

How's the most beautiful woman in the world?
Justwaiting breathlesslyforthe world's handsomest man to come home.
- It's Daddy.
- That's why l called.
- l won't be able to get home at all today.
- Oh, dear,
You see, l'm right in the middle ofan imporrtant experiment. l don'tthink l'll even make itfor dinner.
But, darling this is May Saturday.
Uh-oh. May Saturday. Couldn'twe possibly put it off until nextweek?
No, dear, we couldn't put it off. l knowthat sounds like a vey selfish wife, but... ttwice ayear l reserve the rightto be selfish and insist upon coming bettween you and yourwork.
- But l'm doing all this foryou and Molly.
- But May Saturday is for Molly, too.
Put her on the phone.
Let me speakto her, will you?
- Daddywants to speakto you, dear.
- Hello, Daddy.
Hello, young lady. Say, would it interestyou if l were to tell you that...
Daddy, Mother's right here, so l have to whisper. Are you listening?
Listen closer.
Now, don'tforgetthe candied ginger.
Now, l don'twantto scold you, Daddy, but Sniffy, Mommy and l have been waiting and waiting foryou to come home. lfyou don't hury, you'll be late.
What?
What did you say, Daddy?
He says thatwe oughtto starrt ahead without him. He's leaving the office right away.
- l'm taking the day off. Imporrtant business.
- Butthe experiment! l said, imporrtant business.
Here comes Daddy!
Here comes Daddy!
- Hello.
- Hello.
Well, how's my sweethearrt?
Here l am, almost as good as new.
- You were almost late, Daddy.
- ''Almost'' neverwon first prize.
- Say, where do you want us to sit?
-As ifyou didn't know!
No, honestly, l've forgottten.
You've forgottten where we sit when we picnic at Heaven's Gate?
Why, Daddy!
- Have you forgottten too, Mommy?
- Mm-hm.
- Do l have to tell you?
-Afraid so.

-All ready. Come on.
Let's get out of'em. l'll getyour shoes.

-All right.
Whoo!
Ooh, it's like a drink of iced water!
Only, on the outside.
Whee!
Ooh, bettterthan a bathtub no mattter ifyou run itfull.
Just once more, Daddy.
It's good exercise.
-Just once more.
- That's enough. It's too cold.
- Should l blow my nose, Daddy?
- Ifyou can getthe crumbs offyou thatway.
There's more cake outside than inside!
- Can l help you, dear?
- No, thanks. This is girls' work.
Good girl.
Our old gate.
You know, Don, we've been awfully happy.
''Been''?. !. l was kind of in hopes thatyou'd still be in love with that county doctor.
You know l am.
And more than ever, too.
-What's on your mind?
- l wasjustthinking ofour early struggle.
-Wasn't any picnic foryou, was it?
- Itwas grand, though.
Our living room was your office and l had to chase prescriptions, hand you instruments.
Emergency calls at all hours!
And my holding the patients' feet as well as their hands.
- How l loved it!
- Molly changed all that, didn't she? l just had to get a regular nurse. l know Miss Boynton's been wonderful but, nowthat Molly's no longer a baby,
- don'tyou thinkthat...
- That l could get along without Boynton? l don't knowjustwhat l'd do, Elsa.
Don, l do wish that...
Thatwhat?
Forget it. l'm just an old married woman with not enough to do.
-All readyforthe picture?
- l don't look vey beautiful after all this work.
You're the best-looking woman here.
Turn the film?
Yes, it's all set.
Get closerto Daddy, Mommy.
Daddy, get closerto Mommy.
- How's that?
- Fine.
Now, look at each other and smile.
Whee!
Don, that man rides like Rolfe Brent!
Why not? It is Rolfe Brent.
Hejust got backfrom Europe a couple ofdays ago.
- Hello there!
-When do we go to Heaven's Gate again?
Notfor a long, long time, Molly.
- Remember me?
- Sure, Brent. l heard you got back.
Mywife recognised you bythe wayyou satyour horse.
How one man sits a horse differently from another, l don't see.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
- Does he have any ponies, Mommy?
- l don't know, dear. l hope we're going to be good neighbours.
-Are you staying on at Brenttwood?
- l've got halfa dozen ofthese youngsters.
- It's a lot ofwork, exercising them.
- How could anyone call thatwork?
Say, why don'tyou ttwo come riding with me sometime?
Mrs Middleton might.
The onlything l ride's that old bus of mine. lt bouncesjust as much and doesn't bite!
- How aboutyou, Mrs Middleton?
- l don'tthink l could.
Ofcourse you could.
You used to be great. Go ahead.
Ofcourse you could.
You just get on him and go.
- Don't let hertake anyjumps till she's all set.
- You can trust me.
May l send my carforyou in the morning?
Aboutten o'clock?
-All right.
- She'd get a big kick out of it.
She doesn'twantto get kicked, Daddy!
- That's fine. So long.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Molly.
- Goodbye, Mr Brent.
Come on.
(wh韘tles) Come on, Sniffy.
Pease porridge hot, pease porridge cold
Pease porridge in the pot, nine days old.

- Eight? Already, Daddy?
Why, it seems no more than half-past seven.
Sniff. Eight o'clock, sir.
Don't pretend you don't know it.
Sniff!
Give him a chance. Maybe he wants to say good nightto his gang.
Do you think l have nothing bettterto do than wait here foryou all night?!
Good night, Doctor. lfany litttle boy or girl gets sick in the night, l prescript milk of magnesia.
Ugh!

Say, how'd your old riding outFit workthis morning? l can just squeeze into it.
Thankyou kindly.
You know, Don l wish you'd rid'e with me or... or something.
Me riding wouldbe something!
- Do you wantthe Jackson case histoy?
- Yes, l'll put it in my case.
The positive results from the cultures mean you'll be able to prove yourtheoy. lf l can, it'll mean awhole newtreatment.
- Don'twory aboutthings while you're away.
-What do you mean?
Oh... l meant aboutthe patients. l'm sure l'll be able to take care ofthem.
- l know l can always count on you.
- Thankyou. Goodbye, and good luck.
Thanks. l'll need it.
- Oh, Don, mustyou go to New York?
- Darling, it's the chance ofa lifetime. l know, and l don'twantto be a bad sporrt, but mustyou go atthis parrticulartime?
What's the mattter, Elsa? l suppose l'm foolish, but l get so bored and lonely justwaiting for an occasional glimpse ofyou.
You poor darling.
It isn't much fun foryou, is it?
Don, take me with you.
Thatwouldn't be anyfun foryou, because l go from hospital to hospital.
- l'd waitforyou.
- Butyou just said...
That's right, l did, didn't l?
Skip it, darling.
You're afunny girl. l suppose l am.
Poor Don, cooped up in that laboratoy with poisonous gases and diphtheria germs. l thought he wentforjust a couple ofdays.
Don forgets time when he's working.
He phoned at noon and said he'd be back aboutfive o'clock.
That's fine!
You can bring him to dinnertonight.
Unless you've had enough ofyour neighbour.
Silly!
- Look, there's afence ahead. Let's take it.
- Let's go.
Whee!
How do you like it, Sniffy?
Daddy!
Daddy! Daddy, wait!
Daddy, wait!
- Hello, Daddy.
-Are you hurrt? l... l think l might have a litttle fever.
-Where's Amy?
- She told me to wait here.
Oh, l see.
Did you miss me much, Daddy?
Cos l did you. l had more to do in New York than go around missing litttle girls.
You're teasing!
Mommy says you spend most ofyourtime missing her, and the rest missing me.
- Don'tyou ever miss Sniff, Daddy?
-Well...
- Not even a litttle?
-A penny's worrth.
Did you and your mother get in any mischief while l was gone? l haven'tthought ofany good mischief.
Mommy's been too busy riding.
Oh. Well, here we go.
Oop!
- Say, where's Sniff? (wh韘tles)
- Sniffy! Here, Sniffy! l'm not expecting a surprise, but ifyou had brought me one, whatwould it be, Daddy?
Well, it might be awhitejacket with a hatto match, with big white butttons.
And then again, it might be a doll.
Ooh! Hury, Daddy. l can'twait.
Might it be both?
Hello, Mommy!
Hello, Mommy!
- Don!
- Hello, Mommy!
Well, Elsa!
- Darling, you've been gone ages!
- Have l? l've missed you, too.
- Oh, Rolfe.
- Hm.

-We've done some grand riding.
We've been taking thejumps like steeplechasers.
How are you, Don? You knowthis girl's a champion horsewoman?
- She's a champion, all right.
- You're bringing herto dinnertonight.
- No excuse this time.

All right.
Whattime do you want us?
- That's great. Make it eight o'clock.

- Goodbye, Mr Brent.
- Bye.
- Goodbye.
-Am l vey mean to take you overto Rolfe's?
- l'll see howyou behave and tell you later. l wish we could do things like other people, without always feeling guilty.
Guilty?! l don'tfeel guilty, l feel swell. l don't care who gets sicktonight.
Are my clothes pressed? l'll see.
- Ow! Mommy! Daddy!
-Wait a minute, darling.
You took a nosedive, huh?
- Here we go. There you are.
- Let me cary 'em.
-All right.
-We'll pile the packages in your arms. lfshe's gonna cary 'em, putthat one up there...
(Elsa_ We were haIFwayto BrooMield bythattime!
- It's a long way.
-And he, the great horseman,
- dismounted and sat on afence to rest!
- l don't blame him. l ride for pleasure, notto prove l can take it.
Could l tell she'd gallop off and leave me there?
She's aptto do most anyything. lt's no compliment thatyou'll risk such a lovely girl with someone as susceptible as l am.
Don'tthink l don'twory about it.
He'd think any girl was marvellous who knew
''bridle'' meant a harness and not awedding. l beg your pardon?
You wouldn't go riding with another man ifyou were mywife.
Well, l ain't, l ain't never gonna be, and l can't ride a horse anyyway.
Here, hold this and don't be such a gossip.
You know, Don, l have too much time to play and maybe you haven't enough.
No, l have all l want.
Elsa can represent me in the sporrting world. lf l had such a charming representative, l'd retire to the sidelines, too.
You playboys are the ones who are on the sidelines.
- (woman) l must see the doctor.
- He's dining, Miss.
- Tell him l'm here.
- l can't disturb him. lfyou don't call him, l'm afraid l'll have to...
- It's the Stevens' case. An emergency.
- Bring a kit?
- Yes.
- Good. l'm afraid you'll have to excuse me.
Let me come. l can keep the other Stevenses out ofthe room.
No, you finish your dinner.
Boynton can handle this.
- Butyou may be late.
- Rolfe will be kind enough to see you home.
- You mean, luckky enough.
- Good night.
-Well, l seem to be on your hands.
- Do you mind? l can stand it. For a litttle while.
Poor Don. Is he always being called away like this?
Doesn't he ever getto finish a meal? l think he had desserrt once lastyear.
Sweet enough.
Yourtechnique is perrfect, Rolfe.
Hury and drink up so l can keep in practice. lt's too hot. The coffee, l mean.
Oh. (chuckles)
Whatwould yourfirst move be if itweren'tforthe coffee?
Well, l'd showyou some etchings.
But l haven't any etchings.
Tsk, tsk, tsk. Bad.
Leaves you helpless, doesn't it? lt's a great handicap.
How about awalk in the garden?
- Too trite.
- But always good!
- Fool!
- You're a darling.
Whoa! l may be spoiling eveything, but l can't keep up the pretence. l want so much to...
- Go ahead. l'm not afraid.
- Elsa, you must knowthat l... l know. l'm veyfond ofyou, too, Rolfe.
We're both nice, civilised people.
Should l exclaim, ''Sir, how dare you''?
You see, l'm not afraid.
- l just know l haven't been mistaken in you.
- You're pre_ swell.
Now, aboutthis husband ofyours. Don'tyou thinkwe could teach him to be silly, like us? l suppose you realise not one in a hundred could have handled that.
- l thinkwe saved the peritonitis.
- ''We''?! Yousaved it.
- Thejob needed us both, Boynton.
- l wish you wouldn't call me that.
-Why not?
- Because l've got a name, you know. It's Sara.
All right, Sara. Good night. Don't let me forget to fill outthat reporrt in the morning.
Remind me, will you, Boynton?
- Yes, Doctor.
- Good night.
MoIJy) Is thatyou, Daddy?
- You'll di_ my covers, Daddy.
- l beg your pardon, young lady. Here.
Bythe way, young lady, what are you doing awake atthis hour ofthe night? l guess Sniffy must have woken me up.
Ooh! What's in the box?
That's Mommy's surprise.
Oh-oh-oh-oh! lf l letyou see it, will you go rightto sleep?
- l promise.
-All right.
MoIJyg韌gles)
Ooh! That's a nice surprise.
You bet it is. We're not gonna have our
Mommy shown up bythis horsy crowd.
- Now, good night, young lady.
- Night.
- You go rightto sleep.
-All right.
Daddy! l can sleep quicker ifyou leave the door open.
All right, sleep quicker.
Thanks for bringing me home, Rolfe.
You're riding with me in the morning.

You're a dear. It's been wonderrful.
Thanks for a perrfect evening.
- Don, you're home!
- Uh-huh.
They're simply swell! l mean, l didn't parrticularly care for thatfarewell speech you just made to Brent.
Now, don't saythings you'll be soryfor.
- You're tired.
- Yes.
(Elsa_ l will not be questioned like this!
- (Don) Why are you so excited, then?
- (Elsa) l'm not excited.
Eitheryou trust me, darling, oryou don't - no mattterwho the man is!
What's the mattter, sweethearrt?
Can'tyou sleep? l'vejust had a bad dream, Mommy.
Have you, dear? Well, so have l.
Let's go to sleep again and see if we can't have a sweet one this time.

-What do you mean?
- You have dinner evey night, don'tyou?
- l mean with Daddy and Mommy, like before.
Oh, l don't know.
-Anyyway, it's none of my business.
- Is it any of my business? lfthose people would only go away and leave 'em alone, eveything'd be all right.
Nowwill you get out of myway, Miss?

Well! What's wrong? l don't like to be picked up.
Except by my daddy.
But he's not herejust now.
Won't l do?
- You don't know how a daddy does.
- l could learn. lt's vey hard to learn, sir.
Let's have aty. Let's pretend that l'm the daddy and you're the litttle girl.
- l amthe litttle girl.
-All right! We'rejust pretending.
Now, here l come!
Nowthen you give m' e an account ofyourself.
Any cuts, pains, bumps?
That's not like a daddy.
- No? Why not?
- You were laughing.
You're supposed to laugh inside, but ifyou laugh outside, that spoils it.
(laugh韓g) Oh, Molly!
Why don'tyou like me, Molly? l like you. l like you and your mother and your daddy. l don't care. We don't like you.
We wish you'd go away and never come back.
Who is ''we'', Molly? Your mother?
Are you sure?
(cardr韄es o_
- l told him, Amy.
-Who? What?
- l told Mr Brentwhatyou said.
-Whatlsaid?!
About Mommy and Daddy and me wishing he'd go away and never come back.
What? To his face?!
Look here, you're going to get into trouble forthat.
Don'tyou sayltold you to!
- Butyou said...
- l said nothing about it, understand?
- Is itthe worstthing l've ever done, Amy?
- Yes, l think maybe it is.
-Will Mommy spank me?
- Yes, l think maybe she will.
-Will Daddy? He never has.
-Well, maybe hewon't.
Notfor anyything you said to Mr Brent.
Hello?
Yes. Hello, Elsa.
Why... why, no. Something just came up, and l... l'm going away.

Butwhere on earrth did you getthat idea?
Has Don been talking to you?
He has. l know he has.
Rolfe!
(Don) Boynton.

- Yes.
Boynton!
Why aren'tyou here when l need you? l don't know, Don. l knowyou need me.
And l need you, too. l came to see ifsomething can be done about it.
- It's entirely up to you.
- Oh, Don, let's stop this.
Let's not quarrel any more.
When l leftthe house l was furious because ofyour interrference.
- Interrference?
- There's no need to pretend. l knowyou asked Rolfe notto see me any more. l asked Rolfe notto...?!
Say, if he told you that, he's lying.
- Don, that's nottrue.
- Look, l'm terribly busy. l don'twantto argue with you. l'm in the last stage ofa vey imporrtant experiment.
Experiment?
Boynton!
What's the mattter, Mommy? Hm?
Oh... l've been naughtytoday, Mommy.
Worserthan l've ever been before.
Have you, dear?
Shall l go upstairs and waitforyou to come?
No, darling, ofcourse not.
Why, what on earrth have you done?
This morning l told Mr Brent we didn't like him.
Thatwasn't vey kind, was it?
No. And l told him we wished he'd go away and never come back.
Butthat's nottrue, Molly.
(s韌hs) So now l'll go upstairs.
No, darling.
Mother doesn'twantto spankyou. l'm sure you're sory about Mr Brent, aren'tyou?
Well... l'm vey sory, Mommy.
(Don) What are you doing here? l thoughtyou mightwant me.
No, go on home.
-Won'tyou talkto me, Doctor?
-What is there to talk about? l'm amused, Boynton.
Believe it nor not, l'm amused.
What's thejoke?
This. Months ago itwould have meant eveything in the world to me.
- The fellowship! Congratulations...
- Yes, that's swell, isn't it? l'm going to talkto you not as your nurse, but as afriend.
- It's notworrthy ofyou to actthis way.
- Don't interrfere.
''Don't interrfere''?! You expect me to stand by idlywhile you ruin your life?
Why do you stand forwhat's going on bettween Elsa and Brent?
-What right have you to tell me...
-What right?
Because l love you. l'm sory. l shouldn't have spoken.
Mommy, l thought l heard Daddy's car, but itwent right by.
So you had to come downstairs and tell Mommy all about it, didn'tyou?
Yes, Mommy. l thoughtyou mightwantto know.
Thankyou. Here, you'd bettter put on
Mommy's wrap. You mustn't catch cold.
Then you can put Sniffoutfor a moment, and then the ttwo ofyou, hop up to bed again.
Mm! My baby.
- There we go.
- Molly.
- l wantto askyou something.
- Yes?
-Would you like to call me Uncle Rolfe?
- No, thankyou.
Well, l don't care forthat
''uncle'' stuffeither, Molly.
How aboutjust calling me Rolfe, then?
But... can'twejusttalk, without my calling you anyything, sir?
Afraid not, Molly. You see, you're coming to live at my house pre_ soon.
How can you live in anybody's house butyour own?
But itwill be your own.
- He's teasing, Mommy.
- No, Molly, he's notteasing.
-And you shall have all new playythings.
- But l like my old playythings.
- You can bring them, too.
- Don't. There must be a bettterwaythan this.
But if Mother asks you?
Molly, you'll have your own pony.
A brown-and-white pony.
A pony?
A pony! l'm going to have a pony.
-And will you come too, Mommy?
- Ofcourse, darling.
And Daddy?
Not Daddy? l was onlyteasing, Mr Brent, sir.
Cos l really don'twant a pony. l've got a dog.
Molly.
Now, l wantyou to listen vey carefully.
You won't understand perhaps until you're a big girl, but l wantyou to tyto remember, ifyou can.
Mother's going awayfor awhile. When she comes back she won't be married to Daddy.
-Who will you be married to, Mommy?
-Well... soon l'll be married to Mr Brent.
And then we'll go and live in his house.
And who will Daddy be married to? l don't know, dear.
Well, maybe if l growed like aweed, l could mary Daddy.
Let's nottalk about it any more.
Now run along.
The Denforrths are expecting us on Friday.
They're giving a pa_ before the horse show. l don't see how l can possibly leave before Saturday night, Rolfe.
Course not, Mommy!
You remembered, didn'tyou? lt's my September Saturday. lt's the daywe all go to Heaven's Gate.
We take our lunch. l take cake. lt's a picnic - justthe three of us, ttwice ayear.
Butyou're nottelling itto him right, Mommy. lt's Heaven's Gate, and it's always the Saturday Daddyfirstfound Mommythere.
Mommy always takes ginger. Daddy always takes ham and cheese. l take cake. l'm afraid l don't understand, Molly.
Oh, ifyou only knew!
- If he only knew!
- Oh, but Molly.
You're gettting too big for Heaven's Gate.
Don'tyou see?
- Butyou and Daddy didn't gettoo big.
- Oh...
Now, let Sniffout and run upstairs to bed. l'll bring him up and tuckyou in.
Oh, Daddy!
Oh, Daddy!
Yes, my baby.
Daddy...
You mustn't cy.
Now. Now, that's all over.
You tell me what it's all about. Here.
You take Daddy's handkerchief.
Tell me the whole thing.
Daddy... it's my September Saturday and we're not going...
No.
..cos l'm a big girl now.
Daddy, why do we have to go and get big? lt's not because you're so big, darling. l still thinkyou're pre_ litttle.
Butwejust can't manage Heaven's Gate any more, because... because things are all changed.
Because Mommy's going away?
Well, because ofthat and a lot ofotherthings.
We're all so sory. You and Daddy, and even your mother, l guess.
Butwe'vejust gotto think of something else to have fun with.
You know, there's gonna be a circus in town Saturday.
Gee, l'd like to see a circus. Wouldn'tyou?
Well, l'd like to see a circus if it didn't come my September Saturday. l'll be all packed and ready. l couldn't bearto come back here.
We needn't come back here.
We can drive straight into town. l'll getthe dog in and go up. l don'twant Mollyto stay awake.
Molly!
What's happened? Give herto me!
Whatwas it, Don? l don't know.
Something about missing her picnic day. l don't suppose we could go through with it?
- Could we?
- Maybe you could. l couldn't.
Besides, you can'tfool her. l'd betttertake herto the circus.
So it's gettting to Molly now.
Something's gotto be done about it. l'm leaving Saturday, Don. l won't be back.
Don, l... l wantto talkto you.
There's nothing to talk about.
Wait a minute.
The blame isn't all on one side.
Listen to some truths. l didn'ttake Elsafrom you.
You gave herto me.
What?
You were atthe office, the laboratoy morning, noon and night. l see. l'll do whatever Elsawants me to. ltwas kind ofyou to let me have the afternoon off. l've got atooth that's been bothering me.
Too bad you'll miss all the fun atthe circus.
Now, remember, Doctor.
No popcorn, lemonade, or any ofthat stuff.
Don't let her upset her stomach.
Well, goodbye.
- Goodbye, Amy. Be home early!
- Goodbye.
Have a good time atthe dentist, Amy.
Whytime'd your mother go, Molly?
Mommywentwhen Mr Brent came.
Did she have anyything to say?
Nope,justwent!
She squeezed me and said,
''Now, you be a big girl.''
What got into me the other night, cying just because today is my September Saturday?
You don't mind so much now, do you?
Why, l don't mind hardly at all.
Whee!
- The horse missed him, didn't he?
- Yeah!
- Doctor, the hospital called. It's urgent.
- Oh.
Here, take these. Staywith Molly.
See that she has a good time.
- l wantto go with you.
- You'll have to staywith Boynton.
Be a good girl.
- Bye.
-We'll stay and see the rest ofthe show.
Molly, look.
- l dropped my hat.
-Well, you'd bettter get down and get it.
Hey!
What are you doing in there?
Now, go on, get out of here!
Ha!
We're going, Sniff. You can't hardlywait till l fix the lunch, can you, Sniff?
- Elsa. Itwas a mistake to come back here.
- l had to, Rolfe.
(RoHe_ You'll only make things much more difficult ifyou say goodbye to Molly again. l know l had no logical reason for coming back. l guess it'sjustwhat Don would call a hunch.
But, darling, l thoughtwe'd agreed on eveything.
Maybe l'm foolish, but l had to be sure.
You've gotto trust myjudgment. l mean, the situation would be easy and simple if itweren'tfor Molly.
- Don't saythat.
-We have our own lives to live. lf itweren'tfor Molly, l knowwe could be happytogether.
Well, it's true, isn't it?
Rolfe, you must give me a litttle time to thinkthis over.
Sure l will. But don't make it one minute longerthan you can help.
You shouldn'tfeel bad, Sniffy. lt'sjustthat it's diff... difficult. l think itwould be easierforthem ifyou weren't here either, so you and me will run away.
Now don't make afuss, Sniffy.
You've gotto remember thatwe're growed up now.
And besides, you have me... and l have you.
You'll always have me, won'tyou, Sniffy?
We'll go to Heaven's Gate first, say goodbye to it.
Then we'll go a long ways away.
Maybe as far as... China. l won't have room foryour brush and comb,
Sniffy. l'm afraid you'll have to use mine.
This litttle piggywentto market!
Come on, Sniffy.
Well, why didn'tyou hang onto her?
Have you phoned the house?
That's right. Amy's atthe dentist.
Well, you waitthere atthe circus and l'll look around town.
Yes.
Hello there! Where are you bound for with all that baggage?
Oh,just places.
Just places? Theytell me it's pre_fine county round there.
- Yes, sir.
- Some places l know are a long way away.
Would you like to rest a minute, pass the time ofday? l can't do that. l'm too busy.
You see, l've gotto find myselfa new home. l see.
Say, does your mother know thatyou're leaving home?
No, sir. l justthoughtthat up all by myself.
Well, l'll be a grasshopper!
Say, l'm a pre_ smarrtfellow when it comes to keeping secrets.
Where are you figuring going?
Well, l did kind ofthink that l'd keep it all to myself.
There's no one else around here.
-All right, l'll tell you.
- (man chuckles)
- Hello there, Molly.
- Hello, Mr Thorpe.
Thankyou.
Doctor, she'll be found. l'm sure she'll be found.
Hello?
Yes, this is Middleton.
-What's that?
- Thorpe saw Molly.
On the road to Hammondsporrt.
Why didn't Thorpe bring her back?
Was she with anyone?
Yeah. Thorpe said she was talking to some man.
What? No, we don't knowwho he is.
Well, sure.
We're sending the boys right out.
Well, wait. l'll be right over. l guess you can see l've got all the clothes l need.
Well, l'm here to say so.
But... how about money?
- l've got lots of money.
- (co韓 rattles)
Look!
Why, l guess l must have about athousand million dollars in there.
My, my, that 韘 a lot of money! l guess with that much money l could even go all the wayto China if l wanted to. l reckon you could.
Do you think itwould be a good idea if l did go to China?
Well, now, l can't say aboutthat.
You know, l've tramped a lot in mytime, but l always seem tojust miss China.
-Are you atramp?!
- l guess you could call me that.
Oh, goody! l always wanted to be atramp.
Have you now? l always thought it'd be fun to get as di_ as l could.
That's funny. l always thought it'd be fun to get as clean as l could.
Well, l do think it'd be fun notto have to wash behind your ears.
You knowwhat l mean - get all that soap sud in your eyes.
What?!
(chuckles) Let me tell you something, young lady, l'd love to have a litttle girl like you.
- Do you really and truly mean that?
- Cross my hearrt.
All right, then, you can have me.
Huh?! l'm looking for someone who wants a litttle girl. We can be tramps together.
Not so fast, now. Not so fast.
How aboutyourfolks?
Theywon't mind. l'm gonna say goodbye to Heaven's Gate, pretend that Daddy and Mommy are there. l see. Afteryou say goodbye, don'tyou think it'd be a good ideato go home for awhile?
Oh, no. l can't go home any more at all.
Why not?
Mr Brent said, if l weren'tthere
Mommy could be happywith M'r Brent and Daddywouldn't have to be bothered taking me to circuses when he's so busy. l see.
Mr Brent said all that, did he?
(s韌hs) Yes. Mr Brent said l was in the way.
You pooryoung one.
- l heard about Molly. Is ittrue?
- Yes.
- Is eveything being done?
- They're looking for her now. l've tried to get in touch with Mrs Middleton, but l don't knowwhere she is.
- You don't knowwhere Mrs Middleton is?
- No.
- But l thought...
- So did l, but l was wrong.
She loves him and he loves her - l'm sure ofthat.
You see, we both tried to take something that didn't belong to us, and itwon'twork.
And what do you intend to do about it,
Mr Brent? l don't know. l... l wish l could do something to make things easierforyou before l leave.
You have.
- You've shown me howto be a good loser.
-Atttagirl.
Just a minute!
We wantto have atalkwith you.
- You came to give me the keys to the city(?)
- So it's thatway, is it?
Wait a minute, Jim. Let me talkto him.
Have you seen my litttle girl?
- l saw a litttle girl.
-What have you done with her?
What have l...? l haven't done anyything with her. l can't say the same aboutthe people she spoke about.
-What do you mean?
- Let us handle this.
Wait a minute.
What did Molly...
What did my litttle girl say?
Mister, do you mind stepping into my officejust a moment?
- l'd like to speakto you confidentially.
- Cerrtainly.
Mister, the other people l just spoke to you about... seem to have come pre_ close to giving that litttle girl a broken hearrt.
And on account ofwhat she told me l have afewthings to sayto you that l don'tthinkyou want other people to hear.
-Well?
- She told me that she thought that ifshe ran away, you and yourwife wouldn't have to bother about her any more.
Molly said that?
Did she saywhere she was going? l'm coming to that. l'm coming to that. l may be speaking out ofturn, but l've gotto tell you this. l had a litttle girl once, and l lost her.
And l've been awanderer ever since tying to forget.
- l think l understand.
- Mister, if l were you, l wouldn'twantthatto happen to me.
That's what l thought when she starrted for Heaven's Gate.
- Molly said she was going to Heaven's Gate?
- That's what she said, Mister.
Molly!
Molly!
- Molly!
- Daddy! Daddy!
Look, Daddy, l can swim.
Look, Daddy, l can swim.
Oh, Molly! Ofcourse you can swim. l didn't know itwas my really daddy. l thought itwasjust my pretend.
- Don'tyou like it?
- It's wonderrful. lt's much bettterthan pretending.
Nowwe only have to pretend Mommy.
Well, ifthis isn't a picnic fit to set before king, l never saw one.
You know, Mollythis is awonderrful lunch.
Uh-huh.
Only, ''Uh-huh''?
See here, young lady. We've gotto do bettter than this on our September Saturday.
This is going to be awonderrful day.
Daddy, l wasjustthinking that eveything would be so much more wonderrful ifonly Mommywas here.
-Wouldn't it, Daddy?
- Yes, Molly, itwould be.
Daddy, aren't l ever going to see Mommy again?
Why, ofcourse you are, darling.
You'll staywith her parrt ofthe time, and then you'll staywith me.
Butthat's no fun! l want us all together. Always.
Well, l... l'm afraid it's too late forthat, Molly. You see...
Daddy! It's nottoo late.
It's nottoo late!
Mommy's here!
Mommy's here! Mommy!
Oh, Molly! Oh, Molly!
Oh, Mommy, you did come!
You're really and truly here.
- Yes, darling, l'm here. Really and truly.
- Oh, goody!
Mommy's here, Daddy! Mommy's here!
Oh, Don, you had to make sure that Molly had her September Saturday, didn'tyou? l wish l could saythatwere true. l came here... l doesn't mattterwhywe came.
We're here, all of us together again. lsn'tthat all that mattters?
Do you really mean that? lt's the best! It's the best ever!
Now smile, Mommy.
You're not supposed to cy.
You supposed to smile and laugh.
That's fine. Now l can take the picture.
Now I lay me down to sleep.
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.
If I should die before I wake,
I pray the Lord my soul do take.
God bless Mrs Higgins.
God bless Mrs Denham.
And God bless the trustees, and please make us good children.
Forever and ever. Amen.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
And God bless my sister, Mary. Amen.
Please take very good care of my duck and my pony.
Please see that they don't catch pneumonia.
Spunky.
You'll get me in trouble.
What you need, Spunky, is a hot lemonade.
Will you be quiet?
Spunky, do you like the superintendent?
What? What?
Do you like Mrs Denham?
Do you like the trustees?
Do you like me, Spunky?
Spunk?
Good morning. Nothing must be allowed to go wrong today. Absolutely nothing.
I hope to please all the trustees, but I'm anxious that we make a good impression
- on Mr Morgan.
- I think I understand.
You think? Why, that isn't good enough.
Read that, Henrietta.
Read it carefully.
Mr Morgan is our richest trustee.
He's coming here today for the first time.
If he is really pleased with the orphanage,
I believe he'll double his donation to us.
- Oh, how wonderful.
- Exactly.
- Seven o'clock. Call the children.
- Very well.
Henrietta, I forgot. Mr James Wyckoff will be among the trustees who will visit.
I want you to make sure a large bottle of Mr Wyckoffs famous cough mixture is displayed in our medicine cabinet.
I'll see to it.
Elizabeth Blair, what have you got to say for yourself?
Oh, my goodness!
Elizabeth Blair, come into my office - at once.
Yes, ma'am.
This is the second time in a month you've been called to the superintendents office.
- Yes, ma'am.
- The last time you were here, your sister Mary was also brought before me.
You both admitted that you had been singing and dancing without permission.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Do you know why you are here this time?
- Yes, ma'am.
- Then tell me why.
Don't you know?
Quiet. Now, Elizabeth, tell me why you are here.
- Because I took a pony to bed with me.
- Child, you're absolutely uncontrollable.
Yes, ma'am.
I am well aware that your late father and mother were in the theatrical profession and that you came here with no sense of discipline.
I have made every allowance for you.
But when you bring animals into the dormitory, I must act.
That's what my daddy and mummy used to do.
- What?
- Act.
Don't be impudent.
Now, your pony and your duck will be sold immediately.
Please, Mrs Higgins, please.
I'll be good, but don't take Spunky away from me, and my poor little duck.
And why not?
Because my pony and my duck are notjust ordinary animals.
My daddy and my mommy teached them to do tricks on the stage.
And just what is your duck trained to do?
My duck does a wonderful trick.
My duck can lay an egg.
- And just what is so wonderful about that?
- Well, can you lay an egg?
Oh, excuse me.
Elizabeth, I have decided to get rid of your pony and your duck.
- They will be sent away this morning.
- Yes, ma'am.
No sniffling, now.
- Yes, ma'am.
- What?
No, ma'am.
There, baby, don't cry.
Mary, don't let them.
Please don't let them send Spunky and my duck away.
Oh, darling... Now, listen to me, dear.
Listen very carefully to what I'm going to tell you.
All right.
Spunky would be very unhappy if he saw you crying.
- I suppose so.
- You don't want to make him unhappy?
- Oh, no.
- All right, then.
When it's time to say goodbye to Spunky, you'll have to be just as brave as brave can be, so you can make him brave too. See?
- Spunky and I are such awfully good friends.
- I know, dear.
All right, Mary. I'll try and be brave about Spunky and my duck.
Good for you. Look, how'd you like to help me get lunch?
I'd love that. I like to make things to eat and I especially like to eat them.
Oh, my goodness!
Singing in the dining room! Is this the kind of manners you teach them?
Of course not, Mr Wyckoff. They've been told they must be quiet at mealtimes.
Oh, they've been told, have they? Well, just telling them doesn't seem to be good enough.
Perhaps a bit of real discipline wouldn't do them any harm.
- Have you been told not to sing?
- Yes, sir.
Then why do you do it?
You're a bad and wicked child.
She isn't a bad and wicked child.
She's just a baby.
She was making the children laugh.
It wasn't her fault.
I told her to sing for the children.
And who are you, young woman?
- Are you an orphan too?
- Yes, sir.
Then what right have you to be here, living on charity at your age?
I'll tell you what I'm doing here.
I scrub the floors, make the beds, wash, iron and cook from morning until night.
- Quiet!
- I won't be quiet.
- You're mean and hateful to frighten children.
- Report to me after the meeting.
Yes, ma'am.
The rest of you, go to the yard and wait there till it's time for inspection by our trustees.
Yes, Mrs Higgins.
- Aren't you going to join us, Mr Morgan?
- What?
- Yes, of course, the meeting of the trustees.
- Of course.
Would you mind beginning without me?
I'd like to look about the place.
- But we have important matters...
- I'll join you in a few minutes.
- Well, of course...
- Thank you.
She isn't wicked...
- Oh... I'm sorry.
- Please don't get up.
I just wanted to tell you how much I admired your spunk in standing up for that youngster.
- She didn't mean any harm.
- Of course she didn't.
I don't think singing that song was such a terrible crime.
I enjoyed it.
I enjoyed your playing, too.
Thank you very much.
Tell me, where in the world did that youngster pick up such a charming song?
- Well, I write them and...
- You write music?
- If you can call it music.
- I call it delightful music.
Look here, would you promise not to give me away if I made a terrible confession?
Of course.
The deep, dark secret in my life is that now and then I compose a bit of music myself.
But isn't it fun, getting a melody and then finding just the right words for it?
Great. You know, the happiest days of my life were those I spent studying music under Professor Auspitzer, in Br黱n.
Those must have been happy days.
But that isn't all of it.
I love the people in the little Austrian towns.
They're so proud because their music is the music of the world.
It seems that most everyone in those quaint little villages has a "Hello, neighbour" smile.
They love the simple things in life.
The simple things in life.
That almost sounds like the words of a song.
I'll remember the suggestion.
Perhaps someday they might make a song.
- Will you do me a great favour?
- Certainly.
I have to run along to the meeting, but I'll be back. Will you play me some more music?
- If you'd like to hear it and Mrs Higgins...
- I asked to.
- All right.
- Until later, then?
And what's this item?
"Sandboxes and swings"?
It's a problem to keep them occupied.
When I was young, we didn't have a play problem, because we didn't have time to play. No.
"Floor runner for the dormitory. "
- What's the matter with the linoleum?
- It's been so cold this winter.
The children have coughed so badly that I've been worried.
No need for that.
Madam, you have no doubt heard of the famous Wyckoffs cough mixture.
Of course.
I have manufactured and sold that cough mixture for many years.
Anyone taking it regularly will never cough.
I would suggest that you lay in a fresh supply.
- Very well.
- When I was young, I lived in Maine, where the weather was 20 below zero.
In those days, we didn't even have linoleum.
And look at me now.
When I was young, I lived in Maine, where the weather was about a thousand below zero.
No, no, Mrs Denham.
No carpets, no linoleum, no nothin'.
And look at me now.
Madam, is this the kind of respect you teach them?!
Oh, my goodness!
- How dare you take my hat and coat!
- I beg your pardon, but those are mine.
- Yours?
- Yes.
Oh, yes. I see.
- This eyesight of mine is bad, you know.
- I was only playing.
There, Mrs Higgins.
That's what comes of letting them play.
- Ridiculing their benefactors.
- I'm sorry.
It seems to me that this child is absolutely incorrigible.
Every time I see her, she's making a disturbance.
- She is rather a problem.
- Problem?
She's the sort of problem that might be better solved at a public institution.
- We couldn't send her away.
- I say you shall send her away!
I say she'll have to go to a public institution.
She'll have to do nothing of the kind.
If she's sent away,
I shan't contribute another cent.
- Now, Mr Morgan, you can't...
- Oh, yes, I can.
Mrs Higgins, I'd like to talk to you and to this little girl privately.
- Your office would be the best place.
- Why, of course, Mr Morgan.
Young lady, I've got a great idea.
Would you like me to tell it to you?
- Yes.
- Elizabeth.
Excuse me. Yes, sir.
That's better.
Now look here. Here's the secret.
How would you like it if you and I got to be very, very good friends?
- I don't think I would like it, sir.
- Why, Elizabeth!
I would like to talk to Elizabeth alone.
Do you mind?
- Of course not.
- Thank you.
Tell me. Why wouldn't you like to be friends with me?
- Oh, just because.
- Just because?
You've got to give me a much better reason than that.
Well, it's just because when grown-ups come to visit us we have to say "Yes, ma'am" and "No, sir" and smile all the time.
- Can you keep a secret?
- A secret?
Mm-hm.
- I won't tell anybody.
- Shake.
Now, here's the secret:
You don't have to say any of those things to me.
You see, all this business out here is new to me.
- My regular business is being a lawyer.
- What's a lawyer?
If you ever get into trouble, a lawyer is a person who gets you out of trouble.
Oh, my, I could use one almost every day.
- Tell me, what's your name, sweet?
- Elizabeth Blair.
Elizabeth Blair. I've got a much better name for you than that.
If I had my way, I'd call you Curly Top.
That's what my daddy used to call me, and my mommy too.
They did? I'll bet you're just as wise as wise can be.
- Well, I can recite.
- Recite? Recite what?
- Oh, poems.
- What kind of poems?
"Before I was a little girl,
I was a little bird.
"I could not laugh, I could not dance,
I could not speak a word.
"But all about the woods I went and up into the sky.
"And isn't it a pity I've forgotten how to fly?"
I think that's the loveliest poem I ever heard.
- I know more.
- Go right ahead.
"I wake in the morning early, and always the very first thing,
"I poke out my head, and I sit up in bed, and I sing and I sing and I sing. "
- I know more.
- I'll bet you do.
But listen, I've got a friend that...
- Oh, I bet that isn't true.
- What?
You said you had a friend.
I bet you have lots of friends.
Curly, you are an old flatterer.
- Is that something bad?
- Of course not, darling. Now, look here.
I'm pretty sure this friend of mine would like you.
I think he'd like to give you a beautiful home, lovely dresses to wear, dozens of dolls, and send you to the grandest kind of school and all sorts of nice things like that.
How could your friend do all that? I thought only daddies could do such nice things.
Well, being a lawyer, that's where that comes in.
You are too young to understand, but I could arrange with my friend to legally adopt you.
All I want you to tell me is how you'd like it if my friend could do those nice things for you.
- Would you want him to?
- I don't think I could do it.
You couldn't? Why not?
Do I have to say right off?
You mean you want time to think it over?
- Could I come back and tell you in a while?
- Why, of course. I'll wait for you right here.
- Promise?
- Promise.
Cross your heart?
Mary!
Mary! Oh, Mary!
Mary! Mary!
Mary!
Mrs Denham, suppose that youngster had a real chance in life.
Suppose someone gave her everything money can buy.
Of course, we always hope our children may be adopted.
But Elizabeth's case presents a special problem. You see...
There's no human problem that can't be solved by kindness.
- By Jove, Mrs Denham, I'll do it.
- You mean that you'll adopt Elizabeth?
On one condition. She must never know that I'm her guardian.
Why not?
Because she's always had to give thanks for every mouthful.
She's never gonna have to be grateful to me.
From now on, she's going to have all the lovely things in life, just because she has a right to them.
- But the child will have to be told something.
- That's right. Let's see.
I've got it. Tell her that I'm acting for a client.
We'll say that she's being adopted by a man by the name of...
- Let's call him Hiram Jones.
- Oh, Mr Morgan...
Before you go on, there's something about Elizabeth that you must know.
Come in.
Well, have you made up your mind?
- You haven't? Why not?
- Could I tell your friend?
My friend?
Oh!
You mean Mr Jones. Hiram Jones, hm?
What is it you want to tell him?
I would like to tell him that I'd love to go and live in his house if my sister could come too.
- Your sister?
- Yes, my sister, Mary.
- She works in the kitchen. There she is.
- This is Mary Blair, Mr Morgan.
We've met.
Isn't my sister pretty?
And she's awfully nice, too.
Mr Morgan, I'm very grateful to you -
I mean, to your friend - for wanting to adopt Curly.
But you see, when my father and mother...
- Darling, could you run outside?
- Must I?
- I think you'd better.
- All right.
You see, Mr Morgan, at the time my father and mother were killed...
- Killed?
- Yes, in an automobile accident.
- I'm so sorry.
- At the hospital, just before they... just before they died,
I promised them Curly and I would never be separated.
I couldn't break that promise, Mr Morgan.
She needs me. And I need her.
I understand.
I hope you'll thank your friend for us.
Please tell him how grateful we are, but...
Goodbye, Mr Morgan.
- I like that.
- Thank you, Aunt Genevieve.
- One of your own compositions?
- The melody came to me only this evening.
Quite the nicest thing you've ever done,
Edward. It has real feeling.
Your little nephew has real feeling, my darling, just like anyone else.
I'm going upstairs to write some letters.
I'll come down and kiss you good night before I go to bed.
- Promise?
- I do.
All right, it's a bargain.
In the meantime I shall be thinking up at least six new compliments for you.
Edward?
Edward.
- Aunt Genevieve.
- Well, I'm waiting.
- For what?
- For my compliments, of course.
- You promised me an even half-dozen.
- So I did.
I shan't be able to keep my promise.
I've been very busy.
- Busy.
- Word of honour.
I've been playing an old and charming game.
I've been daydreaming.
Just suppose, for example...
See that painting there?
But of course I do. I'll have you know my eyesight's every bit as good as it ever was.
Suppose the figure of that lovely child should suddenly come to life.
Suppose it smiled at you and waved its hand.
- What would you do?
- I'd call a doctor.
Now, Edward, now, now, take it easy.
Well, the truth of the matter is,
I just love your game.
I'd adore it if the child in that picture could come into this home and actually live with us.
Do you really mean that, Aunt Genevieve?
There's nothing that makes a home so happy as the sound of a chil飐 laughter.
- By Jove, I'll do it.
- Do what?
We'll open our place at Southampton. I can arrange for all the necessary legal details.
You can do all the shopping required:
Dresses and all the gadgets that go with them.
We'll have a glorious summer.
I'll send the limousine out next week...
- For what?
- For that lovely child in the painting.
Now, Edward, game or no game, you sound to me a little tetched in the head.
I've gone mad, Aunt Genevieve.
Delightfully mad.
- I think I will send for that doctor.
- I should if I were you.
And before the doctor arrives, let me be the first to congratulate you.
- Congratulate me? For what?
- My dear, you're about to become a mother.
- Bye, Mrs Denham.
- Bye.
- Goodbye.
- Bye, Mrs Higgins.
Goodbye.
Goodbye, Mrs Higgins.
- All right, Mister.
- Very good, Miss.
Goodbye, Jeanie. Goodbye, Betsy.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Henrietta, what are you blubbering about?
I can't help it. I'm so happy.
There's no need to be sentimental.
What are you crying for?
Why shouldn't I? Why can't I be happy too?
Mrs Higgins said that now we're going to live in high society we must always remember to be grand ladies.
Oh, I won't forget.
My word!
Will you tell Mr Morgan that Miss Blair and her sister are here?
Hello, Mister.
Elizabeth.
Am I to understand that the livestock are also calling on Mr Morgan?
- They are.
- My word!
- A Miss Blair and her sister to see you, sir.
- Aunt Genevieve, they're here.
Hello.
Curly!
Well, where in the world did the menagerie come from?
- They were right behind us all the time.
- Right behind you?
Yes, sir, in the back seat.
Aunt Genevieve, meet our new family.
- Mary, Elizabeth, this is Aunt Genevieve.
- My dears, I'm very glad to see you both.
- Won't you come in?
- Hello.
Hello!
Oh, Reynolds, will you see to it that our other guests are comfortably taken care of?
You mean the, uh... livestock, sir?
Right.
Butling to a pony and a duck!
Now, no nonsense now.
I say, do you understand what I'm saying to you?
My word!
- How do you like your new home?
- It's wonderful.
- Would you like to look round?
- Mm-hm.
But first I would like to see where
Spunky and Betsy are going to sleep.
Oh, no, Edward.
Elizabeth must rest before dinner.
- Come now, Aunt...
- Mr Jones has given strict orders.
Mr Jones insists that Elizabeth and Mary have only the best of care.
- I see. Well, we can't argue with Mr Jones.
- That's what I thought.
All right, then, Mr Jones wins.
But I'll see you all at dinner, hm?
Come, dear.
Breakfast at eight. Luncheon at one.
Dinner at seven.
My word!
I think this will help you, Miss.
Allow me.
Now I'm just like a grown-up.
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, Miss.
Why, I didn't do anything.
- Yes, Miss?
- Wouldn't you like to sit down too?
Well...
- Coffee on the terrace, Reynolds.
- Very good, sir.
Could I say something to Mr Reynolds, privately?
I think it could be arranged.
But don't stay too long.
I won't.
I want to thank you for a very nice dinner, sir.
Thank you, Miss.
You wish for something else, Miss?
What is it, Miss?
Couldn't you come down here so I could talk to you?
Oh, my word, you are a package!
Will you be my friend?
Whenever I do anything wrong at the table, will you always stop me?
I will indeed, Miss.
- Promise?
- I do, Miss.
I'll always attempt to serve you as if... as if you were a princess.
A princess? My, you are nice.
- Happy?
- I didn't know such happiness existed.
Promise to let me know if Mr Jones can do more for you?
He couldn't do anything more.
- But you could do me a great favour.
- Done. What?
Tell me all about Mr Jones.
Not knowing him or even what he looks like makes him seem such a strange person.
He is a strange sort of person, Mary.
Very strange.
Perhaps I can best explain him to you if I tell you what he said just before you came here.
Do tell me.
He told me that all of his life he's had a hunger in his heart.
A hunger to love and be loved just for himself.
Said he'd travelled all over the world
- Europe, Egypt, the Orient - he'd searched everywhere for a simple sort of happiness and companionship.
- He never found it?
- Not real happiness.
He will find it someday. He must.
Maybe you're right, Mary.
Happiness may come to Jones, and soon.
Just before he sailed for Europe, he said that, at last, there was... hope in his heart.
I wish I could thank him for all he's done.
Tell him how grateful I am for all the happiness he's brought to Curly and me.
Just knowing that you and Curly have found happiness here, that'll make him happy.
I can promise you that.
This is not a dream, is it?
No, darling. Come to bed now.
- Good night. Did you say your prayers?
- Mm-hm.
- Mary?
- Yes, dear?
My pyjamas feel awfully nice.
What are they made of, Mary?
- Silk.
- Silk?
Oh, my goodness!
Good night, dear.
Good night.
Mary.
Uncle Edward said that Mr Jones was going to send you to a music school.
Uh-huh.
And he said that he was going to give me a pony cart and lots of pretty dresses.
I know, dear. It's all so wonderful,
I can hardly believe it.
But we mustn't talk about it any more tonight.
It's time to go to sleep. Good night.
Good night.
Mary... is Mr Hiram Jones a very rich man?
He must be, darling.
Do you think maybe he could be the richest man in the world?
Mm, he might be.
The richest man in all the world?
Oh, my goodness!
- Your Southampton bills, sir.
- Thank you.
Two aquaplane boards. Don't you think it's dangerous for that youngster to...?
Dangerous? That child swims like a fish.
I really believe she's Neptune's daughter in disguise.
I hope you enjoyed your lunch,
Miss Elizabeth.
- I always like to eat.
- A splendid habit, Miss, if I may say so.
- Did my pony and duck have a nice lunch?
- Oh, quite, Miss.
- Are you going to give me a nice dinner?
- Without fail, Miss.
- I wish you wouldn't bow so much.
- I'm sorry, Miss.
There you go again.
You'll make my back ache.
My word!
- Isn't that the funniest picture ever?
- Mm-hm.
Curly, careful of your eyes in this sunlight.
Oh, this won't hurt my eyes.
This is just the funny papers.
Isn't that the one I've read you at least a dozen times since Sunday?
Mm-hm.
- Will you read it to me again?
- Yes, if you like.
But suppose we wait until later in the afternoon, after you've had your nap?
All right. I won't forget.
Jimmie, the Atlantic Ocean seems rather quiet without you splashing about.
- Why aren't you swimming today?
- I couldn't make it today. I had to work.
Work? I hope you don't call flying that airplane of yours work.
Mary loves to fly.
She's been up lots of times with me.
Yes, she's told me all about it.
You've been very nice to Mary this summer.
- That isn't hard to do.
- No, I gathered you didn't find that hard work.
Mrs Graham, I'd like to talk to you about Mary.
- Well, there's no law against it.
- Mary is a wonderful girl, Mrs Graham.
We've had grand times together this summer.
Seems that, no matter what, we always like the same things.
She likes to fly with me, she's a beautiful dancer, and we're both crazy about all kinds of outdoor sport.
I'd like to talk about Mary to her guardian, Mr Jones.
- But the catch is that he's in Europe now.
- What would you like to say to Mr Jones?
Well, you see, Mary doesn't want to make up her mind about anything -
I mean, anything important - without Mr Jones' permission.
- I thought maybe I could write him a letter.
- What about?
Well, I... I really can't tell you that,
Mrs Graham.
- I haven't even told Mary about that.
- Oh, I see.
- Do you think I ought to write to Mr Jones...
- Jimmie.
- Hello, Mary.
- Hello, Jimmie.
The water was wonderful.
Aunt Genevieve, did you sell him a ticket?
- Mary, I forgot.
- A ticket? For what?
Don't tell me you don't know about it.
We're giving a show.
- Who is? What's this all about?
- It's Curly's show, really.
I'm just going to help out.
It's a benefit performance.
- A benefit? For whom?
- Curly had the most charming idea, Jimmie.
She couldn't forget her friends in the orphanage.
She wanted to raise some money to buy playthings for them.
- It was so nice of you to come, Mrs Denham.
- Wild horses couldn't have kept me away.
Do you know, this is the biggest thrill of my life.
- I'd try awfully hard to make you happy.
- Jimmie, you're pretty swell, but I... I just couldn't marry you.
Is there someone else?
- I can't tell you that.
- Well, I know there is, all right.
I watched you at dinner tonight and I watched you...
Well, you're always looking at Mr Morgan.
- Why shouldn't I?
- Because I don't like him.
He's got a swelled head, and just because he's got all the money in the world, he...
Jimmie... I won't let you talk about him that way.
I'm sorry.
- It's all right.
- I'll always love you, Mary.
Even... even if you say you can't really care for me.
Oh, Jimmie...
Do stop that ridiculous prowling about.
You act as if you had the heebie-jeebies.
- I'm just restless.
- You've been restless for the last three days.
Ever since you arrived to see Curly's show.
Can't you think of something more interesting to talk about? I'm just nervous.
I might be able to change the subject if I really put my mind to it.
- It'd make a hit with me if you will.
- Very well.
Let me see, what shall we talk about?
- Have you seen Mary since dinner?
- Nope, I haven't.
She, uh... she went out somewhere with Jimmie, didn't she?
- How should I know?
- Don't they make an adorable couple?
- Do they?
- He's very much in love with her.
He's a wonderful catch. He comes into money on both sides of his family.
He does, does he? Maybe that's the reason he's got a swelled head.
That, and the brass buttons on his trick uniform.
Why, Edward, I didn't know you'd ever noticed Jimmie.
I am surprised to learn that you've even observed the kind of clothes he wears.
Conceited young idler.
- Will you stop laughing?
- I will not.
Edward Morgan, insanely jealous, and acting like a sixteen-year-old Romeo.
Oh, dear, this is the happiest moment of my life.
I'm not at all jealous. Do you think
I care anything about Mary Blair?
The only reason she's here is because it was impossible to take Elizabeth without her.
- I'm not in the least interested in Mary.
- I'm so relieved to hear you say that.
- Relieved? Why?
- Edward, I've been noticing things.
And I had convinced myself that you'd grown very fond of Mary.
- In which case, there might be complications.
- Complications?
I'll try to make myself clear.
I believe that Jimmie Rogers means to propose to Mary before the summer is over.
- How do you know that?
- I looked at him.
You think you can tell a thing like that by just looking at a man?
Any woman of my age and experience who can't tell just by looking at a man...
Oh, nonsense!
What are you thinking about?
- I'm not thinking. I've decided.
- Decided what?
- I'll get the fastest plane in the country.
- You aren't going to fly it yourself?
Certainly. Why not?
And that isn't all. I'm going to start learning some of those trick dances, too.
- I'll make you happy, Mary. I know I will.
- I believe you, Jimmie.
- Oh, hello, Mr Morgan.
- Jimmie, will you pardon me?
- Mary, I want to talk to you alone.
- You'll have to ask me about that, sir.
- What?
- Jimmie.
I want to tell him. I'm the luckiest man in the world, Mr Morgan.
Lucky? What do you mean?
- Mary and I have just become engaged, sir.
- Engaged?
That's right, sir. The way I feel about it, well,
I just want to go out and tell the whole world.
I understand, Jimmie.
You should be very proud.
Mary's a fine girl.
- I want to be the first to congratulate you.
- Thank you, sir.
Mary, my congratulations to you.
I'm sure that you and Jimmie will find real happiness.
- I'll do everything to make that come true.
- I'm sure.
And if there's ever anything I can do to add to your happiness - anything, understand? -
- I want you to promise to let me know.
- Say, Mr Morgan, you're pretty swell.
- I mean it, Jimmie, every word of it.
- Thank you, sir.
Well, good night. Good night and my best to both of you, always.
Uncle Edward! Uncle Edward!
Time to get up.
Uncle Edward.
Oh, my goodness!
Sleepy head! If you aren't really awake,
I can jump on your stomach again.
Never mind!
- You can't go back to sleep again.
- This is Sunday morning...
Oh, no, Uncle Edward. No, sir!
All right, you win.
- Read me the funny papers?
- Wait a minute.
How about breakfast and Sunday school?
I like Sunday school. Will you take me?
- Yes, siree.
- Give me a ride?
- I'll get your bathrobe and slippers.
- All right.
Yippee!
All right, that's enough of that.
Now, I want you to tell me everything you've been doing while I've been away.
I've been in the city for a whole week.
What have you been up to?
- Every day I was wishing that you were here.
- Curly, you flatterer.
- Any special reason you wanted to see me?
- Very special.
- I wanted to talk to you about something.
- All right, here I am. What is it?
Well, I wanted to talk to you about getting married.
What?!
Curly, whatever put that notion into your funny little head?
- Please don't laugh, Uncle Edward.
- I'm sorry. I forgot that this was very special.
Now, just what is it you want to know about getting married?
- Well... what does getting married mean?
- You mean like Jimmie and Mary?
That means they'll have their own home and always live together.
Mary said that I was going to live in Jimmie's house.
Does that mean Jimmie's getting married to me too?
- I'll tell you all about that some other time.
- I don't want to get married to Jimmie.
- Why not?
- I want Mary and me to get married to you.
Curly, you're a designing woman.
Now get up and get out of here.
I've got to get dressed. Do you hear me?
Come on.
Now, breakfast, funnies,
Sunday school and lunch.
- Then I've got a real surprise for you.
- Is it a present?
It wouldn't be a surprise any more if I told you.
Mary! Mary!
My word!
- Look at Aunt Genevieve.
- Edward, how dare you spy on me!
- What's the matter, growing pains?
- Why shouldn't I grow up?
- Please, Uncle Edward, what's my surprise?
- I have two surprises for you, young lady.
- Two?!
- Mm-hm.
Come on, darling.
- Ready for the first one?
- I can hardly wait.
You won't have to wait - not another minute.
You sit right here and listen very, very carefully.
All right.
Whoopee!
- Oh, but you are a bundle ofjoy.
- That was beautiful, dear.
Thank you.
Have you got a present for me too?
Yes, one for you and one for Mary.
- Will you run and tell Mary to come in?
- Mm-hm.
Mary! Mary!
Uncle Edward has a surprise for us.
You might as well admit that you're in love with Mary.
- Why don't you tell her so?
- Haven't you heard the news?
It so happens that
Mary's engaged to Jimmie.
Have you ever told her that you love her?
Here she is, Uncle Edward.
- Can I have my surprise first?
- Yes, indeed you may.
- Oh, goodie.
- Here you are, young lady.
A string of pearls.
Pearls?
They lookjust like those little stones on the beach.
- Oh, Elizabeth!
- Do you like them?
I would really rather have a pair of roller skates.
Well, we'll throw them in for good measure.
I'm sailing for Europe next week.
Before I go, I want to give you an engagement present and wish you every happiness.
I can't take it.
Why not?
I wasn't really in love with Jimmie.
We're not engaged any more.
I told him last night.
- You aren't going to marry him?
- No.
- Mary, you'd better watch out.
- Watch out?
You might not get married at all.
I asked Uncle Edward to marry us this morning and he said he wouldn't.
- Oh, Elizabeth, you didn't?
- Oh, yes, I did.
Didn't I ask you to marry us, Uncle Edward?
Oh, Elizabeth!
Mary, wait. I... I want to talk with you.
What's the matter?
They seem kind of excited.
- We'll go abroad and stay a whole year.
- It sounds like heaven.
- We'll make it heaven, darling.
- Look, can't we share our happiness?
- What do you mean?
- With the person who made it possible.
- You mean Mr Jones?
- Yes.
Oh, Mary, you blind little sweetheart.
There never was any Mr Jones.
- You mean that... you're Mr...?
- Mm-hm.
Oh!
Mary, do you mind if Uncle Edward could come now and read me the funnies?
Oh, my word!
Tom!
Oh, Tom!
Hey, Jim!
Whee!
Drat that boy.
He's always late.
I declare, you'd never know that Tom and Sid was even half-brothers, would you?
If he'd learned his Bible verses for Sunday school, he might be a better boy.
We won't wait for him.
Sit down and eat.
Fetch the cake.
Let me help you with it, cousin Mary.
Miss Polly!
Oh, Miss Polly!
Well, what is it, Jim?
Does you want this wood or this wood?
Oh, any wood, Jim.
Maybe this wood is better than this wood!
Oh, all right.
Heh!
Land of goshen, your hair looks like a hoorah's nest.
Did you wash your hands good?
Mmm. Gave yourself a lick and a promise,
I'll be bound worthy.
Eat your supper before it gets cold.
Lord, we thank thee for our daily bread. Amen.
Bread, cousin Mary, please.
Tom, it was powerful warm in school today, wasn't it?
Yessum.
Hmm.
Didn't you want to go swimming, Tom?
No. Well, not very much.
But you're not too warm now, though, are you?
Some of us stuck our heads under the pump.
Mine's damp yet, see?
Yes.
If you only pumped water on your head, you didn't have to undo your shirt collar where I sewed it, did you?
Hmm. Well, I was sure you'd played hooky from school and gone swimming.
Didn't you sew his collar with white thread, aunt Polly?
Yes, I did.
That thread's black.
Tom!
Huh!
Ouch! It could turn black, couldn't it?
In the sun?
Well, you're enough to give a saint the conniptions.
Yessum.
Now, you march straight up to bed and right now.
Ow!
Play hooky on Friday, whitewash on Saturday!
I would, aunt Polly, but there ain't any whitewash.
Oh, yes, there is.
I mixed 3 whole bucketfuls myself.
That whole great big fence?
Every inch of it.
And you don't want any streaks in it, do you, aunt Polly?
Nary a one.
I'll tell the boys you can't go swimming
'cause you gotta whitewash the old fence.
Bye, Tom.
Aunt Polly!
Say, Jim...
I'll fetch the water if you'll whitewash.
I can't, master Tom!
Miss Polly told me to go along and tend to my own business.
And if I don't, she'd snatch the head off of me.
She? Huh!
She never licks anybody.
Only whacks them over the head with a thimble.
Like this.
Ouch!
Excuse me, master Tom.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
Jim, I'll tell you what I'll do.
If you'll whitewash some,
I'll show you my short toe.
Let me see.
Ow!
Clear the river!
I'm the steamboat Big Missouri.
Bound for St. Louis from New Orleans.
Let her go!
Full steam ahead!
Stop her!
I'm going a-swimming, I am.
But of course, you'd rather work.
What do you call work?
Why, ain't that work?
Well, all I know is it suits Tom Sawyer.
Say, let me whitewash a little.
Think I'd let a dude whitewash?
Oh, come on now.
I'd let you if you was me.
No. If it were the inside,
I wouldn't mind.
And aunt Polly wouldn't.
But she's awful particular about the outside.
Aw, shucks.
I'd be careful.
I'll give you the rest of my apple.
Well, here...
No. I'm a-feared.
And I'll give you this, too.
Ain't that a humdinger.
What is it?
It's a knob off a brass doorknocker.
All my life I wanted a knob off a brass doorknocker.
Well...
Here.
Quick, before I change my mind.
Don't tell aunt Polly.
I ain't seen a thing, master Tom.
Hey, aunt Polly!
Aunt Polly!
This aunt Polly that.
Aunt Polly here, aunt Polly there.
Well, what's the matter now?
Can't you tend to work and leave a body in peace?
May I go now, aunt Polly?
How much have you done?
It's all done. 3 coats, too.
Now, see here, Tom,
Don't you lie to me.
I can't bear it.
Well, look.
Huh.
Well, I never!
There's no getting 'round it.
You can work when you have a mind to.
Well, run along and play.
Virtue is its own reward as the good book says.
Aunt Polly!
Ohh!
Aunt Polly!
Oh, my sakes alive!
Ohh! Ohh!
There, don't you worry,
Sidney, dear.
You can put on your Sunday suit.
Wait till I get my hands on that blabberskite when he comes home.
Go on. Oh, dear.
Yoo-hoo!
Hello, Amy.
Hello, Tom...
Dear, I got something for you.
Where have you been such a long time?
I haven't seen you since we got engaged.
I had the chicken pox.
You haven't got it now, have you?
No, silly.
Think ma-ma would let me out if I wasn't all cured?
Who's moving in across the way?
I heard ma-ma say it was the new judge.
Oh, that's their silly little girl.
She's awful!
Ma sent me over to play with her, but I wouldn't.
She's too ugly.
Nobody round here's going to like her.
Mmm. Say, Amy?
Are you sure you got over the chicken pox?
Yes.
Certain sure?
Why, yes. What's the matter?
You look awful peaked.
I do?
What are those 2 pink spots on your cheek?
Pink spots? Where?
Of course, maybe it's only poison ivy.
Yes. Maybe it is.
But I ain't been out of the house.
Oh!
Ma! Ma!
Uhh!
Becky! Becky!
Yes, mama?
Uhh!
Tom's got a girl,
Tom's got a girl.
Aunt Polly!
Hey, Ben!
Wanna buy your frog back?
Whatcha want for her?
Bible tickets.
6 blues and 6 yellers.
You're crazy.
Give you 4 blues and 5 yellers.
Hand them over.
Ohh.
And you see, judge, whenever one of our pupils learns
2 verses of scripture, he or she receives a blue ticket.
Now, 100 blue tickets entitle him or her to one yellow ticket.
And 10 yellow tickets bring the reward of a beautiful Bible.
Attention! Attention!
Ahem. Attention.
Today we have the rare privilege of distinguished visitors.
Judge Thatcher, the newly elected magistrate of our county has consented to make the presentation of the Bible prize to Sidney Sawyer.
Come up, Sidney.
Ahem.
I'm sorry, Sidney, but I'm afraid you'll have to wait another week.
You are 2 tickets short.
I wasn't short when
I came in here.
Come on.
I don't suppose there is anyone else who has learned the necessary 2,000 verses?
Oh, I thought not.
Mr. Walters!
I'm ready for a bible.
I've got enough tickets.
Well!
Very well.
Take a seat on the platform while I count them.
Ahem.
Yes, it's quite true.
Here is the requisite number of tickets.
Then the young man is certainly entitled to his reward.
Yes.
Then if you will be so kind, judge.
Well, my fine little man, what is your name?
Tom.
Oh, no.
It is, uh...
Thomas?
But you have another one,
I dare say.
Tell the gentleman your other name, Thomas, and say, sir.
Sir Thomas Sawyer.
2,000 verses are a great many.
And you can never be sorry for the trouble you took to learn them.
No doubt you know all the names of the 12 disciples?
Who were the first 2?
Answer the judge, Thomas.
Don't be afraid.
He's frightened, poor boy.
But I know he'll tell me.
Now, the names of the first
2 disciples were?
Were?
Adam and Eve!
Thy banners make tyranny tremble when borne by the red, white, and blue.
Be seated.
Thomas Sawyer!
Yes, Mr. Dobbins?
Come up here.
Now, sir...
Why are you late this time?
Perhaps you'd like to sit with the girls again?
Oh, no, Mr. Dobbins.
Then I trust you have an excellent excuse?
I stopped to talk to Huck Finn.
Huckleberry Finn!
Does your aunt allow you to associate with such riff-raff?
Well, I...
Of course not.
Go sit with the girls, you-you...
We will start with drill in multiplication.
You will have precisely 2 minutes
To write the answers on your slates.
Hmm.
Come, come.
Time is fleet.
You'll tell.
It's wonderful.
Why you bad thing!
Who drew this?!
Whose slate is this?!
Jonah Pauper, did you draw this?
No, sir.
Willie Fisher, did you?
No, sir!
Benjamin Rogers!
Rebecca Thatcher?!
Did you?
No? Look me in the eye!
Did you draw this?!
Speak up!
No?
We'll see.
Come up here,
Rebecca Thatcher.
I done it!
What?!
I did it, sir.
Come up here, Thomas Sawyer.
Hmmph!
Ooh!
Attention!
We will continue from where we were interrupted.
You have precisely...
32 seconds to complete the drill.
"How could you be so noble?"
"How could you be so noble?"
"How could you be so noble?"
Hello, Tom.
Hello, Becky.
Do you love rats?
No, I hate them.
Well, I do, too, live ones.
But I mean dead ones.
To swing around your head on a string.
No, I don't care for rats much anyway.
What I like is chewing gum.
So do I.
I wish I had some now.
I've got some at home.
I'll let you chew it a while tomorrow.
But you must give it back to me.
Say, Becky, was you ever engaged?
What's that?
Why, engaged to be married.
No.
Would you like to?
I reckon so. I don't know.
What's it like?
Like? Why, it ain't like anything.
It's...
Remember what I wrote on your slate?
Yes.
Well, just say that to each other, and you're engaged.
Anybody can do it.
Well, not now.
Some other time.
Tomorrow.
Please, Becky, I'll whisper.
I'll whisper it ever so easy.
I love you.
Now you whisper it to me.
Turn your face so as you can't see and then I will.
Turn your face away.
Now it's all over but the kiss.
Kiss?
What do you kiss for?
Why, that, well...
They always do that.
Please, Becky.
Don't be a-feared.
It ain't anything at all.
Please, Becky.
Please.
Now it's all done.
After this, you ain't never gonna marry anybody but me.
Never. Will you?
No, Tom, and you ain't ever to marry anybody but me either.
Of course.
That's part of it.
So nice. I never heard of it before.
Why, it's ever so gay.
For me and Amy Lawrence, when we was...
Amy Lawrence?!
You and Amy Lawrence?!
Oh, Tom!
Then I ain't the first you've ever been engaged to.
Don't cry, Becky.
That was a month ago.
Go away.
Look, here's something
I wanna give you.
I don't want it.
It's a knob off a brass doorknocker.
Please, Becky, won't you take it?
Well, here's the best treasure I got.
Take it.
Aah!
Meow!
Hello, Huck.
Whatcha got?
A dead cat.
Say, Huck, what's dead cats good for?
Good for?
To cure warts with.
Cure warts with?
How do you do that?
Why, you take your cat and along about midnight you go get in the graveyard where somebody wicked's been buried.
Then when the devil comes to take that fella away, why, you heave your cat at him and say, "devil, follow corpse.
"cat, follow devil, warts, follow cat.
I'm done with you."
That'll cure any wart.
When are you going to try the cat?
Well, they're burying
Old Horse Williams today.
I reckon the devil will come after him tonight.
Horse Williams, suppose he's wicked enough?
Oh, yes.
He's the wickedest man in these parts... since my pa got run out of town.
Would you let me go with you?
If you ain't a-feared.
Who's a-feared?
Well, I'm going fishing.
I guess you better be getting to school.
I'll be waiting for you at midnight.
Will you meow?
I'll meow and you meow back.
The last time 8 cats came out before you did.
Meow.
Meow.
Meow!
Oh, meow!
Meow!
Meow.
Meow!
Hey!
Hucky, do you believe that the dead people like it for us to be here?
It's all right, if you don't step on 'em.
Say, Hucky?
Do you reckon Hoss Williams hears us talkin'?
Of course, he does.
You can't be too particular how you talk.
I wished I'd said "Mr. Williams."
Shh.
The devil's comin'.
We're goners.
Can you pray?
I'll try.
Now I lay me down to sleep, I...
Look.
Why, they ain't devils.
That's Muff Potter.
Yes, and he's drunk again.
That's Dr. Robinson.
They're body-snatching.
And Injun Joe.
I'd rather they was devils than him.
Now put it in the wheelbarrow and get started.
Well?
I want my money.
You'll get your money when your job's finished,
Not until then.
Kind of high and mighty, ain't ya, for a grave robber?
I want my money now, and some more next week, and some more after that!
Why you blackmailing half-breed, I'll...
My god, don't do that! Uh!
Aah!
Muff? Huh?
Come on, Muff.
You got to get out of here.
What's the matter?
Joe... Joe...
I never meant to do it.
Of course, you didn't, Muff.
Of course, you didn't.
Huck, do you suppose we ought to tell anybody?
Do you want to get us killed?
Why, that devil Injun Joe wouldn't think any more of drownin' us than a couple of cats if we was to tell on him.
Looky here,
Let's take and swear to one another to keep mum.
Give me your hand.
No, that's good enough for little, rubbishy things.
Ought to be writin' abing like this, and signed in blood.
Yeah, and lots of swearing.
"Huck... Finn...
"and Tom Sawyer...
"swear they will keep mum,
"and may they drop down dead in their tracks if they ever tell and rot."
No use to keep bangin' on that door.
The doctor didn't come home all night.
Aunt Polly.
He's been sitting there like that ever since school.
Tom!
What's the matter with you?
He talked so much in his sleep, he kept me awake about half the night.
What you got on your mind, Tom?
Nothin'.
Now, don't waste my time!
I'm cookin' supper!
What ails you?
Nothin' I know of!
I know what'll cure it.
Painkiller?
Painkiller, a double dose, and right now.
And you did talk such stuff in your sleep.
You said, "blood, blood."
You said that over and over.
And you said, "I won't tell."
Tell what?
Now, you take this.
It'll cure anything.
Open your mouth.
Open your mouth!
Aah!
Now get your breath, and then you take this other spoonful.
Here! Hear what I say?
Do it!
Don't ask for it, Peter, unless you really want it.
You better make sure.
Well, all right.
But if you find you don't like it, you mustn't blame anybody but your own self.
Oh!
Tom?
What on earth ails that cat?
I don't know, aunt Polly.
I never see anything like it.
What did make him act so?
Cats always act so when they're having a good time.
Oh, they do, do they?
Did you give that cat some painkiller?
Look me in the eye.
Hmm!
Oh!
Now, sir, what you want to treat that cat so cruel for?
I done it out of pity for him
'cause he hadn't any aunt.
Hadn't any aunt, you numbskull!
What's that got to do with it?
Because if he'd had one, she'd have roasted the innards out of him without any more feeling than if he was a human.
Tom, you mustn't be cruel to dumb beasts.
What's cruel to a dumb beast might be cruel to a human, too, aunt Polly.
But, Tom, it did do you good.
Done him good, too.
I never see him get along so before.
Oh, go along with you before you aggravate me again.
Ow.
You don't whack Sid when he takes sugar.
Well, Sid don't torment a body the way you do.
Oh!
You...
Don't punish Tom, aunt Polly!
It was Sid broke it.
Well, you didn't get a lick a miss, I reckon.
You've been in plenty of other audacious mischief.
Oh!
Ain't you goin' to the church social?
Mmm... church social!
This here's chock full of potato salad and a great, big chocolate cake and pickles.
If I was to drown myself then they'd be sorry.
Ben Rogers is gonna bring a whole lot of fishin' worms to put down girls' necks.
They'd see my body layin' there all wet and stiff, then they'd dress up and cry some.
My ma was gonna whack me if I didn't put these shoes on.
Treat you like a dog.
Like a old cur dog.
Shoes!
Anybody'd think there was snow on the ground.
Burnin' you out with painkiller.
Squeezin' your feet.
Enough to make anybody run away.
I'd just as soon.
Huh?
We would never wear shoes.
We could go a thousand miles away.
We could go all over the world!
We can get Huck Finn to go with us!
We can use Huck's raft!
I'm Captain Murrell,
The one-eyed terror of the Mississippi, and if you don't dig for treasure, that's committin' mutiny.
Aw, I've walked the plank
10 times already.
I'm sick of committin' mutiny.
You're a fine old slodge of a pirate, you are.
You're a disgrace.
Then why didn't you let me be a hermit like I wanted to be?
All right, then, you're a hermit.
Hey, black avenger!
Now, go on, be a hermit.
Hey, Joe!
What's that?
Tain't thunder.
Listen. Don't talk.
Look!
Somebody's drowned.
They shoot over the water.
That makes the body come up to the top.
By jinx, I'd give heaps to know who's drowned.
Hucky?
I betcha they're lookin' for doc Robinson.
We won't find nothin' till we get down the river to where the raft was found.
How do you know that was the right raft?
Why, the poor little Harper boy's shoes was still on it, you old puddin' head!
That who's drowned... us!
Oh!
Say, Tom?
Do you suppose they really think I'm drownded?
Course they do.
Ain't ya glad?
Well, I suppose so,
But I thought maybe my mother would... well...
Your mother made you wear shoes, didn't she?
Well, yes, but, well... if she felt too bad, well, maybe I ought to go home.
What?
Well, you know, just for a visit.
Visit?
You're just scared.
Shucks, I'll bet you'll both want to go home.
Aw!
Joe?
Joe?
What?
What do you want to be when you go home?
You mean...
You mean, we're gonna go home?
In about
10 or 20 years maybe.
Oh.
10 or 20 years.
I think...
I think I'll be a general.
Then when I come home with my sword ad medals and maybe one leg off...
My grandpa's got one leg off.
Or maybe
I ought to go out west and join the Indians.
Then when I was chief,
I'd put on my feathers and war paint and come prancin' into Sunday school.
My ma always give us pancakes and molasses before Sunday school.
I know!
I'll be a pirate.
Then I could sail right up to town with my cutlass and horse pistols, and they'd all hide and say,
"Tom Sawyer, the terror of the seas, is back home again."
Yeah... back home again.
Well... well...
One thing about being a pirate,
Nobody's gonna bother you about washin' your feet.
My ma always makes me wash my feet with soap.
Yeah.
But I bet she don't smother the covers up around your neck or fuss around with your pillow every night.
Ma got me an eiderdown.
Well... anyhow, we won't have to listen to 'em in the mornin', rattlin' the dishes and talkin' and laughin' so loud and cheerful.
My ma don't laugh much in the morning, but she sings nice hymns.
Course there ain't such good swimmin' anywhere's as here, Joe.
But it ain't so much fun when there's nobody to tell you you can't go in.
I could tell you you can't go in, Joe.
I want my ma to tell me
I can't go in.
Never to see our boys again.
Oh, Mrs. Harper.
It's a poem, Mrs. Harper, to your Joe and our Tom.
Uh, read it, child.
"Our Drownded Boys" by Mary Wadsworth Sawyer.
"Alack, our broken hearts are so sad.
"Alack, our sorrow, it is so hard to measure.
"for though oftimes, they may have acted pretty bad,
"boys will be boys.
They were our fond treasure."
Now, don't take on so.
You're just wearing yourself to pieces.
Oh, I hadn't given up hope till they found the raft with Joe's little shoes on it.
Poor, abused boy.
I bet it was Tom's fault.
Now, Sidney, don't you say one word against our dear Tom...
Now that he's gone.
You better run up to bed.
Yes, aunt Polly.
Oh, Mrs. Harper,
I don't know how I can go on without my Tom.
And the last words
I ever heard him say were to reproach me.
Well, all our tears won't bring them back.
Oh, aunt Polly, don't you think you'd better try and get a little sleep now?
I reckon I'd better.
I'm all tuckered out.
Get some rest, Miss Polly dear.
Good night.
Good night, aunt Polly.
Good night.
O, God, in thine infinite mercy, watch over our innocent boys. punish me as I deserve, but not in this way.
I beg of thee.
Please. Oh, please, let their bodies be found so that I can look on my dear Tom's face once more for the last time.
Amen.
Why, Jim, why aren't you asleep?
I can't, Miss Mary.
I can't do nothin' but think about the funeral Sunday.
Now, stop thinking about Sunday.
Go on out and go to sleep, Jim.
I'll try, Miss Mary.
Tom, what are you...
What you do here?
You know they lookin' for you?
Why, them boys was my friends.
You ain't got no friend but me.
You stay hid.
Dear friends, we are gathered here to pay solemn and loving tribute to the memory of 3 fine and beautiful young boys cut off in the fullness of life's morn'.
What a model of obedience and uprightness was Joseph Harper.
Always the prop and comfort of his dear mother.
Always taking pride in being well-dressed and neat.
Yet, let us rejoice that he is now wearing celestial raiment.
And Thomas Sawyer.
I shall not speak of his kindness to man and beast alike... nor of his diligence in performing his appointed duties about the home.
Suffice it to say, in the recent words of a St. Louis editor,
"his life was gentle,
"and the elements so mixed in him
"that nature might stand up and say to all the world, this was a boy."
And last, but, oh, my friends, by no means least, the figure we all had come to love... the unfortunate, but enduring child of nature known as Huckleberry Finn.
How bravely he overcame the dismal handicaps of his parentage.
How nobly he grew in grace and became a useful member.
But now, alas, all 3 blossoming youths have crossed the great river.
They have stepped upon the sunlit shore.
Even now, they march.
They march into...
Tom! Tom! Oh!
Oh, my boy! My precious!
Joe!
Oh, Joe!
Where have you been all this time?
Who saved you?
Why, nobody.
We was just playin' pirates.
Playing pirates?!
Makin' a passel of fools out of us!
If they were mine,
I'd laugh their hide off.
Letting us think that they were drowned!
They have returned to us unharmed.
Let us give thanks.
Sing and put your hearts in it.
Playin' pirates.
Just wait till I get you home.
Praise God from whom all blessings flow
Praise him all creatures here below...
I know I did wrong to run away and let you think we was drowned, but I dreamt about you anyway.
Dream? A cat does that much.
What'd you dream?
Why, uh... why...
Thursday night, I dreamt that you, aunt Polly, were sitting on the sofa, and you were sitting on the wood box, and Mary next to you.
So we did.
So we always do.
And Joe Harper's mother was here.
Why, she was here.
Hmm.
Did you dream any more?
It seems to me that Mrs. Harper said she still has hopes until they found the raft with Joe's...
Joe's...
Try harder, Tom!
It was his shoes.
Why, it happened just so!
Mm-hmm.
Go on, Tom.
Oh, it's all getting as bright as day now. then Sid said...
I think he said... he bet it was my fault.
Mercy on us, his very words.
And you shut him up sharp.
I certainly did.
And then you went to bed.
Don't tell me there ain't anything in dreams.
Sereny Harper'll know of this before I'm a minute older!
Hmm!
"Oh, it's all getting as bright as day now."
Trash!
That's what happened, wasn't it?
Purty thin... as long a dream as that without any mistakes in it.
Huh!
Sid?
Yah, you missed me!
Tom!
You, Tom!
I have a good notion to skin you alive!
You!
What have I done, aunt Polly?
Here I go over to Sereny Harper with all that rubbish about that dream, and, lo and behold, she found out from Joe you was over here and heard all the talk we had that night!
Oh, Tom, I don't know what's to become of a boy that will act the way you do.
I know now it was mean, aunt Polly,
But I didn't mean to be mean.
Honest, I didn't.
And besides, I didn't come over here to laugh at you that night.
Well, what did you come over here for then?
To tell you not to worry about us
'cause we hadn't got drowned.
I'd give the whole world to believe that, but it ain't reasonable.
Because why didn't you tell me, child?
Well, you see,
When I heard talkin' about the funeral,
I got the idea of hidin' in the church, so I put the bark back in my pocket and kept mum.
Bark? What bark?
The bark I wrote on to tell you we'd gone pirate.
Why, it's still in the pocket of my old coat.
You can look and see if you don't believe me.
I wish now you'd wake up when I kissed you.
I do, honest.
Did you kiss me, Tom?
Why, yes, I did, aunt Polly.
Now, what'd you kiss me for?
Because I love you so, and you laid there moanin', and I was so sorry.
Kiss me again, Tom.
Go on to school now.
And don't bother me mo more.
Yeah, you didn't fool me.
Aunt Polly!
I never did nobody any harm before.
You'll all say that.
I didn't know what I was doin'.
I hope... I hope to die this minute if I did.
Hey, Tom.
They found doc Robinson's body and arrested Muff.
But Muff didn't kill him.
Injun Joe says he did, and Muff thinks he did.
But we saw.
What are we gonna do?
Do? Nothin'.
Do you wanna drop down dead in your tracks and rot?
Ohh.
Hear ye, hear ye,
The State of Missoura vs. Clarence Potter, alias Muff Potter.
Death was due to an incisive trauma of the heart inflicted by a knife.
It's Muff Potter's knife, all right.
I sold it to him last October.
Sure, I could see Muff stab him.
I was as close as I am to you.
That's all.
The state rests.
Your honor, I ask for an adjournment until tomorrow morning.
Adjournment? For what?
To prepare my address to the jury, which'll be our only defense.
You will introduce no witnesses?
We've been unable to find any.
Here's some more tobaccer, Muff.
And here's some real Lucifer matches.
Thank you, boys.
You've been mighty good to me, better than anybody else in this town.
And often I says to myself, says I,
"I used to show the boys where the good fishin' places was
"and befriend 'em what I could,
And now they all forgot ol' Muff when he's in trouble."
But Tom don't, and Huck don't.
And I don't forget them, either.
It's a prime comfort to look on faces that's friendly when a body's in such a muck of trouble.
Good friendly faces. Heh.
Shake hands.
Little hands.
But they've helped
Muff Potter a power.
They'd help more if they could.
...tell the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth, so help me.
Thomas Sawyer, where were you on the 17th of June, about the hour of midnight?
Where were you on the night of June 17, about 12 of the clock?
Where were you at midnight on June 17?
In the graveyard.
A little louder, please.
Don't be afraid.
You were...
Ahem. In the graveyard!
What did you take there?
Only a...
A dead cat.
And, uh, just what were you going to do with your dead cat?
We was gonna take our warts off with him.
See, you take your cat along about midnight.
You go get in the graveyard where somebody wicked's been buried.
Your honor, since we must be exposed to all this boyish prattle about a dead cat, may I ask the cat where is the feline corpus delicti?
We will produce the skeleton of that cat.
Now, when you were in the graveyard, were you anywhere near
Horse Williams' grave?
Yes, sir.
Speak up a little louder.
How near were you?
Near as I am to you.
Were you hidden?
Where you hidden or not?
I was hid.
Where?
Up in a tree.
And now, my boy, tell us everything that occurred.
Tell it in your own way, don't skip anything, and don't be afraid.
We saw the fight.
Muff got knocked unconscious.
He didn't kill doc Robinson!
The one that stabbed him was...
Somebody get him!
Whoa!
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Yay! Muff is free.
...in the bright, blue sky
They'll warble a song to me...
I got something for you.
It will make me glad
To think they are happy and free
If ever I see
On bush or tree
Young birds in their pretty nest
I must not in play
Steal the young birds away
To grieve their mother's breast
My mother...
Yoo-hoo. Tom.
All right, children, let's go to the cave!
Everybody!
Hey, wait for me!
All right, children.
Come on.
Attaboy.
Come and get your candles.
Everybody get candles down here.
Don't go out of sight of the entrance, children.
We won't, Miss Jenkins.
Yoo-hoo! Tom!
Wait for us.
Tom! Wait for Sidney and me!
Hurry, Becky!
Hurry!
They're gonna catch us!
Oh, look, Becky. Look.
Isn't it pretty?
It's just like Fairyland.
Come on under.
You won't get wet.
Thank you.
What is it?
Cake, but it's not to eat.
Just what I wanted.
Give it here, Tom, please!
Thomas, you give me that cake!
I promise I won't eat any of it, Becky.
All right, then. I'll trust you.
It's so still in here, Tom.
I don't hear any of the others.
Yes. We better start back.
Look, Becky.
It's just like a king's throne.
Yes.
Come on, Tom. Let's hurry.
It's this way.
Come on, everybody!
Time to go home!
Hurry up, children!
Come on. Come on, children.
Bats! Look out, Becky!
They'll get in your hair!
Miss Jenkins!
Mr. Sherrell!
Oh, Tom, the king's throne again.
We must have gone in a circle.
Tom...
Maybe there's 2 of 'em.
No, we're lost.
I am sort of mixed-up.
Oh, why did we ever leave the others?
Don't be scared.
I ain't scared.
Nothing to be scared of.
I'm not scared with you along.
Sure. I'll get you out of here.
Why, I wasn't scared in the courtroom when Injun Joe threw his... knife at me.
I would be scared with any other boy but you.
Yeah.
Tom!
What was that?
That rock moved.
Come on. Duck under.
I'll hold it.
Ooh.
Golly.
Maybe they're hunting for us now.
Sure they are.
Take this.
Miss Jenkins!
Mr. Sherrell!
Miss Jenkins!
Mr. Sherrell!
Aah!
I'm not hurt, Becky.
Hold the torch over.
What are you scared of?
Ohh!
We had a fine time.
Ha ha! Ha ha! How was it?
Well, where's Tom?
Why, he must be on the other wagon.
Uh-huh. Tom! Yo, Tom!
No, he isn't here.
That's strange.
Wonder where he is.
I was sure he was in the other wagon.
Well, who saw him last?
I guess I did.
He was with Becky Thatcher in the cave.
Well, then ask Becky.
Becky! Becky!
Becky!
She's not here.
Is Becky Thatcher in your wagon?
Becky. Becky.
No. She's not here.
They must be together in the cave.
In the cave?
Lost in the caves.
Lost in the cave.
Lost in the caves.
Lost in the cave.
Come on.
I got a driver.
Mark your way as you go.
We don't want anybody else lost in here.
Now split up, men.
Some of you men search the other passages.
No sign of 'em down there.
Nothin' here, judge.
Well, must've turned off before they got this far.
Come on.
Hey, wait a minute. Look.
There's a hole back here and footprints.
Footprints. Footprints.
Come on!
Let's have a look.
That's there, sure.
I been in this cave a hundred times, but never this far. Come on.
Becky!
Tom!
Becky!
Becky! Tom!
Wait. I'll fire a shot.
Shh.
Did you hear that?
It's them!
They're comin'!
We're all right now!
Miss Jenkins!
Mr. Sherrell!
Miss Jenkins!
Mr. Sherrell!
Here we are, in this cave!
Over here.
What's that? Shh!
Mr. Sherrell.
Did you hear that?
It's them.
Hey, judge, look.
Miss Jenkins!
Mr. Sherrell!
They must've gone through there.
Come on.
Look out, judge!
Ehh!
You hurt, judge?
Tom...
We can't get through.
Can we?
What are we gonna do?
There's nothing we can do.
It's hopeless.
We couldn't clear that out in 6 months.
Becky, you mustn't.
Please don't.
I can't help it.
If only I had my mother and...
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, in earth as it is in heaven.
There. Ain't it fun havin' a fire?
Yes, but...
Tom, I'm so hungry.
Did you forget this?
I saved it from the picnic for us to dream on, the way grown-up people do.
Well, couldn't we make a wish on it?
We could try.
I wish...
I wish it was as big as a barrel.
It's good and long.
It's my kite string.
You hold on to this end of it,
And I'll unwind it down some of the tunnels.
Oh, no.
Please don't leave me.
I've got to.
We've gotta do something.
I'll take half of the candle and leave half for you.
Now don't let go of it.
I won't.
Why don't you sing, Becky, and you won't be lonesome.
If ever I see
On bush or... tree
Young birds in their pretty nest
I must not in play
Steal the young birds away
To grieve their mother's breast
If ever I see
On bush or tree...
My mother, I know
Would sorrow so
Tom!
Tom! Tom!
Wowie!
Tom!
Aah!
If Injun...
If he got in here, there must be some way out.
Let's look.
Becky! Becky!
But you gotta, Becky!
Becky!
There's light! Look!
Come on!
Please, Becky! Please!
I'll be back, Becky.
I'll be back for you!
Becky, it's getting brighter!
Becky, can you hear me?!
It's getting brighter!
Becky, there's light!
Becky!
Becky, I'm comin' for you.
And then this heroic boy actually went back into that awful darkness and somehow, some way, brought our Becky out to safety.
No common place boy could have done that, no boy other than the noble lad whom I now present to you, Tom Sawyer.
Where's Tom?
Where is he?
I saw him leave with massuh Huckleberry.
Here they are!
I got 'em!
Here they are!
They're rich!
Tom and Huck are rich!
They found Murrell's treasure.
Excellent, boys.
You did it, son.
Tom, you're a hero.
Don't forget, we're engaged.
Come on, folks. strawberry shortcake.
Oh, Sid.
Aunt Polly!
Why, Tom might even be President someday.
Aunt Polly,
Tom went and...
If they don't hang him first.

Boys, keep quiet.
My father owned a small estate in Nottinghamshire.
I was third of his sons.
In my youth i occupied myself with medicine, after that i sailed for some years as a ship suregon.
Once i sailed on 'Antelope' to South Ocean.
It was stormy weather, big waves washed over deck and deafening wind blew in the sails.
Then I noticed a ship with black sails.
Those were the pirates.
Their fast brig ramed into 'Antelope', the impact was so heavy that i went overdoard and fell on the deck of pirates' ship.
Horrible crash was heard and poor 'Antelope' went down with all its crew.
"By thousand devils!" pirates shouted "All sorts of old boats are slouching around!"
Meanwile the storm...
Boatswain!
Everybody in their places!
Get out, lazybones! To work!
Oh, you, mariners!
Who are you?

Hey, old jackal, don't dare to touch [that] kid!
I will teach you...
Sit down! ???
Doctor Gulliver, i'm Vanya. Let's shake hands!
Hands up, bandits! Or you will have a bomb for breakfast.
Thrown down [your] weapons!

Then he will fall together with them.
Right! We will bring down any mountain.

Let's try to sidetrack his attention.
And then?
Then to attract his attention.
I announce private concert in honour of our high guest!
Royal corps de ballet!
Do something to amuse him!
In a moment!
Royal dwarfs - microputs.
Dwarfs at your place?
Amazing!
Give [them] closer!
Why do you beat them!
So that they would work better.
Do you beat everybody who works for you?
Don't talk nonsense! We don't...lay our hands on anybody.
I want to know how your folk is living.
Folk?
Please, please...song about how we're living.
Under king's wise guidance earth is in bloom, fields are in bloom and we are singing
Our folk is content with life, it always sings and doesn't expect tears.
...we have no worries, we have no worries.
She's lying!
Lying?
Perhaps, you can sing more veritable?
Let's give it a try.
Horn is blowing, we're youth of the nation, we're growing up in world of labour.
Blow, horn, under the sun of freedom!
Pioneers' star is burning.
Horn is blowing. Fly to distant lands, our call!
Blow, horn, over all oceans flies wave of our songs.
Horn is blowing. We will change the land.
Blow, horn, so that in future world lived free and happy man.
Workers all around the world, rise up!
I haven't received such note yet.
I said: kill him immediately.
Let's do so.
Such petty souls!
Prepare weapons and ammunition to use against Gulliver immediately!
I hear that, mister chief of the police!
These weapons are to be used agains Gulliver...let's warn him.
Let's warn Gulliver.
Let's warn him.
Guys, leave me in peace!
Come on, guys!
Was it you who woke me up?
Quieter, Petya! Spies are around! They can hear us.
How do you know me?
Form your exercize-book.
Oh, native language.
That language is our mother tongue, too.
I'm from workers of underground factory.
Finally! Greetings!
Petya, beware!
[they] want to kill you.
Everything is going well. Ammunition will be prepared.
Excellent.
What? 100? - Little. - 200? - Little. - 300? - Little.
So remeber, be prepared tomorrow.
Always ready!
Come here at once!
Gulliver knows everything.
Workers warned Gulliver.

A CHRISTMAS CAROL
Hark! the herald angels sing
"Glory to the newborn King
Peace on earth and mercy mild,
God and sinners reconciled!"
Joyful, all ye nations rise;
Join the triumph of the skies;
With angelic host proclaim
"Christ is born in Bethlehem!"
Hark! the herald angels sing
"Glory to the newborn King!"
MORE THAN A CENTURY AGO...
IN LONDON... ON CHRISTMAS EVE.
Have a try at it.
Coo, governor, that was a slide.
- It was good, wasn't it?
- I should say.
You beat the record, that's what you did.
Did I, now?
Look at Albert.
He fell!
- Don't you like sliding, son?
- Yes, sir. It's great sport.
Come on then.
Try and beat my record.
No, thank you, governor.
I'm not very good at running.
Here. Get up on my back.
We'll show them how to slide.
Thank you, sir.
- What's your name, youngster?
- Tim, sir. Thank you, sir.
- Well, come on, Tim. Here we go.
- Thank you.
We'll really do this slide.
We'll make a record together.
Here we go now!
Hold tight.
There we are.
Wasn't that lovely?
It was wonderful.
It made my stomach all wobbly-like.
- Yes. We're a team, that's what we are.
- I don't suppose you ever fall down.
- Like Albert.
- Fall down?
Who, me? No.
- Well, sir?
- I am sorry, governor.
I didn't mean to hit you, sir.
Please don't be angry with him, sir.
He's my brother.
In that case,
I've only one reason to be angry.
He broke my record.
- What's your name?
- Cratchit, sir. Peter Cratchit.
He's my brother, Tim Cratchit.
- Not Bob Cratchit's sons?
- Why, yes, sir.
I know your father well.
In truth, I was on my way to his place of work when we met.
Maybe he'll take the message for us, Pete.
As you'll be seeing him, sir, you might do me the favor... of giving him this list of things my mother wants him to fetch.
- Certainly.
- It's very nice of you to do that, sir.
Not a bit of it, Peter.
I'm more than willing.
Well, that is jolly.
Don't you two lads want to see your father?
And on Christmas Eve, too?
It ain't that we don't want to see our own father, sir.
It's the man our father works for we don't want to see. Mr. Scrooge.
I don't think he's very fond of small boys, sir.
Yes. I understand.
You see, I knew Mr. Scrooge... when I was a small boy.
He's my uncle.
Come on now, Bob.
Aren't you going to wish me a merry Christmas?
Mr. Fred, I am sorry. When you came in and stood there like that...
I thought it was your uncle.
A merry Christmas, sir.
A merry Christmas to you, Bob, and to your family.
I've already paid my respects to part of your brood.
Peter and Tim, their names were.
They asked me to give you this list from their mother.
Thank you. They shouldn't have made it an errand for you.
I was pleased to do it.
It's cold in here.
You think we could have some coal on the fire?
Oh, yes.
It's against the regulations, isn't it?
Mr. Scrooge doesn't like to waste coal, sir.
I foresaw that and provided for it.
This'll make the place less bleak.
- What might that be?
- It's a wine bottle.
A cheering, warming, goodly wine.
A wine that'll race through your veins... with little torches. It's port, Bob.
The fifth essence of the Christmas spirit.
But we haven't got a glass.
I'll get one from Mr. Scrooge's office.
- What is this?
- Cough medicine.
Yeah, I thought so.
We will.
- We will have some more coal.
- Good man, Bob.
Come on now, Bob.
Let's drink a loving cup. You sweeten it.
- Another merry Christmas, Mr. Fred.
- Yes.
A merry Christmas to you, Uncle.
God save you.
Humbug!
Christmas, humbug?
Uncle, I'm sure you don't mean that.
Humbug I said, and humbug I mean.
Merry Christmas.
What right have you to be merry?
- You're poor enough.
- What right have you to be dismal?
- You're rich enough.
- Humbug.
Now, Uncle, don't be cross.
What else can I be when I live in such a world of fools?
Merry Christmas.
What's Christmastime, but a time for paying bills without money?
A time for finding yourself a year older and not an hour richer.
If I could work my will, every idiot that goes about with "merry Christmas"... on his lips should be boiled with his own pudding... and buried with a stake of holly through his heart.
- Uncle!
- Nephew!
Keep Christmas in your own way, and let me keep it in mine.
- But you don't keep it.
- Let me leave it alone then.
Much good it has ever done you.
Uncle, there are many things which have made me happy.
Things which have never fattened my purse by even that much.
Christmas is one of these.
I've always looked on Christmas as a good time... a kind, charitable, forgiving, pleasant time.
It's the only time when people open their hearts freely.
The only time when men and women seem to realize... that all human beings are really members of the same family.
And that being members of the same family... they owe each other some measure of warmth and solace.
And therefore, Uncle, though it's never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pockets...
I believe that it has done me good, and will do me good.
And I say, God bless it!
Let me hear another sound from you... and you'll keep Christmas by losing your situation.
You're quite a powerful speaker, sir.
- I wonder you don't go into Parliament.
- Uncle, don't be angry.
Come now. Come and dine with Bess and me tomorrow.
- Bess?
- Yes. Elizabeth, my fiancee.
I'm dining with her people,
I'm sure they'd welcome a visit from you.
- So you're engaged?
- Yes.
May I ask why?
- Because I fell in love.
- Because you fell in love.
You intend to marry?
As soon as I'm earning enough money.
Has she tried her relatives?
- That wasn't the reason for my visit.
- Good afternoon.
Uncle, I ask nothing from you.
I want nothing from you.
There's no reason why we should be enemies.
Good afternoon.
Uncle, I made this visit in homage to Christmas, and I'll keep... my Christmas spirit to the last.
And so, Uncle, a merry Christmas.
- Good afternoon.
- And a happy new year.
Good afternoon!
A merry Christmas to you, Bob.
Thank you, sir. A merry Christmas to you and to your wife-to-be.
Thank you.
- A merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.
- And the same to you, sirs.
- Thank you.
- Scrooge and Marley's, I believe.
- Yes, sir.
I have the pleasure of addressing Mr. Marley?
- No, sir.
- Then you're Mr. Scrooge.
- No.
- My name is Scrooge.
- And my name is Twill.
- And mine is Rummidge.
And Mr. Marley?
Mr. Marley's been dead these seven years.
- He died seven years ago this very night.
- On Christmas Eve?
As good a time as any.
We have no doubt that Mr. Marley's liberality is well represented... by his surviving partner.
At this festive season of the year,
Mr. Scrooge... it is more than usually desirable that some slight provision be made... for the poor and destitute.
Many thousands are in want, sir, in need of common necessaries.
Hundreds of thousands are in want of common comforts, sir.
- Are there no prisons?
- Plenty of prisons.
And the workhouses, are they still in operation?
They are. Though I wish with all my heart they were not.
I was afraid from what you said at first that something had occurred... to stop them in their useful course.
Under the impression these places can scarcely furnish Christmas cheer... for the mind and body of the multitude... a few of us have endeavored to form a fund for the poor, to buy them food... and drink, and means of warmth.
What can I put you down for, sir?
Nothing.
You wish to be anonymous?
I wish to be left alone.
Since you asked me what I wish, gentlemen, that is my answer.
I help to support the institutions
I mentioned. They cost enough... and those who are badly off must go there.
Many can't go there, and many would rather die.
If they'd rather die, they'd better do it and decrease the surplus population.
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
In that case, we must apologize for interrupting you, sir.
Humbug!
You keep close watch on the closing hour.
- It's half an hour past, sir.
- Then close up.
Thank you, sir.
Don't work overtime.
You might make something of yourself.
- You'll want all day tomorrow, I suppose?
- Lf it's quite convenient, sir.
It's not convenient, and it's not fair.
If I was to stop half a crown for it, you'd consider yourself ill-used...
I'll be bound.
It's only once a year, sir.
A poor excuse for picking a man's pocket every 25th of December.
However, I suppose you'll have to have the whole day.
Be here all the earlier next morning.
- Yes, sir.
- Then be off.
Well?
My wages, sir. They fall due today.
Can't wait to spend them?
Thank you, sir.
You rascal! You want more?
Now look here, boys, just because a fellow wears a hat, you know... it doesn't mean he can't throw a snowball.
I used to do a lot of snowballing... and I found the best way to make a snowball was to take the snow into... your bare hands, like this, and then... crunch it together until the warmth from your hands...
Here!
Look who's coming down the street.
A blooming topper.
- Come on, governor. Show us.
- Right you are. Here, give me room.
Half a more.
Let her go!
A bull's-eye!
I had no idea it was you, master.
No idea at all. Truly, master.
No doubt this is your idea of a Christmas joke.
I'll get your hat, sir.
I didn't know, sir. The coach, it...
Cratchit, I told you before that I could find a man more capable than yourself.
- I need say no more.
- You mean, I'm sacked, sir?
Exactly.
But in my papers, sir, it says I must have a week's notice.
Your week's salary will recompense me for the price of a new hat. No.
As this hat cost 16 and 6, and your salary is 15 and 6... you owe me a shilling.
I say, governor, we are sorry.
The old stinker.
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!
I'd like to buy a goose.
About 5 and 8 pence.
Certainly, sir.
- That's the one.
- A very good choice, sir.
Here, let me help you.
4 penneth of potatoes,
6 penneth of mixed nuts...
6 penneth of apples.
The special pippins, sir, or the medium cookers?
- The special pippins.
- Yes, sir.
And 6... No, 8 penneth of oranges.
Thank you, sir.
Chestnuts.
Chestnuts, sir? All hot, sir.
They warm the innards and cheer the heart.
- What's Christmas without chestnuts, sir?
- What indeed.
2 penneth... No, 3 penneth.
- Yes, sir.
- Put them in my back pocket.
- Yes. I will, sir.
- That's it.
- There you are, sir.
- Now the other one.
- Here we are.
- And here's your 3 pence.
- And a merry Christmas.
- Thank you, sir.
- Bob, you have got a load.
- Haven't I, though?
And all for tomorrow.
Let me help you.
- Did you get the oranges?
- Yes.
- And the lemons?
- Yes.
- And the potatoes?
- Yes.
Oh, bless me.
- How did you carry it all?
- I really don't know.
- What's this?
- Guess.
- Roast of beef.
- No. Try again.
- Veal.
- No.
- Tripe.
- No.
- Ribs.
- No.
- I know. Sausages.
- No. Goose.
Look!
Now take it all into the kitchen.
Save Mother a step.
Let me carry something.
- Here, Tim, you may carry the neck.
- Thank you.
Go over to the fire and have a warm, Bob.
Yes, dear.
- Did you get the day off tomorrow?
- Without hardly any trouble at all.
- Wasn't Mr. Scrooge angry?
- Well, you might say he was...
- and you might say he wasn't.
- Meaning what, Bob?
Meaning I got the day off and we don't want to talk about Mr. Scrooge tonight.
Come here, you monkeys, and see what I've got.
Chestnuts!
Marley!
Humbug.
- Who are you?
- Ask me who I was.
Who were you then?
In life, I was your partner, Jacob Marley.
Well...
- what do you want?
- Much.
- You don't believe in me?
- I don't.
What proof would you have of my reality beyond that of your own senses?
- I don't know.
- Why do you doubt your senses?
Because a little thing affects them.
A slight disorder of the stomach makes them liars.
You may be an undigested bit of beef, a blot of mustard, or a crumb of cheese.
Humbug, I tell you. Humbug!
Silence!
Watch! There's an intruder in my room.
- Right up, sir. Law and order.
- Here's my key. Make haste.
Good.
We'll soon see how real you are.
I made this visit for your welfare,
Ebenezer Scrooge.
- In here.
- Right-o.
There he is. Out with him!
Your intruder seems to have extruded, if I may say so, governor.
He was here when I opened the door.
He was a spirit. Someone I know.
Of course, a spirit.
A great night for spirits, sir, of one sort or another.
Meaning, governor, we wouldn't mind a bit of spirit ourselves.
You may leave!
Indigestion, that's what it was.
Out with you!
Sorry we couldn't be of any assistance, governor.
Perhaps the next spirits you have, we can.
Man of the worldly mind.
- Now do you believe in me?
- I do. I must.
But why? Why do you trouble me?
It is required of every man that the spirit within him should walk abroad... among his fellow men.
If that spirit goes not forth in life, it must do so after death.
- You are bound in heavy chains.
- I wear the chain I forged in life.
Is its pattern strange to you?
The chain you will bear was full as heavy and as long as this... seven Christmas Eves ago.
It must be a ponderous chain by now.
Jacob. Old Jacob Marley...
- have you no comfort for me?
- None.
And none for myself.
In life, my spirit never walked beyond... the narrow limits of our money-changing hole... and weary journeys lie before me.
- You travel fast?
- On the wings of the wind.
You must have covered a great quantity of ground in seven years.
Captive, bound, and double-ironed.
No space of regret can make amends for the wasted opportunities of one life.
Poor and ignorant Scrooge.
Yet, such was I.
But you were always a good man of business, Jacob.
Business. Mankind was my business.
The common welfare was my business.
Charity, mercy, forbearance, and benevolence... all these were my business.
It is at this time of the year that I suffer most.
To see the want I could have stopped, the suffering I could have solaced.
The hunger I could have satisfied.
Hear me.
My time is nearly gone.
If you must go, Jacob, don't let me keep you.
I have sat invisible beside you many and many a day.
I am here to warn you that you have one chance of escaping my fate.
- One chance, Ebenezer Scrooge.
- What is it?
You will be haunted by three spirits.
Is that the chance you mentioned, Jacob?
It is.
I think I'd rather not.
Unless you suffer these three visitations, your fate will be the same as mine.
Jacob. Don't leave me yet. Jacob!
Expect the first when the bell tolls 1:00... the second on the stroke of 2:00... the third on the last vibration of 3:00.
Couldn't I take all three at once and have it over?
Remember, the first at 1:00... the second at 2:00, the third at 3:00.
Humbug.
- Are you the spirit I was told to expect?
- I am.
- Who are you?
- I am the Ghost of Christmas Past.
The light. It hurts my eyes.
- It blinds me.
- I'm not surprised.
It's the warming light of thankfulness... the light of gratitude to others.
- I've never seen it before.
- Of course not.
It's men of greed like you who have long forgotten gratitude.
What's your business with me?
Your welfare. Your reclamation.
Rise and walk with me.
- We spirits have no fear.
- But I'm not a spirit.
Bear but the touch of my hand on your heart, and you shall be safe.
Good heaven! This is my old school!
I was a boy here.
Merry Christmas!
Harry, Joe, Tommy, Percy and Dick!
Dick Wilkins!
These are but shadows of things that have been.
They have no consciousness of us.
You knew them?
I went to school with them, all of them.
- Your lip is trembling.
- The cold.
- Let's continue. You remember this way?
- Remember it?
I could walk it blindfold.
Strange to have forgotten it for so many years.
- That is myself.
- Was yourself.
Was.
What is that upon your cheek?
Nothing. The cold.
Listen.
Goodbye, young Scrooge.
Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas, Jack.
- Your parents coming for you?
- No. I'm staying at school for the holidays.
- You are?
Always do, you know?
Father and I talked it over.
We decided that some extra swatting at my studies would do me more good than...
Christmas at home.
Christmas, plum pudding and turkeys... that's just for children.
I say, your governor must be a crusty old bird.
- He knows what's best.
- Jack, hurry!
Right-o. I didn't mean anything against your father, Eb. Good luck.
Merry Christmas!
- Master Scrooge.
- Yes, sir?
Your sister's come to see you.
Ebbie, dear Ebbie.
I've come to bring you home.
Home, Fran? Home?
Father is so much kinder than he used to be... that home is like heaven.
That's why I asked him if you could come home, and he said, "Yes."
And he sent me to fetch you with a coach.
And, Ebbie, Father says that you're going to go to work... and never come back here.
And we're going to have a turkey and chestnuts and everything.
God bless you, Fran.
Ebbie, it's going to be so glorious.
God bless you.
- She loved you.
- She did.
I believe she had children before she died.
- One child.
- Your nephew, Fred.
Come.
You remember this place?
Fezziwig's warehouse.
I was apprenticed here.
It's old Fezziwig.
It's old Fezziwig alive again.
Ebenezer, Dick!
Yes, sir?
Ebenezer Scrooge, Dick Wilkins.
Yes, sir?
Do you observe the time, sir?
7:05, sir.
Do you know you've let me work you five minutes overtime?
No more work tonight.
Christmas Eve, Dick. Christmas, Ebenezer.
Up with the shutters. Close up shop.
In the eye, Dick. Cheer up, Ebenezer.
What a lark.
He always comes through, doesn't he?
- Always comes through does old Fezziwig.
- And royally, too.
And royally, too.
Nothing's too good for Fezziwig.
Closed up tight, sirs?
- Tight as a barrel, sir.
- Good.
Now, about tomorrow.
It's a holiday, of course.
But I shall expect you to spend part of it, at least, with me... eating Christmas dinner.
Thank you, sir.
And as probably you'll eat too much to be any good next day... we'll make that a holiday, too.
Good night, Ebenezer. Good night, Dick.
Good night, sir. And thank you, sir.
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
- A sovereign.
- A whole sovereign.
- Solid gold is old Fezziwig.
- Solid gold, through and through.
What is the matter?
Nothing particular.
Something, I think.
Yes, there is.
Old Fezziwig was very kind to me.
Yes, he was. But he's dead now.
Perhaps you feel you'd like to repay his kindness to you.
Well?
You have a clerk, Bob Cratchit.
Old Fezziwig would have been very happy... if you had shown your gratitude to him by showing kindness to others.
Your clerk, for instance.
Business is business.
I'm a good businessman!
My time grows short.
I have yet to show you the black years of your life.
Your gradual enslavement to greed.
- Your ruthlessness.
- No!
Your ingratitude.
Your wretched thirst for gold.
No, leave me. I can't stand more.
I can't stand more!
Come here.
Come here and know me better, Scrooge.
I am the Ghost of Christmas Present.
Have you never seen the like of me before?
Never.
And have you never known my elder brothers, born these years before me?
I'm afraid I haven't.
Have you had many brothers, Spirit?
A huge number. Some...
A tremendous family to provide for.
What are we going to do?
Walk into the world this Christmas night, so that you can... hear and see and feel Christmas in the world this night.
Did you say "walk" or "fly"?
Touch my robe.
Good morning, and a merry, merry Christmas to you.
Merry Christmas to you.
These people, what are they doing?
The poor find it cheaper to bring their dinners to the baker to be cooked.
Now then, watch who you're stepping on.
Watch who I'm stepping on? I like that.
- Go on, off it.
- I will not!
Why you little...
- Here, let's make it up.
- Frightened?
I wouldn't touch your old hand.
I wouldn't...
Well, you're not such a bad sort after all.
Thank you, and a merry Christmas to you.
And the same to you.
What do you sprinkle from that horn that made them stop quarreling?
It's a spirit... five times distilled, the spirit of Christmas cheer... of love, of all that's good... of all that makes this time of year different from any other time.
Is there a peculiar flavor in what you sprinkle?
An excellent flavor.
Would it apply to any kind of dinner?
To a poor one most.
Why to a poor one most?
Because it needs it most.
Look where you're going, you big, clumsy ox, you. I'll...
I'll shove those words down your nasty little throat.
Stop shoving, will you?
Stop it, I say, or I'll...
Here we are being silly, aren't we now?
Like a couple of infants.
I say, I know a nice little pub where they sell hot rum and gin.
- We stopped that.
- Yes, we did, didn't we?
That church.
We have business there. Come.
O come, all ye faithful
Joyful and triumphant
O come ye,
O come ye to Bethlehem
Come and behold Him
Born the King of Angels!
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
Christ the Lord
Oh, sing, choirs of angels
I don't believe for a minute that they love one another.
What makes you say that, Spirit?
It is obvious that they love each other dearly.
Nevertheless, don't you think that... it's lucky that they haven't the wherewithal to get married?
Their love will soon fade.
I take exception to that!
On the contrary,
I think their love would grow.
I... They...
They should be married.
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
Christ the Lord
Yea, Lord we greet thee
Born this happy morning
Jesus to Thee be all glory given
Word of the Father
Now in flesh appearing
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
Christ the Lord
Amen
- Good morning and merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas to you.
Bob, a merry Christmas to you.
This is my fiancee, Bess.
This is Mr. Cratchit, and his son Tim.
How do you do?
Now, Tim, no secrets.
What were you saying?
I said, sir...
- I said she's very pretty.
- Tim!
- Thank you kindly, Tim.
- Don't you agree with him, Bob?
- Yes, sir. She is very pretty.
- Father!
Thank you kindly, Mr. Cratchit.
- Good morning.
- Goodbye.
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.
Come on, darling. Let's have a slide.
But, Fred, you can't.
Can't I?
You should have seen me yesterday.
But in front of the church? It isn't right.
But, darling, it looks perfect.
It is perfect.
- It's as slippery as a codfish's tummy.
- No, Fred, no!
But, darling, just one slide. Only one.
- Yeah.
- Well, all right.
Boys! Sliding in front of the church?
Now run away home.
And a merry Christmas to you all.
- Run home.
- See?
But, darling, he has no soul.
He's simply acting like a grownup.
I still say he has no soul.
He just doesn't appreciate the qualities of a good slide.
Come on.
One, two, three.
- Giddyap.
- Merry Christmas, Tom.
And a merry Christmas to you, Bob.
- And to you, too, Tiny Tim.
- Thank you. Merry Christmas, sir.
Spirit, tell me if Tiny Tim will live.
If the shadows remain unaltered by the future, the child will die.
No!
Surely he'll be spared.
With the kind of care that money can buy, who could tell?
But Bob Cratchit has no money.
Not even a position, I've heard.
If all this remains unaltered by the future... the next Christmas will not find Tiny Tim here.
But what of it?
If he be like to die, he'd better do it and decrease the population.
Come.
Mother! The goose, we smelled it.
Outside the baker's.
- We did, didn't we?
- It was ours. We knew.
Because of the smell.
Young, sharp noses. Out you go.
What's got into your father and Tim?
And Martha wasn't this late last Christmas by half an hour.
Here's Martha, Mother.
Here she is, Mother. Here's Martha.
There's a goose for Christmas, Martha.
Bless your heart.
I was afraid you weren't coming.
We'd a deal of sewing to finish up last night, and this morning... we had to clear up the shop.
Just so long as you've come.
- You're cold, child.
- Not very.
Sit down by the fire and have a warm.
Father's here, Mama.
- Hide.
- Hide in here.
Here we come.
Whoa it is. Hello.
There we are.
Belinda.
- Where's our Martha?
- Not coming.
Not coming?
Not coming on Christmas day?
Martha girl.
Come, Tim, into the back.
Smell the pudding.
- Was it a good service, Bob?
- Beautiful. That's what it was.
I wish you'd been there.
So long as you and Tim were there,
I feel it did us all good.
- Here, I'll give that gravy what for.
- Thank you, dear.
Belinda, you sweeten up the applesauce.
- I have, Mommy. It's on the table.
- Good girl.
- Peter, take this chair inside.
- Yes, Mother.
Now, I'm going to take one last look at the table.
What a Christmas!
There never was such a Christmas.
Here, Martha, taste this.
Sweet enough?
- Well, it's still a wee bit sour.
- So.
- Been working hard, Father?
- Yes.
How's old Scrooge?
- Same as ever.
- What's the matter?
Not a thing. Not a single blessed thing.
Something at the office?
No. Why, it was only yesterday
Mr. Scrooge came to me... shook my hand and, "Cratchit," he says, "Cratchit, my lad"... he calls me "my lad"...
"You're one in 1,000. You're..."
Something is wrong. What is it?
- I've been sacked, Martha.
- Father!
- When was it?
- Last night.
You haven't told Mother?
Bad luck.
Sorry I told you. I really shouldn't have.
I thought it might make me feel better.
Bob!
There's Mother. Come along. Cheer up.
Here we go.
Here we are!
How's that?
You know, I don't think there is anyone, not anyone, who can touch my punch.
Nor do I, Bob.
- Do you like our table?
- It's beautiful, my dear.
- Peter.
- Yes, Mother?
You can go to the baker's now.
- And get the goose?
- Yes.
The goose!
There never was such a goose.
- It's a good bird, Bob.
- And reasonable, too.
- I'd like to stroke it.
- Tim.
- We haven't eaten it all at last.
- That we haven't.
And now the pudding.
Belinda and me'll clear, Mother.
- I'll help with the pudding, Mother.
- No, I'd rather do it alone.
- It might not turn out.
- Of course it will. It always has.
Unless someone's climbed into the back and stolen it.
Stolen it?
Hurry, Mother, hurry!
Pass them over to this side.
It's there. The pudding's there.
- Hooray!
- Come along.
I smell it. Do you smell it, Peter?
That's the cloth coming off.
- The holly's in.
- It is?
It's blazing.
Here it comes! Here comes the pudding.
- Off with the lights.
- Off with the lights. Hurry.
Hurry up.
It did turn out, and it's not stolen.
- It looks so good.
- Tim.
It looks like the best you've ever made, my dear.
Bob, you say that every year.
Every year they get better.
How that's possible, don't ask me.
But it's true.
So eat.
Mother, you haven't got any.
I don't want any, dear.
- You must. Here, have some of mine.
- Just a little spoonful.
I'm sure I'm going to burst.
Not in here, my lad.
If you want to burst, you go outside.
You've hardly any tummy at all.
Look at mine.
Now then, enough of that, or there will be a calamity.
- Peter, put some chestnuts on the fire.
- Yes, sir.
Let's tidy the table, girls.
Such a smell.
Sweet enough?
Sweet as honey.
Obviously made by an expert.
And are only experts allowed to taste it?
My dear. Glasses all. Glasses.
Fill mine, Father. Thank you.
- Three, four.
- Thank you.
- Five.
- Thank you.
- Six.
- Thank you.
- Seven.
- Thank you.
Well, this is the largest, but a merry Christmas to us, my dears.
And God bless us all.
And here's to next Christmas, may it bring us luck.
And may Mr. Scrooge give your father a raise.
And a merry Christmas to Mr. Scrooge.
I'll drink to that.
- Delicious.
- How lovely.
And now, Father, a story please.
Yes. Please, a story, Father.
Right you are. A story it is.
Come along, kids. Sit here.
Now let me see.
It seems that once upon a time, there was a little boy...
about your size, Timmy...
- Come, Scrooge, we must go.
- Must we?
Just let me hear Bob's story.
It's about Aladdin and the magic lamp.
Please let me stay.
No, Scrooge.
And he said that Christmas was humbug.
As I live, he did.
As if anything that gave excuse for this could be humbug.
- Your uncle should be ashamed.
- I'm sorry for him.
I couldn't be angry with him if I tried.
After all, he punishes himself.
And how does he do that, pray?
- Well, he has money, hasn't he?
- Yes.
And he makes no use of it, mark you, no use of it whatsoever.
Therefore, he's a far more pathetic and unhappy case... than a man who has no money at all.
QED, he punishes himself.
Now, that's a wonderful idea.
Tom here suggests that we play a game.
Now what shall it be?
- Blindman's buff.
- Blindman's buff? Right.
But first, I want you to drink a toast.
To my uncle Scrooge.
It seems a shame to waste a toast on a man like that.
But, darling, think how happy he makes everyone feel, by contrast.
- To my uncle, Scrooge.
- To Uncle Scrooge.
- Come along now, Tom. You're it.
- Come on, Tom.
You'd best catch us.
Tie it tight.
- Are you sure you can see?
- Perfectly.
That's good.
One, two, three.
Come on, quick.
Quick, he might catch you.
Please, let me stay, just until they finish.
But you don't like Christmas.
It's a time for fools.
I won't go with you. I'm going to stay.
I'm going to stay, I tell you.
Don't be a fool, man.
You don't like Christmas.
But I do. I do like Christmas!
I love Christmas!
You are the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come?
You are about to show me things that have not happened... but will happen in the future.
Is that so, Spirit?
Ghost of the Future,
I know you are here to do me good... and as I hope to be another man from what I was...
I'm ready to accompany you.
Won't you speak?
Lead on.
I shall follow gladly.
No, I don't know much about it either way.
I only know he's dead.
- When did he die?
- Last night, I believe.
- What was the matter with him?
- Who knows? Who cares?
- What has he done with his money?
- I haven't heard.
He hasn't left it to me. That's all I know.
It's likely to be a very cheap funeral.
Upon my life,
I can't think of anybody to go to it.
Suppose we form a party and volunteer.
I don't mind going, if a lunch is provided.
I'll offer to go if anybody else will.
Now I come to think of it,
I'm not sure I wasn't his best friend.
We used to stop and speak whenever we met.
Goodbye.
- How are you?
- How are you?
I know them. I know them both.
Business associates.
So Old Scratch got his own at last?
Yeah, so I've been told. It's cold, isn't it?
Seasonable for Christmas.
- You're not a skater, I suppose.
- No time for it. Business on my mind.
- Well, good morning.
- Good morning.
Is death always like this?
Is it never followed by sorrow and weeping?
It must be getting near your father's time.
Past it, Mommy.
Though he has walked home slower these last few evenings.
I've known him walk with Tiny Tim upon his shoulder very fast indeed.
And so have I, often.
But he was very light to carry, and his father loved him so.
It was no trouble. No trouble.
There's your father at the door.
There you are, my nippers.
Dear.
Here, Father, sit here.
I saw Mr. Scrooge's nephew today.
You did?
Yes, he is a nice fellow.
He saw I looked a trifle down.
Just a trifle, you know.
He asked me what was wrong.
Thank you, dear.
I told him about Tim.
He's such a sweet fellow, somehow I didn't mind telling him.
"I'm heartily sorry for it, Bob," he said.
"And heartily sorry for your good wife."
By the by, how he ever knew that,
I don't know.
Knew what, my dear?
- That you were a good wife.
- Bob.
It really seemed that he knew our Tim and felt with us.
- I'm sure he's a good soul, Bob.
- He is.
And I'm sure that... when we remember how gentle and patient Tim was... we shan't quarrel among ourselves... and in doing it, forget our Tim.
No, Father.
I'm very happy.
I am.
Poor Tim. Poor Tiny Tim.
Everyone who knew him must feel sorrow.
Sorrow they'd never feel for me.
Spirit... tell me the name of the man we saw lying dead.
Tell me!
Answer me this, Spirit.
Are these things you've shown me... are they the shadows of the things that will be, or of the things that may be?
Men's lives lead to certain ends... but if those lives be changed, will not the ends be changed?
Tell me that is true! Tell me!
Then I was the man who lay upon the bed.
No!
Why show me this if I am past all hope?
I shall change my way of living.
I will try to keep Christmas all the year.
I will live in the past, the present, and the future.
The spirit of all three shall be in my heart.
I shall never forget the lessons that they teach.
Tell me that this will change my future.
Tell me that this is not my end.
Please!
Hello!
Hello, there. What's today?
- What's today, my fine fellow?
- Today?
Why, Christmas day.
Do you know the poulterer's at the next street but one, at the corner?
- I should hope I do.
- An intelligent boy.
A remarkable boy.
Do you know whether they've sold the prize turkey that was hanging there?
Not the little prize turkey, the big one.
- It's hanging there now.
- Is it?
- Well, go and buy it.
- What, sir?
I'm in earnest. Yes, I am. Go and buy it.
Come back in less than five minutes, and I'll give you half a crown.
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.
My dear sirs, how do you do?
How do you do?
A merry Christmas to you.
Mr. Scrooge?
Yes, that is my name.
It may not be pleasant to you.
Let me ask your pardon.
And will you have the goodness to take...
Why, bless me, Mr. Scrooge.
Are you in earnest?
If you please. Not a farthing less.
There are a great many back payments... in that amount. Will you do me that favor?
My dear Mr. Scrooge,
I don't know what to say. Such...
Such generosity.
Don't say anything, please, but come and see me. Will you come and see me?
We will, Mr. Scrooge.
Thank you. Bless you.
Hello, my love.
- Would you tell Mr. Fred I wish to see him?
- Yes, sir.
Fred!
- Who is this?
- Your uncle.
Your uncle Scrooge.
Uncle, I didn't know you.
The smile changes me, doesn't it?
But, what are we doing out here?
Come in, Uncle, come in.
This is my uncle. My uncle Scrooge.
How do you do?
Fred, you dog. Who is this fellow?
Not your uncle, I'll be bound.
He'd never have a smile like that.
- He said that...
- That Christmas was a humbug.
- That people who celebrated it were fools.
- Yes, that's what he said.
It was stupid of him.
He won't say it again, mark you.
He won't say it again, ever.
And this is Bess.
May I tell you a secret?
Here, I say. Now what is this?
- No.
- You tell him.
Fred!
Darling!
That's wonderful.
Uncle, thank you so much.
- Merry Christmas, Bob.
- What?
Merry Christmas, Bob!
Here, give this to your wife.
Your good wife.
- Where's Tiny Tim?
- He's out in the back with the others.
Well, get him. Bring him here.
- Bring them all here.
- Yes, sir, I shall.
It's Scrooge. It's Mr. Scrooge.
He's crazy. Quite mad.
Off his top. Lost his buttons.
- Don't be stupid, Bob.
- Look, he gave us this, and more besides.
- Gave it to us?
- Yes.
Then he has gone mad.
Bob, what shall we do?
Our children, Bob. Save them!
Thank heaven, Mr. Fred. You've come for him, of course. Poor fellow.
Did you think he'd gone barmy, too?
No, we haven't come for him.
He told us to wait outside. He said he had some presents he wanted to give you.
- Then he's all right?
- I hope so.
He made me his partner.
We're to be married, Bob.
Isn't that wonderful?
- It is wonderful.
- Yes.
My wife.
My dear.
- Has he gone?
- He's all right.
- Come along, you must meet him.
- No.
- Bob Cratchit.
- Yes, sir?
- Pass out the punch.
- Yes, sir.
I'm going to raise your salary, Bob.
Thank you, sir.
Are you sure?
And when Peter, the scoundrel, when Peter gets a little older... we'll have a job for him, too.
- Won't we, Fred?
- Yes, sir.
- Everything for everybody, Fred?
- Yes.
Here it is, sir.
I'm a little rusty at this.
- I've never done it before, but may I?
- Yes.
Please do.
To all of us, everywhere.
A merry Christmas to us all, my dears.
God bless us, every one.
May I go out now,
Miss Simpson?
Has it stopped snowing?
Not quite.
If it has stopped when your sister returns, perhaps she will take you out.
Oh, dear.
Here, kitty.
Suppose it never stops.
Suppose the man in charge of the snow has forgotten how to stop it.
Don't you think you had better work a while at your sampler?
No, thank you.
Oh, dear.
Hello, Sir Turtle.
You really must stop that,
Your Majesty. Stop it, I say!
Stop what?
The White Queen just knocked over the White King.
She never does look where she's going.
Alice, you know you are not supposed to play with your father's chessmen.
But I wasn't playing.
She deliberately bumped into His
Majesty and knocked him off his feet.
Alice, are you sure that that is true?
Well, I saw it.
Alice.
Yes, Miss Simpson.
At any rate, Your Majesty, stop bumping into your husband.
And you might tidy up a bit.
A white rabbit!
All dressed up in a muffler and overcoat and big woolly shoes.
There. It's gone into its nice warm rabbit hole.
It looked so funny all dressed up.
Alice, I am sure you know that there is no such thing as a rabbit dressed up in a muffler and an overcoat.
You must not say what is not true.
Well, it...
It wasn't untrue exactly.
I think you had better finish your tea.
There is another egg for you to eat.
I did eat both eggs, but I put one of them all back together again.
Alice!
Yes, Miss Simpson.
The looking-glass room.
You see, Dinah, as soon as I hold you up, the little girl in the looking-glass room holds up another cat just like you.
Oh, Dinah, wouldn't you like to see what the looking-glass house is like?
You know, Dinah, there is a looking-glass house.
First, there's the room you can see through the glass.
That's just the same as our sitting room, only the things go the other way.
You'd love living there.
But, of course, I don't know whether looking-glass milk is good to drink.
Well, anyway, then we would come to the hallway.
It is very like our own hallway as far as you can see, only it may be quite different beyond that.
Oh, Dinah,
wouldn't it be nice if we could get through to...
I can see all of the looking-glass room from here, all but a bit.
I would so like to see that little bit just behind the fireplace.
Do you think, Dinah, that if I pressed very, very hard and tried to look straight down, that I might...
Why, why...
Well, I knew this part of the room would be different.
But I do wish the looking-glass chair had moved when I moved ours.
There seems no other way.
If I could only fall like that all the time!
Can't be English.
Of course.
It's the looking-glass room.
Why, it's Uncle and Aunt!
I knew that if you could really get behind a picture,
you'd see the backs of people.
Poor Uncle Gilbert.
His trousers are all patched.
My dear niece, how would you like being framed in one pair of trousers for
20 years without being patched?
It must be very difficult.
It is.
But after all, it's only the front of a picture that counts, really.
Of course.
That is all.
What did you say?
But your hands say
20 minutes to 4:00.
I never let my left hand know what my right hand is doing.
This side of the looking glass has me all confused.
That's because everything is backward on your side.
Why, I...
I never...
Mama! Mama! Mama!
Mama! Mama!
What's that?
It's the voice of my child!
Your child!
Oh, my precious lily!
My imperial kitten!
I must be with my child.
Let me help you.
Mama! Mama!
Dear me.
There, there, my royal pawn.
Poor thing.
Watch out for the volcano.
It blew me up! Be sure you come up the regular way.
Don't get blown up.
You'll be hours and hours getting to the table at that rate.
I'd far better help you.
No, no!
The King's men! Somebody call out the King's men!
I assure you, my dear, I shall never, never forget the horror of this moment.
Well, you will forget, unless you make a memorandum of it.
I shall be very happy to remind you.
We will not be reminded by a volcano.
I'm not a volcano, and
I'm not a cyclone, either.
Then you're either a cyclano or a volcone.
And...
Well, what time was that?
I really haven't any idea, but it's very late.
I must hurry or I shall have to go back through the looking glass
before I've seen what the rest of the house is like.
My, what a strange way to walk about the garden.
The Duchess! The Duchess! Won't she be savage if I've kept her waiting!
Oh, dear! Oh, dear!
I shall be too late!
My ears and whiskers, how late it is getting!
Well, after such a fall as this,
I shall think nothing of tumbling downstairs.
I wish Dinah were here.
That's such pretty music.
Oh, dear.
Ouch.
Goodbye, dear feet.
Oh, will I ever get to the beautiful garden?
Oh!
Oh, Mouse!
Do you know the way out of this pool, oh, Mouse?
I'm very tired of swimming about here.
Perhaps you don't understand English.
I daresay you're a French mouse.
That's French for,
"Where is my cat?"
I beg your pardon. I quite forgot you didn't like cats.
Wait, oh, Mouse!
Oh, Mouse!
Not like cats?
Would you like cats if you were me?
Don't be angry. I wish I could show you our cat Dinah.
You'd take quite a fancy to her.
She's such a dear, quiet thing, and so good at catching mice.
Oh, I beg your pardon.
I hate you!
I hate cats!
My whole family hates cats.
Nasty, low, vulgar things!
Oh, dear!
Wait, oh, Mouse!
Cats! Cats!
Cats!
William the Conqueror, whose cause was favored by the pope, was soon submitted to by the
English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest.
Who are you, please?
I am a dodo.
How do you do?
My name is Alice.
And you are very wet.
I'm afraid I am, but there isn't much I can do about getting dry.
History is the driest thing I know.
Shall we dry you with history?
I'd be much obliged if you could.
Listen well.
Edwin and Morcar, the earls of
Mercia and Northumbria, found it advisable to go with Edgar Aetheling to meet William and offer him the crown.
William's conduct at first was moderate, but the insolence of his Normans...
How are you getting on, my dear?
Beautifully, thank you.
Shall I put you to sleep now?
No, thank you!
Then you'd best run along.
I'm about to recite some dates.
Yes, sir.
Thank you. Goodbye.
1585, Shakespeare was born,
1616, Shakespeare died...
Who are you?
I hardly know, sir, just at present.
At least, I know who I was when I got up this morning, but I must have changed several times since then.
What do you mean by that?
Explain yourself.
I can't explain myself, because I'm not myself, you see.
I don't see!
I can't put it more clearly,
for I can't understand it myself to begin with.
And being so many different sizes in one day is confusing.
It isn't.
Well, when some day you turn into a chrysalis, and after that into a butterfly,
you'll find it a bit queer, won't you?
Not a bit!
Well, maybe you wouldn't, but it would certainly feel very queer to me.
You? Who are you?
I think you ought to tell me who you are first.
Why?
Good day, sir.
Come back. I have something important to say.
Yes?
Keep your temper.
Is that all?
No.
So you think you've changed, do you?
I'm afraid I have, sir.
What size do you want to be?
I should like to be a little larger, sir, if you wouldn't mind.
Three inches is such a horrid height to be.
I am three inches high! It's a very good height to be!
I'm sure it must be, sir, but you see, I'm not used to it.
You'll get used to it in time.
One side will make you grow taller.
The other side will make you grow shorter.
One side of...
Of what?
The mushroom.
Which side will make me grow larger?
The large-making side, of course.
I'll take a little of both to make sure.
Oh, dear, now I'm too big again, oh, Caterpillar.
Mr. Caterpillar, sir, where are you?
Whoever lives here, it would never do to come upon them this size.
Why, I should frighten them out of their wits.
For the Duchess.
An invitation from the Queen to play croquet.
My compliments to the Queen.
My compliments to the Duchess.
There's no sort of use in your knocking.
Please, sir, how am I to get in?
I shall sit here till tomorrow.
I'm sorry you were hit, but how am I to get in?
I shall sit here for days and days.
But what am I to do?
Anything you like.
Please watch out for the baby!
She nearly killed the poor little thing.
If everybody minded their own business, the world would go round much faster than it does.
Speak roughly to your little boy And beat him when he sneezes
He only does it to annoy
Because he knows it teases
Wow! Wow! Wow!
Wow!
Wow!
Wow!
He only does it to annoy
Because he knows it teases
Here, you can nurse it a bit if you like.
Now, I must go and get ready to play croquet with the Queen.
Don't grunt. That's not at all a proper way of expressing yourself.
What am I going to do with this creature when I get it home?
If you're going to turn into a pig, my dear,
I'll have nothing more to do with you. Mind now!
There's no mistake about you now. You're a pig!
You would have grown up to be a dreadfully ugly child, but you do make a handsome pig, I think.
Why do you grin, oh, cat?
Because I'm a Cheshire Cat, that's why.
Well, then,
Cheshire puss, would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?
That depends a good deal on where you want to get to.
I don't care much where.
Then it doesn't matter which way you go.
So long as
I get somewhere.
You're sure to do that, if you only walk long enough.
Do you play croquet with the Queen today?
I should like it very much, but I haven't been invited yet.
You'll see me there.
Must you go so soon?
By the by, what became of the baby?
I'd nearly forgotten to ask.
It turned into a pig.
I thought it would.
Did you say pig or fig?
I said pig
and I wish you wouldn't keep appearing and vanishing so suddenly.
You make one quite giddy.
All right.
Don't you wish you could do this?
Well, I've often seen a cat without a grin, but a grin without a cat?
No room! No room!
No room! No room!
There's plenty of room!
Have some wine?
I don't see any wine.
There isn't any.
It wasn't very civil of you to offer it.
Your hair needs cutting.
You should not make personal remarks. It's very rude.
Why is a raven like a writing desk?
I believe I can answer that.
Do you mean you can find the answer to it?
Exactly so.
You should say what you mean.
What day of the month is it?
Fourth.
Ah! Two days wrong.
I told you that butter wouldn't suit the works.
Oh!
Some crumbs must have got in it as well.
Hmm. I put it in with a bread knife.
It was the best butter, you know.
What a funny watch! It tells the days of the month,
but doesn't tell what "o'clock" it is.
Have you guessed the riddle yet?
Why... Why, no. I give it up.
What is the answer?
I haven't the slightest idea!
Nor I!
I think you might do something better with time than wasting it asking a lot of riddles that have no answers.
Don't you speak about Time. I daresay you've never even spoken to him.
Perhaps not.
Time and I quarreled last March, just before he went mad, you know.
It was at a great concert given by the Queen of Hearts,
and I had to sing, "Twinkle, twinkle, little bat How I wonder what you're at"
You know the song, perhaps?
I've heard something like it.
It goes on, you know, like this.
Twinkle, twinkle, little bat
How I wonder what you're at
Up above the world you fly
Like a tea tray in the sky
Up above the world you fly
Like a tea tray in the sky
Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle...
Twinkle, twinkle, little bat
How I wonder what you're at
Up above the world you fly
Like a tea tray in the sky
Up above the world you fly
Like a tea tray in the sky
Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle
Twinkle, twinkle...
Well, I'd hardly finished the first verse when the Queen bawled,
"He's murdering the Time!
Off with his head!"
And ever since that, he won't do a thing I ask.
It's always 6:00 now.
Is that why all the tea things are out here?
Yes, that's it.
It's always teatime, and we have no time to wash the tea things in between.
Take some more tea.
I haven't had any yet, so I can't take more.
You mean you can't take less. It is very easy to take more than nothing.
I want a clean cup.
It's the stupidest tea party
I ever was at in all my life!
Very curious!
Would you please tell me why are you painting those roses?
I...
Well, as a matter of fact, Miss, this tree should have been a red rose tree and we put in a white one by mistake, and if the Queen should find out,
we'll all have our heads cut off.
So, you see, Miss, we're doing our best before she comes back to paint...
The Queen!
The Queen!
The Queen!
Come, come, get up!
Her Majesty, the Queen of Hearts.
Her Majesty, the Queen!
Off with his head!
Off with his head!
What is your name, child?
My name is Alice, so please Your Majesty.
Off with her head!
Off with her head!
Nonsense!
Off with her head!
Off with her head!
Consider, my dear.
She's only a child.
Off with her head!
Off with her head!
And besides, this is the executioners' day off.
It is, is it? Well, they shall lose their heads for this!
Can you play croquet?
Yes.
Then let the game begin at once.
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!
Must I behead you all?
Here, take it. Play.
Off with some heads.
You're pointing the wrong way for a mallet!
Pardon me. My back hurts.
Well!
Don't look at me.
I'm as mixed up as you are!
This game's slowing up.
Off with some heads!
Where are my victims?
Search the hedges.
Thrash the bushes.
Shake the trees!
How glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing.
How did you like your game?
Well, it was very exciting.
Of course it is.
And the moral of that is,
"Be what you would like to be."
Or, to put it more simply, "Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise
"than what it might appear to others that what you were or might have been
"wasn't otherwise than what you had been
"would have appeared to them to be otherwise."
I should understand that better if it were written down.
I can't quite follow it as you say it.
That's nothing to what
I could say, if I chose.
And the moral of that is...
It's a fine day,
Your Majesty.
I give you fair warning. Either you or your head must be off at once!
Please, Your Majesty, could you make it go away?
Queen! Queen!
Where are you, Queen?
What fun!
What is the fun?
The Queen.
They never really execute anybody she condemns, you know.
The King...
The King pardons everybody.
I'm very happy to know that, I'm sure.
Have you seen the Mock Turtle yet?
Why... Why, no. I don't even know what a Mock Turtle is.
It's what mock turtle soup's made from.
Come here, will you,
Mock Turtle, old thing?
What is his sorrow?
It's all his fancy.
He hasn't got no sorrow.
No sorrow, indeed.
Mine are the sorrows of a sorrowful sorrow.
Mine are the woes of a woeful woe.
Mine are the...
This here young lady, she wants for to know your history, she do.
I'll tell it her.
Sit down, both of you, and don't speak a word till I've finished.
Once I was a real turtle.
Oh, dear!
Oh, dear!
When we were little, we went to school in the sea.
The master was an old turtle.
We used to call him Tortoise.
Why did you call him
Tortoise if he wasn't one?
We called him Tortoise because he taught us.
You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question.
We went to school in the sea, though you mayn't believe it.
I never said I didn't. You did.
Hold your tongue!
We had the best of educations.
In fact, we went to school every day.
I've been to a day school, too.
We learned
French and music.
I only took the regular course.
What was that?
Reeling and writhing to begin with.
And then the different branches of arithmetic, ambition, distraction, uglification and derision.
And how many hours a day did you do lessons?
Ten hours the first day and nine the next and so on.
That's why they're called lessons, because they lessen from day to day.
Then the 11th day must have been a holiday.
Of course.
And how did you manage on the 12th day?
Well, that's enough about lessons.
Shall we play games, or shall the Mock Turtle sing?
Oh, a song, please, if the
Mock Turtle would be so kind.
No accounting for tastes.
Sing her Turtle Soup, will you, old fellow?
In a moment.
Beautiful soup
Who cares for fish
Game, or any other dish?
Who would not give all else for two
Pennyworth only of beautiful soup?
Pennyworth only of beautiful soup
Beautiful soup, beautiful soup
Soup of the evening
Beautiful soup, beautiful...
Faster! Faster!
Faster! Faster!
Faster! Much faster!
Are we nearly there?
Nearly there?
Why, we passed it
10 minutes ago. Faster!
It's all marked out like a chessboard.
Of course it's a chessboard,
and life is a chessboard, and you are a Queen's pawn.
You will go immediately to the fourth square, which you should reach in exactly no time.
Did you remark something?
I didn't know I had to make one just then.
You should have told me how kind it is of me to tell you all this.
No questions? Very well, then, no answers.
Open your mouth wide when you speak, and always speak in French
if you can't think of the English for something.
Turn out your toes as you walk
and always say "Your
Majesty," and so forth.
If you think we're waxworks, you ought to pay, you know.
Waxworks weren't made to be looked at for nothing, nohow.
Contrary-wise, if you think we're alive, you ought to speak.
I'm sure I'm very sorry.
I was wondering which is the best way out of this wood.
Would you tell me, please?
You've begun wrong.
The first thing in a visit is to say,
"How do you do?"
And shake hands.
I hope you're not much tired.
Why, nohow, but thank you very much for asking.
So much obliged.
You like poetry?
Yes, pretty well.
Some poetry.
But would you tell me first which road leads out of the woods?
What shall I repeat to her?
The Walrus and the
Carpenter is the longest.
"The sun was shining on the sea Shining with all his might
"He did his very best to make
The billows smooth and bright
"And this was odd because it was The middle of the night
"The Walrus and the Carpenter
Were walking close at hand
"They wept like anything to see Such quantities of sand
"'lf this were only cleared away'
They said, 'it would be grand'
"'lf seven maids with seven mops Swept it for half a year
"'Do you suppose,' the Walrus said
"'That they could get it clear?"'
"'I doubt it,' said the
Carpenter And shed a bitter tear"
"'Oh, oyster, come and walk with us, ' The Walrus did beseech
"'A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk Along the briny beach'
"They could not do with more than four To give a hand to each
"The eldest oyster looked at him But never a word he said
"The eldest oyster winked his eye And shook his heavy head
"Meaning to say he did not choose To leave the oyster bed
"But younger oysters hurried up All eager for the treat
"Their coats were brushed
Their faces washed
"Their shoes were clean and neat
"And this was odd because, you know They hadn't any feet
"'The time has come,' the Walrus said 'To talk of many things
"'Of shoes and ships and sealing wax Of cabbages and kings"
"'And why the sea is boiling hot And whether pigs have wings"'
"'A loaf of bread,' the Walrus said 'ls what we chiefly need
"'Pepper and vinegar besides
Are very good indeed
"'Now, if you're ready, oysters dear We can begin to feed'
"'But not on us, ' the oysters cried Turning a little blue
"'After such kindness that would be A dismal thing to do!'
"'The night is fine,' the Walrus said 'Do you admire the view?'
"'I weep for you,' the Walrus said 'I deeply sympathize'
"With sobs and tears he sorted out Those of the largest size
"Holding his pocket handkerchief
Before his streaming eyes
"'Oh, oyster,' said the Carpenter
'You've had a pleasant run
"'Shall we be trotting home again?' But answer came there none
"And this was scarcely odd because They'd eaten every one"
Well, they were both very unpleasant characters.
But at any rate, I'd better be leaving the wood
because it's really getting very dark. Well, goodbye.
Look!
Do you see that?
It's only a rattle.
Only an old rattle, quite old and broken.
I knew it was.
It's spoiled, of course.
My nice new rattle.
Of course, you agree to have a battle?
I suppose so.
Only she must help us to dress up, you know.
Of course!
"Tweedledee and Tweedledum
Agreed to have a battle
"For Tweedledee said Tweedledum
"Had spoiled his nice new rattle
"Just then down flew a monstrous crow As black as a tar barrel
"Which frightened both the heroes so
"They quite forgot their quarrel"
I hope you're good at pinning and tying string.
All this has got to go on somehow or other.
This is to keep my head from being cut off.
You know, one of the most serious things that can happen to one in a battle
is to get one's head cut off.
Do I look very pale?
Well, yes, a little.
I'm very brave generally, only today I happen to have a headache.
Well, I've got a toothache.
I'm far worse than you.
Then you'd both better not fight today.
We must have a bit of a fight.
Let's fight till 6:00 and then have dinner.
There's only one sword, but you can have the umbrella. It's sharper.
Only we must begin quick.
It's getting very, very dark.
And darker and darker.
What a thick black cloud that is, and how fast it comes!
Why, I do believe it's got wings.
It's the crow!
The crow!
May I put your shawl straight for you?
I don't know what's the matter with it.
It's out of temper, I think.
I've pinned it here and I've pinned it there, but there's no pleasing it.
It can't go on straight, you know, if you put all the pins on one side.
And dear me, what a state your hair is in!
Oh, the brush has got entangled in it.
And I lost the comb yesterday.
There, now you look better.
My finger's bleeding.
What's the matter?
Have you pricked your finger?
I haven't pricked it yet, but I soon shall.
When do you expect to do it?
When I fasten my shawl again, the broach will come undone.
Watch out, you're holding it all wrong.
Now you understand the way things happen here.
But why don't you scream now?
Why, I've done all the screaming already.
Now, what would be the good of doing it all over again?
I suppose so.
Well, it's a bit lighter now.
I'm glad that crow is gone.
I hope your finger's better now.
Much better. Better, better, better.
What is it you want to buy?
I should like to buy an egg, please.
I never put things into people's hands.
That would never do.
You must get it for yourself.
What a strange egg!
It keeps growing much faster than it should! Curiouser and curiouser!
It's bigger than a chicken!
Why, it's...
It's Humpty-Dumpty!
Don't stand there staring at me as if I were an egg.
Tell me your name and your business.
My name is Alice.
It's a stupid enough name.
What does it mean?
Must a name mean something?
Of course it must.
My name means the shape I am, and a right handsome shape it is.
With your name, you might be any shape.
Why do you sit out here all alone?
Because there's nobody with me.
Did you think
I couldn't answer that?
Ask another.
Don't you think you'd be safer on the ground?
That wall is so very narrow.
Of course I don't think so.
Why, if I ever did fall off,
which there's no chance of, but if I did...
If I did fall, the King has promised me...
To send all his horses and all his men.
Ah, so, you know. All his horses and all his men.
They'd pick me up again in a minute, they would.
However, this conversation is going on a little too fast.
Let's go back to the last remark but one.
I'm afraid I can't quite remember it.
In that case, we start afresh,
and it's my turn to choose a subject.
How old did you say you were?
Twelve years and four months.
Wrong. You never said a word like it.
I thought you meant,
"How old are you?"
If I'd meant that,
I'd have said that.
Twelve years and four months.
An uncomfortable sort of age.
Now, my advice would have been to leave off at 12, but it's too late now.
What a beautiful belt!
Or is it a beautiful collar?
It is a most provoking thing when a person doesn't know a collar from a belt.
I know it's very ignorant of me.
It's a collar, child, and a beautiful one, as you say.
It's a present from the White King and Queen.
Is it really?
They gave it to me for an un-birthday present.
I beg your pardon?
I am not offended, and it isn't respectable to beg.
I mean, what is an un-birthday present?
A present given when it isn't your birthday, of course.
I like birthday presents best.
You don't know what you're talking about.
How many days are there in a year?
Three hundred and sixty-five.
And how many birthdays have you?
One.
And if you take that from 365, what remains?
Three hundred and sixty-four, of course.
Well then, there are 364 days when you might get un-birthday presents.
Certainly.
And only one for birthday presents.
That's glory for you!
I don't know what you mean by glory.
Of course you don't, till I tell you.
I meant there's a nice knock-down argument for you.
But glory doesn't mean that.
When I use a word, it means what I choose it to mean, neither more or less.
The question is whether you can make words mean different things.
The question is, which is to be the master, you or the word? That's all.
However, I can manage the whole lot.
Impenetrability, that's what I say.
Would you tell me, please, what that means?
I meant by impenetrability that we've had enough of the subject, and it would be just as well if you would mention what you mean to do next,
as I suppose you don't mean to stop here all the rest of your life.
Fancy it meaning all that.
You seem very clever at explaining words, sir.
Would you kindly tell me the meaning of a poem called Jabberwocky?
I read it a long time ago.
I can, but I won't.
That's all. Goodbye.
Goodbye, till we meet again.
I shouldn't know you if we did meet.
You're so exactly like other people.
The face is what one generally goes by.
That's just it. Your face is the same as everybody's.
The two eyes, so.
Nose in the middle, mouth under.
Now, if your two eyes were on the same side of your nose, or your mouth on the top, that would be some help.
It wouldn't look nice.
Wait till you've tried.
Watch out!
Help! Help! I'm falling!
Tell the King!
Tell him to bring his horses and his men!
Help!
What happened?
We ran into each other,
Your Majesty.
Good. I rather fancied something like that had happened.
Oh, Your Majesty,
Humpty-Dumpty fell off the wall!
I know, I know.
Four-thousand, two-hundred and seven of my soldiers are on the way.
Two without horses.
If all this King's horses and men
can't put him back together again, nobody can.
I'm glad Humpty will be all right. I was worried.
Well, don't be.
Look along the road and tell me if you can see either of my three messengers.
I see nobody on the road.
Oh, I only wish
I had such eyes!
To be able to see nobody, and at that distance!
Oh!
It's too, too bad!
Can I help you, sir?
On or off?
You are on.
In a short time
I shall be off again.
I'm so sorry. Are you the King's messenger?
I am the White Knight.
I see you're admiring my little box.
It's my own invention, to keep clothes and sandwiches in.
You see, I carry it upside down so the rain can't come in.
But the things can get out.
Do you know the lid is open?
Then if all the things have fallen out, the box is no use without them.
Can you guess why I did that?
I can't imagine.
In hopes some bees may make a nest in it. Then I should get the honey.
But you've got a beehive, or something like one, fastened to the saddle.
It's a very good beehive, too.
One of the best kind, but not a single bee has come near it yet.
That other thing's a mousetrap.
I suppose the mice keep the bees out
or the bees keep the mice out. I don't know which.
It isn't very likely there would be any mice on a horse's back.
Not very likely, perhaps,
but I don't choose to have them running all about.
You see, I'm well provided for everything.
That's the reason the horse has those anklets around his feet.
What are they for?
To guard against the bites of sharks. It's my own invention.
But let's go on. I'll go with you to the edge of the wood.
I hope you've got your hair well-fastened on.
Only the usual way.
That's hardly enough. You see, the wind is so strong here.
It's strong as soup.
Have you invented a plan for keeping the hair from being blown off?
Not yet, but I have a plan for keeping the hair from falling off.
I should like to hear it very much.
First, you take an upright stick, then you make your hair creep up it like a vine.
Now, the reason hair falls off is because it hangs down.
Things never fall upward, you know. It's my own invention.
You may try it if you like.
I'm a great hand at inventing things.
Now, I daresay you noticed the last time you picked me up,
I was looking rather thoughtful.
You were a little grave.
Well, just then I was inventing a new way of getting over a gate.
Would you like to hear it?
Very much, indeed.
Well, I'll tell you how I came to think of it. I said to myself,
"The only difficulty is with the feet.
"The head's high enough already."
Now, first I put my head on top of the gate, then my head's high enough, then I stand on my head, then my feet are high enough.
Then I'm over.
Sir Knight!
If there were only a gate down here,
I'd be in excellent position to cross it.
How can you go on talking so quietly with your head in a ditch?
What does it matter where my body happens to be?
My mind goes on working all the same.
In fact, I once invented a new pudding during the meat course.
In time to have it cooked for the next course? Hmm.
That was quick work.
Well, not the next course.
In fact, I don't believe that pudding ever was cooked.
What did you mean it to be made of?
Well, it began with blotting paper.
That wouldn't be very nice, I'm afraid.
Not very nice alone, but imagine how good it would be mixed with other things, such as gunpowder and sealing wax.
And here I must leave you.
This is the end of the wood.
You've only a few yards to go.
Down the hill, across that little brook, and then you'll be a queen.
At last!
But you'll stay and see me off first?
I shan't be long.
You'll wait?
Of course I'll wait.
I think it'll encourage me.
Thank you very much for coming so far out of your way.
For that, I shall expect you to cry a good deal as I go.
The poor, dear Knight.
He's the nicest person yet.
Well, here I am.
What's this?
A crown! A golden crown!
I'm a queen!
I'm a queen!
How dare you say that you're a queen.
What right have you to call yourself so?
You can't be a queen, you know,
till you've passed the proper examination, and the sooner we begin it, the better. Be seated.
Yes, Your Majesty.
I'm ready, Your Majesties.
Can you do addition?
Now what's one and one and one and one and one and one, one and one?
I don't know.
I lost count.
She can't do addition.
Can you answer any useful questions? How is bread made?
I know that.
You take some flour...
Where do you pick the flower, in a garden or in the hedges?
It isn't picked at all, it's ground.
But how many acres of ground?
I wish you wouldn't leave out so many things!
Oh, dear.
You know any languages?
What's the French for "fiddle-de-dee"?
Fiddle-de-dee's not English.
Whoever said it was?
Well, if you'll tell me what language fiddle-de-dee is,
I'll tell you the French for it.
Queens never make bargains!
I'm so sleepy.
She's tired, poor thing.
So, smooth her hair, lend her your nightcap and sing her a soothing lullaby.
I haven't any nightcap, and I don't know any soothing lullabies.
I'll have to do it myself.
Hush-a-bye lady in Alice's lap
When the feast's ready we've time for a nap
When the feast's over we'll go to the ball
Red Queen and White Queen and Alice and all
Now that you know the words, sing it through to me. I'm sleepy, too.
Now what am I to do?
Do wake up.
To the looking-glass world
It was Alice that said
"I've a scepter in hand
"I've a crown on my head"
No admittance until week after next.
Why... Why, how dare you!
Fill up the glasses as quick as you can
And sprinkle the table
With buttons and bran
Put cats in the coffee and mice in the tea
And welcome Queen Alice with 30 times three
Put cats in the coffee and mice in the tea
And welcome Queen Alice
With 30 times three
Then put in the glasses, molasses and ink
And anything else that is pleasant to drink
Mix sand with the cider
And wool with the wine
And welcome Queen Alice
With 90 times nine
Mix sand with the cider
And wool with the wine
And welcome Queen Alice
With 90 times 90 times
90 times nine
You've missed the soup and fish! Serve the roast!
You seem a little shy. Let me introduce you to that leg of mutton.
Alice, Leg of Mutton.
Leg of Mutton, Alice.
How do you do?
May I give you a slice?
Certainly not!
It isn't etiquette to cut somebody you've been introduced to.
Remove the roast!
Will you, won't you, will you, won't you...
Please don't introduce the Pudding, or we shall get no dinner at all.
May I give you some?
Pudding, Alice.
Alice, Pudding.
What impertinence!
How would you like it if I were to cut a slice out of you, you creature?
Make a remark.
It's ridiculous to leave all the conversation to the Pudding.
Well...
You'd better prepare.
We're about to drink to your health. Queen Alice's health!
Queen Alice's health!
Queen Alice!
Queen Alice!
She ought to make a speech. A speech!
So she ought!
A speech! A speech!
A speech!
A speech!
Speech!
Speech!
I rise to return thanks.
Take care! Something's going to happen! Something's going to happen!
Here I am!
There was a looking-glass room, and you were the Red Queen.
There was a whole looking-glass country.
-So you're going to Washington?
-Yes, ma'am.
My son is sick in a hospital there.
This will be an anxious Christmas for you. l think this one will do. Let's try this.
-ls it your only son?
-No, ma'am. l had four, but two were killed and one is a prisoner.
You've done a great deal for your country, sir.
Not a mite more than l ought, ma'am. l'd go myself if l was any use.
Thank you for the overcoat.
Wait a minute. l hope you find him better.
Thank you, ma'am. God bless you.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
Mrs. March, will you sign this so l can get it off?
Why, what's the matter?
When l see things like that poor old man...
...it makes me ashamed to think how little l do.
But, my dear, you're doing all you can here, and your husband is there.
Yes, l know.
His last son is lying ill, miles away...
...waiting to say goodbye to him, forever perhaps...
...while l have my four girls to comfort me.
And a real comfort they are, too, aren't they? l couldn't bear it without them.
-Meg and Jo are working, you know?
-Yes?
Meg is a nursery governess.
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
Remember, Lily,
Santa Claus is watching you.
Come on, Tony.
''We know as well, what are the baneful fruits of selfishness...
''...and self-indulgence.
Bad habits take root with fearful rapidity...
''...even in the richest natures.
''They grow...
''...and ripen and bear their fruit...
''...like southern vines and weeds...
''...almost...
''...in a single day and night.
''Crush them, pluck them out pitilessly from their very first appearance...
''...and do not weary...
''...of the labor of plucking them out...
''...again and again.''
Goodbye, goodbye!
Hold your tongue, you disrespectful old bird!
Go on, Josephine.
Josephine!
Where are you off to, Miss? l didn't think you'd mind. lt was nearly time to leave and the girls said they'd be home early...
...so we could rehearse my play for Christmas.
Never a thought about my Christmas.
Flying off without a word of cheer or greeting for your poor old aunt. l'm sorry, Aunt March.
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.
Here. lt's a dollar for each. Well, take them.
Thank you, Aunty.
Never mind thanking me.
Just spend it wisely, that's all l ask.
Although it's more than l can expect when you're so much like your father...
...waltzing off to war and letting other folks look after his family.
There's nobody looking after us.
And we don't ask favors from anybody. l'm very proud of Father and you should be, too.
-Don't you be impertinent, Miss.
-l'm sorry, Aunty. lt isn't preachers that are going to win this war. lt's fighters!
Yes, Aunty.
-Can l go, now?
-Yeah, go on.
-Did you clean Polly's cage today?
-Yes, Aunty.
Did you wash those teacups and put them away carefully?
Yes, Aunty.
-You didn't break any?
-No, Aunty.
-What about the teaspoons?
-l polished them.
Yes. Very well then.
Wait, just a minute. Come back here.
Look at this. You haven't dusted properly. l want this stair rail dusted and polished before you leave here.
Yes, Aunty.
Higher.
Thank you very much, ladies.
And now l wish you all a very merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas!
School is dismissed.
Amy March! You may close the door.
That'll teach her not to cut up didoes.
-lt serves that stuck-up Amy March right.
-What's he going to do to her? l can see there's nothing for me to do but to stop by and show your mother...
...how instead of doing your sums, you cover your slate with sketches.
And most uncomplimentary sketches.
Please, Mr. Davis, l'll never do it again, sir.
And she'd be so disappointed in me.
Please.
Please.
Well, l should hate to spoil her Christmas...
...and for that reason alone, young lady, l shall overlook it.
Thank you, Mr. Davis!
You may go.
Thank you, Mr. Davis.
Thank you very much indeed.
Thank you, sir.
Here she is.
-What did he do?
-What did he say?
Come on, tell us. What happened? l just said that if l ever told my mother the way he treated me...
...she'd take me out of his old school.
She's never been ''reconciliated'' anyway...
...since my father lost his money and she's had to suffer the ''degaridation''...
...of me being thrown in with a lot of ill-mannered girls...
...who stick their noses in refined people's business.
Little tiny pussy, l'll tell you a long story.
-Hannah, is it teatime?
-Yes.
-l'll set the table.
-Thank you, Beth. lt'll be a help to me
'cause my bread's raised.
The girls are getting home early.
-Are they coming?
-Just passing the Laurence house.
-Christopher Columbus!
-Jo, don't use such dreadful expressions.
Here comes old Mr. Laurence.
What if he heard you? l don't care. l like good strong words that mean something.
Oh, bother.
Now we're going to have to speak to him.
How do? lt makes my knees chatter just to look at him. l feel sorry for that poor boy, shut up alone with such an ogre for a grandfather.
-Look, there he is.
-Where?
Don't point, Jo.
He'll think you're waving at him.
He's gone anyway. Well, what if he does?
Jo! Come along, Amy.
-How's my Beth?
-lt's cold outside!
Jo just did the most terrible thing.
Beth, come over here.
-He waved at us.
-ls tea ready yet?
Merry Christmas from Aunt March.
-For me?
-Yes, darling, for you.
We got one, too.
-What are you going to do with it, dear?
-l don't know.
Marmee said we ought not to spend money for pleasure...
...when our men are suffering so in the Army.
A dollar couldn't do the Army much good, so l'm going to buy Undine and Sintram. l've wanted it long enough. l'm sure Marmee would approve if l got some new gloves. l've darned my old ones until l can hardly get them on.
She always says a real lady is known by her neat gloves and boots. l shall get a nice box of Faber's drawing pencils. l really need them.
Then l'd like to spend mine for some new music...
...that is, if you don't think Marmee would mind.
Let's each buy what we want and have a little fun. l'm sure we work hard enough. l know l do. lt's not the work l mind so much. lt's having to tell Flo King how pretty she looks...
...in things l know would look as well on me.
What would you do if you were shut up all day with an old crosspatch...
...who flies off the handle every move you make?
Jo, don't use slang.
Besides, don't forget she gave us the dollar. l'm sure neither of you suffer as l do.
You don't have to go to that nasty old Davis' school...
...with impertinent girls who laugh at you and ''label'' your father 'cause he isn't rich.
''Libel.'' Don't say ''label'' as if Papa were a pickle bottle. l know what l mean and you needn't be ''statirical'' about it. lt's proper to use good words and improve your ''vocabilary.''
Aren't we elegant?
You'd never be thought so with your slang. l hope not. l don't want to be elegant.
-You needn't whistle like a boy.
-That's why l do it.
-l detest rude, unladylike girls.
-And l hate affected, niminy-piminy chicks.
Birds in their little nests agree.
Really, you're both to blame.
You're old enough to leave off boyish tricks and behave better, Josephine.
Now you are so tall and turn up your hair, you must remember you're a young lady.
No, l'm not. And if turning up my hair makes me so, l'll wear it down till l'm 100.
Jo!
As for you, Amy, your absurd words are as bad as Jo's slang.
Your airs are funny now, but you'll grow into an affected goose...
...unless you take care. lf Jo is a tomboy and Amy's a goose, what am l, please?
You're a dear and nothing else.
We're three ungrateful wretches who don't deserve you.
Wait until l become a famous author and make my fortune.
Then we'll all ride in fine carriages, dressed like Flo King...
...snubbing Amy's friends and telling
Aunt March to go to the dickens.
Let's rehearse.
We'll start with the fainting scene.
You're as stiff as a poker in that, Amy.
Well, l can't help it. l've never seen anyone faint...
...and l don't intend to make myself black-and-blue tumbling as flat as you do. lt's easy if you'll only watch me. Come on.
-lf l can drop gracefully, l'll....
-Now, when l come in...
...you'll see the horrible look in my eyes and you shrink back trembling.
Go ahead.
Get into the mood, Amy.
Now, when l start toward you, with wicked intentions....
Oh, Amy, you...
...draw back in horror, covering your eyes with your hands.
''Roderigo, Roderigo!
''Save me, save me! ''
There, now you see? Now, it's easy.
Now, here l come.
''Roderigo, Roderigo!
''Save me, save me! ''
-You were marvelous.
-That was lovely.
Glad to find you so merry, my girls.
-Darling.
-Marmee.
-How is your cold, Meg?
-Much better.
Beth, dear, kiss me, baby.
Thank you, Jo. Thank you, dear.
-You look tired to death, Jo.
-No, Marmee, l'm not tired.
-Your slippers are all ready now.
-That's my Bethie, dearie.
Did you have a hard day, Marmee?
No, very pleasant, dear.
But it's good to be home.
-l have a treat for you.
-A letter from Father?
Three cheers for Father.
''Give them all my dear love and a kiss.
''Tell them l know they will remember all l said to them:
''That they will be loving children to you...
''...they will do their duty faithfully, fight their bosom enemies bravely...
''...and conquer themselves so beautifully...
''...that when l come back to them, l may be fonder and prouder than ever...
''...of my little women.'' l am a selfish girl...
...but l'll truly try to be better and not waste my time in school...
...so that Father may not be disappointed in me. l'll try and be what he loves to call me,
''a little woman''...
...and not be rough and wild, and do my duty here at home...
...instead of always wanting to go to war to help Father. l'm not going to be envious anymore, if l can help it.
Now, we'll save the rest till after tea...
...for it's such a lovely long letter. l know everybody must be hungry.
Let's get something for Marmee with our dollar...
...instead of for ourselves, shall we?
That's like you, Beth. What shall we get?
-l'll get her a nice pair of gloves.
-New slippers, best to be had.
Some handkerchiefs, all hemmed.
A beautiful little bottle of cologne.
She'll like that, and it won't cost much...
...and then l'll have some left over for my pencils. l've finished with Asia.
And here is Europe.
-Three stitches and you can have Africa.
-Not too long stitches, dear. lf you pass me the scissors, l'll give you America.
There, you see? You did finish it after all.
You wanted to put it off until tomorrow.
But we never should have if Jo hadn't made a game of it...
...and thought of talking of the different countries as we worked. lt was a nice idea, Jo.
Do you remember how you used to play
Pilgrim 's Progress when you were little? l can see us all now with your ragbags tied over our backs for burdens.
You have real burdens now, instead of ragbags.
According to what l heard before tea, except Beth.
She didn't say. Maybe she hasn't any.
Yes, l have.
Mine is dishes and dusters and being afraid of people...
...and envying girls with nice pianos.
A piano is a burden.
Good night, my precious.
Good night, Marmee.
-Good night, Jo, my girl.
-Good night, Marmee.
-Good night, darling.
-Good night, my baby.
-Good night, Marmee.
-Good night, Bethie.
-Merry Christmas, Hannah.
-Merry Christmas!
Where's Marmee?
She just went down the street, but she'll be right back.
She wants you to have your breakfast when l can get it dished up.
Come round here.
Hide them. Get close.
-Where have you been, Amy?
-What have you been doing?
Don't laugh, Jo. l only changed the little bottle of cologne...
...for a big one. l gave all my money to get it.
-Amy.
-Darling.
That was unselfish of you.
You're some pumpkins, Amy. l felt ashamed, thinking only of myself.
Amy, my prettiest rose.
And l'm so glad, because mine is the handsomest now.
-Where is Marmee?
-She'll be back any minute. Breakfast!
-Hannah, l'm so hungry.
-Hannah, what is it?
Sausages!
Popovers!
They are my favorites!
Coffee!
Oh, Hannah, you've beat the Dutch.
No need to make such a fuss about it. l remember when l used to serve it on your father's table every day.
No?
-Hannah, were we really that rich?
-How was l dressed? l'd like to tell Jenny Snow all the pretty clothes l used to wear.
-l can tell her. Diapers!
-Jo!
Two each.
-lsn't this marvelous?
-Look at all the popovers.
She's coming!
Hurry, Beth, strike up.
Amy, open the door.
Come here, Meg. We'll cover these up and it'll be a surprise.
Enter, Marmee.
-Merry Christmas, Marmee!
-Merry Christmas, my....
Oh, darling!
Oh, Meg, dear! Thank you!
And handkerchiefs from Bethie. Thank you.
Hannah, did you see?
Amy, my precious, thank you!
These are from me.
Jo, my girl.
Thank you, darlings. Thank you.
Oh, my girls. l can't tell you how happy l am.
Well, l can tell you how hungry l am.
Come on, everyone. Pass me those plates.
-Sit down, Marmee.
-Marmee, look! Sausages.
Wait a minute, girls. l want to say one word before we begin. l've just come from a poor woman with a little newborn baby...
...and six children huddled into one bed to keep from freezing, for they have no fire.
They are suffering cold and hunger.
My girls, will you give them your breakfast as a Christmas present? l'm so glad you came back before we started. l knew you would.
May l carry some things?
We shall all go. Take the coffee, Hannah.
-l'll get some firewood.
-l'll take the cream. l'll take the bread. l'll take the popovers.
Here we are, Mrs. Hummel.
Gott in Himmel. Good angels come to us.
Funny angels, in hoods and mittens.
Do you want some bread to eat?
Here, l'll give you some bread.
Strange that Roderigo is not here.
His note says ''promptly on the hour.''
''And why....''
And why Black Hugo's castle for the tryst? l am afraid.
Who comes here?
Your Highness, 'tis Mona the hag.
Black Hugo hath betrayed thee. l must fly.
Zara will be waiting.
My proud beauty!
She will be mine!
Black Hugo approaches.
Withered crone, begone!
Roderigo, Roderigo!
Save me, save me!
And now to carry out my fell design.
What a fake.
Well, l told you l wasn't going to make myself--
Have pity. Oh, have pity!
Bring not upon me the worst of shame!
Silence, else you'll rue the day you spurned Black Hugo's love.
Make thyself ready for the wedding. l shall return within the quarter.
Ah, me!
Heaven protect the helpless!
Zara ! My beloved!
Roderigo, durst l believe my eyes?
''The pale stars are twinkling
''The fair moon is rising above
''My guitar is tinkling
''But the notes are not sweet
Till they bring me my love''
Courage, my fair.
The good padre waits at yonder gate with the horses.
See, the ladder. All is arranged.
Liberty! Fly with me.
Fly with me, my love. l will assist you. l will.... lt's all right, everyone.
Stay where you are.
Young ladies.
Will you all please come in to supper?
Christopher Columbus! What's this? ls it fairies?
-lt's Santa Claus?
-Mother did it?
-Aunt March had a good fit and sent it?
-All wrong. Mr. Laurence sent it.
-No!
-Who is Mr. Laurence?
The Laurence boy's grandfather.
He lives next door.
He heard what you did about your breakfast...
...and sent me a nice note...
...saying he hoped l'd allow him to express his friendly feeling toward my children...
...and send them a few trifles in honor of the day.
The boy put it into his head, l know he did.
He looks like a capital fellow and l'm dying to get acquainted. l'm going to, too. l wish Father were here. l'm afraid he isn't having such a merry Christmas as we are.
Hello.
How do you do? l wanted to thank you.
We did have such a good time over your nice Christmas present.
What's the matter? Are you sick?
Just a little cold, but grandfather's made me stop indoors for a week.
That's too bad.
Can anybody come to see you? lf they would.
Wait, l'll ask Marmee.
Close the window now.
-How do you do, Miss March?
-How do you do, Mr. Laurence?
Mother was so sorry to hear that you'd been ill.
My sister, Meg, sent you some of her blancmange. lt's soft and will slide down easily without hurting your throat.
Thank you.
And Beth lent you these until you're well. l know boys don't like kittens, but she was so anxious l couldn't refuse.
Maybe they'll help to liven things up. lt's as dull as tombs over here.
Won't you come in?
No, l'm not to stay.
Please. Just for a few minutes. l've ordered tea.
Christopher Columbus!
What richness! lt's just like summer!
This is marvelous! lt's so roomy.
How many, please?
Two, please. Three.
How do you like it here after living in Europe so long, Mr. Laurence? l'm going to Europe.
-Really? When?
-l don't know.
My aunt has rheumatism and the doctor thought the baths....
Not that she hasn't a bath.
She has a very nice one.
Did you take any baths while you were there?
-l mean, for rheumatism.
-No, l'm not troubled with rheumatism.
Neither am l. But she thought that baths wouldn't do me any harm. l mean, that is to say, while l was there.
You see, l've always wanted to go to Europe.
Not for the baths, of course, but for my writing.
You see, my aunt....
But you don't know Aunt March, do you?
Well, never mind.
What were you saying, Mr. Laurence? l'm not Mr. Laurence. l'm only Laurie.
Laurie.
How do you like it here after Europe? lt's strange after living in schools all my life...
...but it will be all right when l get used to Grandfather.
You know, he....
Yes, you should have seen him before you came.
-lsn't he a holy terror?
-You ought to see Aunt March. lt's too pretty to eat. l wish we had things like this over here.
And l wish.... lt is nice, isn't it?
My little sister put on the geranium leaves.
She's very artistic.
-Amy?
-Yes. How do you know? l often hear you calling to one another...
...and when l'm alone over here.... l beg your pardon for being so rude...
...but sometimes you forget to put down the curtains...
...and when the lamps are lighted, it's like looking at a picture...
...to see you all around the table with your mother.
You always seem to be having such good times.
We'll never draw that curtain anymore.
And l give you leave to look as much as you like. l wish instead of just peeping, you'd come over and see us.
We'd have jolly times together.
Would you let me be in a play? l saw some of it the other night.
That was terrible. l want to put on Hamlet and do the fencing scene. l could play Laertes. l took fencing lessons at the academy.
-Really?
-Yes, look.
Look. En garde!
-Splendid!
-Here.
''Come, for the third, Laertes, you but dally.''
''Say you so? Come on.''
-''Another hit; what say you?''
-''A touch, a touch, l do confess.''
What is this? What on earth?
What's going on? l don't know, sir.
''Have at you now! '' l say....
-Are you hurt?
-No.
-No, nothing ever hurts me.
-l'm sorry. l forgot you were a girl and l'm afraid l got a bit too rough.
What are you talking about? l had you bettered if l hadn't slipped.
That's a good picture of your grandfather.
He looks pretty grim, but l shouldn't be afraid of him.
Though l can see how his face might frighten some people. l'll wait upstairs, sir.
His eyes are kind and l like him even though he does bark at you so.
Thank you, ma'am.
So you're not afraid of me?
No, sir, not much.
But my face will frighten some people?
-l only said ''might.''
-And l bark, do l?
No, sir, perhaps not all the time.
But with all that, you like me?
Yes, sir. l do. l do.
And l like you.
Grandfather, you should see her fence.
Come on, let's show him.
-No. l've been here too long now.
-l'll see you home.
No, you stay indoors, young man. l shall see Miss March home. l want to pay my respects to your mother...
...and thank her for the medicine she sent my boy. l can see it's done him lots of good.
You get upstairs and do your sums.
Brooke is waiting for you.
And see that you behave yourself like a gentleman, sir.
Goodbye, Jo.
Here they come.
All dressed up and looking as pretty as pictures.
Amy, how dainty. You look lovely. l wish Laurie hadn't asked me to his party. l know l shall be frightened.
You wouldn't want to hurt his feelings when he's been so kind.
Meg, the dress is lovely.
Thank you, Marmee.
Jo, you look splendid. l feel perfectly miserable with 19 hairpins...
...all sticking straight into my head, but, dear me, let us be elegant or die.
Does the patch show much? lt does a little, Marmee.
But she's going to sit down or else stand with her back against the wall.
Jo, where are your gloves? l've stained them, so l'm going without.
You wear gloves or l don't go. l tried to clean them, but it only made them look worse. l'll carry them and hold them crumpled up in one hand.
-Nobody will see them.
-Jo! l'll tell you.
We'll each wear one of your nice ones...
...and carry one of my bad ones, then the effect will be fine and easy.
All right, only be careful of it, and don't stretch it.
And, Jo, dear, do behave nicely and don't put your hands behind your back.
Good night, Marmee.
Above everything, don't say:
''Christopher Columbus! ''...
...and disgrace us all.
Hold your tongue, Miss Baby. l'll be as prim as l can be and not get into any scrapes, if l can help it.
May l engage you for this dance,
Miss March?
No, thank you, l'm not dancing.
-There's that Kitty Ford.
-Where?
There in the pink dress and blue sash. l don't see why she's allowed with the grownups and l have to stay up here.
That beautiful piano. lt's as big as our kitchen.
What's this? Why aren't you young ladies downstairs dancing?
Mother said we weren't to go down with the grownups.
But can you see anything from here?
How about you?
She just likes to listen to the music.
You just come down with me where it's playing.
-No, sir, please. l....
-Why not? What's the matter?
She has an infirmity.
She's shy. l see. lf it weren't for that, she'd be simply ''fastidious''...
...because she plays beautifully.
She must come and play for me sometime.
No, she never would. lt wasn't that l wanted to hear her.
But that piano down there is simply going to ruin for want of use. l was hoping one of you young ladies would come and practice on it...
...just to keep it in tune.
-But if you don't care to come, never mind.
-Sir.
We do care. Very, very much.
So you're the musical one. l'm Beth. l love it dearly...
...and l'll come if you're quite sure nobody will hear me and be disturbed.
Not a soul, my child. Not a soul.
You come, too, young lady...
...and tell your mother l think all her daughters are simply ''fastidious.''
Beth, isn't he elegant?
This is the German, and l'll be hanged if l'll let you refuse me all of them.
Don't you like to dance?
Yes, l love to dance, but l can't.
-l mean, l promised l wouldn't.
-Why?
-l may as well tell you. You won't tell?
-Silence to the death.
You see, l have a bad trick of standing in front of the fire...
...and l scorched my frock and l burned this one.
Where?
You can laugh if you want to. lt is funny. l'll tell you how we'll manage.
There's no one in the hall.
We could dance there without being seen.
-You're a trump.
-And l think you're just perfectly splendid.
Hello.
What are you doing up there?
Come on down.
No, they can't.
Have you had refreshments?
No, thank you, we really don't care for--
We'll bring some right up. Come on.
Then when Laurie goes to college, what becomes of you? l shall turn soldier as soon as he is off. l am needed. l'm so sorry. l mean, l'm so sorry for all the mothers and sisters...
...who have to stay home and worry. l have neither and very few friends to care whether l live or die.
Laurie and his grandfather would care a great deal.
And we all would be very sorry if any harm came to you.
Would you?
Here we come.
Jo!
Now you've done it!
-Look at me.
-lt's a shame.
What a blunderbuss l am.
What are you going to do? l'll ask Marmee.
Have you two been hiding? l've been looking all over the house for you.
Hannah's here.
-ls it that late?
-Time slips away.
-Good night, Mr. Brooke.
-Good night, Miss Margaret.
Miss Margaret?
-Goodbye. l'm glad you came.
-We had an elegant time.
Good night, Amy.
Good night.
-Good night, Laurie.
-Good night, Miss Margaret.
Laurie!
Good night, everybody.
-Don't forget your ice skates tomorrow.
-l won't.
-Good night.
-Good night.
There, l've done my best. lf that won't do, l'll have to wait until l can do better.
Why, what are you up to? lt's a pair of slippers l worked for Mr. Laurence.
He's been so kind about letting me play on his beautiful piano. l didn't know any other way to thank him, Jo.
-Do you think they're all right?
-They're beautiful.
And l think you're sweet.
Hey, isn't that Amy's hair ribbon?
Yes, but l think she was going to throw it away.
You think?
You'd better vamoose before she catches you.
Now l'll find out why you come to this hole every day. ls that why you never have any time for me anymore?
Laurie Laurence, give that to me or l'll never speak to you again!
All right, take it.
You're a fine one. l thought we weren't to have any secrets from each other.
Well, this is altogether different. l beg your pardon.
Of course, it's different. Just like a girl.
Can't keep an agreement.
Oh, bilge!
You'll be sorry. l was going to tell you something very plummy.
A secret.
All about people you know, and such fun.
-What?
-lf l tell you, you must tell me yours.
-You won't say anything at home?
-Not a word.
-You won't tease me about it in private?
-l never tease. Fire away. l sold my story to the Spread Eagle.
Hurrah for Miss March.
Hurrah for Miss March!
The celebrated American authoress! l didn't want anyone to know until it's out.
-Won't it be fun to see it in print?
-Now, what's yours?
-l know where Meg's glove is.
-ls that all?
-Wait till you hear where it is.
-Where?
-How do you know?
-l saw it.
-Where?
-Pocket.
-All this time?
-lsn't it romantic?
''Romantic''? Rubbish! l never heard of anything so horrid. l wish you hadn't told me.
Of all the sickly sentimental....
Why do things always have to change just when they're perfect?
Meg always used to tell me everything.
Now she keeps things to herself.
She thinks brown eyes are beautiful and John is a lovely name.
He'd better keep away from me or l'll tell him what l think of him...
...trying to break up other people's happiness and spoil their fun. lt doesn't spoil any fun. lt makes it twice as good.
You'll find out when someone falls in love with you.
Soft summer day.
Sun setting through the trees.
Your lover's arms stealing around you.
-l'd like to see anybody try it.
-Would you? l'll get you!
Now l've got you.
Wait!
Look out, look out! Let me in, let me in!
-Hey, look out, Laurie. Don't act like that.
-l'm sorry, Meg. l'd have beaten her though if l hadn't tripped and fell.
You should have seen....
-lt's been a most enjoyable afternoon.
-Thank you.
Paying visits has never been quite so much fun before. l hope we may do it again very soon.
Goodbye, Mr. Brooke. Come along, Meg.
-Good afternoon, Mr. Brooke.
-Goodbye, Miss Margaret.
-Good afternoon, Laurie.
-Goodbye, Jo.
-Coming, Laurie?
-All right. See you tomorrow, Jo. l've never been so embarrassed in my life.
When will you stop your childish romping ways?
Not until l'm old and stiff, and have to use a crutch.
Jo!
-Hello, Bethie.
-Hello, Jo.
How's my girl?
There's a surprise.
-Come on and hurry up.
-Come on, Jo.
What is it?
Stop yelling. What is it?
Christopher Columbus!
For me? lsn't it the most beautiful piano you've ever seen?
Look, this came with it.
-Quick, read it. See what he says.
-l'll read it.
''To Miss Elizabeth March. Dear Madam.''
How elegant.
''l've had many pairs of slippers in my life, but none that suited me as well as yours.
''l like to pay my debts, so l know you will allow me to send you something...
''...that belonged to the little granddaughter l lost.
''With hearty thanks and best wishes...
''...l remain your grateful friend and humble servant, James Laurence.''
Oh, Bethie!
-lsn't he a really sweet old man?
-Look at these lovely brackets.
Look, it opens!
-You'll have to thank him.
-Yes. l'll go right now.
Well, l wish l may die!
She'd never have gone in her right mind.
Come in. l came to thank you, sir.
''But when the piece began, the dogs, the dames and private ends went mad...
''...and bit the man.
''Around from the neighboring streets the wondering neighbors ran...
''...and swore the dog'd lost his wits to bite so good a man.
''The wound seemed sore and sad to every Christian eye...
''...and while they swore the dog was mad--''
Look, Marmee.
Ms. March!
Ms. March. lt's one of them telegraph things, ma'am. lt's Father.
He's in the hospital. l must go to Washington at once.
Put those in the corner, dear.
What on earth is keeping Jo?
This is all packed, Marmee.
-l don't believe l've forgotten a thing.
-Thank you, dear.
While l'm away, don't forget the Hummel's.
-We won't.
-We'll do our best, Marmee.
Here we are. Here's some excellent port for your husband.
-Thank you. How generous.
-l hope you find this dressing gown useful.
Everything's arranged and Brooke will go with you.
There's no need. l'll be fine.
He's all prepared.
He has commissions for me in Washington.
-He'll be of help to you on the journey.
-How thoughtful of you. lt's such a relief to know that Marmee will have someone to take care of her.
Thank you, very, very much.
Not at all, Miss Margaret.
My kind friend, l can't thank you....
Laurie's outside with the carriage.
We'll wait for you.
The train leaves in an hour.
Here, ma'am, you'll need this.
-l couldn't.
-Please, Marmee, take it.
Where is Jo?
-Jo, what kept you?
-Jo, whatever took you so long?
Here's the money from Aunt March.
And there's my contribution.
$25. Where did you get it?
-My dear!
-lt's mine, honestly. l only sold what belonged to me.
Your hair!
Jo, you shouldn't have done it.
Aunt March croaked, as she always does, when asked for nine pence.
Marmee, she only sent you just money enough for the ticket. l knew you would need more...
...so l happened to be going past a barber shop...
...and l saw some tails of hair hanging in the window...
...with the prices marked on them...
...and l thought it would do my brain good to have my mop cut off.
And so l did.
Thank you, dearie.
Are you ready, Marmee?
We'll have to hurry to catch....
Christopher Columbus!
Well, it's boyish, becoming, and easy to keep in order.
-Marmee, you'll miss your train.
-Yes, Marmee, come on.
-Now, girls, go on with your work as usual.
-We will, Marmee.
Can't we go to the train with you,
Marmee?
No, l want you all to stay here and comfort each other.
Meg, dear, watch over your sisters.
Be patient, Jo.
Jo, don't do anything rash.
Beth, dear, help all you can.
Amy, be obedient.
No, l want you to stay here. l want to carry away a picture in my mind of my brave little women to take to Father.
-Goodbye, my darlings.
-Goodbye, Marmee.
God bless us and keep us all.
Jo, are you awake?
Jo, you're crying.
No, l'm not.
Don't cry, dear.
Father will be all right and Mr. Brooke will take care of Marmee. l'm not crying because of that.
What then?
My hair.
''Yet 'tis whispered that when the gondolas glide through those fatal waters...
''...they still run crimson with the blood of Lady Viella and her gallant lover...
''...slain by the phantom hand.
''The End.'' lt gives me the shivers. l'm pins and needles all over. lt's so exciting and so sad. Who wrote it?
Your sister.
-Really, Jo?
-What?
Let me see.
-And l knew it all the time.
-lsn't that wonderful?
Here it is: ''By Miss Josephine March.''
Oh, Jo! l can't believe it!
Beth!
Jo's written a story and it's in the paper. lsn't that marvelous?
-Really?
-Look!
Don't come near me.
Something's wrong with Beth.
What is it?
-l don't know.
-Where is she? ln Marmee's cupboard.
What's wrong? What's going on?
Darling, what is it?
Bethie, what is it?
-What's wrong, Bethie?
-What is it?
The baby's dead.
-What baby?
-Mrs. Hummel's. lt died in my lap...
...before she got back with the doctor, Jo.
Now, there, there.
The doctor said it was scarlet fever.
-Scarlet fever!
-Hannah!
You don't think l'll get it, do you, Jo?
Oh, no, Bethie, of course you won't.
But Amy must keep away
'cause she's never had it.
How does it start, Jo?
With a sort of a headache and sore throat...
...and queer feelings all over? l don't remember.
Laurie, give me that doctor's book.
Jo, l think we'd better get her to bed.
Come along, Bethie. l'll find out what to do.
-l'll be all right.
-Of course you'll be all right.
Here it is.
Go get Dr. Bangs, will you, Mr. Laurie?
Have him come over as soon as he can.
You stay down here, Amy. You're to go off to Aunt March's for a spell, just in case. l won't! l'll stay right here with Beth.
Be quiet for once, Amy! l'm not going to be sent away. l advise you to go, Amy.
Scarlet fever's no joke.
Well, l don't care! l'd rather get scarlet fever and die than go to Aunt March's.
Now, Amy, be a good girl. l'll pop around there every day and tell you how Beth is. l'll tell you what. Every day, l'll come and take you out driving.
-Well, yes.
-That's our girl.
Oh, Bethie, if you should really be ill, l'll never forgive myself. l let you go to the Hummel's every day when l should've gone.
No, it's my fault. l'm the oldest and l should've gone. l promised Marmee l'd look after you.
Don't you think we ought to telegraph her?
No, we mustn't.
She can't leave your father and it'll only make her all the more anxious.
Please don't telegraph, Jo.
Hannah knows just what to do. l feel better already. lf Mrs. March can leave her husband, we'd better send for her.
The girls had the telegram all ready, but l wouldn't let them send it.
And now, the poor lady.
Oh, Mother.
What if she shouldn't get here in time? ls it that bad?
She doesn't know me.
She doesn't look like my Beth.
How are we going to bear it?
Mother and Father, they seem so far away. l'm here.
Hold on to me.
Jo, dear.
Poor Jo. You're all worn out.
What does the doctor say?
We're sending for Marmee. lf she were only here.
She will be. Grandfather and l got fidgety and thought your mother ought to know.
She'd just never forgive us if Beth....
Well, if anything happened...
...so l telegraphed yesterday.
She'll be here, on the 2:00 train tonight, and l'm going to meet her.
Oh, Laurie! Oh, Marmee! l beg your pardon, but you're such a dear. l couldn't help flying at you.
Fly at me again. l rather like it.
Laurie, you're so silly. l'd better go.
Well, to the railroad station.
And l shan't spare the horses.
Bless you, Laurie, bless you. lf you really want Bethie...
...please wait until Marmee comes home.
But, God, please don't...
...because she's so....
Please don't. lf God spares Bethie...
...l'll love him and serve him all my life. lf life's as hard as this, l don't see how we shall ever get through it.
What is it? What is it?
Goodbye, my Bethie.
Goodbye.
The fever's turned.
-She's sleeping naturally.
-The Lord be praised.
Marmee's here. She's come. lt's so wonderful to have Bethie with us.
Come on, everything's all ready. ls she all right?
She's not very heavy, is she? lt didn't tire you, did it, dear?
See the lovely flowers
Mr. Laurence sent you.
And my birds. l've never been so happy.
Begging your pardon, do the Marches live here?
Wait till she sees what l brought for her.
Father, dear.
Father, is it really you? l can't believe she's walking.
-Oh, my dear.
-She hasn't walked since she was ill.
Are you expecting someone?
Why, no. What do you mean?
Why can't we stay as we are?
Do you have to go and fall in love...
...and spoil all our peace and fun and happy times together?
You're not like your old self a bit.
And you're getting so far away from me.
Meg, don't.
Don't go and marry that man. l don't intend to go and marry any man.
And if you mean Mr. Brooke, he hasn't asked me. lf he should, l shall merely say quite calmly and decidedly:
''l'm sorry but l agree with Mother that it's too soon.''
Oh, Meg! Hurrah for you! You're a trump.
My hair.
Then things will be as they used to be, and now that Father's home-- l'll go. l'll get out of the way.
Now don't forget. lf l could only see his face when you tell him.
Why, Mr. Brooke.
Good day, Miss Margaret.
Won't you come in? l came to get my umbrella.
That is to see how your father finds himself today.
Why, he's here in the rack. l mean, it's very well. l mean.... l'll tell him you're here.
Oh, please.
Are you afraid of me, Margaret?
How could l be when you've been so kind to Father? l only wish l could thank you for it.
You can.
-Shall l tell you how?
-No.
Please don't. l only want to know if you care for me a little, Meg. l love you so much, dear.
Thank you, John. l agree with Mother, it's too soon. l'll wait. l don't mind how long or how hard l have to work...
...if l can only know l'm to have my reward in the end.
Please, give me a little hope. l'm afraid l can't.
Do you really mean that?
What's this?
What's he doing here? Get along.
What's going on here? Who is that?
Mr. Brooke.
The Laurence boy's tutor. Then it's true.
He might hear you.
He's been so kind to Father.
Well, he'll be much kinder if he goes about his own business...
...and leaves you alone. l won't stop. l'm only thinking of your own good,
Margaret.
You should make a rich match to help your family.
This rude person has no money, no position in life.
That doesn't mean he never will have.
So he's counting on my money.
He knows you've got rich relatives.
Aunt March, how dare you say such a thing.
My John wouldn't marry for money any more than l would. l'm not afraid of being poor.
And l know we shall be happy because John loves me and l love him.
Hoity-toity.
Remember this, young lady: lf you marry this rook or hook or crook, he'll take care of you.
Not one penny of my money will he get.
My darling, did you mean it? l came back for my umbrella and l couldn't help hearing.
Then you will give me leave to work for you and love you?
Yes, John.
''And there to have given and pledged their troth each to the other...
''...and have declared the same by giving and receiving a ring and by joining hands...
''...l pronounce that they are man and wife.
''ln the name of the Father, of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.
''Amen.''
''God the Father, God the Son...
''...and God the Holy Ghost...
''...bless, preserve and keep you...
''...that ye may so live together in this life...
''...that in the world to come ye may have life everlasting.
''Amen.''
The first kiss for Marmee.
Well, John, you've been a traitor. l hope you'll take care of her.
You're a lucky fellow, John.
-Goodbye, Amy.
-Goodbye.
Don't mind, Jo.
You've still got me. l'm not good for much, l know...
...but l'll stand by you...
...all the days of my life. l know you will.
You don't know what a comfort you are to me, Laurie.
-Jo--
-No, don't say it. l will, and you must hear me. lt's no use, Jo.
You've kept away from me ever since l got back from college. l studied so hard and l graduated with honors, all for you.
-l know, and l'm so proud of you.
-Then won't you listen?
Please. l've loved you ever since l've known you. l couldn't help it. l've tried to show it, but you wouldn't let me.
Now l'm going to make you hear it and give me an answer...
...for l just can't go on so any longer. l know l'm not half good enough for you.
But if you love me, you can make me anything you like.
As though l'd change you, Laurie.
You should marry some lovely, accomplished girl who adores you.
Someone who would grace your beautiful home. l shouldn't. l loathe elegant society and you like it.
And you hate my scribbling and l can't get on without it.
And we should quarrel.
-No, we shouldn't.
-Yes, we always have, you know.
Everything would be horrid if we were ever foolish enough to--
Marry? No, it wouldn't, Jo. lt would be heaven.
Don't disappoint us, dear. Don't.
Everybody expects it.
Grandfather has set his heart on it.
And l just can't go on without you.
Please, say you will. l can't.
Laurie, l'm sorry.
So desperately sorry. l'm so grateful to you, and so proud and fond of you. l don't know why l can't love you the way you want me to. l've tried, but l can't change the feeling...
...and it would be a lie to say l do if l don't.
Really truly, Jo?
Really truly, dear. l don't think l'll ever marry.
Yes, you will.
You'll meet some good-for-nothing, no-account idiot...
...and you'll fall in love with him, and work, live and die for him. l know you will. lt's your way.
And l'll have to stand by and see it.
Well, l'll be hanged if l do.
Where are you going?
To the devil, and l hope you'll be sorry.
Laurie, please....
Why aren't you in bed? lt's late.
Mother, l want to go away. l mean, just for a little while. l don't know. l feel restless and anxious to be doing something. l'd like to hop a little way and try my wings.
Where would you hop?
To New York. l've thought about it a lot lately.
You can spare me now. l could go to Mrs. Kirke's and help with the children as part of my board. lt wouldn't cost much, and l'd see and hear new things...
...and get a lot of new ideas for my stories. l don't doubt it.
Jo, nothing's happened between you and Laurie?
Don't be surprised, dear.
Mothers have to have sharp eyes...
...especially when their daughters keep their troubles to themselves.
Oh, Marmee, l'd have told you, only l thought it would blow over...
...and it seemed kind of wrong to tell Laurie's poor little secret. lt's only that he's got a foolish romantic notion in his head...
...and l think if l go away for a time, he may get over it. l see.
And how do you feel about this ''foolish romantic notion''? l love him dearly as l always have. l feel as though l've stabbed my dearest friend.
And yet, l don't want to make a mistake.
You're right, Jo. l think it would be a good idea for both your sakes.
Now, come to bed, dear. l'll talk to Father about it.
And if he agrees, we'll write to Mrs. Kirke.
-Good night, dear.
-Good night, Marmee.
Now, my dear, l think l've told you everything...
...and it will be a great load off my mind knowing the children are safe with you. l'm very busy so l'll have Mamie show you to your room.
Mamie! l've given you a little inside room. lt's all l had...
...but it has a table and you can use it for your writing.
That's great.
Mamie!
You must come down here some after dinner and be sociable. l promised your mother l wouldn't let you be homesick...
...and l have only the most refined people in my house.
Mamie!
Here l am, Ms. Kirke.
Mamie, this is Miss Josephine.
Will you take her up to her room and find the children? l'll see you later, my dear.
Right this way, please.
Children, children!
They ain't a bad lot but, my stars, they take a deal of handling.
Jimmy! Kitty!
You heard me.
Come on out, l know where you are.
The bear's going to eat my baby.
Save my poor baby.
My baby! Don't eat my baby!
Professor! l beg your pardon.
Please. l'm so sorry.
This is Miss Josephine what's got you in charge now.
-Hello.
-How do you do?
-And this is Professor Bhaer.
-How do you do?
-Come on, let's finish the game.
-l want to play some more.
That is for Miss Josephine to say, but we've frightened her already.
Oh, no, but l didn't expect to meet a grizzly bear in the upper hall.
Mamie, wait.
The back is too young to carry such heavy loads.
Come on, children, let's play soldiers.
Tina, you are the general.
You're the captain. And here, Lieutenant.
Forward march!
He's such a lovely man. l know he must've been a gentleman sometime or other...
...but he's as poor as a church mouse now.
What does he do?
He's a professor, see?
He learns them how they talk in foreign countries. l don't know what good it does them when they're living right here.
Good evening, my little friend, good evening.
Please, don't stop. lt was beautiful. l've heard you play it often and wanted to ask you what it was. l'd so like to send it to my little sister.
Nur wer die Sehnsucht kennt.
The words are by Goethe.
Do you speak German?
Then l'd better give it to you in English.
Let's see now.
''Only who knows what longing is
''Can know what l suffer
''Alone and parted far from joy and gladness
''My senses fail
''A burning fire devours me
''My senses fail
''A burning fire devours me'' l know how he felt.
Tchaikovsky did, also.
That is why he wrote this beautiful, heartbreaking music. lf only l could write something like that.
Something splendid that would set other hearts on fire.
That is genius.
Do you wish to write, my little friend?
Yes, that's my longing. l've sold two stories already since l've been here.
That is very good. l'd like to read them. May l?
Would you? l'd so like to know your opinion. l would be very happy.
You have the ardent spirit. l like that.
What shall l ask for at the music shop? l think l'd better write it down for you.
Well, now, here is a teacher without a pencil.
Let me sew that button for you before you lose it.
No, l sew on buttons.
Not very well, evidently.
Well.
-Who was Goldilocks, a little girl?
-Yes.
''And she...
''...went into their house...
''...and saw three chairs.
''Three chairs.
''One was the baby one, one was the daddy one...
''...and one was the mommy one.
''So she sat down in the big one....
''And it was too hard.''
Miss Josephine, you're to go to the parlor right away.
Someone to see you.
-Who is it?
-l can't tell you. lt's a surprise.
All right, children, that will be all for today.
Now run along and wash your hands and faces for tea.
-l'll finish the story tomorrow.
-All right.
-Who is it, Mamie?
-l can't tell you. lt's a surprise.
Are these some of your new stories?
Oh, they look...
...creepier than The Duke's Daughter.
Can l read them?
Yes, if you want to.
'' The Place of the Coventrys or The Secret of a Guilty Heart...
''...by Josephine March.''
Then it's true.
-Amy!
-Darling!
-Aunt March!
-Josephine. l'm so glad to see you.
What took you so long to get down?
Tell me everything.
We can't stop now.
We've got to get to the shipping office before it closes.
Shipping office? Aunt March, Europe? l'm taking Amy with me.
Well, maybe you can go next time.
Next time?
Tell me, is Meg all right?
And Marmee and Father?
And how's my Beth?
She's better again, but she isn't rosy as she used to be.
Oh, my poor Beth.
Why doesn't she get strong?
And Laurie?
Didn't you see them when they were here?
He and his grandfather have been in Europe for weeks.
Laurie in New York?
And didn't come to see me? l'm sure you can't blame him after the way you picked up...
...and trotted off without so much as saying goodbye to any of us. l think you've treated everybody shamefully.
Come along, Amy.
Jo, dear, l wish it were you. l know how you've always longed to go.
No, darling. lt's your reward.
You've always done sweet things to please Aunt March.
Think of all the wonderful things you are going to see:
The Turners, the Raphaels and the Leonardos.
You seem to forget waiting cabs cost money.
That's the trouble with folks who never had anything.
Easy come, easy go.
We'll be right back, Josephine.
Goodbye, darling.
Miss Josephine?
Yes, Professor Bhaer. l have read your stories and l would like to return them to you.
Will you please come in?
Yes, thank you.
Did you like them?
Well, Miss March, l must be honest. l was disappointed.
Why do you write such artificial characters...
...such artificial plots, villains, murderers and such women?
Why don't you write a....
Miss March, please. l am so sorry. l didn't want to hurt you. l wanted to help you.
What a blundering fool l am. lt isn't that.
Please, don't pay any attention to me.
Forgive me, please. Come, sit down.
Forgive me.
No, it's just that everything seems to come at once.
The rest doesn't matter so much. l can bear that.
But Laurie, l can never get over Laurie.
Herr Laurie, your friend.
-Something has happened to him?
-Yes.
No, something has happened to me.
He came to New York and he didn't even come to see me.
What a fool he must be.
No, it's my fault. But l thought that....
What does it matter what l thought? l've made a mess of it as l do of everything.
But l have tried and when l think of Aunt March taking Amy to Europe...
...when she always promised she'd take me...
...not that l begrudge Amy the trip, but.... l suppose that's just what l am doing.
That trip to Europe that you so looked forward to.
That is too bad.
That is a cruel disappointment, l know.
On top of it, that stupid professor.
He comes blundering and makes things worse.
No. lf l can't stand the truth, l'm not worth anything. l didn't think those stories were so very good.
But you see...
... The Duke's Daughter paid the butcher's bill...
...and the Curse of the Coventrys was the blessing of the Marches...
...because it sent Marmee and Beth to the seashore.
Yes, that is what l have thought.
And then l have said to myself:
''l maybe have no right to speak.''
But then again, l said to myself:
''l maybe have no right to be silent.''
Miss March, you have talent.
-Do you really think so?
-Otherwise l could not say.
And you know that.
And l say to you,
''Sweep mud on the street first...
''...before you are false to that talent.''
Say to yourself:
''l will never write one single line which l have not heard in my own heart.''
Say to yourself, ''While l am young...
''...l will write these simple, beautiful things that l understand now.
''Maybe later, when l am a little older and l have felt life more...
''...then l will write about these poor wretches...
''...but l will make them live and breathe like my Shakespeare did.''
-Will you do that, my little friend?
-Yes, l'll try.
But l don't think l'll ever be a Shakespeare, do you?
But you can be a Josephine March.
And l assure you that is plenty.
And now, don't be disappointed about that trip.
-Here.
-Peppermint, good.
Those of us who have been all over the Old World...
...can find many things in the New...
...that are beautiful and young.
Miss March, it would give me great pleasure...
...if l could show you some of these things while you are here. lf you would care to have so.
Thank you.
Then you are not angry with the blundering professor...
...who takes the wrong times for his lectures?
How could l be?
Auf Wiedersehen, my little friend.
Did you really like it?
-l never had such a....
-Happy, my little friend.
She was divine. l don't want to be a writer anymore. l want to be a wonderful singer and thrill thousands of people...
...so that they cheer and throw flowers at me like that.
Bravo. Bravo.
But l wouldn't make up my mind so soon...
...because at the art museum you wanted to be a sculptress...
...at the circus you thought the bareback rider...
...was the most beautiful thing in the world. l know, but to sing like that! l forgot.
Something inside me tonight makes me want to shout.
What would you shout? l'd say, ''Look at me, world. l'm Jo March and l'm so happy.''
My little friend, you are happy.
You haven't missed much lately your home and your old friends?
But you're responsible for that.
Maybe they haven't missed me so much either.
They're so busy with Meg and those blessed babies.
Yes, how are those remarkable twins?
Wonderful. Meg's so proud of them.
Have you heard from Europe?
Nearly every boat brings a letter from Amy.
And your friend...
...Herr Laurie, have you heard from him?
Only through Amy. They met at Vichy and had a wonderful time together.
Miss March, l am bold to ask a favor.
Would you give me the address of your father? l wish to write him and ask him something.
Why, yes.
He'd be so happy to hear from you.
They almost know you. l've told them all about you.
And they always ask after you in their letters.
-Really?
-Yes, now l'll show you.
This is so nice.
Not l hope.... lt's Beth. She's.... l must go at once.
My friend, can l do something for you? l'm sure there is something l can do.
No, there's nothing. Thank you.
Oh, Jo...
...to think you're home. lf Amy were here, we'd all be together.
She'll be home in the spring, darling.
And l'm going to have you all well and rosy by then.
Poor Jo, you mustn't be afraid.
Doesn't that sound funny...
...me saying that to you when you've always said it to me?
You've always reminded me...
...of a seagull, strong and wild...
...and fond of the wind and the storm...
...dreaming of flying far out to sea.
And Mother always said that l was like a little cricket...
...chirping contentedly on the hearth...
...never able to bear the thought of leaving home.
But now...
...it's different. l can't express it very well. l shouldn't try to, to anyone but you...
...because l can't speak out to anyone but my Jo. l'm not afraid anymore. l'm learning that l don't lose you, that you'll be more to me than ever...
...and nothing can part us, though it seems to.
Oh, Jo. l think l'll be homesick for you even in heaven.
The little loves.
-l'm afraid they're tiring you.
-Oh, no. lt's time for my little regiment to take its nap.
-They're sweet.
-Yes. l think l can sleep now.
Look, Jo, my birds.
They got back in time.
-Bethie!
-Mother!
My daughter!
Bethie!
Oh, Marmee.
We mustn't cry.
We must be glad she's well at last.
No, Marmee, don't cry. lf only there were another boat leaving sooner.
Now, my dear, you've been so brave, you must be patient.
We're going back on the very first boat. l still think you should obey your mother and stay. l know. But l'm sick for home, Aunt March. l hate all this now. lf it weren't for this, l'd have been there, at least to say goodbye.
Laurie, l knew you'd come.
My child!
Mr. Laurence!
Amy, we were in Germany, and Marmee's letter had to be forwarded...
...but l came the moment l got it because....
Well, you must comfort me now, too. l'm so thankful you're here. l haven't known what to do with the child.
Perhaps you can persuade her to stay.
-The elegant young matron.
-Hello, Jo, dear. l've Sally Moffat's carriage. l'm making some calls.
You want me to mind the demons while you're gone?
No, l want you to go with me.
Jo, dear. lt's a lovely day and l want to talk to you.
Talk to me now.
You know l can't bear calls.
-How's your story coming?
-Sent it off yesterday.
-Without us reading it?
-You can read it when they send it back.
-l had a letter from Amy.
-So did Marmee.
They're in Valrosa now and she says it's paradise.
Jo, l'd like to ask you something. l've been wondering...
...how would you feel...
...if you should hear that your Laurie was learning to care for somebody else?
Meg, who?
Amy? l don't know. l can't be sure. l'm only reading between the lines.
Then you wouldn't mind?
No, Meg. How could l? l think it would be wonderful, don't you?
Yes, but l wasn't quite sure.
Forgive me, dear...
...but l have so much and you seem so alone. l thought lately that maybe if Laurie came back--
No, dear. lt's better as it is.
And l'm glad if he and Amy are learning to love each other.
You're right about one thing though. l am lonely and maybe if Laurie had come back...
...l might've said yes.
Not because l love him any differently, but because...
...it means more to me now to be loved than it used to.
Laurie.
Oh, my Laurie!
Jo, dear. Are you glad to see me?
Glad?
My blessed boy!
Words can't express my gladness.
And where's your wife?
They all stopped in at Meg's, but l couldn't wait to see you.
They'll be along presently.
Let me look at you.
Don't l look like a married man and the head of a family?
Not a bit, and you never will, although you have grown bigger and bonnier.
But you're the same scapegrace as ever, despite that very elegant mustache.
-You can't fool me.
-You have to treat me with more respect.
Jo, dear, l want to say one thing, then we'll put it by forever.
No, Laurie, please. l think it was always meant to be, you and Amy. lt would have come about naturally if only you'd waited.
As you tried to make me understand.
But you never could be patient.
So then we can go back to the happy old times?
The way you wanted it, when we first knew one another.
We never can be boy and girl again, Laurie.
Those happy old times can't come back.
We shouldn't expect them to.
We're man and woman now, we can't be playmates any longer.
But we can be brother and sister, to love and help one another...
...all the rest of our lives, can't we, Laurie?
There they are.
You look very well, Aunt March.
After the money spent on my rheumatism, l come home on a day like this.
Heaven's to Betsy. lf she ain't dressed in silk from head to foot.
Where is she? Where is Jo?
-Jo!
-Amy!
Doesn't she look marvelous, Jo? l'll never forgive myself for staying away so long...
...and leaving you to bear everything all alone.
Darling.
To think that only yesterday we were pulling our hair and buttoning pinafores.
And now she's a grown-up married lady with a bustle.
You must be famished. l'll help Hannah with the tea.
No, you won't, Marmee.
You'll sit right here. l'll help Hannah. lt's fun, isn't it, Bethie?
Now that we're all together again.
Oh, dear. l've got to get some milk. l haven't enough for my babies. l'll go.
-But it's raining cats and dogs.
-l love it.
Sakes alive! There's the front doorbell.
-ls this the residence of Miss March?
-Why, yes.
-Miss Josephine March?
-Yes.
May l speak with her?
She's out, but l'm expecting her back any minute.
-Won't you come in?
-Thank you.
No, thank you. She has guests, no.
Thank you very much.
But will you please give this to her and tell her Professor Bhaer left it?
Thank you.
Professor Bhaer. Thank you very much.
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.
-Herr Professor.
-My little friend. l was just here to leave your book. l wanted to tell you my friend published it, and he has great hopes.
-He thinks--
-Never mind what he thinks.
Did you like it?
My little friend, it has such truth, such simple beauty. ln English quick, l cannot tell you what it gives my heart.
But you were going without telling me. lf l hadn't come back, l never would've seen you again.
-Come, you're getting wet.
-l couldn't intrude. You have guests.
No, only my family.
My sister has just come home.
She is married to that boy l told you about.
-Herr Laurie?
-Yes.
This is the first time we've all been together for a long time.
Please, just one moment before.... l had a wish to ask you something.
Would you.... l have no courage to think that....
But could l dare hope that.... l know l shouldn't make so free as to ask. l have nothing to give but my heart so full and these empty hands.
Not empty now.
Heart's dearest!
Welcome home.
She isn't coming yet, Toto.
Did she hurt you?
She tried to, didn't she?
Come on. We'll go tell Uncle Henry and Auntie Em. Come on, Toto.
Aunt Em! Aunt Em!
Just listen to what Miss Gulch did to Toto...
Dorothy, please. We're counting.
- But she hit him...
- Don't bother us now, honey.
The incubator's gone bad and we're likely to lose a lot of our chicks.
Oh, that poor little thing.
But Miss Gulch hit Toto with a rake...
...because she says he chases her nasty old cat every day!
- Seventy. Dorothy, please!
But he doesn't do it every day!
Just once or twice a week.
He can't catch her old cat anyway.
- And now she says she's gonna...
- Dorothy. Dorothy, we're busy.
Oh, all right.
How's she coming?
Take it easy.
Ow!
You got my finger!
Get your finger out of the way.
There you are.
Right on my finger!
Lucky it wasn't your head.
Zeke, what am I gonna do about
Miss Gulch? Just because Toto...
Listen, honey,
I got them hogs to get in.
Dorothy, you ain't using your head.
You'd think you didn't have any brains.
- I have so got brains.
- Well, why don't you use them?
Don't go by Miss Gulch's place.
Then Toto won't get in her garden, and you won't get in no trouble, see?
Oh, Hunk, you just won't listen, that's all.
Well, your head ain't made of straw, you know.
Say, get in there before I make a dime bank out of you.
Listen, kid...
...are you gonna let that old Gulch heifer try and buffalo you?
She ain't nothing to be afraid of.
Have a little courage.
I'm not afraid of her.
Next time she squawks, walk up to her and spit in her eye.
- That's what I'd do.
- Oh! Oh!
Oh! Zeke!
Help! Help me, Zeke!
Get me out of here!
Help!
Oh! Oh!
Are you all right, Dorothy?
- Yes, I'm all right.
I fell in, and Zeke...
Why, Zeke, you're just as scared as I am.
You gonna let a little old pig make a coward out of you?
Look at you...
What's all this jabber-wapping when there's work to be done?
I know three farm hands that'll be out of a job.
Dorothy was...
I saw you tinkering with that contraption.
- You and Hunk get back to that wagon.
All right.
But someday they'll erect a statue to me...
Well, don't start posing for it now.
Can't work on an empty stomach.
Have some crullers.
Gosh, Mrs. Gale.
Just fried.
You see, Dorothy toppled into the...
It's no place for Dorothy around a pigsty!
Feed those hogs before they worry themselves into anemia!
- Yes.
- Auntie Em...
...you know what Miss Gulch said she was going to do to Toto?
- She said she'd...
Stop imagining things.
You always get in a fret over nothing.
You just help us out today...
...and find yourself a place where you won't get into any trouble.
Someplace where there isn't any trouble.
Do you suppose there is such a place, Toto?
There must be.
It's not a place you can get to by a boat or a train.
It's far, far away.
Behind the moon...
...beyond the rain...
Somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
There's a land that I heard of
Once in a lullaby
Somewhere over the rainbow
Skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream
Really do come true
Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds
Are far behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
Away above the chimney tops
That's where you'll...
...find me
Somewhere over the rainbow
Bluebirds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then...
...oh, why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly
Beyond the rainbow
Why, oh, why...
...can't I?
Mr. Gale.
Howdy, Miss Gulch.
I want to see you and your wife about Dorothy.
- What has Dorothy done?
- What's she done?
I'm all but lame from the bite on my leg!
- You mean, she bit you?
- No, her dog!
Oh, she bit her dog, eh?
No.
That dog's a menace. I'm taking him to make sure he's destroyed.
Destroyed! Toto?
Oh, you can't! You mustn't!
Auntie Em! Uncle Henry!
You won't let her, will you?
Of course we won't.
Uh, will we, Em?
Please, Aunt Em!
Toto didn't know he was doing anything wrong.
I'm the one that ought to be punished.
Send me to bed without supper.
Hand over that dog or I'll bring a suit that'll take your farm!
The law protects folks against dogs that bite!
How about if she keeps him tied up?
He's gentle.
- With gentle people, that is.
- That's for the sheriff to decide.
This order allows me to take him.
Unless you wanna go against the law.
Hm. Yes.
We can't go against the law.
I'm afraid poor Toto has to go.
- Now you're seeing reason.
- No.
Here's what I'm taking him in, so he can't attack me again.
No, No! I won't let you take him!
- You go away or I'll bite you myself!
Dorothy!
You wicked old witch! Uncle Henry,
Auntie Em, don't let her take Toto.
I've got an order!
- Let me have him!
- Please stop!
Put him in the basket, Henry.
- The idea!
- Don't, Uncle Henry.
Oh, Toto!
Almira Gulch, just because you own half the county...
...doesn't mean you can run the rest of us!
For 23 years I've been dying to tell you what I thought of you!
And now...
Well, being a Christian woman,
I can't say it!
Toto, darling!
Oh, I got you back!
You came back!
I'm so glad!
They'll be coming back for you in a minute.
We've got to get away!
We've got to run away!
Well, well, well! Houseguests, eh?
And who might you be?
No, no. Now, don't tell me.
Let's see. You're...
You're traveling in disguise.
No, that's not right. You're...
You're going on a visit.
No, I'm wrong. Let's see what we...
You're... You're running away.
How did you guess?
Professor Marvel never guesses, he knows.
Now, why are you running away?
No, no. Now, don't tell me.
They... They don't understand you at home. They don't appreciate you.
You want to see other lands.
Big cities, big mountains, big oceans.
Why, it's just like you could read what was inside of me.
Toto, that's not polite!
We haven't been asked yet.
Oh, he's perfectly welcome.
As one dog to another, huh?
Now, let's see, where were we?
Why can't we go with you and see all the crowned heads of Europe?
Do you know any?
Oh, you mean the thing. Yes.
Well, uh, I never do anything without consulting my crystal first.
Let's go inside here. We'll...
Just come along. I'll show you.
That's right. Here.
Sit right down here. That's it.
This is the same genuine, magic, authentic crystal...
...used by the priests of Isis and
Osiris in the days of the Pharaohs...
...in which Cleopatra saw the approach of Julius Caesar and Marc Anthony.
And so on, and so on. Now...
...you'd better close your eyes, my child, for a moment...
...in order to be better in tuned with the Infinite.
We can't do these things without reaching out into the Infinite.
Yes, that's all right.
Now you can open them.
We'll gaze into the crystal.
Ah.
What's this I see?
A house with a picket fence...
...and a barn with a weathervane...
...of a running horse.
- That's our farm!
- Yes.
Yes. There's a woman.
She's wearing a polka-dot dress.
Her face is careworn.
That's Aunt Em.
Yes. Her name is Emily.
That's right. What's she doing?
Well, I can't quite see.
Why, she's crying.
Someone has hurt her.
Someone has just about broken her heart.
Me?
Well, it's... It's someone she loves very much.
Someone she's been very kind to.
Someone she's taken care of in sickness.
I had the measles once, and she stayed right by me every minute.
Uh-huh.
What's she doing now?
Yes, she's... What's this?
Why, she's putting her hand on her heart!
- She's dropping down on the bed.
- Oh, no, no!
Well, that's all.
The crystal's gone dark.
You don't suppose she could really be sick, do you?
- Oh, I've gotta go home right away.
- I thought you were going with me.
No, I have to get to her right away!
Come on, Toto! Come on!
Goodbye, Professor Marvel.
And thanks a lot!
Better get under cover, Sylvester.
A storm's blowing up.
A whopper, to speak in the vernacular of the peasantry.
Poor little kid.
I hope she gets home all right.
Get them horses loose!
Where's Hickory? Hickory?
Doggone it!
It's a twister! It's a twister!
Dorothy!
Everybody in the storm cellar!
Henry, I can't find Dorothy!
She's out in the storm!
We can't look for her now.
Come on, get in the cellar!
Hurry up!
Auntie Em!
Auntie Em?
Auntie Em!
Auntie Em! Uncle Henry!
Auntie Em!
We must be up inside the cyclone!
Oh! Miss Gulch!
Oh!
Toto...
...I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.
We must be over the rainbow!
Now I know we're not in Kansas.
Are you a good witch or a bad witch?
Who, me?
Why, I'm not a witch at all.
- I'm Dorothy Gale, from Kansas.
- Oh.
Well, is that the witch?
Who, Toto? Toto's my dog.
I'm a little muddled. The Munchkins called me because a new witch...
...just dropped a house on the Wicked Witch of the East.
And there's the house, and here you are...
...and that's all that's left of the Wicked Witch of the East.
What the Munchkins want to know is, are you a good witch or a bad witch?
But I've already told you,
I'm not a witch at all.
Witches are old and ugly.
What was that?
The Munchkins. They're laughing because I am a witch.
I'm Glinda, the Witch of the North.
You are?
Oh, I beg your pardon!
But I've never heard of a beautiful witch before.
Only bad witches are ugly.
The Munchkins are happy because you freed them...
...from the Wicked Witch of the East.
- But if you please, what are Munchkins?
The little people who live here.
It's Munchkinland...
...and you are their national heroine, my dear.
It's all right.
You may all come out and thank her.
Come out, come out
Wherever you are
And meet the young lady
Who fell from a star
She fell from the sky
She fell very far
And Kansas, she says
Is the name of the star
Kansas, she says
Is the name of the star
She brings you good news
Or haven't you heard?
When she fell out of Kansas
A miracle occurred
It really was no miracle
What happened was just this
The wind began to switch
The house to pitch
And suddenly the hinges
Started to unhitch
Just then the Witch
To satisfy an itch
Went flying on her broomstick
Thumbing for a hitch
And oh, what happened then was rich
The house began to pitch
The kitchen took a slitch
It landed on the Wicked Witch
In the middle of a ditch
Which was not a healthy situation
For the Wicked Witch
The house began to pitch
The kitchen took a slitch
It landed on the Wicked Witch
In the middle of a ditch
Which was not a healthy situation
For the Wicked Witch
Who began to twitch
And was reduced to just a stitch
Of what was once the Wicked Witch
We thank you very sweetly
For doing it so neatly
You've killed her so completely
That we thank you very sweetly
Let the joyous news be spread!
The Wicked Old Witch at last is dead!
Ding-Dong! The Witch is dead
Which old witch? The Wicked Witch
Ding-Dong! The Wicked Witch is dead
Wake up, you sleepyhead
Rub your eyes, get out of bed
Wake up, the Wicked Witch is dead
She's gone where the goblins go
Below, below, below
Yo-ho! Let's open up and sing
And ring the bells out
Ding-Dong! The merry-o
Sing it high, sing it low
Let them know
The Wicked Witch is dead
As mayor of the Munchkin City
In the county of the Land of Oz
I welcome you most regally
But we've got to verify it legally
- To see
- To see?
- If she
- If she?
Is morally, ethically
- Spiritually, physically
- Positively, absolutely
Undeniably and reliably dead
As coroner I must aver
I thoroughly examined her
And she's not only merely dead
She's really most sincerely dead
Then this is a Day of Independence...
...for all the Munchkins and their descendants.
If any!
Yes, let the joyous news be spread.
The Wicked Old Witch at last is dead!
Ding-Dong! The Witch is dead
Which old witch? The Wicked Witch
Ding-Dong! The Wicked Witch is dead
Wake up, you sleepyhead
Rub your eyes, get out of bed
Wake up
The Wicked Witch is dead
She's gone where the goblins go
Below, below, below
Yo-ho! Let's open up and sing
And ring the bells out
Ding-Dong! The merry-o
Sing it high, sing it low
Let them know the Wicked Witch is dead

La...
I thought you said she was dead.
That was her sister, the Wicked Witch of the East.
This is the Wicked Witch of the West.
She's worse than the other one was.
Who killed my sister?
Who killed the Witch of the East?
Was it you?
No. No, it was an accident.
I didn't mean to kill anybody.
Well, my little pretty,
I can cause accidents too!
- Aren't you forgetting the ruby slippers?
- The slippers. Yes!
The slippers!
They're gone!
The ruby slippers!
What have you done with them?
Give them back to me or I'll...
It's too late! There they are, and there they'll stay!
Give me back my slippers!
Only I know how to use them.
They're of no use to you.
Give them back to me. Give them back!
Keep tight inside of them.
Their magic must be powerful...
...or she wouldn't want them so badly.
Stay out of this, Glinda, or I'll fix you as well!
Oh, rubbish!
You have no power here.
Begone, before somebody drops a house on you too.
Very well. I'll bide my time.
And as for you, it's true I can't attend to you here and now as I'd like.
But just try to stay out of my way!
Just try!
I'll get you, my pretty...
...and your little dog too!
It's all right. You can get up.
She's gone!
It's all right. You can all get up.
Oh! What a smell of sulfur!
I'm afraid you've made an enemy of the Wicked Witch.
The sooner you get out of Oz altogether, the safer you'll sleep, my dear.
Oh, I'd give anything to get out of Oz altogether.
But which is the way back to Kansas?
I can't go the way I came.
No, that's true.
The only person who might know...
...would be the great and wonderful
Wizard of Oz himself.
The Wizard of Oz?
Is he good or is he wicked?
Oh, very good, but very mysterious.
He lives in the Emerald City, a long journey from here.
Did you bring your broomstick with you?
- No, I'm afraid I didn't.
- Well, then, you'll have to walk.
The Munchkins will see you safely to the border of Munchkinland.
And remember, never let those ruby slippers off your feet for a moment...
...or you will be at the mercy of the Wicked Witch of the West.
But how do I start for Emerald City?
It's always best to start at the beginning.
And all you do is follow the Yellow Brick Road.
- But what happens if I...
- Just follow the Yellow Brick Road.
Goodbye!
My!
People come and go so quickly here!
Follow the Yellow Brick Road
Follow the Yellow Brick Road?
Follow the Yellow Brick Road
Follow the Yellow Brick Road
Follow the Yellow Brick Road
Follow, follow, follow, follow
Follow the Yellow Brick Road
Follow the Yellow Brick
Follow the Yellow Brick Road
You're off to see the Wizard
The wonderful Wizard of Oz
You'll find he is a whiz of a wiz
If ever a wiz there was
If ever, oh ever a wiz there was
The Wizard of Oz is one because
Because, because, because
Because, because
Because of the wonderful things he does
You're off to see the Wizard
The wonderful Wizard of Oz
Follow the Yellow Brick Road?
Follow the Yellow...?
Now which way do we go?
Pardon me!
That way is a very nice way.
Who said that?
Don't be silly, Toto.
- Scarecrows don't talk.
- It's pleasant down that way too.
That's funny.
Wasn't he pointing the other way?
Of course, people do go both ways.
Why, you did say something, didn't you?
Are you doing that on purpose, or can't you make up your mind?
That's the trouble.
I can't make up my mind.
I haven't got a brain.
Only straw.
How can you talk if you haven't got a brain?
I don't know.
But some people without brains do a lot of talking, don't they?
Yes, I guess you're right.
Well, we haven't really met properly, have we?
Why, no.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
- Very well, thank you.
- Oh, I'm not feeling at all well.
It's very tedious being stuck up here all day long with a pole up your back.
Oh, dear. That must be terribly uncomfortable. Can't you get down?
Down? No, you see, I'm...
Well, I'm...
Oh, well, here. Let me help you.
Oh, that's very kind of you.
Very kind.
Oh, dear. I don't see...
Of course, I'm not bright about doing things...
...but if you'll just bend the nail down, maybe I'll slip off and...
Oh, yes!
Whoops!
- There goes some of me again!
- Does it hurt you?
Oh, no. I just keep picking it up and putting it back in again.
My! It's good to be free!
Did I scare you?
No, no. I just thought you hurt yourself.
- But I didn't scare you?
- No, of course not.
I didn't think so.
Boo! Scat! Boo!
You see? I can't even scare a crow.
They come from miles around just to eat in my field and laugh in my face.
Oh, I'm a failure, because
I haven't got a brain!
Well, what would you do with a brain if you had one?
Do? Why, if I had a brain, I could...
I could while away the hours
Conferring with the flowers
Consulting with the rain
And my head I'd be scratchin'
While my thoughts were busy hatchin'
If I only had a brain
I'd unravel every riddle
For any individ'le
In trouble or in pain
With the thoughts you'd be thinkin'
You could be another Lincoln
If you only had a brain
Oh, I could tell you why
The ocean's near the shore
I could think of things
I never thunk before
And then I'd sit
And think some more
I would not be just a nothin'
My head all full of stuffin'
My heart all full of pain
I would dance and be merry
Life would be a ding-a-derry
If I only had a brain
Whoa!
Wonderful!
Why, if our scarecrow back in Kansas could do that...
...the crows would be scared to pieces!
- They would?
- Where's Kansas?
- That's where I live.
I wanna get back there so badly,
I'm going to Emerald City...
...to get the Wizard of Oz to help me.
- You're going to see a wizard?
- Mm-hmm.
Do you think if I went, this wizard would give me brains?
I couldn't say.
But even if he didn't, you'd be no worse off than you are now.
- Yes, that's true.
- But maybe you better not.
I've got a witch mad at me, and you might get into trouble.
Witch? I'm not afraid of a witch!
I'm not afraid of anything!
- Except a lighted match.
- I don't blame you for that.
But I'd face a whole box of them for the chance of getting some brains.
Look, I won't be any trouble, because I don't eat a thing.
And I won't try to manage things, because I can't think.
Won't you take me with you?
Why, of course I will!
Hooray! We're off to see a wizard!
You're not starting out very well.
Oh, I'll try! Really, I will.
- To Oz?
- To Oz!
We're off to see the Wizard
The wonderful Wizard of Oz
We hear he is a whiz of a wiz
If ever a wiz there was
If ever, oh ever a wiz there was
The Wizard of Oz is one because
Because, because, because
Because, because
Because of the wonderful things he does
We're off to see the wizard
The wonderful Wizard of Oz
Oh.
Apples!
Oh, look!
Oh!
Ouch!
What do you think you're doing?
We've been walking a long ways and I was hungry and...
Did you say something?
- She was hungry!
She was hungry!
How would like to have someone come along and pick something off of you?
Oh, dear! I keep forgetting
I'm not in Kansas.
Come along, Dorothy.
You don't want any of those apples.
Hmm.
Are you hinting my apples aren't what they ought to be?
Oh, no! It's just that she doesn't like little green worms.
Oh, you!
I'll show you how to get apples.
Oh! Oh!
Hooray! I guess that did it. Help yourself.
Why, it's a man!
A man made out of tin!
Yes!
Look!
Did you say something?
He said "oilcan. "
- Oil can what?
- Oilcan?
Oh, here it is.
Where do you want to be oiled first?
He said his mouth.
The other side.
Mm... Mm... Mm...
My goodness! I can talk again! Oh!
Oil my arms, please. Oil my elbows.
Here.
- Did that hurt?
- No, it feels wonderful.
I've held that axe up for ages.
Goodness!
How did you ever get like this?
Well, about a year ago...
...I was chopping that tree...
...when suddenly it began to rain.
And right in the middle of a chop,
I rusted solid.
And I've been that way ever since.
Well, you're perfect now.
My neck. My neck.
Perfect?
Bang on my chest if you think I'm perfect.
Go ahead, bang on it!
Beautiful! What an echo!
It's empty.
The tinsmith forgot to give me a heart.
- No heart?
- No heart?
No heart.
All hollow.
When a man's an empty kettle
He should be on his mettle
And yet I'm torn apart
Just because I'm presumin'
That I could be kind of human
If I only had a heart
I'd be tender, I'd be gentle
And awful sentimental
Regarding love and art
I'd be friends with the sparrows
And the boy who shoots the arrows
If I only had a heart
Picture me
A balcony
Above, a voice sings low
Wherefore art thou, Romeo?
I hear a beat
How sweet!
Just to register emotion
Jealousy, devotion
And really feel the part
I could stay young and chipper
And I'd lock it with a zipper
If I only had a heart
Oh! Oh, oh, oh, oh!
- Are you all right?
- I'm a little rusty yet.
Oh, dear!
That was wonderful!
You know, we were wondering why you couldn't come with us...
...to the Emerald City to ask the Wizard of Oz for a heart.
Suppose the Wizard wouldn't give me one when we got there.
Oh, but he will!
He must!
We've come such a long way already.
You call that long?
Why, you've just begun!
Helping the little lady along, are you, my fine gentlemen?
Well, stay away from her...
...or I'll stuff a mattress with you!
And you!
I'll use you for a beehive!
Here, scarecrow. Wanna play ball?
Fire! I'm burning! I'm burning!
I'm not afraid of her.
I'll see you get safely to the Wizard, whether I get a brain or not!
Stuff a mattress with me!
I'll see you reach the Wizard, whether I get a heart or not.
Beehive! Bah!
Let her try and make a beehive out of me.
Oh, you're the best friends anybody ever had.
And it's funny, but I feel as if
I've known you all the time.
- But I couldn't have, could I?
- I don't see how.
You weren't around when I was stuffed and sewn together, were you?
And I was standing over there rusting for the longest time.
Still, I wish I could remember.
But I guess it doesn't matter anyway.
We know each other now, don't we?
- That's right.
- We do.
- To Oz?
- To Oz!
We're off to see the Wizard
The wonderful Wizard of Oz
We hear he is a whiz of a wiz
If ever a wiz there was
If ever, oh ever a wiz there was
The Wizard of Oz is one because
Because, because, because
Because, because
Because of the wonderful things he does
We're off to see the Wizard
The wonderful Wizard of Oz
I don't like this forest.
It's dark and creepy.
Of course, I don't know, but I think it'll get darker before it gets lighter.
Do...
Do you suppose we'll meet any wild animals?
We might.
Animals that eat straw?
Some, but mostly lions and tigers and bears.
- Lions!
- And tigers?
And bears!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my!
Oh!
Put 'em up! Put 'em up!
Which one of you first?
I'll fight you both together, if you want.
I'll fight you with one paw tied behind my back!
I'll fight you standing on one foot!
I'll fight you with my eyes closed!
Oh, pulling an ax on me, eh?
Sneaking up on me, eh? Why...
- Here, here. Go away and let us alone.
- Oh, scared, huh?
Afraid, huh?
How long can you stay fresh in that can?
Come on, get up and fight, you shivering junkyard.
Put your hands up, you lopsided bag of hay!
That's getting personal, Lion.
Yes, get up and teach him a lesson.
What's wrong with you teaching him?
Well, I hardly know him.
Well, I'll get you anyway, peewee.
Shame on you!
What did you do that for?
I didn't bite him.
No, but you tried to.
It's bad enough picking on a straw man, but picking on poor little dogs...
Well, you didn't have to go and hit me, did you?
Is my nose bleeding?
Well, of course not.
My goodness, what a fuss you're making!
Well, naturally, when you go around picking on things weaker than you are...
You're nothing but a big coward!
You're right, I am a coward!
I haven't any courage at all.
I even scare myself!
Look at the circles under my eyes.
I haven't slept in weeks.
Why don't you try counting sheep?
That doesn't do any good.
I'm afraid of them.
Oh, that's too bad.
Don't you think the Wizard could help him too?
I don't see why not.
Come along with us.
We're on our way to see the Wizard.
To get him a heart.
- And him a brain.
- He could give you some courage.
Wouldn't you feel degraded to be seen in the company of a cowardly lion?
I would.
No, of course not.
Gee, that's awfully nice of you.
- My life has been simply unbearable.
- Oh.
Well, it's all right now.
The Wizard'll fix everything.
It's been in me so long.
I just gotta tell you how I feel.
Well, come on!
Yeah, it's sad,
Believe me, missy
When you're born to be a sissy
Without the vim and verve
But I could show my prowess
Be a lion, not a mouse
If I only had the nerve
I'm afraid there's no denyin'
I'm just a dandy lion
A fate I don't deserve
- I'd be brave as a blizzard
- I'd be gentle as a lizard
I'd be clever as a gizzard
If the Wizard is a wizard
Who will serve
Then I'm sure to get a brain
- A heart
- A home
The nerve!
Oh
We're off to see the Wizard
The wonderful Wizard of Oz
We hear he is a whiz of a wiz
If ever a wiz there was
If ever, oh ever a wiz there was
The Wizard of Oz is one because
Because, because, because
Because, because
Because of the wonderful things he does
We're off to see the Wizard
The wonderful Wizard of Oz
So you won't take warning, eh?
All the worse for you, then.
I'll take care of you now instead of later!
When I gain those ruby slippers...
...my power will be the greatest in Oz!
And now, my beauties...
...something with poison in it, I think.
With poison in it.
But attractive to the eye and soothing to the smell!
Poppies.
Poppies!
Poppies will put them to sleep.
Sleep...
Now they'll sleep.
There's Emerald City!
Oh, we're almost there!
At last! At last!
It's beautiful, isn't it?
Just like I knew it would be.
He really must be a wonderful wizard to live in a city like that.
Come on, what are we waiting for?
Nothing! Let's hurry!
Yes, let's run!
- Come on! Come on!
- Hurry! Hurry!
Oh, look!
Come on! Come on!
Look at the scenery. It's wonderful!
Emerald City!
Oh. What's happening?
What is it?
I can't run anymore.
- I'm so sleepy.
- Give us your hands and we'll pull you.
Oh, no, please.
I have to rest for just a minute.
Toto. Where's Toto?
You can't rest now.
We're nearly there.
Don't cry.
You'll rust yourself again!
Coming to think of it, forty winks wouldn't be bad.
- Don't you start it too!
- No!
We ought to carry Dorothy.
I don't think I could, but we could try.
- Let's.
- Yes.
- Now look at him. This is terrible!
- Here, Tin Man, help me.
Oh, this is terrible!
I can't budge her an inch.
This is a spell, this is!
It's the Wicked Witch! What'll we do?
Help! Help!
It's no use screaming at a time like this.
Nobody will hear you!
Help! Help!
Help!
It's snowing!
No, it isn't.
Yes, it is!
Maybe that'll help!
Oh, but it couldn't help!
It does help!
Dorothy, you're waking up!
Oh. Oh.
Unusual weather we're having, ain't it?
Look! He's rusted again.
- Oh, give me the oilcan, quick!
Here.
- He is rusted.
Here.
Here.
Quick! Oh! Oh!
Curses! Curses!
Somebody always helps that girl.
But shoes or no shoes,
I'm still great enough to conquer her.
And woe to those who try to stop me!
Come on, let's get out of here.
Look! Emerald City is closer and prettier than ever!
You're out of the woods
You're out of the dark
You're out of the night
Step into the sun
Step into the light
Keep straight ahead for
The most glorious place
On the face of the earth
Or the sky
Hold on to your breath
Hold on to your heart
Hold on to your hope
March up to the gate
And bid it open
To the Emerald City, as fast as lightning!
You're out of the woods
You're out of the dark
You're out of the night
Step into the sun
Step into the light
March up to the gate
And bid it...
...open
Open
Who rang that bell?
We did!
- Can't you read?
- Read what?
- The notice!
What notice?
- It's on the door!
As plain as the nose on my face!
Oh... Uh...
Oh! Tsk, tsk, tsk.
"Bell out of order. Please knock. "
Well! That's more like it!
Now, state your business.
We wanna see the Wizard.
The Wizard?
But nobody can see the great Oz.
Nobody's ever seen the great Oz!
Even I've never seen him!
Well, then, how do you know there is one?
Because he's...
Oh! You're wasting my time!
Oh, please. Please, sir.
I've got to see the Wizard.
- The Good Witch of the North sent me.
- Prove it!
She's wearing the ruby slippers that she gave her.
Oh! So she is!
Well, bust my buttons!
Why didn't you say that in the first place?
That's a horse of a different color!
Come on in!
Cabby! Cabby!
Just what you're looking for.
Take you any place in the city, we does.
- Would you take us to see the Wizard?
- The Wizard? The Wizard?
Yes, of course. But first I'll take you to a little place...
...where you can tidy up a bit.
- Oh, thank you so much!
We've been gone such a long time, and we feel so mess...
What kind of a horse is that?
I've never seen a horse like that before!
No, and never will again, I fancy.
There's only one of him, and he's it.
He's the horse of a different color you've heard tell about.
Ha-ha-ha! Ho-ho-ho!
And a couple of tra-la-las
That's how we laugh the day away
In the merry old land of Oz
Bzz, bzz, bzz!
Chirp, chirp, chirp!
And a couple of la-di-das
That's how the crickets crick all day
In the merry old land of Oz
We get up at twelve
And start to work at one
Take an hour for lunch
And then at two we're done
Jolly good fun!
Ha-ha-ha!
Ho-ho-ho!
And a couple of tra-la-las
That's how we laugh the day away
In the merry old land of Oz
Ha-ha-ha!
Ho-ho-ho!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
That's how we laugh the day away
With a
Ho-ho-ho!
Ha-ha-ha!
In the merry old land of Oz
Pat, pat here
Pat, pat there
And a couple of brand-new straws
That's how we keep you young and fair
In the merry old land of Oz
Rub, rub here
Rub, rub there
Whether you're tin or bronze
That's how we keep you in repair
In the merry old land of Oz
We can make a dimpled smile
Out of a frown
Can you even dye my eyes
To match my gown?
- Uh-huh
Jolly old town!
Clip, clip here
Clip, clip there
We give the roughest claws
That certain air of savoir-faire
In the merry old land of Oz
That's how we laugh the day away
In the merry old land of Oz
That's how we laugh the day away
With a ha-ha-ha
In the merry old land of Oz
Who's her? Who's her?
It's the witch!
She's followed us here!
"Surrender, Dorothy. "
Dorothy? Who's Dorothy?
- The Wizard will explain it!
- To the Wizard!
Dear! Whatever shall we do?
We better hurry if we're gonna see the Wizard!
Here! Here, here!
Everything is all right.
Stop that now, just...
It's all right!
Everything is all right!
The great and powerful Oz has got matters well in hand.
I hope.
So you can all go home!
There's nothing to worry about!
Get out of here. Now go on!
Go on home.
Go home.
We want to see the Wizard right away.
All four of us.
Orders are, nobody can see the great Oz! Not nobody, not nohow!
But, please! It's very important.
I got a permanent just for the occasion.
Not nobody, not nohow!
But she's Dorothy!
The witch's Dorothy?
Well, that makes a difference.
Just wait here.
I'll announce you at once.
Did you hear that?
He'll announce us at once.
- I've as good as got my brain.
- I can fairly hear my heart beating.
I'll be home for supper.
In another hour,
I'll be king of the forest.
Long live the king!
If I were king of the forest
Not queen
Not duke
Not prince
My regal robes of the forest
Would be satin
Not cotton
Not chintz
I'd command each thing
Be it fish or fowl
With a woof!
And a woof!
And a royal growl
As I'd click my heel
All the trees would kneel
And the mountains bow
And the bulls kowtow
And the sparrow would take wing
If I
If I were king
Each rabbit would show respect to me
The chipmunks genuflect to me
Though my tail would lash
I would show compash
For every underling
If I
If I were king
Just king
Monarch of all I survey
Monarch
Of all I survey
If you were king, you wouldn't be afraid of anything?
Not nobody, not nohow!
- Not even a rhinoceros?
- Imposserous!
- How about a hippopotamus?
- I'd trash him from top to "bottom-us. "
- Supposing you met an elephant?
- I'd wrap him up in "cello-phant"!
- What if it were a brontosaurus?
- I'd show him who's king of the forest!
How?
- How?
Courage!
What makes a king out of a slave?
Courage!
What makes the flag on the mast to wave? Courage!
What makes the elephant charge his tusk...
...in the misty mist or the dusky dusk?
What makes the muskrat guard his musk? Courage!
What makes the sphinx the Seventh Wonder? Courage!
What makes the dawn come up like thunder? Courage!
What makes the Hottentot so hot?
What puts the "ape" in apricot?
What have they got that I ain't got?
Courage!
- You can say that again.
Huh?
The Wizard says go away!
Go away?
Looks like we came a long way for nothing.
And I was so happy.
I thought I was on my way home.
Don't cry.
We're gonna get you to the Wizard.
We certainly are.
Auntie Em was so good to me...
...and I never appreciated it.
Running away and hurting her feelings.
Professor Marvel said she was sick.
She may be dying...
...and it's all my fault.
I'll never forgive myself.
Never, never, never.
Please don't cry anymore.
I'll get you into the Wizard somehow.
Come on.
I had an Aunt Em myself once.
Wait a minute, fellas.
I was just thinking, I really don't want to see the Wizard this much.
I better wait for you outside.
- What's the matter?
- He's just scared again.
Don't you know the Wizard will give you courage?
I'd be too scared to ask him for it.
Well, then, we'll ask him for you.
I'd sooner wait outside.
Why? Why?
Because I'm still scared!
- What happened?
- Somebody pulled my tail.
You did it yourself.
- Oh.
- Here.
Come on.
Come forward!
Tell me when it's over!
Look at that. Look at that!
I wanna go home!
I am Oz...
...the great and powerful!
Who are you?
If you please...
...I am Dorothy...
...the small and meek.
We've come to ask you...
- Silence!
- Oh!
Oh! Jiminy crickets!
The great and powerful Oz...
...knows why you have come.
Step forward...
...Tin Man!
You dare to come to me for a heart, do you?
You clinking, clanking, clattering...
...collection of caliginous junk!
Yes, sir.
Yes, Your Honor.
You see...
...a while back, we were walking down the Yellow Brick Road and...
Quiet!
And you, Scarecrow...
...have the effrontery to ask for a brain...
...you billowing bale of bovine fodder!
Yes, Your Honor.
I mean, Your Excellency.
I mean, Your Wizardry!
Enough!
And you, Lion!
Well?
You ought to be ashamed of yourself...
...frightening him like that when he came to you for help!
Silence, whippersnapper!
The beneficent Oz has every intention of granting your requests.
What's that? What'd he say?
Huh? What'd he say?
But first, you must prove yourselves worthy...
...by performing a very small task.
Bring me the broomstick of the Witch of the West.
But if we do that, we'll have to kill her to get it.
Bring me her broomstick...
...and I'll grant your requests.
Now go!
But what if she kills us first?
I said go!
"I'd turn back if I were you. "
I believe there's spooks around here.
That's ridiculous!
Spooks. That's silly.
Don't you believe in spooks?
No. Why, only... Oh!
Are you all right?
I do believe in spooks.
I do, I do, I do, I do.
I do believe in spooks.
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do!
You'll believe in more than that before I'm finished with you.
Take your army and bring me that girl and her dog.
Do what you like with the others, but I want her alive and unharmed.
They'll give you no trouble.
I promise you that.
I've sent a little insect on ahead to take the fight out of them.
Take special care of those slippers.
I want those most of all.
Now, fly! Fly!
Bring me that girl and her slippers!
Fly! Fly! Fly!
Help! Help!
Go away now!
Toto! Toto! Help!
Help! Help! Help!
What happened to you?
They tore my legs off and threw them over there!
Then they took my chest and threw it over there!
That's you all over.
They sure knocked the stuffings out of you.
Don't stand there. Put me together.
We've got to find Dorothy!
Now, let's see...
What a nice little dog.
And you, my dear.
What an unexpected pleasure.
It's so kind of you to visit me in my loneliness.
What are you gonna do with my dog?
Give him back to me!
All in good time, my little pretty.
- All in good time.
- Please give me back my dog.
Certainly, certainly...
...when you give me those slippers.
- But the Good Witch told me not to.
- Very well.
Throw that basket in the river and drown him.
No! Here. You can have your old slippers, but give me back Toto!
That's a good little girl.
I knew you'd see reason!
I'm sorry! I didn't do it.
Can I still have my dog?
No! Fool that I am,
I should have remembered...
...those slippers will never come off...
...as long as you're alive.
But that's not what's worrying me.
It's how to do it.
These things must be done delicately...
...or you hurt the spell.
Run, Toto, run!
Catch him, you fool!
Run, Toto, run!
Run, Toto, run!
He got away! He got away!
Which is more than you will!
Drat, you and your dog!
You've been more trouble to me than you're worth.
But it'll soon be over now!
Do you see that?
That's how much longer you've got to be alive.
And it isn't long, my pretty.
It isn't long!
I can't wait forever to get those shoes!
I'm frightened.
I'm frightened, Auntie Em!
I'm frightened.
Dorothy! Dorothy!
Where are you?
It's me. It's Auntie Em.
We're trying to find you.
Where are you?
I'm here in Oz, Auntie Em.
I'm locked up in the Witch's castle...
...and I'm trying to get home to you,
Auntie Em!
Oh, Auntie Em, don't go away!
I'm frightened!
Come back! Come back!
"Auntie Em, Auntie Em! Come back!"
I'll give you Auntie Em, my pretty!
Look! There's Toto.
Where'd he come from?
Why, don't you see?
He's come to take us to Dorothy.
Come on, fellas!
I hope my strength holds out.
I hope your tail holds out.
What's that? What's that?
That's the castle of the Wicked Witch.
- Dorothy's in that awful place?
- I hate to think of her in there.
- We've got to get her out.
- Don't cry now.
We haven't got the oilcan, and you've been squeaking enough as it is.
Who's them? Who's them?
- I've got a plan how to get in there.
- Fine. He's got a plan.
- And you're gonna lead us.
- Yeah.
- Me?
- Yes, you.
- I gotta get her out of there?
- That's right.
All right, I'll go in there for Dorothy.
Wicked Witch or no Wicked Witch...
...guards or no guards,
I'll tear them apart.
I may not come out alive, but I'm going in there.
- There's only one thing I want you to do.
- What's that?
Talk me out of it.
- No, you don't!
- Oh, no.
- Now, wait a minute.
Up!
Shh!
Shh! Shh!
Come on, I've got another idea.
Do you think it would be polite, dropping in like this?
- Where do we go now?
- Yeah.
There!
Wait! We better make sure.
Dorothy, are you in there?
It's us!
- Yes!
It's me! She's locked me in!
We gotta get her out! Open the door!
Oh, hurry! Please hurry!
The hourglass is almost empty!
Stand back!
Oh, Toto! Toto! Oh, Lion!
I knew you'd come!
I knew you would!
Hurry, we've got no time to lose!
Going so soon?
I wouldn't hear of it.
Why, my little party's just beginning.
Trapped. Trapped like mice... rats.
That's right.
Don't hurt them right away.
We'll let them think about it a little first.
Seize them! Seize them!
Stop them, you fools!
Seize them! Seize them!
There they go! Now we've got them!
Half of you go this way, half of you go that way.
Hurry! Hurry!
Where do we go now?
This way. Come on!
Back! Back!
Well!
Ring-around the rosie, a pocket full of spears!
Thought you'd be pretty foxy, didn't you?
The last to go will see the first three go before her.
And her mangy little dog too!
How about a little fire, Scarecrow?
Help! I'm burning! I'm burning!
It's burning! Help!
Don't throw that water!
You cursed brat!
Look what you've done!
I'm melting! Melting!
Oh, what a world! What a world!
Who would've thought a good little girl like you...
...could destroy my beautiful wickedness?
Look out! Look out!
I'm going.
She's dead. You've killed her.
I didn't mean to kill her.
Really, I didn't.
It's just that he was on fire.
Hail to Dorothy!
The Wicked Witch is dead!
Hail! Hail to Dorothy!
The Wicked Witch is dead!
The broom.
- May we have it?
- Please. And take it with you.
Oh, thank you so much!
Now we can go tell the Wizard the Wicked Witch is dead!
The Wicked Witch is dead!
Can I believe my eyes?
Why have you come back?
Please, sir. We've done what you told us.
We've brought you the broomstick of the Wicked Witch of the West.
We melted her.
Ah, you liquidated her, eh?
- Very resourceful.
- Yes, sir.
So we'd like you to keep your promise to us, if you please, sir.
Not so fast. Not so fast!
I'll have to give the matter a little thought.
Go away and come back tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
Oh, but I wanna go home now!
- You've had plenty of time already.
- Yeah.
Do not arouse the wrath of the great and powerful Oz!
I said come back tomorrow!
If you were really great and powerful, you'd keep your promises.
Do you presume to criticize the great Oz?
You ungrateful creatures!
Think yourselves lucky that I'm giving you audience tomorrow...
...instead of 20 years from now!
Oh!
The great Oz has spoken! Oh!
Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain.
The great and...
Oz has spoken.
Who are you?
I am the great and powerful
Wizard of Oz.
You are? I don't believe you.
I'm afraid it's true.
There's no other Wizard except me.
- You humbug!
- Yeah.
Yes, that's exactly so. I'm a humbug.
You're a very bad man!
Oh, no, my dear. I'm a very good man.
I'm just a very bad wizard.
What about the heart you promised Tin Man?
And the courage you promised
Cowardly Lion?
- And Scarecrow's brain?
- And Scarecrow's brain?
Why, anybody can have a brain.
That's a very mediocre commodity.
Every pusillanimous creature that crawls on the earth...
...or slinks through slimy seas has a brain.
Back where I come from, we have universities...
...seats of great learning, where men go to become great thinkers.
They think deep thoughts, and with no more brains than you have.
But they have one thing you haven't got. A diploma.
Therefore, by virtue of the authority vested in me...
...by the Universitatus Committeeatum
E Pluribus Unum...
...I hereby confer upon you...
...the honorary degree of Th. D.
- Th. D.?
That's Doctor of Thinkology.
The sum of the square roots of two sides of an isosceles triangle...
...is equal to the square root of the remaining side.
Oh, joy! Rapture!
I've got a brain!
- How can I thank you enough?
- Well, you can't.
As for you, my fine friend, you're a victim of disorganized thinking.
You are under the delusion that because you run away from danger...
...you have no courage.
You're confusing courage with wisdom.
Back where I come from, we have men who are called "heroes. "
Once a year, they take their fortitude out of mothballs...
...and parade it down the main street.
And they have no more courage than you have.
But they have one thing that you haven't got. A medal.
Therefore...
...for meritorious conduct, extraordinary valor...
...conspicuous bravery against wicked witches...
...I award you the Triple Cross.
You are now a member of the Legion of Courage.
Shucks, folks, I'm speechless.
As for you, my galvanized friend, you want a heart.
You don't know how lucky you are not to have one.
Hearts will never be practical until they can be made unbreakable.
But I still want one.
Back where I come from, there are men who do nothing all day but good deeds.
They are called phil...
Good-deed-doers. And their hearts are no bigger than yours.
But they have one thing you haven't got. A testimonial.
Therefore, in consideration of your kindness...
...I take pleasure at this time in presenting you...
...with a small token of our esteem and affection.
And remember, my sentimental friend...
...that a heart is not judged by how much you love...
...but by how much you are loved by others.
Ah.
Oh! It ticks!
Listen! Look, it ticks!
Read what my medal says. "Courage. "
Ain't it the truth!
Ain't it the truth!
Oh, they're all wonderful.
Hey, what about Dorothy?
Yes, how about Dorothy?
- Yeah. Dorothy next.
I don't think there's anything in that black bag for me.
You force me into a cataclysmic decision.
The only way to get Dorothy to Kansas is for me to take her myself.
Oh, will you? Could you? Oh!
But are you clever enough to manage it?
Child, you cut me to the quick!
I'm an old Kansas man myself...
...born and bred in the western wilderness...
...premier balloonist par excellence to the
Miracle Wonderland Carnival Company.
Until one day, while performing feats of stratospheric skill...
...never before attempted by civilized man...
...an unfortunate phenomena occurred.
The balloon failed to return to the fair.
- It did?
- Weren't you frightened?
You are talking to a man who has laughed in the face of death...
...sneered at doom and chuckled at catastrophe. I was petrified.
Suddenly the wind changed...
...and the balloon floated down into this noble city...
...where I was instantly acclaimed Oz, the first wizard deluxe!
Times being what they were,
I accepted the job...
...retaining my balloon against the advent of a quick getaway.
And in that balloon, dear Dorothy...
...you and I will return to the land of E Pluribus Unum.
My friends. I mean, my friends!
This is positively the finest exhibition ever to be shown...
...be that as it may.
I, your Wizard per ardua ad alta...
...am about to embark upon a hazardous...
...and technically unexplainable journey...
...into the outer stratosphere!
To confer, converse...
...and otherwise hobnob with my brother wizards.
And I hereby decree that until what time...
...if any, that I return...
...the Scarecrow, by virtue of his highly superior brains...
...shall rule in my stead...
...assisted by the Tin Man, by virtue of his magnificent heart...
...and the Lion, by virtue of his courage.
Obey them as you would me.
Thank you.
Oh, Toto! Come back! Toto!
Don't go without me.
I'll be right back.
Stop that dog!
This is a highly irregular procedure.
This is absolutely unprecedented!
- Ruined my exit!
Come back! Come back!
Don't go without me!
Please come back!
I can't come back!
I don't know how it works!
Goodbye, folks!
Goodbye!
Oh, now I'll never get home.
Stay with us then, Dorothy.
We all love you.
We don't want you to go.
That's very kind of you...
...but this could never be like Kansas.
Auntie Em must have stopped wondering what happened to me by now.
Oh, Scarecrow, what am I going to do?
Look!
Here's someone who can help you!
- Will you help me? Can you help me?
- You don't need help any longer.
You've always had the power to go back to Kansas.
- I have?
- Then why didn't you tell her before?
Because she wouldn't have believed me.
She had to learn it for herself.
What have you learned, Dorothy?
Well...
I think that it...
...that it wasn't enough just to want to see Uncle Henry and Auntie Em.
And it's that if I ever go looking for my heart's desire again...
...I won't look any further than my own back yard...
...because if it isn't there...
...I never really lost it to begin with.
Is that right?
That's all it is.
But that's so easy!
I should've thought of it for you.
- I should've felt it in my heart.
- She had to find it out for herself.
Now those magic slippers will take you home in two seconds.
- Toto too?
- Toto too.
- Now?
- Whenever you wish.
Oh, dear.
That's too wonderful to be true!
Oh, it's...
It's gonna be so hard to say goodbye.
I love you all too.
Goodbye, Tin Man.
Oh, don't cry.
You'll rust so dreadfully.
Here. Here's your oilcan.
- Goodbye.
- Now I know I've got a heart...
...because it's breaking.
Goodbye, Lion.
I know it isn't right...
...but I'm gonna miss the way you used to holler for help...
...before you found your courage.
I would never have found it if it hadn't been for you.
I think I'll miss you most of all.
- Are you ready now?
- Yes.
Say goodbye, Toto.
- Yes, I'm ready now.
- Then close your eyes...
...and tap your heels together three times...
...and think to yourself:
"There's no place like home.
There's no place like home. "
There's no place like home.
Wake up, honey.
- There's no place like home.
There's no place like home.
There's no...
Dorothy, dear. It's Aunt Em, darling.
Oh, Auntie Em, it's you!
- Yes, darling.
Hello there! Anybody home?
I dropped by because I heard the little girl got caught in the big...
- Well, she seems all right now.
- She got quite a bump on the head.
We kind of thought she was gonna leave us.
But I did leave you.
That's just the trouble.
And I tried to get back for days!
There, there, lie quiet now.
- You just had a bad dream.
- Sure.
Remember me...
...your old pal, Hunk?
And me, Hickory?
You couldn't forget my face, could you?
No. But it wasn't a dream.
It was a place.
And you and you and you...
...and you were there.
But you couldn't have been, could you?
We dream lots of silly things when we...
No, Aunt Em, this was a real, truly live place.
And I remember that some of it wasn't very nice...
...but most of it was beautiful.
But just the same, all I kept saying to everybody was, "I want to go home!"
And they sent me home.
Doesn't anybody believe me?
Of course we believe you, Dorothy.
But anyway, Toto, we're home!
Home! And this is my room...
...and you're all here.
And I'm not going to leave here ever, ever again...
...because I love you all.
And oh, Auntie Em...
...there's no place like home!

More, Betsy! More!
Now this concludes our little entertainment... and I'm sure we've all enjoyed it immensely.
I'm sorry to say... or perhaps,
I really shouldn't say sorry... but we won't have the pleasure of hearing Betsy sing for us again here.
Betsy's leaving us today.
Mr. Shea, who was a dear friend of her parents... has come to take her to live with him in New York.
I'm sure she has everybody's good wishes for happiness... in her new home.
- Is that me?
- I guess it is.
Gee. I'm certainly a big surprise to myself!
I'll get your coat and hat.
Oh, you look beautiful, Betsy!
- It's just splendid, isn't it?
- Mm-hmm.
I... I hope someday you'll all have pretty dresses too.
Betsy. We'll have to hurry now, dear.
I've still got to wrap all those toys
Mr. Shea's been bringing you.
Couldn't I leave them here,
Miss Hutchins?
Mmm, Mr. Shea might not like it.
He won't care. Please, Miss Hutchins,
I'd much rather leave them here.
Just give them to... oh, everybody.
Oh, that's sweet of you, dear.
Say thanks to Betsy, girls.
Thank you, Betsy.
Now say good-bye to everybody, and we'll hurry along.
- Good-bye Carol.
- Bye, Betsy.
- Good-bye, Jean.
- Good-bye, Betsy.
- Bye, Sheila.
- Good-bye, Betsy.
- Good-bye, Marilyn.
- Good-bye, Betsy.
- Good-bye, Mary.
- Good-bye, Betsy.
Good-bye, Rosalie.
What's the matter?
Don't you want to say good-bye to me?
- No!
- Why, Rosalie. I'm surprised.
Now be a nice girl.
Say good-bye to Betsy.
No! I don't want to say good-bye.
- Why not?
- 'Cause...
Because I don't want
Betsy to go.
Betsy.! Betsy!
Betsy!
Where's that button?

Hotel Variety.
The Three Dancing Baby Dolls?
They don't live here anymore.
I don't know. I reckon they retired on their social security.
- You're welcome.
- Hi, Pop!
Hello, Sam.
Flossie, see if you can locate Betsy.
It's time she was in bed.
- Hello? Is Betsy up there?
- Any mail for me, Pop?
- You see...
- No, no mail for you, Sam.
Any mail for his fiddle?
Yeah, from its beau.
Those are the kind of gags that killed vaudeville.
- Hello, Betsy.
- Hello. Hello.
Upstage. Rehearse in the theater.
- Hello, angel.
- Hello.
- Where have you been?
- Oh, just visiting.
Visiting, when you should have been in bed? Have you done your homework?
Oh, yes.
Here's my arithmetic.
- Who helped you with these problems?
- Mr. Burdini, the magician.
Hmm. Six goes into 18 five times?
Seven goes into 21 four times?
He's a magician, all right.
Oh, he's awful clever.
He's been teaching me new tricks.
May I have my key, please?
- Is that some of your ventriloquism?
- That wasn't me.
Is there any mail for us?
Oh, hello.
It's Mr. and Mrs. Brasno.
- There you are.
- Thank you.
- It's from our son.
- He's in college.
- Look, Ma. Butch made the football team.
- Oh. Look.
"Dearest Mom and Pop...
"just a line or two.
"Hope you and Mom are well and have found something to do.
"I am getting along fine with my studies.
My goodness!
As you can see,
I'm on the squad.''
- Hello, George, Ollie!
Hiya, folks! Hello, Bets!
- Hello, Mike.
- Is there anything for us, Mike?
- Buffalo, next week.
One act for a smoker in a hurry.
How about you?
Sorry, Mr. Brody.
I'm all booked up tonight.
On the slumber time, huh? I get it.
- Who do ya suggest, Pop?
- Why, let me see...
- Better see who owes the most rent.
- Right.
Well, there's Martin and Martin, nine weeks.
Sullivan and Haley, six weeks.
Jimmy Clayton and his jazz band, it's 12 weeks.
- How about them?
- They're a knockout.
- All right, if you say so.
- Get Jimmy Clayton on the telephone.
I raise a thousand bucks.
- I think the phone's ringing.
- Don't change the subject.
I call you.
What you got?
- What do you got?
- Well, I...
I just got a little pair of threes.
And I thought you was bluffing.
Nuts to me, you get it?
Did you hang up your dress?
I hung up my dress, put away my shoes, brushed my teeth...
- washed my neck, face, hands and ears.
- Nice work.
I used to have curls all over my head once.
- Oh, that must've been lovely.
- Yes, but they were lots of trouble.
Now, don't you sit up and listen to that music.
You just shut your eyes and go right to sleep.
I'll shut my eyes, but it'll probably come in through my ears.
Hiya, Butch!
Willoughby!
- Willoughby.
- Yes, Sister?
Close that window.
Hand me the telephone book.
Yes, Sister.
You seem to be enjoying that horrible racket.
Hmm?
Well, I... I was carried away for the moment.
Hmm.
Yes, Miss Wendling, this is
Mr. Shea's daughter. My father...
I'm awfully sorry. The boys are rehearsing, but I'd be glad to...
I'm tired of warning you people.
I won't have my nights disturbed by a lot of noisy riffraff.
I won't put up with it any longer.
I'm sorry, Miss Wendling.
I'll go right up and...
- What's the matter?
- She called us a lot of riffraff.
- Who?
- Our landlady.
- I didn't know we had one.
- Well, if you ever see a pumpkin... in one of the windows next door and it isn't Halloween, that's our landlady.
Ugh!
I can't look out my window without seeing a lot of acrobats, jugglers... midgets and actors.
How much rent does the Hotel Variety owe?
$2,500 past due since the 12th.
Write a letter... to what's-his-name... Shea.
- Sarah!
- Ah!
Tell him unless his rent is paid within five days, in full, out he goes.
- Come on. In you go.
- Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy.
I've got to go up there and see about stopping that music.
- Oh, no. I like it.
- You do?
- Yes, especially that song.
- Well, it is a pretty song.
- Know why I like it?
- No. Why?
The words are just the way
I feel about you and Pop.
No fooling?
Lots of times I wanted to thank you, oh, ever so much.
Well, you don't have to, darling.
I'm afraid I can't
'cause...
# ow can I thank you#
#How do I start#
#The words are somewhere#
#Around my heart#
#If I could say#
#In a word or two#
#How much it means#
#To be loved by you#
#Then I could thank you#
# For all you've done #
#But I don't know what#
#To do#
#What can you say#
#When a dream comes true#
# How can I ever#
#Thank you#
Mmm. Don't you try to, dear.
Now you just close your eyes and go right to sleep.
- Happy dreams.
- Thanks.
- Good night, darling.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
You old pumpkin!
We've got to stick together.
It's one for all, and divided we fall.
The wolf is at the door, and the handwriting is on the wall.
- Pop's always been regular with us.
- He sure has.
So what does it get him?
A shady nook behind the eight ball.
We got to go out and hock everything we own.
Jewelry, trunks, instruments, props, everything.
We've got our sorority pins.
Get all the dough you can and give it to Pop.
If it wasn't for Pop, we'd all have barnacles on our hips... from sleeping on park benches.
And that's what'll happen if that old battle-ax next door... puts him out of the hotel.
It's up to us to raise some dough.
Jimmy, here's my watch.
What about that stickpin?
Oh-Oh, wait, wait!
You're choking me!
My goodness, don't pull it so hard.
I'll give it to you.
- Yes?
- May I see Miss Sarah Wendling, please?
- She's not at home.
- When will she be back?
I don't know.
If you're looking for Miss Wendling, she isn't home.
- Is that so?
- I'm waiting for her too.
- You are?
- Oh, yes, on important business.
Well, uh, maybe if it's very important,
I might put in a good word for you.
- Do you know Miss Wendling?
- Oh, yes, very well.
- She's my aunt.
- She is? Well, say... would you please give her this... and tell her it's on account for the rent of the hotel?
- The hotel? What hotel?
- Next door.
And will you please ask her to wait until Pop can pay her the rest?
Well, uh... uh, whom shall I say this is from?
Betsy. No, from Pop...
Mr. Shea.
Well, maybe it'd be a better idea... if you came inside and told her yourself.
But she's not in.
He said so.
Oh, he did?
I have an idea he's been imagining things.
- Miss Wendling is in, isn't she, Simmons?
- She's in the library, sir.
Oh!
Oh.
Stand in the corner.
Go on. Hide your face.
You big fibber!
That'll be all,
Simmons.
Why, if anyone did a thing like that at the orphanage... they'd have to stand in the corner for an hour.
At the orphanage?
Mm-hmm. I used to be an orphan before Pop adopted me.
Well, now that's a coincidence.
You know, I used to be an orphan myself.
Too bad we weren't orphans at the same time.
- We could've had lots of fun together.
- I'll bet we could.
- Will you excuse me a minute?
- Mm-hmm.
Say, that's cute.
Where'd you learn that?
- Jimmy and the Bandits.
- The what?
- The jazz band.
- Oh. Look at this.
That's good too.
Where'd you learn that?
At Harvard. You've heard of the Hasty Pudding club?
Mm-mmm. But I'll bet it tastes good.
- We dancers have got to stick together.
- Absolutely.
#We should be together#
#Like the walls and ceiling#
#Like a door and doorknob#
#Like the hat on your knob#
#Like butler goes with doorbell#
#Keyhole with key#
#I think we'll get by#
#If you'll stick with me#
#We should be together #
#Like the frame and picture#
#Like shoes and stockings#
#Like the clock's tick-tockings#
- #Like tap and toe like high and low#
- #Stop and go, honey#
- #You're a perfect lady#
- #You're a regular guy#
Oh, thanks.
#We should be together you and I#
- #You're a cup of coffee#
- Ho, ho!
#You're a peachy pie#
#We should be together you and I#
- Roger, what's going on?
- Oh, g... good morning, Aunt Sarah.
Betsy, this is Miss Wendling, and this is Uncle Willoughby.
How do you do,
Miss Wendling?
- How do you do, Mr. Uncle Willoughby?
- Charmed, I'm sure.
What nonsense are you up to?
This isn't nonsense.
This is high finance.
Hear the pretty music?
This young lady wants to give you money to pay the rent.
- Oh, nonsense!
- Come on, Betsy.
- So you've gone in for social service?
- Oh, not exactly, Aunt Sarah.
I just met an acquaintance here.
There's almost five dollars in there.
I'm sure Pop'll have the rest of it for you very soon.
- Bless my soul!
- Keep your soul out of this.
- You'll please get rid of this child.
- But, Aunt Sarah...
If those people think they can play on my sympathy like this... they're greatly mistaken.
I'll have my rent... all of it... or out they go.
Please, Miss Wendling.
Please don't put Pop out of the hotel.
He and Barbara and Jimmy and everybody, they'll have no place to live.
That's their affair, not mine.
But, Aunt Sarah, aren't you being a little bit hard?
- Yes, Sarah, I think...
- Think to yourself.
The place is an infernal nuisance, full of worthless, disreputable actors.
They are not disputable!
They're very good actors.
- Thank you.
- Roger.
Just charge it to my share of the estate.
Simmons.
You will get rid of this child.
You don't need to get rid of me.
I can go.
Just a moment, Betsy.
Aunt Sarah, I don't wish to seem impertinent... but after all, I do have a third interest in the hotel.
As long as I have charge of the Wendling estate...
I'll handle it in my own way.
Simmons, see this child to the door. Stand aside.
Uh, that'll be all, Simmons.
I'll see the young lady home.
- Come on, Betsy.
- Wait. Shh. Just a minute.
- Here, take these.
- Thanks, Uncle Willoughby.
- Simmons, get my hat and coat, please.
- Very good, sir.
Say, I may want to see you about this a little later.
No, no, no. I don't want to be involved, but I'll be at the club.
Come, come, young lady.
Cheer up, darling. Cheer up.
I guess I'm not a very good businesswoman.
Oh, that's great. Then you won't grow up to be like my Aunt Sarah.
- Shh.
- Come on, honey.
Thank you, Simmons.
See you later, Uncle Willoughby.
- Good-bye, Mr. Uncle Willoughby.
- Bye-bye, Betsy.
And if you say one word to my sister about those cookies...
I'll smack you right in the kisser.
Very good, sir.
You know you shouldn't have gone over there without permission.
- I was only trying to help, Pop.
- I'm glad she did.
I'd never have known that this place existed. It's all very interesting.
Next door, we hardly realize we're so close to anything so, uh... so different.
I suppose you feel like a feudal lord visiting the tenants on his estate.
I bet you'd look grand all dressed up like a knight on a big white horse.
Riding back to his castle for safety?
No. Rescuing the fairy princess.
I mean, two fairy princesses.
Mr. Wendling, I couldn't possibly raise the money in five days.
Well, as a matter of fact,
I was going to make a suggestion... before your daughter so graciously knighted me.
I was going to suggest that I could lend you the 2,500. My aunt needn't know.
You'd lend... Why...
Thanks a million.
Thanks two million... one from me.
I'm afraid we can't accept your generous offer.
- Why not, Barbara?
- Because I don't know how we could pay it back.
And we're not going to be at the mercy of any spiteful old moneybag... who calls us a lot of riffraff.
I'm sorry, Mr. Shea. I, uh...
So am I. You see, I just couldn't accept your kind offer now.
- I understand.
- Come, Betsy. It's time for your lunch.
Pop? Couldn't Mr. Wendling stay and have lunch with me?
Well, I'm afraid...
As a matter of fact, I was going to invite you to lunch... but I guess the Wendlings are sort of social outcasts around here now.
- Please let me go with him.
- I wish you would.
Please, Pop. I'm old enough to go out with a nice young man.
- All right.
- It's a date.
Barbara's awful smart.
She reads great big books when she's not helping Pop at the hotel.
- Oh, she does?
- Yes.
She told me she's studying how not to be an actress.
Oh. I see.
Well, uh, does she have many boyfriends?
Oh, yes, lots of them.
There's Ole, the Four Martins,
Jimmy and his Jazz Bandits...
No, no. I mean, is there anybody that takes her out to dinner, lunch...
- You know, a sweetheart?
- Oh.
No. I guess she's just an old maid, like I was till you came along.
Say, are you trying to tell me that you like me?
Mm-hmm.
#I can't show how much I love you#
#In this little space
I've got#
#I don't know how much
I love you#
#But it's an enormous lot#
#If all the world were paper#
#And all the seas were ink#
#I'd write a great big note to you#
#And tell you what I think#
#I'd say
I love you dearly#
#In letters three miles high#
#And sign it yours sincerely#
#Cross my heart and hope to die#
#If all the stars were diamonds#
#In golden skies above#
#They wouldn't be worth that without your love#
#I'd like to write
I love you#
#So big that you would blink#
#If all the world were paper#
#Yes, and all the seas were ink#
What are all those mummies sitting in there for?
Mummies?
Those aren't mummies, Betsy...
Those are millionaires.
They spent all their lives trying to make a million dollars... and now they sit there wondering why.
- Hello, old-timer!
- Shh!
- Is, uh, Mr. Wendling in?
- He's in the Grill, sir.
Oh, he's in the Grill.
#I love you as I never#
#Loved before #
#Since first I met you on the village green#
#The village green#
#Come to me ere my dream#
#Of love#
#Is o'er#
- #I love you...
- mJim, wait a minute. That's terrible!
Oh, just a minute, gentlemen.
Whoa, just a moment now.
- I was standing right here.
Someone was a little bit sour.
- It was you.
What? Well, what do you know about music?
Well, of all the impertinence.
You were off-key.
That part goes like this.
#I love you as I loved you#
#When you were sweet#
- That's just the way I did it.
- Oh, no!
- I did!
- No. No.
- Let's try it again.
- All right, you take it.
# I love you as I loved you #
- #When you were sweet#
- # Sweet#
#When you were sweet #
#Sixteen#
That's the best you've ever done!
Now we got it.
Let's hold it.
- The youngster knows her stuff, don't she?
- She sure does.
Begging your pardon, gentlemen.
So sorry, but, uh, this noise...
- Noise?
- What are you talking about?
We've been having complaints.
The other club members...
Just when we're getting hot!
What's this country coming to if a man can't sing in his club?
Isn't there someplace we can rehearse without being disturbed?
- I know a place!
- Yeah? Where?
- A hotel!
- Say, that's a swell idea.
No, it won't work. We've been thrown out of the finest hotels in New York...
- The Waldorf-Astoria and St. Regis.
- That's right.
Well, you'll never be thrown out of this one.
This one is just made-to-order for you.
Just say you're a quartet, and you can sing all you want.
Really? Where is this place?
You mean...
She's right! Come on, boys!
A haven at last!
Last one out's an old maid!
- Well, I'm not gonna be any old maid!
- Come on, Betsy. Hurry up!
Eight bucks from the Tristate Trio... five from Daugherty, and five from Conklin and Scully.
- How much are we short?
- About 2,100.
The national debt.
I thought I was bringing home the bacon.
And you laid an egg.
That's right. Bite the hand that feeds the kitty.
Thanks just the same.
You're a great guy, Jimmy.
That goes for me too, bubble brain.
Is that straight from the balcony, Juliet?
It's my streamlined personality.
- I guess I'm not as bad as I look, huh?
- You couldn't be!
That's done it! From now on when you talk to me... start the conversation with good-bye.
- This way, gentlemen.
- Oh, Pop!
Hurry, Pop.
We brought you some new guests.
These gentlemen were looking for a hotel... so Betsy suggested that they come over here.
- Um, professionals?
- Ooh, yes. They're a quartet.
Yes. This is the well-known
Hot and Happy Four.
Yes! The Hop and Hat... the Hot and Happy Four.
- Where have you boys been playing?
- Ooh, hotels, clubs... churches and places.
Now, would you prefer single rooms or a suite?
- They want the best in the house, don't you?
- Yes! Certainly!
There's a nice, big suite on the fourth floor with four beds and a green carpet.
Green? My favorite color.
We'll take that.
Well, that's pretty high:
$40 a week.
That's not too steep for these gentlemen, is it?
No! Not at all!
That's fine.
Uh... Uh...
- Where is your baggage?
- Huh?
Baggage? Oh, baggage!
Oh, well... well...
Well, we could get some if you... if it's necessary.
Oh, it's very necessary. 'Cause guests without baggage have to pay in advance.
- Isn't that right, Pop?
- It's a rule of the house.
Oh, that's quite all right.
How much will you want in advance?
- Well...
- Uh, suppose we let Betsy decide that.
Well, let's see.
I think about, well, 10 years.
- No. Suppose we make it one year?
- Oh, no, no. That's too much.
No. I'm sure these gentlemen would rather pay one year in advance.
- Wouldn't you?
- Yes, sir. Certainly.
Then they wouldn't have to worry about the rent, and neither would you.
There you are, sir.
Fifty-two times 40 is 2,008.
Gee! You're awful good in arithmetic.
That's fine.
Uh, 426.
I'll take them up.
Follow me, gentlemen.
#Mi, mi, mi, mi, mi, mi, mi, mi...#
Say, how are the acoustics here?
Oh, we don't have any.
We use Flit.
She uses Flit!
Come on.
I hope it don't bounce.
Pop, here's
25 bucks more.
I got it, Jimmy.
I got the 2,500.
What? And we just made the supreme sacrifice! Look!
- What happened?
- We done a striptease in a pawnshop.
Georgie. Georgie, where are you?
Your watch!
Marco, your dummy!
Take your drums away, Jerry!
Take them away!
Here's the cello for Heinie!
Here's your piccolo.
Here you are, Syd. Take it away.
The twins.
- Your paternity pins.
- Thanks, Jimmy.
- Ole. Your waker-upper.
- Oh, thank you, Jimmy.
Oh, no, no, no!
P-Please don't do that.
Jimmy, how you get them out the hock?
Ask me no questions.
- Mr. Wendling?
- Oh, hello. You still mad?
How could I be after all you've done for us? May I say thank you?
Well, sure, if you'll omit the ''mister'' and make it plain ''Roger.''
- Thank you, Roger.
- That's okay.
Barbara, Betsy wants you upstairs to help her with her reading lesson.
Tell her I'll be right up.
Could I go along?
I used to be very good at reading.
- Well, Betsy's in the third grade.
- Third grade? That high?
- Well, maybe I could learn something.
- Come on!
'''Run for your life,' said the little princess. 'I am the cap... “Cap...”
- Now slowly. What's this?
- “Tive.” “Captive.” Oh, yeah.
“I am the captive of a wicked, old sor...”
“Sor...” “Sorce...”
Sorceress.
You mustn't tell her.
Let her figure the words out herself.
“I'm not afraid”' said the brave young prince.
'I have come to rescue you and take you to my castle.”
I like him.
''But you are in great pearl...”
Peril.
That means danger.
Then why doesn't it say “danger”?
All right.
Skip it.
“Suddenly there was a great roar behind him.
“It was the wicked old 'sore-sorce-ess' riding on her broom.
“On her shoulder was a dodo bird... and the dodo bird was whispering in her ear...”
- This is Winchell's daily chatter.
- Mmm.
''That expensive speed buggy parked daily in front of Pop Shea's Hotel Variety...
“belongs to the Roger Wending... and the reason is Pop's lovely daughter, Barbara.”
I thought it my duty to inform you, Miss Wendling.
So that's why he hasn't been dining at home.
Cancel my reservations.
I'll take a later train to Newport.
I'll put a stop to all this right now.
Look, I want to show you here.
Now look. Up here's the little boy.
The little boy comes down here.
And he's got a dog, but the dog won't come downstairs.
The little boy goes upstairs, and he chucks the dog downstairs.
Isn’t that good?
So you don't like that.
Look, come here. I show you another.
Come, come. Isn't there anyone looking after this place?
No! You all can't call South Brooklyn.
It's 10 cents in advance.
Come, come.
With or without bath?
I don't want a bath...
I mean a room.
I want to talk to that man
Shea's daughter.
She's upstairs right now.
Is there anything I can do?
There is... Have her come downstairs at once.
Park yourself over there, and I'll see if I can get her.
You got a cigarette, grandma?
- No, and I'm not your grandmother.
- It's okay by me, toots.
Too...
What a face! What a face!
- What?
- Gordon's play.
You'd be great for the old witch.
Oh, I would.
Well, don't blow that smoke in my face.
Come on, Oscar.
We're going up.
Hello, Aunt Sarah.
It's the old pumpkin.
So this is where you've been wasting your time.
Aunt Sarah, please. Please.
Uh, Barbara, Betsy.
I'd like you to meet my aunt.
- This is Miss Shea and Miss Betsy Shea.
Miss Wendling.
- How do you do?
Young lady, I've come here to tell you... that I want you to let this nephew of mine alone.
You let him pay your rent, didn't you?
- Aunt Sarah!
- I don't have to listen to this.
Aunt Sarah, that was uncalled for, unkind and untrue.
Uncle Roger didn't give us any money.
We got it from... from someone else.
Oh, so it's Uncle Roger now.
- Is thi...- this woman your mother?
- Practically.
- Betsy is Mr. Shea's adopted child.
- Adopted her?
So they brought her to this wholesome atmosphere. Nice place for a child.
Why, she's using her as a decoy, and you haven't sense enough to realize it.
Aunt Sarah, you don't know what you're saying!
Roger, I want you to get out of here and stay out.
- You forget that I am over 21.
- You forget I control your finances.
I won't allow any Broadway gold digger to get your money if I can help it.
Stand aside.
Did she mean me?
No, I don't think so, Betsy.
I don't know what she's talking about... but I'll bet she's going to make trouble for us.
- Yes, I'm ringing him, mister.
- Flossie?
Just a minute.
Flossie, there's something
I've been wanting to ask you.
- Yes?
- A man gets lonesome knocking... around with no one to talk to but a five-piece orchestra...
- and living in a...
- Hotel Variety.
That's right.
I was wondering, if I asked a certain girl to marry me...
- what would she say?
- You're on a busy line, stupid.
- Go ahead.
- I withdraw the question.
- I want to see Mr. Shea. Is he around?
- Somebody calling me?
The law.
Yes, sir.
What can I do for you?
- What's this?
- What's the matter, Pop?
It's for Betsy.
Now, if you could come around tomorrow morning...
Sorry. I don't like this any more than you.
But I got to take her back tonight.
Look here, Officer, you can't take Betsy back to the orphan asylum.
You know why? 'Cause Betsy isn’t here.
She's down south in dear old Dixie.
Sure. Visiting with my folks.
#I wish I was in Dixie#
#Away, away#
- Hey, are you crazy?
- Yeah. No!
You see, we don't want to lose Betsy.
That's why I lied to you.
She's up in her room.
- What's the number?
I'll go and get her.
- But where are we going to take her?
- Over to my house.
Your house? Impossible.
I don't think Miss Wendling likes me very well.
She'll never know. She's gone to Newport and won't be back for a month.
I guess they'd never think of looking for her there.
No. Come on, Betsy.
Upsy-daisy.
Hang on tight now.
Hold her, Barbara.
Yeah. I got her.
- There you are.
- Thanks an awful lot.
Will you and Pop and everybody come over to see me?
- You bet we will. Good night, darling.
- Good night.
Come on, Betsy.
- Good night.
- Good night, darling.
Good night.
Good night, darling.
Don't cry, Betsy.
They can't do this to us.
We'll take it up to the Supreme Court, to Washington, to Lincoln.
Officer, take your prisoner.
- I'm sorry, old boy.
- I know. Just doing your duty.
Now run along before I give vent to my emotions.
Say, where are you going with my wife?
- What do you mean, your wife?
- You keep away from my wife... or I'll smack you down to my size.
- But I only did it to help Betsy.
- Ah!
Ah, Georgie, listen to me.
Now don't be sore.
We had to help little Betsy.
What's the matter, darling?
Something wrong?
No, nothing,
Uncle Willoughby.
- Only...
- Only what?
Couldn't I go over to the hotel for just a few minutes?
Oh, no, dear, no. There's been a detective over there every day this week.
Now you just be patient a little longer.
But I was sure someone would come over... especially today.
Why?
What's today?
Come on. Tell me.
It's my birthday.
Your birthday.
My, my.
At the orphanage, they always had a birthday cake for me.
Well, Pop and Barbara have been very busy, but we'll make up for it.
Come on. Let's go downstairs, huh?
You won't miss just one birthday party.
You'll have so many more birthdays and so many more parties.
How about some cookies?
But it just doesn't seem like a birthday at all.
Well, when the detectives stop hanging around in another week or so... maybe we can sneak over to the hotel and have a fine big party.
What do you say?
What do you say?
Oh, dear. I haven't even wished you a happy birthday myself.
Happy birthday!
#Happy birthday to you#
#Happy birthday to you#
# Happy birthday, dear Betsy #
- #Happy birthday to you#
- Speech! Speech!
Congratulations!
Speech! Speech!
How can I thank you?
How do I start?
#The words are somewhere#
#Around my heart#
#If I could say#
# n a word or two#
#How much it means#
#To be loved by you#
#Then I could thank you#
#For all you've done#
#But I don't know what to do#
#What can you say#
#When a dream comes true#
#How can I ever...#
Betsy, darling.
This is no time for tears.
This is your birthday.
On behalf of the hoi polloi gathered here...
I just want to say many happy returns...
- and when do we eat?
- Yeah!
Now!
It's the big parade.
What a joint!
What a joint.
Oh, thank you.
That... that's very nice of you.
- Good blow!
- Happy birthday!
- Cut the cake, Betsy! Cut the cake.
- Yes, come on.
Oh, my goodness.
Get out. Get out, all of you!
You call this hospitality?
I'll take it up with Emily Post.
Where are you taking that child?
Where do you suppose?
I'm taking her home!
- Officer!
- See here, Sarah!
You keep out of this, you Judas.
There's the child you're after.
- You let her alone! Come, Betsy.
- Just a minute.
Don't you hurt Pop!
Don't you dare hurt Pop!
We're not going to hurt anyone.
No need in getting excited.
We've got orders.
No, no!
I want to stay with Pop!
Well, I don't blame you.
You just come along now... and your pop can straighten things out later.
I'm afraid you'll have to go with him, Betsy.
But I don't want to go to the orphanage.
I want to stay with you.
Don't cry, darling.
I'll come and see you, and I'll...
I'll get you out again.
You mean old pumpkin!
Good-bye, Pop.
Good-bye, Betsy.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
I wish you were a man for about five minutes.
Now, Sarah!
You listen to me.
I suppose if Simmons hadn't warned me in time... you probably would have had all these freaks living here.
Well, it was the child's birthday, and people just happened to drop in.
A likely story.
Where's Roger?
- Out with that scheming
Shea girl, I suppose.
- No!
- On the contrary, he's...
- #Happy birthday...#
Well, uh, what kind of a birthday party is this?
You're a little late, aren't you?
Where is everyone?
Where's Betsy?
On her way to the orphan asylum, where she'll be among decent people...
- Come on, Barbara.
- Wait! Young lady!
You can give your father a message:
He's being dispossessed.
- You can't!
- I'm tearing the hotel down.
He's paid his rent.
He's violated his lease by having all sorts of animals.
He'll save himself a lot of trouble by getting right out.
- I'll have something to say about that.
- I'm afraid not... as our attorney will inform you.
Furthermore, I warn you, if you continue your association with this woman...
Continue it? I've been trying to get her to make it permanent.
- Come on, Barbara.
- Roger, wait!
Roger!
Snitcher!
It really isn't so very nice out there.
There's practically no one to play with... just grown-ups.
- And you know how tiresome they can be.
- Yeah.
Didn't you have any fun at all?
Well, it was fun singing with Uncle Willoughby's quartet.
And Jimmy was awfully good to me.
And Pop and... and Barbara.
Aw, come on.
It's not so bad here.
No! It's not!
It's no use crying about it.
Remember what you used to tell us?
- To be optimistic?
- Don't be a grumpy.
And when the road gets bumpy, just smile.
Your troubles can't be as bad as all that.
- And when you're sad as all that...
- Nobody loves you.
#Be optimistic#
#Don't you be a grumpy#
#When the road gets bumpy just smile#
#Smile and be happy#
#Your troubles can't be as bad as all that#
#When you're sad as all that#
#No one loves you#
#Be optimistic#
#Don't you be a mourner#
#Brighten up that corner#
- #And smile#
- #Smile#
- #Smile#
#Don't wear a long face it's never in style#
#Be optimistic and smile#
It's my property and my money just as much as it's hers... and trustee or no trustee, she's got to give it to me.
- What did you ask her?
- I asked her for the hotel and $50,000... just enough to rent a theater and back a show... to give those poor devils a chance to earn a living.
- You'll never get it.
- But I've got to get it!
Mr. Fiske, you're a lawyer.
Tell me. What can I do?
Don't get me in this. I don't want to get tangled with Sarah Wendling.
- Me either.
- I'm just asking for advice.
- I'd rather not ha anything to do with it.
- You can't fight Sarah Wendling.
Very well, gentlemen. Then we'll just allow these people to starve.
People that you all know and admire.
And don't forget, you're just a bunch of ham actors yourselves.
Gentlemen, I'm surprised that you'd sit here... and make beggars and panhandlers out of the same artists... that you used to applaud... to think you'd allow Sarah, just to satisfy some simple whim of hers... to tear the roof from over their heads, to turn them out in the streets
- You can stop her!
- How?
By getting out a temporary injunction restraining her.
You're a part owner.
I'm not advising you!
No, no advice.
But what do I do then?
- Let me alone, Roger!
- There's no harm in telling him.
- Come on, Mr. Fiske.
- Well, you could bring a court action... compelling Sarah to turn over your portion of the estate, including the hotel.
But understand now, it's just a chance... and I don't want to have anything to do with it, no.
Because you're afraid of that bullying sister of mine. Well, I'm not.
- Roger, I'm with you.
- Good for you, Uncle Willoughby.
- And you're going to take the case.
- No!
- Yes!
- No!
Yes! Now hurry up and get out that injunction... or I'll throw you out of the quartet... you, you off-key baritone.
Here's the mail and newspaper, Miss Hutchins.
Oh, thank you, darling.
- Read me the funnies.
- No, after dinner, when you and the other children...
Please, Miss Hutchins.
Please read me the funnies.
All right. Come on.
Oh, look! It's Roger, and that's Miss Wendling.
What does it say?
Please read it to me.
''Trial of Roger Wendling's action against his Aunt Sarah...
''for the petition of the Wendling Estate...
''was begun to day before Judge Hart in surrogate court.
''The young millionaire's action against his eccentric aunt...
“was occasioned by her threat to tear down the Hotel Variety.
This was temporarily prevented by an injunction.”
She wants to tear down the hotel?
- So it seems.
- What'll happen to Pop and Barbara?
Oh, now, now, don't you worry.
Everything's going to be all right.
- That old pumpkin! I'd like to...
- Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh!
Come on. Get some more.
Come on. Hurry.
Come on. Get some more.
Come on. Hurry.
- Aren't you afraid, Betsy?
- You might fall and hurt yourself.
Oh, please don't do it, Betsy.
I've got to get to Pop. He's in trouble, and I've gotta be with him.
- Is it tight enough?
- Uh-huh.
- All right. Bye.
- Bye.
But what'll we tell the matron?
Uh, tell her I've gone out west to fight Indians.
Be awfully careful, Betsy.
- [ All ] Bye. Bye.
- Shh.
- What's your name?
- Betsy. What's yours?
Harry.
Where are you going?
- Home.
- Where's home?
New York, on 49th Street.
That's a million miles from here.
- I am not going that far.
- Take me as far as you go?
All right. How come you got way out here?
You see, last night I was riding home with my dad in his car.
He was driving awfully fast... and all of a sudden he hit a bump in the road... and I bounced right out of the car.
- And he didn't know it?
- No.
What a dope.
You got to get off at the next corner.
If I could get to a subway, it would almost get me home.
If... if I had a nickel.
Thanks a lot for the ride.
I appreciate it very much.
- Bye.
- So long.
Come on! Get off!
Well, here's a nickel.
- Oh, thanks.
- Come on, will ya? Scram! Get off!.
How far is it to the subway station?
Six blocks, and
I am not going that way!
Please take me to the subway station.
Oh, all right.
You dames are all alike.
Your witness, Mr. Barron.
Mr. Wendling, isn't it true that you intend to use this money... to put on a vaudeville show?
A small portion of it, yes, sir.
And you intend to put this show on with actors living at the Hotel Variety?
- That's right.
- Isn't it quite probable... that this vaudeville venture of yours may prove a failure?
Or, in the Broadway vernacular, a flop?
What? With me and the band? I object!
Order! Order in the court!
Do my eyes believe me?
That's Betsy. Oh, I'm so glad to see you.
I'm glad to see you, but where is everybody?
They're over in the courthouse.
- Why aren't you there?
- You see, the crowds make Oscar nervous.
I've got to get to the trial, Ole.
You've got to take me.
Please, I want to be with Pop.
You must take me there, Ole.
Well, all right.
Come on, Oscar. Got to go.
Miss Wendling, do you know William J. Shea?
I do.
Have you ever seen your nephew in the company of Barbara Shea?
I object!
They told me they would be in here.
There's Pop, and there's Barbara!
Order.! Order in the court!
Well, I rode on bicycles...
Order! Order in the...
Go on to the case, please.
Has your nephew ever asked you for money for any business ventures of any kind?
- Only once, about two weeks ago.
- Did you give it to him?
- I did not.
- Why?
Because he wanted to throw it away on worthless, good-for-nothing actors.
They are not good-for-nothing!
They're the nicest people in the whole world!
You said it, Bets. Your Honor, I object to the lady's incinerations.
It's irrelephant, immemorial and a bare-faced lie.
If there's any more of this,
I'll clear the courtroom.
Your Honor, that child belongs in an orphanage.
I put her there myself.
Those scoundrels have kidnapped her.
I came here all by myself!.
That's another fib you told, Miss Wendling.
Bring that youngster up here.
Young lady, do you realize you're guilty of contempt of court?
I'm awfully sorry, but it just made me mad... to hear Miss Wendling say those mean things about my friends...
'cause they aren't true.
Honest, Mr. Judge, they're wonderful actors.
Just wonderful!
This young lady doesn't seem to agree with you, Miss Wendling.
But she never saw them act.
Did you, Miss Wendling?
And if you saw them act, Mr. Judge... if you saw Jimmy and his band and everybody... oh, I know you'd think they were wonderful too.
- If it please the court, I'd like to...
- Just a minute.
I believe this court can be saved a lot of time and argument... by following the splendid suggestion that has just been made.
It appears the immediate issue in this case... is whether or not the plaintiff s proposal to invest his money is a sound one.
Your Honor doesn't mean that...
I mean that I want to see this show right here in this courtroom tomorrow.
Court adjourned!
You were swell!
Yeah, yeah, start your show.
I mean, uh, present your evidence, please.
#Your Honor
I lay my case before you#
#With a show you're invited now to see with me#
#It's a wow one, I hope that you'll agree with me#
#Their business show business#
#Just comes to no business without backing#
#That's all they're lacking#
#All they need is a chance#
#A chance to smile to laugh, to sing, to dance#
#And that is that#
#And that is all#
#So thank you for the use of the hall#
O-Order! Order!
You may proceed.
I-Is your evidence ready?
My first evidence,
Your Honor, exhibit “A.”
#Oh, ye'll take the high road and I'll take the low road#
#And I'll be in Scotland afore ye#
#But me and my true love#
#Will never meet again#
#On the bonny, bonny#
Don't stop singing, gentlemen.
Won't you sing a song for me?
#I'm afraid you wouldn't like the old-time numbers that we sing#
- Why?
- #People don't like them nowadays#
#All they want to do is swing#
Well, why don't you take an old song and swing it? How would that be?
#But how do we do it#
There's nothing to it.
#Just follow me#
#First of all you start to sway#
#Back and forth
That's the way#
#And now that you've got yourself swinging#
#Do the same thing with your singing#
#Swing me an old-fashioned song#
#Down by the old mill stream#
#Da-da-dee-da-da, swing me an old-fashioned song#
#Old-fashioned song#
#Croon me an old-fashioned tune
Da-da-da-da-da#
#In the evening by the moonlight#
#You can hear those darkies singing#
- #Oh, croon me an old-fashioned tune#
- #Won't you croon a tune#
#Just keep it soft and sweet with rhythm from the start#
#But keep that old-time beat#
#The beat that's straight from the heart#
#Swing me an old-fashioned song#
#I wandered today through the hills, Maggie#
#That's it, it's just an old-fashioned song#
#Dear old girl, the robins sing about you#
- #Rah#
- #Dee-rah-dee-rah, rah, rah#
Won't you try it?
#Oh, my darling
Oh, my darling, darling#
#Croon me an old-fashioned tune#
#Just keep it soft and sweet#
#With rhythm from the start#
#But keep that old-time beat#
#The beat that's straight from the heart#
#Won't you swing us an old-fashioned song#
#Ye'll take the high road and I'll take the low road#
#And I'll be in Scotland afore ye#
#That's how to swing#
#An old-fashioned song#
#Now sing and you'll be happy all day long #
# Sing an old-fashioned song#
Yeah!
Order! Order! Order!
Proceed, please.
Your Honor, mark it exhibit “B.”

I, Lemuel Gulliver
give thee a faithful history
of my most interesting adventure
in the South Sea.
On the 5th day of November, 1699,
having reached latitude 30 degrees,
two minutes south,
a storm of great fury suddenly...
All's well!
All's well!
# All's well! What's a rainy day? #
# Never mind that cloud. #
# Behind that cloud you'll find a golden ray. #
# All's well! Laugh your fears away. #
# See the light ahead. Right ahead. #
# There's a moonlit night ahead. #
# Everyone, come on have fun. All's well! #
Why do they make me sing that song?
The poet who wrote it was certainly wrong.
It's bright ahead. The light's ahead.
I'd rather go home and go right to bed.
All's well!
My feet are wet and my bunions ache, and yet I've to keep wide awake, all night!
I wake folks up to tell them things are all right!
And, # All's well! What's a rainy day? #
# Never mind that cloud. #
# Behind that cloud you'll find a golden ray. #
# All's well! Laugh your fears away. #
# See the light ahead. Right ahead. #
# There's a moonlit night ahead. #
# Everyone, come on have fun. All...
A, A, All's well! Wha, wha, what's a rainy day?
The king has visitors.
Do you know they're signing a wedding contract?
There's a giant on the beach!
There, there's a giant out there!
Your majesty.
Thank you, your majesty.
Marriage Contract
King Little of Lilliput
Does this 5th day of November 1699 give the hand of his daughter
Princess Glory to Prince David son of Bombo
King of Blefuscu!
Quite in order, fine.
King Bombo!
Well we did it, you little rascal, you.
We did it.
Yes we, we certainly did, didn't we?
Just a couple of old dag cupids, I think! [laughs}
Your majesty, the wedding things are here.
There's a giant on the beach!
Let me go!
Let me go! Let me go!
There's a giant on the beach! Let me go!
Exquisite taste, exquisite!
Roses, Freesia, Rhododendrons,
Ranunculus, Snap Dragons, and Daisies.
Ahh!
They're pretty Posies, aren't they?
Beautiful blooms, beautiful!
Oh!
May I?
Oh, please do!
Magnificent!
Oh! A masterpiece!
Vanilla. Wow!
# Faithful. Remember, that whatever I do,
I'm always faithful, my love. #
# Faithful, with all my soul and thankful for you, #
# who came from heaven above. #
# We'll dance tonight together, on a world with me we'll find. #
My only little daughter. I dread losing her.
Huh, Buck up there old boy, you're not losing a daughter. You’re gaining a son.
My son!
# So I'll be faithful and faithful as I promise to be, and you'll be for all mine. #
Hmm. Lovely melody.
Yes, we like it.
That is Faithful. The song of Lilliput.
It will be played at the wedding tomorrow.
Of course. Of course.
What's that, Faithful? Oh, no, no! Forever!
The song of Blefuscu must be played at the wedding.
But Bombo, Faithful is always played at our weddings.
It, it's tradition, sir. And it's very pretty.
Yes, yes, I know. Pleasant little ditty, oh but hardly appropriate for this great occasion.
But Forever! There's a song for you! Ha, ha!
Faithful will be played.
Bah! Fodder. Absolute fodder. It must be Forever!
Faithful.
Forever!
Faithful.
Forever!
Faithful.
It will be Forever, or there will be no wedding!
No wedding? But the cake and the pretty flowers and.. oh Bombo, you'll love Faithful.
Ahh!
It's war!
There's a giant on the beach!
It's war!
War. Woe is me. Woe is me.
I found a mountain, your majesty. I found it!
It was man, a man mountain!
War isn't nice.
It was, was this big!
No, no. It was this big!
People get hurt in wars.
He's as big, as big as, as,.. big as, as, as..
Wait your majesty!
Bombo can't frighten me. No sir.
Don't stand there like a nincompoop!
I'm trying to tell you that there's a giant!
When I get my dandruff up, then look out.
But Glory, poor little Glory.
Don't look now gentleman, but it's war.
War? Whoopee!
# Forever, forever, #
# There won't be anyone but you. #
# Remember I'm true, my sweet. #
# Forever, forever, #
# You'll share in everything I do, #
# And keep smiling through, my sweet. #
# I'll have just you here in my heart, #
# And I'll trust you though we're apart. #
# So, forever, forever, #
# My guiding angel you will be. #
# So always have faith in me. #
Shh!
Shh!
Shh!
War. Ha. Ha. Rolls off my back like a duck.
But, but I'm, but I'm trying to tell ya!

Be off with you. Shoo! Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!
A war?
Do you suppose he could be a, a spy?
Who's a spy? Who's a spy?

Well ah, ah, I can't understand it.
It was right here.

Giant, huh! Dragging us out into the dead of the night.

Gabby must have been seeing things.
Maybe it just got up and flew away.
Yeah, and breathing fire.
Look out Gabby.

Faithful was always played at our weddings... Faithful.
Faithful.
Your, your, your majesty.
Huh?
I've got the giant!
The giant. Oh, yes, yes, the giant.
Well bring him in. Bring him in.
Okay. Okay.
Your majesty, I don't think he'd fit in here.
Oh you don't, huh?
So it's not good enough for him, hmm?
Well where is he?

Now, then.
Humph! Not good enough for him!
Well, where is he?
From here. On!
Call out the guards, the army, the navy, women and children first, I'll see you later.

Defend the city!
We're attacked! We're attacked!
Stop! Stop you swine!
Get back to your posts!
Get back there and fight!
We of Blefuscu are not!
... afraid of anything.
Well, where's everyone gone?
This is no way to treat a harmless visitor.
Look Gabby, we've won! Gabby! Gabby?
See Gabby? They've gone.
Yes, sir. Scared stiff.
Hello there.
Come now, don't let my size frighten you.
You, your majesty, surely you're not afraid of me?
Nuh uh.
Well, good. Then let me present myself.
My name is Gulliver, your majesty.
Lemuel Gulliver, a shipwrecked sailor.
At your service.
Well, welcome to Lilliput,
Mr., Mr. Gulliver.
Uh Mr. Gulliver, can you fight?
Well your majesty,
I can lick anybody my size.
Ah, splendid, splendid!
I don't think Bombo will give us any further trouble while you're around here.
No sir!
He's on our side, Gabby.
He's on our side!
There's nothing to fear!
The man mountain's on our side!

You understand that not until that giant is removed can our forces taste the sweet fruits of victory!
Now then, it is up to you to carry this message to my spies in Lilliput.
Be off and may luck be with you!
Too-de-loo!
Get going!
Your majesty, I'm sorry the little princess isn't with us.
Yes, too bad. Too much excitement for one day.
Dear spies: Get rid of that Giant or else... Cordially yours King Bombo

I see that you're a sailor boy.
I owned a boat. A beauty, too.
Fifty times as big as your a, as big as your a, as big as your shoe.
My, my.
Hoy, hoy.
Lost her though in a glorious gale, but I came home on the back of a whale.
But tell me though how you caught the whale.
Simply grabbed a hold of his tail.
My, my.
I, I,
I climbed a mountain peak so high.
I bumped my head against the sky.
And there I was, where was I?
On the Island of Alibi.
Hoy, hoy.
My, my.
Hi, hi.
But now my life is very dull.
They ought to make me an admiral.
Now that's the job that I'd enjoy.
I must be going. Ahoy! Ahoy!
My, my, my.
You put that ball in there.
And then it goes down and around.
Pull that thing.
And it comes out here.
The g-g-g-g-giant!
Wow!
The light. The light.
Douse the light!
He's gone.
Phew!
Hello! Anybody in there?
Nobody here but just us spi...
Chickens!
My, my.
# Forever, forever, #
# There won't be anyone but you. #
# Remember I'm true, my sweet. #
# Forever, forever, #
# La, la, la, la, la, la. #
# Forever, forever, #
Forever! Forever!
That's the song of Blefuscu!
A spy!
Charge!
A spy!
A spy!
Charge!
A spy! A spy!
Charge!
Where is he? Where did he go?
Concealing a spy.
And at a time of war, too.
That makes it worse!
Carry on the search men!
Mind you, your father will hear of this.
King Bombo,
Say the word and the giant is a dead duck.
..is a dead duck.
P.S. What do we do with the body?
Two hearts and a wedding broken by a melody?
Incredible!
Wait a minute.
I have an idea that might turn this malice to a melody!
Sing Faithful and Forever together, as one song.
The giant will be a dead duck.
Ha! Now we are getting at somewhere!
Dear Spies, Destroy. Crush.
Obliterate! Annihilate!
Kill him!
I will attack at dawn!
Affectionately yours, Bombo.
Whatcha got there?
Attack at dawn. Attack..
Bombo's attack.., Bom..., Bom...
Guards! Guards! Guards!
Bombo's attacking! Bombo's attacking!
Bombo's attacking at dawn!
Bombo's attacking! It's war!
Bombo's attacking! It's war! It's war!
It's the end of the ending!
To the beach! To the beach!
Bomb.. attacking!
What?
Bombo attacking!
It's war! It's war!
To the beach! To the beach!
The enemy attacks!
To defend Lilliput.
To defend Lilliput!
Yes, forward march.
Gulliver! Gulliver! Where are you?
Bombo's attacking.
Where are you Gulliver?
We'll be wiped out!
Gulliver where are you?
Gulliver! Gulliver! Bombo's attacking!
Gulliver! Gulliver! Bombo's attacking!
It's war! Gulliver! It's war!
Gulliver! Where are you?
Gulliver! Gulliver! It's war!
Gulliver! Bombo's attacking!
Bombo's attacking! It's war!
Put me down.
Hah! Well, where you been you lazy, long legged, overgrown lummox?
Now, get down there to that beach and wipe out that Bombo and that bunch of Blefuscuians.
And tear em to pieces and don't leave a man alive to tell the tale.
Forward march! Get going!
Aye, aye, sir!
My, oh my.
Hey! Wait for me.
Gulliver, wait for me!
Wait for me, Gulliver!
No note.
Where is it?
What did you done with it?
Where did you lose it?
Who's got it now?
Gulliver! Gulliver! Wait for me!
Gulliver! Gulliver!
Let me go! Let me go!
Let's go!
Hold on there!
We can settle this peacefully.
Listen!
Hold you fire!
Hear what I have to say.
Bombo, order your men to lay down their arms.
Must I make you listen?
David, look! Gulliver's thunder machine.
Wait here, Glory.
David!
Fire!
Fire!
Pull! Come on! Pull! Pull!
David!
Poor, poor, foolish little people.
Look what you've done.
Now go ahead! Break your nutshell heads over your songs!
But did you have to break Glory's heart,
King Little, because you are thoughtless and selfish?
And you Bombo, o mighty warrior, what have you won?
You were too stubborn to think, too busy quarrelling to lend ear to the harmony that might have been yours.
But now in your sorrow and despair, perhaps you will listen to your songs as they might be sung.
# Faithful forever whatever I do #
# Remember I'm true, #
# remember that #
# Faithful forever and thankful for you #
# I'll keep smiling through, #
# remember that #
# We may be apart now and then #
# But I'll hold you in my heart #
# Till you're in my arms again #
# Faithful forever I promise to be #
# So always have faith in me #
In behalf of the peoples of
Blefuscu and Lilliput,
With eternal gratitude and love in our hearts, we christen thee, Gulliver!
# Come back again, come back #
# Wherever you may be #
# Come back again you sailor man, sailor man #
# Back again from the sea #
# Come back again you sailor man, sailor man #
# Back again from the sea #

It's a boy!
A prince is born!
Long live the Prince of Wales!
Sit up and drink hearty.
The only cost of a tankard is that it's drunk to His wee Royal Highness...
The Prince of Wales!
Long live His Royal Highness, the Prince of Wales!
Here.
Milords and ladies...
I ask you to toast my son...
Edward Tudor.
One moment.
You drink too fast.
I advise you that as you drink, you pray for your own sakes... that my son be a good king.
Because good or bad, sickly or hale... craven or brave, he will be King!
You drank sparingly, my good Norfolk.
Wine does not agree with me,
Your Majesty.
A pity.
Because losing one's head from wine... is so much less permanent than losing it from treason.
Surely, Your Majesty does not think me guilty of that.
Not at all, my good Norfolk.
Merely capable of it.
- It's a boy, Henry.
- So I've been informed.
- You're glad?
- Very.
And grateful to you, madam... not only for furnishing the House of Tudor with an heir... but also for freeing your King from further necessity of your being.
Poor little thing.
Brought into this world to wear a crown whether it fits him or not.
It shall weigh him down... until he'll wish he'd been born to the meanest pauper in London.
Poor little thing.
Poor nothing.
He's a healthy brat.
Healthy, is he?
You'd have an healthy son, when all the time... you know it's only the sickly ones who can beg a farthing nowadays.
A prince was born tonight, too, little baby.
So go to sleep and pretend the bells are for you.
Here he is. I think this cur ought to have his head whacked off!
Boil him in oil, I says, Your Highness.
A good stewing is what he needs.
Let's give it to him.
- What has he done, my good lords?
- He won't play, that's what.
Let this miscreant kneel before me.
Down, you scurvy nipper.
Why don't you want to play, bumpkin?
'Cause I don't want to be boiled in oil.
It'd hurt.
Coward!
Hold your tongue. He's right. It would hurt.
A good king is a merciful king.
I will show mercy.
If I make you one of my lords, will you play?
Yes, I will.
I dub thee Sir Hawkins.
Arise.
Absit invidia'
What's that?
It's Latin. And it means:
Let there be no malice.
Father Andrew taught it to me.
He'd do better to teach you how to bring home a farthing.
I'll knock them royal ideas out of your head!
You drooling beast,
I'll cuff your mouth and like it!
Now, then!
He's certainly thumping the King good.
Maybe that'll keep the tears in your eyes long enough to beg a penny for food.
Now, be off with you!
May I come in?
But you are in.
Thomas, have you been crying?
No, sir. It's sweat.
You see, I've been running.
And how did you come by that?
Your father?
No, sir. My father wouldn't beat me.
He likes me.
I apologize.
Thank you.
Someday I'm going to discuss you with your father.
No, I wouldn't, sir.
You see, he doesn't like to see anyone... on account of he feels so badly about me having to beg.
I thought maybe you'd let me read some more out of that Latin book.
Of course.
The more you read, the greater opportunity you'll have... of escaping Offal Court when you grow up.
But you've read most everything, and you're still in Offal Court, Father.
God's will and the whimsy of a king are two things... it isn't for ordinary people to understand,
I presume, Tom.
Why did His Majesty turn you out of your house... and take away your pension, when you didn't do anything to him?
I'm afraid nowadays, the King knows very little about his subjects.
Except those in his court... who take great pains he shouldn't learn... the plight of others less fortunate than themselves.
Do you know what I'd do if I were the King?
I'd send the Prince out to play with other little boys.
Then he'd learn about the people and be a good king when he grew up.
A rather unlikely suggestion.
Get on with your reading while the light is good.
Perhaps I'd better, because I've been at it two days now... and I haven't got Caesar across the Rubicon yet.
Tell me all about it.
I'll tell you, there's more gold there than you ever thought was in the world... just dying to be took.
- What's that you're reading?
- A book.
- Stole it?
- No.
Father Andrew gave it to me. To keep.
Wasn't that kind of him?
I should say so. It's very valuable.
Only rich people can afford to buy books.
- Give it here.
- Please don't tear it.
Tear it, you barmy mooncalf? I'll sell it.
This'll fetch a nice bit of meat and ale.
Please, give me back my book.
Come on, Hugo.
We're going to the thieves market.
A windfall from heaven, I calls it.
And if I catch you with that smirking priest again...
I'll peel the hide off both of you!
My book.
Go away! Get out of here! Go on!
Penny, please?
But it is time we spoke of certain things,
Your Majesty.
My death among them, I suppose.
Death?
What made you think of death, sire?
For one thing, finding a carrion crow flying around my bed.
Banish the thought, sire.
- You're still a hale man.
- I'm not a man at all.
I'm a disease.
An infernally painful one. Go on.
It occurred to me, sire, that when
Prince Edward comes to the throne...
The court may impose the Duke of Norfolk on him... as Lord High Protector.
And with reason, Hertford.
What a sorry thing it is to be a bad king.
To worry on your deathbed about your dynasty... and not about your people.
To be able to forgive a man his sins, and not his virtues.
And Norfolk has virtue.
And the House of Tudor has sins.
But they won't be judged by the Howards.
You are very right, Your Majesty.
The protector will be a man who nibbles at the hand of the court.
Whose power frightens only the ladies.
And whose chief ambition is to build a safe nest in the throne.
You'll forgive me if I say the description resembles that of a palace rat.
- You mean...
- I mean you.
I am unable to tell my gratitude for this honor, sire.
But it will enable me to...
To regret my passing with the greatest possible pleasure.
There is one thing, sire... which may prevent your selection of me from being carried out.
- Who? Warwick?
- No, sire.
The Prince himself.
Norfolk has bewitched him.
He worships the man, calls him uncle.
But for some strange reason,
His Highness has taken a dislike to me.
If you let the selection go, until your death...
His little Highness will undoubtedly appoint Norfolk.
No.
Because I intend to arrange matters... so that Norfolk's death will precede my own.
- Indeed, Your Majesty?
- Indeed.
Now, ask His Highness to come here.
I think I'd like to play now.
May we play charades, Your Highness?
Lady Jane, I've told you I hate charades.
I'm sorry.
All right. We'll play charades later.
After we play something I like.
Quill, you suggest something.
And if it doesn't suit me, I'll beat you.
And if it does suit you, it'll be a game you'll beat me at anyway.
Therefore, it might as well be... blind man's buff.
Good. That would amuse me.
- I'm it.
- Here's my handkerchief.
- Should I be first, sir?
- Shout so I know where you are.
All right.
Spin him round and around.
There you are.
Now, guess where we are.
Your Highness.
- Are you hurt, Edward?
- Edward?
Pardon me, Your Highness.
Someday I'll have your head cut off for calling me that.
But perhaps your feet would be better.
They're more in the way.
Why are you here, milord?
His Majesty awaits, Your Highness.
Very well.
You are not dismissed. I'm coming back.
I'm glad you sent for me, Father.
They wouldn't let me see you this afternoon.
- You tried?
- Yes.
- What did you want?
- Nothing. Just wanted to see you.
Come here.
Sit down.
One of these days, Edward...
- I'll be going away.
- To war, Father?
No. To peace, I hope.
But where?
To face the one being... who knows there is no
Divine Right of Kings.
After I've gone, Edward, you'll wear the crown.
- But...
- Be still. Listen and remember.
There is only one crown in England.
But there are many heads it will fit.
So a wise king removes those heads.
That is politics.
When you sit in judgment... remember your seat is but a chair... made by the English oak, hewn by English yeomen... and made into a throne only... by the will of the English people.
That is patriotism.
There's one thing more.
A king may answer to no man.
Not even to himself.
To have a conscience is to have a chink in your armor... to let in the knives of those you love... and trust, and need.
Remember what I am saying.
Never trust so much...
Love so much... or need anyone so much... that you can't betray them with a smile.
That is the paradox of power.
I suppose you're too young to understand that.
No, Father. I can even understand Aristotle in the original Greek.
You're like your mother.
- What was my mother like?
- A dull woman.
- She'd have bored you.
- No, she wouldn't. I'd have loved her.
Where is she?
Got another biscuit?
Your Majesty forgot to mention your selection to His Highness.
Bring me that casket.
- Do you know what this is?
- Yes, Father. The Great Seal of England.
There's strange magic in it, Edward.
It can make a royal whim a law.
An innocent man guilty.
A poor man rich.
A dangerous toy for a child... and a fool.
I advise you to use it sparingly and seldom.
Lest it seal your own doom.
I am entrusting it to you.
When the time comes for you to use it...
I want you to consult...
- Doctors again.
- Your Majesty.
You must be left undisturbed.
Milords, you must leave
His Majesty at once.
- Rest is the only physic that will cure him.
- Is there no escape from you?
After a lifetime of dodging cannonballs, am I to be done in by pills?
Your Majesty, can that be a biscuit?
What do you think it is, the Archbishop's head?
May I ask, Your Highness, and you, Lord Hertford... to retire, for the King's good?
Yes, of course.
Your Majesty.
Tomorrow.
- Tomorrow.
- But, Your Majesty...
Get out!
All of you!
- You, too.
- Yes, Father.
Yes, Father.
- Good night.
- Good night, Father.
Where are Lady Jane and Lady Elizabeth?
Their nurse came to inform them that it was their bedtime.
- My dog, where is he?
- He's been taken to the kennels.
- Fetch him.
- Your Highness, this is our post.
If we leave it, we would have to answer to the King himself.
Is that a dog under there?
- A boy.
- Out of there, you little tyke.
- Out of there!
- Yes, Father.
Impertinent from the likes of you.
A sneak thief? How did you get in here?
I'm not a thief, sir. I just beg.
You've just begged yourself a skinful of broken bones this time.
Maybe this will teach you respect for His Majesty's Guard.
Maybe that will teach you respect for His Majesty's subjects.
- Your Highness, forgive me, I...
- Keep quiet.
Are you hurt, boy?
- Are you hurt?
- No, sir, Your Highness, sir.
- What are you doing here, boy?
- It was raining, Your Highness.
I just slipped through, milord, because...
So I could sleep under the bench where it was dry, Your Highness.
I'm not a desperate character,
Your Highness. Honest, I'm not.
I'm certain you're not.
Had you been, the Captain would've been under the bench, not you.
- Your Highness, you don't understand.
- Keep quiet.
You annoy me enough when you're silent.
You're not thinking of beheading me, are you, Your Majesty?
No.
I was wondering whether or not you were too dirty to play with.
You couldn't play with me.
I'm a beggar boy.
I can play with anyone I please.
I'm the Prince.
Come along.
We'll wait for him to come out from beneath His Highness' wing.
And when he does, we'll skin him.
I didn't think that if I were very good all my life... and died and went to heaven,
I'd ever see anything like this.
- Or meet a real prince, either.
- Don't bother to flatter me.
I get enough of that from the court.
I must remember to have the Captain beheaded when I'm king.
No, you mustn't.
Not on account of me, at least.
Damnant quod non intelligunt'
- You know Latin?
- Yes. Father Andrew taught me.
Never heard of the man.
Your father has, and he doesn't like him at all.
- He took away his house and his pension.
- Must be a priest.
Yes, he is.
- I thought so.
- You'd like him.
We Tudors hate priests.
- Why?
- Because we...
Just because we don't like them,
I suppose.
I don't think that's a very good reason.
I did hear Warwick saying something to Uncle Thomas... that's the Duke of Norfolk... about Father wanting to get a new queen... and the priest not wanting him to.
Father must have won the argument.
Because we had two queens that year... and another new one now, Lady Parr.
But you can't have three mothers.
Neither can you.
I haven't even got one mother.
- She died when I was a baby.
- So did mine.
But anyway, a queen is a prince's mother.
And you say there's been three.
Six.
Six queens?
Then, you'd have six mothers, but you couldn't have six mothers.
I can't figure it out.
Neither can I.
You may have a pear if you like.
A pear? Which is the pear?
- Haven't you ever seen a pear before?
- No, but I've read about them.
- Nice, aren't they?
- Eat it, lad.
Like it?
Crikey.
It tastes so good,
I almost feel like a prince myself.
You certainly don't look like one.
Unless it would be a prince of paupers.
I will be when I get back to Offal Court... and tell them I've been in the palace and talked to you.
The only trouble is they won't believe me.
Why not, pray?
You see, in Offal Court, a prince is... kind of like Saint Nicholas.
You hear about him, but you never see him... because you couldn't expect him to come to see poor people.
The Prince of Offal Court.
It would be amusing to see their faces.
They'll believe you because when you arrive, you shall be wearing my clothes.
- Sword and all.
- Your clothes?
Why not? Clothes make the prince.
Are there any vermin in this?
So few you'll hardly notice them at all,
Your Highness.
You go wash your face. Over there.
Use the towel.
Penny, please. Please give me a penny.
Don't bother me, my lad.
Why, you look like me.
On the contrary, you look like me.
That's what I said, Your Highness.
We look alike.
- Do you know any games, boy?
- Yes, Your Highness, lots of them:
- Duck and drake, robber and constable.
- How do you play that?
It takes three to play it: A robber, somebody to be robbed, and a constable.
You see, I rob you of something, hide it.
Then you tell the constable, and he and you try to find it.
While you're looking for it, I hide.
Then you and he have to find me to make the arrest, just as in real life.
- Good. I like that. We'll play it.
- But we have no constable.
I'll get my dog.
He'll be a marvelous constable.
He can find anybody no matter where they hide.
Wait here. I'll get him.
- There he goes, running for it.
- After him.
If he gets away, you'll sweat for it.
Not so fast, me lad.
- Captain wants to pay his respects to you.
- Are you mad?
Do you want to lose your heads?
How dare you touch me!
Listen to that.
The Prince must have knighted him.
Now for your lesson, you filthy little beggar.
Beggar? Are you insane?
I'm Prince Edward!
Make way for His Royal Highness, the Prince of Pewy.
I'll have your blood for this, and on my own sword.
Come back whenever you like. The Guard prides itself on entertaining royalty.
Why wasn't His Highness prepared for bed last night?
Because, Your Grace, he didn't ring.
Your Highness.
Where's the Prince?
The Prince?
Yes, the Prince.
Where is he?
But, Your Highness, you are the Prince.
Please, milords, I'm not the Prince.
He went out to get a constable.
I mean, his dog.
And he didn't come back.
I'm a beggar boy.
Don't behead me. Say you won't.
This is not the time for jesting,
Your Highness.
Indeed, it isn't, because I'm in a pickle.
It's all so muddled. The Prince will have my head because I have his clothes.
If the King finds out, he'll have me boiled in oil.
The Prince isn't here right now, but I'm sure he'll come back.
Please, Your Highness, discontinue this whimsy at our expense.
That's just it. I'm not your highness.
I'm Tom Canty, a beggar boy, and I wish I were at it now.
I'm afraid His Highness is ill.
Very ill.
- This will be a death blow to His Majesty.
- We mustn't tell him.
Please, Your Highness, get up from your knees.
What would your father say if he saw you?
In here?
He'd say somebody boosted me through a window.
'Tis true. His Majesty is gravely ailing.
That is God's will.
To inform him that his sins are to rule and live after him... in a daft boy, would be murder.
Neither alchemy nor prayer can cheat death of His Majesty's soul much longer.
But England can be cheated of a rightful king... should His Majesty not proclaim his son... and appoint a Lord Protector before his death.
And who might that be?
One who might not forget a favor done now.
What? Treason!
I talked to him last night, and he was sane as a bishop.
I know, Your Majesty. I saw him then, too.
- 'Tis an evil miracle.
- You lie, I tell you!
I would I did, Your Majesty, that you might be spared the proof.
Stop croaking! Fetch the boy!
Mad, they say.
Too much study.
Sane one minute...
Taken complete leave of his senses.
Doesn't even recognize anyone.
Your Majesty.
The King.
I am done for.
Come, my son.
Sit by me.
Let us talk, you and I.
But I'm not me.
I'm Tom Canty, Your Majesty. Sir.
Tom, sir.
Come, lad.
Would you deny that I am your father?
Yes, sire.
I wouldn't dare let anyone think such a thing.
What envenomed irony fate has wrought.
He doesn't know his own father.
But I do, Your Majesty.
A thief he is and was sorely mean to me.
Please, don't behead me.
Please, let me go home.
You've done this, you pedantic fools.
Whipping his mind with Latin and Greek till it's broken its halter and run wild.
Now take him, cure him, amuse him, freshen him.
Teach him the good English oaths of the hunting field.
Oaths that a man may use in ruling a country.
Not the foreign prattle of priests and scholars!
It shan't be long before you'll know me, little Edward.
Please, Your Majesty.
I'm not Edward. I'm Tom.
These aren't even my clothes.
I'm a beggar boy.
They won't believe me.
Please tell them I'm not your little boy.
This, milords... is my son... who shall sit on the throne and rule.
If not by reason of his wit... then by reason of the name of Tudor.
Summon the entire court to the Throne Room.
And bid them... hurry.
Milords and ladies.
In the past... you have jealously kept my bounty to yourselves.
But soon you'll be sharing it with the worms.
And what is left will probably rattle... in the posits of time.
England... could not shed enough tears to cleanse the name of Henry.
But I promise you... neither can England shed enough blood... to wash the name of Tudor from the roll of kings.
Don't deceive yourselves.
I am not threatening you from the grave.
My power will be buried with my body... and disintegrate as soon.
I'm threatening you with your own weakness... which I've nurtured for years.
Feeding one's greed with another's deceit.
Tolerating treachery.
Until, milords and ladies, you've grown so corrupt... that each could only conceal his guilt in the shadow of the others.
Hence, your heads remain on your shoulders... only as long as a Tudor sits on the throne... to cloak your infamies from the people... behind the purple robes of royalty.
The old dog dies... and the lice daren't desert his pup... lest they starve!
It is my will... that my son, Edward... shall succeed me to the throne.
And that his tutelage and counsel... be entrusted... to a Lord...
High... to a Lord...
High Protector.
And that he... be...
Your Majesty.
The Protector is to be who?
Who?
And now... to face them... all.
The King is dead.
Long live the King.
Let us pray.
The body which was Henry's... will once again become with the earth from which it was molded.
The soul we relegate to God.
The reign, to his royal Majesty, Edward VI.
Can I go home now, please?
Permit me, Your Majesty.
Repeat after me, and when you have finished... strike my shoulder with your sword.
- Aren't your afraid it will cut you?
- With the flat of it, Your Majesty.
Repeat: Let it be known to all my subjects...
"Let it be known to all my subjects..."
- But I'm not the Prince.
...and throughout my realm...
"And throughout my realm..."
...that I hereby designate the Earl of Hertford...
"That I hereby designate the Earl of Hertford..."
...as my Lord High Protector, to direct... with adult advice, my untried judgment.
"As my Lord High Protector, to direct, with adult advice..."
- My untried judgment.
- "My untried judgment."
Death may have been on Norfolk's side, but a brain was on ours.
But fortunately, an addled one.
I'm honored by your selection,
Your Majesty.
- Did I select you for something?
- Yes, Your Majesty.
Henceforth, it is I, not Norfolk, in whom you will confide and trust.
Who's Norfolk?
You can't recall him? That's a pity.
Such a little time remains to make his acquaintance.
I bid you good day, sire.
Please, my lord.
You said I was to confide in you.
Mayn't I do it now?
Wait outside.
His Majesty has some affairs of state which he wishes to discuss.
Yes, milord.
Now, Edward, what is it?
Please, won't you believe that I'm just me and not the Prince?
You're no longer the Prince, Your Majesty.
You're the King.
I'm Tom Canty, I tell you, and I went to sleep in the palace garden.
His Highness brought me in because...
I imagine he was sorry that the Captain of the Guard bashed me.
And what became of the Prince, pray?
I don't know. That kind of worries me.
People won't believe him, either, because he was wearing my clothes... and didn't look at all like a prince.
He looked so much like me, that it made us laugh.
I suppose it wasn't so very funny, though.
You don't believe me?
I believe that you've been studying too hard, Your Majesty.
You won't even ask the Captain about what I said?
If you wish it.
I do, because if he doesn't say the same thing... then I must be out of my wits.
What did the boy look like?
Just another street urchin, milord.
The size and age of His Majesty.
Are you sure it wasn't His Majesty?
Of course. This boy was dirty, in tatters.
Then he was the King.
I don't know.
He said he was, and I thought it was impudence.
But he might have been?
He might have been.
There is either a mad prince or a beggar boy on the throne.
Now, I must know which.
That will be easy to tell, milord.
I pray the crime won't be on my head.
- How?
- His dog.
The brute will not suffer anyone to touch him except His Majesty.
Milord, should it not be, use your influence in my defense.
If you can only save me for the present...
If I save you, Captain, it shan't be for the present... but for the future, in which I may find you useful.
I've brought you a playmate, Edward.
- A dog. Mine?
- Yours.
He didn't like me.
No, my little Potentate of Poverty, he didn't like you.
- Then, you know who I am?
- Yes.
- When can I go?
- Never.
Never?
- But, if I'm not the King...
- You are the King.
The only way to lose the crown now is to lose your head with it.
- But I told the truth.
- And committed treason.
Do you know what that means?
You don't want that pretty little head of yours chopped off, do you?
Nor to have your mother see the crows tearing tufts... from a skull on London Bridge... and know that it's her son's hair in which they will nest?
Then never forget that you are Edward VI of England.
And that to ever again become Tom Canty... is to die.
Yes, sir.
- Your men will miss you, Captain.
- No.
I'm sending you away to execute a little mission for both of us.
Yes, milord?
It seems you expelled a king.
Then it was he.
Your syntax is poor, Captain.
"Was" is in the past tense.
It is he.
When he returns, he'll have my blood.
I remember that threat.
And should he return...
Norfolk would be appointed
Lord High Protector in my stead.
- I cannot defend you from a dungeon.
- What's to be done?
Our difficulties would be resolved by His Majesty's permanent absence.
But, milord... that would be murder.
His life or yours, Captain.
He'll be fairly easy to locate.
Your leave starts tonight.
The passing bell.
In good faith, they toll for Henry... little knowing they're sounding the knell of the House of Tudor.
Let us kneel to ask comfort and solace from Almighty God... when the burden of sorrow is upon us, my people.
Comfort us, O Lord... for we are as a child without a father... or as a ship without a rudder, or as a body without a head.
We mourn him whose statesmanship... and wisdom in counsel... have been as a bulwark against the enemies of England.
Thy will, not ours, be done, O Lord.
But strengthen us in this, our time of grief.
Thy people's sorrow and their destiny perish... for Henry, our King, is dead.
And a child sits upon the throne of England.
Imbue him with thy wisdom... thy strength, and thy mercy, O Lord.
Amen.
Father.
Long live the King.
All I hopes is this King ain't... the drunken fool the last was.
What was that scurrilous remark you made about my father?
You deny that you insulted the late King, my father?
Get away, or I'll fetch you one on the side of the head.
I'll have you drawn and quartered for this.
Do you realize you're addressing your King?
The King, are you? Look what's the King.
This ha'penny worth of cat's meat is none other than His Majesty.
Ho there! Lay off!
Didn't you hear me? I said lay off the lad.
Do you know what happens when you stick your nose where it ain't wanted?
Yes, this.
Back, my good people.
- Why don't we consider this situation?
- You'll all rot in chains for this.
Make way for the King's messenger!
Time for us to leave, I think.
- Where does Your Majesty deign to reside?
- In the palace, of course.
- Charboy?
- King.
Let's not play that game anymore.
It's too strenuous.
You dare disclaim me?
No, Your Majesty, only... it'll be a lot easier if you could be something a trifle more sedentary.
Like the Archbishop of Canterbury.
I tell you I am the King.
As you'll learn much to your regret if you don't keep a civil tone.
Very good, sire.
You're a bit done in after that joust.
You need some sleep to straighten you out.
You're too familiar, my man.
I will honor your hospitality tonight.
In the morning, you shall return to the palace with me for your reward.
Thank you, sire.
A drear hovel.
Yes, but then Windsor is so drafty.
I'm hungry.
What have you to tempt my appetite?
That depends on what didn't tempt the mices.
- Mice?
- Yes. I had to fatten them all up.
You see, the cat threatened to leave.
You're making a joke.
The humor of being short of rations, my friend, has always escaped me.
Then, you're poor?
Would you believe it? I am.
Who are you, fellow?
Miles Hendon, Your Majesty.
The name is not familiar.
What is your trade?
- Soldiering, sire.
- In my service?
In the service of anyone who can afford enemies.
Soldier of fortune. Strange profession.
Of the three open to a gentleman without means, it's the most amusing.
Cheating at cards means associating with dull people.
Preaching the gospel means wearing funny hats.
- Better eat, lad.
- Lad?
I beg your pardon, Your Majesty.
I hope you don't think this is a leg of mutton.
A sheep walked around on it for some time under that impression.
Would you sit in the presence of your King?
- See here...
- I will no longer tolerate your manner.
I ask your pardon, Your Majesty.
But after that chase we led them, it would be good to sit down.
Perhaps.
No, custom must be preserved.
You will stand.
I was very hungry.
- I feel better now.
- I'm gratified, Your Majesty.
Come to think of it,
I'm under obligation to you in many ways.
- Your service demands rich reward.
- A mere nothing, Your Majesty.
You may have any reward you wish.
Name it.
The privilege of sitting in your Majesty's presence.
Advance, fellow, and give me your sword.
- Is it that you find the mutton tough, sire?
- Kneel.
While England remains and the Crown continues... you and your heirs forever may sit in the presence of the Majesty of England.
Arise, Sir Miles Hendon.
For pity's sake, sit down.
Thank you, Your Majesty.
Beginning to ache from the hammering they gave you?
Why do you ask?
You seem to be batting away at a few tears.
I'm not the man to snivel at a few bruises.
In fact, we Tudors never cry.
- What's the matter?
- My dad's dead.
Good morning, Your Majesty.
I hope Your Majesty slept well.
Yes, sir.
- Playing follow-the-leader?
- No, sire. We've come to dress you.
Have I enough clothes to go around?
Indeed, sire, everything has been assigned.
Are you ready to perform your ablutions?
His Majesty's towel and bowl.
His Grace the Lord High Protector, awaits your pleasure... and asks that you be informed that a note on the treasury has to be signed.
The household account being depleted.
- There's no money to pay for the palace?
- No, Your Majesty.
I suppose we'll just have to move to a smaller house.
I remember quite a nice one right next to the fish market in Billingsgate.
The rose water, milord.
It has a nice flavor.
Please, sir, how much longer must I do this?
This is the last, sire.
"Authorizes an increased tax on windows."
Do you mean to say we have a tax on windows?
May I suggest that Your Majesty cease troubling himself about...
I'm head of the government. It's my job to be troubled about these things.
And I think a tax on windows is cruel, unjust.
The royal treasury is empty, sire.
Every means of replenishing it must be taken.
Yes, but windows?
When poor people are sick, windows are the only outside they have.
They wouldn't have anything nice to look at if it weren't for windows.
And besides, that's taxing sunshine and light... which don't belong to us at all, but to God.
His Majesty's made a point there.
We will discuss this privately at some later time.
Have we Your Majesty's permission to withdraw?
Yes.
I'll try to think of some better way to raise money.
Did you see an urchin slide out of here?
He left, but sliding wasn't the way he done it.
He says to me,
"Out of my way, fellow," and stalked.
- Where'd he go?
- Good morning, Pam.
- How are the little ones?
- Where did he go?
It wasn't a he, it was a they.
A slimy looking fella come after the lad.
I heard him telling him you'd sent for him.
- I thought it was a bit fishy, but...
- Cut it short. Which way did he go?
Across the street and to the Thieves Booth, and got dragged off.
By whom?
By a foul old croak with a face that looked as if... it had been suckled on the handle of an headman's ax.
- Never mind the face.
- I didn't. I daresay he did.
He sold a candlestick to the receiver.
- I saw him.
- Who sold a candlestick?
The bloke with the face.
- Good day to you, sir.
- The good sir is looking for a bargain?
Yes, I have a skin I'd like to trade in exchange for a little information.
- A skin? Ermine or sable?
- Neither.
- Rodent.
- A rat skin isn't worth anything.
No? Except to the rat, of course.
You see, the skin happens to be yours.
If you want to save it, tell me who that man was...
- who dragged off the beggar boy.
- What man?
The man from whom you bought the candlestick.
- I don't know.
- No? Too bad.
Wait! Mercy.
I daren't tell you. He'd have every thief in London out to slit my throat.
Then I'll save him some trouble.
I'll tell you.
His name is John Canty.
He lives in Offal Court.
The boy is his son, Tom, a little daft on the subject of royalty.
A thousand thanks, sir. Good day, sir.
You must know I'm not Tom because you couldn't be this mean to your own boy!
You dare strike me?
Smash your own father, will you?
I'll show you!
What's the meaning of this?
I'm his father, and you don't happen to be mine.
So keep your holy nose out of it.
- Lf you strike that boy again, I'II...
- You'll do what?
I'll forget that the laying on of hands should be done gently.
I warned you, you meddling old fool!
- Is he dead?
- Shut up.
Come on!
He just sits there and says nothing.
The boy's potty.
And it's because of that Father Andrew always teaching him...
Be quiet about Father Andrew, can't you?
- Were you seen doing anything?
- Shut up.
- What's the pack?
- Father Andrew.
- What about him?
- Dead as a salted herring.
And it's gossip you done him in.
How do you suppose that got about?
From you bashing him over the head and him not getting up again.
You best take to the road.
Blowing hot, is it?
It'll be scorching your heels soon if you don't make to the Roost.
I'm on the run to see the Ruffler.
Don't open your mouth to no one who ain't in on the know.
- We'll head to the river dike.
- Ain't you taking him?
- What for?
- He seen it, didn't he?
That's right, he did.
He'd be a hindrance, but it's better than having him a witness.
He might come in handy, too.
He's the size that can be lifted through a window easy and quiet.
That's right.
It's time I was breaking him for a retriever.
Come here!
If you see such a beggar boy, you'll get five pounds.
Five pounds for a beggar boy?
What'd he do?
Steal the Throne Room out of Windsor?
Another of His Majesty's whims.
He's a bit addlepated, you know.
Remember, look sharp.
Sharp, at five pounds!
A glance from me will nail him to the wall.
Is John about?
I have a bit of business with him.
It wouldn't have to do with the law, would it?
It might have if I don't see him.
You see, he and I...
Just who are you?
His mother.
And for all the drink it gets me,
I might better have begat an empty bottle.
Well, then... perhaps you can use his share of a candlestick we lifted together.
This is once I get my share.
I'm beholden to you, indeed.
Not at all. Where can I find John?
Him and that crazed brat of his had to take to the road.
- Making for the Roost, they are.
- The Roost?
An empty barn near Stullington.
They all holes up there with the Ruffler when it gets hot for 'em.
Yes, of course. The Ruffler.
You say his son is a little unhinged?
Like a gate, he is. Thinks he's a king.
- Has he been this way long?
- No.
John fetched him home like that just today.
Probably gave him one over the head... and cracked it like a nut.
I need money to maintain the palaces, courts, and royal establishments... that His Majesty's dignity be upheld.
May I remark, milord, that it might be more important... to uphold the dignity of England upon the sea?
Let me remind you,
England still has ships afloat.
Barely afloat.
Some of them we daren't fire a cannon aboard for fear of opening up seams.
With the thousands of pounds you've spent on one stable at Windsor... we could've increased the fleet by one-fourth.
You will observe, my lords... how amusingly futile is the bark of an old sea dog... when his teeth have been pulled.
Am I to understand, then, that the Navy is to get nothing?
And that you intend to wheedle a demented boy... into signing these looting demands on the treasury?
That is my intention.
Following the dictates of my judgment and honor.
You admit to honor?
- I boast of it.
- Excellent.
Then you have no alternative but to defend it.
It does not please me to be awakened yet.
You'll wake up, beggar, and pay heed.
- Am I not King anymore?
- Certainly, my most gracious liege.
Good. I'm getting so I kind of enjoy it.
Send for the Lord of the Chamber.
I want something to eat.
- Sign this order.
- What is it?
Sign it.
- Have you seen the Great Seal?
- Great Seal? No.
The great big ones are called walruses.
Stamp, you little fool! A big stamp!
No, I didn't see it. Did you lose it?
The Prince hid it.
When you find the Prince, maybe he'll remember.
- You are looking for him, aren't you?
- Yes, we're looking for him.
"It's our will that Thomas Howard, second Duke of Norfolk...
"steward of the Household, and Lord High Admiral of the fleet...
"be placed under arrest, incarcerated in the Tower...
"and there held for execution for his treasonous plottings...
"against the Crown and the public weal."
Signed Edward Rex.
May I see it?
This order is signed by His Majesty... but not stamped with the Great Seal.
You cannot execute me.
True, but we can keep you in prison... until the Great Seal, which has been mislaid, is found.
And I assure Your Grace, that will be shortly.
You've chosen an excellent way to avoid meeting me in a duel.
A way worthy of you, Hertford.
We await your attendance, milord.
Poor little boy.
Bereft of reason and made the pawn of an unscrupulous scoundrel.
May history learn the truth and forgive Edward.
That song reminds me of Molly One-Eye.
It was her favorite.
What happened to old Molly One-Eye?
Died of honesty, she did.
Tried to turn a penny by telling fortunes... and swiftly, they burned her for a witch.
And a merry blaze she made... with her marrow all soaked in spirits.
Her mistake was in changing her trade.
No, her mistake was being born in England.
Here! No treason, now.
What's wrong with England?
- Her laws.
- What do you know about English law?
Think you're a magistrate?
No.
A human being for whom they're made.
An honest farmer... who had self-respect, a wife, three children, a mother.
All of which have been legislated into potter's field by English law.
Our first sin was committed by my mother... when she went to nurse her sick neighbor.
When the woman died, the doctors couldn't find the cause.
So they solved it... by calling my mother a witch and boiling her in oil... while I and my babes looked on... and learned the meaning of English justice.
We begged from house to house.
I, with two children stumbling and whimpering on either end.
Finally, I stole.
To keep my little Joseph from starving.
But English law decreed otherwise.
I was caught, sold for a slave... and branded on the cheek with the letter "S".
"S" for slave!
An English slave.
Understand? An English slave.
The most contemptuous title any Englishman can bear... still conferred by English law.
But I'll be relieved of it.
One day I'll be caught and hanged.
You shall not!
Furthermore, on this day, that law is ended.
What's that?
Who is this?
I am Edward, King of England.
You mannerless vagrants.
Is this the thanks I get for the royal boon I have promised?
He's my son and stark mad.
Thinks he's King.
I am the King.
As you, a confessed murderer, shall soon learn on the gallows!
You'd try your own father, will you?
If you have no respect for your king, have some for the Ruffler... or I'll teach you respect at the end of a rope.
Now, lad, if you must be king... humor yourself, but not as King of England.
It's treason, and we'll have none of that here.
We may be a scurvy lot... but at least we're scurvy Englishmen, and loyal to the Crown.
God bless Edward, King of England!
I thank you, my good people.
Drop it, I said.
Choose yourself another handle.
- Foo-Foo the First!
- King of mooncalves!
Here you are! Your robe, sire!
- A crown!
- Here's one.
He's disappeared, plain and simple.
Why should His Grace still be worried about him?
Because it would put England in revolt and half its head on the chopping block... should there be two Edwards at the coronation tomorrow.
What's that to us? We're still the King's Guard, whether the King is...
Edward or Bobo the butcher boy.
One o'clock and all's well!
Drink up and be off to your rooms.
It's closing time. Come on.
That's good advice.
You'll be on the road at sunrise. Up!
Right, sir.
About three more swallows will do it.
Take your time, sir.
I wouldn't want you to get the hiccups.
No. They're noisy things.
Here's to the end of your long day.
It'd be a pleasure to get you another, sir.
Would it? But how about your sleep?
I can manage to keep my eyes open.
Especially when there's something handsome to look at.
Are you staying the night?
- No. Worse luck.
- Why not?
- The curse of money, my dear.
- You mean you're strapped?
I only wish I were.
Then I couldn't have flipped that coin.
- But where are you going?
- A place called the Roost, near here.
That thieves' den?
But you're not going there at this time of night?
You'll have your throat cut sure.
They'll commit murder for a penny.
It looks bad for me with my shilling.
Remember, if you don't do like you've been told... we'll put climes on you.
Twenty of them.
You know what climes are?
Tell him, Hugo.
They're little bandages with a bit of paste on them... made of soap and quicklime and rust off old iron.
And when you take some off, there's the nastiest looking sore... that ever made a citizen sick.
Sores that don't get well, but spread like a disease.
No.
I'll steal.
Let's get at it, then.
Help! Murder! Call the watch!
Stop!
Where'd they go?
Help!
Who was that?
Murder!
Boy, stop. It is I, Miles Hendon.
What happened there?
- I've been murdered.
- Murdered?
They killed me.
- All right, what happened?
- I don't know.
You don't know? I have a pretty fair idea.
You got into the room and didn't do what you was told.
Now you'll get what's coming to you.
I'm deeply grateful to you, Sir Miles.
You certainly make some delightful acquaintances.
Is he dead?
I don't anticipate hearing an apology from him much before Judgment Day.
It is just. He was a confessed murderer.
Come. I wish to be gone from here.
What have you been doing since I last saw you?
Learning a great deal about England.
- It doesn't seem to please you.
- No, it doesn't.
- Hold or I'll fire!
- That's them.
No doubt! What are they doing about this time of night?
String 'em both up.
- Stop that! What would you with us?
- You're under arrest for robbery.
We know nothing of any robbery.
We'll take you back to the Running Fox.
We'll find out soon enough.
- They're the thieves, all right.
- No doubt of it.
All right, here they are. We nabbed them.
No, sir. It wasn't this gentleman, sir.
I happen to know it was otherwise...
You speak when you're spoke to.
If you can recognize them... they'll soon be on their way to learn it's harder to break out than in.
I can recognize them. Just point them out.
Get over there.
I can identify him.
He was the one with the musket.
No, sir. I was the one that led the cavalry charge. Don't you remember?
My dapper friend, you'd be more respectful lashed to a whipping post.
You, my fat friend, would look more natural tied to a hitching post.
- Where are all the others?
- All the others is him.
He's right here, sir.
It's him.
His Majesty.
- Get the horses ready.
- Right, sir.
- It's he. I'm positive.
- Take your hands from me, pig!
- Pig? I'll teach you.
- What?
- You're a pretty pair of cutthroats.
- Take them away.
One moment.
- We'll take charge of the boy.
- Captain, l...
And who might you be to be taking charge of my prisoner?
The Captain of His Majesty's Guard.
Let's see that.
The boy has escaped from a London madhouse.
And has a strange insanity offensive to the Crown.
Naturally, this is our responsibility.
Yes, sir. Of course, sir. Your prisoner, sir.
Take him along.
- Glad to have been of service, Captain.
- Good night.
Captain, what do you suggest doing with this one, sir?
He seems capable of digesting about 20 lashes.
Thank you, Captain.
When next we meet, I trust you'll be capable of digesting 20 inches of steel.
Here.
How dare you indulge this outrage on my person?
It wouldn't do to let people know there's been no king on the throne... until the day before the coronation.
Forgive me. It was the best ruse I knew to get you away.
But what of the man Hendon?
I want him freed.
He shall be in the morning.
Tonight we get closer to London to arrive in time tomorrow.
Very well.
But should any harm come to Miles Hendon, your life shall pay for it.
- Understand?
- Yes, Your Majesty. My life.
- Why are we stopping here, Captain?
- To let you get some sleep, Your Majesty.
I felt my making camp for a few hours... would freshen you for the coronation ceremonies in the morning.
Very considerate, Captain. I am sleepy.
This way, Your Majesty.
This place will be ideal.
May I have your cloak, Captain?
Give me your cloak.
- Forgive me, Your Majesty.
- What have you done?
It's what I must do, poor little Edward.
Is that any way to address your King?
Or for the Captain of my Guard to act?
Cowering like a woman?
Out with it, fellow. What is it?
You are to join your father, Your Majesty.
You're going to kill me?
You can't.
You just can't.
There's no one to take the throne, except Mary or Elizabeth.
And they're girls and not even grown up.
Say your prayers, Your Majesty.
I hope my father's asleep in heaven.
I don't want him to know that a Tudor died at the hands of a traitorous Englishman.
He'd be so ashamed of you.
But he won't be ashamed of me.
"Our father, who art in heaven...
"hallowed be thy name.
"Thy kingdom come...
"thy will be done...
"on earth as it is in heaven."
And me what calls myself an Englishman.
Be still, can't you?
"Forgive us our trespasses...
"as we forgive those who trespass against us.
"Lead us not into temptation...
"but deliver us from evil."
How's your digestion now, Captain?
Ready for that 20 inches of steel
I promised you?
Miles Hendon!
- Your Majesty.
- Majesty?
- Then you believe me?
- Without a doubt, sire.
What's the matter?
I was frightened.
Sirs, here I present King Edward... rightful and undoubted inheritor by the laws of God and man... to the royal dignity and crown imperial of this realm... whose consecration, inunction, and coronation... is appointed to be this day.
Will ye nobles, peers, and commons serve at this time... and give your good wills in a sense... to the same consecration, inunction, and coronation... as by your duty ye are bound to do?
Yes!
Smile, you little fool.
Smile and bow to them.
O God, who dwellest in the high and holy place... with them also who are of a humble spirit...
Look down mercifully upon this, thy servant Edward, our King... here humbling himself before thee at thy footstool... and graciously receive these oblations... which in humble acknowledgment of thy sovereignty over all... and of thy great bounty to him in particular... he hath offered up unto thee... through Jesus Christ, our only mediator and advocate.
Amen.
Will you, Edward, grant to the people of England... the laws and liberties of this realm?
"I do grant and so promise."
Will you keep to the Church and people holy peace and concord?
"I shall keep."
Will you make to be done to the best of your strength and power... equal and rightful justice in all your dooms and judgments with mercy and truth?
"I shall do."
The things which I have here before promised I will perform and keep.
So help me God and the contents of this book.
Kiss the book.
Let these hands be anointed with holy oil.
Let this breast... be anointed with holy oil.
And let this head be anointed with holy oil.
As kings and prophets were anointed... and as Samuel did anoint David to be king.
So that thou mayest be blessed and established... a king in this kingdom, over this people... whom the Lord thy God have given thee to rule and govern.
Amen.
O Lord... who receivest thy good and faithful servants... with mercy and loving kindness...
Look down upon this, thy servant Edward, our King...
- Get out of here.
- Look here, my good fellow...
Something of the utmost importance to the entire realm has arisen...
You'll have your ears taken off if you don't go.
- I demand to speak to your captain.
- He'll give you 40 lashes.
...having a right faith and manifold fruit of good works... mayest obtain the crown of an everlasting Kingdom.
Stop!
What is this?
What is he doing?
Stop! I forbid it.
Who dares this sacrilege?
I, Edward, the King.
Truly, he is the King.
His Majesty's malady is upon him again.
- Seize the impostor.
- Hold!
O my lord and King, forgive me.
What you have done is shameful treason.
It wasn't my doing, Your Majesty.
Cross my heart.
I believe you, Tom Canty.
But others shall answer.
- Outrage...
- Softly.
Your Majesty, perhaps we could proceed with the coronation... if you were assured no harm would come to this lad.
What a striking resemblance.
Some of you have already forfeited your heads.
But others may be spared by paying homage now.
Please, milord. Please believe us.
Truly, he is the King.
By your favor, sire, might I ask some questions... which may allay our doubts?
I command you to do so, that I may answer them... and end your stupid perplexity.
What stands near the right-hand door of our late King's apartment?
The Great Herring.
A model of the warship designed by my late father.
God rest his soul.
Of what did Lady Jane eat so many that she became...
- discommoded?
- Pomegranates.
And got ill on the Steward of the Household.
Which man did you wrongly but affectionately call uncle?
Milord Norfolk, whose absence displeases me.
- All these things are true, milord.
- Unbelievably.
Astonishing.
Quite astonishing indeed, but the King can do the same. They are not proofs.
It is perilous to the state and to us all, to entertain such a mystery as this.
It could undermine the throne, divide the nation.
- Arrest this...
- One moment.
The mystery may be easily solved.
There's one question which only the Prince of Wales can answer.
- Where is the Great Seal of England?
- That'll settle it.
I must have put it with all things of value which had been entrusted to me.
Of course. Milord St. John... go to my private cabinet.
Close to the floor in the left corner is a nailhead.
Press it and a jeweled closet will fly open.
There you will find the Great Seal. Fetch it.
- At once!
- And do hurry.
Yes, Your Majesty.
- Your mount, Captain!
- Yes, milord.
The seal, Your Majesty, is not there.
Cast this beggar into the streets.
Stone the impostor. Take him away.
Let him alone!
Please, sir. Maybe His Majesty has just misplaced the seal.
- He might have, mightn't he?
- Hardly likely, sire.
A massive golden disk isn't a thing to escape notice.
Was it round and thick?
And did it have letters carved in it?
That would describe it, my liege.
Blimey. So that's the thing that's been worrying everybody.
If you'd described it to me, you could have had it sooner.
Your Majesty, knowing where the great seal lies... does nothing to establish this lad's spurious claim.
Perhaps we'd better continue the ceremony.
But with the real King, because he put away the seal himself.
Remember, Your Majesty?
You must. You've got to be king.
Because I wouldn't like it anymore.
Think.
I just can't.
- It seems so long ago.
- We exchanged clothes, you remember?
That I'll never forget.
And you asked me if I knew any games, and I said, Constable.
And you went out to get your dog.
But before you left, what did you do?
Think.
- Harder, Your Majesty.
- I just can't.
Listen, and try and see it.
You started for the door.
You passed a table.
That old thing you called a seal was on it.
You picked it up and looked about for some place to hide it.
Your eyes caught sight of...
The suit of armor by the door, in the leg-piece.
Your Majesty. Coming through.
- Your mount again, Captain?
- Yes, sir.
He's a busy bloke, ain't he?
Come here, lad.
Yes, Your Majesty?
I owe my throne to you, Tom.
A debt which I shall pay.
But tell me, how could you remember where I hid the seal... when I couldn't myself?
You see, Your Majesty,
I found it and used it.
Used it? For what?
To crack nuts with.
My father told me the night he died... that a wise king removes the heads of those... who try to remove the crown.
But I suppose I'm not a wise king.
Because I don't want you to be killed.
Instead, I hereby order you to be banished from England... for the rest of your life.
May I learn generosity from you, sire.
The acts, Your Majesty.
Milords and ladies, my dad...
I mean, the late King... told me to use the Great Seal sparingly in making laws.
But if he had gone out among his people without his crown...
I know he'd have told me not to spare it in breaking them.
So these acts abolish the begging laws... modify the laws of eminent domain, and do away with slavery.
Churl, you dare sit in the presence of your King?
Yes. But you mustn't.
- Your Majesty!
- Let's not take affront.
It is his right, afforded by a grateful King, whose life he saved.
- Also, Sir Miles Hendon...
- Yes, sire?
There is among these papers a commission for you.
- As Captain of my Guard.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
You aren't pleased by my appointment?
You see, Your Majesty, the enemy will never come to Windsor.
And a Captain of the Guard can't go looking for them.
So, as my trade's soldiering, I don't see when I'll get a chance to practice it.
Very well.
- But I owe you something.
- Three crowns to be exact, sire.
You shall have them. A hundredfold.
Yes, and an earldom, castles, lands...
- and a retinue of servants.
- Your Majesty.
I hope Your Majesty won't think me ungrateful... but please may I be permitted to forgo all these honors... with which Your Majesty threatens me?
To one of my temperament, riches are a curse.
Possessions, a veritable scourge.
All I ask is an obscure life and a peaceful one.
But not too peaceful, of course.
Anything to content you, Sir Miles.
But remember, I'm eternally in your debt.
I'll seal these, and you may send for them later.
- Please dismiss the court.
- Yes, sire.
You have His Majesty's permission to withdraw.
- Tom.
- Yes, Your Highness?
- Come here.
- Yes, sire.
They're gone.
Sit down.
Are you sure it's all right?
You sat down all the time you were King, so I suppose it won't matter now.
- This one's about you.
- Me?
- It makes you my ward.
- Ward?
That means all your life you'll have money to live on.
And if anybody's unkind or cruel to you... they've committed an offense against the Crown.
- Oh, Your Majesty.
- What's the matter?
- I just don't know what to say.
- Just say thank you.
This is good for cracking nuts, isn't it?

And it was there that Daniel Webster got the stern and intellectual training of the lawyer.
Got the training... that made him see...
...made him see things clearly and logically. until victory finally crowned his efforts.
And... because he saw things clearly and logically... victory crowned his efforts.
And then there was another important thing about him.
About Daniel Webster, I mean.
And that was that...
And then he...
In the matter of the National Bank.
In the matter of the National Bank... he opposed it forcibly on the grounds that... that there wasn't enough behind the species...
And uh... because of the... of the... untiring and ceaseless efforts of that clear and logical lawyer our Junior High of Manson got its name and inspiration.
I thank you.
Did I leave anything out, Uncle Joe?
Just most of the middle and the whole point.
I thought you were wonderful.
I'm quite sure I voice the opinion of you all when I say that our Herbert Mitchell has made a most unusual speech.
Or should I become a little more informal and call him Buzz.
The name which he has gained since coming to this community from his native Canada.
Yes, I shall. Buzz Mitchell.
An excellent speech, Master Buzz, though I confess you did confuse me a little about the banking problem.
But then, I'm only a banker and not a prospective lawyer, like you.
Yip, yip, yip, yip.
Before announcing the next artist on the program
I want to extend our heartfelt thanks to a little woman who has done much for Manson.
In her civic activities, by the example she sets in her home life her commendable fortitude in adversity she's a credit to our fair city.
She always has given of her time and energy much more than her widow's might.
Mrs Dorothy Wingate.
And more than that, my friends,
Mrs Wingate has also given us the next artist on our program the little American nightingale,
Miss Pinkie Wingate.
Dear, when you smiled at me
I heard a melody
It haunted me from the start.
Something inside of me started a symphony, zing went the strings of my heart.
Just like the breath of spring,
I heard a robin sing about a nest set apart.
All nature seemed to be in perfect harmony zing went this strings of my heart.
Your eyes made skies seem blue again
What else could I do again but keep repeating through and through
I love you, love you.
I still recall a thrill
I guess I always will
I hoped would never depart.
I knew I loved you heaps and you were mine for keeps
Zing went the strings of my heart.
Your eyes made skies seem blue again
What else could I do again but keep repeating through and through
I love you, love you.
I still recall the thrill
I guess I always will
I hoped would never depart.
I knew I loved you heaps and you were mine for keeps
Zing went the strings of my heart.
If the future of Manson depends on some of the stuff I heard in there we're doomed for some long, lean years.
But Uncle Joe, I knew the whole thing...
There's Mrs Wingate.
Go on and square yourself with her.
Gosh, Dottie, I knew it word for word
when I said it to you the other night, didn't I?
I thought it was very good, Buzz.
Didn't you, Mrs Higgins?
It was all right.
Of course it was.
Ahh...
Ahh.
A delightful song, Pinkie, and a delightful voice.
We'll have to see that that voice gets training, eh?
Aren't you going to thank Mr Drubbs,
Pinkie?
Thank you.
Come along, dear.
I want to talk to Buzz first.
All right, but don't be late.
Bring Buzz home for dinner, if you want to.
Good bye.
If it hadn't been for Mr Drubbs
I bet I wouldn't have forgotten it.
He was staring at me every time I looked around.
Gee, I know what I forgot.
Not only in the matter of the defeat of paper currency Bank did victory crown his efforts but also in the area of free trade, too...
And I don't want you to rush into anything if you aren't sure, Dottie.
Take your time. Think it over some more.
I realize that perhaps I don't have much to offer a woman like you. but if you can see your way clear...
I'll do my best to make you happy.
I know you would, Arthur.
But I have so many problems right now...
The children?
I'd do anything in the world for them.
I love those kids.
Ouch!
Billy Wingate!
Are you still sure you want to take on the Wingate family?
Dead sure.
You will think it over, won't you?
Yes... yes, I will.
I'll think it over.
It's been a nice afternoon.
Good bye.
Good bye.
Billy, stop fooling now and eat your cereal.
But Daniel Boone didn't eat cereal.
Billie!
Aw, gee, it's the first day of vacation.
Well, all right, but tomorrow.
Guess I'll go kill a few Indians.
It's a nice sunny day to start a vacation.
Toast, dear?
Oh, yes, toast.
Gee, Dottie, I wish I had a job.
What?
Didn't you sleep well, dear?
It'd be just like when we used to have so much fun.
Remember, even the time I frowned
Daddy said we'd have to go and celebrate.
And he had finished the trailer we left the breakfast dishes and went away and stayed for a week.
We wouldn't have to sell the trailer and we could go anyplace...
Pinkie, what are you talking about?
I'd be making plenty of money and you wouldn't have to worry about anything at all.
We could get the taxes paid up, and the roof fixed and you could have a lot of new clothes like you used to have.
Oh, Pinkie, you're sweet, but you aren't going to work.
You're going to have a nice, long vacation.
And in the fall you're going to Millicent School and you're going to have that voice trained properly.
But Dottie, I...
Listen, dear... when I was your age
I didn't learn much, except well, how to wash dishes, how to bake a shortcake, that sort of thing.
When an emergency came,
I wasn't prepared to meet it.
You're never going to be in that position.
You're going to have the best kind of independence.
I don't mean money.
I mean the ability to do something for yourself.
That's why training your voice is so important.
But...
Pinkie, what are you trying to say?
Well...
It's just...
Dottie...
If there was anybody else in this family besides us
I mean, besides you, and Billie and me...
It wouldn't be like the same family.
I mean...
You wouldn't...
Pinkie...
Don't you think I want what's best for all of us?
When you and Billy have everything that Daddy wanted for you I'll be so happy.
Why, you're just beginning.
Won't you trust me, dear?
Yes, mother.
Gee, I love you, Dottie.
Fill 'er up, Joe, and check the tires,
I'll be back in a minute.
Gosh, Pinkie, don't.
Please don't.
Look, maybe she won't marry him after all.
But she will.
I know she will.
Then he'll sit there in Daddy's chair and go ha-ha-ha.
Oh, Buzz, I can't stand it.
Well, gosh...
You gotta go with this clearly, logically.
But she's unhappy, I know she's unhappy.
'Cause she cried again last night.
And she'll go on crying.
Before she used to laugh all the time.
If Daddy were only here he'd do something.
Well, I'll do something, Pinkie.
What?
Well, I'll go over and talk to her.
That won't do any good, Buzz.
Well, I...
Maybe we could sue.
Sue?
Dottie?
No, no, Drubbs.
Could we, Buzz?
What for?
Oh, I... there must be plenty of things,
I mean...
Just a minute.
Section 233
What is it, Buzz?
I think I've got something here.
Buzz...
I've gotta get an outside opinion.
Pinkie, you wait here.
Buzz!
Buzz...
If you wanted to take a fellow out of town for a few days that mightn't want to go but you knew it was the best thing for him...
Buzz...
They couldn't put you in jail for that, could they?
Maybe.
Supposing it was a relation.
Like the time Mrs Selfridge took her daughter Mabel to Europe so she couldn't marry that Pickering fellow.
Well, they couldn't put you in jail for that, could they?
No, they couldn't arrest you for that.
Supposing it was a case like that?
Say...
When Mabel came back, she didn't want to marry that guy at all, did she?
Let me do that, Uncle Joe.
Listen. If I took a fellow fishing for a couple of days... could I borrow the Model "A"?
Yep.
But don't you think the fellow would be more comfortable if you borrowed the Wingate trailer?
Gee!
Buzz.
Thought about how you aim to feed this fellow, Buzz?
Whereas you look all tuckered out from your first day's work, Buzz and... whereas the fishing will be pretty good right now.
Looks to me whereas I'm cooked for a raise in advance.
Not that I think it will do any good, mind you... but it's worth it just to get a look at old Drubbs' face.
Uncle Joe.
I bet that old windbag will wanna shoot me for this...
Pinkie, dinner's almost ready.
What?
I wish you'd come downstairs so I wouldn't have to shout at you.
I can't come down.
Never mind, I'll be up.
Oh, no!
I'll be down.
Right down.
They're ready.
Look out!
Let it go.
Now, listen, Billie, you...
What're you doing with Pinkie's clothes, stealing?
I know, you're eloping.
Pinkie and Buzz are eloping!
Pinkie and Buzz are eloping.
Shut up and I'll give you my three-bladed jackknife.
Pinkie and Buzz are eloping.
I'll give you my carbine shell, too.
Huh? Where is it?
I haven't got it with me, but I have got something you want.
What?
Rats.
Where?
Right in there in a cage.
Red-eyed rats?
Sure, come and see for yourself.
Jiminy Crickets
Buzz! Buzz!
Drubbs is coming down the road.
Hey, Dottie, Dottie!
Hello, Buzz.
What was all that noise outside?
Somebody moving in next door?
No, that was me. I've got the trailer here.
A man says he wants to buy it.
Says he'll give you $50 for it, too.
Really, Buzz?
Oh, wait till I get this roast out of here.
You'd better come right away.
He might go away. He´s that kind of a fellow.
Come on, Dottie, hurry.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Oh, I look awful.
No you don't, come on now, Dottie.
Dottie, help, let me out!
Dottie, let me out.
Billy.
Dottie, help, let me out.
Baby, how did you get in there?
I'll shoot that ol' Buzz so hard that he won't be able to sit down for a week.
Rats! That liar.
What is all this?
Buzz! Buzz, let me out of here.
Pinkie, Pinkie. Do you here me?
She's pounding on the window, Buzz.
Don't pay any attention.
Gosh, Buzz, maybe we've gone too far, huh?
We've gone too far to back down now.
We're only as far as the old lumber mill.
Come on, Buzz, we'd better turn back.
For Pete's sakes.
Take her back to marry Drubbs?
Oh, no. No.
Then sit tight and quit yapping.
Now, now, don't, Pinkie, don't.
What do you want me to do?
Give it all up?
Let her marry Drubbs?
Oh, Buzz, please stop.
Please.
Oh, Buzz, you're a darling.
Wait a minute, Pinkie.
We've got to talk. I'm gonna do it.
I'm not gonna have you gumming this thing up too so as we're back where we started.
But...
Oh, all right, Buzz.
Dottie! Are you in there?
You know perfectly well I am, Buzz.
Let me out of here this second.
Open up, Buzz, or I'll shoot your ugly head off.
Open up, I said.
Listen, Dottie, please don't be angry and treat us like children.
We thought this whole thing out very carefully and it's for your own good.
Will you open this door.
Listen, Dottie... we just want you to promise something first.
Now, in the event that we must return to town... and we'll do that only if you promise us a certain thing.
It's in your own interest, I assure you.
Will you promise if I open the door?
Dottie. Can you hear me?
Dottie.
Mrs Wingate.
Now listen, we know you're in there.
Open it, Buzz.
I might as well try and reason with a piece of cheese as women.
What's the idea of locking us in that trailer?
Billie, be quiet.
I'm sorry.
Dottie.
Now what have you to say for yourselves?
It's simply this way, Mrs Wingate.
We just wanted to protect you.
By throwing me into a trailer and locking me in and then driving into this ordeal and nearly knocking my teeth out.
Dottie, we didn't mean to.
Are you hurt?
Well, what did you mean then?
What is the meaning of this?
We only wanted... only so you could get away and... not have to worry about money and... not have to marry people or anything.
Honestly, Dottie.
I know you do, even though you say you don't.
I hear you crying at nights after we're in bed.
Dottie, I don't want you to have to marry anybody just because you want a new roof or you want me to go to school or... you want to get Billie's teeth straightened or anything.
Honestly, even if we have to live in a trailer for the rest of our lives.
It would be wonderful, honest it would.
It doesn't cost much to live in a trailer and... we could travel for months and months and... eat hamburgers and...
Buzz...
I think the two of you are mad.
Absolutely mad.
It's the craziest, silliest, most ridiculous, senseless thing
I've ever heard of in my whole life.
But I love you for it.
There's a road that leads to happiness
I know we can find it.
Although it's full of hills and spills darling, we won't mind it.
I got you, you got me who cares how rough the road may be
We'll go bumpty, bumpty, bumpty bump on the bumpy road to love.
Side by side, we'll go far, who cares how many bumps there are
We'll go bumpty, bumpty, bumpty bump on the bumpy road to love.
Remember this when anything goes wrong
Remember this, we'll merrily roll along.
We'll get rich or we won't
Who cares whether we do or don't
We'll go bumpty, bumpty, bumpty bump on the bumpy road to love.
Let's all join in and sing this tune
Dottie, Buzz, and Daniel Boone
We'll go bumpty, bump, bumpty bump on the bumpy road to love.
Hi-ho, what do we care
We're on our way but we don't know where
We'll go bumpty, bumpty, bumpty bump on the bumpy road to love.
We'll never need silver linings for we'll never ever have a cloud
Give three cheers for four musketeers...
Only four?
Just four.
Just four?
No more.
For five would be a crowd, yes!
Rah-rah-rah.
Sis-boom-ba
Hey diddle-diddle
And Ooh-la-la.
We'll go bumpty-bump, bumpty-bump we'll go bumpty, bumpty, bumpty bump on the bumpy road to love.
Hail, hail, the gang's all here
Our home sweet home is in the rear
Bumpty, bumpty, bumpty bump on the bumpy road to love.
I got a long one,
I got a long one!
So did I.
Well, it looks like you and I will have to wash the dishes, Buzz.
Gosh, this is the third time in a row for me.
Oh, that's too bad.
Pinkie, you take Billie and run back to that farmhouse we passed this evening and see if you can get some milk for breakfast.
Okay.
Come on, Bill.
Pretty soon we'll be back in Manson,
Buzz.
With the same problems to face that we left behind.
Some things are rather hard for a woman to face all alone, Buzz.
I wish you'd give me some advice.
Well, that's what I'm here for, Dottie.
That's my business.
It's about Pinkie. I had no idea she felt so strongly about certain things.
I can hardly talk to her when she's so upset.
It's like pulling teeth sometimes to get her to listen to reason.
But you understand her so well, Buzz.
I thought you might help me with her.
I...
I don't quite understand this terrible dislike she has for poor Mr Drubbs.
That's only because she doesn't want you to marry anybody that you don't like, Dottie.
But I do like him, Buzz.
He's a very kind, unselfish man.
You mean you really want to marry him?
I'm going to marry him, Buzz.
Gee.
Then you really love him after all, huh?
Well, you see, Buzz, there are many different kinds of love.
It wouldn't be the same kind of love
I had for their father, Buzz.
That was wonderful.
But I'm older now.
A woman wants to keep her home around her children, have someone help her with problems she can't face alone.
Daddy was so happy-go-lucky he wouldn't worry a moment about the future.
He didn't even believe in insurance.
But everyone believes in insurance.
He didn't.
He thought everyone should get as much fun out of money as possible.
Just going on from day to day.
But that's sheer lack of foresight, Dottie.
Why, even I saved up $7.50.
Exactly, Buzz.
You can see I'm doing the right thing,
Buzz.
From a completely unprejudiced viewpoint,
Dottie,
I'd say you were doing absolutely the right thing.
Then if you could only make
Pinkie see it.
Pinkie just needs handling.
Ixnay, ixnay, attunday
Oh...
Hello, Pinkie.
Where's the milk?
Yeah, didn't you get the milk, Pinkie?
We got it all right, we almost had it home till mister smarty Buffalo Bill Wingate started to play Pony Express with it.
If she'd given me the milk bucket I wouldn't have had to grab it from her, would I?
I she hadn't of hung on to it when I came galloping past...
It's all right, Billie.
Only I'm afraid we won't have your flapjacks for breakfast.
Aw, Dottie! Gee, no flapjacks?
Now look what you went and done.
Buzz.
Buzz, wake up.
Buzz, it's me, Pinkie.
What is it?
I gotta talk to you.
Are you sick?
Shh... no.
I just got a question I had to ask you.
Come here.
For Pete's sake. Why can't you keep your questions till morning?
Instead of waking a man from a good night's sleep.
I just had to.
I just couldn't sleep.
I kept wondering.
Was Dottie talking to you about Drubbs when you were washing the dishes?
Now listen, Why do you wanna go jumping to conclusions for?
Listen, she didn't say a thing.
She was.
I can tell by the way you say she wasn't.
Oh, Buzz, she isn't still gonna marry him, is she?
Pinkie, listen.
Suppose she wanted to marry him.
But she couldn't.
She couldn't love anybody but Daddy.
That's all you know.
Well, not in the same way, maybe, but...
You're not taking into consideration all those other kinds of love.
What other kinds?
Well... when people get older... naturally they want to keep a home for their children, have peace and not have burdens on their shoulders.
If a guy comes along and wanted to help those children, naturally she'd have to love him in a way, wouldn't she?
Particularly if he carried good insurance.
Maybe, but...
I don't know how you could do better than Drubbs in the whole town of Manson.
If we aren't dumb.
I see plenty of other guys.
Guys both of you would like.
You know very well the only men in town that aren't married are old Mr Grant, Mr Farnswick and the barber.
Who said anything about in town?
We're out on the open road now.
We can meet anyone out here.
Up to the President of the United States.
What good would that do?
He's married.
Listen, if I found one that wasn't married and that was rich and everything and that both you and Dottie were crazy about... well, you'd like him better than Drubbs, wouldn't you?
I'd like anybody better than Drubbs.
Well, she'll go back and marry him for sure unless we find the right guy.
I'm gonna start out tomorrow and find him.
But, Buzz, people just don't go out and find husbands.
For the sole and only reason that they haven't the initiative, that's why.
Boy, I bet I can find one that'll make old Drubbs look sick.
Boy, I bet this is the solution to the whole darn thing.
Once and for all.
Listen, you know what we're gonna do?
We're gonna wake up good and early in the morning and hit the old road.
Isn't it beautiful, Buzz?
You know, I could settle down here and spend the rest of our time right in this very spot.
Oh, gosh, Dottie, no.
We gotta get out on that open road and see what the country has to offer.
I mean, Pinkie and I were saying just last night that we couldn't get started early enough this morning.
For a girl who couldn't get started early enough,
Pinkie is taking a long time getting dressed.
Hurry up, darling.
Buzz wants to get started.
I don't see what all the rush is about anyway.
You can't sit up half the night and...
But you got to bed at 9 o'clock.
Gosh, you must have been dreaming,
Pinkie.
Yes, I guess I was.
When did that trailer get here?
Oh, it drove in early this morning.
Breakfast is almost ready, dear.
You help Buzz with the table.
For Pete's sakes. Don't go giving things away the minute I think of them.
It all looks kind of crazy in the daylight, anyway.
Is it as crazy as Drubbs?
No.
All right, then.
We gotta get started with this thing right after breakfast.
Pinkie, is the salt on the table?
No, it must be in the cupboard, Dottie.
I can't find it anywhere.
Oh, Billie has it.
He went out to catch some birds.
Find him, Pinkie. I want Buzz to help me.
Oh, he's always going off and I have to chase after him...
Buzz, I need that salt right away.
Run over to that other trailer and ask them if they'll lend us some, will you, dear?
Okay, Dottie.
Hey, is anybody in here?
Get away from that tent flap.
What do you want?
Some salt.
Are you sure that flap's down?
Yeah, yeah, sure.
All right, whoever you are, the salt is in a can in front of you on a shelf as you come in that door.
Take the whole can, but watch that flap on the way out.
For the love of heaven, watch that flap.
Okay, I will, okay.
Close the door!
Shut it quick!
Holy smoke!
All he said was, "Watch that flap".
Hey, hold it.
You haven't used this stuff, have you?
Yes, but I don't think I'll use the eggs.
I don't like potassium bromide on eggs.
Thank heaven you knew what it was.
Luckily my husband used to use it for photography.
Really?
Although he never found it very satisfactory.
Is that so? Well, I find it quite satisfactory whenever I use it.
Maybe he used the wrong proportions.
Perhaps he didn't keep the plates cold enough.
Now, I keep my plates in a specially built refrigerator, you see, and...
I'm sorry, there I go again.
I almost poisoned you, but don't let me bore you to death.
Say, this is quite a trailer you've got here.
What's that?
Oh, that's for the water.
How do you work it?
That works like a tap pump.
You push this down... and that builds up the pressure in the tank there... forces water along and then you turn the fawcet.
Don't they think of the screwiest gadgets...
It was an invention of my husband's.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Not at all. It is a bit complicated.
Rather ingenious, though.
This must be rather an early vintage, isn't it?
Pioneer.
I'd like to show you a few improvements that I've devised for mine to conserve space.
Would you care to step over and see?
Come on, Dottie, let's.
Well, as long as we can't eat the eggs.
That is a shame.
I've got a half a dozen over there you can have and I'll give you some real salt.
All right.
After you, lad.
Hey, look out.
Wow, you need some ballast for that.
I want you to see this.
I'm rather proud of this one.
My shower.
How very handy.
And very practical, too.
Hot and cold running water and here is the water for the sink.
That is a convenience.
I've never seen anything like it.
How do you like it, lad?
Oh, what's that?
That won't bite you, now.
That is my robot refrigerator unit.
That's wonderful.
Here are the eggs.
Oh, I really couldn't.
You must, now take it.
And here's some real salt.
Thank you so much, and sorry for being such a bother.
No bother at all.
Come on, Buzz.
In just a minute.
All right.
That's a very lovely mother you have there.
Dottie's Pinkie's.
Huh?
She's very nice, too.
Yes, I'm sure.
My, this place must have cost quite a lot, eh?
It did.
Is that where your family sleep?
No, I haven't a family.
That's my darkroom for photography.
A fellow I know in Manson does a lot of photography.
Really?
Good money in it since this magazine boom, eh?
Yes, there seems to be.
Is this your work?
Hm-hmm.
Very pretty.
Isn't she?
It's...
It's nice to be able to take pictures of your loved ones, isn't it?
Yeah, but that's a professional model.
Oh.
Got any pictures of the girl you're engaged to?
No, I'm sorry to say I haven't.
And you know, I...
I hate to confess this to you, with your romantic nature... but I'm not engaged to a soul.
Oh, that's all right.
That's fine.
You're not a woman hater, are you?
Do I look like one?
Oh, no, I just thought I'd ask.
Seeing that there's so much talk about women, pro and con...
Oh, yes, of course.
Now, personally...
I think there's nothing like married life.
Have you been married a long time?
Huh?
I just mean, since I've been around Dottie.
Mrs Wingate, there.
Oh, yes, I understand.
I can see all I miss.
It's just Uncle Joe in the gas station.
You own a home of your own somewheres?
No, I regret to say that I just lease a New York apartment.
They cost plenty, don't they?
Yes, plenty.
Still, I guess with the photography boom money's a small item.
I bet I couldn't begin to guess the amount of money you've made out of photography in, say, the last year.
Are you thinking of taking it up?
Well, if you can make it hand over fist like you're doing.
I mean, if you'd just give me a rough idea...
I haven't made a red cent out of photography. It's just a hobby with me.
Oh, hobby, eh?
Hm-hmm.
Expensive hobby.
Somewhat.
Your real work must be something then.
Say, would it disillusion you terribly to learn that I practice law?
Law?
Now wait a minute, don't take it so much to heart.
I'm liable to make a dollar or two out of this thing...
I think it's wonderful you're a lawyer,
I think it's simply swell.
Then everything's all right.
Say, will you tell me something?
Sure, anything.
Never in all my life have I had such concentrated and flattering interest in my romantic, professional and financial affairs.
What is it that fascinates you so?
Huh?
Well, gosh, it's natural, isn't it?
Considering that I'm sort of practicing law myself.
I mean, practicing practicing.
Oh, then that accounts for the cross-examination.
All the time I've been thinking you were a detective and instead of that you're a great legal mind.
You really think I've got talent?
Genius, positive genius.
Boy, thanks.
Gee.
Well, I guess I oughta be getting back.
Dottie'll be waiting. Dottie's so swell
I wouldn't want her to worry.
That wouldn't do.
Well...
Why don't you come over to dinner and taste her cooking?
Thank you.
Well...
I've never enjoyed meeting anyone so much in all my life.
The pleasure's been mine.
Well...
See you later.
I hope so.
See you later.
Be back about the dinner.
I know. Watch your head there on your way out.
Bye.
Good bye.
Now, where under the sun could we find such a beautiful spot again, Dottie?
Let's stay here.
But you just said you and Pinkie...
After all it's your holiday and one place is as good as another to us.
Except this one is better even.
Well, all right, Buzz.
Gee, I think that guy is swell, don't you, Dottie?
Yes, he's very nice.
I didn't think anyone could be as enthusiastic about his trailer as Daddy was.
And those inventions.
He's a lawyer, too.
Oh, that's what kept you over there so long, huh?
Look, Dottie...
If you invited him over to dinner we could talk over some more...
Hey, for Pete's sakes...
Gosh, he's going.
Hey, you aren't going, are you?
Yep. Good luck to you.
Hope to see you along the road.
Dottie, we gotta get out of here, too, quick.
Buzz, just because he's a lawyer doesn't mean you can pursue the poor man the way you did Mr Fleming.
But he said I was a genius, Dottie.
Dottie, it's a matter of life and death to me.
Listen, Dottie. Please, please...
You'll never regret it.
If it means so much to you, all right.
Shame on you, Billie, you bad boy...
What in the world?
That famous old beaver trapper,
Mister smarty Bill Wingate fell into a beaver trap...
Stop, stop children.
Get those clothes off immediately.
Come on in.
Yeah, hurry, we gotta get started.
I found him!
I tell you, I found him!
Huh? Who, the beaver?
Well, let me tell you, Buzz Mitchell, that beaver is mine.
And if you don't believe me, just wait until you see him.
Everything. He invents things like your father, he's a lawyer and...
Gee, that'll be swell for me.
He said I was a genius and...
Gosh...
I didn't find out if he had any insurance.
Oh, well, I can ask him as soon as we find him.
We've been going for hours and we haven't found him yet.
But I don't care if we never find him.
And what's more, Buss Mitchell,
I think the whole idea is silly.
Pinkie Wingate, I'm fed up.
I wash my hands of the whole affair right here and now.
She can go back and marry Drubbs.
And if I ever here another word on this subject, I...
Pinkie, look!
It's him!
Oh, boy, it's him.
Where are you going?
Where are you going?
Nowhere.
Send him back, Pinkie, or he'll spoil everything.
I wanna go, too.
Billie, why don't you go hunt some beavers?
I'm tired of beavers.
There's a new kind of beaver in these woods.
They got stripes on them.
Striped beavers?
Sure.
They're gonna build a new dam, too.
It's right over there in those woods.
Oh, boy!
Hey, hey, wait a minute.
What's the matter?
Whatever you do, don't shoot now.
Why?
Skunks.
They are not. They're beavers.
Shhh.
Do beavers have stripes on their tails?
Striped ones do.
But there's no such thing as striped beaver.
There is, too. I saw one yesterday.
I'm gonna get my mother a striped beaver coat.
Look, wait a minute now...
You wouldn't want anybody to shoot your mother, would you?
What?
How would you like it if they wanted to make a fur coat out of her?
They couldn't.
I know they couldn't.
Suppose they could, you'd feel pretty bad, wouldn't you?
Now look, you see that skunk there?
That's the little skunk's mother.
The little skunk doesn't want his mother shot any more than you do.
I'm gonna shoot him anyway.
Hold it, wait a minute till I get out of the way.
I got him! I got him!
It was a skunk. It was a skunk.
It smells awful.
Well, it serves you right, you little...
You ruined my photograph and... now you fixed it so I can't get near my camera.
You get that camera.
It smells to high heaven but it can't hurt you any more
Go on, get it, or I'll...
Get that camera.
Both hands, you idiot.
I gotta hold my nose, don't I?
All right, hold your nose.
But stay back there till I tell you what to do. Now, listen, stay there!
Now listen to me. Carry that camera carefully and follow me.
But keep your distance.
Come on, now.
Watch it.
Don't come too close to me.
Easy with that camera, now.
That's right, my mother lives there.
All right, you stay there and I'll get your mother.
But I want my mother.
Hey, don't touch it, you've done enough damage already.
Madam, will you come out here and get this menace.
What?
Oh...
Is he yours?
Billie, what in the world?
Get back! He shot a skunk.
Oh, dear, stay back, Billie, stay back!
Now you stay back, my young lad...
Stop!
There's no need of terrifying him.
Me terrify him, after the mental torture he put me through?
I wasn't going to hurt him, but a good old-fashioned licking would do him a lot of good.
I think you're making a great deal of fuss about a little accident.
Accident?
Well, naturally Billie wouldn't want to hit a skunk.
Will you pardon me if I contradict you?
He insisted on hitting a skunk.
I stood out there after he'd ruined a photograph I spent hours setting up arguing with him, pleading with him, begging him to realize it was a skunk and not a beaver he was shooting at.
I even appealed to his love for his mother.
I'm glad I provided you with so much amusement.
Well!
Gee, I'm glad you're back.
The handle came off and we can't get the water to stop.
I think it's getting flooded in there.
Give me that handle.
Say, I meant to ask you.
Have you got any insurance?
I have not.
But if it's insurance against other people's kids believe me I'm gonna get some.
Now get out of here.
Come on, get out, quick!
I thought you said he was nice.
Go on, hurry up.
I thought you said he was nice.
Well...
I didn't know it would turn out like that.
What's the use of trying.
First you think you have someone, then, plop, you gotta drop it.
I should hope we would.
Buzz...
Skunk.
How can I get him to bury his clothes if I can't even get close to him?
Listen, Buzz.
There comes a time in every man's life when he's got to figure things out for himself.
Oh, Pinkie, that man over there was so funny.
Oh, Dottie, you look beautiful when you laugh.
Beautiful.
The grave's almost ready, Pinkie.
Loosen up on the rope.
Okay, Billie, get them off.
No!
But, Billie, you promised Dottie you'd bury it.
Not my Daniel Boone suit.
Now, listen, Billie, if you don't get those clothes off and bury them this minute
I'll come over and rip them off you.
If you touch him, you'll have to bury your own clothes.
Shhh.
Okay, Buzz.
Come on, Buzz, what's the matter?
Are you scared?
Oh, Billie, please, you can't do anything but bury it.
Yes, I can. I wanna kiss you, Pinkie.
I wanna hug and kiss you.
I love you so much I wanna kiss you.
Keep back!
Stay away, Billie!
Keep back!
Now listen, Billie...
Be reasonable.
You gotta bury it so the smell will go.
It'll still smell in the ground, won't it?
No. On account of the salt in the ground keeps the smell out of it.
There isn't any salt in the ground.
Sure there is.
Pepper, too?
Sure, all kinds of minerals.
Now, come on, Billie, old boy.
Take 'em off. Be a good scout.
I'm not gonna take them off and nobody can make me.
Listen, you want us to bury you in them?
You can't.
Oh, yes we can, if you won't take them off.
Buzz!
Now, look.
The salt will take the smell out of him at the same time, wouldn't it?
All we'd have to do would be to put a lot of old dirt over him and by morning...
I don't wanna be buried!
You can't bury me, you can't...
I got him!
You can't bury it!
You can't bury me either!
You can't bury it!
You can't bury me!
You cant' bury me and I won't bury myself.
We will if you don't bury them.
No!
You've got a choice. You bury them right away or we'll bury you.
Abercrombie, we'd better look into this.
We'll all starve. Even your only sister.
Well, well. You seemed to have struck a bit of an impasse.
Maybe I can help.
We can't make him take it off.
Dottie says we can't come home till he does
'cause it smells so terrible.
It is not. They don't smell bad to me anymore.
For Pete's sakes, do you wanna grow up and smell like that way all your life and have everybody hate you?
Pardon me, you haven't another one of those, have you?
I'm sorry, sir, I haven't.
I don't care, I'm not gonna bury my only Daniel Boone suit.
I bet you Daniel Boone would be surprised to hear you say that.
Why?
Why, he couldn't bury his clothes fast enough when he met a skunk.
Did he meet a skunk, too?
Many times. And he was always the first one in the crowd to take his clothes off.
What crowd?
Oh, hunters and trappers.
Do you know that once several hundred of them all met a skunk at the same time.
And before the rest of them could take their caps off
Boone's whole outfit was off and buried in the ground.
What did he wear home?
Well, he um...
A bathrobe. He always had one handy.
And then he'd jump into a briny salt bath until the last trace was gone.
Oh, he was a smart fellow, Boone.
But he had other suits.
Well, suppose you had another suit.
Suppose I had a suit you could wear?
Your suit wouldn't fit me.
But suppose I had a suit that would fit you.
A Daniel Boone suit?
Oh, a much better suit than that.
A Chief Bald Eagle outfit.
You know, Boone always used to borrow
Bald Eagle's outfit every chance he got so that he could skulk around among the unfriendly Indians in disguise.
Gosh, I'd like to do that.
Then let's see how long it'll take you to get out of those clothes.
Because, you know, Boone could get out of his suit in, oh, a half a minute.
If he could do that, I bet you could get out of yours in a minute at least.
Then we'll go up to the house and have something to eat...
Boy, I bet I can do it in a half a minute, too.
I bet I can do it in a quarter of a minute.
Untie me, untie me...
Oh.
May I come in?
Please do.
I don't know what to say, I...
I wanted to send you some flowers but there's no place around here you can get them.
What?
I mean, blowing up the way I did this afternoon.
Oh, you were perfectly justified.
I shouldn't have laughed.
You should have laughed, anyone should have laughed.
I don't know why I acted that way, really.
It doesn't mean anything and... afterwards I feel like a skunk.
Well, I really do feel like one, so that gives you a rough idea.
Please don't even think about it again.
I think I scared the daylights out of those kids and I probably should apologize to them too.
They're out burying the Daniel Boone suit.
There was quite an argument, but I won.
You have no idea how trying they can be sometimes.
You don't think so?
I guess you have at that.
I can't say that it wasn't a distinct shock when I learned that Daniel Boone belonged to you.
I don't mean that he isn't grand youngster, they're all swell kids, but...
I imagine your husband has a lot of fun with them.
Oh, he did.
Oh...
That oldest boy really has a remarkable mind.
Oh, Buzz is a friend of Pinkie's, but he might as well be mine, too.
He is bright.
Bright is hardly the word.
You know that kid put me through a cross-examination that hasn't been equaled since Darrow.
The little girl is your daughter, isn't she?
Yes, she's a darling.
You have no idea the help she has been to me.
It must be quite a problem bringing up three kiddies all alone.
It is.
Isn't it remarkable the difference there can be in odors?
Mmm. that smells wonderful.
I had to barter a bit for the Boone suit.
They're crazy about strawberry shortcake.
Who isn't? It's my favorite dessert.
You know, I had an aunt once that made strawberry shortcake that just melted in your mouth.
I couldn't wait to get over there for dinner.
You don't get good home cooking these days.
At least I don't.
Would you care to stay for dinner?
Oh, no, I couldn't possibly.
What do you think I'm hinting at?
Believe me, if I were in his position,
I'd certainly believe in plenty of insurance.
You're a lad off to Mr Slattery's heart.
He believes in it fervently.
In fact, he's the president of the
United Commercial Fund Insurance Company.
He is?
You mean the one on the calendar?
Gee. Say, is Mr Slattery mar....
Er... it... must be quite a comfort to Mrs Slattery to know that Mr Slattery believes so in insurance.
Perhaps it was.
But Mrs Slattery died several years ago.
She did, boy!
I mean, what a pity...
Not only that, but she's the best cook in Manson.
Why, her strawberry shortcake alone is the talk of the town.
And when she makes potato pancakes, oh...
You know, one time she had a fellow in for dinner and she had made one of those beautiful...
I'm all through, chief. I'm going hunting.
You cleaned your plate, huh?
Okay.
I got him, I got him!
Full of the old nick, eh?
I was just like him when I was a kid myself.
Gee, I'd give a lot for a youngster like him.
Well, I bet Billie would give a lot for a father like you.
Say, Chief, you know, I think I'll have to ask your mother to let me adopt you.
Mrs Wingate?
Yes?
About your children.
The children? What's happened?
Oh, they're quite safe.
Mr Slattery wishes me to inform you...
Mr Slattery?
Yes, the first house off the highway on the left.
He sent me to tell you that the older children have had their dinner and that master Billie has been de-skunked.
Hooray!
Poor man.
He requests as his payment the right to keep them for another hour.
With your permission, of course.
Why, certainly. And will you thank your Mr Slattery for me and tell him I'll come up and get them.
We'll come up and get them, after we've had our dinner.
Very good, sir.
Baking a cake, madam?
Strawberry shortcake.
We'll bring you a piece.
Thank you, sir. I'll await you with great anticipation.
With great anticipation.
Yes, indeed...
My great anticipation is for this dinner.
Come on.
But even Buzz never got away with an entire shortcake in one sitting.
Now, wait a minute. I left one piece.
I think I showed admirable restraint.
Wee, what a rain.
Yeah.
Something you intended having fixed, no doubt.
Oh, I thought I'd mended that.
You better move over here.
That doesn't do any good... here... take my hat.
No, on your head.
Oh.
Oh, boy, what a day.
From skunks to storms to the Wingates.
We have given you a time.
Nonsense, I love it.
This is the kind of a thing I go out to look for.
When business gets too serious,
I lock the office and lie out.
But doesn't your practice suffer?
Let it suffer. I don't.
I've got a theory that the only way to get any fun out of life is to live from day to day.
What are you laughing at?
Nothing, you just remind me of someone, that's all.
Don't you agree with me?
No, I never worry, I...
Hey, what's the matter here?
Sounds though this gas line were plugged.
You couldn't be out of gas?
No, I just filled it up this...
Wait a minute.  Was that yesterday?
Anyway, we don't have to worry,
I've got a special...
Reserve tank you put in yourself?
How did you know that?
You see, I just turn this button and presto, the tank refills.
Funny.
Must be something wrong with that pipe.
It couldn't be possible that the emergency tank is empty, too?
Of course not.
What do you suppose I have it for?
No, there's something wrong with it.
Would you mind getting up for a minute?
It's under the seat.
What do you know about that?
I bet you don't carry insurance either.
No, I don't. I don't believe in it.
What?
Say, does your family sell insurance?
Of course not, why?
Hey, here comes a car.
Hey, we're out of gas.
Wee! Did you get wet?
Wet and I got a mouthful.
Well, that's that.
You wait here and I'll run up the road and see if we can get some help.
I will not.
What else is there to do?
We'll go up and find the good Samaritan that's keeping my children.
In this storm?
Why not? I love it.
Well, I'll eat my hat.
Not till I get through with it.
I guess I won't. You know,
I didn't know there were women like you.
Come on, then, let's go.
Come on, now, skunk in the woods, you aren't afraid of a little thunder.
I want my mother.
I tell you what you do.
Come on, sit on my lap.
He's gonna cram the whole thing.
You got to, Pinkie.
Not here, Buzz.
Oh, go on.
All right.
A chief like you couldn't be afraid of a little thunder, that's foolish...
Mr Slattery...
I know how to take care of him.
All right.
Now, look, Billie, Dottie's gonna be here in a minute.
Sit here.
Did you ever wonder why in thunder, thunder comes in spring.
Once upon a time, it seems, all the world was wrapped in dreams. playful little fellas, so they tell us, said let's have our fling.
Spring is in the air, you know.
It's time to wake 'em up below
So... when the thunder starts to thunder don't run home and cry
They're playing ten-pins in the sky.
Little fellas way up yonder make the raindrops fly while rollin', bowlin' ten-pins in the sky.
The world will wear a new bonnet daffodils on it, thanks to the skies above.
Thunder and showers wake up the flowers
Where there are flowers there must be love
So, laugh at raindrops, laugh at thunder, clouds will soon roll by.
They're playing ten-pins in the sky!
Come on.
Wee, I must look a sight.
Well, a bit on the drowned-raft side.
Not an unattractice raft, though.
That's not exactly the loveliest compliment
I ever had, but...
Oh, Mrs Wingate, come in.
Do let me take those wet things.
The children are in there, in the den.
Won't you go right in?
Thank you.
Oh, say. I almost forgot.
Not quite as fresh as it was, but a promise is a promise.
Oh, the strawberry shortcake.
Dottie! Mommy.
Billie, hello baby.
Oh, don't you smell sweet.
Hello, darling.
Well, Mrs Wingate.
Mr Slattery?
I want to thank you so much.
It's a shame you had to have this infliction.
And I'm sorry to be so late.
Oh, not at all. I loved every moment of it.
In fact, I've just been pleading with the chief here to adopt me.
That is, provided you have no objection.
I think that would be lovely.
Well, good evening.
Come in, Mr Wingate.
Mr Thurlow, Mr Slattery.
I'm so sorry. Naturally I thought...
Naturally nobody but a husband would make a lady suffer as I have Mrs Wingate.
Do you know I succeeded in running out of gas in this storm?
Special reserve gas, darlings.
So don't be too hard on her, kitties.
You're both drenched.
I believe I can help you dry out.
Look at her, Buzz...
Who was to know he'd have to come?
Oh... when the thunder starts to thunder don't run home and cry.
They're playing ten-pins in the sky.
Shhh. You'll wake the chief.
Little fellas way up yonder make the raindrops fly while rollin', bowlin' ten-pins in the sky.
Come on, darling.
The world will wear a new bonnet
"daffydils" on it, daffydils...
Here we are.
Look what the water did.
Look at the stream. Look.
Atta boy. Watch your step.
How are we gonna get across?
Let's go swimming.
It's all bogged up, so you might have to help the ladies out of there.
Be careful, honey. Don't drop him.
Take it easy.
Hey, wait a minute.
Come on, Billie,
I think you better go to bed, it's awful late.
I can make it.
No, no, I got a better idea than that.
There we are.
You hang on tight.
There we are.
Well, aren't you going to put me down?
I am not, because the minute I do you're gonna vanish into that trailer.
Look, I'll tell you what I'll do with you. I'll make a bargain.
You give me five minutes more of the swellest day of my life and okay.
All right.
It has been a swell day.
You know, I didn't think it was possible.
What?
To find somebody else who thinks the open roads, skies and love of life is the only one to live.
Madam, it's wonderful, it's like walking on stars.
Are you always like this?
Always.
But don't you ever come down to earth?
Never. Why should I?
Well, after all, you must have certain responsibilities.
I haven't any responsibilities, and what's more,
I'm never gonna have any.
Look. My father was a very responsible man.
He worried himself into his grave.
So I made up my mind that I'd always have freedom.
Oh.
Well, it's wonderful if you can live that way.
I really must go.
Did you get Billie to bed, dear?
Yes, mother.
Well, good night.
Good night.
Good night, my princess.
Sweet dreams to you.
Thank you.
I think he's nice, don't you,
Dottie?
When thunder starts to thunder don't run home to cry...
They're playing ten-pins in the sky...
He has a lovely voice, hasn't he?
Little fellas, way up yonder... make the raindrops fly...
Gee, mother...
If we could just go on like we did tonight... it would be just like...
Well, like it used to be.
When you used to laugh all the time.
It would be just like one of the family... well, if it were someone we liked and...
He's putting out his light.
Look, Dottie.
It's time for us to put out ours, dear.
Get into bed.
What a big help you turned out to be last night.
We found the only man in the world that owns an insurance company and likes Billie both and then you go on and encourage that... that Thurlow.
Listen, I can't stand any more of this shilly-shallying.
You've gotta make up your mind right here and now which one she's gonna marry.
She cried last night, Buzz.
What? She couldn't.
Worse than at home and almost all night.
But she was having the time of her life.
There's no reason in the world for her to cry.
Aw, she couldn't.
Buzz, you don't always have to have a reason to cry.
I've cried lots of times just because
I felt funny inside.
Oh, talk sense, Pinkie.
Something happened to make you feel that way, didn't it?
Somebody was mean to you, or you didn't like somebody.
That's all you know.
Lots of times girls cry because they do like somebody.
Cry because they like somebody?
And if you ask me, it sounded like that kind of crying last night.
Oh, what nonsense.
How does that kind of crying sound?
Louder?
It's just different.
You know, I thought she did.
But then, when she cried, I didn't know.
But if that is why, she must love him even more than I thought.
What are you talking about?
Mr Thurlow.
Buzz, if she married him, she'd be happy just like she used to be and...
By God, Pinkie, if that's all the attention you pay to what I think.
I should think you'd have a little more regard for your own mother.
You heard him yourself last night.
He's the most improvident...
Daddy was too, maybe, but she loved him.
Yes, and she doesn't want any more of that kind of love either.
Buzz!
She told me that herself.
For Pete's sakes, Pinkie, you've gotta get it into your head that that kind of thing is all right when you're young and you haven't got any kids on your hands.
Oh...
When you have kids you've gotta be practical.
Now, Mr Slattery, now there is a...
Come in.
Madam, your humble servant.
A little token I ran up myself.
Thank you.
And I'm here to report that Mr Slattery's car is waiting.
Now, I suggest that you bundle off your offspring and we'll follow them in my rescued chariot.
Of course, I don't promise to get you home at all today but I do guarantee you just as much fun as yesterday.
Maybe it wasn't so much fun for you after all, eh?
I'm not going to Mr Slattery's with you.
Oh, come, come. I didn't disgrace you that much.
Maybe I shouldn't have said to him what I did about his insurance company...
We're going back home.
Huh?
No, no.
I don't understand. But why?
I'm just going home, that's all.
You didn't expect me to stay here forever, did you?
No, but wait, last night...
Look, if you think I'm going to let you get away now, you're crazy.
Anyway, you can't pack up like this and go running off without some reason.
But I have a reason.
I'm going to be married.
You?
Oh, no, you mean you're going to go back and settle down and play bridge with banker's wife somewhere?
I'm going to be the banker's wife.
What?
What's so dreadful about that?
It's just what I want.
Oh, I guess it's none of my business, but...
I don't know, you seem the only woman
I ever met that well... free is the only word for it.
Guess I must be crazy.
But I'm not. Look, you can't make me believe that you want to be anything else but free,
I know because you love the same things I do.
All right, supposing I do.
Supposing I do love your up in the clouds, crazy, irresponsible sort of life.
But I hate it, too. I hate it because my children are paying for it.
It's all right for you to talk about being free. You haven't children.
I have and I tell you it's different.
As long as they're dependent on me, all I want is security.
I know, but, my dear, look, if you...
Don't talk, there's nothing to be said.
Just, please go and leave me alone.
Very well.
Dottie.
Oh...
Tell Buzz to pack, Pinkie. We're going home.
And tell Mr Slattery's driver we're sorry.
But, Dottie.
Do you hear me?
Would you please tell Mr Slattery we're very sorry but we've got to go home.
Yes, Miss.
Aw, gee, I don't wanna go home.
Well, you've got to.
Go tell Buzz and help him pack.
All right.
Hey! Hey, wait!
Wait just a minute!
Well, well, Pinkie.
I thought you weren't coming.
We aren't. We're leaving right away.
That's why I had to come.
You see...
I'm glad you did.
Was there anything you wanted?
Well...
Mr Slattery, did you mean what you said last night?
Because if you did... well, you'd need to have somebody to take care of him anyway and I know him better than anybody.
I wouldn't be any bother and... if you could just take me, too
I'd do anything, honestly I would.
Look...
Let's sit down.
I don't think I understand exactly what you're trying to say.
Well...
I mean about Billie.
Hmm.
You remember last night you said you'd give anything if you had him yourself?
Yeah.
Well, I thought if you were going to adopt him, you could...
I mean, if you meant it, you could...
I guess it's all kind of crazy.
I shouldn't have come.
No, no, no, no.
You tell me all about it.
No, I have to go because they'll be waiting for me.
Wait a moment.
Why, darling, you're trembling.
Oh, come on, tell me what's wrong.
I don't know everything, I guess.
You see, I thought if I could explain to Dottie that we'd all be happier if she would be.
And she would.
A person oughta marry somebody they're gonna be happy with, shouldn't they?
Not just somebody because they have children.
She'd never be happy if she went back and married Mr Drubbs.
Look how happy she was last night.
Yeah.
I bet she'd always be happy with
Mr Thurlow.
Even if he doesn't carry insurance, because she doesn't care about those things for herself.
It's only on account of us.
And if we were out of the way.
Somebody's gotta do something before it's too late.
And if we can't...
I just wish I'd never been born.
Oh, shh... now, Pinkie.
Everything's gonna be all right.
Here, darling.
Thank you.
Look, Pinkie...
I've always wanted children.
And I did mean what I said about Billie.
More than that.
I'd give a whole lot to have a daughter like you, but...
Mothers are pretty good, Pinkie.
Your mother loves you both so much more than she could love anyone else.
She'd never be happy without you and Billie.
Why, you're her whole world.
And don't think for one moment it isn't more important to her to keep you all together than... well, than anything.
So, if I were you, darling...
I'd trust her.
She knows what's best.
And no matter where she goes,
I'd go with her.
And help her and try to show her how happy I was.
Hey!
Wait a minute.
Did the Wingates go?
Yeah, they've gone all right.
That's too bad.
Just after that poor little kid came all the way up to see me this morning, too.
Well, it's none of my business, but I can't get her out of my mind.
I came down here to tell her mother some things.
If she isn't mighty careful she'll ruin that child's life thinking she's doing the right thing.
You know... you really can't fool kids.
Say, what are you talking about?
Well, Mrs Wingate is going to marry someone she doesn't love.
Ditching someone she does because the fellow is... well, he's improvident.
And Pinkie... now imagine this...
Pinkie thinks that if I adopt her and Billie it will give her mother one more chance for happiness.
Does the fellow sound like a heel to you or what?
Why, any man who wouldn't, or couldn't, or didn't take care of a woman's kids should be left behind.
Hey, look, wait a minute.
Are you telling me that Mrs Wingate is running away from some fellow she loves?
Did Pinkie tell you that? Did she?
Yes, yes.
Well, I'll be...
Hey, get out of the way, there.
Hurry up!
Well, we got him started, ol' Chief Vinegar Puss.
Oh, now we've got to stop the Wingates.
Let's get to a phone.
Gee.
Gosh!
It's not us.
But, officer, we weren't speeding.
Gosh, Dottie, we weren't even going 30mph.
What's the trouble, officer?
Is this the Wingate trailer?
Yes, I'm Mrs Wingate.
Just a minute. We have a much more serious charge than speeding here.
Gosh.
But, officer, Uncle Joe said that when there's a relation it isn't kidnapping.
That's what your Uncle Joe says.
But, officer, this is ridiculous.
But you just heard him confess, mam.
You can't mean it.
The children only wanted to...
Are these two in on it, too?
No, they kidnapped me, too.
Well, I guess you'll have to tell that to the judge.
You can't mean it.
We didn't want to do anything except get her away from Mr Drubbs.
Listen, we'll get a lawyer, we'll take this...
Hey, wait, we've got a lawyer.
Gee, I'm glad to see you.
You're just in time.
They want to arrest me for kidnapping Dottie.
What?
Say, what's the trouble here, officer?
And who are you?
He's Mr Thurlow, he's my lawyer.
If you're his lawyer, maybe you want to see this.
Well, I'll be...
For the love of...
Gosh.
Think you'd better take them all back and lock them up.
No, I don't think that'll be necessary, officer.
I'll be responsible for them.
That's all, boys.
From now on I'm looking after the Wingate family. Come on, Buzz.
In you go, here. Atta boy, Billie.
Just a moment.
I'll tell you all about it. Listen.
You follow us.
You get in there and get your apron off and get a sweater.
I got you and you got me
Who cares how rough the road may be
We'll go bumpty-bumpty-bumpty-bump on the bumpy road to love.

Baby Take a Bow (1934)
- Oh, good morning, Flannigan.
- Hello, Harry.
One round-trip and one-way as usual?
- That's right.
Yeah. He'll be coming back alone.
Here you are.
Hiya, Flannigan.
- Hello, Welch.
Save a seat for me, will ya?
I'll be right with you. Hiya, Harry.
- Hello, Welch.
Give me one to Ossining.
- Going to make sure they take him to the right place?
No. He's not one of my boys. I'm going up to the big house on some private business.
- For the landlord.
- You never take them up anyway, do you?
Who me? No. The city cops do that after I catch them.
- Just a minute.
- You sure put Sing on its feet all right.
Oh, I help the population some, I guess.
Well, I'll be seeing you.
Oh, Welch.
You forgot your ticket.
Don't worry.
I would've found it out.
Come on.
- Two tickets for Niagara Falls, please.
- Oh, congratulation, madam.
- What train?
- The 9:20, and I want to stop off Ossining.
Ossining?
You mean Sing Sing?
No, I mean Ossining.
Hello, Fred.
Hello, John.
- Hi.
- Well, you got quite a haul of fish today, huh?
Wonder what that chiseler's going up to Sing Sing for.
Shake down some prisoner, I guess.
He'd do anything go a little dough.
- Why, I thought the insurance company fired him.
- Sure. They all did.
Well, Trigger Stone.
- How long is hi in for?
- Five years.
Five years is right.
- But I'll make lost time when I get out.
- Says you.
Thanks for saving the seat, Flannigan.
Well, anyhow,
I got my name in the paper.
Too bad you couldn't think of a better way to do it, Scott.
Well, hello, Kay. Here you are.
Here a seat for you.
The further I sit from you,
Mr. Welch, the better I like it.
- Board!
- Take those bags into the next car, please.
Sorry, miss, the train's full up today.
Here you are, Kay.
Sit right down here.
Two tickets to Niagara Falls, eh?
How romantic.
That's where honeymooners go, hmm?
Oh, yes. Eddie Ellison gets out today.
Say, you're not really going to marry that guy, are you?
Any objection?
Say, listen, kid. I want to give you a little friendly advice.
Friendly advice!
Well, that's good, coming from the fela who caused Eddie's conviction.
Now take easy, Kay. I'm telling you that I'm your friend.
- More than a friend.
- Yes, you've tried to be more than a friend...
- ever since you had Eddie arrested.
- Now don't be that way.
You are a nice girl, and you're about to make the mistake of your life.
- That's my business.
- Sure it is, and don't let him tell you any different.
Catching crooks is my business, but marring them isn't yours.
That side of Eddie's life is one forever.
- He's going straight.
- How many times have I heard that before?
- Once a crook, always a crook. Nobody trusts them.
- She'll trust him.
That'd be enough for my dough.
- Thanks, Mr. ...
- Scotgt's name.
I'm pleased to meet ya.
Eddie, when you were admitted here,
I gave you a choice two roads to take.
You took the right one, and it cut four months off your stretch for you.
- Now will you let me advise you again?
- Certainly, sir.
Something kept up your morale while you were up here.
- You're a good guesser.
- Well, whatever it was, stick to it outside.
Have you got a job waiting for you?
- The biggest and best job a man ever hat.
- Good wages?
- Not a cent.
- Well, but how...
- I've had a girl waiting me for 18 months.
- Congratulations, my boy.
- The very best of luck.
- Thank you, sir.
I'm sorry I can't do much for a wedding present... but, uh, you take this card to Hopkins Agency.
They place quite a number of my boys.
That is, the ones I believe in.
- Well, gee...
- and, uh, by the way, here's the $ 10 the law allows.
- Thank you, sir. Good-bye.
- Good-bye. Good luck.
Eddie. Eddie.
- Why, you big, good-looking...
- Hey, now cut that out, funny face.
I can't help it.
I'm so glad to see you.
Well, I guess it's back to the city, huh?
No, we're not going back to the city, Eddie.
I've a big surprise.
Say, what is it this, a practical joke?
It's no joke, but boy it's practical.
- We're going to Niagara Falls.
- You mean right now?
- From here?
- The train leaves in half an hour.
Aw, gee, you're swell, and I'm the luckiest man in the world.
Luck had nothing to do with it.
You couldn't get away from me if you tried.
That's right. I tried to hide in prison and it was hopeless.
Well, glad to see you around, Eddie.
Oh, thank, Flannigan.
Meet the future wife.
Oh, yeah.
We made the trip op together.
And boy, you sure got a girl who knows her own mind.
Well, if it isn't my old pal, Welch.
As big as life and twice as natural.
- He's no pal of yours. He's still got it in for ya.
- What do you mean?
He's been throwing the hooks into you all the way up. Trying to promote himself.
Yeah, I was just trying to give her a little friendly advice, that's all.
- I happen to know a lot more about crooks than she does.
- Why, you...
- Eddie!
- If you sack him, you'll get into trouble.
You're on the way out. Keep going.
I'm on the way in. So I got nothing to lose.
Thanks, fella. I'll be seeing you when you get out.
Good luck. I wish I could be your best man.
Oh! How does a guy like me rate all this?
Darling. You rate the best in the world.
Yeah. I got it.
Right here in my arms.
Now look what you've done.
Say, I haven't begun to do things yet.
So far, you've made all the plans.
Got us a little flat, and you've lined me up a nice job.
But don't forget, beginning next Monday you quit and I get going.
Oh, I wish this could last for a year.
It's been so wonderful.
It's going to be wonderful all our life.
Won't it be nice when we save some money...
- we get our little home up in Yonkers?
- Oh, Eddie.
- Say, you didn't know I was an artist, did you?
- No.
Look... just get a load of our little dream house.
It's going to be painted white all over with green sheers and a red roof.
We're going to have o bright yellow picket fence with black tops.
- That sounds beautiful.
- The whole place is going to be splotched with honeysuckle.
We would raise our own honey if we bought a pair of bees.
- You're silly.
Now, right here is the chicken coop where we grow our own breakfast.
Where's the doghouse to put in when you're bad?
Oh. Right here.
"X" marks the spot.
Who's that? You?
- No, that is a "g-nom-e."
- Hmm?
Uh, elf.
Well, it's made out of tera... tera...
- Aw, plaster.
- It's marvelous, darling.
Let me show you what I picked out.
See, it has a real fireplace and a master bedroom with twin beds.
- What's that?
- That's a nursery.
That's where you can put your little "g-nom-e."
- You mean our little "g-nom-e."
- Maybe our little elf too.
Six Years Later
I'll be in a minute, dear.
That'll be all for today, Eddie.
- Yes, sir.
- By the way, I'm going to give you that job I promised you.
As soon as your friend can handle the car, you start at the factory.
Gee, Mr. Carson, I don't know how to thank you.
But anyway, I want to thank you for Larry too.
- We'll make good for you, sir. Both of us.
- I'm sure you will.
- What is your friend's name?
- Larry Scott.
Oh, yes.
Thank you.
- Hiya, fela.
- Well, what's the verdict?
Guilty. You start work tomorrow.
- Great.
Aw, gee thanks, Eddie. What a break after unloading freight and washing dishes.
Did you say anything about me?
I mean, about Sing Sing?
I didn't tell him about myself, so why should tell him about you?
Do you thing it make any difference if he knew?
- I don't think so, but why take a chance?
- Yeah, I guess you're right.
Well, I got to run. I'm calling for Jane at the dancing school.
Now that you.ve got a job, I suppose she'll lead you right up to altar.
- Not if I can lead her first.
- Okay, kid, do your stuff.
- If you see Kay, tell her
I'm bringing home liver and onions.
- Okay. So long.
SCHOOL of DANCING
CHILDREN'S CLASSES
Hello, Mommy.
- Hello, precious.
- Mommy.
- Oh, don't let me interrupt, Jane.
- That's all right, Kay.
The class is over.
You may go now, children.
- May I show Mommy the new step you taught me?
- Not now, darling.
- Better wait till we get home, hmm?
- It'll only take a minute.
Look!
- That was marvelous, darling.
- Wait till I get home and show it to Daddy.
He'll never be able to do it as well as you.
- Hello, girls.
- Hello, Larry.
- Hi, Kay.
- Hi.
Meet Mr. Carson's new chauffeur.
- That's wonderful.
- Oh, Larry, I'm so glad.
That calls for a specials celebration.
- How about you two having supper with us?
- That'd be fine, huh?
- I know, liver and onions. Sold.
- That's great. I'll get my things.
And Shirley. Now look at what I've got for you.
Ooh. Thank you,
Uncle Larry.
Now what are you going to give me?
- A kiss.
Come on, sweet.
Get your hat and coat on.
Does she know about her birthday party tomorrow night?
Try and keep anything from that little monkey with Eddie around.
DETECTIVE
HEADQUARTERS
Trigger Stone was released from Sing Sing yesterday.
The warden reports he was had to handle up there.
Bragget about what he'd do when he out.
Better keep an eye on him, boys.
- Hiyam, Sarge.
- Anything we can do gor you, Welch?
No, but there's something
I can do for the department.
- Wait. The captain's busy.
- He won't be too busy to see me when he knows what I got.
Hiya, Cap.
- Hello.
- Well, I'm going to give you a break.
- Yeah?
- You ever hear of the Stuart Carsons?
- Yes. They live on Park Avenue.
- You remember Eddie Allison?
- He's their chauffeur.
- You Know a Larry Scott?
He's out on parole.
Well, here's something about them that you don't know.
You mean about Ellison getting
Scott a job with the Carsons?
There you are. Plain as the nose on your face.
They got something op their sleeves.
- Listen, Welch, those boys are as clean as a whistle.
- Sure they are.
Eddie Ellison's been out six years.
He's strictly on the level.
Got a swell wife and a cute little kid.
Let me tell you something.
You've hounded those boys enough.
You've had them fired from jobs, stopped them from getting new ones.
- You leave them alone.
- All right. I was only trying to give you the right steer.
- Thanks, Welch. We appreciate it.
- No trouble at all.
Anytime I can do anything for you, don't hesitate to call.
Still trying to promote himself a job.
Just the same. We better keep an aye on Scott and Ellison. Never can tell.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
- Ready or not, I'm coming.
- Don't you peek, Daddy.
Well, she certainly can hide better than anybody else in the world.
Well, I wonder where she can be.
Ah, now I've got you.
- I don't know where she is.
- Here I am.
Oh, so you think you can wrestle, huh?
Where are you? Where are you?
Now I've got you.
You Know, I think I'm going to spank you.
Now I'm going to eat you all up.
Oh, what a meal, lamb's leg and pig's feet and duck's neck.
You're my little lamb, little apple dumpling, my sugar-pie and I love you.
You big baby.
Keeping her awake.
There, didn't I tell you now?
Mommy's always right.
- There, you see? You get kissed, and I get scolded.
- Oh.
Kiss Daddy good night.
- Good night, my little "g-nom-e."
- I'm not "g-nom-e." am I, Mommy?
No, darling.
You're Mommy's little elfie.
Then if I'm an elfie, what are you?
- Well, I'm... I'm a...
- Good night, darling.
- Good night, Mommy.
Daddy.
Come here.
Tell me what you bought me for a birthday present.
- Oh, no. That's a secret.
- Will you tell me if I guess?
- Mmm, well, maybe.
- A pair of roller skates?
- No.
- A dollhouse.
- No
Aw, Daddy. If you tell me, I tell you what I'm going to get you for your birthday.
- Oh, no. I want to be surprised.
_ Will you tell me for a kiss?
- Well, that's awful tempting, but...
I bet I now. A ballet dress.
- A ballet dress. Now, what made you think of that?
- Because that's what I want most.
Come on now, you little "g-nom-e."
You've got to go to sleep.
# I'm going to get a Ballet dress.
# I'm going to get a ballet dress.
- # Don't tell Mommy I told you.
# - I won't.
Now, come on.
You snap those eyes shut.
- I will if you sing to me.
- All Right.
- # Rock-a-bye baby
# On the treetop
# When the wind blows the cradle will rock
# When the bough bends the candle will fail
# Down will come baby cradle and all
- Yippee!
- Oh, now, come on, darling. You go to sleep.
You're going to get me in trouble with your mother. Good night now.
- Have you been in there all this time?
- Uh-huh.
Did you tell her about her present?
Who, me?
- Gee, won't she look cute in that.
- It's just darling.
- It cost an awful lot.
- Ell, It's for Shirley, isn't it?
She only has a birthday once a year.
- Every day is her birthday with you.
- And why shouldn't it be?
- We better hide it from her.
- Say, here's another little gadget
I bought for Shirley.
- What is it?
- Take look.
- I don't see a thing.
- No, but we do.
Oh, Eddie, you and tricks.
You're not going to give it to the baby.
You're making her as bad you are.
- Say, how about going to the movies with us tonight?
- Oh, thanks.
- But we can't leave Shirley.
- They're showing 10.000 years in Sing Sing at the Cameo.
- Gee, what a long stretch.
- They say it's awful funny.
Not for my dough.
- Well, come on, Jane. We'll be late.
- Larry, what's your hurry?
If you miss three or four years, it don't make any difference.
- Have a good time.
- Thanks. Well, I'm sorry you won't come with us.
- So long.
- Good-bye.
- Hey, Larry?
- Yeah?
We got to be on the job early. Stop by and we'll dunk a couple of doughnuts.
- Right.
- And say, let me know what the guy to get 10.000 years.
- So long.
- So long.
Good morning everybody.
The first exercise this morning is a simple one.

Ready? One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.

That's fine.
Now here's the next exercise.

Are you ready?
All right. go.
One, two, three, four.

Now bend down, touch the knee with the face.
Repeat four times.
Are you ready?
All right.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.

Now leap forward, grasshopper fashion.
Six counts and reverse.
Ready? Go.
One, two, three, four, five, six.
Back, five, four, three, two, one. That's it.
Now sit erect. Let's start the day with a good, hearty laugh.
My goodness.
I'll bet Daddy isn't up yet.
You go outside and play, darling.
Come on, sleeping sickness.
Get up.
- What time is it?
- What time do you want?
It's time you were up out of that bet.
I wasn't sleeping.
I was thinking.
- Hurry up. Your breakfast will be spoiled.
_ Oh! What are you doing?
Top of the morning to you.
And the head of the evening to you.
- Hey, what are you so pleased about?
- Nothing in particular.
Oh, don't try to kid me. It's written all over your face. Go look at the mirror.
Congratulation, Lary.
She's a great girl.
You bet she is. And say, we'll never be able to thank Eddie enough...
- for getting that job for me.
- He was only too glad to do it.
Come on now. Sit down and have your coffee.
- Aren't you waiting for Eddie?
- I should waiting and eat a cold breakfast?
Not for any husband. Sometimes I get so irritated, I could give him poison.
Yeah, and I get so mad, I could take it.
What do you know about that?
To hear you two in the morning you'd think you were ready to jump at each other's throats.
In the morning?
What about the rest of the day?
Well, I just hope Jane and me get along as well as two.
Yes, Larry and Jane got engaged last night.
Well, I don't why a fine girl like Jane wants to marry a mag like you.
- Well, thanks.
- The bride isn't here, so I may as well kiss this dummy.
Eddie, got a cigarette?
Sure. Here.
Help yourself.
And I bit for that.
Eddie, will you ever grow up?
Those are just for moshes.
Here, have one these.
Say, didn't you tell me last night about some work you had to do on the car this morning?
- Come on. We'll be late.
- A fella never gets a chance to get any breakfast around here.
Well, you oughtn't to have so much sleep in the morning.
- Come on
- Good bye.
Good bye.
- Hello, Shirley.
- Hello, Mr. O'Hara.
- So, you're Eddie Ellison's kid?
- I'm not a kid. I'm a girl.
- And today is my birthday.
- Well.
If I'd have knowed it,
I'd have bought you a present.
My birthday isn't over yet.
Oh, isn't?
It won't be over until after the party.
Do you want to come?
We're having ice cream.
Well, I don't like ice cream, but maybe I'll come anyway.
And maybe you can bring the present with you.
- There's my daddy.
- Trigger Stone.
Shirley, come here. Come on Run up.
Your mother wants you.
- Why?
- Never mind. Go ahead. Skip.
Don't forget my present, mister.
- Bye, Daddy.
- Bye.
Surprised to see me, huh? Listen, you guys, you got to help me. That's why I'm here.
- We can't talk here.
- No. Come on.
I pulled a job last night...
- Not so loud.
I want you guys to help me get rid of the stuff.
It'll be a cinch a cinch for you.
All you got to do is peddle the stuff, and we'll split 50/50.
- You got us wrong, Trigger.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- That goes for both of us.
- I am not asking you to do nothing crooked.
- Any fence will grab what I got.
- Sure and any cop, too, and us with it.
Nothing doing. Besides, it isn't doing us any good being seen with you.
Now lay off us, and don't hang around here either.
Come on, Larry.
We're late.
Daddy, don't be late for my party.
I won't.
Things are getting pretty hot around Park Avenue.
- There was a job pulled at 1170 last night.
- That's in my district.
I want you to handle the job. The Stuart Carson pearls were stolen shortly shortly after midnight.
Just the kind of a job that Trigger Stone would pull. I want you to round him up.
NATIONAL
INSURANCE COMPANY
I'm sorry, Welch, but we prefer not to employ men who use your tactics.
Yeah? I get results, don't I?
Say, listen, last night the Stuart Carson peals were stolen, weren't they?
You've got a  $50.000 insurance policy them.
All right. Give me Daniels, give me a little authority, I'll recover those in three days.
- Have you got a lead?
- Have I? Wait till you hear it.
Huh. Say, that reward of $5,000 is practically in my pocket right now.
Are you sure Ellison brought the Carson's car in late yesterday and met his pal here?
- That's right.
- They didn't come back last night?
- No.
You sure of that? That's all I wanted to now.
- Gee, you look like a general.
- Never mind the looks.
Do you think I'll be able to drive the car to suit Mr. Carson?
You drive better than I do now.
Guess you can take the wheel tomorrow.
- Hi, Eddie.
- well, if it isn't the old snooper himself.
All dressed up in his two rubber heels.
That makes three of you... heels.
- Funny fella, huh?
- Say, are you here on business or pleasure?
Pleasure. I can't tell you how glad
I am to see you boys again.
That's too bad we haven't the day off.
Then we could take you a ride.
That'd be a pleasure.
Well, so long.
We've got a very busy day ahead of us.
Oh. If Welch's brains were in his feet, he might be able to think.
I wish I'd poked him in the nose, just for old time's sake.
- Listen, you did that once. Next time it's my turn.
- Wouldn't he love to put the hooks in us again.
- You said it.
- I wonder if he's got a job.
-Maybe somebody hired him just for laughs.
- How does that half-wit get away with his racket?
- I don't know... but I hope that's the last we ever see of that ugly pan of his.
Yeah. Ugly is right.
Well, boys, thanks for the ride.
- I wonder what he wants with the boss?
- I don't Know.
- Maybe we made him sore.
- Gee, I got it.
Maybe he's going to tell Carson we were in Sing Sing.
- I'm Special Investigator Welch.
The Carsons expecting me.
- Very well, sir.
Hiya, Daniels.
- Anything new?
- Hannigan's in there. He's covered all the servants.
- Huh. Barking up the wrong tree as usual, eh?
- How about the chauffeurs?
They just dropped me off here.
Have the butler bring them on.
- You know what to do?
- Right.
Right.
How are you,
Mr. and Mrs. Carson?
I'm the special investigator from the insurance company.
And Mrs. Carson, don't you worry.
You'll soon be wearing your pearls again.
- Have you found them?
- No. But I'm pretty sure your chauffeurs are mixed up in it.
I can't believe it.
They're such nice-looking boys.
Yeah, well you can't go much on looks.
They both got prison records.
Why didn't you tell us that, Mr. Flannigan?
Because if they're innocent, why prejudice you against them?
- Here they are now.
- Well, I don't want to be here when you're questioning them.
Come in, boys.
Morning Mr. Carson.
I don't suppose you boys know... there was a pearl necklace stolen from this house last night?
Well, what do you now about that?
- What do you know about it?
- This is the first I've heard about it.
You're not trying to pin it on us are you, Welch?
- No. I'm just going to ask you a few questions, that's all.
- sure. Go ahead.
Where did you go after you left the garage last night?
I went right home, and after dinner, my wife and I went to bed.
- Anybody with you?
- No.
- Where did you go?
- I went to the movies with my girl.
- What was the name of the picture?
- 10,000 Years in Sing Sing.
You ought see it. The crook was a real guy.
- Yeah, a regular fella.
I'll check your alibis later.
Want to ask them anything else,
Mr. Flannigan?
No. I think you've more than covered the ground, Mr. Welch.
- Good day, Mr. Carson.
We'll keep in touch with you.
- Thank you, Mr. Flannigan.
Don't worry, Mr. Carson.
We won't overlook anything.
I'm sure you won't, Mr. Welch. Why didn't you boys tell me that you'd been in prison?
Well, I'll tell you why,
Mr. Carson.
Because every time we told an employer about our jail record, we didn't get the job.
So after a few tough breaks, we decided not to say anything about it.
But we've been going straight, and that's on the level.
I'm sorry you didn't trust my judgment.
But under the circumstances,
I can't very well keep you.
Well, I'm sorry you feel that way about it, Mr. Carson but...
I... I guess we understand.
- Good-bye, sir.
- Mr. Simpson will send you your checks.
Yes, sir.
Most unfortunate this had happen.
Mr. Carson, from now on, every move these boys make will be watched by one of my men.
Just leave to me.
So long.
- So long, Jenkins.
- Good-bye, Eddie.
Come on. Quit worrying, will you?
This isn't the only job in town.
I wasn't thinking of the job.
I was thinking of Welch.
That bird has got something up his sleeve.
Aw, sometimes I wonder if going straight really pays.
- Hey, cut out that'll Jane think?
- But what'll Jane think?
She's a hundred percent for you.
She wouldn't think anything against you any more than Kay would doubt me.
We're not going to tell them anything tonight though.
- Why not?
- I'm not going to let anything spoil Shirley's birthday party.
# Happy birthday to you
# Happy birthday to you
# Happy birthday, dear Shirley
# Happy birthday to you
Come on, Eddie. Speech.
Come on. Make a speech.
Speech?
Uh, ladies and gentlemen... heirs and heiress... this is indeed an unexpected honor.
And when an unexpected honor is thrust upon one... it is, uh... it is... an unexpected honor.
- Er, uh...
- You better read it, Daddy.
Yeah.
I better read it.
-  And now a speech from Shirley.
- Oh, yes. From Shirley.
Up you go.
I want to thank everybody for the presents you gave me. Very, very much.
And I hope someday when it's your birthday that I can give them all back to you.
And now that you folks have heard two of the world's most famous after-dinner speakers... we're going to proceed with the entertainment.
Larry, strike up the band.
You all follow me.
- Party's still going on, eh?
- Yeah, they seem to be having a good time.
Well, let them celebrate tonight.
It'll be my party tomorrow night. You just...
- Leave it to you. I know.
- Yeah.
- Good evening, Mr. Flannigan.
- Good evening, Mr. Welch.
- Nice fella, Flannigan.
- You said it.
Ladies and gentlemen, your attention this way.
At great expense, we have succeeded in importing, for the first time on any roof... and go your entertainment... that famous star,
Mademoiselle Shirley Ellison.

But they did.

Will you excuse us for a minute?
I want to talk to Eddie alone.
Now listen Eddie. When we were married, we said we'd go 50/50 on everything, didn't we?
Well, that meant joy and trouble too.
You always let me in on the joy, now why not the trouble?
- There's nothing more to tell.
- Eddie, look at me.
- Did Larry have anything to do with this?
- No.
Well, then we haven't a thing to worry about.
Oh, no.
Not a thing... except Welch.
He'd like nothing better than to send us both up again.
I'm not worried exactly, but it's getting my goat.
Oh, Eddie, be yourself.

It's you and Shirley.

Why, you're a sweetheart, a wife and mother all rolled into one.

Hey, what's the matter?
Why, you're crying.
No, I'm not.
I... There.
That's right. Now it isn't gonna rain no more.
I wonder why Welch is giving us the absent treatment.
The suspense is driving me nuts.
I wish he'd get it over with.
Oh, now forget about Welch, will you?
We're going on about our business just as if nothing had happened... which means I've got to buy Shirley a new pair of shoes.

Besides,
I never drink on the job.
Don't do that! I mean, you'll... you'll stir up the grounds.
That don't taste good.

- Tel me when you're ready, Daddy.
Daddy has no time to play now, dear.
- Well, hurry up.
- Good-bye.
- Say, what is this?
- Why, just a gag.
Shirley and I are always playing games.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- Where does that door lead to?
- Oh, that's where I sleep.
It's one of the finest little rooms you ever saw in your life.
I'd just love to show it to you. Now look.
- So this is your bedroom?
- Yeah.
Yeah? What's that button for?
A secret panel?
- No. That's the bed.
- Don't kid me.
I'll have you up for manslaughter.
- He's getting warm. He's hot.
- He's cold.
- He's hot.
- He's cold.
It'll be hot for you birds when I hang this onto you.
- Where does that door lead to?
- To the bathroom. Want to take a bath?
Daddy, you didn't fool me.
I got the prize.
Get her out of here.
Yeah-Yeah. You're right. Here's the prize.
Go and buy yourself some ice cream.
- Goody-goody-goody.
- Yeah. Goody-goody.
Yeah.
Where we going to hide them now?
Just the think.
That's the first time I knew what a carpet-sweeper was for.
- Open it.
- Open.
Where?
- Here, here.
- All right. I got it. Hurry up.
Okay. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute. Give it to me.
Here, hold these.
I'll get open.
I got it.
Drop them in there, quick.
Now if we can only hide this carpet-sweeper, I know we'd be safe.
Yeah, if we could hide the apartment,
Welch might quit his job.
Oh, yeah? They're not in there.
You can't fool me.
- No. You can't fool him.
- No. You can't fool him.
Morning, Mr. Ellison. Can I borrow your carpet-sweeper?
Can you..
I'll say you can, Anna.
- Thanks. I'll bring it right back.
- That's right.
You keep it just as long as you want.
Well, this is round one, but don't either one of you birds think I'm though with you yet.
Come up sometime, we'll play
"Button, button, who's got the button."
- Whew!
- Whoo.
Boy, that was a close...
Good morning, Annie.
Anything new?
Same old thing, Mr. O'Hara.
Nothing ever happens around place.
Give me a ride, will you, Annie?
Sure. Get on.
Come on, mister.
You want to ride with me?
I might break it. Besides,
I don't want to play anymore.
You're not much good at playing games, are you?
All right, Shirley, get off.
Come on, Kitty.
- So you work here, huh?
- Mm-hmm.
I'll bet you're a winner when you're all dressed up.
Oh, go on with you.
Say, what would you do if you happened to come across a real pearl necklace?
You'd be surprised.
Wait a minute, Mrs. Ellison
I want to talk to you.
I'm not interested, Mr. Welch.
- Maybe you will be when you know you can help Eddie.
That's it.
I thought you'd be sensible.
Never mind that.
What about Eddie?
Well, that's more like it. I didn't think you'd like to see Eddie marking a long trip.
What do you mean?
Now listen. Carson won't prosecute if he gets those pearls back.
Now I figure that Eddie's protecting Larry.
I want you to go to Larry and get those pearls.
Tell him that you'll return them with no questions asked.
And after you get them, all you got to do is to give them to me.
Yeah, and you'll collect the reward and send both back to prison.
No, thanks.
Now get this, Mr. Welch.
Eddie and Larry are both running straight.
I know it, you hear?
I know it.
And yet what does it get them?
You hound them every step they take.
You put them out of one job and keep them from getting another.
Those boys haven't done anything wrong, and you've got to let them alone!
Now you get out of here!
Get out!
- Are you still here?
- Uh-huh.
- Want some of my ice cream?
- No, thanks.
Oh, go ahead.
I ate the other one... and if I finish this,
I'll get a tummy ache.
No, thanks. I've already got a tummy ache.
Oh, how awful!
- How did Shirley ever get hold of them?
- That's what I'd like to know.
- Where are they now?
- In the carpet sweeper.
- What? Well, let's get the carpet sweeper.
- Annie's got it.
- Hey, Eddie! I got it back!
- Hire it is.
- Give me it.
We've got to get them back to Mr. Carson.
I know he'll believe our story.
Oh, we'll get them back.
Just a minute now.
- Open it this way you did before.
- "Open it the way I did..."
- What do you want to do? Kill me?
- Leave me alone!
- It's on the other side!
- Wait a minute.
- This thing is her Welch's head.
- Let me try try it.
Need any help?
I'll take that.
Wait a minute. Oh, boy, you weren't going to me much, were you?
That sweep's mine. I've got to clean up the mess you've made around here.
- Give me that. Give me that sweeper!
- Hey, hey! Look out!
What the combination of this crib?
It's empty.
No fooling!
Well, you were looking for dirt, and you found it.
Yes? 48th Precinct,
McLane speaking.
What? Trigger Stone?
Yes, we had him cornered, but before we could close in, he winged Dugan and got away.
All right. The boys will be right over.
We've just got to find those pearls.
And how. Welch is sure to come back here tonight.
I'm ready to give up. We've searched everywhere in the house but here.
Well, then let's go though everything in this cellar.
- Oh, Mrs. Perkins?
- Oh, good evening, Mrs. Ellison.
Good evening.
Has Annie come back yet?
No, Mrs. Ellison. It's her night off.
Oh.  Thanks.
All right, you.
Lift them, you.
Keep them up. One phony move, and I'll let you have it.
- What do you want?
- Plenty.
Every cop in New York's looking for me.
I'm trapped like a rat.
- Yeah, the rat part's right.
- Shut up!
Kick in with them pearls. Another killing more or less don't mean nothing to me.
- They're not here.
- I gave theme to your kid.
- Well, she hasn't got them, and that's on the level.
- Don't kid me.
I think we've got him cornered.
He's somewhere in this block.
Watch you step, fellows.
Remember he's a killer.
Gaines, you and Bagnall take Seventh Avenue.
Conselma, you go aroud the other way.
Bucer, you take the alley.
I'll watch the street.
Kitty, kitty, kitty!
Oh, my beads!
Daddy, I found them!
Daddy, I found them!
Daddy, I found them!
Daddy!
Hey, mister, your beads were lost, but I found them.
That's fine. You're a smart girl.
Now go no, cut me loose.
Are you playing the game too?
Of course I am. You old man tied me up.
Let's you and me fool him.
Do you think that would fair?
Why, sure it would. It'll be a big joke, and we'll all bust laughing.
Now, go on. Get something and cut me loose.
Hey, not that!
Get a knife.
That's it. That's the ticket.
Now there.
That's it. Now come on.
Take it easy.
I am.
Hey, listen. Wait a minute.
You'll cut my head off.
- That's all right.
- Well, now look out.
- Where are you headed for?
- I got Trigger Stone tied up in the apartment. Come on!
Won't your dad be surprised when he find out I'm gone?
You said he's laughing.
He sure will. I let my hat in the other room.
- Hey, mister, you gave me those beads!
- Get away, you little brat!
- You gave me those beads for my birthday!
- Your birthday's over.
He gave the pearls to Shirley.
That's why he came back. Hurry!
- You bad man!
Give me back those beads
- shut up!
Give me back those beads you bad man!
Give me those beads, will ya!
Give me them!
Hey, mister!
Eddie, what's happened?
Eddie, what's happened?
- Mommy! Daddy!
- Trigger Stone! He's got Shirley!
You give me those beads!
- Mommy! Daddy! He's hurting me!
- Shut up!
Help! Daddy! Mommy!
Help! Daddy! Mommy!
- Don't be a fool! You haven't got a gun!
- Daddy, he's hurting me!
Take care of your wife.
Don't shoot!
He's using Shirley as a shield!
- Eddie, what are we going to do?
- Help! Mommy?
Daddy!
Mommy! Daddy!
- Eddie, what are we going to do?
- The roof! Come on!
- What's the matter, Eddie?
- Trigger's got Shirley on the roof! Come on.
Help! Help!
Help! Daddy!
Mommy!
- Eh, you stay here.
- Shirley!
Larry!
Bring the girl. Don't let
Tigger get out this way.
- Help! Mommy!
- Shirley! Let me go!
- I want my baby! Shirley!
- Daddy! Ow!
Eddie! Eddie!
Oh, he shot him!
- Let me go! I want my baby!
- You can't do anything out there, Kay.
I want my baby!
Let me go!
Help! Mommy! Daddy!
My baby! Let me go!
I want my baby!
He's going to hurt her!
Hey, who are you?
- I'm Inspector Welch from the National Insurance Company.
- Oh, okay.
Help! Help! Help!
Shirley! Shirley!
Mommy!
Wait a minute, Daddy.
- My baby!
- You bad man!
Here's the beads, Daddy!
Shirley! Shirley,  my baby!
- Mommy, Mommy!
- Oh, Mommy's darling. Mommy's baby.
Eddie, Eddie, are you badly hurt?
- No, it's only a scratch.
- Look, Daddy and Mommy. I got the beads.
Take charge of him, boys.
Well, well, well, well.
Just as I thought.
They were here all the time.
You didn't fool me for a minute. None of you.
All right, Flannigan.
I'll handle this from now on.
Oh, no, you won't!
From now on, you boys have got nothing to worry about.
You'll get your jobs back, and Welch will never bother you again.
And as for you, miss, you get the $5,000 reward.
Do I get the beads too?
Wait a minute.
I'm not going to stand for this.
- Oh, you won't? Well, now you listen to me, you big phony!
- Wait a minute.
I got a notion to run you in for interfering with an officer!
Now wait a minute!
Wait a minute...
SUBTITLES
Yannis, Anavissos
Taking off at 9.10.
All clear, George.
Watch for the light.
Glendale calling NC95W.
Go ahead.
NC95W answering Glendale.
I'll be in in about five minutes.
How'd you make out, Loop?
Did you get your passenger there on time?
I got him there just in time to see his wife.
Have you seen Shirley around anywheres?
No, not yet, but she'll be here.
She always is when you come in.
Where are you goin'?
I'm going to the airport.
ZJump in.
I'll give you a lift.
Thanks, mister, but I'll have to get a faster car.
I'm in a hurry.
You're the most particular hitchhiker I ever saw.
Well, thanks, anyway.
Hello, Shirley.
Goin' to the airport?
Yes, thank you.
Come on, hop in.
That-a girl.
Hello, Loop.
I bet you wish you were up there with him.
I will be someday.
Contact.
Contact.
Ha ha ha!
Come on.
Contact. Ha ha!
Hiya, Loop.
Hiya, Bill. Check the oil when you gas it.
Yowzuh.
Come on, honey.
Up you come.
There.
Hello, Shirley.
- Hello, honey. How was it, Loop?
- Hello,Jack.
A little bumpy over the hills.
Are you off again?
Sure. I'll be eating my Christmas dinner... in New York tomorrow.
Well, Merry Christmas, Shirley.
Merry Christmas and lots of tailwind.
- Ha ha ha! Thanks.
- So long.
You wait here, honey.
I'll be right back.
- Hiya, Tony.
- Good morning, sir.
Hello, fellas.
- Tony.
- Yes, missy?
You didn't dust my daddy's picture.
Here, missy.
You givin' your daddy a clean face?
Yes. Don't you think he needs it?
I think you do, too.
Here. Wet.
There you are, young lady. Come on.
My daddy could fly better... than anybody in the world, couldn't he?
That's right- better than anybody in the whole world.
You know, your daddy and I were pals... ever since we were about as big as you are.
He was my best friend.
That's why I'm your godfather.
And then one day, he cracked up... and went away to heaven, didn't he?
That's right.
I'll bet when I'm a flyer,
I won't crack up.
When you're ready to be a flyer... we're gonna buy you a great big noncrackable ship.
Say, that reminds me.
I found an old scrapbook... the other day with some pictures of your daddy and me in it.
- Would you like to see it?
- Oh, yes!
I'll get it.
- Hi, Harry. Grab some of these, will you?
- Sure.
Hello, honey.
Hello, little boy.
I'm not a little boy.
I'm a little girl.
Are you sure?
Yes, I'm sure.
Well, I just didn't want to take any chances.
Now, that's mistletoe.
And when you hold it... over anybody's head, you can kiss them.
Beat it, you chiseler.
OK, kid.
Move over.
There's your daddy on the day... he broke the transcontinental record.
And there's your daddy and me when we first got our wings.
We'll skip that.
Wait a minute.
There ought to be... another one in here someplace.
Who's that?
A girl I used to know.
She's a pretty lady.
I used to think so.
But it's not enough to be pretty here.
You've got to be pretty in here, too.
How can you be pretty in there?
By thinking the right thoughts... and doing the right things... and eating plenty of spinach. Ha ha ha!
Say, we better call up your mother... before she starts to worry about you.
She won't worry as long as I'm with you.
Fledrich 4230.
Good heavens.
Will no one answer the phone?
Hello.
May I please speak to Mrs. Blake?
Mary.
Mary.
Yes, ma'am?
The telephone- for you.
Thank you.
Hello?
This is Loop.
I just wanted you to know that Shirley's with me.
Hello, Mother.
I'll have one of the boys drive her home later.
All right, Loop.
Thanks.
Mary.
Yes, ma'am?
I don't approve of all these telephone calls.
I'm sorry.
And I don't approve of all these aviators... who keep coming here to see your little girl.
She's sort of a pet with them.
They all knew her father.
I know that, but I really can't have it.
You know it isn't everyone who'd engage a maid... with a small child.
I have no fault to find with your work... but if you want to stay on with us... you'll have to correct these things.
Yes, ma'am, I will.
Very well.
I told you when you engaged her... that it wouldn't work out.
Well, she was so pathetic about wanting a nice home... for her little girl... that I let my sympathy get the better of my judgment.
I'll let her go right after the holidays.
Hmm. Fine.
Ah. Through with the upstairs already?
Yes.
What's wrong, dearie?
Mrs. Smythe doesn't want me to have any more telephone calls.
She don't? Well, well, now, ain't that too bad.
Ha! Her and her highfalutin ways... and him that finicky.
They both give me a pain.
Tut tut, Elizabeth.
I shall not stand here... and listen to you defame our employers.
What?
Besides, I have to go down to the post office.
Ha ha ha!
Don't forget to pick up those things.
What things, my love?
Don't you remember?
The things I told you to get?
Oh, you fool, you.
The sewin' kit I told you to get for Shirley.
Oh, right.
I wanted it to be a surprise.
I guess it won't matter if you know.
ZJust a bit of a Christmas gift.
You're awfully kind.
Aw, go on.
I bought a few things for her.
Not very much, of course.
It was different when her father was alive.
Oh, yes, the poor young fellow.
Well, it must be a comfort to know... you're doin' the best you can for the little one.
She's a sweet child.
Not like that young one of theirs.
There's a brat if ever one lived.
Now, darling, don't get yourself all excited.
Child: I don't care! No! No!
No! No! No!
Darling, you must practice your piano lesson.
You won't have to practice again... until after Santa Claus has been here.
There ain't any Santa Claus!
Don't say "ain't," darling. Say "isn't. "
Ain't! Ain't! Ain't!
What's all this noise about?
Mother wants me to practice, and I don't wanna!
You must do as Mama says, dear.
Well, I ain't gonna!
Now, look here, young woman-
Remember what the psychoanalyst said-
The child mind must never be coerced.
One must use persuasion and reason.
Now, darling... practice your lesson, and mama will buy you something nice.
What?
- Anything you like.
- Anything?
Yes, dear. What would you especially like?
A machine gun!
Rat-a-tat! Rat-a-tat!
Rat-a-tat! Rat-a-tat!
Rat-a-tat!
That's a good girl.
Hey! Is there anybody at all in this confounded house?
Hey! Somebody! Anybody!
Come and help me downstairs!
Hey!
So you think you're gonna make me stay up here today, do you?
Well, I'll show you.
Oh!
Doggone it!
Why, Uncle Ned!
Why didn't you call us?
Call you?
I yelled, and I shouted and bellowed.
A fat lot of good it did me.
No one pays any attention to me.
No one cares what happens to me.
All you do is think of yourselves.
Oh, Uncle Ned, you know that isn't so.
Mary.
Yes, Mr. Smythe?
My name is Smith!
His name is Smythe.
Yes, Mr. Smith.
Didn't you hear me holler a little while ago?
No, sir, I didn't.
Folks around here had better get their ears fixed.
That's all, Mary.
? 1 and 2 and 3 and?
? 1 and 2 and 3 and?
? 1 and 2 and 3 and?
? 1 and 2 and 3 and...
1 and 2 and-?
Stop it!
? 1 and 2 and 3 and?
Is that all you know?
Mama! Mama!
Mama. Mama.
It's a good thing
I'm not your mama.
Why, it's enough to drive a man crazy.
Things better be a little different around here... or you're gonna see the last of me.
And another thing-
You stop telling people...
I made my money in sanitary engineering.
It was sewers!
Sewers! And don't you forget it!
And, oh...
How much longer must I stand this?
Now, now, dear. Be calm.
That horrid man.
He's just impossible.
Yes, I know he's trying, but after all... we can afford to be patient.
It will pay us in the end.
Any money he leaves us we'll have earned.
Yes, that's true... but with my business in such condition... we'd better keep on humoring him.
And, Mama, every time he sees me, he makes a face.
Never mind, darling.
Well, I must be getting down to the office.
- Good-bye, dear.
- Good-bye.
Good-bye, darling.
Never you mind, darling.
Don't you let him worry you.
Sit up.
Sit up.
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!
Miss Blake's car is ready, sir.
Very good, Meadows.
The royal chariot awaits, madam.
Come on.
Ha ha ha!
Bye, Ray.
I'll see you later.
Bye, honey. Bye.
Hello, Harry.
Hello, Shirley.
Hi, Shirley.
Hi.
Hello there.
Mr. Higgins?
Yes, madam?
See that?
That's mistletoe.
Thank you, madam.
- Mother.
- Yes, darling?
May I help you with the dishes?
No, honey, but I tell you what you can do.
Take this down to the incinerator... and leave it there.
All right.
Higgins, what's that on your face?
My face, madam?
Yes.
It appears to be chocolate, madam.
Look out for the police car!
Here comes the police car!
Everybody, get out of the way!
Everybody, get out of the way!
Bang! Bang! Bang!
Bang! Bang!
Why, you poor little thing.
You must have cracked up.
You should be in the hospital.
Hey, that's my doll.
Well, I just found her here.
You can't have her.
You bad old thing.
You ran away from home... and I'm gonna spank you.
If you give her to me...
I'll take care of her.
I'll wash her face... and make her some clothes and everything.
You can't have her!
You wanna know why?
Because I'm gonna kill her.
? Happy, happy, happy days?
? Happy days, happy days?
? Happy days, happy days?
? Happy days, happy-?
Hey, what are you gonna get for Christmas?
I'm gonna get a doll house with real furniture... and a little piano and a tennis racket... and a great big doll.
I asked Santy Claus to bring me a doll.
Santa Claus? Pooh!
There ain't any Santa Claus.
- There is, too.
- There is not!
There is not, because my psychoanalyst told me.
There ain't any Santa Claus.
There ain't any fairies or giants or anything like that.
I'll bet you'd feel bad... if you woke up tomorrow morning... and you didn't have any presents.
Well, I won't.
You want to know why?
'Cause I already peeked in the closet and saw 'em.
I don't care what you saw.
There is a Santy Claus.
There ain't!
Mr. Smith?
Huh?
There is a Santy Claus, isn't there?
What did she say?
She says there isn't.
Then there is.
You think you're smart, don't you?
Well, I'll show you!
You'll what?
You'll...
Aarrrgh!
Get outta here!
Go on!
Get out of here!
Go on! Get outta here!
Mama! Mama!
Mama!
Mama!
Shirley.
Shirley, where are you?
Here I am.
Oh, well, my goodness.
We got rid of her, all right.
Thanks, Mr. Smith.
Oh, that's all right.
I like you.
You're the only one around here that does.
They don't like me... and listen,
I don't like them, either.
I made the arrangements... and everything's all set for tomorrow.
It's wonderful of you and the boys... to give Shirley her Christmas party.
Oh, we're getting a big kick out of it ourselves.
She'll be so surprised.
She doesn't expect much, you know.
Now, get her down to the airport... as early in the morning as you can.
I may not be able to come with her... but I'll be down just as soon as I can get away.
That'll be fine.
Hello, Mr. Merritt.
Merry Christmas.
The same to you.
I'm just after making myself a cup of tea.
- Will you have one?
- Sure.
Ah, fine.
Hello, Loop.
Hiya, honey.
All ready for Christmas?
I've been ready for a long time.
Hello, Loop.
Hiya, Thomas.
All ready!
Come on.
Yes, dear, I think Friday will be all right.
That will be fine.
Very well. We'll make it definite, then.
Thank you so much for inviting us.
Good-bye, dear.
This is good cake.
It ought to be.
I whipped it up myself.
How are you,
Mr. Merritt?
The compliments of the season to you.
Same to you,
Mr. Higgins.
The cup that cheers but not inebriates.
Ha ha ha!
Wow! That's hot.
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!
Higgins.
Yes, madam?
My cousin's arriving from New York tomorrow... and I want you to be sure... that everything is done just right.
Yes, madam.
- Thomas, you will meet the plane in the morning.
- Yes, ma'am.
I'm very anxious to show her that we can do things... exactly as well out here as they do in the East.
I want perfect meals and perfect service.
Is that understood?
Yes, ma'am.
- And, Mary...
- Yes, ma'am?
I hope you'll remember what I told you... this morning... about visitors?
Yes, ma'am.
And I don't want to have to remind you again.
Remember that,
Mrs. Higgins-
Anything else than perfection... and, ggkktt... off goes your head.
My head, indeed.
You better look after your own.
How can you stand working for people like that?
Oh, I don't mind.
Could be worse.
Well, I guess you know your own business best.
Now we'll have a little pepper.
Good-bye, Mrs. Higgins.
Ah-choo!
I'll see you tomorrow.
OK, Loop.
Hello, dear.
Mother, I undressed myself.
I put my clothes away- all folded and everything.
Well, you're mother's precious little angel... that's what you are.
No, I'm not, because angels have wings... like these.
Those are your daddy's wings.
I know, and he's really an angel, isn't he?
Yes, darling.
Now, then. Are you all ready to hang up your stocking?
- Mother.
- Yes, dear?
You know,
I was thinking today...
- about hanging up my stocking...
- Yes? and I thought maybe... if Santa brought me a great big present- of course, he mightn't- but then if he did-
Yes, if he did?
Well, you know, my stockings are awful little.
I know. And you want mother to lend you one of hers.
Oh, no. I already borrowed one of Mrs. Higgins'.
Oh, you did?
Ha ha ha!
See? It's a real good, big one.
Santa Claus could get most anything in that.
Shall we hang it here?
Will it hold everything without falling down?
I think it will.
Now... say your prayers.
Then mother will tuck you in... you'll close your eyes and go to sleep... and then-
And then it will be Christmas.
That's right.
Now, there you are.
Dear Lord, please bless my mother and me... and Loop and all of the aviators... and Mr. and Mrs. Higgins... and Mr. and Mrs. Smythe and Mr. Smith-
Do I have to ask him to bless Joy, too?
Yes, dear.
And bless Joy, too... and make her a good girl.
- Mother.
- What, dear?
On account of this is Christmas Eve... do you think it will be all right... if I ask something special?
I'm sure it will.
Dear Lord, please see my daddy... and wish him a merry Christmas from my mother and me... and tell him we love him... forever and ever. Amen.
Mother, do you think he will?
I think on this night of all nights...
God will listen to the prayer of a child.
Don't cry, Mother.
I get lonesome for him sometimes, darling.
Don't be lonesome, mother.
You have me.
Yes, my own sweet baby.
And we're together... and tomorrow's Christmas and everything.
And it'll be a merry
Christmas, won't it?
The merriest we've ever had.
The very, very merriest.
All right.
Beddy-bye.
In you go.
There you are- nice and comfy.
Tell me again about the first Christmas.
All right.
A long, long time ago... three travelers came to an inn.
And they needed food and shelter.
Yes, but there was no room for them in the inn.
And the only place they could find to sleep... was in the stable.
In the straw... with the cows.
And there was born that night... a little baby boy.
Isn't it beautiful, dear?
Merry Christmas, Uncle Ned.
Ohhh...
Oh, look, darling.
Look, darling. Isn't she nice?
I don't want any old doll!
I wanted a wheelchair like his!
Little girls don't have wheelchairs... but you have lots of other nice things to play with.
I don't want anything else!
I want a wheelchair!
Ohh...
Look, Mrs. Higgins!
Look what Santy Claus brought me!
Oh, my! My!
Isn't she pretty?
What's her name?
Her name is Mary Lou... and Santy Claus brought me... a little man that dances when you wind him up... and a ball and some candy... and a sewing kit... with real scissors, a needle, and everything!
Santa Claus was certainly good to you.
He certainly was.
I got every single thing I asked for.
I'm pretty lucky, all right.
All right, honey.
Roy's outside waiting for you.
Now, you run along and see Loop... and mother will be down just as soon as she can.
Run along, dear.
Are you gonna take Mary Lou to the airport with you?
Do you think maybe she's too young?
Perhaps you'd better leave her here.
All right. Take good care of her while I'm away.
I certainly will, darling.
Hello, honey.
Hello.
Up you go.
You hurry down, Mother!
All right!
Hello, honey.
Hello, Thomas.
That plane flew all the way across this country... since yesterday afternoon.
And it made a 3-point landing, too.
That's right, honey.
Now, you stay here with Thomas.
I'll be right back.
Check your baggage right inside.
Hiya, Paul. We're expecting you at the club, you know.
Swell, Loop. I'll be there.
Everything all set?
Miss Martin?
- Yes?
- I'm Thomas, the Smythe chauffeur.
I was sent to meet you.
Oh, yes. Take care of my bags, will you?
Yes, ma'am.
You wait here, dear.
I know who you are.
You do?
Sure. You're the lady... who's coming to live at our house.
Well, you're not littleJoy, are you?
Oh, no. I'm Shirley.
Ha ha ha!
Oh, I see.
Come on, honey.
Loop.
How are you, Miss Martin?
Isn't she the lady... whose picture you have in your book?
Yeah. She's one of them.
You see that?
That's all for you.
For me?
- Surprise, honey!
- Surprise!
Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas!
Oh, my!
Do you like her?
Oh, my goodness!
Ha ha ha!
You'll have to give her a name, Shirley.
What are you going to call her?
Her name is going to be...
I know- Loopy!
Ha ha ha!
That's a swell name, honey.
I'll meet you, Loop, uh... you know.
Let's go, gang.
Now I've got a present for you.
This isn't from Santa Claus.
This is from me to you.
That's a magic ring, see?
ZJust like they have in the fairy tales.
Now, if ever you're in trouble... or ever you want me to do anything for you... you send me this ring, and I'll come.
It's pretty. Thanks, Loop.
How much do you love me?
Is that all?
- Mmhh!
- Ha ha ha!
I wish Mother would hurry... so she could see all I got.
She'll be here.
We're just beginning.
I do wish that man from the bakery... would get here with the cake.
He's sure to be here in a few minutes.
I don't want to miss any of the party.
No, of course you don't.
Mary, where's your little girl?
She's gone to a Christmas party.
I don't believe in Christmas.
You don't?
No. It's a lot of nonsense.
Well, I don't feel that way about it.
Well, I do!
Here-
Buy a Christmas present for Shirley from me.
Christmas! Ugh!
Now, what do you make of that?
He never fooled me.
He's only tough on the outside.
Inside he's soft as mush.
How 'bout it, Loop?
I wanted to wait for Mrs. Blake... but I guess we better get going.
When she comes, give me the flag... so I can stop and take her on.
OK, Loop.
What are we going to do?
I've got it all fixed... for you to have your party in the big ship.
Are we going to go up?
No, but we're gonna taxi all over the field.
Won't that be swell?
Oh, boy!
Come on.
We want Shirley!
We want Shirley!
We want Shirley!
Have a good time, Shirley.
- Yay!
- Yay!
Surprise!
Surprise!
Hi, Shirley.
OK, Loop.
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
Turn on the radio, Bill.
If I close my eyes...
I can make believe
I'm really flying.
Now I'm way, way up.
I wish mother was here.
This is the candyland hour...
for all good children.
The orchestra will play our theme song.
You know that song, don't you?
- Sure, I do.
- Well, then sing it. Come on.
Come on, Shirley, sing it.
? I've thrown away my toys?
? Even my drum and trains?
? I want to make some noise?
? With real-life aeroplanes?
? Someday I'm going to fly?
? I'll be a pilot, too?
? And when I do?
? How would you?
? Like to be my crew??
? On the good ship Lollipop
? It's a sweet trip to a candy shop?
? Where bonbons play?
? On the sunny beach of Peppermint Bay?
? Lemonade stands everywhere?
? CrackerJack bands fill the air?
? And there you are?
? Happy landing on a chocolate bar?
? See the sugar bowl do the Tootsie Roll?
? With the big bad devil's food cake?
? If you eat too much?
Ooh! Ooh!
? You'll awake with a tummy ache?
? On the good ship Lollipop
? It's a night trip, into bed you hop?
? And dream away?
? On the good ship Lollipop
? On the good ship Lollipop

Ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha ha!
Well, you're here at last!
Yes, ma'am.
I want you to see it.
Here you are.
Thank you, ma'am.
Merry Christmas to you.
Ohhh!
Oh, ain't that pretty?
Why, it's far too nice to eat... if you ask me.
I'll save a piece for you anyway.
Now I must dash.
- Here, I'll hand it to you.
- Thanks.
Well, good-bye, now.
Good-bye.
Bye. Have a good time.
Look out!
Aah!
That man was on the wrong side of the road.
He was going too fast.
Why don't we get the doctor?
Do you live in town here?
Yes. But she ran right in front of me.
I didn't even have a chance to put on my brakes.
Why, it's Mary!
You know her?
Yes. She works for the same people I do.
Come on, let's take her over to the curb. Give me a hand.
Who was it?
It was Mary, our maid... the mother of the little girl you saw at the airport.
Ohhh...
Fare, please.
I paid you already!
Oh! So you did!
Ha ha ha!
Hey, Loop, look!
Hey, Bill, hold it a minute.
What's the matter?
I've got bad news for you.
Well, what happened?
There's no use breaking it to her right now.
I'll tell her later.
I can't say thanks, but...
I want you to know
I appreciate you... coming down here to tell me.
Wouldn't you let me go along?
If you don't mind...
I'd rather be alone with her.
I understand.
Honey?
How much do you love me?
Mmhh!
Mmm.
I'll never forget this day.
It's the best I've ever had in my whole life.
Good-bye, Shirley.
Had a swell time... at your party.
- Bye, Shirley!
- We'll have another one soon.
Swell dance.
Good-bye, Shirley.
We have to go back.
So long, Shirley.
Bye.
Is it all over now, Loop?
No.
They have to go back to work... but we're just starting.
Now, because today is Christmas... you can do anything that you want to do.
What would you like to do best of all?
You know. Fly.
That's just what I thought.
Hey, Bill.
All right, Shirley... we're goin' for a ride... just you and I.
You mean way up high?
Yep... way up high.
Come on.
Ooh! We're going up!
That's right.
We're going way up.
Do you know where we're going?
No.
We're goin' right up to heaven.
- We are?
- Mm-hmm.
You know, Shirley... heaven's a very nice place.
If we're good, we'll all live there someday.
Yes, I know.
My mother and father are there now.
So is my daddy.
We're up pretty high now.
Are we getting near it?
We're right in it now.
It's all around us, everyplace you look.
It must be a awful big place.
It is, honey.
Shirley...
I've got somethin' to tell you.
A story?
No, not a story.
You know... ever since your daddy went to heaven... your mother's been awful lonesome for him.
Yes, I know.
Sometimes she cries and everything.
Well... today your mother got so lonesome for your daddy... that she went to see him.
All the way up to heaven?
Yep.
All the way up to heaven.
They're up there together now.
You mean... my mother cracked up, too?
Yes.
Would you take these off for the little girl?
I think I would.
What's to become of her now?
I don't suppose the Smythes will do anything for her.
Oh, not them.
They're far too selfish.
- Elizabeth-
- Huh?
No, we couldn't do it.
Oh, how I'd love to have her.
She's such a sweet child.
But if we took her... we'd have to give up our place here... and it mightn't be so easy gettin' another one.
That's what I was thinking.
Well, I've checked up.
As far as I can find out, there are no relatives.
Now what are we to do?
There's nothing for us to do.
It's no concern of ours.
We have neither a legal nor a moral responsibility.
I know that, but after all, the woman worked for us.
People will naturally expect us to do something.
Maybe one of those aviators... would like to adopt her.
Well, if they do, let them go to court.
All that we can do is to see... that the little girl is placed in an institution... where she'll be cared for.
I'll speak to judge Thompson about it.
Oh, no, you won't!
Oh. Uncle Ned!
Did I hear you say you were gonna put... little Bright Eyes in an orphan asylum?
Who?
Shirley. Bright Eyes, I call her.
I don't care what you call her.
Well, now, Uncle Ned, you see, uh...
Anita and I have talked the matter over... and we've decided... that since there are apparently no relatives... and since of course... it's impossible for us to keep Shirley-
Why is it impossible?
Well, really, Uncle Ned, you could hardly expect us... to raise our littleJoy with the child of a servant.
Servant, my eye!
She was just as good as you are.
I don't know where you get the idea... you're so high and mighty.
Why, your father was a retail butcher!
And your father started life as a bricklayer!
Why, really, Uncle Ned... you-you mustn't get so excited.
Well, I will if I want to.
Now, listen to me, you two.
I want you to understand just one thing.
If you ever expect to get anything out of me... you're going to be human enough and decent enough... to take Shirley into this house to live.
I'll pay for her board and her clothes.
Oh, that wouldn't be necessary, Uncle Ned.
Of course, Uncle Ned.
We had no idea... you felt this way about the child.
Well, I do... and if you don't want her here...
I guess I can find some other place for her.
And listen...
I can find another place for me, too.
Well, this is going to be perfectly lovely.
Well, you engaged the woman against my advice.
I told you not to do it.
Are you blaming me because the woman died... and left a child on our hands?
I'm merely pointing out-
Well, don't bother pointing anything out.
Uncle Ned?
What do you think?
I think you're an old softy.
Well, would you let them put a child like that in a home?
In my home.
You're not like those two in there.
You're more like me.
Where's Shirley now?
She's down at the airport with Loop.
Loop? Who's Loop?
Oh. He's that aviator fellow you were interested in.
Yes.
Uh-huh. Well, uh... you go down yourself and bring her back.
I'll go right now.
Whrrr!
How was the trip to Ensenada?
Terrific. I didn't have a minute to myself.
I'm gonna sleep from now on.
Hey, Bob.
That's right.
Come on. We're goin' to San Francisco right away!
Oh, boy!
How'd you like to make a livin'... flying a guy like that?
Don't squawk.
He could've said Paris!
Ha ha ha!
Whrrr!
Watch, Loop.
I'm gonna bank.
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha ha!
We should've had our belts on.
You didn't make a bank.
You did a barrel roll!
Now, always remember one thing-
If you bank too sharply, you're liable to go into a sideslip.
That's what I did, all right.
I went into a sideslip.
Oh, you!
May I come in?
Hello.
Hello. How are you, dear?
I'm fine, and I'm glad you came to see me.
Come on and see Loop.
What can I do for you?
I want to talk to you... privately.
Shirley, run over to the radio room and see... if the American Airlines ship is on time.
Why, it was on time when we asked a while ago.
Well, then, uh... run over to the hangar... and find out if they've gassed my ship.
Well, I know they did because I watched them.
Come on, take off, will you, please?
OK.
Whrrr!
Well, you might ask me to sit down.
I might.
Why are you so bitter?
You ought to know.
Can't you forget the past?
Sure. I can forget a lot of things.
I can forget that you and I were in love... and we were engaged to be married... and that you walked out on me.
All that is just as dead as this.
But I can't forget that you made a fool of me.
A man usually remembers that.
Would it make any difference... if I said I'm sorry?
Not a bit.
It's a little too late.
You didn't come all the way over here... just to tell me that, did you?
No. I came to talk about Shirley.
What about her?
The Smythes want her to come and live with them.
Now I'll tell one.
- I mean, Uncle Ned-
- Wait a minute.
You mean you and Uncle Ned sold the Smythes the idea.
They don't like it any too well... but in order to keep in good with Uncle Ned, they'll do it.
Is that right?
You're being very unfair.
Nothing doing.
You can't have her.
Don't let your feeling against me... interfere with the little girl's future.
I know her father was your best friend.
I know you love her very dearly.
If you do, you must surely see that she can't live here... in a barracks with a lot of men!
They're pretty good men.
Even so, if there was ever a time... when a child needed women around her, it's now!
Oh, I know she can't stay here... but on the other hand,
I'm not so sure... the Smythes are the right people for her to be with.
But I'm going to take care of her myself.
- What about when you go east?
- I'll take her with me.
Oh, no, you won't. Anyhow,
I'm figuring on getting a house... and hiring a woman to take care of Shirley.
But that'll take a little time, won't it?
Oh, I suppose so.
I'll tell you what I'll do.
You can take her for now, but only with the understanding... that when I get a place for her,
Shirley comes with me.
I love that baby.
I understand how you feel.
And, Loop, no matter what you think of me...
I think you're the finest man I've ever known.
There was a time I thought you were pretty swell, too.
Say, Loop,
American Airlines ship is-
Oh, now I forgot whether it's four minutes late... or four minutes early.
Never mind.
Come here.
Honey, would you like to go back... to the Smythes' house and live there?
Do I have to?
For a little while, dear.
We think you should.
Are you gonna be there?
Yes, I am, and we'll be together every day.
If you're there, it'll be fine.
I like you, and I like Mr. Smith, too.
All right. Then it's all set.
Can Loop come live with us, too?
Oh, no, dear.
ZJust at the moment...
I'm afraid that can't be arranged.
Oh, no! Not a chance!
Here, Rags. Here, Rags. Come on.
I'm gonna let you take
Rags with you, too.
Oh, goody!
Good old Ragsy.
Thanks, Loop.
Oh, that's all right.
I might as well give the dog a break, too.
Don't worry about her.
Come see her whenever you like.
Much obliged.
So long, sweets.
If you don't like it there... remember what I told you about the magic ring.
Send it to me... and I'll come and get you.
Good-bye.
Good-bye.
Good-bye, Loop.
Come on, Ragsy.
Do you have much trouble... with your little girl?
Oh, no. She's very good.
She sleeps all the time.
Well, I have to spank mine every day... and give her castor oil.
Now,just listen to her.
She's crying again!
Stop crying!
Stop this minute!
They seem to get along all right.
Why, of course.
Anyone could get along with Joy... but I still think it's a dreadful imposition.
I know, but, uh... it won't last forever.
What do you mean?
Well, we can humor
Uncle Ned for a while... and then later on,
I can convince him... that the child will be better off somewhere else.
Shirley is just one of his whims.
He'll get tired of her one of these days.
I hope so.
Well, ladies... taking your children out for an airing?
I'm taking my little girl to the hospital.
She's very sick... and I'm afraid she'll have to have an operation.
Huh. Is that so?
Yeah. They'll probably have to cut her leg off.
Maybe both legs.
And what's wrong with your child?
Nothing. She's fine.
The only thing about her is... she just won't eat her spinach.
Well, we must be going.
Come, Shirley.
Let's play hospital.
I'll be the doctor, and you can be the nurse.
I'll get a big knife out of the kitchen... and we'll operate on your doll.
I don't want Mary Lou to be operated on.
I don't care.
You have to do as I say... and play the way I want to.
- I don't, either.
- Yes, you do.
This is my house and my yard... and you're nothing but an old charity.
- I am not!
- Yes, you are, 'cause I heard my papa tell my mama.
Let's do something else.
Do you want to play a game?
What kind of a game?
Train wreck.
How do you play it?
I'll show you.
You stand right here and don't move.
All right, now, don't move.
Here comes the train!
Woo woo!
Aah aah!
Mama! Mama!
Shirley pushed me!
What's the matter with that imp?
She's a very difficult child.
Difficult? Huh!
I can think of a better word.
Uncle Ned, I think you should speak to Anita... about the way
ZJoy treats Shirley.
No use talkin' to her.
I got somethin' better up my sleeve.
What?
You'll see.
Well, it's your move.
Uh... you only got one move.
Ha ha ha!
There you are!
Look at that!
You give up?
What was it you wanted?
I don't know whether you know it or not... but I'm Shirley's godfather.
- Oh, is that so?
- Really?
So naturally I want to do the best I can for her.
Yes, of course.
When you wanted her to stay here and live with you...
I thought it would be a good idea.
I knew you'd be nice to her.
It isn't hard to be nice to such a sweet child.
I'm glad you feel that way... because Shirley means more to me than anybody else... in the world.
That's why I thought
I'd come and ask you-
Yes?
I want to take her to live with me.
And I hope you'll let me have her.
What's that?
Hey, what's all this?
Why-
Let me explain, dear.
You're that aviator fellow, ain't ya?
That's right.
I don't like airplanes.
Well, I don't like wheelchairs.
Well, you stay in the airplane business... and you'll wind up in one.
What's he doin' here?
Well... you see, Uncle Ned...
Mr. Merritt thinks it's a good idea... for Shirley to live with him.
What?! He wants to take
Shirley away from here?
Are you married?
No, I'm not.
How much do you make?
Enough to support myself.
Where do you live?
At the airport.
Where do you eat?
In restaurants.
You've got a lot of nerve, young fella.
How can you take care of a child... when you haven't got a home or a wife or even a cook?
Well, maybe I've got something else she needs.
- What?
- Love, that's what.
Aw, fiddlesticks!
We all love her here, don't we?!
Yes, Uncle Ned.
Well, you can't have her!
- Who says so?
- I say so.
I've got more right to her than you have.
Aw, nonsense. You haven't any right at all.
Well, we'll see about that!
Hey, young fella!
If you want to see about it... you see my lawyers!
Lawyers?
Lawyers?
That's what I said. Lawyers.
I'm taking legal steps to adopt Shirley.
Good heavens!
So that's where he went yesterday.
You can't get away with this!
Oh, I can't, eh?
No! I'm gonna give you a fight!
I'll get lawyers myself!
We'll let the court decide!
Is that so?
You haven't got money enough to fight me!
I'll get it. I don't care if you've got $90 million!
You're not gonna take
Shirley away from me!
Ha! I've got the best lawyers in the country!
Ha ha ha!
Loop!
You put one over on me again, didn't you?
No. I didn't.
I didn't know about it.
You expect me to believe that?
Yes.
OK.
Loop, from now on,
I'm on your side.
Why?
Because if Shirley means so much to you... then you're the one who should have her.
For a child, love counts more than anything.
ZJust for a child, huh?
For anyone.
I'm glad you found that out.
There, now.
Pleasant dreams, dear, and go right to sleep.
I don't want to go to sleep... but I'll try.
That's a good little girl.
Good night, Shirley.
Good night, Mrs. Smythe.
And remember, Shirley...
I don't want to have to speak to you again... about having that awful little dog in your bed.
It isn't healthful.
And besides,
I think the dog has fleas.
Oh, no. He hasn't got fleas.
He just scratches that way because he's itchy.
Well, I don't want him here in this bedroom.
Is that understood?
Yes, ma'am.
Good night,Joy, darling.
Hey!
What?
Do you want to play burglars?
No. I want to go to sleep.
Come on, Rags.
Ooh! You've got that awful dog in your bed... after mommy told you not to!
I'm gonna tell.
Mama!
You don't have to yell for your mother... and you don't have to tell her, either... you old tattletale.
I'll take Rags downstairs.
Come on, Rags, good old dog.
I thought about it and thought about it... and I'll be hanged-
Pardon me, dear- if I know what to do.
The minute I heard him say he'd seen his lawyers...
I felt a cold chill go down my back.
He may have changed his will.
He may have left us out of it entirely.
Oh, it's intolerable.
Yes, you're right, dear... and all because he took a fancy... to a 5-year-old orphan.
There's been nothing but trouble... ever since that child came into this house.
I wish we'd never seen her.
If you'd only taken my-
Now, don't tell me again that it's all my fault... for hiring the woman.
All right, dear.
Well, what are we going to do about it?
If we could find some way of getting rid of the child.
Heaven knows she's not wanted here.
Why don't you bribe that aviator fellow... to take her out of the state?
Now, that's an idea.
But what would
Uncle Ned think?
Oh, I don't know.
I'm so sick of hearing that child's name, I could scream.
She's practically disrupted the family.
I know, dear. But we've got to find some way out of it.
Say, what's a three-letter word... for Peer Gynt's mother?
What's the matter,
Loop? You low?
How could I make some money?
What for?
Well, I gotta hire some lawyers.
Why don't you marry the girl?
Cut out the wisecracks, will you? I'm serious.
I don't know, Loop.
Flyers never have any money.
You know that.
Yeah, I know it.
Wow! What a night!
Heavy weather, huh?
Terrific.
I hear everything's on the ground.
Nothing moving.
That's right.
Zero zero all along the line.
Boy, oh, boy.
Hello, everybody.
Shirley!
What's happened?
Shirley, what are you doing out... on a night like this?
Why, you're soakin' wet.
Come on, now. You gotta get those clothes off and dried out.
Hello.
Hello, honey.
Hello, Shirley.
Are you all dressed?
Yes.
Did you dry yourself off good?
- I did.
- OK.
Ha ha ha!
You sure look swell.
They fit you fine.
Now, then... what's the big idea?
I don't want to live with the Smythes anymore, Loop.
I want to stay with you.
I want you to stay with me, Shirley.
And I'm gonna try and fix it so you can.
Oh, goody!
Now, then... off you go to sleep... and we'll talk everything over tomorrow.
You're not mad at me for coming here... are you, Loop?
Yes, I am very, very mad.
Ha ha ha!
Come on.
Ha ha ha!
? Ohhh?
? He flies through the air?
? With the greatest of ease?
? This daring young man?
? On his flying trapeze?
? Well, his movements were graceful?
? The girls he would please?
? This daring young man?
? On his flying trapeze?
Well, good morning, Anita.
Good morning, Uncle Ned.
Good morning,John.
Good morning, Uncle Ned.
Beautiful morning, isn't it?
Do you feel all right, Uncle Ned?
My boy, I never felt better in my life.
Tony!
I sent him out for some breakfast, Loop.
What's the matter?
Aren't you workin'?
Not today. I'm no hero.
Aw, it's not that tough, is it?
Ladies and gentlemen, here's news of national import.
Two mail planes are reported missing...
in the worst storm the West has known in years.
A blizzard is raging over the Rockies...
which has completely disrupted rail and air traffic.
All transcontinental passenger planes...
have been ordered grounded until the weather breaks.
That's 30 for this morning.
This is Sam Hayes speaking.
I'll see you tonight at 10.00. Good day, all.
I'm ready for breakfast now, Loop.
I was gonna have some chow brought down... but I guess we'll have to go and get it.
And then, young lady, you're going to have to go home.
Oh, Loop.
Why can't I stay here?
Can't you be a soldier and stick it out for a little while?
I don't want to.
You don't want to live in a swell house... go to a nice school, and be educated and refined?
I don't want to be refined.
I want to be like you.
All right.
Let's eat and talk it over.
Now, come on. Bundle up warm.
Well, children,
I want you to know... that I'm about to change my will.
I'm adopting Shirley... and I'm setting aside a trust fund for her.
What?
You two have nothing to worry about... so long as you behave yourselves.
Mama!
Mama!
Mama!
Mama! Mama!
- Shirley's gone!
- What?
Yeah! She didn't sleep in her bed all night...
'cause I woke up and looked.
She must've run away!
She wouldn't have run away without some reason!
Did you have anything to do with this?
Why, of course not, Uncle Ned.
She's gone to that aviator fella!
Get police! Get detectives!
Get the army!
But go to that airport and bring her home!
Yes, Uncle Ned.
There'd better be some action around here now...
I'll tell you that!
You see, honey?
Man's just learning what the birds knew all the time.
What?
You never saw birds fly in bad weather, did you?
They have too much sense for that.
Listen. Am I working for you, or you working for me?
I'm workin' for you.
Well, then you listen to me.
This has gotta be in New York tomorrow.
It means a lot of money to me.
You're gonna fly it there.
Not me.
What do you mean, not you?
I mean the weather's too bad.
There won't be one ship take off from here today.
- It's too dangerous.
- You don't understand.
This has got to be in New York tomorrow.
That's all I know.
Well, I'm sorry, it can't be done.
I've got a wife and two children... and they mean more to me than this job.
You mean I gotta get someone else?
You sure do.
All right. You're through.
I'd give $1,000 for this flight.
There must be someone around that wants that kind of money.
You won't get anyone to fly today.
Well, that's my worry.
I'll find somebody.
Oh, my! Come on!
Come on, Rags.
Who's Loop Merritt?
I am.
You fly to New York for me?
Not today.
They told me you were a flyer with plenty of nerve.
Nerve is one thing, and being crazy is another.
Anybody who takes a ship up today is crazy.
There's $1,000 in it for you.
I could use 1,000, all right.
Mister, you got a bet.
This has to be delivered in
New York tomorrow morning.
Leave the check in the office with Major Moseley.
I'll do that right now... and I'll meet you in my hangar in 10 minutes.
You're not really gonna fly today, are you, Loop?
I sure am.
Don't be crazy.
You'll kill yourself!.
Didn't you ever need money so badly... you were willing to risk your life for it?
Sure, but on a day like-
I know, but I need $1,000, and I need it for a good reason.
No one should fly in this weather.
I fly better in weather like this.
Eddie, come here.
Take Shirley home, will you?
Sure, Loop.
So long, baby.
Be a nice fella and wait till I get back.
I'll wait right here for you.
Oh, no. You have to go home.
No. I'm never going back there.
Aw, Shirley. I'm making this flight to get money... so that I can take you and keep you with me always.
But for now, you'll have to go back to the Smythes'.
Won't you do that for me?
All right, Loop... but hurry back.
You wait in here out of the wind, honey.
I'll be right back.
So long, Loop. Lots of luck.
Why don't you call it off, Loop?
Nothin' doin'.
Hey,just a minute!
Where's Shirley?
Don't tell me you're worried.
Never mind the funny stuff.
If you've got that kid... you're in a tough spot.
Well, wise guy, I haven't got her.
I sent her home.
She'll be at your house before you get there.
You sent her home?
Yes, I sent her home!
You know I could have you arrested for kidnapping.
We'll take that up at the next meeting.
So long, fellas.
- Well, where is she?
- Isn't she here?
- She is not.
- She ought to be.
Sure, she should be, but she isn't.
Are you a detective?
Yes, sir.
Well, I'm not, but if I was one...
I'd figure out where she is.
Now, Mr. Smythe-
Smith's my name!
You know what I think?
I didn't know you could think!
I think that aviator took her with him.
He was going on a flight when we got there.
Say, that's right!
You say he was goin' away?
- Yes.
- Sure, he's got her!
He's taken her with him!
Call the police!
Call my lawyers!
Now, take it easy, Uncle Ned.
Ah, get out.
Hurry, man! Hurry!
Have them in a moment,
Mr. Smith.
Hello. This is Hall speaking.
I want to report a kidnapping.
I'll spend $10,000-
Anything to get her back safe and sound.
Burbank, Burbank. Zero zero.
Dense fog. Zero.
Temperature 50.
Dew point 50.
Barometer 29.80.
Winds west 3.
All airports have been asked to notify police...
if plane NC13843 lands.
The pilot,James Merritt...
is suspected ofkidnapping
Shirley Blake...
5 years old.
Ha! Ha ha!
Ha ha ha ha!
Shirley! Come here.
How did you get in here?
I got in where the baggage goes.
Don't be mad, Loop.
This is the first time in my life...
I ever felt like spanking you.
Didn't you tell me to send you this ring... if I wanted you to come get me?
That's right.
Well, I was going to send it... but I couldn't get it off, so I brought it myself. See?
You certainly picked a fine time to do it.
Now, what's the idea?
I want to be with you, Loop.
All airport offiicials have been asked...
to report the arrival of plane NC13843.
You know, we're really in trouble.
Loop, you're not awful mad at me, are you?
Yes, I'm very mad at you.
Well, I guess I won't be very long.
That's right. But be sure... and keep me posted if anything happens.
Well?
There isn't any news.
I blame you two for this.
If you hadn't been so selfish... if you'd just been a little kinder... that child would never have left here.
You people have everything to make life worthwhile- youth and health and money.
And yet you were too mean and too narrow to share it... with a little child who had nothing... but who had more than you'll ever have.
Well, if anything happens to her...
I'm through with you for good and all.
Is it always bumpy like this?
It isn't bumpy till you hit your head on the top.
Say, reach in my pocket and get a stick of gum.
Isn't this great?
Uh-huh.
Give me half.
Say, what was that
"Lollipop" song?
Go ahead and sing it.
? On the good ship Lollipop?
? It's a sweet trip...?
?... Bonbons play?
? On the sunny beach of Peppermint Bay?
NC13843 calling.
NC13843 abandoning ship.
Broken gas line.
Approximate position-
Can you hear me?
It's dead.
What's the matter, Loop?
Do you love me?
Of course, Loop.
How much?
Oh, you can hug me tighter than that...
'cause we're bailin' out.
Hold tight.
Are you all right, honey?
Sure!
Let's do it again.
And in conclusion, your honor... my client feels that he is the best qualified... and most fit person to have the custody of this child.
He therefore prays... that you grant him the right of adoption.
ZJames Merritt.
Yes, your honor?
Aren't you represented by counsel?
No, sir.
Well, you've heard all about the advantages...
Mr. Smith can give Shirley.
What have you to offer?
Not very much.
I haven't a lot of money, and I haven't a fine home.
But I love Shirley, and I know she loves me.
I'd do anything in the world for her.
Judge: Come on up here by me, Shirley.
Up she goes. Yeah.
Well, looks as though you... are a very popular young woman.
Now, it's my duty to decide who is going to adopt you... but I think you should have something to say about it... don't you?
Yes, I do.
Now, uh... which of these people would you like to live with?
I'd like to live with him.
And I'd like to live with him, too.
And her, too.
Well, it seems to me that this case... can be settled without attorneys.
Will all the lawyers in the courtroom please leave?
Now, suppose we adjourn to my chambers.
Come on, dear.
Oh, not you, Mr. Merritt... nor you, Mr. and Mrs. Smythe.
I just want to talk to Mr. Smith and the young lady.
Mama, do we have to have... that old Shirley living with us again?
Darling, please, be quiet.
But, mama, do we?
Shh! Shh!
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
Well, Mr. Merritt...
I've been making some inquiries... and I'm not so sure-
Would you please step in here?
You told Shirley if she was ever in trouble... to send you this ring.
Well, I want to see if it's really a magic ring... because I'm in trouble.
You want Shirley... and I want Shirley.
If you think hard for a minute... can't you figure a way out?
I don't get you at all.
Oh, dear. Do I have to propose?
Well, I did the last time.
Oh, Loop.
No. You don't have to propose.
Maybe all this happened for a good reason.
And this time, it'll last forever.
Well, Uncle Ned, who got Shirley?
We did.
Come up and see us sometime.
Oh, Papa, now we don't have to... be nice to Uncle Ned anymore!
# Happy ending #
# With all our troubles behind #
#Happy ending #
# That's what we're trying to find #
# Why didn't Cinderella waver #
# What made her braver #
# She knew the prince would come and save her #
# Happy ending #
# The best of wonderful times #
# Always ending #
# Just like in nursery rhymes #
# May each thing you pray for #
# Bring you joy and laughter #
# Ever after #
# Happy ending to you all ##
And now for a very important announcement.
Wednesday night at 8:00 over the Federal Broadcasting
Company's coast-to-coast network... the Crackly Grain Flakes Company bring you something new in entertainment... tomorrow's sensation of the airwaves,
Little Miss America.
# You got to eat your spinach, baby #
# That's the proper thing to do #
# It will keep you kind of healthy too #
# And what it did for Popeye it will do for you #
# You got to eat your spinach #
Kent, our program starts next week... and you haven't found me a Little Miss America yet.
I'm beginning to lose faith in the whole idea.
- Mr. Bartlett, if you'll just be patient...
- Patient? Patient?
Look. Look.
All this advertising.
What I can't understand is how you had the colossal nerve... to spread publicity from coast to coast... before you found the right child for the program.
Wait a minute.
You turned down some talented kids... and some of them were very successful radio entertainers.
That's just what was wrong with them.
They weren't what the program calls for, and you know it.
If this thing blows up after it's been announced all over the country... it'll be an irreparable blow to the prestige of Crackly Grain Flakes... and, Kent, I won't have it!
Take your hands off my child.
I will if she'll take her teeth out of my hand.
- You worm. I'll have the Humane Society up here.
- Let go. Ooh!
Say, what do you got in that bag?
I carry it for luck.
Glad you took the horse off it.
Quiet!
Quiet!
Quiet! Now, listen!
Listen!
Now, listen, please! Quiet, ladies!
You'll have to wait your turn:
You sure you got the song right?
Yew, Uncle Harry, but I'm awfully hungry.
Shh. Not so loud. We'll be eating regular soon as I hand these guys the old one-two.
You better not, Uncle Harry.
The last time you gave the old one-two, you came home with a black eye.
That was a crooked game, and can prove it.
Well, honey, when do we start broadcasting?
It's my guess you've never stopped.
Don't be that way, sweetheart.
Isn't this the place that advertised for a kid?
I have here the most sensational, the most extraordinary and thrilling...
So you're another one of those.
I'm afraid you're too late.
Harry Kipper is never too late.
All right, hotshot. Have it your own way.
Child's name and address.
Rebecca Winstead,
950 10th Avenue.
- Where's the man in charge?
- That door.
Thanks, sister.
I'll be seeing you oh the way out.
I can't wait.
You'll have to excuse him.
I've told him not to act that way.
Oh, that's all right.
I'm used to it.
- Would you like some candy?
- Thank you.
We'd really get further in our act if he wouldn't talk so much.
- Is he in the act with you?
- No, I'm the act. He's my manager.
I bet you'd make a better manager than your father.
Uncle Harry's not my father.
He's my stepfather.
I've been taking care of him ever since Mother died.
- Oh, you poor child.
- I'm not a poor child.
- You know, I'm very self-reliant.
- You are?
Yes. My mother told me to always be that way.
Well, Kent, what are we waiting for now?
I'll see what's holding them up.
Orville, let's go.
Okay, chief.
What are you going to sing, little girl?
Frorabelle will now sing
"You Got to Eat Your Spinach, Baby."
Do they all have to sing that song?
Give it to them, Florabelle.
- Now, honey.
- # You got to eat your spinach, baby #
# That's the only thing to do #
Come on.
Snap in to it, sweetheart.
Snap in to it.
#You got to eat your spinach#
"Baby," isn't it?
It's "baby," isn't it? Yes, "baby."
Come on, honey.
You can do better than that. Now-
Mike fright, eh? I know just how you feel. It happened to me once.
- What's she doing that for?
- Stage fright. She can't help it.
What's stage fright?
Well, it's, um-
It's something you'll never get.
- Why?
- Because I trained you. That's why.
You're a trouper.
That kid's just an amateur.
Stop it. Stop it. You're killing me.
If it wasn't for setting a bad example for Florabelle...
I'd pin your ears back.
Come on, doll.
I have here the most sensational, most extraordinary and thrilling-
Say, do you get stage fright?
- No, I'm a trouper.
- Have you got adenoids?
No, but I'll get some if you want them.
Okay. You're next.
Play it good, professor.
Your search is over, son.
If I do say so myself, this child is the most, uh-
Clever child. Clever child.
All right. Go to it.
#What is all this dizzy busy hustling for#
#People running helter-skelter on their way#
# What is all this hazy crazy bustling for #
# No time to notice it's a sunny day #
# Why don't you take a vacation #
# Looks like you've got to have relaxation #
# Aw, come on, forget your troubles for a while #
# Why don't you try to feel like I do #
# If I had one wish to make #
#This is the wish I would choose #
That's great!
Just what I've been looking for
No need to look further.
She's perfect.
Okay, Orville.
That's enough.
I'm sorry, honey.
I guess you're not the type.
I can change my type.
I'm very self-reliant.
But you didn't even let her finish her song!
The chief said he's heard enough, and he's giving orders around here.
Why, he's passing up the most colossal, the most in-
You told him that once before,
Uncle Harry, and it didn't do any good.
That's very true, my child, very true.
You don't know talent when you see it.
It's people like you that'll put radio on the spot today.
Why, at this rate, the big networks will be bankrupt within a year!
Radio Center will be as empty as your head!
Thousands of employees will be thrown out of work, and all because of you!
Bah!
I do all that?
You can't come in here!
You'll have to get out.
Now, please.
- How'd you make out, honey?
- The man said I wasn't the type.
There's nothing wrong with your type.
It's your environment that's not so hot.
Then maybe I should have my- my environment fixed.
- Come, come. Enough of this slumming.
- Hmm.
My goodness.
I thought we were wowing them.
Well, I guess it's time to go home.
It may interest you to know, Rebecca, that we have no home.
That foul landlady locked us out this morning.
Uncle Harry, why are landladies always doing that to us?
It won't happen again. I'm going to give your other relatives a chance to feed you.
Oh, goody!
You mean we’re going to have dinner?
I mean I'm taking you to your
Aunt Miranda's at Sunnybrook Farm.
From now on, you're living with her
But, Uncle Harry, I want to stay here and be a success like my mother wanted me to.
Well, I've done all can for you.
I taught you all know.
Yes. I guess it just wasn't enough.
Good-bye, Mr. Bartlett. I'm glad everything's turned out so well.
So am I, Kent. And don't let anything happen to that little girl.
Without her, there's no program.
- Just tune in next Wednesday night.
- I'll be glued to that radio.
- Yes?
- Okay for the next kid, chief?
What do you mean "the next kid"? Bring in the little girl that just sang, and fast.
Well, I didn't think-You didn't-
I didn't think you liked her.
- She just left.
- She just-What? Get her back here!
I want that kid right now!
Oh, of all the stupid, dumb morons
- Who, me?
- Oh, hello, Lola:
Well, that's a fine greeting after last night's stand-up.
I'm sorry, Lola.
I was busy. I forgot.
I waited three hours for you.
- I said I'm sorry.
- You still haven't told me where you were.
Lola, can't you understand?
I've been busy, and when I say "busy,"
I mean crazy.
I've had kids in my hair day and night.
Now, please don't make it any worse!
- Well, you needn't scream.
- Who's screaming?
Hello. Stoddard?
Did you see a big girl with a little man?
I mean, a little man with a big girl. l-
What's that? They're down there?
Hold them! Stop them! Yes.
Send them back to Kent's office right away.
Oh, Myrtle,
I thought I made a mistake.
Impossible.
All right, all right.
If you insist, then I wasn't working.
I was out with a blonde, a beautiful, gorgeous, luscious blonde.
And we're going to be married next week.
Are you satisfied?
Ah, Tony, we're crazy fighting like this.
It's okay, chief.
They're on their way back up here.
Oh. Hello, Lola.
Hello, love of my life.
Aw, cut it out, Lola.
Can I help it if go all pieces when I see you?
The man and the little girl are here, Mr. Kent.
Oh!
Well, come right in. I'm certainly glad we caught you in time.
When they tapped me on the shoulder,
I thought it was the cops.
But, chief, she isn't-
That isn't-
Keep quiet, Orville. Lola, I want you to get a load of this kid's voice.
She's sensational. Sing me that last chorus of your song, honey.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Please. Oh, wait till he finds out.
- Just listen to this.
- Chief, chief.
Let her go, Florabelle!
#You got to each your spinach, baby #
- Oh.
- Come on. Pull yourself together, sweetheart!
Ouch!
- # You got to eat your spinach #
- That's plenty.
- That's plenty.
- Well, this guy-
- I said that's enough.
- This bird here-
You'll be hearing from me very soon, very soon indeed.
- This guy told us...
- I'll be calling you up someday.
- But this fellow-
- Yes, yes. Good-bye. Good-bye.
- I am going to cut you up and sell you for bait.
- It wasn't my fault.
Do you realize if we don't find that kid,
Bartlett cancels everything?
Careful, Tony. Remember your apoplexy.
I gotta run now, darling.
- Bye, Casanova.
- Good-bye, Lola.
I gotta hand it to you, Orville.
I've been out on a limb before, but I've never had a guy behind me sawing it off.
You realize we're on the worst spot of the century?
You've got nothing to worry about, chief.
We've got the kid's address.
- You have?
- Of course. We've got all their addresses.
- Yes?
- Did you get the addresses of every one of the applicants?
- Yes.
- Well.
That's a load off my mind.
Whew. I'm dead.
Between you and Lola and getting this program set, I'm going screwy.
Why don't you take a run down to Atlantic City for a few days?
Atlantic City. That's the sort of place
I'm trying to get away from.
I'm going up to my farm where I can relax.
Birds, trees, new-mown hay, the simple life.
Well, anyway, that's what I need.
Oh, when you find that kid, be sure you get the contract signed.
Pay her anything she wants!
Well, within reason.
If you make any mistakes,
I'm going to tear your head off and use it for a doorstop.
- Okay, chief. You know me.
- I'm still regretting it.
Now you're going to meet your Aunt Miranda.
I wonder if she'll like me.
You be nice to her, and she'll be nice to you.
Uncle Harry... is this where my mother used to live when she was a little girl?
Yup.
I think I'm going to like it here.
Wait for me.
How do you do?
I guess you must be my Aunt Miranda.
Heavens above.
It's Bess's child.
- How did you ever get here?
- Oh, we drove up on the village bus.
"We"? Who's we?
Why, Uncle Harry and I.
There ought to be a law against loose planks.
- It's a miracle I'm still alive.
- It's no miracle.
It's a calamity. I suppose you want something, as usual.
Let's not start by quarreling, Miranda.
I'm only going to be here a few minutes.
That's long enough for me.
My, this is a very fine boarding house.
This is no boarding house, honey.
I thought everyone took in roomers.
A nice environment you've given her.
I want to have my environment fixed.
- I'll wager the child hasn't had a bit of food.
- Oh, yes, I have.
Uncle Harry bought me a candy bar.
Candy bar?
Take the child in the kitchen and get her something decent to eat.
- Oh, I can help myself.
I'm very self-reliant.
- I'm hungry too.
Let's go together, huh?
My name's Rebecca Winstead.
What's yours?
- I'm Gwen Warren. We're first cousins.
- Oh, are we?
My, it's nice to get-out in the country again.
You certainly have a cozy little place here, Miranda.
Get to the point, Harry.
Well, Miranda, it's this way.
I've had Rebecca on my hands for some time now.
It's been quite a burden. Of course,
I'm only too glad to take care of the child.
Although she really isn't my own, you might say.
But lately I've had several financial reverses, and I thought-
You're trying to tell me you want me to take the child off your hands.
I'd hardly put it that way, Miranda, but that's the general idea.
Listen to me, Harry Kipper.
I'll take Rebecca, but only on one condition.
Promise to let me have her for good, so
I can give her the right kind of upbringing.
I don't want her to come to a bad end like her mother.
Now, now, your sister didn't do so bad.
- You're just against show people.
- Show people!
If Bess hadn't eloped with that opera singer who died without a cent... she wouldn't have had to marry a no-good like you!
- Now, Miranda.
- Don't you "Now, Miranda" me!
Will you promise not to come back here if I take the child?
It's a sacrifice, but I'll go for anything that's good for Rebecca.
- You know me, Miranda.
- Yes, I know you.
- You're probably in a hurry. Good-bye.
- Oh, just one more thing.
I've been sort of short lately, and I thought that maybe-
I wouldn't lend you a cent if it was to save your life, Harry Kipper.
Well, no harm in asking.
Aunt Miranda, you certainly are a good cook.
- Bye-bye, Rebecca. Don't miss me too much.
- I won't, Uncle Harry.
Well, see you folks in church.
Maybe it's for the best.
He has been an awful trial to me.
- Take her up to the side room.
- Come on, darling.
As long as you live here, you'll wear your hair this way.
I like it.
It's so nice and cool.
I wore my hair that way when I was a little girl.
- My, I bet you were pretty.
- Now, get along.
See what you can learn about farming.
All right. I'll introduce myself to the chickens.
I was considered quite a belle in my day.
I'll bet you kicked up your heels when you were young.
The idea.
Stuff and nonsense.
Oh, you poor little thing.
I hope you're all right.
Oh, you bent your tail.
I'll fix it. I'm surprised Aunt Miranda lets you wear it curled.
I'll bet you haven't had any breakfast.
I'll ask Aunt Miranda to give you some eggs and bacon.
Oh, there's your breakfast!
Hurry up, or there won't be any left.
Oh, that's the wrong way.
Come back!
Please come back!
You'll get lost:
For heaven's sake, where are you?
Don't you want your breakfast?
You're a very naughty pig.
Well, hello, stranger.
What's your hurry?
I'm sorry, but I was trying to catch our pig.
- Don't you know you're trespassing?
- What's that mean?
It means you're very welcome.
Thank you, but I must catch our pig.
Wait. I'll round him up.
You stay here andhead him off.
Aunt Miranda! Gwen!
- Aunt Miranda! Gwen!
- Rebecca, what's the matter?
- They fell in the well.
- Who fell in the well?
A pig and the man with the long legs.
- Something wrong, Miss Gwen?
- Someone fell in the well.
- Perhaps it's Homer.
- No, ma'am. There's Homer now.
- Hello Gwen. What's all the rumpus?
- There's a man down there.
It's my boss.
Are you hurt, Mr. Kent?
- We're all right. Get a rope.
- Let's use the hose.
Ouch:
You might have at least taken the nozzle off.
Okay. Haul away.
Everybody, pull.
- Thank you.
- Oh, don't mention it. Nothing at all.
Whew.
I hope you'll pardon my appearance.
I didn't expect callers.
I'm glad you're not hurt.
Or are you?
I'm afraid so.
There's a strange feeling right here.
Oh, I hope it doesn't hurt you too much.
You better let Gwen and me put you to bed.
That would be a pleasant experience.
I think Homer can handle the situation.
Come on, darling.
I'm sorry she bothered you Mr...
Kent is the name. Anthony Kent. I live here, but this is my first trip of the year.
I hope you'll bother again soon.
I've got a lot of other tricks.
I'd love to see them.
Will you do one now?
I'd better clean up first.
How 'bout tomorrow?
Perhaps. Come on, darling.
- Homer, see the ladies to the door.
- Yes, sir.
I'll hold the pig.
Over we go.
Gwen! Haven't I told you to keep out of that place?
The place is all right, Auntie.
In fact, it's quite nice.
- Besides, I had to help Rebecca.
- What were you doing in there?
Now, Miranda, it wasn't her fault.
- Your pig ran away, and she had to chase it.
- Is that my pig?
- Yes, Aunt Miranda.
- Tell that man to give it to Aloysius.
But he's right here.
Why don't you tell him?
'Cause I refuse to speak to him.
Aunt Miranda says for you to give the pig to Aloysius... and she refuses to speak to you.
I'm used to it. She's refused to speak to me for 25 years.
You can tell Homer Busby he's not fit to touch my pig... and he's a no-good loafer!
You're not fit to touch our pig, and you're no-good loafer.
- But I don't think so.
- I'm glad someone's got a kind word for me.
See you again soon, Rebecca.
- Tell him he will not!
- Oh, yes, I will.
After this, stay on your own side of the fence!
Such people!
- What does Homer do?
- He takes care of Mr. Kent's place.
Why doesn't
Aunt Miranda like him?
Well, a long time ago, Homer asked Aunt Miranda to marry him.
- Is that why she's mad at him?
- Not exactly.
You see, Homer celebrated so much the night before that he forgot to go to the wedding.
Mr. Kent is very nice too.
Don't you think?
We were talking about Homer.
Come on. Help me pick berries.
Oh, Aloysius, give Rebecca a pail and show her how to pick berries.
Yes, ma'am. It's a pleasure.
Yes, ma'am. It's a pleasure.
Now, honey, you just watch me.
# If I had one wish to make #
# This is the wish I would choose #

- See who's at the door, Homer.
- Yes, sir.
- Why hello there.
- How do you do, Mr. Busby?
I would like to see Mr. Kent.
Well, that might be arranged.
Come right on in.
- I'll tell him you're here.
- Thank you.
You may tell him
Miss Winstead is calling.
Well, that would make it more official.
Uh, that little girl from next door wants to see you, Mr. Kent.
- Oh, so I see.
- You said you'd announce me as Miss Winstead, Mr. Busby.
You'll have to forgive Homer,
Miss Winstead. He's out of practice.
- Oh, that's all right.
- Won't you have some breakfast with me?
We had our breakfast a long time ago... but if it were lunch,
I would love to.
Lunch it is then.
Homer, lunch for the lady.
I'll try. You know how the cook is about digging up things at the last minute.
The servant problem gets more difficult every day, don't you think?
I guess it must be terrible.
- Will you have a glass of milk?
- Thank you. I'd like that.
You have an awfully pretty house, Mr. Kent.
I'm glad you like it,
Miss Winstead.
My, but that's good.
Don't look now, Miss Winstead, but there's milk on your nose.
Dear me. I don't know how it could have gotten there.
- May I?
- I guess you better.
- Ah. There you are.
- Thank you.
Not at all.
Awfully glad you dropped in.
- I can stay for a minute.
- Do you have to hurry?
Aunt Miranda won't like it if I'm gone too long. She's sold-fashioned.
Oh. I know just what you mean.
I knew you would if I explained it to you.
This is all I could dig up.
Oh, that's all right.
I eat most anything.
My, Mr. Kent, but I'm having a good time.
So am I, Miss Winstead.
I've never enjoyed entertaining a lady so much before.
Thank you.
You may call me Rebecca, if you like.
And I'd appreciate it if you'd call me Tony.
Pardon me, madam. Miss Gwen is here and says your lunch is ready at home.
Homer, where are your manners?
Ask her in.
I hope Gwen will like it here as much as I do.
Rebecca, I grow fonder of you by the minute. Hello there.
I'm sorry to intrude... but Aunt Miranda got worried when Rebecca didn't come home for lunch.
I'll take the blame. Rebecca dropped in for a call, and I insisted that she stay.
- Won't you sit down?
- I'm afraid I can't.
You better, Gwen.
The food's awful good.
You really can't afford to pass this up.
All right, but no lunch for me, and
I can only stay a minute.
That's what I said, and I'm still here!
Believe it or not, I was hoping
I'd see you today.
I always say neighbors should be, well, uh, neighborly.
- What do you always say?
- I always say that depends on the neighbors.
I can see we're going to get along great:
Hello. Could you direct me to Mr. Kent's house, please?
- You're looking right at it, bub.
- Oh, thanks.
Just a minute.
I'll have to introduce you first.
Aw, come on. This is important.
I'm Mr. Kent's assistant.
Hold your horses, bub, and wait till I introduce you.
Keep your eye on him, Al.
- I got my eyes right on him.
- How do you like... Ooh!
Would you mind pointing that the other way?
There's a sort of a simple-looking person outside.
Says he's got to see you.
Claims he's your assistant.
- Orville? Will you excuse me a moment?
- Sure.
- Could I get you some more turkey, madam?
- No, thank you.
I think I have enough.
Well, Orville, I didn't expect to see you down here.
- Nothing's wrong, I hope.
- No, everything's going to be okay.
You did find the kid all right, didn't you?
- Well, it's this way. See, the detectives-
- Did you find that kid?
- Now, don't get excited.
- Did you find her?
- Chief, there are a lot of other kids.
- Quit stalling, Orville.
- What's happened?
- Well, chief, I lost Little Miss America.
What? What do you mean you've lost her?
It wasn't my fault. We went to her address, and she'd gone.
I tell you, we even hired detectives.
- That kid has vanished from the face of the Earth.
- That's what you're going to do.
- Do you realize what you've done to me?
- No, wait a minute.
- I'll never explain this to Bartlett.
- You won't have to.
- I told him already.
- You what?
- What did he say?
- Well, for a minute he didn't say anything.
Then I couldn't understand him.
Why, you-
Hello, Operator.
I want New York.
I want to speak to Mr. Cyrus Bartlett,
Ryan Lender 51680.
Informs me...
Yes?
- Mr. Kent on long distance.
- Hello?
- Hello. Mr. Bartlett?
- Yeah!
This is Kent. Tony Kent.
Look here, Kent, you sold me on the idea of-
##I'd want an old straw hat a sui9t of overalls ##
Just a minute, Mr. Bartlett.
You're going a little too far.
We can straighten out everything.
Why, you-You've ruined-
You've scuttled my product!
The failure of this program... will be an insurmountable affront to the dignity of Crackly Grain Flakes!
And, Kent, I'll get you for this!
I'll... I'll... I'll...
# This is the wish I would choose #
# I'd want an old straw hat a suit of overalls #
# And a worn-out pair of shoes #
# Just let me roam around #
# Laughing at big-city blues #
# With an old straw hat a suit of overalls #
# And a worn-out pair of shoes #
# Howdy, Mr. Brown
Ho-hum #
- Chief! Chief! It's a mirage!
- Shut up.
It's the kid! Little Miss America!
You got to listen.
# How about a hayride
Saturday night #
But, Mr. Bartlett,
I've been trying to tell you...
I've got Little Miss America!
Wait. Listen.
- Listen!
- ## Get an old straw hat ##
# A suit of overalls and a worn-out pair of shoes #
Hold it.
And don't hang up!
Hello?
Homer! Aloysius!
Give me a hand!
Oh!
Get over here.
Keep playing. Loud.
Let's go.
Come on, Rebecca!
Come on. Come on, honey.
Sing another chorus right here under the phone. Play it, will ya?
Give it everything you got, honey.
# If I had one wish to make #
# This is the wish I would choose #
# I'd want an old straw hat a suit of overalls #
# And a worn-out pair of shoes #
# Just let me roam around #
# Laughing at big-city blues #

# Howdy, Mr. Brown
Ho-hum #
# Going fishing? Hope you get a bite
Yes, indeed, I do #
# Howdy, Mr. Jones
Ho-hum #
# How's about a hayride #
# On Saturday night
Ho-ho-ho #
# Sing hi-ho, the merry-o #
# What have you got
What have you got to lose #
# Get an old straw hat a suit of overalls #
# And a worn-out hat #
# Overalls #
# Shoes #
Did you hear that, Mr. Bartlett?
Of course she's right here.
That's what I called to tell you.
Oh, that. Uh, uh-
My assistant was just playing a practical joke.
Oh, you're right. It wasn't very funny.
He's never very funny.
Yes, Mr. Bartlett.
Everything's fine.
In fact, everything's beautiful.
Good-bye, Mr. Bartlett.
Whew.
Well, I put it over, chief.
I knew I'd find her.
I still can't believe it.
Why, it's marvelous.
- But what, Mr. Kent?
- It's uncanny!
We had a kid all set for a big program.
She disappeared, and now it turns out to be Rebecca.
Why, it sounds like a fairy tale.
- It is!
- I love fairy tales.
My old pal, Rebecca!
I was crazy about you before, but now- Ohh!
Why didn’t you tell me you tried out for my program?
But I didn’t know it was your program.
- Am I going on the radio after all?
- You bet you are!
Why, you'll be a sensation.
Oh, I don't think
Aunt Miranda will like it.
Don't you worry about Aunt Miranda.
I'll sell her a bill of goods.
Going to have to be a mighty good salesman, Mr. Kent.
Rebecca tells me Aunt Miranda is rather old-fashioned.
- She's mighty peculiar.
- I'm glad I brought you, Homer.
Having along an old friend of Aunt Miranda's... ought to get me off on the right foot.
I'm warn you again... It won't none to have me along.
I've known Miranda for 25 years, and
I can't rightly say understand her yet.
- Maybe I'd better wait out here.
- Wait a minute.
That's no way to talk to the chief.
Where's your loyalty?
We got to pull together.
Orville, I think you'd better pull from out here, where you can't do any damage.
Oh, now, chief-
Hello.
Have you told
Aunt Miranda anything yet?
No. Gwen thought it would be better to surprise her.
- Aunt Miranda isn't in a very good humor today.
- Oh-oh.
Where are you going, Homer?
It just came to me sort of sudden-like.
Maybe I'd be in the way, hmm?
I'm depending on you.
Aunt Miranda, this is Mr. Kent.
How do you do, Miss Wilkins?
How are you?
What's that man doing in my house?
- Why, l... l...That is, l...
- Now, Miranda...
Rebecca, tell that man to get out of my house.
I think Aunt Miranda wants you to leave, Mr. Busby.
All right.
I guess I can take a hint.
But you can tell her for me it isn’t Christian to hold a grudge so long.
- Mr. Busby says it isn't
Christian to hold a-
- I heard him.
You did?
Mr. Kent, I don't thank you for bringing that no-good-
Auntie, I don't think
Mr. Kent understands.
I assure you, I had no idea there'd been a breach between you and Mr. Busby.
Breach? I don't even know that Mr. Busby's on Earth.
I quite understand,
Miss Wilkins.
I can see now there couldn't possibly be any community of interest... between a lady of your background and a man like Homer.
Hmm. Won't you sit down, young man?
Thank you, Miss Wilkins.
I knew you'd like Tony, Aunt Miranda.
Tony?
Yes. That's short for Anthony.
I have a great surprise for you,
Miss Wilkins.
I've been connected with radio a long time... but never have I met a more talented child than Rebecca.
Fortunately, she's just what we need for a big program we're starting.
- Why, Rebecca's personality and voice are two of the most...
- Just a minute, young man!
Are you trying to tell me you want to put Rebecca on the radio?
Why, yes, on a very important program.
A nationwide hookup-
- Get out of here!
- B... B... But, Miss Wilkins,
I don't understand. l...
Auntie, please listen to Mr. Kent.
I want to go on the radio so bad.
- You keep out this
- This is a very important opportunity for Rebecca.
- Surely you can't say no.
- Oh, can't I?
Well, just listen to this, Mr. Kent... No!
I know what you theatrical people are- a no-good lot:
I took Rebecca out of that unwholesome atmosphere... and I'm not going to put her back into it.
She's going to stay right here where I can keep an eye on her.
- But, Miss Wilkins, I...
_ Mr. Kent, I'm asking you to leave.
- If that's the way you feel, there's nothing more to say.
- Indeed, there isn't.
All right, Miss Wilkins, but you're making a serious mistake.
I don't want to hear this subject mentioned again.
And, Rebecca, if you go near that man again...
I'll take you over my knee and give you a spanking you'll never forget.
That goes for both of you.
How much you have to pay her, chief?
Pay her?
Why, we didn't even get her.
Tony! Waite minute!
The charming Miss Wilkins practically tore my head off.
- She was awfully mean to you, Tony.
- It looks hopeless.
Once Aunt Miranda makes up her mind, she's too stubborn to change it.
I've been trying to change it for 25 years.
I'm afraid this is good-bye.
I've got to get back to New York and straighten out this mess.
We're sorry you're going.
I'm none too happy over it myself, but I'll be back.
Good-bye, Tony.
I wish I could sing you over the telephone, like I did to Mr. Bartlett.
- Tony, why not?
- What do you mean?
Broadcast from here.
It's possible, isn't it?
Why, yes, it could be done by remote control.
Sure, chief!. We could run wires down like we did on the courthouse.
Then the kid could stay in the program.
Oh, please try it. With all her talent,
Rebecca deserves a chance.
Oh, Tony, please do!
It's insane, but I don't see why it won't work.
Uh-oh. What about Aunt Miranda?
Well, we won't tell her. And you can
Depend on us to keep her in the dark.
You bet we will.
We're very "inescapable."
I don't know.
Miranda's a mighty peculiar woman.

Crackly Grain Flake...
- Never mind the commercial.
Boys, that was a swell rehearsal.
Knock off and get your feed.
We go on the air in a couple of hours.
Come and get it!
You'd better relax too.
It won't be long now, Rebecca. Nervous?
Of course not. I never get nervous.
I'm very self-reliant.
I don't mind saying
I'm shaking like a leaf.
Well, well!
If it isn't Farmer Gray.
How are all the crops?
- Nice of you to show up for the broadcast anyway.
- Darling, don't be that way.
I suppose I should cheer when you miss a rehearsal.
- Now you know how I feel when you keep me waiting!
- Uh, Miss Warren, Miss Lee.
Miss Lee is an old friend.
- How do you do, Miss Lee?
- Hello, Miss Warren.
I've always wanted to meet a farmer's daughter.
Ig led known you were coming,
I'd have worn my sun bonnet.
And this is Rebecca, the star of our program.
Oh, isn't she cute.
How old are you, little one?
I'm eight. How old are you?
That's a question you must never ask a lady.
Oh. I guess you must be pretty old.
Sweet little thing, isn't she?
We'd better be going
Before Aunt Miranda gets suspicious.
That's right. We don't want anything like that to happen.
Don't worry about a thing.
Homer and I know exactly what to do.
That was a sweet greeting. You practically broke my arm when I tried to kiss you.
- Couldn't you have at least waited until they'd gone?
- Oh, so that's it.
A barnyd romance. No wonder you wanted to broadcast from this outpost.
That blonde hayseed's got you doing nip-ups.
- Don't start anything, Lola.
That kid means a lot to me.
- Yeah?
Which kid are you talking about?
- Chief, I couldn't find Lola anywhere.
- Keep looking, Orville.
- You'll find her.
- Not if I can help it.
Oh! Lola!
I'm sure glad to see you.
- Thanks, my pet.
- Lola.
- There's something I've been wanting to tell you.
- Shoot.
Maybe I better tell you some other time.
Aw, come on, Orville.
Let's have it.
Well, I don't know whether I should... because this is sort of a secret.
I won't tell a soul.
Well, uh, there’s a certain party... that's crazy about you.
- Yes?
- Yes.
And because of certain circumstances... this party is afraid to tell you just how he feels.
Oh, how ridiculous.
Why, when a man loves a girl, he should take her in his arms, smother her with kisses... and tell her he adores her.
All right then. I will.
Lola, I adore you.
Oh!
- Were you talking about yourself?
- Sure, Lola.
- Couldn't you go for a guy like me?
- Yeah, with an ax.
With an-
I was afraid of that.
- I guess the only one you can see is Tony.
- That's right.
We'll be seeing it with orange blossoms any day now.
- Well, congratulations.
- Aw, Cheer, Orville.
Let's run over the number. Pete, will you give us "Alone With You," please?
# I've always known that three's a crowd #
# Only two may dance #

Rebecca should be here now.
She goes on in five minutes.
- She'll be here, all right.
- I hope so.
- What if she can't make it?
- I've got a two-minute emergency ready.
- After that, we're sunk.
- Oh.
- You didn't, by any chance, have anything to do with this?
- I didn't do a thing.
So the doctor said to me,
"Mrs. Turner, in my 20 years of practice...
I've never seen a case like yours before."
So he called right away, and they rushed me to the hospital.
What's gotten into you, Rebecca? You've been yawning and fidgeting ever since dinner.
I'm so sleepy... and this horsehair tickles.
Where are your manners, child?
I don't know what ails her, Mrs. Turner.
- Don't you think Rebecca ought to go to bed?
- Might as well.
Better than falling asleep here in our laps.
Good night!
Rebecca!
Come right back here!
Didn't you forget something, Rebecca?
Oh, yes. I'm sorry.
Good night, Reverend Turner.
Good night, Mrs. Turner.
Land's sakes. I never did see a child so eager to go to bed.
I think I'll go up and help her.
Since when couldn't Rebecca undress herself?
- But the poor little thing's so sleepy.
- Well!
Gwen, there's something wrong with my whistler.
If mine's out of order, we're sunk.
- That's the signal.
- Let's go.
- You Hold it steady, Al.
I'll go up and get her.
- If I don't hold it, skip it.
We're late.
What kept you?
- Mrs. Turner's operation.
- Is the ladder safe?
- I built it myself.
- Just the same, you better hold it up from here.
Shh.
You better get her on it.
Come on, honey. We've got to hurry.
Program is half over now.
- Gwen!
- Hang on.
- Yes, Auntie?
- What's going on up there?
Oh, it's nothing.
I just knocked over a rocking chair.
Well, you're old enough to know better.
Yes, Auntie.
Shh.
That was a close call.
You better stay up here until they bring Rebecca back.
This way, dear.
The doctor told me he operated just in time.
- Have another piece of kake.
- I've already had two.
- You've had three, but you're welcome.
- Oh, that reminds me.
Henry, what time is it?
Surely you're not thinking of leaving, Mts. Turner?
Oh, no, but I did want to hear that new
Crackly Grain Flakes Hour on the radio.
8:10, dear.
Oh, my. It's started already.
- Uh, may I?
- Well, no. It's not working, I don't think.
There was nothing wrong with it this morning, I'm sorry to say.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, the high spot of our program.
Crackly Grain Flakes takes pleasure in presenting everybody's little girl... healthy, happy
Little Miss America.
Her first song will be
"Come and Get Your Happiness."

Land's sakes, that’s peculiar!
If I didn't know Rebecca was upstairs in bed...
I'd swear that was her voice on the radio.
Well, it did sound like Rebecca, but of course it couldn't possibly be.
Maybe not, but she's gotten mighty heavy all of a sudden.
Now, Auntie...
Rebecca? Are you asleep?
Yes, Auntie.
- Homer Busby, get off that bed!
- Miranda.
- You're talking to me.
- Course I'm talking to you.
- Take me to Rebecca.
- I've waited we years for this moment.
- Fiddlesticks.
- Oh, don't be stubborn any longer.
We're wasting the best gears of our livers.
Homer Busby, you're revolting.
Come on, Mirandy. Give in.
How do I know I can trust you after the way you acted?
I swear I'll never keep you waiting again.
Give me one more chance.
Are you sure you got all the wild oats out of your system?
Congratulations, you two.
There's no time for this folderol.
Where is she?
Take me to her!
Come on!
And now, before we sign off, our little star has another number for you.
What would you like to sing for us?
What would you like me to sing, Mr. Smithers?
I'm sure everyone would like to hear you sing the songs...
- that have made a lot of people happy.
- All right.
# My dear radio audience #
# Now I shall do #
# Some of the songs I've had the pleasure of introduction to you #
# It was not so very long ago #
# When you heard this little ditty #
# On your radio, oh #
# On the good ship
Lollipop #
# It's a sweet trip to a candy shop #
# Where bonbons play #
# On the sunny beach of Peppermint Bay #
# And do you remember #
# Animal crackers in my soup #
# Monkeys and rabbits loop the loop #
# Gosh, oh, gee but I have fun #
# Swallowing animals one by one #
# And I never ever will forget my grandest thrill #
# The very first time that I sang #
# An ordinary day becomes a holiday #
# When I'm with you #
# Mmm, mmm #
# I have lots of toys but I don't want to play #
# Yes, and I'll never forget it #
# I sat in my daddy's lap and whispered #
# Oh, Daddy, how I miss you #
# You're busy all your life #
# I long to hug and kiss you #
# Marry me and let me be your wife #
#Ah, but it’s great to reminisce #
# When I sang to my little Dutch dolly #
#J ust like this #
# Sometimes I ought to haste you #
# You make me feel so blue #
# But honest I can't haste you #
# When you smile at me main lovely popgun #
# Ach, main goodness #
The clock is ticking the hours away.
# And so, my radio audience #
# The time has come #
# For me to say #
# Good night, my friends #
# The tired old moon is descending #
# Good night, my friends #
# My moment with you now is ending #
And so I must leave you with kindest regards... from Rebecca and Crackly Grain Flakes... the grain flake that makes your tummy...
Say yum, yum, yummy.
I want all my little friends to close their eyes and dream... for in the morning, it's Crackly Grain Flakes... some sugar and cream.
Eat it with a smile, and life will be worthwhile.
Now, in conclusion... please join me in singing my theme.
# Good night, my friends #
# Sleep tight, my friends #
# God bless you
Pleasant dreams #
Nighty-night.
- That was Rebecca.
- Go on. You're daffy.
Oh, am I? I know that kid when I hear.
I've heard her a thousand times.
What would she be doing on a big hookup like that?
I told you when you married me you'd be in the dough, didn’t I?
Come on. Get dressed.
Adorable!
Come on, folks. Hurry up.
Miss Winstead,
I think you're wonderful.
- You mean, the program was all right?
- Who cares about the program?
- Miss Winstead, I love you.
- And I love you too, Tony.
I don't know how
I ever got along before I met you.
Tony, when I grow up, would you marry me
Rebecca, I've never received a more flattering proposal, but it won't work out.
By the time you're ready to get married,
I'll have a long, gray beard.
Then would you marry Gwen?
She's almost ready.
Rebecca, will you give me a kiss?
They just can't resist you, can they, Tony?
How 'bout running down to the village with me?
I can't. I've got to wrap up Little
Miss America and put her back where I found her.
So far, everything's gone like clockwork.
- I'm afraid the clock's going to stop, Tony.
- Huh?
Now, Miss Wilkins, I don't want you to say anything until you hear my side of this.
Young man, what are you going to pay Rebecca?
Well- Huh?
But, Aunt Miranda, I don't want any pay.
I love to sing.
Then you don't mind, Miss Wilkins?
Course I mind. I'm not going to have my niece a big radio star and not get paid for it.
You won't have a thing to worry about,
Miss Wilkins. I assure you.
- You're an old dear.
- You're a honey, Aunt Miranda.
- Hmm.
- How about me?
Homer Busby, you're an old fool.
But you can't wait much longer, Aunt Miranda.
She's right, Mirandy.
I got my rig out here if you want to take a ride in the moonlight.
Go on, Auntie. I'll be along later.
Homer Busby, you always were impulsive.
Come on, Rebecca.
But, Miranda, I thought that after all these years...
Nonsense! It's past Rebecca's bedtime and mine too.
Come along. Good might!
Tony, darling, if Miss What’s Here Name doesn't mind, I'd like to speak with you.
- Will you pardon me, Gwen?
- Oh, don't bother about me.
I'll be right back.
- Oh, hello!
- Hello.
- Gee, it was a swell program, wasn't it?
- Yes, it was.
- Wasn't she wonderful?
- Rebecca’s all right.
- Uh, yes, she is, but I meant Lola.
- Oh.
- Oh, gosh, she's sweet.
- So it's like that, is it?
Well, only on my side.
She's crazy about the chief.
Oh, really?
Gee, he's a lucky guy.
He gets everything guy.
- Yes, I... I suppose he does.
Good night, Orville.
- Good night.
Where's Gwen?
Oh, think she started for home.
Gwen.
- Pardon me, but haven't you forgotten something?
- I don't think so.
Well, think again. A fella named Kent is going to take you home.
- You think again.
- What's wrong?
- Oh, nothing, nothing at all.
- Gwen, what is all this about?
- Please, it isn't anything.
- Tony, darling:
Is it Lola that's worrying you?
Lola? Mm-mmm. Let's forget it.
Good night.
Now I'm going to make a gingerbread man.
Now I think I'll make a moon.
Now I thing a heart.
Now a star.
Gwen, when these are done, let's take some over to Tony.
Well, I'll be too busy, but you can take some over to him.
- Don't you like Tony anymore?
- Well, of course I like him.
You sounded like you're mad at him.
Now, Melba, act nice to the kid.
You don't have to tell me how to act.
So, all right, honey.
I got it twice.
- We could sue them for that.
- That's an idea.
Oh, run along, will you, and see who's at the door?
Hello there, honey.
How's tricks? Meet the missus-
- Your new mother.
- How do you do?
Hello, kid. How about a kiss?
- No, Thank you.
- Fresh, eh?
- Aunt Miranda!
- Aunt Miranda!
- What a dump!
Isn’t it a laugh? Wait till you see Aunt Miranda. She'll kill you.
- I hope not.
- Hey, come on in. Get a load of this.
- What do you think of it?
- I wouldn't like it if I was a moth.
Well, well!
A long time no see, folks.
Meet the new missus.
And this is my attorney Singer.
- Pleased to meet you.
- I thought you weren't coming back here, Harry Kipper.
It's this way, Miranda. I been doing all right, just got married and all.
And I'm ready to take Rebecca back now.
You do no such thing! You gave the child up once, and you can't take her back now.
Now, now, now, now, Miranda, there's no reason we can't be friendly about this.
I'd as soon be friendly with a rattlesnake.
It's obvious you've heard Rebecca on the radio and you're after her money.
It's Harry's kid, isn’t it? We got more right to her dough than you have.
Don't let them take me away,
Aunt Miranda. I didn't like it with him.
Now, honey, you'll have a swell time with me.
You can have anything you want.
Then I want to stay here!
Oh, Mr. Kipper, you can't take Rebecca away.
She's been happier here than she's ever been in her whole life.
- Now you get out of my house!
- Not without the kid, we don't.
I don't want to get tough about this,
Miranda, but you're asking for it.
You just try and take her.
Now, my dear madam, all this yelling isn't going to get us anyplace.
And don't forget that Mr. Kipper is the child's stepfather and legal guardian.
The courts of New York have decreed that he shall have custody of the child.
Here are the papers.
Now, madam, if you'll take the advice of a lawyer... who's looking out for your interest... as well as my own client's, you'll see that this child parks her things and gets out of here.
He's right, Auntie.
There's nothing we can do about it now. et y pac, kid. Go on.
I'll help.
I warn you, Harry Kipper.
You better take good care of the child.
Say, didn't I always treat her right?
Don't worry. I'll handle the kid like she was my own.
Sure!
Maybe if I work hard, Uncle Harry will let me come back for the visit.
Of course, darling.
Maybe you and Aunt Miranda can come to the city and see me too.
You bet we will.
I guess I won't need these in the city.
Will you save them for me, for when I come back?
Don't cry, Gwen.
You said you'd come and see me.
I brought you some cookies to eat on the way.
Thank you, Aunt Miranda.
I'm going to miss your cookies.
And here's a picture of me, so you won't forget what I look like.
Of course, it isn't a very good likeness.
It was taken 20 years ago.
- I'll never forget you, Aunt Miranda.
- Oh, of course you will.
Please, Aunt Miranda,
I don't want to leave.
Go on, now. Go on.
We haven't got all day.
Here, honey.
They're taking enough time. That kid must have more clothes than I've got.
- All set, kid?
- Yes.
- Come on.
- Good-bye, Gwen. Good-bye, Aunt Miranda.
So long, folks.
See you in church.
Bye, Aloysius.
I'm going away.
- I sure hate to see you go, Miss Rebecca.
- Oh, I'll be back.
Sure, you will, honey.
And don't forget this.
I won't.
Take good care of yourself, Rebecca.
I will, Aunt Miranda.
I'm very self-reliant.
Good-bye, darling.
Come on.
- Good morning, Gwen.
- Hello. Is Mr. Kent home?
He'll be right out.
- Well, good morning.
- I hate to be a bother, but I had to see you.
I was hoping I'd see you before I went back to New York.
- Gwen, what was wrong last night?
- Oh, I was rude, and I'm sorry.
But that isn't what
I came over here for.
Something terrible happened, and you've got to help me. Rebecca's gone.
Gone? But how?
What happened?
Her stepfather came back with a court order.
But he can't take her.
I'm going to put her under contract.
It's too late.
They've already gone to New York!
- Come on and pack. We got to get Rebecca.
- All right.
Baby Bath invites you to the premiere of a new series of programs... starring that cheerful little earful,
Little Miss Universe.
Remember, if you want your child to have a perfect skin... use Baby Bath, The velvet soap.
To start things off, smiling Frankie Lee and his Baby Bathers... bring you that new song sensation,
"Wash Your Troubles Away."
- Here we are, Mr. Purvis.
- Well, we're on our way, Kipper.
You're a lucky man, Mr. Purvis.
If you handle the kid right, she'll make you a fortune.
You're lucky yourself with this contract.
We'd feel a lot luckier if you'd give us a little advance.
If Rebecca clicks tonight as she did at rehearsal, you'll get a big, fat check tomorrow.
I still can't understand why you sold her to me instead of to Kent.
Well, first come, first serve, Mr. Purvis.
I've been waiting for a long time to put something over on Tony Kent.
Will he burn when he hears that his Little
Miss America is now my Little Miss Universe.
Oh, dear.
Oh, dear me.
- Anything wrong, mister?
- I'm almost a nervous breakdown.
I get this way before every program.
Oh, are you going on the radio now?
Well, that's just what makes me so nervous. I never know.
Then why don't you ask somebody?
Well, they don't know either.
This is certainly a funny radio station.
Why, my dear young lady, there's nothing funny about in. lim an organist, one of the best, if I may say so.
- Hamilton Montmarcy.
Perhaps you've heard of me?
- I don't think so.
Well, there you are. Nobody has.
You see, I'm an emergency musician.
But there's never any emergencies around here.
You mean, people get sick and can't go on the radio?
Well, that was the idea when they hated me, but nobody ever gets sick around here.
I've waited 10 months, and there hasn't been so much as a bad cold.
Don't worry, Mr. Montmarcy.
Somebody’ll be sick any day now!
I certainly hope sp.
Oh, dear.
Oh, dear, dear, dear.
- Gwen! Tony!
- Hello, honey.
Darling! Oh!
- Well!
- Purvis, you put over a fast one, didn't you?
- All's fair, you know, kent.
- I'll give goy &100,000 for Rebecca's contract.
- Ha! Not a chance.
But, Mr. Purvis, this isn't just a business matter.
It is to me... big business
Little Miss Universe goes on the air in a minute.
There's a couple of seats in the auditorium, if you care to listen.
A hundred thousand bucks, and you had to sell her to Purvis.
- Well, that's that.
- Can't I go back with you and Tony?
I'm afraid not, darling.
- At least not for a little while.
- But I don't wanna stay here.
I know, but you can't always have everything you want right when you want it.
But we'll get you back with us someday.
I guess I won't be able tp sing for you now, Tony.
Mmm. Don't you worry about that, honey.
Singing for me isn't important anymore.
It's just that we want you with us.
It may take time, so you've got to be a brave little girl.
- I will, Tony.
- We'll be listening to you, so do your best.
- Come on, Gwen.
- Good-bye, darling.
All right.
Here's your cue.
And here comes your cheerful little earful,
Little Miss Universe... bringing you that charming melody, "Old Straw Hat".
# If I had one wish to make #
#This is the wish...#
Let's try it again.
Please.
# If I had one wi...#
Want to try it again?
- What’s the matter with your voice/
- I can't talk.
- What is the matter?
- Go on and sigh. Go on.
You're getting paid for it.
- Do you want a glswof water?
- I can't talk.
- Go on. Do something.
- What is the matter?
- Sing in there.
- I can't talk.
- Poor baby.
- I'll get a doctor.
Hey. Montmarcy, you're on!
Studio "B".
- I'm on? Oh.
- Yeah.
Oh. Oh. Oh, I'm on.
Oh, dear. I'm on.
Oh. I'll be back in a minute.
I'm on.
Wonderful.
Isn't it marvelous?
How wonderful.
You will now hear an organ recital by Hamilton Montmarcy.
Oh. Okay.
Because of conditions beyond our control... our program will continue with selected recordings.
- I knew something would go wrong.
- Shut up!
- I can't...
- You shut up too!
If you don't want the licking of your life, tell me the truth.
- Did Kent put you up to this?
- No. I can't talk.
Kipper, you knew this when you sold me the kid!
I'll stake my professional integrity that this is a frame-up.
- Dr. Hill is here.
- Ah! Now we'll know whether it's a frame-up or not.
- Where's the patient?
- This little girl here.
Well, you look healthy enough to me.
What's wrong with you?
I can't talk.
She claims something happened to her voice.
And, Doc, if the little brat's stalling,
I'll slather silly.
Mmm, we'll see. Is there someplace where I can examine her?
You can examine her right in here, Doctor.
Thank you. Come on.
I'm sorry.
If this little girl is really sick, you'll need a doctor too.
- Where's Rebecca?
- She's in there with the doctor.
- Oh, darling.
- What's wrong, honey?
I can't t...
- Well, Doc?
- Oh, there's no question about it.
It's partly a psychogenic condition, and partly the result of straining the child's voice.
Doc, you mean the kid can't work?
Oh, she won't be able to sing or even to talk very clearly.
But with a complete rest for a year or two, she may get over it.
Well, Kipper, there's your contract.
Don't you worry, honey.
It's kind of fun to whisper anyway.
Come in here, you two.
Look, Kipper.
I think Rebecca should be with her aunt.
After all, she's not much use to you now.
I'll give you $5,000 if you turn over your legal guardianship to Aunt Miranda.
Well, now, um, the kid means a lot to me.
- Don't be a sucker! Take it.
- Okay.
Drop up to my office in the morning.
- You can get the money as soon as you sign the papers.
- How about a little advance?
Here's a hundred dollars to clinch the deal.
Well, so long, kid.
See you in church.
Thank you, Tony.
I imagine these are the good friends you told me about.
Doctor, isn't there anything we can do for Rebecca?
That depends on the circumstances.
Sometimes these things clear up rather suddenly.
Good-bye.
Good night, Rebecca.
Good-bye, Doctor. And thanks!
I hope I can do the same for you some day.
Rebecca!
What a smarty you turned out tube.
I always told you
I was very self-reliant.

- Do I have to eat any more of this?
- DefiniteIy.
Spinach is very rich in vitamins.
I might say disgustingIy rich.
And very good for you, Miss Barbara.
Why is it so many things you don't Iike are good for you?
I couIdn't say offhand, Miss Barbara, but you must eat some more of your spinach.
Why do I have to?
Your Iunch caIIs for so many vitamins, and you must have them.
AII right.
My goodness, that was an awfuI big vitamin.
- Have you finished, Miss Barbara?
- But definiteIy.
The third sneeze.
Let me see your tongue.
I'm afraid you'II have to go to bed.
I'm not sick. I feeI fine.
CoIIins, she's perfectIy weII.
A sneeze is nothing to be aIarmed at.
Perhaps not, but I'm responsibIe for the chiId.
Come, my dear.
Phone for Dr PaImer.
The chiId sneezes and you'd think the worId was coming to an end.
Can't they Ieave her aIone?
She's a perfectIy normaI, heaIthy chiId.
The way they carry on, you'd think she was made of gIass.
Something ought to be done with CoIIins.
- How Mr Barry can...
- Sshh!
..stand that femaIe is beyond me.
WeII, you can't expect a widower and a man as busy as Mr Barry is to notice everything that's going on in the house.
Better do your teIephoning.
No, itjust seems to be a sIight coId, but Mr Barry aIways wants us to notify him.
Just got a message from Barry's home.
His chiId is iII.
Just got a message from Barry's home. His chiId is iII.
OK, I'II see that he gets the message.
Mr Barry is wanted at home at once.
His child is quite ill.
ReaIIy?
- Where's Mr Barry?
- At the househoId exhibit.
- His daughter's seriousIy iII.
- I'II go over to the show and pick him up.
If he phones, teII him I'm on my way over.
Thank you. Be ready for the opening of the exhibit at 2.15.
(women) Yes, Mr Barry.
- May I heIp?
- Thank you.
Seems I can't do anything without Barry making troubIe for me.
I hate that man.
He causes me more sIeepIess nights...
SIeepIess nights? What does he do, pIay a sIide trombone under your window?
Everything but that. I Iay awake haIf the night thinking up new ideas.
Then I find Barry's not onIy beaten me to them, he's topped me in a thousand ways.
I wish he'd drown in his own soap suds.
- I shouIdn't be boring you with my troubIes.
- That's aII right.
- Are you in this business?
- Yes.
I'm with the Peck Company. Advertising.
I see. I'm sorry you disIike this feIIow Barry, though. He's reaIIy not a bad sort.
- Do you know him?
- SIightIy. My barber cuts his hair.
- Maybe I couId bribe him to cut his throat.
- Mr Barry, do you think she'II be aII right?
I don't know. Let me see.
- Yes, she'II do very niceIy.
- Thank you, Mr Barry. Just what I thought.
Of aII the rotten tricks! Letting me taIk my head off without teIIing me.
Just another exampIe of Barry cIeverness, I suppose.
What was she burning about?
I keep her awake nights.
Mr Barry, you're wanted at home right away.
Barbara's very iII.

Ah.
- WiII you read to me from this?
- AII right. Which one is it to be?
It's the one where Betsy runs away from the orphan asyIum and meets Tony, the organ grinder, and his monkey.
''Betsy Ware was two years oId when her mother died.''
''Because the famiIy was poor,
Betsy couIdn't stay at home.''
''So she was sent to an orphan asyIum.''
Which was an ugIy red-brick buiIding far, far away from where Betsy used to Iive.
Yes. ''From where Betsy used to Iive.''
''A young man came dancing round the corner in a green coat and bumped right into her.''
'''Excuse me,' said the young man.
'I'm aIways bumping into peopIe.'''
''That's why they caII me Puddin' Head...''
''So Mary couIdn't pIay that afternoon.
She had Iessons to do...''
No, no. Read what happened after Betsy met Puddin' Head.
Oh, excuse me.
Why, I must have skipped a page.
- How is she?
- She's fine.
The doctor was here and he said there isn't the sIightest thing the matter with her.
Now, you see, Mr Barry?
She's perfectIy aII right.
CoIIins gets panicky every time the chiId sneezes.
CoIIins is right. I want every precaution taken.
Of course, I know it's none of my business, Mr Barry, but did you ever stop to consider that the constant piIIing up of precautions and attentions was bad for the chiId?
Why, she's pampered and watched over and babied to death.
- WouId you mind if I'd offer a suggestion?
- No, go ahead.
If I were you, I'd send Barbara to schooI where she'II be with other chiIdren.
There may be something in that.
Perhaps schooI's the thing.
TeII CoIIins I wish to speak to her about it.
I know what CoIIins wiII say.
CoIIins aIways says no.
- HeIIo, Daddy.
- HeIIo, sweet.
Daddy, why do I aIways have to pIay aIone?
Why can't I pIay with other chiIdren?
- Honey, how wouId you Iike to go to schooI?
- Goody-goody!
- WeII, I guess that's settIed, then.
- Yes, Mr Barry?
I'm sending Barbara to schooI in the
Adirondacks, where her mother used to go.
But the chiId's much too young for a summer camp.
Didn't I teII you CoIIins aIways said no?
I've onIy been foIIowing your instructions.
I'm sorry if...
She needs to be with other chiIdren.
Get in touch with the Forest Grove SchooI right away.
Take care of aII the detaiIs.
- Yes, sir.
- (man) Mr Barry.
You wanted to Iisten to the changes on your radio hour.
- The programme's on now.
- Oh, yes.
? B-a-r-r-y
? Why don't you buy a bar of Barry's?
? Every grocer carries Barry's
? You will find that Barry's little bubbles
? Make you kinda laugh at your washing troubles
? Buy a bar of Barry's
? It's the berries, that's Barry's
? So run, don't waIk
? To the nearest exit and find a bar of Barry's
And now the Barry baritone will sing that new hit tune, ''When l'm With You''.
? Every street I waIk on becomes a Iovers Iane
? When I'm with you
? I can see the sun though we're out in the rain
? When I'm with you
? To lose you would be tragic
? Here is my heart unfurled
? You have that certain magic
? You're the Seven Wonders of the World
? Snow is on the ground but the Ieaves are on the trees
? When I'm with you
? Flowers sing a love song, there's music in the breeze
? When l'm with you
? Ooh
? Please let me make this confession
? You are my magnifiicent obsession
? The world is all in rhyme, lovely one
? When l'm with you
You know, Daddy, this house wouIdn't be so
Ionesome if you'd stay home once in a whiIe.
If I stayed home aII the time, there wouIdn't be any house.
Do you know, Daddy, I can sing that song, and I've got my own words.
- Wanna hear them?
- Mm-hm.
? An ordinary day becomes a hoIiday
? When I'm with you
? I have Iots of toys but I don't wanna pIay
? When I'm with you
? Oh, Daddy, how I miss you
? You're busy aII your Iife
? I Iove to hug and kiss you
? Marry me and Iet me be your wife
? Every word I hear sounds Iike a IuIIaby
? When I'm with you
? Even funny spinach tastes Iike pumpkin pie
? When I'm with you
? Ooh
? In every dream I caress you
? And every night
I pray the Lord wiII bIess you
? The worId's a nursery rhyme, Daddy dear
? When I'm with you
Are you going to stay in schooI with me?
No, my dear.
I'm going to take a IittIe vacation.
- What's a vacation?
- It's a rest, dear.
Getting away from peopIe you've been with and seeing new faces.
You reaIIy become another person on a vacation.
- What person are you gonna be?
- Just another person.
- Is going to schooI a vacation?
- HardIy. Just the opposite.
You think CoIIins is strict, but wait tiII you get to schooI.
There'II be no running to Woodward or to your daddy.
You'II do just what you're toId.
I don't think I'm gonna Iike schooI.
- May I take Snoopy with me?
- No, my dear.
- You're not aIIowed to have dogs in schooI.
- No?
- No, indeed.
- That settIes it.
- AII right, darIing. We'd better get started.
- Come, my dear.
Goodbye, Snoopy.
Are they expecting you this evening?
I toId them we'd be out sometime this week.
You'd better wire them and have a car meet you.
- I'II do it from the station.
- You're going to be very happy at schooI.
- Maybe.
- Maybe?
Sure you're going to be happy.
I'II be up and spend every weekend with you.
- Goodbye, sweetheart.
- Aren't you coming into the station with us?
I'm sorry. I can't. I'm Iate for a business appointment aIready.
I'm aIways running away from you.
I'II make up for it Saturday and Sunday.
I'II spend every minute with you.
We'II have Iots of fun. Goodbye.
- Take good care of her, CoIIins.
- Yes, sir.
- What's this for?
- It weighs you for a penny.
- I wanna be weighed.
- WeII, I haven't a penny.
- I have a penny.
- AII right.
No, here.
On this side is your weight. 58 pounds.
And on this side is your fortune.
What does it say? What does it say?
It says you're going away on a Iong trip.
You're going to meet a Iot of strange peopIe.
What a smart machine.
Come, my dear.
Porter, I have to send a teIegram.
My purse. It's gone.
I must have dropped it.
Keep an eye on her. I'II be back in a minute.
Yes, ma'am.
- (screeching tyres)
- Look out, Iady!
Come on! Give her air!
- What's your name?
- Rufus Washington Jackson Lee.
- AII by yourseIf?
- (chuckles)
- My name is Betsy Ware.
- That's a mighty pretty name.
- Did you ever have a vacation?
- Oh, yes, missy. Lots and Iots of 'em.
- Are they fun?
- They are if you don't have too many.
I'II bet they're more fun than going to schooI.
I never had a vacation, but I'm thinking about having one.
Look.
- Why don't you heIp your brother?
- Brother?
AII right, IittIe missy.
You just wait right here tiII I come back.
There was a Iady and IittIe girI with these.
They went away and didn't come back.
AII right.
- Has the woman been identified?
- No. No pocketbook, no Iaundry marks.
You'd better caII up the bureau of missing persons and have a description sent out.
It's Tony!
And his monkey!
Gee, that's a sweII hat.
I wish I couId have one Iike it.
- Here, take it.
- Oh, thanks.
- And you may have these, too.
- Thanks a Iot.
I know who you are. You're Tony.
That's right. Antonio is my middIe name.
I'm on my vacation.
Do you wanna come aIong?
You're very nice, IittIe bambina.
You go home to your mama.
- I have no mama.
- That's too bad.
Then go home to your papa.
- Say, what's your name?
- Betsy Ware.
I used to Iive in an orphanage, but they were mean to me, awfuIIy mean.
- And now I'm on a vacation.
- Huh?
I'm on a vacation. To see new faces.
Your face doesn't Iook very new.
WeII, it's good enough for me. Goodbye.
Here comes Papa! Here comes Papa!
- Why you chase me for?
- I'm Betsy Ware.
I used to Iive in an orphanage, but they were awfuI mean to me.
- And now I'm on a vacation.
- I know. You toId me that.
- And you no Iike my face.
- Yes, I do.
(Tony) Ma! Ma!
Who is she?
Mama, maybe she's hungry.
I go get her?
Come, you stay in my house tonight.
Eat the spaghetti. They're good.
Look, Iook. Like this. Look.
- Here.
- Thank you.
- I sneezed.
- Salute.
Salute.
- Don't I have to go to bed?
- What's the matter?
- You're sIeepy?
- You eat first.
I Iike it here.
So IittIe, and so sweet.
Maybe we keep her. Yes?
Are you crazy? What you want to do?
You want to go to jaiI for the kidnap?
Five chiIdren you have aIready.
Six with the monkey.
AII right. Then I take her to the poIiceman in the morning.
Come, bambina.
- So fast she sIeeps.
- Maybe we'II keep her, huh?
Mama, come on! Get up!
This music comes in handy for rehearsing.
- Rehearsing for what?
- Somebody may ask us to pIay a benefit.
Don't forget - we got another radio audition tomorrow.
You know, this radio racket is a Iot tougher than vaudeviIIe used to be.
- Remember when we got married?
- No, and don't remind me.
And, by the way, I'm getting tired of these radio auditions.
If we don't Iand a sponsor soon,
I'm going home to my mother.
WeII, that's better than bringing the oId battIe-axe here. I'm onIy kidding.
Honey, I've been working on a step that's gonna start BiII Robinson taIking to himseIf.
Watch this.
Like to see anybody tie that.
- I'm going to see who that hoofer is!
- WhiIe you're there, take a few Iessons.
(Mama) Bravo, bambina! Bravo!
It's a kid. Jerry, Jerry!
Are you the one who was answering my steps?
- Tony, who is she?
- She's an orphan.
She run away. She foIIow me here.
Jerry, she's a naturaI. Look at her.
Did you ever see a better bet?
- Who is she?
- She's part of our act, kid.
DoIan, DoIan and DoIan.
Say, what's your name?
Betsy Ware. Are you Puddin' Head?
I'II say he's Puddin' Head. Come on.
- What's this aII about?
- Don't you see?
That kid's a noveIty.
Just what we need for the act.
You crazy?
What do you know about the chiId?
AII there is to know.
She ran away from an orphan asyIum.
Orphan asyIum! Did you notice her hands?
They don't manicure 'em in orphan asyIums.
WeII, I don't know. Friend of mine got his hair cut in Sing Sing.
You're aIways making mountains out of mothbaIIs.
Supposing the kid's story does turn out to be a phoney? So we beIieved it.
We fed her, took care of her and put her on the air.
- They can't hang you for that, can they?
- They can try.
Wait a minute.
I want the poIice department.
Bureau of missing persons.
Bureau of missing persons?
Is anybody missing?
Oh, thousands of peopIe?
That's very interesting.
Did anybody report a kid missing by the name of Betsy Ware?
But, Jimmy...
No record? Oh.
No, no. I don't wanna make a report.
No, thanks.
But if I shouId ever Iose a kid by that name,
I'II Iet you know.
What? Oh, wise guy, hey?
- You'd better turn her in anyway.
- I teII you, it's OK.
Wait a minute. Listen, sweetheart. Remember, you're Bonnie DoIan, the radio star.
Don't use your reaI name around here.
Just forget that you're Betsy Ware.
- Are we pIaying a game?
- That's it, a game.
- WiII you pIay aIong with it?
- Mm-hm. I Iove games.
- AII right. Now, don't forget, Betsy.
- The name's Bonnie DoIan.
We're DoIan, DoIan and DoIan.
We have an appointment with Dan Ward of the Ward and WaIIace advertising agency.
Oh, yes. For an audition.
Room B to your right, pIease.
- HeIIo, Mr Ward. Mr Ward.
- Yes?
This is my wife, Jerry.
And this is our kid, Bonnie DoIan.
Have we got an act!
Have we got an act? I'm asking you.

Not bad. I'II be right out.
I have a cIient who might be interested.
You wait here.
- Didn't he Iike what we did?
- Sure.
I guess he's gone to the next room to appIaud.
Margaret? This is Dan. Listen, I've got the greatest act that's ever been offered to radio.
It's no use, Dan.
Mr Peckjust won't go on the air.
I know he won't go for girIs, and I know he won't go for crooners, but he'II go for this.
But you said we were good.
Never pay any attention to what he says.
Maybe we were too good.
- Oh, uh...
- Yes?
- This cIient of mine...
- Yeah?
- ..that I was teIIing you about...
- Yes?
..wiII see you this afternoon.
- We're good!
- We're good! We're good! We're good!
- Can you be there at three?
- Can we be there at three?
- Can we be there at three?
- We'II be there at five minutes to three.
Good afternoon. Peck's Soap Company.
Good afternoon. Peck's Soap Company.
I don't care how good they are!
I teII you, I don't want a radio show!
But, Mr Peck, if you'd onIy give them an audition...
It's a most unusuaI act, Mr Peck.
They'II be up here in a few moments.
- Shut up!
- (phone rings)
Oh.
Mr Barry of the Barry Soap Company is here.
Says he has an appointment.
Do you know what that young upstart wants?
TeIephoned me, said he wanted to see me.
- I have no idea.
- WeII, I have.
He wants me to buy him out.
Buy him out?
Why, Mr Peck, the Barry saIes are...
I know he's been seIIing soap!
But he's been spending 11 cents on baIIyhoo for every 10-cent cake he's soId.
- But the figures show...
- Figures!
It takes no genius to offer five-doIIar biIIs for four eighty and do a voIume of business.
But the day of reckoning is aIways around the corner, and it's caught up with Barry.
ShaII I show him in?
Yes, show him in.
You stay, Gooch.
- WeII, weII. If it isn't Peck's bad girI.
- HeIIo, Mr Barry.
- Mr Peck wants you to go right in.
- That's mighty white of the oId man.
Listen, how wouId you Iike to have Iunch with your boss?
- With my boss?
- Sure. I'm gonna buy up the whoIe shebang.
It's on its Iast Iegs and Peck'II probabIy be gIad to seII it for a song.
- What's funny about that?
- (telephonist) Yes, sir. I'II teII him.
Mr Peck wants to know what's deIaying you.
The oId boy can't wait. See you Iater.
WeII...
Mr Peck...
Yes, Mr Barry?
Just what can I do for you today?
WeII, Peck, I understand that this pIace is going to... going to pot.
Now, I might consider taking it off your hands.
But... do I understand you to say...?
You understand me to say that I'II buy you out. How much?
Have you the coIossaI insoIence to suggest that I seII my business to you?
Why not? You've been Iosing money for two years. You're practicaIIy broke.
Get out! Get out, before I kick you out!
Now get out.
I gather that he doesn't want to seII.
Is that your impression too?
- DefiniteIy.
- Very weII.
Good day.
HeIIo, boss.
Boss or no boss, how about the date for Iuncheon?
WeII, I couIdn't possibIy.
Come on, be a sport.
You're even with me, aren't you?
I'm ahead of you.
When wiII it be?
- Oh, Friday at one?
- Fine. At the Savoy?
Say, Margaret, isn't he one of our competitors?
As far as I'm concerned, he has no competition.
(man) 16.
Peck's Soap Company.

Oh, yes. DoIan, DoIan and DoIan.
And which one are you?
I'm the one in the middIe.
Miss AIIen's busy at the moment.
WiII you wait in her office?
Thank you.
DarIing, don't do that.
Be a good girI and sit down over there.
- I wanna taIk to Puddin' Head a minute.
- Do me a favour and stop worrying.
- You're beginning to Iook terribIe.
- Why wouIdn't I?
I dozed off this morning at 3.30 and sIept Iike a Iog tiII four.
(Jimmy) The way you're acting, you'd think we were kidnappers.
(Jerry) That's what I'm afraid the judge wiII think. We may get off with Iife.
HeIIo.
- How'd you get in here? Who are you?
- I'm Bonnie DoIan, the big radio star.
You know, DoIan, DoIan and DoIan.
And are we good!
Ah.
So they sent you in here to soften me up, did they?
Young Iady, you're wasting your time.
Now get outta here.
- Why have you got so many doors?
- To keep out nuisances one door won't stop.
- But they aII open.
- Ah.
- What's this?
- Nothing to do with you.
Now, get aIong with you.
Why do you want me to go? You're aII aIone, and I'm not doing anything, either.
- TeII me a story.
- I don't know any stories.
You know, you remind me of oId Mr SpindIeshanks.
- Who?
- Mr SpindIeshanks.
He's the grouch in the Betsy Ware stories who heIps Betsy when she's hungry...
Hungry? You're not hungry, are you?
No. I just had Iunch, and I did something bad, too.
- What'd you do?
- WeII, we had spinach.
And whiIe Jimmy wasn't Iooking,
I put mine on his pIate.
No, no. That is wrong.
You shouId have eaten your spinach.
It's good for you.
So I've heard.
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to get aIong.
- Why?
- You said for me to.
I didn't say anything of the kind.
AII I said was that spinach was good for you.
Come back here.
Sit down over there.
Come over here.
You Iike these pictures?
- Do you know something?
- What?
I didn't think I was gonna Iike you at first.
But I Iike you now.
- Do you?
- Yes.
- Your eyebrows are so nice and ragged.
- (stutters)
AII right.
So you're a singer, are you?
Mm-hm.
- Sing a song for me.
- AII right.
? Buy a bar of Barry's
- ? Every grocer carries Barry's...
- Stop it! Stop it, I say!
- What's the matter?
- Where'd you Iearn that trash?
On the radio. I heard it on the radio.
Ah.
Radio. There oughta be a Iaw against it.
Now, come on.
Look at the pictures.
- Do you know how to pIay piggyback?
- (stutters)
- No, I don't think I do.
- Oh, it's easy.
Stand up. Stand up.
Turn round.
Now I put my arms around your neck Iike this.
Now go Iike this.

You'd better go right in.
I'II Iook for the chiId. Right in there.
? Rings on her fingers and beIIs on her toes, she shaII have music wherever she goes
Come in.
Ah.
So you thought you'd trick me into going on the air, did you?
Oh, no.
You deIiberateIy sent this chiId to infIuence me.
WeII, I'II Iet you know, it didn't work.
As a matter of fact, I made up my mind a Iong time ago to go on the air.
But she had nothing to do with it, nothing whatever.
She didn't infIuence me the sIightest.
Now, understand that.
- Yes, of course.
- Arrange for time on the air at once.
I want these foIks to start on a series of 15-minute programmes five nights a week, starting tomorrow night.
Tomorrow night?
But, Mr Peck, I couIdn't possibIy do that...
Then make it possibIe!
Didn't I teII you aII we needed was a break?
- 13 weeks on the dotted Iine.
- It's wonderfuI, Jimmy.
- I hope we cIick.
- Why, we'II knock 'em dead.
- Do we have to kiII peopIe?
- No, we won't kiII them. We'II just sIay them.
Oh.
They'II be on in a few minutes.
And if you wanna see a radio show that'II make yours Iook sick...

- Do you want me to be afraid?
- Heavens, no, darIing.

- Most of it.
But Bonnie goes on again after this orchestra finishes.
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
America's new sweetheart of the year, little Bonnie Dolan will sing her own version of ''When l'm With You''.
? An ordinary day becomes a hoIiday
? When I'm with you
- It's uncanny.
- Isn't she wonderfuI?
I mean her voice, it's... it's just Iike Barbara's.
If I didn't know my chiId was at schooI, I'd swear to it.
AII chiIdren's voices sound about aIike.
It's just that sIight difference that makes Bonnie stand out.
A proud father probabIy wouIdn't even notice that difference.
? Marry me and let me be your wife
- That's Barbara. It is.
- Are you Iosing your mind?
- That's Bonnie DoIan.
- But, I teII you, it's my daughter.
- Where's your phone?
- Right there.
? Even funny spinach tastes Iike pumpkin pie
? When I'm with you
? Ooh
You're just making a compIete idiot of yourseIf...
- Be quiet. CentraI 88632.
- I wiII not be quiet.
You must be crazy.
I know the chiId and her parents.
I teII you, I'm her parent.
HeIIo. This is Richard Barry taIking.
You have my daughter there, the IittIe girI singing on the Peck Hour.
- HoId her. I'II be right over.
- Your daughter.
HeIIo, operator? Give me the Forest Grove
SchooI. At FerncIiff. Yes, quick.
- This is CoIumbus 8514.
- You're just stirring up a mess of troubIe.
- Why are you so stubborn?
- You're stubborn.
Why do I have to marry a girI Iike this?
Who said you're going to?
I wouIdn't marry you...
You'II marry me if I want you to.
- HeIIo?
- This is Richard Barry taIking.
- Is my daughter Barbara there?
- No, Mr Barry. We're waiting for her.
- Haven't you received a wire from her nurse?
- No, Mr Barry. ShaII we...
- She never got to the schooI.
- ReaIIy?
Come on.
And were you good!
We certainIy sIayed them, didn't we?
Come on, darIing.
Great IittIe trooper, that kid.
Just Iike her father. I taught her aII she knows.
When she was six months oId, the name of the act was DoIan and DoIan.
- Then she used to...
- Mr Peck, Mr Barry just phoned.
Said Bonnie is his daughter and wants us to hoId her here.
Barry, huh? Trying to put something over on me again. The nerve!
- What eIse did he say?
- That's aII, except he was on his way over.
Good! I'II teII that cheap upstart just where he gets off.
Trying to steaI my taIent, is he? I'II sue him.
Here, you get your wife and chiId and get them out of here.
I know how to handIe Barry!
- Let's get outta here. Don't ask questions.
- Where are we going?
Taxi!
Taxi!
Taxi!
Listen, honey, teII us the truth.
Do you know Mr Barry?
- You won't be angry if I teII you?
- No, sweetheart.
Mr Barry's my daddy.
I toId you she didn'tjump out of a hat, that they'd catch up with us.
- What'II we do now?
- There's onIy one thing.
Take her home, teIephone Barry where she is and then duck. FIag a taxi.
- Taxi!
- I shouId have known better.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
AII we've got to do is...
Oh.
- An awfuIIy nice kid you have there.
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.
Taxi. Taxi!
(Jerry) DarIing, we've got to go. Something has come up and we've got to go right away.
- (Barbara) Can't I go with you?
- (Jimmy) No, you stay here.
But I don't wanna stay here aII aIone.
Honey, do us a big favour. Stay right here.
Listen, sweet, you stay here, we'II caII your daddy and he'II come for you in a few minutes.
Oh.
Here, sweet. PIay with your toys.
Goodbye, darIing.
Goodbye.
Goodbye, Puddin' Head.
Come on.
A fine cock-and-buII story. If she's your daughter, what's she doing here?
- I have no time to expIain now. Where is she?
- She's gone, and don't teII him where she is.
- Can't you see I'm teIIing you the truth?
- (phone rings)
Yes? Yes.
It's for you, Richard.
Yes?
What's the number of the house?
Yes, what fIoor?
The parIour fIoor, the first door to your Ieft.
I know where she is. She's aII aIone!
Is she reaIIy your daughter?
Isn't that what I've been teIIing you, you crazy oId buzzard?
We're a coupIe of heeIs, running out on the kid.
- I know, but...
- And a coupIe of saps.
- They're bound to get us.
- I guess you're right.
Everybody knows DoIan and DoIan.
They know we had the kid, too.
Of course, and if we run away, it'II Iook worse.
Come on. Let's go back and face it.
Come on, now. Be a nice IittIe girI.
I'II buy you a pretty present if you teII me who your father is.
I won't teII you. I don't Iike you.
- You'd better teII.
- I won't! I won't! You Iet me go!
- No, you don't. You're coming with me.
- I am not! I am not!
I'm waiting! I'm waiting! I promised Jerry!
Hey! Where are you going with that kid?
Jimmy, Iead with your Ieft!
Hit him hard, Puddin' Head!
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
- Daddy! Daddy! Oh, Daddy!
- (Jerry) Are you aII right, Jimmy?
- Who brought you here?
- They did.
- Where's CoIIins?
- I don't know.
She Iost her purse and went away.
So I thought I'd go on a vacation.
I found Tony, and then
Mr and Mrs Puddin' Head found me.
What are they doing, Daddy?
They're hurting them, and they're my friends.
They're my best friends.
They saved me from that bad man.
She toId us she ran away from an orphan asyIum, and we beIieved her.
- Didn't you teII us that, Bonnie?
- Yes, I did.
But I wasn't teIIing a Iie. I was just pIaying a game, and they pIayed with me.
I see.
I've never had so much fun in my whoIe Iife.
But I'm gIad to be back with you, Daddy.
Barbara. Officers,
I'm afraid I've put you to a Iot of bother.
- You needn't hoId those peopIe any Ionger.
- Wait. I've got a contract.
- You know what that contract's worth?
- You've been trying to buy each other out.
Why don't you merge the two companies?
You can wash the neck of the whoIe nation.
- That's a thought.
- Merge with him? Never!
I don't know what that means, but why don't you do it?
? When I hear the bIast of a bugIe
? I know I soon wiII see
? A miIitary man

Heidi!
Put those on!
Oh, not everything.
I'm so hot.
Well, keep on your Sunday dress... and your coat.
- Hurry up!
- Oh, all right.
Come a long way?
Yes. From Mayenfeld.
We had a ride part of the way on a cart.
Can you tell me the way to Adolph Kramer's?
Did you say Adolph Kramer?
I did.
A stranger hereabouts, aren't you?
Yes. Why?
You must be, or you would have... nothing to do with that old heathen!
Heathen or not, I'm taking his granddaughter to live with him.
Well do you know what kind of a man he is?
That's none of my affair.
Which path do I take?
There, by the church.
If you listen to us, you'll never take it.
Um-
Umm.
Hey! Turk!
Everybody knows you can't turn your back on old Turk.
Well, old Turk isn't much of a gentleman.
What's your name?
I'm Peter, the goat general.
Who are you?
I'm Heidi, and I'm going to live with Adolph Kramer, my grandfather.
Live with him?
Aren't you scared to?
Why should I be afraid of my grandfather?
You'll find out. If ever he gets good and mad at you... he'll probably cut your head off.
Like this!
Oh.
I don't care what you say.
She's my niece, and I can do what I please with her.
Come along.
Come along. Hurry!
I'm Dete, the sister of Gretchen... who married your son Tobias.
I've brought their orphan to live with you.
I've taken care ofher for six years... but I've got a job in Frankfurt now- a rich family- and I can't be bothered with her anymore,
I know you hated
Tobias and Gretchen... but you've got to take their daughter just the same.
Get out of here.
Here she is!
Her name's Heidi!
How do you do,
Grandfather?
I'm very glad to see you.
Aren't you going to show me our house?
Oh. It's a very fine house, isn't it?
Whew!
Where am I going to sleep?
Grandfather!
I found my bed.
I'll sleep on the hay.
But I suppose I ought to have a sheet and coverlet.
I say, I suppose I ought to have a sheet and coverlet.
Well...
I've always had a sheet and coverlet... but if there aren't any,
I could sleep under the hay.
Could I use these?
Grandfather, it's a beautiful bed.
Would you like to come and see?
Oh! Is that for me?
Thank you.
Ow.
Now I've got a table all my own.
Hello, laddie.
Is this Blind Anna's cottage?
- Yes. She's my grandmother.
- Thank you.
I do not know this Adolph Kramer, but the village thinks... the child should be taken away from him.
You've just come to
Dorfli, Herr Pastor... or you'd understand why.
They say you have known
Kramer for 50 years.
- What sort of a man is he?
- Who knows?
He was a grand young man, except for his wild temper.
And his son grew up just like him.
Tobias wanted to marry a girl from Mayenfeld.
Adolph disliked her and forbade it, but the boy married her... just the same and brought her home,
Adolph turned them away in a rage... and told Tobias never to come back... until he'd given up the girl.
But why should the village hate him and fear him so?
Feuds and weeds grow quickly, Herr Pastor.
The people of the village sided with the boy... and the father cursed them... and went and built himself a hut on the mountain.
Since that day, he's never spoken to a living soul.
Frau Anna, is the child safe with him?
God knows.
Living alone like that has made him a strange creature.
I like to hear the church bells, don't you, Grandfather?
- Get to bed.
- Shall I say my prayers out here with you?
- I told you to go to bed!
- Yes, Grandfather.
I think I'll go to bed now,
Grandfather. Good night!
And God bless Grandfather, and please make him like me.
And please make me a good little girl. Amen.
And please make Aunt Dete stay in Frankfurt for a long, long time.
Amen.
- Is this for me?
- Yes.
It's the most beautifulest chair I ever saw.
- Thank you,
- Mm.
- What are you making?
- Cheese.
Could I help?
Stir.
Do please help me tie my apron.
Agh!
Thank you.
- Are these ours, Grandfather?
- Mm-hmm.
- What are their names?
- Swanly and Bearly.
You don't look much like a swan... and you don't look anything like a bear.
I think you're a beautiful goat.
I wonder if you give black milk?
- You can milk Bearly.
- But I don't know how to milk a goat.
Well, then, it's time you learned. This way.
You may as well stand still.
I'm going to do it.
Oh, please, Swanly.
Don't be so st- stubborn.
Oh!
Bearly's a very warm goat, isn't she?
Pretty hard work, isn't it, Grandfather?
Is this the last load?
Not quite. The rabbit's fur is thick. It'll be a hard winter.
We don't care if it's a hard winter, do we?
There's wood to keep us warm and cheese to eat... and lots of hay for Swanly and Bearly.
May I go with Peter today?
It may be the last time before the snows.
All right. All right.
But be back early for your lessons.
I will.
Are you sure you can get along without me?
I'll try.
- You're supposed to be asleep.
- My eyes couldn't stay shut.
Look what I found!
Well.
Do you think there's any music left in it?
We'll see.
I'm afraid it's all tired out.
Hm.
Oh!
This looks like a wonderful story!
What's it about?
It's about magic wooden shoes.
All right, Grandfather, I'm ready.
Now... a long, long time ago... there was a little
Dutch girl named Netje,
Have you seen my new shoes
They are made out of wood
Such nice little shoes
Don't you think they look good
I can dance all around
With the greatest of ease
I can jump from the ground
To the top of the trees
I'll tell you something
I'm going to try
Put on your shoes and away we'll fly
We'll take a trip wherever we choose
We'll dance and skip in our little wooden shoes
How many miles will you travel with me
One mile or two miles and maybe three
We'll make a stop wherever we choose
We'll skip and hop in our little wooden shoes
Wasn't our journey a nice holiday
We'll take another some other day
We'll take a trip wherever we choose
We'll dance and skip in our little wooden shoes
- Hello.
- Oh!
- You come to see us?
- Yes, dear.
- I am Pastor Schultz.
- How do you do, Pastor Schultz?
How do you do, Frau Schultz?
Oh, no. I'm Fraulein Elsa, the schoolmistress.
Oh, you'd make a very nice Frau Schultz.
You're mending your grandfather's coat. How nice.
It's his Sunday coat, but he never wears it. He doesn't go to church.
Perhaps we could persuade him to go,
Would you like that?
The pastor and Fraulein Elsa have come to see us. Isn't that nice?
- Good day, neighbor.
- Well?
- We've come to ask about the child.
- Go inside, Heidi.
Save your breath.
I have nothing to say to you.
- That seems to settle it.
- No, it doesn't.
I'm sorry to insist, neighbor, but school will open soon.
- I'll not send Heidi to school.
- What will you do with her, then?
She will thrive up here with the goats and the birds.
- What will she learn from them?
- At least she will learn no evil!
That's hardly enough schooling for a child.
I'll teach her all that's necessary.
And you'll teach her religion too?
The mountains will teach her the only religion worth having... as I have found out.
Come back to Dorfli, neighbor. This is no life up here for you and the child- at enmity with God and man.
I know what they think of me in Dorfli, and they know what I think of them.
- It's better that we keep apart.
- I should not like to appeal to the law.
Heidi shall not go to school or to church, either. That is final!
I'm sorry, neighbor.
May God help you.
And if any man try to take Heidi away from me...
God help him,!
I used to go to Sunday school when I lived in Mayenfeld.
Are you going to be my
Sunday school teacher too?
We'll have our first lesson now.
I'd like to read this story.
Shall I?
"A certain man had two sons... and the...
Y- O-U-N-G-E-R-"
Younger.
"and the younger of them said to his father...
'Father, give me the P-O-R-"'
These are pretty hard words.
Perhaps you'd better help me.
"Give me the portion of goods that fall unto me. "
And he divided unto them his levy... and the younger son gathered all together... and took his journey into a far country.
You know this story by heart.
Yes. By heart.
Does the son ever go home to his father?
And the son said...
"Father, I have sinned against heaven... and in thy sight... and am no more worthy to be called thy son. "
But the father said to his servants...
"Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him... and put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet... for this my son was dead and is alive again.
He was lost... and is found. "
"If a man have a hundred sheep... and one of them be gone astray... doth he not leave the 90 and 9... and goeth into the mountains... and seeketh that which has gone astray?
And if-"
Peter, what is it?
The grandfather and Heidi have come to church.
"And if so be that he find it... verily, I say unto you... he rejoiceth more of that sheep... than of the 90 and 9 which went not astray. "
Holy God we praise thy name
Lord of all we bow before thee
All on earth thy scepter claim
All in heaven above adore thee
Fill the heavens with sweet accord
Holy, holy holy, Lord
Holy
Holy, holy Lord
Good day, Adolph.
Good day.
Good to see you and the child.
You're looking well.
Here comes the grandfather now.
So the old eagle has come down from his perch.
It was lonely for Heidi.
Adolph, you're an old fraud.
Don't give me away.
Well-
I ask the Herr Pastor to forgive the words I said on the mountain.
The words are forgotten, neighbor.
This is a happy day for all of us.
I hope we shall see you here often.
- What do you say, Heidi?
- Well, I think everybody... really ought to go to church on Sunday... and I think there ought to be a Frau Schultz.
Aunt Dete, what- what do you want here?
Where's your grandfather?
He's up on the mountain cutting some logs.
Get on your coat and mittens.
We're going away.
I don't want to go away!
- What?
- I want to stay here.
I love the grandfather, and he loves me.
It's my birthday, and we're going to have a party.
Look. He made me these for a present.
There's Swanly and Bearly. And we're going down to the village to get sausage and butter... because the grandmother and Peter are coming.
Well, he won't mind you going on a little trip with me.
- Where?
- Just to Frankfurt.
You can come back whenever you like.
- I don't want to go to Frankfurt.
- You will do as I say!
- Where are your clothes?
- I've got to ask the grandfather first.
- Where are they?
- In there.
Now, there is nothing to worry about.
We'll have a sleigh ride to Mayenfeld and a nice trip on a train.
And I'll buy you a present for your birthday.
- Can I come right back for my party?
- Didn't I tell you you could?
Can I bring some soft rolls for the grandmother?
You see, she hasn't many teeth and can't eat her black bread.
Oh, yes. Come!
Hurry up! Hurry up!
First, I must go up the mountain and tell the grandfather where I'm going.
There isn't time. We might miss our train!
I'll send word back to him!
But I'd rather tell him myself.
Do you think if I put my birthday shoes by the fire...
- he'd know I'm coming back?
- Yes, yes, of course.
Now, come along!
Heidi?
Heidi?
Heidi!
Heidi! Where are you?
- Good day, little Heidi.
- Good day, Herr Pastor.
- Are you going away?
- Yes, to Frankfurt with Aunt Dete.
I'm taking her for a little trip,
Herr Pastor. It's her birthday.
- Oh, how kind of you. Pleasant journey to you, Fraulein.
- Thank you.
Oh, there's the grandfather.
I must go tell him.
- Sit down! Drive on!
- Grandfather!
Have you seen her?
Heidi! She's gone!
Don't you know?
Her aunt has taken her to Frankfurt.
She's stolen her!
Where are they?
Stolen? There.
Heidi!
- I don't think I'll go any farther.
- Oh, yes, you will.
Aunt Dete, tell them to stop!
Keep quiet.
I can't stop the train.
You've got to. It's getting late.
I'll never get back tonight!
Of course you won't.
Sit down and keep still.
- Then you-you knew all the time?
- Well, what if I did?
There's going to be sausage and butter at my party... and I won't be there.
And- And the grandfather will be lonely.
Do you remember what I told you?
I'm to say to the lady...
"How do you do,
Fraulein Rottenmeier?"
And to Klara,
"How do you do, Fraulein Klara?
I hope you will be well soon. "
But why are we going to their house?
You'll find out when we get there.
"The quality of a young lady's breeding... is indicated by her deportment when elders are present.
At such times, her manner should be sedate and diffident. "
It's time for them to be here, Fraulein.
Remember, Klara, no excitement.
You're still an invalid.
"The habit of interruption... should always be frowned upon.
The well-bred young lady always waits until her elders are silent. "
I wonder what she'll be like.
Your father expects a healthy, unspoiled, mountain child... of your age to share your studies.
Personally, I think the whole plan is a mistake.
Papa thought it might be good for me to have a playmate.
But you have me.
Don't I give you my entire time and devotion?
Yes, and it's very kind of you... but I don't have much fun.
Whoa!
Now, remember.
My word!
Well, come on.
Announce us.
Where did you pick up that?
- That is my niece.
- How unfortunate for the poor child.
Are you the king here?
You look like a king.
Ah, little fraulein, if only the rest of the world... could see through your eyes.
Hmm, quite a personage... under that extraordinary hat.
They are here, Fraulein.
- Andrews, what is she like?
- Highly intelligent.
- Don't be misled by the hat.
- Show them in,
How do you do,
Fraulein Rottenmeier?
- What is your name?
- Heidi.
Heidi?
Ridiculous.
What name did they give you when you were baptized?
I don't remember that.
Are you being impudent?
No, Fraulein.
She didn't understand.
- She was baptized Adelheid.
- Hmm.
She looks too young.
How old is she?
She's older than she appears.
She's nearly 11.
Aunt Dete doesn't tell the truth.
I'm eight years old today.
Grandfather was going to give me a birthday party.
How far have you gone in school?
I've never gone at all.
How do you do, Fraulein Klara?
I hope you will be well soon.
Not fraulein. I'm just Klara, and I'll call you Heidi.
- Why do you sit in that chair with wheels?
- I can't walk.
I fell last summer and hurt my back.
That's when Fraulein Rottenmeier came to take care of me.
Then you couldn't climb the mountain with Goat Peter, Swanly and Bearly.
Who are they?
Are they friends of yours?
Yes. They're the grandfather's goats... and Peter, he's the goat general.
Oh, tell me about them.
That's enough! You will take that impossible child back!
You'll have to give me more expense money then... and the 50 marks
Herr Sesemann promised.
You dare to speak to me like that?
- I'll not give you one pfennig!
- You'd better.
I've brought just the kind of child
Herr Sesemann asked for... unless you have your own reasons for not wanting her.
Get out, and take your wretched niece with you!
All right, but you'll give me the money... or I'll write to Herr Sesemann.
You think I don't know what your little game is?
A rich widower and his sick child.
You don't want Klara to get well... not yet... not until you've made him think... his little darling can't live without you.
Now you can get rid of the "impossible child" yourself!.
Sell her to the Gypsies, for all I care!
I'm afraid the grandfather will be worried.
He didn't know I was going away, so I must go back tomorrow.
- Didn't Dete tell you?
- What?
- That you're to live here with me,
- No, she didn't tell me.
You see, my mama's dead, and my papa's business keeps him in Paris most of the time.
- And I haven't anyone to play with.
- I can't live here!
I'm going back to the grandfather right away!
- Indeed, you are.
- No, I like her!
Andrews will take you home in the morning.
- No, I want her to stay!
- That is for me to decide.
- I know what is best for you, Klara.
- No! No! Papa sent for her, and you've got to wait till he comes home!
Klara, you're not strong enough for this excitement. You'll make yourself ill.
Yes, I will, I know I will if you don't let me keep Heidi!
- But, Klara, I can't stay!
- Quiet, dear.
Quiet. Remember what a sick little girl you are.
You do want me to get well, don't you, Fraulein?
- How can you ask?
- Then- Then please let me keep Heidi.
- Very well. For the present.
- You can't keep me here!
The grandfather is waiting.
He doesn't know where I am!
Dinner is served.
You'll like it here, Heidi.
We'll have such good times together.
And Fraulein can send word to your grandfather.
No, no! Aunt Dete must take me home!
Dinner is waiting.
We will attend to that tomorrow.
- Then it's all right? I can go?
- I said in the morning, Adelheid.
Adelheid...
I am waiting.
For what we are about to receive... the Lord make us truly thankful.
God bless Grandfather and Swanly and Bearly... and please make me a good little girl.
- Amen.
- Ha!
You may serve.
Remember, Klara, only a little,
- Must you hoard your food, Adelheid?
- It's for the grandmother.
I'm going to take it home with me tomorrow.
Put it back.
- What's that?
- It's technically known as false hare.
I think you'll find it rather tasty.
Will you serve yourself?
I think I'd rather just have some cheese.
Evidently our little friend has no idea of table manners.
Bring me the tray, Andrews.
Now watch, Adelheid.
This is the way civilized people serve themselves,
Stop!
Oh, dear, what a pity.
You may go.
This is not humorous.
You are not in your barbarous hut in the Alps now, but in a cultured home.
Adelheid,!
Did I actually see you yawn?
- I'm horrified!
- Don't scold her.
She's had such a hard day.
I am trying to be patient, Klara.
But it is the height of impropriety to yawn at the dinner table.
Ayawn at any time is a sign of disrespect... and lack of control,
It shows the attention is wandering... and that the young person is not interested in the improvement of her mind.
Oh!
Why, it's really more than it's worth.
- You're going for the child?
- I am.
You're not walking all the way to Frankfurt? It's over 100 miles.
- I shall get there.
- Let us lend you enough railway fare.
That's kind of you, Franz... but my legs will carry me.
I have money to bring us back on the train.
- Auf Wiedersehen. - Good luck,
Adolph. - Godspeed to you, neighbor.
Well, Little Miss Hasty Pudding.
I heard Goat Peter's horn.
He must be looking for me.
- Goat Peter?
- Yes. There. Don't you hear it?
I say, it's a little chilly outside for this sort of thing, isn't it?
Let's try the window. Come on.
Fresh fish!
Fresh fish!
Oh, it isn't Goat Peter at all.
It's only fresh fish.
You'd better get dressed, little fraulein.
Breakfast will be soon.
Well, I never thought I'd turn out to be a lady's maid.
There.
Hurry up.
Breakfast in 10 minutes,
Adelheid.
We insist on punctuality in this household.
"Punctuality. "
Don't dawdle.
"Adelheid-"
- Well, I-
- Shh!
It is the height of punctuality to yawn at the dinner table.
Isn't Heidi the funniest little thing?
I'm so glad she's going to stay.
- Is she?
- Yes, but she doesn't know it.
The poor dear thinks she's going home today.
But she'll be happier here.
Don't you think so?
I'll have some new dresses made for her.
Do you think you could manage a new hat?
Oh, Heidi!
It's lovely!
I wonder where Aunt Dete is.
It's time we started.
Oh, uh, don't think about that now.
We're going to have our lessons with Fraulein in a minute.
Well, maybe I could just this once... if there's time.
I'll be sorry to leave you.
I hope you begin to walk soon... and not have to sit in that chair.
Fraulein says perhaps
I'll never walk again.
Well, Goat Peter said
I'd never learn to read... but the grandfather told me I could, and I did.
Your back feels just like mine.
And your legs do too.
I should think you could walk if you wanted to enough.
- Why don't you try?
- Oh, I wouldn't dare.
- Why not?
- I might fall.
Lean on me.
I'm pretty strong.
Do you really think
I could walk?
We'll try, then we'd find out.
Come on, put your hand on me.
No, no, I can't!
- Don't ever tell Fraulein!
- I won't.
- What's that?
- A monkey.
I'd better let her in.
She's sitting in the snow.
Oh, Fraulein wouldn't like it.
She wouldn't want her to catch cold.
Besides, I've never met a monkey. Have you?
No. Not to speak to.
Oh, she says she's very cold.
Come on! Come on!
How are you?
She has very nice manners.
Fraulein Rottenmeier would like you. Come on.
Doorbell when the hall's being washed down!
- I want-a Louise.
- You want what?
- Louise, a-my monkey.
- Monkey? You've been misinformed.
This is not the zoo!
You'd make a very nice schoolteacher.
She wants you to name the principal rivers of Europe.
I'm afraid that's too hard.
Can't you ask me something easier?
If you young ladies have finished with you vulgar display of lack of restraint... we will begin our lessons.
Andrews! Andrews!
Help! Help!
Did you call?
Take that thing out of here!
My word. A gorilla!
Well, don't stand there fiddle-faddy.
Take that beast out of here!
This is no laughing matter!
Yes, uh, scat,!
Do you mind? Scat,!
Aah!
Get him off!.
Get him off!.
Oh, oh, oh!
- Oh, I'm most awfully sorry. This is most undignified.
- How dare you!
This is really not my fault.
Can I help you up at all? There we go!
Well!
Get him out ofhere,!
Oh, my God!
You might try putting salt on her tail.
- Ah, what we need is strategy.
- Can I get it for you?
No, thank you.
I think I've got it.
Now the rest of you draw fire.
I'll attack from the rear.
Come here, little monkey! come here,! come,! come,!
- Come on! Come on!
- Here, monkey!
This has gone far enough!
Come on in.
Louise! Louise!
- She'll come down now. Here's your papa.
- Come, Louise.
Better get out quickly before she finds her tongue.
- Here you are.
- What's the matter with you?
- Who let that beast in?
- I did.
- But she was so cold out in the snow.
- That's no concern of ours.
Please, Fraulein, it was my fault as much as hers.
Such conduct is inexcusable!
She shall be punished severely!
Don't you touch her!
I'll write Papa!
Oh, I'm sorry, dear.
Don't excite yourself.
I'd forgotten it might upset you.
Adelheid, you shall spend the rest of the day in your room.
I can't do that.
Aunt Dete is going to take me home.
Your aunt went away this morning.
She... went away?
But she's coming back.
- No, she's not. I discharged her.
- But she's got to take me home!
I'm afraid not.
She cares nothing about you.
- She told me to sell you to the Gypsies.
- Oh, Fraulein, don't.
I doubt whether you will ever see your Aunt Dete again.
- What does this mean?
- You mustn't stop me!
What have you got in that hat?
- Oh. So you were running away.
- I wasn't running away.
I was just going home by myself.
- Andrews, throw these rolls in the dustbin.
- Oh, no.
They're for the grandmother.
She can't eat her black bread.
Throw that wretched hat in the dustbin too.
Oh, no. Not my hat.
I need that to go home.
That is all, Andrews.
If you stop me, I'll run away again!
I can't stay here!
There aren't any pine trees or any mountains!
The grandfather doesn't know where I am!
- You've got to let me go!
- Stop this nonsense!
You're not going home until I send you!
Now you march upstairs!
You leave your room again today, you'll be whipped!
Come on, little fraulein.
Keep the chin up.
Here's your precious bonnet.
Don't you think we ought to put it under the bed to avoid the dustbin?
Try and cheer her up, dear, will you?
Oh, Heidi, I-
I didn't know you wanted to go home so much.
But you mustn't run away again.
- Promise you won't.
- Oh, no. I couldn't promise.
You must, Heidi.
Papa's coming home for Christmas.
That's only two weeks more.
If- If you still feel homesick then...
I'll ask him to send you back.
Are you sure he will?
Oh, yes.
He'll do it for me.
I won't run away.
I promise.
Come in.
I'm all new to meet Klara's papa.
And, I must say, very impressive.
And just look at this!
I was hoping for a new hat.
But I'm not going to wear my new clothes...
- when I go home tonight.
- No?
The grandfather might not know me.
You're going to leave us tonight, are you?
Yes. Klara's gonna ask her papa to send me.
He'll be here in a few moments, and I've come to tell you that when you meet him... you're to say, "How do you do, gracious sir?"
- And make him a little curtsy.
- What's that?
Well, it's uh-
That's a funny way to say how do you do.
I daresay, but don't you think you ought to practice it?
How do you do, gracious sir?
Yes, I think that ought to do.
A merry Christmas to you, sir.
- Merry Christmas to you, Andrews.
- Thank you, sir.
- Everything all right?
- Oh, yes, sir. Quite all right.
Quite all right.
- Merry Christmas, Karl.
- Merry Christmas to you, sir.
Welcome, Herr Sesemann.
Oh, thank you,
Fraulein Rottenmeier.
- How is Klara?
- As well as may be expected... considering what we've been through.
I didn't want to disturb you by writing...
- but the child Dete brought is impossible.
- Indeed!
Her manners are dreadful, and she excites
Klara to do things beyond her strength.
I've been seriously worried.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Why didn't you send the girl away?
Klara took an absurd fancy to the child... and I hadn't the heart to cross her.
You know I'm foolishly fond of dear Klara.
But I hope you'll act immediately for the sake of Klara's health.
- Papa, Papa, I'm waiting,!
- Coming, dear.
We will discuss this later, Fraulein.
- Oh, Papa, I'm so glad to see you.
- Oh, darling.
Klara, what has happened?
I expected-
That is, Fraulein told me-
But you haven't looked so well since your accident.
Of course.
Because I've been so happy.
- It's Heidi. My little companion.
- Heidi?
Thank you a thousand times for letting me have her.
But Fraulein seems to think she excites you beyond your strength.
I like to be excited, and she makes something funny happen all the time.
Oh, Papa, she's the dearest little thing.
Well, my darling, something has had an amazing effect on you.
I didn't have much to look forward to before.
Now when I wake up,
I think...
"I'm going to spend the day with Heidi!"
I don't see why
Fraulein doesn't like her.
Nor I. It's very odd.
This, sir, is Fraulein Heidi.
How do you do, Heidi?
How do you do, Sir Gracious?
I didn't do it very well.
Shall I try it again?
I don't think that could be improved upon.
We're going in to the
Christmas tree in a minute.
You'll never guess what your present is, will he, Heidi?
Let me see. Is it animal, vegetable or mineral?
Well, I suppose it's sort of animal.
I know. It's a Shetland pony.
We're ready for the ceremony, Herr Sesemann.
Come on, Sir Gracious!
Here we go.
Remember, don't excite yourself.
You'll tire easily.
Yes, Fraulein.

Lovely, Heidi! Lovely.
Merry Christmas to you all... and thank you for another year's faithful service.
Our Christmas greetings to you, sir, and Fraulein Klara.
A long life and good health to you both.
- Thank you, Andrews.
- We're very grateful, sir.
- Karl.
- Thank you, sir.
- Fritz.
- Thank you very much, sir.
- Merry Christmas, Frieda.
- Oh, thank you, sir.
We'll wait till we've had our presents.
He thinks it's going to be an animal.
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas to you, sir.
For your Christmas,
Fraulein. And thank you... for the efficient management of my household.
Thank you, Herr Sesemann.
I've always felt like a mother to Klara.
Now, Papa, my present to Heidi first.
- Oh, Klara. Your back.
- Oh.
I forgot.
That one, Papa.
- Happy Christmas to you, my dear.
- Thank you.
To Klara, from her doting papa.
Turn it upside down, then right-side up, Heidi.
It's the grandfather's house!
He's bringing in the wood.
Can I keep it for always?
Longer than that.
Oh! Heidi, look!
- Oh!
- It's lovely.
Now it's my turn.
I don't see... my Shetland pony around anywhere.
Shall we give him his present now?
You hold my doll, Fraulein.
Now watch, Papa.
You stand over there.
- Don't be afraid.
- I'm not.
- Klara, stop!
- Wait!
Lean on me until you get started.
Now, try hard.
Merry Christmas, Papa.
Oh, my darling.
My darling child.
They told me you might never walk again.
- How did you? How did it happen?
- Heidi taught me.
Heidi-
I was afraid, but she made me try.
We did a little more every day.
You dear child, you've worked a miracle.
Oh, no. It was the grandfather.
Goat Peter said
I'd never learn to read... but the grandfather said
I could if I wanted to... and I did.
So I thought Klara could walk if she wanted to... and she did.
You've given me the happiest
Christmas of my life.
And I've had a nice
Christmas present too.
Shall I get ready to go home now?
No. I have another
Christmas present for you- a home with us as long as you live.
- No. I couldn't do that.
- Why not?
The grandfather's been waiting for me... such a long time.
Oh, Heidi, I hoped you wouldn't want to go now.
Yes, I'd like to be that... but I've got to go home.
Papa, I told Heidi you'd let her go if she wanted to.
But you don't understand, dear.
You'll be my own daughter.
You'll have clothes like Klara's... everything just like hers... and grow up to be a great lady.
- Now, wouldn't you like that?
- No, thank you.
I want to go home to my grandfather.
- I can't let you do that.
- But Klara promised!
- I- - I'm sorry, Heidi.
Someday you'll understand.
Papa, I did promise you'd send her home.
But dear, you don't know what her grandfather's like.
Dete told me that he was a very brutal man... feared by everyone.
No, Heidi will be much happier here with us.
You!
You've spoiled everything!
Don't break my snowstorm!
Fraulein Rottenmeier,!
What is the meaning of this?
Forgive me, Herr Sesemann,
I- I was beyond myself.
You must realize I cannot have you longer in my employ.
- Yes, Herr Sesemann.
- I'll give you a month's salary.
You will arrange to leave tomorrow.
Grandfather.
Grandfather.
I'll never see you again.
- Looking for somebody?
- My granddaughter.
You might find her at the theater.
Every youngster in town tries to get there on Christmas day.
Yes. She might be there.
Thank you.
- What is it, Grandpa?
- I'm looking for my granddaughter.
- But you can't go inside.
- I must see if she's here.
Sorry, sir.
The performance is just over.
You better wait over there.
All right.
Santa Claus!
- Santa Claus!
- Santa Claus!
Santa Claus!
Oh, Heidi, see the funny
Santa Claus over there?
Where? I can't see.
Papa, please take us over to see him.
We better not, dear. You've had too much excitement for one day.
- But Heidi hasn't seen him.
- Never mind. I don't care.
Heidi!
Heidi, where are you?
It's the grandfather calling me!
It couldn't be your grandfather, Heidi.
It sounded just like him.
You must be mistaken, dear. Your grandfather is 100 miles away on his mountain.
I'm almost sure I heard him.
I know it was his voice!
Grandfather! Grandfather!
Where are you?
Heidi! Heidi!
Whoa!
Don't you worry.
That wasn't your grandfather.
Heidi!
Heidi!
- Heidi!
- What do you want?
I thought this was the sleigh.
It must be the right street.
Heidi!
Schutzmann,
That old fellow is acting very strangely.
I think you'd better keep an eye on him.
Is my granddaughter here?
A child named Heidi.
Your granddaughter?
It isn't likely.
I'll see for myself!.
Come here!
What are you doing here?
I'm looking for my granddaughter.
She may be in this house!
- Come! Come!
- You better come with us.
She's in one of these houses.
I'll not leave till I find her!
- What is this?
- You can't disturb people!
Herr Wachtmeister,
I heard her cry out from the sleigh.
I tell you, she's in some trouble.
We can't have you beating on all the doors of Frankfurt at this hour!
- I must find her.
- Of course. Of course.
But she can come to no harm tonight.
If you're still worried in the morning, we'll investigate your story.
I tell you,
I must find her tonight!
- Lock him up.
- The cells are full, Herr Wachtmeister.
Naturally, naturally.
Christmas night.
- Put him in the detention room then.
- But, Herr Wachtmeister-
Take him away.
Stop that.
Christmas comes but once a year
Ja, and with it comes too much beer. christmas comes but once a year
With it comes too much beer
Heidi. Get up.
And be very quiet.
Why? What's the matter?
We're going away.
Oh, is it morning already, and you're going to take me home?
Yes, that's it.
We're going home.
But I thought Andrews was going to take me.
Shh. He can't. You're to go with me. Now dress quickly.
If You are a just and merciful God... then help me... in this hour in my need.
Hurry up!
But first I must go and say good-bye to Klara and her papa.
No, you can't disturb them so early.
I said good-bye for you.
Oh, wait. I forgot.
Don't do that again!
Heidi! Heidi!
I'll put a stop to that.
Ah, let the poor chap enjoy his Christmas.
Why, it isn't morning at all.
- It's still night.
- Shh! It's a long way.
You've got to catch an early train.
- This isn't the right way!
- I know what I'm doing!
I don't think I'll go with you.
I'll wait for Andrews.
He will have to find you first.
Let me go!
Let me go!
- This is the child.
- Ah.
Nice little girl.
Let me go!
I want my grandfather!
- You'll never see your grandfather again.
- Come on!
Come on.
Ayyy!
- Heidi! Heidi!
- Grandfather,! Grandfather,!
Grandfather!
Grandfather!
- Heidi!
- Grandfather,!
Grandfather, she's hurting me!
Grandfather, take me home!
What happened?
What's the matter?
That old man stole my child.
Hey, you! Stop!
Stop!
- They've stolen my sled.
- Who owns this one?
- I do.
- Get in, and follow that man.
- What happened?
- Stolen sleigh!
Follow that man with the child!
Stop!
Stop, or I'll shoot!
Whoa!
You broke out of jail.
You took a sled that did not belong to you.
You stole that child,!
- He didn't steal me!
- I tell you, she's mine!
Silence!
Herr Captain, we have found the woman.
Good. Bring her in.
- Is this your child?
- Yes, Herr Captain.
No, I'm not!
Is this the man who struck you and took her away from you?
- Yes.
- She's lying!
I don't know who she is or what she's doing, but Heidi is mine!
That's enough!
You will be held for trial.
You stupid fools!
- Can't you see what you're doing?
- Lock him up,!
You can't! You're not going to take her away from me again!
No! No, you mustn't take him away!
He's telling the truth!
He is my grandfather.
My really and truly grandfather!
Please! Please let him go!
- Come on! Don't be hysterical.
- Grandfather!
We'll want you for the trial,
Take your child home,
I am not her child!
She's a bad lady!
She tried to sell me to the Gypsies!
Please.
Please let the grandfather take me home.
He didn't mean to do anything bad.
I'll work hard and pay back for everything he broke.
- So will Swanly and Bearly.
- Pay no attention to her.
She'll be all right when I get her to bed.
I won't go with her!
She broke my snowstorm... and sent my Aunt Dete away so she couldn't take me home to the mountains!
If you don't believe me just ask Herr Sesemann.
- He'll tell you the truth.
- Herr Sesemann?
What has Herr Sesemann to do with this?
- Nothing. Nothing at all.
- He has too.
Aunt Dete brought me there to play with Klara.
- I taught her her how to walk.
- Oh, this is ridiculous.
- Come along.
- Just a minute.
- Well, now, Lieutenant- - Perhaps we'd better send for Herr Sesemann.
Oh, absurd! We- Well, we visited the Sesemann house tonight.
Christmas, you know.
My sister's governess there.
It would be highly improper to disturb Herr Sesemann at this hour!
I think you'd better wait until we hear... what Herr Sesemann has got to say.
Grandfather!
Grandfather!
Dear, dear, dear.
Seems quite impossible.
Nothing emerges from the spigot.
- Not that way!
- Oh.
That way.
My word!
I say, Bearly's a very warm goat, isn't she?
- Of course, silly. All goats are warm.
- How cozy.
Heidi,! Heidi,!
They're coming,!
Really ought to master this.
Let's have a race to the grandfather.
Well, well.
Oh, Grandfather, this is Klara.
And just think- she beat me running!
And I beat Herr Sesemann.
How do you do?
This is the grandmother and Goat Peter.
And this is Pastor Schultz and Frau Schultz.
I guess I can't deny it this time.
They were married yesterday.
Come, sit down, all of you!
You must be starved after your climb up the mountain.
Bless us, O Lord, in these Thy gifts... which we are about to receive from Thy bounty.
And please make every little boy and girl in the world as happy as I am.
Amen.
-Happy birthday, Mrs. Hawkins.
-Yes, Mrs. Hawkins.
Younger every year.
None of your frippery, John Harrow.
But music and friends do make you feeI--
-Where's Jim?
-He's in the kitchen, I think.
Just put a head on that one, John.
It's going to thunder and Iightning.
Then you best go
Iock yourseIf up in a cIoset.
You made that cake?
No, I didn't.
And I'II thank you not to say I did.
Jim Hawkins made a cake!
Jim Hawkins made a cake!
No, I didn't.
OnIy girIs make cakes.
My mother made this cake herseIf.
SureIy she had to have a cake for her birthday.
Jim Hawkins dropped a cake!
Jim Hawkins dropped a cake!
Jim Hawkins dropped a cake!
Stop foIIowing me around.
Upon my souI!
Why, Jim, you didn't go and bake a--?
Here's the cake you made, Mother.
I trust it's good.
It's the best cake ever.
I raise a mug to Jim Hawkins, proprietor of the AdmiraI Benbow.
-Jim.
-Speech!
-Come on, get up.
-Speech, speech.
WeII, I don't know what to say, but ever since Father died. . .
. . .and with Mother having to do the work, I'm gIad each time she gets oIder.
I mean, then I get oIder too.
And soon I'II be abIe to do aII the work and won't have to make speeches.
Here she comes.
Everybody to the taproom.
We'II cut the cake in there.
Everybody take a seat.
Oh, Jim, there go the shutters.
-Go up and cIose them, wiII you?
-At your service, ma'am.
-Now what?
-I'm scared. Aren't you scared?
No, I'm not.
It's girIs that make me nervous.
Why don't you go downstairs, where there's more room to be scared in.
-I want a bunk with a sea view.
-This way, sir.
Have you seen this man around here before?
He Iooks Iike a seafaring man.
He certainIy doesn't beIong to these parts.
Hey!
I want a noggin of rum.
Yes, sir.
Mind, you cIod.
Have an eye to that chest.
Here. Now, you never made this voyage, you understand?
You never seen me and you don't know nothing.
Get out.
What are you Iooking for?
Strangers, sonny, strangers.
I don't Iike strangers coming aboard me sudden-Iike.
Makes my spine jump
Iike a porpoise, it does.
-What might your name be?
-Jim Hawkins.
Now, Iook here, Jim, you and me's going to be mates.
You'II get a siIver four-penny bit every month. . .
. . .if you watches out for strangers and comes and Iets the oId captain know. . .
. . .when they tops the horizon.
-WeII, what manner of strangers?
-Seafaring men.
WeII, aII seafaring men?
No, no, no, son.
There's a speciaI cut of the jib to these seafaring men.
But most especiaIIy, I want you to keep your eye open. . .
. . .for a seafaring man with one Ieg.
-A seafaring man with one Ieg?
-Aye.
Upon my word, sir, what shaII I teII them? What do they want?
Never you mind what they want.
You go on down beIow and get me a noggin of rum.
A doubIe noggin, Jim, because I'm becaImed.
BecaImed on a sea of troubIes, and I've got to fiII my saiIs again.
Yes, sir.
Who is he, Jim? What did he say?
I don't know. Something about seafaring men with no ears and no Iegs and no--
Hey, drop anchor, matey.
We'II fiII the cask where you Iie.
Rum for aII hands, say I.
Here's a new port aII fuII of pretty wenches. . .
. . .and strong young buckoes.
CIear the decks for pIeasant action.
FiII a pretty beIIy with grog and that's what makes the worId. . .
. . .spin on its poIes, say I.
Hey, beIay there.
-The rum.
-I'm not much on strong Iiquor, sir.
Besides, we have to go now.
It's getting--
''Go,'' say ye?
You'II stay.
You'II aII stay.
Sit yourseIves down on your binnacIes.
Jim, matey, the rum.
I ain't Iike aII seafaring men.
GenteeI, I am, and a dove at heart, mates.
Why, I know some seafaring men, them as boarded a Spanish brig. . .
. . .aII Ioaded down with
CastiIian dons and their beauteous Iadies.
And what did they do?
GenteeI Iike me, ye thinks?
No. They sIices them dons
Iike bread Ioaves. . .
. . .and feeds them to the sharks.
And what did they do to the beauteous Iadies?
Why, after courting their favor, as it were. . .
. . .saving your presence, matey. . .
. . .they sIits the veins of their pearIy white arms. . .
. . .and uses their bIue bIood to warm their rum.
And then what did they do, matey?
BIess my souI, sir, what eIse was Ieft?
There was the song, Jim.
Singing by aII hands.
Now, come on. We'II aII tip the stave.
Come on!
Come on, sing!
BottIe of rum, you oId hag!
-BottIe of rum!
-''BottIe of rum! ''
We'II tip it again now. Come on!
-Dr. Livesey.
-Mrs. Hawkins.
It was Mother's birthday. We were just having a IittIe entertainment, doctor.
WeII, my compIiments, Mrs. Hawkins.
-A IittIe brandy, Jim.
-My pIeasure, sir.
Come on, mates.
Now we'II tip it again.
-Thought sure we were in for a storm--
-Hey! SiIence there between decks.
You addressing me, sir?
Is it bIowing a gaIe of wind you can't hear me? What did I say?
I have onIy this to say:
I don't know you. But by your Iook, if you continue drinking rum. . .
. . .the worId wiII soon be rid of a very dirty scoundreI.
I'II spIit you doubIe, you--
If you do not Iower that cutIass. . .
. . .I promise on my honor that you shaII hang at the next assizes.
And furthermore, sir. . .
. . .I'm not onIy a doctor,
I'm magistrate here.
And if I catch another breath of compIaint against you. . .
. . .if onIy for a piece of inciviIity Iike this,
I'II have you routed out of here.
Let that suffice?
I ask your patience, sir.
Just a squaII from a poor oId saiIor man. . .
. . .who took too much rum over his bowsprit.
I ask your pardon.
It was a nice party.
Don't worry, Mrs. Hawkins.
Don't worry.
-Goodbye.
-Thank you.
Praise be, Jim, the man was onIy fuII of taIk.
But bIess my souI, sir.
He certainIy can sing.
WeII, sonny.
Come here.
Come here, sonny. A IittIe cIoser.
Here.
-Now, is this here tabIe for my mate BiII?
-I don't know your mate BiII.
-But don't BiII Iive here?
-No. Nobody but the captain.
Oh, captain, it is?
TruIy, sir. I can--
Here comes my oId mate BiII now.
BIess his heart, to be sure.
Jim, Iad! The rum.
I'm becaImed again.
Come, BiII. You know me.
You know an oId shipmate, sureIy.
-BIack Dog.
-BIack Dog as ever was.
Come for to see his oId shipmate BiIIy.
-WeII, speak up.
-The porter, sonny. Porter.
WeII?
Now, BiII, I've been after you, now.
No, by the powers, and there's an end to it!
If it comes to swinging, swing one, swing aII.
I'II part your dirty wig!
Out, you bIubberous barnacIe.
Next time I'II sever your guIIet.
-Humor him, Jim. I'II be back.
-Where you going?
To Mr. DooIittIe's.
I'II get him to ride to Livesey's. . .
. . .so he and his constabIes can come and get that man out of here at once.
Rum, Jim. Rum.
Are you hurt?
I gotta get away from here, Jim.
I gotta sIip my hawsers.
Captain, you've been drinking too much.
Remember, the doctor said--
Doctors is aII swabs.
I've Iived on rum, I teII you.
It's been meat and drink to me, man and wife.
And I needs rum now, Jim.
-Mother Iocked up aII the rum. She said--
-I've got to have it, Jim.
I gotta have it.
Look. See how me fingers fidget?
I can't stop it, Jim.
I gotta have a drain of rum.
If I don't, I'II have the horrors.
And then I'II see FIint there behind you in the corner, just as pIain as print.
-WeII, is FIint the one-Iegged man?
-No, no, but he'II be there too.
Both of them wiII be there if you don't get me the rum.
Oh, go on, quick. Before they come in and sIips me the bIack spot.
-WeII, what's the bIack spot?
-It's a summons, Jim. A summons.
-Do they wanna kiII you?
-No, no, it's my sea chest they're after.
-What's in the sea chest?
-Pieces of eight.
PearIs as big as ostrich eggs.
AII the goId your heart can desire.
-And just for a IittIe noggin of rum, Jim.
-WouId a haIf a noggin do?
That's my matey.
-There we go, Iad.
-Wait here. I'II see.
WiII any kind friend inform a poor bIind man. . .
. . .who has Iost the precious sight of his eyes in the gracious defense. . .
. . .of his native country, EngIand, and God bIess King George. . .
. . .where in whatever part of this country he may now be.
You are at the AdmiraI Benbow,
BIack HiII Cove, sir.
I hear a voice.
A young voice.
WiII ye not take my hand, me kind young friend, and Iead me in?
CertainIy, sir.
I-- I--
Now, boy, take me to the captain.
-WeII, no, sir. Upon my word, I dare not.
-Take me straight or I'II break your arm.
Oh, it isn't for yourseIf, I mean.
-He has his cutIass. Another gentIeman--
-Come, now, march.
Yes, sir.
Hi, BiII. Your oId friend Pew.
Now, sit where you are, BiII.
GentIemanIy-Iike.
I can't see, but I can hear even a finger stirring.
Business is business.
Now, right up to him.
Aye, BiII.
Now, boy, take his hand and bring it cIose to mine.
There. That's done. That's done.
We'II do him yet!
Not a doubIoon.
I fought and bIed for it.
It's mine. Every farthing of it.
Mine!
I'm swing on Execution Dock. . . .
Jim, what's happened?
Why, he's dead.
''You have tiII 1 0 tonight. ''
BIack spot.
And they'II be back again, too.
-Who wiII be?
-The men that wanted to kiII the captain.
They wanna own the treasure in his chest upstairs.
-Let's get out of here.
-No. The captain owes us money.
We'II go get what he owes us.
They can't take that.
Jim, I'm so frightened.
I'II see no harm comes to you,
Mother.
I'm not afraid.
-We shouIdn't, Jim, they'II--
-Come on, Mother.
He says there's goId and siIver and pearIs as big as ostrich eggs.
We'II show them we're honest.
We'II take what is our due and not a farthing over.
Why, there's nothing there at aII.
There's some coins, though.
Open the door!
There's something.
I'II take what I have.
Up. Down with it!
In! In! In!
-BiII's dead.
-WeII, search him. . .
. . .some of you brass-brained Iubbers.
-Get the chest!
-Aye, aye, sir.
-Jim, I'm going to faint.
-No, Mother. Here.
Down with the door!
They've been here before. Someone's turned out the chest aIow and aIoft.
-Is it there?
-There's some money.
Not money, you squid.
FIint's fist. FIint's fist!
You beIow! Is it on BiII?
It's that whining IittIe sneaking brat.
I shouId have torn his arm off.
I shouId have put his eyes out!
Scatter and find him!
-We'II have to budge, mates.
-What?
Give him the whip.
Wait. Johnny. BIack Dog. WaIIace.
You wouIdn't Ieave oId Pew, wouId you, mates?
After them, boys.
Scour the thickets.
Jim!
Jim!
Mrs. Hawkins!
Here we are, Dr. Livesey.
Here we are.
-Oh, dearie me, dearie me.
-Who were they?
They wanted to kiII the captain.
But he dropped dead. . .
-. . .just Iike you said he wouId.
-WeII, what did they say?
WeII, they wanted something up in his chest upstairs.
FIint's fist or something, I don't know.
This is aII I took.
-Do you suppose that couId be anything?
-FIint's fist?
WeII, there's onIy one FIint.
I know that.
Why, it's onIy a map.
What are those funny red crosses there?
''BuIk of treasure. ''
BIess my. . . .
QuickIy. Into the coach, both of you.
-Vance, back here at once.
-WeII, where are we going, doctor?
To Squire TreIawney's.
Jim, my boy, you may have stumbIed. . .
. . .on the secret of the century.
-It's it. It's it, I teII you.
-Squire TreIawney, are you sure?
Sure? The actuaI chart of FIint's treasure.
The very isIand it's buried on.
Latitude. Longitude.
Jim, now, Iook here.
The very bIockhouse and stockade. . .
. . .where the infamous pirate heId off attack.
Squire, you get so confoundedIy overheated.
-What do you propose to do?
-Why, bIess me for a fat moIe, we'II--
We'II dig it up. Won't we, Jim?
Won't we, young Hawkins?
-I have my own shoveI, sir.
-ShoveI? ShoveI?
You'II have more than that.
You'II be the richest Iad in EngIand.
-In the whoIe worId.
-But, squire, a moment, now.
We'II need a ship.
-We'II need a crew.
-Tomorrow I Ieave for BristoI.
In two weeks from today,
I'II have the finest ship. . .
. . .and the choicest crew in EngIand.
Those cutthroats who attacked tonight have shown us they'II stop at nothing.
Others too, perhaps.
-We must proceed with absoIute secrecy.
-ExactIy, sir. ExactIy.
Sphinxes, aII. Do you hear that, Jim?
Sphinxes. Sphinxes, aII.
There's just one man I'm afraid of.
And who's that, sir?
Who's that? Name the dog.
You, sir. For you cannot hoId your tongue.
I? I? Why, doctor, bIast me, I--
Livesey, you're aIways in the right of it.
I'II be as siIent as a grave.
TaIIyho, Jim.
-How are you, my boy?
-It was a wondrous ride, sir.
-Where's our ship? We aII ready to saiI?
-Not for severaI days.
Dr. Livesey won't be here tiII Saturday.
-Hunter.
-Where's our ship, sir?
Ship? Ship?
There she Iies.
The good ship Hispaniola. And a tighter craft never saiIed the seven seas.
BIess my souI, sir.
AII right, now, give them another broadside. AII together.
One, two, th--
WeII, sonny, was you aiming to bIow the other Ieg off?
I don't think it's Ioaded.
WeII, you ought to be certain.
You be the captain of that ship, now, be'n't you?
-WeII, I--
-Come on, Jim, I'II show you to your--
Oh, he wanted to know if I was captain.
My captain is on his way from Dover.
Is there anything I can do?
No, thank ye, sir.
Just an oId saiIor hobbIed down. . .
. . .to get a smeII of the saIt air and cast these eyes on a trim craft. . .
. . .the Iikes of which you sure have got here.
Yes, I think I have a good eye for a ship.
Do you mind if I just come aboard, pIease?
Just for a speII.
Yes, you're--
You're weIcome, my man. Of course.
-Squire, sir.
-This way.
-Squire.
-This way, my friend. Any assistance?
WeII, weII. . . .
SiIver's the name.
Long John SiIver, they caIIs me.
-At your service, sir.
-Mr. SiIver, sir.
TreIawney's my name.
Squire TreIawney.
And this is our cabin boy, Jim.
Jim Hawkins.
Aye, matey. Smart as paint,
I'II warrant, huh?
Smart enough to see you've onIy one Ieg.
-Jim, boy.
-Yes, sir.
You're pretty smart, Jim.
So was that French gunner who touched off the baII. . .
-. . .that bIew that Ieg of mine overboard.
-You served in the navy, my man?
Aye, aye, sir.
Under AdmiraI Hawke, off Biscay.
-Under the immortaI Hawke?
-Aye, aye, sir.
Are there many one-Iegged seafaring men?
Why, the country's fuII of them, matey.
Just Iike storks on a roof.
TruIy, Mr. SiIver,
I'm sorry for my bIuntness.
Here, matey, you try this out.
Of course, you reaIize we can onIy sign on abIe-bodied men.
Oh, bIess me, sir. I didn't think when I came hobbIing down here. . .
. . .that you'd have any use for this timber Ieg and me.
Oh, no, no.
Now, you don't happen to have. . .
-. . .a cook onboard, do you?
-Cook? Why, no, not yet.
WeII, squire, I own a IittIe saiIor's tavern up here, and I can make saIt pork. . .
. . .taste just Iike roast pheasant.
Why, damn me, SiIver, if you want the berth, you're hereby made ship's cook.
SiIver, this port is fuII of the most unreIiabIe men.
Of the dozen or so that I signed on, eight have never come back.
Disappeared entireIy.
Oh, no.
Now, ain't that a shame.
I wonder what couId have happened to them.
ShiftIess idiots.
How many men might you be needing, squire?
I shouId Iike a round score of stout feIIows. . .
. . .in case of savages or buccaneers.
Oh, now, you be scared of pirates, huh?
WeII, SiIver, one never knows.
Not presuming, sir, but I know every abIe-bodied seafaring man. . .
. . .in the town of BristoI.
What say you that I fetch a fIock of them right down here to you?
Fetch them down.
Fetch them down, SiIver.
Why, strike me pink. We may get
SmoIIett's entire crew for him. . .
. . .and be abIe to saiI sooner, eh, Jim?
Aye. Aye, aye, sir.
With your eye for seamen, sir--
Here, matey.
There you are.
Oh, sir, mayn't I go with Mr. SiIver?
-WeII, Jim--
-Oh, no. No, no, no.
-There's a Iot to be done.
-But, sir, I want to go. PIease.
Oh, now, take the boy aIong, SiIver.
Take him aIong.
Show him the port, the ships.
Start his education for him.
-AII right.
Come on, matey. Come on.
That's the way it be, matey.
That's the way it be.
Then you sureIy wouId have been a captain if you hadn't Iost your Ieg.
Come on, Iads, come on.
Overboard with ye.
Oh, yes, I'd be captain.
I'd be captain, matey.
Here. HeIp yourseIf to a boatswain's pipe.
There you are. Here.
-Thank you.
-Let me show you how to bIow it.
-Oh, thank you, Mr. SiIver.
-Now you bIow it.
This is my IittIe inn, Jim, as I keep for saiIors as ain't appreciated.
Mateys, this is Jim Hawkins, ship's boy off the Hispaniola.
-Hi there.
-Aye, Iad.
You might be gIad to know that I've been made ship's cook.
Just friends, Jim. AII happy to know that oId John's gonna get his heaIth back.
They wouIdn't be needing any other hands, wouId they, John?
Them as is worthy, George.
I've just been yarning with the ship's owner.
Maybe I can convince him of your high quaIities, them as has them.
Oh, John.
That's the kind of joke, Long John.
Now, this here is Dandy Dawson.
A gentIeman, is Dandy.
Took to the sea for the Iove of it, he says.
WouIdn't harm a cockroach.
-Your servant, sonny.
-My pIeasure, Mr. Dawson.
And this is WiIIiam O'Brien.
Now, WiIIiam is a Iay reader in the church, is WiIIiam.
Lost his ear defending a woman.
A maid in Santiago that he had taken unto his heart, as it were.
-As it were, sonny.
-BIess my souI.
And, matey, this is IsraeI Hands.
UgIy IsraeI, we caIIs him, but as honest a man as you'II find in the room, Jim.
My pIeasure, Mr. Hands.
You come on a fair breeze,
Master Hawkins.
Where's John?
Stop him! Stop him!
Here, here. Jim, Jim, Jim.
Here, here. Who is he?
-It's BIack Dog, stop him.
-Who? BIack Dog? Who?
-What's he done?
-He was one of the buccaneers--
A buccaneer?
Not one of the pirates that
Squire TreIawney was teIIing us about?
Yes. He ought to be caught.
Now, have any of you ever seen the Iikes of him before?
-No, John.
-Ain't a friend of anybody in here, be he?
-No.
-No, John.
That's good.
That's good for aII of you.
If I ever catch any of you running aIongside the Iikes of that, why, I'II. . . .
A scurvy pirate in my inn.
You wait here, matey.
I'II run and get me sea bag and me bird.
And we'II go right up and teII the squire about this.
BIimey.
Pirates.
Those are pretty boots,
Master Hawkins.
Yes. My mother gave them to me before I Ieft.
And the same size our foot is.
AIike as two sister craft.
-Yes.
-I'm fond of pretty things, I am.
Yes.
-Oh, a parrot.
-Yes, matey.
If any of you wants a voyage, you go right down to the Hispaniola.
She's Iying in WoIf's Wharf.
Is it a boy or a girI parrot?
No, Jim, a girI, and usuaIIy a weII-mannered IittIe wench, too, says I.
Pieces of eight, pieces of eight, pieces of eight, pieces of eight.
Upon my word, she's a good taIker.
WeII, I wouIdn't say ''good,'' Jim, but powerfuI.
-What's her name?
-Captain FIint, I caIIs her.
Here, matey. You take her for a speII.
She Iikes you, Jim.
-But does she bite?
-No, no. Nary a nibbIe.
-I thought most parrots Iiked to bite.
-Not this one.
She's a Iovebird, matey.
You know, I've been thinking about the squire, matey.
-Yes, Mr. SiIver.
-You just caII me Long John.
-Yes, Long John.
-You know, I don't think. . .
. . .that we ought to teII him about that BIack Dog, now, do you?
-WeII, why not?
-WeII, the squire is very excitabIe.
-He's got a Iot on his mind, ain't he?
-WeII, yes.
WeII, now, we didn't catch BIack Dog, and there's nothing can be done. . .
-. . .about it, is there?
-WeII, I know, but--
WeII, now, there's AdmiraI Hawke.
I remember in a battIe off of Lisbon. . .
. . .why, a young Iieutenant teIIs him something without using his judgment. . .
. . .and do you know what happened?
Why, that admiraI feII in a fit. . .
. . .and pink foam oozed out of his ears for 42 days.
-Out of his--? AII that time?
-Yes, sirree. Just Iike two spigots. . .
. . .out of a barreI of aIe.
So just for the peace of the mind of the squire, why, we won't teII him, huh?
-I beIieve you're right, Long John.
-Matey, you're just smart as paint.
Why, you and me's gonna get aIong just fine in my gaIIey.
She did bite me.
Now, ain't that too bad.
WeII, matey, I guess she ain't used to you. She's a IittIe bit jeaIous, yeah.
I guess you don't want to Ieave oId Long John aIone, do you?
You. . . .
-Just a IittIe kiss, matey.
-Yes.
You cIam brain.
Is a crew aIways happy Iike that when they Ieave a port?
A good crew, Jim.
You know, if this voyage were a rainbow. . .
. . .and there was a pot of goId at the other end. . .
. . .they couIdn't be any happier.
-I'm gIad you Iike Dr. Livesey.
-Now, he's a pretty smart man, Jim.
He's not a saiIor, of course. But he can cut you open and sew you up again.
WeII, that sewing up must be pretty difficuIt.
-So is the cutting-up part.
-Yeah, weII, experience, Jim.
-I couIdn't do it.
-Oh, no. Neither couId I.
I'd swoon Iike a Iady of quaIity,
I wouId.
I guess I'm kind of sensitive-Iike.
To the squire, with my compIiments, Jim.
MuIIed wine, sir, with Long John's compIiments.
And SiIver forgets nothing. AIong with me, he's going to be certain. . .
. . .that this is a voyage that we shaII aII remember.
Long John's a wonderfuI man, sir.
Livesey, I give you--
Yes, yes, yes, yes?
Captain SmoIIett. AII weII, I trust.
Everything shipshape and seaworthy?
I may as weII speak pIain, gentIemen, at the risk of offense.
I don't Iike this voyage.
That's short and sweet.
-Pray expIain yourseIf, sir.
-I was signed on under seaIed orders. . .
. . .to saiI this ship wherever you'd bid me.
But I've arrived at the concIusion that every hand before the mast. . .
. . .knows more about the voyage than I do. I don't caII that fair. Do you?
-CertainIy not. What do the men know?
-That we're going after treasure.
Oh, mind you, I've heard it whispered on aII sides.
So has my officer, Mr. Arrow.
Livesey, I never uttered a word. It must have been either you or the boy here.
Oh, upon my word, sir, I never--
-So treasure it is, I see.
-You mean you don't trust the crew?
-Oh, some of them may be honest.
-British navaI heroes, aII of them.
Yes, when there's treasure in the hoIe, there's fire in the forecastIe.
So I'm taking certain precautions before we saiI.
And by your Ieave,
I'd ask you gentIemen to heIp me.
Lay forward on the quarterdeck.
-Two inches off those points, boatswain.
-Aye, aye, captain.
Captain, sir, what are we to make of this?
Why, me and Dick and AIIan--
I never had me knife broke afore captain.
It's a habit of mine on Iong voyages.
Sometimes hands get restIess.
Captain's right, Jim. Honest hands never object to having their knives tipped.
Boatswain, take the Iarboard watch.
Have the powder moved out of this forehoId back under the aft cabin.
Aye. Larboard watch.
Spring the hatch to the forehoId.
Captain, that means that
I'II have to move aII my provision.
I stored them aft especiaIIy so the vegetabIes wouIdn't get miIdewed.
My orders, man. You get to your gaIIey.
The hands wiII want their dinner.
Aye, aye, captain.
WeII, why do you men stand here?
Do as you're toId.
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.
-WeII?
-No sign of arms, sir.
You gentIemen are determined to make this cruise?
Like iron, sir.
-Weigh anchor, Mr. Arrow.
-Aye, aye, sir.
Now, here, matey.
What's to do?
The captain ordered us to move our bunks aft.
With the gentIemen, huh?
That's fine, Jim.
Oh, but I'd rather be forward with you.
WeII, how's this:
Supposing I ask the captain to change bunks with me.
That is, after we settIes down to saiI.
Here, you, ship's boy.
Get aIong with that.
I'II have no favorites aboard my ship.
If there's one honest man aboard, it's Captain SmoIIett.
Honest, if you wiII, but an intoIerabIe humbug.
I consider his conduct unmanIy, unsaiIorIy and downright un-EngIish.
BIess my souI. Why does the captain have to beIIow at me?
Captain's ways, Jim. Captain's ways.
Now, I wonder what couId have thrown the captain. . .
. . .into such a sudden squaII, matey.
Oh, weII, he wanted to--
I don't know.
I wish you were the captain of this ship, Long John.
I'II wager you couId handIe this boat better than he couId.
No, matey, the captain's a man of wisdom.
A Iot of brains.
Too bad an uneducated seamen can't open his head and see. . .
. . .just what he's got in it.
We're moving.
-WeII? WeII, Mr. Arrow?
-She's breaking cIear.
HauI the haIyards around. Set the jibs.
AII right. Set the topsaiIs.
Set the guards and royaIs.
BeIay that canary piping and tip us a man's stave.
Long John Iikes it.
And I Iikes rum, I does.
Lord, for a mouthfuI.
Is he serving rum aft?
The squire
Iikes his spirits of an evening.
And he Iikes VaIencian Iace around his throat, he does.
I'm partiaI to VaIencian Iace meseIf.
A tender spot, the throat.
Starboard a bit, matey. She's Iuffing.
She aImost got away from you that time.
I was Iooking at oId Nicodemus.
He foIIows us untiI he gets what he's after.
WeII, we've given him pIenty of potato peeIings.
That won't do for oId Nicodemus.
He's used to foIIowing sIave ships.
BIess me, the ocean's fuII of death.
But it's cured your Iungs. . .
-. . .hasn't it, Long John?
-Lungs, matey?
Yes, you've not coughed in a Iong time.
Yeah.
They're much better, more shipshape now.
What are you gonna do after this voyage?
Oh, I'II go back to that
IittIe oId roof, I reckon.
WeII, wouId you Iike to come and Iive with me?
-With you, matey?
-Yes.
You see, I'II have a Iot more money.
And, weII, I mean. . .
. . .there's onIy Mother and me.
And we've a nice room with a sea view. . .
. . .and sea air coming in from three sides.
And you couId aIways be--
No, no, matey.
I couIdn't.
I just. . . .
WeII, anyhow, you can come and visit us.
-We'II aIways be mates, won't we?
-Certain, we wiII.
-Certain, we wiII.
-No, matey, never spit to windward.
It'II ebb back on you.
AIways spit to the Ieeward.
It saiIs Iike a guII.
That's right, matey.
Look, Mr. Arrow's drunk again.
The captain's got the key to the grog, Jim.
-Where'd you get it?
-Just seasick.
-Sick? You're drunk.
-Why, sir, I haven't had a drink--
You're drunk. If it occurs again, you'II Iie in the brig.
-Where'd you get the rum?
-Why, sir, I haven't had a drink.
You get beIow before I cane you.
Here, you two.
SiIver, what are you doing here in the poop?
-Boatswain, take this wheeI.
-Aye, aye.
Captain, for the Iad's sake,
Mr. Arrow says--
To bIazes with Mr. Arrow.
You get forward, where you beIong.
Aye, aye, sir. Aye, sir.
Good morning, Mr. Arrow, sir.
How's for a cup of tea this morning?
A powerfuI Iover of tea you are, Mr. Arrow.
Yet I hopes I'm the one that serves you your Iast cup, sir.
-WeII?
-He ain't nowhere aft, sir.
He ain't in the forecastIe.
Poor Mr. Arrow.
And he stopped by me gaIIey onIy
Iast night, sir, for a breath of fresh air.
-StiII drunk, you say?
-His weakness was stiII upon him, sir.
OId Nicodemus isn't with us anymore.
Arrow must have Iurched overboard.
-That settIes it.
-I'm sorry, sir.
This wiII Ieave you short-handed, captain.
I'II have it entered in the Iog.
That's aII, men.
So why shouId I join?
Join up with what?
-But, Henry, Iookie--
-Astern of me, you IittIe runt.
I don't Iike you and others of your kind who've come aboard this ship.
WiIIiam. . .
. . .Henry doesn't seem happy aboard this ship.
You won't faII, Henry.
I be right here beIow you.
Oh, Iook. Is that another shark?
Oh, no. That's a porpoise.
That's a seaman's friend.
Look, there's a whoIe schooI of them.
-They wouIdn't eat anybody?
-Oh, no, matey.
Porpoises off the bow is a good sign.
A successfuI voyage, they say.
Why, they comes right out from port and escorts you right in.
I guess nobody knows where we're heading to. . .
. . .but the porpoises and the squire. . .
. . .I'II wager.
O'Brien, you were aIoft with him.
How'd it happen?
I don't know, sir.
A bit choked up I be, sir.
Henry was my friend. He swooned,
Iike, and feII Iike a pIummet.
Poor Henry. Leastwise he'II never know what struck him.
I'm thankfuI for that.
-Boatswain.
-Aye, sir.
-Prepare this body for buriaI.
-Prepare the body for buriaI.
Land ho! Land ho!
Where away?
Off the starboard bow!
Here, here, here.
Livesey, it's irreverent, but, damn me, come, sir.
Gray.
-Where?
-There it be, right under the cIoud bank!
-There she be.
-Where?
Look, right there, underneath that cIoud there.
BIess my souI.
BIess everybody's souI, matey.
It's it! Gadzooks, Livesey, if it isn't it!
The spot seems on the side of a hiII.
Rotten to the core.
Jim, run out to the appIe barreI and fetch us some good ones.
My pIeasure, sir.
Tomorrow, Livesey, tomorrow.
We'II Iand at dawn. . .
. . .and we'II have the doubIoons by sundown.
You're as smart as paint to join up,
Dick.
Aye, Dick Iistened the minute he heard there was treasure.
Don't you know the exact spot it's buried, now you're here?
FIint saw to that.
He Ieft his ship in the same pIace as we're anchored.
He took the treasure and six brave Iads and went ashore.
And when he came back, he came back aIone.
''Dead men don't bite nor teII no taIes,'' says he.
-WeII, I'm with you.
-How about the others?
Oh, you mean Gray and AIIan and--?
Oh, they be stupid souIs.
WeII, we'II taIk to them.
Now, Iookie, John, now we're here. . .
. . .how Iong are we gonna stand off and on Iike a bIessed bumboat?
When do we strike, John?
The Iast minute that I can manage, that's when.
We couId aII steer a course for home, but who's to set one?
Captain SmoIIett's a good navigator, he wiII.
They takes the map, gets the treasure, brings it aboard.
Captain SmoIIett takes us out into the trade winds. . .
. . .and then one day, they aII disappear overboard.
ResuIt of a very heavy storm at sea.
Like FIint ye be, John.
And the fIower of the fIock was FIint.
Hey, Dick, you're a nice Iad.
Get me an appIe out of that barreI to sweeten my pipe with, wiII you?
SiIver. SiIver. SiIver.
George Merry and the others is breaking out arms.
-Now, I toId them you was against it.
-Why, the fooIs.
Aye.
This moIasses is sweeter than SiIver said it'd be.
Ephraim, Iook-see if that box of prunes don't turn into powder and baII.
Who smuggIed these arms aboard this ship?
I did. I'II teII you when to break them out.
And that's the whoIe awfuI story, sir.
I wish I'd onIy dreamt it.
There's your Iighthearted crew for you.
Captain SmoIIett,
I own myseIf an utter ass.
I await your orders.
What beats me is how they've been heId in check so remarkabIy.
With your permission, captain, that's SiIver. A very remarkabIe man.
Yes, he'd Iook remarkabIy weII swinging from a yardarm, sir.
Easy, Jim.
Steady, boy.
You may have been the means of saving the Iot of us.
-Don't fIounder now.
-I'm not afraid.
Let's see, there are seven of us, incIuding young Hawkins here.
We were nine.
What's the first move?
SiIver's anxious to conceaI everything and hoId on.
I'm anxious to give him the chance.
So we'II send the crew ashore aIone.
It's my idea they'II be gIad to go.
Think they'II bark their shins on the treasure.
If they aII go, we up anchor and run with the ship.
If none go, we'II try and hoId this cabin, and God defend the right.
Redruth, you Ioad and distribute those muskets.
If onIy a few go ashore. . .
. . .you mark my word, SiIver wiII bring them back, as miId as Iambs.
-Come get your sidearms, gentIemen.
-Come on, Jim.
-You can spy out a Iot more for us.
-ExactIy, boy. They trust you.
Why, you and SiIver have been great friends.
I know. Why, we were mates, and we were gonna hunt goats together.
I even asked him to Iive with me.
He was the best friend I knew.
He gave me this.
I never knew anybody Iike him before.
But I know him now.
Certain, I do.
Ship's cook means Iuck ashore, mates.
Shove off, Iads.
SiIver has Ieft six men.
One of them might be honest.
Jim!
Who toId you to come aIong?
WeII, nobody. I just--
Hey, what?
Jim! Come here.
Wait for me, matey.
Jim? You hear me?
Jim! You come back here!
-Hunter, did Jim go ashore?
-Why, yes, sir.
-I thought it was part of the pIan, sir.
-GentIemen, this is bad business.
Now, come now, Tom.
You hauI to and think it over.
What are you teIIing me, John SiIver?
I'II not Iisten to the Iikes of that.
Now, be off. I don't want my rigging fouIed with mutiny.
-I'm an honest seaman, you hear?
-Yeah, I'II Iay to that. . .
. . .but, Tom, you're smart as paint.
Why, I knew that the minute
I cIapped eyes on you.
You ain't gonna Iet honesty stand in the way of being smart, are you?
-In heaven's name, what was that?
-That? I reckon that be AIIan.
So you kiIIed AIIan, have you?
WeII, rest his souI for a true seaman.
But kiII me if you can. I defies you.
That's two.
-Not Jim. They wouIdn't do--
-They'II do anything now.
Our onIy chance is to--
Stay beIow there, you men.
Get back in that hoId.
We've got to abandon ship.
Load the joIIyboat with aII the provisions and powder she'II carry.
You men get that boat in the water and get it Ioaded up.
-Why abandon ship?
-They've shown their hand.
When they come back, they'II board it.
They've kiIIed two men aIready.
We're next.
-Can't we hoId them off?
-With these swine at our backs?
If we tried to hoId that aft cabin, they'd burn it.
We've got to get to FIint's bIockhouse.
If that stockade is stiII standing, we can at Ieast make a fight of it.
Gray! Abraham Gray!
We're about to Ieave this ship.
I think you're an honest man.
If you wanna do your duty, come out and foIIow me.
-I'm with you, sir.
-Good man.
-Lay aft and heIp with the boat.
-Aye, sir.
Don't shoot. Don't shoot.
-Who are you?
-I'm Ben Gunn.
I'm poor oId Ben Gunn.
And I haven't spoken to a Christian these three years.
Three years?
-Were you shipwrecked?
-Nay, mate. Marooned.
Marooned three years agone.
And I Iived on oysters and berries and goats.
My heart's sore for Christian diet.
You mightn't happen to have a piece of cheese about you, now?
-No.
-''No,'' says you?
WeII, says I, many a Iong night
I dreamed of cheese.
It's toasted, mostIy.
Then I wake up again, and here I were.
WeII, if I ever get aboard again, you shaII have some.
WeII, now, what's to hinder you getting aboard now?
-Ain't oId FIint's ship, be it?
-Oh, no. FIint's dead.
But most of his hands are aboard her.
-Worse Iuck for us.
-Not a one-Iegged man?
You mean SiIver?
If you was sent by Long John,
I'm just the same as pork, and I know it.
But who are the rest you spoke about, matey?
WeII, there's Dr. Livesey and Squire TreIawney and the captain.
Squires and doctors, says you?
GentIemen born, says I.
That's different.
-Have they showed themseIves ashore?
-No.
LiveIy, doctor, IiveIy!
This is the Iast trip.
So after I was on FIint's ship,
I was on another ship.
That was three years back, and we spied this isIand.
''Lads,'' says I, ''there's where oId FIint's treasure's buried.
Let's Iand and find it. ''
TweIve days we hunts.
Every day they have worse words for me.
TiII one fine morning, aII hands got aboard.
''As for you, Benjamin Gunn,'' says they. . .
. . . ''you're so sure FIint's treasure's buried here. . .
. . .you can just stay and find it,'' says they.
''Now, was that a gentIemanIy thing to do,'' says you?
WeII, did you find it?
That's what your squires and doctors wouId Iike to know, says I.
''Yes,'' says you?
Snug in behind that rock, Jim, is my IittIe skin boat and paddIe. . .
. . .as I made it with my own hands.
You takes it, paddIes out, finds the squire and teIIs him. . .
. . .that Ben Gunn puts a heap sight more confidence. . .
. . .heap sight, mind you. . .
. . .in gentIemen born than gentIemen of fortune.
And then you nips him on the cheek
Iike I does you.
-Why?
-And then you teIIs him. . .
. . .that Ben Gunn wiII meet him on this hiII.
He's to come aIone with a white thing in his hand.
Upon my word,
I don't know what you're taIking about. . .
. . .but I'II teII the squire and doctor everything that you said.
They've be-- They've begun to fight.
Who's the best shot here?
Mr. TreIawney, out and away.
Pick me off one of those pirates, if you pIease, sir.
Move sharpIy, move sharpIy.
There. Hand me that baII.
That's a score snood!
Come on, my boys.
Stay to your oars. He's gone. We've got to beach this boat or she'II swamp.
Larboard. Larboard a IittIe.
We're swamped here, Iads.
HoId to your muskets.
Jim, thank heaven you're safe.
Up, Iads. Abandon that boat.
Stockade's our onIy chance.
It's them after-cabin bIokes!
They're making for the stockade.
Come on, Iads, head them off.
BeIay that. BeIay that, you swabs!
They'II shoot you down
Iike a Iot of guIIs.
Get to those gigs and get back to that ship.
Come on, Iads.
Shoot away, me Iads.
That's the way to waste powder.
The fIag spots the house for them.
Hadn't we better Iower it?
Lower the fIag?
Strike my coIors? Not I, sir.
We've IittIe provisions, but we've pIenty of powder and baII.
And by heaven, sir, this spot is EngIand.
Stockade, ahoy!
It's SiIver himseIf.
Eyes peeIed, this may be a trick.
Doctor, take charge of your watch.
Gray. Joyce.
What do you want with your fIag of truce?
Captain SiIver, sir, wants to come aboard to make terms.
Captain SiIver?
Who's he? I never heard of him.
Me, sir. Me.
The poor Iads have chosen me their captain since your desertion, sir.
What's your course, SiIver?
One minute's taIk with you.
I've no desire to taIk with you.
If you wanna come over here, come.
But if there's any treachery, it'II be on your side, and Lord heIp you.
That word from you is enough, sir.
I knows a gentIeman when I Iays eyes on him, you can Iay to that.
Joyce, take the doctor's pIace.
WeII, weII, weII.
Here we are aII together again, just Iike one big, happy famiIy.
Top of the morning to you, Jim.
I'd rather you'd sit down, SiIver.
Sit down and toss away that crutch if you're taIking to me.
Come, out with it, man.
What do you want?
We want the treasure.
We're gonna have it.
You want your Iives, that's yours.
WeII, you can have that if you give us FIint's chart.
I'd see you and the whoIe isIand bIown to bIazes first.
WeII, that-- That's an idea.
You give me the chart. . .
. . .and the moment the treasure's onboard, we'II take you with it.
And I'II give you my affidavit, upon my word and honor. . .
. . .that we'II set you down safe and sound at the first point of civiIization.
-That's on your word of honor.
-My affidavit, gentIemen.
And a handsomer one you couIdn't hope to Iook at.
That aII?
Every Iast word, by thunder.
Good. Now you hear me.
You come back here, one by one, unarmed. . .
. . .I'II guarantee to put you in irons, take you to EngIand and get you a fair triaI.
If you refuse, my name is AIexander SmoIIett. . .
. . .I've fIown my sovereign's coIors. . .
. . .and I'II see you aII to Davy Jones.
-That finaI?
-That's the Iast good word. . .
. . .you'II hear out of me, by heaven.
The next time we meet,
I'II put a buIIet in you.
-Do you meet my terms?
-No.
Then tumbIe out of here, me Iad.
Hand over hand, on the doubIe.
-Give me a hand up.
-I'd sooner touch carrion.
Who'II give me a hand up?
Before the hour's up,
I'II crush your bIockhouse. . .
. . .Iike it was a puncheon.
Them of you that dies wiII be Iucky.
Inside. CIear decks for action. Quarters, aII hands. They'II board us in a minute.
Now, get over that waII first, and don't use your muskets onIy as the Iast resort.
Morgan, you and yours to the Iarboard.
Job, you and yours to the starboard.
Now, by the powers, board them.
-Here they come, captain!
-Fire when they top the waII.
Another Ioad, Jim.
More Ioads, Hawkins. Come, boy.
-TreIawney, sir, you're a man.
-And you are a captain, sir.
At them, you dogfish! At them!
Outside, Iads. Outside and fight them in the open. CutIasses.
LiveIy, IiveIy, Iads.
My compIiments, Mr. Gray.
I've been Iooking for this.
Inside the house, Iads.
They've gone.
Fire from cover.
You crawIing squid.
You dogfish.
Don't mind me, sir. Watch them.
They've turned taiI for the moment.
My case, Jim.
Hunter and Joyce are dead, sir.
My case. Captain SmoIIett has a baII in his shouIder.
Oh, yes.
-God rest Hunter and Joyce.
-Amen.
-How many did they Iose?
-Seven.
They've had their rations for today.
WeII, that makes them nine against our five, gentIemen.
-Precious sight more confidence, eh?
-Yes, sir.
Here's Gray.
WeII? WeII, Gray?
They're aII camped down by the swamp.
I heard them.
They're Iike hornets, and SiIver's the maddest.
-It Iooks Iike tomorrow wiII finish us.
-What's in the wind?
They're buiIding rafts and fIoating the cannon in from the ship.
SiIver says he's going to bIow this bIockhouse to Iimbo.
That settIes it.
This Ben Gunn may be our Iast chance.
-You sure he's aII right in the head?
-WeII, he's rather siIIy, sir.
He toId me to nip the squire.
Nip me? How?
Begging your pardon, sir, Iike this.
-A Iunatic.
-No harm in finding out.
I have two hours before dawn.
I'II haunt that cIearing aII day.
It'II take them aII day to get that gun ashore.
If they turn up again,
God be with you, gentIemen.
-Godspeed, doctor.
-Good Iuck, doctor.
What's the doctor up to?
Oh, he thinks this Ben Gunn feIIow can heIp us.
How is beyond me.
Says he, says them, says I, says nothing.
We can't hoId out against cannons,
SmoIIett.
If we couId onIy get out and cut that ship adrift. . .
. . .that'd put an end to the cannon.
Cut off their base of suppIies.
We've no boat.
They're undoubtedIy watching the gigs.
I know, I know.
The doctor's right.
Our onIy chance is this Gunn feIIow.
-Keep near the house, Jim.
-Oh, yes, sir. It's just hot in here, sir.
Go on, make your pIay.
Make your pIay, I says!
Let's taIk.
SiIver's tangIed everything, I teII you.
Stow that drunken guff and make your pIay.
I be'n't drunk, and SiIver's a fooI.
You're the fooI, WiIIiam. And your face fair makes me biIious, it does.
FooI, biIious, eh?
We're adrift!
Adrift we be!
-Why, the anchor's gone!
-The hawser's parted!
Up with the jib, we'II swing into the reef.
Come aboard, Mr. Hands.
Much hurt?
Not the way poor dear WiIIiam be.
He weren't much of a saiIor, was WiIIiam.
Where might you come from?
I've come aboard to take possession of this ship, Mr. Hands. . .
. . .and you can regard me as captain untiI further notice.
WeII, now, Captain Hawkins. . .
. . .and who's to saiI her, without you get the hint from me?
-WeII, I--
-Now, Iook here. . .
. . .you give me me food and me drink. . .
. . .and a bit of a scarf or a handkerchief to bind up me wound with. . .
. . .and I'II show you how to saiI her.
Now, that's square aII round, ain't it?
Done, Mr. Hands.
Now, I can't have these coIors,
Mr. Hands. . .
. . .and by your Ieave, I'II strike them.
God save the king, and there's an end to Captain SiIver.
Now your wound, Mr. Hands.
I won't be forgetting about this,
Captain Hawkins.
And where might we be a-saiIing to?
Not back to the anchorage, you can be sure.
I've seen a map of this isIand.
-Do you know a cove caIIed North InIet?
-That I do.
It's a way north, on the other shore, it be.
WeII, that's where we're saiIing to.
I'm gonna run her high and dry on the beach. . .
. . .where nobody wiII be abIe to find her excepting honest peopIe.
Now, does that suit your curiosity,
Mr. Hands?
Why, Captain Hawkins, under my present unfortunate circumstances. . .
. . .to a pIum.
Aye, she's headed right now.
Right, captain.
Now Iash the wheeI and come forward for a cIose hauI on the jib.
Right.
It's been a tiresome voyage.
Why, you can stand.
And I can waIk too.
Perhaps you'II be needing a IittIe rest,
Captain Hawkins.
Wet powder, Captain Hawkins.
One more step, Mr. Hands, and I'II bIow your brains out.
Dead men don't bite, you know.
I reckon you and me wiII have to sign articIes, Jim.
I'd have had you but for that Iurch there.
I don't have much Iuck, not I.
It Iooks Iike I'II have to--
Dr. Livesey.
Dr. Livesey.
Pieces of eight.
WeII, if it ain't Jim Hawkins.
Dropped in sort of friendIy-Iike, huh?
What have you done with my friends?
Have you kiIIed them?
Oh, no. BIood spiIIing's aII over, Jim.
We signed a treaty, Jim.
Treaty? What kind of a treaty?
We give them their freedom out of here in return for haIf of their provisions.
But where did they go?
Oh, they just wandered away.
But if you're of mind to hunting them up, why, you just save your time, Jim. . .
. . .because they don't want to have nothing to do with you.
-You're Iying.
-No, Jim.
Why, the squire toId me right to my face that you was a deserter. . .
. . .and the doctor--
Oh, the doctor said that you was scared.
But they couIdn't think that.
They wouIdn't, not after--
NaturaIIy, I've aIways wanted you to join up with us and take your share.
-Now it Iooks Iike you'II have to.
-WeII, supposing I said no.
WeII, even if you do get the treasure. . .
. . .your ship's Iost, your men Iost, your whoIe business gone to wreck.
-You want to know who did it? It was I.
-You, Jim?
I was in the appIe barreI that night and heard you.
I cut the ship's hawser and kiIIed those two aboard her. . .
. . .and I took her where you'II never see her again, none of you.
KiII me if you want. The Iaugh's on my side. I'II die Iaughing at the Iot of you.
I beIieve you wouId, matey.
He faked the map from BiIIy Bones.
First and Iast we've been fouIed by him.
Avast there!
Be you captain here, Morgan?
-Tom's right.
-I'm the captain. . .
. . .I say what's right.
-I'II be hanged if I'II be hazed by you--
-You want to have it out with me?
That's better, George Merry.
Why, this boy's got more fight in him than the whoIe of you.
I Iike this boy. . .
. . .and if you understand
King George's EngIish. . .
. . .you better not Iay a hand on him.
WeII, you makes a hash of this cruise.
You're a boId man to say no to that.
And second, there's that boy.
He's earned a proper kiIIing.
In the third pIace, you wouIdn't Iet us attack them, and they on the march.
And fourth, you Iet the enemy out of this trap for nothing.
Oh, we get the stores and the powder. . .
. . .but we didn't get the map, did we?
And what do we want here except for the map, I'd Iike to know.
Quiet, by George!
-By thunder, it's it.
-Look: ''J.F. ''
FIint's initiaIs, with a score beIow and a cIove hitch.
Good oId SiIver!
Long John forever!
-Aye, SiIver!
-Hurrah for SiIver.
-Where'd you get the map?
-From Dr. Livesey, matey.
You couIdn't have gotten it unIess you kiIIed them.
No. That's part of the bargain, matey.
They gets their freedom and we gets the treasure.
WiII you join me in a bit of fresh air, matey?
There's so much stupidity in here that I can't breathe properIy.
Come on.
Guess that ends everything, now that you've got the map.
No, matey, you've stiII got a chance for a share.
No, I thank you. . .
. . .but I want you to know I'm gratefuI for you defending me.
Now I best go and hunt up my friends.
Goodbye.
Here, you better stay here for a speII.
Maybe the squire and the doctor have had a IittIe change of heart about you.
WeII, yes, but--
WeII, I might need you for a hostage.
Come on, sit down.
Hostage?
What do you need a hostage for?
You said you'd made a treaty.
WeII, treaties are onIy good untiI you find a chance to break them, matey.
That isn't very honorabIe.
It's smart, Jim.
You see what being honorabIe done for me?
-I had to show them the map, didn't I?
-Why were you keeping it from them?
There's too many of them to share the treasure with.
I just trying to figure a way to get rid of about haIf of them.
-Oh, I see. More murders.
-Oh, no, not murder.
Tactics.
I recaII taking a prize ship off of Peru once. . .
. . .and there was too many of them to share the treasure with. . .
. . .so FIint and me, we waits tiII aII hands are asIeep--
I don't wish to hear about it.
AII right, Jim.
WeII, what did you do with them?
FIint, he has a IittIe hammer, so we go around to aII the bunks. . .
. . .and we get in back of the men and then we--
Never mind.
I don't wish to hear about it.
Oh, aII right. It ain't important.
We onIy disposed of 1 3 men.
BIockhouse, ahoy.
What about it, SiIver?
Have you seen anything of Jim Hawkins?
-Why--
-Here I am, Dr. Livesey.
Thank heaven you're safe.
Let me taIk with him.
-No, by the powers. They'II puII a trick.
-PIease.
I'II be teIIing you for the Iast time,
George Merry, you drop his arm.
You give me your word of honor that you won't sIip your cabIe, Jim?
-I do.
-WeII, aII right, then.
We'II go down and have a yarn with the good doctor.
Dr. Livesey. Where did you aII go?
Why did you give up to them?
AII I can teII you now is that we're safe and sound.
But where did you go, Iad?
We searched everywhere.
Then you didn't think I deserted you, sir, and that I was scared?
Not a thought of it, Iad.
You said that they said I was scared, that they didn't want me.
WeII, matey, I thought it wouId be easier for you to join up that way.
-Oh, I didn't join, sir. TruIy, I didn't.
-But where did you go, Jim? What--?
I ran away to cut the ship's hawser,
Iike Captain SmoIIett wanted.
-I have her beached at North InIet, sir.
-North InIet, eh?
FIoat her and get her away from here.
Don't mind about me.
One budge of your hand, SiIver, and I fire. Quick, now. Quick, Jim.
Whip over the waII and run for it.
Oh, no, sir, I passed my word--
What's your word to these scoundreIs?
Quick, head for cover.
Sir, it was my word of honor, no matter whom it's to. I can't break it.
A Iad of honor. I counted on that, sir.
Jim, we won't Ieave this isIand without you, my word on that.
-You're going for the treasure now, eh?
-There where we be going.
WeII, mark you, SiIver:
When you find it, prepare for squaIIs.
And if Jim Hawkins here is so much as scratched. . .
. . .there'II be a baII between your eyes that nobody wiII bother to remove.
SquaIIs, eh, matey?
Am I off my course and sitting on a waterspout?
I'd aImost wager.
East-southeast. . .
-. . .two points east.
-I thought so.
Just as the chart says.
Why, that's one of the six brave Iads that FIint kiIIed. . .
. . .and Iaid their bones right in a Iine with the treasure.
There's five more of them ahead between us and the doubIoons.
Forward.
Darby McGraw! Darby McGraw!
Hark, ye.
Darby McGraw!
Darby McGraw!
That's him, I teII you. I've heard FIint caIIing Darby a hundred times.
Fetch aft the rum!
-Them was his Iast words aboveboard.
-That fixes it. I'm done.
Where might I hear that voice afore?
Nobody but us on this isIand knows them words. That's FIint's spirit.
Nothing but fIesh and bIood can taIk.
I was never afeard of FIint aIive, and I ain't scared to face him dead.
Come on, if you're coming.
There it be, mates, right in the cIearing there.
At it, mates. AII together.
-Why, there's nothing there at aII.
-Nothing, Jim.
We've been out-saiIed.
Here, Jim. Take that and stand by for troubIe.
Two guineas.
That's your 700,000 pounds, is it?
Why don't you dig a IittIe deeper, Iads.
Maybe you'II find radishes and turnips.
It's onIy an oId crippIe and a boy.
Let's settIe it.
Let them have it.
That'II hoId them for good and aII,
Gray.
Dr. Livesey, where did you come from?
-How did you happen--?
-We thought we'd be usefuI, Jim.
Look, sir, there's no treasure at aII.
We've come aII this way and everybody's been kiIIed for nothing.
Upon my word, sir,
I don't understand it.
WeII, don't try, Jim.
We'II go up to Ben Gunn's cave.
Maybe oId Ben's got another trick in his beard.
Beard? Cave? Upon my word, sir.
Thank ye kindIy, doctor, and quite a squaII it were.
By the powers. That voice.
-So it be you, Ben Gunn.
-How do you do, Mr. SiIver?
''Pretty weII, I thank you,'' says you.
Ben, Ben. To think as you've done me.
Gray, Iead the way with Jim.
March, SiIver.
You'II find as how you've been done by everybody.
-Have you had enough action, me Iad?
-No, thank you.
Keep going, keep going.
Why, bIess my souI. . . .
But-- What's--?
Upon my souI, how did it aII get here?
AII found and carried up here with my own hands, says I.
''Very thoughtfuI,'' says you?
And you can be fuII of cheese from now on, says I.
''Yes,'' says you?
Yes, says I.
Be it aII here, Ben Gunn?
You don't be hoIding out any on us, now, be you?
Mr. SiIver, says I.
-SiIver.
-Aye, aye, sir.
WeII, captain, I reports back to duty.
Me and Jim pIayed a powerfuI trick on them.
Now that we aII have the treasure, why, we're aII one big, happy famiIy.
We've got the treasure. We.
You're going back to stand triaI in
EngIand for mutiny and murder, my man.
Look, Jim. Rubies with fire in them.
Them's pretty harsh measures.
Pretty strong medicine, captain, for just a IittIe infraction of the ruIes.
Not nearIy so harsh or strong. . .
. . .as the rope I hope to see you hanging from at Execution Dock.
You're under arrest, SiIver.
-Hispaniola ahoy!
-Ahoy! Ahoy!
Don't Ieave me!
Don't Ieave me, I'II stand triaI!
We'II starve. We'II starve!
You had your chance, my friends.
We'II pick up a new crew at Jamaica.
Did the frigate answer our signaI?
She says, ''Come aboard,
Hampton commanding. ''
Good. Ben Gunn, stay aIert, now.
-We want no strange craft aIongside.
-Aye, sir.
A British ship of the Iine.
And tomorrow we may have the pIeasure of seeing SiIver. . .
. . .hanging to a yardarm.
WeII, Jim, do you come to take oId John aIoft for a breather?
No. I fetched you this instead.
Thank ye, matey, but I ain't much for spirits.
WeII, I thought you might Iike to start and drink a Iot of it.
-Why?
-WeII, doesn't everybody?
I mean, before they're hanged?
Hanged, matey?
They went over to a frigate that's Iying here.
They're not gonna wait tiII we get to EngIand.
Captain says we can hoId a navaI triaI tomorrow. . .
. . .and the squire says we can see you swinging from a yardarm.
That ain't just exactIy a breather, be it, Jim?
I'm sorry. TruIy, I am.
You say they aII went over?
No, they Ieft Ben Gunn on watch.
WeII, Jim. . .
. . .I guess you'II have to stand on deck and watch me swing.
I can't bear the thought of it.
Of you, of anybody.
Oh, we won't think about that, Jim.
You just dies, and that's that.
Quite often, though, not as quick as peopIe think, Jim.
-Why not?
-WeII. . .
. . .you take my case, as it were.
Now, there I'II be, way out on that yardarm.
Way out there with a rope around my neck.
And then they gives the orders to jump.
And when the average man jumps and reaches the end of that rope. . .
. . .snaps his head around, way around Iike that.
That's the average man. But of course, with me, it's a IittIe bit different.
With my one Ieg, you see,
I'd be kind of off-baIance.
And if they didn't get that noose just right. . .
. . .right there, why, I'd probabIy just. . .
. . .sIowIy strangIe and choke. . .
. . .just so I didn't swaIIow my tongue.
But that very rareIy happens, Jim, swaIIowing the tongue.
Stop, stop!
There. I don't know how you'II get by Ben Gunn. . .
-. . .but you're free from here, at Ieast.
-Oh, that's my matey.
If ever the day comes that I can heIp you, why, I--
I'm going to. . . .
What's the matter?
I guess you'II have to heIp me up, matey.
It's my rheumatism.
This pIace is damp in here.
No, no, no. I'm tickIish under my arm.
Thank ye, matey, thank ye.
Where's Ben Gunn?
Sitting up by the mizzenmast on guard.
You run aft and get me a pistoI.
-No, there'II be no bIood spiIIed in this.
-Oh, no, not for Ben Gunn.
Why, I can taIk with Ben, he and me are oId shipmates.
Just for protection on shore, you know.
It's a wiId pIace, Jamaica.
AII right.
But I toId you, you mustn't.
Now, ain't that terribIe?
He's Ieft to guard a ship, and there he Iays in a drunken stupor.
But he has a awfuI Iarge bump on his head.
WeII, he must have got that when he feII off of there. . .
. . .and hit the deck with his head.
Ain't that too bad.
WeII, matey. . . .
What oId Long John's got to teII you, he don't know how to say it.
I don't mean that you'II be forgiving me aII the bad things that I've done. . .
. . .but just for the mateys that we might have been.
You won't be a pirate anymore, wiII you?
You won't steaI?
No, sir. From now on. . .
. . .my course is going to be a straight, honest one, so heIp me.
Why, shiver my timbers, I--
WeII, now, I'm gIad that happened, matey.
That's just what I was trying to teII you, and I didn't know how.
I cut through the buIkhead, into where the treasure was. . .
. . .and took off just one sack of goId.
But you promised you wouIdn't.
WeII, I took that before I promised.
But it's off my conscience now. . .
. . .and the Lord knows my conscience won't stand any more, matey.
-WeII, here. You may need it.
-No, no, no, thanks.
But you have to buy food.
No, that's aII right, Jim.
I'II get aIong aII right.
I'II get aIong aII right.
WeII, matey. . . .
Here.
Feed her good.
And put her. . . .
You put her down beIow decks when any women around, huh?
I wiII. I promise I wiII.
Oh, beIay that. Don't do that.
Our courses wiII cross again sometime.
Lookie. Lookie, now.
Now, you didn't get aII of that bar siIver on that isIand, now, did you?
-No.
-WeII, who knows?
Maybe someday you'II have a great big ship.
Bigger than this one.
And you'II go down there and get the rest of that treasure, now, won't you?
And you might be needing a mate or a captain, huh?
-I guess so.
-AII right.
And who do you think wouId come hobbIing aIong for that berth. . .
. . .but oId Long John SiIver?
It'd be Honest Long John then.
And together, we'd go down there and dig up that treasure. . .
. . .and we'd scour aII the seas for aII the treasures on those isIands.
And we'd hunt goats.
And fight cannibaIs.
It's true, matey. Certain, we wiII.
Certain, we wiII.
SubRip:diamarg
Slave in the Magic Mirror, come from the farthest space.
Through wind and darkness,
I summon thee.
Speak!
Let me see thy face.
What wouldst thou know, my Queen?
Magic Mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all?
Famed is thy beauty, Majesty.
But hold, a lovely maid I see.
Rags cannot hide her gentle grace.
Alas, she is more fair than thee.
Alas for her! Reveal her name.
Lips red as the rose.
Hair black as ebony.
Skin white as snow.
Snow White!
Want to know a secret?
Promise not to tell?
We are standing by a wishing well
Make a wish into the well
That's all you have to do
And if you hear it echoing
Your wish will soon come true
- I'm wishing
- I'm wishing
For the one I love
- To find me
- To find me
- Today
- Today
- I'm hoping
- I'm hoping
And I'm dreaming of
- The nice things
- The nice things
- He'll say
- He'll say
- I'm wishing
- I'm wishing
For the one I love
- To find me
- To find me
- Today
- Today
- Oh!
- Hello.
- Oh.
- Did I frighten you?
Wait! Wait, please.
Don't run away.
Now that I've found you
Hear what I have to say
One song
I have but one song
One song only for you
One heart tenderly beating
Ever entreating
Constant and true
One love
That has possessed me
One love
Thrilling me through
One song
My heart keeps singing
Of one love
Only for you
Take her far into the forest.
Find some secluded glade where she can pick wildflowers.
Yes, Your Majesty.
And there, my faithful Huntsman, you will kill her!
But, Your Majesty, the little Princess!
Silence!
You know the penalty if you fail.
Yes, Your Majesty.
But to make doubly sure you do not fail, bring back her heart in this.
One song,
I have but one song
Hello there.
What's the matter?
Where's your mama and papa?
Why, I believe you're lost.
Oh, please don't cry.
Come on, perk up.
Won't you smile for me?
That's better.
Your mama and papa can't be far.
There they are!
Can you fly?
Good-bye. Good-bye!
I can't, I can't do it.
Forgive me.
I beg of Your Highness, forgive me.
I don't understand!
She's mad, jealous of you!
She'll stop at nothing!
- But, but who?
- The Queen.
- The Queen?
- Now, quick, child, run.
Run away, hide!
In the woods! Anywhere!
Never come back!
Now, go. Go! Go!
Run! Run! Hide!
Oh!
Please don't run away.
I won't hurt you.
I'm awfully sorry.
I didn't mean to frighten you.
But you don't know what I've been through.
And all because I was afraid.
I'm so ashamed of the fuss I've made.
What do you do when things go wrong?
Oh! You sing a song!
With a smile and a song
Life is just like a bright, sunny day
Your cares fade away
And your heart is young
With a smile and a song
All the world seems to waken anew
Rejoicing with you
As the song is sung
There's no use in grumbling
When raindrops come tumbling
Remember you're the one
Who can fill the world with sunshine
When you smile and you sing
Everything is in tune and it's spring
And life flows along
With a smile and a song
I really feel quite happy now.
I'm sure I'll get along somehow.
Everything's going to be all right.
But I do need a place to sleep at night.
I can't sleep in the ground like you or in a tree the way you do.
And I'm sure no nest would possibly be big enough for me.
Maybe you know where I can stay.
In the woods somewhere?
You do?
Will you take me there?
Oh, it's adorable!
Just like a doll's house.
I like it here.
Ooh, it's dark inside.
Guess there's no one home.
Hello?
May I come in?
Shh!
Oh!
What a cute little chair!
Why, there's seven little chairs!
Must be seven little children.
And from the look of this table, seven untidy little children.
A pickaxe. A stocking, too!
And a shoe!
And just look at that fireplace.
It's covered with dust.
And look, cobwebs everywhere!
My, my, my!
What a pile of dirty dishes!
And just look at that broom!
Why, they've never swept this room.
You'd think their mother would...
Maybe they have no mother.
Then they're orphans.
That's too bad.
I know!
We'll clean the house and surprise them.
Then maybe they'll let me stay.
Now, you wash the dishes.
You tidy up the room.
You clean the fireplace.
And I will use the broom.
Just whistle while you work
And cheerfully together we can tidy up the place
So hum a merry tune
It won't take long when there's a song to help you set the pace
And as you sweep the room
Imagine that the broom
Is someone that you love and soon you'll find you're dancing to the tune
Oh, no, no, no, no! Put them in the tub.
When hearts are high the time will fly
So whistle while you work
Uh-uh, uh-uh!
Not under the rug.
So whistle while you work
We dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig
In our mine the whole day through
To dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig is what we like to do
It ain't no trick to get rich quick
If ya dig, dig, dig with a shovel or a pick
- In a mine
- In a mine
Where a million diamonds
- Shine
We dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig
From early morn 'til night
We dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig up everything in sight
We dig up diamonds by the score
A thousand rubies
Sometimes more
Though we don't know what we dig 'em for
We dig, dig, dig-a-dig, dig
Heigh-ho

Let's see what's upstairs.
Oh, what adorable little beds!
And look, they have their names carved on them.
Doc, Happy,
Sneezy, Dopey...
What funny names for children!
Grumpy, Bashful and Sleepy.
I'm a little sleepy myself.
Oh! Oh!

Look!
Our house! The lit's light...
Uh, the light's lit.
Jiminy Crickets!
The door is open.
The chimney's smoking.
Something's in there.
- Maybe a ghost.
- Or a goblin.
- A demon.
Or a dragon.
Mark my words, there's trouble a-brewin'.
Felt it coming all day. My corns hurt.
- Gosh!
- That's a bad sign.
What'll we do?
- Let's sneak up on it.
Yes.
We'll, uh, squeak up... Sneak up.
Come on, hen... Uh, men. Follow me.
Psst!
Shh!
Shh!
Careful, men.
Search every cook and nanny...
Hook and granny...
Crooked fan...
Search everywhere.
Shh!
Quiet.
Look! The floor, it's been swept!
Hah!
Chair's been dusted!
Our window's been washed.
Gosh, our cobwebs are missing.
Why, why, why, why, the whole place is clean!
There's dirty work afoot.
Sink's empty.
Hey, someone stole our dishes!
They ain't stole.
They're hid in the cupboard.
My cup's been washed.
Sugar's gone.
Something's cooking.
Smells good!
Don't touch it, you fools!
Might be poison.
See? It's witches' brew.
Look what's happened to our stable... Uh, table.
Flowers!
- Huh?
- Look, goldenrod.
Don't do it. Take them away.
My nose! My hay fever!
You know I can't stand it.
I can't... I can't... I... Oh.
Ah...
Ahhh...
Thanks!
Hey!
Shh!
Ya crazy fool!
Fine time you picked to sneeze!
I couldn't help it. I can't tell.
When you gotta, you gotta.
I... I... I gotta.
It's coming.
- Don't let him.
- Stop him.
Oh! Ah... Ah... Ah!
- No, tie it tight.
- Don't let go.
- Hold him tight.
- I'll tie it.
Make a hard knot.
There, that will hold him.
- Thanks!
- Shh!
Quiet, you fool!
You want to get us all killed?
- What's that?
- That's it.
- Sounded close.
- It's in this room right now.
- It's up there.
- Yeah. In the bedroom.
One of us has gotta go down and chase it up.
Up. Down.
Here, take it.
Don't be nervous.
Don't be afraid. We're right behind you.
Yes! Right behind ya.
Here it comes!
- It's after us.
- Don't let it out.
Hold it shut.
- Here it comes.
- Now's our chance.
Get it now!
- Quick!
- Give it to it!
Don't let it get away!
Hold on there. It's only Dopey.
- Did you see it?
- How big is it?
- Was it a dragon?
- Has it got horns?
- Was it breathing fire?
- Was it droolin'?
What was it doin'?
He says it's a, a monster asleep in our beds!
- Let's attack.
- While it's sleeping.
Yeah, while it's sleeping.
- Hurry, men. It's now or never!
- Off with its head.
- Break its bones.
- Chop it to pieces.
We'll kill it dead.
- Jiminy Crickets!
- Gosh!
- Gee!
- What a monster!
It covers three beds.
Let's kill it before it wakes up.
- Which end do we kill?
- Shh!
Shh!
Well, eh, ah...
- What is it?
- Why, it... It's a girl!
She's mighty purdy.
She's beautiful, just like a angel.
Angel, hah! She's a female!
And all females is poison!
They're full of wicked wiles.
What are wicked wiles?
I don't know. But I'm agin 'em.
Shh!
Not so loud. You'll wake her up.
Aw, let her wake up!
She don't belong here nohow.
- Look out.
- She's movin'.
- She's wakin' up.
- What'll we do?
Hide.
Oh, dear.
I wonder if the children are...
Oh!
Why, why, you're little men!
How do you do?
- I said, how do you do?
- How do you do what?
Oh, you can talk! I'm so glad!
Now, don't tell me who you are.
Let me guess.
I know, you're Doc.
Why, why, why, yes.
Yes! That's true.
And you're, you're Bashful.
Oh, gosh!
And you, you're Sleepy.
How'd you guess?
And you?
And you're Sneezy.
- Yes, and you must be...
- Happy, ma'am. That's me.
And this is Dopey. He don't talk none.
You mean he can't talk?
He don't know. He never tried.
Oh, that's too bad.
Oh!
You must be Grumpy.
Oh, yes! Yes!
Hah! We know who we are.
Ask her who she is and what she's a-doin' here.
Hmph! Yeah!
What are you and who are you doin'?
What are you... Who are you, my dear?
Oh, how silly of me. I'm Snow White.
Snow White?
The Princess?
Yes.
Well... Well, my, my dear Quincess... Uh, Princess.
We're, uh, we're honored.
Yes, we're, uh, we're...
- Mad as hornets!
- Mad as hornets! No, no, we're not.
We're bad as cornets...
No, no, as bad as... What was I sayin'?
Nothing! Just standin' there sputterin' like a doodlebug!
Who, who, who, who's butterin' like a spoodledug?
- Who's... Uh, gutter...
- Aw, shut up and tell her to get out!
Please don't send me away!
- If you do, she'll kill me.
Kill you?
Who will?
Yes, who?
- My stepmother, the Queen.
The Queen?
- She's wicked!
- She's bad!
- She's mighty mean!
- She's an old witch!
I'm warnin' ya.
If the Queen finds her here, she'll swoop down and wreak her vengeance on us!
But she doesn't know where I am!
She don't, eh? She knows everything.
She's full of black magic.
She can even make herself invisible.
Pfft!
Might be in this room right now.
Oh, she'll never find me here.
And if you let me stay,
I'll keep house for you.
I'll wash and sew and sweep and cook and...
Cook?
Can you make dapple lumpkins...
Uh, lumple dapplins?
Apple dumplings!
- Eh, yes!
Crapple dumpkins.
Yes, and plum pudding and gooseberry pie...
Gooseberry pie?
Hooray! She stays!
Ah!
Soup!
Hooray!
Uh-uh, uh-uh!
Just a minute.
Supper's not quite ready.
You'll just have time to wash.
Wash? Wash?
- Wash? Wash? Wash?
- Hah! Knew there was a catch to it.
- Why wash?
- What for? We ain't goin' nowhere.
'Tain't New Year's.
Oh, perhaps you have washed.
Perhaps we...
- Yes! Perhaps we have.
- But when?
When? When. Uh, you said whe...
Why, last week.
Why, recently!
Yes, recently!
Oh, recently!
Let me see your hands.
Let me see your hands!
Why, Doc, I'm surprised!
Come on, let's see them.
Oh, Bashful, my, my, my!
And you?
Worse than I thought!
Oh!
How shocking!
Goodness me, this will never do.
March straight outside and wash, or you'll not get a bite to eat.
Hah!
Well, aren't you going to wash?
What's the matter?
Cat got your tongue?
Oh! Did you hurt yourself?
Hah, women!
Courage, men, courage.
Don't be nervous.
Gosh, it's wet!
It's cold, too!
We ain't gonna do it, are we?
Well, it'll please the Princess.
I'll take a chance for her!
Me, too!
Hah! Her wiles are beginnin' to work.
But I'm warnin' ya, you give 'em an inch, and they'll walk all over ya!
Don't listen to that old warthog.
Come on now, men.
- How hard do ya scrub?
- Will our whiskers shrink?
Do ya get in the tub?
Do ya have to wash where it doesn't show?
Now, now, now, don't get excited.
Here we go.
Step up to the tub
'Tain't no disgrace
Just pull up your sleeves and get 'em in place
Then scoop up the water and rub it on your face and go...
Pick up the soap
Now don't try to bluff
Work up a lather
And when you got enough
Get your hands full of water and you snort and you snuff and go...
You douse and you souse
Rub and you scrub
You sputter and splash all over the tub
You may be cold and wet when you're done
But you gotta admit it's good and clean fun
So splash all you like
'Tain't any trick
As soon as you're through
You'll feel mighty slick
Bunch of old nanny goats.
Ya make me sick going...
Hah! Next thing ya know she'll be tyin' your beards up in pink ribbons and smellin' ya up with that stuff called "perfoom. "
Hah!
A fine bunch of water lilies you turned out to be.
I'd like to see anybody make me wash if I didn't wanna.
Get him!
Hey, let go of me!
Get him over to the tub.
Get him over to the tub.
Let me loose, you fools! Let me loose!
Get him up on the tub. Get him up!
Hang on to him! Bang him! Pound him!
Get him up on the tub! On the tub.
That's the tub. That's the tub.
Don't, don't, don't, don't get excited!
Don't get... Don't get up... Don't get...
Get the soap!
Hey, steady, men.
- We'll get him there. We'll get him.
Never say die. Never say die.
You don't...
Now, scrub good and hard
It can't be denied
That he'll look mighty cute as soon as he's dried
Well, it's good for the soul
And it's good for the hide to go...
Ain't he sweet?
Smells like a petunia.
He sure is cute!
You'll pay dearly for this!
Supper!
- Supper!
Food. Hooray!
Hah!
Magic Mirror on the wall, who now is the fairest one of all?
Over the seven jeweled hills beyond the seventh fall, in the cottage of the seven dwarfs dwells Snow White, fairest one of all.
Snow White lies dead in the forest.
The Huntsman has brought me proof.
Behold her heart.
Snow White still lives, the fairest in the land.
'Tis the heart of a pig you hold in your hand.
The heart of a pig!
Then I've been tricked!
The heart of a pig!
The blundering fool!
I'll go myself to the dwarfs' cottage in a disguise so complete no one will ever suspect.
Now, a formula to transform my beauty into ugliness, change my queenly raiment to a peddler's cloak.
Mummy Dust to make me old.
To shroud my clothes, the black of night.
To age my voice, an old hag's cackle.
To whiten my hair, a scream of fright.
A blast of wind to fan my hate!
A thunderbolt
To mix it well.
Now, begin thy magic spell.
Look!
My hands!
My voice!
My voice.
A perfect disguise.
And now...
A special sort of death for one so fair.
What shall it be?
Ah!
A poisoned apple!
Sleeping Death.
I'd like to dance and tap my feet
But they won't keep in rhythm
You see, I washed 'em both today and I can't do nothin' with 'em
Ho-hum, the tune is dumb
The words don't mean a thing
Isn't this a silly song for anyone to sing?
I...
Oh, gosh!
I chased a polecat up a tree
Way out upon a limb
And when he got the best of me
I got the worst of him
Ho-hum, the tune is dumb
The words don't mean a thing
Isn't this a silly song for anyone to sing?
Watch out. Be ca... Watch... Watch...
Watch... Watch...
Thanks.
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey!
Hooray!
That was fun!
Now you do something.
Well, what shall I do?
- Tell us a story.
Yes, tell us a story.
- A true story.
- A love story.
Well, once there was a princess.
Was the princess you?
- And she fell in love.
- Was it hard to do?
Oh, it was very easy.
Anyone could see that the Prince was charming.
The only one for me.
Was he strong and handsome?
Was he big and tall?
There's nobody like him anywhere at all.
Did he say he loved ya?
Did he steal a kiss?
He was so romantic
I could not resist
Some day my prince will come
Some day we'll meet again
And away to his castle we'll go
To be happy forever
I know
Hah! Mush!
Some day when spring is here
We'll find our love anew
And the birds will sing
And wedding bells will ring
Some day when my dreams
Come true
Oh, my goodness!
It's past bedtime.
Go right upstairs to bed.
Wait! Hold on there, men!
The, uh, Princess will sleep in our beds upstairs.
But where will you sleep?
Oh, we'll be quite comfortable down here in... in...
In a pig's eye!
In a pig's eye... Sty. No, no! I mean...
We'll be comfortable, won't we, men?
Oh, yes. Mighty comfortable.
Now don't you worry about us.
We'll be all right, ma'am.
Go right on up now, my dear.
Well, if you insist.
Good night.
Good night, Princess.
You're sure you'll be comfortable?
Oh, yes. Very comfortable.
Well, pleasant dreams.
Pleasant dreams.
Let go!
- I saw it first!
Now, men, don't get excited.
Remember, share.
It's share and share alike.
Look out, it'll rip. It'll rip!
Bless the seven little men who have been so kind to me.
And... And may my dreams come true.
Amen.
Oh, yes!
And please make Grumpy like me.
Hah! Women!
A fine kettle of fish!
Dip the apple in the brew.
Let the Sleeping Death seep through!
Look! On the skin!
The symbol of what lies within.
Now, turn red to tempt Snow White.
To make her hunger for a bite.
Have a bite?
It's not for you.
It's for Snow White.
When she breaks the tender peel to taste the apple in my hand, her breath will still, her blood congeal.
Then I'll be fairest in the land!
But wait!
There may be an antidote.
Nothing must be overlooked.
Oh, here it is!
"Love's First Kiss. "
Bah!
No fear of that.
The dwarfs will think she's dead.
She'll be buried alive!
Buried alive!
Thirsty?
Have a drink!
Now, don't forget, my dear.
The... The old Queen's a sly one, full of witchcraft.
So beware of strangers.
Don't worry. I'll be all right.
See you tonight.
Uh, yes. We... Well, c'mon, men.
Be awful careful
'cause if anything'd happen to you, I, I...
- Good-bye.
- Oh, gosh!
Hah! Disgustin'!
And be sure to watch out...
To wa... To wa...
To wa...
Watch out.
Thanks.
Well... All right.
But that's the last... Wha...
Oh, go on. Run along.
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
It's off to work we go
Heigh-ho
Good-bye! Good-bye!
Now I'm warnin' ya.
Don't let nobody or nothin' in the house.
Why, Grumpy, you do care.
Hah!
Good-bye, Grumpy!
The little men will be away and she'll be all alone with a harmless old peddler woman.
A harmless old peddler woman!
Some day my prince will come
Some day we'll meet again
And away to his castle we'll go
To be happy forever I know
Some day when spring is here
We'll find our love anew
And the birds will sing
And wedding bells will ring
Some day when my dreams
Come true
All alone, my pet?
Why, why, yes, I am. But...
The, the little men are not here?
No, they're not, but...
Mmm-hmm.
Making pies?
Yes, gooseberry pies.
It's apple pies that make the menfolks' mouths water.
Pies made from apples like these.
- Oh, they do look delicious.
- Yes!
But wait 'til you taste one, dearie.
Like to try one?
Hmm?
Go on. Go on, have a bite.
Stop it! Stop it! Go away! Go away!
Shame on you, frightening a poor old lady.
Oh, I thought I'd lost it.
There, there. I'm sorry.
Oh! My heart!
Oh, my... My poor heart.
Take me into the house and let me rest.
A drink of water, please.
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
It's off to work we go
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
Hey, look!
- Stop that!
- Get away, boy. Get away! Go on, shoo!
Go on! Get outta here!
What ails these crazy birds?
They've gone plumb daffy.
Yeah, they've...
And because you've been so good to poor old Granny,
I'll share a secret with you.
This is no ordinary apple.
It's a magic wishing apple.
A wishing apple?
Yes!
One bite and all your dreams will come true.
- Really?
- Yes, girlie.
Now, make a wish and take a bite.
- Go on, get!
- These pesky critters won't stop.
- 'Tain't natural.
There's something wrong.
They ain't actin' this way for nothin'.
Maybe the old Queen's got Snow White.
- The Queen!
Snow White!
The Queen'll kill her!
We gotta save her!
Yes! Yes! We, we, we gotta save her!
- She'll kill her!
- What'll we do?
Yes, yes, what'll we do?
Come on! Giddap!
Wait for me! Wait for...
There must be something your little heart desires.
Perhaps there's someone you love.
Well, there is someone.
I thought so. I thought so!
Old Granny knows a young girl's heart.
Now, take the apple, dearie, and make a wish.
I wish... I wish...
That's it, go on! Go on.
And that he will carry me away to his castle where we will live happily ever after.
Fine! Fine! Now take a bite.
Don't let the wish grow cold!
Oh, I feel strange.
- Her breath will still.
- Oh. Oh.
- Her blood congeal.
- Oh.
Now I'll be fairest in the land!
Hurry, hurry.
There she goes!
After her!
I'm trapped! What will I do?
The meddling little fools!
I'll fix ya. I'll fix ya.
I'll fix ya! I'll crush your bones!
Look out!
One song
One song
I have but one song
- One song
- One song
- Only for you
- For you
One heart
Tenderly beating
Ever entreating
- Constant and true
- So true
- One love
- One love
That has possessed me
- One love
- One love
- Thrilling me through
- So true
- One song
- One song
- My heart keeps singing
- Keeps singing
- Of one love
- One love
Only for you...
And away to his castle you'll go
To be happy forever we know
Good-bye.
Good-bye, Grumpy.
Good-bye.
Oh, Dopey.
Good-bye!
Some day when spring is here
We'll find our love anew
And the birds will sing
And wedding bells will ring
Some day when my dreams
Come true!
But, Mommy, if we're in India... where are all the Indians?
They're not the same kind of Indians we have in America, darling.
What kind are they then?
These are the real Indians.
The ones back home were called Indians by mistake... because... when Christopher Columbus discovered
America, he thought it was India.
Then is Grandfather an Indian?
No, dear. He's an Englishman, a colonel in the army.
You know that.
Then why doesn't he live in England?
Because Queen Victoria transferred him here.
Will we live right in Grandfather's house?
Why, of course.
Then we won't have to worry anymore about the butcher and the grocer man?
No, darling.
Too bad we didn't get acquainted with Grandfather sooner.
Look, Mommy! Look!
There's an elephant!
Are we gonna ride the rest of the way on an elephant?
Oh, no, dear. I hope not.
Now, no more questions.
- Mrs. Williams?
- Yes.
This is Sergeant MacDuff of the 7 th Highlanders.
Mommy, why does he wear that funny little petticoat?
[Mrs. Williams]
Hush, dear.
Colonel Williams sent me to meet you, ma'am.
- Thank you.
- Will you come this way, ma'am?
- There you are, missy.
- Oh, my baggage.
I have a trunk, two hat boxes-
Oh, and my mandolin.
Mandolin?
You better come with me to identify them, ma'am.
- Can I come too?
- No, dear. You wait here.
Excuse me, sir, please, mister... but is this where the circuses come from?
Yes, Missy Baba. Very hot day.
Uh-
Hey, mister! You dropped this!
- Priscilla?
- Where's Missy Baba?
- Yes.
- Priscilla!
- Priscilla!
- Hey, mister, you dropped your necklace.
Hey, wait a minute.
Our rifles- Lee-Metfords.
- Where's the thieving
Pathan you got 'em from?
- Khoda Khan.
- Khoda Khan?
- Caught him, Sergeant.
Huh. Wait until the colonel hears about this.
Take him to headquarters!
Better follow me, ma'am.
But what's a talisman used for,
Mommy?
It's a sort of sacred charm, dear.
Keep it, lassie, and hang it round your neck.
Then they say no harm can befall ya.
Will harm befall him- that man Khoda Khan- now that he hasn't got it anymore?
Oh, plenty of harm.
Don't fret your little heart.
That's a bad, bad character,
Khoda Khan.
Like the robbers in your fairy book.
Like
Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves?
Yes. Now, no more questions,
Priscilla.
Are there many ladies living at the army post, Sergeant?
Not many ladies, ma'am. It's a difficult place to live, even for a soldier.
Mr. MacDuff, is a sergeant higher than a colonel?
Not this side of paradise.
Your grandfather's the commanding officer of the whole caboodle here.
Is my grandfather nice?
Well, uh...
I can't say that he's exactly nice... but, uh, he's a grand soldier...
[Clears Throat]
And I have every respect for him.
The-The men call him "Old Boots. "
- Old Boots?
- Why do they call him that?
Well, because he still sleeps in his boots like he used to do in the old days... when a man had to be ready for emergencies, day or night.
- Sergeant MacDuff-
- Priscilla!
Mommy, I just want to ask
Sergeant MacDuff one more question.
How do you keep the mosquitoes from biting your knees?
Mohammet Dihn!
Blasted parlor maid. Dihn!
Yes. Them women is here.
Fetch the luggage.
Is that Grandfather?
Mohammet Dihn! Luggage.
Come on! Luggage, luggage!
Grandfather?
Bagby.
Fetch the luggage.
Will you sit down, ma'am?
Look.
And I presume you have no recollection of riding across the parade grounds... like a blasted maniac, on a buffalo!
- Oh, was it a buffalo?
- Bah!
I've told you before, Brandes... your antic behavior, your irresponsible attitude... is conduct unbecoming an officer.
Sets a bad example to the other men.
This is not Mayfair or a tea party on the Thames.
You're on probation, Brandes.
All privileges revoked for 30 days.
Dismissed!
I'll, uh- I'll tell him you're here.
Hello.
Is my grandfather always mad like that?
Your grandfather?
Oh, not always.
Only when he's disobeyed or- or thinks he's disobeyed.
How do you do?
- The ladies are here, sir.
- Oh. Splendid.
Good man. Thank you.
Splendid.
Uh, I must see them, I suppose.
I must report, sir, that Khoda Khan was arrested in Raj Pore today, sir.
What? Khoda Khan himself?
Caught red-handed, sir, with a dozen of our rifles.
- Must've been hiding them in Raj Pore.
- Bah!
Of all the thieving Pathans, why must they arrest the biggest blackguard of the lot?
- It looks bad, sir.
- Bad?
Having Khoda Khan under lock and key is like holding a tiger by the tail.
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Sorry! The whole hill country will be up in arms!
- I think- I think I'm gonna call you Coppy.
- Coppy?
- Priscilla!
- But why?
Because of your hair.
It's like a shiny, new copper penny.
I imagine it is pretty awful.
I like it! Don't you, Mommy?
Well, yes, of course.
Might I ask, are you here on a visit?
- No, we expect to stay.
- Oh.
Did you really ride the buffalo?
Why, yes, I- I-
- What was it like?
- Well, riding a buffalo is like-
Didn't you ever ride a buffalo?
- Come on. Climb on, and I'll show you how.
- Oh, no. I don't think she'd-
- Hold tight. Whee!
- Oh, Priscilla!
Mrs. Williams?
- Joyce, Father.
- Oh, y-yes, yes.
I, uh- I trust, uh-
I trust you had a comfortable journey.
- Yes. Thank you.
- Ah.
What the deuce is all this?
That must be Grandfather.
This is Priscilla.
- Oh.
- How do you do, Grandfather?
Well, h-h-how do you do? Uh-
Are you- Um-
This is most irregular, sir-
Oh, please don't scold Coppy again.
It wasn't Coppy's fault.
Really it wasn't.
Coppy? Who's Coppy?
Why, uh, Priscilla has a habit of nicknaming people.
- Oh.
- You have a nickname already, haven't you?
Priscilla!
Eh? Well-
Well, people usually address me as "Colonel. "
That's what I was going to call you- Colonel.
Oh, you were.
- What are you waiting for?
- Nothing, sir.
Oh, sit down. Sit down.
Coppy!
It was very kind of you to send for us.
Oh, my plain duty, madam.
Son's widow, helpless female.
I'd have sent for you years ago if I'd known you were destitute.
I didn't want anybody to know.
- But the landlady always found out-
- Hush, dear.
I did my best to work.
Very distressing. Very distressing.
Well, you're here now.
We do appreciate it.
Mommy almost cried when she got your letter, she was so glad.
Dear me. Dear me, dear me.
Uh, Bagby!
- Bagby!
- Sir?
Oh, there you are.
What the blazes are-
Show Mrs. Williams her quarters.
Yes, sir.
I trust, uh- I trust you'll accommodate yourself to the life we live here.
Army post, you know.
Routine, discipline, all that sort of thing.
- Oh, we will.
- Does that mean we get to sleep with our boots on?
- Oh, Priscilla!
- What? No, no, no. Of course not.
Huh. Boots.
Mommy.
I don't think Grandfather likes me very well.
Oh, of course he does, darling.
Perhaps he just doesn't understand little girls.
You see, the colonel's always been used to soldiers.
Mommy, I want to go home.
Oh, but, darling... this is our home.
Hey! Pump that water!
Turn out the guards! Who's it-
- Hey, Sergeant!
- Come out here!
- Let me go! Sergeant!
- You'll get your bath!
- I won't do it again!
- Give him a bath, Sergeant!
- Come on, Mott.
- Hey, Sergeant!
- Hello. What are you doing, bathing?
- Yes, sir!
Clean little chappie.
Eyes right!
Party, attention!
Present arms!
It's awfully hot for so early in the morning, isn't it?
Have you been standing here all night?
Can't you even shake your head yes or no?
Priscilla, you mustn't annoy the sentry.
I wasn't annoying him, Mommy.
The poor mars deaf and dumb.
Oh, no, dear. It's just that he's not allowed to talk on duty.
- Come here, darling.
- Oh.
Here. You must wear this whenever you go outdoors.
Oh, but I like it.
It's gonna make me feel like a soldier.
And remember all the things you've been told.
I know them all by heart.
Don't eat any fresh fruit.
Don't drink any water unless it's boiled.
Don't ever go outside the army gates.
Keep out of the sun, and- and-
And don't talk to sentries.
- Good morning, Colonel.
- Good morning.
Keep that on your head whenever you go out in the sun.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Sunstroke. Bad.
You're looking a bit off- off color, peaky.
Oh, I-I feel all right.
Oh, want more meat on your bones.
- Ought to eat more.
- Oh, we expect to.
Oh. Do you know how to ride?
Oh, yes. Oh, but I haven't ridden for ever so long.
Oh, here. Mohammet Dihn!
- Mohammet Dihn!
- Mohammet Dihn!
Mohammet Dihn!
- Mohammet Dihn!
- What are you shouting for like this?
- Where is that infernal parlor maid?
- Mohammet Dihn!
Dihn!
- Oh, there you are. What the-
- Yes, sir, Colonel, sahib.
Uh, get Mrs. Williams a good horse.
- She's going riding. You go with her.
- Thank you, Colonel.
Oh, uh, good morning.
- Your helmet, sir.
- What?
Oh. Ah. Thank you.
Colonel, sunstroke.
Ah, yes.
Yes, yes.
I think he's gonna like you, Mommy... even if he doesn't like me.
- Orders, sir, from the adjutant.
- Put them inside, on my desk.
Oh, sir. I do want to thank you for ordering me a new uniform.
[Colonel] Glad to do it, Mott.
Got a good record.
Always neat. Military appearance.
- Make a good soldier one day, won't you?
- Oh, thank you, sir!
Hello.
- Hello, Mr. Mott.
- Hello.
- Who are you?
- I'm Priscilla.
- Wait a minute, will you?
- Can't.
Orders, sir.
Thank you, Mott.
Orders, sir.
All right, Patrolman Mott.
Can't you answer just one question... if it is about military matters?
- Well, what is it?
- How can I get to be a soldier?
- You?
- Really! It's important.
Who ever heard of a little girl being a soldier?
Run along home and play with your dolls... and don't follow me anymore.
- Why, hello there.
- Oh, hello, Coppy.
How's your mother?
- She's a bit peaky.
- A bit peaky?
Yes. She's going riding to put some meat on her bones.
I'm going riding too.
I might meet her.
Coppy, I'm kind of worried.
You are? About what?
I've gotta be a soldier, and I don't know how to start.
Whoever put that idea into your head?
The colonel.
You see, the colonel's never had any little girls around.
All he understands is soldiers.
So I've decided to be one.
Then maybe he'll like me.
How do I start, Coppy?
Well, let's see.
MacDuff.
- Yes, sir.
- Good morning, Sergeant!
Good morning, lassie.
Good morning.
We've a brand-new rookie, Sergeant.
Please instruct Priscilla in the manual of arms, the queers regulations... and all matters appertaining thereto.
- But, sir, you- I mean-
- Why, yes, certainly. Carry on.
Company... left turn!
Quick!
About turn!
Quick!
March!
Mother!
Elsie, did you ever?
He's with that American.
She didn't lose much time getting her hands on him.
He didn't lose much time either.
I suppose she knows he's coming in to the title.
- Better get a move on.
- But, Mother!
He hasn't looked at me twice in all the time we've been here.
Well, your father didn't look at me at first... but here you are, Elsie.
You made a very good beginning.
Yes, but whoever heard of a soldier called Priscilla?
Aye, that's the point.
You couldn't take Private Priscilla very seriously, could you?
We'll have to find a new name for you.
I got it!
I've got it.
Wee Willie Winkie.
Wee Willie Winkie?
Was he a friend of yours?
Ah, he was a lad that ran through an old Scotch rhyme.
"Wee Willie Winkie ran through the town. "
Wee Willie Winkie ran through the town-
He ran through the-
Well, he was a lad that was always getting himself into difficulties.
Hmm. Sunstroke. Bad.
Was he a sergeant?
He probably would've been when he grew up.
Party, one, two, three!
Wee Willie Winkie.
- It does sound like a soldier, doesn't it?
- Aye.
Then I'd be Private Winkie!
Private Winkie it is!
A full-fledged soldier of the queen.
Wort it be a grand surprise for the colonel?
[Laughing]
It will indeed!
And beyond that sign lies all Asia-
Baghdad, Samarqand, the forbidden city of Lhasa... even the Great Wall of China.
This is the gateway to it all.
For thousands of years, the great caravans passing through... have been robbed by the wild Afridis and Pathans.
Up there in those hills is the stronghold of Khoda Khan.
Khoda Khan, the chief they arrested in Raj Pore.
Yes.
You see that pass?
With a hundred rifles, they could hold off our entire brigade.
I read about it in school... but you make it sound so thrilling and romantic.
Look, Corporal! I've got it at last.
- Got what?
- My new uniform.
- The kilt is all wool.
- Ha! Wool!
Wool from the cotton mills of Manchester.
Good lad.
Uh, Mr. Mott.
- Wort you spend the time of day with a man?
- Why-Why, yes, sir.
- And what you got there, laddie?
- My new uniform, sir.
Aye. But you're not daft enough to wear it like that, are you?
- Why, what's wrong with it, sir?
- What's wrong!
Why, it's got to be sterilized, lad.
- Sterilized?
- Aye, sure.
How many times have I told you that in
India, everything has to be sterilized?
The food you eat, the water you drink.
But- But not uniforms, sir.
Aye, laddie. It's a new order.
You don't want to get the black majoobies, do you?
- The black majoobies?
- Ah, it's a terrible disease.
Aye.
Here. I'll sterilize it meself.
Oh, thank you, sir!
Aye. Aye.
McTavish.
McLeish.
McAdoo. McNab.
Oh. Well, thank you, gentlemen.
Thank you so much.
It's about done.
- Aye.
- Oh, it's properly sterilized now.
- Aye.
- Why, it's shrunk!
- Aye, it shrunk.
- Aye. It shrunk.
- All but the buttons.
- All but the buttons.
Gentlemen, you did this deliberately!
- What?
- I did-
- Did you hear what he accused me of?
- Aye, I did that.
- Of deliberately doing it.
- Tsk, tsk, tsk.
He's a bad lad.
Aye. He's a bad lad.
Of deliberately doing it.
How does it look to you, Sergeant?
Very satisfactory.
Stand at attention, and I'll inspect you.
Keep your eyes to the front.
Take the smile off your face.
Aye. That's good.
I thought maybe I'd boiled it a little bit too much.
- Boiled it?
- Aye. Just a military requirement.
Take this. It'll give you a little bit more importance.
Oh, it's just elegant.
Hmm. I carved it meself.
- Thanks.
- Welcome.
Let's let the men take a squint at you.
Slope... arms!
Right, left. Turn!
Quick turn!
Military escort, halt!
Khoda Khan, sir.
Very good, Corporal.
Escort, about! Turn!
Quick! March!
This way, if you please.
Take this for me, will you, please?
- Mr. Khan!
- Hmm.
Mr. Khan. You dropped this.
Mr. Khan, here's your necklace.
May Allah bless and protect thee... for the rest of thy days.
- Thank you very much.
- Private Winkie!
Come here!
Get under there. There.
Aw, look what you've done now!
You got your kilt all dirty.
Come here. I've a good mind to-
But he was so glad to get back his necklace, Sergeant.
Well, it'll take more than a necklace to get him out of that jail.
But why are they gonna put him in jail?
Aw, because he's a black-hearted, thieving Pathan, that's why.
But he was such a nice gentleman.
Gentleman? Pooh!
Gentleman!
Why, he'd cut your head off as soon as look at you.
Ah-
Stay over here. Wait there, lassie.
Outside, you lazy scrubs!
Outside for a special drill!
What? Special drill?
- Whose orders?
- My orders.
- Your orders!
- Yeah. My orders!
He says his orders.
Lassie, about turn.
Donald.
That's me when I was a little baby.
Oh, I think you were just beautiful.
Party, attention!
Slope... arms!
One, two, three!
Present... arms!
One, two, three!
Snap into it, will you? Snap into it!
Take that smile off your face.
Slope... arms!
One, two!
Now, on the third syllable of the word "turn"... you smartly turn to the right... snapping your left heel against the right heel... with the toes at the angle of 45 degrees, approximately!
Now, smartly!
Right... turn!
Quick! March!
Left. Left. Left. Left.
About turn! One, two, three!
Left. Left. Left.
Left. Left. Left. Left.
Party, halt!
Right turn!
Quick, get in the dress there. You're always the last man to obey the word of command!
Always the last man!
Come out in dress here.
Order! Hey.
Are you grinnin' at me?
Order!
Arms! Two!
Stand at ease!
If you persist with this stubborn silence, Khoda Khan... we shall never get anywhere.
I tell you fror the last time... we are prepared to give you your immediate release... on condition that you guarantee there'll be no more stealing of rifles... no more raids and no more plundering.
Speak up, man!
This is your last chance for freedom.
I ask nothing... and I give nothing.
Take him away.
Escort, attention! Right turn!
Quick! March!
- Sergeant.
- Party, halt!
Sergeant, what's the meaning of this?
Drilling in the midday sun? Huh?
- Yes, sir, I-You see, sir-
- Huh?
- Yes, sir. L-I-
- What's the matter?
- Yes, sir. I-I-I-
- Can't you talk, man?
Yes, sir.
You see, sir, I-I-
- Come on with it!
- Very good, sir.
You see, sir,
I- I thought a little- thought a little drill wouldn't do them any harm, sir.
The men are getting a little rusty, sir.
With your permission, General.
Party, form fours!
What's this? What's this? What's this?
Private Winkie, sir.
- A new recruit.
- Yes, sir.
Fear God, honor the queen, shoot straight and keep clean.
Very funny.
Silence!
The rascals are pulling your leg, Colonel.
Fine soldier.
- Captain Bibberbeigh?
- Yes, sir.
I think a little polishing will remove that rustiness in quick time.
Sergeant MacDuff can take that party out... for three hours extra drill.
Yes, sir.
Private Winkie's excused.
Go in and get your nap.
Sergeant MacDuff, the colonel feels... that three hours extra drill would eliminate that, uh, rustiness.
Form two deep.
Pipe Major Sneath will play you around.
Quick. Mark time.
Forward!
I'm sorry that Priscilla and I-
This is a cantonment under military discipline... and I wish that you and the child would keep to your own quarters.
I will not have this cantonment turned into a confounded nursery!
Dismissed. I mean, that's all.
Good afternoon.
Mr. MacLeish...
I'm a very unpopular man.
Soon we'll be up to a hundred.
Then it'll be all done.
- Then what'll we do, Mommy?
- Start another one, I suppose.
Memsahib,
Major Mrs. MacMonachie.
MacMonachie?
MacMonachie.
Show them in.
We'd better put these away.
Mommy, do you want me to make myself scarce?
If you want to go out and play, go on.
- I thought perhaps we might, uh-
- I was just passing.
- I'm so glad you came.
- How are you, my dear?
Just fine, thank you.
Darling, go tell Mohammet Dihn to bring us some tea.
- Remember when you go out-
- Keep away from the soldiers. Hello.
Keep out of the sun.
Keep out of Mrs. Allardyce's petunias.
Oh! I just thought of a good name for her!
Mrs. Snoopysnoot.
Extraordinary.
Tea for memsahibs.
You always hear everything, don't you, Mohammet Dihn?
Mohammet Dihn hears very much, knows very much.
Knows something very sad about your friend.
My friend? Coppy?
The one who is in the prison.
You mean in jail.
Khoda Khan.
Why you not go see him?
Khoda Khan very sad, very lonely.
But when he sees you, his heart is glad.
Poor man.
I go now, make tea for memsahibs.
You kind little girl.
You go see Khoda Khan, huh?
- If you think it would make him happy.
- Very much happy.
All right. I will.
- You give him this.
- What is it?
Mohammet Dihn prayer.
Bring peace to his heart.
Here.
Like a brave soldier. Carry dispatch.
Big secret-just you, me.
Not let anybody know.
Oh, I won't.
I found it very difficult to adapt myself, too... when I first came from England.
- You know, I remember-
- The sound of those bugles almost drove me mad.
- The soldiers were-
- Does it affect you that way?
Yes.
But I- I've an idea it won't be so dull for you.
What do you mean?
Oh, Lieutenant Brandes asked me to tell you that he was going to be in Raj Pore... tomorrow afternoon... and if you happen to be there, just by chance, my dear-
Hello, Mr. Khan. How are you today?
Why do you come here?
I thought you might be lonesome.
You're a strange child.
Aren't you sorry now you made all that trouble about those old rifles?
I'm sorry only because
I lost the rifles... and my freedom as well.
But if you told the colonel you were sorry and promised to be good... then he'd let you out of jail.
You are sorry, aren't you?
No.
Then you'll have to stay here,
I suppose, until you are.
- Well, good-bye, Mr. Khan.
- Good-bye.
Oh.
I almost forgot.
Here. It's a prayer.
Mohammet Dihn said it would bring peace to your heart.
Mohammet Dihn speaks the truth.
Well, good-bye, Mr. Khan.
- Private Winkie, get on off of there!
- I was just leaving.
This way. Don't let me catch you here again. Go on here.
Sorry.
Now- Now the fundamental principles... of the noble art of self-defense...
- is, first of all, defense.
- Aye!
Now, balance your body... equal on each leg... bending your knees in the center.
Now, come on. Let's have it now.
Put your left hand in front of your face, your right hand up for defense.
Now, come on. A little spring.
Now, spring with me.
- More spring!
- Now spring with me.
Hey, hey, Donald! Donald!
Demonstrate the punch.
Aye. The punch. The punch.
Uh, Mr. MacTavish,
I'll give you an opportunity... to clout me on the nose... with your left hand.
You see, you never get back there.
- You see, the man has no footwork.
- You're right, Donald.
Now with the right hand this time.
Right hand. Again.
You see?
- The man left the whole of his right side exposed.
- Aye.
Mr. MacTavish...
I'm afraid you'll never make a boxer.
Mr. MacTavish, I'm talking to you.
Excuse me.
Can't we ever play together anymore?
No, lassie.
You've got your orders, and I've got my orders.
Can't you teach me the manly art of self-defense?
I'd like to... but if Old Man Boots was to catch us... it would be very bad indeed.
Just straighten your left hand up.
Put that up for your defense.
Oh, Mr. Mott!
Oh, they're just beautiful.
What are they?
- Puppies, stupid.
- I mean, what brand are they?
You mean breed.
They're pure mongrels.
Pure mongrels?
I wish I had one of them.
Well, you can't. They're mine.
So soft and cuddly.
I'd give anything for one.
Well, what would you give?
- Will you-Will you trade?
- Well, that depends.
- I'll give you my toys.
- What have you got?
Oh, heaps.
Three dolls- only one's got a broken leg.
And a cookstove. And a tea set.
No. Girls' things. Hmm.
I'd give you one if I had six or seven dogs, but I've only got the two.
Can't I hold him for just a little while?
No! You're liable to get too attached to him.
Oh, good morning, sir.
Hey, Mr. Sneath.
Will you steal me a wee dog like a good man?
- A dog, Donald?
- Aye.
Sit up. Come on. Sit up!
There he is!
But, Sergeant, they're mine!
Yours? You're laboring under a grave misapprehension, laddie.
They're his.
- His?
- He's the father!
You don't deny the right of a father to his own bairns, would you?
- But- But, Sergeant!
- Look how happy he is.
There's no question of his paternity.
But I got him from his mother.
From his mother!
- It's the father that counts.
- Aye.
It's the man that has the right to his own sons. You ought to know that!
- Aye!
- At your age.
But can't I even have one of them?
No. You have no right whatsoever, laddie.
But, please, sir.
Aye.
Well, if you'll swear by the ghost of the Black Douglas-
And the unburied dead of Culloden.
- And the whiskers of William Wallace.
- Yeah.
And, uh-
That you'll promise never to blow that bugle in my ear again... well, uh, I'll give you the wee one.
Oh, sir, I'll promise.
I'll promise anything!
Oh, thank you, sir!
Thank you so much!
Oh, man, you did a great deed.
Come on. Sit up. Sit up.
Come on. Sit up.
Oh, Mommy, look. There's that man eating swords again. Look.
Run over and watch him there, and give him these coppers.
- May I, Mommy?
- Of course, dear.
Thanks.
That's the most wonderfullest thing
I've ever seen.
There's that child.
No, I don't care for any of these.
Thank you. Elsie.
Just as I thought. Disgusting!
If you had a thimble full of brains, Elsie... you'd have landed him yourself.
- But, Mama, I did everything you told me.
- Oh, you are anemic.
But, Coppy,
I can't openly defy him.
Why not? You're not one of his soldiers to be ordered about... and forbidden to do this, that and the other.
You have the right to see whom you please, where you please and when you please.
- And there's no regulation-
- But, Coppy, you don't understand.
I'm under an obligation to him for sending for me- having us here.
And for making your life miserable,
I presume.
- He doesn't mean to.
- He does mean to.
He revels in it, the old porcupine.
You are coming to that dance with me... no matter what happens.
Coppy, I'd love to, but I don't see how I'm going to manage it.
Archie! Archie!
- No, Elsie, you are definitely anemic.
- But, Mother-
Well, your father's people were anemic.
Oh! Go away!
This nasty little dog!
Archie, you mustn't. You mustn't!
Shoo. Shoo.
Go away. Go away!
- You stop hitting Archie!
- Archie should leave things alone.
He bit me! He bit me!
He bit me.
Mama!
Well, you hit him first.
- Nothing of the kind.
- You did! I saw you.
The colonel shall hear about this.
I've been attacked.
Do you understand?
I've been attacked by a mad dog.
- Yes.
- Before I could fight him off... the creature charged at me.
- Yes.
- Well, do you understand?
- Yes.
- Oh, Elsie, come along.
Come, Mama.
Yes.
Let go! Let go! I won't let you!
- It's the colonel's orders.
- I don't care whose orders it is.
- You let go of Archie. Let go.
- What's all this?
That letter you sent out, ordering
Sergeant MacDuff to destroy all the dogs.
- I changed it.
- You did what?
Sergeant MacDuff, what's the meaning of this?
It wasn't his fault.
He told me you'd bite my head off.
But I don't care what you do.
It was the meanest thing
I ever heard of.
Ordering him to- to destroy all those puppies.
But don't you know there's a mad dog around?
Yes, sir. Archie here was awful mad at Mrs. Allardyce.
But if she'd smacked you on the ear with her parasol, you'd have bitten her too.
What? That ridiculous puppy?
Bagby, look at it.
Why, from what I heard, she said it was a huge beast.
Raving mad, foaming at the mouth.
Is that what old Snoopysnoot said?
What? Snoopysnoot? Snoopysnoot!
- Oh, Grandfather, you have the wonderfullest laugh.
- Have I?
It sounds just like an old horse that's got the whooping cough.
What? An old horse with a whooping cough.
Good evening, Private Bagby.
- Private Winkie.
- Good evening, Grandfather.
Come to say good night?
Yes, Grandfather.
Now, you want me to tell you a story, I suppose.
No, if you don't mind,
I'd rather ask you a few questions.
Oh, good Lord. Don't you ever get tired of asking questions?
Bagby, shut that noise out.
Yes, sir.
I'm very tired sometimes, but that's the only way I can find out things.
Well, fire ahead.
You know all the stories you've been telling me lately... about the time you held off that detachment of Afridis for a whole week single-handed?
Well, practically single-handed, yes.
And the time you marched those Ghurkas across the desert... clean through a blasted simoom.
I did not say "blasted. "
Well, dashed.
Yes, dashed. All right.
And the time you were almost captured... and laid 16 Waziris low with the butt of your bally rifle.
Yes. That got me me first ribbon.
Yes. Always fighting and marching and working.
Well, that's been my life.
Well, what I want to ask is... don't you ever have a good time- fun, I mean?
No time for fun.
But you have time now, haven't you?
You're not doing nothing but sitting here smoking your pipe.
What do you want me to do?
Stand on me head?
Someday maybe.
But, Grandfather... won't ya- can't you take Mommy to the dance tonight?
Oh, so that's it, is it? Oh.
Oh, please. Listen.
Doesn't that music make your feet just itch to dance?
My dancing days are over.
But Mommy's aren't.
Couldn't you take her and just sit around like a... uh, cauliflower?
Like a what? Uh-
A wallflower you mean. Not me.
Oh, please.
Make it a surprise.
I won't tell her a word.
- Oh, we'll see about it.
- Oh, Grandfather.
Now you pop off to bed.
You'd wheedle the whiskers off a thistle.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Bagby.
- Private Bagby!
Bagby!
Yes, sir.
- Get my Wellingtons.
- Your what, sir?
My Wellingtons, you idiot!
My Wellingtons!
Your Wellingtons?
Yes, my dress boots.
I'm going to dance.
Very well, sir. You know, you didn't take your nap this afternoon.
Joyce? Joyce?
- Do you dare?
- But, Coppy, you're on duty and you're not dressed.
- Oh, come on. Let's listen to the music.
- Well-
Joyce?
Joyce?
Coppy, this is so much nicer than being in that stuffy pavilion.
Mmm. It's so fragrant out here with the scent of the blossoms.
Yes. I shall think of it often when I'm back in England...
- tramping over the moors in the rain-
- England!
Yes. I'm resigning my commission.
You are? Oh, Coppy.
No, I just wanted to see the expression in your eyes.
Oh, Coppy, you're dreadful.
You do care, don't you?
No.
You idiot.
- Why, good evening, sir.
- Good evening, Beak.
- Ah, Mrs. MacMonachie.
- Why, Colonel.
- Have you brought your daughter-in-law?
- Yes. No. Um, is she here?
- I haven't seen her.
- Ah. Will you excuse me? I'll look for her.
Carry on. Carry on.
- Raiders are attacking the arsenal, sir.
- Gentlemen, your posts!
It's the arsenal!
On the double, boys.
On the double.
Give me your rifle, quick!
- Corporal.
- Sir.
Two casualties on our side, sir.
Guns and ammunition all intact.
- And the fire's under control.
- Good.
Ha! They thought they'd catch us napping, eh?
- Prisoner, sir. I think he's a chief.
- That's good.
But, uh, Khoda Khan escaped, sir.
- Escaped?
- Aye.
So that was their game.
They've tricked us.
Tell him we'll give him the lash. We'll give him the lash if he won't speak up.
No speak, Colonel.
- Take him out.
- Prisoner escort, attention, quick march!
Captain Stuart, one moment.
Mr. Brandes. Captain Stuart.
Telegraph Raj Pore. Have them relay the news to the other posts... that Khoda Khan has escaped.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Brandes, you're under arrest.
I, sir? For what?
For deserting your post, sir.
- Well, Bibberbeigh, what luck?
- They've scattered like geese, sir.
Ah! Well, you men had better get some sleep.
- There'll be nothing more to do tonight.
- Good night, sir.
Good night.
- Colonel?
- Well?
Why did you have
Coppy put under arrest?
- You know perfectly well why.
- Yes, perfectly.
Because you've had it in for him all along.
- He deserted his post.
- But the raid would have occurred just the same.
You're using that just as a pretext- uh, a technicality.
Doing everything you can to keep us-
I am not interested now in the affairs of your heart.
But I cannot have you interfering... with the discipline and obedience that I demand from my men.
Discipline? You've no heart.
All you've got inside of you is a book of army regulations!
I've had enough of it!
I'm sorry I ever came here, put myself under obligation to you!
Well, you won't have to put up with us any longer- not a single day longer!
- Why are you crying, Mommy?
- Priscilla.
What are you doing here?
Come on back to bed.
- Why are you making my mommy cry?
- Priscilla, hush.
Mommy was always happy till we came here, no matter what happened.
Priscilla, dear.
I don't care. You've no one to stick up for you here except me.
Making her so miserable... just when I was beginning to think you were nice and kind... and liked Mommy and me.
Oh. Come here, dear.
You don't understand... either of you.
Joyce, you've never seen a whole regiment wiped out... because of a blunder... or laxity in discipline.
You've never seen death all around you.
But I have.
Priscilla, up in those hills... there are thousands of savages all waiting for the chance... to sweep down the pass and ravage India.
Now... it's England's duty.
It's my duty, dear... to see that they don't.
As long as I live... that duty is going to be done.
The only women we want here are those who can understand that... and respect it.
Yes, perhaps you're right.
It might be better if you did go home.
Of course, I'll continue to provide for you. L-
I wish we could-
We can't get through to Raj Pore, sir.
The wires are cut.
- Eh? What's that?
- The wires are cut, sir.
We can't get through to Raj Pore.
Well, that means we're in for it.
Are we really going back to America, Mommy?
Yes, dear.
And leave Coppy and Sergeant MacDuff and Mr. Mott and everybody?
Yes, we're going back home.
That's where we belong.
- The patrol has just left for the hills.
- Oh? Who's in command?
- Lieutenant Brandes.
- Brandes? I thought he was under restrictions.
- You ordered all men released for service.
- Ah!
I can't imagine the patrol being in less competent hands.
However, it's done now.
Come on. Come on.
Well, what's this?
What's this? What's this?
We're leaving. We were just waiting to say good-bye to you.
That's impossible. You can't go now.
The roads aren't safe.
You'll have to wait.
Maybe for weeks.
Then we aren't going? We'll see
Coppy again and Sergeant MacDuff?
Please, Colonel, when is his trial going to be?
There's not going to be any trial.
He's off.
He's gone- gone on a dangerous mission.
The patrol has been ambushed, sir.
Cut out.
Ambushed? We're in for it now.
Are you all right, sir?
Did they hit you badly, sir?
Are you badly hurt, Donald?
Where did they hit you, man?
Oh, it's too bad. Those dirty dogs.
- Hello, Pipe Major-
- Not now, lassie.
Now look here, Winkie.
Keep away from these here rifles.
Corporal, what is-
Go on, Winkie. Come on. Beat it.
Hello, Sandy.
It's so sharp that a man can shave himself with it.
- Mr. Mott.
- Hello.
- Hello, Mr. Mott.
- Hello.
Will you please tell me what they're all getting ready to shoot?
Why, Khoda Khan of course.
Who do you think?
Khoda Khan. Why?
Just because he ran away?
Why is everybody mad at Khoda Khan?
Ha! That's a good one, that is.
"Why is everybody mad at Khoda Khan?"
Why are all the horses getting new shoes?
So they can run fast enough to catch Khoda Khan?
Missy Winkie, I am busy.
Go away, please.
I know somebody who will tell me.
Psst.
Can you come here a minute?
I came to call on Sergeant MacDuff.
I'm "afeered" that you can't see the sergeant just now.
Is he asleep?
Aye.
Will you give him these as soon as he wakes up?
Aye.
Oh, they're beautiful.
I picked them in Mrs. Allardyce's garden.
She wasn't home.
No hope?
Oh, Grandfather, I do hope
Sergeant MacDuff's feeling better.
Yes, my dear, much better.
I'm awfully glad, because I gotta talk to him about something- a secret.
All right, my dear.
You can go in.
- But don't stay too long.
- I won't. Thank you.
- I'm glad she came.
- Yes, he's been asking for her.
I'll take them.
Private Winkie reporting, Sergeant.
Before we commence drill... you'll please repeat... the recruiter's motto.
Fear God, honor the queen, shoot straight and keep clean.
Very good, lassie.
Lassie... will ya... sing me... the song once more?
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And never brought to mind
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And days auld lang syne
For auld lang syne, my dear
For auld lang syne
We'll take a cup o' kindness yet
For auld lang syne
So here's a hand, my trusty friend
And "gies" us a hand of thine
We'll meet again some other day
For the days of auld lang syne
Shh. He's asleep.
Don't you cry.
He isn't going to transfer you.
Sergeant MacDuff.
They're taking you away from me.
I want you to come back and play with me some more.
Orderly?
- Orderly!
- It's only me.
What are you doing out of bed at this time of night?
I couldn't go to sleep.
I've been awfully worried about something.
- I had to come and ask you about it.
- Oh?
Well, what is it?
Why did Sergeant MacDuff have to- have to-
I liked him. I liked him so much.
Sergeant MacDuff died as a brave soldier should- for his queen.
But the queen didn't want him to die.
Did she?
- Why, no, of course not.
- Then why-
Now, you're only a little child.
You can't understand.
No, I guess I don't.
That's why I came to you.
Why is everybody so mad at Khoda Khan?
Why do they all want to shoot him?
We're not mad at Khoda Khan.
England wants to be friends with all of her people.
But if we don't shoot Khoda Khan,
Khoda Khan will shoot us.
Now come here.
Let me try and explain to you.
It's our job to keep the big pass open... so that trade can flow through it.
- You know what trade is?
- Yes, Grandfather.
Good. And bring peace and prosperity to everybody, even to Khoda Khan.
Couldrt you go and explain all that to him?
It wouldn't be much use.
For thousands ofr years, these Pathans have lived by plundering.
They don't seem to realize they'd live much better... if they planted crops and traded and became civilized.
But, Grandfather, I don't want anybody more to get killed.
Neither do I, my child.
Neither do I.
But don't worry your little head about that anymore tonight.
- Oh, I wish something could be done.
- You run along to bed!
- Good night, Grandfather.
- Good night, little child.
- Oh, you frightened me.
- What are you doing here?
I'm going to see Khoda Khan.
Please help me get my pony.
And be very quiet.
Khoda Khan live far away.
I take you to him.
Oh, thank you.
I'm sure I'd have had an awful lot of trouble finding his house.
Come, come.
Priscilla!
- Father, Priscilla, she's gone.
- Gone?
- Her bed hasn't been slept in.
- Eh?
- Bagby. Bagby, go to the stable.
See if the child's there.
- Yes, sir.
Then Mohammet Dihn stole his can't and clothes.
The sentries, thinking he was the regular driver, allowed the car to leave the post.
Then-Then Mohammet Dihn took her away.
We found her footprints in the dust beside the tracks of the can't.
The whole thing's clear to me now.
Mohammet Dihn's the spy.
- And he's taking her there.
- To Khoda Khan?
Sound the assembly!
Well, Mr. Khan certainly does have a lot of steps in his house.
- Oh. Only 400 or 500 more. Come on.
- Oh, my goodness.
Khoda Khan. Khoda Khan.
Khoda Khan.
Mohammet Dihn.
It's a lovely morning, isn't it?
Khoda Khan!
- Khoda Khan.
- Speak, Mohammet Dihn.
- I bring you great treasure.
- Rifles?
No. Colonel Sahib's little granddaughter.
- You brought her here?
- Yes. Outside.
Then they will come- colonel, officers, everybody.
Through the pass, up the steps.
A whole regiment wiped out.
Allah be praised.
Mohammet Dihn, where are you?
Mohammet Dihn?
- How do you do, Mr. Khan?
- Welcome, little one.
How do you do, Mr. Khan?
They will not harm you, my chieftains.
I didn't know it was so far.
It's a good thing I didn't come by myself, like I was going to.
- You were coming here by yourself?
- Yes.
I decided last night
I had to see you, Mr. Khan.
Right away, to talk to you.
If you don't mind, may I sit down?
I'm awful tired.
And awful hungry too.
Now eat, and we will talk.
It's about the war.
- I want to ask you a question.
- Ask.
You don't want a lot of your friends to be killed, do you?
No.
Then don't you think it's awful silly to be mad all the time and fighting... when you don't have to?
Why don't you ask your grandfather that question?
I did, and he said he didn't want the war, but you wanted it.
Then you would stop the war, wouldn't you, if I could make you understand?
What is there to understand?
What my grandfather told me.
That the queen wants to protect all her people and make them happy and rich and all that.
It's no laughing matter!
It's true, all of it!
All you have to do is to sit down and talk it over with my grandfather.
Please don't laugh at me, Mr. Khan.
Allah himself would laugh, my child.
Then you want to fight.
And I thought you were good.
You had such nice eyes.
And I gave you back your necklace.
Please, Mr. Khan.
Please don't have any war.
Please don't.
Between your people and mine, little one... there can be only war.
Then you want war! You want to fight!
You want to kill people!
Like you did my friend.
Poor Sergeant MacDuff.
Oh, I hate you. I hate you!
I think you're all very, very mean!
"We will attack immediately unless the child is released. "
Khoda Khan!
Well, Mr. Dihn.
Zig, forward.
"Come thou.
Long has Khoda Khan waited... to meet the British in battle on these steps. "
- Shall we attack, sir?
- Impossible.
Shouldn't have a chance.
They'd wipe us all out.
What are you going to do, sir?
If I don't come back with Winkie, you'll have to fight your way through.
Stuart, you'll attack left flank.
- Yes, sir.
- Brandes.
- You know what you have to do.
- Yes, sir.
Stand fast!
Grandfather! Grandfather!
Grandfather!
Grandfather!
Oh, Grandfather.
Here's one for MacDuff.
Please don't let them shoot my grandfather.
You will not be harmed.
Khoda Khan, I-
I owe you a debt of gratitude.
You owe a debt of gratitude to her, your granddaughter.
Incredible.
Most extraordinary.
Now we shall talk,
Colonel Williams, but quietly.
Battalion, attention!
Parades will retire... in fours from the right!
Battalion, arms up!
Arms up!
- Private Winkie.
- Yes, Private Mott?
I'm forced to admit that you make a very good soldier.
You-Well, you covered yourself with glory... and distinction on the field of battle.
Thank you, Private Mott.
Sergeant MacDuff, he would have been very proud of you.
Thank you, Private Mott.
That means more to me than all the other things put together.
Thank you.
Battalion, eyes left!
(gunshots)
(speaks Chinese)
(shouting)
(speaks Chinese)
(shouting)
As magistrate of this village, it is my duty to warn you that Hi Chung, the bandit, is on his way here.
Thank you for telling us.
- Shall I pack?
- No.
- But, Alfred...
- We are missionaries.
Providence sent us here to fight evil, not flee from it.
Will you allow me to take little Ching-Ching out of harm's way?
Barbara will remain here with us.
And I wish you would not refer to her as Ching-Ching.
Mr Kruikshank, you may do as you wish with your own life.
But Ching... Barbara is a child.
- Her honourable parents were my friends.
- I know.
But they did not desert their post when danger threatened.
No.
And they were killed.
Please. Alfred!
I have decided.
(they speak Chinese)
(uproar)
(speaks Chinese)
(speaks Chinese)
(speaks Chinese)
- Greetings, most honourable Sun Lo.
- Greetings, Ching-Ching.
May your shadow lengthen always in the sun of happiness.
Thank you.
May the bird of prosperity continue to nest in your rooftop.
(they speak Chinese)
I hope you will always remember the sayings of our wise men.
I will, because you taught them to me.
It was a great privilege to instruct the daughter of my friends, your honourable father and mother.
Friendship is a tree of shelter from the rains of trouble.
Yes.
And so it is my wish to protect you from trouble that may be here very soon.
- What kind of trouble?
- Bad men.
- There will be looting and destruction.
- Oh...
I have arranged for Chang to take you to the home of my honourable brother in Shanghai.
Shanghai? Oh, that's wonderful.
I remember all the beautiful stories my daddy used to tell me about it.
But I'm afraid I'll have to ask
Mr Kruikshank for his permission.
You know, he's awfully strict with me.
Don't worry about that, my little one.
I will satisfactorily explain for you.
You will?
Oh, thank you, most honourable Sun Lo.
(speaks Chinese)
(speaks Chinese)
Goodbye, my little friend.
I shall see you very soon.
And until then, the memory of you will bloom like a flower in the garden of my heart.
(ship's whistle)
(speaks Chinese)
(they speak Chinese)
(shouts in Chinese)
(speaks Chinese)
(barks)
Shh!
I know you're hungry, but stop barking.
Your stomach has no ears.
(speaks Chinese)
Where's Chang?
Chang! Oh, Chang!
Chang!
I guess he went for breakfast.
And that's what you want, isn't it?
Hey! Hey!
(speaks Chinese)
(speaks Chinese)
(speaks Chinese)
(speaks Chinese)
(speaks Chinese)
As Sun Lo says, one cannot eat gold, but one cannot eat without it.
(speaks Chinese)
(speaks Chinese)
Come on, Mr Wu, we'll find something to eat.
Oh, no, no. Is there anyone here who speaks English? I want to buy something.
(speaks Chinese)
Look, I want to buy a dragon's head.
Head. Though I can't imagine why.
(merchant speaks Chinese)
No, me likee buy one piecee dragon head.
Catch on?
(speaks Chinese)
Lookee.
Dragon. Head. See?
Isn't there anyone who understands English?
I can, mister.
Hello. You wouldn't by any chance be able to understand Chinese too, would you?
(speaks Chinese)
Oh...
- Can you ask him how much he wants for it?
- (speaks Chinese)
(speaks Chinese)
- He says $15.
No, no.
(speaks Chinese)
(speaks Chinese)
- What's wrong now?
- He's trying to cheat you.
The price is $5. Look.
Oh, yes, so it is.
- (speaks Chinese)
(mimics Chinese)
Huh?
As Sun Lo says, all things have two prices, one for the foolish.
You know, you look so young but you talk so old. How come?
In a junk from Sanchow.
No, I meant how come... Oh, well.
I guess we don't talk the same language in more ways than one.
You've been so nice, I'll buy you something.
What shall it be?
Come on, what would you like?
A soup bone.
- A what?
- A soup bone.
For my dog. He's awful hungry.
You'll never get ahead in life if you go around asking for bones.
Do you think your mother would mind if you joined us in a soup bone?
- I haven't gotten a mother.
- Oh.
- Well, your father, or family?
- I haven't any family.
- I haven't even got Chang.
- Who's Chang?
He brought me from Sanchow, and then he ran away with my money.
Oh, a lady in distress?
Just my specialty. Well, you come along with us to lunch then you can tell me all about it.
- Thank you, but I couldn't eat any lunch.
- Why not?
Cos I haven't had breakfast yet.
(honks horn)
Menu, please.
There's the menu up there.
No, it's all Greek to me.
No, it's Chinese.
Well, go ahead and order for Mr Wu and your Uncle Tommy.
All right.
(speaks Chinese)
(speaks Chinese)
Those things cost a lot.
Have you got enough money?
- Too much, so I'm told.
- (speaks Chinese)
I told him to make it two soup bones.
- Do you live here, Uncle Tommy?
- No, just here today. My boat sails tonight.
- Going home?
- No, just travelling around.
- No place in particular.
- You must be an orphan too.
Unfortunately not.
You mean you don't like your father and mother?
Well, it seems we get along better with a couple of thousand miles between us.
So, there they are and here I am, and everybody's happy.
More or less.
There you are, Mr Wu.
You certainly are extravagant, Ching-Ching.
Thank you.
What's "stravagant" mean, Uncle Tommy?
- That means you're pretty nice.
- Then I think you're stravagant too.
I promised to pick up some friends here but first I'll get you straightened out.
- Will you wait?
- Sun Lo says patience is like wealth.
Many talk about it, but few possess it.
- Sun Lo is quite a conversationalist.
- I don't know, but he talks a lot.
Aw!
(honks horn)
Ah, hail to the chief!
- Hello, Tommy.
- Kay.
- Tommy, darling.
- Dora.
- Colonel, have you been drinking?
- A mere aperitif, a soupçon of brandy.
- Yes, master?
- Bring us flagons of your rarest nectar.
And bring it with the speed of an antelope.
We perish, we swoon.
Yes, master. Black Label all round?
- Right.
- Not for me.
Do these old ears hear right?
Could it be Thomas, the pride of the Randalls, has refused a drink?
- Right.
- My boy, are you ill?
Uh-uh. In fact, Colonel,
I am still under the spell of a good woman.
(barks)
Mr Wu! Mr Wu!
You come back here this very minute.
Mr Wu!
Mr Wu! Mr Wu!
Now, where did you find this good woman?
I didn't know there were any more left.
Come on outside. I'll introduce you, but remember, I saw her first.
- What about us? Can't we go too?
- Sure, come on. It'll do you good.
Now, none of your Rabelaisian lip.
This girl has led a very sheltered life.
As if I ever said anything that would raise a faint blush on the cheek of...
Looks like she stood you up.
Nice goings-on, I must say.
Here she is. Hey.
Why don't you go all the way in?
Maybe she's down the cellar.
- That's funny.
- At least she left you the car.
- Sometimes they don't even do that.
- She must be someplace.
- Come on, let's go on in.
- When you find her, yell. We'll be at the bar.
Now, let her go, lad. Better fish in the sea.
You know, this reminds me of an experience I had in Kansas City.
I met this little lady.
Very fine and very demure.
Mr Wu, you oughta be ashamed.
(thunder)
(Tommy hums a tune)
- Just like a lullaby, eh, Colonel?
- Hmm.
A Chinese lullaby.
- Oh, there you are, Mr Randall, sir.
- Little Lord Fauntleroy.
- Go away. I don't want to talk to you.
- Your car. We must get it aboard.
- The captain's holding up the boat, sir.
- All on account of you, Atkins.
You're a heedless, thoughtless butterfly.
No consideration for others. No...
I thought so.
Colonel, this man's been drinking.
Please, sir, we must hurry, sir. Now, please.
See here.
- Steady, Atkins, steady.
- Now, Tommy, we mustn't be too harsh.
I used to have an uncle that drank.
It's a madness in the blood.
Please, sir, I can walk for myself, sir.
You'll be all right, but you mustn't shout like that.
We'll get you back on the boat safe and sound.
It's quite all right.
I can really get there myself.
- It's quite all right.
- Get in there.
- Get in, Tommy, and hold him there.
- No, sir, I'm not drunk, I assure you.
- Are you sober enough to drive?
- Look out.
(ship's whistle)
(Mr Wu yaps)
- I could've sworn I heard something.
- I bet it's a stowaway.
Who's there?
If there's anybody down here, let's find them.
(rattling)
You search behind the sacks. You too.
You check behind the cars.
Steward! Steward!
We found a stowaway in the hold, but he got away.
Very well.
Jenkins, spread a general alarm.
We seem to have stowaways aboard.
At once, sir.
(bell)
Come in.
- Right there, steward.
- Yes, missy.
You were told to watch for stowaways before we sailed.
- I did, sir.
- Well, if we find one, you'll be out of a job.
You can come back for these things in half an hour, steward.
And, mind you, he was only 12.
Richard spoke up as quick as a flash, and what do you think he said, Susan?
"You may use my bicycle, Geraldine."
"I love sport, but I love the principles of manhood more."
- I'm afraid I'm boring you.
- Oh, I'm sorry, Mrs Hope.
- Richard told me that story three times.
- I tell it not because Richard is my son.
I tell it merely because I believe that you, as his future wife, might be interested.
Apparently, I was mistaken.
Mark my words, Susan, the time will come when you'll be just as devoted to Richard...
But I am devoted to him. Only...
Only you have a peculiar way of demonstrating your devotion.
Who is in there?
(Mr Wu growls)
(screams)
Help! Help!
- Help!
- What happened?
- There's a man in there.
- What's up?
- The stowaway.
- He growled at me.
- (door rattles)
- Come out.
Come out of there or I'll blow you out.
Well, I'll be...
- Aw, the poor little thing. We frightened her.
- She's frightened us.
- What's your name?
- In Chinese or American?
What?
In American it's Barbara Stewart.
But in Chinese it's Ching-Ching.
- What are you doing here?
- Hiding.
Hiding? Why?
The man said I was a stowaway.
- Well, are you?
- I... I guess so. What's a stowaway?
- How did you ever get on this ship, anyway?
- I don't know.
I never heard of such a thing in all my life.
I can't understand it.
- Neither can I.
- Oh, please don't be impertinent.
- She didn't mean to be. Did you, dear?
- No, I didn't.
- What's all this?
- We found the stowaway.
- Where is he?
- It's a she, sir.
It's this child here.
What, you?
I guess so.
She doesn't even know how she got aboard.
- What am I gonna do with you, young lady?
- I'll look after her.
- Susan, don't be absurd.
- She won't be any trouble.
Fine, Miss Parker. Bring her to my quarters after lunch and we'll have a talk with her.
- You can return to your post now, Jenkins.
- Aye, sir.
See you later, stowaway.
(Mr Wu barks)
Captain, can we put this... animal in the kennel?
Oh!
They'll take good care of it.
You'll give it a big dinner.
Why, of course I will. Here.
Don't you worry, I'll take care of it.
It isn't an it, sir. It's a him.
I've never had a dress as nice as this.
The ship's store is full of them.
All you have to do is get this one dirty and we'll find you another one.
Do you think your mother will like me better now I look beautiful?
- Mrs Hope isn't my mother.
- No?
Well, that is, not yet.
- See?
- Yes, I see.
It's time we turned the child over to the captain.
After all, charity has its limits.
What did you mean when you said you didn't know how you got on this ship? You must.
But I don't, honestly.
The last thing I remember is that I fell asleep in Uncle Tommy's car.
Uncle Tommy? Tommy who?
Randall. Tommy Randall.
- (both) Tommy Randall!
- Mm-hm.
- Your Uncle Tommy is on board this ship.
- He is?
I might've known you were his niece.
- He's a problem child too.
- I'll take you to him, Ching-Ching.
Considering his reputation, you'd better turn her over to the captain.
Very well.
Well, it seems odd, but with Mr Randall, nothing surprises me.
- Good morning, Captain.
- Good morning, Atkins.
- We'd like to see Mr Randall.
- Mr Randall's still asleep, sir.
- Well, it's about time he got up.
- Mr Randall never gets up until two, sir.
(laughs) I'm sorry, but this is important, so you'd better call him.
- Mr Randall will be very annoyed, sir.
- Tell him a pretty lady wants to see him.
- If I know Tommy Randall, that'll get him up.
- Yes, I'm afraid it will, sir.
Won't you be seated, please?
- I beg your pardon, sir.
- (snoring)
- I beg your pardon, sir!
- Go away, Fauntleroy.
Sorry, but there's a young lady to see you.
- Huh?
- There's a young lady to see you.
I think it's rather urgent.
- That's bad.
- She's very beautiful, sir.
Oh?
- Well, that's not so bad.
- She has a child with her, sir.
Oh, that is bad.
She also has the captain with her.
He insists on seeing you.
That's very bad.
Here you are, sir.
- What's that?
- Your chequebook, sir.
Oh...
I don't know what your game is, but I never saw you before.
I have witnesses to my whereabouts for the past 27 years.
- Mr Randall!
- Uncle Tommy!
Ching-Ching. What on earth...? Please forgive me, I'm awfully sorry. I'm not quite awake yet.
What are you doing on this boat?
I'm a stowaway, but I didn't mean to be.
- I waited in your automobile like you said.
- But I went out and looked for you.
Well, you see, after a while, it started to rain.
So I got in the back and pulled the cover down.
Oh, you poor kid.
- I'm awfully sorry.
- But I like being a stowaway, Uncle Tommy.
This is Susan Parker, my best friend.
He's my best friend too.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
- Don't you think she's stravagant?
- She's magnificent.
Oh, thank you.
- Charming little niece you have, Mr Randall.
- I'm not really his niece, Susan.
- He's just pretending.
- Why...?
- But aren't you the child's uncle?
- No.
We met in Shanghai yesterday.
- Oh, Ching-Ching, you told me...
- I didn't mean to tell a fib.
I was just scared, and I knew
Uncle Tommy would help me.
You know I will. I'm sorry, Captain, to have caused all this trouble.
I'll accept full responsibility.
I'll be only too glad to pay for her passage.
I'll have to communicate with her people.
From what she tells me, she has no people.
In fact, she has all the earmarks of a waif.
But she must have someone.
She didn't live in China by herself.
I lived with the Kruikshanks, but they won't care if I stay here.
- Who are the Kruikshanks, dear?
- They're missionaries in Sanchow.
Make a note of that name and get in touch through the American consul.
In the meantime, I'll look after her.
This time, I really mean it.
I'm inclined to think that Miss Parker is better company for the child.
Oh, he's good company too.
Maybe you had better go with Miss Parker.
You can call her Susan like I do.
Can't he, Susan?
Well, I suppose so.
I'll see you later, then, Ching-Ching.
- And I hope you too... Susan.
- Thank you.
- Bye, Uncle Tommy.
- Goodbye, darling.
Goodbye, Uncle Tommy.
Goodbye, Uncle Tommy.
Uncle Tom's cabin.
(ship's whistle)
- I can't understand it, Atkins.
- Understand what, sir?
Your gross neglect of your duties.
The most beautiful girl in the world is on this ship and you never told me.
Begging your pardon, sir, but you don't usually have to be told.
- Who is she?
- You met her mother on Monday night.
- I did?
- Unhappily, sir.
I...
- I didn't...?
- You did, sir.
Let me have it, Atkins.
You emptied a bottle of champagne in her lap, sir.
Oh!
(meows)
(mimics a train whistle)
Ding, ding!
(mimics train whistle)
Ding, ding!
Now, now, come, come, Atkins.
You can do better than that.
- You're not even trying.
- I thought it was rather good, sir.
Perhaps you can suggest something else that I can imitate better.
Well, let me see...
- Sleepy?
- Mm-hm.
It's not ten yet. You'll never be popular if you fold up right after dinner.
Begging your pardon, sir, but I think it's customary for little children to retire rather early.
- Is it really your bedtime, Ching-Ching?
- Mm-hm.
- Atkins, prepare Miss Ching-Ching for bed.
- Me, sir?
- I don't know anything about children.
- I've never...
- There's a first time for everything.
- Sir, this is very awkward.
Please, Uncle Tommy, I can undress myself.
I always do.
- I wish I could say the same.
- Oh, thank you, Miss.
Now, you close your eyes. Come on.
Atkins, a lullaby for Miss Ching-Ching.
- A what, sir?
- A lullaby.
- You know, a vocal Mickey Finn.
- Sir, I can't sing a lullaby.
You're one of the most untalented persons
I've ever met.
Can't do imitations or sing.
How do you ever entertain your friends?
- I can try, sir.
- Very well, start crooning.
One, two...

- Is she asleep?
- (Ching-Ching) Not yet.
Well, you should be.
- Good night, darling.
- Good night, Aunt Susan.
- Good night, Uncle Tommy.
- Good night, darling.
Good night, Atkins.
You've been very sweet to that child,
Mr Randall. Good night.
Good night? Don't tell me you go to bed at ten o'clock too?
- Let me see you to your room.
- It's only four doors away.
Still, let me come with you.
You might meet somebody.
Footpads, thugs, people like that.
It's not safe for a girl to be out alone after dark on the ocean.
(jazz band plays) it's beautiful.
Yes, beautiful.
And so peaceful.
- Peaceful too.
- It's really almost overdone, isn't it?
The moonlight on the water.
Stars in the sky. Music.
They might've at least had the decency to omit the music.
Yes, everything is here. Including you.
And me. Taken all together, that spells romance.
- Not for me.
- Why not?
- Romance takes two.
- We've got two here.
Yes, but not the right two.
You see, I'm engaged.
Oh...
To Richard Hope. Mrs Hope's son, you know.
- Yes, I know.
- He's meeting the boat at Bangkok.
- We're to be married there.
- Mm-hm? And why Bangkok?
He lives there. He's with an exporting firm.
- Exporting what?
- Oh, ivory, apes, peacocks.
Things like that. He came out here two years ago and he's worked very hard.
You mean to say you've been engaged for two years and you haven't seen him in that time?
You Latins.
What a hot-blooded race you are!
Well, Richard isn't quite like that. We've known each other since we were children.
Oh, I see.
Well, I must say, it all sounds very lyrical.
- Well, it may not be exactly lyrical.
- Me, of course, I've never been engaged.
Not definitely, that is.
- But if I were to be...
- Not definitely is right.
I seem to recall something in the newspapers:
"Millionaire playboy sued for breach of promise."
I practically won that suit.
She only got $10,000.
Poor kid, she'd been counting on 50.
That's more than Richard earns in a year.
Well, you shouldn't be so narrow. After all,
I can't help it if I've been cursed with wealth.
Not that it isn't as nice a curse as anyone could ask for.
- Have you ever worked for a living?
- Pardon?
You know, work. Like most people do.
Oh, work. Of course. I've worked my father...
Why should I take a job from someone else who needs it?
I sacrifice myself for the good of humanity. See?
Do you know what you are?
No, but I have a feeling that you're about to tell me.
A museum piece. You should be in a glass case in an exhibit of the terrible Twenties, cocktail shaker in your hand, shirt scrawled with chorus girls' telephone numbers, and a label - "Playboy BC, Before The Crash, former habitat, Broadway, now extinct."
Hmm...
You don't exactly pull your punches, do you?
Would it please you to know that I feel about that high and six years old?
You should grow up.
That's what I've been trying to tell you.
Oh, but forget it. At least forget it for now.
I'm really not a reformer always.
Anyway, beneath that too-smooth exterior beats a heart of gold... I think.
- It's beating awfully fast right now.
- Good night.
(band plays "Goodnight, My Love")
Sing it. There's no one here but you and me.
And the China Sea.
But it's a love song.
Just doesn't fit the occasion.
That's all right. It's only a popular song.
You didn't write the words.
- I'm warning you, if you don't sing it, I will.
- You win.

- How long do we have here, Purser?
- 12 hours, ma'am.
- This would be nice for the little girl.
- Do you like that?
- I think it's beautiful.
- All right, we'll take that too.
When I get big, I'm gonna marry a man like you. Aren't you, Aunt Susan?
When you grow up, there aren't gonna be any men like him.
He's a dying race, the last of the easy spenders.
Nice jade bracelet for the lady?
- No, thank you.
- What a perfect piece of jade.
- It is lovely.
- It's all yours. Wrap it up.
- Send to the steamer with the rest.
- Tommy, I couldn't accept it.
It's all right, Susan. Mr and Mrs Kruikshank are good people, and they take anything.
Shoes, potatoes, rice.
See, if Ching-Ching says it's all right.
- Not even for Ching-Ching.
- All right, but you're being very silly.
- You know where we're going now?
- Back to the boat.
- She guessed wrong again, didn't she?
- You said it.
- We're going to a show.
- What kind of a show?
Beautiful, magnificent.
- (knocking)
- Come in.
- Mother!
- Richard!
Why did you cable me?
Where's Susan? She's not ill, is she?
- Go up on deck and call Miss Parker.
- Yes, missy.
No, Richard, she's not ill.
Why did you send for me?
After all, it's not exactly an inexpensive trip.
I know, I know, dear, but frankly the situation was more than I could cope with alone.
What do you mean?
Heavens, Mother, don't build it up.
Did you ever hear of a man named Tommy Randall?
Randall? The name's familiar.
- It should be. It's in the papers enough.
- What about him?
- He's on this boat.
- What's that got to do with Susan?
Richard, your mother's a woman of the world. You realise that. She can tell...
She can tell what?
Heavens, Mother, we're not getting anyplace.
I'm not saying there's been anything wrong between them.
So that's it?
I've flown here just to be told Susan is having a harmless little ship flirtation?
It may be harmless, and it may not.
After all, Richard,
Susan's a very headstrong young woman.
Well, marriage will straighten her out.
Wait till she hears
I'm the new assistant manager in Bangkok.
JB - JB Bradley, I mean - gave me the promotion as a wedding present.
Just think. My boy, an assistant manager.
Why, Richard, it seems only yesterday that you were in curls.
- It shows what hard work, determination...
- (knocking)
Come in.
Too sorry. Missy has go shoreside.
- Ashore?
- Yes, missy.
Thank you.
You see? She's with Randall now.
I knew I was right in cabling you.
A mother's instinct never fails.
- What do you think I should do?
- The first thing to do is to find her.
Oh, look at the Chinese Major Bowes.
That fellow, Li Ze Mon, used to run a chop suey place on Broadway.

He wants the people in the audience to get up and give imitations.
He says there's a prize of ten yuan.
Where are you going?
If I get the ten yuan, then I can buy some presents for you and Uncle Tommy.
- Ching-Ching, no.
- Nothing can happen to her.
Oh, hello. What can I do for you?
- You can give me the ten yuan.
- (laughter)
You likee sing song?
- I will if you don't start ringing that bell.

You know, I think that's why that other gentleman quit.

(laughs)
Hello, Uncle Tommy! Hello, Aunt Susan!
- I think you'd better put her down.
- There might be more water farther on.
- Richard! This is a surprise.
- Yes, it's a surprise for me too.
Uh... Tommy, Mr Randall, this is Mr Hope.
- And Miss Ching-Ching Stewart.
- Pleased to meet you.
- I never thought I'd see you here.
- Evidently not.
- Weren't you surprised to see him?
- Hardly. I sent for him.
That's marvellous. I love surprises, and usually I never get them.
- Susan, I think your friends will excuse you.
- I'm sorry, I must be going now.
- You be awfully careful of her.
- She'll be perfectly all right.
- I'm sorry if I...
- That's all right.
- Goodbye, Ching-Ching.
- Goodbye.
- You like her, don't you?
- You could call it that.
I don't see how anybody can have fun with that Mr Hope.
I'm afraid fun isn't everything, Ching-Ching.
Come on, we're gonna have a good time.
(speaks Chinese)
- Me likee see one nice piecee tapestry.
- This way, please.
- Something like this, sir?
- No.
Let me see that one.
(yapping)
Not bad.
You precious little puppy, you.
You're just like Waify.
- Thank you, sir.
- Come on, Ching-Ching.
(speaks Chinese)
(speaks Chinese)
(speaks Chinese)
- He went that way.
- Thank you.
(speaks Chinese)
Well, Ching-Ching, where do we go from here?
Hey, where'd you come from?
Ching-Ching! Ching-Ching!
(speaks Chinese)
No, wait, this is all a mistake.
Listen, be reasonable. Ching-Ching!
There you are, darling.
(speaks Chinese)
- (speaks Chinese)
- Wait. Give me a chance to explain.
If wishes were keys, there would be no prisoners.
So Sun Lo says.
Good old Sun Lo, always brightening the corner where he isn't.
It's been fun up till now, but it won't be so funny if we miss that boat.
- I bet the captain will be pretty mad.
- He must be, or he'd be here by now.
We've gotta get out of here.
Well, I guess we'll have to start a rebellion.
Pardon me, would any of you gentlemen be interested in getting out of this jail?
I said...
You speak to them.
Tell them about the great outside world.
- Ask them how they'd like to see it again.
- (speaks Chinese)
(speaks Chinese)
Well?
They're not interested.
They said they like it here.
That's absurd. Where's their spirit?
Ask them are they men or are they mice?
(they speak Chinese)
Mice.
Well, at last. Sorry to have caused you so much trouble, Captain.
Now, see here, son.
I've been very lenient with you.
But there's a limit. You've overstepped it.
If it weren't for this child, I wouldn't be here.
- Any news about Ching-Ching?
- Sorry, Miss, not a word.
- Oh, I never should've left her with him.
- He should've known better.
It's an outrage taking a child of that age out at night in a city like Hong Kong.
Anything could happen.
(both) ♪ indeed I do

(drunkenly) Tommy, lad!
To the rescue. I need you.
(Kay) We missed you, darling.
(Dora) Did you have a good time?
We missed not having you, darling.
- Tommy, it was such a nice party.
- Glad you enjoyed yourselves.
Just the little matter of a taxi fare.
Could I impose on you?
- Don't tell me you've been robbed again.
- Clean.
Miss Parker. Miss Parker, here they come.
That's better. Nine and two are eleven.
Four and three are seven.
He thought I didn't have a card.
I trumped his ace.
You should've seen his face.
It was on a redouble.
- They play a lot of bridge in Bangkok?
- Great bridge town. We call it Bridgeport.
No, you're really very fortunate moving in with our crowd.
Only last week, JB - JB Bradley, I mean - said to me, "Dick." Calls me Dick for short.
"Dick," he said, "I'm sure your missis is gonna like it here."
- You will, too.
- Oh, I know I will.
- Tell her about the house, Richard.
- Oh, yes.
But just a description of it doesn't do it justice.
It's absolutely modern. Lots of closet space.
Fully equipped laundry. It's just as good as any house in any American suburb.
And roomy too. I'll show you.
Kinda L-shaped. This is our room.
- This is Mother's room.
- Mother's?
Yes. Oh, you think she'd be better off in this one?
(Richard) I don't know.
Bangkok is a very romantic city, isn't it?
There are a lot of old temples and places like that.
But our colony doesn't bother with the native things.
We have our own little set. Fine, substantial people too. Bridge and tennis.
You know your opponents so well you can tell in advance every move.
That must be interesting.
Susan! Susan!
You should be taking a nap, you and your dolls.
My dolls are. Shut your eyes and put out your hand. I've something for you.
All right.
- Susan, where did that come from?
- From Uncle Tommy.
- Who?
- Oh, I asked him not to buy it.
Look, he bought me a bracelet too.
- Why, that must've cost...
- $300. I saw the price tag.
$300! He wouldn't have spent that much money if he hadn't felt you were interested.
- I don't think I need even answer that.
- You'll return it, won't you?
Certainly. I asked Mr Randall not to buy it.
- Shall I give back my bracelet too?
- No, darling.
I think you'd better go take your nap or play or something.
Still, he might've meant it as a wedding present.
In that case, there'd be no harm in your keeping it. After all, it did cost quite a lot.
Will my boy be happy with a girl like that?
- Sometimes I wonder.
- Of course I will, Mother.
- Why do you say that?
- Oh, I don't know.
Susan seems to have changed a great deal lately.
She'll be all right after we're married.
Well, it's about time we declared an armistice.
I've been feeling terrible, Susan.
Well, this is very pretty, but of course I can't accept it.
Take back your baubles, is that it?
Listen, Susan, I think you're being very...
What, is it as bad as all that?
- Don't you like me any more?
- That has nothing to do with it.
Well, don't you?
Not particularly.
You know what you tell me: keep your chin up and you'll be OK.
As Sun Lo says, the strongest man in the world cannot lift a heavy heart.
Why is your heart heavy?
You know that Mr Hope?
Well, Susan's gonna marry him.
Oh!
She'll have Mrs Hope for a mother-in-law.
It'll serve her right, too.
Oh, no! Nobody should have
Mrs Hope for a mother-in-law.
Ah, there you are, young lady.
Just the one I want to see.
I've got a surprise for you.
As an unshelled nut is to a squirrel, so is a surprise to him who receives it.
Righto, darling.
You're going to leave the ship at Singapore.
What?
Now, you run down below and start to get ready.
Then when you come back,
I'll tell you the rest.
You oughta give Uncle Tommy a surprise too, just to make him feel better.
- He's been in the... What was it?
- Doghouse.
With Mr Wu.
- What is all this?
- I just received this wireless from Shanghai.
- What will the consul do with her?
- There's a home for girls in Shanghai.
- He'll probably see she's placed in it.
- Home for girls?
You mean grey uniforms and pigtails?
Ching-Ching was never meant for that.
I know, old man, but I'm afraid it's about all that can be done for her.
Captain, wait a minute.
This may sound crazy, but why can't I adopt her?
Now, see here, son.
You're a bachelor. And quite a bachelor.
No court would turn a child over to you.
- It would be different if I were married?
- Well, naturally.
- It's a horrible step.
- I don't think you need worry, old man.
You haven't got time now.
- Excuse me. Have you seen Ching-Ching?
- Yes.
- Do you know where she is?
- Yes.
Well, would you mind telling me?
Below, getting ready to leave the ship at the next stop.
They're putting her in a home for girls.
She'll be marching in lockstep and eating gruel within a week.
- I hope you like it.
- Oh, Tommy.
- Tears won't help.
- But surely something can be done.
This can't happen to Ching-Ching.
I don't know.
Wait a minute.
You're gonna marry old sourpuss, aren't you?
- I beg your pardon?
- Sorry, no of fence meant.
Look, I tried to adopt Ching-Ching, but I'm unmarried.
- You're getting married.
- Richard might...
- You don't want her to go to an institution?
- Of course not.
Then listen.
I've gone completely soft about that kid.
Incredible, I know, but true.
Adopt her. Let me pay for her upbringing until I can take her myself.
That'll be as quick as I can get to the States and come back with a wife.
Will you do it? It wouldn't be for long.
You may not believe it, but there are quite a few girls back home willing to marry me.
At least there used to be.
It's not for me, it's for Ching-Ching.
- I'll do it.
- I knew you would.
May I speak to you, Susan?
- Pardon me.
- Certainly.
Susan, I'm awfully sorry if I annoyed you in speaking of that bracelet as I did.
Imagine my becoming so upset over a mere trinket. Absurd, isn't it?
Oh, I was a little upset myself. I'm sorry.
There, that's better. Everything's all right now.
Here we are, the three happy Hopes.
One, two, three, and away we go.
Mother was a little weepy when you stalked out.
Somehow she got the idea you'd prefer her not to live with us.
- Why, whatever could've given her that idea?
- I don't know.
But I told her we couldn't get along without her. Didn't I, Mother?
- Well, I don't suppose we could.
- That's awfully sweet of you, Susan.
Heaven protect us all from interfering mothers-in-law is what I always say.
Goodness. I was married myself once and I know what I'm talking about.
Not that Mr Hope's mother didn't mean well, but then, you know... young love.
We do know, don't we?
- Richard.
- Yes?
Just one thing.
Well, I want to adopt little Ching-Ching as soon as we're married.
Whoever heard of such a thing?
If I don't, they'll put her in an institution.
- That's what institutions are for.
- Oh, Richard, please.
I'm sure Richard doesn't want to start his married life with a ready-made family.
Especially with a child called Ching-Ching.
It won't be for long, just until Mr Randall gets back.
- Randall? What's he got to do with it?
- Well... You see, it's a favour to him.
He wants to adopt her as soon as he can.
When he gets back to the States, he'll arrange to take her.
- Why should I do Mr Randall a favour?
- Why indeed?
It isn't for him, it's for the little girl.
Think of her future.
Don't meddle with other people's destinies, my dear.
Forget this child. She got along before she met you and she will after she leaves you.
Dismiss her from your mind completely.
Please, don't you think Richard and I should settle this by ourselves?
After all, it concerns us.
Anything that concerns Richard concerns me.
I think Mother's right, Susan.
- You do?
- Yes.
- Your mother's right and I'm wrong?
- Well, yes. That is, I think you're mistaken.
So do I. I've been mistaken about you and me.
- Now, Susan...
- Listen, marriage is for two people.
I'm breaking our engagement.
Richard, she'll come back.
Meanwhile you wait.
The man should always wait, otherwise he's weak.
Ching-Ching! Ching-Ching!
Goodbye, Uncle Tommy.
The captain says I have to go.
No, you don't.
Didn't you say she could be adopted by someone who's married? She's going to be.
- Here she is now.
- Oh, darling.
- Don't I have to go ashore?
- Not now. Tell her, Susan.
- Miss Parker's going to adopt Ching-Ching.
- I'm not going to be married.
- What? Oh, but you said...
- I think we'd better go now, darling.
Just a minute.
This isn't really goodbye.
I'll come back for you real soon.
And in the meantime, you won't cry, will you?
No, Uncle Tommy, but remember, one... one minute of waiting is a century to the hopeful.
I'll remember, Ching-Ching.
Goodbye, sweetie.
If you ever come back again, you won't forget to come and see me, will you?
- I'll be in the orphan asylum in Shanghai.
- Oh, sure, we'll look you up.
- Won't we?
- Of course we will.
Maybe we'll have some more fun like we had.
We might even go back to jail again.
(Tommy) Yes, we might.
Well, I think I'd better run along now.
Before I really cry. Goodbye.
We can't let this happen to her.
Look, Susan, I've got an idea.
Please don't say no till you hear me out.
I know exactly what you think of me, but that isn't important now.
Marry me. Don't misunderstand me.
You wouldn't have to put up with me.
It'd just be a marriage in name only.
Soon as we dock in San Francisco, go to Reno and get a divorce.
My lawyers will take care of everything.
I wish you would. For Ching-Ching.
It's the only way.
- You'd really do that for her?
- I'd do anything in the world for her.
- So would I.
- Then you will?
Yes.
Hey, bring her back.
- What's that?
- We're getting married. We want to adopt her.
Come on, Ching-Ching, darling.
We're going back aboard ship again.
For as much as Susan Parker and Thomas Randall have consented together in holy wedlock, and have witnessed the same before this company, and have given and pledged their troth, each to the other, and have declared the same by giving and receiving a ring and joining hands,
I pronounce that they are man and wife.
Amen.
- All happiness, my dear. Good luck, my boy.
- Thank you.
Twice blessed is he who loves both bride and groom, for their happiness is his.
Congratulations, Mr Randall.
Much joy to you, Mrs Randall.
- Thank you.
- A sailor's knot is as good as City Hall's.
There'll be some formalities about the child.
I'll have my lawyer take care of that.
- Susan, why did you do this?
- Young man, you're talking to my wife.
- Richard, dear!
- And you told me to wait.
- Are you really and truly my parents now?
- We're the best you've got, darling.
Sun Lo says a child without parents is like a ship without a rudder.
Sun Lo ever say anything about going to sleep?
Oh, yes.
He said sleep without dreams is given to children for their innocence and old men for their wisdom.
Well, off you go, then.
I'm almost too excited to sleep, but I'll try.
- Good night, sweetie.
- Good night, Aunt Susan, Uncle Tommy.
Good night, darling, but I'm not your uncle any more.
- What are you, then?
- Can't you guess?
I know. You're my father now.
- Night, Dad.
- Good night, honey.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Well, here you are.
Did the stewardess move your things?
She said Mrs Hope almost bit her.
- I...
- I...
- Go ahead.
- No, you.
Well, I was just going to say if there was anything you wanted me to do to lend credibility to the situation,
I'll be glad to do it, you know.
- People will talk whatever we do.
- Sure, of course.
Well, I guess I'll be off.
I don't know how to thank you.
I'll try to make things as easy for you as possible.
I'm cabling my lawyers tonight. You can go direct to Reno as soon as the boat docks.
- Everything's arranged.
- Very thoughtful.
Not at all. You'll like Reno.
It's a fascinating place.
Lots of fresh air and horseback riding.
Full of nice, emotional people.
Oh...
- This is the address you go to.
- Thank you.
You're really wonderful.
I suppose you know that.
Well, at the moment,
I don't feel very wonderful.
Well, if you must know,
I don't feel so good myself.
- Good night, Susan.
- Good night, Tommy.
I...
Begging your pardon, sir, where shall I lay out your pyjamas this evening?
- Where you laid them last night.
- Oh, dear. I'm so sorry, sir.
(knocking)
Come in.
Susan, why didn't you warn me you were going to do this?
Well, I... I didn't have time, and besides... (laughs) it's too late now.
- Well, it's hardly funny, is it?
- Not to me.
Well, tell me one thing.
You don't love him, do you?
Do you?
No, I don't, but even if I did it wouldn't make any difference.
Yes, it would. Listen, darling,
I've been a worm, I know that now.
But I've had an understanding with Mother.
You can have your way from now on, always, if you'll tell me there's a chance.
Oh, no, Richard.
It wouldn't work. You know it wouldn't.
You can be nice. You're nice now, but...
- Please, Susan.
- No, really, I'm too confused to talk about it.
I'm even too upset to think about it.
I'll follow you.
I'll follow you until you say yes.
No, Richard, I'd rather you didn't.
You'd better lock this.

- Is this Mrs Randall?
- Yes.
You mustn't be nervous when your case is called.
I've placed you at the beginning of today's calendar. Meanwhile, wait here.
That's awfully kind of you, Judge.
This is my first divorce, and I'm a little jittery.
It is a little strange at first, but they all get used to it.
- You know, like influenza.
- (knocking)
Come.
Right in here, please.
- Susan!
- Darling, I'm so glad to see you.
Oh, this is a surprise.
But I don't understand.
Well, you see, I thought
I might want another divorce sometime.
I was sort of curious to see how they made them.
(clears throat)
- Judge Booth, this is Mr Randall.
- The husband, I presume?
Yes. This is my daughter.
- Your daughter?
- Adopted.
- How are you, young lady?
- Fine, thank you.
To greet one you love is better for the health than medicine.
Well, I declare.
That sounds like a Chinese proverb.
Judge, you haven't heard anything yet.
Well, well, well.
Come over here and talk to me.
I... I tried to stay away, but I found I couldn't.
I had to see you again.
Suppose you and I have our talk in the other room.
Uh...
- Will you excuse us for a few moments?
- Oh, but would it be proper?
- I mean, our being left alone together now.
- Oh, it's quite customary.
- You're looking very well.
- I haven't had a drink in six weeks.
- That's wonderful.
- No, it isn't, it's terrible.
Still, I'll get along, and it does show what the influence of a good woman can do.
- Oh, really? Who is she?
- Ching-Ching.
I told you I'd do anything in the world for her.
You've proven that.
Honestly, you wouldn't know me.
I'm a changed man.
I may not be any better, but at least I'm different.
I'm so glad.
You know, you were right about Reno.
It's a fascinating place.
- So charming and...
- Susan. Darling.
- Oh, Tommy, please.
- Do we have to go through with this?
Richard is waiting in the courtroom to marry me. He's gonna take me back to the Orient.
Oh...
I see.
Well, I guess that's that, isn't it?
I'm sorry.
Sorrier than I can say.
Everyone rise.
Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye!
The District Court of Washoe,
State of Nevada, is now in session.
The Honourable JG Booth, judge presiding.
Be seated, please.
Case of Randall versus Randall.
- Any witnesses for plaintiff?
- The case is uncontested.
In that case, the court would like to call a witness of its own.
But the case is uncontested.
I said the court will call a witness of its own.
Miss Barbara Randall.
We don't want her mixed up in this.
The witness will take the stand.
The defendant will please be seated.
- Raise your right hand, please.
- I think we can dispense with the oath.
- Yes, Your Honour.
- Now, Miss Randall.
- You can call me Ching-Ching, Judge.
- Thank you.
Now, Ching-Ching, the plaintiff alleges general incompatibility.
Have you ever noticed evidence of such a condition existing between the parties to this action?
To my knowledge, the contestants in this action have manifested nothing but the most harmonious, cordial and friendly feelings towards each other.
- But, Your Honour, I object.
- Who are you, young man?
- Why, I'm engaged to the plaintiff.
- Engaged?
To a married woman?
- This court recognises no such engagement.
- (laughter)
Now, Ching-Ching, have either of the parties in this action ever evidenced by their conduct any proper legal ground for divorce?
There's utterly no ground for disturbing the marital status of the contestants.
Most irregular, Your Honour.
The child doesn't know what she is saying.
Oh, yes, she does.
Tell the court.
Isn't this action the result of two grown-up people behaving like children, refusing to admit that they're in love with each other?
The allegations of the complaint insofar as it refers to...
Uh...
Matrimony.
Huh?
- Matrimony.
- Oh, yes.
- Insofar as it refers to macaroni...
- (lawyer) Macaroni?
There! See, Your Honour?
The child has obviously been coached.
I was not. I just forgot what the judge told me to say.
- (laughter)
- (gavel)
- ls counsel intimating that she is lying?
- Counsel charges just that.
Have you any witnesses to disprove her testimony?
Do you wish to testify that this child was lying?
Why...
- No, of course not.
- Then you admit that you love Mrs Randall?
She knows I do.
You, Mrs Randall.
Do you wish to attack this child's veracity?
- Why, no, certainly not.
- You admit that you love your husband?
- Well, yes, I do.
- Then what's all this nonsense about?
Divorce denied. Take your child and go home, both of you, where you belong.
Your Honour, what about me?
My advice, young man, is to stop tampering with the affections of married women.
- Well, we did it, didn't we?
- You bet we did.
Judge, you're simply stravagant.

- Thank you. That will be all, Moses.
- Yes, ma'am.
May I have some of those cookies, Miss Virgie?
Of course you may.
James Henry.
Serve these cookies to Master Harold and wipe his chin.
Yes, ma'am, Miss Virgie.
Another portion of ice cream for you, Miss Gladys?
No, thank you, I've had enough.
There ain't no more ice cream, Miss Virgie.
I'll only ask them once. I won't coax.
More cake or ice cream for you,
Master Philip?
Nothing more for me, thank you.
Would you care for more ice cream,
Master Harold?
Yes.
Perhaps you would rather have another nice, great big piece of cake.
No,just ice cream.
Is this for me?
Course not.
Serve it to young Master Harold.
Seems like he could've just reached over and took it... instead of this roundabout way.
That child of yours is certainly the perfect hostess.
She takes after her mother.
I can easily understand why you two worship her.
I'm afraid that's a failing common to all parents.
Listen, everyone. Listen!
How would you like to see Uncle Billy dance?
All right,James Henry.
Let's get going, son.
James Henry?
How about you dancing too?
Oh, no, ma'am, Miss Virgie.
The body is willing, but the feet just stays too close to the ground.
Come, dear. Excuse yourself for a moment.
Some other little friends want to see you.
Will you please excuse me for a minute?
Yes, Miss Virgie.
Now, you took some gumption and talk right out to Miss Virgie. Don't be scared.
Hello, Sally Anne.
Hello, Dinah.
- Hello.
- Go on now, Sally Anne.
Miss Virgie...
Please, ma'am...
We all done come here to wish you many happy -
- happy-
- Returns.
That's it!
Many happy returns of the day.
And we all done made you a doll, and here it is.
Miss Virgie, there was more
I had to say, but-
Mammy, I forgot it.
You said everything, Sally Anne.
Don't you worry.
This is the very nicest present I got.
Thank you ever so much.
Yes, indeed, children. It was very thoughtful and sweet. Come now, dear.
I'll see you later, and I'll save you some cake.
We'll be waiting!
I hope you'll excuse me, Miss Virgie... if I don't bow very low, but these britches are too tight.
That's perfectly all right, Master Harold.
Just bow as far as you can.
That's far enough.
Be careful.
- Captain Cary?
- There's Cary.
- Here.
Fort Sumter was fired on this morning, sir.
War is declared.
You are to present yourself at the armory immediately, sir, with horse and sidearms.
All men of the Richmond Graves report in the city before nightfall.
Captain Cary, send a slave down the valley to report the news.
I'm riding north among the river plantations.
Thank you, sir.
Hurrah!
Come on, boy.
Listen, you get the children.
I'll meet you outside at the carriage.
Isn't this terrible?
What are we going to do?
- I reckon I'd better get your things together.
- I'll leave as soon as I can.
Mrs. Cary, I think we ought to get the children home.
- The road may be filled with soldiers before night.
- That's true.
We'll be mobilizing tonight and tomorrow.
- Tom, get the carriages ready as quickly as you can.
- Yes, ma'am.
Come on, darling.
We've got to hurry.
Good-bye, Miss Virgie.
Wait for me!
Bye, Miss Virgie.
Bye, Miss Virgie.
Take him right away, boss.
There you go. Come on! Come on!
- Good-bye, Mr. Cary.
- Good-bye.
Come on here,Jimmy.
Hold it.
Uncle Billy...
I don't think it was very polite to chase everybody out of my party like that.
Their mammies have to get 'em home quick.
You see, honey child, there's going to be a war.
What's a war?
Well, a war is a lot of soldiers and battles... where men kill each other with guns.
Really and truly kill each other?
- Yes, ma'am.
- Why?
Seem like to me, honey, no one knows why.
I hear a white gentleman say there's a man up North who wants to free the slaves.
What does that mean,
"free the slaves''?
I don't know what it means myself.
It's funny, isn't it?
There's Daddy! It's Daddy!
My daddy's the best soldier in the whole army.
Ready, halt!
Company, march!
Oh,James Henry, you always do it wrong.
I see the Yankees here last week.
When they say " march,'' they starts.
When they say " halt,'' they stops.
Well, that's just why I do it different.
I wouldn't do anything those Yankees do!
Look! Here they come again,
Miss Virgie! Look!
- Come on!
- Come on, Miss Virgie! They might hurt you!
- Come on, Miss Virgie.
- I'm not going to run.
- They's liable to hurt you.
- I just won't budge.
- I'll show them I'm not afraid.
- I is!
- Ain't you a speck afraid, Miss Virgie?
- No, I'm not.
What are you afraid of them for?
Oh, honey child, them Yankees is mighty powerful.
They can even change the weather.
- Yes?
- Whenever they come around...
I never know whether it's winter or summer.
I'm shiverin' and sweatin' at the same time.
- Go and tell Mother they're coming.
- I think I better.
Troops, halt!
Good Lord, Miss Virgie!
You is startin' another war!
- Who did that?
- I did.
- Well, you're truthful anyway.
- My mommy and daddy taught me never to tell a lie.
They're right. Who are you?
- I'm a Confederate.
- So you're a little rebel, eh?
I'm not a rebel. My daddy said so.
I'm a Confederate.
- Your daddy a soldier?
- He's the best soldier in the whole world.
- Is he around here now?
- I wouldn't tell you if he was.
Got a lot of spunk, haven't you?
- Well, I'm not afraid of you.
- Well, I'm glad you're not.
I think it'd be awful if a nice, little girl like you were afraid of me.
Nevertheless, you better mind your manners, young lady... and don't use that slingshot again.
 I wish I was in Dixie
Hooray, hooray 
 In Dixieland I'll take my stand 
 To live and die in Dixie
Away, away 
 Away down South in Dixie
Away, away 
 Away down South in Dixie 
- Mommy?
- Yes, Virgie.
When is Daddy coming to see us again?
Oh, we can't tell, darling. He's a long distance away, and it's not so easy as it was.
- Why isn't it?
- Because we're in enemy territory now.
What does " enemy territory'' mean?
Well, it means that the Yankees have captured this land, and it doesn't belong to us anymore.
And every time that Daddy comes to see us, he has to cross through the enemy lines... and that's very dangerous.
I can't understand it.
I say my prayers every night... and I say a special prayer for Daddy to come and see us... but it doesn't seem to do any good.
So yesterday I started praying in the daytime too.
I prayed twice yesterday, and I prayed three times today.
I'm sure it'll work now, Mommy.
Here comes Daddy!
It's Daddy!
- Massa Cary.
- Uncle Billy.
Tears?
Joy!
Me too, Daddy. Look.
Southerners never cry.
- Oh, what are these things then?
- Raindrops.
- On a sunshiny day? Aww!
- Ohh!
Can you stay long this time, Daddy?
Not this time either, darling.
I have to get right on.
I'll see if Rosabelle has your lunch ready.
- Are they getting a fresh horse for me?
- Everybody knows just what to do.
- We practice it every day.
- Oh, God love you!
Miss Virgie,
I brought you some water and a towel.
- I thought maybe Massa Cary would like to wash his face.
- Thank you,James Henry.
Didn't nobody tell me to do it either.
I thought of it all by myself.
Well, you must be thinking better than you used to,James Henry.
Yes, sir, Massa Cary.
I even think more often now.
-James Henry!
- Yes, Miss Virgie?
Didn't I tell you to bring this water?
That's right. It was you.
I thought it was Uncle Billy.
What was that I thunk up all by myself?
Oh, yes. I was gonna polish
Massa Cary's boots.
Didn't nobody tell me to do that, did they?
Never mind my boots,James Henry.
Go water my horse.
Yes, sir, Massa Cary.
Daddy?
Are we winning the war?
Well, things are going along.
- Will it last much longer?
- Mm, I hope not.
- Do you have to work hard in the war?
- We all have to do our share.
Every time I see you you're always so tired.
Well, I'm not tired now.
You're giving me new strength.
I miss you, Daddy.
Do you miss me?
Indeed I do.
You know when I miss you the most?
At twilight when you used to sing to me.
Let's pretend it's twilight now, Daddy.
Now, you just close your eyes and make out you're tired, and I'll sing to you now.
Why, I was humming in my sleep.
Aw, you were not!
Tom's bringing up another horse.
- That's fine. Oh, Tom?
- Yes, sir, Massa Cary?
- Give him some water and fill those saddlebags with oats.
- Yes, sir, Massa Cary.
I'll go to the stables for you, Daddy.
I can run faster.
I'd better get going while the coast is clear.
I've got to find out... where Sheridan's army's camping and report to General Lee before nightfall.
I'm so worried about you on these scouting expeditions.
If they catch you, you'll be shot as a spy.
As long as they don't find any dispatches on me, and I'm not wearing a Yankee uniform...
- I'd only be arrested as a prisoner of war.
- As if that weren't bad enough.
- Please be careful.
- You know I will.
- I'll push. It'll make you go faster.
- Oh, go on now.
- Go on, hurry!
- Oh!
- How is she, Uncle Billy?
- Oh, fine, Massa Cary. Fine, sir.
We's only got two left, but they both good, sir.
Two left?
Well, I've had to sell or trade nearly all the stock for food- that is, all that weren't stolen.
I've saved the horses till the last, knowing you might need them.
- Why didn't you tell me?
- This is the part of the war we women must fight, darling.
Push me!
I pushed the oats all the way from the stables, Daddy.
It's a wonder this lazy jackass didn't eat 'em up on the way.
Go on back to that stable, boy.
Yankees, Massa Cary!
Yankees! They's comin'!
Go ahead, son. I got him.
Good-bye, darling.
Don't be afraid.
Please be careful.
- Good-bye, honey.
- Oh, Daddy.
Come on, darling.
Daddy has to hurry.
Let's see you smile.
Oh, that's only a half o' one.
Come on now.
Give Daddy a grand, big fat smile.
Oh, that's fine.
Come on, Massa Cary.
Hurry, please, sir.
I'll try to cross the river the other side of the old mill. I can hide in the woods.
I'll fire three quick shots to let you know I'm safe.
Keep them here long as you can.
I'll need the time. Good-bye.
- God ride with you, darling.
- Oh, Daddy?
- Yes, dear?
- Give all my love to General Lee.
I will, honey.
Seth! Seth!
Where's them Yankees at?
They're just turning off the main road.
- Get that corn from the barn into the house.
- Yes, sir.
Quick!
I can carry two, Rosabelle.
There you is, child.
Come on, children.
Come on. Hurry.
- Are they in sight yet?
- No, ma'am, Missa Cary.
- Here, you put this away. I'll watch.
- Yes, ma'am.
Come on. Come on, hurry.
Uncle Billy!
Here they come!
Here they come!
Rosabelle, get in the drawing room and start sewing just like you surprised to see 'em.
- Yes, Uncle Billy.
- The rest of you, out in the stable, quick.
Uncle Billy, do you think the Yankees will find us in the secret room?
Don't you be a-scared, child.
There ain't nothing to worry about.
- There is somethin' to worry about if you's white.
- What you mean?
They won't hurt us, 'cause we's slaves.
They's fightin' for us.
But if you's white and Southern, then you's the enemy.
Oh, don't pay him no mind.
Go on, children. Get in there and hide.
All right, Uncle Billy.
Get in now. You too young to see anything that may happen.
- What's the matter, Miss Virgie?
- My dress is caught.
For a man they ain't gonna hurt... you do a powerful lot of shivering every time the Yankees comes around.
My mind says they ain't gonna hurt me, but my body don't believe it.
Aahh!
- Where's Missa Cary?
- I don't know. I ain't seen her.
- Stand up, you!
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
We're looking for a spy.
Is there a rebel hiding in this house?
No, sir. No, sir, Massa General.
Nobody at all, sir.
- Who lives here?
- Missa Cary, sir.
- Is she married?
- Yes, sir.
- Where's her husband?
- I-
- Is he a rebel?
- I-
- Is he a rebel?
- He's away in the war, sir.
In the Confederate Army?
- Yes, sir.
- Where is she?
She's around, but I don't know where, sir.
Search the house, men.
She's hiding someone.
- If she wasn't, she'd be here.
- Yes, sir. Come on, men.
Barnes, Lorny, Robinson, upstairs.
The rest of you men take the lower floor.
- Start in back. Mason, deploy all your men.
- Yes, sir.
- Bring me a drink.
- We ain't got nothin', sir, 'cepting apple cider.
- Well, bring me that.
- Yes, sir, Massa General.
- You, get me something to eat.
- We ain't got-
- Get me something to eat!
- I'll try, sir.
Here's something, men.
Keep it covered.
Yes, sir, I was just on my way out.
What were you doing in that closet?
I-I went in there to get me some air.
Oh, you go into a dark closet to get air, do you?
Yes, sir. You see, I'm a man who likes to change his air.
I gets tired of regular old air.
So every little once in a while,
I go in someplace... and get me some good closet air.
Come on, come on. Get out of here.
Search it, men.
- Nobody back there, sir.
- Any trapdoors in the floor?
- Couldn't find any, sir.
- Well, keep your eyes open.
- Yes, sir.
- Watch for secret panels.
These houses all have 'em.
- Why did you drop that pitcher?
- It just slipped off the tray, sir.
Slipped, eh? It slipped when I said something about secret panels.
- That's when it slipped, didn't it?
- I didn't hear you say it, sir.
- Now listen, you-
- Sergeant!
- Sergeant!
- Find anything?
These oats out in front, and the ground nearby was wet... as though a horse had been watered and the saddlebags filled.
These oats ain't been there 1 0 minutes.
The sun hasn't turned 'em yet.
Search the stables and rush some men down to the river near that old mill.
- That's where he'll cross ifhe gets away.
- Yes, sir.
Come on, boys.
Here, take this to the kitchen and get the general some more cider.
- Sergeant.
- Find anything?
- Nothing up there.
- There's a trapdoor in the kitchen.
I'm gonna find out what's under it.
- Did you find anything?
- Let's look around-
What are you doing glued to that wall?
You've been lying. Now, come on.
I've got something!
Look at this.
There must be somebody in there.
- It's a secret panel.
- It ain't nothing, sir.
- Open it.
- It's just a wall, sir.
- Bust it in.
- Wait a minute. I'll open it.
It's just two little babies in there.
That's all.
Well, this ain't much to get excited about.
Nothing to eat, eh? And no liquor?
Well, this is pretty good.
Hurry up.
Get out ofhere. Come on.
Come on. Get out of here.
Hurry up.
Get one of those hams and have it cooked.
- Yes, sir.
- You boys can get yourselves a couple of drinks too.
Yes, sir!
Ah, right down the scuppers.
Come here, you.
Pull off these boots.
Why, you little black rascal!
I'll tan your hide for this!
- Come here, you little rascal!
- You let me go! You let me go!
White, by gad!
Who told you to put that black on?
I guess your daddy told you to do it.
Your daddy's a soldier, isn't he?
Why, I wouldn't hurt a little girl like you.
Maybe you'll tell me where your daddy is.
I'd like to talk to him.
Come here, you!
- She didn't mean nothing, master.
- Don't you dare touch that child!
- Turn me loose!
- Mother! Mother!
- Run, Virgie, run!
- Let me go!
Mother! Mother!
I didn't mean to shove ya.
Don't you hurt my mother!
Don't you dare hurt my mother!
- You let her alone! Attention!
What's going on here?
Are you hurt, madam?
No.
- Who's in command here?
- I am, sir.
Do you know what he did?
He broke our table, and he wanted to hurt me, and he threw my mommy down the stairs.
Put that loot back where you got it.
- Lieutenant Harte.
- Yes, sir.
Take him outside and give him 25 lashes.
Beat him till he bleeds.
Investigate the others. If you find any of them guilty, give them five lashes each.
Yes, sir. Come on, Dudley.
I can't tell you how sorry I am, madam.
And you too, miss.
- Why, you were crying, weren't you?
- Not very much.
You look like you've been climbing up the chimney.
Your men were the cause of it.
Just wait till I tell my Daddy about this.
He'll go and kill your whole Yankee army!
And I won't blame him a bit.
Blow.
Thank you.
Now you run along and play.
There's a rebel scout, madam, known to be in this neighborhood.
I'm sorry to have to question you after what's already occurred, but it's necessary.
- I know nothing of him.
- I happen to know that you do. He's your husband.
- Have you seen him today?
- No.
Would you tell me if you had?
Would you expect me to?
I'm afraid not.
- What is it, Sergeant?
- We found a horse in a corral half a mile below here, sir.
Shows signs ofhaving been ridden hard a short while ago.
He changed horses here.
Send five men to the river.
Put two sharpshooters on the roof of that old mill so they can cover both banks.
Yes, sir.
What's that?
A godsend.
In that case, I'm afraid there's no longer any necessity for my staying.
Good day, madam.
And good day to you, you little rebel.
- Sergeant!
- Yes, sir?
Countermand that order.
He's already across.
- All right, we're going back to camp.
- Yes, sir.
Come in!
I don't think we should stay here a second longer, Missa Cary.
The Yankees is already down by the east pasture, and we's right in the line of fire.
You better hurry.
The shells is droppin' in the yard now.
Please, hurry.
Don't be afraid.
- Uncle Billy, can't we get to the slaves' quarters?
- No, ma'am.
They's firin' there now.
Excuse me, Captain.
One of your slaves is outside.
Wants to see you. He says it's very important.
- What? One of my slaves?
- Yes, sir.
- How could he have gotten through the Yankee lines? Send him in.
- Yes, sir.
Oh, Massa Cary, thanks the Lord I found you, sir.
- What is it, Uncle Billy?
- Missa Cary, she's awful sick, sir.
- Sick?
- Yes, sir. I's afraid, Massa Cary. I's afraid, sir.
She keeps asking for you all the time.
- What happened?
- Sir, they fought right in front of the house.
The house was burned down.
Missa Cary, she catch her death of cold.
She's coughing bad.
How long has this been going on?
She was sick for three weeks and gettin' worse.
Then I decided I better fetch you.
I been going from camp to camp looking for you for over a week now.
- Most of the slaves run away.
- And Virgie- How's little Virgie?
Oh, she's fine, sir.
Never complain about nothing and always cheerful.
She's been a great comfort to Missa Cary.
But I's afraid Missa Cary needs you now, sir.
- I'll get a leave of absence right away.
- Yes, sir.
I've got some logs in the river covered with brush.
We can float down past the Union camps, then cut inland 'cross through the Chickahominy Swamp.
- Well, hurry. We'll have to get into the swamp before daybreak.
- Yes, sir.
Here's the Union camp now, sir.
It's only an hour before daylight.
- Do you think we can do it, Massa Cary?
- Well, we can try. Come on.
You're feeling better now, aren't you, Mommy?
Yes, dear, much better.
I bet it won't be long before Daddy is here.
He'll make everything all right.
You'll see.
We-We mustn't be too sure, darling.
Then we won't be so disappointed if he doesn't get here.
Perhaps Uncle Billy didn't get through the Yankee lines.
Uncle Billy can do anything.
He can sing and dance and climb trees... and do everything in the world.
I know he can bring Daddy back.
Now, I have my housework to do... so you just lie quiet until I finish.
Mother's very proud of you, darling.
I'll be right back.
Rosabelle, you're crying.
No, Miss Virgie, I ain't cryin', child.
My eyes just kinda slipped.
Well, my daddy will be here soon... and then your eyes won't have to slip.
Yes'm, Miss Virgie.
What are you doing there,
James Henry?
Well, I sleeps in that kitchen... and I wants to hear them Yankees when they's a-comin'... so I dug this hole.
I's gonna cover it over, so when they walks across it... they'll fall in, but they'll make a heap of noise.
And then I'll hear 'em, and I'll start runnin'.
- I hope nobody else falls in it.
- Yes, ma'am.
Look!
Here comes Uncle Billy now!
But he didn't bring Daddy.
- Here comes Daddy!
- Massa Cary's comin'!
- Praise the Lord!
- Daddy! Daddy!
My darling.
Praise the Lord, Missa Cary.
He does come!
The whole Yankee army couldn't stop him.
He's done come.
Thank heaven.
I had to live till you got here and I knew Virgie'd be safe.
Please don't talk like that, dear.
Didn't I tell you that Uncle Billy would find him, Mommy?
Yes, dear.
I bet now that Daddy is here... it won't be long before we have a great big house again.
- Will it, Daddy?
- No, darling.
Oh, Daddy, I wish Mommy didn't have to be sick.
Shh. You've got to be a brave little girl, darling.
Well, can't I be brave and wish Mommy wasn't sick too?
Of course, Virgie.
Mother isn't going to be sick much longer now.
She's going to sleep, darling.
And if there are dreams in that... sleep... oh, my darlings... how I'll dream of you.
Oh, Daddy,
I had a dream last night.
I dreamed Mommy and you were putting me to bed.
And do you remember how you used to tell me fairy tales?
- Come on, honey child.
- First Mother-
What is it, Uncle Billy?
What's the matter, Uncle Billy?
Why does everybody act so funny?
Is something wrong?
No, honey child.
There is something wrong.
Is it about my mommy?
Daddy, what is it?
Did something happen to my mommy?
Something very beautiful, darling.
That's how you must always think of it- that Mama'll never be ill again... or frightened or discouraged.
She'll never suffer anymore.
Just-Just think of it... as beautiful.
- Daddy?
- Yes, honey.
You won't ever leave me, will you?
No, I'll never let you out of my arms again.
- Uncle Billy.
- Yes, Massa Cary?
There hasn't been a Yankee patrol through here since morning.
There's bound to be one soon.
Get Miss Virgie's things ready.
- You mean, you're gonna take
Miss Virgie with you, Massa Cary?
- Yes.
- Through the Yankee line?
- I've got to get her to my sister in Richmond.
- But, Captain, it's dangerous. You can't do it, sir.
- Yankees, Daddy!
All of you go back to your cabins, but don't hurry.
Rosabelle, you go with them and see that they don't talk.
- Uncle Billy, you wait outside and watch.
- Yes, sir.
- Come, honey.
- Don't talk now.
Well, I didn't know-
I didn't know that hole was there.
Honey, do you remember how Mama always taught you never to tell a lie?
- Oh, I never have, Daddy.
- I know, and Mama's proud of you for it.
But if those Yankees should come in here, you've got to tell them a lie.
- You want me to tell a lie?
-Just this once, honey, for Daddy's sake.
And in a case like this, it really isn't a lie.
If they should stop here and they ask you... tell them I was here but I left an hour ago, and you saw me cross the river.
Now be a brave little Confederate, darling.
Do this for me.
- Daddy.
- Hmm?
- Would General Lee want me to tell that lie?
- Yes, dear, this once.
All right, then
I'll tell a whopper.
They's comin', Massa Cary!
Here, help me with this.
Don't be frightened.
Act as though you didn't know they were here.
All right, Massa Cary.
Put that table back up against the wall.
Remember now, act as though nothing had occurred. Dance or play or something.
We will, Daddy.
- What you all doin'?
- You got your mouth organ?
- Yeah.
- Well, get ready to use it.
Sergeant, take your men and search that wood.
Cary's around here, and this time we've got to get him. He's given us the slip long enough.
- Hurry now. Move fast.
- Yes, sir.
All right, men, let's go.
Well, that was quite a concert.
And how is the littlest rebel of them all?
Fine, Yankee.Just fine.
Do you mind if I warm my hands at your fire?
No, sir.
- You two all alone here?
- Yes, sir.
Yes, sir. My daddy was here, but he left an hour ago.
- Is that so?
- Yes, sir. He was here.. . but he left an hour ago, and I saw him cross the river.
Well, now, that's very interesting.
I know another dance.
Oh, yes, sir.
She know a lot of dances.
Now, dance for the gentlemen, honey child.
What was your father doing here?
My mommy was very sick, and she kept asking for Daddy.
So yesterday Uncle Billy brought him... and this morning my mommy went away.
- Is that true?
- Yes, sir.
I'm sorry.
But my daddy says I must always think of it as beautiful.
Your daddy's right. You see,
I have a little girl, too,just about your age... and I'd feel awful sorry if her mommy went away.
- Has your little girl got a pony?
- And a cart.
Does she get enough to eat and everything?
You had the table out in the center of the room, eh?
- No, sir.
- No, sir.
- What are those tracks?
- I made them with my foot.
Is that a trapdoor in the ceiling there?
No, sir. There ain't nothing up there.
Nothing at all, sir.
- You've been lying to me.
- No, sir, I haven't.
- Your father's here now!
- No, sir, he isn't!
- You know he is!
- He was here, but he left an hour ago.
- I saw him cross the river.
- You tell me the truth, or I'll give you the worst-
-Just a minute!
- Drop your pistol.
Now, come down and keep your hands up.
Back over against that door.
Turn around and keep those hands up.
Daddy.
All right, you can drop them now, but no funny business.
Oh, Daddy, I didn't do it right, did I?
Yes, you did, darling.
Daddy's proud of you.
I said just what you told me to.
You were perfect, and I was only fooling about the whipping.
I really wasn't going to.
Run outside, darling.
Daddy'll call you.
Come on, Uncle Billy.
Can you arrange so that my arrest won't frighten her?
- I'll try.
- Thanks.
- Any papers on you?
- No, I'm not scouting this trip, Colonel.
I came home to bury my dead... and take my little girl to
Richmond, where my sister is.
I see.
Well, come on.
Let's get it over with.
I'm afraid I won't be able to- to bid my little girl good-bye.
I understand.
Will you tell her
I've gone back to General Lee?
I'll return soon.
- Yes, it would just about fit.
- What?
- The Yankee uniform.
- What do you mean?
- You know the Cartwright plantation?
- Well.
I left a uniform there to be mended by the slaves.
If you stole that uniform,
I don't know how I could stop you.
- You mean-
- If you were wearing a Union uniform... and had a pass through the lines... you'd stand a mighty good chance of making Richmond.
- Where would I get a pass?
- From me.
I don't think my country expects me to make war on babies.
I don't know what to say.
Of course, you realize what it means if you're caught in my uniform.
Aren't you taking an awful chance yourself, Colonel?
War's full of chances.
I won't forget this.
I hope you get through.
- God bless you.
- There's just one thing I ask.
In passing through our lines, whatever you see or hear, forget.
My word of honor.
Daddy, Daddy!
The soldiers are coming back!
Get out the back way.
Follow the woods to the Cartwrights'.
Daddy, is the Yankee man gonna be nice?
A man couldn't be nicer than he's been.
You see, you've made me think of my little girl.
- I knew all the time you weren't gonna whip me.
- Come on. We've got to hurry.
Good luck.
You're nice enough to be a Confederate.
Good-bye, Uncle Billy.
- Any sign of him?
- Not a thing, Colonel.
Well, you men better come in and warm up.
There's a fire in here.
Yes, sir.
- No trace at all, eh?
- No.
But I'm sure he's still around here.
They buried his wife just an hour ago.
Look! There goes somebody.
- A man and a child?
- Yes. They're headed for the woods.
That's a slave and his pickaninny.
They just left here. They're all right.
- Do you hear anything?
- Horses. Listen.
We've got to go back.
Didn't the man give you a paper to show them, Daddy?
Yes, but the Yanks around here may recognize me.
I don't want to use the pass until we get out of this neighborhood.
This isn't a good neighborhood anyway.
No. Come on.
- Halt!
- Whoa!
- Where are you going, sir?
- I'm taking this child to her father just beyond our lines.
Colonel Morrison sent me.
Here's a pass.
Have you got a little girl, mister?
No, I've got a boy.
- Where'd you come from?
- Cary's plantation. Left there at noon.
- Why aren't you using the main road?
- Full of artillery.
How old is your little boy?
- Five.
- Oh, I'm six.
- My boy's bigger than you.
- He is?
Yes. This looks all right, but I don't know.
We've got special orders to be on the watch for Captain Cary, a rebel scout.
Didn't you hear?
They caught him this morning.
- They did?
- Yeah, Morrison's men, at his own plantation.
- What's your regiment?
- 72nd Vermont.
It's all right then. You'll find them camped just a mile below here. Go ahead.
Thanks.
Oh, Daddy, you told a fib.
Well, this is war, honey.
Why isn't it a sin to tell a fib in war?
I don't know why it isn't a sin to do any of the things we do in war.
What's the 72nd Vermont?
Well, that's a regiment of soldiers
I have no intention of meeting.
Halt!
Colonel Morrison asked me to take this child to Greensburg.
- Here's his pass.
- Colonel Morrison?
- Yes.
- Where was he?
Cary plantation, about 1 8 miles south ofhere.
- When did you leave there?
- Why-
- We left there at 1 2:00.
- Why, you know all the answers too, huh?
Yes, sir. I'm six years old.
Well, I guess you're all right.
Go ahead.
Wait a minute!
I wanna see that kid!
- Whose child is this?
- Friend of Colonel Morrison's.
- Ever see me before?
- No.
Ya didn't, eh?
Don't you remember the shoe polish?
- No!
- Well, I do.
Her old man's the most dangerous scout in the rebel army.
This looks mighty funny to me.
Go get 'em! Hurry up!
Head 'em off!
Take the lower road!
Get under the seat quick, honey.
Halt!
Keep your hands up.
Are you armed?
- No.
- Let's see.
All right, we'll go back.
Follow us.
- Captain?
- Yes.
- I'm afraid I've got to give you some bad news.
- The appeal was denied, huh?
Every finding of the court-martial was upheld.
- That means-
- Yes.
When does the... party take place?
The morning of the 27 th... at dawn.
Well, I still have six days.
Any messages you want sent?
I'll be glad to do anything I can, Captain.
You've been very kind... especially so in getting Uncle Billy here to look after my little girl.
- I appreciate that.
- I wish there was something
I could really do, Captain.
That child has literally captured us all.
- Colonel-
- Yes, I know.
I heard you.
No chance at all, eh?
No.
And is my little party set for the morning of the 27 th too?
I'm sorry, Colonel.
He's innocent, Major.
All he did was try to help a child.
The evidence we couldn't overcome,
Colonel... was the fact that you not only gave him a pass but that he was wearing your uniform.
- I stole that uniform.
- We couldn't make them believe that.
I had hoped we could.
I'll be about, Colonel, if there's anything you want done.
Thank you, Major.
Well, it was a gamble, and we lost.
I have no regrets.
When I think of my own little baby,
I'd do the same thing over again.
Why is a shoe called a shoe?
What?
I says, why is a shoe called a shoe?
What do you mean, why is a shoe called a shoe?
Well, the world is full of names.
They could have picked out any other name.
- Who could?
- Whoever did.
- I don't know who it was.
- Man, what are you talkin' about?
Why is a shoe called a shoe?
Massa Cary says that shows you got brains when you're thinkin' 'bout things.
I spent all day yesterday thinkin', why is a horse called a horse?
Aw, shut your mouth, will you?
What time is it now, Uncle Billy?
I heard the town clock strike 3:00 a while back, Miss Virgie.
Oh, we'll have to hurry.
Daddy always expects me at 3:30.
He says it makes his afternoon seem shorter.
There. That's done.
Shall I brush your clothes now, honey child?
Yes, please.
Do you think they'll keep Daddy locked up in that place long, Uncle Billy?
No, ma'am.
I'm afraid they won't, honey.
You're afraid?
You don't want my daddy-
Oh, no, no, child.
I expects they take him out pretty soon now.
Last night when I said my prayers...
I asked God to let Daddy out of there... and- and I asked him for a new dress too.
Then I thought maybe that was too much to ask... so I told God he didn't have to bother about the dress.
- Was that right, Uncle Billy?
- Yes, that was right, honey.
But if you want that dress...
I'll kinda slip a little hint in my prayers tonight.
Now, Uncle Billy, if you look sad when we get there... like you did yesterday,
I'll never take you again.
No, ma'am, I won't.
We've got to smile, so Daddy will think we're happy.
I will, honey. You'll see.
You ready now?
Yes, all ready.
James Henry, you wait here until we get back.
Yes, sir.
Did you like it, Daddy?
You have charge of Captain Cary's little girl, haven't you?
Yes, sir.
I is one of his slaves, sir.
- I want to speak to you a moment.
- Yes, sir.
That was lovely, darling.
Come on now, and tell me what you've been doing.
Oh, I sewed up a hole in my dress.
Mrs. Robin let me sweep the stoop.
- Why, you're becoming a regular, little housewife.
- Daddy?
- Hmm?
- When are they gonna let you out?
No, no. Come on now.
Tell me what you've been doing.
Well, there's a little girl lives across the street... and she has a pony, and she let me ride on it.
- That's grand.
- And she gave me some candy, and she's a Yank.
And she said she didn't care whether I was a rebel or not... and I said I didn't care whether she was a Yank.
Even if there is a war, she was awfully nice to me.
- Daddy?
- Yes.
When she was so nice, and Colonel Morrison's so nice, and Mrs. Robin... why do the rest of the people have to kill each other?
I don't know, honey.
We grown-ups haven't as much sense as you children.
This isn't money enough, but it's all I can spare.
I'll give you a letter to him.
He may help you. I don't know.
Thank you, sir. Thank you.
You've got four days to try it in.
It's worth taking the chance.
God bless you.
I'll start right now, sir.
- Daddy?
- Yes, dear.
- I don't want to leave.
- Perhaps you'd better.
Tomorrow you can come again.
You're not leaving without saying good-bye to me, are you?
Oh, no.
I was gonna kiss you good-bye.
Then tomorrow when I come,
I'll do all the talking with you.
Oh, you switch around, eh?
Well, Daddy said you tried to help us, so I make you my second daddy.
Nothing so nice ever happened to me.
We gotta hurry, missy.
Good-bye, Yankee.
Good-bye, rebel darling.
Good-bye, Daddy.
- God love you, honey.
- I'll come tomorrow.
- All right, sweetheart.
- Good-bye, Massa Cary.
- Good-bye, Billy.
- Good-bye, Colonel Morrison, sir.
- Bye.
- Good-bye, darling.
- Good-bye.
- Bye.
Uncle Billy, isn't there any way we can get them out of there?
Honey, that soldier man give me some money.
He's gonna write me a letter to give to a judge up in Washington.
He said there's just one way... but I don't know if we got enough money to get there.
Please, sir, how much is the railroad fare for a colored man to Washington?
Six dollars and 20 cents.
And how much for the little girl, sir?
Ah, she's a little too tall for half fare.
Oh, no, I'm not.
I'm standing on my toes.
This is my right size.
All right.
It'll be $9.60 for you, first class.
Thank you, sir.
- Have you got enough?
- No, child.
It's gonna take more money than what we got.
How do people get money?
I know how to get some more money.
Come on, honey child.
Help the cause, white folks.
It's for the cause.
- Which cause?
- The-The right cause.
Thank you. Thank you.
I don't put no money in the Confederate cap.
There you are, boss.
I brung this along just in case.
- Oh, well, that's-
- Thank you.
Here, give me that.
This makes 44, 45, 46, 56.
Bless the Lord. Praise the Lord.
We got enough now, honey, for railroad fare.
Come on, child.
- You may go in now.
- Thank you, sir.
Come on, Uncle Billy.
Come right in.
Miss Virginia Cary and Uncle Billy?
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir, Mr. President.
How do you do, my dear?
Very nicely. Thank you, sir.
And how are you, Uncle Billy?
Let me see.
Judge Van Allen told me about this case.
Yes, sir. He's the gentleman the soldier man sent me to.
Come over here.
Tell me all about it.
There. Now... that's nicer.
My daddy and Colonel Morrison are in prison... and they're going to shoot them.
Your father is a captain in the Confederate Army.
Yes, sir.
Arrested as a spy.
My daddy isn't a spy!
Do you know what a spy is?
I know it's something bad, because they shoot you for it... and my daddy couldn't do anything bad.
I don't see how he could either... with a little one like you.
Thank you kindly, sir.
Tell me about it.
My daddy went away to the war... and then the Yankees came around to our house... and sometimes my daddy came home.
- Was he in uniform?
- Yes, sir.
- What color?
- Gray.
I see.
Thank you, sir.
Then there were so many Yankees around... my daddy couldn't come home anymore.
Then they burnt down our house, and my mommy got sick... and had to go to bed in Uncle Billy's cabin.
No, that's yours.
I had the last piece.
That's right.
We had nothing to get her medicine with,
Mr. President.
The soldiers took most everything we had.
And Mommy kept asking for my daddy.
All the time she'd ask.
No, that's mine.
You had the last piece.
- I beg your pardon.
- You forgot. That's all.
So Uncle Billy went and brought my daddy back home.
The next day, my mommy went away.
There, there. Don't cry.
You're a great big girl.
You mustn't cry.
- I won't.
- What happened next?
Then the Yankees came, and my daddy had to hide in the garret.
Then Colonel Morrison came in.
He talked to me.
He's awfully nice.
He has a little girl, too,just my age.
Then he found Daddy, and Daddy told him... about wanting to take me to my
Aunt Caroline in Richmond... so I could get enough to eat.
That's why the colonel give
Massa Cary the pass, sir- just so he could bring Miss Virgie where she could be taken care of.
I see. Now, on this trip... before your daddy was captured... did he write down anything on paper or anything?
- No, sir.
- Did he ever stop and look at the Yankee soldiers... or count them or look at the cannons?
No, sir. He told me that if we got to Richmond... and anyone asked me what I had seen...
I was in honor bound not to tell them.
- He told you that?
- Yes, sir.
Because Colonel Morrison asked him not to see anything... and my daddy gave his word, and they shook hands.
- John.
- Yes, Mr. President?
- Mr. President?
- Yes, Miss Virgie.
You won't let them shoot my daddy and Colonel Morrison, will you?
- Rush this by special courier to General Grant.
- Yes, Mr. President.
- Is this yours?
- No, it's yours.
I had the last piece.
There, there now.
All your terrible fears are over.
Your father and Colonel Morrison are going free.
There'll be none of that. No trays.
The Star-Telegram has you quoted quite definitely:...
..."Before departing by plane for New York, Mr. Cheyne stated...
...that the new equipment is to be provided by the present bond issue".
The other papers have virtually the same.
What does the confidential bulletin say?
"Tuesday morning. Paris wires...
...the President will probably sign the Bannerman Mining Bill today".
Van Wyck's London cable says:...
..."Conservatives will support the new air program".
Tokyo: "Mr. Gordon's condition excellent. Appendix had not burst.
"Our property loss in our tuna-factory fire will amount to not more than $15,000".
8:45, Mr. Cheyne.
- Our guests still asleep?
- Yes, sir.
Reynolds will drive them out to Connecticut at 11:00, sir.
- Well, let them sleep an hour more.
- Very good, sir.
- Will you be dining at home tonight?
- I don't know.
- You can call me at the office.
- Very good, sir.
Burns, give this to my son. Have him call me at the office on a private wire.
Very well, sir.
Shall I waken them now, Mr. Burns?
No, Mr. Cheyne wants the dear things to sleep an hour longer.
They can never wake up, as far as I'm concerned.
Yes, Master Harvey?
Well, Burns said that...
Oh, here he is now.
Yes?
Your breakfast will be ready in the dining room, Master Harvey.
Yes, but...
But...
Oh, very well.
It wants its breakfast in its rooms.
Prepare the tray.
Why can't I go downstairs and eat my breakfast if I'm hungry?
Is that the way you act in people's houses?
In people's houses, they let you eat when you're hungry.
Well, you're my guest, and you'll do as I say.
Besides, I bet you never had breakfast in bed.
My mother has it, but it's sissy for a fellow to have it, unless he's sick.
Who are you calling a sissy?
I'll take care of it.
Did you say I was a sissy?
I said some people might think eating off of trays was sissy.
Well, let's get something to eat anyway, huh, Harvey?
You heard me order it.
Go ahead, Charles. It'll be in your room.
You want to have some breakfast, don't you?
Yes.
I like to eat the way people eat.
Will mine be in my room?
Sure. Think we only got one servant?
Wait a minute, Pogey.
Why do you want to go around making him mad for?
What if he is?
You just can't remember one single thing.
Getting my father to get his father...
...to make him spend the Easter with us was a plot, wasn't it?
- Yes.
- Come in.
Well, then, what do you want to go around spoiling plots for?
I just wanted to make him feel he owed you something.
- Could you get coffee if you wanted it?
- Sure. I just don't like it.
- Do you want some?
- No, I like cocoa.
Your father instructed me to give you this.
- What for?
- He didn't confide in me.
You're to telephone him, if you get up.
- Is there anything more you wish?
- Yes. You can fill my bath for me.
With pleasure.
We thought you were in bed.
No, and I'm going to eat mine on that desk.
- Are you sorry Easter's over?
- I don't know.
Haven't you been having a lot of fun?
I guess so.
You're the one that's from Providence, aren't you?
Uh-huh.
Why, I'd think a boy from Providence'd be very happy to make a trip to New York.
I'm from way out in Indiana.
All right.
I've got a little brother that I bet'd be happy to have all the luxuries you've had.
He can have my room.
Hello. Hello, Father?
Just a moment.
I'll see if your father's in.
Morning, Son. What?
I'm going back to school now.
Yes, sir. $40.
That's it. I thought you might have to stop for lunch somewhere...
...before you get back to school.
You can treat the boys.
Have a good time, Son.
See you in June. Goodbye.
Goodbye, Father.
He's a wonderful boy.
He was 5 here.
I wish his mother had lived to see him now.
10 years old and yet he's one of the editors of his school paper.
Think of that.
Now, watch.
Sit up, Conrad.
Do you hear me? Sit up!
Sit up! Move.
This isn't the way my Treasure Island looks.
It's the very first way anybody ever saw Treasure Island.
Gee, it's very valuable, huh?
Sure. Would you like to have it?
- It belongs to your father.
- It does not.
My father gave it to me so as I could have it when I grow up.
- You take it as a present, Charles.
- You're going now.
Gee whiz!
I'm glad you like the book, Charles.
Look, Harvey, maybe I oughtn't to take it.
That's all right.
That's just an act of friendship.
Sometime, maybe, you'll want to do an act of friendship for us.
What?
Oh, maybe we might like to join the Buffaloes.
You're the president of the Buffaloes, aren't you?
Yeah, but there's 15 other fellows in the club.
Yeah, but when you get together in Mr. Tyler's room...
...and toast marshmallows and things...
...you talk about who you're going to let in, don't you?
I'm not allowed to tell what we do.
That's all you do.
You sit around Mr. Tyler's fireplace...
...and talk about camping and things like that.
Well, do you want to do an act of friendship?
What if the others don't want you in?
Now look here, Charles...
...you like being the president, don't you?
Certainly I do. It's an office of honor.
And what if you weren't the president anymore?
- You can't do anything about it.
- Oh, yes, I can.
What if you weren't at the school anymore?
I'm going to be at the school.
Harvey could buy the school and shut it up. Couldn't you, Harvey?
No. That isn't what would happen.
Your father sells my father's automobiles in Providence, doesn't he?
Yes.
Well, then, do you think he'd like it if you had a chance...
...to do me an act of friendship and didn't do it?
What if he woke up one day, and my father took away...
...all the automobiles he let him have to sell and said:...
..."You're fired".
You know how many people are out of jobs?
Millions of people.
And they're all hungry and in rags.
They can't send their sons to school.
You're not old enough to work...
...so you'd have to go out with your mother and father and beg.
And that certainly would be awful...
...to have your mother sitting there, all dressed up in rags...
...and eating rotten bread and things like that.
Wouldn't that be terrible?
Your father can't do that.
Now look, Charles,
I don't want him to do it.
I just say I don't want him to have to do it.
I know they won't let you in.
Monsieur Gattard will continue with...
...second and third form French on Thursdays...
...which will replace Dr. Spitzer's science section...
...moved up to Friday afternoon.
That will give Dr. Spitzer more time for golf.
- Thank you.
- That covers everything, gentlemen.
We'll reconvene at tomorrow night's regular faculty meeting.
- Oh, Mr. Tyler.
- Yes, sir?
Harrison's doctor feels he needs another month's rest.
Could you possibly take over first form Latin?
Oh, I think so.
I thought you might like what added salary the extra work would bring.
Well, that's very kind of you,
Dr. Finley.
Did you get straightened away from last winter's difficulties all right?
Yes, and now that you've brought that up...
- I don't know quite how to thank you...
- Oh, don't mention it, Bob.
This ought to make things easier from now on.
- Yes, sir. And thank you very much, sir.
- Glad to do it, Bob.
Hello, Charles. What's the matter?
Can Harvey Cheyne make his father do anything he wants?
I don't think so. Why?
He says if we don't let him and Pogey Williams and Alvin Savage...
...join the Buffaloes...
- I'll have to leave school.
- What?
I don't know what to do with this.
He gave it to me.
It's awful valuable, and he won't take it back.
He gave you this?
He says if he doesn't get in the Buffaloes...
...he'll get his father to take away my father's automobile business.
Well, that's absurd, Charles.
Well, he wanted to be on the school paper...
...and he got his father to give a new printing press, didn't he?
So they had to let him on, didn't they?
- He's always...
- Come in here, Charles. Come in here.
Come on. We've got to set type up now.
- There isn't room for any more.
- What did he write?
- It's about his vacation.
- I want more than this in.
There isn't room for any more.
If you wanted more, you ought to write it sooner.
Give it here.
Hey, give that here!
I want to write some more.
We told Mr. Tyler he could read proof at 5:00.
I don't care. You treat me like I wasn't one of the editors here.
Oh, you used "like" as a conjunction.
- I did not.
- Oh, yes, you did.
That makes 10 cents more you owe to the dunce box.
Yeah, and you still haven't paid up for saying "either, or"...
...instead of "neither, nor" down at the dining hall this noon.
I did not...
Come on.
You're awful slow with that proof.
- It's not ready yet, Mr. Tyler.
- Yes, so I assume.
You have half an hour.
Come here, Harvey.
I want to talk with you.
It's their fault it's late.
They wouldn't let me...
Harvey, I put that first edition of Treasure Island in your room.
Oh, you did? Thanks.
It was a nice gift, but Charles didn't think he ought to take...
...such an expensive present, and I'm inclined to agree with him.
Oh, that's all right.
I want him to have it.
Why, Harvey?
Well, it's...
We don't need it. We've got lots of them.
Harvey, you know that's a silly answer, old man.
- Well, it was an act of friendship.
- You mean a bribe, don't you?
- What's a bribe?
- A bribe's a dishonest gift.
A person who accepts it knows that he must do something dishonest in return.
Be honest, Harvey.
All I wanted was to belong to the Buffaloes.
Look, people give presents after someone's been nice to them, don't they?
So what's dishonest with giving presents before someone's nice to you?
Harvey, why do you think you don't belong to the Buffaloes?
'Cause Charles don't want me in.
It isn't Charles that kept you out.
I kept you out.
What? You said you were a friend of mine.
I am, but sometimes we have to do things for friends...
...that we don't particularly like to do.
Harvey...
...do you remember me saying it hadn't been wise for you to tell the boys...
...that you ought to be a member simply because your father was so important?
Yes.
And I said the way to get in was for you to be important...
...to stand on your own feet...
...not depend on your father for everything you want.
My father gives me everything I want.
Did you talk this over with your father, Harvey?
No. He's got more important things to do.
He's anxious for your happiness, isn't he?
Sure.
- I'm perfectly happy.
- Oh, no, Harvey, you're not...
...because you know you've been dishonest.
- Well, so were you dishonest.
- Now, Harvey.
Well, you took a bribe.
What are you talking about?
Didn't you find some money in your room...
...a couple of days before Christmas vacation...
- ...lying on your table in an envelope?
- What?
Yes. Only it wasn't a bribe.
It was a present...
...because I thought you were a friend of mine.
- Did you put that $50 there?
- Yes.
I was going to tell you it was from me.
I thought maybe you'd make the history exam easier.
You went to the dentist and came back late, and I didn't get a chance to tell you.
- I had no idea it was from you.
- You kept it, though.
It'll be returned, Harvey.
I'm afraid you need a little sterner lesson than I can give you.
What are you going to do?
I'm going to talk it over with Dr. Finley and see what he thinks ought to be done.
You hate me.
- Where's Coventry?
- It isn't a place.
It means he can't talk to anybody, and you can't talk to him.
You just have to pretend he doesn't exist.
And if he tries to talk to you, you have to report it to a master.
What did he do?
I don't know. He's a fresh kid.
That's all.
"Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere
Take thou there from my brand, Excalibur
And fling him far into the middle mere
Watch what thou seest and lightly bring me word
To him replied the bold Sir Bedivere"
- Well, what did Sir Bedivere say?
- That's all I was supposed to commit, sir.
Ten lines.
Does anybody know what Sir Bedivere replied? We'll have to find out tomorrow.
I know what he said, sir.
Persons in Coventry do not speak after a class is dismissed.
Kind of funny about Eddie stopping where he did.
Yes. Yes, it was.
I guess I got a right to look at it, haven't I?
The only reason you got your old paper was 'cause I got it for you.
You make me sick.
Punching somebody isn't speaking to him, is it?
No.
All you got to do is say he tried to break Coventry with you.
Takes some people an awful long time to learn something.
- It'll only cost $10 if you want to go back.
- I'm never going back.
- Why, Son. What's happened?
- I just got here.
I'm all right, I guess.
- What's the matter with your leg?
- Oh, it's all right, I just sprained it a little.
Here, here. Sit down.
- Yes, Mr. Cheyne?
- Ask Dr. Walsh to come in.
Oh, I don't need a doctor, Father.
- What's all this? Tar?
- It's ink from the printing press.
A little of it got on me. I left school.
Dick, I wish you'd see if this boy of mine is all right.
- Well, well, son. Been in a fight?
- I fell down trying to escape.
Take a look at that right leg.
- What do you mean trying to escape?
- It doesn't hurt now.
- Can you walk on it?
- Yes, sir.
It was just a lingament or something.
I think you'll pull through.
- What happened to him?
- I'm trying to find out.
Why do you say you escaped, Harvey?
Because they had me prisoner at the school. Nobody could talk to me.
- I guess they were scared I would talk.
- Who was scared?
That old Tyler and all of them.
- Who's old Tyler?
- He's a master.
He kept me out of the Buffaloes and took a bribe.
- What bribe?
- I gave him $50 at Christmas...
...to make the history exam easier.
And yesterday
I found out he wasn't a friend of mine.
- He fixed it so as I couldn't tell anyone.
- Let me get this straight, Son.
Do you mean to say that a teacher let you give him $50?
- Yes.
- And then locked you up...
...because you threatened to tell about it?
Yes, in the basement.
I had to fight my way out.
- Good heavens, what school is this?
- Green Hill, Connecticut.
- Does Dr. Finley know about this?
- Sure he does.
He's trying to keep it quiet, too.
He's scared because you gave so much to the school.
It's very important that Dr. Finley be at my house this evening.
- I also want to see that teacher, Tyler.
- Yes, sir.
Maybe you oughtn't have anything at all to do with them, Father.
You just let me handle this, Son.
I bet they make up some awful lies about it.
I must point out the extraordinary sums of money that he's had at his disposal.
Very large sums for a small boy.
Well, the boy was confused...
...bewildered, almost terrified when he came into my office.
Your mere assertion that I give him overlarge sums of spending money...
...in no way seems to justify the severe treatment...
...to which he's obviously been subjected.
Mr. Cheyne, Harvey's "severe treatment" came from no member of the faculty.
I've told you of his attempt to bribe
Mr. Tyler. Here's the $50, by the way.
Behind that lies a long list of infractions...
...based on his attitude that he's a special, privileged character.
His attempt to resist the normal, healthy discipline of being put into Coventry...
...brought no further discipline from us.
But it did bring him a solid bash on the nose from one of his fellows.
It was a blow, I am sorry to say, that any one of the other 120 boys...
...in the school would have been glad to deliver.
Oh.
Well, in that case...
- ...have some coffee, Dr. Finley.
- Thanks.
Now, tell me.
This bash on the nose came from a Bison?
- A Buffalo. Wellman is a Buffalo, isn't he?
- Yes, sir.
Perhaps you will accept some coffee, too, Mr. Tyler.
Thank you, sir.
Really, Mr. Cheyne,
Harvey is great material.
He's simply been misdirected, that's all.
Smart. Why he has a mind as fine as any in the school.
Well, he certainly fooled me.
It seems that I have begotten a sort of junior Machiavelli.
Perhaps it's not my place to say this,
Mr. Cheyne...
...but it's simply because you and he have never had any relationship.
To him, you're just a machine pouring out money, a machine he's trying to imitate.
If you take time out from being a tycoon in big business and spend more time...
...getting to know your own son, you'll realize...
I'm sure Mr. Cheyne realizes that very clearly now.
I can see that the school would do with a little more cooperation with me, yes.
But you gentlemen must realize...
...that besides being both father and mother to Harvey...
...I'm tied up in my own work...
...in matters that also relate to his future welfare.
I suppose what you want from me,
Dr. Finley...
...is permission to deal as drastically with Harvey...
...as his future conduct might deserve.
I'm afraid we'll have to leave that in your hands for a while, Mr. Cheyne.
For the rest of the spring term at least,
Harvey will have to be rusticated.
Rusticated?
"Temporarily canned,"
I believe the boys call it.
Well, that is news. And here I'm trying to put you on the carpet.
It seems a bit thick...
...after the printing press and all your other generosities...
...but for that very reason, for the effect on the other boys.
Oh, I understand perfectly, Doctor.
You've no other course.
Well, Bob, if we're going to catch that train, we must be off.
Goodbye, Mr. Cheyne.
I'm sure that when Harvey comes back in the fall...
...he will be a boy that we can all be proud of.
Well, good luck.
My young Mr. Tyler is pretty intense, but he's quite right.
You're rather a nice fellow for a...
What did he call you?
- A tycoon.
- Oh, yes.
Well, you're rather a nice fellow for a tycoon.
So take the boy in with you for the next few months, will you?
You won't mind the extra work. If you give him a chance to live up to you... we're liable to have another splendid citizen on our hands.
- Good night.
- Good night, Doctor. Thank you.
Harvey.
Don't, Mr. Tyler, please don't. Don't.
Two hours ago, you might have gotten away with that very nicely, Harvey.
From now on, it doesn't go.
That's all we'll have to say tonight,
Son.
- Elliot, I am going to be a father again.
- Good heavens, Mr. Cheyne.
No, no, no, Elliot.
No, it's just that it seems that smart little boys...
...from so-called wealthy, well-bred parents...
...don't grow up very successfully by themselves.
- Lf you're speaking of Harvey, sir...
- Yes, I am.
- Did you get passage for next week?
- Yes, the Queen Anne on the 7th.
You wanted to go over the London corporation papers...
- ...before you retire.
- Yeah.
Well, get a larger suite.
Harvey's going with us.
It seems that he's been...
- ...rusticated.
- Oh, I am sorry, sir.
Will you be taking a tutor along with him?
So how the deuce did you know what that meant?
Frankly, I jumped at an obvious conclusion.
Well, you're smarter than I was, Elliot.
No, no tutors.
I've got to get closer to that boy.
I'm darned if I know just where to begin.
Poor kid, maybe it's all my fault.
I don't know.
Oh, well.
I'll make it somehow.
If the radio tells them where every ship is, why do they have to...
- Radiogram, Mr. Cheyne.
- Oh, thanks. What, Harvey?
I said, if the radio tells them where all the ships are...
...why do they have to keep on blowing that old foghorn all the time for?
We're off the Grand Banks now.
A lot of small fishing boats out there.
Too small for a radio.
They don't want to hit any of them.
I bet this boat could go right through one of them.
Why do they have to come so far out from land to fish for?
This is where they get all the codfish and halibut off these banks.
Those boys wouldn't believe you own this boat.
I don't, Harvey. I am just one of the directors of the line.
Well, you're the chairman, so that's the boss, isn't it?
Look, Son, why don't you have some fun with these kids for a while?
I've got a radio to send and then...
...well, later on I'll pick you up, and we'll go up on the Captain's bridge, huh?
Hear that?
My father's taking me up to see the Captain...
...when he gives him some orders, later on.
- Oh, bushwah.
- I'll play you both.
Can't you see we're already playing?
All right, then,
I think I'll get an ice-cream soda.
You can't.
The soda fountain doesn't open till noon.
Oh, no? We'll see about that.
Hey, Purser. Hey, you, come here.
Well, are you the three important customers?
Yes. Have you any money?
- I've got a dime.
- That's not enough.
We'll have three chocolate ice-cream sodas. Make them big ones.
You know we're not supposed to open till noon, don't you?
You've got nothing else to do.
Oh, of course, you'd know all about that.
I know everything about this ship.
I've been all over it.
- Meet with your approval?
- It's all right.
Crew would be glad to know that.
All right, drink them up, boys, and don't take all day, huh?
There's no hurry.
We're going to have another.
- This will be enough for me.
- Me, too.
What's the matter with you?
I could have five or six of these.
- Yes, you could.
- You bet I can. Make another.
But I'll be glad to make them for you, even though I know you can't.
Yeah, I'll show you.
There. You didn't think I could do it, did you?
That's fine, you certainly surprised me.
I think I'll go meet my father now.
That's a boy, and go and eat a great big lunch now.
Look, he's getting sick.
He's gonna be sick.
- Uh-oh. I hadn't counted on that.
- I am not. I feel fine.
I can go and meet my father if I want to, can't I?
Come on, I'll bet you anything.
Which way is it to the deck?
How do I get outdoors?
First to your right.
There he goes, come on.
He came out here.
Hey, Harvey!
You try run Manuel down, huh?
You big killer whale with smoke spout.
You try swallow Manuel like he little smelt, huh?
That's all you ever got to say.
On the Isle of Fishamingo
Lived a chief called Bingo-Bingo
What's this?
That whale she have calf, huh?
Little bull calf, too.
All full of ocean inside.
Here. Here, come on now.
I pull you out of ocean, now you give some of that ocean back. Come on now.
Give back.
Come on, give back.
Fifteen years I've been fisherman.
First time I ever catch a fish like you.
Hey! Aboard the vessel!
Hey.
I bring you new kind of fish.
What'd you get?
I've got new kind of fish.
He got no tail.
He got pants on his dorsal fin.
- I think maybe he about 10 year old.
- Oh, it's a kid, ain't it?
Go on, tend your bell.
- But, Dad...
- You know better than leave your watch...
...especially in the fog.
Go on, tend your bell.
Lend a hand here, Olley!
I pump him out a little bit.
I guess maybe he need more pumping yet,
I think, huh?
Get a buoy-keg.
Roll him.
He must have fell off that liner.
Sure. He no like that big foolish...
He come visit Manuel.
He got more salt water in him, ain't he?
Where...
- Where is this?
- Oh, you's awake?
How's you feeling, boy?
I...
I fell, didn't I?
- Did you pull me out of the water?
- No, Manuel, he fished you aboard.
Who are you?
I's Doc. I's the cook.
How does your throat feel?
- Awful.
- Always do.
Take some of this and you'll feel better.
Oh, that's worse.
- What smells so bad?
- Smells?
Ain't nothing smells bad around here.
Oh, you means the fish.
But they ain't got no smell.
Them's nice, clean salt fish.
70 quintals already done salted down in that forehold.
Is this the bottom of the ship?
Well, where's my father?
Was your pappy overboard with you, too?
- Oh, this is some other boat.
- That's it. We done picked you up.
Oh, where are my shoes?
I've got to see the Captain.
Back here.
Here you is.
You reckon you're pert enough to hop on deck?
You find the Captain and tell him to come down here.
I reckon you're lucky he didn't hear you say that.
- Where are my clothes?
- Here they is and they ain't dry.
- Boy, you...
- Where is the Captain?
Up on deck.
You sure is a tonic to yourself.
How do you do, son?
So you slipped from your mooring.
Going to stay with us awhile.
You look like a spring herring now...
...but you're going to fatten up before the fall.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Where's the Captain?
Aft.
- How do I get to the Captain?
- You got to him.
- Well, how are you feeling, sonny?
- You mean you're the Captain of this boat?
That's the general opinion.
How long would it take you to get to Europe?
Well, I don't know, sonny.
I never tried to sail there.
But I want you to take me there.
I've got to meet my father.
Well, that's a pity, because I'm afraid it can't be done.
All right, then, take me to New York.
I don't think you understand, sonny.
We're working off the Grand Banks.
This schooner is from Gloucester, Massachusetts.
We'll take you there when we're through fishing.
I don't want to go to Gloucester.
You don't? Well, now.
- Is he the Captain?
- We let him think he is.
- Maybe he'd like to be captain, Dad.
- Oh, I don't know, Dan-o.
I know you want to get home, son, but we're out here to catch fish.
We ain't going to leave here till we catch enough to fill the fore and after hold.
Say, look, my father is Frank Burton Cheyne.
Don't you believe me?
I don't doubt you know your own daddy's name.
But we'll pay you if you take me to him.
Don't you want to make some money?
That's what we're hoping to do catching fish.
But he's rich.
He can buy more fish than you ever saw.
Why, he owns the boat I fell off.
- You mean the liner?
- Yes, he practically owns it.
It might have been the fall that done it.
Dories in, sir.
Now you take it easy, son.
- Now you've got to listen to me...
- Dan-o.
Uncle Salters'll take the bell.
You take him down below and let him bend on some of your clothes.
No matter what course we take, son, you can't tack around like that.
Then you go and rest a little more.
- Now, what's your name?
- Harvey Ellsworth Cheyne.
Well, mine's Dan. Come on down below.
So, how'd you fall off that boat in a calm?
There was a storm coming down.
This morning? There wasn't no storm this morning. It was a flat calm.
Well, I ought to know.
There ain't been no more than a little swell all day.
Wait'll we get a rough day out here.
What do you call a rough day?
When she's putting most of her cabin house under water.
Here, put these on.
Wait till you see some of the places we go.
What places?
Stone Fence, St. Pierre's Bank,
Whale Deep, Virgin Rock.
Pop gets a ride along with the fish.
Folks say he thinks like a codfish.
Well, if thinking like a codfish is gonna get me where I want to get...
I don't care how he thinks.
Pop don't make no hasty judgments.
Hey, these are the worst clothes
I ever saw. This stuff itches.
Wait'll you wear them for a little while.
They'll shrink to your tonnage.
- Round to port.
- Come on, get this stuff on. Dories in.
That's got nothing to do with me.
For those 850-pounders
They're more than out-floundered
- Did you bring them in better?
- Lean to port, man.
- Hey, Dave, hoist away.
- Starboard bin, and pull up.
Got plenty of coffee boiling, Doc?
- Yes, sir, Capt. Disko.
- Look at Long Jack.
He's got such few fish they die of loneliness, I think.
You did better, maybe?
Wait till you see what I get.
I get fish with hair on him.
There my new kind of fish!
How you feel, little fish?
Hey, are you gonna cut up all these old fish and stuff before we get going?
I want to get to my father.
Well, it'll be some little time, yet, son.
Easy on that salt, Henry.
- When?
- It's just like you said, Tom.
They're running kind of smallish.
- About three months, son.
- Three months?
When we head into Gloucester with a full load of fish...
...we'll help you find your folks.
- But I want to get going right away.
- Excuse me, son.
Was them sharks ravenous today.
Right stole all my gear.
- Hey, can't you understand me...
- Now, look here, sonny.
I've been close-hauling your problem, and I want to help you...
...but we've got our problems, too.
All of us here share in the fishing...
...and heading back to Gloucester now...
...we'd maybe lose all next winter's daily bread for us and our folks.
You wouldn't want that now, would you?
Are you crazy?
I told you my father had more money...
Hoist away, Jack!
Are you going to listen to me, or don't you understand...
Stand away, boy.
Hey, if you think I'm going to stay on this boat for three months...
Now, look here, son...
I don't blame you none.
Now you won't me either after the bile's out of your system.
And even if your daddy was half what you say...
...it wouldn't be right nor just to gamble two weeks good fishing...
...against a yarn give out by an upset boy.
But I am a fair-minded man...
...and while you're aboard,
I'll pay you wages. $3 a month.
- Now come on, sonny.
You start helping Dan with them cod livers.
Here's a pair of gloves.
We wash them out first, then we put them in there...
...and after we get the bucket full, then we put them in the barrel.
That's how we get cod-liver oil.
- You think I'd do that?
- Here, they won't hurt you, little fish.
Yeah, you heard pop's orders.
You're one of the crew now.
I am not and I'm not going to work on this boat and nobody can make me, either.
Hey, Disko, you hear this?
Come on now, don't be scared, little fish.
You keep away from me.
All of you keep away from me.
None of you can make me do anything.
Hey, Disko. You got mutiny on board.
If you don't want to help, just keep quiet.
When I get off this boat, I'm going to get my father to put you all in jail.
You're all kidnappers.
Well, I guess there ain't nothing else to do.
I'll bet they put you all in jail.
In jail for the rest of your lives, and I'm going to do it, too.
You hit me.
Now you just sit there and think about it, sonny.
Look at Manuel. He's saving fish to sleep on. Catch up, there!
Hey, I do more work as you do with your best girl's six brothers.
Who in the tarnation laid that bucket there? Dag-diggit!
Now, mind what I told you, son.
You're too young to be telling a crew of men...
...what you'll do and what you won't do.
But you might as well start in learning a few things.
You see that gurry?
Well, when you've hove them fish heads overside...
...you can come below and get some supper.
Until you do, you get nothing.
I'm not going to eat, either.
You do as you mind to about that.
Let it rain some more coffee, huh, Doc?
Fog's lifting. It'll be clear in an hour.
How is my little fish? Smiling and happy?
No, he's still sulking.
He's the orneriest kid I ever seen.
Maybe his papa's got so much money he don't want that little boy no more.
- Maybe he throw him overboard.
- He sure spins a yarn for a kid.
- Aye, his papa own that boat.
- Yeah, interesting talker, all right.
Why, he's a good enough liar to write books.
A rope's end, that's what I'd give him.
I'm telling you, it's the fall he took that did it. It plumb distracted him.
My cousin Eben back from Vermont was like that.
He fell off of a barn, and he played with rag dolls for 30 years.
If you want what I think, as soon as this fog lifts we'll take him into Saint John's.
- I mean it.
- And lose two weeks good fishing, huh?
Better than taking a chance on three months bad luck.
Now we have plenty sunshine for Mr. Happy Face.
He's a passenger on a fishing schooner, and you know that's bad luck.
What happened to the Orinoco last year...
...when they took on the passenger at Newfoundland?
On the way home, two men get killed and they don't get hardly a quintal of fish.
- By golly, that true.
- My brother was on the Bedford...
There was a passenger on the Dorothy Clemens...
...when she got rammed by the liner.
Well, that's nothing.
There's lots of vessels lost out of Gloucester...
...never had no passenger on board.
I was a passenger on my father's boat...
...and I never brought him no bad luck.
- Daniel, here...
- Your own son ain't being a passenger.
Skipper, when we trawled this bank last year...
...there was nothing but dories loaded to the gunwales.
This kid comes aboard this morning and look at today's catch.
Now, look here. Wait a minute.
- There ain't no passenger on board.
- Why not?
Well, I made him a member of the crew.
Well, it stands to reason if I'm paying him wages, he ain't no passenger, don't it?
No, sir.
You can't just buy Jonahs off that way.
I hold, he's still a passenger as long as he ain't done no work.
Yeah, and Jack's right.
Well, he'll work as soon as he gets hungry.
What's going to happen between now and the time he does?
Now look here. I decided this.
Manuel's responsible for him being on board. So you got to put him to work.
- Me?
- You got to, Manuel.
Yes, sir.
Manuel, that's only fair and just.
- I stick his face in that gurry.
- You got to do it.
Please do, Manuel. We don't want no Jonahs happenings aboard.
- You gonna do it now?
- I go stand my watch.
- I mean it, Manuel.
- All right.
I think I pay doubles for my mistake, huh?
Me, what likes kids like tub of rat poison. And that kid, two tubs.
He just say one word to me,
I throw him right back to the fish.
Ah, the supper she is great tonight, Olley.
Doc has fish cakes like the stars.
I sure could stow away about a dory-load.
I never taste such fish cake.
And this raisin bread...
Just like cake.
Say, look, you could get me some food, couldn't you?
- But I'm sick and I'm hungry.
- Go away from me.
- Do you want to make some money?
- Go away from me, I break your neck.
Why do you want to be a kidnapper?
Look, do me a favor, huh? Shut your face.
- You're just as bad as the rest of them.
- You crazy. Nobody bad round here.
You just bad luck.
Listen. Listen, you.
You clean up gurry little bit,
I give you a nickel, huh?
See, look,
I'm trying to give you $10,000, maybe.
You get out one of those boats and take me back to New York.
You and me in that dory, huh?
Yes. How far are we from New York?
You want row a Nova Iorque, now, huh?
Well, I know how.
I've been taught in school.
Now, look. You clean up little bit, huh?
Anything. Just so little work.
You want nice boat look nice, huh?
It's a dirty rotten little boat
I wouldn't even spit at.
Say, you... Say, this is finest schooner out from Gloucester.
Jonah, for the last time.
You gonna work or no?
I'm not gonna have anything more to do with you.
That is good here.
Hey, Jonah. Hey, kid.
Where you hiding?
Hey! What you doing?
- I'm going to New York.
- You what?
- I'm going to get away from here.
- Why, you...
- You keep away from me.
- Hey, you.
- Put down that oar.
- I won't.
Put down... Hey, put...
You bad luck, all right! You...
I can do this long as you can.
Oh, you crybaby, too, huh?
I am not.
No? Good. Now look...
- ...you still want row a Nova Iorque?
- Yes.
- You still hungry?
- Yes.
Then come here.
Now. Now you can go below and eat.
That man said I could eat.
- Manuel?
- It's okay, he do some work.
- I did not.
- You clean something off deck, no?
- You made me do something.
- That was work.
That's fine. Sit right here.
- Yes, sir.
- How did you get him to do it?
He do anything for me.
Even break my leg, maybe, too.
Yeah, ho, little fish
Don't cry, don't cry
Yeah, ho, little fish
Don't cry, don't cry
Once Doc baked some biscuit
And throw them away
Next day no more fish
Come around boat to play
Yeah, ho, little fish
Don't cry, don't cry
Yeah, ho, little fish
Don't cry, don't cry
Said cabbage to fish cake
Who lay on one dish
I beautiful cabbage
You only poor fish
Yeah, ho, little fish
Don't cry, don't cry
Yeah, ho, little fish
Don't cry, don't cry
- Who's that?
- Me.
The food was awful.
But it was better than nothing, I guess.
If you hadn't choked me,
I wouldn't have had to kick you.
You kick me? I feel nothing.
All cleared up, hasn't it?
The weather, it's nice now.
- It was till you come up.
- Well, they sent me up.
No. No, I bet they ask you stay.
They said you wanted to show me how to go on watch.
Nice fellows.
- All right. Go ahead, watch.
- How?
Just keep quiet.
Go someplace.
Go look for iceberg or boat or something.
Is that all there is to watching?
That seems like a lot of hooey.
Hooey?
What kind smart talk that "hooey"?
You better tell sailor's angel that smart talk. He like to hear that, I think.
- Who's he?
- I guess you don't know nothing, huh?
Sailor's angel, he fly around up there all time.
You watch here, look out for 25 men below.
He watch up there, he look out for you.
You go sleep, maybe. He tap you on shoulder with his wing and he say:...
..."Hey, Manuel, wake up.
What's the matter? I ashamed for you".
He very nice fellow. Everybody know that.
Oh.
Well, nothing on the port side.
That fine. Anything on starboard?
No. Nothing on the starboard, either.
And nothing in the head.
That port, that starboard.
I bet I know a lot of things you don't know.
I know that's not French you're singing.
That's right. About 10 million people know it's Portuguese.
- I bet you can't speak French.
- Right now I sorry I speak English.
What's this?
That's a boat, that's easy to see.
Yes, maybe your father come back see if you good and drowned, huh?
Yeah, that boat's no bigger than this one.
- What do you keep singing for?
- Because I like to sing.
- I've never heard that song before.
- Me, neither. I just make him up.
You can't write songs.
I don't write them.
I just find them in my mouth.
A song can't be any good like that when you just make it up.
Say, that's best kind songs.
When you feel good inside, like trade wind, she just come out.
O my beautiful lady
People learn songs. Songs aren't just inside of people like that.
Say, sometimes a song so big and sweet inside, I just can't get him out.
And then I look up at stars and maybe cry. It feels so good.
Don't you never feel like this?
- No, I guess you don't.
- Nobody else ever did, either.
Say, my father, when he alive, he made better songs than me.
And what kind of songs did he sing?
Songs about the sun and the sea.
Songs about the clouds.
Big songs about the wind and the storms.
And little songs, too, about the tip of my mother's nose.
Oh, my father, he feel beautiful inside.
- Is that all he did, was sing?
- Is that...
My father was the best fisherman in the whole Madeira Islands...
- ...and that's every place.
- Well, that's not so much.
How you mean, not so much?
Well, I mean, he didn't do much for you.
I mean, he didn't leave you anything.
He didn't leave...
He leave me this hurdy-gurdy that his grandfather leave him.
He teach me how to fish, how to sail a boat.
He gave me arms and hands and feet, feeling good outside...
...and he teach me how to feel good inside.
My father do all this.
He have 17 other kids, beside.
What else a father do, huh?
- Oh, I don't know.
- Say, listen, my...
Capt. Disko!
Capt. Disko!
That Jennie Cushman, she is even now under our stern!
She come make you happy, I think!
The Jennie Cushman?
I might've known it.
Yes, sir.
That's her nosy, long topmast prying into our wake.
Hey, there!
On the Cushman!
Where's that poor excuse for a skipper you got aboard?
And who is it might be wanting him?
You know consarned well who wants him, you bilge-raised haddock!
Well, if it ain't Disko Troop.
And me thinking
I was gonna fish here all alone.
Who passed you the word I was here so you could follow me, Disko?
Now look here, Walt Cushman.
I'm sick near to retching...
...at you using my brains to catch a trip of fish.
Sailing under my wake every time I find a good spot.
Why, Capt. Troop.
Now, is that the way for one gentleman to talk to his colleague in commerce?
You're trailing me
'cause I can find cod...
...where you can't find half a pound of sick squid.
I'll do the fishing, Disko...
...you just get out that checkerboard and try to figure out how really smart you are.
So what, he beat you at checkers last winter, huh?
Yeah, and he cheats at that, too.
He'll beat us into Gloucester this trip, too, I think.
Oh, you think so, do you?
Well, now, listen to me,
I'm gonna tell you something.
I ain't so dumb.
Fussing around like that will make him think the fishing is good here.
Then, in the morning, when the fog banks roll in...
...we'll sneak out and leave him sitting here baiting big and catching small...
...while we're out finding fish.
We'll have a full hold and be tied up in Gloucester...
...by the 1st of August, and he'll still be out here...
...floundering around, trying to catch fish...
...or I'll look more like a halibut than he does.
They sure are mad at each other, aren't they?
No, no, no. They're not mad.
They just make it up.
They do that all time.
About everybody's crazy here.
You make up your songs, they make up they're mad.
You got bunk, you better go below.
- No, I'd rather stay here.
- You go below.
- No, I'm gonna stay here and watch.
- I watch here. You go there, watch.
Go sleep. Do something.
I no understand you.
There's a place in my heart
For the one I love best
And I still keep her picture
Tattooed on my chest
Yeah, ho, little fish
Don't cry, don't cry
Yeah, ho, little fish
Don't cry, don't cry
Well, I stole a march on Walt Cushman all right, I reckon, that time.
Yes, we did that, certain sure.
We did, you darned old farmer.
Go on, hold her to her course, northeast by east.
She heels over so much.
Well, leave her heel. You ain't steering no mowing machine, now.
Heave that lead, Manuel.
He think he got hold stern end of cow, maybe, huh?
Hey, kid. Hey, wake up.
Come on, wake up, little fish.
Hey, wake up, wake up.
Somebody think you dead, they have celebrations.
So that's your tub of rat poison.
You tucked him in his little bunk last night, huh?
What do you mean?
This foolish kid, he bother me.
I don't know. He fall asleep, pulled tarpaulin over him, I guess.
And me, I look all over for this.
You did, huh? I suppose he pulled your coat around him, too.
I look for my coat, too.
- So you stole my coat, too, huh?
- Why, no, I...
Sure, he stole it right off your back.
So big tough fisherman is gonna throw him back to the fishes, huh?
Some day, I think I...
Ten fathom.
Thanks. Thanks for covering me up with your coat and everything.
That's all right.
Would you by any chance be showing any blue pebbles from the bottom?
I never did thank you for saving my life.
I ought to thank you for that, all right.
You feel better this morning, huh?
I guess so.
Well, when you got it figured out, you come and let somebody know, huh?
Blue pebble, she is.
By golly, I think that
Disko know this ocean better...
...as I know inside my shirt.
- Are you fishing now?
- Sure.
I fish for bottom, so she don't fish for us.
Go away with your foolish questions, which don't have no brain.
All right, then, if that's the way you feel about it.
Fifteen fathom and clear away!
By golly, I beat you this time.
He who has a daughter
Oh, what a terrible man
Oh, what a terrible man
Speaking in his native lingo
He said, "Marry Bingo-Bingo"
Oh, what a terrible man
Oh, what a terrible man
He will bring you beans and sorrows
Yes, I know about his morals
Oh, what a terrible man
Oh, what a terrible man
Bingo-Bingo came to woo her
Brought a lot of presents to her
Oh, what a terrible man
Oh, what a terrible man
Dag-gummit, of all the consarned...
What's the matter, farmer?
Think you're sticking hogs?
This dad-bitted boat keeps bouncing around under me, of all...
- What you laughing at?
- Him.
- Well, don't laugh.
- Why? Everybody else did.
It's all right, they got right to laugh.
They know how chop bait.
- You know how?
- Doesn't look like anything.
Go ahead, chop. Tail first.
Try it again, harder.
You fish for sperm whale, maybe.
Don't laugh. Beside, you laugh no good.
Like seagull.
I guess I want to do something.
Yes, but you wanna do just what you want to do.
I tell you what you do.
You go below in galley and help Doc.
You carry slops.
You sweat in galley like Dan did before you talk about being fisherman.
- Go on now, go on.
- All right.
You think Manuel soft with that kid, huh?
You think 'cause I catch him
I let him still be Jonah, huh?
Not on your livings.
Kid, he drive me crazy.
Think I break his neck.
Kid.
- Spit.
- What?
- Spit first.
- Why?
You'll find out.
Oh.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
- You go out fishing?
- Sure, sometimes me and Uncle Salters.
Who goes with Manuel?
Nobody. You don't see him baiting a trawl, do you?
- You mean, he doesn't fish?
- Sure he does. He fishes hand line.
He ain't used a trawl or had a dorymate since his pop died.
Oh.
- Did you start fishing with your father?
- Sure, that's natural, ain't it?
Get your dories ready!
Come on, boys, step lively.
Get your dory to the rail.
Lower your dory to the rail.
Keep well to the westward, Tom.
We'll head straight down the road as soon as we got all the dories spilled.
Come on, get her in the water.
Don't crack that one on me.
Ease a little.
- Thank you, Uncle Salters.
- Manuel, he all set.
Here's a hook.
Isn't it too rough to go out in that little boat?
- What do you mean?
- I mean, to go out alone.
I not go alone. Five minutes,
I have 100 fish keep me company.
I mean, wouldn't it be better if you had someone to row, maybe?
Who I get to row? Doc? Disko?
You very foolish this morning.
Well, I rowed a boat at school.
I could row...
Oh, I see. You row this boat, huh?
What you know about boats when you cannot even chop bait?
I know lots about boats, see?
I know that's the jib, and that's the jumbo...
...and that's the fore rig, and that's the fore topmast...
...and that's the foremast, and that's the triadic stay.
That's the main topmast, and that's the main mast...
...and that's the main rigging, and that's the gurry kit.
That's the Duncan Street, and anything else you want to know?
Where you learn all this?
I read a book on it in Capt. Disko's cabin, and I don't care who knows it.
And you can go row your old boat all by yourself.
I wouldn't go out in it for anything.
By golly, that's smart kid.
About time to break his neck, ain't it?
I got no time break necks.
I got fishing to do.
Lower away.
Hard alee. Stand by the headsail!
Twenty-eight fathom.
She's shoaling fast, Capt. Disko.
We're getting to her.
Twenty-six fathoms, bottom rock.
We're on the bank. Let go your anchor.
Tie up your jib and jumbo!
Stand by your foresails.
Bait them snug, boys, bait them for home and mother.
- This fog is going to lift for you.
- Well, that's something.
Oh, what do you care, Jack?
Pop could find fish in a graveyard.
There's a run of cod on this bank...
...that Walt Cushman won't know nothing about.
Ahoy there, on the mud scow.
Whose anchor chain is that a-rattling like it's full of rust and roaches?
Well, if it ain't Disko Troop.
Did you spring your fore stick trying to follow me, Disko?
I suppose you'll deny
I showed you the road to this spot...
...a year ago this very day, you cross-eyed mackerel.
You want to row over for a game of checkers?
Fishing is mighty sparse here.
We'll never sink under the weight of fish we been catching.
Well, I ain't doing so good myself.
I can lay it to your presence, maybe.
He's lying, the same as me.
He's a plank deeper in the water than he was the last time we seen him.
I think that Walt Cushman, he smart fisherman.
Maybe we better sail after him all time, huh?
Well, boys.
You gotta start in filling fish from now on.
That meddling buoy-tender's near as full up as we are.
We'd be way up around Virgin Rocks by now if it weren't for picking up Jonahs.
He's been working mighty hard, Mr. Jack.
I don't think there's much Jonah left in him. Honest.
Or we might fill faster if our Jonah-catcher...
...would throw away his hand line and bend on a trawl for once.
You don't think I catch as much fish as you, huh, Jack?
I ain't saying that.
Maybe you just bump your head on bunk when you get up this morning, huh?
Or maybe you Portuguese just don't know nothing about trawl-fishing.
I tell you what I do.
I take Jonah kid with me tomorrow.
I fish hand line, I show him same time.
I bet you we bring in more fish as you and Nate toguessers.
"Toguessers". Speak English, will you?
More fish as me and Nate together.
More fish than you and Nate together.
Reckon we take that, Nate?
You mean I'm going to be your dorymate?
I mean nothing of kind.
You just sit in boat and be Jonah.
I do fishing.
- I'm going out with Manuel in the morning.
- That's fine.
Did you say you'd like to bet a little something on that, Manuel?
Oh, you think you scare me on bet, huh?
I tell you what I do with you.
I bet you my brand-new safety razor I buy last Christmas.
98 cents, mail-order house, I...
You put up 50 cents piece.
Brand-new, this year's.
That's a wager.
You sure you didn't bump your head, Manuel?
I no bet on sure thing. I bet on myself.
Just as good.
I guess I didn't mean what I said about going in your boat.
Make no difference what you mean.
You in it now.
I'm awful glad I am, Manuel.
I don't think I'll be a Jonah, honest.
What your name? Harvey?
Well, I gotta call you something.
I'll call you Harvey.
Oh, that's better.
You no laugh like seagull now.
Come on now, I feel tired.
You gotta help row.
Really? Gee!
Put in the pins.
Put the oars in the pins.
We gotta go someplace.
Now, when I say three, you row.
All right. I'm ready.
One, two, three.
That fine school you go to, you row on your back, huh?
I was too anxious, I guess.
Never mind anxious, you leave me be anxious.
Now, come on.
One, two, three. Row!
Row!
We get someplace.
Bottom of the ocean, I think, maybe.
Now we fish.
Well, go on. Bait your hook.
How you think you gonna fish sitting there looking at me?
You bait just like you row boat. Here.
Look, you must put barb all way through.
Like this.
Otherwise that fish he spit that out six, seven times when he feel something.
You know this fish, he don't go to school...
...he don't know French, but he pretty smart, too.
Now drop him down to bottom.
Then pull up about six inches, maybe...
...so he look fish straight in eye and say,
"Look here. I got corn beef and cabbage".
Hey, I've got one.
You got new idea, maybe, too, huh?
What you think, we just feed fish free here for nothing?
I guess I was too anxious again.
I told you, stay away from that anxious business.
Let the fish be anxious. Here, look.
One, two...
...now it's in his mouth.
Now up he comes.
Gosh. Can I take him off the hook?
We got no time for that.
We don't know this fish personal.
- Hey, I've got one now.
- All right, pull him up.
Don't let him stay down there and tell all other fish what going on.
Pull him up! Hey, wait a minute. Hey...
...you gonna bring fish up see you, you going down to see him?
- Pull him up!
- I will.
Oh, the boat tipped and I...
Oh, he got off.
How you expect catch fish, falling on your backside all time?
Bait your hook.
Don't look like they was jumping in your dory.
I wait till I get soft place for them to land in first.
I'll catch the next one.
You'll beat Long Jack and Nate.
Don't you worry.
He won't get your razor.
You think so, huh?
Nothing going on here now.
That fish, he have meeting down below.
He tell all other fish there's something not so funny going on.
Has your father been dead a long time?
Six year, next month.
Seem a long, long time.
How did he die?
He drown off Cape Sable in storm.
Wave come at night and wash him overboard.
- Didn't they find him?
- No.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- What you sorry about?
Well, I mean your father.
They didn't find him.
What they need find him for?
He all right.
Well, but, drowning out in the ocean, all alone at night...
Well, what's trouble about that?
That fine way.
The Savior, he take my father up to fisherman's heaven...
...up with all his old friends.
Quick he take him up. Quick.
Just like I pull up this 35-pound fish.
The Savior, He see my father all tired and wet down there in the water.
So he light the harbor buoy and he say:...
..."Come on up, old Manuel...
I so happy you come up here to help us fish".
And my father, he say, "Thank you.
I very happy to come up, too.
And maybe I show you something about fishing up here, huh?"
And then they all laugh.
And the Savior,
He put his arm around my father...
...and He give him brand-new dory to fish in.
You think they really fish in heaven?
Why, sure they fish in heaven.
What else they do?
The Apostles, they all fishermen,
I think.
You remember that Simon, called Peter?
Remember that time when...
...he don't catch no fish in the sea of Galilee?
And the Savior, He stand on the shore and He say:...
..."Simon, you throw your net on the right side".
And Simon, he throw his net on the right side...
...and he catch so many fish, his net, it almost break in two.
I think the Savior,
He the best fisherman.
But my father, he come next.
And not fishing like this. Oh, no, no.
Fish bite all time.
When no more fish, the Savior, He make more fish.
He make more fish. He make more bread.
He make more wine.
And at night He stand watch all by Himself.
He say:...
..."Good night, fishermen.
You tired now.
Go to your bunks.
And no snorings, please.
Good night, Manuel's father".
Oh, that very nice place.
Oh.
Sometimes I think I go there right now.
Then I say, "Now, whoa, Manuel.
You gotta be better fisherman first.
That Savior, He only give dories to first-class fishermen, like your father".
So I keep on fishing. I no hurry.
I know my father keep place for me in his dory.
Hey, sleepy-face, look.
- You log on a bump.
- Oh, say. I didn't...
Easy now, easy. He's a big one.
And stay off your backside, you hear me?
Come on, pull him up.
I'm trying to...
You want Manuel help, huh?
I think you get blisters.
Blisters good for fishermen. Come on.
Pull him up, pull him up.
- Hey, what's this?
- Yeah.
- Pull him up. Pull him up.
- What is he?
He's a halibut.
Big, like mainsail, huh?
The boat tipped again.
Gosh, I told you I'd get one, didn't I?
By golly. My little fish catch fish bigger than he is.
I feel my whiskers disappear now.
I told you we'd beat Long Jack and Nate, didn't I?
Sure, we beat everybody.
Manuel and his little fish, they beat everybody.
We make fisherman out of you, huh, little fish?
What chicken-livered squid done this?
Easy, Jack, them hooks!
Hey, Long Jack. What's the matter?
We were putting out our second tub, and Jack was snagged overside.
He might as well have fastened to an octopus.
- Get him a knife.
- Cut him off.
Nate, I think you need new dorymate, maybe.
One what's good fisherman.
Maybe next time you get one what ain't old lady...
...what gets all mixed up with knitting needles, huh?
- That Long Jack, he is mad.
- I knew he would be.
That will stop him fishing for a while,
I guess.
What you mean you knew?
When I heard you betting last night with Long Jack...
...I sneaked up on deck and tangled up his trawl.
What you do?
Sure. I put some knots in it and took a lot of bait off the hooks.
What are you going to do?
You still alive and strong, huh?
That good.
You go back. You tell other fish:...
..."Manuel ain't got no fisherman in his boat.
He got no dorymate.
He just got cheat".
And I no catch big, strong, honest fish like you that way.
Tell them good and loud.
Oh, but, Manuel, I just wanted us...
I just wanted you to win. That's all.
Well, what have we got here?
What's the matter? I don't remember hoisting no signal to come aboard.
We lose something.
Something we never have, I think.
This kid, he no like our way fishing.
He want come back.
Manuel, won't you listen?
You give him hand, maybe.
He got no way cheat himself overside.
Come on, son. Kid, come here.
Don't like fishing, son?
What happens... What do you do when people don't speak to you around here?
Now, you have to settle that yourself, son.
I'm skipper to a crew, but I ain't dry-nursing them.
I don't take no part in squabbles.
They settle that between themselves, just like everything else.
Whatever's foul between you and Manuel...
...you will have to free and clear yourself.
Hey, Doc.
Yes, sir, that sure do beat all.
- What was he saying about me?
- He don't say nothing about you.
Just got a new funny story, that's all.
You should have come aboard this morning, Jack.
These things are worked in pretty deep now.
And lose a day's fishing? No, sir.
That's what somebody expected me to do.
No yellow-livered job is going to keep me from doing my share...
...or winning a bet, either.
I can pull this one through, Jack...
...but I'm afraid
I'm going to have to cut the others.
Fine.
Here's the bet, Jack. I pay prompt, huh?
I'll take it
'cause I won it fair and square.
That's a sight more than you tried to be.
You crazy, Jack.
You don't think I fouled your trawl?
That trawl fouled itself, maybe?
I been handling trawl for 20 years,
Portegoosie...
...and I never seen line snarl itself that way, except by human hands.
Well, maybe you too anxious to win bet, Jack, huh?
Maybe you no keep your mind on things.
Listen, Portegoosie.
Either you or that kid done it.
It stands to reason.
If I found he put his Jonah flippers into my trawl...
...I'll wind him twice around the capstan and break him off short.
I think you put hooks in yourself so you got chance to drink more rum, huh?
You call me a cheat?
Jack, you talk too loud, you drink too much rum, huh?
I'll discover right now who done it.
Or, by thunder, I'll cut hooks out of you where there ain't none.
Jack, you hurt your arm.
Don't, Long Jack, don't.
It wasn't Manuel. I did it. I did it last night while you were having supper.
But I didn't mean you should get the hooks in your arm this way.
Honest, I didn't.
I just thought we'd have a little fun and win...
- Why, you sneaking little...
- Jack, what you do?
You keep out of this, Portegoosie.
Oh, Long Jack, what do you worry about?
He admit the whole thing like regular grown fella.
He say he sorry.
Everything all right now.
Nothing's all right till I beat his ears off. Get out of my...
- You touch that kid, I tear you apart, see?
- Yeah?
Me, Manuel talking.
I tear you apart, see?
So don't get me mad, Long Jack.
I get all crazy and sick inside.
All right, start cutting, Disko.
Maybe he cut picture of your girl out there. Huh, Jack?
I am telling you, Manuel, keep that kid away from me.
He's a...
He's a Jonah, and you'll find this is only the beginning.
What's the matter, little fish, you sleepy?
- I'm so ashamed, Manuel.
- Sure.
We all got be ashamed once.
So we don't do things again what we got be ashamed of, see?
Yes, but you not speaking to me...
...and those hooks in Jack's arm...
Jack, he very tough man.
All fishermen have hooks in them.
Oh, sure. Two, three, four hooks.
My father, he have hook in his arm right here.
And three year later, he think he have pimple on back of his neck.
You know what was it?
Hook coming out.
And my father, he say, "So that's what's been in Denmark all this time, huh?"
That fine.
There's a school of fish
Way down deep in the sea
Where the little fish
Studied geography
My father, he teach me this song.
And I put your kind of words to it.
There they write on a slate
And they read from a book
Learn to run with the bait
Then just leave them the hook
I got to sing every time I get mad.
It drive those flying fish out of my stomach, do you know?
Yeah, ho, little fish
Don't cry, don't cry
You'll be a baleia
By-and-by
Baleia, that mean big fish...
...like whale, you know?
With fins and a tail
To help you sail
And maybe some wings
To help you fly
Yeah, ho, little fish
Don't cry, don't cry
Yeah, ho, little fish
Don't cry, don't cry
Here's Disko. Cod must be coming.
Hello, friend!
- Hiya, James!
- Come on over.
There the Blue Gill.
She's from Gloucester, same as us.
And there's the Elizabeth K. Brown.
She sail good when the skipper he is sober.
There the Flying Swan.
She drag her anchor all time.
Everybody comes here and fishes last...
...because it's the biggest and best bank, huh?
Sure. Only some come too soon, some come too late.
Disko, he come right with codfish, see?
- Say...
- Look, look, look!
There Virgin Rock I tell you about.
Now watch, watch, she gonna roar.
Say, that's the bottom of the ocean.
Sure. She get lonesome sometimes.
She come up for a little look around.
Yes, sirs, by thunder, there she is.
I think that Jennie Cushman she filled with fish already.
She beat us home, huh, Disko?
He got here too early.
The real run ain't started yet.
By this time tomorrow, we'll be fishing
72-hour stretches, hand line.
The cod will be covering this bank like herring.
Walt Cushman beats me into Gloucester,
I'll hang myself with an eel.
Hey, at the wheel, there. Downwind!
All right, up, up, up. Hurry.
Pick it up. That thing's squirming.
Bring him in, Danny boy, bring him in.
In case some of them ain't expecting this.
We're full up and ready for home.
Hey, little fish, that's for us. Disko say we all full up and we go home. Come on.
Hey, pitch up that last fish, Manuel.
Then you and Harvey's going to take me a-visiting.
- Hey, Daniel?
- Yes, sir.
As soon enough hands come aboard, tell them to turn to...
- ...and heave up that anchor short.
- Yes, sir.
Hey, aboard the vessel.
Would anyone on the Flying Swan be wanting to send any mail to Gloucester?
We got sickness aboard.
We're heading for home.
Go on, Disko Troop.
You and your sickness.
You're just crowing, that's all.
No, we all catch too many fish, too soon.
We all sick about it.
Well, some of the lads expected you, Disko.
You could mail those, if you will.
It's a pleasure to be postman to you, Benjamin.
Why don't you sign up with me next season...
...and get home before the snow flies?
I know what you're going to say, Disko.
I don't want none of your sarcasm.
We heard your bell and saw your flag.
I hope you founder with all hands.
It's nice to have your good wishes, John.
Hey, Disko.
If our new baby is born before I get back...
...talk Molly out of naming him
Hubert will you?
- She wants to call him Hubert.
- Another baby, Martin?
Well, you ought to stay at sea all the time.
That's what he do if he stay on this boat.
Hey, there! Aboard the Bluegill.
Any mail for Gloucester?
Kind of late starting the crew, ain't you, Disko?
Well, I just thought
I'd like to carry your mail, Peter.
We just come back from rowing our mail over to the Jennie Cushman.
- That's a poor attempt at a joke, Peter.
- Yeah?
Does that look like a joke?
Why the sneaking sand shark.
Never ring a bell nor nothing.
Never give us no sign he was going to swing off today.
Get back to the vessel.
Give me them oars.
- But I can...
- Well, go on then. Put your back into it.
Hey, aboard the vessel.
- Get that anchor in!
- Hey, what's eating Disko?
- Is he liquored?
- Aye on that. It's the Cushman.
Pull up your foresail.
Hey, Disko.
Here comes the Cushman.
You don't think I took it for a waterspout, do you?
Hey, get that anchor in.
A-heave, a-ho. A-heave, a-ho.
A-heave, a-ho. A-heave, a-ho.
Goodbye, Disko. What's the matter?
Have you run aground?
You haven't any mail for Gloucester, have you, sir?
If you'd save your wind to fill your sails...
...you might keep us from passing you.
- We're going to race the Jennie Cushman?
- Sure.
Come on.
This fine kind racing business.
You got that backside anxious business, huh?
You gonna row or swim to Gloucester, maybe.
This fine time diving and swimming.
Put your back into that windlass.
You don't think that anchor's going to float up out of the water, do you?
Sway up on them halyards...
...and you needn't be afeared of parting them.
Wipe down them dories.
We're going to bury her nose this trip.
I can't work with this in me.
Pull it through, will you?
- Start hollering. Nobody hear you.
- I haven't the time.
Now stick that in your face and suck blood out.
Anchor all clear.
Get it aboard and cathead it.
On your main halyards now.
Sway up that mainsail!
Come on, sway her up.
Two blocks is where I want to see her.
Come on!
She's got a good lead on us, Capt. Disko.
Yeah. Got his topsails set already.
Running like a scared sardine.
I'll climb over his stern rail or sail the bottom out of us.
She's stepping now.
Just look at this lady go.
It's awful heavy going, Disko.
If a big one ever hits her when she's heeled over like this...
Don't you worry about this little lady.
She can take care of herself.
I told you so. Now what'll I do?
Ease her off a bit. Give her a hand.
She'll right herself.
Disko must have picked up an engine someplace.
Yeah. Well, wait till tonight.
I'm shortcutting across Franklin Shoals.
He won't dare follow me with his draft.
- Six fathom.
- Six fathom. Yes, sir...
...he's taking a shortcut across this bank, and thinking I'm going to get scared...
...and swing her off.
Well, I'll cut shorter.
Five fathom.
They're feeling for the bottom, all right.
- Five fathom.
- He can do it with that hull of his, Disko.
But we draw more water than the Cushman, don't we?
I know what water we draw.
You keep her to it.
Three-and-a-half fathom.
Hey, Disko, you ain't been looking down the neck of a jug again, have you?
Now listen here, farmer,
I can draw 16 feet of water...
...and not find bottom, can't I?
I ain't ripping out no keels, but I'm going to beat Walt Cushman...
...into Gloucester and that's all there is to it. So don't you swing her off.
Why, I know this bottom as well as my wife knows her own kitchen.
- You keep her to it now.
- I'm with you, Capt. Troop.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I'll bet old Walt's hot under his hatches.
- Shake your bustle, little woman.
- Yes, sir.
Manuel, we're gonna pass them soon.
Oh, sure. That Disko, he pass anything.
He half porpoise, I think, huh?
What are you doing?
I figure up how much
I get my share fish in there.
If market price good, say four-and-a-half, five cents pound, Manuel, he get...
By golly, I gonna have lots of money.
And with my $3 a month,
I'll have $9, won't I?
Sure. We very rich men, now, huh?
We have fun spending it when we go ashore, you and me, huh?
- What will you do ashore?
- Well, first I gotta go church store.
You know, where you buy a crucifix and Madonna and things.
And I buy a little two-place gold candlestick I see there...
...that I take to church, and I light candles for my father's birthday.
3rd this month, August.
Oh, that's very nice, Manuel.
Not so nice as my father should have, maybe.
It's nice in small way.
I think maybe
I light candle for myself, too.
- I have few bad thoughts this trip.
- You never had any bad thoughts.
- Oh, sure.
- What were they?
- I forget them now but I have them I think.
- Then what will you do?
Oh, then I get dressed up.
Oh, I go to get nifty suit.
You know, purple-colored.
Oh, very nifty suit.
With cloth-topped shoes to match, you know? And big pearl buttons.
And then I get new tie with big yellow flowers.
Then I walk up and down Duncan Street, and I say, "Hey, girls, girls...
- ...hey, look, look. Manuel is in town".
- Girls?
Oh, sure. Beautiful girls. I got maybe five, six girls in Gloucester.
I tell each one I like her best.
You gotta tell big lies to girls...
- ...to make them happy.
- You don't go with the girls?
Oh, sure I go with girls.
Every man go with...
I guess maybe you're right.
- I don't go with girls.
- I kind of thought you were kidding.
Oh, sure, sure.
That girl business is all kidding. Sure.
I think maybe I gotta do some more kidding from now on, huh?
Here we talk all time about what I do.
What you do?
You talk to your father on telephone, huh?
You tell him you live and happy, huh?
My father?
You forgot about your father what own that big boat you fall off...
...and he think maybe you swallowed up by shark or something.
Oh, well, I don't know.
You don't know how happy he be, huh?
- Oh, I guess he'll be glad, all right.
- He leave his skin, I think.
He hug you to pieces and take those pieces back home with him, huh?
But I don't want to go back home, Manuel.
You don't want go home?
Well, I mean...
What do you mean, little fish?
I want to stay here with you in Gloucester and go out fishing again this way.
You want be fisherman?
I want to be a better fisherman than Tom Platt or Dan.
I want to be as good as you are.
As good as me, huh?
Oh, that very nice, little fish.
But how about your father? He come, too?
Oh, well, I could see him between trips, if he wants to see me.
What you mean, if he want to see you, little fish?
Oh, well, he's got his business and everything. He'd be all right.
I want to be with you, Manuel.
Please.
My little fish.
If you all want to see a boat what's going to be passed, come and see one.
Hold her to it, Manuel.
We'll lay her right alongside them.
It will be the best boat from here in.
I'll take a reach for his beard as we pass by.
Them topsails will carry away if we keep this up.
I'll take the lower spars out of her before I'll let Walt Cushman...
...work the windward of me.
She's driving now.
Yes, sir! Walk along, little girlie.
They're coming now, Walt!
I guess they got us.
No, he ain't! There's more than one way to open a clam.
Stand by to come about!
What's this? Disko, he coming about.
For more funny business, I think.
Why, the calm-weather coward!
Can't take an honest licking.
Try and bluff me, will he?
Stand by the main sheet!
Steady, Manuel.
Now watch him jump and holler when he has to give way.
I'm gonna cut plumb across his bow!
- Give away to her, Disko.
- Well, I ain't giving way, neither.
- You've got to budge.
- I'll budge like a barnacle.
She'll cut us down, sure.
- Steady as you go!
- Hold her to it, Manuel! Don't lose an inch.
Land sakes, Disko, here she comes!
Hard to starboard!
I had the right of way, you old beach goat!
- You must have mislaid it somewhere!
- Still riding anchor, ain't you?
Well, we ain't to Gloucester yet. I'll do more than keep you in sight, Disko!
Capt. Cushman is a sailor
But he should have been a tailor
Oh, what a terrible man
Oh, what a terrible man
Cushman might have been a grocer
But a first-class seaman, no, sir
Oh, what a terrible man
Oh, what a terrible man
Poor old Walt broke his jib, and he's checking his topsails.
You'll best do the same, Disko.
That main top'll go if you don't.
Well, since you're such a nervous galoot, and we got old Walt licked to a frazzle...
I'll mind what you say.
Go aloft with Jack, Manuel.
Stand by to try the topsails.
I go up to get a little air,
I think, maybe?
Want to luff her first?
I'll luff her when you reach the masthead.
Somebody open window and let in nice breeze, eh, Jack?
I'll bet Manuel is the best fisherman in the whole fishing fleet, isn't he?
Stand by to clue up the fore topsails!
- Step lively up there now!
- Slack away below!
Hey! Look out for yourselves!
- Watch it!
- Manuel!
Jump down!
Manuel!
Luff her, Nate!
In heaven's name, Nate, luff her.
I can't, she's jibing!
Hold fast, Manuel!
Manuel! Manuel!
Get a dory overside!
Are you all right, Manuel?
Can you work free?
Doc!
Capt. Disko!
We'll get you out of this in a minute, Portegoosie!
He says he's good as dead. Gone.
He knows it.
Why, Doc? Why?
He's stove in.
All the bottom half of him's gone.
But he don't want the kid to know.
You're all right, aren't you, Manuel?
You aren't hurt, are you?
I all right, little fish.
What's holding up that dory?
Disko, don't put dory overside!
You hear what Doc...
But we've got to free you, Manuel.
No. I say don't put dory overside!
What's he mean?
What's the matter, Manuel? Manuel!
Hey, Harvey! Harvey, mind the boy!
No, not out here. Go back.
You're all right, aren't you?
You aren't hurt, are you, Manuel?
I all right.
Get that dory in the water.
I can't do nothing, Disko.
He's fouled in the backstay.
Manuel!
The drift's tightening, Disko.
You'll have to cut him loose, or it'll take him in half.
No.
We ain't cutting loose unless it's going to help you free Manuel.
You cut him away, Disko, you hear me?
Get me an ax!
No, Capt. Disko. No!
You cut that line, it'll carry him under.
We can't just keep him out there till the line saws him in half.
Get me an ax.
I sorry about race, Disko.
You beat him next year, huh?
Manuel!
Now listen, little fish...
I go now and fish with my father.
You remember I tell you he keep seat for me in his dory.
What are you talking about?
You're not going. We'll save you.
We have good times together, eh, little fish?
We laugh, we sing, so you smile now.
Come on, smile.
Long Jack can fix it.
You'll be all right. See, Manuel?
Good.
Manuel, he be watching you. You'll be best fisherman ever, little fish.
No, no, Manuel. No.
Manuel!
Well, goodbye again, Harvey.
So long, sailor.
Going down to get your pay, Harv?
I guess so.
You're leaving too, huh, Long Jack?
Yep.
You'll begin to grow whiskers right soon, and I thought maybe this might be...
...a good thing for you to start in with.
Thanks. Thanks, Long Jack.
You've just got fuzz now, but if you start scraping them off they'll toughen up...
...and get like... Get like...
Fair weather, Harv.
Goodbye, Long Jack.
I got everything, I guess.
Yeah. Say, Dan, these clothes...
I guess I kind of wore them out some.
Oh, that's all right.
Well, Dan, I'd like to keep them...
...but I can't pay you out of my pay yet because...
...well, there's something I sort of wanted to do. So I was just thinking...
There ain't no hurry. Your pop can settle it with my mom when he gets here.
Say, is he really flying out here all that way? All in one day?
I guess so.
You sure got the laugh on all of us...
...him having all that money you said he had and everything.
Say, Dan, when somebody...
...I mean, when something happens to somebody...
...what do they do with the rest of their things?
Their family get them, I suppose, or whatever kin they have.
Well, did he have any kin?
No, not that anybody knowed of.
Well...
If someone liked someone a great deal...
...and he didn't have any kin, that would sort of make him a kin almost, wouldn't it?
And, well, if they had something like this, for instance, that wasn't worth a lot...
I don't know, Harvey.
You better ask Pop about that.
He'd know more about that.
Oh.
Well, boy, come to get your pay?
Why...
There you are, our deal when you signed on.
Fisherman's Home?
Yeah, that's where the poor and old and crippled of us...
...set on a sunny porch and try to out-lie each other.
Manuel would want it that way.
You wouldn't have a better idea, you think?
Well, he wanted to get a candlestick for his father with two places.
How much would that cost?
Oh, $2 or $3, I reckon. Here.
Oh, then that's all right.
I have enough.
What'll you do with the rest of Manuel's things, Capt. Disko?
Oh, we'll send them up along to the Home,
I guess.
Does this have to go?
Why, no, Harvey.
I thought maybe you'd like to keep that.
Your daddy will be here directly.
You're kind of stretching to see him.
Ain't you?
Yes, sir.
When are you going out fishing again?
Oh, in about six weeks, when we're shipshape aloft.
Well, will Dan go, too?
No, that's the winter season.
Dan'll stay here ashore, school.
Then you'll need someone to take his place, won't you?
Yes, sir, I need a good hand to take Dan's place.
Well, I was thinking...
Maybe I'm not quite good enough yet...
...but Manuel said I was getting...
Manuel said...
Well, son?
Well, Manuel taught me so much,
I know I could.
And if you'll take me along, I'll...
Well, now, there's nobody
I'd rather sign than you, Harvey.
But ain't you kind of forgetting...
...all the lost time you and your daddy have to catch up with each other?
You'll want to berth alongside him for some time to come, won't you?
- Yes, sir, but...
- Harvey!
...he has lots to do.
And I like being a fisherman.
I've been thinking about it.
I want to be as good a one as...
I mean, I want to stay here with you on the We're Here.
Harvey! Hi, Harvey! Where are you?
It's Father.
There's your daddy now, ain't it?
Yes, sir.
So if you'll tell me now...
- ...whether I can...
- Harvey!
Hello, Father.
Harvey, Son.
Well, well. My boy again.
So you see, Harvey, by leaving early tomorrow morning...
...we can get the sleeper plane out of Boston.
- Yes, sir.
- You'll like the sleeper plane.
It's great. Big berths and everything, just like a Pullman.
- I know. But, look, Father.
- What?
I was thinking that if...
Maybe I could go somewhere on a boat.
All right. I was going to put the yacht up for the winter...
...but we might take her out and go to Bermuda.
I didn't mean the yacht, I meant the...
Oh, well, I don't know.
Well, you see, the plane would get us to the ranch...
...in time for the rodeo after the roundup.
You'd like that, wouldn't you, Son?
But there's no fishing out there, is there?
The best trout fishing in the world.
And if I do say it myself, I can teach you to cast a fly wherever you want to put one.
Yeah, I read about that kind of fishing once in a magazine.
Manuel said that any fish that ate a bug was some kind of a frog.
Who's Manuel? He sounds like a pretty funny sort of person.
He's the man that picked Harvey out of the water.
Well, I certainly want to meet that man,
Capt. Troop.
- Where is he?
- He's dead, Mr. Cheyne.
Where are you going, Son?
Just out. I'll be back in a little while.
- Don't you want me to go with you?
- No.
I mean, I'll be back in a little while.
Really, I will.
Well, I guess that's all the vittles.
Will you come in the parlor and chat a while?
Yes.
Where was he going, Capt. Troop?
Oh, I reckon he has a couple of errands to do.
Will you have a pipe?
I got some pretty fairish tobacco here.
- No, thanks.
- Have a chair.
That was fine pie, Mother.
Thank you, Discobolus.
I'll leave the dishes awhile.
Dad, is this boom set in here just right?
Well, let's see now.
Capt. Troop, tell me, that hurdy-gurdy...
...and the razor, were they Manuel's?
Yes, they was, Mr. Cheyne.
He must have been a pretty fine man.
Harvey's a fine boy now, the kind of boy I'd always hoped he'd be.
Yes. They was real dorymates,
Mr. Cheyne.
Yes, I had that chance once.
I'm afraid I threw it away.
Now that I got the chance again, I...
Well, I guess I'm just getting what I deserve.
Well, as long as you set your course a little too late...
...maybe Manuel sailed it for you.
But that don't say you can't sail it after him.
You're still the boy's dad, man.
A boy is never too old not to need a dad.
You just hold a hawser out to him.
Someday he's going to lay onto it and pull you right into his heart.
And when you do get in there, you'll find
Manuel mighty satisfactory company.
Yes, sir.
Sure you won't change your mind, have a pipe, Mr. Cheyne?
No thanks, Capt. Troop. I...
I think I'll take a little walk, if you'll excuse me.
Yeah, why don't you do that?
Stroll up by the church, maybe?
Yes, it's mighty pretty there this time of evening.
That one is from Manuel to his father.
Yes, my son.
And that one is from me to Manuel.
Do you think they're good enough?
I only had $9.
Oh, I know they are.
- What do I do now?
- Would you like to kneel here and pray?
- Can I say anything?
- Anything.
Do you have to stay here?
No, my son.
Look...
...I guess you have an awful lot of things to do...
...taking care of everybody.
Look, if it is that way, the way Manuel said...
...could you fix it so someday...
...there'll be an extra seat in Manuel's father's dory...
...with him and Manuel?
Because I just got to be with Manuel.
I got to.
I guess that's all I wanted to ask.
So, please.
Harvey.
Harvey, Son.
I just wanted to get out in the air for a little while.
Go ahead, Son, let it go.
I know about it.
- I know about Manuel.
- Please, please go away.
Harvey, we haven't talked much before, have we?
But we can start now.
We can talk this over.
We can talk over everything from now on, can't we, Son?
You better go up to the house.
I'll be back in a little while.
- Really, I will.
- No, let me stay here with you.
Maybe I can help.
Come here to your dad, Son.
I don't mind your crying.
Please don't get in this boat.
This is Manuel's dory. Manuel's and mine.
I know it hurts, Son, but you won't always feel like this.
Just think, tomorrow you'll be on that big sleeper plane.
Before you know it, you'll be flying right over the tops of the Rocky Mountains.
I don't want to go anywhere but here.
I want to stay here...
...and go fishing, the way Manuel did.
- I want to be where Manuel is.
- Harvey.
Son, won't you listen?
- I'm lonely, too.
- Please, please go away.
I'll be all right, if you'll please let me alone. Please.
And so we are met here today...
...facing the open sea on three points of the compass...
...to pay tribute to the men who have sailed from this port...
...and gone down to that sea, never to return.
For three centuries...
...women and children of Gloucester men have stood upon this shore and cried:
..."There go the ships".
This year, as every year...
...there are those that have waited in vain.
It shall be ever thus.
In years to come...
...women of Gloucester shall watch and wait...
...sending their prayers and faith to men over the horizon.
Men whose every day is one of life and labor uncertain...
...but men of strong faith in themselves...
...in their ships...
...and in the God who is on land and sea.
So to those of these men...
...whose last resting place is beneath the sea they loved...
...we pay our humble tribute...
...as we cast these wreaths and flowers...
...upon the waters of their outgoing tide.
