Halt!
Where are all your Touaregs and the battle, murder, and sudden death?
You know the Arabs always carry off their own dead, Major.
Wake them up in there!
Yes, sir.
The lookout tower is empty.
The place is probably bulging with Touaregs, sir.
No, I don't think so.
I'm gonna take a closer look.
Attack if I'm fired on again.
Yes, sir.
Major Beaujolais with a relief column from Fort Tokotu.
Call your officer and tell...
Give me your rope. I'm going over the wall.
Attack if you don't hear from me in 10 minutes.
May I ask a question, sir?
They're all dead.
Dead, sir? Exactly. Dead.
It may be a trap, Major. Let me go.
You are too important.
May I go, sir?
Yes.
Go over the wall and open the gates.
Keep your eyes open!
What about those 2 shots, sir?
I can ask the questions myself, Dufour.
It shouldn't have taken him this long.
No, sir.
I'm going over myself.
I'll tear the place down if you're not out in 5 minutes.
All right.
Bugler!
Bugler!
Bugler! Answer me!
Bugler!
Bugler!
Halt!
I'm glad to see you, sir.
Thanks.
Come here.
Not a soul alive in the place.
No sign of an enemy?
No, sir.
They're dead.
Yes, sir.
Where's the bugler?
Look for him if you want to. I have.
No thanks, sir.
Up here is a young man who died peacefully.
Beside him is a sergeant with a French bayonet through his heart.
Where, sir?
Never mind.
I have several questions
I'd like to ask, sir.
I have a few myself.
We'll camp in the oasis tonight.
Tomorrow, I'll get to the bottom of this if I have to take a trip to the next world.
Touaregs!
Fall back on the oasis.
Break ranks and fall back to the oasis!
Dufour, I want 2 men to go back to Fort Tokotu for reinforcements.
Right, sir. We'll go, sir.
Good.
Now, one of you must get through.
Split up when you get in the desert.
Have Lt. St. Andre bring his mounted Senegalese as fast as he can.
Yes, sir.
Cease firing!
Cease firing.
Look, Major!
There goes the evidence.
Of what, sir?
I don't know.
Dufour, how am I gonna make a report about this?
If I say exactly what's happened, they'll say I'm mad at Headquarters.
I think this is a silly game!
For that remark, Ghastly Gussie, you are reduced from captain to a common seaman!
How much longer do I have to be a common seaman, Admiral?
Well, it takes time to work up.
You know, Digby,
John's a good worker for a common seaman.
It, uh, it wouldn't be a good idea to promote him.
That's right, Beau.
He might stop working.
I knew something would happen.
Are you hit?
Y
- Yes, sir.
Well, come ashore.
And bring the ships.
Are you hurt much?
Yeah. No.
Are you all right?
Well...
Now be careful. It hit pretty hard.
Don't bump that leg.
Here we are.
Lie down... Steady.
...and we'll examine the wound.
Do you... Do you want to bite on a bullet?
That's what they always do in books.
Will... will I get promoted if I do?
If you don't shout.
I... I won't shout.
I'm ready, Captain.
Sit on him. Yes, sir.
Wait till Aunt Patricia hears about this.
There it is.
Bandage him, Isobel.
Look, Digby.
Oh, that must have hurt going in.
Not half as much as it did coming out!
You're very brave.
Oh, no, I'm not.
I just wanted to be promoted.
I'm proud of you, John.
You'll be knighted and given a Viking's funeral.
No! Really, Beau? I... I mean, Admiral?
Kneel.
Ooh.
I dub you Sir John Geste, Knight.
Rise, Sir Knight. Get a ship ready, Captain.
Right, sir.
Sir John Geste.
Wait a minute.
A Viking always has to be buried with a dog at his feet.
There's one on the table in the study.
I'll go and get it.
Isobel, I think this is awfully silly.
I never speak to common sailors.
John, I...
Sir John!
Sir John, I think you're as silly as the rest of them.
Here it is.
Ah. Very good, Captain.
Put it at Sir John's feet, light the fire and cast off.
Yes, sir.
Hats off!
Attention!
Bugler, blow the last post.
Are you crying because you're proud or because you're wounded?
Because I'm proud!
There, that's what I want when my turn comes.
I'd give anything to have a Viking's funeral, with a dog at my feet and the last post blown for me.
If it weren't too much trouble.
Beau, it isn't too much trouble.
I'll give you one whenever you like.
Here comes Aunt Patricia.
Wait till she hears about John's leg.
Sir John. And you keep your mouth shut.
Children. I want to introduce you to an old friend of mine.
Captain Henri de Beaujolais.
Henri, this is Michael Geste.
How do you do, sir?
And Digby.
How do you do, sir?
And John, the youngest brother.
How do you do, sir?
And this is Isobel Rivers, my ward.
And Augustus Brandon,
Sir Hector's nephew.
How do you do, sir?
Aunt Patricia, John got a bullet in his leg and Beau took it out with a penknife!
Oh, John!
It's... it's nothing, Aunt Patricia.
It... it didn't even hurt.
Let me see, John.
An excellent job of surgery!
We couldn't do better than that in the Foreign Legion.
Which is Beau?
Oh, I am, sir.
You have a very steady hand.
Well, I'm very glad to have met you all.
Goodbye.
As soon as I get old enough,
I'm going to join the Foreign Legion.
That's exactly what I was thinking.
Me, too.
But of course, we'd have to leave Aunt Patricia.
Oh.
That's right.
Oh, I suppose we'll have to give it up.
She'll always need some men around to protect her.
I like your family, Patricia.
Especially the Gestes?
Yes. Why do you ask? Everybody does.
Who are they? Orphans.
Three young gentlemen of fortune that I've adopted.
And Augustus is Sir
Hector's heir, I suppose?
Mmm-hmm. If Sir Hector leaves him anything to inherit.
Has he really managed to go through everything?
Only the sapphire is left.
I'm sorry, Patricia.
Oh, I don't mind for myself. It's the children.
I want to raise them and give them a chance in life.
I'm a little desperate about that.
And I suppose Sir Hector will be a little desperate the next time he comes home?
Mmm. He has to be desperate to come home.
Incidentally, before I go, may I see this fabulous sapphire of Sir Hector's?
I've been hearing about it clear across the world.
Of course.
You know, I read this in a book somewhere.
Do you mean to tell me in the Foreign
Legion they read adventure stories?
This gets better and better.
This is called the Priests' Refuge.
In Oliver Cromwell's time, the Brandons used to hide them here.
Hmm!
Takes your breath away.
That's the great-great- grandfather of all sapphires.
It's the one thing Sir
Hector really loves.
Everything else he has but the estate has been gambled away.
Hasn't it a history?
Isn't it supposed to bring bad luck to its owners?
Bad luck? Do you think you could ever make any Brandon believe there was bad luck in having 30,000 pounds?
Well, we're not going to get out today.
Let's play something in the house.
What could we play, Beau?
We could play King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table.
How do you play that?
Well, I'm King Arthur.
First, you put me in this suit of armor...
Aunt Pat wouldn't like that.
I'll take the blame if she finds out.
Digby, you're Sir Lancelot.
John, you're Sir Gawaine.
Isobel is Queen Guinevere.
And, Gussie, you can be Sir Mordred.
Who's Sir Mordred?
He's the knight who betrayed King Arthur.
Oh, I like that.
Digby, John, and Gussie will have to get swords and helmets.
Now, help me into this suit of armor before you go.
Can you manage?
I... I think so.
Oh! Oh.
We'll be back in a minute, Sire.
Can you breathe all right?
Fairly well.
Go, my people!
That will be all, Burdon.
Ram Singh.
Aunt Pat!
Well, there goes our king.
Thank you, Ram Singh.
Beau, Beau, are you all right?
Yes. Help me out.
What was that man with the towel on his head doing here?
I don't know.
You were close enough to hear what he was saying.
Oh, I suppose I'll have to tell you.
He was from the Arabs.
He wanted me to fight on their side against the Foreign Legion.
And... and he asked
Aunt Pat if I could go.
What did Aunt Pat say?
Well... well, no.
It sounds like a big lie to me, John.
Just a moment, Digby.
Are you doubting the word of King Arthur?
Why, no, Sire.
Are you, John?
I didn't say a word, Sire.
Excuse me.
I hope I'm not intruding.
Oh, no, Aunt Pat. We were just...
Please go on, Isobel.
May I?
Aren't you a little old for those childish games, Beau?
Aren't you a little young for those grown-up cigars, Gussie?
Is he still there?
Yes. Don't make so much noise.
What's the difference? He knows we're after him now.
All right. Then let's get to work.
Let's not act hastily.
This requires some preparation.
All we need to do is move the couch.
He'll move fast. We gotta watch out for him.
Well, one of us on each side.
And have him walk out right between us?
I can see you haven't done much of this sort of thing, Digby.
Now, you move the couch and I'll cover the ground.
The minute he shows his head,
I'll be on him like a tiger.
Now look, I flushed him,
I stood watch while you armed yourself.
It's up to you to move the couch.
Sorry, old boy, I don't see it your way.
Well, then we'll need a third party to move the couch while we do the dirty work.
John.
No, he's too busy. We can't disturb him.
What's more important than this?
When you get a little older you'll realize. Love.
Love?
You mean he's in love with Isobel?
Horribly. Worst case I've ever seen.
Well, he has my blessing.
Here he comes!
Cute little fellow, isn't he?
Probably been here for years.
Has a family, too, I suppose.
Well, go ahead, Beau.
After all, it's your room.
It must be your mouse.
Digby, we can't go down and face all the others with blood all over our hands, can we?
No.
Remind me tonight to bring him up some cheese, will you?
Did you have fun?
Think of him behind that couch.
Same form of rodent.
Thank you.
The Gestes are such witty fellows to themselves.
Ghastly!
If I could only...
Shush!
Don't argue with the heir, Digby.
Thank you.
A telegram.
First one in 5 years.
Who's it for, Burdon?
Her Ladyship, sir.
I wonder if anything's happened to Sir Hector.
Now, please don't start reciting the will, Gussie, until we find out definitely.
Telegram, Madam.
Oh, thank you, Burdon.
Sir Hector is well, I trust?
Quite well, Augustus.
And we are going to have a visit from him.
Oh.
That's splendid.
I don't understand.
He never comes home this time of year.
Only because he's never needed money at this time of the year before, Augustus.
Well, I don't see what more he expects to get out of the estate.
You forget the Blue Water.
Why, he wouldn't sell the
Blue Water, would he, Aunt Pat?
I'm afraid that's what he intends doing.
Why, there wouldn't be anything left!
Excuse me.
Aunt Pat, would you show us the
Blue Water before you go?
We may not get another chance to see it.
Very well. Burdon.
Yes, Madam?
Will you come to the Priests'
Refuge with me, please?
And bring a candle. Yes, Madam.
Well, why are we all so glum?
Selling the Blue Water isn't the end of everything, is it?
It is for Gussie.
Poor Aunt Pat.
She probably doesn't mind losing the Blue Water.
It's having Sir Hector around again.
Well, that's a splendid way to talk about your benefactor.
Where would you be if it weren't for him?
I don't know, Ghastly, but not with you, at any rate.
We couldn't quietly arrange to dispose of Sir Hector in some way before he gets home, could we?
Oh, nothing gory, of course.
Thank you, Burdon.
It looks like a piece of sky that had become solid, with sunlight imprisoned in it.
Cold sunlight.
Cold as the unhappiness it has brought so many people.
Well, must have blown a fuse.
Isobel, you're the closest. Try the switch.
So somebody turned them off.
Another Geste joke?
It's... It's gone!
Why... why, it's impossible!
Somebody in this room took it.
Now, don't be any more of an ass than you can help, Ghastly.
There's no one in this room but the family. Well?
It seems there's someone here with a sense of humor all his own.
Your joke, Augustus?
Me? No, Aunt, really. I... I swear it.
You, John?
No, Aunt Pat.
Digby?
Positively not.
Beau?
I didn't take the Blue Water.
Surely not... Oh, no, Aunt.
I'm very much afraid someone is lying.
Put it back, John.
I said I didn't take it.
Suppose you put it back. Suppose you do.
Whatever the humor of the joke, it's rather bad taste to prolong it.
I think we're agreed on that.
Perhaps our humorist wouldn't mind returning the Blue
Water the way he got it, in the darkness.
Turn off the lights, Isobel.
Turn them on, Isobel.
I was trying to catch the thief. So was I.
Whoever took the Blue
Water has had his chance.
I don't want a scandal in Brandon Abbas.
I will leave the box on the table until morning.
If the Blue Water is not back by then, of course, I shall have to call the police.
Good night.
Have we a magician here?
Or is Brandon Abbas haunted?
Well, there's Augustus.
What about you?
Please don't quarrel.
Somebody's just joking.
You don't joke about 30,000 pounds.
But this is dreadful.
It's got to be a joke.
You go to bed, Isobel.
We know it wasn't you.
Gussie,
I hate to do this, but it's necessary.
Now, then, n-n-n-now, wait a minute!
Now... now, wait a minute!
Wait a minute! I... I...
Wouldn't it be wonderful if he really did have it?
Be sure and look in his mouth, Digby.
You know, I'm really very sorry you didn't have it on you, Ghastly.
I wish I could search you.
I'd wager I'd find the Blue Water.
And if one of you is to blame, then all of you are because you always stick together.
Well, what's the next step?
We all search each other?
No, if I have a brother who's a thief,
I'd rather not know about it till he sends me my share of the loot.
Let's go to bed.
Quite an evening.
Yes.
Isobel didn't do it.
No.
Burdon didn't.
No.
Gussie?
You searched him, didn't you?
Well, there's just us left.
Well, I didn't take the thing.
Neither did I.
It'll probably be back in its little box in the morning.
Get some sleep.
Good night.
What are you doing?
Searching the room.
I thought Gussie might have hidden it somewhere when the lights were out.
We needn't bother any more.
Read this.
When did you get it?
It was under my door when
I woke up this morning.
He must have left it in the night.
Yes.
Where do you think he went?
Where would you go if you wanted to disappear completely and still have some excitement?
Foreign Legion.
So would Beau.
Pardon me, Mr. John, but, uh, Mr. Digby left me this note to deliver to you at 9:00, sir.
Thank you, Burdon. Yes, sir.
Isobel,
Beau left a note for Digby last night and now Digby has left a note for me.
"Dear John:
"It wasn't Beau, but me.
"Love to Isobel,
"a sneer to Gussie, and a command to you.
"Grow up to be a credit to those two criminals,
Beau and Digby. "
Why did they run away?
Beau did it to shield Digby and me.
Digby wouldn't let him take the blame alone.
I should have known what Digby was going to do last night.
What are you going to do?
Don't you know?
I think at least one of the
Gestes ought to kiss you goodbye.
I've been in love with you for a very long time.
I just didn't know how to say it.
Now that I do know, I...
It's too late.
It's not too late.
But I couldn't ask you to wait for me.
Yes, you could.
Goodbye, Isobel.
John.
John, may I ask you a silly question, just once and for all?
I know the answer, but I want to hear you say it.
All right.
Did you take the Blue Water?
If I'd have stolen anything from Brandon Abbas, it would have been you.
Section, halt!
Right face!
Attention!
Company, attention!
Present arms!
Dismissed!
Show me your hands.
Turn them over. Higher!
Never have done a day's work in your life, have you?
Yes, sir.
I'll manicure those before we're through.
You'll do to carry water.
You're not big enough to be a soldier.
You think I'm big enough to be a soldier, Sarge?
Shut up!
Well.
A countryman of mine.
So you decided to re-enlist, eh, Rasinoff?
Yes, Sergeant.
You must be as big a fool as you are a thief.
Discipline makes the strength of armies.
It is necessary that superiors obtain from their subordinates immediate obedience without murmuring.
Discipline will be firm, but it will also be fatherly.
Officers must use psychology in dealing with men.
Any questions about the regulations?
I am Sgt. Markoff.
I make soldiers out of scum like you and I don't do it gently.
You're the sloppiest looking lot I've ever seen.
It's up to me to prevent you from becoming a disgrace to the Regiment.
And I will prevent that if I have to kill half of you with work.
But the half that lives will be soldiers.
I promise you.
Corporal, take them to the barracks.
Yes, Sergeant.
Left face!
Follow me!
Forward march!
Markoff!
I just witnessed that little exhibition of yours, Markoff.
I don't like it!
You have to be strict with scum like that, sir.
They're men! They have their rights, guaranteed with the regulations.
I'll keep within the regulations, sir.
You're a good soldier, Markoff, but I doubt if you're a good sergeant.
If you're not, you won't last long in the Legion.
Watch your step, or I'll break you.
That's all.
Is this Markoff gonna be our sergeant from now on?
Yes. He's a madman.
He was expelled from the Siberian penal colonies for cruelty.
Then he entered the Legion and rose from the ranks.
Enter the third robber.
Beau! Dig!
How are you?
I'm glad to see you.
You confounded nuisance!
You wouldn't do anything original like staying at home, would you?
Not without my older brothers to take care of me.
Why couldn't you join the
Royal Northwest Mounted Police?
We just ran out so we wouldn't have you on our hands anymore.
You mean you ran out on me and left me to face the police.
Well, have it your own way.
We're stuck with you for five years now.
Say, how's everybody at home?
Well, but not happy.
Oh, that's too bad.
Say, wouldn't it be horrible if Ghastly Gussie should suddenly appear here, too?
Ooh, horrible!
Well, the Three Musketeers.
One for all, and all for nothing.
Ahem, ahem, ahem.
Oh, excuse me, two of my friends,
Mr. McMonigal and Mr. Miller.
My brothers, Beau and Digby.
How do you do? Glad to meet you.
And... and I am Rasinoff.
He was Rasinoff! You know, he hasn't been the same since he found out your brother could buy a drink.
Well, I guess this calls for a drink on me.
Will you join us?
Don't be foolish!
May... may I accompany you?
If you insist.
Well, I insist.
"For France beneath Sahara's sky"
"For France, no matter whether"
"we live or we die"
"Noble birth"
"Or beggars of the earth"
"Men of disgrace and of glory"
"Low or great, we share an equal fate"
"No Legionnaire tells his story"
"For France"
Shh.
Sounds worse than a battle.
And they fight it every night.
Wait till Hank joins in.
It'll sound like a massacre.
Aw, you just give me a couple of nights to get tuned up.
Shh.
Listen, Beau.
We can't talk in here.
Talk?
We can't even sleep.
Then let's take our blankets and sleep outside.
Think we'll get picked up by the guard?
Let's humor the child.
This is no place for high-class jewel thieves.
Good night, gentlemen.
Say.
Ain't you gonna stay for the concert?
Listen, we've got to draw the line someplace and you ain't gonna sleep next to us.
Did you hear what the one called John said?
Who?
Get that man out of our boudoir.
They're jewel thieves!
Well, what'd you expect to meet in the Legion, bankers?
Good night.
Good night.
Well, isn't anybody going to say a word?
You young pup, we're both so disgusted with you we're speechless.
I'm no worse than either of you.
There's something in what he says, Beau.
I insist I'm worse than he is, he didn't steal the Blue Water.
Neither did you.
No, as a matter of fact,
I've got it.
I'll be frank with you, gentlemen.
I've got it.
I intend to sell it for 30,000 pounds sometime in the future and live a life of ease in Paris, surrounded by whiskey, ladies and laughter.
Well, that's funny.
I'm going to sell it and go to Paris, too.
Only I don't want any laughter.
One thing I counted on was my younger brother leading an upright life while I spent my ill-gotten gains.
Yes, I was counting on him, too.
If you don't mind my saying so, the great sapphire is in my possession.
And as soon as I can arrange to sell it,
I'm going to the South Seas, buy a plantation and start trading in copra.
He puts us both to shame, doesn't he, Beau?
Let's put him to death and keep his share.
All right.
Oh, we'll have to find it first.
Let's wait till the morning.
I don't like searching people in the dark.
Good night.
Good night.
Good night.
What the...
Thief!
I... I... I lost my way.
I... I was going for a drink.
Liar, you were trying to rob him.
No, I didn't know where I was going.
I was walking in my sleep.
You were trying to rob him, I know you from before, Rasinoff!
No, I... I... I... I wasn't!
Thief!
Quiet! On the table with him!
He's had enough! Get out of here!
Take it easy, Beau, there's too many of them.
Shh.
The guards.
You didn't wait very long to start your old tricks, huh?
But Sergeant, they had... Silence!
An accident.
Yes, Sergeant.
Go to the washstand and bathe your hands.
Yes, Sergeant.
Save your first-aid treatments for yourselves after this.
You'll need 'em. I promise you!
Who were you trying to rob?
The one named Beau.
Of what?
He has money.
You lie.
You wouldn't take that risk for a little money.
Well, he has a jewel.
Tell me the truth.
It is the truth, I swear it.
They have a great jewel, worth
30,000 pounds that they stole.
They? The other two.
They are brothers, and they're waiting for a chance to sell it.
But he is the leader.
He carries it.
I've watched him.
What about the two Americans?
Well.
They are just friends.
Make sure you're telling me the truth.
I am.
I am!
You know,
I think I can help you get that jewel.
Why...
Why, that's what I hoped.
I'm sure you did.
In a week we go to relieve the garrison at Fort Zinderneuf.
It can be arranged there.
But there are three of them, and... and the two friends.
Some of the company go to Fort Tokotu for mounted infantry training.
It can be arranged.
And if there's no jewel, you'll get a wooden jewel box.
I promise you.
But... but he has it.
I'm sure of it.
Go back to the barracks.
Today marks the end of your training.
You are now soldiers, in the service of France.
We are here on the desert as guardians of 20 millions of natives.
They look to us for the protection and justice that is the tradition of the Foreign Legion.
Yours is a high duty, and a hard one.
The odds are great.
It is our allegiance to France and our debt to civilization to uphold that tradition.
Some of you are assigned with me to Fort Zinderneuf.
Another detachment will go to Fort Tokotu for further training in the mounted company.
Select your men for Tokotu, Sergeant.
McMonigal, 3 steps forward.
Miller!
Benoff!
Personne!
Andre!
Diggs!
Costaud!
Baker!
Noyaki!
Lacoste!
Brun!
Schmidt!
Vandenecker!
Laumange!
Ruclous!
Dirla!
Aloof!
Corporal Golas, take charge of the detachment.
Tokotu party, fall in!
Right shoulder arms!
Right face!
Forward march!
Present arms!
Present arms!
Center dress!
Front!
Count off!
Three.
Four.
One.
Two.
Three.
Four.
Right shoulder arms!
Detail in order, sir.
Right by fours, right!
Forward march!
Present arms!
Present arms!
Right shoulder arms!
Look where you're going. I'm sorry.
Do that again, blubber-face, and I'll brain you.
He'll be gibbering like
Krenke in a little while.
We all will.
I wouldn't mind if it would annoy Markoff.
Come on, bring on that coffee!
Coffee!
Let's try to get Krenke to drink a little.
So this is the cafard!
Did the Captain back in Paris tell you about his red, white and blue skull?
Yes.
He was lucky.
Can't we do something for him?
We can help him to die, that's all.
How's Lt. Martin?
Worse.
I haven't prayed in a long time, but I'm going to pray for him.
You'd better!
Think of Markoff in command!
I wonder where Renault and
Renouf are this morning?
Dead, with their mouths full of sand.
It's no use to desert.
Oh, what's the difference whether you get death inside the walls or out?
There's a chance inside.
Not if the Lieutenant dies.
You don't have to be the pigs.
You can be the butcher.
And then what?
Morocco, all of us.
We leave that pig Markoff well stuck.
And you'd be well stuck before you ever got to Morocco.
The Arabs would never dare attack so large a group.
No, but the French Army would.
Do you know what I think of the French Army?
After we kill Markoff and you,
I'm gonna tear off this uniform...
Cut it out.
What's going on in here?
Schwartz was trying to eat too fast again.
Everybody out on the parade ground.
Renault and Renouf are back!
Any orders this morning, sir?
No, you take over, Markoff.
The scouts brought back our two deserters, sir.
Lock them up.
We'll send them to Tokotu for court martial in a few days.
The men need a lesson, Lieutenant.
Locking them up won't...
Who's in command of this fort?
You are, sir.
Don't make the mistake of forgetting that or you'll join the deserters in the cell.
That's all.
Yes, sir.
Attention!
Stand aside!
Where are they?
They're outside, sir.
Bring them in.
Bring them in!
Attention!
So you decided to come back to us, huh?
Yes, Sergeant.
After the desert, Zinderneuf doesn't seem so bad, huh?
No, Sergeant.
Speak up!
No, Sergeant.
The punishment for desertion is death by the firing squad.
But I'm going to be merciful.
You can escape again.
Oh, no!
You mean you want to stay here and be executed?
Water! Water!
On your feet!
I insist that you escape.
No... no, let us stay!
Yeah, give us a...
Get out!
Out!
Drive them out where you found them.
Keep them away from the oasis.
I'm glad Digby isn't here.
I wish you weren't.
Any more of you want to desert?
If you do, you can go now.
I won't stop you.
Later you may wish you had taken my offer.
I promise you.
Rasinoff!
You can close the gates now.
How do you feel tonight, Lieutenant?
I'm dying.
I hope not, sir.
I'm going to die and be buried under the sand and forgotten.
When I was a little boy,
I thought soldiers always died in battles.
I didn't know there were so many soldiers and so few battles and so many fevers.
Get word to Beaujolais at Tokotu.
Have him send another officer.
You'll be in command until then.
Yes, sir.
The men must be led, not driven.
Remember, you'll answer to the man who takes my place.
Yes, sir.
Sergeant! Have you...
Attention!
Lt. Martin is dead.
I am now in command.
From this moment on, discipline at Fort
Zinderneuf will be severe.
I promise you!
Don't tell me he took your appetites away.
He'll take more than that away before long.
Glock, go to the door, warn us if anyone comes.
Markoff has been asking for it, and now he's going to get it.
Can't you see a mutiny is what Markoff wants?
If he puts it down, he'll be a hero.
And you're the one who would help him put it down, Maris.
Let him hang himself.
Lt. Martin's death gives him enough rope.
When his superior officers learn what he's already done, he'll go to prison for life!
Listen to our little Sergeant-lover.
Our troubles are all over if we bring Markoff a bunch of posies every morning.
You don't want to stay here and die like rats in a trap, do you?
No!
And let that madman squeeze every drop of blood out of you and drive you out on the desert like he did Renouf and Renault, do you?
No!
We're 50 against one. How long are you going to keep on licking the boots that kick you?
Those stripes on his sleeve won't stop a rifle bullet.
Let's get him now! I'm with you!
You fools!
Don't listen to him! He'll never get away with it!
50 against 2!
50 against the legion!
Shut up, you yellow liver!
Wait a minute.
I don't know much about mutinies, but I do know it isn't good form to plan them at the top of your voice.
Where do you stand?
Well, I don't like Markoff, but also I don't like you.
50 against 3!
Make it 4.
Who else?
These 3 won't bother us.
Rasinoff?
He's with Markoff, and he goes with Markoff.
After you kill Markoff, what?
We'll get out of this hole, and we go to Morocco.
Markoff has two Arab scouts outside.
The minute they see anything's wrong, they'll ride to Tokotu for help.
We'll have too much of a start.
Not for the camel corps.
Talk, talk, talk! Let's decide!
You're right.
All those with me, on your feet!
I give you one more chance to change your mind.
Schwartz, there'll be a flag flying out there in the morning that I swore to uphold.
Armies of good men have died for it, gladly.
It's a battle flag and it's a flag of victory.
I'm rather proud to be under it.
And I wouldn't want to go out in the morning like you and know that I was going to be a traitor to it.
We have a patriot!
He wouldn't be so patriotic if he had a slit in his belly.
Would you like to try putting one there?
I will! Wait!
If Markoff hears, he'll send his scouts to Tokotu!
We'll get him right now!
No, we can't march at night. Wait until morning.
Voisin's right, get back!
We'll get him in the morning on parade.
The man nearest Markoff shoots him.
The next one shoots
Rasinoff, then these three.
That's right.
Suppose one of them sneaks out and warns Markoff?
I'll warn the guards, if anybody sticks his head out they'll shoot.
You're full of plans.
Let's get 'em right now.
Shut up, Renoir! Go ahead, Voisin!
Nobody leaves this room!
What can we do?
Outside of prayer, I can't think of a thing.
You're the older brother, it's up to you.
When the shooting starts, we just shoot at everybody, it makes it simpler.
Who?
Voisin!
Well?
They mutiny in the morning, on parade.
All of them?
The English brothers and Maris are faithful.
I'm supposed to warn the guards.
Never mind the guards.
Go on back and go to sleep.
I'll pay you a quiet little call later.
Glock will be on the door.
Now, but not later.
Are they with us? To a man.
You'd better take him out.
Nobody leaves this room, not even Krenke.
Put your clothes on.
Leave your boots off.
We're going to put down an attempted mutiny.
We'll disarm the sentries first.
Before this is over, we'll have the jewel.
Come on.
Get up. Quietly.
One sound out of you and it'll be your last.
Wake Maris, Voisin, and the brothers.
Rasinoff, stay here.
Shoot anyone that moves.
The rest of you gather up the rifles and bring them out.
And don't drop any of them!
Maris, Voisin, go back and get the rest of them.
There's another little matter I almost forgot.
The jewel you stole.
I want it.
I have no jewel.
I know you have.
I haven't.
Are you sure?
Quite sure.
I advise you to change your mind.
Otherwise, when this is over, I may have to shoot you to make sure.
I understand, Sergeant.
You mean you'd rather not hand it over now and save your life?
No, Sergeant.
That's very unfortunate, for you.
Arm yourselves.
Open fire on them if they attempt to rush us.
Attention!
The attempt at mutiny is over, my children.
You bungled it so much it wasn't really a mutiny.
But you'll be punished as though it were.
Maris, Rasinoff. You two, cover them in the yard!
Anyone that makes a false move won't have to stand trial.
By twos, fall in!
Forward march!
Pig!
You're the pig!
Column left.
Section halt!
Close in!
Left face!
And now, you scum, it's my turn.
I'm going to give you a lesson in putting down an attempted mutiny that'll be the last thing you'll ever see.
Maybe this'll make you die happy.
Markoff thanks you.
When he's an officer and has the Legion of Honor, he'll think often of the stupid, blundering pigs that put him where he is.
Smith, Jones, fall in here.
Schwartz, Renoir, line up, backs to the gate.
Now, my children, you're going to see the regulations carried out to the letter.
The punishment for mutiny is death.
Silence!
You two, about face.
These 2 pigs deserve to be first.
And the honor of killing them belongs to the two most loyal men in the fort.
Ready! Aim!
Do you hear me?
Very plainly!
Then do your duty!
It's not our duty to shoot down unarmed men.
Maybe you'd rather be on the other side, ahead of Schwartz and Renoir?
I'll give you one more chance. Ready! Aim!
You refuse to obey your superior?
I don't think you'll shoot, Markoff.
You haven't enough men behind you now.
You forget I wanted an excuse.
Here's your excuse.
Very well.
You each get three in the belly.
Keep them covered.
Touaregs coming, a great harka. We were surprised!
Get through to Fort Tokotu and tell them we must have help!
It will be done.
Prepare for action. The Arabs.
Bugler, sound the alarm!
Pass out the arms and ammunition.
Get your rifles.
Take your posts. Maris,
Voisin, Rasinoff. Follow me.
Here. Thanks.
Oh, those beautiful Touaregs.
Didn't I tell you not to worry?
I suppose you had this all worked out.
Everything but having to fight in our underwear, and I apologize for that.
Keep it up, you scum! Keep shooting!
You'll get a chance yet to die with your boots on!
Bugler! Run up the colors!
Now we've got something to fight under!
Rapid fire, you scum! Rapid fire!
Bugler, sound cease firing!
Anybody hit?
No, Sergeant.
They'll get down to sharp-shooting later.
Schwartz. Voisin. More ammunition.
Maris. Renoir.
Coffee and bread for everybody.
Rasinoff.
Take half the men below.
Get them properly dressed.
Then the other half, if there's no attack.
Fall out. Go below.
Fall out. Go below.
At least the indecent part of this fight is nearly over.
Fall out. Go below. Fall out. Go below.
Maybe the Arabs will save me the trouble.
You're in this, too, Sergeant.
Silence!
Three hours since their first attack.
Maybe they are digging in, Sergeant.
When they return, it'll be slowly and taking aim.
Schwartz.
Yes, Sergeant.
Get up in the tower.
Watch the palm trees in the oasis.
They can shoot down on us from there.
Maybe you can see the route to Morocco before they get you.
That's the place for our mutineers.
Up on a roost like pigeons.
If I could only afford to waste them all.
Why don't they come?
Here they come!
Bugler, sound the alarm!
Turn from your place again, and I'll blow your head off.
Bugler, sound cease firing!
Everybody does his duty at
Zinderneuf, dead or alive.
We'll make those Arabs think we've got a thousand men.
The rest of the bullets you stop won't hurt as much as that first one.
That settles the big pig.
Would you like to take the position of honor next, Rasinoff?
No, Sergeant. No?
No.
Voisin.
Up in the tower.
I'm rewarding you for betraying your friends.
You can see them all from the tower.
On the double.
All right?
All right.
Here they come!
Stand to! Rapid fire! Rapid fire!
They've had enough again. Give it to them!
Rapid fire! Rapid fire!
Bugler, sound cease firing!
Charming fellow, our Sergeant.
A trifle uncouth, but the best soldier we'll ever see.
Rasinoff, how many left?
12, Sergeant.
You'll all be with these others in a little while.
You'll do your duty better dead than you ever did alive.
Take 10 minutes below for food and rest.
Two men at a time.
Smith. Jones. Go first.
If you hear the bugle, come back on the double. Quick.
Rasinoff.
Go up in the tower.
No!
No, no, Sergeant, please.
Up in the tower and dream about the jewel in the moonlight.
March!
Now you can see.
Tired?
A little.
Looks rather bad, doesn't it?
Rather.
Do you mind?
A little.
Isobel?
Yes.
I'm sorry, John.
Let's not go into that, Beau.
Nobody asked me to come here.
I remember what Ghastly
Gussie said one time:
"The Gestes always stick together. "
Hmm.
Digby's probably on his way here now.
He'd better be.
John.
Somebody always gets out of these things.
It might be you.
The Gestes always stick together.
Well, if they shouldn't, would you do me a favor?
Of course.
Thanks.
In my coat are two letters and a packet.
One letter and the packet goes to Aunt Pat.
The other letter stays here with me.
All right.
Could I do you a favor, if, uh, things happen to be the other way around?
Just tell Isobel that...
Just tell her something.
Older brother takes care of everything.
I promise you.
Let's get some rest, John.
Yeah, all right.
No attack since dawn.
That's a long time for them.
Are they still there, Rasinoff?
Yes, Sergeant, but they're... they're moving around a lot.
That means the holy men are arguing for one more attack.
They've lost their stomach for it.
The next attack will be the last one.
No sign of any relief from Tokotu.
Well, we'll show them we're not only awake, but merry and bright.
Bugler.
Yes, Sergeant.
Blow every call they ever taught you!
Now, my children,
I want some happy laughter. Lots of it.
Seven is going to sound like 70.
Laugh, Renoir!
Maris, pick it up!
Bugler!
Jones.
Smith.
Rasinoff, what's the matter with you?
Me? Yes, you!
Laugh, you human jackal!
Run from embrasure to embrasure and fire!
We'll make them think we're still fully manned.
Bugler, sound the alarm!
Beau.
Keep firing, or I'll blow your back out!
March!
Cease firing!
They won't come back again.
They've had enough of Zinderneuf.
But just in case.
Leave my brother's body alone.
Go below and bring me some bread and wine.
If you touch him, I'll kill you.
Do as I tell you. I'm still in command here.
Look.
Look at them.
They come when I want them.
They go when I don't need them anymore.
They're beaten.
But they've put down a mutiny for me.
They've given me the Legion of Honor, and they've made me an officer.
So he had no jewel, huh?
I told you to leave my brother's body alone.
This is all I wanted.
I'm a rich man now, thanks to you and that...
Good. Armed attack on a superior in the face of the enemy.
I court martial you myself.
I find you guilty and
I sentence you to death.
You get six in the belly.
Listen to me.
I haven't got much breath.
Leave the public letter in Markoff's hand.
Take the packet and the other letter home to Aunt Pat.
Yes, Beau.
Go to Egypt.
Promise?
I promise.
Tell Digby I was sorry
I couldn't wait for him.
Lovely sound, but a little late.
John.
John!
John!
Bugler.
Bugler.
Bugler, answer me!
Bugler.
Bugler!
Halt!
I'm glad to see you, sir.
Thanks. Come here.
There's not a soul alive in the place.
No sign of an enemy?
No, sir.
But they're dead.
Yes, sir.
Where's the bugler?
Look for him if you want to. I have.
No, thanks, sir.
Touaregs.
Fall back on the oasis.
Cease firing.
Cease firing!
John.
Dig!
Dig, Beau's dead.
I know.
I was there.
Someday, John, we'll be able to talk about him.
Not now.
Look. What's that?
That?
That's a Viking's funeral.
I knew you wouldn't forget.
He wouldn't have, if it had been me.
Well, what do we do now?
I've been playing Arab, but they're over their surprise now.
We've got to get out of here.
Where? Egypt.
Dig.
Did he have a dog at his feet?
Markoff.
That burning fort makes a pretty sight, don't it?
Not if our friends are in there being roasted instead of hiding out here in the sand hills like I think they are!
Friends! You mean Beau! Digby! John!
Hank! Hank! Buddy!
I knew we'd find you if we rode around and talked loud enough.
We wouldn't have any more company, would we?
He's in the fort.
Oh.
God rest his soul. Come on.
How many would you say?
40 or 50.
Look at that water.
Well, let's start shooting.
No, wait a minute.
I'll go up there and start blowing the bugle.
You three open fire from here.
I'll wave as if there were men behind me.
They'll think they're being attacked by the whole legion.
We hope.
Don't shoot until I give you the signal.
Good luck, Dig.
Good luck.
Dig!
Mr. John.
Hello, Burdon.
I beg your pardon, sir, but
I was so glad to see you.
I'd have been insulted if you hadn't.
How is Miss Isobel?
In splendid health, sir.
Unmarried, of course? Of course, sir.
Well, may I see Lady Brandon at once?
Yes, sir. I'll call her.
Pardon me, sir, but, uh, how are Mr. Beau and Mr. Digby?
They're both dead.
John. Isobel.
John.
You're alone, John?
Yes.
Beau asked me to bring you these.
"My dear Aunt Pat.
"I was inside the suit of armor in the hall
"the day you sold the Blue
Water to the Maharajah's agent
"and received an imitation to take its place.
"When the wire from Sir Hector came,
"I thought I'd repay your devotion to us
"by giving Brandon
Abbas its first robbery.
"So the lights went out, and so did Beau.
Lovingly, Beau Geste. "
Beau Geste.
Gallant gesture.
We didn't name him wrongly, did we?
I thought I smelled gas.
That's three this year.
They haven't even the decency to leave enough for the gas bill.
I wonder why she did it.
She seemed so full of fun.
- They all end up that way.
- No, they don't.
- You're going to go the same way.
- No, I'm not. I'm not afraid of life.
Although I am not afraid of death, either.
Come on. Move on, move on. Come on.
- Good evening.
- Hello.
Shall we go somewhere?
Away from this unpleasant house?
It's not always so unpleasant. I live here.
- May I come in?
- Naturally.
Hm.
- Shall I drop in another coin?
- Do I sound like a Pianola?
Almost.
I suppose you are a great musician?
No, but I do know something about music.
Your sweetheart?
I have done enough talking for tonight.
Would you like to make some easy money?
Is there any such thing?
I heard you say that you are not afraid of life or of death.
Now, I have connections, secret, with a certain government.
I need a woman who knows how to deal with men.
- It's against Austria, of course.
- Of course.
I'd like to get some wine.
I suppose I ought to pay for it.
Cigarette?
Hm.
- You're under arrest.
- What for?
Never mind what for. We know how to take care of spies. Come on.
Austria may not care what happens to you, but you certainly do care what happens to Austria. Hm.
- Shall we go?
- Come on, let's go.
Let go!
Beg your pardon, sir.
Give her this.
Tell her to see me tomorrow at ten.
Yes, sir.
- Good night.
- Good night, sir.
Come in.
Name, please?
I'd prefer not to give my name.
As you like.
- Quite a walk, isn't it?
- I don't mind walking.
I must tell you. I could walk with you forever.
Don't smoke in here, Lieutenant.
I'm sorry, sir.
I took a lot of trouble last night, after I left, to obtain some information about you. Ha!
It took me hours to get dry.
You are the widow of Captain
Ferdinand Kolverer, who died last year.
My husband was killed in action.
As you may have guessed by now,
I am in charge... of the Secret Service of Imperial Austria.
There are times when a man's brain cannot accomplish as much as a woman's charm.
As you demonstrated last night. Ha!
You completely fooled me.
Had me arrested!
You are a clever woman, and a very loyal one.
We lost 40,000 men here, two days ago.
And here, 18,000.
Come here.
Look at those men marching.
Marching into the jaws of death.
Unless I can uncover a certain system of communication with the enemy.
So you wish me to become a spy.
You dislike the word "spy"?
Perhaps I have no right to object to any word.
You haven't. Sit down.
In return for your services,
I shall provide you with a magnificent home, servants, all the money you may need.
What appeals to me is the chance to serve my country.
It is now my duty to point out to you that the profession of a spy is the most ignoble calling on earth.
Lower than anything you may have ever experienced.
And it is dangerous, of course.
I've had an inglorious life.
It may become my good fortune to have a glorious death.
Bring the Hindau file.
This is Colonel von Hindau.
Attached to a chief of staff of our own army.
I have reason to believe that he is a traitor.
But I have been unable to prove it.
He knows every operator in my department.
Ha!
But he doesn't know you... yet!
This is your first assignment.
I am sending you the widow of Captain
Kolverer, who will enter the service as X-27.
She will receive instructions from me.
Yes. Correct.
- May I have this dance?
- May I?
I suppose you are too exhausted playing with balloons to stand up.
Certainly I'll stand up, if you'll hand me my crutches.
I beg your pardon.
Here you are. I might have known you'd be with the prettiest woman in the place.
- I'd forgotten all about you.
- Get rid of her. Sit down.
Not tonight. I've made other plans.
- Haven't we?
- Not too loud.
Well, I don't blame you.
I wish I were in your boots.
Drop me off on your way home.
Shall we?
Hey up!
You have extraordinary luck with women,
Colonel.
I can't complain.
- Can I?
- You shouldn't, tonight. Should he?
Not unless I take you away from him.
Ha-ha-ha.
Hands off.
Don't get excited, Colonel.
Have a cigarette.
Cigarette or no cigarette, you keep your hands off.
Do you want me to?
I don't know.
Let me first see your face without the mask.
One face at a time.
Lucky for you both I'm getting out here.
Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Fritz, bring the champagne.
Yes, sir.
Will you take off your cape?
Not yet.
Well, take your time.
Take off my glove.
What a soft hand!
You are wanted on the telephone, sir. I am sorry, sir.
It's the head of the Secret Service.
He insists on speaking to you, sir.
Will you excuse me a moment?
Don't stay away too long.
- Hello?
- Hindau? I hope I didn't disturb you.
No. What's wrong?
You know I have been working on a new formula for invisible ink that defies detection?
Looking for something, madam?
Where do you hide your cigarettes?
I want to smoke.
You'll not find any in this house.
My master doesn't smoke.
Shall I send out for some?
No, never mind. It's not important.
Very well, madam.
The champagne is very excellent, madam.
I am certain it is.
Don't get excited, Colonel. Have a cigarette.
What time will you be over?
Ten? Make it eleven.
I don't like to get up so early in the morning.
- Eleven would be better.
- Good night.
I hope she had time enough to look around.
Ha! She won't find anything.
I had that house searched a dozen times.
You like Russian cigarettes?
Yes. This one is marvelous.
Where did you get it?
- Out of your coat pocket.
- Oh-hoh.
- Going through my pockets already?
- Mm-hm.
Would you like a puff?
Not bad. But I think we'd better start on the champagne.
I suppose you've also had the house surrounded.
Yes. I'm sorry, it's my job.
What a charming evening we might have had... if you hadn't been a spy, and I a... traitor.
Then we might never have met.
I don't know to whom I would rather surrender.
My compliments.
I'll wait for your men in the library.
Perhaps that was the best way, for him and for us.
Good night.
I am going after the other man.
Take charge.
- Hello, Marie.
- Hello.
Hello, Marie.
- Hello, Marie.
- Hello.
All bets down.
30 on the red.
Would you mind putting your hand on my other shoulder?
Game.
34 on the red even.
Would you mind changing your tune?
Well, yes, I'll stop.
Perhaps I can bring you a bit of luck,
Captain.
Good luck or bad luck?
Good luck.
Try number... 27.
21 on the black.
27 hasn't a chance.
What will you give me if it loses?
- Anything you like.
- Suppose we start with a kiss?
Push that over onto 27.
I hope it loses.
Ready?
26 on the black even.
When do I collect?
Any time you like.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Let's have a drink before we go.
Two Bacardis.
Do you like to gamble?
I like anything that excites me.
I'm glad you came along.
I was just becoming bored.
That's one of the reasons
I think I could like you.
You excite me.
You know, most people think of death as a very ugly old man.
Thank you, sir.
I think of death as a beautiful young woman wearing flowers.
- Roses?
- Well, she might be wearing roses.
Have a cigarette.
- What makes you think of death?
- Hm. Was I thinking of death?
Two Bacardis.
I have the feeling we've met before.
Have we? When?
When? Let me see, when did we meet before?
Have you ever been wounded?
Not me. Aviators are rarely wounded.
We fly or are killed.
How about that kiss, lady?
Kiss? I was only joking.
Oh, what a charming sense of humor!
Well, good night.
You were no match for this man, who is far too clever to be trapped by a woman.
Your experience was insufficient to deal with him alone.
You had no right to assume responsibility for the arrest of a man who is worth an entire Russian division.
Your plane takes off in an hour.
Be careful with your new assignment.
Good evening.
I've come for that kiss.
You may have been joking about it, but I wasn't.
- Don't you like to be kissed?
- You are so powerful.
Don't you like powerful men?
I am glad you escaped.
Your untimely death might have disturbed my conscience.
Nonsense, it's all in the game.
Had I caught you in my country,
I'd have had you shot without hesitation.
But we're both alive yet, and you can make my last few hours in Vienna very pleasant.
Are you going to leave Vienna so soon?
I'm afraid I'll have to, or give up my profession.
It's become too dangerous.
Perhaps I can persuade you to stay.
I really don't need persuasion.
You're not going to turn me over because of a kiss?
Are you going to shoot me yourself?
Yes, if you leave me no other choice.
Your conscience, apparently, is not going to be disturbed this time.
Stay where you are.
Shoot quickly, or I'll take that plaything away from you.
Stay where you are.
I think I removed the cartridges.
This would have been quite a feather in your cap, wouldn't it?
Do you like this masquerade as well as my last one?
- You are still a clown.
- I'm a colonel in the Russian Army.
When necessary, I fly across the line, and play the clown, or the Austrian officer.
I am a soldier, but you bring something into war that doesn't belong in it.
You trick men into death with your body.
Give me a kiss.
You're a cheat and a liar.
Why don't you stay here?
Perhaps I don't always cheat and lie.
If you kept me here another minute,
I'd not only be in danger of losing my life, but of falling in love with you, you devil!
A few thousand feet higher up we might find better weather, but I doubt it.
And now your division is to attack from S-32 to V-29.
Your objective is the railhead at T-18.
That carries us through the fifth day.
On the sixth day, your division, with the 63rd and 74th, attack from N-17 to R-21.
Your objective will be the heights at Q-11 to Q-15.
Any questions?
Does the attack begin on the ninth?
Yes, at five o'clock in the morning.
Four days from now.
That's all, gentlemen.
Come on down here.
Did anyone ever tell you how pretty you are?
Come here.
Fresh from the country, aren't you?
Do they work you very hard in this magnificent establishment?
Are you going to be off duty pretty soon?
You're not going to see some young lieutenant tonight, are you?
Captain?
A major, perhaps?
Then we'll start with a colonel.
What's the matter? You want a general?
I don't care who it is.
I don't want anyone to enter or leave these headquarters without a pass issued by me.
That woman is in this hotel.
- Count ten.
- I don't want to count ten any more.
Count ten.
One, two, three, four, five...
One, two, three, four, five...
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight...
Eight, eight, nine...
Ten!
Ah.
Meow!
Me-owwww!
Come on out here.
Come on out.
Oh, she's lost.
Meow!
Come down here.
It's warm up here. Me-oww!
Come down here or get out.
Don't be angry.
All right.
Meow!
- Meow!
- Are you coming down or not?
- Count ten.
- Haven't I counted ten before?
- No.
- One, two, three...
I'm not going to count any more.
I'm tired... I'm tired.
Meow. Meow.
Meow. Meow.
Let me see a list of your maids.
- Who are the maids on the second floor?
- Day maid's Olga. Night maid's Catherine.
Catherine, eh? Is she a new maid here?
Came three days ago.
I change maids all the time.
Can't keep them.
Too many officers quartered here.
- What do you know about Catherine?
- Nothing.
Papers are all correct.
Anything wrong again?
No.
Take your hat off when you talk to a Russian officer, if you know what's good for you.
Corporal, force the door.
Who's been with you?
Office of the Guard!
Get the Office of the Guard.
Have that woman brought to my room.
Now you can tell all that to the Colonel.
Get in there.
Everybody makes mistakes.
And you carry a cat.
It has brought me good luck, so far.
- Do you call this good luck?
- I don't know yet.
Besides, I am not allowed to love anything else.
I like your masquerade.
Sit down.
I'm sorry, I'll have to search you, X-27.
Take your things off.
Is it warm enough in here? Don't catch cold.
Hm. Music!
- Did you write this?
- Yes.
Your own composition, eh?
I don't use invisible ink.
What do you call this masterpiece?
I haven't named it yet.
May I suggest you call it
The Dance Of The Russian Colonels?
Not bad. Shall I go on with my undressing?
I'm in the mood for music first.
- Would you play this?
- If you furnish the piano.
I'll furnish the piano, and the audience.
After you.
I wish I could read notes.
Let me play it for you.
I don't know what this code means.
But I have an idea that each note might mean the death of a thousand soldiers.
My poor composition.
I worked so hard on it, and now it's in ashes.
- I destroy everything dangerous to Russia.
- I'm next, I suppose?
You know the fate of spies when they're caught.
How many more hours does my fate allow me?
You have until dawn.
This is quite a feather in your cap, isn't it?
For three days and nights,
I've had no other thought but to find you.
And now I've caught you.
Isn't it strange I'd give a lot to undo it?
Why don't you let me go, then?
Don't be absurd.
Is there any other wish I can grant?
- Yes.
- What is it?
I'd like to share my last few hours on earth with you.
Do you think you can fool me as easily as you did the adjutant?
I give you my word of honor that
I no longer want anything but to be with you.
It's easy to grant you almost anything.
I think I'm falling madly in love with you.
The more you cheat and the more you lie, the more exciting you become, X-27.
I wish this night could last forever.
It will be dawn soon.
I don't understand why you should choose a road that leads to such a death.
Not a bad death, to die for my country.
It's better than gas or the river.
What has gas or the river to do with you?
Nothing. Now.
Let's not talk of death any more.
This is our last drink together.
What shall we drink to?
- To love.
- To love and excitement.
To love and excitement.
- What did you put into this wine?
- Only a few drops of sleep.
You think you can get away?
Here!
Where are you going? Where's your pass?
Ink's still wet, huh?
I wish I were an officer. Go ahead.
Your plane will leave for Vienna in two hours.
- Name?
- Nikolai Chemochenko.
Division?
Won't talk, eh? Next.
- Name.
- Ivan Petrov.
Division?
Won't talk. Next.
- Name.
- Ivorich Chernovy.
Division?
These birds are a gabby lot.
Next!
Name.
Division.
Next.
Your name?
Won't even give your name, eh?
Division?
All right, sir, as you like.
Bring in the next batch.
Come on, step up.
- Name?
- Hassan Martinko.
Division?
- Name?
- Nikolai Abramov.
Take a look at this.
Division!
Next!
Name, please.
Name!
Well, that looks like a catch.
May I question that officer who refused to give his name?
Certainly. Will you come back here,
Colonel?
You don't remember me, do you?
I've never seen you before.
You have a very faulty memory for a spy.
- You're mistaken.
- How do you explain this, Colonel?
Well, this does resemble me, doesn't it?
When were you on Austrian territory last?
The Russian Army has been on Austrian territory ever since the war started.
Let me have your fingerprints.
This will be your last visit to this country, Colonel.
- Arrange a court martial.
- I will, Your Excellency.
Take charge of the case, Major.
Send in the next batch.
- Will you come with me?
- Yes, sir. With pleasure.
- Name?
- Ivan Turgenev.
- Division?
- Ivan Petrov.
Next?
- Name?
- I don't smoke.
Don't you think that before shooting a spy, we should make him talk?
- You can't make Russians talk.
- I think I can.
I'll give you ten minutes.
Be careful. He's a dangerous character.
- I'll be careful.
- Turn the prisoner over to her, Lieutenant.
Wire headquarters at once, Colonel, and inform them of the capture of H-14, of the Russian Secret Service, and that we are planning to execute him, possibly tonight.
- Will you please wait outside?
- I wouldn't take any chances with this man.
- I'll take responsibility for that. Wait outside.
- As you wish.
You still don't seem to remember me.
It may be good for you that I don't choose to remember you.
Oh, I don't know.
- This gun is loaded.
- What is it you want?
I have ten minutes in which to make you talk.
You're wasting your time and mine.
What would you rather do than talk?
If you don't mind,
I'd rather be up in the air, flying.
Well, my old friend.
He did bring you good luck, after all.
Perhaps.
Come here.
Watch me, and I'll show you how to play with a gun.
I've an even chance now.
I don't know whether I can get away, but there seem to be plenty of planes outside.
If it weren't going to be more exciting out there, I'd be tempted to stay with you.
Hope you're on my side, next war!
Before the sentence, have you anything to say?
No, I have nothing to say.
As a matter of record, tell me why a woman charged with important work should permit or aid the escape of a dangerous enemy, why she should dishonor the service, violate duty because of a casual affection for that man.
Perhaps I loved him.
You can't make me believe you can love a man you've known for a few hours.
That sort of love can be bought on the streets.
I found her on the streets.
You had a chance to redeem your unfortunate life in the service of your country.
Can you give one reason you failed to take advantage of that privilege?
I suppose I'm not much good, that's all.
Will you please stand up?
You have left us no choice in your case.
The crime is treason and the penalty is death.
You will be executed tomorrow morning at dawn.
And may God have mercy on your soul.
Can I help you, daughter?
I am going to face this journey, too, alone.
You have no fear of this death?
It's only another exciting adventure.
A perfect end to an imperfect life.
How much more time have I?
About ten hours.
Could you possibly help me to die in a uniform of my own choosing?
What would you call a uniform of your own choosing?
Any dress I wore when I served my countrymen instead of my country.
I will send for your clothes. Anything else?
Yes.
A piano. One that's in tune.
I will see what can be done.
Fall in!
Is it time?
Will you please follow me?
Are we going to walk together again?
Do you happen to have a looking glass?
Will this do?
May I please bandage your eyes?
I will not kill a woman.
I will not kill any more men, either.
Do you call this war?
I call it butchery!
You call this serving your country?
You call this patriotism? I call it murder!

SkyFury
Extra! Extra!
Well, looks like we're in it.
Gee, I wish I could go.
Go where?
-Why, to war.
-Why can't you go?
There you are! I knew you'd take that selfish viewpoint.
Why, I'd go in a minute if it wasn't for my flat feet.
Howdy, young fella, how about joining our outfit?
Oh, tough luck, old-timer. 
Can't use you.
Hey, Jim. There's a couple of good prospects up here.
Be nonchalant.
Here he comes.
Good morning, Captain General.
-Well, how about it?
-How about what?
You know what I mean. How about getting into one of these uniforms?
I'm awfully sorry but we're incapacitated.
Incapacitated?
Yes, sir. There's been a lot of it going round.
Just as I expected.
A couple of crummy, no-good slackers.
Talking like that!
You should be ashamed of yourself!
Ashamed of what?
-Oh. I'm sorry.
-You ought to be.
Oh, come on. 
No hard feelings.
Here. 
Get yourself a cup of coffee.
Thank you.
It's a fine looking outfit you are!
Look at yourselves!
-Attention!
-Oh-ho-ho!
Now listen!
We're going to try this once more and when I say "Halt!"
I mean halt!
And halt means to stop!
Ten-shun!
Squad, right march!
Halt!
-Splendid
-Thank you, sir.
Forward march!
To the right, turn!
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, hup!
One, two, three, four!
Why don't you have us do like that?
Fall in! 
Fall in!
You lunkheads!
I never saw such half-witted mugs in all my life!
Now, you mugs, I'm going to give you one more chance.
And if you don't get it right this time, you're going to get kitchen police from now on!
When he says turn to the right, go that way.
Follow me.
Squad to the left, march!
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, hup!
If you'd done as the sergeant told you, we wouldn't be doing this.
-I knew what to do.
-Well, why didn't you do it?
Well, 
I just couldn't think of it.
-"Couldn't think of it"!
-Hurry up with those cans.
What do we do with this stuff?
Are you trying to kid somebody?
What do you suppose you do with it?
Take it to the General.
What do you suppose the General wants with this?
There you go asking questions again.
Why don't you try doing as you're told once?
You've got to follow the curriculum of the army -with discipline.
Come on. If the General wants it, he can have it.
Pardon me, boys.
Hey, salad department!
-Hello, Eddie.
-Hi. What have you two been up to now?
We've been promoted to the culinary platoon.
-Looks like a swill job.
-Aw.
This won't stop you having dinner with the wife and me Friday?
Oh, not a chance. With good behaviour we'll be through with this job Thursday.
That's great. 
Wait till you see my kid.
And will she go crazy about you two.
Hey, Smitty, somebody wants you in the social hall.
OK, I'll be right there. 
Don't forget -Friday.
OK, Friday.
-He is a great guy, ain't he?
-He certainly is. I like him.
-Are you the General?
-D-oh.
-Is he home?
-Yes. What do you want?
-I got that stuff for him.
-What stuff?
-Rogers?
-Yes, sir?
-Come come.
-You'd better bring it in.
-Morning, sir.
-Morning.
Rogers, do you smell anything?
No, sir. 
I've got a cold in me dose.
-No grapefruit this morning, Rogers.
-No, sir.
What's the meaning of this?!
Rogers! Rogers!
Rogers! This one here too!
Take it out of here! Every bit of it!
Rogers! Rogers!
No! No!
Look who's here! 
Hiya!
Oh, the baby!
Do you love me? Sure you do!
Couldn't the wife come down?
Is there anything I can do?
No. I guess not.
-Poor baby.
-Mm. That's what I'm thinking about.
Poor kid.
It'd be a cinch if I could take her to the folks.
-Can't you?
-No.
We had a fuss when I got married, so that's out.
We'll get along all right, won't we?
I'll be at the house Friday. 
We'll talk then.
Goodbye, honey. 
See you Friday.
Hey, Eddie!
We can't come Friday.
So you told on me, huh?
You did, didn't ya?
OK, you snitches.
Let me tell you something.
Someday I'm gonna catch up with you guys again.
And when I do I'm gonna have my knife.
And when I've got my knife, you better never let me find you in the same state.
Do you get me?!
All right. First squad, outside.
Come on. Up and at 'em, boy.
Go on, get out of there.
Get out of here.
Come on, step on it! Get up!
Will you keep off of me?!
See what that is.
Don't you think it's about time that we had some fresh water?
That isn't water. That's coffee.
Pour it out and get some clean water.
Not there. 
Outside.
Coffee! Hm!
Hey, can't you guys lay off for just a little while?
-What's wrong with him?
-I don't know.
Since he got a letter about the baby he hasn't been the same.
Trouble?
Something happened to the old woman.
The kid's with strangers.
Why don't he send her to his folks?
That gives me an idea.
-Come here.
-Where are you going?
No place. 
Come here.
We'll write a letter to his father to go and get the baby.
-How are you gonna get the address?
-We'll use tact.
Come on, Smith. Get up.
You're out on post. Snap out of it!
OK.
-Hi.
-Have a good sleep?
Yeah. Swell.
Say, Eddie, where's the baby living now?
What do you wanna know for?
Well, it's getting close to Christmas... we thought maybe we'd like to send a little Christmas present.
Ah, gee. That's darn nice of you guys.
-How about giving us the address?
-Yeah. You'll need that, won't you?
It's on the back of that.
Copy it off and give it back to me.
Er, Eddie, there's another little item.
Er, what is the address of your father and mother?
What?
Oh. Do you wanna send them a Christmas present too?
-And how!
-Yeah.
I'm way ahead of you and that's out.
OK, buddy. Take your hole.
About time you were getting here.
I knew your idea was all wet!
-Smith.
-Yeah?
OK.
Give 'em hell!
-What's going on?
-Been a raid.
-Did they get anybody, Sergeant?
-Yeah. They got Smith.
They got Eddie.
-Send over a raiding party right away.
-Yes, sir.
Well, who wants to go?
-I'll take a chance, Sarge.
-Never mind.
Congratulations, boys. 
That's the spirit.
Come on, get going. Let's go.
-Come on.
-Bye, Ollie.
Come on, you too. Let's go. 
Get outta here.
And don't come back without a prisoner!
Corporal, get two replacements.
-We'll need 'em.
-Yes, Sergeant.
Quick. Let's get in here.
We'll be out of danger.
Do something! Stop it!
Come on, everyone!
Once upon a time, there was a dear little girl and her name was Cinderella.
And she had... a stepfather and two ugly sisters.
Oh, dear. 
I don't know the rest, so you'll have to go to bed now and I'll tell you it tomorrow.
Miss Annie, is this my daddy?
Yes, that's your daddy.
When is he coming home?
How should I know?
Now stay in the other room and don't bother me. Run along now.
Mr Jack?
Mr Jack? Where did my daddy...?
Where did my daddy go?
Get outta here. Go on.
Annie!
Annie! Will you get this brat out of here so I can sleep?
So you can sleep?
-Too tired to watch her for a minute!
-Shut up!
-No, I won't shut up!
-Shut up!
If it wasn't for the money you get for that kid, you'd starve!
-So you're starting it again, are ya?
-Yes and I'm not finishing.
-I do everything around here.
-I'm gonna finish it this time for you!
Get in that kitchen, go on!
Oh, Daddy! Why don't you come and take me away from here?
Come here. 
Come outta there.
-Please don't...
-You're to blame for all this.
Come in.
-Good morning.
-What do you want?
-Is that Eddie Smith's baby?
-Yeah. What of it?
Oh, come here. 
My goodness.
Just like Eddie.
Hey! What's the big idea?
-We've come to take her away.
-Yeah? Who are you?
Why, I'm Mr Hardy and this is my friend, Mr Laurel.
Who gave you the authority to take her?
-We are friends of her father.
-Yeah? Well, I don't know you two mugs.
And you ain't gonna take the kid outta the house. See?
-What are you gonna do about it?
-What am I gonna do?
Yeah.
Do that again.
Sit there, honey.
Hike.
Hey, Jerry! Two guys beating it with the kid. Get 'em!
-What's the matter, Jack?
-Give those two monkeys the works.
Sure.
Do something to help me here!
Hey, get the baby and let's beat it!
Now what are we going to do?
-Find Mr Smith.
-You don't know where he lives.
Leave that to me. It's the simplest thing in the world.
Come on. Come on.
Pardon me, Officer. Could you tell us where Mr Smith lives?
-Smith?
-Yes.
Smith. Let me think.
-What Smith?
-It's Eddie's father.
-Eddie who?
-The father of this child.
Yes. What's his name?
-Who?
-Why, the father of this child.
-That's who you're looking for.
-Oh, no, sir.
The man we're looking for is the father of the father of this child.
Oh, now I understand you.
-The grandfather is lost.
-Yes, sir... No, sir.
-He's not lost.
-No?
-So why are you looking for him?
-We're not, we're just trying to find him.
-He doesn't know about the baby.
-He doesn't?
-We were in France together...
-Yes. Wait just a minute, boys.
Relax, would you, please? Relax.
Come here, darling.
Now, sweetheart. Can you tell me who these gentlemen are looking for?
-Mr Smith.
-Mr Smith? Well, isn't that fine?
-Now, honey. Where does he live?
-Who?
If you boys get a city directory, you'll save yourself a lot of trouble.
Come on.
Why did you stop him in the first place?
-Is this the place?
Is Mr Smith home?
I'm Mr Smith.
Are you Eddie's father?
Eddie who?
We won't go into that.
We've made a little mistake.
-Oh, that's all right. That's all right.
-All right.
Come, sweetheart.
-Is Mr Smith in?
-Yeah.
-Hey, Steamboat. Someone to see you.
-OK.
-Are you Mr Smith?
-Yeah. What of it?
This is your son's baby.
-My son's baby?
-Yes, sir.
Blackmailers, eh?
What's the next address?
311 Chester Drive.
Come on.
What a handsome bridegroom!
Put it in its proper place.
I can't help it, Papa. 
I feel all kinda funny.
How's the bridegroom holding up?
A little weak but we'll get him there.
Eddie, I'm very proud to welcome you into my family and I know that you and my daughter are going to be very happy.
Thank you, Mr Hathaway.
-The bride is ready, sir.
-All right. Shall we go?
Yes. Now don't be nervous, my boy.
Go ahead.
Telegram for Mr Smith.
Smith? Smith hasn't lived here in four years.
-Where's he moved to?
-I haven't the least idea.
-Is this 311 Chester Drive?
-Yes.
-Thank you, sir.
-You're welcome.
Wait a minute. I'll do this.
You've gotten us into enough trouble.
-What do you want?
-Can we see the master of the house?
He's very busy and can't see you.
He'll see us.
Tell him we've got Eddie's baby.
Yes, sir.
-Eddie's baby?
-Yes, sir.
Don't go away. Please wait just a moment. Just a moment.
-We are gathered...
-Pardon me.
-Pardon me. Pardon me!
-We are gathered...
-What's this?
-Are you the master of the house?
-I am.
-We brought you Eddie's baby.
-Eddie's baby?
-Yes, sir.
This is unbelievable!
I knew you'd be surprised.
-Eddie didn't want us to bring her.
-He wouldn't!
Come with me, my dear. 
Come with me.
Don't go away. 
Don't go away!
-Get out of my way!
-Yes, sir.
Stop!
What's the meaning of this?
You don't know, huh?! Well, that monkey is the father of this child!
-Well, fan my brow!
-I'll fan your...!
-The wedding is off!
-Now look here...
I didn't want to say anything but I knew it all the time.
I've never been so mad in all my life!
-I think this is a frame-up!
-A frame-up, eh?
Just a minute.
-Who says that I'm the father?
-Who says so?
Oh, playing the innocent, are you?
Parkins, bring those two men in here.
Yes, sir. 
Yes, sir!
Yes, sir!
Will you come right in, sir?
Come right in, please.
Here they are, sir.
Is this or is this not Eddie's baby?
-It certainly is.
-Deny that if you can!
-It's a lie!
-You blackguard!
You bluebeard!
Now, Father, it's a frame-up!
It's not possible!
Oh. How could I ever thank you?
You have saved the family's name.
Oh, Pop! 
No, Pop!
No, Pop! Let me explain!
Wait a minute, Pop!
What's the trouble, Mr Smith?
Why those people are... 
Smith?!
Yes, sir.
-Did you call me Mr Smith?
-Yes, sir.
Parkins... my Winchester.
-Yes, sir.
-My name is not Smith.
It's Hathaway.
I'm afraid we've made a little faux pas.
I'm afraid that you have!
-I'm sorry for any inconvenience.
-Quite all right.
The next address is 
49 Colebrook Avenue.
It's just around...
From now on, we'll telephone. 
Come on!
I'm awfully sorry.
What's the matter, Uncle Ollie?
I must have called up 
10,000 Smiths.
Where is Uncle Stan?
Uncle Stan left town early this morning.
-What for?
-He's going to find your grandparents.
I hope he doesn't find them.
You go ahead and play because
Uncle Ollie's got a lot of work to do.
Uncle Ollie.
You went boom!
Uncle Stan! 
I've been waiting for you!
-Any luck?
-Not a bit.
-Where'd you go?
-Eh?
-Where'd you go?
-All the way to Poughkeepsie.
And that ain't them.
You mean to tell me you went all the way down there to see these two?
I thought it might be them.
Wasting your time like that while I'm here slaving all day.
Why don't you do something to help me?
-What can I do?
-You can take care of the baby.
I've got my ironing to do.
The Smith Brothers. Oh!
I've got a new bedtime story to tell you.
All right.
Once upon a time, there was a little girl and her name was Goldilocks.
And she lived at home with her mummy and her daddy.
And she went way out in the woods.
And... she went to the field where the three bears lived.
And she...
When she went to the three bears' house, she saw three bowls of porridge on the table.
And she tried them all but only the baby bear's...
Only the baby bear's porridge was good and she ate it all up.
Well, then she saw some chairs and she tried all the chairs but only the baby bear's chair was comfortable.
So she sat right down and it broke.
And...
Then...
She went upstairs.
And she saw three beds.
And she tried all the beds but only the baby bear's bed was comfy.
So she went fast asleep.
And then she...
Presently the three bears came home.
And the father bear said,
"Who's been sitting eating my porridge, I should like to know?"
The mother bear said, "Who's been tasting my porridge, I should like to know?"
Then the baby bear said, "Who's been eating my porridge and eaten it all up?"
And then they went to sit down.
The father bear said, "Who's been sitting in my chair, I should like to know?"
The mother bear said, "Who's been sitting in my chair, I should like to know?"
And the baby bear said, "Who's been sitting in my chair, I should like to know?"
And...
And... And then...
Get up and put that baby to bed.
What are you trying to do?
They still have the child in their possession?
Yeah.
They run that lunch wagon at the corner of Second Avenue and 16th Street.
Thank you for the information.
I'll take care of it immediately.
Scat! Scat!
-Give me a cigar.
-Yes, sir. Nice cigar.
There you are, sir.

-Hi!
-Well, well, well, well!
She said just let me come and see her uncles before we went for a walk.
-Take care of her, Mrs MacTavish.
-Don't you worry.
I'll take care of her as though she were my own lassie.
-Have a nice time.
-Wait. I've got something for you.
Guess which hand it's in and I'll give it to you.
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.
-Bye, Uncle Stan.
-Goodbye!
-Bye!
-Bye, Uncle Ollie!
-Goodbye!
-Bye!
Bye, darling!
Good morning, sir.
-I want some information.
-We have hamburgers, frankfurters...
No. That is not the information that I desire.
It has come to my attention that you have a child to which you have no legal right.
What's it to you?
As an officer in the East Side
Welfare Association,
I intend to place that child in an orphanage where she belongs.
Over our dead body you'll put her in an orphanage.
You mean you refuse to give her up?
We certainly do. Mm.
Very well. I'll swear out a warrant for your arrest.
I'll have that child in the orphanage tonight.
How much will you charge me to haunt a house?
-He can't do that, can he?
-You heard what he said.
Let's move to another street so they can't find us.
Another street?!
We've got to get to another state!
I wish we hadn't bought the wagon.
-Drive to the First National Bank.
-What for?
-We'll refinance our business.
-What about the wagon?
Drive me to the bank and don't ask any more questions!
I'll pack up on the way.
And listen -don't hit anything.
Get me some cigars. 
Let's do this right.
Fix your tie. 
You look terrible.
Come on.
-Good morning.
-Good morning.
-Thank you.
-Are you the president?
-No. What is your business?
-Our business is with the president.
-Have you an appointment?
-No.
-I'm sorry, but you can't see him.
-What do you mean?
-You can't see him.
-We can if we want...
I'll take care of this. 
You can't talk to us...
-I said you can't see the president.
-Just a minute, Saunders.
Don't you think you're exceeding your authority?
My office is open to the public at all times.
Gentlemen, step this way, please.
Come right in, gentlemen.
-Have a cigar.
-Thank you.
-Won't you sit down?
-Thank you.
Pardon me. 
Just a slight mistake.
-Have a cigar.
-That's quite all right.
Now, to get on to business.
-Yes, er...?
-Pardon me just a moment.
Give me another weenie.
Now, gentlemen, what can I do for you?
Why, we'd like to negotiate a little loan.
Hm. Have you any collateral?
I'm sorry. 
We haven't any collateral.
We figure to put up our business as security.
-What is your business?
-Restaurants.
-Here in town?
-Oh, all over town.
Here, there and... thither.
-Chain business.
-No. Restaurant.
You'll have to pardon my friend.
He's not familiar with big business deals.
That's quite all right.
What is the name of your firm?
"Laurel and Hardy, caterers to the elite. "
How much do you require?
I think a couple of thousand dollars would tide us over.
I don't think we'll have any difficulty about this, gentlemen.
If you'll give me a little time on it,
I'll have our appraiser drop in and see you tomorrow.
-We can't wait till tomorrow.
-I know.
And is that part of your business?
Part of it? 
That's all of it.
-All of it?
-Yes, sir.
Now that's settled, could we have the money right away?
To lend you $2,000 on a business like that,
I'd have to be unconscious!
Look, he's unconscious.
It's a good thing you stopped.
I've been chasing you for three blocks.
Here. 
You dropped this up there.
-What's the matter with him?
-The sudden shock. This is his life savings.
-Put it in the bank.
-Yes, sir. We will.
Thank you very much. 
Goodbye, sir.
-What's the matter?
-I heard your house is on fire.
You better get there quick!
-What house?
-I told her that to get rid of her.
Get packed. We've got to get out of here.
Come on, sweetheart. 
You stay right there.
Oh, I've gotta hide! Ooh!
Lie there. 
Stay covered and don't move.
-What are you trying to do?
-I got locked in.
Why didn't you tell me it was you?
It was so dark, I didn't think you'd hear. I was scared!
Get that trunk packed. 
They're coming.
Can you tell me where the two men live who run that lunch counter?
Yeah. Over there in the brownstone. Upstairs.
-Oh! Quick!
-What's the matter?
Look! They're coming.
We've got to get her out of here. 
Take her.
-Let's hide her up the chimney.
-We can't do that.
We've got to hide her somewhere...
Get out of there.
I have it. Put her in the dumb waiter.
I'll get things cleaned up.
Be nonchalant.
Not here. Somewhere else.
Come in.
Good afternoon.
Getting ready to leave, eh?
I guess we're just in time.
-Where's that baby?
-What baby?
Search the place. Get off.
Come on, get out of here.
Come out of there.
That's no place for you to play in.
Go and sit over there.
Try the kitchen. 
Watch that door.
Get away!
Well, I guess the game is up.
I thought you'd come to your senses. Where is she?
-Up on the roof.
-Get that ladder.
-I didn't put her up on the roof...
-Shut up!
Open that door!
Quick, go down in the dumb waiter.
Send it back for me.
Open in the name of the law!
Hurry and send it up.
Open the door in the name of the law!
Hurry!
Oh, hurry! Hey, hey, hey! 
Send it up!
Quick! 
Downstairs!
Quick, let's hide.
Here.
-Did you see them?
-They didn't come out here.
Watch the side entrance.
We'll search the basement.
Search that coal vent.
Get outta here! 
Come on!
Here they are. 
Now, don't get excited, dear.
Is this the pair, sir?
Yes. That's them.
Did you get the money?
Here you are, sir.
-Come on, you two. Get going!
-Wait a minute.
-Is this boy with you Eddie Smith?
-Sure.
-Mother?
-Yes, dear?
Look here.
-My boy!
-Yes.
-Are you Eddie's father?
-Yes.
Well, can you beat that?
We've been looking for you for months.
-You have?
-That's Eddie's baby.
What?! Why...
Oh dear...
Eddie's baby. Oh, darling!
Oh, Officer. 
Release these gentlemen.
-Dinner is served, sir.
-Arrange for three more, Meadows.
Very good, sir.
We had a lot of trouble finding you, Mr Smith.
Well, boys, you can pack up your troubles from now on!
Isn't that great? 
No more troubles.
No more...
What-Whatever's the matter, 
Pierre?
Listen. If you want company for dinner, you can cook it yourself.
Why...?
Well, if it ain't the snitchers.
And I've got my knife!

And the faces of the men who work that earth are hard and dry from the sun.
This worthless land with water will yield much.
For fifty years we wanted to irrigate but they held us back.
Now we will bring water to it to raise food for the defenders of Madrid.
The village of Fuentedueña, where fifteen hundred people live and work the land for the common good.
It is good bread stamped with the Union label.
But there is only enough for the village.
Irrigating the waste land of the village can give ten times as much grain for bread, as well as potatoes, wine and onions for Madrid.
The village is on the Tajo river and the main highroad that is the life line between Valencia and Madrid.
All food for Madrid comes on this road.
To win the war the rebel troops must cut this road.
They plan the irrigation of the dry fields.
They go to trace the ditch.
This is the true face of men going into action.
It is a little different from any other face that you will ever see.
Men cannot act before the camera in the presence of death.
The villagers in Fuentedueña hear this noise and say...
"our guns".
The frontline curves north to Madrid.
These were the doors of houses that are empty now.
Those who survived the bombardment bring them to reinforce the new trenches.
When you are fighting to defend your country, war, as it lasts, becomes an almost-normal life.
You eat, and drink, and sleep, and read the papers.
The loudspeaker of the People's Army.
It has a range of two kilometers.
When these men started for the lines three months ago, many of them held a rifle for the first time.
Some did not even know how to reload.
Now they are instructing the new recruits how to take down and reassemble a rifle.
This is the salient driven into Madrid itself when the enemy took the University City.
After repeated counter-attacks they are still in the "Casa de Velázquez", the palace on the left with the pointed towers, and in the ruined Clinical Hospital.
The bearded man is
Commander Martínez de Aragón.
Before the war he was a lawyer.
He was a brave and skillful commander, and he died in the attack on the "Casa del Campo" on the day we filmed the battle there.
The rebels try to relieve the Clinic.
Julián, a boy from the village, writes home:
"Papa, I will be there in three days.
Tell our mother".
The troops are called together.
The company is assembled to elect representatives to attend the big meeting for celebrating the union of all the militia regiments into the new brigades of the People's Army.
Enrique "Lister", a stonemason from Galicia.
In six months of fighting he rose from a simple soldier to the command of a division.
He's one of the most brilliant young soldiers of the Republican Army.
Carlos, one of the first commanders of the Fifth Regiment.
He talks of the Army of the People.
How they are fighting for Spanish democracy and for the Government they themselves have chosen.
Fighting together we shall win a new strong Spain.
José Díaz, he used to work twelve hours a day as a typesetter before he became a member of the Spanish Parliament.
Gustav Regler, one of the fine writers of Germany, who came to Spain to fight for his ideals.
He was gravely wounded in June.
Regler praises the unity of the People's Army.
The defense of Madrid will remind men always of their loyalty and courage.
The most famous woman in Spain today is speaking.
They call her "La Pasionaria".
She is not a romantic beauty, nor any Carmen.
She's the wife of a poor miner of Asturias.
But all the character of the new Spanish woman is in the voice.
"Comrades of the 12th Flag,"
"José Leiva speaking. Do you know me?
I'm among my brothers of The People's Army..."
"...where I've been given an excellent treatment".
"Here you can't see the beastly
treatment we are given in those lines".
Living in the cellars of that ruined building are the enemy.
They are Moors and Civil Guards.
They are brave troops or they would not have held out after their position is hopeless.
But they are professional soldiers fighting against the people in arms, trying to impose the will of the military on the will of the people, and the people hate them, for without their tenacity and the constant aid of Italy and Germany, the Spanish revolt would have ended six weeks after it began.
This battalion goes on leave, and Julián, who is with them, has three days leave to the village.
The Duke of Alba's Palace is destroyed by rebel bombardment.
Treasures of Spanish art are carefully salvaged by government militiamen.
Madrid, by its position, is a natural fortress, and each day the people make its defences more impregnable.
You stand in line all day to buy food for supper.
Sometimes the food runs out before you reach the door.
Sometimes a shell falls near the line and at home they wait and wait, and no one brings back anything for supper.
Unable to enter the town, the enemy try to destroy it.
This is a man who had nothing to do with war.
A book-keeper on his way to his office at eight o'clock in the morning.
So now they take the book-keeper away.
But not to his office or to his home.
The Government urges all civilians to evacuate Madrid.
But "where will we go?"
"Where can we live?"
"What can we do for a living?"
"I won't go. I'm too old".
But we must keep the children off the street, except when there is need to stand in line.
Recruiting is speeded up by the bombardment.
Every useless killing angers the people.
Men from all businesses, professions and trades enlist in the Republican Army.
Meanwhile, in Valencia, the President...
Julián catches a ride on an empty truck and comes home sooner than he expected.
Julián drills the village boys in the evening, when they come back from the fields.
In Madrid, a future shock battalion of bullfighters, football players and athletes is drilling.
They say the old goodbyes that sound the same in any language.
She says she'll wait.
He says that he'll come back.
He knows she'll wait. Who knows for what the way the shelling is.
Nobody knows if he comes back.
"Take care of the kid", he says.
"I will", she says and knows she can't.
They both know that when they move you out in trucks, it's to a battle.
Death comes each morning to these people of the town, sent from the hills two miles away.
The smell of death is acrid high-explosive smoke and blasted granite.
Why do they stay?
They stay because this is their city.
These are their homes. Here is their work. This is their fight.
The fight to be allowed to live as human beings.
Boys look for bits of shell fragment as they once gathered hill stones.
So the next shell finds them.
The German artillery has increased their allowance for battery today.
Before, death came when you were old or sick, but now it comes to all this village.
High in the sky and shining silver it comes to all who have no place to run, no place to hide.
Three "Junkers" planes did this.
The Government pursuit-planes shot one "Junkers" down.
I can't read German either.
These dead came from another country.
They signed to work in Ethiopia, the prisoners said.
We took no statements from the dead but all the letters we read were very sad.
The Italians lost more killed, wounded and missing in this single battle of Brihuega than in all the Ethiopian war.
The rebels attack the Madrid-Valencia road again.
They've crossed the Jarama river and try to take the Arganda bridge.
Troops are rushed from the North to the counter-attack.
The village works to bring the water.
They arrive at the Valencia road.
The infantry in the assault, where cameras need much luck to go.
The slow, heavy-laden, undramatic movement forward.
The men in echelon, in columns of six.
In the ultimate loneliness of what is known as contact, where each man knows there is only himself and five other men, and before them all the great unknown.
This is the moment that all the rest of war prepares for, when six men go forward into death to walk across a stretch of land and by their presence on it prove
"THIS EARTH IS OURS".
The counter-attack has been successful.
The road is free.
Six men were five.
Then four were three.
But these three stayed, dug in and held the ground, along with all the other fours and threes and twos that started out as sixes.
The bridge is ours,... the road is saved.
The men who never fought before, who were not trained in arms, who only wanted work and food, fight on...

Prince Alexander Nevsky, son of Yaroslav - N. Cherkasov
Vasily Buslai - N. Okhlopkov
Gavrilo Olexich - A. Abrikosov
Master of the Teuton Order -
V. Ershov
The 13th century.
Knights of the Teuton Order invaded Russia from the West.
Russia's vast and rich lands beckoned an invader.
The German aggressors expected an easy victory over our people:
Russia was still recovering from the Mongol bloodbath.
The countryside was sown with the debris of bloody battles.
- The Pleshcheevo Lake -
There was a battle on the Neva River.
A battle on the wide Neva.
There we fought a vast and vicious enemy.
A cruel adversary, the Swedish host.
The bloody battle raged on.
We broke their ships into matchsticks.
We spilled our blood like water.
All for the sake of our land, the great Mother Russia...
To your knees!
Who are you?
Who were you looking for?
Why are you hitting him?
What's all that shouting?
You are scaring the fish!
Halt!
Don't you start fighting!
A guest who enters a house does not strike its owners.
Who are you?
The Prince of this land,
Alexander.
Is that you they call
''Nevsky''?
Yes.
Are you the one who defeated the Swedes?
So what are you doing here?
Fishing.
Couldn't you find anything better to do?
What's wrong with fishing?
We shall build a fleet and sail to trade overseas. Right?
Come to us, to the Golden Horde.
We will make you a general.
We need warlords.
We have a saying:
''Lt's better to die than to leave your homeland.''
The Russian lands we shall never surrender.
Whoever rises against Russia, will be smitten.
Russia had risen on the enemy at the Novgorod field of glory.
The Mongols are a hard-necked people, a strong people.
It won't be easy fighting them.
Is there a will for the fight?
It is time to avenge the deaths of our forefathers...
The Mongols can wait a while.
We have a more dangerous enemy.
An enemy who is closer and more cruel.
An enemy we could not buy our souls from with ransom:
The Germans.
After we beat them, we shall take care of the Mongols.
Let it be the Germans, then.
You know better where to start but our patience is at its end, Prince!
The Germans cannot be beaten without aid from Novgorod.
The campaign against them must start at Novgorod.
Novgorod is the last stronghold of the Free Russia.
The fish are escaping!
- The Free City of Novgorod -
Vasily Buslai! Gavrilo Olexich!
Come to your old friend.
I have Indian armor,
Tartar spears.
- Sharp Saracen swords.
- Stop lying.
You must have forged them yourself overnight.
Every bird subsists by its own beak.
We are fed up with wars, we are busy with other matters.
The young bulls are frolicking, smelling the spring in the air.
We've won glory in battle, now it's time to think of ourselves.
Have you heard? Vasily is going to get married.
When the she-goat is in the yard, the billy peeks in.
I am tired of spilling blood.
I fight one day, then brood for two.
I wanted to go to the Volga, play about with my battle-axe.
- But the brooding won me over.
- Go be a monk, then.
I am thinking about matters of the heart.
If my wishes are not met,
I may well go to the monastery.
Like a bear, to slaughter calfs on the altar.
Olga Danilovna, allow me to send matchmakers to your father.
- No, I'll be the one to do it.
- Let her give us the sign.
She will tell us whom her heart will choose.
Tell us, Olga Danilovna, which one of us shall be your groom?
Forgive me, good people, I fail to understand your meaning.
What do you mean?
Don't pull the bull by its tail!
Tell us who you will marry.
Choose one of us.
If you want a merry and handsome lad, give me a sign.
If you prefer a more settled and boring type, choose Gavrilo.
If you are looking for lumps, choose Buslai.
If you wish to be a mistress in your home, I'm your partner.
I do not know what to say to you.
Both of you are good.
In time I shall give you my answer.
Brothers! People of Novgorod!
The Germans have taken Pskov and are advancing toward you!
They are slaughtering everyone who dared to take up arms!
One who is caught with a sword, is killed for the sword!
One who is caught with a loaf of bread, is killed for the bread!
Mothers and wives are tortured for their sons and husbands!
The Germans are like wild beasts!
We know them well!
One who raises his voice to scream, is killed for the scream.
One who is silent, is killed for the silence.
They have divided Russia among the German warlords.
One was awarded Pskov, another
- Novgorod!
Leave your trade, good people of Novgorod!
Wait! What is this senseless commotion?
Don't confuse these folks! We have a treaty with the Germans.
What is Pskov to us? If need be, we'll ransom ourselves!
We have surplus of goods, lying around needlessly.
The waterfronts are piled high with goods. The stores are full.
Will you trade Russia for your goods?
What's with you? What Russia?
Where have you seen it last?
It's every man for himself.
Wherever you make your bed, there's your homeland.
You lying dog!
A snake is known by its hiss.
Don't you feed me what I can't swallow!
A mother or a stepmother, it's all the same to the rich!
Where they make a profit, there is their motherland.
To us, the simple folk, the
Germans bring certain death.
We must invite Prince Alexander and strike at the Germans!
- Alexander? Never!
- We don't want Alexander!
- We don't want him!
- Summon Alexander!
Let's not wait for Alexander.
We shall gather a host and strike at the
Germans ourselves!
Domash the son of Tverdislav will lead us into battle.
He has seen harder battles than this. Lead us, Domash!
- Domash for general!
- Lead us into battle, Domash!
We are beset by a great misfortune.
A great trouble requires a great man.
Not I, another leader is needed here.
A man whose arm is stronger and mind is clearer than mine whose glory has spread through the land and reached the enemy!
Who is that man, brothers?
Prince Alexander, son of Yaroslav!
We must invite Alexander and call Russia to arms.
Otherwise the Germans will decimate the Russian people.
We will be squeezed between the Germans and the Mongols and then we'll know what trouble means!
Call for Alexander!
- City of Pskov -
Great Master!
Pskov is at your feet.
That's not the way to make cities surrender.
If you give me Novgorod in this state.
I shall hang you on the nearest tree.
Great Master! Order your men to gather ropes!
Ropes? Why?
To tether the rebels at Novgorod!
They brazenly decided to resist and invited Prince Alexander.
That was the man who defeated the Swedes on the Neva.
A man capable of defeating us has not yet been born.
As to princes, I have enough of my own.
The brave knight Hubertus.
As Lord of all the conquered Russian lands
I dub you the Prince of Pskov.
The glorious knight Dietlieb.
You shall be the
Prince of Novgorod.
Hurry to Novgorod, Ananias.
You must incite the residents against Prince Alexander.
There is only one Lord, who is in heaven and his pontiff on Earth is but one.
There is only one sun to light the whole universe and lend its light to the planets and stars.
Holy Rome alone shall rule the world.
Whoever does not bow to Rome shall be put to death!
Well, do you agree?
It won't be your way, Tverdilo.
Russia won't bow to the Germans.
We have beaten you in the past, we shall beat you yet again!
- All in good time!
- Hang the foul-mouth!
Father!
Let me come with you, father!
Go away, Vasilisa!
Remember our blood!
Avenge us!
Wipe them off of the face of the Earth!
Go to Peryaslavl.
Call Alexander!
Devastated Pskov is crying out for you, Alexander!
- Peryalslavl -
Instead of mending nets we should be fighting the Germans.
Go to sleep!
It's delicate work, not like hitting the Swedes.
Prince! People from Novgorod are asking to see you!
From Novgorod? Bring me my ceremonial dress.
Let them in.
Greetings from the
Great City of Novgorod!
We have come to call you to our aid.
Why? Have you quarrelled among yourselves and have no one to separate you?
The enemy is near, Prince lzborsk has fallen.
Pskov taken.
Pskov?
The Germans are advancing toward Novgorod.
Is Great Novgorod trembling with fear?
Have pity on the orphans, Prince.
Forget the affront,
Alexander.
Rise for Novgorod!
I shall rise to avenge the suffering of Russia.
No truer words have ever been spoken. Rise to her defence!
Defence? I do not know how to defend.
We shall smite them with all our power!
Your warriors are not inferior to the Germans, Prince.
My bodyguard alone is not enough.
We shall call the peasants to arms.
With their help we shall surely defeat the enemy by spring.
Arise, you Russian people!
In a just battle to the death!
Arise, people free and brave!
Rise to defend our fair land!
Our warriors will have honors, our fallen - eternal glory.
For the homes of our fathers, arise, you Russian people!
Arise, you Russian people!
In a just battle to the death!
Arise, people free and brave!
Rise to defend our fair land!
Our warriors will have honors, our fallen - eternal glory.
For the homes of our fathers, arise, you Russian people!
Arise, you Russian people!
In a just battle to the death!
Arise, people free and brave!
Rise to defend our fair land!
We shall not give up Russia, our enemies will be smitten!
Russia has risen against the foe, to fight for Novgorod!
- Novgorod -
We don't want war!
Go back to Peryaslavl!
We don't have any love for you!
You don't have to love me. I have not come to you as a lover.
I came to lead you into battle, Novgorod the Free.
If you don't fight willingly, my lords, the peasants will break your bones!
The Mongols hold Russia from the banks of the Volga to Novgorod.
The Germans are advancing from the West.
Russia is lying between the mallet and the anvil.
You stand alone,
Novgorod the Fair!
Arise for the sake of our motherland, of our people.
Arise for the cities of Russia, for Kiev, Vladimir and Ryazan!
Arise for the sake of our fields, forests and rivers for the sake of our great people!
Lead the armed hosts of Novgorod, Prince!
Lead the armies of Novgorod!
Lead on! Lead on!
Arise, you Russian people!
In a just battle to the death!
Arise, people free and brave!
Rise to defend our fair land!
No foe will tread over Russia, no foreign army will plunder it.
No enemy will find its routes or trample its fields!
Arise, you Russian people!
In a just battle to the death!
Arise, people free and brave!
Rise to defend our fair land!
The spear-forgers donate a thousand spears!
We shall make five hundred shields!
A thousand!
- We give five hundred axes!
- A thousand!
We pledge our lives!
Lead on, Prince Alexander!
Arise, you Russian people!
In a just battle to the death!
Arise, people free and brave!
Rise to defend our fair land!
Take everything!
I'm giving it all away!
If you have no weapon, take one!
Bring death to the enemy!
Arise, you Russian people!
In a just battle to the death!
Even a small bird has a heart.
What say you? There is no more time to wait.
Tomorrow we do battle.
Why keep us waiting?
Speak plainly!
Fate itself will decide for me.
The braver of the two will send his matchmakers to me...
Without proper tools you can't even kill a flea.
Arise, you Russian people!
In a just battle to the death!
Arise, people free and brave!
Rise to defend our fair land!
No foreign make, this.
Forged with my own two hands.
Too bad, the mail is a bit too short.
Arise, you Russian people!
In a just battle to the death!
Arise, people free and brave!
Rise to defend our fair land!
My brothers, you knights! King
Alexander has dared to resist us but God's hand has punished his impertinence.
His advance guard is trapped in the forest, like a bear.
I invite you all to hunt the Russian bear.
Lead them on their way.
The rabbit skips into a ravine, but the fox follows him.
The rabbit runs into the woods, but the fox stays on his tail.
So the rabbit jumps between two birch trees.
The fox comes after him and gets stuck!
It's twisting and turning, but can't get free. What a calamity!
The rabbit looks at her severely and says:
''Now I will violate your chastity''
''No, neighbor, don't put me to such shame! ''
''Have pity! '' cries the fox.
''I have no time for pity.''
Says the rabbit, and violates her!
Got her stuck between the trees, did he?
Yes, he did.
- And violated her?
- He did!
Run for your life, Prince!
Save your army!
The Germans are coming like a tidal wave!
Domash has fallen.
Buslai taken prisoner.
Buslai, a prisoner?
You lying dog!
Buslai would never surrender!
You slanderous swine!
Prepare to rescue them!
- Chudskoye Lake -
- Why are you slipping?
- There is ice under the horses.
We shall stop his horsemen right here, at Raven's Rock.
The ice is thin, Alexander.
It might break under us.
The Germans' armor is heavier. If they break the ice, all the better.
To the shore!
Retreat back to the shore!
Where are you going?
To the shore!
What's your hurry, Vasya?
Isn't there enough space here for you to stand and fight?
These parts are foreign to us and covered with darkness.
It will be easier to fight on our side.
Withdraw your forces from the lake, Prince.
Hurry, Prince, he's talking sense.
We shall return to our side of the lake before sunrise.
It will be easier to fight standing on our own soil.
Every stone there is a friend, every ravine
- a brother.
One who won't fight on enemy soil has no need of his own!
We shall fight on foreign soil. Understood?
I will not let these dogs tread on the soil of Russia!
Peace be with you, Domash...
We shall fight on the lake!
Here, at Raven's Rock, we shall place the main force.
You, Gavrilo, will command the left flank.
I will take the right with my bodyguard.
And will take the assault force, as well.
You, Mikula, have your men lie in ambush.
The Germans will attack in a wedge formation.
The main force will sustain the first blow at Raven's Rock.
- Who will lead the main force?
- You will.
You've been running all night.
In the daytime you shall stand and sustain their blow, halt the German wedge and hold fast until we crush them from the flanks.
Understood?
Let's go.
Take care, Vasily, stand fast against the Germans.
Chain the supply sledges together and put them behind you.
That will make it easier to hold the Germans.
Right!
Don't forget the agreement about Olga.
Don't you, either!
What are you standing around for? Form ranks on the lake.
- April 5, 1242 -
The German wedge!
It is time.
When the Germans hit Buslai, let the wedge stick in deep and then we will hit them together from both sides.
Retreat to the supply train!
Should we move the train back?
Quiet! We shall die where we stand!
Take courage, sons of Novgorod!
Hold them in! Don't let the wedge spread out!
The time has come,
Alexander.
For Russia! For Russia!
For Russia!
Forward, peasant folk, now it's our turn to hit the Germans!
This is a sword of such well-tempered steel.
Tempering is not the main thing.
The strength of a sword is measured by the arm that wields it!
With knowledge you can even kill a warlock!
Where is Vasily Buslai? Buslai!
Here is Vasily!
Here I am!
To your health, Vasya!
Now we can't get at them with swords...
Don't be hasty, Saveliy!
Savka!
Your work shows no results, Gavrilo!
Go on, show us what courage is!
The Prince is with us!
Smite the Germans!
Bring the Master to me!
Take him to the supply train.
We have carried the day!
I surrender.
A quail may be small, but it's still a bird.
Too bad, the mail is too short.
Some lie, torn with swords.
Others lie pierced with arrows.
Their red blood pouring out.
Onto the soil of Russia...
Izaslavna!
Anastasia!
Sister!
He who fell for Russia has died a hero's death.
I kiss your sightless eyes and caress your cold forehead.
As to the daring hero who survived the fight
To him I shall be a loyal wife.
And a loving spouse.
Are you alive, Olexich?
I am... Vasya...
I shall choose a husband for his courage in battle.
Can you hear her voice?
She is searching for us.
Hear my voice, my heroes, answer me.
You are alive!
Dear ones!
- Thank God, you are alive!
- Where are the Germans?
There are no more Germans!
No Germans, my dear ones!
They were defeated!
Spread to the four winds or sunk below the ice!
If so, we have won the day.
Glory to the Prince.
Glory to us all.
We have not shed our blood in vain.
Olga Danilovna.
We have fought shoulder to shoulder.
We have stricken the Germans with all our heart and might.
I shall not live.
Olga... is yours.
What's with you? Are you going to die before the wedding?
What's with you?
No, I have not been destined to live.
I shall not take a wife.
You shall live, and your glory will live with you.
Bow down before Gavrilo.
He was the first in battle, your hand in marriage belongs to him.
Come to your feet, Olexich.
- City of Pskov -
With all this commotion nobody thinks about matters of state.
Good citizens of Pskov and
Novgorod! I would strike you, lash you mercilessly, had you talked away the Ice battle!
Russia would never forgive us for the lack of daring.
So shall you remember it and shall pass it on to your kin.
And should you forget it, you become like Judas - traitors in the eyes of all Russia!
I promise: Should trouble come,
I shall call Russia to arms anew and if you stand idly by,
I shall strike you mercilessly as long as I am alive, and after it will be the duty of my sons!
And now let us have a court of justice.
We should free the foot soldiers. What say you?
What shall we do with them?
They were forced to fight.
And what about the noble knights?
We shall ask for ransom!
Exchange them for soap!
What should we do with him?
You, the people, should decide his fate!
No enemy shall tread on Russian soil.
Arise, my people, arise!
Give my judgement, Prince.
Decide the fate of the girl!
I said I shall not choose the better-looking one but the one who was more prominent in battle.
My son Vasily has never been second-best to anyone!
They won't let a man live or die in peace.
Forgive me, mother, for contradicting your words.
I have never gone against your will. Don't slander Gavrilo.
Judging fairly, neither of us deserves to be the groom.
Vasilisa was blessed with the greatest courage of all!
There were none braver than she!
Gavrilo was the next best man.
To this I pledge my honor before the people.
So be it.
You have disgraced your mother!
I wanted to get you married.
So where's the problem?
There will be a wedding yet!
Couldn't you even be the first in battle?
I wasn't the last.
Take for your daughter-in-law the girl in the chain mail.
What a beauty!
I haven't lost yet, mother.
And now...
Let us celebrate!
Hooray!
Let's agree in advance, at home keep your fists to yourself.
Go and tell everyone in the foreign lands that Russia lives.
He who comes to us as a guest, let him come with no reservation.
But he who comes to us with a sword, shall die by the sword.
On this stands Russia, and on this she shall stand forever.
''He who comes to us with a sword
''shall die by the sword.
''On this stands Russia
''and on this she shall stand forever.''
"Now, in Injia's sunny clime,
Where I used to spend my time
"A-servin' of 'Er Majesty, the Queen
"Of all them black-faced crew
"The finest man I knew
"Was our regimental bhisti "
Detail, halt!
What was that all about?
They are pilgrims, sahib, going home to the hills.
They beg to follow us for safety.
Tell them not to fall too far behind.
Detail, walk. March!
Jadoo, the sun is going down.
Expect we'd better bivouac at Elephant Rock, as usual.
Yes, Markham sahib.
I don't like it, Mitchell.
I don't like it. Silence is unhealthy.
No word from Markham in 48 hours.
Blast it, an officer and his patrol don't vanish into thin air.
- Telegraph just got through, sir.
- Good.
What have you got?
Wires apparently down for the last two days.
I thought it was something like that.
Emergency signal, sir.
Why doesn't he go on?
Wire's gone dead, sir.
I don't like this.
Can't have the wires down.
Things start too quickly up there.
Higginbotham.
Find Sgts. MacChesney, Cutter, and Ballantine, and bring them here.
That's a bit difficult, as they're all on leave.
On some mysterious mission, they said.
It'll be a mystery if they come back right side up.
Bring them here at once.
- What do you want?
- Where's Sgt. Ballantine?
- Here.
- Where's Sgt. Cutter?
He's busy.
Buying a map for a buried treasure.
You ought to have your head examined.
- I didn't know the map was a swindle.
- You and your emeralds.
You ought to be put in a padded cell.
If we'd found them emeralds, we could've left the army... and lived like dukes. See?
That's the fellow that sold me the map.
Just a minute.
Let me take care of him, will you?
Take your hands off that man.
I'm waiting for an explanation.
Speak up, MacChesney.
Speak up!
We were swindled, sir.
- We?
- Who swindled you?
We don't want to make any charges until we have further proof.
Further proof?
You practically wrecked a village.
You surely didn't do that,
MacChesney, without proof?
Sir, we had our suspicions.
Suspicions of what?
Come on. I've no time to wheedle the story out of you.
We bought a map.
Go on.
From a private in a certain Scottish regiment, sir.
No, I did it. I bought the map myself, sir.
Now, listen. Don't you try to shield your friends, Cutter.
And it won't do you two any good to hide behind Cutter's generosity.
Out with it. A map of what?
Of Lake Singali, sir.
Yes, sir. And the privilege of diving into it to our heart's content.
Diving for what?
- For emeralds, sir.
- A barge full, sir.
According to the information I bought, it was sunk in the year 241.
I can hardly believe it.
Ballantine, a man of your intelligence...
MacChesney, at your age...
They was the spoils of a maharajah, sir.
Thank you, Cutter. That will be sufficient.
As for you two...
I ought to take away your stripes, not only for insubordination... but for idiocy.
Sheer, childish, soft-brained idiocy.
But fortunately for you,
I need all three of you at Tantrapur.
We're going out on a job, sir?
Of the most vital importance.
You leave for Tantrapur... with a detachment in the morning... to repair the telegraph and keep it open.
Left turn! Left wheel, quick march!
Left wheel! Attention!
Eyes forward!
Party, halt!
Sergeants, dismount!
Cold.
Stale.
I don't mind saying the whole thing fair gives me the creeps.
Creeps or no creeps, we've got to get in touch with the Colonel.
We can't until we get them poles up and this wire strung.
Naik, detail 10 men for guard duty.
The remainder will pile arms and prepare for work.
Halt!
Gunga Din, water.
Gunga Din, bring water!
Bring water!
Whoever's been playing tricks with this village is blinking clever.
I couldn't find a trail or a single footprint leading in or out.
So the village isn't quite deserted, eh?
- Salaam, sahib.
- Who are you? What are you doing?
My name is Pandu Lal.
I'm a miserable seller of trinkets.
Last night a band of dacoits raided this village, looted my shop... and stole off with my poor wife and six children.
The children are looking bonny.
Come on, everybody, in the other room.
Go on, get up. On the double.
Get in there. You heard me!
Quick! That's right. Go on.
That's better.
- What's that?
- Trinkets, sahib.
Only what I could save from my pitiful stock.
- Worth hardly a few annas.
- Go on, open them up.
Who are these playful subjects here?
I don't know, but young Toad Face there seems to be leader.
Get them all out of here.
Come on, get out of here. On your feet.
Hold them there.
Naik, detail eight men for escort duty.
Bring them here on the double.
Listen, you.
What became of Burgess sahib?
- Come on, spit it out.
- He can speak, but he won't.
- He doesn't know.
- Here.
You never saw one of these things before, did you?
It's for growing daisies, isn't it?
- Or for planting lilies for people's graves.
- No, sahib.
What became of these people here?
- He doesn't know.
- That's good.
We'll take them back with us and let the Colonel put them through the mangle.
No. Will not go with the white sahib.
You will never leave here.
Already your graves are dug.
By nightfall, Ma Kali will be smiling.
Never mind the second chorus. Come on.
Party, form a square!
Under cover, everybody! Get in there!
Take cover in the courtyard.
Close the gates.
Climb the wall, everybody!
Come on, men, on the roof!
Look out, Mac!
Take cover behind the wall.
Volley firing. Ready?
Ready? Get set. Fire!
Here you are, Cutter.
Get in there. Come on.
Ballantine, come up!
Let's go.
Here's a present for you.
Bal, catch!
Come on, let's go!
Charge!
Everybody under cover!
Get behind the wall. Come on. Hurry up.
- Panee, Sergeant sahib?
- No!
How did you get here?
You're a funny bloke, Din... but I'll admit you're a good bhisti.
- Could be first-class soldier, sahib.
- Don't make me laugh.
Get to the river!
- Come on, you savage, over you go.
- Over you go.
All right, give me that.
What's the matter, Bal?
You've been woolgathering ever since we crawled out of the river.
- You know, my time is up on May 14.
- What of that?
You can sign on for another nine years, can't you?
Make a man out of him.
I'm leaving the service.
- Leaving the service?
- That's right.
I'm getting married, and I'm going in the tea business.
- Married!
- Tea business!
Why, you're mad if...
March to attention, everybody!
Let's march in in good style, men.
- Fall in up there.
- Left, right, left.
Tell the Sergeant to report at the office immediately.
Yes, sir.
Party, right wheel!
Halt! Left face!
Sergeants to the front!
The wiring party's returned from Tantrapur, sir.
Eight killed, three wounded.
Otherwise all correct.
Very well, Sergeant. Dismiss your men... and report at the office immediately.
Very good, sir.
Party, dismissed!
- Identical, Mitchell.
- Good heavens, a Thug pickaxe.
It's incredible, but that's what happened to Markham.
I'm afraid they've done away with poor Burgess, too.
There's been none of this for 50 years.
Thuggee. That's what it is, Mitchell.
What's Thuggee, sir?
A murder cult Col. Sleeman crushed
50 years ago.
The Thugs were the most fiendish band of killers that ever existed.
There were at least 10,000 in India, and they murdered 30,000 people a year.
Thuggee was practiced from the Himalayas to Ceylon.
The order was religious and worshipped
Kali, the goddess of blood.
The Thugs were stranglers, weren't they, sir?
Stranglers. They dug the graves of their victims in advance.
Mitchell, we must stamp this out immediately.
The Lancers will scour the country west of Tantrapur...
- you will search the regions to the east.
- Right.
- What do we do, sir?
- You're dismissed, Ballantine.
MacChesney, you and Cutter will leave tomorrow with a stronger...
Ballantine, you're dismissed.
You and Cutter will take a stronger detachment tomorrow... into Tantrapur, to finish your work.
Maj. Mitchell and I will be in close touch with you at all times on either flank.
Keep your eyes open for Thugs.
Ballantine would be a great help, sir.
If I may remind you... the three of us have always brought off things very well together.
Yes, sir. He's indispensable.
Ballantine's leaving the service in six days.
He's getting married.
Couldn't you put your foot down?
Forbid the banns? Something like that?
When the parson says, "Speak now or forever hold your peace"... couldn't you give him a roar, sir?
You know what I mean?
Higginbotham will replace him.
Dismissed.
- Tommy, I've got you back again.
- And I've got you.
I'm here to stay, forever and ever.
Forever and ever.
That's horrible.
- She's charmed him like a snake.
- The siren.
Wouldn't believe it if I didn't see it with my own eyes.
Me, neither.
I can't stand it.
Me, too.
Left! Right! Center!
As you were!
Company, attention!
Right turn!
Two paces forward. March!
Head up, chin in.
Get those thumbs behind the seams of your trousers...
Get them back.
Lower that left shoulder an eighth of an inch. That's much better.
Otherwise you're looking very regimental, Din.
Thank you, Sergeant.
- Was salute satisfactory?
- That's the idea... only you want these fingers to fan the eyebrows, more like this.
The breeze from them fingers ought to almost blow this eyebrow off.
Now try it again.
Very good, indeed.
That one almost blew your turban off, didn't it?
Very regimental, Din.
Keep them at it, Subedar sahib.
They may need it.
Tell the Subedar to drill the men till sundown.
- Where did you get the bugle, Din?
- Please, sahib, I find when nobody looking.
Don't you know that's very naughty?
Please, sahib, don't take away.
Bugle only pleasure for poor bhisti.
Thank you, sahib.
- Sahib care to hear new call?
- Not now.
Very regimental, Din.
Company, attention! Company, dismissed!
Let me see your tongue, Annie.
I'd like to try it, Sergeant sahib.
Very old Indian remedy.
All right, go ahead. But be careful.
If anything happens to her, I'II...
Understand? Cry my eyes out.
No, sahib!
Very little bit goes very long way.
Gulp it down quick.
Then you won't taste it.
I know. You want your daddy to give it to you, don't you?
Daddy will give you the medicine.
Give it to me.
There. Be a nice girl, now.
Or you'll never be strong and big like Daddy.
If Daddy took a spoonful first himself,
Baby might do a patty-cake for him.
This is delicious.
This is...
All for a nice little elephant girl.
This is lovely.
You ain't so stupid as you look.
That's better.
Annie, don't ever worry me like that again.
There you are, you two.
I've got letters for both of you.
There. Sgt. MacChesney and Sgt. Archibald Cutter.
Look what it says here.
"Miss Emaline Stebbins requests the pleasure...
"of Sgt. Archibald Cutter's company at a"...
What's that?
"...betrothal dance preceding her marriage to Sgt. Thomas Ballantine.
"8:00 p.m. Friday." That's tonight.
I worried so about you, dear, while you were away.
Perfectly awful things must have happened at Tantrapur.
It was rather touch and go there for a bit.
- You haven't told me yet about it yourself.
- No, I haven't, have I?
I had to give my undivided attention to the repairing of the wires.
Cutter and MacChesney should have watched out for the enemy... but they were off chasing butterflies or something like that.
I finally got the detachment to the river, and we dived in and escaped.
Tommy, you're so marvelous.
That's all there is to it, I suppose.
On the last roof we almost lost MacChesney.
His great elephant hoof crashed through and stuck.
- How did you get him out?
- We had to saw his leg off at the hip.
If you don't believe me, just look behind that shrub.
Save some for the elephant.
Destroy the evidence.
- Stand guard, will you?
- Yeah.
Never mind that, Sergeant. Stand easy.
- Good evening, Colonel.
- Evening, Stebbins.
- Good evening, Major.
- How are you?
No formality.
We just dropped in to wish little Emmy the best of luck.
That's very nice of you, sir.
I'll bring Emmy to you.
- Looks like a jolly party, Sergeant.
- Yes, sir. Very jolly, sir.
Is that a punch bowl you're shutting out?
Is that punch?
Some peoples calls it a punch, sir, but I calls it swill.
Nonsense. Stebbins is famous for his punch. Have a spot?
Rather.
Excuse me, sir.
I wouldn't touch it if I were you, sir.
Too watery, sir. Besides, it'll rust in the lining of your stomach.
- We'll be the judge of that.
- Wait, sir. There's a fly.
- I don't see a fly.
- Neither do I.
There it is, sir. It just dove under the ice.
I'll get the little nipper in half a jiffy.
I got him.
Hear him? Humming like a beehive.
He's gone.
Ain't that a shame? There he goes.
Come along, Mitchell.
I think we'll forget the punch.
Tommy, you know we have
Sgt. Higginbotham to thank... for your being let out of the expedition.
That's right.
The Colonel says I'm the only man sharp enough...
- to replace Sgt. Ballantine.
- That's very flattering.
I'm only glad to be so some help in, shall we say, Cupid's service.
One thing I can promise... with Cutter and MacChesney about, you won't have one dull moment.
I've got a feeling they don't like me very much. It's just as well.
- The army's no place for sentiment, I says.
- That's right.
Excuse me.
I've got a pebble in my left boot.
Hello, Higginbotham.
- How would you like to come with me?
- What?
I'd like to discuss a few of my military theories with you.
I'd like to have a little chat, get to know each other better.
- How about a bit of a drink, Bert?
- Thanks, Cutter.
- Where's Ballantine?
- Never mind that civilian.
I got Bertie Higginbotham, his replacement.
Bertie's got a thirst like a derby winner, haven't you, Bertie?
We can look after that, old boy.
Take a plunge into this punch.
Punch? That stuff's for drummer boys and old ladies.
- Not that stuff.
- That would knock a horse down.
Swill that down, me boy... and you'll think all the Thugs in India is a bunch of missionaries.
That's right, Bert.
That's a funny thing.
The punch tastes all right.
It's all right.
Bert, how about having another drink?
To the new comradeship, Mac and you and me and the regiment forever.
- That's it, Bertie, my boy.
- I'll drink to that.
All right.
Here's to good old Bertie Higginbotham... the finest soldier since
William the blooming Conqueror.
Down the hatch, boys!
Which of these two do you prefer?
I don't know. Try them both.
One for each window.
Don't be silly, darling.
It's as much your problem as it is mine.
- I know.
- These curtains are for your den.
My den?
What's this, Sergeant?
Buying a trousseau?
We're buying curtains.
I thought it was for underpants, the kind civilians wear in the tea business.
Will you two leave and stop annoying Tommy?
I'd like to oblige, but we're marching off to Tantrapur in 20 minutes... and Tommy's marching with us.
But Higginbotham's replacing him.
The Colonel said...
Higginbotham's in hospital, Miss.
I grieve to say, Miss, that the man is a tower of pain.
- Something he must have ate.
- Or drank?
Sgt. Ballantine, fall in!
- Tommy.
- It's the Colonel's orders, Miss.
Tommy, these friends of yours have engineered this behind your back.
Don't cry, darling.
Goodbye.
This is May 9.
I'm going with you for five days, and good company I'll be... but at sunset on May 14, when my time is up... wherever we are, I'm going to knock you two apes' heads together.
Now come on.
- Pardon me, madam.
- Fall in!
Your petticoat's showing.
Ek Number! All's well!
Do Number!
All's well!
Teen Number! All's well!
Chaar Number! All's well!
Paanch Number! All's well!
Swing those picks there.
You think this is a strawberry festival?
Shake a leg with that pole.
Come on, get it up there at the double.
This is a fine time for things to go quiet.
Blast them Thugs.
Why don't they come and give us a good fight?
Then Bal will be a pipe to re-enlist.
Come on, hurry up, I told you.
How can we get a nice little war going?
What if I were to blow up the Taj Mahal or one of them sacred tombs?
What do you want to do, start the Indian Mutiny again?
Annie, get your back into it! Hurry up!
He's even snarling at poor little Annie.
You can't work 24 hours a day, you know.
In another 24 hours, my time will be up.
I don't want to leave anything undone that might detain me.
Get it up, hurry up.
He's tired.
It just goes to show you what a piece of dry goods will do.
A brilliant bloke like him, too.
Cutter, we got to do something.
Come here.
- What now?
- Look, Mac... for four days we've been waiting for them Thugs to start something.
Four days in this cruel heat and horrible tension.
- What's that to do with Ballantine?
- I'm coming to that.
Go on.
Three hours from where we're sitting, by a secret trail... there's a gold temple waiting to be sliced away and carried off.
Have you started after this buried treasure again?
Just a minute, Mac. This one ain't buried.
According to Gunga Din, it's standing right out in the open.
According to Gunga Din, eh?
I thought he might have been at the bottom of this.
What's the idea of this lushing?
- Give me that bottle.
- Wait!
Just a minute.
MacChesney, I'm here to speak, and I'm going to have my say.
You want Ballantine to stay with us, don't you?
- Of course I want him to stay.
- All right. Just a minute.
It's as easy as parting your hair.
We take Bal to the temple, show him the gold... and the moment he starts slicing at it... marriage and the tea business will whiz from his mind.
MacChesney, versus that, you can't think of a single argument.
Cutter, I'm warning you.
- What's the matter with you?
- What's the matter with me?
I'm sick of it! Now shut your trap.
- You mean you won't go?
- No!
And if you mention gold temples again to me...
I'll tear the back right off you with a shovel.
Very well, MacChesney, you made your choice.
I offered you the chance to be a millionaire... and you turned it down.
All right, I'm going alone.
Wait a minute!
Cutter, you ain't leaving this village without my permission.
Give me that bottle.
I've been a soldier for 14 years.
I know my duties as well as you do.
But you're not talking to a soldier now, you're talking to an expedition.
I'm an expedition. Out of my way.
Cutter, sit down before I throw you down.
Make way for the expedition, if you know what's good for you.
Goodbye forever.
Stand back.
I'll throw you in the clink if you make a move.
Out of my way before I split your jaw.
- Cutter, I'm warning you.
- Come on, put 'em up.
Come on, out of my way.
I'll bash your ugly face in, that's what I'll do.
Come on, put 'em up.
I'm afraid I have to do it.
Sgt. Ballantine.
- What?
- Come here.
Poor fellow's taken with a dizzy spell.
Lock him up safely until he comes to.
I'll lock him up. I'm only sorry you didn't have a dizzy spell, too.
Then I'd lock you both up at the same time.
Good old Din. What's up?
Tonight, when everyone sleep,
Din go back again.
- See gold.
- You did?
Where is it?
Didn't you bring any with you?
Bhisti cannot carry whole temple.
- Whole temple?
- Din see it. All gold.
Here, now.
We've got to get out of here now.
Get me some tools that I can rip these blinking bars out with.
- Already bring all tools could find.
- Yeah.
Is this satisfactory, sahib?
Think I want to break out of a blooming pudding?
Go on, get something big. Jaldi!
Up, Annie. Please, Annie.
What are you doing, Din?
A large tool you asked for, sahib.
Annie, come on, pull these blinking bars out for me.
Work for me. Get me out of here, Annie.
Come on, Annie. Be a good girl.
Whoa, Annie! Just the bars!
Alert the guards!
- Wake up!
- What?
The Thugs are here!
Why didn't you say so?
I'd like to get a crack at them.
What happened?
- Dacoits slipped in and stole elephant.
- What's that?
Thugs stole Annie.
Stole Annie? They'll stoop to anything.
How many were there?
- Couldn't see.
- Where did they go?
- The hills.
- Sound assembly.
Sgt. Ballantine, pick 16 men and follow me.
MacCheesecake, if this is another of your tricks...
Fall in the remainder!
Put every man on guard duty!
- Very good, sir.
- Steal Annie, will they?
I'll break every Thug's back in India!
Din, are you sure you're on the right trail?
Yes, sahib. Here is the bridge, sahib.
- Is this bridge safe?
- It's safe, sahib.
Safe? What do you mean, safe?
Make her stop that.
She's making me nervous.
Get out of my way.
It's no time to do a thing like that!
Annie! Take your foot off.
Annie! Take your trunk off.
Annie, please go back!
That's gold, bugler.
Look at it, bugler.
That's yours and mine.
Archibald Cutter, the blooming duke, look at me, and Rajah Gunga Din... pouring diamonds out of that there blinking water bag.
Bugle will be very satisfactory.
Come on, Din. The world is ours.
Kali. Sahib, come quick.
Thugs, lift up your faces... to the light that shines from Kali's throne.
Brothers in Thuggee... we are the friendless of this earth.
Every man's hand is against us.
We have been kicked, spat upon... and driven to the hills like wild things.
My father was a Thug, and he was hanged.
His father was blown from a cannon's mouth.
And what of your kinsmen, your fathers and their fathers... and their fathers' fathers before them?
My brothers, a new day is at hand.
I have read the omens, and they are good.
Three nights ago, a jackal screamed upon the left.
Another answered from the right at once.
What does that mean, my brothers?
It means that Mother Kali, with all her arms outstretched... hugs us to her bosom, welcoming us back as Thugs...
Thugs awakened from a sleep... of 50 years.
Let the neophytes and their teachers draw near.
Where are the stranglers?
Give them their strangling cloths.
Give them their burial picks.
Swear by our Mother Kali... to be thrice faithful to her and to me and to our order... and to all of us.
Rise, our new-made brothers.
Rise and kill.
Kill, lest you be killed yourselves.
Kill for the love of killing.
Kill for the love of Kali. Kill!
It's them all right, Din, the whole blinking lot of them.
Very bad men.
The Colonel's got to know.
You must get there, Din.
The Colonel's got to know.
The Colonel? I run quick.
Since mighty roast beef
is an Englishman's food
It accounts for the freedom
that runs in his blood
For generous living
Does it do all good
Excuse me, mates.
Oh, the roast beef of England
And, oh, the old English roast beef
Sing us a song, will you?
You're all under arrest.
The whole bunch of you.
And you, too. You know why?
Her Majesty's very touchy about having her subjects strangled.
I can't waste any more time.
Come on, wrap up your gear.
You're coming with me. Hurry up.
Guruji.
If it ain't young Toad Face.
Fancy meeting you here.
Vile dog.
For that insolence, you shall grovel before my son.
You shall grovel, I say!
Look here.
I'm a soldier of Her Majesty the Queen, and I don't grovel before any heathen.
Kabul, take him to the tower... and teach him the error of false pride.
Take him away!
In those drear gray hours before dawn, just go out and chase elephants.
Beats counting sheep a million miles.
What do you mean, elephants?
This ain't elephants.
This is Annie, my Annie.
I'll find her if I have to turn out the whole British Army.
What the blazes is this?
Good morning, gentlemen.
Good morning.
What the blazes are you here for?
I've come to replace Sgt. Ballantine.
Higginbotham,
I could just fall on your neck.
I got a better neck than mine you can fall on.
That's a good one. Hello, there!
Tommy, hello!
How wonderful of you to meet us.
I came here to surprise you, and here you are, surprising me.
- Good morning, Sgt. MacChesney.
- Good morning, Miss.
Here are Tommy's discharge papers.
Cutter will be very pleased about this.
- Column of threes!
- Eyes front!
Sit up straight there!
Who do you think you are, a lot of blinking nursemaids in Hyde Park?
Walk march!
Forward!
Party, halt!
Sgt. Ballantine, take charge.
Go inside, dear. I'll be right with you.
All right, but do hurry, so we can leave soon.
- Naik, what about this?
- He just came back, Sergeant sahib.
Come here, you.
Din, I knew you was at the bottom of all this.
Didn't you knock down the shed and take off Sgt. Cutter?
You'll answer to me.
We'll have a court-martial here and now.
- Line up a firing squad.
- Please, sahib.
You stole the elephant, didn't you?
Answer me!
You knocked down a building and liberated Her Majesty's prisoner...
Sgt. Cutter, didn't you?
- Yes, sahib.
- That's all! Take him away!
You Lazarushian beggar, it'll be the firing squad for you this time!
Wait a minute, Mac. Where's Cutter?
Din, where is Sgt. Cutter?
- They catch him.
- What's that? Who?
In the gold temple, they catch Sgt. Cutter.
Who's they? Priests or what?
Very bad men. They'll give him torture.
Go help, quick.
- How many men?
- Don't know.
- I run away quick to bring help.
- I'll bet you ran away quick.
And you'll run back just as quick, too.
Show me the way.
- I'll pick a dozen men.
- You'll pick nothing! I'm going alone.
You haven't a chance.
I'm not killing Cutter by riding in with a troop.
They'll cut him up if we have a rescue party.
- Right. We'll go together.
- No.
Tommy, what's the matter?
Cutter got himself into a mess, and Mac and I are going to get him out.
Don't worry, I'm not taking him.
I'm going as a sergeant in Her Majesty's service.
- I'm not taking any civilians with me.
- Who's a civilian?
It says here,
"Thomas Anthony Ballantine...
"is restored to the rank of citizen of Great Britain...
"and his duty to Her Majesty's service is over and done with."
Try and keep me out of this.
I'm saying goodbye, Bal, and I wish you luck in the tea business... and your matrimony both.
Wait a minute, Mac.
Wait right here. I have to talk to him.
- But he said you can't go.
- He'll change his mind.
- I won't let you go!
- Darling, I have to go. I owe it to Cutter.
- He's saved my life time and again.
- You don't love me.
Do you want me to go through life remembering that I ran out... on one of my two best friends?
After what they did to Higginbotham, and dragging you up here again?
That's just the way of showing their friendship.
I hate the army, I'm through with it, but friendship, that's something else.
But we're wasting valuable time.
You have to understand. I'll be right back.
- I want to talk to you.
- You? I don't want to argue...
I'm going if I have to shoot you and go alone.
You know as well as I do why you can't go.
If anything happens to you,
I'd be in a fine mess.
Your girl would prefer charges.
- She wouldn't.
- I don't trust her.
There's only one way I'll risk it.
- What's that?
- For you to sign up.
When we get Cutter, we'll tear up the papers.
It'll be according to regulations.
Is that fair enough for you?
You're getting clever again.
Do you want me to get kicked out of the army?
All right, I'll sign, but on one condition.
That I hold the blank in my hand and I keep it after I'm through.
You don't trust me.
That's right.
All right.
What are you doing with that in your pocket?
I always carry one. In case.
No, you don't.
Not a word of this to Emmy, you understand? Shake on it?
Hurry up.
Excuse me, miss.
Sgt. Ballantine and I are going out on a reconnoitering expedition.
- Yes, sir.
- If we're not back by morning... inform the Colonel, and you follow our trail.
- Come this way.
- Excuse me, Miss Stebbins.
- I'm going, Emmy. He's changed his mind.
- Who made him change it?
- Reason and common decency.
- You're lying.
Would I lie at a time like this, just before our wedding? Be reasonable.
You didn't sign anything?
Why ask a question like that?
Do I look that stupid?
Just pretend I'm going off on a picnic.
That's all it'll amount to.
We'll get Cutter out of that gold temple without firing a shot, just by strategy.
We've done things like this before.
It's just a lot of fun.
- Fun? You want to go.
- Darling...
- Sgt. Ballantine, fall in!
- Right, sir.
He called you sergeant.
Why? You're not in the army.
It's just an old habit, hard to break.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Why don't you come right out and say you don't want to get married?
You'd rather be with him.
Why fool me by telling me how you hated him and his ugly face... and all the ugly faces in the army?
- I didn't say quite that. Be fair.
- Please, sahib, hurry.
- Come on, Sergeant!
- Can't you wait a minute?
Sure, I can wait, but I'm not so sure about Cutter.
- Can't you trust me? Kiss me goodbye.
- No, never.
They're probably slicing Cutter's ears off by now.
- I'm coming, Mac!
- Darling, please don't go.
You don't want a man for a husband.
You want a coward who'll run out on a friend in danger.
That's not me, and never will be.
I don't care how much I love you, and I do, very much...
I'm a soldier... I mean, I'm a man first.
All right, MacCheesecake, get that silly smirk off your face.
- Come on.
- Let's go.
Surely Mother Kali is kind.
One Englishman fly walks in, and now our web is baited.
More will follow.
Two more have crossed the bridge.
It is well. Prepare.
You said this place was full of priests.
- Sahib do not give Din chance to say.
- You've got a mouth, haven't you?
Quiet. It's Kali.
A Thug temple.
Why didn't you tell me they were Thugs?
I've a good mind to split you in two and stuff you up an elephant's trunk.
MacChesney roar so loud... poor bhisti cannot get a word sideways between roarings.
Enough of that. We're here to find Cutter.
We should have brought every man in the regiment.
I only wish you had, sahib.
Hello, Din.
Fine work, bugler. I knew you'd do it.
Thank you, sahib.
- Hello, boy.
- Hello, mate.
You're alive, anyway. What's this?
I'll chop you down right away.
So there you are, you white-livered elephant-stealing treasure hunter.
Look at you, hanging there like a lamb in a butcher's shop.
Where's the troop?
There's no troop, and the Guru has us.
We right walked into it.
You mean to tell me you didn't bring the troop?
What a brain!
I round up every Thug in India, and you mess it up with that pygmy brain!
I couldn't face my own men if I brought them to witness your shame... disgracing Her Majesty's uniform.
Shame? They're doing this to me to find out where the column is.
They plan to ambush and massacre the Colonel and the whole troop.
- You didn't tell them, did you?
- Not me.
So I suppose you think you're a hero?
- That's right.
- A hero. Don't make me laugh.
Every man at the post looking for these blighters... and I reconnoiter adroitly and encounter them... while you cowards hide behind your telegraph poles in Tantrapur.
Who's a coward?
- Untie him, will you?
- Yes. Untie me.
I said untie him!
Sgt. Ballantine, untie that man!
You displease me greatly, and I ignore the both of you.
- I'll untie him myself.
- Yes, that's right.
Only one hand, that's all I need at you.
Just one hand.
- Hurry up about it.
- I'll take all day, if you order me around.
I owe you one, anyway.
Mate, look at your back.
- Never mind that. Untie my hands.
- Just look what they did to you.
I'm sorry, mate. The fiends!
- The Guru.
- Filthy scum.
- Dog.
- Maniac.
- Let's get him.
- Here we go.
Grab him regardless how many are with him. It's our only chance.
He's sacred, so they won't shoot us.
Why, you hairless dog.
Look what you did to that man's back, you filthy...
A lesson in the error of false pride, Sergeant.
You're talking very proudly yourself.
Perhaps you're not too proud to give a little information I seek.
- I want to know about your army.
- Why don't you enlist, mate?
Lash.
For a beginning, this is not bad.
Three soldiers to be given to Mother Kali... three soldiers and a slave.
- Who is slave? I am a soldier, too, please.
- You're what?
Regimental bhisti.
Proud ox, where is your army?
How soon are they to follow?
Wouldn't you like to know?
Why don't you look in your crystal ball?
Make the ox talk.
You dirty pack of cowards!
Never mind him. Now. He's next.
- I'm waiting. Will you speak?
- I don't know.
Hold on, Mac, old boy!
Stop.
Look. See them down there... coiling and wiggling, sticking their pretty tongues out?
Are you going to speak?
Throw him in. He'll talk from there.
- No, I can't stand it!
- Will you speak?
All right.
If I ain't kissed by one of them snakes, I'll tell you.
Take me outside.
- Be a man, Mac.
- I can't go it, mates!
Come back, Mac, old boy!
- Well, Sergeant?
- All right, guvnor.
I don't know the exact position of the troops... but in Ballantine's pocket there's a paper with all the troop movements in it.
- You're sure of that, Sergeant?
- As sure as taxes, guvnor.
- I wouldn't fool you.
- I hope not.
If you have, there'll be worse than lashes.
Please don't lash me any more.
I'll relieve you of these.
Cut him down.
"Sgt. Thomas Ballantine hereby reenlists."
That's you, MacChesney, always hiding behind regulations... you Brummagem turncoat!
Be gallant in defeat, Sergeant.
You're simply a victim of superior strategy.
Quiet, you Whitechapel scum, or I'll cut your slaggedy hands off at the wrist!
- I'll pay you back with horrible interest!
- I command you to shut up!
Tell your men to lay down their arms and get out of here, or you're a dead kipper.
Lay down your arms and leave.
- Where do those stairs lead to?
- Not to freedom.
- We'll see about that. Ready?
- Right.
- Sgt. Cutter, guard that door.
- Right. Mac, take your coat.
Right. Get up.
It's young Toad Face blazing up the Thugs.
I'll start with him first.
No, you won't.
Gentlemen, what do you think of your freedom now?
All right, my friend, if we've got to die, you've got to die, too.
As long as I'm alive, you live.
- What did he say?
- He says he'll be unharmed.
He says to keep order, be confident, and wait.
Congratulations, Sergeant... on your knowledge of our humble language.
That's enough. Get under the shade... before you get sunstroke.
Go on. Get on back.
Wounds feel satisfactory, sahib?
I ain't had a more satisfactory set of welts since I ran away from home.
- Thank you.
- Fall in.
Come on.
- Get down. Look out.
- Watch your head.
- The gold!
- Yes, sahib, gold!
Look at it, mates! Gold! That's what it is!
- Real solid sunshine!
- Sit down, you fool!
See that hand sticking out?
I bet that little hand's worth £3,000 if it's worth a farthing!
Who's a blinking idiot now?
We're rich, mates. Come on!
All right, Mr. Wise Man, here's my last offer.
You order your men to get in behind them rocks... and you see us down as far as the bridge.
We'll let you loose, and there's no harm done.
How's that?
Speak, you ape, or I'll kill you.
You would throw away your shield, brave soldier?
- Do you hear something, Bal?
- The bagpipes, Mac?
I've been hearing them for hours, but it isn't them.
It's the blistering heat screaming in our ears... that makes it sound like it.
They'll pull us out, old boy... if they can find the blasted place.
Don't waste any of your guff on me, Mac.
Here we are, and this is it.
It might have been worse, though.
I might have left a widow.
Eight feet away from where I'm sitting, right here... there's enough gold to make me sole owner and proprietor... of a pub as big as the Crystal Palace.
Best pub in Hampshire. And here I am.
You torturer!
Setting that in front of my eyes.
Is there no limit to the torture an Oriental mind can think up?
So help me, if you mention gold again,
I'll tear the tongue out of your head.
Here it is. Get it.
Brave soldiers, can it be that your nerves are tightening?
We can stand it up here as long as you can, Mr. Wise Man.
Preserve your courage, gentlemen.
You are not forgotten.
They will come to save you.
That's right, mate.
You're going to see more soldiers than you ever saw before.
Gentlemen, good news.
Here's a sight that should make your hearts pound faster. Look.
The Lancers.
Look at the Black Watch out in front.
Those beautiful Scotties.
I'll buy them all a beer apiece.
Your comrades' coming chokes you with emotions.
Seeing them this way recalls to you all manner of pleasant things.
The gaiety of barrack life, old friendships... even England... even home.
You bet it does, mister.
Save your voices, gentlemen.
They're coming here to your rescue.
You tormenting fiend.
- You're so sure, aren't you?
- Quite sure. It is my plan.
Two come to rescue one... then the others follow.
If you planned it right, mate... you'll be hanging by your filthy neck by nightfall.
You think so, Sergeant?
I'm not so sure.
You seem to think warfare an English invention.
Have you never heard of
Chandragupta Maurya?
No.
He slaughtered all the armies left in India by Alexander the Great.
India was a mighty nation then... while Englishmen still dwelt in caves and painted themselves blue.
Look.
Don't be afraid, gentlemen.
I am still your shield.
It is very simple.
Your army will enter by that gap.
Then they'll proceed halfway down this gorge.
Those are my infantry.
The best mountain fighters in the world.
At a given signal, they will open fire on your troops... driving them forward into the trap.
That is my artillery.
Rather neatly concealed, don't you think?
My gunners greet them with a full salute.
And finally, in come my horsemen.
This is, gentlemen, my household cavalry... similar to that which guards the person of your Queen Empress.
Each man is mounted on a valiant charger... and eager to slay for his guru.
The honor of the thunder in and slaughter of your army falls to them.
I see it in your faces.
Who is this ugly little savage... to snarl so boldly at the British lion?
Prime generals, friends, are not made of jeweled swords and moustache wax.
They're made of what is there, and what is here.
- You're mad.
- Mad?
Hannibal was mad. Caesar was mad.
And Napoleon surely was the maddest of the lot.
Ever since time began... they've called mad all the great soldiers in this world. Mad?
We shall see what wisdom lies within my madness... for this is but the spring freshet that precedes the flood.
From here we roll on, from village to town... from town to mighty city, ever mounting, ever widening... until at last my wave engulfs all India.
My soldiers! March!
- Toad Face, if you make a move...
- Stop, or I'll slit his throat.
Obey me, my son!
Beloved guru, our men will not move if it is to cost your life.
What is my life to the life of our cause? Go!
- No! They will not let you die.
- Go!
No, you don't. We need you.
Wait a minute.
You have sworn as soldiers, if need be, to die for your faith... which is your country, your England.
India is my country and my faith... and I can die for my faith and my country... as readily as you for yours.
Go, chota.
India, farewell.
You have warned the English.
You must die.
Our guru has given his life for our cause. We must not fail him now!
We must get up there and warn the Scotties before they're trapped.
We may not warn them, but we've got to try.
Come on, mates. Let's go.
- Good work, soldier!
- Thank you, sahib.
Look.
Before I have your faces tied to bags of hot ashes...
I want you to watch as though you were rajahs at an Imperial Durbar... while your comrades are slain to the last man.
Bonnie Charlie's now awa '
Safely owre the friendly main
Mony a heart will break in twa
Should he no' come back again
You see, soldiering isn't all war,
Mr. Journalist.
Will ye no' come back again
They're coming in.
- The Colonel's got to know.
- Yes.
Trumpeter, sound off.
Shoot him down!
- You take the left flank, I'll take the right.
- Yes, sir.
They're getting away! Fire!
Good work, bugler.
Fire! Charge!
Cut their heads off.
- Poor old Din. What a mate.
- Mac, look! Here they come!
- Come on!
- Hit them again!
Get them off!
Speak to me, Bal.
They've killed him!
You'll pay for this.
I'll make you pay for this.
Take that. And that!
That's right. I don't trust you.
Why, you dirty, scheming scum.
You rotter.
Charge!
- Everything cleaned up, sir.
- Nice work, Mitchell.
Thank you, sir.
Firing party, halt.
Inwards, turn!
Fire three volleys in the air. Ready!
Present. Fire!
Ready!
Present. Fire!
- Very good, my boy.
- Thank you, Colonel.
- Not half bad.
- Thank you, Colonel.
Let's take a look to the men.
Stand easy, men.
We've all done enough soldiering for one long day.
You were fine today. Particularly fine.
I'd sooner hear that from you, sir, than get a blooming medal.
Thank you, sir.
Perhaps you'd take care of this for me, sir.
And here's a man of whom the regiment will always be proud.
According to regulations, he had no actual status as a soldier.
But those who had the privilege of serving with him today... know that if ever a man deserved the name and rank of soldier... it was he. So I'm going to appoint him a corporal in this regiment.
His name will be written on the rolls of our honored dead... and I...
Let me see that last part again, will you, Mr. Kipling?
Present arms!
"So I'll meet 'im later on
"At the place where 'e is gone
"Where it's always double drill and no canteen
"He'll be squatting on the coals
"Giving drink to poor damned souls
"And I'll get a swig in Hell from Gunga Din
"Yes, Din, Din, Din
"You Lazarushian-leather Gunga Din.
"Tho' I've belted you and flayed you
"By the living God that made you
"You're a better man than I am,
Gunga Din!"
Forward turn!
Straight march!
English
What's the bad news this time?
If this outfit likes to fight this ought to be good news.
Did I say anything about liking to fight?
Special order for the Captain.
- In there. Be sure and knock.
Come in.
Captain LaRoche?
Yes.
- From headquarters, sir.
Make yourself at home.
Can I get you a chair?
- No, sir.
That's all.
Tell the Sergeant to come in...
...in exactly 2 minutes.
- Yes, sir.
Is it orders to go back to the front?
Yes.
- When?
Tonight, now.
- Tonight?
Such a short leave.
It's harder each time you go.
Is it, dear?
It's good to hear you say that.
Monique, I want you to have something.
This was given to me by...
...someone I love very much, my sister.
It's lovely.
I'll say prayers to Our Lady to bring you back safely.
You blessed child.
She knows I'd be lost without you.
You would?
You've been so good, so kind, I...
Is that all?
Paul...
...it tears my heart each time you go back to the front.
Do you know what you just said?
Say it again.
It tears my heart.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
I'll come back.
I always come back. I'm eternal.
Come, dear.
We're moving back up at midnight.
Yes, sir.
Here it is, sir.
Order equipment.
We're in for 3 weeks.
Yes, sir.
Assembly at 11:30.
Yes, sir, but...
- Well?
The replacements, they haven't reported.
I expect you to see they do report.
Yes, sir.
Is that all, sir?
Is that all, sir?
- Listen.
Light out, fires out!
- Sir, I don't understand.
Don't you hear those motors?
They're German.
Hurry up!
- Yes, sir.
Lights out, to cover everybody!
Lights out!
Lights out! Get under cover!
Keep that door closed!
Come in!
Come in out of the lead.
- How can I?
Step back. I'll push up the grating.
Hurry up, jump. Come on.
One more. Hurry up.
Are you hurt?
- No, I...
I don't think so.
When those things land on you, you usually know it.
Sit down here.
See if I can get some light in here.
Now we can...
Well...
...here.
I never expected to find any...
Are you pretty badly shaken?
You'd better have a drink.
Here, try this.
I'll make you more comfortable there.
Poor Fifi.
What a woman she was in her day?
You lie down here.
You'll have to stay here until all this blows over.
There we are.
You like another drink?
- No, thanks.
No?
It turned out to be a great war, didn't it?
I mean, that was a pretty narrow escape you had there.
Gosh I'm awfully glad that you...
I'll be all right.
A little too direct?
Say, I know what I'll do.
I'll play for you.
Are we?
Are we safe here?
I am.
This won't last long.
Lieutenant...
...how did you happen to be here?
I'm establishing a mood.
I'm softening you.
It's the only way to do it, music.
Notice the romance in it?
No, really, how did you happen to be here?
I came in a few minutes before you did.
Notice how the music's getting you?
No.
- No?
You just wait.
You'll begin to quiver like a reed in the storm.
I've never known it to fail.
You see?
I'm sorry, but I...
...feel nothing.
Nothing at all?
To tell the truth I was afraid of something like that.
If you notice...
...the piano's a little out of tune.
Don't move, I'll squeeze in here.
You may have it all. I'm leaving.
- Not yet.
You don't realize the danger with this sky full of death, but I do.
You'll stay here until it's safe again.
Lieutenant, how long have you been at the front?
Almost two years, child.
I'm a veteran.
And you haven't learned yet that when the rain comes...
...they go away?
I know that...
...but I was hoping you didn't. I'm sorry.
I can't understand it.
Nothing I do seems to work.
Perhaps it's because
I'm a veteran too.
Don't go yet. Please, just for a moment.
It was only that...
...you were very lovely to look at...
...and I didn't want you to go away.
You see, it...
I don't know, a soldier doesn't find moments of beauty and so...
...when one does come along be snatches at it.
And why not?
A bomb or a shell may get either of us tomorrow.
Why not take a moment like this and sort of make the most of it?
It may be our last.
That was very dramatic.
Yeah, I rather thought so.
You know, that's the soldier's approach.
Not the enlisted soldier's, you understand. No, he's more pointed.
The commissioned soldier...
...he uses a little more finesse, it seems to me...
...and he beats about the bush a little longer.
And this is your usual approach?
No.
There's a great deal to be said for the enlisted man's practice of...
Have you finished?
Gee...
...if you don't want this, you might have the politeness to slap me...
...because we'll never get anywhere with your attitude.
It's unfair.
Wait, please. I haven't finished.
I was just preparing to apologize.
- You needn't bother.
Will you tell me your name?
No.
At least your hospital unit.
I don't think I'd better.
Goodbye, Lieutenant.
Captain's quarters?
- Right in there, sir.
Thank you.
No, no. If it's not here in half an hour it will be too late.
At ease, men.
I'm the new platoon commander.
- Sergeant Regnier, sir.
How are you, Sergeant?
Fine.
Captain LaRoche here?
- He's expecting you.
Take care of that for me, will you?
Come in.
Lieutenant Denet reporting, sir.
- You should've arrived 2 hours ago.
I ran into a difficulty, sir.
- Air raid?
In a way, yes.
Let's see. In civil life...
...you were a pianist.
I was a student.
Otherwise your record's not bad.
I see no reason to apologize for it.
What you do in the future will mean more than you say of the past.
May we'll leave it at that, sir.
Do you know this sector?
Fairly well.
The outfit I was with took it last June.
We're holding this part of the valley here.
The enemy has the rest.
Right here is our own particular little job.
It's a tough sector.
It's bad...
...but it's going to get worse.
Is that what's disturbing you, sir?
That's not bothering me.
I've got a good bunch of men.
A tough outfit.
- I know they're good.
I've heard of this outfit more that once.
I hope you can live up to them.
The Third Platoon will be yours...
...that's, what's left of it.
Half of it'll be replacements.
Hal.
Don't you bring back many?
No one regrets my losses,
Lieutenant...
...more than I do.
I'm sorry, sir.
Well?
- The replacements are here.
All right.
This is Regnier, your Sergeant.
At your service, sir.
Say, Sergeant.
Yes, sir.
This outfit...
At ease.
- Yes, sir.
You...
...usually lose half of your men?
Sometimes more. We're known as
Captain LaRoche's hard bargains.
Hard bargains?
Whenever there's a bulge in the line or a dirty work to be done...
...they always send for us.
- But with half the men.
How long's the Captain had the company?
Ever since we first came out.
- How many times?
Why...
...about eight times, and he's never even got trench feet.
He's the hardest bargain the lot.
The finest officer in the army.
- But hard.
The finest officer in the army.
- Living on aspirin and cognac.
What the Captain uses is none of my business.
All I know is...
...he's the finest officer in the army.
All right, Sergeant.
Ready for inspection, sir.
- Right.
You've been here before?
- Yes.
Is the shoulder well?
- Yes.
Glad to see you back.
- Thank you.
Take off your cap.
How old are you?
- 44, sir.
Real age?
- Please, Captain.
Bouffiou!
- Yes, sir.
Send this man back.
Yes, sir.
- I...
Your name?
- Dulac, Jean.
Number?
Sorry.
Finest officer...
- Yes, Sergeant, yes, sir.
Soldiers of France...
...you are now members of the Fifth Company...
...Second Battalion...
...of the 39th Regiment of the Line.
This regiment was created...
...by Bonaparte...
...and served gloriously with him through many campaigns.
It also served...
...in the Crimea...
...in Indo-China and in Africa.
Since November, 1914...
...it's been fighting on this front.
Its record of valor...
...has not yet been damaged.
I do not expect any man...
...or any platoon or an entire company...
...to add stature to that record...
...but I do and will require...
...that no man in it detract from that record.
At midnight we move up to the front.
Dismiss!
Yes, sir.
Company at ease...
...dismissed!
Will you shut up?
I'm sorry, I forgot.
If you've got to whistle, give us the other tune.
Taking over.
I can't say I'm sorry.
- Anything new?
No, it feels like they're getting ready.
Two raiding parties out already tonight, after prisoners.
A bad break in the wire after...
- Wait, wait.
One of your men?
- Yes.
How long's he out?
- Since last night.
Why don't you bring him in?
Look over here.
Those bodies out there are the men we sent after him.
They couldn't raise that gun and put him out of his misery.
I'll be out of mine anyway.
I won't have to listen to him.
Good luck.
But I don't care! They let him hang and suffer and suffer!
Tomorrow it may be any of us.
It may be me!
Tenshun!
As you were.
Lieutenant...
...what about that man?
I can't sleep.
- Shut up.
I prefer to die before hearing that.
- Wait a minute.
Two men can get him out.
You and who else?
I'll go.
And you want to go?
My brother died that way last year in front of Souchez.
We listened to him two days before a barrage came.
All right, come along...
...both of you.
Good luck.
Here.
But all I owe you is eight francs.
I'll expect the rest, later.
I'll be here.
- All right.
Over you go.
Stand to and cover these men.
Who is he?
- Denet sent after...
...that man on the wire.
- Fools.
Don't do that, sir.
Are you hit?
- I'm not, he is, in the leg.
I don't have to listen to him any more.
Take him to the rear.
Lend a hand here.
You're a brave man, Denet...
...but you're a fool.
Take over...
...I'm going to the dugout.
Yes, sir.
Jacques...
...watch on here.
How many more days?
Five more.
Then we can get out.
In ten days you'll be getting ready to get back up here again.
Sorry.
Can't you give us the other one once in a while?
My mistake was by buying the music box...
...that didn't have but two tunes in it.
What did you buy that dumb thing for anyhow?
It was very cheap.
You know what to do with that box?
- What?
Take a hand grenade...
...pull the pin, drop it inside and run.
But it isn't paid yet for.
- Go on. Go to sleep.
Time for relief, Dupres.
- All right.
Rousseau.
- Yes.
Clement.
- Yes.
Lights out, everybody.
This place sure needs some perfume.
It seems to me we've got too much perfume here already.
Yeah, but not the right king.
- Shut up.
Sergeant, come here, quick.
- What is it?
Down here, listen.
Do you hear it?
- Quiet.
What is it?
It's a mine, they're digging right down below us.
They'll blow us all to pieces.
- Shut up!
Shut up!
Go and get the captain, quick.
- Right.
I'm getting out of here.
- Me too.
Quiet everybody, quiet!
What's it?
There's a mine.
- They're going to blow us up.
Why not? What do you think you get paid five sous a day for?
Tenshun!
As you were. Where is it?
- Here.
Captain, what are we going to do?
Do?
- Do we go?
Go, where?
Into the next dugout or the next?
They're not trying to blow up us.
If the mine goes off, all of us go.
Suppose I do move you out.
How long would the Boche take to discover it?
They wouldn't need their mine.
You're in no danger now because you can hear them digging down.
They'll not blow up their own sappers. Go on back to bed.
Say, Sergeant.
A double ration of rum all around.
- Yes, sir.
Lieutenant, can't you do something?
Can't you get us out of here?
- He told the truth.
Do we've to stay here?
- Until we're relieved.
What if it blows up before then?
You'll take us out of here?
- Easy.
We'll all get out...
...before it goes.
I certainly could use some of this rum now.
Me too.
A week ago, before the raids...
...they'd blow up a lot more of us.
Yeah.
I suppose if we moved out now...
- Is just want they want us to do.
Move out.
They wouldn't need their mine.
They could walk right through.
Somebody's got to be here.
Hope it isn't us but it's got to be somebody.
I...
...told the men that...
...I'd get them out before it goes off.
You told them?
I told them to stay.
You're the hero and I'm the murderer.
I'd like to tell them to get out.
Do you think I want them to blame me?
Be good enough to tell me how you'll do it.
Look.
How are you going to be able to get yourself out?
Your move.
I laugh when I think about them
Dutchman down there...
...digging all night long.
I laugh when I think of you and that bread and cheese flying over France.
How many men you got here?
There's enough there. Sign that.
What is this?
Steel helmets.
They've just been issued.
How do you like them?
We're sitting over a mine...
...and they're sending us steel helmets for our heads.
You're... What did you say?
They're digging a mine down there.
Say, give me that, I got to get out of here.
Sergeant, a letter for you.
They've stopped digging!
Tell the men to stay at their posts.
- Yes, sir.
Listen.
They're digging again.
'Lf we don't get a payment on your music box within a week...
...you'll find yourself in a pretty serious situation.
Signed Hercules Bureau of Collections'.
They should've been here over an hour ago.
The relief is here, sir.
The relief is here, everybody out. Now take it easy.
Captain, I'd just like to say that...
...I'd...
...like to apologize for the remark about the numbers of replacements.
I didn't understand but I do now.
This company has a record of services such as I never dreamed.
I'm very proud to be with you.
Thanks.
Come on, get going.
Keep moving. Come on.
Come on, come on.
Here's the relief company.
Close it up, men.
Keep going.
Close it up, men.
What's going on up there?
- You'll find out soon.
Quiet up there. Keep moving.
I don't know how they're going to set it off but...
...I'm afraid it won't be long.
I left you with a wounded man on the wire...
...and you leave me a mine to sit on.
- Good luck.
How many were there?
Two platoons, sir.
All right, come on.
Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.
Hello, Sergeant.
- Hello.
Captain LaRoche, is he all right?
- He's all right.
They'll never get him.
Why bullets curve around him like that.
He's sleeping.
I can't, no.
No, I can't.
Sergeant.
Yes, miss.
He's sleeping now and I've to get back to the hospital.
Don't disturb him unless you have to, will you?
Don't you worry, miss.
I'll let him sleep.
Thanks.
Good morning, Sergeant.
Good morning, sir.
- Sit down.
What time is it?
It's just six o'clock, sir.
Six o'clock? Then it's good evening.
Yes, sir, good evening.
Sergeant, where is...
...the hospital in this town, you know, where the nurses are?
That's in a church, sir, on the other...
I was afraid you might be reading something trashy.
No, sir, just keeping up with civilian affairs.
Just refreshing your memory?
Yes, sir.
Where'd you say the hospital is?
It's in a church, at the east side of town.
Order me a motorcycle side-car, will you?
Yes, sir.
Sir.
Yeah?
Will you be finished with my book soon?
I don't know, Regnier, it's difficult to say.
To tell the truth, I find I've to struggle constantly...
...to retain a certain human quality in myself.
But I might turn into a man of steel and gun-powder...
...a fighting machine without any weaknesses whatever.
It's a thing I've to go out against and I find this helps me.
Yes it...
...helps me immensely.
Can I help you, Lieutenant?
I don't know...
...I'm looking for someone.
The name?
I just joined the regiment and the name has slipped my mind.
You know him if you saw him?
Instantly. He's covered with a very peculiar rash.
Rash?
We haven't had no rashes in today.
This is an entirely new thing.
It's called trench rash.
It turns off and on like an electric sign.
I'll browse around and look for him. I know he's here.
I say, nurse.
Yes?
Is the shave going on all right?
Quite all right, sir.
- Fine, fine.
Hello.
Sorry.
I never expected to see you again.
I've been through trying to find you.
You shouldn't have come.
Why not? Isn't it all right for me to be here?
Don't tell me you're a patient here.
No, I'm company. I came to see you.
You'd better go.
Go? I just got here.
Who knows but what I'm sick or wounded or something.
Nobody check up on things like that?
- You really should go.
About the other night, I'm awfully sorry for the way I acted.
I never would...
...if you hadn't thought it'd be successful.
That's right.
You're too young and sweet to be such a veteran.
Nurse.
Some help, please.
All right.
I'm sorry but I'm very busy now.
- I see.
You mean until later this evening?
No, for the duration of the war.
Jeanne!
Yes?
How much do I owe you?
- It's already paid.
By the officer, over there.
Bring us some more coffee, will you? Lots of it.
Wonderful coffee they've here.
Wonderful.
They say the chef got his recipe...
...from and old paint and varnish store.
If only you weren't so persistent.
I know, isn't it terrible?
Try some of my wine.
Cheerio!
What are you thinking?
The things are so different from the other time.
You glad that we came?
I'm glad and...
...sorry too.
I'm afraid to think about it.
I find that something was happening that I'd never expected...
...or even wanted.
I'd such a strange feeling tonight...
...when we came in here...
...together.
I know I felt it too...
...as though we're coming home.
Isn't that it?
Yes.
You saw those guns...
...rumbling up the road?
- Yes.
Yes.
- They're rolling along the front...
...from Switzerland to the sea.
There's no need my telling you that this is the crisis.
This is the biggest allied push yet.
It's going to make what's gone before seem like child's play.
If this attack fails...
...you can write your own story.
At midnight we move up.
Lieutenant, would you make the inspection?
Yes, sir.
Come on, hurry up.
Move on.
Ready.
Pack inspection, come on.
Sergeant.
- What do you want?
Is it true this is the big drive...
...that we're going to the front now?
Tomorrow we'll have breakfast in Berlin. Into line.
Yes, sir.
Into line!
Come on, inspection, come on.
Been up here before?
- Yes, sir.
Throw that away.
- It's good to eat.
Eat here, don't take it with you. Throw it away.
Thank you.
Throw it away.
Hello, Chartis.
- Hello, Sergeant.
Throw that away.
- My wife made it.
All the more reason to throw it away.
Throw that away.
Don't salute me.
I'll salute any soldier of France.
Save it for the officers.
Yes, sir.
And don't you call me sir.
No, sir.
What's your name?
Morain, sir. Sergeant.
So you want to be a soldier?
I want to serve France.
That's a good idea.
What's that Bassoon doing here?
Bassoon?
- Yes, that fish horn.
Throw it away.
Bassoon!
I'll have you know, sir...
...that 45 years ago at Sudan...
...a blast from this fish horn you call it...
...sent the finest cavalry brigade in the world into battle.
Yeah?
- The Emperor heard the call.
You've got to throw it away.
I've carried that trumpet a great many years.
All right, keep it.
Only see that nobody sees it.
Put it in your pack.
You heard what I said.
Throw it away!
Open up.
Throw it away.
War, do you call this war?
Where's your cavalry charges?
And your flags to lead them on...
...and your bugles to blow them forward?
Why you haven't got any?
All you do is dig holes in the ground like rabbits.
Soldiers, why you're a lot of sewer diggers?
Wait till a fine point nine takes hold of the seat of his pants.
What do you know about war?
What do I know about war?
- Yeah.
I was the trumpeter of the Six Cuirassiers.
I blew a charge, I was only 15 when I blew it...
...but I blew a charge that sent the finest...
...cavalry in the world.
- What you got in here?
What you got in here?
Cartridges.
- What for?
In case of an attack.
Inspection!
Come in.
That's all right. Keep your seat.
I wonder if you'd do something for me.
Something personal.
I'm glad to.
I've got a feeling, call it a hunch if you like...
...my luck's run out, that this might be my last trip up.
I hope not, sir.
You do?
Why?
I can say, Captain, is that...
...I wish you might've the privilege of serving under yourself.
Thanks.
I'm glad to have you with me.
You're reckless and a bit crazy but sometimes that helps.
You're a good soldier.
- Thank you, sir.
Sorry for our bad start.
- Let's forget, sir.
Getting back to this other...
...if anything happens why...
...I'd like you to deliver these to a friend of mine.
That's her name.
I've got her picture in this locket.
Here it is.
She's helping at a hospital east of town.
Yes.
I know where it is.
Those papers will explain everything.
There isn't much, but what's left I'd like for her to have it.
She is...
...been very kind to me, much kinder than she realizes.
She's filled a great emptiness.
- I see.
Anything I can do for you?
No, thanks, sir.
I have nobody.
Not even a friend?
I said nobody.
That's too bad.
You'll do this for me then?
I only hope I won't need to.
Inspection finished, sir.
- Good.
Coming, Lieutenant?
- Yes, sir.
Attention!
Soldiers of France...
...you're members of the Fifty Company...
...Second Battalion...
...of the Thirty-ninth Regiment of the line.
It was created by Bonaparte...
...and served with him through many campaigns.
Since November of 19...
Since November 1914 it has been fighting on this front.
Its record of valor has not yet been damaged.
I do not expect any man nor any platoon...
...or even an entire company to add stature to that record...
...but I do and will require that no man in it...
...detract from that record.
Midnight we move out to the front.
Dismiss.
Company...
...at ease!
Dismiss!
Grandpa...
...you can take that ramrod out of your breeches...
...he's through talking.
That's the most magnificent speech I've never heard.
Is a good officer, isn't he?
The finest officer in the army.
Thanks.
- Private Morain...
...report to the Captain right now.
- Yes, sir.
They're making him a general already.
And why not?
France made a young girl a general once...
...and never regretted it.
Private Morain reporting to his Captain.
So you changed your name to Morain?
Yes, sir.
How old did you tell them you were?
48, sir.
Who dyed you hair, old Sacha?
Come on, don't stand at attention...
...you old fool.
My son!
My son!
Lieutenant, this is my father.
How do you do, sir?
- Lieutenant...
...think of it, to serve France under my own son...
...and they wanted to make a clerk out of me.
Me, who blew the last charge at Sudan.
Look at me, don't I look fit?
- You certainly do, sir.
I'll tell you a secret.
I'm over 60 years old.
You'd never think it to look at me.
- Never, sir.
Paul, you're going to be proud of me.
You know all this is new to me, I...
What is it? What's the matter?
I'm proud of you.
I'm proud of you for trying...
...but it can't be done.
You'll not send me back.
- I must.
I can soldier with the best of them.
- No, you can't.
No, you don't know.
I was a soldier before you was born.
You'd know if one man fails
10 others can die with him.
I'll not fail!
- It's a responsibility for me.
I tell I'll not fail.
- You've got to go back.
As your father, I order you to...
- Come to...
...allow me...
...attention!
You can't.
- Attention!
Yes, sir.
Sergeant!
Yes, sir.
Get an order to send back Private Morain.
Reason, unfit for service because of age.
Yes, sir.
Come on, Morain.
I couldn't let him stay.
If he'd have failed...
I don't know.
What'd you have done?
Exactly what you did.
Thanks.
Look out for him, will you?
See that he gets supper before he goes.
I'll be glad to, sir.
I'd be very proud if I had a father like that.
Don't get up.
Isn't there anything that I can do?
I'm afraid not.
Sergeant.
See that Morain gets some warm supper...
...and do anything to make him comfortable.
Yes, sir.
Well, what...
I had to come...
...because you didn't come to me.
You go up tonight, don't you?
And the attack is in five days.
How you did know that?
Everyone knows it.
A woman in love learned it.
Just as I learned it.
Five days.
That's half of the days I know you.
- Monique.
Michele, listen...
...there's something
I haven't told you...
...and I want to told you.
- Is this what you want to tell me?
I...
Is it?
Yes, that's it.
He gave them to me to give to you...
...in case he doesn't come back.
Michele, perhaps I should've told you, but...
...please, try to understand.
Without me...
...he seems to have nobody, nothing.
He's not right somehow he's...
...twisted inside...
...but he's not dead inside.
I told him at first
I didn't love him...
...that some day I might find someone...
...I might find...
...and he said he'd take that chance.
If you only knew what he's done for me, for my family.
They lived near here before the fighting destroyed all we had.
He sent them where they'd be safe...
...and takes care of them still.
Do you understand?
Do you?
Yes, I think I do.
That's what I came to tell you...
...and to tell him too.
Tell him?
Tell him that I love you?
No, that...
...I love you.
You can't do that.
What do you mean?
- You can't.
This is what I mean.
I mean it isn't just he and I and you...
...two men and a girl...
...it's more than that.
That's why you can't tell him.
I didn't like'im at first...
...may be I still don't,
I don't know.
At least I know him now...
I know what...
...he's trying to do.
And I know what you mean to him.
I see.
- Without you he doesn't live.
As far as you and I concerned...
...it's all over, it's finished.
Michele, I...
Let somebody else break it up, not me.
Michele...
...haven't you...
...anything more to say to me?
I...
I think you'd better go now.
Are you telling me...
...you don't love me?
You can...
...call it that, if you like.
Will you kiss me and still say that?
No.
No what.
I won't kiss you.
God bless you, Michele.
Is the car here?
The headquarter car is ready, sir.
Are you tight?
Teeniest possible bit, hardly enough to interest anyone.
They'll blow it out of you.
- Yes, sir.
Come in.
Take the men up.
I'm going to headquarters.
Assembly at 11:00.
You make the inspection.
Full packs number three grenades, extra bandeliers.
Yes, sir.
Are you all right?
I'm quite all right.
I look after the equipment.
How was it?
Ask yourself that in two days from now.
Don't be fresh...
...it's not the first attack I went through in the last 3 years.
Are you going to sign for it?
Write something.
'Sweetheart I love you' anything.
- Don't be fresh...
...here's a kiss for the General.
Is that the order sending me back?
You never can tell...
...they may have transferred you to the Navy.
'Please acknowledge at once receipt of...
...8 camels issued to you at
Sidi Bel-Abbes, Algeria...
...on January 18th, 1892'.
I've been getting this order for the last two years.
It seems that they lost the camel some place.
Here it is...
...here it is, Grandpa.
'Transfer, effective this date, to the...
...automobile transportation section of... '
You really like it to be able to get away from here.
I don't understand that attitude.
With ten million bullets aiming at you every 24 hours.
And if this order hadn't come what would have happened?
No order you stay.
Just this little scrap of paper...
...between me and the field of honor.
Something that the flame of a candle...
...or the fire could destroy in a minute.
Five minutes, Sergeant.
Little things in life mean so much to us.
This wind through the door nearly blew the paper...
...into the fire.
- Yeah.
I mean the paper that is so important for you.
Yes, I know. And if it had...
...I could have gone to the front.
- Yeah.
You could have gone to the front
I could have gone to the rear.
No, no, Sergeant...
...not if the wind from the door had blow it there.
That's true.
- Yes.
That's true.
Speaking about little things in life.
Here am I...
...without as much money as to buy myself a bottle of wine.
You have no money, Sergeant?
- No.
I have some.
But why should you buy me wine?
Because I'm your friend.
So...
...are you friend of mine?
- Yes, indeed.
How much money would you want...
...to buy wine with?
Would the sum of five francs seem exorbitant?
No, no.
- That's all I need.
The great tragedy with this war...
...is that every soldier always hasn't got any money.
That's quite true, that's quite quite true, Sergeant.
Here.
That's yours.
- No, now it belongs to you.
Are you trying to bribe me?
No, no.
- Yes you do.
No, no, Sergeant...
...I merely want to serve France.
You'd die for France if necessary.
- I would indeed.
You would?
- I would.
You would.
- I would.
Why refer to is as a bribe?
I didn't at all.
- Yes you did.
The next time be careful with your tongue.
I swear to you I did not refer to it as a bribe.
You swear?
- Yes.
You do?
- I do.
That's different.
Now...
...supposing the wind from this door...
...would blow on this little...
It would move just like this.
That's exactly the way it would happen, Sergeant.
Now supposing...
...it blows just a little bit stronger...
...like this.
Now suppose it blows...
...very hard...
...that a hurricane.
You mean like this?
Get the men up all right?
There's no causalities, sir.
- Good.
Something else happened.
While we were crossing the area a shell dropped on the 4th section.
One of the men fell on it in order to cover it and protect the others.
But it turned out to be a dud.
- Took a lot of nerve.
I've never seen a bravest act.
- I'll recommend him, who was it?
It was Private Morain.
You mean...
- Yes.
Yes, sir.
Didn't I tell you to get him back?
- Yes, but...
I've a good mind to court martial now.
But the order never come through.
Why didn't you send him back?
- He wasn't there.
He must slipped in the dark...
...but we can watch him.
- Who asked you what we could do?
Is it that I give orders to hear to mysel.
Who's commanding this company?
Why you, sir.
Where's he?
On sentry duty, sir.
That was a brave work,
Private Morain.
Thank you.
I'm proud of you...
...very proud.
I believe you understand...
...the importance of the situation.
I've here a message from our Corps Commander.
'Officer of the Second Army.
You're on the verge of an attack...
...that'll be the greatest of the history of warfare.
You'll fight and ground...
...that has been drenched by the blood...
...of your former comrades.
You'll go forward until you've taken your objectives.
The fate of France...
...and of civilization...
...rests in your hands'.
Signed, Marchand.
Commanding Second Army.
Zero hour is at six, gentlemen.
Six o'clock.
We'd better synchronize our watches.
We'll use as a mark...
...six minutes...
...after one o'clock.
It is now mark...
...minus...
...fifteen seconds...
...twelve seconds...
...ten...
...eight...
...six...
...four...
...two...
...mark.
It's now exactly...
...zero minus five.
You know your objectives.
Try to keep close contact. Good luck.
Good luck to you.
Good luck.
Good luck, sir.
Before we moved up...
...I give you a package for
Mademoiselle LaCoste.
Yes, if necessary.
It won't be.
Nor shall I ask your services in any event. Where's the package?
It's in my trunk in relief billets.
I see no reason why you'd come out of this alive than I...
...possible not as much.
That's all.
Yes, sir.
Zero minus one.
- Yes, yes, sir.
Put that away.
But I want to blow it.
- No, put it away.
Forward!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on! Forward!
Come on! Forward!
We'll have to blow them out.
We'll use grenades.
Take your men in from the south.
Are you ready?
Yes, sir.
- Let's go!
That's the way, Grandpa...
...that's the way.
You know...
...fear is nothing but imagination.
The man is only afraid because he thinks he is.
Will you please stop talking about fear?
But there's no such thing as fear.
It's only in the mind.
If you'll stop reminding me about fear...
...maybe I can be brave too.
Watch over them...
...and keep them safe.
They accept everything...
...the rain...
...the cold...
...the days without sun...
...and rights without sleep...
...the fear and the pain...
...but...
...let them live...
...let them believe...
...that they will live until the very end.
Let them always have that hope...
...always...
...always.
Shut up.
Sorry.
Yes.
We're holding most of the village.
No, they're all around us.
Yes.
I understand.
It'll be done right away.
What shape's your platoon in?
I've 26 men still able to walk, sir.
It's better than I feared.
Your fath...
Private Morain is safe and well.
Did I asked that?
Anyway...
...thanks just the same.
We've got a nasty job to do here.
Headquarters want us to run a line through the village...
...beyond the enemy's position...
...to blow up an observation post.
Do you know what that means?
Not many will get through.
The place is alive with snipers and machine gun nests.
Yes, I know.
It's a volunteer job.
I'll take it.
You'll need about six men.
- I'll be one, sir.
Get five more men.
Get them ready right away.
- Yes sir.
Here's the logical point where I think we'd start.
Wake up.
What do you want?
Volunteers for a wiring party, what do you say?
Anything to get out of this grave.
- Come on.
The men are ready.
We're ready.
- Take half the wire with you.
We'll play the rest out from here. The tools?
Here, sir.
Telephone?
- Here, sir.
See the men have revolvers.
- Yes, sir.
Pardon me, sir...
...your father's rather old...
- He's a soldier in the 39th.
All right...
...ready?
- Yes, sir.
Get going.
Come on.
Keep them covered there.
- Watch this wire.
All right, quiet now and keep down low.
Come along, Grandpa.
Bring those tools.
Come on, hurry.
Come on.
Go ahead.
You all right?
Yes.
Come on, keep going.
The wire's broken.
I'll fix it.
- No you...
Easy.
We'll get you on the way back.
Get going, boys, keep low.
Come on, Morain.
What?
I can't.
- What's the matter?
I can't go out there.
I can't!
You'll get us all killed.
I'm afraid, Lieutenant...
...I'm afraid.
All right.
Give me the stuff.
You stay here with Regnier.
Hello.

- Good work.

Right.
You stay here.
Good luck.
I heard something.
They can't be coming back yet.
Maybe it's the enemy.
Careful take it easy.
Someone's coming.
Might be our boys. Be careful.
- No, no, it's the Germans.

- Be sure.

I didn't know it was you.

- No.
Lieutenant...
...tell the captain I threw the grenade.
I never would have done it.
I never would have thrown it.
- It's too late for that now.
How about getting back?
Can you make it all right?
I'll try, sir.
Come on, give me a hand with Regnier.
Let's get going.
Come on, come on.
Here they come.
Give me a hand here.
Are you all right?
Yes.
Get some brandy.
You'll get a nice long rest out of this.
Much...
...much longer...
...than you think, sir...
...Captain.
Goodbye...
...gentlemen.
It was...
...a lovely war.
What happened?
Regnier was hit.
Morain stayed with him.
On the way back, they mistook us for Germans...
...threw a grenade.
- Who threw it?
Regnier, sir.
Who throw it?
I did, sir.
You're under arrest.
Report to the rear just now.
Yes, sir.
Thanks, Denet.
I appreciate what you tried to do.
Better get that arm fixed up.

...will you?
- Yes, I will.

- Six.

Hello, Major.
- Hello, Denet.

- Yes, it doesn't amount to much.
You're lucky.

Do you know anyone in the 39th?
Yes.
Nurse, will you hold this for me?
Hold it!
This is going to hurt but it's better than an infection.
That's all.
Thank you, Major.

- Monique!
What is it?
Is it bad?
- No, it's just a flesh wound.
I thought that...
- Hand me that sling.
Michele!
- And fill out a report.
Yes.
Feel all right?
- Yes, thank you, nurse.
Monique...
You'll have to tell me...
...when and how it happened.
It was a couple of hours ago.
We were on patrol...
...running a telephone line for the artillery.
That's all.
I can fill out the rest myself.

I love him.

- No, that isn't true.
I'm sorry.
We kept away from each other so's not to hurt you but...
...it's no good. It won't work.

- Captain!
He's in here.

- Message from Headquarters.
Get some bandages too.
- Open it up.

Can't you see he's blind?
My son is blind.

- Won't you read it?

- Read it!
'Counter barrage...
...covering the area in sector point

- Go on, go on.
'A detail must be sent here at once...
...to help with communication with the artillery'.

- Why?
The telephone post is in that sector.
The barrage'd fall on it.
- I know. That runner?

Yes.
- Lieutenant...

- Yes.

But...
- It's a order.

- Did I ask you?
No.
- I'll take care of the order.
Will you hurry along that doctor?
Yes...
...I will.
Are you ready, my boy?
I'll need eyes, father.
I'll be your eyes, son.
Come.
We must hurry.
Hello.
Hello, hello.
There's no answer.
Sure he got the message?
- Yes, sure.
When?
- Two hours ago.
We can't lay this barrage without observation.
Be careful here.

Come in.

All right.
Company, attention!
Soldiers of France...
...you're members of the Fifth Company...
...of the Second Battalion of the 39th Regiment of the line.
This regiment was created by Bonaparte...
...served with him gloriously through many campaigns.
It also served in Indo-China...
...in the Crimea and in Africa.
Since November, 1914, it has been fighting on this front.
Its record of valor has not yet been damaged.
I do not expect any man...
...or any platoon, or even this entire company...
...to add stature to this record.
But I do and will require...
...that no man in it detract from that record.
We move up at midnight.

- From the Russians?
No, from the French.

...defending our country, our fatherland.
Now, my beloved class, this is what we must do:
Strike with all our power.
Give every ounce of strength... to win victory before the end of the year.
It is with reluctance that
I bring this subject up again.
You are the life
of the fatherland, you boys.
You are the iron men
of Germany.
You are the gay heroes
who will repulse the enemy...
when you are called upon
to do so.
It is not for me to suggest that any of you... should stand up and offer to defend his country.
But I wonder if such a thing is going through your heads.
I know that
in one of the schools...
the boys have risen up
in the classroom...
and enlisted in a mass.
But, of course, if such a thing
should happen here...
you would not blame me
for a feeling of pride.
Perhaps some will say...
that you should not
be allowed to go yet...
that you are too young,
that you have homes, mothers, fathers...
that you should not be torn away.
Are your fathers so forgetful
of their fatherland...
that they would let it perish
rather than you?
Are your mothers so weak
that they cannot send a son...
to defend the land
which gave them birth?
And after all,
is a little experience...
such a bad thing for a boy?
Is the honour of wearing
a uniform...
something from which
we should run?
And if our young ladies
glory in those who wear it...
is that anything
to be ashamed of?
I know you have never desired
the adulation of heroes.
That has not been
part of my teaching.
We have sought
to make ourselves worthy...
and let acclaim come
when it would.
But to be foremost in battle...
is a virtue
not to be despised.
I believe it will be a quick war... that there will be few losses.
But if losses there must be...
then let us remember
the Latin phrase...
which must have come
to the lips of many a Roman...
when he stood embattled
in a foreign land.:
"Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori."
"Sweet and fitting it is
to die for the fatherland. "
Some of you
may have ambitions.
I know of one young man
who has great promise as a writer...
and he has written the first act
of a tragedy...
which would be a credit
to one of the masters.
And he is dreaming, I suppose...
of following in the footsteps
of Goethe and Schiller...
and I hope he will.
But now our country calls.
The fatherland needs leaders.
Personal ambition must be thrown aside... in the one great sacrifice for our country.
Here is a glorious beginning
to your lives.
The field of honour calls you.
Why are we here?
You, Kropp, what has kept you back?
You, Mueller, you know how much you are needed?
Ah, I see you look at your leader.
And l, too, look to you,
Paul Baumer... and I wonder what you are going to do.

I've been waiting for this for three weeks.

And I cooked for 150!

- Tomorrow.

- That's a good idea.
- Let's do that.
- How far is the dressing station?
- About two miles.
- We could take his things to him.
- Good.
It seemed rotten to think of a thing like that happening to him... a nice fellow like Kemmerick.
Ah, the French certainly deserve to be punished for starting this war.

We didn't either of us want any war, so I'm going home.
- He's there already.
- Somebody must have wanted it.
Maybe it was the English.
No, I don't want to shoot any Englishmen.
I never saw one till I came up here.
And I suppose most of them never saw a German till they came up here.
- No, I'm sure they weren't asked about it.
- No.

- Not me and the kaiser.
- I think maybe the kaiser wanted a war.
You leave us out of this!
I don't see that.

- And manufacturers. They get rich.

Nobody wants it in particular... and then all at once, there it is.
We didn't want it.
The English didn't want it.
And here we are fighting.
I'll tell you how it should all be done.
Whenever there's a big war comin' on...
- you should rope off a big field--
- And sell tickets.
Yeah. And--
And on the big day... you should take all the kings and their cabinets and their generals... put them in the centre dressed in their underpants... and let 'em fight it out with clubs.
- The best country wins.
- [ All Groan, Murmur ]
Well, now that Kat's settled everything, let's go see Kemmerick.
- Something interesting might happen on the way.
- Might cheer him up.

- We'll be back.
- Give the boy my regards.

- How are things going?
- Are they looking after you all right?
How are they treating you?
Franz?
[ Groaning ]
They're robbers here.
Robbers.
They stole my watch!
I always told you, nobody should carry as good a watch as that.
- They took it while I was under ether!
- Franz, you'll get it back.
Do you feel all right?
-Just look at my hand.
- That's because you lost so much blood.
-Just eat decently and you'll get well again.
- Oh, no.
You must eat. That's the main thing.
It looks good too.
I have such a terrible pain in my foot.
Every toe on my right foot hurts.
Well, how can your foot hurt when your leg's been--
[ Hysterically ]
I know what you mean!
I know!
I know now!
They cut my leg off.
Why didn't they tell me?
Why-- Why didn't they tell me?
- Franz! Franz!
- Now I can't walk any more!
You must be thankful that you've come off with only that.
I wanted to be a forester once.
You can yet. They make artificial legs that are wonderful.
And you're through too.
You can go home. Think of that.
We brought your things for you. See?
Put 'em under the bed.
That's a marvellous pair of boots.
Look at that leather!
What comfort.
I was just thinking.
If you're not going to be using these,
Franz, why don't you leave 'em with us?
What good are they to you?
I can use 'em.
My boots give me blister after blister--
Well, we'll be going, Franz.
Oh, don't go.
Stay just a little while longer.
- I'll come right back.
- We'll be coming soon again, Franz.
- I know you'll be feeling better.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Goodbye, Franz.

- I don't think--
- Done for.
[ Paul ] Boys, you go along.
I'll see you later.
[ Soldiers ]
Goodbye. All right, Paul.
I'm sorry, Paul.
I wouldn't touch a thing of his if he could use it.
I'd go barefoot over barbed wire for him if it'd do him any good.
Only-- Only why should some orderly get those boots?
I understand, Mueller.
We're all alike out here.
And good boots are scarce.
Tell the doctor to come, please.
Doctor, the man in the next bed would like to see you, sir.
I've done everything I can for him.
There's no helping him.
Poor little fella.
He says next time, Franz.
Do you think
I'll ever get well?
Why, of course.
- Do you really think so?
- Sure, once you get over the operation.
I don't think so.
Franz! Don't talk nonsense.
Why, you'll be as good as new.
They fix up worse things than that.
Perhaps you'll go to the convalescent home... in Klosterberg among the villagers.
Then you can look out of the windows, across the fields... to the two trees on the horizon.
The loveliest time of the year now when the corn ripens.
You can go out without asking anyone.
You can even play piano if you want to.
Oh-- Oh, but, Franz, you must try to sleep now.

- I've amputated a dozen legs today.
- Bed 26, sir.
- You see to it.

- Interesting, isn't it?
- What do you wanna learn that stuff for?

- I get a lot of fun out of it.
- Aah!
My boots!
Mueller.
I saw him die.
I didn't know what it was like to die before.
And then-- then I came outside... and it felt-- it felt so good to be alive that I started in to walk fast.
I began to think of the strangest things... like being out in the fields.
Things like that.
You know-- girls.
And it felt as if there were... something electric running from the ground up through me.
And I started.
I began to run hard.
I passed soldiers and I heard voices calling to me.
I ran and I ran.
I felt as if I couldn't breathe enough air into me.
And--
And now I'm hungry.
I don't mind the war now. Be a pleasure to go to the front in boots like these.

It was... beautiful.
I have a big orchard with cherry trees at home.
When they're in full blossom... from the hayloft it looks like one single sheet.

- Perhaps you can get leave soon.
- You may even be sent back as a farmer.
A woman can't run a farm alone.

What's the matter with him?
Got a letter yesterday from his wife.
He wants to get back to his farm.
We'd all like to get back home.
I wonder what we'd do if it were suddenly peacetime again?

I'd go looking for a Cinderella... that could wear this for a garter.
And when I'd found her, nobody'd see me for two weeks.

I oughta give you a kick in the backside for startin' all this.
It's all right for all you to talk.
You've got something to go back to: wives, children, jobs.
But what about us?
What have we got to go back to?
- School?
- Why not? You know everything already.
A man can't take all that rubbish they teach you seriously... after three years of shells and bombs.
- You can't peel that off easily.
- They never taught us anything really useful... like how to light a cigarette in the wind or make a fire out of wet wood... or bayonet a man in the belly instead of the ribs where it gets jammed.
What can happen to us afterwards?
I'll tell ya.
Take our class.

I won't die!
I'm not going to die!
I'll come back!
[ Hamacher ]
Sister Libertine, how is he?
Poor boy.
They had to amputate his leg.
Paul. Paul.
Paul.
Oh, he is... gone.
Gone.
Hello.
Welcome home, Albert!
- How do you feel, kid?
- All right.
But I've got such an awful pain.
My foot hur--
Hamacher.
Did they cut my leg off?
Of course not!
How many did you have? Two?
You still got 'em!
One, two! [ Laughs ]
Don't play the fool, Hamacher.
Tell me truthfully.
Of course not.
And you look fine.
Look. See?
- [ Gasps ] I won't be a cripple.
- Now, now.
- I won't live like that!
- Be calm.
- I'll kill myself the first chance I get!
- Albert!
- I won't live! I won't live!
- Yes, you will.
Albert! Albert!
Albert, I've come back!
I told you I'd come back.
Look, everybody! I've come back!
- [ Albert ] Paul! Paul!
- That's not where I'm going.
I live over there.
Paul, I'm so happy.
Hamacher, I've come back from the dead!
- It's most irregular.
Never happened before.
- Albert, get well quickly... so we can go home soon.
- Everything will be all right now.
- Yes, Paul.
Everything will be all right... now.
[ Bell Ringing ]
Oh! Paul! Paul!
Paul.
- What's the matter, Paul?
- Nothing.
Nothing.
Paul.
Give me your handkerchief.
- Mother?
- [ Woman ] Here I am, Paul. Here I am.
Mother's ill.
- Are you wounded?
- No, Mother. I got leave.
[ Relieved Sigh ]
[ Sobbing ]
Here I am cryin' instead of being glad.
Anna, get down the jar of blackberries.
You still like them, don't you?
Yes, Mother. I haven't had any for a long time.
We might almost have known you were coming.
- I'm making potato cakes.
- [ Mother ] Don't let them burn.
Paul... sit down... beside me.
My Paul.
My baby.
I almost forgot, Mother.
I've got some little presents for you.
Look, Mother.
Bread, sausage and rice.
- Paul, you've been starving yourself.
- Hmm-mm.
Hadn't I better go and tell Father PauI's home?
- Paul could watch the things on the stove.
- No, I'm getting up.
Oh, Paul, you're a soldier now, aren't you?
But somehow,
I don't seem to know you.
I'll take these off, Mother.
I'll get your suit. It's in the wardrobe, just where you left it.
Are you really here, Paul?
You won't--
You won't disappear, will you?
No. I'm here.
Your things are ready for you, Paul.
- I remember when you caught that one.
- Yes.
And you took it away from me, didn't you?
- [ Giggles ]
- Yes, I did.
We're behind the lines, but we know how to honour the soldier... who goes on in spite of blood and death.
Gentlemen, my son.
- Prosit.
- Prosit.
I'm glad to know you, young man,
I am glad to know you.
How are things out there?
Terrible, eh? Terrible.
But we must carry on.
After all, you do at least get decent food out there.
Naturally, it's worse here.
Naturally.
But the best for our soldiers all the time. That's our motto.
- The best for our soldiers.
- [ Murmurs Of Agreement ]
But...
[ Chuckles ]
- you must give the Frenchies a good licking!
- [ All Laughing ]
And, if you boys want to come home, eh... let me show you what you must do before you can come home.
Give us a hand there, men.
Now, then, there's the line.
Runs so, in a "V".
Here is St Quentin.
You can see for yourself.
You're almost through now.
All right?
Shove ahead out there and don't stick to that everlasting trench warfare!
Smash through the johnnies!
And then you will have peace.
When you get in it... the war isn't the way it looks back here.
Oh! You don't know anything about it.
Of course, you know about the details... but this relates to the whole!
You can't judge that.
Of course, you do your duty and you risk your life.
But for that, you receive the highest honour.
I said that every man in the war ought to have the lron Cross.
First, the enemy lines must be broken through in Flanders.
- On to Paris! Push on to Paris!
- Right.
No, not in Flanders. I'll tell you just where the break should come.
- Here.
- The enemy has too many reserves there.
- I insist upon Flanders!
- Why should they do that... when they're halfway through St Quentin already?
Because Flanders is a flat country!
- No mountains, no obstructions!
- There's too many rivers there!
[ Professor ]
From the farms they have gone;
from the schools,
from the factories.
They have gone bravely,
nobly, ever forward... realizing there is no other duty now but to save the fatherland.
Paul!
How are you, Paul?
Glad to see you, Professor.
You've come at the right moment,
Baumer! Just at the right moment.
And as if to prove all I have said, here is one of the first to go.
A lad who sat before me on these very benches... who gave up all to serve in the first year of the war; one of the iron youth who have made Germany invincible in the field.
Look at him-- sturdy and bronze and clear-eyed.
The kind of soldier
every one of you should envy.
Oh, lad, you must speak to them.
You must tell them what it means to serve your fatherland.
- No, I can't tell them anything.
- You must, Paul.
Just a word.Just tell them how much they're needed out there.
Tell them why you went and what it meant to you.
I can't say anything.
You can remember some deed of heroism, some touch of nobility.
- Tell about it.
- [ Enthusiastic Chattering ]
I can't tell you anything you don't know.
We live in the trenches out there. We fight.
We try not to be killed; sometimes we are.
That's all.
[ Professor ]
No. No, Paul.
I've been there!
I know what it's like.
That's not what one dwells on, Paul.
I heard you in here reciting that same old stuff... making more iron men, more young heroes.
You still think it's beautiful and sweet to die for your country, don't you?
We used to think you knew.
The first bombardment taught us better.
It's dirty and painful to die for your country.
When it comes to dying for your country, it's better not to die at all!
There are millions out there dying for their countries, and what good is it?
- [ All Chattering ]
- [ Professor ] Paul!
You asked me to tell them how much they're needed out there.
He tells you, "Go out and die."
Oh, but if you'll pardon me, it's easier to say "Go out and die" than it is to do it.
- [ Boy ] Coward!
- And it's easier to say it than to watch it happen.
- [ Angry Clamouring ]
- [ Professor ] No! No! Boys, boys!
- I'm sorry, Baumer, but I must say--
- It's no use talking like this.
You won't know what I mean.
Only, it's been a long while since we enlisted out of this classroom.
So long I thought maybe the whole world had learned by this time.
Only now they're sending babies, and they won't last a week!
I shouldn't have come on leave.
Up at the front you're alive or you're dead, and that's all!
You can't fool anybody about that very long.
Up there we know we're lost and done for whether we're dead or alive.
Three years we've had of it-- four years.
Every day a year and every night a century.
Our bodies are earth and our thoughts are clay... and we sleep and eat with death.
We're done for because you can't live that way and keep anything inside you!
I shouldn't have come on leave.
I'll go back tomorrow.
I've got four days more, but I can't stand it here! I'll go back tomorrow!
Sorry.
Mother, you'll catch cold here.
You must go to sleep.
There'll be plenty of time to sleep... when you're gone.
Must you go tomorrow, Paul?
Must you?
Yes, Mother.
Orders were changed.
Are you very much afraid, Paul?
No, Mother.
There's something I want to say to you, Paul.
It's--
Just be on your guard against the women out there.
They're no good.
Where we are, there aren't any women, Mother.
Be very careful at the front, Paul.
Yes, Mother, I will.
I'll pray for you every day.
And if you could, get a job that's not quite so dangerous.
Yes, Mother.
I'll try and get in the cookhouse.
- That can easily be done.
- You do it then, and if the others say anything--
That won't worry me, Mother.
Now, you must go to bed and you must get well quickly before I come back.
I put two sets of underwear-- new ones-- in your pack.
They'll keep you nice and warm.
[ Choking ]
They're all wool.
That's sweet of you.
Goodnight... my son.
Goodnight, Mother.
Oh, Mother, Mother.
You still think I'm a child.
Why can't I put my head in your lap and cry?
- Is this the 2nd Company?
- Yes, sir.
♪ [ Concertina ]
♪ [ Whistling ]
- Is this all of it?
- Yes, sir.
We had 150 men, but this is all that came back yesterday.
But now they're going to give us enough to make 150 again.
How old are you?
Sixteen.
No use.
I couldn't find anything.
- We'll have to eat the sawdust.
- [ Discontented Grumbles ]
Not me! I'll go hungry first.
It makes me sick.
Now it's gonna be a real war again.
Paul!
How's old Paul?
Here I am.
You know, the 2nd Company's getting hard to find.
Nobody seemed to know where you were.
I'm glad you found it.
I guess I don't get much of this.
There used to be some food in the sawdust. Now it's all sawdust.
No joke, either.
Eats ya up inside.
This doesn't look much like the old 2nd Company.
The replacements are all like that.
Not even old enough to carry a pack.
All they know how to do is die.
I guess... some of the old-timers are here yet.
Paul, they're tryin' to invent somethin' to kill me right now.
Where's Westhus?
Messenger dog was wounded.
He went out to get it. [ Clucks Tongue ]
- Is it true about the armistice?
- Doesn't look that way back there.
- You mean they want us to go on fighting?
- That's what they say.
They're crazy!
Germany'll be empty pretty soon.
Where is--
Where is Detering?
He got homesick. You remember about the cherry blossoms?
I guess he never got over that.
He started out one night to go home and help his wife with the farm.
They got him behind the lines, and we never heard of him since.
He was just homesick, but probably they couldn't see it that way.
- Where's Kat? Is he--
- [ Chuckles ]
Not Kat! If he were out, the war would be over.
You remember what he always says:
They're savin' him for the last.
- Where is he?
- He's out lookin' for food, something to make soup with.
- Which way?
- Down the road about two miles that way.
I'll see you later.
Kat!
Paul!
Hello, Paul.
- How's the side?
- Oh, it's all right now. It's fine.
- Have any luck?
- No, the general's staff's been over this country with a rake.
[ Chuckles ]
Let's sit down there.
Tell me, Paul... how was it at home?
Have a good leave?
- In spots.
- What's the matter?
Ohh... I'm no good for back there any more, Kat.
None of us are.
We've been in this too long.
The young men thought I was a coward because I told them that... we learn that death is stronger than duty to one's country.
The old men said,
"Go on. Push on to Paris."
My father even wanted me to wear my uniform around him.
[ Laughing ]
It's not home back there any more.
All I could think of was, "I'd like to get back and see Kat again."
You're all I've got left, Kat.
I'm not much to have left.
I missed you, Paul.
At least we know what it's all about out here. There're no lies here.
Push on to Paris?
You ought to see what they've got on the other side.
They eat white bread over there.
They've got dozens of aeroplanes to our one... and tanks that'll go over anything.
What've we got left?
Guns so worn they drop shells on our own men.
No food, no ammunition, no officers.
Push on to Paris!
So that's the way they talk back there. [ Chuckles ]
I guess we'd better be going.
How I lied to my poor mother.
I told her it wasn't so bad out here because there was always a lot of us together.
Now that I'm with you, I'm beginning to believe that I told her the truth.
Down!
That's another one that missed us.
Come on. Let's go.
Wait a minute. Looks like the old bread wagon's broke down.
- I guess I don't walk the rest of the way.
- Did that get ya, Kat?
Aah, I think it broke my shin.
That's not so bad.
Hold it together.
-Just my luck, huh?
- Good luck. That means the war is over.
Oh, no, sir!
This war don't end till they really get me.
- [ Chuckles ]
- Now this one--
- Aah.
- Easy, now.
- Hey!
- Easy!
Easy!
Come on. I'll take you in.
Give me your hand.
Easy.
[ Grunts ]
All right.
Well, kid... now we're gonna be separated.
Maybe we can do something together later on when the war is over.
- Yes, kid.
- You give me your address,
I'll give you mine.
[ Explosion ]
[ Debris Clattering ]
You can't get both of us in one day.
Ah, we'll surely
see each other again, Kat.
Remember that day when you brought the whole pig into the factory?
And that day in the woods when you taught us how to dodge shells?
And my first bombardment.
How I cried.
I was a young recruit then.
Here we are.
Here we are.
[ Grunts ]
All right now, Kat.
You could've spared yourself the trouble. He's dead.
Oh, no. He's just fainted.
He was hit in the shin.
He's dead.
Would you like to take his pay book?
- You're not related, are you?
- No, we're not related.
Your deal.
Get his name and number?
Yeah, Corporal
Stanislaus Katczinsky, 306.
[ Muttering, Indistinct ]
-♪ [ Harmonica ]
- [ Distant Explosions ]
[ Gunshot ]
Here comes Leicester.
Should I try?
- My Lord Leicester...
- Later.
Let me introduce my friend,
Hillary Vane.
Later.
Later, my Lord, may be too late.
Miss Cynthia, what have you lost?
A pearl from the Queen's. dress
- Not here.
- I heard the Queen owns 3,000 dresses.
Yes, sir, but she wants to wear the dress with pearls.
I say again, my lord Treasurer, that we neglect the Queen's safety.
There are plotters abroad.
Even now, as I came down the gallery,
I saw faces better viewed behind prisons's bars.
Keep the sprat and catch the whale.
Your pardon, Grandfather.
Your pardon, my Lord.
Me and the Earl of Leicester are in private converse, Cynthia.
What is the matter?
The Queen is furious because the Spanish ambassador is kept waiting, and there she stands in her petticoat and will only wear the French dress.
Well why not let her wear the French dress, mistress Cynthia?
A pearl is lost from the back.
From the back?
Well, she won't miss it.
No, my Lord, she has eyes in the back of her head.
Here... take this, Cynthia.
Everybody should always come to you come first!
I wish everybody thought so.
If Drake had thought of coming to you first, should we be rejoicing at the good news?
You can not mean
Drake's raid on Cadiz.
I do mean Drake's raid on Cadiz.
My Lord Leicester, see, here lies England.
But half an island.
Not 300 miles long, not 200 miles broad.
How small we are.
How wretched and defenseless.
Now turn to Spain.
In the Old World and the New.
In the Old... power.
In the New, gold.
Philip could build ten such fleets as Drake burned... and never feel the difference.
But if Spain sails across the sea to us, and burns our shipping...
How should we make it good?
You are the Lord Treasurer of England.
And that treasure is empty.
My Lords, the Queen's entering the throne room.
- My Lord, I lean only on my friends.
- The lean on!
Your Majesty breaks faith with Spain.
Ambassador, you forget yourself!
My Lord Leicester, it is you who forget yourself... the Spanish Ambassador is our guest.
Your Grace, we speak for England.
Indeed Your Grace, we do.
Who dares to speak for
England in my presence?
Answer my Lord Leicester, did you?
And you, my wise Burleigh, did you?
Be silent while then as I speak for you all.
For I am, England.
And I am the voice of Spain.
Continue, voice of Spain.
My master, His Majesty King Philip...
He introduces me to my own brother in law.
Reassure your master.
My sister Mary, the late Queen, was his loving wife and for her sake
I am his loving sister.
His portrait is still hanging on a place of honor.
My King doesn’t ask Your Grace to hang his picture.
But to hang his enemies.
Just this month, English pirates have destroyed some 7,000 tons of our shipping.
Names?
What do I know of their names?
They come and go like wasps... led always by the arch-pirate "El Draco".
Sir Francis Drake sailed around the world and I knighted him for it.
Now he's haunting Spain, and I am to hang him for it!
No.
If I hang Drake, tomorrow twenty other Drakes will take his place.
How can I hold them back when your King sends my honest merchants to the Inquisition to be burned alive?
Your Grace can at least forbid them to leave England.
England is a large island very many ports.
I will not sit at each and wait like a cat at the mouse hole
But I could spend free leave to punish my Drake and his captains... if Spain can.
Majesty!
I say, my Lord, "If Spain can."
If Your Majesty will not hear words, we must come to cannons!
And see if you will hear them.
If you use threats of that kind
I will kick you out of my kingdom.
But Your Grace, you must listen.
"Must"?
Little man, little man...
"Must" is not a word to use to princes.
Our Council shall confer with you.
Meanwhile, go home and be quiet.
Leicester.
- I have been too bold.
- It was needed.
If once the Spaniards think that we are afraid...
Invasion.
Night and day it drums in my ear, invasion, invasion, invasion.
I'm afraid.
So that is why you disavowed Drake.
Disavow you call it?
That gentleman cares not if
I should disavow him.
It is a private agreement that we have.
I was not told.
Must I tell you everything, jealous Robin?
When we were children I served you.
When the Queen your sister sent you to the tower...
But he is Philip of Spain...
Still I served you and was trusted.
But today, though I serve...
And love...
I am not trusted!
Do not deceive yourself.
I know you love me and will risk your life for me.
But these men risk more than their mere life.
Once they're caught...
I can not help them and they know it.
Once they're caught, it is death by fire.
But that does not stop them from dying for me.
They still cry...
God save the Queen!
Death to the King of Spain, brave boys!
Come on you there, die for the King!
Come on!
Come on!
Richard Ingolby.
Richard!
Miguel!
Father, he knows you!
We were friends once.
Enemies now!
I wish we had never met.
Why, sir?
Because you've beaten us?
But as long as we're your prisoners, sir, it's a sort of holiday.
That's right, dear lad.
We're safe enough.
Miguel... is it not possible to spare the boy?
I can do nothing.
It's each for himself, sink or swim.
Richard, you hear me?
Sink or... swim.
Michael.
You are the Queen's servant.
Yes, of course.
I'm now going to give you her orders.
You climb up on the rail.., dive... swim for shore.
When you are on land, make for the home of Don Miguel, he will help if he can.
Leave you here?
I had rather die.
I have friends in Spain.
I'm safe enough.
Once you're in England, go to the Queen.
I will not leave!
Obey me, Michael.
In the name of the Inquisition.
Father!
- Dona Elena!
- Father came!
But you can not go downstairs in your night gear.
She's mad!
Ah, poor child, she had an English nurse and she's never got over it.
A mannerless woman who opened all the windows.
Dad!
Elena!
They said you'd never get ashore tonight!
Admiral.
Doña Elena, you must come back to your room at once.
Please tell the servants to prepare a meal for me.
First Doña Elena must retire!
I am not going back to bed yet.
What did I hear you say?
I am not going back to bed yet.
I want to hear about the fight!
Let her remain, Señora.
If you say so, Admiral, you are her father.
But for the future, Señorita, remember this:
A Spanish lady may retire, but she never goes to bed.
Listen to me, Elena.
You're not a child anymore.
A child?
When I'm going to be married in three months?
The captain of the
English vessel, is Richard Ingolby.
Your friend... long ago... in England.
A friend... from long ago...
My best friend.
And I've handed him over to the military authorities... and they will hand him over to the Inquisition.
And you know what that will mean.
Father...
But he has an only son, Elena.
I've reported him drowned.
But I do not think that he is drowned.
I think that he will reach the shore and come to us for help.
What is he like?
Fair or dark?
He could pass for a Spaniard.
And he speaks Spanish.
So if he does come...
But we mustn't help a heretic!
Besides, father, the danger!
But nobody will know!
But they will!
I can give work to a beggar if I choose.
He's only a boy, Elena.
But an enemy of Spain!
What is it?
There's somebody outside.
Is this the English heretic?
Elena!
Poor boy!
The Queen sent me to have you this...
Why does she always call you
"spirit," grandfather?
Continue!
A letter from her desk, a cordial from her cupboard, and a message from her heart.
Repeat the message.
She says: "I entreat Heaven daily for your longer life... else would I and my people stand in need of cordial all."
She is my cordial.
Vinegar for the rest of us.
She gave me a cuff this morning.
No doubt you earned it!
I was only humming a tune!
Michael's tune.
But she ordered me off to you with those letters and I was not to come back until you'd read them.
"Will you hear of a Spanish Lady...
"how she wooed an Englishman...
"Garments gay, rich as may be she had on...
"comely was her countenance...
Oh, gad... does your gout trouble you so?
Sir Richard Ingolby has been captured by the Spaniards.
He is held by the Inquisition.
And Michael?
There's no word here of Michael.
"Will you hear of a Spanish Lady...
"how she wooed an Englishman...
I said you could not do it.
Now, listen.
"Will you hear of a Spanish Lady...
"how she wooed an Englishman...
"garments gay, rich as may be she had on...
"comely was her countenance...
"high was her degree...
"smiling...
"sighing...
"full of grace was she.
"Will you hear a Spanish Lady...
"how she wooed an Englishman...
How I came to a Spanish Lady...
"loved an English man.
- Why do you want a fire?
- I'm cooking.
What?
A treat for you.
What is it?
They call it... a potato.
It's a kind of food, very rare.
Is that safe to eat?
Father has eaten one.
He says he never felt better in his life.
You bake them.
It takes an hour.
I'm glad it takes an hour.
I never see you nowadays.
Well, I'm very busy.
You forget I'm going to be married.
Besides... you only think of getting home to your Cynthia.
I expect she's married by now.
She won't be.
How do you know?
I know.
What are you staring at?
It's over Lisbon.
What?
Smoke, look!
So thick you can hardly see the roofs.
It's just smoke.
Michael.
Your shoulder has healed at last, eh?
Yes, thank to you, sir.
Thank to Elena.
I gave you the hurt, she mended it.
Michael, I'm to hurt you again.
But this wound will not heal so quickly.
Sir?
I have a message from your father.
At last!
Where is he?
Where is he?
His last words to me were:
"It isn't our quarrel... it isn't the Queen's quarrel.
"It's a war of ideas.
The boy will understand that one day.
"Tell him...
You can't burn ideas".
But when did he say that to you?
On my ship, the night you escaped.
Then you have not seen him since?
I saw him today.
What did he say to you?
He was gagged.
What?
Did you not see the smoke, Michael, blow in from Lisbon market place?
Smoke...
An execution.
My poor boy...
Get away from me!
- You Spanish devils!
- Michael!
And you knew too!
You let me talk and laugh...
- while my father...
- Michael!
Get away from me!
If only you knew how I loathe you all!
Your Spanish faces, your Spanish voices...
And you fed me, haven't you?
And you clothed me!
You made me your household pet, but you burned my father!
And I have to be grateful to you!
Grateful!
Michael, how dare you!
You couldn't know, for you were sick...
And now for once I know it!
I'm going now to take all my father's place!
But I haven't finished his message!
He said: "My son will hardly forgive me for deceiving him."
"He'll never forgive you."
"When his first grief is over, tell him...
I can not bear anymore!
Leave him alone.
It's all you can do for him.
We now come to the scandalous business of Drake's latest capture.
Scandalous?
I talked to the Spanish Ambassador... and I confess he may well complain.
When the Spaniards took the New World, they sent home the San Philip... the San Philip, my Lords, is the greatest treasure ship the Old World ever saw...
Drake captures... ship and treasure... and tows all home to Plymouth.
Scandalous indeed!
And now I have to report that the San
Philip has fetched in the open market...
114,000 pounds...
Of which the Crown takes forty thousand...
Fifty!
Write down fifty thousand.
Your Majesty intends to accept this money?
It should be more!
Well... so long as the crew gets it's share... fif... sixty thousand.
Your Majesty then returns the money to Spain!
Return?
We are not yet at war with Spain... but we shall be if we do not return this plunder.
If Drake had not seized the San Philip... the Armada would have sailed by now.
But it has not sailed, my lord... and we are at peace with Spain.
Either we disown the capture of the San Philip or...
Or?
Your Majesty returns the money... and hangs the good Sir Francis.
Her Grace shall not so humble herself.
My Lords, let us face facts.
Why is the Armada being built?
To invade England!
But If we strike now...
Ay, strike or be struck!
- If we strike first...
- We can not strike.
We have no brigs.
Burleigh, you croak like an old raven.
You and I have kept the peace thirty years.
Do not pleases you to croak war?
A young raven, new loose from the Spanish ark.
Well, young raven...
My, if they have not trimmed your feathers!
He has sailed from
Lisbon, Your Grace, in fishing boat, single handed.
What is your name?
Michael Ingolby.
Where is my ship and where is your father?
Both lost, Your Grace.
How lost?
By fire.
Boy... your father was ever ready to love me and serve me.
I'm in grief for your loss...
And for mine.
Gentlemen, give us leave for a little.
Come.
Father explained, they heard souls as we heard cattle.
All men must be of one pattern and one blood.
Spain is the prison of all freedom.
Spain is horror!
- Spain is...
- Shhh!
But who will listen if you do not?
You are the world's hope, my father said so.
His last word to me was: "Tell the Queen...
"Tell the Queen, Michael...
How can I?
I thought I could once in Spain...
I thought if I had but the chance...
But home again...
I can not.
How you can you, Queen here in free England... understand the danger.
Tell me, Michael, how big is their Armada?
I could never learn the numbers.
How many troops?
No one knows.
Their Armada will consists of 132 ships... it will carry 20,000 sailors, besides guns.
Your Grace has made a fool of me.
Blame nature lad, not me.
Will Your Grace give me leave to go?
If you can not endure to be laughed at, boy, how shall you endure a harder service?
Do you no longer wish to serve me?
Tell me how.
For the first change your cloth.
It stinks of fish!
Thus we learn.
Michael!
Michael.
- Sweetheart!
- My dear!
My darling!
Mistress!
This is my palace, not your private parlor.
Lord Leicester's dines with me.
Change my dress and my clothes now!
I'll come back!
The wrong shoe!
Thee wrong foot.
Where're your thoughts, girl?
In my head, Madam.
Crooked answers, crooked answers!
Yes, Madam.
For crooked questions.
My wig.
Your Grace!
Do you like what you see in the glass?
Ay, Madam.
How old are you?
Eighteen.
When I was eighteen,
I was a prisoner in the Tower.
Fetch me the Earl of Leicester.
And do not loiter!
This mirror is old and blemished!
- Shall I fetch another, Your Grace?
- No, I know what you think.
- I think nothing, Madam.
- You do, you do!
You know that the Queen’s face is blemished, not the mirror.
Well, fetch me my disguise.
I had forgotten.
Me?
That you were so beautiful.
I too had forgotten.
Me?
That you were so tall.
Such hollow cheeks... so... swarthy.
Spain is a land of ghosts.
This is home.
Home, Michael.
Who gave the wench leave to mount my throne?
And where is the Earl of Leicester?
- Madam, I forgot!
- Forgot?
The state waits while a flaunting flibbertigibbet sits in the Queen's seat and lets an insolent boy flatter her?
Am I to wait your leisure?
Your Grace, the loved Lord knows whether I'm on my head or my heels.
You do not know?
Your Grace, it was all my doing.
- Do not cry, Cynthia.
- Leave her all alone!
I'll teach you two to know me better.
You kept me waiting on your pleasure, and now you shall wait upon mine, go!
- Your Grace...
- Go and be hanged!
Your dear Majesty has frightened two bairns out of their little wits.
The girl is a minx.
But the youth...
He is such a tall lad... as you were, Robin... when all the world was young.
My dear...
Nay my lord, springtime is over.
What is your autumn wish?
Your signature.
You had less tame wishes once.
They were never granted.
And now only wish for my 60,000 pounds to spend on Burleigh's fleet.
Sign those, dear Majesty... and you are safe against Spain.
See here, Robin...
I have written out for me another paper returning the money to Philip.
Without consulting the Council?
The Council!
But the boy's talk shook me.
He is a handsome youth.
You do well to be jealous!
He's stronger than you.
You are... today.
He is tomorrow.
Lord Amberley, writes that you wish for a license to travel.
Why?
To see the world, my Lord.
What part of the world?
Paris, Rome...
Madrid?
Why should I go to Madrid?
Shall I tell you?
I should be glad to hear!
To give the King of Spain news of his English friends.
Why, Mr. Vane, you have no color in your face.
Have you been ill?
That's why my doctor recommends travel.
Mr. Vane, that is not the reason.
We know because we have read them, this letters passed between you and certain Spaniards.
There was no harm!
Why should the King of Spain invite you to Madrid?
Tell me why, and I will myself beg the
Queen to grant your license.
The Queen would be merciful to a men who confesses his follies... and those of his friends.
Come, be open with me.
I will not cheat you.
I have nothing to confess.
I do not understand your Lordship.
Your application will be considered.
Goodbye, Mr. Vane.
Good day, my lord.
Did you know that gentleman?
- Mr. Vane?
- Mr. Hillary Vane.
It is very likely he will try to leave the country.
Your business is to prevent him.
By force?
If need be.
But at all costs, he is to be taken alive.
The French ambassador has arrived, my Lord.
Has the Queen returned from hunting?
Not yet.
It's late!
Has she read my petition to rejoin the fleet?
Do you think she will let me go?
Why not?
Because he likes you.
Did you speak for me?
I didn’t dare.
She's still upset with me.
Why?
Because she likes you.
Michael!
You?
At least you've learned not to loiter.
Fools, can't you see that it's a woman?
Who set you on to killing me?
Which Queen are you?
There is but one Queen, woman.
There were once two cousins.
The Queen of England and the Queen of Scots.
The English Queen put my
Queen of Scots to death.
Now I have no Queen to serve.
She's crazy, else she would not dare.
Give me the pistol.
Not loaded.
Let her go.
The will stone me!
Where are your friends?
In France.
You shall be given safe-conducts and money to take you there.
Take her in your charge.
Be content.
No harm has come to me.
Your arm.
Alive... unhurt... oh most dear!
Let me sit down.
Lord Robin...
It was a sin to take life of kind Mary of Scotland.
Not sin of yours, her life was forfeit.
I could have saved her, but I let her perish.
Well, I pay for it.
Five times, Robin, I have stood to be shot dead.
Yet still I live.
Thank God Your Majesty is safe.
Your gout, I will not have you kneel.
We use you not for your bad leg, but with your good head.
A chair!
The King of France will rejoice at Your Grace's most happy escape.
My Master also will rejoice that your gracious life was not in danger.
- Not he in danger?
- The pistol was not loaded.
But Your Grace's alarm is natural.
A woman's fear...
Four years ago the noble Prince of Orange was shot dead on his own doorstep.
And I...
I know of loaded pistols.
And so, Your Grace', does he!
- Your Majesty!
- Boy, be silent!
Your Grace, this Spaniard plots against you.
- Slander!
- Slander? Then your own people slander you.
In Spain it is common talk that
England is full of traitors whom you have sworn to service.
- What service?
- Why, to kill the Queen!
Names?
How could I learn names?
But one day Your Grace, the pistol will be loaded.
And as the shot echoes across the sea to Spain, the Armada will sail!
And then there will be fire over England.
Flames, torments!
- He's beside himself.
- I'm not!
Then you are a fool and a hothead.
Avoid my presence!
Enough, Burleigh.
You must forgive him, your Excellency.
His father's ashes have blown into his eyes and blinded him.
You had better get away as soon as you can.
Mr. Vane, you're under arrest.
You'll not take me alive!
Well, what are you going to do?
Why should I tell you?
So that you can prevent me?
I would rather help you.
Ah, the old lads telling us what to do!
I am very tired.
In a few years, I shall be asleep forever.
Why should I care what you young people do?
Then why do you swat and hamper us?
I am an upper servant in an old house.
So is the Queen.
So is Leicester.
We have spent our lives... dusting. polishing.
Dull work.
But we have learned to take a pride in the house.
And our task in our old age is to train the new servants.
The house boys... the kitchen maids... that one day will take our places.
I wonder why we do it.
We get no thanks.
- My Lord, I did not intend...
- I can not teach you to be a hero.
I'm only a servant myself.
And service is too tame for you.
Pity.
- My lord...
- Oh, go away.
- My lord...
- Oh, chatter somewhere else.
Grandfather, the Queen is asking for you!
You are to come quickly, and quicker still.
Will you take my arm, sir?
I can still totter.
There, grandchild, is the man who requires your support.
You gave orders!
You gave orders!
You get who should be taken and who'll go free!
By gad, my Lord, if you think you rule here, you will soon know better.
Burleigh...
Vane is dead!
Dead? How?
Killed in resisting arrest.
But I gave orders...
My orders were that he should not be touched!
But this fool takes it upon him to overrule my orders!
Do you not understand, my Lord, that we wished Vane visit to Philip?
And when he would return stuffed with Philip's plots, then... then we should have taken him?
Well, I was afraid foe her life, I...
Oh, I'm assured of your dutiful thoughts!
Did they get Vane's papers?
No, he leapt over the boat's side and the tide swept him away.
Waste, waste, waste.
Wherein have I failed?
Robin... do you think that dammed fellow was indeed a traitor?
I know it!
I know a youngster who is not traitor.
You don't understand.
I understand very well!
Your loyalty asks to pay for everyone's mistakes.
But I won't let you.
If the Queen sends you home in disgrace
I'll come with you and be disgraced too.
Dear... and foolish.
Why foolish?
You love me, don't you?
Well... settled?
I can't.
Michael!
I can't!
We have a right to be happy!
Everyone's the right to be happy, Michael!
Everyone, yes.
That is why we can't. be.
The last time I watched a fire fall to pieces was the day my father...
Elena and I were laughing.
And then the smoke began to drift across the bay.
Michael.
Michael!
Yes, dear, of course, we a right to be happy.
Husband and wife sitting by the fire listening to the crackles... and thinking of what they did to him.
I shall make you forget it.
I shall!
The smoke drifted right over us.
And now it's drifting over England.
Unless we stop it.
Oh, Cynthia, help me to stop it.
I'll help you.
How?
Come away, Michael.
She would like you to come away Michael, to your home and herd.
And I do not blame her for dreaming.
But it is not service.
What is service?
First obedience.
I will obey you.
Then, Michael, give me what I want.
I will give Your Majesty my life.
Would you?
Would you give me your silly young life?
Dear lad.
Then I will tell you some news.
Vane, who was on his treacherous way to Philip's court, is dead.
But it is known to none.
He was of your height, not much older...
And I speak Spanish.
Well?
Could you take Vane's part?
This is madness!
Why should he risk his life, twice?
Dear, be quiet.
No let her speak, you love her.
It is fit that you should ask her leave.
I love her... but I will not ask any girl's leave to do what I must.
Not if I order it?
Michael!
Michael, speak to me out of your own heart not because she bid you,
Must you go?
If you are killed, Michael, there will be so many years without you.
I shall grow old... fifty years without you, Michael, think of it!
Fifty springs, summers, winters.
Must you go?
Then you go with my free leave.
Lord Burleigh will order your journey.
Luck go with you!
I have no more to say to you till you return.
Girl...
- Your Grace?
- Where do you go?
I'll do but seek some... merciful corner to cry in.
Cry here.
The money... and the licence to travel.
The license not granted to Hillary Vane.
He was on his way to Philip when he died.
And took his secrets with him.
- Secrets?
- The names.
We know the plot against the Queen but do not the plotters' names.
And Philip knows them.
None but Philip.
- I'll get those names.
- How?
I do not know, my Lords.
But I know that if I do not get those names for you,
I will never see England again.
Make up the fire.
This hottest of days?
I'm always cold.
A cordial, Sire?
No wine warms.
How many letters have I answered?
Your Majesty has this morning written 40 letters by your own hand and dictated nine dispatches.
I will continue.
Sire, is it not time to rest?
Not in this world.
Who remains to be seen?
Admiral Valdez, newly arrived from Lisbon, he awaits instructions concerning the Armada.
- Who else?
- Mr. Vane, from England.
Admit the Admiral.
Employ rigorous miens.
Only by fear can the people be made to...
Admiral, I am satisfied with your report.
And the Armada sails?
A month from this day.
If the Englishman confirms our hopes.
Admit Mr. Vane.
Continue.
Only by fear can the people be made to do their duty.
And not always then.
Your Majesty... on behalf of all your devoted adherents in England
I... I...
Compose yourself.
You are welcome to Spain.
Get up and deliver me your letters.
I am the letter, Sire.
We dare not commit our plans to paper.
- But Lord Amberley says here...
- Ah, ah, but...
Mr. Vane, you must not interrupt His Majesty.
Let him go on,
I know the English.
I only wish to say, Sir... that my Lord Amberley wrote... before the attempt on the Queen's life.
What?
It was not attempted by ours.
- A poor lunatic...
- Is the Queen hurt?
Untouched.
But there is now such watchfulness at court... that we all, and my Lord Amberley in particular... favour a delay.
More delays?
Only until the Armada reaches the Channel.
In the confusion the Queen should be easier to attack.
Wait.
Now, sir, the plan.
Sir, in the audience chamber at Greenwich...
I remember that audience chamber.
Always draughty when the wind was in the East.
Yes, Sir... because, sir, behind the tapestry there is a passage... walled up since the old King's days...
But some of us have secretly taken down the brickwork...
Some of you?
How many of you attend the Queen?
My Lord Amberley, always, and... and myself until a month ago.
Does Sir Humphrey Cooper attend?
Sir Humphrey's absence hardly affects the situation, Sir.
What is the plan?
Why, to spirit the Queen's out of the palace by way of the passage.
Where would you take her?
To Sir Humphrey Cooper's.
Surely he lives in the North!
Ay, but he has an empty house in the Essex's marshes.
The Essex's marshes...
It would be easy to send a boat over from Holland.
I will consider your scheme.
Count...
I commit Mr. Vane to your charge.
Accompany him to the Governor's apartments.
And see to it that his stay with us is a pleasant one.
Your Majesty,
I most humbly thank...
Compose yourself.
Well, Admiral?
I do not understand this blunt Englishman.
I lived a year with Englishmen.
I hated everyone of them.
And how it rained!
But we must use the tools that Providence sends us, Admiral.
Blunt though they be.
It is a good scheme, my Sire.
Yes... it is a good scheme... if he is honest.
Your first visit to Spain?
And my first view of the Escorial.
Very impressive.
But I shall inevitably loose my way in all these bewildering galleries and corridors.
In that case, always ask to be sent to prison.
- To prison?
- Now we have alarmed him!
As governor of the palace, my official quarters are of course connected with the prison.
So you see, you must be careful, Mr. Vane.
Oh, I will.
His Majesty has already made me shake in my shoes.
- What did he say?
- Compose yourself!
Elena!
Spain and England under one King.
- Think of it!
- Oh, we do!
All England waiting for salvation.
All England watching the Channel.
- Waiting.
- That's it!
Just waiting.
Pedro!
Admiral Valdez has just come.
He's going to stay with us, he promises he will.
- My dear Admiral!
- Oh, Don Escobal!
Who is?
My dear, allow me to present His
Majesty's guest from England...
Mr. Hillary Vane.
My dear... talk to your guest from England.
I...
I have to talk to you.
You come from home.
My dear, how you do remind me of your father!
You speak of Don Miguel de Casanz, Admiral?
I didn't know that you've met my father at all, Mr. Vane.
I have heard his praises sound so often at home.
He made many friends in England.
It is hard for me to remember that now.
Have I...?
My father in law was killed two months ago.
Killed, by English pirates.
I'm deeply distressed to hear this.
Are you?
Why?
You are English.
Elena!
I know no full of vanity than this... to kiss and hate... to kiss and love...
To kiss.
Charming!
Charming! Charming!
Charming.
Then you approve of our
Spanish love songs?
I find them disturbing.
Ours English songs are lighter.
More heartless.
That's a challenge!
Am I to accept it?
If you dare.
Dare!
"As the holly growes green...
"And never changes that hue...
"So am I - ever have been - unto my lady true.
Pathetic show of me!
Who wrote it?
King Henry VIII.
That monster who beheaded all his wives?
How could he?
But love often turns to hate, doesn't it Countess?
I dare say, when it is rewarded by shamelessness!
What's that you are playing now?
One of our English ballads.
They call it
"The Spanish Lady's Love."
"Will you hear of a Spanish Lady...
"how she saved an Englishman...
"Garments gay, rich as may be she had on...
"comely was her countenance...
"high was her degree...
"smiling...
"sighing...
"full of grace was she.
"Will you hear of a Spanish Lady...
"how she saved an Englishman...
How I turned to a Spanish Lady...
"saved an English man.
And now let me propose a toast!
Gentlemen, I give you the loveliness of Spain.
An ingenious toast.
It's wine!
It's music!
It's women.
I had no idea Englishmen were so gallant.
A thousand apologies!
I have been with the King until this moment.
Does His Majesty ever stop working?
Stop working?
Not to my knowledge.
I shouldn't be surprised, Mr. Vane, if you found yourself on your way back to England before dawn.
I've never known His Majesty to decide a matter so quickly.
You are to be congratulated.
There are few who succeed in hurrying our prudent King.
Then let us drink. gentlemen, to your prudent King.
- The King!
- The King!
Prudence is of course a virtue that we English lack.
You put audacity in it's place?
Do you despise audacity?
It dazzled me, once... but I have since learned to admire other qualities in a man.
Such as?
Unselfishness... consideration for others... all that is implied by...
Prudence!
My friends!
Drink to the prudent, who think as the state thinks... who believes as the state believes... who loves and hates with prudence... and dies prudently... when it is no longer safe to live... and lies snug at last in prudence's grave.
Gentlefolk of Spain, I give you the prudent's face.
And may England...
You can guess my wishes, gentlemen, for England.
Yes... speak out your wishes.
Ah, yes!
Let us now drink to the success of our guest's mission.
To the end of... of heresy!
To the invincible Armada!
To the destruction of Elisabeth!
You, you do not drink?
My glass is empty.
To the salvation of England.
Did you cut your hands?
Nothing.
Elena.
No, Michael.
Elena, please.
I must tell my husband who you are.
You know I must.
The King must know.
I can't let you betray Spain.
I'm only fighting for my own people.
And I for mine.
Then why did you say nothing when we met?
You had only to say this is
Michael Ingolby, a runaway prisoner.
Why did you keep my secret?
I remembered you.
Dear...
Dearest Elena.
Why are there wars?
Why must I be torn in two?
It isn't wrong to be found of you.
Father... he was too.
Darling.
I kept your secret till
I could speak to you.
But now I must give you up to them.
Kiss me first.
No.
It's just goodbye.
The last time we forgot to say goodbye.
Goodbye...
Michael.
Somebody is coming.
It's Pedro!
Then tell him now.
What could be more prudent?
You are are cruel!
Helena.
I can enjoy my
Spanish moonlight.
So I perceived.
The moonlight in this country is best enjoyed alone.
Why have you left your guests?
Answer me!
What happened just now?
You told me to talk to him, you said I'd been rude.
Did I tell you to walk alone with him on the terrace?
There was no harm, we were just saying goodbye.
In private?
Why are you so angry?
I shall never see him again.
Again?
Where you've seen him before?
- Nowhere.
- And why did you...
You have seen him before.
What is this mystery?
Who is this man who you insult in public...
- and yet, in private, you...
- No, no, Pedro, you're wrong.
- Well?
- I had the right!
Give me the copy of Mr. Vane's instructions and the letters.
Sir James Todd...
Lord Illingworth...
Sir Humphrey Cooper...
Mr. Joseph Madison...
Lord Amberley... and, of course, Mr. Laurence Gregory.
Ah, Mr. Vane!
Mr. Vane...
You will leave for England tonight.
Your Majesty...
I have not finished.
I have written for you the necessary letters of authorization.
The ink is still wet.
Sand it for me.
Allow me!
That is the sand... that the ink.
Your pardon.
Copy the letter again.
Meanwhile, I will outline for you the modifications
I desire to make in your plan.
Having secured the Queen's person...
Your father must have been beside himself.
- An enemy here...
- He wasn't an enemy.
He was just Michael, we were fond of him.
Fond of him?
The wife of the
Governor of the Palace has failed to disclose the presence of an enemy.
Is the King to be said that she meant no harm and she was fond of him?
I hope to deserve
Your Majesty's trust.
Trust?
I do not trust you, sir.
I do not trust any man.
If the Count of Carmenar is with us, fetch him.
But you have convinced me that you believe that your welfare depends upon obeying me... and you are right!
I reward those whom I... within reason, trust.
Upon your arrival in England, you will of course immediately get in touch with...
Sir James Tallerton...
And?
My Lord Amberley...
Mr. Joseph Madison.
And?
Sir Humphrey Cooper...
Lord Illingworth.
And?
And?
Tallerton, Amberley...
Madison, Cooper...
- Illingworth...
- And?
And?
My memory.
He... he's my oldest friend!
The name is on the tip of my tongue...
No... gone!
- He will laugh when I tell him.
- And?
Tallerton, Amberley, Madison,
Cooper, Illingworth.
Tallerton, Amberley, Madison,
Cooper, Illingworth.
And Mr. Laurence Gregory.
Count, you will place this gentleman under arrest.
This way.
Your sword.
Keep your dagger.
You will need your dagger, Mr. Ingolby.
Elena who's told you?
My wife told me a piece of folly so inconceivable...
Walk on.
We may be watched.
Do you realize what will happen to my wife if she is known to have helped a heretic?
It will never be known trough to me.
You English fool, you'll be persuaded to tell everything.
We understand persuasion.
Walk on.
You force me to choose between betraying my country or my wife.
I'm obliged to help you.
The only chance is to escape now before news of your arrest are spread through the palace.
At the end of this gallery...
I'll hand you over to the captain of the guard...
Then, without scruples, use the dagger.
And be shot down for my pain.
My dear Count, that will be very convenient.
I regret the risk, you must take it!
If...
I say if, you are adroit enough to escape in the confusion... it will be to my interest to create a confusion to delay the chase.
Make to the stables.
If you could secure a horse before the alarm is given... why, then you have a... slender chance.
Captain!
You will escort this gentleman to the prison.
I shall examine him tomorrow.
Adiós, senõr.
Adiós, Count.
Captain!
At your service, Count.
If at any time the prisoner should show sign of plotting an escape, he is to be shot down.
- Understood?
- Understood.
Fire!
Fire!
Fire!
Mr. Vane!
Is the fire is serious?
They are getting it under.
I don't think we can do anything.
Are you leaving us tonight?
Yes, His Majesty has been most gracious.
I was just about to try to find my horse.
I've arranged that!
Thank you.
I have to slip away as unobtrusively as possible.
Oh, evidently, but does His Majesty...
You can trust me!
Thank you!
I'm ready,
I am very much obliged to you...
I should never have got away without your good offices.
I'm rather surprised His Majesty hasn't assigned you an escort.
I prefer to travel lightly.
Yes, one likes to be free!
Yet, sir, at the moment it is most essential to hurry.
We... we... we shall meet again in Lisbon!
Yes!
You'll do find us waiting for you!
Adiós!
A very pleasant fellow.
At long last Michael is saved... and you are not angry.
No, not angry, my dearest!
But you must grow up.
You see Elena, the whole trouble comes from treating your enemies like human beings.
Don't you see, my dear, that if you do that they cease to be enemies?
Think of what that leads to.
It's the end of patriotism.
It's the end of the war.
It's the end of... of everything!
Now, do you see?
I see.
The Armada!
The Armada!
The Armada!
The Armada!
The Armada!
Where are my spirits?
I've come to bid you goodbye.
I'm for Tilbury.
Your Grace should stay in London.
Your Grace will not take my advice?
I can't.
Nor the Council's advice?
The Council's a pack of cowards.
The army is at Tilbury and Leicester writes me... here, listen.
May it please you to come for this army and people... by spending two or three days in the camp.
So now comfort me, Burleigh,
And wish me good luck.
- Is this your supper?
- Not now, not now.
Why not now?
A good English broth.
Your Majesty's kindness.
Keep your breath to cool your porridge.
Come, one more spoonful.
Now I must go.
Take care of him, child.
Your Grace!
Your Grace is there to have no news?
Of the Armada?
Of Michael.
I have no comfort for you.
Do you think he will come back?
I'm not providence!
But what does Your Grace think?
I've seen blackest fears turn to hopes.
Hope on till you know there is none.
My people.
I have come to live or die amongst you all.
To lay down for my God, and for my kingdom... and for my people my honor and my blood, even in the dark.
I know I have the body of a weak and feeble woman...
But I have the heart and valor of a King.
And of a King of England too.
Not Spain nor any prince of Europe shall dare to invade the borders of my realm.
Wake up your hearts!
By your peace in camp and your valor in the field
Will shall shortly have a famous victory!
Who should keep my subjects from me?
Well, loiterer?
Majesty...
News from Spain,.
Come!
Mr. Gregory.
Summon to me here my Lord Amberley... my Lord Illingworth...
Sir Humphrey Cooper,
Sir James Tallerton...
Mr. Madison...
And you come back.
You have done more than well.
You can ask and have.
She knows everything, everything!
It's better if we face it out, or do we run for it?
- Run where?
- Once the Spaniards land...
You’ll be hanged by then!
You have done enough.
Not while the Spaniards are in the channel.
You said ask and have, let me join the ships.
Your Grace...
The gentlemen are waiting.
Your place is with those others, and you know it!
Go!
What is wrong here?
Robin, I need your sword.
- My sword?
- Yes.
Here in my hand.
Kneel, Michael.
Rise up.
Rise up, Sir Michael Ingolby.
Your Grace!
Your Grace.
I rise up and I cast down.
Wait here.
Words will not count.
Hear that?
She is...
She is...
She is the Queen.
The greatest joy of my lifetime has been to serve her.
And so will you find it.
You, sirs... you have plotted to kill me.
Well, here I stand.
Will you still sway your swords?
Men use them better!
But let the King of Spain call you servants, when I call you...
Sons?
Your Grace!
Ay, sons, though your lives are forfeit.
How will you die?
In sunlight or in darkness?
For a free world, or a world where your thoughts are rationed like prison food?
Choose, for the enemy is upon us.
God save the Queen!
God save the Queen!
Sir Michael Ingolby, come here!
Michael, I will give you a command.
You shall fight fire with fire.
These men shall fight under you for their souls' salvation.
Gentlemen...
Dear Michael...
If you took seven little ships and tarred them... and piled them with firewood... and so sailed them single-handed against the greatest fleet the world has ever known...
If you wield not swords in your hands, but torches!
Thou didst blow with thy wind... and they were scattered.
Peace!
Till next time.
No next time...
The Armada was scattered to the four winds.
And now the bells begin to ring.
Your Grace must rest!
No time, Robin.
For now come the rewards, and the knighting, and all the happy people.
And the blind... who will never see again.
And the maimed men... and the men with youth gone out of them.
Some men will still have youth left.
Listen to our wedding bells.
The woman's point of view!
Every steeple in England rocks for joy... and my granddaughter says...
"It's because I'm getting married"
So at last they are to marry!
I allow it.
They shall not stay at court.
I don't know married folk at my court.
Yet, I'm a married man.
Oh, fool you.
You may go.
And come again?
Come and go.
Will come and go.
Yes, it's old and tarnished.
I will have no more mirrors in any room of mine.
My loving... people.
Let us give thanks.
Almighty God...
Father of all mercy...
We, Thine unworthy servants...
We give Thee our most humble and hearty thanks!

- Hold it! Where're you going?
- The Czechs've taken the farmstead.
- The Czechs? Where's your rifle?
- Back there.
- Where's your rifle?
- Vassily Ivanovich, Comrade Commander,
I've lost it in the river when we fled the farmstead. - Find it.
And where's your machine-gun,
Pastukhov?
I've hidden it by the river, right on the bank.
Thank you for the farmstead, fighters.
As for your rifles, I'll personally check up on all of you tonight.
Fall out!
- My name's Furmanov. Appointed a commissar to your division. - I know.
That's the weavers, our volunteers.
So you're here?
Yes, we're here.
Are you a machine-gunner?
Can be a machine-gunner too. Why?
You're just in time. We've got an order from Mikhail Frunze:
Tomorrow we're assuming the offensive.
What are they doing there?
Taking a swim. It's too hot.
Quiet, folks! Chapay needs to think.
Pugachev's regiment attacks at mid- night... Razin's stays in the reserve.
So, by 9 a.m. We'll take the village of Lomikhinskaya.
- What d'ye think, Yelan? - I think a blow on the right flank is better.
And what does the Commissar think?
I think...
My opinion is...
The Commander's already taken the decision and I think it's right.
Everything you said here is to be spit on and forgotten.
Now listen to my command:
We attack on both flanks.
Cross the river only by the bridge.
It will hold. I've checked it.
We begin attacking at 5 a.m. Sharp.
And we'll go by way...
The village has been taken.
- Wounded? - I am, Vassily Ivanovich.
- Stupid.
You're the only brigade commander, my military deputy.
You have no right to expose yourself to stupid bullets.
- The bullet doesn't think who's commander and who... - It doesn't, but you must think.
Haven't you got brains?
Come here.
For example, a detachment is on the march.
Where's the commander supposed to be?
At the head, on his dashing horse.
The enemy showed up and opened cannon fire.
Where's the commander supposed to be?
He can be at the head again, because they wouldn't fire from cannons at one man.
Now the enemy opened gunfire.
Where's the commander supposed to be?
Suppose they have 10 machine-guns here, and two here. Where?
- Where The ten are.
- The ten... Can't you think?
It's easier to kill you where the ten are. So you must be where the two are.
Otherwise, without a commander, it'll be the end of his men too.
Now the enemy is attacking.
Where's the commander supposed to be?
- At the head. - He must go to the rear of his detachment and watch the whole scene of the battle from some vantage point.
Otherwise his detachment's flanks may be turned.
Now, thanks to the decisive actions of the detachment and its commander, the enemy's been beaten off and made to flee.
Our detachment is harrying the enemy that retreats in panic.
Where's the commander supposed to be?
At the head again, on his horse.
He has to be the first to burst into town on his enemy's shoulders.
Use your brains!
You're such a liar, Vassily Ivanovich.
If need be, you're always at the head.
Well, if need be.
This is called "back plate".
And this is called "cheeks".
And what's that called?
Back plate... Cheeks...
Smart guy.
- Don't you understand jokes? - You
- are all buggers. The Chapayev men...
You're heroes only with women.
Cut it out about heroes.
Wait till I sneak to the Whites and bring back a prisoner who'll talk.
I bet I will...
We have to see about a prisoner yet.
Whether you bring him or not.
You think I'm going to leave?
Forget it.
Teach me the machine-gun, you devil.
This is called "cheeks".
Cheeks! I swear it's cheeks.
On the German front, I had the honor of fighting General von Ludendorf, and here, who the hell it is?
Chapayev! They say he was a sergeant.
There's nothing to laugh at,
Lieutenant.
Chapayev is a serious adversary.
He and his fame are equally dangerous.
Petrovich!
- Bring in The mail, please.
- Yes, Sergey Nikolayevich.
Don't you think, Colonel, that your relations with your orderly are too...
You mean, patriarchal?
Not at all. They're quite up-to-date.
Times change - relations change.
Too bad you don't understand it.
When you attack, you look back for fear of getting a bullet from behind.
- We all should look back.
- I never do.
Petrovich's been with me since 1914, he's gone through all fronts with me.
- He's mad at us.
- He promises to shoot us.
- Who promises? Why?
- Chapayev. Both of us.
What for?
A fellow-villager has come to Chapayev, he was a horse-doctor there.
- So Chapayev asked us...
- He demanded!
Yes, he demanded that we put this horse-quack to a test for a doctor.
I say: No veterinarian can test a horse-quack for a doctor.
- Chapayev got mad, called us names.
- Called us sobs.
- We know you, he says, you...
...son-of-a-bitches...
You would never let any muzhik become a doctor.
- Test him, he says, right now!
- And give him a document.
And make that document according to form, or there're 7 bullets in my gun and I'm ready to spoil two of them on you!
Aha, you're here, my dears!
Complaining! You scoundrels!
Enema injectors! Forward march!
So you're with them?
Routing for the rotten intelligentsia?
- They can't do it...
- And I say they can! They must!
Why won't you let a single muzhik be promoted to a doctor?
Test him at once and give him a document according to form!
You see, they can't do it.
They don't have a right to.
Especially to give him a document.
How you dare mocking at Chapayev?!
I'll kill you, bastard!
Alexander the Great was a great military commander, too.
But why break stools?
Alexander the Great?
Military commander?
Who is he? Why don't I know him?
I know all military commanders:
Garibaldi, Napoleon, Suvorov, but this one... Alexander... the Great?
Who is he? Why don't I know him?
Not many people know him.
He lived two thousand years ago.
But you know him, so I must know him too.
It's only two years since I've learned to read.
Come on, Commissar, tell me about this Alexander the Great.
Tell you? Very well.
I'm a sailor, very trim and handsome,
I'm only twenty years old.
Listen, sailor very trim and handsome.
I've been meaning to tell you.
You should make yourself more trim.
You always look so slovenly.
You're a regular Red Army commander, you must set an example for your men.
You mean your Alexander the Great did his fighting in white gloves?
- He didn't look like a tramp. - How d'ye know what was 2,000 years ago?
Lenin rightly said that a strong home front determines the final victory.
And in our General Headquarters, instead of strengthening this front, they're still diligently counting their chickens before they hatch.
To revive Russia...
Report. Cossack Dmitry Potapov was arrested when trying to desert.
Yes, that's my signature. I can't do anything about it. Discipline.
Besides, we have a HQ directive about deserters. An order is an order.
- Wait a minute. This Potapov is your kin? - My brother.
Why didn't you say it...
To subject to execution.
Chapayev's division was pushing forward...
There's unrest in the village.
The 3rd Platoon men are marauding.
Go find platoon commander Zhikharev and bring him here.
You monsters! We've been waiting for you, and you're taking our last?
- That's the Soviet power for you.
- Hush, grandma.
At wartime, even a piglet is a godsend.
You long-legged tyrant, damn you!
What's going on, damn it!
Some merry-go-round. The Whites rob us, the Reds rob us.
What is a peasant to do?
They come here, and we shout:
"Hurray! Hurray!" Damn them!
Are they your boys plundering in the village? Did you let them to?
Me? I don't know nothing about it.
Do you realize what it means?
All right, we'll talk tomorrow.
And now you're under arrest.
Who's under arrest? Me?
A war commander?
This is not something to toy with.
Stupid.
Arrest him.
Wait. First issue an order, so that everything be returned.
- Where's Zhikharev?
- He's here, under arrest.
- You know Zhikharev's my comrade-in- arms? - I know. - And you arrest him?
How dare you? You red-tape worm!
- And do you know that he allowed...
- Never mind what he allowed!
What he allowed, only I can forbid!
You get it?
No, Comrade Division Commander!
Who's heading the division?
You or I?
You... and I.
I'm Chapayev! Do you understand that I'm Chapayev?
And you? Who are you?
Who sent you here?
Want to have a free ride on my fame?
Get the hell out of my division!
I don't need your fame.
As for recalling me from the division, only the Party that sent me can do it.
You're a Communist too, so you must know that.
Comrades, citizens, Red Army men, who is Chapay among you?
- I am.
- Aren't you lying?
No, I am not. I'm him.
Then I'm here to see you.
Thank you very much. Your boys have returned everything, to the last thing.
Otherwise it was some merry-go-round:
The Whites came and robbed us.
The Reds came and started robbing too.
What is a peasant to do?
So thank you again, from all our community.
Commissar, call up a meeting,
I'll be speaking.
Vassily Ivanovich, the Commissar seems to be a...
- And I thought he's a...
- You thought...
They wouldn't send some nobody to Chapayev.
What's going on, comrades?
Such a disgrace for our division!
The entire Red Army's been smeared!
Who are you robbing? You're robbing your brother, the peasant!
We're sacrificing our lives for that peasant and for the worker.
'Gainst 'xploitation,
'gainst all sort of capital!
Is that what the Chapayev men famous for? Are we some bandits?
So watch out, heroes! I'll shoot everyone who'll be caught plundering.
With this hand of mine,
I'll shoot the bastard!
And if I'm caught, go ahead and shoot me!
I'm your commander only in action.
When at ease, I'm your comrade.
Come to see me at midnight and later.
If I'm drinking tea, join me.
If I'm having dinner, help yourself.
That's a commander I am. Am I right?
Right!
I weren't taught in academies.
I ain't finished any.
Vassily Ivanovich, men are wondering.
Are you a Bolshevik or a Communist?
What?
Tell me, are you for the Bolsheviks or for the Communists?
I'm for the International.
- Which one, Second or Third?
- What second? - The International.
- I'm for the right one.
- So Which one?
- Lenin was in which one? - The Third.
He founded it, the Third Bolshevistic.
Then I'm for the Third International, too.
That's it.
And even ahead of time.
Good for you, Anka. You excelled in technology.
So much for the studies, Anka.
Now you're buddies with the Maxim gun.
Remember what you said about being heroes with women?
I'm going to pay a visit to the Whites.
Chapay and the commissar sent me on an important mission to get a prisoner.
- Can you?
- I can do anything.
Don't even try it! I've taken out the charges. Drop the gun and no tricks!
Have you got many perches? Craving for fish soup? Some bungler.
- It's for Mit'ka... - For whom?
- For Mit'ka...
My brother. He's dying... he wants fish soup.
- Is he wounded or what?
- No. Lashed with ramrods.
With ramrods? And you serve them after that?
Mit'ka's dying... He wants fish soup...
Please let me go.
- And you let him go?
- I did, Vassily Ivanovich.
- But I've got his gun.
You scatter-brain! Under tribunal, you loafer!
Yes, under tribunal.
And you should make yourself more trim. You always look so slovenly.
What is it? You're a soldier of the regular Red Army, my orderly.
You're supposed to set an example, and you walk about like a tramp.
Well, as I said, under tribunal!
Mit'ka's died. My brother is dead.
Vassily Ivanovich was a peasant too.
Then worked as a carpenter in Balakov.
And now he's a military commander, and what a brilliant commander!
Frunze wanted to give him an army.
You and I, says he...
- Vassily Ivanovich turned him down.
- Who is it?
- Why? Let him answer first.
- Never mind. I missed anyway.
It's good that you're not sleeping.
But you shouldn't fire aimlessly.
But as long as you fire, be a good shot.
- Everything is quiet?
- Quiet, Comrade Commissar.
Hands up!
- A scout? - No. I've come to you.
Your boy caught me and let me go.
Now I've come on my own will.
So you're Pet'ka's White. Your gun.
- So The offensive is planned for tomorrow? - Yes, sir.
- You say, The officer units?
Kappelev's? - Yes, sir.
They devised some attack at the headquarters, a psychic one...
Pet'ka, take him to the quartermaster.
Keep him in the kitchen for awhile.
Come on, big guy, they almost sent me under tribunal on your account.
What does the commissar think?
They want to stop us by the counter-offensive, so they're forming a striking force.
And what does the commander think?
Don't worry, we'll meet them.
I'm going to the political department, to have a talk with the communists.
A psychic one?
Well, what the heck, let it be the psychic one.
Hey, black raven, hey, black raven,
Why you circling over me?
I shall never be your booty...
- So we're taking a battle?
- We are. Why aren't you sleeping?
So that you wouldn't say that everyone was sleeping and you fought alone.
- Did you sleep, Vassily Ivanovich?
- I did. Go to sleep, I said!
- Was it the night before? - Are you some inspector? A Sleep Commissar?
I shall never be your booty,
I'm not the prey of yours.
Yeah, we don't have enough ammunition.
Nor enough men.
You know, you're too awesome a man for my understanding.
I'd say you're like Napoleon!
Even more, Pet'ka, even more.
Napoleon had it easier.
There were no machine-guns or air planes then. It was no big deal.
The other day they've sent me an air plane, too.
It eats so much fuel, you'd never get enough.
- Vassily Ivanovich, can you command an army? - I can.
- How about a front?
- I can, Pet'ka, I can.
- And the Republic's armed forces?
- If they teach me a bit, I can.
Can you cope it on a world scale?
No, I can't. I don't know foreign languages.
Will you go to sleep, you pain in the neck?
- They attack in 30 minutes. Everyone at their places? - Captain's not here.
I'll shoot that bastard, Zhukov.
- Pet'ka, rush to the squadron!
- Yes!
Have we got enough cartridges?
If the battle is fierce, we'll be out of them in half a hour.
Come on, cook, take it!
- Mutiny in the squadron! They killed the commander. - What? Zhukov killed?
- Take along some men.
- No! I'll manage alone.
Quiet! Don't listen to the enemy. What are we going to win by taking our own?
There're lots of masters around.
We must kill all the masters!
You can go, but don't make us go.
Enough, we've had our share of fighting. Let others fight now.
Why should we leave our homes?
Right! We won't go. No! We've had enough. Let's go home, men!
Line up! Attention!
The country's best sons are giving their lives for the cause of Revolution.
And you...
Only spilling your blood will atone for your guilt!
I will myself go at the head!
Who fired?
Who fired?
We've finished one here ourselves.
Mount horses!
- Tell me, What do men Go to their death for? - What for?
It's simple: For their life.
Everybody wants a good life.
- That's Kappelev's officer regiment.
- Where's Chapay?
Hold on, Anka. I'm dying.
The cartridges...
- They're marching beautifully.
- Aristocrats.
Shoot, bastard, shoot!
They've sold us out, men.
We're done for.
Come back!
Stop! Cowards, abandoning your comrades!
Forward!
- Why did you stop? Why the delay?
- Go to hell...
Cossacks!
At the Kappelev Regiment HQ...
God's with us! Reds cowardly flee!
The Chapay men crushed like fleas!
Swell drawing! Son-of-a-bitches!
But the verse is no good.
No, Pet'ka, put it somewhere and keep it.
- Did you call me, Vassily Ivanovich?
- Yes, I did.
What's the matter, Madame? You should have fired. Did your gun getjammed?
- No, it didn't.
- Why didn't you fire then?
- I was waiting. - Waiting for what?
- Waiting when they get closer.
Look at her... What a girl!
You fire very well. Good for you!
Pet'ka, give it here.
That's for you, as a keepsake.
Sit down and have some tea.
Autumn
Father wouldn't believe his son
That there's such thing as love.
A funny story.
The son took a saber, very sharp,
And he stabbed himself dead.
A funny story.
Yes, a very funny story.
Due to an emergency, I insist on
Furmanov's immediate departure.
He is to be succeeded by Sedov.
Frunze.
That's it, Vassily Ivanovich.
- They hurt me by this.
- They have other fronts to think of.
If it wasn't Frunze, I'd never...
This is your new commissar.
You know him very well.
The disposition of the Red forces is:
HQ and Political Dept. In Lbishchensk, the division's main forces under
Yelan's command are in Sakharnaya.
As you see, the HQ remains isolated, and can be reached by the steppe.
This is our only chance to do away with Chapayev.
Yes, this is our last chance to annihilate Chapayev and hold Lbishchensk.
There's no other way.
We need a brave, determined officer to head this operation.
- To whom do you plan to entrust it?
- I would be happy if...
- You entrusted me with this operation.
- I could hope for nothing better.
I put the fate of our front in your hands.
By the way, the Allied Command valued Chapayev's head at 20,000.
The Allied Command could afford to give even more.
Behind him is the city of Guriev, and Guriev has oil.
The storm was rolling, raining hard,
The thunder roared, holding grip,
A lightning sparkled like a dart,
The tempest rolling in the deep.
The night is pitch-black, we should double the guards.
The Cossack tribe beat it as far as
Guriev.
- They won't dare to come near me.
- Look, Vassily Ivanovich.
All right, tell them to put up additionalposts.
- How lucky you are! - What?
- I say you and Pet'ka are so lucky!
- You're young, with your whole life to live. - You're not old yourself.
Old or not, but I'm not like your
Pet'ka.
You'll get married, you'll work together.
The war will be over, you'll have a beautiful life.
Do you know what life will be like?
You'll never wish to die.
No one wants to die.
But our struggle is such that we can't spare our lives.
Either we win, or they win.
No, we win.
Why did you stop singing? Come on...
Well, will I make a good performer?
Everything is quiet. The road is clear.
Stop! Where are you going? Down!
Let's run to the guns!
Sakharnaya! Sakharnaya!
- They cut it, bastards! - Ride to
Sakharnaya, to Yelan! Both of you!
Go on, I say!
I can't leave him! And you go!
Goodbye!
- It's you?
- Me.
- That's it! We have to retreat.
- Chapayev never retreats.
Chapayev is wounded. Take him over the river!
Go ahead, swim. I can manage myself.
No, you won't get me!
Forward!
Fire!

AN ADMIRABLE QUALITY.
WE SO SELDOM
APPRECIATE IT FULLY...
UNTIL IT IS WITHDRAWN.
[PEARSON]
YOU KNOW, THE FIRST TIME
I WAS IN BENGAL,
I SAW A FALCON
BREAK A LAMB'S BACK.
BEASTLY BIRDS.
YES, I THINK
I'LL SEND ONE
BACK TO MY FAMILY.
JUST THE THING
FOR A MAYFAIR
DRAWING ROOM.
ANCIENT SPORT
OF KINGS--FALCONRY.
THE APPEAL LIES
IN ITS CRUELTY.
I'D TAKE A POTSHOT
AGAINST A TIGER
IN LONG GRASS ANY DAY.
THEY'RE MAN-EATERS,
YOU KNOW.
ONLY A SAVAGE
WOULD PREFER
THIS SORT OF THING.
[SIR HUMPHREY]
AHEM. QUITE SO.
QUITE SO, VICKERS.
WHY, YOUR HIGHNESS,
I MEANT, OF COURSE--
NO, NO, NO, NO.
I DARESAY YOU'RE
PERFECTLY JUSTIFIED.
HOWEVER, THE SURISTANIS
ARE AN ANCIENT RACE
OF PEOPLE.
THEY CANNOT SO EASILY
FORGET THEIR ANCIENT
TRIBAL WAYS OF LIFE.
THANK YOU, SIR.
I TRUST YOU'LL
ACCEPT MY APOLOGY.
OH, PLEASE,
PLEASE, PLEASE.
BORIS.
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
GENTLEMEN, LET US
GO IN TO DINNER.
UH, BY THE WAY,
SIR HUMPHREY,
YOU WOULD DO ME
THE HONOR IF YOU
AND YOUR GENTLEMEN
WERE TO JOIN ME
TOMORROW MORNING
AT A LEOPARD HUNT
I'VE ARRANGED.
WE START AT SUNRISE,
THE TRADITIONAL HOUR.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
[MEN SHOUTING]
[ELEPHANT TRUMPETS]
FINE FELLOW--
THE KHAN.
THERE'S A MAN
WHO CAN TAKE A LOSS
WITH GOOD GRACE.
YES. I DON'T THINK
I COULD LOSE £150,000
A YEAR WITH GRACE.
GREAT SCOTT,
VICKERS!
NOBODY BUT
THE HOME GOVERNMENT
WERE SUPPOSED
TO KNOW ANYTHING
OF THE REAL REASON BEHIND
THIS DIPLOMATIC VISIT
OF MINE.
SORRY, SIR, BUT UP HERE
ON THE FRONTIER,
THERE AREN'T
MANY SECRETS AN OFFICER
IN MY POSITION
DOESN'T GET TO KNOW
SOONER OR LATER.
BESIDES, I'VE COME
TO KNOW THE KHAN
PRETTY WELL.
THEN YOU MUST KNOW
THE SITUATION HAS BEEN
A DEVILISH, DELICATE ONE.
HOWEVER, I AM
QUITE CONFIDENT
THAT HE WON'T TRIFLE
WITH OUR FRIENDSHIP.
BESIDES,
THE MAN'S A GENTLEMAN.
ANYONE CAN SEE THAT.
YES, OF COURSE, SIR.
YES.
ANYONE CAN SEE THAT.
[DRUMS BEATING
AND MEN SHOUTING]
[GROWLING]
[GROWLS]
YOU HAVE THE HONOR,
SIR HUMPHREY.
THE KHAN WANTS
YOU TO TAKE
FIRST SHOT, SIR.
HUH? OH. OH.
THANK YOU. SPLENDID.
[GUNSHOT]
MISSED HIM
BY A HAIR, SIR.
BAD LUCK.
[GUNSHOT]
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
FINE SHOT, SIR.
[SIR HUMPHREY]
EXCELLENT MARKSMANSHIP, SIR.
[SURAT KHAN SPEAKING

[ELEPHANT TRUMPETING]
[SHOUTING

[GROWLS]
[GROWLS]
[LEOPARD GROWLING]
SAHIB.
[MEN SHOUTING
IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
ARE YOU HURT,
YOUR HIGHNESS?
NO, NOT AT ALL.
BRILLIANT SHOT,
VICKERS.
IT WAS WORTHY
OF YOU.
IT WAS A LUCKY ONE.
I SHALL NEVER
FORGET IT.
MY GRATITUDE
WILL BE ETERNAL.
[SPEAKING
FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
WELL, GOOD-BYE,
DARLING.
GOOD-BYE, DEAR.
NOW, REMEMBER,
YOU SIMPLY MUST BE
BACK EARLY
IF WE'RE TO BE READY
FOR THE GOVERNOR GENERAL'S
BALL TONIGHT.
OH, THE BALL, YES.
I SUPPOSE YOU FEEL
QUITE CAPABLE
OF TAKING CARE
OF YOURSELF
AMONG ALL THESE--
OH, HOW SILLY.
A RESPONSIBLE LADY
OF MY YEARS IS
PERFECTLY SAFE ANYWHERE.
YES, I SUPPOSE SO.
WELL...GOOD-BYE.
[SPEAKING
FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
GOOD-BYE.
[SPEAKING
FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
ELSA, I'M SO GLAD
YOU WERE ABLE TO COME.
YOUR MESSAGE SAID
IT WAS URGENT.
IT IS.
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
MY BROTHER ARRIVES
IN CALCUTTA TODAY.
HOW DO YOU KNOW?
WORD CAME THROUGH
FROM HEADQUARTERS
LAST NIGHT.
NOW YOU'LL UNDERSTAND
WHY IT WAS SO URGENT
FOR ME TO SEE YOU.
GEOFFREY'S
COMING HERE.
ELSA,
THERE'S SOMETHING
I MUST KNOW.
YOU DO LOVE ME,
DON'T YOU?
OH, PERRY.
I KNOW WE BOTH TRIED
TO BE LOYAL TO GEOFFREY
BY HIDING
OUR REAL FEELINGS,
BUT NOW HE'S
COMING BACK, AND WE
CAN'T GO ON PRETENDING.
YOU DO LOVE ME,
DON'T YOU?
OH, PERRY, I'VE TRIED
SO HARD NOT TO,
BUT I DO LOVE YOU.
I KNEW IT.
BUT I'M STILL ENGAGED
TO GEOFFREY.
WE MUST TELL HIM
THE MOMENT HE GETS HERE.
I MEAN, I MUST TELL HIM.
IT'S MY RESPONSIBILITY.
AND WHEN HE KNOWS
HOW WE FEEL, HE WON'T
STAND IN OUR WAY.
BUT SUPPOSING
HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND.
HE WILL.
DARLING, I KNOW HIM
BETTER THAN ANYONE.
I'VE GOT TO TELL HIM.
IT'S THE ONLY DECENT
THING TO DO.
YES.
YES, IT IS.
I MUST BE GETTING
BACK NOW.
FATHER WILL BE
WORRYING ABOUT ME.
YES. YOU'RE RIGHT.
WILL I SEE YOU
TONIGHT AT THE BALL?
YES, PERRY...
TONIGHT.
IT'S ONLY NOW THAT
THE STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE
OF THE SITUATION
BECOMES APPARENT.
THE SAFETY OF
THE NORTHWEST FRONTIER
HINGES ON LOHARA,
WHICH IS THE BASE
FOR THE THREE
ADVANCE GARRISONS,
OF WHICH CHUKOTI
IS THE MOST IMPORTANT.
THEREFORE, TWO
OF OUR ABLEST OFFICERS
MUST COMMAND AT LOHARA
AND CHUKOTI.
I'VE HAD TO
TRANSFER WOODWARD
BECAUSE I'M AFRAID
HE'S TOO WELL ON IN YEARS
FOR AN ACTIVE COMMAND.
YOU SEE, WITH
SURAT KHAN JUST ACROSS
THE SURISTAN BORDER
IN A POSITION TO MAKE
THE APPROACH TO THE PASS
UNCOMFORTABLE,
I FEEL CONFIDENT
THAT WITH YOU,
CAMPBELL, AT CHUKOTI
AND YOU, WARRENTON,
AT LOHARA,
WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO HANDLE
ANY AGGRESSIVE COMPLICATION
THAT MAY ARISE.
CAPTAIN VICKERS,
SIR.
YES, SIR.
OH, SHOW HIM IN.
JUST A MOMENT.
CAPTAIN VICKERS,
27th LANCERS,
REPORTING FOR DUTY, SIR.
[MAN]
BEEN EXPECTING YOU,
VICKERS.
THE WAR OFFICE
IS SENDING YOU ON
A VERY IMPORTANT MISSION.
OH, SPLENDID,
SIR.
YOU'RE GOING
ON AN EXPEDITION
TO BUY CAVALRY HORSES
IN THE TATAR COUNTRIES.
OH.
DOES THAT MEAN
WE'RE PREPARING
FOR WAR, SIR?
WHATEVER IT MEANS,
YOU'RE TO DELIVER
THE HORSES YOU'VE PURCHASED
TO OUR FLEET AT BATUM
ON THE BLACK SEA.
FROM THERE,
THEY'RE TO BE SHIPPED
TO THE CRIMEA.
THAT CLEAR?
YES, SIR.
OH, WARRENTON, CAMPBELL,
YOU KNOW VICKERS.
[CAMPBELL]
YES, OF COURSE.
GEOFFREY, MY BOY,
HOW VERY NICE
TO SEE YOU.
GLAD TO SEE YOU,
TOO, SIR.
HOW DO YOU      HOW DO YOU DO,
DO, SIR?        VICKERS?
HAVE YOU SEEN ELSA?
NO, NOT YET, SIR.
HOW IS SHE?
SHE'LL BE VERY HAPPY
TO SEE YOU, I KNOW.
I CAN HARDLY WAIT
UNTIL I SEE HER EITHER.
GOOD MORNING, SIR.
GOOD MORNING.
OH, CAPTAIN VICKERS.
YES?
YOUR BROTHER IS HERE, SIR,
INSIDE WITH SIR CHARLES.
OH, YES. THANK YOU.
YES, SIR.
[PERRY]
GEOFF.
PERRY!
BY JOVE,
I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU,
YOU OLD DIPLOMATIC
GLOBETROTTER, YOU!
IT MUST BE
MORE THAN A YEAR
SINCE WE LAST MET.
COME IN HERE, GEOFFREY.
IT'S QUIETER. I HAVE SOMETHING
IMPORTANT TO SAY TO YOU.
I BET YOU HAVE. I HAVE
AT LEAST A MILLION
THINGS TO SAY TO YOU,
EVERY ONE OF THEM
OF VITAL IMPORTANCE.
WELL,
LET'S GO INSIDE.
NO. I CAN'T JUST NOW.
I GOT A VERY URGENT
APPOINTMENT.
TONIGHT AND TOMORROW,
WE CAN TALK
OUR HEADS OFF,
BUT JUST NOW...
SEE YOU LATER.
SO, YOU SEE, IT DEPENDS
ON YOU, GENTLEMEN.
AND I THOUGHT I WAS
WELL-ACQUAINTED
WITH THE SITUATION.
BUT I DON'T QUITE
UNDERSTAND
SURAT KHAN'S
PRESENCE IN
CALCUTTA, SIR.
AND THIS DANCE THAT
THE GOVERNOR GENERAL
IS GIVING
IN HIS HONOR
AT THE GOVERNMENT
HOUSE TONIGHT.
FLATTERY IS
THE FOOD OF FOOLS,
BUT NOW AND THEN,
YOUR MEN OF WIT
WILL CONDESCEND
TO TAKE A BIT.
I SEE. FLATTERY
AND FRIENDSHIP,
SO TO SPEAK.
SURAT KHAN, DEVILING US UP
ON THE FRONTIER,
SEEMS TO BE DOING PRECISELY
WHAT THE RUSSIAN CZAR
IS DOING IN THE BALKANS.
YOU'VE READ
THE NEWS DISPATCHES
ABOUT THE COSSACKS
PLUNDERING OUTLYING
TURKISH VILLAGES.
MMM. IT'S AN OLD TRICK,
YOU KNOW--
DEVILING YOUR NEIGHBOR
INTO A WAR.
ONE WOULD ALMOST
THINK THAT THERE'S
RUSSIAN INFLUENCE
AT THE BACK
OF SURAT KHAN,
WHAT WITH RUSSIA'S
VITAL NEED FOR
OPEN-WATER SEAPORTS,
AMONGST OTHER THINGS.
YOU'LL ACT ONLY
ON ORDERS FROM SIR BENJAMIN.
I UNDERSTAND, SIR.
I WANT YOU
TO UNDERSTAND, ALSO,
THAT IT'S IMPERATIVE
THERE SHOULD BE
NO INCIDENT
THAT COULD CAUSE
A FRONTIER WAR
AT THIS TIME.
WE MUST MAINTAIN PEACE...
AT ANY COST.
[MAN SHOUTING COMMANDS

[MAN]
MAJOR GORDON
AND MRS. GORDON.
SIR ARCHIBALD McMURRAY.
LADY McMURRAY.
MISS VERONICA McMURRAY.
SIR CHARLES MILLER
AND LADY MILLER.
[WARRENTON]
YOU REMEMBER
MAJOR BARRETT.
OH, MAJOR BARRETT.
AND,
LADY PELHAM,
MY WIFE.
LADY PELHAM,
GOOD EVENING.
AND THIS, MY DEAR,
IS COLONEL CAMPBELL,
WHO LEAVES TOMORROW
TO ASSUME COMMAND
OF THE CHUKOTI GARRISON.
COLONEL CAMPBELL,
I AM PLEASED THAT
WE HAVE MET AT LAST.
BENJI,
KINDLY STAY HERE.
MY DEAR,
I WAS JUST GOING--
TO THE REFRESHMENT ROOM
TO GET A DRINK. I KNOW.
THEN YOU'LL BE
UPSET ALL NIGHT.
HERE. TAKE A PILL.
LIFE WITH YOU IS
JUST ONE BLASTED
PILL AFTER ANOTHER--
UH, MY LOVE.
HA HA HA! JUST LIKE
A CHILD--BENJI.
NO IDEA OF WHAT'S
GOOD FOR HIM.
I HEAR YOU HAVE
A BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTER,
COLONEL.
YOU MUST LET ME TAKE HER
UNDER MY WING AT ONCE.
ABOUT TO BE MARRIED,
ISN'T SHE?
THAT'S SPLENDID.
YOU MUST LET ME CHOOSE
HER TROUSSEAU.
YOU'RE A WIDOWER,
ARE YOU NOT?
I AM,
LADY WARRENTON.
WELL, I ALWAYS SAY...
BENJI.
YES. I KNOW.
TAKE ANOTHER PILL.
[GEOFF]
ELSA, DARLING.
YOU LOOK SO LOVELY.
I'M SORRY I MISSED YOU
AT THE HOUSE.
[ELSA]
I'M SORRY, TOO, GEOFF.
[GEOFF]
WHY, IT'S BEEN SO LONG,
I HARDLY KNOW
WHAT TO SAY TO YOU.
WE'LL HAVE PLENTY
OF TIME NOW, THOUGH.
I HATE THESE SEPARATIONS.
[ELSA]
YOU DIDN'T TELL HIM,
DID YOU?
[PERRY]
I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE.
[ELSA]
HOW I HATE THIS DECEPTION.
[PERRY]
ELSA, DARLING,
THEY'RE WATCHING.
[MAN]
HIS HIGHNESS SURAT KHAN,
AMIR OF SURISTAN.
COUNT IGOR VOLONOFF.
HIS EXCELLENCY
THE WAZIR OF SURISTAN.
THE NAWAB OF DAJAL.
TAKE CHARGE,
MY FRIEND.
I'M ON DUTY.
TAKE CHARGE
OF WHAT?
[WOMAN]
MY! HOW YOU'VE CHANGED.
[RANDALL]
FOR THE BETTER, I HOPE.
[WOMAN]
I ALWAYS LIKED THE CAVALRY.
MAY I HAVE A WORD
WITH YOU, SIR?
HMM? CERTAINLY.
SURAT KHAN'S
JUST ARRIVED.
WELL?
HE'S GOT
A COUNT IGOR VOLONOFF
WITH HIM.
AH, VOLONOFF. THAT'S
A JUICY, CLEVER GESTURE.
OSTENTATIOUSLY FLIRTING
WITH RUSSIA, EH?
TWO STRINGS TO HIS BOW.
AH, WELL, WE'LL SEE.
OF COURSE, IT MIGHT BE
JUST A COINCIDENCE.
THE SUN MIGHT RISE
IN THE WEST.
WELL, I'LL FINISH
MY DRINK.
I HAVE
A COWARDLY AVERSION
TO MEETING REPTILES
SOCIALLY
TILL I'VE HAD
AT LEAST ONE SHERRY
AND BITTERS.
GOOD EVENING,
SIR CHARLES,
CAPTAIN VICKERS.
GOOD EVENING,
YOUR HIGHNESS.
SIR CHARLES MACEFIELD,
MAY I HAVE THE PLEASURE
OF PRESENTING COUNT VOLONOFF?
CAPTAIN VICKERS,
COUNT VOLONOFF.
HOW DO YOU DO?
HOW DO YOU DO?
HOW DO YOU DO?
IT'S VERY PLEASANT,
YOUR HIGHNESS,
TO FIND YOU
IN THESE FRIVOLOUS
SURROUNDINGS.
WELL, SIR CHARLES,
SINCE YOUR KINDLY GOVERNMENT
HAS SPARED ME THE BURDEN
OF DISPENSING ITS ANNUAL
APPRECIATION TO MY COUNTRYMEN,
I AM BLESSED
WITH MORE LEISURE.
AH, WELL,
COME WITH ME.
I'LL PRESENT
SOME REALLY AMUSING
PEOPLE TO YOU.
THERE'S
MY DAUGHTER NOW.
SHE'S ENTRANCING.
ELSA IS A FINE GAL.
AND THE GALLANT
YOUNG CAVALIER
WHO HOLDS HER SO TENDERLY
IN HIS ARMS--
HER FIANCE, OF COURSE.
OH, CERTAINLY NOT.
BUT SHE IS ENGAGED.
YOU SAID SHE--
TO CAPTAIN
GEOFFREY VICKERS
OF THE 27th.
THAT'S MERELY
HIS BROTHER,
A DIPLOMAT OF SORTS,
SECONDED
FROM HIS REGIMENT
FOR DUTY
WITH THE POLITICAL
DEPARTMENT.
OH, DEAR.
HOW SILLY OF ME.
THEY DO SEEM TO BE ENJOYING
EACH OTHER'S COMPANY.
[PERRY]
LET'S GET AWAY FROM HERE, ELSA.
CHARMING...
AND MOTHERLESS.
WELL, AS I ALWAYS SAY,
COLONEL, IT'S NEVER TOO LATE.
I MUST START LOOKING AROUND
RIGHT AWAY
TO FIND A SUITABLE WIFE
FOR YOU.
REALLY, OCTAVIA.
YOU MUST BE A LITTLE
MORE GUARDED--
KEEP QUIET, BENJI.
COLONEL CAMPBELL HAS
JUST BEEN BEGGING ME
TO FIND HIM A WIFE.
WHAT PARTICULAR QUALITY DO YOU
MOST ADMIRE IN A WOMAN?
THE QUALITY
OF SILENCE.
NOW, COLONEL,
YOU'RE FLATTERING ME,
JUST AS
DEAR LORD MELVIN DID.
ONCE WHEN WE SAT
NEXT TO EACH OTHER
IN AN INTOLERABLE
GUILDHALL BANQUET,
"LADY WARRENTON,"
HE SAID,
"YOU HAVE THE POWER
TO DRIVE MEN MAD."
I CAN BELIEVE THAT.
FORGIVE ME.
WHAT A DULL DOG
THE COLONEL IS.
HASN'T A WORD TO SAY
FOR HIMSELF.
BENJI.
[PERRY]
I LOVE YOU
SO MUCH, ELSA.
YOU LOOK
SO BEAUTIFUL.
I--I CAN'T STAND
THIS ANY LONGER.
WE'VE GOT TO
FIND A WAY TO TELL
GEOFFREY TONIGHT.
YES, YES.
I KNOW, I KNOW.
WE SHOULDN'T BE SEEN OUT HERE
TOGETHER. YOU KNOW THIS PLACE
IS FULL OF SCANDALMONGERS.
BUT I HAD TO SEE YOU
ALONE.
WE CAN'T GO ON
DECEIVING GEOFFREY
LIKE THIS.
DARLING, I KNOW
HE'LL UNDERSTAND.
HE'S A GREAT FELLOW.
HE'S HUMAN.
IT'S JUST BECAUSE OF THAT
WE MUSTN'T HURT HIM ANY MORE
THAN WE CAN HELP.
LET ME TELL HIM
IN MY OWN WAY. AFTER ALL,
IT'S MY RESPONSIBILITY.
WHEN HE KNOWS
HOW WE REALLY FEEL,
HE CAN'T THINK
THAT WE'RE IN THE WRONG.
WRONG?
IT'S ONLY WRONG
IF WE DON'T TELL HIM.
LET'S FACE THE TRUTH.
WE'RE IN LOVE
WITH ONE ANOTHER.
WE ALWAYS WILL BE.
[COLONEL CAMPBELL]
ELSA.
YOU WILL RETURN
TO THE BALLROOM
AT ONCE.
MAY I SAY, SIR--
I AM NOT INTERESTED
IN WHAT YOU HAVE
TO SAY.
THERE CAN BE
NO EXCUSE FOR A MAN
WHO IS SO DISLOYAL
AS TO TRIFLE
WITH THE AFFECTIONS OF
HIS BROTHER'S FIANCEE.
I FORBID YOU
TO EVER SEE OR SPEAK
TO MY DAUGHTER AGAIN.
I AM NOT BEING
DISLOYAL, SIR.
ELSA AND I
LOVE EACH OTHER.
LOVE?
CHEAP INFATUATION.
YOU DESERVE
A GOOD THRASHING.
PERRY...PLEASE GO.
AND AS I DOUBT THAT
YOU HAVE THE COURAGE
TO INFORM YOUR BROTHER
OF THIS TREACHERY,
REST ASSURED
THAT I SHALL TELL HIM.
MY BROTHER KNOWS ME
TOO WELL TO ACCUSE ME
OF TREACHERY, SIR.
ELSA, I'LL SEE YOU
AGAIN BEFORE YOU LEAVE
FOR CHUKOTI.
ONE MOMENT,
CAPTAIN VICKERS.
EVEN THOUGH
YOU'VE BEEN SECONDED
FOR THE POLITICAL
SERVICE,
YOU STILL RETAIN
YOUR ARMY RANK.
WELL, SIR?
THEREFORE, YOU
WILL DO AS I SAY.
IF NOT, I SHALL
HAVE YOU RECALLED
TO ENGLAND
FOR GROSS
INSUBORDINATION.
VERY WELL, SIR.
[CLICKS HEELS]
ELSA, I AM
AT AN ABSOLUTE LOSS
TO UNDERSTAND
YOUR ATTITUDE.
FATHER, I LOVE HIM.
YOU REALLY BELIEVE
YOU LOVE?
I SEE.
NOW I UNDERSTAND
THE STRANGENESS
OF YOUR BEHAVIOR
FOR SOME TIME PAST.
BUT YOU
MUST REMEMBER...
THAT YOU LOVED
GEOFFREY WHEN
YOU ACCEPTED HIM.
HE'S BEEN AWAY
A LONG TIME,
AND NOW
THAT HE'S BACK,
YOU MUST REALIZE
THAT THAT LOVE
IS STILL THERE
AND THIS IS
MERELY A PASSING
INFATUATION.
I WISH
YOU WERE RIGHT, FATHER.
I'VE FOUGHT AND FOUGHT
AGAINST IT,
BUT I LOVE HIM.
ELSA, MY DEAR,
I'VE TAKEN CARE
OF YOU
EVER SINCE
YOUR MOTHER DIED.
LET ME KNOW WHAT
IS BEST FOR YOU.
GEOFFREY'S
A SPLENDID FELLOW,
LOVES YOU
WITH ALL HIS HEART.
YOU CAN'T
WANTONLY HURT HIM.
OH, I DON'T WISH
TO HURT GEOFFREY.
OF COURSE YOU DON'T,
MY DARLING.
THERE, NOW.
DRY YOUR EYES.
LET'S FORGET THIS
LITTLE INCIDENT,
AND PROMISE
WHEN YOU MEET HIM
TONIGHT,
YOU'LL TREAT HIM
AS THOUGH NOTHING
HAS HAPPENED.
I'LL TRY, FATHER.
THAT'S A GIRL.
COME.
WILL YOUR HIGHNESS
EXCUSE ME?
WHY, OF COURSE.
SOME BEAUTIFUL
LADY IS WAITING,
NO DOUBT.
YES, NO DOUBT.
EXCUSE ME, SIR.
[CLICKS HEELS]
MY GOOD FRIEND
THE GALLANT
CAPTAIN VICKERS
ONCE SAVED MY LIFE,
AND AS YOU KNOW,
IN MY COUNTRY,
SIR CHARLES,
FRIENDSHIP CAN BE
CLAIMED BY FRIENDLY
ACTIONS ALONE.
YES. IN THIS
TREACHEROUS LIFE,
IT'S DIFFICULT
TO KNOW WHICH IS FRIEND
AND WHICH IS FOE.
BUT IN THE END,
ONE FINDS OUT,
AND THE WISE MAN
ACTS ACCORDINGLY.
YES.
AHEM. YES.
ARE YOU STAYING LONG
IN CALCUTTA,
YOUR HIGHNESS?
A FEW DAYS, I FANCY,
UNLESS, OF COURSE,
THE, UH...
UNLESS WHAT,
YOUR HIGHNESS?
I SOMETIMES THINK,
SIR CHARLES,
THAT A GREAT
GOVERNMENT RESEMBLES
A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN,
WHO, INTOXICATED
WITH THE POWER
OF HER OWN BEAUTY,
IS APT TO
WITHDRAW FROM
A SINCERE SUITOR
THE FAVORS SHE'S
ALWAYS GRANTED,
AND WHEN SHE FINDS
THIS SUITOR
CONSOLE HIMSELF
WITH ANOTHER BEAUTY,
REGRETS
HER COLDNESS.
INTERESTING. AND WHAT
DOES SHE DO THEN?
SHE CLAIMS THE PRIVILEGE
OF ANY BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
AND CHANGES HER MIND
BEFORE SHE'S LOST
HER SUITOR FOREVER.
DO YOU NOT AGREE?
THE ONLY GREAT GOVERNMENT
I'M ACQUAINTED WITH
IS SINGULARLY MASCULINE.
IT MAKES UP ITS MIND,
AND ONCE HAVING REACHED
A DECISION, ADHERES TO IT.
I'M AFRAID WE'RE
LOSING OURSELVES
IN A FLIGHT
OF FANTASY.
[CHUCKLES]
YES. PERHAPS. YES.
OH, GEOFF.
PERRY, OLD LAD,
HAVE YOU SEEN ELSA?
LADY WARRENTON,
THIS IS MY BROTHER
GEOFFREY.
HOW DO YOU DO?
YOU ARE THE FIANCE
OF THAT EXQUISITE
CHILD. AM I RIGHT?
YOU ARE RIGHT.
CAPITAL.
I CONGRATULATE YOU,
BUT YOU MUST KEEP AN EYE
ON THIS VERY ATTRACTIVE
BROTHER OF YOURS.
I SAW MISS CAMPBELL AND HIM
DANCING TONIGHT.
THE LOOK IN HIS EYE
WAS ANYTHING BUT DIPLOMATIC.
AHA.
BENJI!
MR. VICKERS,
NEVER MARRY A MAN
WITH AN INDIAN LIVER.
LADY WARRENTON,
I WON'T.
BENJI!
THANK HEAVENS.
OH, GEOFFREY,
THERE'S SOMETHING I WANT
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.
OH, THERE'S ELSA NOW.
WAIT A MINUTE, OLD BOY.
ELSA, DARLING,
I'M SORRY I MISSED
SO MANY DANCES.
YOU KNOW HOW
THESE DIPLOMATIC
AFFAIRS ARE.
SHALL WE DANCE NOW?
I'D LOVE TO.
DO YOU MIND, SIR?
NOT AT ALL.
LOOK AROUND YOU.
WHY?
HERE
IN THIS ONE ROOM,
YOU CAN SEE EVERYTHING
THAT MAKES THE WORLD
GO ROUND--
RICHES, INTRIGUE,
AND ALL THE SEEDS
OF MUTINY, WAR,
AND HATRED.
YOU KNOW WHAT IT ALL
MEANS TO ME?
WHAT?
NOTHING.
JUST NOTHING.
YOU'RE
THE ONLY THING
THAT'S REAL HERE.
ALL I KNOW IS
THAT I'M HOLDING YOU
IN MY ARMS
AND THAT...
THAT
YOU'RE SO LOVELY.
OH, GEOFFREY.
ELSA...I LOVE YOU.
[WHISTLING]
HELLO, OLD LAD.
GLAD YOU CAME IN
AND WAITED.
I HAD TO.
MIGHT HAVE MISSED
YOU COMPLETELY.
I'M OFF AGAIN
TOMORROW.
ARE YOU GOING
WITH THE CAMPBELLS
TO CHUKOTI?
NO. WORSE LUCK.
I'M GOING UP
ON THE ARABIAN
FRONTIER
TO BUY A PACK
OF HORSES.
WE NEED PLENTY
OF THEM, YOU KNOW,
AND GOOD ONES.
SOUNDS
LIKE TROUBLE
ON THE BALKANS.
YES. THAT'S
WHAT I THOUGHT, TOO.
I TRIED TO SOUND OUT
OLD MACEFIELD ABOUT IT,
BUT HE CLOSED UP
LIKE AN OYSTER.
HOWEVER, IT MUST BE THAT.
HE TOLD ME TO HURRY,
AND WILL I.
YOU CAN IMAGINE WHY.
GEOFFREY...I...
I'VE NEVER
THANKED YOU FOR ALL
YOU'VE DONE FOR ME.
OH, NONSENSE,
OLD LAD.
YOU'VE BEEN A SUCCESS.
I'M PROUD OF YOU.
BUT SOMETHING'S
HAPPENED.
I KNOW
YOU'LL UNDERSTAND.
WELL, WHAT?
I'VE FALLEN
IN LOVE WITH ELSA.
OH, I'M SORRY, OLD LAD.
HOW ROTTEN FOR YOU.
YES, BUT, GEOFF,
ELSA'S IN LOVE WITH ME.
I DON'T THINK YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.
I DO, UNFORTUNATELY.
WE TRIED NOT TO.
HONESTLY, WE DID,
GEOFF.
I SEE.
MIGHT I ASK
WHAT YOU INTEND
DOING ABOUT IT?
HAS ELSA TOLD YOU
THAT SHE LOVES YOU?
HAS SHE PROMISED
TO MARRY YOU?
YES, BUT NOT
IN SO MANY WORDS.
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.
YOU'RE LYING.
THIS IS SPLENDID.
AFTER SNIVELING
TO ME ABOUT HOW
GRATEFUL HE IS,
MY BROTHER COMES
TO ME AND TELLS ME
HE'S STOLEN
THE AFFECTIONS OF
THE ONE PERSON I LOVE
MOST IN THE WORLD.
BUT NOT CONTENT
WITH THAT,
YOU'VE GOT
THE EFFRONTERY TO
COME HERE AND LIE.
YOU CAN'T
BELIEVE THAT.
LIE AND LIE.
LISTEN...
YOU'D BETTER
GET OUT.
TAKE YOUR DIRTY INTRIGUE
SOMEWHERE ELSE,
BUT GET OUT OF MY SIGHT
AND STAY OUT.
VERY WELL,
BUT LET ME
TELL YOU THIS.
I'VE ALWAYS
LOOKED UP TO YOU,
WORSHIPED YOU
AS A KIND OF GOD.
I FIND YOU'RE RATHER
A LITTLE MAN.
AND AS FAR
AS I'M CONCERNED,
YOU AND OLD CAMPBELL
AND THE WHOLE BLASTED ARMY
CAN GO TO BLAZES.
OH, GOOD MORNING,
SIR.
OH, GEOFFREY.
EARLY VISIT, HUH?
YES, SIR. I JUST HAD
MY ORDERS, AND I'M
SETTING OUT.
I THOUGHT I'D
COME ALONG AND SAY
GOOD-BYE TO YOU.
JUST TO ME?
WELL, SHALL WE SAY
THE FAMILY?
ELSA'S STILL IN HER ROOM,
BUT I'LL CALL HER.
TELL MEMSAHIB SHE'S WANTED
IN THE STUDY IMMEDIATELY.
CAPTAIN VICKERS IS HERE.
[SPEAKING FOREIGN
LANGUAGE]
YOU HAVE
A VERY DIFFICULT JOB
AHEAD OF YOU.
YES, I THINK SO.
BUT I'M SURE
YOU'RE EQUAL TO IT.
THANK YOU, SIR.
SO GOOD-BYE.
GOOD-BYE, SIR.
COME BACK TO US
SAFELY AND SOON.
THANK YOU.
OH, GEOFFREY.
WHAT'S THIS I HEAR?
ARE YOU LEAVING US
SO SOON?
YES, I'M AFRAID SO.
I SUPPOSE THIS IS
WHAT'S KNOWN
AS THE LUCK
OF THE ARMY.
THEY SHOW YOU
A BRIEF GLIMPSE
OF PARADISE
AND THEN
TAKE IT AWAY.
I SUPPOSE, IN TIME,
I'LL LEARN
TO BE GRATEFUL
FOR EVEN A FEW HOURS
WITH YOU.
HOW LONG WILL YOU
BE AWAY?
OH, A MONTH, TWO MONTHS.
HARD TO SAY.
THERE'S SO MUCH TROUBLE
GOING ON EVERYWHERE,
WE'VE GOT TO BE
READY FOR IT
WHEN IT COMES,
BUT AS SOON AS I
COME BACK THIS TIME,
WE'RE NOT GOING
TO LET THE ARMY
OR ANYTHING ELSE
INTERFERE
WITH OUT HAPPINESS,
OUR MARRIAGE,
ARE WE, DARLING?
OF COURSE NOT,
GEOFFREY.
RIGHT.
IT'S A BARGAIN.
GOOD-BYE, MY LOVE.
I'LL HURRY BACK
SO FAST.
OH...
ELSA,
THERE'S SOMETHING...
I THINK I OUGHT
TO TELL YOU
BEFORE I GO.
IT'S RATHER SILLY,
BUT LAST NIGHT
AFTER THE BALL,
PERRY
CAME TO SEE ME.
HE'S IN LOVE
WITH YOU.
YOU KNOW, HE'S
QUITE IMPULSIVE,
AND HE SEEMS
TO BE TAKING THIS
PRETTY SERIOUSLY.
I WAS VERY STUPID
ABOUT IT.
I LOST MY TEMPER
COMPLETELY.
NOW, OF COURSE,
I COULD KICK MYSELF,
BUT I DON'T
WANT HIM TO BE HURT
MORE THAN NECESSARY,
YOU KNOW?
YOU NEEDN'T WORRY, GEOFF.
I SHAN'T BE SEEING PERRY
IN ANY CASE.
FATHER'S BEING SENT
TO CHUKOTI,
AND, OF COURSE,
I'LL GO WITH HIM,
AND PERRY
WILL SOON FORGET.
YES, OF COURSE HE WILL.
THAT'S JUST LIKE YOU,
ELSA, TO UNDERSTAND IT
LIKE THAT.
I MUST GO NOW.
THINK OF ME A LITTLE
WHILE I'M AWAY.
I WILL.
GOOD-BYE
AND GOOD LUCK.
GOOD-BYE, MY LOVE.
THEY'RE MOVING
ALONG FINE.
HOPE WE MISS
THAT STORM
BEHIND US.
HOPE WE MISS
ANY OTHER SORT OF TROUBLE.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND, SIR,
WHY THESE NORTHERN TRIBES
ARE SO HOSTILE.
SINCE TURKEY'S DECLARED WAR
ON RUSSIA,
ALL THESE FELLOWS KNOW
THAT ENGLAND AND FRANCE
ARE BOUND TO COME IN
ON THE SIDE OF TURKEY.
YES. IT'S ALL
VERY COZY.
THESE TRIBESMAN
ARE GOING
TO SYMPATHIZE
WITH THE RUSSIANS.
THAT'S IT,
SO IF WE WANT HORSES,
WE'VE GOT TO PAY
THEIR PRICES...AND LIKE IT.
TROOP, COLUMN LEFT!
RANDALL!
ROUND OUT THAT HERD,
AND LET'S MAKE A START
FOR BATUM.
IT'S 60 MILES TO BATUM.
WE HAND THE HERD
OVER TO THE CAPTAIN
OF THE TRANSPORT FLEET THERE
AND THEN BACK TO INDIA!
THAT'S NOTHING TO BE
SO CHIRPY ABOUT.
YOU'RE DOOMED
TO BE MARRIED SOON,
YOU KNOW.
A MORE PLEASANT DOOM
NEVER FACED
ONE OF THE QUEEN'S MEN.
THIS SICK SENTIMENT.
YOU OUGHT TO BE
DRUMMED OUT OF THE SERVICE
FOR THAT REMARK.
[MAN]
DON'T MIND
HIM, SIR.
I DON'T.
WHERE'D YOU COME FROM?
BE GLAD YOU CAME ALONG
FOR THE RIDE.
IT'S THE SORT OF THING
YOU'D ENJOY--
A REAL PICNIC
WITH EVERYTHING
BUT RED ANTS,
AND I'D RATHER HOPED
FOR SOME ACTION.
[GUNSHOT]
TROOP, HALT!
HERE'S YOUR ACTION.
RANDALL, STAMPEDE THE HERD
THROUGH THAT GORGE.
TROOP, WHEEL MARCH.
GALLOP!
TROOP, DISMOUNT!
TAKE COVER!
GET IN YOUR POSITIONS!
INDEPENDENT FIRE
AS SOON AS YOU'RE UNDER COVER!
[SCREAMING]
WE'RE OUTNUMBERED.
WE CAN'T HOLD ON
MUCH LONGER.
RANDALL, TAKE COMMAND.
IF I'M NOT BACK IN AN HOUR,
TRY TO BREAK THROUGH FOR BATUM.
KEEP FIRING
AS LONG AS YOU CAN.
WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO?
NEVER MIND ABOUT ME.
YOU DO AS I TELL YOU.
HUDSON,
YOU AND BURKE
FOLLOW ME.
YES, SIR.
HERE. FASTEN THIS
TO YOUR POMMEL.
NOW, RIDE OFF DOWN THERE
AND DRAG THIS BUSH
BEHIND YOU.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
TRY TO RAISE ENOUGH DUST
TO MAKE THEM THINK
HALF THE BRITISH ARMY'S
COMING UP TO RELIEVE US.
HURRY!
[YELLING IN
FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
[YELLING IN
FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
[YELLING IN
FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
[YELLING IN
FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
[YELLING IN
FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
ALL RIGHT, BOYS.
FOLD UP YOUR ARMY.
[MEN]
THEY'RE RUNNING!
[MEN REJOICING]
[MAN]
PEARSON, PEARSON,
THERE'S SOMETHING
TO TELL YOUR
GRANDCHILDREN ABOUT
IF YOU
LIVE LONG ENOUGH.
[ALL TALKING AT ONCE]
THERE'S A BAD FELLOW!
IT'S MY TURN.
LET ME
HAVE A SHOT
AT HIM.
WAIT TILL HE GETS
ROUND THE ROCK.
HOLD IT. WAIT.
[GUNSHOT]
CAPTAIN VICKERS!
GEOFFREY, AM I
SEEING THINGS?
WHAT HAPPENED?
THEY THINK THERE'S
A RELIEF FORCE
COMING UP
TO SUPPORT US.
I'M TERRIBLY SORRY,
SIR.
THANK HEAVEN
I MISSED YOU.
YEAH. LUCKY
FOR ME YOU WERE
AIMING AT ME.
GOOD MORNING,
GENTLEMEN.
I'M MORE THAN PLEASED
WITH THE BRILLIANT SUCCESS
OF YOUR EXPEDITION.
CONGRATULATIONS,
MAJOR VICKERS.
MAJOR? WHY,
THANK YOU, SIR.
I HAVEN'T SEEN IT
IN ORDERS YET.
YOU WILL TOMORROW.
CONGRATULATIONS,
CAPTAIN RANDALL.
THANK YOU, SIR.
SHALL I SEE IT
IN ORDERS, TOO, SIR?
YES, OF COURSE.
SIR.
I'M AFRAID YOU'LL HAVE
TO WAIT A BIT, PEARSON,
BUT GOOD WORK
ALL THE SAME.
NOW, WHAT DO YOU ALL SAY
ABOUT GOING BACK
TO CHUKOTI?
WE NEED
SEASONED OFFICERS
UP THERE.
I WOULD LIKE IT IMMENSELY,
PERSONALLY, SIR.
HE'S GOING TO BE
MARRIED SOON, SIR.
SO I UNDERSTAND.
WELL, WE'LL SEE
WHAT WE CAN DO
ABOUT GETTING YOU
AN EXTENDED LEAVE
LATER ON.
WHY,
THANK YOU, SIR.
WELL, THANK YOU,
GENTLEMEN.
PERRY.
[PERRY]
YOU SENT FOR ME, SIR?
PERRY, YES. SIT DOWN.
MAKE YOURSELF COMFORTABLE,
WON'T YOU?
THANK YOU, SIR.
THE VICKERS ARE
AN OLD ARMY FAMILY.
YES, SIR.
I KNEW YOUR FATHER
AT ZANDA, PERRY.
YOU AND YOUR BROTHER
GEOFFREY HAVE COME
ALONG ADMIRABLY,
THOUGH AS BROTHERS,
I EXPECT YOU'VE HAD
YOUR LITTLE DIFFERENCES.
HMM?
YOU KNOW,
BROTHERS RARELY AVOID
THESE LITTLE THINGS...
BUT THEY'RE
USUALLY TRIFLES.
TRIFLES, SIR?
CERTAINLY.
DON'T YOU THINK SO?
WELL, THAT IS, IT'S
RATHER DIFFICULT
TO EXPLAIN,
BUT, DON'T YOU
THINK, SIR,
WE'RE ENTITLED
TO SETTLE
OUR OWN PROBLEMS
IN OUR OWN WAY?
YES. YES, PERHAPS SO.
NOW, GOVERNOR GENERAL
DELHAUSSY
REQUIRES THE PRESENCE
OF A POLITICAL MAN
ON THE FRONTIER
TO HANDLE THE SURISTANI
SITUATION.
I'VE SELECTED YOU.
YOU MEAN I'M TO GO
UP TO CHUKOTI, SIR?
NO. YOU'LL BE
STATIONED AT LOHARA.
CHUKOTI WILL BE
THE SPEARHEAD OF ANY
POSSIBLE MILITARY MANEUVERS,
BUT YOUR DUTIES
WILL BE THOSE
OF AN OFFICIAL OBSERVER.
IS THAT FINAL, SIR?
I MEAN, THAT I'M
TO GO UP TO LOHARA?
FINAL. YOU'LL HAVE
SO MUCH WORK TO DO THERE
THAT YOU WON'T HAVE TIME
TO THINK OF ANYTHING ELSE.
YOU'LL LEAVE
WITH A CARAVAN
IN THE MORNING.
THAT'S ALL.
YES, SIR.
I UNDERSTAND, SIR.
PERRY. I'M SORRY
ABOUT THE WAY THINGS
HAVE GONE, OLD LAD.
ELSA CAN'T LOVE
BOTH OF US,
YOU KNOW.
I'M AWARE OF THAT.
WELL, THEN...
LOOK HERE, GEOFFREY.
WE MIGHT AS WELL
GET THIS THING SETTLED
ONCE AND FOR ALL.
WE'RE NOT FRIENDS,
SO WHY PRETEND WE ARE?
ALL THE CARDS
ARE STACKED ON YOUR SIDE--
OLD CAMBPELL'S FOR YOU,
THE FACT THAT YOU
GOT THERE FIRST,
EVERYTHING.
I'VE ONLY ONE CLAIM--
ELSA HAPPENS TO LOVE ME,
AND ONLY ME,
AND AS LONG
AS THAT'S TRUE,
I'M GOING TO FIGHT ANYONE.
PERRY, I KNOW
YOU'RE WRONG.
WE CAN'T LET
SOMETHING LIKE THIS
COME BETWEEN US NOW,
AND BESIDES, YOU--
I'LL GET OVER IT.
I KNOW.
WELL, GET THIS
INTO YOUR HEAD.
I'M OLD ENOUGH TO KNOW
MY OWN MIND AND ELSA'S.
I WOULDN'T
HANG ON TO ANYONE
WHO DIDN'T LOVE ME. I--
[MAN]
THIS IS WHERE WE
TURN OFF FOR CHUKOTI. VICKERS!
COMING.
PERRY, OLD LAD--
THERE'S NOTHING MORE
TO SAY.
[MAN]
TROOP, COLUMN LEFT!
[BUGLING]
[MAN SHOUTING ORDERS]
EYES LEFT.
HALT!
REPORTING OUR RETURN
FROM CALCUTTA, SIR.
GOOD, MAJOR VICKERS.
ANY CASUALTIES?
YES, SIR.
ONE MAN WOUNDED.
WE WERE FIRED ON
SEVERAL TIMES,
BUT WE EXPECTED THAT.
DID YOU RETURN FIRE?
NO, SIR.
I'M GLAD YOU DIDN'T.
SIR BENJAMIN'S ORDERS
ARE TO MAINTAIN PEACE.
PRETTY DIFFICULT ORDERS
TO FOLLOW, SIR,
PARTICULARLY WHEN
THEY'RE FIRING ON US.
YES. WHEN YOU'VE
BEEN SOLDIERING
AS LONG AS I HAVE,
YOU'LL UNDERSTAND
IT'S BEST TO FOLLOW
INSTRUCTIONS REGARDLESS.
YES, SIR.
BY THE WAY,
IT WOULD BE DISGRACEFUL
FOR AN OFFICER
TO APPEAR BEFORE HIS
COMMANDANT'S DAUGHTER
IN SUCH A CONDITION.
RUN ALONG
AND CLEAN UP
AND COME BACK
TO MY OFFICE.
YES, SIR.
TROOP,
FACE LEFT ABOUT!
WALK MARCH!
ASK MISS CAMPBELL
TO COME TO MY OFFICE
IMMEDIATELY.
HALT!
FALL OUT THE OFFICERS.
PREPARE TO DISMOUNT!
DISMOUNT!
DISMISSED.
CAPTAIN SAHIB!
PREMA!
UP YOU GO.
THANK YOU, SAHIB.
LOOK, I BROUGHT YOU BACK
A NEW SALUTE.
WATCH.
HOW DO YOU DO IT?
LIKE THIS.
TRY IT ON THE GENERAL.
WELL, MISS CAMPBELL
LEFT WITH THE FIRST PATROL
THIS MORNING, SIR.
CONFOUND IT!
WELL, UH, YES.
THAT'S ALL.
THAT'S ALL.
WHY DIDN'T ELSA
TELL ME OF THIS?
THAT GIRL'S
A COMPLETE MYSTERY
TO ME. OUTRAGEOUS!
SHE KNEW
PERFECTLY WELL YOU
WERE ARRIVING TODAY.
PARDON, SIR?
ELSA LEFT FOR LOHARA
THIS MORNING.
LADY WARRENTON
MIGHT BE ILL, SIR.
SHE MIGHT HAVE SENT FOR HER.
NOT THAT I'M AWARE OF,
AND WHAT IF SHE WERE?
THAT'S NO EXCUSE.
[LADY WARRENTON]
YOU DON'T MEAN TO TELL ME--
WELL, YOU MUST HAVE HAD
A LONG AND TIRESOME JOURNEY.
A NICE CUP OF HOT TEA
WILL REALLY REFRESH YOU,
MY DEAR.
I'LL NEVER FORGET MY
APPALLING HONEYMOON TRIP
WITH DARLING BENJI.
YOU REMEMBER, DEAR?
BENJI!
YES, DEAR? BE WITH YOU
IN A MINUTE, DEAR.
HERE'S SOME NICE COLD WATER
TO TAKE WITH YOUR PILL.
I THOUGHT I MIGHT
DRINK A LITTLE TOAST
TO OUR DELIGHTFUL GUEST.
KEEP ME AWAKE ALL NIGHT?
WELL, YOU'RE WRONG AGAIN.
I HOPE
YOU AND SIR BENJAMIN
DIDN'T MIND MY COMING
UNINVITED LIKE THIS.
CERTAINLY NOT.
DELIGHTED.
MIND?
WE'RE ENCHANTED.
BY THE WAY, HOW IS THAT
RAVISHINGLY HANDSOME
FIANCE OF YOURS?
YOUNG VICKERS.
DUE HERE TODAY.
NO, BENJI,
YOU'RE ALL MUDDLED.
ELSA IS ENGAGED
TO THE OTHER BROTHER,
GODFREY.
GEOFFREY, DEAR.
SOME CAKE?
NO, THANK YOU.
SO THE BROTHER IS COMING.
WELL, WELL, WELL.
THAT IS A COINCIDENCE.
MY DEAR, YOU REMEMBER
THE APPALLING BALL
IN CALCUTTA?
WELL, I WAS CONVINCED
THAT YOU AND HE WERE, UH...
SO TO SPEAK.
[SIR BENJAMIN]
PAY NO ATTENTION TO
MY WIFE, MISS CAMPBELL.
SHE HAS TWO OBSESSIONS
IN LIFE--
GIVING ME PILLS
AND SCANDALOUS INTRIGUE.
CAPTAIN VICKERS,
SAHIB.
THANK YOU.
LADY WARRENTON.
GLAD TO SEE YOU,
VICKERS.
SIR BENJAMIN.
ELSA! WHY,
THIS IS A SURPRISE.
HOW ARE YOU, PERRY?
[SIR BENJAMIN]
GOOD TRIP,
MY BOY?
DON'T BE ABSURD, BENJI.
THERE'S NO SUCH THING
AS A GOOD TRIP IN INDIA.
ONE EITHER TRAVELS IN
COMPARATIVE DISCOMFORT
OR IN COMPLETE DISCOMFORT.
MINE WAS COMPLETE.
YOU TWO CHILDREN
WANT TO BE ALONE, I KNOW.
YOU MUST TELL ELSA
ALL ABOUT GODFREY.
GEOFFREY, DEAR.
ALL ABOUT YOUR BROTHER,
THOUGH, WHY YOU'RE NOT
GREEN WITH JEALOUSY OF HIM
FOR ANNEXING THIS ADORABLE
CREATURE, I CAN'T IMAGINE.
COME, BENJI.
OH, PLEASE DON'T
DISTURB YOURSELF,
LADY WARRENTON.
ELSA AND I
WILL TAKE A STROLL.
SHALL WE?
YES.
NO, NO, NO.
NOT OUT THERE.
NOT ON THE VERANDA.
THERE. IN
THE SUMMER HOUSE...
WHERE THE BIRDS
ARE SINGING
AND THE FLOWERS
ARE BURGEONING.
ACROSS THE VERANDA
AND DOWN THE WALK.
REALLY, OCTAVIA.
YOUR CONSTANT INNUENDOS
ARE INTOLERABLE.
YOU FULLY EMBARRASSED
YOUNG VICKERS
AND THE CAMPBELL GIRL,
NOT TO MENTION ME.
WHY CAN'T YOU RESIST
POKING YOUR NOSE
INTO OTHER PEOPLE'S
PRIVATE AFFAIRS?
IS NOTHING SACRED
TO YOU?
YES, BENJI, DEAR.
YOUR LIVER.
IT'S WONDERFUL OF YOU
TO COME HERE LIKE THIS.
WHEN I SAW YOU JUST NOW,
I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT
POSSIBLE.
WHY DID YOU
TAKE SUCH A RISK?
I HAD TO.
I'VE TRIED TO FORCE MYSELF
TO FORGET YOU.
I'VE EVEN TRIED
TO HATE YOU,
BUT I LOVE YOU.
I ALWAYS HAVE,
AND I ALWAYS SHALL.
DARLING.
POOR FATHER.
YOU SEE, HE'S RIGHT
FROM HIS POINT OF VIEW.
HE MADE ME PROMISE
TO TRY TO GET OVER IT.
I DID TRY...
FOR THREE MONTHS,
BUT I FAILED,
SO I THREW AWAY
ALL COMMON SENSE
AND CAME HERE TO YOU
TO MAKE SURE THAT--
THAT YOU'RE READY
TO FACE EVERYTHING WITH ME.
MY LOVE FOR YOU
IS EVEN STRONGER,
MORE A PART OF ME
THAN EVER.
I WAS SURE OF IT.
TOMORROW I MUST GO
BACK TO CHUKOTI
AND TELL
FATHER AND GEOFFREY
THAT WHATEVER HAPPINESS
THERE IS IN ME TO GIVE
MUST BE GIVEN TO YOU.
PARADES, LEFT!
TROOP, HALT!
[BUGLING]
STABLES. COMING?
PARADE LEFT,
COLUMN LEFT. MARCH!
REPORT THE RETURN
OF THE CONVOY, SIR.
VERY GOOD.
SIR BENJAMIN'S
COMPLIMENTS, SIR.
YOU'VE HAD A SCRAP.
WE WERE FIRED UPON
BY THE SURISTANIS
IN KOHRUD PASS.
WELL, YOU HAD
YOUR ORDERS?
YES, SIR. MY PATROL
WITHDREW IN GOOD ORDER,
BUT WE LOST A MAN--
LANCER WENTWORTH.
WENTWORTH?
THAT'S ALL, BARCLAY.
ANYTHING ELSE?
WELL, SIR. THE KHAN--
THAT IS, IF I MAY...
YES, OF COURSE.
GO ON.
WELL, YOU SEE, SIR, WE RAN
ACROSS A CARAVAN COMING
DOWN FROM THE PASS.
THERE WAS A HINDU MERCHANT.
HE'D JUST BEEN
TO VISIT THE SURISTANIS,
AND HE HAS IT ON GOOD AUTHORITY
THAT THE SURISTANIS ARE
PREPARING FOR AN ATTACK.
AN ATTACK?
YES, SIR.
ON CHUKOTI.
OH, COME,
COME, NOW, BARCLAY.
THE KHAN WOULDN'T DARE.
YOU MUST BE MISTAKEN.
THAT'S ALL.
YES, SIR.
SOLDIERS...
OLD WOMEN, THAT'S WHAT.
I FEEL
THAT BARCLAY'S
INFORMATION
IS ACCURATE, SIR.
WHAT, YOU ALSO?
ALL RIGHT.
PRESUMING IT IS.
WHY THIS GARRISON?
WHY CHUKOTI?
ANSWER ME THAT, VICKERS.
THE KHAN'S
WISE ENOUGH
TO KNOW, SIR,
THAT AN ATTACK
ON CHUKOTI NOW
WILL IGNITE
THE ENTIRE FRONTIER.
WHY,
THE INFERNAL SCOUNDREL.
THEN HE MUST KNOW
THE HOME GOVERNMENT'S
FEELINGS ABOUT A BORDER WAR.
THAT'S IT EXACTLY, SIR.
ALSO THE FACT THAT
ENGLAND'S ABOUT TO
GO TO WAR WITH RUSSIA.
ATTACK NOW, SIR.
STRIKE THE FIRST BLOW,
AND YOU'LL CRUSH HIM.
VICKERS,
YOU WILL PARADE YOUR MEN
IN FULL MARCHING ORDER,
READY TO MOVE OFF
AT ONCE.
YES, SIR.
[BUGLING]
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
GOOD-BYE, MARY.
COMPANY...MARCH!
TROOPS ARE READY
TO MOVE OFF, SIR.
[CAMPBELL]
STAND AT EASE, GENTLEMEN.
I HAVE RECEIVED
THE FOLLOWING FROM
GENERAL HEADQUARTERS--
"TO THE OFFICER
COMMANDING CHUKOTI
GARRISON,
"UPON RECEIPT
OF THIS ORDER,
"YOU WILL DISPATCH
ALL AVAILABLE MEN
UNDER YOUR COMMAND
TO BRIGADE HEADQUARTERS,
LOHARA, TO TAKE PART
IN MANEUVERS."
MANEUVERS?
AT THIS TIME, SIR?
SIR BENJAMIN'S ORDERS, VICKERS.
HE KNOWS MORE OF THE SITUATION
THAN WE DO.
MAJOR JOWETT,
YOU WILL BE IN COMMAND
OF THE TROOPS.
CAPTAIN CARY,
CORNET GORDON,
CORNET BARCLAY
WILL GO WITH YOU.
THE REST OF YOU
WILL REMAIN
IN THE GARRISON.
THOSE ARE MY ORDERS
FROM SIR BENJAMIN.
THAT'S ALL, GENTLEMEN.
BEG YOUR PARDON,
SIR.
YES. WHAT IS IT?
SENDING THE MEN OFF
TO LOHARA
ON MANEUVERS NOW
LEAVES US WITH
HARDLY ONE COMPANY
OF INFANTRY HERE.
OBVIOUSLY, IT'S
STRATEGIC TO PUT ON
A DISPLAY OF FORCE
FOR THE SURISTANI
TRIBES.
MORE EFFECTIVE
THAN BULLETS.
BUT THAT LEAVES
CHUKOTI ALMOST
ENTIRELY UNDEFENDED.
BOLDNESS. THAT, MY BOY,
IS THE ESSENCE
OF STRATEGY.
BUT THE WOMEN
AND CHILDREN, SIR.
JOWETT'S WIFE
AND CHILD, ELSA,
THE SEPOYS'
FAMILIES.
NOTHING TO WORRY
ABOUT.
WE HAVE PLENTY OF MEN
LEFT HERE
TO DEFEND THEM.
WE HAVEN'T
ENOUGH MEN LEFT.
YOU CAN'T TAKE--
MAJOR VICKERS,
YOU'VE HAD YOUR ORDERS.
I'VE HAD MINE.
THAT'S ALL.
YES, SIR.
PARADE RIGHT!
PARADE RIGHT!
PARADE RIGHT!
PARADE RIGHT!
FORWARD MARCH!
ELSA.
OH, IT'S YOU,
GEOFFREY.
I'M SORRY.
I DIDN'T MEAN
TO STARTLE YOU.
YOU LOOKED
VERY FAR AWAY
JUST THEN.
WHAT WERE YOU
THINKING OF?
OF A PEACEFUL
COUNTRYSIDE,
OF SOFT GREEN DOWNS
ROLLING TO A BLUE SEA.
I KNOW. ENGLAND.
NO HOT, BURNING SUN.
NO ETERNAL TREACHERY
WAITING
FOR THE UNKNOWN.
ENGLAND.
IN EARLY SPRINGTIME.
ASCOT, CRICKET,
PUNTING
ON THE THAMES.
WE'LL SEE ALL THAT
TOGETHER ONE DAY.
JUST NOW IT...
SEEMS RATHER LIKE
AN INTANGIBLE DREAM.
LITTLE LIKE YOU,
ELSA.
YOU SEE...
I WAS RATHER HOPING
YOU'D BE HERE
WHEN I GOT BACK.
I WAS AT LOHARA.
YES, I KNOW.
YOUR FATHER TOLD ME.
THERE WAS SOMETHING
I HAD TO FIND OUT,
SOMETHING
I HAD TO BE SURE OF
BEFORE I SAW YOU.
YOU FOUND OUT?
YES.
GEOFFREY, YOU WANT
TO MAKE ME HAPPY?
MORE THAN ANYTHING
ELSE IN THE WORLD.
THEN YOU MUST KNOW
EVERYTHING.
I CAME
BACK FROM LOHARA
DETERMINED TO
TELL YOU THAT--
[BULLET RICOCHETS]
MAJOR SAHIB!
MAJOR SAHIB!
MAJOR SAHIB!
TOWER GUARD SHOT!
SURISTANI.
MAJOR SAHIB.
SOUND THE ALARM!
TURN OUT THE GUARD
DOUBLE QUICK!
VICKERS,
WHAT'S HAPPENING?
WE'RE BEING
ATTACKED, SIR.
SURISTANI?
YES, SIR.
CONCENTRATE
YOUR STRENGTH
ON THE MAIN GATE.
SEND 15 MEN
TO THE EAST WALL.
ORDERLY!
OPEN FIRE AS SOON AS
YOU'RE WITHIN RANGE!
CORNET!
YES, SIR!
TAKE 15 MEN
AND MOUNT
THE EAST WALL!
[BABY CRYING]
RAPID FIRE!
WE'RE LOSING
TOO MANY MEN, SIR!
YES. WE'RE HOPELESSLY
OUTNUMBERED.
WE'D BETTER ABANDON
THE WALL BEFORE
IT'S TOO LATE.
THE BARRACKS, SIR.
WE CAN HOLD THEM OFF
FROM THERE
AND GET THEM AS
THEY COME OVER THE WALL.
GIVE ORDERS
TO ABANDON THE WALL.
BUGLER, SOUND THE RETREAT.
TAKE COVER IN THE BARRACKS, MEN!
TAKE COVER IN THE BARRACKS!
QUICK, MEN!
GET ALL YOUR WOUNDED
TO THE MEDICAL OFFICER!
GET THE DOORS
AND WINDOWS!
[GEOFFREY]
BARRICADE THE DOORS
AND WINDOWS!
ELSA, GET ALL
THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN
AWAY FROM THE LINE
OF THE WINDOWS, QUICK.
[WOMAN SHOUTS]
MAMA!
RANDALL!
YES, HERE.
TAKE SIX MEN
AND REINFORCE THE REAR.
ISSUE MORE AMMUNITION
ALL AROUND. QUICK.
YES, SIR. FIRST SIX MEN,
FOLLOW ME.
THIS WAY. HURRY!
HOLD THESE WINDOWS
AND COVER AN ATTACK
FROM THE STABLES.
MAKE EVERY SHOT TELL,
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
AMMUNITIONEER,
READY TO INTERCHANGE RIFLES.
VICKERS,
HOW MUCH AMMUNITION
HAVE WE LEFT?
PLENTY, SIR.
THAT'S THE LEAST
OF OUR TROUBLES.
IT'S WATER THAT'S
THE MAIN PROBLEM, SIR.
WATER AND THIS HEAT.
WE'VE GOT TO REACH
JOWETT AT LOHARA.
SOMEONE'S GOT TO
GET THROUGH TO THEM.
NOW IS YOUR CHANCE.
THE MOON'S GOING
BEHIND SOME CLOUDS.
NOW, DON'T FORGET.
WHEN YOU REACH
THE RIVER,
CUT A NATIVE BOAT
LOOSE,
AND THE CURRENT
WILL CARRY YOU DOWN
TO LOHARA.
THAT'S
EASY ENOUGH, SIR.
I'LL HAVE THE TROOPS
BACK IN NO TIME.
THAT'S THE SPIRIT.
NOW, WITH
ANY LUCK AT ALL,
YOU SHOULD GET OVER.
THERE'S
VERY FEW MARKSMEN
HOLDING THE WALL.
LOOKS PRETTY CLEAR.
YES.
GEOFFREY, LOOK.
YOU WOULDN'T MIND
GIVING THIS
TO MY FAMILY
JUST IN CASE?
LOOKS LIKE
A PRETTY CHEAP ONE.
DOES IT GO?
IF YOU WIND IT UP.
YOU'RE AN IDIOT.
ALL RIGHT.
I'LL GIVE IT BACK
TO YOU TOMORROW.
THANKS, OLD PAL.
GOOD LUCK.
COME, MY BOY.
OVER YOU GO.
GOD BE WITH YOU.
THANK YOU, SIR.
[GEOFFREY]
YOU READY?
YEAH.
HE'S OVER THE WALL.
IN THIS CHANGING MOON,
THE KHAN WON'T DARE
TO MAKE ANOTHER ATTACK.
THANK GOD FOR HIS
EVERLASTING MERCY.
YOU LOOK
AS THOUGH
YOU COULD DO
WITH
A FEW HOURS'
SLEEP, SIR.
OH, YES.
PERHAPS YOU'RE RIGHT.
SUN'S UP, SIR.
YES.
WE CAN'T HOLD OUT
MUCH LONGER, SIR.
[MAN]
MAJOR VICKERS, SIR. LOOK.
THEY'RE GONE.
THEY'RE GONE, SIR.
[GUNSHOT]
PEARSON,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
ARE YOU MAD?
BUT DON'T YOU
SEE THEM?
THEY'RE COMING
OVER THE WALL.
THEY'RE
COMING THROUGH
THE COMPOUND.
I CAN'T STOP THEM.
SHUT UP! STOP!
I--I--I--
SHUT UP!
THAT'S ALL RIGHT,
OLD FELLA.
PULL YOURSELF
TOGETHER.
I'M SORRY, SIR.
[SOBS]
THE WALLS ARE
ALL DESERTED, SIR.
THAT'S VERY STRANGE.
POSSIBLY SOME SORT
OF A TRICK.
RUN UPSTAIRS
AND LOOK AROUND
CAREFULLY.
WHITE FLAG, SIR.
WHAT?
THEY'RE COMING
TOWARDS US NOW
OVER THE HILL.
WHAT THE DEVIL
ARE THEY UP TO NOW?
WE'LL SOON SEE.
REMOVE THE BARRICADE.
OPEN THAT DOOR.
HIS HIGHNESS,
SURAT KHAN,
AMIR OF SURISTAN,
SENDS GREETINGS
TO HIS EXCELLENCY
THE COMMANDANT
OF CHUKOTI
AND HUMBLY
PROPOSES A TRUCE,
WITH A REQUEST
THAT YOU WILL SEND
MAJOR VICKERS
TO DISCUSS
THE TERMS.
EXCELLENT.
HE'S PROBABLY MISSED
A BOAT FROM ITS MOORINGS
AND SUSPECTS OUR MAN
GOT THROUGH
AND IS READY
TO TREAT WITH US.
I'D BETTER GO, SIR.
YES, OF COURSE.
WE ACCEPT HIS HIGHNESS'
SUGGESTION
ONLY ON THE CONDITION
THAT WE HOLD YOU
AS HOSTAGE
PENDING MAJOR VICKERS'
SAFE RETURN.
I'M SURE HIS HIGHNESS
WILL BE GRACIOUSLY
PLEASED
AND WILL UNDERSTAND
YOUR NATURAL CAUTION.
VERY WELL.
YOU'LL ACCOMPANY ME
AS ORDERLY.
YES, SIR.
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
I WELCOME YOU,
MAJOR VICKERS.
MAY THE GODS
OF COURAGE AND WISDOM
CONTINUE TO BESTOW
THEIR BLESSINGS ON YOU.
YOUR HIGHNESS,
I MUST SUGGEST
YOU COME STRAIGHT
TO THE POINT.
REALLY?
YOU PROBABLY KNOW
BY NOW THAT WORD
HAS REACHED LOHARA,
AND THE ENTIRE
BRIGADE'S
ON ITS WAY HERE.
HOW INTERESTING.
OH, IT PAINS ME
DEEPLY
TO HAVE TO DISILLUSION
YOU ON THAT SCORE.
IF IT'S THAT SEPOY
YOU MEAN--
YES.
CAPTAIN RANDALL.
OH, SO IT WAS
CAPTAIN RANDALL
WHO SO IMPRUDENTLY
ATTEMPTED TO PENETRATE
THE LINES.
POOR FELLOW.
HE PAID THE PENALTY
FOR HIS FOOLISHNESS.
HE'S...HE'S DEAD?
OH, MY FRIEND,
LIFE IS SWEET AND DEAR
WHEN ONE CANNOT HAVE IT.
THAT'S WHY I SENT
FOR YOU.
I'M OFFERING YOU
YOUR LIFE.
MY LIFE. WHY?
YOU SAVED MINE,
AND I SHALL NEVER
FORGET IT.
YOU WILL BE GIVEN
A HORSE AND SAFE CONDUCT--
YOUR HIGHNESS,
UP TILL NOW
THE HOME GOVERNMENT
HAS CHOSEN
TO DISREGARD
SUNDRY UNFRIENDLY
ACTS OF YOURS.
BY WITHDRAWING
YOUR FORCES NOW,
YOU'LL BE MAKING
A FRIENDLY GESTURE
WHICH WILL ALMOST
CERTAINLY LEAD
TO THE REOPENING
OF NEGOTIATIONS
IN CALCUTTA.
YOU'RE NOT FIGHTING
A SINGLE OUTPOST.
YOU'RE FIGHTING
THE ENTIRE
BRITISH ARMY.
YOUR LOGIC,
MY DEAR MAJOR,
IS OVERWHELMING.
NO, MY FRIEND.
I DO NOT THINK
YOU SERIOUSLY BELIEVE
THAT I'LL ACCEPT
YOUR OPTIMISTIC
SUGGESTIONS.
AFTER ALL, HAVE YOU
NOT AN ENGLISH PROVERB
TO THE EFFECT
THAT POSSESSION
IS 9/10 OF THE LAW?
THEN I TAKE IT
THERE'S NOTHING MORE
TO BE SAID.
ON THE CONTRARY,
IF WE ARE OPEN
AND HONEST
WITH ONE ANOTHER,
THIS MATTER CAN BE
SETTLED REASONABLY.
ANY SUGGESTION
YOU MAKE MUST
GUARANTEE THE SAFETY
OF THE WOMEN
AND CHILDREN.
THEN THE OBVIOUS
SOLUTION WOULD BE
AN EVACUATION.
EVACUATION?
YOU MEAN SURRENDER?
HARDLY. I AM
PERFECTLY WILLING
TO GRANT THE GARRISON
A SAFE ESCORT
TO LOHARA.
WHY, I'VE EVERY
REASON TO SUPPOSE
THAT WILL BE
PERFECTLY
SATISFACTORY.
WHEN I WENT TO SCHOOL
IN ENGLAND,
I LEARNED YOUR CHARMING
CUSTOM OF SHAKING HANDS,
SIGNIFYING THE COMPLETION
OF A BARGAIN
BETWEEN TWO GENTLEMEN.
OF COURSE, THE GARRISON
WILL HAVE TO LAY DOWN
ITS ARMS.
WHAT? BUT WHY?
AS A FRIENDLY GESTURE.
THAT'S UTTERLY
IMPOSSIBLE.
IT PLACES US
ENTIRELY
AT YOUR MERCY.
AHEM. WE UNDERSTAND
THEIR FEELINGS,
YOUR HIGHNESS.
VERY WELL, THEN.
WITH ARMS.
I'M SORRY.
I WON'T AGREE
TO YOUR TERMS
UNDER ANY CONDITIONS
WHATEVER.
TAKE MY OFFER
TO YOUR COMMANDANT.
THE DECISION IS HIS.
IF MY TERMS
ARE ACCEPTABLE,
INSTRUCT YOUR COLONEL
TO RAISE THE WHITE FLAG.
YOU SHOULD KNOW
THE BRITISH
NEVER SURRENDER,
YET THEIR GUNS WILL
BE USELESS TO THEM,
IF I MAY ADVISE
YOUR HIGHNESS.
I SUSPECTED YOU HAD
A PLAN.
PRECISELY.
IF COLONEL CAMPBELL
ACCEPTS OUR TERMS--
AND HE WOULD BE
EXCEEDINGLY UNWISE
NOT TO--
IT WOULD BE
VERY SIMPLE.
I WISH YOU'D
THINK IT OVER
AGAIN, SIR.
I FEEL
WE'RE MAKING
A GRAVE MISTAKE
IN ACCEPTING
THE KHAN'S TERMS.
IT PUTS US ENTIRELY
AT HIS MERCY.
WELL, WE'RE PRACTICALLY
AT HIS MERCY ALREADY.
I'M SURE YOU'RE
QUITE MISTAKEN
IN YOUR SUSPICIONS.
CAN YOU GIVE ME
ANY TANGIBLE REASON?
NO, SIR, EXCEPT
THAT THEY OFFERED ME
A HORSE
AND A SAFE CONDUCT
FOR MYSELF ONLY.
NO, I SEE NO REASON
TO MISTRUST HIM.
BESIDES,
I'VE GOT TO THINK OF
THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN.
THAT'S JUST IT, SIR.
WE CAN'T TRUST HIM.
WELL, WE'VE GOT TO
GO THROUGH WITH IT.
ALL RIGHT, GET TO THE FIRST
AND SECOND BOAT THERE.
[SPEAKING
FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
GET THE PEOPLE
LOADED INTO THE BOATS
AS SOON AS YOU CAN,
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
AND YOU TAKE
THE LEADING BOAT
TO LOHARA.
PUT THAT STRETCHER
ON THE RAFT THERE.
[SPEAKING
FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
[BABY CRIES]
CAREFUL! DON'T
OVERLOAD THAT BOAT!
[SPEAKING
FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
[SCREAMING]
OUT OF THE BOATS.
QUICKLY, NOW!
MASSACRE!
HE'S SAFE.
MY DEBT TO MAJOR VICKERS
IS PAID.
[SPEAKING
FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
DRIVE THE REST OF THEM
BACK INTO THE GARRISON!
DOES IT FEEL
BETTER NOW?
YES, MUCH.
THANK YOU.
WE SHOULDN'T
HAVE TRUSTED HIM.
THOSE POOR
LITTLE KIDS.
HORRIBLE.
WHAT'S GOING
TO HAPPEN TO THEM?
HE CAN'T MURDER
THEM ALL.
NO. THAT WOULD
BE TOO MUCH,
EVEN FOR
THE KHAN.
HE'LL HOLD THEM
AS HOSTAGES.
THAT'S WHY WE'VE
GOT TO GET TO
LOHARA FOR HELP.
IT'S
OUR ONLY HOPE.
LOOK.
IT'S OUR CHANCE.
"...BEEN OUR REFUGE
FROM ONE GENERATION TO ANOTHER.
"THOU TURNEST MEN
TO DESTRUCTION.
AGAIN THOU SAYEST, COME AGAIN,
YE CHILDREN OF MEN..."
[MAN SPEAKING
FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
"THE DAYS OF OUR AGE
ARE 3 SCORE YEARS AND 10,
"AND THOUGH MEN BE SO STRONG
"THAT THEY COME
TO FOURSCORE YEARS,
"YET IS THEIR STRENGTH
THEN BUT LABOR AND SORROW,

AND WE ARE GONE.
TURN THEE AGAIN, O LORD..."
[SHOUTING
IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
MAJOR VICKERS!
WHAT ON EARTH
ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT?
WELL, WHERE
DID THIS HAPPEN?
JUST NOW, SIR,
DOWN BY THE RIVER
AT THE NORTH GATE.
WHAT'S THE MEANING
OF ALL THIS?
MISS CAMPBELL!
GEOFFREY!
ALI!
TELL LADY WARRENTON
MISS CAMPBELL
NEEDS HER HELP AT ONCE.
MY DEAR.
GO WITH CATARO.
SHE'LL TAKE YOU TO
MY WIFE AT ONCE.
GEOFFREY, MY BOY,
THIS IS TERRIBLE.
HOW ON EARTH
DID IT HAPPEN?
CHUKOTI, SIR.
THE SURISTANIS
ATTACKED.
HOT WATER AND CLOTHES.
GET SMELLING SALTS.
MY POOR, POOR CHILD!
I THOUGHT
THE BEST THING
WE COULD DO
WOULD BE TO TRY
AND REACH HERE
FOR HELP.
CHANCES ARE, WE WILL
GET THERE IN TIME?
YES, IF WE HURRY.
CAPTAIN BARNES.
REQUEST MAJOR JOWETT
TO REPORT TO ME
AT ONCE
AND SOUND ASSEMBLY.
VERY GOOD, SIR.
THE KHAN MUST BE
HOLDING THE WOMEN
AND CHILDREN.
YES, AS HOSTAGES,
OF COURSE.
WE'VE NO TIME
TO SPARE.
PACK THE SEPOYS
IN THEIR OWN
TRANSPORT WAGONS.
WE'LL BRING THEM
ALONG WITH US.
GEOFFREY, YOU GET
YOUR ARM ATTENDED TO
AT ONCE.
I'LL BE WITH YOU
IN A MINUTE.
DO YOU MIND
IF I COME ALONG?
NO, OLD LAD.
WE'LL NEED YOU.
HALT!
THAT'S STRANGE!
THE WHITE FLAG'S
STILL FLYING.
THERE ARE NO
SENTRIES ABOUT.
SHOWS EVERY SIGN
OF BEING DESERTED.
WHAT DO YOU
MAKE OF IT?
WHO KNOWS, SIR?
MAJOR JOWETT?
TAKE FORWARD A DETAIL
IN SKIRMISHING ORDER.
VERY GOOD, SIR.
THE LAST SIX SECTIONS
DISMOUNT
AND ADVANCE
IN SKIRMISHING ORDER!
I WONDER IF
THIS IS ANOTHER OF
THE KHAN'S TRICKS.
FIRE A SHOT.
[GUNSHOT]
NO SIGN OF LIFE.
TROOP, FORWARD. GALLOP!
OH, YARA! PREMA!
MEZANTI!
THERE SHE IS
ON THE STEPS, SIR.
NAN!
JOHN.
[CRYING]
YARA...
YARA, COME.
THEY'RE DEAD! THEY'RE ALL DEAD!
CAN'T YOU HEAR ME?
THEY'RE DEAD, I TELL YOU!
THEY'RE DEAD! GONE!
PREMA!
PREMA!
PREMA!
PREMA!
[SPEAKING
FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
PREMA.
MY LITTLE BOY'S
GUN.
HE WANTED A GUN
TO KILL SURISTANI.
SURISTANI KILL HIM.
PREMA, MY BABY.
DO YOU HEAR ME, PREMA?
PREMA!
COLONEL CAMPBELL,
SIR,
UP OVER THE WALL.
SO THAT'S WHY
THEY ABANDONED CHUKOTI.
WE'VE GOT TO FOLLOW
SURAT KHAN.
HE CAN'T BE FAR OFF.
IMPOSSIBLE.
THEY'RE MOUNTAIN FIGHTERS.
WE DON'T STAND A GHOST
OF A CHANCE AGAINST THEM
IN THE HILLS.
BUT WE CAN'T STAND HERE
DOING NOTHING!
BY HEAVEN, WE'LL NEVER REST
TILL HE'S BEEN MADE
TO PAY FOR THIS.
INDIA WILL BE TOO SMALL
TO HOLD HIM.
[MAN]
THESE BOOKS WANT TO BE STORED
AND THE CASES
MADE READY FOR TRANSPORT.
[MAN]
AND ALL THE OFFICIAL PAPERS
IN THIS BOX HERE.
YOU'LL REPORT
TO THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF
ON ARRIVAL AT BALAKLAVA.
GOOD LUCK, WATSON.
THANK YOU,
SIR.
MAJOR VICKERS,
SIR.
OH, GEOFFREY,
MY BOY.
REPLACEMENTS
FOR THE 27th HAVE
REPORTED FOR DUTY, SIR.
GOOD, THEN YOU'RE READY
TO EMBARK.
NEVER BEEN TO THE CRIMEA,
HAVE YOU, GEOFFREY?
THEY TELL ME IT'S
A PESTILENTIAL HOLE.
SEEMS VERY STRANGE
TO ME, SIR,
THAT THE WAR OFFICE
SHOULD BE SENDING
THE 27th TO SEBASTOPOL
TO FIGHT THE RUSSIANS.
POOR DEVILS,
HAVEN'T THEY BEEN
THROUGH ENOUGH ALREADY
AT CHUKOTI?
THE RUSSIANS?
PEOPLES DON'T WAGE WAR
AGAINST OTHER PEOPLES,
GEOFFREY.
ENGLAND IS FIGHTING
THE TYRANNY OF THE CZAR.
THE 27th LANCERS
ARE FIGHTING SURAT KHAN.
SURAT KHAN.
IT MAY INTEREST YOU
TO KNOW THAT AFTER
THE CHUKOTI MASSACRE,
SURAT KHAN FLED.
YES, I KNEW THAT, SIR.
INDIA WAS TOO HOT
TO HOLD HIM.
THE WAR DEPARTMENT
HAPPENS TO KNOW
THAT HE TOOK REFUGE
WITH THE RUSSIANS
AND IS WITH THEIR FORCES
AT SEBASTOPOL.
THIS IS WORTH KNOWING.
NOW YOU UNDERSTAND
WHY THE 27th LANCERS
HAVE BEEN ORDERED
TO SEBASTOPOL.
EVERY MAN WILL HAVE
A CHANCE FOR VINDICATION,
NOT ONLY FOR HIMSELF
AND FOR HIS REGIMENT,
BUT FOR EVERY SEPOY
IN INDIA.
NOW, YOU BETTER
GET ALONG, GEOFFREY.
YOU HAVEN'T TOO MUCH TIME
TO GET YOUR KIT READY.
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
YES. COME IN.
WHY, ELSA.
GEOFFREY,
I HAD TO COME.
WHY, WHAT'S
THE MATTER?
PERRY IS GONE.
GONE? WHAT
DO YOU MEAN?
TO THE CRIMEA.
HE WAS ORDERED
BACK TO HIS REGIMENT,
AND HE SAILED TWO DAYS AGO
WITH SIR BENJAMIN
ON THE FIRST TRANSPORT.
OH, GEOFFREY,
HE'LL BE KILLED.
I KNOW HE WILL.
YOU LOVE HIM,
DON'T YOU?
I DO.
I CAN'T HELP IT.
A LONG TIME?
I THINK,
SINCE THE FIRST DAY
I MET HIM.
I TRIED TO TELL YOU
THAT DAY WHEN I CAME
BACK FROM LOHARA.
YOU NEEDN'T EXPLAIN.
I THINK I'VE KNOW IT,
REALLY, IN MY HEART...
FOR SOME TIME.
I'M SORRY, GEOFFREY.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
WHY, IT CAN'T BE HELPED.
QUITE A NATURAL THING.
HE'S A GRAND LAD, ELSA.
HE'LL MAKE YOU VERY HAPPY.
YOU'LL BE GOING
BACK TO ENGLAND,
I SUPPOSE.
YES. I THINK SO.
OH, YOU'RE LUCKY.
WISH I COULD GO, TOO.
WELL, I MUST FINISH
THIS STUFF UP.
GEOFFREY, ARE YOU GOING
OUT TO THE CRIMEA, TOO?
YES. LEAVING
ALMOST IMMEDIATELY.
MAY I HELP YOU PACK?
OH, NO, THANKS.
I'VE BEEN GIVING MYSELF
A CRICK IN THE BACK
ALL THE MORNING AS IT IS.
ELSA, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT PERRY.
HE'LL BE ALL RIGHT.
I'LL SEE THAT HE IS.
GOOD-BYE...
AND BLESS YOU...
BOTH OF YOU.
GEOFFREY, WILL YOU
TAKE HIM A MESSAGE?
WHY, YES.
TELL HIM...
THAT I THINK HIS BROTHER...
IS THE FINEST MAN
I'VE EVER KNOWN.
SIR CHARLES
MACEFIELD'S
COMPLIMENTS
TO GENERAL SCOTT.
THERE ARE
NO NEW ORDERS.
SOON AS THE WAR
COUNCIL'S OVER,
I'LL NOTIFY HIM.
WE MUST ATTACK
SEBASTOPOL.
GENERAL CANROBERT'S ANXIETY
IS PERHAPS PROMPTED BY THE FACT
THAT OUR SUPPLIES
ARE RUNNING LOW.
LORD RAGLAN
UNDERSTANDS
PERFECTLY.
CAN'T YOU SEE,
LORD CARDIGAN,
THE BALTIC FLEET
IS USELESS?
THE TURKISH FLEET,
I REGRET TO SAY,
HAS BEEN DESTROYED
BY THE RUSSIANS
AT SINOPE.
THE RECENT STORM HAS WRECKED
NOT ONLY THE RUSSIAN FLEET,
BUT THE LARGEST
OF THE FRENCH MAN-OF-WAR.
YOU UNDERESTIMATE
OUR RESOURCES, GENERAL.
SEE FOR YOURSELF.
WE HAVE SEBASTOPOL
UNDER SIEGE,
AND OUR FORCES HAVE
THE RUSSIANS AT BAY,
SO TO SPEAK.
BESIDES, SO FAR,
NO REAL OPPORTUNITY
TO ATTACK SEBASTOPOL
HAS PRESENTED ITSELF.
ALL RIGHT, CAPTAIN.
I'LL MAKE A NOTE OF IT.
LORD RAGLAN
CAN'T BE DISTURBED
WHILE THE WAR COUNCIL'S
IN SESSION.
TAKE IT UP WITH
SIR CHARLES MACEFIELD.
YES, SIR.
WAIT.
ALL RIGHT. CARRY ON.
YES, SIR.
MY PLAN TO WITHDRAW
THE LIGHT BRIGADE
IS PERFECTLY CLEAR
TO ALL OF YOU GENTLEMEN.
BE GOOD ENOUGH TO ISSUE
THE ORDERS, SIR CHARLES.
VERY GOOD.
I THINK THAT'S ALL
WE HAVE TO DISCUSS.
SOME PAPERS
FOR YOUR SIGNATURE, SIR.
HMM?
WELL, THESE
ARE NOT IMPORTANT.
PRESENTLY WILL DO.
SIT DOWN.
I WANT YOU
TO TAKE A DISPATCH.
GENERAL HEADQUARTERS,
ARMY OF THE CRIMEA.
FROM HIS EXCELLENCY,
FIELD MARSHAL
THE EARL OF RAGLAN, K.C.B.,
COMMANDING...
THE MAJOR GENERAL
SIR BENJAMIN WARRENTON, K.C.B.,
NO. 1174.
ON RECEIPT OF THIS ORDER,
YOU WILL WITHDRAW
THE LIGHT BRIGADE
TO A POINT
3 KILOMETERS SOUTHWEST
OF ITS PRESENT POSITION...
BY ORDER.
LIGHT BRIGADE'S
MOVING BACK, SIR?
YES.
WHAT'S SURPRISING
ABOUT THAT?
VOLONOFF COMMANDS
THE RUSSIAN
ARTILLERY POSITION
ON THE HEIGHTS
ABOVE THE VALLEY
OF BALAKLAVA.
SURAT KHAN'S
WITH HIM.
WE KNOW THAT.
DON'T YOU THINK
THE MEN OF THE 27th,
THE MEN FROM CHUKOTI,
OUGHT TO BE GIVEN
A CHANCE TO ATTACK THEM?
I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL.
EVERY BRITISH SOLDIER
WOULD GIVE HIS LIFE
TO AVENGE
THE CHUKOTI MASSACRE,
BUT AT THIS MOMENT,
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
MAY NEVER BE
ANOTHER CHANCE, SIR.
YOU MUST KNOW
THAT THE RUSSIANS
HAVE THEIR STRONGEST BATTERIES
SITUATED ABOVE THE VALLEY.
IT WOULD TAKE
AT LEAST FIVE REGIMENTS
FOR THE ASSAULT.
OH, NO, VICKERS,
IT'S SUICIDE.
THAT VALLEY,
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES,
IS A VALLEY OF DEATH.
IT WOULD BE
WORTH IT, SIR.
600 MEN ATTACKING
THE RUSSIAN CENTER
WOULD KEEP
THE ENEMY OCCUPIED
WHILE THE COMBINED
FRENCH, TURKISH,
BRITISH FORCES
ATTACK SEBASTOPOL.
SEBASTOPOL TAKEN,
THE CZAR MUST SUE
FOR PEACE.
YES. THE ENTIRE
CRIMEA SITUATION
HINGES ON SEBASTOPOL,
BUT THIS IS NO TIME
TO CONSIDER PERSONAL
FEELINGS, VICKERS.
YOUR PLAN IS
ADMIRABLY DARING,
BUT THAT'S JUST IT.
IT'S TOO WILD.
NOW, I WANT YOU
TO DELIVER THIS ORDER
PERSONALLY
TO THE COMMANDER
OF THE LIGHT BRIGADE.
IS THAT CLEAR?
YES, SIR.
WHY, WHAT'S UP, VICKERS?
WHAT? NOTHING.
YOU DO LOOK RATHER ODD,
YOU KNOW.
CONFOUND YOU, BENTHAM.
MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS,
WILL YOU?
I'M SORRY. YES, SIR.
NOW, GENTLEMEN,
THESE BATTLES
ARE THE FINEST
OF TWO AND A HALF MONTHS.
WE'VE LOST HUNDREDS OF MEN,
APART FROM THOSE WHO DIED
FROM THE COLD AND SICKNESS.
IT IS, THEREFORE, IMPERATIVE
THAT UNLESS--
ORDERS FROM GENERAL
HEADQUARTERS, SIR.
YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
GENTLEMEN.
HIS EXCELLENCY'S
COMPLIMENTS.
THANK YOU.
WELL, HOW ARE THINGS
OVER AT HEADQUARTERS?
THEY'VE BEEN
PRETTY DULL HERE.
I BEG YOUR PARDON, SIR.
THAT'S FROM
THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF.
IT'S IMPORTANT.
WELL, SIR.
"UPON RECEIPT OF THIS ORDER,
THE LIGHT BRIGADE WILL ADVANCE
AND TAKE THE ENEMY POSITION
ON BALAKLAVA HEIGHTS."
IT'S COME AT LAST.
YOU EXPECTED IT?
FOR WEEKS, VICKERS.
FOR WEEKS.
SO YOU THOUGHT
GENERAL HEADQUARTERS WERE
THE ONLY ONES IN THE KNOW,
BUT I, TOO, KNEW
THAT SURAT KHAN
WAS WITH VOLONOFF
ON THE BALAKLAVA HEIGHTS.
THE 27th--
THE MEN KNOW, SIR?
CERTAINLY NOT.
THERE'D BE NO HOLDING THEM.
DO YOU MIND
IF I TELL THEM?
YOU MEAN
YOU'RE COMING WITH US?
OF COURSE.
IT'S MY REGIMENT.
BESIDES, THIS
IS MORE THAN JUST
A FIGHT FOR ME, SIR.
AND TO ME, TOO,
MY BOY.
DO YOU THINK THAT I'VE BEEN
ABLE TO SLEEP SINCE
THAT AWFUL DAY AT CHUKOTI?
AND NOW, AT LAST...
WOULD YOU MIND IF I
SPOKE TO MY BROTHER
HERE IN YOUR OFFICE?
CERTAINLY NOT.
ORDERLY...
GO TO
CAPTAIN VICKER'S BILLET
AND REQUEST HIM
TO COME HERE AT ONCE.
[MAN]
YES, SIR.
GENTLEMEN, WE HAVE
ACTION AT LAST.
COME WITH ME.
I TRUST ALL THE UNITS ARE
READY TO MOVE OUT AT ONCE.
OH, I--I THOUGHT
SIR BENJAMIN SENT FOR ME.
NO. I SENT FOR YOU.
I WANT YOU
TO TAKE THIS DISPATCH
TO GENERAL HEADQUARTERS
AND WAIT THERE
UNTIL FURTHER ORDERS.
WAIT AT
GENERAL HEADQUARTERS?
BUT I'VE HEARD
THE REGIMENT'S
MOVING FORWARD.
IF I HAVE TO WAIT
AT GENERAL HEADQUARTERS,
I'LL BE OUT OF THE FIGHT
ALTOGETHER.
YOU'LL DELIVER IT
PERSONALLY TO
SIR CHARLES MACEFIELD.
YOU UNDERSTAND?
I BELIEVE YOU'RE TRYING
TO KEEP ME OUT OF THIS
DELIBERATELY
BECAUSE OF ELSA.
NO. NO. ELSA'S GOT
NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS.
YOU'RE NOT
IN THE DIPLOMATIC
SERVICE NOW, YOU KNOW.
YOU'RE
WITH YOUR REGIMENT
AT THE FRONT.
YOU'LL OBEY MY ORDERS
IMMEDIATELY.
IF I REFUSE?
YOU'LL BE
COURT-MARTIALED.
I SEE--
DISGRACED EITHER WAY.
VERY WELL.
BUGLER, SOUND ASSEMBLY.
MEN OF THE 27th,
SURAT KHAN IS ON THE FIELD
WITH THE OPPOSING
RUSSIAN FORCES,
THE SAME SURAT KHAN
WHO MASSACRED
THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN
OF CHUKOTI.
OUR CHANCE HAS COME.
SHOW NO MERCY.
LET NO POWER ON EARTH
STOP YOU.
PROVE TO THE WORLD
THAT NO MAN CAN KILL
WOMEN AND CHILDREN
AND LIVE TO BOAST OF IT.
MEN OF THE 27th,
OUR OBJECTIVE IS SURAT KHAN!
FORWARD!
13th DRAGOONS,
PARADE LEFT!
WALK MARCH!
11th HUSSARS, FORWARD!
WALK MARCH!
[BUGLING]
CAPTAIN VICKERS,
SIR.
SHOW HIM IN.
DISPATCH, SIR.
PERSONAL. URGENT.
THANK YOU.
"THEY'LL ATTACK
THE BALAKLAVA
HEIGHTS."
THIS IS INSANITY.
GENERAL WARRENTON
IS ATTACKING
THE RUSSIAN ARTILLERY.
THEY'LL BE SLAUGHTERED,
ALL OF THEM.
ORDERLY!
I MUST ISSUE ORDERS
AT ONCE
FOR THE CHATEAU
D'AFRIQUE AND
THE HEBREE BRIGADE
TO SUPPORT THEM.
LET ME TAKE IT, SIR.
TAKE YOUR
FASTEST HORSE.
THE LIVES OF 600 MEN
ARE IN YOUR HANDS.
YES, SIR.
27th LANCERS,
FORWARD!
13th DRAGOONS,
FORWARD!
8th HUSSARS,
FORWARD!
7th HUSSARS,
FORWARD!
4th DRAGOONS,
FORWARD!
WALK MARCH!
YOUR EXCELLENCY,
THE BRITISH LIGHT
CAVALRY
ARE
ADVANCING AGAINST
OUR POSITION.
WE'LL CUT THEM DOWN
BEFORE THEY CROSS
THE VALLEY.
NO DOUBT.
INSTRUCT BATTERY
COMMANDERS IN
POSITIONS 37 AND 22
TO OPEN FIRE
IMMEDIATELY THEY
COME WITHIN RANGE.
YOUR EXCELLENCY.
[BUGLE SOUNDS]
THEY'RE DEPLOYING
THE CHARGE.
SEE FOR YOURSELF,
YOUR HIGHNESS.
WHAT A TACTICAL BLUNDER.
FOOLS. WHY, THEY'LL RIDE
INTO CERTAIN DEATH!
CHARGE!
THEY'RE CHARGING!
WHAT MADNESS.
[SHOUTING COMMANDS]
ONWARD, MEN! ONWARD!
WHY, THEY'VE BROKEN
THROUGH THE FIRST LINE
OF BATTERIES.
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE!
STEADY, MEN!
HOLD YOUR LINE!
ONWARD, MEN! ONWARD!
INSTRUCT COLONEL PLATTOV,
14th CALVARY, TO PREPARE
THE COUNTERATTACK.
YOUR EXCELLENCY.
STEADY, MEN! PRESS ON!
INSTRUCT 14th CALVARY
TO ATTACK!
YOUR EXCELLENCY.
GENTLEMEN,
EVERYONE BELIEVES
THE 600 WENT
TO THEIR DEATH
AT AN ORDER FROM ME.
CONFOUND IT, MAN.
IT MUST HAVE BEEN
A MISTAKE.
I'LL STAKE MY LIFE.
YOU NEVER ISSUED THAT ORDER.
IT WAS
A MAGNIFICENT BLUNDER.
THAT ONE INSANE CLASH
TURNED THE TIDE IN OUR FAVOR.
BUT THERE WAS
A MISUNDERSTANDING,
WASN'T THERE?
THE ORDERS YOU GAVE--
WERE RECEIVED
AND CARRIED OUT.
BELIEVE ME, GENTLEMEN,
I FULLY APPRECIATE
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING
TO DO FOR ME,
AND I'M SORRY I HAVE
TO DISAPPOINT YOU.
YOU'RE SHIELDING SOMEONE.
YOU'RE A BLASTED FOOL,
GOD BLESS YOU.

Feuer... eins!
Here, gentlemen, is where the Adelia was attacked and sunk.
You see, she was well into the danger zone.
Our proposed convoy system is simply this:
British destroyers will meet your troopships at this danger zone and convoy them to the french coast.
Neither the ship at sea nor the british destroyers will know until the last day when and where to meet.
Everything depends upon the secrecy of this rendezvous position.
It will be sent by wireless in code.
But our codes have been read before.
Well, it's the hope of every military cryptographer to invent an unbreakable code.
I've had 3 years' experience on the european front.
All that experience has gone into the making of the new code that I now offer you.
What if we send a munitions ship under this new system before we send any troops?
What do you hope to gain by that?
A test of Major Brennan's code.
If the munitions ship gets through without attack, our troopships will follow.
It's Greek to me.
Let's hope it'll be Greek to the enemy.
Was ist das?
The new code.
Hmm.
Hello, your excellency.
Mr. Gordon! I had no idea you were...
Anywhere but 6,000 Miles from here, huh?
Making trouble for diplomats who want to keep secrets.
Exactly.
When I was in Tokyo, you gave me many a sleepless night.
What now? Has your paper transferred you to Washington?
Oh, I'm no longer a newspaperman, your excellency.
Well! That'll be good news in many a capital.
Especially Berlin, sir, since by way of encouraging the enemy,
I've just been commissioned a Lieutenant in the United States Army.
Ah. Now you make me feel truly sorry for the Germans.
You'll find out what they intend to do before they know it themselves.
Oh, I'm afraid your imagination's running riot a little...
Your first failure as a prophet.
Oh, your excellency!
Thank you very much.
There we are.
Papa Gregory?
Hmm? Joel, my dear!
Hello, darling.
I want you to do a favor for me.
Hmm? Oh, so it was a bribe.
What do you want me to do, parade with your suffragettes?
Oh, you don't like that, do you?
I do not. You rule your men completely, and yet you're not satisfied.
You want it in the law books.
Now, don't you worry.
All I want you to do is to point out Boris Stronskoff for me.
Boris Stronskoff? He was standing right over...
Oh, there he is now with his back towards us.
I have a brilliant idea for my russian bazaar next week.
I'm going to ask him to sing for us.
I beg your pardon,
Monsieur Stronskoff.
Oh, Monsieur Stronskoff, you don't know me.
I'm Joel Carter.
Ah.
I can see that you're only used to the French.
In Russia, we hold the hand much longer.
Yes. Yes, of course, but I...
I just wanted to ask if you'd sing for us next week, Monsieur.
It's for charity, you know.
You said sing?
Just a few selections, of course.
It's for the Russo-American
Relief Committee.
Aha. Why do all
American women pursue me?
Wh...
Of course, I do not blame you.
Your men here, they are so weak.
They are nothing.
I... I don't think you understand, Monsieur.
It's just that I wanted you to gather toge...
Ah, yes, I understand.
These men here, they...
Uh, they bore you.
But this week, I have no time for you at all.
My time is, uh, occupied.
But next week...
Oh, excuse me, please.
Papa Gregory?
Hmm?
He's gone crazy.
Who's gone crazy?
Boris Stronskoff.
I talked to him just now, and he didn't make a word of sense.
You talked to him?
Yes.
Ha ha! Allow me.
Miss Carter, this is Boris Stronskoff.
Madame.
How do you do?
Then who is that man? Look.
Ho ho ho! Is that the man you talked to?
Yes. I asked him to sing for me.
Sing? That's
William Gordon.
He was head of the A.P. bureau in the far east.
Just come home to join the Army.
He belongs in front of a drugstore in the middle west.
Oh, no. He's not as bad as that.
Still, he did make a rather strange remark to me a moment ago.
Me, too.
Oh, Joel, will you help us at the doll booth?
Why, of course.
What can I do?
Come along, darling, and I'll show you.
Good-bye, papa Gregory. I'm off to make your fortune.
I've got the very person. Splendid.
Attention, everyone.
This is something very special.
I'm going to sell this doll to the highest bidder.
Whoever buys it will be kissed by Miss Joel Carter.
Oh, no! I couldn't!
Yes, you are.
What am I bid?
Oh, no, really,
Mrs. Hendricks.
My dear, it's for charity.
Come along, now. What am I bid?
A kiss from Miss Joel Carter.
One dollar!
Two dollars!
Who'll pay 6? $6.00?
Why, I wouldn't jeopardize her amateur standing for that sum.
Do I hear 11?
Do I hear 11?
Going... going...
That's better.
Do I hear 12?
Remember, gentlemen, you don't get a chance every day to kiss Miss Joel Carter.
$15. Thanks. There's a gentleman who knows a bargain.
Now I'm bid $16.
Why, you pay that much for an orchid, and you're bidding on a kiss from a charming young lady.
Who's going to make it 30? 30?
$30. Do I hear 31?
Do I hear $31?
Do I hear $30.50?
Do I hear $30.25?
Come, come, gentlemen.
Going at $30.
Going... going...
Gone to the gentleman on my right for $30.
I suppose you thought that was funny.
I have changed my mind.
I will sing for you.
Miss Joel Carter, I believe.
Captain Nieterstein.
I was wondering if you were even going to speak to me.
Oh, Nikki, you're angry with me.
I leave it to you as a fair-minded woman.
Two broken luncheon engagements.
Nikki, Nikki, I am sorry.
I'll tell you what I'll do.
The first free moment I have,
I'll phone you, and we'll make a date.
And I'll be there on time.
May I consider this a promise?
You may.
I shall live near the telephone.
Oh, thank you.
And now, if you'll excuse me,
I have something important to attend to for his excellency.
Of course.
Long distance, please.
Dr. R.A. Jackson in San Diego.
Reverse the charges.
Yes, that's right.
Reverse the charges.
Dr. Jackson will pay for the call.
Long distance.
Washington, D.C., calling Dr.
Jackson at San Diego 2163 w.
Chicago. One moment.
Los Angeles. Hold the wire, please.
Washington, D.C., calling San Diego 2163w.
Dr. Jackson?
Yes, this is
Dr. Jackson.
How are you, my dear friend?
How's the stock market?
The market is quite dependable,
I think, especially in munitions stocks.
My agent, therefore, advised me to sell your Western Chemicals
1,900 shares at 40 and to buy North American,
4,800 shares at 21.
I recommend you let this deal go through.
And do not change, as your profits later on will be much greater.
Thanks a lot. I know you'll make some real money for me.
When will you phone the next market news?
Tomorrow at 3:00.
That's noon your time.
Very good, my friend.
Good-bye, and thank you.
S.S. Dependable.
Munitions.
Longitude
19-40 west, latitude
48-21 north.
Tomorrow at noon.
But he says to let it go through... let it go through because profit later on will be much greater.
Let it go through?
A ship full of ammunition to be used against our troops?
Bring me the medicine.
Nieterstein is my superior, sir, but I think he's insane, if
I may be permitted to say.
But you're not permitted to say.
And Nieterstein is your superior because he has the insanity you charge him with.
Can't you see it's a trap?
We let this ship through, they think they're safe, and when the first troopship is at sea, what a Roman Holiday for the fish.
Buenos dias, senor.
Emergency case.
Pase usted, doctor.
Gracias, senor.
How's your husband?
He is resting, doctor.
I won't disturb him.
I'll be back later.
Here. Give him this medicine.
Gracias, doctor.
Gracias.
Vamanos.
Achtung!
Thanks to you, Major
Brennan, and your code, our test ship got through.
I was sure it would, sir.
We'll use the same protective measures to get our troopships through.
A million of our men must be in the field within 6 months.
Isn't it awful when they grow up and you have to tell them about the birds and the flowers and the bees?
Ha ha! Any, uh, grandchildren?
You ain't got no permit to parade.
Clear the street.
Come on!
Give me my sign!
Give me that banner!
Let me alone!
Don't hurt me!
Hey, buddy, wait a minute.
Now, wait a minute.
Listen. I'm in...
You're resisting an Officer, now.
Officer?
What?
Ohh!
Why... well, the man's a marvel.
Well, what do you know about that?
How am I doing?
Well, look.
That's a-fine.
Nobody she's a-know your husband, he wallop you now.
Well, this is as far as you go.
Ah, come on.
Change your mind.
I know a place where they've got the most awe... inspiring Hamburgers...
Oh, no.
Really, I can't.
This is the third time
I've broken this date.
Now I've really got to go through with it.
See? See, there it is in that uniform.
Where? Let me have a look at it.
That's a cinch.
I can fix that.
Oh, no, you don't.
But all I've got to do is explain to him...
No. I am lunching with him.
I bet you have to pay the check.
Now, these Hamburgers are the most amazing, beautiful, big...
Sorry. Good-bye.
You won't change your mind?
Uh-uh.
Well, thanks for the black eye.
Same to you.
I never got a shiner in nicer company.
The pleasure was mutual.
I bet I never get a chance to sock another eye like yours.
There isn't one left in the world.
Do you really think so?
Now, today we have with us
Miss Barbie Burns of Broadway, who will personally kiss every lucky fella that enlists.
Now, that's pretty high pay for just doing your duty, ain't it?
Come on up, fellas.
Come on, now, everyone.
I've been cheated.
I enlisted, and nobody kissed me.
You'd better hurry.
There's a good chance.
You don't think I was hinting at anything, do you?
Oh, no, no.
Never gave it a thought.
You think you might at the train?
Might what?
Give the matter a little thought?
Well, uh, what time does your train go?
Oh, uh... in about, uh, half an hour.
Really? So soon?
Mm-hmm.
Oh. Well, I don't mind going as far as the station with you.
Good.
I don't think Captain
Nieterstein will mind.
No, of course he won't.
He's not a bad chap.
I don't know why I treat him this way.
All aboard!
You'll take care of yourself, won't you?
Oh, sure.
You do the same.
Mm-hmm.
Oh, your train is going!
Oh, your train is gone!
Well, a train is gone.
What?
My train doesn't leave until tomorrow morning.
Why, you told me this was your last day.
Why, you've taken advantage of me.
Yes.
Well!
I must say you do things well, Lieutenant... luncheon, tea, dinner...
Now, what more could a girl ask?
I'm what's known as a good provider.
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
Well, this is where I live.
I'm home now.
Already?
Now, we've been walking for hours.
I'll tell you what.
Let's walk just once around the world. What do you say?
We'll end up here just the same.
I'm afraid you might miss your train.
I wish that train didn't leave till the day after tomorrow.
Why don't... why couldn't you get a desk job here in Washington?
Lots of people are doing it.
Oh, not for me. That's just the trouble.
Trouble?
You see, years ago out in the far east, when news was scarce,
I entertained myself writing a book.
Really?
Oh, not the kind of a book you think.
This was a book on codes.
It was called how to encipher and how to decipher how do you like that for a title?
Ha ha! A love story, eh?
Ha ha ha!
Well, I didn't want to let the boss know that I was wasting my time on codes so I had the book published under a nom de plume...
Anson Meridan.
That's me.
Ha ha ha! Well?
Well, the Government... the War Department's been raising heaven and earth trying to find me, that's all.
Oh. You mean if they did find you, they'd keep you in Washington, eh?
They would, but they won't, because I'm going to do my fighting at the front, not behind a desk.
Oh, I don't blame you at all.
I quite agree with you.
You do?
Uh-huh.
Ha ha ha!
You know, uh, I've changed my mind again.
I wish that train didn't leave for two days.
Two days... like this one?
Exactly like this, only...
Only what?
I wonder if there really is a war going on over there?
Oh, Bill, don't go.
My darling...
How do you suppose I ever happened to call you that?
Do call me that, please.
Say it again.
Darling.
Mmm.
How's that?
Oh. Oh, Bill.
Lieutenant Gordon?
Yes?
Major Sloan's compliments, sir.
The Major instructs the Lieutenant that he's been transferred to the War Department and to report for duty at 10:00.
What are you talking about?
They can't do this to me.
I'm not going to sit behind a desk with a war going on!
I'm going to France!
Sorry, sir.
The Major's orders.
Well, what the...
Say, what kind of a war is this?
Anything wrong, Lieutenant?
Wrong?
Less than an hour ago, I, a free and patriotic citizen of the United States, am on my way to France, when all of a sudden
I'm yanked from the train, threatened with arrest, and summoned here for what?
To face an endless line of doors marked "keep out."
What's this country coming to, anyway?
Will you join me in protest against the inefficient, incompetent bureaucratic administration of our so-called War Department?
Why, I'd be delighted,
Lieutenant, uh...
Gordon.
Lieutenant Gordon.
Late of the 73rd, now a man without a country.
Suppose we make our protest now?
Attaboy!
Hey, together, you and I will start a movement that...
Won't you come in, Lieutenant?
I'm Assistant Secretary of War.
That's all right, Lieutenant.
We always like constructive criticism.
At least, I do.
Will you have a cigar?
You mind if I smoke?
Now for the protest movement. Where do we start?
Well...
Mr. secretary,
I ask you...
I'm on my way to France.
I break a beautiful girl's heart to say good-bye.
Bands playing, flags waving, bayonets gleaming in the sun, and what happens?
I'm dragged here and loaded down with pens, pencils, erasers, eyeshades, paper clips.
Does that make sense?
Can't figure it out, eh?
No, sir. It certainly is a puzzle to me.
Well, let's take a hypothetical case.
Suppose you were in charge of this office and you'd been hunting high and low for months for a code expert, a fellow with the nom de plume of Anson Meredith, a fellow you thought you really needed.
Am I boring you?
Then suppose you found out that he'd been commissioned under his real name in the Army, some other branch that didn't need him nearly as much as you did, and that he was leaving for an embarcation point this morning.
What would you do?
Exactly.
Take Lieutenant Gordon to Major Brennan.
Would I be court-martialed, sir, if I asked who got me into this?
You have your orders, Lieutenant.
Yes, sir.
Shall I... shall I announce you now, Miss Carter?
Carter...
Carter.
So you got me into this, huh?
Now, please.
Don't get excited.
You can do just as much good over here as you can over there.
And I thought it would be...
You thought! Who asked you to think?
What business is this of yours?
What's all this noise?
Honor and traditions of a man's family... nothing is sacred to her.
What will my children think of a father who fought from behind a desk?
Children?
Children?
It's purely hypothetical, Uncle Stevie.
My dear niece to the
Assistant Secretary of War...
Lieutenant Gordon, will you report to Major Brennan or must I arrange a military escort?
I'll go, sir.
Maybe this'll teach me a lesson not to let myself get picked up by strange women.
Thank you.
I was ordered to report to Major Brennan, sir.
Oh, yes.
Come in. Come in.
I'm Lieutenant
William Gordon, sir.
Oh, yes, Lieutenant Gordon.
Delighted to know you.
I've admired your book for years.
Thank you.
Let me see, it was called...
Oh, Roberts...
What was the name of that Gordon book?
How to encipher and how to decipher, sir.
Thank you, Roberts.
I never can remember names and titles.
Roberts has been remembering them for me for the last 10 years.
You did write that book, didn't you?
Yes, sir.
It sold 5 copies.
I bought 3 of them.
Well, you're very modest, Lieutenant.
The book is very well known among students of cryptography.
Do you know what this is?
Wireless intercept.
Well, I suppose it's an enemy wireless message that your operators picked out of the air.
Exactly.
We know they are coming from some powerful sending station below the border.
And we suspect they contain information gathered in this country by enemy espionage agents.
Now, the Mexican Government tried to locate the station for us but so far, with no success.
We can't read these.
Do you think you could?
I think so.
But will you?
- No, sir.
- Hmm?
Because it's an "I lose if I win proposition."
Ha ha! I don't understand you.
If I decipher them, I'll get what I don't want:
A permanent berth behind a desk.
But this is the Army, man.
You've got to do as you're told.
I was brought here against my will, sir.
But I can't be made to think against my will.
Yes, I know exactly how you feel.
Thank you.
Look, here.
If you succeed in making anything of these,
I might be able to arrange for you to have a wack at the enemy at a little closer range.
Is that a promise, sir?
That's all, Lieutenant.
Report to Mr. Gardner in the decoding room.
Yes, sir. p-n... p-n... o-q-r-r... o-q-r-r... f-t-n-o. f-t-n-o.
Yes? Yes, this is Gardner.
Well, try the secondhand bookstores.
We've got to have copies of all their shorthand systems!
I don't care!
Pay anything!
Say, I beg your pardon but...
Don't interrupt. I told you never to interrupt. r- n-p... r-n-p...
New intercept, sir. o-t-o-t-l... o-t-o-t-l...
Don't touch anything on the tables!
Oh, you're the new man.
There's a desk over there.
Just sit down. I'll be with you in a minute. l-f-r-o-n-o-z... l-f-r-o-n-o-z...
Good evening, Lieutenant.
Good evening.
I hope you like your desk, Lieutenant.
Tabulate them into letter groups
- two letters.
Now, this is a frequency chart.
Sounds very complicated, but it really isn't.
Enables us to find how often each letter appears in a message.
This is a regular printed alphabet.
Now, what I want you to do is to put a check next to each letter every time it appears in these intercepts.
It's the first step in breaking the cipher... exactly what those men are doing.
Take your time. And be sure you're accurate.
Accuracy is the first essential in cipher reading.
It didn't work, sir.
Well, it may work by a mathematical formula.
Tabulate the number of letters between all repetitions.
Either we'll find a common factor or we'll go crazy.
Personally, I think we'll go crazy. Oh!
Does everybody around here get like that?
We do during these times.
When the enemy has something on the fire, they fill the air with phony messages to cover up the real ones.
So, then we know that something hot is happening, but we don't know what.
So, the Army heckles the
Intelligence Department.
The Intelligence
Department heckles us.
We haven't got anybody to heckle.
So, we heckle ourselves.
You mind telling me how long you've been heckling yourself here.
6 months.
6 months!
It takes 3 months to get on to the fundamentals.
I cut my eyeteeth on fundamentals.
That intercept came from below the border.
We can presume it's either in
German, Spanish, or English.
It obviously isn't English because "e" is the most frequent letter in English and you've got no "e"s there.
It can't be German because you've got a flock of "q"s there and there are no "q"s in German.
It can't be Spanish because in Spanish
"q" is always followed by "u" and you've got no us there.
What did you say your name was?
Gordon.
Major Brennan sent me.
Why didn't you say so?
Glad to have you.
We can use you.
I hope you've got a good constitution.
Why?
You'll need it.
Have a chair.
Sit down, Lieutenant Gordon. Sit down.
No, thank you. I've got a date in France.
I'm in a hurry to keep it.
Can I borrow that?
Gardner, haven't you had enough?
Go home and get some sleep.
Let Lieutenant Gordon have a crack at it.
Thank you, sir!
You might report to me in the morning.
Well, I'll only be here for a little while, sir.
I'd certainly like to get away.
Could you tell me where I can reach you?
I'm afraid not.
Well, is there any chance that
I can make that first boat, sir?
I'm almost certain you couldn't.
Good night, Lieutenant.
Good night.
Major Brennan.
Mr. Grayson will escort you to the bridge.
Yes, sir.
Here's the code book, Captain.
Thank you, sir.
We've done everything in our power to ensure its secrecy.
I understand, sir.
The rendezvous position will be radioed to you at sea.
God speed you, Captain.
We've been on the wrong track all night.
It also proves that I'm not going anywhere for a while.
New intercept, sir.
The Intelligence
Department reports that it may be important.
It's been sent 8 times the last two hours.
Dean.
Yes, sir.
Erase that stuff on the board, will you?
And put this in it's place.
Yes, sir.
We might as well take a crack at it.
Morning, boys.
Morning, Miss Carter.
Sorry, Miss Carter.
Oh, I fooled you, boys.
This time I have one.
Oh, good morning!
Have you been working all night?
Oh, no. No, we just caroused.
Got a case of scotch, a 3-piece orchestra, and made a night of it.
Now, Bill, Bill, do you want to kill yourself, starting off at a pace like this?
Ideally, you should have someone to relieve you.
Miss Carter, your concern touches me deeply.
I'm moved almost to tears.
Well, I can go to my Uncle...
Your Uncle, my eye.
I'll get myself out of this mess.
You can put on your running pants and take a nice marathon out into the country... about 30 Miles out, where the cows are.
Oh, but, Bill, promise me you'll lie down for just a little while at least...
I promise you that if you don't get out of here,
I'll lie down on the floor and scream.
I'll go.
I'll go.
Have you something... some kind of sedative to put a nervous person to sleep?
Yes, Miss.
How many at a time?
Oh, one will put you to sleep in a hurry.
Oh, it's not for me.
Say, that'll put a mule to sleep.
That's just what it's for.
Will you please give this to Lieutenant Gordon?
He sent out for it.
Yes, ma'am.
And the trick is...
To find the combination...
Oh, coffee, thanks.
Just what I need.
Now, we can disregard the "hsi" because that's merely the wireless call signal.
Yes, sir.
Now, let's assume for a start that each letter there means the letter after it in the alphabet.
Yes, sir. k- l, d-e, w-x, n-o, y-z...
Oh, that doesn't seem to be getting us anywhere, Dean.
Try it in the reverse order... the letter before it in the alphabet.
Yes, sir.
Say, I'll be back in just a minute.
Good morning.
Good morning, Lieutenant.
You haven't something in here that'll keep a fellow awake, have you?
I've tried coffee, and it doesn't seem to be working.
I think so.
You're the new man, aren't you?
Uh-huh.
Ha ha! Well, I'm
Professor Martin.
Here. Try some of this "no sleep."
Pour some of it right in the palm of your hand.
How much?
Oh, a generous teaspoon full.
Well, I'd better take an extra big shot.
Put it right in this water and drink it right down.
I used to give that to my pupils when they wanted to stay awake while they crammed for their final examinations.
Ha! Afraid they stayed awake, all right, but they did very little cramming.
Well, thanks.
You're welcome.
That was just what I needed, that.
You know what?
It didn't work.
I tried the first letter forward and also one back.
And that didn't work.
What's the matter, Lieutenant?
I don't know. My head's spinning, and my heart's jumping.
Get a doctor.
And tell him to bring a stomach pump. Quick!
Doctor?
Stomach pump?
I guess I put too many sleeping tablets in your coffee.
You put sleeping tablets in my coffee?
I only wanted you to get a little rest.
Oh, this woman is mad.
Guard! Guard!
Oh, guard.
You aren't going to be angry with me, are you, Bill?
Show this lady the door
- the front door.
And if she tries to get in again, use your gun.
Oh, but, Bill,
I just wanted...
Don't shoot to kill.
Just wing her.
I don't want her haunting me.
Right in there, Lieutenant.
Well, suppose you try two letters forward and two back.
You take 3 forward and 3 back.
You 4, and you 5.
And will you take 6...
6 forward and 6 back?
You 7, 8, 9, consecutively on down the line.
Backward, forward.
Lieutenant Gordon.
Yes.
This looks like something.
5 forward and 5 back. f-i-r-s... first.
Well, that certainly does look like something.
First. First what?
First troop ship?
What's the next group? g-d-o-u-g.
First "gdoug".
That certainly doesn't sound like troop ship, does it?
No, sir.
Say, wait a minute!
What day of the month is this?
First.
Hey, you don't suppose...
That in the letters of this first group they're using the date when the message was sent as a key word for the rest of the message, do you?
Let's try it out on the cipher wheels.
Let "a" equal "f" on your wheel.
Let "a" equal "I" on yours.
Let "a" equal "r" on yours.
Equal "s" on yours...
And equal "t" on yours.
All right. What's the first letter of the message?
B.
B.
"B" becomes "w."
I.
Becomes "a."
J.
Becomes "s."
Z.
Becomes "h."
V.
Becomes "I." w-a-s-h-i...
Hey, if the next letter is only an "n..."
And it is. g-t o-n
Washington!
Washington.
Now we're getting somewhere.
Let's have the rest of it. s-a-i... right off the straight line. s-t-a-t-o-s we got it!
"Washington sailed stand by for rendezvous position."
"Washington sailed.
Stand by for rendezvous position."
That's the message we sent to the British Admiralty, Major.
Exactly.
We intercept a wireless in enemy code.
Thanks to Lieutenant Gordon, we're able to decode it.
And we find they're sending out the same message that we sent to inform their U-Boat Commanders of the coming of the transport.
But how could they know anything about it?
You don't think they could have broken your cipher?
Impossible.
It's a code not a cipher.
Only one message has been encoded in it.
Without a copy it's unbreakable.
Then someone must have stolen it.
No, no, no.
Every copy in Washington is under my personal control.
We've no choice.
We must recall the ship.
We can't recall the ship.
It'll damage the allied morale to the breaking point.
There's no way to get a new code to them.
The rendezvous position must be sent in the code we gave the ship's Captain, which has been stolen by the enemy.
We're in a nice mess.
If we send it, the enemy knows the transport's position.
If we don't and let the ship take it's chances, it'll probably sink it anyway.
We still have 3 days, sir.
And what will we do with them?
Find whoever stole the code.
Get it back or prevent them from intercepting and sending our messages.
All that in 3 days?
I shall see to it that you have the cooperation of every department that can be of the slightest use.
We'll need it.
Thank you, gentlemen.
Wait here and keep your eye on this for me.
Yes, sir.
Miss Cullough's apartment please.
Hello, Olivia?
My dear, could you come over?
Could you?
Right away?
Thank you.
What's the matter, Charles?
Something has happened...
Something very unfortunate.
About us?
You don't mean there's been some gossip?
No, darling, no.
There's nothing for you to worry about.
But if you worry, I worry.
What is it, Charles?
I can't understand it.
I know I had it when
I left the department.
I thought I brought it up here.
Is it something you've lost?
Is it important?
Vitally.
A dispatch.
I had it in my briefcase along with some other papers.
One can hardly mislay a briefcase.
If it should fall into the wrong hands...
Oh, but it mustn't.
Of course it won't.
Let's try and think.
How long ago did you leave the department?
About an hour.
And then what did you do?
Well, I walked to the club, had a cup of coffee, and then took a Taxi.
You sure you didn't leave it at the club?
I telephoned immediately.
They hadn't found it.
But they're making a thorough search.
What about the Taxi?
I don't even know the name of the company.
Oh, that's easy. We'll notify them all.
Are you sure you didn't stop off anywhere else?
Hello? Get me the ACME
Taxi Company. Thank you.
Yes.
The tobacconist.
By Joe, I forgot that.
I'll go back there.
Darling, you're so tired and overworked, you can't even think straight.
Hello? Give me the Lost
And Found Department, please.
Thank you. I will.
Listen, darling, we'll find it. Don't worry.
Now, you go to the club, and if it isn't there, go on to the department.
Phone me when you get there.
I'm beginning to feel better already.
Hurry, darling.
Hello? Lost And Found Department?
Yes. I'm reporting the loss of a briefcase left in a Taxi.
Mm-hmm. Thank you.
Drive around the corner.
Yes, sir.
Would you like to earn $10?
Would I!?
I want you to drive back to the Andover Arms and take this briefcase to Apartment 4 c.
4 c?
Yes.
Ok. That's a soft way to pick up 10 bucks.
Wait a minute.
You're to tell the lady you hand it to the gentleman left it in your Taxi about a half an hour ago and that you saw the address on the tag.
I get you.
Party by the name of Brennan live here?
Oh, yes.
A gentleman left this in my Taxi.
Oh, thanks. Wait a moment please.
It's a lucky thing I saw the name on the tag.
We've been looking all over for it.
Thank you.
Thank you, Miss.
Did you give it to the lady?
Yes, sir.
All right.
Now forget the whole incident.
Yes, sir.
Charles!
Where are they?
810. They're waiting for you.
Anything wrong?
Yes.
Oh, how do you do, my dear? Come right in.
How are you?
I didn't know anyone had relieved you from duty.
Anything wrong?
Everything.
I killed Brennan.
What?
But why?
I couldn't help it.
I had to, I tell you.
After all, what's one life in a war?
I don't regret one life, only your stupidity.
I had one of his dispatches.
He caught me.
It was his life or mine.
There was no choice.
There was a choice.
But you didn't have the courage to make it.
With Brennan killed, they can suspect only one thing:
That we have the code.
The vital thing is to find out what they do suspect.
But our only contact's gone.
We must form a new one.
Immediately.
It's your one chance to redeem your blunder.
What are your orders?
In war, one must always credit the enemy with as much Intelligence as oneself.
They will be searching for you soon enough.
The wisest plan is to let them find you.
Parade, rest!
Major Charles Brennan died as he fought, bravely and alone, far from his country and his home.
We owe him a debt which cannot ever be repaid.
We fervently pray that
God may rest his soul in peace.
Any idea who that woman is, sir?
I haven't the slightest idea.
Mrs. Brennan is in
England, isn't she?
Yes.
If that woman is a relative, it's strange that she hasn't shown before now.
If she's in deep mourning.
It is strange, isn't it?
Roberts, I'd like you to give me a bit of information about Major Brennan.
It's all right.
Lieutenant Gordon's been placed in charge.
You were with the Major a long while, weren't you?
Yes, sir.
Do you know whether he had any very close women friends?
I wouldn't know, sir. Sorry.
I see.
All right, Roberts.
Yes, sir.
Rudy.
Yes, sir.
That woman in black.
How long has she been here?
Just a few moments, sir.
We've been wondering who she is.
So have we.
Unless I miss my guess, she's been planted here.
Planted?
For what reason?
Obviously to be picked up.
Suppose you tag her, find out who she is, then pick her up.
Yes, sir.
We just picked this up from the post office.
It's marked New York.
Miss Olivia Karloff, Andover
Arms Hotel, Washington, D.C.
Well?
The woman in black.
Last night.
Oh, yes.
Just an advertisement, apparently.
Apparently.
But do you notice the stamp?
Just an ordinary two cent stamp.
Exactly. Two cents.
Now, if it's just an advertisement, it could have gone for one cent... unsealed.
Why should they use a two cent stamp?
Well, let's have a look at it in the reflectoscope.
That's just what I was thinking.
Do you mind turning that light out, Lieutenant?
Thanks.
How's it look to you?
From outward appearances, it's a bona fide advertisement.
You see, even the grain, if it has been disturbed, has been cleverly ironed back into place.
If there's a hidden message, we'll have to find the reagent to bring it out.
That's quite a job with so many reagents.
Every secret ink has its own developer.
Calls for a lot of experimentation.
You know, trial and error method.
Not a very definite method.
Why, I can give it the fiber test right now.
Won't take a minute.
Let's do it.
Your hunch was right,
Lieutenant.
This circular undoubtedly contains a hidden message.
Then if we can get some hint as to the type of reagent...
Where do spies generally carry reagent?
Well, 9 times out of 10, the reagent is impregnated in the clothing worn by the person to whom the message is sent.
In case it's a woman, it may be her stockings or perhaps her underwear, or in cloth-covered buttons, or...
I've got another hunch.
Yes?
I think within an hour,
I can provide the reagent we're after.
Meantime, go on with your experimenting, Professor.
Just what are you doing?
Oh! Good morning, Bill.
How did you get in here?
Well, I had a pass for the chamber, all right.
When your orderly went to the filing cabinet, why, I just opened the door and walked right in.
I'll bet they never even missed me.
I bet I shan't either.
Suppose you open the door and walk right out again?
But, Bill, I only came because
I was so worried about you.
The last time you worried about me, you nearly killed me with sleeping powders.
Now it's a bayonet.
Oh, Bill, don't be silly.
It was the only thing
I could find in here to cut the string on my parcel.
Oh. The department gave me this office to fight a war, not for you to use as a parcel room. Come on.
Oh, but, Bill, look what
I have for you in here.
Out you go. But, please. Wait a minute.
Come on.
But, Bill, really.
It's for you.
I got up early this morning and got it just for your protection.
And the man I bought if from said you couldn't even feel it when you had it on.
Why, you can wash it, and it won't rust.
It's thin, and will stand all kinds of abuse.
I'll bite. What is it?
What is it?
A bulletproof vest.
No one else would have thought of that.
No one, dear.
No one at liberty.
Sleeping tablets, bayonets, bulletproof vests,
Huh! What a gal.
Come on.
Uh-uh. No, you don't.
I won't go until you tell me when I can see you.
Hmm. How about dinner tonight, Bill?
I've got to eat.
I suppose it might as well be with you.
Oh, lovely.
Bill, what would you like me to wear tonight?
How about a strait-jacket?
Hee hee hee.
Oh, how do you do?
Well, good-bye.
Good-bye.
Won't you come in, please?
I'll join you in just a moment.
Bye.
Olivia Karloff.
Russian.
She came back to
Washington by cab.
Went to the Andover
Arms Apartments where Brennan was killed.
Thank you.
Won't you sit down, please?
No, thanks.
But I would like some explanation of this insanity.
Now, Miss Karloff, you were brought here to answer questions, not to ask them.
Uh, do you mind removing your veil?
Not at all.
Thank you.
And now I'll have to ask you to take off the rest of your clothes.
Oh, I beg your pardon. Heh.
That was rather abrupt, wasn't it?
Yes, rather.
Uh, will you send me a matron, please?
Would it be asking too much for you to tell me why you're so interested in my clothes?
Oh, not at all.
We want them for chemical investigation.
It's a rule, you understand.
Mm-hmm. Yes.
I suppose I shall have to understand.
You sent for a matron, sir.
Yes.
Will you please take Miss
Karloff behind that screen and get her clothes?
Yes, sir.
This way, please.
Nothing in the hat, Lieutenant.
Here you are, sir.
Do you wish to examine these?
Is that all, matron?
That's all.
She's bowlegged.
Would you please give
Miss Karloff that coat?
Then go to the nearest department store and get her a new outfit to replace these.
Size 14.
She'll never get into a 14.
Go get it, please.
Here's a little work for the boys.
I think I'll have the married ones work on these.
I see.
Then why were you at Major
Brennan's funeral last night?
Funeral?
My men followed you from the dock.
I went to the boat to see a friend off.
Certainly you went to see a friend off.
And that friend was Brennan.
Why don't you stop lying?
Our records show that you came to this country with him, you stayed at the same hotel, you dined together, he made you expensive presents, and last night, you were at his funeral.
What were you to him?
I loved him.
Let's have the rest of it.
I went to his apartment around 4:00 that day.
He wasn't there.
So I thought I'd fix some tea and have it for him when he returned.
I went into the kitchen, he was on the floor.
I was about to telephone the police, but I was afraid of exposure.
Why did you fear exposure?
Because I'd have to tell the police the same as I'm telling you.
You see, his wife never knew about us.
To her, Brennan will have died in the service for his country.
That was very generous of you.
Generous. Do you think
I care about her?
I did it for him...
Because I knew he'd want it that way.
Cigarette?
You see, I'm rather lonely here.
Most of my friends are in England.
You're not going to keep me here, are you?
If your passport is in order, there should be nothing to prevent your leaving.
Hope I haven't forgotten anything.
I'll get you a release from the Secretary of War.
Thanks. This is my first experience with American Officers.
How did you make out?
It was very pleasant.
Lieutenant Gordon is charming.
Don't you think so?
Well, of course I've always met him with my clothes on.
Oh, Lieutenant, I... he's not here.
Well, do you know where he is?
Yes, he went to see the Secretary of War.
Well, when he returns, would you kindly have him see me immediately about this beauty circular?
Certainly.
Thank you.
Fine.
I don't understand, Lieutenant, why you want to let her know we have the circular.
The idea is to force her hand today.
Unless the German Ring is rounded up in the next 48 hours, we can't send the rendezvous position to that troop ship.
Now, if that beauty circular contains damaging information... oh, I get you.
She'll contact headquarters to warn the others.
Exactly.
When that woman leaves my office, don't lose her for a second.
Tell Clark to put two men on her telephone immediately.
Ok.
Oh, uh, Miss Karloff,
I do hope you like the outfit.
I did try to get something becoming.
That will be all, matron.
It's very difficult shopping for someone else, you know.
Yes.
And such a bargain, too.
Only $4.98 for the whole outfit.
I'm afraid this has been rather trying for you.
But not uninteresting, Lieutenant.
Suppose I telephone you tomorrow.
Yes. I think I shall feel better in the morning.
About 10:00?
At 10:00.
Good.
Oh, matron, when I go shopping for my fall outfit, may I call on you?
Made a monkey out of you, didn't she?
Are you sure she didn't make one out of you?
Heh heh.
Brought this man from the coding room to translate this for you. It's in Russian.
Followed her every minute from the time she left here.
She went first to the Orthodox Church.
Inside the door, she bought a candle.
Then she wrote on that slip of paper and left it for the priest there.
Can you translate it?
Oh, yes. It's from the Church, huh?
In memory of the servant of God, William Brennan, please offer up a prayer.
Well, that's the final test.
It's negative.
Just a prayer slip, after all.
Well, there's something queer about this Church business.
You're sure that she didn't speak to anybody after she bought the candle?
We're positive, Lieutenant.
She went over to the altar and knelt down to pray.
Well, we'll keep on shadowing her, though I don't think it's going to get us anywhere.
She's a very clever woman.
You say she went straight home from the Church, huh?
Yes, Lieutenant.
Look up the number to the
Andover Arms for me. Will you?
Right.
Got an idea?
Well, Church or no Church, she must be pretty worried about that circular.
If I can catch her right now while she is worried,
I may be able to find out what she knows.
Capital 7296.
Thanks.
Capital 72...
Uh, never mind, operator.
Now what?
It just struck me.
If she really is worried, she'll try to find out what I know, won't she?
Yes, I guess she will.
Let's wait and see if she doesn't phone me.
How's that for deduction?
All right, if it works.
Meantime, keep right after that circular, Professor.
There's something there somewhere.
I'll wear out the paper trying.
That's the idea.
Hello.
You'll find cigars in the lower drawer.
Well?
Well, what?
Well, how do I look?
You're surely not going to wear that outfit.
Well, certainly.
Why, Bill, I wore it just to please you.
It's going to look swell in the cafeteria.
Cafeteria?!
Oh, I ordered a table for us at the Cordon Rouge.
I'm sorry, but 30 minutes is as long as this desk can spare me for dinner this evening.
Oh. If I had any pride,
I'd go right home.
Instead of that, here I am chasing you.
Do you know any other girls who would?
Thousands.
Then why don't you get yourself one?
How can I with you snooping around all the time?
How would you like to have your eyes scratched out?
Hello?
Oh, Miss Karloff.
Fine. I'm glad you called.
Suppose we have dinner together this evening?
Cordon Rouge? Fine, fine.
Heh heh. Good-bye.
I thought you were having dinner with me.
Now, Joel, you know I wouldn't do this if it weren't very important.
All I know is that you've broken your promise to me.
Why must I always keep reminding you that there's a war going on?
Of course, I wasn't good enough to take the Cordon Rouge.
You were too busy.
A cafeteria was all you could offer me.
But the minute that... that Venus of the Russian steppes calls, you have the time and the inclination.
But, my dear...
All right.
All right. Go ahead.
I don't have to throw myself away on you.
I'm still young.
I'm beautiful.
I'll go where I'm appreciated.
Well, I'm sorry, but you must understand
I cannot neglect any possibilities.
Of course not. I never met the man yet that could.
We'll order dessert later.
Yes, sir.
I suppose, Lieutenant, you've been wondering why I asked you to take me to dinner.
I rather cherished the hope that it was because you, uh, wanted to have dinner with me.
I wanted to talk to you, Lieutenant, about a very serious matter.
Yes?
This afternoon in your office, one of your men brought in a beauty circular.
I couldn't help seeing it.
Well?
Would you tell me where you found that circular?
At the post office...
Addressed to you.
Oh!
Thank you.
I feel better now.
Lieutenant, the day that
Major Brennan was killed...
Oh, hello!
Surprised to see me?
No.
Aren't you dancing, too?
No.
Chatty fellow, isn't he?
Oh, I forgot you two don't know each other.
May I present Lieutenant Gordon,
Captain Nieterstein.
How do you do?
How do you do?
Allow me. Miss Karloff, Miss Carter.
The matron, you'll remember.
This is her night off.
Oh, uh, Captain Nieterstein.
Oh, hello, Uncle John.
Oh, hello, Joel...
Gordon, Captain.
Miss Karloff,
Mr. Carter.
How do you do? So this is where you fight the war, eh?
Colonel Petroff and I just came from a late ordnance conference.
Captain Nieterstein.
His excellence has just called you, sir.
Would you be good enough to return immediately?
Thank you.
What?
I'm terribly sorry.
I'm afraid I have no choice.
May I take you home?
You certainly may not.
I just left home.
Well, I shall be back as soon as I can.
Well, don't hurry on my account.
I'm among friends.
Well, forgive me and au revoir.
Ah, this war is getting to be a nuisance, isn't it?
Oh, Uncle John, why don't you ask Colonel what's-his-name to come over here and we all 5 could be together.
He wouldn't mind, would he?
Uh, well, we better go back to my table.
You'll excuse us, won't you? Oh!
Always glad to excuse anyone who wants to go back to his own table.
You're not fooling anyone.
That meant me.
I'm sorry for these interruptions.
Now, what about Major Brennan?
The day that
Major Brennan was killed, he received a beauty circular exactly like the one
I saw in your office.
He did?
Yes, I remember laughing about it at the time... a man receiving a beauty circular.
We didn't think it was important then.
What makes you think that it's important now?
Because you attach so much importance to it.
Oh, I know you must.
And it was addressed to me.
Well, Miss Karloff, we intercepted that circular just as we would have intercepted any message coming to you.
You were under suspicion because of your acknowledged affiliation with a man who was killed.
Oh, I see.
Of course, I know very little about these things.
But isn't there some way that you can trace a letter like that, find out who sent it?
And then, if there is any danger...
I assure you, we'll do everything we can.
And I'm very grateful to you for telling me about it.
It may lead to something.
Call for you, Lieutenant.
I might as well have had dinner in my office.
Pardon me.
Hello?
Hello!
Gordon! This is Martin!
Yes?
Gordon I've got it!
The beauty circular... it's...
Oh, the paper. Yeah, you'll find that on Martin's desk.
Yes. I left it there this afternoon.
If you gentlemen think I'm going to leave my dinner for any such nonsense, you're sadly mistaken.
Well, if you can't find it, why don't you call on the boy scouts they're usually very effective.
Hello? Hello?
Who is this?
The paper must be there.
I left it there just as sure as my name's Bill Gordon.
Oh, Lieutenant Gordon.
Well, a terrible thing has happened.
They've just killed
Professor Martin.
Maybe Martin's got it on him.
The whole Intelligence Department, and they can't find a paper.
Ha ha ha.
No sir.
There's nothing here.
Yes, sir. I'm positive.
Oh, all right.
Let it go.
I'll find it in the morning.
No. It's all right.
It doesn't matter.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Good night.
Confound these interruptions.
I suppose I'm terribly silly, but I am really frightened, Lieutenant.
But you mustn't be.
I'll see to it that you get all the protection in the world.
You see, after Charles was killed,
I had no one to turn to, no one to help me.
Ah, but that's no longer true.
I'd like you to feel that I'm your friend; that is, if you have no objection.
Oh! Will you excuse me a few moments while I make some repairs?
Well, as your newly elected bodyguard,
I shouldn't let you out of my sight.
We'll start our service of protection when I return.
Nieterstein got the circular.
Good.
Did you get any information about the rendezvous position of the ship?
I hardly had time.
Time is short. The Americans must be made to feel that it's safe to send a message.
Someone must be captured and the code book found on him.
Who is it to be?
We have decided on
Captain Nieterstein.
Does he know?
He was called away from here and given his instructions.
He's to appear to do his duty.
Use this.
When?
Immediately.
I'm afraid your friend Miss
Carter doesn't like me very much.
Well, that shows that she has exceedingly bad judgment.
Now, how about launching our friendship with a bottle of champagne?
Uh-uh. No.
None for me, thanks.
No?
Have you been decorated?
Oh, that. I found it in the lobby.
Captain Nieterstein.
Very careless of the Captain, dropping his military honors around in cafe lobbies.
Yes. Particularly, when he wasn't in uniform and wore no medals.
Oh! Why, that's true. I wonder why he carried this one with him.
Perhaps he's one of those men who go to bed with their medals on their pajamas.
Heh heh heh! I wonder if you'd be good enough to return it to the Captain for me.
Of course.
Oh!
Just a moment, please.
Why, that's strange.
Yes. Very strange...
For a military attache to be carrying a reagent.
What?
I hate to interrupt our dinner, but do you mind coming with me?
Where are we going?
Captain Nieterstein said that he was returning to the embassy, didn't he?
I believe so, yes.
Well, that's where we're going.
Won't you sit down?
Pardon me.
Mr. Carter, could you come with us to the embassy?
It's very urgent.
Why, of course.
Colonel Petroff, you won't mind seeing my niece home? Good night.
I should be delighted!
It's outrageous!
I realize that this is very irregular, your excellency.
If I'm wrong, your excellency need only report me to the State Department, and I'll be court-martialed.
Well. That at least will be some recompense.
I always pay off when I lose, sir.
But you yourself admit it that there is no official reason why Captain Nieterstein should possess a reagent.
The Captain has already assured you that the medal was stolen from him several days ago.
I doubt very much, sir, whether people steal medals merely to dip the ribbons in reagent.
I'm permitting you to proceed merely to prove how wrong you are.
And I shall look forward to your court-martial.
Lieutenant Gordon! Yes?
Would you look in that drawer?
Very useful, I should say, particularly, in wartimes.
Surely every man is entitled to a hobby.
This one happens to be mine.
Nicholas was always interested in electrical contraptions.
That proves nothing.
Lieutenant Gordon.
It's the official code.
I can't permit them to see it.
Naturally.
The Brennan code.
It's as simple as a-b-c.
The messages were intercepted with that and decoded with this.
Fairly complete, I'd say.
I'm sorry, papa Gregory.
I have only one explanation to make:
Mother was German.
You see how difficult this war has been for me.
You all have one country and fight for it.
I had two and had to choose for one and against the other.
Believe me, I did what
I thought was right.
Nicholas. Nicholas.
My compliments.
Lieutenant Gordon should be very proud of you.
But... but I didn't do anything.
I only found the medal.
I never expected... it's a great consolation to know you're so concerned about me.
It was an accident.
Believe that.
But I would have done it intentionally if I'd known.
You see, I, too, love my country.
I think we can go now.
Do you mind if I dress?
Of course not.
Aah!
War, my dear.
War... death...
Oh, it's horrible!
Why are such things?
They happen.
They always will, I'm afraid.
Your excellency,
I'm sorry, believe me.
I can't tell you how much I regret this.
But we're grateful, deeply grateful.
You've helped us trap the head of the... spy ring, and I shall see that your services are recognized.
I don't want recognition.
Do you think I want to go through life with something to remind me... would you care to go home now?
In a moment.
It'll be safe for you to send the rendezvous position now, sir.
I'll get back to the department and have it sent immediately. Good night.
Good night, sir.
Well... huh.
Here we are again.
I thought Colonel Petroff was seeing you home.
Well, you didn't expect me to spend the rest of the war with that... that amorous feather duster.
Don't you think it might be a good idea for you to go home for a change.
Hey, that's my Taxi!
Well, it's in the Army now.
The Andover Arms.
No, no.
The Park Hotel.
I moved after Charles was...
Uh, Taxi! Taxi!
What is the number of Miss
Karloff's room, please?
Miss Karloff is not in, Madam.
Oh, yes, she is.
I'm afraid, Madam is mistaken.
I just saw her come in here with Lieutenant Gordon.
I'll see, Madam.
Miss Karloff, please.
Hello? A lady just... very well.
I was mistaken.
Miss Karloff is in.
But she doesn't wish to be disturbed.
Oh, she doesn't wish to be disturbed.
Well, she's going to be.
And I'm just the girl to do it.
Miss Karloff is a very dangerous woman.
There's no telling what she'll do to Lieutenant Gordon.
My dear Miss... my name is Miss Joel Carter and my Uncle happens to be the Assistant Secretary of War.
If you don't show me which is Miss Karloff's room,
I'll call out the Army and the Navy!
And maybe a marine if he's needed.
Very well, Miss Carter, since you insist.
This gentleman will show you upstairs.
Thank you.
This way, please.
Uh, this lady wishes to see Miss Karloff.
This way, please.
I'm taking the message to Miss Karloff now.
Good.
Note for you, Miss Karloff.
Oh, thanks.
Excuse me.
Sure.
Bad news?
Oh, no. Just annoying.
Any answer, Miss Karloff?
Yes. Say that I can't see him until the morning.
Yes, Miss.
Oh, just a moment.
I'm not in the habit of receiving callers at this hour.
You received me.
Yes, but you're not a persistent suitor...
Unfortunately.
That's all.
Oh, just a minute, boy.
Surely the gentleman will expect a better answer than that.
You think so?
Won't he be disappointed?
Can you suggest anything better I could tell him?
Yes.
You might tell him that there's really nothing you can do about the new code.
I'm really not very good at riddles, Lieutenant.
Well... that's that.
My compliments to you and to Captain Nieterstein, a brave man.
But his sacrifice only convinced us that the Brennan code was useless and that we had to get a new one.
I'm from the Army
Intelligence Department.
I want you to take me to the man who gave you that message.
Yes, sir.
Miss Karloff, I think you'd better come with me, and you can deliver your answer personally.
All right. Go ahead.
Down...
I said down.
Get out.
Sorry, Lieutenant Gordon, but the fortunes of war... or the misfortunes.
In our business, there are always reverses, Lieutenant.
You recognize this, of course.
Some sort of code, I suppose?
This is the new American code, and you know it.
Unfortunately, the War Department doesn't tell me everything.
Come now, Lieutenant.
Everybody knows you're the code expert.
Only since
Major Brennan's removal.
Precisely. It would be very unfortunate if the process were to be repeated.
At least I shall have the satisfaction of knowing that when I do go, your only key to the code goes with me.
Lieutenant, I know that you accept what is... inevitable and the inevitable is that I get bumped off whether I decode that message or not.
So I'm not going to decode it.
You're quite right.
You will be...
"Bumped off" anyway, but I have an idea that you will decode the message because...
If you please.
As a soldier, you realize that an emergency requires emergency methods.
I don't know any emergency that requires warring on women.
I thought there was a code of decency even in war.
Unfortunately, Lieutenant, the situation is too acute for the usual amenities.
If I do decode this message, what guarantee have I that
Miss Carter will be released?
If you don't decode the message, you're sure of what will happen.
If you do, we have nothing to gain by keeping her here.
5 minutes after we get word that our U-Boats have located the rendezvous position, she will be released.
Another man did something like this once.
His name was Benedict Arnold.
This position is 1,000 Miles out of the regular sea lanes.
Unfortunately, that doesn't seem to be far enough.
You haven't forgotten that we will hold Miss Carter until the transport is located?
Hardly.
Now, since I'm about to make an abrupt departure,
I'd like to ask you to do a favor for me.
Of course.
I'd like to speak to Miss Carter.
In a short while, Lieutenant.
Thank you.
Long distance.
San Diego 2163 w.
Dr. Jackson.
Hello?
Yes?
Oh, it's you.
How are you?
Yes.
Fine.
That's splendid.
You need have no worry.
The medicine will reach the patient in 20 minutes.
Miss Carter is here.
Bring her in, then join us in the next room.
Very smart, Mr. Gordon.
Having me manhandled and gagged and pushed around while you play Russian bank with that... that blonde?
Who do you think you are?
Fu Manchu?
Joel, whether you heard about it or not, there's a war going on in Europe.
There's a war going on right in this room.
You have been making something of a nuisance of yourself, dear.
After all, I've had work to do.
You're standing there like a noble, long-suffering martyr just waiting for me to speak my peace and go.
You don't want to send me away, do you, Bill?
No, darling.
I must stay here for a while.
But I'll see you tomorrow?
Yes, dear.
You know, Bill, uh, I can't help being a little scatterbrained and giddy about you every... don't shoot.
Don't shoot.
It's Patrick O'Reilly from the Department of Justice.
I never shot a man by name of
Patrick O'Reilly in my life.
Here. No, you don't.
I'll have the handcuffs on you, me bucko.
Gordon!
All present and accounted for, Mr. Carter.
Get on your feet here.
Quick!
Take him out, boys.
How about the rest of our sewing circle?
Well, they're all present and accounted for, too.
Not quite all, sir.
Reilly.
Yes, sir.
There's a Dr. Jackson at San Diego 2163 w.
Yes, sir.
He's a transmitter.
Phone San Diego to get him.
Right away, sir.
Well, it was mighty accommodating of the Germans to send out this message telling me where you were.
Mr. Carter,
I staked everything on your deciphering that.
Yes, and you almost lost.
What saved you was my knowing that the first message we send out under the false code meant nothing, and so the Germans couldn't possibly have our rendezvous position.
How about my position?
Joel!
How long have you been hiding there?
Hiding? Huh!
Hiding?
He did it.
He hit me over the head with a hammer.
I what?!
He told me he loved me and then he hit me over the head with a hammer.
My dear child,
Gordon saved your life.
Hmm! The next thing you'll be telling me is that I was captured by the Germans.
Uh...
Joel...
Ah, don't you dare hit me again.
Joel, dear.
Well... can you read?
It's very interesting.
What is it?
Latitude 37 north, longitude 15 west.
In other words,
3715th street northwest.
The rendezvous position of the German spy ring.
Nonsense. That's the address of this hotel.
My sweet, when you were a little girl, were you ever dropped on anything?
Hmm.
Do you mean to tell me all those people were spies?
Ah...
Came the dawn.
Heh heh heh.
Then that woman well, I guess that ought to teach you a lesson, running around with a spy.
Well, Gordon, you said you wanted action.
How do you feel about it now?
I think it's swell.
You mean to say that you still want to go to war?
Why, I certainly do.
And don't forget, sir, you promised me that as soon as I finish this job,
I could go.
No, no, no, no, Uncle John.
Don't you dare let him go.
He's just trying to get out of marrying me.
And to think I could have had you shot.
Oh, darling, I think
I'll go along with you.
A wife's place is with her husband...
When he's in Paris.
Ah, but I'll be up at the front.
But you could come back over weekends.
Or we could get the Germans to come right down to Paris.
Then I wouldn't have to leave you at all.
No, darling. You can do just as much harm here as you could in Paris.
All aboard!
I hate good-byes, don't you?
Of course.
I wish you'd kiss me and leave me all of a sudden.
Then I could just stand right here and pretend you're gone for a package of cigarettes.
That's right, darling.
I've just left for a minute, and I'll be right back.
And while I'm gone, please be miserable and miss me and love me.
Lieutenant Gordon?
Yes.
Major Sloan's compliments, sir.
You're to report back at the war office at once for duty.
Richard Bogard.
- Yes.
American, eh?
- Yes, sir.
You got a bit more than you bargained for crossing, what?
Your torpedo was actually fired.
Good show, eh. Nice to have watched, for you Americans.
Well, I hope you don't see more than you want.
Purpose of visit?
Just looking around.
Sympathies in the war?
None, that is ..
- Neutral. That's all.
You've passed.
And there.
I am sure the place will meet with your requirements.
When would you like possession?
Just as soon as they are willing to vacate.
They will be happy to do so at once.
The owner is at the front.
Naturally, his income has stopped.
His son is in training and only the daughter is left.
I feel rather like a villain throwing the daughter out and that sort of thing.
It must be rather difficult for her.
England is at war, Mr Bogard.
There is the address.
Father.
Oh.
The gentleman is here, Miss.
Mr Bogard the name is.
I'll send him away, Miss?
- No.
No, I'll see him.
- No, Miss. No.
It's ..
It's a long way from London and .. he ..
He might not want to come back again.
When I ring for the tea.
No blubbering.
Mind not.
Miss Boyce-Smith?
- Yes.
My name is Bogard.
How do you do.
I have just been admiring your view.
Those old trees. They are very old, aren't they.
Yes, very.
This is just like I hoped it would be.
You've lived here all your life have you?       - Yes.
I thought so.
You seem to fit in somehow.
Are these your brothers?
Yes. One of them.
That's my father.
Yes. They told me he was in service.
- Yes.
Shall we have tea?
Yes. Thank you.
Cigarette?
- Thank you.
You know, I'm just beginning to realize what this is all about.
We don't know there is a war going on, we Americans.
No.
It's getting pretty close to you with your father .. and brother.
And now a stranger moving in.
Is tea ready?
Yes .. Miss.
Thank you.
I suppose now that you are giving up your home.
You are going away?
No.
No, I've moved my things to the gardener's cottage on The Place.
Oh.
I see.
Please don't worry about me, Mr Bogard.
I'll be quite alright.
Thank you.
How will you have your tea?
Just sugar please.
Will you fetch the sugar, Wendy.
- Yes.
It's there, Miss.
Thank you.
How many?
I've been very stupid.
I forgot that your sugar was rationed.
I've already put it in.
You have so little.
Why do you give it to me?
Why shouldn't you have it?
I'm sorry. I couldn't drink it now.
Shall I show you the rest of the house?
Thanks.
Is .. that the library?
That is my father's study.
May I see it?
Of course.
This is perfect.
You shoot too?
Sometimes.
Hello boy.
Your father's?
- Yes.
He's even burnt the table with cigarettes.
That's what a study is for, isn't it.
Do as you please.
Be comfortable.
Must you do that?
Must you?
Sorry. I didn't ..
- Oh, don't.
I'm the one to apologize.
You see .. it's only because ..
This has always been my father's room and ..
I'm not going to ask you to show me any more.
I've been thoughtless. I didn't realize.
I promise to take good care of all these.
If you .. excuse me.
Please make yourself comfortable.
As to the room.
I only hope you enjoy it.
My father did.
Look here.
Everybody seems to be rather upset about my coming.
If the servants worry about losing their jobs, tell them I'll keep them will you.
It isn't that, sir.
It's the master.
They've just had word that he's been killed.
What?
I see.
Men of England. Hail.
Your bodies are buried in peace.
But your name liveth for evermore.
I gave them permission, Diana.
They asked me if you'd mind.
Mind?
No.
Not tonight.
Just when I think I can't cry anymore.
I haven't any tears left.
I surprise myself.
Again.
Oh, he was so fine.
Why did he have to go? Why?
I've answered that question as many times as there are names there.
And the answer satisfies no-one.
Not even me.
I don't know, but ..
There are times in the lives of women even more than in those of men.
When they must have a sublime, unreasoning faith.
But I haven't any faith.
I don't even hope.
Just a lot of silly tears that come rushing out.
When I least expect.
Father is dead.
There is room for more names.
Soon, Ronnie and Claude will be there too.
They haven't gone yet, Diana.
His name is Ronnie. Your brother.
Mine is Claude.
Little boy from next door.
Ronnie.
Ronnie.
Thanks.
I shan't be satisfied with this long arm. Demand my rights.
Claude.
Padre, hello.
I can hardly believe that you're here.
I've something to show you.
The village did it for father.
Remember the time you slipped with the communion wine, Ronnie?
It was just there.
Under the plate by old Daddy's pew.
And father passed the empty glass.
All down the way as if nothing had happened.
Dad gave me his hymn book to hide my sniggering.
He laughed after it was all over.
I wonder what he'd say.
If he knew we were shoving off in five hours.
He'd say:
"It's worth a world war to get a uniform like that".
Or he'd say: "Five hours? How can the Admirals spare you?"
"A grand celebration and talk of .."
- "Cabbages and Kings."
And give us his best wine.
- And drink us all under the table.
Five hours, Ann.
Five hours?
How can the Admirals spare you?
Then we're off.
Tea, Padre?
- No thanks.
This time belongs to you.
- You are family, you know.
Yes, thanks. I'll say goodbye now.
Good luck.
Good luck.
- Thanks.
Say one of your best prayers for us, Padre.      - I will that.
How do you find your American, Ann?
Oh.
Rich.
Neutral.
Out of things.
Sort-of safe.
This is home now.
Jolly, isn't it.
I'll go say hello to Applegate.
- Oh Ronnie, wait a minute.
You'd better not. You'd better let me tell her first.
I'll need this.
Upstairs if you want to tidy up.
I say Ann, I hope you didn't rent all the Scotch to the American.
I should say not. I'll get some.
Applegate.
- Hmm?
Ronnie and Claude are here.
Oh.
Here. Now time just for a quick one. Come on.
They go tonight.
Going, Miss?
- Yes.
Going? Oh, Miss ..
- I said a quick one.
Besides, they go at nine.
Who's going to get dinner?
I am, Miss.
Poor lambs.
Half starved. That's what they is.
Applegate.
When they go.
Mind not.
I won't mind, Miss.
I don't need this anymore.
Stout fellow.
Hear, hear.
Hey. Hey, get out of here will you.
Will not.
Of course, you're a big girl now.
I'm starting tomorrow morning bright and early being a big girl.
I haven't time now.
Hey, bartender.
Thank you, milady.
- Right.
He's still a kid to you, isn't he.
Why not?
You think just because you wear an officer's tunic you're grown up?
Ann.
Hmm?
This morning, when commissions and orders came.
He said, get Ronnie.
Officer now. Navy.
Now I can ask her.
Well?
He counts on it.
Awful knock if you let him down.
Won't let him down.
Good girl.
Ronnie, when you say "good girl" to me.
It feels just like jumping over Robin Hood's barn.
Don't take too much of our five hours will you.
No.
I never thought I'd live to see the day.
There I was.
And the Queen not two feet away.
No further than from here to there.
And talking to me just like I was her sister.
I never thought I'd live to see the day.
That's remarkable, isn't it.
Have another.
Have one yourself.
- That I will.
I've had one already. That makes two.
Hear, hear. I have things to say.
We've no secrets from Ronnie, have we.
Not one.
Remember what we said? That when the time came and I asked you ..
You would say without a lot of fuss ..
"Right, Claude".
Or.
Stay, Claude.
I do.
And we promised whatever you said.
That we three would be just the same.
Yes.
Well?
Well, Ann?
Right, Claude.
Oh, I say.
I say, Ronnie. Did you hear? Did you?
It's "right".
- Told you it would be.
Glad.
I don't know what to do.
I haven't a ring. I should have a ring, shouldn't I, Ann.
We'll trade. Our names are inscribed.
Then each ring will mean two things.
- Good. Good idea.
Here Ronnie, you must be in on this. Yours, Ann.
You ought to say something, Claude.
Something important.
Go ahead. Say it.
I can't think of anything important.
I can only think of silly things.
- Well then, say silly things.
Must say something.
I ..
Say ..
Go ahead.
I know what your father would say.
- Say it.
"The time has come the walrus said, to talk of many things".
"Of shoes and ships and sealing wax, of cabbages and kings."
"And why the sea should boil in .."
[ Clock chimes ]
What hails?
- Drink hearty.
Master Ronnie.
Now take care of her, Applegate.
Make her toe the mark.
You know, girls have no sense.
I know, master Ronnie.
I'll take care of her.
Well.
- Well?
I suppose you want me to kiss you goodbye.
You don't have to if you don't want to.
Guess I'd better.
Better had.
Silly business, though.
Well.
Better finish this by letter.
Train might not wait.
Good girl.
See, Miss .. I didn't cry.
You may cry now.
Hello.
- Hello.
You are late this morning.
- Am I?
Every morning this week you left at ten.
So I waited.
Nice of you.
You don't mind my riding with you?
Not at all.
I'm riding to Valleysmith.
The view from the hill is nice.
Oh, you've seen it?
Naturally.
Of course.
I was going to ask you to ride there with me.
I'm going to the village.
Applegate has lost her darning egg.
Darning egg?
- Uhuh.
She's had it for thirty years.
That's too bad.
- Yes, isn't it.
Valleysmith is that way.
Village over here.
I suppose I ought to say something good about our roads dividing.
Well?
I suppose you can get darning eggs at Valleysmith?
Afraid not.
Cheero.
Is that "cheerio" or "cheero"?
"Cheero".
Well, cheero.
Well .. hello.
Applegate can use a bottle for a darning egg.
My grandmother used to use a little gourd.
It rattled.
Do you find England like America?
Countries are such silly things, aren't they.
Just places on maps with ..
Exports and tariffs and queer places to visit.
They don't mean much to you until you get tied up with them through people.
I thought the war was silly, too.
Never believed in it until now.
Does that mean ..
You're going in?
If they'll let me.
Why?
Because I love you.
I was going to say it a little further along.
Kinda work up to it.
Talking about England.
But I do love you.
I know it.
Cheero.
Ann.
Please.
Please forget what I told you this afternoon.
I'll never forget it.
Because I love you too.
What time did she leave?
She took the evening train to
London, sir. In an awful hurry.
And you don't know where they were going?    - No, sir.
No more did she.
It's the ambulance service.
She hopes she'll be sent somewhere near her brother.
She'll write back, sir.
Goodnight, Mrs Applegate.
Look, Ronnie!
Hi, sailors.
Ronnie .. you're here.
On the way up I kept saying you wouldn't be, you couldn't be here.
So I wouldn't be disappointed.
The Admiral's sub couldn't have kept us away.    - Yes.
He made us run the last
4 squares to get here.
Did you, Ronnie?
Aren't you going to kiss me?
What for? Never kissed you in my life.
Look at you.
You dress up to meet me?
What you look like every day.
No time, Ann.
You should have seen us scraping the mud off this gold braid.
Listen. I'll report and
I'll be right with you.
Different already, isn't it.
Here it is.
Got the key?
- Hmm.
Well, as Applegate would say, I never thought I would live to see the day.
Room fit for a Queen.
All the comforts of home.
Every convenience milady.
Ah .. Chippendale.
Illumination.
I wonder what's in here.
- Find out.
What-oh, feather beds.
Running water. Cold and colder.
Hey.
- What?
A nest of mice. Non-nibblers.
Beaver! Look, Anne. Help me.
- What is it?
Cockroach. There he goes, up your way.
- Quick, quick.
Where?
- Get him.
Get him, Ann.
- He's heading back to you, Claude.
Here he is. Here he is.
There he goes, there he goes. There.
Don't hurt him.
- No, I won't.
I have him.
I have him.
Ah, he's a beauty.
- Looks like a born fighter, eh.
Who will he fight?
Remember Jamie Wetherspoon?
- Hmm.       - He has a roach.
The best fighter in the division.
They're betting 3-1 on him.
I'd bet on this fellah.
Bring him out.
- Okay.
Ronnie, get a glass. Quickly. Quickly.
There. Got him.
- Hmm.
Jamie calls his "Bonaparte".
Have to get a name for this one. What will it be?
Bonaparte?
Duke or Duchess?
The Duke Of Wellington.
Wellington.
That's just the thing.
Two nice things in one day, Ann.
You and Wellington.
Refuse to share honours with a cockroach.
We'll drink to you first.
- Nice of you.
I'll get a bottle and we'll celebrate?
- Right.
Don't move.
Stay here.
Just like that.
I'll come back pretending you're not here.
And there you'll be.
It will be fun all over again, won't it.
- Yes.
Fun all over again.
Stay there.
I'll be right back.
They don't make them any better, do they.
No.
Poor Ronnie.
Ronnie, what is it?
- Nothing .. sore.
You've been hit?
- Nicked a bit.
Alright now. Almost well.
Oh Ronnie.
- Steady.
It's been bad?
How bad has it been?
- No lark.
Not so bad for me. Worse for Claude.
You've never written what you do you know.
I couldn't. The censor.
It's hush-hush stuff.
Silly. I'll tell you later why.
Do you often run into this sort of thing?
Sometimes show gets pretty warm.
Tell me about Claude.
- Told you.
I'm alright.
I'm older. Dull.
Claude's not dull. He's quick.
He's missed you, Ann. Lots.
It's always Ann with Claude.
He drinks too much.
You're here now.
Yes.
Yes, I'm here now.
And you need me.
Both of you.
You do need me, don't you?
- Hmm.
Something to tell me, Ann?
You always know, don't you, Ronnie.
What is it?
The chap that took the house.
I love him.
Thought so.
Your letters.
I couldn't help it, Ronnie.
I tried, but ..
- You can't help feelings, Ann.
You can't change love.
You'd have liked him too, Ronnie.
I know you would.
Sure I would.
You'd not have liked him yourself otherwise.
But it's all over now.
Finished.
I have you and Claude and ..
I don't want anything else.
Truly I don't.
Claude's young.
Time to get over it.
I didn't want you to say that.
I wanted you to understand.
I do.
Then don't ask me to let Claude down.
Not when things are like they are.
Stop feeling them.
That's what I wanted you to say.
Say it again.
Ronnie.
He kissed me.
Right.
Steady now.
Hi, sailor.
Hi.
Ann.
In here.
Hello.
- Hello.
Get enough sleep?
Do we ever?
- No.
How about a cup of tea?
- Had mine.
I meant how about my poaching a cup.
- In there.
Pretty strong by now.
Don't need it strong this morning.
Another day of it, they say.
Three days now.
Wounded coming in in car loads.
I don't know where they'll put them.
They're turning the churches into hospitals.
Hello.
- Hello.
Have a cup of tea or what was tea?
- No thanks.
May I speak with Ann a minute?
Of course.
Don't be long though, Ann.
We're late now.
Is it ..?
Is it Claude?
No, not Claude.
Is it ..?
"Richard Bogard."
Richard.
He's dead before I even learned to say his name.
Coming, Ann?
Waiting for you.
Ronnie.
Ronnie, I can't go.
Really, I can't.
Yes you can.
It's no good, Ronnie. Can't.
Ronnie, don't make me go, please.
Ronnie, don't. Don't make me go.
Please. Can't.
Ronnie.
I can't.
That's a terrible looking hat, Ann.
Dropped it in the soup.
Yesterday.
Good girl.
Boulogne is pretty hot at this time, Ronnie.
We tried though.
One thousand capsules 5-grain quinine.
Thirty gallons disinfectant.
Four dozen dark-eyed glasses.
Twelve gross diphtheria antitoxin.
Ten thousand units.
Twelve gross ..
Forget it.
Twelve gross tetanus antitoxin.
Fifteen thousand units.
Twelve boxes hypodermic needles.
Ann.
"Donald Osborne, aged 19."
What will I say this time?
What difference does it make?
No matter what you say it will break her heart.
Twelve only surgical gloves.
Ten gallons, tincture of iodine.
Ten gallons tincture of iodine.
Stop it.
I just told the poor mother her "iodine" has been killed.
Five gross safety pins.
Five only safety razors.
Alright girls. Need more help. Coming in faster than we can handle them.
Get out and get all the stretchers down to the north face.
I can't.
I can't go out there.
Yes you can.
Come on.
Goodnight, Alma.
Goodnight, Ann.
Goodnight, Mary.
Come on, youngsters.
Sailor.
Sailor.
Four o'clock, sailor.
I know.
Shouldn't have done this.
I broke my promise and drank too much.
I'm alright now, though.
Do you go out again tomorrow?
Uhuh.
What is it this time?
Don't know yet.
Special.
Special means "bad", doesn't it.
Maybe.
I can't tell yet.
Is it tomorrow's job, Claude?
Is that why you ..
Why you waited for me?
It's not that alone.
It's lots of things.
I'm not holding together, Ann.
I'm all mixed up.
No secrets.
Have we Claude?
- I'm afraid, Ann.
Afraid of what?
Going out in the boat.
I think about .. coming back to you.
Just the way I did coming from school.
You were always there, waiting.
But lately, it's different.
I don't know.
You've gone away somewhere.
Not here.
Then.
There's nothing to come back to.
Claude.
Ann is here again.
Always will be.
Always.
No-one in the world I love so much.
Except Ronnie.
Believe me, sailor?
Sure?
Sure.
Come along.
Have Lieutenants Boyce-Smith and Hope come in yet?
Not yet, Miss. Just had a telephone from the lookout.
Said one of the boats has just entered the harbour.
Maybe it's them, Miss.
- Thank you.
Get a stretcher will you.
- Yes, sir.
Stretcher needed. Stretcher.
There you go, Bert.
- Aye-aye, sir.
What's the matter with you? Get the stretcher down. Hurry up.
Ronnie, are you alright?
- Hello, Ann.
Alright. Up in a moment.
Steady there.
Here you are, boys.
- Alright.
Anyone else in yet?
- Mr Witherspoon, sir.
Trust Jamie.
He always gets the first drink.
Bert, look here.
- Aye-aye, sir.
Better see to that before you leave.
Aye-aye, sir.
Ronnie.
Hello.
- Hello.
Make a hit?
- Yes.      - Glad.
Been waiting.
I was ..
Ronnie.
May I speak with Claude a moment?
Right.
Did you tell him?
- No.
I wanted to.
Suppose he hates it?
We must tell him.
We've no secrets.
- Right.
I'll tell him.
- No.
It's my due.
We'll be married as soon as it's all over.
If it ever is.
Ronnie.
Remember when we were tykes?
Messing about the brook and all?
She said she would marry me.
You remember.
How we all said it. All three of us.
And then when we were bigger.
How we talked about it being in the chapel.
Padre.
And veils and wreaths.
The music of the voice that breathes over Eden.
You remember.
We were still children then, Ronnie.
We're not children anymore.
She's not. I'm not.
That chapel and Padre seem a million miles away.
There is no Eden any more.
And to wear, it's khaki .. not veils.
We didn't wait, Ronnie.
I know it.
Ronnie.
You knew?
- Uhuh.
And.
And you don't ..
You don't hate me?
Hate?
Ronnie.
That's twice you've kissed me.
[ Buzzer ]
[ Buzzer ]
Who can that be, I wonder.
Alright, alright. I'm coming.
Just give a body a chance.
[ Buzzer ]
Yes, I'm coming.
If you could only see me.
If you could see me coming, you wouldn't need to ring.
Now what do you ..?
Mr Bogard. Mr Bogard.
Hello, Mrs Applegate.
- Mr Bogard.
Ain't you a ghost? You're dead, sir.
Nope. They overestimated me.
Ann? I came to see her.
Lord, Lordy, sir. I'm very sorry.
Why we thought you was dead, sir.
Does that feel dead?
Come. Pull yourself together,
Applegate. I'm in a hurry.
I came to find out about Miss Ann.
She's in France, sir.
Miss Ann, my own dovey, being shot at by them Germans.
Yes. I know she is in France, but where?
I don't know, sir.
When we writes, we addresses the letters to the Officer's Unit in Boulogne.
It's a private unit, sir.
I see. And her brother ..?
Well he is where she is, sir.
And Mr Claude, too.
Wherever you'll find one of them, you'll find the other two, sir.
I see.
Lord, sir. I thought you was a ghost.
I never thought I'd live to see the day.
Sit down, Bogey.
Walking around won't help any.
What is it?
- He wants whiskey, sir.
Why don't you get it?
There, what did I tell you? Any guy that wants whiskey ain't dead, is he.
No, but ..
- Oh shut up. Sit down.
Sit down. Go on, go on. Anybody would think it was your fault.
That's three front gunners in two weeks.
Miller and Jordan last week and now ..
Davis. In there.
Forget it. It's not your fault about Davis.
Anybody would think you hunted up those Huns and flew right into them.
Besides, Davis is not gone yet.
Not gone yet?
Did you see the blood coming out of his mouth when they pulled him out of there?
Well .. go on. Say it.
Hello, Bogey. Can you use this?
Richard.
Don't be afraid, Ann.
Richard.
Oh, Richard.
Oh, they told me you were dead.
And I believed them.
Just now, I thought I was dead too.
But we're not.
We're alive.
Richard, we're alive.
It was when the ship spun and the controls were gone.
And afterwards in the hospital.
I was listening to them say
I'd die. I knew I wouldn't.
I couldn't. Not without seeing you.
- Oh, darling.
Darling.
I dreamed once that you were alive.
That you were calling to me.
I tried to answer.
I woke internally.
Richard.
Why did they tell me you were dead?
You're not dead after all.
But I am.
Stop it.
Stop it.
- No. Let me go.
Let me go.
- Wait a minute, Bogey. Wait.
Look at me.
- No.
Look Miss. I don't know what it's all about.
But I do know it's time to cut the motors and stall her down.
You're telling him "no". Is that it?
Is that right?
I'm trying to tell him ..
Well that sounds final enough.
You'd better go, Miss. Go on.
Go on .. go on.
Wait, Ann.
- Wait, Bogey.
She doesn't want you to follow her. Anyone can see that.
Now take it easy ..
- Let go of me, let go of me!
Hold it will you. Hold it.
Now Listen, take it easy. Take time.
Think it over. Then, if you want ..
We can find her. It's a cinch.
She's in Ambulance.
We'll go to town tonight.
Come on, I need a drink too.
Come on.
Look at all these trucks. You're blocking the road down there.
Come on, will you.
Come on.
Come on, come on.
- Scram, you guys.
Get right out of here.
- Come on.
What's the trouble, Corporal?
Stand up. They're officers.
Your name is not Beatty, I hope.
No.
- Hoped not.
My mistake.
No offence.
- What's he been doing?
Well you see, sir. Them trucks was jammed up for about three blocks.
Then I come up and find this egg here.
You're talking about one of his
Majesty's officers, my man.
That will do, Corporal.
Well I find this ..
He had gone to bed in the middle of the road with an empty basket for a blanket.
Laying there with hands under his head and knees crossed ..
Arguing with the drivers whether he ought to move or not.
He said the street was his.
Why don't you take him back to the ship?
- I thought of that.
He said he puts the ship away at night.
Puts it away?
- Yes, sir.
Stand up, sailor.
Maybe the Captain can make sense out of it.
Darned if I can.
He says they keep the boat under a wharf at night ..
And can't get it out until the tide goes out in the morning.
Under a wharf? A boat?
- Yes, sir.
What is this?
You've seen those launches, camouflaged and all, dashing up and down the harbour?
They do that all day and sleep in the gutters here all night.
You mean to say they use officers to ..
Search me. Maybe they use them to fetch hot water from one ship to another.
Or to carry napkins for the Admiral or something like that. I don't know.
I see.
Alright Corporal, carry on.
This man will take care of him.
Hey, dog-face.
You take him.
And I hope you'll keep him from using the street for a bed.
That will do, Corporal.
You know where he lives?
- Probably a place up the road, sir.
You come to the crossroad, turn into a little court and count four houses.
Come, Bogey. We'll get him home. Won't take long.
Why bother with him?
He's just a kid. I got a brother about his age. Come on, take his other arm.
Come on, now. Upsy-daisy.
Upsy-daisy. That's the baby.
See the little birdie?
See it?
He's sure got a beauty.
Maybe they give 'em the little boats to play with ..
To keep the gutters clear during the day.
Come on.
Yeah, this it. Come on, buddy.
Ann?
They told us ..
It's a mistake of course.
We were looking ..
Come on, Bogey. Let's get him in.
No, wait. We've made a mistake. This isn't ..
Go on, sister. Tell him and get it over with.
No .. it isn't a mistake.
This is the right place.
Bring him in.
- Sure.
Where to, sister?
So this is what you meant when you said you'd died.
Well, he's not dead at any rate.
And he's not likely to be hurt in that little boat of his.
Sorry, sister.
Come on, Bogey.
You take a lot of killing, don't you. Come on.
Come on.
Short, sweet and promising, eh?
- Yes.
Hey Bogey, you see this?
- Yes.
What's the idea of drawing lots in secret?
Just a new way to kill a guy, maybe.
Not a bad idea at that. Keep it secret.
May not even know yourself you're dead.
Come on, Bogey.
- Where you going?
Town.
- Wait. I'll go with you.
Thanks, just the same.
Come on, Wellington.
At him again, Wellington.
Well struck!
Come on, Wellington.
Come on Wellington, my boy.
Wellington wins!
A good fight, eh?
Hello.
I say, you're the chaps who took me home last night, aren't you.
I guess I was out of it and didn't have a chance to thank you.
I can do it now.
May I get you a drink?
Sure.
- Come on.
Take care of Wellington for me, will you.         - Right.
Madame.
Whiskey, whiskey. One, two, three.
Whiskey.
Ha. Speak French like a native, eh.
Oh I say, you fly don't you?
- Yes.
I've never flown myself.
Been on a mountain though.
Liked being high.
Flying.
A risky sport, eh?
Yes. Sport.
- A bit dangerous isn't it?
A little more than being on a mountain.
Yet you command a vessel.
Well, it's hardly a vessel.
Nice, though.
I'm not in command. Ronnie does that.
He ranks me a bit.
- Ronnie?
Yes, the chap I run with.
Good egg. Bit of a stickler though.
A stickler?
Yes. You'd not believe it, but whenever we sight smoke.
And I have the glass, he always sheers away.
He keeps the ship held down, you know.
I can't get a beaver then.
He's had me two down for a fortnight.
Down? Beaver?    - Yes.
- What do you mean?
He means: beaver.
Bottoms up.
- Right.
Well you see, we play it with basket masks.
Whenever you see a basket mask, why: beaver. You're one up.
The JurgenStrasse doesn't count anymore.
I see.
So when you or Ronnie see a ship with a basket mask.
One gets the beaver on the other, huh?
- Right.
What is the JurgenStrasse?
Oh, she's a German, interned in the harbour.
Her fore-mast is rigged something like a basket.
You know, booms and cables and whatnot.
Ronnie called 'em once. They shifted her across the bay. I called her on Ronnie.
So we decided not to count her any more, see.
I see.
You and Ronnie run about in a launch and play beaver.
Did you ever play ..
Take your hand away.
Sure I will .. when?
Get me?
You've never flown you say?
- No.
Always wanted to, though.
- Should you like to try it?
Should I?
You mean it?
When?
Now. Tonight.
- Should I?
I say, wait. I'll get Wellington.
What's the idea?
What are you going to do?
I'm going to show him something about war.
Oh lay off. I mean it. He's just a kid.
He's old enough to know what it's all about.
Here we are getting shot at by the clock and it's not even our fight.
Shut up. You sound like a liberty law.
He's treating it like it's a tea party or something.
I'd like to catch him and his Ronnie.
Out on the harbour sometime.
Any harbour.
I wouldn't want anything but a Jenny either.
A Jenny.
I'll take a bicycle and a pair of water wings. I'll show him some war.
Sure, sure. Take him along. Let him have
Davis's place up in the front cockpit.
That would be just swell.
- But Mack.
I know you don't want him hurt and he's taking the same chances as we are but ..
But what?
Ah well.
- Here we are.
Wellington has never flown either. Look at him.
A big fellow isn't he.
You don't know who I am, do you.
Yes. The chap who fetched me home last night.
I thanked you.
I can thank you again though.
- My name I mean.
No.
It's Bogard.
Bogard?
You're the chap who took the house aren't you?
They reported you dead.
You're not dead .. I'm glad.
No, I'm not dead.
Shall we start?
- Right.
Remember, you've done this before.
Have I?
Oh, quite. Yes.
Fellows.
This is Lieutenant Hope.
He is going up with me.
This is Moore, Skipworth, Jenkins.
- How do you do.
Morehouse.
- Hello.
Alexander.
- Hello.    - Rondell.
I hope you enjoy.
- I'm sure I will.
Pretty decent of you chaps to let me go for a ride.
Drink?
Yes, thanks.
Get him some gear, will you.
Ready on the line, sir.
Alright fellows, hit the deck.
Hit the deck.
Here you are, Bogey,
- Thanks.
Here, Hope. Put this on.
Oh, shall I need it? Never worn one before you know.
Sure. Cold upstairs.
Don't talk. They'll get wise.
Oh.
Say, it will keep Wellington cosy, what.
Yeah, absolutely.
Where's the Admiral from, Bogey?
The Scotch Navy, usually.
There you are kid, you're alright.
Take care of that.
- Do you want coffee, sir?
No he doesn't. Get something else for tonight.
Coffee makes a confounded stain on the wings.
The wings?
You pour coffee on the wings?
- You'll see ..
Let’s do it, Mack. Come on.
Give me a bottle, Dave.
This is ours. I'll be with you in a minute. Mack will show you in.
Come on.
I say, it's big isn't it.
- What?
I say it’s big.
Yeah.
I can't believe it flies all in one lump.
It does.
You ride up front.
Bogey and I are here.
Harper protects the tail.
Now listen.
If you feel yourself getting sick.
Take a pull of this.
Shall I get sick?
- Sure.
We all do. Part of flying.
This will stop it.
But if it doesn't.
- What?
Don't spew it overside.
Not overside?
- No.
Blows back in Bogey's and my faces.
We can't see. Bingo.
We're finished. See?
Oh, quite.
What shall I do with it?
Just duck your head and let her go.
I say, that will be in my lap.
Quite. See.
Quite.
- Alright.
Get down there.
Lean forward.
That's the Vickers gun.
The gunnery Sergeant will be along in a minute.
He'll show you how to load it.
Hey!
It's loaded.
Oh, it's alright.
I pointed it west before I let it off.
There's nothing back there but your Brigade Headquarters.
By the way, my name is Claude.
I don't think I told you.
Oh, this is going to be swell.
I hope everything is working out just the way you wanted it to.
There isn't a Hun squadron between the coast and Ypres ..
That hasn't already already drawn lots for us.
They've shaved, eaten breakfast and sit round waiting to get us on the way back.
[ German language ]
[ German language ]
[ German language ]
He's not even scared.
I am, though. Plenty.
Come on, get out of here.
We had no business going so low.
I ought to report you.
Go ahead and report.
Huh?
Bomb.
Bomb.
It hangs loose.
Ah, sit down.
Tell him to stand by his guns.
Get back.
- A bomb.
Yeah. They were bombed.
We gave them all we had.
Get back to your guns.
Bomb alright?
- Yeah, alright.
Get back to your guns.
- Right.
Wellington.
- What?
Wellington likes this.
- Get back to your guns.
Daylight soon.
Every Hun and their whole channel group will be on us then.
Want me to take her?
Something's wrong with that left wing.
I'm flying on aileron and a little rudder.
Feel it.
Maybe your wire is hot.
Watch it. Keep that wing up.
Here they come.
They look like mosquitoes in September.
I hope he don't start letting that gun flop around and shoot back this way.
Sorry.
See what he said? He said: "I'm sorry".
I say, what a chap.
What a judge of distance.
If Ronnie could only have seen it. Are they like ours?
Do they load themselves as soon as the air strikes them?
What? Don't what load?
- The bomb. It's magnificent.
I shan't ever forget it.
The bomb?
That left wing.
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.
I was frightened myself.
I tried to tell you of it but realized you knew your business better than I.
Skill .. marvellous.
I say, I shan't ever forget it.
Oh, Mack.
They got Wellington.
I waited. Did you find him?
I looked in a café.
They said he'd been there.
Went out with some air-chap.
American. Can't understand.
Ronnie.
It was Bogard.
Bogard?
Yes.
Wasn't killed.
Mistake.
Met him at the hospital.
Told him it was over.
Not why, though.
That night he brought Claude home.
He hated me.
Hated Claude too.
Thought Claude was "safe".
Thought about the boat like everybody else.
His face.
Ronnie, it's safe .. looking at me.
He didn't understand.
Oh Ronnie.
I have to let go to you.
I've no-one else.
Let go.
Oh, I loved him.
Can't help it.
Tried, tried terribly.
Stop trying, Ann.
Stop trying?
Can't help feelings.
Claude's young. He'll get over it.
Tell him "mistake Claude".
Too late.
It's past that.
I only want him to understand.
I only want not to remember his face as it was.
Hating me.
That's all I want, Ronnie.
Friends, brothers, elks and beavers.
I come before you
not to bury Wellington.
But to praise him.
Hear, hear.
We are gathered together on this solemn occasion to bid farewell ..
Farewell?
Farewell.
I can't stand it, Lieutenant. I can't.
Have a drink.
I can't stand much more of it either.
- Audrey.
To the only cockroach in the allied armies who fought Richthofen.
Now we'll have the doxology.
Johnny.
Johnny, get back there and play it as you've never played before.
Make it good, boys. Make it good.
[ Singing: ]
"Under a Belgian water tank, the young observer lay."
"As his comrades gathered about him."
"These parting words he did say."
Say, Bogey.
Somebody wants to see you.
Thanks.
Captain Bogard?
I'm Boyce-Smith.
Hello.
I was looking for Hope here, and I see he's alright.
Why did you look for him here?
- My sister said he'd be here.
She told you that?
- Yes.
What else did she tell you about me?
I apologise. I shouldn't have asked that.
Thanks.
I say, will you ..
Will you come with us on the boat today?
Did Ann ..?
Did your sister tell you to ask me that?
Yes.
Why do you want me to come?
Did you tell Claude why?
You're right .. I'll come.
At two, what. I'll leave word with the sentry to pass you in to port.
I'll be there.
I want you to meet my friend, McGinnis.
A beaver, what?
So .. so you're going to spend the afternoon with the children, eh?
Or should I say "eh what"?
Some guy has said that a brave man is a fool who don't know when to be scared.
Meaning which?
Go on, finish.
That's all. I never even said it.
I was only going to remark I'd have showed him what the war was like.
Well then, don't.
- Sure.
Excuse me for stepping on your toes, General.
You haven't. Just shut up.
- Sure, General.     - And stay shut up.
Sure, General. Excuse me, General.
Have a nice time, General.
Lieutenant Boyce-Smith.
Down at the boat, sir.
Oh, just a minute, sir.
From Lieutenant McGinnis for the Captain, sir.
Hello there.
Well, here she is.
So you came. Thanks.
Did you think I wouldn't?
Or don't you go out in the rain?
Oh, it doesn't matter much. Come aboard.
Careful.
Take that little seat up forward.
Not much to look at is she.
Do the best we can.
Shall we shove off?
Any time.
Ready forward?
- Aye-aye, sir.
Ready aft?
- Aye-aye, sir.
Cast off.
Cast off, men.
Look. See?
What? See what?
The JurgenStrasse.
They've shifted her again.
If Ronnie would only call her I'd just be one down.
He didn't see it. Maybe he will on the way back, though.
You've got lots of time.
- Yes.
He's been ahead since we were ten years old.
Always ahead.
I've cut it to two now though.
I only hope he sees it.
I say, will you be warm? I never thought to fetch another one of these.
I'm alright.
- Here.
No, no. I won't take it.
You'll tell me if you get cold?
- Yes. Sure.
Are we outside now?
- Yes.
I mean, are we outside the harbour?
Quite. Where do you think we went?
Listen. Where are we going? How far?
It's Ronnie's show. He thought of it.
I told him about last night.
He said: "flying all night".
"That must have been to Berlin".
I said I didn't know.
Well he thought and I waited.
I said we couldn't take you to Berlin in a boat.
It's too far. Besides, we don't know the way.
He said: but we could go to Kiel.
I knew then ..
- To Kiel, in this?
Oh, absolutely. Ronnie said no fun for you unless we did.
Listen.
What is this boat for?
What does it do?
For?
- Yes.
That's a torpedo, isn't it?
I thought you knew.
- No. I didn't know.
How do you fire it?
Well, you pull this lever here and it drops out astern.
As soon as the screw touches the water ..
The torpedo is loaded.
And all you have to do is turn the boat quickly.
And the torpedo goes on.
I see.
You aim the torpedo with the boat.
And release it. Then if you don't turn out of the way, it's just too bad, huh?
I knew you'd catch on.
Ready?
Yes. Ready.
The channel into the harbour.
Full of mines.
A pattern on all sides and beneath us too.
Englander torpedo boat.
[ German language ]
[ German language ]
Fire.
Two.
Three.
Look.
Beaver.
You old mutt. Now I'm three down again.
What is it?
It didn't go that time.
Right. Ronnie, get it for me.
All clear, Ronnie.
Ready!
Take him, will you.
Alright, Bert?
- Aye-aye, sir.
Where are we?
We're inside the harbour now.
How do you feel?
Oh .. I say.
What is it? Your eyes hurting too?
No. No, they're alright.
Did Ronnie notice?
Notice what?
The JurgenStrasse.
That they had shifted her.
No. He didn't notice.
Shall I pass the word for stretcher bearers, sir?
No. Never mind.
Make fast, then go ashore.
- Aye-aye, sir.
We'll go to the base and see about your head.
It's alright.
Hardly notice it.
- It ought to be attended to.
Right.
Do it when we report.
Will you .. shake hands?
- Right.
Just one thing more.
Will you let me talk to
Ann for just a moment?
Why not?
Why not?
Thank you.
Thanks.
I say, Ronnie.
I can't see.
I thought so.
The fastest ..
Yet, Ronnie.
The harbour might be full of strange ships.
That have come in since we left.
I can't see them.
Beaver!
You mutt. You did it!
And I made you do it.
The JurgenStrasse isn't it.
Isn't it?
Uhuh.
- Ronnie.
I'm just two down now.
Ronnie.
He was here. He left this.
Coming back today, later.
He says here that he understands.
He will understand, won't he Ronnie?
Please say that he will.
Yes, Ann.
He came with us on the boat.
Dear Ronnie.
You always make everything right.
It is right. Isn't it, Ronnie?
I know now that it is.
And Claude will know too.
I can tell him now, can't I?
Not yet.
Wasn't wrong this morning.
Wrong now. Things have changed.
Claude.
Where is he?
- At the doctors.
What is it?
- Eyes.
Left him there. Came to you.
We'll know when we get back.
Knew you'd want to be there if he ..
Of course.
Come along.
I'll see.
Not finished yet.
Why did you bring him here?
He wanted to.
Said find out first.
Decide what to do later.
You wouldn't have brought him here.
If you hadn't been afraid.
Ronnie.
Have you ever ..
Really prayed?
Not until now.
Neither have I.
Sister. Mine.
Your friend, who is another soldier.
Report him to the base authorities.
He is blind.
No hope, ever?
I see.
Ronnie.
Let me.
Sure?
- Uhuh.
Hi, sailor.
Hi.
What do you mean, getting a girl out at this time of night?
Never do it again.
Played the devil this time, didn't you.
A mess, isn't it.
- You're in luck, sailor.
Not dead like Jimmy and Hobart at any rate.
You'll be out in a few months in that boat getting in trouble all over again.
Sailor is ashore for good, Ann.
Lot you know. Doctor knows better.
Funny.
Like this I can see Ann's face clearer than ever.
Is he well enough to come along home with Ann?
Right.
Come along.
Back in a minute, sailor.
Can't talk in there.
Ann.
I only came to apologise.
To ask your pardon for anything that I've said .. or thought.
Today I went out with them .. and now I know why it's all happened.
You wanted me to know, didn't you.
I only wanted to see your face different from what it was that night.
It is different.
Isn't it.
I was trying to hurt you, and them.
I can't hurt them.
Him.
He's a better man at 20 than I am at 27.
He'll be a better man at 27 than I've been.
He loves you, doesn't he.
He always has.
I know.
- No, you don't.
You don't know, Richard.
I told you once, I loved you.
I still do.
No, don't.
Don't touch me.
A few hours ago when you came back.
I thought we could be alive.
To have each other.
It's back, just where it was.
Claude's in there.
His eyes.
He's blind.
What?
Now do you understand?
Blind.
Mack says I'd take a lot of killing.
He should have said it for both of us, shouldn't he.
Back.
Get in any more mischief while I was away?
A bit of thinking, that's all.
That's mischief.
Cigarette?
- No thanks.
Drink?
Ann.
Yes?
Come here.
Not all rain, is it.
Don't for me, Ann.
I'll be alright.
Everything will.
Of course.
You might tell me about that wild ride of yours.
Not much to tell.
The torpedo stuck again.
Shell hit me before second try.
Bogard pulled the lever.
I guess he got more than he bargained for.
A good chap, Ann.
I like him.
Like him a lot.
I like him .. too.
There is the Möhne, surrounded by batteries.
There, there.
There, there.
Anti-aircraft chiefly from the north and the east.
The cruiser lies about here.
A bit more to the north, sir.
That's a dummy there.
- The best approach is from the south.
Now you realize Captain, that cruiser has got to be removed.
Before we can land a single man on the Möhne.
It must be removed at any cost.
Uhuh.
Can you do it?
Yes, sir.
Unless I'm hit directly by accident.
I can get enough height to dive in and drop the bombs before they can stop me.
And then what?
And then what, sir?
Well, it was my suggestion that this thing be done by lots.
But Major Moseley said that you volunteered for it.
Yes, sir.
Very well. That's all.
Good luck.
- Thank you, sir.
I may say there will be a ribbon in it when you ..
If you ..
- We'll appreciate that, sir.
I say.
Wish you luck. May I?
- Thanks.
I'm sorry to hear about ..
I know .. war seems to have a way of doing in good chaps.
I hope you'll get back.
Thanks again.
Ronnie.
- Yes?
Where is Ann?
- In there.
I say Ronnie, don't.
She's sleeping.
Sit down will you. I want to chin a bit.
Smoke?
- Yes, thanks.
Thanks.
About Ann, Ronnie.
She loves him.
How did you ..?
- Sure of it now.
I thought so though, this afternoon.
When he shook hands.
I didn't think you noticed.
- Uhuh.
Noticed.
See better now.
See lots of things.
Just came from the Admiral's.
A silly mess.
What is it?
- You know. Cruiser to be sunk.
Is it on?
- Yes. He's got it.
What?
- Yes. Volunteered to fly in.
Leaves tonight. Be there at dawn.
I say Ronnie, he won't come back. I know. I've flown myself.
That's what Wing Commander said: "Not get back".
But I ..
Ronnie.
Does he know about me?
No.
No lying, now.
Does he?
Yes.
Look, Ronnie.
I'm blind.
Finished.
When this is over I'll be a chap tapping about with a stick.
In everybody's way.
England hard hit too.
Will be when this is over.
America, though.
It's far away.
Seems out of it.
She'd forget.
Children .. and such.
You know what I mean, Ronnie?
- Yes.
Listen, Ronnie.
We know the harbour.
We know the cruiser too.
We could be in and out before they know we're there.
Yes. Thought of that.
Did you, Ronnie?
You would.
You know what I mean then?
- Yes.
I know another thing too.
- What?
You and Ann.
No.
No, Ronnie.
Not love.
Just habit.
War, maybe.
Remember how we talked as children?
Well.
We're not children anymore.
We're grown-ups.
Look.         - What?
- Look at me.
Now say it.
Say what, Ronnie?
- Say it isn't love.
No, it isn't love, Ronnie.
- You're lying.       - No, really.
You're lying.
Ronnie.
What else, Ronnie?
Cheero.
Wait Ronnie. Wait.
I'm going too. What do you think?
- No.
Yes Ronnie. You don't need to see to pull a lever.      - No.
Yes, Ronnie.
Right.
I say Ronnie, can we look in?
Daresn't old chap.
Might wake her, see.
Just a look? Just a moment?
Quiet now.
I promise I shan't move without you.
Are you looking at her, Ronnie?
Look at her while I'm touching you.
Is it now?
- Yes.
Now.
Alright, sir.
- Thank you, Sergeant.
[ Singing: ]
"And a bearing is close to my brain."
"Take the cylinders out of my lungs, boys."
"And assemble the engine .."
Hello teacher. Hello. Come on.
Have a drink. Come on.
No thanks, Mack.
- Come on.
You'd better start drinking water.
Water? Water. Have you forgotten the Johnstown floods?
The poor women, the children.
- Pull yourself together, Mack.
Don't worry about me.
I wouldn't miss it for worlds.
I never been shot at by a battleship.
Something to tell the Sunday
School class back in Podunk.
Clock eh? Beaver what?
And a couple of loons, that's us.
And while I think of it, you know ..
Who took my drink? Give me a drink, Jackson. Give me a drink.
Bring him some coffee, Jackson.
And make him drink it.
Coffee?
Coffee. Do you hear what he said?
Well I guess you'd better do it.
What is it, Bert?
Mr Boyce-Smith and Mr Hope, Miss.
They've gone out on the boat.
They made me and Reece stay ashore and they went off alone.
Why, Mr Hope. He's ..
- Yes, Miss. He could hardly walk.
He was always a fair one for his bottle, but this time ..
But he wasn't drinking. He's blind.
Blind, Miss?
- Where did they go?
I don't know, Miss.
The trip wasn't scheduled.
They gave me this to take to Captain
Bogard, but I thought I'd come to you.
Where may I telephone?
Down the street, Miss. Round the corner.
- Wait a minute.
Ready, Mack?
No, but I guess I'll go.
I'm drawing their money. I ought to do a little something for them.
[ Telephone ]
Hello. Who?
Oh, Captain. Telephone for you.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello. Hello Richard.
It's Ann.
Yes, Ann?
Ronnie and Claude went out on the boat.
Didn't take the men with them.
They left a note for you.
Bert brought it to me.
Open it and read it.
Mack, get everything ready.
Hurry!
Richard.
It says.
It says .. "Take care of Ann".
"Happy landings."
What does it mean, Richard?
It means they're doing a job I ought to be doing. Goodbye, Ann.
God bless you .. goodbye.
[ Whispering ]
Getting close now. Ready?
I smell smoke.
Beaver, Ronnie. Beaver!
Right.
- Ronnie.
Now I'm just one down.
Right you are.
Smoke again.
Beaver, Ronnie.
Right.
Ronnie. We're even now.
I've caught you at last.
We're even now, Ronnie.
- Right.
Ready?
Now!
It didn't go, Ronnie.
The crank. Where is it?
I'll fit the crank.
You hook the cables in.
Try it now, Ronnie.
Got it yet?
Not yet.
No go.
Jammed. Can't get it back.
If I could only see.
What now, Ronnie?
Come up here.
Get out the boat.
Get out?
- They'll pick you up.
Take ä lifebelt. Go overside.
No. You take it.
You can't see.
You can poînt the boat and jump.
I can hold her straight.
- No.
Get off I tell you.
- No.
I rank you. I say: go overside!
No, Ronnie.
Your last chance. You won't?
- Absolutely not.
I'll bet I get there first.
Is it now?
Yes, now!
T-G oö
LADY KILLER
Well then, will you open the door?
Well, this isn't bad.
It was deliberate that you locked up, right?
You paint your nails all red, you go to the hairdresser's place.
This is my own doing, go ahead.
Don't shake, you'll shake the burgundy.
You've been sitting around in your slippers for eight days.
But then he returns from maneuvers and again, perfume is in the air.
The toilet and maintenance are professional obligations.
I asked you to cut the sausage!
That, that's a professional obligation.
- Your place is at the cash register.
- No but, would you be jealous?
And if I were?
One blow of the trumpet and you can't hold your place.
Listen, they'll march, and go on, amuse yourself by filling up the sidewalk, and you'll see.
- Where is he? I don't see him. - That's the one, the second to the right, that's the Lady Killer.
Thanks to this little masterpiece, he arrived during maneuvers.
Yes, a widow at that, with whom I dined.
It's very bad.
"My commander, I believe it's my duty to inform you that over six months,
"I've changed nine times.
"I had a handsome man who'd take them young or a little unripe,
"a certain Lady Killer, who serves in your regiment, who terrifies everyone.
"This is in the hope that you'll want to intervene, etc..."
And it's signed Madame Widow Duchamps, founder of the soldier's recreation.
Yes, I already received several of the same kind.
- Did you throw them in the garbage?
- I hear that.
Bourrache is an exemplary, intelligent, punctual, sober officer.
He pleases women, why, how, that...
He's the Lady Killer, everyone calls him that.
My commander, the marshall of the lodges
Bourrache, he's here.
Have him come in!
Anyway, I must alarm him.
Advance.
Bourrache, I commend you on your engagement at Fort Morar.
- Yes, my commander.
- Do you intend to re-enlist?
No, my commander.
Then... would it be too much to ask for you to leave the fairer sex alone for a bit?
Someone's writing me, someone's complaining.
Can't you at least leave the women of Madame Duchamps alone?
- Ha, is she the one who complained?
- Notably.
Ha, well this is too much.
You know, my commander, that
Madame Duchamps founded...
- the soldier's recreation and library?
- Yes.
My faith, that pleased me a lot,
I love to read.
Something you don't know is that the books aren't all at the library, some are with Madame Duchamps. Those that I was looking for, principally.
So you went there often...
Well yes, because I'd begun to read the complete works of Dumas.
Then I saw Madame Duchamps... me
I'm the one who sees nothing.
Only they, the women, they saw me.
Then she kicked them out.
And then one day Madame Duchamps played the big game.
Commander, I was in Africa and I was working hard.
And well, for the first time in my life,
I was afraid, my commander.
Ah yes, afraid in front of the widow Duchamps.
Nevertheless, I didn't write you to complain.
Say then, you don't tire yourself too much?
Ah, it's a good bed, my friend.
Especially when one is alone.
That, that's a big caliber!
- Take them, they're on the table.
- Ah, a little gift?
Yes.
I found that there, with other things and then piles of letters.
Yes, there are some, are they funny?
Oh, it's been a while since that's made me laugh, I didn't even smile.
- Pity on you! - Do you want a little sock in the teeth?
Don't refuse that, my friend.
What can they be talking about inside?
Oh surely the same old stories.
They're alone, they're bored.
Me, I'm with them when I'm bored.
Ha, all that, that can't be worth a good friend, believe me.
Say then, can I open this?
The little bird? Yes, if you want, she didn't send a gift.
- Yes, and well the bird sends you
100 bullets. - No kidding?
And well, then again, it'll cost me
10 rounds to send it back.
Here, the honor is yours.
Thank you.
Is it possible?
You need to keep that for polishing the buttons. It's copper water.
Good, go, I understand.
Come on, my little father, we'll go have lobster with Father Cailloux.
With Father Cailloux? But if you see his wife...?
His wife, it's all the same to me, it's the lobster that interests me.
I'll warn you right now, by the way, I'm not there.
Oh but me neither, but don't worry, we'll manage.
- Let's go, we'll see after. - Yeah, enough deprivation.
As you were saying, sir.
Father Cailloux's lobster, you know...
Hey, do you realize?
Glory!
They got 200 from him like that.
It's sold in the whole department.
- Can we get it at least? - Well no, the rights of the author and all that.
And it's the father's touch that revived me for a series on horse and in color.
That'll end with you turning your head.
You're crazy.
- Did you see? - You could've let me believe she was for me!
- Hello gentlemen.
- Good evening, Madame.
- Hold on, here's the Lady Killer.
- Good evening, good evening.
Good evening, gentlemen.
- Here?
- Yes.
- For these two gentlemen, two places?
- Ah no, thank you, we're not eating.
Ingrate, couldn't you tell me one kind word?
Two quarts Vichy.
- Eight days without a word from you.
- I'm arrived, I'm here, what.
- To taunt me?
- But no, for much simpler reasons.
Your husband, your husband...
Félix, put the Pouilly on ice and the Chateau-Neuf in the room.
I smell the lobster.
- Mmm, that smells good.
- Oh yes.
You'll have to tell me about the new ones over there.
- Over there?
- Go, attack.
Say, in your opinion, eating lobster at this temperature, it's not dangerous?
Ah, I won't risk it myself.
And well, you see, it's always the civil ones who are most courageous.
Yes.
What are they saying?
Oh, the jokes of officers, don't pay attention.
He thinks it's funny.
Does he think the lobster is funny?
I cut it alive, Monsieur!
And burn it until it dies.
Does he think it's funny?
You remember, the last time when it was scratched.
Oh, say, gentlemen!
You come here to take two quarts
Vichy and you allow yourselves...
What, someone has more of a right to evoke memories now?
Ah yes, but to claim this lobster isn't good, anyway...
- It smells like corn starch.
- It smells like...?
You say it smells like starch, a sauce linked to the cream, Monsieur.
Hold that for me, put your nose there.
- And then, do you have a stuffy nose?
- The odor isn't bad, but the taste?
Well then, I won't allow someone to doubt my cuisine.
You'll taste it for me. Félix!
- But no, I'm not hungry.
- Just a piece. Félix!
- But no, I'm not hungry.
- Just a piece.
Félix! Two places.
But no, stop yelling, it's really no trouble.
A bottle of Pouilly and two glasses!
This one then, it's strong.
I'm taking everyone to witness!
And if these gentlemen are honest, they'll recognize their error.
This is really to please you, you know.
- Nothing of the best pieces here...
- Ah my lobster, is it bad?
I'll slap you until your stomach hurts.
My lobster, is it bad?
This one is strong.
Then? Are you making marshal
Bourrache come?
Here, my commander.
Bourrache, I received another complaint about you.
Another?
You know how in the small towns, people don't know what to do, then...
Yes, but this time, it's not a woman.
It's a notary.
A notary?
When your aunt died, you asked me 2 days to attend her funeral? In Cannes?
Well, I had to do that for her, my commander.
You had to for her.
And you took advantage of these two days to go where?
Well my commander, I don't like burials, whether I followed the convoy or not, that wouldn't have changed anything.
So I took advantage of the two days to go back to Lyon.
Your aunt's notary wanted to see you.
She left small debts, surely, but that...
She left you 10,000 francs.
And he wrote me to ask if you were dead too.
He must be reassured, my commander, he must be reassured right away.
- Marnouillet, is it very close to
Cannes? - Yes, yes.
- In a day, you can go down and come back up? - Yes, yes.
- Good, I'm granting you 24 hours.
- Thank you, my commander.
You can break. Yes, but... not for Lyon, eh!
For Cannes.
"Night Telegraph"
Monsieur... Monsieur!
- I'd like to send an urgent telegram.
- There are templates on the desks.
This is to ask for money, I left the casino, I don't have a penny anymore.
Is depositing my watch a guarantee?
No, no, that's prohibited.
But there's a jewelry store straight out that's open all night long.
- They can do that for you.
- Thank you.
"URGENT FORTY THOUSAND"
"FIFTY"
If I were in your place,
I would have put sixty.
10,000 more or less, what difference does it make...
It's a good idea, thank you.
Ah, for other people's telegrams, one always finds the text easily.
Me, I had big difficulties with mine.
Anyway, you don't want me to write yours, do you?
Bah, that would suit me very well, only I don't know... if you know how to warn your commander that you missed a train.
"Sorry I missed my train."
But he'd think I was making fun of him.
- "Delighted to have missed my train."
- Well, he'd take that rather badly.
"Missed my train, taking the next one."
Well yeah, but you see, the next one leaves in an hour.
And so?
And so, I'm under the impression that
I'll miss it as well.
- Because of what?
- Because of you...
Yes, I'm sure you'll want to get some fresh air... and afterwards get a refreshment, isn't that right?
What will the commander say?
Oh, the commander would say in a case like that,
I won't be able to repeat it to a woman like you.
- Will you be punished?
- At least I'll know why.
Come on.
If you may, let's dispatch that, eh?
Does this amuse you?
Telegram please.
The name, is this Jean-Pierre Moreaux or Moreux?
- Is it Moreaux or Moreux?
- Moreaux.
Moreaux.
- You've played, eh?
- An hour, to distract myself.
- Are you bored here?
- Does that surprise you?
There's the sea, the boats, the people passing by.
I'm bored everywhere.
Maybe that's because you are too beautiful... and that you too easily obtain what you want.
It's not stupid, what you're saying.
But anyway, there are still people who wear the uniform and have common sense.
Take the example, earlier, of the telegraph,
- it's luck that I saw your hands first.
- You're not friendly.
No, sorry, you must understand me.
Earlier, if I'd seen your eyes first,
I wouldn't have dared speak to you.
- Nevertheless, you don't seem shy.
- That depends who I'm with.
- In fact, you didn't even introduce yourself, Monsieur. - Yes, that's true.
Well, my name is Lucien.
Not very pretty, eh?
But on intimate terms, I have another name.
Will you tell me?
This is the first time that I've found it stupid in front of a woman.
I'll keep it to myself.
- Lady KIller. It's stupid, huh?
- Why?
And you, what's your name?
- My name is Madeleine.
- Madeleine. That's nice, Madeleine.
Do you know all the women look at you?
Oh well, an officer, that's something to see.
Besides, between us, these men return it well.
- Have you finished looking at that officer? - What officer?
If you think I don't see your game, go away!
He's in red and white, but I was in blue in the trenches, that's the difference.
You'd be wrong to think he's the only one.
Oh, but you still provoke a little irritation.
I didn't know that hair could smell so good.
Do you come often to Cannes?
No, this is the first time, I came to collect a small inheritance.
Like everyone, but do you know what to do with it?
Oh, you know me, money, for me it's the same, I can pass over some very well.
You're lucky.
Ah, if it were a big sum, that'd be different, but 10,000 francs...
But there are people who've won a fortune playing 10,000 francs.
But there are also people who've lost
10,000 francs before winning a fortune.
- Listen...
- What?
To meet a woman one evening without knowing anything about her, and telling her: "my money, here it is, play it,"
Wouldn't you find that funny?
Not at all, not at all.
Is he perhaps an adventurer?
- No.
- The telegraph incident, a conspiracy?
- No. - The vamps of the casino, there are plenty you know...
Not you.
There are some so cunning that they warn their victims of what awaits.
Ah yes?
- Hold on, take the money.
- Don't have so much trust!
- Go play.
- Never in my life, let's see.
Today is not a day like the others, and in these times one must do things unlike the others.
I only wanted to see if you had confidence, that's what amused me.
And if I ask you for it now?
Winning or losing, to me it's the same.
You know what interests me?
It's to be here, myself, in this room, and to have a heart beating strong.
Very strong.
Not for the money.
For the idea awaiting you.
- And if I didn't come back?
- This is a game that amuses me.
Go take everything, and the pin with it.
Go.
I'm sure you'll win.
"The party has started"
Monsieur, a ticket for you.
- For me?
- Yes, from the blonde lady with the...
Ah yes. Well, for tonight you can tell her... "complete."
- Good, Monsieur.
- There it is.
- You aren't asking me anything?
- Oh, I already understand.
I'm so annoyed with all these jokes.
- Are you sure that I played them at least? - Ah alas!
I was too confiding then at one fell swoop.
But me too, they had me come at one fell swoop.
Bills are left for me in balance.
- Are you upset?
- Me? But since I know you...
- Do you want to dance?
- No, that made me nervous.
Would it not bother you to accompany me home?
Sincerely not.
- You don't have a car? - Yes, it was waiting for me by the telegraph.
- Why did you send it back? - I didn't want the driver to know where I went.
Or with whom.
Ah but wait a sec, what you said there, was that nice or mean?
I didn't know yet how the evening would end.
And do you know now?
Vaguely.
Tell the driver to enter the garden, would you like to?
Here, keep the change of a man who lost
10,000 francs without knowing to what,
- that doesn't come along every day.
- Even to someone who'd have won them.
Oh shit.
- Hey, Lucien!
- Yeah.
I say, really, I find it dumb you return to Paris so soon after being liberated.
Well I did a two-year apprenticeship, there's no lack of printing presses.
The printing presses maybe, but the work?
I got along well here then; in
Paris, I'll do it even better, no?
Why don't you tell the truth?
A kid who'd never seen a woman,
I'd understand, but you...
Maybe it's because I know what I like.
And the way in which she's rotten isn't enough for you?
Well you see, René, first I thought like you.
And forces stirred that, I was given a maybe, something I hadn't understood.
It's clear that if she was interested she'd respond to your letters.
- Maybe she didn't receive them - Then they'd be sent back to you.
- Maybe they weren't given to her.
- And then what?
No, me, I think you're a little upset.
What you call being upset, being a kid, was it the first joy of loving a woman?
Finally, I'm telling you you'll live in the country, I'll help you, etc... and to that you respond, "no, I want to go back to Paris,
"to rediscover a woman who had the kindness to steal 10,000 francs from me,
"and to whom I cling over all." And you aren't the last of the idiots?
- Yes.
- Well then?
I find that it feels nice in the grass.
- Hello Monsieur, Mademoiselle Madeleine
Courtois, please. - She lives here.
- I'd like to see her.
- Madame is absent.
- For a long time?
- Madame is in Italy for six months.
And this is on the part of whom?
Of... I brought a letter, by the way...
There's no stamp, excuse me.
I'll be surprised if Madame does not approve of the transmission.
Goodbye Monsieur.
Hello Monsieur, could I have a room please?
We only rent by the week.
Or a month, it's the same to me provided it be well-kept and not too dear.
- It's 140 francs a week.
- Good.
Here's the price. And no food in the house, eh!
Ah but I eat at the restaurant, what do you think?
Maybe you haven't realized, I'm civil since yesterday, I was a Spahi officer.
To the neighborhood, when someone knows Lady Killer is at your place, that will give you some funny publicity,
I'm telling you.
Who is that, Lady Killer?
It's me!
- No kidding.
- Yes.
Come on, I have no time to spare, there's a price to pay.
Good, good, understood...
I beg your pardon, finding work, for a typographer, is it difficult?
Oh, well here it's like anywhere. I warn you, the room is paid for in advance.
- Yes, that...
- You'll have to make me a little card.
Hold on, Rose, show the Monsieur to Room 18.
- Are the programs ready? - They're the last, boss, that will be finished.
- Don't rush the machine.
- Oh, don't be scared, I know it well.
- You're happy with the work, yes?
- I'll see.
I'll tell you right away.
- Well, this isn't bad.
- Here's the last one.
Good, we'll go take the programs, there are two free places. Jules?
Me, I can't, my wife is sick.
- Alfred? - I'm dining with my brother-in-law tonight.
Good, well then Bourrache.
Oh, well I'd like to go, boss, is the film good?
It appears that for the genre, it's the best of its kind.
Good, well I'll go then.
Albert will telephone you tomorrow morning with the orders.
- Good, Madame.
- Good evening.
Madeleine...
Ha, it's you.
You hadn't recognized me earlier.
Yes, yes.
Ah, I understand, you've come looking for your 10,000 francs.
My 10,000 francs?
I know what it's like to need money.
This time is a little... unique.
But...
I can give you a check.
Come in.
Follow me.
Come in, come in.
Why not mention that earlier?
Ah, it's true to say you owe me nothing at all.
Pardon. I did something stupid to you,
I'm just trying to fix it.
It's as much to me as if it didn't cost me anything at all.
- Shall I make it out to the carrier?
- Yes.
- You're not lucky.
- Not very.
Let's hope they make a bigger success of you.
Here, take this.
Why did you never respond to me?
I never write.
Why don't you talk to me anymore like at Cannes?
You're not the same.
If you don't respond to letters, do you read them at least?
- I read them.
- Like that, vaguely...
Anyway I told you why I came here, why I left everything behind.
It was an obsession despite your silence, I had to find you.
And you believe this is for money?
But I assure you that I find all that naturally.
Eight months I waited for you, and in plain view of jokers, I swear to you.
Because what I had known before hadn't prepared me for you.
Men or women, I did what I wanted with my uniform and good mouth.
But the day I met you, it was no more, finished...
A man like the others who pays when he's thirsty.
- You were better off in Paris than
Orange. - I thought only of you.
Eight months, I thought only of you.
Oh, evidently, that seemed strange to me, I've found a little explanation.
Then I'll see you again.
- You'll give me that.
- Since you ask it of me.
Me?
I don't care about your check.
Then there was nothing between us, there never was?
Our time in Cannes, that's a joke?
The return by car, that's a joke?
My head was filled with nonsense, eh?
Well if you want, for you it was nothing, there was nothing.
But me, something happened to me, something burst inside me, you hear?
You don't know what it is to wait... to wait.
Why do you want to take what I wanted to give you?
Then earlier, I didn't recognize you?
I didn't make a deliberate effort to return alone?
I didn't know that you were in front of my door?
Then, why the check?
Me too, I played the game.
Like you in Cannes, to be sure.
What pleased me over there wasn't the costume, it was your eyes.
They stayed the same.
But in Cannes, why did you close the door on my nose?
You didn't have to take me to my place.
It's funny,
I never foresee the words that you'll say or the gestures you'll make.
Even this one?
Ah yes...
Do you have everything you need?
You see.
Oh, but I forgot, do you perhaps eat eggs in the morning?
No, my dear, those from the hotel were never fresh, so I renounced them.
You!
Let's get you going, the bath will get cold.
- You look like a monkey like that.
- That must change me.
- Let's go, get ready.
- Yes.
This is quite a bathroom!
On the electric dryer you'll find hot towels.
And cologne is on the table beside the lavender water, with sponges, a brush...
And everything, everything.
- Is Lady Killer happy?
- No, don't call me that! Only Lucien.
But Lucien, that's common.
Lady Killer, there's only one.
Hello? Yes, it's me. Hello.
No, you think. It's nice.
That would astonish me if you hadn't told me.
No, I was very tired.
Then I slept nine hours and then
I was well rested.
Tonight? I have no plans, yes.
We can have dinner.
Then alright, 8:00. Goodbye.
Little killer, do you know it's already
And your printing press is at the other end of Paris.
Did you lose your words?
Did you drown?
Madeleine, it's... a joke?
- What's going on?
- Your date tonight...
- But these are friends.
- No, no, no.
Well, and me then?
You think that now I'll be able to stay alone?
It's with me that you're dining tonight.
But this is the first time you've said anything about it.
Naturally, if I can, I'll get ready.
I'll introduce you to La Grille, you'll see, it's a great little cafe.
It's not chic, but anything you can order there is good.
I can see the head chef when I arrive:
"your cutlery, Lucien?"
Then I'll say: "two, I'm waiting for someone."
I can't wait to see his face when he sees who I'm waiting for.
Would you refuse me that?
No.
Then to be sure, tell me now: "my friends, to the train station, I swear."
I swear.
Then, Monsieur Bourrache,
- the duck, should I still keep it out?
- Yes, yes.
Well she's not in a hurry, your buddy there.
You'd told me 7:30.
Ah, but your clock is late.
She's 15 minutes late.
Hello, is Madame awake, please?
It's from Lucien Bourrache.
Is it you, Madeleine?
Well, why didn't you come, when you had promised me?
- Huh?
- Forgive me, I'm still not awake yet.
Ah yes, I told you at the last minute
I couldn't free myself.
But no, you're stupid Lucien.
But doesn't it tire you to get up so early?
Then listen, I'll wait for you tonight at the same place.
Why not tonight?
Ah good... Good, since you can't do otherwise.
Tomorrow is my day of rest. I'll wait for you at the Chaumont hills at 3:00.
At the entry, you know, the bottom one.
It's that.
You stand me up but you're kind, regardless.
You know what I think...
I'll kiss you.
You see I often came to sit down here for the night.
This is the prettier place, but it's very bright.
- Then I was always alone.
- I find that so funny.
- Always alone.
- Oh yeah.
To return to my memories, again and again.
Then you see I did like everyone,
I engraved a name.
- Madeleine? - Ah no, lovers who wrote names always laughed at others doing it.
No, I took an anonymous word that means nothing to me.
And well, Cannes?
So it lasts a long time, I took a word that exists longer in French.
Show me.
Un-con-sti-tu-tion-al-ly.
What does that mean?
It means I love you.
It doesn't seem to please you, my garden.
Maybe the gardener pleases me too much.
- You don't understand one without the other. - You always want to understand.
You know me, I do inexplicable things.
All simply, like that, because they go through my head.
Ah, good, good.
What do you want now, to walk, sit down, drink something?
I want to go to your place.
Go on, go on, bring friends; Marcel is waiting for us at the belote game.
- Me, I can't tonight.
- It suited you for revenge.
- I'm telling you I can't.
- Ah, it's nothing, it doesn't matter.
You're funny, it's not everything in life, the belote.
Evidently, but to always have to cancel on friends, you'll regret it one day.
Go on, maybe.
- Go on, until tomorrow, goodbye guys.
- Goodbye Lucien.
Goodbye, deserter.
What's this?
Oh, René!
Then, old buffalo,
- how's it going?
- Well, old friend.
You have a funny look on your face.
You scared me, I thought it was a telegram calling me off, I'm eating.
Ah, Monsieur dines in the city. And you're all made up, I see. A lady?
- Yes, a lady. - You don't say much of that in your letters.
It's hard to explain to you. But say, I thought you had a banquet tonight?
No thank you, ten hours of congress, they'll go on without me.
Then by chance, I had come.
Then we'll dine together...
Well, yes but...
According to what I understood, the lady, she stood you up...
Then this is an occasion for you to get back at her.
- I can't.
- Even for me?
The one time I'm in Paris?
Well, you understand, if...
Well, yes, I understand... that changes and that doesn't change.
- You're dumb, we'll see. If you'll let me, I'll clean up a bit. - But go ahead.
Hey, a silk shirt! Is that going to work?
Yes, always. And you, are you leaving?
Do you have epidemics over there?
Well, alright. It's going even better than I would have believed.
The black point, this is village boredom. Never anything, no adventure.
Oh, well maybe it's worth more than that.
Well, speak for yourself!
It's because you see me on a beautiful day, but there are others my friend...
It's nothing: while coming back from the congress to here,
I saw at least three women whom
I've fallen in love with.
You can return to your congress, I asurre you, and then return to Lyon.
Ah, by the way,Madame Cailloux says hello.
- And the photographer too.
- Ah yes?
- Is it you who knocked?
- No, it's not me.
- If you're pulling my leg, then...
- No, I assure you. Hold on!
Monsieur Bourrache, a telegram for you.
Thank you.
Ah ah, I believe we can dine together, eh?
She is obligated to leave for three days.
She's coming back on Tuesday.
We can.
You're wrong to show how much that pleases you.
- Tuesday... - Well what, Tuesday, that's not so far off.
Hello? Yes?
The printing press, Michel,
I'm listening.
Yes, sorry, sorry, one second.
I can't hear anything, stop it.
The inter is asking for me.
Hello? Hello, I'm listening.
A call from Deauville?
Who, Bourrache?
He's working all day long.
I already told you, Bourrache, my phone is not reserved for your love affairs.
- Deauville, you're sure it's Deauville?
- Deauville or not, you've been warned.
Deauville... well then.
Maybe you should remember that it's me who puts the machine on the market.
- No, no.
- Good, we'll he's happy.
- Is Madame there?
- We don't expect her.
- She wrote me to come dine Tuesday.
- I'd be surprised if she expects you.
Madame telephoned to call off the dinner.
Telephoned from where?
Well, Mme. isn't there but then why this appearance, is it to return the coal?
And that, the set table, is this for that?
I don't have any explanations to give Monsieur.
Well, I'll wait for Madame in the parlor until she returns.
I am not authorized to leave Monsieur alone in the apartment.
What, you'll afraid I'll take the clock or the piano, no?
I didn't receive orders, Monsieur.
You'll keep me company.
Watch over me.
You can sit down.
I must stay here, I don't have the right to sit down.
It's beautiful to have nuanced direction like that, I admire you Adrien.
- I even admire you a lot.
- Should I thank the Monsieur?
- Adrien, confidentially?
- Monsieur?
Have you ever taken a good slap on the mouth?
The case never presented itself,
Monsieur.
Someone rang.
Thank you.
- Hello Adrien.
- Hello Madame.
- Is my daughter there? - Madame is in Deauville, she'll be back late, she called and asked Madame if she wanted to dine.
- But, the envelope?
- Ah, tomorrow only.
But if it's urgent, it'd be my pleasure to oblige Madame.
You're a darling Adrien. Is the menu taken care of?
Some trifles. A quail with grapes and chocolate mousse.
A quail with grapes...
I must inform Madame that in the parlor there is a...
"Monsieur," who refuses to leave.
- But... what is he like?
- Not very well.
What kind of "not very well"?
The impossible kind, Madame.
We've never had that.
And this Monsieur dares show himself just before I'm going to bed?
I'll deal with him myself.
Well done, eh, the mousse.
- Yes, a sturdy kind.
- Pardon?
My friend, you please my daughter, good, do it. Let's be frank.
The women of today are crazy.
But my duty as a mother is to limit harm done.
- What are you concerned about?
- Simply, my daughter's happiness.
- Hold on then. - My friend, I understand very well that a pretty girl, a good table, and satin armchairs have attraction for you.
But please, indulge in them with a little more discretion.
And outside of working hours.
- If Madeleine heard you...
- She would approve.
It's her delicacy that prevents her from saying all that.
This furniture, these rugs, these ornaments...
All that isn't found under a horse's foot.
Madeleine has needs.
I'm in charge of her.
Don't be careless in considering what you can do for her.
And you, the harm you can do to me.
Oh let's see, because I call a cat a cat?
Madeleine's protector has a wide spirit, this is understood.
But he's an elevated man and who wouldn't prefer him over all else?
My friend, look at yourself in a mirror.
If you were a man, what I'd do to you...
My God, you're susceptible.
A big boy like you!
Hold on, I call upon your good feelings.
Don't sit around like that in parlors where you don't have anything to do.
And when Madeleine is gone, take the opportunity to try to forget.
She just called from Deauville to say she hasn't returned.
What do you hope?
It was fine, Deauville.
Call her tomorrow and be reasonable.
Life is life, my friend.
Everyone needs happiness.
Only egotists decline to share.
Adrien, accompany Monsieur.
Ah, it's not you who's hunting me, go.
- Nor you, nor him. - Go, go, a little fresh air will do you very well!
Go, my friend.
Adrien, I'm going to the table.
I'm starving!
- Are you there? - But I've been waiting for you for an hour.
I've wanted to warn you about the workshop. A nice muzzle, your boss.
I'd thought the surprise would please you and you don't seem happy.
Oh, you're stupid. No, only, I was at your place as suited me.
And I met your mother.
- Ah. - And I took a long walk before coming back.
- Did you talk to mom?
- Why?
- Oh, nothing, just to know.
- Two words, like that.
But what's going on?
You don't even kiss me.
Yes.
Funny, I was so depressed for a minute, and as soon as you're there, it's over.
Earlier, during my reverie, I thought about something that'd be amazing.
I'll have my 15 days of vacation, we'll leave all of them, would you like to?
- You're kind.
- To Pont-de-l'Arche.
Surely you don't know Pont-de-l'Arche?
You'll see, it's not only the place, the Seine, but...
You and me, the evenings.
Without thinking the whole time,
"in an hour I'll be alone again."
Listen, if it were possible I'd say yes right away.
But my dear, tomorrow is the first of August.
- And so?
- But you're like a child.
He asks for a star, give me a star.
And I don't know how to make you understand it's not possible,
- and that I'm not being mean.
- Is it really the same?
I must go back to Deauville.
I'll come back several times, naturally.
- Then I'll say that mom is sick.
- Yes?
It will be better to have waited for me.
To have waited for you.
Notice, I don't ask you to tell any lies.
A girl doesn't lie to her mother.
God these pigeons are tender!
But I was your age once.
And you must know that today
I'm penniless, it's not because of the Russian loans, no.
But because of a stupidity like that one.
These little peas are delicious.
Try to understand I can do everything just as well with people if necessary.
I leave tomorrow for Deauville.
All the same!
Conserve a little, Jean-Pierre.
The magnificent radio telegram that he sent me!
I have scruples about pulling his leg.
He's an idiot but that bothers me.
Are you waiting for someone?
- Is Madame there?
- Monsieur is expected?
Do you want to warn Madame?
I'll be surprised if Madame who is dining with Madame's mother...
Listen Adrien, if at 3 you haven't done what I've told you... 1... 2...
The Monsieur wants to take the trouble of entering.
And wiping his feet.
Ah you, if you continue to exasperate me...
- It's you? - Madeleine.
- You could have warned me.
I let myself point it out to Monsieur, but he forced open the door.
Ah listen before all, that one, throw him outside, slam the door behind him.
- Let's see Lucien. - His air, his tone,
I can't take him anymore.
But you didn't understand what he said.
Kick him out or it's me who leaves.
Adrien, return to the office,
I'll see you all later.
- Ah.
- If Madame wants...
- Do what the Monsieur tells you.
- Go, get along! That's enough.
- But listen, you're being dramatic for nothing. - Finally, what...
Don't come in, mom is here.
So what?
Mom, I believe you know
Monsieur Bourrache.
I've had the pleasure.
Adrien isn't bringing the dessert?
- I've just put him out the door.
- I heard.
Such a good domestic.
If I've understood correctly, we're deprived of nuns?
- No nuns.
- What?
- No nuns.
- On a whim of Monsieur.
Exactly.
If I invite your mother again, I hope you reserve a better welcome for her.
But no one's keeping you.
Monsier, would you also perhaps like to make me give my eight days?
Ah, but I swear to you that they wouldn't be stolen.
- How you permit this... - Listen, tell her to leave, I can't see her anymore.
- That's insane. - Your speeches, your counsels, experience, I know it all.
- Get out, no cake tonight, get out.
- Madeleine, let's see...
Let's see, you see that you're irritating Lucien.
- And you're driving me out? - But no, you should come back, it's that simple.
And well, my little girl, you'll never see your mother again.
Lout!
Be quiet, go. At the end of the month she'll come looking for her envelope.
Dirty individual.
- Adrien, did you hear?
- What Madame?
- I know you, you listen to the doors.
- Then I heard.
That can't last, that can't last.
That maniac will ruin us.
- Yes Madame.
- And who can stop him, who?
- If I knew him...
- What's the number of Monsieur Moreaux?
- That's not a stupid idea...
- What?
No, I'd like to say that Madame has an idea there. No: Passy 32 21.
An idea that is a credit to the
Madame's ingenuity, although it must be carried out with an elegant procedure.
It is not a matter of elegance, but of effectiveness.
Hello. Hello.
Monsieur Moreaux? Madeleine's mother here.
Very well, very well.
It's poor little Madeleine who's suffering a bit.
Oh, nothing, but she's fragile.
It would please her to see you.
And... if you could come right away...
That's it, that's it.
He's rushing, the fool.
- What are they saying?
- I can't hear.
But what are they saying?
In front of Madame, I dare not use the keyhole.
Adrien, you're a born gentleman.
Overlook the entry.
That will be done, Madame. Besides, he'll be there in a minute.
But I'm telling you I must leave for Deauville.
Ah convenience, duties, at my age,
I assure you, I find that ridiculous.
Listen, you've just asked two things of me that are... difficult.
To send back mom, send back Adrien.
I tried to please you.
But that, I can't, it's too much.
What, to ask my mistress to leave with me, to come to a small quiet corner where we can be happy, it's too much?
I don't understand why you insist when it's such a pain not to follow you.
Then for a Grand Prix, for regattas, for parties you can make fun of, you've hurt me and taken from me the only thing I wanted.
Listen Madeleine, I'm not demanding it of you, I want it from you.
I want it, I've needed it these past 15 days, I've needed it terribly.
- Get up.
- Not until you say yes.
- Get up, Lucien.
- What is with you?
Excuse me for intruding but Adrien opened the door the moment I arrived.
- I wasn't expecting you.
- I believe you easily, Madeleine.
But your mother called me to tell me you were sick.
It's your mother, and well, she's yours.
Since you're settled now, return where you came from.
But Lucien!
Jean-Pierre...
- Excuse me... - She's sorry to put you out the door but she must all the same.
What are you waiting for?
For you to let Madeleine finish her sentence.
Well since you're there, put him to the door yourself.
- That will be the third time.
- What?
I knew you hadn't had much education, but you're crossing the line.
It's you who must leave.
You're calling me "you"?
Because of her?
You're not welcome here.
Monsieur Moreaux, she has too much spirit to forget him.
And well, what are you waiting for?
Get out.
It's me you're telling that?
Well and you, do you know who I am, why I'm here?
You don't falter, eh? Yes, oh,
I know all about why you're here.
The furniture, the rugs, everything bought.
But not Madeleine, you hear, not Madeleine.
And you, are you thinking about what you're doing?
What you're sacrificing me for?
Huh?
Well, speak! Answer!
Let's go, Monsieur, go away.
Why didn't you tell me you were in such need of money?
Then Lucien, goodbye.
Good luck, and if you think about your buddies, send a postcard.
Goodbye Lucien, and think of your pals.
Say Alfred.
If anyone by chance telephones me, or if they stop by, then tell them I set off again for Orange.
- Understood, you can count on me.
- It's no trouble. Goodbye Lucien.
Monsieur Bourrache, is he here?
To 18. You can go up, he didn't go to work in the morning.
I don't have any reason to stay and meet this Monsieur.
Put it back here, that's his tie.
And that. Look, there are bills inside.
- Of a high number. - Eh?
- Yes.
- Bills in the thousands?
- Perfectly indeed.
Wait, although he didn't warn me, hold on, there are 10 francs for you.
I don't want to receive this Monsieur at all.
- Fine, I'll do the commission.
- Oh, wait, give me the 10 francs then.
After all, this Monsieur, I annoy him.
- What will it be for Monsieur?
- A little quart of Vichy, please.
Have I changed so much?
Oh, Monsieur Bourrache.
You're similar, you've stayed the same.
In two years, change like that...
- Are you sick?
- Yes.
Allow me to finish.
They return from maneuvers, and then you understand.
But anyway, your friend had told us that you'd gone to Paris.
- Yes.
- And what took you suddenly?
- The liver surely.
- Yes, the liver.
- And Monsieur Cailloux is doing well?
- He gets by.
You'll see him in any case.
- Hey, Auguste!
- Who's this again?
It's a visitor. Monsieur Bourrache.
Monsieur Bourrache? Oh, him!
I'm coming!
Bourrache, Bourrache.
I was called something else before here.
It's true. And that suited you well for a while, eh?
Are you here temporarily?
Oh, well I've been here for two months.
- I've managed a little cafe.
- Is it not possible?
Yes, it was called "to my friend Lucien," it's a few kilometers from here.
It's a little club.
Your friend the doctor didn't tell us anything...
He doesn't know, I haven't spoken to him.
Well then, this is a surprise.
How's it going? It's good to see you.
- These hands aren't finished yet?
- Don't you start again, huh.
It's a disease, as soon as there are spahis in the air, it's all she does.
What would you like, Monsieur Lady...
Excuse me, I was going to call you
Lady Killer.
What will you have Monsieur Bourrache?
- As I said: a little glass of Vichy.
- That, that won't do you badly.
Exactly, I was telling Madame Cailloux that for the past two months, I was...
- Here they are! - Excuse me, because that'll be the gunshot...
But make yourself at home here.
Boss, you aren't clinking glasses with us?
No thank you.
Ah alright.
No, I don't drink.
Well my friend, for a bastard!
Oh, don't tire yourself.
I know what you'll tell me...
- Hello!
- Hello René.
Then if Cailloux hadn't warned me, you'd have stayed 10 years without telling me?
Oh y'know, when one has a beloved friend one prefers not to embarrass him.
- But I thought of you.
- Did you think of me?
- Yes.
- I believe Paris is calling you a bit.
- Maybe you're right.
- Well where'd you come from?
Oh... here and there.
Ah, well you see, it's not gleaming here.
I know the house,
I even cared for your predecessor.
A guy who had a big bruise under his nose.
- Do you want something to drink?
- Ah, I'd like that.
- A little glass of white wine?
- A little glass of white wine.
Hey, mute! Get a little glass of white wine then.
Come over here.
You know, my old friend,
I swear to you that... you're blowing my mind.
Ah yes...
Hold on, put that there.
Then, my friend.
Oh, well I had some laughs, that's all.
Then like here, I had a good time, well, I came back.
Are you happy at least?
Now I'm here, I understand this is the only place I'll never have income.
Hold on, why?
Oh, because the age of the Lady Killer is gone and buried.
I must remember that.
When I saw you last time, wasn't that not going so badly?
I didn't tell you everything.
Always this woman.
I'd warned you, my old friend.
Yes, and well I came here.
You know me, I came by quickly, between two visits, a story to scold you a little, but let's speak no more.
You'll dine with me tomorrow, eh?
If you like sad stories...
You'll meet a woman.
- Did you get married?
- Not again, but I waited a long time for a certain thing that finally arrived.
- And are you happy?
- Yes, my friend.
Figure, 15 days ago, someone called me at the hotel of the good winegrower, about a sick customer.
I got there grumbling, and 20 minutes after leaving her,
I loved her.
Oh, for that, seconds are enough, go on.
But you know, one of these women, far too beautiful, who feels sad or cheerful without reason, ready to do anything that goes through their head.
You think you'll tell her something extraordinary... you look in her eyes, and you no longer dare to say anything at all.
Ah, you're a kid René.
But what if to be a kid was the first happiness you gave a woman?
That's what you said.
Oh I remember, I remember.
And has she always lived in Orange?
And exactly, a Parisian, she has no name here, nothing can keep her here...
She doesn't know that I, all these nights, I dine with her.
This is good proof that... anyway.
And all the nights you did nothing but dine with her?
Oh my friend but it's not just an adventure...
When you see her tomorrow, you'll understand.
Ah, I'm not at all a presentable friend, go on.
But Madeleine has very simple tastes, surely she'll like you.
Ah, my little guy, I must leave, someone's expecting me.
- Can I count on you for tomorrow?
- Yes.
But you're shaking, my friend, what is it? Life sorts itself out.
- Life?
- But yes, of course.
Then say, 8:00. I don't need to tell you where my house is.
Go, old Toto, I'm happy to have seen you again.
- Go , until tomorrow.
- Until tomorrow.
Until tomorrow, 8:00.
Don't be late.
No Madame, still nothing.
Besides this discretion you had asked us to return the most difficult research.
There are several traces in their passages, but maybe he's settled in...
- Try again, what do you want?
- But we'll do the impossible, Madame.
- I don't doubt it.
- At your service, Madame.
- Finally!
- A customer on the verge of death,
I didn't dare make you wait, so you could hurry yourself a bit.
There's a train there, you won't soon have any more clientele.
Allow me to be with you the whole time.
- You would quickly get tired.
- Oh, I don't believe...
Let's go, don't be dull and don't act like a pecked dog.
- Where are we dining?
- Chateuneuf-du-Pape.
- Is it good? - Oh, you know the Pope would never be stingy.
- Do you want any cherries?
- I'm not hungry anymore.
- But you didn't eat anything...
- I'm too happy, I can't.
If you're happy during the day, you're very pitiable.
You understand, I never knew true happiness.
But everything has changed,
Madeleine.
I feel so strongly that I don't dare say a word one should never pronounce.
Do you want to scare me?
- You brought me luck.
- Knock on wood.
You understand, in my trade, in everything, I feel at peace.
And, it's stupid to say, but like I'm invincible.
Everything was ruined for a few years, but now everything is right again.
You know the customer who didn't want to decide to die?
And well, I think I saved him.
Because I wasn't afraid of being audacious.
I sent a long study to a review in Paris that some didn't reply to, but it'll be published. I lost a friend,
I found him again.
- All that because of me?
- Because of your influence...
A friend from whom I'd heard nothing for months...
- May I introduce you to him?
- Is he a doctor?
Ah no, I knew him in the regiment, a very simple guy.
One would have no doubt seeing him today that he was called Lady Killer.
That's nice.
Bah, the women loved him.
He had some hard times.
I found him again aged ten years, sad to scare him.
He has a cafe over there, with a small gas station.
Would it bother you to have dinner with him at my place tomorrow?
Why, do you think I'll be bored?
Hey, my friend Lucien.
You're the first, you know?
Ah women, you know what it's like, eh?
- How are you? - I must ask you that, you don't seem well.
- I slept poorly.
- Ah, I can see that.
I'll examine you seriously whenever you want.
- Oh just a little fatigue, it's nothing. - You see, here's the house.
I'm calm inside between my servant
Julie and my dog Laurie.
Everything is as charming and provincial as one might want.
And the garden, do you think it's rather traditional?
You'd be wrong to pity yourself,
René.
Ah, I made plans to rejuvenate all that.
- For a Parisian, more modern things are necessary. - Of course.
Then I'll lay everything out better while only keeping the quaint framework.
- Can that be fun? - Come look, I have a corner where I could almost make a park.
Ah yes. Hold on, what do you think?
- Yes. - Ah? - Yes.
Ah for the moment this is investigated enough, but I think pruning a little, while passing one to two avenues, would be very nice.
Ah you understand, I want that
Madeleine, when we move in here...
I beg your pardon, friend, I speak only of myself, of my projects.
But that's only natural, René.
Yesterday you didn't have time to say anything to me.
I'd like to know a little...
Oh, this is already far.
When I saw you at the congress, that wasn't going so badly... with the exception of your great fear of the pneumatic patients.
Ah yes, and well, they came in bigger and bigger numbers... until the day when they didn't come in at all.
Wholesale, that's the story of my life.
Monsieur! Monsieur, you have a letter at the hotel from the good winegrower.
- The winegrower? You may...
- Go, go.
It's from Madeleine.
She's not coming.
A little illness, she's sorry, she cut her telephone line for some peace.
Ah, my poor friend, you see how it is, eh.
Hold on, I'll telephone her right away, maybe she's not in bed yet.
- It's not worth the trouble since she said-- - Oh well, I risk nothing to try.
René!
René!
Hotel of the good winegrower?
Madame Courtois, please.
Yes, I know, but this is from the doctor Dauphin.
Insist, I beg you.
René, it's not worth the trouble, she won't answer.
- She doesn't want to answer.
- Huh? I don't understand.
You don't know her well, go away.
Leave it. Leave it, I'm telling you.
What's going on with you?
Listen, can I speak with both of you, can I say something?
Yesterday when you told me about
Madeleine,
I understood right away who she was and what she came to do at Orange.
And that's why I couldn't sleep.
Do you know who Madeleine is?
Pardon Monsieur?
- Hello Madame. - You don't know a little cafe in the vicinity, with a gas station, held by a Monsieur Bourrache?
Bourrache? Bourrache?
Lucien Bourrache.
Lucien? Ah, there's a little cafe called "to my friend Lucien," with a gas pump. It's not by here.
- Can you show me? - You must go over there, turning towards the boulder, see?
Go over your steps. And then over there on the road, to the crossroads, on the right, you can ask someone who will show you.
- They're very kind people over there.
- Thank you.
- Goodbye Madame.
- Goodbye.
Oh, she sincerely loved me, only she loved me in her own way, there it is.
Enough to complicate life a little.
Enough to sacrifice me for a caretaker, her mother...
Only, I found myself in front of the other then...
I know what you're thinking:
"he's jealous, it's out of vexation and a grudge that he speaks."
But what I knew, I don't want to know it, understand?
This isn't a woman for you, all the projects you do for her aren't her type.
I'm going to the trouble for you, eh, my old friend?
Pardon, but what one wants when one has a friend, when one is obliged to...
Then according to you, if she is there, if she stays there, it's because she's looking for you?
And all while leading me to believe she liked me, it's you she continued loving?
- I don't know.
- You didn't conserve me.
But now I can respond.
This whole novel you make up about a woman on your pursuit, it's a joke.
But I saw her, joyous.
I saw her, happy, I did.
- She's screwing you over, old friend.
- Let's see, René, what...
For each woman, you think you're Lady
Killer, but I don't carry that weight.
A woman can prefer me to you without being crazy for it.
But I already told you what she was and how she lived...
But what do you want to be done to me when she's behind me?
I love her enough to come by there.
I test my luck against unimportant things.
Even against you.
Everything that I said, it was for you.
Oh, go on, you must forget that.
Squeeze my hand.
Oh well, we would have done better not to have seen each other again.
Then I'll wait for you to give me a sign René?
No, no, I won't disturb you.
I know the way.
Aren't you done with your music, both of you, no?
Fuck off now, get out, go!
- I'm not hurting anyone, I'm waiting for the bus. - It passes by the bridge.
- I'm sick, I'll close up. Go on.
- I need time to finish my glass!
You'll finish your glass tomorrow.
Fuck off, I'm telling you!
My friend, when we see each other again here, we'll have words.
But I don't care.
And you, go to bed,
I'm going to close.
What did you come to do here?
Do you demand it of me?
Oh, with you the reason one supposes is never the right one.
It's difficult to say.
Well, here, I wasn't able to forget you.
- What do you hope for?
- To bring you back to Paris.
And to start over everything again?
I know that the days weren't easy over there.
But now look at where you are and how you live...
I know, I know.
Now, I'll fix everything up.
I hurt you without knowing it.
And I want so badly to be on good terms with you.
Oh, you always had kind words.
That didn't prevent the rest.
Well, do you know a lot of women who would have just recognized their wrong?
And to ask you forgiveness, in the state you're in?
Aand the other, Moreaux,
- does he know why you left?
- Yes.
Then it's over?
I promise you, I swear to you that you'll never see him.
You won't even know he exists.
Listen to me Lucien,
I want you to leave here.
Do you realize the occasion
I'm offering you?
Ah very well, I assure you.
And you say nothing?
You hesitate?
Why not tell me what you've been doing here these past 15 days?
I looked for you.
Ah yes? And René the doctor, what do you think about him?
Oh, if I had to think something about everyone I'd run away.
And him at least, you know what he thinks of you, yes?
A woman alone, he was there, he kept me company, the rest...
Do you know that René is my only friend?
But are you jealous? Have him!
That would give me pleasure.
No, not a thing like that between René and me, it's impossible, go on.
But I thought you were joking, your pal
René, I find you dull, I find him silly.
Why didn't you tell him that?
- Tomorrow he'll know.
- Tomorrow it will be too late.
- What do you want me to do?
- What I want is for you to leave.
Don't stay here a minute longer,
I'll have the right to reproach him.
Do you want me to call him on the phone, in front of you?
- You would dare do that?
- Right away.
But he loves you! It's a great love he has for you.
- It will pass.
- Listen, he doesn't expect anything.
- It will be terribly painful for him.
- At his age, he needs that...
Don't do that Madeleine, don't do that, save him.
Leave me alone, it's not just you who has desires, I do too. Worse for him.
You want proof, I'll give it to you.
Hello René?
It's Madeleine.
No, I'm not at my hotel.
That means I go where I want to go.
Listen my little René, get it through your head once and for all, that between you and me, there never was anything.
And your company has ceased to amuse me, goodnight.
Do you believe me now?
Do you realize what you've just done?
Don't ask me what's important,
I know.
- Go away. Fuck off.
- Lucien?
It was necessary for him to heal, but look at him now.
- But Orange for you is over, eh.
- It was to show me...
Yes, show me what you're worth. But
I hadn't forgotten it, don't worry.
Telephone Moreaux then, as you have just done. Eh?
In that tone. He has money, that'll keep him going.
But a sucker you are to do all that, on nobody's account.
- Never you mind... - But it's you who allow that, do you still love me Lucien?
But don't, don't even look at me, you hear? Go away, I want to be alone.
To blubber in my corner, even to break down, but alone! Alone, you hear?
I have my account.
Ah you have your account?
And you imagine I'll leave like that?
Well, I'll have you when I want.
And what you knew was nothing besides what I reserve for you.
Oh, I understand. You fear nothing, go on.
Waiting on me for hours, during the day.
That will start again whenever
I want.
You'll sit around under my windows.
You'll phone me day and night.
And I swear to you that my attendants will treat you as necessary.
Whenever I want, you hear?
I already knew that.
Oh, but you didn't think of everything, my little Lucien.
And what if tomorrow, René became my lover?
- After what you've just done?
- I'll tell him that you forced me.
At least for him it will be less stupid.
- If you dare do that... - There will never be such a small beginning.
No but who do you take me for?
Maybe you'd want me to roll at the feet of a... Bistro.
Watch what you say, Madeleine.
"They call me the Lady Killer,
"it's idiotic, it's the first time I've found it stupid in front of a woman."
Lady Killer! No but Lady Killer, look at yourself in the mirror.
And then your hands, your nails, you must wash those for me.
- The little René, he at least, is clean. - Madeleine.
You want me to call him? In a few minutes, I'll have resumed it again.
I can already hear what he'll tell me:
"my little Madeleine, I was so hurt..."
"But since you'll be close to me, everything will be well again.
"I can no longer bear to be without you."
Hold on, he'll even tell me: "since you're here, all is in the past."
And he'll come walking back, the fool.
When he'll know why I came to his place.
ENOUGH!
Oh but your anger doesn't frighten me my little Lucien.
You want me to leave?
Well you know where I'm going.
WILL YOU SHUT UP?
WILL YOU SHUT UP, HUH?
- Lucien!
- WILL YOU SHUT UP?
I'VE HEARD ENOUGH OF YOU!
WILL YOU SHUT UP?
Sorry, sorry...
You've said enough...
Let me go, let me go..
Here's the bus.
René.
- What do you want? - You know when
I came back to my place... well, Madeleine was there.
All that's useless, go.
Leave me alone.
I don't know anymore... René...
Madeleine is dead.
What did you say?
I no longer know where I am,
I understand nothing...
I don't know whether I must flee, or denounce myself, for me it's the same but... tell me what I must do, but help me, tell me what
I must do, tell me.
Hey, it's to me that you came..
But I loved her, René, I loved her more than you, I loved her as much as you.
Denounce me... give me a thrashing...
Help me... help me...
Drive me, René... Drive me.
I beg you, Lucien, make an effort.
In a few hours you'll be in Marseille, you'll leave right away.
When you're in Africa, you'll understand what needs to be done.
You know where you can disappear.
If you knew, she said:
"I'll have René first and you after..."
Be quiet, my friend, be quiet.
Hold on to your ticket here,
I'm putting it there.
And money. I'll send the rest to you over there.
I'll do everything I can.
Get ready, let's go.
Here's your train.
- I'd like to tell you... - Don't say anything... it's not worth the trouble.
"Cast of Characters"
Here we are at Don Rosalio's hacienda.
- Cheer up, boys. Santa Rosa is there.
- Come on, boys!
The Zapatistas are here
- Long live Zapata!
- They're Zapatistas?
Yeah, he's Don Eufemio.
I'll go tell the boss.
Are they Zapatistas or government forces?
I don't care. But I have something good for the Zapatistas.
- Who are they, Jeronimo?
- Zapata's men.
Don Eufemio himself and his people.
O.K. Prepare the patio, booze and barbecue and lots of tortillas, they must be starving.
And pulque to cheer them up.
- Hurry!
- Yes, boss.
You see, Atenogenes?
Zapata's men!
Then, long live Emiliano
Zapata, Don Rosalio.
"Long live General Huerta"
"Long live Emiliano Zapata"
Long live Emiliano Zapata!
General, you know this is your house.
We need it.
My men are exhausted.
Don't worry the banquet is prepared with lots of booze and pulque.
Everything for the soldiers of the Revolution!
Thank you. Do you know
General Felipe Nieto?
I've heard a lot about him, who hasn't?
I've heard of you too.
I wanted to come shake the hand of the best friend of the Revolution.
- That's right.
- Come in, you must be thirsty.
Trinidad, you and Jeronimo take care of the boys.
I'm very pleased with the latest triumphs of the Revolution.
I wanted to see you or your brother
Don Emiliano to congratulate you.
Emiliano is busy, but he'll be around one of these days.
When you least expect him.
You know the General.
When you least expect him.
You know the General.
That's the game.
If someone gets in your way answer with a bullet first of all.
When he comes from a spree his friends all sing of him, with a good reason.
Cause he has a hundred scars from his toes to his nose
He's a killer...
You had a good breakfast?
- A delicious meal.
- Thank you.
No, I have something better for you, General.
Look Rosalio,
Felipe is out of mind.
Wait and you'll look how dottering she is.
She's a deaf mute, but she understands you better... reading the lips... than Atenogenes with his big ears.
Hey, Don Rosalio!
- This is the good stuff.
- Thank you.
Here, Don Eufemio.
I don't like it. You have some.
No, Atenogenes, you drink mezcal.
This is only for Zapata's
Generals.
No, cognac, no cigar...
It's very good.
I don't like it. Give me a man's drink.
Do you, prefer mezcal?
Then I drink with you, General.
To the triumph of the Revolution.
Long live Zapata!
What do you say?
It's 20 new machine guns and 100 rifles.
I think it isn't expensive
Just imagine if the Federal troops knew about it.
There's no bargaining with a friend like you.
I know Emiliano can get mad with me, but I'll buy them.
Besides, we need them.
Hey, Don Rosalio,
I don't know how you do it with the government.
My faith in a just cause makes me sly.
You know I hate romanticism and sighs... but I dedicated life and money to the Revolution.
Even if they shoot me.
Thank you.
You're a real man...
- and Zapata's men appreciate it.
- Thank you.
Long live General Zapata.
Long live General Huerta!
Well, long live the government.
Long live the supreme government!
Long live the supreme government!
Welcome, Colonel Martinez.
I'm glad to see you.
Here we are again,
Don Rosalio.
That deserve another cognac.
Hey Atenogenes.
Bring another bottle of cognac, but... don't touch it, eh?
- I don't, like it!
- He doesn't like it!
Congratulations on the price you got out from that bastard Eufemio.
As I was telling you,
It was a big business...
Just, old weapons that won't be any good to them.
Of course.
I wasn't going to...
I'm here to serve you and the government.
- We must finish off those bandits.
- Yes but take care.
You're lucky they, haven't burned your hacienda... or hanged you from a tree.
Colonel, everyone dies when his time comes.
Give me that.
And don't forget to send
Zapata... the money he asked for.
Take care of everything.
Will you be in Mexico City long?
I don't know, 8 to 10 days, to check my business there... and say hello to my brothers.
And have a little fling.
You deserve it... a good crop and good business.
From a rifle to a train.
Yes... from a rifle... to a...
OK, there's no place like the capital, but only for a holliday... for business there's nothing like the country and the Revolution.
We can't complaint but you... make five times more.
I told you...
Don't fear the Revolution.
You got scared and came here...
You must be brave to do business.
OK, brother, but don't pervert the boy.
When the Zapatistas or the government... burn your ranch and shoot you we'll see who was right.
- I know how to live.
- Give me the corn accounts.
Good morning, Don Andres.
Good morning, Miss.
Come in.
I've been expecting you for a week.
Sit down here, daughter.
I wanted to come see you since last week... but I couldn't get the money until now.
- How much did you bring?
- Half.
But I hope to bring the rest next week.
OK, but next week.
Don Andres Garcia and his daughter.
They was very rich but the Revolution ruined them.
They owe us a lot.
- Very pretty. Introduce me.
- Sure.
OK, Mr. Garcia. Thank you.
Until next week then.
Don Andres.
This is my brother Rosalio.
At your service.
Glad to meet you. I must rush off to be downtown in five minutes.
I'm going downtown and my car is at the door.
- I'd be glad to drive you.
- I don't want to bother.
It's no bother at all.
My daughter, Dolores.
- At your feet, Miss.
- Glad to meet you.
Go ahead.
But what about the corn?
We'll settle it later.
Now I'm busy.
No, Don Andres. There's nothing more to talk.
We're already at the hacienda and everything is ready.
- We'll get married tomorrow.
- Why such a hurry?
Why wait?
What's said is said.
- Right Dolores?
- Whatever my father says.
Look here I don't like romanticism and sighs.
Things should be done quickly and well.
I want Lolita, you gave me her hand... so let's get married and be done with it.
If you insist and Dolores doesn't object...
Why should she object!
Wait till you see the chapel fixed up for the wedding.
Long live the newlyweds!
- Congratulations, Don Rosalio
- Thanks shorty. Have a drink
Lett's drink to their happiness.
Thank you.
Are you happy?
Yes. It was worth to come from so far for the party.
Come on, even if the Zapatistas shoot us.
Keep playing.
The boss want everyone happy.
Come on.
What a waste of the band.
I brought it from Huichila... and the people look like they're at a funeral.
I don't know what's wrong with these guys.
They're afraid of the Zapatistas.
Even Lolita looks afraid.
Since we came, she only think on them. She's so afraid...
Ever since we got here. My people pushed them to the hills.
Santa Rosa has never been safer.
Come on, we must animate this party! To dance! ...To dance!
To dance, boys!
What happen with those musicians? Music!
Don't be afraid of the Zapatistas.
My men are watching.
Why shouldn't we share of this party?
We should have our own party.
Good thing we brought our own booze, It's a hell of a night.
I'm still afraid, Rosalio.
I don't know why.
Don't be silly.
Even if the Zapatistas come... they are my friends.
Don't be silly.
Cognac.
Now I'll get even on the stuff... reserved for Zapata's generals.
You're crazy.
Long live Zapata!
Long live Zapata!
Long live the supreme government!
I've got enough for both.
Come with me.
Music, music.
Colonel... Who would have thought, you were so gallant?
They don't know what you do to the Zapatistas.
Boys remember all that son of a... Martinez owes us.
Well, Don Atenogenes.
That's a good joke.
So you've got enough for
Zapata and the government?
What a night!
Here are the Zapatistas! This time it's truth! You must hide!
The Zapatistas are overthere!
They're coming!
They're coming!
- Come on, it only hits once.
- I'm not joking, they're coming.
Everyone stay put.
No one leaves.
- Where's that son of a... Martinez?
- Here he is, boss.
Keep him for me.
And Rosalio who gave the party?
Here I am, at your service and General Zapata's.
We can see. Getting drunk here with the Huertistas.
- Meco!
- At your orders, boss.
Take care of this one and then the Coronel
- and hang them at the entrance!
- No! Not him, please!
Please, General, not my husband!
So you're the bride?
I need you to keep me company.
But get up.
Such a pretty face.
What?
I'm a friend of Eufemio and Don Emiliano.
Yeah, sure.
Don't go on because I'll kill you for scientist and reactionary.
Meco, get on with these two!
No he's your friend,
I'll tell you! Please, no!
Just remember you're killing a friend of Emiliano.
What's going on?
Don't you see?
Executing these two.
I told you not to mess with the owner of the hacienda.
For the love of God, don't hurt him.
They won't. Let him go.
Thank you, General. If you hadn't gotten here in time...
But how can you defend our enemies?
Emiliano wants us to respect him.
Shoot the other one.
Felipe, I won't tolerate your whims.
No one has made a fool of me, yet.
- Didn't you hear? Shoot him.
- And him too.
Settle for one.
You'll pay double for this, son of a...!
He's to blood thirsty.
Thank you again, General.
I'll never forget it.
Me neither.
We'll never forget it.
Don't worry about it.
We would be delighted to see you here again.
Santa Rosa is your house.
Give Emiliano a hug and come see me whenever you can.
Of course, whenever I'm in the area, I'll come.
- See you soon.
- I hope it will be true.
I'd wish all Zapatistas were like him.
Yes, really a good friend.
I missed you.
I'd gotten used to seeing you often. Right, Dolores?
If you don't come for a few days, he only talks about it.
I heard you were here a week ago and didn't come see us.
I couldn't come that time.
The Revolution is demanding.
"Tepepan" and "Tuerto" were all around... and I have to watch them.
It's a pitty all Zapatistas aren't like you.
We can't do nothing about it.
You only get into it if you wan't to.
One day there will be justice for those of us who fight for ideals.
I forget everything with you.
I feel if it were peacetime.
I want to rest...
- Why don't you leave the Revolution?
- Today we have a duty to comply.
One day, when the Plan Ayala wins... and all is peace... and peasants own the land... we may be glad to remember it all.
Well I play.
Hey General! It's the fourth one and you're falling asleep.
- Another, if you go on...
- Don't drink anymore.
Leave me alone, I'm very happy.
Yes, I can tell you've got something up your sleeve.
Yes. A big news
Well, tell me it.
What is it?
- Shall we tell him?
- No, please.
I'll tell him.
Well do, I'm intrigued.
Look what Dolores is knitting.
Please, Rosalio.
Did you get it, General?
Shake.
You're right to be happy.
- When will it be?
- October, I think.
And you'll be the baby's godfather, will you?
- Sure. And let's drink to it.
- Ok, General.
- In October, eh?
- Yes.
General, how did you dare with the government forces so near?
I heard Lolita gave birth... and
I came to see her and the baby.
They'll be delighted. Come in.
How could you take such a risk?
I sneaked away to find out if it's a boy or a girl, and how Lolita is.
How can I ever thank you?
Dolores is fine... and it's a boy.
He'll be a great man and
I'll name him after me.
No, Rosalio is a very ugly name.
We'll name him after his godfather,
Felipe. What do you think?
Thank you.
Go in and see them. It is very dangerous for you here.
You look like a kid when you play with him.
You look more dazed than us.
When I play with him I forget about Federals... and the Revolution and everything.
I'll bring you a cognac, the kind you like.
No, then my namesake doesn't like my breath.
You exaggerate, it's good cognac.
Sometimes I'm jealous, you love him so much.
Do you want to steal him?
You shouldn't be jealous,
I love him because... he's yours.
Go on.
General Nieto!
What the hell is it?
Don Emiliano sent me,
The Carrancistas are coming and he needs you.
Damm Carrancistas!
Let's go.
Take the child.
- Goodbye.
- So long.
Let's go
Poor Felipe, this life year after year.
Yes, the government is hitting them pretty hard.
Forgive me, general...
I don't understand... how you get a lot of risks to visit Santa Rosa.
I care very much for the
Mendozas...
- and their boy.
- Boy.
- I think you care for someone else...
- Shut up, you idiot!
Don't get mad. I just wanted to give you a piece of advice...
Why don't we attack the ranch, kill Rosalio... burn the hacienda and take the woman?
Don't be stupid!
Rosalio is my buddy.
I love him like a brother.
Ok, boss.
You see how pretty it is?
Let's go to sleep?
Well, let's go to sleep.
Come on, baby.
Lord God...
Watch over me and my parents.
Watch over me and my parents.
- And not for my godfather?
- Yes, him more than anyone.
God hear you and keep him.
- Why hasn't he come?
- He can't but he will.
I want him to come... and play horsie with me.
How do you like the saddle
I brought you, little namesake?
They made it special for you.
You like it?
- Yes, lift me up.
- Ok.
Let go of him.
I've got him trained.
He'll be a great horseman.
Look at the posture.
Let him with me and you'll see.
I miss you. Why do you take so long to come?
Because the Carrancistas make me run.
But whenever I can I come.
Why don't you shoot them and make them run?
There are too many of them.
What a great friend Felipe is.
If it weren't for the damm Revolution.
It's getting worse, we'll have to go to Mexico City.
Why are you becoming so fearful?
You didn't used to be so.
I was younger... and I didn't have you...
...and the boy.
What are you doing Atenogenes?
I finally got it, was very hard get it.
Imagine getting a picture of
Carranza amongst his worst enemies.
They'll arive today, now we can shout, long live Carranza!
- Colonel Bernaldez is here.
- Come on, Atenogenes.
Welcome, Colonel Bernaldez.
Long live Carranza, boys!
Long live Zapata!
Long live General Nieto!
Death to Carranza!
Shut up, you rude boy!
Don't worry, Mendoza.
It's child's play.
- What do you think about it?
- Children are terrible.
Put it in the middle so it doesn't spread to much.
Come on, hurry!
- Bored, Colonel?
- I'm tired of all this, Mendoza.
I'm tired of Zapatistas and shooting... and above all that damm
Felipe Nieto.
We can't finish him off.
Why don't you try to get around him?
That isn't possible.
Money isn't for him.
He's not the kind to sell out.
You're right. He's not that kind.
Anyway, I'll get him.
I know he's your friend, but to me he's just a bandit.
He'll get me another star on my hat.
You've got to know how to live, right?
You're a maverick, don't deny it.
You're lucky... but watch out.
Its just a friend's advice.
Remember the Zapatistas were going to shoot you once.
And the government might give you a scare one of these days.
I know why I tell you.
- Wait... talk clearly. Why?
- Well, it's nothing, but...
My advice is not to be too friendly with the Zapatistas.
The government might not like it.
You keep quiet and come pick out a horse.
You're a real pal.
Yes, Dolores. We have to go to Mexico City.
For the child... and for you.
I know what I'm saying.
I'm dying to go. But we will never hear from Felipe again.
Yes, we'll miss my buddy...
But here it's the same...
Colonel Bernaldez pursuits him... and one of these days we'll find he's dead.
- God forbid! Poor Felipe!
- Let's go to sleep.
- Who could it be?
- I don't know. I'll go see.
What is it?
- It sounds like Bernaldez.
- Open up.
Colonel Bernaldez...
I thought you were in Huichila.
I came from there. I need you.
- It's that damm Nieto.
- You caught him?
I'd wish that.
I had him.
Just imagine... we had them surrounded at Huichila.
They're starving, but they've taken 3 wagons of dinamite... and threaten to blow up the town if we don't let them out.
I'll be dammed!
I want you come and talk to him. They don't let us near.
You see? It's good for the government... that I am a friend of the
Zapatistas. Well, Colonel.
Just give me time to dress,
I'll fix everything.
Ok.
Everything will be alright.
Go on to bed.
Calm down, pal, calm...
- Someone want see you boss.
- Who?
Buddy!
You are risking to much.
I'm in a hurry,
I have good news.
I got Bernaldez give you time to leave.
Bernaldez said that?
Tell me again.
Just look at us, buddy.
- Goodbye, buddy.
- For god's sake take care.
For my namesake.
I've been saving it for him.
You're very brave, buddy.
Take it.
Come on take it... your godfather sent it.
It's not true
Why didn't he come?
He couldn't.
But when he comes he will be angry if you didn't accept it. Come on, take it.
I'm more nervous every hour.
You and the boy have made me a coward. When can we leave?
Don't be nervous.
We'll leave whenever you say.
For me, we could leave today... but business has been bad this year.
I need the money from the crop. I need it.
Hurry up!
All ready, boss.
Not a bag missing.
It's been a great crop.
OK.
Put dirt on it.
"Crop Burned by Rebel Attack"
I thought we could soon be in Mexico City, in calm... away from all of this.
Don't worry.
It will all work out.
Mom! Dad!
Silly boy. I want to give you these candies.
I don't want candies...
You're bad.
Child!
Don't pay attention to him.
Of course not.
You'll see, I'll win him over.
Thank you. Excuse me,
I'll put him to bed. It's late.
Come on, Felipe.
- Why so worried, Don Rosalio?
- I'm very worried, Colonel.
My business in Mexico City is bad...
- and the Zapatistas burned my crop.
- Your friends, eh?
Why worry? Don Rosalio.
Just ask for whatever you need.
- Me Colonel?
- Yes, my friend... you
Whatever you need.
- You need money, right?
- Of course.
Well...
I have a great deal for you.
Yes I have a great deal for you... which will also benefit the country... which is in bad shape with all this Revolution.
It was nothing.
I imagined it.
Well, what do you say about the deal?
No, those things can't be done... so the hell take us.
I'm not asking you to do anything wrong. Sleep on it.
And don't worry, man. It's all for the good of the country.
- Well... see you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow, Colonel.
- Felipe.
- Godfather!
You don't know how
I've missed you.
It's your fault for not taking me.
Felipe. I was scared to death for you.
You thought I was in danger all the time.
But here I am, when you least expect it.
How's my buddy?
We were taking a nap.
I'll call him.
No, let him sleep.
I'll see him later.
Felipe, go play over there.
- I'll give you your lesson later.
- At your service, General.
They're wiping us out.
They'll finish us off.
- Don't talk like that!
- Let me finish.
This is one of my last visits, I know.
One of the last times I see you... that's why I dare to tell you.
I want to ask you a favor...
When you know... that I'm dead... and my body is hang... don't forget me.
Remember me always.
I've loved and respected you more than anyone.
I adored you in your son.
Here we are, buddy, eating together.
I thought we would never be like that.
Here we are again, Felipe, drink to the future... and to the triumph of the Revolution.
It's a beautiful night.
- Let's go smoke in the garden...
- Let's go.
The night is lovely.
I'm happy.
We won't be long.
Don't go far, remember,
Colonel is very close.
No, we go only to the garden.
Don't worry.
Listen, buddy...
I wanted to ask you something.
Yes, you know if it's in my power...
It's about
Colonel Bernaldez.
He owes me a lot.
You know that buddy.
It's something patriotic.
Good for you, for him and for the country.
You make it sound great.
You see, Bernaldez wants to change sides.
Let me talk. He wants to be a Zapatista.
I've been watching him and I'm sure he's sincere.
Who can tell...
- That guy is a...
- I'll answer for him.
What have you to lose?
He wants to do it.
Carranza isn't doing well and he is ambitious.
Besides, what have you to lose?
He told me, and
I thought... if he's surrendering, it should be to you.
That's why I am a friend with both of you.
You would be much more influential. Think it over.
Let me think about it.
- Are you afraid of something?
- Me? Nothing buddy.
Not with you in it.
I just don't like Bernaldez.
Look...
Let me set up an interview.
- When?
- Whenever you want.
Just the three of us here at Santa Rosa... we lock up, and you'll see everything will work out.
Tomorrow will be right?
Tell him I'll meet him here tomorrow before sunset.
Thank you.
You know I'm in it.
I know. You know I'd do anything for you.
Then it's all settled?
I was sure it would work.
I'm glad for you and the country.
Shake again, friend. Tomorrow we'll attack with our troops Cuautla.
We owe this to you, Rosalio.
You're a great friend.
Just a patriot, that's all.
And now let's order dinner
I'm hungry.
It's a deal, buddy.
Why not celebrate with a drink?
Sure. I even brought the cognac.
You look more nervous that happy. What's the matter?
Me? Nothing.
I wanna see my godfather.
Shut up, you make me nervous!
The Colonel is bad.
He'll hurt him.
I fear the same thing.
Calm down, it is a meeting to make peace.
Please God, let it be.
She's got you so stuck up.
My dear friend.
My dear friend I don't know what she gave you.
Every time I see here come, she ducks and moves aside.
My dear friend...
My dear friend.
I'd be better off dead.
What that woman has given you.
She's got you so stuck up.
My dear friend.
My dear friend. I don't know what she gave you...
That song drives me crazy!
Calm down. The storm must be making you nervous.
You saw how happily they ate and drunk all three of them.
There's something
Atenogenes.
Why are they in the office, instead of dining with me?
These are delicate matters.
They must be alone.
No, something is going to happen.
I have a feeling.
I'm so frightened.
You, Atenogenes, go to rest.
I told you to go!
Get your coat and the boy's... you're going to Huichila right now I'll meet you there.
- Why?
- Don't ask. I'll tell you later.
- I'm in a hurry.
- What's the matter? I'm frightened.
Put on something and leave.
I'm in a hurry. Come on!
What are you looking at?
You've never seen me?
Get out!
Go to the kitchen.
- Hurry. Give me the boy.
- What are you going to do?
- Please explain.
- Let's go... Hurry!
Jeronimo. Here she is.
Take the boy.
Whatever you say...
But look what a night. Just like the night of the dance...
When the Zapatistas were going to shoot you... and General Nieto saved your life, remember?
Hurry!
Cover the boy!
- I'll catch up later at Huichila.
- What are you going to do?
Let me, I have a lot to do.
Hurry, Jeronimo!
What a night boss... like the night General Nieto saved your life.
Don Rosalio! Don Rosalio!
Where the hell was you?
That bandit is dead.
His head is worth a lot of money.
You and me will be rich men.
Hang him by the gate, in front of the road.
- Not that!
- Leave us alone. You did your part.
Come have a drink and you can now... go back to Mexico City whenever you want.
Come on. Come on.
You see how well it turned out.
Perfectly.
Ok. I don't like romanticism and sighs...
Things should be done quickly and well.
Don't cry, mother.
My godfather can go and see us there too...
What do we care if we were expelled?
The war's gonna start, so we would've left anyhow.
War! Isn't it exciting, Scarlett?
- Those fool Yankees want a war.
We'll show them!
Fiddle-dee-dee. War, war, war!
This war talk's spoiling all the fun at every party.
I get so bored I could scream.
Besides, there isn't going to be any war.
Not gonna be any war?
- Of course there'll be a war.
If either of you boys says "war" once again...
...I'll go in the house.
- But, Scarlett!
- Don't you want us to have a war?
Wait a minute, honey, please!
We're sorry.
Well...
But remember, I warned you.
I've got an idea!
We'll talk about the Wilkes' barbecue at Twelve Oaks.
You're eating barbecue with us, aren't you?
I haven't thought about that yet.
I'll think about that tomorrow.
We want all your waltzes.
First Brent, then me, then Brent, and so on.
- Promise?
- Why, I'd just love to.
If only I didn't have every one of them taken already.
- You can't do that to us!
- We'll tell you a secret.
A secret? Who by?
You know Melanie Hamilton?
Ashley Wilkes' cousin?
She's visiting...
That goody-goody!
Who wants to know about her?
Anyway, we heard... They say...
Ashley Wilkes is gonna marry her.
- Wilkeses always marry their cousins.
Do we get those waltzes?
Of course.
- It can't be true! Ashley loves me!
Scarlett!
- What's gotten into her?
- Suppose we made her mad?
Where are you going without your shawl and the night air coming?
How come you didn't ask them gentlemen to supper?
You got no more manners than a field hand.
After me and Miss Ellen done labored with you!
Come on in before you catch your death of dampness.
No! I'm going to wait for Pa to come home.
Come on in here!
Come on!
Mm-mm-mm!
Quitting time!
- Who says it's quitting time?
- I said.
I's the foreman. I say when it's quitting time at Tara.
Quitting time!
There's none in the county can touch you, and none in the state.
Pa!
How proud of yourself you are!
Well, Katie Scarlett O'Hara, so you've been spying on me.
Like your sister, you'll tell your mother that I was jumping again.
You know I'm no tattletale like Suellen.
But after you broke your knee last year jumping that fence...
I'll not have me own daughter telling me what I shall jump and not jump.
It's my own neck, so it is.
All right, Pa, you jump what you please.
- How are they at Twelve Oaks?
- The Wilkeses?
In the stew you'd expect with a barbecue and talking nothing but war.
Bother the war!
Was there anyone else there?
Their cousin Melanie and her brother, Charles.
Melanie Hamilton is a pale-faced, mealy-mouthed ninny!
Ashley Wilkes doesn't think so.
Ashley Wilkes couldn't like anyone like her.
What's your interest in Ashley and Miss Melanie?
Nothing. Let's go into the house.
Has he been trifling with you?
Has he asked you to marry him?
- No.
- Nor will he.
I had it in strict confidence from John Wilkes today...
...Ashley's going to marry Melanie.
It'll be announced tomorrow night at the ball.
I don't believe it!
Here! Where are you off to?
Scarlett!
What are you about?
Have you been running after a man who's not in love with you?
When you might have any other?
I haven't been running after him, it's just a surprise.
Now, don't be jerking your chin at me!
If Ashley wanted to marry you,
I'd have misgivings.
I want my girl to be happy.
You'd not be happy with him.
I would! I would!
What's the difference who you marry?
So long as he's a Southerner.
And when I'm gone
I'll leave Tara to you.
I don't want it.
It doesn't mean anything...
Do you mean to tell me,
Katie Scarlett O'Hara...
...that land doesn't mean anything to you?
Land is the only thing in the world worth working for...
...worth fighting for, worth dying for.
- It's the only thing that lasts!
- You talk like an Irishman.
It's proud I am that I'm Irish.
Don't you be forgetting...
...that you're half Irish too.
To anyone with a drop of Irish blood in them...
...the land they live on is like their mother.
But there now. You're just a child.
It'll come to you, this love of the land.
There's no getting away from it if you're Irish.
Here she comes!
Scarlett, Suellen, Carreen, your mama's home!
Acting like a wet nurse to them white-trash Slatterys...
...instead of eating her supper.
Set up the fire!
Got no business wearing herself out...
Pork! Take the lamp out on the porch.
Wearing herself out.
Mr. Gerald, Miss Ellen's home!
Waiting on them poor white trash.
Shut up, dog!
Barking in the house!
Get up from there!
Don't you hear Miss Ellen?
Get out there and get her medicine chest!
We was worried about you, Miss Ellen.
It's all right, Pork. I'm home.
Mrs. O'Hara, we finished plowing the creek bottom today.
What do you want me to start on tomorrow?
Mr. Wilkerson, I've just come from Emmie Slattery's bedside.
Your child has been born.
My child, ma'am?
I'm sure I don't understand.
Has been born and mercifully has died.
Good night, Mr. Wilkerson.
I fix your supper myself and you eats it.
- Yes, after prayers, Mammy.
- Yes'm.
Mr. O'Hara, you must dismiss Jonas Wilkerson.
Dismiss him, Mrs. O'Hara?
He's the best overseer in the county.
He must go tomorrow morning, the first thing!
- No.
- Yes.
The Yankee Wilkerson and the white-trash Slattery girl?
- We'll discuss it later, Mr. O'Hara.
- Yes, Mrs. O'Hara.
Scarlett's dress is prettier than mine!
Can't she wear my pink dress?
I wanna wear Scarlett's green dress.
I don't like your tone, Suellen.
Your pink gown's lovely.
Can't I stay up for the ball?
- You may wear my garnets.
Why can't I stay up for the ball tomorrow?
Scarlett. You look tired, my dear.
I'm worried about you.
I'm all right, Mother.
Why can't I stay up for the ball?
I'm 13 now.
You may go to the barbecue.
I didn't want your tacky dress anyhow!
- Hush up!
Prayers, girls.
- And to all the saints, that I have sinned in thought, word and deed...
...through my fault, through my fault, through my most grievous fault.
Therefore, I beseech thee, blessed Mary, ever virgin...
...blessed Michael the Archangel...
...blessed John the Baptist...
...the Holy Apostles, Peter and Paul, and all the saints...
...pray to the Lord...
Ashley doesn't know I love him.
I'll tell him that I love him...
...and then he can't marry.
Hear thee Almighty, most merciful Lord...
...grant us pardon, absolution and remission of our sins. Amen.
Ooh!
Just hold on and suck in!
Mammy, here's
Miss Scarlett's vittles.
Take it back to the kitchen.
I won't eat a bite.
Yes'm, you is!
You's gonna eat every mouthful.
No, I'm not!
Put on the dress.
We're late already.
- What my lamb gonna wear?
- That.
No, you ain't! You can't show your bosom before 3:00!
I'm gonna speak to your ma!
If you say one word to mother,
I won't eat a bite.
Well...
Keep your shawl on. I ain't aiming for you to get freckled...
...after the buttermilk I done put on you, bleaching them freckles.
Now, Miss Scarlett. You come on and be good and eat just a little, honey.
No! I'm going to have a good time today and eat at the barbecue.
If you don't care what folks says, I does!
You can always tell a lady by how she eats in front of folks like a bird.
I ain't aiming for you to go to
John Wilkes' and gobble like a hog!
Fiddle-dee-dee!
Ashley told me he likes girls with a healthy appetite.
What gentlemens says and thinks is different things.
And I ain't noticed Mr. Ashley asking for to marry you.
Now don't eat too fast. Ain't no need a having it come right back up again.
Why is it a girl has to be so silly to catch a husband?
Scarlett O'Hara! If you're not down here by the time I count 10...
...we'll go without you!
- I'm coming, Pa!
One, two, three, four, five...
Oh, dear!
My stays are so tight, I'll never get through the day without belching!
Well, John Wilkes.
- It's a grand day for the barbecue.
- So it seems, Gerald.
Why isn't Mrs. O'Hara with you?
She's settling accounts with the overseer, but she'll be along tonight.
- Welcome to Twelve Oaks, Mr. O'Hara.
- Thank you kindly, India.
Your daughter's getting prettier every day, John.
Here are the O'Hara girls.
We must greet them.
I can't stand Scarlett.
She throws herself at Ashley.
That's your brother's business.
You must remember your duties as hostess.
Good morning, girls.
You're looking lovely.
Good morning, Scarlett.
India Wilkes, what a lovely dress!
I just can't take my eyes off it.
Good morning, Miss Scarlett.
You look mighty fine this morning, Miss Scarlett.
It's a pleasure to see you,
Miss Scarlett.
Ashley!
Scarlett, my dear!
I've been looking for you everywhere.
I've got something I must tell you.
Can't we go someplace quiet?
Yes, I'd like to, but I have something to tell you too.
Something I hope you'll be glad to hear.
Come say hello to my cousin Melanie first.
Oh, do we have to?
She's been looking forward to seeing you again. Melanie!
Here's Scarlett.
- Scarlett!
I'm so glad to see you again.
Melanie, what a surprise to run into you here.
I hope you'll stay with us a few days.
I hope I shall stay long enough for us to become real friends.
- I do want us to be.
- We'll keep her here, won't we?
We'll make the biggest fuss over her!
If anybody can give a girl a good time, it's Ashley.
Our good times must seem silly to you. You're so serious.
Oh, Scarlett, you have so much life.
I've always admired you.
I wish I could be more like you.
You mustn't flatter me and say things you don't mean.
Nobody could accuse Melanie of being insincere. Could they, my dear?
She's not like you, is she, Ashley?
He never means a word he says to any girl.
Why, Charles Hamilton, you handsome old thing, you!
But, Miss O'Hara, I...
Was it kind to bring your good-looking brother here to break my poor heart?
Now that Charles is your beau, she's after him like a hornet.
Charles, I want to eat barbecue with you.
Don't go philandering with any other girl, because I'm mighty jealous.
I won't, Miss O'Hara.
I couldn't!
I do declare, Frank Kennedy! You look dashing with those new whiskers.
Thank you, thank you, Miss Scarlett.
Charles and Wade asked me to eat with them, but I told them I promised you.
You needn't be so amused.
She's after your beau now.
That's mighty flattering of you,
Miss Scarlett.
I'll see what I can do.
Why's your sister mad?
You sparking her beau?
As if I couldn't do better than that old maid in britches.
Brent and Stuart, you handsome old things!
- I didn't mean it. I'm mad at you!
- What have we done?
You haven't been near me all day!
I wore this old dress for you.
I was counting on eating with you.
- You are, Scarlett.
- Of course you are, honey.
I never can make up my mind which of you is the handsomest.
I was awake all last night trying to figure it out.
Oh, shucks!
- Cathleen, who's that?
- Who?
That man looking at us and smiling.
The nasty dark one.
Don't you know? That's Rhett Butler.
He's from Charleston.
He has a most terrible reputation.
He looks as if he knows what I look like without my shimmy.
My dear, he isn't received.
He spends his time up North because his folks won't speak to him.
He was expelled from West Point, he's so fast.
And there's that business about the girl he wouldn't marry.
Tell, tell!
He took her out buggy-riding in the late afternoon without a chaperon...
...and then he refused to marry her!
No, but she was ruined just the same.
Ashley...
- Happy?
- So happy.
You seem to belong here...
...as if it had all been imagined for you.
I like to feel that I belong to the things you love.
- You love Twelve Oaks as I do.
- Yes, Ashley.
I love it as more than a house.
It's a whole world that wants only to be graceful and beautiful.
It's so unaware that it may not last forever.
You're afraid of what may happen if the war comes?
But we don't have to be afraid for us.
No war can come into our world, Ashley.
Whatever comes, I'll love you...
...just as I do now, until I die.
Isn't this better than a table?
A girl hasn't got but two sides to her at a table.
- I'll get her dessert.
- She said me!
Allow me, Miss O'Hara?
I think...
I think Charles Hamilton may get it.
Thank you, Miss O'Hara.
Thank you!
Go get it, boy!
Isn't he the luckiest...
Miss O'Hara...
...I love you.
I don't guess I'm as hungry as I thought.
Why do I have to take a nap?
I'm not tired.
Well-brought-up ladies takes naps at parties.
It's time you behave and act like you was Miss Ellen's daughter.
When we were in Saratoga,
I didn't see Yankee girls taking naps.
And you won't see no Yankee girls at the ball, neither.
How was Ashley today?
He didn't pay much attention to you.
You mind your own business!
You'll be lucky you don't lose whisker-face Kennedy.
You're sweet on Ashley, and his engagement's being announced tonight.
That's as much as you know.
You ought to behave yourself!
Acting like poor white-trash children!
If you's old enough for parties, you should act like ladies!
Who cares?
We've borne enough insults from the Yankees.
We'll keep our slaves with or without their approval.
'Twas the sovereign right of
Georgia to secede from the Union.
The South must assert herself by force of arms.
After we've fired on the Yankee rascals at Fort Sumter, we've got to fight.
- There's no other way.
That's right!
Let the Yankees ask for peace.
The situation's very simple.
The Yankees can't fight and we can.
There won't be a battle.
They'll turn and run.
One of us can lick 20 Yanks.
We'll beat them in one battle.
Gentlemen can always fight better than rabble.
Gentlemen always fight better.
What does the captain of our Troop say?
Well, gentlemen, if Georgia fights, I go with her.
I hope the Yankees let us leave the Union in peace.
Ashley, they've insulted us!
You can't mean you don't want war?
Most of the miseries of the world were caused by wars.
And when the wars were over, no one ever knew what they were about.
Now, gentlemen. Mr. Butler's been up North, I hear.
Don't you agree with us?
I think it's hard winning a war with words.
What do you mean, sir?
There's not a cannon factory in the whole South.
What difference does that make to a gentleman?
It'll make a great difference to a great many gentlemen, sir.
Are you hinting that the Yankees can lick us?
No, I'm not hinting.
I'm saying plainly, the Yankees are better equipped than we.
They've got factories, shipyards, coal mines...
...and a fleet to bottle up our harbors and starve us.
All we've got is cotton and slaves, and arrogance.
I refuse to listen to any renegade talk!
- I'm sorry if the truth offends you.
- Apologies aren't enough, sir.
I hear you were turned out of West Point, Mr. Rhett Butler.
And you aren't received in any family in Charleston.
Not even your own!
I apologize again for all my shortcomings.
Perhaps you won't mind if
I look over your place?
I seem to be spoiling everybody's brandy and cigars...
...and dreams of victory.
That's what you can expect from somebody like Rhett Butler.
You did everything but call him out.
- He refused to fight.
- Not quite there, Charles.
- He refused to take advantage of you.
- Take advantage of me?
He's one of the best shots in the country, as he's proved many times.
- He's got steadier hands than yours.
- Well, I'll show him!
Please. Don't go tweaking his nose anymore.
You may be needed for more important fighting.
If you'll excuse me,
Mr. Butler's our guest.
I think I'll just show him around.
Ashley!
Ashley...
Scarlett.
Who are you hiding from in here?
What are you up to?
Why aren't you upstairs, resting with the other girls?
What is this, Scarlett, a secret?
Oh, Ashley...
Ashley!
- I love you.
- Scarlett!
I love you, I do!
Isn't it enough that you gathered every other man's heart today?
You've always had mine.
You cut your teeth on it.
Don't tease me now.
Have I your heart, my darling?
I love you, I love you!
You mustn't say such things.
You'll hate me for hearing them.
I could never hate you, and I know you must care about me.
You do care, don't you?
Yes, I care.
Can't we go away and forget we ever said these things?
But how can we do that?
Don't you...?
Don't you want to marry me?
I'm going to marry Melanie.
But you can't!
Not if you care for me!
Oh, my dear, why must you make me say things that will hurt you?
How can I make you understand?
You're so young, you don't know what marriage means.
I know I love you, and I want to be your wife.
You don't love Melanie.
She's like me, Scarlett.
She's my blood and we understand each other.
But you love me!
How could I help loving you?
You have all the passion for life that I lack.
That kind of love isn't enough for two people as different as we are.
Why not say it, you coward?
You're afraid to marry me.
You'd marry that fool who can only say...
..."yes," "no" and raise a passel of mealy-mouthed brats!
You mustn't say that!
Who are you to tell me I mustn't?
You led me on!
- You made me believe you'd marry me.
- Scarlett, be fair!
- I never at any time...
- You did! It's true, you did!
I'll hate you till I die!
I can't think of anything bad enough to call you!
Has the war started?
Sir, you should have made your presence known.
In the middle of that beautiful love scene?
That wouldn't have been tactful, would it?
But don't worry.
Your secret is safe with me.
- Sir, you are no gentleman.
- And you, miss, are no lady.
I don't hold that against you.
Ladies never held any charm for me.
First you take advantage of me, then you insult me!
I meant it as a compliment.
I hope to see more of you, when you're free of the spell of Mr. Wilkes.
He doesn't strike me as good enough for a girl of your...
What was it?
Your "passion for living. "
How dare you!
You aren't fit to wipe his boots!
And you were going to hate him for the rest of your life.
She certainly made a fool of herself running after all the men.
That's not fair, India.
She's so attractive, men naturally flock to her.
Melanie, you're just too good to be true.
- Didn't you see her going after Charles?
- And she knows Charles belongs to me.
You're wrong, India.
Scarlett's just high-spirited and vivacious.
Men flirt with girls like that, but they don't marry them.
I think you're being very mean to her.
Miss O'Hara!
Mr. Lincoln's called volunteers to fight against us!
Don't you men think about anything important?
But it's war! Everybody's going off to enlist. I'm going too!
Everybody?
Miss O'Hara, will you be sorry?
To see us go?
I'll cry into my pillow every night.
Miss O'Hara, I told you I loved you.
You're the most beautiful girl in the world, and the sweetest, the dearest.
I couldn't hope that you could love me.
I'm so clumsy and stupid and not nearly good enough for you.
But if you could think of marrying me,
I'd do anything in the world for you.
Just anything, I promise.
What did you say?
Miss O'Hara, I said,
"Would you marry me?"
Yes, Mr. Hamilton, I will.
You will? You'll marry me?
You'll wait for me?
- I don't think I'd want to wait.
- You'll marry me before I go?
Oh, Miss O'Hara! Scarlett.
- When may I speak to your father?
- The sooner the better.
I'll go now, I can't wait.
Will you excuse me, dear?
Dear!
Mr. O'Hara! Mr. O'Hara!
- It'll be a week before they call me.
- A week till they take you away from me!
Oh, Ashley.
I thought of you at our wedding yesterday...
...and I hoped yours would be as beautiful.
- And it was!
- Was it?
Now we're really and truly sisters.
- Charles!
- Melanie.
Don't cry, darling.
The war will be over in a few weeks, and I'll be coming back to you.
Miss Scarlett!
I don't care!
I'm too young to be a widow.
Miss Scarlett!
Why, I'd just go around scaring people in that thing.
You shouldn't be around people.
You's in mourning!
For what? I don't feel anything.
Why should I have to pretend and pretend?
What is it?
Oh, poor baby!
What is it?
My life is over!
- Nothing will ever happen to me anymore!
- Darling...
Oh, Mother,
I know you think I'm horrible.
But I just can't bear going around in black.
It's bad enough not being able to go to parties. But looking this way too?
I don't think you're at all horrible.
It's only natural you want to look young and be young when you are young.
Oh, baby!
How would you like to visit somewhere?
Savannah, perhaps?
What would I do in Savannah?
Well, Atlanta then.
There's lots going on there.
And you can stay with Melanie and her Aunt Pittypat.
Melanie?
Yes.
Yes, I could, couldn't I?
Oh, Mother, you're sweeter than anybody in the world!
You'd like it, really?
All right, then.
Now stop your crying and smile.
You can take Prissy with you.
Start packing
Miss Scarlett's things, Mammy.
I'll go write the necessary letters.
Atlanta!
Savannah would be better for you.
You'll get in trouble in Atlanta.
What are you talking about?
You know what I's talking about.
I'm talking about Mr. Ashley Wilkes.
He'll come to Atlanta for his leave and you waiting for him just like a spider!
- He belongs to Miss Melanie...
- Go pack my things like Mother said!
They're all whispering, and I know it's about her!
What's it matter, Pittypat?
Scarlett's living under my roof, so they think I'm responsible for her.
And for a widow to appear in public at a social gathering...
...every time I think of it, I feel faint.
You know Scarlett came here only to help raise money for the Cause.
It was splendid of her to make the sacrifice.
Anyone hearing you talk would think she came to dance instead of sell things.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have important news! Glorious news!
Another triumph for our magnificent men in arms!
General Lee has completely whipped the enemy...
...and swept the Yankee army northward from Virginia!
And now, a happy surprise for all of us.
We have with us tonight, that most daring of all blockade runners...
...whose fleet schooners, slipping past the Yankee guns...
...have brought us here the very woolens and laces we wear tonight.
I refer, ladies and gentlemen, to that will-o'- the-wisp of the bounding main.
None other than our friend from Charleston...
...Captain Rhett Butler!
Permit me.
Captain Butler, such a pleasure to see you again.
I met you last at my husband's home.
That's kind of you to remember,
Mrs. Wilkes.
Did you meet Captain Butler at Twelve Oaks, Scarlett?
Yes, I... I think so.
Only for a moment.
It was in the library.
You had broken something.
Yes, Captain Butler, I remember you.
Ladies, the Confederacy asks for your jewelry on behalf of our noble Cause.
We aren't wearing any.
We're in mourning.
Wait.
On behalf of Mrs. Wilkes and Mrs. Hamilton.
Thank you, Captain Butler.
Just a moment, please.
But it's your wedding ring, ma'am.
It may help my husband more off my finger.
Thank you.
That was a very beautiful thing to do.
Here.
You can have mine too.
For the Cause.
And you, Mrs. Hamilton.
I know just how much that means to you.
Melanie?
- Dr. Meade?
- I need your approval...
...for something we want to do that's rather shocking.
Will you excuse us?
I'll say one thing. The war makes the most peculiar widows.
I wish you'd go away!
If you had any raising, you'd know
I'd never want to see you again!
Now, why be silly?
You've no reason for hating me.
I'll carry your guilty secret to my grave.
I'd be very unpatriotic to hate a great hero of the war.
I declare, I was surprised you turned out to be a noble character.
I can't bear to take advantage of your little-girl ideas.
I'm neither noble nor heroic.
- But you are a blockade runner?
- For profit, and profit only.
You don't believe in the Cause?
Rhett Butler is the only cause I know.
The rest doesn't mean much to me.
And now, ladies and gentlemen...
...I have a startling surprise for the benefit of the hospital.
Gentlemen, if you wish to lead the reel with the lady of your choice...
...you must bid for her!
Caroline Meade, how can you let your husband conduct this slave auction!
Darlene Merriwether, how dare you criticize me!
Melanie told the doctor that if it's for the Cause, it's quite all right.
She did?
Oh, dear! Oh, dear!
Where are my smelling salts?
- I think I shall faint.
- Don't you dare faint, Pittypat!
If Melanie says it's all right, it is all right.
Come, gentlemen, do I hear your bids? Make your offers!
Don't be bashful, gentlemen!
Twenty dollars! Twenty dollars for Miss Maybelle Merriwether!
Twenty-five dollars for Miss Fanny Elsing!
Only $25 to give your...
- One hundred and fifty dollars in gold.
- For what lady, sir?
For Mrs. Charles Hamilton.
- For whom, sir?
- Mrs. Charles Hamilton.
Mrs. Hamilton is in mourning.
But I'm sure any of our Atlanta belles would be proud to...
Dr. Meade, I said
Mrs. Charles Hamilton.
She will not consider it, sir.
Oh, yes, I will!
My goodness gracious!
Ooh! Ooh!
Choose your partners for the Virginia reel!
We've shocked the Confederacy.
It's like blockade running, isn't it?
It's worse. I expect a very fancy profit out of it.
I don't care what you expect.
I'm gonna dance and dance!
Tonight I wouldn't mind dancing with Abe Lincoln himself!
Another dance and my reputation will be lost forever.
With enough courage you can do without a reputation.
Oh, you do talk scandalous!
You do waltz divinely, Captain Butler.
Don't start flirting with me.
I'm not one of your plantation beaus.
I want more than flirting from you.
What do you want?
I'll tell you, Scarlett O'Hara, if you'll take that Southern belle simper off your face.
Someday I want you to say to me the words I heard you say to Ashley Wilkes.
"I love you. "
That's something you'll never hear from me as long as you live.
How sweet. How kind.
He is a thoughtful gentleman.
Why doesn't he say something about my sacrifice?
Oh. Oh!
Oh, the darling thing!
Oh, Rhett, it's lovely, lovely!
You didn't really bring it all the way from Paris just for me.
Yes, I thought it was about time
I got you out of that fake mourning.
Next trip I'll bring you some green silk for a frock to match it.
- Oh, Rhett.
- It's my duty to our...
...brave boys at the front to keep our girls at home looking pretty.
It's so long since I had anything new!
How do I look?
Awful! Just awful!
Why? What's the matter?
This war's stopped being a joke when a girl doesn't know the latest fashion.
Oh, Rhett! Let me do it.
But, Rhett, I don't know how I'd dare wear it!
You will, though.
And another thing, those pantalets!
I don't know a woman in Paris who wears pantalets anymore.
What do they...? You shouldn't talk about such things.
You don't mind my knowing about them, just my talking about them.
I can't go on accepting these gifts, though you're awfully kind.
I'm not kind. I'm tempting you.
I never give without expecting something in return. I always get paid.
I won't marry you to pay for the bonnet.
Don't flatter yourself.
I'm not a marrying man.
Well, I won't kiss you for it either.
Open your eyes and look at me.
No, I don't think I will kiss you.
Although you need kissing, badly.
That's what's wrong with you.
You should be kissed, and often.
And by someone who knows how.
And I suppose you think you're the proper person!
I might be, if the right moment ever came.
You're a conceited, black-hearted varmint!
I don't know why
I let you come and see me.
I'll tell you why, Scarlett.
I'm the only man over 16 and under 60 who's around to show you a good time.
But cheer up.
The war can't last much longer.
Really, Rhett? Why?
There's a battle going on now that ought to fix things...
...one way or the other.
- Oh, Rhett.
Is Ashley in it?
So you haven't gotten the wooden-headed
Mr. Wilkes out of your mind.
- Yes, I suppose he's in it.
- But tell me, where is it?
Some little town in Pennsylvania called Gettysburg.
Casualty lists! Casualty lists!
Please! Please!
Here you is. They was fighting for them so, it got tore in half.
Scarlett, you look.
The W's at the end.
Wellman, Wendel, White, Whitman,
Wilkens, Williams, Woolsey, Wortman...
Scarlett, you've passed him!
He isn't there! He isn't there!
Ashley's safe, he isn't listed!
Oh, he's safe. He's safe!
Scarlett, you're so sweet to worry about Ashley like this for me.
I must go to her.
Don't, my dear. Not here.
Let's go home.
Dr. Meade, not...?
Yes, our boy Darcy.
I was making these mittens for him.
He won't need them now.
Well, I'm gonna enlist.
I'll show them!
I'll kill those Yankees!
You hush your mouth.
You think it'll help your mother to have you shot too? It's silly!
It's a black day, Scarlett.
Haven't had bad news, have you?
- Ashley's safe.
- I'm glad, for Mrs. Wilkes' sake.
There are so many others.
- Any of your friends?
- About every family in the county.
- The Tarleton boys, both of them.
- Yes.
Look at them.
All these poor tragic people.
The South's sinking to its knees.
It'll never rise again.
The Cause.
The cause of living in the past is dying right in front of us.
I never heard you talk like that.
I'm angry. Waste always makes me angry and that's what this is, sheer waste!
But don't you be downcast.
Ashley's still alive to come home to the women who love him.
Both of them.
You're here!
Oh, you're here!
You're really here at last!
Oh, my dear, I've waited so long!
Melanie, my dear, my darling wife!
But we're forgetting Scarlett.
Scarlett, dear.
Why, is this any way to greet a returning warrior?
Ashley, I...
I...
Merry Christmas, Ashley.
Come on, old gentleman, come on.
We's ate all your wives.
We's ate all your little chicks.
You got nobody to worry your head about leaving.
Come on. Now you just stand still so you...
...can be Christmas for the white folks.
Now, hold on!
Hold on!
Don't go getting so uppity.
Even if you is the last chicken in Atlanta.
Let's not talk about the war.
Let's talk Twelve Oaks and Tara and times before there was a war.
Could we have the wine?
Why did you say there wasn't enough?
There's plenty. It's the very last of my father's fine Madeira.
He got it from his uncle
Admiral Will Hamilton of Savannah...
...who married his cousin
Jessica Carroll of Carrolton...
...who was his second cousin and akin to the Wilkeses too.
I saved it to wish Ashley a merry Christmas.
But you mustn't drink it all at once, because it is the last.
I meant it, my dear.
It was a lovely Christmas gift.
Only generals have tunics like this.
I'm so happy you like it.
Where did you get the cloth?
It was sent by a Charleston lady.
I nursed her son while he was in the hospital before he died and...
You will take good care of it, won't you?
You won't let it get torn.
Promise me.
You mustn't worry.
I'll bring it back to you without any holes in it. I promise.
Good night, my dear.
- Good night, Scarlett, darling.
Uncle Peter, is it time for Mr. Ashley to leave?
Pretty quick now, Miss Scarlett.
Melanie isn't going to the depot?
She hasn't changed her mind?
No, ma'am, she's laying down.
She's so upset, Mr. Wilkes told her she can't even come downstairs.
Ashley...
Ashley, let me go to the depot with you.
Scarlett, I'd rather remember you as you are now.
Not shivering at the depot.
All right.
Ashley, I've got a present for you too!
Why, Scarlett, it's beautiful!
Tie it on me, my dear.
While Melly was making a new tunic,
I made this to go with it.
You made it yourself?
Well, then I shall value it all the more.
You know there's nothing
I wouldn't do for you.
There's something you can do for me.
What is it?
Will you look after Melanie for me?
She's so frail and gentle, and she loves you so much.
- If I were killed...
- You mustn't say that! It's bad luck.
Say a prayer, quickly.
You say one for me.
We shall need all our prayers.
Now the end is coming.
- The end?
- The end of the war...
...and the end of our world, Scarlett.
But you don't think the Yankees are beating us?
Oh, Scarlett, my men are barefooted now!
And the snow in Virginia's deep.
When I see them, and I see the Yankees coming and coming...
...always more and more!
When the end does come,
I shall be far away.
It'll be a comfort to me to know that she has you.
You will promise, won't you?
Yes.
Is that all, Ashley?
All except... goodbye.
Oh, Ashley, I can't let you go!
- You must be brave. You must!
- No, no!
How else can I bear going?
Oh, Scarlett! You're so fine and strong and beautiful.
Not just your sweet face, my dear...
...but you.
Ashley, kiss me. Kiss me goodbye.
Ashley.
No, Scarlett. No!
- Oh, Ashley, I love you.
I've always loved you.
I've never loved anyone else.
I only married Charles just to hurt you.
Ashley, tell me you love me.
I'll live on it the rest of my life!
Goodbye.
When the war's over, Ashley.
When the war's over.
- And there's a place back home...
...where a wild plum tree comes to flower in the springtime...
...down by the creek, you know.
Yes, I know, I know.
When we were little, my brother Jeff and I used to...
I told you about my brother Jeff, didn't I, ma'am?
I know I did. He...
We don't know where Jeff is now, ma'am.
Since Bull Run, we haven't heard anything and...
Please, we must have your temperature now.
Just take this in your mouth and not talk anymore. Not just now.
Melanie, I'm so tired.
I've got to go home.
Aren't you tired, Melanie?
No, I'm not tired, Scarlett.
This might be Ashley...
...and only strangers here to comfort him.
No, I'm not tired, Scarlett.
They could all be...
...Ashley.
I've been waiting one solid hour to speak to you, Mrs. Wilkes.
Go on, you trash.
Don't you be pestering these ladies.
- Don't talk to her.
- It's all right. Who are you?
My name's Belle Watling.
But that don't matter.
You think I got no business here.
Tell me what you want to see me about.
First time I come here, I says,
"Belle, you're a nurse. "
They didn't want my kind of nursing.
They was more than likely right.
Then I tried giving them money.
My money wasn't good enough either!
The old peahens!
I know a gentleman who says you're a human being.
If you are, which they ain't, you'll take my money for the hospital.
What are you doing here?
Haven't you been told twice already?
This time I'm conversing with Mrs. Wilkes!
You might as well take my money.
It's good money, even if it is mine.
- I'm sure you're very generous.
- I'm a Confederate, like everybody else.
Of course you are!
Some folks here wouldn't feel that way.
But maybe they ain't as good Christians as you.
Look, Mrs. Meade, it's a great deal of money.
Ten, 20, 30, 50!
And it's not our paper money, it's gold!
Let me see that handkerchief. R.B.!
And she's driving away in Rhett Butler's carriage!
Oh, if I just wasn't a lady, what wouldn't I tell that varmint!
"The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want.
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures.
He restoreth my soul.
He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for His name's sake.
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death...
...I will fear no evil, for Thou art with me.
Thy rod and Thy staff, they comfort me. "
The Yankees!
Yankees! Oh, Dr. Meade, they're getting closer.
They'll never get into Atlanta.
Never get through old Peg Leg Hood.
Give me something for the pain!
Give me something for the pain!
Sorry, son, we haven't got anything to give you.
These animals is driving me crazy!
What luck! You got my jack.
Give me an ace and I'll start another war.
And I'll bid the moon.
- That I never see you and my Pa again.
This leg's got to come off.
No, don't! Leave me alone!
I'm sorry, soldier.
- We're all out of chloroform.
- We'll operate without it.
No, no, you won't!
You can't do it.
I won't let you do it!
Tell Dr. Wilson to take this leg off.
It's gangrene.
No! Oh!
I haven't seen my family in three days.
I'm going home for half an hour.
Orderly, give me a lift!
Nurse, you can free this bed.
Miss Scarlett!
Why, Frank Kennedy.
Miss Suellen. Is she well?
When did they bring you in?
Are you bad hurt?
- Suellen. Is she...?
- She's all right.
Dr. Wilson needs you in the operating room.
He's gonna take off that leg.
Better hurry.
I'll be back.
No! You leave me alone! Don't!
I can't stand it! No, don't!
Don't cut! Don't cut!
Don't! Don't! Please!
Where's the nurse?
Dr. Wilson's waiting.
Let him wait! I'm going home!
I've done enough!
I don't want any more men dying and screaming. I don't want any more!
Big Sam!
Big Sam! Big Sam!
Almighty Moses!
It's Miss Scarlett!
Big Sam! Big Sam.
Sam, Elijah, Prophet, Apostle.
I'm so glad to see you.
Tell me about Tara, about my mother.
She didn't write me.
- She gone got sick.
- Sick?
Just a little bit sick, that's all.
Your pa went wild when they wouldn't let him fight.
He had fits when they took us to dig the ditch for the soldiers.
Your ma said the Confederacy needs it.
We's digging for the South.
- Was there a doctor?
We've got to march.
Don't worry, we'll stop them Yankees.
Goodbye, Big Sam. Goodbye, boys.
If you get sick or hurt, let me know.
- Goodbye, Miss Scarlett. Goodbye.
Goodbye. Goodbye.
Scarlett! Scarlett!
Climb into this buggy. This is no day for walking. You'll get run over!
Oh, Rhett.
Drive me to Aunt Pitty's, please.
Panic's a pretty sight, isn't it?
Just another of Sherman's calling cards. He'll pay us a visit soon.
I gotta get out of here before the Yankees come!
Leave your work at the hospital?
Or have you had enough of death and lice and men chopped up?
I suppose you weren't meant for sick men.
Don't talk like that. I'm so scared!
I wish I could get out of here.
Let's get out together.
No use letting the South come down around your ears.
There are too many nice places to go and visit.
- Mexico, London, Paris...
- With you?
Yes, ma'am.
With a man who understands and admires you for what you are.
I figure we belong together, being the same sort.
I've been waiting for you to grow up and get Ashley out of your heart.
Well, I hear Mrs. Wilkes is going to have a baby in another month or so.
It'll be hard loving a man with a wife and baby clinging to him.
Well, here we are. Are you going with me or are you getting out?
I hate and despise you, Rhett Butler.
I'll hate and despise you till I die!
Oh, no, you won't, Scarlett.
Not that long.
Miss Scarlett! Miss Scarlett!
Folks is all going to Macon, and folks is running away!
I can't bear those cannonballs right in my ears!
I faint every time I hear one.
Uncle Peter, look out for that trunk.
- You aren't leaving?
- I may be a coward...
...but oh, dear! Yankees in Georgia!
How did they ever get in?
I'm going too.
Prissy, go pack my things.
Wait, I won't be a minute.
- Do you really think you ought to?
Scarlett!
What is this?
You ain't planning on running away?
Don't try to stop me.
I'm never going back to that hospital.
I've had enough of smelling death, of rot and death.
I'm going home! I want my mother.
My mother needs me.
Listen to me! You must stay here.
Without a chaperon?
It simply isn't...
Good heavens, this is war, not a garden party!
- Melanie needs you.
- Oh, bother Melanie!
She's ill already. She shouldn't even be having a baby.
Can't we take her along?
Want her to be jounced over rough roads and have the baby ahead of time?
It isn't my baby.
You take care of her!
We haven't enough doctors to look after a sick woman.
You've got to stay.
What for? I don't know anything about babies being born.
I knows! I knows!
I knows how to do it.
I's done it lots and lots.
Let me, doctor. Let me.
- I can do everything.
- Good. I'll rely on you to help us.
Ashley's fighting in the field.
Fighting for the Cause.
He may never come back.
He may die.
Scarlett, we owe him a well-born child.
Ashley.
If you're coming, Scarlett, hurry!
I promised Ashley something...
Then you'll stay?
Good. Go along, Miss Pittypat.
Scarlett's staying.
Go on, Uncle Peter.
I don't know what to do.
It's like the end of the world!
Uncle Peter, my smelling salt!
Melanie, Melanie!
It's all your fault!
I hate you! I hate you!
And I hate your baby!
If only I hadn't promised Ashley.
If only I hadn't promised him!
Stop! Stop! Stop! Please, stop.
Are the Yankees coming?
The army's pulling out.
Pulling out and leaving us to the Yankees?
Not leaving, evacuating. Before
Sherman cuts the McDonough road.
It can't be true!
What'll I do?
Better refugee south, right quick.
If you'll excuse me.
Prissy!
Prissy! Go pack my things and
Melanie's too. We're going to Tara.
The Yankees are coming!
Scarlett! Scarlett!
Melly, we're going to...
Melly...
I'm sorry to be such a bother, Scarlett.
It began at daybreak.
But... But...
But the Yankees are coming.
Poor Scarlett.
You'd be at Tara now with your mother, wouldn't you?
If it weren't for me.
Oh, Scarlett, darling.
You've been so good to me.
No sister could have been sweeter.
I've been lying here thinking...
...if I should die...
...will you take my baby?
Fiddle-dee-dee, Melly.
Aren't things bad enough without you talking about dying?
- I'll send for Dr. Meade.
- Not yet, Scarlett.
I couldn't let Dr. Meade sit here for hours...
...while all those poor, wounded boys...
Prissy! Prissy, Prissy!
Come here, quick!
Go get Dr. Meade. Run! Quick!
The baby.
Don't stand there like a scared goat. Run!
Hurry, hurry!
I'll sell you south, I will.
I swear I will!
Where's that Prissy?
This room's like an oven already and it isn't noon yet.
Don't worry, Melly.
Mother says it always seems like the doctor will never come.
If I don't take a strap to that Prissy!
Oh, Melly...
Know what I heard about Maybelle Merriwether?
You remember that funny-looking beau of hers?
The one with the uniform like ladies' red flannels?
You don't have to keep on talking for my sake.
I know how worried you are.
For to tote the weary load
No matter, 'twill never...
Oh, Melly...
I'll just go and fetch you some cooler water.
You're slow as molasses in January.
Where's Dr. Meade?
- I never seen him, Miss Scarlett.
- What?
He ain't at the hospital.
A man told me that the doctor's down at the car shed...
...with the wounded soldiers...
Well, why didn't you go after him?
Miss Scarlett, I's scared to go down there at the car shed.
There's folks dying down there.
And I's scared of dead folks!
Go sit by Miss Melly.
And don't you be upsetting her or I'll whip the hide off you.
Just a few more days
For to tote the weary load
Have you seen...?
Move aside, lady, please.
Dr. Meade?
Dr. Meade.
Dr. Meade, at last!
Thank heaven you're here.
I need every pair of hands.
Now, come, child, wake up.
We got work to do.
But Melly's having her baby.
You've got to come with me!
Are you crazy? I can't leave these men for a baby.
They're dying! Hundreds!
Get a woman to help.
But there isn't anybody.
Dr. Meade, she might die.
Die? Look at them, bleeding to death in front of my eyes!
No chloroform. No bandages.
Nothing!
Nothing to ease their pain.
Run along and don't bother me.
Don't worry, child.
There's nothing to bringing a baby.
- Bring the stretchers in here.
Dr. Meade?
Yeah, I'm coming.
Is the doctor come?
No, he can't come.
Oh, Miss Scarlett,
Miss Melly bad off.
He can't come.
There's nobody to come.
You've got to manage without the doctor. I'll help you.
Oh, Lordy, Miss Scarlett!
Well, what is it?
Lordy, we's got to have a doctor!
I don't know nothing about birthing babies!
- What do you mean?
- I don't know...
You told me you knew everything!
I don't know why I lied!
Ma ain't never let me around when folks was having them.
Scarlett! Scarlett!
Miss Scarlett!
Stop it!
Go light a fire on the stove.
Boil water in the kettle.
Get me a ball of twine, clean towels and the scissors.
Don't tell me you can't find them!
Go get them and get them quick!
Scarlett! Scarlett!
- Scarlett!
- Coming, Melly.
Coming!
You better go before the Yankees get here.
You know I won't leave you.
It's no use. I'm gonna die.
Don't be a goose, Melly.
Hold on to me.
- Hold on to me!
- Talk to me, Scarlett.
Please, talk to me.
Don't try to be brave. Yell!
There's nobody to hear.
Ma says if you puts a knife under the bed, it cuts the pain.
Captain Butler!
Captain Butler! Captain Butler!
- Who do you want?
- Captain Butler.
He's upstairs.
Belle Watling's giving a party.
Yes, sir. Thank you.
Captain Butler! Oh, Captain Butler!
What's all the rumpus about?
I's got a message for Captain Butler, Mrs. Watling.
Captain Butler, you come out here in the streets to me!
- What is it, Prissy?
- Miss Scarlett done sent me for you.
Miss Melly, she done had her baby today.
A fine baby boy.
And Miss Scarlett and me, we brung it.
Are you telling me Scarlett...?
It was mostly me, Captain Butler.
Only Miss Scarlett, she helped me a little.
But I don't expect no doctor could have done no better.
Only, Miss Melly, she feel kind of poorly now it's all over.
Yes, I can believe that.
And the Yankees is coming.
And Miss Scarlett, she says...
Captain Butler, the Yankees is here!
Please come and bring your carriage for us right away!
I'm sorry, but the army took my horse and carriage.
You better come upstairs.
I'll see what I can do.
Oh, no, Captain Butler.
Ma would wear me out with a cornstalk if I was to go into Mrs. Watling's.
Any of you beauties know where
I can steal a horse for a good cause?
Is that you, Rhett?
We's here, Miss Scarlett!
I knew you'd come.
Nice weather we're having.
Prissy tells me you're...
If you make any jokes now,
I'll kill you!
- Don't tell me you're frightened?
- I'm scared to death!
If you had sense, you'd be scared too.
- Oh, the Yankees!
- No, not yet.
That's what's left of our army blowing up the ammunition.
We gotta get out of here!
At your service.
Where are you going?
- Home, to Tara.
- They've been fighting around Tara.
You're going to parade through there with a sick woman, a baby and a darkie?
Do you intend leaving them?
They're going with me, and you can't stop me!
It's dangerous jouncing
Mrs. Wilkes over open country.
I want my mother!
I want to go home to Tara!
Tara's probably been burned.
The woods are full of stragglers.
The least they'll do is take the horse.
It's not much, but I had trouble stealing it.
I'm going home if I have to walk every step of the way!
I'll kill you if you try to stop me! I will, I will!
I will, I will!
Shh, shh, shh.
All right, darling, all right.
Now you shall go home.
I guess anybody who did what you've done today can take care of Sherman.
Stop crying.
Now blow your nose like a good little girl. There.
What're you doing?
- I'm packing!
Well, stop it and come and get the baby!
Melly?
- Melly?
Mrs. Wilkes?
- We're taking you to Tara.
- Tara?
It's the only way, Melly.
They'll burn the house over our heads if we stay.
It's all right, Melly.
My baby.
My poor baby.
- Can you put your arms around my neck?
- I think so.
Never mind.
Ashley, Charles!
What's she want?
Ashley's picture and Charles' sword.
Get them.
What's that?
Our gallant lads set fire to the warehouses.
Enough ammunition in boxcars to blow us to Tara.
- We have to get across the tracks.
- Not that way!
We have to. McDonough road's the only one the Yankees haven't cut yet.
Wait, I forgot to lock the front door!
- What are you laughing at?
- At you, locking the Yankees out.
Oh, dear!
I wish they'd hurry.
I wouldn't be in such a hurry to see them go.
With them goes the last semblance of law and order.
Scavengers aren't wasting any time.
Better get out of here fast.
There's a horse! Get it!
Give us that horse!
Down the alley! Cut him off!
Pull that horse!
I'll get him!
Give me that horse!
Oh, Miss Scarlett!
Haven't left much to take.
We'll make a dash for it before the fire reaches that ammunition.
Come on!
Throw me your shawl.
You'll like it better if you don't see anything.
Come on!
Take a good look, my dear.
It's a historic moment.
Tell your grandchildren how you watched the Old South disappear one night.
They were gonna lick the Yankees in a month. The poor gallant fools.
They make me sick.
Getting us all into this by swaggering and boasting.
That's the way I felt once about their "swaggering and boasting. "
I'm so glad you aren't with the army.
You can be proud. Proud that you've been smarter than all of them.
I'm not so proud.
Why did you stop?
This is the turn to Tara.
Let the horse breathe a bit.
Mrs. Wilkes.
Miss Melly done fainted way back, Captain Butler.
She's better off. She couldn't stand the pain if she were conscious.
Scarlett, are you still determined to do this crazy thing?
Oh, yes, yes.
I know we can get through, Rhett.
Not we, my dear, you.
I'm leaving you here.
You're what?
Rhett, where are you going?
- I'm going to join the army.
- You're joking.
- I could kill you for scaring me so.
- I'm very serious, Scarlett.
I'm going to join up with our brave lads in gray.
But they're running away.
They'll turn and make a last stand.
When they do, I'll be with them.
- I'm a little late, but better late...
- You must be joking!
Selfish to the end, aren't you?
Thinking of your own hide, never a thought for the Cause.
How could you do this to me?
And why should you go now that it's all over, and I need you?
- Why? Why?
- Why?
I've always had a weakness for lost causes, once they're really lost.
Or maybe...
Maybe I'm ashamed of myself.
Who knows?
You should die of shame to leave me alone and helpless!
You? Helpless?
Heaven help the Yankees if they capture you.
Now climb down here.
- I want to say goodbye.
- No!
Climb down!
Rhett, please don't go!
You can't leave me, please.
I'll never forgive you!
I'm not asking you to forgive me.
I'll never forgive myself.
If a bullet gets me, I'll laugh at myself for being an idiot.
There's one thing I do know, and that is I love you, Scarlett.
In spite of you and me and the world going to pieces, I love you.
Because we're alike.
Bad lots, both of us.
Selfish and shrewd, but able to look things in the eye and call them by name.
Don't hold me like that!
Scarlett...
Look at me.
I love you more than
I've ever loved any woman.
And I've waited longer for you than any woman.
Let me alone!
A soldier of the South loves you.
Wants your arms around him.
Wants to carry the memory of your kisses into battle.
Never mind about loving me.
You're a woman sending a soldier to his death with a beautiful memory.
Scarlett, kiss me.
Kiss me once.
You low-down, cowardly, nasty thing, you!
They were right. Everybody was right.
You aren't a gentleman.
A minor point at such a moment.
Here. If anyone lays a hand on that nag, shoot him.
But don't make a mistake and shoot the nag.
Go on! I want you to go.
I hope a cannonball blows you into a million pieces...!
Never mind the rest.
I follow your general idea.
And when I'm dead on the altar of my country, I hope your conscience irks you.
Goodbye, Scarlett.
Come on, you. We're going home.
Oh, my poor baby.
Don't worry. Mother will take care of him when we get home.
Miss Scarlett, I's powerful hungry.
- We's got to have something to eat.
- Hush up!
We're nearly at Twelve Oaks.
We'll stop there.
Go on!
Oh, Ashley.
Ashley, I'm glad you're not here to see this.
The Yankees. The dirty Yankees!
Prissy! Come tie up this cow.
We don't need no cow, Miss Scarlett.
We'll be home soon, and I's scared of cows.
Tie her onto the back of the wagon with your petticoat.
We need milk for the baby, and we don't know what we'll find at home.
Melly, we're home!
We're at Tara.
Hurry! Move, you brute!
Miss Scarlett, it's dead!
I can't see the house. Is it there?
I can't see the house.
Have they burned it?
It's all right! It's all right!
They haven't burned it.
It's still there!
Mother! Mother, I'm home!
Mother, let me in. It's me. Scarlett!
Oh, Pa!
I'm home.
Katie?
Katie Scarlett!
Oh, darlin'!
Mammy!
Mammy, I'm home.
Honey child...
Mammy, I'm so...
Where's Mother?
Why...
...Miss Suellen, Miss Carreen, they was sick with the typhoid.
They had it bad, but they's doing all right now.
- Just weak, like little kittens.
- But where's Mother?
Well...
Miss Ellen. She went down to nurse that Emmie Slattery...
...that white trash, and she took down with it too.
Then last night, she...
Mother?
Miss Scarlett, honey.
If there's anything I can do,
Miss Scarlett...
- What did you do with Melly?
- Don't worry your pretty head.
I done slapped her in bed, along with the baby.
You better put that cow into the barn.
There ain't no barn no more.
- Yankees burned it for firewood.
This was their headquarters.
They camped all around.
Yankees in Tara?
Yes'm, and they stole most everything they didn't burn.
All the clothes and all the rugs, and even Miss Ellen's rosaries.
I'm starving.
Get me something to eat.
There ain't nothing to eat, honey. They took it all.
All the chickens? Everything?
They took them first.
What they didn't eat, they carried off.
Don't tell me any more about what "they" did!
What's this, Pa?
- Whiskey?
- Yes, daughter.
Katie Scarlett, that's enough.
Your not knowing spirits, you'll make yourself tipsy.
I hope it makes me drunk.
I'd like to be drunk.
Oh, Pa...
What are those papers?
Bonds.
They're all we've saved, all we have left.
Bonds.
But what kind of bonds, Pa?
Why, Confederate bonds, of course.
Confederate bonds.
What good are they to anybody?
I'll not have you talking like that.
Oh, Pa, what are we going to do with no money...
...and nothing to eat?
We must ask your mother.
That's it.
We must ask Mrs. O'Hara.
- Ask Mother?
- Yes.
Mrs. O'Hara will know what's to be done.
Now don't be bothering me.
Go out for a ride.
I'm busy.
Oh, Pa...
Don't worry about anything.
Katie Scarlett's home.
You needn't worry.
What'll we do with nothing to feed those sick folks and that child?
I don't know, Mammy.
I don't know.
We ain't got nothing but radishes in the garden.
Miss Scarlett,
Miss Suellen and Miss Carreen...
...they's fussing to be sponged off.
- Where are the other servants?
- Only just me and Pork left.
The others went to war or runned away.
I can't take care of that baby and sick folkses too!
I's only got two hands.
Who's gonna milk that cow,
Miss Scarlett? We's houseworkers.
As God is my witness...
As God is my witness, they're not going to lick me.
I'm going to live through this, and when it's all over...
...I'll never be hungry again.
No, nor any of my folk.
If I have to lie, steal, cheat, or kill...
...as God is my witness,
I'll never be hungry again!
My back's near broken.
Look at my hands!
Mother said you could always tell a lady by her hands.
I guess things like hands and ladies don't matter so much anymore.
Rest, Sue. You're not well yet.
I can pick cotton for both of us.
Scarlett's hateful!
Making us work in the fields...
Too bad about that.
Get back to work. I can't do everything at Tara myself.
What do I care about Tara?
I hate Tara!
Don't you ever dare say you hate Tara again!
It's the same as hating Pa and Ma.
There's something
I must speak to you about.
What is it?
I don't like the way you're treating Prissy and Mammy.
You must be firm with inferiors, but gentle with them. Especially darkies.
I know. But I'm not asking them to do what I don't do myself.
Nevertheless, I don't like it.
I shall speak to Mrs. O'Hara about it.
- What are you doing out of bed?
- I must talk to you.
You're all working so hard.
I can't just lie in bed.
Go upstairs.
You're as weak as a newborn colt.
- Please, let me.
- Stop being noble.
I don't need you making yourself sick so you'll never be any use.
Oh, I didn't think of it that way.
Who's there?
Halt or I'll shoot!
You all alone, little lady?
You ain't very friendly, are you?
You got anything else besides these earbobs?
You Yankees have been here before.
Regular little spitfire, ain't you?
What do you got hidden in your hand?
Scarlett, you killed him.
I'm glad you killed him.
Scarlett, what happened?
What is it, Scarlett? What is it?
Don't be scared!
Your sister was cleaning a revolver and it went off and scared her.
Thank goodness!
We got enough to frighten us.
Tell Katie Scarlett she must be more careful.
What a cool liar you are, Melly.
We gotta get him out of here and bury him.
If the Yankees find him here...
I didn't see anyone else.
I think he must be a deserter.
Even so, we've gotta hide him.
They might hear about it, and then they'd come and get you.
I could bury him in the arbor where the ground is soft...
...but how will I get him out of here?
- We'll both take a leg and drag him.
- You couldn't drag a cat.
Scarlett...
Would it be dishonest if we went through his haversack?
I'm ashamed I didn't think of that myself.
You take the haversack.
I'll search his pockets.
You look. I'm feeling a little weak.
I think it's full of money.
Melly, look. Just look!
Ten, 20, 30...
Don't stop to count it now.
We haven't got time!
Do you realize this means we can eat?
Look in his other pockets.
Hurry, hurry!
We've got to get him out of here.
If he bleeds across the yard, we can't hide it.
Give me your nightgown.
I'll wad it round his head.
Don't be silly, I won't look at you.
If I had on pantalets, I'd use them.
Thank heavens I'm not that modest.
Now go back to bed.
You'll be dead if you don't.
I'll clean up my mess when I've buried him.
No, I'll clean it up.
Well, I guess I've done murder.
I won't think about that now.
I'll think about that tomorrow.
Katie Scarlett!
It's over! It's over!
It's all over, the war.
Lee surrendered!
- It's not possible.
- Why did we ever fight?
Ashley will be coming home.
Yes, Ashley will be coming home.
We'll plant more cotton.
Cotton ought to go sky-high next year.
The flag that makes you free
So we sing the chorus
From Atlanta to the sea
While we were marching through Georgia
Get out of the road, rebel!
Have you room for a dying man?
Not for any Southern scum, alive or dead. Get out of the way!
I reckon he'd rather try and walk it, at that.
Jump, you gray-backed beggars!
Acts like they won the war.
You come on, give me them pants, Mr. Kennedy.
Come on!
Scrub yourself with that lye soap,
'fore I scrub you myself.
I'm gonna put these britches in the boiling pot.
The whole army's got the same troubles...
...crawling clothes and dysentery.
It's humiliating how you're treating him.
You'd be a sight more humiliated if Mr. Kennedy's lice gets on you.
Oh, come on, Beau!
We must leave this gentleman alone because he's tired and he's hungry.
I don't mind, ma'am.
Good to see a youngster again.
Nice little fella.
Another two years, and we could've had him in Cobb's Legion.
- Were you in Cobb's Legion?
Yes, ma'am.
Why, then, you must know my husband, Major Wilkes?
Oh, yes, ma'am. He was captured at Spotsylvania, I think.
Captured? Oh, thank heaven!
Then he isn't...
- My poor Ashley, in a Yankee prison.
Melanie?
Yes, Scarlett, I'm coming.
Come along, Beau.
I'll watch out for him.
We're good friends.
Thank you.
I slave day and night just so we can have enough food...
...and you give it away to scarecrows.
- I'd sooner have a plague of locusts.
- Don't scold me, Scarlett.
I've just heard that Ashley was taken prisoner.
- Ashley a prisoner?
- Yes.
And maybe if he's alive and well, he's on some Northern road right now.
Maybe a Northern woman is giving him some of her dinner...
...and helping my beloved to come back home to me.
- I hope so, Melly.
Miss Scarlett?
I want to take up something with your Pa, but he doesn't seem to...
Perhaps I can help you.
I'm head of the house now.
Well, I... I...
Miss Scarlett, I was aiming to ask for Suellen.
Are you telling me you haven't asked for her after all these years?
The truth is, I'm so much older than she is...
...and now I haven't a cent to my name.
Who has, nowadays?
Miss Scarlett, if true love carries any weight with you...
...you can be sure your sister will be rich in that.
I'd go and get myself a little business, if we're engaged.
- As soon as I'm on my feet again...
- All right, Frank.
I'm sure I can speak for Pa.
You go ask her now.
Thank you.
Thank you, Miss Scarlett.
Excuse me, Mrs. Wilkes.
Excuse me.
What seems to be the trouble with Mr. Kennedy?
More trouble than he guesses.
He's finally asked for Suellen's hand.
Oh, I'm so glad.
It's a pity he can't marry her now.
It'd be one less mouth to feed.
Oh, another one!
- Hope this one isn't hungry.
- He'll be hungry.
I'll tell Prissy to get an extra plate...
Ashley!
Miss Scarlett!
Don't spoil it.
Turn me loose, you fool.
Turn me loose! It's Ashley!
He's her husband, ain't he?
- Miss Scarlett?
- High time you got back.
- Did you get the horse shod?
- Yes'm, he's shod.
Fine thing, horses get shoes and humans can't.
Here, stir this soap.
Miss Scarlett, ma'am?
I gotta know how much money have you got left. In gold.
Ten dollars. Why?
That won't be enough.
What are you talking about?
Well, I see'd that old no-count white-trash Wilkerson...
...that used to be
Mr. Gerald's overseer here.
He's a regular Yankee now, and he was making a brag...
...that his Carpetbagger friends run the taxes way up sky-high on Tara.
- How much more we got to pay?
- I hear the taxman say $300.
Three hundred...!
It might just as well be 3 million.
But we gotta raise it, that's all.
Yes'm. How?
- I'll go ask Mr. Ashley.
- He ain't got no $300.
Well, I can ask him if I want to, can't I?
Asking ain't getting.
Ashley...
They say Abe Lincoln got his start splitting rails.
Just think what heights I may climb to, once I get the knack.
Ashley, the Yankees want $300 more in taxes.
What shall we do?
Ashley, what's to become of us?
What becomes of people when their civilization breaks up?
Those with brains and courage come through all right.
Those that haven't are winnowed out.
For heaven's sake...
...don't talk nonsense when it's us being winnowed out!
You're right, Scarlett. Here I am talking tommyrot about civilization...
...while your Tara is in danger.
You've come to me for help, and I've none to give.
Oh, Scarlett, I'm a coward.
You, Ashley? A coward?
What are you afraid of?
Mostly of life becoming too real for me, I suppose.
Not that I mind splitting rails.
But I do mind very much losing the beauty of that life I loved.
If the war hadn't come, I'd have spent my life happily buried at Twelve Oaks.
But the war did come.
I saw my boyhood friends blown to bits.
I saw men crumple up in agony when I shot them.
And now I find myself in a world which for me is worse than death.
A world in which there's no place for me.
I can't make you understand.
You don't know the meaning of fear.
You never mind facing realities.
You never want to escape from them as I do.
Escape?
Ashley, you're wrong.
I do want to escape too.
I'm so very tired of it all.
I've struggled for food and for money.
I've weeded, hoed and picked cotton till I can't stand it.
I tell you, the South is dead.
It's dead!
The Yankees and Carpetbaggers have it and left nothing for us.
Oh, Ashley...
Let's run away.
We'd go to Mexico.
They want officers in the Mexican army.
We'd be happy.
I'd work for you.
I'd do anything for you!
You don't love Melanie. You said you loved me at Twelve Oaks.
And anyway, Melanie can't...
Dr. Meade said she can't have more children. I could give you...
Can't we ever forget Twelve Oaks?
You think I could ever forget?
Have you?
Can you honestly say you don't love me?
- No, I don't love you.
- It's a lie!
Even so, do you think
I'd leave Melanie and the baby?
You couldn't leave your father and the girls.
I'm sick of them.
I'm tired of them!
Yes, you're sick and tired.
That's why you're talking this way.
You've carried the load for all of us.
From now on, I'll be more help to you. I promise.
There's only one way you can help me.
Take me away.
There's nothing to keep us here.
Nothing?
Nothing except honor.
Please, Scarlett.
Please, dear. You mustn't cry.
You mustn't. Please, my brave dear, you mustn't.
You do love me! You do love me!
- No, don't, don't.
- You love me.
We won't do this.
I tell you, we won't do it!
It won't happen again.
I'll take Melanie and go.
- Say it. You love me.
- All right, I'll say it.
I love your courage and stubbornness so much that I could forget...
...the best wife a man ever had.
But I'm not going to forget her!
Then there's nothing left for me.
Nothing to fight for.
Nothing to live for.
Yes, there is something.
Something you love better than me...
...though you may not know it.
Tara.
Yes.
I still have this.
You needn't go.
I won't have you all starve, simply because I threw myself at your head.
It won't happen again.
It's Emmie Slattery.
- Yes'm, it's me.
Stop!
You haven't forgotten your old overseer, have you?
Emmie's Mrs. Wilkerson now.
Get off those steps, you wench!
Get off this land!
You can't speak that way to my wife.
Wife? High time you made her your wife.
Who baptized your brats after you killed my mother?
We came out here to pay a call.
A friendly call, and talk business with old friends.
Friends? When were we ever friends?
Still high and mighty, ain't you?
Well, I know all about you.
Your father's turned idiot.
You can't pay your taxes, and I come to offer to buy the place from you.
To make you a right good offer.
Emmie wants to live here.
Get off this place, you dirty Yankee!
You'll see who's running things when you're sold out for taxes.
I'll buy this place and I'll live in it!
But I'll wait for the sheriff's sale.
That's all of Tara you'll ever get!
You'll be sorry for that.
We'll be back!
I'll show you who the owner of Tara is!
Pa, come back!
Pa, come back!
Yankee coward!
Pa!
Lordy, Miss Scarlett, that's Mr. Gerald's watch!
You take it. It's for you.
Pa'd want you to have it.
You ain't got no business parting from this watch now.
You needs all your valuables to sell for that tax money.
Do you think I'd sell Pa's watch?
And don't cry.
I can stand everybody's tears but yours.
Oh, Mammy, Mammy!
You've been brave so long.
You just gotta go on being brave.
- Think about your Pa like he used to be.
- I can't think about Pa.
I can't think of anything but that $300.
Ain't no good thinking about that.
Ain't nobody got that much money.
Nobody but Yankees and Scalawags got that much money now.
Rhett.
Who that? A Yankee?
Oh, Mammy, I'm so thin and pale...
...and I haven't any clothes.
Go and get Ma's old box of dress patterns.
- What you up to?
- You'll make me a new dress.
Not with Miss Ellen's portières!
Great balls of fire!
They're my portières now.
I'm going to Atlanta for $300, and I've got to look like a queen.
- Who's going with you?
- I'll go alone.
That's what you think!
I's going with you and that new dress.
- Mammy, darling.
- No use to try to sweet talk me.
I knows you since I put diapers on you.
I said I's going with you, and going I is!
Kings in trade, eh?
Too good for me, major.
It's a pity the war wasn't a poker game.
You'd done better than Grant, with far less effort.
What is it?
There's a lady to see Captain Butler.
Says she's his sister.
Another sister?
This is a jail not a harem, captain.
No, she ain't one of those.
She's got her mammy with her.
She has?
I'd like to see this one, major.
Without her mammy.
Let's see, my losses for the afternoon come to what?
Three hundred and forty?
My debts do mount up, don't they, major?
All right, corporal, show Captain
Butler's "sister" to his cell.
Thank you, major.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
It's hard to be strict with a man who loses money so pleasantly.
- Rhett!
- Scarlett!
My dear little sister!
It's all right, corporal. My sister has brought me no files or saws.
Can I really kiss you?
On the forehead, like a good brother.
No, thanks. I'll wait and hope for better things.
I was so distressed when
I heard you were in jail.
I couldn't sleep for thinking.
It's not true they'll hang you?
Would you be sorry?
- Oh, Rhett.
- Well, don't worry yet.
They trumped up a charge, but they really want my money.
They think I made off with the Confederate treasury.
- Well, did you?
- What a leading question.
Let's not talk about things like money.
How good of you to come and see me.
And how pretty you look!
How you do run on, teasing a country girl like me.
Thank heavens you're not in rags.
I'm tired of women in rags. Turn around.
You look good enough to eat, and prosperous.
I've been doing very well.
Everyone's well at Tara, only...
...I got so bored, I thought
I'd treat myself to a visit to town.
You're heartless, but that's part of your charm.
You've got more charm than the law allows.
I didn't come to talk silliness about me.
I was so miserable at the thought of you in trouble.
I was mad at you when you left me on the road to Tara.
- And I still haven't forgiven you.
- Don't say that.
Well, I must admit I might not be alive now, only for you.
When I think of myself with anything I could possibly hope for...
...not a care in the world, and you here in this horrid jail.
And not even a human jail,
Rhett, a horse jail!
Listen to me trying to make jokes...
...when I really want to cry.
In a minute I shall cry.
Scarlett...
Can it be possible that...?
Can what be possible, Rhett?
That you've grown a woman's heart?
A real woman's heart.
I have, Rhett. I know I have.
It's worth being in jail just to hear you say that.
It's well worth it.
You can drop the moonlight and magnolia.
Things have been going well at Tara?
What've you done with your hands?
- I went riding without my gloves...
- You've been working like a field hand!
Why did you lie, and what are you up to?
- I almost believed you cared.
- But I do care!
Let's get down to the truth.
You want something enough...
...to put on quite a show in your velvets.
What is it? Money?
I want $300 to pay the taxes on Tara.
I lied when I said everything was all right.
Things are as bad as they possibly could be. And you've got millions.
What collateral do you have?
- My earbobs.
- Not interested.
- Mortgage on Tara.
- What would I do with a farm?
- I'd pay you out of next year's cotton.
- Not good enough.
You once said you loved me.
If you still love me...
You haven't forgotten,
I'm not a marrying man.
No, I haven't forgotten.
You're not worth $300.
You'll never mean anything but misery to any man.
I don't care what you say, only give me the money.
I won't let Tara go! I can't while there's a breath left in my body.
Oh, Rhett, won't you please give me the money?
I couldn't if I wanted to.
My funds are in Liverpool, not Atlanta.
If I drew a draft, they'd be on me like a duck on a June bug.
So you see, my dear, you've abased yourself to no purpose.
Here, here. Stop it! You want the Yankees to see you like this?
Take your hands off me, you skunk!
You knew what I wanted.
You knew you wouldn't lend me the money and you let me go on!
I enjoyed hearing what you had to say. Cheer up.
Come to my hanging,
I'll put you in my will.
I'll come to your hanging!
I'm just afraid they won't hang you in time to pay the taxes on Tara!
Tell him Belle Watling.
Where you been? I thought you deserted Captain Butler.
I keep myself occupied.
Help me out.
Who that? I ain't never see'd hair that color before in my life.
You know a dyed-haired woman?
Wish I knew that one.
She'd get my money for me.
Whatever they done to you in there...
...they didn't do no more than you deserve for visiting white trash.
Fresh and green.
Right off the farm.
What you doing tonight, Susie?
That's a Georgia peach!
Nothing like that in Ohio.
You know what we'll do?
What?
We're gonna give every one of you
40 acres and a mule.
And a mule?
- Forty acres and a mule!
Gee!
- Because we're your friend.
And you're gonna become voters and vote like your friends do!
What's your hurry?
What's come over this town?
Yankees have come over it.
Same as they've come over all of them.
Out of our way, trash!
Get out of the way here!
Get away! Go on.
It can't be Miss Scarlett!
Frank Kennedy!
And Mammy.
It's good to see home folks.
I didn't know you were here.
I didn't know you were.
Didn't Suellen tell you about my store?
Did she? I don't remember.
Have you a store?
- This?
- Won't you come in, look around a bit?
I don't suppose it looks like much to a lady...
...but I can't help being proud of it.
- You're not making money?
- Well, I can't complain.
In fact, I'm mighty encouraged.
Folks tell me
I'm just a born merchant.
Won't be long before
Miss Suellen and I can marry.
- Are you doing as well as all that?
- Yes, I am.
I'm no millionaire yet...
...but I've cleared $1000 already.
And lumber too.
- That's only a sideline.
- A sideline, Frank?
With all the good Georgia pine around Atlanta, and all this building?
Well, all that takes money,
Miss Scarlett...
...and I gotta think about buying a home.
Why would you want a home?
For Suellen to set up housekeeping.
Here in Atlanta.
You'd want to bring her to Atlanta.
There wouldn't be much help in that for Tara.
I don't know what you mean.
I don't mean a thing.
How'd you like to drive me to my Aunt Pitty's?
Nothing'd give me more pleasure.
You better stay to supper.
Aunt Pitty'd be agreeable, and I'd like a long visit.
You act on me just like a tonic,
Miss Scarlett.
And will you tell me all the news...
...of Miss Suellen?
What's the matter?
Miss Suellen's not ill, is she?
Oh, no, no. I thought surely she had written you.
I guess she was ashamed to write you.
She should be ashamed.
How awful to have such a mean sister.
You must tell me.
Don't leave me on tenterhooks.
Well, she's going to marry one of the county boys next month.
She got tired of waiting, was afraid she'd be an old maid and...
Oh, I'm sorry to be the one to tell you.
It's cold, and I left my muff at home.
Would you mind if I put my hand in your pocket?
But, Melanie, you don't realize what she's done!
She's gone and married my Mr. Kennedy!
He's my beau and she's married him!
- She did it to save Tara.
- I hate Tara!
I hate Scarlett! She's the only thing I hate worse than Tara!
It's all my fault.
I should've committed robbery to get that tax money for you.
I couldn't let you do anything like that.
Anyway, it's done now.
Yes, it's done now.
You won't let me do anything dishonorable...
...yet you'd sell yourself in marriage to a man you didn't love.
You won't have to worry about my helplessness anymore.
What do you mean?
I'm going to New York.
I've arranged for a position in a bank.
But you can't do that.
I counted on you to help me start a lumber business and...
I counted on you.
I don't know anything about the lumber business.
You know as much as you do about banking...
...and I'd give you half the business.
That's generous of you, Scarlett.
But it isn't that.
If I go to Atlanta and take help from you again...
...I'd bury any hope of ever standing alone.
Oh, is that all?
You could gradually buy the business, and then it would be your own and...
No, Scarlett.
Oh! Ashley!
Ashley!
Scarlett?
Scarlett, what is it?
Ashley's so mean and hateful!
What have you done?
She wanted me to go to Atlanta.
To help me start my lumber business.
And he won't help me!
How unchivalrous of you.
Why, think, Ashley, think!
If it hadn't been for Scarlett,
I'd have died in Atlanta...
...and maybe we wouldn't have little Beau.
When I think of her picking cotton and plowing...
...just to keep food in our mouths,
I could just...
Oh, my darling.
All right, Melanie.
I'll go to Atlanta.
I can't fight you both.
Come on, lift them feet!
There's your new mill hands,
Mrs. Kennedy.
The pick of all the best jails in Georgia.
They look thin and weak.
Halt!
They're the best you can lease.
If you'll give Johnnie Gallegher a free hand...
...you'll get what you want out of them.
All right, you're the foreman.
Just keep the mill running and deliver my lumber when I want it.
Johnnie Gallegher's your man, miss. But remember...
...no questions and no interference.
That's a bargain.
Start in the morning.
Come on, get a move on there!
But this isn't right, and you know it.
Bad enough to be a businesswoman...
Why do you complain?
You wouldn't own a mill if I didn't take over.
But I didn't want the mill.
We couldn't buy it if you hadn't pressed our friends for their debts.
Isn't that right, Ashley?
Are you running a charitable institution?
Go back to the store, and go home and take your medicine.
Sugar, don't you think...?
Great balls of fire! Don't bother me.
And don't call me "sugar. "
All right. All right.
Good night, Ashley.
My, my!
She can get mad quicker than any woman I ever saw.
I don't like to interfere...
...but I wish you'd let me hire darkies and not use convicts.
We could do better.
Darkies' pay would break us.
Convicts are cheap.
If we give Gallegher a free hand...
A free hand? That means he'll starve and whip them.
Didn't you see them?
Some are sick.
How you do run on.
If I let you alone, you'd give them chicken...
...and tuck them in with quilts.
I won't make money out of the enforced labor and misery of others.
You didn't mind owning slaves.
That was different.
We didn't treat them that way.
I'd have freed them when father died...
...if the war hadn't already freed them.
Oh, I'm sorry, Ashley.
Do you forget what it's like without money?
Money is the most important thing in the world.
I don't intend to be without it again.
I'll make enough the only way I know how so the Yankees can't take Tara.
We're not the only Southerners who've suffered.
Look at all our friends. They're keeping their honor and kindness.
And they're starving. I've no use for fools who won't help themselves.
I know what they say about me.
I don't care.
I'll befriend Carpetbaggers and beat them at their own game.
And you'll beat them with me.
That's it. Pull it a little over to that side.
- Afternoon, Mrs. Kennedy.
- Good afternoon.
- Business is certainly growing.
- It certainly is.
You're doing business with the people...
...who robbed us, tortured us and left us to starve.
All that's past.
I intend to make the best of things, even if they are Yankee things.
And do you know that Dr. Meade actually saw her...
...peddling lumber to Yankees herself?
- That isn't all.
It's shocking what she's doing to my brother.
She's even taken to driving her own buggy.
My dear Mrs. Kennedy.
My very dear Mrs. Kennedy!
I don't see how you have the gall to face me!
You could've had my millions if you'd just waited a while.
Oh, how fickle is woman!
What is it you want?
I have things to do.
Will you satisfy my curiosity on a point which has always bothered me?
Well, what is it?
Tell me, do you never shrink from marrying men you don't love?
How'd you get out ofjail?
Why didn't they hang you?
Oh, that! There's nothing much that money won't buy.
I observe it's even bought you the honorable Mr. Wilkes.
So you still hate Ashley Wilkes.
I believe you're jealous of him.
You still think you're the belle of the county, the cutest trick in shoe leather.
- That every man is in love with you.
- Let me by.
Don't be angry.
Tell me, where are you going?
- I'm going out to the mill.
- Through Shantytown alone?
It's dangerous to drive alone through all that riffraff.
Don't worry about me.
I can shoot straight, if I don't have to shoot too far.
What a woman!
Give me a quarter.
Let go of my horse!
Hold this horse.
- Let go!
- Give me that gun.
Help! Help!
Help!
Miss Scarlett!
Wait!
Miss Scarlett, wait!
Miss Scarlett! Miss Scarlett!
It's Sam!
- Big Sam?
Miss Scarlett, wait!
Sam! Sam!
Is you hurt, Miss Scarlett?
Did they hurt you?
Don't you cry. Big Sam will get you out of this in a jiffy.
Horse, make tracks!
Get to Tara as quick as you can and stay there.
I will. I's had enough of them Carpetbaggers.
Thank you, Mr. Frank.
Goodbye, Miss Scarlett.
Goodbye, Sam. Thank you.
Change your dress and go over to Miss Melly's.
I've got to go to a political meeting.
How can you go to a political meeting after what I've been through?
Oh, sugar.
You're more scared than hurt.
Nobody cares about me.
You all act as though it were nothing at all.
The men talk about protecting our women...
...and then after what happened to me,
Frank went to a political meeting.
And if it won't pain you too much,
India Wilkes...
...tell me why you're staring at me.
Has my face gone green?
It won't pain me.
What happened today was just what you deserved.
With any justice, you'd have gotten worse.
India, hush up.
- Let her talk. She's always hated me.
Ever since I took Charles away, though she won't admit it.
If she thought anybody'd notice, she'd walk the street naked.
I do hate you!
You've done all you could to lower the prestige of decent people.
Now you've endangered the lives of our men...
...because they've got to...
India!
We'd better not say any more, or one of us will be saying too much.
What's going on that I don't know about?
Shh!
Somebody's coming up the walk.
Somebody that ain't Mr. Ashley.
Will you hand me the pistol,
Mrs. Meade?
Whoever it is...
...we know nothing.
Where have they gone?
Tell me. It's life or death.
Don't tell him.
He's a Yankee spy.
Quickly. There may be time.
- How'd you know?
- I played poker with Yankees.
They knew there'd be trouble.
They sent the cavalry out.
Your men are walking into a trap.
Don't tell him.
He's trying to trap you.
Out the Decatur road.
The old Sullivan plantation.
They're meeting in the cellar.
I'll do what I can.
What's this about?
If you don't tell me, I'll go crazy.
We thought it best not to tell you.
The men have gone to clean out the woods where you were attacked.
It's what many of our Southern men have had to do to protect us.
And if they're captured, they'll be hanged. And it will be your fault.
Another word and you leave, India.
Scarlett did what she had to do.
Our men are doing what they think they have to do.
Frank...
...and Ashley.
Oh, it isn't possible.
There's horses, Miss Melly.
Here they come.
We're sewing, we're sewing!
Open the door.
Good evening, Mrs. Kennedy.
Who is Mrs. Wilkes?
I am Mrs. Wilkes.
- I should like to speak to Mr. Wilkes.
- He's not here.
- Are you sure?
- Don't you doubt Miss Melly's word!
I meant no disrespect, Mrs. Wilkes.
If you give me your word,
I won't search the house.
Mr. Wilkes is at a political meeting at Mr. Kennedy's store.
He's not at the store. There's no meeting tonight, no political meeting.
We'll wait outside till he and his friends return.
Surround the house.
Put a man on each door and window.
Keep on with your sewing, ladies.
And I'll read aloud.
"The Personal History and Experience of David Copperfield.
Chapter One.
I am born.
To begin my life with the beginning of my life, I record that I was born... "
"Chapter Nine.
I have a memorable birthday.
I pass over all that happened at school...
...until the anniversary of my birthday came round in March.
Except that Steerforth was more to be admired than ever, I remember nothing.
He was going away at the end of the half-year...
...if not sooner, and was more spirited and independent than before.
But beyond this,
I remember nothing.
The great... "
"I remember nothing. "
Melly, they're drunk!
Leave this to me, Scarlett.
And, please, say nothing.
- You stupid fool!
- Shh!
Quiet!
Will you shut up, for the love of...
Hello, Melly.
So you've got my husband intoxicated again. Well, bring him in.
I'm sorry, your husband's under arrest.
If you arrest all the drunks in Atlanta, you must arrest a good many Yankees.
Bring him in, Captain Butler, if you can walk yourself.
- Wait.
- I wanna tell you a story.
Listen, doctor, I...
Put him down in that chair.
Now, captain, please leave my house...
...and try to remember not to come here again.
That's fine thanks I get for bringing him home...
...and not leaving him in this shameful condition.
Now, boys, all together...
Dr. Meade!
I'm astonished at you!
Oh, Ashley!
How can you do this to me?
I ain't so very drunk, Melly.
Take him to the bedroom.
Lay him out on the bed.
- Don't touch him. He's under arrest.
- Now, Tom.
What do you want to arrest him for?
I've seen him drunker.
I've seen you drunker.
And you've seen me...
He can lie in the gutter for all I care.
I'm not a policeman.
He led a raid on that Shantytown where Mrs. Kennedy got into trouble.
A lot of shanties were burned.
A couple of men were killed.
It's time you rebels learned you can't take the law into your own hands.
What are you laughing at?
This isn't your night to teach that lesson.
These two have been with me tonight. Yes, sir.
With you, Rhett?
Where?
I don't like to say in the presence of ladies.
You'd better say.
Come out on the porch and I'll tell you.
Speak out. I think I have a right to know where my husband's been.
Well, ma'am...
...we dropped in on a friend of mine...
...and the captain's.
A Mrs. Belle Watling.
We played cards and drank champagne, and, well...
Now you've done it. Did you have to show me up in front of my wife?
Now, I hope you're satisfied.
These ladies won't be speaking with their husbands.
Well, Rhett, I had no idea.
Look here, will you take an oath that they were with you tonight at Belle's?
Ask Belle if you don't believe me.
She'll tell you.
Will you give me your word, as a gentleman?
As a gentleman?
Why, certainly, Tom.
Well, if I've made a mistake,
I'm sorry.
I hope you'll forgive me, Mrs. Wilkes.
If you'll leave us in peace.
Well, I say I'm sorry.
Well, I am sorry.
Come on, sergeant.
Lock that door. Pull down the shades.
- Oh!
- Ashley!
He's all right.
It's only in the shoulder.
Get him on the bed where I can dress the wound.
I think I can walk.
It's not worth the effort.
Which way?
In here.
Mammy, I want hot water.
And lint for bandages.
What can I use for a probe?
If I only had my bag.
Were you really there?
What did it look like?
Does she have cut-glass chandeliers, plush curtains and dozens of mirrors?
Good heavens, Mrs. Meade, remember yourself.
Captain Butler, tell me what happened, all that happened.
I was too late.
When I got to the Sullivan place, there had already been a skirmish.
I found Mr. Wilkes wounded, and Dr. Meade was with him.
I had to prove they'd been somewhere, anyplace but where they were.
- So I took them to Belle's.
- And she took them in?
She's by way of being an old friend of mine.
Oh, I'm sorry...
I'm sorry I couldn't think up a more dignified alibi.
This isn't the first time you've come between me and disaster.
It isn't likely that I'd question any device of yours.
And now I'll go and see what Dr. Meade needs.
Oh, Ashley...
Ashley...
Have you no interest in what's become of your own husband?
Did Frank go with you to Belle Watling's?
No.
Well, where is he?
He's lying out on Decatur Road...
...shot through the head.
He's dead.
Who is it?
It's Mrs. Watling.
Oh, Mrs. Watling.
Won't you come in the house?
Oh, no, I couldn't do that,
Mrs. Wilkes.
You come in and sit a minute with me.
How can I thank you enough for what you did for us?
I got your note saying you would call on me and thank me.
Why, Mrs. Wilkes, you must have lost your mind.
I came as soon as it was dark to say you mustn't think of any such thing.
Why, I'm...
Well, you're...
It wouldn't be fitting at all.
It wouldn't be fitting for me to thank a woman who saved my husband's life?
Mrs. Wilkes, there ain't never been a lady nice to me like you was.
I mean, about the money for the hospital.
I don't forget a kindness.
I thought about you being widowed with a little boy...
...if Mr. Wilkes got hung.
He's a nice little boy, your boy is, Mrs. Wilkes.
I got a boy myself, so I...
You have? Does he live...?
Oh, no, he ain't here in Atlanta.
He ain't never been here.
He's off at school.
I ain't seen him since he was little.
Anyways, if it had been that
Mrs. Kennedy's husband by hisself...
...I wouldn't have lifted a finger, no matter what Rhett said.
She's a mighty cold woman...
...prancing about Atlanta by herself.
She killed her husband same as if she shot him.
You mustn't say unkind things about my sister-in-law.
Oh.
Please don't freeze me, Mrs. Wilkes.
I forgot how you liked her.
She just ain't in the same class with you, and I can't help it if I think so.
Well, anyways, I gotta be going.
I'm scared somebody'll recognize this carriage if I stay any longer.
That wouldn't do you no good.
And, Mrs. Wilkes, if you ever see me on the street...
...you don't have to speak to me.
I'll understand.
I should be proud to speak to you.
Proud to be under obligation to you.
I hope we meet again.
Oh, no. That wouldn't be fitting.
- Good night, Mrs. Wilkes.
- Good night, Mrs. Watling.
And you're wrong about Mrs. Kennedy.
She's brokenhearted about her husband.
Great balls of fire!
It's Rhett.
Captain Butler's here.
I told him you was prostrate with grief.
Tell him I'll be right down, Mammy.
She says she's coming.
I don't know why she's coming, but she's coming.
You don't like me, Mammy.
Don't you argue with me.
You don't. You really don't.
It's no good, Scarlett.
- What?
- The cologne.
I don't know what you mean.
I mean you've been drinking.
Brandy. Quite a lot.
Well, what if I have?
Is that any of your affair?
Don't drink alone.
People always find out, and it ruins a reputation.
What is it?
This is more than losing old Frank.
Oh, Rhett, I'm so afraid.
I don't believe it.
You've never been afraid.
I'm afraid now.
I'm afraid of dying and going to hell.
You look pretty healthy.
And maybe there isn't any hell.
Oh, there is. I know there is.
I was raised on it.
Far be it from me to question the teachings of childhood.
Tell me what you've done that hell yawns before you.
I ought never to have married Frank.
He was Suellen's beau, and he loved her, not me.
And I made him miserable, and I killed him.
Yes, I did. I killed him.
Rhett, for the first time...
...I'm finding out what it is to be sorry for something I've done.
Here. Dry your eyes.
If you had it all to do over again, you'd do no differently.
You're like the thief who isn't sorry he stole...
...but he's terribly sorry he's going to jail.
I'm glad Mother's dead.
I'm glad she's dead so she can't see me.
I always wanted to be like her, calm and kind...
...and sadly, I've turned out disappointing.
You know, Scarlett, I think you're on the verge of a crying jag.
So I'll change the subject and say what I came to say.
Say it, then, and get out!
- What is it?
- I can't go on any longer without you.
Oh! You really are the most ill-bred man to come here at a time...
I made up my mind you were the only woman for me...
...the first day I saw you.
Now you have a mill and Frank's money...
...and won't come to me as you did to the jail.
- So I see I shall have to marry you.
- I never heard of such bad taste.
Would you be convinced if I fell to my knees?
Turn me loose and get out.
Forgive me for startling you with my impetuous sentiments...
...my dear Scarlett...
I mean, my dear Mrs. Kennedy.
But you must have noticed that for some time...
...the friendship I've felt for you has ripened into a deeper feeling.
A feeling more beautiful, more pure, more sacred...
Dare I name it? Can it be love?
Get up off your knees.
I don't like your common jokes.
This is an honorable proposal of marriage...
...made at what I consider a most opportune moment.
I can't go all my life waiting to catch you between husbands.
You're coarse and you're conceited.
And I think this conversation's gone far enough.
Besides, I shall never marry again.
Oh, yes, you will.
And you'll marry me.
You? You?
I don't love you.
And I don't like being married.
Ever think of marrying just for fun?
Marriage, fun?
Fiddle-dee-dee!
Fun for men, you mean.
Do you want them to hear you?
You've been married to a boy and an old man.
Why not try a husband of the right age, with a way with women?
You're a fool, Rhett Butler...
...when you know I shall always love another man.
Stop it. You hear me? Stop it.
No more of that talk.
Don't. I shall faint.
I want you to faint.
This is what you're meant for.
None of those fools have kissed you like this.
Your Charles or your Frank or your stupid Ashley.
Say you're going to marry me.
Say yes. Say yes.
Yes.
Are you sure you meant it?
You don't want to take it back?
No.
Look at me, and try to tell me the truth.
Did you say yes because of my money?
Well, yes, partly.
Partly?
Well, you know, Rhett, money does help.
- And, of course, I am fond of you.
- Fond of me?
If I said I was madly in love with you, you'd know I was lying.
- You say we have a lot in common...
- Yes, you're right, my dear.
I'm not in love any more than you are.
Heaven help the man who ever really loves you.
What kind of ring would you like?
A diamond ring, and do buy a great big one.
You'll have the biggest and most vulgar ring in Atlanta.
I'll take you to New Orleans for the most expensive honeymoon.
- That'd be heavenly.
- I'll buy your trousseau for you too.
How wonderful...
...but you won't tell anybody, will you?
Still the little hypocrite.
Won't you kiss me goodbye?
You've had enough kissing for one afternoon.
You're impossible. You can go.
I don't care if you never come back.
But I will come back.
What are you thinking about, Scarlett?
I'm thinking about how rich we are.
I can keep the lumber business too?
Yes, of course you can, if it amuses you.
Now that you're so rich, you can tell everybody to go to the devil.
But you were the main one
I wanted to go to the devil.
Don't scrape the plate.
I'm sure there's more in the kitchen.
Oh, Rhett, can I have a chocolate one stuffed with meringue?
If you don't stop being a glutton, you'll get as fat as Mammy.
And I'll divorce you.
It'd be nice if you bought something for Mammy.
Why should I buy her a present when she called us both mules?
Mules? Why mules?
She said we could give ourselves air and get slicked up like racehorses...
...but we were just mules in horse harness and we didn't fool anybody.
I never heard anything more true.
Mammy's a smart old soul.
And one of the few people I know whose respect I'd like to have.
- I won't give her a thing.
- Then I'll take her a petticoat.
My mammy said when she went to heaven...
...she wanted a red taffeta petticoat so stiff that it'd stand by itself...
...and so rustley the Lord would say it's made of angels' wings.
She won't take it from you.
She'd rather die than wear it.
That may be. But I'm making the gesture just the same.
Wake up. Wake up!
You were having another nightmare.
Oh, Rhett.
Rhett, I was so cold and hungry and so tired.
I couldn't find it. I ran through the mist and I couldn't find it.
- Find what, honey?
- I don't know.
I always dream the same dream, and I never know.
It seems to be hidden in the mist.
Darling...
Oh, Rhett, do you think I'll ever dream that I found it, and that I'm safe?
Dreams don't work that way.
But when you get used to being safe and warm...
...you'll stop dreaming that dream.
And, Scarlett, I'm going to see that you are safe.
Rhett, would you do something for me if I asked you?
You know I would.
Will you take me away from here?
- Don't you like New Orleans?
- I love New Orleans...
...but I want to go home and visit Tara.
Will you take me to Tara?
Yes, Scarlett. Of course I will.
We'll go tomorrow.
You get your strength from this red earth of Tara.
You're part of it and it's part of you.
I'd give anything to have Tara the way it was before the war.
Would you?
Go ahead and make it that way.
Spend whatever you want.
Make it as fine a plantation as it ever was.
Oh, Rhett!
Rhett, you are good to me.
Can we still have our big new house in Atlanta?
Yes. And it can be as ornate as you want.
Marble terraces, stained-glass windows.
Won't everyone be jealous!
I want everybody who's been mean to me to be pea-green with envy.
I don't care. Scarlett's hateful...
...building that new house just to show off!
And even taking our servants!
Oh, darling, you mustn't think unkindly of her.
She's made it possible for us to keep Tara, always.
Yes, and what good is Tara?
She's had three husbands, and I'll be an old maid!
Great Jehoshaphat!
Great Jehoshaphat!
Lordy, we sure is rich now.
That's ridiculous!
Why can't I go in?
I'm entitled to at least see what my own child looks like.
You control yourself.
You'll be seeing it for a long time.
I'd like to apologize about its not being a boy.
Oh, hush your mouth.
Who wants a boy?
Boys aren't any use.
Don't you think I'm proof of that?
Have a drink of sherry.
Mammy, she is beautiful, isn't she?
She sure is.
You ever see a prettier one?
Miss Scarlett was mighty near that pretty when she come, but not quite.
Have another glass.
Mammy?
What's that rustling noise I hear?
Lordy, that ain't nothing but my red silk petticoat you done give me.
Nothing but your petticoat?
I don't believe it. Pull up your skirt.
Mr. Rhett, you is bad.
Yea, Lordy!
You sure took a long enough time about wearing it.
Yes, sir. Too long.
No more mule in horse's harness?
Mister Rhett, Miss Scarlett was bad telling you about that.
You ain't holding that against old Mammy, is you?
I don't hold it against you.
I just wanted to know.
Have another glass.
Here, take the whole bottle.
Dr. Meade says you can go in now,
Captain Butler.
This sure is a happy day to me.
I done diapered three generations of this family's girls.
And it sure is a happy day.
Oh, yes, Mammy. The happiest days are when babies come. I wish...
Oh, Mammy, she's beautiful.
What do you suppose they'll name her?
Miss Scarlett done told me if it was a girl...
...she was going to name it
Eugenia Victoria.
Yes, she's a beautiful baby.
The most beautiful baby ever.
Yes...
Do you know that this is your birthday?
That you're a week old today?
Yes, I'm going to buy her a pony, the likes of which...
...this town has never seen.
Yes, I'm going to send her to the best schools in Charleston.
Yes, and her will be received by the best families in the South.
And when it comes time for her to marry...
...well, she'll be a little princess.
Certainly making a fool of yourself.
Why shouldn't I?
She's the first person who's ever completely belonged to me.
Great balls of fire!
I had the baby, didn't I?
It's Melanie. May I come in?
- Come in.
Yes, come in and look at my daughter's beautiful blue eyes.
Most babies have blue eyes when they're born.
Don't tell him anything.
He knows everything about babies.
Nevertheless, her eyes are blue and they'll stay blue.
As blue as the Bonnie Blue flag.
That's it.
That's what we'll call her.
"Bonnie Blue Butler. "
Try again, Mammy.
Twenty inches.
Twenty inches.
I've grown as big as Aunt Pitty.
You simply gotta make it 181/2 again.
You done had a baby.
And you ain't never gonna be no 181/2 inches again.
There ain't nothing to do about it.
There is something to do about it.
I'm just not going to get old and fat before my time.
I just won't have any more babies.
I heard Mr. Rhett say that he'd be wanting a son next year.
Tell Captain Butler I decided not to go out.
I'll have supper in my room.
I got your message.
I'll have them bring my supper up here too.
No objections to that, I hope?
No.
Yes. Uh...
I mean, I don't care where you have your supper.
Rhett...
Yes?
- You see...
Well, I've decided...
Well, I hope I don't have any more children.
My pet, as I told you before Bonnie was born...
...it's immaterial to me whether you have one child or 20.
No, but you know what I...
Do you know what I mean?
I do. And do you know
I can divorce you for this?
You're low enough to think of that.
If you had any chivalry in you, or were nice...
Look at Ashley Wilkes. Melanie can't have any more children and he...
You've been to the lumber office this afternoon.
What has that got to do with it?
Quite the little gentleman, Ashley.
Pray, go on, Mrs. Butler.
It's no use. You wouldn't understand.
- You know, I'm sorry for you, Scarlett.
- Sorry for me?
Yes, sorry for you because you throw away happiness with both hands...
...and reach out for something that'll never make you happy.
I don't know what you're talking about.
If you were free and Melly were dead and you had your precious Ashley...
...do you think you'd be happy?
You'd never know him, never even understand his mind...
...any more than you understand anything, except money.
Never mind about that. I want...
You may keep your sanctity.
It'll work no hardship on me.
You don't care?
The world is full of many things and people...
...and I shan't be lonely.
I will find comfort elsewhere.
Well, that's fine.
But I warn you, in case you change your mind, I intend to lock my door.
Why bother?
If I wanted to come in, no lock could keep me out.
I knew most women were cheats...
...hypocritical and hard, but this one...
- It ain't no use.
- What do you mean?
I mean you're poisoned with her.
I don't care what she's done to you.
You're still in love with her.
- It pleasures me none to say it.
- Maybe so, but I'm through with her.
You've gotta think of the child.
Child's worth 10 of the mother.
You're a shrewd woman, Belle.
And a very nice one.
Yes, Rhett?
I was just thinking of the difference between you and...
You're both hardheaded businesswomen, and successful.
But you've got a heart, Belle.
And you're honest.
Goodbye, Rhett.
Goodbye, Belle.
She'll be a wonderful horsewoman.
Look at those hands. And that seat!
Oh, fiddle-dee-dee!
Why we have to wheel a baby when we have servants...
- Good morning, Mrs. Merriwether.
Captain Butler.
Good morning, Scarlett.
Making fools of ourselves in front of these buffaloes.
If you'd thought of your position, you wouldn't have to.
But as it is, we're going to cultivate every female dragon of the Old Guard...
- Good morning, Mrs. Whiting.
Captain Butler.
Good morning, Scarlett.
So the millionaire speculator is turning respectable.
Money can't buy what I want for Bonnie.
I'll admit I've been at fault too.
Bonnie will have a place among decent people.
Even if we both have to crawl on our bellies to every fat old cat...
Good morning, Mrs. Meade.
Good morning, Captain
Butler. Good morning, Scarlett.
Mrs. Merriwether, I have great regard for your knowledge.
- Could you give me some advice?
- Why, certainly.
My Bonnie sucks her thumb.
I can't stop her.
You should make her stop!
It'll ruin the shape of her mouth.
I know, I know.
She has such a beautiful mouth too.
- I tried putting soap on her nails.
Soap? Bah!
Put quinine on her thumb and she'll stop sucking it quick enough.
Quinine! I never would have thought of it.
I can't thank you enough.
You've taken a great load off my mind.
Good morning.
Good morning, Dolly.
Wasn't that Captain Butler?
Good morning, Caroline.
I was just thinking...
...there's a great deal of good in a man who would love a child so much.
But of course there is.
Fanny Elsing told Dr. Meade that
Captain Butler finally admitted...
...that he was honored for his services at the Battle of Franklin.
No, and did I tell you that Captain Butler made...
...a stupendous contribution to the
Association for the Beautification...
...of the Graves of the Glorious Dead?
- No!
My grandbaby, Napoleon Picard, is giving a party for Bonnie next week.
Why, Dolly Merriwether, it was my idea to give a party for Bonnie.
Why, Caroline Meade, how can you say a thing like that?
Watch Daddy put your pony over it, Bonnie. Now, watch!
Daddy, let me! Let me!
All right, darling.
Put her on, Pork.
Up we go!
Oh, there!
Lordy mercy!
There he goes again.
Grip tightly with your legs.
Lean forward and go with him.
Hold your reins properly in a firm hand. Up!
That was fine. I knew you'd do it.
When you're older,
I'll take you to Kentucky and Virginia.
You'll be the best horsewoman in the South. Give your daddy a kiss.
Mr. Rhett? Mr. Rhett!
Mr. Rhett!
Did you see her?
Wasn't she wonderful?
Mr. Rhett, I done told you and told you...
...it just ain't fittin' for a girl to ride astraddle with her dress flying up.
All right. I'll teach her to ride sidesaddle.
And I'll buy her a blue velvet riding habit. She'll love that.
A nice black broadcloth is what little girls wear.
Oh, now, Mammy, be reasonable.
Well, I don't think it's fittin', but...
It ain't fittin', it just ain't fittin'.
It ain't fittin'.
Why, Scarlett, what are you doing downtown at this time of day?
Well, Ashley, I just...
Why aren't you helping Melly with my surprise birthday party?
Why, Ashley Wilkes, you aren't supposed to know anything about that.
Melly'd be so disappointed if you weren't surprised.
I won't let on.
I'll be the most surprised man in Atlanta.
As long as you're here, let me show you the books...
...so you can see how bad a businessman I am.
Don't let's fool with any books today.
When I'm wearing a new bonnet...
...all the figures I ever knew go right out of my head.
Figures are well lost when the bonnet's as pretty as that.
Scarlett, you know, you get prettier all the time.
You haven't changed a bit since our last barbecue at Twelve Oaks...
...where you sat under a tree surrounded by dozens of beaus.
That girl doesn't exist anymore.
Nothing's turned out as I expected,
Ashley. Nothing.
Yes, we've traveled a long road since the old days, haven't we?
Oh, the lazy days...
...the warm, still, country twilight...
...the high, soft Negro laughter from the quarters...
...the golden warmth and security of those days.
Don't look back, Ashley.
Don't look back.
It drags at your heart till...
...you can't do anything but look back.
I didn't mean to make you sad, my dear.
I never want you to be anything but completely happy.
Oh, Ashley!
- Who is it?
Only your husband.
Come in.
Am I actually being invited into the sanctuary?
You're not ready for Melanie's party.
I've got a headache, Rhett.
You go without me and make my excuses to Melanie.
What a white-livered little coward you are!
Get up! You're going to that party and you'll have to hurry.
- Has India dared...?
- Yes, India has.
- Everyone in town knows the story.
- Kill them for spreading lies.
I don't kill people who tell the truth.
No time to argue.
I won't go! I can't go until this misunderstanding clears up.
You won't cheat Melly out of publicly ordering you out of her house.
There was nothing wrong.
India hates me so. I can't go.
If you don't show your face tonight, you'll never be able to again.
I don't care, but you won't ruin
Bonnie's chances.
You're going to that party, for her sake. Get dressed.
Wear that. Nothing modest or matronly will do for this occasion.
And put on plenty of rouge.
I want you to look your part tonight.
For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
Which nobody can deny
- Good night, Scarlett.
- But, Rhett...
You're going into the arena alone.
The lions are hungry.
Don't leave me. Don't.
You're not afraid?
What a lovely dress, darling.
India wasn't able to come.
Will you be an angel?
I do need you to help me receive my guests.
Mrs. Meade...
...here's our darling Scarlett.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
- Why, Scarlett.
- Good evening.
Ashley, aren't you going to get our Scarlett a glass of punch?
Did you have a good time at Miss Melly's party?
Yes. Now, Mammy, be sure and leave word.
If Captain Butler asks for me when he comes back, I'm asleep.
Yes'm.
Come in, Mrs. Butler.
Come here.
Sit down.
No reason you shouldn't have a nightcap, even if I am here.
I didn't want a drink.
I heard a noise...
You heard nothing of the kind.
You wouldn't have come if you thought I was here.
- You must need a drink badly.
- I do not.
Take it. Don't give yourself airs.
I know you drink on the quiet, and I know how much you drink.
Do you think I care if you like your brandy?
- You're drunk and I'm going to bed.
- I'm very drunk...
...and I intend getting still drunker before the evening's over.
But you're not going to bed.
Not yet.
Sit down.
So she stood by you, did she?
How's it feel to have the woman you've wronged cloak your sins?
You're wondering if she knows all about you and Ashley.
You're wondering if she did it just to save face.
You're thinking she's a fool for doing it, even if it saved your hide...
- I will not listen.
- Yes, you'll listen.
Miss Melly's a fool, but not the kind you think.
She has too much honor to conceive of dishonor in anyone she loves.
And she loves you.
Though just why she does,
I'm sure I don't know.
If you weren't so drunk and insulting,
I could explain everything.
- As it is, though...
- You get out of that chair once more...
Of course, the comic figure in all this is the long-suffering Mr. Wilkes.
Mr. Wilkes, who can't be mentally faithful to his wife...
...and won't be unfaithful to her technically.
- Why doesn't he make up his mind?
- Rhett, you...
Observe my hands, my dear.
I could tear you to pieces with them.
And I'd do it if it'd take
Ashley out of your mind forever.
But it wouldn't.
So I'll remove him from your mind forever, this way.
I'll put my hands so.
One on each side of your head.
And I'll smash your skull between them like a walnut.
And that'll block him out.
Take your hands off me, you drunken fool!
You know, I've always admired your spirit, my dear.
Never more than now, when you're cornered.
I'm not cornered.
You'll never corner me or frighten me.
You've lived in dirt so long, you can't understand anything else.
You're jealous of something you can't understand.
Good night.
Jealous, am I?
Yes, I suppose I am.
Even though I know you've been faithful to me all along.
How do I know?
Because I know Ashley Wilkes and his honorable breed.
They're gentlemen.
That's more than I can say for you or for me.
We're not gentlemen.
And we have no honor, have we?
It's not that easy, Scarlett.
You turn me out while you chase Ashley, while you dream of Ashley.
This is one night you're not turning me out.
How are you feeling this morning?
Well, this misery in my back...
...ain't so good.
You act mighty happy this morning.
I am, Mammy. I am.
Oh, she wept with delight
When he gave her a smile
And trembled with fear at his frown
Hello.
I, um...
I'd like to extend my apology for my conduct of last night.
Oh, but, Rhett.
I was very drunk...
...and quite swept off my feet by your charms.
You needn't bother to apologize.
Nothing you do surprises me.
I've been thinking, and I believe it would be better for both of us...
...if we admitted we made a mistake and got a divorce.
- A divorce?
- Yes.
There's no point in holding on to each other.
I'll provide for you.
You've plenty of grounds.
Just give me Bonnie, and you can say what you please.
Thank you, but I wouldn't dream of disgracing the family with a divorce.
You'd disgrace it if Ashley were free.
Makes my head spin to think how quickly you'd divorce me.
Wouldn't you?
Answer me. Wouldn't you?
Please go now and leave me alone.
I'm going. That's what I came to tell you.
I'm going on a very extended trip to London.
- And I'm leaving today.
- Oh.
I'm taking Bonnie with me.
Please get her duds packed right away.
You'll never take my child out of this house.
She's my child too. You're mistaken if you think I'm leaving her here...
...with a mother who doesn't consider her reputation.
You're a fine one to talk.
You think I'll let her out when you'll have her around people like Belle?
If you were a man,
I'd break your neck for that.
I'll thank you to shut your mouth.
As for you giving yourself airs about motherhood...
...a cat's a better mother than you are.
Have her things packed for me in an hour, or I warn you...
...I've always thought a lashing with a whip would benefit you immensely.
Excuse me, Mr. Rhett.
- Hello, Uncle Rhett.
- Hello, Beau.
Daddy, where have you been?
I've been waiting for you all morning.
I've been hunting for a rabbit skin to wrap my little Bonnie in.
Give your best sweetheart a kiss.
Bonnie, I'm going to take you on a long trip to fairyland.
Where? Where?
I'll show you the Tower of London, where the little princes were...
...and London Bridge.
London Bridge?
Will it be falling down?
Well, it will if you want it to, darling.
Daddy, dark!
Dark!
Bonnie! Bonnie!
It's all right, Bonnie.
Who put out that light? Nurse!
Daddy, dark!
Yes, yes, yes...
What's the matter with my Bonnie?
A bear!
Oh, a bear? A big bear?
Dreadful big!
And he sat on my chest!
I'll stay here and shoot him if he comes back.
Oh, good evening, Mr. Butler.
I told you never to leave this child alone in the dark.
Children are often afraid of the dark, but they get over it.
Let her scream for a night...
Let her scream?
Either you're a fool or an inhuman woman.
If you want her to grow up cowardly...
Cowardly? There isn't a cowardly bone in her body.
You're discharged.
As you say, sir.
Where's Mother?
Bonnie...
Aren't you happy here in London with me?
I wanna go home.
Miss Bonnie! And Captain Butler!
Miss Scarlett!
Hello, Mammy!
Honey child!
Miss Scarlett, they's back.
They's back!
Bonnie! Bonnie, baby.
Darling baby!
You glad to be home?
Daddy gave me a kitten.
But London's a horrid place.
Where's my pony?
I wanna go out and see my pony.
You go out and see your pony.
Where's my pony?
I want to go out and see my pony.
You run along with Mammy.
Come on, honey child.
Mammy sure missed you, honey.
Mrs. Butler, I believe.
Mammy said you'd come back.
Only to bring Bonnie.
Apparently any mother, even a bad one, is better than none.
You mean you're going away again?
What perception, Mrs. Butler.
Right away.
- In fact, I left my bags at the station.
- Oh.
You're looking pale.
Is there a shortage of rouge?
Or can this wanness mean you've been missing me?
If I'm pale, it's your fault.
Not because I've been missing you, but because...
Pray continue, Mrs. Butler.
It's because I'm going to have a baby.
Indeed. And who's the happy father?
You know it's yours.
I don't want it any more than you do.
No woman would want the child of a cad like you.
I wish it were anybody's child but yours!
Well, cheer up.
Maybe you'll have an accident.
Is she better?
Has she asked for me?
Don't you understand?
She's delirious.
Rhett...
I want Rhett!
What's the matter, honey?
Did you call somebody, child?
It's no use. It's no use!
Dr. Meade's left.
- Scarlett's dead.
- Oh, no, she's much better.
Really she is.
There, there, Captain Butler, you're beside yourself.
She'll very soon be well again.
I promise you.
She never wanted this baby.
Not want a baby?
Why, every woman wants a baby.
You do, but she doesn't.
Not my children.
She told me she didn't want any more.
I wanted to hurt her because she'd hurt me. And I did.
You mustn't tell me these things.
It's not fair to...
I didn't know about this baby until she fell.
If I'd only known,
I'd have come straight home.
Well, of course you would.
And then when she told me there on the steps, what did I do?
What did I say?
I laughed and I said...
But you didn't mean it.
I know you didn't mean it.
But I did mean it.
I was crazy with jealousy.
She's never cared for me. I tried to make her care, but I couldn't.
You're so wrong.
Scarlett loves you a great deal.
Much more than she knows.
If that were true, I'd wait forever.
If she'd only forgive me.
She will. You must be patient.
No, it's not possible. If you only knew who she really loved...
You wouldn't believe it.
Surely you haven't listened to idle gossip.
No, Captain Butler.
I wouldn't believe it.
There, there. Scarlett's going to get well, and there can be other babies.
She couldn't even if she wanted to.
But of course she could!
I'm going to.
No, Miss Melly, you mustn't risk it.
It's too dangerous.
Children are life renewing itself,
Captain Butler.
And when life does that, danger seems very unimportant.
I've never before known anyone who was really brave.
I pray God things go well with you, Miss Melly.
And I want to thank you for all you've done for me and for Scarlett.
From my heart, I thank you.
Miss Scarlett's feeling a heap better today, Mr. Rhett.
Thank you, Mammy.
I've come to ask your forgiveness...
...hoping our life together has another chance.
Our life together? When did we ever have a life together?
Yes, you're right.
But I'm sure if we could only try again, we could be happy.
What is there to make us happy now?
Well, there's Bonnie...
...and I love you, Scarlett.
When did you discover that?
I've always loved you, but you've never given me a chance to show it.
And just what do you want me to do?
To begin with, give up the mill,
Scarlett. We'll go away.
We'll take Bonnie and have another honeymoon.
Give up the mill?
It's making more money than ever.
I know, but we don't need it.
Sell it.
Or give it to Ashley.
Melanie's been such a friend to us.
Melanie!
If you'd only think more about me!
I am thinking of you.
And I'm thinking that, well...
...maybe the mill's taking you away from me and Bonnie.
I know what you're thinking.
Don't bring Bonnie into it.
- You're taking her away from me.
- But she loves you.
You've made her love you and not me.
She's so spoiled now, that...
Mommy, Daddy! Watch me.
We're watching, darling.
You're mighty pretty, precious.
So are you.
I'm going to jump.
Watch me, Daddy.
I don't think you ought to do much jumping yet.
You just learned to ride sidesaddle.
I will so jump.
I can jump better than ever, because I've grown.
I moved the bar higher.
Don't let her do it, Rhett.
No, Bonnie, you can't.
If you fall off, don't cry and blame me!
Rhett, stop her.
Bonnie!
She's just like Pa.
Just like Pa...!
Bonnie! Bonnie!
Bonnie!
Lordy, Miss Melly.
I sure is glad you's come.
Oh, Mammy, this house won't seem the same without Bonnie.
How's Miss Scarlett bearing up?
Miss Melly, this here's done broke her heart.
I didn't fetch you on Miss Scarlett's account.
What that child got to stand, the good
Lord give her strength to stand.
It's Mr. Rhett I's worried about.
He done lost his mind these last couple of days.
Oh, no, Mammy, no.
I ain't never seen no man, black or white, set such store on any child.
When Dr. Meade say her neck broke...
...Mr. Rhett grabbed his gun and run out and shoot that poor pony.
And for a minute,
I think he gonna shoot hisself.
Oh, poor Captain Butler.
Miss Scarlett called him a murderer for teaching that child to jump.
She said, "You give me my baby what you killed. "
And then he say Miss Scarlett ain't never cared nothing about Miss Bonnie.
It like to turn my blood cold, the things they say to one another.
Stop, Mammy, don't tell me any more.
And then that night...
...Mr. Rhett, he locked hisself in the nursery with Miss Bonnie.
He wouldn't open the door when
Miss Scarlett beat on it and hollered.
And that's where he's been for two whole days.
Oh, Mammy!
This evening, Miss Scarlett shouted through the door and said:
"The funeral's set for tomorrow. "
He says, "You try that, and I kills you tomorrow.
Do you think I's gonna put my child in the dark when she's so scared of it?"
Oh, Mammy, Mammy!
- He has lost his mind!
- Yes'm, that's the God's truth.
He ain't gonna let us bury that child. You gotta help us.
Oh, but I can't intrude.
If you can't help us, who can?
Mr. Rhett always set great store by your opinion.
Please, Miss Melly.
I'll do what I can, Mammy.
Get away from that door and leave us alone.
It's Mrs. Wilkes, Captain Butler.
Please let me in.
I've come to see Bonnie.
Oh, Lord, please help Mr. Rhett in this hour of his grief.
Mammy...
I want you to make a good deal of strong coffee...
...and bring it up to Captain Butler.
I'll go and see Miss Scarlett.
But...
Captain Butler's willing for the funeral to take place tomorrow morning.
Hallelujah! I expect the angels fights on your side, Miss Melly.
Miss Melly! Miss Melly! Miss Melly!
Miss Melly. Miss Melly.
Send for Dr. Meade, Mammy.
And try...
Try to get me home.
Miss Melly! Miss Melly!
Where is my mother going away to?
And why can't I go along, please?
We can't always go along, Beau, as much as we may want to.
You're going back to bed now.
Oh, Rhett, she can't be dying.
She can't be.
She hasn't your strength.
She's never had any.
- She's never had anything but heart.
- You knew that too?
Why do I have to go back to bed?
It's morning.
It isn't really morning yet.
You may come in now, Scarlett.
Dr. Meade, please let me see her.
I've been waiting here two days.
I've got to tell her that I was wrong about something.
She knows you were wrong.
She wants to see Scarlett.
Miss Melly's going to die in peace.
Don't ease your conscience...
...telling her things that make no difference now. You understand?
It's me, Melly.
Promise me?
Anything.
Look after my little son.
I gave him to you once before.
Remember?
The day he was born.
Please, Melly, don't talk this way.
I know you'll get well.
Promise me... college.
Yes, and Europe, and a pony.
Whatever he wants, but...
...oh, Melly, do try.
Ashley...
Ashley and you...
What about Ashley, Melly?
Look after him for me...
...just as you looked after me...
...for him.
I will, Melly.
Look after him...
...but never let him know.
Good night.
Promise?
What else, Melly?
Captain Butler.
- Be kind to him.
- Rhett?
He loves you so.
Yes, Melly.
Goodbye.
You ladies may come in now.
Rhett...
Ashley!
I don't know where the mate to this is.
She must've put it away.
Stop it! Hold me. I'm so frightened!
I'm so frightened!
Scarlett, what can I do?
I can't live without her. I can't!
Everything I ever had is going with her.
Oh, Ashley...
You really love her, don't you?
She's the only dream I ever had that didn't die in the face of reality.
Dreams. Always dreams with you.
Never common sense.
Scarlett, if you knew what
I've gone through!
Ashley, you should've told me years ago that you loved her and not me.
And not left me dangling with your talk of honor.
But you had to wait till now, now when Melly's dying...
...to show me that I could never mean any more to you...
...than this Watling woman does to Rhett.
And I've loved something that doesn't really exist.
But somehow...
...I don't care.
Somehow, it doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter one bit.
Oh, Ashley...
Ashley, forgive me.
Don't cry. She mustn't see you've been crying.
Ashley!
Melly!
Melly!
Rhett! Rhett!
Rhett, where are you?
Rhett, wait for me!
Rhett!
Come in.
Rhett...
Melanie, she's...?
Well, God rest her.
She was the only completely kind person I ever knew.
A great lady. A very great lady.
So she's dead. That makes it nice for you, doesn't it?
How can you say such a thing?
You know how I loved her, really.
No, I don't know that I do.
It's to your credit that you could appreciate her.
Of course I appreciated her.
She thought of everybody except herself.
- Why, her last words were about you.
- What did she say?
She said, "Be kind to Captain Butler...
...he loves you so. "
Did she say anything else?
She said...
She asked me to look after Ashley too.
It's convenient to have the first wife's permission, isn't it?
What do you mean?
What are you doing?
I'm leaving you, my dear.
All you need now is a divorce, and your dreams of Ashley can come true.
Oh, no!
No, you're wrong. Terribly wrong.
I don't want a divorce.
Oh, Rhett, when I knew tonight, when I knew I loved you...
...I ran home to tell you.
Oh, darling, darling!
Please don't go on with this.
Leave us some dignity out of our marriage. Spare us this last.
This last? Do listen to me! I must have loved you for years, only...
...I was such a fool,
I didn't know it.
Please believe me. You must care.
Melly said you did.
I believe you.
And what about Ashley Wilkes?
I never really loved Ashley.
You certainly gave a good imitation of it, up to this morning.
No, Scarlett. I've tried everything.
If you'd met me halfway, even when I came back from London.
I was so glad to see you.
I was, Rhett, but you were so nasty.
Then when you were sick, and it was all my fault.
I hoped that you'd call for me.
But you didn't.
I wanted you. I wanted you desperately...
...but I didn't think you wanted me.
It seems we've been at cross purposes, doesn't it?
But it's no use now.
As long as there was Bonnie, there was a chance we might be happy.
I liked to think that Bonnie was you, a little girl again.
Before the war and poverty had done things to you.
She was so like you.
And I could pet her and spoil her, as I wanted to spoil you.
But when she went, she took everything.
Rhett, please don't say that.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry for everything.
My darling, you're such a child.
You think that by saying, "I'm sorry," all the past can be corrected.
Here, take my handkerchief.
Never, in any crisis of your life, have
I known you to have a handkerchief.
Rhett! Rhett, where are you going?
I'm going to Charleston, back where I belong.
Please. Please take me with you.
No. I'm through with everything here.
I want peace.
I want to see if somewhere...
...there isn't something left in life of charm and grace.
- You know what I'm talking about?
- No!
- I only know that I love you!
- That's your misfortune.
Oh, Rhett!
Rhett!
Rhett! Rhett!
Rhett! If you go, where shall I go?
What shall I do?
Frankly, my dear,
I don't give a damn.
I can't let him go. I can't!
There must be some way to bring him back.
Oh, I can't think about this now.
I'll go crazy if I do.
I'll think about it tomorrow.
But I must think about it!
I must think about it.
What is there to do?
What is there that matters?
You mean to tell me,
Scarlett, Tara doesn't mean anything?
Land's the only thing that matters.
It's the only thing that lasts.
Something you love more than me, though you may not know it. Tara.
It's this from which you get your strength, the red earth of Tara.
Land's the only thing that matters.
The only thing that lasts.
Something you love more than me, though you may not know it.
From which you get your strength. Tara.
Land's the only thing that matters.
Something you love more.
The red earth of Tara.
Tara!
Tara!
Tara!
Tara!
Home.
I'll go home.
And I'll think of some way to get him back.
After all, tomorrow is another day!
But, gentlemen, this is Mysang, the heart of the Moro country, the poison spot of the Philippines.
To take the army out of there at this time is suicide.
I tell you, you mustn't let them do it.
You know what happened at Tagula.
Alipang's on the march, he's taking village after village.
I tell you, we mustn't withdraw the troops from Mysang.
Quite so, Colonel.
On the other hand, I mustn't quarrel with the War Department.
They've ordered the army out of Mysang at once.
And what happens to those poor Philippine natives?
You train them to defend themselves.
Against Alipang?
I couldn't get them ready in 10 years.
And I'm afraid
Alipang won't wait that long.
He's got thousands of Moro bandits in the jungle just waiting for the American Army to leave.
It'll be slaughter.
You'll have to stop him, Colonel Hatch.
With what? Raw native troops?
Yes, with native troops.
As long as our army's there the Filipinos will depend on them.
Sooner or later, they'll have to take care of themselves.
It's your job to prepare them.
We're making Mysang a sort of test.
If it works out there, it's bound to work out in the rest of the islands.
Well, I can tell you now, as soon as Alipang learns the troops have left, he'll pounce on us.
In 48 hours, I'll be screaming for help.
There'll be no one listening, Colonel.
These are the men who are going to help you.
This is Manning.
We picked him, because he knows the Moro country.
This is Hartley.
The best drillmaster and disciplinarian in the service.
This is Larson.
He never disobeyed an order in his life.
And this is McCool.
He never took an order in his life, but he's the best one-man army in the Philippines.
Who's that?
This? Oh, this is
Canavan, the doctor.
He's been ordered to Mysang to keep the other four alive.
Your orders, Colonel.
- Thank you, sir.
- Good luck.
All right, men, fall in. Come on, Jake!
Hey, Jake!
Come on!
All right, men. Get in, get in.
Look alive, men.
We, who are about to die, salute you.
Now, Padre, I've tried to tell you...
We have been praying since dawn for a miracle that would stop the American troops from leaving Mysang.
I'm afraid not even a miracle can change the orders of the General Staff, Padre.
Now, I've been here for some time.
Let me tell you what'll happen here.
I have been here all my life.
I know what will happen here.
And soon. Soon.
Alipang is bringing together all the Moro tribes on Mindanao.
As soon as the American troops are gone, the Moros will come down from the hills.
They will kill all the men, and carry away all the women and children into slavery.
For you, it will be a report written in ink.
But for my people, it will be a report written in blood.
Hard on your starboard, hard on board, boys.
How many
American officers have been left?
A handful.
One by one, they must be destroyed until they send the troops into the jungle to seek revenge.
Who's in command of the post?
Colonel Hatch.
We begin with him.
Amal.
Let me carry the bags!
- Let me carry the bags!
- Let me carry the bags!
- Let me carry the bags!
- Let me carry the bags!
- Let me carry the bags!
You haven't, by any chance, got leprosy?
What's the Indian sign you've got on those other kids, anyway?
You're not a Filipino, are you?
No.
A Moro?
Oh, so that's it.
What's your name?
Miguel.
All right, Mike, you can take my bags up to the headquarters.
You bet your life.
Swede.
Look. It's Bill.
The doc.
Company, dismissed!
Dismissed!
Bill, you old sawbones, how are you?
How are you?
Hiya, Doc, welcome to Mysang.
How are you, Swede?
You still boiling your water?
Did you bring any beer with you?
How's "Vinegar" Steffens, huh?
Oh, they call the old colonel
"Honey Boy" Steffens now.
- I took out a gallstone out of him.
- You did?
Yeah. Oh, here.
Present for you.
Oh, how did you know?
All my life, I've wanted a gallstone.
Still collecting orchids, Swede?
- Sure.
- Here.
Orchidacea dendrobium.
Hey, I've been looking for one of these all my life.
Ain't that a beauty?
Colonel Hatch, this is that Datu I told you about, the friendly Moro chieftain.
- He's been very helpful.
- How do you do?
Sit down.
Colonel, the Datu agrees that there'll always be trouble as long as Alipang's around.
There will never be peace until you go into the jungle and destroy him.
We're not going into the jungle or any other place.
We're here to preserve peace and train the native troops.
Say, what kind of a place is this?
What have you got around here?
Oh, everything.
Malaria, small pox, typhoid...
Poker, pinochle, blackjack.
...lice, mice, alligators, crocodiles, red ants, white ants, and now rats.
The Smith brothers.
They're collaborating with me on some work I'm doing on beriberi.
The Koran says that rats are creatures of ill omen.
Well, Captain, it's in our laps now.
From now on, the little brothers will have to stand on their own feet.
If they can.
If they can.
Allah!
You'd better go in, Padre.
I thought I missed when I shot at that juramentado, but I guess I didn't.
He had enough lead in him to sink a battleship.
Doctor, a juramentado is like a horse.
The only place to stop them is right here.
Only you feel sorry for the horse.
I've heard of these fanatics that go berserk.
But I never saw one before.
I wonder what kept the bugger going with all those slugs in him?
Must be some drug.
The drug that keeps them going is what keeps most of us going.
Faith, good or bad.
The juramentado believes that when he kills an infidel, it is a passport to heaven.
But I didn't know they selected the victims.
I thought they just attacked the first Christian they met?
I am a Christian, yet he didn't attack me.
Well, perhaps, I am not a good Christian.
Good night, señores.
Good night, Padre.
Well, when you come to think of it, that Moro went right by the bunch of us to get to one man, the Commanding Officer.
I wouldn't be surprised if...
Bolo cut?
Do you ever have headaches?
- No.
- Dizzy spells?
No. I'm perfectly all right.
You must have a skull of cast iron.
Bad place for a bolo cut, the nerve center.
I knew a man up in Samoa...
Are you the man that owns that coconut raft?
What were you doing in the jungle?
Who are these men?
Couple of Moros who don't belong in the village.
Where did you find them?
Well, we went for a little stroll and we found them prowling around on the edge of the jungle.
Lieutenant, you know the orders about reprisals.
Captain, all I know is that Colonel Hatch...
He gave the orders.
Come in to the office.
Captain, look, give me a squad.
Let us try some of this juramentado business.
That's what I want to talk to you about.
Gentleman, I've been looking over
Colonel Hatch's notes.
His plan of procedure.
He felt that Alipang would use every effort to lure us into the bush before we were ready.
Well, he was right.
That juramentado was
Alipang's first move.
But it won't work.
We're going to stay right in our own backyard.
Here's an order Colonel Hatch prepared forbidding any move into the jungle until the native troops are fully trained.
He never got a chance to sign it.
How am I gonna get any orchids if we can't go out in the jungle?
Ask him if we can go a little way.
- Go on. Ask him.
- Shut up.
Well, it's signed.
Captain Hartley, it's your job to make soldiers out of these Filipinos if you have to work them 24 hours a day.
From now on, it's drill.
Drill, drill, drill!
Left arm, cut and parry, engage!
Right arm, cut and parry, engage!
One, two, three, four.
Right, left.
Hey, you, number three! Right face!
Chest out!
Stomach in! Raise shoulder!
Forward, double time, march!
Hurry it up. Hurry it up. Come on.
Over the wall. Come on.
Come on. Come on.
Come on, come on.
That was lovely, boys.
Left arm, cut and parry.
Over the wall.
Come on. Come on.
Ready! Come on, come on, come on, quicker!
Like a lot of old women in a sewing circle.
It's still too slow! Do it again!
March, left. Hup, two, three, four...
That's it.
Left, right, left.
- One, two, three...
- Lieutenant Yabo.
Company, halt!
Why are these men drilling without shoes?
Tenyente Canavan, he said take them off.
Oh, he did, did he?
Have them put them on again.
Sergeant.
- Yes, sir.
- What's going on here?
Tenyente say we do this one hour every day.
- Tenyente...
- Tenyente who?
Tenyente Canavan.
What do you mean by telling the men they could drill without shoes?
Shoes? Oh, yes.
Well, it was just a suggestion.
I happened to be passing by and they were having an awful time.
In agony.
They've got to get used to shoes, sooner or later.
Well, don't you suppose it can be done gradually?
After all, men weren't born with shoes.
Dr. Canavan probably meant it as a health measure.
Is it a health measure to rig up a dummy and have men standing around pulling its nose?
Oh, that.
Oh, that was just a little applied psychology.
The Filipinos are scared stiff of this what's-his-name, Alipang.
They jump when you mention his name.
That's why I rigged up that dummy.
Stupid.
You wouldn't think it was stupid if you'd seen the shaking lineup of men at sick call after Hatch was killed.
Sick call is a good excuse to avoid work.
Yeah, I know.
And it's true that there was nothing organically wrong with those men, but they were sick just the same, sick with fear.
And when fear becomes so deep and unreasoning, it's a disease.
It'll be cured when they learn how to handle a gun.
You stick to your pills.
And I'll take care of the training schedule.
Captain, there's a man who either has high blood pressure or something on his mind.
Just as I've always dreamed it.
Taken me years to find, but here it is.
As green as Ireland, not a snake in the place, and a beach like powdered sugar.
Have you seen my fatigues?
Look, Bill,
10 miles south of there.
Mac, don't tell me you've finally found your island?
Yeah. And as soon as we finish up this job, I'm moving in.
That'll be the world of Terence McCool.
A darling of an island. A Garden of Eden.
You better start looking for an Eve.
Oh, no, I want peace and quiet.
Come here.
Where'd you find them?
Under bed, but it need shine.
No want dinero. Want him.
What for?
Anting-anting. Bring good luck.
Well, didn't you tell me
Moros weren't afraid of anything?
You bet your life.
Well, what you want anting-anting for?
Moro no afraid of things he can see, only afraid of things he can't see.
Well, what about bullets?
You can see them.
No see bullets. Bullets...
You no believe in anting-anting?
No.
Then what you got those rats for?
Oh, well, they're to help me find out something I want to know.
Something you no see?
That's it.
Anting-anting.
Hey, Doc! Come here a minute, will you?
Look, Doc. One of Swede's orchids is due for the stalk.
Well, how soon, Larson?
Any day now.
Do you know, I do a lot of this pollinating in my spare time.
Think it'll have to be a cesarean?
Well, it all depends. What kind is it?
It's a Paphiopedilum.
Just a plain Paphiopedilum?
Oh, no, it's a Paphiopedilum fairrieanum.
Oh, that's nothing.
You know, I wanna get a white orchid.
That's why I'm down here.
You gotta go an awful long way before you run across a white orchid.
It's called Cragg.
It fires many bullets at once.
How many they have?
Three hundred.
Bullets?
Enough.
One of these guns worth 20 bulls.
If we get them, you be sultan of Mindanao.
We must get them now.
No, no, Tuan.
They must attack us.
But why they wait?
We kill commander.
Why they not send men?
Perhaps when we send the juramentado to kill the new commander, Manning, they send men.
Oh, Steve!
Aren't you coming down to the landing?
I want you to meet my wife.
Yes, certainly. Go on ahead.
I'll be with you in a few minutes.
Right.
Linda, if you believe in marriage, never say yes to a soldier.
Ever since I've been married,
I've been chasing my husband all over the world.
I haven't seen him this time in over a year.
I know just how you feel.
I haven't seen my father in over four years.
I hope he recognizes me.
Hey. Hey!
Do you got a box there for me?
Larson. L-A-R-S-O-N.
Bill. Bill!
Bill, look, I got a letter from a lawyer in Manila.
I wrote to him just to make quite sure.
And they say they've found the titles to the island.
It doesn't belong to anybody.
I can just move right in.
I don't even have to buy it.
So what I'm going to do...
Hey, Bill, Mac.
Look, my orchid seeds arrived from Battlement Gordon.
Oh, darling.
Oh, George, my ribs!
Oh, bless your ribs.
Bless your heart. Bless you.
As president of the reception committee of the port of Mysang...
Linda!
Pardon me.
Linda, this is the man
I've been telling you about.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
Ladies, may I present
Lieutenants McCool, Canavan, and Larson.
This is Mrs. Manning and Captain Hartley's daughter, Miss Linda Hartley.
- How do you do?
- But, George, where's Captain Hartley?
He should be here now. I just left him.
- Oh, he's right... Will you come with us?
- Yeah!
Yeah, we know, over here.
How long do you expect to stay, Miss Hartley?
As long as my father will let me.
I know I'm going to like it here.
Larson here spends all his time in his horticulture, and the doctor has his hands full of patients and things, but I have nothing to do.
I'd love to show you all the sights.
The public library, the art museum.
And we could swim out 10 miles and see my island.
I'd like to show you my orchids sometime, Miss Hartley.
No, I'm not at all busy with patients.
I only have two. A couple of rats.
One of them's pretty sick.
What's the matter with him?
Dying of a lonely heart, like I am.
Well, here you are, Miss Hartley.
Here's where you live.
Well, thank you.
Thank all of you.
Linda!
Dad!
How did you... When did...
I couldn't believe my eyes.
Didn't you recognize me?
Well, you've changed.
Where are the freckles?
What did you do with the skinny legs and your braids?
You see, if I'd waited any longer,
I'd have been an old woman.
After the earthquake at San Francisco,
I just made up my mind.
You'll never know how much I worried about you.
Even when I knew you were safe,
I wanted to hop the first boat.
And I beat you to it.
Why didn't you write you were coming?
I was too smart. You might have said no.
Oh, you are glad to see me, aren't you?
Glad?
Linda, you're the one person in the world I wanted to see most.
I have the cutest little place fixed up in Manila.
Right near the Luneta.
Oh, darling, could you possibly be as happy as I am?
We're going to have to change our plans a little.
Don't tell me there's been another delay in your leave of absence.
My leave's off.
I'm assigned here indefinitely.
George, it was all arranged.
Sorry, Mabel. Can't be helped.
The C.O. Died, and...
Who?
Colonel Hatch. You never met him.
So, you see, that puts me in command.
Well, it was a mighty nice little house, but I guess we can make this one do.
Oh, George.
Sorry, Mabel.
All the way over
I kept thinking how wonderful it would be to drop in on you like this, as if I'd come from just around the corner.
But, Dad, what happened?
Oh, I got it last year.
But it's all right now.
We'll paint the town red.
We'll have a wonderful time.
The boat stops over for four whole days.
Four days?
Oh, no.
This time you don't get rid of me so easily. I'm here for keeps.
Linda, I'm sorry, but that's impossible just now.
There's nothing I'd like better, but you couldn't have chosen a worse time.
I wouldn't have much time for you, darling.
You'd be alone most of the time.
I've been alone most of the time.
I know.
Manning.
Come on. Buck up, old girl. It's your party.
Sorry, darling.
I was just trying to get used to the idea of going back again without you.
Buy you a drink.
And tonight, just before I came over here, the rat that had been getting polished rice died.
Died of beriberi.
No beriberi on my island.
No rats. No mice.
No doctors.
You should see it as I first saw it, shining in the sun, a pearl set in turquoise.
A pimple in the Pacific.
Excuse me, Miss Hartley.
I'm officer of the day and I won't be able to stay for the dancing, and I thought if you...
I...
Here.
Why, thank you, Lieutenant.
Why, it's lovely.
I've never seen one like this before.
It's a Paphiopedilum fairrieanum.
Oh, no, Bill.
It's a Brassocattleya trufuttiana.
Don't let him scare you. It's just an orchid.
Will you wear it?
I'd love to.
I brought a pin.
Thank you.
I'm breeding a species of my own, a white orchid, and, well, I'd like to name it after you.
Orchidaceae linda.
If you don't mind.
Well, I'd be greatly honored.
Well, thanks, that's...
I gotta go now.
I gotta pollinate.
To us.
Linda. That's Spanish for "beautiful."
Linda. That's what I'll call my island.
Linda Island.
Look.
It's 10 miles off there, with a beach like swan's down when you stretch out on it and gaze up at the powder puff clouds.
And the birds sing, and your heart sings with them.
Then the sea steals up and tickles your toes, which is bad if you're ticklish.
Oh, I see.
How long have you been in the service?
Three years.
I expect to quit next year and hang up my shingle back home.
I'd never quit if I were in the army.
You like the service?
I think it's the most wonderful career in the world.
When I was six, my greatest ambition was to be a top sergeant in my father's company.
Queer ambition for a girl.
I don't see why.
The happiest time of my life was when I was a kid at the presidio.
Most children had to be satisfied with toy soldiers.
But I had real ones.
Most of my male ancestors were soldiers with a remarkable talent for getting killed.
When I was 10, my father bought me a uniform.
I liked it much better than any dress I ever had.
I guess I should have been born a boy.
Oh, no.
My great-grandfather was Wellington's adjutant.
He lost a leg at Waterloo.
My grandfather, he was only a sergeant major, he drowned in his own blood at the Alamo with David Crockett.
- Really?
- My father lies at Chickamauga...
And lies. And lies, and lies, and lies.
Datu, there's something
I'd like you to do for me.
Very glad.
My wife's going back to Manila, and I'd like to give her a little present.
You deal in pearis, and I thought maybe...
I could get you some, but not before the boat leaves.
Oh, that's too bad. I did want to...
There is a lace peddler outside, with shawls and scarves.
He may have something your wife might like.
Oh. Thank you, Datu.
- Go in, Zeruphina.
- Okay.
You better go home and get some rest.
Isn't there anything I can do?
She's all right now.
She'll need some looking after when she comes out of it, though.
I'll hang around.
She was so happy when I met her on the boat.
All she could talk about was him and how she was going to take him back to Manila with her.
She was so frantic to get here, and...
What brought you here?
An earthquake.
The one at San Francisco.
It was ghastly.
Everywhere people were crying out, calling for help.
The living and the dying, all calling for someone.
And suddenly I found myself doing the same thing.
I was calling to my father.
I hadn't seen him for years, he was thousands of miles away, and yet I called to him as if he really could help me.
Funny, wasn't it?
No. No.
People always have to have somebody to call to when they're in trouble.
You find that out when you attend the dying.
If they haven't got somebody, they usually invent somebody.
Even when they're not in trouble, people make up people.
I used to do it when I was a kid, my kid sister and I.
I invented my first patient.
Who was he?
The President of the United States.
Really?
He had a strange new malady.
Nobody knew what it was.
All the specialists in the world couldn't do a thing for him till they sent for me.
I cured him. Just like that.
I guess that's what made me decide on the medical profession.
George!
And from now on,
I want double sentry duty.
Larson, round up every Moro living in the village, take them to the guardhouse. Go on.
Yes, sir.
McCool, I want a stockade built around the fort, and beyond that, barbed wire.
All we've got. Go on.
Yes, sir.
Yabo, instruct the guard.
Nobody's allowed inside without a special pass. Nobody. Go on.
Yes, sir.
Captain, if a Moro can go juramentado, why can't a white man?
There'll be no expeditions, alone or in groups, under any circumstances.
Those are still the orders.
The Moro that killed Captain Manning had this around his neck.
All the Moros wear anting-anting to protect them.
From what?
The Moros aren't afraid of anything, not even death.
I am not afraid of death, either, yet you see I wear an anting-anting, too.
It is a symbol of something you believe in.
And if you believe in something, it's so.
That's true.
Take a look in here.
Those men all believe in something.
Fear.
They're all sick with fear.
Canavan.
I'm not gonna stand for this business of turning your hospital into a refuge for slackers.
There are more men in here than there are on the parade ground drilling.
If it keeps up, they'll all be in.
You're right, Captain, but...
Get them out.
There's nothing the matter with them.
Yes, there is.
That Moro that struck Captain Manning down struck them down, too, but not with a bolo.
They're down with a disease medicine can't cure.
They'll be all right when they learn how to use a gun, when they're properly drilled.
The trouble is that you're trying to drill things into them, when you should be drilling things out of them.
What good's a gun when your finger's so paralyzed with fright that you can't pull a trigger?
Sergeant, get these men out of here.
Have them report for duty.
From now on there'll be no more of this pampering.
All he knows comes out of a book of regulations.
He's so hipped on uniforms, he never stops to consider what's inside of them.
Like trying to talk to a stone wall.
You said yourself it was a disease that medicine can't cure.
Yes. But there must be a cure.
If I only knew the Achilles' heel of the Moro.
What he's afraid of.
There must be something.
There is something.
The Moro is not afraid to die, but he's mortally afraid of being buried in a pigskin.
- Pigskin?
- Yeah.
Ridiculous, isn't it?
But not to the Moro.
He believes it sends him straight to hell.
Father Felipe, you've done it.
You've isolated the germ for me.
The pigskin might be the salvation of Mysang.
I'd rather have the American Army.
Hey, hey, hey, hey. What's going on here?
I got orders to round up all the Moros in the village and put them in the guardhouse.
- Come on.
- No, wait a minute.
All the village Moros are friendly.
Hartley says round them up.
Well, Mike here, he's just a kid.
He was born and raised here.
He's a Moro.
Well, you leave him with me and I'll turn him in.
All right, Bill, but you tell Hartley.
I don't want any part of it.
I won't go to guardhouse.
I'll run away to jungle.
You mustn't do that, Mike.
You'll get into trouble.
No trouble for me in jungle.
You know your way around in the bush?
You bet your life.
Then get a couple of canteens and some rope, and wait for me down at the bridge.
- We go to the jungle?
- Yeah.
You better take your anting-anting.
I've got anting-anting.
Now, you better get going.
What is it?
What is it, Mike?
Spear trap.
Jungle's full of them.
Alipang's gang.
What are they doing?
They're fixing juramentado to run amuck.
Alipang sending juramentado to kill Hartley.
Get the canteens.
Tie him up, Mike.
It was such a pretty little house.
Right near the Luneta.
Linda, if you're ever in love with a man, don't leave him, not for a single second.
Well, I guess that's about all.
You'd better run along now and do your own packing.
I'll see you at the boat.
Linda, you know you haven't packed yet.
Any news of Dr. Canavan?
No.
Linda, don't think
I like shipping you out like this.
What do you suppose happened to him, Dad?
I don't know.
I want you to wire me as soon as you get home.
You can send the telegram to Manila and it will be forwarded to me here.
Aren't you even going to send out a searching party?
What for?
When a man deliberately disobeys an order...
But he's a non-combatant.
Perhaps he didn't realize your order applied to him. The least you can do is...
I've told you I'm not gonna risk any more lives searching for an insubordinate fool!
But he's not. You don't know him, Dad.
Wherever he is, he's doing something for somebody else.
I don't see how you can be so cold-blooded when your best man...
Well, one of your best men.
What makes you so interested in Canavan all of a sudden?
Well, I'm not. I...
I'd feel the same way about anybody.
You'd better finish packing.
You don't want to hold up the boat.
I've just been talking to Yabo.
He says if we ever see the doc again, it'll be in a pit, with his head sticking out covered with honey and some ants crawling around him.
Hey, what are you doing, Mac?
Hey, wait a minute, Mac. You can't do this.
Hartley's given strict orders.
Nobody in their right senses...
Who said I was in my right senses?
I got a touch of the sun.
Wait a minute, Mac.
I got a touch of that sun, too.
Hey, Swede, look.
You, you dimwitted crack, you ought to have been caught and had your head stuffed full of honey
- and put in an ant heap.
- You should have fell in a ditch.
- Where've you been?
- What do you got here?
Genus Homo moro juramentado.
Yabo!
Get that pigskin.
Everybody, come here.
I wanna talk to you.
Come on. Come on in closer.
This is what you were afraid of when the American soldiers went home.
You were sad, and you should have been happy.
Happy because this is your country.
And if it's your country, you've got to protect it.
But you never will as long as you're afraid of men like this.
He thinks you're only fit for slaves, and that's because you act like slaves.
Fear has made you slaves.
Take a look at him.
If we were to cut him open, we'd find he only had one heart, one stomach, approximately 25 feet of intestines.
No more and no less than you have.
Then what makes him a better man?
You!
Because you're afraid of him.
I'll show you what you're afraid of.
Yabo!
All right. Now tell him we're gonna bury him in the pigskin.
Put him in it.

All right, let him go.
Now look at him.
Your brave Moro.
Your terrible warrior who won't let you work your rice fields or fish the seas in peace.
How can you be afraid of that worm crawling on the ground, howling for mercy, begging for help, scared out of his skin because of the skin of a dead pig?
Oh, take a good look at him.
Listen to him muffering.
Is that the man to be afraid of?
- Larson, take this man to the guardhouse.
- Yes, sir.
- Yabo, get these men back to their drilling.
- Yes, sir.
And you, come to my office.
Fall in!
You knew what my orders were about going out in the jungle.
Captain, you ought to frame that pigskin.
Those men have had a shot in the arm, vaccinated against fear, and I think it's gonna work.
We've deliberately avoided making trouble with Alipang until the troops were properly trained.
Well, you fixed that.
Raiding their camp, capturing a prisoner.
You've got them all stirred up.
In all probability, they'll attack.
No, no, that's not their plan.
Their plan is to kill every officer on the post first.
Hatch and Manning were the beginning.
I found that out.
I don't care what you found out.
You've been a meddling fool right from the start, and now you've disobeyed orders.
I'm warning you.
If you step over the line again,
I'll confine you to quarters.
That's all.
That juramentado he captured must have been on his way to kill you.
I imagine Dr. Canavan saved your life.
Yes. I know.
Next time you're gonna play those games in the jungle, why don't you take me with you?
I'm rather good at that sort of thing.
I can start a fire by rubbing two Boy Scouts together, and I can even cross a river in a paper bag when I'm in good form.
I couldn't think of it, Mac.
That would be disobeying orders.
I'll be in in a minute, Mac.
You're leaving today, aren't you?
Well, in case I don't see you...
I was worried for fear I wouldn't get back in time to say goodbye.
We were all worried, for fear you wouldn't get back at all.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Didn't take me that long to say goodbye to her.
"Parting is such sweet sorrow
"That I shall say 'Good Night' till it be morrow."
- Alack, my friend...
- Shut up, you ape.
All packed, Linda?
I'm not going.
Canavan?
I'm afraid I must insist that you take the boat, Linda.
I'm sorry, Father.
I'm staying here.
We must change our plans, Alipang.
They never come to the jungle to fight.
Yes, they will.
They come to jungle.
What's the matter?
Hey, what's the matter?
Hey. What are they talking about?
Oh, they says the water went down two feet in the last hour.
Perhaps there's been a landslide that made the river change its course.
No, it happened too quickly for that.
Maybe it disappeared into a subterranean channel or something.
Captain, I just came back from the hills.
I saw many Moros carry bamboo, rocks.
Alipang, he dammed up the river.
Another trick to lure us out in the jungle.
But it won't work.
- But the river...
- We don't need the river.
The old well, we'll use that.
We'll rig up a still and use seawater.
A man named Cragg invented the repeating rifle and a man named Jenner invented vaccinations.
And if the Philippines ever becomes a nation of its own, who'll get the credit?
Cragg.
But who will it belong to?
Jenner.
The whole post's in an uproar about a few Moros when all around them are billions of enemies, whole regiments of disease, to a few of which you are now more or less immune.
Thank you.
Thank you, too, for saving my father's life.
I heard about it.
Say, what's the matter with your father, anyway? What's he afraid of?
Afraid?
He acts like a little boy who's lost his way home and is scared somebody's gonna find out about it.
Why doesn't he do something about the river, and why doesn't he...
Every time you mention my father, you criticize him.
I'm sorry.
Tenyente Canavan.
When you bring in Moro prisoner, you said this is our country, we must protect it.
Tenyente, we are ready now.
Say that again.
Alipang dry up our river.
The people are frightened.
We don't know what Alipang does next.
We want to fight, Tenyente.
We would rather die than live like this.
We think maybe you speak to Captain Hartley.
Come on!
Captain Hartley, now's your chance.
These boys aren't afraid of Alipang anymore. He's got them fighting mad.
They want to go now and have it out with him.
- Go where?
- Into the jungle, after him.
That's out of the question.
But listen, Captain, if these boys are ever gonna lick Alipang, this is the moment.
We'll lick him by staying right here.
Yabo, take these men back to drilling.
Wait! Look here, Captain...
That's all.
No, that isn't all.
You were sent down here to train these men till they were ready to defend themselves.
Well, they're ready now, and if you can't see that, you're as blind as a bat.
- Canavan.
- What are you waiting for?
If this place is the testing ground, the independence of the Philippines rests with those boys.
Well, they say they're ready to be tested.
What right have you got to stand in their way?
You're forgetting yourself.
They're fighting for existence and nothing's gonna stop them.
And if they let you do it, they're just plain stupid.
Canavan, you're under arrest for insubordination.
Yabo, confine him to his quarters.
Doctor, there are some sick people in the village who need attention.
Tell them to boil their water.
Give them Mag Sulph.
Maybe they need a little drilling.
You better get out and look them over.
I'm confined to quarters.
I've decided to suspend your order of arrest.
And I've decided to remain here during the rest of my stay at Mysang. I'm sorry.
If you persist in this attitude, you will force me to prefer charges against you.
Fine.
I hope you use your influence to have me cashiered.
Save me the bother of resigning.
Doctor!
Dr. Canavan.
He is sick. Very sick.
What is it?
Cholera.
And up into the corners, the walls, the shelves and everything.
Use plenty of carbolic.
No fresh fruit sold in the store.
No coconuts, bananas, mangoes.
Nothing. Understand?
Boil your water. Scald all your dishes.
And don't serve any uncooked food of any kind.
Understand?
And tell the other women.
All food for the patients must be cooked in company kitchens.
- No food shipped in and out of the harbor.
- Yes, sir.
Get some men started digging lime, and post a guard by the well.
- And no water to be taken out of it.
- Yes, sir.
Doctor.
Here's the list of supplies I need.
Cottonseed oil, calamo, all the canned milk you've got in the storehouse.
Buckets, shovels, and add lime and...
Don't you think you could read this better if you held it right-side up?
There's one thing that isn't on that list that we need more than anything else.
Water.
- There's the old well.
- It's no good. It's polluted.
That's what started the cholera.
And it's not only drinking water we need, it's sewage.
The whole village is a mess of pollution.
You've got to send somebody up into the hills to dynamite the dam.
It's sure death to send anybody.
It's sure death here unless we get running water.
It's out of the question.
If we don't get running water in Mysang pretty soon, there won't be any Mysang.
Better get down to the village quick, Doc, they're dropping like flies.
No more water. Put it back.
Dr. Canavan said, anybody who tries to get water here, shoot him.
All right, come on, step it up.
The doc needs the lime. Step it up.
Take everything out of here, that bedding, the mattress, and everything and burn it.
On your way. On your way.
Come on, on your way.
You got to get out of here.
What are you going to do with all these families you're evicting?
Drown them. How do I know what I'm gonna do with them?
I'm sorry. I've gotta figure that out later.
First we've got to clear out all these infected houses.
What are you doing here anyway?
I want to help.
You see that lime over there?
Make a saturated solution, then go from house to house and disinfect the dishes.
Doc, there are some more people for the hospital.
The hospital's full now.
But we can use the clubhouse.
I'll get blankets and prepare for them.
Thank you, Padre.
Doc! They need you over at the hospital.
Hey! Hey! What's going on here?
He throw me in guardhouse,
I no go with him.
Go where?
Captain Hartley's given me orders to dynamite the dam.
I'm taking the squad with me.
We need Mike to show us the way.
I no go!
Mike, I need running water, bad.
You bet your life.
So long, Bill.
- Goodbye, Mac.
- Godspeed.
What orchids I'm gonna bring back.
I hope it won't be lilies.
You're just about as jumpy as the rest of us.
Last night when a man went down to relieve the sentry by the river, the sentry shot at him.
They're so nervous around here, they're shooting at shadows.
- Captain.
- Yes.
Larson should've been back long ago.
Well?
Well, what are you going to do about it?
I can't spare any men.
Suppose there's an attack on the post.
I wish there were. So does everyone else.
Why hasn't it come?
- Why don't we do something?
- McCool!
I'm sorry, sir.
What's wrong with you?
Nothing.
Better see Dr. Canavan. You're not well.
Listen, sir, Larson hasn't got a chance out there, and everyone here is getting so jumpy just sitting around
- waiting for something to happen...
- That's enough, McCool!
Yes, sir.
Here's looking at you, Mac.
Bottoms up.
He's gonna be all right.
I think we caught it in time.
The germ hasn't been found that can stop him.
You better go home and get some rest. You need it.
I'm all right.
You haven't had 40 winks in the last 40 hours.
Neither have you.
You know, I'm beginning to dislike this guy Alipang for the first time.
Why doesn't he come down and fight like a man?
I'm making war with germs instead of bolos.
I don't think the Filipinos are afraid of Alipang now.
They're more afraid of the cholera.
I wonder what happened to Larson?
He couldn't have lost his way, he had Mike with him.
Well,
I'll know a whole lot more about cholera by the time I get home.
Linda?
Have you ever thought about taking up nursing?
What's the matter?
She's all right. She's just been on her feet too long, and fell asleep.
Sit down a minute, will you?
I'm pretty busy.
I know, I want to talk to you.
Have a cigarette.
How's McCool?
Pretty sick.
What are you going to do about Larson?
I don't know.
He never got to the dam.
No.
It's a funny thing about Larson's passion for orchids.
Big, clumsy, sweet.
Still, I have an uncle back home, a blacksmith.
He has tremendous hands.
Can bend a horseshoe with them.
But you ought to see him in the garden with his flowers.
Canavan, I'm going blind.
That bolo cut on the head hit the optical nerve.
It's been getting worse lately.
Why didn't Colonel Hatch order you to the base hospital?
He did. I tore up the medical report when he died.
So I wouldn't see it.
What did the report say?
It recommended retirement, but I had other plans.
Suicide?
What are you talking about?
I know, a report would read,
"Killed in action." Is that it?
That's better than rotting away in an officer's club.
Fact is you're afraid.
Afraid to live. That's much worse than being afraid to die.
Dying is easy. One way of running out.
Running out?
Do you know what failure here means?
Mysang isn't just an isolated village, it's a test.
If we can hold out here, the whole job in the Philippines is done.
Well, I've failed.
I've got to send for the army.
What good would that do?
It'd take days, maybe weeks.
Maybe you can wait that long, but the cholera can't.
What can I do?
Larson's gone,
- McCool's sick, and I'm...
- You're not blind yet!
You're not a failure.
You've just quit.
You're as choked up with fear as those men of yours were.
Afraid of blindness.
Afraid of failure.
Why don't you stop being sorry for yourself and do something?
We don't need the army, we need running water.
Doctor, it is true.
The people all die unless the river runs again.
Many have died already.
Some are Moros, my people.
If you give me men,
I'll lead them myself to the riverhead to break up the dam.
Give me but a score of men with rifles.
I have already sent one expedition.
Until I hear from Lieutenant Larson...
You will not hear from him.
How do you know?
Well, I am told he followed the river.
That was wrong.
The riverhead is guarded by Alipang's men.
But there is another trail.
Mike.
Mike.
What happened to Larson?
Killed...
Everybody...
Ambush.
Captain, soon it'll be too late.
Larson...
Datu...
Datu...
Mike.
It's a good thing you held on to anting-anting.
You bet your life.
Mike, what about the Datu?
You were mumbling about the Datu, Mike.
Mike, try to remember.
Mike, the Datu.
Datu.
Datu.
He with Alipang's men.
Datu killed Larson.
Where's Captain Hartley?
He went to blow out dam.
Did the Datu go with him?
How many men did they take?
Thirty-two.
And the Datu take some Moros.
Moros? What for?
To carry dynamite.
Mac.
Mac.
Mac, listen.
Old Drill 'Em's in trouble.
I've got to go after him.
Mac.
Mac, come out of it, please.
Listen, you're in charge. There's nobody else.
You've got to take over.
- Yeah.
- Understand?
Mac, take care of Linda.
The river bends and turns, we could go straight up.
You see, no ambush, no trouble.
How soon before we get there?
One hour we'll be there.
Datu.
Why are we going up?
Shouldn't we be down in the gully?
We make circle.
Soon we come to the riverhead.
How soon?
Half an hour.
Just a few minutes more, we'll be there.
Canavan?
Why are you bringing the men this way for when you know the river's in that direction?
That way dangerous.
Yes, I know. I just saw Larson, what the ants left of him.
Hang him up.
Tie his hands behind his back.
Yes, sir.
Give me your bayonet.
There's plenty of dynamite left.
He was leading you into an ambush, so it must be close by.
I'm going up to the dam, the river way.
How many men do you want?
None. My friend here, the Datu, knows the way.
He'll make a perfect shield.
You go down to the river and wait for me.
And I'll follow it down and join you.
You're going to take me to the dam.
Come on.
Yabo.
Yes, sir.
Call in the men.
Fall in!
Come on. Keep going.
What's the matter?
Get going!
The river!
The river.
The river's running!
The river!
The river!
The river!
The river! The river is running!
Captain,
I just left Alipang's camp and there's not a Moro left.
You know what that means.
They're probably attacking the village.
We've gotta get back there quickly.
The river.
Yabo!
- Yabo!
- Yes, sir.
Get the men started building rafts.
Yes, sir.
Steve,
I'll take a couple of men and leave on the first raft.
All right.
Pull out the guards!
The Moros are coming!
Sylvia, sound for the alarm!
Linda!
Get the gate shut.
Get those gates shut.
Many guns, many bullets in the fort.
We take them.
Get those closed.
Stand back. Let's go!
Man the walls!
Mac!
Linda, take my temperature.
I'm feeling better already.
Go to village. Get prisoners.
Stick close to the Captain.
He's going to need help.
It's going to be up to you to get the men back to the fort, Yabo.
Yes, sir.
Where they keep guns in the fighting fort?
Where?
Where they keep guns in the fighting fort?
Under church, by the big window.
That side.
You take men.
Attack the gate by the bridge.
I go to other side and get guns.
More shells out of the arsenal!
Mac!
Mac!
Hang on!
Mac.
Get me some more ammunition.
Go on.
Now, we attack on all sides.
You go by river road.
You go by river.
You go by lagoon.
And I go by bridge.
What are you standing there for?
Get back to your places!
Get back into position!
Get back into position there.
Yabo, keep them all together!
Tenyente! They are coming!
They are coming up the river!
Tenyente, they are coming in the lagoon!
Where's the dynamite?
There isn't any.
Keep your positions!
Use your guns as clubs!
Yabo, keep the men together.
Ready!
Aim!
Fire!
Yabo! Yabo!
Alipang! The one in black. Get him!
- Steve.
- Bill.
I wish you could have seen it.
Seen it? I can feel it. It was wonderful.
How's Linda?
Dad!
Thank you.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
We, who are about to live, salute you.
The 52 nations which, under the name CIDALC,

I ACCUSE
A TRAGIC PORTRAIT
OF MODERN TIMES
I dedicate this film to the dead of the next war,
who will no doubt watch it sceptically
without recognising that it is about them.
Abel Gance
God damn it! Have you quite finished playing tennis with my carcass?
They've spotted us, lads!
Do not drink.
Contaminated water.
I've had it!
- Oh, a dove!
- What luck!
- We'll draw lots.
- It's mine!
Greedy pig!
Are you gonna scoff the lot?
Want some peas with it?
Anyone who touches it will have me to deal with!
Don't be stupid, Jean. You'll win.
Hey, pal.
- Are you from the Second?
- What of it?
- Do you know Jean Diaz?
- Yes, the trench cleaner.
Where is he?
There he is, burying the dove of peace.
- Who's that?
- François Laurin, the husband.
He found Jean Diaz writing letters to his wife.
- To Laurin's wife?
- Yes. Look at them.
Laurin's a hard man.
They'll kill one another.
How's the barometer?
The weather's fine.
It's stopped raining.
I don't understand.
What, that the war's become a private duel between us now?
Whichever one of us survives earns the right to love Edith.
Your attitude doesn't surprise me.
It's only natural.
All the same, I'm glad you didn't become Edith's lover.
You think your wife has remained faithful?
Yes, I think so.
That's why I wanted to make up with you.
Won't you shake my hand, Jean?
Yes.
As long as you don't forget...
That you still love Edith?
Yes.
No.
I can never forget that.
But I do acknowledge that when you fell in love with her, it wasn't your fault.
It's good of you to admit that.
I was very hard on Edith, brutal even.
She'd be happier with you.
Don't say that.
I say it because I think it, because it's the truth.
Listen, Jean.
Edith is my wife.
Isn't it natural that I should want to keep her?
Yes.
You said yes?
Yes.
That's part of our duel.
There.
That's all I wanted to say.
Goodbye, Jean.
Goodbye, François.
I hope now we can be friends when this is over.
Sure, why not?
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
It was bothering me, it's true.
I thought you two were going to kill one another.
Forgive me for listening.
All that talk about a duel, as you call it.
No good will come of it.
Even if you come out of it alive.
Suppose François is killed.
Well?
It would be a hundred times more dangerous for you.
Then his wife will really begin to feel sorry.
And so?
Well, then, with your character... you won't want to profit from his death.
Aren't you listening?
No, it's not that.
I'm watching.
Misfortune always looks the same.
You're not wrong there.
The cemetery is turning people away every evening.
Let's go and have a drink at Flo's.
Our brave boys at the front
What is their greatest want?
A woman
A woman
What kindly measure
Would give them pleasure?
A woman
A woman
Bastards!
Right now the thing they need
Is a saintly gift indeed
A woman
A woman
And so we pray with each day's end
The good Lord for us to send
A woman
A woman!
Cheer up, son.
Cheer up? We're sick of it.
We've been at it for four years.
That's 50 months!
What would you have done in the Hundred Years' War?
She's eyeing up Gilles Tenant!
Romeo and Juliet!
- Flo!
- Coming boys!
It makes me sad when you sing.
It's as if you were helping us to die.
Silly boy.
You're just sad because you're off to Verdun tomorrow.
It's not the first time, is it?
When it's the last, you won't be here to make light of it.
Douaumont?
That's nothing compared to Côte 304, and you know it!
Hands off!
It makes no odds.
The boys from the 15th just got back.
They say it's quiet at the moment.
You're lying.
Just listen to how quiet it is!
Don't worry, you know
I'll bring you good luck.
That Flo's a looker,
I really fancy her!
- Cut it out!
- It's true.
How's it going, Staminal?
We'd be OK if it weren't for the fact that each week
12 men must go out on patrol.
Ah, yes, the famous patrol.
Yes.
And they never come back?
Never.
It's been going on for 10 weeks.
10 times 12, that's...
92, isn't it?
- No, that makes 102.
- What?
I'll bet they were taken prisoner.
Prisoners?
The worms are eating them!
Talking of which, where's my grub?
He came back, though.
Jean Diaz, the death dodger.
He never comes here.
Who is he?
A former officer and interpreter.
He was retired and came back as an ordinary trooper.
He's a strange fellow, but I like him because he's brave.
And stubborn!
Want some?
No. See you later.
Shit!
That was a close one.
Look at that crater!
Let's get out of here, boys!
Flo! What do we owe you?
- I'll see you when you get back.
- Get back?
How does that new song go again?
Our brave boys at the front
What is their greatest want?
A woman
A woman
When they've eaten their ration
What arouses their passion?
A woman
A woman
And then to calm their nerves
What dessert must we serve?
A woman
A woman
To give in to her charms
And spend a moment in her arms
A woman
A woman
Goodbye, Flo!
That was lovely.
They're leaving happy, Miss Flo!
Goodbye.
What is it?
Nothing.
They've separated us, boys.
They're going to call the roll for leave.
I'm afraid it's for the patrol.
Don't be ridiculous.
They'd never dare send out another.
What's the point?
No one ever comes back.
They promised it was all over.
The chaplain's coming with us, so I reckon it's a burial party.
Maybe a guard of honour for the Generalissimo!
Maybe they're handing out decorations!
Boys, the Captain's here.
My friends, the 12 of you have been chosen by lots for the patrol of the Ravin des Dames.
I'd do anything to prevent your being sent.
You know, boys,
I got it wrong.
10 times 12 is 120.
With us that makes 132.
Why us?
I'd like to have watched the drawing of those lots.
And you, my young friend?
I have a request, Captain: if they find me, bury me in the square next to Flo's café.
And you, my friend?
Nothing, Captain.
No requests, Morat?
I hope they have enough trees to make crosses.
And you, Liotard?
I'm a machine for killing, not for talking.
And you, son?
Anything to reproach yourself for?
I haven't had much chance to sin these past four years.
To think I've made it this far only for this to happen.
It's hard.
Grisard?
I should have listened to my father and worked in a factory.
See you at dusk, then.
In one hour's time.
Look, there's Gilles Tenant crying in his corner.
Rémusad can't even light his pipe.
He's got three kids and an old mother.
And Damasot, talking to himself.
Don't make so much noise.
I'm trying to write!
That's the seventh letter to his wife!
What's it to you, rat face?
I'm so sick of this!
You're not the only one!
I'm sick of it.
It's a miracle I'm here.
As you're the only one who's ever come back, maybe you have some advice for my men.
If you like I'll tell them
I got into the pillbox.
I took this angel's hand to prove it.
There's a pillbox in the crypt of the church?
Yes.
Can I speak frankly, as an ex-officer?
Yes, of course.
Well...
I doubt a single one will return from this patrol.
The Major thinks the Germans are digging out of the pillbox, hence all these patrols.
Of course! Why else?
I give you my word that three days ago there were no tunnelling works.
I hear you.
I'll tell you anyway.
To reach us, it would take more than three days of tunnelling.
So it's pointless sending out another patrol today.
You're right.
I'll let the Staff Officer know.
He's a nice guy.
He's bound to understand.
- I'll send for you when he's here.
- Great.
In the meantime, will you have a word with my men?
- The ones who are leaving?
- Yes.
The fact that you came back from your patrol would encourage them and you'd be doing me a favour.
- Is François Laurin one of them?
- Yes. You two made up today, didn't you?
Only you can give them hope.
You can't deny them that.
No, I can't.
I brought this back from the pillbox a week ago, and here I am, talking to you, so...
Maybe the patrol won't go out.
Tell us again what the Captain said.
He said he'd send word to Headquarters.
Do you think they'll have second thoughts?
I don't know. I hope so.
You're just saying that to cheer us up.
You know we'll be going anyway.
No one really knows.
It's absolutely certain.
Leave him alone.
It's me Jean came to see.
Not especially.
Three quarters of an hour to go.
The worst thing about this war is the waiting.
For me it's the cold.
I feel as if I've been cold non-stop for the past three years.
You're forgetting the vermin.
The most disgusting thing about this last war is the filthy living conditions.
That I'll never forget!
Hey, Morat. You said "this last war".
- Was that a joke?
- Not at all.
Well, that's good, because I've got children.
So have I.
So what?
If I thought they'd have to endure what we've endured,
I'd go and blow my brains out.
You're a good fellow.
Not really. I'm just saying what we all think, no?
- Of course.
- Sure.
You said the one thing that is certain.
And I mean it.
Really certain.
What's that?
We are fighting the last of all wars.
- Do you really believe that, Jean?
- Yes, François.
I hope so too, but I think you're expecting too much.
No, he's right.
We won't all die.
Some will return home.
That's the reality.
As long as some survive, there'll never be another war.
Yes, but what about afterwards?
Afterwards?
There will never be another war,
I'm telling you.
- Explain yourself.
- Why?
Why?
Because of an idea I have.
I swear it.
It's a nice idea, but it's wishful thinking.
No, it's the truth.
I swear it.
Yes, well... all I know is, the war will soon be over.
I'd have been so happy, so happy to hear the ceasefire.
What I regret the most is never having kissed my youngest.
You know they wouldn't send a patrol unless it was necessary.
I get someone to call him.
You must speak to your Colonel.
If you like, but it won't do any good.
For God's sake!
The Germans haven't had time to dig a tunnel in three days.
- Yes, I'll tell him that.
- You'll do all you can to convince him?
Yes, I promise.
Listen, they want to speak to you.
- Listen, François...
- Leave me alone.
- Shit! Shit! Shit!
- Shut up!
I've got a right to speak!
Let them talk.
- Let me...
- No, don't worry.
I've been here a long time.
Here.
Take these letters.
They're all for Edith.
Listen, see that she gets one every two weeks.
I don't want her to know what's happened until the last possible moment.
- All right.
- Thank you.
You see, she'll read things in those letters, things I could never express while I was alive.
Excuse me.
I'd like to make sure this gets to my wife.
- Will you take care of it?
- Yes, of course.
What makes it so heavy?
Five gold coins.
Louise will need them.
Do you have any children?
Yes.
Four.
Did you tell the Captain?
What good would that do?
We were chosen by lots.
I can't help wondering what will happen to Hélène and Edith.
I can't make any promises,
François, but if I make it back...
Yes, you'll take care of my wife and my daughter.
Of course you will!
Why didn't I think of it sooner?
- That's a terrible thought.
- It's true, though!
- You still love Edith, don't you?
- Yes.
Then you'd be a saint if you weren't pleased that I'll soon be out of your way.
I'm no saint and I'm not pleased in the least.
All the same, you came to ask my permission to marry Edith.
No, I simply came to see you, to help you.
I felt I had to come now that we're friends again.
- We're not friends.
- You said we were.
That was before I knew you'd get my wife so easily.
I thought I'd make it home to defend myself.
- You talk as if I'm the enemy.
- You always have been, always will be.
- No.
- Yes!
It will be even harder for me, because I'll die thinking of you two and hating you.
Calm down, François.
- Nothing will calm me down.
- It will.
Just listen to me.
And look at me.
I swear to you...
Do you hear?
I swear to you that Edith will never mean anything to me.
Well? Are they going?
Yes.
What? The Colonel says they must?
No. He was away on urgent business.
- Then I don't get it.
- What?
You're free to stop them.
I don't have the authority.
I'm not free to decide.
When I get an order
I must carry it out.
What you're doing is despicable!
There are certain things even frontline officers don't understand.
Such as why to send a patrol to certain death?
You bet I don't understand that.
You think it's pointless?
You're wrong.
- Really?
- Yes.
If the enemy didn't know we were targeting the pillbox, they'd put their sappers in there.
Take it upon yourself to stop the patrol.
I can't believe you'd ask such a thing.
You know my duty prevents me.
Goodbye, old chap.
By the way, lads, if things get tough, to assemble the patrol... three taps on the helmet.
- Got it?
- Yes.
Your whistling gets on our nerves!
Stop whinging.
One, two, three...
Bastards!
Sons of bitches!
That was close.
380. We're off to a good start.
Do you understand?
Send one every two weeks.
Right.
And give this one to Damasot.
Why can't you give it to him?
It's a long story.
Listen.
Well?
I told him all that.
He telephoned the staff officer and insisted it was urgent.
And he wouldn't even see me?
No.
What's his name?
Henri Chimay.
Henri Chimay?
That's a name I'll never forget.
If he had any courage, he wouldn't have phoned.
He'd have stopped the patrol going himself.
You know that's impossible.
I can assure you, he's a brave man.
I was in Champagne with him.
What is it?
There's a lull, Captain.
The patrol can go.
Right.
I'll go and see them at once.
- Let them know.
- Yes, Captain.
Listen.
I want to leave with this patrol.
I'll take Damasot's place.
He's got four kids.
You can't refuse me.
You're not one of my men.
Just let the company know.
- You might be punished.
- So what? We'll never return.
You have no right!
I'm making it my right.
Good God!
DRINKING WATER
No, I can't.
Damasot, you're not going.
Jean Diaz asked to take your place because you have four children.
Thank you, old chap.
Thank you.
What about me, Captain?
I have nothing to say, my friends.
You have your orders.
Do your best.
You're mad!
- Haven't you done enough?
- Leave me alone.
It seems to me that we must take advantage of this lull and leave.
Here, son. Give this to Flo.
Over here!
Help me!
Help me!
Get me out of here!
Over here!
For God's sake help me!
”I'd' have been so happy, so happy to hear the ceasefire.”
Flo.
It's the armistice!
Victory!
Victory!
Long live the people!
Captain?
It's the patrol.
It's over! It's over!
The last...
The last to die in the war.
- Rémusad?
- Dead.
- Ligny?
- Dead.
- Staminal?
- Dead.
Jean Diaz?
Dead.
Langlade?
Dead.
- Liotard?
- Dead.
- Grisard?
- Dead.
- Laragne?
- Dead.
Tell me Gilles Tenant isn't dead and that he'll come back!
He'll come back, Flo.
No one found him.
Who'd have thought?
Let them be buried here, in the village that they defended unstintingly for 16 months.
It was their wish.
It's my final duty.
Bugler, sound the call.
- Evacuate?
- No point.
Let us make the sign of the cross together.
Keep your voices down!
He wants to be buried with his comrades.
Farewell, Staminal.
Someone cried out!
Hear that?
Jean!
He's not dead! Quick!
Take the other end! Quick!
Major, this one had a lucky escape.
He was about to be buried.
Of course he'll live.
Well?
Rest assured he'll pull through.
What about...
The other one?
I'll be back in a moment.
This one must be moved at once.
Yes, sir.
I'm losing you.
To arms, citizens
Form your battalions
March!
March!
Let impure blood
Water our furrows
To arms, citizens
Form your battalions
March!
March!
Let impure blood
Water our furrows!
Why isn't Daddy here?
Because he's at war.
I'll ask him to bring me back a gun.
A gun? What for?
So I can kill the war.
Why have you put me in a black dress?
We put black dresses on little girls whose fathers are at war.
All those lies!
I don't understand.
He wanted all those letters to be sent to you after his death.
That was even more cruel.
I answered every day!
That's probably what he wanted.
You should have told me.
There's no need to be so upset, Edith.
We did everything François wanted.
He thought of nothing else throughout the war.
Was he so sure he'd die when he wrote them?
Very sure.
Do you know how he died?
Yes, I do.
- Not on the last day of the war?
- No, long before.
Oh, Jean...
Here, look.
There was this little village full of flowers where not a single... stone remains.
Has Daddy gone far away?
Yes, sweetheart.
Daddy has gone far away.
GLASSWORKS
RESEARCH LABORATORY
My dear Jean,
I love you more for respecting my mourning.
Months have passed and my heart beats again.
Why are you avoiding me?
I cannot live without...
Don't you love me anymore?
No, Edith.
I don't love you.
It can't be true. I don't believe it.
There's something else.
Is there... someone else?
I can't say.
Just answer me honestly.
It's easy to say yes.
If you say yes,
I won't trouble you anymore.
Is there... another woman?
No.
I couldn't hope for a better answer.
I promise that now...
I shall stop trying to find out what separates you from me.
Yes, but...
I can't stay here in Saint-Paul-de-Vence.
I shall have to leave now.
Perhaps it's better that way, Jean.
Did you rent a place near Douaumont?
Yes.
But that's where you were wounded the last time.
Not far from there.
I can see it from the window.
Do you think it's good for you to be in that atmosphere?
Not really, but that's where my life stopped.
That's where I must go.
We must let him go, Doctor.
Jean is too unhappy here.
As long as the glassworks are mine, you can continue your research.
Thank you for trusting me.
I won't let you down.
Take your time, Jean.
You'll be paid regularly.
- You're too kind.
- Nonsense.
- But you'll come back sometimes?
- Of course.
Anything special you'd like me to do?
Yes.
I'd like you to let me know at once if Helene or her mother gets sick.
- Fine.
- Passengers for Nice.
Mummy, what's the matter?
GALLWITZ SHELTER
JEAN DIAZ'S WORKSHOP
This evening, for the first time,
I have come back to you, my friends.
My 11 comrades, killed on the last day.
I know you can see and hear me.
Remember I said this war would be the last and your sacrifices would not be in vain?
Well...
Listen to me.
I live only for this promise.
Only to fulfil that promise.
I am just a poor man, alone, just a shadow, nothing.
But I have so much of your strength in me.
All the strength of the dead.
I shall be your voice and your hands so that the war of tomorrow may be stopped.
I swear it.
I who knew you and loved you.
I who love you.
Happy birthday, Jean...
Mummy, I'd love
Mr Jean to be my daddy.
What about you, Mummy?
You shouldn't say things like that.
Naughty girl!
What will Mr Jean say?
- Letters from Mr Jean.
- Go and get them, Hélène.
Naughty girl!
What will Jean think?
Nosey girl!
- Hélène!
- Coming!
Flowers from Mr Jean.
Jean must have the radio on now too.
I'm sure he has, Mother.
I want you to understand, Hélène.
I can't express it any better.
Jean is an intelligent and brave man but above all, he has a beautiful soul.
You're always thinking about him, Mother.
Why do you say that?
Because I think of him all the time too.
You love him, don't you?
If that were true, would it hurt you?
Terribly.
Darling Mother.
But I mustn't spoil your plans in any way.
But we haven't made any plans yet.
Listen, Mother...
If Jean still loves you, I must know.
You can't be jealous of the few looks, the few words
I've received in 20 years, and then only reluctantly.
No.
You're the only one he loves.
I must confess, Mother, even to make myself happy,
I wouldn't want to cause you sorrow.
I'm sorry, darling.
I'm being unjust.
This love between Jean and you was caused by me.
I spoke about him all the time.
I used you to get him to come here.
I loved knowing he was interested in my daughter.
It allowed me to see him and hear him from time to time.
Then one day in the garden, I remember,
I noticed him looking at you in a certain way.
I can tell you now...
I considered killing myself that evening.
Mother!
Don't worry, darling.
I'll never be so weak again.
Due to the death of Mr Pierrefond
the factory will remain closed until further notice.
I trust that you will take over the factory as Mr Pierrefond wished.
His adoptive son, Henri Chimay, knows nothing of this industry.
"Henri Chimay?
"That's a name I won't forget."
The balance sheet for the past six months.
You've done a splendid job.
I'm amazed you've succeeded so quickly.
The Minister is on the telephone.
- Tell him to call back later.
- Yes, sir.
Thank you.
He's to call back later.
We'll have to build new workshops.
The land has been bought.
I'll show you.
- Why?
- What do you mean, why?
These glassworks belong to you as much as me.
- That's not true.
- But without your methods...
No, I'm just an amateur.
If it weren't for you, the glassworks would still be as they were.
Then I'm pleased I came.
And became your friend.
That's not important, I assure you.
But I'm not wrong, am I?
I've always thought of you as my friend.
What's the matter?
Have you something against me?
No, no. Excuse me.
I must get back to work.
Hello?
The meeting tomorrow?
No, it won't be a political meeting.
I appreciate your coming, Minister.
You're exaggerating my influence.
You're not going up, Mr Diaz?
This is a real triumph for Mr Chimay.
You're not interested in politics.
Freedom is a prerogative of the Republic!
Armaments are indispensable to a free and strong democracy.
Progress has made us what we are and we shall build the future in spite of everything!
"Resist and persevere" is our motto.
Let "victory" be our rallying cry!
- Thank you for coming.
- You were wonderful.
A most excellent speaker.
Truly.
Were you waiting for me?
Why didn't you come up?
- I'm not interested in politics.
- Yes, I know.
Anyway, I think you're all wrong.
You're heading for disaster.
- My friend Jean Diaz begs to differ.
- Right.
Jean Diaz never argues.
No, he accuses.
You're right. I do accuse.
- But whom do you accuse?
- Not those who won the war?
No, I don't accuse those who won.
I accuse yesterday's war of creating today's Europe.
And I accuse tomorrow's war of preparing its destruction.
Tomorrow's war?
I accuse mankind of failing to learn any lessons from the last catastrophe, of waiting with folded arms for the next war.
I accuse the careless, the short-sighted, the egotists of having allowed Europe to be divided instead of building a permanent alliance.
And I accuse the men of today not only of failing to understand, but of laughing when reminded of the most beautiful expression on earth:
"Love one another."
And I accuse you same men of ignoring the voices of the millions who died in the war who have cried out to you these past 20 years:
"Stop!
"You're taking the same terrible path!"
We haven't chosen the same path.
The idea of a new war horrifies us.
But in order to survive we must struggle and overcome.
No!
In order to live... we must...
We must love.
Well said!
But that doesn't change the fact that France needs a leader.
Yes.
But the world seeks a heart.
Go.
Go and find the doctor.
- He's in the garden.
- He's not, he's at the hospital.
He is here.
Go to him.
I assure you he's here.
One day, 18 years ago,
François asked you to go into the garden because I was here.
I have just witnessed the exact same scene.
You've recreated yourself.
It's cruel to say it but Hélène is playing the part you once played.
She has your grace and your bearing.
Perhaps she will bring about the same drama.
Stay away from her.
If my love for Hélène pains you,
I'll say nothing to her.
Why do you love her?
I told you, she reminds me of you.
She is your reflection.
Don't say any more.
"I swear to you
"Edith will never mean anything to me."
But help me.
Help us!
François is watching us.
Thank you, Jean.
Thanks to those words,
I'll never stop loving Hélène.
But I love you too!
- Flo, another drink!
- Yes, Mr Gatineau.
Here, look at this.
Making proposals to the government!
You make me laugh.
You haven't a clue.
That's good.
Look, it's perfect.
It's striking.
It catches the eye.
Indeed.
- Many visitors today?
- Yes, three families.
Three families!
When I say three families,
I mean three women.
Yes, three women because... whole families don't bother coming anymore.
That's obvious.
I wonder what it is that keeps Flo here.
She likes to stay near the dead.
- And for dessert?
- An orange.
- Here. I thought you'd want that.
- Thank you.
- Mr Jean Diaz.
- Yes?
I've been meaning to speak to you.
- To me?
- Yes, but I didn't dare.
I'm off to see about my potatoes.
So long, old son.
In 1917 I was at Chattancourt.
Chattancourt?
You've heard of the Elephant Bar?
Sure, I went there often.
Then perhaps you remember Flo?
Yes, of course.
I'm Flo.
Forgive me.
And you live here, near the front?
Yes. I kept returning so I decided to stay.
You did so much good for the soldiers during the war.
Maybe you didn't realise.
Did you know Gilles Tenant?
An orphan.
He was in the same section as François Laurin.
Yes. He went out with the last patrol.
They never found him.
I'm still waiting for him.
Perhaps...
Perhaps, Flo.
I can't believe
I won't see him again.
Then you will see him again, Flo.
All my sad words must be boring you.
Far from it.
You're saying things I like to hear.
I wanted to say, it's not only because of Gilles that I came back here and can't drag myself away.
I knew too many of them, and they are still here.
You too... feel that they are still here.
I've found 42 of them whose voices I'm sure
I can remember.
The terrible thing is,
I can't forget their voices.
Perhaps it's because
I made them sing too often.
Yes, yes.
Anyway...
I wanted you to know there was someone else like you.
Someone like me...
Yes, someone who remembers.
I'm not staying.
The postman said you had received a letter from Jean.
Yes, here it is.
He speaks of his anti-war research.
He hopes it will succeed.
What a poet!
Does my interest in Jean surprise you?
I must admit it does.
He never writes more than 20 lines to me once a week.
That's strange.
- I thought...
- What?
No, I was going to say something silly.
Say it.
If you were waiting for my news,
I'd send you a letter in every post.
Then we are of the same mind.
DEATHS IN THE 1914-18 WAR
9 million dead, 17 million wounded
Flo?
Where did you spring from, Mr Jean?
I live here.
I was so afraid to come in.
Yes, I see. The scythe.
The grass here grows so high.
Is it true that there are passages leading to the cemetery?
Have you come to ask me something?
Only how you're getting on.
Well, I'm pleased, Flo.
I've done a lot of work.
And if I'm not mistaken, there won't be another.
Another what?
War.
If only that were true.
And yet they talk about it more and more often.
Yes.
- By the way, I must thank you.
- For what?
Because I was thinking only of my happiness.
I had almost forgotten about... them.
You've reminded me of my duty.
My Only duty.
What a quaint place.
It hasn't changed in 18 years.
It's Jean's wish.
His plans, formulas, inventions are scattered everywhere, as you can see.
Inventions for the Prevention of War by Jean Diaz
What a strange man.
You're suffering, Chimay.
Yes. I've decided to tell Hélène how I feel.
We both love her.
It's for her to choose.
What a drama that will be.
There's no other way.
I love her too much.

If I die during my research
please inform Edith Laurin in Saint-Paul-de-Vence.
Oh, my God!
The mud...
The mud on your face!
I'm afraid.
I can't stay in my house any longer.
What is it?
Your hair has turned completely white!
It's beyond all human understanding.
I beg you, Jean, to tell me what you do outside every night?
Never, since mankind has been on this earth, has anyone seen such a thing.
Explain yourself.
No.
I can't explain.
Touch me.
I'm speaking, aren't I?
I'm not mad, am I?
No.
My reason is intact?
Yes.
Then...it's not possible.
You must go tomorrow.
You can't stay here.
Yes, you're right.
It's too dangerous.
One shouldn't disturb the...
The what?
There they are.
No! Dear Jean!
No! No!
Don't go out there, Jean!
François!
Lagide?
- Gilles Tenant!
- Gilles Tenant?
Ligny?
Liotard!
Rémusad!
Come here!
You frightened me.
I almost succeeded.
Be quiet!
Edith, you have no idea.
It's beyond understanding.
20 years.
20 years I've been searching.
And I've found it.
Jean, come into the garden.
Hélène and Henri are waiting for you.
Give your mind a rest.
You've changed beyond recognition.
No.
I know very well what I'm saying.
Something has happened to me, something extraordinary.
So extraordinary... that I shall be unable to bear this fantastic secret for much longer.
But... if my health can withstand the tension I am experiencing
I'll be able to prevent another war.
I will prevent war.
Prevent war?
How?
That's a secret, between the earth and me.
I don't recognise my Jean.
- Your Jean?
- Our Jean if you prefer.
His work has been the ruin of him.
Did you see his face?
He didn't say a word to you.
I'm afraid for him.
You see, Hélène? I was right.
His concern for humanity has driven him mad.
- What about his secret?
- Come now.
That's just his utopian, poetic way of talking.
Add to that his war wound...
H's a pity.
A fine man like Jean.
So, how is Jean this evening?
He's overwrought, Doctor.
- Well, let's go and cheer him up.
- Yes, come on.
- There.
- I mentioned a walk in the garden.
Good idea.
Come on, let's go.
Well, Jean?
What about that walk?
Hélène's pretty, isn't she?
What do you mean?
Nothing more than what you think.
- Explain yourself. Why do you say that?
- No reason.
No reason.
Will you leave me alone with the doctor?
But...
I beg of you. Please.
My friend, I'm going to need you.
Of course. Speak, Jean.
I'll do anything you like.
Thank you.
I shall soon be leaving here.
I shall disappear forever.
And I would like you, once I have left, to pass on my final wishes to the two people I love the most:
Edith and Hélène.
I'll do that.
Why are you leaving?
Because...
Because the tragedy is now almost inevitable.
What tragedy?
The war.
Come now!
Surely you don't think so.
And you?
What do you think?
You're all blind to the facts.
The political horizon is darkening.
Squadrons are on the move.
War is on the way.
It's coming. I can feel it.
But I'll prevent it, my friend.
Yes, yes! I alone.
- I alone will stop it.
- Don't distress yourself...
I will stand in the way of this madness and I will stop it.
- I have the means.
- Jean, listen.
Alone!
I will be the one to stand up and shout, "No!
"It won't happen again,
"this stupidity,
"this abjectness,
"this monstrous absurdity.
"It won't happen again.
"The murder of millions of innocent people
"will not happen again.
"I, Jean Diaz,
"stand up and proclaim the sacred right to life.
- "I stand up and I accuse..."
- Jean!
"I accuse... I accuse...
- "I accuse..."
- Jean! What's wrong?
Hélène!
"I accuse!"
- "I accuse!"
- Hélène!
"I accuse!"
Jean! Jean!
"I accuse!"
Jean, stop!
Jean, Jean...
- Jean!
- Help me! Hold him!
- Jean!
- He's gone mad.
- Jean!
- It's his war wound, Hélène.
Put him on the bed.
I'll be right back.
Quick, drive to Nice and bring me Dartois, the great psychiatrist.
What are those doctors doing?
What did Professor Dartois say?
- He's examining him carefully.
- And the truth?
Jean has gone...
Do you think all the excitement he experienced today brought it on?
No.
A shell fragment in his head from the war has shifted.
- I...
- No.
- But I must.
- No. Stay here.
Later.
I can't believe it.
Am I mistaken or are you not bothered that he's gone mad?
- Mother!
- Hélène.
Oh, no.
He's ill, very ill.
Excuse me.
This is us in Venice.
Oh, look at Henri being a gondolier!
Jean didn't seem too upset about us leaving.
No. His poor head is still so removed from everything.
He was so used to seeing all three of us.
Yes, but he's dead to all human feelings now.
Why did you come back so soon?
- Was our absence so pleasant?
- Don't be silly, Helene.
How could we honeymoon when Europe is mobilising?
Oh, that's right. I'm so stupid.
But that's been going on for months so I thought...
There's Henri.
Off you go, darling.
What are you doing here?
Hello, darling.
Hello, my love.
EUROPE IN ARMS
Perhaps Jean could have prevented it.
Don't believe it, darling.
No one can prevent war.
It's inevitable.
We must face up to it and prepare for it with all our strength and faith.
We must see humanity as it is, and not as he wanted it to be or as it should be.
I have work to do, my dear.
This morning's news is not good.
Sir, you're speaking in Angoulême tomorrow,
Marseille on Monday,
Nancy on Saturday and tonight at the Vél d'Hiv to celebrate our party having two million members.
Yes, I know. Thank you.
Yes, all the precautions are in place.
An aerial attack?
Your attention, please.
The news worsens by the minute.
The government asks the people of Paris
to remain calm and disciplined.
Verdun.
Douaumont.
Fleury.
François!
Edith.
Edith.
WAR INEVITABLE
Ultimatum deadline passed
Read all about it!
Special edition!
Paris-Soir, special edition!
Special edition!
Negotiations fail!
Here is an announcement by the Minister for War:
The forces of evil are gathering.
Dark storm clouds are upon us.
The grave question of the day is: how do we prevent these evil forces
from spreading throughout Europe?
Hello?
Hello.
- Is this directory inquiries?
- Speaking.
Can you tell me where I'm calling from?
Which town?
Yes, yes. I want to know the name of the town I'm calling from.
This is no time for stupid jokes!
A LEADER: HENRI CHIMAY
It is better to reveal one's strength than to have to use it.
Henri Chimay has given his country
the magnificent invention of steel-glass armour.
Not only has it provided France with its best arms defence...
TO HENRI CHIMAY
FROM A GRATEFUL NATION
Edith!
When I think of the catastrophe that is about to strike the world,
I can't bear to be away from you.
You must remain calm, my dear.
Maybe I'm horribly selfish, but I don't want anything to ruin my happiness.
The war will do just that.
Strange that no one knew where and when he was killed.
They did.
Jean knew, I think, but he refused to say.
I see.
First my father and now they want to take my husband.
No, no.
Don't call anyone.
Don't be afraid of me.
I've just woken up.
And I know...
I know war is here.
And I know they've stolen my formula for steel-glass to make a fortune and to wage war.
I know I've been betrayed.
I've seen Hélène in Henri's arms.
I know they're married!
Why?
Why did you allow it?
Jean, calm down.
Yes, it's true.
Well, I shall destroy their love.
I shall annihilate it with a single word.
What will you do, Jean?
I shall say one word to link Henri Chimay to a point on this map.
No, Jean, I beg of you!
If you do that, you'll kill me and destroy Hélène's happiness.
I don't care what you do to me, but spare her, I beg you.
Spare my daughter.
They're coming.
Henri must be with her.
She's my daughter.
I'm begging you.
Do you think he's unwell?
He's paler than usual.
He looks more unhappy.
Mother, why are you trembling?
You're scaring me.
Please don't get so upset!
Mother!
I must get dressed so I can see the Minister with Henri.
I'll fetch the doctor.
Call me straight away.
And get my things ready.
His things?
Yes, he's leaving.
He just decided.
War is certain now.
Special edition!
Negotiations break down!
Come with me, Hélène.
See you later, Mother.
They thank you, Jean.
I thank you.
No.
It's better like this.
I have escaped the risk of happiness.
I'm sorry for all the harm we have done you.
I'm the one who must ask forgiveness.
When I awoke, I could only find words of anger and hatred.
And yet...
I should have been... in awe of the marvellous discovery I made.
What discovery?
That there exists a woman in the world who is capable of loving a madman.
WAR INEVITABLE
Read all about it!
Negotiations break down!
Europe is mobilising!
Negotiations break down!
Read Paris-Soir
We shall never meet again, Edith.
I'm leaving.
Now and forever.
Oh, no, no, no!
Be brave.
You must understand that I cannot stay here.
You can tell people it was madness or an accident, so long as Hélène doesn't suffer.
Besides...
I have something to do there.
For the war?
Before the war.
You remember what I told you one evening?
- I must prevent war.
- I'm afraid you're losing it again.
No,no,no.
It's not my ideas that drove me mad.
It's one tiny piece of the war that has stayed with me, here.
Farewell.
Our first... and last kiss, Edith.
For a man like you to be so unhappy is so unfair.
To make unhappiness bearable we must try to give happiness to others.
I only hope I'm in time.
What are you going to do, Jean?
I'm going to keep my promise to the dead of Verdun.
I have come.
Did I understand your orders?
Am I the chosen one?
I am ready.
Is this the moment?
I will comply.
François Laurin and the rest, my friends.
I have returned to you.
I need you.
Listen.
Your sacrifice was in vain.
The living want to go to war again.
But I, your spirit and your will on earth,
I oppose it.
This is the hour of our pact.
Help me, my friends, my brothers, my comrades.
One of your own is speaking to you, crying out to you.
Men are going to war again.
I'm calling for help.
You must hear me.
You must!
I'm calling you!
I'm calling you!
I'm calling you!
I'm calling you!
I'm calling you!
Dead of Verdun, arise!
I'm calling you!
You, soldier laid to eternal rest by war,
I'm calling you!
IN MEMORY
OF THE FRENCH SOLDIERS
WHO SLEEP STANDING UP,
A GUN IN THEIR HAND
Arise!
German soldiers of the Great War, arise!
I summon you!
Why are you drawing the curtains?
I don't want to see those crosses moving.
He's had too much red wine!
I haven't touched a drop!
Just now I saw...
Stop it! You're all mad.
We can't all be mad.
It's impossible.
And why not?
They call it... What was it?
Collective hallucination.
It can happen.
I haven't seen or heard anything.
You're drinking because you're scared.
Me, scared? I'm off.
Will you come with me, lads?
Let's go.
After you.
The dead of Mort-Homme, arise!
I'm calling you!
I can't understand it.
It's going from dark to light and back again every minute.
I've never seen a sky like it.
If the animals are scared something must be wrong.
There's gonna be a squall.
It smells of sulphur!
Gabriel!
Gabriel, listen to me.
All the crosses have disappeared.
You're crazy!
I swear, Gabriel, all the crosses have disappeared.
It's the storm.
We're upset by the war.
We're going.
Everyone's leaving.
- Where to?
- I don't know but let's go.
This whole place is coming down.
Shh, listen.
Look!
There he is.
Well?
I don't get it. Nobody can get through.
There's an awful traffic jam.
- What are people saying?
- It's all nonsense, ghost stories.
There's fear in the air.
- What about the war?
- War? It's been declared, apparently.
I'm calling you!
Sailors of all the seas killed in the war,
I'm calling you!
Airmen of all the skies killed in the war,
I'm calling you!
Artillerymen, infantrymen, cavalry of all countries killed in the war,
I'm calling you!
My 12 million comrades killed in the war, upon whom men, blind and deaf, have walked for 20 years, arise, all of you!
The living want to go to war again.
I'm calling you!
I'm calling you!
Arise!
François!
Gilles Tenant!
TO THE 10,000 DEAD HEROES
WHOSE BLOOD SOAKS THIS EARTH
Come on!
No! It can't be true!
Dead men walking!
What a joke!
Here he is.
Tell him what you saw.
Well?
What was that about the dead?
I saw them!
With my own eyes!
They're coming from everywhere.
Thousands of them, hundreds of thousands.
German, Italians, Russians.
Dead from every country.
They're going in all directions.
It's as if they were searching for their country, their village, their town.
It's enough to drive you mad!
It's the enemy.
War has broken out.
They're pulling a big hoax on us.
It's the enemy dressed as ghosts.
We must hold our nerve and shoot them as they pass.
It's no use trying to lead us on with your tall stories.
The war is behind this.
In France we believe our own eyes.
I'll believe it when I see it.
He's right.
They're coming! They're coming!
I just went to the cemetery.
I saw them!
Take a good look at them
and let the desire to fight
be forever quelled in you.
Fill your eyes
with this horror
and let the weapons fall from your hands.
Operations suspended!
Don't talk nonsense!
Panic?
That's a good one!
Hello? Hello?
Call HQ right away.
They're not answering, sir.
I'm calling you!
Rapid Force 207 stopped in their tracks?
Panic-stricken soldiers?
Have we been betrayed?
All continental trains have been stopped.
The most amazing rumours abound.
- It's incomprehensible.
- During mobilisation?
Hello? Hello?
TERROR IMMOBILISES EUROPE
That's impossible!
ALL THE DEAD HAVE RISEN
FROM THEIR GRAVES
I'm calling you!
There are moments in history when a terrible blow, an upheaval that shakes society to its bones, strikes on all fronts.
Such a moment is upon us.
The dead remained in our villages, in our fields, all around us, within us, waiting for the living to act
as we are doing right now!
The abolition of war,
of all wars!
As a result of deliberations by the Universal Assembly war is formally abolished.
Immediate disarmament has been unanimously declared.
War is dead!
The world is renewed!
This film, made in 1938, won the SDN gold medal in 1939
and America's prestigious four-star award in 1940.
It was shown in France a few months before the war.
Its success is irrefutable evidence
that the French championed universal peace
and exercised their right to counter violence and tyranny.
Echoing a time when Nazism was lurking in our shadows,
the value of this work is that it was a premonition.
May it speed up the final victory of the "offensive for peace"
for which France has always been in the vanguard.
THE END
I'd like to make a bonfire of the whole blinking lot of them.
That's all they're good for.
Now, not even that.
They've been shot up so much they ain't worth the blinking petrol to set them afire.
Hold on, my lad. That's the king's property you're talking about.
- I know, sergeant, but look--
- I've looked. So has everybody else.
- What about it?
- Well, what about it?
Don't muck it.
Mend it and shut your mouth.
What about A Flight?
There's the major still stargazing.
That's what about it.
Headquarters, sir.
- Hello. 59th Squadron.
- Hello, Brand?
- Yes, this is Brand.
- What is the delay?
- Has A Flight returned yet?
- No, A Flight is not back yet.
They should be back before no w.
You send them out on a job and expect them back in no time at all.
- What?
- Can you hear me?
- We have a bad connection.
- Yes, yes, yes. I can hear you.
Next time w e'll get someone else.
We can't depend on you.
Oh, you'll get others to do it next time?
That'll be splendid.
- You do not seem to be giving cooperation.
- Yes, sir.
- After all, this is a w ar.
- We've done every job you dig up for us.
If our men can't do it, who can?
They're the finest in France--
If necessary, w e'll transfer you to a less important position.
Perhaps you can be taught to obey orders as they are given.
- Right.
- Is that clear?
Right, sir.
- Here.
- Yes, sir.
- Officious, overdressed brass hat.
- He thinks the 59th can't do it, huh?
The 59th can do anything he can think up.
You know what this place is?
It's a slaughterhouse and I'm the butcher.
No use calling your names, Brand.
- Duty is something you learn--
- Duty?
Do you realize how many men we've lost this last fortnight? Do you?
- Yes.
- Sixteen.
- More than a man a day.
- Yes.
And here's A Flight out on another rotten show.
Seven fine boys. Three of them first time out, first time over the lines.
If half of them get back, we'll be lucky.
It is a rotten job, Brand, but you mustn't let it get you.
They just got to say,
"Bombers after a bridge.
Go up and protect them."
You say, "Fine. Right. Cheerio."
You send up planes that have been shot to pieces, stuck together with spit and glue.
Do our boys argue? Do they complain?
Never. They just say, "Right." And go up.
- And go up and do it.
- They do.
Here they are.
That's one.
Five.
Five out of seven.
That's it.
- Hello, sergeant.
- Sir, you've been in something this time.
- Shrapnel?
- Yes. Nearly blew the ship over.
Yeah, my word-- Look here, sir, not 10 inches from your seat.
I needed that 10 inches, sergeant.
Oh, or every single ship--
- How'd you like it, Scott-o?
- All right. Are you intact?
- Yes, I think so.
- It was a hot one, wasn't it?
- Pretty warm.
- Who did we lose?
Blane and Machen.
Gonna lose Hollister, too, by the look of it.
Don't take it to heart too much, sir.
We all gotta go some time, sir.
- Poor kid. Machen was his best friend.
- Yeah.
Let's go up.
I was telling him we all gotta go.
Sorry, but he went quickly.
He didn't feel any pain.
- Bobby Machen.
- Come on, Court.
Come on.
- A good stiff brandy, Bott.
- Yes, sir.
- Who was it, Blane?
- Blane, yes.
- Machen?
- And Machen. Blane and Machen.
- Here you are, captain.
- Thank you, Bott.
- Have you seen Tim?
- Here a moment ago, sir.
- Mr. Blane and Mr. Machen, sir?
- That's right, Bott.
Too bad, sir.
And the first time over the lines.
Hollister, have a drink, old man?
No, no, I-- I couldn't. Thank you.
What he needs is a cup of tea and a nice lie down.
- A little headache powder--
- Quiet, you.
Just a suggestion.
You'd better come on down and have a drink.
Bobby Machen.
He didn't come back, Court.
He didn't come back.
It couldn't have been Bobs.
It was burning.
- No, it couldn't have been Bobs.
- Steady. Here.
- Drink?
- No, I don't want it.
Come on. Sit down.
Look, get that into you.
You'll feel better.
Come on, bottoms up.
Better?
Look. Poor old Bobby.
Look at the...
You can pack his things later.
They didn't even give him time to unpack.
You're from Harrogate, aren't you?
I used to have an aunt that lived there.
When I was a kid, they used to send me down to stay with her.
She was a funny old dame.
She used to have one of those great, enormous ear trumpets...
- Hollister.
- Oh, where's Courtney?
- He's up there with him.
- Oh, there you are.
The C.O. wants to see you.
He does? Right.
Step into another world and speak of lighter things?
- Very good idea.
- What'll you have?
Oh, the usual.
- Yes?
- We got to the bridge.
The bombers scored a direct hit and wiped it out.
They did?
We lost two men.
Blane and Machen.
Oh, you did?
Yes. That's all.
Wait a minute, Courtney.
You were responsible for those new men.
Yes, that's right.
I was responsible for those two men.
We ran into that Heinie nest on purpose.
We sent the Huns an engraved invitation to come over and meet us.
- Yes?
- We were outnumbered...
...and forced to fly low.
We had to fight our way out.
All right, suppose you did.
You could have been more cautious.
Cautious? You don't think I enjoyed losing those boys, do you?
Getting them burned up, all over France.
Sending them up in crates that should have been on the scrap heap months ago.
That's right. Now, tell me.
Tell me what's on your mind.
That I'm a murderer, I ought to give you better planes, men, fliers.
Say it, why don't you say it?
I'm not blaming anyone, Brand.
Why don't they chuck it?
It isn't funny anymore.
You know what it is? Brand is just about at the end of his tether.
His nerves are frayed out.
It's the responsibility.
Running the show on the ground when he'd infinitely rather be...
...up there in a plane himself, personally taking all the risks.
For a chap of Brand's temperament...
...a dangerous job is much easier than sending other fellows into danger.
He has nothing against Courtney.
He relies on him and he needs him.
- It's a funny war.
- No, not, not awfully.
I say, Courtney, do you remember Griggs in the 37th?
- Yes.
- He was killed the other day near Allensville.
- Pulled the wings off an FE.
- Was he? I hadn't heard.
I'll never forget Griggie's first solo flight.
He pancaked on top of that house...
...found himself upside down, looking into the girl's bedroom.
Yes. And she opened the window, and bashed him on the nose.
You're not gonna play that again, are you?
- It's a beautiful thing.
- It smells.
- Makes me want to cry.
- Yeah, me too.
Who did that?
You do not appreciate good music.
- Hey.
- Hey!
- Furniture, the furniture.
- I've gotta deal with these things--
- I'll take that.
- Please, no.
I told you you'd get hurt.
Now, why don't you sit down.
- Scotty. Scotty.
- Hey. Hey.
Come in.
Here, give it to me.
- Anything more, sir?
- No.
- Is there an E in "courageously," Brand?
- Courageously? Yes, of course.
I'm just sending a letter of sympathy to Mrs. Machen.
I'm puzzled over that word.
It has an unfamiliar look.
Unfamiliar?
Well, you've written it often enough.
Don't you think our letters of sympathy are becoming stereotyped?
I think I'll try and alter my prose style and humanize this one.
Well, no matter how you write it...
...it'll break her heart just the same.
Hooray! Hooray!
"Hurrah for the next man who dies."
Bluffing as though death doesn't mean anything. Trying to live for the moment...
...as if they didn't care a hang about going up tomorrow--
And never coming back.
Because they don't come back...
...do they?
No, but new ones keep coming up.
It goes on and on.
- Hello, yes, 59th.
- Brand?
- This is Brand.
- We have a nice job for you.
A good one this time. I understand.
Starting tomorro w you are to patrol every t w o hours starting at 5, ask Emma.
Wait a minute, sir.
Where do I get the men to do it?
- Are you there?
- Yes? Yes, sir.
- Replacements move up tonight.
- Replacements?
- Oh, they're on their way here now.
- They report before da w n.
- Yes, sir.
- Send the ne w men up.
- Yes.
- They've had enough training.
Have you get that?
Yes, of course, of course, sir.
Of course we'll do it.
If we must, we must.
- The 59th--
- Wait a minute, sir.
- If any of them get back from a job--
- Speak louder. I can't hear you.
If any of them get back from a job like that it'll be a miracle.
- Well, do the best you can.
- Yes, sir. All right.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
A new something nasty, huh?
Four new youngsters are on their way here.
They'll get their baptism in the morning with Courtney, who'll have to take them up.
Strange how a man like that can annoy you and yet...
...keep you worried to death about his safety.
It's not strange. It's the responsibility.
Haven't you seen a mother risk her life to save her child...
...then spanks it soundly for getting itself into danger? Of course you have.
When I order him to take up replacements again, you watch him.
He's going to stand there looking holes clean through me. You watch him.
Then he'll say, "Right." Like that.
- Right.
- Come along, sir. Let's get to it.
One day you'll find my plane--
Turn that thing off, will you, Esmund?
Thanks.
Quiet, lads. Attention there, please.
Orders for tomorrow morning.
A Flight.
Come on, there, hurry up.
Stand to attention.
A Flight on the early show over Baulay Sector.
We're making an advance
5:00 in the morning.
We're to patrol four kilometers behind to the enemy lines.
Strafe enemy reinforcements and munition convoys.
When the barrage starts, B Flight will cover our observation ships and artillery.
You'll take up the details amongst yourselves later on.
That's all. Thank you, gentlemen.
Good night.
Dismissed, gentlemen.
All right, what is it?
A Flight has only got five man.
- More replacements are on their way up.
- More replacements.
Yes. They'll be here first thing in the morning.
You're telling me that I'm expected to go out on a job like that...
- ...with two inexperienced men?
- Those are the orders.
Right.
- What?
- He said "right" just as you said he would.
I'm glad I'm not in A Flight.
Speaking of A Flight, where's Scotty?
He's down here.
Look at that. A couple of drinks and he goes out like a light.
Hey, Scotty, come on.
Time to tucky uppy now, Master Scott.
No sign of life. Wait a minute. Here.
Come along, Master Scott.
Time to tucky uppy.
Rain, rain, go a w ay, come back--
Come on.
- Up you come.
- Good morning, all.
- Say good night to the gentlemen now.
- Good night.
- That's right. Now to these gentlemen.
- Good night.
Good night, gentlemen. Alley-oop.
- Say good night to the gentlemen now.
- Good night.
Way to go, Scotty.
I've never heard of anyone like you.
Couple of drinks and you get as fuzzy as an owl.
You can't even keep your eyes open.
A couple of drinks?
Maybe four, maybe eight.
Who knows? Who cares? Who--?
Oh, here are my piebald pajamas.
I will now discard the lower half as usual.
I have spots in front of my eyes, Court.
- Well, what do you expect?
- Oh, these?
These were a going-away present from a little froufrou.
- Who, who?
- Froufrou.
Froufrou, froufrou. Froufrou was sweet.
What's the matter with you?
You're moping about something.
Oh, No. No, I was just thinking of Hollister.
It's pretty rough losing your best friend, isn't it?
- And he's gone.
- Go on, go to bed.
Machen, he was just a baby.
Couldn't have been older than that brother of yours.
Oh, little Donnie.
Oh, I hope this war is over by the time he gets out of school.
I haven't seen him in so long...
...I probably won't even recognize him when I do see him.
Court, I've got awful opening and shutting trouble with my head. Awful.
All that seems pretty far away, doesn't it?
Home and all that sort of thing.
My head seems awfully far away.
Imagine being at home now, peaceful and quiet.
Nothing to worry about.
Nothing to do except get up in the morning and laze around.
Marvelous.
Be able to know that you'll come back to your own bed at night.
- I'm sorry, sir.
- What's the time, sergeant?
Nearly 5:00, sir.
Dawn's just coming up.
- How's the weather?
- A bit cloudy, sir.
Where's that honey you're always talking about?
Honey you could have had right on this table.
Could I get anyone to help with them bees?
Up they'll go with their lives in their hands...
...but will one of them face a bee? No.
- It's a phenomena, sir. Phenomena.
- You're very good with the chicken.
How is it you could do nothing with bees?
I put a sack over me head as Mr. Scott recommended...
- ...and out I goes to be friendly--
- Scotty!
Out I goes to be friendly like,
I start buzzing back to them, like:
- How?
- Morning, Mr. Scott.
- Oh, good morning, sergeant.
- Good morning--
Oh, good morning, Mr. Scott.
It's a beautiful morning, Mr. Scott.
- Have an egg, Mr. Scott.
- Off from the nest, sir.
Coffee, Mr. Scott?
Don't stand there gaping.
Bring a couple of headache powders on toast. Mr. Scott, a little coffee.
What's that singing outside?
Replacements coming up, sir.
- Send them in.
- Very good, sir.
Court, have you ever seen mice on roller skates?
On bicycles, never on skates, old man.
- Morning, gentlemen.
- Good morning, sergeant.
Right this way, please, gentlemen.
That's all right. We'll look after your luggage. Just follow me.
- This way, gentlemen, please.
- Here they are.
Will you wait here, please, gentlemen?
- The replacements, sir.
- They get younger every day.
If this goes on much longer, they'll be coming in perambulators.
Come on, fix them up.
Gentlemen, Captain Courtney.
- Good morning, gents.
- Good morning, sir.
Russell, second lieutenant, sir, reporting from the pool for duty.
I see. How do you do, Russell?
Nice to have you with us.
- At ease. We don't have any formality.
- Thank you, sir.
- What's your name?
- Burt, sir.
Burt, eh? Burt what?
- Henry Burt.
- Oh, I see. How do you do?
- And you?
- Cleaver, sir.
Hello, Cleaver.
- And what's your name?
- Smythe, sir.
Hello, Smythe. Nice to have you with us.
- How many hours have you fellows had?
- I've had 18, sir.
Eighteen. And you?
- Thirteen, sir.
- Fifteen, sir.
- And how many have you had?
- Seven and a half, sir.
Seven and a half, eh?
I'll take Russell and Cleaver.
Get your things on.
- We're going to strafe trenches.
- Now, sir?
- You won't have time for breakfast.
- We've had it, sir.
- When do we go, sir?
- You'll go soon enough. Get some coffee.
- Morning, Hollister.
- Morning.
- Breakfast waiting for you, sir.
- I don't want breakfast.
- I think you better have some breakfast.
- I don't want any breakfast, thank you.
Have some coffee or breakfast or drinks or something.
- Kirby, bring some cups.
- Coming.
- Bott. The usual.
- Coming, sir.
Thank you.
Hollister, have a little breakfast.
- I'm just giving a little nourishment.
- I see.
I should explain that this little spotted number on my left...
...goes under the name of Scotty.
He's in A Flight.
- First today.
- Nice fellow, but he drinks too much.
Have some of this.
Come on, old chap.
Good luck.
Scotty.
Come on, now.
What are you doing asleep?
Come on, wake up.
Will you come or must I--?
- No, wait. Hold on.
- Come on. Come on then. Quick.
They can wait for me.
Go.
- There you are, sergeant.
- Yes, sir.
Russell and Cleaver will take four and five.
- This way.
- Don't forget to stick to my tail. Good luck.
You. You're an old hand now.
We're counting on you.
- Right, sir.
- Better watch him.
- Don't forget, you're protecting the tail.
- Yeah.
And watch yourself too, old man.
I don't want be left holding the bottle.
Thank you.
Is everything all right, Mac?
- Everything's all right, sir.
- Fine.
- Switch off.
- All right. Spin it.
Has the officer got any papers that might give information to the enemy?
No.
Has the officer got any papers that might give information to the enemy?
No.
Beat us to it just by a few more flying hours.
Lucky devils.
"And mother and I talk about how much you would love the old rock path now.
Last Sunday's rain brought up the best primroses."
Primroses.
"Jenny's had seven darling puppies."
Well, well, the rain seems to be accomplishing many blessings.
Think of it, Brand, a litter of seven.
"We'll have to give most of them away...
...because the milk rationing is very strict now...
...and we won't be able to buy enough for them."
Buy enough. Well, that's strange.
I always thought puppies were provided with private rations by their mother.
Even England's getting muddled with this war.
It'd be awfully nice if we had a dog around here in the mornings...
...to come in and cheer us up.
Here.
Come on, fella. Come on here.
Mind your muddy feet. Come on.
- What you doing?
- The dog.
Dog? What dog? Where?
No, I say it would be nice if we had a dog to come in here in the mornings...
...to sort of cheer us up, you know?
I thought it would be sort of cozy, you know?
Not Mr. Scott, sir?
There were two Boches after me.
Scotty was trying to help me.
Yes, Courtney?
We fought off the counterattack for an hour...
...and they found us.
We lost three men. Russell...
...Cleaver, Scott.
I'm sorry about Mr. Scott, sir.
Yes.
To him.
I'll drink to that.
To Scott-o.
Sleep tight.
What happened, Courtney?
Well...
We were strafing that convoy right after the first barrage...
...trying to get out under a cloud bank.
The Jerries came down on us like that:
Poor little Cleaver went first.
I don't think he even fired a shot.
Then Russell must have gone at about the same time. I didn't see.
Then Hollister.
Well?
- Something must have happened.
- He funked?
Yes, he did a bit. He got in a jam...
What?
And Scott-o went after him, to help him out.
Jerry got on his tail and shot him down out of patrol.
You sure?
Yes, I saw it.
It was right underneath me.
There was nothing I could do.
He had his tail surfaces all shot away.
He caught in a spin.
As he went down, he waved goodbye.
Where'd he'd go down?
I don't know, somewhere behind our lines.
I went after that Jerry bullheaded.
- Did you get him?
- No, I put a bullet in his motor.
He came down behind our lines somewhere.
Behind our lines?
Hi there, fellas. Turn that off, please.
No, no. Play it. Go ahead. Play it.
What's it matter?
You fellas don't appreciate good music.
Play it.
Maybe Scotty will hear it.
Funny if you really thought he could, wouldn't it?
He was wearing those bright piebald pajamas.
Remember, the one's with the spots?
It'll be funny if he shows up before the devil in those.
- Right, bring him in.
- Great fellow, Scotty.
You may send the car back.
Just wait here a moment, Henderson.
- What's all this?
- Pardon me, sir.
An artillery car brought in a German.
One moment, Captain Henderson.
- Who brought him down?
- They say the leader of A Flight.
That's you, Captain Courtney.
Steady, old fellow.
- Good morning, sir. I have my prisoner here.
- Good morning.
Hauptmann Von Mueller.
Hauptmann Von Mueller, Major Brand.
And Captain Courtney.
Phipps, tell him Courtney is the man that brought him down.
He says he's delighted to meet you.
Oh, sorry.
- So sorry?
- Sorry. Yeah. Will you have a drink?
Yes? Come on.
Bott, drinks.
What will you have, whiskey, cognac, champagne?
- Nothing but the best.
- Cognac.
- Cognac.
- Cognac.
Hello, Hollister. Have a drink.
- This is Hollister, Captain Von--
- Von Mueller.
Sorry.
- Sorry.
- We are sorry.
So...
He wants us drink to the day they'll blow us out of the skies.
0h, no, no, no. Can't do that.
Ask him if he'll drink a toast to the dead.
To the dead.
- That's very nice.
- Sorry.
No, no.
Thank you very much indeed.
Very nice. Thank you.
Do you think you could manage to say "the" next man "that" dies...
...not "zee" next man "zat" dies?
- The.
- The. That's it.
Very nice.
Very good.
You can laugh, joke with him, a man who murdered your best friend!
- He's dead! You know that, don't you?
- Shut up!
So is Blane. And Machen, my best friend!
They're dead!
They aren't coming back.
They aren't coming back anymore.
Shut up.
I believe you've forgotten Scott-o already.
Brandy, Bott.
He wants to know if Hollister flies.
Tell him yes.
Off the handle more times than not.
Brandy, Bott!
"Pack Up Your Troubles."
Scotty!
Scotty!
Where did--?
Where did you get the champagne?
I don't know.
You-- You--
You know, we thought you'd gone west.
Tell us, what happened?
Well, the last thing I remember was pancaking into a trench...
...and seeing my wings fold up.
Then I woke up with a bump on my head--
Feel it?
And a stretcher bearer pouring rum down my--
- You should have that rum.
- You didn't have any, did you?
Just a couple of drops.
I stopped on the way back...
...and I brought these.
Come on, open them up! Open them up!
Oh, what's that?
Oh, that's the man that brought you down.
- Who?
- Introduce him, will you, Phipps?
- What does he say?
- I don't know.
He wants him to have a drink.
Oh, drink! Drink. Bott, drinks!
Oh! Don't waste it!
- Didn't understand a word. Did you?
- I took German in school, but--
So did I, but I can't understand the way these foreigners speak it.
Thanks, old man.
Sir, there's a driver out here named Flaherty.
- He's waiting for you, sir.
- Tell him to wait.
- I've got a car and chauffeur outside.
- What?
Gonna take me on a personally conducted tour...
...of all the inns and taverns of France.
Wonderful. You wanna come, Fritzie?
Gentlemen, keep the war going, please.
We are going out to roll in a few gutters.
Bravo.
Flaherty! Flaherty, where's my horse?
Bring it on.
Boys, get comfy.
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Courtney! He can't go, he's a prisoner.
Oh, but he can sing.
Oh, well, goodbye, Fritzie. Goodbye.
Come on, Court, get in.
This is Mr. Courtney, Mr. Flaherty.
He's the best singer--
Best driver on the Western front.
- Coming up. Coming up.
- Get the captain to sing.
Oh, he's terrific.
- Bring him in. I want to talk to him.
- Yes, sir. Come.
Road hog!
I'm not disputing that.
Military police are for that purpose. What?
- You should put them under arrest.
- I do not think it's a good idea.
- Why not?
- Why?
Well, because I need them here, that's why.
- What? They did?
- Some girl brought a minister do w n here.
- She did?
- Wants to marry both of them.
The Frenchman? His sweetheart?
Put him do w n in a w ell.
- Oh, they did?
- They're on their w ay back.
Oh, they are? Why didn't you say so before?
I'll discipline them.
All right, thank you, Yes. Goodbye.
Drunk as lords and raising Cain, and you laugh, you old fool.
Well, really, you know, confidentially, Brand, I envy them.
Don't you? Now, tell the truth.
Apparently, they've put some French girl's sweetheart down a well or something.
If I didn't need them here,
I'd leave them to the military--
Wait a minute, there's B Flight.
More trouble. Come along.
This way, sir. Come along, sir.
- Squires, what happened?
- Von Richter has moved in across the lines.
- Von Richter?
- We ran into one flight and then another.
There was nothing we could do.
Suddenly, the air was full of them.
It is lucky to any of us got back.
They can really fly.
Many of them?
We were outnumbered four to one.
We didn't have a chance.
- Here. Now, take it easy.
- Yes, sir.
That's right. Get your tourniquet on there.
- What's wrong?
- Hello, Squires.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- How many men did you lose?
- Courtney, Von Richter's over there.
That's gonna make things lively as if it wasn't bad enough already.
- Who'd you lose, Squires?
- Well, Thornley and Murrell.
- Verdan and Hollister.
- Hollister?
- Four out of seven.
- Hollister. How did Hollister go?
- He was trying to help Thornley.
- He was?
- Yeah.
- I'm glad. Out like a man.
Get Captain Squires to the medical officer.
- Courtney, you'd better come with me.
- Can you get the m.o.? All right.
- Duck, cover!
- Enemy plane.
Stay where you are, sir.
- Look, Courtney, boots.
- Wait. Don't touch those.
- They're all right. Let's look at them.
- They're all right.
What's that?
"One pair of trench boots for the use of British flying officers.
You'll be safer on the ground.
Von Richter."
Give me those boots.
Give me those. I'll get that--
- I'll take care of these boots.
- Order.
Give me those boots, Courtney.
Now pay attention.
There are going to be no volunteer patrols.
Don't you realize these boots are a trick to get you up in the air?
None of you is going to commit suicide by going up alone.
Don't worry. You'll die soon enough.
But not a man leaves the ground without my orders. Understand?
- Yes, sir.
- Come along, Phipps.
Yes, sir.
About those boots, Court...
Yes, I was just thinking the same thing.
You can keep the boots. They don't fit.
Let her rip, Scott-o.
Oh, I can't see.
I can't see.
We're in a right-hand spin. Pull her out.
But I can't see.
That's it. Right forward. Left.
We're over our own lines, aren't we?
Yes, but the ground's just as hard here.
Look out. Here it comes.
Court, get me down.
Hello. Are you all right?
I'm fighting the wrong way.
Wait a minute. Look out for the petrol.
- Right.
- Right. Easy now, sir.
- Give me something, I can't see.
- Here you are.
Here's your scarf.
Well, we made it. We made it.
Mine is a farce.
They command themselves.
- Orders don't mean anything. It's a circus.
- Remember--
I remember giving orders.
Give me my tunic.
- Yes, sir.
- Those orders have been disobeyed.
With Infantry or other branch, an officer can keep discipline. What can I do?
All right, thank you.
They're laughing up their sleeves.
- Or dead.
- Yes, or dead.
No, they're not dead.
Courtney! Scott!
- All right, you can go.
- Thank you, sir.
Good morning, gentlemen.
- Good morning, Phipps.
- Good morning, Phipps.
What do you fellows imagine
I'm here for?
To watch you turn the army into a circus?
I've played fair, but this is organized warfare not your own private feud.
You went out against Von Richter outnumbered four to one.
You fools, when we need every man and every plane.
I'm not gonna stand for it any longer.
I've made out a report on the situation for headquarters.
- Fifty-ninth.
- There'll be a court-martial.
Somebody's going to get hurt.
Give it to me.
All right, stand at ease.
- Hello. Hello.
- Brand?
- This is Brand.
- Congratulations.
- What?
- Splendid job.
The drome was bombed?
What drome? Where?
We've learned your squadron ble w the air base off the map. Nice w ork.
- Here-- Wait. Excuse me.
- Splendid job of bombing the airdrome.
- Destroyed it?
- Yes, a perfect job.
- Really?
- Ble w the w hole place up.
Yes, sir. Yes, yes.
From here, yes they did.
- Did you send both flights?
- Only two of them.
- Only t w o ships? That's splendid.
- What?
General Barranger has ordered your immediate transfer to Wing. Are you there?
Excuse me, excuse me, sir.
Would you mind repeating that again, sir?
Has ordered your immediate transfer to Wing.
- Yes, sir.
- Appoint someone in your place.
With pleasure. Right away, sir.
We w ant more of this sort of thing.
We'll see that you are transferred to a more important position.
- Is that clear?
- Thank you, sir, thank you.
Come on, fellas, come into my parlor.
- Oh, get me another glass, will you, Phipps?
- Yes, sir.
- Here, you are, Phipps. Courtney. Scott.
- Thank you.
- Thanks.
- And myself.
And now I've got you, Courtney.
I've got you where I want you.
So far, the war has been a personal adventure for you.
Full of... and glory.
As an individual flier, you've been admirable.
And you've evaded responsibility with equally supreme skill.
Disobeyed orders, blamed me, accused me of putting kids into canvas coffins.
Well, listen to this, my lad.
Headquarters liked your raid this morning.
They liked it so well that they've appointed me up to Wing.
Excuse me, Phipps.
And before I go, I'm ordered to appoint someone in my place.
- Here at my place at this little desk.
- What do you mean?
I mean that that someone is going to be you.
See how you like it,
Mr. Squadron Commander Courtney.
Right.
- Goodbye, Phipps. I'll be writing to you.
- Goodbye, sir.
- Hello, 59th. Hold on.
- 59th?
- Hello. Yes?
- Hello, 59th. Hello.
Let me speak w ith the commanding officer.
It's for the commanding officer.
That's you, Captain Courtney.
- Hello?
- Speak louder.
- I can't hear you.
- Hello.
At da w n tomorro w,
put both flights into the air.
- What is it?
- That's his third bottle going in.
He won't listen to me.
- Let the infantry get demoralized.
- We can't.
No. I can't put planes over them, because
I haven't got anybody left to fly them.
- You have no man left to fly them?
- No. Replacements?
- Six of them, poor kids.
- Never mind that.
Von Richter's shot us out of the air.
He's killed all our best men.
- What do you expect us to do?
- Green kids can't stop him.
- They've had enough training.
- He'll shoot them down.
You have your orders.
No w see that you follo w them out.
Yes.
All right, it'll be done, but I tell you they haven't got a chance on earth.
Brass hats, sitting up there in easy chairs.
- Trying to make excuses--
- Third of the bottle down the hatch.
- You'll have geese on your desk--
- All right, what?
- I'm sorry.
- Wait a minute. I'm sorry, old chap.
Scott-o, that's bad, isn't it?
I'm as jumpy as the dickens.
Oh, I get like that too.
You know, I can't get used to being up there in front of that flight all alone.
- I miss you up there.
- Do you? I miss it too.
- This is a rotten job.
- Well, somebody's got to do it.
But why me?
I'm supposed to be a flier, I think.
None better, my boy.
I heard a good story from one of the mechanics just now.
- Two fishermen went out, three fisher--
- Not now, old chap. Do you mind?
I've been talking to headquarters.
We've got a rotten job ahead of us now.
Do you remember Brand used to call himself the executioner?
Poor Brand. He was nearly half-witty when he left this place.
Yes. I'm beginning to understand a lot about him.
He's probably in Paris with a bottle in one hand and a blond in the other--
Replacements.
More lambs for the slaughter.
Fix them up.
- Make them as comfortable as you can.
- I will.
Oh, they're really young this time.
How many hours have you actually had?
Hours? Nine to be precise.
That was at Hendon, of course.
I got my wings on a Longhorn.
Finished off in a good old Avro all the way out.
An FE for me, though, any day.
- Donnie.
- Scotty.
- Where did you come from?
- Oh, Hendon.
Gents, this is my brother, Captain Scott.
- I thought you were in school.
- Not much. I had to get in this.
I went through ground-school in precisely four weeks and two days.
- You did, huh?
- Yes.
- Well, aren't you glad to see me?
- Yes. Of course I am.
- This is my baby brother.
- How do you do, sir?
- How do you do, sergeant?
- Come on inside.
Attention.
I'm the skipper of A Flight.
Lieutenant Billings, sir, reporting from the pool for duty.
Stand at ease, gentlemen.
There's no formality here.
Billings.
- Will you take care of these officers for me?
- Yes, sir.
- You've got a bar in here and everything.
- I suppose you drink now, do you?
I did have a couple coming over on the boat. It made me sick.
- Good.
- I could try one with you.
No.
- Now, look here, Scotty.
- Or what?
Hold down on this baby stuff.
You're the big lad of the family...
...but I'm in this with you now, officer-and-gentlemen stuff.
- How many hours have you had?
- Nine.
Nine.
Oh, now, listen, Scotty. I went through combat maneuvers without a hitch.
You should have seen me.
I'm sure you did, Donnie. I'll show you your room. You can share mine with me.
That's great. By the way, isn't Court in command here?
- Yes.
- Well, can't we go and see him?
You'll see him soon enough. Come on.
Come on, old chap. Ready for orders?
Come on.
Attention.
Turn that thing off, will you, Aimes?
- Attention, men.
- Quiet, lads. Line up, please.
Orders for tomorrow morning.
Good evening, gentlemen.
There's no secrecy about these orders.
GHQ has discovered that Fritz is making a big push the day after tomorrow.
They've started minor advances already.
You're to patrol the Mantez Woods Sector.
That's opposite the German 6th army.
You'll fly four patrols a day...
...which means that every man will be in the air at dawn.
As usual, you've got the dirty work to do, low flying, machine gunning infantry...
...strafing supply trucks and any shock troops they try to bring up.
You're flying directly below Von Richter's patrols, so you better watch out.
- That's all.
- Court?
- Oh, may I say hello, sir?
- Donnie.
- Donnie Scott. Where did you spring from?
- Hendon.
Hendon?
You're...
- You're one of the replacements?
- Yes. I go up tomorrow, don't I?
Yes, you do.
Court, you're not sending him up on patrol tomorrow. You can't do that.
Every man goes up tomorrow, Scott-o.
If you think I'm taking him up, you're crazy.
- Oh, but, listen, Scotty, I'm an excellent--
- Oh, shut up.
He's not going up.
- Be ready at dawn tomorrow.
- Yes, sir.
Now, look here, Scotty--
You wait here.
And you're the one that gapped to Brand about sending green kids up to get killed.
Combat maneuvers. Ground-school.
He doesn't know.
What chance would he have up there?
He'll have as much chance as the others.
There can't be any exceptions.
Do you think I want to do this?
Those are the orders.
Oh, I know it's orders, Court.
Give me three days, two days.
Then I can get him up in the air...
...and teach him a few basic tricks.
At least he'll have a fighting chance.
He doesn't know anything.
Court, he can't even do a half-loop and roll out.
Do you hear that? He can't even roll out.
What good's he gonna be up there?
Do you think he's gonna bring down any Boche plane? No.
They'll slaughter him, Court.
Give me just a few days.
I said every man goes into the air at dawn.
- I'm sorry, Scott-o, but there it is.
- I won't take him up.
- Those are the orders.
- I don't care. I won't do it.
Those are the orders! Now, get out!
Get out.
Right.
- Headquarters.
- Hello, headquarters.
- Are you there?
- Yes.
This is 59th Squadron.
I want to talk to General Barranger.
- Is it urgent?
- Yes, it's very urgent.
Right.
- Hello, hello.
- Hello, yes? Yes, sir, Courtney.
I wouldn't have bothered, but we've got an impossible situation.
- Didn't your replacements reach you?
- The replacements? Yes, they arrived.
- They're kids.
- They've had training.
They'll be no earthly use against Von Richter.
They haven't even the first idea of combat tactics. Green kids.
- We sent the best men w e have.
- Yes, I know, sir.
- But this job's--
- It's the best w e can do.
- What do you expect us to do?
- Yes, sir.
- May I go on?
- Well?
If I could have a week with them, a few days to teach them some things.
Show them a few tricks so they'll be of use before they get killed--
Don't bother me again about this.
Do as you're told. Goodbye.
I know it's against the rules and regulations to burst into your sanctum sanctorum...
...but could I have just one word with you, please, Court?
Of course you could, Donnie.
- Good old Court.
- I'm glad you came. What is it?
Well, I wish Scott-o and you wouldn't scrap about me like this.
Honestly, I'm an excellent flier.
I've had combat maneuvers--
Combat maneuvers, have you?
Now, don't you laugh too.
Scotty lost his head completely.
- Oh, we all do here sometimes.
- Yes, of course.
Your nerves get jumpy.
A lot of fellas bunched together.
Scotty's responsible for the other fliers.
When he sees me fly, he won't worry then.
It's not just a question of flying. You see, you're gonna be up against veterans.
Fliers like Von Richter.
Are you trying to say that, that you think I won't get back tomorrow?
No, no. There's nothing so terribly difficult about combat flying...
...except remember that Scotty and those fellows have had experience.
They're old hands.
You can't afford to be too careless or overconfident at first.
It's rather like a game at school. You gotta be on your toes, watch everything.
Never forget anything you learn.
- You won't have any trouble.
- I'm glad to hear you say that.
It's true.
When you go out tomorrow, you stick close to Scotty.
Watch everything he does.
See the way he handles his ship.
- He is a fine flier, isn't he, Court?
- The best.
- Do you smoke?
- Yes, sir.
Oh, thanks, Court.
You know, I liked your comparison about this and a game at school.
Did you? That's just about what it is.
Great, big, noisy, rather stupid game that doesn't make any sense at all.
None of us know what it's all about or why.
Here we are, going at it hammer and tongs.
I bet you those fellows there feel exactly the same way about the enemy.
Possibly.
Then one day I suppose it'll all end as suddenly as it began. We'll go home...
...till some other bunch of criminal idiots sitting around a large table...
...shoves us into another war, then we'll go at it again.
Do you remember my father? He used to be a professor of biology at Queens.
He always used to say:
"Man is a savage animal who, periodically, to relieve his nervous tension...
...tries to destroy himself."
That's just about what it is, Donnie.
I see.
- Good night, Donnie.
- Good night, Court.
- Sleep tight.
- Thanks.
Oh, I--
I suppose it is just possible that one might not get back.
It has been known, hasn't it?
Well, in that case, I...
Would you mind if I left this with you?
What is it?
Oh, it's something I got on the crew last year.
It's silly, but, well, it's rather important to me.
Good night.
There's Mantez and the 6th German army.
- Right under Von Richter's patrol.
- Where's Von Richter?
Gentlemen, Major Courtney.
Good morning.
I wanted to wish you good luck.
Sorry I didn't have any chance to meet you last night.
- Best of luck. Same to you.
- Thank you.
- And you.
- Thank you, sir.
- Good luck.
- Thank you, sir.
- Is Captain Scott down yet?
- On his way, excuse me.
Gentlemen, these are your planes:
Mr. Moorehead, Number 6.
- Mr. Rutherford, Number 5.
- They're game lads, aren't they?
- Young England.
- Yes.
This is Number 3, Number 4 on the end.
Hello, Court.
- Good luck.
- Thanks.
Now, remember, stick close and I'll get you through.
Don't worry about me, Scott-o.
I'm fine, couldn't be better.
- Switch off.
- Switch off.
- Contact.
- Contact.
Switch off.
- Switch off.
- Contact.
Contact.
Donnie!
Donnie!
- Two planes back.
- I know.
- Who?
- Scott-o, Billings.
You got what you wanted.
He's gone, just as I knew he would.
I watched him burning.
You killed him.
I didn't kill him.
You sent him up, you dirty butcher.
All right, gentlemen.
What a rotten war.
Come on, Ronald, say good morning.
Say good morning.
There you are, sir. There you are.
Personality, that's what you said.
Personality.
- Hello, Brand.
- Hello, Phipps.
- You look like a new man.
- I never felt better in my life.
- Have you missed me?
- Well, yes, sir.
Hello, sergeant.
How are the chickens?
- Top old eggs, sir.
- How's Courtney?
- Oh, he's inside.
- Go on, driver. Hop on behind.
Hello, Brand.
Hello, Courtney. How are you?
- You're looking fine.
- I couldn't feel better.
- Same old place, eh?
- Same old place.
- Well, how are you, old boy?
- Wonderful.
What?
I was wondering if you could stop playing with that.
Oh, I'm sorry. Nerves, I know.
I say, Courtney, do you remember those Gyppie cork tips...
...that you used to scream about?
I found a tin of them in the mess.
- You mean you brought these along for me?
- Yeah.
Well, thanks very much.
- Have a drink or something.
- Oh, thanks.
- Glass behind you.
- One for you?
- Yes, thanks.
- Hey, where's Scotty?
I don't know.
How is he?
He's all right, I think.
Scotty and I haven't talked to each other for about two weeks.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Courtney, I hear headquarters have been giving you a rotten time lately.
The old man says you've been kicking up the very devil.
Is he? Well, you ought to know, you're up there.
Come on, Brand, come on. What is it?
Too important to telephone about.
- That's insane. You know that, don't you?
- Yes.
The enemy are making their biggest push the day after tomorrow.
They've concentrated the munitions at the Soulet railhead.
You destroy that railhead, you'll stop their drives.
But, Brand, you're crazy.
Soulet is 60 kilometers behind the enemy lines.
The German air force would be on our tails before we were halfway.
- The flight couldn't make it.
- One plane could.
- What do you mean, one plane?
- One plane. One man. At dusk.
It's up to one man to go alone...
...to take a chance at getting through before they can stop him.
Do you think I could ask a man to do that?
He'd be dead before he started.
What can you do? You can't refuse.
No. I'll go myself.
I'm afraid you can't do that.
I know exactly how you feel.
I had it myself for months.
Here at this desk, chained to it.
You'll have to ask for a volunteer.
The instructions are all here.
All right.
Attention, gentlemen.
Stay where you are, gentlemen.
I have a job for you.
This just came in from Wing, gentlemen:
"Enemy in the 22nd and 23rd sectors plan major offensive...
...on the entire front
19th instant at ack-emma.
Munitions for the advance concentrated in a dump at railhead at Soulet."
Our squadron's ordered to destroy it.
Soulet's 60 kilometers behind the German lines.
There's no chance for a flight to get through.
But one man, flying low, hedgehopping, might possibly succeed.
- Chances are 10-to-1 he won't come back.
- I'll go.
- I'd like a volunteer.
- I spoke first. Do I get that job?
Is it mine?
Right.
Here are your instructions.
You leave at dusk.
You've got about two hours.
Right.
Tell Sergeant Watkins to get my plane ready.
- Get that out by the first post, Kirby.
- Yes, sir.
Here's this razor you like so much.
You take that.
- For me, sir?
- For you, sir.
I couldn't, sir. You'll be wanting it when you come back from the flight.
Tomorrow morning, you'll be yelling,
"Kirby!
How'd you think I can shave without me razor?"
No, Kirby. From now on,
I'm going to grow a long beard.
Take this.
Make you smell like a geranium.
Very good, sir, if you insist.
Shirts, socks.
Here, take the whole lot, Kirby.
- Come in.
- Oh, don't say that, sir.
I've been going over this and I've found a route that'll give you a better chance.
Don't bother.
I don't want to hear anything from you.
I'm in command here and you'll listen to what I have to say.
I want that plane back, you understand?
We need them all.
- I want you back.
- Back.
Yes, back.
- Bring some chairs, Kirby.
- Yes, sir.
Thank you. All right, that's all.
I've been in touch with Intelligence and they've given me some--
- No, thank you.
- No?
They've given me some rather interesting information about this section here.
It seems that for a quarter of a mile, there's hardly anti-aircraft.
That'd be a very good place to cross.
Go north then fly low into the entrance of the Luonne Valley.
Fly low--
Thanks.
I say you fly low into the entrance of Luonne Valley.
As you know, there's no activity there, either.
The hills will hide you until you're through it.
And then you go north.
Hit the railway here.
Then east following the tracks right into Soulet.
Around here, all the big ammunition dumps. They're all grouped together.
A hit anywhere in that vicinity will set the whole thing off.
The enemy high patrol gets back at dusk...
...so you'll have to fly low to avoid them.
Your only chance is to get there before they spot you.
That's amazing.
From that point on, the place is alive with archies.
They'll phone ahead and you'll probably run into some barrages...
...but you'll just have to keep on going...
...and that's all.
Yes, that is undoubtedly all.
- I've a suggestion to make.
- What's that?
You've got an hour and a half.
Why don't you lie down and have a sleep.
It'll do you good, freshen you up.
Get on your toes.
No, I couldn't sleep.
No? Well, how about one for the road?
No, I had two already.
This stuff works too quickly on me.
- Oh, come on. One more won't hurt you.
- No, thank-- Well...
To the job.
I'll drink to that.
- To the job.
- Right.
- You're a funny bird.
- Really?
I found myself very amusing lately.
You know, I've never seen one of those big munition dumps hit the ceiling.
When it does, you'll probably hear it back here. If you do, you can think of me.
Right. I'll think.
Court?
It's all the war, isn't it?
Donnie going and the old brass hats.
- A Flight, B Flight.
- Orders.
Drinks, friends.
I shouldn't go up there bad friends with anybody, should I?
Be a good idea if you didn't.
What I mean is especially with you.
It has been a long time, hasn't it?
London, home, and all that.
- We've had some fun, though, haven't we?
- Yes. Pretty good times.
I've missed you, especially when I'd had a few beakers.
Nobody to take care of the corpse.
Good old Scotty blotto again, you know.
- You never did now when to stop anyway.
- Oh, it's no fun if you stop.
Cheers.
You ever forget that awful night at Carsnips when I fell over with my head in the soup...
...and you weren't there to pick me out?
You should've seen her when the soup arrived in her lap.
Oh, she never had a lap. Ever see anything quite so straight sitting down?
- No. A lamp post.
- Optical Illusion.
There go me beads.
Oh, well, it's fun looking back, isn't it?
You're an awful old fool, you know?
How about that 40 winks?
- Little froufrou. She hasn't altered much.
- No. Still the same.
I shall now wake up with a nice, fresh smile for Fritzie.
Good morning, Fritzie.
Here is your morning cup of tea:
And your morning bun:
- Court, I shouldn't be doing this.
- Oh, lie down. You've got lots of time.
- Well, you get me up. I rely on you.
- Leave it to me.
- The C.O. coming to see him off.
- Gun's are all right.
They'd better be. The rest of the plane too. She's going on a real trip this time.
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening, sergeant.
- Check the guns?
- Yes. They're all checked, sir.
- You're not flying, sir.
- Yes, I am, sergeant.
- Good luck, sir.
- Thanks, sergeant.
As a matter of fact, thanks for everything.
Give my love to the bees and the chickens.
- Switch off.
- Switch off.
- Contact.
- Contact.
- Have you got that?
- Yes. Replacements tonight.
A Flight at dawn.
B Flight accompany bombers.
- You got that, Phipps?
- Yes, sir.
And another thing...
...keep in touch with the observation posts at Mainz for news of Courtney.
- I think we--
- You think? Well, don't think!
Tell them to keep their eyes open.
I think he's coming back.
- Just a little bit, sir--
- No, no.
I think you take a little, sir.
We've got a petrol trench down the side of the field.
When we hear his motor, we'll light it, of course.
Yes? Any news.
- Here's good ne w s for you.
- Good news?
You have received special mention for your part in stopping the enemy advance.
What?
The 59th has received special mention...
...for their work in stopping the enemy advance.
Why wasn't it me up there, Phipps?
I'm the one to be up there.
If only I'd known he was--
He may come back.
Here he is!
Enemy plane!
It's his helmet and goggles.
It means a very gallant gentlemen died this afternoon.
And for what?
What we have all these deaths accomplished?
So many fine chaps who have died in this war...
...and are going to die in the future wars.
That's all, gentlemen.
Goodbye, Court.
Come along, sir.
Fall in, gentlemen.
Come along, lads. Line up, please.
Attention.
Orders for tomorrow morning.
Come along.
The 59th has received special mention...
...for its part in checking the enemy advance.
I know that--
Pardon me, gentlemen.
Commanding officer's inside, sir.
Will you follow me, please?
Wait here, please, gentlemen.
- Replacements, sir.
- Bring them in, Sergeant Watkins.
This way, please, gentlemen.
Lieutenant Carter, reporting from the pool for duty, sir.
Very good, lads. Fall in.
Attention, commanding officer.
Stand easy.
Gentlemen, you will be glad to know...
...that the 59th Squadron has just received special mention...
...for its part in checking the enemy advance.
Orders for tomorrow:
A Flight, ready to take off at dawn.
Patrol Marne Sector, 3500 meters.
B Flight, accompany bombers.
Mantez Wood Sector, 4000 meters.
You understand, gentlemen, that this sector is a particularly dangerous one.
You new men, watch your flight leaders.
Act instantly on their signals.
That will be your only chance of coming through.
That's all.
Get ready!
Grenadiers in front!
Gilbert, you got my home address?
This is for France, my friends.
Make it good.
We have to take that village back.
It's ours!
Everyone ready?
- After you, Lieutenant.
- Why? Are you afraid?
Me? I'll be the first in line.
Morache is getting cold feet.
Oh, no, he'll go, even if it's tougher than court-martialing them.
First group, advance!
Forward!
Forward, men!
Hello?
We can't hear anything.
The village will be tough to capture.
It's swarming with machine guns.
They're a good regiment.
They'll get through.
Get down!
Keep close to the walls!
They've broken through the first line.
They're continuing to advance.
Good work! You're brave men!
My thanks, boys.
Let's break through their third line!
Third Squadron, on my command!
The captain's dead!
Come on, boys!
Dear God!
IT WENT ON FOR TEN DAYS
TEN DAYS
TEN DAYS
- Where's Sulphart?
- Don't worry. He took cover.
- He may be wounded.
- Doesn't he wish!
Let's use him as a parapet.
Yeah, better than nothing until our turn comes.
Sulphart, you out there?
When they sight this ridge, we're done for!
Here come the Krauts!
Aim lower!
Ground level!
It's starting again!
- You hit?
- No.
Poor guy's dead.
He asked me to write to his mother.
Just a little further and their post is ours!
Keep advancing?
He's lost his mind!
Forward!
Wait a second.
Good God, it really is a cemetery!
We've gotta get organized.
They'll counterattack for sure.
No noise.
They're right on the other side.
Don't worry.
We're not about to start singing.
Killed defending a cemetery... that's too much.
They'll bury us alive to save time.
This is just the right length.
Good news, Gilbert?
"... I danced so much that I broke a heel..."
Sure.
What are you singing?
The mass for the dead.
Bouffioux, anything left in your flask?
Afraid to show your face, tub of lard!
Not a drop to drink all day.
I'll die!
Gilbert will buy us buckets of wine on leave.
We'll dunk our heads in like horses at the trough.
Look.
My tongue's dry as plaster.
If the corporal would just do his job!
I'm gonna tell him.
Give me your flasks.
Hurry up.
Listen, Bréval.
No one has water.
You've got to send someone to the well.
- Whose turn is it?
- Not mine!
I just came in from grenade duty.
- So you won't go?
- When it's my turn, I will.
Very well. I'll go myself.
Hey, Bréval's hit!
- Bréval's dead!
- Where?
- By the well.
- Dear God! Trying to get water?
- I'm going.
- You crazy? You'll get killed too!
- Where's Bréval?
- By the well.
Come on.
It's not all bad.
Now they have to evacuate you.
No, it's all over.
I'm not crying for myself but for my little girl.
Don't talk.
It'll wear you out.
It doesn't matter now.
Gilbert... swear you'll do something for me.
Go see my wife and tell her what she did was wrong.
It hurt me real bad.
What's going on?
She has to know.
Tell her
I cursed her name before I died, that I spit in her face... her and that other guy.
I'm asking you, in God's name!
Make sure everyone knows she was living it up while I was dying at the front!
The bitch!
No, don't.
For my little girl's sake, don't do it.
Tell my wife she has to behave herself now.
That this was my dying request.
And tell her... that I forgive her.
They're attacking!
Help!
They're slaughtering us!
Oh, yes, you'll get your cross
It might be bronze
It might be wood
But you'll get your cross
If not the Croix de guerre then a wooden cross
Ain't you got any happier songs?
Shut up! 
I wrote that for the guys to sing on leave.
- Who wants brandy?
- Shove your brandy!
If not the Croix de guerre then a wooden cross
You weren't so cocky last night in the cemetery.
I was sure we'd all die.
Was it tough, boys?
This is all that's left of the company.
That wasn't a battle... it was a massacre.
I disagree.
- What?
- I'd call it a victory.
He's flipped his lid.
I mean it.
I consider it a victory because I made it out alive.
I gave orders to assemble!
- Morache!
- He's worse than the plague!
- No sign of him last night.
- Berthier did all the work.
Sergeants, hurry and line up your men.
We're parading in the village.
The general's waiting.
What?
A parade?
They've gotta be kidding!
- We're dead as it is.
- It's to see who's not dead yet.
Well, I'm not going.
Lieutenant, they can't make us parade in this condition.
Yes, the general wants to see us.
Reinforcements have arrived.
We have to show them we're not little girls.
We're barely hanging on.
Come now, just a bit more.
You can rest later.
Get those packs on!
This is too much.
They'll squeeze every last drop out of us.
Line up in the road in rows of four!
Fix bayonets!
Right shoulder arms!
Get in step! March!
Attention!
Present arms!
Present arms!
We're the ones who saved the town!
We saved the town!
Will lots of guys go on leave today?
Maybe ten percent.
Colon went to ask.
Ten percent? You're kidding.
We'll never get out of here.
- Shame on you!
- Wait till you've suffered like us!
You can argue later!
Third Section, First Squadron!
Present!
Here's some guys back from leave.
Hey, Lemoine, what did you bring us to drink?
- The 25 days flew by!
- Bet you had time to hoe your beets!
Bet you'd like a sip of this Calvados from back home!
Don't get mad, hayseed.
Here's my corkscrew.
Pop that cork!
- What's new at home?
- They're holding up.
The war could last seven years and the theaters would still be full!
And when's the war gonna end?
No one cares about the war anymore but old biddies with sons at the front.
Sulphart!
Gilbert, old buddy!
I saw your parents!
I'll tell you all about it!
They were so nice!
I saw them last Sunday.
They asked me to stay for lunch.
What a feast!
And the wine!
I told them all about our life in the trenches, the rain, the mud,
and how rotten Morache is.
I told them about the last attack and the town we captured.
They don't know much about the war.
They were very interested, but they just don't understand.
They wouldn't believe that you could have lice.
Listen, Gilbert, that little maid of yours...
She's awful nice.
I tried to get a date, but nothing doing.
Next time. I'm going on leave tonight. 
I'll talk to her.
It's your turn?
Lucky devil!
But what about us?
We're stuck here!
Look at this.
A steady stream of wounded since this morning.
Seems things aren't going well.
You men going on leave, let's go!
I'm coming!
Where are my sacks?
I got back just in time to say good-bye.
Good-bye, my friend.
Hear that attack?
Time to clear out!
Looks like reinforcements.
They're welcoming us back.
Hurry it up, boys!
- Corporals!
- Present, sir.
Assemble your men in the square in 30 minutes.
- What about us?
- Who?
- We're going on leave.
- All leaves are canceled.
Keep to the right!
Keep to the right!
And the party goes on.
Slow down up front.
- We can't keep up.
- Tough!
Quiet!
Quiet! Pass it down.
They coming to relieve us?
Are the Krauts far?
Don't know anymore. 
It's been four days of attack and counterattack.
Water!
- Who's that?
- One of ours.
Two men got killed already trying to bring him in.
If you can do anything...
This place is sturdy!
Let 'em fire all they want!
Sturdy or not, they're really shelling.
Is someone still up there?
A reduced guard.
That's not enough.
Send someone up.
Bouffioux, your turn.
Me? I can hardly see.
I can't be a lookout.
Enough.
You can snivel about it later.
I told you I can't see a thing!
I'll find you some glasses.
Get ready.
- Corporal!
- He said to get ready.
This is too much!
I can't even see!
Your whining makes me sick.
I'll take your place.
Lemoine!
Don't worry, pal.
My time's not up yet.
Well, it didn't miss by much.
Fat bastard.
We're safe here, with 12 feet of earth above us.
But we have to go outside tomorrow.
Are we really attacking at dawn?
Seems that way.
Lemoine!
Well?
Another lookout.
I guess it's my turn.
Water!
I'm with the Seventh Regiment.
Don't leave me out here, boys.
I have a mother.
I have a mother.
I have a mother.
Don't leave me out here.
Where's the captain?
Very well.
We're all staying here.
Too bad.
No hiding in the craters!
We have to break through now!
I'm hit!
I'm wounded, boys.
Get to first aid, quick!
Another one!
Forward!
- We have to cut off two fingers.
- Go ahead. I'm no pianist.
I hope Gilbert makes it back.
That hurts.
Oh, the pain.
- Medic!
- Get down!
Hey, buddy!
Over here! I'm hit!
God, I swear I won't move... but just make it stop hurting.
When it gets dark, the medics will come.
I got to stay conscious until then.
I got to wait for nightfall.
They won't see me on the ground like this.
They'll leave me to die.
I don't want...
It hurts!
The pain!
Help!
Get me out of here!
Hurry up, boys!
Come on, boys!
It's so dark!
Hey, medics!
No, I won't!
I can't fall asleep.
I can't.
Returning from Montmartre
From Montmartre to Paris
I saw a plum tree

As long as it lasts

Driver.
- Driver, stop!
- What type is in there?
Why do you want to stop?
The man up there. He is bleeding to death.
We can't stop. Not here.
The brakes won't hold.
Orderly, Orderly! and just as guilty as a soldier would be.....
...who deserted his post under fire.
Now in making an example of you, I....
I beg your pardon sir. I have some wounded outside. I am looking for the...
Oh yes, yes, yes. You want the
Italian unit. We are the English unit you see.
- Yes number 207.
- They're in the other wing. Moved in today.
Yes out that way, straight ahead.
Thank-you Major.
What's the girl's friend been doing?
Typical male conceit.
I think they're going to send her back home.
It's a dirty shame.
She'll be disgraced.
- It's the regulations.
- At least to have a baby here???
If they send her back now, all her friends will know.
She's only herself to blame.
This is war, Fergie. And she loved him.
Shh, here they come.
Well, is it necessary for us all to be here at one time? Get back to your post.
You'll be packed and ready to leave within the hour.
Molly.
Can I help pack.
I guess so....if you want to.
Why of course I want to.
- Good girls.
- I beg your pardon?
I say, she's the only human being in the whole lot of us.
I'm sorry Miss Barkley appears to sympathize with one....
....that has disgraced the uniform we all wear.
- Baby!
- Rinaldi!
- Federico!
Get away. You're filthy.
You Anglo-Saxons. You're not to clean yourself.
Did you bring me some good kisses, baby? Did you have trouble finding us?
No.
How do you feel? Is there going to be an offensive?
Were you under fire? Madonna, but
I worried about you!
Yes, I can see how much you've been worrying.
I had 7 operations today baby and one of them was beautiful.
I took the heart out.
It lay in my hand, and beat like this.
You should have seen it. It was lovely.
Soon Rinaldi will be the best surgeon in all the court.
Then in all the army..... and some day, in all of Italy.
- Why not in all the world?
- Why not?
You will like it here baby.
What sort of a town is this?
Any girls?
Many beautiful English nurses.
No, I mean girls.
Girls to, the house's full of them.
Another villa Rosa?
Some of them have never been to the front before. perhaps... but the nurses are much nicer
The most beautiful is Miss Barkley
I am in love with her.
Does she know it?
Not yet.
Have you any money?
- Yes.
- Lend me 50 lire.
What for?
I want to make on Miss Barkley the impression of a man of sufficient wealth.
- All right.
- Thank-you.
You are my great and good friend and financial protector.
And you're an ass.
Now we will eat and drink and I will take you to meet Miss Barkley.
But, you must make for me a good impression upon her.
- Now listen......
- But you must.
And you can have a nurse too.
There is another one named Miss
Ferguson. She is also very, very nice.
- No.
- No?
First we will eat and drink and then we'll go and see the girls who have never been to the front before, yes?
Yes.
You know what an American is? yes
What is it?
She doesn't know.
Well I'm an American.
Then what are you doing here?
Drinking, mostly.
He likes the uniform.
He's wrong.
I like them languages.
Then what were you doing in Italy?
Studying.
Studying what?
Architecture.
You know what that is?
Yes.
What?
You see, she doesn't know.
Neither do I.
Oh, you've had too much wine.
It's filthy wine....it takes the enamel off your teeth and leaves it on the roof of your mouth.
- Where was I?
- Architecture.
Oh yes. Look.....
.....I'll explain.
This my dear, is called an arch....
The arch my dear, is perhaps the oldest of architecturial devices.
Arch. Architecture.
The very word will tell you how inextricably the two are one.
In a word my dear.....
Architecture.....
...is the most ancient of the arts.
You'd better put your shoe on, you'll get cold feet.
If you please, I'd like to go now.
The air raid seems to be over.
Catherine.
Catherine.
- Catherine.
- Here I am Fergie. I'm coming.
Oh, I was so worried.
Did you think I'd been blown away?
I didn't know what to think. Nobody saw where you went.
Who's that man.
Oh, I don't know.
Some lunatic.
Come on.
What if we take the mountains to the north. Behind them are more mountains.... and behind those more yet. And we take them all only if the Austrians stop fighting.
One side of course will stop.
- It will go on forever.
- Like him.
No, no, no. It is not true.
But you don't want us to attack?
If we must have war, I suppose we have to attack.
But, so many die that way.
But what is death to a Christian.
Don't encourage him Fergie.
Frederico.
- You are back safe.
- Hello Father.
- I am so glad.
- He prays and prays for you Frederico.
Every time you go out the door, he does the same.
Oh, I pray for you all.
You are late baby. How is it up there? Quiet?
You nearly missed the party.
But it is very dull.
But Miss Barkley is her and her friend Miss Ferguson.
The one you will like. Come.
Miss Barkley, permit me to present to you...
... my friend and war brother Lt. Henry.
He has just returned back from the front.
How do you do?
How do you do?
And this is Miss Ferguson.
-How do you do?
- How do you do?
Now he begins again, that fellow.
Quick let us go into the garden.
Now, you stay here.
I will find something for us to drink.
Asti? Grappa? Vermouth?
- Which do you like?
- All of them.
Then you shall have them.
-Nice out here.
- Isn't it?
We seem fated to bump into each other in the dark.
I'm sorry about that. I mistook you for someone else.
So I gathered.
- I had been drinking.
- I gathered that too.
- Mad?
- No.
- You're an American, aren't you?
- Yes.
Then what are you doing in the
Italian army?
It's not really the army, it's only the ambulance.
It's very odd. Why did you do it?
I don't know. Why did you?
Oh, I joined up in England.
The fact is the boy I was engaged to had gone across.
- Where is Miss Ferguson.
- Why don't you go and see?
Yes, do bring her out Captain
Rinaldi.
Have some?
Thanks.
He's sore.
What for?
Because I'm here with you.
Women prefer him as a rule.
Shall we take a walk?
Yes, let's.
- Where is he now?
- Who?
The boy you were engaged to.
He's dead.
He was killed in Assam.
Were you engaged long?
Eight years. We grew up together.
Why didn't you marry?
I didn't know what the war was like then
If I had to do over again, I'd marry him.
When I joined up, I had this silly idea that he may......
.....come to the hospital where I was.
With a saber cut I suppose and a bandage around his head.
Shot through the shoulder.
Something picturesque.
This is a picturesque front. Not
France.
He didn't have a saber cut.
They blew him to bits.
What are you thinking about now?
About whiskey.
What about whiskey?
About how nice it is.
You're nice too.
No.
- Why not?
- No don't.
- Yes.
- No please!
I'm sorry. Did I hurt you?
It's all right.
I'm dreadly sorry. Really.
I just couldn't bear...
...the nurses' evening-off aspect of it.
It's quite all right. I don't mind at all.
Poor man.
You see......I've been leading a funny sort of life.
Besides, you're so very beautiful.
You don't have to talk a lot of nonsense, I said I'm sorry.
We could get along.
Couldn't we?
You're sweet.
- No I'm not.
- Yes, you're a dear.
I'd be very glad to have you kiss me now, if you don't mind.
Your are looking for someone?
Have you seen Miss Barkley?
Miss Barkley?
Didn't she go out there with you?
With me?
No.
But just a little while ago?
I thought I saw her go out to the garden gate with the lieutenant Henry.
She went out with an officer?
Alone?
Well, perhaps I was mistaken, you know it is quite dark out there.
Oh she wouldn't do that.
No. No I am sure I was mistaken.
Where is she then?
You're a real girl.
I'm a crazy girl.
What? with bad ??? ideals??
It's nice and enough.
It's nice. I suppose that has to be enough for people who live as we live.
Back home I'd have courted you and send you flowers.
Out here you crowd it all into one hour.
Not the way it's got to be, out here. look, tomorrow morning I have to go to the front again. if a shell got me and you never saw me again then we'd both be sorry that we've been so formal waiting besides, what's this so fine, putting it off dragging it out? hearing the auditions ??? tonight
- you're so.... tomorrow
- no no wait, no please...
Catherine
Catherine thank you for the lovely concert
I hope you are not worried about Miss Barkley?
It's not like her to disappear this way.
Perhaps if she felt ill and went home alone. perhaps good night why didn't you tell me? it doesn't matter. if it had to happen,
I'd rather it were like this. a new church out??? and those stars why not? why not? there's a war on. and tonight who cares, and tomorrow who knows. what did you say your name was? stop it if you know how I was back home, you'd feel very sorry. please, stop it we blame everything on the war, but that's rot it's something in ourselves the lady sat in the public square and mourned her lost innocence don't be sorry
I'm not
I love you oh darling
Did you have a nice time baby?
You made progress with her, eh?
We're friends.
If that's what you mean?
I mean...was she nice to you, practically speaking?
Shut up!
I am a man of extreme delicacy, but was she.....
Rinaldi! Will you please shut up.
If you want to be a friend of mine, shut up.
I am your best friend and your war brother.
Then shut up.
Miss Barkley prefers you to me.
That is very clear.
But Miss Ferguson is very nice too.
Do you like her?
No!
That you of all people... you're all geese, that's what you are silly geese. stop this bunk??? about woman's part in the war we must bring solace to the men who fight sacrifice ourselves, give ourselves if you'd known him for a long time, had been in love with him but you only met him tonight
How long must you know a man before you can love him?
Are you pretending to be in love with that man?
I think I am.
I must be. it couldn't have happened. you're just another humped up steam??? one in a hundred you'll probably never see him again. he said if he'd met me back home he'd have courted me send me flowers but now
I suppose I won't ever see him again
Howdy. Good luck.
- Turn back.
- Back?
Yes, back!
- I want to see Miss Barkley.
- She's on duty.
Wait, don't go in there.
Why we come back here for?
Lt. knows what he's doing. Please.
- What's wrong?
- Aren't we going to get started here?
We have plenty of time.
I thought you started. What are you doing here?
We come back Senor Capitano.
The Lt. forgot something.
Hi....you're all right aren't you?
Yes, I'm all right.
I came to..
I thought.....
...you see.
I'm going to be away for a while..
...and I didn't want you to think that
I'd just gone away.
No, I...
What I mean is.....
....I'd hate to have you feel that... it wasn't important to me..
..about us.
I don't exactly know how to say it.
You said it very nicely dear, thank-you.
No, no I didn't.
- You mustn't feel.
- Will you be gone long?
No.
Only a few days. There's going to be a show up above Plava.
A show? You'll be careful won't you?
I won't get hit.
Hold this.
Here....
It's a St. Anthony.
They said St. Anthony is very useful to guard you from harm.
I'll take good care of him.
But I wish I could kiss you.
He is my friend and a good soldier
I would hate to see him lose his head over a woman.
Aren't you exaggerating a bit.
I think not.
Couldn't we send her back to the base, Major?
Oh, if you could send her away it would simplify everything
Could perhaps send her to Milan.
Excellent my dear Major.
Magnificent. No wonder the
English are first in diplomacy.
What did you say her name was?
We won't get anything else to eat, once the attacks start.
This is all they given me.
Starting to eat the rations?
No, we'll all eat together. Come on and sit down.
Thank-you.
Here, you cut this.
Here, take some cheese.
Wash it down with wine.
Who caused the attack?
Bersaglieri.
If nobody would attack, the war would be over.
- No, 305...
- It sounded like a Skoda to me.
- Skoda, that's what I say.
Lt.! Are you hurt?
My leg.
Both of my legs.
Lacerations of the scalp and possible fracture of the skull.
Multiply superficial wounds of the left and right thigh
......left and right knee and right foot..... profound wounds of right knee and foot in current line of duty. Next patient please.
Lift him up on the table. Carefully.
How do you feel, baby?
Rinaldi. What are you doing here?
Boneldo telephoned me.
The Major gave me permission to come.
No one shall hurt you baby. I won't let them.
No butcher is going to touch my war brother.
Only Rinaldi can take you and never hurt you.
You must forgive baby, for talking so much...
...but I am, I am very moved to see you bodily wounded.
I will see that you are decorated for bravery.
Perhaps we can you you the medallio d'argento, but surely the bronze one. Did you carry somebody on your back?
I didn't carry anybody. I couldn't move.
Surely there was something very heroic in what you did.
I was blown up eating cheese.
Don't worry baby. I will fix you so that you are as good as new.
You will see, everyday, I learn to do things smoother, quicker.
Soon, very soon, you will be walking again.
I brought a present for you.
You will find it under your blanket, next to your heart.
It is a bottle of brandy baby. Very good brandy.
The infantry captured it from the
Austrians on San Gabrielle.
I have another surprise for you.
Take a deep breath.
Where do you think you will go from here?
To the Italian hospital where they have the male nurses with the beards?
No!
I will arrange everything with my friend, the British Major.
You will go to Milan. To the beautiful Miss Barkley.
That makes you happy?
Poor Rinaldi. So alone with the war...
No one to make fun of. No one to lend him money.
While you are in Milan with the beautiful Miss Barkley.
Making love in Milan to the chaste
Miss Barkley.
Look out for the step.
Why do you stop?
I am superintendent. May I have your medical papers please.
They're in my coat. In the buttoned-down pocket.
Take him up those stairs, down the corridor.
His room is the one at the end.
You show him Julio.
Who are you?
I am the porter, Lt. Come follow me.
Now Lt., we must lift you up on the bed.
- All right. But keep my legs straight.
- Yes, yes Lt.
Can I get you anything?
- Get me some brandy.
- It is not allowed.
Wasn't I wounded, fighting for the glory of Italy?
- You'll find some money in my pocket.
- As you wish.
- So it's you!
- Ferguson.
- Is Catherine here?
- As if you didn't know.
I believe that's why you got wounded.
- Where is she?
-You ought to be still.
Here's your chart. I must take your temperature.
Does she know I'm here?
Under the arm please.
- Hello darling.
- Catherine.
You're lovely.
- Are you badly hurt?
- You're lovely.
- Oh my poor darling. It's your leg isn't it?
- You're the loveliest thing I ever saw.
I have to go now darling, I can't stay.
- Will you come back?
- Later, but we have to be awfully careful.
- You've got to come back.
- I will, when I can.
- Tonight?
- I'll try?
Somebody's coming.
Tonight.
I'll take that thermometer now.
Good gracious.
Fetch the doctor.
It's a miracle you're not delirious with such a fever.
- I haven't got any fever.
- Stay quiet.
It's not what you think.
I've brought you a few little things.
And this is mosquito netting and this is a bottle of vermouth.
You like vermouth?
- And these are English papers.
- Thank you for that.
It was very good of you to come.
I mustn't stay long. They warned me not to tire you.
You seem very tired yourself.
I am tired. I have no right to be.
You have the war disgusted.
No, I hate the war.
- I don't enjoy it.
- But you do not mind it.
You do not see it. Oh, you must forgive me. I know that you are wounded.
That was an accident.
Still even wounded, you do not see it.
I can tell. I do not see it myself, but
I feel it a little.
Come in Cath.
Don't go yet Father. It's still early.
Are you sure. With the operation in the morning, he should rest.
He's strong.
He has a lovely temperature. It is always normal.
I'm very proud of his temperature.
Maybe all of our children will have fine temperatures too.
Our children will probably have beastly temperatures.
Don't mind us Father. We're in love.
I know....
I can see it in your faces.
You approve, don't you, Father?
You spoke of children.
This too is the war. Without the war, you would have married in Gods grace.
Is it not so?
And you?
I hadn't thought about it like that.
But... yes, I suppose so.
Father, are you...
Is that the marriage service?
Don't you realize father that army regulations prevent us from marrying? it's in Katano??
Poor chap.
It's such a crazy marriage.
At least I'm in white.
No orange blossoms.
I can smell them.
No organ music.
I can hear it plainly.
It was a foolish notion perhaps.
I have not the right to say you are married.
Yet it has made me happy to do this.
For now, from my heart, can I say I bless you in His name.
Thank-you Father.
Good-bye and be happy, both of you.
Thank-you Father.
- Give my regards to the mess.
- I will.
And get well soon. I will come again the next time I am in Milan.
- Good-bye my dear.
- Good-bye.
Is Miss Barkley here? no.
Shut the door.
- But dear!
- please darling we mustn't do it. your operation's in the morning. it's our wedding night. oh darling you'll have to take your oil. castor oil? no! you'll take it from me
I'll take anything from you if you stay oh darling darling
I want what you want. there isn't any me any more, just what you want you're sweet when I think about the way... such a lovely way feel all we feel... no woman in my heart beat..
I'm mad about you...
That's the opera I made my debut in at La Scala.
They threw benches at him.
-That's a lie.
- Yes, they did. I threw six benches myself.
That's not funny.
Oh now he is offended.
He'll get over it. That's his sore spot. We always tease him.
- You don't care whom you hurt.
- Now don't you get mad too.
Catherine and I were thinking of asking you to our wedding.
Weren't we Catherine?
- You'll never get married.
- We will!
No you won't.
You'll fight before you marry.
- Oh, we never fight.
- You've time yet.
We won't fight ever.
You'll die then.
Fight or die. That's what people do.
- They don't marry.
- Fergie...
I'm not crying.
Maybe you'll be all right, you two.
Watch out you don't get her into trouble.
I won't get her into trouble.
We've had enough.
They'll kill you.
Why, Fergie.....
What is the matter with her?
She doesn't like me, that's all.
Oh no. She just likes me more.
Are you on night duty tonight?
Yes, but you won't care.
You'll go right off to sleep.
You wait and see......
Darling.....how many other girls have you ever loved?
None.
How many, really?
None.
How many have you... how do you say it?
... loved?
- None.
- you're lying to me.
Of course. that's right, just keep on lying, that's what I want you to do.
Were they pretty?
I've never been with anyone.
That's right darling.
What were they like?
I don't know anything about it.
You're just mine. That's true.
You've never belonged to anyone else.
I don't care if you have though. I'm not afraid of them.
Only don't tell me about them.
You never told them you loved them did you?
- No.
- I knew you wouldn't.
-Oh darling, I do love you.
- Then, kiss me.
- Right here on the street?
- Yes.
I'll go in first.
What is this? If I may ask.
What was in it.
That's Kümmel. That's the best kind. It comes in those bear shaped bottles from Russia.
And these.
That's brandy, wine and whiskey.
And I have been pitying you for being wounded.
Pity is something that is wasted on you.
Thank you.
If you're so anxious not to go back to the front......
.....I should think you'd try something more intelligent.
Not self-inflicted alcoholism.
- What?
- I said alcoholism.
And I also say, that I'll see you convalescent leave is canceled.
You'll go back to the front tomorrow night.
Have I time for a drink before the train leaves?
- For the front?
- Yes.
In about 20 minutes senor
Capitano. it's a fine room, a lovely room it's alright the red plush is just the thing. those mirrors are very attractive too people who go in for vice seem to have very good taste about it you're a grand girl oh darling
I wish you could do something really simple everything we do seems so innocent and right.
You're a fine simple girl.
I am a simple girl. Nobody but you ever realized it.
At first, I thought you were a crazy girl.
I was a little crazy at first.
Is that your train?
Maybe.....
It makes a return. But it stays in the station here until it is time to leave.
There's really lots of time.
But at my back, I always hear, time's wicked chariot hurrying near"....
I know that poem. It's by Marlowe. only it's about a girl who wouldn't live with a man.
Listen.
It's only the rain.
I hate the rain.
I like it.
I'm afraid of the rain.
Afraid, why?
I.....
Oh, perhaps it's silly.
What? Tell me.
- No. Don't make me.
- Tell me.
All right.,
I'm afraid of the rain, because sometimes I see me dead in it.
No!
And sometimes I see you dead in it.
-Well that's more likely.
-Oh no darling, don't say that.
That is your train.
"Time's winged chariot".
I'll come with you.
No, please, I don't want you. Not at the station.
All right darling.
How often will you write?
As often as I can. Do they read your letters?
They can't read English enough to hurt anything.
Well I'll make them very confusing.
But not too confusing.
Oh, I should have got you a going- away gift.
A whistle to make you feel better in the dark.
Or a sword. I'm sure we could get a used sword very cheap.
Swords aren't very useful at the front.
Oh I see, they get in the way of your legs when you are running.
They might be useful at mess though.
I'm afraid I have to start, darling.
I hate to leave our fine house.
So do I.
We never stay settled very long in a home, do we?
We will.
I'll have a fine home for you when you come back.
Say I'll come back to Catherine.
I'll come back to Catherine.
I'll always come back.
Maybe this time, you'll be hurt just a little in the foot.
Or the lobe of the ear.
Oh no. I want your ears just the way they are.
Your feet have been hurt already.
I want a ticket to Switzerland please.
- Where Senora, to what town?
- The nearest one to Italy.
- That would be Brissago.
- Then give me a ticket to Brissago.
All right.
Oh Fergie, I was afraid you wouldn't come.
Would you mind telling me what this is all about?
- I'm going away.
- So I gathered by this, but where, why.....
To Switzerland, to have a baby.
I knew he's get you in trouble. it wasn't his fault what are you going to do about it? he doesn't know it.
You didn't tell him?
What would be the good. It would only worry him and he would have to go anyway.
Aren't you going to tell him.
Well, not yet.
I may write him from Switzerland.
-You're a fool.
- Here Signora.
- On track three.
- Thank-you.
What's the hurry?
Why tonight?
I couldn't go back to that hospital.
I couldn't stand it. Not with him gone.
- But you'll be all alone in Switzerland.....
- Now don't worry Fergie, I'll be all right.
You're not afraid of anything are you?
Only of going back to that hospital.
Don't scold me Fergie.
I'll carry it.
I've always told you I was a crazy girl.....
I couldn't bear Milan while you were away.
So, I've chucked the war and come to live in this little Swiss town....
......as near as possible to the
Italian border..... and you.
And darling, it's an adorable place and we'll be very happy here.
I've taken a suite....
....in the best hotel.
And I am fairly wallowing in luxury.
The bed is Empire and fit for an empress.
There is a maroon velvet carpet, ankle deep.......
....and a bathroom, or darling the bathroom.
It's a black marble, with silver fittings.
I've just dined in state, at my sitting- room window.
From which there is a divine view of the lake, shimmering in moonlight.
I'm an awful liar darling.....
It's not really a nice place at all. It's mean, cheap and horrible.
But it doesn't matter where I live....
....because I don't really live at all, when I'm not with you.
Darling....
What I really want to tell you is...
......I shall lie awake in the dark and cry because you are not here.
I'm lonely and frightened.
And I love you.
-Hurry baby.
- Why?
- It's time to go.
- Go where?
But I told you before to the Villa
Rosa. New girls. Everybody is going.
No, not me.
But you must. It will be a fine party and besides I said that you would go.
I can't. I've got to write a letter.
To that little......everyday, more letters. You might as well be married.
That's my business.
Oh baby. How are you ever going to come back to me?
Serious, like a shopkeeper with a liver. Where is my war brother, who used to get drunk with me....
......and go to the Villa Rosa every night?
Leave me alone, will you?
Why? Isn't she just a girl?
Keep her out of this.
Secrets. Believe me baby.....
...secrets subjects are not good for soldiers.
Why don't you be like me? All fire and smoke.
And nothing inside.
- Come on baby.
- You're drunk, stop it.
Of course I am drunk. You come with me and you will be drunk too.
Come on baby.
Oh, I am sorry. Now you must come. There is no more ink.
Get your hands off me and get out!
Poor baby....
Tomorrow I will get you drunk, and I will take out your liver
...and I will put you in a good Italian liver and make a man of you again.
Ciao baby
You're going out Senor Capitano?
Yes, why?
The mail just came, Senor
Capitano.
You censure it.
Senor Capitano.....the officers' mail too?
- Aren't you going to open them
Senor Capitano? - No!
I'm in a hurry.
- Send this one back.
- Yes, Senor Capitano.
I do not like to see himself lose his head over a woman.
Yes Senor Capitano.
And today my letters came back.
Everyone that I'd ever written to her.
Came back?
Just marked return to sender.
Person unknown.
Well, that's very strange.
-32 letters. She never got one.
- Well, that's why she never wrote you.
No, she'd have written me anyway.
Something's happened to her.
- Have you tried......
- I can't get any information at all.
- I've got to go and find her, myself.
- Now, can you?
I'm going to Milan.
I'll find her.
Leave of absence forbidden since that battle in the north again.
- I'm going anyway.
- that's desertion.
- I don't care, I'm going.
- You'll be caught.
- You mustn't do this Frederico
- Yes I must.
That's what I wanted to tell you padre.
What does this war mean to me anymore?
What does anything mean, but finding her.
- But Frederico, consider the.......
- I can depend on you padre?
Say good-bye to Rinaldi and the others for me.
- When are you leaving?
- Now.
While they are at dinner. And by morning when they miss me, I'll be halfway to Milan.
If they ask me.....what do I say...what....
Anything you like.
- Good-bye Father.
- Good-bye Frederico.
May the Lord bless and preserve you.
What are you doing in the yards?
- Looking for stragglers.
- What do you do with them?
Send them back to fight invaders.
Every foot of Italian soil must be regained.
- Suppose they don't want to go back?
- Then we shoot them?
Who's there?
Where's Catherine?
- What are you doing back here?
- Where's Cathy?
I know you. You run away. You're a deserter.
- Where is she? I've got to see her.
- You can't. She's gone.
- Gone! Where?
- You'd better get out.
Has she been transferred?
If you don't get out of here, I'll scream and bring the whole hospital down on you.
- Why'd she go. Where? Tell me.
- No!
Tell me where she is! go ahead and choke me, but I won't tell, you've done her enough harm. what do you mean?
I said you'd get her into trouble.
I hate you.
I hate you, understand? I won't tell you anything.
I hope they catch you.
I hope they shoot you.
To pay you back for what you've done to her. Making her have a baby.
Baby?
I warned you, but you didn't care.
Not about her.
- Now she's had to go away.
- Where?
Where? For pity's sake, tell me.
- Fergie!
- No!
No, no!
And get me some clothes. A full outfit. I can't go around in this uniform.
As long as I don't get mixed up in it myself.
You won't. I just want you to get some things and put an advertisement in the newspaper for me.
I really oughtn't to, if I had any sense.
I know I shall have awful gas pains in the morning as a result of this.
Just say......
Catherine, where are you?
I am free at last.
Meet me at the Palace Hotel,
Stressa.
Signed Frederic.
The Major made an obituary speech in your memory and the priest wanted to say mass for your soul.
Vermouth. One for you?
Two vermouth.
You see, we all thought you were dead.
It never occurred to us that you could be shell-shocked, wandered away, lost your memory.
How did you find me?
I saw your advertisement in the paper.
But as soon as we knew, we arranged everything.
Rinaldi will work on you, one of his miraculous cures.
You will go back a hero.
I'm not going back.
They will decorate you for bravery.
They will even promote you.
No!
I'm through the war. Get that straight.
But you can't do that. You can't say
I am through with the war.
They will not let you do that.
Two vermouth.
- Can I speak to you a moment sir?
- It's all right Harry, he's my friend.
I.......
He keeps telling me it is dangerous for me to stay here any longer.
The policeman was in tonight.
He spoke of notifying the carabiniere.
- When will they come?
- Tonight, tomorrow , who knows......but soon.
My boat is still ready sir.
Thank-you Harry.
If they arrest you, no one can save you.
- I know that.
- They will shoot you.
Look! Get this through your head,
I'm not going back!
I'm going to wait here until I can find
Catherine.
And how do you expect to do that?
I've got some people looking for her.
- If that is more important than......
- She's going to have a baby.
My baby.
So. That means everything to you.
Yes, it would.
It means that I got to find her...
... and get her out of Italy.
- Perhaps she's no longer in Italy.
- What makes you say that?
She is in Switzerland.
Where?
- Brissago.
- Brissago?
Harry!
Will you do one for me too?
Yes madame. Step around here.
No. Just the head please.
Isn't there any mail for me yet?
Ah, madame. Yes, yes today there are letters.
- Many letters.
- Many!
- 20! Well that was worth waiting for....
It is across the lake. Off course, about 55 km.
I'll make it.
- But at the frontier, there will be sentries.
- I know.
And you will have to watch out for patrol boats. I will.
- If it blows too hard......
- I won't drown.
Have you enough money? Here.
Won't you need it?
There must be a Villa Rosa in Ponte None.
Always the same girls, until they become like old friends. Like war comrades.
Take it baby, please, please.
You're a good egg.
No, I am not a good egg. I am a fool.
But, if I had understood how you felt about her......
Good luck baby.
Ciao baby.
It doesn't work.
- Should I get a new cylinder doctor?
- It is a new cylinder.
Oh I wanted so to have this baby and not make any trouble....
....and now I'm all done... All gone to pieces.
She is losing strength fast doctor.
There's no use. I'll have to operate.
That was lovely.....
...Frederic....darling.....
You mustn't worry darling.
I'm not going to die now.
I got past the place where I was going to die. practically.
Of course you are not going to die.
You mustn't think about it.
- Is she going to be all right?
- Are you her husband?
Yes.
She kept calling for you all night. lt would have been better if you'd been here.
I'm sorry.....is she in danger?
- She is very weak.
- Do you suppose I could see her now?
- Later......later.
- It won't be long.
You can't die.
Did you call?
No, I didn't say anything.
Not yet.
- Is she all right?
- I hope so.
The baby?
A boy, but it was already dead before she ever came in here.
But she'll be all right?
That's not in my hands any longer.
Go across the street and get yourself some breakfast.
You look as if you need it.
It will be some time before she can see you.
You've had children?
What was it like?
I beg your pardon? What did you say?
Nothing. Some coffee please and a brioche.
It's in the papers. Italy has won.
Thank God it's over.
This is the beginning of the end....
....but it will be a long time before they can rebuild.
In the early morning hours of
November 4th..... the Austrio-Hungarian supreme command....
..accepted the armistice conditions laid down by the General Badoglio.
Don't let her die.
Oh God, please don't let her die.
I'll do anything for you, if you don't let her die.
You took the baby......that was all right..
...but don't let her die.
Please, please dear God, don't let her die.
Her husband's out there.
Might as well let him in.
I knew he was coming.
When I went under, I knew he was here.
You won't tell him will you?
Tell him what?
That I'm going to die.
- No, we won't tell him.
- Thank-you.
Doctor......
...have I long?
Don't you see?
I have to know.
Not long.
Let him come in.
No wait.
Could I have my bag first?
Such a mess.
He never liked me to be pale.
You can go in now.
- Catherine.....
- Darling......
- You're all right?
- I'm fine.
Did you worry about me?
I came as soon as I found where you were.
Poor darling.....
Let me look at you.
You're wet and tired.....
Sit down now darling.....here.....
You're going to be all right
Catherine.
Do you want me to do anything
Cat?
- Can I get you anything?
- No.
Just talk to me.
Tell me that you haven't stopped loving me.
You know I couldn't stop.
I like to hear you say it though.
I'll never stop loving you.
Never?
Not even....
..if I died.
Never!
You'd never do odd things with any other girls or say the same things, would you? never
I want you to have other girls.
I don't want them.
That's right dear.
Try to sleep, Cat.
When I get well......
...we'll take a little house in the mountains....
We always planned a house of our own, remember?
I'll get you a fine house.
We'll live in it until the war is over.
Then you'll go back to America and be a splendid architect.
We'll be married all over again......in a church.
In a church.
Darling.....
....I'm going to die.
- Don't let me die.
- Cat!
Take me in your arms, hold me tight.
- Don't let me go........
- Catherine.
It's dark out there alone.
I don't want to leave you anymore.
I've been alone so much.
You can't die. You're too brave to die.
You're a fine girl. A brave girl.
Yes...I....
...I am a brave girl.
Whatever happens, you'll not be afraid.
I'll not be afraid.
We've never been apart. Really.
Not since we met.
Not since we met.
We never can be.
- Never parted.
- In life and in death.
Say it, Cat!
In life and in death, we'll never be parted.
You do believe that? Don't you, Cat?
I believe it...
....and I'm not afraid.
Peace.......
Peace
Hey, you up there, drop that board over here.
No, double time.
Don't go to sleep. Hurry up.
Take it over there.
Mind your ends, everybody.
- Goodbye, everybody.
- Hey, Vi.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Myra.
- Take care of yourself and good luck.
- Thank you.
- I'll get a job soon.
- Cheerio.
- Come along.
- Hey, get up there.
- Have you got a job yet, Jo?
- Oh, no.
Oh, shut up.
Celie, throw us a bit of soap.
Darling, why you've got my pants on.
I have not, these are new ones tonight.
Oh, Myra?
Here's a parcel for you.
- Dick left it.
- Oh, Myra would get it.
I wish Kevin would send me something.
- Myra.
- Oh, look, is it real?
Oh, it's just what I wanted.
How did he know what you wanted?
I don't know. Maybe I mentioned it, huh?
- Hello.
- Hello, darling, how are you?
Oh, just fine.
I'm sorry I kept you waiting.
You cost me a pretty penny already.
You know, I only bought this car for an hour.
That's nothing to what
I will cost you.
- Mind the step.
- And the chauffeur.
- Hurry, quick, before the crowds come.
Very good.
Come along now, Your Highness.
Looks like another full house tonight.
Yeah, what a sap I was to go into The Bing Boys.
I had a chance to go in Chu Chin Chow.
If I had taken it, I'd still be a chorus girl.
Now look at me.
I don't work two years.
Come on, there's nothing around here for us.
I don't know, I think one place is as good as another.
If your luck's in, it's in.
Yeah, now watch me.
Hello, Harold.
Funny, I thought I knew that chap.
Yeah.
Lovely night, huh?
Lovely night for what?
Air raids?
Those fellows up there give me the willies.
Well, they're men, aren't they?
I'd rather they throw bombs on me, than take no notice of me at all.
I expect they do that just to please you, dearie.
Come on, I'll show you my lucky window.
Here you are now. You just watch this.
See? What did I tell you?
Doing well, aren't we?
- What time is it?
- About 11:00.
I'm going down to Waterloo Bridge.
Might have some friends coming in on leave from Waterloo Station.
Well, I'll go down to Trafalgar Square.
Might be some friends of mine coming in from Downing Street.
- So long.
- Cheerio.
- Cab, lady?
- Not yet.
Come on! Hurry! Come on!
Now look at that.
Rot them zeppelins.
- What's the matter?
- Who wants to know?
Come out from there. There's a raid on.
- What are you looking for?
- What am I looking for?
What do you think I'm looking for?
My potatoes, of course.
- Don't you know there's a raid on?
- I don't care if there is.
Listen. Zeppelins.
Hear that? Zeppelins over your head.
Zeppelins, be blowed.
I want my potatoes.
Oh, what's the odd.
Hey.
What the heck do you think you're doing?
Can't you see?
We're looking for potatoes.
- Did anybody mention there's a raid on?
- Yeah, I read it in the papers.
- We're taking shelter.
- Oxygen shelter, huh?
Yeah. The old dame dropped her potatoes...
...and she wouldn't take cover until we pick them up.
Here, let me help.
Put that light out.
Do you wanna be kissed by a bomb?
Come on. Hey there. Come on, move on.
I thought that officer was gonna arrest you for that.
He didn't see.
Come on, we got them all.
Where's the cabbage?
Here you are.
- Come, let's go to the shelter.
- Confound it. The impertinence, I called it.
Over the air with their tomfool airships and these lights all ready.
Airships, indeed. At this time of night.
The government ought not to allow it.
If Mr. Gladstone was alive, it would be a very different cup of tea.
- Where are my potatoes?
- Here they are.
Oh, thank you, sir.
That's a nice little fur, dearie.
I had one like that when I was a girl.
But the moths got it.
Oh, drat it.
There go my potatoes again.
Dear me. Well, I'm off.
I can't hang around here wasting me time.
Oh, no. You're gonna stay here.
You can't go until the raid's over.
I tell you, I don't owe to the raids.
And if you wants to know, between you and me, I don't even owe to the war.
The Kaiser ain't done me no harm and I ain't done him no harm.
- Oh, dear l...
- No, no that wasn't one.
How do you mean that ain't one?
What do you think I am, deaf?
- Is this your first air raid?
- Golly, no. I've been in five or six.
- Say, are you an American?
- Say, are you a mind reader?
Yeah. Hey, listen. I'm an American too.
- Just one of the boys that couldn't wait.
- Oh, I don't know about that.
Found myself one morning with nothing to do so I thought I'd come to France.
- What for?
- Fun.
- Was it?
- No.
All clear!
Come along.
Here you are, mother.
Now you can go off home.
Thank you for nothing.
My God, what he will do when I do get home.
My old man is that jealous, you wouldn't believe.
Well, if they have anymore of this nonsense
I'll write to The Times about it.
Toodle-oo and God bless you.
- Good night.
- Bye.
Well, that's that. Thanks.
- Where were you going?
- Where do you think, Buckingham Palace?
- Can I give you a lift?
- Oh, your Rolls is around the corner, huh?
No, we'll get a taxi. What address?
- 14 Lyle Street.
- Taxi!
- Thank you.
- Yeah.
Well...
...bye.
- Don't you wanna come up for a minute?
- Why sure, that will be swell.
I haven't got a thing to drink.
That doesn't matter.
- Here.
- Oh, thank you, sir.
Here we are.
- Well, how do you like the mansion?
- Why? I think it's very comfortable.
- Yeah. Want a cigarette?
- Thanks.
Here.
Thank you.
It's a swell night, isn't it?
- There goes that signal again.
- Another raid?
Yeah.
Hurry.
- Yeah, I guess they've come back.
- Oh, you have fun here too.
Yeah.
Sit down.
Thanks.
Have an American cigarette.
I'll say I will.
Here.
Got it?
Thanks.
Have you had your dinner?
Then why don't you come and eat with me?
- Every place is closed while the raid's on.
- Oh, that's too bad.
But you can eat here.
I haven't got a thing in the place.
But there's a fish and chips shop downstairs.
- That's great. I'll go down and get some.
- Swell.
- So you're back, are you?
- Yeah.
Pleased to see me, ain't you?
What do you want?
You know perfectly well what I want.
- I want my three weeks' rent.
- I haven't got the dough.
Well, what do you expect me to do?
Subsidize you?
You're making a mistake, my girl.
You'll pay that rent or I'll find another tenant.
You think that will be easy?
Well, it's been good enough for better folks than you.
How much do I owe you?
Four pound, three and three pence.
There's the bill.
Well, I've got the three and threepence.
I don't want any of your lip.
Listen. You'll get your money.
- I'll get it for you somewhere.
- Yeah. But when?
Hey. You know the...
- This is Mrs. Hobley.
- Please to meet you, I'm sure.
- How do you do?
- Been on leave long?
I just got in tonight.
Our first leave for eight months.
Oh, isn't that lovely?
- You come to town in lots of money.
- Well, no.
Say, wasn't that somebody calling you downstairs, Mrs. Hobley?
- Good night.
- Good night.
Check the window if you find it's too drafty.
- And I hope you'll have a very happy leave.
- Thank you.
Good night, dearie.
- Well, she's a pleasant old girl.
- Yeah, isn't she?
I think I've gotten plenty of those.
- Hey. What's your name?
- Roy Cronin.
Oh, shoot. There's no more gas.
- Got a schilling, soldier?
- Sure.
- Say, what is that? A slot machine?
- Sure, it turns on the gas.
I thought maybe you were getting a package of gum.
- Remind me I owe you a schilling.
- Yeah, wouldn't it be terrible if I forgot?
- What's your name?
- Myra.
- Myra, what?
- Myra Deauville.
- Deauville. Your family French?
- Oh, no. That's just a stage name.
- What's your real name?
- Let's eat. I'm starved.
- We don't have to wait for the kettle.
- All right.
- Where do you come from?
- Lachsfeld, do you know it?
- I'll say, I do.
- Yeah?
Sure. Did you live with your people?
I did until the war broke out.
You see, my stepfather's English so he joined up.
And, of course, my mother came here with him.
- Is he nice?
- Yeah, he's grand.
He's at least ten years too old to be in uniform, but he's in it all the same.
- Tommy?
- Major, RAMC.
You see, he was a doctor.
Thanks.
- Couldn't you have gotten a commission?
- I suppose so.
- Didn't your mother want you to?
- Yeah, but it was too late.
You see, I was in summer camp in Canada.
Coming home, we stopped off in Toronto.
Gosh, things were just getting going.
Flags, bands, all that bunk.
When I woke up, I was a soldier.
You know, just boyish enthusiasm.
- Did it last?
- What?
The boyish enthusiasm.
No, you don't stay boyish very long in war.
I can see that.
Gosh, I haven't seen them in three years.
- I bet you're kind of anxious too, huh?
- Yeah, kind of. I'm taking the first train out.
- Where they live?
- They got a place down in Buckinghamshire.
- Tell me about you.
- Me?
There's the kettle.
Here, let me do that.
Clever, aren't you?
- Here.
- Thanks.
- Where do you come from?
- New York.
- Been here long?
- Four years.
- Four years. What made you come?
- Work.
- What kind of work do you do?
- I'm a chorus girl.
A chorus girl?
Oh, gee.
- You came over with a show, huh?
- Yeah, The Pink Lady.
- When it ended, The Bing Boys.
- That must be interesting.
- Yeah, when you can get it.
- Been out long?
- I certainly have.
- What a rotten break.
- And that accounts for...
- Yeah, that accounts for this rotten place.
I admit the refrigerator is old-fashioned.
- Please, I didn't mean to be critical.
- Oh, I know the place isn't the Ritz but...
Oh, you don't wanna be bothered with a hard-luck tale.
- Tell me.
- Well, jobs are hard to find...
...and rents are high, that's all.
- Behind with it?
- Gee. Let's talk about something cheerful.
- How much is it?
Well, if you must know, it's just under five pounds.
But I'll get a job soon.
Well, you see, it isn't only rent.
Price of everything has gone up so.
Why, this afternoon
I was in Leicester Square...
You know that Stag and Medals.
Anyway, there's the cutest little pink dress in the window...
...perfectly plain and simple.
- What do you think they want for it?
- What?
Three guineas.
Myra, I don't want you to take offense in anything I say...
...but, well, heck, you see, I got more money than I want as a soldier...
...and, well, couldn't
I square things up for you?
You know, with the rent and maybe get you that pink dress.
Gee, that's sweet of you.
I wouldn't think of it.
I don't see why not.
Who's to know?
Oh, it's the principle of the thing.
What's the difference?
Some of us are lucky, some of us aren't.
Just at this very minute you aren't.
Please. Go on. Take it.
It would make me so happy.
Just do it as a favor to me.
As a favor to you?
I don't know what to say, but...
- Mind you, I hate taking it.
- Thanks.
- Here.
- What?
- There's your fiver. You better go now.
- What? Myra.
You better go
I don't want your money.
Oh, I'm awfully sorry.
I didn't know you would take it like that.
Well, I told you I didn't mean to insult you and I'm sorry. L...
Well, I guess that's about all I can say.
It's a grand feeling, isn't it?
The prince and the beggar maid.
Felt very noble, didn't you?
Offering me something for nothing.
That make you feel swell, huh?
Why don't you answer me?
Well, when do we begin the next stage?
You gonna show me how to lead a better life?
Roy.
Roy.
What do you want?
Come back a minute, will you?
You don't have to care what a cheap chorus girl says to you.
Oh, I suppose it was my fault, really.
I thought you'd understand.
L...
I guess it kind of hurt you, didn't it?
Yeah.
- You want another cigarette?
- Let's smoke these.
All right.
- Do you like music?
- Why, yeah. I do.
This is from The Bing Boys.
So you're going down to see your mother tomorrow.
I'm glad. It's good for a soldier to get out of this town as quick as he can.
- What's the matter with it?
- It isn't healthy.
Only two things for a soldier to do when he's a stranger like you.
That's get drunk and get mixed up with the wrong kind of women.
That's a bug. I know the troops go wild when they get in the big city.
But that's because they got no friends.
- But you see, I'm lucky.
- Are you? Why?
- Well, I met up with you.
- That's lucky, isn't it?
- A few seconds ago, I was bawling you out.
- I forgot that.
I ought to have had more sense.
I should have known a decent girl when I saw one.
You've never been around with girls much, have you?
Not much? Why?
- When do you go back to the trenches?
- I got 14 days.
Say.
Say, have you got a man or somebody out at the front that you're interested in?
- You mean, somebody I knit socks for?
- Well, that kind of thing, yeah.
- No.
- I was thinking...
I was thinking it would be swell if you could work up a little interest in me.
Guess I could.
Even to the sock-knitting stage?
Well, I never tried knitting.
You know, I might at that.
Gee, Myra, I like you a lot.
Do you?
- Who's there?
- It's me, dear. Mrs. Hobley.
Well?
I thought perhaps you would like to know they're sounding the all clear in the streets.
Thanks.
I think I'll be going to bed now, dear.
All right.
Did you want to see me about anything, dearie?
Not now, I'll see you in the morning.
All right. Good night.
- Good night.
- Sleep well.
- She is a nice soul, that Mrs. Hobley.
- Yeah.
She's cute, isn't she?
- Looks like the raid's over, soldier.
- That mean you want me to buzz off?
- It's getting kind of late.
- All right, I'll go.
But, say, listen, Myra. I've had an idea.
How would it be if you were to come down with me tomorrow?
- What do you mean?
- Well, change will do you good.
You mean, come down to your family's?
I know you'd like them.
Come on, we'd have fun.
- How old are you, Roy?
- Nineteen, why?
- That's not very old, is it?
- I don't see what that's got to do with it.
- What do you say, will you come?
- No.
- Oh, Myra, why not?
- Can't. I gotta look for a job tomorrow.
Oh, gee. Isn't that tough?
I tell you what.
I'll come and see you before I go in the morning.
- I won't be up.
- Well, I'll wait until you get up.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
- Good night, Myra.
- Good night, Roy.
Here!
Oh, I'm sorry.
Give me a penny, mister.
Oh, give me a penny, mister.
Thank you. Oh, good morning, Mrs. Hobley.
Good morning. What can I do for you?
- Is Miss Deauville in?
- Not in here. You hop it.
You're the young fellow who's with her last night, aren't you?
- No, I'm afraid she isn't back yet.
- She's out shopping or something?
- Shopping is right.
- Perhaps I can go on up and wait.
Oh, it's nothing to do with me, you'll find the door open.
Hello.
I didn't mean to intrude. Is Myra at home?
- Well, no. But she'll be here any a minute.
- Well, I won't disturb you then.
You're not disturbing me.
I just came in myself.
- Oh, you... You've just come in?
- Yes, l...
Was Myra expecting you?
Yes, I told her I'd pop along.
You see, I live in the next house.
But I'll be toddling back now.
But that roof doesn't look like a very good place to do much toddling.
Oh, we come and go on it all the time.
If you wanna wait for Myra, why don't you come in?
- You mind?
- Not at all.
Well, look the other way then.
Sure.
It's all right, you can look now.
Oh, what lovely flowers.
- Where did these come from?
- Oh, I brought those.
You did? Well, aren't they ducky.
- I sense you're a new friend of Myra's.
- Oh, yeah, we're friends.
- Just a wartime acquaintance?
- That's it.
- You a friend of Myra's too?
- Well, yes, why we're the best.
- She and I used to work together.
- You were in The Pink Lady too.
No, no. But we've been intimate for ever so long.
Strange she hasn't mentioned you.
She has so few friends.
Well, to tell you the truth, we only just met.
- This morning?
- No, last night.
You know, I hate to think of her going through all this...
...air raids, bum food and...
I know. And she's such a little thing.
She doesn't seem to wanna talk about her affairs.
- How does she get along?
- It's a constant struggle.
And she's so lonely.
Do you know that she hasn't got a single soul that she can count on for help?
- And she does need it.
- You can tell that.
Of course, I'm devoted to her.
But then, I'm poverty-stricken myself.
You see my...
My dear husband is no more.
- I'm sorry.
- He was a soldier.
Young, handsome, full of hope.
Just like yourself.
He got his in the crater at Ypres.
Poor fellow.
But how about Mrs. Hobley?
She seems friendly.
Yeah, she seems friendly, all right.
But Mrs. Hobley's a proper whited sepulcher, I'll give you my word.
What's she gonna do now?
Myra.
She doesn't seem to be crazy about going back on-stage.
I should hope not.
The theater's no place for a nice girl like her.
Guess it isn't a very pleasant atmosphere.
- Unless...
- Unless what?
Well, you know, it's always been my hope...
...you might almost call it my dream...
...that someday, some nice young man would come along and appreciate Myra.
You know, marry her.
Give her a home.
Protect her.
Guess there hasn't been much chance of that here.
You've got it.
And that's just the danger that she is face to face with at this very moment.
How do you mean danger?
Bad influences.
You have no idea what London is like in wartime.
Why, the immorality here is ghastly.
I guess Myra can take care of herself on that.
Then how can she, when she's neglected and helpless?
And stony broke and face to face with starvation.
Is she broke?
Her condition is senseless.
- Hello, dear.
- Hello.
I didn't know anybody was here.
I just popped over and found mister...
Your friend here.
- We've been having quite a jolly little chat.
- Yes, very.
Well, I'll...
...l'll leave you two now and be toddling.
- Pleased to have met you.
- Bye.
- Cheerio, Canada.
- Goodbye.
- She been talking long?
- Only a few minutes.
I was afraid of missing you if it was any later. My train leaves at a quarter to.
I brought you some flowers, Myra.
Oh, they're lovely.
But you shouldn't have.
Bet they cleaned you out for those.
Actually, I've got something else.
I went into that shop, Stag and Medals.
You got that pink dress?
Yeah, shall I open it?
No, I don't want it.
I don't want you to give me anything.
Myra, you don't have to pretend with me.
I know you're hard up.
- Gee, that girl was just telling me...
- She doesn't know anything about it.
She doesn't know about my private income.
You've got a private income?
- Certainly.
- Where does it come from?
- From my folks back home.
- They're rich?
- Sure.
- How much do they send you?
A couple of postage stamps so you can write home.
Don't you insult my family.
They can take care of their daughter...
...wherever she is.
- I don't mean to be nasty...
...but if they send you money, why do you live in this place?
- It isn't a million dollars a year.
- I know how much it is, Myra.
It isn't a darn cent.
You've just been lying to me...
...to keep me from helping.
- What business is it of yours?
I want to know.
Who gave you the right...
...to question me about my affairs?
- I gave myself the right.
- And how did you manage to do that?
- By loving you, that's how.
Roy...
...silly...
...you can't do that.
- Oh, can't I.
- No, I say you can't, it isn't possible.
- Why isn't it possible?
- Why can't I love you?
- It's wrong...
...it's all wrong.
- Why wrong?
- It doesn't fit in, you loving me.
- My dear...
...I wouldn't care if you were in a thousand shows of the circus. I love you.
Yeah.
Wait until you get back, then see how much you think about me.
- Are you thinking about your family?
- What?
Well, I mean... I mean is it just because I'm a common private?
Yes, Roy.
That's one of the things I'm thinking about.
Why, I'd be ashamed even to introduce you to my people...
...if they were living, which they aren't, thank God.
And do you wanna know why I'd be ashamed?
Because my mother and father were a couple of drunken sots.
And they lived in East St. Louis, an exclusive suburb.
That's where I came from.
I ran away and went on the stage because
I was scared to stay in my own home.
I was scared that they would kill me when they were liquored.
That's how much aristocracy I am.
And you talk about me being lonely.
Me...
...with everything I've got.
That's it, Roy.
- You've got enough in your own life.
- Yes, but...
...what have you got, Myra?
What have you...?
No, I can take care of myself.
Myra...
...you said there was nobody else.
- There isn't.
- Did there used to be?
- I never loved anyone.
Then I'm not gonna stand here and argue anymore about it.
Don't hold your head like that.
Look at me.
Oh, Roy.
Don't say anything more, sweetheart.
I know how it is.
You just didn't want me to get into this.
You thought I might regret it someday.
Well, that's all right.
I'm not going to regret this ever.
Ever.
I guess I know who it is I love.
Roy.
- You'll miss your train.
- Yeah, I...
...I guess I better had be going now.
But listen, darling.
I'm coming back for you.
- What do you mean?
- I'm coming back to see you.
I'll be back just as soon as I can get away.
I...
Hello, ducky. Come on in.
What have you been saying to him?
I've been telling him nothing that wasn't good for him to hear.
I've been singing your blooming praises, all right.
I was hoping he'd come and go away.
Not him. He waited to hear all the information I had to give him about you.
Yeah, and what was that?
That you was a poor, lonely, little girl.
Half-starved and hungry for love.
The only thing on God's Earth, I said, that can save her is a husband.
- A husband?
- Yes.
And he's willing to step up and do his duty, by king and country.
And what's more, I'm prepared to be your bridesmaid and help you blush.
Did he say that he'd marry me?
Well, not quite...
...but he was coming to it when you burst in and interrupted.
- He's yours, I tell you.
- What if I don't want him?
Well, what if you don't?
What's the harm?
All you have to do is go through with the ceremony...
...collect his separation allowance, and live in luxury.
Then there's your insurance, if he gets knocked off in action.
I don't want his insurance...
...and I'm not gonna steal his pay.
Who says it's stealing?
Marriage is legal, ain't it?
Why, it's early.
Look at Agnes Ellen.
She's got four husbands in the army.
Two Australians, one Yorkshire man, and her own husband.
She's collecting separation allowances from all of them.
And what's more, she's making them all happy.
Of course, there is the risk that two or three of her husbands...
...might get leave at the same time.
But that shouldn't bother you with only one on your hands.
Look here,
I put you in the way of a good thing.
It's a stinking thing, Kitty.
What's stinking about it, I'd like to know?
He loves you, don't he?
Of course, he does.
Look at the flowers he's brought you.
He don't even know me.
And he never will, if I have to jump in the river to keep him from finding out.
You've bloody well gone queer in your head, haven't you?
Maybe.
Now, what do you think of this port, Roy?
- Pretty good, Roy?
- Seems fine to me.
Seems fine to me.
- But I don't know very much about wines.
- That's a pity.
They tell me some people in your country are trying to do away with wine altogether.
Curious idea.
Oh, that's all nonsense, darling.
It's just a lot of talk.
Nothing will come of it.
You mustn't believe all you see in the papers.
We're not as bad as all that.
Of course, I don't know America very well.
I was only in the place two or three weeks, but they...
They seemed to be sane and responsible sort of people.
No, I don't want any of that.
Here, Hives.
Pass the port, Jenny.
- Have some more, Roy.
- No more for me, thanks.
No, thank you.
Does it feel good to be home, darling?
- Swell.
- By the way...
...when you were in the Cambridge sector, did you come across an old friend of mine?
- Who was that, sir?
- Old Plumsteed.
- Charlie Plumsteed.
- Was he a private?
No, he was a brigadier.
No, sir, no, I don't run across many of those.
No, I don't suppose you do, but you may have met his son.
Did you ever meet old Plumsteed's son?
You know, young Plumsteed.
- He's a second lieutenant, isn't he?
- Yes, I think he is.
I remember coming across him at the base on the way home.
Roy, don't be cynical.
He's not cynical.
Somebody has to be at the base.
You're very silent, Mary.
That's because I have nothing to say.
I'm just enjoying myself, trying to realize Roy is back home.
Yes, nice having him, isn't it?
You must come again soon.
I hope, though, I haven't got that silly.
You can't come until they let you.
Listen, now I can tell you what I want to tell you.
- It's about a girl.
- About a what?
Well, about a girl.
I don't know what he's talking about.
A girl, darling, you know, a girl. A girl.
Yeah, yeah, yes, I know, a girl is.
Well, what about it, boy?
- Tell me about her, Roy.
- Well, there isn't much to tell, Mother.
It all sounds rather silly.
You see, I've only known her a few hours.
I met her on my way through.
Come on, Jenny, don't go to sleep with that port, pass it.
- It's under your nose, darling.
- What?
Your nose.
See, things do happen pretty quickly now.
I mean, they have to.
You know, with the war on, you never know where you're gonna be next.
Well, the fact is I do like her. Terribly.
- What's her name?
- Myra.
- Myra what?
- Myra Deauville.
That's not her real name, of course.
She's on the stage.
- Who introduced you to her?
- Nobody.
We met by accident during an air raid.
She a well-known actress?
Well, no, but she's awfully pretty.
Actually, she is only in the chorus.
She's had it pretty tough lately, you know.
- Couldn't get a job in one thing or another.
- What a shame.
Well, what I wanted to know...
...I mean, what I wanted to ask is...
- What did you want to ask, Roy?
- I wondered if you'd hate very much...
...if we couldn't have her down here for a while.
- Would you like that?
- It would be grand.
I wouldn't suggest it if I didn't think you'd like her.
I know she's a chorus girl, but she's different.
- I'm sure I shall like her.
- That means I can ask her?
As far as I'm concerned, it does.
- Do you mind, Fred?
- Do I mind what?
If we ask this girl down here for a day or two?
I haven't heard a word you've been talking about.
- Oh, Fred.
- You mumble so. Well, what is it?
I'll tell him, Mother.
- Listen, Roy met...
- Oh, don't shout. I can hear perfectly well.
He met a girl last night in an air raid.
An air raid? A funny place, what.
And he fell for her. Hook, line and sinker.
Now, what he wants to know is...
I haven't the least idea what she's talking about.
''Two plain, two pearl...
...two plain, two pearl, two plain, two pearl... ''
- Good morning.
- Hello.
- You're back soon.
- I caught an early train.
Would you go for a ride in the country with me?
It's such a lovely day.
What do you say?
I'm afraid I can't make it.
We'll go anywhere you like.
- Well, that sounds good.
- Then it's settled.
Where would you like to go?
Well, what about Hampton Court?
No, let's go further off than that.
All right.
- Go anywhere you like.
- Come on then.
Where's your hat?
Wait a minute.
- Good. I'll wait for you outside.
- All right.
Oh, look, Buckingham Palace.
Looks like King George is giving a tea party.
Whoa.
Would you like to get out and walk for a little?
- Sure, let's.
- Say, listen, we're gonna walk a while.
Very good.
- Will you wait here for us, please?
- Very good.
- Oh, boy.
- Like it?
- It's all right for us to be here?
- Of course, why?
- Well, it looks kind of private.
- I expect it's all right.
You know, it looks almost like a garden.
But, Roy, surely this is a garden.
Well, what's the difference if it is?
- Nobody will kick us out in wartime.
- I don't suppose.
Shall we sit down?
- Here?
- Yeah.
All right.
Myra...
...there's something
I want to talk to you about.
- Yeah, what?
- Well, you see...
...things aren't quite the same in wartime.
I mean, you do things in a, you know, well...
...a less leisurely fashion.
You know what I mean?
No.
Well, what I mean is people make up their minds more quickly.
And...
...l've made up my mind about something.
- Yeah, what?
- I've made up my mind that it'd be grand...
...if you'd marry me.
Well, Myra?
You just don't know what you're talking about.
That's not an answer.
Please...
...don't look away from me.
Give me an answer.
No, I won't marry you, Roy.
Thank you.
I see.
- Myra, you're crying.
- Not really.
Are you unhappy?
A little.
Darling, you needn't be.
I could look after you.
I could make you happy,
I know I could.
- Could you, Roy?
- Sure.
Won't you change your mind?
Hello, Roy!
- Hello.
- Who's that?
- That's my sister.
- Who's that with her?
My mother and stepfather.
- Oh, Roy, how could you that? I'm going.
- L...
- Oh, no, Myra please.
- Please, let me go.
- Please, please, you gotta stay.
- No, no.
- Hello, darling.
- Hello, Mother.
- Good morning, Roy.
- Good morning, sir.
- This is Myra, that I told you about.
- How do you do?
- My sister, Janet.
- How do you do?
- My stepfather, Major Wetherby.
- What?
- Major Wetherby!
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
- I'm so glad you let Roy bring you down.
Let's come along now.
Where's your luggage?
Oh, I haven't any luggage. I can't stay.
- She says she can't stay.
- Oh, nonsense.
Oh, that's too bad.
Roy said he was bringing you down for several days.
- He shouldn't have. I never told him that.
- It's my fault.
She didn't know where she was coming.
I couldn't persuade her. I tricked her.
Oh, what a shame.
Roy, that's very naughty of you.
But now that you're here, you must stay.
I've got everything you want.
We're about the same size.
That's right. Come on, let's go.
Did you have a pleasant ride coming down?
This place is no distance from town by car.
Of course, it was a different thing in the old horse days...
...but then, cars and carriages are very different things.
Very different. Old Plumsteed often used to say the same thing.
Totally different things, that's what I always say.
Extraordinary how few good people understand that.
I had an argument with old Plumsteed once on the very subject.
He took the point of view that carriages are more comfortable...
...but cars were bigger. What?
Good piece it was too.
I remember it well.
I saw it twice, I think.
Well, what was it called?
- The Bing Boys.
- The what?
- The Bing Boys!
- Yes, something like that.
The fellow that was in it...
...what was his name?
- George Robey?
- George what?
- George Robey!
- Yes, I forget his name.
But he was a funny chap.
I remember he had comic eyebrows.
Do you remember his eyebrows?
I was always a bit interested in the stage.
That fellow, Irving.
What was the piece he used to play...
Oh, you wouldn't remember it, it was before your time.
He played two parts.
He used to change his clothes a whole lot of times.
By George, that was acting, that was.
Talking about acting reminds me, I had a niece who wanted to go on the stage.
I don't think anything came of it, I think she got married or something or other.
Well, you can't do everything, as old Plumsteed used to say.
I suppose this business of acting isn't so easy as it looks.
Some people can, and some people can't, what?
Well, there's no need for me to tell you that.
- Fortune.
- Thanks.
Well done, Fred,
I didn't know you were so active.
Jan, you need a baseball field, not a tennis court.
I'll take you on afterwards.
We'll see how good you are.
Come on, come on, come on.
I'm waiting to serve.
Sorry.
Janet used to be quite good.
The child's out of practice.
- Oh, yes.
- Forty-thirty. Good service, Jan.
- Were you ready, sir?
- No, I wasn't.
I'll have two more then.
Bad luck, very well tried.
- That's the game end, isn't it?
- I'm afraid it is.
That girl is too good for me.
You take her on, Roy.
- All right.
- Have a nice, cold drink.
- What?
- Lemonade.
Lemonade? No, that stuff's no good to me.
I'm gonna get a whiskey and soda.
You played very well, darling.
You deserved to win.
Well, I don't know so much.
I had the sun in my eyes most of the time.
- Do you play this silly game, my dear?
- No, I'm afraid not.
Well, you can't do everything, can you?
Some people do and some people don't, as old Plumsteed used to say.
I'm just gonna have to have a cold bar.
Roy was talking to me about you last night, Myra.
- Was he?
- He's very much in love with you.
Yeah, I suppose so.
He told me he wanted to marry you.
- Did you know that?
- Yeah, I know.
Would you like me to tell you quite honestly what I said to him?
- Oh, I don't mind.
- I asked him not to.
I thought I'd like to tell you that quite simply.
It seemed nicer for you.
- What did he say?
- He wouldn't listen to me.
Did you say anything about me being a chorus girl?
I told him that you had both led very different kinds of lives...
...that you might find you hadn't much in common.
Why are you telling me all this?
Are you trying to ask me to give him up?
I just wanted you to know what I felt about it.
After all, we know it's in both our minds.
It seems silly not to talk about it, doesn't it?
I suppose so.
I want you to think about it very carefully, Myra.
I will.
Has what I said made you unhappy?
No.
Oh, there's tea. Shall we go in?
Come in.
Oh, hello, Myra.
Haven't you gone to bed yet?
No.
It's rather a warm night, isn't it?
Do you want to talk to me about something?
- Yes.
- Come and sit down.
No, I'm all right here.
I just wanted you to know...
...I could marry him if I wanted to.
I know, my dear.
Look...
...I just wanted you to know that.
Yes, I know, Myra.
You see, I happen to know you're rather a fine girl.
Fine?
I'm not.
About things like that, my dear,
I never make mistakes.
I want to tell you something.
Something I couldn't tell Roy.
What is it, Myra?
I'm not a chorus girl at all.
I make my living...
I...
I picked Roy up on Waterloo Bridge.
Does Roy know that?
No.
You came and told me.
You see, I told you you're a fine girl.
But I could've married him if I wanted to.
I know, my dear.
Well, why don't you ask me not to?
I don't need to.
Do you love him?
Good morning, miss.
Good morning.
Do you take sugar and milk in your tea, miss?
Yeah, one lump, please.
- Did you rest well, miss?
- Yes, thanks.
Shall I turn on your bath, miss?
Thanks.
A cold bath, miss?
Oh, no, hot.
Very well, miss.
- The German casualties seem pretty heavy.
- What is it?
The German casualties seem pretty heavy!
Are you deaf?
Must have been a tough year for them.
- Gosh, they must have lost thousands.
- What?
- They must have lost thousands.
- Yes, poor devils.
Decent fellows too, some of them.
I used to know one. He was at Cambridge with old Plumsteed and me.
A fellow called Heinrich or some such name.
Quite a good fellow, he used to play a good game of rugger.
His face was all cut up.
He used to fight duels in Heidelberg or some such dreadful place.
Very unbecoming.
More coffee, Mary...
The family is in the breakfast room, miss.
Oh, thanks.
- Myra.
- Good morning, Myra.
- Come and sit down, Myra.
- Thank you.
- Here.
- Will you have tea or coffee, Myra?
Coffee, please.
- Well, did you sleep well?
- All right, thank you.
All right, thank you.
Myra, fish, or bacon and eggs?
- Bacon and eggs, please.
- Coming up.
I was saying the German casualties seem to have been very heavy.
I was telling them I used to be at Cambridge with one of them.
A fellow called Heinrich something or other.
Quite a decent fellow.
Lord knows, he used to play a good game of rugger.
- Here are your bacon and eggs.
- Thanks.
- Hope you're feeling energetic, Myra.
- In a what?
- I hope she's feeling energetic.
- Yes, yes.
We're leaving immediately after breakfast.
Oh, I'm afraid I can't go.
- Myra.
- No, I've got to be in London.
Oh, but you must come to Camden with us.
Why, it's perfectly lovely.
And you said you'd never seen it.
- I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I can't do it.
- Oh, listen, this was all arranged yesterday.
Here's your coffee, darling.
You must come with us, Myra.
Why, of course she must.
You don't suppose
I'm going to Camden without her.
Motoring all day with my own family?
Not likely.
Come along, Myra.
You don't need a wrap.
Hurry up, children. Get ready for the ride.
- Don't be long, darling.
- All right, I won't be 10 minutes.
Oh, Augusta...
...tell Simpkins to bring around the car, please.
Very good, madam.
- We're going to have a lovely day, Myra.
- Oh, Mrs. Wetherby.
You didn't tell them what I told you last night?
Of course not.
We're not fighting each other.
Run along now and get ready.
- What time is the London train?
- Due now.
Thank you.
- Third class single for London, please.
- Eighteen ninety-three.
London train.
London train.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Excuse me,
I seem to have forgotten your name.
- I know we've met somewhere.
- Yeah, that's right.
Your face is familiar too.
- What are you doing this evening?
- Looking for a good time...
...and wondering where the rent's coming from.
Well, maybe I can be of some use to you in both those little points.
Guess I know a gentleman when I see one.
You know, when anybody's in trouble,
I like to help them out.
Would a quid cover the rent?
£2.10, it is.
Rent's come pretty high these days.
Oh, well, I daresay we can manage it.
Let's call a cab.
Hi, cabby.
Oh, buzz off, will you.
Why, what's the matter?
Do you hear me? I don't want you.
Did you get that?
Now, go on, get out.
Cabby.
Take it to the hotel.
Oh, I didn't mean it, mister.
I didn't mean it.
I didn't mean it, mister.
Come on, ducky.
Oh, so, you're back.
That Canadian was here this morning asking for you.
If he comes back, tell him I'm out.
Don't let him up.
Yes, that's all very well, but what about my rent.
Here.
There's the rent for a week.
That's all I could manage.
Oh, well, I suppose that's something.
- Where did you come from?
- I've been waiting in that girl's room.
- You can't stay here.
- Myra, I gotta see you now.
All leaves have been canceled. I've gotta catch the 10:27 tonight from Waterloo.
- Why don't you say something?
- What is there to say?
Tell me why you ran away like that.
What was the matter, did I do anything?
- No.
- Was anybody unkind to you?
- No.
- Well, why did you do it? Why?
- Were you running away from me?
- Yes, Roy.
- What's the matter? Don't you like me?
- Oh, yes.
- Please go now.
- I don't understand.
I love you more than anything in all the world. There can't ever be anybody else.
I can't ever get you out of my mind.
I love you, Myra.
Leave me alone. Get away.
Go out of here. Leave me alone.
I never wanna see you again. I hate you.
I hate your mother and your family and all of you. I hate you.
I was happy here until you came.
Do you hear me?
I was happy here, I was.
Oh, why can't you leave me alone?
What do you think you've got to give me?
Nothing. Nothing!
Oh, look at you.
Oh, if you could see yourself, you'd laugh as I'm laughing now.
You'd laugh. You'd laugh.
You'd laugh, you'd laugh, you'd laugh, you'd laugh!
Honey, what is it?
Tell me.
Oh, your...
Your nerves are all shot.
Yeah.
Yeah, that's it. It's my nerves.
Here, you'll be all right soon.
There, now. You're gonna be all right.
Oh, you poor kid.
There. Now see?
See? You're all right now.
Yeah.
- Yeah, I'm all right now.
- Sure.
Darling...
...you love me, don't you?
- Oh, yes.
- Then listen.
I want you to do something for me.
Now, if you say no...
...it's just gonna break my heart.
All right, I'll do it.
- Do you know what it is?
- No, but I'll do it.
Well, I want you to marry me.
Now. Today.
Before I have to catch that train.
Darling...
...you said you'd do it.
All right. I'll do it.
Here you go. You better get dressed.
Here.
Will you wait outside for me?
Sure.
Oh, it's you.
Oh, allow me, Mrs. Hobley.
Well.
- Nice day.
- You seem to think so.
Dear.
Hey, Myra?
Myra?
Myra?
Where is she? Where is she?
Where is she? Look at that window.
You know as well as I do where, she's hopped it. That's where is she.
She had to get away without facing me, so she's bolted.
- Why without facing you?
- You know, you hypocrite.
- It's a conspiracy to fraud me.
- Did she owe you money?
Did she owe me money?
Don't you think you can pull wool over my eyes, young man, because I won't have it.
I'll have the police on both of you.
I won't be cheated and robbed by you and that soldier's girl.
- What did you call her?
- What she is.
- What you know she is.
- Aren't you careless about what you say?
No. I'm choosing my words careful.
More careful than I choose my lodgers.
Because I make no complaints. You think you can cheat me, insult me, rob me.
But you can't.
You and your fancy girl neither.
I don't know whether you know, but there's law in this land.
How much does she owe you?
- You mean, you'll pay me?
- That's what I mean.
Oh, well, I must say you're a gentleman then.
More than I say for most of her friends.
I asked you how much she owes you.
Well, there's £2.89 since last April...
...and there's a week's advance now.
- What's the rent here?
- For this room?
Thirty shillings a week.
Forty and 30 is 70. And 18 did you say?
- Yes, quite correct, sir.
- Eighty-eight shillings.
- That's £4.08.
- Yes, that's what I make it.
Here's 6 pounds.
That'll pay you what she owes you and two weeks in advance.
Oh, thank you, sir. And God bless you.
- Please give me a receipt.
- Yes, gladly, sir.
- Make it out that you received it from her.
- Yes, sir.
There you are, sir.
Where would I be likely to find her?
Oh, anywhere along The Strand,
Leicester Square, Piccadilly.
Then there's always Waterloo Bridge.
A good many other hangs about there to try and get the soldiers coming in on leave.
- How odd. Did you notice it?
- What?
She seems to have left a note.
- For me?
- Don't say who it's for.
Just says, ''I can't do it. Goodbye.''
That's all.
Of course, it's none of my business, sir, what you do and what you don't do...
...but I know her and I know her kind to make cost.
And if you take my advice, when you do see her, you'll take that receipt...
...and you'll throw it in her painted face and then you'll have no more to do with her.
But traffic with women like her only leads to sin, and sin leads to suffering...
...and a soldier like you should have enough of suffering in this war...
...without being contaminated and robbed by the likes of...
Just shut your dirty face!
Can you help me out, governor?
Here you are, governor.
Come on, governor. Can you help me out?
Come on, governor.
Here you are. Here you are.
What do you think this is, the Garden of Eden?
We had a lovely time in France.
Hey, what do you mean?
- Overhead. Take cover.
Take cover.
Myra, I've been looking for you for hours.
Why'd you come here? It's not safe.
I wanted to see you pass by.
I didn't think you'd notice me.
Listen, I've only got 10 minutes to catch my train.
Here, take this.
I've seen Mrs. Hobley. It's a receipt for your rent. It covers two weeks in advance.
Here's some money to keep you going for a week.
Once I get to the front, I'll arrange my pay and everything...
...and then, if anything happens to me, well, you'll be all right.
Roy...
...do you know why
I've been trying not to marry you?
Mrs. Hobley told me.
Told you everything?
Myra, I don't care. You gotta marry me.
It wasn't your fault. You had to do it.
It's all over now, Roy.
Catching the 10:27 train with us?
- Come on, lady, you've gotta move him.
- It's all right, officer. He's coming.
I'll catch it if you promise to marry to me.
If you don't all the MPs won't make me catch that train.
Tell your friend you'll marry him.
You don't wanna get a soldier shot, do you?
Come on, governor.
Hook us up...
- You better go, Roy.
- Will you marry me?
She'll marry you.
Now, soldier, come with me.
Myra, will you?
If you hang around here much more, we're all gonna get blown up...
...and it won't matter if she marries you or not.
Myra.
All right, Roy.
I'll marry you.
Goodbye.
Goodbye, darling.
I'll think of you always.
Every minute.
Come on, sonny.
Cheerio, darling.
Heigh-ho.
Goodbye, Roy.
- One more minute and we'll be going over.
- The men are ready, sir.
Private Laurel.
You stay here and guard this post until relieved from duty.
Gee, I wish I was going with you.
Take care of yourself.
Don't worry about me, Stan.
I'll be back. We'll all be back.
So long, pal.
You brainless idiot!
What are you trying to do?!
- Put that thing down!
- War is war and I've got my orders.
- What orders?
- To guard this post.
You block-head!
The war's been over for 20 years.
It doesn't make any difference.
When I'm told to do something...
- What d'you say?
- The war's been over for 20 years.
Eh?
The war's been over for 20 years!
Ha! How time flies.
Just seems like yesterday.
- What d'you say?
- You heard me.
- Well, that accounts for it.
- Accounts for what?
Everything's been kinda quiet lately.
Come with me. I'll see that you get home.
War's been over for...
Well, it's better than staying here.
Thanks very much. Are you sure the war's been over for 20 years?
Positively. I can prove it to you.
If it isn't, somebody's going to get into an awful jam.
Paper! Morning paper!
Were the eggs done enough this morning, dear?
Is there anything else, dear?
I almost burned my finger on the bacon this morning.
My love, you've got something on your mind.
You can't fool your baby Oliver.
Oh, Oliver! You don't even remember what happened a year ago today.
Was that the day I fell off the bicycle?
No, Oliver. Now just try to think.
It had something to do with you and me.
I give up. I can't quite remember what you mean.
Unless it was the day we got married... That's it!
It was just a year ago today that you came into my heart.
How could I forget?
Congratulations, Mrs Hardy.
Of course I didn't forget.
We'll celebrate. We'll have a party.
Oh, Oliver!
How I've looked forward to this day.
I planned a dinner just for the two of us, as I did a year ago tonight.
- You're so sweet and I'm such a cad.
- No, you're not.
We'll do anything your little heart desires.
We'll have a nice quiet dinner and after that, we'll sit and hold hands and I'll whisper sweet nothings in your ear.
Oh, Oliver!
This is wonderful. And you are so wonderful.
Could I have an extra dollar with my allowance?
Isn't 75 cents a day enough for you?
Usually it is but today is different.
I wish you wouldn't ask me what I'm going to do with it. It's to be a surprise.
Oh, Oliver, of course.
You can have a dollar and 25 cents more... today.
There's one more thing.
Do you mind if I use the car?
I'll only be gone one hour.
Of course not.
But be careful and hurry right back.
Thank you. I won't even say goodbye, my precious little Fig Newton.
I'll just say, pardon me for one hour.
And make that hour short.
- Good morning, Mrs Gilbert.
- Good morning, Mr Hardy.
Gorgeous day, isn't it? Bright, cheerful.
- It's a lovely day.
- This is quite a day for me.
My anniversary... and Mrs Hardy's too.
- Oh, how nice! Congratulations.
- Thank you.
I have reason to celebrate. Mr Gilbert is due back after two months hunting in Africa.
Oh, fine! Then we both have a reason to celebrate. Congratulations.
- Thank you.
- Oh. It's all right. I'll get them.
Hello, darling. This is Mr Hardy.
My husband, Mr Gilbert.
How do you do?
You came back unexpectedly.
Yes. You see, we were holding hands...
We were shaking hands and the newspapers fell out.
Well, I guess we can get up now.
I guess we'd better be going. Goodbye.
I'm glad to have seen you.
Excuse me. My mistake. I'm sorry.
Oh. There you are.
Goodbye. Oh... Goodbye, Mr Gilbert.
- And who is that snake?
- Mr Hardy. He's our neighbour.
Come in, dear.
It's so nice to have you home.
Good morning, James.
What's the news this morning?
A fella stayed in the trenches
20 years after the war.
- He didn't know it was over!
- How could anyone be so stupid?
I don't know. Here's his picture.
I can't imagine anybody being that dumb.
Oh, yes, I can!
(Deep voice) Out, please.
- (Deep voice) Thank you.
- Quite all right, sir.
Down, please.
I don't see him just now but you'll find him on the grounds somewhere.
Thank you.
- Ollie!
- Stan! Don't get up now. Sit right there.
- How did you know I was here?
- I saw your picture in the paper.
- How did I look?
- You haven't changed a bit.
Neither have you. If I hadn't have seen you,
I never would have known you.
- Gee, I'm glad to see you.
- I'm glad to see you too.
- Have you missed me?
- I certainly have.
I missed you too.
How's things and everything?
Everything's just fine. I got married.
You don't tell me? Who d'ya marry? Fifi?
- No.
- Er, Lulu?
- No.
- Camille?
- No.
- I know. Fanny.
No. You wouldn't know her.
She's a local girl.
Wait till you meet her. She's one of the finest women that ever lived.
- Don't tell.
- And can she cook!
- Can she?
- Can she?
Wait till you put your legs under that table... Pardon me.
Wait till you put your leg under that table and put your teeth into a big, thick, juicy steak covered with mushrooms and those hot biscuits oozing with molten butter.
And those seven-layered chocolate cakes swimming in whipped cream.
- Any beans?
- You can have beans if you want.
- You can have anything you want.
- (Bugle call)
It was nice of you to call, Ollie.
I hope you'll come see me again sometime.
I've got to be going.
- Where are you going?
- It's call for mess. I've got to eat.
You're coming home with me to meet the missus.
- Am I?
- And have a big, thick, juicy steak.
- Thank you, Ollie.
- You're welcome.
I want you to remember - from now on, my home is your home.
- Thank you, Ollie.
- You're welcome.
And I'm never going to let you out of my sight again.
- Thank you, Ollie.
- You're welcome.
Just sit back and relax.
I'm sure glad to see you, kid.
Gee, Ollie. This is just like old times.
You and I being together.
You took the words right out of my mouth.
- We sure used to have a lot of fun.
- We sure did.
- You remember how dumb I used to be?
- Yeah.
- I'm better now.
- I'm certainly glad to hear it.
- Will you wait a minute, Ollie?
- Why?
- I want a drink of water.
- You sit right there. I'll get it.
- I only want to get to the faucet.
- How can you get there?
You just sit and relax. I'll be right back.
Hey! Come on, lug. Get outta that chair.
What do you mean insulting my friend?
That's my buddy's chair.
I'll give it to you when I'm ready.
- Is that so?
- Yes, that's so.
Well, are you ready to give it to me?
On second thought, yes.
Don't exert yourself, Stanley. I'll carry you.
Are you comfortable?
Thank you, Stanley.
We haven't got much further to go now.
- Well, here we are.
- Is this your car?
No, it belongs to the missus.
- Sure is a pretty one.
- It's practically new.
Look, you can see yourself in it.
That's... No, I got it. That way.
- Now I'm nearly in.
- All right.
There's one...
Come here!
Why didn't you tell me you had two legs?
You didn't ask me.
- Get in the car!
- I've always had 'em.
You are better now? Hm!
Go and get the guy to move that truck.
Go on.
- The guy isn't there.
- Well, move it yourself.
Hold it. Steady. Thank you.
You can say that that was the largest boar ever bagged in India.
Kept me two months extra months away.
- I'll bet there's a story behind it.
- You said it.
He gave me more trouble than a bunch of elephants.
It's safer to hunt on horseback but I was on foot when he charged me.
When he got close enough, I fired.
The gun jammed. It was a narrow escape.
But what did you do?
To look at me, you wouldn't believe that I am very light on my feet.
- I jumped to one side.
- You were in a spot.
But not for long.
If you keep cool, everything is all right and I was cool - I had a chill in my back.
I took out both of my revolvers and I let him have 12 shots. Six and six.
He almost made you a widow, Mrs Gilbert.
I never worry about my husband.
When he takes aim, it's a bullseye.
Unlike other hunters,
I don't bring 'em back alive.
I bring 'em back dead. I come back alive.
Did you get those elephant tusks in India?
No. In Africa. I was with my safari...
"Safari" means a bunch of native boys.
I had my lion gun with me - that's smaller than an elephant gun.
When jumbo came charging after me,
I let him have the full magazine.
You think that bothered him?
That made him angry. It made him mad!
He pulled over five or six trees.
He charged again. I took aim.
And I let him have it.
- I'll be that did the trick.
- Well, there's his teeth.
I've got to go down to the gun shop. I'm having a new gun made especially for me.
I mean, for elephants. Goodbye, dear.
- Goodbye, darling.
- Excuse me.
Thanks. This'll make an interesting story.
- Who opened the door?
- No one.
- It opens automatically.
- How do you mean?
Well, you see that plate?
You just drive over that, the door opens.
I never saw anything like that.
Mind if I try it?
No. Go ahead. Just drive straight back.
Now just drive it forward.
Ohhh!
- What's it say?
- "Out of order."
- Where'd you get that?
- I found it on there.
The fella put it on there when you were...
We'll have to walk up.
- What floor do you live on?
- The 13th.
- Gee, that's quite a way.
- We'll be up there in a jiffy.
What's 13 flights?
Going up?
- Five.
- That's right. Won't be long now.
- Six.
- Mm.
- How long did you say it would take?
- Just a jiffy.
- How far's a jiffy?
- About three shakes of a dead lamb's tail.
Didn't think it was so far.
Surprising the distance...
- Seven.
- Uh-huh.
- How many with seven makes 13?
- Six.
Swell. We've only got six more jiffies.
Won't be long now.
- Eight.
- Nine.
I think we'd better rest a while.
That was a good idea of yours.
Come, come. Don't block the stairway.
Who do you think you're talking to?!
You, you big overstuffed polliwog!
- You smile when you call me that!
- Ha!
If we weren't in this apartment house,
I'd wipe the floor with you!
- Don't let that stop you.
- Take him outside.
- Outside?
- See? He's afraid to go.
Who's afraid to go? Any time you're ready!
Well, there's no time like the present!
- I should say not.
- Come on!
You can't get away with that with me.
Polliwog, huh?
He can't talk to you like that.
There's going to be a fight.
There's gonna be a fight.
Hey, Ollie? What's a polliwog?
- I'll tell you later.
- There's gonna be a fight.
There's gonna be a fight.
There's gonna be a fight.
You think you can get away with that?
There's gonna be a fight.
I'd better help you.
Never mind. Just leave it to me.
It'll be over in a jiffy.
Hey. There's gonna be a fight.
We'll show him!
- If you apologise, it's all right with me.
- Apologise?! Ha! For what?
For calling me an overstuffed polliwog!
No man can call me an overstuffed polliwog and get away with it!
All right.
You're not an overstuffed polliwog.
- That's better.
- You're an inflated blimp!
That's different.
I don't know what that means, but these people can't be wrong.
- Then fight and shut up.
- You bet your life I'll fight.
The very idea!
He wants to fight! Come outside.
I'm gonna give you one more chance to apologise.
Oh, all right. I'm sorry. I apologise.
I knew he was yellow!
Yellow, eh?!
Get back there and fight!
- You'd better call an ambulance.
- Yes, sir.
There's gonna be a fight. You'd better come.
- What happened?
- The fight is over.
- What did you do to him?
- Never mind.
Why did you suggest coming down here when we could have done the same thing on the tenth floor?
- I didn't know he was gonna...
- (Woman) Ollie!
Lulu! Gee, I haven't seen you in ages.
- You remember Stan?
- How could I forget him?
I met him today.
I haven't seen him in 20 years.
Everybody thought I was dead, didn't they?
- How did you find out you weren't?
- Well, I figured that...
- I saw my picture in the paper.
- Yeah.
- What ya doing?
- Taking Stan to meet the missus.
The missus? Are you married?
I sure am. To the finest woman in the world.
And how she can cook.
- Ollie, did you get my note?
- What note?
I just sent a note up and I wouldn't want anybody but you to read it.
- What was in it?
- I was just... reminiscing.
Ohhh! We gotta get that note!
- Ollie. When you get it, burn it.
- I will, don't worry!
- Hey, what ya do that for?
- Don't bother me!
Pop! Come out here!
That fat guy kicked my ball down the stairs.
- Hey, you. Come here.
- Is there gonna be a fight?
Shh!
- Go downstairs and get that ball.
- I'm busy...
- Get going!
- Yes, sir.
- Go and get the ball for me.
- Why should I go down and get it?
I've got to get the note.
It's a matter of life and death.
- (Whimpering) I don't want to!
- Don't argue with me. And hurry up!
- Where's that ball?
- My friend's...
- I told you to get it!
- I know but...
Go on down and get that ball!
I'll wait till you bring it back.
If he thinks I'm gonna run downstairs, he's crazy.
Give it to the kid and don't let it happen again.
Hey, Pop! That guy kicked me!
Why don't you put some ice in it?
Come on.
- Why didn't you tell me you had the key?
- You didn't ask me.
"Didn't ask me"!
- Gee, that's pretty underwear.
- Don't get personal.
- Mr Hardy?
- Ohh!
Yes, Mrs Gilbert?
- This note was left here by mistake.
- Thank you.
- Who's it from?
- It's from Lulu... No, it isn't.
- How do I know who it's from?
- This is my friend Mr Laurel, Mrs Gilbert.
- How do you do?
- Mrs Gilbert is my neighbour.
- He's going to stay with us.
- Oh, how nice.
- How's Mrs Hardy?
- She's still just as sweet as ever.
I was telling him how well she cooks.
Yes. I hear she's one of the best.
I hope you have a pleasant stay.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Come in here.
Yoo-hoo! Oh, honey?
Oh, darling!
Oh, baby?
She's gone shopping.
Sit down and make yourself at home.
You've got a swell place here.
Well, it's comfy.
- Have you got a cigarette?
- I never smoke.
Would your wife mind if I smoke my pipe?
Of course not.
What's all right with me is OK with her.
But a lot of dames are particular.
But she's not... What do you mean, calling my wife a dame?
Hello, honey.
So you were going to be back in an hour?
- Is that the wife?
- Yeah.
- You said she was the...
- She's only clowning. Come and meet her.
She's the greatest kidder in the world. Darling?
Sugar, I want you to meet my buddy.
How often have I told you not to bring your tramp friends here?
But I haven't seen Stan in 20 years.
I couldn't see him in a hundred years.
This is no time for levity. I've been telling him how wonderful you could cook.
- Oh, you have?
- How about a thick, juicy steak?
- Who put that bee in your bonnet?
- He did, didn't you?
If you think
I'm going to stand over a hot stove and cook for every knick-knack, you're crazy.
Excuse me.
But, toots, Stanley's different.
I'll say he's different.
And don't call me toots!
- What's a knick-knack?
- A thing that sits on top of a whatnot.
And don't bother me!
Will you shut up?!
If you knew this boy, you'd appreciate him.
I went to the Soldier's Home to get him to have a nice big, juicy steak.
Come outta there!
And put that pipe out.
Will you get out of my way? I'd like somebody to cook for me for a change.
I'm not gonna stay here the rest of my life slaving over a hot stove for you and your good-for-nothing buddies. Goodbye!
Goodbye.
- Let that be a lesson to you.
- What?
Never get married.
Well, thanks for the lovely time.
I'll be seeing you later.
- Where are you going?
- The Soldier's Home.
- What for?
- To eat.
You'll have something to eat if I have to cook it myself.
You go and light the oven and I'll set the table.
- We'll show her.
- I'll say we'll show her.
Ha! Ha! You can't do that to me!
Ha!
Ollie?
- What?
- You got a match?
- What for?
- I want to light the oven.
Go and sit down.
You get on my nerves. I'll light it.
Any time I want something done right,
I always have to do it myself.
- (Explosion)
- Ohhh!
Mr Hardy, what in the world happened?
We had a slight accident.
I was planning to cook dinner for Mr Laurel and...
- Where's Mrs Hardy?
- Luckily, she went out.
What would she think if she saw this?
- I shudder to think.
- Let me help you clean it up.
That's awfully sweet of you.
- Where have you been?
- I thought there was an earthquake.
Turn the gas off and get me some punch.
I'm a nervous wreck.
And get one for Mrs Gilbert.
Never mind. I'll do it myself.
That's right. Whenever you want anything done right, always do it yourself.
- Pardon us.
- Certainly.
We'll have this place cleaned up in a jiffy.
- (Hissing)
- Turn that gas off.
Get me some glasses.
Ohh!
Gee, I'm awfully sorry, Mrs Gilbert.
That's quite all right.
Accidents will happen.
- I'll get you something.
- No, don't bother.
I'll go to the apartment.
It won't take a minute to change.
- I'll be right back.
- That's awfully kind of you.
What happened?
"What happened"! Oh!
Something wrong?
I left my key in the apartment. What'll I do?
Maybe Mrs Hardy left something you can slip on.
Here, Mrs Gilbert. This is all I could find.
Take off that wet dress before you catch cold.
I'll phone downstairs and have them send you up a key.
- Thank you, Mr Hardy.
- You're welcome. Thank you.
Hello?
Hello? Hello?
- Hello?
- Hello.
- This is Mr Hardy. How are you?
- Fine.
- Good.
- Nice weather we're having.
It's a beautiful day.
Mrs Gilbert is locked out of her apartment.
- Will you send up a key?
- What's the number?
Just a minute.
Why should I send up a key?
If she came in here and...
Mrs Gilbert, the phone is out of order.
I'll have to go downstairs.
- Would you do that?
- Yes. I'll be back in just a jiffy.
Don't take too long.
- Mrs Hardy is coming.
- That's all right. I can explain.
Not in my pyjamas you can't.
You don't know my wife.
- What are we going to do?
- We've got to hide.
- I'll find a place over here.
- You come with me.
- There's no place in here to hide.
- We must find a place. My wife'll kill me!
- Sit like a chair.
- What?
Sit like a chair, like that.
And don't make a noise.
Hold still.
Come on, quick. We can hide in here.
- What happened here?
- I don't know. We started to cook...
- Where's that big, fat billycan of mine?
- He's hiding.
- Where?
- In there.
Oh, he is, is he?
Well, he won't be hiding long.
"...see my grandfather.
The grandfather laughed. He said..."
- Hello, sugar.
- Don't sugar me!
How come my car's all smashed?
- Well, dear...
- Sit down!
I come back after five minutes and find the place wrecked!
- If you let me...
- Sit down!
Have you been playing soldier?
I try to keep things nice for you and I come back and find things wrecked!
Sit down, I tell you!
If you think I'm going home to Mother, you're crazy.
Silly to go on arguing like...
I wouldn't argue.
After all, it's no good to argue.
Just because I came up here.
I had nothing to do with it.
Silly to go on arguing like that.
What are you arguing about?
If you want me to go,
I'll stay as long as you want.
Silliest thing I ever heard.
And I gave you a dollar and 25 cents!
Silliest thing I ever heard.
I wish you'd stop this argument.
It's the silliest thing I ever...
I never heard anything like it in my life.
- Isn't that terrible?
- Get up from there.
Oh, my beautiful stove!
What did you do with the kitchen?
It's wrecked!
- And another thing!
- Sit down!
- Get up!
- Sit down!
- Get up!
- Sit down!
- Get up!
- Sit down! I'm the boss here!
- Sit down!
- Get up!
- Oh! I'm fed up!
- Sit down! Get up!
Get up out of there! Stand up!
- She said I could.
- I don't care!
If I want to sit down, I'll sit down.
I can do just as I like cos she told me that I could sit...
Big dumbbell!
In the trunk. Quick. Get in here quick!
- Let me tell you something.
- Let me tell you something...
- Sit down! You listen to me...
- Shush!
- I've had enough of this.
- How dare you?
Tut tut tut tut!
I'm going to leave for a change!
And I am not going home to Mother.
Pardon us.
Come, Stanley.
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Ha!
Just a minute!
Where do you think you're going?
I've packed and I'm leaving for Honolulu!
You are? Who put that bee in your bonnet?
Stan said I should get out of here.
Besides, the trip will do me good.
Oh, you did?
So not content with wrecking my home, you wanna take my husband away?
I'll fix you!
- Is there gonna be a fight?
- Shh!
- Wait a minute!
- Let me tell you something...
What's the matter?
(Mrs Hardy) I'll tell you what's the matter.
That little worm is trying to break up my happy home!
But I'll have the police take him back to the Old Soldier's Home where he belongs!
So you're a home breaker, huh?
You look like the kind of a guy that would break up a happy home.
You know what I would do to anybody that comes between me and my wife?
I'd get my trusty fowling piece and I'd blow him... to nothing!
I had nothing to do with it.
He brought me here.
- He was gonna give me a nice steak...
- What happened?
He's got a girl in the trunk and he didn't want his wife to know.
- What did you tell him that for?
- He asked me.
When the wife's away, the rats will play!
Why bring them into your own home?
That's ridiculous.
Come with me sometime.
I know where there's a whole bunch.
Listen. Why do you think
I go to Borneo all the time?
You can come with me sometime.
You too. How do you do? I was gonna...
My wife!
I kill him!
I can't miss all the time!
Wilt thou, Magdelana Borst...
take this man to thy wedded husband...
to love, comfort, honor and obey him, and forsaking all others... keep thee only unto him so long as ye both shall live?
I will.
Oh!
Wilt thou, Gilbert Martin, take this woman to thy wedded wife... to love, comfort and honor her... and forsaking all others, keep thee only unto her so long as ye both shall live?
- I will.
- Let us pray.
O Almighty God, look down upon and bless these two young people... as they go forth this day into the wilderness...
to make for themselves a new home.
Guide them,
Gracious Father... protect and keep them through all the trials and vicissitudes of life... that they may never cease to remember this hour... and this pledge of love which they have given, one to the other...
in thy sacred sight.
Amen.
And now, in the name of the Father... and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost,
I pronounce you man and wife.
What God hath joined together...
let not man put asunder.
Kiss her, my son.
- Lana! Lana, throw it!
- Good-bye.
- God bless you, Gilbert.
- Good-bye, sir.
- Good-bye, son.
Good-bye, Mrs. -
Mother.
- Take good care of her.
Wait till she sees this.
Good-bye. Good-bye.
- That sure was a nice weddin'.
- Wasn't it?
- The cow hitched easy?
- Cow?
- Giddyap.
- Mother, good-bye.
Bye.
- Good-bye.
- Oh, no, my friends.
It's always been like this since Bible days.
Every generation must make its own way in one place or another.
- It's the most beautiful country I've ever seen.
- I told you so.
The Mohawk Valley is the prettiest place in the whole country, for a fact.
Susie.
Gin.
Have one. Just especial, seeing it's tonight.
- You folks come far?
- Yes. Albany.
- Where?
- Albany!
- Albany.
- Yes.
Been married long?
Oh, not so long.
How long?
Not so long!
I- I thought that's what you said.
I knew it the minute
I laid eyes on ya.
Honeymooners.
You got it written all over both of you.
Honeymooners!
To your health, madam, sir.
You planning on settling here in the valley?
Yes. I have a place at Deerfield.
Deerfield? That's pretty far out of the way, isn't it?
Yes, but it suits me.
What political party do you folks up that way belong to?
The American.
Any Tories?
Not that I know of. Why?
Oh, nothing.
I was just wondering.
They say the Indians are going to line up with the British, but I suppose that's just talk.
Well, good night.
That's a queer one, ain't he?
Too many questions to suit me.
And that patch over his eye-
I bet he lost it trying to see something that wasn't none of his business.
Good night.
Good night now.
Good night.
You didn't get scared, did you, at what that fella just said... about the Tories and the Indians?
I wasn't even thinking about Indians.
What were you thinking about?
I was just wondering... if you love me as much as I love you.
Are there always flies like this?
In the real woods there are.
It must be gonna rain, though, the way these take hold.
You'll get used to 'em up here, though.
Lana, we're home now! Look!
I'll get a fire going.
It's just a cabin, but-
Well, I've always thought it would be nice living in a cabin.
It's so handy to look after things when it's small.
It seemed so fine to me because I built it.
I didn't realize it might look different to a girl... who'd been raised in a big house like yours.
Oh, it's all right, Gil.
Beginning this way... we'll like our things even better when we get them.
Oh, Lana.
Just wait till I put up the mare and we get something to eat and feel warmer. We'll-
Things will look different then.
You'd better take those wet things off, Lana.
You'll be sick.
No! Gil! Gil!
Gil! Gil!
Oh, Gil! Gil!
Gil! Gil!
- Get him! Do something!
- Why, Lana, that's only Blue Back.
- He'll murder us! He'll murder us!
- Lana, stop that!
Gil-
I'm sorry, Lana.
I had to do it.
You've gotta get a hold of yourself.
This is my wife, Blue Back.
She's kind of nervous and tired out.
We had a long, hard trip in the rain and everything.
Sure. Much rain.
I guess she didn't expect anybody to drop in at a time like this.
Me go hunting.
Bring you half deer. Hang outside.
Half deer, huh? Well, that's mighty fine of you, Blue Back. Thanks.
Sit down. I got some rum outside.
We'll have a drink together.
No. Me go now.
Come back again, maybe.
Sure, any time.
- You're a good friend, Blue Back.
- Sure, fine friends.
Good Christian!
Hallelujah!
Lana.
- I'm going home.
- Home?
I can't stand it!
Mother was right.
I'm no frontier woman.
I had no idea it was like this.
I hate it!
- Lana, what are you saying?
- You had no right to bring me here!
It- It's awful! And that horrible man- that Indian slipping in here.
Now you're acting crazy again.
Blue Back wouldn't hurt you.
- Why, he's as good a Christian as you or me, maybe better.
- I don't care!
- I'm going home. I'm going now! Gil!
- No, you're not.
You're gonna stay right here and do as I say from now on.
You're gonna get over this foolishness and stop being scared. Do you understand?
Lana, I didn't wanna hit you.
I had to do it.
Lana, look at me.
I love you.
I need you.
I can't live without you now.
You know that.
Yes.
Look, here's Blue Back again, see?
You got a fine woman.
But you young man.
You use this on her.
Lick her good!
Make fine woman.
What are you thinking about now?
Gil.
What are you thinking about?
Oh, I was just thinking about what this place is gonna look like couple years from now.
Next summer we can start building a barn, right on that slope over there.
A hillside barn, just like I've always wanted.
Then after that, we can start thinking about building a decent house.
I like our house just as it is now.
Oh, sure. But I always remember how you ladies hanker after frame houses.
Well, I suppose the place will look so beautiful you won't care what your wife looks like.
I can get blisters all over my hands, and my nose peeled... and that's the thanks
I get for it.
Let's see some of those blisters you're talking so big about.
No! No, never mind! Leave me alone.
Let it go.
Why, Lana, your hand is sore.
- Maybe you oughtn't come out here like this.
- I want to.
I know, but haying's hard work.
It's about the hardest work there is.
It's... no job for a woman.
Oh, now, there you go.
Just because a woman is raised in a town, she has to be frail.
I'm not. I'm strong. You said yourself you couldn't have done without me.
- I sure married myself some good hired help.
- No, no! Now stop.
Stop it yourself.
Do you like me as much as you do your old farm?
- Good morning, ladies.
- Hello, Gil.
- Hello.
- Good morning, Gil.
- Hello, Gil! Good morning, Lana!
- Good morning.
Joe.
Mighty pretty.
- Oh, General Herkimer.
- Hello, Martin.
This is my wife, Lana.
Ja. Ja. Hübsch.
She's as pretty as the near side of a peach.
Maybe prettier.
- Reall.
- And, Lana, this is Mrs. Weaver and her husband.
I'm your nearest neighbor.
I've been meaning to call... me and George and John here, my boy.
- How do?
- I'm so glad to meet you.
And this is Christian's wife, Mrs. Reall, and her daughter Martha Ellen.
- How do you do?
- Howdy. And this is my oldest girl, Mary.
- Hello, Mary.
- Hello, Mrs. Martin.
- And Mrs. Demooth.
- My husband is the captain.
How do you do?
- Oh, how do you do?
- And Dr. Petry.
How do, Mrs. Martin?
Oh, pass the lot of 'em.
Um-
Fall in! Outside.
All right, men.
Hup! Hup!
Hup! Hup! Hup!
Hup! Hup!
Hup! Hup!
Don't be afraid of these women, Mrs. Martin.
You'll find they're good neighbors... once they get over being mad at you for being so pretty.
- Oh, don't be so silly.
- That bonnet you got on is giving them a lot of worry.
And they're dying to shoo us men off... so they can find out if you and Gil have got a family on the way.
- Oh, Nicholas Herkimer!
- We weren't gonna tell anybody.
- Lana!
Oh, that's just fine.
- Congratulations, Martin.
- Thank you.
That's just fine. A baby.
You know, I don't believe in young folks waiting.
- I always say a man needs help on his place...
- Stick out your tongue.
And the only way to get it is to have children, especially boys.
- Why, Maggie Weaver, how awful.
Militia, fall in!
- Fall in what?
Attention.
Dress to the right.
- That's my husband.
Call the roll.
- Amos Brock.
- Here.
- John Weaver?
- Here!
- George Weaver.
- Here.
- Gilbert Martin.
- Here.
Christian Reall.
Christian Reall!
Christian-
That's me. Here.
- Adam Hartman.
- Here.
- James McNod.
James McNod!
He couldn't come today.
He had to go and buy flour.
Then I've got to fine him.
That's the law.
It don't look to me as though you had any right to fine a man for not coming if he can't!
I thought that's what this war was about- making people pay taxes when they didn't have no say-so about it.
That's right. That's what
I'm carrying Long Tom for.
Ain't up to me.
Talk to the general.
Oh, I guess we can let that go this time.
And that's enough of the roll call too.
You can check up later.
Stand at ease, men.
Neighbors... ever since New York and the 12 colonies signed the Declaration of Independence... this revolution has turned into a real war.
So far we've been lucky up here in the Mohawk...
but it looks like we are going to be dragged into it too.
Sure as shootin'.
That's why I got you here- to get ready, no matter what happens.
I guess we all feel the same way about it.
This is our home and our land.
And I say it's worth fighting for... only we got to do it by ourselves.
Congress can't help us.
They say Washington needs all the troops he can get... and that the frontier will have to look out for itself.
Maybe them regular soldiers don't like the kind of liquor we drink up here, huh, General?
Adam!
Maybe not, but that's what they say.
Now, about the Indians, from all I hear... the Tories are making them a lot of big promises.
We got our agents working too, but there's no telling which way they'll jump.
Oh, I don't think we'll have any trouble with the Indians.
- We've always treated them fair.
- That's right.
Maybe so, but just the same... if you hear the bell ringing at the fort or the cannon go off... you drop everything and come running.
Do you understand?
All of you, come running.
Else I have you flogged so fast you won't know what.
Now, come on. Show the women how good you can drill.
- Take them around the field, Captain.
- Attention!
Nice talk, Nicholas.
Carry arms!
Forward left, march!
All right!
By thunder, I'll bet we can lick the whole world the way we march.
Ezra, help us over here!
Coming right along with you, Gil.
Put it right on top.
Look out now.
Come on! Come on!
Now she's going good.
- How is the core- pretty rotten, Adam?
- Yeah.
- Try to fall it right down in there.
- All right.
Keep working on the edge. That's the idea.
This'll make a nice patch for wheat, Gil.
You got good soil here.
I figure the loam's close to four feet.
Yes, sir, I bet there isn't any better soil in the whole valley.
You're just a natural-born farmer, ain't ya?
So you'd be, if you'd marry and settle down.
There she goes!
There she goes.
That's gonna be good firewood.
There it goes.
Start heaving, Cleave.
- Push her in, Gil.
- Push her in there.
Yeah, get on out!
- Make it straightaway.
- Heave!
Heave! Heave!
Come on! Come on.
You certainly brought a lot of pretty things with you, Mrs. Martin.
- Heavenly.
- I told Mother there was no sense in bringing... a lot of clothes and such things.
I'd rather have the money spent on furniture.
- I see you've got one of these feathers.
- Yes.
Mother had five of them at home.
She said there are times in a woman's life... when something like that is more important than bread.
- What in the world is it?
- A pheasant's feather.
Looks like it came out of an angel's wing.
We had a lot of them at home, but they collected so much dust, we threw them out.
Yes.
This is a nice teapot.
What is it, Wedgwood?
I don't know.
It's just white china, I guess.
- It belonged to my grandmother.
- We always ate off Wedgwood at home.
- Eat?
- Come on out! They've started burning already.
- Great burning. Started it myself.
- Come on.
Let's go see the burning.
Come on.
Throw it on there.
Gil, it's going to be beautiful.
It's Blue Back!
Indians on the warpath.
Coming.
Eight white men...
100 Indians.
Painted. Better hurry.
- Johnny Weaver, get your horse and tell General Herkimer.
Stop it! Stop it!
- Gil!
- Take this, Gil.
- Thanks, Joe. Adam, watch out for Lana, will you?
- Come on, Lana.
- No.
- You go too. Senecas, they kill.
I can't leave my place, the crops.
Gil, you've got to. You've got to come.
I won't leave without you.
All right, I'll get the cart.
Indians. I know. Get.
Two, three, four-
Two, three- One-
Four, five, six-
Come on, Christian.
They're all here. Get in your wagon.
- Here!
- Thanks.
Gil, the cow, aren't we going to take her?
We can't take her.
She'll just slow us up.
Oh, Gil, I can't stand it.
It's like leaving part of ourselves.
Don't look back. Giddyap!
- Come on, Mary.
- Hurry up, Gil!
Come on, Gil!
- Mr. Martin!
- Whoa!
Come on, Mary!
- Wait a minute.
- Where's the rest of your family?
- I don't know. I lost them.
- Give her to me.
Come on. Hurry up!
- All right.
- Giddyap, Susie!
Get!
We got Mary and Martha with us.
Get 'em in, Christian.
Climb right in the wagon here.
Come on, Trudy. You help Mary.
- Trudy, where's Nancy?
- Here she is.
- Where's Martha?
- Here's Martha.
- We're gonna have to throw some of this furniture out.
- Oh, no, Gil!
We've got to.
- We're ready, Gil.
- I told you not to look back.
Keep up there. Keep up there.
- Come on. Pull ahead there.
Mr. Martin!
- You got her?
- Yeah.
Gil! Gil, what's happened?
Oh! Mary Johnson!
- Come on! Come on!
- She was driving, and all of a sudden she fainted.
Never mind. There.
Put her down.
- Get up and get out of here!
- I won't! My husband's the captain.
- Get out before I use a strap on you.
- No!
Get some hot water, and tell that fool doctor to hurry.
- I don't understand. It's not like Lana.
- Never mind. She'll be all right.
- What in thunder's the matter here?
- Oh, Doctor.
- More sniveling women.
- It's my wife. She fainted.
I can't say I blame her, all this racket.
Gil. Gil Martin.
They're waiting for you, Gil.
The company's ready to go.
- What is it, Doctor?
- Nothing you can do anything about.
Go on. Get out of here.
- How is she, Gil?
- I don't know.
- Everything ready, Demooth?
- Yes, sir.
Drummer boy, play the drum.
Men, follow me!
Adam, did you see them?
Did you catch them?
No. We chased them seven, eight miles, but they got away from us.
- What happened?
- The excitement and all that jolting was too much for her.
Oh, but don't fret too much.
You're both young.
You'll have another baby.
Oh, she's all right now.
Just tired.
But don't let her talk too much.
Lana?
Gil.
Oh, Lana, darling.
Gil, our house?
They burned it.
- The crops?
- Everything. I saw it coming back.
Oh, and now-
Please don't, Lana.
- I failed you, Gil.
- No.
No, Lana, it wasn't your fault. It-
It just happens that way sometimes.
My poor Gil.
Oh, Lana.
You're all right.
That's all I care about.
It doesn't seem possible people can work as hard as we did, Lana... for nothin'.
We can build it back again, Gil.
We still have the land.
You think I'd let you come back out here and go through that sort of thing again?
No, you were right that first night.
You should have gone home then.
I was a fool not to see it.
- Gil.
- I never should have brought you out here in the first place.
This is no place for you.
It's no place for any woman.
I'm not the only woman who's gone through this, Gil.
What'll we do?
How will we live?
Well, Adam says that Mrs. McKlennar's hired man ran off... and she's looking for a couple to work her place.
But, Lana, why, you can't hire out!
A girl like you?
Do you think I'd-
It wouldn't have to be for long.
Just until we made enough to come back here and start.
Lana, you can't do it!
Oh, Gil, it won't do any harm just to talk it over with her.
No! Hired help.
No.
Mrs. McKlennar.
Good morning.
- Your name Martin?
- Yes, ma'am.
Well, go on and stare.
I know how I look.
When that fool hired man of mine got drunk and ran off... he left me with everything to do.
Martin, I don't mind a man having his liquor, so long as he knows how to hold it.
When it fixes him so's he can't do his work... then he'd better go someplace else, and the quicker the better.
Well, don't stand there with your mouths open.
Sit down. Sit down. Sit down.
Now you're here on business, so let's get down to it. You know how to farm?
- I had my own place.
- Yes, I heard it was burned.
Well, that's too bad, but that's neither here nor there.
Daisy! Get my dinner ready.
I'm hungry enough to eat a horse.
I don't do much farming here.
Just take care of the meadow and feed my stock.
But you can do what you like.
I'm a widow.
My husband was
Captain Barnabas McKlennar.
Barney.
Barney.
What was I saying?
Oh. I was brought up on army life... so when I give an order,
I expect to get it obeyed.
- What?
- If I take your pay, I'll do the best I can.
Well, I just don't want you coming around afterwards complaining. That's all.
How much do you want?
I never worked for anybody else.
What'd you expect to pay?
Forty-five pounds a year- your house, the wood and food.
If your wife can sew, I'll pay her too.
Can you sew, you, what's your name?
- Lana.
- Well, can you sew?
- Yes.
- Speak up! Speak up! You want to sew for me?
- Yes, I'd like to.
- Well, let me see your hands.
Let me see your hands.
Hmm.
That's settled.
I hate sewing myself.
Hate any housework.
So I do the barn and let Daisy do the cooking.
I took good care of my husband.
Now he's gone, I do as I like.
I've got a long face and I poke it where I please.
- You may think I'm a nuisance.
- Yes, ma'am.
What? A nuis-
What? What'd he say?
I didn't mean it.
But I guess if you do poke, I'll think so.
Ah.
Well, your thoughts are your own property,
Martin, but keep 'em to yourself.
Come on. I suppose you want to see your new home.
I'll expect you to use the back door if you want to ask me for anything.
I don't want mud tracked through my house.
I track enough myself.
A mess now.
After that man.
- But it's a good house.
- It sure is, ma'am.
Nice chimney, nice bedroom upstairs.
I used to live here myself... till Barnabas took it into his head to build that stone place.
It's a beautiful house.
Glad you got sense enough to see it.
Now there's one more thing
I want to ask you. Got any furniture?
We have a bed and a few things.
Well, I'll help you out with the rest.
You can consider the job yours, Martin.
Now, any questions you want to ask?
Yes, ma'am.
It's- I just-
- Well, what? What?
- Well, do you belong to the right party?
Right party!
Martin, a woman hasn't got any political opinions.
I run this farm to suit myself.
I'll shoot the daylights out of anybody-
British, Indian or American- that thinks he can come around here monkeying in my business.
- Does that satisfy you?
- Yes, ma'am.
- Well, when can you move in?
- Well, will tomorrow be too soon?
To-Tomorrow?
What's the matter with today?
- Oh, we'll move in today!
- Good. Good.
- Oh, Lana.
- Oh, Gil!
Oh, Gil. Oh!
Oh, Gil, it- it's a beautiful fireplace.
Hear me, O Lord
And that anon
To help me
Make good speed
Be thou my rock
And house of stone
My fence in time
Of need
Amen
O Almighty God... hear us, we beseech thee... and bring succor and guidance... to those we are about to bring to thy divine notice.
First, we are thinking of Mary Wollaber.
She is just 16 years old... but she is keeping company with a soldier from Fort Dayton.
He's a Massachusetts man,
O Lord... and thou knowest no good can come of that.
Hallelujah!
Now we are thinking of the sick and infirm.
Peter Paris has the flux real bad.
His Uncle Isaacs, who keeps the store in Dayton... asks for our prayers.
And he says that he has just got in a new supply... of calicos,
French broadcloths...
- fancy handkerchiefs, new hats and heavy boots...
- Shh.
All at bargain prices.
But most of all... we call upon thee, Lord Jehovah...
O God of battles... to aid thy people against the Tories... for I have disturbing news for you that will sorrow this Sabbath.
General Washington has advised us... that an enemy army of many Tories and savage Indians... is even now on its way to our beloved valley.
Every man capable of bearing arms... between the ages of 16 and 60...
will report tomorrow morning to General Herkimer...
at which time, a regiment... of Washington's continental army... will arrive from Albany... under the command of Colonel Fischer to help us.
Any man failing to report for duty will be promptly hanged.
Amen.
You stick close to Mrs. McKlennar,
Lana, and do what she says.
Yes, Gil.
Well, I'd better go now.
Watch out for those new apple trees.
Gil.
Thank you, ma'am.
It used to be Barney's, but it's no use to me now.
Might come in handy to you.
Gil Martin, I'm gonna kiss ya, so I better do it now... so's you won't go off with the taste of a widow on your mouth.
Many's the time
I've seen Barney go off... just that same way.
Good-bye. He's off.
Sometimes he'd wave.
Ten-to-one he wasn't even seeing me.
He was thinking about all those men, you see- all those men going out to fight- to kill or be killed.
Blast his eyes, loving it.
So they sent you all the way over here to tell us to come inside the fort, did they?
It's orders. Where women and children shall be gathered together, it says.
Me and other men over 60 are to collect and protect 'em.
You old rooster.
Don't you think I can look after myself?
Yes, ma'am.
But it's orders.
I been saving a corner shed for you.
Shed! Do I look like the kind of a woman... that would start living in a shed at my time of life, like a cow?
- Yes, ma'am.
- What?
- No, ma'am.
- Go on, spit, man. Spit and get it over with.
Hey! Not there! Outside! Go on.
Get on out of here. Go on.
The old fool.
He can't even spit by himself.
Waiting, waiting.
That's all we women do, is wait.
Well, no news is good news.
Why don't you sit down, Lana?
Mosquitoes!
Mrs. McKlennar! Lana!
Here they come!
Come on out!
Here they come!
Where's John?
Have you seen Gil Martin?
Gil.
Take them inside. Go in. Anyone else, go in.
Have you seen Gil Martin?
I'm Robert Johnson, ma'am. Surgeon pro tem of the 1st Regiment, New York line.
Then don't stand there yapping about it.
Go on in and see the general.
Yes, ma'am.
Mark, where's Gil?
Gil Martin?
Gil! Gil!
Gil!
Gil-
I'm Captain Morgan, ma'am.
There's nobody back of me alive.
No.
Well, General Herkimer, a fine mess you've got yourself into this time.
I tell this fellow to go away.
Look after the young ones.
Shut up! You're not giving orders in this house.
What about it?
It's- It's already mortified, ma'am.
I- It'll have to come off.
- Ja, bitte?
- Ja, Nicholas.
- Wait till I light my pipe.
- Yes.
Look out. John!
Tell me something first, Doctor.
Did you ever cut off a leg before?
Why-Why, no, sir. I-
Well, don't be ashamed.
A man has gotta start somewhere.
I'll never forget the first deer I shot.
Gil?
Gil?
- Lana? Lana.
Gil! Gil.
Oh, thank God! Gil.
It's so cold.
Colder here than the woods.
Yeah.
Raining-
Lying there-
I remember thinking how hot it was... wondering-
- I'm cold.
- Yes, dear.
Wondering how long we'd be away... when it happened.
- I heard a crackling...
- Daisy. Daisy, some water.
Like a stick breaking... and all of sudden, the fella next to me stopped talking... and fell over on his side.
Then I heard a whistle.
Shots from everywhere.
Somebody shouted we'd been ambushed.
- I saw General Herkimer slide off his horse...
- Oh.
And grab his knee.
Peter Ten Eyck with his head blown half-off.
Oh, darling, this is going to hurt.
- Somebody told me to lay down...
And then I saw 'em... all smeared with paint- yellow and red- every color.
Oh, darling, I'm sorry.
In back of 'em,
Tories with green coats.
I got down back of a log and aimed at a fella.
He leaped straight up in the air.
- Darling, don't talk about it.
- He fell forward on his face.
- After that we...
Just kept shootin' as fast as we could load... for I don't know how long.
Amos-
Adam Hartman came over beside me.
His musket was broke.
But he had a spear.
He kept grinnin'.
I remember thinkin'...
"He's havin' a good time.
He likes this."
Pretty soon he pointed off.
- I saw an Indian comin' towards us, naked.
- Darling, don't talk.
I tried to load, but it was too late.
Adam stood up and braced his spear... and the Indian came down.
I never saw a fella look so funny, so surprised.
He just... hung there... with his mouth open... lookin' at us and not sayin' a word.
- I had to shoot him.
There wasn't anything else to do.
- Oh.
- I had to!
- Yes, dear.
- Brandy, Nicholas?
- Ja, ja.
Swallow. Swallow.
- Now, Nicholas?
Go ahead.
Then it started to rain... and I was sick.
All the time General Herkimer just sat there smoking his pipe and holding his knee.
Then he said we'd all better go home.
Oh, darling, don't talk about it.
Out of 600 of us... about 240 were still alive... but we'd won.
- We licked 'em.
- Yes, darling.
- We showed 'em they couldn't take this valley.
- Yes, darling.
- Lana?
- Yes, dear.
Do you hear? We'd won.
Yes, darling. You won.
Now you've got to sleep, Gil. You-
Adam. Adam, help me get him down.
- Get that pack there.
- Uh-huh. Yes.
- Here.
Sleep, darling.
You sleep.
Lana?
- Lana?
Oh, Gil. Gil.
I feel as if I've been asleep forever.
You needed it.
I've been lyin' here lookin' at you... thinkin' how pretty you are.
Oh, darling.
Made me think of the first days we had together at Deerfield.
I've been thinking about that too- the things we'd planned.
While I was out there...
I kept thinking about you all the time- about how good it'll be when everything's over and we can go back home.
Gil, the Indians-
They won't be coming back this way again, will they?
Oh, I don't reckon they'd have the nerve after the lickin' we gave 'em.
Why?
We're going to have another baby.
Are you glad, Lana?
I feel as-
I feel as though
I'd just begun to live all over again.
Are you hungry?
Doctor, how is General Herkimer?
General Herkimer is dead.
We couldn't stop the bleeding.
"'I am the resurrection, and the life, 'saith the Lord.
- "He that believeth in me...
"though he were dead,
:
And whosoever liveth and believeth-"
"I know my redeemer liveth...
"and that he shall stand at the latter :
"And though after my skin worms destroy this body...
yet in my flesh
I shall see God. "
Come on, Gil.
Don't stop now.
You know what Doc Petry said about havin' plenty of hot water on hand.
I know, but the water's boiled away twice already, and nothing's happened yet.
I don't know why we gotta have so much hot water when babies are born anyhow.
Mr. Martin! Mr. Martin!
Miss McKlennar wants you at once!
Gil! Gil.
One of Barney's soldiers made this cradle.
Give it to me the night we were married.
Your Lana might as well have it.
- Hmm?
- That's mighty kind of you, ma'am.
Oh, nonsense!
What good is it to me?
Can't ever tell. A good lookin' widow like you.
Ah, shut up.
You make me sick.
- Great big good-for-nothing loudmouthed fool!
- Even if you are good lookin'! Ooh!
- Stop!
- Get out of my way!
- Ooh.
- Oh!
Oh! Poor Gil.
- Not yet, boys. Not yet.
- Huh?
- No.
It's the waiting around that-
Not knowing what's going on.
Why can't Dr. Petry do somethin'?
Why can't he?
I don't know, Gil.
Blue Back, you've had a lot of experience in this business. What do you think?
Having babies, that's woman's business.
She better go far, far by herself.
Leave husband alone!
Daisy!
Daisy, hurry with those things.
This is terrible.
Gil! Gil Martin!
Get some hot water, quick!
- That's all right. That's all right.
George Weaver, you keep away from that springhouse.
Uh, I'll get some-
I'll get some more wood.
It's a boy.
Praise be to the Lord.
A boy. Gil. Gil!
It-It- It's a-
- It's a boy.
- It's a boy.
It's a boy.
Joe, we got a boy!
- Give me that.
Mmm.
Christian, it's a boy.
We got a baby boy.
- What?
- A baby boy!
- A boy?
- Yes!
- A baby boy?
- Sure!
And to think, at my age... another son.
- Get some brandy.
- Yes, sir.
- Brandy? For a little-
- No. For you.
Go on in.
- Is- Is she all right?
- Fit as a fiddle.
- Well, who does he look like?
- He's gonna faint. He's-
Oh, Lana, never again.
Gil.
I prayed so hard it would be a boy.
Take him in your arms, just for a moment.
Oh-
Go ahead.
Doggone.
Well, I'll be doggoned.
Yoo-hoo!
Come on, everybody! The dance is starting.
- Come on.
- I'll bet Barney never kissed you like that!
Barney McKlennar was a real man.
When he kissed you, you stayed kissed.
Let's see if he taught you how to hold your liquor.
He didn't need to.
I was born knowing that.
Hooray!
To the greatest crop in the Mohawk Valley and the man who's responsible for it...
Gil Martin!
To the bride and groom,
Mary and John Weaver.
May they always be as happy as they are tonight.
Please, God.
Please let it go on like this forever.
Come on, Gilly.
You're gonna help Mommy find some nice wild honey.
Upsy-daisy. Come on.
There we go.
- That you, Daisy? Go away. Go away.
What do you want?
What are you doing here?
Answer me! What do you mean coming in my house?
Burn house. Fire quick.
Don't you dare, you filthy drunken rascal!
Ah! Get out of here quick before I skin you alive.
Get out of here!
What are you doing?
My bed!
Ah, you crazy horse thieves!
If I could get my hands on a butcher knife!
Daisy! Daisy! Lana! Gil! Gil!
- My bed! Take your hands off that bed!
Take your- Oh!
- You go quick, old woman! You catch fire!
- Old woman!
I won't move a step without my bed.
- My husband bought this bed the day after I was married-
Stop that! Shame on you.
Get this bed out of here quick.
- Quick! Get this out of here!
- Sure. Fine. We take bed.
- Hurry up! Hurry up!
Quick! Hurry up, you fools!
I'll have your ears lopped off for this.
- Ah! Put it out!
You fools! Upside down.
Turn it upside down.
Turn it upside down.
- Turn it up! Turn it up-
You fools!
- Mrs. McKlennar! Mrs. -
- Oh! Mrs. McKlennar! What are you doing?
What are you doing?
- Away! Away!
- You've got to get out!
- Go away! Go away!
My husband built this house. I've lived in it all my life, and I'm not going to leave it.
- Go away. Go away.
- You've got to come!
- Listen to me! You cannot stay-
- Lana!
- Gil! Gil. Gil.
- Go away and leave me alone, Gil.
- Mrs. McKlennar!
Lana! Gil!
Gil! Lana! Andrusville has just been wiped out.
There's over a thousand of ‘em headed this way under Caldwell. You've got to get to the fort!
Take him. Mrs. McKlennar, you've got to come!
- I'm not leaving this house.
I've lived in it all my life.
- Come on, Sarah.
Go away! Hartman, leave me alone!
Leave me alone!
Oh, Almighty God... by whose divine assistance
Samson did smite the Philistines... hip and thigh with great slaughter... help thy people now gird up their loins for the coming battle.
Put courage in our hearts, Lord...
that we may drive our enemies back into the wilderness.
For we all know only too well what will happen to us...
if these sons of Belial ever get over these walls... or come in through that gate... which, with thy permission, Lord...
I now order closed.
Amen.
Close the gate.
Tether all the animals or drive 'em out!
You women and children, go into the church.
Hallelujah, men!
- Let's go!
If you can't get your hair under those hats, cut it off!
It won't do any good anyhow if those greasy devils get in here.
- Daisy. Daisy.
- Now sing, children. Sing in praise of the Lord.
Woman!
Brother Reall!
Put down that devil's brew.
I was only trying to get rid of it... so- so's them heathens wouldn't get it.
Beware of the heathen within thine own breast. Cast it away!
- Hallelujah!
Hallelujah.
Do you think they'll attack tonight?
With Caldwell leadin' 'em they will.
Look. What's that?
That's them.
Alarm!
- There goes our barn, off to the right of those trees.
- There goes my place.
- No, that's Ritter's.
Then mine's next to it.
Hold your fire, John. Save your ammunition.
They're just trying to draw us out.
Back to your place.
Martin's right.
Trust in the Lord, and wait until you can make every shot count.
You filthy painted heathens.
Consume them, Lord... as thou didst thine enemies in the days of Jeremiah.
Pastor! Gil! Adam!
- Wait till they're close, men!
- Adam! Here they come!
Ready with those rifles, women!
God have mercy on his soul.
I must be shooting a little to the left.
Here you are, George!
Loaded.
Now shoot the breeches off them, if they're wearin' breeches. Daisy, come on!
Loaded.
Chain shot.
Get to the gate!
Call the filthy beggars back.
We'll wait till the moon sets.
Oh, Barney! Barney, if you were only here, we'd show 'em.
We'd show-
Hold me up.
I can't breathe... lying down.
- Ah.
Lana, come beside me.
- Give me your hand.
Now don't start tuning out.
I want you and Gil to have my place- everything.
You've been like my own flesh and blood.
Oh.
Look under the front porch.
I buried... some gold pieces there, just in case.
Divide it up among the lot of you.
Gil.
Good-bye, good-lookin'.
Barney.
Barney!
- Oh!
For thine is the kingdom... the power and the glory... forever.
- Amen.
How's the ammunition, Parson?
Mighty low.
Ammunition's mighty low, Lord.
- I go Fort Dayton for help.
- That's a job for me.
- No, I'll go.
I know every foot of the way.
Anybody can make it, I can.
Joe.
Joe.
Parson, do you mind?
He'll need it.
Oneida Trail, huh, Joe?
Good luck, Joe.
He got away.
Listen.
Adam!
That's shooting, Adam!
You filthy murderers!
Just leave him-
God, our merciful father... forgive me for what
I am about to-
Amen.
Get away. I'm all right.
Gil.
What about-
Somebody's-
I'm going, Parson.
Good luck, Gil.
- Joe, did he-
- He did not.
- I'm gonna try it myself, Lana.
- Gil.
If I can make the woods,
I can outrun 'em.
They'll kill you.
You're not going to be afraid, you hear?
You're not going to.
- They'll kill you.
- No, they won't.
If I can get in the clear, there isn't an Indian living that can catch me.
Say you're not afraid and you want me to go.
Lana.
I'm not afraid.
I want you to go.
Lana, he got away.
Let 'em start.
Any sign of them yet?
Blue Back says it's quiet- too quiet out there.
He left before sunrise.
It's almost 12:00 now.
If he had reached Fort Dayton, help would be here by now.
Parson! They're over the wall!
- Every man to his post!
Pull!
Have you seen Lana?
No, I ain't, Gil.
Parson, have you seen Lana?
I killed a man.
- Lana. Lana.
It's me. It's Gil.
Oh.
Where's Caldwell?
- Where's Caldwell?
Where's Caldwell?
- Come on! Hey!
Squad left!
March!
Company halt!
- Order arms!
- At ease.
- Where are you men going?
- Home.
- Home?
The war's over. Cornwallis surrendered to Washington at Yorktown last week.
So that's our new flag, the thing we've been fighting for.
Thirteen stripes for the colonies... and 13 stars in a circle for the union.
It's a pretty flag, isn't it?
Hey, soldier, let me take that flag a minute.
- We did a little fightin' around here ourselves.
- Way up high.
- Put it up there!
- Way up to the top!
- Take it up!
- Put it up there!
Well, I reckon we better be gettin' back to work.
There's gonna be a heap to do from now on.
Gentlemen, the war is over at last.
The men are coming back.
The living are coming back.
We shall have hundreds of thousands of disbanded soldiers.
Idle men.
Men badly in need of work, Mr. President.
Gentlemen, we have the country to save fiirst.
But these men have saved their country.
Now the country must save them.
Their return home in such great numbers might paralyze industry... by furnishing suddenly a greater supply oflabor than for which there could be a demand.
Mr. President.
Mr. Colfax.
I have read an editorial in the Terra Haute Express... written by Mr.John Soule, in which he says, ''Go west, young man.''
Where there is room for all.
Gentlemen, our land stretches from an Eastern sea to a Western sea.
Surely, in that vast territory, there is a place for men to live and work and be happy.
Right,
Mr. President.
True, Mr. President.
I hope to attract our disbanded soldiers to the hidden wealth of our mountain ranges... and to the wealth that lies in the soil itself.
And to the grasslands of the Great Plains.
The fields of Illinois, the broken sod of Kansas, the long furrows of the West.
Yes, Mr. President, but if only the frontier could be made safe for the plow.
It must be made safe.
But during the war hostile Indians massacred our settlers there.
- Mr. Lincoln?
- Yes, Mary?
We'll be late for the theater.
Gentlemen, I promised to take Mrs. Lincoln to Ford's Theater tonight.
We will continue this tomorrow... for the frontier must be made safe.
Good night, Mr. President.
Good night.
Good night, Mr. President.
I have never seen him looking so well.
But the war is over, and we have on our hands order after order... canceled by the government.
Hundreds of thousands of rifles unsold.
Once we were the saviors of our country.
Now we're outcasts.
Our money invested in an unsalable product.
But a good product, gentlemen.
A new repeating rifle would have made short work of the war... had it been introduced earlier.
But now the subject of guns is an unpopular topic... to those who needed them so badly a short while ago.
We'll have to look to Providence for a market.
Providence? Where?
I've been told that the Indians hunt with bow and arrow.
Still, they obtain furs, valuable buffalo hides, otter, fox and beaver.
With our new repeating rifle--
Dearie me.
Why shouldn't we be frank?
I have every reason to believe the Indians will pay $1 00 for each rifle.
A hundred dollars?
In furs. And a dollar a piece for every cartridge.
But we can't sell rifles to the Indians!
I think we can... to peaceable Indians.
But how--
For hunting.
They furnish us with furs.
We supply them with rifles.
Really quite simple.
Won't they use those guns against white men?
We'll get the Indians to promise not to do so.
I'm against this!
But why?
It's bound to make trouble on the frontier.
President Lincoln says--
We have a perfect right to do it.
Sheer nonsense.!
The army would stop us.
They control trade with the Indians.
They did, my friend.
But Indian affairs have been taken out of the hands of the army... and given to a civilian authority.
A civilian authority?
Yep, in which we are to have a certain participation.
Do I make myself clear?
Perfectly.
But who sells the rifles?
Ask Mr. Lattimer to come in.
Perhaps not the most personable gentleman... but certainly the man for our needs.
Gentlemen, this is
Mr.John Lattimer,
How do you do? who will distribute our rifles through St. Louis... to Hays City and all the Great Plains.
Right, Mr. Lattimer?
I said I'd do it.
Van Ellyn, if ever
Mr. Lincoln finds out--
It's a legitimate business.
The Ford Theater.!
Open that window!
Lincoln shot at Ford's Theater.!
The president is dying.!
Hear that?
Someone has shot the president.
They say he's dying.
Only yesterday afternoon
I was talking to him at the Capitol.
Maybe it isn't true.
We must learn the facts.
A terrible thing,
Mr. Lattimer.
Yes, a national calamity.
You will leave at once for St. Louis.
Dearie me.
Terrible thing.
Oh, there he is.
- Excuse me, soldier!
- Bull's-eye!
I didn't see ya.
That's all right, son.
Come here and let me see your gun.
You haven't got any notches on it.
What'd I kill?
Don't you see that great big buffalo laying there kickin'?
Yeah. He's a big one, ain't he?
Give me your knife, and we'll skin 'im.
You better not.
You might find out he's been eating potatoes.
Gee, whillikens.
I'll bet you could kill a buffalo with this knife.
You can't kill a buffalo with a knife.
Aw. I'll bet
Buffalo Bill could.
You know what
I saw him do once?
What?
First give me back my Arkansas toothpick.
You give me back my gun.
I saw Buffalo Bill shoot at a whole herd of them once.
At first I thought he'd missed.
Then two of them started coughing and fell down dead.
He'd killed 'em both and raised a big cloud of dust a mile and a half the other side of them.
And that isn't all.
That little cloud of dust he raised grew into a whirlwind, turned itself into a cyclone and wiped out one-fourth ofTexas... before they could stop it.
Jimminies!
That's the kind of shootin' I aim to do.
That whistle's just a half a minute wrong.
Listen.
Don't that beat all.
Cute, isn't it?
Say, you're dressed like a scout there.
So's your sister.
That's not my sister.
That's CalamityJane.
Was she your best girl?
Son, one of these days you're gonna grow up, and you ought to know about women.
You see, the thing is this, women are, uh--
Well, they're, um--
Well, son--
I can tell you what an Indian will do to ya, but you never know what a woman will do.
Why?
Well--
Let's go down and take a look at that fire engine.
If you don't like her, what do you carry her picture around for?
It's the only good picture of me I ever had taken.
I can't cut her off without cutting off my chin.
John Lattimer, 1 7.
I see a good mark.
John Lattimer, 1 8.
Wait. I see an easy mark.
Where?
John Lattimer, 1 9.
Oh, yes.
Hello, Virginia!
I'll be around shortly.
We hate to say good-bye.
When you comin' back?
When you come and see me.
I want you to take Hannibal.
He sings.
Oh, Will, look.
I see a good fighting man who's been fool enough to get himself married.
Ow!
What's the matter?
Oh, my hats!
Jiggers! Let's duck.
Here. Hold on, bub.
Come back here.
Hey, who do you think you're--
Bill! You long-legged, fugacious old gallinipper!
What are you doin' here?
Well, I, uh--
Here's somebody who wants an introduction to you.
Boy, you wouldn't know him in these tinhorn garments, but this is the best scout west of the Mississippi.
Shake hands with Buffalo Bill.
Buffalo Bill!
Howdy, youngster.
Son, this fellow taught me all
I ever knew about scoutin'.
Ah!
You mustered out yet,
Bill?
Yesterday.
Ya ain't losin' much time gettin' up the Big Muddy.
He seems to have met a friend.
Yes, a rather strange friend.
How long have you been out?
Oh, about three months.
I see she hasn't cut your hair... yet.
I don't know what you mean, Bill.
You know what happened to Samson when Delilah opened her barbershop.
Has she tamed you yet?
That ain't fair.
She's different.
You're different.
Bill, she's the finest little gal--
I know, I know.
You gotta meet her.
No, Bill.
Women and me don't agree.
All that's goin; get aboard.!
Come on! You'll like her.
All that's goin', get aboard!
Don't be nervous.
He'll be here.
Come, Will!
Hurry.!
All right, Lou.
I want you to meet the best friend--
We haven't time.
We must get on the boat.
All that's goin; get aboard.!
Bye, Buffalo Bill!
Bye!
Bye, Louisa.!
Good-bye!
Honey, we're on our way.
You're not frightened, are ya?
I'm not frightened of anything after these three wonderful months.
It's a big place we're going to-- the West-- isn't it?
Good-bye, Buffalo Bill!
Huh?
What's the matter, boy?
Good-bye, bub. That's yours.
Gee! Thanks, mister!
Don't forget what I told ya about women.
And here's your gun.
Good hunting!
I'm Jack McCall,
Mr. Hickok.
Tickled to death to be traveling with you.
Pleased to meet you.
Hey, your toothpick's on fire.
This ain't a toothpick.
''Cigareetes,'' they call them back East.
Oh, I see.
A new fad, huh?
Hmm?
Barkeep, bring me an applejack, will ya?
Yes, sir.
You want one?
No.
I call ya.
I have ace, king, queen, jack and a ten.
Sorry, mister.
Mr. Hickok.
I'd like to speak to you.
Good evening, ma'am.
I'm Louisa Cody.
Will's told me how long you've been friends... and how you fought for him once.
He says you don't trust women.
Not as a rule, Mrs. Cody.
But in your case--
Mr. Hickok,
I'm going to help Will.
Don't you believe I can?
Well, I don't know, ma'am.
I'll open.
He killed his first Indian at 1 2.
But he's not--
At 1 4, he was riding Pony Express.
He's one of the best natural scouts on the frontier.
Will's promised to give up scouting and killing Indians... and all that nonsense.
The West is in his blood.
You can't change that.
But you've been away from it so long.
It is changing, and why shouldn't
Will change with it?
We're going to start a little hotel.
Cody?
Yes.
Someday you may be one of our neighbors with a wife of your own.
Excuse me, ma'am, but the hotel keeper seems to be in trouble... with his neighbors right now.
I'll bet you $20.
Hello, Bill.
Don't play that hand.
- Why not?
- Maybe you can trust one woman-- authorities differ-- but three?
Not on your life.
Your wife wants to talk to you.
She's outside.
Well, if you don't mind, gentlemen.
It's all right.
How much money did you lose?
About $48.
I'll sit in for you.
Any objections, gentlemen?
No, no objections at all.
We've got new blood in the game.
Heinie.
Yes, sir?
Take the gentlemen's order.
Take the order all around.
Rye for me.
Applejack, please.
Rye.
No, thank you.
Ante.
Cut.
Heinie?
Yes, sir.
Bring me something cool.
Yes, sir.
Well,
I'll bet you $50.
I'll see that and raise you 1 00.
On that watch?
Yes, it's a mighty fine watch.
Plays a tune whenever you press that little spring. See?
It ain't worth $1 50.
It is to me.
I'll redeem that watch anytime for a thousand.
All right, I'll take your word on it, and I'll up ya 300.
And I'll call ya.
They're all blue, mister.
Watch yourself.
What's the matter?
I'm calling the hand that's in your hat.
Take it off!.
Take a look,
Mr.Jayhawker.
The name is Hickok.
Hickok?
Not Wild Bill Hickok?
Mr. Hickok to you.
I'm calling this hand.
And I'm taking this pot.
Maybe I ought to shoot a couple of holes through your ears, so we'll know you.
Men like you ought to be marked.
Maybe he'll do it too.
Wouldn't be no trick at all for Bill.
He's my friend.
He can hit a dime at 30 paces.
Four times out of five.
Five times out of five.
He killed the whole McDaniels gang.
And he got 'em alone too.
Does he kill like that?
Ain't a corpse maker like him, honey.
Cash these in, Mr. Banker.
It's a pleasure,
Mr. Hickok.
Maybe I ought to take
Mr. Cody's losings too.
He's got a wife to support.
Whoa there!
Lizzie's two hours late.
Hustle your passengers off.
I'll pick the best of them for you, Calamity.
My horses ain't used to waitin'.
Back up there,Joe!
Mark three!
Look out!
Don't foul that hauser there!
Hey, there.!
Leavenworth landing!
All for Leavenworth get off.
Hey! Aboard there!
Purser!
Watch the line.
My name's John Lattimer.
You got a bunch of freight for me put aboard at St. Louis?
Yeah, lots of it consigned to Hays City.
I got my own wagons here!
I want that stuff shouldered off first up!
Right away! Hey, Tim!
Hustle that shipment forJohn Lattimer off.
Come on, boys!
Get goin'!
Hi, Calamity.
Hi, yourself.
Keepin' company tonight?
Yeah, me and my six horses.
Seven's a lucky number.
Count me in.
You sailors are all alike.
Hey, Bill!
Help me pack this outfit ashore.
Jumping Jehoshaphat!
What is this? Feathers?
Hats.
''Hats''?
Lou, Bill will take you off to the stage. I got to go see about the trunks.
This going to be the hotel orchestra, ma'am?
Bill, we're not joking about that hotel.
I guess a hotel suits you after all. Start with a birdcage and expand, huh?
Lattimer, six.
Come on, boys.!
Get along here.!
Lattimer, seven.
Lattimer, eight.
Keep 'em on your backs there.
I'm sorry, boss.
Powerful heavy to tote.
- Shut your lip!
John Lattimer, nine.
Hey!
Take this box!
Yes, sir!
Get out, you!
John Lattimer, ten.
Lattimer, 1 1, goin'to Hays City.
Don't that look like--
Farming tools.
You operate out of Hays City?
Sure! What of it?
Didn't have any use for farming tools the last time I was there.
I freight whatever they send me, and I mind my own business.
John Lattimer, 1 5.
That's a right good idea, a right, good way to keep out of trouble.
John Lattimer, 1 6.
Bill!
You mangy old coyote!
Ha!
John Lattimer, 1 8.
Bill, you're back.
Aw, you four-flushing mule.
You ain't wipin' it off.
You're rubbing it in.
Are you gonna stay in Leavenworth?
Are you?
I could.
I'm going on to Hays City.
Why didn't you write me any letters, Bill?
I didn't know you could read.
I could read if you could write.
A woman who has a fellow at every stage station... and a beau in every cavalry troop west of the Missouri--
That woman doesn't need any letters from me.
Those fellers didn't mean nothin' to me.
They did to me.
Let's forget it.
Maybe I did make a mistake.
You won't get a chance to make that mistake again.
Bill!
You'll have to excuse me.
I'm keeping a lady waiting.
I'm awfully sorry to have put you to so much trouble, Mr. Hickok.
That's all right.
I don't know what could have happened to Will.
This is the Hays City stage, ma'am. I'll fetch Will and the rest of the outfit.
Thank you.
Is that chipmunk yours?
Did ya bring her with ya?
What if I did?
It's none of your business.
Ain't it, after you run out on me?
You slab-sided, bird-totin' rat!
You brung that honky-tonk mopsy--
Shut up, Calamity.
Tip your hat when you speak to a lady.
I will, when I speak to a lady.
Aw, Bill.
Careful, Lou.
That's a big step.
Look out for Hannibal.
Will, isn't it exciting?
Have you got everything?
I've got you and the parasol and Hannibal... and boxes and hats and--
Hi, Calamity!
Well, Bill Cody!
What are you doin' in them buzzard feathers?
Pretty fancy, huh?
Calamity, I want to introduce you.
Lou, this is CalamityJane.
Everybody knows her.
Born and bred out yonder.
A dead shot, rides better than a man, drives stage.
Why, I've seen her flick the rattles off a rattle--
Say, is she your mopsy?
She's Mrs. Cody.
Your wife!
Aw.
I'm certainly glad to know ya, Mrs. Cody.
How do you do, Miss Calamity?
Canary's the name, ma'am.
I beg your pardon.
I didn't know.
Not at all, ma'am.
Four passengers for Hays City, Calamity.
Get going.
Suits me.
You'll find the backseat easy ridin', Mrs. Cody.
Thank you.
Come on, Bill. Get in.
That's no way to treat your passengers.
You ain't a passenger.
You're freight.
My name's Jack McCall.
I'm goin' to Hays City.
What are you smokin'?
Chalk?
Cigareete.
Well, get in anyway.
Another one for Hays City, ma'am.
That river clipper's sayin' good-bye to you, ma'am.
Now you're gonna have three long days of this prairie clipper.
But tomorrow's Sunday.
Do we ride on Sunday?
There's no Sunday west ofJunction City, no law west of Hays City and no God west of Carson City.
Hold tight, ma'am.
I'm holding tight.
Still travelin' together,
Mr. Hickok, huh?
What are you doin' up here?
I'm drivin'.
Get! Get up there!
Get up there!
You've been driving for three days.
You've changed horses
1 4 times.
Don't you ever change those beads you're wearing?
I ain't wearin' 'em
'cause you give 'em to me.
I'm wearin' 'em
'cause I like beads.
Oh, Will, are all the roads in Kansas like this?
No, honey!
Some of'em are pretty bad.
What's the matter?
Clem?
Take these ribbons.
Yeah?
Stranger, I wonder if you could--
Breezy!
Why, it's Bill Hickok.
I thought you was off to the war.
The war's over.
Yeah? Just beginning where I come from.
There's 2,000 or 3,000
Sioux Indians cayoodlin' around
Fort Piney with war paint on.
Wild Bill Hickok to see General Custer.
I'll see him.
Yes, sir.
How do you do, General?
Oh, hello, Hickok.
I heard you were coming to town.
I know of your reputation as a killer, and I want to warn you... that we'll tolerate no lawlessness here at Hays City.
You better get that word through to the Indians, because they've just wiped out half the garrison at Fort Piney.
- How do you know?
- I was about to report to you... before you became so interested in my accomplishments... that we've been pulling arrows out of
Colonel Carrington's old scout.
Breezy?
Yes.
Colonel Carrington told him if you didn't get ammunition to Fort Piney, they're done for.
Find Captain Reed!
Yes, sir.
I'll get that ammunition to Fort Piney somehow.
But I can't spare more than one troop to take it.
Here at Hays City,
I'm faced by Satanta's Kiowas.
The whole Sioux nation's up here.
And now Yellow Hand's on the loose with his Cheyenne.
I can't move from Hays City until I find out where that he-wolf s heading for.
He's an old friend of mine.
We used to hunt buffalo together on the Cimarron.
He's hunting men now, and I've got to locate him.
Maybe I can find him for ya.
He ought to be just about... there.
Hmph.
Oh, Captain Reed.
Yes, sir.
Hickok reports that half of Carrington's command at Fort Piney's been wiped out.
I'm sending 1 0,000 rounds of ammunition.
Have Captain Woods prepare to leave at once with a wagon train.
Mules are right handy animals, General.
What?
They can get by the Indians much better than wagons can.
Yes, he's right.
Use mules.
They'll have to get by about a thousand Cheyenne.
Why not send them east of the trail through Deep Valley?
Yes, and across the upper ford of the Republican, but who's going to guide them?
I haven't got a scout who knows that territory.
I beg your pardon, but Buffalo Bill Cody just got in town.
Cody? Yes, he knows the lay of that land.
And he's up to all Indian tricks.
He's got himself a squaw.
You'll probably find him knitting or washing dishes.
What do you mean?
He's married a ravishing little woman from points East.
I don't care if he married an Eskimo.
Tell him to come here.
His mind's set on starting a hotel.
There's an Indian war starting.
Women lying on these plains with Indian arrows in them.
Get Cody here.
- Suppose I go in his place?
- You're going after Yellow Hand.
Don't let him catch you.
He doesn't treat his prisoners very well.
Tell Cody that ammunition train is leaving before sundown.
Yes, sir.
And he'll be leaving with them.
Orderly.
Oh, Will, there's so much dirt blowing in.
It's got to blow someplace, honey.
Tumbleweed, Lou.
They won't bite ya.
Oh, dear!
There's no use fightin' the wind, Lou.
We have to bear with this land.
Oh, I know, Will.
When are we going to move into town and take over the hotel?
I'm gonna see
Jeb Masters tomorrow.
He wants to sell the Golden Rule House.
Here's your grub!
Why, come in, Miss Canary.
Hiya, Bill.
What'd you bring?
Well, I'll tell ya.
I got something to fry, and I got something to boil.
And a jug of whiskey!
Oh!
He never misses, Mrs. Cody.
I'll take that.
You've got a lot to do.
That stove smokes, and there's no mattress on the bed.
You haven't got the lamps filled yet.
Look at this place.
This is a grand shebang.
Oh, Calamity.
You could stable the queen of Sheba.
How can you say that?
It's so dusty, and I haven't got my curtains hung yet.
We'll help ya. Hey, you long-legged two-spot, give your wife a hand.
And here's the bodkin.
Hey!
Put it in that window.
Say! Look it.
That would make a pretty dress, wouldn't it?
Calamity, do you ever wear dresses?
I might if I had one.
You're going to look awfully nice in one of mine.
That curtain looks right pretty.
Bodkin Bill.
Have you had any experience with a horse blanket?
Plenty.
Lou says I've had too much.
That's too bad.
There's a horse outside waitin' for ya now.
You tryin' to trade, Bill?
Yes.
A hotel for the lives of 48 men... and 1 0,000 rounds of ammunition thrown in.
How do you do,
Mr. Hickok?
You and the bird feel at home yet, ma'am?
Won't you sit down?
Thank you.
Is Custer sending that ammunition to Fort Piney?
He's hoping they'll get through... if 48 cavalrymen can dodge about 1 ,000 Cheyenne.
Birds do not eat beans,
Mr. Hickok.
You think those swatties can make it?
Depends which way
Custer sends 'em.
Through Deep Valley.
Through the upper ford of the Republican.
Yeah. They might get through that way.
They would get through if Bill Cody showed them how.
There's no trail.
Better no trail if they're dodging Cheyenne.
Will's not going.
He has nothing to do with the army now.
He's promised.
That's just what I told Custer.
What did you tell him?
That you wouldn't go.
You know that's a lie.
Mr. Hickok,
Will promised me.
You don't understand.
I can't let him go.
There are things that have to be done, ma'am.
Lincoln set a goal that we have to work toward.
He said the frontier must be made safe.
Oh, but
Lincoln's dead.
What right have the dead to tell the living what to do?
His words are alive.
Bill Cody knows that as well as I do.
If he refuses to go, you'll think he's a coward, and you know he's not.
The choice is his, ma'am.
Will, I was afraid of this.
You can't leave me.
You can't--
You've never seen the Indian tribes at war.
You've never seen men killed and mutilated and bodies of women burned... and babies dragged from their mother's arms and dashed against--
That's enough, Bill!
Why is it you aren't going, Mr. Hickok?
I have to pay a call on an old friend.
You're goin' after Yellow Hand.
Bill, you're goin' out alone!
You cold decker, ain't you got no sense?
Maybe I can get you another string of beads.
Ya ornery coot!
Good-bye, my darling.
Oh, Will, please--
I've got to go, dear.
I know every foot of the way.
I have to do my part.
Here.
I'll look out for you, Mrs. Cody.
He'll be back in a few days.
He'll be back with nary a scratch on him.
Will! Will!
Come back!
Don't cry, honey.
I wanted to tell him something.
What?
Maybe if he'd known, he wouldn't have gone.
Oh.
Well, maybe it's just as well you didn't tell him.
What is this, Louisy?
Cat?
It's sort of a Russian cat.
Say.
Look at that.
I don't know how I look, but I feel like the queen of Sheba.
You look lovely,
Calamity.
I want you to keep that dress.
Ya do?
Say, that's the first time a woman ever gave me anything.
Why, I never even seen clothes like these.
Now, if I just had me a hat!
Here, try one of these.
Oh, say, ain't that a pretty one.
Well, how do you do,
Miss Canary?
Hmph.
Hmph. Appears to me your face is kind of made out of rubber.
That old coyote's got a toad in his gullet.
Couldn't be an Indian, could it?
Honey, when you hear something yelling at night, it's just some varmint.
But when you don't hear nothin', it's an Injun.
Calamity, I want you to stay here with me.
I've never been alone before.
Now, stop worryin' about him, honey.
He's got a whole troop of cavalry ridin' herd on him.
But my Bill plays it alone, the big mule.
I bet if he could see me in this outfit, it'd be my weddin' dress.
I'd just as leave die with my boots on, but I ain't a-gonna to get married in 'em.
Can I have some shoes?
Louisy, don't look at the windows.
Don't let on anything's different.
Listen to me.
Can you ride?
Yes.
My horse is outside.
Take that coffeepot back to the stove.
Then open that door and wait.
Make believe you're helping me with my glove.
I'm gonna entertain visitors. They're Injuns.
Injuns!
Shut up. When you see them all in here, sneak to the horse.
Ride to town.
Don't stop for nothin'.
Tell 'em there's Injuns here with war paint on.
Make me some fresh coffee, honey.
Come in, fellows.
Come on in.
Don't be afraid.
I-- I got something for ya.
Look. I got some presents for ya.
See? See the pretty feather?
Sure. Sure.
It's a hat. See?
Here. Here, put it on.
Come on.
I'll show you.
Go look at the pretty feather, you painted buzzard.
Here. Here, look.
Pretty?
You don't like it, huh?
Well, here. Take this.
I got something for all of ya.
Presents for all of you.
We've been savin' 'em.
Look.
Presents for my brothers, the Cheyenne, you red hyenas.
Here. Look. See?
Look. Here.
Come on in. Look.
See? Here.
Come on.
Don't be afraid.
Look. For papoose.
See? Papoose.
Uh, want a piece of cake?
Soldier.
''Soldier''?
Me no talk Cheyenne.
I'll never tell ya where they've gone, ya hairless coyote!
Hello there! Hey!
Bill.!
You get outta here.!
Go back, Bill!
These are Yellow Hand's men.!
You're crazy.!
Shoot your way out, Bill!
You'll get a tomahawk in your brains if you keep askin' for it.
Indians will sell anything.
They might sell you.
Wild Bill Hickok, walkin' into the hands of a war party.
Custer sure picked himself a great scout.
Aw, Bill, not your watch.
What's he saying, Bill?
He wants my guns too.
Don't give 'em to him.
Don't give up your guns!
What's he saying?
He says he's got to take us to Yellow Hand first.
He can't let us go unless Yellow Hand's willing.
Well, you done it, didn't ya?
Yes, I ''done it,'' all right.
How do you do,
Mr. Hickok?
You sure must remember me.
How do you like me in dresses?
Thought you were Mrs. Cody at first, in that dress.
Oh. Mrs. Cody give it to me.
Were you in Cody's cabin when they caught ya?
Yeah, celebrating on account of Bill Cody's kid.
Bill Cody hasn't got a kid.
He's gonna have one.
He doesn't know it, does he?
He would if he stayed home where he belongs.
I'll tell him... maybe.
Say, Bill, you give up your watch... and your guns.
Couldn't have been on account of me, could it?
No. I wanted him to take me to Yellow Hand, so I can find out what he's up to.
Oh.
What do you think they'll do to us?
We'll soon find out.
You Hickok.
I know you.
Speak your own language, Yellow Hand.
I'll understand you.
You, me, speak white man tongue.
I must know you know what I say.
Remember what I told you last time we met?
I said one of us will lift the other's scalp.
Which one?
It looks like it's up to you to say.
What started you on the warpath, Yellow Hand?
Where sun rise, white man's land.
Where sun set,
Indian land.
White man come, take our land.
Kill buffalo, our food.
White man promise us food.
White man lie.
Now Cheyenne buy white man's thunder stick.
Soon war drums sound in all Indian land.
All tribes ride with Yellow Hand.
We drive white man, like buffalo, away, back to rising sun.
Yellow Hand has spoken.
Yellow Hand has spoken.
And you may be right.
But you can't drive the white man away.
Yellow Hand know.
White man send bullet.
Many, many bullet. Where?
Somebody's romancing Yellow Hand.
You tell where.
I don't know.
You tell where!
He's your friend, Bill.
Why don't you tell him they're heading east toward Leavenworth?
Yes, that's right.
To Leavenworth.
- Now I know soldier take bullet.
- They won't fit your guns.
Hickok, my friend, speak with straight tongue.
Hickok, white man friend, speak with forked tongue.
Now, you tell, which way soldier take bullet?
Bill, what's in that watch?
Bill! Bill, you got my picture. You kept it.
I couldn't get it out without scratching the case.
You've been actin' like you didn't care, and all the time--
Tie up that tongue of yours.
Look at their faces.
Let her go.
She doesn't know anything.
You too quick to say she not know.
Hickok will not tell, but Yellow Hand will know.
Now is hour of Great Bear rising.
When moon in sky here,
Yellow Hand will know.
What's he talking about the moon for?
What does he mean?
What are you thinking about?
I'm thinking about
John Lattimer's farming tools... that came up on the boat.
Oh, rifles.
Better rifles than we have.
Seven shot repeaters, and each shot may mean the life of a white man.
But what do you think they're fixin' to do to us?
I think maybe you gave them an idea what to do.
Hear them drums?
That's taps for us, ain't it, Bill?
Won't be so hard, goin' out together.
It'll be harder than you know.
Calamity, there are only two of us.
Two lives against all those men on the ammunition train.
But I don't want to die!
I don't want you to die!
Hang onto yourself.
You'll have to help me.
Just like you did the first time
I saw you, remember?
I was just a kid and no more sense than I got now, headin' down the grade with no brakes on.
I loved you then, Bill, just like I do now.
Looks like that moon's gettin' ready to show.
You never even gave me a picture, but you kept mine.
I know you care for me a little.
Couldn't you say it just once?
Maybe they'll let us go after all.
Bill Hickok!
You ornery son of a mule!
You wouldn't give a bad dime to a sick kid, would ya?
You may be right,
Calamity.
No, I ain't.
I know it.
I ain't worth a bad dime.
Bill-- Bill, every night
I talk to ya.
Wantin' ya.
I know you feel the same.
Won't you tell me?
What difference would that make now?
If only I could hear ya say it once.
It would give me somethin' to keep... like it was kind of holy, like I could keep it forever.
Calamity--
Yellow Hand find out now which way soldier go.
Bill.
Yes, Calamity, I do.
I--
I love you.
You wait.
Yellow Hand no want to kill Hickok... but must know which way soldier go with bullet.
When he know,you go free.
Hickok go free.
Don't talk to him,
Calamity!
Don't trust him!
Bill.!
Bill!
If you no tell which way soldier go with bullet,
Hickok soon be dead.
Bill Cody's with that ammunition train!
Forty-eight men are there, Calamity!
Oh, Bill! I can't!
You tell?
No.
Which way?
Oh, no! No! Don't!
Don't let them do it!
Don't! Please! Don't!
Oh!
Which way?
Don't forget Cody--
And all those men!
Remember what I told you!
They're burning him!
They're killing him!
Put out the fire!
Put out the fire!
Oh.!
Put out the fire!
Which way soldier go with bullet?
Deep Valley through the upper ford.
Squaw no lie.
Yellow Hand no lie.
You free. Go.
I couldn't help it, Bill.
Won't you look at me?
I hope
I'll never have to look at you again.
Look out, Bill!
Look out!
Thing ain't right here,
Captain Wood.
See anything?
No, but I feel it.
Things ain't right here.
We can halt over there while you take a look around.
They're caught, like rats in a trap.
They're all around us, on both sides of the river!
- We'll hold this island!
Throw your horses!
Get those ammunition packs off.
Get them out of the line of fire!
I can't see nothin' to shoot at but smoke.
Where are they?
They'll never get out now.
I gotta go down there.
You ain't goin' down there.
Get behind this tree and wait.
You've got to reach
General Custer.
I'll get there, somehow.
Head down Prairie Dog Creek.
Get a fresh mount tomorrow from the Pony Express at Simpson's.
And if Custer finds out you told Yellow Hand, he'll give you the firing squad.
He won't find out.
I'm gonna tell him.
Tell him you brought a thousand Cheyenne against his 48 men!
Set up that barricade with those saddles! Those saddles on those barricades, and hurry!
Don't go too deep with that hole or you'll get that ammunition in water!
All right, sir.
Burned through the legs.
It feels like it broke the bone.
Your knife, Bill.
Give me that scabbard for the splint.
Watch 'em, men!
They may rush us!
Never saw such rifle-fire from Indians!
They haven't let up for a minute.
There's either a million of'em, or they're using those new repeating rifles.
Look out!
They're firin' powerful fast.
It ain't like what we had at Gettysburg.
Were you at Gettysburg?
I was on the other side in that.
Then you must've been--
- Stop talkin', you two!
- Get down there!
Aim well and fire slowly.
Hold your fire, men!
That's a white man!
Cover him, McGinnis!
Cover him!
What would a white man be doin' out there?
Holy mackerel!
He hasn't got a chance!
He's still ridin'.
Drop some of them Injuns back of him!
That fellow must have nine lives!
He'll need every one of'em.
They got him!
No, they haven't!
Come on, Bill.!
Run for it.!
Keep those long legs goin'!
Hi, Bill.
Sufferin' cats!
Wild Bill!
I'll tell the captain you're here.
Tell him I expect to be here for a long time.
Hi, Bill.
You guidin' for Yellow Hand?
Where's your feathers?
Captain Wood,
Wild Bill Hickok.
Touch 'em up in those trees.
Range about 200 yards!
Hickok?
Wild Bill Hickok?
Yes, sir. He just dropped in from Yellow Hand.
Wha--
I thought Custer sent you to locate Yellow Hand.
I located him, didn't I?
Him and a few Cheyenne.
You sure did a good job.
I notice you're using his equipment.
You'll notice it's better than yours too.
Where did you get that mark on your wrist? Bracelet?
Ha. Squaw bracelet.
Takin' Bill Hickok prisoner just don't sound right to me.
No? What about Bill Cody following his nose into a Cheyenne ambush?
Hmm.
Looky here.
These Injuns were waitin' for us. They knew we was comin' to this ford.
You didn't tell 'em, Bill?
Then who did tell 'em?
I said, who did tell 'em?
I've something more important than that to tell you.
You're gonna be a father.
Huh?
A daddy.
Well, but, uh--
How did you know?
Mrs. Cody told Calamity.
Calamity told me.
Well, somebody mighta told me.
Well, uh... the news didn't leak out till after we left.
Oh, well then how--
Where did you see Calamity?
Oh, uh... around.
Has she got rawhide marks on her wrist too?
What's your guess it'll be, a boy or a girl?
It's bound to be one or the other, isn't it?
That's customary.
From what I've seen of you lately, my guess is a girl.
Girls are all right.
If it's a boy,
I suppose he'll be a bellboy in that hotel of yours.
If it's a girl, we'll keep her out of Yellow Hand's camp.
Oh!
Hey, Bill.
Hey, soldier.
Wait till I knock the tail feathers off of that turkey.
Help me over to the wagon with him.
They got Buffalo Bill,
Captain.
Keep down or they'll get you.
Where's the doctor, Captain?
They got him in the first volley.
Bandages are in the box there.
Here's a fresh one.
Sort of parted your hair,
Bill. Flesh wound.
Looks like that little stranger's gonna have a papa.
Never mind that.
We got plenty of water in the river.
Hickok.
Yes, sir?
It's gonna be a siege.
Days of it.
After dark, I'll call for volunteers to try to get back to General Custer.
I've already sent word to Custer.
Who'd you send?
Who'd you send?
- CalamityJane.
Calamity? Wha--
She oughta get through.
She'd better get through.
There you are.
I oughta have you stood up and shot.
Why don't you?
If I had the authority to do it,
I'd like nothing better, but I haven't.
I can't make you pay for what you've done.
You won't have to.
Ten hut.!
Captain Wood.
Lieutenant Burke.
Sergeant Higgins.
Corporal Brannigan.
Here today and gone tomorrow.
- Bugler Corry.
- Here, but not for long.
Seven days you been calling that roll. Tomorrow there won't be anyone left to answer it.
Then I'll answer 'em all myself.
Private Adams. Anderson.
Here, and I wish I wasn't.
I wish I had two more like you.
Bingham.
Six nights I've been listenin' to the wild talk of the wounded.
'Tis a sad lullaby.
Bronson.
Yo. What's left of me.
Cody.
- Here.
- He's up in his hotel.
Coleman.
Still here.
-Three days now since the mule meat went bad.
- It's six, I tell ya!
Why tell the Indians?
They know about it.
Keep quiet, you baboons!
Seven. Do you think you're the only one hearin' Rankin in sick bay... talkin'half the time about that hole through his lung and the rest about his kid?
He's so scared he can't count.
It's six nights.
This paper says they're expectin' trouble with the Indians.
Huh?
- No?
- Dalrymple?
Here, and hungry.
Try chewin' saddle leather.
That'll ease your stomach.
Aw.
Daniels. Dowden.
Yo.
Easton. Evans. Hickok.
No hits.
- They're savin' him for a hangin'.
- Houston.
Yo.
Hadley. Hillman.
What are you makin' that for?
Holliston.
Sure, and all the Indians won't be makin' no headstone for me.
Jenkins.
Seven days you been doin' this.
They don't answer anymore.
He's roll calling the dead!
It's six days!
What difference does it make?
''What difference does it make''?
Makes a difference to Gillon,
Harry Ketcham and Bailey.
Ray Todd must think it makes a difference where he lies out there.
They might be alive!
Alive!
Easy, son. Easy.
They might be.
You never can tell what'll happen.
I knew a fellow lived on the Kaw River by the bridge.
He used to feed a fish, a big catfish, by hand.
- What's that got to do with it?
- Now wait a minute.
That catfish got to followin' that fellow out of water for his dinner.
Every day he'd follow him more.
And one night when the man was walkin'home across the bridge, not noticin'the catfiish was followin'him.
Now that fiish had never seen a bridge before.
He fell off... and he drowned.
- Ah, fish can't drown.
- That must've been a narrow bridge.
Holy thunder.!
Look at them Injuns.!
Every man up this way!
Hurry, men, hurry!
- Get the wounded out to load the guns!
- Don't shoot till
I give the command.
- Hand me up another rifle.
- Keep your heads down if you wanna keep them on.
Look like buffalo, don't they?
A volley'll stop buffalo.
Volley fire. Ready!
Not yet.
But, Bill!
Hold your fire, men.
Wait for the command.
- They're riding us down!
- Don't wait.! Let 'em have it.!
Not yet!
Now!
Fire!
Load faster.!
Gimme that.!
I'm doing the best I can.
Fire at the center!
Split that charge!
Fire!
- Who was that?
- Keep your barrels red hot!
Fire at will, men!
This one's mine!
- We've turned 'em!
- Now they're goin' down both sides!
Houston!Jack!
Cover the left flank!
Where are you going, you idiot?
Hey, Bill, come back here!
Are you crazy?
- Hey, Dave, help me cover him.
- Cover the right flank!
Load your guns, men!
Load your guns! Remember, you're still in the army.
Gimme some water.
I gotta have water.
What's the matter?
Can't you hear me?
Load your guns.!
- What's the use? We can't stand another charge.
- We may have to.
No.! We can't.
The dead can't fiight anymore.
Why don't you call roll now?
You're afraid? I'll call it for you. Private Dowden.!
- You load your guns!
- Corporal Brannigan.
Load your guns.!
Why don't you tell
Brannigan to load his gun?
- I'm telling you.! Get up.!
- I won't!
Save that fighting for the Indians!
You'll see.
Hold onto yourself, fella.
There's nobody left.
You'll see.
Why don't you tell your bugler to sound assembly?
Stop blubbering and reload your gun!
He can't answer.
Look at him.!
Look at him.!
Saints above.
He's answering to his name.
Yes, it's the dead calling.
- Stop it, men!
Stop it. Listen.
It's Bugler Corry.
He's sounding the charge!
Come on, men, it's a charge!
No, you fools! No!
What are you waiting for?
The dead want us.
McGinnis, hold 'em back.
Fall in men!
- It's the charge.
Don't ya hear it?
- Yes, I hear it.
Come on, follow me!
The boy's right.
It's horses.
They're charging.
Get ready, men!
We'll go down fightin'!
Come on.!
There they are, over there!
You can see 'em!
- Holy saints!
[ Bugle Playing ''Charge'' ]
They know we're alive.
We're okay.
Well, Yellow Hand didn't get that ammunition he was hankerin' for.
He would have, if Calamity hadn't gotten through to Custer.
She did a good job, all right.
- She must've told Yellow Hand.
- Let her alone.
She never was good.
Why don't somebody do somethin'about it?
Only 1 8 come back out of 48.
The Cheyenne must've paid her plenty to tell 'em.
Paid this woman in money, but our soldiers paid in blood.
What are you gonna do?
I'll show you what we're gonna do.
Talk's cheap, ya loudmouthed liar.
Hey, you.
Let me out!
All right, you dirty mule-skinner.
If you want it-- Ow!
If she was a man, we'd know what to do with her.
Go ahead, you crossbred rat!
If you was a man, you wouldn't be here!
Run her out of town!
Get some tar.!
Tar and feathers is too good for her.
That's the way to talk!
Get a rail.!
Here. Here's a rail.
Gimme that hammer.
Why don't somebody get behind her and get that whip?
- Why don't you?
- Get the feathers and tar.
There's a rail.
What do you want with a rail,Jack?
- Bill!
- We're gonna run her out of town.
Why?
You know what she done?
She told Indians--
Well, she's a woman, isn't she?
Keep out of this, Bill Hickok.
And women talk a little too much sometimes.
This woman is gonna get what's coming to her.
Let's ride her out of town.
And men talk a little too much sometimes too!
Those men had wives.
I know what's on your minds!
Yes, there were soldiers killed.
I was there.
I saw them.
Huh?
And they were killed with bullets-- bullets from repeating rifles.
Who'd sell rifles to Indians?
Lincoln said this country's got to be made safe.
Those are his words.
And I'm on my way to settle this matter with the man who sold those rifles.
It wouldn't please me to be the man Bill Hickok's goin' after.
Me neither!
I knew there was monkey business goin'on.
You're right.
And there's liable to be bullets flyin' around this way any minute, so I'd advise you to get inside, off the street.
Well--
I was goin' home anyway.
- I'll go with you,Jack.
- I got a long ways to go myself.
Lattimer's ''crookeder'' than a rattlesnake. You can't go after him alone. His men--
I started this alone and I'll finish it alone.
Why should I stake you to go diggin' for gold?
They found gold and plenty of it right there in the Black Hills.
That's Sioux country.
That don't matter. There's gold there at the grass roots.
So, you're goin' on the dodge, desertin' after gold.
You know what Custer does to deserters.
I know what he'd like to do to you.
He just got back and he's boilin' mad about Cheyenne
Indians and repeatin' rifles.
He can't do nothin'. Let him make his complaint to Washington and he'll find that out!
The army's gettin' riled--
The army can't stop me!
There's bigger men than the army in this with me.
Mr. Lattimer.
I'm busy, McCall.
I want to do you a big favor, Lattimer.
What's on your mind?
Hickok's after you.
Wild Bill.
He says you're the cause of all these Indian massacres.
He's comin' in here now.
All right.
You better get out.
You won't forget that I warned you?
Get out.
Get in there, you three.
Maybe I'll have a job for you.
Hello, Hickok.
That's the name, ain't it?
Met you in Leavenworth.
Hear you been doin' a little scoutin' for Custer.
Did you see anything?
Yellow Hand's been farming with your farming tools.
You know what this is?
Skunk.
Yes.
I'm not armed, Mr. Hickok.
I'm not armed.
I'll give you three minutes to fix that.
I'll be waiting outside.
- I'm just leaving town.
- You're not leaving town unless dead men can walk.
Come in here, you fellows.
Now. I'm gonna stake ya, all three of you.
I'm gonna stake you to 50 Double Eagles.
I've got a wagon train leaving for the Black Hills tonight.
I'm gonna get you away from
Custer and safe out of town.
That's great, Mr. Lattimer.
But first, there's that little job I want you boys to do for me.
You're crazy. Lattimer won't fight you fair. You ain't got the sense you was born with.
Ah, Bill, don't our love mean nothin' to ya?
Our love-- if that's what you want to call it-- all that died back on that island where everything else was dying.
No, Bill, no!
I'll go get Cody.
Maybe he can talk some sense into you, ya big mule!
Get off the street.
You better take cover for a few minutes.
You think you own this town.
I'm just walkin' through it.
And us fellas can get out of your way, can't we, just like we was dirt?
Suit yourself.
All right, Mr. Long Hair.
You're too durn friendly with Injuns to suit me.
You shouldn't have said that, soldier.
What are you gonna do about it, ya gun-totin' windbag?
Oh, substituting for Lattimer.
I can't shoot at that uniform.
If you want action, take it off.
Yeah, and get a slug while I'm doin' it.
Take it off.
I'll give you that much time.
I never draw on a man who isn't ready.
- Bill.! Bill.!
Come on, Bill, let's get out of here.
Sit here, Bill, out of sight.
Close that door, Lou.
Easy, Bill.
That bullet went clean through, but it's bleedin' bad.
Get some water, Lou, quick.
And some clean linen.
You brought this man to our house; a murderer.
Lou!
When is this going to stop?
When will it ever stop?
This killing and killing!
Why don't they kill him too?
Then you can be next and then me and--
Lou, he's my friend.
I didn't mean to bother you, ma'am. I'll be going.
Can I take your horse, Bill?
You can have everything
I've got, Bill, but--
You sit right down again,
Mr. Hickok.
You can't go bleeding like that, whatever you've done.
He's done plenty.
Those men were soldiers.
He'll have every trooper of the Seventh after him now.
Get some towels, Will.
I'll be as quick as I can, Mr. Hickok.
Thank you, ma'am.
Here you are, Lou.
There's hot water on the stove.
Hold this, Mr. Hickok.
I never was a murderer.
I never did fight unless put upon.
Thou shalt not kill.
No ghosts ever come bothering me.
It was always the other man or me... in a fair fight.
What right have you to judge who is to live or to die?
Put away your guns,
Mr. Hickok.
I can't do that, ma'am, not till I find John Lattimer.
Hey,Jake, gimme some more light.
Ready, boys?
Yeah.
Which way, Mr. Lattimer?
South, until we get out of town, then we head north.
Say, where are them three soldiers we're takin'?
They're staying in Hays City, but I'm goin'.
Get on your wagon.
It's dark enough now, Bill.
You oughta head up north.
Hide out in the Black Hills.
That's bad Indian country, but it'll be safer for you than here.
I'm going into town first.
You're crazy, Bill!
I'd be crazier if I didn't do what
I think I ought to.
Bill, open up.
It's me.
Did they hurt you much, Bill?
I'm all right.
I couldn't come till it got dark. I was scared they'd be watchin' me.
I know you don't want to see me, but I gotta tell you somethin', Bill.
Custer's ordered you brought in dead or alive.
The troopers have combed every hidin' down by the river and they're headin' this way.
He's goin'to fiind Lattimer.
Lattimer's gone.
He pulled out with his wagons.
Where?
Nobody knows.
I'll find him.
Of course you will. Someday you're bound to, only don't try to find his trail now.
Just try to save yourself from Custer's men. There's no tellin' what they'll do.
If Lattimer's pulled out with his wagons, those wagons are loaded.
And I know what
I've got to do.
That's a trooper.
Hear his saber?
Get in there, Bill, quick.
You might set the table for three, Mrs. Cody.
Who's there?
Courier from
General Custer.
General Custer's compliments.
You're to report to him right away.
How do you do, ma'am?
Howdy, soldier.
Hi.
What's up?
Custer's been ordered to move against Sitting Bull and the
Sioux up in Big Horn country.
What does General Custer want Will for?
The General doesn't let me in on all his secrets.
Come on, get a move on.
Go ahead.
I'll be right behind you.
Grub's ready. Hustle them dishes. I'm cavin' in all over.
Light out, Bill.
I've got a pack all fixed for you and I brought a horse.
Good-bye, ma'am, and thank you for everything.
Thanks for the coat,
Bill Cody. I'll take good care of it.
Take care of what's inside of it, you old bushwhacker.
Will, what does
General Custer want of you?
Bill. Bill, you ain't fit to ride far.
Why don't you lay up someplace and take care of that arm?
That's what I'll do.
I'll need this arm when I find Lattimer.
Ah, forget it.
You ain't got a chance against Lattimer's men.
Hmm. I've got nothing to lose.
Nothin' but your life!
When you talk like that,
I could bounce a rock off n your bean.
Why don't you try it next time you see me?
When'll that be, Bill?
Where?
Oh, up around
Deadwood someplace.
You can never tell.
I gotta get out of here too after what I done.
Well, I guess this is good-bye, eh, Bill?
Where are you going?
Oh, up around Deadwood someplace, I guess.
I don't give a hoot where I go.
You're well-named.
A child of calamity.
Always gettin' yourself into trouble.
Bill--
Bill, I reckon maybe you don't hate me.
Do you?
Maybe you're just bein' nice to me because you think you won't ever see me again.
Sure. Sure,
I'll see ya again.
This is a big country, and trails cross... sometimes.
Thought these
Big Horn Mountains was full of Indians.
Well, I ain't seen any Indians yet, but I'll swear to Moses there's somethin' followin' us.
Git!
Want your coat back,
Bill?
No. I want some grub.
Well, how do you like your eggs?
I like 'em very much.
You got any?
No.
I got some jerky and a little bacon and a little coffee.
You must've been mighty frugal over the last six weeks since you been gone.
I haven't any grub left.
Well, you're welcome to anything I got, Will.
I know that, Bill.
Build up a little fire and we'll have coffee.
Given up ridin' a horse?
Indians got it.
Mine too.
I see you got holes in your boots.
That's from followin' a long-legged man.
Me?
You.
What were you followin' me for?
Did you have something you wanted to tell me?
I reckon I did.
I thought you were off with Custer.
Custer sent me to bring you back.
Slice up some of that bacon, Bill.
Have a piece of jerky.
Thanks, Bill.
Well, I guess we got a few coffee beans left.
Enough for about two cups if we make it weak.
How's Lou?
I ain't seen her, Bill, for weeks.
She went home to St. Louis the day after you left.
She wanted to be with her mother when--
And what have you decided to call it?
I guess Lou will decide that.
Yeah. She's a fine woman, Bill.
She fixed my arm, so I can pull a gun as quick with my left as I can with my right.
Well, that's fine,
Bill.
It might come in handy for you.
It will.
This is a hostile country.
If you get some water, we'll get this coffee goin' quick.
Can't understand why Custer sent you.
He says I'm the only man you wouldn't kill.
Seems to me Custer's takin' a whole lot for granted.
Well, there it is.
I have an order from the United States Army to bring you back.
So I gather.
Dead or alive.
Which way do you aim to do it?
Alive.
No, Bill.
It's too bad they had to send you. I'm sorry.
But they did, Bill.
Did you hear that?
What's that Indian doing with that Seventh Cavalry stuff?
That flag's shot to pieces.
- Where'd you get that flag?
That's an officer's coat, and there's a bullet hole through it.
Do you understand him?
He says
Custer's dead!
Wiped out with his whole battalion.
He says Yellow Hand's comin' up from the south with his Cheyenne... to join Sitting Bull.
He says there'll be no more white man.
If the Cheyenne reach Sitting Bull, he's right.
Where's the nearest regiment?
Merritt.
He's moving up to join Crook.
You know his line of march?
He's coming up through Deadwood.
Find him.
He says the white man friend is bringing rifles to Sitting Bull.
- That's Lattimer.
To the new village in the canyon.
That's Deadwood.
You go for Merritt and tell him to get between
Sitting Bull and the Cheyenne.
Remember, Bill, you're my prisoner.
I'll see ya in Deadwood.
We'll settle it there.
[''Oh.! Susanna'' On Piano ]
- I seen it myself.
- One nugget?
Yes, sir.!
Twenty-three ounces.
The biggest nugget I seen in Deadwood yet.
Dave, the biggest liar
I've seen in Deadwood yet is you.
I ain't tryin' to sell you the claim.
I'm caught.
Now, Calamity, what did you wanna do that for?
Drinks ain't free, Dave.
If you was a man,
Calamity--
I ain't, so plunk down four bits.
You're a good barkeep,
Calamity, but you're awful ornery.
Hello, Calamity.
Sherry and egg.
Eggs are a dollar apiece.
I said egg and sherry.
You'll get whiskey and egg.
Would you like to try runnin' me out of this town too,Jack?
No, Calamity.
I don't bear you a bit of hard feeling anymore.
Well, that's just fine.
'Cause I bear you a-plenty.
Now, say, Calamity.
You oughta be makin' up to me.
I'm gonna be a big man in this country.
You'll have to grow about a foot, won't ya?
When I get hold of a pile of money-- which I aim to, and soon-- you'll be treatin'me right.
So, you staked a claim?
Nah, not me.
Those fellas are lookin' for gold in the ground.
I aim to find it on top.
If it ain't in the ground, where is it?
I ain't sayin'!
[ In Normal Voice ]
I ain't sayin'.
All I'm sayin' is
I'm gonna be a big man in this Black Hills country.
Yes, sirree, a big man, like Wild Bill Hickok.
Say, whatever become of Bill?
I couldn't tell ya.
For all I know, he may be dead.
[ Whistling ]
The man that killed him must be ridin' high.
The man don't live that could kill him.
Though you done your best.
You told Lattimer, Bill was looking for him in Hays City.
Hickok don't know that, does he? It ain't true.
There ain't a word of truth in it.
Lucky for you
Bill ain't here.
You can throw this old outfit away or burn it.
I don't think they'll burn.
Hey.
You like-a the haircut?
No, no haircut.
Have you seen any freighting or hauling around here?
No, no freighting.
No hauling.
Everybody got a mine.
Everybody dig and a-dig.
Nobody got-a time for Tony no more.
Nobody take a bath no more!
Hey, don't you ever put tobacco in that pipe?
Smells like an octopus.
Hello,Jack.
What's that army horse doin' here?
There ain't been any soldiers around here in weeks,
Mr. Lattimer, but the Fifth Cavalry's comin' in.
We'll be gone before they get in.
My wagons oughta be here in a few minutes.
I need some barberin'.
I ain't seen no Indian guide.
Give him time.
Sitting Bull said he'd send him.
Take it easy.
Mr. Lattimer.
I'm gettin' kinda jumpy about those wagons.
I'll buy ya one.
That's nice of you,
Mr. Lattimer.
A drop of rye will set me up just fine.
You don't happen to have seen any wagons going through... loaded with farming tools?
Now what does anybody want-a with-a farming tools?
They got no time to farm.
Hey. Why don't you want to get the haircut?
Short hair makes the Indians mad, and they're mad enough already.
Thank-a you too much.
He's-a fine fellow.
Bill!
Hello, Calamity.
Ah, Bill.
Gee, you're back.
I been watchin' and askin' and nobody's seen ya.
Nobody's heard.
I haven't been out in what you call society.
I had one caller, though. Bill Cody.
He found you, then.
Say, Bill, you didn't--
No.
No, he's all right.
I'm meetin' him here.
I'm sure glad of that.
Wasn't your fault, them three soldiers gettin' killed.
Say, Bill. You won't have to move on, will ya?
No, I got a hunch this is gonna be my last camp.
You're settlin' down?
You're gonna stay here?
I got a feelin'
I'm gonna stay here.
Bill, you need a drink.
I been thinkin'.
The West is gettin' to be a new kind of place.
Bill Cody's done the right thing.
He's changed.
What room is there gonna be for a two-gun plainsman?
You're talkin' crazy.
You're the best man in this country.
I don't know who thinks so.
I think so, Bill.
If you think Cody done right settlin' down and all, maybe that's what you'd like to do.
I mean, have a home and things... and have somebody to cook your meals for ya and--
Doesn't sound so bad.
Oh, Bill--
Calamity, now you gotta listen to me.
I didn't do nothin',
Mr. Hickok.
- I didn't do nothin'.
- What's he talkin' about?
He sneaked and told Lattimer you was lookin' for him back in Hays City.
She's lying, Mr. Hickok.
She's lying.
McCall, a year ago I'd have shot you dead on sight.
But now--
Go buy yourself a drink.
You're the luckiest rat alive.
I'm beginnin' to think
Mrs. Cody was right.
Who am I to decide whether a man's to live or die?
You feelin' all right, Bill?
No Injun guide yet,Jake.
No? Well, if you don't mind, then I'll go put down a drink.
All right.
Go ahead, boys.
Wet your whistles.
Mr. Lattimer.
Hickok is in town.
Hickok? Where?
In the Bella Union.
Get the boys back, quick.
Hey,Jake!
Mr. Lattimer wants you--
Shut up, you fool!
Lattimer.
Stay in here,
Calamity.
Oh, Bill.
This is the only thing
I have worth keeping.
If you got a wrong hunch, don't go out there.
Don't forget to wind it.
You're a mule-headed man,
Bill Hickok!
Get on your wagons, boys.
Just a minute.!
I wanna talk to you.
Any objections, gentlemen?
Where you goin' with the wagons?
Goin' out of town.
What you got 'em loaded with?
Buffalo hides.
You can see, can't ya?
Your wagons are headed north,
Lattimer.
You're not selling buffalo hides to Sitting Bull's Indians?
Take off the top hides.
I wanna see what's under 'em.
Jake.
NotJake.
You.
Oh. All right.
I don't know what you're lookin' fer, but if you want it, you're gonna get it.
Keep your hands off your guns, or there'll be more dead men than this town can afford to bury.
You gentlemen also sell farming tools?
Get on ahead of me, inside the Bella Union.
Wait a minute.
Don't you belong to this outfit,Jack?
Huh?
Oh, no, Mr. Hickok.
I just know Mr. Lattimer.
You knew
Mr. Lattimer,Jack.
Better get inside too.
Oh, sure.
Sure, Mr. Hickok.
Whatever you say.
- Who was that fella he shot?
- Never saw him before.
He oughta know better than to pull a gun on Bill Hickok.
Cody and the Fifth Cavalry are on their way.
Keep an eye out for 'em.
The rest of you, keep out!
[ Man ]
I'm not going to go in there.
Gentlemen, we're gonna stay right here for a while.
What'll it be?
Name your poison.
Jack, how about tending bar?
We may be here for quite a long wait.
What are we waitin' for?
Jake, don't reach for anything but your glass.
That goes for the rest of you.
Keep your hands away from your guns unless you want... fiive cheap funerals in Deadwood instead of one.
We're waiting till
General Merritt gets here with the Fifth Cavalry... and takes over
Sitting Bull's rifles.
Any objection?
May be an hour, may be a day.
When I have to wait,
I believe in entertainment.
Furthermore,
I'm short of funds.
Cards, bartender.
Find some fresh ones and some chips.
Proceed, gentlemen, over there.
You first, if it's all the same to you.
I'll take the one without arms.
Keep your hands on the table, all of you.
You bank.
I don't hear no shootin'.
It's powerful quiet in there.
Wonder what they're doin'.
Best way to find out is to--
You keep out of this!
Let Bill Hickok play his own hand.
That's-a just what he's a-doin'.
He's a-playin' cards.
Playin' cards?
Tony must be crazy.
- Let's go in and find out.
- No, no.
I see him so plain.
He's a-sittin'down with his back-a this way.
His back?
Cut for deal.
Looks like we're being played for suckers.
Your deal.
Any sign of the cavalry yet, Calamity?
Not yet, Bill.
I hope my prisoner hasn't escaped.
General Merritt, if he's done the job he set out to do, do you think the government would be a little lenient with him?
Mr. Cody, in matters where its sympathies are concerned, the government has been known to bend a little.
- You better not go in there.
- Bill, there's an Injun comin' in the door.
Hello, Charlie.
Come in.
- Charlie's a friendly Injun.
- Yes, I know Charlie.
How many?
Gimme two.
Three to me.
Sit over here, Charlie, where I can keep an eye on you.
Charlie took a shot at me once.
I was too far away.
Too bad you wasn't closer.
He got my horse.
Charlie'd been the biggest man in the West if he'd have killed you, Hickok.
Injuns understand things like that.
Kill a big man and that makes you a big man.
Killin'you, Hickok, is an honorjust waitin' for somebody.
You,Jake?
Not me, Bill, not me.
I'm facing you. Only way to down a man like you is from the back.
Raise ya five.
Seein' that and up five.
Get your foot off my chair,
Calamity. It's bad luck.
Don't go against your luck, Bill.
Your say,Jake.
The soldiers! That means a rope necktie for us!
Sit down!
We'll play out this hand.
- All right.
- This game ain't over yet.
It's almost over.
Calamity, find Cody and General Merritt.
Bring 'em here.
- Play your hand.
- I'm callin'ya, Hickok.!
Black aces and eights.
Your luck's changed.
Three queens.
I'm afraid you lose, Hickok.
A man's bound to lose, sooner or later.
Bill? Bill!
Let's get outta here!
Those fellas just shot
Bill Hickok!
Arrest those men!
Come on, you.
Get up.
Where is he?
Where's Bill?
There's your prisoner,
General Merritt.
We won't forget what Bill Hickok has done, Cody.
We'll remember.
All of us will.
All of us.
That's one kiss you won't wipe off.
Afternoon, Parker.
Good afternoon, sir.
General Faversham is waiting for you on the terrace.
Aye.
Dr. Sutton, sir.
You've had a long journey, Doctor.
Oh, it's worth a journey to join old comrades.
- Are they all coming?
- Same crowd.
- A year older.
- Ah.
- Sit down. Help yourself.
- Thank you.
Well, what's the news from London?
Well, haven't you heard?
Gordon's dead.
Murdered in Khartoum.
That's no news to me.
I said that was going to happen years ago when they first sent Gordon to Egypt.
He wasn't hard enough.
They wanted someone like you out there.
Just what I was going to say myself.
First time for a hundred years there hasn't been a Faversham in the army... and look at the mess they make.
I'm too old, the boy's too young.
Me own fault for not marrying sooner.
You remember the boy.
He's 15 years old today.
I'm going to let him dine with us tonight.
- Oh, good.
- I don't mind telling you, I'm worried about him.
- Oh?
- I can't understand the boy.
I send him to the best army school in England... spend half me time telling him about his famous ancestors... and what do you think?
I found him this morning reading a poetry book!
Shelley, of all people!
So I want you to help me lick this boy into shape and make him hard.
Gentlemen, to Crimea!
- Ah.
- Old comrades.
Old comrades!
- Arnold!
- Raglan!
Yes.
Crimea, by Jove.
Ah, war was war in those days and men were men.
No room for weaklings.
Balaclava, for instance.
Here. You fellows remember the positions.
Now here, these nuts... were the Russians.
Guns, guns, guns.
On the right, the British infantry.
The thin red line.
There was the commander in chief.
And here was I... at the head of the old 68th.
The right was impossible.
The left was blocked.
Behind us was the commander in chief.
I realized the position in a flash.
I said, "The 68th will move forward. "
Immediately one of my subalterns came to me shaking.
Absolutely shaking!
I said, "What's wrong, Travers?"
Said, "I'm afraid to face those guns, sir. "
I said, "Would you rather face me?"
Hmph! He took one look at my face and off he went.
Ten minutes later he was shot to pieces at the head of his men.
As a soldier should be, eh?
I quite agree with you, General.
I can tolerate nerves before a battle, but I can't stand cowardice.
I remember a soldier at Inkerman when a Cossack charged down on him.
I saw a man raise his musket, fumble with his trigger, then turn and run.
The Cossack's lance went in at the back of his neck... and came out in his throat.
Best thing that could have happened to him.
Do you remember Wilmington?
- Wilmington?
- Fine old service family.
Father killed at Inkerman... grandfather blown up under Nelson and an uncle scalped by Indians.
Oh, splendid record. Splendid.
What happened?
Well, the general ordered him to gallop through the lines with a message.
Paralyzed with funk.
Couldn't move.
General sent his adjutant.
Killed before he'd gone 50 yards.
Sent his A.D.C.- head blown off.
Then he went through with the message himself- lost his arm.
- Ruined his cricket.
- Oh, yes, I remember now.
He disgraced his family.
His father disowned him.
Hung about for a year or two, then blew his brains out.
Ah, he had the courage to blow his brains out.
Courage?
Last spark of decency, that's all.
There's no place in England for a coward.
Harry.
Past 11:00.
Time you were in your bed.
No, no, no.
Sit you down, my boy. Sit you down.
It's the boy's birthday, and we've not drunk his health!
- Go ahead, General.
- A toast to Harry!
And may he prove the bravest of the Favershams.
- To Harry!
- Harry!
- Thank you.
- That's our boy.
- Good night, Father.
- Good night, Harry.
Good night, gentlemen.
- Fine boy.
- Yes.
Harry.
You don't remember me.
I remember you though, when you were about so long.
I was a doctor in your father's regiment in the Crimea.
I knew your mother too, Harry.
She was my friend.
I'd like you to think of me as your friend too.
If ever you should need me, here's my card.
I'm not much use to anybody nowadays, but if ever you feel the need, write to me.
Come and see me.
That's very kind of you, sir.
Thank you.
- Good night, sir.
- Good night, Harry.
Sections... left!
Wheel!
Stand at ease!
Ten years ago...
General Gordon was murdered in Khartoum... and the British army was withdrawn into Egypt... without punishing the crime.
Today the Royal North Surrey Regiment... is under orders to join
Sir Herbert Kitchener's Anglo-Egyptian army... for the reconquest of the Sudan!
Hip-hip-hooray!
- Ooh, hello.
- Well, what's Egypt like, John?
Principally, sand, sweat and sunstroke.
- Ooh, lovely! When do we start?
- Can't say.
- Not before next Thursday.
- Heavens no.
Took them 10 years to make up their minds.
- We'll be lucky if we start in a month.
- Splendid. Then I can give you these.
Mr. Harry Faversham,
Captain John Durrance... and one for Fat Face Willoughby.
- Ooh, what's all this?
- An invitation to the Burroughs family bean feast.
Complete with regimental string band, strawberry ices... and a performing troupe of hired waiters.
Yes, my sister's coming of age.
Ethne is 21 next Thursday, so Father is letting himself go.
- Champagne?
- Gallons!
- Oysters?
- Oysters in June? Don't be a fool.
I had 'em at my coming out.
I had the sense to be born in March.
Father's going to be terrific.
He's given four speeches already, and he's been rehearsing them in the bathroom.
"My lords, ladies and gentlemen and officers of my old regiment... this is an occasion for double rejoicing.
I am proud to announce not only my daughter's coming of age... but also her engagement to the son of my old comrade in arms...
Mr. Harry Faversham of the Royal North Surrey Regiment. "
What, him?
- Our own Harry Faversham.
- Oh, I say, this is very sudden.
They've been signaling for it for months.
- Good luck, Harry.
- Thanks.
Good luck, Harry.
Thanks, John.
What about this Egypt business?
You can't take her with you, you know.
When the Dervishes catch a white man, they cut his nose off... and hang him up by the toes.
Ooh, disgusting business.
All the money falling out of your pockets.
I'll see you at dinner.
Ooh.
Did I frighten the poor lad?
Shouldn't be surprised.
I don't know what's come over the lad.
Can't take a joke.
Never takes a drink.
Moons about all day.
Reads poetry all night.
If that's love, give me indigestion.
Oh. Uh, time to get changed.
- So long.
- So long.
I'm sorry, John. I was a fool to make a joke of it like that.
- I know how you feel about her.
- That's all right, Peter.
It was for her to decide.
I wish it had been you, all the same.
See you at mess.
After all, there are plenty of other girls.
Plenty?
For other men.
Um, uh, many years ago...
I fought in the Crimea... beside that very gallant soldier
General Faversham... whose death last year was, uh, such a loss to us.
Hear! Hear!
Tonight I am proud to announce the engagement of my daughter... to Harry Faversham... my dear old friend's only son.
Bravo!
- Good old Harry!
- Good luck, Harry!
Ten years ago, when Harry was a boy...
I raised my glass in his honor... with the toast, "May he prove the bravest of all the Favershams. "
Harry Faversham... coupled with the name of my daughter Ethne.
Harry!
- Good luck!
- Good luck, Harry.
The company is now dismissed.
The business of dancing will now commence.
Well, Colonel, you're off on this Egyptian affair, eh?
Of course it's only a minor campaign.
It'll do you a world of good.
The army's too soft nowadays.
- You mean not hard enough?
- Of course!
Now, the Crimea - Ah!
War was war in those days... and men were men.
Let me tell you what happened at Balaclava.
Uh, you remember the positions,
Doctor, don't you?
Only too well.
I was over there, on the extreme left.
Here were the Russian batteries, behind the nuts.
Guns, guns, guns, guns.
On the right, the British infantry.
The thin red line.
I suppose they didn't get much to eat.
- What are you talking about?
- Well, sir, you said they were so - so thin.
Bah! The line, I meant!
- Not the men.
- Oh.
Right here was the commander in chief.
And here was I... at the head of the old 68th.
- Sorry Father had to drag Egypt into it.
- Tired of Egypt already?
We have it for breakfast and lunch... and the honor of the regiment for supper.
I suppose he quite understands you're marrying me and not the regiment.
He's not quite sure about that.
Are you... quite sure?
When we are old and creaky with rheumatism... we shall look back and think of this night.
Ethne, you'll never creak.
Never in your life.
We shall creak with the best of them.
And through the creaks will come the sound of this dance music... and the light of the moon and the scent of the flowers.
This is a solemn occasion, Harry.
A memory is being born tonight... a memory that shall stand the test of all the years.
Moments like this are better than all the memories in the world.
The memories will be the best... because they'll be right out of reach of uncertainty and care.
Memories just float about on their own with no shadows upon them.
The dance music, the moon and evening primroses. That's all.
You're not going to rob me of my solitary dance, Ethne.
John, I'm so sorry. It's my fault.
Is this your dance going on?
- It's just started.
- Oh, dear. There's a partner waiting for me.
Excuse me.
It wasn't his fault, John.
It was mine. I talk too much.
- Shall we dance?
- It's a polka.
- Don't you like a polka?
- A bit jerky, isn't it?
Rather like saying "good-bye" in Morse code.
- I'm sorry, John.
- There's no need to be sorry.
- It's terribly hard to explain.
- There's nothing to explain.
You don't expect a girl to sit down and write out a catalog - points why I love Mr. "A," points why I don't love Mr. "B."
It's only Mr. "B" who sits down and puzzles out the points against him.
I never saw such an impressive list.
Reasons why Ethne Burroughs doesn't love John Durrance.
- Reason one -
- Don't, John.
Oh, I put down about 40 reasons altogether.
Reason 41 was, she loves the other man.
So I crossed the rest out.
- Thank you.
- Harry's a fine fellow.
Were you to help him, he shall have a splendid career.
- You'll enjoy helping him, won't you?
- I hope I shall be able to.
You will.
I think you'll be very happy.
And I think I shall always love you.
Oh, John, dear.
I'm so sorry.
Oh, rubbish.
I shall be all right.
You're not going to be sorry for anything tonight.
Come and dance that polka. I've just learnt it.
- Faversham.
- See what he wants, Lubbock.
He wants to see you privately, sir.
Oh, very well.
Well, Faversham?
I want you to accept this, sir.
- What is it?
- I am resigning my commission.
Resigning your commission?
- What do you mean?
- I mean just that, sir.
I don't understand you, Faversham.
I should have taken this action months ago.
I only accepted a commission for my father's sake... because all his family have been soldiers.
But when he died, my duty towards him was done.
Your duty towards him?
Have you no duty towards your country?
Oh, go lie down in a dark room, my boy.
You'll be all right in the morning.
I've made up my mind, sir.
Faversham, if you do this... you will regret it for the rest of your life.
I'm sorry, sir.
I've made up my mind.
You're deliberately shirking your duty, sir!
I refuse to accept your resignation!
I am within my rights to resign, sir.
You cannot refuse.
I never thought I should live to see a Faversham play the coward.
- May I go, sir?
- Yes.
Go.
- The officers -
- Well?
Are waiting, sir.
Whew!
Gentlemen, final orders have just arrived.
The regiment leaves on Thursday.
We march to Portsmouth and embark at midday.
I, uh - I've just received this telegram from General Kitchener.
"Glad to welcome your regiment to my command. "
- Well, that's very nice of him, isn't it?
- Gentlemen.
There will be one change in regimental orders for the 15th.
Mr. Faversham has seen fit to send in his papers... on the eve of his regiment sailing for active service.
His place will be taken by Mr. Parker, who was to have remained at the depot.
- Well done, Parker!
- Glad you're coming with us!
- Ohh!
- Look out, sir!
- Well, I must be off.
- Good-bye, John.
- Good-bye.
- Good luck to you.
- And keep an eye on young Peter for me.
- I will, sir. Both eyes.
There's a lovey dove!
What's she crying for?
There.
Well, good-bye, Aggie.
Take care of your ma.
- Bye.
- Good-bye, lovey.
Don't take on now.
I'm all right.
The kids are going to miss you.
- Good-bye, my boy.
- Good-bye, Father.
Good-bye.
- The dogs are going to miss you.
- Yes, sir!
# Should auld acquaintance be forgot #
# In the days of auld lang syne #
# For auld lang syne, my dear #
# For auld lang syne #
# We'll take a cup of kindness yet #
# For the days of auld lang syne ##
Harry!
What's happened? Peter left last night.
Father went with him to see you all off.
They've canceled it.
You're not going after all?
They've gone.
The regiment sailed this morning.
- But I haven't gone with them.
- I don't understand.
We've discussed it so often - the futility of this idiotic
Egyptian adventure... the madness of it all... the ghastly waste of time that we can never have again.
- What have you done, Harry?
- I've resigned my commission.
I should have done it sooner.
Long ago.
It's released me from the life of an impostor.
That's all a man is when he fails to be true to the things he believes in.
I believe in our happiness.
I believe in the work to be done here to save an estate that's near to ruin... to save all those people who've been neglected by my family... because they preferred glory in India, glory in China, glory in Africa.
Oh, excuse me, miss.
This package has just arrived for Mr. Faversham addressed in your care... and marked urgent, miss.
Thank you.
"Mr. Thomas Willoughby. "
"Mr. Peter Burroughs. "
"Captain John Durrance. "
Well, they had a fine send-off, Ethne.
I went aboard and had lunch with them before they sailed.
Peter has a cabin with John Durrance and Willoughby.
I'm glad the three boys are going to be together.
- Father, I -
- Yes.
It was a wonderful sight, the vessel steaming out into the channel... and all those men cheering and -
May I speak to you a moment, sir?
It was cruel to send these.
Cruel, but just.
That's what you think, isn't it?
You needn't tell me, Ethne.
I can see it quite clearly in your eyes.
We agreed always to be honest with each other, Harry... to keep no secret from each other.
When you did this... did you believe that I should be proud of you?
I thought you'd understand.
We've so often talked of these things and we've always understood each other.
I know, Harry. We've talked and we've dreamed of things we'd do if we were free.
Some people are born free. They can do what they like without concern for consequences.
But you were not born free, Harry, and nor was I.
We were born into a tradition... a code which we must obey even if we do not believe.
And we must obey it, Harry... because the pride and happiness of everyone surrounding us depends upon our obedience.
I quite understand.
There should be four feathers here.
We agreed always to be honest with each other.
Give it to me.
Come on!
Brigade!
Attention!
Shoulder arms!
Present arms!
Shoulder arms!
- You've served here before.
- Abu Klea, sir.
Then you know what to expect.
- You too?
- I've been out here ever since, sir.
- You married?
- Yes, sir.
- Children?
- Four, sir.
When I left home.
- Harry Faversham.
- Hello, Doctor.
Why, what's happened?
I thought your regiment had gone.
Oh, yes, they've gone, like the guards have gone tonight.
Years ago, Harry, I gave you my card.
Do you remember?
Yes, Doctor, I remember.
In case you ever needed any help.
Come along. We'll have a quiet supper at my club.
It's just across the park.
The Naval and Military.
No, not there, if you don't mind, Doctor.
- Let's go to my rooms.
- Very well.
You tell me you left the army... because your duty to your home... was greater than your duty towards a crowd of African peasants?
Well, there's nothing dishonorable in that, Harry.
If that's all, if that's the whole truth... then these feathers are an insult to be treated with the contempt they deserve.
If that were all, I should have put them on the fire and you would have never seen them.
But you know that it's not all.
Just as Ethne knew.
I was told a ghastly story when I was a boy, and you were there when it was told.
An officer who failed to carry a message because he was paralyzed with fear.
An officer disgraced and hounded out of society... who shot himself in a back room off the Haymarket because his life was ruined.
That story haunted me.
Many a man is haunted by some fear.
With me it was more than fear.
My father despised me.
He believed me to be a coward.
His belief turned fear into reality.
I knew that if ever fate put me in the same position,
I should behave like that man... and meet the same end.
I am a coward, Doctor.
If I'd been anything but a soldier, I might have lived my whole life and concealed it.
But to be a soldier and a coward is to be an impostor... a menace to the men whose lives are in your hands.
When orders came for Egypt...
I knew that fate was closing in round me... just as it closed round that other man.
I fought against it.
I believed in all the reasons I gave for shirking my job.
I deceived myself.
But I didn't deceive my friends.
The men who sent me these feathers knew me better than I knew myself.
The man who tries to cheat his fate is more than a coward. He's a fool as well.
You're wrong there, Harry.
I never met a fool who had the imagination to be a coward.
If I thought you were a coward, Harry...
I should take this with me... fight you for it if necessary.
It's because I know you've no intention of using it on yourself... that I leave it here.
Harry, is there anything I can do?
Yes, Doctor, there is something you can do.
Yes?
I shall be leaving England tomorrow.
I shall write to you from time to time... just to tell you that I'm alive.
If you don't hear from me for a year... you'll know that I'm dead.
If that happens,
I should like you to go to Ethne... and tell her that at least I tried to put right... the shame and humiliation that I caused her.
Can you tell me where you're going?
Egypt.
- Dr. Harraz?
- Yes?
I've come from England, from an old friend of yours - Dr. Sutton.
Dr. Sutton! I remember him.
I served with him in a hospital in India.
- How is he?
- He's well. He sends you his greeting.
What may I do for you?
I have a mission to reach the army of General Kitchener.
I want your help to disguise me as a native.
- You speak Arabic?
- No.
- You have some native tongue?
- No.
But the army of General Kitchener is 400 miles away... across country in the hands of the enemies.
How then can a doctor help you, except to certify you as mad?
I'm told there is a native tribe called the Sangali... that once revolted against the Khalifa.
And in revenge the Khalifa branded them, cut out their tongues from their heads... and made them outcasts.
- You know the brand?
- All men know the brand of the Sangali.
Then you understand the reason of my visit, Doctor.
But, my dear young man, you will miss your tongue in many ways.
I will keep my tongue.
No one will look for it if I'm branded.
I can stain your skin... but I cannot imitate a scar that would escape detection.
That I understand.
Is your mission then of such importance?
May I stay in your house until the wound is healed?
You are a brave man.
Ah, Durrance.
- Told to report, sir.
- Kitchener's been talking to me.
You know what the situation is.
The main army and provision ships must get up the Nile.
It's the only feasible route up country towards Omdurman.
But the river's blocked by the Khalifa's army... and our ships can't get through the gorge.
Now, the Khalifa must be drawn away, by some sort of bluff, into the desert.
Yes, sir.
Now, if one of our brigades appeared on his flank... he'd have to turn away and face it.
- That would leave the river unguarded.
- Yes, sir.
Now, General Kitchener can't spare a regiment, much less a brigade... but he can spare a company.
Number Five Company of the Royal North Surreys.
Thank you, sir.
Number one section, by the left!
Quick march!
Number two section, by the left!
Quick march!
Number three section, by the left!
Quick march!
Number four section, by the left!
Quick march!
Left, right, left.
Who is this man?
How much did he overhear?
Sangali.
That was a very bad performance,
Mr. Faversham.
No true Sangali would enter a room with the self-assurance of an Englishman.
- Why was that fellow in such a funk?
- He was terrified you might betray him.
- Oh, I see.
- But for myself I have no such fears.
But I must admit I should feel a little more comfortable... if you would tell me frankly why all this - the wandering, the disguise.
In England four people gave me a white feather apiece.
- They've got to take them back.
- Oh, a mad race, the English.
No, not so mad.
In England, the white feather is the mark of a coward.
Ah, I see. Then why worry?
Be a coward and be happy.
No, Doctor.
I have been a coward, and I wasn't happy.
Tell me, did he bring any news?
Yes. He says a North Surrey regiment has left Abu Hamid.
By crossing the desert you could pick them up at the Nile... perhaps near the 5th Cataract.
Part of Kitchener's army is going up the river in boats.
They will be hauled up the cataract by native labor.
There is your chance.
- All right, Sergeant?
- All correct, sir.
We've rigged up enough scarecrows to look like the entire blooming army!
That ought to draw them, all right.
The men can rest, but be ready to move without delay.
The moment we're spotted we won't have time to sit about and admire the view.
- No, sir.
- Take the men back to the camp.
- You watch from that jebel over there.
- Very good, sir.
Your watch.
No Fuzzies round here.
- I'm gonna have a word with the captain.
- Right, Sarge.
Blimey!
- Two men!
- Clark! On the double!
You get the rifles.
Come on. Give me a hand.
Didn't we ought to start him back to camp at once?
His orders were to stay here till we seen Dervishes, and we ain't seen none.
It's ice we want to clap on the back of his neck.
Yes, and a couple of saucy nurses to clap it on for him.
- Can you see anything?
- No.
I can't make it out.
He said he'd be back by dawn at the latest.
Well, perhaps he's spotted a covey of Dervishes and wants to keep an eye on them.
No. If he'd spotted any Dervishes, he'd be back in no time.
Kitchener?
Who's there?
Corporal Evans, sir.
How long have I been lying here?
Since this time yesterday, sir.
- What's the time now?
- About 3:00, sir.
Call Sergeant Brown the moment it's daylight.
But - But it's light now, sir.
- It's afternoon.
- Huh?
What?
- Call Sergeant Brown.
- Yes, sir.
- Sergeant Brown!
- What is it?
- Captain wants you.
- All right.
- Sergeant Brown here, sir.
- Come in, come in.
Glad to see you're better, sir.
No sign of Dervishes yet.
Yes. Now strike the camp immediately.
I spotted Dervish yesterday.
- There's not one moment to lose.
- Very good, sir.
Corporal Clark, call in your men!
Hughes, fetch the captain's horse!
Come on! On the double then!
All right, fall in! Fall in!
Come on, men! Fall in! Come along.
Come on then.
Ready to march off, sir!
Sergeant, come here.
Don't - Don't go away. I -
I want you to - to help me to my horse.
Oh, very good, sir.
Attention!
Flower and Bardell, strike the tent.
Put it on the mule and follow us behind.
Section at ease! Quick march!
- Take me right up to my tent.
- Very good, sir.
Glad to see you back, sir.
We were getting a little worried.
Ah, need to worry.
I spotted some Dervish yesterday.
That's why I stayed up there - to keep watch.
They saw us, all right, so that's half our work done.
Sergeant, give the men some food and see they get to sleep immediately.
Very good, sir.
- Willoughby?
- Yes, sir?
- Parker?
- Yes, sir?
Put those fires out, will you.
Double the sentries round here.
There's no immediate danger, but we've got to keep on the alert from now on.
- Yes, sir.
- Right. Put your fire out.
Oi, Bill, give us a hand with this fire?
Simper, Curtis, Gamble, bring your equipment round.
Good night, boys.
- Peter?
- Yes, John?
I got a touch of the sun out there yesterday.
Hard luck, old boy.
I know what it is.
- I had sunstroke when I was a kid at school.
- Oh? H-How did it affect you?
- Well, it gave me a devil of a headache.
- Oh.
You look a bit done-in, John.
You ought to take a good rest.
Yes. Now listen, Peter.
We're not in a healthy spot here.
Things may be a good deal worse before we're through.
I'm feeling a bit groggy.
I'm going in to rest now.
- Will you look after things for me here tonight?
- Yes, of course.
- Shall I help you in?
- No, no, no. I'll be all right in the morning.
- Seen anything?
- No, sir.
- Well, keep your eyes open.
- Very good, sir.
The mules are restless, sir.
Bad sign.
Yes, I know.
I shall be glad when the sun rises.
Yes, sir.
Alarm!
Alarm!
Bugler, alarm!
Alarm! Alarm!
Alarm!
Load! Present! Fire!
Fire!
Load. Present. Fire!
Present. Fire!
Load. Fire!
- Peter, where are you?
- Here, John.
Are they all around us?
I can't see in this smoke.
Load. Present. Fire!
Present! Fire!
Load. Present. Fire!
Load.
Fire!
- Sir.
- Yes?
- Ali has news, sir.
- Good. What does he know?
What?
Well, the Khalifa's left the Nile with his whole army.
Fine. That's the news we're waiting for.
Madsen, give orders to sail at once.
Now, this is grand.
We'll soon be up to Omdurman... and Kitchener can have his battle where he wants it.
Ah, thanks to Durrance.
He's done a magnificent job.
Peter?
Is that you, Peter?
Peter.
Peter?
Peter!
Peter!
Willoughby?
Burroughs!
Peter!
For God's sake, answer me!
Oh, is that you, Peter?
I'm blasted near mad.
I - I can't see, Peter.
It's no good pretending anymore.
I can't see. I - I'm blind.
The sun got me out there in the mountains.
Why don't you speak?
What's the matter?
Who are you?
What, are you all dumb?
Have you never seen a blind man before?
Who the devil are you? Speak!
If you can't speak English, speak Arabic, but speak! Speak!
Or it's true then.
They're all dead.
All my company wiped out.
Nothing but a blind man and a dumb lunatic.
There's nothing left but death from thirst.
Come here.
Come here.
Lean your head against the one cool thing... left in this blasted furnace.
You won't? All right.
Well, go to the devil alone.
Give it! Give it to me!
Give it to me!
I'll kill you! Let go.
Alarm! Alarm!
Company, stand to!
Company, fall in!
Load! Present! Fire!
Fire! Load! Present!
Fire! Fire!
Load! Present!
Give me my helmet, Sergeant, will you?
Ethne.
Don't you like the polka?
A bit jerky, isn't it?
Ethne, I shall love you always.
Hello, Doctor.
I'm glad to find you alone, Ethne.
- I really came here to talk to you.
- Well, Doctor?
I want to know if you've heard from Harry Faversham.
I've heard nothing.
It was his own wish and my wish that the break should be complete.
I've no idea where he is or what he's doing.
I promised to give you a message when I saw him on the night before he left England... a year ago.
A year ago?
Then -
I don't understand, Doctor.
He left England for one purpose only.
If he succeeded, he said that you would learn by means... that would need no explanation.
If he failed, then he asked me to let you know... that at least he'd done his best.
I see.
He promised to write to me now and then just to show that he was still alive.
If I heard nothing for a year... then his silence would show that he was dead.
My dear.
So that's the end.
You think I behaved brutally to him,
Doctor.
No.
I did behave brutally.
I behaved like the worst kind of coward.
I failed to help him when he was so terribly in need of help.
Nothing that you could have done would have made him alter his decision.
I could have helped him.
If you'd gone on your knees, you could have done nothing.
His mind was made up.
You must always remember that, Ethne... for the sake of his memory and for your own happiness.
Oh. Ethne!
What are you two mooching about outside for?
Just having a dose of your country air, General.
It'll be a dose of bronchitis if you don't take care.
Come on in, Ethne.
Give us some sherry.
Look, there's an Arab!
He's got an officer.
- Blimey! He's trying to rob him.
- Come on. Let's get him.
Abdul, ask him what he has to say.
It is useless, Your Excellency.
He's one of the Sangali tribe.
He cannot speak.
Put him with those two horse thieves we got yesterday... and send him to Abu Hamid to mend the roads.
- March him out, Sergeant.
- Sir.
The doctor, sir.
- Well, Doctor, how's Durrance?
- He'll pull through.
Splendid. He's a fine officer.
The regiment can't spare a man like that.
He's blind.
Blind?
Sunstroke- exposure of the eyes to the sun.
I've seen it before, Colonel.
A man alone bowled over suddenly lies there exposed.
But with rest and care, he'll get better?
With immediate attention, there might have been a chance in a hundred.
Now there's none.
The nerves are completely destroyed.
Up!
- Good work, boy. Good work. Good work.
- Bravo!
Ha-ha! You'll have me riding to hounds in a couple of weeks.
- Up another six inches, Joe.
- No more today.
Just one more.
Just a tiny little bit more.
Tomorrow, John.
It's time to dress for dinner.
Dress? I can dress in 10 minutes now.
Knocked two minutes off my record this morning.
There's your shaving lesson before dinner too, sir.
Aha! Yes, my shaving lesson.
Also my lesson in making bow ties.
Lots of fun in going back to school again, Ethne.
Joe's a great teacher.
Ought to be a professor.
Easy with a good pupil, sir.
And no more of those infernal chopped-up meals.
I'm feeling like a lesson in carving roast chicken tonight.
I'll see you at dinner.
Come on, Joe.
Thank you.
Brave man.
I hope I can make him very happy.
All right, Joe.
You do it for me, will you?
Look here, Ethne. I -
I've been wanting to say something to you for a long time.
Beastly difficult to know how to put it.
Of course, it's no business of mine... but are you sure you're right in what you're doing?
Quite sure.
You know, a man becomes a soldier with all the knowledge of the risks ahead of him.
If misfortune comes, it's all part of the game.
He doesn't ask for any pity or sympathy.
But you've got your whole life before you.
I know it's a noble, unselfish impulse... but for 30 or 40 years - maybe 50 years -
Father, please don't talk about being noble.
There's nothing like that about it.
It's just -
Well, it's just that
I've made up my mind.
Yes. The Arab is a strange, unexpected creature.
Yes, yes. Wait a minute.
You haven't heard the end yet.
Here's a solitary Arab. Heaven knows where he comes from or how he's alive.
He packs my map, slings my water bottle round my neck... and never says a word from beginning to end.
- That must have been uncanny.
- Uncanny?
It nearly drove me mad.
Yet I knew all the time he was trying to save me.
How many days we traveled
I shall never know.
I was crazy with fever.
Must have been the best part of a week.
He gets me in a boat, floats me down the Nile... till he comes within sight of the camp, and then -
Now, here's the extraordinary part.
Having done enough to win the Victoria Cross... he lays me down outside the camp and calmly begins to rob me.
Nothing strange in that.
Just Eastern business mentality.
He'd done a job of work and was taking payment.
Poor devil got less than he bargained for.
I carried no papers on active service and no money.
Huh. He got nothing then.
He nearly got one thing - the only thing I was carrying.
- Remember this?
- It's my letter.
Your letter.
There's a funny thing in this letter.
Ethne, read - read the postscript you wrote.
It's still got some sand in it.
- You can keep the sand as a souvenir.
- Thank you -
- Go on. Read the postscript.
- Let me read it.
"PS: Take care not to get sunstroke. "
You always said I knew too much to take advice.
Ethne, darling, I'm sorry.
You're trembling.
You mustn't take it like that.
It's all over now.
It might have been a lot worse.
I'd have been dead six months ago if it hadn't been for my little Arab friend.
And what happened to your little Arab friend?
I wish I knew.
They sent the poor devil to a convict gang.
When I came to my senses, it was too late to find him.
He'd escaped.
I was never able to trace him.
Now for a turn in the garden.
Stay here.
I'll get my coat and fetch yours, Ethne.
Oh. My letter.
Thank you.
So Harry's alive... or was when he paid that debt.
Oi, Peter.
Good of them to entertain us for nothing.
If I had my hands free, I'd applaud.
If I had my hands free for 10 seconds...
I'd strangle that filthy little blighter with the monkey.
Get out, you -
Willoughby. Do I still look sane?
No. Do I?
"Don't despair. "
Peter.
Perhaps our message got through.
Perhaps Durrance did get away and sent this fellow... to give us some hope of escape from this hell.
Escape? I wonder.
I wonder what his plan is.
Karaga.
Karaga Pasha.
Tell me, which do you think would give the better chance of escape - the desert or the river?
How should I know?
Nobody has ever escaped from here.
But surely some attempts must have been made to free you.
Yes, years and years ago... but they all failed.
How long have you been here?
- Since Gordon was killed.
- Thirteen years.
Swim.
- Swim?
- Yes?
See island.
Tomorrow. Boat waiting.
So, the mad musician of Omdurman was a British spy.
What message did you give to your British friends?
The Khalifa will reward and spare you if you will do his bidding.
What do you know of Kitchener's army?
If you won't answer, we'll flog you until you do.
Answer!
- There you are.
- Thank heavens for that.
Well, that's the end of that.
No pork for dinner.
Poor devil. They've flogged him.
I wonder who he is.
Looks like an Arab.
Probably paid by our people to help us.
I wonder if he's got any papers on him.
Spies don't usually carry papers about.
Well, I made a nice mess of that, didn't I?
- Faversham!
- Harry, how the devil did you get here?
- Who sent you?
- Nobody.
Then what you - what you doing here?
- For heaven's sake, explain, Harry.
- There's no time to explain now.
We're in an infernal mess, but there's still a chance. Now listen to me.
The Khalifa has gone out to meet Kitchener.
If he gets beaten, he'll slit our throats in revenge.
If he wins, he'll slit 'em out of pure joy.
Right opposite the prison gates is the arsenal of the Khalifa.
That's our one chance. Just a couple of guards and a few storekeepers, and that's about all.
- Have you got that file?
- Yes. That file was an absolute brain wave.
We must work like blazes.
Now, is there anybody here who understands the language of these poor devils?
Yes. That old fellow over there.
I'll go and fetch him.
Are you all right, Harry?
I'm all right, Fat Face.
Harry. This is Karaga Pasha... once governor of the province of Kordofan.
You speak English and the language of these people?
I speak Arabic and Greek.
They all understand one or the other.
Then you can do a great service to yourself and to all these people.
Will you tell them that I have brought the means of setting them free?
Tell them that once they are freed, on no account... must they make a sign or a movement until they get the word from me.
We must work very fast.
Tom, break that file in two.
Bring me the strongest man first.
Fix!
Fix!
- Bayonets!
- Bayonets.
They're deploying to attack, sir.
It's their whole army.
Perkins, go to the right.
Cramley, go to the left.
Tell the brigade to take up their position.
Tell them to withhold their fire until the last possible moment.
Front wing! Kneel!
Hold!
Grand sight, ain't it?
- Getting 'orrible close. When do we fire?
- When we're told.
Stick it, lad.
If you can't look at 'em coming on, shut your eyes.
I'll nudge ya when to open 'em.
Present!
Fire!
Get your chains on.
Karaga, tell them it's now or never.
Tell them they mustn't move an inch until the guards reach us.
They're rallying again, sir.
- There aren't so many of them now.
- Nor of us, sir.
Lengthen range 350. We'll have that tower down with the black flag on it.
- That's the arsenal, sir.
- Good! Then we'll blow it up.
Lengthen range 350!
- That's not a Dervish gun. That's our gun.
- They'll blow us to pieces!
Wait here.
They're firing at the black flag.
We must get it down, put something else up instead.
Anything! This'll do.
Harry. Look here!
It's the one they took from us.
- All right. I'll take it.
- All right.
They're lowering the flag, surrendering.
Hauling up a white one.
- It isn't white, sir. It's ours.
- What?
Paper! Paper!
Khartoum recaptured by Kitchener!
Paper! Paper!
Khartoum recaptured! Paper!
Paper! Paper! Paper!
Come in.
- Hello, John.
- Hello, Doctor.
How are you?
Have a drink.
On the table there.
- Do you mind if I light the gas?
- Sorry, old man.
Meant to have done it before you came.
No, no. Give me the matches. I'll light it.
- Have you heard the news?
- I've been listening.
Is it true? We've got Khartoum?
It's just come through. Kitchener broke the Dervishes's army at Omdurman.
Good. Good. Splendid.
Well, that's that.
Sit down, Doctor.
- Whiskey?
- Not just now, John.
You've seen Dr. Wesley?
I've just left him.
Heine, the German specialist, was there too.
Nice fellow, that German.
Took a lot of trouble.
You needn't tell me the verdict, Doctor.
I quite understand.
I think it's what you expected, John.
He doesn't feel that an operation -
Neither did I.
A man gets to understand these things.
If there had been any sort of spark left inside that could be fanned up again...
I'm certain
I should have felt it there.
I've known for some time that they were... stone dead.
Heine explained that the trouble sometimes comes... from a lesion that can be repaired by operation.
- In your case -
- In my case, it's a complete blackout.
No harm in getting the best man anyway.
- You earned your whiskey now, Doctor.
- Thanks.
Might have been a lot worse.
If I had known from the start it was hopeless...
I'd probably have blown my brains out.
Today it isn't half so bad.
I've been learning to read this Braille stuff.
- Yeah?
- Funny how quickly the fingers get sensitive.
Listen.
"Be not afeard. The isle is full of noises, sounds and sweet airs... that give delight and hurt not.
Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments will hum about mine ears... and sometimes voices... but if I then had waked after a long sleep... will make me sleep again; and then, in dreaming... the clouds methought would open, and show riches ready to drop upon me... that, when I waked...
I cried to sleep again. "
- Splendid.
- Marvelous, isn't it?
I knew that bit by heart anyway.
- Here - Here's to your health, Doctor.
- Well, here's to you, John.
To Kitchener and his bright lads in Khartoum.
Now, stretch out your legs and read the news.
There's a report by Mallinson, the war correspondent.
- "Khartoum, second September. "
- Good. Good. Now, do read it.
"From the shadow of Gordon's palace,
I am proud to send news... of a glorious victory.
At dawn this morning, after a wild night of storm and rain... scouts reported that the Dervish army was massing to give battle... upon the hills above Kerreri. "
That's where the legend said the British would be destroyed.
Now, if the Dervish had ignored that silly rot and fought -
- Oh, shut up and listen.
- Sorry.
"At 6:00 the Dervish army advanced en masse... and flung themselves with fanatical bravery upon the British square.
Within two hours the Dervish forces were broken and in flight.
A full report upon the fighting at Kerreri will be sent... when details are available... but your correspondent, who accompanied the Royal North Surrey Regiment" -
Good old Surreys.
"... was privileged to witness the most dramatic and astonishing scene in this inspiring day. "
Hmm.
"During the battle, the prisoners in the Omdurman dungeons... overwhelmed their guards, captured the arsenal and held it...
- until relieved by Anglo-Egyptian troops. "
- Bravo!
"The achievement was led and inspired... by two British officers of the Royal North Surrey Regiment... captured in the fight at Gakdul Wells,
Lieutenants Burroughs and Willoughby. "
Peter! Alive!
And good old Willoughby!
Isn't that splendid!
- What's the time?
- The time? It's just on 7:00.
- We'll go tonight.
- What?
We'll be the first to tell Ethne and the old man.
Ha! He'll be crazy with excitement about this!
- Joe! Joe!
- Yes, sir?
Pack my bag. Send a message round to
Dr. Sutton's house to send his bag round here.
We're going to General Burroughs's.
The 8:15 from Paddington.
Oh, but I've got an important appointment in the morning, John.
- And, Joe!
- Yes, sir?
Tell Dr. Sutton's man to cancel all his appointments for tomorrow.
Oh, but Ethne and the general will know before we get there.
They won't. They never get the evening papers in that place until the morning.
We'll just walk in and break the news.
And the War Office is certain to send a telegram.
You've always got some confoundedly cold-blooded reason for doing nothing.
Anyway, we'll be the first to congratulate them.
Don't you realize what this means?
Peter alive, and done a grand job of work into the bargain.
- Is there any more? Read that last bit again.
- Huh?
- "Lieutenants Burroughs and Willoughby'-
- Hmm.
"... whose release from prison was due to an act of heroism... described to me personally by Lieutenant Burroughs.
A man posing as a dumb Sangali native gained entrance to the prison... with means of cutting the chains of the captives.
He suffered torture and faced death to do so... because in reality, he was until recently... an officer of their own regiment. "
Lieutenant Faversham.
But why should he try to rob me?
- Doctor.
- Yes, John?
There's some notepaper on my desk there.
I want you to write a letter for me.
I'm ready, John.
To Ethne Burroughs.
Dear Ethne...
I've just had some splendid news.
I've been to a famous German eye doctor... and my sight can be restored.
Got that?
I've got that, John.
It means a long course of treatment in Germany... and I leave tomorrow.
When I can see again,
I shall return to the army... with the happy memory... of all you have done... to help me through.
I'll sign it myself.
And add a postscript.
PS:
Just heard the splendid news of Peter and Willoughby... and Harry Faversham.
I enclose a little souvenir of a journey through the desert... with a dumb Sangali native.
If you'll give him the chance that he deserves... you'll find he's not... as mute... as I thought he was.
That's all.
Your bags are packed, sir.
There's just time for a bite of dinner if you hurry.
All right, Joe.
We're not going after all.
I -
I still say the army of today is soft compared with our day.
Soft! That's your trouble.
Still, you did your best... and as Harry has made you two young rascals take your feathers back... well, he'd better marry the girl and have done with it, eh, Doc, hmm?
It's not as easy as all that.
There's my feather too.
What deed of reckless daring are you going to do... to make me take back my feather?
Must I?
Deeds of reckless twaddle.
Stuff and nonsense.
No such thing nowadays.
All you boys had to do was deal with Fuzzy-Wuzzy.
But the Crimea was different.
War was war in those days.
No room for weaklings.
- Take Balaclava, for instance.
- Ah.
Of course, you fellows wouldn't remember the position, but it was this -
Ah, thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.
Here were the Russians.
Guns. Guns. Guns.
On the right, the British infantry.
One moment, sir.
Your famous account of Balaclava's not accurate, you know.
- Not -
- Not accurate, sir.
Not accurate?
No, sir.
Let me recall the position.
Out of the way, Peter.
Here are the Russians, behind the walnuts.
Guns. Guns. Guns.
Here's the British Infantry.
The thin red line.
Here's the commander in chief.
And here are you... at the head of the old 68th, correct?
Absolutely.
You were riding a horse called Caesar, which my father sold you... because, fine horseman though he was, he could never hold him himself.
Quite right. Quite right.
Then, according to your story, you said...
"The 68th will move forward. "
Quite right. Quite right.
Yes, sir.
The trouble is, you never said it.
- Ne -
- You never said it, sir.
- Never said it?
- No, sir. You never had time.
At that moment, my father told me, Caesar - uh, Caesar - Caesar... startled by a stray bullet, took the bit between his teeth... and dashed straight at the Russian lines.
Away went Caesar, away went you, away went the 68th... away went the commander in chief, away went everybody... and another magnificent mistake was added to an already magnificent record.
But nobody ever said,
"The 68th will move forward. "
Unless it was the horse.
Come on, sir. Own up.
Well, well, well, well, after all these years, it's rather difficult to remember all the details... but... confound the boy!
I shall never be able to tell that story again!
Ethne, your feather.
All right, gents, that's it.
At ease.
- Glad to see you aboard, Cobb.
- Thank you, sir.
- Take charge of number one section up forward.
- Aye, sir.
- Glad to see you aboard, Costello.
- I'm glad to be aboard, Captain.
I was with your father in the Philippines.
I'll never forget the night-
Yes, I remember quite well.
He told me about it, Costello.
In fact, I read it in his memoirs.
Now, men... we've got a tough job in front of us.
We're headed for the submarine zone.
May seem strange to you men to be going on such a mission in a vessel like this.
This boat is known as a mystery ship.
Some people call it Q-boat.
We're acting as a decoy.
Our main object is to sail out there and be torpedoed by enemy U-boats.
Are there any questions to be asked?
Captain, don't we get a chance to put in a lick for ourselves?
Plenty of chance, Costello.
- Mr. MacGregor, stand ready with that forward hatch.
- Very well, sir.
Gun crew, fall out.
Follow Mr. MacGregor.
All right, stand by that lanyard.
Ready? Drop it!
Come on, drop it! Hurry up!
- It's a beauty!
- Oh, baby!
Take your dirty hands off of there!
That's as pretty a gun as I've looked at in years.
There is a Santa Claus after all.
I'm 20 years in the navy, and I don't think
I've ever looked at a sweeter rifle than that.
Turn it around there, Doggy.
They'll listen when this lady speaks.
Margolis, you'll be a busy man cleaning the brass work on this girl.
- And, Captain-
- Go ahead, Guns.
With your permission, and in honor of this day...
I'd like to christen this gun in honor of the only girl I ever loved that I know loved me-
Judy Ann McCarthy.
- Permission granted.
- You're okay, baby.
- Keep your hand off of Judy’s breech!
What do you think of her, Guns?
It's a proud man I am this day to be in charge of a gun like this.
Captain, I beg your pardon. I'm beginning to understand this mystery ship business.
Are we looking for just any U-boat, or some particular U-boat?
The biggest of them all, Cobb.
It's Baron von Steuben, the ace of the U-boat captains.
I understand, sir.
He's the skipper of U172.
He's done more to hurt the Allies than any six outfits put together.
Been sinking everything in sight... off the coast of Gibraltar in Spain- that's where we're headed.
With-With just this to hunt him?
Mr. Cobb,
I'll ask you to stop insulting my gun.
Mr. MacGregor, arrange contact with Captain Day.
- Have him come to surface immediately.
- Very well, sir.
All right, fall out, you men.
Stand by your stations.
Get this gun covered up, Costello.
Have your deckhouse in shape.
I told you there was nothing screwy about this ship!
Steady! Steady now, Doggy!
- And keep your dirty hands off of that gun!
- Yes, sir!
Hello? Let me speak to Captain Day, please.
Hello, Captain Day?
This is MacGregor speaking.
Captain Kingsley wishes you to come to the surface right away. Very well, sir.
- Sir, who were you talking to?
- To the submarine we have in tow.
Can't understand it.
Could I get Flatbush 4442?
Hello, Jacobs!
I thought you was in jail!
- When did you get on that thing?
- I don't know. They put me here.
- Glad to see you.
- Glad to see you too.
Captain Day, meet our executive officer,
Mr. MacGregor.
- Hi, Captain. Nice to see you.
- How do you do?
- Tommy, old boy! Gee, I'm glad to see ya!
- Capt. Day, Ensign Cabot.
- Sort of a sailing master around here.
- Glad to meet you.
Very glad to know you, sir.
Thank you.
- Bring him up promptly, Skipper?
- Certainly will.
- How's she heading, Tony?
- She rides fine.
- Captain!
- What is it, Elmer?
- Can I take a picture of you and the-
- No!
- Yes, sir.
- Don't say that, Elmer.
- Say aye, aye, sir.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- How's that towline heading?
- Perfect. You might give me 50 feet more.
- Request granted.
- Captain, how are the telephones working?
- Okay. Okay.
- Glad to hear it.
We'll cruise on top a while, then cast off.
Four or five days, we'll duck you under.
- Good luck.
- See you later, Tommy, old boy.
Stand by your lines!
Come on, gang!
Let's give 'em a yell, huh?
Up! Up! Up! Up!
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
Tonight's the night!
Tonight's the night!
All right, all you men! Lean forward!
On the double now! Step on it. Get going, sailor.
All hands lay up for the tag drill!
Come on, Kaufman!
Duty calls! Come on!
Quiet now. Step lively.
Snap into it down there.
Snap into it.
I watched you boys in your physical drill this morning.
I'm very proud of you.
I like that spirit you're showing.
I think it's done me a lot of good already,
Captain. Look.
Yes, it has.
Keep it up, Tommy.
Now, men, I'm going to instruct you in the panic drill.
Panic drill?
I've been in the navy a long time, but I never heard of a panic drill.
It's not in the regulations, Cobb.
We're going into the submarine zone disguised as a merchant schooner.
But what if we're torpedoed, sir?
In the hold of this ship is a load of railroad ties and cork.
Anyway,
U-boats don't waste torpedoes.
They come to the surface and try and sink tubs like this with gunfire.
Everybody goes haywire and abandons ship.
- You're the lads that go haywire.
- Oh, I see.
The idea is to make the enemy think we're harmless so she'll come in closer.
That's it exactly.
Men, I want you to remember this.
Act like a merchant crew, not navy men.
You mean, to run around the decks like we're scared, sir? Frightened?
Yeah, like a lot of chickens with your heads cut off.
And furthermore, if you don't put on a good show... the U-boat'll lie off there and blow you to pieces.
- Oh, we'll do our part, sir.
- Yes, sir!
That's the stuff.
Now, have any of you boys ever had any amateur theatrical experience?
Thurston has, sir!
What plays have you been in,
Thurston?
East Lynne.
Last year we played
Bertha, the Sewing Machine Girl.
Uh, what did you play in The Sewing Machine Girl?
I played Bertha.
All right, Thurston, you play the captain's wife in the first panic party.
All right, you men, report to Mr. Cabot, get up in the shrouds.
- Look over that water. It'll do you good now.
All right, you men!
Come on! Make it lively!
All right, Mr. Cabot, come down, take over the lads.
All right, boys, let's go along.
Come on!
Up you go, and set your topsails!
Hey, you boots. Come over here.
Come on, snap it up.
Snap it up. Step lively there.
Where did you guys learn to do that?
Why, we're from seaport towns, sir.
We know a lot about boats.
The fact is, some of our boys were on that crew... belonging to the last cup defenders.
Gee, I couldn't do that meself!
Mr. Costello, after the war is over and we come back... we hope we're sailor men like you.
I hope you are, boys.
The country'll be safe.
Don't you think the boys up there are doing very well?
Well, they're doing well as boys.
But not as they did in my day.
In my day, we had no ladders.
I've seen meself "lepp" off the roof of a wheelhouse like that... halfway up the mast.
For years I was known... as Lepper Costello.
Well, Mr. Costello, would you give us an idea of how you did it?
Oh, no. I'm too busy now.
Margolis!
Clean off that breech block!
- Aw, please!
- Just show us the start.
Well, I'll give ya an idea of the start.
Course, I'll be a bit stiff.
Climbing a ladder is nothing.
Sure, monkeys can do that.
But when I was a lad we'd come down to the deck in the morning like this-
And set yourself here.
And there's your mast.
Watch me now.
Hoo-whee! And up!
Gee!
- There he is!
- There I am!
Watch me now, boys!
And you'll notice every move in me as graceful as a gazelle.
- Get the boat!
Right down here.
Stand by! All right, get hold of him there.
Nice work, Cabot!
- Attaboy!
That's great! That's fine, baby!
- Get a line there!
- Get a line in there!
All right, stand by now!
Oh, dear! Oh, dear!
You all right?
- Careful!
Are you all right?
Give him a hand.
Pull up that lifeline.
- How are you, laddie?
- I'm fine.
Cabot, I'm glad to have you aboard.
- You're gonna make a fine officer.
- Thank you, sir.
Where's that channel swimmer?
- Congratulations, Cabot. You were fine.
- Thanks very much.
Pardon me, Mr. Cabot.
We're all very proud of you too, sir.
- And I'm glad to be serving under you.
- Thank you very much, Chief.
- Kaufman!
- Yes, sir!
Get a drink of brandy!
Aye, aye, sir.
Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear!
Let go of me pants!
You'll have me half naked!
Oh, dear, oh, dear. Why didn't you throw me a boat when I asked you for it?
- I thought you could swim!
- Who says I can't swim?
- What were you hollerin' for us to throw you a rope for?
I was tryin' to fool the lads to see if any of them were man enough... to "lepp" over after me.
And now, me lad, there's your first lesson in seamanship... from Shark Costello.
Oh, dear.
Gee, Guns Costello falls off the boat... and the captain commands me to get a drink.
I can't understand it.
Another one?
- Did you send for us, Captain?
- Yes, Cobb, yes.
We're approaching the Canary Islands.
Gonna put in to one of those banana ports there.
London tells us it's headquarters for enemy U-boats- refueling and so forth.
We're gonna pick up provisions... oil and water for this tub we got in tow.
Pardon me, gentlemen.
Do you think a fella could get tattooed in this port?
Anything is liable to happen to you in this port.
Show him yours.
Listen, fellas.
"Death before dishonor."
That's a noble sentiment.
Say, that is "purty," ain't it?
"Death before dishonor."
Yeah. I never thought of it that way.
All right, sons... there will be a liberty party formed to go ashore here.
The captain's orders are, no drinking of hard liquor.
- Of course not, Mr. Cobb.
And no fraternizing with women!
Understand, mugs?
No fraternizing with women!
No fraternizin' with women?
I never done a thing like that in my life.
- Terrific idea, boys!
- Yeah!
Simpatico.
Un momento, caballero.
I'm very sorry.
I don't understand a thing you say.
I'm just a visitor here, you see.
No, caballero.
Don't worry. I'll straighten it out all right. Just relax.
Oh, I understand. You want your picture taken. Well, that's fine. Smile.
- No, no, no, no.
- Pardon the interruption.
He's trying to explain to you you're not supposed to take any photographs out here.
Oh. I'm very sorry.
See, I didn't understand.
I'm awfully sorry.
I wonder why he was kicking about me photographing that old tub out there.
Well, you see, those boats were sunk out there by the German submarines.
- U-boats?
- Yes.
- And there's some law against photographing them.
- Oh?
Is there any law against photographing you?
No.
But why should you want to take a photograph of me?
Sailors like me that sort of bump around the world-
As a matter of fact, it's a hobby of mine... to photograph the most beautiful thing
I see in every port.
- You don't mind, do you?
Of course. I knew you wouldn't.
- No.
That's fine.
Now, just move a little that way.
Oh, this'll be perfect.
Un momento, caballero.
I'm sorry.
I'm only photographing the lady.
- Oh.
- Fine. You take us both.
- Fine, now. Press that right there.
- That's fine. Isn't that nice of him?
- ¿Listo?
- Uh-huh.
- Thank you. That's very nice.
- Gracias, señor.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
If you give me your address,
I'll send you a dozen prints or so.
Well-
You know, we haven't really met yet.
You misunderstood me. I didn't say
I'd bring them. I said I'd send them.
- Captain!
I think that's gonna be a very pretty picture.
I hope it turns out all right.
So do I.
Elmer, I want to see the negatives when they're developed.
Aye, aye, sir!
Very splendid chap.
Upstanding fellow.
Be a great sailor someday... I hope.
Hoffman.
Remember,
I'm to see you later on the prado.
- Yes?
- Yes. I'll be walking up and down the prado.
- When?
- Well, until you come out.
Well, uh, maybe I'll be walking along the prado a little later, Mr. -
Bob.
Cognac?
Anna Marie!
- Franz!
- Leibling.
- Fräulein.
I don't want to worry those boys unnecessarily.
- Do you mind if we speak English?
- No. But why? Is there anything wrong?
No. But that sailing ship that came in last night-
H-7 reports that she's an American.
- American? After us?
- Who knows?
- But they wouldn't dare come in here.
- Don't we dare?
- Oh, yes, but-
- But we're braver, eh?
We mustn't flatter ourselves.
Oh, I can't believe-
- You can't believe what?
- Nothing.
Oh, Franz, when I think of the danger that you face out there-
- Don't worry about me. My life's charmed.
It's your brother Ernst and the rest of my pals out there that I worry about.
Them and you. You shouldn't be coming out with us today on that trawler.
- How else can I see Ernst?
- I know. He's in command, and he can't leave his ship.
- The risk is too great.
- Oh, yes, I know, but I must see him.
Meine herren.
- Fräulein.
Good-bye, dear.
I'll see you tonight on the trawler... if you insist on coming to the rendezvous.
I wish to heaven you were home again, safe in Germany.
Safe, but useless.
You see, I can serve you and Ernst better this way.
They'd never suspect a woman.
Auf Wiedersehen.
Congratulations on your past service,
Fräulein Lolita.
- Thank you.
- You have your orders.
- You understand them?
Perfectly.
With these American officers, you must be very careful.
I'm always careful with all officers.
Fräulein.
- Adios.
- Auf Wiedersehen, mein fräulein.
It was in Algeciras
That I met my first love
Alas, what a short and sad love
He died in his boots at sea, ahh
Then came a bold mate
From a port called Vigo
He called every stranger amigo
And drowned all his cares with rum, ahh
Last came a skipper
From gay Barcelona
Strangled was he
By a strand of blond hair
So
Now that I'm free and filled with an eager yearning
For one who is bold
A lover with passion burning
Where is the man
That will dare fortune's losses
He must be brave
Who will win a Gypsy's kisses
You ain't even been here before!
I don't understand it!
He ain't even Spanish.
You forgot your shawl.
Mm-hmm.
Give it to me, and come in.
- Are you sure it's all right?
- Naturally.
- Are you afraid to coming in my room?
- No.
And you were such a bold caballero downstairs.
- Come.
- I guess it was the music. And you!
- And your singing.
- Oh, no, no. She is no good.
But my dancing-¡Olé! ¡Olé!
Why are you so shy up here?
- I'm not going to hurt you much.
And you were so bold downstairs.
Walked so straight, like a soldier.
- Maybe you're an officer!
- Oh, no!
What made you say that?
- I guess it was the music.
Want some cognac?
Uh, it's a little early in the day for me. I, uh-
I don't think I'd better.
Hmm. She is too strong.
I don't like him either.
I have some old wine from my country.
I give it to you.
You come with me?
The name of this wine, she is Lágrimas de Amor.
- What does it mean?
- "Tears of Love."
Please.
I really don't think I'd better.
Please? A little bit?
You want me to like you more?
Oh, do I!
Well, here I am, waiting on the prado.
- Here I am, walking on the prado, Mr. -
- Bob.
I was gonna call you Captain Bob.
That's your ship, isn't it?
Yes, that's the old scow-
40 decks, all glass, concrete bottom... and bales of straw.
- Now you're spoofing!
- Oh, no, I'm not.
But you can't fool me. I have a brother who considers himself quite a mariner.
- So I know a little about boats.
- All right, my boat-what is she?
Well, that's just a good, old three-masted schooner.
Captain, I hate to be a tattletale, but orders are orders.
- I just saw Mr. Cobb talking to some women.
- No!
- Yes, sir.
- Tsk, tsk, tsk.
Weren't your orders strictly not to fraternize with them?
Yes. I'll tell you, Elmer.
You remind me of it when we get aboard ship.
Don't tell anyone.
- It's between you and me.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Let's take a walk before he tells on me.
Sailing this afternoon?
- Yes.
- When?
Sailor's luck. Sailing on the tide.
I never wanted to stay in a port so much in all my life as I do this one.
- You're coming back, aren't you?
- Do you want me to come back?
- Then I'll be back.
- When?
Oh, well, that depends on a lot of things.
Say, I've got a snapshot of you here, but I don't know your name.
Are you really coming back?
Yes.
Bob, it's Anna Marie.
Anna Marie.
You like me?
Gee, you're like somebody you dream about- strange, different from any of the girls I ever knew at home.
I could always figure them out, but I can't you.
When I listen to you sing or talk...
I feel like I'm- like I'm drinking wine.
Now you're bold again.
I like you that way.
- Have some more wine.
- I've- I've had enough.
- I've gotta get back.
- Get back where?
- I've gotta get back.
- Why?
Because- Because...
Captain said... can't be... too careful.
Can't be- Ohh!
Hoffman!
- Hoffman!
- Ja, Fräulein?
"Ensign Cabot."
No- Speak the English.
Don't know a word.
- No?
- Going upstairs.
- Very handsome, sir, those naval academy rings.
Oh, yes, yes. Thanks very much.
Prost.
Perhaps I might suggest a better toast, Captain.
Why not?
To our next meeting.
Let's hope it'll be real soon,
Herr, uh, Oberleutnant.
You see that, Mac?
- I'll be.
- Stumbled right into 'em.
Suppose they notify the Spanish authorities about us.
Oh, no.
They're too smart for that.
They'd be interned themselves.
Well, I don't like the looks of things.
- You don't?
- No.
- Mac, it's a stroke of luck.
- What do you mean?
They're here for the same purpose we are- to get food and refuel.
I'll bet my salary against yours that we meet them outside the head within 24 hours.
- You really think so?
- Sure. Get all the men together.
- See that every man is mustered in.
I'll get the papers.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Sir!
- Yes?
- Can I borrow another-
- No! Report aboard immediately!
Aye, aye, sir.
- Good evening, sir.
- Step lively. Step lively. On you go.
- That's the last of 'em. Everybody aboard.
- Captain!
Mr. Cabot hasn't reported yet, sir.
- Positive, Cobb?
- Yes, sir.
Organize a searching party right away.
Let's find him.
Very well, sir. All right, all you men!
Up you come! On the double!
Kaufman, take out a searching party.
Doggy, go with Kaufman.
MacGregor, take a searching party.
You men come with me.
On the double!
Make it snappy there!
All right, Chief, keep a lookout.
Waggoner! Jenkins!
To the cantina right away.
Cobb, the other end of the prado.
Three men.
- Double quick!
- Come with me right away.
- You haven't seen a young officer off a merchant ship, have you?
- No! No!
- Are you sure he wasn't here buying something?
- I told you, no! No!
Aww- Come on.
- No reports yet, sir.
- Keep a lookout, both of you.
Cabot?
- No report as yet, sir.
- All right. Board ship! Board ship!
- No report yet, sir.
- All right. Stand by, Kaufman.
Kaufman, keep a lookout for the chief.
Order one shore boat.
- No report yet.
- Stand on the dock.
- That's the last man, Captain.
- I hate to leave that kid here in a strange port.
- Yeah, it's pretty tough, all right.
- Just got his commission.
First trip.
If I didn't have to get fuel aboard the sub,
I'd search every hole on this island.
- Say, Mac, you don't suppose-
- Suppose what?
- Nothing. I was thinking about those three Germans we met.
- The tide is changing.
- We'd better be going aboard ship.
- All right, all right.
Everybody aboard!
Captain Kingsley!
Captain Kingsley!
Captain Kingsley!
All right, Mac, head 'er out to sea.
- Ensign Cabot left in port.
- Very well, sir.
All right, Quartermaster, up to 230.
I think, for safety, we'd better change the name of this schooner.
Pick any name and have it painted on the side.
Well, Captain, for a vessel with such graceful lines and a splendid, broad beam...
I can think of no prettier name than the Judy Ann McCarthy... the name of the girl I loved.
Two hundred and eighty pounds of as nice a girl as-
Margolis, get me a can of paint!
Mm-hmm!
Danke schön.
Ernst!
Kapitän.
- Ernst!
Ja.
Ja.
I am... Ensign Richard Cabot...
United States...
Navy.
Please tell Captain-
Captain-
How it hurts.
- Tell-Tell Captain-
I- I-
Franz. Ernst.
Ja.
Ernst.
Auf Wiedersehen.
Auf Wiedersehen, Ernst.
Anna Marie.
They're oil barrels all right, Chief.
Gangway there.
Captain, it looks like a fire.
But I'd be careful.
It might be a trap.
There's a body floating around there, sir.
- All right. Mac?
- Yes, sir.
- Stand by with that whale boat.
- Very well, sir.
Small boat on the starboard beam!
Hey, Joe! Your outer jib!
All right. I'll fix it.
All right, sailors! Come alongside!
We'll pick you up.
Stand by!
Ho! Heave ho!
- Heave!
- All right. A little further.
- Heave!
- Heave!
All right, miss. Watch your head on the boom coming by here.
- Okay. Shove off now.
- Shove away. Shove away, boy.
- Shove away.
- All right.
Take it easy there.
All right.
Have that girl come off there.
All right. Get off, young lady!
All right.
Get that young lady aboard here.
Come on.
- Hands off that line there!
- Hands off the line!
Steady with that boat hook.
- All right now.
- All right. On the deck, young lady.
- Off you go!
Stand by, Cobb. Stand by.
Get ahold of that lady.
All right, miss.
Get ahold of it, miss.
You've only got 15 miles. You can make it all right. Toss it over there. All right.
Oh, thank you so much! We've been drifting out in that boat for hours.
- Bob!
- Mr. MacGregor.
- Yes, sir.
- Take this lady to my cabin, get her something warm to drink.
- Very well. Come along.
Come along, miss. This way.
- But, Bob!
All right, you sailors. Shove off.
You've got 15 miles to shore.
- You're welcome. You're welcome.
- All right.
- Tie that- Tie that line.
Yes?
Bob!
Anna Marie.
I'm sorry to inform you, but I'm forced to detain you aboard as a prisoner.
A prisoner? For what?
What have I done?
One of our junior officers was found dead, floating near some oil barrels.
One of your junior officers?
From this ship?
Yes. Ensign Cabot.
Did you know him?
Why, no-
Why should I know him?
He was found in the vicinity of your lifeboat.
Therefore, I must hold you for investigation.
But you can't do that!
I'm a- I'm a Danish subject.
We'll keep you as comfortable as possible.
But you've got to listen to me!
You must give me a chance to explain!
Good night.
- Bob, will you-
- Something you want, miss?
No. Thank you.
- How 'bout some java, Skipper?
All right, Kaufman. Hurry up with that breakfast. You're wanted topside.
Orders of the day:
Panic party stand by.
All hands remain below deck.
Today is the day.
- Hey, miss!
- What ya tryin' to do?
- Oh, come on, miss. What's the matter with you?
You're gonna get us into trouble!
Get up out of that boat!
Are you trying to give us
French leave or somethin'?
The captain is gonna give us the deuce if you do that.
Come on. Let's go down here where you belong.
- What's happened here?
- The young lady tried to go over the side in a boat.
Get that boat into shape.
Keep out of sight with those white hats.
Come on, come on, come on.
What's the matter with you, sister?
Be a good kid and stay here where you belong, instead of running all over the ship.
Sure. You'll get us all in trouble putting that boat over the side like that.
Captain's dotey enough as it is.
- And say, Gretchen-
- Gretchen?
- Hilda, Hilda.
- Oh, whatever her name is.
Say, why don't you go over there and cork off?
You know, take a nap, go to sleep.
And if you're a good little girl,
I'll get you some coffee.
- And I'll get you a magazine full of swell pictures.
- What do you say?
- All right, men. Topside. On the double. Come on.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Well, Anna Marie, don't you think it's about time you cut out these tricks?
- Oh, Bob, don't be so hard.
- Hard?
Say, do you realize you should be shot for a spy?
Spy? I- I told you last night I'm Swedish.
Swedish. Last night you told me you were Danish.
Now, you're neither Danish nor Swedish.
You're German.
And you had something to do with the refueling of that U-boat.
That's why I'm holding you a prisoner.
Why, Bob, I thought you liked me.
Sure I liked you.
First time I saw you ashore,
I liked you.
I'm human.
You're a woman... and not hard to look at.
You liked me then.
What's wrong with me now?
There's nothing wrong with you,
Anna Marie. I wish to, well-
That's got nothing to do with it.
Don't you realize there's something going on in this world much bigger than you and I?
War.
Don't you realize, Bob, there's something even bigger than war?
No. For you and me, no.
Oh, Bob, please let me go.
Let me have a small boat.
I'll go ashore. I'll get there somehow.
What for? To cause more trouble?
I want you to understand this, Anna Marie.
I'm an American officer.
I'm in command of an American ship... and it's my duty to hold you here.
You, an American officer, in command of an American ship!
Where's your colors?
Where's your uniform?
I know where they are.
They're hidden away in that closet.
Why? Are you ashamed of them?
Why don't you hoist your colors and put on your uniform and get up there and fight... like a man, like a sailor, like my brother?
- Like your brother?
- Yes. Captain Von Steuben.
The man you're looking for, commander of the U172.
Oh, we know all about you,
Captain Kingsley, and your mystery ship.
We know your mission.
We know you're out to get my brother.
But you won't get him.
He's far too brave and clever to be trapped... by this pack of rats you've got hiding in the hold of this ship!
Oh, I hope to goodness you find him.
I hope he meets you.
He'll answer your insults!
Why, he'll break you to pieces like a-
Bob. Captain.
We're picking up a submarine on our hydrophones about two miles away.
Good. Good.
All right, men. Shove off.
Anna Marie, I think you're gonna get your wish.
- Sure you got 'em?
- Yes, sir.
It's a German U-boat all right.
- About a mile and a half away.
- Uh-huh.
- You can hear 'em yourself, sir.
You're right. Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
- Mac, contact Captain Day.
Pipe all hands. Oh, Cobb.
- Right-o.
- Yes, sir.
- Give those reserves below a little fight talk.
- The old hero stuff. Ten yards to go.
- All right, sir.
Die for dear old-You know what I mean.
What's his name.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Captain Day is right here, sir.
You bet we're ready, sir.
Captain Kingsley, sir.
- Contact, sir!
- I'll talk with him. Stand by.
I'll speak with him.
Hello, Shorty? Yeah, we just picked up-
You picked 'em up too, huh?
Good. Good. Stand ready to let go your hawser.
Uh-huh. Looks like the kickoff any minute now.
Thanks. Thanks. Same to you.
All right.
Panic party, on the topside.
On the double there!
Remember, Myrtle.
Don't forget to scream.
She's a half a mile off now, sir.
All right, you men. Snap into it.
Fall in now. On the double!
- Make it snappy there now. Come on. Come on.
- Pick it up.
- Where's that man playing the captain's wife?
- Here, sir.
All right. What's this?
What have you got here?
- In the last act of Bertha, the Sewing Machine Girl-
- Never mind it.
Give him the parrot there. I want you men to carry on as instructed. Is that understood?
- Aye, aye, sir.
- You, in the aft cabin, on the double.
- You, up on the bridge.
The rest of you men in position.
- Snap into it now!
- You there!
- Yes, sir!
- That ain't regulation, sir.
- No, it's a boy.
Keep that machine gun below deck.
Come on. Watch those white hats.
Ja. 
Mystery ship.
- Mystery ship?
"Judy Ann McCarthy."
"Judy Ann McCarthy."
- They're right on top of us, sir.
- Yes, I can see them.
Come on now, Margolis. Stand by.
Give it to 'em when you get a chance.
Aye, sir.
Well, Stanley Northcross II, are you ready to make history?
Yes, sir. Ready and anxious, sir.
With the captain's permission, look.
It's fine, Stanley. Great.
But what will your mother say?
Well, that, sir, is problematical.
- Oh, Captain-
- Wait a minute. Down, fellows.
Now, don't get anxious.
Keep your heads down, you men.
- Have you got the bag full?
- Yes, sir.
That's the old pepper.
- How is she?
- Oh, just giving us the once-over.
Old periscope sticking straight up.
- I'm ready, sir.
- How are you, Saunders?
- Fine, thank you, sir.
- Good.
You didn't shave today, did you?
Well, you see, sir, I don't shave yet, sir.
That's right. You don't.
Well, you'll probably have a full beard by the time this is over.
Thank you, sir. I hope so.
Keep it down now, fellows. Keep it down.
- Captain, I'd like to show-
- I'll look at it later.
I'll look at all you boys later.
Keep your heads down.
Keep your ears and eyes open.
All right, fellows. Now keep your eyes open there. Ready to go at any moment now.
- Help! Don't fire! Don't fire!
- Hold it!
Feuer!
- All right, you fellows-
All right! Go aft! Go aft, you men!
Aft you go!
Try and contact that guy!
- Whoo!
- Hey, wait a minute! Wait a minute!
No!
That flag's international code-
"Stay away."
Bob, let-
- Finnegan!
- Aye, aye, sir.
Take this woman and put her in that boat.
Take that other boy and keep him aboard here.
She makes a move, shoot her.
Get that girl aboard.
There.
All right. Snap into it.
Let those poles go.
Keep your eyes open.
We'll go any minute.
- All right.
- All right.
Panic party's away and clear, sir.
All right. Fine. Great stuff, Mac.
Shelling damage your hull much, sir?
Oh, it put quite a hole in it, Mac.
- Taking on quite a bit of water?
- About eight feet of water.
She's taking a wide swing around us now, sir.
Head into her a little, Mac.
Head into her.
- We've got quite a bit of drift too, sir.
- Head into her.
- Pretty damp, eh, Cobb?
- Just a trifle, Captain.
- Little afraid of that panic party.
- You are, sir?
Yeah, I think they're wise to us out there.
Watch those white caps!
Pipe down, all of you back there!
No, Shorty, no. No, no. Stand by.
Well, Saunders, how do you feel?
Well, I-I feel pretty good, sir.
Thank you, sir.
You're a veteran now.
You've been under fire.
Were you a little nervous, a little frightened?
Well, yes, Captain, I-I was-Well-
Aw, Captain, I'll confess.
I was a bit frightened at first, but I'll stick it out. Look!
We want to keep away from that U-boat.
Now hard on that port oar there!
Hiya, miss. You feel all right?
Better put that around you.
Mystery ship.
No, no. Not yet.
Not yet. I'll tell you when.
- Get that contact, Cobb.
- Yes, sir.
Telephone.
All right, you men. Get ahold of that tarpaulin down there, you!
All right, Captain.
Here we go, Captain.
- All right. Cut her off, Cobb.
- All right, sir.
No, I'll tell you when.
Hold off down there. I'll tell you when.
Keep that gun covered down there.
All right, you men.
Stand by, all you men. Stand by.
Keep down up there!
- Hold off. I'll tell you when.
Get that contact again, Cobb.
- Yes, sir.
Yeah. Hello, Shorty. Yeah.
Oh, fine, fine. We got a lot of water.
About eight feet, I guess.
No, the railroad ties will keep her afloat.
She's all right.
- Hold it. Keep that contact.
- Yes, sir. I got it.
All merchant marine outfits have been accounted for... except one derby hat, size seven and an eighth.
- What'll I do about it?
- Write me a letter, Elmer.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Yes. Hello, Shorty. No, no.
Stand by. Stand by, Shorty.
Don't get anxious.
All right. Stand by those pumps, men, and work 'em!
I'm afraid she's filling up faster than they can pump it out, Captain.
- Contact, Cobb.
- The water's getting higher, sir.
It's up around the magazines.
- All the men out of the hold?
- Yes, sir.
No, sir. Elmer's down there.
- Go down and tell him I said to come up out of there.
- Yes, sir.
- All right. Contact, Captain.
- Hello, hello.
- Just a minute, Shorty. What is it, Mac?
- It looks hopeless, Bob.
She won't come any closer.
She won't engage us.
- Get back contact.
- Yes, sir.
- All right. Contact, sir.
- Hello, Shorty.
I'm about to lay a U-boat in your lap.
Yeah. You're on your own.
We're sinking here.
Stand by to cast off the towline.
And good luck.
All right, you men! Attention!
I want you men to stand ready... to abandon ship!
Elmer! Hey, Elmer!
- Oh, Elmer.
- What do you want, son?
The captain wants you top-
Why, Elmer Skilling, you're smoking cigarettes.
I'm gonna tell your mother.
- Go on. Scram, punk.
- Listen. You can't talk to me that way!
- Anyway, the captain wants you topside right away.
- Orders is orders.
- He told me to stay down here.
- Well, he told me that-
- Where's Elmer and Saunders?
- Down below, sir.
- In the hold, sir.
- They're below deck, sir.
They are? Keep your heads down, men.
Keep your heads down!
- Yes, sir.
- Stand ready with that hose.
All right. Second panic party.
- Over the side. On the double. Quick!
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Hey! Hey!
- Hey!
All right, Cobb.
You're in command of the ship now.
Aye, sir. Thank you, sir.
- Come on, Mac. You've lived long enough.
- Okay, Skipper.
All right! Stand by on topside!
Stand by, you fellows, to take Elmer.
- I got him.
- Pull him out.
Pull him out there.
Just down there. Just down there.
All right, MacGregor?
Elmer. Come on.
You all right, Elmer?
Quick. Come on, wake up.
Wake up!
Wake up. Wake up, boys!
Wake up. Wake up.
- Wake up.
- Okay, Elmer?
Come on, Tommy old boy.
You're all right! That's the stuff.
I lost the derby hat.
I'm sorry, Captain.
That's all right. We'll get another one.
All right! Stand by!
The U-boat's coming into range, sir!
Captain!
The U-boat's coming into range!
All right! Stand by your stations!
Stand by your stations.
Stand by.
All right.
Go back to your stations.
Costello? Costello?
- Here she comes, sir.
- Costello!
Here she comes, at point-blank range.
- Ernst!
- Hey!
- Sit down! What's the-
She's fallen for the trap, sir.
Bugler, stand by.
Here she comes.
- Here she comes.
- Stand ready, Costello.
Wait a second.
- Now, sir.
- Commence firing.
Thirty-one.
Feuer!
- Thirty-two!
Thirty-three!
All right.
They've had it. Give 'em hell!
Number one tube, ready for firing.
Number one tube, ready for firing.
Number one, ready for firing.
Number one tube ready for firing, sir.
- Stations for battle surface.
- Stations for battle surface.
Stations manned and ready, sir.
- Stand by.
- Stand by.
Stand by!
- Number one!
- Number one!
- Fire!
- Fire!
Number one, fire!
Costello, cease firing!
Mac, look! Spike! She's going down, and they're stickin' with it!
Stand by to lower that whale boat, pick 'em up.
- All you men, stand by to lower that port whale boat!
- Pick 'em up! Pick 'em up!
- All right, men.
- Auf Wiedersehen.
Auf Wiedersehen, Ernst.
Well, Anna Marie... we're going away.
Isn't there something you want to say to me?
No, Bob, there isn't.
I know different.
We've both got something to say... and we'll be sorry all our lives if we don't say it.
Well, Bob, what is there to say?
You've won.
Won?
I've lost.
Lost the only thing I ever cared for.
No, you haven't.
You'll never lose that.
- You mean that?
Still you're going away with your brother and your fian-
- Lieutenant Schiller.
- I'm going with my brother.
Oh, listen, Anna Marie.
You don't have to go.
Don't you see that little church over there?
Why, you and I could be the happiest people if you'll only-
No, Bob. Don't you see?
I've got to go.
They're my own people.
My country's sick, in trouble.
My people are losing.
If I didn't stick to them now,
I wouldn't be worth wanting.
I wouldn't be what you'd call a good sport.
- Oh, Bob, I can't make it clear to you.
- Oh, I understand, dear.
The picture of you and me-
It's on the film here.
- Here. You take it.
- Thanks.
You keep it for me.
Now I've got something to come back for.
All right, Lieutenant. Take your men.
Forward march!

In the backwoods of Tsarist Russia...
Good Lord!
What is that?
The Kryakovskys.
And which are those?
The Syshchovskys.
Here are the Syshchovskys.
Those are the Fylonovskys.
They're going on strike!
Where are you going,
Nikolai?
We have to support them.
Who do we need to support?
Well guys, let's go to the factory.
Wait, Kolka,
I'll teach you a lesson.
What?
I'll teach you a lesson.
Boss, I won't take any lessons from you.
Let's go, guys.
Brothers... what are you doing?
Where are you going?
What the hell are you doing?
Let's go, let's go.
I order you to disperse immediately.
I give you one minute to think.
Those arrested will not be released.
Hey!
Guys, have mercy!
Beat me instead, you scoundrel!
You're beating students!
Beat me instead!
You're beating educated people, damn it!
Wait, guys...
What's going on?
Robert Karlovich.
Hey, Robert Karlovich.
Would you like to play checkers?
Mit grossen Vergnugen!
With great pleasure,
Alexander Petrovich, but give me a minute.
I have to finish the letter to my son in Germany.
Please, have a seat.
Anka.
Are you running around again?
Can't stay at home?
You have a nice girl,
Alexander Petrovich.
- Go, go.
- Goodbye.
I got yours,
Alexander Petrovich.
Hello,
Alexander Feodorovich.
Alexander Feodorovich!
Alexander Feodorovich!
How long will it last?
- Will what last?
- The strike.
God knows!
So, that's the situation.
And who is Alexander
Feodorovich?
Our new tenant.
Social revolutionary democrat... a striker.
He is one of those who organized a strike in 1905.
And this one as well.
Look, he went somewhere again.
Daddy.
Daddy.
- Something happened.
- What do you want?
Get up, Senka.
Sen.
You sleep like hell.
Senka!
Get up, Senka.
- I'm talking to you.
- Why should I get up?
Dusya came.
Get out.
Let's go, let's go.
I'm talking to you.
Guten Morgen,
Robert Karlovich.
Hello,
Alexander Petrovich.
Hey, Robert Karlovich, shouldn't we go get some beer?
Alexander Petrovich, don't you know what is whistling over there?
They are whistling.
Maybe something has happened.
Let's go have a look and get some beer on our way.
With a great pleasure,
Alexander Petrovich.
I am getting ready.
What's going on,
Robert Karlovich?
Where is my hat?
One minute.
Try this on.
What do you think,
Alexander Petrovich?
I think it's fine.
I think so, too.
Let's go.
URGENT TELEGRAM

Departure Of Ambassadors
Departure Of Ambassadors
To Russian People!
We'll win easily.
My dear Robert Karlovich, we'll easily defeat those scoundrels!
What are you saying,
Alexander Petrovich?
I'm saying that we've got it won.
You won't win, Alexander Petrovich, we can fight pretty well.
You know me.
We have always fought together for your rights.
And you have trusted me and you should trust me again.
Now, in this fateful moment when the Germans have conquered our borders... what should we do?
You should look for the answer to this question in the heart of the Russian man.
In the face of the external enemy, let's forget internal class strife and stop the strike.
Let's bravely go to battle believing in victory.
Go to battle!
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
I am asking you.
- I'll go.
- Where will you go?
He won't go anywhere.
- No, I'll go.
- Where will you go?
Volunteer.
If I said so, it means I'll go.
I'm telling you, I'll go.
I'm telling you, I'll go.
What are you doing?
You're taking everything with you.
I'm telling you, let me go!
Wait.
Cowards.
I'll show you!
You're not going anywhere!
Cowards,
I told you to let me go!
What a fool.
So, Petrovich,
I am leaving my horse with you.
Take care of it.
I'll pay you when I return.
If I don't return, keep it.
It's war.
Band together, brothers!
They want to enslave and destroy us.
For our Father Tsar, for our Motherland, for Orthodox faith, let's fight.
All of us will go for the purpose of...
Lord, bless us to win.
Hurrah.
Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah.
God bless you, sons.
"Contract".
"Authorized representative of the Union of cities in the person of... on the one hand, and merchant of II Guild,
Mikin, on the other hand.
The present Contract on the supply of boots to the army at the price of..."
With a rasp, with a rasp.
Clean harder, harder.
Move like that, like that.
# And the German infantry #
# Faces the "Fortress on the Rhine" #
# And our brave cavalry #
# Is finally chasing after them #
# The artillery, with 10 big guns #
# And courage like old Fritz #
# Cannons rumbling by one by one #
# A forest full of bayonets #
# Slash like lighting through the air #
# And finally they call halt. #
- Hello, Robert Karlovich.
- Hello.
Be so kind as to accept what I owe you.
That's very kind of you.
Anichka.
No more checkers.
Daddy,
Daddy, are the Germans...
"Daddy, Daddy".
What do you want?
Hey!
Robert Karlovich!
Oh, son, son!
The years you've wasted!
One, two, three, four, five.
Six, seven, eight...
Cut it out!
Does someone need this?
No.
Kolka.
Kolya.
Nikolai... Kolka!
What do you want?
Go to the front line!
Quickly!
Why did you stay here?
I am asking, why?
- My tooth hurts.
- Get the hell out!
- I'll show you.
- What did I do? What?
- I'll show you.
- What have I done to you?
- I'll show you.
- What have I done to you?
What have I done to you?
What have I done to you?
What have I done to you?
What for? Leave me alone...!
Are you alive, or what?
It's okay. It's okay.
This means you're in captivity.
Hey, you...
OUR VALIANT TROOPS
HELD THE FRONT LINE OF THE ENEMY,
HAVING SEIZED RICH BOOTY
AND PRISONERS.
You scoundrels, betrayers of Jesus, you're all around here... you have to be shot.
You dirty Russian pigs.
You will have to pay the price for all of us, you no-good bums.
To the camp for prisoners of war:
Due to difficulties with food, as of today prisoners of war are permitted to leave the camp and go into the city to look for work from 10:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.
Signed by Colonel...
How much is the watch?
No, no, how... how much?
What time is it?
What time is it, sir?
It's 7:00 already.
I have to get back to the base.
They lock it at 7:30.
After work, we can go to town, but we have to be back on time.
I asked for work all over town.
I am a shoemaker.
Do you understand?
But everybody tells me,
"We don't have any work for Germans".
Russian soldiers at the front were not as hostile as the people here in town.
Do you understand?
You look a lot like my little sister, but she's shorter than you.
I haven't heard from her in a long time.
I think my little brother will soon have to join up.
I hope he doesn't end up on the Western Front, but in Russia instead.
That's better than Verdun.
Do you understand?
No, I don't understand.
It's okay.
I have to go.
It's late.
Goodbye.
- Who's here?
- Keep it down, for God's sake.
It's okay.
Keep it down.
- Would you like to eat?
- With great pleasure.
- With great pleasure.
- What? What?
"With great pleasure.
Pleasure".
"With great pleasure".
Do you speak German?
We had Robert Karlovich, an elderly German.
He left a long time ago.
They played checkers with my father all the time.
He was the one who taught me.
Why didn't you tell me earlier you could speak German?
We could have had such a nice conversation coming back.
I thought you didn't understand a word.
- Yes.
- What, yes?
- Do you have a knife?
- Right away.
Would you like some tea?
I didn't come to have tea.
What's the last name of your guest?
- Mueller III.
- What?
Mueller III.
Third... they had three Muellers in their army.
Look, dear Third.
Do me a favor, turn around and get out.
I insist that you leave.
Get out of here.
He is a shoemaker as well.
Get out of here, ugly German mug.
He is a shoemaker as well.
It's a shame,
Alexander Petrovich.
Stop teaching me!
I have teachers better than you.
Where's the way out?
- The way out?
- Yes, yes.
There.
Anka.
Thank you for everything.
So long.
Hey!
Take it out and show it.
Are you a shoemaker?
Yes, I am a shoemaker.
You know what? Let's go.
You'll work for me.
I used to work from home as well.
Let's go, let's go.
You shouldn't cry now.
Now we're in war, and before we win... we can't feel sorry for our enemies.
You should be with us body and soul.
We are doing the right thing.
Hello, hello.
- Maybe you'd like some tea?
- I don't feel like it.
Why is he here?
Listen, give me the horse.
- Have you seen my folks?
- No, I haven't.
Go on, sew.
Boy, what's wrong with you?
Master, his legs are broken.
What a hell.
Master, what should we do now?
If he dies, I'll die, too.
Why are you talking about the horse and yourself, when all of Russia is crying?
The entire Russian nation doesn't spare the power and lives of its best sons in the great heroic war to defend our Motherland.
Russia will come out of that great struggle revitalized and strengthened.
It's not the time for despair, when our hearts are full of joy, and the idea of victory near.
The victory is close, victory only.
Hit the Germans, defeat the Germans... complete and definite victory.
We'll get you out of this dirty hole.
There is no other way.
Mail.
You've got mail.
"To Peter Ivan Gadkin"... for me.
"Dear Peter Ivanovich, with deep sympathy, we inform you that your older son,
Nikolai Petrovich, is in the hospital with minor injuries and your younger son,
Semyon Petrovich, was killed during an attack".
# When the soldiers march through town #
# The girls will open windows and doors... #
Stop singing.
I told you to stop!
What did you do?
Get out!
Get out of here!
Get out!
Get out of here!
I'm talking to you.
Get out.
Hit the Germans!
Beat the Germans!
Beat him!
Beat the Germans!
Stop, scoundrels.
So what if he is German?
He's still a shoemaker like us.
What do you want?
You should disperse.
Go, go.
My Senka was killed.
Take him to the bed.
Move, move.
He's not permitted to go out anymore, since it causes a big ruckus.
Go away, go away.
Pick him up.
Anka, come home, you brat!
I was knocked down... simply because I'm German.
Then a girl came, she was nice to me.
If it hadn't been for her, they would have killed me.
Compatriots, have you heard?
Our Tsar has abdicated.
- You're lying.
- Who's lying?
What a rush!
What a rush!
Brothers, friends, citizens... the rising sun of revolution has destroyed the tyranny.
Hello,
Alexander Feodorovich.
I don't have time,
I don't have time.
I greet you on behalf of the Provisional Government.
Free citizens of free Russia, hurrah!
Now the Duma of people will govern.
Duma...
To hell with the Tsar.
We can assume that there will be no war anymore.
We can assume that from the landowners... the land...
What a rush!
War is over.
The land will be...
Attack.
Well... okay, attack.
Fire, fire!
Brothers... when will this be over?
Don't save me.
I have a wife and child at home.
I think he doesn't want to fight.
No, he doesn't.
Explain to me, my dear... we don't want to fight, they don't want to fight, but still, this is the fourth year that we've been fighting.
Where are you going,
Nikolai?
Let me talk.
Every scoundrel,
German agent,
Bolshevik, spy and traitor, is appealing for fraternization on the front.
At this very moment, when the country, covered in blood, is fighting against the external enemies, the Bolsheviks betray the Motherland.
The Bolsheviks disintegrate the army.
On behalf of the Provisional
Government, I declare...
- Shoot those scoundrels!
- Don't disturb me, let me talk.
On behalf of the Provisional
Government, I declare, with no mercy, we will destroy soldiers, traitors calling for fraternization and disintegration of the army.
Nikolai!
Nikolai!
Nikolai!
Artillery, shoot the traitor of the Motherland.
Shoot!
My dear Nikolai...
Don't give rifles to the commanders.
Deputies, soldiers... the Winter Palace has been captured.
Anka!
Sit down and play!
Stop!
What's the matter?
- We've arrived, get off.
- Go to hell!
- I told you, we've arrived!
- I won't get off.
We kindly request you to get off.
- I'm submitting to violence.
- As you should! Peter, arrest him!
Get up.
Get up.
Get up, Kolya.
Kolechka.
Kolechka!
Kolya.
- What do you want?
- Get up.
Now.
What a rush!

- Morning report, sir.
- Good morning, Mac.
Have you heard anything from A-flight, sir?
Not yet.
Hello.
Hello?
Are you there?
Yes, Major Brand speaking.
Hello? Yes.
No, no, the flight isn't back yet.
You expect to send men out on a filthy job and have them back in no time at all?
What's that?
Next time you'll get someone else to do it?
'What do you wanna get someone else for?'
'Haven't we done every nasty job you can think of?'
If my men can't do it,
I'd like to do who can?
We're the best squadron in France.
Yes and furthermore, let me tell you something.
Hello? Hello?
The vicious, over-dressed brass hat.
Orders, orders.
Thinks the 59th can't do it, eh?
Well, the 59th can do anything he can think of.
It is a slaughter house, that's what it is.
And I'm the executioner.
You're too fond of calling yourself names, Brand.
- 'Now, if I were you--'
- See here, Phipps.
Do you know how many men we've lost in the last fortnight?
Sixteen men, that's what.
Think of that. Over a man a day.
And now there's A-flight out on a rotten show.
Seven splendid chaps.
Three of them first time over the lines.
If half get back we're lucky.
I know it's a rotten job, Brand but you shouldn't take it so seriously.
Hello?
Hello, yes, speaking.
Yes, what?
What?
A-flight? Two enemy patrols?
Who's down?
What? Five men!
What? You can't tell!
Hello? Hello?
You know, Phipps, someone picks up a phone and says "Bombers after a bridge. Protect them."
You say alright. Cheerio.
And send up a flight equipped with inferior planes.
They don't argue or revolt.
They say righto.
Then go out and do it.
They're stout fellas, aren't they?
Bott?
Yes, sir.
Another bottle.
Yes, sir.
Beg pardon, sir.
But you've heard of A-flight, sir?
Yes.
Five.
Five out of seven.
- Alright, sir.
- Alright, mac.
Fine. I'm glad you're back, sir.
- How did you make it, Scotto?
- Thanks, alright.
- And you?
- Alright.
- Hell, wasn't it?
- Right.
- Cigarette?
- Yes. Got a match?
Hello!
Shrapnel.
Almost blew my plane over.
Just five inches from your behind, sir.
Yes. But what a difference five inches made to me.
Oh!
Who did we lose?
Two of the new men.
Blaine and Machen.
There's Hollister.
I'm sorry for Hollister.
Machen was his best friend.
What a rotten war!
Where's Machen?
Have you seen Machen?
Courtney, where's Machen?
Bob hasn't come back.
Bob...Bob didn't come back.
Steady, Hollister, steady.
He..
He isn't..
...gone?
No, no. That couldn't have been Bob.
It couldn't have been Bob.
He never what happened.
There wasn't any pain.
Oh, come on, now, there's a good lad.
Come, come. Come on.
Steady, boy.
'Must feel quite bad.'
I'm alright, sir.
Quite alright.
You better have a drink,
Hollister.
No. No, I-I couldn't.
I'm not drinking.
- Go up with him, fellows.
- Right.
Machen gone West, sir?
Yes and Blaine too.
It's too bad.
First time over the lines too, huh?
- Hmm.
- 'Anything I can do?'
No. I'll be alright.
He's been a bit sick, sir.
Alright, fellas.
Here, Hollister, take this.
You'll find it'll help.
No, thanks. I'm alright.
Go on take it.
Shove it down now.
Bottoms up.
- Feel better?
- Yes, sir.
It does help.
A little later, pack Machen's things.
He didn't have time to unpack.
- Well, Courtney?
- A squad/Escort returning.
We reached the bridge.
The bombers scored direct hits and wiped it out.
- 'Yes?'
- We lost two men.
Blaine and Machen.
Yes, I know.
- That's all.
- Wait a minute, Courtney.
Did you have to do it that way?
Why couldn't you have been more careful?
'You're responsible for those new men.'
Do you think I got into that hiney fleet on purpose?
We were out numbered and forced down low.
We had to fight our way out.
'Yes. I suppose.'
Do you think I enjoyed losing those two men?
Scattering them all over,
France?
Burning them up in worthless planes?
Oh, why don't you say what you're really thinking?
Tell me I am wrong.
Tell me I oughta give you better planes, better fliers.
Blame me for it. Why don't you?
Go ahead.
I'm not blaming anyone, Brand.
You think it's easier to sit and wait for men to come back?
Wait and wait?
You think that's easy?
'Easy to be the executioner?
I know what you're thinking.'
'Don't look at me like that accusing me, I'm not to blame.'
The whole army's on my neck.
This squadron has desperate work and I depend on you to help.
I wish they would chuck that fighting for a bit.
It all started over a girl while they were on leave in Paris.
Just a well you know..
- I know.
- Courtney won.
They've been at each others' throat ever since.
Yes, I know the things are different now.
It's responsibilities that's driving Brand putty.
He's gotten to the end of his tether's scouts.
His nerves are all frayed out.
Every time a kid's shot down he feels he's the executioner.
No, no. No, he doesn't hate Courtney.
He depends on Courtney.
Needs him.
That's why...well..
I better go in before they come to blows.
'I'm your superior officer and..'
I suppose that's all.
Hello? Hello?
Yes, speaking.
Yes. Flight's back and the job is finished.
Blew the whole thing up.
Did you expect us to do any more than that?
Yes.
We lost two men.
Yes. Only two.
Only two?
...and we weren't exactly standing still either.
'I saw you.'
No, I wasn't..
I'll have a whiskey.
Drink all you can, son.
This maybe the last.
What's the devil with a full belly, say I.
I know.
I say, Courtney, do you remember
Griggs at the 37th?
He was killed the other day over at Ellenville.
Wings came off an SC.
Too bad.
I'll never forget him at ground school on his solo flight.
He cracked up plenty of planes after that.
You remember when he pancaked on that house, one morning and found himself hanging upside down staring into the girl's bedroom?
She opened the window and bashed him in the eye.
'Heard of the new motors the French are using?'
- No, I haven't.
- I think I have a final..
'They have a wonderful climb.'
And very costly.
I've got one thing against them.
They're bad in the power dive.
I hear they rip the wings..
I was sittin' there and one of them almost fell on me.
'I don't suppose you would.'
Don't you ever get fed up with that tune?
Oh, why should I?
It's a jolly good tune.
I say, sing us a song, will you?
Yeah, do it, old chap.
Alright, Tommy.

Listen to them out there.
Bluffing themselves.
Pretending that death doesn't mean a thing to them.
Trying to live by just the minute.
The hour.
Pretending they don't care if they go up tomorrow and never come back.
There's one poor fellow who doesn't pretend.
'Who's that?'
Hollister.
He can't forget that his best friend went down in flames.
I saw him out there, a few minutes ago, staring.
Wondering what it's all about.
I'm afraid he's got the wind up.
He'll never fit.
He'll have to learn.
Oh, why talk about him.
I don't want to know his troubles.
Is there an E in "courageously," Brand?
Courageously?
Yes, of course.
I'm just sending a letter of sympathy to Mrs. Machen.
I'm puzzled over that word,
"courageously".
- It has an unfamiliar look.
- Unfamiliar.
Well, you've written it often enough.
'It'll break her heart no matter how it's spelt.'
Hello. Hello, yes, yes, Major Brand speaking.
'Yes.'
Oh, where am I going to get the men to do it?
What? They're on their way up now?
Yes, of course we'll do it.
If any men get back from filthy work like this, they'll be lucky.
Yes, I understand.
Goodbye.
That's rotten, isn't it?
Yes.
Six more men coming up to this hell.
That Courtney's got to take them up.
Courtney.
It's a funny world, Phipps when you can be annoyed into your grave almost by a man.
Yet tear yourself to pieces worrying about his safety.
Oh, I wouldn't say it was so strange, Brand.
It's just responsibility.
Have you seen a mother risk her life to save her child? then spank its bottoms soundly for getting itself into danger?
I've got to tell him to take up new replacements again.
He'll resent it.
He'll just stand there looking holes clear through me while I tell him.
Then he'll say, "Right".
Well, come along, Phipps.
Let's get at it.
Would you mind turning that off, Scott?
Right.
Okay. Quiet, lads.
Attention over there, please.
Orders for tomorrow morning.
Gentlemen, orders for tomorrow.
A flight on the early show over Ballay Sector.
We're making an advance.
'We're to patrol four kilometers behind to the enemy lines.'
'Strafe any reinforcements and munitions convoys.'
'That they bring up for counter attack.'
When the barrage starts,
B Flight will cover our observation ships and artillery.
You'll take up the details among yourselves later on.
That's all.
Did you say A flight?
Yes.
4:30 in the morning.
A flight is only five men.
Well, more replacements are on their way up.
They'll be here sometime tonight.
Are you saying we must go on a job with two inexperienced men?
Yes.
Those are the orders.
Right.
Well, what amuses you?
You win again, Brand.
He said "Right" just as you said he would.
You'll be over the same battery we were this morning.
Someday they'll get our range.
They keep at it long enough.
Undoubtedly.
'Farley, you and the others fly above us.'
He's flying fifth position, you take sixth.
'We'll be watching those observation ships'
'Yes, we better keep--'
'Well, what happened last time on a job like this.'
'That's why you look out on the bow??.'
'Check your ammunition.'
'We've been having trouble with those bugs lately.'
Yes, I remember off hand
I could get a..
We'll rendezvous at here.
- Five thousand feet.
- Five thousand at that.
I just see my own death riding in a chariot of fire.
One more, Bott.
Hey, fellows, look at Scotto.
A few drinks and he falls sound asleep.
Come on, ol' friend.
Wake up. Time to go to bed.
I want to sleep.
'Pick him up.
You'll save time, Courtney.'
Come on, you blighter.
Wake up.
Oh, come on.
Get on your feet here now.
Say goodnight to the gentlemen.
Goodnight to the gentlemen.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
'Tuck him in, Courtney.'
'Tell him a nice bedtime story.'
Splendid, old zealot.
Yeah, now wake up and go to bed.
You're getting heavier all the time.
I always did hate walking up those steps.
I don't know what you want to drink for.
You get as fuzzy as an owl.
Only you can't keep your eyes open.
I know. I always want to sleep.
What's the matter, old son?
Was thinking about Hollister.
I recommend a change of thought.
Pretty rough losing your best friend.
You know, Machen wasn't much older than your brother.
Yes.
Yes, Donnie is 17 now.
If this mess is over by the time he gets out of school.
You remember the time we went up to visit him?
Donnie thought he was quite a man when he had beer with us.
Yes and I remember when he was a baby.
Your mother let me fool him.
I dropped him on his head because he spoiled my new suit.
All that seems awfully far away now.
As if it had never happened.
'That out there is the only thing that's real.'
Wouldn't it be fun if we're back there again?
Imagine waking up in the morning not having a thing to do all day but to enjoy peace and quiet.
And to know absolutely that you..
...you're going to get back in your bed again that night.
Silly, isn't it?
Try a little more coffee, sir?
No, thanks.
Good morning.
Why didn't you wake me up?
After last night I thought you'll enjoy a few extra winks.
Thanks. I did. Oh!
Whoo! What a head.
Thanks, Bott.
New men come up yet?
No, Sergeant's bringing them in directly.
'Alright, gentlemen.
This way, please.'
Here they are now.
Just put your things down and be comfortable.
Look at them, Scotty.
Four youngsters.
Wonder if they brought their nursing bottles along?
New replacements, sir.
Very good, mac.
Well, here goes.
Good morning, gentlemen.
Good morning, sir.
I'm Courtney, skipper of A flight.
Russell, second lieutenant, sir.
Reporting from the pool for duty.
Oh, hello, Russell.
Oh, break off.
No formality here.
Thanks.
How many hours have you fellows had on combat?
- Mr. Burt.
- Nine.
- 'Cleaver.'
- 'Smythe.'
- 'Holloway.'
- 'Russell.'
- 'Blythe.'
- Seven and a half, sir.
Seven and a half.
'Yes, sir.'
I'll take Russell and Smythe.
Get in to your flying tongs right away. Change here.
We're going over the to strafe trenches in the Bullay Sector.
Bott..
Have a drink?
Just make sure it's little, old son.
There's one who does.
Some more glasses, Bott.
Russell? Smythe?
Have a drink?
Thanks.
Scott, Mr. Russell,
Mr. Smythe.
How do you do?
Mr. Thornburn and Mr. Willsy.
'How do you do?'
- Welcome to the flight.
- Cheerio.
'First time over the line, eh?'
Morning, fellows.
- Good morning.
- Morning, Courtney.
New replacements.
I'm taking Russell and Smythe.
This is Major Brand.
- How do you do, sir?
- Hello, Russell.
- Hello, Smythe.
- How are you, sir?
This job isn't easy, fellas.
I want you to follow Captain
Courtney's orders closely.
'You stick to his tail, he'll get you through alright.'
'If you're forced down on the other side, destroy your plane.'
'Don't give any information except your name and Corp.'
Yes, sir.
That's all.
Happy landings, fellas.
- Thanks.
- Let's be off.
Sergeant.
Mr. Russell and Smythe are flying four and five.
Yes, sir.
This way gentlemen.
- Cheerio.
- Thank you, sir.
Oh, Hollister.
You're an old hand now.
We're counting on you.
Right.
Watch him.
Remember, you're protecting the tail.
- Righto.
- Hey, Scotty..
And watch yourself too, old man.
That goes for you too, old friend.
- Good morning, Mac.
- Good morning, sir.
- Flight's alright?
- Tip top, sir.
Contact.
Has the officers got any papers on his person that might give information to the enemy?
Has the officer got any papers on his person that might give information to the enemy?
Happy landing, sir.
Not, Mr. Scott, sir?
He was trying..
Scott was trying to help me.
He got me along and..
...suddenly the Boche came.
He as trying to help me get away and--
Blubbering can't help matters.
You're alright, aren't you?
Well..
We broke up the counterattack for an hour.
Then the Heinies found us.
We lost Smythe...
Wilson..
...and Scott.
- I'm awfully sorry, sir, I--
- Thanks, Bott.
Yes.
Can I do anything, old man?
You can...
Have a drink.
Thanks, I will.
What happened?
Well, after the first barrage, we were.. working under a cloud bank, strafing a convoy.
Focus?? dropped down on us and knocked down Smythe before he could even fire a shot.
I didn't even see Rosie go.
Then Hollister funked.
Got into a jam.
And Scott went after him..
That Jerry and shot him out of control.
Are you sure?
Yes, his tail surfaces were shot away.
He was only a little way below me and..
As he went into a spin, he waved goodbye.
Go ahead and play it.
What does it matter?
And then what, Courtney?
Well, I went bullheaded for the Jerry that got Scott.
I put a bullet in his motor.
Where'd he go down?
Somewhere behind our lines.
Some others got after me.
I was so busy I didn't even see where Scott fell.
I just happened to think..
Scott was wearing those... red polka dot pajamas.
What a shock that'll give the devil.
Alright, bring him in.
Oh, sergeant, you can send that car back.
'Yes, sir.'
- Just wait here.
- Yes, sir.
Major, artillery car just brought in a German aviator.
Where was he captured?
'They say...leader of A Flight brought him down.
'That's you, Courtney.'
Steady, old man.
- Bring him here.
- Alright.
Come along now.
Hauptmann Von Mueller.
Captain Von Mueller,
Major Brand.
'And Captain Courtney.'
Phipps, tell him Courtney is the man that shot him down.
He says he's delighted to meet you.
Ask him if he wants a drink.
Prost.

Blaine, Smythe, Machen.
My best friend Machen.
He's dead!
You hear me? He's dead!
Scott.. Scott tried to help me, he's dead too.
'They're all dead!'
'And they're not coming back anymore.'
And you laugh and sing...
Machen and Scott.
Scott!
- You killed Scott!
- Huh?
'Yes, you!
You tried to kill me.'
You tried to kill all of us!
And you... you can drink with him!
You can laugh with him..

I'm sorry.
I lost my head.
But you're new up here,

You have a lot to learn.

I'm sorry.
'You wait out here and I'll be back in a few minutes.'
Cheerio!
- 'Why, it's Scotty!'
- Look who's here..
'Hold on, hold on.
Anybody think of the king.'
Boy, I'm in a delicate condition, wait a minute.
- Hello, Scott-o,
- Hello, son.
You're just in time.
We were celebrating your wake.
Oh, I've gotta be here for that.
Can't have a wake without a corpse, can you?
Tell me.
What in the world ever happened to you?
Well, I got a whole load of bullet.
The last thing I remember was pancaking into a trench and watching my wings fold up.
And then I woke up with a bump on my head...Feel it?
And a stretcher bearer pouring rum down my throat..
We should have some of that rum.
- You didn't take any, did you?
- No, no, just a spot.
But I stopped at all the pubs on the way back.
I brought a surprise for you.
Come on, open them up! and go right on the..
Oh, what's that?
That's the man who shot you down.
The what, the who?
Phipps, introduce them.
How do I get rid of the blighter?
Ask him to have a drink.
Will you have a drink?
- Yeah?
- Yah!
- Goodbye!
- Goodbye.
You're not gonna go and break up your own wake.
Yes. We've got a car and a chauffeur and we're gonna see France.
Hello, Flaherty.
Court, this is Flaherty.
How are you, Flaherty?
Best driver on the western front. Good singer too.
We sang all the way home, didn't we?
You know the words on part of Plum And Apple?
Yes.
Fine.
We'll all sing it together.

Beg pardon, sir.
But ain't it time
B flight was back?
Yes, Bott.
'Alright.'
Watch it, pal.
That's right. That's right.
- They winged me, Courtney.
- Too bad, old man.
- I'll take him home.
- Yes, sir.
'What a bloomin' mess they've been in.'
'A nasty mess I calls it.
Like a little rubbish.'
It's a rotten scene, old boy.
Come on now.
Help him out with his things, gents.
- Steady, old man.
- Easy, fellows.
Come on.
Can you move your right arm?
Here you are, Spires.
It'll fix you up.
'What happened?'
We've got visitors, Brand.
'What do you mean?'
I mean, Von Richter's moved in across the line.
- Von Richter?
- Yes.
We ran into one flight, then another.
Suddenly the air was filled with them.
What a mess!
It's lucky any of us got back alive.
'Get it inside the bandage.'
What fliers they are.
We didn't have a chance.
Out numbered, four to one.
They got Thornburn and Barton.
And Hollister.
A damn shame.
Does your face hurt,
Squires?
No, just a splinter from the windshield.
That means blighty for you.
Take him over to the M.O.
Shall I send you back some hops to play with?
Squires..
Tell me, Hollister..
...how did he die?
He was trying to help Thornburn.
He died like a man.
Oh, I'm glad.
I'm glad.
'Get cover! Jerry up!'
...:::Lord Sadler:::... lordsadler2012@gmail.com
Boots?
- Why, George, that's queer.
- What does he want?
Say, Courtney, what is it?
"One pair of trench boots
"for the use of British flying officers.
Signed Von Richter."
Damn him!
- You can give those boots.
- I'll keep them.
- I want them.
- Just a minute, me lads.
'Hold on.'
There's gonna be no voluntary patrols.
Don't you lads realize that those boots are just a trick to get you up into the air?
None of you are gonna commit suicide by going out alone.
You'll die soon enough.
Not a man leaves the ground without my orders.
Understand?
Now, listen to me.
Service both planes.
Rig them up with bomb racks.
Look the guns over extra special.
Don't start before midnight.
And if any of you blokes make a noise or show a light..
...I'll knock your bloomin' heads off.
Understand?
You're going home.
Somebody's gonna get hell for this.
Who from?
The major, of course.
Oh, I thought you meant Von Richter.
Ah, let's hop it and get 'em ready.
- Morning, Mac.
- Everything is ready, sir.
Good.
- Give them hell, Scotto.
- Right-o, son
Beg your pardon, sir.
I've been saving this up since Neueve Chappelle.
Would you mind dropping it on their head with my compliments, sir?
- Alright, Ackroyd.
- Thank you, sir.
Here are the boots, sir.
Thank you, Mac.
Make it quick, sir.
I'm gonna have tea and strawberry jam waiting for you when you come back.
- Happy landing, sir.
- Thank you, Mac.
'Contact.'
'Get down here with those planes, damn you!'
Didn't you hear my orders?
I'll break your necks!
You can keep the boots!
Right here, Scotto!
Take her up, Scotto. Gotta get back to strawberry jam.
Fire!
What's the matter, Scotto?
Can't see.
Oil in my eye.
Get her high!
We're going down!
Alright. We're out of it.
Keep going.
We are almost down.
Wing out. Let 'em hit.
Scott, look out!
Scotto...are you alright?
Yes, I'm alright.
I got you, son.
I can't see. Oil.
Give me something, quick.
Okay, that's better.
Well, we made it, didn't we?
Maybe he's right.
We better go.
You were certainly right about that front-line rum.
Courtney and Scott have just returned.
Came in a French staff car.
'Do you want to see Courtney now?'
Yes. Send him in.
Right.
Courtney.
Wanted to see me?
You think you're gonna get away with this, Courtney, eh?
'Well, you think wrong this time.'
'You disobeyed my direct orders.'
You think I issued them to hear myself talk?
You went out against
Von Richter.
Von Richter, do you understand?
When we're outnumbered four to one.
You fool, we need every man.
Every plane.
And you went out and smashed two of 'em.
I'm gonna have you court martialed for this.
I'm gonna break you out of the Flying Corp.
And when I've finished with you,
Courtney, you'll wish that you..
Hello...yes, speaking.
'Yes.'
What?
Who?
Right.
Right, thanks.
I've got you, Courtney.
I've got you just where I want you.
You've refused responsibility.
Flown wild.
Disobeyed orders. Blamed me.
Accused me of putting kids in canvas coffins, eh?
Well, I've just been transferred up to wing.
'And they've appointed someone in my place.'
- 'In my place, understand?'
- What?
And that someone is going to be you.
And see how you like it,
Mr. Squadron Commander.
Hello? Hello.
Speak louder, will you?
I can't hear you. What?
Well, let the infantry get demoralized
I can't put planes over them.
Six replacements?
Replacements? More kids.
You're making a death house of this place.
Von Richter's squadron just shot us out of the air.
Driven us into the ground.
Killed our best men.
You expect green kids to stop him?
Right, it'll be done. But I tell you, they won't have a chance.
Brass hats, sitting back there on easy chairs and making excuses for sending men up to die.
No use trying to reason with them, Courtney.
Well, how about getting on with this letter.
Where did we leave off?
'"And I can only hope,
Mrs. Blythe, that.."'
I can only hope, Mrs. Blythe..
...it will give you some measure of comfort to know that..
...your son died in combat.
Fighting valiantly.
You know, Phipps, I will never forget that boy.
I asked him how many hours he'd had.
He said, "Seven and a half."
And they keep sending more up like him.
Kids against Von Richter.
'Anything more to add to this?'
No, finish it yourself.
What does it matter?
Come in.
Hello, Carl.
Hello, Scotto.
Court, don't you think you've had enough of that?
That's my business.
Oh..
Sorry, Scotto,
I shouldn't have said that.
I'm getting jumpy.
Nerves aren't what they used to be.
That's alright, old son.
I am rather jumpy myself.
Can't get used to being alone in flight.
I am always wishing that you were along.
Yes, I wish I were too.
Better than sitting here.
Come in.
- What is it, Mac?
- Well, new men outside, sir.
More lambs for the slaughter.
Fix them up, will you, Scotto?
Make them as comfortable as you can.
Right. Come along, Mac.
I'm Scott.
Skipper of A flight.
At ease, gentlemen.
No formality here.
Billing. Second lieutenant, sir.
Reporting from the pool for duty.
Right.
Billings, Moorhead, Gregory go to the first house on your left.
- That'll be your quarters.
- Right, sir.
- Night.
- G'night.
"Ranson, Jones, Ca.."
- Donnie!
- Scotty.
Aren't you glad to see me?
But I...I thought you were in school, old man.
Oh, I couldn't stand not being in it any longer.
So I left and enlisted.
Went through ground school in four weeks.
Oh, that's-that's grand.
Mac, this is my brother.
- Your brother, sir?
- Yes.
Show the other gentlemen to their quarters, Mac?
This way gentlemen.
You always thought
I was a kid, Scotty.
I'm going to prove to you, I am not.
That's right.
You...you are a man...now.
Wait till you see me fly out there.
I passed combat maneuvers perfectly.
Well, that's...that's splendid.
- Is Court around?
- Yes.
Let's go see him later.
Come on,
I-I'll show you your quarter.
Alright.
See, isn't this..
Hello? Hello, yes, speaking.
What's that?
Wait a moment.
Alright, go ahead.
What?
'Yes, go on.'
'Four patrols a day.'
I can't do that.
I can't do it, I tell you.
The lot of green men will be wiped out.
Alright. Will do it.
Right.
Before the week is out, Phipps..
...you'll see the end of Squadron 59.
There isn't an end to anything,
Courtney.
It just goes on and on.
We'll be under everything that flies.
Cold mutton.
Well, ready for orders.
'Yes.'
Settle down, will you?
Gents. Quiet, lads.
Quiet please.
Orders for tomorrow.
Orders, fellows.
There's no need for secrecy.
JHQ has found that Fritz starts the big push day after tomorrow.
They're starting minor advances now.
More patrol in the Mantes Wood sector. opposite the German 6 army.
We'll have to fly four patrols a day.
And every man goes into the air at dawn tomorrow.
'This means you'll have to do all the dirty work.'
Machine gunning infantry. Flying low. Stopping supply trucks.
And any shock troops they may try to bring up.
You will be pitted against
Von Richter.
'You'll be flying below enemy patrols.'
'You'll have to watch out.'
That's all.
Court.
Donnie.
Hello, Court, it's great to see you.
So you are one of the replacements?
Yes. Didn't expect me, did you?
Scotty was surprised too.
Oh, it's great to be up here with you both.
And just think,
I'll go up tomorrow. Won't I?
Yes.
Just a minute, Donnie.
You're not gonna send this kid up in the air?
- Hold on, Scott.
- Hold on nothing.
If you think
I am gonna take him up against Von Richter, you're barmy.
Flier, ground school, he doesn't know what it's all about.
What chance would he have?
As much chance as any of the others.
I'm sorry. It's orders.
We're all on the same boat.
I can't make exceptions.
- But, Scotty--
- Shut up.
I won't take him up.
I said every man in the air.
And you were the one who talked about sending a school--
Quiet!
Those are orders, you hear me?
Orders. Now get out!
Get out, I tell you.
Right.
- But, but--
- That's enough.
You be ready at dawn tomorrow.
That's all.
Yes, sir.
Come in.
Sit down, Donnie.
I am sorry I spoke that way.
Oh, that's quite alright.
I don't think you need to worry about me.
You see, Scotty really doesn't know how well I can fly.
He can't realize that, that I've grown up.
Scotty is right, Donnie.
You learned how to fly.
But things are different up here.
Scotty knows that.
Knows what you're up against.
And I think that you should know it too.
Now, you are going out there against veterans.
Superb fliers like Von Richter.
You've got to be on you mettle every moment.
Remember every trick you've learned.
And, Donnie, if you should lose..
...be a good loser.
Just as you would be in school.
I know what you are trying to say, Court.
You mean, that tomorrow
I may not come back.
That I may die.
That's it, isn't it?
Well, none of us will be here long, Donnie someday I'll go just like the rest.
But it really isn't so bad if when you go you know that you've done all you could to help.
Oh, it would be splendid to go like that.
I'm not afraid, Court.
Really. I'll come back.
I can fight better than you think.
Right.
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
Oh, I say..
...perhaps I'd better leave this with you if you don't mind.
In case anything should happen.
'I got it for being on the crew last year.'
Silly, but it's rather precious to me.
Of course.
Thanks.
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight, Court.
Fly in second position on my right.
Stick close, Donnie, and I'll try and get you through.
Don't worry.
I'm not a bit afraid.
Really, you watch me.
I can fly better than you think.
Good, boy. Cheerio!
In you get.
'How many, Phipps?'
Three.
No, Donnie.
Donnie, no!
Donnie, no!
Donnie, no, no, no!
Two?
The match was wrong, Phipps.
Yeah.
He's dead.
He's dead.
Went down in flames.
'You sent him there, you dirty butcher!'
- Scott-o--
- 'None of that, Courtney.'
From now on you're just a drunken sack/sap?? in command.
You sent that kid up there without a chance.
You even told him how to die.
How rotten.
Told my brother how to die.
Scotty!
- Hello, Phipps.
- Hello, Brand.
Is it really you?
By again!
You're looking a new man.
Thanks. I feel like one.
- I missed you, Phipps.
- Very nice of you to say that.
Courtney inside?
- Yes.
- Right.
- This is Mr. Sterling, Phipps.
- Hello. How are you?
How do you do?
Come in.
Hello, Courtney.
How are you, Brand?
'Fine, thank you.
It's nice to see you.'
Pull up a chair.
- Have a drink?
- Thanks. I will.
That's enough.
Well, the place looks about the same.
Yes. About the same.
I never expected you wanted to see it again.
What brought you?
'General sent me.'
Oh! Then I can expect some pleasant news this time.
Well, what is it?
You've been having a rotten time, Courtney, haven't you?
I know exactly how you feel about it.
The old man says that you've been raising the very devil objecting to his orders.
This job is far too important to talk about over the phone.
What is it?
The enemy start their big push day after tomorrow at dawn.
Now the ammunition and supplies have been concentrated at railhead at Sule.
And the destruction of that railhead will stop their drive.
'And it's up to your squadron to destroy it.'
Well, you're barmy, Brand.
Sule is 60 kilometers over the lines.
If four flight got half that far the whole German Air Force will attack.
Right! A flight couldn't make it.
It's up to one man, to go in alone, at dusk.
You've to take a chance on getting there before they can stop it.
- I say it can't be done.
- 'It has to be done.'
The man who goes will set a dog's chance of getting back.
'Then you refuse?'
Well, there's no refusal.
I'll go myself.
Sorry, Courtney.
You're chained to this desk just as I was.
You better ask for a volunteer.
'Here are the instructions.'
Right.
Gents..
Carry on.
Fellows..
...the enemy has concentrated munitions for the advance in a dump, 60 kilometers behind the line.
Our squadron is ordered to destroy it.
Now, there's no chance for a flight to get through.
'One man flying low, hedge-hopping might succeed.'
'The chances are ten-to-one that he won't come back.'
I'm not going to order anybody to do this job.
I want a volunteer.
- That job's mine.
- I'll take it.
- I'll fly, Courtney.
- Let me have it.
I spoke first, Courtney, do I get it?
Right.
You get it.
'Here are the instructions.
Read them carefully.'
You leave at dusk.
In exactly two hours.
Right.
Russell, see that sergeant gets his plane ready.
Yes, sir.
Right out.
Orders.
Orders!
Executioner Courtney.
Successor to Executioner Brand.
Well, you've got your volunteer.
Your job's gonna be done.
But it means that boy out there is going to die.
It means that Scotty is going to die.
Sorry, Courtney.
Yes?
Get out, Courtney!
Like it or not
I'm going over these maps with you.
I know what I am going to do.
I don't need to be told how to die.
I'm in command here.
You'll just sit there and listen to my orders.
I wouldn't drink that if I were you.
You had a lot already.
You can't stand much.
Can't I?
I know how much I can stand.
Well..
Get on with it.
You take this point.
You'll follow through the valley until you hit the railway.
Here.
Then East until you get there.
Now, here's Sule.
The big warehouses are right here at the railhead.
And ammunition are piled in this area here.
A hit anywhere in this vicinity will do it.
Sorry.
The enemy high patrol will be on it's way back at dusk.
You'll have to go in very low to avoid them.
One would think
I were green kid.
First lesson of them flying grounder school.
Your only chance is to reach it before they spot you.
Keep a lookout on the way over.
That place is alive with arches.
They'll phone ahead and you may run into a barrage.
But you'll have to keep on going.
Court...time to go yet?
No, you have a good hour.
I'll wake you when it's time.
- Yeah. Oh, Court.
- Yes?
Sorry. I understand.
Brass hats. Orders.
'I can't go out there still sore at you.'
'Can I?'
Why, of course not.
Now, go to sleep.
Go to sleep.
Happy landings, Scotto.
'Guns are alright, sergeant.'
'Very good.'
Aye, Mr. Scott will find this in good shape.
'Right, sergeant.'
'Sergeant.'
Hello, Mac.
But..
You're not flying, sir.
Yes, Mac.
Going West.
Get busy there.
- 'Switch off.'
- 'Switch off.'
- 'Gas on.'
- 'Gas on.'
'Duck in.'
- 'Contact.'
- Contact.
Happy landings, sir.
Thank you, Mac.
- Any news, Phipps?
- No.
- Have you?
- No.
I've phoned wing headquarters and observation posts at Mantes.
Haven't heard a thing.
We must do something, Phipps.
We must do something!
Steady, lad, steady.
We've dug a trench in the field filled with petrol.
As soon as we hear his motor we'll light it to help him land.
- What more can we do?
- I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Why don't you realize Courtney's out there alone.
Without me. Doing the thing
I should've done.
Oh, God!
Come along, my lad, come along.
We'll wait outside.
We've petrolled the width of the field, sir.
Plenty of light to land by when he comes.
Right.
I'm afraid it's no use, Mac.
'Oh ,don't say that, sir.'
'Listen!'
- 'I hear the motor.'
- 'It's him!'
Light the petrol!
Light the petrol!
Off with it!
Open it!
Back from the trench!
- That's a German plane.
- Look out everybody!
Got incoming!
'He dropped something.'
Here's the package he dropped, sir.
What's that mean?
It means..
The gallant gentleman died this afternoon.
Goodbye..
...old son.
Do you mind turning that off, please.
- Righto!
- Thanks.
Quiet, lads.
Attention over there, please.
Orders for tomorrow.
Orders, fellows.
You'll be glad to know that our squadron has received special mention for his part in checking the enemy advance.
A flight ready to take off at dawn to patrol the mass sector of 3500 meters.
There'll be new men up tonight to fill in the necessary replacements.
...:::Lord Sadler:::... lordsadler2012@gmail.com
Newspaper.
- Is it true? 
- Look yourself, sir.
"Following the success of our U-boats it has been decided ..."
So now we know, sir.
Reception!
- ... I want a room 
- A room for my wife and myself.
Sorry, we are full.
- But we just got married. 
- He has to join the ship tomorrow!
29, but I might turn you out.
Register first!
¿Captain Hardt?
You'll need a diving suit. He is still at sea.
- The U29 moored an hour ago, sir. 
- Who would be a U-boat captain?
- A letter arrives, send it to my room. 
- Very good.
- Capt Rigg wants another manicure, room 46. 
- I know...
Well?
Captain Hardt is to report to headquarters immediately.
- He hasn't arrived yet. 
- What's his room number?
- Have you seen him?
Not for 16 days.
- You know him by sight?
- No.
Well, try the Turkish baths at Koernische.
Koernische Strasse ...
- Hullo; kept my room? 
- 54, Captain Hardt.
- Cigarettes? 
- Sorry, Capt. We're sold out.
- Again? 
- Got yet tobacco.
And a beautiful pipe. Only six marks.
Nothing doing it. I never smoke a pipe.
- C'mon, lets bath and shape the body. 
- Did you sink any food ships?
- Four. 
- Makes me hungry just to think of it.
16 days without a smoke.
- This is absolutely ... 
- Perfect!
Food first. A cigar is best after dinner.
You're always right, sir.
Back again, Captain. Congratulations.
- A table for two? 
- And a meal for ten.
I put in the out booth. They've just gone.
- Felix, darling! 
- After dinner, Schatzchen.
Listen Hans: We've been 16 days in a submarine.
It makes 48 tins of sardines, 768 beastly little fishes.
- I could eat a horse.
- He probably did.
Sorry, it's a meatless day.
We'll have roast goose with foie gras,
- Apple pie, plum pudding. 
- Big as a depth charge.
Gentlemen... please!
- Here is the menu. 
- Thank you.
- Is it a joke? 
- Boiled fish!
- Carrots, beets, potatoes. 
- No potatoes, sir!
- Bring a pail of bread and butter. 
- No butter. Margarine tomorrow perhaps.
We sank the finest food in the world
Then turn to port and you give us ...
- Boiled fish and carrots! 
- I agree...
Fifth floor.
Captain Hardt? Message from headquarters. Report immediately.
- Carry on as she goes, quartermaster. 
- As she goes, sir.
What an idea, putting a motorbike in a submarine!
- Can at least open the kit pack?
What it says about the motorbike, sir?
- What you got there? 
- A chart of the mine defences.
And a photograph of the Old Man of Hoy; it seems to be a rendez-vous.
3* 25'. It's off my chart.
- It's in mine. 
- Here.
Gentlemen, we are on a special mission.
Our orders are to proceed to
Scapa Flow in the Orkney Islands.
It's a big job and a dangerous one. 
I know I can count on you.
That's all. Thank you.
Hartman, full speed ahead.
- 3-2-0, sir.
- Schuster? 
- Yes, sir.
"Your" motorbike, it'll take me to Longhope, in the island of Hoy, base of the British Grand Fleet.
"Once across the minefield, spend the night at the Man of Hoy."
Lt. Schuster will take over and wait for your return.
You will proceed to the Longhope School where you will report to our agent... 
Fraulein Thiel. "
A woman? How is she?
- Tall, dark, 21... 
- My type, sir!
- Have a shave, sir. 
- See what's in the kit pack.
- I still do not see why a motorcycle. 
- Schuster ...
A man landed from a submarine would not travel by motorbike.
- Ah, camouflage! 
- Ah, camouflage.
A well-worn tweed, the thing for Scotland.
Too big for me; fits you all right.
This suit's mine! I bought it in Berlin.
"Temple & Conway, Saville Row, London"
"Ernest H-A-R-T"
Your name, sir, spelled in the English way.
Clever. Stole my own suit. 
Trying to make a spy of me.
This Fraulein Thiel; is there a photograph of her?
- How would they get her into the school? 
- That's their business.
Miss Anne, dear, it is nearly four.
- The carrier will be here. 
- Coming!
Look out!
- My poor paint... 
- The handle broke.
Oh, there's nothing hurt.
Nanny dear, I've loved my holiday, every minute.
How couldn't I know to look after your? 
I have plenty of practice.
Don't stand there smiling, fix a label.
I thought you might like to have this.
You dropped your passport, Miss Butter Fingers.
- It's a photo of John and me. 
- And you give it to me?
- I have lots more. They printed thousands. 
- Beautiful!
"Rvd. John Harris, vicar of St. Swithin's,"
"and his fiancee, Miss Anne Burnett,"
"who was appointed to the school at Orkney Islands..."
- You'll miss him, deary. 
- Oh, he's going come see me when he got a leave.
A car has stopped at the gate!
Would it be too much to ask for some tea?
It suits me, but you'll have to wait until this lady is under way. Maggie, the bag.
- We're waiting for the carrier. 
- To take the train to Thurston. Excuse me a minute.
- Are you going up north? 
- To the Orkney Islands.
- Where the fleet is, right? 
- Got a job there. I'm a teacher.
- It's four o'clock! 
- My train leaves at five!
How strange Sandy Ross being late. 
- Sandy Ross?
- Have you seen him?
We saw an old car with his name. 
He seemed to be broken down.
- Where? 
- About 8 km.
- God! 
- Can't catch another train?
Missing the boat would mean losing a whole day!
Tell Mr. McLeod! We'll take the hearse.
No. Wait.
- I can run you to the station. 
- It would be lovely.
- What about your tea? 
- It doesn't matter.
- The Providence sent you. 
- Come along.
Maggie, put her things in the car!
We're taking her to Dingwall.
Be sure to keep warm. She's easy to catch a cold!
You're a blessing in disguise.
Hold your dear passport. Don't forget your woolies.
- It's terribly cold out there. 
- I'll take care.
- Never thought you were a teacher. 
- But I am.
- I got my degree from Bristol U. 
- Then again...
Had to do something after my father died. No money.
- What was your father? 
- He was an architect, but not very lucky.
He only had a good job; a tavern in Chester.
And he didn't like it because he was a teetotaler.
- You lived in Chester? 
- Yes, on Putnam Street.
- The Orkney Islands; do you have friends there? 
- None.
- But John will come to see me. 
- Who is John?
My fiance. Want to see a photograph?
Very much.
He is quite good looking.
Orkney Islands; I thought it was impossible for civilians to go there.
It is. It was a fuzz getting my passport.
- But you got it? 
- Yes, here it is.
Complete with photograph. Isn't it terrible?
- Passport photographs are never flattering. 
- Haven't you taken the wrong road?
- ¿Is this the route to Dingwall, Edwards?
- Yes, madam.
It probably is a shortcut.
- Are you sure you aren't cold? 
- No, I love it.
Remember what your nanny said. 
Give Miss Burnett the shetland scarf.
- Really I don't want it. 
- No, you mustn't catch cold.
- Done? 
- All is in order.
Well, hold on tight.
Put on these clothes.
- Did you see a light? 
- Where? No.
- I think I heard a splash. 
- Take over.
A seagull.
Right, madam. We know you.
- ¿Miss Anne Burnett? 
- Yes.
- Schoolteacher?
- Yes.
- This picture, it doesn't really do you justice. 
- I tought it as good as my other passport photos.
- Destination?
- Longhope.
- Age?
- Married or single? 
- Engaged.
- Pass... 
- Thank you.
- What about tea, Miss? 
- Yes, please.
- What time we get to Longhope?
 - In about an hour, Miss.
- You're only passenger 'cept for a telephone linesman.
- Thank you.
Fix your pass there.
- Are you in the wire patrol? 
- What do you think?
- Six? 
- Six.
I'll pass you.
- Fine passage, James? 
- You think so, Walter?
For you. All you do is stand on the bridge, but me?
It is a miracle that I keep this old tub coming.
When will we be in port to see them?
- I'll see about that.
- I hope so.
- You're the new teacher?
- Yes.
It'll be a nice change from the last one. 
She was called "Wall Eyed Maggie".
- You got a pass?
- Yes.
I'm a special constable, you understand?
See that? "Orkney Constabulary", for the duration.
No one's up or down without me knowing.
- Miss Anne Burnett?
- Yes.
I'll pass you.
Bob Bratt. Come; there's a minister and his wife who want to meet you.
- Thank you.
- I'll take it.
- Shut that door!
- All right, Pier Master!
This is Rvd. Hector Matthews. My wife.
- How kind to meet me.
- Welcome to Longhope.
We were thinking, you may prefer a room with us
- To living up at the school house.
- That's very kind, but ...
We thought it'd be highly improper for so young a girl to be on her own.
- I'm accustomed to look after myself.
- Mrs Matthews is a pretty housekeeper.
- You'll find the charge is very reasonable.
- I'm sure of that.
Shall we discuss it some other time?
Good bye.
- Good bye.
- I'll put you on your road, Miss Burnett.
- Shut that door!
- All right, Pier Master!
- 50 feet.
- Pump up 4 auxiliary.
Pump up 4 auxiliary!
- Dead slow.
- Dead slow, sir.
Stop the pump. Shut 4 auxiliary.
Stop the pump, shut 4 auxiliary!
- 80 feet!
- Flood fives.
Flood fives!
Hold at 80 feet.
Hot? Funny how cold makes you steam.
- We have scraped something, have you heard?
- You would have heard if we had.
Well, gentlemen, I think we are through.
Whoever got the chart of the mine field deserves the Iron Cross.
Yes, we shouldn't have even a wood one without it.
Stop motors.
Stopped boat, sir!
Can you hear anything?
No, sir. Nothing.
- Good. I'm going up. 30 feet.
- 30 feet, sir!
Up periscope.
- Stand by to surface.
- Stand by to surface!
- Main vents shut, sir!
- Blow ones.
- Blow twos and threes.
- Blow twos and threes!
- Stop blowing. Exit stations!
- We review the details?
- Do you think I'll forget?
To be sure. Ready? On top of the cliff?
- Northeast, surrounding rocks.
- Then?
Follow telegraph poles. Rough road.
- 3 miles?
- Right.
At the fork, turn left.
- In the cairn?
- Stop and look for the sign W-NW.
- The woman?
- Fraulein Thiel.
- Motorcycle is asshore, sir.
- Password?
I do not know what spell makes me so sad...
- What are you smiling at?
- You sir, saying that in the dark to a woman.
If you are so funny, keep it. Come on.
Come up at same time next 3 nights.
Yes, sir.
- Got everything you want?
- Yes.
- Glasses? ¿Gun?
- All.
Good luck.
Who goes there?
- Constable Bob Bratt.
- Pass.
Quiet tonight.
Hi there!
Put that light out!
- Is somebody calling?
- What you think you're doing showing a naked light?
- I'm very sorry.
- Put it out!
Yes.
- Haven't you read the regulations?
- No.
- All the worse. And you're a teacher!
- It's you, Mr. Bratt? I'm very sorry.
Well, that's all right, Miss.
I'm single handed and the fleet here, I have to keep an eye.
A spy would give his head to get here, but he won't get by Bob Bratt.
- Good night.
- Good night.
I do not know what spell makes me so sad.
An ancient legend duped me and not let me.
- What was the patrol doing?
- They saw the light.
- You're alone?
- Of course.
- Where this door leads?
- To the kitchen.
- Does the ladder?
- A room.
Butter!
You gave me a fright.
So you are Fraulein Thiel.
Yes, captain Hardt.
- From now on please speak in English.
- And eat in English?
- Come in.
- Thank you.
- How did you get here?
- A demure look and a fake passport.
You speak English like a native.
I shouldn't go very far. I am the teacher.
- Teacher!
- My name is Anne Burnett.
- Please call me that.
- Anne Burnett.
Are you mad? Wearing an uniform here?
If I'm shot, it will be as an officer, not a spy.
Being a civilian I have no such defenses.
I beg your pardon.
A whole ham, white bread... and butter.
- Butter!
- Butter.
These English are not feeling the pinch.
I had no idea secret agent's was such a comfortable profession.
It has its uncomfortable moments.
Talking about it, school opens the day after tomorrow.
- I wonder how I should get on.
- So do I.
In Germany girls no longer wear silk stockings.
I'll show you your room. It's upstairs.
- I haven't yet been told what I'm to do here.
- You'll be told tomorrow.
Not tomorrow. Now!
What are your orders?
- I beg your pardon?
- Your orders, Captain Hardt!
To report for duty to Fraulein Thiel and obey her orders.
Exactly! Pick up your motorbike and go to bed.
- Do I take it to bed with me?
- Suit yourself. There's a parking space at the wash den.
Sorry.
Good night.
Hey, hey! Why are you locking me in?
- A woman comes to clean in the morning.
- I can lock my own door.
I think this is safer.
- May I come in?
- Come in.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Your breakfast is in my room. 
There's a beautiful view from my window.
I didn't come here for holidays. I have more important things to do than admire the view.
All right!
Well... ¿The plan?
To sink 15 of these ships.
How?
He will tell you.
Who is he?
A British officer with a grudge. 
He was in command of a destroyer.
- He lost it in a collision.
- How?
A wrong order. He'd been drinking.
Traitor and drunkard, an honor for the British navy.
- Where did this happen?
- Off Cyprus.
- HMS Connaught. February 16.
- Then you knew?
- Of course. Commander Ashington.
- Lieutenant. He was dismissed of the ship.
- Where did you meet him?
 - At Leith, a month ago.
- And found he had a price.
- Rather a high one.
- Paid by whom? 
- Germany.
Only by Germany?
And me.
I suppose we should have to meet.
Come down in a minute.
Captain Hardt.
Suppose we'll sit down and get acquainted.
- Give him a drink; loosen him up a bit.
- I'd rather get to business.
Drink when you can in this job. That's my motto.
May we confine on what rests before us.
All alike, you Germans, one tech mind.
Draw the curtains, get the charts. Let's go.
Here we are. Three years we've been sitting on our bottoms in Keith.
- Met in Jutland.
- That's why you haven't put it out a notice since.
- You mean ... 
- All right, we both won.
Point is: with the fleet around the corner, and that the large fleet in Scapa watching,
- You couldn't get to the Irish Channel...
- I know that. What's your plan?
Two cruisers squadrons will sweep southward.
I know that too. It is routine.
But wouldn't you give an eye to know when, where & how?
- Do you know?
- Everything except the actual time, and I'll get it.
- Which squads? 
- The 1st and 5th.
And the course?
Here it is, pencil line. East of Swona.
If we got submarines to rendez-vous...
- In Sandwick Bay.
- In Sandwick Bay,
- We could bag the lot,
- Exactly.
They may alter the course, but I'll find out.
- From whom?
- My brother. He is flag captain.
- He too...? 
- No. It's a case of brotherly trust.
When will this movement take place?
Tomorrow. Next day. Anytime. 
But you'll get plenty of notice.
We can't take submarines off blockade duty on suppositions.
Supposition nothing! Those squadrons are going to sail.
- The date? 
- I'll get it.
It would be the biggest smash of the war.
Then, we understand each other?
I hope so.
- To our next meeting.
- To our next meeting.
Mind you, behave yourself.
- Mr Ashington, what is your ship?
- The old Warspite.
She won't be going out with the squad?
- She's laid out for repairs, as usual.
- Pity.
You see, children. When look at this little island of ours, you realize it is...
... the protector of much larger countries and continents.
I know you don't like it but this isn't for a German audience.
- You've almost persuade me to become British.
- What would I say next?
There's the bit about the empire where the sun never sets.
But it needs explain.
Which way it goes? West-East or East-West?
It worries me. I bet children will know.
I shouldn't worry. You can teach them more important things.
How to get to an island guarded like Gibraltar.
How to twist British and German officers round your little finger.
Lots of things never taught in school.
Doesn't all that belong to evening school for grown-ups?
It is evening, and I am a grown-up.
But you're not one of my pupils.
Tell me: what became of the real Miss Burnett?
- You know "Red Riding Hood"?
- It had a happy ending...
That's why this story is different.
- She met with an accident?
- Yes, an accident.
- Were you present?
- I obey orders in my service.
What a service!
Have you ever fire a torpedo on an unarmed ship?
- That's different!
- It's certainly more of the same.
Why do you look down on me?
I obey orders, as you obey yours.
We don't choose the jobs we do.
We are parts of a machine of destruction. Like it or not.
Where is the key?
Here.
Good night.
Thank you, children. That's very nice.
Now you may dismiss.
- Thank you very much. Good day.
- Good day.
- Any news? 
- I got it. They sail tomorrow.
- What time? 
- 7:00 a.m.
- No changes?
- No changes.
- You get in touch with your ship tonight.
- Be ready to leave at ten o'clock.
- Tonight?
- Of course. Good work.
- What is all this?
- Fraulein Thiel leaves with me.
- This is the Reverend Hector Mathews.
- Is it? I mean, how'd you do?
I'm sorry I can't shake hands. My name's
John Harris. I'm looking for the school.
- To what purpose, may I ask?
- See my fiancee, Ms. Burnett.
Ms Burnett didn't tell me she had any connection with an English character.
No; but she soon will have.
If you are going to stay on the island you may have a room at my house.
- Far cheaper than lodging at the post office.
- Would it? I mean, that's very kind.
- May bring your fiancee to dinner tonight.
- Well...
If you give me your meat coupons, we will make a roast.
- They're in my inside pocket and I rather...
- Allow me.
At 7:30 sharp.
- You wanted her to remain... 
-  Who cares what I want? Don't you see...
- I only see one thing: my orders.
- Where are they?
- Here.
- What do you mean here?
What were the actual orders?
On completion of the mission you'll be taken on board.
- On completion?
- Yes, on completion.
And, is it completed?
Until your submarines come up with our squadrons the job hasn't even began.
- I think he's right.
- No other way of looking at it.
I shall leave with a message. And tell Schuster to depart tomorrow night for both of us.
Now you're talking sense.
- Who's that?
- Turn off the light.
I'm awfully sorry. There must be another room.
Come on in.
Thank you. Not expect to see officers staying here.
- It is difficult to find accomodation.
- Right.
- We were just gonna have tea.
- Join us.
Oh no really; I came to find my fiancee, Miss Burnett.
- Is she here?
- Milk and sugar?
- Very kind.
- Let me take it.
More than kind of you. It's rather heavy.
- How'd you do?
- Sit down.
Thank you.
Wasn't strange of me not letting her know that I'd arrive?
- Your tea.
- Thank you.
Well, I should give her a shout.
I'm averse to shouting. All of us here.
Well, in that case...
She'll be surprised to find me here, won't she?
- Cake?
- No, thank you.
I brought this gramophone, and heaps of new records.
Have you heard "The Soldier's March"?
It's rather large, but it has a beautiful tune.
I don't recognize that metal ribbon.
- What is it?
- The Iron Cross, second class.
Second class... Then you must be a prisoner of war.
No. You are.
Oh dear!
Oh, they haven't arrived yet!
During a war, lateness for a meal is not only incivility but criminal waste.
- I'm scare the meat will burn. 
- I bring it nonetheless.
I will not wait longer.
I'm greatly disappointed on Rev. Harris.
For what we are to receive may the
Lord make us truly thankful. Amen.
- Don't bite these, are macaroni.
- I should have some expla...
- Better wait here for them to come.
- Why?
- 'Stay here!
- Hurry.
- Who is it?
- Rev. Matthews and his wife.
Excuse me.
- Good evening my dear.
- You chose a high night to play calls.
Obligations to society take precedence over nature.
- That's rather a compliment.
- A compliment was not my intention. We waited an hour.
- Outside?
- At table.
- At table?
- Precisely.
- He's upset about the meat.
- Our concern has nothing to do with material.
If you and Rev. could not come, courtesy demands a message.
- Then were you expecting us?
- You must have received our invitation.
- I'm afraid not. I had no idea.
- I find hard to believe he failed to convey it.
- I'm afraid he did.
- That's odd.
If I were your fiance, to see you after so long,
- ... I would forget everything else.
- Perhaps you would explain...
- The minute he arrived, he had a nasty attack.
- Attack?
Yes, sort of a suffocation. He wasn't able to say anything.
Oh, he is ill? I'm greatly relieved.
I put a room at his disposal. I couldn't understand his not coming.
He's gone to bed an hour ago.
- It is the most sensible.
- An embarrassing situation.
Ms. Matthews should stay tonight.
- Shall I?
- There's no need for that.
As a Minister, I say that your position ...
- As a future wife? 
- People might talk.
In wartime? Do not worry about me.
My conscience calls me talk to Rvd. Harris.
I will not disturb him to satisfy anybody's conscience.
Good night.
Then...  You choose to defy me?
Not at all. But this is my house I please myself.
We'll see what the Education Committee thinks of it.
- Good night. 
- Good night.
I understand, but he'll be fighting his conscience all night.
- Good night. 
- Good night.
Sandwick Bay? What a hole!
- Should take 2 hs to rendez vous.
- I hope so.
We are 15 submarines. Our orders are not to waste a single torpedo.
- Good.
- We could sink a few.
Tomorrow at same time come and pick us up.
Yes, sir. Bad luck missing a fight like this
- for a woman.
- Mind your own business.
- Good luck!
- Thank you, sir.
- Schuster!
- Sir?
I nearly forgot.
- What is it?
- Butter.
- Sorry...
- Come on.
- What happened? Did the message go? 
- On its way.
Never been so cold. Must be out of shape.
Damn fellow left me sitting in the hail.
Is not our costume to entertain enemy officers however useful they may have been.
- How does it feel to make history?
- I'll make some coffee to keep us warm.
Don't you keep him up; it's been a strenous evening, time he went to bed.
Still you have some way to go, suppose you set us an example?
Come on, have a bit of tact: can't you see we want to be together?
It's only two hours to dawn. Somebody may wonder what has become of you.
- I think I'll have another drink.
- Yes, do.
After all you'll have the whole day tomorrow to bid you adieu.
Good night.
- Persuasive fellow, aren't you?
- Sleep well.
That's better.
- You didn't give him much choice.
- Oh, he's quite happy.
He has his whiskey and he is swinging down the lane, convinced you're in love with him.
In a minute I'll be swinging up to bed.
No, no. I want to talk to you. And want that coffee.
It's 4:00. Let's talk tomorrow.
Tomorrow? Can't you see this chance will never come again?
Our job is done.
In one hour the submarines will be meeting and in two they should strike.
And in a week, you and I will be in Kiel,
How we'll celebrate!
Then on to Berlin. I can see us lunching at the Hotel Adlon.
You'll have the Iron Cross in your bag and you'll be the only girl in Berlin... in silk stockings.
Silk stockings I might take to bed.
I have served under many commanders but none I admired more than you.
- What will you do when you're home again?
- You just told me.
- Trip to Berlin, the Adlon Hotel. 
- And after Berlin?
Another job. Another island. Another Ashington.
And another captain Hardt?
Perhaps. Please let me go.
Commander Thiel, don't forget that you won a victory.
A good commander must celebrate with his men.
If I'm in command, I order you to let me go.
David.
Jill.
- These have been the worst 10 minutes I ever spent.
- Me too.
- It's all over now.
- Yes, darling.
Little fool, what you mean coming out here without a coat?
Running risks like that?
- Where is he?
- Upstairs, locked in his room.
You are a marvel.
Sir!
Special Constable Bob Pratt, sir.
- Know who I am?
- You're Commander Blacklock, sir.
When the patrol arrives tell them to stand by. Nobody goes in or out.
- Where is your armlet?
- When I heard German spies are about 
I put it in my pocket, to be close and not recognized.
- Keep your eyes skinned.
- Aye, Aye, sir.
David, you won't have him arrested until I leave the house, will you?
Give us credit for a little imagination.
Besides, he's safe enough in here.
Couldn't you let him go back to his ship and at least give him a fighting chance?
Too risky. He might find someone who knew the real Thiel and Ashington.
- You hear that?
- What is it?
The destroyer's flotilla.
They've been loading extra depth charges all night. The result of our midnight labours.
In a few hours, there won't be any U-boats in Sandwick Bay, just a few spots of grease, drifting out to the North Sea.
- I think I'm rather sick.
- Here.
Give it a pull a bit.
Woman: you're going into history!
I know.
Buzz upstairs and get your things.
I'm taking you straight to the St. Magnus, she sails in an hour.
I haven't got anything of my own.
Everything is Anne Burnett's.
Then, here we go.
- I'll be back in half an hour to get him. Stand by.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Sir; you wouldn't like us to save you the trouble?
No. I have personal reasons for doing this job myself.
You'll look after her?
I'll be on the bridge. So my cabin is for the lady to use.
- Very kind of yours. 
- It's a wee bit little, but it's warm,
- and you can have it all for yourself.
- Thank you.
Well ...
Walter, hear, Walter. I warn you:
Unless I got a day in port to work on the bottom, it won't last one week.
- We'll see about it, James.
- I hope so.
Excuse me.
The Pastor! I left him tied up in school.
- Poor Mr Harris.
- To the rescue! Good bye.
- You will take care, won't you?
- Indeed.
- All present and correct.
- Thanks.
- Two around the back.
- You two,
... keep an eye on the window, but keep out of sight. I don't want any casualties.
Two on the road. The rest, you got the front of the house.
Keep close to the wall. The rest follow me.
- You think he's gonna shoot us?
- Would you?
You'll find a pastor in school. 
Cut him loose and calm him till I come.
He'll be rather annoyed. Stay here.
Captain Hardt, this is Commander
Blacklock, of the Royal Navy.
If you throw your gun out the window and surrender, you'll be treated as a POW.
Otherwise, you'll be shot.
- Nobody at school, sir.
- What?
Untie the poor devil!
Cast off!
- Hold on. A passenger's coming.
- Aye, sir.
Mr. Harris, commander Blacklock asked for you. I'll tell him that you caught the boat.
I asked myself: if all is as it should be,
Why I am prevented from seeing Rev. Harris?
I can tell you: Harris was tied in school because he was a nuisance.
You were lucky not to suffer the same fate.
- Under Blacklock you would have.
- I cannot pretend to understand.
I'll help you. And attempt was made by German spies to kill Anne Burnett and put an agent in her place.
Fortunately, it failed.
They drop her off a cliff, but by a 100 to 1 chance a patrol boat fished her out.
She said enough so we grabbed the spy in Thurso.
Then we had the idea of replacing her with a counter-spy.
In short notice we found a brave volunteer, the girl you know as Anne Burnett.
The Anne Burnett at school is not the teacher,
Nor the Anne Burnett the Germans intended.
- She's not Miss Burnett at all.
- Substantially correct.
- Then who is she?
- That's an official secret.
- What's the matter, Blacklock?
- Hardt, sir, he got away.
- The German?
- Locked Harris, and he wears his clothes.
Excuse me, sir.
Signals? Send a call to all patrols in the island.
He won't get away, sir. He can't do any harm.
All aboard for mainland!
Stop!
All, in single file.
One by one. Look.
Put them aboard there.
Here we are, sir. All present.
- Eight German prisoners.
- Look starved to me.
Are they off a U-boat?
It blew. On one of their own mines.
One of their...?
- You think they'll see the joke?
- Guess not.
Here, by the right!
You're the right man!
I do not understand.
It's like talking to stuffed dummies.
Well, stand easy; you're depressing.
- What do I do with them?
- Split them up. Forr'ard and aft.
Steward!
- Aye, aye, sir. 
- Give them some coffee.
Poor devils.
- Walter!
- Well, James?
I am not superstitious, but I do not like this.
Mind the engines and I'll mind the ship.
No mind my mentioning.
Six weeks I've been trying to fix a new lining to the bottom of this.
I do not like those Germans. Bad luck.
They could go in the St. Ninian with the other prisoners.
They were crowded. They will not give us problems.
4 in the forecastle and 4 in the saloon, a sentry for four. No one can reach them.
Well... Maybe.
Too young.
- Father, they only speak German.
- Shut up or die.
Captain Hardt. Taking command of the ship.
Take care of the crew. Come on!
Your replacement, he's overdue.
No sausages. It's what you eat, right?
- The Germans!
- Stop!
Below there!
Doddie!
Doddie!
Give me the rocket launcher.
- Get off my bridge whoever you are!
- Drop that pistol.
- You're my prisoner.
- Get out of here or I'll shoot!
Do not move.
- Your ship is in my hands.
- And who might you be?
- I'm a German officer.
- On those clothes?
They do for the present. Where is your wireless kept?
- There is none.
- No wireless?
No German went out of the house while I was at duty, Admiral.
I handed over to the patrol; there were nine of them and one of me.
You didn't suspect that passenger on the pier?
Where were your eyes, man?
He jumped aboard when she was casting off.
I did deliver your message, commander.
- Yes, you told us that before.
- That will do, Bob.
- You got to give credit to Hardt ...
- I give to him for causing this infernal cheek!
He can't get away, sir.
Signals: Wire Scrabster and Thurso.
"Arrest German officer masquerading as a passenger. Stop".
To all the patrols.
"Order St. Magnus to heave to and await destroyer." Repeat that back.
Go below! Go!
Attention.
- I need two men. 
- Very well.
Keep an eye on the crew and passengers.
To monitor crew and passengers! Come with me.
Stay calm. Let's take a look.
Out.
- How did you escape?
- That I must thank you for.
Sentiment made you stop being Fraulein Thiel 
- Or Miss Burnett...
- Mrs. Blacklock!
That's one secret you kept well. How considerate.
Now you captured the ship what will you do?
Lay a course for the submarines at Sandwick.
- You can't do that!
- I'm not under your orders!
- But it is full of mines!
- We shall both take our chance.
- This doesn't mean you and me.
- Right: It means the life of hundreds of my comrades!
- But the children and women here aren't people?
- That will be at your door, not mine.
The war broke. You forget, as I did before.
- You are English, I'm German. We are enemies!
- I like that better.
And I. It simplifies everything!
Come on.
- Lay a course, East.
- East, captain.
Now what, sir?
Listen. You're held as prisoners of war.
I do not want any noise and panic.
Whoever disobeys orders will be shot.
With one exception.
- Be quiet!
- Easy.
A19, A24, A7... St. Magnus spotted by 3 patrols. Still on the right course.
There are eight German prisoners on that ship.
- What are you doing, you can go home.
- Thank you.
If they join forces with a desperate man like Hardt...
- Message from A17.
- No sighting. She's overdue.
She set a different course between A7 and A17.
Sandwick Bay.
My wife is on that ship.
- Orderly.
- Yes, sir.
I want to see the commander of the flotilla.
I'm sorry. You'll have to forget personal affairs.
Sir?
We believe St. Magnus was captured by German prisoners who are making a rush for Sandwick.
Cmdr Blacklock will advise you on the course to be taken.
Go out to Switha Sound and cut her off.
- She's to be sunk?
- If they won't surrender...
Skipper!
Skipper!
- Are you there, Walter? 
- Huh?
We can't keep at this speed much longer.
It's murdering my bearings.
Fearful pressure on engines. 
I don't know how the ship'll put up with.
- Where are we going?
- Due east.
Soon we will leave the patrolled area.
- We're in the hands of the providence.
- No we are not; we are in the hands of a man who cares nothing for his life or yours.
It's all my fault, cause I forgot that we were at war, that the war kills any decent human feeling.
- Can you shake it up a bit?
- No, it's flat out now.
The old man is deaf or dumb. 
Or is a U-boat he's after.
Out.
Out!
Funny; there's no sign of the old tub yet.
- Perhaps they altered course again.
- Not likely.
Have a look, Felix. 
Is not the St. Magnus?
It's her all right. What's she doing so off course?
- Looks suspicious.
- What a cinch!
We gotta save all the torpedoes!
Nothing in the orders to stop us sending a couple of shells...
Stand by to surface!
Guns trough, action stations.
Objective: steamship. Steer right.
Remove the British flag.
The U29!
Schuster! Schuster!
Do not shoot! Do not shoot!
It's me, Hardt!
There's someone semaphoring from the bridge!
H - A - R
There's firing down the haven.
Better take a look. Hold the course, Number One.
Wear the lifevests. Get to the lifeboats.
Stay calm.
To the lifeboat!
Keep calm and put on the floats.
Donald, stop what you're doing and come up to the deck. Hurry up.
There she is!
Stand by. Guns out.
- Don't fire!. She's sinking by the stern.
- They're taking to the boats, sir.
Captain, look, destroyer!
Crash dive!
She's being shelled by a U-boat.
We'll have a crack at it, Number One!
Objective: submarine.
Depth charge... ready!
- You may leave.
- Not without you.
That's an order!
It's time to go, miss. Take it to the boat, James.
It's my old ship that sank us.
Come on now Missi, come on. Hurry.
What are you doing here? 
You should get into a boat.
If you don't mind, I'd rather stay.
Suit yourself. It's your business.
Captain, have you got a cigarette?
Never smoke them, but got a pipe if you want it.
- Never smoke a pipe.
- A little late to learn.
She's there. I can see her!
Hey, Halphen... Going to Epernay?
- When?
- In half an hour.
In your truck?... Give me a ride.
- Sure... Josephine?
- Of course!
- You're not the only one.
- Big deal!
Say, Maréchal...
You have to take up a staff officer.
He's picked the wrong time.
- Josephine again?
- Yeah, Josephine.
Where will all that get you?
She'll just have to wait.
Liquor kills!
Liquor drives you crazy!
The squadron leader drinks it!
Captain de Boeldieu.
Staff officer, division...
Do you know this photo, Mr. Maréchal?
Sure. Ricord took it with me.
And where can I find Mr. Ricord?
- On leave.
- Of course.
This gray smudge worries me...
Here, just below the road.
- That's not a road, it's a canal.
- No, a railway.
Such unanimity honors our aerial cameras.
It was a foggy day.
I'd like to resolve this enigma.
I'll request a plane.
I'll go get ready, sir.
Flying suit or fur jacket?
No preference.
Flying suits smell, fur jackets shed.
Get me the fighter squadron.
Take a car to the sugar refinery.
I just shot down a Caudron fiighter.
If they're Officers, invite them for lunch.
Freisler... make us one of your famous fruit punches to celebrate the downing of my twelfth plane.
Three bottles of Moselle... two Rhine... half a bottle of Martel... three bubbly... two seltzer... pineapples...
Two officers. One is wounded.
I took him to the infirmary.
Captain von Rauffenstein,
CO, 21 st Squadron.
Captain de Boeldieu, staff officer.
Lt. Maréchal, pilot.
My apologies.
My officers.
I am honored to have French guests.
Now, gentlemen, let us eat.
Orderly, coats!
Freisler, your punch...
May I serve you?
I knew a Boeldieu in Berlin... a Count de Boeldieu.
My cousin, Edmond de Boeldieu.
He was military attaché.
He's a fighter pilot now.
Aren't you eating?
I can't cut the meat.
- May I?
- Please do.
You speak good French.
I was a mechanic in Lyons.
No kidding!
Me too, I'm a mecha...
To Captain de Crussol,
French Flying Corps, shotdown in flames...
From the Officers ofthe German 21st Squadron.
I'm sorry about this coincidence.
May the earth lie lightly on our valiant enemy.
I have orders to take custody of the captured officers.
PRISONER-OF-WAR CAMP N17
OFFICERS' CAMP
Read these gentlemen the camp regulations.
"Officers will be treated with the consideration due their rank. "
"However, you are reminded that you are subject to German law. "
"You therefore must obey the rules of German discipline. "
"Any German soldier here has the right to give you orders which must be obeyed without protest. "
"You must salute Officers according to German army regulations. "
"If you attempt to escape, sentries have orders to fire on officers found outside camp limits. "
"Incorrect dress is not permitted. "
" Large crowds are forbidden.
You may not insult the German people,
"or write or speak to civilians from outside the camp. "
"It is forbidden to speak to the sentries. "
Gentlemen, we will now proceed with some minor formalities.
Russian nouns are declined just like in Latin.
- Newcomers.
- Let's warn them.
Angel of purity, angel of light!
Hide your valuables...
- What are they singing?
- To hide our valuables.
Don't touch!
Those belong to me.
I've got nothing, old man.
Had I known,
I'd have brought some cash.
This conduct is unbecoming.
Sorry, it's our duty to search you.
This is war.
I perfectly agree, but conduct it courteously.
If not, I'll see your commanding officer.
How are you - kulele?
Lucky you - calyptus!
Here, Müller, have some chocolate.
You've no right to open my ham!
It's in the regulations.
I read them carefully.
It's rotten! You can have it!
He's hard to please.
I'm delighted when my folks send a parcel.
Here we are, in the heart of Germany, cut off from our families by the front, and here's a can of peas, direct from Paris.
Is it all right?
I'm amazed at how honest our jailers are with our parcels.
It's true!
Take our feldwebel, Arthur...
He eats cabbage every day.
It sticks in his craw. He told me so.
He'd much rather lay into your peas.
Don't kid yourselves.
If they did that, our parcels would stop coming.
They're short of food for themselves.
Hurry, our guests will be hungry.
This tastes like an old sock!
What do they feed the French?
Cabbage, but they have their parcels.
- And the Russians?
- Cabbage roots, but no parcels.
And the English?
I was on the stage before the war... in vaudeville.
- Ever see me?
- Theater's too deep for me.
I prefer bicycling.
You follow the Tour de France?
You must've heard of Fabert,
Garrigoud, Petit Breton...
Can we purchase what we like?
Yes, through the canteen.
Fine, I'll buy myself a comfortable armchair... playing cards, a few books,
English cigarettes.
You won't fiind those.
There you go, sir.
I'll come again tomorrow.
Gentlemen, time to eat.
Sir...
So, gentlemen, what shall we begin with?
Chicken, foie gras, or Captain Cook mackerel?
You're well provisioned.
Don't they feed us here?
In theory, they do, but what they give us is inedible.
Fortunately, we have our parcels, especially our friend Rosenthal's.
Oh, please!
A cognac to start with, sir?
I've never eaten so well in my life.
Some fish?
I'm getting used to
Rosenthal's kindness.
Man is such an adaptable creature.
You can see he's a professor...
Profess her... Confess her...
Address her... undress her...
Oops, a slip!
You're quite a joker!
Is that supposed to be witty?
He's hard to please!
Let's drink to peace!
Not bad, this cognac.
Comes from Fouquet's in mouthwash bottles.
Fouquet's?
It's a bar on the Champs-Elysées.
When I went to Paris, I ate at my brother-in-law's. It's cheaper.
- Been to Paris lately?
- Last week.
Lucky man! Places crowded?
Maxim's was packed.
I never go to places like that...
I prefer a nice little bar... with good wine.
- Maxim's... don't know it either.
- It's no great loss.
We know you eat at your brother-in-law's...
He never lets up!
Is he there, "Mr. Monocle"?
No, he's not.
I've just been to the canteen.
It's about his armchair request...
Let him tighten his belt!
I'll tell him.
He's nice, the guy with the parcels.
Well off?
And how!
You know the Rosenthal bank?
His parents.
Am I tickling you?
- And what's he do?
- Runs a big fashion house.
Funny.
With his money, I wouldn't...
What do you do in civilian life?
I'm a engineer for the cadaster.
Sure, the cadaster... just between us... can we trust your pal, the Captain?
He may seem strange, but he's okay.
You can trust him all right.
- It's all right, then.
- Why?
You see, after dark... we're digging a tunnel.
What for?
To escape.
What do you dig with?
A coal shovel, old food cans...
I calculate we should come up in a garden behind those buildings there.
It's open country.
That's slow work.
We've been at it for two months. just a few more weeks...
The war'll be over fiirst.
You're deluding yourself.
Think so?
Best to be prepared.
Where's the tunnel?
You'll see tonight, after roll call.
So you're digging a hole...
Like Monte Cristo. What a laugh!
- Thanks for the wash.
- You can't do it with your arm.
Mind if I ask you something?
Go ahead.
What's a "cadaster"?
- Maréchal.
- Present.
- Boeldieu.
- Captain de Boeldieu.
- Cartier.
- Here... we go again!
Good night, Arthur!
- Whose turn is it?
- Cartier's.
What's that for?
For breathing.
These are to extend the line.
And the bags?
For removing earth.
This is the alarm.
If I start to suffocate,
I yank on the string...
The can falls...
And the boys pull me out by the feet...
The feet...
What are you waiting for?
Watch me play the mole... mol-asses!
Is the tunnel safe?
It's shored up with wood from the theater.
And the earth?
Stuffed under the floorboards.
But there's not an inch of space left.
Now we fiill bags and empty them during exercise.
Hear that?
I'm sure I heard something.
It's nothing.
Listen...
We'll send someone out to check.
You've got an innocent face.
Go take a peek outside.
I'll pretend to go to the latrine.
Say, Arthur, what happened?
The fellow tried to escape.
We caught him in the garden behind those buildings...
We opened fire.
Behind the buildings?
- Is he dead?
- I think so.
And you, what are you doing out?
Going to the latrine.
- What was it?
- Someone tried to escape.
He got as far as the garden behind the buildings.
A sentry shot him.
He's dead.
The alarm!
- No answer.
- Pull him out.
Hurt bad?
Drink some cognac.
From Fouquet's.
Here's mud in your eye.
Don't drop the bottle.
Who goes down tomorrow?
You do, sir... if you don't mind.
My pleasure. I understand crawling is fine exercise.
I remind you it is strictly forbidden to receive non-military clothing.
Good news?
It's from my aunt in Bordeaux.
People are swarming into town.
What do you think?
They'd better watch out, the Germans are claiming a major breakthrough.
There's been no bell-ringing so it can't mean much.
Up for some gardening?
I hate the way
German bulletins exaggerate.
And our papers don't?
Remember the "Russian steamroller"?
Isn't it time we got down to serious business?
Sure, but not all at once.
And that famous General "Winter," so lethal to the nasty Krauts but so tonic to the Allies...
And do you remember "Turpinite"?
A flask the size of... a radish that could blow up a whole battalion.
They even tried it on a flock of sheep.
Too bad they didn't stop at that.
- What're you guys planting?
- Dandelions.
I'm dreaming of dandelion salad.
The war'll be over before your dandelions grow.
This singular exercise will give us workman's hands.
The trunks are here!
- The costumes?
- At the theater.
There should be a trunk with women's clothes.
Coming, sir?
My theatrical skills are questionable.
Besides, I'm engaged.
- Playing patience?
- Exactly. I'm a realist.
Find anything, Arthur?
Nothing.
Well, gentlemen, enjoy yourselves.
Where will we put all this?
I asked for hangers.
Be careful...
These things should be handled with care... with your eyes closed.
Looks like a little girl's dress.
Dresses are short now. just below the knee.
So I hear. I'd love to see that!
Then put it on.
Not him, he never shaves.
- You have an angel face, Maisonneuve.
- Anything to amuse.
We have to take inventory.
The corset, too!
Take it easy.
It's not only the dresses.
They wear their hair short, too.
Short hair!
It's like sleeping with a boy!
When we're not around, women act foolish.
I'm sure my wife hasn't cut her hair.
That's for high-class floozies.
How would you know, with that mug?
- Shoes!
- How small they are!
Stockings.
Stockings of sheerest silk!
Hey, fellas, I'm ready!
Let us dream a bit first.
You'll only stifle our imagination.
Look at that!
Black stockings!
Looks like a real girl!
Funny, huh?
Doesn't it look funny?
Yeah, sure looks funny.
Poor boys.
Enjoy yourselves.
Out there, children play soldier...
In here, soldiers play like children.
I wish I knew what's going on back home.
- No news?
- Nothing.
I don't care what my missus is up to.
I want out
'cause I'm bored stiff... bored!
So you want to escape for the fun ofit.
Right!
For me, it's the spirit of contradiction.
They won't let me fiight, so I'm dying to.
I hate being here when others are biting the dust.
For me it's simple.
A golf course is for golf.
A tennis court for tennis.
A prison camp is for escaping.
And you, Rosenthal, the sportsman...
Him? He was born in Jerusalem.
No, in Vienna. To a Danish mother and a Polish father, naturalized French.
Old Celtic aristocracy!
Yet for all your French roots, none of you owns an acre ofyour country.
In 35 years, the Rosenthals have acquired three chateaux with hunting preserves, farms, orchards, warrens, stud farms, and 3 galleries of bona fiide ancestors.
If that's not worth escaping to fight for!
I'd never considered patriotism from such an unusual angle.
With all those game preserves, your lackeys must really stuff themselves.
I got into the war in a funny way.
I became a soldier because I'm a vegetarian.
That's right.
My brother and I had stomach ailments.
The doctor warned us against eating meat.
I turned vegetarian and got well.
My brother went on eating meat, got sick and was invalided out.
Your citations show vegetarianism didn't interfere with duty.
Or stop my wife from cheating on me.
You have to admit it's stirring.
I loathe fifes.
Still, it gets to you.
It's not the music that gets to you...
It's the marching feet.
Thanks to your dumb talk
I ruined my pants...
FORT DOUAUMONT TAKEN!
What about our show?
Do we still put it on?
You bet we do!
All the more reason.
In fact we should invite the German Officers.
Although I won't join in your artistic endeavors, Maréchal, let me congratulateyou...
That's the spirit!
Have you met Marguerite
She's neither tall nor petite
With eyes that glow, skin like snow
And lips in a cupid's bow
Well, when this divine creation
Heard my ardent declaration
She gave me a rose, tweaked my nose
Saying, "I'll give you joy"
I said, "Thanks all the same
But that's not why I came"
If you want to give me joy
Marguerite, Marguerite
If you want to give me joy
Make me your loverboy
'Neath her window I waited
And then I serenaded::
"My soul's apyre since your eyes set my heart on fire!"
So this sweet and caring dame
To put out my raging flame
Did a bucket spill from her sill
Asking, "Is it burning still?"
I said, "Thanks all the same
But that's not why I came"
If you want to give me joy
Marguerite, let me be your loverboy
All together now!
And now... direct from Paris!
Get it, Arthur?
Stop the show! Stop the show!
Stop, fellas!
We've retaken Douaumont!
It's in the German papers.
A little hole, to escape.
GERMAN TROOPS
RECAPTURE DOUAUMONT
Isn't that awful?
Can't be much left of it!
Get off my back!
I can't take it any more! I'm fed up!
I want to see some light!
It stinks of shit in here!
Hear me? It stinks of shit!
And I want to hear a voice.
I want to hear a French voice.
What was he yelling about?
The war's too long.
If my calculations are right, we should be under the garden wall in four days.
That's a lot of dirt!
Now that we may get away and reach home again,
I'm afraid of what's waiting for me.
There's more than one woman on earth!
Not for me.
That's why she cheats on you.
One thing upsets me: leaving Maréchal behind.
It weighs on me as well.
In fact... it disturbs me.
But that's war. No room for sentiment.
Glad to seeyou, old man.
We are, too.
Wait until you hear why.
You old dog!
Got anything to eat? I'm hungry.
Have a seat.
Rosenthal's getting some grub ready.
What time is it?
11 o'clock.
Time's dragging today.
Sure, but tonight it's aufwiedersehen!
So, we meet in Amsterdam?
I'm keen to see Holland, for the tulips.
What about the cheese?
Don'tyou like Dutch cheese?
Sure, but they say the tulip fiields stretch for miles.
You have the instincts of a shop girl.
Assembly at three o'clock.
All Officers are to change camps.
Get your things ready.
Gentlemen,
I wish you a pleasant journey.
I hope you will see your wives again soon.
We ought to alert them.
About the tunnel.
Sir, there's a tunnel in Barrack 7.
Open the window.
It stinks in here!
Sir, may I point out there are only two pairs of white gloves left.
We can't get any gloves here.
Try to make them last.
Yes, sir... More coffee, sir?
If you call this muck coffee,
I have to accept it.
At least it warms my insides.
The list of new prisoners, sir.
Three new officer POWs reporting, sir!
Delighted to see you again, Boeldieu.
But I'm sorry to see you here.
We feel the same.
Sit down, gentlemen.
No, thank you, sir.
As you wish.
Captain de Boeldieu, four escape attempts:
Through a heating duct, in a garbage bin, via the sewers, in a laundry basket.
One must lower oneself, at times.
I understand.
Lieutenant Maréchal, five attempts at escape:
Disguised as a chimney sweep...
Correction, sir: heating engineer.
Disguised as a German soldier, disguised as a woman.
Amusing, very amusing.
But less so when an NCO tried to pick me up. That I didn't like!
Indeed?
I assure you.
Lieutenant Demolder, three attempts...
Gentlemen, I respect your patriotism and courage.
But the situation is completely different here.
No one escapes from this fortress.
You understand me, don't you?
So as not to be accused of German barbarism,
I have decided to apply
French regulations.
Look them over.
They make good bedtime reading.
And now, gentlemen, if you will follow me...
Oswald! My coat.
My soldiers aren't young, but they enjoy playing soldier.
We have 25 more guns like this one.
I suppose you know the Maxim gun?
Very well, sir.
But I prefer the restaurant.
Touché!
12th century.
Excuse me, sir...
Was this villa built specially for Captain de Boeldieu and myself?
Are we your only boarders?
Your comrades are back there.
13th century.
A 120-foot drop.
So kind of you to show us around the grounds.
It's such a nice castle, sir.
It's so old...
And so cheerful.
Sorry I can't give you a room to yourself.
I'm touched, but I'd never have accepted.
I hope our walk didn't weary you too much.
Not at all, sir, we're fiine.
- 14th century.
- Pure Gothic.
Ifyou don't mind, gentlemen...
Your friend Lt. Rosenthal, from the Hallbach camp, is here.
- Not old Rosenthal!
- He wasn't any luckier.
The commandant has put you all in the same room.
That way you'll eat better.
That's very nice of him.
A mere formality.
- I caught it with a brunette.
- Who can you trust?
A friend of my mother's.
Quite respectable. She did charity work.
In good society it's usually the pox.
Right, Boeldieu?
The pox used to be our privilege.
But we've lost it.
Like so many others.
Everything is popularized.
Cancer and gout aren't working-class diseases, but they will be, believe me.
How about intellectuals?
With us it's tuberculosis.
Here's Mr. Pindar.
And the middle class?
Liver and intestinal ailments...
They eat too much.
We'd each die ofour own class diseases, if war didn't make all germs equal.
Your dictionaries are in myway.
Excuse me, but Pindar has always been so badly translated.
A lamentable oversight.
I'm so sorry.
Not that I care, but who's this guy Pindar?
Go on,joke! But Pindar means more to me than anything...
More than you, the war, my life!
Pindar is the greatest Greek poet.
The greatest Greek poet?
You don't say...
There! My map'sjust about finished.
See... this is where we are...
16 miles above this bend in the Main River.
To reach Switzerland above Lake Constance and avoid the Rhine, we'd have to travel...
- 200 miles.
- No kidding!
That means walking 15 nights on 6 lumps of sugar and 2 biscuits a day.
You and your map, you're as crazy as him and his Pindar. To escape...
There! My picture's finished.
"Justice Pursuing Crime. "
It came out all right.
Look, to reach this Constance place...
Will it hold?
It can hold 10 of you and 5 like me.
They're searching the rooms!
- Under the mattress, quick!
- No, under mine!
That won't do.
It's childish.
May I?
Now there's an idea!
A convenient little gutter.
Here they are!
Gentlemen... inspection.
"Louise wrote to Victor:
I am as weary as a girl after 22 nights oflove. "
22 nights oflove, imagine that!
Continue!
Not that corner!
Give me your word that you've nothing in here against regulations.
You have my word.
But why my word and not theirs?
The word of a...
Rosenthal... and a Maréchal?
It's as good as ours.
Perhaps.
No, not that!
It's very rare.
Poor old Pindar!
They really are stupid.
Everything go all right in here?
- Not bad.
- For us, too.
And how is your cousin,
Edmond de Boeldieu, the military attaché I met in Berlin?
He's doing well. He's very happy.
He lost an arm and married a rich woman.
A truly fine career.
Recognize her?
Sit down.
Let me tell you something...
Believe me, my present functions revolt me as much as they do you.
That's being harsh.
I used to be a combatant.
Now I'm a bureaucrat, a policeman.
But it's the only way
I can still appear to be serving my fatherland.
I have burns all over...
That explains my gloves.
My spine is fractured in two places.
A silver plate.
In my kneecap, too.
I owe these riches to the misfortunes ofwar.
- May I ask you a question?
- Of course.
Why did you make an exception ofme by inviting me here?
Because your name is Boeldieu, career offiicer in the French Army.
And I am Rauffenstein, career offiicer in the German Imperial Army.
But my comrades are Officers, as well.
A Maréchal and a Rosenthal, Officers?
They're fine soldiers.
Charming legacy of the French Revolution.
Neither you nor I can stop the march of time.
Boeldieu...
I don't know who will win this war, but whatever the outcome, it will mean the end of the Rauffensteins and the Boeldieus.
We're no longer needed.
Isn't that a pity?
Perhaps.
I admire the way you tend your geranium.
Don't think I've become a botanist, but it's the only flower in the fortress.
Nothing grows here but ivy and nettles.
I'm glad I'm leaving with you.
With us.
Sure, I like Boeldieu, but...
With him...
I never really feel at ease.
Different backgrounds...
There's a wall between us.
He's a terrifiic guy.
Sure, and he's on the level, but...
Suppose you and I were on the skids.
We'd just be two bums.
If it happened to him, he'd still be " Monsieur de Boeldieu. "
Anyway, you've been terrifiic, too, feeding us with your parcels.
That's all vanity.
I'm really proud to come from a rich family.
Inviting you to my table is myway ofshowing it.
Most people think we're stingy.
Wrong. We're often generous.
Unfortunately, along with that quality,
Jehovah gave us an overdose of pride.
To hell with Jehovah!
All I know is you've been a real pal.
We've received a large crate, a gift from our Czarina.
Please come and share it with us.
From the Czarina? Must be caviar.
- Coming, Boeldieu? They've got vodka.
- Vodka? Lead on.
Now we can pay you back for all your kindness.
The Czarina is always good-hearted.
Quite a lady, your Czarina.
Think of what's in store!
"Principles ofAlgebra"...
"Elementary Ethics"... "Grammar"...
A cook book!
Something to sink your teeth into!
What a farce!
Let's go before something happens.
Goodbye, thanks anyway.
- The Cossacks aren't happy!
- Let's get out of here!
You have no right to burn books!
It's crazy sending us books!
The sentries are busy with the Russians.
It's a long drop here, but it's unguarded.
If only we'd been ready!
What a chance!
- Especially at night!
- We'll try again.
It was kind ofthem to hold a rehearsal for us.
Now we know if one man can divert them for 5 minutes, his comrades can escape.
- Too risky!
- You're exaggerating.
It would amuse me.
When do you want to go?
Why us? You're in it, too.
Why not? Don't you trust us?
- That wouldn't stop me.
- Well then?
A plan like yours can only work with two men.
And I know your preference.
- It's not fair.
- What's fair in war?
We can't accept that.
I'm not asking you...
I'm telling you.
The arts aren't forbidden here.
You like music?
So-so... I like a good waltz.
I love the flute.
Here's the program:
We buy flutes for everyone.
On the given day: concert in all the rooms at 5 p. m.
That's when night falls.
Five minutes later, they confiiscate our flutes.
At 5:15, another concert with anything at hand: saucepans, animal noises, grinding teeth, whatever...
Result: assembly in the courtyard.
Then what?
That's my concern.
You'll have fiive minutes... to clear the walls and reach the woods.
Look, Boeldieu,
I don't know how to put it, but I feel awful about this.
- Come now!
- Yes, awful.
I'd like to say something...
Pour some warm water over my gloves, will you?
Whatever happens,
I want you to know that...
I'm not doing this for you personally.
So we needn't get mawkish.
Go on.
But there are times in life...
Let's avoid them, shall we?
Excuse me...
So you'll be wearing those?
Any objections?
No, but white gloves for this sort of thing, what an idea!
To each his own style.
You can't do anything like other people.
We've been together eighteen months, and you still stand on ceremony.
I'm the same with my mother and my wife.
In that case...
No thanks, English tobacco gives me a sore throat.
No doubt about it: gloves, tobacco...
We've got nothing in common.
Say what you like, but where there are Germans, there is order.
Sure, the old man is a bit mad with his flower pot and all...
A good thing I'm here to keep those scoundrels in check.
I was a teacher back home.
Lieutenant, confiscate those damned flutes at once!
I advise you not to start again!
We'll do just that in 15 minutes.
Order executed, sir.
You see? It worked.
Put them on bread and water for three days. And no parcels.
Ready, boys... Two seconds...
Assembly!
I understand my students now.
What a lark!
While it lasts.
Well...
What?
Goodbye.
Boeldieu!
De Boeldieu!
Listen!
I beg you! Come down!
Lieutenants Maréchal and Rosenthal have escaped.
So that's why.
Search lights!
Send out patrols with dogs!
Alert all military and civil authorities!
Report back to me every quarter hour!
Your orders have been carried out, sir.
No sign of the fugitives yet.
Forgive me.
I would have done the same.
French or German, duty is duty.
Are you in pain?
I didn't think a bullet in the stomach hurt so much.
I aimed at your legs.
It was 500 feet, with poor visibility...
Besides, I was running.
Please, no excuses.
I was clumsy.
I'm not the one to be pitied.
For me it will all be over... soon.
But you'll have to carry on.
Carry on a futile existence.
For a commoner, dying in a war is a tragedy.
But for you and me, it's a good way out.
I missed my chance.
You shouldn't be talking so much.
Sir...
We should've avoided the road.
We couldn't sleep in the reeds.
He's gone.
Didn't you see it was a woman?
- Let's get going.
- Wait till dark.
I'm freezing, I have to move.
Want your sugar?
There's not much left.
And we've a long way to go.
- What about you?
- I ate mine, I was hungry.
You keep it, so I won't be tempted.
You poor thing...
You ate your buttons, too?
Does it show?
So we're not waiting till dark?
No, we'll skirt the village fiirst.
Your foot hurt?
It's nothing... a nerve.
Let's go.
You coming?
You coming or what?
I'm doing the best I can.
You and your foot!
It's not my fault! I slipped.
You slipped! That's all I hear.
If you get us caught, you'll explain you slipped?
We're out offood.
Might as well give up now.
- Gladly. I've had enough too.
- Had enough ofme?
Damn right! If you only knew how you make me sick!
Well, the feeling's mutual.
You're a dead weight, a ball and chain.
I never could stomach Jews!
A bit late to realize that!
Clear out, you're dying too.
You said it!
Get lost! I'm sick ofyour ugly mug!
I'm going! You're on your own now!
So long!
So long! Go ahead!
I'm so happy I could sing...
There once was a little steamboat
Which had ne-ne-nevergone to sea
After five or six weeks at sea
The supplies we real-al-almost gone for good...
Why'd you come back?
Come on.
Let's go, fella.
- Had enough?
- It's okay.
- Want to rest in that shed there?
- Too risky.
- I can't see any smoke.
- Even so...
When the ship's on fiire, you go overboard.
Right. Overboard we go!
Let's go, old man.
- Someone's there.
- The window! Run for it.
I'll draw them off.
Don't move! Keep quiet.
Stay where you are!
French...
We're not thieves.
Prisoners of war?
You speak German?
I sprained my foot. We're exhausted.
We're not thieves.
I'm not afraid.
Go on, call the police.
I won't walk another step!
You sprained your foot?
She says to come into the house.
No, I don't trust her.
She says she's alone here.
She says her child's asleep, so don't make any noise.
Come and sit down here.
I'll be right back.
Hungry? Yes.
- She asked if you're hungry.
- Yeah, I understood.
What about you?
I just want to sleep.
Excuse me, but how far is Wölfiisheim?
Eight miles.
I'd sooner stay here than slog up there!
But duty's duty.
Thanks and good night.
Hush! My child's asleep!
My husband.
Killed at Verdun.
My brothers...
Killed at Liège...
Charleroi... Tannenberg.
Our biggest victories.
The table's too big now.
Relax, it's only me!
You don't mind ifa Frenchman feeds you.
You smell like my grandfather's cows.
A good smell.
You're a cow from Würtemberg and I'm a working man from Paris, but we can still be pals!
You're a poor cow,
I'm a poor soldier.
We each do our best.
You're a bright little girl.
Mommy and I know everything.
Really?
Then how much milk does the cow give each month?
Mommy knows that.
I know I have ten fiingers.
She asked for water.
I know.
For 18 months, I never understood the guards. But her I understand.
- Nice, but it looks cheap.
- I did my best.
I was talking to Santa Claus.
Joseph's got a nice beard!
Here's the Virgin Mary.
Isn't my little donkey cute?
And my ox?
And the infant Jesus...
An ancestor of mine.
"Touché!" as poor Boeldieu would say.
- Think he's dead?
- Let's not talk about it.
We're ready. Go get the kid.
Hold on...
The gramophone and the candles.
Lights out!
Lotte! Baby Jesus has come.
I knew he would!
Is it for me?
I want little Jesus.
To take to bed?
No, to eat.
He's not for eating.
She wants to eat Baby Jesus!
Strictly forbidden, my sweet!
Then I'll eat Joseph.
All right, but in bed.
She wants Joseph? There you go.
You're a good little girl.
Your gramophone's on the blink.
How do you say:
" Lotte has blue eyes"?
Go to sleep, pumpkin.
I don't know how to thank you.
Thank us?
We owe you so much.
Well... good night.
I'll make some coffee.
The coffee's ready.
Say it in French.
Have you told her we're leaving?
Not yet.
It's high time.
You tell her.
- We must be going.
- I knew it.
Maréchal couldn't bear to tell you.
Why?
I always knew he'd have to go.
Come on in.
There's hot coffee.
You should eat something before you go.
Do we wait until dark?
Sure.
Let's say good-bye to the cow.
I've been alone too long.
I've waited so long.
If you knew how happy I've been to hear your footsteps around the house.
Elsa... Listen.
When war over... if me not dead...
Understand?
I... come back here... no?
And you... after... come... with me... to France.
With Lotte... no?
For the journey.
Go quickly. It's better that way.
- Not looking back?
- If I do, I might never leave.
- Let's move.
- We're not waiting till dark?
We'd lose ourway.
The woods will hide us. But in the valley, we'll have to stay low.
You're sure that's Switzerland?
- Positive.
- It all looks the same.
You can't see borders.
They're man-made.
Nature couldn't care less.
I want to see an end to all this.
Then I'd go back for Elsa.
- You love her?
- I think so.
Even if we do make it, you'll go back to flying and me to gunning, we'll keep fighting.
Like the fellas.
We've got to end this damn war... and make it the last.
Don't delude yourself.
Let's come down to earth.
What if we run into a patrol?
We split up, and try our luck. just in case, let's say goodbye and see you soon.
- So long, you dirty Jew.
- So long, you old dog.
Don't shoot!
They're in Switzerland.
Good for them!
Marvelous .. terrific. Bottoms-up boys.
Did you call that a landing?
─ Well, we're down aren't we.
Yeah, we're upside down.
Well, I must have hit a bump.
─ No, you didn't.
You just made another lousy landing. That's all.
How do I get out of this?
Well, you ought to know.
It's your sixth crack-up.
What's that to you?
─ Nothing at all. Nothing at all.
Except that as a pilot, you're an A.1. gunner.
Oh yeah .. I can fly alright.
─ Sure, sure. You make nice landings too.
Well, nobody can fly these cockeyed training hacks.
It's a cinch you can't.
What's so funny?
─ You are. Look at yourself.
Lay off!
Alright, alright, alright. You don't need to get up on your ear about it.
I'm just trying to teach you how to ..
You'd better see how you can duck those bullets before telling me what to do.
Hiya Mike. What are you two guys doing? Looking for wrangle-worms?
Yeah.
─ Well, you're out of season.
Lovely fellow. What was the argument about?
This. He thinks it's pretty good landing.
What's the matter with it? You were able to walk out of it, ain't you ..
Yeah, we can walk.
The Colonel wants you immediately, sir.
─ The Colonel, eh?
My compliments to the Colonel, and tell him to keep his shirt on.
It would be a lovely war, you know
Mike, if it weren't for Colonels.
Yeah, and the Army.
Hold everything! Hold everything! I've got some terrible news for you gentlemen.
We're going to France.
─ No!
Nobody told me, I was peeking through the Colonel's keyhole.
Listen, the Colonel's giving Jerry all the dope. He's on his way down here.
Boys, this time tomorrow we'll be up there taking a crack at them.
Yeah, and vice-versa.
I say Gerry, when are we going?
─ Where are we going? Who's going?
What's this all about anyhow?
─ Who told you?
A little bird.
Mike?
─ Cheep cheep ..
[ whistling ]
Well, here's the dope. We leave at seven in the morning.
What's the Colonel think I got? Insomnia?
That's no time to crawl out of a warm bed. Make it noon.
The Colonel asked me to give you the list.
Thomas?
─ Yes.
Travis?
─ Yes sir.
Galloway?
─ Half way to France.
Wilson?
─ Here.
Baxter?
─ Rather.
Smith?
─ Smythe if you don't mind. But I'm here.
Harolds?
─ Present.
Richards?
─ Who, me?
Boy I won't have to go to the dentist tomorrow.
That's the list gentlemen .. Let's go.
I tell you what we do. Go to Princes for dinner, and go on to Murrays afterwards.
Hey.
Haven't you forgotten something?
I don't get you.
Well, my name is not on that list.
What did you have to do with it?
Well uh .. the Colonel asked me if I thought you could fly ..
Sure, I know, and you told him I couldn't.
Now listen ..
You're the best gunner in the bunch.
But you're going to kill yourself if you keep on trying to fly.
Well, It's my life ain't it?
You couldn't mind your own business. You had to queer the one thing I wanted to do.
You got me grounded.
─ No. You're going to be an Observer.
An Observer, huh?
That will be fun.
I'm going to stay here in England and ..
You're going to France.
Well, take this with you ..
Hogan!
─ Hello.
Here's your replacements.
Where?
─ Up there.
Strewth!
Here we are.
Oui, oui. It's my day in France.
Oh .. boy!
Oh boy, I wonder how far we are from Paris.
Did you see those shells bursting up there?
Listen. It reminds me of the
4th of July at Patooka.
I hope they send us over today.
Yeah, well if they do, I want to get back in time for supper.
Is this the uh ..?
─ Let me handle it.
Comment ca va? Nous sommes deux aviators.
From Le squadrone over the .. Angleterre.
Voulez-vous annoncez deux?
A la Commandante. Tres vite ..
You didn't know I spoke French, did you?
─ No, do you?
Are you two gentlemen the new replacements?
Yeah, I guess we are.
─ I'll have your kit sent over right away.
Hogan!
─ Sir?
Take these gentlemen to their quarters.
─ I thought this was planned ..
Mr Kingsford? This is Mr Young.
Your new pilot, sir.
Glad to see you.
─ I'm glad to be here.
Well, dump your stuff and make yourself at home.
Just arrived?
─ Yes, just.
Do you mind if I wash up a bit?
─ Why, go ahead.
I'll get some hot water sir.
─ Here's a clean towel.
Thank you.
Have a good trip over?
─ Yes, fine thanks.
I say, you're American, aren't you?
─ Yeah. How did you guess?
"Young", sir?
Right here.
Major Dunham would like to see you at once, sir.
You take off in 10 minutes Mr Kingsford.
─ Thanks.
Ten minutes, eh?
Hey, better take your flying gear, we're going to do a show.
Are we? Right away?
─ Yes.
Don't waste any time, do they.
Hey Mike.
─ What?
Did they send for you too?
You don't think I'm calling the Major for fun do you?
Come on, let's be in there.
Major Dunham?
─ Yes, that's right.
We're Young and Richards, sir.
Oh yes. Oh, the two Americans.
How are you? Glad to have you with us.
How was your trip across? Tiresome?
─ Not at all.
In fact, I could go back again right away.
How's everything in London?
Last we saw of Piccadilly Circus, things seemed to be going round and round.
And around.
Well, things go round and round out here too sometimes.
You've only got one job here, and that's to take photographs.
And to bring them back. That means flying close to the ground.
Where the enemy can shoot at you with everything he's got.
Everything?
─ Everything.
Come in Kingsford.
The ship is ready, sir.
There's a new .. a new enemy battery.
Reported G.4. .. H.3.
Now GHQ wants photographs at once.
Kingsford here is an old hand. You do the flying, and he'll do the rest.
We'll get them for you, sir.
─ That's the stuff.
Off you go. Good luck to you.
Well, good day sir.
─ Oh one moment ..
I'll give you your instructions in a few minutes.
I can hardly wait.
It's swell. I didn't have any idea
I'd get to go up so soon.
All of a sudden.
─ Yeah.
Well, that lets me out.
Look Mike, you want to go up in my place?
─ Oh no thanks, I'm tired.
Seven months of training for this first minute of action.
Yeah, seven months? I did seven years.
Nervous?
─ Oh, you know, just a little.
If his heart wasn't in his mouth, you'd hear his teeth chatter.
This is an easy one. Jump over the line and keep your eyes open.
And if you see anything you think I haven't seen, hit me .. I'll do the same.
Oh we'll be alright.
I know I'll be alright, because I'm staying here.
If you come back,
I'll be waiting for you.
Major Dunham's orders, sir.
You take off immediately.
Who, me?
─ Yes, sir.
What? .. Sir?
Hey Mike! I got one, I got two!
Tell me about it. You got two?
Oh that's terrific. How did you do it? Tell me ..
Did, did you get back alright?
─ Well, look at me. Here I am.
Two arms, two legs, two of everything.
─ See anything?
The last time I opened my eyes, one of them big black things up there went "boom".
Oh you got two. Listen if you get two a day you get ..
Okay, okay. Oh boy what a kill.
First time over the lines too. Why didn't someone tell me about this line of work ..
Now then, lower him ..
Alright men. Come on, stand back.
─ He's got it proper, he has.
Did you get your photographs, Young?
He's dead.
Yes, I know .. but did you get your photographs?
Oh ..
Yeah ..
Was it my fault, sir?
─ Nobody's fault.
But he's dead.
I'm afraid you'll have to get used to that.
You don't waste any time, do you.
No sir .. that's the third officer I've lost today.
Too bad about Mr Kingsford sir.
He was a nice chap Mr Kingsford.
That's his wife and child, sir.
Alan is dead.
─ Yes, I know.
That's the fifth observer
I've lost in two months.
Yes, but this is war, and death is what we've got to expect.
Yes, I know sir. But five?
─ Stop thinking about it.
I can't.
You volunteered for this war. Now what was in your mind when you came into it?
Well, I wanted to fly. I thought there would be some sport in it.
I thought I'd be fighting alone ..
I didn't expect to be a chauffeur for a graveyard ..
Driving men to their death day-after-day.
Yet that's just exactly what it is.
Day after day ..
Yes .. and maybe tomorrow you won't come back.
Have you thought about that?
─ Oh that doesn't matter.
Oh that's where you're wrong. It does.
What do you suppose they gave you that Cross for?
Oh some absurd idea about bravery.
─ Nothing of the sort.
Oh, of course that was part of it.
But whether you like it or not ..
You're becoming a shining example to these youngsters who are coming out to us.
You don't know it .. but we're telling them: be like Young.
Get yourselves a Cross. Cover yourselves with decorations.
Oh, I see.
Sort of a "shining-example" then?
─ That's it.
Gee, it's a swell job for a guy.
Yes, but it's your job and you've got to finish it.
Yeah .. I know.
That's alright.
Too bad about Mr Alan, sir.
He was a nice young chap Mr Alan.
Oh well .. they come and they go.
Let me see now. There was Mr Alan ..
Mr Caruthers .. Mr Howard .. Mr Warner.
Mr .. ?
You know sir, that nice gentleman with the wife and child sir.
Kingsford.
Kingsford. That's right sir, yes.
Good night sir.
Are you my new Observer?
Yeah.
Well, well .. I gather you lost five men in two months.
Whose fault was that? Yours or theirs?
I wish I knew.
─ Yeah, that would be nice.
Funny you being assigned to me, Crocker.
─ No it isn't.
I asked for it.
I thought you didn't like me.
─ I don't.
Then, what the ..?
─ Curiosity fellah .. curiosity.
I heard about you and your medal.
I wanted to see how you did it.
And how long you could keep on doing it.
How can you tell?
I'm likely to get mine any minute.
─ I didn't mean that.
I was just wondering how long you'd go on before your nerves would go to pieces.
Hmm.
You think I'm yellow, eh?
─ Sure .. I know you are.
Remember that day when I laid one on your jaw and you went down and stayed there?
Remember that?
─ Yeah .. yeah, I remember.
Suppose it was me you'd socked on the jaw, what do you think I'd have done?
I don't know.
Well, what would you do?
Now wait a minute!
You just got out here and you don't know what it's all about yet.
But as long as you're here, you and I have a job to do .. together unfortunately.
You just stick in the back end of the bus, and I'll stick in the front.
And I'll take you anywhere you want to go.
Just see that you don't miss anything.
Want a drink?
Well, well, it's him in short pants.
If it ain't old stick-in-the-mud.
Why, you're still the funny-fellah, huh?
None of that backseat driving there, sunshine.
Oh lay off.
Hiya Slug.
─ What do you say Jerry?
They tell me to keep flying this guy right, so they give you another ribbon.
Don't you worry about it. You worry about your own decorations.
The way I'm missing those enemy planes, they ought to be giving me the Iron Cross.
Hey, you sap.
─ Not me.
Whenever there's dangerous work to be done, who is the Major paging?
Me? .. Never ..
He asks for Lieutenant Jerry Young, that guy with the ribbons on his chest.
Can I help it?
─ Not now, you can't. You are marked.
You see any ribbons on my chest though?
No, you never will.
There'll never be an officer look at me and say "there's a brave man".
"Let's get him to do the dirty work."
What did you join this army for, you sap?
What are you trying to do? Kill me?
And who's flying this ship, anyway?
You made me miss. I had him cold.
─ That's what I tried to do.
Yeah, well not next time you ..
A little higher .. a little higher.
Now .. what was that you were saying up there?
What's the matter? Did your guns jam?
─ Yeah, they jammed.
And next time you pull one like that, I'll jam them down the back of your skull.
Next time you take a pop at a fellah in a parachute, you won't get a chance to.
What do you want me to do, kiss him?
You alright Jerry?
─ Yeah, by the skin of my teeth.
I nearly caught in on that last dive.
Sweet Christopher, can that Green-Tail fly!
You should have seen him ride me down in a spin. I tried everything.
He was on my tail all the way.
─ Yeah, well how about the ..?
Oh, he's a great gunner. He shot down a defenceless observer at 600 yards.
".. over us, one little game for all of us .. one little .. "
Oh .. I'm poison, huh?
Well, not that it makes any difference, but what is it?
Well it's simply this old boy.
We don't shoot down observers when they get in your way in parachutes.
I don't get it.
That fellah was in an observation balloon.
Maybe he observed something that would help the enemy wipe out this whole sector.
I kept him from landing with that information.
And for that, I'm a dirty-deuce?
Well, maybe you can tell me why?
It's shooting a man in the back.
Nobody does it. That's all.
Sort of a gentleman's agreement old chap.
Say mister, why don't you get wise ..?
─ Why don't you get wise? This is a war!
I'm hired to kill the enemy .. and there ain't no book of rules about that.
Every one I've put away means one less to kill me.
That's my job, and I'm doing it.
─ You're doing it darn well, but get this!
You're not popping off guys in parachutes from any ship I'm flying.
Well that settles that, as my grandma said. Who's going to buy the next drink?
What's your pleasure, gentlemen?
" .. bombed last night .. bombed the night before .."
" .. we're going to get bombed tonight, as we've never been bombed before .."
Come in.
Hello Crocker.
─ Hello sir.
Where's Young?
─ Oh ..
I don't know .. he and Richards are around somewhere I guess.
I suppose I'll have to turn out the guard to find him.
Anything wrong?
─ What? No, no.
Only GHQ has just telephoned.
A French General will be here in an hour to decorate him with the Crois De Guerre.
Oh, another medal, huh?
Well, I suppose he deserves it.
You're getting one too, Crocker.
I'll go and get him .. I think he's over at Madame's.
Oh no, never mind. I'll send an orderly.
I uh ..
I suppose he's getting blotto again?
Well, what if he is?
─ Oh, he's drinking too much lately.
Look, Major.
Maybe it wouldn't be a bad idea if other fellahs tried the same brand of whiskey.
Well, I just wanted to know how you felt about him.
Well, don't get me wrong about him, Major.
I don't like that sort of talk.
─ No?
Then, why are going out in this rain to find him?
Well, I'm darned if I know.
Oh come on Jerry, snap out of it will you.
I wish I could get it out of my mind you know.
When you see a guy like that, falling and burning, you know he hasn't got a chance.
You can't snap a picture like that out of your mind.
You don't drink enough.
─ I can't drink enough.
Hey Fanny.
─ Richards?
Comment l'omelette?
That meaning in English
"how's the omelette?"
Coming up, handsome.
You get that? I've been teaching her English.
English?
─ Night school.
He don't believe me Fanny. Put that omelette down there and show him.
Yes, so ..
Voila! .. See?
Mike give you that?
─ Uhuh. It has learnt me good.
The "Big Stiff".
That's what I told you to call the Major, not me.
Okay baby!
Why? .. You no eat? Not you?
You old "son-of-a-gun".
─ What?
He told me your father was of much importance. He was a "big-gun".
So, you are "son-of-a-gun".
Hiya. Hello, you son-of-a ..
Not while I'm here. Shush .. good morning.
What was that?
Oh Mike, just been kidding along with Madame.
Hey, I've been looking for you. The Major wants you.
Me? What for? What does he want?
He's going to hang another medal on you.
Tell him I've got a medal.
─ Well, I see he's going to have two.
Come on.
Bon soir mes amis.
─ Bon soir Madame.
Wait a bit, I'm going too.
Well Fanny, you don't know how much we enjoyed that meal. The omelette was terrific.
Sorry I can't stay and finish it.
Here you are honey.
Oh!
Kiss me Fanny.
Go on Fanny, give it to him.
He's getting it.
Oh, just too rich for the blood.
Well, goodbye Fanny.
How many times must I tell you: my name is "Fifi"
Well .. yeah.
Why you might be "Fifi" to the rest of the world, but you're "Fanny" to me.
Goodbye honey.
─ Haha, good day.
Hey, what's the big idea?
Cool your head off. You can't fall on your face when you're getting a medal.
Listen, I'm alright.
Attention!
[ french ]
Jerry Young.
Royal Flying Corps.
He's going to get your telephone number again. Here he comes, look.
[ french ]
What did he say?
He says you're drinking lousy cognac.
He's going to send you some real stuff.
[ french ]
Michael Richards.
Royal Flying Corps.
Now he's going to get your telephone number, Mike.
Gesundheit!
Au revoir, messieurs.
Well, rather pretty old boy, eh what?
I got this ribbon for being the best dog in the show.
I say, is it really yours?
Well, I had to kiss the
General's ass to get it.
But, what's that to a hero?
Yes, I guess there's only a few of us left.
Boys, I want to tell you, unaccustomed as I am to public drinking.
I just want to tell you, don't get discouraged, see.
Because as long as they keep giving these medals out, that'll keep the war going.
When there's work to be done. Who will the Major page now?
Come on there Hogan, give us that champagne.
It was a great day Hogan,
I want to tell you.
Are you Mr Richards?
One of you gentlemen, tell this boy who I am.
The worst impostor in France.
─ The worst pilot in France.
In the whole world.
─ The teacher's pet.
My pals ..
What's on your mind, son?
─ I'm Johnny Stevens, your new observer.
Observer? Hey Jerry!
Tell us what you do to come out a little. Look, I'm father.
Observer? Step up to the bar, son.
Would you like to have a drink?
─ Sure, thanks.
Hogan .. give my son a bowl of milk, will you.
Could I have a little whiskey?
─ Whiskey? Whiskey?
Give him a little whiskey and a bowl of milk.
You know, look out for this whiskey, it's kinda strong, son. Knock you down.
Weaned in a distillery.
This is our mess gentlemen .. you know, we're not long on formality here.
Now, if you come along, you shall meet some of our men.
We'll give you the drug-store and 800 dollars.
You want them to get on with the war, you want ..
Congratulations Jerry.
─ Oh, thank you sir.
I'm proud of you, looks great.
Hope you get a lot more of them.
Thanks.
There's a new batch of youngsters just come up.
Just babies, huh?
─ Yes, I know.
I want you to say a few words to them.
─ Oh no, no.
Yes, yes. Great for their morale.
Buck them up no end.
A "shining-example" huh?
Yes, that's it .. now come along.
Gentlemen .. gentlemen.
You've probably all heard of Jerry Young.
And I dare say that some of you know the sort of things that he does.
Well, I want you to meet him.
My pleasure.
How do you do, sir.
─ How do you do.
I hope we'll all get to know each other better.
Well, go on .. I've asked him to say a few words to you.
I .. I don't know what to tell you.
Well Jerry, they're all interested in your latest victory.
Wasn't much of a victory .. single combat.
Crocker and I were lucky, that's all.
There are a thousand more chaps like the one we got this afternoon.
We need you.
And I might tell you .. the first time you shoot down a man ..
Don't let it get to you.
Don't .. just try to remember that ..
The cause you're fighting for .. is right and just.
They are your enemies.
You are fighting for humanity.
And for the .. preservation of civilization.
I guess that's all.
─ Thanks.
Is that what you wanted?
─ Yes, that's just exactly what we want.
Get down you fools! Get down!
Alright Major?
─ Hey Mike, those kids ..
Thanks.
Yet .. I didn't even get to the front.
Not a chance to do anything .. did I?
No .. only die ..
Somebody will get a nice, shiny medal for this.
Come on fellahs, can't do any good here .. not now .. come on boys.
There you are .. there you are .. there you are.
There you are, you got it.
Shoot .. shoot!
You got him .. you got him!
He's burning .. got it ..
There .. there you are ..
There you are, you got him .. you got him ..
You got him .. you got him!
Is that him?
Yeah .. he's burning, he's burning ..
There you are .. there you are, there you go.
Don't shoot, shoot, shoot it. Shoot.
I lost five .. I lost five .. I lost five!
I lost five sir. I know sir, but five.
Five in two months sir. Five .. five sir.
Kingsford .. Howard .. Warner.
Caruthers .. Alan.
Kingsford, Howard, Warner.
Caruthers, Alan.
You're fighting a great fight .. fighting for humanity.
For the preservation of civilization.
Kid .. kid .. little boys .. little boy .. look Mike.
Look Mike, they're burning.
Look Mike, they're burning!
Oh blood .. blood .. stinky blood Mike.
Mike, I can't stand it ..
I can't stand it, Mike ..
I can't stand it, I'm going to stop it. I'm going to stop it.
I'm going to stop the whole, rotten mess. Now listen ..
Look out Mike .. look out Mike!
He's right on your tail.
Look out Mike!
Come in.
Anything wrong?
What do you mean?
I heard an awful racket and I thought somebody else was hurt.
No, just me having a bit of a nightmare.
Oh I'm sorry .. I didn't mean to disturb you. I'm ..
Oh that's alright.
Gee ..
Must be great to be able to wear those.
Look at him .. after all he's been through .. and sleeping like that.
Yeah .. wonderful.
Pretty awful, wasn't it ..
Seems a pity .. all those boys.
Well, I guess if they hadn't got it that way, they'd have got it some other way.
Well, what's on your mind?
I want to be assigned to another pilot.
What for?
I'm afraid I ..
─ But you're not afraid of anything.
Oh, I'm afraid to ride with him anymore.
He's cracking.
Oh .. so that's it, is it?
Well, if you think I'm going to break up the only team I can rely on ..
You are badly mistaken.
I'll give him ten days leave .. today.
That ought to put him straight.
─ It might.
And when he comes back, you'll fly with him.
That's all.
─ Thank you sir.
Probably wondered what it's all about.
The one in red hasn't got crosses or circles on its wings.
I hope it ain't a bomber.
You know, here she goes, sir.
Hogan, Hogan, Hogan! .. That's hot!
It was so hot I couldn't hold it, sir.
─ Go away from me. Don't bother me.
I wonder if he's on our side.
Say Mike.
─ What?
Look after yourself, will you.
─ What do you mean?
Oh, I had a dream last night, and you got all mixed up with Green-Tail.
Hmm. I told you, I'm getting a long, white beard.
Morning Major.
─ Morning.
I've got good news for you, Jerry.
─ What's that, sir?
You're going on ten days leave.
I didn't ask for leave, Major.
─ No, I know you didn't.
But I thought it would do you good.
You know .. change of scene and change of talk.
When do I go?
─ Immediately.
In time to catch the afternoon leave-boat.
Boy, London and clean sheets, huh?
─ Yeah, and a private bathtub.
Yes .. and it means double work for you while he's away.
Makes no difference to me. Just so I get my
Thursdays off, and every other Sunday.
Hey Major ..
If Richards is going to fly tough jobs, he ought to have Crocker as his gunner.
Yes, well we'll do that.
─ Good.
Come on, what's the idea? You know
I don't like that guy Crocker.
Don't be a sap, he's the best gunner in the outfit.
If you're together, you'll both be here when I get back. Listen Mike ..
What do you want me to bring you back from London? Anything you say.
Anything?
─ Yeah, anything I can bring back here.
Well my second choice is ..
You know the little place on Jermyn Street that sells that Gorgonzola cheese?
Listen, bring me back a piece that will come to me when I whistle it will you.
Okay.
Hot-damn boy.
─ Come on boy, I gotta pack.
He's got me!
Hey! .. Listen, when you get to that place that sells the ..
Then my dear chap, when the barrage lifted we counter-attacked.
Drove them from the woods.
And in my position, they followed it with machine guns on our left flank.
By Jove, we drove them back.
What do you think of that?
Marvelous.
The most wonderful thing was that he was shot down in flames from 12,000 feet.
And like a torch he was, at night.
Ever see anything like that Jerry?
Yes .. I'm afraid gentlemen, if you'll excuse me, I've got to be going.
Goodnight.
Jerry, it's been wonderful to have you here. I hope you've had a good time.
It's been charming.
I thought it would be a relief after all you've been through.
Yes, thanks.
But before you go, there is one member of the household that you haven't seen.
And he's terribly anxious to meet you .. my youngest.
Tommy .. this is Jerry Young.
How do you do Tommy.
─ I'm fine sir.
Is it true that you shot down 18 planes?
I guess it is.
I'm planning to be a flyer just like you, just as soon as I get time.
Do you think I would make a good flyer?
─ Oh wonderful. You're perfect for it.
It must be fun, isn't it?
─ Well, not exactly Tommy.
Don't you like to kill the enemy?
─ Oh yes, yes. Of course.
Tell me about it. Tell me about all of it ..
Well .. I'm afraid I wouldn't have time for that, son.
What do they look like when they fall, sir?
Are they on fire?
Sometimes, yes.
─ Do they look like a roman-candle?
Yes .. yes, like a roman-candle.
Do they explode with a great, big bang?
Yes .. a great big bang.
Good night sir.
Go up to bed, son.
Can I drop you somewhere?
─ I don't want to be dropped.
I want a cigarette.
And now what?
─ Where are you going?
I hadn't thought, perhaps around the park?
Tell him that then.
Through the park.
─ Right-oh governor.
Pretty bad wasn't it?
Well it was alright until the kid came down.
You can't get away from it, can you.
─ How did you know that?
I've been watching you all evening, but you didn't see me, did you?
I'm sorry .. I'm afraid I didn't.
Do you like this driving round and round?
─ No, not much.
Perhaps you'd like to go somewhere?
─ I think you need a glass of champagne.
Oh, I couldn't stand to go to a nightclub or anything like that.
Let's have it here in the park .. in the moonlight.
Stop the driver and send him for some.
Stop here.
Rush off somewhere and get a bottle of champagne and bring it back here, will you.
Right-oh governor.
You are ill, aren't you?
No, no I'm alright, I'm perfectly fine.
Come over here and sit down.
Why are you doing this?
Don't you like it?
I like it very much.
Well?
Only I uh ..
I don't seem to know what to talk about.
─ Why talk?
Oh, here he is ..
Here you are governor.
─ Thank you.
That's fine.
Just .. wait for us, will you.
─ Right-oh sir.
Moonlight .. quiet .. romance.
Champagne.
─ Uhuh.
Thank you.
Why? .. That's what I want to know.
Why?
─ Tell me about it.
No, there's nothing to tell.
It's the same old thing, over and over again.
Day after day ..
─ Well ..
Well you see .. I thought it was like a game.
Pool .. or something like that.
And on the first time I went up, I brought down a plane. That started it.
That started everything.
A treadmill.
Somebody slapped me on the back and told me I was great, and I had to go on.
More planes ..
More dead men ..
More medals ..
There isn't any end .. then what do you think happened to me?
I was what they called a "shining-example".
Could there be anything more terrible than that?
A "shining-example".
The only way I can go on is to kill somebody.
When I get up in the morning, the first thing I say to myself is ..
Well, you've got to do it again today.
Because if you don't do it ..
You know what I'm talking about.
Yes.
They bring young boys ..
Only kids, just away from their mothers, who don't know anything.
And then they point to me and they say: "be like him. Be like him".
That's what I've got to do.
You don't think I'm afraid, do you?
I know you are not afraid.
Every time I knock some poor devil down, burning, they buy me drinks.
Oh my dear .. oh my dear ..
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have bothered you.
You didn't bother me.
You've been awfully kind.
I want to be kind.
Hello Jerry!
─ Hello boys!
Hi Jerry!
─ Hello Jerry ..
Have a good trip?
─ Yeah, swell.
Look, he's back sober! Welcome back from the battle of Piccadilly!
Where's Mike?
He and Crocker are out on a show.
─ He'll be back pretty soon.
What is it, Scotch?
─ No, I bought it for Mike. Smell it.
Oooo! Hang some black crepe on it.
Is he's going to eat it?
─ Sure he is ..
That looks like Mike now.
─ Yeah, that looks like him.
Hey Mike! Mike ..
Ah, bonjour mon ami.
Mon ami.
Oh you must have mixed with somebody.
La fromage! Pour votre Marie.
There you are my lad.
The most thoroughly disreputable cheese in the entire British Empire.
Oh, what a lovely stink ..
What a dogfight you must have been through.
Hello Crocker.
─ Hello Jerry.
What happened?
─ Green-Tail.
I got Mike to turn back so I could take a crack at him.
I did .. but he took forty-nine at us.
Well, I guess we're lucky to be here.
─ I'll say you are.
Mike .. Mike ..
Hey Mike .. Mike, you can't do that.
I'm alright .. a little gas ..
I guess it must be the cheese.
Mike .. Mike!
─ Mike!
Do something! Get an ambulance. Hurry up.
Major, you're wanted.
Richards is wounded.
Careful, watch his head now ..
Gently .. gently.
Come on Mike .. easy, easy.
He's dead.
Well, you got your crack at Green-Tail, Crocker.
You got Richards to go back and tangle with him, eh?
Couldn't be satisfied to get your pictures and come on home.
You had to fight and kill somebody.
─ Wait a minute Jerry.
Well you did it! You killed somebody ..
You killed the best guy that ever flew in France.
You and I are washed up Crocker.
On the ground and in the air.
Hogan .. transfer Mr Crocker's gear.
Mr Stevens is flying with me.
They bombed 86th Squadron last night.
Killed eleven men, and destroyed the hangars.
I heard about it .. a rotten show.
We want photographs of their aerodrome.
We're going to make a counter-raid.
Where is it?
Well GHQ thinks its uh ..
Thinks it's about .. here ..
Well, get back as soon as you can.
Jerry.
You know that's a tough section .. well patrolled.
You're liable to be attacked.
I wouldn't give you odds.
Wouldn't you rather have Crocker with you, than that youngster?
No thanks. I'll take Stevens.
I see.
Well, happy landing.
Thank you sir.
All set Johnny?
─ Right-oh.
Keep an eye on the sun.
Don't let anybody sneak up under your tail.
Oh lummy, what a crack-up that was, eh.
Have we got him?
The bloke put up a good fight, just the same.
Here he comes ..
─ Here's the bloke what got him!
Well done, Flying Corps.
Jolly fine show I calls it ..
Why that's the stuff to give them.
He never had no hope, he never.
Where's your pal?
He fell out .. he fell all the way ..
His first flight.
You bleeding well finished the other kid.
Did you kill him? .. Great work.
Do you know who it is?
─ No.
It's "Voss" .. the great ace.
─ Voss?
He was a holy terror.
─ He was the greatest flyer they had.
Just a kid.
You'll get a citation for this.
Hello Jerry. See you're back again.
Good show old boy.
They'll give you a commendation for this.
─ Well done Jerry. How'd you do it?
What's the matter with him?
─ The way he's acting over it.
Voss! .. An ace!
You got a combat-report blank?
Too bad about Stevens.
Yeah.
Too bad.
".. and he impressed his last few guests, before he passed away."
"I'll tell you how it happened, on another day .."
What do you want?
─ They're waiting for you in there.
Major Dunham sent me.
Well, I'm not going.
Well, that's alright with me, but they're giving this binge in your honor.
A binge to celebrate the killing of a twenty-year old kid.
Gee .. that's great.
I wouldn't miss it for anything.
Sure I'll go.
Here's Jerry now. Come on Jerry.
Mr Crocker, come here.
We've been waiting for you Jerry.
Come along Jerry .. we've imported some real food.
And the General has sent up a case of '98 Clicquot.
Gentlemen .. I think we ought to start this affair ..
With a toast to Jerry.
Gentlemen .. Jerry Young.
Well done Jerry ..
Everybody up.
I'm drinking to the man I killed.
─ Voss!
Thanks for the binge, boys .. it's an honor.
Too bad Stevens can't be here.
It would have meant a lot to him.
He fell out .. 3,000 feet.
I wouldn't have got Voss if he hadn't come at me head-on.
I went to the field hospital to see him.
I thought I'd find a man.
I found a blond kid .. like a lot of you!
Two bullet-holes in him.
They congratulated me for it.
Congratulated me all day .. told me I'd done a great thing.
They set me up a shiny, tin
God. A hero .. an ace!
They expect me to act like a hero.
So you can all play at being heroes.
So you can go out and shoot other kids down, and get killed yourselves.
They'll decorate you for it.
They'll give you medals.
Just like they did me!
I got these for killing kids!
They are all chunks of torn flesh .. and broken bones .. and blood!
And .. for .. WHAT?
I give you .. WAR!
Drunk as an owl.
─ Ha, I'll say he is.
Blotto.
─ And who has a better right?
Another bottle of wine, Hogan ..
[ Gunshot! ]
[ door knocks ]
Come in.
Hello Crocker.
Hello sir.
I got him to bed alright sir.
─ Oh good.
I see .. he got drunk quickly, didn't he?
Yes sir.
Yes .. well, he'll be alright in the morning.
I hope so sir.
─ He's got an easy show tomorrow.
Yes sir.
He ..
He asked me to fly with him, sir.
─ So?
Oh .. oh, I'm glad of that.
Yes sir.
You are sure there is nothing I can do?
No sir.
Goodnight Crocker.
─ Goodnight sir.
Subs: T-G. 2015.
Right through the lung.
Bell, dismount the men.
Yes, Sergeant.
Dismount!
Pity.
- Decent boy, in some ways.
- Yeah, no soldier though.
- See the blighter what done it?
- No.
Blasted Arabs. Hide like sand flies.
Never see them.
There's them GS shovels.
Will I get two or three of the blokes to start in?
Right.
Sanders!
Corporal.
Brown.
Here.
Hand your horses over to McKay.
Put your rifles back in your buckets and get them GS shovels.
What happened?
There was a shot and then the officer...
Is dead, my lad. Gwendolyn is napoo.
We are gravediggers.
Understand now, young fellow, my lad?
But out here?
Where are we gonna bury him?
Doesn't make much difference, does it?
- All right, men, that'll do.
- Gonna mark it?
What's the good? Bell, mount the men.
Sergeant.
Haven't you forgotten something?
Oh.
Go ahead, Sanders.
"Almighty Father...
"we commend the soul of our brother departed...
"and we commit his body to the ground.
"Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust...
"in sure and certain hope of the resurrection...
- "unto eternal life, through our Lord."
- Amen.
I'm sorry, Sergeant, but that's not the entire service.
Sorry, Sanders, but we gotta be moving.
If we stick around here... we'll be patting you and a couple of others in the face with a spade.
Put your topi on.
All right, men.
Return to your horses.
Morelli, do you see anything?
No. Nothing but sand. Plenty of it.
Corporal Bell.
Yes, Sergeant?
- Do you know where we are?
- No.
Do you know what we're here for?
Do you know where we're going?
- No.
- Well, neither do I.
Huh?
That young lad, that officer back there, never gave me his orders.
What?
I ask him four or five times, and he'd always say...
"I'll do that, Sergeant, tomorrow."
Well, here's our tomorrow.
A nice one, too, ain't it?
Didn't he have them on him?
Wasn't they in his pocket?
No, kept them in his head.
A fat lot of good that'll do us now.
Where are we going now?
What are we gonna do?
Well, we're lost.
You heard me. Lost.
What are you figuring on doing?
Well, I've worked it out the best I can.
We're heading due north.
We ought to hit the river tomorrow night.
Yes, we may hit the river and that'll be that. But what else will we hit?
Yeah. A fine thing, ain't it, huh?
A patrol patrolling and not knowing where they're at... and the orders locked up in that dead kid back there.
Dismount.
That's it, Jock.
That'll do your horse good.
Pearson!
Yes, sir?
- You're a fool, Pearson.
- Yes, sir.
Now, come on.
Take it off, give it to me.
Now, come on, come on.
You know I won't drink it.
You'll have a little left for tonight.
All right, men, walk your horses.
I don't know, Jock,
I will never forget the time...
I drank the 57 bottles of beer on a bet.
It was in a bar in Calcutta, the Queen's Bar.
- Ice cold it was.
- 57 bottles.
Well, I may have miscounted a few, one way or another... but I know it was 10 below me record.
Freezing cold it was. Gave me a chill that nearly caused my death.
A pity it didn't.
All right, then.
Horse down!
Hold it! Halt!
Come on, laddie, please get up.
Too bad.
Sorry, McKay.
Here, Jock, give me that.
Take my horse. Go on with the rest.
Bell... what do you make that out to be?
Looks like something moving.
Not sure. Such a glare.
- Couldn't be the brigade, could it?
- Brigade? No.
Might be Arabs.
Morelli.
Hey, Morelli.
You're the hawk-eye of this party.
What do you make that out to be?
Trees.
Whole clump of them.
Sure it ain't a mirage?
Mirage, my aunt.
Think he's right, Bell?
Maybe and maybe not.
Maybe it is Arabs.
Arabs, my eye.
It's palms, I tell you.
It's an oasis.
That's what it is.
- Right.
- An oasis.
Prepare to mount.
Take it easy.
Take it easy, there.
Look after your horses.
That's enough.
Now come on, watch your horses.
"Oh, Mother, may I go out to swim?
"Yes, my darling daughter
"Hang your clothes on a hickory tree
But don't go near the water"
Corporal Bell, come on, get out of there.
Out, all of thee, and have some lemonade.
You forgotten yourself?
You haven't watered your own horse, have you?
Go on, get your rifle and see what's in there.
You ought to know better.
Now come on, you men, get out of there.
Aye, sir.
You can bust your own guts, but look out for your own horses.
Get your horses in there now.
Oh, Jock, boy, why, this is better than beer.
Aye.
Come on, girl.
Take it easy.
Oh, boy.
A creepy place.
What do you think?
Mohammedan mosque.
- I wonder how old it is?
- It's hard to say.
Funny.
Water, plenty of dates, this thing...
- and not a soul around.
- Yeah.
And not a ghost of an idea where we're at... what we're here for, or where we're going.
I want to see the horses.
Well, the horses look good.
I bet they feel better.
Abelson, smarten up there.
Do up that shoulder strap, and carry that rifle, don't sling it.
You're on duty.
- Is that your horse?
- Yeah.
I thought so.
Look at his back.
I've told you about this before.
You ride the officer's horse tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
Are we gonna ride tomorrow?
I said tomorrow.
We pull out before sun-up.
I say, Sergeant, did I hear you right?
- We moving out of here tomorrow?
- Yes.
Gentlemen, I am the bearer of joyful tidings.
Yeah?
We leave this charming paradise tomorrow.
Paradise?
It is the devil's own backyard.
Don't jest, Quincannon.
You know what this place really is.
I do, and I can tell you in 50 words.
And every one of them forbidden.
If you'd read your Bible... instead of hanging around canteens and native quarters all your life... you'd know that Mesopotamia... this, this very spot that you're standing on this very minute... is the actual Garden of Eden.
The Garden of Eden!
The Garden of Eden, how are you?
I tell you, it'd take no angel with a flaming sword to drive me out.
That's blasphemy, Quincannon!
- You'd better not...
- Blasphemy?
Are you aware you're talking to a man who was for 10 years an altar boy?
- How you feeling, Pearson, better?
- Oh, I feel fine, thank you, sir.
I'm sorry I wasn't quite up to it out there.
- Guess I'm not much of a soldier yet.
- You're all right, lad. You did fine.
- You'll learn.
- Thank you, sir.
Sure he'll learn.
Take for an example yon Matlow.
I remember the time when he first came to the regiment 20 years ago... the time Quincannon and myself had making a soldier of him.
Michael, do you mind the time we were at the depot at Poona together?
- I was Troop Sergeant Major at the time...
- Excuse me... but I was Troop Sergeant Major at the time.
Oh, no, Michael.
You were Troop Sergeant Major... but you had been broken for being drunk and disorderly... setting fire to your tent... and appearing on the parade ground with nothing on... but your drawers and your topi.
That's a dirty lie.
I did not set fire to my tent.
Well, as I was saying...
Matlow was no better nor no worse a soldier than he.
And look at him now.
- Quincannon.
- Sergeant.
Yeah?
How soon are we going to join up with the brigade?
I don't know.
Tomorrow, possibly the next day.
Yes, sir.
Yes, but everything's all right now, isn't it?
Why, yes, certainly.
Quincannon, have you seen that the horses are securely pegged down?
Yes, Sergeant.
Well, I want you to paste this in your hat.
Our getting back to the brigade depends entirely on our horses.
Well, we've lost one today, you know,
McKay's horse.
- Now that's bad.
- Now, don't worry, Sergeant.
They're as secure as if I was in charge myself.
They'll stand through the night.
Well, before you kip down tonight, look them over again.
All right, Sergeant.
Pearson.
I think I'll give you a whack at sentry-go tonight.
Will do you good.
Yes, sir.
All right, get your rifle and watch over the horse lines.
Yes, sir.
Well, boys, it's hotter in here than it is out there.
Aye.
Hey, here's a place there might be some shelter from the wind.
Come on, Matlow.
I say, jolly sort of place, isn't it?
There ain't no swansdown feather beds like what you got at home, Topper.
The Garden of Eden Temperance Hotel.
Brother Sanders, will you lead us in prayer, or are we to be spared that?
I likes that tune, Morelli.
That was my cue in the music halls.
When the orchestra did that... boom.
I come down rolled up in the curtain.
It always knocked them.
Topper, what is it when two things happen at the same time?
- Coincidence?
- A coincidence. That's it.
Play it again, will you, Morelli?
That's what the band was playing when we sailed from Tilbury.
And here was I, standing on the deck... and there was Molly, in a red hat, a-waving from the dock.
First time she ever saw me in my khaki, and the last sight I ever had of her.
So, there's a Molly with a red hat in your love life, is there?
Molly's me wife, Topper.
We were married that morning by the regimental chaplain.
- Married, huh?
- Got a baby.
I'm the father of a boy.
Herbert Hale Jr. II.
Got a letter when we left Cairo.
I've got a picture of the nipper here.
It's in my haversack. I'll show you.
He's two months old.
- Two months?
- Yes.
Splendid fellow, Herbert.
Nothing like a family.
It's all right, Pearson, it's me.
Now, if I was one of those sneaking
Arabs, I'd have cut your throat by now.
Well, I'm sorry, sir. I didn't think.
I mean...
I was just thinking.
What were you thinking?
Well, that moon.
It's so bright.
It sort of gets one, Sergeant.
I was just thinking that in 12 hours' time... that same moon will be shining over England.
Makes it seem sort of close.
Don't you think so, Sergeant?
I never thought of that.
- How old are you, son?
- 19, sir.
Public school?
No, I had a tutor for a while.
Just Mother and I.
She never wanted me to be away.
Guess that's why I'm here now.
I ran away.
Joined up, huh?
Well, I thought it was the right thing to do.
My uncle, well, he's in the War Office.
He wanted to wangle me a commission.
But I'd rather be on my own.
That's why I'm glad I'm here.
Oh, I suppose I'll get a commission, eventually... but it's a fine thing to come up from the ranks.
- Don't you think so, Sergeant?
- Yes.
You see, you're more on your own.
You're around fine soldiers... men like Mr. McKay and Mr. Quincannon... the kind of soldiers I read about in Kipling. I'm crazy about Kipling.
And here I am... a part of it now.
The finest thing is, they're so modest.
They don't even see the glory in it, do they?
No.
How about your mother?
What did she say about your joining up?
She didn't like it.
First time I ever saw her cry.
Well, you're lucky, son.
Nobody ever cried over me.
Well, stop looking at the moon or you'll be seeing ghosts.
And keep your eyes peeled, because we don't know what's out there, you know.
Yes, sir.
- Good night.
- Good night, Pearson.
Fall out!
Knifed in the back.
Aye, that's Arabs, Michael.
We've met it before.
The swine.
Bell, Corporal Bell!
- So help me...
- I'll get him!
Where's the horses?
They're gone!
Fall in!
Extended order.
From Cook, right turn.
Double. Left turn.
Keep 25 yards apart.
Circle the mosque.
Sergeant, I found Bell alive.
Just.
There's where the horses went.
Sergeant, can't we put something over it?
I could get a couple of sticks, Sergeant, and tie them together and...
Wait. Get Pearson's sword.
Put it there.
I think he'd like that.
See anything?
No.
Beats me, how in the name of holy...
Oh, shut up. We've chewed the blinking rag about it... all the blooming morning.
- The horses are gone, ain't they?
- Hey!
Whose fault is it the horses are gone?
Yeah, they should never have put that laddie out there, Michael.
Oh, chuck it. Chuck it!
Hey, what kind of lingo is that?
Meant to be Malayan, or possibly Javanese.
- I forget.
- Been there, Topper?
Cruised around a bit.
- What's it like?
- Ain't like this, I hopes.
Oh, palm trees.
But you don't mind the heat.
Lots of water, flowers, mountains, a breeze from the ocean.
Cruised around on a yacht most of the time.
Tell us, what did you have to drink there, besides water?
Oh, the usual.
Gin and bitters in the morning, scotch and soda in the afternoon... and at night, sparkling champagne served in a bucket of ice.
- Don't, don't.
You're breaking my heart.
- Shut up.
I can't say much for the women though.
But, oh, the girls.
All Malayan females should be poisoned at 21.
Before that, they're...
But a wee bit on the dark side, huh, Brown?
Oh yes, they're dark.
But the longer you're there, the whiter they get.
Or that's the way it seems.
That didn't bother me, Jock.
I'll never forget the first time I saw them.
We sailed into a little harbor, about sundown.
The girls all came swimming out... flowers in their long hair, singing and laughing up at us from the water.
Brown skin?
Seemed like gold to me.
A richer, deeper gold than any metal.
I can see that gold shimmer, even now, on their wet bodies... as they swam like mermaids to the rail and climbed on-board... laughing at us like a lot of shameless imps.
Ah, man, Topper...
'tis the soul of the poet you have.
They knew they were beautiful.
What happened then?
Oh, then the men came out.
Yeah, in their war canoes.
Seems they didn't quite like the way we were getting along with the girls...
- entirely too chummy.
- Did you fight?
Yeah, one fellow heaved a spear at me.
I suspect it was his girl
I had under one arm... while I was trying to heave up the anchor with the other.
Go on, go on.
Don't keep us in suspense.
- What come of it?
- Nothing. We sailed away.
Hey, but the lasses?
What about them?
Oh, later on, when we passed by the coast again... they slipped over the side and swam ashore.
- How about it?
- Oh, shut up.
Ain't you got no imagination?
But all the same, Topper, you didn't ought to leave us high and dry like that.
They want the gory details, you know, color.
What their minds will run to is far more exciting than what actually happened.
Brown!
I want a word with you.
- Go ahead.
- I would rather...
In a way, I would rather have spoken to you in private, but that'd be cowardly.
I will say it in front of these...
I will say it in spite of...
Bub, what's all this for?
It's for your sake, for you.
Oh, Brown, I implore you to listen.
Is your whole life so filled with filthy drunkenness... brawling and lust, that here now... perhaps close to your death... the only thing left for you to do is to live it all over again in your mind?
Oh, pack up. It's too hot to listen.
- But Brown...
- And don't shout so.
Brown, you're a gentleman, you've got breeding.
You must have faith.
Why?
Why?
In heaven's name, man, what do you believe in?
What do I believe in?
Would it really interest you?
Oh, a lot of things.
A good horse... steak and kidney pudding... a fellow named George Brown... the asinine futility of this war... being frightened... being drunk enough to be brave... and brave enough to be drunk.
The feel of the sea when you swim, the taste and strength of wine... the loveliness of women, the splendid, unspeakable joy of killing Arabs... the smell of incense and bacon, the weight of a fist... an old pair of shoes, toothache, triumph...
Stop!
All right.
Oh, you're barmy, soapy.
Shut your trap. Leave us alone.
- Hey, hey...
- Hey, wait a minute.
You leave him alone, Abelson.
He can't help it.
You're more offensive than he is.
- What's that?
- I said, you're offensive.
Abelson! Abelson, take it easy.
Oh, go on. You're nothing but a second-rate, broken-down, heavyweight.
If I have to get to my feet, you're gonna regret it.
- Get to your feet.
- No, no!
- Brown, no!
- Hey, wait a minute, come here!
Take it easy!
Brown! Abelson!
Put on those topis.
Sanders, come here.
You're supposed to be looking after Corporal Bell.
Get inside.
I wanna talk to you, men.
Sorry, Sergeant, about that scrap.
Must have been the heat.
- Sorry, Abelson.
- All right.
Well, what do you think of our chances here?
Well, I think the position is extremely dubious.
- Now, what do you think?
- Well, I'll tell you what I know.
Nothing.
I don't know where we are.
I don't know where we're going.
I don't even know where the brigade is.
It's my fault. It's me.
I told you I was a Jonah.
Bad luck, that's me.
Bad luck, if you say so.
Of course, our horses are pinched.
That's Arabs.
What's your opinion, McKay?
How many out there?
Well, we examined the tracks of the horses. There's not many.
- That's just what I think.
- How so, Sergeant?
Well, if there'd been more than a few... they'd have rushed us in force and wiped us out.
- Aye.
- That's true.
How about stalking out somewhere on foot, Sergeant?
With our rifles, and fighting it out tonight.
And leave the Corporal here alone?
How would you carry him without horses?
How would you carry enough water for a long march?
We've gotta stick here and take our chances of being relieved.
We've got water, we've got dates.
But first we've gotta see.
You think you can see everything in the desert, but you can't.
Hardly a thing out there.
We've gotta see for miles.
Sergeant, how about me climbing to the top of that palm tree and having a look?
I could see from there to Bloomsbury.
- That's it.
- Go on, Hale. I'll help you.
All right. Let's go.
That's a boy!
Come on, old boy.
Hey.
A little bit of how's-your-father.
Will you all mind?
Right. Coming up.
- See anything?
- Can't see what I'm looking for...
Molly's red hat on the dock.
Are you sure it's the red hat you're looking at?
If she has a friend with her, let me know, will you?
Half a mile. I see something.
It's moving.
Looks like the sun shining on a rifle barrel.
- Where?
- Right over there, behind that dune.
Right over there, in the shadow.
Look out! Clear!
Hale, Hale, Hale.
Right through the head.
See here, men.
There's a strip of paper in here for each one of us, except Sanders.
I'm leaving him out of it.
All right with you?
There's one of them longer than the others... and the man that gets it, picks his mate and slogs out for the river tonight.
It's our only chance.
We've gotta get help.
Anybody object to doing it that way?
No? All right.
Here they go.
Now, keep it as it is. Don't unroll it.
I'll draw the last.
Abelson.
Morelli.
All right, unroll them.
- It's up to you now, Cook.
- Aye.
Relieve Morelli.
Come on, choose your sidekick.
- Who would it be, but myself.
- No, no, Michael. You are too late.
If Matlow goes, I go with him.
- He'll need my knowledge of soldiering.
- What did you say about soldiering?
- Well, in my 25 years of service...
- And what about my 27?
Three of them in the guardroom.
The guardroom?
Boys, did you hear that?
The guardroom.
Listen, Jock, to your teeth, that's a dirty red lie.
Forget it, forget it.
Brown, flip a coin. You decide.
Have you got a shilling?
Oh.
Eenie, meenie, miney, mo, catch a boodoo by his toe... if he hollers, let him go, eenie, meenie, miney, mo.
Now, that settles it.
McKay, you go with Cook.
And you better get your gear together.
Take all the water bottles, except two.
You'll leave tonight when the moon is down.
Aye.
Oh... by the way... they might not...
There's a chance they might not get back in time.
Now what I mean to say is... if any of you fellows want to scribble a few lines...
I've no objection of
McKay taking them along.
Remember, Jock...
- keep to the north all the time.
- Right.
Head to the river and you'll find the brigade.
Here's some letters.
Morelli's, Quincannon's, Sanders'.
Here's mine.
I didn't know that, Sergeant.
You're a man to be envied.
- Thanks.
- Well, Matlow, here we go.
Goodbye to you, Sergeant.
We'll be sending along for you shortly.
We'll be looking for you.
- Say goodbye, Jock, old scout.
- Goodbye.
And have a couple of pints for me when you get there.
So long, Jock.
No sweating on the way.
- Good luck, Jock.
- I'll try, Michael.
- See you.
- Bye.
- How you feeling, Abelson?
- Oh, I'm all right.
Only it's so blooming hot...
I'm sweating worse than when the sun was up.
Want me to take your turn at sentry-go?
I'm not asking any favors.
I'll do my part.
Well, you'll be relieved pretty soon.
Keep your topi on, son.
- What's up?
- Abelson. Look.
Over and beyond Abelson.
See that moving there?
200 yards.
Blank fire and keep firing.
Hey!
He's moving.
Morelli! Come back, you fool.
Come back!
Morelli, you fool. Come back.
Come on, cover him up. Rapid fire.
You mustn't go. Don't go.
Sergeant. Sergeant! Corporal Bell!
Oh, Father.
Father of mercy.
Sergeant!
- What's up?
- Something moving out there.
Right back of that dune.
Turn out!
Horses.
Get ready.
Let them have it.
Wait, they're not Arabs.
They're our horses.
It's McKay and Cook.
Oh, look at their faces.
Oh, Jock. Jock, Matlow.
Quick, lend us a hand.
We gotta get them out of here.
The dirty, filthy swine.
I'll get one of you for this.
By the cross of Croagh Patrick, by the blood of the mother that bore me... you shall suffer.
I'll get you for this. I'll get...
- Quincannon! Come back!
- Come back, you fool!
- Come back, Quincannon!
- Bastards!
Morelli.
Morelli.
Morelli.
Did you see their faces?
McKay and Cook?
Their eyes and mouths... all choked up with...
Shall you ever forget it?
Oh, shut up, will you?
I'm trying to forget it, blast you!
I was dreaming, thinking I was back in Blighty.
And you wake me up.
That's what's going to happen to all of us.
Maybe, I'll be next... maybe you'll be next.
Why don't you prepare yourself?
Why don't you make your peace with God?
Because I don't have to. I'm all right.
I ain't done nothing to be ashamed of.
There's only been one in my life.
Shut up and let me sleep, will you?
Now, he's gone.
First, it was the Lieutenant... then it was Pearson.
Oh, suck it, will you?
What's the use of talking about it?
Then it was Hale...
Abelson...
Bell...
McKay, Cook...
Quincannon.
And now he's gone.
He said goodbye to me.
Then he disappeared.
What are you talking about?
You're not going the way they did.
They weren't prepared.
I'm going to save you, Morelli.
I know my mission now.
I'm going to make you believe.
Listen, Sanders,
I'll blow you to kingdom come.
I will, so help me. I'll splatter your brains against that wall.
- Now stay away and shut up, will you?
- Steady on, steady on.
Easy with that rifle, Morelli.
- What's up?
- He's crazy, Sergeant.
He ought to be tied up.
If you don't keep him away from me
I'll kill him, so help me, I will.
Morelli, get hold of yourself.
Sanders.
Sanders! Go wake up Brown.
Time I was relieved.
He's gone.
Gone?
- Who?
- Brown.
He went out of that door.
He said you'd understand.
What?
He wrote something in my Bible... for you.
Deserted?
Insubordinate swine.
Bilged out.
Left us like a rat, when we needed every man.
Why didn't you tell me?
You're a party to this, you know.
Get your rifle and get out of here.
You take his place.
Yes.
Yes, that's it.
That's it, Sergeant. Yes.
"Sorry, Sergeant...
"but Quincannon was right.
He marked off one for Jock.
"I'll get another for Matlow.
"Taking a long swing to come around behind them.
"Fine moon tonight.
Should be good hunting.
"Yours contritely, George Brown.
"PS:
"Not a good name...
"but the best I could think of when I enlisted."
- Have a smoke?
- How many you got?
Six. How many have you?
Four.
Not enough, ain't it, Sarge?
Have one of mine.
Sarge, did you ever hear tell the tale of Jonahs?
Yeah.
If only something would move out there.
This... waiting.
- About Jonahs. Listening?
- Yeah.
Well, I'm one of them.
Take that turn of mine before the war.
That was as good a dancing team as ever you saw, Sarge.
Morel and Moree, acrobatic dancers.
Morel was me, see. Moree was Jessie.
She was a good kid, Sarge.
And dance, oh...
She was a looker, too.
We wasn't exactly married... but if ever a guy got a wife that was too good for him... that's what happened to me when I hooked up with Jessie.
We sure was happy, too.
Well... knocking down good money, too.
We're growing so big, we're figuring on with topping the act.
So we stick in a slack wire dance for Jessie.
Just for a climax, you know?
It goes great.
The opening night, we knock them for a row.
We go around hugging each other.
Next night, the wire breaks.
They ring down the curtain to find me over her crying like a baby.
And Jessie's a-lying there, white as milk... biting her lips against the pain, trying to put on a smile... and comfort me.
Comfort me, mind you.
She wasn't killed...
'cause I'm a Jonah.
I guess you don't know what I mean, Sarge.
Guess nobody else does.
You're not bothered with no woman.
Never seen you look at one.
You never was married, like, was you, Sarge?
- Yes.
- Yeah?
That's funny.
I never heard you talk about it.
She died.
Kind of made me hate the kid at first.
Oh.
- That way, huh?
- Yeah.
Seemed to me the little beggar was to blame.
I didn't want him. I wanted her.
- Little blighters grow on you, though.
- I suppose so.
I'll never know.
Pretty soon, all I could think of was the kid.
Wanted him to have everything I'd missed.
Found myself working hard for promotion.
More pay. Saving every bob.
Cor, I had it all figured out.
Sent him to a good school.
Oh, he's a fine little fellow, Morelli.
You ought to see him.
That's what I've been fighting for.
What'll happen to him now, without me?
Oh, forget it.
- If only something would move out there.
- Don't worry.
- You ever had ambition?
- Yeah.
Jessie and me always wanted to play the Coliseum.
Well, I've had it bad in my time, but I've never had it like I've got it now.
Swine... hiding out there.
I'll get them.
I tell you, I'll get them, Morelli.
- And then I'll die.
- Easy, Sarge, don't you go that way.
Hey!
He sees us, Sarge!
He sees us!
Sanders, Sanders, look! See it?
Look!
You see that, Sanders?
We're all right now.
We're all right now.
- He's landing, Sarge.
- Morelli, Morelli, we're crazy.
Hello.
We mustn't do it.
If he goes walking across there...
- Hey, get back! Get back!
- I never thought of that, Sarge.
Get away!
- Don't do it! Turn back!
- Get away!
- Don't do it!
- Turn around!
- Go on!
- Don't do it.
- Get away!
- Hey!
I say...
I say, you chaps should...
You did that! You've killed him!
He came in answer to my prayers, for me... and you killed him, you murdered him!
Tie him up, Morelli.
Tie him up before I kill him.
Look at it out there, mocking us.
What good does it do us?
Better if it wasn't there.
- Ever been up in one, Sarge?
- No.
Let's do something.
I can't stand this.
- Let's take a whack at it.
- Good idea.
- You know how to start it?
- No.
I don't know one jigger from the other.
All I know is horses.
- Sarge.
- Yeah?
I'm thinking... if we'd have rushed them, right off, the minute we got here...
What's the use of chewing the rag about something we might have done?
Right you are, Sarge.
Yeah, I know what you're thinking!
Perhaps I've done everything wrong.
Perhaps this, and perhaps that.
But what I've done, I've done!
And what I haven't, I haven't!
Sorry, Morelli.
Shouldn't fly off like that.
- I'm getting jumpy.
- That's all right, Sarge.
- Forget it. My fault.
- No, it's mine... because I...
Well, I blew up like that because...
Well, I've done all the thinking in this outfit.
Had to meet everything that came along.
My head was twisted silly, thinking.
- Good job you was with us.
- Thanks.
But the thing that gets me most... is being done in by them sneaking Arabs.
What does the war mean to them?
Might just as well be friendly.
Some are, some ain't.
- They'll get us all right.
- Yeah, but we'll get them, too, see.
That's all I want now.
That's the only idea I've got in here.
See, I'm thinking, Morelli.
That's all I've been doing.
All day and all night.
Thinking, thinking.
I've got an idea.
We're going out there, you and me.
Try and start it?
Don't be crazy. I said an idea.
I'll leave this behind.
- You stay here and cover me.
- Wait a minute, Sarge...
- I'll go along with you.
- You stay here.
No, Sarge.
I can tell you, I'm scared... scared of being alone, the last man, no one to talk to.
I'd go bug-house like him.
I couldn't stand it.
All right.
Leave it here. Come along.
- Leave it?
- Yes, I said leave it.
Come on.
Halt!
Sergeant Clegg.
What do you make that out to be?
Fire of some sort, sir.
How far do you think?
Five or six hours, sir.
Forward march!
Sergeant! Sergeant!
I thought I saw something moving out there!
Couldn't have been though, huh?
I'm getting jumpy.
No. No, it ain't that, Sarge.
I'm scared. Scared of being alone.
Scared to be the last man,
I gotta talk to somebody!
Well, we're alone now.
He's gone.
- Sanders?
- Yes.
Morelli, look!
Sanders, come on back here! Sanders!
Morelli!
Sanders, don't stick your head up there!
Sanders, what's wrong with you?
Morelli, come back! Let him go!
Stop walking, will you!
Come on, you swine!
Come and get me now!
Come and get me! Come on. Come on.
Come on, you swine!
Come on! Come on!
Quincannon, I got them!
Quincannon, Brown!
There they are! I got them!
Morelli, Pearson! Pearson, Morelli!
McKay, look! Look at them! l...
Full halt!
Been looking for you, Sergeant.
Where are your men?
Speak up, man. Where's your section?
English
- Thank you. That will be all, Moses.
- Yes, ma'am.
May I have some of those cookies, Miss Virgie?
Of course you may.
James Henry.
Serve these cookies to Master Harold and wipe his chin.
Yes, ma'am, Miss Virgie.
Another portion of ice cream for you, Miss Gladys?
No, thank you, I've had enough.
There ain't no more ice cream, Miss Virgie.
I'll only ask them once. I won't coax.
More cake or ice cream for you,
Master Philip?
Nothing more for me, thank you.
Would you care for more ice cream,
Master Harold?
Yes.
Perhaps you would rather have another nice, great big piece of cake.
No,just ice cream.
Is this for me?
Course not.
Serve it to young Master Harold.
Seems like he could've just reached over and took it... instead of this roundabout way.
That child of yours is certainly the perfect hostess.
She takes after her mother.
I can easily understand why you two worship her.
I'm afraid that's a failing common to all parents.
Listen, everyone. Listen!
How would you like to see Uncle Billy dance?
All right,James Henry.
Let's get going, son.
James Henry?
How about you dancing too?
Oh, no, ma'am, Miss Virgie.
The body is willing, but the feet just stays too close to the ground.
Come, dear. Excuse yourself for a moment.
Some other little friends want to see you.
Will you please excuse me for a minute?
Yes, Miss Virgie.
Now, you took some gumption and talk right out to Miss Virgie. Don't be scared.
Hello, Sally Anne.
Hello, Dinah.
- Hello.
- Go on now, Sally Anne.
Miss Virgie...
Please, ma'am...
We all done come here to wish you many happy -
- happy-
- Returns.
That's it!
Many happy returns of the day.
And we all done made you a doll, and here it is.
Miss Virgie, there was more
I had to say, but-
Mammy, I forgot it.
You said everything, Sally Anne.
Don't you worry.
This is the very nicest present I got.
Thank you ever so much.
Yes, indeed, children. It was very thoughtful and sweet. Come now, dear.
I'll see you later, and I'll save you some cake.
We'll be waiting!
I hope you'll excuse me, Miss Virgie... if I don't bow very low, but these britches are too tight.
That's perfectly all right, Master Harold.
Just bow as far as you can.
That's far enough.
Be careful.
- Captain Cary?
- There's Cary.
- Here.
Fort Sumter was fired on this morning, sir.
War is declared.
You are to present yourself at the armory immediately, sir, with horse and sidearms.
All men of the Richmond Graves report in the city before nightfall.
Captain Cary, send a slave down the valley to report the news.
I'm riding north among the river plantations.
Thank you, sir.
Hurrah!
Come on, boy.
Listen, you get the children.
I'll meet you outside at the carriage.
Isn't this terrible?
What are we going to do?
- I reckon I'd better get your things together.
- I'll leave as soon as I can.
Mrs. Cary, I think we ought to get the children home.
- The road may be filled with soldiers before night.
- That's true.
We'll be mobilizing tonight and tomorrow.
- Tom, get the carriages ready as quickly as you can.
- Yes, ma'am.
Come on, darling.
We've got to hurry.
Good-bye, Miss Virgie.
Wait for me!
Bye, Miss Virgie.
Bye, Miss Virgie.
Take him right away, boss.
There you go. Come on! Come on!
- Good-bye, Mr. Cary.
- Good-bye.
Come on here,Jimmy.
Hold it.
Uncle Billy...
I don't think it was very polite to chase everybody out of my party like that.
Their mammies have to get 'em home quick.
You see, honey child, there's going to be a war.
What's a war?
Well, a war is a lot of soldiers and battles... where men kill each other with guns.
Really and truly kill each other?
- Yes, ma'am.
- Why?
Seem like to me, honey, no one knows why.
I hear a white gentleman say there's a man up North who wants to free the slaves.
What does that mean,
"free the slaves''?
I don't know what it means myself.
It's funny, isn't it?
There's Daddy! It's Daddy!
My daddy's the best soldier in the whole army.
Ready, halt!
Company, march!
Oh,James Henry, you always do it wrong.
I see the Yankees here last week.
When they say " march,'' they starts.
When they say " halt,'' they stops.
Well, that's just why I do it different.
I wouldn't do anything those Yankees do!
Look! Here they come again,
Miss Virgie! Look!
- Come on!
- Come on, Miss Virgie! They might hurt you!
- Come on, Miss Virgie.
- I'm not going to run.
- They's liable to hurt you.
- I just won't budge.
- I'll show them I'm not afraid.
- I is!
- Ain't you a speck afraid, Miss Virgie?
- No, I'm not.
What are you afraid of them for?
Oh, honey child, them Yankees is mighty powerful.
They can even change the weather.
- Yes?
- Whenever they come around...
I never know whether it's winter or summer.
I'm shiverin' and sweatin' at the same time.
- Go and tell Mother they're coming.
- I think I better.
Troops, halt!
Good Lord, Miss Virgie!
You is startin' another war!
- Who did that?
- I did.
- Well, you're truthful anyway.
- My mommy and daddy taught me never to tell a lie.
They're right. Who are you?
- I'm a Confederate.
- So you're a little rebel, eh?
I'm not a rebel. My daddy said so.
I'm a Confederate.
- Your daddy a soldier?
- He's the best soldier in the whole world.
- Is he around here now?
- I wouldn't tell you if he was.
Got a lot of spunk, haven't you?
- Well, I'm not afraid of you.
- Well, I'm glad you're not.
I think it'd be awful if a nice, little girl like you were afraid of me.
Nevertheless, you better mind your manners, young lady... and don't use that slingshot again.
 I wish I was in Dixie
Hooray, hooray 
 In Dixieland I'll take my stand 
 To live and die in Dixie
Away, away 
 Away down South in Dixie
Away, away 
 Away down South in Dixie 
- Mommy?
- Yes, Virgie.
When is Daddy coming to see us again?
Oh, we can't tell, darling. He's a long distance away, and it's not so easy as it was.
- Why isn't it?
- Because we're in enemy territory now.
What does " enemy territory'' mean?
Well, it means that the Yankees have captured this land, and it doesn't belong to us anymore.
And every time that Daddy comes to see us, he has to cross through the enemy lines... and that's very dangerous.
I can't understand it.
I say my prayers every night... and I say a special prayer for Daddy to come and see us... but it doesn't seem to do any good.
So yesterday I started praying in the daytime too.
I prayed twice yesterday, and I prayed three times today.
I'm sure it'll work now, Mommy.
Here comes Daddy!
It's Daddy!
- Massa Cary.
- Uncle Billy.
Tears?
Joy!
Me too, Daddy. Look.
Southerners never cry.
- Oh, what are these things then?
- Raindrops.
- On a sunshiny day? Aww!
- Ohh!
Can you stay long this time, Daddy?
Not this time either, darling.
I have to get right on.
I'll see if Rosabelle has your lunch ready.
- Are they getting a fresh horse for me?
- Everybody knows just what to do.
- We practice it every day.
- Oh, God love you!
Miss Virgie,
I brought you some water and a towel.
- I thought maybe Massa Cary would like to wash his face.
- Thank you,James Henry.
Didn't nobody tell me to do it either.
I thought of it all by myself.
Well, you must be thinking better than you used to,James Henry.
Yes, sir, Massa Cary.
I even think more often now.
-James Henry!
- Yes, Miss Virgie?
Didn't I tell you to bring this water?
That's right. It was you.
I thought it was Uncle Billy.
What was that I thunk up all by myself?
Oh, yes. I was gonna polish
Massa Cary's boots.
Didn't nobody tell me to do that, did they?
Never mind my boots,James Henry.
Go water my horse.
Yes, sir, Massa Cary.
Daddy?
Are we winning the war?
Well, things are going along.
- Will it last much longer?
- Mm, I hope not.
- Do you have to work hard in the war?
- We all have to do our share.
Every time I see you you're always so tired.
Well, I'm not tired now.
You're giving me new strength.
I miss you, Daddy.
Do you miss me?
Indeed I do.
You know when I miss you the most?
At twilight when you used to sing to me.
Let's pretend it's twilight now, Daddy.
Now, you just close your eyes and make out you're tired, and I'll sing to you now.
Why, I was humming in my sleep.
Aw, you were not!
Tom's bringing up another horse.
- That's fine. Oh, Tom?
- Yes, sir, Massa Cary?
- Give him some water and fill those saddlebags with oats.
- Yes, sir, Massa Cary.
I'll go to the stables for you, Daddy.
I can run faster.
I'd better get going while the coast is clear.
I've got to find out... where Sheridan's army's camping and report to General Lee before nightfall.
I'm so worried about you on these scouting expeditions.
If they catch you, you'll be shot as a spy.
As long as they don't find any dispatches on me, and I'm not wearing a Yankee uniform...
- I'd only be arrested as a prisoner of war.
- As if that weren't bad enough.
- Please be careful.
- You know I will.
- I'll push. It'll make you go faster.
- Oh, go on now.
- Go on, hurry!
- Oh!
- How is she, Uncle Billy?
- Oh, fine, Massa Cary. Fine, sir.
We's only got two left, but they both good, sir.
Two left?
Well, I've had to sell or trade nearly all the stock for food- that is, all that weren't stolen.
I've saved the horses till the last, knowing you might need them.
- Why didn't you tell me?
- This is the part of the war we women must fight, darling.
Push me!
I pushed the oats all the way from the stables, Daddy.
It's a wonder this lazy jackass didn't eat 'em up on the way.
Go on back to that stable, boy.
Yankees, Massa Cary!
Yankees! They's comin'!
Go ahead, son. I got him.
Good-bye, darling.
Don't be afraid.
Please be careful.
- Good-bye, honey.
- Oh, Daddy.
Come on, darling.
Daddy has to hurry.
Let's see you smile.
Oh, that's only a half o' one.
Come on now.
Give Daddy a grand, big fat smile.
Oh, that's fine.
Come on, Massa Cary.
Hurry, please, sir.
I'll try to cross the river the other side of the old mill. I can hide in the woods.
I'll fire three quick shots to let you know I'm safe.
Keep them here long as you can.
I'll need the time. Good-bye.
- God ride with you, darling.
- Oh, Daddy?
- Yes, dear?
- Give all my love to General Lee.
I will, honey.
Seth! Seth!
Where's them Yankees at?
They're just turning off the main road.
- Get that corn from the barn into the house.
- Yes, sir.
Quick!
I can carry two, Rosabelle.
There you is, child.
Come on, children.
Come on. Hurry.
- Are they in sight yet?
- No, ma'am, Missa Cary.
- Here, you put this away. I'll watch.
- Yes, ma'am.
Come on. Come on, hurry.
Uncle Billy!
Here they come!
Here they come!
Rosabelle, get in the drawing room and start sewing just like you surprised to see 'em.
- Yes, Uncle Billy.
- The rest of you, out in the stable, quick.
Uncle Billy, do you think the Yankees will find us in the secret room?
Don't you be a-scared, child.
There ain't nothing to worry about.
- There is somethin' to worry about if you's white.
- What you mean?
They won't hurt us, 'cause we's slaves.
They's fightin' for us.
But if you's white and Southern, then you's the enemy.
Oh, don't pay him no mind.
Go on, children. Get in there and hide.
All right, Uncle Billy.
Get in now. You too young to see anything that may happen.
- What's the matter, Miss Virgie?
- My dress is caught.
For a man they ain't gonna hurt... you do a powerful lot of shivering every time the Yankees comes around.
My mind says they ain't gonna hurt me, but my body don't believe it.
Aahh!
- Where's Missa Cary?
- I don't know. I ain't seen her.
- Stand up, you!
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
We're looking for a spy.
Is there a rebel hiding in this house?
No, sir. No, sir, Massa General.
Nobody at all, sir.
- Who lives here?
- Missa Cary, sir.
- Is she married?
- Yes, sir.
- Where's her husband?
- I-
- Is he a rebel?
- I-
- Is he a rebel?
- He's away in the war, sir.
In the Confederate Army?
- Yes, sir.
- Where is she?
She's around, but I don't know where, sir.
Search the house, men.
She's hiding someone.
- If she wasn't, she'd be here.
- Yes, sir. Come on, men.
Barnes, Lorny, Robinson, upstairs.
The rest of you men take the lower floor.
- Start in back. Mason, deploy all your men.
- Yes, sir.
- Bring me a drink.
- We ain't got nothin', sir, 'cepting apple cider.
- Well, bring me that.
- Yes, sir, Massa General.
- You, get me something to eat.
- We ain't got-
- Get me something to eat!
- I'll try, sir.
Here's something, men.
Keep it covered.
Yes, sir, I was just on my way out.
What were you doing in that closet?
I-I went in there to get me some air.
Oh, you go into a dark closet to get air, do you?
Yes, sir. You see, I'm a man who likes to change his air.
I gets tired of regular old air.
So every little once in a while,
I go in someplace... and get me some good closet air.
Come on, come on. Get out of here.
Search it, men.
- Nobody back there, sir.
- Any trapdoors in the floor?
- Couldn't find any, sir.
- Well, keep your eyes open.
- Yes, sir.
- Watch for secret panels.
These houses all have 'em.
- Why did you drop that pitcher?
- It just slipped off the tray, sir.
Slipped, eh? It slipped when I said something about secret panels.
- That's when it slipped, didn't it?
- I didn't hear you say it, sir.
- Now listen, you-
- Sergeant!
- Sergeant!
- Find anything?
These oats out in front, and the ground nearby was wet... as though a horse had been watered and the saddlebags filled.
These oats ain't been there 1 0 minutes.
The sun hasn't turned 'em yet.
Search the stables and rush some men down to the river near that old mill.
- That's where he'll cross ifhe gets away.
- Yes, sir.
Come on, boys.
Here, take this to the kitchen and get the general some more cider.
- Sergeant.
- Find anything?
- Nothing up there.
- There's a trapdoor in the kitchen.
I'm gonna find out what's under it.
- Did you find anything?
- Let's look around-
What are you doing glued to that wall?
You've been lying. Now, come on.
I've got something!
Look at this.
There must be somebody in there.
- It's a secret panel.
- It ain't nothing, sir.
- Open it.
- It's just a wall, sir.
- Bust it in.
- Wait a minute. I'll open it.
It's just two little babies in there.
That's all.
Well, this ain't much to get excited about.
Nothing to eat, eh? And no liquor?
Well, this is pretty good.
Hurry up.
Get out ofhere. Come on.
Come on. Get out of here.
Hurry up.
Get one of those hams and have it cooked.
- Yes, sir.
- You boys can get yourselves a couple of drinks too.
Yes, sir!
Ah, right down the scuppers.
Come here, you.
Pull off these boots.
Why, you little black rascal!
I'll tan your hide for this!
- Come here, you little rascal!
- You let me go! You let me go!
White, by gad!
Who told you to put that black on?
I guess your daddy told you to do it.
Your daddy's a soldier, isn't he?
Why, I wouldn't hurt a little girl like you.
Maybe you'll tell me where your daddy is.
I'd like to talk to him.
Come here, you!
- She didn't mean nothing, master.
- Don't you dare touch that child!
- Turn me loose!
- Mother! Mother!
- Run, Virgie, run!
- Let me go!
Mother! Mother!
I didn't mean to shove ya.
Don't you hurt my mother!
Don't you dare hurt my mother!
- You let her alone! Attention!
What's going on here?
Are you hurt, madam?
No.
- Who's in command here?
- I am, sir.
Do you know what he did?
He broke our table, and he wanted to hurt me, and he threw my mommy down the stairs.
Put that loot back where you got it.
- Lieutenant Harte.
- Yes, sir.
Take him outside and give him 25 lashes.
Beat him till he bleeds.
Investigate the others. If you find any of them guilty, give them five lashes each.
Yes, sir. Come on, Dudley.
I can't tell you how sorry I am, madam.
And you too, miss.
- Why, you were crying, weren't you?
- Not very much.
You look like you've been climbing up the chimney.
Your men were the cause of it.
Just wait till I tell my Daddy about this.
He'll go and kill your whole Yankee army!
And I won't blame him a bit.
Blow.
Thank you.
Now you run along and play.
There's a rebel scout, madam, known to be in this neighborhood.
I'm sorry to have to question you after what's already occurred, but it's necessary.
- I know nothing of him.
- I happen to know that you do. He's your husband.
- Have you seen him today?
- No.
Would you tell me if you had?
Would you expect me to?
I'm afraid not.
- What is it, Sergeant?
- We found a horse in a corral half a mile below here, sir.
Shows signs ofhaving been ridden hard a short while ago.
He changed horses here.
Send five men to the river.
Put two sharpshooters on the roof of that old mill so they can cover both banks.
Yes, sir.
What's that?
A godsend.
In that case, I'm afraid there's no longer any necessity for my staying.
Good day, madam.
And good day to you, you little rebel.
- Sergeant!
- Yes, sir?
Countermand that order.
He's already across.
- All right, we're going back to camp.
- Yes, sir.
Come in!
I don't think we should stay here a second longer, Missa Cary.
The Yankees is already down by the east pasture, and we's right in the line of fire.
You better hurry.
The shells is droppin' in the yard now.
Please, hurry.
Don't be afraid.
- Uncle Billy, can't we get to the slaves' quarters?
- No, ma'am.
They's firin' there now.
Excuse me, Captain.
One of your slaves is outside.
Wants to see you. He says it's very important.
- What? One of my slaves?
- Yes, sir.
- How could he have gotten through the Yankee lines? Send him in.
- Yes, sir.
Oh, Massa Cary, thanks the Lord I found you, sir.
- What is it, Uncle Billy?
- Missa Cary, she's awful sick, sir.
- Sick?
- Yes, sir. I's afraid, Massa Cary. I's afraid, sir.
She keeps asking for you all the time.
- What happened?
- Sir, they fought right in front of the house.
The house was burned down.
Missa Cary, she catch her death of cold.
She's coughing bad.
How long has this been going on?
She was sick for three weeks and gettin' worse.
Then I decided I better fetch you.
I been going from camp to camp looking for you for over a week now.
- Most of the slaves run away.
- And Virgie- How's little Virgie?
Oh, she's fine, sir.
Never complain about nothing and always cheerful.
She's been a great comfort to Missa Cary.
But I's afraid Missa Cary needs you now, sir.
- I'll get a leave of absence right away.
- Yes, sir.
I've got some logs in the river covered with brush.
We can float down past the Union camps, then cut inland 'cross through the Chickahominy Swamp.
- Well, hurry. We'll have to get into the swamp before daybreak.
- Yes, sir.
Here's the Union camp now, sir.
It's only an hour before daylight.
- Do you think we can do it, Massa Cary?
- Well, we can try. Come on.
You're feeling better now, aren't you, Mommy?
Yes, dear, much better.
I bet it won't be long before Daddy is here.
He'll make everything all right.
You'll see.
We-We mustn't be too sure, darling.
Then we won't be so disappointed if he doesn't get here.
Perhaps Uncle Billy didn't get through the Yankee lines.
Uncle Billy can do anything.
He can sing and dance and climb trees... and do everything in the world.
I know he can bring Daddy back.
Now, I have my housework to do... so you just lie quiet until I finish.
Mother's very proud of you, darling.
I'll be right back.
Rosabelle, you're crying.
No, Miss Virgie, I ain't cryin', child.
My eyes just kinda slipped.
Well, my daddy will be here soon... and then your eyes won't have to slip.
Yes'm, Miss Virgie.
What are you doing there,
James Henry?
Well, I sleeps in that kitchen... and I wants to hear them Yankees when they's a-comin'... so I dug this hole.
I's gonna cover it over, so when they walks across it... they'll fall in, but they'll make a heap of noise.
And then I'll hear 'em, and I'll start runnin'.
- I hope nobody else falls in it.
- Yes, ma'am.
Look!
Here comes Uncle Billy now!
But he didn't bring Daddy.
- Here comes Daddy!
- Massa Cary's comin'!
- Praise the Lord!
- Daddy! Daddy!
My darling.
Praise the Lord, Missa Cary.
He does come!
The whole Yankee army couldn't stop him.
He's done come.
Thank heaven.
I had to live till you got here and I knew Virgie'd be safe.
Please don't talk like that, dear.
Didn't I tell you that Uncle Billy would find him, Mommy?
Yes, dear.
I bet now that Daddy is here... it won't be long before we have a great big house again.
- Will it, Daddy?
- No, darling.
Oh, Daddy, I wish Mommy didn't have to be sick.
Shh. You've got to be a brave little girl, darling.
Well, can't I be brave and wish Mommy wasn't sick too?
Of course, Virgie.
Mother isn't going to be sick much longer now.
She's going to sleep, darling.
And if there are dreams in that... sleep... oh, my darlings... how I'll dream of you.
Oh, Daddy,
I had a dream last night.
I dreamed Mommy and you were putting me to bed.
And do you remember how you used to tell me fairy tales?
- Come on, honey child.
- First Mother-
What is it, Uncle Billy?
What's the matter, Uncle Billy?
Why does everybody act so funny?
Is something wrong?
No, honey child.
There is something wrong.
Is it about my mommy?
Daddy, what is it?
Did something happen to my mommy?
Something very beautiful, darling.
That's how you must always think of it- that Mama'll never be ill again... or frightened or discouraged.
She'll never suffer anymore.
Just-Just think of it... as beautiful.
- Daddy?
- Yes, honey.
You won't ever leave me, will you?
No, I'll never let you out of my arms again.
- Uncle Billy.
- Yes, Massa Cary?
There hasn't been a Yankee patrol through here since morning.
There's bound to be one soon.
Get Miss Virgie's things ready.
- You mean, you're gonna take
Miss Virgie with you, Massa Cary?
- Yes.
- Through the Yankee line?
- I've got to get her to my sister in Richmond.
- But, Captain, it's dangerous. You can't do it, sir.
- Yankees, Daddy!
All of you go back to your cabins, but don't hurry.
Rosabelle, you go with them and see that they don't talk.
- Uncle Billy, you wait outside and watch.
- Yes, sir.
- Come, honey.
- Don't talk now.
Well, I didn't know-
I didn't know that hole was there.
Honey, do you remember how Mama always taught you never to tell a lie?
- Oh, I never have, Daddy.
- I know, and Mama's proud of you for it.
But if those Yankees should come in here, you've got to tell them a lie.
- You want me to tell a lie?
-Just this once, honey, for Daddy's sake.
And in a case like this, it really isn't a lie.
If they should stop here and they ask you... tell them I was here but I left an hour ago, and you saw me cross the river.
Now be a brave little Confederate, darling.
Do this for me.
- Daddy.
- Hmm?
- Would General Lee want me to tell that lie?
- Yes, dear, this once.
All right, then
I'll tell a whopper.
They's comin', Massa Cary!
Here, help me with this.
Don't be frightened.
Act as though you didn't know they were here.
All right, Massa Cary.
Put that table back up against the wall.
Remember now, act as though nothing had occurred. Dance or play or something.
We will, Daddy.
- What you all doin'?
- You got your mouth organ?
- Yeah.
- Well, get ready to use it.
Sergeant, take your men and search that wood.
Cary's around here, and this time we've got to get him. He's given us the slip long enough.
- Hurry now. Move fast.
- Yes, sir.
All right, men, let's go.
Well, that was quite a concert.
And how is the littlest rebel of them all?
Fine, Yankee.Just fine.
Do you mind if I warm my hands at your fire?
No, sir.
- You two all alone here?
- Yes, sir.
Yes, sir. My daddy was here, but he left an hour ago.
- Is that so?
- Yes, sir. He was here.. . but he left an hour ago, and I saw him cross the river.
Well, now, that's very interesting.
I know another dance.
Oh, yes, sir.
She know a lot of dances.
Now, dance for the gentlemen, honey child.
What was your father doing here?
My mommy was very sick, and she kept asking for Daddy.
So yesterday Uncle Billy brought him... and this morning my mommy went away.
- Is that true?
- Yes, sir.
I'm sorry.
But my daddy says I must always think of it as beautiful.
Your daddy's right. You see,
I have a little girl, too,just about your age... and I'd feel awful sorry if her mommy went away.
- Has your little girl got a pony?
- And a cart.
Does she get enough to eat and everything?
You had the table out in the center of the room, eh?
- No, sir.
- No, sir.
- What are those tracks?
- I made them with my foot.
Is that a trapdoor in the ceiling there?
No, sir. There ain't nothing up there.
Nothing at all, sir.
- You've been lying to me.
- No, sir, I haven't.
- Your father's here now!
- No, sir, he isn't!
- You know he is!
- He was here, but he left an hour ago.
- I saw him cross the river.
- You tell me the truth, or I'll give you the worst-
-Just a minute!
- Drop your pistol.
Now, come down and keep your hands up.
Back over against that door.
Turn around and keep those hands up.
Daddy.
All right, you can drop them now, but no funny business.
Oh, Daddy, I didn't do it right, did I?
Yes, you did, darling.
Daddy's proud of you.
I said just what you told me to.
You were perfect, and I was only fooling about the whipping.
I really wasn't going to.
Run outside, darling.
Daddy'll call you.
Come on, Uncle Billy.
Can you arrange so that my arrest won't frighten her?
- I'll try.
- Thanks.
- Any papers on you?
- No, I'm not scouting this trip, Colonel.
I came home to bury my dead... and take my little girl to
Richmond, where my sister is.
I see.
Well, come on.
Let's get it over with.
I'm afraid I won't be able to- to bid my little girl good-bye.
I understand.
Will you tell her
I've gone back to General Lee?
I'll return soon.
- Yes, it would just about fit.
- What?
- The Yankee uniform.
- What do you mean?
- You know the Cartwright plantation?
- Well.
I left a uniform there to be mended by the slaves.
If you stole that uniform,
I don't know how I could stop you.
- You mean-
- If you were wearing a Union uniform... and had a pass through the lines... you'd stand a mighty good chance of making Richmond.
- Where would I get a pass?
- From me.
I don't think my country expects me to make war on babies.
I don't know what to say.
Of course, you realize what it means if you're caught in my uniform.
Aren't you taking an awful chance yourself, Colonel?
War's full of chances.
I won't forget this.
I hope you get through.
- God bless you.
- There's just one thing I ask.
In passing through our lines, whatever you see or hear, forget.
My word of honor.
Daddy, Daddy!
The soldiers are coming back!
Get out the back way.
Follow the woods to the Cartwrights'.
Daddy, is the Yankee man gonna be nice?
A man couldn't be nicer than he's been.
You see, you've made me think of my little girl.
- I knew all the time you weren't gonna whip me.
- Come on. We've got to hurry.
Good luck.
You're nice enough to be a Confederate.
Good-bye, Uncle Billy.
- Any sign of him?
- Not a thing, Colonel.
Well, you men better come in and warm up.
There's a fire in here.
Yes, sir.
- No trace at all, eh?
- No.
But I'm sure he's still around here.
They buried his wife just an hour ago.
Look! There goes somebody.
- A man and a child?
- Yes. They're headed for the woods.
That's a slave and his pickaninny.
They just left here. They're all right.
- Do you hear anything?
- Horses. Listen.
We've got to go back.
Didn't the man give you a paper to show them, Daddy?
Yes, but the Yanks around here may recognize me.
I don't want to use the pass until we get out of this neighborhood.
This isn't a good neighborhood anyway.
No. Come on.
- Halt!
- Whoa!
- Where are you going, sir?
- I'm taking this child to her father just beyond our lines.
Colonel Morrison sent me.
Here's a pass.
Have you got a little girl, mister?
No, I've got a boy.
- Where'd you come from?
- Cary's plantation. Left there at noon.
- Why aren't you using the main road?
- Full of artillery.
How old is your little boy?
- Five.
- Oh, I'm six.
- My boy's bigger than you.
- He is?
Yes. This looks all right, but I don't know.
We've got special orders to be on the watch for Captain Cary, a rebel scout.
Didn't you hear?
They caught him this morning.
- They did?
- Yeah, Morrison's men, at his own plantation.
- What's your regiment?
- 72nd Vermont.
It's all right then. You'll find them camped just a mile below here. Go ahead.
Thanks.
Oh, Daddy, you told a fib.
Well, this is war, honey.
Why isn't it a sin to tell a fib in war?
I don't know why it isn't a sin to do any of the things we do in war.
What's the 72nd Vermont?
Well, that's a regiment of soldiers
I have no intention of meeting.
Halt!
Colonel Morrison asked me to take this child to Greensburg.
- Here's his pass.
- Colonel Morrison?
- Yes.
- Where was he?
Cary plantation, about 1 8 miles south ofhere.
- When did you leave there?
- Why-
- We left there at 1 2:00.
- Why, you know all the answers too, huh?
Yes, sir. I'm six years old.
Well, I guess you're all right.
Go ahead.
Wait a minute!
I wanna see that kid!
- Whose child is this?
- Friend of Colonel Morrison's.
- Ever see me before?
- No.
Ya didn't, eh?
Don't you remember the shoe polish?
- No!
- Well, I do.
Her old man's the most dangerous scout in the rebel army.
This looks mighty funny to me.
Go get 'em! Hurry up!
Head 'em off!
Take the lower road!
Get under the seat quick, honey.
Halt!
Keep your hands up.
Are you armed?
- No.
- Let's see.
All right, we'll go back.
Follow us.
- Captain?
- Yes.
- I'm afraid I've got to give you some bad news.
- The appeal was denied, huh?
Every finding of the court-martial was upheld.
- That means-
- Yes.
When does the... party take place?
The morning of the 27 th... at dawn.
Well, I still have six days.
Any messages you want sent?
I'll be glad to do anything I can, Captain.
You've been very kind... especially so in getting Uncle Billy here to look after my little girl.
- I appreciate that.
- I wish there was something
I could really do, Captain.
That child has literally captured us all.
- Colonel-
- Yes, I know.
I heard you.
No chance at all, eh?
No.
And is my little party set for the morning of the 27 th too?
I'm sorry, Colonel.
He's innocent, Major.
All he did was try to help a child.
The evidence we couldn't overcome,
Colonel... was the fact that you not only gave him a pass but that he was wearing your uniform.
- I stole that uniform.
- We couldn't make them believe that.
I had hoped we could.
I'll be about, Colonel, if there's anything you want done.
Thank you, Major.
Well, it was a gamble, and we lost.
I have no regrets.
When I think of my own little baby,
I'd do the same thing over again.
Why is a shoe called a shoe?
What?
I says, why is a shoe called a shoe?
What do you mean, why is a shoe called a shoe?
Well, the world is full of names.
They could have picked out any other name.
- Who could?
- Whoever did.
- I don't know who it was.
- Man, what are you talkin' about?
Why is a shoe called a shoe?
Massa Cary says that shows you got brains when you're thinkin' 'bout things.
I spent all day yesterday thinkin', why is a horse called a horse?
Aw, shut your mouth, will you?
What time is it now, Uncle Billy?
I heard the town clock strike 3:00 a while back, Miss Virgie.
Oh, we'll have to hurry.
Daddy always expects me at 3:30.
He says it makes his afternoon seem shorter.
There. That's done.
Shall I brush your clothes now, honey child?
Yes, please.
Do you think they'll keep Daddy locked up in that place long, Uncle Billy?
No, ma'am.
I'm afraid they won't, honey.
You're afraid?
You don't want my daddy-
Oh, no, no, child.
I expects they take him out pretty soon now.
Last night when I said my prayers...
I asked God to let Daddy out of there... and- and I asked him for a new dress too.
Then I thought maybe that was too much to ask... so I told God he didn't have to bother about the dress.
- Was that right, Uncle Billy?
- Yes, that was right, honey.
But if you want that dress...
I'll kinda slip a little hint in my prayers tonight.
Now, Uncle Billy, if you look sad when we get there... like you did yesterday,
I'll never take you again.
No, ma'am, I won't.
We've got to smile, so Daddy will think we're happy.
I will, honey. You'll see.
You ready now?
Yes, all ready.
James Henry, you wait here until we get back.
Yes, sir.
Did you like it, Daddy?
You have charge of Captain Cary's little girl, haven't you?
Yes, sir.
I is one of his slaves, sir.
- I want to speak to you a moment.
- Yes, sir.
That was lovely, darling.
Come on now, and tell me what you've been doing.
Oh, I sewed up a hole in my dress.
Mrs. Robin let me sweep the stoop.
- Why, you're becoming a regular, little housewife.
- Daddy?
- Hmm?
- When are they gonna let you out?
No, no. Come on now.
Tell me what you've been doing.
Well, there's a little girl lives across the street... and she has a pony, and she let me ride on it.
- That's grand.
- And she gave me some candy, and she's a Yank.
And she said she didn't care whether I was a rebel or not... and I said I didn't care whether she was a Yank.
Even if there is a war, she was awfully nice to me.
- Daddy?
- Yes.
When she was so nice, and Colonel Morrison's so nice, and Mrs. Robin... why do the rest of the people have to kill each other?
I don't know, honey.
We grown-ups haven't as much sense as you children.
This isn't money enough, but it's all I can spare.
I'll give you a letter to him.
He may help you. I don't know.
Thank you, sir. Thank you.
You've got four days to try it in.
It's worth taking the chance.
God bless you.
I'll start right now, sir.
- Daddy?
- Yes, dear.
- I don't want to leave.
- Perhaps you'd better.
Tomorrow you can come again.
You're not leaving without saying good-bye to me, are you?
Oh, no.
I was gonna kiss you good-bye.
Then tomorrow when I come,
I'll do all the talking with you.
Oh, you switch around, eh?
Well, Daddy said you tried to help us, so I make you my second daddy.
Nothing so nice ever happened to me.
We gotta hurry, missy.
Good-bye, Yankee.
Good-bye, rebel darling.
Good-bye, Daddy.
- God love you, honey.
- I'll come tomorrow.
- All right, sweetheart.
- Good-bye, Massa Cary.
- Good-bye, Billy.
- Good-bye, Colonel Morrison, sir.
- Bye.
- Good-bye, darling.
- Good-bye.
- Bye.
Uncle Billy, isn't there any way we can get them out of there?
Honey, that soldier man give me some money.
He's gonna write me a letter to give to a judge up in Washington.
He said there's just one way... but I don't know if we got enough money to get there.
Please, sir, how much is the railroad fare for a colored man to Washington?
Six dollars and 20 cents.
And how much for the little girl, sir?
Ah, she's a little too tall for half fare.
Oh, no, I'm not.
I'm standing on my toes.
This is my right size.
All right.
It'll be $9.60 for you, first class.
Thank you, sir.
- Have you got enough?
- No, child.
It's gonna take more money than what we got.
How do people get money?
I know how to get some more money.
Come on, honey child.
Help the cause, white folks.
It's for the cause.
- Which cause?
- The-The right cause.
Thank you. Thank you.
I don't put no money in the Confederate cap.
There you are, boss.
I brung this along just in case.
- Oh, well, that's-
- Thank you.
Here, give me that.
This makes 44, 45, 46, 56.
Bless the Lord. Praise the Lord.
We got enough now, honey, for railroad fare.
Come on, child.
- You may go in now.
- Thank you, sir.
Come on, Uncle Billy.
Come right in.
Miss Virginia Cary and Uncle Billy?
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir, Mr. President.
How do you do, my dear?
Very nicely. Thank you, sir.
And how are you, Uncle Billy?
Let me see.
Judge Van Allen told me about this case.
Yes, sir. He's the gentleman the soldier man sent me to.
Come over here.
Tell me all about it.
There. Now... that's nicer.
My daddy and Colonel Morrison are in prison... and they're going to shoot them.
Your father is a captain in the Confederate Army.
Yes, sir.
Arrested as a spy.
My daddy isn't a spy!
Do you know what a spy is?
I know it's something bad, because they shoot you for it... and my daddy couldn't do anything bad.
I don't see how he could either... with a little one like you.
Thank you kindly, sir.
Tell me about it.
My daddy went away to the war... and then the Yankees came around to our house... and sometimes my daddy came home.
- Was he in uniform?
- Yes, sir.
- What color?
- Gray.
I see.
Thank you, sir.
Then there were so many Yankees around... my daddy couldn't come home anymore.
Then they burnt down our house, and my mommy got sick... and had to go to bed in Uncle Billy's cabin.
No, that's yours.
I had the last piece.
That's right.
We had nothing to get her medicine with,
Mr. President.
The soldiers took most everything we had.
And Mommy kept asking for my daddy.
All the time she'd ask.
No, that's mine.
You had the last piece.
- I beg your pardon.
- You forgot. That's all.
So Uncle Billy went and brought my daddy back home.
The next day, my mommy went away.
There, there. Don't cry.
You're a great big girl.
You mustn't cry.
- I won't.
- What happened next?
Then the Yankees came, and my daddy had to hide in the garret.
Then Colonel Morrison came in.
He talked to me.
He's awfully nice.
He has a little girl, too,just my age.
Then he found Daddy, and Daddy told him... about wanting to take me to my
Aunt Caroline in Richmond... so I could get enough to eat.
That's why the colonel give
Massa Cary the pass, sir- just so he could bring Miss Virgie where she could be taken care of.
I see. Now, on this trip... before your daddy was captured... did he write down anything on paper or anything?
- No, sir.
- Did he ever stop and look at the Yankee soldiers... or count them or look at the cannons?
No, sir. He told me that if we got to Richmond... and anyone asked me what I had seen...
I was in honor bound not to tell them.
- He told you that?
- Yes, sir.
Because Colonel Morrison asked him not to see anything... and my daddy gave his word, and they shook hands.
- John.
- Yes, Mr. President?
- Mr. President?
- Yes, Miss Virgie.
You won't let them shoot my daddy and Colonel Morrison, will you?
- Rush this by special courier to General Grant.
- Yes, Mr. President.
- Is this yours?
- No, it's yours.
I had the last piece.
There, there now.
All your terrible fears are over.
Your father and Colonel Morrison are going free.
