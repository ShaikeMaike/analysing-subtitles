Oh, the old oaken bucket
Bucket
The iron-bound bucket
Oh, bucket
The moss-covered bucket
George. George!
That hangs in the well
I think it was pretty meanof you to drag us out and leaveall our guests flat.
Oh, you didn't drag us out?
Well, I didn't invite them.
You didn't even know them?
They've only been there for three days.
George. George!
Wait a minute. I'll be back in a minute, honey.
What do you want?
What time is it?
Huh?
I said, where we going?
That isn't what you said before.
Oh, we're going to Wall Street to see Old Man Topper.
Iron-bound Topper 
That moss-covered Topper
That I promised to meet him at his bank for the annual meeting.
Of the board of directors at 10:30 in the morning.
Too many words, honey.
Yeah, that's what I thought.
Well, let's see.
It's 10:00 now.
Yep.
And it takes a half an hour to drive in.
Yep.
And the meeting's at 10:30 in the morning.
Mm-hmm.
That leaves 12 hours for-- for a night of complete rest.
Yes!
Mm-hmm. So this is how one starts getting a night's rest?
My pet, resting is the sort of thing you've gotta work up to gradually.
Oh, excuse me.
It's very dangerous to rest all of a sudden.
Come on, darling.
Mr. Kerby is here. Hurry.
Yes, sir.
Good evening,
Mrs. Kerby.
Hello, Joe.
We have a nice big size table for you.
Over there.
Hi, Mac.
Hello, George.
How are you, George?
[ Mutters ]
Thank you, Harry.
Good evening,
Mrs. Kerby.
Hello, George.
Come on.
The music's swell.
What?
I said, "The music's swell!"
Can't hear you, but that's good music.
That's what I said.
May I cut in?
Is this the way in?
Looks like it.
Well, how do we get out?
Honey, you slide in and they carry you out.
Oh, no.
Where I go, you go.
No, hey, wait for me.
Hup!
Don't forget to write.
[ Screams ]
[ Guests Laughing ]
Gentle George.
Deceitful George.
Yeah!
- Old Man Moon wake up now -
Quiet!
- 'Cause I've fallen in love -
- Go spread the news to all the stars -
- Above -
- Shine for my baby while we're dancing -
- Tonight -
- And fill her tender eyes with love -
- And dynamite -
- Yeah, and look at the time.
Look at the time.
Old Man Moon puts stardust -
- In a bottle of wine. -
- Just do your darnedest to make sure -
- that she'll be mine -
Please, Mr. Kerby.
- And if it's possible to keep shining till noon -
Bring your party home, please.
My sincerest thanks to you, sir
- Old Man Moon -
Look, Mr. Kerby, you are my best customer.
And I appreciate that.
Maybe you got no home.
Maybe you don't need sleep.
But me, I have a home... and I need to have-a some sleep!
All right, Tony.
Just one more chorus.
You're telling me the same story for the last hour.
I get-a sick and tired of hearing that song over and over again!
- With love or dynamite -
- Old Man Moon keeps stardust in a bottle of wine -
- Just do your darnedest to make sure -
Yes, good night!
- That she'll be mine -
Maybe the poor man's tired.
I don't know why he should be tired.
We did all the singing.
- And if it's possible to keep shining till noon -
- My sincerest thanks to you, sir -
- Old Man Moon -
- Old Man Moon
Old Man Moon -
- Good night, buddy!
- So long. See you next time.
Come on. Enough of it.
My sincerest thanks to you, sir
Get in, honey.
You get in, darling.
Ah, Jimmy. Did we keep you waiting long?
- Oh, that's all right.
- My sincerest thanks to you, sir.
Wilson!
- Old Man Wilson
Old Man Wilson -
- Old Man Wilson, that squares us up for the whole week.
- Right, Mr. Kerby.
Hey, George, is this
No, this is Topper's bank.
Oh.
Honey, do me a favor.
What?
Shut my eyes.
I'll shut your mouth.
Good night, my pet.
Good night.
Hey, hey, hey.
Oh, hello. You going to a costume ball?
What do you think this is, an auto camp?
Crosspatch, crosspatch.
Get out of here.
You can't sleep here.
I'm not sleeping.
Talk to him about it.
He seems to be doing it all.
Oh, hush, Marion.
Who have you dug up now?
I didn't dig him up.
He dug us up.
Make him go away.
I can't. It's a C-O-P.
C-O-P? Oh!
Tell him we don't want any.
Hey, hey, hey!
Flies.
Get out of here.
Now you can't sleep here.
Uh, we're not sleeping.
We're waiting.
Waitin' for what?
For-For-- For the annual meeting of the board of directors of that there bank.
Oh, darn.
There's nobody in there.
Maybe they're late.
"Maybe they're late."
You see, you can't argue with him.
I can't, eh?
Now I wanna tell you something--
See what you can do with this instead.
Well, of all the-- Oh!
Temper.
It's three minutes after 8:00, sir.
Oh, all right, Wilkins.
Do you realize that most men don't get chased out of the water like trained seals?
Most men can dawdle in their shower.
You are not most men, sir.
Why can't I be most men?
Because you are
Mr. Topper, sir.
And Mrs. Topper insists.
It's four minutes past.
We dress now.
We dress now, yeah.
Good morning, Clara.
Good morning, dear.
You're late.
Oh, better late than never.
Only 44 seconds anyhow.
Can't that fella wait until I tell him what I want?
Because you always have the same thing.
Supposing one morning
I were to take a notion to battle a trout... or some oatmeal or something?
Where would we be then?
Don't be silly.
I've taken great pains to arrange your diet properly.
You need sulphur, and eggs have sulphur.
Don't dally, dear.
James tells me you had to run for the train yesterday.
I did. I ran fast too.
I caught the very last step.
The very last step?
Outrageous.
What is outrageous about running for a train, dear?
Lots of men do it.
Yes, clerks and bookkeepers who come to the depot in a bus to catch the 7:45.
But for the president of the bank to arrive in a limousine... to take the banker's special, and then to run all over the platform like a silly chicken.
I didn't run like a silly chicken.
I ran beautifully.
Besides, you know how you puff when you run.
Of course I puff.
Everybody puffs.
You puff yourself, Clara.
I remember that day--
Cosmo, please.
Don't be vulgar.
Sorry, dear.
And I don't care if you are well-preserved for your age.
You look anything but dignified when you run.
And I won't have you climbing aboard the banker's special all out of breath.
8:42, sir.
Good-bye, dear.
Bye.
[ Clara ]
Don't run, dear.
It's 8:45, Mr. Topper.
[ Groans ]
[ People Chattering
Indistinctly ]
Morning, Mr. Topper.
Good morning.
Good morning, Mr. Topper.
Good morning.
Good morning, Mr. Topper.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Good morning.
You know, it is a good morning too, isn't it?
I haven't enjoyed it though.
Don't you feel all right?
I don't feel all right.
I feel a million years old.
You, old?
Why, you'll never grow old,
Mr. Topper.
No?
I think you grow younger every year.
I'd rather grow younger every day. Anything special this morning?
No, but Mrs. Topper phoned me to be sure that you go to lunch promptly at 12:00.
Did she tell you what
I was to eat? It's all right, I'll remember.
The directors are all waiting in the board room.
All of them?
All except Mr. Kerby.
He promised me faithfully--
He's not here.
I phoned his penthouse and their Long Island place.
Neither of them had been home all night.
I suppose not.
We'll probably have to get a detective to... locate him the way we did last year.
If he should turn up, ask him please to come in and sign the minutes at least.
My word!
Fine place to sleep, isn't it?
Gentlemen, we will as usual conduct our annual meeting... without the presence of our largest stockholder,
Mr. Kerby.
Weather clear, track fast!
I made it!
The meeting will please come to order.
Very gratifying to have you with us, Mr. Kerby.
I will read the annual statement that is ready for publication... if approved by this board... and you, Mr. Kerby.
Okay, shoot.
Shoot, huh? "Cash on hand in federal reserve bank...
"and due from banks and bankers: $660,220,262...
"and 99 cents.
Bullion abroad and in transit:
$13,202,854 and no cents."
- No cents.
- I just said that, Mr. Kerby.
So did I.
Yes. To continue.
"Acceptances:
$47,501,324and 36 cents.
"Less own acceptances held for investments:
"$7,986,449 and 39 cents.
Which totals for
$39,514,874 and 97 cents."
Just goes to sleep from going to those wild parties.
Then you come here to sleep.
[ Continues Indistinctly ]
Just hold the car, please.
I'll be back in a couple of days.
[ People Laughing ]
[ Wolf Whistle ]
Get a load of the fur-bearing blond.
Good morning, Mrs. Kerby.
Good morning.
If you're looking for your husband--
I know where he is.
In there dummying up the directors' meeting.
But if you happen to see him looking for someone, remind him that it's me, will you?
And tell him where I am.
Oh, my goodness.
She's gone into his private office.
"Lobbies and endorsements and acceptances and foreign bills: and no cents.
"Deposits: and 39 cents.
"Liabilities and endorsements... dddd [ Humming "The Bucket"

"Balance: and 17 cents." dddd [ Continues ]
Now, if you gentlemen will agree this report is satisfactory for publication--
- It can't be done!
- I beg your pardon.
I don't understand why.
Look, try it.
You try writing your name upside down and backwards without stopping.
Here.
I move we adjourn.
I second the motion.
[ Men ]
Aye.
Carried. Now, if you gentlemen will excuse me, I have a great deal of business... that I wish to attend to at once.
Whew!
""Moss-covered bucket!"
"Write your name backwards.
It can't be done."
No sense. George Kerby's a nitwit if ever I saw one.
Confound him.
Psst!
Don't "psst" at me.
Go ahead and "psst" at him.
I think it's cute.
Why, I-I didn't know you were here.
Oh, don't apologize.
If you're confounding George,
I think you're absolutely right.
But you only have to put up with him once a year. Think of me. I have to live with him.
I like it so, but--
Please don't misunderstand.
I like George.
I-- I'm very fond of him.
And he's fond of you too.
In fact, we both are.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
No, please, no.
Uh, uh, that'll be all,
Miss Johnson.
You know, Topper, you were awfully silly not to come to our anniversary party.
It was a swell one.
Laughter for days.
In fact, I think it's-- it might be still going on.
[ Chuckles ]
I bet it was fun, yeah.
But-But Mrs.--
Mrs. Topper... doesn't approve.
She-- We had another engagement.
You understand, don't you?
Yes, I'm afraid I do.
Why don't you stop being a mummy for a few minutes and come to life?
There's nothing wrong in being a mummy if you had any fun in getting that way--
But I-- I didn't, you see.
No, I can tell that by the way you're staring at my knees.
Why, I-I never stared at a knee in my life.
That's probably just what's wrong with you.
Of course, I-- I suppose
I do envy the way you and George do things.
But it would never do for me, for a man in my position.
Then as Mrs. Topper says--
Ah, as Mrs. Topper says.
That's the situation and the box it came in.
Oh. Oh.
Hello, honey.
Never mind. I found her.
She's running the bank.
Huh?
George, look.
What's the matter with him?
He's old enough to know what's the matter with him.
"Liabilities, no cents, assets."
Topper, I know just the thing for the two of us.
Where is it?
But something's biting the man, eating him from the inside.
Maybe termites.
What sort of a woman is Mrs. Topper?
Don't tell me. I'll guess.
Is she the horsey type? No.
The tennis type? No.
I know. She's the kin type.
Arranges your diets, fixes your clothes, tells you what you'll eat and where you'll go.
Well, to a certain extent, yes.
Where do you keep it?
Keep what?
The bottle. Don't tell me there isn't a bottle here?
Of course there isn't a bottle.
This is a business office.
Business is all right, but don't you think that's carrying business too far?
Come on. Let's roll.
I don't wanna leave Topper.
Somehow I feel if I could pull him apart,
I could put him together... and he'd work much better.
[ Sighs ]
Catch.
Topper, take my advice.
Don't let her make a guinea pig out of you.
You'll never be the same again.
So long.
Hmm. Mrs. Kerby's handkerchief.
Oh. Thank you.
I'm ready, Mr. Topper.
Hmm. Yes, yes.
H. Greg & Company,
80 Milk Street,
Boston, Mass.
Dear sir. Yours is the ninth received and--
Fascinating woman,
Marion Kerby, isn't she?
She reminds me of an Easter egg
I had as a small boy.
- An Easter egg?
- Mm-hmm.
Those frosty ones, you know, with a peephole in it. You looked through and saw an angel.
I wonder why Marion Kerby reminds me of an angel.
Uh, yes, where were we?
Maybe we'd better start over.
The angel was a blond too.
You're driving us crazy way out here. I mean, you're crazy to drive us way out here.
We could be at the apartment sleeping our ears off.
The apartment's too close to that bank.
It's in the same city.
Why do you pick on the bank?
It doesn't pick on you.
That stuffed egg that runs it does.
Stuffed eggs, I love 'em.
You never know what's in 'em till you take a bite.
Take a bite out of Topper for me once and crack your teeth.
Why do you love him so?
'Cause he bores me stiff.
He's like a successful sheep.
Don't say that.
Topper has very interesting possibilities, maybe.
Well, so does a sheep.
It can be chopped or hash or soup.
[ Muttering Indistinctly ]
Hash, Topper. That fits, doesn't it, George?
Offhand, I'd say, what are you talking about?
Hash, Topper.
You know, all mixed up.
All he needs is straightening out, and I can do it.
Yes. The last time you tried straightening a guy out, you cost me ten grand.
Not this time.
The foot's down.
If you ask me, I'd say it was down too far.
I nearly skinned my eyebrows on the trees that time.
My pet, if you were driving the car, there wouldn't be any trees.
You'd have plowed 'em up.
You remember what happened to the last car we had?
Sure. You drove it into a meat market.
No, the one before that.
Well, I can't remember that far back.
George, look out.
What? There's something in my eye.
Something in your eye?
Be careful! Look out!
You'll never make it, George!
Oh, boy.
I guess I'll never hear the last of this.
Oh, look at my car.
Look at my hat.
And I got a run in my stockings.
Look at that.
I told you to slow up.
Would you? Oh, no.
Can I help it if a tire blows out? Besides, I had something in my eye.
Couldn't have been your driving, could it?
I've come around that curb much faster lots of times.
So have you.
It was such a lovely car too.
Oh, George!
Hmm?
You're getting transparent.
You're fading.
Say, that's funny.
I can see through you too.
Say, who's that?
That's us.
You know something, George?
I think we're dead.
I think you're right.
It's funny,
I don't feel any different.
No, neither do I.
Now I wonder what happens.
I don't know.
I suppose pretty soon we'll hear trumpets, and then off we go.
I hope we go together, honey.
So do I.
No trumpets.
No, no trumpets.
Marion, what do you suppose is the conventional thing to do now?
I don't know.
We've never been conventional.
I think we tell someone our good deeds, and then they open up the beautiful gates and let us through.
Yes, but what good deeds have you done?
Oh, dozens.
Name one.
Well, I've, uh--
Mm-hmm.
I've, uh--
Hey, what good deeds have you done?
Well, I--
At least we haven't done any bad ones, honey.
Yes, but that's not enough, and-- and I'm afraid it's too late now.
Yes.
And I'm afraid that for once in our, uh--
Well, for once, we're stuck.
George, maybe not.
Hmm?
Maybe if we could do a good deed now, and--
Oh, George!
You're fading.
Didn't you think the lamb was especially good?
Yes, of course it was good.
Why must we always have lamb on Sundays?
You like lamb, don't you?
Yes, I like it, but couldn't we have it on some other day?
Say Tuesday or Thursday.
We have beef on Tuesday and boiled vegetables on Thursday.
Oh, sparrows!
Why do you use that silly word?
Because you won't let me swear like a gentleman.
Cosmo, what has come over you lately?
You've been acting so strange and moody.
- Not at all like your usual self.
- I don't know.
Ever since the Kerby tragedy,
I've been thinking.
Clara, life is so very short, and we get so very little out of it.
Don't you realize, we're middle age?
But why should we be middle age?
After all, we're not so very much older than the Kerbys were.
And look how carefree they were, how full of life.
I can hardly realize they've gone.
Poor George.
Poor Marion.
Poor Marion?
Mmm.
Of course, I never saw her, but from what
I've heard of her, she never thought of anything in her whole life... except how to paint her pretty face and wag her figure about.
Oh, yes, she did.
She used to think about me.
Oh, don't be foolish.
I shudder to think what kind of a ninny you'd make if you didn't have me to stop you.
There's a man outside, sir.
He wishes to see you about a-- a contraption he's brought with him.
Oh, yes.
Well, here she is,
Mr. Topper.
[ Sighs ]
Just as good as the day she was bought.
I've got a list of the things
I've done to her.
Mm-hmm.
Now, you see here,
I put in a brand-new front axle.
No use trying to repair them things.
Well, she's something, isn't it?
How much you think we could sell it for?
Well, it's pretty hard to tell, Mr. Topper.
It ain't like trying to sell just any car.
You gotta find the right party.
You mean, someone who hasn't heard of the wreck.
Yeah, that too.
Some people are superstitious.
I mean, somebody who will fit it, kind of.
What do you mean, "fit it"?
Well, like, uh--
Well, take yourself. You could never own a car like this.
No, I suppose not.
Why couldn't I?
Well, uh, for one thing, the missus, she don't care for anything flashy, does she?
Mrs. Topper runs the household, and very efficiently too.
But when it comes to buying cars--
Of course I never wanted to buy a car like this, but... if I did want to buy a car like this, I'd, uh--
I'd buy a car like this.
[ Horn Honks ]
How do I look?
Oh, you look swell,
Mr. Topper.
[ Horn Honks ]
[ Groans ]
You bet I do.
I fit it too.
Fit it just like a kid glove, you know.
Oh, for heaven's sake,
Cosmo!
What are you doing in that horrible contrap-- that horrible thing?
Sitting in it, dear.
Just sitting.
Just sitting?
You look like a whatnot.
As a matter of fact,
I-I'm thinking of buying it.
Buying it?
Buying that-that circus wagon?
Well, of all the absurd--
Cosmo, you must be dithering.
I thought it'd be fun to drive my own car-- weekends, anyways.
Of course, I suppose you're old enough to know your own mind, but--
Clara, we used to play together once, and we could again.
We could-- We could drive up to Lake Placid, just you and I.
Stop at a roadhouse, and dinner and dance--
You're asking me to drive in a car that looks like a painted Jezebel?
And drive in it to a roadhouse?
Why, it would be like going to the opera in my nightgown.
Painted Jezebel, eh?
So I'm a ditherer.
Well, I'm jolly well gonna dither then.

Mrs. Kerby, may I present Mr. Topper.
How do you do,
Mr. Topper?
How-How-How do you do?
And this is Mr. Kerby,
Mr. Topper.
Uh, how-how do you--
George and
Marion Kerby? Why--
It can't be.
It-- It mustn't be.
It is.
Oh, dear, dear.
Topper's fainted.
Get some water, Marion.
Water.
Come on, Topper.
[ Grunts ]
Oh, that's fine.
You're a great help.
My hat!
Oh, no, no, it can't be.
It-- No, no, no--
I'm gonna get in my car and drive home.
No, Topper.
Sit down, Topper.
You can't get in your car and drive home because you've got a flat tire.
Besides, it isn't your car.
It's ours.
I'll walk. You can have the car.
Mrs. Topper doesn't like the horrible thing anyway.
George, did you hear that?
Mrs. Topper doesn't like the car.
Our good deed.
Let's get to work on him.
What do you mean?
Never mind. Why doesn't
Mrs. Topper like the car?
She just plain doesn't like it.
She often just plain doesn't like things.
What kind of talk is that?
She just plain doesn't like things.
I refuse to say another word.
I'm probably talking to myself anyway.
Well, like that.
We find you fainting all over the place.
We nurse you back to health, and still you're complaining.
I want to go home!
No, Topper, you can't go home. Besides, George has to change the tire.
And he's very good at it too.
Go ahead, honey.
All right,
I'll change the tire.
But I'll be darned if I'm gonna waste any ectoplasm doing it.
You see, Toppy, we only have a certain amount of ectoplasm to use to get visible.
Naturally, we can't waste it, can we?
Of course not, no.
No, I-- I wish someone would wake me up.
Now, now, Toppy,
I won't bite you.
Let's sit over there by the tree and be comfortable.
We might as well be comfortable while George works, don't you think so? Come on.
Come on.
You sit there and I'll relax here.
You know, Toppy, you're a funny little fellow.
You intrigue me.
Why did you happen to buy our car?
- I bought it because I was mad.
- [ Squawking ]
Who at?
- Never mind.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know.
- Toppy had a fight with Mrs. Toppy.
- I did not!
Come on. Tell the girlfriend all about it.
- What girlfriend?
- Yours. Me.
Say, you don't mind if I save my energy and just become nothing for a while, do you?
I don't suppose I do.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Dematerializing. Watch.
It works like a zipper.
Zip!
Marion!
Marion, where are you?
Right here.
What? Oh.
Well, make a noise every now and then, will you, so that I'll know where I'm talking to?
Okay, I'll do this.
[ Squawking ]
Yes, fine.
Now, go on. Tell me about buying the car.
Oh, well, I-- I just decided I'd buy it, you know.
I had an awful time with it at first, because I was going along... and then a great big truck came along and chased me off the road.
And then I was just getting over that when a huge bus came along... and-and chased me off the side of the hill like--
Hey, watch out!
Oh, I beg your pardon.
Well, then-- then I was going along... peacefully, you know, and suddenly-- bam-- I was slapped by a--
[ Chuckles, Stammering ]
Just explaining something to a friend of mine.
Is it my fault that there's no one here?

[ George ]
Hey, Marion!
Come out, come out, wherever you are.
I've got an idea.
When George has an idea, it is, generally speaking, an idea.
Bring Topper along.
We'll go places.
I don't want to go places.
I've been to places, lots of places.
Really, I have.
Oh, but not with us.
It's different when you go places with us.
Bring him along, Marion!
We gotta have him.
He's our good deed.
Come on, Toppy.
You drive, George.
I'll sit in the middle.
Come on, Topper. Get in.
Don't you think I better drive?
It'd look so crazy to other people if you drive.
[ Marion ]
Now, come on.
Don't be a mess. Get in.
[ George ]
Close your door, Topper.
[ Woman ]
Look out!
What's the matter with you?
There was no one driving that car.
Oh, you're crazy.
I'm not crazy.
I know what I saw.
The car was driving itself.
If you ask me, so was this one.
All right,
I'll prove it for you.
Well, you'll have to!
I wish you'd stop this nonsense and let yourselves be seen, or-- or let me drive.
[ George ]
Okay.
Slide over.
Now what have you got to say?
I know when I'm licked.
Where am I taking you?
[ Marion ]
You're not taking us.
We're taking you.
Marion, it's bad enough just being in the car with you two the way you are.
Well, the way you aren't.
Where are we going?
[ George ]
Unless you rented it to someone, we're going to our penthouse.
Heavens! No,
I haven't rented it.
And we can have a drink.
[ Marion ] George hasn't had a drink in days.
He looks much better than he used to, don't you think?
How in heaven's name should I know?
Hey, stop pushing.
Don't push me!
I didn't push you.
And if I did push you, what of it?
Oh, a wise guy, huh?
Like those crazy Kerbys.
[ Marion ]
Crazy Kerbys, huh?
Wise guy, eh?
I wish you'd do something about yourselves.
You have no idea how annoying it is to be out with someone and you don't know where they are.
Okay, my friend, anything to oblige.
Here we are, Topper.
The Kerby Kennel. Barking, howling and biting permissible.
Come in.
Where's Marion?
Gone to her room, I guess.
You know how women are.
When they get home, they like to change clothes, mess around, blither, blither.
You drink?
I did once, but it wasn't much fun.
Nobody noticed it.
It made me dizzy and
I had to keep one eye shut.
Oh, well, you had the floats.
I like 'em. Make you feel nice and goofy.
Maybe I do need a drink. Maybe
I've needed a drink all these years and haven't known it.
[ Cork Clangs ]
There we are. Hold it.
Topper, my pet.
Thank you.
Mmm!
My wife objects to drinking.
Then she shouldn't drink.
She doesn't.
- Then what's her objections?
- If my wife were to walk in here right now,
I'd have to speak to her very sharply in order to keep her from making a row.
Speak to her?
Yes, I've--
I've never beaten her.
Not yet, I haven't.
Oh.
Open the other bottle.
Crazy Kerbys, eh?
Plush pup!
[ Slap ]
Thanks, George.
Mm-hmm.
Do-- Do you feel like dancing?
Do I feel like what?
Oh.
You know what I mean.
Dancing and singing and--
Say that again.
Well, George, dancing, singing. dd Tra-la-la, tra-la-la
With a hey, nonny-nonny and a whoo-- dddd
Relax, Topper, relax.
Take a drink.
Stop fidgeting.
Oh.
Do you mind if I just sat here and sort of sneak a little dance... with my feet?
Cut it out.
Cut it out, will ya?
What if I just sat quietly here and-and felt like dancing?
That'd be all right, wouldn't it?
Look, what is this dancing complex?
Look here, would you mind if
I just got up and danced... a roundabout...
[ Whispering ] on my tiptoes?
[ Whispers ]
All right--
All right, if you must.
Go ahead, but take it easy. dddd [ Humming ]
Toppy, I think you got something there. Hit it.
Truck on down, Toppy.
[ Sighs ]
Now that's how I dance.
How do you like it?
Yes, I thought that was pretty bad.
I'm glad you like my dancing, George.
I think I could learn how to live after all, you know.
I can drink, all right.
And I can dance fine.
Now, about singing, hmm.
Let's sing a little, huh?
[ Marion ]
Yes, that's a good idea.
Let's sing.
Uh-huh.
Oh, there she is, George.
Where?
Topper, you look like an owl.
Come here, George.
Huh?
I'm afraid I must ask you to request your wife not to talk about me anymore.
Tsk, tsk, tsk.
Use your influence.
If you haven't any, beat her.
Come on down, Marion.
All right.
Alley!
Oop. dd Ta-rah dddd
Topper, you did that on purpose. Nice going.
I'm dreadfully sorry.
I forgive you, Topper.
Nice forgiving too.
Can we dance now?
Why, certainly. That's what
I got off my perch for. dd Oh, the moss-covered-- dd d dd Hangs in the well ddd
It's a fine thing, trying to steal my wife, eh?
Why, I wouldn't think of such a thing,
I-I don't think.
Ah, Topper,
I'm disappointed in you.
Say, if I'm in the way, you folks can leave.
Oh, not at all.
Mighty nice of you to let me stay around.
What's biting you?
You're not getting jealous, are you?
N-No. No, just getting careful.
Say, listen.
What?
All I'm trying to do is to complete our little experiment.
Yes, well, I don't know if I like it.
Well, that's too bad.
Grab a look at your little experiment now.
[ Marion Sighs ]
We're not really being very fair to him.
I don't think he knows how to drink.
But he only had a couple glasses of wine.
But I don't think he's ever had a drink in his life.
Poor Topper.
Poor Topper.
Poor Topper.
You keep out of this.
Say, George, you know something?
What?
I think fate sent him to us.
I think we ought to send him right back.
Oh, no. He looks like our last chance at a good deed.
That's how he looks to you.
Well, look at him.
His whole soul is crying out for self-expression.
Is that so?
Is that the way a soul looks when it's crying out for self-expression?
Maybe. Maybe Topper's soul.
Anyway, all he needs is a little encouragement from us.
If you really wanna do him a good deed, get him some bromo while I go change my clothes.
Hold down the fort, honey, while I dissolve into a suit.
George, where is it?
Huh? Where's what?
Where?
Where what?
The bromo, you know.
Well, then give him some.
Then he'll just have to have aspirin instead.
Oh, never mind. Let it go.
I'll be down in a minute.
Hmm, it moved.
We're fresh out of bromo.
Then put on your bonnet.
We'll go down to the drugstore and get him some.
Come on, Topper. Mm-hmm.
Dear, dear. Marion, come and hold him here while I get my hat.
All right.
Oh, George, quick!
Trying to get away, huh?
Come on, Topper.
Don't drop him or he'll splash.
Now, now, Toppy, relax, relax.
Take it easy.
[ Gasps ]
There he goes again.
Upsa-daisy, Toppy.
Say, George. We can't go down the lobby like this.
We'll cause a riot. Fade.
Okay.
Don't teeter, Topper.
For heaven's sake!
What's the matter with that man?
[ Man ]
Why-- Why--
Why doesn't he fall?
What's the idea of stealing my elevator?
[ Marion ]
We haven't got your elevator, silly.
Huh?
[ Slurred Speech ]
I never wear them.
What do you mean by insulting a guest?
Well, he was--
You're fired!
[ Marion ]
Thank you, Toppy.
I've got a beehive in my stomach, but don't mention it.
There's the bud now.
Ask him what make she is.
Yeah, she's a beaut.
So that's the babe you've been talking about.
She'd be a cinch to handle.
No gentlemen would talk about a lady like that, and I demand an apology.
You gonna... apologize?
Ah, you're daffy.
Why, you!
[ Shouting Indistinctly ]
Let's go, Marion!
[ Sirens Wailing ]
Get in.
Hey, there's the little creep now!
Get him!
What's going on here?
[ All Chattering At Once ]
One at a time.
One at a time!
Now, who hit who?
He hit us!
Oh, he hit us?
Yeah!
One man attacking the whole gang?
The other two helped him.
What other two?
Where are they?
In there.
Now don't try to be funny!
You, what happened?
That's right, Officer.
He started it, then his two friends jumped in.
What two friends?
Where are they?
They got in there.
Then the other two jumped out of the car and started slugging me from behind!
Hold on now.
Wait a minute!
Now then, what other two?
Holy cats! They're gone!
[ All Chattering At Once ]
All right, all right!
Now look, mister, maybe you can tell me what happened.
Me?
Yeah.
I wanna sing.
[ Groans ]
This one wants to sing.
All right, Danny. Come on.
Let's take 'em all in.
Sit down there.
People v. Cosmo Topper.
Say, were you guys in the same fight with him?
I'll say we were.
Who is he?
He's a big-shot banker from Wall Street.
What'd he do?
For no reason, he hangs a haymaker on Eddie's kisser.
A charge of being drunk and disorderly, attacking a peaceful citizen... and inciting a riot.
[ Marion ]
I'll tidy you up a little.
Brush him off, George, while I fix his hanky.
Okay.
There are four serious--
Just a nervous eccentricity,
Your Honor. It sometimes gets the better of me.
[ Clears Throat ]
There are four serious charges here, Mr. Topper.
I presume you wish to plead not guilty and tell your side of the story.
On the contrary, Your Honor,
I wish to plead guilty and get it over with.
Well, in that case, you leave me no alternative except to fine you $100.
-[ George ]
Why, that's outrageous!
- What's that?
I-I said, where do you pay us?
I mean, where do you pay it?
Right there. Next case.
But the dame, wow!
A dame? What did she look like? Who is she?
A burlesque queen or something.
Swell-lookin' doll, but plenty tough.
Next case.
[ All Chattering At Once ]
All right, boys, out of the way.
Is everything all right, Wilkins?
I should say, sir, though it's not my place, that everything is quite all wrong.
In fact, I might even go so far as to add that you have become a legend before your time.
Has-Has Mrs. Topper heard about last night?
Mrs. Topper, sir, has read about last night.
[ Moans ]
It's four minutes past 8:00.
I know, I know.
We dress now.
Good morning, dear.
Good morning, Cosmo.
I'm late.
Your egg, sir.
Oh.
Your toast, sir.
Well, I-- I mean, go on.
Let's get it over.
Cosmo, I've been a good wife to you.
I've helped you climb to the top in the business world... and I certainly raised you socially.
I married you for better or for worse.
And if you see fit to drag yourself and me in the gutter--
Oh, Clara, please.
Of course, you realize we'll have to face the world without any friends.
No one with any self-respect will ever cross our threshold again.
And you had to pick this particular time too.
[ Sobs ]
Well, I-- I don't understand just what you mean... about "this particular time," Marion.
I had every good reason to believe that the Stuyvesants... were going to ask us to their next big party.
The Stuyvesants.
Oh, of course.
Yes, I know you-- you wanted to be asked there for years.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Don't be sorry, Cosmo.
What's done is done.
And I will do my part... to save what little
I can from the wreck you've made of our lives.
- 8:42, sir.
- Oh. Oh, dear.
[ Door Closes ]
Yes, madam?
Is Mrs. Topper home?
Who shall I say is calling?
Mrs. Rutherford-Stuyvesant.
Mrs. Ruther--
Mrs. Rutherford-Stuyvesant? Oh.
Come in, madam.
Mrs. Rutherford-Stuyvesant calling, madam.
Mrs. Rutherford-Stuyvesant.
Mrs. Rutherford-Stuyvesant!
Oh, good gracious, Wilkins, you must be mistaken.
No, madam. Shall I--
Oh, yes, of course.
Mrs. Rutherford-Stuyvesant.
Well, so you're Mrs. Topper.
I just dropped in to ask you and that delicious husband of yours to come to dinner... next Friday night before our little dance.
Why, we-- Why, I--
Oh, I do owe you an apology.
I should have called on you years ago, but I didn't know whether you would approve of our little crowd.
Approve? Oh, my dear.
Well, you see, I understood you like to lead a quiet, simple life.
But after reading about
Mr. Topper's delightful escapade--
Mrs. Goodrich and Mrs. Simpkins.
[ Mrs. Stuyvesant ]
Well.
Hello, Grace.
I saw your car outside and thought I'd just pop in.
We've been so anxious to meet you. I'm sure we must have a great deal in common.
Thank you. I'm sure.
How do you do?
What a divine life our Mrs. Topper must live.
She must have a thrill a minute.
Living with Mr. Topper must be like dancing on dynamite.
My goodness. That's not a very good picture of him.
Well, bless my blond heart.
I never expected Mousy to break out in this kind of a heat wave.
Could, uh,
I borrow your lipstick?
Sure.
Thank you.
Oh.
Dreaming it up, huh?
Good morning, Mr. Topper.
Beautiful day, isn't it?
No. Uh, yes, I meant.
Good morning, Mr. Topper.
Good morning.
Good morning!
Good morning.
Well, good morning,
Mr. Topper.
Good morning.
What's the matter with you,
Miss Johnson?
Stop gaping at me.
I'm not a monster, in spite of the papers.
What's the matter with everybody?
Respectable bankers like J.D., who oughta frown on me, slapped me on the back and asked me if she has a friend.
I-I can't understand it.
Take a letter, please.
Mr. Wilson P. Hemmingway,
Buffalo, New York.
Dear sir,
Your collateral is satisfactory, and this corporation is prepared to finance your proposition 100%.
It will of course be necessary for you to deposit the bonds with us.
[ Gasps ]
Stop goggling, Miss Johnson.
To resume.
[ Clears Throat ]
I would suggest that you come to New York... at your earliest convenience.
[ Gasping ]
[ Scoffs ]
Really, Miss Johnson. You seem to be staring at my hat... as though you thought there was something dreadful the matter with it.
I do.
Yes, well, then I think perhaps you better take the day off... and do whatever you do do on your day off.
Perhaps I'd better had.
Yes.
All right, George, you win.
But I-- I do think you might show a little respect for the bank.
Don't push me!
Where are you?
What--
Marion wants a soda.
Oh.
So it's you, Marion.
After all the things you've done to me, you want me to buy you a soda?
Mm-hmm. A chocolate one.
Don't you understand that this is my private office?
But all I want is a chocolate soda with some vanilla ice cream in it.
Why doesn't George buy you one?
'Cause he's wandered off.
Besides, he doesn't like sodas.
And, Toppy,
I'm lonely anyway.
Haven't you any friends?
None that I like as well as you.
[ Squeals ]
Don't you do that again, ever!
Supposing George were watching us.
But he isn't.
Well, how do I know he's not?
You'll just have to take my word for it.
Now stop being difficult.
Come on.
Here's your hat and here's your stick.
Here are your gloves.
Marion wants a nice--
I know.
You want a chocolate soda with vanilla ice cream.
Mm-hmm. Do I get it?
Not for a million dollars.
Oh, so you're gonna be mean?
All right.
I can be just as stubborn as you are.
I won't budge from here.
I know what I'll do.
I'll-- I'll scream.
You wouldn't dare.
Oh, wouldn't I, though?
Help!
Stop it! I'll do anything you like, but don't do that.
All right, then.
Come on.
Shut that door.
You can't go out like that.
What will the people in the office think?
Well, supposing
I go out like this?
All right, go on.
Why, shame on you, biting little children.
[ All Chattering ]
[ Man ]
What's going on here?
Oh!
I wanna stop here.
Don't do that, Marion.
You nearly wrecked us.
I'll be out before you can say "Jack Robinson."
Only don't say it for a few minutes.
Don't talk.
Someone will hear you.
Don't look now, Toppy, but there's some lip rouge on your cheek.
Huh? Oh, yes.
This is delightful.
[ Screaming ]
[ Chattering, Shouting ]
You wait here and I'll go and investigate.
Marion, wh-what are you up to now?
Here I am, Toppy.
Oh!
Marion, you-you promised to be good, and... now look at you.
- [ Chattering Continues ]
-Don't you dare go away without me.
Why, I didn't see anything unusual, no.
Well, maybe it was the wind.
Maybe you're right.
[ Clara ]
Cosmo?
Come right in here.
For heaven's sake, what are you doing home at this time of day?
I ran away.
I-I mean, I thought it would be nice... to feel how it would be to be here during the daytime, you know.
I really can't understand these women. They--
But, really.
But women like Mrs. Stuyvesant and Mrs. Goodrich.
Never before have they--
You can forget it if you wanted to.
And if you really cared for me, there are a whole lot of things you could forget about.
Forget?
What do you mean, forget?
Yes.
Well, I know that the newspaper said awful things about me, but, you know,
I'm not that sort of a man, really.
I'm-- I'm just an old faithful dog.
That's all.
Uh-oh.
[ Gasping ]
Old faithful dog?
Cosmo, I can't stand here and let you flaunt your infidelity in my face.
But, Clara--
Don't speak.
Don't try to explain.
It's all perfectly clear.
But-But-But I bought them for you as a surprise.
A surprise?
It's a shock!
No one--
No one but a horrid woman would wear a thing like this.
[ Sobbing ]
Oh, Cosmo!
[ Door Closes ]
[ Sobbing Continues ]
Clara,
I'm so terribly sorry... about those-- about those things.
I-- Please let me in, darling, won't you?
Go away.
Go away, wicked old man.
I beg your pardon, sir, but are we packing?
I'mpacking.
Are we going away, sir?
I'mgoing away.
Can't you even look like a human being?
I don't know, sir.
I've never tried.
Well, you'd better try.
Now, sir?
Why not?
No. Better go back to the old way, I think.
Yes, sir.
And when shall I say you'll be back, sir?
Say, "I don't know."
I don't know where I'm going.
I don't know where I am.
I don't know anything.
Say anything that pops into your fat, stupid head.
And lo, the worm turns.
Ah, well.
I thought perhaps a cup of tea would help.
That's very kind of you.
I don't want any tea, Wilkins.
And I won't be down for dinner.
I-I couldn't bear the thought of facing him.
That won't be necessary, madam.
Mr. Topper has gone.
Gone? Gone where?
He didn't know.
He didn't know?
But that's ridiculous.
Nobody can go away and not know where they've gone.
Nobody can.
Wilkins, after all these years, are you trying to be funny?
No, madam.
Mr. Topper went with a suitcase... in the contraption.
[ Sobbing ]
He's left me.
I'll never see him again.
Oh, no, madam.
He'll come back.
If you'll pardon the liberty, madam, he'll come back... just to find out whether you've missed him or not whilst he was away.
They always do.
Of course I'll miss him.
But he mustn't know that, madam.
What difference does it make?
Even if he does come back,
I can never hope to hold him.
That woman-- He--
He doesn't want me anymore.
He-- He wants these.
Did you say he wanted those, madam?
Yes, I-I did.
Then why not let him have them?
I don't--
I don't mean just these things.
I mean--
Oh, Wilkins.
He's mad about the sort of creature who-- the sort of woman who wears these things.
But, my dear, dear madam, might I suggest that... you could so easily be the alluring sort of woman who wears those?
Oh, confound it, madam.
I still say if he wants the pants, let him have them.
Oh! Wilkins!
How dare you--
Wilk--
[ Muttering ]
Have a bite, Toppy.
Marion!
That's for running away from me.
I'm mad at you.
Well, why don't you go away?
Leave me alone.
Oh, I'm not that mad.
But I ask you, do you think it was very nice... to run away from me?
Oh, don't let's talk about it anymore.
I've had enough of it.
I've had enough of everything.
Oh, Toppy, don't be mad at me.
Where are we going?
I don't know.
I've left home.
Doesn't matter where I go.
Oh!
Then I'll tell you what let's do.
Let's go to the Sea Breeze Hotel.
It's right on this road.
Is it?
Mm-hmm.
We can swim and play and dance every night.
There's a wonderful orchestra there.
Oh, it'll be fun.
Swim and play and dance every night, eh?
I bet it would--
What am I talking about?
I'm a married man.
I can't go gallivanting off with a--
Oh, Toppy, you'll be fine.
Well, we won't go.
Look here, Marion, if you're here
I'm gonna be very angry.
In fact, I am angry now.
I won't have you upsetting me all the time.
Of course I'm here.
You didn't suppose I'd leave my Toppy, did you?
Be careful.
Here comes the bellboy.
Take this bag, will you?
Why are you staring at me like-like-- like something?
I don't know.
Aren't you the guy that cost me my last job?
Never saw you before in my life.
Hey, did you notice something funny about that guy?
That guy ain't funny.
He ain't even human.
Then I'll take charge of this.
[ Man ]
Call for Miss White, please.
Calling Miss White.
How do you do?
We have a nice room on the third floor.
Third floor.
That'll do very nicely, thank you. Any floor.
Take this gentleman to 314.
Yes, sir.
This way.
Did you see what I saw?
Did I see what, Sherlock?
Nothin'.
Are you always this anxious at getting a hotel room?
I have a reason for being anxious to get into this room in a hurry.
Well, I have a reason to get out of this room in a hurry.
Come on.
Let me out.
Go on.
Here.
Wait a minute.
Here. Here.
Go on. Get out.
I wanna shut the door.
What's wrong with you?
Between you and that guy in 314, you'll excuse me if I go nuts.
[ Water Running ]
Marion. Marion, oh,
I do hope it isn't you.
What did you say?
I can't hear with this water running.
I said come out from under my shower!
No use.
I can't understand a word you're saying.
Stop it, Marion.
We're being watched.
I wish you'd fly out a window and leave me alone.
Oh, Marion, confound it.
Use your common sense.
I've already used my common sense.
I've ordered cocktails.
And you'd better jump in the shower and get yourself pretty.
I wouldn't change my tie with you in the room.
Oh, Toppy, don't worry about me.
Get into your dinner clothes.
You're not dressed, are you?
Yes, I am dressed.
Well, get so that I can see you, so that I can keep track of you.
How's this?
You didn't have this on under the shower, did you?
No. But I just decided to be dressed, and here I am.
Now you get dressed, and hurry up.
All right.
You sit here where I can see you.
And what am I supposed to do, twiddle my thumbs?
Mr. Topper home?
Mr. Topper's not at home, sir.
Are you sure?
Am I sure?
Why, certainly, I'm sure, sir.
Why shouldn't I be sure?
I just wondered.
You look to me like the kind of fellow who might not be sure.
Mr. Topper is not at home, sir.
That's what I said.
Wilkins, what is the matter?
Oh.
Mrs. Topper?
Mrs. Topper, where's that mouse of a husband of yours?
Mouse?
Shall I eject this person, madam?
Yes.
Well, no.
Uh, listen, smiley, you stay out of this.
Mrs. Topper, I'm looking for that goofy husband of yours.
I beg your pardon, sir, but I must ask you to be a little more careful... with your language in front of Mrs. Topper.
Otherwise, I shall put the slug on you.
No, no.
Don't be athletic.
Where's your husband?
Where's your husband,
Mrs. Topper?
I don't know.
Mr. Topper's gone away.
Yes, well, that's just what I thought.
What do you mean?
Mrs. Topper,
I'm looking for my wife, and I've got a certain sneaking suspicion that if I find Topper,
I'm gonna find her too!
You mean she might be with Cosmo?
Yes, well, it's just possible.
Listen, have you got a slug of scotch?
'Cause I've got the jitters.
I'm sorry, but we've never had any stimulants in the house.
That's a fine thing.
Why don't you have a snort in the house for the poor man, instead of lamb on Sunday, stew on Monday, beef on Wednesday?
Why don't you go out dancing with him occasionally?
Then he wouldn't have left you.
I suppose you're right.
Well, it's too late now.
Oh, dear.
Please go, sir.
You're breaking the madam's heart.
Yeah. Well, if I find Topper,
I'll break his neck.
And believe me,
I'll find him!
Oh!
He's very handsome, isn't he?
[ Sobbing ]
Mrs. Topper!
Get me an aspirin.
Why, of course.
Wilkins, I'm not supposed to be the butler.
You are.
So I am.
I'll get the aspirin myself.
[ Marion ]
Come in.
Marion, get out of here.
Quick. Someone's coming.
That's right.
[ Cosmo ]
Come in.
What are you gaping at?
C-Can I hear you say
"Come in" again?
Don't be impertinent.
Put those things down there.
Well, hurry up.
Hurry up.
Oh, get out!
Can't you look where I'm going?
Yes, sir.
[ Stammering ]
So what's eatin' you?
The next time I go to 314,
I'm not going.
Yeah, the guy's spooky.
I just brought him four cocktails.
Four cocktails at one time?
For one guy?
Well, one guy and two voices.
What do you mean, two voices?
Well, first he goes way down low like this.
Then he talks way up high like a dame.
Talks way up--
Talks way up high like a dame?
Well, get downstairs and get the manager.
Get him up here right away.
He don't need a manager.
He needs a straitjacket.
Hurry up.
Well?
Don't scare me like that.
You know
I'm a bundle of nerves when I'm on duty.
You sent for me, Casey.
Yes, and I'm glad you finally got here.
Why? What's wrong?
Hey, you see, the guy--
Quiet.
I'm in charge here.
Don't you understand?
He's got a woman in there, and she's not registered.
I'll attend to this.
[ Clears Throat ]
- Shh! Who is it?
- I'm the hotel manager.
Please open this door at once.
Vanish.
Shh.
I'm sorry, sir, but I shall have to ask you... and, uh, the lady to give up your room.
The lady?
What lady?
What lady?
Perhaps you can explain the red on this cigarette.
Yes. I cut my tongue when I was shaving this morning.
Hmm. Cut your tongue?
Mm-hmm.
Listen, don't try to kid us.
There's a woman in here.
We heard her.
Mm-hmm.
She's gone.
Casey, you're a fool.
I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Topper, to have caused you this embarrassment.
I-- I hope you'll accept my apology.
Oh, but think nothing of it.
Promise me you'll think nothing of it.
You have no idea how badly I should feel if you didn't promise me... you were going to think nothing of it.
Well, I am sorry. I--
I hope you'll accept my humble apology.
Why, it's a deal.
I guess I'm sorry too.
Cuckoo!
Uh, m-me too.
Get out of here, you moron.
House detective, eh?
[ Door Slams Shut ]
A fine hash you've made of things.
[ Topper, Marion Laughing ]
Now don't tell me that you hear two people laughing.
Another mistake like this and you'll be fired.
Now, watch yourself.
Come on, Toppy.
I'm hungry.
Let's go down to dinner.
On an empty stomach?
I want some more pink ladies.
I'll get you some more pink ladies. Come on.
It's a good thing no one saw us coming out of my room.
Why, Toppy,
I think we look lovely.
We're the best dressed couple in this hallway.
Well, let's-- let's pretend we're not together.
[ Elevator Doors Open ]
[ Whistling ] dddd [ Orchestra ]
Thank you, Toppy.
Mm-hmm.
You know, Marion, you're positively beautiful.
[ Chuckles ]
Yes, I might almost say you were gorgeous.
Mmm.
I will say it.
You are gorgeous.
I think you're gorgeous too, darling.
Oh, captain, bring the wine list.
We don't want a wine list.
No?
We want a flock more of pink ladies.
That's right.
Bring a lot of pink ladies.
And go on bringing them, on and on.
Yes, sir.
Yeah! dd Old Man Moon

Yeah! dd Go spread the news dd dd To all the stars above dd dd Shine for my baby while we're dancin' tonight dd dddd [ Continues ]
I wanna dance.
I thought we wanted to drink.
Mm-hmm.
I do. I wanna drink,
I wanna dance, I wanna sing.
I wanna--
I wanna have fun.
Whee!
Whoo-hoo! Come on!
Let's dance. dd And if it's possible dd dd Keep shinin' till noon dd dd My sincerest thanks to you, sir dd dd Old Man Moon dd dddd [ Continues Indistinctly ]
My, this is fun.
Well, I'm glad one of us is enjoying it.
Oh, I say, huh?
Oh, no. Don't listen to me.
I really like it a lot.
And I like you a lot.
Toppy, are you falling in love with me?
I tell you, I'm just that way about you.
Just that way about my wife, huh?
Listen, Marion, what did you mean by that remark on the telephone?
"We're not married anymore."
Come here.
I want to talk to you.
Hey, listen, what are you so burned up about?
What about you up in Westchester?
Don't change the subject.
What did you mean by that remark?
You'll pardon us, but this is just an old family after-dinner custom.
Now, listen, Marion--
Oh, George, you're ruining our good evening.
Here. Have a pink lady.
Oh, I've had a pink lady.
And to places with a good deed.
I'd rather have you.
[ Toppy ] Of course, of course.
You stay out of this.
Never mind, Toppy.
I'll meet you in the lobby.
What's wrong here?
You are.
Take a walk.
You can't talk that way to me.
Shut up!
She's right.
That's enough out of you.
See here, young la--
Where did she go to?
Never mind.
You stay here like a good little pelican, and I'll find her.
Hey, where are you?
Where'd you go to?
Where are ya, either one of ya?
[ Chattering, Shouting ]
[ Gasps ]
Why don't you watch what you're doing!
I didn't do anything.
Well, then watch yourself.
Well, I've got enough to worry about.
What happened? I--
Stop pushing me!
I'll not stop pushing you because I didn't push you!
Ohh!
Topper, you're going home to your wife where you belong.
George, I won't be ordered about.
You're going home!
I am not.
Oh, yes, you are.
[ Giggling ]
Oh, you naughty boy, to tickle me like that.
What?
[ Loud Slap ]
Well, my husband will put a stop to this.
I wish he would, really.
Where are you going?
I quit.
That guy from 314 is too much for me.
Don't be silly. I'll have this rumpus straightened out before I can bat an eye.
You just stand here and bat your eyes.
I'm going out and get a nice quiet job in a nut factory.
[ George ]
Sit down, Topper.
I wanna talk to you.
I won't sit down!
Oh, yes, you will.
No, I will not.
[ Chuckles ]
Something a little odd about this hotel, don't you think?
I'm having a little chair trouble, but you pay no attention to it.
I'm, uh-- I'm reading.
Where's Casey?
I don't know. He wouldn't be any help anyway.
Well, you go call the police before the whole hotel's wrecked.
George. George, this can't go on.
It's gotta stop.
George.
I beg your pardon.
Did you drop this?
Oh!
Why, you-- you witch, you!
Casey, get that wild man to my office before we lose every guest in the house.
Right. I'll show him who he thinks we are.
The manager wants to see you instantaneously.
I don't wanna see him.
Now, don't evade the question.
You're gonna see him anyhow.
George? George.
George!
Uh-huh.
I've been looking for you.
What do you say we make up?
Okay, hon.
Hey, you know, this is the best fight we ever had.
But look at poor Toppy.
We've gotta do something about him.
It's practically done.
Get his bag in the car.
All right, darling.
[ Gasps ]
Oh!
What are you doing?
Stop it!
You're hurting Rollo!
Take this sack of bones off of me!
Won't somebody help me, please?
So you're the guy that caused all this trouble, huh?
I'm the house detective.
I'm in charge here.
Come on. Get up.
Here, hold this while
I go for the cuffs.
Eh, what is this?
It's a dog.
Are you trying to make a sap out of me?
[ George ] It's too late.
Who said that?
Did you say that?
Of course not.
That's what's wrong here.
There's a phantom something or someone who's wrecking this hotel.
And I want him caught!
A phantom?
[ Scoffs ]
Who you trying to kid?
[ Woman Screaming ]
All right, men, surround it!
Surround who?
Who's giving orders here?
You folks watch the door.
Come on, men. Follow me.
All right, men, line up.
We'll rake the room.
Quiet!
[ Chattering Stops ]
Ooh-ga-boo!
Steady, men.
We're closing in on him.
Bread and butter.
[ George ]
Ba-boom! Happy New Year!
[ Lightbulb Explodes ]
There he is!
Ooh! Get off!
Up. Get up!
A fine bunch of cops you are.
I had that guy right where he wanted me, till you crossed him up.
He's gone!
He's gone!
Sergeant, he's gone.
He got into the automobile and drove away, but nobody was driving it.
Oh, there must be an easier way to make a livin' than this.
[ Marion ]
Stop squirming, Topper.
What's the matter with you?
I can't help it.
Look at that speedometer.
What are you two trying to do, make me like you?
[ George ]
Can't help it, old boy.
I'm scared stiff!
Where are we going?
[ George ]
I'm sorry, Topper.
I don't know.
All I know is
I've gotta go there, fast!
Slow down!
Please slow down!
[ Crash ]
I said you'd ruin me, and you have.
Now you've done it.
George, Marion, where are you? Oh.
A fine thing.
Here we are again.
Hmph. Once more around that curve,
I won't have a hat left.
Look at Topper.
Hmm?
Now look here, you two.
But look at me.
I'm just like you now.
Keep your garters on,
Toppy.
You'll be all right.
You're just a little unconscious.
Ah, yeah. You're much too solid, Topper.
I don't think you've become a member of our club yet.
Well, I won't go back.
I won't do it.
Why not?
You won't do what?
I won't go back to that silly old routine.
Up at 8:00, bed at 11:00.
Lamb on Sundays.
I won't do it!
Oh, Topper, don't be foolish.
They won't make you do that again.
I'd rather stay here with you and Marion, even though it is like living on the top of a volcano.
But, Topper, you've gotta go back. You don't know how much it means to her.
No, I won't.
Topper, you've gotta go back!
Don't you see--
George! Trumpets!
[ Siren Wailing ]
No, no, it isn't trumpets.
It's an ambulance!
Get back, Topper!
No, I don't wanna go.
Well, if I've got to go,
I've got to go.
But I'll get up when
I feel like it in the morning and I'll have some fun.
Where were we?
You've had an accident, but you're safe at home and you're going to be all right.
[ Grunts ]
Where's-Where's Marion?
I'll call Mrs. Topper right away.
No, not Mrs. Topper.
Marion.
Who's Marion?
Oh. Mm-hmm.
She's probably someone
I dreamed about when I was in the ether.
But you didn't have any ether.
Oh, yes, I did.
You'd be surprised.
Your wife is very anxious to see you. Do you feel able to talk to her?
[ Groans ]
You would bring that up.
I'm all right.
Go ahead and call her.
Might as well get it over with.
[ Knocking ]
Mr. Topper is conscious and wishes to see you.
- Is he really all right?
- He's perfectly fine.
Oh!
Madam?
[ No Audible Dialogue ]
Why, Wilkins!
Mmm. dd dd The old oaken bucket dd The iron-bound bucket dd dd The moss-covered bucket that hangs-- dddd
See? Since I quit drinking, no more jitters.
Well, I wish you'd sit down.
You give me the jitters.
What in the world are you trying to do anyway?
Shh!
Quiet. I'm practicing to be an angel.
Some angel you'll make.
Hmm!
Nice retorting.
Well, I'm still your little angel, aren't I, honey?
Oh, stop it.
Well, aren't I?
Of course you are.
But don't say "Aren't I."
Okay, pet.
Ain't I?
Say, I do hope Mrs. Topper doesn't gum up our good deed.
Well, we'll know in a minute.
Oh, darling.
I was so afraid
I was going to lose you.
Oh, you can't lose a bad penny like me, you know.
You're not a bad penny.
You're just the dearest, sweetest husband... a woman ever had.
Darling, you amaze me.
You look so differently, and you-- you act so differently.
I am different.
And I've been praying you'd come back, so I could prove it.
Will you promise not to laugh if I show you something?
I promise.
I'm-I'm too astonished to laugh.
You do understand, don't you?
Oh, darling, I understand.
Why... I love you.
Cosmo.
But I wonder if you knew everything.
If you knew--
I don't want to know anything.
I'm just going to love you, and never question.
So long, Toppy.
We're on our way.
We won't be seeing you anymore, Toppy.
So long.
What was that?
I thought I heard voices.
No. Remember, darling, love me and never question.
Bless our happy home.
A whale! A whale!
Now you all keep quiet, and I'll tell you about the time
Uncle Mickey was shipwrecked.
'Twas a dark and stormy night.
The lightning flashed.
The thunder rolled.
The wind whistled.
And the wind howled.
It was a terrible storm.
And then a big wave picked me up and rolled me up on the beach.
I was in a strange land.
Boy, was I tired.
I slept all night, under a blanket of beautiful stars.
And then day broke.
Fire!
Well Mr Standish, we've made good travelling.
Delightful .. today it is my turn, Clinton.
Here.
Oh lookee gentlemen, Captain Standish pays with our good English gold.
He knows his Yankee script has no currency here.
Gentlemen .. I give you the King.
The King!
Well, I owe no allegiance to George III.
However, since the war has been over a year .. your King.
Well put, sir.
Now I'll give you another toast, more to your liking.
Your General Washington.
Washington!
You best beware our English ales,
Standish .. it is a strong brew.
Look Clinton, I'll bet you five guineas
I'll drink you under the table in town.
Taken!
Now there Landlord, what's the talk of London?
Nowt .. excepting last Friday, a
Frenchman flew over the Channel.
Dover to Calais.
- Flew?
Hey, where's my Yankee friend? Hi .. Standish.
It is the very thing you bored me with all the way from America.
The day would come he said, when we would all fly.
Aye, and we laughed him down.
- By what means did the Frenchman fly?
Why, he flew in a basket sir, hung under a big bag of hot air.
A "balloon" I think they call it, sir.
It's beginning .. this new age of speed and invention.
Which we shall never live to see.
Will you take your places gentlemen, please.
What time shall we reach London, Major?
- Mid-afternoon, if you bestir yourself.
Then I shall be able to wait upon my cousins .. before dinner.
Where do they reside?
Berkeley Square.
Wilkins.
Oh, master Tom.
Gad's life, Wilkins.
When did you turn prude?
Tell me, why do you slink about so?
Are not maids difficult enough to find at the beggarly wage we can afford?
Without your making the keeping of them impossible.
It is me you should thank sister, that they seek our employment at all.
Your tastes are those of a stable-boy.
- You're all alike in the dark.
Children, he's arrived! Our cousin
Peter Standish is in London.
A letter from him.
- Oh read it, Ma.
Having arrived within the hour,
I shall do myself the honour ..
To wait upon you at half past five o'clock in Berkeley Square.
Ten minutes! Ha, the
Yankee wastes no time.
Now Tom, you will meet him below and bring him up here.
And Kate .. you will welcome him, on my behalf.
Not alone? Surely, you will present him to me?
You will do as I tell you.
Would you have me sell myself to pay our debts?
Oh dear me, the baggage grows bashful.
Now lookee Kate ..
Hook this Yankee Standish, and there's no more talk of beggary in this family.
I know what you have in mind.
You think to find him drink, women and cards so that he'll pay for yours.
Will you bag it!
Thomas ..
Ma'am ..
He commends your miniature.
Such blushes too .. art or nature Kate?
More natural than wit in you.
Your husband will find you sharp of tongue, my lass.
If only he'll have you.
Five o'clock.
Herbert's life! Why, the suitor of my younger sister is below!
Throstle? Oh, a disgusting little man.
Hush Kate.
As you well know, Mr Throstle is to enter in our family.
But what of Helen's feelings, Ma'am?
You may trust me to act in her interest.
- Oh, what's wrong with him, Kate?
Teeth none too good perhaps.
But a man of parts and ..
Fifteen hundred a year.
- Thomas!
Ma'am ..
Mr Throstle my Lady.
Your servant Lady Ann.
- Dear Mr Throstle.
Miss Pettigrew .. your servant sir.
We have great news.
- I am aware of it.
I met but now, Major Clinton who travelled from America with your cousin.
Indeed Mr Throstle, very little happens in London that you don't hear of.
And Miss Helen?
You will find her in the music room .. dear Mr Throstle.
And you Tom .. when our cousin arrives you are not to say "colonial".
The colonists are now independent.
- "Yankee puppy" then ..
And you are NOT to mention the late war with America.
Oh, you don't know those Yankees.
It won't be I who will mention it.
- You will ruin everything ..
Kate!
At your service, dear Miss Helen.
- I am your servant, sir.
You are aware Miss Helen, that I have your mother's permission to pay my ..
Mr Throstle .. I am most sensible of the honour that you would do me.
But I shall never marry.
At least Miss Helen ..
Since your affections are not disposed elsewhere, my hopes ..
I shall never marry.
Helen .. our cousin Peter
Standish is in London.
And is about to present himself.
Mr Throstle, our cousin has decided he will buy a town-house, a country estate.
And a wife!
Thomas!
I hear a coach.
Yes .. it is a coach.
Tom .. downstairs to him.
- Good luck with your savage, Kate.
Come, dear Mr Throstle .. come Helen.
Why must mother make it so hard?
- I know. But only be yourself, Kate.
Our cousin will not eat you.
Where's your Yankee? I thought he must have let himself in.
Wilkins said there was no knock.
- He did not hear it for the rain.
He's on the doorstep.
- No, he's not. I looked myself.
Well someone must let him in.
Well, of course. He's gone around to the servant's door. Knows his place.
Good afternoon Miss Frant.
- Good afternoon Mrs Barwick.
Is Mr Standish in? Or rather, is he ever out?
Mr Standish was very particular. He was not to be disturbed Miss Frant.
I suppose you are aware that
Mr Standish and I are to be married?
Oh yes Miss .. I'm sure I didn't mean to offend you.
Oh that's alright Mrs Barwick.
It's only that I'm so worried about him.
Cooped up in this house for three days.
He's a gentleman of moods, Miss.
Well, he wasn't until he inherited this house and came to England.
Tell me, what does he do with himself here?
Well .. he reads a great deal.
It seems he found some old books and papers in the house.
And then .. he walks about.
Frequently, I'm hearing him in the night, Miss.
He was here, Miss.
Just a few minutes ago.
I'll see ..
- Mrs Barwick ..
This house has some queer hold on Mr Standish .. it isn't healthy.
Yes Miss.
Peter.
Oh, hello Marjorie.
Why a candle?
They used them, you know.
What's that?
Oh this? It's the Crux Ansata.
The Egyptian symbol of eternal life, I believe.
It came with the house.
You know .. I've made some wonderful finds since seeing you.
Look .. Peter Standish's diary.
His trip from New York took twenty-seven days.
The war was just over. He fought under Washington you know.
Look here .. he says here that
Reynolds wouldn't finish his portrait.
But he did finish it.
It's obviously all Reynolds.
You might have sat for it yourself.
And his name was Peter Standish too.
It's very odd.
Yes, it is strange, isn't it.
Look. He married the eldest sister Kate
Pettigrew. They lived in this house.
I've got other papers about them.
They had children who died here.
Then there was a younger sister, Helen.
Her people tried to force her into a marriage that she hated.
Look here, there's even something about a shawl.
A cashmere shawl that Helen's aunt gave her, just before Peter came over.
You see .. minute details about everything.
And I've got all his letters too, courting Kate before he'd ever seen her.
They were hidden in this box here.
Here's the letter that Peter wrote
Lady Ann, the girl's mother.
Just after he arrived.
Imagine Marjorie .. that clock.
Ticked away for five generations.
Maybe it's ticking away now.
Back in that other time.
Other time?
Four o'clock.
He comes at half past five,
September the 3rd.
Sept ..? Why, that is today.
The paper is yellow, the ink is faded.
And I imagine Lady Ann is reading this letter ..
Now.
It's 149 years ago today.
Half past five, September the 3rd 1784.
That he walked in.
Through that door.
Peter. Do you realize you haven't seen me for three days?
You haven't even called me up.
Old Mr Pettigrew wouldn't have a phone in the house.
He left everything just as it was.
Furniture.
Everything.
I believe you care more about this old house, than you do about me.
You're so nervous, dear.
You're smoking too much.
Am I?
Oh well .. it's only a month until I'll be living here.
And able to look after you.
Listen, Marjorie.
I must have that month here ..
Alone.
- Alone?
Marjorie .. please trust me.
Oh I will trust you .. if you will only tell me what this is all about.
You would not ..
No, I can't ..
You mustn't ask me that.
What's that?
What?
It sounded like a wagon .. or a coach rattling over cobblestones.
It seemed to stop here.
There is only your car at the door.
Peter .. a coach .. cobblestones?
In Berkeley Square?
Yes .. silly, wasn't it.
Well Peter .. it's time to come along to tea.
Tea?
Oh yes of course .. the Ambassador.
I've got to be back at half past five.
- Is someone coming?
No ..
Well then, come along dear.
It will do you good.
You know, Marjorie.
You don't want to marry me.
You only want to look after me.
One goes with the other.
- I suppose so.
It won't take me a moment to get a coat. I'll be back in a jiffy.
How quickly we Americans take to tea over here.
Yes, it doesn't take long to get to like tea, does it.
I don't mean the tea itself, but what it stands for.
A sort of charming rest period, all that sort of thing.
Is that a portrait of John Adams, sir?
- Yes.
Our first minister to Great Britain.
He came over here in 1784.
It's after five. I must run along.
- Oh, but you don't have to go, Peter.
Well ..
- Goodbye dear.
Marjorie.
The next time you see me ..
If I behave oddly or ..
It's no use.
Goodbye, dear.
We must get him out of that house.
Don't worry.
Thank you. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Changeable weather we're having.
- Has it been changeable?
I hardly realized there has been any weather.
Haven't been going out much, eh?
- No, I ..
Why do you ask?
- Oh, nothing in particular.
I just wondered why I hadn't seen you anywhere all these weeks.
Well .. that house has been taking up most of my time.
You know, I've been wondering why that remote English cousin left it to you.
Old Mr Pettigrew?
When he read a paper of mine on architecture.
It turned out later that a Standish ancestor of mine had built the place.
Oh, I see.
You know.
People sometimes get morbid and musty when they ..
They shut themselves up in old houses.
Marjorie is really quite disturbed about you.
I do wish she wouldn't be.
I really can't go out just now.
Look here, Standish.
Don't you think you ought to get away for a while?
Get away?
Yes, it would be great to get away, wouldn't it.
Really away, into the blue.
You think I'm a bookworm, don't you?
But there still are adventures.
Inconceivable adventures.
Why shouldn't I tell you?
I want to leave someone here who knows.
Knows? Knows what?
I believe when I go back to my house in
Berkeley Square at five-thirty tonight.
I shall walk into the 18th Century.
And meet the people living there.
Well.
Now that I've told you I suppose you will, ring up a specialist.
Well.
Of course, none of us believe in ghosts in America, but ..
Over here, in these old houses ..
Who said anything about ghosts?
I believe they are alive.
Peter Standish is alive.
Just as I'm living here, he is living there.
Back in his own time.
Own time?
You mean ..
He's still alive in the 18th Century?
Yes.
But, it's impossible ..
- No, no. Look here.
I know what you're going to say.
Perhaps this will help to clear it up.
Suppose you are in a boat.
Sailing down a winding stream.
You watch the banks as they pass you.
You went by a grove of maple trees upstream.
But you can't see them now, so you saw them .. in the past, didn't you?
Now you watch a field of clover, before your eyes, this moment. In the present.
But you don't know what is waiting for you round the bend in the stream ahead.
There may be wonderful things, but you can't see them until you round the bend.
In the future.
Can you?
- No.
Alright then. Now, remember, you're in the boat.
And I'm up in the sky above you in a plane. I'm looking down on it all.
I can see it all at once.
So that the past, the present and the future .. the man in the boat.
Are all one.
To the man in the plane.
Why, doesn't that prove that all time must really be one?
Time .. real time.
Is nothing but an idea.
In the mind of God.
Well that ..
That seems a sound argument.
- Argument?
How would you like to walk the quiet streets of London in the 18th Century?
And breathe pure air instead of the fumes of gasoline.
Ride in sedan chairs instead of taxi-cabs.
Meet John Adams.
Why .. you wouldn't like it when you got there.
You'd make mistakes, they'd find out.
Oh no they wouldn't.
Here .. here's my passport.
- What's that?
His diary .. Peter Standish's diary.
I know everything he did from the moment he arrived in Berkeley Square.
Of course, naturally I'd have to do everything that he did.
I mean, I couldn't change anything in the 18th Century ..
That really had happened in the 18th Century. Could I?
I'm late .. I must be back by 5:30.
Thanks very much.
- Standish, don't ..
Good day, sir.
I am your servant, sir.
At your service, cousin.
Who?
Who are you?
- Kate Pettigrew.
Kate.
Pettigrew.
On my mother's behalf,
I bid you welcome, sir.
Your mother?
Oh yes, the Lady Ann.
I trust she is well.
- I thank you, sir.
It's uh .. it's raining awfully hard.
Oh yes, you will find the weather wretched in London.
You uh .. seem a little constrained, cousin.
Well you are not exactly at your ease yourself.
Had you a tiring journey?
You said nothing of your voyage in your letter.
My letter?
To my mother, from The Blue Boar.
The Blue Boar?
Oh yes of course, I went there when the coach came in and I ..
I had just come over from America.
Well, we did not think you'd come from Poland.
In the General Wolfe.
It took 27 dreary days.
Really? In the packet?
Did you not swim across?
Forgive me cousin, for being a bore.
But your manners have been unexceptionable, sir.
But hardly appropriate for one who has met his betrothed ..
For the first time.
- Are we betrothed?
I'd not heard of it.
- Come, Kate.
It was practically all arranged in our letters.
But sir!
- Kate.
Sir!
Kate.
This is more in keeping with what I've heard of your rough ways at home, sir.
I vow you are the audacious fellow
I told Helen we must expect.
Helen?
Oh yes. Yes, your sister.
You have not even asked my mother's permission to pay your addresses.
Oh, must I do that?
- Well, is it not invariably done?
Well uh .. not in New York.
This is London.
And do visitors in New York walk into houses without so much as by-your-leave?
Well, I pressed the bell.
Bell?
I mean I .. I knocked.
Oh.
We saw you alight from your coach. But who let you in?
The door was ajar .. I walked in.
Simply to get out of the rain.
But your clothes are dry.
I wore a cloak.
My miniature.
Fair.
What is that?
It's for you.
Oh.
Most charming, but ..
But is this not a little premature?
Premature?
Well, does this not signify in
New York .. what it does here?
Of course, if you will have the declaration formal.
I know how it was done.
Uh how it .. is done.
Miss Pettigrew, fair cousin.
Will you be my wife?
You go much too fast.
- You'll not dislike me for that.
I've not said that I dislike you.
Well, I cannot find ..
Ye gads ..
My brother Tom .. Mr Peter Standish.
Your servant, sir.
I trust you had a pleasant journey, sir?
Yes .. yes indeed.
Thank you.
We have been searching everywhere for you, sir.
Ma'am, I present our cousin,
Mr Peter Standish.
Oh welcome. Ten thousand welcomes dear, dear cousin.
And may I present our dear friend, Mr Throstle.
Mr Standish.
- Your servant, sir.
And Helen .. I present our cousin, Mr Peter Standish.
I am your servant, sir.
Your servant, cousin.
If London interests you sir, I shall be glad to show you the town.
Oh yes, yes.
Where should I take him first?
Cox's museum, Ranelagh or Vauxhall?
Of course, I shall put you down for Brookes' club.
Thanks, I want to see everything.
Should your tastes prove more sober than Mr Tom's, sir ..
I shall be glad to present you to the
President of the Royal Academy.
Sir Joshua.
Reynolds?
Do you think he'd paint my portrait?
- Aye, at a hundred guineas.
Five hundred dollars.
For Reynolds.
Indeed it is a monstrous price, but he's the fashion.
Of course my prospective brother-in-law may persuade him to paint you for less.
Brother-in-law?
Our cousin will be here for your birthday reception, Helen.
Oh, then your aunt's gift is your birthday present?
Gift?
I mean the cashmere shawl.
Oh Helen, you sly puss.
Is it a shawl?
Aunt Willoughby gave me a parcel for my birthday.
But I wasn't to open it until then.
I haven't opened it.
I don't know what's in it.
Dear me, what conjurer's trick is this?
How did you know about Helen's present?
Yes, how did you know it was a shawl?
I believe it is an American jest.
A shawl .. so it is, by gad.
But cousin, how did you know?
Indeed, how cousin? Come, come sir.
I'm heartily sorry. I must have got muddled somehow.
Muddled sir? Muddled? It is not you who are muddled.
Oh Helen, here is a rival for you.
Now lookee cousin. Can you read thoughts like my sister?
No, of course not.
Pray solve us your riddle, Peter.
I .. I must have heard about the shawl somewhere.
But sir, you just now reached
London from America.
I'm afraid our cousin Peter is not well.
No, I'm not .. I have a rather tiresome headache.
And then you must rest until dinner.
Tom .. take our cousin to his room.
Ma'am .. come along.
Hmm .. the man must be gifted with second-sight.
Such feats as this are common in Scotland.
Your room, cousin.
Thank you sir.
Now that the rain has ceased, I shall go to The Blue Boar for your boxes.
Berkeley Square.
I thought it would look like this.
Why do you stop?
I hope your headache is gone, cousin.
There wasn't really anything the matter with your head, was there?
No, not really.
But you were the only one who saw.
But any rate, you made them stop bothering me.
And ..
How could you know about my shawl?
Please .. don't ask me any more about the confounded thing.
If you wish.
Thank you.
You know .. just as soon as I saw you I felt ..
Here is someone I can talk to.
You'll help me out here, won't you?
How can I help you, cousin?
It's all so strange.
- Strange?
Yes, all this.
England? London?
Yes.
I didn't think it would but it makes me .. uncomfortable.
You see that. I see that you see it.
I feel like a fish out of water.
Kate will soon put you at your ease.
Helen, are you really engaged to Mr Throstle?
Tom had no right to say it.
I thought so.
I could see you weren't in love with him.
Oh, do you think that's reason enough not to marry him?
Of course.
Look here Helen, we'll make a bargain.
You help me out .. and I'll back you up.
Will you?
- Yes, I will.
Of course, I keep forgetting.
I can't interfere with things that happen.
That really do happen.
I mean ..
You see, my position here is so .. unusual.
You don't realize yet what your position here is.
They'll do anything you wish.
- Yes, but ..
You would never understand.
Perhaps.
Perhaps you really do marry him after all.
Never!
Oh, that's the spirit, Helen.
I don't care much for the little fellow.
And anyway, I'm quite sure there is nobody here good enough.
Why do you look at me like that?
I don't know.
Is there anything strange or wrong about me?
Strange or wrong?
I'm an American you know, just come into the New World.
That's why I'm nervous.
Is it?
No, no, don't go.
I've got nothing in common with the others.
All the others?
A most amazing fellow.
Never met anybody like him in my life.
Why it is no small privilege for a
Yankee to be permitted in this club.
Yet he patronizes the members.
Why only yesterday, he turned his back on the Prince Of Wales.
Thank heaven it was thought an accident.
Why did he, though?
- Oh ..
Because His Highness blew his nose with his fingers.
Have you also observed his ignorance of the petty details of everyday life?
And his nice disgust with so many of them?
We affect him, as a tribe of barbarians would affect us.
Yet he is an American .. a colonial.
It is the most absurd paradox.
This sounds not at all like my Yankee.
But then I've not seen him since we reached London.
Well, see him you shall.
For there is your rebel now.
Why, Standish.
Have I had the honour, sir?
My friend of 27 days in the packet from
New York pretends he doesn't know me?
Standish, have you forgotten Clinton?
Oh Major Clinton, of course.
Without travelling garb and dressed as a peacock, your mother wouldn't know you.
You don't seem the same man ashore.
You've taken the words out of my mouth.
You don't seem the same man on shore.
Well I must push off.
I have a sitting with
Sir Joshua Reynolds.
I will see you later.
"Push off"?
"See you later"?
[ Tut, tut, tut ]
You Americans seem to believe Mr Standish ..
That now you've broken away from England you will do great things in the Colon ..
I mean .. "The United States".
I suppose we shall.
You see our forefathers ..
I mean "we".
We have brought forth on this .. uh that, continent ..
A new nation .. conceived in liberty.
And dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.
All men are created equal?
But sir, that proposition is absurd.
Yes, it does seem a little cock-eyed, doesn't it.
"Cock .. eyed" ..?
That's an American word, Kate.
You see .. we've invented a new language over there.
You must instruct me.
Oh I .. I can paint no more today.
What is it Sir Joshua?
- Something.
Something in his face .. eludes me.
Why, have I not an ordinary face?
A face beyond all my experience of human nature.
But what expression in any face can elude the artist ..
Who painted for instance, Mrs Siddons?
The mistress of all expressions.
As the tragic muse.
Tragic muse?
Sir .. you make sport of me.
Make sport of you? But why and how?
No doubt you've talked with Mrs Siddons?
I've never spoken to Mrs Siddons in my life. I say only what everyone knows.
Surely ..
Surely the tragic muse is painted?
One sitting .. that is all.
I told her nothing .. not even my name, for the portrait.
Which no-one knows.
But you .. and your servant, sir.
I'm sorry I mentioned it.
Before it happened.
Good day, Sir Joshua.
Helen, are you afraid of me too?
How can I be afraid of somebody I'm .. sorry for?
Why are you sorry for me?-
Because you're unhappy with us.
You feel so strange here.
Yes I do.
I can't imagine what America is like.
But I suppose everything is so different.
And the people too ..
- Yes. Yes, that's it.
Everything is so different.
You know, they all liked me at first, your people.
And then I say something wrong.
I see it in their eyes.
Fear.
It is because you look through us.
You seem to know what we think.
Even what we are going to do next.
I don't understand you.
I wish I could help you.
- But you do, just by your sympathy.
Even though you can't possibly know how much I need it.
Do you?
The days are alright.
I go about your old London.
That's the most marvellous experience that ever came to a living man.
But when I lie in bed and think ..
It all seems a nightmare.
Until I remember you.
You're not like the others, you are ..
You're real.
I'm Kate's sister.
Kate, this is unlike you.
Our cousin does but the air with
Helen, to which no-one can object.
Since all the town knows he is promised to you.
Can you think me jealous, Ma'am?
It is not that.
When I'm with him, he makes me afraid.
And when she is with him ..
I'm afraid for her.
I'm afraid I am disgracing myself.
I've had only three lessons.
Do they not still dance the minuet in America, cousin?
Well, we have forgotten your polite measures.
Our dances are modelled on those of the negr ..
The Red Indians ..
Oh by gad, look at him!
Now that the dance has stopped, they all crowd around him.
Why, he's holding a meeting, by gad.
This life ..
Yes, it is rather amusing, isn't it.
And what impresses you most about London, Mr Standish?
Well, I don't know.
I think your sedan chairs.
Do not the quality of New York use sedan chairs?
Oh no, no. No, we ride in ..
In .. coaches ..
Most amazing, most amazing fellow.
Why, every morning two maids have to carry buckets of hot water ..
Up three flights of stairs for
Master Colonial to wash himself.
Wash himself all over?
- Every morning.
Washes himself all over?
Every morning?
What's all this talk of baths?
You took but one bath on the General Wolfe.
And you talked about that for a week beforehand.
I can't stand salt water.
Besides, bathing hasn't always been an eccentricity you know.
You admire the Romans.
The Romans bathed.
Only excessively sir, when they became degenerate.
The virile fathers of the republic ..
- Were as dirty as you are.
Yes, I suppose you are right.
Kate!
We haven't danced yet.
Do you suppose you could bear to with my clumsy steps?
Forgive me.
I promised this dance to ..
To Major Clinton.
Mr Standish.
Doctor Johnson informed me that you waited upon him this afternoon.
Oh yes .. yes.
I trust sir, that you were amused?
Yes, he thundered out a few platitudes.
Well sir, you can at least sympathize with the feelings of Englishmen ..
Who have been obliged to sign away a continent.
But do not grudge us Americans our poor stretches of wilderness, My Lord.
You, upon whose Empire, the sun never sets ..
Sir.
That is the most magnificent compliment ever paid to Great Britain.
Yes, it is rather a good phrase, isn't it.
But I expect you'd find it hackneyed if you'd heard it a 100 times before.
After all, why did we bother?
We would have eased the tax on tea, to end fighting.
What made you go on with the war?
- Well I ..
Just to make the world safe for democracy.
Democracy?
Peter .. the Duchess has asked me to present you.
Sir.
Duchess, Mr Peter Standish.
The Duchess of Devonshire.
My other guests.
May I have the honour, Duchess?
If you are to take my scalp, it must be by your wit.
Which they say is much better than your dancing.
First .. let me congratulate you.
Miss Pettigrew will make you a devoted wife.
There is nothing like the devotion of a married woman.
It's a thing no married man knows anything about.
Sir .. such views of matrimony ..
Are commonly entertained by that most ignoble work of God ..
A faithless husband.
Fidelity is a strange thing, Duchess.
When we are young, we try to be faithful and cannot.
When we are old we try to be faithless.
And cannot.
Oh, a delightful aphorism, sir.
Be seated.
If Helen is coy and shy.
It is that she would tease you, sir.
But I will speak with her.
Your American pyrotechnics make me feel as stupid as a girl at her first ball.
I can scarcely believe that I am ..
Well.
Who I am.
Georgina, Duchess of Devonshire.
You rolled it out as though you were announcing me at court.
All the charm of the period seems to centre in that name.
Flatterer! Admit that in America you've never even heard of me.
But what barbarian has not heard of the fifth Duchess?
Your name in English history is the finest flower of the age of elegance.
We know your face from Gainsebor ..
Er .. Gainsborough has painted you, hasn't he?
Yes.
All the legend and beauty of the age cling about you.
As powerful in politics, as irresistible in love.
What can the 18th Century offer that can compare with ..
Compare with ..
You speak of me so strangely.
I find your overwhelming compliments a little disturbing.
You were talking of me as we two might talk of Madame de Maintenant.
In the past tense.
Oh no, Duchess.
I never once used the past tense.
But you were thinking of me in the past tense.
Now I know what it is.
You have been talking about me as though ..
As though I were already .. dead.
I .. I have tried so hard to make an impression.
Sir .. you have made .. an indescribable .. impression.
Your arm, Sir Joshua.
Your self-assurance sir, is magnificent.
Are you so confident that Miss Pettigrew is not of a mind to break with you?
Kate? Break with me?
Listen, Throstle .. we're going to be married and have three children.
One dies of smallpox at the age seven, and is buried in St Mark's churchyard.
That's absurd, isn't it?
But you believe it, don't you?
Well .. since you can read
Miss Pettigrew's future ..
Perhaps you will inform me as to Miss Helen's?
Helen's?
No .. I don't know that.
Oh come on Throstle, can't you take a joke?
I don't know any more about the future than you do.
What have you been saying to the Duchess, Peter?
She's been repeating things that don't sound like you at all.
Oh .. I just dazzled her with a few cheap epigrams.
Made up by a fellow named "Oscar Wilde".
A friend of yours in New York?
No, no .. no, he's dead.
Or rather he's not ..
Never mind. It is a bit complicated.
You did indeed dazzle the Duchess, Peter.
But you made her afraid of you too.
My dear Lady Ann ..
Offence was taken by the Duchess.
It will be the talk of London tomorrow.
Kate.
You have danced with every Tom, Dick and Harry, and not once with Peter.
And you Helen.
You have not been even commonly civil to Mr Throstle.
Oh .. I'm .. just ..
I'm stranded.
Sir Joshua presents you his compliments by me.
He will paint you no more.
He will destroy your portrait.
The portrait will not be destroyed ..
And Sir Joshua will complete it.
Painters have good eyes.
What did Sir Joshua see?
Kate!
How did you first get into this house?
You walked in here.
But no-one saw you below.
You remember the rain?
His shoes were dry.
- Kate!
Madam, if I could have a few moments alone with Kate ..
Indeed yes, cousin. Oh, we must see to our other guests.
Come Mr Throstle, come Helen, come Tom.
And we are living in the 18th Century.
In the age of reason, the age of Voltaire.
Kate, there is nothing to be afraid of.
Sir Joshua saw it ..
That cursed picture again.
You mustn't talk like this.
We are going to be married.
In the morning I shall post to Budleigh.
I cannot stay in this house with you.
Kate, you can't break our engagement.
So .. you think there are no limits to what a wizard can do with a woman.
The women all press up to you, don't they.
But no woman wishes to dance with you twice ..
Excepting Helen.
You think you can make me marry you.
When I fear you .. as I fear the Devil!
Now listen, Kate.
We're going to be married, have children and live in this house .. that happens.
I'll not return while you're in this house.
In heaven's name, go back to America.
If that is where you come from.
But this marriage has to be.
You can't do this.
It didn't happen this way.
I've a woman's simple answer for your "can't do this" ..
I've been afraid to look into your eyes.
But now.
Look in mine.
And tell me that you love me.
Kate.
When you see me again.
I may be changed.
I might not seem the same man.
I may feel differently about Helen and Throstle.
If I do.
Promise me that you'll stand by Helen against them all.
Help her Kate .. she'll be alone. She'll need your help.
She will indeed need help if you take such an interest in her!
One o'clock!
A fine morning!
All .. is .. well ..!
Peter.
You know?
Kate is not herself tonight.
Oh, it isn't Kate's fault.
She's found out that ..
That I don't love her.
- But you want to marry her?
I had to play a part.
That was all.
Peter.
How can you speak of things that haven't happened yet?
How can you know things you couldn't know?
First .. about my shawl.
And since, so many things.
Helen ..
Things of tomorrow.
Seem as real to me as things of yesterday.
I want to see ahead.
The wonderful things that are coming.
After we are dead.
So, you're in love with the future.
As I was in love with ..
The mystery behind your eyes.
Tell me.
There aren't any words.
- No words.
But I think I can see through your eyes.
That isn't possible.
Yes, show me. I will see.
Helen, your eyes.
They burn.
It is this room.
It blazes with magic lights.
Not only this room.
All London outside.
Is lit by one movement of a man's hand.
There is your portrait on the wall. Finished.
You said it would be.
The veil is thin for you.
No more of this, Helen.
I must see.
Those devils! Demons!
Not men.
You've seen the future, Helen.
Oh, it is not true?
God wouldn't have put us here to suffer, for fiends like that to come after us.
Oh Helen.
Try to understand.
I come to you .. from somewhere else.
That other world ..
That world?
Now, you are afraid of me.
It's not true.
I love you.
Oh God help us both .. I love you.
I loved you before I ever saw you.
In my first dream of you.
Coming from somewhere far away to meet me.
Yes, but Helen.
I am not playing my part now.
I'm myself you see .. I'm myself.
This isn't possible.
It isn't my life or yours.
It isn't my world or yours.
- Then, take me with you Peter.
I can't. I can't.
- Then don't leave me.
I won't leave you.
When I kissed Kate.
That was his kiss ..
To his betrothed.
There has never been a kiss like that.
Since the world .. began.
Miss Helen .. sir.
Miss Helen.
It has been a week since I have able to ask about your health.
Has it been so long, Mr Throstle?
I trust sir you have found agreeable your rides about our countryside.
I love the English countryside.
Some men are more backward in confessing their affections.
Every tongue in London must be wagging.
Does he not avoid everyone since our reception?
Are they not seen together every day?
Why, is he not meant to have
Helen after Kate broke with him?
He'd not have leant me more money.
Press him, Ma'am .. press him.
I cannot force the young man to declare his intentions.
Ye gad, Ma'am. With this Yankee anything might happen. They must marry at once.
Mr Throstle, my Lady.
My dear sir.
We had hoped that your visits here were not to be discontinued.
In the "altered circumstances" you would say, Lady Ann.
Of course there can be no choice ..
Between my £1,500-a-year and your cousin's £10,000.
You know the world, sir.
One corner of it .. fairly well.
Indeed, it was evident from the start ..
That Helen and Mr Standish were made for one another.
And Mistress Kate?
Does she intend a long stay in the country?
She'd rather be bored to death in the country than scared to death in town.
Go to The Blue Boar and
I will send you word.
Yes Miss.
Kate, you cannot do it! Have you no feelings for your poor brother?
So .. because you've had his money and can't pay if we break with him ..
You would see your sister damned.
First, she puts aside
£10,000 a year for herself.
And now she posts to town to prevent
Helen from bringing it into the family.
Sir, is £10,000 a year worth the loss of Miss Helen's happiness?
What is this Mr Throstle?
Who spoke of loss of happiness?
Madam .. Mr Standish is no fit mate for any mortal woman.
You know .. you know.
Heaven will not permit it.
Kate, if you cannot master this strange perversity, you must return to Budleigh.
This has been the most lovely day of all.
He cast a spell on me.
But God took pity and saved me.
And I've returned to save Helen.
- Shush.
Mr Standish.
When you came into this house.
Though the door was shut and locked ..
Did you come from America?
I did .. that much at least is true.
I made a list of ten of his phrases.
He said they were used in New York.
On my way home,
I stopped at The Legation.
Should not the American
Minister, Mr Adams ..
Know what words are used in New York?
He .. he is from Massachusetts.
I asked him.
He'd never heard one of the ten.
So you see .. those words are not used in America.
They're not used in this world.
The Devils uses them in Hell!
Peter Standish came from
New York in the General Wolfe.
His body stands there.
But what have you done with him?
You've stolen his body.
What have you done with his soul?
"John Brown's body lies a moldering in his grave, his soul goes .."
A new Fire Of London.
That's what is needed here.
Yes, and a new plague too.
Dirt, disease, cruelty, smells.
Lord, how the 18th Century stinks!
Kate, you may be a fool.
But you're trying in your silly way to help Helen now. And I love you for that.
Madam.
I've seen you in Sheridan's plays.
I've read you in Jane Austen's novels.
You know what you want, and you plough straight ahead.
Over everything and through everything.
Like a tank, lumbering through the mud.
Do you hear that Kate? "Like a tank".
There is your eleventh strange word from the lexicon of Beelzebub.
Go to the American Legation and ask
Charles Francis Adams what "tank" means.
No, it isn't Charles Francis Adams who is Minister here now. It's ..
It is his Grandfather John Adams, second President of The United States.
Charles Francis Adams isn't even born yet.
He won't be Minister here until the civil war in 1861.
What's one blunder among so many?
Peter Standish came from New York to
Plymouth in the General Wolfe, did he?
Peter Standish came from New York to Plymouth in the Mauritania.
Shall I make a few more blunders for you to gibber at?
Shall I drive you back to Budleigh in my car? Fifty miles an hour!
No, not on a broomstick.
Shall I sell my portrait in America,
Ma'am, for thirty thousand pounds?
The Americans buy all the Reynolds's ..
What do I care about you?
You're all over and done with.
You're all dead, you're all rotted in your graves. You're all ghosts.
That's what you are .. ghosts!
Stop her! She'll tell Helen.
You dead and buried little pipsqueak.
Returnez Satanist!
Exorcism!
Throstle casts out the Devil.
So you would send me back to Hell, where I came from, would you?
I'm to vanish in a clap of thunder, am I?
I'll set ten Devils on you!
Ahh!
Imprisonment.
Imprisonment for life.
For life .. for life.
In this filthy little pigsty of a world.
Peter.
Oh Helen .. Kate knows.
And Throstle.
- Yes, Peter.
They tell me how you feel buried alive among the dead.
Now, you can never see them again.
- No.
Never again.
We'll go away together .. to America.
People would hate and fear you anywhere.
Why should they hate me?
They hate what they fear.
Just as you fear and hate them.
I can face them all.
For you belong to me ..
Not them.
I'm strong now.
Don't make me weak again.
Each night I've said ..
"He must go back".
But each morning when we ride away together .. I think ..
Let me have only one more day.
Helen, I couldn't face my own life without you.
What life is this for you?
Be brave Peter .. and listen.
We two alone have been chosen for this wonder.
Out of all the millions of lovers since time began.
Our love is more real than if you had been born in my world.
Or I in yours.
Because .. it is a miracle.
That we've come together at all, proves we weren't meant to lose each other.
Yes .. yes.
And we shall be together, always Peter.
Not in my time .. nor in yours.
But in God's.
But Helen, I want you now.
You can't want me to go back.
You love me.
With all my soul.
Then I stay here.
Stay then, Peter.
For life, for love!
A life of nightmare that never ends.
So that you may live on in my world in a living death. Mad.
Is it because you love me, that you condemn me to that?
You do see it.
Leave me while our love is still beautiful.
I ask it for my sake.
You have your own life to live out in the future, Peter.
Don't be too sad there about a girl who's been dead so long.
As I grow old.
Your youth will seem to me eternal youth.
For you will come, won't you?
Young as I see you now, to my grave in St Mark's churchyard.
To you, that will be tomorrow.
And yet ..
To the generations after I am dead.
I'll ask for a stone with the letters cut deep.
So they won't wear away before you come to me.
And you must come alone.
But if you love that other girl.
You must marry her.
Oh don't ..
But you can't live in this house with only that old woman to look after you.
When that happens, I shall be ..
And yet I am jealous.
Even though I will be dead.
Helen.
I love you only.
Now .. and in my own time.
And in whatever other times may come.
I believe.
Forgive me.
If only you could take back with you just one thing that was mine.
Father got this in Egypt when the fleet was there.
In some strange way.
It has meant so much to me.
The Crux Ansata.
What is it?
It's the symbol of life.
Of eternity.
Then that is why I loved it so.
Helen.
That was mine.
Long ago.
Yours? Long ago?
It was here.
When I first entered this house.
In the future.
Then this little thing has crossed the great darkness between us.
Mine while I live.
And yours in that world that I shall never see.
This was our parting.
[ Thunderclap! ]
No more dear shadows.
Has Mr Standish come in yet?
Yes, Miss. He came in just as the clock struck five-thirty.
Where had he been?
He said he had been to St Mark's churchyard.
I'm so sorry to have brought you here.
But I was so worried.
I didn't know where he'd gone.
That's quite alright my dear.
Mrs Barwick.
Has anything particular happened since I was here last?
Well sir, Mr Standish has been drinking quite a lot.
Why only yesterday, he told me he had just come from the 18th Century.
Yes, he tried to get into Brookes' club, insisting he was a member.
They had to throw him out.
- Hmm.
His old mania.
But when he came in just now ..
He seemed more like his old self.
Quieter .. if you know what I mean.
I see.
Well, my dear.
What would you like me to do?
Wait here.
I'll go up to him, and see for myself.
Last night, some people came with some I.O.U.'s he'd given them.
He yelled at them, sir.
He told them they weren't alive.
And that they wouldn't be born for another hundred years.
Marjorie.
Peter .. you know me?
Of course.
I'm afraid ..
Peter Standish has been giving you an awful lot of trouble.
Well, you haven't been yourself, dear.
But it's alright now.
We were going to be married.
You and I.
It seems so very long ago.
You remember?
If you remember me .. you can't think any longer that you are ..
He.
Marjorie .. something has happened.
Something that you could never believe.
And now I ..
I must live here ..
Alone.
In this house?
Alone?
I shall keep this room.
Just as it was.
Always.
Peter, you can't do ..
Why .. what is that paper you have?
An epitaph.
I just copied it just now from a tombstone in St Mark's churchyard.
Whose epitaph is it?
A girl who died.
A hundred and forty-six years ago.
Who was she?
0h.
A cousin of Peter Standish.
It is Latin .. what does it mean?
Peter.
You are crying.
Who was that girl who's been dead for ages?
Peter .. speak to me.
Don't you know me?
Would you .. rather l go?
Hic Jacet
"Here lies .."
"In the confident hope."
"Of the blessed resurrection and life eternal."
"Helen Pettigrew."
"Beloved younger daughter of Sir William Pettigrew K.B."
"Vice Admiral of the Blue."
"And the Lady Ann Pettigrew."
"Who."
"Who departed this life .."
"June the 15th."
"1787."
"Aged."
"Twenty-three."
"Years."
[ Helen: ]
"We shall be together always, Peter."

"But in God's .."

May I give you a lift, sir?
Thank you. No.
I have an appointment... a lady and gentleman.
Oh, I'm sorry. I...
I thought you signaled me.
No...
Not yet.
Care for a lift?
Thank you.
Quite welcome, sir.
I'm afraid we're not going very far.
I know.
What's that?
You will take me as far as you are going.
That will be far enough.
It was a doctor's car.
See the green cross?
2 people... man and his wife,
I guess.
Both killed, huh?
Anybody see it?
Yeah, 2 people were killed... a man and a woman.
Oh!
Oh, dear!
Yes...
Yes, I'll call right over.
Miss Riffle, sit down here for me.
Here. Now, this is shocking news.
I'm sincerely sorry.
Can I get something for you... a glass of water?
Sue's my only sister.
I don't know what
I'll do without her.
Only yesterday she promised me a trip to California.
I've been planning...
Yes, yes.
Just a moment.
Charlie, miss Riffle has had so sad news.
Would you get my car and drive her over to
Dr. Northrup's home?
Yes, yes. Surely.
They tickle.
Hey, don't strangle them that way, son.
They got work to do.
Put them in the can.
Think we'll catch a lot of fish today, Gramps?
Think we'll catch a whole lot of fish?
Like as not, son.
Think we'll catch a whale, Gramps?
You can't never tell.
You wouldn't be afraid of a whale, would you, Gramps?
Darned right, I wouldn't.
Not even a great big giant whale?
Well, I never run away from one yet.
Don't never touch this stuff, son.
Give me some?
No, no. Come on.
Let's get going.
Julian!
Just a little taste.
No. You wouldn't like it.
What do you drink it for, Gramps?
Oh, on account of my chest.
Julian!
Oh, because your granny's yelling for us to come and take out that smelly dog.
But I like the way Betty smells.
Well, you're welcome to her, son.
When you two get together, you're as deaf as a post.
Was you calling us, miss Nellie?
I didn't hear you.
Oh, look at you now, tracking mud all over the place.
Pud, take that filthy thing off the table.
They're only worms, grandma.
Oh! Put it out on the porch.
My goodness, take it away.
# Aunt Demetria's a pismire #
# Aunt Demetria's a pismire #
Say, pud, you mustn't use that word about your aunt Demetria.
You said she was a pismire.
That boy's getting to be the limit.
First thing you know, you'll be teaching him how to smoke, I suppose, and then drink and goodness knows what all.
Well, there will be plenty of time for the what all, old lady.
Oh, Julian.
Oh, miss Nellie.
Here. Put those in your pocket.
He mimics everything you do.
Julian?
Huh?
Ahem.
What is a pismire?
A pismire is the meanest ant there is, and aunt Demetria is a pismire.
She's a good, right-minded woman, and I won't hear a word against her.
Then don't follow me,
'cause I say she's a pismire.
She's no such thing.
She's a narrow-minded, troublemaking, blue-nosed old pismire, and you know it.
She's a decent, self-respecting woman.
Oh, dear. I've got that gas started again.
Every time I get excited, it starts.
Well, then, don't get excited, then.
I'll take the worms.
Shall I, Gramps?
Can I take the worms?
That's right, son.
There's some cookies.
Thank you, miss Nellie.
Bye, old lady.
Bye, grandma.
Bye, son.
We're going to catch a whale.
Darn right, we are.
Pud!
I do believe that's aunt Demetria.
Aw, talk of the...
Wonder what that old sow bug wants.
Hello, demmy.
I think we better go inside.
I must speak to you alone.
Well... well, what is it, demmy?
Here, pud.
You hold that.
I'll be right out in a minute.
Demmy, it isn't...
Now, old girl, can't be nothing serious.
Go on. Go on in.
Go ahead.
Don't be long, Gramps, will you, Gramps?
No, no, no, son.
No, no, no.
Ding dong!
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!
Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding!
Hello, Mr. Wentworth.
Hello, pud.
If you want to see my dad, he's not here.
He went to gainesville to make a call.
I went to gainesville once, but mom went with dad today.
Yes, pud.
I'm going to be a doctor when I grow up.
You bet you are.
You're going to be as good a doctor as your daddy.
Maybe better.
Here comes Casey Jones and his express!
Get out of the way!
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!
Oh, really,
Mr. Northrup.
This is too generous.
I... well, I don't know what to say.
That's perfectly all right, sir.
It's a real pleasure.
It's just what my son would have wished.
That was a grand sermon you gave for Jim and his wife.
Did me good to hear all the fine things you said about him, and I thank you kindly.
And how, uh, how is Mrs. Northrup?
Oh. If you could manage to stop by now and again, it would be a real comfort to her.
I'll be glad to.
I've noticed that the Northrup pew is rather empty these days.
Grandpa and me always run and hide when grandma calls us to go to church, don't we, Gramp?
Why, now, young man, wouldn't you like your grandpa to bring you along some Sunday?
Sure. I want to hear you talk.
Oh, you do?
Gramps says you talk like an old woman.
Heh heh heh.
Well, now, young man, you don't lend me much socially.
I think it's high time for us to crawl into a hole.
Good afternoon, sir.
Bye, Mr. Murdock.
That's a good deed done, if I do say so myself.
Did you do a good deed, Gramps?
Yep. I give a mite more than what is expected.
If you do a good deed, you can make a wish, and it'll come true.
Is that so?
That's what my storybook says.
Well, must be so, then.
So make a wish, Gramp.
Make a wish.
Well, I will, son, soon as I think up a good one.
Would a giant hit his head on that telephone wire, Gramp?
Well, he'd have to duck some.
Can god see through the sky, Gramp?
Mm-hmm.
Can he see right through our house?
Right you are, son.
Gramp, where do people go when they die?
Where the woodbine twineth.
Grandfather, are you going to die?
Not yet awhile, son.
Are you sure?
Don't you fret, pud.
I'll be with you quite a while yet.
I feel as spry as a cricket.
I love you, grandpa.
I think I love you best of anybody in the world.
Heh heh.
God bless you, son.
That means a lot to me, pud.
Thank you.
Look who's coming.
Let's sneak into schroeder's and get an ice-cream soda.
Humph! Those two.
Thought I didn't see them sneaking into schroeder's.
Pud... of all the nasty, ill-bred little rats in chatfield.
That's Julian's work for you.
Hello, miss Riffle.
You look as though you were listening to the singing of the angels.
I was thinking,
Mr. Wentworth.
I've got little pud on my mind.
Say, hear his dad left him a pot of money.
What?
Jim must have collected some fancy fees for his operations.
He left a lot of insurance, too.
Heavenly day!
Good thing for the boy.
I was worried about that child.
I always thought Jim spent every nickel he made, he was so generous.
Going my way?
I got my little bus at the corner.
No, I think I'll run over and visit grandma Northrup... poor soul.
Well, so long.
See you Friday.
Demmy, I'm tired...
So tired.
Oh, Nellie.
If it wasn't for Julian and pud,
I declare, I'd give up.
Demmy, sometimes I think you're the person to see to it that pud gets the right bringing up when I've passed on.
Me?
And then again,
I think Julian wouldn't know how to live without that boy.
Well, Nellie,
I've thought about it, but I couldn't afford to give pud the things he's been used to.
I mean, unless
Jim left a will or something like that.
Oh, he did, demmy.
He left a will.
Well, think of that.
And how mu...
I mean, is the lamby well taken care of?
Yes. Jim left $55,000.
Well, the dear little lamby.
Maybe you're right, Nellie.
Of course, there's no great rush.
Guess I got a few years left in me yet.
Well, I should hope so.
55 thou...
Bless his little heart.
Julian never catches him.
Always starts bellowing so as to give him time to get away.
Nasty brats. Stealing other people's property.
Stop stealing our apples!
Get the tarnation out of that tree, you old bully!
You thieving rascal!
I'll give you such a tanning... he's getting away, Gramps!
Get away, you thieving varmint!
Aw, Gramps!
He got away!
He didn't wait!
Come back here!
Stealing my golden russets.
By gosh, I swear,
I wish that anybody that climbed that tree would have to stay up there until I let him down.
Gramps! You made a wish!
You made a wish!
Huh?
A wish. You wished that anybody would have to stay up in the tree until you let them down.
A lot of good it will do me.
Gee, Gramps, I bet we catch one of those bad boys up there and maybe keep them there till 19 years.
Maybe for a hundred years.
Well, it'd serve them good and right. Here.
Thanks, Gramps.
Maybe a thousand years, Gramps.
Maybe we would never let him down, would we, Gramps?
No, sir.
Oh. Hello, demmy.
Poor little lamby.
Poor little orphan lamb.
What's the matter?
Is he still thinking of his poor mama and papa?
Oh, let him alone, for heaven's sake.
Well!
Let me go!
There, there, lamby.
Your aunt Demetria understands.
You must be a brave boy-boy.
Mama's gone to a better place above the clouds.
Oh, let him alone!
Let me go!
Do you deny the poor child loving comfort with his parents hardly cold in their graves?
Oh, you're the devil with your loving comfort.
Come here, pud.
I hate you!
Now you know.
Do you hear me, pud?
Come here to me!
Like heck he will.
Like heck I will!
See? See? You wicked old man.
You wretched sepulcher!
What did you... now, by Jupiter, that does it!
You get out of here.
Get out of this house!
And if I ever find you here again, you squid-faced old bird stuffer,
I'll wring your blasted neck and dance on it!
Julian!
You mischief-making old harridan!
You pismire!
Oh!
Oh, that makes me so mad.
That makes me so gol darn mad!
Oh, pud, how about getting me a nice cold glass of water?
Sure, Gramps.
Huh?
What is that?
Mr. Julian Northrup,
I believe.
What's that?
I didn't catch it.
Most people don't hear me the first time.
How the blazes could I hear you if I was asleep?
You sure you were asleep?
Well, I must have drowsed off.
Felt kind of tired all of a sudden.
Say, who are you?
What do you want?
I want you to come with me.
Why? Where are you going?
Where the woodbine twineth.
Where the woodbi... why, I said that.
I made it up.
But it's what you say to a child.
I ain't no child!
Aren't you?
No, I ain't!
Say, who the devil are you?
They call me Mr. Brink.
Well, now, look here,
Mr. Brink,
I don't like you.
I wouldn't go with you to a rat fight.
So now you know.
Sorry.
I don't like the way you snuck up here.
I don't like the way you talk.
There, you see...
It's time for you to come with me.
No, it ain't.
No! It ain't
I ain't going nowhere!
I'm going to stay right here.
I'm waiting for pud.
Get the blazes away from here!
Get off of my son's property!
Get off of here before I...
Julian!
Huh?
Who you shouting at that way?
Well, I...
There was a fella here.
I...
Well, I'll be dipped in gravy.
Gramps, who was that man?
You seen him?
Did you, son?
Huh?
Sure. He was coming down the walk.
Who was he?
Don't rightly know who he was.
What did he want?
He wanted me to go along with him.
Where?
Where the woodbine twineth.
Here, son.
It's getting kind of chilly out here.
I think we'd better get away from this place.

Hee hee hee!
Gee, Gramps! We sure caught a heap of fish, didn't we?
Come here, you big
Fisher-isher you.
Smell, Gramps.
Mmm! Just like violets!
We going to eat him for dinner, Gramps?
Are we, Gramps?
Well, I don't know, son.
Mostly have chicken and dumplings on Sunday.
Hey! Put him back in the pail!
You're wearing him all out!
Heh heh heh!
There's a street cop, Gramps.
Oh, you don't say?
Better slow down.
Reckon I had.
Must be doing all of 15.
Give him a raspberry, Gramps.
Little old buttercup here is proud and takes her time, but she always delivers where we're going.
Good old buttercup.
Year in and year out, runs like a song.
Loyalty. That's what I call it.
Loyalty.
She sure picked a sweet place to stop.
Sure did, Gramp.
Miss Nellie, that was the finest blueberry pie
I ever had.
I'm about finished this fob for pud.
Looks pretty good, too, if I do say so myself.
Still mad at me, Nellie?
Well, I like to see you best that way... eyes all shining.
That's when you look prettiest.
Oh, fiddlesticks.
Julian Northrup, don't you try to soft-soap me.
I was downright ashamed of you this morning, you and that boy.
I don't know which is the dirtiest.
Julian, you're a bad influence on pud, and it's got to be stopped.
Nellie.
Oh, take that silly thing out of your eye.
I'm serious.
I've been closing my eyes to the way you've been ruining pud.
Oh, miss Nellie!
Julian, you and I can't raise a little boy all by ourselves.
We're too old.
Oh, sure we can.
Same way we raised Jim.
Aw, now.
There, there, there, miss Nellie.
Now...
I guess you and me can raise one little boy.
Why, he ain't got one of my bad traits.
He's the spitting image of you and Jim.
Got the same color blue eyes as you, too.
He's going to be a fine-looking little card like his granny.
Say, you look mighty smart in that new dress.
Aw, go along with you.
Aw, now, old lady, don't you go worrying about pud.
I'll keep on teaching him to cuss, and you keep on teaching him not to cuss.
You'll see.
He'll turn out to be pretty good.
We've got to find some other way to raise that boy.
There ain't nobody else going to raise that boy but us.
Julian, I've heard the voice of heaven.
You've heard the voice of Demetria.
No, it wasn't.
It was from above.
It was Demetria.
Julian Northrup, I guess
I know the difference between the voice of heaven and the voice of Demetria Riffle.
Yoo-hoo! Nellie!
Anybody home?
Talk of the devil.
Julian.
Come in, demmy.
Now, you mind your manners.
I had to stop by and see how you were, Nellie, even if I'm not welcome.
I bought you some of those pills from lawbecks.
He says they're wonderful for settling gas.
Careful what you're taking there.
# Aunt Demetria's a pismire #
# Aunt Demetria's a pismire #
# Aunt Demetria... #
Julian?
I never taught him that.
You're a liar.
Maybe I am.
Now, pud, you go tell your aunt demmy you're sorry.
That's all right, Nellie.
I know when words are put into a child's mouth.
And has my little boy-boy a great big kiss for his aunt demmy today?
No.
Now, pud, you give aunt demmy a nice kiss.
She kisses awful wet.
Hee hee!
Well, I like that!
Good afternoon, miss Riffle.
Here's your medicine,
Mrs. Northrup.
Aw, thank you, Marcia.
Feel a little rumbly.
You don't mean to tell me you've got that Marcia Giles in this house.
Why, yes. She came to help us after...
Well, what? She's a good straightforward girl, isn't she?
Well?
Guess it ain't any of my business.
What are you driving at anyway?
She's carrying on with that young bill Lowry, that's what.
Good.
Kissing in the park!
Kissing like you never saw!
Fairly made your blood boil!
Good!
If they carry on like that in public, what must they do when they're alone?
Why, demmy, maybe they just kiss.
Are you willing to have that kind of girl in your house around where pud is?
I'd let her go... what do you mean, that kind of girl?
She's nothing but a common... you're a blasted liar!
Don't talk to demmy like that, Julian.
We don't know...
I know.
I knew she was a nice girl the minute I seen her.
Ye gods, that makes me mad.
That makes me so cussing mad!
Me, too, Gramps.
Stop your swearing,
Julian Northrup.
If you listen to one word more this viper has to say, you're just a plain fool!
Julian, don't you call me a fool!
Don't you call me a fool.
I'm disappointed in you, miss Nellie.
I'm disappointed in you!
Oh! Oh!
There, now, you tired yourself all out.
You better rest a spell.
Let me help you to your room.
Yes. I guess I will... naw! Get out of the way!
I'll help you, miss Nellie.
No, you won't, Julian.
I only want them to help me that know how to help me.
Blue-nosed old bird stuffer.
Even makes me fight with miss Nellie.
Old pismire.
Can't call me a fool.
Can't say he's disappointed in me.
I don't know how you stand for it, Nellie.
How's your gas?
Feels a little quieter.
Are you going to speak to Marcia?
I don't know.
If you just saw them kissing...
Why, Nellie Northrup, don't tell me... all right, demmy, but I sure hate to let her go.
She needs the money so bad.
There's things more important than money, Nellie.
I know.
Oh.
Nellie, weakly:
Feel kind of funny.
Julian don't mean all the things he says.
He's just a rough-spoken man.
Hmm.
Good looking man, too, in his day.
I remember him at a party when the old century went out.
Handsome as anything.
Everybody was after him.
He was always a pretty good... demmy, would you go and ask Julian to step in here for a minute?
Now, Nellie, you're not going to forgive him?
Well...
I just want to talk to him.
Nellie...
Don't you think I should go down to Mr. Pilbeam's office in the morning and have the papers drawn up for you to sign about the adoption and all?
Adoption?
You said I was the one to bring pud up.
Oh, I was just wondering about it, demmy.
You said it, Nellie.
Now, see here, demmy,
I never said a word about you adopting pud.
You're trying to put words in my mouth.
I don't like the way you're acting, demmy.
Nellie Northrup, you said yourself
I should bring pud up!
Well, if I did, I was wrong.
I can see that now.
Oh, dear.
I better talk with Julian.
There, now. Don't think about it, Nellie.
You'll have a nice nap, and I'll come and see you tomorrow.
Don't forget to tell Julian to come in here a minute.
I won't.
There's a boy going up that apple tree.
I can just catch him nicely.
Nasty little thief.
You little rat.
You come down from that tree.
Come on, son!
Want your stick, Gramps?
You're a thief!
Here it is!
Hurry! Hurry!
Come down, or I'll have the law on you.
I'll teach you to trespass.
You'll do what?
There's a boy up there.
I should think you'd thank me for catching a trespasser.
How was you aiming to teach him not to trespass?
I'd give him a sound whipping.
That's what I'd do.
Oh, you would?
Well, thanks for telling me.
Seeing as how there's 2 trespassers here,
I'll start on the one handiest.
Don't be silly, Julian.
Hit her, Gramps!
Hit her a whopper!
You little brat, you... brat?!
Get off of this property.
Get off our property!
Maybe you'll find out whose property this is someday.
You'll find out that I can look after my own!
Sometimes the law has something to say.
Go on!
Get out of here!
Go on, miss pickle face!
Why don't you come down?
My britches is caught.
Go on, son.
Unloosen your britches and come down as fast as you can.
Yes, sir.
My britches is loose now.
Aw, Gramps, you shouldn't have told him to get down.
We could have kept him up there a million years.
Come here, Sonny.
Come here.
Now, the next time you want some apples, don't sneak in the back.
Come right up to the front stoop and ask for them.
Here.
Will you do that?
Yes, sir.
Like heck, he will.
I used to like to steal apples.
They tasted better that way.
Now you know, Gramps,
I can't get down until you let me.
That's right.
Hope you don't keep me up here too long, Gramps.
Well, maybe weeks, maybe a hundred years.
All depends on how I feel.
Then I'm coming down, Gramps.
Well, I guess
I'll go along right now.
I'm coming along.
Gramps, I can't get loose.
Of course.
You can't get loose till I tell you honest I can't, Gramps.
Well, you can't go breaking my spells thataway.
Let me down, Gramps!
Let me down, please!
My arm's tired!
Gramps, let me go!
Gramps!
All right, Sonny.
Drop down. Let go.
Why, boy, what's the matter with you?
What is it?
I couldn't let go.
Oh, of course, you could.
I couldn't, Gramps.
I thought you was only fooling.
I was fooling at first, then my hands couldn't move.
The tree was holding me.
By golly, boy.
You give a fella the creeps.
Doggone if I don't believe you thought that tree really was holding you.
It was, Gramp.
It was!
Aw, shucks.
That old apple tree couldn't hold nobody.
Yes, it could, Gramps.
You wished it could.
Gramps, I hurt my hand.
Want a heap of tape.
Well, come on, Sonny boy.
We'll get some tape.
Come on.
Adhesive tape will fix up most anything.
Say, Marcia.
Slip into the bathroom for a piece of sticking plaster like a good girl, will you?
This young man's wounded.
Aw!
And some 'curochrome, too.
What you doing?
I'm fixing a cup of tea for
Mrs. Northrup.
Good. We'll bring it in to her.
We're in Dutch again, Marcy.
Got to make our peace.
All right,
Mr. Northrup.
The water will be ready in minute.
Hey, Marcy, what in blazes do you mean by kissing men in the park?
What?
Don't you know it's a sin to kiss men in the park?
Next time, bring him up here and kiss him.
Oh, Mr. Northrup.
It's bill Lowry.
We've been engaged all summer.
That's fine.
It's time this house had some kissing in it.
How the heck's young pud here going to learn anything about kissing if he don't never see none of it?
Is that you, Marcia?
Yes, Mrs. Northrup.
Is anything wrong?
No, there's nothing wrong.
I'm just kind of tired.
Going to go to sleep in a minute.
Let's see.
There was something
I was supposed to talk to you about.
What was it?
Oh, well.
I've forgotten.
Couldn't have been very important.
Marcy.
Yes, Mrs. Northrup?
Marcy, dear...
Just see that Julian always has his pipe.
Will you do that?
Yes, Mrs. Northrup.
You're a good girl, Marcy.
Now, go on back to whatever you were doing.
Shall I turn off the radio, Mrs. Northrup?
No, dear.
They're playing
Stephen foster's tunes.
I'm hoping they'll play
beautiful dreamer.
That's my favorite.
Is that you, Julian?
No, I'm not Julian.
Who is it?
It's Mr. Brink.
You seem rather tired.
I am kind of tired,
Mr. Brink.
Yes, I know.
Well, you're to come with me now.
Come with you...
Brink?
I don't know any... see here.
What call have you to come butting into a lady's bedroom?
I usually come to bedrooms.
It's so much more comfortable.
What is?
Come with me.
Why should anyone want to go with you?
It's customary.
Oh.
Well, you might as well sit down and wait.
You needn't think
I'll stir a step until
I finish this mitten.
I'm narrowing off at the top now.
Yes, I know you are.
Oh, what do you know about knitting?
I don't mean the mitten.
I mean you.
What a fool thing to say.
You ready?
Oh, wait...
Just a minute.
I'm almost finished now.
There.
That's got it.
Don't the red stripe look well with the gray?
Excellent, my dear.
Excellent.
Come now.
Knock again, Gramps.
Shh!
Miss Nellie, we brought you a cup of tea.
Still mad at me, Nellie?
Hmm?
This frog's getting kind of old.
Yeah. It does smell kind of rich.
He's a very fine specimen, though.
Yes. Well, we'll get another one, Sonny.
Gramps.
Huh?
I'll throw this smelly frog where he won't bother us.
Yes.
That's fine, son.
That's fine.
No, no, Betty.
That ain't her.
Mr. Northrup, lunch is nearly ready.
Oh, thank you kindly, Marcy.
I don't feel very hungry.
Oh, Mr. Northrup, you haven't eaten a good meal for a week, and when you don't eat, pud hardly eats a mouthful, either.
That's just what she said.
"He mimics everything you do."
He does.
Oh, Marcy, if I had only got there in time.
Don't take it so hard,
Mr. Northrup.
She died and didn't forgive me.
Oh, but she did,
Mr. Northrup.
Why, she would have forgiven you anything.
Oh, I almost forgot.
Frog won't smell anymore, Gramp.
That's good, pud.
Lunch is about ready.
I'm not hungry.
Well, hungry or not, you got to eat to keep up your strength.
It's only me and you left, pud.
Only you and me.
We got to hang together.
You're darn tootin'.
Now, don't cuss, pud.
Your granny didn't like it.
Let's you and me turn over a new leaf, pud.
What for?
Well, so your aunt demmy won't keep on saying
I ain't good for you.
Aw, we'll kill her!
We'll kill her, and we'll put her in the ground, and we'll throw dirt on top of her.
Hush, pud. Hush.
Here's your pipe,
Mr. Northrup.
I filled it for you.
My pipe, Marcy?
Oh, no. I don't think I can smoke.
In fact, I ain't smokin' no more.
Miss Nellie didn't like it.
Oh, but she did,
Mr. Northrup.
I know she did.
No. She thought it was a dirty habit.
She told me I was always to keep your pipe filled.
Miss Nellie told... when?
Just before she died.
She caught hold of my hand, and she said... now, wait. I'll remember her exact words.
She said, "Marcy, see that
Julian always has his pipe."
Now, look here, Marcy, you ain't tellin' me that just to make me feel good?
Oh, no, Mr. Northrup.
I couldn't do that.
Give me that pipe, Marcy.
It's just like miss Nellie was handing it to me herself.
Does it taste good, Gramp?
Better than anything I ever knew.
What have we got for lunch, Marcy?
I could eat an ox.
I could eat 2 ox.
Right away,
Mr. Northrup.
Oh, yes.
That rif... miss Riffle phoned again.
She keeps asking about your health.
She does, does she?
That gol darned old buzzard.
She's just waiting for me to die.
Confound it, Marcy.
I've been asleep at the switch.
We're going to eat a whacking big lunch, and then I'm going downtown.
I got some business to attend to.
Hurry up and get through lunch as fast as you can.
All right,
Mr. Northrup.
I got to put a clean rig on this young fella.
Gee, Gramps, we feel better, don't we?
We sure do, son.
We sure do!
Hello, Ben.
Hello,
Mr. Pilbeam.
Hello, pud.
Have a seat.
This is bill Lowry, my assistant.
Mr. Northrup, master Northrup.
Oh, you're Marcy Giles' young man.
How do you do?
You're bill the kisser.
Hey, young man.
I got a brand new hammock on my porch that's going plumb to waste.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Ha ha.
Say, Ben.
I been figuring on making some provision for his nibs here after I'm gone.
You know, a guardian for him and his money so that sanctimonious old she-cat can't get her hands on it.
I aim to leave my bit to Marcy Giles, so she can't grab that, you see.
Well, as to a guardian,
Julian, what you should worry about is not the future, but the present.
The present?
Why, I ain't dead yet.
To be plain, miss Riffle threatens to remove the boy from your charge.
Demetria?!
To adopt him legally... Now.
What?
What's that?
On grounds that you're not a suitable guardian for a child... your religious qualifications or the lack of them.
Oh, well, maybe we can do something about that.
Best to face facts.
She's got some pretty strong arguments to present to a court.
Perhaps you could make some concession.
Well, don't you bother about it,
Pilbeam.
I didn't make no concession at bull run when I was too young, and I didn't make none at San Juan hill.
They said I was too old then.
So I'll be hanged if I'm going to make any now to any frostbitten, backstabbing...
Pismire.
Pismire like Demetria Riffle.
Thank you, boy.
I ain't through fighting yet, Ben.
I'll show this town there ain't nobody can take what belongs to me away from me.
Give me my hat, boy.
Come on.
Let's get.
I feel awful funny, Gramp.
You got nothing on me, boy.
This hurts me more than it does you, pud.
Marcy!
Well, come on, girl.
Tell us the worst.
Oh, I'm so sorry, gentlemen, but the northrups aren't at home just now.
Is that so?
They've gone to church, where all the best people go.
Indeed?
Well, when they come back, will you please tell them we was here and left our visiting cards?
Good day, madam.
Good day, gentlemen.
Oh, gosh, it's hot.
It sure is... hot as... uh-uh. Hades, son. Hades.
Golly, this collar's choking me to death.
Well, we betterlar's get started. O death.
Wish it was downhill all the way.
What's the matter, Gramp?
What is it, Gramp?
What's the matter?
Nothing, son.
Just run inside.
In the pocket of my overcoat, you'll find a bottle.
The camel, Gramp?
My tonic.
Mr. Northrup.
Huh?
It's you again.
Can't I shut my eyes without you butting in?
What do you want here anyway?
I thought, perhaps, now you would like to come.
Now, look here,
Mr. Brink.
I ain't going with you at all.
I'm going to church with this young fella here, and you're about as welcome as a fly on a currant bun.
So now you know.
Your similitudes are a trifle earthy, but your meaning is clear.
Similitudes?
What kind of talk is that?
Sure. What kind of talk is it?
You can't talk worth snakes.
Go on! Get away from here!
Get off of my property!
Let's not be difficult about it.
Your wife was so charming to me.
Miss Nellie?
Is she well?
I can only tell you that she has changed.
Miss Nellie changed?
Ha ha! That's what you think.
My dear man, let's not argue the point.
This time you can't fight me away.
Come now.
I can't.
It's time.
No, no, now.
You go on. Get.
I got to stay and look after my boy.
I've got to go to church.
So easy and so pleasant.
Look at me.
No, no. I can't.
I won't!
Now...
No, no.
Not yet, Mr. Brink.
Not yet. Please!
Gramp!
Shh, boy.
Mr. Brink, before I go, could I have one of my golden russets?
I hate to leave them when they're spoiling to be ate.
Oh, very well, but be quick.
I have many appointments.
I wonder if you'd kindly get one for me.
They're out of my reach.
Curious request.
Why not?
This one?
They're riper over there.
This one?
Neither! I don't want none of them.
I got you up that tree, and I'm going to keep you there till I say you can come down.
You got him, Gramp!
You got him!
By golly, son, I believe I have!
Mr. Northrup says they're celebrating something.
It's a secret, and they won't tell me.
Secret, aye?
Sounds like a big occasion.
You should have seen the supper that they got away with.
Everything Mr. Northrup isn't supposed to eat:
Steak and mushrooms and cucumber salad, creamed onions and pickled beets, and now this.
# Where the Lincoln gunboats ran #
Ice cream!
Oh, boy!
What are Lincoln gunboats, Gramp?
They was the boats that fought for
Mr. Lincoln.
He was the head man on our side, during the war.
Yes, sir. He was the greatest man this country ever had.
Talk about it, Gramps.
Oh, you know all about that.
Well, what's that?
By golly! Betty's after Mr. Brink.
Come on, son!
Come here, Betty!
Betty!
Betty, come here.
Here, Betty.
Here, Betty.
Betty, come here!
Oh, this is the crowning indignity.
I'm sorry,
Mr. Brink.
I think that hereafter
I shall be invisible.
Look, Gramp!
Look!
He's gone, Gramp!
Mr. Brink!
It's really less complicated this way.
Oh. So long as you're still there.
Betty! Betty! Come here!
Betty, Betty!
Come...
Betty... wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
There's something wrong here.
Yes. She's gone.
Betty!
Get away!
Don't touch anything.
Don't touch a thing!
Got to do something about this the first thing in the morning.
Yes, sir.
That tree's deadly.
Hey, keep away from that tree!
Doggone, I told you that!
Sorry.
Sorry don't do no good.
Say, you fellows can knock off for lunch now.
Be back on the dot.
On the dot.
Got to have that fence finished by nightfall, rain or shine.
It'll be done.
Ok.
Mr. Northrup.
Come on, pud.
Let's get inside and see what Marcia's got for lunch.
Come in.
Come in, Dr. Evans.
They've gone to lunch.
Just as well.
Miss Riffle, what is this mystery?
I'm a busy man, miss Riffle.
I appreciate that,
Dr. Evans, but this is urgent.
An hour ago,
I happened to be passing, and I saw all these pieces of fence being unloaded.
Naturally,
I came back to find out what was going on.
I did find out, and I telephoned you immediately.
You are Julian's lawyer,
Mr. Pilbeam, and I want you and Dr. Evans to meet a friend of his, a Mr. Brink.
All right, where is he?
Just at the moment, he's up the apple tree.
Where?
Right up in that apple tree.
I don't see anyone up there.
Oh, you can't see him.
He's invisible.
What?
He's invisible.
You see, Betty, the old dog, barked at him.
Mr. Brink didn't like that, so he became invisible, and right after that,
Betty touched the tree and dropped over dead.
Is this supposed to be a joke, miss Riffle?
What would you say if I told you
I believed it was the gospel truth?
Frankly, I'd say you were crazy.
And if I told you I believed that anyone who touched that tree would die?
I'd say you were positively nuts, miss Riffle.
Well, I don't believe it, but Julian does.
Ho ho ho!
I'll be frank with you,
Mr. Pilbeam.
I intend to take that child away from this insane man's house before something terrible happens.
Tonight if possible.
Let's see what's going on out here.
By jiminy, what in tarnation are you doing back here?
Well, Julian...
Finn and Evans, too.
By golly, you've told them, haven't you?
No, Julian, I haven't.
Yes, she told us about Mr., uh, Brink?
I might have known it.
Well, now, Northrup, what's the answer?
It's the truth, Evans, just as sure as I'm here.
You mean there's somebody sitting up in that tree?
Yep. Mr. Brink.
Well, I might as well tell you all about it right now.
Nobody can't die no more until I say so...
Unless they touch that tree or them apples or Mr. Brink himself.
You're not serious about this, Northrup?
Of course he is, doctor.
What are you driving at, anyway?
I'm just interested, Julian.
Look here, Northrup...
Can you talk to this Mr. Brink?
Oh, sure, I can.
Can you talk to him now, Julian?
Why? Oh, you mean so you can hear him?
Well, I thought perhaps if you tried to talk to him now, you'd find out he isn't up there anymore.
Do try and make him talk.
I'd love to hear him.
Oh, you would?
Yes.
Well, by golly,
I'll let you all hear him.
Hey, can you hear me,
Mr. Brink?
Sir?
Huh. See?
Calls me sir.
He thinks someone's answering.
Come here, you.
Julian!
Just a minute, now.
Just a minute.
I'm going to settle this question about you getting pud and his money once and for all.
Can you see this old battle-ax,
Mr. Brink?
Her name is Demetria Riffle.
You got anything on your schedule about when you're supposed to snuff her out?
Riffle?
Riffle, Riffle, Riffle...
No such name's come to my attention as yet.
Oh. That's...
Well, I'm going to keep you up there until it's time to exterminate her.
Well, since you and your tree are so tenacious,
I shall have to sit here and wait for miss Riffle's call.
Oh, think you can hold out that long?
My dear man, a human life is like the twinkling of an eye to me.
Well, thank you,
Mr. Brink.
Well?
There you are.
I'm sorry for you,
Julian. Really, I am.
Why?
I didn't hear this thing in the tree say anything.
You didn't? Well...
You did, didn't you, Finn?
I'm sorry, Julian.
I didn't.
You?
No, Northrup, I didn't.
Say, what in the dickens is the matter with me anyway?
Am I going nuts?
Oh, it's probably some sort of a dream or something, Northrup.
You'll get over it in a few weeks and be all right again.
Well, did... didn't none of you hear him say nothing?
He said a human life was like the twinkling of an eye to him.
Ye gods, that's just what he said!
Ha ha!
See what he's doing to the boy?
Well, you see where that leaves you standing?
Northrup, I want to show you something.
What... are you going to do?
I'm going to eat an apple for you.
Hey, wait a minute!
Come here!
Why, you gol darn fool!
After all I've told you!
If you make one more move toward that tree,
I'll brain you!
Aah! He's dangerous!
All right, all right, Northrup.
Let me up...
And I won't go near the tree.
Trying to commit suicide.
All right, Northrup.
I just wanted to make sure you weren't joking.
Are you going to be home this evening, Northrup?
Huh! Where else would I be?
Of course I'll be home.
I may come in, and we'll talk this thing over.
Well, sure, come in.
Thanks.
I must go.
Yes, I...
I'm sorry I had to be so rough with you.
Oh, that's all right, Northrup.
Say, doc, you needn't worry about any of your patients dying yet awhile.
No! Ha ha ha!
Gramp, why can't they hear Mr. Brink?
Oh, I don't know, Sonny.
Guess they're too busy, that's all.
Oh, my dear man, that isn't the reason at all.
Look, Gramp, look.
Hello, Mr. Brink.
Well, how is it that only pud and me can hear you, then?
I have neither the inclination nor the authority to dispense information relevant to your inquiry.
Whew!
He still talks funny.
Yeah.
Did you notice the storm last night?
Yes.
Did you get wet?
No.
Do you mind the rain?
Oh, I love the rain.
I like sad things.
Do you enjoy eternity, Mr. Brink?
Oh, one gets used to it.
I suppose if I'm to
Usher you into eternity,
I should make it sound attractive.
Oh, no, no, no.
All I need's someplace near miss Nellie and Susan and Jim, someplace I can fix up a mite while I'm waiting for pud here to come along.
That is, if it needs any improvement.
Well, how about improvements?
The improvements are in the individual.
Oh, I don't think I'd like that.
I can't stand these holier-than-thou folks.
If a man's a good republican or a Mason or an elk, that's good enough for me.
Live and let live... that's my motto.
You can hardly expect me to second that.
Lunch is ready,
Mr. Northrup.
All right, Marcy.
I'll be right with you.
Hey!
Say good-bye to Mr. Brink.
Bye, Brink.
Oh, can't you say
Mr. Brink?
Bye, Mr. Brink.
Excuse me.
That's quite all right.
Bye, pud.
So long, Mr. Brink.
Now, I'll stay in the car, doctor, till you and Mr. Grimes bring Julian out.
Then I'll go in and dress pud, take him home with me.
I'll take over the house tomorrow.
You won't want that straitjacket, Grimes.
Better have it along in case he kicks up a row.
Yes, you better.
Rubbish. An old man in a wheelchair.
As a favor to me, don't take it in.
Ok, doc.
Mr. Northrup, Dr. Evans and a gentleman to see you.
All right, Marcy.
Be right along.
Thank you, Marcy.
You're welcome, doctor.
Good night, Gramps, bet I sleep like a top tonight, Gramps!
Yeah, I bet you do, son.
Good night, Gramps!
Good night, boy.
Well, good evening, gentlemen.
This is Mr. Grimes,
Mr. Northrup, a friend of mine.
I'm glad to meet you,
Mr. Grimes.
Yeah.
Sit down, Evans.
Sit down, Mr. Grimes.
Have a nip.
Oh, we haven't time for that,
Northrup...
I've been telling
Mr. Grimes about Mr. Brink and the tree.
What did you go and do that for?
Well, he's very interested.
I bet you don't believe he's up there.
Oh, sure, sure.
I believe it.
I was just going to ask you to come along with me and talk it over.
There's another fellow I'd like to have you meet who wants to hear about it.
Well, now, you see, it's this way, Mr. Grimes.
I don't want no more people to know about it than does already.
You see, it's hard for people to believe.
Now, it ain't everybody can hear Mr. Brink when he talks.
I figured... oh, what's the use?
Now, look here.
Try to get this straight, will you?
I'm taking you to the state insane asylum.
Jiminy.
Evans, where's demmy?
She's outside in the car.
Waiting...
Waiting for pud.
It's just for observation,
Northrup.
She'll take care of pud until you get back.
Sure. Now, you just come along with me and do as you're told, and you may get better soon and come home again.
But there ain't nothing the matter with me,
Mr. Grimes.
Then we'll find that out.
But honest, there ain't nothing the matter with me.
Now, look here, are you going to come along like a good man, or do I have to put a jacket on you?
Well... i guess it looks like I got to, don't it?
That's right.
Well, all right,
I'll go right along with you.
I'll say good night to pud.
That won't be necessary.
You can see him tomorrow.
She'll bring him up to the asylum.
Come on, now, Northrup, you might as well come along.
Let's get going now.
All right, I'll march right up to that bughouse and surprise them.
That's right.
You surprise them.
Good idea.
That's it.
My badge.
Uh, you know, the thing I wear in the parades.
I'm a veteran, you know.
Yes, fine.
You couldn't march without your badge, now, could you?
Oh, no sirree.
Yes.
No, sir.
No, sir.
Oh, I thought maybe it was upstairs.
Sometimes the best way is to humor them.
Now!
Put down that gun!
Put that thing down!
Ha ha!
Since you both made up your minds
I'm crazy, you must realize it will drive me wild if you don't humor me.
Careful, Northrup.
You're going to get into trouble, and this is no way of getting out of it.
It's the only way
I could think of at the moment.
Get your hands out of your pockets there!
Stay where you are!
Now, listen, Northrup... no. You can't convince me
I'm crazy.
I got to convince you I ain't, and I got to prove that what I been saying about Mr. Brink ain't a lot of poppycock.
You can convince us later.
Wait a minute!
Uh, Evans, you got enough poison in that kit of yours to kill a fly?
What's a fly got to do with it,
Northrup?
I'm going to make a bargain with you.
You take the worst poison you've got and put it into one of them wineglasses.
Then you take a fly and put him into it, and if that fly dies, I'll go along with you.
Hey!
Mr. Grimes...
Kindly catch a fly.
A bet ain't a bet that don't cut both ways!
If that fly lives, you got to swear
I'm sane.
Well, I don't know about that.
Don't worry. Don't worry.
I know darn well
I can kill a fly.
No, you can't.
All right, it's had time enough.
Huh.
Looks kind of sick, don't it?
Never saw anything deader.
He's dead, Northrup.
Now, wait a minute.
Give this fly a chance to come to.
All right, Northrup.
Well, I'll be jiggered.
Come on.
Put down that gun.
Yes, put it down.
Well, a bet's a bet, I suppose.
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!
He moved.
By golly, he's drunk.
Well, I'll be.
You didn't give him enough poison, doc.
I gave him enough to kill a million flies.
Now are you going to believe what I told you about Mr. Brink?
To blazes with that drivel!
Wait a minute!
You agreed to it!
Put that down now!
You promised him, Grimes.
What's a promise to a lunatic?
Oh, so you don't believe it yet, huh?
Step out, Grimes.
Get out of the way, Evans.
Get out of the way.
So you ain't going to keep your word, huh?
I know another way of proving what I say.
Northrup!
He's crazy!
He's dangerous!
At this close range, if I was to shoot a man right through the belly, he'd die, wouldn't he?
Good heavens, man!
Well, wouldn't he?
Well, of course he would!
Now that's what I'm asking you.
Ah, don't worry, doc.
He ain't going to die.
Crazy fool, he'll be dead in an hour.
We'll have to rush him to the hospital right away!
Stay up there,
Mr. Brink.
If you come down now, by golly,
I'm in the devil of a fix.
Pulse... normal.
Hello, doc. Say, where in thunder am I?
How do you feel?
Got a kind of a stomachache.
I think I need some food.
Stomachache? man, you ought to be dead.
Doctor?
Yes?
What's the death rate been in your hospital for the past 24 hours?
No deaths, oddly enough.
We've had 3 patients hanging on the Brink, but they're holding their own, holding their own.
Hello.
Hello up there.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello! Oh.
Sorry, Pilbeam.
Feeling all right?
Yes, of course.
Why?
Oh, I just wondered.
What do you want to speak to me about?
You got me out of bed.
Thought I might need you.
Oh.
Hear you didn't lock
Julian up last night.
He isn't crazy.
Oh.
Whatcha got here?
Fishing pole.
Going fishing?
Been fishing.
Catch much?
That's a mouse.
Yeah, it's a mouse.
What's the matter with you, Evans?
Now, don't get excited.
We've got to keep our heads.
Northrup shot Grimes last night...
Right through the belly.
Good heavens. Why?
He was experimenting.
Experimenting?
Now, wait a minute.
Grimes is all right.
All right?
According to what
I know about medicine,
Grimes should have died last night.
But he didn't.
Lots of things should have died last night...
But they didn't.
I was up all night experimenting with anything
I could get my hands on, but I couldn't kill a thing.
Except that mouse.
You know how I killed him?
I tied it to the end of that pole and touched it to that tree.
Ah, good morning, Evans!
Good morning, Finn!
Hello, Julian.
Hello.
Well, you fellows are up kind of early, ain't you?
How is my friend
Mr. Grimes today?
He seems to be doing all right.
Oh, well, I'm glad to hear that.
Kind of a nasty accident, wasn't it?
Sit down.
I owe you an apology, Northrup.
No, you don't.
I wouldn't have no respect for a man who'd believe a thing like that right off.
Sit down, Finn.
Sit down.
It's kind of interesting, though, ain't it?
Why, yes.
He's an awful nice fellow... Mr. Brink.
So friendly.
Thank you very much.
Oh, ho!
Good morning,
Mr. Brink.
I didn't know you was up yet.
Say, Marcia's making some coffee for us.
Would you like a cup?
No, thanks.
I've just had an apple.
Hee hee hee!
He's full of fun, too.
I've had a lovely morning.
I've had a mouse in my face.
Go along.
Say, Evans, what's this about Mr. Brink having a mouse thrown in his face?
Good heavens, Julian!
How do you know that?
Mr. Brink just told me.
Good heavens, I've got to go.
No, don't go, Pilbeam.
Got to get to the office.
Work to do.
Good-bye, Julian.
Good-bye, Evans. Good-bye... he looks all shot to pieces, don't he?
Huh? Oh.
Say, breakfast will be ready in a minute.
Why don't you stay and have some with pud and me.
I can't.
Thank you all the same.
Northrup...
Huh?
You've got to let him down.
It's no use, Evans.
You know what this is going to mean to the world...
To people suffering incurably...
The blessed release of death?
I am sorry, Evans, and I'm sorry for them people, too, but I got pud to look after.
What's going to happen,
Northrup, in the next few days when people find out there's no more death?
Think of it, man.
No more death.
Have you ever seen a man over 100 years old?
Sure, uh...
Fred brown's father.
Poor old fellow.
Just... well, what are you driving at?
By the time pud's a young man, you'll be getting to be that age yourself.
You've got to let him down, Northrup.
Well, I wouldn't like to become a nuisance to pud.
You've got to let
Mr. Brink down today.
I warn you, Julian.
I'm going to do everything in my power to make you.
I must!
Think it over.
I'll see you later.
And thank you for not letting me eat that apple yesterday.
You can have one now, if you want.
No, thanks.
Good-bye, Northrup, and I'm sorry.
Good-bye.
Now, Mr. Brink...
If I let you down, you're bound and determined to take me, ain't you?
You will be the first.
That's what I thought.
Guess there's no way out of that.
None.
Nope, I didn't think there was.
I wonder if Evans is right about pud and me, about my becoming a nuisance to the boy.
My dear man, there's no doubt about it.
Here she comes!
Here she comes!
Ding ding ding!
I love you, Gramps.
I love you more than my engine.
Dr. James Evans having testified that the said
Julian Northrup is incapable of managing himself and his property, it is the order of this court that he be committed to the gainesville institution for the insane, according to the laws of the state, and it is further ordered that the custody of the child,
John Gilbert Northrup, be awarded to his aunt Demetria Riffle... thank you, sir, thank you.
Well, Evans, you fixed me up good and proper, didn't you?
I warned you I'd do everything I could.
Come now, pud, you're to come home with me now.
Gramp!
Well, come along, Northrup.
Just a minute, sheriff.
I'd like to speak to pud first.
Please, Demetria.
Well, Evans...
You're a pretty smart fellow, ain't you?
And that I'll let
Mr. Brink down instead.
I'm hoping you will.
You're a pretty smart fellow.
What's the matter with Dr. Evans, Gramp?
Oh, I don't know.
I guess he's kind of sorry.
What's he sorry for?
Pud, I'm going away.
Where, Gramp?
Where the woodbine twineth.
You're going with Mr. Brink?
Mm-hmm.
I'm going with Mr. Brink.
You see, your Gramps has got to be a pretty old man, and when you get to be a pretty old man, you get kind of tired.
Are you tired?
Yes, pud. At this minute, I'm pretty gol darn tired.
Let's lay down and rest.
Well, that's what
I'm going to do, pud, but the only way for an old man to really lie down and rest is to go with Mr. Brink.
I'll go with you, Gramp.
Oh, no, Sonny.
You can't do that.
You got your whole life ahead of you.
Don't want my whole life ahead of me.
I want to go with you.
I love you, Gramps.
Now, now.
You shouldn't love me that much, son.
Maybe... maybe it ain't right for you to be living here with me anymore, pud.
Maybe your aunt Demetria ain't as much of a pismire as we thought she was.
Gramp.
No, no, now, that's right, Sonny, maybe she ain't, and maybe it would be better for you to go and live with her.
Don't... don't you love me anymore, Gramp?
Why, boy, I'm only trying to make you understand.
Gramp, you don't love me anymore.
Of course I do, boy, but I got to go away.
But I'll go with you, Gramp.
No, no, you can't, son, you can't.
Please, Gramp, please.
No.
Then I don't love you anymore either.
I don't love you anymore either!
I don't love you anymore either!
Pud!
Pud, come here, pud!
Pud, come here, boy!
Pud!
Where are you, boy?
Pud!
He will forget.
Ahh...
Maybe so.
There he is.
Come along now, Northrup.
Why, sheriff,
I ain't going with you.
I'm going with Mr. Brink.
Didn't Dr. Evans tell you about
Mr. Brink?
Yeah, he did.
Well, get it over with.
You and me's got to be on our way.
Take it easy, sheriff.
Northrup, would you rather we left you alone?
No. As a matter of fact, I'd rather have someone around.
Demmy.
Yes, Julian.
Will you promise me you'll be kind to pud?
Of course I will.
See that he gets some fun out of life?
He'll have his play period of course, but now he'll have education, too.
I shall begin to form his mind.
Why, his mind is forming all right as it is.
I'll teach him little poems to recite, how to say "yes, sir" and "no, sir," and how to curtsy... curtsy? Pud?
When miss roicroft's school opens... roicroft?! that's a girls' school.
Yes, Julian, but she's agreed to take pud if he's refined.
Oh, she has, has she?
Ah, you're still a pismire!
Going to make a sissy out of pud!
Ohh!
Well, there ain't nothing
I can do about it.
Good-bye, Marcy.
Will you keep an eye on pud?
Yes, Mr. Northrup.
Well, Mr. Brink, if you remember, the only reason
I got you up in that tree was to keep Demetria from getting the boy.
I've taken that into consideration.
Hey, get away from there!
Go away!
Get away from there!
See that bird?
It was singing.
It touched the tree...
Yes, it's dead.
So what of it?
Say, Mr. Brink,
I don't expect you got no news yet about when you're to take Demetria.
No, there's been no call for miss Riffle.
What's that?
You were supposed to take her an hour ago?
No, no, I said I wouldn't take her for years.
Well, by golly, why didn't you tell me that before?
If you were supposed to take her... but I'm not supposed to take her.
Northrup, did he really say that?
Yup! That changes everything.
Come on, demmy!
No, Julian!
This is absurd!
Dr. Evans! Dr. Evans!
I'm sorry, miss Riffle, but when a person's time comes...
But there isn't really anything in that tree.
Say, what goes on?
I wonder if you'd mind taking the sheriff for good measure.
What in blazes... good heavens,
Northrup, this is practically murder.
Listen, all of you!
Northrup's as sane as any of you.
Sane! Hey, what is this anyway?
Death is up that tree.
Northrup's talking to him.
If he lets him down, you're as good as dead, both of you.
I don't believe it.
This is ridiculous!
Shh! He's speaking!
This is the wildest absurdity I ever heard.
You know perfectly well that I have no authority to take any of these people.
What's that?
You're going to take the sheriff, too?
Thank you, Mr. Brink,
I appreciate that.
I don't believe it.
You can't frighten me.
I didn't hear a blessed thing up in that tree.
Me, neither.
I did.
I heard him.
You didn't!
I did! I heard Mr. Brink just as plain as I hear you, and he said if he could just come down, he'd take anyone
Mr. Northrup asked him to.
You can't scare me!
She can't hear a word I say!
She's the most inordinate liar
I ever met!
That's exactly what he said!
Come on, let's get started.
No use making him any angrier.
Come on, demmy!
Come on, sheriff!
Line up!
Here we go off to glory.
Sing, demmy!
# Glory, glory, hall... #
Sing, sheriff!
Let me down!
Stop it, Northrup!
We'll do anything you ask!
Look, Northrup, look!
All right!
I'm resigning my office tomorrow.
The democrats can have it for all of me.
Will you let my boy alone?
Julian, I will.
Will you get the tarnation away from me, too?
The tarnation away from you, too, Julian.
Then clear out of here, the lot of you!
I'm going to stay here and look after pud.
I don't care what becomes of the rest of the world.
Get off of my property!
If you ask me, you're getting off mighty easy.
I'm sorry, Evans, but I'm keeping him up in that tree.
Now, Marcy, ain't no need to cry.
What you done was fine, and I love you for it.
That's all right,
Mr. Northrup.
I'm glad they believed it.
We're all going to be happy now.
Wait till I tell pud!
Oh, pud!
Well... come on, Marcy, he may have gone back in the house.
Help me find him.
Yes, sir.
Oh, pud!
Oh, pud!
Pud!
Hey, Marcy!
Oh, bill, didn't any of the neighbors see him?
Nobody's seen him.
Ohh.
You go and look through the woods down there.
I'll go down to the creek.
Maybe he's fallen asleep in the boat.
Yes, sir. All right.
Oh, pud!
Pud.
Hi, Mr. Brink.
What's the matter?
Gramp doesn't love me anymore.
He doesn't?
No.
Didn't you follow the conversation?
Yes. What are you going to do?
I'm going to run away.
Then he'll be sorry.
Oh, I wouldn't do that.
You're not big enough to run away, my little man.
I am so.
And I'm not your little man.
I'm not a little man at all.
I'll spit in your eye.
You'd find that rather difficult.
Why?
I'm afraid you couldn't reach me.
I could, too.
You'd be afraid.
I'm not afraid of the biggest giant on earth.
How do you know that I...
That I'm not the biggest giant on earth?
I don't care a hoot if you are.
You're not very polite.
I'm politer than you are, you big squashapashosapuss.
I never heard that word before.
Neither did I.
You can make up words?
Sure. I can do anything.
No, you can't.
You can't even climb this tree.
I can, too.
I climbed that tree before you got up it.
And I climbed down again.
That's more than you can do.
But you couldn't do it now.
You couldn't even climb this fence.
I could do it with one hand.
Let's see.
All right.
Ouch!
Splinters hurt my hand.
I'll have to get myself a piece of tape.
Baby calf, baby calf.
Who's a baby calf?
That's right.
You're stronger than I thought.
Come on now, just a little more.
Careful.
Get one leg over.
That's right.
Splendid.
I guess you can do anything.
Golly. I can see far up here.
Can you see me now?
Yes.
Gee, why do you make your voice so whispery,
Mr. Brink?
Don't you like it?
Uh-huh.
I'm as high up as you are now.
Look at me.
Gee, you've got funny eyes, Mr. Brink.
They make me dizzy.
Look at me again.
That's right.
Keep on looking.
Come now.
Give me your hand.
Lean forward.
Gramp! Aah! Aah!
How is he?
He'll never be able to walk again, bill.
The specialist said he couldn't understand how he was still living.
Oh, bill.
Gramp.
Yes, pud.
Gramp!
Mr. Brink.
Yes.
Why did you let him do it?
I didn't mean to hurt him.
I only meant to take him.
He was my only hope of getting down from here.
He's in such terrible pain.
Think of the pain he will miss.
Now you understand how much it means to your whole world to deny me.
I guess I've tried to bite off more than I could chew.
Much more.
Mr. Brink, will you please come down and take us both?
Gladly.
No. You are first.
There.
That's better, isn't it?
I...
Yes.
He was quite a load at first.
Now he's light as a feather.
Here.
Hello, Mr. Brink.
Hello, pud.
Gramps, you're walking!
By golly, so I am, son.
Why didn't you tell me it was going to be like this, Mr. Brink?
My dear man, I've been trying to tell you how pleasant it is to go with me, but you wouldn't listen to me.
You talk so funny,
Mr. Brink.
Never mind me.
Come on now.
Come along.
Where are we going, Gramp?
Yes, that's important.
Where are we going?
You'll find out.
Look, Gramp!
Gee, it smells good here, Gramp.
That's the woodbine, Sonny.
How long are we going to be here,
Mr. Brink?
For eternity.
How long is eternity, Gramp?
That's a right smart piece of time, boy.
Anyway, we'll be together, won't we, Gramp?
You're darn tootin' we will, boy.
You're darn tootin'...
Julian!
Julian!
Do you have to use such language in front of the boy?
It's granny!
We're coming, granny!
Say, Mr. Brink,
I thought you told me she'd changed.
Coming, miss Nellie!
Coming!
Coming, grandma!
Call off your ungodly dogs!
Down!
Quiet! Down!
Are you Mr. Heathcliff?
Well, I'm Mr. Lockwood, your new tenant at the Grange.
I'm lost. I--
Can I get a guide from amongst your lads?
No, you cannot. I've only got one, and he's needed here.
Well, then, I'll have to stay till morning.
Do as you please.
Quiet! Down!
Thank you for your hospitality.
Could you extend it to a cup of tea?
- Shall I?
- You heard him ask for it.
Thank you.
I presume the amiable lady is Mrs. Heathcliff?
Would it be taxing your remarkable hospitality if I sat down?
I hope my hospitality will teach you... not to make rash journeys on these moors.
As for staying here, I don't keep accommodations for visitors.
You can share a bed with one of the servants.
Thanks. I'll sleep in a chair, sir.
No. A stranger is a stranger.
Guests are so rare in this house that I hardly know how to receive them.
I and my dog.
Joseph, open up one of the upstairs rooms.
Here's a room for thee, sir.
Bridal chamber.
Nobody slept here for years.
It's a trifle depressing.
- Can you light a fire?
- No fire will burn in yonder grate.
Chimbley's all blocked up.
Very well. Thanks.
Good night.
I said good night.
Heathcliff!
Let me in!
I'm lost on the moors!
- It's Cathy!
- Help! Mr. Heathcliff!
There's somebody out!
Oh, Mr. Heathcliff!
There's someone out there.
It's a woman. I heard her calling.
She said her name.
Cathy. That was it!
Cathy?
Oh, I must have been dreaming.
Forgive me.
Get out of this room.
Get out!
Get out, I tell you!
Cathy! Come in!
Cathy, come back to me.
Oh, do come once more.
Oh, my heart's darling!
Cathy. My own--
My--
Where's he going in the storm?
She calls him... and he follows her out onto the moor.
He's mad! He's like a madman.
He seized me by the collar and flung me out.
You see, I had a dream.
I thought I heard a voice calling.
I reached out to close the shutter, and something touched me.
Something cold and clinging, like an icy hand.
And then I saw her.
A woman.
Then my senses must have become disordered because the falling snow... shaped itself into what looked like a phantom, but there was nothing.
It was Cathy.
Who is Cathy?
A girl who died.
Oh, no, I don't believe in ghosts.
I don't believe in phantoms sobbing through the night.
- Poor Cathy.
- I don't believe life comes back... once it's died and calls again to the living.
No, I don't.
Maybe if I told you her story, you'd change your mind... about the dead coming back.
Maybe you'd know, as I do... that there is a force that brings them back... if their hearts were wild enough in life.
Tell me her story.
It began 40 years ago... when I was young... in the service of Mr. Earnshaw...
Cathy's father.
Cathy's father.
Wuthering Heights was a lovely place in those days... full of summertime and youth and happy voices.
One day Mr. Earnshaw was returning from a visit to Liverpool.
- You'll not catch me!
- Yes, I will!
Cathy, go wash! I don't want your father to see you in that dress.
You too, Hindley.
Hurry up, now.
I don't want to get washed!
Come along! I'll tell your father not to give you the present he's bringing.
- What's he bringing?
- Go along upstairs.
Joseph says his horse is coming over the hill.
Evening, Mr. Earnshaw.
- Hello, Joseph.
- Hello, neighbor Earnshaw.
- How are you, Dr. Kenneth?
- Back so soon?
What in the world have you got there?
A gift of God.
Although it's as dark as if he came from the devil.
- Quiet, me bonny lad, we're home.
- He's a dour-looking individual.
Aye, and with reason.
I found him starving in Liverpool... kicked and bruised and almost dead.
So you kidnapped him.
Not until I spent two pounds trying to find out who its owner was.
But nobody would claim him, so I brought him home.
- Giddap!
- Here, here!
Come on, you young imp of Satan.
Off with ye.
- Cathy, Hindley!
- Welcome home. The children are coming.
Don't look so shocked, Ellen.
He's going to live with us for a while.
Give him a good scrubbing... and put some Christian clothes on him.
Food is what he needs most,
Mr. Earnshaw.
He's as thin as a sparrow.
Come into the kitchen, child.
Cathy! Hindley!
- Father, what did you bring me?
- Hello, Father!
There you are.
It's what you've always wanted.
A riding crop.
Be careful how you use it.
- Oh, it's wonderful!
- I'm so glad you got back soon.
- It's wonderful!
- Ow! Father, make her stop!
No, children.
This is Hindley's violin.
One of the best in Liverpool.
Here. Fine tone.
And a bow to go with it.
Here you are, Paganini.
Who's that?
- He was hungry as a wolf.
- Oh, children.
This is a little gentleman I met in Liverpool who will pay us a visit.
He-- He's dirty.
Oh, no. Don't make me ashamed of you, Cathy.
When he's been scrubbed, show him Hindley's room.
- He'll sleep there.
- In my room?
He can't. I won't let him.
Children, you may as well learn now that you must share what you have... with others not as fortunate as yourselves.
- Take charge of the lad, Ellen.
- Come along, child.
What's your name?
We'll call him Heathcliff.
Heathcliff, I'll race you to the barn.
The loser has to be the slave.
Come on!
Faster!
Come on!
Whoa. I won!
You're my slave! You have to do as I say. Water my horse and groom it!
Oh, that's not fair!
It's too real.
- What do you want?
- This horse.
- You can't have him. He's mine!
- Mine's lame. I'm riding yours.
Give him to me or I'll tell Father you boasted you'd turn me out when he died!
That's a lie!
I never said such a thing.
- He didn't!
- You never had a father!
You gypsy beggar!
You can't have mine!
Stop that!
- Heathcliff, look out!
- Don't come near me!
Let him go!
You killed him!
I'm going to tell Father.
He'll punish you for this.
You can't go near him till he's well.
- You heard Dr. Kenneth!
- Are you hurt badly?
Talk to me.
Why don't you cry?
Heathcliff, don't look like that!
How can I pay him back?
I don't care how long I wait... if I can only pay him back.
Come. Let's pick harebells on Penistone Crag.
You can ride Jane.
Please, milord?
- Oh, Heathcliff.
- Whoa, Jane.
- You're so handsome when you smile.
- Don't make fun of me.
Don't you know that you're handsome?
Do you know what I've told Ellen?
- You're a prince in disguise.
- You did?
I said your father was the emperor of
China and your mother an Indian queen.
It's true, Heathcliff.
You were kidnapped by wicked sailors and brought to England.
But I'm glad. I've always wanted to know somebody of noble birth.
All the princes I ever read about had castles.
Of course. They captured them.
You must capture one too.
There's a beautiful castle that lies waiting for your lance, Sir Prince.
You mean Penistone Crag?
Aw, that's just a rock.
If you can't see that's a castle, you'll never be a prince.
Here, take your lance and charge!
See that black knight at the drawbridge?
Challenge him!
Charge!
I challenge you to mortal combat,
Black Knight!
Heathcliff! You've killed him!
You've killed the black knight!
He's earned it for all his wicked deeds.
Oh, it's a wonderful castle.
- Heathcliff, let's never leave it.
- Never in our lives!
Let all the world confess, there is not a more beautiful damsel... than the Princess Catherine of Yorkshire.
But I'm still your slave.
No, Cathy.
I now make you my queen.
Whatever happens out there, here you will always be my queen.
How is he, Doctor?
He is at peace.
Send for the vicar, Joseph.
My dear, wild little Cathy.
You may come up and pray beside him now.
You're not wanted up there.
My father is past your wheedling.
Go and help the stable boys harness the horse for the vicar.
Do as you're told.
I'm master here now.
And as the children grew up, Hindley was indeed master of Wuthering Heights.
It was no longer the happy home of their childhood.
- Joseph, bring me another bottle.
- That's the third, Mr. Hindley.
The third or the twenty-third, bring me another.
Wine is a mocker.
Strong drink is raging, Master Hindley.
Stop spouting scripture and do as you're told, you croaking old parrot.
Yes, Master Hindley.
Sit down, Cathy, till you're excused from the table.
Joseph, fill Miss Cathy's glass.
Oh, my little sister disapproves of drinking.
Well, I know some people who don't.
Heathcliff, saddle my horse.
Be quick about it, you gypsy beggar.
I told you to be quick.
Look at this stable. It's a pigsty.
Is this the way you do your work?
Clean it up. I want this floor cleaned and scrubbed tonight.
Don't stand there showing your teeth.
Give me a hand up.
I want your work done when I come back at dawn, do you hear?
Oh, you're hoping I won't come back.
You're hoping I'll fall and break my neck, aren't you?
Aren't you?
Well, come on, Heathcliff.
Heathcliff, where are you going?
Come back!
- Did Joseph see which way you came?
- What does it matter?
Nothing's real down there.
Our life is here.
Yes, milord.
The clouds are lowering over Gimmerton Head.
See how the light is changing?
It would be dreadful if Hindley ever found out.
Found out what?
That you talk to me once in a while?
I shouldn't talk to you at all.
Look at you!
You get worse every day.
Dirty and unkempt and in rags.
Why aren't you a man?
Heathcliff, why don't you run away?
Run away? From you?
You could come back rich and take me away.
Why aren't you my prince like we said long ago?
- Why can't you rescue me?
- Come with me now.
- Where?
- Anywhere!
And live in haystacks and steal our food from the marketplaces?
No. That's not what I want.
You just want to send me off.
That won't do.
I've stayed here and been beaten like a dog.
Abused and cursed and driven mad, but I stayed just to be near you.
Even as a dog! I'll stay till the end.
I'll live and I'll die under this rock.
Do you hear?
Music.
The Lintons are giving a party.
That's what I want.
Dancing and singing in a pretty world.
And I'm going to have it.
Come on. Let's go and see.
Come on!
Isn't it wonderful?
Isn't she beautiful?
That's the kind of dress I'll wear.
You'll have a red velvet coat with silver buckles on your shoes.
Oh, will we ever?
Quick.
- Hold him, Skulker, Flash!
- Call off your dogs, you fools!
Stay where you are.
There's nothing to be alarmed about.
- Who is it?
- I don't know.
Please, back into the ballroom.
- Let me go!
- Hold that man.
Hold onto him!
- Who is it Edgar?
- Catherine Earnshaw, Father.
- Who's this with her?
- Their stable boy.
She's bleeding. Bring hot water,
Isabella, and bandages.
- Yes. How badly is she hurt?
- Can't tell.
Send Robert to get Dr. Kenneth in the shay. Hurry.
- You'll pay for this!
- Hold your tongue, insolent rascal!
- Get out of this house.
- I won't go without Cathy.
Father, please, she's in pain.
Go on. Run away.
Bring me back the world.
- Pack this fellow off.
- I'm going.
I'm going from here and from this cursed country both.
Throw him out!
But I'll be back in this house one day,
Judge Linton. I'll pay you out.
I'll bring this house down in ruins about your heads.
That's my curse on you!
On all of you!
And so Cathy found herself in this new world... she had so often longed to enter.
After some happy weeks, Mr. Edgar brought her back to Wuthering Heights.
Welcome home, Miss Cathy!
How do you do, Mr. Linton?
Don't stir!
I'll get Joseph to carry you.
Carry her?
She runs like a little goat.
Ellen, I've been dancing, night after night!
Oh, how beautiful you look! Wherever did you get that beautiful dress?
Mr. Linton's sister lent it to me.
Isn't it wonderful?
Edgar, do come in for tea.
As soon as the horses have been seen to.
I'll find someone.
Is he here?
He came back last week with great talk... of lying in a lake of fire without you-- how he had to see you to live.
He's unbearable.
Where could he be, the scoundrel?
Why did you stay so long in that house?
I didn't expect to find you here.
Why did you stay so long?
Why? Because I was having a wonderful time.
A delightful, fascinating, wonderful time... among human beings.
Go and wash your face and hands, and comb your hair... so that I needn't be ashamed of you in front of a guest.
What are you doing in this part of the house? Look after Mr. Linton's horses.
Let him look after his own.
- I've already done so.
- Apologize to Mr. Linton at once.
Bring in some tea, please.
- Cathy.
- Yes, Edgar?
I cannot understand how your brother can allow that gypsy in the house.
Don't talk about him.
How can you, a gentlewoman, tolerate him under your roof?
A roadside beggar giving himself airs of equality. How can you?
What do you know about Heathcliff?
- All I need or want to know.
- He was my friend long before you.
- That blackguard?
- Blackguard and all, he belongs here.
Speak well of him or get out!
- Are you out of your senses?
- Stop calling those I love names!
Those you love?
Cathy, what possesses you?
Do you realize the things you're saying?
I'm saying that I hate you.
I hate the look of your milk-white face.
I hate the touch of your soft, foolish hands.
That gypsy's evil soul has got into you.
- Yes, it's true!
- That beggar's dirt is on you!
Yes! Now get out!
My dear.
Leave me alone.
Forgive me, Heathcliff.
Make the world stop right here.
Make everything stop and stand still and never move again.
Make the moors never change and you and I never change.
The moors and I will never change.
- Don't you, Cathy.
- I can't.
No matter what I ever do or say, this is me now.
Standing on this hill with you.
This is me forever.
Come.
When you went away, what did you do?
Where did you go?
I went to Liverpool.
One night I shipped for America on a brigantine going to New Orleans.
We were held up by the tide, and I lay all night on the deck... thinking of you and the years and years ahead without you.
I jumped overboard and swam ashore.
I think I'd have died if you hadn't.
You're not thinking of that other world now.
Smell the heather.
Fill my arms with heather.
All they can hold.
Come on.
You're still my queen!
And as time went by...
Cathy again was torn between her wild, uncontrollable passion for Heathcliff... and the new life she had found at the Grange... that she could not forget.
I got the soap in my eyes!
Where's the towel?
- Oh, it's hot!
- No, it's just--
- It's hot!
- Don't do that!
Ellen, haven't you finished yet?
Supposing you're not ready when he gets here. Keep still.
Any young man that will come sniveling back after the way you treated him... you can keep waiting forever.
What's wrong with him, sending you perfume? Hasn't he any pride?
I sent my apologies, didn't I?
I can't believe this change in you,
Miss Cathy.
Yesterday you were a harum-scarum child with dirty hands and a willful heart.
Look at you.
Oh, you're lovely, Miss Cathy.
Lovely.
That's a very silly lie.
I'm not lovely.
What I am is very brilliant.
- I have a wonderful brain.
- Indeed?
It enables me to be superior to myself.
There's nothing to be gained by just looking pretty like Isabella.
Every beauty mark must conceal a thought and every curl be full of humor... as well as brilliantine. as well as brilliantine.
Such prattle. We--
Since when are you in the habit of entering my room, Heathcliff?
I want to talk to you.
Go outside, Ellen.
I will not! I take orders from
Mistress Catherine, not stable boys.
Go outside.
All right, Ellen.
Now that we're so happily alone, may I know to what I owe this great honor?
- He's coming here again.
- You're utterly unbearable.
You didn't think so this morning on the moors.
- Well, my moods change indoors.
- Is he coming here?
- Of course not. Please go away.
- You're lying!
Why are you dressed up in a silk dress?
Because gentlefolk dress for dinner.
Not you. Why are you trying to win his puling flatteries?
I'm not a child.
You can't talk like that to me.
I'm not talking to a child.
I'm talking to my Cathy.
- Oh, I'm your Cathy?
- Yes!
I'm to take your orders and allow you to select my dresses?
You're not gonna simper in front of him, listening to his silly talk!
I'm not?
Well, I am. It's more entertaining that listening to a stable boy.
- Don't you talk like that.
- I will. Go away.
This is my room, a lady's room, not a room for servants with dirty hands.
Let me alone!
Yes.
Tell the dirty stable boy to let go of you.
He soils your pretty dress.
But who soils your heart?
Not Heathcliff!
Who turns you into a vain, cheap, worldly fool? Linton does!
You'll never love him, but you'll let yourself be loved to please your vanity.
Loved by that milksop with buckles on his shoes!
Stop it and get out!
You had your chance to be something else.
But thief or servant were all you were born to be, or beggar beside a road.
Not earning favors, but whimpering for them with your dirty hands!
That's all I've become to you: a pair of dirty hands.
Well, have them then!
Have them where they belong!
It doesn't help to strike you.
Good evening, Ellen.
I hope I'm not too early.
- Miss Cathy will be down in a minute.
- Thanks.
If you'll go into the parlor,
I'll tell Miss Cathy you're here.
Half past eight.
Unholy hour.
Doesn't he know, young fool, when it's time to go home?
That's Mr. Edgar now.
Go and fetch his horse.
- Take these apples into the larder.
- Yea, Lord.
Spare the righteous and smite the ungodly.
Stop your pratter.
- Good night, Joseph.
- Good night, sir.
Has he gone?
Your hands! What have you done?
Linton. Is he gone?
What have you done to your hands?
What have you been doing?
I want to crawl to her feet, whimper to be forgiven... for loving me, for needing her more than my own life... for belonging to her more than my own soul.
Don't let her see me.
I wondered whether you were still up.
I have some news!
The kitchen is no place for that.
Come into the parlor.
Come here.
Sit down. Listen!
Can you keep a secret?
Edgar's asked me to marry him.
- What did you tell him?
- That I'd give him my answer tomorrow.
Do you love him, Miss Cathy?
- Yes! Of course.
- Why?
Why? That's a silly question, isn't it?
No, not so silly.
Why do you love him?
He's handsome and pleasant to be with.
- That's not enough.
- Because he'll be rich someday.
I'll be the finest lady in the county.
Now tell me how you love him.
I love the ground under his feet, the air above his head... and everything he touches.
What about Heathcliff?
Oh, Heathcliff.
He gets worse every day.
It would degrade me to marry him.
I wish he hadn't come back.
It would be heaven to escape from this disorderly, comfortless place.
Well, if Master Edgar and his charms and money...
Well, if Master Edgar and his charms and money... and parties mean heaven to you... what's to keep you from taking your place among the Linton angels?
I don't think I belong in heaven.
I dreamt once I was there.
I dreamt I went to heaven, and it didn't seem to be my home.
I broke my heart with weeping to come back to earth.
The angels were so angry, they flung me out in the middle of the heath... on top of Wuthering Heights.
I woke up sobbing with joy.
That's it, Ellen!
I have no more business marrying Edgar than I have of being in heaven.
But Ellen, what can I do?
You're thinking of Heathcliff.
Who else?
He's sunk so low. He seems to take pleasure in being brutal.
And yet... he's more myself than I am.
Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same.
Linton's is as different as frost from fire.
My one thought in living is Heathcliff.
I am Heathcliff.
Everything he's suffered,
I've suffered.
The little happiness he's ever known,
I've had too.
If everything died and Heathcliff remained... life would still be full for me.
Hey, Heathcliff!
Where's thee going?
Heathcliff!
Come back!
He must have been listening.
- Listening to us?
- Yes.
Where?
How much did he hear?
I'm not sure, but I think... to where you said it would degrade you to marry him.
There's no use in calling.
He's run away on master's best horse.
Come out of this storm!
You'll catch your death of cold!
- He won't come back!
- Last time he did!
This time he won't.
I know him.
- Which way did he go, Joseph?
- Yonder. Right on west moor.
- Come in! You must come in.
- The fool.
He should have known
I love him. I love him!
Heathcliff, come back!
- Thank heaven you've come home!
- I told Joseph to stay awake!
- Do I unsaddle my own horse?
- You've got to go out again!
Miss Cathy's gone! They're looking for her-- Joseph, everybody!
- Gone where?
- Out in the storm, hours ago.
Heathcliff ran away. He took a horse, and she went running after him.
- Oh, she did?
- Yes.
Don't stand there with your mouth open.
Fetch me a bottle and we'll celebrate.
Master Hindley, she'll die on the moors.
- You've got to help.
- Do as I tell you!
If she's gone off with that gypsy scum, let her run.
Let her run through storm and hell.
They're birds of a feather.
The devil can take them both.
Get me a bottle.
- Take her into the library.
- Get a fire in the east room.
And some brandy.
Turn this around to the fire.
- The brandy, Miss Isabella.
- Get some dry towels. Quickly.
- Where was she?
- The rocks on Penistone Crag... the life almost out of her.
Twenty drops in a glass of claret, well warmed.
Then add a lump of sugar.
There's nothing else I can tell you... except keep her in the sun and give her plenty of cream and butter.
In another month you'll be feeling like new.
- Good-bye, dear.
- Good-bye, Dr. Kenneth.
She'll be going home soon, Doctor.
What's needed is peace and orderliness in her life.
That's not to be found at Wuthering Heights.
- Has she mentioned him at all?
- Not since the delirium passed.
Sometimes fever can heal as well as destroy.
I made some inquiries in the village of the people who knew him.
- What did you hear?
- No sign nor hint of Heathcliff.
- He's disappeared into thin air.
- Heaven hope.
"...days and yon pursuits."
- Hello, Edgar.
- Isabella. How's our invalid?
- Much better I think.
- Let me have a look at her.
Where have you been all day?
I've missed you.
Oh, this time of year every tenant has something to complain about.
I've been arguing with old Swithin... whether we'd build him a new pigsty.
Yes?
He decided we should.
I saw Hindley in the village this afternoon.
He wanted to know when you'll be coming home.
I wasn't very truthful. I told him
Dr. Kenneth said it would be months.
Give me that.
It's time for her medicine.
What did Dr. Kenneth say?
Twenty lumps of sugar in a glass--
No. I'll go and ask Ellen.
Yes. Go and ask Ellen.
She's such a darling.
But you've all been so nice to me.
That's all I think about, how nice you are to me.
But still, I can't stay here forever.
Why not, Cathy... if I can make you happy?
You have made me happy, Edgar.
You've given me so much of your own self, your strength.
Darling, let me take care of you forever.
Let me guard you and love you always.
Would you love me always?
Yes.
It's so easy to love you.
Because I'm no longer wild and blackhearted and full of gypsy ways?
- No. I--
- Of course you were right, Edgar.
What you said long ago was true.
There was a strange curse on me.
Something that kept me from being myself.
Or at least from being what I wanted to be-- living in heaven.
How sweet you are.
I've never kissed you.
No one will ever kiss me again but you.
No one.
I'll be your wife and be proud of being your wife.
I'll be good to you and love you truly, always.
White heather for good luck,
Miss Catherine.
Come along, Cathy.
What is it?
A cold wind went across my heart just then-- a feeling of doom.
You touched me, and it was gone.
Oh, it's nothing, darling,
I'm sure.
Oh, Edgar, I love you. I do.
Good-bye.
And I, too, felt a cold wind across my heart as they rode away together.
And I, too, felt a cold wind across my heart as they rode away together.
But as the years went on, they were really in possession... of a deep and growing happiness.
I wish you could've seen Miss Cathy then.
She became quite the lady of the manor and was almost overfond of Mr. Linton.
For Isabella, she showed great affection... and presided over Thrushcross Grange... with quiet dignity.
It looks as though you've fallen into a trap, Father.
Yes, it does, doesn't it?
There you are.
Checkmate.
- Thank you, Father.
- Well, I'll go and dress for dinner.
What's wrong with the dogs?
Probably a servant coming back from the village.
I talked to Jeff Peters this afternoon about that new wing of ours.
It doesn't look as though we'll marry Isabella off for another decade.
It's a brother's duty to introduce your sister to some other type... than fops and pale young poets.
- You want a dragoon?
- Yes, I do. With a fiery mustache.
Poor Isabella. I'm afraid I got the only prize in the county.
Thank you, darling.
For me, heaven is bounded... by the four walls of this room.
Yes, we're all angels, even my little petit point hero.
I'm just putting wings on him.
Speaking of wings,
I'll show you those plans.
- Miss Cathy?
- What is it?
Someone wishes to see you.
- You sound as if it were a ghost.
- It is. He's come back.
Who?
- What does he want?
- He wants to see you.
Tell him-- Tell him
I'm not at home.
Not at home, Cathy?
To whom are you not at home?
It's Heathcliff.
Seems he's come back.
Well, that's news.
Where has he been?
America, he said. He's so changed
I hardly recognized him.
- For the better, I hope.
- Oh, yes. He's quite the gentlemen.
- Fine clothes, a horse.
- Go tell him I don't wish to see him.
Oh, nonsense, Cathy.
We can't be as cruel as that.
He's come a long way, and he's a fine gentleman, so Ellen says.
Let's see how America's managed to make a silk purse out of Master Heathcliff.
- Show him in.
- Yes, Master Edgar.
It's chilly.
Why be nervous?
The past is dead.
It's nonsense to tremble before a little ghost who returns-- a dead leaf blowing around your feet.
Darling... you may smile at him without fear of offending me.
It's my wife who smiles-- my wife who loves me.
Yes.
I was silly.
Thank you, Edgar.
Well, Heathcliff.
- Mr. Linton.
- How are you?
Hello, Cathy.
- I remember this room.
- Come in. Sit by the fire.
Have a whiskey?
No, thank you.
I've never seen such a change in a man.
I wouldn't have known you.
You seem to have prospered since our last meeting.
Somewhat.
Ellen said you'd been to America.
Yes.
We all wondered where you went.
Have you met my sister, Miss Linton?
What brought about this amazing transformation?
Did you discover a gold mine in the New World... or inherit a fortune?
The truth is, I remembered that my father was an emperor of China... and my mother was an Indian queen... and I went out and claimed my inheritance.
It all turned out just as you once suspected, Cathy... that I had been kidnapped by wicked sailors and brought to England.
That I was of noble birth.
Are you visiting here long?
I mean, in the village?
The rest of my life.
I've just bought Wuthering Heights-- the house, the stock and the moors.
Hindley has sold you the estate?
He's not aware of it as yet.
I'm afraid it'll be somewhat of a surprise when he finds... his gambling debts and liquor bills paid off by his former stable boy.
Perhaps he will merely laugh at the irony of it.
I don't understand how this could've happened... without Mrs. Linton hearing of it.
Modesty compelled me to play the Good Samaritan in secret.
By heaven. This is the most underhanded piece of work I've ever heard of.
If I'd only known. I knew Hindley had financial difficulties... but not that his property was being stolen from him by a stranger.
I'm neither thief nor stranger.
Merely your neighbor, sir.
- Now I'll say good night.
- Wait, Heathcliff.
Edgar and I have many neighbors whom we receive with hospitality and friendship.
If you are to be one of them, you're welcome to visit our house... but not with a scowl on your face or an old bitterness in your heart.
Thank you.
It occurs to me that I have not congratulated you on your marriage.
I've often thought of it.
Allow me to express my delight over your happiness now.
Good night.
- I think you behaved abominably.
- What?
You, too, Cathy. I'm dreadfully disappointed in both of you.
- What are you talking about?
- You could have been civil to him.
I conducted myself perfectly, and so did Cathy.
- You dismissed him like a servant.
- And you thought him otherwise?
- I thought him distinguished.
- I hope I misunderstood you.
It's impossible my sister could think of Heathcliff... as anything but a surly, dressed-up beggar, a lout and a boor.
I shall make sure that you never see him again.
Now go to dinner.
Joseph.
Yes, Master Hindley?
- Where's the key?
- Is it in the door?
No, and I want it. He's left, and it's our chance. I'll lock him out this time.
If he tries to get in,
I'll kill him.
Find that key, and bring me a bottle of wine.
- You've had a bad night.
- A bad night, you call it?
How can I stay sober with that vulture's beak inside me?
He stabbed me in the dark.
He robbed me of my home and gold.
- Where's the wine?
- Dr. Kenneth has forbid it.
- Blast Dr. Kenneth!
- Get him what he wants.
Dr. Kenneth has forbid it.
What difference to the world whether he's drunk or sober?
Or to Dr. Kenneth?
Do as I tell you.
Get out.
It's too early in the morning to look on the devil.
Your ingratitude makes me almost sad.
All I have done to you is to enable you to be yourself.
My money has helped you drink and gamble and enjoy the world as you wished.
Now that you're without a home
I remember that you gave me... a place to sleep when you might've turned me out.
I allow you to remain... and even provide you with solace... against the doctor's orders.
I'll have Wuthering Heights back.
I'll be master here, and I'll turn you out as I should have done years ago.
We're just in time, Joseph.
Mr. Hindley is beginning to whine and stutter.
He needs fire in his veins-- a little courage with which to face his unhappy life.
I'll have my gold, and I'll have your blood, and hell can have your soul!
Laugh now, Heathcliff.
There's no laughter in hell.
All you have to do is to shoot.
They'll thank me for it.
The world will say I did right ridding it of a rotten gypsy beggar!
Yes! They'll say that.
Shoot, and you'll be master here again.
The whole county will resound with your courage.
Go on, shoot, you puling chicken of a man... with not enough blood in you to keep your hand steady!
You remember that time you hit me with a rock?
The times you shamed and flogged me as your stable boy?
You were a coward then, and you're a coward now.
Take him out.
Find someplace for him to sleep.
Aye. I'll put him to bed.
Not in the master's room.
I'm master here now.
- His pistol.
- Aye. I'll hide it.
A gentleman must not be deprived of his weapons.
I prefer that he have it by him always as a reminder of his cowardice.
- Master Heathcliff.
- What is it?
- A lady to see you.
- A lady? From where?
The Grange, sir.
The Grange?
Why didn't you tell me?
Out of my way.
I hope I'm not disturbing you.
Not at all.
I was riding behind the Heights on the moors, and my horse went lame.
- And you brought him here.
- Yes.
That was very wise.
Shall we look at the animal?
That isn't necessary.
I've put him in the stables.
He's being taken care of.
I see.
Won't you come in?
Get on with your work.
I was furious with my brother, and Cathy too. I told them so.
I thought they acted most shamefully.
Let me give you a chair.
Your brother didn't send you with these apologies?
Oh, no. He's forbidden me to--
To speak to me?
Yes.
And Mrs. Linton?
She's also very angry with you.
So in all the county you are my only friend.
I would like to be.
Well, let us celebrate our new friendship by a gallop over the moors.
Oh, but my horse is lame.
My dear, your horse is not lame, and it never was.
You came to see me because you are lonely... because it is lonely sitting like an outsider... in so happy a house as your brother's-- lonely riding on the moors with no one at your side.
You won't be lonely anymore.
Good evening, sir.
Good evening, Ellen.
I was afraid you wouldn't come. Tonight would've been ruined if you hadn't.
Good heavens.
Is that Heathcliff?
Yes, it is.
I can't believe it.
Cathy having him here--
Not Cathy. It's my sister.
It's just a young girl's fancy, but one must not inflame it... with too much opposition, but let it spend itself harmlessly in a few dances.
Madam Eilers is going to play the harpsichord. Come and sit down.
I shall let you hold my hand underneath my fan.
Thank you very much.
Oh, it's a waltz.
Heathcliff, will you?
You see, we can hold each other, and no one can object... because that's the way it's danced.
That's the way gypsies dance.
I'm surprised to see such abandoned ways creep into so fine a house.
Father used to say it'd undermine the whole of society... and turn us into profligates.
- May I have the pleasure?
- Thank you, but I don't think I can.
Nonsense. Let me see you waltz.
- Will you watch me?
- Of course.
I'm ready.
You're not dancing this dance.
Thank you. I'm nearly exhausted.
Will the moonlight and a breath of air refresh you?
Always.
Excuse me, please.
Are you enjoying yourself,
Heathcliff?
I've had the pleasure of watching you.
You're very grand, Heathcliff.
So handsome.
Looking at you tonight I could not help but remember how things used to be.
They used to be better.
Don't pretend life hasn't improved for you.
Life has ended for me.
How can you stand here beside me and pretend not to remember?
Not to know that my heart is breaking for you?
That your face is the wonderful light burning in all this darkness?
Heathcliff, no.
I forbid it.
You forbid what your heart says?
- It's saying nothing.
- I can hear it louder than the music.
Oh, Cathy.
I'm not the Cathy that was.
Can't you understand?
I'm somebody else. I'm another man's wife, and he loves me. And I love him.
If he loved you with all his soul for a lifetime... he couldn't love you as much as I do in a single day.
Not he. Not the world.
Not even you, Cathy, can come between us.
You must go away. You must leave this house and never come back.
I never want to see your face again as long as I live.
You lie.
Why do you think I'm here tonight?
Because you willed it.
You willed me here across the sea.
Cathy, have you seen Heathcliff?
Oh, there you are.
They're going to play a schottische.
Come along.
It's quite suitable to your high moral character.
What's the matter? Has Cathy been behaving horribly again?
If she weren't my sister-in-law,
I'd say she was jealous.
Come along.
Come in.
- I want to talk to you.
- What about, Cathy?
- About Heathcliff.
- It's very late.
I have no desire to discuss Heathcliff with you anyway.
- You behaved disgracefully tonight.
- In what way?
It was bad enough your asking him here, but to make a spectacle of yourself.
Catherine, be careful of what you say.
You fool. You vain little fool.
I'll not be silent any longer.
I'm going to tell the truth.
- Let me go.
- Not till I open your eyes.
My eyes are quite open, thank you.
Don't you see what he's doing?
He's using you to be near me... to smile at me behind your back... to try to rouse something in my heart that's dead.
I'll not have it.
I'll not allow you to help him.
It's you who are vain and insufferable.
- Heathcliff loves me.
- It's a lie.
It's not a lie. He's told me so.
He's kissed me.
He's held me in his arms.
He's told me that he loves me.
- I'm going to your brother.
- Go! He's asked me to marry him.
We're going to be married.
Heathcliff's going to be my husband.
You can't.
Heathcliff's not a man... but something dark and horrible to live with.
Do you imagine that I don't know why you're acting so?
Because you love him.
Yes! You love him! And you're mad with pain at the thought of my marrying him.
You want him to pine and dream of you... die for you, while you live in comfort as Mrs. Linton.
You don't want him to be happy.
You want to make him suffer.
You want to destroy him!
But I want to make him happy, and I will!
I heard your voices.
We were just discussing the ball.
There's plenty of time for gossip tomorrow.
You ought to come to bed, darling.
You look tired.
Good night.
- Good morning, Joseph.
- Mistress Cathy, I mean.
Mr. Hindley's away.
It's Mr. Heathcliff I wish to see.
Oh.
Oh, aye.
I'll try and find him.
Leave us, Joseph.
What brings you to Wuthering Heights?
Does Edgar know?
I doubt he'd approve.
Heathcliff, is it true?
- Is what true?
- That you asked Isabella to marry you.
It is true then.
Oh, Heathcliff, you must not do this.
She hasn't harmed you.
- You have.
- Then punish me!
I'm going to, when I take her in my arms-- when I promise her life and happiness.
If there's anything human left in you, don't do this.
Don't make me a partner to such a crime.
It's stupid. It's mad.
If you ever looked at me with what is in you, I'd be your slave.
If your heart were stronger than your fear of God and the world...
I would live silently contented in your shadow.
But no.
You must destroy us both with that weakness you call virtue.
You must keep me tormented with that cruelty you think so pious.
You've been smug and pleased with my vile love of you, haven't you?
After this, you won't think of me as
Cathy's foolish and despairing lover.
You'll think of me as Isabella's husband... and be glad for my happiness... as I was for yours.
- Drive to the village. Get Mr. Linton.
- Very well, ma'am.
Marry? It's preposterous.
Isabella and Heathcliff?
It's true.
What will you do about it?
Do? I'll put her under lock and key if need be.
- We must go after them.
- Going after them is useless.
We must go after them while there's still time. They mustn't marry.
Don't disturb yourself.
There's nothing I can do.
But you must, Edgar.
Get your pistols.
Go after them. Kill him!
But stop them from marrying.
This marriage cannot be, do you hear?
It must--
And so Heathcliff and Isabella were married.
Many months later at Wuthering Heights... during one of Dr. Kenneth's increasingly rare visits--
Why don't you hit yourself over the head with a hammer... the instant you get up in the morning?
- Why?
- If you hit yourself hard enough... you'll remain unconscious the whole day and achieve the same results... you would from a whole gallon of spirits... with much less wear and tear on the kidneys.
Don't you agree with me,
Mrs. Heathcliff?
What does it matter?
Well, I'd hoped that it did matter... that when you came here, things would change.
Only I changed.
I remember this house when it rang with laughter and love. Good-bye.
Ask your husband to call another doctor in future.
Whoever dwells in this house is beyond my healing arts.
I shall miss you, Dr. Kenneth.
I brought you into the world... but it's a world you're not going to grace very long if you stay here.
Dear child, I must tell you this.
Go back where you belong, back with Edgar for a month or two.
It would mean your salvation, and his.
Edgar's disowned me.
Nonsense. That was natural under the circumstances, but he needs you now.
He does. Why?
Cathy is gravely ill.
In fact, it's only a matter of days.
Hours, perhaps.
What is it?
Fever.
Inflammation of the lungs.
But there's something beyond that.
I don't know. I'd call it a will to die.
If Cathy died...
I might begin to live.
Begin to live, eh?
In this house with Heathcliff, nothing can live.
Nothing but hate. It's breathing like the devil's own breath on me.
And you, he hates you worse than he does me. He loathes you.
Each time you kiss him his heart breaks with rage because it's not Cathy.
- Kill him.
- I forbade you to speak about him.
- Stop it, you hear me?
- Kill him!
That's the first lucid talk I've heard out of Hindley for weeks.
It's not very Christian talk, but it's coherent.
Seemed to make some points.
- I'm delighted with your improvement.
- I tried to stop him.
Thank you, my dear wife.
Your loyalty is touching.
Your curses will come home to feed on your own heart.
Every agony you've given will return.
Why do we have him here?
I can't breathe with him in the house.
Existence would be so much less without my boyhood friend under my roof.
Don't you see?
You poison yourself with hating him.
Darling, please send him away and let love come into the house.
Why isn't there the smell of heather in your hair?
Why won't you let me come near you?
You're not black and horrible as they all think. You're full of pain.
I can make you happy. Let me try.
You won't regret it. I'll be your slave.
I can bring life back to you, new and fresh.
Why are your eyes always empty... like Linton's eyes?
They're not empty.
If you'd only look deeper.
Look at me.
I'm pretty.
I'm a woman, and I love you.
You're all of life to me.
Let me be a single breath of it for you.
Heathcliff, let your heart look at me just once.
Oh, why did God give me life?
What is it but hunger and pain?
What do you want, Ellen?
What are you doing here?
I want to speak to Miss Isabella.
You can do so in front of me.
Her brother has asked me to bring her home for a visit.
He needs you with him,
Miss Isabella.
Why?
Let go of me, Heathcliff.
Cathy. She's ill.
Yes.
Mr. Edgar wants you to come home at once, Miss Isabella.
She's dying.
You're not going.
She belongs to Edgar if she's dying.
Let her die where she belongs, in Edgar's arms.
Let her die.
Is that better?
Yes.
Isn't there a south wind?
Isn't the snow almost gone?
Quite gone down here, darling.
Just a few patches left.
The sky is blue, and the larks are singing... and the brooks are brimming full.
Will you get me something?
- What do you want, darling?
- Some heather.
There's a beautiful patch near the castle.
I want some from there.
Near the castle?
What castle, darling?
The castle on the moors, Edgar.
Go there, please.
There's no castle on the moors, darling.
There is.
It's on the hill... beyond Wuthering Heights.
- You mean Penistone Crag.
- Yes.
I was a queen there once.
Go there, Edgar.
Get me some heather, please.
I'll go. You sleep while I'm gone, and rest so you'll be better tomorrow.
You've been very dear to me, Edgar.
- Very dear.
- Sleep, darling.
Robert!
Get my horse ready.
I'm going to Dr. Kenneth. Be quick.
Yes, sir.
Come here.
I was dreaming... you might come before I died.
You might come and scowl at me once more.
Oh, Heathcliff... how strong you look.
How many years do you mean to live after I'm gone?
Don't--
Don't let me go.
If I could only hold you till we were both dead.
Will you forget me when I'm in the earth?
I could as soon forget you as my own life.
Cathy, if you die--
Poor Heathcliff. Come.
Let me feel how strong you are.
Strong enough to bring us both back to life, Cathy, if you want to live.
No, Heathcliff. I want to die.
Oh, Cathy.
Why did you kill yourself?
Hold me.
Just hold me.
No, I'll not comfort you.
My tears don't love you, Cathy.
They blight and curse and damn you.
Heathcliff, don't break my heart.
Oh, Cathy, I never broke your heart.
You broke it.
You loved me!
What right to throw love away for the poor fancy thing you felt for him?
For a handful of worldliness?
Misery, death and all the evils
God and man could've handed down... would never have parted us.
You did that alone.
You wandered off... like a wanton, greedy child... to break your heart and mine.
Heathcliff, forgive me.
We have so little time.
Oh, Cathy.
Cathy, your wasted hands.
Kiss me again.
Heathcliff, he's coming. Mr. Linton.
For heaven's sake, go! Only be quick!
It's the last time.
I won't go, Cathy. I'm here.
I'll never leave you again.
I told you, Ellen, when he went away, that night in the rain--
I told you I belonged to him, that he was my life, my being.
Don't listen to her ravings.
It's true.
I'm yours, Heathcliff.
I've never been anyone else's.
She doesn't know what she's saying.
You can still get out.
Go before they get here.
Take me to the window.
Let me look at the moors with you once more.
My darling. Once more.
How beautiful the day is.
Can you see the crag... over there where our castle is?
I'll wait for you... till you come.
Leave her alone.
She's mine.
She's mine now.
Miss Cathy.
Oh, my wild heart.
Miss Cathy.
She's gone.
You've done your last black deed,
Heathcliff. Leave this house.
She's at peace, in heaven and beyond us.
What do they know of heaven or hell, Cathy... who know nothing of life?
Oh, they're praying for you,
Cathy.
I'll pray one prayer with them.
I repeat till my tongue stiffens:
Catherine Earnshaw, may you not rest so long as I live on.
I killed you.
Haunt me, then.
Haunt your murderer.
I know that ghosts have wandered
Be with me always.
Take any form. Drive me mad.
Only do not leave me in this dark alone, where I cannot find you.
I cannot live without my life.
I cannot die without my soul.
Oh, Cathy.
Oh, my dear.
I can still see and hear that wild hour...
I can still see and hear that wild hour... with poor Heathcliff trying to tear away the veil between death and life... crying out to Cathy's soul... to haunt him and torment him... till he died.
You say that was Cathy's ghost I heard at the window?
Not her ghost... but Cathy's love, stronger than time itself... still sobbing for its unlived days... and uneaten bread.
- What's the matter, man?
- I've gone mad.
- Stark raving mad.
- Dr. Kenneth.
I saw Heathcliff out in the moors in the snow with a woman.
- A woman, you say?
- Yes, a woman.
I saw her with him plain as my own eyes.
It was Cathy.
Go on, man. What happened?
No, I don't know who it was.
I was trying to get up near to them... when suddenly my horse reared and plunged, and I was thrown.
I called out to them, but they didn't hear me, so I followed them.
I tell you I saw them both!
He had his arm about her.
So I climbed up after them... and I found him.
Only him-- alone-- with only his footprints in the snow.
Under a high rock on a ledge near Penistone Crag.
Yes.
Was he dead?
No, not dead, Dr. Kenneth.
Not alone.
He's with her.
They've only just begun to live.
Good-bye, Heathcliff.
Good-bye, my wild, sweet Cathy.
MAN: Chandu the Magician.
MAN: In the three years that thou has dwelt among us... thou has conquered the atma of the spirt... and found thy reward in the powers proclaimed by Shiva.
Thou shalt look into the eyes of men... and they shall be as straw in thine hands.
Thou shalt cause them to see what is not there... even unto a gathering of 12 times 12.
My son, I proclaim thee one of the sacred company of the yogi... and bestow upon thee the name of Chandu.
Thou hast done well, my son.
To few indeed of thy race have the secrets of the yogi been revealed.
To you, my teacher, I express my thanks.
- What more can I learn?
- Nothing, now. The world needs thee.
Go forth in thy youth and strength... and conquer the evil that threatens mankind.
I have gazed in the crystal, and I've seen the forces of death and destruction... rising from the brain of a madman.
Look.
- CHANDU: Who is this man?
- YOGI: This man is Roxor.
YOGI: Last of an ancient family that lived in Alexandria.
He has built a home in the rock temple of Madu... that stands on the great cliffs above the third cataract of the Nile.
But why am I appointed to fight this man?
It is fate who has chosen thee for the task, my son.
And because no man fights so well as when he is protecting his loved ones... fate has thrown thine own family in the path of this human monster.
Look.
CHANDU: Dorothy... my sister.
YOGI: Yes. Her husband has brought his family to Cairo... so that he maybe near his friend Roxor.
YOGI: This man, Robert Regent... has a secret of enormous power.
CHANDU:
Yes. For years, my brother-in-law... has worked to perfect a death ray strong enough to destroy whole cities.
- (NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE)
- He's never found it.
YOGI:
This death ray in the hands of Roxor...
Means an end to goodness...
An end to all that is noble... all that is sane.
Can't you do something?
Surely the police must be able to find some trace of him.
Oh, please telephone me as soon as you have any news at all.
- Thanks.
- Oh, Mother. Mother, you mustn't worry.
- I'm sure we'll hear from Father soon.
- (DOOR OPENS)
- Mother? Look at the letters I found.
- Where did you get them, Betty?
- In the laboratory.
- You didn't go out there in the dark now?
Oh, Mother, how could anyone be hanging around the garden in this sandstorm?
I thought I might find some clues in them.
But you mustn't go outside again.
Why? Did you see something?
Tell me. Did you bolt the door when you came through?
I... I don't remember.
- What did you see, Mother?
- Nothing, Bobby.
It may be foolish, but I thought I saw a face peering in at that window.
Oh, Mother, let's go away from here.
We can't, dearest. Not until we have some news from your father.
- (CLATTERING)
- Listen!
I thought I heard a door close.
- What's that?
- (EERIE RINGING)
Well, what's the matter?
Don't you recognize me?
- Oh, Frank! (SOBBING)
- There, there.
Now, don't cry. Don't cry.
I've come here to help you find Robert.
- Uncle Frank, do you know about Father?
- Yes, dear.
- Do you know where he is?
- I want to talk to you alone, Dorothy.
My, my, Betty Lou, how you've grown.
And Bobby too. But he's too big to kiss.
Sure. We're grown up pretty nearly,
Uncle Frank... so why can't we stay and hear what you know about Father?
- I'll tell you everything later.
- There's something I want to know now.
What was that bell that rang just before you came in?
That was an astral bell.
It tells you when a yogi is near.
- You're really a yogi now?
- Mm-hmm.
And when I hear that bell, I know it's a warning from a yogi that danger threatens.
- (HOWLING)
- What's that?
DOROTHY: It's only a pride of dogs down by the river.
"Now that I know your plans, no money on earth...
"could persuade me to sell you the secret of the death ray.
"If you try to approach me again,
I shall denounce you to the authorities.
I'm convinced you are a madman and should be dealt with accordingly."
Do you know whom this letter was intended for?
- No.
- Roxor.
- Roxor?
- I'm sure of it. Robert's his prisoner.
- Where?
- That I don't know.
I tried to communicate with his mind, but the crystal revealed nothing.
He must be...
- Dead?
- No, no.
Just probably drugged, that's all.
Unconscious.
Robert Regent, I'm calling you. Calling!
You see? It's useless.
Calling him has no response.
(SCREAMING) Help!
Let me go! Stop it!
- Who sent you here?
- Roxor.
- Where did you see Roxor?
- At the wine cellar of... (INDISTINCT)
Open in the name of Osiris... the blind eyes, sealed lips, deaf ears.
- ## (MIDEASTERN)
- (CHATTERING)
I wish to see Roxor.
The effendi is speaking with a friend and may not be disturbed.
He will see me.
Tell him it is Princess Nadji.
MAN: Bring the princess here.
We must not let her find you here, Abdullah.
I don't know yet whether she is to be a friend or an enemy.
If she proves to be an enemy,
I beg you let me deal with her.
Why? Do you hate the princess Nadji?
I hate her.
Yet I want her more than
I've ever wanted any woman before.
Very well, Abdullah.
If Nadji opposes me... and you serve me well... there shall be a new slave in your harem.
ROXOR: Come in.
Let me have your cloak.
Then I may not feast my eyes on your lovely figure?
- Why have you sent for me, Roxor?
- Why?
To offer you my friendship.
- Well, here we are.
- Yes, but how are we going to get in?
You're not going in.
You're going to stay here and watch.
But it'd be much more fun to go in with you.
Listen, Bobby, in case anything happens to me... your mother and Betty Lou will need a man to protect them.
Stay here.
You have the word, brother?
Open in the name of Osiris... the blind eyes, sealed lips, deaf ears.
But my people are happy and contented.
The great dams have multiplied our crops a hundredfold.
What if I destroy those dams?
- What?
- Yes.
I can do it with one blast from my death ray.
Then where will your people be?
More than a billion tons of water will sweep down on them... drowning them like rats.
The greatest flood since the biblical deluge.
So, unless my people join in making you a modern pharaoh... you will annihilate them.
Pharaoh.
I shall be greater than any pharaoh.
Civilization and all its works shall be destroyed.
Men shall return to savagery... following only one supreme intelligence... me.
You see, you're my prisoner.
Every man in this house is my servant.
- You can't keep me here.
- I shan't try.
You are to be sent to a friend of mine as a present.
Did you call me, master?
Take this woman through the tunnel to the river. A boat is waiting.
Come!
Come, Nadji, quick.
- Chandu!
- (MOUTHS WORDS) Come.
What's the matter with you?
Stop them! Stop those two!
After them!
Stop them!
- Everything aboard, Ahmed?
- Yes, effendi.
Very well.
Mother, is she a real princess?
Yes, Betty.
Uncle Frank says she's descended... from a long line of ancient Egyptian kings.
- And are we really going to her palace?
- No, Bobby.
- We're going to her dahabieh.
- Her "daha" what?
Oh, Bobby, don't you know that's a houseboat?
And the princess says we'll have to travel all night by camelback.
Won't that be great?
Wasn't it strange that chance should have sent you... to look for Roxor just when
I needed you most?
It wasn't chance, Nadji. It was fate.
I mean, it was, uh... It was fate that brought me in front of that door.
At first I didn't recognize you.
You see, it's three years since last we met.
- Remember?
- Yes.
Those days in Paris...
I've thought a lot about them.
I know.
In the yogi monastery, there's a pool... where you can see the face of anyone who's thinking of you.
And did you see my face in it?
If you would have looked in it, you would have seen mine much oftener.
Mother, do you think the princess can help us in finding Father?
I don't know, darling, but Uncle Frank says we'll be much safer... as her guests than if we're left here alone.
Well, I shouldn't be frightened anywhere with Uncle Frank.
Oh, look. There are the camels.
El Mahafi, are you ready to leave?
Yes, Princess, and tomorrow's sun will see us there.
Cush. Cush.
You bloomin' idiot.
Don't you understand plain English?
Voulez-vous cush?
Oh, why don't you kneel down when I ask you to?
Aw, I wish I had it.
- Miggles!
- Captain Chandler.
(CHUCKLES) That's all right, Miggles.
Don't salute me, and don't call me Captain Chandler.
We're out of the army now.
What are you doing in that funny-looking getup?
Nursemaid to a blooming camel.
Oh, I'm so happy I met you, Captain.
You've gotta get me out of this.
You've gotta give me a job.
I'll work for you for nothing. After all,
I was a good orderly, wasn't I, sir?
Are you still drinking, Miggles?
Well, sir... (COUGHS)
Changin' the subject, do you still do your magic tricks?
Oh, much better ones. Look at me.
Now look behind you.
- Aaah!
- (CHUCKLING)
Take off your hat.
- Why, you dirty little snoop.
- Who, me?
Oh. Oh, he can talk.
- Oh, take him away.
- (CHUCKLES)
- Make him go away.
- That's all right. He's only in your mind.
Oh, don't tell me I'm going balmy.
He's gone!
How would you like to take a very dangerous trip with me?
Sure. You know me. I love danger.
All right, then. Come on.
Oh, thank you, Captain. Thank you.
Every time you get drunk you're going to see that little fella.
- Understand?
- I understand.
So help me goodness, governor, this is the finish.
When a man starts to see things like that...
- Well, it's time to quit.
- Okay.
- You all right, Princess Nadji?
- Yes.
Miggles. Behave.
I can't thank you enough, Nadji.
Now that Dorothy and the children are safe...
I'll be free to find Robert.
I think I can help you.
- You, Nadji?
- Yes.
Roxor has been seen by some of my people... near the ruins of Madu.
Where are they?
- On the third cataract.
- How far is it?
Not very far.
My boat can be there in 24 hours.
Go straight to Roxor and inform the master... that the princess and the foreigner are on their way to rescue Regent.
Tell him I will see that the white man gets no further than the houseboat.
And now, tell me.
Have you married since I saw you last?
No. That's one feat of magic that requires a beautiful assistant.
- But you've been in love?
- All the time.
(LAUGHS) I might have known.
There are too many charming women in the world.
Not too many.
Oh, now, don't misunderstand me, Nadji.
All the time in love, but always with the same woman.
Do I know her?
You should.
She was a present to your father and mother on your birthday.
(LAUGHS) You're never serious, are you?
Never so serious as now, Nadji.
Tell me. Have you found someone?
Even if I had, my life belongs to my people.
You know, you told me that three years ago.
You think I'm foolish, don't you?
No, dear. Just very, very young... and making an unnecessary sacrifice.
Sometimes I think so too.
Hello.
You have a visitor.
His name is Abdullah.
He's been coming here very often lately.
Oh. I see.
For the white man.
It is Roxor who commands.
NADJI: I'll order some refreshments.
Ali? Some wine.
- You must be choked with sand and dirt.
- You're right.
I love the looks of the desert, but I hate the taste of it.
I thought I'd pay you a surprise visit.
- I'm afraid I'm rather in the way.
- No, not at all.
But unfortunately, my boat is starting at once.
And is the gentleman I just saw making this romantic trip with you?
Romantic is hardly the word.
With a woman as lovely as you are, Nadji... it couldn't be business.
You have a strange way of paying compliments, Abdullah.
Who is this friend of yours?
He is called Chandu.
Chandu.
Beg pardon, Captain.
Is this where the danger starts?
Not yet.
- (RINGING)
- That's funny. A telephone way out here?
That's strange.
You haven't told me yet.
Why are you going up the Nile?
- You know Roxor?
- Ro... Roxor.
Oh, is he that crazy scientist who lives in one of the rock temples?
Yes.
No, I've never met him.
Is he the man you're going to visit?
I understand that Roxor has discovered... many valuable relics of the 12th Egyptian Dynasty.
Wait.
Drink.
Go on, drink.
CHANDU: This wine is... is poisoned
CHANDU: Robert Regent, I'm calling.
Robert Regent, I am calling.
Robert Regent, where are you?
Look. Look!
The crystal's clearing at last.
NADJI: The great rock temple at Madu.
CHANDU:
Roxor is trying to build a huge death ray.
It's Robert. He's still alive.
NADJI: Roxor is there.
CHANDU: Robert hasn't told him the secret.
NADJI:
Oh, he'll torture him until he does.
CHANDU: That's your servant...
The man who gave us the poisoned wine.
Roxor is punishing him because he failed.
NADJI: Chandu, this man is heartless.
Roxor will kill him.
Not as long as he has any hope of forcing Robert to give up his secret.
What was that message the Arab just brought?
I don't know.
Nadji, you say you know the way to this temple?
Yes.
- (MOANS)
- Quiet, Miggles, quiet.
Oh, Captain!
Quiet, Miggles. Quiet.
Miggles, stay here and keep watch.
Yes, Captain. I can manage.
(GASPING) Captain! Captain!
Captain! Captain!
(MOANING) Captain!
Captain! Captain! Captain! Aaah!
Captain! Captain! Captain!
- Captain!
- What's the matter? What's happened?
One of them bloomin' stone idols hopped off his perch and ran away.
- And he pinched my hat.
- You've been drinking again, have you?
So help me, it's true. I swear it on the heads of me unborn children.
Captain! Captain!
Look!
- Chandu!
- Fear not, Princess. You are to live.
But you will see your friends die.
(MOANING) Oh, Mother.
Before we die... accept my blessing.
MAN: Open! Open!
- A fiend!
- A fiend!
Halt!
My will shall be your will.
Now I command you. Take me to the effendi Professor Robert Regent.
- He is not here.
- Speak the truth.
- The master has taken him away.
- Where to?
To the secret market of Bab Doukkala.
There, unless he speaks, he will see his daughter sold as a slave.
- What does it mean?
- It means that Roxor can do nothing... by threatening Robert, so he's kidnapped Betty Lou. Come!
Miggles.
(MOANING) Oh, Captain.
Miggles.
Oh, governor, take away those snakes.
Come on, Miggles.
Pick up your gun. Pick up your gun!
(GASPS) Take it away! Take it away!
Take it away! Take it away!
Never another drop, so help me.
Are you ready to tell me the secret of the death ray?
No.
You still may change your mind.
Never.
- Father! Father!
- Betty Lou!
My child.
What are you going to do with her?
That depends on you.
Will you tell me the secret of the ray?
- No.
- Take her to the block.
- ROBERT: No! No!
- No, no, no! (SOBBING)
- Don't!
- Father!
- (SOBBING) Father!
- ROBERT: Don't take her!
- Don't!
- Please stop! Father! Please!
Let her go!
You shall stand at that window and see her sold.
Help me, Father! Don't!
Let me go! Father, help me!
Kill me.
Kill me if you will, but let her go.
Courage, Betty Lou.
It's not too late to save her.
No. Whatever happens to me or mine,
I'll never tell you.
ROXOR: Get out!
Master! Master!
- (CHIRPING)
- Master! Master!
Allah, save us!
I saw the gold with mine own eyes!
This is magic!
Allah be praised!
Stop that man! Run after him!
Run after him!
Guard!
Abdullah!
Guard!
- Why didn't you hold him at the gate?
- He never passed the gate.
When these hands tried to seize him, there was nothing there but a burnoose.
That one.
- GUARD: The devil!
- (ALL SHOUTING)
Now I know who is fighting us.
Chandu... A man who has at his command the wizardry of the East.
- What is his power?
- Ah.
Hypnotism, nothing more.
Is there no way through which we can attack him?
Yes, one.
Samson's strength was in his hair.
Chandu's strength... is in his eyes.
Mother, here they are.
- Oh, Betty!
- Bobby!
- Oh, my poor child.
- Mother, dear, please don't worry about me.
It was dreadful to see Father like that, his face drawn with agony.
- So desperate!
- Don't. I can't bear it.
CHANDU: Now, Dorothy, don't worry.
Please, Frank.
Can't something be done to save him?
I'm going right back after him, dear, as soon as I get fresh horses.
There, there.
- Miggles, be ready to leave in half an hour.
- Yes, sir.
We're going to the rock temple.
All right, sir.
The rock temple, I think he said.
This calls for another drink.
Walking idols and guns that turns into snakes?
This certainly calls for a drink.
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
Who? Me?
What for?
- For seeing things again.
- Now, go on. Hop it.
Is that a nice way to behave?
I thought you was a gentleman.
And I thought you were a gentleman too.
We were both mistaken, weren't we?
Don't you talk back at me.
I'm not talking back at you.
You're talking to yourself.
Miggles, aren't you ashamed of ourselves?
Every time you drink that liquor, you're not yourself.
If you're not yourself, how am I to know who I am?
If you're not you and I'm not me, then who are we?
Neither of us. Miggles, behave.
All right. I give in.
I'll never touch another.
- Nadji, why this costume?
- I'm going with you.
- No.
- But I might help you.
No, darling.
That last trip was too dangerous.
I couldn't risk losing you again.
At least I can go as far as the oasis.
Please.
If anything happened to you, Nadji, dear... do you think I could ever forgive myself?
Do I really mean so much?
- More than so much.
- (COUGHING)
- The horses is here, sir.
- Nadji.
No, thank you. You'd better order a horse for me, Miggles.
- That's all right. You can have mine.
- Miggles!
What's the matter with you?
You seem nervous.
Well, it's...
It's all this excitement, sir.
Could you fix it up for me, so I could have a drink without seeing anything?
You haven't had one all day?
No, sir.
All right, Miggles. You may have one then.
- Here's to you.
- To you, Miggles.
As I said, sir, here's to you.
Oh, go and take a good swim!
Be careful. This is tear gas.
If you break it, it'll blind you.
CHANDU: Well, here we are.
- Dear, keep yourself hidden.
- Don't you worry about me.
You have more important things on your mind.
Never anything more important than you,
Nadji, dear.
Sometimes I wonder if you really know the meaning of danger.
I do, darling. I do when it concerns you.
You know, I'm not a bit afraid... when we are together, and you speak to me like that.
When you look at me like that, nothing else matters.
Be careful. If not for your own sake... then for mine?
A bargain.
And you, darling, be careful... for mine.
Take no chances.
Chandu!
Ride, Nadji! Ride away quick!
(GASPING) I'm helpless.
Roxor was right.
Your magic comes from your eyes.
- Chandu!
- Bring him to Roxor!
DEATH RAY WORKER: Only Regent can do it!
Well done, Abdullah.
Now I'll have my revenge on Chandu.
Yes, but that doesn't tell you how to operate your death ray.
No?
You followed Regent's plans in building this elaborate machine... but he still withholds the knowledge to release its power.
Regent was near to breaking when he saw his daughter on the slave block, wasn't he?
Yes.
If Roxor threatens his wife and children... what then, Abdullah?
In a few hours, his whole family will be here.
How?
In that cell, he's now writing a letter to them.
MAN: Effendi!
- Is the letter ready?
- Where's Roxor?
He's not here.
If you'll take it to my family, they will reward you.
It's only a letter of farewell.
- The letter will be delivered, effendi.
- Thank you.
Now look, Abdullah.
For the wife of Robert Regent.
ROXOR'S HENCHMAN:
For the wife of the effendi.
- Are you sure that's really from Father?
- Look, darling, it's his writing.
Oh, wouldn't it be wonderful if we really could save him?
We must save him. I'll get ready.
But, Mother...
There's no need for you to go.
This is a man's job.
- But there's no man here.
- Well, how about me? And Miggles?
- How's that, sir?
- I was just reminding Mother you're a man.
Does she have to be reminded?
If I could only get this bandage off my eyes.
- Oh, if I could only help you.
- Oh, Nadji.
Nadji, what a fool I was to let you come with me.
Don't say that, Chandu.
If these are to be the last hours of your life, I want them to be mine too.
If I could only get you out of here, see you safe once again.
It doesn't matter what happens to me.
I feel so much closer to you now than ever before.
Oh, Nadji, I can't think of losing you... now that I've found you again.
Tell me, if all this hadn't happened... would you have left Egypt, gone with me?
You had only to ask, and I'd have followed you anywhere.
If this is the end, Nadji... let me hear you say "I love you."
I love you.
And I love you.
Well, Chandu, we meet at last.
It isn't quite as you planned though, is it?
Remember this, Roxor.
That the best laid plans of men sometimes go astray.
What do you mean?
I mean that my will is stronger than yours... that it will conquer you.
- That's a lie!
- Is it?
Then why are you afraid to look me in the eyes?
I'm not afraid.
Your eyes would have no effect on me.
Then take off this bandage!
If I were alone, I would.
But these silly natives, they believe your tricks.
You're afraid, I tell you.
Take the bandage from his eyes.
Take it off.
Stop! Stop!
Don't let him fool you.
Get rid of him once and for all.
You're right. (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
You can't do that!
- You can't bury him alive!
- (CHUCKLES)
Why not?
It was a favorite punishment among the priests of Isis who built this temple.
No!
You'd be far better off to kill him.
Why?
Yogis have been known to remain buried for days.
ROXOR: Yes.
But not underwater.
No!
- (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
- No!
No!
- Roxor. Roxor!
- Why are you calling him?
I'll tell him how to work the machine.
Robert, you mustn't!
You said it would mean death to millions.
I'm going to, I tell you, if he'll let you and the children go.
We won't go!
We won't save our lives at such a cost.
Hmm. Why, it's a family reunion.
Let them go, Roxor.
I beg of you, let them go.
There is a way out of this cell, and I'll show it to them.
But not while you are in there.
Just let me stay here.
I don't care what you do with me.
Now, look.
Mother!
ROXOR:
I told you there was a way out, Regent.
That is a river down there... where your friend Chandu has gone.
Have mercy, Roxor!
Stop!
Close it! Close it!
- Will you tell me now?
- Stop!
Mother!
Mother! (WHIMPERING)
- (SCREAMS)
- Stop!
Stop!
- Stop! Stop!
- You'll show me how to work the death ray?
Yes. Yes.
How far will the beam carry?
- Halfway around the world.
- Ah!
Hurry, hurry!
Is it ready?
- (WHISTLE)
- Yes.
Back to his cell.
At last.
I'm king of all.
That lever is my scepter.
London, New York, Imperial Rome...
I can blast them all into a heap of smoking ruins.
Cities of the world shall perish.
All that lives... shall know me as master and tremble at my word.
Paris.
City of fools.
Proud of their Napoleon.
What will they think...
- when they feel the power of Roxor?
- (BOOM)
And England... with its sacred traditions...
Its king. Its triumph... its... its navy...
- will be helpless.
- (BOOM)
They shall bow before me in worship.
Me... Roxor.
- (BOOM)
- I will destroy the dams of the Nile.
And its roaring floods shall sweep down upon... hundreds of thousands... drowning them like rats!
Roxor, the god... whose hand deals death!
Stop! I command you!
Take your hand from that control.
No, you don't frighten me.
You can't move that lever.
I'll move it now!
And you're standing right in the front of the ray.
Your hand is powerless to move, Roxor.
It's a lie.
And you shall be the first man for the ray to kill.
I have come out of a coffin from the depths of the Nile.
My will brought me here... and that will is stronger than yours.
You are helpless.
- No!
- Drop your hands.
Now, stand there.
- Don't move.
- ROBERT: Chandu!
Dorothy! Robert! Are you safe?
Are you all right?
ROBERT: There... It's over... there.
I've doubled the speed of the generator.
The voltage is mounting.
The ambient's at white heat.
The machine will explode in a moment.
- Get out of here, quick!
- Not that way, Frank!
I'm all right. Hurry!
For years I've wanted you, and now I've got you.
- You beast!
- There's no use fighting.
Nadji!
Nadji! Nadji!
Nadji!
Chandu! Look out!
Nadji! Na...
- Captain!
- (BUZZING)
Chandu! Chandu!
- Where are they?
- Let's go.
- Are you all right, Nadji, dear?
- Uncle Frank! Uncle Frank!
Children! Dorothy!
- Thank heaven you're safe, Frank.
- That was brave of you, Robert.
You set the machine to destroy even your whole family... rather than give it to Roxor.
Aaah!
Help!
LITTLE MIGGLES: Where can we get a drink?
You oughta be ashamed of yourself.
Come on.
Come in.
- Sir Lionel Barton, sir.
- Oh, yes, show him in. Show him in.
Come in, sir.
Well, Nayland, what's up?
Well, Lionel, before we go into that,
I want to ask you a very funny question.
- Do you love your country?
- Oh, yes.
All through the war and the Depression and the high taxes and the low rents.
I shall never love another.
Well, Lionel, the British government is asking you to risk your life again.
- Oh, very well.
- All right then.
After you leave here, you're going to the British Museum to meet some friends of yours.
You're going to ask them to join you in an expedition to go to the edge of the Gobi Desert and hunt for the lost and buried tomb of Genghis Khan.
How the deuce did you know all that?
It's my business to know things.
Lionel, you must find that tomb.
We can't allow for any failure, and you must be the first to find it.
Why all the hurry?
- You know Fu Manchu?
- Yes.
He's trying to find it, too.
Oh, I didn't know he was an archaeologist.
Oh, no, he's not.
He's insane for power.
- What do you expect to find in that tomb?
- Records, the golden plate with the threat of Genghis Khan to return, the golden mask he wore and the famous golden scimitar.
Exactly. Of course, in your hands, these things will be merely interesting archaeological specimens to go into the British Museum.
But should Fu Manchu put that mask across his wicked eyes and take that scimitar into his bony, cruel hands, all Asia rises.
He'll declare himself Genghis
Khan come to life again, and he'll lead hundreds of millions of men to sweep the world.
And that, my friend, is what you have got to prevent.
You must find that grave. You must be the first to find it, and you must bring those pretty things back to England.
Of course it's genuine.
Don't you know that the Equus polydactylous, Anchitherium,
Coryphodon, Equus sivalensis:::
But you forget, Equus asiaticus, Equus przewalskii,
Equus lebii, Equus chenensis, Hipparion and...
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
Sir Lionel not here yet?
No, Von Berg. It's a funny time to call a meeting.
Good evening, gentlemen.
Sorry to have kept you waiting.
I'd hoped to have a long talk, but something's come up that's altered my plans slightly.
Fairgyle, I want two of your men. My two old friends, Von Berg and McLeod.
- Another expedition?
- I was just getting bored with London.
- Can I have them?
- I think you have them already.
Where do we go now?
Well, perhaps I can best answer your question by first telling you that I think I've discovered the buried tomb of Genghis Khan.
- What?
- This can't be so!
Frankly, Barton, I don't believe it.
You always dreamt of this dead raider.
Carnarvon made his dream come true.
Think of what he found in Egypt.
I don't care what it is. I go with you. Where do we go?
I'll show you.
We move secretly.
So it's a toil over these mountains into this valley here.
Then up again and over this range of hills, and right here, on the edge of the Gobi Desert, that's where we camp.
Now, I want you to understand the truth.
From the moment we start, we're in great danger.
There's a fanatic in the East, Dr. Fu Manchu.
- And we have to beat him.
- A Chinaman beat me? He couldn't do it.
Thanks, old friend.
Then we meet again on Sunday to arrange all details.
Get away by Monday.
Thank you a thousand times.
I think I can promise you some great acquisitions for the museum.
That'll be fine, Barton, fine.
Well, good night. Thanks once again.
See you on Sunday night, Doctor.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Terry, I just don't think
I can stand this any longer.
Steady, Sheila.
A whole week not knowing whether he's alive or...
I say, do you know where
Commissioner Smith is?
- We've been waiting nearly 20 minutes.
- No, sir.
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning, Vernon.
Sheila, sorry I'm late. I was detained.
- Hello, Terry.
- Hello, Nayland.
I brought Terry along.
Have you heard anything?
If I knew anything, I'd tell you.
Excuse me.
Sit down. Sit down, Sheila. I'll be with you in just a moment.
Sheila, you've got to be very brave.
Oh, Nayland, I won't believe my father's dead.
No, no, no, neither will I.
I've just come from a conference with Von Berg and McLeod.
Fine chaps, those men. Depend on them.
Oh, come to the point. You're keeping something back from me.
Sheila, did you ever hear of a Dr. Fu Manchu?
Yes, I've heard Father speak of him to the men.
I remember I couldn't sleep at nights thinking of the terrible...
Nayland, don't tell me that man has anything to do with this.
That my father has been taken by...
You know what they say about him in the East, his cruelty, his unspeakable tortures.
- Nayland, he'll kill him, I know!
- Oh, no, no, Sheila.
- I know he won't do that.
- What does he want of him?
Well, he wants the secret about the tomb of Genghis Khan, and, naturally, he turned to your father.
Oh, I know.
You think they can make him talk.
They can't. I know him better than you.
- She's right, sir.
- I hope so.
They have ways in the East of shattering the strongest courage.
That's why McLeod and Von Berg have agreed to carry on with the expedition, to finish the job of getting to the tomb before Fu Manchu.
- I'm going with Dr. Von Berg.
- Sheila, that's no place for a woman.
Oh, I know. You think I'll crack under it, but I won't.
My father would hate me if I did.
I know much more about the tomb than they do.
I know where it's located.
I can save them days.
Don't you see? Every second counts.
- Sheila.
- It's no use.
- Sheila, I protest.
- I tell you it's no use. I'm going.
The Englishman is here.
Send him in. And tell my daughter I want to see her.
Send him in.
- I want to know the meaning of this.
- Sit there.
You'll answer my question.
Sit there.
Can you remember much of what has happened in the past week, Sir Lionel?
I was attacked in the British
Museum, drugged, of course.
I think I was under the influence of drugs for days.
Then I was in a plane. Now I'm here.
You're Fu Manchu, aren't you?
I'm a Doctor of Philosophy from Edinburgh.
I'm a Doctor of Law from Christ's College.
I'm a Doctor of Medicine from Harvard.
My friends out of courtesy call me Doctor.
Oh, I beg your pardon.
Well, Three Times Doctor, what do you want of me?
I have sent for you to make your fortune.
What good are these relics of a dead warrior to you?
Oh, our English people like to look at them on holidays.
Are they worth a million pounds to you?
My dear fellow, I can't sell what I haven't got.
But you will tell me where they are, for money, I mean.
Not for anything in the world.
- Did you send for me, my father?
- My daughter.
Explain to this gentleman the rewards that might be his.
Point out to him the delights of our lovely country, the promise of our beautiful women.
Even my daughter. Even that for you.
Fu Manchu, I'm not for sale.
You've read about this, Barton, the torture of the bell. It never stops.
Minute after minute. Hour after hour. Day after day.
Seems harmless, doesn't it? Just a bell ringing.
But the percussion and the repercussion of sound against your eardrums will soften and destroy them until the sound is magnified a thousand times.
You can't move. You can't sleep.
You will be frantic with thirst.
You will be unspeakably foul.
But here you will lie day after day, until you tell.
You'll be hanged!
Oh, Himmel:
Much more of this, and I won't have no hands left.
Why, we haven't even started, Doctor.
Just wait till we get in the tomb and start to dig out the jolly old skeleton himself.
We've been lucky at that, Von Berg.
We haven't been bothered by any curious Chinamen.
Quite right, Mac, and I hope the same good luck continues when we find it.
If we do.
Aren't you hungry?
Just nod your head, and I'll feed you.
Do you want it? Well?
But I won't talk.
I won't talk.
Doctor! Doctor!
- Mac, I believe I've hit it! Look.
- Let me see.
Come on. Come on, everybody, dig.
Oh, look!
The seal of Genghis Khan!
- Sheila! Sheila!
- Shovel.
He'd be proud of you,
Sheila, mighty proud.
Oh, hurry.
Sheila, it looks like it runs over this way now.
Hurry. Hurry.
Hurry. Hurry.
Rest and quiet.
Now for a nice, long drink.
I forgot to tell you it was salt.
Fiend.
Barton.
Barton.
- Fresh water.
- No.
- Fresh food.
- No.
- And a bath.
- No.
- Sleep.
- No.
- Sleep, Barton, sleep.
- No.
- Day in, day out, sleep.
- No.
Now, tell me. Tell me.
No. No.
- Well, who goes in first?
- Terry. He found the slab.
All right. Age before beauty.
It's all right. Come on.
Think of it, Sheila, we're the first to enter the tomb of the great Genghis Khan.
It's overwhelming. I can hardly believe it.
It just staggers my imagination.
Aye, and you're standing in the first unplundered tomb of a king that died nearly 700 years ago.
Look. Solid gold. Enough to pay a king's ransom.
And sealed with the seal of Genghis
Khan. Terry, give me your knife.
Remember the curse on Tutankhamen's tomb?
All the people connected with it died soon after its opening.
That's a lot of bosh.
Silly superstitions.
They would have died...
What's it say, Doctor?
"May the curse of the
Gods descend upon him
"and his forever
"who dares enter herein. "
I don't like to mar the beauty of these doors, but I have my orders.
It's got to be done.
- Mac, give me the ax.
- I'm afraid of this.
- Afraid of what?
- That curse. Those hideous faces.
Now, Sheila, pull yourself together.
Your father would have done the same things if he was here.
Mac, save those pieces.
- The greatest fighter of them all.
- Yeah.
As powerful in death as he was in life.
Countless hordes still worship in his name.
- Well, come on, let's go to work.
- Righto.
You know, I have a feeling that the sooner we get these relics in the hands of Sir Nayland, the sooner we'll have news of your father, Sheila.
Look out, Terry.
Oh, that's all right, darling.
Just a friendly little tarantula.
I have brought you here for great tidings.
I am the most unfortunate of men.
I have no son to follow me.
Therefore, in shame, I ask you to receive a message from my ugly and insignificant daughter.
Speak, my daughter.
I have seen a vision.
The prophecy is about to be fulfilled.
Genghis Khan, masked in his plate of gold, bearing the scimitar that none but he could ever wield comes back to us.
I've seen a vision of countless hordes swarming to recapture the world.
I've seen the victorious.
I've heard the shouts of the dead and the dying drowned by the victorious cries of our people,
"Genghis Khan comes back.
"Genghis Khan leads the
East against the world! "
- Well, Mac.
- Well, it's my old friend Smith.
Nayland! This is a surprise.
- Sir Nayland!
- Hello, Terry.
- He's looking fine, isn't he?
- Yes.
Oh, Nayland. What of my father?
We'll talk about that later, Sheila.
Take her in the house, Terrence.
- Wait a minute, darling. I'll strike a light.
- No, no, don't. Don't do that.
Bring all that stuff in here as quietly as you can and stow it over there.
Oh, Nayland, please, please.
Tell me about my father.
Nothing. Nothing yet.
Pretty inadequate report, isn't it, Sheila?
- What are we going to do?
- I'm doing everything I can.
We can't find Fu Manchu, although we do know he's around here and very near.
So if I can get all of you and this stuff out of the country, then I can deal with him. He'll show his hands.
Well, look, Nayland, if you think he's around here, why do we have to leave the country until we find him?
Young man, your business is to obey orders.
And I'll have you all out of the country by tomorrow,
- every one of you.
- Oh, why?
Because I'm worried. I don't like the looks of it.
Why can't we have a little light, Nayland?
Because this house has got to appear empty as it has been for months.
It's our only safety.
- So understand. No lights.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Miss Sheila, off to bed with you.
Come along and I'll show you where your room is.
They all open off this courtyard, and yours is here.
So, this is what we've been fighting for.
- Aye. That's what we came for.
- Yeah, that's it.
And they believe in a bauble like that.
Will we ever understand these Eastern races?
Will we ever learn anything?
Well, we'll have to take turns watching this thing tonight.
McLeod, you take the first four hours.
No, I'll stay up all night. Then
I'll know everything's all right.
All right.
- But I'm going to lock you in.
- Aye.
- Good night, Mac.
- Good night.
Terrence, open the door.
- Good night, McLeod.
- Good night, Smith.
Terry!
McLeod.
Mac.
What's happened?
He was black.
Black.
But he didn't take it.
He didn't...
For as much as the Almighty
God with his great mercy hath taken unto himself the soul of our dear brother here departed, we therefore commit his body to the ground.
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
Amen.
Amen.
I don't want to be abrupt, but we've got to get down to brass tacks.
Now, understand, no one leaves this compound today.
You travel tonight.
But we've been traveling for days without rest.
- We can't do it, Nayland.
- You must.
So, Sheila, you go to your room and sleep until I call you.
Have no fear. We're watching over you.
You get all the sleep you can.
Von Berg, you better get some rest also. Terry, you take the first watch.
Bolt that door, Terry.
See here, Nayland, we're done in. Exhausted.
We can't go tonight.
Why, think of Sheila.
She's the one I am thinking of.
Do you suppose for a moment
Fu Manchu doesn't know we have a beautiful white girl here with us?
He wants the sword and mask. Suppose he takes them?
- Suppose he takes Sheila also?
- I hadn't thought of that.
We're in the enemy's country now. And a wise enemy.
We're fighting a thing we can't understand with everything against us.
That's why you've got to get Sheila and those relics
- into a place of safety tonight.
- I understand.
- You really think he knows about Sheila?
- He knows everything.
He knows every move we make.
His spies are all around us.
I can't even trust our own coolies.
Someone's watching us. I can feel it.
Now, just pull yourself together, laddie.
Pull yourself together.
Got a revolver?
- Yes.
- Good.
I'll go out and look over the camels and pick out the ones
I think are fit to make the dash tonight.
Don't you go in that tower room. I'll be back in a moment.
- Cheerio.
- Cheerio.
- Good afternoon, my friend.
- Well?
A message from my master, Dr. Fu Manchu.
I just want to know one thing. Is Sir Lionel alive?
But what makes you think not?
- Does that mean that he's dead?
- But of course not.
My master's quite excelled at surgery, and a little accident...
What's your message?
My master would very much like a certain sword and mask.
I don't think so.
Your fiancée is very fond of her father, I believe.
- I'm thinking about that.
- Terry!
- What is it?
- Nothing.
Is it nothing to know that your father is well?
- Oh, where is he?
- Fu Manchu's got him.
No! Is he all right?
Look out, Terry. This may be a trick.
There is unfortunately a certain amount of evidence to the contrary.
Oh, it's not your father's. It's a cheap trick to try to scare us.
- Perhaps you would like other evidence.
- No. That's enough.
Terry, wait.
I shall expect to see you with the sword and mask
- at the shop of Goy Lo Sung.
- Where is that?
In the street of the dragon, half a league to the north.
Otherwise, I'm afraid if your father does return, he may not be in the best of health.
- Where are those things?
- Oh, Sheila, we can't.
- Where are they?
- Wait a minute, dear.
Don't you see it's betraying the whole expedition?
- I'm going to that place.
- Oh, you couldn't. You can't.
Oh, Terry, don't you see?
If it were someone you loved. My father, who'd do anything for you.
- I know, dear. But listen to...
- Terry, if you won't go, I'll go myself.
You can't let them do this to him. You can't let him suffer.
We'll get the sword back somehow. Nayland will manage.
Nayland would do this himself. Anyone would.
You mustn't say a word to Nayland.
- But you are going?
- Yes.
- You're Fu Manchu?
- Please sit down so that we can enjoy your visit.
Now, tell me.
What can one so poor as
Dr. Fu Manchu do for you?
You know why I'm here.
This is the sword and mask of Genghis Khan.
Your messenger said that if I brought you these, you'd release Sir Lionel.
Release? Why, my dear young friend,
Sir Lionel is my guest, not my prisoner.
But if I could see the sword and mask.
Genghis Khan.
What are you going to do?
No.
- You trick Fu Manchu?
- That's the sword we found in the tomb.
Lies, you cursed son of a white dog! I'll flay you for this!
I tell you, I didn't know. Those relics were found in the tomb.
- The whips!
- Listen to me!
I tell you, I didn't know that sword was a fake.
I swear to you I didn't.
The whips!
Faster! Faster!
Faster! Faster!
Faster! Faster!
Let him down.
Untie him.
Follow me.
He is not entirely unhandsome, is he, my father?
For a white man, no.
May I suggest, however, a slight delay in your customary procedure?
- You have further need of him?
- I have.
He shall still be the means of discovering for me where they have hidden the sword and mask.
And for that purpose
- you will...
- Precisely.
I can't stand this. I don't see why they're not here.
- Patience, my dear. We must wait.
- I won't wait. I can't.
I can't imagine where Terry's gone.
Sheila, you sure you don't know?
I've told you I don't know.
- I don't believe you.
- Nayland.
I'm sorry, Sheila, but why don't you tell me the truth?
I can't.
No! Let me go to him.
My father. Let me go!
No! No, let me go.
I gave her enough of this so she'll sleep till morning.
She should have told me.
- I might have saved her father.
- Why did Fu kill him?
Reprisal.
He found out that the other sword was a counterfeit.
- It was a fake?
- Yes.
I had it made from an old engraving
I found in the British Museum.
That's why I left at a later date.
I intended to use those relics to buy Sir Lionel from Fu Manchu.
- I would have brought him back alive.
- What will he do to Terry?
Nothing, just now.
He realizes that I have the genuine sword.
You changed them the night McLeod was killed.
Yes.
Sheila said that Terry had gone to the Bazaar of Goy Lo Sung.
As I remember, that's the sing-song shop in a place known as the House of Ten Thousand Joys.
- You are going there?
- Yes.
I'm sure that it leads to Fu Manchu.
And, Von Berg, if I don't return in 24 hours, you take that mask and sword and Sheila to Peking.
And don't come looking for me.
And don't pay any attention to anything you hear about me or from me till I get back.
And don't you let her out of your sight.
I understand. Good luck, my friend.
I'm going to need it if I meet Fu Manchu.
See something? Here.
Here.
Ming Dynasty.
Ming. Ming.
- Too small.
- Small?
More big? I get.
No.
What I really want is a little comfort. A little rest.
Pleasant dreams, perhaps?
No. No can do. Not for white man.
Understand. Honorable.
Follow me. Come.
Come.
Come.
Nice bed, sir.
Waiter.
You can load? Nicely dream.
The slightest move will send a bullet crashing through your stiff British spine.
Are you in the habit of shooting your enemies in the back?
Put your gun away.
You may turn around.
Now, that's better.
Now we can talk like gentlemen.
- Now, what do you want?
- You know what I want.
I want Terry Granville, and I want him alive.
- Really?
- Where is he?
At the moment, he's being entertained by my beautiful daughter.
Rot!
Would you like to see him? Talk to him?
- Yes.
- Permit me.
Is this a friend of your family's?
It's not wise to insult your host, Sir Nayland.
If it were not the easy way out, I would kill you now.
If you please.
No. Permit me.
My most modest daughter.
Sir Nayland Smith of the
British Secret Service.
- Terry, Terry.
- Nayland.
- What have you done to this boy?
- Practically nothing, as yet.
What are you going to do to him?
Merely inject a drop of serum into his blood.
- That will either kill him or drive him mad?
- Neither.
The injection of the serum will make his brain mine.
In other words, he becomes a reflection of my will.
He will do as I command exactly as though I were doing it.
- So much better than hypnotism.
- I see.
Another of your Oriental tricks.
In the name of the British government,
I demand the release of this boy.
British government?
I will wipe them and the whole accursed white race off the face of the earth when I get the sword and mask that will call the teaming millions of Asia to the uprising.
- And he will bring them to me.
- You'll never make him do that.
Wait and see.
Why, my dear Sir Nayland Smith,
I will show you the sword myself just before I dispatch you to your cold, saintly Christian paradise.
See that he is quite comfortable, for the present.
Sorry to have kept you waiting.
- I'm not afraid of your poisons.
- Not poison.
This serum, distilled from dragon's blood, my own blood, the organs of different reptiles, and mixed with the magic brew of the sacred seven herbs, will temporarily change you into the living instrument of my will.
You will do as I command.
I am only going to give you the very smallest amount which will pass off in a short time, because I want you to be your very self when I hand you over to my gentle daughter.
You will think as I think, see as I see, and do as I command.
Doctor!
Dr. Von Berg.
Dr. Von Berg.
- Who is it?
- It's I, Terrence. Open the door.
Come in.
Oh, Terry.
Terry, my darling, I thought you were never coming back.
What have they done to you? You look so tired.
I'm all right. I'm all right.
I'm back. I'm here.
Terry, dear, you seem dazed, as if you'd been drugged.
Terry.
What?
Where's Sir Nayland? What about him?
He's all right. He's waiting for us in Nankow.
- Nankow?
- But you must get into bed, Terry.
- You need sleep, dear.
- No.
No, we must leave at once.
He's waiting for us.
- He wants us to bring the mask and sword.
- He? Who? You mean Nayland?
Yes. Yes, he's taking us to Peking. Tonight.
Oh, that's impossible. He would never leave in this storm.
He says we must leave.
He says the storm gives us our best chance.
But, Terry, why didn't
Nayland come with you?
- Yes, he told us to wait.
- He's preparing a secret escort to Peking.
That's why he sent me.
He says we're to bring only the mask and sword.
Well, he must know what he's doing.
Sheila, you go and get dressed.
- We leave at once.
- No.
Close that door. Keep Terry here.
I can't explain it,
- but there's something I'm afraid of.
- Afraid of what?
I don't know. This just isn't Terry.
Of course it's Terry.
Come on, get dressed,
Sheila. Come on, Terry.
Terry. Hold it, listen to me.
You're not yourself.
I know you're not.
Oh, please, don't go tonight, I beg of you. Wait until morning.
- He can't wait. Come on.
- No.
- No, Terry. I'm afraid of you.
- Come on.
I don't understand. Terry. I'm afraid. I don't understand you, Terry.
You're all changed. Please, I'm not going. I tell you, I won't go.
Come on, Terry.
He wants you, Terry. Go on.
He's waiting for you. Go on.
- There it is.
- Give it to me.
Oh, don't.
- Stop.
- Yeah.
Doctor.
Doctor!
Terry.
Look, Sheila, that isn't Terry.
- It's an evil spirit.
- He's possessed. Possessed.
Fu Manchu, I want to tell you that the British government...
Silence!
It is my pleasure to show you how I entertain my guests.
You, Miss Barton, will be taken to the room of the golden peacock, where you will be prepared for a sacrifice to our Gods.
And you... You, my dear
Doctor, will follow my slaves to the room of the slim silver fingers, where I am sure you will be more than comfortable.
And at sunrise tomorrow, as my chieftains are assembled in the temple below, you two and your compatriot,
Sir Nayland Smith, will have the pleasure of entering your Christian heaven together.
It will be your honor to be the first white martyrs to perish at the hands of the new Genghis Khan.
I congratulate you.
Listen, you...
Terrence, do something. Help,
Sheila. Help! Do something.
You hideous yellow monster.
You've got your cursed sword and mask. What more can you want of us?
- Do you want to destroy us all?
- Yes.
This is only the beginning. I will wipe out your whole accursed white race.
Oh, no. Terry!
Terry. Look at me. Listen to me.
It's Sheila. It's
Sheila talking to you.
I love you, Terry. You've been sick.
You've been through a bad dream. A bad dream, Terry.
But you're going to waken.
You're going to waken now.
My darling, they can't hurt you.
You belong to me. You're mine. I love you, Terry.
Put your arms around me. Put your arms around me, Terry.
Darling.
Sheila, Sheila.
Sheila.
You silly little fool. Lying to yourself. Believing that you had his love, when he was only drugged by this beast!
- You failed. Both of you.
- Take them away.
You... Listen, Sheila, I know what they did to me.
I love you. Always remember that. I love you.
At the third stroke of the gong, have the slaves take her to the temple.
- Great honor is yours, Miss Barton.
- I am ready.
Oh, my child, you must not be impatient.
Great as I am about to become,
I still cannot hasten the course of the sun.
- Will it be soon?
- Very soon.
From here I shall go to the altar, where, if the Gods are good, the divine image of Genghis Khan will hand me his sword as a sign that I am his true successor.
And am I to be allowed to see my friends again?
I am afraid you would not entirely enjoy what you saw.
- Is Terrence...
- It seems that my daughter has conceived a romantic interest in this young man.
She's having him taken to the laboratory to await further injections of that interesting serum, which, as you may have noticed, will make him her more-than-willing slave, until, of course, she tires of him.
Men of Asia, our skies are red with the thunderbolts of Genghis Khan.
They rain down on the white race and burn them.
The sacrifice to our Gods!
Would you all have maidens like this for your wives?
- Yes!
- Yes!
Then conquer and breed.
Kill the white man and take his women.
Give us the sign!
Our war eagles scream.
The splendor of the world is yours.
Here it is, and that's the machine.
See what's beneath it.
Von Berg, this should send out a million volts.
It will. I saw it.
Terry, you hurry. Get to Sheila.
We'll cover you with this.
In the blood of Shiva's bride,
I baptize this sword.
Are you sure it's necessary, Nayland?
Father would so much have wanted to have it in the museum.
I'm very sorry, my dear.
As much as I respect your father's memory, we can't afford to take any chances.
There may be other Fu
Manchus in the future.
By golly, after all that's happened,
I wouldn't be surprised to see the hand of that fellow Fu Manchu get out of the ocean and grab it.
I don't think there's much danger of that.
Well, Genghis Khan, wherever you are, here's your...
Did you hear it?
Dinner is served. Dinner is served.
- Good evening.
- Good evening, sir.
You aren't, by any chance, a doctor of philosophy?
Law?
- Medicine?
- I don't think so, sir.
But are you sure?
Oh, yes, very sure.
- I congratulate you.
- Thank you.
Dinner is served. Dinner is served.
Well, as I was saying, wherever you are, Genghis Khan,
I give you back your sword.
[Dramatic instrumental music]
[Slow instrumental music]
[Talking in Tibetan]
[Shouting in Tibetan]
- What will you do if they won't go?
- Go on alone, of course.
[Arguing in Tibetan]
[Bell ringing]
[All shouting in Tibetan]
Pax vobiscum, my sons.
Et cum spiritu tuo.
FATHER: You're both English, are you not?
WILFRED: Yes.
You're the first white man we've seen in three months.
You two are the first I've seen in 40 years.
My name is Glendon.
This is my assistant, Hugh Renwick.
We're botanists.
HUGH: He's a botanist. I'm a nobody he brought along out of kindness.
HUGH: I wanted to see the last places on earth.
Why are you here?
We're looking for the Mariphasa lupina lumina... a strange flower which grows only in Tibet... and which, it is said, takes its life from the moon.
HUGH: Is there really such a flower, Father?
There are some things it is better not to bother with.
Why do you say that, Father?
- You aren't afraid, are you?
- No.
But I respect some of the superstitions of others.
Often they are founded in fact.
HUGH: Our coolies tell us, the valley we want to see is filled with demons.
WILFRED: Yes, I'm afraid they thought you were one of them.
That's why they ran away.
I've never been into that valley... and I've never known a man to return from it.
Then we were right. This is the place.
According to this map, it's just beyond that ridge... just off the trail.
- Are you game?
- Wish us luck, Father.
- Get the ponies.
- Right.
You are foolish... but without fools there would be no wisdom.
FATHER: Pax vobiscum.
WILFRED: Thank you, Father.
[Adventurous instrumental music]
Think of all the trouble we've been through these past six months... just for the sake of a little flower.
Yes. But it's the only one of its kind in the whole world.
We're going to go on climbing.
HUGH: I say, Glendon!
WILFRED: What?
I can't move! Something's holding my feet!
Nonsense. Lift them. Come on.
[Wolf howling]
- Are you all right now?
- I seem to be.
- What was the matter?
- I don't know.
It's the strangest feeling.
The sort you have in a dream.
Your feet won't move.
Don't let it get you, old boy.
Autosuggestion, self-hypnosis:
The basis of all superstition.
[Wolf continues howling]
[Wilfred groaning in pain]
What happened?
Something struck me.
[Tense instrumental music]
[Dramatic instrumental music]
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
[Werewolf groaning]
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
[Slow instrumental music]
[Mechanical hissing]
Wilfred, what are you doing?
Sorry, dear. I lost all track of time.
Everybody's asking for you.
I've been working on an experiment.
What's the matter? Is something wrong? I mean, am I all right?
Dear old bear.
Nothing interests you anymore... except your mouldy old secrets in there.
Not even your wife.
I promise you, my darling... that as soon as I've completed that experiment...
I'll try to be more... Well, more human.
It isn't in you.
Ever since you came back from Tibet...
I've felt you were planning to divorce me and marry a laboratory.
I'll not only divorce you, but I'll beat you as well... if ever again you get me mixed up in a mess like this.
Don't blame me. Blame the Botanical Society.
I know, but I...
Here's Aunt Ettie. Let's get out... or she'll be battering down the doors. I'll have no secrets left.
Wilfred, how sweet of you to let us all in on you today this way.
Can you really make artificial moonlight?
I can't wait until I see your new laboratory.
Deadline, Aunt Ettie.
He won't even let me go in there.
Oh, Chanel. Sweet.
But you look a bit down.
What's the matter, Lisa?
My dear wife has just been scolding me.
Yes, how you manage to keep your dear wife is a mystery to me.
Skirmishing off the way you do.
Leaving her alone, months on end.
Anyhow, I knew the risk I took when I married... one of the black Glendons of Malvern.
Marrying any man is risky.
Marrying a famous man is kissing catastrophe.
Come on, Wilfred. See you later, Aunt Ettie.
Good heavens!
What is that wicked thing doing?
It trapped that poor, dear little fly.
It's going to eat that poor, dear little fly.
How revolting.
I wonder where is that horrible Madagascar plant?
The one that eats mice and men.
Mice and spiders, Miss Ettie.
It's over there. Shall we take a look?
- They'll be feeding it soon.
- No. I'll have my own tea first.
I may lose it after I've seen the thing... but I shall have it anyway.
Please don't yank me, Paul.
It irritates me to be yanked.
I'm sorry, Granny.
But I've just seen someone
I want to speak to. There she is.
ETTIE: Alice, darling.
ALICE: Oh, my dear, how are you?
- Do you know Mr. Renwick?
- How do you do?
- Mr...
- How do you do, Ames?
I must have my tea, quick.
My tongue is hanging out.
You do pick up the oddest phrases, don't you, Ettie?
I got that one from your delightful grandson here.
You take Lady Forsythe. I'll take Capt...
- Ames.
- Of course.
I never knew anyone... who could scuttle about as quickly as Ettie Coombes can.
ETTIE: Lisa.
Here's a young man who says he used to be a beau of yours.
Paul! I read you were in England.
LISA: I wondered if...
PAUL: Lisa, how great to see you again.
I simply adore to travel. Simply adore it.
He used to be a beau of hers.
I say, you've got a lovely garden here.
Haven't we?
I simply jitter to go to Java. Simply jitter.
Yes.
"Simply jitter to go to Java.
"I simply jitter to go to Java."
Wilfred, I want you to meet a very dear friend, Paul Ames.
How do you do, sir?
Mrs. Glendon and I used to throw jam in each other's hair as kids... and sail off the stable roof on improvised parachutes.
I've heard about your more recent exploits, as everyone has.
My wife never told me that she knew you.
- We've known one another for ages.
- Yes, quite a time.
Oh, yes. He proposed to her once.
When I was six, and he was twelve.
That was ages ago.
Are you planning on staying in England long?
No. I return to California on the fourth.
I've made my home there.
How does it feel to have a flying school of one's own?
To be able to hop across from San Francisco to Tokyo... in the twinkling of an eye?
At this moment, I ask nothing more of life.
Really?
A very enchanting mood to be in:
To ask nothing more of life.
Are you in that mood, Lisa?
Anyway, I'm in that mood.
All these lovely flowers about.
How true. Only God can make a daffodil.
The poet said, "Only God can make a tree," Aunt Ettie.
Isn't it just as difficult to make a daffodil, Wilfred?
Much more so.
Here's a nice, fat frog for you, my dear Carnelia. Here we are.
Ettie Coombes, what's happened?
- A plant just ate a frog.
- A what?
- A what?
- Frog.
Heretic! Bringing a beastly thing like that into Christian England.
Nature is very tolerant, sir.
She has no creeds.
Quite so.
May I congratulate you, sir... on the amazing collection of plants you've assembled here.
Thank you.
Evolution was in a strange mood...
- when that creation came along.
- Yes.
It makes one wonder... just where the plant world leaves off... and the animal world begins.
WILFRED: Have I met you before, sir?
In Tibet, once. But only for a moment...
- in the dark.
- In the dark?
Let me introduce myself again.
DR. YOGAMl: I am Dr. Yogami.
WILFRED: How do you do, sir?
Like yourself, a student, a nurturist of plants.
WILFRED: Dr. Yogami.
Pardon?
Do I understand you to say, that we met in Tibet?
Yes.
And unless I'm mistaken, we were both on a similar mission.
Yes?
Would it be intrusive if I should ask you...
- if you were successful?
- In what?
In obtaining a specimen... of the Mariphasa lumina lupina:
The phosphorescent wolf flower.
Well, you know... it blooms only under the rays of the moon.
My specimens died on the journey back.
As a scientist, sir, as a botanist... you actually believe that this flower...
- takes its life from moonlight?
- I do.
So far I've been unsuccessful... in persuading mine to bloom by moonlight... or any other kind of light.
Let me see them.
I'm very sorry.
I'll have to ask you to excuse me.
May I go along with you?
Lee!
- You'll pardon me?
- Of course.
No one's called me Lee for years.
So what's happened to you?
You were the gayest, happiest creature in the world once.
What's happened to you?
I have a toothache today.
I never seem to be able to rise above a toothache.
It makes me want to howl, break things... pull noses, tweak ears, screech.
Yes, you were always a good screecher as a child.
But I'll say this for you, you were truthful.
I'd hate to see you turn into a liar.
Liar?
Yes, it isn't a toothache that's troubling you today.
Won't you tell an old pal how to help?
How?
- Shut up.
- I see.
It's been great seeing you.
Now I'd better go and find Wilfred.
He's probably looking everywhere for me.
I can't bear to see you change like this.
You, who used to rear at the drop of a hat.
A wild pair we were, weren't we?
High-headed, hard at the bit, quick with the heels.
How we used to fight. Remember?
Yes. Where's all that lovely fight gone?
There's been no fight in me since the night we broke things off.
This flower is an antidote for what?
Werewolfery.
Lycanthrophobia is the medical term... for the affliction I speak of.
And do you expect me to believe that a man so affected... actually becomes a wolf... under the influence of the full moon?
No.
The werewolf is neither man nor wolf... but a satanic creature, with the worst qualities of both.
[Chuckling]
I'm afraid, sir, that I gave up my belief in goblins, witches... personal devils, and werewolves... at the age of six.
But that does not alter the fact... that in workaday, modern London today... at this very moment... there are two cases of werewolfery known to me.
[Dramatic instrumental music]
And how did these unfortunate gentlemen... contract this medieval unpleasantness?
From the bite of another werewolf.
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
These men are doomed but for this flower... the Mariphasa.
LISA: There you are, Wilfred.
- Your wife?
- Yes.
This is my wife. Dr. Yogami.
How do you do?
May I visit your conservatories again one day?
- Of course, yes.
- Thank you.
What a strange man.
Yes.
See, man. See that moon vine.
That only blooms at night.
If I've deceived that vine, surely I can deceive Mariphasa!
I don't know, sir.
I got a feeling that Mariphasa ain't a human plant, sir... not like this vine.
Look.
Look, man!
What did I tell you?
And these two buds should bloom before tonight.
[Tense instrumental music]
WILFRED: Hawkins, go and get your dinner.
HAWKINS: Dinner, sir?
Go. Get out. You make me nervous.
Don't stand there staring at me all solemn and owl-eyed.
Yes, sir. Certainly.
[Tense instrumental music continues]
Of course, Mr. Plympton, you being a mere indoor person... has no idea of the mysteries of nature.
Most interesting, what you've been telling me, Mr. Hawkins.
And so them rings make moonlight, do they?
You have the idea, Mr. Plympton, in a manner of speaking.
Not that it's easy to grasp.
But there's a very scary thought, if you come to consider it.
Yes? And what might that be?
It don't leave nothing for heaven to do.
Quite so.
If you please, not on the glass, thank you.
Now, perhaps, you'll be good enough to go and tell Dr. Glendon... the missus is hoping he'll come in for tea.
Not a chance, I assure you, of his coming.
- Not a chance, Mr. Hawkins?
- Not a chance, Mr. Plympton.
Upstart.
Did you speak, Mr. Hawkins?
I did, Mr. Plympton, but not to you.
LISA: More tea?
PAUL: No, thanks.
- No, thank you.
- No, dear.
I have to get back to London before the evening traffic starts.
I'll never forgive you, Lisa, if you don't come to my party tonight.
Everyone in the world will be there.
Definitely everyone in the world.
I'd love to come... but it's impossible to get Wilfred to go anywhere.
Forget Wilfred.
Why don't you invite Paul to stay on for dinner?
And let him drive you into town afterwards.
- Yes, why don't you?
- I do.
I stay.
Ettie, dear, how did you find your new home?
I happened on it district visiting.
ETTIE: Come, darling.
Queen Elizabeth stayed there one night.
It's right on the river, in the midst of the sweetest slums.
So individual: Murderer's dens on one side, pubs on the other.
Is your party buffet or sit-down?
Buffet. The house is too small for sit-down.
How I loathe buffets.
Last week at Eva Trippet's...
I sat on a plate of salad, and no one told me.
What's the matter with you? Stop it.
PLYMPTON: Dr. Yogami.
[Dog barking]
LISA: How do you do?
Is Dr. Glendon at home?
My husband is working on an experiment. He can't see anyone.
- Perhaps I can see him later?
- I'm afraid not.
Lisa, who is this interesting-looking man?
Introduce him to me at once.
Dr. Yogami, my aunt, Miss Coombes.
- How do you do?
- I noticed you... at the botanical garden party and wondered who you were.
You must come to my party tonight.
Just a free and easy musical at my little bandbox in the slums.
Thank you, but I'm far too busy a man for pleasure.
Nonsense. Very busy men come to my parties.
Positively the busiest.
Lady Forsythe is bringing her son.
Could you find a busier man in all London... than the Chief of Scotland Yard?
ALICE: Time to scuttle, Ettie.
I must go. I'll see you tonight, Dr. Yokohama.
[Alarm buzzing]
Dr. Yogami, didn't they tell you that I wasn't seeing anyone today?
I thought, perhaps, you might see me.
- Come another day, please.
- Another day would be too late.
What will happen before morning,
I cannot say.
Tonight is the first night of the full moon.
Still harping on that old wives' tale of yours?
Would it were an old wives' tale.
Exactly what do you want of me?
Two blossoms of the Mariphasa flower in there...
- would save two souls tonight.
- Tonight?
But I thought you said the Mariphasa was a cure.
No. An antidote.
Effective only for a few hours.
Won't you let me see the results of your experiment?
Sorry. When my experiments are completed...
I will show the results to the entire world.
Not before.
Now, sir, I must wish you good day.
DR. YOGAMl: Then there is nothing more to be said?
Nothing.
Good day.
But remember this, Dr. Glendon.
The werewolf instinctively seeks to kill... the thing it loves best.
[Dramatic instrumental music]
[Slow instrumental music]
[Knocking at door]
Come in.
LISA: We're leaving now, Wilfred.
WILFRED: We?
I know it's a little early... but Paul wants to stop at his flat and change.
Had you planned on getting home?
PAUL: Naturally, I shall get Lee back.
WILFRED: Yes, of course. Thank you.
Darling, won't you change your mind and come with us?
WILFRED: I listened to all the childhood memories...
I care to hear for one night.
WILFRED: Run along, dear.
Run along and enjoy yourself.
I want you to see what I've done with that brocade you brought me.
Put off those beastly lights, I tell you!
Wilfred, what on earth's the matter?
Sorry, darling. I've been putting some medicine in my eyes... and the lights hurt them.
I just wanted you to see my coat.
WILFRED: Some other time, please.
LISA: Good night, Wilfred.
WILFRED: Good night.
PAUL: Good night, Dr. Glendon.
WILFRED: Good night, sir.
WILFRED: Lisa.
[Soft instrumental music]
Good night, my darling.
[Clock chiming]
[Sombre instrumental music]
[Growling ferociously]
[Tense instrumental music]
[Tense instrumental music continues]
[Lntense instrumental music]
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
[Growling]
[Singing] Scenes that are brightest
May charm
awhile
Hearts which are brightest
And eyes that smile
Lisa! Get off my train!
I hate it when I step on a train.
I shall take you home in a minute.
- Alice, my dear.
- Oh, my dear.
How amazing of you to succeed in bringing your son.
She's singing Scenes That Are Brightest.
She sings Botticelli divinely.
One doesn't sing Botticelli. One paints him.
Oh, yes. I forgot for the moment.
Lisa, dear. Charming. Paul, so good of you.
You two deep men should know each other.
Col. Forsythe, this is Dr. Yokohama.
FORSYTHE: We've met somewhere.
Yes.
[Tense instrumental music]
Don't you just love moonlight,
Dr. Yokohama?
Makes everything so peaceful.
Isn't it romantic to have the Thames lapping at your very threshold?
Sings me to sleep every night, positively.
That's the worst district in London over there.
Knife you for a shilling, positively.
But what difference?
I always say, everything is fate.
Don't you agree with me?
[Werewolf howling]
What's that?
A lost soul perhaps.
[Howling continues]
Let's go in.
What is it, Hugh?
Just a dog, out for a little or no good.
It isn't a dog. It's a lost soul.
[Ettie laughing]
I think we'd better get her upstairs, don't you?
My aunt is feeling a little ill, Dr. Yogami.
You know, you're a naughty girl.
Ettie Coombes, what's the matter with you?
One shouldn't drink at one's own parties.
But I get so nervous.
Ettie Coombes, you should go on the water wagon.
Now, you come along to bed.
PAUL: Don't worry. You'll be perfectly all right in the morning.
I'm so nervous. I want to lie down.
PAUL: Nothing to be nervous of.
LISA: Here we are.
Get to bed. You'll be okay in the morning.
ETTIE: I've been so frightened.
LISA: Open the window.
Yes, of course I will. Air will do her good.
Do you know she's nearly asleep now?
Come on. Let's go.
[Werewolf howling]
What's that horrible sound? What is it?
Well, if I were back on the ranch...
I'd say it was a coyote with a bad dream.
But in London, I don't know.
[Howling continues]
Can't tell me that's a dog.
You are quite right. It isn't a dog.
GUEST: I say, you're trembling.
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
[Panting]
[Suspenseful instrumental music continues]
[Screaming]
PAUL: All right, I'll go.
Don't go up there, Mrs. Glendon.
Don't let any of the women come upstairs.
Just a moment. If you'll all stand back.
[Ettie continues screaming]
PAUL: What's the matter in here?
What's wrong?
The devil's been here. He had green eyes.
He clawed at me. He was covered with hair.
There, there. You've had a bad nightmare, that's all.
If anyone dares to tell me
I've been dreaming...
I shan't answer for the consequences.
Nobody will.
Come along.
You'll be much better if you sit down.
You sit down here. You'll be all right.
My wicked worldliness has caught up with me at last.
The Babu of Goroka always said it would.
There. Never mind.
I'm not here in my official capacity... but I think I can say with conviction... that no devil or any man has come through this window tonight.
Yes. I think our hostess has been mixing her drinks.
That's a very excellent deduction.
A horrible feeling. I've been like it myself.
We all do it at times.
It's getting quite late.
The party must be over.
Shall we have one before we go?
FORSYTHE: I'll have one.
- Lee, I'll wait for you.
- All right.
PAUL: Can I drop you anywhere?
[Tense instrumental music]
[Werewolf grunting]
[Sombre instrumental music]
- Anything else, sir?
- Nothing.
This flower looks to have slipped off and died on its own.
Whatever is it, sir?
I've never seen nothing like it.
Let that flower alone!
I meant no harm, sir.
It's only that I'm so fond of flowers... my fingers always want to touch them.
I'm sorry, Millie.
Here. Take these and buy yourself a pot of primroses or something.
Thank you, sir.
Go on, Jenkins. You heard the cries... and you ran in the direction from which they came.
Yes, sir. And bloodcurdling they was.
I took off as fast as anybody could... that was suffering from broken arches.
Broken arches acquired in the line of duty, sir.
It was some minutes before you located the fatality?
Good morning. I'm a little early.
FORSYTHE: No. Did you see the papers?
PAUL: No.
Just read this.
Go on, Jenkins.
At Goose Lane, me arches crack, and I come a cropper.
- Go on.
- Then I see what I see.
My stomach takes such a turn, my arches crack again.
Goose Lane.
This thing must have happened near Miss Ettie's house.
FORSYTHE: Yes, quite near.
There were wounds on the girl's throat... a wild animal might have made.
Well, if that wasn't a wolf I heard baying last night, I'm crazy.
You know, our dear Aunt Ettie... may not have mixed her drinks as badly as we thought.
In view of this occurrence...
I'm inclined to wonder myself whether there's any connection.
But whatever Miss Coombes saw, it wasn't a wolf.
No. Not in London. You may be sure of that.
I see I can't help you.
But I've only one other brilliant suggestion to make.
How about a werewolf then?
This is Scotland Yard, my boy, not Grimm's Fairy Tales.
"There are more things in heaven and Earth, Horatio." You know.
It's a funny thing. When I was flying in Yucatán last year...
- the authorities went cuckoo over...
- Who?
I beg your pardon, sir.
I mean, the authorities were gravely concerned... with a series of murders, not unlike this one... and they were always preceded by the howling of a wolf.
And then one night... they shot something slinking through the hills... and the murders ceased.
- They said it was a werewolf.
- Who were they?
All right.
But if any more of your citizens are found stark and cold... just remember, nephew warned you.
I think I might be able to persuade
Wilfred to go, too. Yes.
Anyhow I'll expect you, Paul.
Dinner at 8:00. Goodbye.
LISA: Good morning, Wilfred.
WILFRED: Good morning, dear.
LISA: I've just been talking to Paul.
LISA: He suggests that we all go for a moonlight ride tonight.
I'm sorry. I can't go.
There's something wrong, darling.
Very, very wrong.
Why do you say that?
Won't you tell me what it is?
Nothing. I shall be all right.
I wish we could burn that wretched laboratory... and everything in it.
LISA: Darling, you're not happy.
I know when you used to work... you were single-tracked and absorbed.
LISA: But you were thrilled, excited.
Now something about you frightens me.
Lisa, you mustn't say such things.
You're short-tempered with me now.
You never used to be.
You seem to have found someone sufficiently pleasant... to make up for it.
You're being utterly hateful.
I'm sorry.
Just bear with me a little while longer.
You really want me to go on that ride tonight?
- Lf you only knew how much.
- All right, then. I'll go.
I do love you, Lisa.
You know that, don't you?
Hawkins.
Yes, sir. Coming, sir.
You called, sir?
Hawkins, I've got to get away for tonight.
I want you to watch over things very carefully.
Yes, sir. I promise you, no more flowers will be stolen.
That I can and will promise you, sir.
But this bud, sir.
The moon lamp, it don't seem to bring it out, does it?
No.
Well, sir, the real moon will be out in a couple of hours.
Maybe that'll bring it out all right, sir.
That'll be too late, Hawkins.
That'll be too late.
WILFRED: I want you to keep the moon ray going.
HAWKINS: Yes, sir. Certainly, sir.
Wilfred, we'll have to hurry... if we want to see the moon rise over the Downs.
I can't go.
I've to go down to Leicestershire for a few days to see Bransby.
I'm sorry, sir.
I've just had a wire from him about a shipment of bulbs from Burma.
Can't you put it off until tomorrow, and ride tonight?
I can't. And you're not to go riding, either.
What?
- I forbid it, do you hear?
- Forbid it?
I can't have my wife gallivanting around the country... in the moonlight, with a total stranger.
Hardly that, Dr. Glendon.
I planned to ride, Wilfred, and I intend to ride.
Very well. If you must... then promise me that you'll get back before the moon rises.
Promise me that.
I'll promise you nothing of the sort.
I shall ride tonight, tomorrow night, the next night... in fact, every night there's a moon.
Come, Paul.
WILFRED: Don't go.
LISA: Of course I'm going.
[Lively tune playing on piano]
- Here's to you, Mrs. Moncaster.
- And here's to you, Mrs. Whack.
That's the first I've had today.
- How's your son, dearie?
- He's doing splendid.
Did I tell you he was a foreman in a pants factory?
- No.
- Yes.
And the warden says he's the best prisoner he's ever had... in the penitentiary.
I always knew that boy would amount to something.
Is your tripe tough, Mrs. Moncaster?
- Not at all.
- Mine is.
It ain't tripe you're eating. It's your veil.
Oh, Lord.
I want two gins for two ladies.
Two ladies?
Where's the other lady?
Man, what's the matter with your sight?
I'm the both of them.
I beg your pardon.
Could you tell me of anyone in this neighbourhood with rooms to let?
Try Mrs. Moncaster in there... the lady with the feathers, eating the plate of tripe.
- Thank you.
- He seems to have a secret sorrow.
Which one of you ladies has rooms?
I have. And most reasonable.
Three shillings a week for a gentleman.
And the rooms is splendid.
Don't you pay attention to the lying old hypocrite, sir.
Now, my rooms is...
That's my dearest friend, Mrs. Whack.
But she don't understand the ethics of business.
Now, are your intentions by the night or by the week?
- I'll take the room by the week.
- Then this way, sir.
It's just across the court.
Right here. This way.
If you'll follow me, sir.
It's going to be a fine night after all.
I do hate taking my plumes out in the wet.
Are you a single gentleman, sir?
WILFRED: Singularly single, madam.
More single than I ever realised is possible for a human being to be.
You don't say.
WILFRED: What would you say, if I were to tell you that it was possible... for a man to turn into a werewolf?
I'd say I was Little Red Riding Hood.
[Laughing]
There's my gilt and splendid parlour, sir.
You're single, and I'm single.
Ain't that a coincidence?
Ten years I was married to
Moncaster. Ain't seen him in 20.
He run away to Australia.
What a man he was.
Used to come home from his work all portered up... hit the baby with the plate, throw the gravy in the grate... spear the canary with a fork.
MRS. MONCASTER: And with his heavy hobnail boots... black-and-blue me from head to foot... and all because I forgot to have crackling on the pork.
Here's your room, sir.
Don't let this happen to me.
[Sombre instrumental music]
Father in Heaven, don't let this happen to me again.
If it must happen, keep me here.
Keep me away from Lisa.
Keep me away from the thing I love.
[Tense instrumental music]
[Werewolf howling]
[Lntense instrumental music]
Mrs. Moncaster.
Oh, you poor dear.
I'm sorry I hit you, Mrs. Whack.
Say no more about that, Mrs. Moncaster.
What's going on here?
He grips me, swipes me, swats me one in the breadbasket... and slams the door in me face.
Do you call that a gentleman?
I thought perhaps you might want some help. That's why I come in.
Strange noises have been coming from his room, Mrs. Whack.
I don't know what I've let myself in for.
I'd use me passkey and have a look.
Take a peek through the keyhole first.
[Mrs. Whack screaming]
WOMAN: Where have you been?
[Wolf howling]
WOMAN: I've been waiting more than
15 minutes for you to open the gate.
Them wolves have been acting queerly all night.
ALF: Hear them?
WOMAN: Wolves is nothing to me.
Give me a nice kiss, Alf.
[Growling]
I hadn't ought to do this.
Me with a wife and kids.
But you don't love your wife and your kids. You love me.
[Wolf howling]
Them blasted wolves.
What's the matter with them tonight?
What a fool you are.
A young fellow like you... tied to a white-faced, whimpering, scarecrow of a woman.
But you're going to leave her and come with me, ain't you?
Maybe.
[Wolf howling continues]
Wait a minute.
I've got to see what's happening.
[Tense instrumental music]
[Woman screaming]
Why, Mrs. Whack, what keeps you up so late?
I felt I couldn't go to bed, angel... without coming back to see how you was.
I ain't exactly bubbling.
- Is he back?
- Vanished as if he was air.
[Mrs. Whack laughing]
He must have been a hairy man.
I suppose you don't happen to have a nip about you anywhere.
No. Ain't it unfortunate?
[Werewolf howling]
He's back.
How did he get in?
I been sitting here all night.
Better go up and see what he's about now.
Put your eye to the keyhole.
And you keep off my jaw, Mrs. Whack.
MRS. WHACK: Why, Mrs...
[Mrs. Moncaster screams]
MRS. MONCASTER: Mrs. Whack.
MRS. WHACK: What is it?
MRS. MONCASTER: Come here.
Look.
[Mrs. Whack screaming]
Pull yourself together. Come on.
MRS. MONCASTER: I wonder if you saw what I saw... or if I saw what you saw.
MRS. WHACK: And I better run for the police.
No. We've seen something better left unsaid to the police.
- They might say we've been drinking.
- Maybe we have.
By any chance, did you find a bottle?
No, my love.
But if I saw what I thought I saw...
I've had my last bottle.
And it had better be the same with you.
Now, I'm speaking to you as a sister to a sister.
That's right. Now, that's...
[Werewolf howling]
[Both exclaiming]
Let's get inside.
MRS. WHACK: Shut it out.
[Door shuts]
Sorry, Tom.
Nice doings at the zoo.
What does The Herald say?
Usual thing: "What's the matter with Scotland Yard?"
What do the papers think we are?
The eyes that see all?
Old Forsythe's bobbing up and down like a balloon that can't land.
FORSYTHE: And, Evans.
EVANS: Yes, sir.
If I don't get a definite report on both these atrocities by 6:00 p. M...
I promise you, you'll all be seeking new professions by tomorrow morning.
- Good day.
- Good day, sir.
Uncle, this is Dr. Yogami of the University of Carpathia.
FORSYTHE: Sit down.
YOGAMl: Thank you.
FORSYTHE: Ever since the other night,
I've been wondering where I met you.
FORSYTHE: I called on you seven years ago... to enlist the resources of Scotland Yard... for an unfortunate mortal afflicted with lycanthrophobia.
FORSYTHE: Yes. I recall it.
You thought I was mad.
FORSYTHE: What can we do for you now?
Your department is trying to solve two murders.
There will be other murders tonight, and tomorrow night.
Also next month, when the moon is full again... unless you realise, sir, there is a werewolf abroad in London.
Yes, my nephew has similar ideas.
FORSYTHE: What do you want us to do about it?
You must seize the only specimen of the Mariphasa plant in England.
FORSYTHE: And where shall I get this posy?
In the private laboratory of Dr. Wilfred Glendon.
That flower is the only known antidote for werewolfery.
Yes, a very interesting folktale... but of no value to the police.
I warn you, sir... unless you secure this plant... and discover the secret of nurturing it in this country... there'll be an epidemic... that will turn London into a shambles.
FORSYTHE: We'll take precautions for the protection of London.
FORSYTHE: There is a wolf wandering about, but not the supernatural one.
FORSYTHE: That, I think, disposes of our murders.
But that wolf escaped last night.
That wolf will be captured.
But the murder in Goose Lane was two nights ago.
Do not worry about the animal from the zoo.
Whether you catch it or not, will not matter much... tonight.
Why, sir, you give me quite a start, sir.
That one bud, sir, it seems rather stubborn.
It doesn't seem to want to come out, does it, sir?
I'm afraid it's no use, Hawkins.
It will only need another night.
[Tense instrumental music]
Another night?
Why, sir... you look as if it was a matter of life and death, sir.
Perhaps we can speed it up, sir.
At least we can try, can't we?
- You never fail me, do you, Hawkins?
- No, sir.
Listen. I haven't been here.
- You haven't seen me.
- Why, of course not, sir.
I've got to get away. Immediately.
I can't stay here.
I can't stay here with this stubborn Mariphasa.
Why, Mr. Glendon, whatever brings you here?
- I'm spending the night here.
- I am glad, sir.
And my wife will be happy to cook one more supper for you, sir.
I don't want anyone to know that
I'm here. Not even Mrs. Timothy.
I want to be alone. I want to get away from Glendon Manor... away from my work, away from people.
I want to be alone and think.
You've often wanted to be alone and think, haven't you, Timothy?
Yes, sir, but Mrs. Timothy will be awful disappointed, sir.
You know, she's always talking about the old days... when Miss Lisa's mother and father was alive... and you would come courting here.
WILFRED: Hello, old fellow.
You remember me, don't you?
He seems glad to see me, Timothy.
Yes. Beans remembers the old days, too, sir.
Do you know where I'm going to spend the night?
I was thinking of airing out the best room in the west wing, sir.
No, don't do that.
I'm going to the Monk's Rest.
You can't do that, sir.
Why, it ain't been open for years.
Nevertheless, that's where I'm going to spend the night.
You see, Miss Lisa and I, we miss the old times, too.
Thank you, Timothy.
Why, there ain't even a bed, sir.
I shan't need a bed, Timothy.
- You'll be cold, I'm afraid, sir.
- Lf I am, I shall build a fire.
Here's the key, sir.
- Lock me in, Timothy.
- Pardon, sir?
Lock me in. Don't open that door before sunrise.
Even if I call, pay no attention to it.
Keep that door locked till dawn.
Good night.
Good night, sir.
There it is, Paul. You can just see it through the trees.
Dear old Falden.
I couldn't go back to America without one look at it.
Let's get out of the car here and walk.
All right.
PAUL: Lee, I can't tell you how strange it seems coming back here... after all these years.
This is where we used to hunt for birds' eggs. Remember?
And this is where I proposed to you.
Do you remember that?
And then a bumblebee stung you.
How funny you looked.
My dear, I can't tell you how good it is to hear you laugh again.
Lee, I love you so much.
Always have, always will.
Don't say that, Paul.
You promised you wouldn't.
We've been through it all before. It's no use.
[Dramatic instrumental music]
[Tense instrumental music]
But you're horribly, miserably unhappy.
Anyone can see that.
It's you who are making me unhappy, Paul.
Couldn't you care for me again?
I wouldn't tell you if I could.
[Tense instrumental music continues]
I don't know why, Lee... but I'm frightened for you.
Terribly frightened.
Don't be silly.
I can still beat you to the Monk's Tower.
It's on. I'll give you a 10-yard start. Off you go.
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
[Lntense instrumental music]
LISA: I've won!
[Lisa continues screaming]
[Tense instrumental music]
So you've seen this monster before?
Yes. There was something grotesquely familiar about it.
Then it suddenly struck me.
It was Wilfred Glendon.
FORSYTHE: Paul, pull yourself together.
Do you realise what you're accusing Glendon of?
FORSYTHE: A man I've known all his life.
I repeat, sir. I fought with Wilfred Glendon, a werewolf.
FORSYTHE: Where is Mrs. Glendon now?
At home, doors and windows locked.
Miss Coombes is with her.
They promised not to leave the room until I got back.
Very well. I'll go to Glendon Manor in my official capacity.
But I'm going to form my own conclusions...
- from what I see and hear.
- All right.
We've just found another victim of this monstrous murderer:
A chambermaid at the Bedlington Hotel...
- killed some time last night.
- Very well. I'll be over.
There you are. There's your werewolf for you.
Unless it had seven-league boots... it couldn't get to the Bedlington Hotel...
150 miles from Falden Abbey.
I'll tell you what. We'll go to the hotel... and after that, if necessary, we'll go to Glendon Manor.
I think it'll be necessary.
Usual thing. The place smelled like a kennel when we came in.
You can still notice it.
Who occupied the room?
The guest's name was a Dr. Yogami, sir.
FORSYTHE: The same kind of lacerations?
DETECTIVE: Exactly, sir.
FORSYTHE: Yeah.
Look, sir. I just found these in the wastepaper basket.
I've never seen a flower like it before, have you?
No.
Yogami spoke of some rare plant that Glendon had.
This must be it.
Buck up, my boy. You're not such a fool.
We'll drive down to Glendon Manor at once.
PAUL: Right. I'll get my hat.
Dr. Glendon is not at home, sir.
- Was he here last night?
- I think not, sir.
Have you heard from Dr. Glendon?
No, we haven't heard a word from him.
Has Hawkins seen him?
No. He is not in the laboratory.
- Are you all right, Lisa?
- Yes. Don't worry.
Keep your door locked.
No report from the East End, sir.
No report from Yogami's apartment, sir.
We've heard nothing of Dr. Yogami.
Three men at Glendon's. Yes.
No, we're not afraid.
Glendon has not passed through Richmond.
Headquarters. No station reports any trace of Dr. Glendon.
[Knocking at door]
- Dr. Glendon!
- Quiet. Help me up.
The police have been searching everywhere for you.
I know. The Mariphasa, has it bloomed yet?
No, but it's going to bloom.
That'll be all.
You needn't mention you've seen me.
No, sir. Of course not.
[Soft instrumental music]
Yogami! You brought this on me... that night in Tibet.
I'm sorry I can't share this with you.
[Tense instrumental music]
[Grunting]
[Glass shattering]
Relax, Lisa. Relax.
[Werewolf howling]
Quick. Col. Forsythe.
Col. Forsythe has left for Glendon Manor, madam.
[Police siren wailing]
[Tense instrumental music]
[Glass shattering]
[Car horn honking]
[Siren wailing continues]
[Window pane shattering]
It's Lisa. Don't you know me?
Wilfred!
[Gun shot firing]
Thanks for the bullet.
It was the only way.
In a few moments now...
I shall know why all of this had to be.
Lisa, goodbye.
Goodbye, Lisa.
I'm sorry...
I couldn't have made you happier.
[Sentimental instrumental music]
In my report, I shall say... that I shot him by accident... while he was trying to protect his wife.
[Slow instrumental music]
[Dramatic instrumental music]

My father owned a small estate in Nottinghamshire.
I was third of his sons.
In my youth i occupied myself with medicine, after that i sailed for some years as a ship suregon.
Once i sailed on 'Antelope' to South Ocean.
It was stormy weather, big waves washed over deck and deafening wind blew in the sails.
Then I noticed a ship with black sails.
Those were the pirates.
Their fast brig ramed into 'Antelope', the impact was so heavy that i went overdoard and fell on the deck of pirates' ship.
Horrible crash was heard and poor 'Antelope' went down with all its crew.
"By thousand devils!" pirates shouted "All sorts of old boats are slouching around!"
Meanwile the storm...
Boatswain!
Everybody in their places!
Get out, lazybones! To work!
Oh, you, mariners!

(foodstuffs councellors)| To keep a watchful eye on him, but to feed him (food provided by holding company "OhHowTasty"
Agreed on:
Opinons differ.
Kill! Kill! Kill! Immediately!
Bombs! Soldiers! Dynamite! Machine guns! Very cheap!
No, let's start trading in! Gullivers needs food, wine, cloath...
Killed him! Killed him!
Quiet! The king speaks!
I, the great king of lilliputs, my fellow men, live in constant care about your well-being...
Get Gulliver to where he came from!
Stop interrupting the king!
...live cheating the nation, cheating the nation, cheating the nation...
The king has decided.
Gulliver will become our soldier.
Attention! Get ready!
Three, four!
Long live the wise king!
Gulliver is being conveyed!
Wake up Gulliver!
Wake [him] up!
Fire!
His Highness, the king!
Your Higness, be a hero!
What a sneeze!
[Little] men...
Alive!
How small!
Yes, we are placable, but if you will continue to shout so loud king will become angry.
How scary!
Quiet, you! Piano pianissimo! Our drum membranes are bursting!
OK then. Sorry. I won't do that anymore.
Your Highness, pardon him. He's apologising and he won't do that anymore.
Where am i? Who you are?
King will speak now!
We are great, we are mighty, bigger than the sun, higher than the clouds but don't be afraid of our talking, we're very placable folk.
Placable folk?
I don't see any folk, only soldiers.
Soldiers?
Soldiers for making the nature beautiful.
Soldiers for making the folk scared.
Oh, so! Perhaps, you want to [scare] me, too!
Yes, yes, and we accept you as our soldier, too.
Yes, yes, as a soldier.
What?
Me?
As a royal soldier?
No way!
Pipes.
What "pipes"?
He agrees. He wants [to hear] an orchestra.
Let's blow pipes for him!
Comrades! I pronounce this meeting of workers of underground factory open!
Regardless of all, we begin revolt tomorrow!
But what if man-mountain will be fighting for them?
Then he will fall together with them.
Right! We will bring down any mountain.
Comrades, in the box is notebook of man-mountain.
Wonderful. Let's read it and discover what he is.
Exercise-book in russian language of
Petya Konstantinov
Hail to the wise union of workers all around the world!
Unseen show! Feeding of Man-Mountain! Conveyor of food!
1000 cows, 1000 sturgeons, 1000 cooks!
Whole royal court participates in the event. Splendid concert!
King's favourite Fo-Lya conducts the programme.
Baloons! Baloons!
They will fly un to the mountain!
Backup drum membranes!
Natural ???
See for yourself disbelievers!
Here is Gulliver!
Five at a time!
Yeah, that's an appetite!
Just look at [his] mouth!
Folk? Where's folk? Don't let folk!
Don't worry, i've taken the necessary measures.
I find him very suspicious...
Let's try to sidetrack his attention.
And then?
Then to attract his attention.
I announce private concert in honour of our high guest!
Royal corps de ballet!
Do something to amuse him!
In a moment!
Royal dwarfs - microputs.
Dwarfs at your place?
Amazing!
Give [them] closer!
Why do you beat them!
So that they would work better.
Do you beat everybody who works for you?
Don't talk nonsense! We don't...lay our hands on anybody.
I want to know how your folk is living.
Folk?
Please, please...song about how we're living.
Under king's wise guidance earth is in bloom, fields are in bloom and we are singing
Our folk is content with life, it always sings and doesn't expect tears.
...we have no worries, we have no worries.
She's lying!
Lying?
Perhaps, you can sing more veritable?
Let's give it a try.
Horn is blowing, we're youth of the nation, we're growing up in world of labour.
Blow, horn, under the sun of freedom!
Pioneers' star is burning.
Horn is blowing. Fly to distant lands, our call!
Blow, horn, over all oceans flies wave of our songs.
Horn is blowing. We will change the land.
Blow, horn, so that in future world lived free and happy man.
Workers all around the world, rise up!
I haven't received such note yet.
I said: kill him immediately.
Let's do so.
Such petty souls!
Prepare weapons and ammunition to use against Gulliver immediately!
I hear that, mister chief of the police!
These weapons are to be used agains Gulliver...let's warn him.
Let's warn Gulliver.
Let's warn him.
Guys, leave me in peace!
Come on, guys!
Was it you who woke me up?
Quieter, Petya! Spies are around! They can hear us.
How do you know me?
Form your exercize-book.
Oh, native language.
That language is our mother tongue, too.
I'm from workers of underground factory.
Finally! Greetings!
Petya, beware!
[they] want to kill you.
Everything is going well. Ammunition will be prepared.
Excellent.
What? 100? - Little. - 200? - Little. - 300? - Little.
So remeber, be prepared tomorrow.
Always ready!
Come here at once!
Gulliver knows everything.
Workers warned Gulliver.
...bastards!
Here, to me! - I hear.
Catastrophe!
What will we do now?
Poison Gulliver!
And workers? - Workers...
...with machine guns.
Abandon the work!
Riot at military factory!
Workers are occupying arsenal!
Police is in no power to prevent it.
My greetings!
We're celebrating king's birthday.
Let's drink on the health of his highness.
Pioneer...Gulliver doesn't smoke and drink.
But we have such tradition!
Well, if tradition...
He drank it!
It seems he's done.
We've finished off the main man. Now - the rebels.
Secret. To commander of southern squad.
Set bombs all along the battlefront. Retreat to the sea thus luring the enemy onto the minefield.
Blow up bombs at my command. General commander Povstaniev.
Victory! Victory! Tanks have driven rebels to the sea.
Royal fleet is ready to use force.
Blow up the bombs!
It's all over. We're defeated.
God, save the throne.
God, save the labour.
I pronounce open the meeting of free lilliputs!
Well? You're awake, traveller?
Guys, how big you are!
What a big life!
A CHRISTMAS CAROL
Hark! the herald angels sing
"Glory to the newborn King
Peace on earth and mercy mild,
God and sinners reconciled!"
Joyful, all ye nations rise;
Join the triumph of the skies;
With angelic host proclaim
"Christ is born in Bethlehem!"
Hark! the herald angels sing
"Glory to the newborn King!"
MORE THAN A CENTURY AGO...
IN LONDON... ON CHRISTMAS EVE.
Have a try at it.
Coo, governor, that was a slide.
- It was good, wasn't it?
- I should say.
You beat the record, that's what you did.
Did I, now?
Look at Albert.
He fell!
- Don't you like sliding, son?
- Yes, sir. It's great sport.
Come on then.
Try and beat my record.
No, thank you, governor.
I'm not very good at running.
Here. Get up on my back.
We'll show them how to slide.
Thank you, sir.
- What's your name, youngster?
- Tim, sir. Thank you, sir.
- Well, come on, Tim. Here we go.
- Thank you.
We'll really do this slide.
We'll make a record together.
Here we go now!
Hold tight.
There we are.
Wasn't that lovely?
It was wonderful.
It made my stomach all wobbly-like.
- Yes. We're a team, that's what we are.
- I don't suppose you ever fall down.
- Like Albert.
- Fall down?
Who, me? No.
- Well, sir?
- I am sorry, governor.
I didn't mean to hit you, sir.
Please don't be angry with him, sir.
He's my brother.
In that case,
I've only one reason to be angry.
He broke my record.
- What's your name?
- Cratchit, sir. Peter Cratchit.
He's my brother, Tim Cratchit.
- Not Bob Cratchit's sons?
- Why, yes, sir.
I know your father well.
In truth, I was on my way to his place of work when we met.
Maybe he'll take the message for us, Pete.
As you'll be seeing him, sir, you might do me the favor... of giving him this list of things my mother wants him to fetch.
- Certainly.
- It's very nice of you to do that, sir.
Not a bit of it, Peter.
I'm more than willing.
Well, that is jolly.
Don't you two lads want to see your father?
And on Christmas Eve, too?
It ain't that we don't want to see our own father, sir.
It's the man our father works for we don't want to see. Mr. Scrooge.
I don't think he's very fond of small boys, sir.
Yes. I understand.
You see, I knew Mr. Scrooge... when I was a small boy.
He's my uncle.
Come on now, Bob.
Aren't you going to wish me a merry Christmas?
Mr. Fred, I am sorry. When you came in and stood there like that...
I thought it was your uncle.
A merry Christmas, sir.
A merry Christmas to you, Bob, and to your family.
I've already paid my respects to part of your brood.
Peter and Tim, their names were.
They asked me to give you this list from their mother.
Thank you. They shouldn't have made it an errand for you.
I was pleased to do it.
It's cold in here.
You think we could have some coal on the fire?
Oh, yes.
It's against the regulations, isn't it?
Mr. Scrooge doesn't like to waste coal, sir.
I foresaw that and provided for it.
This'll make the place less bleak.
- What might that be?
- It's a wine bottle.
A cheering, warming, goodly wine.
A wine that'll race through your veins... with little torches. It's port, Bob.
The fifth essence of the Christmas spirit.
But we haven't got a glass.
I'll get one from Mr. Scrooge's office.
- What is this?
- Cough medicine.
Yeah, I thought so.
We will.
- We will have some more coal.
- Good man, Bob.
Come on now, Bob.
Let's drink a loving cup. You sweeten it.
- Another merry Christmas, Mr. Fred.
- Yes.
A merry Christmas to you, Uncle.
God save you.
Humbug!
Christmas, humbug?
Uncle, I'm sure you don't mean that.
Humbug I said, and humbug I mean.
Merry Christmas.
What right have you to be merry?
- You're poor enough.
- What right have you to be dismal?
- You're rich enough.
- Humbug.
Now, Uncle, don't be cross.
What else can I be when I live in such a world of fools?
Merry Christmas.
What's Christmastime, but a time for paying bills without money?
A time for finding yourself a year older and not an hour richer.
If I could work my will, every idiot that goes about with "merry Christmas"... on his lips should be boiled with his own pudding... and buried with a stake of holly through his heart.
- Uncle!
- Nephew!
Keep Christmas in your own way, and let me keep it in mine.
- But you don't keep it.
- Let me leave it alone then.
Much good it has ever done you.
Uncle, there are many things which have made me happy.
Things which have never fattened my purse by even that much.
Christmas is one of these.
I've always looked on Christmas as a good time... a kind, charitable, forgiving, pleasant time.
It's the only time when people open their hearts freely.
The only time when men and women seem to realize... that all human beings are really members of the same family.
And that being members of the same family... they owe each other some measure of warmth and solace.
And therefore, Uncle, though it's never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pockets...
I believe that it has done me good, and will do me good.
And I say, God bless it!
Let me hear another sound from you... and you'll keep Christmas by losing your situation.
You're quite a powerful speaker, sir.
- I wonder you don't go into Parliament.
- Uncle, don't be angry.
Come now. Come and dine with Bess and me tomorrow.
- Bess?
- Yes. Elizabeth, my fiancee.
I'm dining with her people,
I'm sure they'd welcome a visit from you.
- So you're engaged?
- Yes.
May I ask why?
- Because I fell in love.
- Because you fell in love.
You intend to marry?
As soon as I'm earning enough money.
Has she tried her relatives?
- That wasn't the reason for my visit.
- Good afternoon.
Uncle, I ask nothing from you.
I want nothing from you.
There's no reason why we should be enemies.
Good afternoon.
Uncle, I made this visit in homage to Christmas, and I'll keep... my Christmas spirit to the last.
And so, Uncle, a merry Christmas.
- Good afternoon.
- And a happy new year.
Good afternoon!
A merry Christmas to you, Bob.
Thank you, sir. A merry Christmas to you and to your wife-to-be.
Thank you.
- A merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.
- And the same to you, sirs.
- Thank you.
- Scrooge and Marley's, I believe.
- Yes, sir.
I have the pleasure of addressing Mr. Marley?
- No, sir.
- Then you're Mr. Scrooge.
- No.
- My name is Scrooge.
- And my name is Twill.
- And mine is Rummidge.
And Mr. Marley?
Mr. Marley's been dead these seven years.
- He died seven years ago this very night.
- On Christmas Eve?
As good a time as any.
We have no doubt that Mr. Marley's liberality is well represented... by his surviving partner.
At this festive season of the year,
Mr. Scrooge... it is more than usually desirable that some slight provision be made... for the poor and destitute.
Many thousands are in want, sir, in need of common necessaries.
Hundreds of thousands are in want of common comforts, sir.
- Are there no prisons?
- Plenty of prisons.
And the workhouses, are they still in operation?
They are. Though I wish with all my heart they were not.
I was afraid from what you said at first that something had occurred... to stop them in their useful course.
Under the impression these places can scarcely furnish Christmas cheer... for the mind and body of the multitude... a few of us have endeavored to form a fund for the poor, to buy them food... and drink, and means of warmth.
What can I put you down for, sir?
Nothing.
You wish to be anonymous?
I wish to be left alone.
Since you asked me what I wish, gentlemen, that is my answer.
I help to support the institutions
I mentioned. They cost enough... and those who are badly off must go there.
Many can't go there, and many would rather die.
If they'd rather die, they'd better do it and decrease the surplus population.
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
In that case, we must apologize for interrupting you, sir.
Humbug!
You keep close watch on the closing hour.
- It's half an hour past, sir.
- Then close up.
Thank you, sir.
Don't work overtime.
You might make something of yourself.
- You'll want all day tomorrow, I suppose?
- Lf it's quite convenient, sir.
It's not convenient, and it's not fair.
If I was to stop half a crown for it, you'd consider yourself ill-used...
I'll be bound.
It's only once a year, sir.
A poor excuse for picking a man's pocket every 25th of December.
However, I suppose you'll have to have the whole day.
Be here all the earlier next morning.
- Yes, sir.
- Then be off.
Well?
My wages, sir. They fall due today.
Can't wait to spend them?
Thank you, sir.
You rascal! You want more?
Now look here, boys, just because a fellow wears a hat, you know... it doesn't mean he can't throw a snowball.
I used to do a lot of snowballing... and I found the best way to make a snowball was to take the snow into... your bare hands, like this, and then... crunch it together until the warmth from your hands...
Here!
Look who's coming down the street.
A blooming topper.
- Come on, governor. Show us.
- Right you are. Here, give me room.
Half a more.
Let her go!
A bull's-eye!
I had no idea it was you, master.
No idea at all. Truly, master.
No doubt this is your idea of a Christmas joke.
I'll get your hat, sir.
I didn't know, sir. The coach, it...
Cratchit, I told you before that I could find a man more capable than yourself.
- I need say no more.
- You mean, I'm sacked, sir?
Exactly.
But in my papers, sir, it says I must have a week's notice.
Your week's salary will recompense me for the price of a new hat. No.
As this hat cost 16 and 6, and your salary is 15 and 6... you owe me a shilling.
I say, governor, we are sorry.
The old stinker.
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!
I'd like to buy a goose.
About 5 and 8 pence.
Certainly, sir.
- That's the one.
- A very good choice, sir.
Here, let me help you.
4 penneth of potatoes,
6 penneth of mixed nuts...
6 penneth of apples.
The special pippins, sir, or the medium cookers?
- The special pippins.
- Yes, sir.
And 6... No, 8 penneth of oranges.
Thank you, sir.
Chestnuts.
Chestnuts, sir? All hot, sir.
They warm the innards and cheer the heart.
- What's Christmas without chestnuts, sir?
- What indeed.
2 penneth... No, 3 penneth.
- Yes, sir.
- Put them in my back pocket.
- Yes. I will, sir.
- That's it.
- There you are, sir.
- Now the other one.
- Here we are.
- And here's your 3 pence.
- And a merry Christmas.
- Thank you, sir.
- Bob, you have got a load.
- Haven't I, though?
And all for tomorrow.
Let me help you.
- Did you get the oranges?
- Yes.
- And the lemons?
- Yes.
- And the potatoes?
- Yes.
Oh, bless me.
- How did you carry it all?
- I really don't know.
- What's this?
- Guess.
- Roast of beef.
- No. Try again.
- Veal.
- No.
- Tripe.
- No.
- Ribs.
- No.
- I know. Sausages.
- No. Goose.
Look!
Now take it all into the kitchen.
Save Mother a step.
Let me carry something.
- Here, Tim, you may carry the neck.
- Thank you.
Go over to the fire and have a warm, Bob.
Yes, dear.
- Did you get the day off tomorrow?
- Without hardly any trouble at all.
- Wasn't Mr. Scrooge angry?
- Well, you might say he was...
- and you might say he wasn't.
- Meaning what, Bob?
Meaning I got the day off and we don't want to talk about Mr. Scrooge tonight.
Come here, you monkeys, and see what I've got.
Chestnuts!
Marley!
Humbug.
- Who are you?
- Ask me who I was.
Who were you then?
In life, I was your partner, Jacob Marley.
Well...
- what do you want?
- Much.
- You don't believe in me?
- I don't.
What proof would you have of my reality beyond that of your own senses?
- I don't know.
- Why do you doubt your senses?
Because a little thing affects them.
A slight disorder of the stomach makes them liars.
You may be an undigested bit of beef, a blot of mustard, or a crumb of cheese.
Humbug, I tell you. Humbug!
Silence!
Watch! There's an intruder in my room.
- Right up, sir. Law and order.
- Here's my key. Make haste.
Good.
We'll soon see how real you are.
I made this visit for your welfare,
Ebenezer Scrooge.
- In here.
- Right-o.
There he is. Out with him!
Your intruder seems to have extruded, if I may say so, governor.
He was here when I opened the door.
He was a spirit. Someone I know.
Of course, a spirit.
A great night for spirits, sir, of one sort or another.
Meaning, governor, we wouldn't mind a bit of spirit ourselves.
You may leave!
Indigestion, that's what it was.
Out with you!
Sorry we couldn't be of any assistance, governor.
Perhaps the next spirits you have, we can.
Man of the worldly mind.
- Now do you believe in me?
- I do. I must.
But why? Why do you trouble me?
It is required of every man that the spirit within him should walk abroad... among his fellow men.
If that spirit goes not forth in life, it must do so after death.
- You are bound in heavy chains.
- I wear the chain I forged in life.
Is its pattern strange to you?
The chain you will bear was full as heavy and as long as this... seven Christmas Eves ago.
It must be a ponderous chain by now.
Jacob. Old Jacob Marley...
- have you no comfort for me?
- None.
And none for myself.
In life, my spirit never walked beyond... the narrow limits of our money-changing hole... and weary journeys lie before me.
- You travel fast?
- On the wings of the wind.
You must have covered a great quantity of ground in seven years.
Captive, bound, and double-ironed.
No space of regret can make amends for the wasted opportunities of one life.
Poor and ignorant Scrooge.
Yet, such was I.
But you were always a good man of business, Jacob.
Business. Mankind was my business.
The common welfare was my business.
Charity, mercy, forbearance, and benevolence... all these were my business.
It is at this time of the year that I suffer most.
To see the want I could have stopped, the suffering I could have solaced.
The hunger I could have satisfied.
Hear me.
My time is nearly gone.
If you must go, Jacob, don't let me keep you.
I have sat invisible beside you many and many a day.
I am here to warn you that you have one chance of escaping my fate.
- One chance, Ebenezer Scrooge.
- What is it?
You will be haunted by three spirits.
Is that the chance you mentioned, Jacob?
It is.
I think I'd rather not.
Unless you suffer these three visitations, your fate will be the same as mine.
Jacob. Don't leave me yet. Jacob!
Expect the first when the bell tolls 1:00... the second on the stroke of 2:00... the third on the last vibration of 3:00.
Couldn't I take all three at once and have it over?
Remember, the first at 1:00... the second at 2:00, the third at 3:00.
Humbug.
- Are you the spirit I was told to expect?
- I am.
- Who are you?
- I am the Ghost of Christmas Past.
The light. It hurts my eyes.
- It blinds me.
- I'm not surprised.
It's the warming light of thankfulness... the light of gratitude to others.
- I've never seen it before.
- Of course not.
It's men of greed like you who have long forgotten gratitude.
What's your business with me?
Your welfare. Your reclamation.
Rise and walk with me.
- We spirits have no fear.
- But I'm not a spirit.
Bear but the touch of my hand on your heart, and you shall be safe.
Good heaven! This is my old school!
I was a boy here.
Merry Christmas!
Harry, Joe, Tommy, Percy and Dick!
Dick Wilkins!
These are but shadows of things that have been.
They have no consciousness of us.
You knew them?
I went to school with them, all of them.
- Your lip is trembling.
- The cold.
- Let's continue. You remember this way?
- Remember it?
I could walk it blindfold.
Strange to have forgotten it for so many years.
- That is myself.
- Was yourself.
Was.
What is that upon your cheek?
Nothing. The cold.
Listen.
Goodbye, young Scrooge.
Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas, Jack.
- Your parents coming for you?
- No. I'm staying at school for the holidays.
- You are?
Always do, you know?
Father and I talked it over.
We decided that some extra swatting at my studies would do me more good than...
Christmas at home.
Christmas, plum pudding and turkeys... that's just for children.
I say, your governor must be a crusty old bird.
- He knows what's best.
- Jack, hurry!
Right-o. I didn't mean anything against your father, Eb. Good luck.
Merry Christmas!
- Master Scrooge.
- Yes, sir?
Your sister's come to see you.
Ebbie, dear Ebbie.
I've come to bring you home.
Home, Fran? Home?
Father is so much kinder than he used to be... that home is like heaven.
That's why I asked him if you could come home, and he said, "Yes."
And he sent me to fetch you with a coach.
And, Ebbie, Father says that you're going to go to work... and never come back here.
And we're going to have a turkey and chestnuts and everything.
God bless you, Fran.
Ebbie, it's going to be so glorious.
God bless you.
- She loved you.
- She did.
I believe she had children before she died.
- One child.
- Your nephew, Fred.
Come.
You remember this place?
Fezziwig's warehouse.
I was apprenticed here.
It's old Fezziwig.
It's old Fezziwig alive again.
Ebenezer, Dick!
Yes, sir?
Ebenezer Scrooge, Dick Wilkins.
Yes, sir?
Do you observe the time, sir?
7:05, sir.
Do you know you've let me work you five minutes overtime?
No more work tonight.
Christmas Eve, Dick. Christmas, Ebenezer.
Up with the shutters. Close up shop.
In the eye, Dick. Cheer up, Ebenezer.
What a lark.
He always comes through, doesn't he?
- Always comes through does old Fezziwig.
- And royally, too.
And royally, too.
Nothing's too good for Fezziwig.
Closed up tight, sirs?
- Tight as a barrel, sir.
- Good.
Now, about tomorrow.
It's a holiday, of course.
But I shall expect you to spend part of it, at least, with me... eating Christmas dinner.
Thank you, sir.
And as probably you'll eat too much to be any good next day... we'll make that a holiday, too.
Good night, Ebenezer. Good night, Dick.
Good night, sir. And thank you, sir.
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
- A sovereign.
- A whole sovereign.
- Solid gold is old Fezziwig.
- Solid gold, through and through.
What is the matter?
Nothing particular.
Something, I think.
Yes, there is.
Old Fezziwig was very kind to me.
Yes, he was. But he's dead now.
Perhaps you feel you'd like to repay his kindness to you.
Well?
You have a clerk, Bob Cratchit.
Old Fezziwig would have been very happy... if you had shown your gratitude to him by showing kindness to others.
Your clerk, for instance.
Business is business.
I'm a good businessman!
My time grows short.
I have yet to show you the black years of your life.
Your gradual enslavement to greed.
- Your ruthlessness.
- No!
Your ingratitude.
Your wretched thirst for gold.
No, leave me. I can't stand more.
I can't stand more!
Come here.
Come here and know me better, Scrooge.
I am the Ghost of Christmas Present.
Have you never seen the like of me before?
Never.
And have you never known my elder brothers, born these years before me?
I'm afraid I haven't.
Have you had many brothers, Spirit?
A huge number. Some...
A tremendous family to provide for.
What are we going to do?
Walk into the world this Christmas night, so that you can... hear and see and feel Christmas in the world this night.
Did you say "walk" or "fly"?
Touch my robe.
Good morning, and a merry, merry Christmas to you.
Merry Christmas to you.
These people, what are they doing?
The poor find it cheaper to bring their dinners to the baker to be cooked.
Now then, watch who you're stepping on.
Watch who I'm stepping on? I like that.
- Go on, off it.
- I will not!
Why you little...
- Here, let's make it up.
- Frightened?
I wouldn't touch your old hand.
I wouldn't...
Well, you're not such a bad sort after all.
Thank you, and a merry Christmas to you.
And the same to you.
What do you sprinkle from that horn that made them stop quarreling?
It's a spirit... five times distilled, the spirit of Christmas cheer... of love, of all that's good... of all that makes this time of year different from any other time.
Is there a peculiar flavor in what you sprinkle?
An excellent flavor.
Would it apply to any kind of dinner?
To a poor one most.
Why to a poor one most?
Because it needs it most.
Look where you're going, you big, clumsy ox, you. I'll...
I'll shove those words down your nasty little throat.
Stop shoving, will you?
Stop it, I say, or I'll...
Here we are being silly, aren't we now?
Like a couple of infants.
I say, I know a nice little pub where they sell hot rum and gin.
- We stopped that.
- Yes, we did, didn't we?
That church.
We have business there. Come.
O come, all ye faithful
Joyful and triumphant
O come ye,
O come ye to Bethlehem
Come and behold Him
Born the King of Angels!
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
Christ the Lord
Oh, sing, choirs of angels
I don't believe for a minute that they love one another.
What makes you say that, Spirit?
It is obvious that they love each other dearly.
Nevertheless, don't you think that... it's lucky that they haven't the wherewithal to get married?
Their love will soon fade.
I take exception to that!
On the contrary,
I think their love would grow.
I... They...
They should be married.
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
Christ the Lord
Yea, Lord we greet thee
Born this happy morning
Jesus to Thee be all glory given
Word of the Father
Now in flesh appearing
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
Christ the Lord
Amen
- Good morning and merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas to you.
Bob, a merry Christmas to you.
This is my fiancee, Bess.
This is Mr. Cratchit, and his son Tim.
How do you do?
Now, Tim, no secrets.
What were you saying?
I said, sir...
- I said she's very pretty.
- Tim!
- Thank you kindly, Tim.
- Don't you agree with him, Bob?
- Yes, sir. She is very pretty.
- Father!
Thank you kindly, Mr. Cratchit.
- Good morning.
- Goodbye.
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.
Come on, darling. Let's have a slide.
But, Fred, you can't.
Can't I?
You should have seen me yesterday.
But in front of the church? It isn't right.
But, darling, it looks perfect.
It is perfect.
- It's as slippery as a codfish's tummy.
- No, Fred, no!
But, darling, just one slide. Only one.
- Yeah.
- Well, all right.
Boys! Sliding in front of the church?
Now run away home.
And a merry Christmas to you all.
- Run home.
- See?
But, darling, he has no soul.
He's simply acting like a grownup.
I still say he has no soul.
He just doesn't appreciate the qualities of a good slide.
Come on.
One, two, three.
- Giddyap.
- Merry Christmas, Tom.
And a merry Christmas to you, Bob.
- And to you, too, Tiny Tim.
- Thank you. Merry Christmas, sir.
Spirit, tell me if Tiny Tim will live.
If the shadows remain unaltered by the future, the child will die.
No!
Surely he'll be spared.
With the kind of care that money can buy, who could tell?
But Bob Cratchit has no money.
Not even a position, I've heard.
If all this remains unaltered by the future... the next Christmas will not find Tiny Tim here.
But what of it?
If he be like to die, he'd better do it and decrease the population.
Come.
Mother! The goose, we smelled it.
Outside the baker's.
- We did, didn't we?
- It was ours. We knew.
Because of the smell.
Young, sharp noses. Out you go.
What's got into your father and Tim?
And Martha wasn't this late last Christmas by half an hour.
Here's Martha, Mother.
Here she is, Mother. Here's Martha.
There's a goose for Christmas, Martha.
Bless your heart.
I was afraid you weren't coming.
We'd a deal of sewing to finish up last night, and this morning... we had to clear up the shop.
Just so long as you've come.
- You're cold, child.
- Not very.
Sit down by the fire and have a warm.
Father's here, Mama.
- Hide.
- Hide in here.
Here we come.
Whoa it is. Hello.
There we are.
Belinda.
- Where's our Martha?
- Not coming.
Not coming?
Not coming on Christmas day?
Martha girl.
Come, Tim, into the back.
Smell the pudding.
- Was it a good service, Bob?
- Beautiful. That's what it was.
I wish you'd been there.
So long as you and Tim were there,
I feel it did us all good.
- Here, I'll give that gravy what for.
- Thank you, dear.
Belinda, you sweeten up the applesauce.
- I have, Mommy. It's on the table.
- Good girl.
- Peter, take this chair inside.
- Yes, Mother.
Now, I'm going to take one last look at the table.
What a Christmas!
There never was such a Christmas.
Here, Martha, taste this.
Sweet enough?
- Well, it's still a wee bit sour.
- So.
- Been working hard, Father?
- Yes.
How's old Scrooge?
- Same as ever.
- What's the matter?
Not a thing. Not a single blessed thing.
Something at the office?
No. Why, it was only yesterday
Mr. Scrooge came to me... shook my hand and, "Cratchit," he says, "Cratchit, my lad"... he calls me "my lad"...
"You're one in 1,000. You're..."
Something is wrong. What is it?
- I've been sacked, Martha.
- Father!
- When was it?
- Last night.
You haven't told Mother?
Bad luck.
Sorry I told you. I really shouldn't have.
I thought it might make me feel better.
Bob!
There's Mother. Come along. Cheer up.
Here we go.
Here we are!
How's that?
You know, I don't think there is anyone, not anyone, who can touch my punch.
Nor do I, Bob.
- Do you like our table?
- It's beautiful, my dear.
- Peter.
- Yes, Mother?
You can go to the baker's now.
- And get the goose?
- Yes.
The goose!
There never was such a goose.
- It's a good bird, Bob.
- And reasonable, too.
- I'd like to stroke it.
- Tim.
- We haven't eaten it all at last.
- That we haven't.
And now the pudding.
Belinda and me'll clear, Mother.
- I'll help with the pudding, Mother.
- No, I'd rather do it alone.
- It might not turn out.
- Of course it will. It always has.
Unless someone's climbed into the back and stolen it.
Stolen it?
Hurry, Mother, hurry!
Pass them over to this side.
It's there. The pudding's there.
- Hooray!
- Come along.
I smell it. Do you smell it, Peter?
That's the cloth coming off.
- The holly's in.
- It is?
It's blazing.
Here it comes! Here comes the pudding.
- Off with the lights.
- Off with the lights. Hurry.
Hurry up.
It did turn out, and it's not stolen.
- It looks so good.
- Tim.
It looks like the best you've ever made, my dear.
Bob, you say that every year.
Every year they get better.
How that's possible, don't ask me.
But it's true.
So eat.
Mother, you haven't got any.
I don't want any, dear.
- You must. Here, have some of mine.
- Just a little spoonful.
I'm sure I'm going to burst.
Not in here, my lad.
If you want to burst, you go outside.
You've hardly any tummy at all.
Look at mine.
Now then, enough of that, or there will be a calamity.
- Peter, put some chestnuts on the fire.
- Yes, sir.
Let's tidy the table, girls.
Such a smell.
Sweet enough?
Sweet as honey.
Obviously made by an expert.
And are only experts allowed to taste it?
My dear. Glasses all. Glasses.
Fill mine, Father. Thank you.
- Three, four.
- Thank you.
- Five.
- Thank you.
- Six.
- Thank you.
- Seven.
- Thank you.
Well, this is the largest, but a merry Christmas to us, my dears.
And God bless us all.
And here's to next Christmas, may it bring us luck.
And may Mr. Scrooge give your father a raise.
And a merry Christmas to Mr. Scrooge.
I'll drink to that.
- Delicious.
- How lovely.
And now, Father, a story please.
Yes. Please, a story, Father.
Right you are. A story it is.
Come along, kids. Sit here.
Now let me see.
It seems that once upon a time, there was a little boy...
about your size, Timmy...
- Come, Scrooge, we must go.
- Must we?
Just let me hear Bob's story.
It's about Aladdin and the magic lamp.
Please let me stay.
No, Scrooge.
And he said that Christmas was humbug.
As I live, he did.
As if anything that gave excuse for this could be humbug.
- Your uncle should be ashamed.
- I'm sorry for him.
I couldn't be angry with him if I tried.
After all, he punishes himself.
And how does he do that, pray?
- Well, he has money, hasn't he?
- Yes.
And he makes no use of it, mark you, no use of it whatsoever.
Therefore, he's a far more pathetic and unhappy case... than a man who has no money at all.
QED, he punishes himself.
Now, that's a wonderful idea.
Tom here suggests that we play a game.
Now what shall it be?
- Blindman's buff.
- Blindman's buff? Right.
But first, I want you to drink a toast.
To my uncle Scrooge.
It seems a shame to waste a toast on a man like that.
But, darling, think how happy he makes everyone feel, by contrast.
- To my uncle, Scrooge.
- To Uncle Scrooge.
- Come along now, Tom. You're it.
- Come on, Tom.
You'd best catch us.
Tie it tight.
- Are you sure you can see?
- Perfectly.
That's good.
One, two, three.
Come on, quick.
Quick, he might catch you.
Please, let me stay, just until they finish.
But you don't like Christmas.
It's a time for fools.
I won't go with you. I'm going to stay.
I'm going to stay, I tell you.
Don't be a fool, man.
You don't like Christmas.
But I do. I do like Christmas!
I love Christmas!
You are the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come?
You are about to show me things that have not happened... but will happen in the future.
Is that so, Spirit?
Ghost of the Future,
I know you are here to do me good... and as I hope to be another man from what I was...
I'm ready to accompany you.
Won't you speak?
Lead on.
I shall follow gladly.
No, I don't know much about it either way.
I only know he's dead.
- When did he die?
- Last night, I believe.
- What was the matter with him?
- Who knows? Who cares?
- What has he done with his money?
- I haven't heard.
He hasn't left it to me. That's all I know.
It's likely to be a very cheap funeral.
Upon my life,
I can't think of anybody to go to it.
Suppose we form a party and volunteer.
I don't mind going, if a lunch is provided.
I'll offer to go if anybody else will.
Now I come to think of it,
I'm not sure I wasn't his best friend.
We used to stop and speak whenever we met.
Goodbye.
- How are you?
- How are you?
I know them. I know them both.
Business associates.
So Old Scratch got his own at last?
Yeah, so I've been told. It's cold, isn't it?
Seasonable for Christmas.
- You're not a skater, I suppose.
- No time for it. Business on my mind.
- Well, good morning.
- Good morning.
Is death always like this?
Is it never followed by sorrow and weeping?
It must be getting near your father's time.
Past it, Mommy.
Though he has walked home slower these last few evenings.
I've known him walk with Tiny Tim upon his shoulder very fast indeed.
And so have I, often.
But he was very light to carry, and his father loved him so.
It was no trouble. No trouble.
There's your father at the door.
There you are, my nippers.
Dear.
Here, Father, sit here.
I saw Mr. Scrooge's nephew today.
You did?
Yes, he is a nice fellow.
He saw I looked a trifle down.
Just a trifle, you know.
He asked me what was wrong.
Thank you, dear.
I told him about Tim.
He's such a sweet fellow, somehow I didn't mind telling him.
"I'm heartily sorry for it, Bob," he said.
"And heartily sorry for your good wife."
By the by, how he ever knew that,
I don't know.
Knew what, my dear?
- That you were a good wife.
- Bob.
It really seemed that he knew our Tim and felt with us.
- I'm sure he's a good soul, Bob.
- He is.
And I'm sure that... when we remember how gentle and patient Tim was... we shan't quarrel among ourselves... and in doing it, forget our Tim.
No, Father.
I'm very happy.
I am.
Poor Tim. Poor Tiny Tim.
Everyone who knew him must feel sorrow.
Sorrow they'd never feel for me.
Spirit... tell me the name of the man we saw lying dead.
Tell me!
Answer me this, Spirit.
Are these things you've shown me... are they the shadows of the things that will be, or of the things that may be?
Men's lives lead to certain ends... but if those lives be changed, will not the ends be changed?
Tell me that is true! Tell me!
Then I was the man who lay upon the bed.
No!
Why show me this if I am past all hope?
I shall change my way of living.
I will try to keep Christmas all the year.
I will live in the past, the present, and the future.
The spirit of all three shall be in my heart.
I shall never forget the lessons that they teach.
Tell me that this will change my future.
Tell me that this is not my end.
Please!
Hello!
Hello, there. What's today?
- What's today, my fine fellow?
- Today?
Why, Christmas day.
Do you know the poulterer's at the next street but one, at the corner?
- I should hope I do.
- An intelligent boy.
A remarkable boy.
Do you know whether they've sold the prize turkey that was hanging there?
Not the little prize turkey, the big one.
- It's hanging there now.
- Is it?
- Well, go and buy it.
- What, sir?
I'm in earnest. Yes, I am. Go and buy it.
Come back in less than five minutes, and I'll give you half a crown.
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.
My dear sirs, how do you do?
How do you do?
A merry Christmas to you.
Mr. Scrooge?
Yes, that is my name.
It may not be pleasant to you.
Let me ask your pardon.
And will you have the goodness to take...
Why, bless me, Mr. Scrooge.
Are you in earnest?
If you please. Not a farthing less.
There are a great many back payments... in that amount. Will you do me that favor?
My dear Mr. Scrooge,
I don't know what to say. Such...
Such generosity.
Don't say anything, please, but come and see me. Will you come and see me?
We will, Mr. Scrooge.
Thank you. Bless you.
Hello, my love.
- Would you tell Mr. Fred I wish to see him?
- Yes, sir.
Fred!
- Who is this?
- Your uncle.
Your uncle Scrooge.
Uncle, I didn't know you.
The smile changes me, doesn't it?
But, what are we doing out here?
Come in, Uncle, come in.
This is my uncle. My uncle Scrooge.
How do you do?
Fred, you dog. Who is this fellow?
Not your uncle, I'll be bound.
He'd never have a smile like that.
- He said that...
- That Christmas was a humbug.
- That people who celebrated it were fools.
- Yes, that's what he said.
It was stupid of him.
He won't say it again, mark you.
He won't say it again, ever.
And this is Bess.
May I tell you a secret?
Here, I say. Now what is this?
- No.
- You tell him.
Fred!
Darling!
That's wonderful.
Uncle, thank you so much.
- Merry Christmas, Bob.
- What?
Merry Christmas, Bob!
Here, give this to your wife.
Your good wife.
- Where's Tiny Tim?
- He's out in the back with the others.
Well, get him. Bring him here.
- Bring them all here.
- Yes, sir, I shall.
It's Scrooge. It's Mr. Scrooge.
He's crazy. Quite mad.
Off his top. Lost his buttons.
- Don't be stupid, Bob.
- Look, he gave us this, and more besides.
- Gave it to us?
- Yes.
Then he has gone mad.
Bob, what shall we do?
Our children, Bob. Save them!
Thank heaven, Mr. Fred. You've come for him, of course. Poor fellow.
Did you think he'd gone barmy, too?
No, we haven't come for him.
He told us to wait outside. He said he had some presents he wanted to give you.
- Then he's all right?
- I hope so.
He made me his partner.
We're to be married, Bob.
Isn't that wonderful?
- It is wonderful.
- Yes.
My wife.
My dear.
- Has he gone?
- He's all right.
- Come along, you must meet him.
- No.
- Bob Cratchit.
- Yes, sir?
- Pass out the punch.
- Yes, sir.
I'm going to raise your salary, Bob.
Thank you, sir.
Are you sure?
And when Peter, the scoundrel, when Peter gets a little older... we'll have a job for him, too.
- Won't we, Fred?
- Yes, sir.
- Everything for everybody, Fred?
- Yes.
Here it is, sir.
I'm a little rusty at this.
- I've never done it before, but may I?
- Yes.
Please do.
To all of us, everywhere.
A merry Christmas to us all, my dears.
God bless us, every one.
May I go out now,
Miss Simpson?
Has it stopped snowing?
Not quite.
If it has stopped when your sister returns, perhaps she will take you out.
Oh, dear.
Here, kitty.
Suppose it never stops.
Suppose the man in charge of the snow has forgotten how to stop it.
Don't you think you had better work a while at your sampler?
No, thank you.
Oh, dear.
Hello, Sir Turtle.
You really must stop that,
Your Majesty. Stop it, I say!
Stop what?
The White Queen just knocked over the White King.
She never does look where she's going.
Alice, you know you are not supposed to play with your father's chessmen.
But I wasn't playing.
She deliberately bumped into His
Majesty and knocked him off his feet.
Alice, are you sure that that is true?
Well, I saw it.
Alice.
Yes, Miss Simpson.
At any rate, Your Majesty, stop bumping into your husband.
And you might tidy up a bit.
A white rabbit!
All dressed up in a muffler and overcoat and big woolly shoes.
There. It's gone into its nice warm rabbit hole.
It looked so funny all dressed up.
Alice, I am sure you know that there is no such thing as a rabbit dressed up in a muffler and an overcoat.
You must not say what is not true.
Well, it...
It wasn't untrue exactly.
I think you had better finish your tea.
There is another egg for you to eat.
I did eat both eggs, but I put one of them all back together again.
Alice!
Yes, Miss Simpson.
The looking-glass room.
You see, Dinah, as soon as I hold you up, the little girl in the looking-glass room holds up another cat just like you.
Oh, Dinah, wouldn't you like to see what the looking-glass house is like?
You know, Dinah, there is a looking-glass house.
First, there's the room you can see through the glass.
That's just the same as our sitting room, only the things go the other way.
You'd love living there.
But, of course, I don't know whether looking-glass milk is good to drink.
Well, anyway, then we would come to the hallway.
It is very like our own hallway as far as you can see, only it may be quite different beyond that.
Oh, Dinah,
wouldn't it be nice if we could get through to...
I can see all of the looking-glass room from here, all but a bit.
I would so like to see that little bit just behind the fireplace.
Do you think, Dinah, that if I pressed very, very hard and tried to look straight down, that I might...
Why, why...
Well, I knew this part of the room would be different.
But I do wish the looking-glass chair had moved when I moved ours.
There seems no other way.
If I could only fall like that all the time!
Can't be English.
Of course.
It's the looking-glass room.
Why, it's Uncle and Aunt!
I knew that if you could really get behind a picture,
you'd see the backs of people.
Poor Uncle Gilbert.
His trousers are all patched.
My dear niece, how would you like being framed in one pair of trousers for
20 years without being patched?
It must be very difficult.
It is.
But after all, it's only the front of a picture that counts, really.
Of course.
That is all.
What did you say?
But your hands say
20 minutes to 4:00.
I never let my left hand know what my right hand is doing.
This side of the looking glass has me all confused.
That's because everything is backward on your side.
Why, I...
I never...
Mama! Mama! Mama!
Mama! Mama!
What's that?
It's the voice of my child!
Your child!
Oh, my precious lily!
My imperial kitten!
I must be with my child.
Let me help you.
Mama! Mama!
Dear me.
There, there, my royal pawn.
Poor thing.
Watch out for the volcano.
It blew me up! Be sure you come up the regular way.
Don't get blown up.
You'll be hours and hours getting to the table at that rate.
I'd far better help you.
No, no!
The King's men! Somebody call out the King's men!
I assure you, my dear, I shall never, never forget the horror of this moment.
Well, you will forget, unless you make a memorandum of it.
I shall be very happy to remind you.
We will not be reminded by a volcano.
I'm not a volcano, and
I'm not a cyclone, either.
Then you're either a cyclano or a volcone.
And...
Well, what time was that?
I really haven't any idea, but it's very late.
I must hurry or I shall have to go back through the looking glass
before I've seen what the rest of the house is like.
My, what a strange way to walk about the garden.
The Duchess! The Duchess! Won't she be savage if I've kept her waiting!
Oh, dear! Oh, dear!
I shall be too late!
My ears and whiskers, how late it is getting!
Well, after such a fall as this,
I shall think nothing of tumbling downstairs.
I wish Dinah were here.
That's such pretty music.
Oh, dear.
Ouch.
Goodbye, dear feet.
Oh, will I ever get to the beautiful garden?
Oh!
Oh, Mouse!
Do you know the way out of this pool, oh, Mouse?
I'm very tired of swimming about here.
Perhaps you don't understand English.
I daresay you're a French mouse.
That's French for,
"Where is my cat?"
I beg your pardon. I quite forgot you didn't like cats.
Wait, oh, Mouse!
Oh, Mouse!
Not like cats?
Would you like cats if you were me?
Don't be angry. I wish I could show you our cat Dinah.
You'd take quite a fancy to her.
She's such a dear, quiet thing, and so good at catching mice.
Oh, I beg your pardon.
I hate you!
I hate cats!
My whole family hates cats.
Nasty, low, vulgar things!
Oh, dear!
Wait, oh, Mouse!
Cats! Cats!
Cats!
William the Conqueror, whose cause was favored by the pope, was soon submitted to by the
English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest.
Who are you, please?
I am a dodo.
How do you do?
My name is Alice.
And you are very wet.
I'm afraid I am, but there isn't much I can do about getting dry.
History is the driest thing I know.
Shall we dry you with history?
I'd be much obliged if you could.
Listen well.
Edwin and Morcar, the earls of
Mercia and Northumbria, found it advisable to go with Edgar Aetheling to meet William and offer him the crown.
William's conduct at first was moderate, but the insolence of his Normans...
How are you getting on, my dear?
Beautifully, thank you.
Shall I put you to sleep now?
No, thank you!
Then you'd best run along.
I'm about to recite some dates.
Yes, sir.
Thank you. Goodbye.
1585, Shakespeare was born,
1616, Shakespeare died...
Who are you?
I hardly know, sir, just at present.
At least, I know who I was when I got up this morning, but I must have changed several times since then.
What do you mean by that?
Explain yourself.
I can't explain myself, because I'm not myself, you see.
I don't see!
I can't put it more clearly,
for I can't understand it myself to begin with.
And being so many different sizes in one day is confusing.
It isn't.
Well, when some day you turn into a chrysalis, and after that into a butterfly,
you'll find it a bit queer, won't you?
Not a bit!
Well, maybe you wouldn't, but it would certainly feel very queer to me.
You? Who are you?
I think you ought to tell me who you are first.
Why?
Good day, sir.
Come back. I have something important to say.
Yes?
Keep your temper.
Is that all?
No.
So you think you've changed, do you?
I'm afraid I have, sir.
What size do you want to be?
I should like to be a little larger, sir, if you wouldn't mind.
Three inches is such a horrid height to be.
I am three inches high! It's a very good height to be!
I'm sure it must be, sir, but you see, I'm not used to it.
You'll get used to it in time.
One side will make you grow taller.
The other side will make you grow shorter.
One side of...
Of what?
The mushroom.
Which side will make me grow larger?
The large-making side, of course.
I'll take a little of both to make sure.
Oh, dear, now I'm too big again, oh, Caterpillar.
Mr. Caterpillar, sir, where are you?
Whoever lives here, it would never do to come upon them this size.
Why, I should frighten them out of their wits.
For the Duchess.
An invitation from the Queen to play croquet.
My compliments to the Queen.
My compliments to the Duchess.
There's no sort of use in your knocking.
Please, sir, how am I to get in?
I shall sit here till tomorrow.
I'm sorry you were hit, but how am I to get in?
I shall sit here for days and days.
But what am I to do?
Anything you like.
Please watch out for the baby!
She nearly killed the poor little thing.
If everybody minded their own business, the world would go round much faster than it does.
Speak roughly to your little boy And beat him when he sneezes
He only does it to annoy
Because he knows it teases
Wow! Wow! Wow!
Wow!
Wow!
Wow!
He only does it to annoy
Because he knows it teases
Here, you can nurse it a bit if you like.
Now, I must go and get ready to play croquet with the Queen.
Don't grunt. That's not at all a proper way of expressing yourself.
What am I going to do with this creature when I get it home?
If you're going to turn into a pig, my dear,
I'll have nothing more to do with you. Mind now!
There's no mistake about you now. You're a pig!
You would have grown up to be a dreadfully ugly child, but you do make a handsome pig, I think.
Why do you grin, oh, cat?
Because I'm a Cheshire Cat, that's why.
Well, then,
Cheshire puss, would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?
That depends a good deal on where you want to get to.
I don't care much where.
Then it doesn't matter which way you go.
So long as
I get somewhere.
You're sure to do that, if you only walk long enough.
Do you play croquet with the Queen today?
I should like it very much, but I haven't been invited yet.
You'll see me there.
Must you go so soon?
By the by, what became of the baby?
I'd nearly forgotten to ask.
It turned into a pig.
I thought it would.
Did you say pig or fig?
I said pig
and I wish you wouldn't keep appearing and vanishing so suddenly.
You make one quite giddy.
All right.
Don't you wish you could do this?
Well, I've often seen a cat without a grin, but a grin without a cat?
No room! No room!
No room! No room!
There's plenty of room!
Have some wine?
I don't see any wine.
There isn't any.
It wasn't very civil of you to offer it.
Your hair needs cutting.
You should not make personal remarks. It's very rude.
Why is a raven like a writing desk?
I believe I can answer that.
Do you mean you can find the answer to it?
Exactly so.
You should say what you mean.
What day of the month is it?
Fourth.
Ah! Two days wrong.
I told you that butter wouldn't suit the works.
Oh!
Some crumbs must have got in it as well.
Hmm. I put it in with a bread knife.
It was the best butter, you know.
What a funny watch! It tells the days of the month,
but doesn't tell what "o'clock" it is.
Have you guessed the riddle yet?
Why... Why, no. I give it up.
What is the answer?
I haven't the slightest idea!
Nor I!
I think you might do something better with time than wasting it asking a lot of riddles that have no answers.
Don't you speak about Time. I daresay you've never even spoken to him.
Perhaps not.
Time and I quarreled last March, just before he went mad, you know.
It was at a great concert given by the Queen of Hearts,
and I had to sing, "Twinkle, twinkle, little bat How I wonder what you're at"
You know the song, perhaps?
I've heard something like it.
It goes on, you know, like this.
Twinkle, twinkle, little bat
How I wonder what you're at
Up above the world you fly
Like a tea tray in the sky
Up above the world you fly
Like a tea tray in the sky
Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle...
Twinkle, twinkle, little bat
How I wonder what you're at
Up above the world you fly
Like a tea tray in the sky
Up above the world you fly
Like a tea tray in the sky
Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle
Twinkle, twinkle...
Well, I'd hardly finished the first verse when the Queen bawled,
"He's murdering the Time!
Off with his head!"
And ever since that, he won't do a thing I ask.
It's always 6:00 now.
Is that why all the tea things are out here?
Yes, that's it.
It's always teatime, and we have no time to wash the tea things in between.
Take some more tea.
I haven't had any yet, so I can't take more.
You mean you can't take less. It is very easy to take more than nothing.
I want a clean cup.
It's the stupidest tea party
I ever was at in all my life!
Very curious!
Would you please tell me why are you painting those roses?
I...
Well, as a matter of fact, Miss, this tree should have been a red rose tree and we put in a white one by mistake, and if the Queen should find out,
we'll all have our heads cut off.
So, you see, Miss, we're doing our best before she comes back to paint...
The Queen!
The Queen!
The Queen!
Come, come, get up!
Her Majesty, the Queen of Hearts.
Her Majesty, the Queen!
Off with his head!
Off with his head!
What is your name, child?
My name is Alice, so please Your Majesty.
Off with her head!
Off with her head!
Nonsense!
Off with her head!
Off with her head!
Consider, my dear.
She's only a child.
Off with her head!
Off with her head!
And besides, this is the executioners' day off.
It is, is it? Well, they shall lose their heads for this!
Can you play croquet?
Yes.
Then let the game begin at once.
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!
Must I behead you all?
Here, take it. Play.
Off with some heads.
You're pointing the wrong way for a mallet!
Pardon me. My back hurts.
Well!
Don't look at me.
I'm as mixed up as you are!
This game's slowing up.
Off with some heads!
Where are my victims?
Search the hedges.
Thrash the bushes.
Shake the trees!
How glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing.
How did you like your game?
Well, it was very exciting.
Of course it is.
And the moral of that is,
"Be what you would like to be."
Or, to put it more simply, "Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise
"than what it might appear to others that what you were or might have been
"wasn't otherwise than what you had been
"would have appeared to them to be otherwise."
I should understand that better if it were written down.
I can't quite follow it as you say it.
That's nothing to what
I could say, if I chose.
And the moral of that is...
It's a fine day,
Your Majesty.
I give you fair warning. Either you or your head must be off at once!
Please, Your Majesty, could you make it go away?
Queen! Queen!
Where are you, Queen?
What fun!
What is the fun?
The Queen.
They never really execute anybody she condemns, you know.
The King...
The King pardons everybody.
I'm very happy to know that, I'm sure.
Have you seen the Mock Turtle yet?
Why... Why, no. I don't even know what a Mock Turtle is.
It's what mock turtle soup's made from.
Come here, will you,
Mock Turtle, old thing?
What is his sorrow?
It's all his fancy.
He hasn't got no sorrow.
No sorrow, indeed.
Mine are the sorrows of a sorrowful sorrow.
Mine are the woes of a woeful woe.
Mine are the...
This here young lady, she wants for to know your history, she do.
I'll tell it her.
Sit down, both of you, and don't speak a word till I've finished.
Once I was a real turtle.
Oh, dear!
Oh, dear!
When we were little, we went to school in the sea.
The master was an old turtle.
We used to call him Tortoise.
Why did you call him
Tortoise if he wasn't one?
We called him Tortoise because he taught us.
You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question.
We went to school in the sea, though you mayn't believe it.
I never said I didn't. You did.
Hold your tongue!
We had the best of educations.
In fact, we went to school every day.
I've been to a day school, too.
We learned
French and music.
I only took the regular course.
What was that?
Reeling and writhing to begin with.
And then the different branches of arithmetic, ambition, distraction, uglification and derision.
And how many hours a day did you do lessons?
Ten hours the first day and nine the next and so on.
That's why they're called lessons, because they lessen from day to day.
Then the 11th day must have been a holiday.
Of course.
And how did you manage on the 12th day?
Well, that's enough about lessons.
Shall we play games, or shall the Mock Turtle sing?
Oh, a song, please, if the
Mock Turtle would be so kind.
No accounting for tastes.
Sing her Turtle Soup, will you, old fellow?
In a moment.
Beautiful soup
Who cares for fish
Game, or any other dish?
Who would not give all else for two
Pennyworth only of beautiful soup?
Pennyworth only of beautiful soup
Beautiful soup, beautiful soup
Soup of the evening
Beautiful soup, beautiful...
Faster! Faster!
Faster! Faster!
Faster! Much faster!
Are we nearly there?
Nearly there?
Why, we passed it
10 minutes ago. Faster!
It's all marked out like a chessboard.
Of course it's a chessboard,
and life is a chessboard, and you are a Queen's pawn.
You will go immediately to the fourth square, which you should reach in exactly no time.
Did you remark something?
I didn't know I had to make one just then.
You should have told me how kind it is of me to tell you all this.
No questions? Very well, then, no answers.
Open your mouth wide when you speak, and always speak in French
if you can't think of the English for something.
Turn out your toes as you walk
and always say "Your
Majesty," and so forth.
If you think we're waxworks, you ought to pay, you know.
Waxworks weren't made to be looked at for nothing, nohow.
Contrary-wise, if you think we're alive, you ought to speak.
I'm sure I'm very sorry.
I was wondering which is the best way out of this wood.
Would you tell me, please?
You've begun wrong.
The first thing in a visit is to say,
"How do you do?"
And shake hands.
I hope you're not much tired.
Why, nohow, but thank you very much for asking.
So much obliged.
You like poetry?
Yes, pretty well.
Some poetry.
But would you tell me first which road leads out of the woods?
What shall I repeat to her?
The Walrus and the
Carpenter is the longest.
"The sun was shining on the sea Shining with all his might
"He did his very best to make
The billows smooth and bright
"And this was odd because it was The middle of the night
"The Walrus and the Carpenter
Were walking close at hand
"They wept like anything to see Such quantities of sand
"'lf this were only cleared away'
They said, 'it would be grand'
"'lf seven maids with seven mops Swept it for half a year
"'Do you suppose,' the Walrus said
"'That they could get it clear?"'
"'I doubt it,' said the
Carpenter And shed a bitter tear"
"'Oh, oyster, come and walk with us, ' The Walrus did beseech
"'A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk Along the briny beach'
"They could not do with more than four To give a hand to each
"The eldest oyster looked at him But never a word he said
"The eldest oyster winked his eye And shook his heavy head
"Meaning to say he did not choose To leave the oyster bed
"But younger oysters hurried up All eager for the treat
"Their coats were brushed
Their faces washed
"Their shoes were clean and neat
"And this was odd because, you know They hadn't any feet
"'The time has come,' the Walrus said 'To talk of many things
"'Of shoes and ships and sealing wax Of cabbages and kings"
"'And why the sea is boiling hot And whether pigs have wings"'
"'A loaf of bread,' the Walrus said 'ls what we chiefly need
"'Pepper and vinegar besides
Are very good indeed
"'Now, if you're ready, oysters dear We can begin to feed'
"'But not on us, ' the oysters cried Turning a little blue
"'After such kindness that would be A dismal thing to do!'
"'The night is fine,' the Walrus said 'Do you admire the view?'
"'I weep for you,' the Walrus said 'I deeply sympathize'
"With sobs and tears he sorted out Those of the largest size
"Holding his pocket handkerchief
Before his streaming eyes
"'Oh, oyster,' said the Carpenter
'You've had a pleasant run
"'Shall we be trotting home again?' But answer came there none
"And this was scarcely odd because They'd eaten every one"
Well, they were both very unpleasant characters.
But at any rate, I'd better be leaving the wood
because it's really getting very dark. Well, goodbye.
Look!
Do you see that?
It's only a rattle.
Only an old rattle, quite old and broken.
I knew it was.
It's spoiled, of course.
My nice new rattle.
Of course, you agree to have a battle?
I suppose so.
Only she must help us to dress up, you know.
Of course!
"Tweedledee and Tweedledum
Agreed to have a battle
"For Tweedledee said Tweedledum
"Had spoiled his nice new rattle
"Just then down flew a monstrous crow As black as a tar barrel
"Which frightened both the heroes so
"They quite forgot their quarrel"
I hope you're good at pinning and tying string.
All this has got to go on somehow or other.
This is to keep my head from being cut off.
You know, one of the most serious things that can happen to one in a battle
is to get one's head cut off.
Do I look very pale?
Well, yes, a little.
I'm very brave generally, only today I happen to have a headache.
Well, I've got a toothache.
I'm far worse than you.
Then you'd both better not fight today.
We must have a bit of a fight.
Let's fight till 6:00 and then have dinner.
There's only one sword, but you can have the umbrella. It's sharper.
Only we must begin quick.
It's getting very, very dark.
And darker and darker.
What a thick black cloud that is, and how fast it comes!
Why, I do believe it's got wings.
It's the crow!
The crow!
May I put your shawl straight for you?
I don't know what's the matter with it.
It's out of temper, I think.
I've pinned it here and I've pinned it there, but there's no pleasing it.
It can't go on straight, you know, if you put all the pins on one side.
And dear me, what a state your hair is in!
Oh, the brush has got entangled in it.
And I lost the comb yesterday.
There, now you look better.
My finger's bleeding.
What's the matter?
Have you pricked your finger?
I haven't pricked it yet, but I soon shall.
When do you expect to do it?
When I fasten my shawl again, the broach will come undone.
Watch out, you're holding it all wrong.
Now you understand the way things happen here.
But why don't you scream now?
Why, I've done all the screaming already.
Now, what would be the good of doing it all over again?
I suppose so.
Well, it's a bit lighter now.
I'm glad that crow is gone.
I hope your finger's better now.
Much better. Better, better, better.
What is it you want to buy?
I should like to buy an egg, please.
I never put things into people's hands.
That would never do.
You must get it for yourself.
What a strange egg!
It keeps growing much faster than it should! Curiouser and curiouser!
It's bigger than a chicken!
Why, it's...
It's Humpty-Dumpty!
Don't stand there staring at me as if I were an egg.
Tell me your name and your business.
My name is Alice.
It's a stupid enough name.
What does it mean?
Must a name mean something?
Of course it must.
My name means the shape I am, and a right handsome shape it is.
With your name, you might be any shape.
Why do you sit out here all alone?
Because there's nobody with me.
Did you think
I couldn't answer that?
Ask another.
Don't you think you'd be safer on the ground?
That wall is so very narrow.
Of course I don't think so.
Why, if I ever did fall off,
which there's no chance of, but if I did...
If I did fall, the King has promised me...
To send all his horses and all his men.
Ah, so, you know. All his horses and all his men.
They'd pick me up again in a minute, they would.
However, this conversation is going on a little too fast.
Let's go back to the last remark but one.
I'm afraid I can't quite remember it.
In that case, we start afresh,
and it's my turn to choose a subject.
How old did you say you were?
Twelve years and four months.
Wrong. You never said a word like it.
I thought you meant,
"How old are you?"
If I'd meant that,
I'd have said that.
Twelve years and four months.
An uncomfortable sort of age.
Now, my advice would have been to leave off at 12, but it's too late now.
What a beautiful belt!
Or is it a beautiful collar?
It is a most provoking thing when a person doesn't know a collar from a belt.
I know it's very ignorant of me.
It's a collar, child, and a beautiful one, as you say.
It's a present from the White King and Queen.
Is it really?
They gave it to me for an un-birthday present.
I beg your pardon?
I am not offended, and it isn't respectable to beg.
I mean, what is an un-birthday present?
A present given when it isn't your birthday, of course.
I like birthday presents best.
You don't know what you're talking about.
How many days are there in a year?
Three hundred and sixty-five.
And how many birthdays have you?
One.
And if you take that from 365, what remains?
Three hundred and sixty-four, of course.
Well then, there are 364 days when you might get un-birthday presents.
Certainly.
And only one for birthday presents.
That's glory for you!
I don't know what you mean by glory.
Of course you don't, till I tell you.
I meant there's a nice knock-down argument for you.
But glory doesn't mean that.
When I use a word, it means what I choose it to mean, neither more or less.
The question is whether you can make words mean different things.
The question is, which is to be the master, you or the word? That's all.
However, I can manage the whole lot.
Impenetrability, that's what I say.
Would you tell me, please, what that means?
I meant by impenetrability that we've had enough of the subject, and it would be just as well if you would mention what you mean to do next,
as I suppose you don't mean to stop here all the rest of your life.
Fancy it meaning all that.
You seem very clever at explaining words, sir.
Would you kindly tell me the meaning of a poem called Jabberwocky?
I read it a long time ago.
I can, but I won't.
That's all. Goodbye.
Goodbye, till we meet again.
I shouldn't know you if we did meet.
You're so exactly like other people.
The face is what one generally goes by.
That's just it. Your face is the same as everybody's.
The two eyes, so.
Nose in the middle, mouth under.
Now, if your two eyes were on the same side of your nose, or your mouth on the top, that would be some help.
It wouldn't look nice.
Wait till you've tried.
Watch out!
Help! Help! I'm falling!
Tell the King!
Tell him to bring his horses and his men!
Help!
What happened?
We ran into each other,
Your Majesty.
Good. I rather fancied something like that had happened.
Oh, Your Majesty,
Humpty-Dumpty fell off the wall!
I know, I know.
Four-thousand, two-hundred and seven of my soldiers are on the way.
Two without horses.
If all this King's horses and men
can't put him back together again, nobody can.
I'm glad Humpty will be all right. I was worried.
Well, don't be.
Look along the road and tell me if you can see either of my three messengers.
I see nobody on the road.
Oh, I only wish
I had such eyes!
To be able to see nobody, and at that distance!
Oh!
It's too, too bad!
Can I help you, sir?
On or off?
You are on.
In a short time
I shall be off again.
I'm so sorry. Are you the King's messenger?
I am the White Knight.
I see you're admiring my little box.
It's my own invention, to keep clothes and sandwiches in.
You see, I carry it upside down so the rain can't come in.
But the things can get out.
Do you know the lid is open?
Then if all the things have fallen out, the box is no use without them.
Can you guess why I did that?
I can't imagine.
In hopes some bees may make a nest in it. Then I should get the honey.
But you've got a beehive, or something like one, fastened to the saddle.
It's a very good beehive, too.
One of the best kind, but not a single bee has come near it yet.
That other thing's a mousetrap.
I suppose the mice keep the bees out
or the bees keep the mice out. I don't know which.
It isn't very likely there would be any mice on a horse's back.
Not very likely, perhaps,
but I don't choose to have them running all about.
You see, I'm well provided for everything.
That's the reason the horse has those anklets around his feet.
What are they for?
To guard against the bites of sharks. It's my own invention.
But let's go on. I'll go with you to the edge of the wood.
I hope you've got your hair well-fastened on.
Only the usual way.
That's hardly enough. You see, the wind is so strong here.
It's strong as soup.
Have you invented a plan for keeping the hair from being blown off?
Not yet, but I have a plan for keeping the hair from falling off.
I should like to hear it very much.
First, you take an upright stick, then you make your hair creep up it like a vine.
Now, the reason hair falls off is because it hangs down.
Things never fall upward, you know. It's my own invention.
You may try it if you like.
I'm a great hand at inventing things.
Now, I daresay you noticed the last time you picked me up,
I was looking rather thoughtful.
You were a little grave.
Well, just then I was inventing a new way of getting over a gate.
Would you like to hear it?
Very much, indeed.
Well, I'll tell you how I came to think of it. I said to myself,
"The only difficulty is with the feet.
"The head's high enough already."
Now, first I put my head on top of the gate, then my head's high enough, then I stand on my head, then my feet are high enough.
Then I'm over.
Sir Knight!
If there were only a gate down here,
I'd be in excellent position to cross it.
How can you go on talking so quietly with your head in a ditch?
What does it matter where my body happens to be?
My mind goes on working all the same.
In fact, I once invented a new pudding during the meat course.
In time to have it cooked for the next course? Hmm.
That was quick work.
Well, not the next course.
In fact, I don't believe that pudding ever was cooked.
What did you mean it to be made of?
Well, it began with blotting paper.
That wouldn't be very nice, I'm afraid.
Not very nice alone, but imagine how good it would be mixed with other things, such as gunpowder and sealing wax.
And here I must leave you.
This is the end of the wood.
You've only a few yards to go.
Down the hill, across that little brook, and then you'll be a queen.
At last!
But you'll stay and see me off first?
I shan't be long.
You'll wait?
Of course I'll wait.
I think it'll encourage me.
Thank you very much for coming so far out of your way.
For that, I shall expect you to cry a good deal as I go.
The poor, dear Knight.
He's the nicest person yet.
Well, here I am.
What's this?
A crown! A golden crown!
I'm a queen!
I'm a queen!
How dare you say that you're a queen.
What right have you to call yourself so?
You can't be a queen, you know,
till you've passed the proper examination, and the sooner we begin it, the better. Be seated.
Yes, Your Majesty.
I'm ready, Your Majesties.
Can you do addition?
Now what's one and one and one and one and one and one, one and one?
I don't know.
I lost count.
She can't do addition.
Can you answer any useful questions? How is bread made?
I know that.
You take some flour...
Where do you pick the flower, in a garden or in the hedges?
It isn't picked at all, it's ground.
But how many acres of ground?
I wish you wouldn't leave out so many things!
Oh, dear.
You know any languages?
What's the French for "fiddle-de-dee"?
Fiddle-de-dee's not English.
Whoever said it was?
Well, if you'll tell me what language fiddle-de-dee is,
I'll tell you the French for it.
Queens never make bargains!
I'm so sleepy.
She's tired, poor thing.
So, smooth her hair, lend her your nightcap and sing her a soothing lullaby.
I haven't any nightcap, and I don't know any soothing lullabies.
I'll have to do it myself.
Hush-a-bye lady in Alice's lap
When the feast's ready we've time for a nap
When the feast's over we'll go to the ball
Red Queen and White Queen and Alice and all
Now that you know the words, sing it through to me. I'm sleepy, too.
Now what am I to do?
Do wake up.
To the looking-glass world
It was Alice that said
"I've a scepter in hand
"I've a crown on my head"
No admittance until week after next.
Why... Why, how dare you!
Fill up the glasses as quick as you can
And sprinkle the table
With buttons and bran
Put cats in the coffee and mice in the tea
And welcome Queen Alice with 30 times three
Put cats in the coffee and mice in the tea
And welcome Queen Alice
With 30 times three
Then put in the glasses, molasses and ink
And anything else that is pleasant to drink
Mix sand with the cider
And wool with the wine
And welcome Queen Alice
With 90 times nine
Mix sand with the cider
And wool with the wine
And welcome Queen Alice
With 90 times 90 times
90 times nine
You've missed the soup and fish! Serve the roast!
You seem a little shy. Let me introduce you to that leg of mutton.
Alice, Leg of Mutton.
Leg of Mutton, Alice.
How do you do?
May I give you a slice?
Certainly not!
It isn't etiquette to cut somebody you've been introduced to.
Remove the roast!
Will you, won't you, will you, won't you...
Please don't introduce the Pudding, or we shall get no dinner at all.
May I give you some?
Pudding, Alice.
Alice, Pudding.
What impertinence!
How would you like it if I were to cut a slice out of you, you creature?
Make a remark.
It's ridiculous to leave all the conversation to the Pudding.
Well...
You'd better prepare.
We're about to drink to your health. Queen Alice's health!
Queen Alice's health!
Queen Alice!
Queen Alice!
She ought to make a speech. A speech!
So she ought!
A speech! A speech!
A speech!
A speech!
Speech!
Speech!
I rise to return thanks.
Take care! Something's going to happen! Something's going to happen!
Here I am!
There was a looking-glass room, and you were the Red Queen.
There was a whole looking-glass country.
I'll get it!
No, no, never mind.
I'll get it.
I think it's for me.
Maybe it's for me.
Yeah, well i'll let you know.
Hello?
Good morning.
It's 11 o'clock.
Assassinated! Well give me the details!
Are all newspaper men lunatics?
Near saint gregory's?
Hey, get into your dutch.
Prince... prince dittleboomer, whatever his name is... that guy who's gonna marry sally parker has just been assassinated.
Uh huh. In front of the cathedral.
Shot through the heart with an old copy of the new york chronicle.
It's 11:00. you see, michael, my sweetheart, i left the call.
Barney, you say things at times in a way that hurts.
Now we've covered assignments together for our dear little papers all over the world.
Share and share alike.
Yeah. Two for you and one for me.
Now those are the things that cut deeply.
Then i'll try to think of some more of them.
Go on. Get to the tag.
We've both got to cover two tame assignments, haven't we?
Yep. A spandermann stratosphere flight and the wedding of sally parker to that phony prince.
And for some bright reason, you want to cover the spandermann hop.
Well, you don't like the baron, sweetheart, he's a publicity pest.
So why do you want the assignment?
Well, i used to fly a bit.
I'm interested in aviation.
And you think maybe a real piece of news might break there, huh?
I give you my word.
If anything breaks, i'll pass it on to you before i cable it in.
You could have been sitting in the theatre the night lincoln was shot and you wouldn't have covered me.
I'd have told you, i swear.
Oh, yeah. You'd have told me lincoln shot booth.
Call it.
Heads.
Tails.
You get parker.
Parker... hey, mike. Take it off.
We want to see the rabbits.
You can't take a rib, huh?
Follow that cab!
Is everything over, sir?
Over? It's just started!
That's the parker girl, wasn't it?
The wedding isn't over, is it?
She looked to me like she'd been crying.
I thought she was laughing.
Eighth floor, please.
Hold it a minute for the baron.
Hello.
How do you do?
I thought you were covering little sal's meeting festivities.
I am.
What are you doing here?
Well i finished my story, mr. Pells.
Only the unimaginative type of newspaper man like yourself would sit through the ordeal.
I'm off for a little recreation.
Oh, you're dealing with a superior mentality, poppo.
Where did you steal those flowers?
A slight case of romance, mr. Pells, something that'll never come into your life.
Now listen, mike, whenever you get polite this way you're sitting on something hot.
Now be a pal, will you?
You doubt me, mr. Pells?
No, i don't doubt you.
I just think you're lying.
Mein apartment!
Baron! I'd like to have you meet mike anthony.
Just another reporter on your trail like me.
Ah, a reporter!
Yeah! Wants a special interview
with the new york chronicle. Their best man.
They took him off the parker wedding to cover you.
Delighted... flowers for the baroness and everything.
That's the chronicle, for you.
Baron, this isn't exactly...
america is waiting for my flight through the stratosphere, ja?
Look, baron, mr. Pells here... yes, the latest photograph of the baroness and myself.
The official takeoff is this afternoon.
I have more here.
Yes, that's very nice, baron, but... pells: Well, you wouldn't want to go, would you?
Where are your manners?
You'll excuse my wife, please.
She's having her usual salt rub.
Excellent before i'm flying.
Pells: What a story- conditioning.
Mind and body must be fit.
Noble pair battles elements.
Saxons conquer the ether.
Ah, exactly. You see, the fleeing abarelle, an invention of my own, you have photographers downstairs, of course.
Yes, yes.
We should leave the hotel dressed for the flight.
The management has kindly cooperated in the publicity.
Well, look, baron, if you'll cooperate for just one minute... you see the oxygen helmets are not like any others.
They present a radical departure... yes, well i'm about to present a radical departure myself.
Hey, was ist?
Look, hey look, baron, mr. Pells there, he's just being funny.
I'm not a reporter, and i just happened to remember that i left the water running in the bathtub.
Thanks a lot, baron.
I'll see you later.
No, no, no. Where are you going, mr. Pells?
Well, as a matter of fact, baron, i just remembered that... whoa, mr. Pells, don't go, don't go.
I have yet to explain my whole purpose in this plan.
Where we go, and how we go, and why we go.
What's a matter, sally parker?
Take them away!
Do you hear me?
Take them right back to igor and throw them in his contemptible little face, and you can tell him and his queasy old uncle if they want anybody to sign a marriage settlement, they can get another girl.
But, miss parker... he wanted me for myself, did he?
Only i had to buy him in the bargain.
Well i'd buy his whole russian swamp if i was sure he didn't go with it.
That's what i'd do.
You can tell him that!
And you can tell his uncles and his aunts and his sisters and his cousins and... who are you?
Who, me? Oh, i... i just want to help you.
How much will that cost me?
Or do you happen to be a reporter?
A reporter?
Well whatever gave you that idea?
Then you must be from that blini i nearly married.
You go back and tell him that i'll... i must admit it sally parker, i... well i'm just somebody that's known you and thought of you ever since, well ever since i saw your picture in the rotogravure section as a debutante.
That was a long time ago.
Well, it wasn't that long ago.
Well i mean that it seems that way to me, not really meeting you.
Well, today i went to saint gregory's to look at you for the last time, that's all.
Sort of a silent good-bye.
Do you expect me to believe that?
No, i mean... uh, well i know it sounds a little... well a little elsie dinsmore, but it's true.
Oh, oh, it's nice to know that... it's nice to know that someone else besides my board of directors and 9 million reporters really cares about what happens to me.
But all my governesses and guardians never stopped me from fighting my own battles, and i'll take care of this one, too.
If that's that dear, charming attendee of royal bread pudding, i'll tell him a thing or two.
No, no, no.
Wait a minute.
That might be reporters.
Reporters? Buzzards.
All right, let them come up.
I'll give them some real headlines for once:
How sally parker found romance.
So much down, so much for every kiss.
Oh, oh i'm sorry.
I thought you'd be pretty tired of all this cheap notoriety.
I'm sick to my stomach of reporters.
I've been blinded by their flashlights ever since i can remember.
They put my impacted wisdom tooth on the front page.
This oughta make newspaper history!
Oh, you poor kid, you're all tied up in... knots.
You oughta get away by yourself for awhile and think things over.
That's what igor said.
Dear, sweet, romantic igor.
He was to be my... my escape, and he turned out to be... oh, i feel so cheap and ashamed of myself.
So it's igor, is it?
You'd like to hear some more, would you?
Miss parker, wait.
He may not be alone.
Sally, my baby love.
My baby love... don't you baby love me, and don't you touch me.
She means it, your excellency.
But my darling, what did i say? What did i do?
You scurrilous little scavenger.
But my sweet one, my... i'm not at advantage.
Have i met this gentleman?
Don't be silly. Where would you ever meet a gentleman?
My little treasure, i mean my baby love, you're the sweetest thing.
We do know each other.
No, no, no. Never had the pleasure, i'm sure.
I'm positive your face is... i warn you if you continue to foul the air i breathe-out... but my darling, for why are you angry?
My uncle only asked you to sign a little paper to insure our happiness.
I don't want any insurance.
I'm cancelling my order and they can put you back in macy's window.
Yes, $5 million is hardly a bargain, your excellency.
It was not
$5 million, only 3.
Oh, what? How much?
$3 million only and my darling becomes the princess.
We met in berlin, yes?
No, no, i'm sorry old man.
But i don't want it.
Well, but she... my darling, come back to the cathedral, then to my people, to my country.
Your country?
Your people?
A lot of second-hand sturgeon looking for a river to lay an egg in.
Oh, no, no, now really, miss parker, chelyabinsk's a charming little state.
Well, they're financially unsound, i must admit, but a member of the league of nations... aha, now i know him.
In geneva, it was.
But darling, do you realize who this man is?
He is... why did you do that?
He's said just about enough to you.
You... you didn't kill him, did you?
I don't think so.
Woman: The is jeannine, mademoiselle.
Jeannine! Your maid.
Well, here they come.
What next?
I don't know. Everything's worse than ever now.
There will be police.
I hit him pretty hard.
Oh, i've got to get away now. I'm all weak inside.
You said you would help me. Will you?
Look, would you like to get away from this?
Away from everything and people, where nobody can reach you?
Oh, yes, yes. How?
Where you'll have peace and quiet?
No cousins, no aunts, no uncles, no.. No princes, no... no reporters until all of this blows over?
Oh, i've wanted that all my life.
Will you trust me, sally parker?
Can i?
Where's the back way?
Here. Come on.
Oh. We'll meet them downstairs.
Maybe they won't recognize us.
Here, here. Sit tight.
If anybody comes, make a noise like a broom.
All right.
Plates under the arms, plates under the small of the back, and plates under the stomach.
You back now?
Yes.
How is your bath tub?
Oh, fine, baron, fine. How's yours?
How come? What foul, cheap, underhanded... why, mr. Pells, what do you mean foul, cheap, underhanded?
You didn't think i was going to miss out on your story, did you, baron?
Say, this is an ingenious outfit.
You see it is electrical airline with plates.
Plates under the arms, plates under the small of the back, yes, yes, it's excellent tailoring.
Bond street?
Say, by the way, is your wife still pickled?
Was pickled?
I mean, is she still in the salt rub?
Ja, ja. She's in her apartment, sir.
Oh, yes. Yes, that's fine.
Say, hold this a minute, will you?
Hold?
I do hope igor can get sally to change her mind.
Well you know how persuasive igor can be.
Man: Here they come now!
All: They they are.
Happy landing.
Good luck, baron.
Airport, baron?
Sure, sure, hurry, hurry!
We are late!
Airport.
All: Bye! Bye, baron.
Pells: Hey, let me out of here you, mike anthony!
Let me out of here!
You big double-crossing hun, come back here!
Come back here!
I'll get you, you son of a gun!
Hey, come back here, anthony!
Come back here, you... baron:
Pells, let me out of here.
You get yourself out.
I'm no laundry man.
Get me out of here!
I beg your pardon.
Baron: Help! Help!
Mach schnell!
Hurry, hurry please.
We are late for the take off.
Chauffeur: I'm giving her all she can take, baron.
What are you writing?
A cable to my mother.
It's her birthday tomorrow.
Oh, that's sweet. She'll be glad to hear from you.
Oh, she'll be tickled pink.
When you leave us, send this cable at once, collect.
Right-o, baron.
Back, please, get back.
Flowers, for the baroness.
Right-o.
Oh, baroness, baroness!
Happy landing.
Michael: I wonder what all those gadgets are for?
Let go!
Hey! Stop!
Follow that plane!
Yes, sir. Are you crazy?
Yes! I'll get you, mike anthony!
Mein instruments, mein equipment are ruined.
A life's work all over again.
Well, we run along.
As soon as i locate the plane, i'll get in touch with you as a matter of routine.
Good day, baron.
Thank you.
Good day, baron.
Then you, men.
Thank you.
Well, that went over pretty well, i think.
At least it's something you didn't bungle.
Steven, i swear, it all happened so... shut up. That plane must be found.
I know, i know.
Telephone colleen humbert.
Get fouche in paris.
One of them must locate the plane, you hear?
I'll go down to the field and stand by.
You call me the first news and i take off at once.
If anyone gets to that plane you're through!
Do you understand?
It must be found.
Right.
I hope you didn't kill him.
Who? Kill what?
Igor.
Oh, that's all right. All snakes live till sundown.
Stop worrying.
Look around for some peace and quiet to land in.
How fast are we going?
Well, we're either up 2,100 feet and going 175 miles an hour, or we're up 175 feet and going 2,100 miles an hour.
Whimsical little airplane, isn't it.
You know, there is something queer about this ship.
Well i don't mean to be critical, but it was probably all right before that take off.
No, no. I mean there are no oxygen tanks for these comic helmets to connect with.
You know, i'm beginning to think the baron and baroness are phonies.
I wonder where we are?
Get out those maps there, will you?
Oh... what color is it down there?
It's sort of a pinkish brown.
Pinkish brown?
We're over persia.
Let me see if i can find france.
If i remember right, it's a kind of a green.
I wonder who admired the baroness so much?
Amorous-looking little gentlemen.
Ah, a note!
He must woo her with geography or something because... say, what on earth is this?
Let's see.
What?
Number x-2593, foreign office confiden- wait a minute.
If this nightmare gets any worse... what's wrong?
Plenty. Say, this is an admiralty chart.
Coast defense stations, range of firing, the whole works.
Phonies? The baron and baroness are spies.
You mean this flight and everything is... is just a hop to smuggle this out of england.
Say, we're small prize, sally.
Do you realize what a story this will make?
What do you mean, story?
Uh... i mean, well, i mean what a story it will make to tell our grandchildren.
We're tied up in intrigue.
But i don't want to be tied up in anything.
We're international.
I don't want to be international.
I just want things to stop happening to me.
Well, don't worry. I'll handle this when the time comes.
And nothing more is going to happen to you.
Except that... except that... except what?
Except that we're out of gas, and we're almost down!
So you better hold tight.
Here we go!
Don't hold on to that!
We have landed!
Are you hurt?
No, chock full of peace and quiet.
Where are we?
Madame, this is france.
Stop annoying the livestock.
Don't be vulgar, mr. Anthony.
It happens to be this woolen undershirt, that's all.
Trains run to paris, you know.
Trains, remember?
Choo, choo, choo!
I don't know why i keep explaining things to you, but railroad stations have a habit of being watched.
Besides, you wanted the simple life.
Peace and quiet.
Well here it is.
You're a fine one.
You profess admiration for me, you tell me you want to help.
I put myself in your hands and now look what.
Well, what? You wanted my help and you got it.
Say, you don't think i enjoy playing cops and robbers all over europe with a... just exactly who do you think you're talking to?
I'm talking to a fairly attractive dame who's got too much dough for her own good.
Just between you and me, i'm beginning to think that prince is a pretty lucky boy.
You've said just about enough, mr. Anthony.
Too much!
I don't need your help and advice or anyone else's.
As far as i'm concerned, you can take a running front dive off this wagon.
And it's all right with me if i never see you again.
Oh yeah?
Oh, where are you going?
I can take a hint.
I'll be seeing you.
Paris in spring.
But... but you can't leave me here with all these cabbages.
Well this constant nagging will have to stop.
All right.
It has stopped.
And no more beefing.
Not a beef.
Ok.
In mike you trust.
In mike i trust.
You know, it's odd your following me all that time.
You're reasonably presentable and clean.
It's a wonder you didn't get yourself introduced.
You don't know the right people.
Then it must be destiny.
Destiny?
Mm-hmm.
It's a story.
A great story.
Man: Boy, he's sure steamed up about something.
Second man: I'll say he is. And everybody's gonna hear about it.
Rose, it'll stand another column on the woman's angle.
Put yourself in sally's place.
Jake, tell wesson to wire anthony $2,000.
Union agency, paris.
Right.
What a man, anthony.
He's making newspaper history.
If the circulation department don't erect him a statue, i'll dip myself in bronze.
Hurry up with that new lead, wally.
Right.
Sit here and don't say a word.
You're from the country and dumb, see?
How's this?
I hope you're kidding.
Say, where are you going?
It's all right.
Well, for the love of pete.
I'm sorry, but you'll first have to see the man at the... mike! I wondered when you'd turn up.
Hi, jim. What the devil are you doing... any money from home?
Sure, but what...?
All right, lead me to it, and give me your fastest stenographer.
I've got to send a cable home.
Got a match, pal?
No.
No.
Pretty big boy. In town to see the girls, huh?
No.
Tell mike barney says judgement day is here.
Oh... hey, mike, a man just came in and told me... we can get out of here in a minute.
I got to get this cable off to mother.
I know, but... how much?
48 francs.
Hey, look at the window.
What?
Look at the window.
Is that the man?
No, but barney says judgement day is here.
Huh? What?
Back way, where?
Quick!
Through there.
Good-bye.
Very clever, mr. Anthony.
Very astute.
It took the mind of a child to follow your tracks.
Well, well, barney, old pal.
You're a gift from the gods.
Mind over matter, my friend.
Yours the muscle, mine the brain.
Listen, miss parker... hey, you run along, sally.
We'll catch up with you.
Listen, he's the man... you bet i am!
Yeah, yeah, sure, sure.
He's our pal.
He's gonna help us.
Go on, sally.
Now, listen, barney, don't be insane.
This story's big enough for both of us.
What was i doing in that dark closet, hunting mice?
Oh, don't be catty.
Now listen, barney, she doesn't know who i am.
She hates newspapers and boys like us.
If you crack now, we're both sunk.
Come on.
I'm sticking like summer underwear.
Sally: Hey, michael!
Michael! Here they come!
Michael: Come on! Hop in!
All right, captain flag, baby's with you.
We can wait until the police locate that stolen delivery truck.
And that's the way a couple of princeton men stick together, hey barney, old pal?
Old pal?
Sure, you don't have to worry about this egg.
Why, we were inseparable at princeton.
They used to call him my shadow.
Huh. He still is.
Sure, one for all and all for one.
And every man for himself now and then.
You'll excuse me, gentlemen, this is too good a chance to be loose.
All for one and one for all, huh?
You ever hear of the odious career of benedict arnold?
Yes, yes. But later document proved benny to have been a very much misunderstood man.
History says different.
No, i'm on the level now. Honest, barney.
I believe you, anthony, you hope.
Cops!
Hold tight, sally.
Hey!
* she'll be comin' round the mountain when she comes *
* she'll be comin' round the mountain *
* she'll be comin' round the mountain when she comes *
* she'll be comin'... * now what?
We're out of gas.
Don't tell me they still use that one at princeton.
Is this on the level?
I never heard two such suspicious people in my life!
We gotta get out and walk.
Where?
To the end of the rainbow. Who cares?
Come on, the open road, barnabas.
The broad highway, madam.
Come aramis, come pothos!
With a cow field for a couch and clouds for a coverlet.
Wresting the world with a song on our lips and blade in our hands.
One for all and all for one.
Sally, do you mind if i speak with romeo a minute?
Why?
Men, talk, you know.
Go pick yourself a daisy.
Oh... what's on your stagnant mind? Shhh... i discovered this while she was dressing.
What?
Look.
What?
Look.
Where?
Hey, you!
You dirty, double
- crossing snake, you!
One for all, huh?!
Good by, dear. I'll write you in a day or two.
Pells: Hey, if you let me out of here... good-bye, dear.
Pells:
Hey, sally!
Hey, miss parker, let me tell you something!
Sally! Hey! Parker, this guy's a reporter!
Oh, now wait a minute, pells.
That's too much.
Enough is enough.
You can't hear him now.
I thought he was your friend.
Well, he used to be, but today he'd sell his sister for a turkish dime.
Turned out to be a newspaper man, sally.
A reporter?
Yeah, foreign correspondent.
New york gazette, or something like that, and he's on your trail.
I thought i'd string him along back there until we got out of that jam.
You know, i feel sorry for him.
Well, don't. You can't trust a thing he says.
Well the next time he meets you, he'll tell you stories about me.
He'll even have me a reporter before he's through.
No, i mean i feel sorry for anyone who has to earn his living that way.
No self respecting man could accept money for prying into people's private lives.
No, no, and they don't earn very much at that.
Is that anthony a newspaper man?
I got it! I got a topper for the whole thing!
Who will be sally's ideal man?
Royal prince or a lonely reporter?
Will old world sophistication win out over new world virility?
We run a contest!
Prizes for best letters!
Get it, wally!
Snap out with a lead right away.
We'll float an extra on this.
Dave, get wally's story on the paris cable.
I want this to break all over europe!
Oh, excuse me.
Lift me up.
I'm too tired, but i'll lie down beside you.
Old wine, old friends, old jokes.
It's too fantastic!
Believe it or not, but i think i see a beautiful gasoline station with a lot of rooms in it.
I'll bet there are beds in those rooms.
Don't tell me you see what i see?
We can't both be crazy!
That's what you think.
Hmm. Looks like we're gonna spend the night with some pretty important ghosts.
All the louis, madame de maintenon, richelieu..
I'd rather enjoy meeting richelieu.
I want to see if he really looks like george arliss.
Ah. A bottle of milk for marie antoinette's bath.
If that was left for her, it's sour by now.
No luck, michael.
What caretaker would open windows?
No sleep for sally tonight.
Lose not heart, fair lady.
This may mean the guillotine, but here goes.
What was that? Shhh.
Bismarck, quiet.
Down. Stop growling.
Come along.
We better go see.
Nice bismarck.
Sit up. Beg. Beg.
We better take a gun.
It's empty.
Come, bismarck, come.
Come. Come on.
Good boy.
Give me a hand. It's awfully creepy in here.
Mike!
What's the matter?
Right there!
What?
That man!
That's not a man, that's a statue.
You're just saying that.
Yes, i am just saying that.
You know, we're really in terrible danger.
You're right.
That is just a statue, mike.
Madame de maintenon's apartment.
Hey, we can't resist this, sally.
De maintenon.
Louis xiv's favorite lady.
He did right for the gal. He married her.
A peasant girl born in a prison, and she lived to be surrounded by all this.
A queen.
I hear she was surrounded by the king the most of the time.
Oh... her bedroom.
Think of it.
She ruled the destiny of france, of a whole nation, from this very room.
You're wrong there.
Louis ruled france, and she ruled louis.
I'll bet she really loved him.
The atmosphere of the room does kind of... well, kind of get into you, doesn't it?
They say that walls have ears.
If they could only speak.
They are speaking.
I can tell you exactly what louis is saying.
He's a man of few words but with a very definite objective.
Steady, mr. Anthony?
No, no, no.
Listen to him.
He's st... st... stuttering a little.
Her beauty makes him n... n... nervous.
I know.
And listen to her.
She's bidding him good night because she's very sleepy.
Hear her yawn?
Was that a yawn? Oh, i thought it was just a nice deep sigh.
I don't know know where you're going to rest your tousled little head, mr. Anthony, but i'm going to sleep right here.
Well, shall i make up the upper, madame?
I wonder what louis would do in a case like this?
Come on.
Good night, mr. Anthony.
This place must be alive with beds.
Louis?
What do you advise?
Oh, you won't be very far away, will you?
You'll be all right.
If anybody disturbs you it'll be louis himself.
Good night, mike.
Good night, sally.
Who is it?
Louis.
L... louis who?
Pick a number from one to 10.
Louis xiv.
Madame was trucking?
His majesty is several centuries ahead of himself.
I was minueting.
May i have the next one?
After all, i am your queen.
Your majesty, madame.
Down, bismarck, down.
These people live here.
They're friends of mine.
Who are you?
Guess.
Little bo peep.
No, but you're warm.
We give up. Who?
The caretaker of your palace, your majesty.
I have been for 46 years.
Bismarck and i have spent every night here and enjoy every minute of it.
And all the fun we have had with you and all the others ghosts.
All the other ghosts?
Then you think we are ghosts, too?
Oh, oul, oul, oul.
I know you are.
The ghost of king louis xiv and madame de maintenon.
Your majesty, madame, may i present bismarck?
Who is bismarck?
And where is he?
He's my dog.
He's right here at my feet.
Bismarck, roll over, like a good dog.
Isn't he clever?
I've never seen anything like it.
Mike, let's get out of here.
If you will pardon my saying so, your majesty, you have gone very rusty in your minuet.
Your form, after all these years, is a way off.
Let me illustrate.
May i have your hand, madame?
Couldn't we just sit this one out?
No, no, no.
Go right ahead.
His majesty commands.
Come on, swing it, daddy. Swing it!
The king can do no wrong.
Don't be afraid, madame.
It is not loaded.
No, no, no.
Not at your head!
This gun is crazy!
The gun's crazy?
You're all right.
Oul. There, you see?
Don't worry, madame.
I'll tell them you shot in self defense.
Mike, if you don't get that man out of here, you're going to have an awful hysterical woman on your hands.
I'll try.
It's getting kind of late, isn't it?
Oh, what time is it, your majesty?
5 minutes of 12:00.
Oh. We must hurry.
You see, at 12:00 i turn into a pumpkin.
Happy halloween.
Merci, madame.
Your majesty, have bismarck and i your permission to withdraw?
Well, yes, yes, if you insist.
Come, bismarck.
Anthony: Oh, by the way, if bismarck there ever has puppies, i wish you'd send me one.
Shall be honor.
Good night, your majesties.
May you find great joy in your return to fontainebleau.
Come, bismarck.
Mike, i need some air.
I hope there's enough for both of us.
Funny little man.
A happy little man in a world all his own.
And i'm here, too.
London, marriage settlements, unpleasant people... they all seem very far away right now.
Far away?
Yeah, that reminds me.
Good night.
Mike!
Where are you going?
Why, i've got to find some place to rest this tousled head of mine, remember?
Oh, but you can't leave me like this, you can't go- hello.
Oh, i always knew someday about somebody like you.
You know, i've known people i've liked and some i've disliked.
I've hated a few and thought i loved a couple, but, i've never known anyone i could trust up till now.
Look sally, a fella has to make a living, understand?
Such a nice living.
Two can live happier than one.
Well, it isn't that exactly, but, well, i've had a job all my life.
I knew you did something. What?
Well, i'm a- i'm a writer.
How wonderful, darling.
What do you write about?
Oh, i write about people, you know, things.
What sort of things?
Have i read them?
I want to learn everything you've ever written by heart.
Well, sally, i might as well admit it.
What?
That i'm about to crucify myself.
But you suddenly turned out to be the only girl this side of the moon.
Oh, let's skip anything else.
Everything else.
Louis?
The 13th, 14th, or 15th?
Barney the first.
How did you get here?
I came in through the plumbing.
Well, then you can get out the same way.
I know all about you.
You do, huh?
Yes.
Well, listen, where is that double-headed cobra?
Where's that python?
If you're speaking of snakes, mr. Barney whatever-your-name-is, let me tell you this- try to seal me in a boxcar, will he?
Lifts my clothes, will he?
Well, let me tell you about that.
Oh, you don't look any sillier than usual.
And get off my bed!
You don't know about that chimpanzee, do you?
You don't know he's a newspaper man, do you?
Well, how'd you like to look at
the paris edition of the new york chronicle and see that dirty snake.
Running true to form, aren't you?
Well, you'd better run away and hide, little man.
It's open season on rodents around here.
Now listen, parker, i can get tough, too, and i haven't had my breakfast yet.
But i'm gonna put you wise.
The panels are of solid gold leaf.
Fashioned in the post-renaissance era by- who's that?
The madame herself?
What occurs here?
What you do here?
They should listen to me- sally, come on, come on, we gotta get out of here!
But mike, this horrendous hoodlum won't leave me!
Ah, let her wallow in some more smooch, eh?
Hello, barney old pal, how are you?
It is forbidden to sleep here!
Now, don't worry, barney, we'll get you out of here!
Where are my pants?
Who are all these people?
Oh, you're a bunch of pigeons!
Where are my clothes, mr. Underwear snatcher?
Hey, look! The law!
Come on! Come on!
It's the fastest way to the street!
Follow, monsieur!
My clothes!
Hey! Come back here!
Hey!
Ahhh!
A ghost in daylight!
Hey!
It's all right, you can come out now.
If i didn't love you quite so much, darling, i'd make believe you weren't with me.
You look like a very sweet, half-witted hillbilly.
I'm a hungry hillbilly.
There's a restaurant.
Right after breakfast, i'm going to buy the palace of fontainebleau just for us.
Ghosts and all.
Oh!
Bismarck!
Come on, come on.
Come on, get in here and behave yourself.
Shhh. Don't look now, you know who just passed by?
Who?
King louis the 14th and madame de maintenon.
I asked you not to take that last drink.
We'll have two of everything.
Yes, and one copy of the paris edition
of the new york chronicle.
What's the matter, darling?
Well, do i look as if there were anything the matter?
It's all over you.
All over me is right.
Well, we who are about to die, salute you.
Oh no.
Oh yes.
I tried to tell you last night.
You unbelievable, you incredibly unthinkable, you sheer, unadulterated worm!
Go ahead, i deserve it, all the adjectives.
Sally confides dreams to anthony.
Why you're something that flies out of a jar when they take the lid off.
Sally, i don't know anything about that contest, and i'll make them kill it.
So this is your dear, sweet mother, is it?
How do you do, mrs. Anthony?
Isn't that cute?
Little michael tearing wings off grasshoppers.
The only girl this side of the moon, and i believed you.
I tried to tell you last night, but i couldn't.
You don't know what last night meant to me.
How can i tell what last night meant to you
until i see the next issue of the chronicle?
Not more than 500 words, and be sure and write on only one side of the paper.
Mr. Anthony'll write on the back.
He writes on the backs of barns.
Well, what are you waiting for?
There must be a cable office around here somewhere?
Aren't you afraid you'll miss the next edition?
Taxi fare to paris.
And, well i, i'm sorry.
No, he'll come back.
You mind if i sit down, ms. Parker?
Why not?
It doesn't make any difference, all kinds of people have sat here.
Mike just stepped out a second, i guess, to find a cable, huh?
He can step out of a balloon, as far as i'm concerned.
So, you finally read your report card, huh?
Pretty brutal stuff, if you ask me.
Hey, wait a minute, you're a reporter, aren't you, barney?
Me? Now listen, ms. Parker, if that anthony guy's been handing you a lot of silly stuff about me- look.
It goes pretty hard with one reporter if he loses his story to another reporter, doesn't he?
Well, yeah, i guess so- all right, then if you're not a reporter, go find me one, because he's gonna have me for his own personal scoop.
Ms. Parker, i'm no mere reporter, i'm the best correspondent in europe!
You write good stories?
The best.
All the news that's fit to print.
I don't want that kind.
You can print anything about me.
What i eat for breakfast, how i take a bath, anything that'll make mr. Michael anthony squirm.
Things about him, things about me, do you understand?
Parker, baby, you call the shots, and i'll pull the trigger.
Come on, reporter, i've got work to do, woman's work.
Waiter: Oh, madame, the bacon, the coffee, the- i don't want it, will you pay for it, please?
Sure.
Thank you.
Voila.
Merci, monsieur.
More backgammon?
No, thank you.
Casino? Checkers?
No casino, no checkers, thank you.
Knock, knock.
Who's there?
Machiavelli.
Machiavelli who?
Machiavelli good suit for $10.
Heh, heh, heh.
You get it?
Yes, i get it, barney.
You got a very pretty profile, you know.
It fits into your neck like it was made by a mechanic.
A lovely thought, barney.
You wouldn't like to neck, would you?
No thanks, do you mind?
Oh, that's all right, i just thought... when do you send your first cable?
I sent it.
And anthony, when does he get fired?
In a day or two, right out on his ear.
Oh, i suppose he'll get a job with another newspaper.
Him?
He'll be blacklisted.
Through.
Wonderful.
Can he do anything else?
Nothing that won't land him in jail.
I suppose he'll get on relief.
He might for a few days, but that's all.
They're fussy about who gets relief.
I hope he gets kicked off the bread line, too.
It's kind of strange to think of him being down and out.
Always so sure of himself, anthony was.
Mmmm.
That's the way it starts around new york.
I've seen hundreds of them.
First they borrow a 10-spot, then a buck, then 25 cents for donuts and coffee.
And then it's a shirt.
And they tell you they got a swell job doing publicity and you stumble over them one night in the park, wrapped up in an old sunday edition to keep the cold out.
Oh, stop it, barney.
Poor michael.
Woman, thy name is screwball.
Yeah, who is it?
Come on in.
Lunch is ready.
Barney: Hey!
What's the idea?
Your hands down, please.
I want that map, ms. Parker.
What are you talking about?
What map?
It was not in the plane, i want it quickly, ms. Parker.
What's he talking about?
I haven't got it.
Hilda, search her.
You put that gun down and try it.
I must insist upon an unfair advantage.
Step outside.
Well?
You'd better go, barney.
Everything off now, ms. Parker, quick.
Smile, please, we are friends, you and i.
I said smile.
Step along.
Wait, mr. Pells.
Do you play bridge?
Yeah, well, uh, just fair, who'd we get for a fourth?
Hey, hey, what's the idea!
Then you'll understand what i mean by sloughed.
You are about to be sloughed.
Jump!
You think i'm crazy?
Jump at once!
Hey, now wait, now listen, maybe the next stop we'll- ahhhh!
Yes?
She claims anthony has it.
Where is he?
She claims she doesn't know.
Give her back her things.
We'll follow her.
She'll lead us to him.
"I hereby resign.
Will probably become a gypsy."
He's become a gypsy.
We deserve better treatment than that, mr. Berger.
Deserve?
We deserve the pulitzer prize!
50,000 letters in this contest already.
This is more than human flesh could endure.
Why don't you get some sleep, chief?
Sleep?
Anthony fiddles while berger burns?
Woman: Mr. Berger!
Mr. Berger!
The dispatch has got sally parker.
I give up.
A lot of unwholesome racketeers have crept into this business.
It's no place for an honest man.
Pack my things, miss fowler.
Don't give me any farewell dinner, just let me fade out quietly.
Wait a minute.
Take a cable to michael anthony!
Get sally parker back!
She is with barney pells.
You still work for us!
Be a gypsy on your own time!
That's very appropriate, zodders, very appropriate.
Ah-ha! Judas!
That's a very fancy disguise, mr. Pells.
You're as transparent as a seer.
Gosh, i'm glad i found you.
We gotta talk.
Yeah, no sir.
I'm weak as a can, i lost about a gallon of blood, the doctor says.
And a bottle of burgundy, your best.
Bottle of burgundy?
Yes, sir.
Listen mike, parker's in danger.
What?
What did you say?
Where?
We were on the train to nice, see.
The baron busted in with a pistol.
He wants a map or something from parker.
What's it all about, and what are we gonna do?
She still with him?
As far as i know.
He sloughed me off the train, and here i am.
Nice, eh?
We gotta get going.
As soon as i get a little red blood in my veins.
Look, i gotta make a phone call to a friend of mine down there whom i can trust.
He'll look after sally until we get there.
Oh, say, look, i'm broke.
Have you got any dough?
Well, about 200 francs, why?
Give it to me.
Well, how are we gonna settle up here?
Well, my credit's good here, and i've gotta have dough to make that phone call.
Now listen, mike, by all that's holy, if you pull anything on me- wait a minute, kid.
You said she was in danger, didn't you?
I know, but- ok, mike.
B- but monsieur, i-i- shut up.
I think you ought to know the man at my table is the biggest deadbeat in europe.
He goes all over the continent catching dinners and drinks.
He's a mental case.
He hasn't a cent.
I ducked out, but i'm tipping you off.
But thank you, monsieur anthony.
Yeah, i'd throw a scare into him if i were you.
Keep him guessing for a while.
But i will, monsieur.
Here, here, this'll pay for mine.
Thank you, thank you, monsieur anthony.
I'll take care of it.
You are enjoying the dinner, monsieur?
Yeah, it's fine.
The steak is satisfactory?
Great, i may even have another one with more onions.
More onions.
Perhaps some mushrooms, too.
Mmmm... good idea.
And another bottle of wine.
You know it makes blood.
More wine?
Makes blood.
And how are you going to pay for all this?
Well, uh, mr. Anthony will be right back.
He just went to make a phone call.
Mr. Anthony told me what you are.
The deadest beat in europe.
A case which is mental.
Do you know how you are going to pay for this?
* gone, like the wind you are gone *
* just a dream lingers on *
* for my loved one is gone *
* gone, like the roses of june *
* like a beautiful tune *
* that has ended too soon *
* it seems a moment ago we met, if you forget *
* one fleeting moment of love that brings only regret *
* because you're gone * madame's pate is not right?
I don't wish it, thank you.
Thank you very much.
* for my loved one is gone * who is it?
Would you like to buy a pencil from an ex-newspaper man?
I just heard you were in trouble, and i thought that, well, i thought that maybe- oh darling, don't think.
Just hold me nice and close.
Now before we go into anything else, i just want you to know that i've quit
that glass bottom boat they call the chronicle.
You've quit?
Oh no, how could you?
But you said- oh, never listen to what i say, i learned that a long time ago.
Kiss me, please.
Did you hear anything?
Not a thing.
Nice work.
Must be the plumber.
It might be funnier than that.
It might be barney.
The human bloodhound?
Let me bid him welcome.
Mr. And mrs. Frankenstein.
They've been following me every minute.
They probably knew you were here.
They're really after you.
No, no, no. They're really after that map.
We've got to get it back to the london foreign office.
It's too important to be comfortable.
But how?
An anthony always goes out the way he comes in.
Come on.
Wait a minute.
I have time to fix up, haven't i?
We look disgraceful.
All right, i'll get the tickets and meet you over there.
All right.
Michael, i hope we live to be very, very old.
Perfect.
You know what to do?
Of course.
Parker!
Ms. Sally parker!
And what makes you think this lady is ms. Parker?
Because she is, i tell you!
She had the room reserved under perkins.
The name is perkins.
No, my friend!
The name is parker!
Can we stop all this and do a little police work?
She's either in a jam or she's with a burglar named anthony.
Burglar, you say?
What was stolen?
Listen, stop playing guggenheim, will you?
And get out the bloodhounds!
Ah, guggenheim.
Mr. Pells, these are necessary police details.
We must not leave a stone unturned.
How many people did you ever find under stones?
I want sally parker!
Somebody ought to be camping in that railroad station, and that's where i am right now!
Just got time to make it.
One on that channel train.
My mother just broke her hip in two places.
Where?
In two places- no, calais, as far as she goes.
Hurry, will you?
Hey!
Your change!
Well, here we are, all nice and safe- my compliments, baroness.
Just how long have i been under the impression that you were ms. Parker?
Only since rejoining you at the station.
I'll take that map now.
Where's ms. Parker?
In a very smart outfit i had to exchange for this.
That map, please.
Don't be silly, baroness.
Come in, wilhelm.
Let's do be silly, mr. Anthony, i want that map.
I'm very sorry.
I haven't got it.
If you remember in the hotel in london you were rude enough to surprise me during my salt rub.
If i don't get that map, i shall be forced to see you under similar circumstances... without the salt.
Shall we send willy here out for some?
Take off your coat.
All right, all right, just a minute.
It unbuttons.
It's not there.
Your trousers, please.
Uh, no, i give you my word it's not in my trousers.
Now let's talk this thing over, man to man.
Take them off.
Didn't you hear me yelling and pounding?
I've been locked in here for hours.
I was out of duty, madame.
But why did you put your clothes in the hamper?
It's just a sorority initiation.
Walk along this arcade, ms. Parker.
Your wife left with mr. Anthony, of course.
Yes, she's to have achieved her purpose by now.
She won't harm him, will she?
It would be necessary should he become difficult.
What are you going to do with me?
Soon as i receive word from my wife here, i shall consider that.
Would you care for some tea?
Please don't be surprised if i suddenly go into an accent.
Baron, after what i've been through, i wouldn't be surprised if you suddenly vanished in a puff of smoke.
Madame.
Monsieur.
I'm not very hungry, let's see.
Some smoked salmon with swedish bread.
And glass of turkish coffee.
And you, my dear?
Huh? Oh, some tea, black.
Now that everything's nice and cozy, may i have a cigarette?
Or do they have little capsules of poison in them?
Nothing as glamorous as that.
Straight virginia.
Most americans refuse.
I'm a rather unorthodox american, as you perhaps noticed.
And while we're on the subject, may i go on record as saying i dislike your wife very much?
And i'm glad she's out of the way for a while.
You are very frank.
And very lovely.
And very bored... with everything and everybody... up till now, baron.
What do you suggest?
Anything... anything that's different and exciting and glamorous.
Your life must be like that, baron.
Oh, you are very lovely.
I like to hear you say that.
And oh, you are so silly.
What you're attempting, my dear, has been tried by women from constantinople to new york.
I don't wish to appear unappreciative, but once or twice the temptation was even greater than it is now.
That's not fair.
I can see you're just not interested.
Baron: Now, my dear, we take a little trip to a- this is the lady here.
This is ms. Sally parker?
Yes, watch this man.
Ms. Parker, allow me to introduce- yes, i know, we'll go into that later.
But this man- i am baron spandermann.
Ah, yes, i recognize you, baron.
I'm an air enthusiast myself- baron nothing, he's a spy i tell you.
My dear ms. Parker- a spy!
Arrest him!
That accent is just a disguise.
Well, do something, will you?
My dear, lieutenant, ms. Parker is a little embarrassed.
I was trying to find her reasons for stealing my plane.
Will you please understand what i'm saying?
Quiet, ms. Parker.
This can all be settled in my office.
I must take you in custody as it is.
Baron, you'll come along and prefer charges.
Not pleasant, but i feel i should.
Oh, you poor dimwits, won't you believe me?
I'm sorry, ms. Parker, in my office.
Please, in my office.
Take my car, lieutenant, it is more comfortable.
Ah, very kind.
If you're a policeman worthy of the name, you'll listen to me and- in my office, ms. Parker.
Of course you realize your trustees have offered £5,000 reward for your apprehension and return?
For the last time, let me warn you, this man is- no, no, no, baron.
The police station is to your right.
We're not going to the police station.
I'm so sorry.
Slipped my mind.
I should have told you about the baron.
Chalet, please.
Welcome back, madame.
Follow that cab, please.
Yes, sir.
Come on.
We have a guest, rudolph.
I hope you enjoy our hospitality.
Go inside, please.
A very fanciful disguise, mr. Anthony.
You weren't hiding from me by any chance, were you?
Oh, all tied up good and tight, huh?
How about down here, eh?
Yeah, don't try to reason with me, anthony.
I'm a deadbeat.
A mental case.
Ow!
I don't react normally at all.
Don't look away.
So, little parker's finally getting her revenge on you, is she?
You would trifle with an unprotected maiden's heart, would you?
Even a hummingbird will turn and become a vicious monster if given sufficient provocation, mr. Anthony.
Don't wave your elbows like the black widow spider you are, my friend, because little parker and i are just about to fly away to a cable office,
mr. New york chronicles expert.
And then the dispatch readers will learn how barney pells turns the tables on a rat that leaves people rotting in restaurants.
All right, start lying to me.
For the love of mike, will you shut up?
That's not sally in there.
That's the baroness in sally's clothes.
You know who i am?
I'm the baron.
All right, just sit there and crack wise with your head in the noose.
If you won't help me, you'd better get out of here.
I'm the baron.
I just ate the baroness.
You're really a very low fella.
You gotta believe me this once, barney.
This is one time- this in no time.
Baroness, in other room:
Rudolph, rudolph.
Rudolph: Yes, hilda?
Baroness: And sounds from our nosy guest?
None. I may have strangled him.
I was in quite a hurry.
Baroness:
How careless of you, rudolph.
Yeah, well don't sit there gaping like a pelican, get me out of this.
Why, dive it all in the water.
How did things turn out this way?
Don't talk, untie.
Well, honest, mike, i had no idea.
Neither did i.
Do you think i came along for the ride?
What are we gonna do?
We gotta corral this outfit, that's what.
They've got a map that the foreign office wants back.
It's gotta have it back.
If it doesn't get it, it means a lot of trouble for a lot of people what a story!
Yeah, and if we leave, we're gonna write it, too.
Hey, wait a minute, i got it.
Here, you sit here.
Wait a minute, what's the idea?
You're going to be me.
Oh no you don't, my friend!
You've maneuvered me into things for the last time.
Wait a minute, barney, wait a minute.
This is different.
If we're going to save our hides and sally's and everybody's, we've got to do this.
I know the layout here.
Well, you can show it to me.
If it's as much an emergency as you say it is, you're gonna need my brain as well as your muscle.
And anyway, i can run just as fast as you can.
Nobody's going to run.
We're gonna walk out of here or not at all.
Well, what do i do if they come in?
Just keep quiet and i'll be covering you all the time.
Where will you be?
I'll be around, and if they get rough, i'll be in there for both of us.
Now listen, mike, if we get out of this, it's gonna be the biggest story since august, 1914.
You gotta stick by me this time.
I want you to know you're persuading me, but you haven't convinced me.
Barney, don't lose your perspective, old boy.
This is beyond any petty little gags we may have pulled on each other.
This is serious, kid.
Why, you're risking your life for me.
Oh, shucks, that's nothing.
How do you think i could double cross you now with everything that's at stake.
Why, this is the biggest thing that ever happened.
Richard harding davis never pulled a trick like this.
Greeley, dana, luther, burbank- well, the greatest of them never found this many pearls.
We'll split a byline on this, kid.
We'll go down in the archives of journalism in lace pants and gold hats.
Why, i'll never forget this as long as i live.
I wonder if i will.
You're all right, barney, old kid.
Oh, well, you must be on the level this time.
Nobody could be low enough and live to- well, it just doesn't happen, that's all.
No, you bet it doesn't, barney, old boy.
Here comes the baron.
He's got his mob with him.
Hey, this is serious, baby.
What's the matter?
Too tight?
No, i changed my mind!
I changed my mind!
Yeah, yeah, atta baby.
Fight!
Where's michael?
What have you done with him?
You'll join him in a minute.
My butler will take your things.
You'll be here quite some time.
Otto, the plane's ready.
Go upstairs, change, and get your things.
This affair's taken us a week, and we should've been a day.
I agree with you.
This way, please.
Oh, michael, darling, i'm here, it's sally!
Her first.
Paul, these two together.
Did they hurt you, darling?
Can't you talk?
Ouch!
Why, you poor excuse for a man.
I'll spend every cent i've ever had to find you.
I'll hire every g- man in america to trail you to vladivostok and back again.
You sneaking contemptible- owwwww!
Stop it!
I'm trying very hard to control myself, ms. Parker.
When you're discovered, we'd rest much easier if you're all discovered... quite dead.
I know, michael.
If you were free, she wouldn't talk that way.
Even if she does kill us, we'll be together, won't we, darling?
We've got them all, hilda?
Yes, you and paul leave in the car immediately.
We'll meet at the village 5 at the house with number 12.
Night after tomorrow.
Good luck to you both.
Good luck, hilda. Good-bye.
Whatever happens, we're not afraid, are we, darling?
I love you, michael, i- look out, michael, it looks as though she's going to fire any minute.
Oh, darling, please be careful, please!
It might be worth mentioning if i hear any cries or freaks before we're in the air, i'll start shooting through that door.
It's hard to say who i might hit.
Good-bye, paul!
Rudolph!
Paul and rudolph:
Good-bye! Good luck!
Hilda, i cannot find a towel, i'm all wet.
Hand me a towel, hilda, i'm all- ahhhh!
In my office, baron!
Here it is.
And that gives me an idea.
Is that comfortable, baroness?
Don't worry about her.
Truss her her up like a christmas duck.
Boy, if we only had some photographers, what a story!
What a tale!
We'll get a year's salary bonus on this, mike, my boy.
Come on, hurry up, get me out of this.
We gotta get to a cable office.
Yeah, yeah, i'm filing about 4,000 words for a flash bulletin.
What do you want me to cable to the dispatch?
Huh?
Gosh, uncle, i didn't realize that you were laid up this way.
Now wait a min- heh, heh, you're still the same old mike, huh?
This is no time for kidding!
When do you plan on getting out?
Is there anything that i can get to make you comfortable?
Uh, fruit, or flowers, or maybe you'd like a private room.
I'll speak to the house physician on the way out.
We'll split a byline on this, huh?
Yeah? Lace hats and gold pants, huh?
Sally, we better go, uncle's has too many visitors.
This is bigger than either of us, barney, old pal!
You risked your life for me, barney, old pal!
Here, here, now.
You can see the children playing in the garden.
Dana? Greeley?
They'll come back and haunt that dank, rotting cave you live in!
Good-bye, barney, old pal.
Sally!
Sally, stop him!
I'm sorry, i haven't time, barney, i have to write the woman's angle.
Then that goes for you, too, parker!
I hereby put the pell's curse on the two of you!
To the seventh son of the seventh son!
Maybe it's love, and maybe i'm just getting soft in the arteries, but suddenly, after all these years, i feel sorry for barney.
Do you think that i- i think you want to go back, and i think you're very nice.
Dunim wyler cable office.
Hello? Hello?
Hello?
Dunim wyler cable office.
Oh, oh, this is the cable office?
Well, this is barnabas w. Pells.
Now, send this collect.

Exclusive the new york dispatch.
By barnabas w. Pells.
Now get that name right.
B for black, a for- a, for ain't you ashamed of yourself?
No, mike! No!
Change that, change that byline.
Make it barnabas w. Pells and michael anthony.
I was gonna do it all the time, mike, old pal.
Yeah, sure you were, barney, old pal.
M, for maniac.
I, for i love you, darling.
And c, for crackpot.
And h, for how soon are we gonna get married?
H, for how soon are we gonna get ma- no, i'm not drunk!
A, for anytime you say.
Oh, shut up.
She isn't coming yet, Toto.
Did she hurt you?
She tried to, didn't she?
Come on. We'll go tell Uncle Henry and Auntie Em. Come on, Toto.
Aunt Em! Aunt Em!
Just listen to what Miss Gulch did to Toto...
Dorothy, please. We're counting.
- But she hit him...
- Don't bother us now, honey.
The incubator's gone bad and we're likely to lose a lot of our chicks.
Oh, that poor little thing.
But Miss Gulch hit Toto with a rake...
...because she says he chases her nasty old cat every day!
- Seventy. Dorothy, please!
But he doesn't do it every day!
Just once or twice a week.
He can't catch her old cat anyway.
- And now she says she's gonna...
- Dorothy. Dorothy, we're busy.
Oh, all right.
How's she coming?
Take it easy.
Ow!
You got my finger!
Get your finger out of the way.
There you are.
Right on my finger!
Lucky it wasn't your head.
Zeke, what am I gonna do about
Miss Gulch? Just because Toto...
Listen, honey,
I got them hogs to get in.
Dorothy, you ain't using your head.
You'd think you didn't have any brains.
- I have so got brains.
- Well, why don't you use them?
Don't go by Miss Gulch's place.
Then Toto won't get in her garden, and you won't get in no trouble, see?
Oh, Hunk, you just won't listen, that's all.
Well, your head ain't made of straw, you know.
Say, get in there before I make a dime bank out of you.
Listen, kid...
...are you gonna let that old Gulch heifer try and buffalo you?
She ain't nothing to be afraid of.
Have a little courage.
I'm not afraid of her.
Next time she squawks, walk up to her and spit in her eye.
- That's what I'd do.
- Oh! Oh!
Oh! Zeke!
Help! Help me, Zeke!
Get me out of here!
Help!
Oh! Oh!
Are you all right, Dorothy?
- Yes, I'm all right.
I fell in, and Zeke...
Why, Zeke, you're just as scared as I am.
You gonna let a little old pig make a coward out of you?
Look at you...
What's all this jabber-wapping when there's work to be done?
I know three farm hands that'll be out of a job.
Dorothy was...
I saw you tinkering with that contraption.
- You and Hunk get back to that wagon.
All right.
But someday they'll erect a statue to me...
Well, don't start posing for it now.
Can't work on an empty stomach.
Have some crullers.
Gosh, Mrs. Gale.
Just fried.
You see, Dorothy toppled into the...
It's no place for Dorothy around a pigsty!
Feed those hogs before they worry themselves into anemia!
- Yes.
- Auntie Em...
...you know what Miss Gulch said she was going to do to Toto?
- She said she'd...
Stop imagining things.
You always get in a fret over nothing.
You just help us out today...
...and find yourself a place where you won't get into any trouble.
Someplace where there isn't any trouble.
Do you suppose there is such a place, Toto?
There must be.
It's not a place you can get to by a boat or a train.
It's far, far away.
Behind the moon...
...beyond the rain...
Somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
There's a land that I heard of
Once in a lullaby
Somewhere over the rainbow
Skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream
Really do come true
Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds
Are far behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
Away above the chimney tops
That's where you'll...
...find me
Somewhere over the rainbow
Bluebirds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then...
...oh, why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly
Beyond the rainbow
Why, oh, why...
...can't I?
Mr. Gale.
Howdy, Miss Gulch.
I want to see you and your wife about Dorothy.
- What has Dorothy done?
- What's she done?
I'm all but lame from the bite on my leg!
- You mean, she bit you?
- No, her dog!
Oh, she bit her dog, eh?
No.
That dog's a menace. I'm taking him to make sure he's destroyed.
Destroyed! Toto?
Oh, you can't! You mustn't!
Auntie Em! Uncle Henry!
You won't let her, will you?
Of course we won't.
Uh, will we, Em?
Please, Aunt Em!
Toto didn't know he was doing anything wrong.
I'm the one that ought to be punished.
Send me to bed without supper.
Hand over that dog or I'll bring a suit that'll take your farm!
The law protects folks against dogs that bite!
How about if she keeps him tied up?
He's gentle.
- With gentle people, that is.
- That's for the sheriff to decide.
This order allows me to take him.
Unless you wanna go against the law.
Hm. Yes.
We can't go against the law.
I'm afraid poor Toto has to go.
- Now you're seeing reason.
- No.
Here's what I'm taking him in, so he can't attack me again.
No, No! I won't let you take him!
- You go away or I'll bite you myself!
Dorothy!
You wicked old witch! Uncle Henry,
Auntie Em, don't let her take Toto.
I've got an order!
- Let me have him!
- Please stop!
Put him in the basket, Henry.
- The idea!
- Don't, Uncle Henry.
Oh, Toto!
Almira Gulch, just because you own half the county...
...doesn't mean you can run the rest of us!
For 23 years I've been dying to tell you what I thought of you!
And now...
Well, being a Christian woman,
I can't say it!
Toto, darling!
Oh, I got you back!
You came back!
I'm so glad!
They'll be coming back for you in a minute.
We've got to get away!
We've got to run away!
Well, well, well! Houseguests, eh?
And who might you be?
No, no. Now, don't tell me.
Let's see. You're...
You're traveling in disguise.
No, that's not right. You're...
You're going on a visit.
No, I'm wrong. Let's see what we...
You're... You're running away.
How did you guess?
Professor Marvel never guesses, he knows.
Now, why are you running away?
No, no. Now, don't tell me.
They... They don't understand you at home. They don't appreciate you.
You want to see other lands.
Big cities, big mountains, big oceans.
Why, it's just like you could read what was inside of me.
Toto, that's not polite!
We haven't been asked yet.
Oh, he's perfectly welcome.
As one dog to another, huh?
Now, let's see, where were we?
Why can't we go with you and see all the crowned heads of Europe?
Do you know any?
Oh, you mean the thing. Yes.
Well, uh, I never do anything without consulting my crystal first.
Let's go inside here. We'll...
Just come along. I'll show you.
That's right. Here.
Sit right down here. That's it.
This is the same genuine, magic, authentic crystal...
...used by the priests of Isis and
Osiris in the days of the Pharaohs...
...in which Cleopatra saw the approach of Julius Caesar and Marc Anthony.
And so on, and so on. Now...
...you'd better close your eyes, my child, for a moment...
...in order to be better in tuned with the Infinite.
We can't do these things without reaching out into the Infinite.
Yes, that's all right.
Now you can open them.
We'll gaze into the crystal.
Ah.
What's this I see?
A house with a picket fence...
...and a barn with a weathervane...
...of a running horse.
- That's our farm!
- Yes.
Yes. There's a woman.
She's wearing a polka-dot dress.
Her face is careworn.
That's Aunt Em.
Yes. Her name is Emily.
That's right. What's she doing?
Well, I can't quite see.
Why, she's crying.
Someone has hurt her.
Someone has just about broken her heart.
Me?
Well, it's... It's someone she loves very much.
Someone she's been very kind to.
Someone she's taken care of in sickness.
I had the measles once, and she stayed right by me every minute.
Uh-huh.
What's she doing now?
Yes, she's... What's this?
Why, she's putting her hand on her heart!
- She's dropping down on the bed.
- Oh, no, no!
Well, that's all.
The crystal's gone dark.
You don't suppose she could really be sick, do you?
- Oh, I've gotta go home right away.
- I thought you were going with me.
No, I have to get to her right away!
Come on, Toto! Come on!
Goodbye, Professor Marvel.
And thanks a lot!
Better get under cover, Sylvester.
A storm's blowing up.
A whopper, to speak in the vernacular of the peasantry.
Poor little kid.
I hope she gets home all right.
Get them horses loose!
Where's Hickory? Hickory?
Doggone it!
It's a twister! It's a twister!
Dorothy!
Everybody in the storm cellar!
Henry, I can't find Dorothy!
She's out in the storm!
We can't look for her now.
Come on, get in the cellar!
Hurry up!
Auntie Em!
Auntie Em?
Auntie Em!
Auntie Em! Uncle Henry!
Auntie Em!
We must be up inside the cyclone!
Oh! Miss Gulch!
Oh!
Toto...
...I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.
We must be over the rainbow!
Now I know we're not in Kansas.
Are you a good witch or a bad witch?
Who, me?
Why, I'm not a witch at all.
- I'm Dorothy Gale, from Kansas.
- Oh.
Well, is that the witch?
Who, Toto? Toto's my dog.
I'm a little muddled. The Munchkins called me because a new witch...
...just dropped a house on the Wicked Witch of the East.
And there's the house, and here you are...
...and that's all that's left of the Wicked Witch of the East.
What the Munchkins want to know is, are you a good witch or a bad witch?
But I've already told you,
I'm not a witch at all.
Witches are old and ugly.
What was that?
The Munchkins. They're laughing because I am a witch.
I'm Glinda, the Witch of the North.
You are?
Oh, I beg your pardon!
But I've never heard of a beautiful witch before.
Only bad witches are ugly.
The Munchkins are happy because you freed them...
...from the Wicked Witch of the East.
- But if you please, what are Munchkins?
The little people who live here.
It's Munchkinland...
...and you are their national heroine, my dear.
It's all right.
You may all come out and thank her.
Come out, come out
Wherever you are
And meet the young lady
Who fell from a star
She fell from the sky
She fell very far
And Kansas, she says
Is the name of the star
Kansas, she says
Is the name of the star
She brings you good news
Or haven't you heard?
When she fell out of Kansas
A miracle occurred
It really was no miracle
What happened was just this
The wind began to switch
The house to pitch
And suddenly the hinges
Started to unhitch
Just then the Witch
To satisfy an itch
Went flying on her broomstick
Thumbing for a hitch
And oh, what happened then was rich
The house began to pitch
The kitchen took a slitch
It landed on the Wicked Witch
In the middle of a ditch
Which was not a healthy situation
For the Wicked Witch
The house began to pitch
The kitchen took a slitch
It landed on the Wicked Witch
In the middle of a ditch
Which was not a healthy situation
For the Wicked Witch
Who began to twitch
And was reduced to just a stitch
Of what was once the Wicked Witch
We thank you very sweetly
For doing it so neatly
You've killed her so completely
That we thank you very sweetly
Let the joyous news be spread!
The Wicked Old Witch at last is dead!
Ding-Dong! The Witch is dead
Which old witch? The Wicked Witch
Ding-Dong! The Wicked Witch is dead
Wake up, you sleepyhead
Rub your eyes, get out of bed
Wake up, the Wicked Witch is dead
She's gone where the goblins go
Below, below, below
Yo-ho! Let's open up and sing
And ring the bells out
Ding-Dong! The merry-o
Sing it high, sing it low
Let them know
The Wicked Witch is dead
As mayor of the Munchkin City
In the county of the Land of Oz
I welcome you most regally
But we've got to verify it legally
- To see
- To see?
- If she
- If she?
Is morally, ethically
- Spiritually, physically
- Positively, absolutely
Undeniably and reliably dead
As coroner I must aver
I thoroughly examined her
And she's not only merely dead
She's really most sincerely dead
Then this is a Day of Independence...
...for all the Munchkins and their descendants.
If any!
Yes, let the joyous news be spread.
The Wicked Old Witch at last is dead!
Ding-Dong! The Witch is dead
Which old witch? The Wicked Witch
Ding-Dong! The Wicked Witch is dead
Wake up, you sleepyhead
Rub your eyes, get out of bed
Wake up
The Wicked Witch is dead
She's gone where the goblins go
Below, below, below
Yo-ho! Let's open up and sing
And ring the bells out
Ding-Dong! The merry-o
Sing it high, sing it low
Let them know the Wicked Witch is dead
We represent the Lullaby League

From now on you'll be history
- You'll be his...
- You'll be history
And we will glorify your name
- You will be a bust
- Be a bust
- Be a bust

Tra-la-la-la-la-la

Tra-la-la-la-la
La...
I thought you said she was dead.
That was her sister, the Wicked Witch of the East.
This is the Wicked Witch of the West.
She's worse than the other one was.
Who killed my sister?
Who killed the Witch of the East?
Was it you?
No. No, it was an accident.
I didn't mean to kill anybody.
Well, my little pretty,
I can cause accidents too!
- Aren't you forgetting the ruby slippers?
- The slippers. Yes!
The slippers!
They're gone!
The ruby slippers!
What have you done with them?
Give them back to me or I'll...
It's too late! There they are, and there they'll stay!
Give me back my slippers!
Only I know how to use them.
They're of no use to you.
Give them back to me. Give them back!
Keep tight inside of them.
Their magic must be powerful...
...or she wouldn't want them so badly.
Stay out of this, Glinda, or I'll fix you as well!
Oh, rubbish!
You have no power here.
Begone, before somebody drops a house on you too.
Very well. I'll bide my time.
And as for you, it's true I can't attend to you here and now as I'd like.
But just try to stay out of my way!
Just try!
I'll get you, my pretty...
...and your little dog too!
It's all right. You can get up.
She's gone!
It's all right. You can all get up.
Oh! What a smell of sulfur!
I'm afraid you've made an enemy of the Wicked Witch.
The sooner you get out of Oz altogether, the safer you'll sleep, my dear.
Oh, I'd give anything to get out of Oz altogether.
But which is the way back to Kansas?
I can't go the way I came.
No, that's true.
The only person who might know...
...would be the great and wonderful
Wizard of Oz himself.
The Wizard of Oz?
Is he good or is he wicked?
Oh, very good, but very mysterious.
He lives in the Emerald City, a long journey from here.
Did you bring your broomstick with you?
- No, I'm afraid I didn't.
- Well, then, you'll have to walk.
The Munchkins will see you safely to the border of Munchkinland.
And remember, never let those ruby slippers off your feet for a moment...
...or you will be at the mercy of the Wicked Witch of the West.
But how do I start for Emerald City?
It's always best to start at the beginning.
And all you do is follow the Yellow Brick Road.
- But what happens if I...
- Just follow the Yellow Brick Road.
Goodbye!
My!
People come and go so quickly here!
Follow the Yellow Brick Road
Follow the Yellow Brick Road?
Follow the Yellow Brick Road
Follow the Yellow Brick Road
Follow the Yellow Brick Road
Follow, follow, follow, follow
Follow the Yellow Brick Road
Follow the Yellow Brick
Follow the Yellow Brick Road
You're off to see the Wizard
The wonderful Wizard of Oz
You'll find he is a whiz of a wiz
If ever a wiz there was
If ever, oh ever a wiz there was
The Wizard of Oz is one because
Because, because, because
Because, because
Because of the wonderful things he does
You're off to see the Wizard
The wonderful Wizard of Oz
Follow the Yellow Brick Road?
Follow the Yellow...?
Now which way do we go?
Pardon me!
That way is a very nice way.
Who said that?
Don't be silly, Toto.
- Scarecrows don't talk.
- It's pleasant down that way too.
That's funny.
Wasn't he pointing the other way?
Of course, people do go both ways.
Why, you did say something, didn't you?
Are you doing that on purpose, or can't you make up your mind?
That's the trouble.
I can't make up my mind.
I haven't got a brain.
Only straw.
How can you talk if you haven't got a brain?
I don't know.
But some people without brains do a lot of talking, don't they?
Yes, I guess you're right.
Well, we haven't really met properly, have we?
Why, no.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
- Very well, thank you.
- Oh, I'm not feeling at all well.
It's very tedious being stuck up here all day long with a pole up your back.
Oh, dear. That must be terribly uncomfortable. Can't you get down?
Down? No, you see, I'm...
Well, I'm...
Oh, well, here. Let me help you.
Oh, that's very kind of you.
Very kind.
Oh, dear. I don't see...
Of course, I'm not bright about doing things...
...but if you'll just bend the nail down, maybe I'll slip off and...
Oh, yes!
Whoops!
- There goes some of me again!
- Does it hurt you?
Oh, no. I just keep picking it up and putting it back in again.
My! It's good to be free!
Did I scare you?
No, no. I just thought you hurt yourself.
- But I didn't scare you?
- No, of course not.
I didn't think so.
Boo! Scat! Boo!
You see? I can't even scare a crow.
They come from miles around just to eat in my field and laugh in my face.
Oh, I'm a failure, because
I haven't got a brain!
Well, what would you do with a brain if you had one?
Do? Why, if I had a brain, I could...
I could while away the hours
Conferring with the flowers
Consulting with the rain
And my head I'd be scratchin'
While my thoughts were busy hatchin'
If I only had a brain
I'd unravel every riddle
For any individ'le
In trouble or in pain
With the thoughts you'd be thinkin'
You could be another Lincoln
If you only had a brain
Oh, I could tell you why
The ocean's near the shore
I could think of things
I never thunk before
And then I'd sit
And think some more
I would not be just a nothin'
My head all full of stuffin'
My heart all full of pain
I would dance and be merry
Life would be a ding-a-derry
If I only had a brain
Whoa!
Wonderful!
Why, if our scarecrow back in Kansas could do that...
...the crows would be scared to pieces!
- They would?
- Where's Kansas?
- That's where I live.
I wanna get back there so badly,
I'm going to Emerald City...
...to get the Wizard of Oz to help me.
- You're going to see a wizard?
- Mm-hmm.
Do you think if I went, this wizard would give me brains?
I couldn't say.
But even if he didn't, you'd be no worse off than you are now.
- Yes, that's true.
- But maybe you better not.
I've got a witch mad at me, and you might get into trouble.
Witch? I'm not afraid of a witch!
I'm not afraid of anything!
- Except a lighted match.
- I don't blame you for that.
But I'd face a whole box of them for the chance of getting some brains.
Look, I won't be any trouble, because I don't eat a thing.
And I won't try to manage things, because I can't think.
Won't you take me with you?
Why, of course I will!
Hooray! We're off to see a wizard!
You're not starting out very well.
Oh, I'll try! Really, I will.
- To Oz?
- To Oz!
We're off to see the Wizard
The wonderful Wizard of Oz
We hear he is a whiz of a wiz
If ever a wiz there was
If ever, oh ever a wiz there was
The Wizard of Oz is one because
Because, because, because
Because, because
Because of the wonderful things he does
We're off to see the wizard
The wonderful Wizard of Oz
Oh.
Apples!
Oh, look!
Oh!
Ouch!
What do you think you're doing?
We've been walking a long ways and I was hungry and...
Did you say something?
- She was hungry!
She was hungry!
How would like to have someone come along and pick something off of you?
Oh, dear! I keep forgetting
I'm not in Kansas.
Come along, Dorothy.
You don't want any of those apples.
Hmm.
Are you hinting my apples aren't what they ought to be?
Oh, no! It's just that she doesn't like little green worms.
Oh, you!
I'll show you how to get apples.
Oh! Oh!
Hooray! I guess that did it. Help yourself.
Why, it's a man!
A man made out of tin!
Yes!
Look!
Did you say something?
He said "oilcan. "
- Oil can what?
- Oilcan?
Oh, here it is.
Where do you want to be oiled first?
He said his mouth.
The other side.
Mm... Mm... Mm...
My goodness! I can talk again! Oh!
Oil my arms, please. Oil my elbows.
Here.
- Did that hurt?
- No, it feels wonderful.
I've held that axe up for ages.
Goodness!
How did you ever get like this?
Well, about a year ago...
...I was chopping that tree...
...when suddenly it began to rain.
And right in the middle of a chop,
I rusted solid.
And I've been that way ever since.
Well, you're perfect now.
My neck. My neck.
Perfect?
Bang on my chest if you think I'm perfect.
Go ahead, bang on it!
Beautiful! What an echo!
It's empty.
The tinsmith forgot to give me a heart.
- No heart?
- No heart?
No heart.
All hollow.
When a man's an empty kettle
He should be on his mettle
And yet I'm torn apart
Just because I'm presumin'
That I could be kind of human
If I only had a heart
I'd be tender, I'd be gentle
And awful sentimental
Regarding love and art
I'd be friends with the sparrows
And the boy who shoots the arrows
If I only had a heart
Picture me
A balcony
Above, a voice sings low
Wherefore art thou, Romeo?
I hear a beat
How sweet!
Just to register emotion
Jealousy, devotion
And really feel the part
I could stay young and chipper
And I'd lock it with a zipper
If I only had a heart
Oh! Oh, oh, oh, oh!
- Are you all right?
- I'm a little rusty yet.
Oh, dear!
That was wonderful!
You know, we were wondering why you couldn't come with us...
...to the Emerald City to ask the Wizard of Oz for a heart.
Suppose the Wizard wouldn't give me one when we got there.
Oh, but he will!
He must!
We've come such a long way already.
You call that long?
Why, you've just begun!
Helping the little lady along, are you, my fine gentlemen?
Well, stay away from her...
...or I'll stuff a mattress with you!
And you!
I'll use you for a beehive!
Here, scarecrow. Wanna play ball?
Fire! I'm burning! I'm burning!
I'm not afraid of her.
I'll see you get safely to the Wizard, whether I get a brain or not!
Stuff a mattress with me!
I'll see you reach the Wizard, whether I get a heart or not.
Beehive! Bah!
Let her try and make a beehive out of me.
Oh, you're the best friends anybody ever had.
And it's funny, but I feel as if
I've known you all the time.
- But I couldn't have, could I?
- I don't see how.
You weren't around when I was stuffed and sewn together, were you?
And I was standing over there rusting for the longest time.
Still, I wish I could remember.
But I guess it doesn't matter anyway.
We know each other now, don't we?
- That's right.
- We do.
- To Oz?
- To Oz!
We're off to see the Wizard
The wonderful Wizard of Oz
We hear he is a whiz of a wiz
If ever a wiz there was
If ever, oh ever a wiz there was
The Wizard of Oz is one because
Because, because, because
Because, because
Because of the wonderful things he does
We're off to see the Wizard
The wonderful Wizard of Oz
I don't like this forest.
It's dark and creepy.
Of course, I don't know, but I think it'll get darker before it gets lighter.
Do...
Do you suppose we'll meet any wild animals?
We might.
Animals that eat straw?
Some, but mostly lions and tigers and bears.
- Lions!
- And tigers?
And bears!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my!
Oh!
Put 'em up! Put 'em up!
Which one of you first?
I'll fight you both together, if you want.
I'll fight you with one paw tied behind my back!
I'll fight you standing on one foot!
I'll fight you with my eyes closed!
Oh, pulling an ax on me, eh?
Sneaking up on me, eh? Why...
- Here, here. Go away and let us alone.
- Oh, scared, huh?
Afraid, huh?
How long can you stay fresh in that can?
Come on, get up and fight, you shivering junkyard.
Put your hands up, you lopsided bag of hay!
That's getting personal, Lion.
Yes, get up and teach him a lesson.
What's wrong with you teaching him?
Well, I hardly know him.
Well, I'll get you anyway, peewee.
Shame on you!
What did you do that for?
I didn't bite him.
No, but you tried to.
It's bad enough picking on a straw man, but picking on poor little dogs...
Well, you didn't have to go and hit me, did you?
Is my nose bleeding?
Well, of course not.
My goodness, what a fuss you're making!
Well, naturally, when you go around picking on things weaker than you are...
You're nothing but a big coward!
You're right, I am a coward!
I haven't any courage at all.
I even scare myself!
Look at the circles under my eyes.
I haven't slept in weeks.
Why don't you try counting sheep?
That doesn't do any good.
I'm afraid of them.
Oh, that's too bad.
Don't you think the Wizard could help him too?
I don't see why not.
Come along with us.
We're on our way to see the Wizard.
To get him a heart.
- And him a brain.
- He could give you some courage.
Wouldn't you feel degraded to be seen in the company of a cowardly lion?
I would.
No, of course not.
Gee, that's awfully nice of you.
- My life has been simply unbearable.
- Oh.
Well, it's all right now.
The Wizard'll fix everything.
It's been in me so long.
I just gotta tell you how I feel.
Well, come on!
Yeah, it's sad,
Believe me, missy
When you're born to be a sissy
Without the vim and verve
But I could show my prowess
Be a lion, not a mouse
If I only had the nerve
I'm afraid there's no denyin'
I'm just a dandy lion
A fate I don't deserve
- I'd be brave as a blizzard
- I'd be gentle as a lizard
I'd be clever as a gizzard
If the Wizard is a wizard
Who will serve
Then I'm sure to get a brain
- A heart
- A home
The nerve!
Oh
We're off to see the Wizard
The wonderful Wizard of Oz
We hear he is a whiz of a wiz
If ever a wiz there was
If ever, oh ever a wiz there was
The Wizard of Oz is one because
Because, because, because
Because, because
Because of the wonderful things he does
We're off to see the Wizard
The wonderful Wizard of Oz
So you won't take warning, eh?
All the worse for you, then.
I'll take care of you now instead of later!
When I gain those ruby slippers...
...my power will be the greatest in Oz!
And now, my beauties...
...something with poison in it, I think.
With poison in it.
But attractive to the eye and soothing to the smell!
Poppies.
Poppies!
Poppies will put them to sleep.
Sleep...
Now they'll sleep.
There's Emerald City!
Oh, we're almost there!
At last! At last!
It's beautiful, isn't it?
Just like I knew it would be.
He really must be a wonderful wizard to live in a city like that.
Come on, what are we waiting for?
Nothing! Let's hurry!
Yes, let's run!
- Come on! Come on!
- Hurry! Hurry!
Oh, look!
Come on! Come on!
Look at the scenery. It's wonderful!
Emerald City!
Oh. What's happening?
What is it?
I can't run anymore.
- I'm so sleepy.
- Give us your hands and we'll pull you.
Oh, no, please.
I have to rest for just a minute.
Toto. Where's Toto?
You can't rest now.
We're nearly there.
Don't cry.
You'll rust yourself again!
Coming to think of it, forty winks wouldn't be bad.
- Don't you start it too!
- No!
We ought to carry Dorothy.
I don't think I could, but we could try.
- Let's.
- Yes.
- Now look at him. This is terrible!
- Here, Tin Man, help me.
Oh, this is terrible!
I can't budge her an inch.
This is a spell, this is!
It's the Wicked Witch! What'll we do?
Help! Help!
It's no use screaming at a time like this.
Nobody will hear you!
Help! Help!
Help!
It's snowing!
No, it isn't.
Yes, it is!
Maybe that'll help!
Oh, but it couldn't help!
It does help!
Dorothy, you're waking up!
Oh. Oh.
Unusual weather we're having, ain't it?
Look! He's rusted again.
- Oh, give me the oilcan, quick!
Here.
- He is rusted.
Here.
Here.
Quick! Oh! Oh!
Curses! Curses!
Somebody always helps that girl.
But shoes or no shoes,
I'm still great enough to conquer her.
And woe to those who try to stop me!
Come on, let's get out of here.
Look! Emerald City is closer and prettier than ever!
You're out of the woods
You're out of the dark
You're out of the night
Step into the sun
Step into the light
Keep straight ahead for
The most glorious place
On the face of the earth
Or the sky
Hold on to your breath
Hold on to your heart
Hold on to your hope
March up to the gate
And bid it open
To the Emerald City, as fast as lightning!
You're out of the woods
You're out of the dark
You're out of the night
Step into the sun
Step into the light
March up to the gate
And bid it...
...open
Open
Who rang that bell?
We did!
- Can't you read?
- Read what?
- The notice!
What notice?
- It's on the door!
As plain as the nose on my face!
Oh... Uh...
Oh! Tsk, tsk, tsk.
"Bell out of order. Please knock. "
Well! That's more like it!
Now, state your business.
We wanna see the Wizard.
The Wizard?
But nobody can see the great Oz.
Nobody's ever seen the great Oz!
Even I've never seen him!
Well, then, how do you know there is one?
Because he's...
Oh! You're wasting my time!
Oh, please. Please, sir.
I've got to see the Wizard.
- The Good Witch of the North sent me.
- Prove it!
She's wearing the ruby slippers that she gave her.
Oh! So she is!
Well, bust my buttons!
Why didn't you say that in the first place?
That's a horse of a different color!
Come on in!
Cabby! Cabby!
Just what you're looking for.
Take you any place in the city, we does.
- Would you take us to see the Wizard?
- The Wizard? The Wizard?
Yes, of course. But first I'll take you to a little place...
...where you can tidy up a bit.
- Oh, thank you so much!
We've been gone such a long time, and we feel so mess...
What kind of a horse is that?
I've never seen a horse like that before!
No, and never will again, I fancy.
There's only one of him, and he's it.
He's the horse of a different color you've heard tell about.
Ha-ha-ha! Ho-ho-ho!
And a couple of tra-la-las
That's how we laugh the day away
In the merry old land of Oz
Bzz, bzz, bzz!
Chirp, chirp, chirp!
And a couple of la-di-das
That's how the crickets crick all day
In the merry old land of Oz
We get up at twelve
And start to work at one
Take an hour for lunch
And then at two we're done
Jolly good fun!
Ha-ha-ha!
Ho-ho-ho!
And a couple of tra-la-las
That's how we laugh the day away
In the merry old land of Oz
Ha-ha-ha!
Ho-ho-ho!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
That's how we laugh the day away
With a
Ho-ho-ho!
Ha-ha-ha!
In the merry old land of Oz
Pat, pat here
Pat, pat there
And a couple of brand-new straws
That's how we keep you young and fair
In the merry old land of Oz
Rub, rub here
Rub, rub there
Whether you're tin or bronze
That's how we keep you in repair
In the merry old land of Oz
We can make a dimpled smile
Out of a frown
Can you even dye my eyes
To match my gown?
- Uh-huh
Jolly old town!
Clip, clip here
Clip, clip there
We give the roughest claws
That certain air of savoir-faire
In the merry old land of Oz
That's how we laugh the day away
In the merry old land of Oz
That's how we laugh the day away
With a ha-ha-ha
In the merry old land of Oz
Who's her? Who's her?
It's the witch!
She's followed us here!
"Surrender, Dorothy. "
Dorothy? Who's Dorothy?
- The Wizard will explain it!
- To the Wizard!
Dear! Whatever shall we do?
We better hurry if we're gonna see the Wizard!
Here! Here, here!
Everything is all right.
Stop that now, just...
It's all right!
Everything is all right!
The great and powerful Oz has got matters well in hand.
I hope.
So you can all go home!
There's nothing to worry about!
Get out of here. Now go on!
Go on home.
Go home.
We want to see the Wizard right away.
All four of us.
Orders are, nobody can see the great Oz! Not nobody, not nohow!
But, please! It's very important.
I got a permanent just for the occasion.
Not nobody, not nohow!
But she's Dorothy!
The witch's Dorothy?
Well, that makes a difference.
Just wait here.
I'll announce you at once.
Did you hear that?
He'll announce us at once.
- I've as good as got my brain.
- I can fairly hear my heart beating.
I'll be home for supper.
In another hour,
I'll be king of the forest.
Long live the king!
If I were king of the forest
Not queen
Not duke
Not prince
My regal robes of the forest
Would be satin
Not cotton
Not chintz
I'd command each thing
Be it fish or fowl
With a woof!
And a woof!
And a royal growl
As I'd click my heel
All the trees would kneel
And the mountains bow
And the bulls kowtow
And the sparrow would take wing
If I
If I were king
Each rabbit would show respect to me
The chipmunks genuflect to me
Though my tail would lash
I would show compash
For every underling
If I
If I were king
Just king
Monarch of all I survey
Monarch
Of all I survey
If you were king, you wouldn't be afraid of anything?
Not nobody, not nohow!
- Not even a rhinoceros?
- Imposserous!
- How about a hippopotamus?
- I'd trash him from top to "bottom-us. "
- Supposing you met an elephant?
- I'd wrap him up in "cello-phant"!
- What if it were a brontosaurus?
- I'd show him who's king of the forest!
How?
- How?
Courage!
What makes a king out of a slave?
Courage!
What makes the flag on the mast to wave? Courage!
What makes the elephant charge his tusk...
...in the misty mist or the dusky dusk?
What makes the muskrat guard his musk? Courage!
What makes the sphinx the Seventh Wonder? Courage!
What makes the dawn come up like thunder? Courage!
What makes the Hottentot so hot?
What puts the "ape" in apricot?
What have they got that I ain't got?
Courage!
- You can say that again.
Huh?
The Wizard says go away!
Go away?
Looks like we came a long way for nothing.
And I was so happy.
I thought I was on my way home.
Don't cry.
We're gonna get you to the Wizard.
We certainly are.
Auntie Em was so good to me...
...and I never appreciated it.
Running away and hurting her feelings.
Professor Marvel said she was sick.
She may be dying...
...and it's all my fault.
I'll never forgive myself.
Never, never, never.
Please don't cry anymore.
I'll get you into the Wizard somehow.
Come on.
I had an Aunt Em myself once.
Wait a minute, fellas.
I was just thinking, I really don't want to see the Wizard this much.
I better wait for you outside.
- What's the matter?
- He's just scared again.
Don't you know the Wizard will give you courage?
I'd be too scared to ask him for it.
Well, then, we'll ask him for you.
I'd sooner wait outside.
Why? Why?
Because I'm still scared!
- What happened?
- Somebody pulled my tail.
You did it yourself.
- Oh.
- Here.
Come on.
Come forward!
Tell me when it's over!
Look at that. Look at that!
I wanna go home!
I am Oz...
...the great and powerful!
Who are you?
If you please...
...I am Dorothy...
...the small and meek.
We've come to ask you...
- Silence!
- Oh!
Oh! Jiminy crickets!
The great and powerful Oz...
...knows why you have come.
Step forward...
...Tin Man!
You dare to come to me for a heart, do you?
You clinking, clanking, clattering...
...collection of caliginous junk!
Yes, sir.
Yes, Your Honor.
You see...
...a while back, we were walking down the Yellow Brick Road and...
Quiet!
And you, Scarecrow...
...have the effrontery to ask for a brain...
...you billowing bale of bovine fodder!
Yes, Your Honor.
I mean, Your Excellency.
I mean, Your Wizardry!
Enough!
And you, Lion!
Well?
You ought to be ashamed of yourself...
...frightening him like that when he came to you for help!
Silence, whippersnapper!
The beneficent Oz has every intention of granting your requests.
What's that? What'd he say?
Huh? What'd he say?
But first, you must prove yourselves worthy...
...by performing a very small task.
Bring me the broomstick of the Witch of the West.
But if we do that, we'll have to kill her to get it.
Bring me her broomstick...
...and I'll grant your requests.
Now go!
But what if she kills us first?
I said go!
"I'd turn back if I were you. "
I believe there's spooks around here.
That's ridiculous!
Spooks. That's silly.
Don't you believe in spooks?
No. Why, only... Oh!
Are you all right?
I do believe in spooks.
I do, I do, I do, I do.
I do believe in spooks.
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do!
You'll believe in more than that before I'm finished with you.
Take your army and bring me that girl and her dog.
Do what you like with the others, but I want her alive and unharmed.
They'll give you no trouble.
I promise you that.
I've sent a little insect on ahead to take the fight out of them.
Take special care of those slippers.
I want those most of all.
Now, fly! Fly!
Bring me that girl and her slippers!
Fly! Fly! Fly!
Help! Help!
Go away now!
Toto! Toto! Help!
Help! Help! Help!
What happened to you?
They tore my legs off and threw them over there!
Then they took my chest and threw it over there!
That's you all over.
They sure knocked the stuffings out of you.
Don't stand there. Put me together.
We've got to find Dorothy!
Now, let's see...
What a nice little dog.
And you, my dear.
What an unexpected pleasure.
It's so kind of you to visit me in my loneliness.
What are you gonna do with my dog?
Give him back to me!
All in good time, my little pretty.
- All in good time.
- Please give me back my dog.
Certainly, certainly...
...when you give me those slippers.
- But the Good Witch told me not to.
- Very well.
Throw that basket in the river and drown him.
No! Here. You can have your old slippers, but give me back Toto!
That's a good little girl.
I knew you'd see reason!
I'm sorry! I didn't do it.
Can I still have my dog?
No! Fool that I am,
I should have remembered...
...those slippers will never come off...
...as long as you're alive.
But that's not what's worrying me.
It's how to do it.
These things must be done delicately...
...or you hurt the spell.
Run, Toto, run!
Catch him, you fool!
Run, Toto, run!
Run, Toto, run!
He got away! He got away!
Which is more than you will!
Drat, you and your dog!
You've been more trouble to me than you're worth.
But it'll soon be over now!
Do you see that?
That's how much longer you've got to be alive.
And it isn't long, my pretty.
It isn't long!
I can't wait forever to get those shoes!
I'm frightened.
I'm frightened, Auntie Em!
I'm frightened.
Dorothy! Dorothy!
Where are you?
It's me. It's Auntie Em.
We're trying to find you.
Where are you?
I'm here in Oz, Auntie Em.
I'm locked up in the Witch's castle...
...and I'm trying to get home to you,
Auntie Em!
Oh, Auntie Em, don't go away!
I'm frightened!
Come back! Come back!
"Auntie Em, Auntie Em! Come back!"
I'll give you Auntie Em, my pretty!
Look! There's Toto.
Where'd he come from?
Why, don't you see?
He's come to take us to Dorothy.
Come on, fellas!
I hope my strength holds out.
I hope your tail holds out.
What's that? What's that?
That's the castle of the Wicked Witch.
- Dorothy's in that awful place?
- I hate to think of her in there.
- We've got to get her out.
- Don't cry now.
We haven't got the oilcan, and you've been squeaking enough as it is.
Who's them? Who's them?
- I've got a plan how to get in there.
- Fine. He's got a plan.
- And you're gonna lead us.
- Yeah.
- Me?
- Yes, you.
- I gotta get her out of there?
- That's right.
All right, I'll go in there for Dorothy.
Wicked Witch or no Wicked Witch...
...guards or no guards,
I'll tear them apart.
I may not come out alive, but I'm going in there.
- There's only one thing I want you to do.
- What's that?
Talk me out of it.
- No, you don't!
- Oh, no.
- Now, wait a minute.
Up!
Shh!
Shh! Shh!
Come on, I've got another idea.
Do you think it would be polite, dropping in like this?
- Where do we go now?
- Yeah.
There!
Wait! We better make sure.
Dorothy, are you in there?
It's us!
- Yes!
It's me! She's locked me in!
We gotta get her out! Open the door!
Oh, hurry! Please hurry!
The hourglass is almost empty!
Stand back!
Oh, Toto! Toto! Oh, Lion!
I knew you'd come!
I knew you would!
Hurry, we've got no time to lose!
Going so soon?
I wouldn't hear of it.
Why, my little party's just beginning.
Trapped. Trapped like mice... rats.
That's right.
Don't hurt them right away.
We'll let them think about it a little first.
Seize them! Seize them!
Stop them, you fools!
Seize them! Seize them!
There they go! Now we've got them!
Half of you go this way, half of you go that way.
Hurry! Hurry!
Where do we go now?
This way. Come on!
Back! Back!
Well!
Ring-around the rosie, a pocket full of spears!
Thought you'd be pretty foxy, didn't you?
The last to go will see the first three go before her.
And her mangy little dog too!
How about a little fire, Scarecrow?
Help! I'm burning! I'm burning!
It's burning! Help!
Don't throw that water!
You cursed brat!
Look what you've done!
I'm melting! Melting!
Oh, what a world! What a world!
Who would've thought a good little girl like you...
...could destroy my beautiful wickedness?
Look out! Look out!
I'm going.
She's dead. You've killed her.
I didn't mean to kill her.
Really, I didn't.
It's just that he was on fire.
Hail to Dorothy!
The Wicked Witch is dead!
Hail! Hail to Dorothy!
The Wicked Witch is dead!
The broom.
- May we have it?
- Please. And take it with you.
Oh, thank you so much!
Now we can go tell the Wizard the Wicked Witch is dead!
The Wicked Witch is dead!
Can I believe my eyes?
Why have you come back?
Please, sir. We've done what you told us.
We've brought you the broomstick of the Wicked Witch of the West.
We melted her.
Ah, you liquidated her, eh?
- Very resourceful.
- Yes, sir.
So we'd like you to keep your promise to us, if you please, sir.
Not so fast. Not so fast!
I'll have to give the matter a little thought.
Go away and come back tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
Oh, but I wanna go home now!
- You've had plenty of time already.
- Yeah.
Do not arouse the wrath of the great and powerful Oz!
I said come back tomorrow!
If you were really great and powerful, you'd keep your promises.
Do you presume to criticize the great Oz?
You ungrateful creatures!
Think yourselves lucky that I'm giving you audience tomorrow...
...instead of 20 years from now!
Oh!
The great Oz has spoken! Oh!
Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain.
The great and...
Oz has spoken.
Who are you?
I am the great and powerful
Wizard of Oz.
You are? I don't believe you.
I'm afraid it's true.
There's no other Wizard except me.
- You humbug!
- Yeah.
Yes, that's exactly so. I'm a humbug.
You're a very bad man!
Oh, no, my dear. I'm a very good man.
I'm just a very bad wizard.
What about the heart you promised Tin Man?
And the courage you promised
Cowardly Lion?
- And Scarecrow's brain?
- And Scarecrow's brain?
Why, anybody can have a brain.
That's a very mediocre commodity.
Every pusillanimous creature that crawls on the earth...
...or slinks through slimy seas has a brain.
Back where I come from, we have universities...
...seats of great learning, where men go to become great thinkers.
They think deep thoughts, and with no more brains than you have.
But they have one thing you haven't got. A diploma.
Therefore, by virtue of the authority vested in me...
...by the Universitatus Committeeatum
E Pluribus Unum...
...I hereby confer upon you...
...the honorary degree of Th. D.
- Th. D.?
That's Doctor of Thinkology.
The sum of the square roots of two sides of an isosceles triangle...
...is equal to the square root of the remaining side.
Oh, joy! Rapture!
I've got a brain!
- How can I thank you enough?
- Well, you can't.
As for you, my fine friend, you're a victim of disorganized thinking.
You are under the delusion that because you run away from danger...
...you have no courage.
You're confusing courage with wisdom.
Back where I come from, we have men who are called "heroes. "
Once a year, they take their fortitude out of mothballs...
...and parade it down the main street.
And they have no more courage than you have.
But they have one thing that you haven't got. A medal.
Therefore...
...for meritorious conduct, extraordinary valor...
...conspicuous bravery against wicked witches...
...I award you the Triple Cross.
You are now a member of the Legion of Courage.
Shucks, folks, I'm speechless.
As for you, my galvanized friend, you want a heart.
You don't know how lucky you are not to have one.
Hearts will never be practical until they can be made unbreakable.
But I still want one.
Back where I come from, there are men who do nothing all day but good deeds.
They are called phil...
Good-deed-doers. And their hearts are no bigger than yours.
But they have one thing you haven't got. A testimonial.
Therefore, in consideration of your kindness...
...I take pleasure at this time in presenting you...
...with a small token of our esteem and affection.
And remember, my sentimental friend...
...that a heart is not judged by how much you love...
...but by how much you are loved by others.
Ah.
Oh! It ticks!
Listen! Look, it ticks!
Read what my medal says. "Courage. "
Ain't it the truth!
Ain't it the truth!
Oh, they're all wonderful.
Hey, what about Dorothy?
Yes, how about Dorothy?
- Yeah. Dorothy next.
I don't think there's anything in that black bag for me.
You force me into a cataclysmic decision.
The only way to get Dorothy to Kansas is for me to take her myself.
Oh, will you? Could you? Oh!
But are you clever enough to manage it?
Child, you cut me to the quick!
I'm an old Kansas man myself...
...born and bred in the western wilderness...
...premier balloonist par excellence to the
Miracle Wonderland Carnival Company.
Until one day, while performing feats of stratospheric skill...
...never before attempted by civilized man...
...an unfortunate phenomena occurred.
The balloon failed to return to the fair.
- It did?
- Weren't you frightened?
You are talking to a man who has laughed in the face of death...
...sneered at doom and chuckled at catastrophe. I was petrified.
Suddenly the wind changed...
...and the balloon floated down into this noble city...
...where I was instantly acclaimed Oz, the first wizard deluxe!
Times being what they were,
I accepted the job...
...retaining my balloon against the advent of a quick getaway.
And in that balloon, dear Dorothy...
...you and I will return to the land of E Pluribus Unum.
My friends. I mean, my friends!
This is positively the finest exhibition ever to be shown...
...be that as it may.
I, your Wizard per ardua ad alta...
...am about to embark upon a hazardous...
...and technically unexplainable journey...
...into the outer stratosphere!
To confer, converse...
...and otherwise hobnob with my brother wizards.
And I hereby decree that until what time...
...if any, that I return...
...the Scarecrow, by virtue of his highly superior brains...
...shall rule in my stead...
...assisted by the Tin Man, by virtue of his magnificent heart...
...and the Lion, by virtue of his courage.
Obey them as you would me.
Thank you.
Oh, Toto! Come back! Toto!
Don't go without me.
I'll be right back.
Stop that dog!
This is a highly irregular procedure.
This is absolutely unprecedented!
- Ruined my exit!
Come back! Come back!
Don't go without me!
Please come back!
I can't come back!
I don't know how it works!
Goodbye, folks!
Goodbye!
Oh, now I'll never get home.
Stay with us then, Dorothy.
We all love you.
We don't want you to go.
That's very kind of you...
...but this could never be like Kansas.
Auntie Em must have stopped wondering what happened to me by now.
Oh, Scarecrow, what am I going to do?
Look!
Here's someone who can help you!
- Will you help me? Can you help me?
- You don't need help any longer.
You've always had the power to go back to Kansas.
- I have?
- Then why didn't you tell her before?
Because she wouldn't have believed me.
She had to learn it for herself.
What have you learned, Dorothy?
Well...
I think that it...
...that it wasn't enough just to want to see Uncle Henry and Auntie Em.
And it's that if I ever go looking for my heart's desire again...
...I won't look any further than my own back yard...
...because if it isn't there...
...I never really lost it to begin with.
Is that right?
That's all it is.
But that's so easy!
I should've thought of it for you.
- I should've felt it in my heart.
- She had to find it out for herself.
Now those magic slippers will take you home in two seconds.
- Toto too?
- Toto too.
- Now?
- Whenever you wish.
Oh, dear.
That's too wonderful to be true!
Oh, it's...
It's gonna be so hard to say goodbye.
I love you all too.
Goodbye, Tin Man.
Oh, don't cry.
You'll rust so dreadfully.
Here. Here's your oilcan.
- Goodbye.
- Now I know I've got a heart...
...because it's breaking.
Goodbye, Lion.
I know it isn't right...
...but I'm gonna miss the way you used to holler for help...
...before you found your courage.
I would never have found it if it hadn't been for you.
I think I'll miss you most of all.
- Are you ready now?
- Yes.
Say goodbye, Toto.
- Yes, I'm ready now.
- Then close your eyes...
...and tap your heels together three times...
...and think to yourself:
"There's no place like home.
There's no place like home. "
There's no place like home.
Wake up, honey.
- There's no place like home.
There's no place like home.
There's no...
Dorothy, dear. It's Aunt Em, darling.
Oh, Auntie Em, it's you!
- Yes, darling.
Hello there! Anybody home?
I dropped by because I heard the little girl got caught in the big...
- Well, she seems all right now.
- She got quite a bump on the head.
We kind of thought she was gonna leave us.
But I did leave you.
That's just the trouble.
And I tried to get back for days!
There, there, lie quiet now.
- You just had a bad dream.
- Sure.
Remember me...
...your old pal, Hunk?
And me, Hickory?
You couldn't forget my face, could you?
No. But it wasn't a dream.
It was a place.
And you and you and you...
...and you were there.
But you couldn't have been, could you?
We dream lots of silly things when we...
No, Aunt Em, this was a real, truly live place.
And I remember that some of it wasn't very nice...
...but most of it was beautiful.
But just the same, all I kept saying to everybody was, "I want to go home!"
And they sent me home.
Doesn't anybody believe me?
Of course we believe you, Dorothy.
But anyway, Toto, we're home!
Home! And this is my room...
...and you're all here.
And I'm not going to leave here ever, ever again...
...because I love you all.
And oh, Auntie Em...
...there's no place like home!
THE BLUE LIGHT
Good day Mister.
Greetings.
Can we stay here tonight?.
Tomorrow we would like to go to Monte Christallo.
Who is this person Junta?.
Junta?.
Ernst, come in.
Bring the book here, it is about Junta.
Horst, it is now the right time to read about the Blue Light on the mountain.
Did Junta really live?.
Have we arrived?.
Does this road lead to
Santa Maria?.
Hey Sir...
Is he mute or doesn't he understand German?.
Bye.... bye...
I am the hotel manager of Santa Maria.
Oh thank God... finally somebody who speaks German.
Did you come to pick me up?.
Yes.
What are these strange sculptures?.
These are the boys of the village who fell off the mountain.
That's my son.
You are not very joyful here.
It's a full moon, a bad day for Santa Maria.
What does that have to do with the moon?.
A curse on our village since the big flow that came down from the Monte Christallo.
When it is full moon, there is a blue light shining on the rock.
Each time the young boys want to go up and each time... and each time one cross more.
I planted a cross for my youngest son.
Tonio!. Tonio!.
Why are you so against that girl?.
She is not normal
How can she climb towards the blue light... on the steep side of the mountain... while the young boys fall down every time?.
This Junta, she's the damned devil's witch.
Do not close the shutters, it's such nice weather
It's a full moon.
Ah yes, the blue light...
My son... six months ago... he was the fourth victim this year...
Silvio!.
Silvio!.... Silvio!.
There she is, the devil's witch. Damm you!
It's all her fault, it's her fault.
Stop!
Guzzi! Guzzi!
Guzzi! Guzzi!
Guzzi... Guzzi!
Junta!
I'm here... I'm here.
Hey... what's the matter?. have some... eat.
I was on the street, early this morning
All of a sudden I saw a crowd in front of Maria's house
I heard Maria, who shouted :
""Junta, Junta!!!".
I was afraid and ran away... then I saw the threatening crowd.
They ran after me with sticks... they threatened me with their fists and they shouted : ""Aaaa... aaaaa... "
They threw stones at me... I was running but they came nearer and nearer...
Then a man jumped from a window... he stood there with his arm like this and shouted : ""Stop!".
Junta, where are you?.
Junta... Junta...
Junta!
Junta!
Hi! Ah... Hello...
What do you have there?.
Is that milk?.
Hey...
It's very nice here. I'd like to stay here...
Now I must go.
I want to leave here before it gets dark... but I will come again.
Tomorrow, I will come again
For sure.
So...
See you again.
Junta
See you again.
I wanted to say something
Tomorrow, I'll go back to the mountains.
I might stay over there for a few days... so do not get worried.
Junta!
Junta...
Junta!
Good day Sir.
So Junta, here I am again.
And this is a small contribution for our life in common.
This is bread.
Bread. I know.
Cheese.
How nice, how nice...
But where shall I sleep?.
I guess you sleep there... and the little boy over there...
And me?.
Sleeping?.
To sleep?.
To sleep!
Ah... I understand,
I understand.
But where?.
There... you can sleep here.
You' ll sleep very well.
Junta, little witch... you make me behave like a fool...
If only we could speak with each other it would be perfect.
I have been here for many weeks now and...
I'm afraid... I'm afraid...
I'll not go back ever... back to the people....
Ju nta... Ju nta... what's happen ing with you?.
Junta...
Iittle Junta...
What?.
Junta... Junta... what's happening with you?.
Come and show me what you brought from the village.
Let's have a look.
Junta...
Junta...
Junta... my little Junta...
How can I explain it to you... you cannot understand me...
What's the matter?.
Those crystals... they are a danger for you... and for the whole village.
But they could be a blessing.
The peasants should be told about it. Let me go now
Don't go.
Stay.
Stay with me.
It's a real treasure... it must be found... and brought to the village.
You'll never have to run around in these rag clothes anymore.
I'll come back.
Very soon
I'll come back.
See you!
It's not here... that you should climb
But here, at this side... till those rocks.
And then, do not climb there, but here, and you will find the entrance to the grotto.
We understand.
Goodnight.
Junta.
Junta!
Junta!
That's how the poor Junta of
Santa Maria died
But her memory lives on in the village, the people who persecuted her so much they got rich with the stones of the Monte Christallo.
End of the story of Junta
Man: Holly.
Holly.
What time is it now?
Just ten minutes later
Than when you asked before.
And do you think he'll get here in time?
He'll be here any minute now.
Take it easy, John.
Do you really have to tell him tonight?
Yes. Tonight.
I feel that it may be my last.
Now, now, now.
You know you're going to get better.
Holly...
What's become of your passion
For cold, scientific fact?
There he is now.
Hurry.
I believe my uncle's expecting me.
I'm Leo Vincey.
Yes, I can see that.
Hi, Vincey.
Come on in.
Thank you.
My name's Holly, Horace Holly.
Glad to know you.
Confound your English fog.
Our ship was a whole day late.
Well, thank heavens you're-- you're here in time.
Time?
What's all the rush?
Your cable said,
"catch first boat,
Greatest adventure in the world."
What's all the mystery?
You'll hear all about that from your uncle.
But there's one thing my cable didn't say--
John Vincey's dying.
Good lord.
What of?
Radium poisoning.
Hmm.
I haven't seen the old man since I was a kid.
He never quite got over
Our side of the family going american.
Why did he send for me?
There's no time to explain that now, every minute counts.
Come along in.
I'm sorry, sir, I couldn't get here any sooner.
Never mind that, my boy.
There's no time for explanations now.
Come closer.
Holly, did you ever see such a striking resemblance?
Extraordinary.
I'd already noticed it.
Look at that portrait.
Holly, turn on that light.
He does resemble me at that.
Or should I say that I resemble him?
That is your ancestor of a dozen generations ago.
Really?
John Vincey in the 15th century.
Wow. I must say we Vinceys
Have a way of looking like each other.
I have no time for explanations now, my boy.
I'm a man of science.
I'm not superstitious.
If I were,
I might imagine
That your resemblance to a man dead nearly 500 years
Is fate's way of showing me
That you will find again what he discovered.
What is that, sir?
The means of overcoming man's enemy.
Man's enemy?
My enemy, your enemy,
The enemy of all living things.
Careful, John.
That is what I mean, Leo.
That is the swinging march of man's enemy.
Time, bringing death--
Invisible, relentless death.
I guess nobody can stop that.
Who knows?
A lot of men have believed that they could--
Ponce de Leon,
Who searched for the fountain of youth,
Or those 15th-century alchemists
Who tried to discover the elixir of life.
But what connection has all this with me
Or John Vincey over there on the wall?
That's what your uncle's going to tell you.
Holly, get me the box.
Listen to me carefully, Leo.
I haven't time left to tell you more than once.
Uncle John, I don't think you should exert yourself--
Please, please.
What I am going to tell you is a secret
Handed down in our family from father to son.
The first John Vincey there
Did not go on his last great adventure alone.
His wife left their son in England to go with him.
For five years, they vanished from the world.
Then, one night in a town in northern Poland,
A woman-- ill, starving, dying--
Collapsed at the door of an English merchant.
He took her in and heard her ravings of hardship
And fantastic terror.
And that woman was
John Vincey's widow.
Before she died, she became more coherent,
Begged for someone to write a letter
To her family in England.
Here's the letter,
Dictated by that dying woman
Almost five centuries ago.
Yes, it is something of a puzzle.
Doesn't she tell what happened to John Vincey?
Here.
"so he was killed
Because he refused to abandon me."
Does it give any idea where they went to?
Not much, mentions the land of muscovy.
Russia, eh?
Or siberia or kamchatka--
All known as muscovy in the 15th century.
The place where he was killed
Was far, far north.
She escaped with their English servant.
They fell in with some natives
Who guided them back across a glacier
Over what she calls the schugle barrier.
And there, death struck again.
Holly, read it.
"then a great beast sprang on our guides
"and killed them all.
"my servant giles killed the beast,
"but died of his grievous wounds.
So I was left alone."
But what about the discovery you spoke of?
What'd they find?
John: Read on.
"in this strange land, we saw the flame.
"and he who stands therein comes forth unharmed
To triumph over death."
But John Vincey died there.
Why, if he found this, uh, this flame?
Because he was murdered.
But you are scientists.
Do you really take all this seriously?
Seriously?
Come, my boy.
I'll show you how seriously.
Come into the laboratory where Holly and I
Have done our lifework.
In the beginning,
I was as skeptical as you.
Then Holly and I,
Years ago...
In this very room,
Began our efforts to reproduce
John Vincey's life-prolonging flame.
We failed.
But our researches in radioactivity
Carried us far enough to make us believe
That such an element really exists.
An element to preserve life?
Yes.
Seventeen years in this room.
There's one other thing we ought to show him, John.
Here.
Can you make out the inscription?
Holly: It means, "here burns the flame of life."
That is the sole possession
Vincey's wife had left.
She sent it to the son she never saw again.
It's all so mysterious, it doesn't make sense.
This thing's gold, not an unknown element.
To be sure, it's gold.
It's only the symbol of the flame of life
John Vincey found.
Don't you understand?
I'm afraid I don't.
Flame destroys life.
A thousand volts of electricity will destroy life.
But increase the frequency,
And you may safely take a million volts
Through your body.
And the radiation from this unknown element,
This flame of life,
May be a million degrees hotter than any fire we know,
Or it may be as cold as ice. that's too much.
A cold flame?
Did you ever hear of a man being burned
By x-rays or radium?
Mm-hmm.
Did he feel himself being burned?
No. No more than I did myself.
This flame of life, Vincey, is pure radiation,
The most intense and flame-like radiation
In the whole universe.
Radiation from what?
From the unknown element.
Do you really believe such a thing exists?
We no longer believe, we know it exists.
Our experiments prove that.
That's right.
And they also prove something else.
This element cannot be artificially produced.
Only nature, only god can produce it.
But where?
In a glacial region of volcanic character.
That's largely guesswork, isn't it?
No!
Not if the family legend is true,
And I believe that it is.
I believe that John Vincey found that flame
And that it still burns
Somewhere remote and mysterious,
Offering eternal life.
That's why I've sent for you.
You're a Vincey,
The last of us.
Holly can't do it alone,
But he'll go with you.
John Vincey was an explorer.
It's in your blood, too,
And the love of-- of adventure.
Don't look upon this as a deathbed wish.
If you should try,
If you succeed,
I shan't be here.
But I hope that somehow I shall know
And somehow share in your triumph
When you say...
"here burns...
The flame of life."
Uncle John?
John?
John!
Holly: Let's hope this chap has some tea.
Leo: I'll take mine with a big reindeer steak.
Fine old northern hospitality--
Nothing in the world like it, they tell me.
Northern hospitality, eh?
Well, I'm blown.
I thought you were some of those
Infernal wandering chantos.
Can't take any chances with them.
Don't we know it-- stayed with a tribe of 'em last week.
Planning to stay here the night, I take it.
We hope so. Come 20 miles today.
Come in.
Come in.
Sit down, both of you.
There's a big stew on the stove just about ready,
Plenty to go around. yeah,
I'm--I'm glad of that.
Hey!
How about supper?!
Do we eat or don't we?!
Huh? Oh, that's my daughter Tanya.
Sit down.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Now, then, gents,
Do I understand you want to do business with me?
We heard you had the post furthest up country.
We thought you might be able
To help us get some natives to go on.
Where do you want to go?
Did you ever hear of the schugle barrier?
Why, yes. I've heard natives talk of it.
Leo, at last, we're on our way.
On your way where?
Over the schugle.
You're crazy.
Why?
You'll never get a native to guide you there.
We'll pay him well.
That ain't the point.
They're afraid to go, I tell ya.
Why?
Because no one who got over ever came back,
So far as I know.
Well, why didn't they come back?
What lies beyond the schugle?
More of the same, I suppose.
Of course, the natives have tales about it.
Well, what do they say?
I never paid much attention to their foolishness.
I can tell you.
You can? What is it?
The natives say that beyond the schugle,
There are terrible dangers.
They say--
Bah!
Yes? Go on.
Why, it's just a sort of legend.
Holly: What is the legend?
A long time ago, they believe,
A woman came out of the country
That lies far beyond the schugle.
What sort of woman?
A white woman.
She told them that she had escaped from a strange place.
Strange?
And if a man finds the way there,
He will never die. the catch in that
Is he dies before he gets there!
Hold your trap, Tanya, you gab too much.
Wait.
Is there anything in the story about fire?
A flame?
Anything you can connect with this?
No, I don't think so.
What's that?
Gold, ain't it?
Yes.
It is gold.
I see.
Well, now you begin to make sense.
So that's what lies beyond the schugle.
No. You don't understand.
Gold isn't what we're interested in.
Ah.
Suppose I could get a few natives to go on.
How much could you pay them?
Anything they asked.
Well, that's liberal enough.
Money no object, eh?
Lads...
No one can say old Dugmore ever let a white man down.
I'll get natives to go.
I'll run the outfit myself,
And you needn't pay me a penny.
How's that for an offer?
What?
What about those dangers you talked about?
I'll be frank with you gents--
I figure it's worth some risk
To be a partner in what you're after.
My dear sir, that's absurd.
You can't be a part in what we're looking for.
I said a partner.
You try to keep me out of this,
And I'll fix it so that no native in these parts
Will come within a thousand miles of ya. take it or leave it.
Dugmore: Tanya, here.
I tell you again, Dugmore, you're crazy.
You can't take a girl up there.
Oh, stop rowing about it.
I'm sick of hearing it.
We don't know what we're getting into.
What's your idea, then?
To leave her here alone
With no one around for 400 miles
Except a lot of wandering chantos
Who'd like to get even with me?
Anyhow, we want somebody to cook.
My dear, has anybody taken the trouble
To ask you what-- what you want to do?
I want to go.
There, you see?
She wouldn't leave her poor old pa.
Well, if there were anyplace to leave her,
I wouldn't let her come along.
Think you'll be all right?
I'm all right.
Come along, let's go.
Let's go.
Leo: Hey, Dugmore!
Look.
That may lead to a way over the schugle barrier.
What do you think?
Well, let's hope so.
We've followed that cliff for a week
Without finding a way through it.
Anyhow, it'll be a shelter from the wind,
And the dogs can't go on without a rest.
Hurry up with that food, Tanya.
It'll be ready as soon as I get it thawed out.
Hmm.
I wouldn't mind being thawed out myself.
Leo, this is no place to camp.
But Dugmore says the dogs need a rest.
I don't like it.
Sitting down here under this wall of ice,
It's--it's dangerous.
What's the matter with you now?
What's dangerous?
There you are.
Well, what of it?
You've heard that several times lately.
In this narrow place,
Any noise might start vibrations
Which might cause an avalanche.
Merely shouting might do it.
Aw, pipe down.
Who's lived in the north for 20 years, me or you?
Lecture yourself out of that, professor.
You...
Hurry up with that grub.
I still don't like it.
Mmm, smells good.
Tastes good, too-- snow rabbits.
The ones I shot?
Oh, I'll fix that.
You don't have to help me.
But I want to.
You think having me along is a nuisance.
Oh.
We couldn't get along without you.
I wish you really meant that.
I do, honest.
Because I can cook? well, not only that,
But there's another reason...
Your father.
If it weren't for you, I couldn't get along with him for a minute.
But with you here, I find him at least bearable.
I know.
That isn't very nice of me, is it?
I can't blame you, but...
I understand.
He's your father.
You see, I was brought up
By the Russian sisters at Yuroshi.
The convent broke up about a year ago,
And--and he came and took me to the trading post.
He said he was my father.
Oh, I begin to understand.
Well, it's all right, really.
But it isn't all right.
When we get back from this trip,
I'll teach him how a girl like you ought to be treated.
If I had a daughter like you,
Don't you think I'd love her and show her that I do?
Would you?
Why, of course I would.
I don't see how he can help loving you.
Why, you're...You're--
Vincey!
Vincey! Holly! Holly!
What's up?
The natives have just come down from the glacier,
Shrieking something about a white man.
Let's go up and see what it's about.
They'll show us the way.
Come on.
By the lord Harry.
What a beast.
Holly, what is it?
Unless I'm barmy, it's-- it's a saber-toothed tiger.
Think of it, man!
That's a new one on me.
Saber-toothed tiger--
They've been extinct for thousands of years, haven't they?
In all known parts of the world, yes.
But here...
They must've been preserved in that ice for-- for 400 to 500 years.
They must've camped in this glacier.
Look how that man's dressed!
Holly, the servant--
The faithful servant who was with John Vincey's wife.
What'd the parchment say, remember?
By Jove, Leo, you're right.
He killed the great beast, but died of the wounds it gave him.
And she escaped alone, remember?
Holly, we found our way, the way to the flame.
Look.
That stiff's got a chain around his neck,
And there's a ripped canvas bag.
It's gold.
This ice ain't so thick, and with this ax--
Don't be a fool!
You heard what Holly said
About any vibration causing an avalanche.
Oh, the professor says a lot of things.
Come on, let's get out of here.
Dugmore!
Dugmore!
Dugmore!!!
Stop it, you fool!
Aah!!
Ohh!! Aah!!
There's no hope for the others.
You know that.
I know.
No sledges, no food, and no way back.
And no way forward.
Holly, look.
This was covered by the glacier.
It may lead through the barrier.
Tanya?
All right.
At least this is a shelter from the wind.
Interesting formation.
Pity there isn't more light.
Oh, I'm tired.
Poor kid, you've had a tough time of it.
Leo! Leo, Tanya!
Come quick!
Look.
There's our way.
Our way? Where?
What are you talking about?
Don't you understand?
They're fumeroles, volcanic formation--
One hour ago, ice, glacial ice--
And now, volcanic heat.
I get it-- what uncle John talked about.
We could never get through.
Of course we can.
Listen, Tanya,
When I wanted to leave you at the trading post,
What'd you say?
Why, I said I wanted to go.
All right, come on.
Sulfur, of course.
Phosphorus, too.
That accounts for the glow.
Well, that's the last of 'em.
Can't we rest a bit?
Look, there's more light.
Yes, and another opening.
Aah!
Just a minute, Leo, give 'em a chance to show if they're friendly.
Try your lingo, Tanya.
We--we greet you, my friend.
Nagu-da.
Other natives:
Nagu-da, nagu-da.
Nagu-da.
Thank you.
Nagu-da.
Say it to him, Leo.
Well, what does it mean?
"good day" or "how are you?" or "greetings"
Or something of the kind.
Don't--don't judge
'em by their looks.
They're most probably a very friendly people.
Show your confidence in them.
You know what it means, Tanya?
No.
It's all right, we're coming.
Well, they seem awfully pleased to see us, don't they?
Thank you, thank you.
Nagu-da.
Nagu-da.
You see?
I was right.
They're just kind, hospitable, simple people.
I'm not sure they're so simple.
Leo, do you realize what we're eating?
Some sort of melon.
It's a pre-melon, something like papaya.
What of it?
What of it?
Tropical fruit here in the arctic?
It means there's some sort of fertile country
Somewhere beyond these caves.
It may be what we're looking for.
All: huh.
Huh!
Huh!
This doesn't look so good to me.
Huh!
Nonsense.
I suspect it's a ceremony of welcome.
Huh!
Huh!
Huh!
Huh!
Huh! Huh!
Huh!
Huh!
Huh!
Huh!
Huh!
Huh!
Huh!
Huh!
Huh!
Huh!
Huh!
Huh!
Huh!
Huh!
Huh!
Leo.
Steady, Tanya, steady.
Huh!
Huh!
Huh!
Huh!
Huh!
Huh!
What's up now?
As I told you, a ceremony of welcome.
Huh!
Huh!
Huh!
Huh!
Huh!
Huh! Huh! Huh!
I don't like this.
Oh, nonsense, it's-- it's most interesting.
Come with me.
Aah!!!
Uhh!
Leo!
Are you all right, Leo?
Nagu-da?
I...I-I-I thought...
Steady, Leo.
Leo, you are hurt.
Holly, watch him.
Tanya: Wait, please!
Old gentleman...
My friend, him very sick.
No can walk.
You get out...Out.
Let him...Ride.
Oh, Holly, I'm trying to tell him
That Leo can't walk any further.
Holly: You old idiot,
Can't you see for yourself he's hurt?
Oh!
Holly, he's dying.
No, no, Tanya.
Bad concussion, I'm afraid. do not be afraid.
He will not die.
But--but how can you know English?
I have a wise teacher who knows all tongues.
But wait, wait.
Who--who was your teacher?
What is this place?
Where are we going?
What--what's gonna happen?
You will learn your fate from hash-a-mo-tep.
Tanya, Tanya.
It's all right, Leo.
I say, this is incredible!
What is this place?
Country of kor.
Kor?
Tanya, think of it--
You're seeing something
That nobody ever dreamed existed.
Hush.
Aren't you interested?
No.
That mountain...
There are stairs and a great door.
What is it?
It's the palace of hash-a-mo-tep,
Hollowed in the heart of the mountain.
Woman:
Speak in English, then,
So the strangers may understand.
Returning from the journey on which you sent me,
I passed the place where dwelled the peoples
Of the caves.
I weary of those people.
There, I found these strangers fighting for their lives.
The cave people would have killed them.
Against my order, known these many years
That any stranger must be brought to me unharmed?
Have not their fathers and their fathers' fathers
Taught them that my word is law?
They await your judgment, o queen.
They shall not go unpunished.
What is your name, stranger?
Holly, o queen.
Welcome, Holly,
Though you are not he for whom I wait.
But I don't understand.
Why should you?
What do you know of immortal dreams,
Immortal memories?
But who are you?
I am yesterday and today and tomorrow.
I am sorrow and longing and hope unfulfilled.
I am hash-a-mo-tep, she--
She who must be obeyed.
I am...I.
But you speak my language.
How is that?
I learned it from a countryman of yours
Long ago.
What's that?
You mean there's been another Englishman here
In your lifetime?
Who? How long ago?
See that the strangers are well-treated, Billali.
I will decide later what they shall do.
And the other one?
The other?
A young man, wounded in the fight.
I thought-- you thought?!
Bring him to me at once!
It's not enough that I should wait in hope
Unending years in pain.
Then you forget my orders, disobey my commands.
Who gives you leave to think contrary to my will?!
Nearer, bring him nearer.
That's it!
Aah!!!
John Vincey...John Vincey!
Oh, my love...
My dearest love.
At last.
You're hurt.
Billali...
Billali, take him to my chamber.
Through the forbidden door?
Yes.
And bear him gently.
Please let me go with him!
Who are you?
You are his wife?
No! I'm nothing to him!
But he needs someone!
He will not be alone.
Tanya: No!! Leo!!
Oh, please, please let me go!
Let me go with him, I tell you!
Let me go! Leo!
Leo!
I--I just had to see how he is.
What gives you so much courage?
Can you help him?
He will wake from his sleep refreshed and well.
There's no need to fear.
Are you sure?
Yes. Look if you will.
Then leave.
How often have I watched beside him lying so.
But now, this is warm.
Flesh.
He needs nothing you have to give.
Go now.
Go before he wakes.
And forget him.
He is not for you.
Why do you hate me?
Hate you?
Why, you're nothing.
Nothing.
Once, long ago,
A woman like you destroyed my happiness.
The same thing shall not happen again.
How's Leo?
Leo?
You know, my friend.
Vincey.
Vincey. Oh, yes.
Have no fear.
She will heal him.
I see.
Look here...
You're the most important man in the country, aren't you?
I have served she continuously for more than half a century.
What?! Half a century?
You're joking.
You think I'm too young?
Oddly enough, I wasn't thinking about you.
What are you doing?
It's an old English custom.
What is it?
Smoking. Don't you smoke?
Smoke and fire.
Do you worship the flame?
Of course, old boy.
Don't you?
It will soon be time for the yearly offering
In the hall of kings.
There you may see the sacred fires rekindled
If she permits you to be present.
You think if I showed her this?
What's the matter?
What does it mean?
Are you tired of life?
Then question she concerning that.
But tell me...
Who is this who stands in fire?
Ask no more questions,
I tell you.
It is she's own secret.
Put it away.
Very well.
I thought that you might know.
How should I know?
She goes alone.
Alone?
On such a long journey?
Long journey?
No. There in the hall of--
You're cunning.
I said too much already.
Well, just tell me one more thing.
How long has she ruled over kor?
All her life.
But...
Tanya, what's happened?
She wouldn't let me stay.
She is with Leo.
You saw him?
He's still asleep.
She says he'll be well when he wakes.
Oh, but, Holly, Holly, I'm afraid.
I--I feel something evil about her.
She would not let you stay to speak with him?
You mean that she is planning to keep us apart?
What nonsense.
Leo will have something to say about that.
You think so?
But you may see him.
She has commanded that you both be present at the trial.
You mean the trial of the men who attacked us?
Punishment of the men who injured him.
What does it mean?
She knows Leo.
She says he belongs to her.
She called him John Vincey.
But, Holly, how could she know John Vincey?
How could she?
I want to believe it.
Suppose it's true?
Suppose it's true?!
Did you dream I was watching while you slept?
I dreamed of a man dead for centuries.
And you called me by his name.
Dreams are only memories
In the endless flow of time.
Who are you?
Drink.
Had I known you were coming,
You would've been welcomed like a king.
Where are my friends?
Take the food.
Be strong again.
But Tanya, the girl who was--
She is here in my palace.
I remember vaguely.
Someone brought us here...
And you said-- what?
It's all foggy now.
Who are you?
You do not remember?
How can I?
I've never seen you before.
I was so sure when you came at last
You would remember.
I was so sure you could not forget.
I have summoned slaves to attend you.
Later, you will hear my judgment on those
Who dared attack you.
But wait...
Tell me, how is it you speak my language?
And still, you do not understand.
I say, Tanya, what-- what's the meaning of this?
Where'd you get that outfit?
From the old man.
Billali?
He said I was to put it on and look as well as I could.
I wonder why he cares how you look.
Good. Young man will be pleased.
How is Leo?
That, you will soon discover for yourself.
Come.
If he's well, he will go back to his own country?
Oh, yes.
Why, of course he will.
Then, I hope he'll soon be well enough to travel.
Tanya...And Holly.
Glad to see ya, how are ya?
That's just what
I was gonna ask you,
But there's no need.
Listen, Leo, I think
I've got some big news for you.
Leo, are you sure you're all right?
How do I look?
Want me to squeeze ya and try my strength?
Listen to this, I pumped old Billali about the flame--
Shh!
She summons you.
Sit near the throne.
Go ahead, o king.
Aw. Come on, the both of ya.
You alone.
You two, come with me.
Huh?
Well, Leo, I'll see you later.
Got lots to tell you.
There are marvels to be seen today.
A stranger shares the throne,
Where I may scarce approach.
Hmm.
Come.
I've summoned you, Holly,
That you may observe how justice is meted out in kor.
Let the prisoners stand forth.
You earth-born people...
You haunters of darkness,
How you try my patience.
Point out those who were reckless enough
To lay hands upon you.
Well, I'll point out those I'm sure of.
Those two men there.
And this one.
This man.
I believe he was the leader.
That's all.
Only four, out of all those men, attacked you?
That's all I'm sure of.
They will die.
What?
They shall be put to death.
But I don't want that.
Would you spare them?
Oh, yes...A christian.
I'd almost forgotten.
I remember in the market place of Jerusalem,
They spoke of a man who taught mercy and forgiveness.
A man who died
So that others might live,
As though death could beget life.
Tell them to stand up, Billali.
Aah!!
No!!
How could you be so calm
And send people to their deaths like that?
Silence!
Is the girl also tired of life?
I'm not afraid of you.
Tanya.
She: There is an end of my indulgence.
Come away, Tanya.
Leo: Yes, Holly, go with her.
I'm the one who spoke out of turn.
We don't want these fellows butchered
Just because we had a fight with them.
Punish them if you like, but-- but not that.
Do you think I'm cruel for the sake of cruelty?
Then why do you torture them?
How do you think I rule these people?
It's not by force.
It's by terror.
My empire is of the imagination.
Still, I beg you, stop this.
Thanks. That makes me feel a lot better,
All of us.
And don't hold anything against Tanya.
What is that girl to you?
Nothing, I...I feel responsible for her.
May I--do you mind if I go now?
I'd like to tell her everything's all right.
Go, then.
Yes, Billali?
The prisoners...
Are they to be turned back to the caves?
No. Kill them.
All?
All. Kill them.
Make an end.
Would I could kill my fears so easily.
She's wicked, I tell you.
Don't be too hard on her, Tanya.
She's strange...
And wonderful.
Well, after all, she didn't go through with it.
She would've killed them, except for you.
Listen, Leo, I've got it.
Got what?
We're going to find out everything we want to know
Through you.
Good idea, huh?
What is there to find out
Except how to escape from this horrible place?
You should've seen Billali when I showed him this.
Almost knocked his forehead on the floor,
Frightened out of his wits.
Said it was she's secret.
Well, why didn't you tell me?
All in good time.
We don't know the secret yet,
But I'll wager pounds to pence
That you're the one person who can get it from her.
Leo, please don't go to her.
Don't you worry, Tanya.
Holly, I'm going to get to the bottom of this.
If she knows where the flame burns,
We're going to find it.
Leo...
It's hard to be kept waiting when one has waited so long.
You must have known I'd come.
Do you think blind chance brought you here?
I came because of an old story.
A woman escaped from this country
And told of a strange adventure
And died.
She left this for her son.
This woman was the wife of--
John Vincey.
John Vincey died 500 years ago.
How can you know his name?
Think back, far back.
Oh, my beloved...
You will, you can--
Another life, a far-off forgotten place...
This place.
And my voice uttering words you vowed to remember
Through endless time.
Think.
Your voice?
You...Were you the same?
Always to you, always,
Offering all, wanting all.
You mean, we...
I can't believe...
I have no memories.
I will show you how to look across the mist of time.
That one moment out of all the centuries.
That one instant when
I felt myself beloved.
Who was that man?
You do not know?
No, it can't be.
I dare not believe it.
You will believe.
Come.
Do you wonder whose feet have worn away this rock?
Once, this stair was new and level.
But I've passed here day by day.
And, see, my sandals
Have eaten off the solid stone.
Now, in a moment, you will remember that other life.
I...I see myself.
Swept by the tides of time
Back to my arms.
Centuries ago, you were someone else,
As I was this man here.
No, no. I'm the same.
My life and youth endured.
All through the years,
I've mourned here where your body lay.
But now...
You are reborn,
And my mourning has ended.
Your coming is the sign of my forgiveness.
Forgiveness?
For what?
I know why you've come to call.
You seek the flame of life.
Even as I came, a young girl,
So many lives ago.
I took the burden of immortality upon my shoulders
And wore it through unbelievable years--
Dark, with a loneliness
Through which there shone a single light,
Fixed and unwavering--
The hope of love...
And so I waited,
Waited for a bridegroom
Whose passion for life would be as fierce as my own.
You came, John Vincey,
And I loved you.
For one moment, you were mine.
Then you turned from me.
You had not come alone.
And, in my jealousy, I...
I killed you.
Again, I waited, seeming longer than before.
But I knew you must return.
Your love of life must be stronger than death.
And now you're here,
Nothing shall stand between us.
But I'm not John Vincey.
Oh, my love.
Take away my eyes.
Let darkness utterly shut me in,
And still my ears would know the sound
Of your unforgotten voice.
If I could only remember.
If you've forgotten me,
Then that woman who held you in spite of me...
You've forgotten her as well?
Yes.
I've forgotten.
She wasn't beautiful.
She had no wisdom such as mine.
Yet, you could never quite leave her.
I've forgotten everything but you.
Everything-- no, no.
Now, as then, we two are made of different clay.
Until you are as I am, come no nearer.
Today, in the hall of kings,
The priest makes sacrifice in gratitude
For my enduring youth.
Then you shall come with me
And share my secret.
Leo!
I say, Leo, what did you find out?
I've seen John Vincey.
What?
I tell you, I saw him!
Now, be reasonable.
John Vincey's been dead for--for 500 years.
I--I tell you, I--
I saw him lying there.
Holly, it was I, myself.
Now, one thing at a time.
You mean a mummified body that looked like you?
No, no, Holly.
I saw myself lying there.
Are you trying to make me believe in reincarnation?
Rats! You knew before
That you were the image of John Vincey.
We both knew that.
She has been waiting for me to come back.
She says I am John Vincey.
Leo, don't listen to her!
Let's get away while there's time.
Holly, she is going to show me the flame.
What? Do you hear that, Tanya?
Well, why didn't you say so in the first place?
When?
When do we go?
You are not to see it.
But you said--
I said she promised me the secret.
Well, then, I see.
Only you?
Yes.
Oh.
You can't stay here.
You'll go back the way we came, you and Tanya,
As soon as the temple ceremony is over.
You'll be protected.
Then I go to the flame.
Leo...
Don't lose your head,
Use it!
I haven't lost my head.
I've found memories you can't even imagine.
I've seen strangeness, beauty, power--
Yes, immortality--
And I can share it.
But only I.
Those are her terms.
What man would say no?
Be fair.
Very well.
I'll take Tanya back with me.
But let me tell you one thing, Leo--
You're a fool,
And you'll die for your folly
Like your ancestor
John Vincey.
Leo.
I'm sorry, Tanya.
Don't think of me, think of yourself.
I am thinking of myself.
To live forever, it's--
It's what all men have dreamed of.
What's the use of living a thousand years,
If you're going on being cruel and selfish?
Is a thousand years of that any better than 70?
But people would change, grow good.
Has she grown good?
Yes.
Did she let
John Vincey escape?
Would she let you escape if...
If you loved me?
Tanya, I...
You're not tempted as I am.
Think of it-- never to grow old, never to feel age.
I can't give it up.
You will live here in this--this tomb...
Always young with her.
You will never know age nor grief.
That isn't the kind of love I want.
What is it you want?
Why...
Why..
Just two people to live together
And to love each other.
To laugh at little things and--
And sometimes cry over big ones.
To share what-- whatever comes along.
And to grow old together.
And, someday,
When one is gone...
To hope to be together again somewhere.
That isn't much to offer, is it?
Compared to kingdoms and power and glory
That will never change.
Tanya...
Hail, Vincey!
Hash-a-mo-tep sends me to tell you
That the festival of the sacred well
Will begin at the setting of the sun.
You and Holly will be guided through the hall of kings.
And Tanya?
The lady may not come.
No woman may view the ceremony of the well
But the maidens of the temple.
I don't want to see any more ceremonies.
I'm going to talk to Holly again.
Tanya...
Man: Stop--
Tanya: I must,
I've got to talk to her!
Oh, why can't I make you understand?
I'm sorry, I...
They wouldn't let me pass, and I had to see you.
Well?
You--you are sending us away.
You will return to your own country.
Yes, I know.
Leo told us.
But...Please...
What is it you want?
Let Leo come with us.
Send him away, too.
Send him away?
Are you mad?
Please.
He came here following a dream--
A dream men have followed
Since the first son saw his father die.
He alone, of all men, has realized that dream,
And you ask me to send him away,
To send him back to you
And your little mortal love.
No, no. Even if he never loves me...
Why, I have to make you understand.
It's not for myself.
I'm pleading for him.
You're pleading for him?
What can you or the world you live in offer him
That will last longer than a miserable human life?
After the festival in the hall of kings,
There will be slaves waiting at the outer wall
To guide you in safety to your little world.
Go now.
Go if you fear my anger.
Then if you won't send him back,
Well, will you let me stay here
Where I can see him sometimes?
What harm can that do?
What can it take away from you?
You will have everything.
You will have him.
I shall have nothing
If you take away being near him.
I'm taking nothing away from you that was ever yours.
He has been mine since...
Why do I stand here talking with you?
Go now!
Why are you afraid of me?
Afraid?
You are afraid.
And now I see why.
Because I'm human, and you're not.
Because I'm young,
And you know love belongs to the young.
Your magic makes you seem young,
But in your heart, you're old, old!
You were young once like me, but now you're old,
And it's too late for love forever.
He will never love you.
I know that now.
Keep him here!
Make him king over your slaves and savages!
But he will never love you!
Never! Never! Never!
Go!
She came here from his arms.
The sacrifice within the hour
In the hall of kings...
He shall sit beside you on the throne
And watch her die
And not know.
Who can be blamed if she wanders away,
And no one can find her?
Send men to search.
Show concern for his sorrow.
All the while knowing that he watched her die.
And she, through her veil,
Saw him watching.
Tanya: What is this?!
Where are you taking me?!
What is this?
What are they doing?
It is she's command.
She sends you as an offering to the flame.
No! Leo!
Leo!
Foolish one.
Would you destroy him, too?
If he could hear you, if he knew your fate,
What could he do?
Let him try to save you,
And he will be set upon by soldiers and priests.
He will die with you.
But he shall not know.
This is a happy festival for kor...
The happiest of all for me.
That girl they're bringing in,
What does she do?
She carries to the gods my gratitude
For the gift of enduring life.
Carries to the...How?
You shall see.
Is she a dancer, too?
No...
She will not dance.
Is this a human sacrifice?
It's the immemorial custom of the people of kor.
Is that...?
No, it can't be.
Who is that girl?
Who is it?
Is it Tanya?
It's Tanya!!
Take her to the stairs.
Through those doors!
Ohh!!
Aah!!
Aah!!
Ohh! Ohh!
You found my temple,
But you came the dangerous way.
Here is what you sought.
So the flame of life has leapt from the earth
Since time began.
What does the flame or anything else matter now?
I want no power you have to give.
I want nothing you have to give.
He thinks he loves you now.
I can wait.
Wait?
For what?
For you to grow old.
Until then, you will be cared for
As my dearest possession.
And he?
He will bathe in the flame and be as I am.
You will grow old, withered, ugly.
And when at last, repelled, he turns from you,
I shall be standing by his side unchanged.
And if I won't go in the flame?
You have no choice.
If you refuse, the girl shall die.
Kill me, then!
You mean, if I refuse to go in the flame,
You'll have her killed?
Oh, Leo,
I'd rather die now.
I'll always love you,
Tanya.
No, no.
Trust me.
Believe in my love.
I'm ready.
No, Leo, it's a trick!
How do you know you won't be burned alive?
If I stand in the flame
And come forth unharmed,
Then will you follow?
I will.
Don't think you can go unpunished forever.
Somewhere, there's a power
That won't let such wickedness and cruelty go on.
Your hair will whiten.
Your eyes will lose their brightness.
Your cheeks will wrinkle.
Your limbs will wither...
While I defy the years and laugh at time.
I call upon the flame most powerful, most swift--
Preserver of life and youth and beauty.
Your eyes will lose their brightness.
Your cheeks will wrinkle.
Your limbs will wither.
While I defy the years
And laugh at time.
Now do you believe
I spoke the truth?
My love.
I can't see you clearly.
My eyes...
The flame.
My voice sounds strange to my ears.
I die.
I die!
Have pity on my shame.
I remember, long ago,
A garden...
In the sun.
Dead?
Dead!
She cannot die!
A party of slaves that were to guide you.
The gold symbol...
We'll be safe.
She told me.
The greatest secret in the world,
And we're turning our backs on it.
Holly: "she staggered to the ground,
"a withered creature, incredibly old.
"and so she died terribly and pitifully
"even as her lips spoke of eternal life.
"but though she was dead,
"the power of her golden symbol reached out and held us safe.
"and so, after incredible adventures,
"we escaped to the outer world.
"and thus we lived to record the story
In this manuscript."
It seems as though it couldn't have happened.
Why, no one could believe it
Unless they'd been there with us.
Now that we're safe in this friendly world,
Do you know, I feel sorry for her.
We never shall know what really did happen.
I sometimes think
That her bathing in the flame a second time
Was an overexposure
To that terrifically powerful unknown element.
And sometimes I think that such--
Such inhuman immortality was never meant to be,
And some greater power than she
Reached out and-- and destroyed her.
After all, Holly,
Perhaps there is no real flame of life.
I think there is.
What?
Yes. Right here.
Holly: Here?
In this fireplace--
The flame in any fireplace
In any home where two people live and love each other...
And in their hearts.

It's a boy!
A prince is born!
Long live the Prince of Wales!
Sit up and drink hearty.
The only cost of a tankard is that it's drunk to His wee Royal Highness...
The Prince of Wales!
Long live His Royal Highness, the Prince of Wales!
Here.
Milords and ladies...
I ask you to toast my son...
Edward Tudor.
One moment.
You drink too fast.
I advise you that as you drink, you pray for your own sakes... that my son be a good king.
Because good or bad, sickly or hale... craven or brave, he will be King!
You drank sparingly, my good Norfolk.
Wine does not agree with me,
Your Majesty.
A pity.
Because losing one's head from wine... is so much less permanent than losing it from treason.
Surely, Your Majesty does not think me guilty of that.
Not at all, my good Norfolk.
Merely capable of it.
- It's a boy, Henry.
- So I've been informed.
- You're glad?
- Very.
And grateful to you, madam... not only for furnishing the House of Tudor with an heir... but also for freeing your King from further necessity of your being.
Poor little thing.
Brought into this world to wear a crown whether it fits him or not.
It shall weigh him down... until he'll wish he'd been born to the meanest pauper in London.
Poor little thing.
Poor nothing.
He's a healthy brat.
Healthy, is he?
You'd have an healthy son, when all the time... you know it's only the sickly ones who can beg a farthing nowadays.
A prince was born tonight, too, little baby.
So go to sleep and pretend the bells are for you.
Here he is. I think this cur ought to have his head whacked off!
Boil him in oil, I says, Your Highness.
A good stewing is what he needs.
Let's give it to him.
- What has he done, my good lords?
- He won't play, that's what.
Let this miscreant kneel before me.
Down, you scurvy nipper.
Why don't you want to play, bumpkin?
'Cause I don't want to be boiled in oil.
It'd hurt.
Coward!
Hold your tongue. He's right. It would hurt.
A good king is a merciful king.
I will show mercy.
If I make you one of my lords, will you play?
Yes, I will.
I dub thee Sir Hawkins.
Arise.
Absit invidia'
What's that?
It's Latin. And it means:
Let there be no malice.
Father Andrew taught it to me.
He'd do better to teach you how to bring home a farthing.
I'll knock them royal ideas out of your head!
You drooling beast,
I'll cuff your mouth and like it!
Now, then!
He's certainly thumping the King good.
Maybe that'll keep the tears in your eyes long enough to beg a penny for food.
Now, be off with you!
May I come in?
But you are in.
Thomas, have you been crying?
No, sir. It's sweat.
You see, I've been running.
And how did you come by that?
Your father?
No, sir. My father wouldn't beat me.
He likes me.
I apologize.
Thank you.
Someday I'm going to discuss you with your father.
No, I wouldn't, sir.
You see, he doesn't like to see anyone... on account of he feels so badly about me having to beg.
I thought maybe you'd let me read some more out of that Latin book.
Of course.
The more you read, the greater opportunity you'll have... of escaping Offal Court when you grow up.
But you've read most everything, and you're still in Offal Court, Father.
God's will and the whimsy of a king are two things... it isn't for ordinary people to understand,
I presume, Tom.
Why did His Majesty turn you out of your house... and take away your pension, when you didn't do anything to him?
I'm afraid nowadays, the King knows very little about his subjects.
Except those in his court... who take great pains he shouldn't learn... the plight of others less fortunate than themselves.
Do you know what I'd do if I were the King?
I'd send the Prince out to play with other little boys.
Then he'd learn about the people and be a good king when he grew up.
A rather unlikely suggestion.
Get on with your reading while the light is good.
Perhaps I'd better, because I've been at it two days now... and I haven't got Caesar across the Rubicon yet.
Tell me all about it.
I'll tell you, there's more gold there than you ever thought was in the world... just dying to be took.
- What's that you're reading?
- A book.
- Stole it?
- No.
Father Andrew gave it to me. To keep.
Wasn't that kind of him?
I should say so. It's very valuable.
Only rich people can afford to buy books.
- Give it here.
- Please don't tear it.
Tear it, you barmy mooncalf? I'll sell it.
This'll fetch a nice bit of meat and ale.
Please, give me back my book.
Come on, Hugo.
We're going to the thieves market.
A windfall from heaven, I calls it.
And if I catch you with that smirking priest again...
I'll peel the hide off both of you!
My book.
Go away! Get out of here! Go on!
Penny, please?
But it is time we spoke of certain things,
Your Majesty.
My death among them, I suppose.
Death?
What made you think of death, sire?
For one thing, finding a carrion crow flying around my bed.
Banish the thought, sire.
- You're still a hale man.
- I'm not a man at all.
I'm a disease.
An infernally painful one. Go on.
It occurred to me, sire, that when
Prince Edward comes to the throne...
The court may impose the Duke of Norfolk on him... as Lord High Protector.
And with reason, Hertford.
What a sorry thing it is to be a bad king.
To worry on your deathbed about your dynasty... and not about your people.
To be able to forgive a man his sins, and not his virtues.
And Norfolk has virtue.
And the House of Tudor has sins.
But they won't be judged by the Howards.
You are very right, Your Majesty.
The protector will be a man who nibbles at the hand of the court.
Whose power frightens only the ladies.
And whose chief ambition is to build a safe nest in the throne.
You'll forgive me if I say the description resembles that of a palace rat.
- You mean...
- I mean you.
I am unable to tell my gratitude for this honor, sire.
But it will enable me to...
To regret my passing with the greatest possible pleasure.
There is one thing, sire... which may prevent your selection of me from being carried out.
- Who? Warwick?
- No, sire.
The Prince himself.
Norfolk has bewitched him.
He worships the man, calls him uncle.
But for some strange reason,
His Highness has taken a dislike to me.
If you let the selection go, until your death...
His little Highness will undoubtedly appoint Norfolk.
No.
Because I intend to arrange matters... so that Norfolk's death will precede my own.
- Indeed, Your Majesty?
- Indeed.
Now, ask His Highness to come here.
I think I'd like to play now.
May we play charades, Your Highness?
Lady Jane, I've told you I hate charades.
I'm sorry.
All right. We'll play charades later.
After we play something I like.
Quill, you suggest something.
And if it doesn't suit me, I'll beat you.
And if it does suit you, it'll be a game you'll beat me at anyway.
Therefore, it might as well be... blind man's buff.
Good. That would amuse me.
- I'm it.
- Here's my handkerchief.
- Should I be first, sir?
- Shout so I know where you are.
All right.
Spin him round and around.
There you are.
Now, guess where we are.
Your Highness.
- Are you hurt, Edward?
- Edward?
Pardon me, Your Highness.
Someday I'll have your head cut off for calling me that.
But perhaps your feet would be better.
They're more in the way.
Why are you here, milord?
His Majesty awaits, Your Highness.
Very well.
You are not dismissed. I'm coming back.
I'm glad you sent for me, Father.
They wouldn't let me see you this afternoon.
- You tried?
- Yes.
- What did you want?
- Nothing. Just wanted to see you.
Come here.
Sit down.
One of these days, Edward...
- I'll be going away.
- To war, Father?
No. To peace, I hope.
But where?
To face the one being... who knows there is no
Divine Right of Kings.
After I've gone, Edward, you'll wear the crown.
- But...
- Be still. Listen and remember.
There is only one crown in England.
But there are many heads it will fit.
So a wise king removes those heads.
That is politics.
When you sit in judgment... remember your seat is but a chair... made by the English oak, hewn by English yeomen... and made into a throne only... by the will of the English people.
That is patriotism.
There's one thing more.
A king may answer to no man.
Not even to himself.
To have a conscience is to have a chink in your armor... to let in the knives of those you love... and trust, and need.
Remember what I am saying.
Never trust so much...
Love so much... or need anyone so much... that you can't betray them with a smile.
That is the paradox of power.
I suppose you're too young to understand that.
No, Father. I can even understand Aristotle in the original Greek.
You're like your mother.
- What was my mother like?
- A dull woman.
- She'd have bored you.
- No, she wouldn't. I'd have loved her.
Where is she?
Got another biscuit?
Your Majesty forgot to mention your selection to His Highness.
Bring me that casket.
- Do you know what this is?
- Yes, Father. The Great Seal of England.
There's strange magic in it, Edward.
It can make a royal whim a law.
An innocent man guilty.
A poor man rich.
A dangerous toy for a child... and a fool.
I advise you to use it sparingly and seldom.
Lest it seal your own doom.
I am entrusting it to you.
When the time comes for you to use it...
I want you to consult...
- Doctors again.
- Your Majesty.
You must be left undisturbed.
Milords, you must leave
His Majesty at once.
- Rest is the only physic that will cure him.
- Is there no escape from you?
After a lifetime of dodging cannonballs, am I to be done in by pills?
Your Majesty, can that be a biscuit?
What do you think it is, the Archbishop's head?
May I ask, Your Highness, and you, Lord Hertford... to retire, for the King's good?
Yes, of course.
Your Majesty.
Tomorrow.
- Tomorrow.
- But, Your Majesty...
Get out!
All of you!
- You, too.
- Yes, Father.
Yes, Father.
- Good night.
- Good night, Father.
Where are Lady Jane and Lady Elizabeth?
Their nurse came to inform them that it was their bedtime.
- My dog, where is he?
- He's been taken to the kennels.
- Fetch him.
- Your Highness, this is our post.
If we leave it, we would have to answer to the King himself.
Is that a dog under there?
- A boy.
- Out of there, you little tyke.
- Out of there!
- Yes, Father.
Impertinent from the likes of you.
A sneak thief? How did you get in here?
I'm not a thief, sir. I just beg.
You've just begged yourself a skinful of broken bones this time.
Maybe this will teach you respect for His Majesty's Guard.
Maybe that will teach you respect for His Majesty's subjects.
- Your Highness, forgive me, I...
- Keep quiet.
Are you hurt, boy?
- Are you hurt?
- No, sir, Your Highness, sir.
- What are you doing here, boy?
- It was raining, Your Highness.
I just slipped through, milord, because...
So I could sleep under the bench where it was dry, Your Highness.
I'm not a desperate character,
Your Highness. Honest, I'm not.
I'm certain you're not.
Had you been, the Captain would've been under the bench, not you.
- Your Highness, you don't understand.
- Keep quiet.
You annoy me enough when you're silent.
You're not thinking of beheading me, are you, Your Majesty?
No.
I was wondering whether or not you were too dirty to play with.
You couldn't play with me.
I'm a beggar boy.
I can play with anyone I please.
I'm the Prince.
Come along.
We'll wait for him to come out from beneath His Highness' wing.
And when he does, we'll skin him.
I didn't think that if I were very good all my life... and died and went to heaven,
I'd ever see anything like this.
- Or meet a real prince, either.
- Don't bother to flatter me.
I get enough of that from the court.
I must remember to have the Captain beheaded when I'm king.
No, you mustn't.
Not on account of me, at least.
Damnant quod non intelligunt'
- You know Latin?
- Yes. Father Andrew taught me.
Never heard of the man.
Your father has, and he doesn't like him at all.
- He took away his house and his pension.
- Must be a priest.
Yes, he is.
- I thought so.
- You'd like him.
We Tudors hate priests.
- Why?
- Because we...
Just because we don't like them,
I suppose.
I don't think that's a very good reason.
I did hear Warwick saying something to Uncle Thomas... that's the Duke of Norfolk... about Father wanting to get a new queen... and the priest not wanting him to.
Father must have won the argument.
Because we had two queens that year... and another new one now, Lady Parr.
But you can't have three mothers.
Neither can you.
I haven't even got one mother.
- She died when I was a baby.
- So did mine.
But anyway, a queen is a prince's mother.
And you say there's been three.
Six.
Six queens?
Then, you'd have six mothers, but you couldn't have six mothers.
I can't figure it out.
Neither can I.
You may have a pear if you like.
A pear? Which is the pear?
- Haven't you ever seen a pear before?
- No, but I've read about them.
- Nice, aren't they?
- Eat it, lad.
Like it?
Crikey.
It tastes so good,
I almost feel like a prince myself.
You certainly don't look like one.
Unless it would be a prince of paupers.
I will be when I get back to Offal Court... and tell them I've been in the palace and talked to you.
The only trouble is they won't believe me.
Why not, pray?
You see, in Offal Court, a prince is... kind of like Saint Nicholas.
You hear about him, but you never see him... because you couldn't expect him to come to see poor people.
The Prince of Offal Court.
It would be amusing to see their faces.
They'll believe you because when you arrive, you shall be wearing my clothes.
- Sword and all.
- Your clothes?
Why not? Clothes make the prince.
Are there any vermin in this?
So few you'll hardly notice them at all,
Your Highness.
You go wash your face. Over there.
Use the towel.
Penny, please. Please give me a penny.
Don't bother me, my lad.
Why, you look like me.
On the contrary, you look like me.
That's what I said, Your Highness.
We look alike.
- Do you know any games, boy?
- Yes, Your Highness, lots of them:
- Duck and drake, robber and constable.
- How do you play that?
It takes three to play it: A robber, somebody to be robbed, and a constable.
You see, I rob you of something, hide it.
Then you tell the constable, and he and you try to find it.
While you're looking for it, I hide.
Then you and he have to find me to make the arrest, just as in real life.
- Good. I like that. We'll play it.
- But we have no constable.
I'll get my dog.
He'll be a marvelous constable.
He can find anybody no matter where they hide.
Wait here. I'll get him.
- There he goes, running for it.
- After him.
If he gets away, you'll sweat for it.
Not so fast, me lad.
- Captain wants to pay his respects to you.
- Are you mad?
Do you want to lose your heads?
How dare you touch me!
Listen to that.
The Prince must have knighted him.
Now for your lesson, you filthy little beggar.
Beggar? Are you insane?
I'm Prince Edward!
Make way for His Royal Highness, the Prince of Pewy.
I'll have your blood for this, and on my own sword.
Come back whenever you like. The Guard prides itself on entertaining royalty.
Why wasn't His Highness prepared for bed last night?
Because, Your Grace, he didn't ring.
Your Highness.
Where's the Prince?
The Prince?
Yes, the Prince.
Where is he?
But, Your Highness, you are the Prince.
Please, milords, I'm not the Prince.
He went out to get a constable.
I mean, his dog.
And he didn't come back.
I'm a beggar boy.
Don't behead me. Say you won't.
This is not the time for jesting,
Your Highness.
Indeed, it isn't, because I'm in a pickle.
It's all so muddled. The Prince will have my head because I have his clothes.
If the King finds out, he'll have me boiled in oil.
The Prince isn't here right now, but I'm sure he'll come back.
Please, Your Highness, discontinue this whimsy at our expense.
That's just it. I'm not your highness.
I'm Tom Canty, a beggar boy, and I wish I were at it now.
I'm afraid His Highness is ill.
Very ill.
- This will be a death blow to His Majesty.
- We mustn't tell him.
Please, Your Highness, get up from your knees.
What would your father say if he saw you?
In here?
He'd say somebody boosted me through a window.
'Tis true. His Majesty is gravely ailing.
That is God's will.
To inform him that his sins are to rule and live after him... in a daft boy, would be murder.
Neither alchemy nor prayer can cheat death of His Majesty's soul much longer.
But England can be cheated of a rightful king... should His Majesty not proclaim his son... and appoint a Lord Protector before his death.
And who might that be?
One who might not forget a favor done now.
What? Treason!
I talked to him last night, and he was sane as a bishop.
I know, Your Majesty. I saw him then, too.
- 'Tis an evil miracle.
- You lie, I tell you!
I would I did, Your Majesty, that you might be spared the proof.
Stop croaking! Fetch the boy!
Mad, they say.
Too much study.
Sane one minute...
Taken complete leave of his senses.
Doesn't even recognize anyone.
Your Majesty.
The King.
I am done for.
Come, my son.
Sit by me.
Let us talk, you and I.
But I'm not me.
I'm Tom Canty, Your Majesty. Sir.
Tom, sir.
Come, lad.
Would you deny that I am your father?
Yes, sire.
I wouldn't dare let anyone think such a thing.
What envenomed irony fate has wrought.
He doesn't know his own father.
But I do, Your Majesty.
A thief he is and was sorely mean to me.
Please, don't behead me.
Please, let me go home.
You've done this, you pedantic fools.
Whipping his mind with Latin and Greek till it's broken its halter and run wild.
Now take him, cure him, amuse him, freshen him.
Teach him the good English oaths of the hunting field.
Oaths that a man may use in ruling a country.
Not the foreign prattle of priests and scholars!
It shan't be long before you'll know me, little Edward.
Please, Your Majesty.
I'm not Edward. I'm Tom.
These aren't even my clothes.
I'm a beggar boy.
They won't believe me.
Please tell them I'm not your little boy.
This, milords... is my son... who shall sit on the throne and rule.
If not by reason of his wit... then by reason of the name of Tudor.
Summon the entire court to the Throne Room.
And bid them... hurry.
Milords and ladies.
In the past... you have jealously kept my bounty to yourselves.
But soon you'll be sharing it with the worms.
And what is left will probably rattle... in the posits of time.
England... could not shed enough tears to cleanse the name of Henry.
But I promise you... neither can England shed enough blood... to wash the name of Tudor from the roll of kings.
Don't deceive yourselves.
I am not threatening you from the grave.
My power will be buried with my body... and disintegrate as soon.
I'm threatening you with your own weakness... which I've nurtured for years.
Feeding one's greed with another's deceit.
Tolerating treachery.
Until, milords and ladies, you've grown so corrupt... that each could only conceal his guilt in the shadow of the others.
Hence, your heads remain on your shoulders... only as long as a Tudor sits on the throne... to cloak your infamies from the people... behind the purple robes of royalty.
The old dog dies... and the lice daren't desert his pup... lest they starve!
It is my will... that my son, Edward... shall succeed me to the throne.
And that his tutelage and counsel... be entrusted... to a Lord...
High... to a Lord...
High Protector.
And that he... be...
Your Majesty.
The Protector is to be who?
Who?
And now... to face them... all.
The King is dead.
Long live the King.
Let us pray.
The body which was Henry's... will once again become with the earth from which it was molded.
The soul we relegate to God.
The reign, to his royal Majesty, Edward VI.
Can I go home now, please?
Permit me, Your Majesty.
Repeat after me, and when you have finished... strike my shoulder with your sword.
- Aren't your afraid it will cut you?
- With the flat of it, Your Majesty.
Repeat: Let it be known to all my subjects...
"Let it be known to all my subjects..."
- But I'm not the Prince.
...and throughout my realm...
"And throughout my realm..."
...that I hereby designate the Earl of Hertford...
"That I hereby designate the Earl of Hertford..."
...as my Lord High Protector, to direct... with adult advice, my untried judgment.
"As my Lord High Protector, to direct, with adult advice..."
- My untried judgment.
- "My untried judgment."
Death may have been on Norfolk's side, but a brain was on ours.
But fortunately, an addled one.
I'm honored by your selection,
Your Majesty.
- Did I select you for something?
- Yes, Your Majesty.
Henceforth, it is I, not Norfolk, in whom you will confide and trust.
Who's Norfolk?
You can't recall him? That's a pity.
Such a little time remains to make his acquaintance.
I bid you good day, sire.
Please, my lord.
You said I was to confide in you.
Mayn't I do it now?
Wait outside.
His Majesty has some affairs of state which he wishes to discuss.
Yes, milord.
Now, Edward, what is it?
Please, won't you believe that I'm just me and not the Prince?
You're no longer the Prince, Your Majesty.
You're the King.
I'm Tom Canty, I tell you, and I went to sleep in the palace garden.
His Highness brought me in because...
I imagine he was sorry that the Captain of the Guard bashed me.
And what became of the Prince, pray?
I don't know. That kind of worries me.
People won't believe him, either, because he was wearing my clothes... and didn't look at all like a prince.
He looked so much like me, that it made us laugh.
I suppose it wasn't so very funny, though.
You don't believe me?
I believe that you've been studying too hard, Your Majesty.
You won't even ask the Captain about what I said?
If you wish it.
I do, because if he doesn't say the same thing... then I must be out of my wits.
What did the boy look like?
Just another street urchin, milord.
The size and age of His Majesty.
Are you sure it wasn't His Majesty?
Of course. This boy was dirty, in tatters.
Then he was the King.
I don't know.
He said he was, and I thought it was impudence.
But he might have been?
He might have been.
There is either a mad prince or a beggar boy on the throne.
Now, I must know which.
That will be easy to tell, milord.
I pray the crime won't be on my head.
- How?
- His dog.
The brute will not suffer anyone to touch him except His Majesty.
Milord, should it not be, use your influence in my defense.
If you can only save me for the present...
If I save you, Captain, it shan't be for the present... but for the future, in which I may find you useful.
I've brought you a playmate, Edward.
- A dog. Mine?
- Yours.
He didn't like me.
No, my little Potentate of Poverty, he didn't like you.
- Then, you know who I am?
- Yes.
- When can I go?
- Never.
Never?
- But, if I'm not the King...
- You are the King.
The only way to lose the crown now is to lose your head with it.
- But I told the truth.
- And committed treason.
Do you know what that means?
You don't want that pretty little head of yours chopped off, do you?
Nor to have your mother see the crows tearing tufts... from a skull on London Bridge... and know that it's her son's hair in which they will nest?
Then never forget that you are Edward VI of England.
And that to ever again become Tom Canty... is to die.
Yes, sir.
- Your men will miss you, Captain.
- No.
I'm sending you away to execute a little mission for both of us.
Yes, milord?
It seems you expelled a king.
Then it was he.
Your syntax is poor, Captain.
"Was" is in the past tense.
It is he.
When he returns, he'll have my blood.
I remember that threat.
And should he return...
Norfolk would be appointed
Lord High Protector in my stead.
- I cannot defend you from a dungeon.
- What's to be done?
Our difficulties would be resolved by His Majesty's permanent absence.
But, milord... that would be murder.
His life or yours, Captain.
He'll be fairly easy to locate.
Your leave starts tonight.
The passing bell.
In good faith, they toll for Henry... little knowing they're sounding the knell of the House of Tudor.
Let us kneel to ask comfort and solace from Almighty God... when the burden of sorrow is upon us, my people.
Comfort us, O Lord... for we are as a child without a father... or as a ship without a rudder, or as a body without a head.
We mourn him whose statesmanship... and wisdom in counsel... have been as a bulwark against the enemies of England.
Thy will, not ours, be done, O Lord.
But strengthen us in this, our time of grief.
Thy people's sorrow and their destiny perish... for Henry, our King, is dead.
And a child sits upon the throne of England.
Imbue him with thy wisdom... thy strength, and thy mercy, O Lord.
Amen.
Father.
Long live the King.
All I hopes is this King ain't... the drunken fool the last was.
What was that scurrilous remark you made about my father?
You deny that you insulted the late King, my father?
Get away, or I'll fetch you one on the side of the head.
I'll have you drawn and quartered for this.
Do you realize you're addressing your King?
The King, are you? Look what's the King.
This ha'penny worth of cat's meat is none other than His Majesty.
Ho there! Lay off!
Didn't you hear me? I said lay off the lad.
Do you know what happens when you stick your nose where it ain't wanted?
Yes, this.
Back, my good people.
- Why don't we consider this situation?
- You'll all rot in chains for this.
Make way for the King's messenger!
Time for us to leave, I think.
- Where does Your Majesty deign to reside?
- In the palace, of course.
- Charboy?
- King.
Let's not play that game anymore.
It's too strenuous.
You dare disclaim me?
No, Your Majesty, only... it'll be a lot easier if you could be something a trifle more sedentary.
Like the Archbishop of Canterbury.
I tell you I am the King.
As you'll learn much to your regret if you don't keep a civil tone.
Very good, sire.
You're a bit done in after that joust.
You need some sleep to straighten you out.
You're too familiar, my man.
I will honor your hospitality tonight.
In the morning, you shall return to the palace with me for your reward.
Thank you, sire.
A drear hovel.
Yes, but then Windsor is so drafty.
I'm hungry.
What have you to tempt my appetite?
That depends on what didn't tempt the mices.
- Mice?
- Yes. I had to fatten them all up.
You see, the cat threatened to leave.
You're making a joke.
The humor of being short of rations, my friend, has always escaped me.
Then, you're poor?
Would you believe it? I am.
Who are you, fellow?
Miles Hendon, Your Majesty.
The name is not familiar.
What is your trade?
- Soldiering, sire.
- In my service?
In the service of anyone who can afford enemies.
Soldier of fortune. Strange profession.
Of the three open to a gentleman without means, it's the most amusing.
Cheating at cards means associating with dull people.
Preaching the gospel means wearing funny hats.
- Better eat, lad.
- Lad?
I beg your pardon, Your Majesty.
I hope you don't think this is a leg of mutton.
A sheep walked around on it for some time under that impression.
Would you sit in the presence of your King?
- See here...
- I will no longer tolerate your manner.
I ask your pardon, Your Majesty.
But after that chase we led them, it would be good to sit down.
Perhaps.
No, custom must be preserved.
You will stand.
I was very hungry.
- I feel better now.
- I'm gratified, Your Majesty.
Come to think of it,
I'm under obligation to you in many ways.
- Your service demands rich reward.
- A mere nothing, Your Majesty.
You may have any reward you wish.
Name it.
The privilege of sitting in your Majesty's presence.
Advance, fellow, and give me your sword.
- Is it that you find the mutton tough, sire?
- Kneel.
While England remains and the Crown continues... you and your heirs forever may sit in the presence of the Majesty of England.
Arise, Sir Miles Hendon.
For pity's sake, sit down.
Thank you, Your Majesty.
Beginning to ache from the hammering they gave you?
Why do you ask?
You seem to be batting away at a few tears.
I'm not the man to snivel at a few bruises.
In fact, we Tudors never cry.
- What's the matter?
- My dad's dead.
Good morning, Your Majesty.
I hope Your Majesty slept well.
Yes, sir.
- Playing follow-the-leader?
- No, sire. We've come to dress you.
Have I enough clothes to go around?
Indeed, sire, everything has been assigned.
Are you ready to perform your ablutions?
His Majesty's towel and bowl.
His Grace the Lord High Protector, awaits your pleasure... and asks that you be informed that a note on the treasury has to be signed.
The household account being depleted.
- There's no money to pay for the palace?
- No, Your Majesty.
I suppose we'll just have to move to a smaller house.
I remember quite a nice one right next to the fish market in Billingsgate.
The rose water, milord.
It has a nice flavor.
Please, sir, how much longer must I do this?
This is the last, sire.
"Authorizes an increased tax on windows."
Do you mean to say we have a tax on windows?
May I suggest that Your Majesty cease troubling himself about...
I'm head of the government. It's my job to be troubled about these things.
And I think a tax on windows is cruel, unjust.
The royal treasury is empty, sire.
Every means of replenishing it must be taken.
Yes, but windows?
When poor people are sick, windows are the only outside they have.
They wouldn't have anything nice to look at if it weren't for windows.
And besides, that's taxing sunshine and light... which don't belong to us at all, but to God.
His Majesty's made a point there.
We will discuss this privately at some later time.
Have we Your Majesty's permission to withdraw?
Yes.
I'll try to think of some better way to raise money.
Did you see an urchin slide out of here?
He left, but sliding wasn't the way he done it.
He says to me,
"Out of my way, fellow," and stalked.
- Where'd he go?
- Good morning, Pam.
- How are the little ones?
- Where did he go?
It wasn't a he, it was a they.
A slimy looking fella come after the lad.
I heard him telling him you'd sent for him.
- I thought it was a bit fishy, but...
- Cut it short. Which way did he go?
Across the street and to the Thieves Booth, and got dragged off.
By whom?
By a foul old croak with a face that looked as if... it had been suckled on the handle of an headman's ax.
- Never mind the face.
- I didn't. I daresay he did.
He sold a candlestick to the receiver.
- I saw him.
- Who sold a candlestick?
The bloke with the face.
- Good day to you, sir.
- The good sir is looking for a bargain?
Yes, I have a skin I'd like to trade in exchange for a little information.
- A skin? Ermine or sable?
- Neither.
- Rodent.
- A rat skin isn't worth anything.
No? Except to the rat, of course.
You see, the skin happens to be yours.
If you want to save it, tell me who that man was...
- who dragged off the beggar boy.
- What man?
The man from whom you bought the candlestick.
- I don't know.
- No? Too bad.
Wait! Mercy.
I daren't tell you. He'd have every thief in London out to slit my throat.
Then I'll save him some trouble.
I'll tell you.
His name is John Canty.
He lives in Offal Court.
The boy is his son, Tom, a little daft on the subject of royalty.
A thousand thanks, sir. Good day, sir.
You must know I'm not Tom because you couldn't be this mean to your own boy!
You dare strike me?
Smash your own father, will you?
I'll show you!
What's the meaning of this?
I'm his father, and you don't happen to be mine.
So keep your holy nose out of it.
- Lf you strike that boy again, I'II...
- You'll do what?
I'll forget that the laying on of hands should be done gently.
I warned you, you meddling old fool!
- Is he dead?
- Shut up.
Come on!
He just sits there and says nothing.
The boy's potty.
And it's because of that Father Andrew always teaching him...
Be quiet about Father Andrew, can't you?
- Were you seen doing anything?
- Shut up.
- What's the pack?
- Father Andrew.
- What about him?
- Dead as a salted herring.
And it's gossip you done him in.
How do you suppose that got about?
From you bashing him over the head and him not getting up again.
You best take to the road.
Blowing hot, is it?
It'll be scorching your heels soon if you don't make to the Roost.
I'm on the run to see the Ruffler.
Don't open your mouth to no one who ain't in on the know.
- We'll head to the river dike.
- Ain't you taking him?
- What for?
- He seen it, didn't he?
That's right, he did.
He'd be a hindrance, but it's better than having him a witness.
He might come in handy, too.
He's the size that can be lifted through a window easy and quiet.
That's right.
It's time I was breaking him for a retriever.
Come here!
If you see such a beggar boy, you'll get five pounds.
Five pounds for a beggar boy?
What'd he do?
Steal the Throne Room out of Windsor?
Another of His Majesty's whims.
He's a bit addlepated, you know.
Remember, look sharp.
Sharp, at five pounds!
A glance from me will nail him to the wall.
Is John about?
I have a bit of business with him.
It wouldn't have to do with the law, would it?
It might have if I don't see him.
You see, he and I...
Just who are you?
His mother.
And for all the drink it gets me,
I might better have begat an empty bottle.
Well, then... perhaps you can use his share of a candlestick we lifted together.
This is once I get my share.
I'm beholden to you, indeed.
Not at all. Where can I find John?
Him and that crazed brat of his had to take to the road.
- Making for the Roost, they are.
- The Roost?
An empty barn near Stullington.
They all holes up there with the Ruffler when it gets hot for 'em.
Yes, of course. The Ruffler.
You say his son is a little unhinged?
Like a gate, he is. Thinks he's a king.
- Has he been this way long?
- No.
John fetched him home like that just today.
Probably gave him one over the head... and cracked it like a nut.
I need money to maintain the palaces, courts, and royal establishments... that His Majesty's dignity be upheld.
May I remark, milord, that it might be more important... to uphold the dignity of England upon the sea?
Let me remind you,
England still has ships afloat.
Barely afloat.
Some of them we daren't fire a cannon aboard for fear of opening up seams.
With the thousands of pounds you've spent on one stable at Windsor... we could've increased the fleet by one-fourth.
You will observe, my lords... how amusingly futile is the bark of an old sea dog... when his teeth have been pulled.
Am I to understand, then, that the Navy is to get nothing?
And that you intend to wheedle a demented boy... into signing these looting demands on the treasury?
That is my intention.
Following the dictates of my judgment and honor.
You admit to honor?
- I boast of it.
- Excellent.
Then you have no alternative but to defend it.
It does not please me to be awakened yet.
You'll wake up, beggar, and pay heed.
- Am I not King anymore?
- Certainly, my most gracious liege.
Good. I'm getting so I kind of enjoy it.
Send for the Lord of the Chamber.
I want something to eat.
- Sign this order.
- What is it?
Sign it.
- Have you seen the Great Seal?
- Great Seal? No.
The great big ones are called walruses.
Stamp, you little fool! A big stamp!
No, I didn't see it. Did you lose it?
The Prince hid it.
When you find the Prince, maybe he'll remember.
- You are looking for him, aren't you?
- Yes, we're looking for him.
"It's our will that Thomas Howard, second Duke of Norfolk...
"steward of the Household, and Lord High Admiral of the fleet...
"be placed under arrest, incarcerated in the Tower...
"and there held for execution for his treasonous plottings...
"against the Crown and the public weal."
Signed Edward Rex.
May I see it?
This order is signed by His Majesty... but not stamped with the Great Seal.
You cannot execute me.
True, but we can keep you in prison... until the Great Seal, which has been mislaid, is found.
And I assure Your Grace, that will be shortly.
You've chosen an excellent way to avoid meeting me in a duel.
A way worthy of you, Hertford.
We await your attendance, milord.
Poor little boy.
Bereft of reason and made the pawn of an unscrupulous scoundrel.
May history learn the truth and forgive Edward.
That song reminds me of Molly One-Eye.
It was her favorite.
What happened to old Molly One-Eye?
Died of honesty, she did.
Tried to turn a penny by telling fortunes... and swiftly, they burned her for a witch.
And a merry blaze she made... with her marrow all soaked in spirits.
Her mistake was in changing her trade.
No, her mistake was being born in England.
Here! No treason, now.
What's wrong with England?
- Her laws.
- What do you know about English law?
Think you're a magistrate?
No.
A human being for whom they're made.
An honest farmer... who had self-respect, a wife, three children, a mother.
All of which have been legislated into potter's field by English law.
Our first sin was committed by my mother... when she went to nurse her sick neighbor.
When the woman died, the doctors couldn't find the cause.
So they solved it... by calling my mother a witch and boiling her in oil... while I and my babes looked on... and learned the meaning of English justice.
We begged from house to house.
I, with two children stumbling and whimpering on either end.
Finally, I stole.
To keep my little Joseph from starving.
But English law decreed otherwise.
I was caught, sold for a slave... and branded on the cheek with the letter "S".
"S" for slave!
An English slave.
Understand? An English slave.
The most contemptuous title any Englishman can bear... still conferred by English law.
But I'll be relieved of it.
One day I'll be caught and hanged.
You shall not!
Furthermore, on this day, that law is ended.
What's that?
Who is this?
I am Edward, King of England.
You mannerless vagrants.
Is this the thanks I get for the royal boon I have promised?
He's my son and stark mad.
Thinks he's King.
I am the King.
As you, a confessed murderer, shall soon learn on the gallows!
You'd try your own father, will you?
If you have no respect for your king, have some for the Ruffler... or I'll teach you respect at the end of a rope.
Now, lad, if you must be king... humor yourself, but not as King of England.
It's treason, and we'll have none of that here.
We may be a scurvy lot... but at least we're scurvy Englishmen, and loyal to the Crown.
God bless Edward, King of England!
I thank you, my good people.
Drop it, I said.
Choose yourself another handle.
- Foo-Foo the First!
- King of mooncalves!
Here you are! Your robe, sire!
- A crown!
- Here's one.
He's disappeared, plain and simple.
Why should His Grace still be worried about him?
Because it would put England in revolt and half its head on the chopping block... should there be two Edwards at the coronation tomorrow.
What's that to us? We're still the King's Guard, whether the King is...
Edward or Bobo the butcher boy.
One o'clock and all's well!
Drink up and be off to your rooms.
It's closing time. Come on.
That's good advice.
You'll be on the road at sunrise. Up!
Right, sir.
About three more swallows will do it.
Take your time, sir.
I wouldn't want you to get the hiccups.
No. They're noisy things.
Here's to the end of your long day.
It'd be a pleasure to get you another, sir.
Would it? But how about your sleep?
I can manage to keep my eyes open.
Especially when there's something handsome to look at.
Are you staying the night?
- No. Worse luck.
- Why not?
- The curse of money, my dear.
- You mean you're strapped?
I only wish I were.
Then I couldn't have flipped that coin.
- But where are you going?
- A place called the Roost, near here.
That thieves' den?
But you're not going there at this time of night?
You'll have your throat cut sure.
They'll commit murder for a penny.
It looks bad for me with my shilling.
Remember, if you don't do like you've been told... we'll put climes on you.
Twenty of them.
You know what climes are?
Tell him, Hugo.
They're little bandages with a bit of paste on them... made of soap and quicklime and rust off old iron.
And when you take some off, there's the nastiest looking sore... that ever made a citizen sick.
Sores that don't get well, but spread like a disease.
No.
I'll steal.
Let's get at it, then.
Help! Murder! Call the watch!
Stop!
Where'd they go?
Help!
Who was that?
Murder!
Boy, stop. It is I, Miles Hendon.
What happened there?
- I've been murdered.
- Murdered?
They killed me.
- All right, what happened?
- I don't know.
You don't know? I have a pretty fair idea.
You got into the room and didn't do what you was told.
Now you'll get what's coming to you.
I'm deeply grateful to you, Sir Miles.
You certainly make some delightful acquaintances.
Is he dead?
I don't anticipate hearing an apology from him much before Judgment Day.
It is just. He was a confessed murderer.
Come. I wish to be gone from here.
What have you been doing since I last saw you?
Learning a great deal about England.
- It doesn't seem to please you.
- No, it doesn't.
- Hold or I'll fire!
- That's them.
No doubt! What are they doing about this time of night?
String 'em both up.
- Stop that! What would you with us?
- You're under arrest for robbery.
We know nothing of any robbery.
We'll take you back to the Running Fox.
We'll find out soon enough.
- They're the thieves, all right.
- No doubt of it.
All right, here they are. We nabbed them.
No, sir. It wasn't this gentleman, sir.
I happen to know it was otherwise...
You speak when you're spoke to.
If you can recognize them... they'll soon be on their way to learn it's harder to break out than in.
I can recognize them. Just point them out.
Get over there.
I can identify him.
He was the one with the musket.
No, sir. I was the one that led the cavalry charge. Don't you remember?
My dapper friend, you'd be more respectful lashed to a whipping post.
You, my fat friend, would look more natural tied to a hitching post.
- Where are all the others?
- All the others is him.
He's right here, sir.
It's him.
His Majesty.
- Get the horses ready.
- Right, sir.
- It's he. I'm positive.
- Take your hands from me, pig!
- Pig? I'll teach you.
- What?
- You're a pretty pair of cutthroats.
- Take them away.
One moment.
- We'll take charge of the boy.
- Captain, l...
And who might you be to be taking charge of my prisoner?
The Captain of His Majesty's Guard.
Let's see that.
The boy has escaped from a London madhouse.
And has a strange insanity offensive to the Crown.
Naturally, this is our responsibility.
Yes, sir. Of course, sir. Your prisoner, sir.
Take him along.
- Glad to have been of service, Captain.
- Good night.
Captain, what do you suggest doing with this one, sir?
He seems capable of digesting about 20 lashes.
Thank you, Captain.
When next we meet, I trust you'll be capable of digesting 20 inches of steel.
Here.
How dare you indulge this outrage on my person?
It wouldn't do to let people know there's been no king on the throne... until the day before the coronation.
Forgive me. It was the best ruse I knew to get you away.
But what of the man Hendon?
I want him freed.
He shall be in the morning.
Tonight we get closer to London to arrive in time tomorrow.
Very well.
But should any harm come to Miles Hendon, your life shall pay for it.
- Understand?
- Yes, Your Majesty. My life.
- Why are we stopping here, Captain?
- To let you get some sleep, Your Majesty.
I felt my making camp for a few hours... would freshen you for the coronation ceremonies in the morning.
Very considerate, Captain. I am sleepy.
This way, Your Majesty.
This place will be ideal.
May I have your cloak, Captain?
Give me your cloak.
- Forgive me, Your Majesty.
- What have you done?
It's what I must do, poor little Edward.
Is that any way to address your King?
Or for the Captain of my Guard to act?
Cowering like a woman?
Out with it, fellow. What is it?
You are to join your father, Your Majesty.
You're going to kill me?
You can't.
You just can't.
There's no one to take the throne, except Mary or Elizabeth.
And they're girls and not even grown up.
Say your prayers, Your Majesty.
I hope my father's asleep in heaven.
I don't want him to know that a Tudor died at the hands of a traitorous Englishman.
He'd be so ashamed of you.
But he won't be ashamed of me.
"Our father, who art in heaven...
"hallowed be thy name.
"Thy kingdom come...
"thy will be done...
"on earth as it is in heaven."
And me what calls myself an Englishman.
Be still, can't you?
"Forgive us our trespasses...
"as we forgive those who trespass against us.
"Lead us not into temptation...
"but deliver us from evil."
How's your digestion now, Captain?
Ready for that 20 inches of steel
I promised you?
Miles Hendon!
- Your Majesty.
- Majesty?
- Then you believe me?
- Without a doubt, sire.
What's the matter?
I was frightened.
Sirs, here I present King Edward... rightful and undoubted inheritor by the laws of God and man... to the royal dignity and crown imperial of this realm... whose consecration, inunction, and coronation... is appointed to be this day.
Will ye nobles, peers, and commons serve at this time... and give your good wills in a sense... to the same consecration, inunction, and coronation... as by your duty ye are bound to do?
Yes!
Smile, you little fool.
Smile and bow to them.
O God, who dwellest in the high and holy place... with them also who are of a humble spirit...
Look down mercifully upon this, thy servant Edward, our King... here humbling himself before thee at thy footstool... and graciously receive these oblations... which in humble acknowledgment of thy sovereignty over all... and of thy great bounty to him in particular... he hath offered up unto thee... through Jesus Christ, our only mediator and advocate.
Amen.
Will you, Edward, grant to the people of England... the laws and liberties of this realm?
"I do grant and so promise."
Will you keep to the Church and people holy peace and concord?
"I shall keep."
Will you make to be done to the best of your strength and power... equal and rightful justice in all your dooms and judgments with mercy and truth?
"I shall do."
The things which I have here before promised I will perform and keep.
So help me God and the contents of this book.
Kiss the book.
Let these hands be anointed with holy oil.
Let this breast... be anointed with holy oil.
And let this head be anointed with holy oil.
As kings and prophets were anointed... and as Samuel did anoint David to be king.
So that thou mayest be blessed and established... a king in this kingdom, over this people... whom the Lord thy God have given thee to rule and govern.
Amen.
O Lord... who receivest thy good and faithful servants... with mercy and loving kindness...
Look down upon this, thy servant Edward, our King...
- Get out of here.
- Look here, my good fellow...
Something of the utmost importance to the entire realm has arisen...
You'll have your ears taken off if you don't go.
- I demand to speak to your captain.
- He'll give you 40 lashes.
...having a right faith and manifold fruit of good works... mayest obtain the crown of an everlasting Kingdom.
Stop!
What is this?
What is he doing?
Stop! I forbid it.
Who dares this sacrilege?
I, Edward, the King.
Truly, he is the King.
His Majesty's malady is upon him again.
- Seize the impostor.
- Hold!
O my lord and King, forgive me.
What you have done is shameful treason.
It wasn't my doing, Your Majesty.
Cross my heart.
I believe you, Tom Canty.
But others shall answer.
- Outrage...
- Softly.
Your Majesty, perhaps we could proceed with the coronation... if you were assured no harm would come to this lad.
What a striking resemblance.
Some of you have already forfeited your heads.
But others may be spared by paying homage now.
Please, milord. Please believe us.
Truly, he is the King.
By your favor, sire, might I ask some questions... which may allay our doubts?
I command you to do so, that I may answer them... and end your stupid perplexity.
What stands near the right-hand door of our late King's apartment?
The Great Herring.
A model of the warship designed by my late father.
God rest his soul.
Of what did Lady Jane eat so many that she became...
- discommoded?
- Pomegranates.
And got ill on the Steward of the Household.
Which man did you wrongly but affectionately call uncle?
Milord Norfolk, whose absence displeases me.
- All these things are true, milord.
- Unbelievably.
Astonishing.
Quite astonishing indeed, but the King can do the same. They are not proofs.
It is perilous to the state and to us all, to entertain such a mystery as this.
It could undermine the throne, divide the nation.
- Arrest this...
- One moment.
The mystery may be easily solved.
There's one question which only the Prince of Wales can answer.
- Where is the Great Seal of England?
- That'll settle it.
I must have put it with all things of value which had been entrusted to me.
Of course. Milord St. John... go to my private cabinet.
Close to the floor in the left corner is a nailhead.
Press it and a jeweled closet will fly open.
There you will find the Great Seal. Fetch it.
- At once!
- And do hurry.
Yes, Your Majesty.
- Your mount, Captain!
- Yes, milord.
The seal, Your Majesty, is not there.
Cast this beggar into the streets.
Stone the impostor. Take him away.
Let him alone!
Please, sir. Maybe His Majesty has just misplaced the seal.
- He might have, mightn't he?
- Hardly likely, sire.
A massive golden disk isn't a thing to escape notice.
Was it round and thick?
And did it have letters carved in it?
That would describe it, my liege.
Blimey. So that's the thing that's been worrying everybody.
If you'd described it to me, you could have had it sooner.
Your Majesty, knowing where the great seal lies... does nothing to establish this lad's spurious claim.
Perhaps we'd better continue the ceremony.
But with the real King, because he put away the seal himself.
Remember, Your Majesty?
You must. You've got to be king.
Because I wouldn't like it anymore.
Think.
I just can't.
- It seems so long ago.
- We exchanged clothes, you remember?
That I'll never forget.
And you asked me if I knew any games, and I said, Constable.
And you went out to get your dog.
But before you left, what did you do?
Think.
- Harder, Your Majesty.
- I just can't.
Listen, and try and see it.
You started for the door.
You passed a table.
That old thing you called a seal was on it.
You picked it up and looked about for some place to hide it.
Your eyes caught sight of...
The suit of armor by the door, in the leg-piece.
Your Majesty. Coming through.
- Your mount again, Captain?
- Yes, sir.
He's a busy bloke, ain't he?
Come here, lad.
Yes, Your Majesty?
I owe my throne to you, Tom.
A debt which I shall pay.
But tell me, how could you remember where I hid the seal... when I couldn't myself?
You see, Your Majesty,
I found it and used it.
Used it? For what?
To crack nuts with.
My father told me the night he died... that a wise king removes the heads of those... who try to remove the crown.
But I suppose I'm not a wise king.
Because I don't want you to be killed.
Instead, I hereby order you to be banished from England... for the rest of your life.
May I learn generosity from you, sire.
The acts, Your Majesty.
Milords and ladies, my dad...
I mean, the late King... told me to use the Great Seal sparingly in making laws.
But if he had gone out among his people without his crown...
I know he'd have told me not to spare it in breaking them.
So these acts abolish the begging laws... modify the laws of eminent domain, and do away with slavery.
Churl, you dare sit in the presence of your King?
Yes. But you mustn't.
- Your Majesty!
- Let's not take affront.
It is his right, afforded by a grateful King, whose life he saved.
- Also, Sir Miles Hendon...
- Yes, sire?
There is among these papers a commission for you.
- As Captain of my Guard.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
You aren't pleased by my appointment?
You see, Your Majesty, the enemy will never come to Windsor.
And a Captain of the Guard can't go looking for them.
So, as my trade's soldiering, I don't see when I'll get a chance to practice it.
Very well.
- But I owe you something.
- Three crowns to be exact, sire.
You shall have them. A hundredfold.
Yes, and an earldom, castles, lands...
- and a retinue of servants.
- Your Majesty.
I hope Your Majesty won't think me ungrateful... but please may I be permitted to forgo all these honors... with which Your Majesty threatens me?
To one of my temperament, riches are a curse.
Possessions, a veritable scourge.
All I ask is an obscure life and a peaceful one.
But not too peaceful, of course.
Anything to content you, Sir Miles.
But remember, I'm eternally in your debt.
I'll seal these, and you may send for them later.
- Please dismiss the court.
- Yes, sire.
You have His Majesty's permission to withdraw.
- Tom.
- Yes, Your Highness?
- Come here.
- Yes, sire.
They're gone.
Sit down.
Are you sure it's all right?
You sat down all the time you were King, so I suppose it won't matter now.
- This one's about you.
- Me?
- It makes you my ward.
- Ward?
That means all your life you'll have money to live on.
And if anybody's unkind or cruel to you... they've committed an offense against the Crown.
- Oh, Your Majesty.
- What's the matter?
- I just don't know what to say.
- Just say thank you.
This is good for cracking nuts, isn't it?

Conway!
We can't take more than seven.
All right. I'm sorry.
Another plane in a minute.
All right.
Wait, everybody.
Plenty of planes are coming.
Have patience, we'll be all right.
- It won't be long!
- Don't worry.
Leave everything to my brother.
- Yes, sir, 10 passengers aboard.
-10 passengers. Good.
Say, get me Shanghai.
- Is Colonel Marsh there?
- Right here, Conway. Go ahead.
I need more planes.
I've still about 30 people to get out.
- Where are the planes you promised?
- We sent all we could find.
They better get here, or I can't be responsible...
- I think I hear motors.
- Wait a minute, they may be here now.
George, get down on the field and guide those planes in.
Be sure none of the natives get in.
- Hello, Colonel?
- Hello, Conway.
- Thanks, and take care of your liver.
- My word!
Get ready, everyone. Planes are here.
One at a time. Children first.
Where are they? Come stand over here.
Where's the mother?
- They're orphans.
- I see. You come here, and you...
- What about us, Mr. Conway?
- Wait your turn. Come on, you.
Take some of those squealing men with you first.
They might faint on you. I'll wait.
Just as you say. You, madam.
Come through here. Wait on one side.
- Don't lose your heads!
- What was that explosion?
They've blown up the powerhouse!
The planes can't land without lights.
We'll burn the hangar.
That will make light for them.
There's going to be a big fire.
All right. Go ahead!
We go on the next plane.
Bring out any people that are left.
- Hello, Fenner.
- Hello, Conway. Having a little trouble?
Never mind me.
Get this gadget off the ground.
- Bob, these are all that are left.
- Quick.
You can't leave me here, you blighter!
I'm a British subject.
Look out, Bob!
All right, Fenner. Go ahead!
Down on the floor!
Go ahead, Fenner!
Let's go!
I guess we're out of range.
- Everybody all right?
- That was close.
I've never been in a situation like this in my life.
- Where do you come from?
- I'm Alexander P. Lovett.
- Why aren't you registered?
- It'd serve you right to be left behind.
How could I know a war was going to break out over my head?
Right over my head. My word!
Those Chinese were pouncing on me.
I had to get into these ridiculous clothes in order to escape.
- Where were you hiding?
- Hiding? No.
Hunting. I was in the interior hunting fossils.
- This morning I looked up suddenly...
- And a war broke out right over your head!
Next time you're in wild country like this, keep in touch with the British consul.
Very good, Freshie.
Put his name on the list and make out a report later.
I beg your pardon, brother.
- What did you say you were hunting?
- Fossils.
- Fossils?
- I'm a palaeontologist.
- A what?
- A palaeontologist.
I see.
I have here a discovery that will startle the world.
It's the vertebra from the lumbar of a Megatherium, found in Asia.
- What do you know about that?
- Found in Asia.
When I get home,
I'll probably be knighted for it.
You don't say!
- Do you mind if I take a look at it?
- Not at all.
Sorry.
This is the only thing I was able to save when those heathens surrounded me.
From this vertebra,
I'll be able to reconstruct...
...the entire skeleton...
You expect to be knighted for finding that soup bone?
This is the vertebra of a Megatherium found in Asia.
I remember. You said that before.
Sir Henry Derwent was knighted.
He never got beyond the Mesozoic era.
- Poor fellow!
- Yes, it just shows...
I don't know why I'm talking to you.
Who are you?
- Okay, brother.
- Don't call me "brother. "
Okay, sister.
No offence.
Cigarette?
- I say, will you have a cigarette?
- No.
You're an American, aren't you?
Go and annoy the rest of your playmates.
Let me alone.
Look what I found.
Just what I needed, too.
You.
Just this once, Bob. I feel like celebrating.
Think of it. A cruiser sent to Shanghai just to take you back to England.
You know what it means? Here you are.
Don't bother about those cables now.
I want you to drink with me.
Gentlemen, I give you Robert Conway,
England's new Foreign Secretary.
Hooray!
How I'm going to bask in reflected glory.
People will point to me and say:
"There goes George Conway, brother of the Foreign Secretary. "
- Don't talk nonsense. Give me the bottle.
- That's why they're sending for you.
With all these foreign entanglements, it was bound to happen.
You can laugh if you want to.
But whom else can they get?
Who else in England is half the fighter and half the diplomat...
...who has half your knowledge of the foreign situation?
They can't stop you now.
Hello, Freshie.
- Did you make that report out yet?
- Yes, Bob.
- Did you say we saved 90 white people?
- Yes.
Hooray for us.
Did you say that we left 10,000 natives down there to be annihilated?
No, you wouldn't say that.
They don't count.
You'd better try to get some sleep.
Just you wait until I'm foreign secretary.
Can't you just see me with all those other shrewd little foreign secretaries?
The trick is to see who can outtalk the other.
Everybody wants something for nothing.
If you can't get it with smooth talk, you send your army in.
I'm going to fool them.
I'm not going to have an army.
I am going to disband mine.
I'm going to sink my battleships.
I'm going to destroy every piece of warcraft.
When the enemy approaches, we'll say:
"Come in, gentlemen.
What can we do for you?"
So then the poor enemy soldiers will stop and think.
And what will they think?
They'll say, "Something's wrong here, we've been duped!
"This is not according to form.
"These people seem quite friendly.
Why should we shoot them?"
Then they'll lay down their arms.
You see how simple the whole thing is?
Centuries of tradition kicked right in the pants.
And I'll be slapped straight into the nearest insane asylum.
You'd better not drink anymore.
You're not talking sense.
Don't worry, George, nothing's going to happen.
I'll fall right into line.
I'll be the good little boy that everybody wants me to be.
I'll be the best little foreign secretary we've ever had.
Just because I haven't the nerve to be anything else.
- Do try to sleep, Bob.
- Yes. Good thing, sleep.
Ever notice the sunrise in China?
You should. It's beautiful.
Good morning, Lovey.
- I beg your pardon?
- I say, "Good morning, Lovey. "
Good morning. Look here, young man.
I didn't care for "sister" last night, and I don't like "Lovey" this morning.
- My name is Lovett, Alexander P.
- I see.
- It's a good morning, anyway.
- I'm never conversational before coffee.
Wait a minute.
Is it a good morning?
We're supposed to be travelling east, aren't we?
- Of course.
- It looks to me as if we're travelling west.
- That's ridiculous.
- Is it?
It certainly is.
Any child knows how to tell direction.
I don't care where the child is, in the air, on the earth, or in the sea.
If you face the rising sun, your right hand is north, your left hand is south.
I get it twisted because I'm left-handed.
- Really?
- Yes.
Just reverse it. Your left hand is...
What difference does it make?
The north is the north.
All I know is the sun rises in the east, and we're going away from it.
Now you're irritating and absurd.
Of course. Boy!
We're travelling in the wrong direction.
- We're going in the wrong direction.
- Couldn't you make less noise?
We're going west, and Shanghai is way east of here.
Quiet! Fenner's the best pilot in China.
- It's Fenner.
- He may have lost his way.
That's what I told him.
You can't expect him to sail in the dark.
Calm yourself. I'll speak to Fenner.
Fenner! I say...
- Bob, it isn't Fenner in the cockpit!
- Stop it.
The bloke up there looks Chinese or Mongolian.
We're nowhere near Shanghai.
We're going in the opposite direction.
We're over the desert. That's funny.
Charming chap.
Nice puss to meet in a dark alley.
- That's that.
- I wonder what happened to Fenner.
Who is he? How'd he get there?
Do you think we stopped last night and changed pilots?
That's not possible.
If we'd landed, we would've awakened.
We never left the air.
I didn't sleep the whole night long.
- That fellow got on at Baskul.
- Where's he taking us?
He may be a maniac for all we know.
What are you going to do?
- I'll make him tell us his game.
- What if he refuses?
- We'll smash his face in.
- Brilliant!
Can anyone here fly a plane?
That's no good.
- I guess we're in for it.
- In for what?
I don't know. He must have had some purpose in taking the plane.
- When he lands, we'll find out.
- You won't do anything till we land?
- What do you suggest?
- Why, you...
- He may dash us to pieces.
- It might afford you a great deal of relief.
I am going back to sleep.
I was having such a peaceful dream.
As soon as he lands, let me know.
We're heading down! We're going to land.
We're coming to a village.
- What are these people?
- I don't know. I can't get their dialect.
They're loading up with gasoline.
Imagine having that fuel there, waiting for us!
Something tells me our journey is just beginning.
Where are we going?
If you ask me, we're heading straight for those mountains.
Douglas plane from Baskul with Conway and four others aboard still missing.
Unreported between here and Baskul.
Make it very emphatic that His Majesty's government...
...will hold the Chinese government and all governors of Chinese provinces...
...responsible for the complete safety of Robert Conway.
Good morning, gentlemen.
- No news yet, sir?
- It's fantastic.
The plane couldn't disappear into thin air.
Cable Lord Gainsford at Shanghai.
Leave no stone unturned to find Conway.
- Robertson?
- Yes, sir.
Postpone the Far East conference.
We can't meet those nations...
...without Conway.
This can't be kidnapping.
They wouldn't be taking us so far on such a dangerous trip. No sense to it.
What do you make of it, Bob?
You must have some idea.
I give it up.
Not knowing where you're going is exciting anyway.
Mr. Conway, for a man who's supposed to be a leader...
...your do-nothing attitude is very disappointing.
- What do you want him to do?
- I don't know.
I'm a palaeontologist, not a foreign secretary.
- George, come on.
- It's not knowing that's so awful.
Not knowing where you're going, why, or what's waiting when you get there.
We got above that storm.
I can't stand it any longer! Take us down!
I can't stand the pain any longer.
Let me out of here!
I can't stand it any longer!
Let me out of here!
It's oxygen.
- Take this in your teeth.
- Let me alone.
Come on. That's right. Bite on that.
What's that?
- What's happening?
- He must have run out of fuel.
Look! Look down there!
George! Everybody!
Better get back towards the tail.
He may nose her over. Into the corner!
Quick, George! Cushions! Blankets!
Take that behind you.
- Everybody all right?
- Yeah.
- He's fainted?
- Looks like it. You smell those fumes?
Here, George, take the gun.
Hold the light.
I'll search him before he comes to.
We might find something interesting.
There's a map.
- He's dead.
- Dead?
It must have happened when he hit the ground.
Let's take a look at this map.
What is it?
- See that spot?
- Yes.
That's where we were this morning.
He had it marked.
Right on the border of Tibet.
Here's where civilisation ends.
We must be 1,000 miles beyond it.
Just a blank on the map.
- What does it mean?
- It means we're in unexplored country.
Country nobody ever reached.
Conway! What's happening?
Our chances of getting out of this are slim, but it's up to us.
We can't have three hysterical people on our hands.
- What do you say?
- Everything's all right.
The pilot won't trouble us anymore.
He's dead.
- Dead?
- Probably a heart attack.
What are we going to do?
Nothing until the morning. The storm will probably die down before then.
My suggestion is that we better all try and get a good night's rest.
Why not tell them the truth.
We're a million miles from civilisation...
...without a chance of getting out of here alive?
It's slow starvation.
It's slow horrible death.
That's perfect. Just perfect.
What a kick I'm going to get out of this.
A year ago, a doctor gave me six months to live. That was a year ago.
I'm already six months to the good.
I'm on velvet. I haven't got a thing to lose.
But, you, the noble animals of the human race...
...what a kick I'll get out of watching you squirm for a change.
What a kick!
They've been gone for hours.
Left us here to rot.
That's what they've done.
- Heroes of the newspapers.
- All right. Keep quiet.
Here they come.
Hello, everybody. We found some food.
No chance of starving now.
- What is that?
- Mountain grass. It's good. Have some.
I've read of people lasting 30 days on this stuff.
My brother and I have worked out a plan.
If we use our heads we'll keep alive for weeks, till he gets back.
- Gets back?
- Where's he gone?
He's starting out right away in the direction of India.
Sooner or later, he's bound to run into a tribe or something.
Here's the idea.
We found a cave over that small hill.
As soon as we bury the pilot, we'll move in. We can have a fire.
I shouldn't be surprised to see Bob back within a week.
You haven't a Chinaman's chance of getting out of here alive. You know it.
- Cave? Where?
- Over by that hill.
Hey, look! Look, Bob!
- Where are they? Do you see them?
- Yes.
Do you think they're cannibals?
I am from the nearby lamasery.
My name is Chang.
He's speaking English.
- And mine's Conway.
- How do you do?
You've no idea how unexpected and very welcome you are.
My friends and l, and the lady in the plane...
...left Baskul the night before last for Shanghai.
But we were travelling in the opposite direction.
At the mercy of a mad pilot.
- We'd be eternally grateful if you...
- Where is your "mad" pilot?
He must have had a heart attack, or perhaps the fumes.
When the plane landed he was dead.
We were going to bury him when you came along.
Pardon me.
If you will be good enough to direct us to your lamasery...
It is an honour to accompany you and your friends.
You'll need suitable clothes for the journey.
- It is not particularly far, but quite difficult.
- Thank you.
Welcome to Shangri-La.
You see we are sheltered by mountains on every side.
A strange phenomenon for which we are very grateful.
It's magical.
- I definitely do not like this place.
- Will you quit squawking?
- Look at what they gave me to wear.
- You never looked better.
As soon as our clothes are cleaned, they'll give them back to us, Lovey.
Something tells me this means food.
Come on.
I just feel as though I'm being made ready for the executioner.
If this be execution, lead me to it.
That's what they do with cattle just before the slaughter. Fatten them.
- You're a scream, Lovey.
- Please don't call me "Lovey. "
That was refreshing.
The food looks good.
Some layout they got here.
You see the rooms?
Couldn't do better at the Ritz.
All the conveniences for the condemned.
- Don't mind Lovey. He's got the misery.
- I don't like this place. It's too mysterious.
It's better than freezing to death down below, isn't it?
Is there something I can do for you?
- What do you want?
- I've ordered you some warm broth.
- I thought perhaps...
- Get out of here!
If any of you men think you can come busting in here...
Please.
Please calm yourself.
You'll soon be well if you do.
I don't need any advice from you.
Get me a doctor.
- I'm sorry, we have no doctors here.
- No doctors.
Well, that's just fine.
- Please let me help you.
- You can help me jump over that cliff.
I've been looking at the bottom of that mountain...
...but I haven't got the nerve to jump.
You shouldn't be looking at the bottom of the mountain.
Why don't you try looking up at the top sometime?
Don't preach that cheap, second-hand stuff to me.
Go on, beat it!
Beat it!
Peace be with you, my child.
Good evening, my friends.
Please sit down.
- I hope you found everything satisfactory.
- Swell.
Excellent.
- You shouldn't have waited for me.
- Where's the girl? Miss Stone.
She's remaining in her room.
She isn't feeling very well.
Please go on without me. I eat very little.
There's certainly nothing wrong with that meal.
Thank you.
- And the wine is excellent.
- I'm glad you like it.
It's made right here in the valley.
Now that dinner is over, we're very anxious...
...to discuss ways and means of getting back home.
First, we want to cable the Foreign Office.
England's waiting for news of my brother.
There's a cruiser at Shanghai to take him back.
Really?
As regards cabling, I'm afraid I can't help.
Unfortunately we have no wireless here.
As a matter of fact, we have no means of communication with the outside world.
- Not even a radio?
- It's been a source of deep regret...
...but the mountains surrounding us have made reception almost impossible.
We'd better make arrangements to get some porters immediately.
Some means to get us back to civilisation.
- Are you so certain you are away from it?
- As far away as I ever want to be.
The porters will be very well paid.
That is, within reason.
I'm afraid that wouldn't help.
We have no porters here.
No porters here?
What about those men we met this morning?
Those are our own people.
They never venture beyond where you were met this morning.
It's much too hazardous.
How do you account for all this?
Who brought it in?
There is a tribe of porters some 500 miles from here.
That is our only contact with the outside world.
Every now and again, depending upon favourable weather, they make the journey.
- How can we get in touch with them?
- In that respect you are very fortunate.
We are expecting a shipment from them almost any time now.
What do you mean by "almost any time now"?
We've been expecting this particular shipment for the past two years.
- Two years?
- Yes.
Well...
But I assure you, gentlemen, if there is a prolonged delay...
...Shangri-La will endeavour to make your stay as pleasant as possible.
And now, if you will excuse me, it is getting late.
I do hope you all sleep well.
Good night.
Good night, Mr. Conway.
Good night, sir.
That's what I mean, mysterious.
I don't like that man. He's too vague.
We didn't get much information out of him, did we?
It seems we should be grateful.
We were in a bad mess this morning.
After all, this is quite pleasant.
Why not make ourselves comfortable until the porters do arrive?
That's what I say.
What do you say to a rubber of bridge?
- I saw some cards in the other room.
- Not for me, thanks. I'm too weary.
How about you, Lovey? Come on.
Let's you and I play a game of honeymoon bridge.
- I'm thinking.
- Thinking?
- What about some double solitaire?
- In fact, I'm very good at it.
- No kidding?
- Yes.
Then I'm your man. Come on, Toots.
- Hello, George. Cigarette?
- Thanks.
I suppose all this comes under the heading of adventure.
There's been plenty of it in the last few days.
It's far from over from what I can see.
This place gives me the creeps.
Hidden away like this, no contact with civilisation.
You don't seem concerned at all.
I'm feeling far too peaceful to be concerned about anything.
I think I'm going to like it here.
You talk as if you intend on staying.
Something happened to me when we arrived here that...
Did you ever go to a strange place and feel sure you'd been there before?
- What are you talking about?
- I don't know.
You're a strange bird.
No wonder Gainsford calls you:
"The man who always wanted to see the other side of the hill. "
Do you ever want to see what's on the other side?
What else could there be, except another hill?
In any event, I'm not curious.
It seems to me we should be concerned about getting home.
- I'd give anything to be in London now.
- Of course you would.
If ever we get out of this place, you should take that job with Helen's father.
What do you mean, "lf"?
- Did I say, "lf"?
- That's what you said.
Well, I mean...
You talk as though we're going to have trouble getting out of here.
I've been putting things together.
Do you notice the resemblance between those natives and the pilot?
Why did those clothes materialise so conveniently when they met us?
Chang himself just said that they never venture beyond that point.
What brought them there, unless it was to meet us?
Chang's first question was about the pilot.
There must be some connection between the plane and this place.
They must have deliberately brought us here.
What reason could they have for doing a thing like that?
That's what's on the other side of the hill.
It's 3,000 feet practically straight down to the floor of the valley.
The Valley of the Blue Moon, as we call it.
There are over 2,000 people in the valley besides those here in Shangri-La.
Who and what is Shangri-La? You?
Goodness, no.
- So there are others?
- Yes.
- Who, for instance?
- In time you will meet them all.
For a man who talks a lot, it's amazing how unenlightening you can be.
There are some things, my dear Conway,
I deeply regret I may not discuss.
That's the fourth time you've said that.
You should record it.
Let's go inside.
I'd like to show you our rare treasures.
- Good afternoon.
- Excuse me, l...
Please, don't go.
Tea will be served any moment.
Won't you come in?
My name is Maria.
Won't you sit down?
By the way, what religion do you follow here?
To put it simply, I should say that our general belief was in moderation.
We preach the virtue of avoiding excesses of every kind.
Even including excess of virtue itself.
That's intelligent.
In the valley, it makes for better happiness among the natives.
We rule with moderate strictness...
...and in return, we are satisfied with moderate obedience.
As a result, our people are moderately honest, moderately chaste...
...and somewhat more than moderately happy.
How about law and order?
You have no soldiers or police?
Good heavens, no!
How do you deal with incorrigibles, criminals?
We have no crime here.
What makes a criminal?
Lack, usually. Avariciousness, envy.
The desire to possess something owned by another.
There can be no crime when there is a sufficiency of everything.
You have no disputes over women?
Only very rarely.
It wouldn't be considered good manners to take a woman that another man wanted.
Suppose he wanted her so badly that he didn't give a hang...
...if it was good manners or not.
In that event, it would be good manners on the part of the other man...
...to let him have her.
That's very convenient. I think I'd like that.
You'd be surprised how a little courtesy all around...
...helps to smooth out the most complicated problems.
At some time in the future you will have the pleasure of meeting her.
Some man had better get ready to be very courteous to me.
Mr. Chang, all these things, books, instruments, sculpture...
...were they all brought in over those mountains by porters?
They were.
- That must have taken...
- Centuries.
Centuries.
Where did you get the money to pay for all these treasures?
We have no money as you know it.
We do not buy or sell or seek personal fortunes...
...because there is no uncertain future here for which to accumulate it.
That would suit me perfectly.
I'm always broke.
How did you pay for them?
Our valley is very rich in a metal called gold...
...which, fortunately for us, is valued very highly in the outside world.
- So, we merely...
- Buy and sell.
Buy and sell...
Pardon me. Exchange.
I see. Gold for ideas.
There's something so simple and naive about all this...
...that I suspect there's been a shrewd guiding intelligence somewhere.
Whose idea was it? How did it all start?
That, my dear Conway, is the story of a remarkable man.
Who?
A Belgian priest by the name of Father Perrault.
The first European to find this place and a very great man indeed.
He is responsible for everything you see here.
He built Shangri-La, taught the natives...
...and began our collection of art.
In fact, Shangri-La is Father Perrault.
When was all this?
Way back in 1713, I think it was...
...that Father Perrault stumbled into the valley, half-frozen to death.
It was typical of the man that one leg being frozen...
...and there being no doctors here, he amputated the leg himself.
He amputated his own leg?
Oddly enough, when he had learned to understand their language...
...the natives told him he could have saved his leg.
It would've healed without amputation.
- They didn't actually mean that?
- Yes. They were very sincere about it, too.
You see, a perfect body in perfect health was the rule here.
They've never known anything different.
What was true for them, they thought would be true for anyone else living here.
Well, is it?
Rather astonishingly so, yes.
Particularly in the case of Father Perrault himself.
When he and the natives had finished building Shangri-La...
...he was 108 years old and still very active...
...in spite of having only one leg.
108 and still active?
You're startled.
No, I'm just a little bowled over, that's all.
Forgive me.
I should've told you it's quite common here to live to a very ripe old age.
Climate, diet, mountain water, you might say.
But we like to believe it is the absence of struggle in the way we live.
In your countries, on the other hand, how often do you hear the expression:
"He worried himself to death," or, "This thing or that killed him"?
- Very often.
- And very true.
Your lives are, therefore, as a rule, shorter.
Not so much by natural death, as by indirect suicide.
That's all very fine if it works out.
A little amazing, of course.
You surprise me.
I surprise you! Now, that's news.
I mean your amazement.
I could've understood it in any of your companions, but you...
...who have dreamed and written so much about better worlds.
Or is it that you fail to recognise one of your own dreams when you see it?
If you don't mind,
I think I'll go on being amazed...
- ... in moderation, of course.
- Then everything's quite all right?
It's terrific!
I just saw something that'd make your hair stand on end.
You see those hills over there? Gold.
Popping right out of them. Tons of it.
You keep this under your hat.
If the others hear about it, they'll declare themselves in.
But if I can mine that stuff,
I'll throw a bombshell into Wall Street.
Now look, I've got a plan and if l...
Say, honey...
...you ain't feeling so well, are you?
Don't pay attention to what those doctors tell you.
I've seen a lot of people fool 'em.
And I've got a hunch this place is gonna be good for you. Honest I have.
Come on, you be a good kid and snap out of it.
And I'll cut you in on the gold deal.
I'm going up and make a deal with Chang right now.
Oh, my!
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Conway.
- You speak English?
- Yes, sir.
- Would you like to take a ride?
- No, thanks. Not just now.
Well, I think I'll take that ride.
Fossils! Why? What for?
Running around digging up a lot of old bones.
You didn't dig yourself out of one of those holes by any chance?
You seem gay. Did you find out anything?
I heard that if you want a man's wife, she's yours if he's got any manners.
- Nothing about the porters yet?
- Porters?
We've been here two weeks and we haven't found out a thing.
Well, we haven't been murdered in our beds yet, have we?
I'm afraid the porters are just a myth.
Guess we'll never know why we're here or how long we'll be held prisoners.
Hurry up, you slowpokes. I'm starved.
"Please, do not wait for me.
"I eat so very little. "
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
I'm glad to see us all finally organised.
Okay, handsome.
Dish it out and make it snappy.
- What's happened to you?
- Nothing. Why?
You look beautiful.
That's unkind.
Miss Stone always looks beautiful.
I got it. It's your make-up.
You've got none on.
Honey, you look a million percent better.
Wholesome, kind of, and clean.
Take a tip from me, don't ever put that stuff on your face again.
It's like hiding behind a mask.
Who're you to talk about a mask?
What do you mean?
You've been wearing a mask ever since we met you.
Have I?
Strange, you've never told us anything about yourself.
Who are you, anyway?
Why not take your mask off for once?
Unbosom yourself, Mr. Hyde.
All right, I will.
I'll let my hair down.
Why not?
It can't make any real difference now.
Lovey...
- ... were you ever chased by the police?
- Certainly not!
Believe me, it's no fun.
When you picked me up at Baskul, they were on my tail for a year.
The police?
Did you ever hear of Chalmers Bryant?
Chalmers Bryant?
Bryant Utilities. That's me.
I knew it.
I knew I had a reason for hating you.
Sir, you're a thief!
He never stole from you, did he?
I have 500 shares of Bryant Utilities
I bought with money...
...l'd saved for 20 years, teaching school.
Now, I couldn't sell it for postage stamps.
That's too bad. I got a half million shares.
My whole foundation. Now look at me.
The nerve you have sitting there, talking about it so calmly.
The swindler of thousands of people.
That's what makes the whole thing so funny.
A guy like me, starts out in life as a plumber.
An ordinary, everyday slew-footed plumber.
And by the use of a little brains, he builds up a gigantic institution.
Employs thousands of people.
Becomes a great civic leader.
Then the crash comes.
Overnight, he's the biggest crook the country ever had.
You're a thief and a swindler...
...and I'll be glad to turn you over to the police when we get back.
"When we get back! "
What makes you think we'll ever get back?
You're all prisoners here.
We were kidnapped and brought here and nobody knows why.
I don't want to be a prisoner.
I'm finding out when we're leaving here.
I'll make that Chinese talk if it's the last thing I do.
Where's Chang?
Where's Chang or I'll blow your brains out?
- What do you think you're doing?
- Let me go.
Come here!
Come here, you!
You idiot!
Had to sock him?
- Let me up.
- You all right?
Sorry.
Is it true about us being kidnapped?
I say, is it true about us being kidnapped?
Mr. Chang!
Do you mind stepping in here for a moment?
Won't you sit down?
You have been very kind to us and we appreciate it.
But for some reason we're being held prisoners here...
...and we want to know why.
Personally, I don't mind at all.
I'm enjoying every minute of it.
But my brother is not of the same opinion, nor are the others.
It's time we were told what it's all about.
We want to know why we were kidnapped, why we're being kept here...
...but most important of all, do we get the porters and when?
Until we get this information...
...l'm very much afraid we cannot permit you to leave this room.
You know, it's very strange...
...but when you saw me in the corridor,
I was actually on my way to you.
I bring the most amazing news.
The High Lama wishes to see you.
- The High Lama? Who in blazes is he?
- I thought you ran this joint.
High lamas or low lamas, do we get the porters?
The High Lama is the only one from whom any information can come.
- Don't believe him.
- Sounds like a stall to me.
- Better have him talk...
- One moment.
You say the High Lama's the only one who can give us information?
The only one.
And he can arrange for the porters to take us back?
The High Lama arranges everything.
Then he's the man I want to see.
Will you come along?
Better wait here until I get back.
We'll soon know where we stand.
Good evening.
Please, come in.
Sit here, near me.
I'm an old man and can do no one any harm.
Are you the High Lama?
Yes.
I trust you've been comfortable at Shangri-La, since your arrival.
Personally, I've enjoyed your community very much.
But my friends do not care for this mystery.
They are determined to leave as soon as...
It's astonishing and incredible, but...
What is it, my son?
You're the man.
Chang told me. You're the first who...
Two hundred years ago.
You're still alive, Father Perrault.
Sit down, my son.
You may not know it, but I've been an admirer of yours...
...for a great many years.
Not of Conway, the empire builder and public hero.
I wanted to meet the Conway who in one of his books said:
"There are moments in every man's life when he glimpses the eternal. "
That Conway seemed to belong here.
In fact, it was suggested that someone be sent to bring him here.
That I be brought here?
Who had that brilliant idea?
Sondra Bizet.
The girl at the piano?
Yes. She has read your books and has a profound admiration for you.
As have we all.
Of course, I've suspected that our being here was no accident.
Furthermore, I have a feeling we're never supposed to leave.
But that, for the moment, doesn't concern me greatly.
I'll meet that when it comes.
What particularly interests me at present is why was I brought here?
What possible use can I be to an already thriving community?
We need men like you here...
...to be sure that our community will continue to thrive.
In return for which
Shangri-La has much to give you.
You are still, by the world's standards, a youngish man.
Yet in the normal course of existence...
...you can expect 20 or 30 years...
...of gradually diminishing activity.
Here, however, in Shangri-La...
...by our standards, your life has just begun.
And may go on and on.
To be candid, Father, a prolonged future doesn't excite me.
It would have to have a point.
I sometimes doubted whether life itself has any.
If that is so, then long life must be even more pointless.
I'd need a much more definite reason for going on and on.
We have reason.
It is the entire meaning and purpose of Shangri-La.
It came to me in a vision...
...long ago.
I saw all the nations strengthening...
...not in wisdom, but in the vulgar passions and the will to destroy.
I saw their machine power multiplying...
...until a single-weaponed man might match a whole army.
I foresaw a time when man, exulting in the technique of murder...
...would rage so hotly over the world...
...that every book, every treasure would be doomed to destruction.
This vision was so vivid and so moving...
...that I determined to gather together all things of beauty...
...and culture that I could and preserve them here...
...against the doom toward which the world is rushing.
Look at the world today.
Is there anything more pitiful?
What madness there is, what blindness, what unintelligent leadership.
A scurrying mass of bewildered humanity crashing headlong against each other...
...compelled by an orgy of greed and brutality.
The time must come, my friend...
...when this orgy will spend itself.
When brutality and the lust for power...
...must perish by its own sword.
Against that time is why I avoided death and am here...
...and why you were brought here.
For when that day comes, the world must begin to look for a new life.
And it is our hope that they may find it here.
For here, we shall be with their books...
...and their music and the way of life...
...based on one simple rule:
Be kind.
When that day comes...
...it is our hope that the brotherly love of Shangri-La...
...will spread throughout the world.
Yes, my son, when the strong have devoured each other...
...the Christian ethic may at last be fulfilled...
...and the meek shall inherit the earth.
I understand you, Father.
You must come again, my son.
Good night.
Well?
- What did you find out?
- We thought you were never coming back.
- When do we leave?
- What about the porters?
Porters?
- Didn't you find out about the porters?
- Why, I'm sorry, but l...
What were you doing all this time?
What's the matter with you?
You went there...
Do you mind?
I'm sorry, but I can't talk about it tonight.
Hello.
Good morning.
"Lay thee down now, and rest
"May thy slumber be blessed
"Lullaby, and good night
"Thy mother's delight
"Bright angels around
"My darling shall sound
"They will guard thee from harm"
Do you mind?
"They will guard thee from harm
"Thou shall wake in my arms"
This is Mr. Conway, children.
Good morning, Mr. Conway.
- How do you do?
- Very well, thank you.
Children, Teacher is going to be very busy this afternoon.
So, school's dismissed.
Please.
I hope you're not going to run away this time.
My name's Sondra.
I hope you'll forgive me for...
You know, each time I see you,
I hear that music.
What is it?
You mean my pigeons.
It's these little flutes that I attached to their tails. See?
Come along with me and I'll show you how I put them on.
This is how we tie them on.
By varying the size of the flutes,
I can get any notes I wish.
The wind does the rest.
Here's a little fellow who has lost his.
- Was this your idea?
- Yes.
Hold this pigeon.
You suggested my being brought here, didn't you?
What gave you the idea I'd fit in?
- That was easy. I'd read your books.
- You've read my books?
You do more things.
What have my books got to do with it?
I saw a man whose life was empty.
"A man whose life was empty. "
I know, it was full of this and full of that.
But you were accomplishing nothing.
You were going nowhere and you knew it.
As a matter of fact, all I saw was a little boy whistling in the dark.
"A little boy whistling... "
Do you realise that there was a British cruiser waiting at Shanghai...
...smoke pouring out of its funnels, tugging at its moorings...
...waiting to take Mr. Conway back to London.
Do you know right now there are headlines shrieking the news...
...that Conway's missing? Does that look like a man who's life was empty?
Yes.
You're absolutely right.
I had to come to a pigeon house in
Shangri-La to find the only other person...
...who knew it. May I congratulate you?
I only brought you here to show you my pigeons.
Don't worry about them.
Now you can put flutes on my tail and bells on my feet.
I've so many questions I'd like to ask,
I don't know where to begin.
I'll help you. To begin with, you'd like to know what I'm doing here.
- That I was born here.
- Thank you.
Well, I was almost born here.
It took place in that wild country beyond the pass.
My parents were in a party of explorers who got lost and wandered for a year.
When Chang found us only father and I were alive.
He was too weak to climb the pass.
He died on the way.
I was brought up by Father Perrault.
I envy you.
- I talked to him last night.
- I know.
I can't quite get used to this age thing.
I'm 30.
You're going to make life very simple.
It's inconceivable.
- What?
- All of it.
Father Perrault and his magnificent history.
This place, hidden away from the rest of the world...
...with its glorious concepts.
And now you come along and confuse me entirely.
I'm sorry. I thought I was to be the light.
Why do I confuse you? Am I so strange?
On the contrary, you're not strange.
And that in itself is confusing.
I had the same idea about Shangri-La.
The sense I've been here before, that I belonged here.
I'm so glad.
I can't quite explain it, but everything is somehow...
...familiar.
The very air that I breathe. The lamasery...
...with its feet rooted in the good earth of this fertile valley...
...while its head explores the eternal.
All the beautiful things I see, these cherry blossoms, you...
...all somehow are familiar.
I've been kidnapped and brought here against my will.
A crime, a great crime, yet I accept it amiably.
With the same amiability one tolerates only from a very dear and close friend.
Why? Can you tell me why?
Maybe 'cause you've always been part of Shangri-La without knowing it.
- I wonder.
- I'm sure of it.
Just as I am sure there's a wish for Shangri-La in everyone's heart.
I've never seen the outside world, but I understand there are many people...
...who are supposed to be mean and greedy.
I just know that secretly they are all hoping to find a garden spot...
...where there is peace and security.
Where there's beauty and comfort.
Where they wouldn't have to be mean and greedy.
I just wish the whole world might come to this valley.
Then it wouldn't be a garden spot for long.
I don't know why I associate with you,
Mr. Barnard or Mr. Chalmers Bryant...
...or Mr. Embezzler, or whatever your name may be.
- Just call me Barney.
- Barney? Why should I?
Never, we have nothing in common.
What effrontery!
Okay, Lovey.
And this trip to the valley.
Why did I allow you to drag me here?
You don't know anything about these people.
We're not even armed.
They're very nice people, except that they've got horns.
- Horns?
- You know.
Horns.
What kind of horns?
Come on. They won't hurt you.
All I want is a glass of wine.
- Thanks.
- Sit down.
Now this is fine. This is swell.
No, thanks, just a drink.
I've been walking and I'm a little thirsty.
That's all right.
I just don't happen to be very hungry.
All I asked for was a glass of wine.
Look here, I've got to have some help with this.
Where is Lovey?
Look!
Mr. Barnard!
Come here!
I asked for a glass of wine, look what I got.
Come on, sit down.
This is where you are.
I might have known.
- No wonder you couldn't hear me.
- Relax and have a glass of wine.
- Sit down!
- And be poisoned out here in the open?
- Won't you please have a glass of wine?
- I never drink wine, in the daytime.
- There you are.
- This doesn't obligate me in any way.
No.
The bears came right into the bedroom and the little baby bear said:
"Somebody's been sleeping in my bed. "
And then the mama bear said:
"Somebody's been sleeping in my bed. "
And then the big papa bear, he roared:
"And somebody's been sleeping in my bed. "
You have to admit, the poor little bears were in a quandary.
Well, I'm going to sleep in my bed.
Come on, Lovey.
- They were in a quandary.
- Come on, Lovey.
Why, "Come on" all the time?
What's the matter, you going to be a fuss-budget all your life?
Drink it up. Aren't you having any fun?
- Where was I?
- In a quandary.
I'm telling this story.
The poor little bears...
...they didn't know what to do.
Somebody had been sleeping in their beds.
Who slept in their beds?
Who was it, Lovey?
You called me "Lovey"?
Look at those eyes.
There's the devil in those eyes.
"Here we go gathering nuts in May
"Here we go gathering nuts in May
Early on Tuesday morning
"Here we go, Shangri-La, Shangri-La
"Here you are in Shangri-La"
Hello, Maria.
You promised to come for tea yesterday.
I waited for so long.
Sorry.
- I haven't got any cigarettes left.
- I'll make some for you.
You will come today?
Perhaps.
Please say you will.
The days are very long and lonely without you.
Please.
All right, I'll be there.
Thank you.
You'll tell me the things
I want to know, right?
Who's in charge? Why we were kidnapped and what will happen to us?
Chang's been lying about those porters, hasn't he?
Beautiful.
- I'm waiting for the bump.
- "Bump"?
When the plane lands at Shanghai and wakes us all up.
You see. It's not a dream.
I sometimes think that the other is the dream.
The outside world.
- Have you never wanted to go there?
- Goodness, no!
From what you tell me, it doesn't sound very attractive.
It's not so bad really.
Some phases of it are sordid, of course.
That's only to be expected.
Why?
Usual reasons.
- A world of people struggling for existence.
- Struggling? Why?
Everyone naturally wants to make a place for himself.
- Accumulate a nest egg and so on.
- Why?
If you keep on asking that, we're not going to get anywhere.
- And don't ask me why.
- I was just going to.
It's the most annoying word in the English language.
Ever hear a child torture his parent with it?
"Mother's darling mustn't stuff her fingers in the salad bowl. "
"Why?"
"Because it isn't ladylike to do that. "
"Why?"
"That's what forks are made for, darling. "
- "Why, Mother?"
- "Mother read it in a book somewhere.
"If Mother's little darling doesn't take her fingers...
"... out of the salad bowl this instant,
Mother's going to wring her little neck. "
- Would you like to wring my little neck?
- I'd love it.
Why?
I'm sorry.
I've thought about it for years.
I knew you'd come.
And I knew when you did, you'd never leave.
Am I forgiven for sending for you?
Forgiven.
When we were on that plane...
...I was fascinated by the way its shadow followed it.
That silly shadow...
...racing along over mountains and valleys...
...covering 10 times the distance of the plane.
Yet always there to greet us with outstretched arms when we landed.
I've been thinking that somehow you're that plane...
...and I'm that silly shadow.
That all my life,
I've been rushing up and down hills...
...leaping rivers, crashing over obstacles...
...never dreaming that one day, that beautiful thing in flight...
...could land on this earth and into my arms.
This place is amazing.
That marble quarry in the valley is simply magnificent.
I've looked around. I've seen everything.
Your woodworkers and your cloth weavers are all so happy.
You may not know it, but right here you have Utopia.
- You're very kind.
- I don't mean it in that sense.
I only give credit where credit is due.
I'm very anxious to have you realise that I never for a moment believed...
...that ridiculous kidnapping story.
- I'm so glad.
- Simply preposterous.
Do you know what I did last night?
I held a sort of a self inventory.
I said to myself last night,
"Lovey, Mr. Lovett... "
- I said, "You are an ungrateful fool. "
- No.
Those are my very words to myself last night.
"These people here are doing everything to make your stay comfortable...
"... and I haven't done one single thing to show my appreciation. "
What would you like to do?
I thought with your permission and while I'm waiting for these porters...
...l'd like to organise classes for the children in the valley...
...and teach them something practical and something useful. Geology.
- Splendid.
- Isn't it?
I was a professor for 20 years.
- And a very good one.
- I'm sure you were.
- When would you like to start?
- Immediately.
Then it's done.
Thank you.
You get the idea?
From this reservoir here,
I can pipe the whole works.
I'm going to get a kick out of this.
It's just to keep my hand in.
With the equipment we have here...
...I can put a plumbing system in the whole village. Rig it up in no time.
Do you realise those people are still going to the well for water?
- It's unbelievable.
- Think of it! In times like these!
What about that gold deal?
- Gold, you know...
- Oh, that.
That can wait.
Nobody's going to run off with it.
I've got to get busy.
I want to show this layout to Chang.
- Don't you take any wooden nickels.
- All right.
You're acting like a child.
You haven't talked for two weeks.
There's nothing to say.
- I'm afraid that does it.
- I'm afraid it does.
Shall we have another?
Not tonight, if you don't mind.
Come in, my dear.
Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.
I thought Mr. Conway's brother was here.
Excuse me.
Charming, isn't she?
Yes. Charming.
Your brother seems quite fascinated by her.
Why not?
She's an attractive young woman.
Young? She arrived here in 1888.
She was 20 at the time.
She was on her way to join her betrothed...
...when her carriers lost their way in the mountain.
The party would've perished, but for meeting some of our people.
Amazing. Still doesn't look over 20.
When is she likely to grow old in appearance?
Not for years. Shangri-La will keep her youthful indefinitely.
Suppose she should leave?
Leave Shangri-La?
That's not likely.
You couldn't drive her out.
I mean her appearance.
If she should leave the valley, what would happen?
She'd quickly revert in appearance to her actual age.
It's weird.
How old are you?
Age is a limit we impose upon ourselves.
Each time you Westerners...
...celebrate your birthday, you build another fence around your minds.
There you are! You're just the man
I'm looking for. A fine trick.
Smart, aren't you? What lies you told us about those porters!
The minute they arrive we can leave, if they'd take us.
- But you know you'd tell 'em not to.
- My dear boy...
You've been lying since we arrived.
It's worked for some people.
Because they lack the courage to do something. But not me.
You're up against the wrong man.
I'll leave, even if I have to blow this place into the valley.
I'll get out, porters or no porters!
You must prevail upon him not to attempt the journey.
He could never get through that country alive.
I can't let him go alone. It's suicide.
Yes, of course your brother is a problem.
It was to be expected.
I knew you'd understand.
That's why I came to you for help.
You must not look to me for help.
Your brother is no longer my problem.
He is now your problem.
Mine?
Because, my son,
I'm placing in your hands...
...the future and destiny of Shangri-La...
...for I am going to die.
I knew my work was done, when I first set eyes upon you.
I've waited for you, my son, for a long time.
I've sat in this room and seen the faces of newcomers.
I've looked into their eyes and heard their voices...
...always in hope that I might find you.
My friend, it is not an arduous task that I bequeath...
...for our order knows only silken bonds.
To be gentle and patient.
To care for the riches of the mind.
To preside in wisdom...
...while the storm rages without.
Do you think this will come in my time?
You, my son, will live through the storm.
You will preserve the fragrance of our history...
...and add to it a touch of your own mind.
Beyond that, my vision weakens.
But I see at a great distance...
...a new world stirring in the ruins...
...stirring clumsily...
...but in hopefulness...
...seeking its lost and legendary treasures...
...and they will all be here, my son.
Hidden behind the mountains...
...in the Valley of the Blue Moon...
...preserved as by a miracle.
We run the pipes through here and connect with the main waterline here.
Where are you going to get pipes?
That's a cinch. I'll show them how to cast pipes out of clay.
There you are. You'd better get your things together. We're leaving.
- Leaving?
- The porters are taking us back.
We've got clothing, food, everything.
When are you going to start?
This very minute.
They're waiting for us on the plateau.
That Chinaman thought he could stop me.
Come along.
I think I'll stick around.
I'll leave with the porters on the next trip.
You mean you don't want to go?
Well, I'm...
You're afraid of going to jail.
You see I've got this plumbing business.
If you insist being an idiot,
I won't coax you. How about you?
You don't want to go yet, honey.
She'll stick around, too. That right?
If you want me to.
Sure. Don't you worry.
I'll take care of you.
All right, suit yourself, but just remember you had your chance.
- How about you? Do you want to go?
- Where?
Home. I've got porters to take us back.
I'm sorry. That's impossible.
I have my classes.
I don't care what you've started.
Do you want to go?
No, I think I'd better wait.
- Yes, I'll wait.
- You'll wait until you rot!
- Hello, Gloria.
- Hello.
I've just finished translating an interesting old tablet.
It told me of the origin of the Masonic symbols...
- That's swell.
- What?
I want to show you something.
Isn't that pretty. What is it?
Plumbing. Everything modern.
I'm going to run pipes all through the village.
Hello, George.
You can stop worrying now.
I've made arrangements to leave.
If you let me close that window,
I can talk to you.
That noise is driving me crazy.
I said we're getting out of here.
Back to civilisation.
I made a deal with the porters.
They're leaving tomorrow at dawn.
They're waiting for us outside the valley.
Get your things together.
- Where's your topcoat?
- You can't leave.
What's going to stop me?
- You've got to stay here now.
- Stay here?
What's the matter with you?
You've acted strangely since we came.
I've never seen you like this.
What's stopping us from leaving?
Something grand and beautiful.
Something I've been searching for all my life.
The answer to the confusion and bewilderment of a lifetime.
I've found it and I can't leave it.
You mustn't either.
I don't know what you're talking about.
You're carrying around a secret that's eating you up.
- Tell me about it.
- I want to tell you.
I'll burst with it if I don't.
It's weird and fantastic and unbelievable...
...but so beautiful. As you know, we were kidnapped and brought here...
And that's the whole story.
He died, as peacefully as the passing of a cloud's shadow. His last words were:
"I place in your hands, my son...
"... the future and destiny of Shangri-La. "
Now you know why I can't leave.
I really don't know what to say.
- Except that you must be completely mad.
- You think I'm mad?
What else can I think after a tale like that?
Things like that don't happen today.
- We're living in the 20th century.
- You think it's nonsense?
You've been hypnotised by fanatics.
I wouldn't believe it in England.
Why should I swallow it here in Tibet?
How do you know these things are true?
- Did they show you proof?
- I don't need proof.
I knew there was a reason why I hated this place.
I'd love to fly over it with bombs for what they've done to you.
All this talk about lamas being hundreds of years old.
How do you know?
Did you see their birth certificates?
I can't believe it.
A bunch of old men sit around and dream about reforming the world...
...and you, two-feet-on-the-ground Conway, want to join them.
It's horrible.
Is that all my story meant to you?
What else could it mean to me?
It's obviously a lot of bunk.
Then you'd better go.
This is no place for you.
It's no place for you.
Think of what's waiting for you.
Do you want to stay here till you're half dead?
Till your mind starts corroding like the rest of them?
- I don't want to talk about it anymore.
- You've got to talk.
And me?
They stole the plane to bring you here.
I didn't want to come.
You owe me some responsibility.
I'm tired of owing you things.
You're free to go. Go ahead.
It's that girl.
- That girl has twisted and turned...
- That's enough. Never mind the girl.
Why don't you go?
Look here.
Ever since I can remember you've looked after me.
Now, you're the one that needs looking after.
I'm your brother.
If there's something wrong with you...
...let me help you.
I don't feel like making that trip alone.
You couldn't possibly stay here, could you?
I'd go mad.
I may be wrong. I may be a maniac...
...but I believe in this and I'm not going to lose it.
You know how much I want to help you...
...but this is bigger, stronger if you like, than brotherly love.
I'm sorry. I'm staying.
I can't think of anything more to say.
Goodbye.
Are you sure the porters will take care of you?
It's all set.
- Maria made the arrangements.
- Maria?
- The little Russian girl.
- How's she involved?
- She's going with me.
- You're crazy.
- You can't take her away from here.
- Why not?
You can't. Do you know what will happen if she leaves Shangri-La?
She's fragile and can only live where fragile things are loved.
Take her out of this valley and she'll fade away like an echo.
What do you mean,
"Fade away like an echo"?
She came here in 1888.
This'd be funny, if it weren't so pathetic.
She isn't a day over 20.
- You're wrong.
- I'm not wrong. She told me so.
Besides, she wouldn't have to tell me.
I'd know anyway.
I found out a lot of things last night.
I'm not ashamed of it.
It's one of the few decent things...
...that's ever happened in this hellish place.
Everyone is happy in Shangri-La.
Nobody would ever think of leaving.
It's all just rot!
She's pleaded with me since I came to take her away from this place.
She's cried in my arms, for fear I'd leave her here.
She's made two trips to the plateau to bribe the porters. For me!
I don't believe a word of it.
All right, I'll prove it to you.
You've believed everything they're told you without proof. I'll prove my story.
Come in a minute.
I've got some bad news for you.
My brother and I've decided we can't take you along.
You can't take me?
You promised to take me with you!
It's all your fault.
It was all arranged until he spoke to you.
Why can't you leave us alone?
- You want to leave Shangri-La?
- I'll die if I have to stay another minute.
I've waited a long time for this chance and you're not going to stop me now.
If I have to, I'll go alone.
I brought the porters.
If it weren't for me, you'd never get out.
The High Lama told them not to take anyone.
The High Lama!
Who pays any attention to him?
The porters laugh at the High Lama.
They only want to know how much gold he'll give.
I gave them more gold.
I've been stealing it for a year.
I'd do anything to leave this place.
To leave the High Lama, who calls himself Father Perrault.
He's been insane for years.
- Father Perrault is dead.
- He's dead! That's fine.
You won't see me shedding any tears over him.
You must take me with you.
Aren't you afraid to leave?
You don't want to look like an old woman, do you?
Old woman?
- Chang told you that, didn't he?
- Yes.
I thought so.
He tells everyone I'm old.
He wants them to stay away from me.
He gets mad when anyone comes near me.
He's punished me for every minute
I've spent with George.
If it weren't for him, I'd have left long ago.
But he always stops me.
Six months ago I tried to escape and he locked me in a dark room.
I nearly went crazy.
Look at me! Do I look like an old woman?
Is this the skin of an old woman?
Look into my eyes.
Are these the eyes of an old woman?
She was kidnapped and brought here two years ago just as we were.
I don't believe it. I can't believe it.
She's lying.
You're lying.
Every word you've been saying is a lie.
Say it! You're lying, aren't you?
No, I'm not lying.
What reason could I have for lying?
Chances are we'll never come out of that horrible trip alive.
But I'd rather die out there in a snowstorm, be buried alive...
...than to stay here one more minute.
- You say the porters are waiting for us?
- Yes.
- Clothes?
- Yes, everything.
What about the others?
I've asked them.
They're afraid to make the trip.
We'll have to send an expedition back after them.
Come on, we're wasting time.
- Are you taking me?
- Certainly. Come on.
It won't be long before we're in London.
Can't you just see everyone when we pop in out of the blue?
We'll have them breathless when we tell them our story.
You had me worried for a while.
I thought you were gone completely.
Lucky for me you snapped out of it.
You saved my life.
- I never could have made it alone.
- What was that?
- I was saying...
- Shut up! Must you go on babbling?
- What's happened? Where's Bob?
- He's going, my child.
- Going?
- But he will return.
No!
I can't stand it. I can't go on anymore.
I've got to rest.
How long is this going to go on?
I can't stand it.
Can't you get them to wait for us?
They're leaving us farther behind every day.
There's nothing that would suit 'em more than to lose us, but we must go on.
- Come on, darling.
- I can't. You've got to let me rest.
Target practice again.
One of these days they're going to hit us.
As long as they keep on aiming at us, we're safe. Come now.
Look at her face!
"Dropping from nowhere after a year! "
- Cable from Gainsford.
- Read it!
"Leaving today for London with Conway aboard S.S. Manchuria.
"Conway can tell nothing of his experiences.
"Is suffering from complete loss of memory. " Signed, Gainsford.
- "Loss of memory"?
- All right, give it to the press.
- All of it?
- Yes. Might as well all of it.
I'll dispatch a convoy to meet him.
Conway's gone again.
Listen to this, from Gainsford.
Let me have it.
"Aboard S.S. Manchuria.
"Last night Conway recovered his memory.
Talked about Shangri-La.
"Telling a fantastic story about a place in Tibet.
"Insisted upon returning there at once.
"Locked him in, but he escaped and jumped ship at Singapore.
"I'm leaving ship to overtake him, as fearful of his condition.
"Wrote down details of Conway's story about Shangri-La, which I am forwarding.
"Lord Gainsford. "
Here's Gainsford now.
- It's good to see you back.
- Glad to see you.
- It's good to see you again.
- Thought you would never come.
- Sit down. Have a drink.
- Scotch and soda. I'm parched.
Here you are. Ready and waiting.
- Any news of Conway?
- We're eager to know what you discovered.
Where is he?
Gentlemen, you see before you a very weary old man...
...who has just ended a chase that lasted nearly 10 months.
You never caught up with him?
Since that night he jumped off the ship, till two weeks ago...
- ... l've been missing him by inches.
- You don't mean it.
- Was he that determined to get back?
- Determined?
Gentlemen, in the whole course of my life,
I've never encountered anything so grim.
During those last 10 months, that man has done the most astounding things.
He learned how to fly, stole a plane, got caught, put in jail, escaped...
...in an amazingly short space of time.
This is only the beginning of his adventure.
He begged and fought, pushing forward to the Tibetan frontier.
Everywhere I heard these amazing stories of the man's adventures.
Positively astounding. Till eventually...
...I trailed him to the most extreme outpost in Tibet.
Of course, he had already gone.
But his memory...
His memory will live with those natives for the rest of their lives.
"The man who was not human," they called him.
They won't forget the stranger who tried six times...
...to climb a mountain pass that no other human being dared to travel.
And six times was forced back by the severest storms.
They won't forget the madman who stole their food and clothing.
Who they locked up in their barracks and who fought six guards to escape.
Their soldiers are still talking about their pursuit to overtake him...
...and shuddering at the memory.
He led them the wildest chase through their own country.
Finally, he disappeared over that very mountain pass...
...that they themselves dared not travel.
And that, gentlemen...
...was the last that any known human being saw of Robert Conway.
That's what I call fortitude.
- Think of it.
- Tell me something, Gainsford.
What do you think of his talk about Shangri-La? Do you believe it?
Yes. I believe it.
I believe it, because I want to believe it.
I give you a toast.
Here's my hope...
...that Robert Conway will find his Shangri-La.
Here's my hope...
...that we all find our Shangri-La.
Look!
- He's dead. His neck's broken.
- Ohh.
What's been going on here?
- Murder, my friend.
- Murder?
- Did you do this?
- No.
The body of the man who killed him lies in there.
- "Body"?
- You mean to say there's two of 'em?
- Oohh.
- Albert, keep an eye on this old cove.
I place him in your custody for the time being.
- I'd rather go with you.
- Chicken-hearted.
How do you expect to win your stripes?
I shan't run away.
[ Grumbles ]
- What was in there?
- A gentleman with a stake driven right through his heart.
- Ooh-ooh-ooh.
- Do you know anything about this?
Yes. I did it.
- Who is he in there?
- His name was Count Dracula.
How long's he been dead?
- About 500 years.
- Five--
Albert, hand me them handcuffs.
- Those won't be necessary, Constable.
- So you say.
One bloke a-weltering in his blood with a stake driven through his heart.
A gentleman lying here with his neck broke.
By the way, who is he?
- A poor, harmless imbecile who ate spiders and flies.
- 'Armless?
Whoa.
This is a case for Scotland Yard.
Come on.
I had no choice.
Naturally, I destroyed him.
Well...
I've heard a great many fantastic stories in my time, Professor Von Helsing...
- but, if you'll forgive my saying so, this one--
- I know.
But surely, surely, you can't expect to face an English jury with such a defence.
It's my only one, because it's true.
It's utterly mad!
"Mad," or unbelievable?
Oh, very well, in deference to your position in the scientific world, let's say "unbelievable."
The strength of the vampire, Sir Basil, lies in the fact that he is unbelievable.
Vampires, vampires-- oh, why do you persist?
Professor Von Helsing, would you mind explaining to me, as you must explain to your jury... just what you mean by "vampires"?
- The undead.
- "Undead"?
Creatures who have never died... who prolong their unnatural lives by draining the blood of the living.
At night, they leave their graves and roam abroad like wolves seeking their prey.
When daylight comes, they must return to their graves... or die.
And this Count Dracula is one of those-- those fabulous creatures?
Is that what you expect me to believe?
Yes, yes!
He came to England from his ancient castle in Transylvania. bringing with him boxes of earth from his native grave.
Using Carfax Abbey as his base, he descended upon London for fresh victims.
There were many mysterious attacks... each person found drained of blood.
I was able to trace those attacks to their source... locate Dracula's hiding place and drive that stake through his heart.
Professor, whom have you decided to retain for your defence?
There is only one man who might understand, my friend,Jeffrey Garth.
Garth? Why, Garth's not an advocate.
He's a psychiatrist.
He alone will understand.
Professor Von Helsing, you may, of course, use your own judgement... but I advise you to consider, carefully... you have admitted to killing a man in a very horrible manner-- by driving a stake through his heart.
That is the only way a vampire can be destroyed.
And, as head of Scotland Yard,
I must warn you... that there are only two courses which can be taken: either to formally charge you with murder and send you to the gallows... or to have you committed to an institution for the criminally insane.
Sir Basil, listen to me and believe me, I implore you.
In destroying the monster, Dracula,
I performed a service to humanity.
- Beg pardon, Sir Basil.
- Yes, yes, Squires, yes?
That constable's on the wire again, wants to know what's being done about the bodies.
What constable?
What bodies?
The constable at Whitby, sir, about the bodies of Count Dracula and the man Renfield.
Oh. Well, tell him I am sending for them this evening on the 10.00... and tell him to keep guard over them and let no one near them.
[ Clears Throat ]
I wish that bloke'd hurry up and get here from Scotland Yard so we could go home.
9.30. Hmm.
Better get started for the station.
- Right-o.
- Not you.
You heard orders.
Keep 'em under guard.
You don't mean to say you're gonna leave me here alone with them?
Someone's got to meet the train.
- That's etiquette, that is.
- All right, I'll meet the train.
After all, this is your jail.
You can't meet a sergeant from Scotland Yard.
You've no official standing.
- Oh. What's that?
- [ Scratching ]
- [ Scratching Continues ]
- I didn't hear nothing.
In there! Listen!
- Not a peep.
- You'd better have a look.
You heard the noise.
- You have a look.
- [ Clears Throat ]
Here. Take this.
[ Clears Throat ]
Oh!
- What is it?
- A rat.
There's never been no rats in Whitby jail.
There is now.
Here.
Give me that light.
I'll have a look.
Not a rat in sight.
You're worse than an old woman, you are.
[ Scratching ]
[ Shivers ]
Not a single rat... and nothing but two corpses.
I'd better be getting to the station.
Uh, here-- in case they get up and start walkin'.
- Who?
- Them corpses.
[ Stammers ]
And, Albert, remember...
England expects every man to do his duty.
Right.
[ Clears Throat ]
[ Door Rattles, Opens ]
- Are you in charge here?
- Yes, ma'am.
I've come to see the body of Count Dracula.
Sorry, ma'am, it ain't allowed.
- I must.
- Why?
To make sure that he's dead.
You'll have to take my word for it, ma'am.
- He is.
- Where is he?
- In there?
- Sorry, ma'am, you can't go in there.
It's against orders from Scotland Yard.
They'd never know if you didn't tell them.
Orders is orders.
What can I do to persuade you?
Can I offer you money?
I'd rather you wouldn't, ma'am.
Or something more precious than money?
Look.
You've never seen a jewel as beautiful as this... nor as compelling.
You will remember nothing.
Well, here we are, Sergeant.
What about a little drop of the "all right," just to keep the chill off the bones?
- Where've you got the bodies?
- In there.
Albert, this is Sergeant Wilkes of His Majesty's Scotland Yard.
Well, well.
Where's your manners?
What's the matter, lad?
What is it, lad? What's the matter?
Wake up! Wake up!
- Sergeant!
- Here, something's happened to him!
- There's only one body in there.
- What?
See for yourself.
- He's gone!
- Who?
- Count Dracula.
- But you were--
[ Howling ]
[ Howling ]
Unto Adonai and Azrael... into the keeping of the lords of the flame and lower pits I consign this body... to be forevermore consumed in this purging fire.
Let all baleful spirits that threaten the souls of men be banished... by the sprinkling of the salt.
Be thou exorcised, O Dracula... and thy body, long undead... find destruction throughout eternity in the name of thy dark, unholy master.
In the name of the all holiest, and through this cross... be the evil spirit cast out until the end of time.
Free-- free forever.
Do you understand what that means,
Sandor? Free to live as a woman-- free to take my place in the bright world of the living...
- instead of among the shadows of the dead.
- Perhaps.
- What do you mean?
- This night is almost gone.
Who knows what another will bring?
Quick. We must be in
London before dawn.
- The night is here.
- Why are you looking at me that way?
I'm remembering last night... and waiting.
You think this night will be like all the others, don't you?
Well, you're wrong. Dracula's destroyed.
His body's in ashes. The spell is broken.
I can live a normal life now, think normal things. even play normal music again.
Listen.
[ Plays Lullaby ]
A cradle song-- a song my mother once sang to me long, long ago...
- rocking me to sleep as she sang in the twilight.
- Twilight.
Quiet. Quiet.
You disturb me.
Twilight-- long shadows on the hillsides.
- Evil shadows.
- No.
No, peaceful shadows... the flutter of wings in the treetops.
The wings of bats.
No.
No, the wings of birds.
From far off, the barking of a dog.
Barking because there are wolves about.
- Silence! I forbid you!
- "Forbid"?
- Why are you afraid?
- I'm not.
I'm not.
I found release!
- That music doesn't speak of release.
-  [ Accelerating ]
No. No!
You're right!
That music tells of the dark-- evil things, shadowy places.
- Stop. Stop! Stop!
-  [ Stops ]
Sandor, look at me.
What do you see in my eyes?
Death.
[ Door Slams ]
Hurry. Hurry, it's almost daylight.
There's blood on it again.
When did he have the last transfusion?
About four hours before he died.
What do you think caused his death?
An unnatural loss of blood which we've been unable to determine.
If we only knew what caused those two sharp punctures over the jugular vein.
Well, at any rate, a good tramp over the moors and the smell of the heather... may help me forget London and case histories of neurotic ladies.
[ Brogue ] Aye, but remember:
You're not here to doctor the birds, but to shoot them.
There are a few "birds" in London I'd like to shoot, and they haven't feathers either.
- [ Both Chuckle ]
- All right,Jock.
[ Horn Honking ]
It's my assistant,Janet Blake.
I left her in London with orders to forget where I'd gone.
-Jeffrey!
- Well, what in the name of--
Excuse me.
- Well, what do you want?
- You. Come on. Get in.
- You're going back to London.
- Oh, no. I have an appointment with several grouse.
You have an appointment with Scotland Yard.
What for?
I haven't killed anybody.
No, but a friend of yours has-- a man named Von Helsing.
Von Helsing? Professor Von Helsing?
He's in Budapest.
No, he's in London.
He needs help badly.
They tried to reach you here by phone yesterday, and ended by my planing to Edinburgh... and driving from there all night.
- I'm in no mood for an argument!
- Jeffrey, we've barely time to reach the positions.
- Miss Blake, Mr Graham.
- How do you do?
You'll have to forget about me.
Got to dash back to London.
Here, Angus. I knew I had no business buying it in the first place. Keep it for next year.
Besides, I don't trust myself with it at the moment.
- Forgive his bad manners, Mr Graham.
- Never mind my bad manners!
- I'll drop you a line. Good shooting!
- Goodbye.
Just because you're a baronet's daughter, you take liberties an ordinary secretary wouldn't think of.
The ordinary secretary wouldn't have intelligence enough to think of it.
[ Scoffs ] Well, you're driving.
Go ahead.
You want them to hang the man before we get there?
I'm a psychiatrist,
Professor, not a lawyer.
I'd do anything in the world to help you, but what?
You must convince them of my sanity.
If I do that, they'll hang you for murder.
You can't murder a man who's been dead for five centuries.
Talking like that won't help.
When you were a student under me in Vienna,Jeffrey, you had a far more open mind.
My mind is just as open as it ever was, Professor... but it's a scientific mind, and there's no place in it for superstitions.
Superstition?
Who can define the boundary between the superstition of yesterday... and the scientific fact of tomorrow?
In the history of your own profession, psychiatry... a century before, hypnosis was looked up as black magic.
Today it is accepted as commonplace, even used in anaesthesia.
What would have happened to a man a hundred years ago... who advanced the present-day theories of the subconscious?
Oh, I know, I know.
Do you, as an intelligent scientist, dare to dismiss as superstition... the principles underlying
Tibetan magic...
- voodooism, thought transference...
- No.
- Well, there you are.
- Oh, wait, Professor, wait.
Arguments of this sort are all right in academic circles.
You're up against stern reality.
You can't defend yourself by quoting folklore.
There isn't a jury in England that will believe you... and, if I had the most brilliant legal mind in the world,
I couldn't make them.
Then I must stand alone,Jeffrey.
No, Professor. I'll help you.
I don't know how. I haven't the faintest idea where to start.
But I'll stake my reputation against the facts... if there's a way to clear you, I'll do it.
Who did this?
A Hungarian. She just arrived in London a few weeks ago.
- She's charming.
- What's her name?
Countess Marya Zaleska.
Excuse me,Jeffrey.
My dear, how sweet of you to come.
Don't you know it's very rude to stare at strangers?
Thought I'd gotten rid of you for a while.
Not while there's a dangerous-looking brunette like that around.
You know, my guests are dying to meet you.
Countess Zaleska,
I want you to know Jeffrey Garth...
- one of my most intimate friends.
- How do you do?
And Janet Blake... who doesn't like your painting very much.
- No.
- Oh, he doesn't like it, either.
He says that--
- Quiet.
- Sherry, Marya?
No, thank you.
I never drink... wine.
You didn't stay in Scotland long, did you,Jeffrey?
No. Didn't fire a shot... never even saw a grouse, thanks to Father's little helper here.
Oh, that Von Helsing thing.
I've been reading about it in the papers.
That vampire case?
Yes, the man who was known as Count Dracula.
Rum sort of thing.
Seems this fellow, Von Helsing... shoved a stake through this Dracula fellow's heart.
- Do you know him,Jeffrey?
- Mm-hmm. I studied under him.
- I owe most of my success to him.
- What are you going to do?
Well, I don't quite know yet.
One thing I'm pretty sure of... they won't press the murder charge.
They haven't been able to find Dracula's body.
Maybe one of his vampire friends flew in and spirited him away! [ Laughs ]
Well, strangely enough, Von Helsing takes his vampires quite seriously.
Why not? Possibly there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamed of... in your psychiatry, Mr Garth.
I'm sure we'd all be interested to know what modern science has to say about vampires.
Go on,Jeffrey.
But surely you don't believe that preposterous rot, old fellow, what?
But I believe in Von Helsing.
He's gone much deeper into these things than most of us.
Perhaps he's taken them too literally. Such researches can easily lead to obsession.
You mean like people imagining they're Napoleon?
More or less, and like any disease of the mind, it can be cured.
We have to discover what brought about the obsession in order to effect mental release.
- Release?
- Yes, release.
Sympathetic treatment will release the human mind from any obsession.
I'm-I'm interested in what you've been saying, Mr Garth.
I'm wondering if we might... talk about it one evening soon... just you and I.
I'd like to... very much.
You seem to be having quite a lot of trouble.
All I ask is a little cooperation from this blasted--
Ah-ah-ah.
Careful, Doctor. You know what you tell Lady Anstruther about high blood pressure.
Listen, it's after office hours.
Will you go home?
- I'm worried.
- Worried? About what?
- You, tonight.
- Why?
Oh, call it what you like.
All the same... you were the only person at
Lady Esme's party to whom she paid the slightest attention.
- Perhaps I'm intelligent.
- [ Scoffs ]
[ Giggles ]
But odds are you're not getting it tied for at least 40 minutes.
Well, you might help me.
I beg your pardon?
I said, will you tie this tie or won't you?
You just hated to ask me, didn't you?
Well, come on, come on, come on!
You know, really, Doctor,
I've never seen you in such a dither.
I must have underestimated the lady's attractions.
Still, I don't know what you'd do without me.
There.
Goodnight, Doctor.
Good hunting.
Hey!
- What is it, Dr Garth?
- Haven't you noticed?
I've been having tie trouble all evening.
[ Chuckling ]
It looks all right to me.
You know, this is the first woman's flat
I've been in that didn't have... at least 20 mirrors in it?
- I'm glad you're not your friend,
Professor Von Helsing.
- Why?
He'd probably attach some occult significance to my lack of mirrors.
- Occult?
- Well, I seem to remember an old Hungarian legend... that a vampire casts no reflection in a mirror.
[ Chuckles ]
And you being the lady in question?
- Yes, what is it?
- Telephone, for him.
In the hall, Dr Garth.
Thank you.
Yes, Dr Garth speaking.
Well, who is this? What do you want?
[ Affecting German Accent ] Please come right away. This is the zoo speaking.
The what? The zoo?
Ja. One of our elephants is seeing pink men.
All right, now. Now, listen to me,Janet.
This has gone far enough.
There's nothing funny about it.
I'm in the midst of a very serious--
- [ Laughing ]
- Hello!
I don't think that'll happen again.
May I have a cigarette?
Dr Garth...
I ask you here tonight because I need your help.
As a psychiatrist?
As a man of strength and courage.
Well, I'm afraid that places me at a disadvantage.
Do you believe that the dead can influence the living?
Well, in what way?
Could you conceive of a superhuman mentality influencing someone...
- from the other side of death?
- No.
- There is such a one.
- Mm-hmm. Well, go on.
Someone-- Something that reaches out from beyond the grave... and fills me with horrible impulses.
Well, how can I help you?
Use my brain, my will, for an instrument as he has used them, but for release.
- Your mind has the power to do that.
- No.
Your strength lies within yourself.
- Put it to a test.
- A test?
Well, for example--
You know what we do with alcoholics?
We give them liquor, make them sit for hours alone without touching it... make them meet their craving, beat it back-- that is, if they have the will to be free.
- I have.
- Then do this.
The next time you feel this influence, don't avoid it.
Meet it, fight it, score the first victory.
- That's the secret.
- Life against death... the strength of a human mind against the powers of darkness.
I'll help you.
You must. You must-- your strength against his.
Not another phone call.
A woman?
No, a man.
He says it's important.
Oh.
He can help me, Sandor.
This time I'm sure.
Now, look here. I'm tired of being annoyed after office hours.
If you don't stop calling me, I'll come over there and, regardless of your sex...
I'll smack you in the nose!
But... this is Dr Beamish!
Oh, yes.
It's Dr Beamish now, is it?
Well, Doctor, how would you like to go back to the zoo and find a nice empty cage?
I beg your pardon!
This is Dr Beamish of St. Mary's Hospital!
Oh-- Oh, I say, Doctor.
I'm profoundly sorry.
I-- You see, I-- What?
- I've called about Lady Anstruther.
- Oh.
I would like you to go and see her immediately.
That is, if you're in condition to do so.
Well, I'll-I'll come directly.
Right-o.
[ Exhales ]
Would you get my hat and coat, please?
- I'm sorry. I must leave immediately.
- Oh, no.
An obsession case I've been handling has become a bit violent.
But you don't understand.
You must hear me out tonight, now.
Come to see me at the hospital tomorrow afternoon about half past 4.00, hmm?
- I can't do that.
- Oh, but surely, if this is so vital to you--
But you don't understand.
It's-It's impossible.
Can you see me tomorrow at night?
Well, I'll let you know. I think so.
Goodnight, and don't worry.
Are we going out?
We're going to the studio.
Tonight I paint... and I will need a model.
- Wait.
- Leave me alone! I haven't done anything to anybody.
The river is cold and dark.
I know where there is warmth and food and money.
- I don't want your kind of money.
- My mistress is an artist.
She will pay you if you will pose for her tonight.
There's nothing to fear.
Come.
Don't be afraid, my dear.
It was him I wasn't so sure about, ma'am.
Make yourself comfortable over here.
- What's your name?
- Lili.
That's very pretty.
You have beautiful hands, but they're so white and bloodless.
They're cold, ma'am.
- You came here willingly?
- No, not at first.
- Do you know where you are?
- Yes, in Chelsea.
Have you ever seen me before?
No. No, I haven't.
Help yourself, Lili.
Have you ever modelled before?
- No, I haven't.
- I'm doing a study of a young girl's head and shoulders.
You won't object to removing your blouse, will you?
No, I guess not.
You can get ready behind that screen.
Thank you.
I'm ready now.
- I suppose you'll want these pulled down, won't you?
- Yes.
Finish your wine. It'll warm you.
Stand by the fire for a moment.
You mustn't catch cold.
Why are you looking at me that way?
Won't I do?
Yes, you'll do very well indeed.
Do you like jewels, Lili?
This is very old and very beautiful.
I'll show it to you.
I don't think
I'll pose tonight. I--
I think I'll go, if you don't mind.
Please don't come any closer!
[ Screaming ]
[ Siren Wailing ]
[ Policeman's Whistle Blowing ]
[ Bystanders Chattering ]
Can you think of one good reason you shouldn't be dismissed immediately?
Yes, an excellent one.
Of all the childish, thoroughly unpardonable impertinences--
Last night, those phone calls... causing me to tell the chief of staff to go back to the zoo.
Well, so he should. And who was responsible for my phone ringing... every half-hour, all night long?
I was. I told the nurse at the switchboard... to see that you didn't have a wink of sleep!
I thought as much. I only came down this morning to tell you... that you can look for a new assistant.
- My resignation.
- Accepted... with the most ineffable pleasure.
Excuse me, Dr Garth, but Dr Graham wants to know if you will see an emergency patient...
- in 32.
- What for?
An amnesia case.
Something quite unusual.
Unusual, eh?
- Get your notebook and come along with me.
- Oh, no. I'm leaving.
Don't quibble. Come on, come on, come on, come on.
[ Sighs ]
Oh!
Strange case here, Doctor.
We think it's quite hopeless.
Loss of blood, and apparent amnesia.
- What treatment?
- Two transfusions.
- Any response?
- Very little.
- It's not amnesia.
- What is it, then?
Posthypnosis.
What does that chart say?
"Picked up near Curzon St.
No signs of violence.
Rambling, incoherent talk.
Spoke of woman."
Woman? What woman?
What'd she say?
Something about blood; then she lapsed into unconsciousness... and we haven't been able to rouse her since.
I think you've done everything possible.
What about those marks on her neck?
- What marks on her neck?
- Two little punctures... near the jugular vein, like insect bites.
There.
Open that shade a little.
We must bring her out of this coma, if only for a few moments.
Give her adrenaline, and if she rallies, let me know instantly.
- Yes, Doctor.
- What do you think those marks mean?
I'd rather not say.... until I've had a chance to talk with the one man in London... who might explain them--
Professor Von Helsing.
The loss of blood.
The marks on the neck. Hmm.
I don't understand, gentlemen.
I don't see how it can be, but those are the marks of the vampire.
It becomes increasingly evident, owing to the disappearance of Dracula's body... and the subsequent evidence, that he isn't dead at all.
No vampire can survive the stake.
He may have given the appearance of death.
During the day the body lay at Whitby and come to life at night--
Oh, dash it all! You've got me talking this gibberish now.
Dracula had many victims,
Sir Basil... into whose veins he infused his own tainted blood... making them creatures like himself.
Hmm. Sounds very much to me as if you were trying to build up your own defence... if you'll forgive my saying so.
What about the man they found last Friday night... near the embankment?
"Marks: two small punctures, near jugular vein. Resembling pinpricks.
Swollen slightly.
Faint discoloration."
Exactly the same.
You must do something about these attacks, Sir Basil.
- There will be others.
- But of course there'll be.
People are always being attacked in a fog.
That doesn't prove that London is hagridden with vampires.
It's preposterous.
I think you two are trying to pull my leg.
Well, as soon as that girl's in a condition for a posthypnotic examination...
- we'll have something definite to go on.
- How soon will that be?
Tonight.
I'm using the Letelier test.
Find out where the attack took place, and you'll have your vampire.
Well, uh, how will I know whether it's a vampire in good standing... or just... another maniac?
There'll be a box of earth somewhere near at hand,Jeffrey-- a box of its own native soil-- to which the vampire must return at the end of each night.
And another thing:
- There will be no mirrors anywhere about.
- What?
Because a vampire casts no reflection in mirrors.
[ Scoffs ]
Well.
- Well! You might say, "Good evening."
- Good evening.
What are you doing here?
I thought you'd severed all connections with the hospital.
[ Sighs ]
I changed my mind.
I detest vacillating women.
Well, you might as well run along,Janet.
I'm examining that girl we looked at presently.
Tell Aubrey that
I may drop by later.
Who is going to tie your tie?
[ Chuckles ]
My dear child,
I've tied my own tie since I was 16... and if I should have any difficulty,
I'm quite sure that Miss Peabody--
Uh, Miss Peabody?
- Miss Peabody? Would you tie my tie, please?
- Yes, Dr Garth?
I-I'm not sure that I can--
Oh, come, come.
Anybody can tie a tie.
Miss Peabody... um, th-the short end loops over.
- Over.
- Oh, I see. Thank you!
Oh! Uh--
Oh, for goodness'sakes.
-Janet, I assure you--
- Quiet!
There.
Stout fellow.
- Is this--
- Perfect!
Well, why didn't you tie it this way last night? Janet?
- [ Door Slams ]
-Janet!
- Oh, good evening, Miss Blake.
Is Dr Garth here?
- I'm sorry. He's just left.
Oh.
May I go to supper now, Dr Garth?
[ Garth ]
Yes, yes. By all means. Go ahead.
Why was it necessary to lie?
Dr Garth asked me to come this evening.
[ Miss Peabody ]
Well, he-- Go right in, miss.
[ Weakly ]
Thank you.
- Countess Zaleska!
- I had to come.
You-- you said you'd help me.
You're trembling.
Your hands are like ice.
Come. Sit down.
Dr Garth, I--
I can't go on, that is, without you.
You're the one person who stands between me and utter destruction.
I'm leaving London tonight, forever.
- What?
- I-I know the truth now.
There's nothing ahead for me but-- but horror!
You must control yourself if you expect me to understand what you're talking about.
When you left me last night...
I determined to put myself to a test, as you suggested.
I failed!
It came over me again, that overpowering command-- wordless, insistent-- and I had to obey!
- What was it?
- I--
I can't tell you.
It's too-- too ghastly!
I have something here that... may help to steady your nerves.
A mechanical means of inducing hypnosis.
Come here, please.
This little light... shines against the disk... reflected by the mirrors.
- No!
- Why not?
It's too late for experiments.
I'm afraid you're right.
I came to ask you to go with me.
- Go with you?
- Yes, tonight-- to the continent.
Oh, I know it all sounds mad. It is!
But you must do this for me. I'll make any concession, but you must come with me.
- You know that's impossible.
- No, no. Don't say that.
You're a great doctor-- a doctor of minds, of souls.
I need you, Dr Garth.
I need you to save my soul.
How can you expect me even to listen to you... when you're concealing the truth about yourself?
But I have told you all I can now.
You mean, you've told me all you dare.
- [ Telephone Ringing ]
- Pardon me.
- [ Ringing ]
- Yes?
The girl is ready now, Dr Garth.
All right. I'll be there at once.
Pardon me.
I want you to wait here for me.
I'll be back very shortly.
A patient--
I want you to sit down very calmly... and make up your mind exactly how you're going to tell me the truth--
- the entire truth.
- But--
When I come back, we'll decide what can be done... if anything.
Meanwhile...
I wouldn't plan on leaving London tonight, if I were you.
- [ Door Closing ]
- I'll leave... and you'll go with me.
- Where's Dr Garth?
- He'll be back presently.
Won't you sit down?
I'd like to talk to you.
[ Scoffs ] Well, I'm sure we've nothing to discuss, Countess Zaleska.
We might talk of Dr Garth.
He's interested in... both of us.
I'm quite aware of his interest in you, Countess... as a psychiatrist.
Sandor.
[ Gasps ]
- Take her to the car. This way.
- [Janet Screams ]
Lights.
- Don't be afraid.
Nobody's going to hurt you.
- No. No, please!
Let me alone!
Oh, that light-- hurts my eyes.
- Now, now, now, dear. Now.
- Wait.
Just relax. That's better.
Just as though you were going to sleep.
Sound asleep.
That's more like it.
You are sleepy.
It's hard to keep your eyes open... with that light in them, isn't it?
But look at it again... as long as you can.
That's better.
You're almost asleep now.
I want you to try to remember--
Remember.
There are little pictures in your mind-- pictures behind your eyes.
You can see them if you try.
Try. Try!
- You must remember.
- No.
No! No!
Shh. Nothing to be afraid of.
Nothing to fear.
We're here to protect you.
Take it away from my eyes.
- It hurts.
- The light?
The ring.
The ring on your hand.
- Whose hand?
- Your hand, ma'am.
Your eyes.
I don't want to pose.
"Pose"?
Think I'll go, if you don't mind.
Please.
Please let me out, I--
Where are you?
You know.
You remember now.
Your studio.
What studio? Where?
In Chelsea.
I know that.
I used to live here.
Whereabouts in Chelsea?
- You must remember.
- The bookshop's closed.
I don't want to go up those dark stairs.
Let go of my arm.
You're hurting me!
Please!
She's dead.
I think I know where to find the one who's responsible.
Countess Zaleska!
[ Thunderclap ]
- Closing for the night.
- Scotland Yard.
That's different.
What can I do for you?
I'm looking for the studio of a woman who calls herself Countess Zaleska.
Dark, aristocratic.
There's a woman with a place on the third floor.
That ain't her name, but there's some strange goings-on up there.
- Let me use your telephone.
- On the desk. There.
- Beg pardon, sir.
- Yes, Hobbes, yes, what is it?
Can't you see I'm busy?
Dr Garth on the wire, sir.
He says--
Oh, don't stand there telling me what he says. Give me the telephone!
- Yes.
- And Hobbs? Just have a look in that lot there, will you?
See if you can find my Bolivian Blue?
Hello, Hello,Jeffrey.
Yes, yes, what is it? What is it?
- What do you want?
- Take down this address, and bring Von Helsing with you.
Chelsea? Well, what on earth are you doing in Chelsea at this time of night?
- Running down a vampire.
- Vampires. Oh, my--
- Are you drunk?
- Not likely. Will you hurry, please?
All right. All right.
I'll get there as soon as possible... but it's all a pack of nons--
- The Bolivian Blue, sir!
- Idiot, that's a Guatemalan Red.
- Clear away this stuff, will you?
- Yes, sir.
Will you take your barley water now, sir?
Barley water, barley water.
Get me my heavy topcoat and revolver.
- I'm going out after vampires!
- Vampires?
Vampires!
Ha, ha, ha!
Well, I always understood you went after them with checkbooks, sir.
Hobbs, don't be facetious.
N-N-No, sir.
It took you longer than I expected.
- What's all this mean?
- As I told you, I'm leaving tonight... and you're going with me.
No.
- You're coming with me... to Scotland Yard.
- I think not.
I've just come from the bedside of the girl you brought here last night.
Well, she's dead.
What a pity.
She seemed so healthy.
Another victim, last week-- a man.
You're no longer the sympathetic
Samaritan, are you, Dr Garth?
Now you're a policeman.
Nevertheless, you can still help me.
- And you shall.
- Then you must be insane.
Desperate, rather.
There isn't anything I won't do now... to enlist your aid in freeing me of the curse of the Draculas.
- "Draculas"?
- Yes.
I am Dracula's daughter.
Miss Blake.
- What about Miss Blake?
- Do you know where she is?
Yes, Sir Aubrey Bedford's.
- Are you quite sure?
- Positive.
She returned to your study after you left.
We talked, but not too long.
I don't believe you.
Why don't you telephone and find out?
- There's one in that desk.
- Very well.
Hello,Jeffrey, old fellow. Where have you been? When are you coming over?
Pretty soon.
- Is Janet there?
- No, she phoned, about half an hour ago--
What?
- She did what?
- I said, she phoned about half an hour ago.
Said she was meeting you somewhere in Chelsea, of all places.
Some studio or other. I say, what's it all about? Have you found a better party?
Countess Zaleska!
[ Sir Basil ]
Well, this must be the place.
Look here,Jeffrey.
Just what new piece of asininity is this?
She's gone.
She's taken Janet with her.
- Gone? Who's gone?
- Countess Zaleska.
- Dracula's daughter.
- "Dracula's daughter"?
Now, look here, you two.
If you're still playing games with me... if you routed me out of my bed in the middle of the night... to dash down here on some confounded hoax, I--
This is no hoax, Sir Basil.
- Exactly what happened?
- She came to the hospital tonight.
Said she was leaving London.
She begged me to go with her.
- Go with her?
- Well, I refused of course.
Later, after I had examined the girl and traced Zaleska here... she still insisted-- she said she'd force me.
How she got hold of Janet I don't know, but we've got to find them!
Janet's in danger!
Think of what happened to those others.
No, wait. As long as this woman wants to control you...
- she won't harm her.
- What are you standing there for? Do something!
They're still in London.
Send out a general alarm.
Throw a dragnet around the city.
- Where's the telephone?
- In there.
- Zaleska has a flat in Russell Square.
- Oh, she won't be there.
If she manages to slip out of England tonight... there's only one place in this world to which she'll go-- her castle in Transylvania.
[ Sir Basil ]
Hello, hello, hello! Scotland Yard?
Sir Basil Humphrey speaking.
Yes! Get me Squires.
I want a general broadcast.
[ Morse Code Beeping ]
Scotland Yard requests reports about the following--
Uh, I knew I should have turned off my telephone last night.
Yes, well?
What about it?
- What did you find? Oh.
- Nothing, sir.
Nobody at the Russell Square flat, everything torn up--
- no letters, no nothing.
- Huh.
- Dr Garth was there.
- Where is he now?
I don't know, sir.
He went away somewhere in his car.
- [ Ringing ]
- Hello. Yes.
Hello? Uh-- What?
Well, why wasn't it followed?
Somebody'll lose his skin for this, all right.
Dover reports an unidentified plane, no lights, taking off across the Channel an hour ago.
Of course, she'd have made all preparations.
- [ Clicking Phone Switch ]
- Get me the Paris police headquarters.
Well, what are you standing there for?
We must find Jeffrey, and break the news as gently as possible.
-Just came, sir.
- Thank you.
More good news.
Listen to this.
"Chartered plane leaving for Transylvania.
Will keep in touch.Jeffrey Garth."
Stop him!
He's going to his death.
Get me Croydon Airport!
At once, you hear? At once!
[ Folk Tune ]
[ Laughter, Chattering ]
Well, Zoltan, Magdalena-- a fine wedding!
Uh, soon, it will be night.
- [ Howling ]
- A wolf!
[ Howling Continues ]
[ Slows, Stops ]
[ Howling Continues ]
[ Coffin Lid Thumps ]
- [ Townspeople Chattering ]
- The castle!
- The light!
- Dracula!
He's come back!
[ Panicked Chattering ]
The light in the castle--
Dracula!
- What is this?
- The inn, mein Herr. As far as we dare go until morning.
- What?
- The vampire. She walks tonight with her unhallowed father!
- Are you quite sure? Let's get along.
- Ja, ja!
You're just in time. In a few minutes, the doors will be barred until daylight.
I tell you what I'll do.
I'll give you... five pounds... if you take me as far as Borgo Pass, no farther.
- But not further than Borgo Pass!
- That's more like it.
There. And I'll ride in the front seat with you.
- Will you take care of my bag until I come back?
- Yes, sir.
Come along.
He must be mad.
- Beautiful... and helpless.
- Yes.
Why have you left her unharmed?
It's the only way
I can be sure of Garth.
What do you want of Garth?
Release? Still, release?
No, I know that's impossible now.
- I want him.
- What do you mean?
His life, in exchange for hers.
- His death.
- No. No, not death.
Life-- eternal life-- with me.
Have you forgotten your promise that I was to have eternal life?
There is death for Garth if he comes here-- death, not life... and destruction for you.
Get out.
- You won't wait long.
- No, not long.
Up there.
Goodnight, my friend.
Who's there?
[ Gunshot ]
- Where's Janet?
- Safe... so far.
- If you've harmed her--
- You're not in London now,
Dr Garth, with your police.
You're in Transylvania, in my castle.
Never mind all that.
Where is she?
- In there?
- Wait.
Get out of my way.
Very well.
[ Chattering ]
- [ Rattling Doorknob ]
- [ Sir Basil ] Rap on the door.
[ Both Speaking German ]
- What's he saying? What's he saying?
- He's gone to the castle.
- There isn't a moment to be lost.
- Well, let's get on with it.
- Hypnosis, eh?
- Something older... and more powerful.
Whatever it is,
I'll bring her out of it.
Like the other one... who died?
Her pulse is weak,
Dr Garth, growing weaker.
All your skill cannot help her now.
She's under a spell that can be broken only by me... or death.
Well, then, break it!
The great Dr Garth-- helpless...
- as she lies there dying before him?
- She's not dying.
I won't let her die.
Janet--
Your life for hers.
- What are you talking about?
- Remain here.
- Remain--
- Yes, with me among the undead-- one yourself, as only
I can make that possible-- never to know death, as men know it.
- You're insane!
- "Insane"?
To offer you eternal life?
I don't believe in your spells and your magic!
Then let your science save her, or--
- Or what?
- Or agree to remain here.
All right. Release her.
[ Gasps ]
[ Tyres Screeching ]
[ Gunshots ]
- Can it-- Is she?
- She's all right...
- And Countess Zaleska?
- Out there.
Janet, open your eyes.
Oh,Jeffrey!
There's your vampire, Sir Basil.
The arrow-- a wooden shaft through her heart... just as I drove the stake through his.
[ Sir Basil ]
The woman is beautiful.
[ Von Helsing ]
She was beautiful when she died-- a hundred years ago.
Hippolyta.
I wooed you with my sword and won your love doing you injuries.
But I will wed you in another key.
With pomp, with triumph and with reveling.

Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments.
Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth.
Turn melancholy forth to funerals.
The pale companion is not for our pomp.
Stand forth, Lysander.
With cunning did you steal my daughter's heart.
Turned her obedience, which is due to me, to stubborn harshness.
I am, my lord, beloved of beauteous Hermia.
But she is mine. I may dispose of her.
Which shall be either to Demetrius, or to her death.
According to our law, immediately provided in that case.
So will I die, my father.
Before I yield my maiden virtue up unto his lordship, whose unwished yoke my soul consents not to give sovereignty.
Relent, sweet Hermia.
[CHUCKLES]
Lysander, yield your crazed title to my certain right.
You have her father's love, Demetrius.
Let me have Hermia's.
- You marry him.
- Scornful Lysander.
True, he has my love.
And what is mine, my love shall give to him.
And she is mine, and all my right of her,
I hereby grant unto Demetrius.
My fortune is, my lord, as fairly ranked, if not with vantage, as Demetrius'.

Now, fair Hippolyta, our nuptial hour draws on apace.
Four happy days bring in another moon:
But, oh, methinks how slow this old moon wanes.
She lingers my desires.
Four days will quickly steep themselves in night.
Four nights will quickly dream away the time.
And then, the moon, like to a silver bow, new-bent in heaven, shall behold the night of our solemnities.
[FANFARE PLAYING]
EGEUS:
Happy be Theseus, our renowned duke.
Thanks, good Egeus.
What's the news with you?
Full of vexation am I and complain against my child, my daughter, Hermia.
Stand forth, Demetrius.
My noble lord, this man has my consent to marry her.
Stand forth, Lysander.
And, my gracious duke, this man has bewitch'd the bosom of my child.
You, you, Lysander, you have by moonlight at her window, sung with feigning voice, verses of feigning love.
Be it so.
She will not here before your grace, consent to marry with Demetrius.
I beg the ancient privilege of Athens, as she is mine, I may dispose of her.
For disobedience to her father's will, either to die the death or to give up forever the society of men.
What say you, Hermia?
Be advised, fair maid.
Demetrius is a worthy gentleman.
So is Lysander.
[THESEUS LAUGHS]
In himself, he is.
But in this case, lacking your father's voice, the other must be held the worthier.
I am, my lord, as nobly born as he, as well possess'd.
My love is more than his. Demetrius...
I'll declare it to his face.
Made love to Nedar's daughter, Helena, and won her soul.
And she, sweet lady, dotes, devoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry upon this fickle and inconstant man.
But I beseech your grace that I may know that the worst that may befall me in this case if I refuse to wed Demetrius.
Either to fit your fancies to your father's will, or else the law of Athens yields you up, and mark, by no means may we alter it.
To death, or to avow a single life.
So will l...
[SOBBING]
Hermia.
The course of true love never did run smooth.
Oh, spite.
To choose love by another's eyes.
Hear me, Hermia.
And if you love me, then steal forth your father's house tomorrow night.
[GASPS]
To the wood, a league without the town, will I go with you.
I have a widow aunt, a dowager from Athens is her house removed seven leagues.
There, gentle Hermia, may I marry you.
And to that place, the sharp Athenian law cannot pursue us.
Keep word, Lysander.
We must starve our sight from lovers' food till morrow deep midnight.
Oh, my good Lysander.

First, good Peter Quince, say what the play treats on.
Then read the names of the actors and so grow on to a point.
- Answer as I call you.
- Masters, spread yourselves.
Answer as I call you.
-"Nick Bottom, the Weaver."
- Ready. 
Name what part I am for and proceed.
Nick Bottom, you are set down for... Pyramus.
[LAUGHING]
I play Pyramus. I play Pyramus.
I play Pyramus.
What is Pyramus?
[ALL LAUGHING]
A lover or a tyrant?
A lover... that kills himself most gallantly for love.
[MAN GIGGLING]
A lover.
A lover.
BOTTOM: If I do it, let the audience look to their eyes.
I will move storms:
[IMITATES WIND HOWLING]
[RATTLING SAW]
Yet my chief humor is for a tyrant.
I could play Ercles rarely, or a part to tear a cat in, to make all split.
"Francis Flute."
The raging rocks and shivering shocks shall break the locks of prison gates.
And Phibbus' car shall shine from far and make and mar the foolish fates.
[MAN GIGGLES]
Francis Flute.
This is Ercles' vein, a tyrant's vein.
A lover is more, uh, mm... condoling.
[GIBBERING SILLILY]
Francis Flute, the Bellows-mender!
FLUTE:
Nay.
Here, Peter Quince.
Flute...
Flute, you must take... Thisbe on you.
Thisbe?
What is Thisbe? A wandering knight?
A wandering knight.
It is the lady that Pyramus must love.
[MAN GIGGLES]
A lady.
Nay, faith, let not me play a woman.
- Flute.
- Nay, I have a beard coming.
That's all one. You shall play it in a mask, and you may speak as small as you will.
[HIGH VOICE]
Pyramus, Pyra...
[GIGGLING]
As small as you will.
If I may hide my face, let me play Thisbe too.
- No.
- I will speak in a monstrous little voice.
- No.
- Listen, listen.
[HIGH VOICE] Oh, Pyramus, my lover dear.
- No.
Thy Thisbe dear, and lady dear.
No, no!
No.
You must play Pyramus.
And, Flute, you Thisbe.
Well... proceed.
-"Robin Starveling, the Tailor."
- Here, Peter Quince, here, Peter Quince. 
You must play...
Thisbe's mother.
[CHUCKLING]
"Tom Snout, the Tinker."
Here, Peter Quince.
[GIGGLES]
You, Pyramus' father.
[GIGGLING]
Myself, Thisbe's father.
[GIGGLING]
Snug, the joiner.
You, the lion's part.
And I hope here is a play fitted.
Have you the lion's part written?
Pray you, if it be, give it me, for I am slow of study.
You may do it extempore, for it is nothing but roaring.
[RO ARING]
Let me play the lion too.
I will roar you, that I will do any man's heart good to hear me:
[RO ARS]
I will roar, that I will make the duke say, "Let him roar again!"
[RO ARS]
"Let him roar again."
[BOTTOM & SNUG RO ARING]
If you should do it too terribly, you would fright the duchess and the ladies, that they would shriek, and that were enough to hang us.
But I will aggravate my voice so that I will roar you as gently as any sucking dove.
[RO ARING GENTLY]
I will roar you an't were any nightingale.
[CAWING]
You can play no part but Pyramus.
Oh, Pyramus.
For Pyramus is a sweet-faced man.
A proper man, as one shall see in a summer's day.
A most lovely gentleman-like man.
Therefore, you must needs play Pyramus.
Well...
I will undertake it.
QUINCE:
But, masters, here are your parts.
STARVELING: Thisbe's mother,
Thisbe's mother, Thisbe's mother.
BOTTOM: Pyramus. Pyramus.
- Thisbe's mother, Thisbe's mother.
- And I am to entreat you,
- Oh, Thisbe's mother. request you and desire you, to con them by tomorrow night.
And let us by moonlight to the palace wood a mile without the town.
There will we rehearse for if we meet in the city, we shall be dogged with company and our devices known.
We will meet.
And there we may rehearse most obscenely and courageously.
Take pains, be perfect.
MEN:
Adieu. 
[HOOTING]
[CRO AKING]
[SQUEALING]
[ALL SINGING GENTLY]
[TRILLING]
How, now, Spirit!
[SPIRIT GIGGLES]
Whither wander you?
[SINGING]
Over hill, over dale
Through bush, through brier
Over park, over pale
Through flood, through fire
I do wander everywhere
Swifter than the moon's sphere
And I serve the Queen of Fairies
[TRILLING]
Are not you he that frights the maidens of the village?
[LAUGHS]
Thou speakest aright.
I am that merry wanderer of the night.
I jest to Oberon and make him smile when I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile...
[NEIGHING]
...neighing in a likeness of a filly foal.
[NEIGHING]
[LAUGHING]
The king doth keep his revels here tonight.
Take heed the queen, come not within his sight.
For Oberon is passing fell and wrath because that she as her attendant hath a lovely boy stolen from an Indian king.
[BOTH LAUGHING]
She never had so sweet a changeling.
But jealous Oberon would have the child knight of his train to trace the forest wild.
But she, perforce, withholds the loved boy crowns him with flowers and makes him all her joy.
[BOTH LAUGHING]
[ALL GIGGLING]
[LAUGHING]
[GRUMBLING]
How, now, here comes Oberon!
[ALL SHRIEKING]
Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania.
What, jealous Oberon.
Fairies, skip hence.
I have forsworn his bed and company.
[FAIRIES TRILLING]
Tarry, rash wanton.
Do you amend it then?
It lies in you.
Why should Titania cross her Oberon?
I do but beg a little changeling boy to be my henchman.
[FAIRIES SHRIEKING]
Set your heart at rest.
The fairy land buys not the child of me.
[FAIRIES SIGH]
His mother was a votaress of my order.
And for her sake, do I rear up her boy, and for her sake, I will not part with him.
[FAIRIES GIGGLING]
How long within this wood intend you stay?
Perchance till after
Theseus' wedding day.
[FAIRIES GIGGLING]
If you will patiently dance in our round and see our moonlight revels, go with us.
If not, shun me, and I will spare your haunts.
Give me that boy, and I will go with thee.
Not for thy fairy kingdom.
Fairies, away.
[PUCK LAUGHING]
My gentle Puck, come hither.
[PUCK LAUGHING]
Fetch me that flower, the herb I shew'd thee once.
Before milk white, now purple with love's wound, and maidens call it love in idleness.
The juice of it on sleeping eyelids laid will make or man or woman madly dote upon the next live creature that it sees.
Fetch me this herb.
And be thou here again ere the leviathan can swim a league.
[PUCK LAUGHING]
I'll put a girdle round about the Earth in 40 minutes!
Fair love, you faint with wandering in the wood.
And... to speak truth...
[CHUCKLES]
I have forgot our way.
[BOTH LAUGHING]
[SINGING]
I mean, that my heart unto yours is knit
So that but one heart
We can make of it
Two bosoms
Interchained with an oath
So then two bosoms
And a single troth
You told me they were stolen into this wood.
And here am l, like wood within this wood, because I cannot meet my Hermia.
[SIGHS]
I will overhear their conference.
I love you not, therefore pursue me not.
Where are Lysander and fair Hermia?
The one I'll slay, the other slayeth me.
You draw me, you hard-hearted adamant.
Give up your power to draw, and I shall have no power to follow you.
Do I entice you? Do I speak you fair?
Or, rather, do I not in plainest truth tell you I do not, nor I cannot love you?
And even for that do I love you the more.
[HUFFS]
I'll run from you and hide me in the brakes.
And leave you to the mercy of wild beasts.
The wildest has not such a heart as you.
If you follow me, you may be sure that I shall do you mischief in the wood.
Ay, in the temple, in the town, in the field, you do me mischief.
We cannot fight for love, as men may do.
We should be wooed and were not made to woo.
- You're...
[GROWLS]
I'll follow you... and make a heaven of hell.
To die upon the hand I love so well.
Fare thee well, nymph.
Before he leaves this grove, thou shalt fly him, and he shall seek thy love.
[ALL SINGING CHEERFULLY]
Oh, Peter Quince.
- Peter Quince.
- What say you, bully Bottom?
There are things in this, uh, comedy of Pyramus and Thisbe
- That will never please.
[GRO ANS]
First, Pyramus must draw a sword to kill himself.
- And?
- And which the ladies cannot abide.
[MAN CHUCKLES]
How answer you that?
[CHUCKLES]
By heavens, a grave mistake.
I believe we must leave the killing out, when all is done.
Not a whit.
I have a device to make all well.
[LAUGHS]
Write me a prologue.
And let the prologue seem to say, we will do no harm with our swords, and that Pyramus is not killed indeed.
[CHUCKLES]
And then, for the more better assurance, tell them that l, Pyramus, am not Pyramus.
MEN:
Huh?
But Bottom the weaver.
This will put them out of fear.
Well, we will have such a prologue.
Then, there's another thing.
- We must have a wall in the great chamber.
- A wall?
For Pyramus and Thisbe, says the story, did talk through the chink of a wall.
But you can never bring in a wall.
What say you, Bottom?
Some man or other must present wall.
Let him have some plaster or some loam, or rough-cast about him to signify wall.
And let him hold his fingers thus.
And through this cranny shall Pyramus and Thisbe whisper.
If that may be, then all is well.
Welcome, wanderer.
Hast thou the flower there?
- Here it is!
- I pray thee, give it me.
I know a bank
Where the wild thyme blows
Where oxlips
And the nodding violet grows
Quite over-canopied
With luscious woodbine
With sweet musk-roses
And with eglantine
There sleeps Titania
Sometime of the night
Lull'd in these flowers
With dances and delight
And with the juice of this
I'll streak her eyes
And make her full of hateful fantasies
[CHUCKLES]
The next thing then
She waking looks upon
She shall pursue it
With the soul of love
And before I take this charm off
From her sight
I'll make her render up this boy to me
Take thou some of it and seek through this grove.
A sweet Athenian lady is in love with a disdainful youth.
Anoint his eyes.
But do it when the next thing he espies may be the lady.
Thou shalt know him by the Athenian garments he hath on.
Effect it with some care so he may prove more fond of her than she is of her love.
Look thou we meet before the first cock crows.
Fear not, my lord, your servant shall do so.
Sing me now asleep.
Then to your duties go, and let me rest.
[SINGING]
Philomel, with melody
Sing in our sweet lullaby
Good night, with lullaby
FAIRIES:
Never harm, nor spell, nor charm
Come our lovely lady nigh
Good night, with lullaby
ALL:
Weaving spiders, come not here
Hence, you long-legg'd spinners, hence
Beetles black, approach not near
Worm do no offense
Philomel, with melody
Sing in our sweet lullaby
Good night, with lullaby
What thou seest when thou dost wake
Do it for thy truelove take
Be it leopard, cat, or bear
Wolf or boar with bristled hair
In thine eye that shall appear
[CHUCKLES]
When thou wakest, it is thy dear
[OBERON LAUGHS]
[SINGING]
Through the forest have I gone
Have I gone, have I gone
But Athenian found I none
Found l, found I none
On whose eyes I am to prove
Am to prove, am to prove
This flower's force in stirring love
Stirring
Stirring
[CHUCKLES]
Love
[LAUGHS]
We'll rest us, Hermia.
If you think it good.
And bathe here for the comfort of the day.
Be it so, Lysander.
Find you out a bed.
For l, upon this bank, will rest my head.
One turf shall serve as pillow for us both.
One heart, one bed, two bosoms and one troth.
Nay, good Lysander.
For my sake, my dear, lie further off yet.
Do not lie so near.
Oh, take the sense, sweet, of my innocence!
Then by your side no bedroom me deny.
For lying so, Hermia, I do not lie.
[BOTH LAUGH]
Lysander riddles very prettily.
But, gentle friend... for love and courtesy, lie further off.
In human modesty, such separation, as may well be said, becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid.
[HERMIA LAUGHING]
So far be distant.
And good night, sweet friend.
Your love ne'er alter till your sweet life end.
Amen, amen, to that fair prayer, say I.
And then end life when I end Ioyalty.
Here is my bed.
Sleep give you all his rest.
With half that wish, the wisher's eyes be pressed.
[LYSANDER GRUNTS]
[SINGING]
Through the forest have I gone
Have I gone, have I gone
But... 
[GIGGLING]
Night and silence. Who is here?
[LAUGHING]
Dress of Athens he doth wear.
This is he, my master said.
Despised of the Athenian maid.
[LAUGHING]
And here's the maiden, sleeping sound.
On the damp and dirty ground.
Pretty soul.
She dares not lie near this lack-Iove.
Fool.
[LYSANDER GRO ANS]
Fool, upon thy eyes I throw
All the power this charm doth hold
When thou wak'st, let love forbid
Sleep his seat on thy eyelid
So awake when I am gone
For I must go to Oberon
Ho, there!
Hast thou charmed the Athenians eyes with the love juice, as I did bid thee do?
I took him sleeping. That is finished too.
And the Athenian woman by his side.
So when he wakes, by him she must be eyed.
What has't thou done?
Thou has't mistaken quite.
And laid the love juice on some true love's sight.
Believe me, King of Shadows, I mistook.
Did not you tell me I should know the man by the Athenian garments he had on?
[PUCK LAUGHS]
And so far am I glad this so did sort.
For this, their jangling, I esteem a sport.
[WHOOPING]
[BEAR GROWLS]
[HELENA SHRIEKS]
[TEARFULLY] When beasts that meet me run away for fear.
It is no wonder that Demetrius, should like a monster, fly my presence thus.
But who is here?
Lysander!
On the ground. Dead or asleep?
I see no blood, no wound.
Lysander, if you live, good sir, awake!
[LYSANDER GRO ANS]
Lysander, there's...
There was a...
And run through fire
I will for your sweet sake.
Transparent Helena!
Nature shows art, that through your bosom makes me see your heart.
Do not say so, Lysander, say not so.
- Yet Hermia...
- Not Hermia, but Helena I love.
Who will not change a raven for a dove?
The will of man is by his reason swayed.
And reason says you are the worthier maid.
Things growing are not ripe until their season.
So l, being young, till now ripe not to reason.
Good troth, you do me wrong.
Good sooth, you do so in such disdainful manner me to woo.
- But, fare you well.
- Helena!
I must confess,
I thought you lord of true gentleness.
- Helena.
- Oh, that a lady by one man refused
[TEARFULLY] should by another therefore be abused.
Her...
[WHISPERING]
Hermia, sleep you there.
And never may you come Lysander near.
Now, all my powers address your love and might.
To honor Helena, and to be her knight!
[LAUGHS]
Help me, Lysander!
[SOBBING]
Do your best to pluck this crawling serpent from my breast.
[SIGHING]
Ay, me, for pity.
What a dream was here.
Lysander, look how I do shake with fear.
I thought a serpent ate my heart away.
And you sat smiling at my agony.
Lysander...
What?
Not here?
Lysander!
Lysander!
Oh, dear heart, speak!
Oh, dear heart, speak!
I swoon almost with fear.
No!
No!
Lord, then I will perceive that you are gone.
Either death or you I'll find immediately!
Lysander!
Lysander!
Lysander!
Hermia!
Demetrius!
Demetrius!
[SOBBING]
Helena! Helena!
Helena!
Lysander!
- Hermia, Hermia!
- Hermia!
Demetrius!
Helena! Helena!
Lord...
[LAUGHING]
...what fools these mortals be!
[LAUGHING]
[ALL WHISTLING]
Here.
Here's a marvelous convenient place for our rehearsal.
Ah!
[OTHERS CHUCKLE]
[LAUGHING]
[FAIRY SQUEALS]
This plot shall be our stage.
This Hawthorne-brake our tiring-house.
There is a play on foot.
I'll be the audience.
An actor too, perhaps, if I see cause.
[LAUGHING]
Come, sit down, every mother's son, and rehearse your part.
And we will do it in action as will do it before the duke.
Pyramus, you begin.
[CHUCKLES]
Well...
I begin.
Oh, Thisnay!
And when you have spoken your speech...
- Then I stop.
- No, no!
- Well, then I go on.
- No, no!
Then you enter into that break.
And so every one according to his cue.
QUINCE:
Thisbe, stand forth.
Speak, Pyramus.
-Oh, Thisnay, the flowers...
- "Oh, Thisbe."
-"Thisnay."
- "Thisbe."
-"Nay."
- "Be."
-"Nay."
- "Be!"
This...
This...
This... nebee.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[LAUGHING]
The flowers of odious savors sweet.
"Odorous," "odorous."
Odorous, odorous.
The flowers od...
The flowers of odorous savors sweet.
Oh, Thisbe, the flowers of odorous savors sweet.
So hath thy breath.
Oh, Thisbe.
My dearest Thisbe dear.
But, hark...
[COUGHING]
QUINCE:
Oh, no, Bottom.
Bottom.
Thisnay.
Thisbe.
But, hark.
[COUGHS]
A voice.
Stay you but here a while, and by and by...
I will to you appear.
Into that break!
Most radiant Pyramus...
Most radiant Pyramus!
Must I speak now?
[SNOUT CHUCKLING]
Ay, indeed, must you, for you must understand he goes but to see a noise that he heard, and he's to come again.
If I were fair Thisbe,
I were only thine...
I were only...
Most radiant Pyramus, most lily-white of hue...
Most lily-white of hue.
Of color like the red rose on triumphant brier.
Most briskly juvenal and eke...
Eke.
Eke most lovely Jew as true as truest horse that yet would never tire.
I'll meet thee, Pyramus, at Ninny's tomb.
- Ninny's?
- Ninny's.
- Ninny's.
- Ninny's.
Ninus' tomb, man!
Ninus' tomb, man!
But you must not speak that yet.
But you must not speak that yet.
[GRO ANS]
[GRO ANS]
That you answer to Pyramus.
That you answer to Pyramus.
[QUINCE GRO ANS]
You speak all your part at once, cues and all!
You speak all your part at once, cues...
I won't play anymore.
I won't play.
[SQUEALS]
[BLABBERING]
QUINCE:
Pyramus! Your cue is passed.
It's "never tire."
If I were fair Thisbe, I were only thine.
If I were fair Thisbe.
If I were fair Thisbe, I were only thine.
Oh, me.
Oh, monstrous.
Strange.
[SNOUT CHUCKLES]
We are haunted.
Pray, masters.
Fly, masters.
[ALL SCREAMING]
I'll follow you.
I'll lead you about, around, through bog, through bush, through break, through brier.
Sometime a hound I'll be.
[YELPS]
[BARKING]
A hog!
Murder! Murder!
Starveling.
[PUCK SCREECHES]
Help me!
[YELLING]
[LAUGHING]
[PANTING]
I won't play anymore.
Why do they run away?
[MO ANS]
I see their knavery.
This is to make an ass of me, to fright me if they could.
But I will not stir from this place, do what they will.
I will walk up and down here, and I will sing, so they shall hear I am not afraid.
[CLEARING THRO AT]
[SINGING]
The ousel cock so black of hue
With orange-tawny bill... 
The throstle with his note so true
The wren with little... 
Oh, me.
[SOBBING]
[CHUCKLES]
The finch, the sparrow and the lark
The plain-song cuckoo gray
Whose note full many a man doth mark
And dares not answer nay
What angel wakes me from my flowery bed?
I pray thee, gentle mortal, sing again.
[SOBBING]
Mine ear is much enamor'd of thy note.
And so is mine eye enthralled by thy shape.
And thy fair manliness and grace doth move me on the first view... to say, to swear, I love thee.
Methinks, mistress, you should have little reason for that.
And yet, to say the truth... reason and love keep little company together nowadays.
[BOTH LAUGH]
Thou art as wise as thou art beautiful.
Not so, not so.
Sing again.
[SINGING]
The ousel cock so black of hue
So black of hue
With orange-tawny bill
BOTH:
The throstle with his note so true
The wren with little quill
If I had wit enough to get out of this wood,
I'd have enough to serve mine own turn.
Out of this wood do not desire to go.
Thou shalt remain here, whether thou wilt or no.
I am a spirit of no common rate.
The summer still doth tend upon my state.
And I do love thee.
Therefore, go with me.
No.
I'll give thee fairies to attend on thee.
Peaseblossom.
Cobweb. Moth.
And Mustardseed.
PEASEBLOSSOM [SINGING]: Me
COBWEB [SINGING]: And I
MOTH [SINGING]: And I
Where shall we go? 
Be kind and courteous to this gentleman.
Hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes, feed him with apricots and dewberries with purple grapes, green figs and mulberries, the honey-bags steal from the humblebees and for night candles, crop their waxen thighs, and light them at the fiery glowworm's eyes to have my love to bed and to arise.
Nod to him, elves, and do him courtesies.
ELVES:
Hail, mortal, hail!
Hail! Hail!
[BOTTOM BRAYS]
[ALL LAUGHING]
[SOBBING]
I greet your worships most heartily.
I beseech your worship's name.
Cobweb.
Oh. Cobweb.
- Bottom.
COBWEB: Bottom.
I desire more of your acquaintance, good Master Cobweb.
Your name, honest gentleman?
Peaseblossom.
Your name, I beseech you, sir?
Mustardseed.
Oh. Mustardseed.
[LAUGHING]
I desire more of your acquaintance, good Master Mustardseed.
[WHINNIES]
Oh. Oh!
[LAUGHING]
The moon... methinks, looks with a watery eye.
And when she weeps... weeps every little flower... lamenting some enforced chastity.
[FAIRIES GIGGLING]
[SOBBING]
Tie up my love's tongue, bring him silently.
Come, wait upon him, lead him to my bower.
[SOBBING]
[OBERON YELLING]
[LAUGHING]
This falls out better than I could devise.
Have you slain him, then?
You spend your passion on a foolish mood.
I am not guilty of Lysander's blood, nor is he dead, for all that I can tell.
Stand close. This is the same Athenian.
This is the woman, but not this the man.
I beg you, tell me then if he is well.
And if I could, what should I get therefore?
[HUFFING]
A privilege never to see me more, so from your hated presence shall I go.
See me no more, whether he be dead or no.
[SCOFFS]
There is no following her in this fierce vein.
Here therefore for a while I will remain.
[PUCK SQUEALS]
From thy mistaking must perforce ensue some true love turn'd and not a false turn'd true.
Then fate o'er-rules, that, one man holding troth, a million fail, confounding oath on oath.
About the wood go swifter than the wind, and Helena of Athens look thou find.
By some illusion see thou bring her here.
I'll charm his eyes against she do appear.
I go! I go!
Look how I go, swifter than the arrow from the Tartar's bow.
Flower of this purple dye
Sink in apple of his eye
When his love he doth espy
Let her shine in glory high
When thou wakest, if there she be
Beg of her for remedy
[LAUGHING]
Captain of our fairy band,
Helena is here at hand
And the youth, mistook by me...
[LAUGHING]
...pleading for a lover's fee.
Stand aside. The noise they make will cause Demetrius to awake.
Then will two at once woo one.
That must needs be sport alone, and those things do best please me that befall preposterously.
Look, when I vow, I weep, and vows so born, in their nativity all truth appears.
- These oaths are Hermia's.
- Hermia's?
Love you her no more?
I had no judgment when to her I swore.
Nor none, in my mind, while you thus implore.
Demetrius loves her, and he loves not you.
[HELENA GASPS]
Demetrius, l...
[LAUGHS]
Helen, goddess, nymph.
Perfect, divine.
To what, my love, shall I compare your eyne?
Crystal is muddy.
Oh, how ripe in show your lips, those kissing cherries, tempting grow.
0, spite! 0, hell!
I see you all are bent to set against me for your merriment.
If you were civil and knew courtesy, you would not do me thus much injury.
MEN:
Helena.
You are both are rivals and love Hermia.
[MEN SCOFF]
And now, both rivals to mock Helena.
A fine exploit, a manly enterprise.
[TEARFULLY] To conjure tears up in a poor maid's eyes.
- Helena. Huh?
- You are unkind, Demetrius.
Be not so, for you love Hermia.
This you know, I know. l...
And here, with all goodwill, with all my heart.
Of Hermia's love, I yield you up my part.
- And yours of Helena's to me bequeath.
[DEMETRIUS SCOFFING]
For her I love, and will love till my death.
Lysander, keep your Hermia,
I want none.
If once I loved her, all that love is gone.
[LAUGHS]
My heart to her but as a guest sojourned.
And now, to Helena is it home returned.
There to remain.
Helena, it is not so.
Disparage not the faith you do not know.
- Hermia.
- Yes, Lysander.
Oh, Lysander.
Oh, my ear.
I thank it brought me to your sound.
But why unkindly did you leave me so?
Why should he stay, whom love does press to go?
What love could press Lysander from my side?
Lysander's love, that would not let him bide.
Why seek you me?
[LAUGHS]
Could this not make you know the hate
I bare you made me leave you so?
Oh, you speak not as you think.
- Here, it cannot be.
- Lo, she is one of this confederacy.
Now I perceive.
They have joined up all three to fashion this false sport in spite of me.
Injurious Hermia. Most ungrateful maid.
To join with men in scorning your poor friend.
It is not friendly, 'tis not maidenly.
I understand not what you mean by this.
Go on, persever, counterfeit sad looks.
Make mouths upon me when I turn my back.
Wink at each at other.
Hold the sweet jest up.
But fare you well.
MEN:
Helena!
'Tis partly my own fault, which death or absence soon shall remedy.
MEN:
Helena.
[MEN BLOW NOSE]
Stay, gentle Helena. Hear my excuse.
My love, my life, my soul, fair Helena.
[LAUGHING]
[LAUGHING]
Oh, excellent.
Sweet, do not scorn her so.
If she cannot entreat, I can compel.
You can compel no more than she entreat.
Your threats have no more strength than her weak prayers.
Helena, I love you. By my life I do.
I say I love you more than he can do.
If you say so, withdraw and prove it too.
- Come. Quick.
- Come. Quick.
- Come quick!
- Quick come!
[ALL CHATTERING]
- Lysander, to what leads all this?
- Away, you Ethiope.
[ALL CHATTER]
Am not I Hermia? Are not you Lysander?
Be certain, it is no jest that I do hate you.
And love Helena.
Oh, me.
You juggler.
You canker blossom.
You thief of love.
What? Have you come by night and stolen my love's heart from him?
Fine, I'faith! Have you no modesty?
No maiden shame?
No touch of bashfulness?
Why, will you tear impatient answers from my gentle tongue?
Fie, fie, you counterfeit, you puppet, you.
- Puppet?
- Puppet!
Puppet.
So that way goes the game.
Now I perceive that she has made compare between our statures.
She has urged her height.
And with her personage, her tall personage.
Her height! Her height!
She has prevailed with him.
And are you grown so high in his esteem because I am so dwarfish?
And so low?
How low am l, you painted maypole?
Speak. How low am I?
I'm not yet so low but that my nails can reach into your eyes.
[HELENA GASPS]
[HERMIA SQUEALING]
[HERMIA SCREAMS]
[LAUGHS]
I pray you, though you mock me, gentlemen, let her not hurt me.
I was never cursed,
I have no gift at all in shrewishness.
Let her not strike me.
You may think because she is something lower than myself that I can match her.
Lower, hark, again.
[TEARFULLY]
Let me go, let me go.
Why, get you gone.
Who is it that hinders you?
A foolish heart, that I leave here behind.
What, with Lysander?
With Demetrius.
[SCOFFS]
Be not afraid.
She shall not harm you, Helena.
No, sir, she shall not, though you take her part.
Oh, when she's angry, she is keen and shrewd.
She was a vixen when she went to school.
And though she be but little, she is fierce.
Little again? Nothing but low and little.
Low and little.
Let me come to her.
Get you gone, you dwarf, you minimus, you bead.
You acorn.
[DEMETRIUS COUGHS]
- You're too officious, sir.
- Sir.
Sir, sir!
In her behalf that scorns your services, let her alone. Speak not of Helena...
- Helena!
- Take not her part.
For if you should offer the very slightest show of love to her, you shall regret it.
Mmm, now she holds me not.
Now follow if you dare to try whose right of yours or mine is most in Helena.
Follow, ha! Nay, I'll go with you, cheek by jowl.
[LAUGHS]
You, mistress, are the cause of all this strife.
Nay, go not back.
I will not trust you, I.
Nor longer stay in your cursed company.
Your hands than mine are quicker for a fray.
My legs are longer, though, to run away.
You juggler! You thief of love!
[PUCK LAUGHING]
Thou see'st these lovers seek a place to fight.
Hie, therefore, Puck, overcast the night with drooping fog.
[PUCK LAUGHS]
Go lead these men astray, so one come not within the other's way.
Like to Lysander sometime frame thy tongue, then stir Demetrius up with bitter wrong.
And sometime rail thou like Demetrius.
Then crush this herb into Lysander's eye to take from thence all error with his might.
When they next wake, all this derision shall seem a dream and fruitless vision.
Up and down, up and down.
I will lead them up and down.
I am feared in field and town.
Goblin, lead them up and down.
Demetrius!
Demetrius!
- Demetrius!
- Lysander!
Speak again.
You runaway.
You coward.
Are you fled?
You coward.
Are you bragging to the stars?
Telling the bushes that you look for wars and wilt not come?
Demetrius! Follow my voice.
We'll try no manhood here.
Lysander.
Where are you, proud Demetrius?
Speak you now.
Here, villain, drawn and ready.
- Come you now.
- I'll be with you straight.
Follow me then to a plainer ground.
Lysander.
PUCK: You juggler, you thief of love, you painted maypole.
Little, acorn, puppet.
Lysander.
Lysander.
BOTH:
Ah...
He goes before me and still dares me on.
BOTH: When I come where he calls, then he is... gone.
[BOTH HUFF]
And the villain is much lighter-heeled than I.
I followed fast but faster he did fly.
[BOTH SIGH]
- Here will I rest me.
- Here will I rest me.
- Come, thou gentle day.
- Come, thou gentle day.
For if but once... you show me your grey light,
I'll find Demetrius.
- And revenge this spite.
- Spite.
[BOTH MUTTERING]
[CHUCKLES]
Oh, faintness constrains me to measure out my length on this cold bed.
By day's approach
Iook to be visited by day's approach.
[BABBLING]
[LAUGHS]
HELENA [TEARFULLY]: 0h, weary night.
PUCK [HIGH VOICE]: 0h, weary night.
- 0h, long and tedious night.
- 0h, long and tedious night.
Abate thy hours... that I may back to Athens by daylight.
For fear that my poor company detest.
[LAUGHS]
Yet but three?
Count one more.
Two of both kinds make up four.
[LAUGHS]
Here she comes, cursed and sad.
Cupid is a knavish lad.
Thus to make poor females mad.
[HERMIA SOBBING]
[SCREAMING]
[LAUGHING]
[SOBBING]
Never so weary.
So lost in woe.
Bedabbled with the dew and torn with briars.
My legs can keep no pace with my desire.
Here will I rest me till the break of day.
Heaven shield Lysander if they mean a fray.
[LAUGHS]
[CHUCKLING]
On the ground, sleep sound
I'll apply to your eye
Gentle lover remedy
When thou wakest, then thou takest
True delight in the sight
Of thy former lady's eye
And the country proverb known
That every man should take his own
In your waking shall be shown
Jack shall have Jill
Naught shall go ill
The man shall have his mare again
And all shall be well
What? Will thou hear some music, my sweet love?
I have a reasonable good ear for music.
[CLEARS THRO AT]
[SINGING] The aldercock so black of you

Let us have the tongues and the bones.
The tongues and the bones.
[PLAYING CHEERFUL MELOD Y]
Scratch my head, Peaseblossom.
Where's Monsieur Mustardseed?
MUSTARDSEED:
Ready.
[BOTTOM MO ANING]
I must to the barber's, monsieur.
For I feel I am marvelous hairy about the face.
And I am such a tender ass, if my hair do but tickle me, I must scratch.
But say, sweet love, what thou desirest to eat?
Truly, a peck of provender.
I could munch your good dry oats.
Methinks I have a great desire for a bottle of hay.
Hay, hay, hay.
[SINGING] Good hay, sweet hay,
Has no fellow
[LAUGHING]
[BRAYING]
See'st thou this sweet sight?
I pray you, let none of your people stir me.
I have an exposition of sleep come upon me.
[ALL GIGGLING]
Shh. Faeries, begone.
[SINGING]
Sleep thou, sleep thou
I will thee wind in my arms
Sleep thou, sleep thou
So doth the woodbine, the honeysuckle
Sweet and gently entwist
The ivy so enrings
[BRAYING PLEASANTLY]
The barky fingers of the elm
As I
Will wind thee in my arms
Sleep thou, sleep thou
Oh, how I love thee
Oh, how I dote on thee
[BOTTOM SINGING PEACEFULLY]
Her dotage now I do begin to pity.
Now I have the boy.
I will undo this hateful imperfection of her eyes.
My fairy lord, this must be done with haste.
For night's swift dragons cut the clouds full fast.
[PUCK LAUGHING]
Be as thou wast wont to be
See as thou wast wont to see
Dian's bud o'er Cupid's flower
Hath such force and blessed power
My Titania, my sweet queen, now awake.
My Oberon.
What visions have I seen.
Methought...
I was enamored of... an ass.
[LAUGHS]
There lies your love.
Oh.
How came these things to pass?
0, mine eyes do loathe his visage now.
Come, my queen.
Take hands with me.
Now thou and I are new in amity.
Fairy king, attend and mark.
[BIRD SINGING]
Hmm, I do hear the morning lark.
My gentle Puck, take this transformed scalp from off the head of this Athenian.
So that he awaking when the other do may all to Athens back again repair.
And think no more of this night's accidents but as the fierce vexation of a dream.
Then, my queen, in silence sad, trip we after night's shade.
We the globe can compass soon swifter than the wandering moon.
Come, my lord, and in our flight, tell me how it came this night that I sleeping here was found with these mortals on the ground.
When thou wak'st, with thine own fool's eyes peep.
[LAUGHS]
[PUCK GRUNTING]

I have had... a most rare vision.
I have had a dream.
Past the wit of man to say what dream it was.
Methought I was...
And methought I had...
[CHUCKLES]
Man is but an ass.
[BIRD SINGING]

Man is but an ass if he go about to expound this dream.

The eye of man has not heard, the ear of man has not seen, man's hand is not able to taste, his tongue to conceive nor his heart to report... what my dream was.
And I will get Peter Quince to write a ballad of this dream.
It shall be called "Bottom's Dream."
Because it has no bottom.
And... I will sing it in the latter end of our play before the duke.
And perhaps to make it the more gracious...
I shall sing it after death.
[SINGING] What methought I was
And what methought I had
What methought I was
And methought I had
[PLAYING BOLD FANFARE]
[ALL LAUGHING]
I beg the law, the law upon her head, my lord.
Good morrow, friends.
Fair lovers, you are fortunately met.
- My consent, my lord.
- Egeus, I will overbear your will.
For in the temple by and by with us, these couples shall eternally be knit.
Come, my Hippolyta.
[GIGGLES]
"We come not to offend, but with goodwill to show our... Our simple skills."
We come not to offend, but with goodwill to show our simple skills.
Masters, the duke is at the temple.
There were two or three more lords and ladies married.
[GIGGLES]
Have you sent to Bottom's house?
Is he come home yet?
If he cannot be heard of, without doubt he is... transported.
Where are all these lads?
Where are these hearts?
Bottom!
Oh, most courageous day!
Oh, most happy hour.
It is with our goodwill.
[ALL LAUGHING]
Masters, I will tell you of... wonders.
Let us hear, sweet Bottom.
[DONKEY BRAYS]
Not a word of me.
Get your costumes together, meet presently at the palace.
- Away. Go, away.
MAN: Come on.
[HORNS PLAYING GRAND MELOD Y]
[CHORUS SINGING JO YFULLY]
These things seem small and undistinguishable.
Like far-off mountains turned into clouds.
It seems to me that yet we sleep, we dream.
'Tis strange, my Theseus, what these lovers speak of.
Lovers and madmen have such seething brains.
Such wild imaginings that apprehend more than cool reason ever comprehends.
The lunatic, the lover and the poet are of imagination all compact.
The poet's eye, in fine frenzy rolling, doth glance from heaven to Earth, from Earth to heaven.
And his imagination bodies forth the forms of things unknown.
The poet's pen turns them into shapes and gives to airy nothing a local habitation and a name.
But all the story of the night told over and all their minds transfigured so together tells more to us than fancy's images.
Come now, what masques, what dances shall we have?
Where is our usual manager of mirth?
What revels are in hand?
"A tedious brief scene of young Pyramus and his love Thisbe. 
Very tragical mirth." Ha! 
No, my noble lord, it is not for you.
What are they that do play it?
Hard-handed men that work in Athens here who never labor'd in their minds till now.
And we will hear it. Go, bring them in.
[HORNS PLAY CHEERFUL FANFARE]
The actors are at hand.
And by their show, you shall know all that you are like to know.
For all the rest, let... uh, Lion...
Moonshine...
Wall...
Wall, wall, wall.
[GIGGLES]
And lovers twain... at large discourse, while here they do remain.
[ALL LAUGHING]
[WHISPERING]
In this same interlude.
Oh, yeah.
In th... This same interlude, it doth befall
[GIGGLING] that l, uh, one Snout by name, present.
[GIGGLING]
- Uh...
- Wall.
A wall.
[GIGGLING]
Uh, and such a...
- Wall.
- Wall.
Such a wall I'd have you think had in it a cranny hole or a...
QUINCE: Chink.
- Chink.
- Chink.
- Chink. Chink.
[PEOPLE LAUGH]
Chink. Chink.
Through which the lovers, Pyramus and Thisbe, did whisper often very secretly.
[GIGGLING]
Shh!
Yeah, I know.
This loam, this rough cast, this stone, doth show that I am that same.
QUINCE:
Wall. Wall. Wall.
Wall. Wall, wall, wall.
The truth is so and this cranny is...
This cranny is...
This cranny is right and sinister through which the fearful lovers are to whisper.
[LAUGHING]
Silence. Pyramus draws near the wall.
Oh, grim-Iooked night!
[ALL LAUGHING]
Oh, grim-Iooked night!
Oh, night with hue so black!
[WHISPERING]
Oh, night which ever art when day is not.
Oh, night which ever art when day is not.
Oh, night. Oh, night!
Alack, alack, alack.
I fear my Thisbe's promise is forgot.
And thou, oh, wall,
Oh, sweet, oh, lovely wall.
Show me thy chink.
Show me thy chink!
To blink through with mine eyne.
Thanks, courteous wall.
[GIGGLING]
Jove, shield thee well for this.
But what see I?
No Thisbe do I see.
Oh, wicked wall, through whom I see no bliss.
Cursed be thy stones for thus deceiving me.
The wall, I think, being sensible, should curse again.
No, in truth, sir, he should not.
"Deceiving me" is Thisbe's cue. 
Deceiving me.
PYRAMUS
Deceiving me.
[CROWD LAUGHING]
Yonder she comes.
Psst!
Oh, wall, full often hast thou heard my moans.
Moans, moans, moans, moans.
For parting my fair Pyramus and me.
QUINCE:
Psst! Psst!
My cherry lips have often kiss'd thy stones.
Thy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee.
Thisbe. Thisbe. Thisbe.
Pyramus, Pyramus, Pyramus.
[SNOUT GIGGLING]
[CROWD LAUGHING]
My love thou art, my love I think.
Not...
Shafalus to Procrus.
Not Shafalus to Procrus was so true.
As Shoproc, as Prochoc-shaf...
As Shaf... As Prer...
As I to you.
Kiss me through the hole of this vile wall.
[SNOUT GIGGLING]
PYRAMUS:
Mm, mm, mm, mm.
I kiss the wall, not your lips at all.
Wilt thou... at Ninny's tomb meet me straightway?
Tide life, tide death,
I come without delay.
[LAUGHTER & APPLAUSE]
[GIGGLING] Thus have l, the wall, my part discharged so.
And being done, thus the wall away doth go.
The best of this kind are but shadows, and the worst are no worse if imagination assist them.
Let us listen to the moon.
ALL:
Ahhh.
This lanthorn doth the horned moon present myself the ma...
He should have worn the horns on his head.
[ALL LAUGHING]
This lanthorn doth the horned moon present myself the man in the moon do seem to be.
- This dog...
- This is the greatest error of all the rest.
The man should be put into the lanthorn.
- How else is it the man in the moon?
- This lanthorn doth...
I am so weary of this moon, would he would change.
- This lanthorn...
- Proceed, Moon.
All that I have say is that the lanthorn is the moon. l, the man in the moon, this thorn-bush, my thorn-bush, this dog, my dog.

Sweet moon
I thank thee for thy sunny beams
But stay, oh, spite!
What dreadful dole is here.
Oh, dainty duck. Oh, dear.
Thy mantle good.
What? Stain'd with blood.
Ah, Fates, come, come.
Cut thread and thrum.
Quail, crush, conclude...
[SOBBING] and quell!
This passion doth go near to make a man look sad.
[SPITS]
Come, tears, confound.
Out, sword, and wound the pap of Pyramus.
Ay, that left pap.
Where heart doth hop.
Thus die I... thus... thus... thus.
Oh, bless my heart, I pity the man.
[GRUNTING]
Now am I dead.
Now am I fled.
My soul... is in the sky.

PYRAMUS:
Moon, take thy flight.
Now... die, die, die, die, die.
[APPLAUSE]
[SINGING MERRILY]
[GASPS]
Oh.
THISBE:
Asleep, my love?
What, dead, my dove?
Come, Pyramus, arise.
Speak, speak, quite dumb?
Dead? Dead?
A tomb must cover thy sweet eyes.
Oh, sisters three, come, come to me... with hands as pale as milk.
[CROWD CHUCKLES]
Lay them in gore, since you have shore with shears his thread of silk.
Tongue, not a word.
Come, trusty sword.

Come, trusty sword.

Come, trusty sword.
Sword.

Come, trusty sword.

Come, trusty sword.

Come, trusty sword.
Come, blade, my breast in blue, blue.

[CROWD LAUGHING]
[LAUGHING]
Come, blade, my breast imbrue.
So farewell, friends, thus Thisbe ends.
Adieu, adieu, adieu.
[CROWD LAUGHING]
Oh, this is the silliest stuff that ever I heard.
Will it please you to see the epilogue?
[LAUGHING]
No, no epilogue, I pray you.
No epilogue.
Or a Bergomask dance between our company?
Come, your Bergomask.
[SINGING MARCH]
[BELL TOLLING]
Through the house, give glimmering light by the dead and drowsy fire.
Every elf and fairy sprite hop as light as bird from brier.

Hand in hand with fairy grace
Will we bless this place
And the owner of it blest
Ever shall in
Safety
Rest
FAIRIES [SINGING]:
Through the house, give glimmering light
By the dead and drowsy fire
Every elf and every sprite
Hop as light as bird from brier
Hop as light as bird from brier
The iron tongue of midnight hath tolled 12.
Lovers to bed.
'Tis almost fairy time.
I fear we shall outsleep the coming morn as much as we this night have overwatch'd.
Sweet friends, to bed.
A fortnight hold we this solemnity in nightly revels and new jollity.
[ALL LAUGHING & CHATTERING]
[PUCK LAUGHS]
If we shadows have offended, think but this and all is mended.
That you have but slumber'd here while these visions did appear.
And this weak and idle theme, no more yielding but to dream.
Gentles, do not reprehend, if you pardon, we will mend.
Else the Puck, a liar call, so good night unto you all.
Give me your hands, if we be friends and Robin shall restore amends!
Two tickets.
Ladies and gentlemen, step right up!
Come one, come all to the Hippo-Palace... where style meets fun.
Great. You're really getting a taste for it, madam.
What you need is a subscription.
Take the zebra this time.
That's it, jockey-style. Keep your knees in tight. Careful with the silk stockings!
Come on, you amazon ladies.
Saddle up quickly.
Half price for the military... and half price for children.
Hey, skinny, you're gonna tip us over!
Come on, try sideways!
Step right up!
Who wants a good time?
We give you a good time and in style!
Step right up.
Take a break from the other attractions.
We'll show you a good time.
No pushing or shoving.
You're not competing for a tea set here.
What we offer is personal pleasure.
Come on, ladies first.
I see we have some high society here.
You want to join in, kids?
Here they are, the real experts.
There's one seat left.
The last! The best!
Who will take it?
What's this?
An important visitor!
Over here, Admiral!
Only half price!
We've got a lot of roll and pitch here, and rough seas.
Bring your balloons over here.
Don't listen to him.
You'll get seasick.
It'll make you weak.
That's it, step right up!
Push the torpedo boat.
I'll show you how it's done.
Hey, Admiral, made up your mind yet?
Leave him.
Take a look at these pretties.
You've dreamed about them in the China Sea.
They're young, they're fresh, and they're not shy.
To find the same ones in Singapore... in Tananarive, in Chandernagore... you'd have to get up real early.
Don't listen to him!
Stay here!
You could be world champion in three shots.
No need for skill.
All you need is strength.
Watch this! Once.
Twice!
Three times!
There we go!
Now it's your turn.
I'm gonna feel the wind in my sails again.
Yes, but stay anchored on the good old earth.
Here, next to Mrs. Aperon.
She fought in the war, you know.
Take it slow. Have fun.
All right, any way you want.
Be careful you don't blow away.
There's a strong wind.
And that makes a full house!
Sorry, madam.
There'll be room on the next ride.
And now let me have your tickets.
Thanks, sweetheart.
Thank you.
I see you're not afraid of catching a cold.
What will I have the pleasure of singing for these ladies and gents?
- Something sentimental?
- "Love's Sorrow."
- Silence!
- "Speak To Me of Love."
We'll get to that later!
Silence!
You, the cutie over there!
This is your fourth ride.
What do you want me to sing?
Come on, I'm listening.
- "Come, Child's Child."
- Yes, "Come, Child's Child."
Sold! "Come, Child's Child."
Start the music.
Here we go, gently and slowly.
One, two, three, four...
Come with me, it's spring
The weather's so fair
That it makes my head spin
I'll take you for a ride on a carousel pony
In my neighborhood there's a party
Come, child's child
Let's go for a spin
Let's have a ball and turn and turn
Don't be beastly
We'll share true love
Night and day
On the carousel horses we will feel much better
Holding you tight against me
Cheek to cheek
We take off happily
Toward the sky
Come, child's child
We'll go for a spin
Here in my arms
We'll speak of love
Don't be beastly
We'll love each other truly
You have to grab it!
Hey, you see that?
Liliom's chatting up a young thing.
And he's right to do it.
You have to be friendly to customers.
I really don't care, but he's going a bit far.
What do you say?
Is Liliom right?
Just being friendly to the customers?
Go take care of your torpedo boat.
You might have a customer, though I doubt it.
Very well.
Don't bite, all right?
Did you see this one?
What a beautiful peony!
Someone snatched my peony.
A hooligan stole it from me.
Is that any way to behave?
I'm telling you, sir.
I turn my back for one minute... and it's gone.
Come on, don't make a scene.
If you want to ramble on, rent a booth like the rest of us.
Buy yourself a license.
Apologize or you'll be picked up by the cops.
I want my peony.
Look. Here it is.
- Oh, my peony!
- I didn't mean to yell at you.
Get out of here now.
- That's kind of you, buddy.
- Buddy?
He pushed you off.
I saw him.
- That's not true.
- You, beat it!
He picks on women and drunks... but strong guys like me, he wouldn't dare.
Drunk?
That'll teach you to take on my buddy.
Scumbag!
Isn't he strong?
He sure knows a lot of tricks.
You, I know what you are!
What do you think you're doing here?
I'm a working girl.
I have a nice position in a house.
A whorehouse, you mean.
With a license.
Fly legs!
Women who don't behave properly at the Hippo-Palace, out they go!
Me, not behaving properly?
I know how to behave, madam.
Just what do you take us for?
For a couple of easy women looking to be fondled by Liliom.
Fondled? I don't let anyone fondle me.
He was all over you for a whole ride.
No, madam.
He was leaning against the deer.
A man has the right to lean wherever he wants.
You are not going to tell
Mr. Liliom not to lean against me... when he was in fact leaning against the deer.
"Against the deer."
Liar!
- He was holding your waist.
- And if he was? What of it?
- I wasn't talking to you, fish-face.
- He was holding my waist to be polite.
- No kidding. How about the carnation?
- Madam!
Shut up, I tell you!
You were rubbing up against him, trying to get him excited.
Go back where you came from.
There's no shortage of soldiers!
Be quiet!
I'll do the talking here!
If I ever see you and your friend again on my carousel horses... just wait till you see what's coming to you!
Say what you will...
I paid for five rides.
I've only gone four times so far.
I intend to stay for the next ride.
- We'll see about that.
- Nobody's going to stop me.
Nobody.
Not me, of course.
I wouldn't dirty my paws.
But I'll have my employee kick you out.
Ah, but you like him handling you.
Well, you just wait.
Liliom!
Stop! The boss is calling you!
Get over here.
Recess is over.
What's up?
Liliom.
There's a little nobody over there making a scandal.
Just take a look at you!
You hooligan.
Liliom, it's that grasshopper over there.
I never want to see this again at the Hippo-Palace!
- Listen, Mr. Liliom...
- Come on, you two.
Come on, down you go.
Come on, shoo!
Come on, Julie.
These are not our kind of people.
Not so quick!
- If she comes back, you chase her off!
- Come on.
Mr. Liliom, please... tell me honest and truly... would you throw me out if I came back to the carousel?
Yes, sweetheart.
I'd throw you out lickety-split... if someone gave me a good reason.
Thank you, Mr. Liliom.
And I say you'll be thrown out!
I forbid solicitation here.
What? Solicitation?
She claims that you held me by the waist.
Is there some new rule?
I'm not allowed to be polite with the ladies anymore?
Do I have to ask permission now?
From whom?
You can play the heartthrob and knock up all the tramps you want... but not that one!
Dare I ask you very respectfully... to please shut your trap?
- What?
- Your trap!
To the cash register, on the double!
Come back anytime you want, sweetie.
Day or night, ride a pony, a deer, whatever you want.
If you're broke,
Liliom will treat you to a ride.
And if anyone dares look at you the wrong way, I'll spank her in public.
Bastard! I made you what you are!
You think I won't can you just 'cause you have the gift of gab?
Wrong!
I'll drop you like a ton of bricks... whenever I feel like it.
Like a ton of bricks?
I see.
I'm sailing.
Don't get upset. We're not arguing about these two tarts, are we?
Not a word about this young lady.
I've been fired. See you.
But, Mr. Liliom, she didn't say you're fired...
Shut up, you.
Apologize.
Apologize? Me?
- To whom?
- To the young lady.
Never!
You could offer me the entire casino, the amusement park... and the Rothschilds' fortune, and I'd still refuse, you hear?
That's it!
You've said enough!
Now, I advise you to make nice.
One...
I've never touched a woman to punish her.
Two...
Except for Mrs. Leclerc, who spent three weeks in the hospital.
Three...
There you have it.
Come on, kids.
I'm tired of playing the clown at the Hippo-Palace.
Get out of here! I never want to see you again, you dirty hooligan!
Out of commission!
Poor Mr. Liliom!
Don't feel sorry for me.
You too, or I'll smack you!
I'm not.
What will you do now, Mr. Liliom?
- Go for a drink.
- With us, Mr. Liliom?
I can't refuse, if you're paying.
Or you.
Are you rich?
- I've got eight...
- Eight francs?
Eight sous.
How about you?
No money?
Don't worry about it.
I'll get my things and then I'll buy us a drink.
Wait for me in front of the fakir, next to the doughnut stand.
No, make that near the bridge... at the fourth park bench on the avenue.
- Are you upset?
- Are you?
A little.
Me too.
She fired him on our account.
It's him!
You're both still here?
You told us to wait for you.
I only invited one of you.
The other one can take a walk.
So... which one will it be?
I'm waiting.
Mr. Liliom... if she gets in after midnight, her employers will fire her.
Fire her?
I was fired too.
Yes.
Good night, then.
So... we're in the same boat tonight.
Both of us, fired.
Let's not talk about that anymore.
You want to go for a drink?
Want to go dancing?
So, where do you want to go?
Do you have a sweetheart?
Don't lie.
I'm not lying.
I'd tell you if I did.
I've never had one.
Come on, you stayed because you know the tune.
What tune?
This can't be!
Don't tell me you don't know why you're sitting here in the dark... close to me.
What's your name?
Your first name.
Julie.
Police.
Here are two more!
Your papers.
- Oh, it's you.
- Military papers, as usual.
They had to add an extra page for previous offenses.
Ask the sergeant for a character reference. He knows me.
This is Liliom, Inspector.
A carnival barker, hauled in several times... for assault and battery and drunkenness in public.
Is that your girlfriend?
No.
- Your name?
- Julie Boulard.
- Chambermaid?
- Show us your hands.
No, all-purpose maid.
Why aren't you at your employer's home... instead of roaming around at this hour with this character?
It's my day off.
He'll take your savings and then,
"So long, see you!"
I don't have any money.
You're barking up the wrong tree with this one, Liliom.
You've got me mixed up with someone else, Sergeant.
Julie Boulard, I must warn you... against this dangerous seducer of maids.
He'll promise to marry you, then he'll make off with your money.
But have no fear.
Come with us.
One of our men will escort you to your employer's house.
Is that an order?
Just some friendly advice.
Thank you, sir.
- I'm going to stay.
- You've been warned.
Thank you very much.
Let's go.
So now you know all about me.
You heard them.
I'll take all your savings.
I don't have any money.
But if I had,
I'd give it all to you... with all my heart.
- You'd give it to me?
- If you asked me to.
Do you love me?
No, Mr. Liliom.
I don't understand.
You're a strange girl.
I suppose so.
Good evening.
- You're not gonna put this one out?
- No, just every other one.
That's too bad.
So now... it's just the two of us.
Aren't you afraid here in the dark... with a dangerous seducer of maids?
I'm not afraid, Mr. Liliom.
Perhaps not tonight... but what about tomorrow?
Would you stay with me... forever?
Assuming you love me, of course.
If I loved someone...
I wouldn't be afraid of anything.
Not even death.
PHOTOGRAPHY STUDIO
Don't you want any?
Yes, a little later.
That's what you say, but once
I turn my back, you don't touch it.
Another drop?
One has to keep one's strength up.
I know you've never been the type to pack on the pounds.
But this is too much.
Really... you're as skinny as a bird.
Someone has to be there to serve you when you come home so late.
There's a knot in these laces.
Can you get it out?
In the beginning...
In the beginning... you didn't spend all your nights out.
I can't hang around here all the time... with that damn organ blasting in our ears.
I'm exhausted... and from doing nothing!
The same old story from morning till night.
Your old aunt works, Julie works... but you, you're still in bed!
What kind of work should I do?
I never learned a trade.
Work as a day laborer?
Never.
You could have accepted that caretaker position last week.
Room and free heat.
A caretaker.
Now that's what I call a job!
A caretaker! Who, me?
- You haven't taken a good look at me.
- Liliom is an artist at heart.
"An artist at heart."
In other words, a loafer.
Starting fights... that's his best work.
How many times did you pick him up at the police station last month?
They released him each time.
He was innocent.
They were wrong! They should have kept him, and good riddance!
Old goat!
A little more coffee?
With three lumps of sugar.
First-class.
And now, a half cup for my strange little girl.
- Is it all gone?
- The important thing is you liked it.
So that's it.
It's all my fault.
I drank it all.
You're exhausted.
I'm to blame for that too.
I'm tired of your constant criticism.
- Enough of your martyred looks!
- Stop, you'll break it!
That takes the cake!
I think only of you, and all you can say is, "Don't break the coffee pot."
Well, there!
And the cup too!
- Those didn't belong to us.
- Be quiet!
- I won't be quiet.
- That's enough.
Liliom, it always ends like this.
I won't speak to you for a whole week!
Did he strike you?
He should be ashamed!
Did he hurt you?
Did you slap him back?
When I was young, I always hit back.
Poor little thing!
Listen, the carpenter is coming to have his portrait taken.
Why don't you go and fetch the 5-by-7 frames?
Lazy coward!
"Report to the police station on July 17 at 10:00"
Can't you watch where you're going?
At your service.
- Quick, Julie, the customer's here.
- I'm coming.
I'm telling you, it will be just fine.
You can count on me.
I'll take care of everything.
So she didn't say no?
- Good day, sir.
- Good day, Miss Julie.
It was a 5-by-7 portrait you wanted, right?
No... I mean, yes.
- Five-by-seven, so to speak.
- It's a little more expensive, of course.
Two francs more.
Price is no object, Miss Julie.
If you don't mind, we'll get started right away.
Julie, set the gentleman up for the pose.
Please come this way, sir.
Julie, take into account the man's style.
He has a nice figure.
Prepare something dapper for him.
Business is doing great, Miss Julie.
I'm expanding the store.
- How about a column?
- Yes.
With a column, the portrait will really stand out.
- There...
- Pardon me.
- There would be work for two people...
- Lift your head.
...in my shop, Miss Julie.
- Put your arm here.
You need a woman's touch in a prosperous business.
Smile!
Don't move.
Act natural.
A little more.
Look over here.
Very good!
I'm going to count to three.
Here we go!
One, two...
- three.!
- POLICE STATION
Alfred, what are you doing here?
- Were you summoned too?
- No, but... you must need a witness.
But you weren't there.
All the more reason.
I'll testify to anything.
Come on in.
- Who told you to enter?
- I was told to come at 10:00.
Wait in the hallway.
All right.
Bring out the cards.
Your deal.
- Five flush?
- Five flush.
No card playing allowed here.
NO SPITTING
NO SMOKING
NO DOGS ALLOWED
KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN
It would be simpler if they said what we can do.
Liliom Zadowski.
I'm his witness.
Liliom Zadowski and his witness.
You were summoned for the...
I've already been summoned to the police station three times.
Everything I have to say is written in my statement.
That may be, but your statement contains a legal error.
It's missing a stamp.
Isn't that the management's fault?
Get it through your head that management is never at fault.
- Well, then, can I go?
- No.
According to the provisions of the decree of August 17th, 1874... the defendant must be present when the stamp is applied.
Strange.
- Sir.
- That's all.
You may go.
You made me wait around for four hours for that?
BE BRIEF... YOUR TIME
IS AS PRECIOUS AS OURS
Precisely! I want to lodge a complaint with the inspector.
- He's not in.
- When do you expect him?
- Not for a while.
- Pardon me. I'd like to see the inspector.
- He's not in.
- Oh, yes he is.
If you'd care to follow me, the inspector will receive you.
- May I say who is calling?
- The Baron of Cabrol.
Very good.
Sorry to delay you.
Did you see that?
If I was dressed like a bigwig, they'd kiss my feet too.
And the inspector would be at my beck and call.
Justice is all about false collars.
Don't make a scene.
Come on, Alfred.
Since Olinger replaced him on the carousel... it's small change.
You should have seen it when Liliom was there.
- We sold so many tickets!
- Of course, Mrs. Muskat.
Liliom's real place is at the carousel.
It's in your best interest, and his too.
He'll make money for you again.
Julie will finally have something to live on, the poor thing.
- And I won't be obliged to feed a bum.
- Precisely.
Thank you, Mrs. Muskat.
Liliom will decide.
Unfortunately, he isn't here.
- He's never here!
- I'm not surprised.
To live all day in this miserable place would give anyone the blues.
Especially him... an artist!
What he needs is the Hippo-Palace.
But he'd rather starve than make the first move.
But no matter.
I'll take him back.
Let him know.
I'll be back tomorrow.
You're upset because you're broke.
I am too, but I can laugh about it... because it won't last forever.
- One of these days...
- What?
You know the leather factory?
Every Friday, the cashier takes a certain route with the employee payroll.
Suppose we get to him when he's alone? No witnesses.
I already said no, so why not drop it?
Fine, if you'd rather starve.
- Unless you're expecting an inheritance.
- Enough about that, or we're through.
All right, all right.
In that case, you'll have to find some other way.
THE ISLE OF LOVE
Thanks.
- For the lady.
- Look at those legs!
What a pair of legs!
- Did you hear taxes are going up?
- I don't care.
I don't declare my income.
Hey, Liliom. Where've you been?
You're looking great.
- Still leading the good life?
- What do you think? And yourself?
A nice crowd.
A bunch of simpletons,
I tell you.
- Shall we get together later?
- I'll let you know in a while.
See you later, then.
- Is that all?
- I know a trick.
Nice and easy.
And now all we have to do is spot a drunk... and not mess up.
- A stinger.
- And a mint mandarin.
- So, buddy, are you up for it?
- You cut.
No, take this away.
Go ahead, write it down.
- Right on the mark again!
- One, two and it's over.
It's like he's guessing my cards every time.
- I'm buying.
- Do you have a cigarette?
One more time, big guy.
Double or nothing?
- I was just about to suggest it.
- Your turn.
He won't be home tonight.
Mrs. Menoux, it's still early.
Are the pictures ready for the carpenter?
I still have to glue two of them.
Tomorrow morning.
The carpenter is a handsome man.
He has a nice position.
Plenty of money.
He'd love nothing more than to marry you.
Wouldn't you like that?
Liliom beats you.
Between a hooligan and a decent man, you take the hooligan!
It takes all kinds to make a world.
It's going to end badly.
One day Liliom will hit you harder, and then...
When I'm with him, nothing matters to me... even dying.
Dying is easy.
Living's the hard part.
If I were you,
I'd marry the carpenter.
To be middle-class... what a dream!
A wedding all in white, with a veil and train.
You'd have a home, plenty of money... the respect of the entire neighborhood.
Men would tip their hat to you on the street.
And presents galore!
And you'd have servants,
I imagine.
A maid just to take care of the baby... because I'm sure you'd have a little baby right away.
A little angel smiling up at you, all wrapped in lace.
Don't trouble yourself so,
Mrs. Menoux.
I'll never marry the carpenter.
Never.
Mrs. Muskat is here.
Thanks for the tip.
Hello, Liliom.
Always the comedian.
What do you want?
Guess.
Come on, I'm sure you know.
Olinger isn't working out.
Sure he is.
Well, then?
Go make some coffee.
Go on.
You're not being reasonable.
You don't sleep at night.
You look lousy.
What's it to you?
Come on, move that mop out of the way.
Hands off!
All right, all right.
Olinger...
I could fire him.
I can fire him.
Why, if he's working out fine?
Yes, of course.
I see what's going on.
Someone misses me.
Cocky!
No, not me.
It's the chambermaids who are asking for Liliom.
The dumbbells!
They're all nuts, I tell you.
Do come back.
I'll give you a raise.
What about Julie?
I'd have to drop her, right?
They say you beat her.
So I hear.
So what?
None of your business.
It's nothing to boast about.
If you're tired of her...
Drop her, right?
I get the picture.
Don't be arrogant.
Come on.
Go ahead and say it.
You're not happy with her.
You think about the carousel ponies.
The organ. The lights.
Come on, you amazon ladies!
Come, child's child, let's go for a spin
Let's have a ball and turn and turn
Don't be beastly
We'll share true love
Night and day
On the carousel horses we will feel much better
Holding you tight against me
Cheek to cheek
We take offhappily
Toward the sky
Those were the good times.
We had no idea.
Did you hear
I bought a new organ?
I've got ears.
It's all I hear these days.
And you know the two black horses with the broken ears?
They're gone!
What did you put in their place?
What would you have put in their place?
Cars.
Airplanes.
Airplanes?
And that's not all.
The gondola that was always tearing up the ladies' dresses...
- Remember the problem with Labraux...
- The wife of the fruit vendor.
I knew it.
The answer is yes.
You'll come back.
Really, are you an artist or a caretaker?
Please, not a caretaker!
What aboutJulie?
Your little Julie isn't going to starve.
To sum it up...
Olinger isn't the ticket.
Can anyone replace you?
Hooligan!
- Will you?
- Yes, I will!
I'm going back to the carousel.
What is it?
Nothing.
- I've got something to tell you.
- It can't be urgent.
- But it is. Yesterday...
- Can't you see I'm busy?
- It won't take long.
- Leave me alone.
- It won't take long.
- Beat it!
What?
I'm not leaving.
Hit me if you like.
Not in front of me!
You two have a little chat.
I'll be waiting.
It's a good thing
I'm a patient man!
Well? I'm listening!
My head was hurting yesterday.
You asked me why I...
You also said
I had changed a lot.
Yeah. So?
That's all.
It's what I thought.
What? Are you ill?
No, I'm not ill.
Well, then?
Can you let me in on it?
Yes. It's just that...
Help me.
It's a very natural thing.
I'm not afraid.
- It was bound to happen.
- What?
When a man and a woman live together...
I'm going to have a baby.
What?
A baby?
Did she leave?
Yes.
Here's an advance of 200 francs.
Why don't you take it?
Let me eat in peace, Mrs. Muskat.
Can't you see I'm eating?
Isn't that enough?
I don't know if the message is getting through.
Go back to your carousel horses!
Take a good look at me now... because you're never going to see me again!
You promise?
Don't tease me.
Ever again.
Mrs. Muskat!
Leave without looking back
Julie's going to have a baby.
Julie's going to have a baby.
Julie's going to have a baby!
Go on.
- Auntie!
- What is it?
When a woman...
You'd know if...
Is it...
I mean, is it dangerous... when a woman...
When a woman what?
Spit it out!
- Nothing.
- Drunk again.
Congratulations, I hear you're taking real good care of Julie!
She'll die in the street if she counts on you, lazy bum!
Alfred!
- Hey, big guy!
- What's up?
Tell me... didn't you talk to me about a job... that could bring in a nice chunk?
Yes, but it'd take two guys to pull it off.
You and me.
With me, it's a sure thing.
I've been around.
I'll think about it.
Leave me in peace.
Step right up, ladies and gentlemen!
Today we bring out the flags and the lights!
Half price for everybody.
Saddle up on the deer, Inspector!
That's it.
Keep your knees together.
Here on the horse we have the sergeant, jockey-style! Wax that mustache!
Police ride for free today!
Let the music begin!
I'm going to have a baby!
Why are you shouting so loud?
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Nothing.
Where does he keep the money?
In a leather bag.
Sixty bills.
Payroll for the week.
I got a bite!
In the bucket, little one.
Maybe we wouldn't have to... kill him.
Not if he hands over the money nicely, but you can't count on it.
A quick stab in the ribs is a safer bet... no complications.
Sixty thousand francs.
Then we split for America right away.
No, that's just the thing that'll get you caught.
The dough stays hidden for six months as if nothing happened.
In exactly six months... the little one will be born.
Three months before we leave, you get a job.
You put money aside, or that's what you say.
Then off we go to America, without a trace.
How will it happen, more or less?
It's child's play.
We wait for him in the small tunnel.
It's his usual route.
You'll be over there, and you'll say to him...
"Good evening.
Could you tell me the time?"
Repeat that.
"Good evening.
Could you tell me the time?"
Add "please."
It sounds more polite that way.
And then I'll...
I'll hit him on the head... from the back.
And then you...
You stab him.
"Good evening.
Could you please tell me..."
Say, about the knife...
You think it's really necessary?
You can give it a try with my fishing pole... but I can't guarantee anything.
Do you... have a knife?
Here, take this.
Take it!
Take it, for God's sake!
- Listen...
- Hide it!
Wrap it in your handkerchief.
Hurry up!
Come on.
And at night... in my dreams... he'll be there.
When I arrive in front of the good Lord... what will I say to Him?
Lowlifes like us never go in front of the Lord, for one thing.
Why?
Have you ever been in front of a chief of police?
Well, then?
The inspector and us...
We never see anyone higher then the inspector.
Maybe it's not the same up there.
Why would it be any different?
God handles the bigwigs.
He hands the tramps off to his inspector.
Music and angels are for the bigwigs.
And we get...
- We get what?
- All we get is justice!
In the other world, that's all we'll ever get.
An inspector, at best.
But where there's an inspector, you can bet they won't miss you... so don't worry.
"Good evening."
"Could you please tell me the time?"
"Could you please tell me..."
There he is!
I sharpen... scissors... razors... and knives.
Do you have anything to sharpen?
A knife?
- We have nothing to sharpen.
- Sir... let a poor man earn a few sous.
Come on. It doesn't cost much.
Take advantage of this special opportunity.
You're bugging us with your chatter!
Pity.
No, that's it.
I'm backing out.
- It's too disgusting!
- All right!
Let's drop it.
Julie will have her baby in the gutter, that's all.
Watch out, there he is.
"Good evening. Could you please tell me the time?" Don't chicken out.
Listen...
Good evening.
Could you...
Could you please tell me the time?
It's 24 minutes past 5:00.
On the dot.
Let me go, sir.
I didn't do anything to you.
- No?
- No, it was him.
And what about this?
Move and I'll shoot!
- I just...
- Wanted to know the time?
Well, now you know.
And do you know who's coming this way?
The knife-grinder.
The knife-grinder?
Two policemen.
Stop! Stop!
Hold it!
Hold it there!
- You'll never get me!
- Hands up!
Quick, you there!
He's through.
One less... no big loss.
He didn't have any money for over a week.
Cards and fights, that's all he did for work.
60,000 francs. They're waiting for the payroll at the factory.
Caretaker?
Now that's what I call a job.!
I'll send the doctor from the factory with a stretcher.
We'll leave the body where it is until the authorities arrive.
Justice, all we get is justice.
Come on. It doesn't cost much.
Take advantage of this special opportunity.
Two tickets.
Mrs. Muskat!
- What are you doing here?
- I need 200 francs right now!
Two hundred francs. Go fly a kite.
Get out of here!
Two hundred francs, right now!
Liliom...
The doctor said there's no point taking him to the hospital.
He'd only die on the way.
- Is that his wife?
- Yes.
He's barely breathing... but he's still fully conscious.
Julie, say something!
Let's leave her alone.
Julie, if there's anything I can do...
Do you have a table where I could finish writing my report?
- Please come in, Officer.
- After you.
Miss Julie... if you need me, I'm here... so to speak.
- Is that you?
- Yes.
I wasn't able to give you a thing.
Not a roof over your head... not even enough to eat every day.
I'm a bastard, a rotten bastard.
If there were a job I could do...
Caretaker? Oh, no.
I thought things would be better in America.
Don't cry.
I sure beat you!
I'm not apologizing.
After all, you couldn't have always been right.
Liliom wants to be right too.
Nobody's right.
Tell the kid his father was a bastard.
Yes. Tell him.
Tonight...
I will see... the good Lord.
Will I see him?
Yes.
I have to see Him.
Not the inspector, or I'm done for.
If I see the good Lord...
I'll explain to Him.
He'll understand.
Yes.
My little girl... hold my hand tight.
Tighter.
Even tighter.
I'm holding your hand very tight.
What's wrong?
Stop it! Stop everything!
Three minutes of silence, gentlemen.
Liliom the carnival barker is dead.
Hear that, Liliom?
What a silence falls over the carnival!
Because everyone knows.
No, they don't know... what I never said, even to you.
Now I can tell you.
Bad boy, brute... darling.
The party goes on.
Sleep in peace.
Now I feel ashamed for never telling you... how much your strange little girl loved you.
Good night, Liliom.
Come inside.
There's not even a candle.
I'll bring some right away.
Come, Julie.
Arise.
Arise and follow.
The moment has come to give an account.
It would be too convenient if death resolved everything,
Liliom, you must follow us.
We are God's policemen.
To stab yourself... to save yourself when you don't know what to do anymore... leaving behind a woman with a child in her womb.
Where would justice be if death wiped the slate clean?
Being a man would be very convenient if that were the case.
POLICE STATION
Please announce our arrival.
Numbers 312 and 13,000 are back.
What's that?
Wait there.
Naturally.
Sit down.
- So this is the place...
- For those who commit suicide.
Anyone who killed himself... must come here for questioning.
Silence!
Too late.
Pity.
Who is he?
Did he also...
He was your guardian angel, Liliom.
My guardian angel?
- He might have said so!
- Silence!
"Paradise Daily"
NO SPITTI NG
Liliom!
ENTRANCE TO
THE POLICE STATION
PROCEED WITHOUT KNOCKING
Step up.
Last name, first name and status.
- Liliom.
- Surname?
Zadowski, like my mother.
Age?
Twenty-eight.
Yes?
It's missing a stamp.
Naturally.
Tell Mr. Emile to come up immediately... so that I may apply the stamp.
According to the provisions... of paragraph...
Seventeen of the Police Rules dated March 22, 1721 BC... you have the right to return to Earth...
- for one night.
- What for?
When you commit suicide, you usually forget something in haste or panic.
- No, I don't believe so.
- Think about it.
Something left unsaid, some unfinished business... some wrong that needs to be righted... some matter that needs to be settled.
Yes.
- I'd like to...
- What?
...break Alfred's neck!
Sanctions and punishments are for us to deal with. Anything else?
Now that I'm here, I'm staying.
Very well.
"Declines."
Take this down.
"Number 5,673,210,109,212,003...
Liliom Zadowski, here present... waives his right to return to Earth for one night."
Hello, Mr. Emile.
There's an error on the registration form of the man they sent down below.
It's missing a stamp.
It's management's fault.
Get it through your head that management is never at fault.
Naturally.
Let me have that.
Strange.
Don't waste your time.
Top drawer on the right.
- There, now everything's legal.
- Thank you.
Good-bye.
Hope to see you soon.
Why did you kill yourself?
You abandoned a woman to the deepest misery.
Your wife... who's expecting a child... your child... in six months.
Listen, since I'm dead...
I'd like to at least reap the benefits.
Stop bothering me with all these accusations.
Do you feel no remorse, Liliom?
I want to go to sleep... and never wake up.
That would be too easy.
What about justice?
Do you regret having been a bad husband?
A bad husband? Me?
Yes, you, Liliom.
I couldn't work.
What would I do?
Be a caretaker?
Not me.
I couldn't stay there all day and watch...
Julie...
Cry?
Say it.
Don't be ashamed of having loved her.
Ashamed? Me?
Absolutely not.
I couldn't stand that... so I listened to Alfred, that's all.
And why did you beat that unfortunate woman?
- Because you loved her?
- No!
I beat her because she got on my nerves.
You're lying, Liliom.
I'm not lying.
We got into arguments.
She'd take one side,
I'd take the other.
Yes, no, yes, no.
Suddenly I'd get angry and fed up to here... and I'd hit her.
- I'll prove that you're lying.
- I dare you!
Show the corroborating footage of Liliom Zadowski's life... dated July 17th, 8:40 A.M.
Ready to roll.
Turn around.
"July 17 th, 8:40 a.m."
A little more coffee?
With three lumps of sugar.
That's amazing!
That's Julie!
- That's her!
- Don't touch the screen!
First-class.
And now, a half cup for my strange little girl.
Wait for what comes next...
- Is it all gone?
- The important thing is you liked it.
So that's it.
It's all my fault.
I drank it all.
You're exhausted.
I'm to blame for that too.
I'm tired of your constant criticism.
- Enough of your martyred looks.!
- Stop, you'll break it.!
There, what did I tell you?
Roll the film again... but this time with Liliom's thoughts on the sound track.
You see, we can also record your thoughts.
How about that!
First-class.
And now, a half cup for my strange little girl.
Well?
- What a bastard.! I drank it all.!
- Hey! Wait a minute!
The important thing is you liked it.
She deprives herself for me, poor kid.
I sure don't miss an opportunity.
It's the same thing every time.
She's dead-tired, yet I let her wait on me.
I only think of myself.
What a lout.!
If I were her, I wouldn't stay with such a hooligan for long.
Liliom, don't get upset.
Pure fiction, all of it!
We can see through you like through a piece of glass.
Continue with Liliom's thoughts.
Liliom, don't get upset.
I know she's right.
I'd like to ask her to forgive me, but the words just won't come out.
I feel I'm gonna do something ugly. There.!
I'm disgusted at myself.
I'm so ashamed.!
No, don't... don't... No.!
My poor little muffin.
I run off so I won't have to see the look in her eyes.
Lights.
God didn't put love in men's hearts for them to be ashamed of it.
Do you feel any remorse?
You do feel sad.
Sad, me?
- Liliom, it's impossible to help you!
- I don't care to be helped.
Fortunately, heavenly patience has no limit.
What about the child?
Her child.
My child.
Will it be a boy or a girl?
You'll see for yourself.
- I'll see the child?
- Yes, when it's 16 years old.
Because you are sentenced to burn for 16 years... in the fires that will purge your pride and fury.
Sixteen years?
I thought it would be forever.
Sixteen years from now... you'll be allowed to return to Earth for a single day... to see your child.
My child.
Go, Liliom.
In 16 years and one day, we shall see each other again.
By then, you will have been tested.
Seek and find something beautiful... something splendid for your child.
Everything depends on this.
Go, Liliom.
PURGATORY
- Excuse me, sir.
- What do you want?
- Some information.
- What?
Would you be kind enough to tell me... whether it will be a boy or a girl?
That's not allowed.
At least give me a cigarette.
Don't let anyone see it.
For 16 years...
I won't lack for a light.
A girl!
Sixteen years.
Liliom, something beautiful.
Something splendid.
Here.
Please, take it.
Thank you.
In return I wish I could give you something... beautiful.
Something splendid.
Me? I don't even know you.
But I know you.
You must be mistaken.
My mother is a seamstress,
I help her.
I bring her work to the customers.
What about your father?
He died a long time ago.
What did he die of?
We never found out.
He went to America to find work.
He died in a hospital there.
- In America?
- Yes.
- In America?
- Does that surprise you?
Did you know him?
- As well as I know myself.
- Oh, I'm so happy.
He was a good man... a sweet man, wasn't he?
My mother often says that.
No, he wasn't sweet at all.
But he knew a lot of songs... some of them very pretty.
That's true. Listen.
Come, child's child
We'll go for a spin
My mother would play it on the phonograph all the time.
Let's have a ball and turn and turn
Don't be beastly
We'll love each other truly
Yes, he used to sing it often.
Very often.
In the end, he couldn't stand to hear it anymore.
He was a hooligan, you know?
He'd beat your mother for no reason.
A real animal.
- What are you saying?
- A real brute.
- That's not true!
- A lazy bum.
All he thought about was playing cards, fighting, drinking and chasing skirts!
A man who lived off his poor old aunt.
A filthy, selfish man who let his wife wait on him.
Be quiet! Mother told me a thousand times what he was like.
He used to bring all his money home.
It's awful to tarnish the memory of a poor dead man this way.
Don't be angry!
Please don't go!
I want to give you something.
Something beautiful.
- Something splendid.
- I don't want anything from you.
A most unusual gift.
Take this... but watch out.
- A star...
- Go away.
I'll accept nothing from a man who says evil things about my dad.
Miss... Miss!
Could I see Julie again?
Sixteen years.
You again!
How did you get in?
Miss, let me explain.
- Go away.
- I've come from very far away.
- I won't listen.
- But, Miss!
I'd like to do something beautiful for you, something splendid.
No. Leave here immediately.
- Miss...
- Go!
Enough of that!
Sixteen years of purgatory weren't enough... to burn away your pride and fury.
Incorrigible!
Absolutely incorrigible!
To torment the heart of a child... that held a deep love for you.
What do you have to say in your defense?
You have to love me as I am.
Why try to make me better than I am?
Alfred was right.
For us... even in heaven there's only justice... nothing but justice.
And justice...
Mother.
Mother, did anyone ever hit you?
I mean a real slap... that you can hear ring... and yet you don't feel a thing?
Yes, my child.
There was a time someone hit me... but I didn't feel a thing.
Then it's possible... for someone to hit you and not hurt you at all?
Yes, my child.
Someone can beat you... without hurting you at all.
THE END
Flowers?
Yes, yes. They're beautiful, aren't they? More.
All of them, sir?
Yes, all of them!
[Laughs]
My dear!
Oh!
Oh, Lambert, what are we going to do with so many?
[Lambert]
Beautiful flowers
to a beautiful lady!
My dear, I'm not dead yet.
I don't need flowers.
Half dead, anyway.
Oh, you!
There.
Oh, you beast!
[Laughs]
Grazia!
I thought I'd be back before you missed me.
It's getting late.
Father's eager to get home.
He's expecting
Prince Sirki tonight.
[Honks Horn]
Here they come.
Come along, we're waiting for you.
[Honks Horn]
Lambert, sound your horn for Corrado to slow down.
L... I've got to catch him first!
Your son has no respect for the nerves of your house guests.
And he has Grazia with him.
Her mother will never forgive us!
Apparently my reward for a misspent life is not to be a peaceful death in bed!
The strangest shadow is following us.
Following?
It was right behind us all the time we were racing.
It's the shadow of a tree.
It isn't a tree.
Sometimes it's close by and sometimes we almost lose it.
Let's lose it!
Let's go fast enough to reach the illimitable!
Whatever that is.
Oh, it's catching up with us!
[Screaming]
[All Screaming]
[Tires Screeching]
Stephanie! Stephanie,
Are you all right?
Quite right, my dear.
And the others?
It's ridiculous!
We all ought to be dead!
You, Cesarea?
I marvel I'm still alive!
Heavens above!
The flower vendor!
Oh, I'll never forgive myself for this!
Flowers, sir?
Fresh autumn flowers.
You're alive?
I think so. Yes, sir.
But Celeste... she's hurt?
Celeste?
Ah!
Oh!
You know, there... there was a curious shadow before me.
L-I couldn't even see the cart.
It's unbelievable that no one was hurt.
Yes.
Uh, in case you find any further injury.
Yes, Excellenza!
Oh.
Celeste, looka what I got!
Whee! Don't tell me we're here, just as if nothing had happened.
Nothing did happen.
What are we going to do with these lovely flowers?
Throw them at people we don't like.
You, for instance!
[Laughing]
Or you!
- That's for your best...
- [Chattering, Laughing]
What's going on here?
Oooh!
That drew blood!
Children, children!
Those beautiful flowers!
[Chattering,
Laughing Continue]
Absolutely mad, all of them!
Oh, you beast! What a ride.
Is my hair completely white?
Completely.
Help me get this off, will you?
We almost had an accident.
Almost!
We flirted with the coroner's inquest and passed on.
What happened, son?
Oh, I don't know.
My headlights must be out of order.
There was a curious shadow in front of me, and I didn't see the cart at all.
A shadow... that's odd.
And just that last second some instinct told me to swerve.
Oh, that instinct came to me somewhat late.
I hit the cart.
You did, sir?
Was anyone hurt?
No, nobody hurt, not even the vendor... though he went flying through the air like a great crow.
Yes, he did fly a bit, didn't he?
Good evening, Fedele.
Good evening, Eccellenza,
Contessa.
I've had a glimpse of deep waters tonight, and I don't like it.
You know, there seemed to be something desirable in flying over the edge.
I had a curious glimpse of it.
Yes, well you ought to take something for that, Alda, and I suggest a whiskey and soda.
Thank you.
Why are you so silent?
What's the matter, darling?
You.
Oh, don't worry about me, Eric.
I'd only disappoint you.
Why would you disappoint me?
I'm too restless for marriage.
Besides, I've had that once.
Your whiskey and soda, darling.
Ah, thank you.
Maria, did you think we were never coming back?
No, I've been playing solitaire.
Is Grazia with you?
Your daughter is in the garden with my son... uh, our son, darling.
Grazia, dear.
Corrado, isn't this the strangest night?
There's something miraculous in the air, like an old story you can't quite believe.
I can almost hear a rustling of wings in this garden, in this moonlight.
Shall we go in now, dear?
[Laughing]
Darling, are
you all right?
Of course, Mother dear.
I was so frightened when I heard of your accident.
But we had no accident, did we, Corrado?
No.
I like going fast.
It feels like wings.
Don't, Grazia.
You disturb me when you talk like that.
Oh, we think you've been free long enough.
When are you going to fold your wings and be my little daughter-in-law?
Father's going to build us a villa in the woods, Grazia, just at the top of the cliff.
How nice.
Thank you, sir.
Oh, I'd do anything for you.
Let's make it next month,
Grazia.
[Duke] Do, dear.
[Maria] You could be
quite ready in a month.
I wish I could, but...
We could spend the winter in the Riviera, and in Egypt and Greece.
You know how much you want to see the Aegean Isles.
It's only a question of making up your mind.
You know I love you all, and I want to please you, but l...
Don't you see?
I'm not ready.
But why, Grazia?
Because life is too...
There's a kind of happiness
I want to find first, if I can.
Aren't you happy with me?
Yes, dear, but that isn't quite what I mean.
I wish I knew how to tell you.
There's something out there that I must find first... something that
I must understand.
May I go with you?
I'd rather be alone, if you don't mind.
Leave her alone, my boy.
Life'll tame her fast enough.
[Maria]
She worries me so.
[Alda]
Oh, I shouldn't worry
about her.
She's so young,
she's just a little frightened
at the whole idea.
Bad evening for you, dear?
She's so lovely, Mother.
Yes... delicate, so fine.
You'll win her.
If I deny every human impulse, if I live only in music and poetry.
But love is music, and love is poetry!
But Mother, one can't live on beauty alone.
For instance, one occasionally likes a drink.
Tonight I'd like a dozen after what I've been through.
You'll never win her that way.
I know, Mother.
She loves you.
I'm sure of it.
And I love her till I'm half mad with it, and there's nothing to do!
[Woman Screaming]
[Alda]
What on earth was that?
[Corrado] It's Grazia!
Where is she?
Is she hurt?
What's the matter
with her?
What happened?
I don't know.
She was just lying here.
Get her into the house, quick.
Here, is she wounded?
[All Chattering]
It's all right, it's all right.
Get the couch ready for her.
Here, right here, Corrado.
There, on the sofa.
Is there brandy, there?
Brandy, quick!
Here, lift her up a little, here.
Poor child. Poor child.
Oh, poor little dear.
No, she can't take this yet.
Don't let it come in!
Oh, please don't cry so!
What do you suppose happened?
Some prowler may have
frightened her.
Too much moonlight.
She'll come around.
If anyone's harmed her...
Eric, take Fedele and search the grounds.
Yes, sir.
Grazia!
It's Mother!
What frightened you?
[Grazia Sobbing]
Darling, try to tell us what happened.
I don't know.
There was something cold and terrible.
I was sitting by the fountain, watching the water.
I could hear the music.
And then a shadow blew over.
[Grazia]
That's what it was, a shadow.
[Sobbing]
It's all right, Grazia.
You're safe now.
And then an icy wind touched me, but it wasn't a wind because all the leaves were still.
Perhaps you fell asleep, and dreamed.
No, I saw it!
What?
What did you see?
[Grazia]
A shadow,
an enormous darkness.
And yet it wasn't a shadow, because the moon shone through it.
Oh, Corrado,
I felt something behind me, running.
There wasn't any sound, but I felt someone!
It's all right, Grazia.
[Baron]
It all comes
of this fast driving.
You scare everybody to death.
Yes, yes, that's it, of course.
L-It was the drive...
and the danger.
Something touched me... something cold!
We'll have to get her to bed at once. You must stay here tonight, Maria.
So many guests!
Nonsense, Maria.
Cora!
Go and get the room ready.
[Grazia Whimpers]
Ridiculous when you can't go into your own garden without being frightened to death.
I've told Lambert time and time again we should have a watchman for this place.
It's much too big.
Maria?
Yes, dear?
Give Corrado your jewels to put in the safe.
If they're going to rob us, they shan't find anything.
There, there. You'll be in bed in just a minute and you'll feel much better.
Lambert? Tell Fedele to lock up the silver... all the silver!
Alda, would you mind if I slept in your room tonight?
I'm still tingling from that scream.
You know,
I rather wish you would.
I don't want to be alone, either.
I thought you modern girls had no nerves.
- Hah! Have you none?
- None at all!
[Clock Chiming]
Great Scott!
[Sighs]
Midnight, and everyone calm and collected... even the baron.
Come along, Rhoda.
I think I'll feel safer in bed.
So shall I.
Good night.
Good night.
Good night, Rhoda.
Good night, Alda.
These children go too fast.
None of them'll live as long as I have.
[Chuckles]
[Rhoda] Will you be sure
to lock all the doors?
I'll-I'll see to it.
Good night.
Good night.
[Eric]
Well, he got away...
if there was anyone.
We've searched the grounds thoroughly, sir.
Not a sign of anyone.
Did you go as far as the lake?
Yes, sir.
Would you like me to make the rounds of the house with you, sir?
Oh, no.
Fedele will look after that.
Thank you, Eric.
Then if you don't mind, sir,
I think I'll go up to bed.
Quite all right.
Good night.
Good night, sir.
Will Your Grace have the curtains drawn?
Uh, what? Oh, no, no.
You can leave them.
Uh, put out some of the lights.
Yes, sir.
Will there be anything further,
Your Grace?
No. No, thank you,
Fedele. Good night.
Good night, sir.
Who's there?
Who's there?
Answer or I'll shoot!
[Clicks]
[Clicks]
It's quite useless against me.
Who're you?
Is this some horrible masquerade?
If it is...
[Laughing]
No.
Strange as it may seem, this is my natural appearance.
Seems incredible, doesn't it?
You see, I am not of your world.
I am... how shall I describe it?
A sort of vagabond of space.
I am the point of contact... between eternity and time.
Do I make myself clear?
[Laughing]
Evidently not.
I told you it would be difficult.
Perhaps you'd better sit.
No, no, no. Here.
Your back may need support.
You see, I am... or I was, until I crossed your threshold...
Death.
But please
be reassured.
I am not on
my usual mission tonight.
I have already stood beside one of your number tonight, without harm... that lovely girl in the garden.
Ah, then... then it was you!
Yes.
Doesn't that reassure you that
I have no fatal intentions?
Yes, yes, it-it does, rather.
That's better.
In a moment, we shall be,
I trust, quite good friends.
I am about to take a holiday.
I shall take only three days.
After that,
I must go back.
Why... why do you do this?
For a number of reasons.
For one thing, to discover why men fear me as they do.
[Gasps]
Do-Don't you know?
How should I know?
What could terror mean to me who have nothing to fear?
Can you conceive how weary I am
of always being misunderstood?
I see things that are gracious... and young and fragrant.
But if I come too near, if they feel the presence of my shadow, a horror comes upon their minds.
If I touch a flower, it dies in my grasp.
Can you conceive
how lonely I am... when there is nothing that doesn't shun me, that doesn't fade as I come near?
Yes. Yes, of course.
There is something here to be known and felt... something desirable that makes men fear me and cling to their life.
I must know what it is.
Will you accept me for these few days as a guest?
As a guest!
Oh, don't be alarmed!
As a mortal, of course.
I assure you, I shall be quite a man of the world.
Yes, oh, well, of course in that case, I, uh...
I should be most happy.
That's extremely kind of you.
Will it be a great trouble for you to put me up?
Well?
Oh, no, no, no.
Not at all, not at all!
L-l-I have a suite of rooms prepared for an old friend who is expected... uh, Prince Sirki.
Indeed? Prince Sirki of Vitalba Alexandri?
Yes.
Prince Sirki will not come to see you... not in this life.
Oh, l... I understand.
Was the Prince known to your family and your guests?
No.
Excellent!
I shall be Prince Sirki of Vitalba Alexandri for three days.
What?
Please understand that my presence in your house will not be a menace, but a protection.
Thank you.
On one condition, on which I shall insist.
Yes?
I am to be Prince Sirki, no other.
I shall be a mortal, and
I must be treated as a mortal in every particular.
No one under this roof shall show repulsion or fear, on pain of my instant displeasure.
I understand.
If my secret is divulged,
I shall leave instantly... and return in my proper person.
Do I make myself clear this time?
L-I understand,
Y-Your Highness.
I am to become a mortal.
I shall feel blood in my veins, the warm blood of life.
I shall feel my desire becoming flesh... and my hunger taking on the fire of blood.
I shall know what you know and feel what you feel.
My hunger shall be appeased
for an hour... my hunger that is as old as time.
And those that I love need not be afraid.
Not afraid!
Not afraid!
[Laughing]
I am beside myself.
My holiday is just caprice... a mad joke I play with life.
But what a monstrous, what a sublime joke!
I, Death, do hereby take on the world, the flesh and the devil!
Stop him, stop him!
Your Grace, what is it?
Corrado, for heaven's sake!
Corrado, stop, man!
Come back instantly!
Shall I call the servants,
Your Grace?
No, no. Turn on the lights.
What is it?
What's happened?
We heard shots.
Lambert, are you hurt?
No, no one's hurt.
Fedele?
Yes, sir?
Prepare the rooms in the left wing.
That was a messenger.
We... we are to have a visitor.
A messenger?
Father, are you all right?
Yes. Yes. L...
I don't see why your pistol fired.
Mine didn't.
What do you mean?
Oh. Oh, nothing, nothing.
Will somebody quit firing cannon under my windows?
I was just on the point of getting to sleep.
Fedele, I told you to get those rooms ready instantly!
Rooms for whom?
He said something about a guest.
Corrado saw a fellow running in the garden, and fired at him.
Now it turns out he was a messenger.
Yes, yes, that's it.
He was a messenger from... from Prince Sirki.
Ooh, so he's coming at last.
Yes, he's coming, all right.
You shouldn't fire at people you don't know.
No, you-you might have angered him.
Hmm.
I should think it might anger a man to fill him full of holes!
When is he coming,
Lambert?
Tonight...
at once.
Oh, my goodness!
L-l-I want to tell you all something very seriously.
This guest whom we're expecting is no ordinary person.
Now, if he should appear eccentric, or... or strange in any way, take no notice.
Treat him as a... as a prince and a gentleman, always.
And above all, you mustn't be afraid.
But Lambert, I don't understand.
And no matter what happens, you must never shun him, or protest, or... or run... or run.
Oh, it would do any good if you did.
You can't run
from things like that!
I don't think I want to stay here.
Oh, you must!
You-you-you must stay!
You must all remain if you value your lives... or mine, or anything else in this world.
[Fedele]
His Highness, Prince Sirki.
[All Gasping]
Sirki!
Well?
Uh, welcome, Your Highness, to the Villa of Contentment.
Thank you, my dear duke.
I am happy to be here.
We are more than honored,
Your Highness.
And now, may I present my wife...
La Duchessa
di Catolica.
Your Highness is most welcome.
Thank you.
I have rarely been so charmingly received.
And now, Your Highness, may I present the rest of my guests?
It would be a pleasure.
La Contessa di Parma.
May I say that I had not realized that the women of your country were so beautiful.
Your Highness is most kind.
I wish that we might never meet... when you are less beautiful, and I must be... less kind.
Miss Rhoda Fenton,
Your Highness.
Ah, young and firm and full of life!
And it lies so trustingly in mine! Hmm.
Thank you, Miss Fenton.
You have done me a kindness tonight.
The Baron Cesarea, sir.
A statesman important in the affairs of the world, who now looks back upon a long and interesting life.
I am delighted to meet the baron, at last.
And I to meet you,
Your Highness.
Considering your distinction and age, it is surprising that fate has not introduced us before.
Uh, Mr. Eric Bagley,
Your Highness.
My son, Corrado.
Ah, the son who drives so furiously!
[Laughing]
My friends... permit me to call you my friends.
[All]
Your Highness.
Make no change in your plans because of my sudden appearance.
I should like to join in your pleasures, if I may.
I beg you not to make a stranger of me.
Oh, uh, well, will... will Your Highness... will Your Highness take some little refreshment?
Uh, refreshment?
Yes, a glass of wine.
Oh. Oh, yes.
Yes, a glass of wine.
Yes, yes. Corrado!
Oh, let me do it.
Ah.
I have never tasted wine... of your country!
May I drink to this delightful household?
I believe that is one of your customs, is it not?
It is, Your Highness, and for myself and my guests, I thank you.
Oh, no, allow me.
Your Highness.
Thank you.
To this household, to life, and to all brave illusion.
Yes, wait a minute.
Ah, I think I shall enjoy your wine.
It goes pleasantly in my veins.
Yes, it is a consolation at times.
Hmm, you see?
Already I have learned one fact of importance.
[Fedele] The rooms are
ready, Your Grace.
Oh, yes.
My rooms?
Uh, yes, Your Highness.
At your pleasure.
Mmm. If you will forgive me,
I think I will go now.
Good night, my friends.
[All]
Good night, Your Highness.
My holiday begins most agreeably.
Your Highness, may I present the Princess of San Luca... and her daughter, Grazia.
[Birds Chirping]
[Man]
Principessa! Principessa!
A miracle! A miracle!
In the night, the autumn bush is covered with fresh roses!
We must send tidings to the priest. He will want to bless the sacred bush.
I'm afraid the good father will be very busy.
Look, all the bushes and vines have fresh buds!
Good morning!
Good morning,
Your Highness.
[Drawer Crashing To Floor]
[Whispers]
Damn!
Are you getting up?
Say, there's
something wrong about this.
It's only 9:30, and you never get up before 12:00.
Go to sleep, darling.
Oh, I remember!
We're to have breakfast on the terrace.
He's here... the prince.
Well?
Nothing, except you meant to steal a march on me!
Not at all, my dear.
You're a very sound sleeper.
I tried and tried to wake you.
I did sleep.
You know, this is going to be one of my good days.
I hope so, Rhoda dear, for you sake.
Pretty.
Where'd you get it?
You can't have him, my dear, so you needn't plan on it.
How far do you go, as a rule?
Well, with him... anything.
- Wait for me till I have my bath?
- Nope.
All right.
It's a war!
Wear your prettiest thing, darling!
Princess!
I'm not myself a princess, you know.
Let me call you so.
In mockery?
No, no, quite really.
You shall have a rose for that.
Oh, no, no! They wither on me.
There are people like that, you know, who-who wither the flowers they wear. Please!
This one's hardly opened yet.
It'll last a long time.
This... Uh,
Thank you.
[Chuckles]
Good morning!
Good morning, my dear.
Good morning,
Your Highness.
Good morning!
You slept well,
I trust?
As I never slept before!
Uh, Grazia, you will breakfast with us?
No, lazybones.
I had my breakfast hours ago.
What will Your Highness take for breakfast?
Well, to tell the truth,
I have never given much thought to my diet.
May l... may I suggest a little...
Cora, have you seen my other shoe?
Why don't you wear another pair?
No, these match my dress so nicely.
Why, here's your shoe, my dear!
I was sitting on it all the time!
You! Oh...
Oh!
Good morning, good morning!
You're looking well, Baron.
Last night I suddenly said to myself, "Why get older?
Why give into it?"
And from that moment,
I've felt younger.
Hmm.
And it seems to be linked with your arrival.
You're not a physician,
by any chance?
I, uh, have something in common with them.
You know, not in years have I felt as I do this morning about food, and about everything.
A little of that, Fedele, thank you. I've had to be careful... about eating and drinking... no appetite.
Indeed.
I've been much too careful.
From now on, I'm going to act like the young bloods... eat, drink and make love.
[Laughing]
Who's the lucky girl, Baron?
Never mind, now, never mind!
You keep out of my way, you young whippersnapper!
Be careful, Eric.
Don't cross him!
I shall be a four-bottle man again.
You know what that means?
Very well.
I have known many four-bottle men.
[Chuckles]
They were so cheerful.
- They were not even afraid of me.
- Afraid of you?
Well, I, uh...
I have been known to inspire fear.
So sorry, darling!
Good morning, good morning!
Good morning!
How are you?
Good morning!
No, no, Your Highness.
Don't get up.
I'm simply starved!
No wonder, darling, the way you rushed dressing.
Well, come along.
Move over!
What?
Give me some room, please!
And how are you this glorious morning?
Very well, thank you.
Have any of you seen this account of the man... who jumped off the Eiffel Tower last night and picked himself up unhurt?
No. Poor fellow!
Tsk, tsk, tsk.
He was probably desperately unhappy.
I should do something about that.
You?
I, uh... I might write him a note of condolence.
What a divine sense of humor!
I am glad somebody is beginning to realize that.
But seriously,
I feel somehow personally responsible.
As if you'd neglected something.
Exactly!
Well, it just wasn't time for the Old Man to take him.
I beg your pardon,
"the Old Man"?
Oh! Oh, yes, the Old Man!
[Laughing]
I can assure you that if the Old Man were always so neglectful, there would be serious overcrowding.
I think that's a possibility most of us would be willing to risk.
Then, there's this situation on the Algerian front.
Big night attack planned, then nothing functions.
Something wrong with the powder.
Don't worry,
my friend.
Your sacred privilege of blowing each other to bits... is quite safe.
[Stephanie]
Good morning, good morning.
[All] Good morning!
Ah, the mother of the beautiful Grazia!
Good morning.
- Maria feels they must go home.
- Some of your guests are leaving?
Th-Th-The Princess and Grazia were only here for the night,
Your Highness.
Uh, Maria, won't you consider remaining a little longer?
We shall miss you, you know.
I'm sorry.
No. No we shall.
Good-bye.
Good-bye.
I'm to go home at once, it seems.
I am sorry.
You're not to be here long?
Three days, in all.
Coming, darling?
Yes, Corrado.
Good-bye,
Your Highness.
Good-bye.
I'm afraid
I'm sorry to go.
It has been a great pleasure.
Come, dear.
The car's waiting.
Good-bye.
Good-bye.
Good-bye, Grazia.
Your Highness, they were not house guests.
They were only here last night because... because Grazia had been very frightened.
Ah, yes... in the garden.
Yes.
She is so young.
And so lovely.
It is well for you, my friend, that she went reluctantly.
Your Highness, you forbid me to tell them who you are.
My control is not absolute!
It is unimportant.
She will return.
Prince Sirki, it's such a gorgeous day.
How shall we spend it?
Is that what one does with a day... spend it?
Mmm. In my time, we merely filled in the days.
We spent the nights.
[Laughing]
Ah, your days were glamorous,
Cesarea!
Five beautiful creatures depended on me, all at one time, for their pleasure... and profit.
Think of the fatigue!
Come on, we're going to see that your three days are never to be forgotten.
No? Countess Alda, are you not coming?
Oh, yes, I'm still in the party.
Mm-hmm.
I suggest we go to the Villa Surbolonie for lunch.
No, then we'll miss the yacht races.
[Screaming]
[Bell Rings]
[Crowd Screams]
- [Crowd Screams]
- Oh!
[Screaming Continues]
Oh, my!
I can't believe it!
It's a miracle they weren't all killed!
I know I saw that horse step on him.
Perhaps it, uh... it just was not time for the Old Man to take him, hmm?
[Chuckles]
[Crowd Reacts, Exclaims]
Positively, you must come over and watch him!
He's doubled seven times on the six.
If he's right once more he'll own the place!
[Croupier]
Six!
But you shouldn't double again.
Shouldn't I?
Oh, no.
You'll lose it all!
Shall I or not?
Yes, play it.
I think the world's all yours tonight, to do with as you choose.
Shall I?
Yes, play it.
Play it all!
Your Highness, I am very sorry, it's against the rules of the house to double again.
Well, but you make it... you make it necessary... for me to take a great deal of this... this metal away with me.
I'm sorry,
Your Highness.
Oh, thank you!
[Croupier]
Thanks, Your Highness.
[Woman]
Giving it to me?
For me?
Me too!
[Croupier]
All down.
He must be very rich!
He's very exciting, but we don't seem to be to him.
Out here is the night, crowded with beauty... and you herd inside in smoky rooms, feverish over little games... why?
Why, one comes here to gamble, and one gambles to win.
Hmm.
It seems to me that men have not begun to discover the magnificence of this life.
Will you tell me what in the world you're looking for?
I came here looking for a game to play... a game worth playing.
I have been among you two days, and what you do with yourselves... still seems so very futile and empty.
There are only three games:
Money, love and war.
Have you tried war?
[Laughs]
Plenty of it.
I could never make out what it was they were fighting about.
It's usually a flag, isn't it?
Or a barren piece of ground that neither side wants.
Well, I suppose they... they fight to make themselves heroic for someone they love.
Ah, so!
It all comes down to one game.
One game... that's what it comes to.
Hmm.
One never grows tired of love.
Shall I tell you something,
Baron?
This last great game of yours, this of which you never tire, seems to me to be the strangest, the saddest, the emptiest of all.
Can it be that you're inexperienced in such matters?
Entirely.
Oh. You don't know what you've missed.
One pair of lips will change your mind for you someday.
Whose mind do you want changed?
I'm good at that.
Hah!
I have found the Americans a most engaging race.
Yes?
They proceed with such disarming directness toward what they want.
And right now, this American wants to walk in the garden.
You'll excuse us?
Certainly.
I'm the last man in the world to interfere with romance.
[Chuckles]
[Sighing]
You know, uh, I have had
great pleasure... in watching you these... these two days.
Thank you.
It is peculiarly refreshing to me to be near someone... who is so... so very fit, huh?
Well, I do have that to recommend me.
I am healthy.
And I have known so much of illness that l...
I take a singular interest in young and budding life... in vigor, in bloom.
Oh, please don't stop.
In what key shall I go on?
Say anything.
Uh, Miss Fenton, what-what is love?
What does it mean to you?
Why... why to find some splendid man who loves you too.
Like myself, perhaps?
Yes.
And to live with him the rest of your life.
Um, but if the rest of one's life... were only a few days or a few hours, would that be enough to justify love?
What a morbid idea!
Morbid?
You know,
I've noticed that about you.
You're inclined to be a little...
Well, perhaps it's the foreigner in you.
And, uh, you find the trait distasteful.
Oh, no. I think you're fascinating.
Uh, at any rate, l...
I have your answer.
Why, I don't remember saying no.
I suppose what
I really meant is, uh, that I am not a marrying man.
Oh, is that all!
I don't care.
I don't care, really, with you.
I don't care at all.
Hmm, it's interesting... very.
What?
What such a suggestion does to one.
This strange... almost the beginning of an emotion... which one feels.
Did you bring me out here to analyze me?
Yes, or to analyze myself, perhaps.
But it is amazing how the pulses stir at the mention of such subjects.
Even with me!
Yes!
I did not believe the baron, but this promises to be really interesting.
So you've discussed it all with the baron!
Oh, there is no doubt of it...
I have offended you!
You have!
Forgive me.
Oh, easily.
If I'm not your type, well,
I'm just not your type!
The baron will be disappointed.
[Clock Chiming]
His Eminence,
Cardinal de Valle.
Their Excellencies,
the Ambassador of Spain
and Madame Monte.
Kind of Your Eminence to come.
I am glad to be with you.
Excellency.
Hello, Signor, Duchessa.
Mademoiselle,
vous etes ravissante.
Comme un reve.
Yes?
Vos yeux sont
tres brillants.
Well, I don't know just what that means in English, but if it sounds like the French...
Your Highness perhaps does not care for dancing?
Oh, yes.
I found it somewhat stifling inside.
I had hoped to make your last evening, uh...
Yes, my last evening.
I leave at midnight.
[Sighing]
Don't let me keep you from your guests.
[Clears Throat]
Eric, who is this Prince?
What is he, he draws and frightens us all so?
Alda, are you in love with him?
Fascinated, completely.
My darling, can't you think yourself out of this?
It's not only that I'm jealous, but I'm worried about you.
Come on. Let's dance.
I'm too restless to dance.
Let's go into the garden, then.
Not now.
Dreaming?
Yes, things impossible.
Tell me.
You are so fortunate here.
I think I used to despise you all, with your little whims and desires, all leading up to nothing.
Now there is nothing
I want so much as to share them, and I cannot.
I was just thinking all that of myself.
[Chuckles]
My dear countess, you can have whatever dreams you wish.
But suppose you had been set down, for a few hours or a few days, among the inhabitants of the moon, and that was all the life you could have forever... you knew no one there, and no one dared to know you?
Do you really feel that?
I am not one of you.
Then I wish that you were.
You do?
I've waited for someone like you.
Even though I am not what I seem?
You are, though.
No.
I am a fear, a shadow, a wandering thing.
Isn't there a story among your legends... of a merman who came asking a woman to love him... so that he might have a soul?
Well, if there is,
I'm sure she gave him what he asked.
She'd give up her own soul gladly.
If she were in love.
Yes, if she were in love.
You see, I have come asking for that.
Of me?
Yes.
But also, it is impossible.
Why?
Because you will take one step toward me... and know my secret, and lose courage.
Try me.
You can give me a soul only if you know me and can still love me.
Look into my eyes.
Look deep.
What do you see there?
Shadows.
Look into those shadows.
Let your thought go to its wildest reach.
I will you to know who I am!
No, no!
I want to live!
Eric! Eric!
[Gasping, Sobbing]
Eric! Eric!
What is it, darling?
What's the matter?
I don't know, only keep me away from him!
There's no danger, darling.
What danger could there be?
Oh, keep back... keep back all of you!
How do you know when he'll strike?
Alda, Alda, be quiet!
Why, there's nothing to harm you!
Alda, my dear.
Tell me what's happened.
Nothing! I don't know!
I don't know!
Sir, it's evident that your presence here is unwelcome.
It has been made apparent in many ways.
Why are you among us?
Corrado, he's my guest!
Guest or not, I'll ask him what I like, and he'll answer.
My father says he has cause to fear you. Who are you?
Corrado!
I'm afraid I have no answer for you, nor for anyone.
I warn you, however...
I've heard that warning before.
Would you threaten the stars because you dislike your destiny?
I came among you to warm my hands at your fires... your poor, pitiful little fires that flicker out in the night.
Well, let them all go out!
One means no more to me than another.
Let them all go out, if only I can save one spark for the eternal cold!
Go. Go, Corrado.
Go instantly.
Let me speak to His Highness.
Corrado.
Grazia's here.
She's looking for you.
All right, Mother.
Your Highness,
I hope that you...
I have been caught in this web of flesh,
Duke Lambert... caught and tortured.
I thought to put it on like a garment and cast it off as easily.
But to put it off is to die... to die without having lived!
To die alone, without loving or being loved, and that I will not have.
But your promise... your promise to harm no one.
What does my promise matter when I set it against this torture I feel?
What if there should be one death among you?
You have years to live, have you not?
Years!
And I have what remains of this day.
The very lovely and serene princess of all delight.
My name is Grazia.
How charming of you.
Grazia, then.
You make it sound like music.
It is like music.
It has overtones that go singing on and on.
But they are not sad.
They are full of grace and light.
When you speak like that,
I hear music, too... great sweeping chords.
May I?
I could say so much more.
Your Highness is being very kind tonight.
Hmm.
I wonder if I am... being kind.
Perhaps I should have said gracious.
No, no.
Not gracious, either.
I have learned that even the mightiest... must sue for certain favors.
Well, perhaps you're unfamiliar with this custom, also.
When a gentleman is tapped on the shoulder, he releases the lady to another partner.
[Exhales]
I am grateful for the explanation.
I myself have touched many shoulders, but, uh, for other reasons.
Grazia, why did you come?
Oh, I don't know.
I kept wanting to.
I wanted to see you too, but...
I didn't want you to come just now.
Will you do me a great favor?
If I can.
May I stay close to you this evening?
Why?
Because...
I love you, and I'm afraid.
But there's nothing to be afraid of,
Corrado.
You don't know.
Yes, I do.
And I'm happy to be here.
I wanted to come.
You mean you know what we're afraid of?
Yes.
And it doesn't frighten you?
No.
Grazia, come back to me.
There's some terrible danger.
No, not danger... happiness.
[Whispers]
Grazia.
Please don't be unhappy,
Corrado.
I love you in some way
I can't quite make clear.
If I didn't feel so far away,
I'd be in your arms now, crying and holding you close to me.
I want to do that, but somehow,
I think I never shall.
Grazia, you're trembling.
I feel a little cold.
Will you get my cloak from the hall?
Yes.
Yes, of course.
The buffet is served, Eccellenza.
What?
Oh, yes.
Yes, thank you, Fedele.
[Speaking Italian]
You are cold.
Yes.
Grazia!
Father, what is it?
What?
Oh, nothing, nothing.
Where are you going?
Why, Grazia wanted her cloak.
Oh, no. Not now.
Why? Why not?
Prince Sirki has brought her a cloak.
Prince Sirki!
Father, she's hypnotized, fascinated.
We must save her from him!
No, we can do nothing.
What do you mean?
If we could, should I be standing here now?
Lambert, what is it?
Oh, nothing, nothing.
Grazia's gone out into the garden with Prince Sirki.
Prince Sirki? Why not?
What's wrong?
Oh, Grazia's in no danger.
What's happened, sir?
There's nothing to be alarmed about.
But you're alarmed, Father.
You're terrified.
There is some danger.
Oh, let me go to her.
No, no. Wait, wait.
Then I'll go.
No, I forbid you.
You're risking your life.
My life... what's my life or yours? You said you'd die for Grazia.
I would if it would save her.
Father, tell me who this prince is.
I'll know or I'll kill him!
Kill him!
Why, if he but put out his hand, it'd mean your life.
I don't care. I only know that Grazia's in danger.
No, no! Wait, wait, wait!
He's not Prince Sirki! He...
No, no. Don't tell, don't tell!
He is the one whom all men dread.
He is Death!
What do you mean?
His Majesty, Death, amusing himself on a holiday.
No, no, Lambert!
Amusing himself with love.
Now, you take one step to save her and she's lost.
If you won't think of yourselves, think of her.
Perhaps you can tell me what I have been doing.
I think I can, almost.
Tell me.
I think you've been holding life in your hands, as I do sometimes.
I think you've been a little afraid of its beauty.
Oh, you do know.
Child.
Child, something new has been born in me, and I know the meaning of this life men lead here.
A moment ago I knew only that men were dust, and their end was dust.
And now suddenly
I know for the first time... that men bear a dream within them... a dream that lifts them above their dust... and their little days.
And you have brought this to me.
I look at the stars in the water, Grazia, and you have given them a meaning.
I feel the earth under me.
It's no longer the earth which men become, but a world which you have made for me which we share together.
And yet,
I am alone too.
Still alone.
I think we'll never be alone again.
It comes easily to you, Grazia.
But for me,
I shall hear your laughter in every wind that passes.
I shall hear your footsteps wherever you are, when our two worlds hold us apart.
Why should we ever be apart?
Oh, what is this that's happened?
Who are you?
- Sirki.
- I don't mean that.
You seem to come from a distant place.
When I'm with you,
I see depths in your eyes that are like the worlds
I visit in sleep, and beneath your words is a sound I've heard in dreams.
And when you leave me, the light goes from the sky.
You're like the mystery that's just beyond sight and sound, always just beyond my reach.
Something that draws and... and frightens me.
Oh, Grazia,
Grazia, don't be afraid of me.
I am Sirki who loves you, more than any man could love you.
I am Sirki who needs your warmth and your beauty... more than any man could need it.
I say your name over and over, until the music runs through my soul.
Listen to me, Grazia.
I am a great power, and I am humble before you.
And tonight
I must go back to my... my distant kingdom.
Will you take me with you?
Take you?
I should be so unhappy... alone.
Take you?
Oh, no, no.
Don't tempt me.
But Grazia, give me one hour of you.
Let me hold you once and feel your life.
You are the meaning of beauty that I must know.
Oh, Grazia, let me hold you, let me feel that last ecstasy... and know that I have lived.
Oh, my love!
My love!
[Chiming]
Do you think he'll surely come?
Oh, yes.
I think he'll come back and say goodbye to his friends.
But Grazia...
I don't know.
Perhaps he will be kind.
He may take Grazia, or... all of us.
We have courage for that, sir.
I think you're all wrong to be afraid.
I talked to him about dying, and he said,
"Has it ever occurred to you that death may be simpler than life,
"and infinitely more kind?"
He said that?
Yes.
And when he spoke,
I had a curious feeling that somehow he knew.
[Door Opens]
So, you have broken your promise.
Yes. I was desperate, sir.
It was my son's life against my promise.
I had no choice.
I am not used to these distinctions!
I thought we should part as friends, with kindly remembrances, but now my shadow has come between us.
Surely not already.
No.
I am a mortal, still, for a few minutes.
No longer as Prince Sirki of Vitalba Alexandri, but as myself, with my own feelings.
In a few moments,
I shall be what I was, and for me, too, there will be an end.
But you're above pain and loss.
Am I?
I thought tonight
I had reached the end of my experiment.
I had found love.
But it was not the end.
Beyond that, I have found the pain of losing love... if I must lose it.
But it must be lost to you!
Why?
Because you are...
Death!
Death!
[Laughs]
My dear duke, thank you for defining the problem.
Your Highness, won't you give her back to me?
You who have been cruel often, will be again.
But must you be cruel to me this one time?
It's your pain against mine.
But I gave her to life!
To life, not to...
Why should I deny myself because of your childish fear?
You know nothing of the meaning of death.
You're speaking of your own need, not hers.
I'm asking for her life.
A life which I must sometime take.
But she's so young!
I tell you, to go with me now, in love, would be triumph, not death as it is known to you.
Oh, in God's name!
Lambert!
Give her back to me.
One lover must always lose.
But not like this, not with death.
There are worlds between us, and I cannot reach your minds.
Why do men fear my coming?
You have ten minutes more of life.
After that, what can you give her?
Sleep, perhaps, and the release of dreams.
And beyond that...
There are no words by which to tell you.
But that is death to us, and to her.
A word you have been taught to fear.
A symbol of the unknown, and because of that word, you would keep her from me.
I would only lead her through the gateway... to the life that lies beyond.
Your Highness, we are not answered.
Are we to keep Grazia?
- Is she yours even now?
- But she doesn't know who you are.
Now, if she knew, what would she choose?
Yes, even Grazia was born to fear the face of death.
She would die with me now, as Sirki.
- I cannot tell her!
- You gave me your word.
And you think me bound by that?
I do. An honorable man would be bound.
Because I assume your flesh, must I assume your weakness, too?
Then pity our weakness.
I've seen pity struggling in you.
We beg the life of Grazia.
I bound myself to life, and with it to the little rules by which it is lived.
And now I must bow to it.
What a monstrous comedy!
Where's he going?
To fetch Grazia.
Oh, what will he do?
What will he do?
Oh, now, now.
Wait, Maria. Wait.
She will come.
You will give her back?
No! It is for you to call her back.
For us?
Shh!
She is coming.
Your Highness, did you call?
Grazia!
Oh, Grazia, darling,
I've been so frightened!
So frightened!
Grazia, don't run away like that again, not in the night.
But I was quite safe with him, Mother.
I love to be with him.
I must stay with him always.
I know he seems a little terrifying to you, but I'm happy with him, and safe.
He's kind, Mother, and more tender than anyone I've ever known... even more tender than you.
Don't, Grazia.
You don't know what you're saying.
Why are you all so strange?
Why are you suffering so?
I've found my love.
There ought to be lights and music.
Save her!
Tell her what you will.
What is there to tell?
Do you think there's anything
I don't understand?
I love His Highness, and I must go with him.
Your Highness, you must.
Say what you like.
It will make no difference.
You must!
It's nearly twelve!
I know.
Grazia, I came to this house as a jest, made love to you as a jest.
You're trying to destroy my love because they wish it.
- It was not a jest.
- Someone tell her quickly, while there's time.
Corrado, she's cold.
Take her in your arms.
Grazia, Grazia, don't you hear me?
Yes, I hear.
Grazia, dear, won't you stay with me?
I can't, Corrado.
But I shall always love you.
Grazia, listen.
You must stay here with those who love you.
If you went with me now, you could never see them again.
Why must you say these things to me?
They can make no difference.
But you don't understand.
My holiday is over.
I am going at once.
I'm ready.
Oh, no.
You can't come with me.
Yes, I can.
Shall we go now?
But you... you don't know who I am!
You are my love... my love!
You heard?
And you wish me to speak and destroy this happiness?
You must.
[Clock Chimes]
Oh, Grazia, my little love, it was not a jest.
[Clock Chimes]
[Collective Gasp]
Goodbye, my friends.
Remember that there is only a moment of shadow... between your life and mine.
And when I call, come bravely through that shadow...
[Clock Chimes]
And you will find me only your familiar friend.
Goodbye, Grazia.
[Clock Chimes]
Now you see me as I am.
But I've always seen you like that.
You haven't changed.
You have seen me... like this?
Yes, always.
Then there is a love which casts out fear, and I have found it!
And love is greater than illusion... and as strong as death.
Slave in the Magic Mirror, come from the farthest space.
Through wind and darkness,
I summon thee.
Speak!
Let me see thy face.
What wouldst thou know, my Queen?
Magic Mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all?
Famed is thy beauty, Majesty.
But hold, a lovely maid I see.
Rags cannot hide her gentle grace.
Alas, she is more fair than thee.
Alas for her! Reveal her name.
Lips red as the rose.
Hair black as ebony.
Skin white as snow.
Snow White!
Want to know a secret?
Promise not to tell?
We are standing by a wishing well
Make a wish into the well
That's all you have to do
And if you hear it echoing
Your wish will soon come true
- I'm wishing
- I'm wishing
For the one I love
- To find me
- To find me
- Today
- Today
- I'm hoping
- I'm hoping
And I'm dreaming of
- The nice things
- The nice things
- He'll say
- He'll say
- I'm wishing
- I'm wishing
For the one I love
- To find me
- To find me
- Today
- Today
- Oh!
- Hello.
- Oh.
- Did I frighten you?
Wait! Wait, please.
Don't run away.
Now that I've found you
Hear what I have to say
One song
I have but one song
One song only for you
One heart tenderly beating
Ever entreating
Constant and true
One love
That has possessed me
One love
Thrilling me through
One song
My heart keeps singing
Of one love
Only for you
Take her far into the forest.
Find some secluded glade where she can pick wildflowers.
Yes, Your Majesty.
And there, my faithful Huntsman, you will kill her!
But, Your Majesty, the little Princess!
Silence!
You know the penalty if you fail.
Yes, Your Majesty.
But to make doubly sure you do not fail, bring back her heart in this.
One song,
I have but one song
Hello there.
What's the matter?
Where's your mama and papa?
Why, I believe you're lost.
Oh, please don't cry.
Come on, perk up.
Won't you smile for me?
That's better.
Your mama and papa can't be far.
There they are!
Can you fly?
Good-bye. Good-bye!
I can't, I can't do it.
Forgive me.
I beg of Your Highness, forgive me.
I don't understand!
She's mad, jealous of you!
She'll stop at nothing!
- But, but who?
- The Queen.
- The Queen?
- Now, quick, child, run.
Run away, hide!
In the woods! Anywhere!
Never come back!
Now, go. Go! Go!
Run! Run! Hide!
Oh!
Please don't run away.
I won't hurt you.
I'm awfully sorry.
I didn't mean to frighten you.
But you don't know what I've been through.
And all because I was afraid.
I'm so ashamed of the fuss I've made.
What do you do when things go wrong?
Oh! You sing a song!
With a smile and a song
Life is just like a bright, sunny day
Your cares fade away
And your heart is young
With a smile and a song
All the world seems to waken anew
Rejoicing with you
As the song is sung
There's no use in grumbling
When raindrops come tumbling
Remember you're the one
Who can fill the world with sunshine
When you smile and you sing
Everything is in tune and it's spring
And life flows along
With a smile and a song
I really feel quite happy now.
I'm sure I'll get along somehow.
Everything's going to be all right.
But I do need a place to sleep at night.
I can't sleep in the ground like you or in a tree the way you do.
And I'm sure no nest would possibly be big enough for me.
Maybe you know where I can stay.
In the woods somewhere?
You do?
Will you take me there?
Oh, it's adorable!
Just like a doll's house.
I like it here.
Ooh, it's dark inside.
Guess there's no one home.
Hello?
May I come in?
Shh!
Oh!
What a cute little chair!
Why, there's seven little chairs!
Must be seven little children.
And from the look of this table, seven untidy little children.
A pickaxe. A stocking, too!
And a shoe!
And just look at that fireplace.
It's covered with dust.
And look, cobwebs everywhere!
My, my, my!
What a pile of dirty dishes!
And just look at that broom!
Why, they've never swept this room.
You'd think their mother would...
Maybe they have no mother.
Then they're orphans.
That's too bad.
I know!
We'll clean the house and surprise them.
Then maybe they'll let me stay.
Now, you wash the dishes.
You tidy up the room.
You clean the fireplace.
And I will use the broom.
Just whistle while you work
And cheerfully together we can tidy up the place
So hum a merry tune
It won't take long when there's a song to help you set the pace
And as you sweep the room
Imagine that the broom
Is someone that you love and soon you'll find you're dancing to the tune
Oh, no, no, no, no! Put them in the tub.
When hearts are high the time will fly
So whistle while you work
Uh-uh, uh-uh!
Not under the rug.
So whistle while you work
We dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig
In our mine the whole day through
To dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig is what we like to do
It ain't no trick to get rich quick
If ya dig, dig, dig with a shovel or a pick
- In a mine
- In a mine
Where a million diamonds
- Shine
We dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig
From early morn 'til night
We dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig up everything in sight
We dig up diamonds by the score
A thousand rubies
Sometimes more
Though we don't know what we dig 'em for
We dig, dig, dig-a-dig, dig
Heigh-ho

Let's see what's upstairs.
Oh, what adorable little beds!
And look, they have their names carved on them.
Doc, Happy,
Sneezy, Dopey...
What funny names for children!
Grumpy, Bashful and Sleepy.
I'm a little sleepy myself.
Oh! Oh!

Look!
Our house! The lit's light...
Uh, the light's lit.
Jiminy Crickets!
The door is open.
The chimney's smoking.
Something's in there.
- Maybe a ghost.
- Or a goblin.
- A demon.
Or a dragon.
Mark my words, there's trouble a-brewin'.
Felt it coming all day. My corns hurt.
- Gosh!
- That's a bad sign.
What'll we do?
- Let's sneak up on it.
Yes.
We'll, uh, squeak up... Sneak up.
Come on, hen... Uh, men. Follow me.
Psst!
Shh!
Shh!
Careful, men.
Search every cook and nanny...
Hook and granny...
Crooked fan...
Search everywhere.
Shh!
Quiet.
Look! The floor, it's been swept!
Hah!
Chair's been dusted!
Our window's been washed.
Gosh, our cobwebs are missing.
Why, why, why, why, the whole place is clean!
There's dirty work afoot.
Sink's empty.
Hey, someone stole our dishes!
They ain't stole.
They're hid in the cupboard.
My cup's been washed.
Sugar's gone.
Something's cooking.
Smells good!
Don't touch it, you fools!
Might be poison.
See? It's witches' brew.
Look what's happened to our stable... Uh, table.
Flowers!
- Huh?
- Look, goldenrod.
Don't do it. Take them away.
My nose! My hay fever!
You know I can't stand it.
I can't... I can't... I... Oh.
Ah...
Ahhh...
Thanks!
Hey!
Shh!
Ya crazy fool!
Fine time you picked to sneeze!
I couldn't help it. I can't tell.
When you gotta, you gotta.
I... I... I gotta.
It's coming.
- Don't let him.
- Stop him.
Oh! Ah... Ah... Ah!
- No, tie it tight.
- Don't let go.
- Hold him tight.
- I'll tie it.
Make a hard knot.
There, that will hold him.
- Thanks!
- Shh!
Quiet, you fool!
You want to get us all killed?
- What's that?
- That's it.
- Sounded close.
- It's in this room right now.
- It's up there.
- Yeah. In the bedroom.
One of us has gotta go down and chase it up.
Up. Down.
Here, take it.
Don't be nervous.
Don't be afraid. We're right behind you.
Yes! Right behind ya.
Here it comes!
- It's after us.
- Don't let it out.
Hold it shut.
- Here it comes.
- Now's our chance.
Get it now!
- Quick!
- Give it to it!
Don't let it get away!
Hold on there. It's only Dopey.
- Did you see it?
- How big is it?
- Was it a dragon?
- Has it got horns?
- Was it breathing fire?
- Was it droolin'?
What was it doin'?
He says it's a, a monster asleep in our beds!
- Let's attack.
- While it's sleeping.
Yeah, while it's sleeping.
- Hurry, men. It's now or never!
- Off with its head.
- Break its bones.
- Chop it to pieces.
We'll kill it dead.
- Jiminy Crickets!
- Gosh!
- Gee!
- What a monster!
It covers three beds.
Let's kill it before it wakes up.
- Which end do we kill?
- Shh!
Shh!
Well, eh, ah...
- What is it?
- Why, it... It's a girl!
She's mighty purdy.
She's beautiful, just like a angel.
Angel, hah! She's a female!
And all females is poison!
They're full of wicked wiles.
What are wicked wiles?
I don't know. But I'm agin 'em.
Shh!
Not so loud. You'll wake her up.
Aw, let her wake up!
She don't belong here nohow.
- Look out.
- She's movin'.
- She's wakin' up.
- What'll we do?
Hide.
Oh, dear.
I wonder if the children are...
Oh!
Why, why, you're little men!
How do you do?
- I said, how do you do?
- How do you do what?
Oh, you can talk! I'm so glad!
Now, don't tell me who you are.
Let me guess.
I know, you're Doc.
Why, why, why, yes.
Yes! That's true.
And you're, you're Bashful.
Oh, gosh!
And you, you're Sleepy.
How'd you guess?
And you?
And you're Sneezy.
- Yes, and you must be...
- Happy, ma'am. That's me.
And this is Dopey. He don't talk none.
You mean he can't talk?
He don't know. He never tried.
Oh, that's too bad.
Oh!
You must be Grumpy.
Oh, yes! Yes!
Hah! We know who we are.
Ask her who she is and what she's a-doin' here.
Hmph! Yeah!
What are you and who are you doin'?
What are you... Who are you, my dear?
Oh, how silly of me. I'm Snow White.
Snow White?
The Princess?
Yes.
Well... Well, my, my dear Quincess... Uh, Princess.
We're, uh, we're honored.
Yes, we're, uh, we're...
- Mad as hornets!
- Mad as hornets! No, no, we're not.
We're bad as cornets...
No, no, as bad as... What was I sayin'?
Nothing! Just standin' there sputterin' like a doodlebug!
Who, who, who, who's butterin' like a spoodledug?
- Who's... Uh, gutter...
- Aw, shut up and tell her to get out!
Please don't send me away!
- If you do, she'll kill me.
Kill you?
Who will?
Yes, who?
- My stepmother, the Queen.
The Queen?
- She's wicked!
- She's bad!
- She's mighty mean!
- She's an old witch!
I'm warnin' ya.
If the Queen finds her here, she'll swoop down and wreak her vengeance on us!
But she doesn't know where I am!
She don't, eh? She knows everything.
She's full of black magic.
She can even make herself invisible.
Pfft!
Might be in this room right now.
Oh, she'll never find me here.
And if you let me stay,
I'll keep house for you.
I'll wash and sew and sweep and cook and...
Cook?
Can you make dapple lumpkins...
Uh, lumple dapplins?
Apple dumplings!
- Eh, yes!
Crapple dumpkins.
Yes, and plum pudding and gooseberry pie...
Gooseberry pie?
Hooray! She stays!
Ah!
Soup!
Hooray!
Uh-uh, uh-uh!
Just a minute.
Supper's not quite ready.
You'll just have time to wash.
Wash? Wash?
- Wash? Wash? Wash?
- Hah! Knew there was a catch to it.
- Why wash?
- What for? We ain't goin' nowhere.
'Tain't New Year's.
Oh, perhaps you have washed.
Perhaps we...
- Yes! Perhaps we have.
- But when?
When? When. Uh, you said whe...
Why, last week.
Why, recently!
Yes, recently!
Oh, recently!
Let me see your hands.
Let me see your hands!
Why, Doc, I'm surprised!
Come on, let's see them.
Oh, Bashful, my, my, my!
And you?
Worse than I thought!
Oh!
How shocking!
Goodness me, this will never do.
March straight outside and wash, or you'll not get a bite to eat.
Hah!
Well, aren't you going to wash?
What's the matter?
Cat got your tongue?
Oh! Did you hurt yourself?
Hah, women!
Courage, men, courage.
Don't be nervous.
Gosh, it's wet!
It's cold, too!
We ain't gonna do it, are we?
Well, it'll please the Princess.
I'll take a chance for her!
Me, too!
Hah! Her wiles are beginnin' to work.
But I'm warnin' ya, you give 'em an inch, and they'll walk all over ya!
Don't listen to that old warthog.
Come on now, men.
- How hard do ya scrub?
- Will our whiskers shrink?
Do ya get in the tub?
Do ya have to wash where it doesn't show?
Now, now, now, don't get excited.
Here we go.
Step up to the tub
'Tain't no disgrace
Just pull up your sleeves and get 'em in place
Then scoop up the water and rub it on your face and go...
Pick up the soap
Now don't try to bluff
Work up a lather
And when you got enough
Get your hands full of water and you snort and you snuff and go...
You douse and you souse
Rub and you scrub
You sputter and splash all over the tub
You may be cold and wet when you're done
But you gotta admit it's good and clean fun
So splash all you like
'Tain't any trick
As soon as you're through
You'll feel mighty slick
Bunch of old nanny goats.
Ya make me sick going...
Hah! Next thing ya know she'll be tyin' your beards up in pink ribbons and smellin' ya up with that stuff called "perfoom. "
Hah!
A fine bunch of water lilies you turned out to be.
I'd like to see anybody make me wash if I didn't wanna.
Get him!
Hey, let go of me!
Get him over to the tub.
Get him over to the tub.
Let me loose, you fools! Let me loose!
Get him up on the tub. Get him up!
Hang on to him! Bang him! Pound him!
Get him up on the tub! On the tub.
That's the tub. That's the tub.
Don't, don't, don't, don't get excited!
Don't get... Don't get up... Don't get...
Get the soap!
Hey, steady, men.
- We'll get him there. We'll get him.
Never say die. Never say die.
You don't...
Now, scrub good and hard
It can't be denied
That he'll look mighty cute as soon as he's dried
Well, it's good for the soul
And it's good for the hide to go...
Ain't he sweet?
Smells like a petunia.
He sure is cute!
You'll pay dearly for this!
Supper!
- Supper!
Food. Hooray!
Hah!
Magic Mirror on the wall, who now is the fairest one of all?
Over the seven jeweled hills beyond the seventh fall, in the cottage of the seven dwarfs dwells Snow White, fairest one of all.
Snow White lies dead in the forest.
The Huntsman has brought me proof.
Behold her heart.
Snow White still lives, the fairest in the land.
'Tis the heart of a pig you hold in your hand.
The heart of a pig!
Then I've been tricked!
The heart of a pig!
The blundering fool!
I'll go myself to the dwarfs' cottage in a disguise so complete no one will ever suspect.
Now, a formula to transform my beauty into ugliness, change my queenly raiment to a peddler's cloak.
Mummy Dust to make me old.
To shroud my clothes, the black of night.
To age my voice, an old hag's cackle.
To whiten my hair, a scream of fright.
A blast of wind to fan my hate!
A thunderbolt
To mix it well.
Now, begin thy magic spell.
Look!
My hands!
My voice!
My voice.
A perfect disguise.
And now...
A special sort of death for one so fair.
What shall it be?
Ah!
A poisoned apple!
Sleeping Death.
I'd like to dance and tap my feet
But they won't keep in rhythm
You see, I washed 'em both today and I can't do nothin' with 'em
Ho-hum, the tune is dumb
The words don't mean a thing
Isn't this a silly song for anyone to sing?
I...
Oh, gosh!
I chased a polecat up a tree
Way out upon a limb
And when he got the best of me
I got the worst of him
Ho-hum, the tune is dumb
The words don't mean a thing
Isn't this a silly song for anyone to sing?
Watch out. Be ca... Watch... Watch...
Watch... Watch...
Thanks.
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey!
Hooray!
That was fun!
Now you do something.
Well, what shall I do?
- Tell us a story.
Yes, tell us a story.
- A true story.
- A love story.
Well, once there was a princess.
Was the princess you?
- And she fell in love.
- Was it hard to do?
Oh, it was very easy.
Anyone could see that the Prince was charming.
The only one for me.
Was he strong and handsome?
Was he big and tall?
There's nobody like him anywhere at all.
Did he say he loved ya?
Did he steal a kiss?
He was so romantic
I could not resist
Some day my prince will come
Some day we'll meet again
And away to his castle we'll go
To be happy forever
I know
Hah! Mush!
Some day when spring is here
We'll find our love anew
And the birds will sing
And wedding bells will ring
Some day when my dreams
Come true
Oh, my goodness!
It's past bedtime.
Go right upstairs to bed.
Wait! Hold on there, men!
The, uh, Princess will sleep in our beds upstairs.
But where will you sleep?
Oh, we'll be quite comfortable down here in... in...
In a pig's eye!
In a pig's eye... Sty. No, no! I mean...
We'll be comfortable, won't we, men?
Oh, yes. Mighty comfortable.
Now don't you worry about us.
We'll be all right, ma'am.
Go right on up now, my dear.
Well, if you insist.
Good night.
Good night, Princess.
You're sure you'll be comfortable?
Oh, yes. Very comfortable.
Well, pleasant dreams.
Pleasant dreams.
Let go!
- I saw it first!
Now, men, don't get excited.
Remember, share.
It's share and share alike.
Look out, it'll rip. It'll rip!
Bless the seven little men who have been so kind to me.
And... And may my dreams come true.
Amen.
Oh, yes!
And please make Grumpy like me.
Hah! Women!
A fine kettle of fish!
Dip the apple in the brew.
Let the Sleeping Death seep through!
Look! On the skin!
The symbol of what lies within.
Now, turn red to tempt Snow White.
To make her hunger for a bite.
Have a bite?
It's not for you.
It's for Snow White.
When she breaks the tender peel to taste the apple in my hand, her breath will still, her blood congeal.
Then I'll be fairest in the land!
But wait!
There may be an antidote.
Nothing must be overlooked.
Oh, here it is!
"Love's First Kiss. "
Bah!
No fear of that.
The dwarfs will think she's dead.
She'll be buried alive!
Buried alive!
Thirsty?
Have a drink!
Now, don't forget, my dear.
The... The old Queen's a sly one, full of witchcraft.
So beware of strangers.
Don't worry. I'll be all right.
See you tonight.
Uh, yes. We... Well, c'mon, men.
Be awful careful
'cause if anything'd happen to you, I, I...
- Good-bye.
- Oh, gosh!
Hah! Disgustin'!
And be sure to watch out...
To wa... To wa...
To wa...
Watch out.
Thanks.
Well... All right.
But that's the last... Wha...
Oh, go on. Run along.
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
It's off to work we go
Heigh-ho
Good-bye! Good-bye!
Now I'm warnin' ya.
Don't let nobody or nothin' in the house.
Why, Grumpy, you do care.
Hah!
Good-bye, Grumpy!
The little men will be away and she'll be all alone with a harmless old peddler woman.
A harmless old peddler woman!
Some day my prince will come
Some day we'll meet again
And away to his castle we'll go
To be happy forever I know
Some day when spring is here
We'll find our love anew
And the birds will sing
And wedding bells will ring
Some day when my dreams
Come true
All alone, my pet?
Why, why, yes, I am. But...
The, the little men are not here?
No, they're not, but...
Mmm-hmm.
Making pies?
Yes, gooseberry pies.
It's apple pies that make the menfolks' mouths water.
Pies made from apples like these.
- Oh, they do look delicious.
- Yes!
But wait 'til you taste one, dearie.
Like to try one?
Hmm?
Go on. Go on, have a bite.
Stop it! Stop it! Go away! Go away!
Shame on you, frightening a poor old lady.
Oh, I thought I'd lost it.
There, there. I'm sorry.
Oh! My heart!
Oh, my... My poor heart.
Take me into the house and let me rest.
A drink of water, please.
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
It's off to work we go
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
Hey, look!
- Stop that!
- Get away, boy. Get away! Go on, shoo!
Go on! Get outta here!
What ails these crazy birds?
They've gone plumb daffy.
Yeah, they've...
And because you've been so good to poor old Granny,
I'll share a secret with you.
This is no ordinary apple.
It's a magic wishing apple.
A wishing apple?
Yes!
One bite and all your dreams will come true.
- Really?
- Yes, girlie.
Now, make a wish and take a bite.
- Go on, get!
- These pesky critters won't stop.
- 'Tain't natural.
There's something wrong.
They ain't actin' this way for nothin'.
Maybe the old Queen's got Snow White.
- The Queen!
Snow White!
The Queen'll kill her!
We gotta save her!
Yes! Yes! We, we, we gotta save her!
- She'll kill her!
- What'll we do?
Yes, yes, what'll we do?
Come on! Giddap!
Wait for me! Wait for...
There must be something your little heart desires.
Perhaps there's someone you love.
Well, there is someone.
I thought so. I thought so!
Old Granny knows a young girl's heart.
Now, take the apple, dearie, and make a wish.
I wish... I wish...
That's it, go on! Go on.
And that he will carry me away to his castle where we will live happily ever after.
Fine! Fine! Now take a bite.
Don't let the wish grow cold!
Oh, I feel strange.
- Her breath will still.
- Oh. Oh.
- Her blood congeal.
- Oh.
Now I'll be fairest in the land!
Hurry, hurry.
There she goes!
After her!
I'm trapped! What will I do?
The meddling little fools!
I'll fix ya. I'll fix ya.
I'll fix ya! I'll crush your bones!
Look out!
One song
One song
I have but one song
- One song
- One song
- Only for you
- For you
One heart
Tenderly beating
Ever entreating
- Constant and true
- So true
- One love
- One love
That has possessed me
- One love
- One love
- Thrilling me through
- So true
- One song
- One song
- My heart keeps singing
- Keeps singing
- Of one love
- One love
Only for you...
And away to his castle you'll go
To be happy forever we know
Good-bye.
Good-bye, Grumpy.
Good-bye.
Oh, Dopey.
Good-bye!
Some day when spring is here
We'll find our love anew
And the birds will sing
And wedding bells will ring
Some day when my dreams
Come true!
Read all about that sensational divorce case here, judge holds case behind locked doors!
Buy a paper, read all about the Topper divorce case, your daily paper.
- Now Mr. Topper the issues in the case are very funny.
During the month of August you registered for the Sea Breeze Hotel with a woman, not Mrs. Topper.
- Well, yes, and no.
- Mr. Topper once again I ask you, who was the woman with you at the Sea Breeze Hotel?
- Marion Kerby.
- Marion Kerby, Marion Kerby!
I insist that you stop trying to make a mockery of this trial!
- Now he's yelling at me.
- Kindly ask your questions in a milder tone.
- I'm sorry, Your Honor.
- You see.
- Alright, I'll put it another way.
Was there a woman with you at the Sea Breeze Hotel on August 2nd?
- Yes, and no.
- Was there or wasn't there?
- Well it's very hard to explain, but I could if you would only let me.
- Let him answer in his own way.
- Thank you, Your Honor.
I'm afraid I can't tell you just exactly what happened because I don't know myself.
It might make everything a little clearer if I started with George and Marion Kerby.
You see it all began that day in June when George and Marion drove back home.
- George look out!
- There's something in my eye.
- Something in your eye?
Be careful, look out, it'll never take us.
- Oh boy, guess I'll never hear the last of this.
- Oh, look at my car.
- Look at my hat.
- I've got a run in my stocking,
I told you to slow up, would you?
Oh no.
- Can I help it if a tire blows out?
Besides, I had something in my eye.
- Couldn't have been your driving, could it?
- I've come around that curve much faster lots of times, so have you.
- It was such a lovely car too.
George, you're getting transparent, you're fading.
- Say that's funny,
I can see through you too.
Say, who's that?
It's us!
You know something George?
I think we're dead.
- I think you're right.
I hope we go together, honey.
- So do I.
- Marion, what do you suppose is the conventional thing to do now?
- I don't know.
We've never been conventional.
- I think we tell someone our good deeds, and then they open up the beautiful gates and let us through.
- Yes but, what good deeds have you done?
- Oh, dozens.
- Name one.
- Well I've...
- Mm hmm.
- I've...
What good deeds have you done?
- Well I...
- At least we haven't done any bad ones, honey.
- You know if we could do a good deed now, if we...
Ah George, you're fading.
- My trouble really began when I bought the Kerby car.
This was after it was fixed up of course.
My wife objected so there was only one thing to do and I did it, I ran away from home.
It was a big car and I wasn't used to driving such a powerful one.
Naturally, I was somewhat nervous.
- Would you mind getting off my wife's lap?
- Who said that?
- Ollie Ollie, oxen free!
- Stop it, my nerves are jumpy enough already.
Where are you?
- Would you get off my foot?
- Who are you, where are you?
I'm in no mood for this sort of thing.
Toppy doesn't know us
- Mrs. Kerby, may I present Mr. Topper?
- How do you do Mr. Topper?
- How do you do?
- And this is Mr. Kerby,
Mr. Topper.
- How do...
George and Marion Kerby, why, it can't be.
It mustn't be.
It is.
- Oh dear, Topper's fainted, get some water Marion.
- Water.
- Come on, Topper.
- Oh.
- Oh, that's fine you're a great help.
My hat.
- Oh no, no, no it can't be.
No, no, no, no.
If you don't mind I'm gonna get in my car and drive home.
- No, Topper.
- Sit down Topper, you can't get in your car and drive home because you got a flat tire.
Besides, it isn't your car, it's ours.
- Well, I'll walk you can have the car.
Mrs. Topper doesn't like the horrible thing anyway.
- Oh George, did you hear that?
- What?
- Mrs. Topper doesn't like the car.
Our good deed, let's get to work on him
- I'm afraid I don't understand it any more than you do.
She called me a good deed or something.
- Do you suppose his accident could've effected his mind?
- No dear, his past caught up with him.
- I request that the witness's testimony be stricken from the record on the grounds that it's incredible.
- I object, Your Honor.
My client has a right to his defense, regardless of its credibility.
- In my 32 years on the bench, I have never heard such a fantastic concoction of excuses, which the witness dares call a defense.
Court is adjourned until ten o'clock tomorrow morning.
- I'll be awfully lonely without you, George.
Gee, I wish you were here.
Same old oak tree, 'member?
But it doesn't seem quite the same without you.
What's the matter, Atlas?
Where are you?
Uh oh, come on up here.
That's a boy, don't be afraid, I won't hurt you.
I'm the same as you are,
I'm not here either.
You feel kind of lost, don't you pup?
I know how you feel 'cause I feel that way without George too.
Something made me come back.
Maybe it was a hunch.
I don't know what it was,
I think something must've gone wrong.
Maybe it was my good deed.
Don't be afraid, nothing can hurt you anymore.
I'll take care of you now.
- I better get this top up honey, you wait over there under that tree.
- I'll get my dress all wet, hurry up.
Oh honey, hurry up, I don't like it here.
- Won't take a minute.
- I don't know where you are, doggie but go away, shoo, go away.
- Give me that paper.
- Oh honey, honey!
Oh honey never mind the top, let's get out of here.
- Oh, Topper's too nice a fella to be in trouble.
I'm gonna get him out.
And you're gonna help me.
Come on, try hard.
Oh you can make it, it's a little hard at first but you'll get used to it.
That a boy.
- Alright boys, take it easy, take it easy.
I don't care who you are.
This divorce case is being tried privately and no visitors allowed!
So come on boys break it up.
- But I'm a friend of Judge Wilson's.
- That doesn't make any difference to me.
Nobody gets in here, so come on, get going.
Come on please, break it up.
- Proceed.
- And now Mrs. Topper, will you tell the court in your own words how
Mr. Topper abused you?
- Why he did no such thing!
Cosmo never said an unkind word to me in his whole life.
Look at him, poor lamb.
How could you say such unkind things about him?
- Your Honor I'm afraid my client is a little beside herself, nervous strain and all.
If you don't mind I'd like to excuse her and call Mrs. Parkhurst to the stand.
- Yes, excuse me Judge.
- You do solemnly swear that the testimony you may give in the court, now pending before this court shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?
- I certainly do.
- Now Mrs. Parkhurst you've been a friend to both parties in this case, have you not?
- I have been, yes.
- And is it your opinion that the defendant was ever cruel to his wife?
- He certainly was.
- Did he ever beat her?
- Of course.
- Now would you please tell the court in you own way Mrs. Parkhurst just how Mr. Topper humiliated Mrs. Topper?
- Well, he was sullen and moody.
He was discourteous and unfriendly.
And very often so insulting to Mrs. Topper and myself and her other friends, that we could hardly restrain ourselves.
Sometimes he would remain away from home on days on end.
With the flimsy excuse that he was fishing, or some such nonsense.
And with a bank full of money, he hardly ever gave her a cent.
It was a case of mental cruelty.
He seemed to resent Mrs.
Topper's social friends such as myself, and on several occasions when I endeavored to entertain
Mrs. Topper in her own home, he would embarrass her by refusing to be present at the party.
He even humiliated her by asking me to get out!
Sometimes he would remain away from home for days on end, with the flimsy excuse...
- You see Topper, I knew you needed me, so here I am.
- Well this isn't going to happen again.
It mustn't.
- And on several occasions when I endeavored to entertain
Mrs. Topper in her own home, he would embarrass her by refusing to be present.
- Oh Cosmo, darling.
Oh, oh Cosmo's fainted!
Somebody do something.
Oh, poor dear Cosmo, what happened?
- Marion, oh.
- Marion?
But I'm Clara, Cosmo.
- Order, order!
- Oh dear he's all mixed up again.
Oh Cosmo, please forgive me, it was all my fault.
I believe you.
- Will someone please inform this court exactly what I am supposed to be presiding over?
- Your Honor, this cheap trick is just another example of the way this man has trifled with the tender emotions of my client.
Over and over again, he's taken advantage of her trusting nature.
- Toppy, you get up and sock that guy in the chin.
- Hey, I couldn't do a thing like that here.
- Yes you can, get up.
- Stop, Marion.
I'm sorry Your Honor, sort of a nervous affliction.
Look out, you'll get hurt.
- I object.
- Order! Order!
- Sorry Your Honor, I can't help it.
- No judge would grant a decree in this case, decree denied.
- Wait, wait a minute, stop pushing me Marion.
- Oh dear.
Oh, now that I've got my divorce from poor Cosmo,
I feel so lonesome without him.
- But you didn't get your divorce, dear.
- Didn't I?
Then what was all this commotion about?
Oh, do I have to divorce him all over again?
- Of course Clara, but not here.
We'll go where your husband cannot interfere.
You and I are going to France.
I always get my divorces over there.
- Oh Toppy, don't act like a scared rabbit.
Stop running away from me.
- Can't you see I'm in trouble?
You've just got to leave me alone.
- I've got to see that you're happy.
- You can start making me happy by going away and never coming back.
- It isn't as easy as all that, come here.
Look Toppy, we're both in trouble.
And I'm not going to leave you until I see you safely back with Mrs. Topper.
- Your interference only makes matters worse.
Please go away, can't you see how upset I am?
- Oh I'll take care of that.
What we need is a drink, and this looks like the place.
- I don't want a drink, and I wouldn't go to a place like this, especially with you.
Stop it!
Marion, go away!
Don't, no, stop it!
Don't, Marion, no, no, stop it.
Stop it Marion!
Nice weather we're having for Thursday, isn't it?
Or do you like weather for Thursday?
What are you staring at?
- Would you mind going out there and coming in again the way you did?
- I'll do it on my way out.
- You with the circus or something?
- No, but I had an aunt with an elephant act once.
- Yeah, yeah, I know.
What'll it be?
- I don't think I care for anything, no.
- You don't you -
- Order a martini.
- A martini
- Martini.
- Make it two.
- Make it two.
- You mean a double martini?
- No I mean two, see, I like an extra olive.
I'm very fond of olives.
Marion for heaven sake, don't let him see you drinking that martini.
- Oh, I won't let him see me.
- Oh yes.
Will that be enough?
I can manage this alright, you run along and make some more.
- This drink's on me mister, will you do that again?
- Okay, you run along and make some more, will you?
I seem to be getting thirsty, mix a whole new batch of them.
- You alright Charlie?
- I guess I'm a bit nervous.
Would you mind if I use your telephone,
I'd like to call my house and find out where I am.
- Go right ahead.
Marion,
You've got to be more careful, you'll get me into trouble.
- Why be bald?
- Come away from that radio, people are gonna to think.
- You too can have a head of luxuriant hair.
Just drop a line or phone.
- Marion, stop it please.
I guess I got the wrong number.
- That ain't a telephone anyhow, it's a mysterious control box for the radio over there.
It's a new gadget just out, see.
You dial your extension here, and you hear it over there.
- Well where are the wires?
- There isn't any wires, that's the trick.
See, if you want it loud you dial loud.
That makes it loud.
And if you want it soft you dial soft, you got soft.
Anyhow, that telephone don't work.
That's just for the drunks if you want a phone, there's one over there.
- Here's how.
- Lady.
Where did you come from?
- She's been waiting for me for some time.
Only she just got here.
- Anyhow, I'm glad there's really two of you.
- Well Toppy, here's to you and my dog.
- Oh, don't tell me you brought that dog with you?
- Of course, Atlas is here.
Atlas, take a deep breath.
Try hard.
Come on, you can do it.
- What's that?
- There's a good dog.
- What is that?
Hey, how did he get in here?
We don't allow dogs!
- He's a very sensitive dog.
- Yes, you'll hurt his feelings
You hurry up and mix us some more drinks, will you?
- Yes, and fix an olive for the dog too.
Come on, Toppy, into a booth.
- Hey Charlie, Charlie are you there?
Listen Charlie you better mix them drinks,
I'm going out back and lay down.
- Whew, I'm hot, hasn't this place any ventilation or is that bad gin?
- For the last time, this is the last time, will you please go home?
- Just as soon as I get my house.
- Topper residence.
- Wilkins, this is Mr. Topper.
- I'm sorry sir, but
Mr.Topper isn't at home.
- He says Mr. Topper is not at home.
- Well isn't he?
- Are you sure Wilkins?
- I'm positive sir.
- Oh, well,
Do you know where he is?
- I haven't the slightest idea sir.
- Just tell him to call me if you find out where I am, hmm.
Thank you Wilkins.
He says he doesn't know where I am.
- Course not Toppy, 'cause you're here.
- Oh.
In that case I better tell Wilkins where I am so I can - in case I want to call him back.
- Haven't you got any home?
- That's just what I'm trying to find out.
Two more martinis.
- Two more,
- Two more.
- Then I'm gonna lock up.
- Then he's gonna lock up.
- Hello Wilkins, Mr. Topper.
- I've just informed you sir,
Mr. Topper is not at home!
- He still insists I'm not there.
He's always right, you know.
Good fellow, Wilkins, I don't know what he'd do without me.
Look here Wilkins, you tell Mr. Topper that I am not at home either, huh.
- Let me talk to him.
Hello, Wilkins, this is a friend of Mr. Topper's.
- Well if what you say is true madame,
Mr. Topper didn't waste much time.
- Mr. Topper wants to talk to Mrs. Topper.
- That won't be possible, madame.
Mrs. Topper sailed for France with Mrs. Parkhurst four hours ago.
- Ah ha, alright thank you.
Thank you for your trouble, Wilkins.
I always had my suspicions about that Mrs. Parkhurst.
Toppy, we got to go to Europe.
- Now listen to me, understand this clearly Marion.
There are some things you can make me do, but this time I'm gonna put my foot down.
I shall decide where I go.
- Alright, alright, have it your own way.
As long as it's Europe.
- Alright, as long as
I have it my own way.
- Come on, we've got to catch a boat.
- Well my passport's in the bank, and I can't get it 'til morning.
- Well you're president of the bank, aren't you?
Come on, let's get started.
- Yo mean we're both going to Europe?
- Sure Toppy, here's your hat, go on to Europe with the lady so I can get some sleep.
- Come on.
Hurry Toppy, can't you open it?
- Yes, it's as easy as one, two, three.
- Well then open it.
What's the combination?
- One, two, three.
- There it is.
- I had to have an easy number so I can remember it, in case I forgot.
Would you come inside, make yourself at home?
- Yes.
Atlas, you stay here and guard the door.
- What would I have filed my passport under, do you suppose?
- Why don't you look under T.
- T, what's that stand for?
- Topper.
- Oh, oh yes
Funny, he spells his name the same as mine.
Want to see my passport picture?
- No.
- Oh look,
T stands for toy dog too.
Woof, woof.
- What happened?
- When the door shuts the light goes out.
One, two, three got us in.
- Well that ought to be easy, three, two, one, ought to get us out.
- Give me that match.
Ouch, now I can't see where I burned myself.
- Steady men!
Give them the tear gas.
- I'm sorry I took so long, were you boys waiting to get in?
- Oh hello Eddie
- Hello, Mr. Topper.
Mr Topper
- Hello Doug
- Don't cry boys, I'm only going away for a little while.
I'll come back.
Get away Atlas, get away.
Stop pushing me, Marion.
- The Baron and I understand perfectly, but this Mrs. Topper, is she going to be difficult?
- Difficult, oh, why should she be?
Why I merely suggested coming here to France and she trailed right along.
- Tell me more about her, is she pretty?
- Well...
She has scads of money.
- She's pretty.
- Then I'll be very happy to entertain Mrs. Topper.
- And now Baron, if you invite me to the cocktail lounge
I'll buy you a drink.
- Oh, with pleasure.
- This is all very pleasant, but I'm still in a dither.
You know Nancy, I may have been too harsh with poor Cosmo.
- Clara dear, don't you think we might find a more pleasant subject to discuss than your husband?
- Yes Mrs. Topper,
Mrs. Parkhurst is right, you must relax, you're on a holiday.
You must forget about your unpleasant past.
And from now on
I'll see that you enjoy life as it should be lived,
- Oh Baron, what cute talk.
- Oh my dear, don't you feel the feel of the Mediterranean?
The beautiful water, the lovely sun.
Doesn't that do something to you?
- Yes, the heat makes my feet hurt.
- Oh Baron, Clara was only joking, weren't you dear?
- Was I?
Was I?
Oh, yes of course.
I think this is rather silly, don't you?
- Bad enough on the boat and on the plane, but this is going too far Marion, really.
On top of everything, you had to bring along a dog that isn't even here.
Okay, you just take that leash and whatever's on the end of it and leave me alone.
- Why Toppy, after all I've done for you too.
- I appreciate all you've done for me Marion, and I'd appreciate it even more if you never did it again.
- Get in,
Atlas, get in.
Get in, Atlas.
La Hotel San Pierre
- How much?
For Heaven's sake, stop all this nonsense and tell me what the fare is.
Stop making all this fuss and tell me how much I owe.
Does anyone around here speak English?
- I am the manager of this hotel, can I be of service?
- Just tell me what this idiot is yapping about, will you?
- He said that you have killed a woman.
- Is that any reason for making all this fuss?
I came here alone and here I am.
Doesn't that prove it?
- I'm sorry monsieur, are you insane?
- Be quiet, insulting a guest at the St. Pierre, here take this and go, and don't ever come back again!
- And let that be a lesson to you.
Come on let's go.
- Take the gentleman's luggage.
America, Bah!
- Bah yourself.
- I am so sorry monsieur,
I assure you it will never happen again.
It will be my pleasure to make your stay at our hotel a pleasure.
- Bonjour monsieur.
- I want some accommodation, please.
- I have a very lovely suite on the fourth floor.
- I'll take it.
- Yeah.
- I am very sorry Mr.
Topper, my clerk now finds that you have no reservation and our rooms are all taken.
- Can't you find anything for me?
- But monsieur, you would not like what we have.
We have one little room, but it would not suit a gentlemen like you.
Now I suggest...
- Yes, it's alright,
I'll take it.
- Monsieur
I know you will not like it won't you let me make arrangements for you some other place?
- I want to stay here.
You see I came to fetch my wife, Mrs. Topper.
She's registered here isn't she?
- Oh, oui.
- No, don't let her know I'm here,
I want to surprise her.
- Oh, that will be impossible,
Mrs. Topper is in Italy.
With Mrs. Parkhurst.
And the Baron Dupri
- Oh that's nice.
Now may I see my room?
- I know you will not like it monsieur.
- Please don't let's bicker anymore.
- The 14B.
- Why?
Why does the husband have to arrive at this time?
He'll spoil everything for the Baron.
I will get rid of him.
The, uh, uh...
Pig.
- Toppy you look like the Thinker without a thought.
You think of the tiniest things to worry about Toppy.
Well, we're gonna be nice and snug in this sweet little room, just the three of us.
- What do you mean the three of us?
- Well, what about me and Atlas?
- Oh no you can't do that to me again Marion.
After all the only reason
I'm over here at all is because you were found in my room once before.
- Topper you're getting crabby.
I know what's the matter with you, you're hungry and I'm gonna get you some food.
- Marion. put that phone down.
- Topper you need me, wouldn't you like to have some chicken and potatoes and soup and things?
- But monsieur I don't understand, do you always eat two dinners?
- Yes, always.
Of course I do, one on top of the other.
You see I eat the second one to keep myself company while I'm eating the first one.
I come here and I take a bite of something here, and then I come over here and then I take a bite here.
And then I go back there and so on.
And running back and forth gives me such an appetite that I naturally eat both dinners, you see.
- Hmm, naturally.
- But monsieur you dropped something.
- No, no, no don't touch it no.
I always keep a bone beside the bed so in case
I wake up in the night and feel like gnawing on something, you see.
Oh okay, you go away, will you go right away?
You're making me so nervous.
Get out of here will you, go on.
- Come on Toppy, I'm starved.
- Oh confound these people.
Come here, you've got to do something quickly.
- I'm getting pretty tired of this, come on Atlas.
Here we go again.
- Your champagne, monsieur.
- Come in.
- You wish two glasses monsieur?
- Yeah of course I do.
One for each hand.
Never mind, that will do, that'll be alright.
Yes that will be all, absolutely.
You've simply got to control yourself.
Or you're gonna get me into the same trouble again that I'm in already.
- Come on Toppy, have a drink.
- Alright but immediately after dinner you'll have to get out of here and take that confounding Atlas with you, yes I mean you.
- Atlas stop it, don't let Topper scare you.
What are you, a watch dog or a mouse?
Come on back.
Topper don't you see, we've got to stay here, there's no place else we can go!
- Alright, then I'll leave.
- Oh no you won't.
- Marion don't even as much as touch that phone.
- Hello.
- Now what have you done?
- Oh I just ordered another bed, and a large basket for the dog.
- A dog basket?
I'll suppose I'll have to tell them that I sleep in a dog basket.
- Unable to cable money.
Mrs. Topper lawyers have attached entire estate.
Am en route with baggage.
Wilkins.
Ah, excellent, he has no money.
Now I can get rid of him.
Voila.
- Oh Toppy, can't you cheer up?
You look like a dried up old apricot.
- Nothing could make me happy.
- Oh no?
Don't, Marion, no, don't!
No, stop it,
Marion stop it don't, stop it.
You hear something?
- Yes, someone's at the door.
- Why doesn't he come in?
That's more like it.
There's no one here.
- Monsieur, I shall have to ask you to open the door.
- Well go ahead, ask me.
- Well, open the door.
- Fine, okay.
- I see you have enjoyed yourself.
- Never had so much fun in all my life.
I wish you could've been here,
I'm glad you weren't, of course.
- You of course understand that it is expected that we be paid for this!
- If I'm not complaining, why should you?
Oh there they go again.
You know I haven't had a minutes peace since I've been here?
Might be quieter if I move into the lobby.
Bring it in, boys.
- What is this?
- Never mind.
Careful boys, don't knock the bottle over.
- Did you order this bed and this basket?
- Of course I did, I like two beds and a basket.
- Ah, he would like two beds and...
Monsieur, I will give you until tomorrow morning.
If you cannot pay for one week in advance,
I shall not only be forced to eject you, but I shall also be forced to throw you out!
- I see.
- I threw him out, tomorrow.
- Oh, this is dandy.
- Yes, now I will get thrown out.
I wish you could get me out of trouble just as easily as you can get me in.
- Toppy don't worry, they won't throw you out of any place.
Not with me along.
- I'd be in a fine fix if they did, wouldn't I?
I've nowhere to go, and I can't afford to go there anyhow.
- I know where we'll go, to the casino.
They have so much money there that they give it away, come on.
- Good evening.
Be quiet, Atlas.
Marion, where are you?
- Come on, get in the cab.
- But we have no driver.
- Get in the cab, Topper.
Let him figure it out for himself.
How much money have we?
- About 100 francs, how much is that?
- Not very much, but enough.
Come on, we'll plug it all on 13.
- No, Marion, I've never gambled in my life.
Except once when I won a turkey in a church raffle.
- Oh Toppy, you're not gambling, they're the ones.
You're a sure thing.
If we can't beat this game with our eyes shut we deserve to be broke, come on.
- No, I'd don't want to do it
- Uh oh.
Don't be so bashful, get in there.
- Beg your pardon, I'm so sorry.
- All bets down please.
27 the winner.
Pardon me, my mistake, the number is 13.
- But I thought you said 27?
- Sorry, I was hasty.
It was on the number 13, that is where the ball stopped.
Two.
Pardon me, the number is 13.
You win again, monsieur.
- Marion, this is dishonest.
- Would monsieur wish to examine the ball?
- Very pretty.
You win again monsieur.
- This is going too far, let me out.
- I beg your pardon?
Did you speak to me?
- Oh yes I did.
Just a minute ago, don't you remember?
I said, good evening.
- Yes, yes, good evening.
- Manager, manager.
- What is the trouble?
- I don't know, this man has won three times straight.
The ball keeps bouncing from one number to the other.
And always lands in 13.
- Three times?
- Three times.
- He cannot possibly win again on the same number.
- If he does he'll break this bank.
You just don't know what this ball has been doing!
- You spin it, I watch it.
He wins again.
- You tell Mr. Topper his time is up, don't mince words with him, either he pays you now one week in advance or out he goes.
- Ba.
- Now, voila.
Here he comes now.
Remember, do as I told you.
- Now look here young man, I don't like my room.
You see, I want a suite.
And I want it stocked with caviar.
And I want the bath tub stocked with champagne, all the bath tubs, and I want it now this very minute.
- Monsieur Topper, you will get anything you want, but we will have to eject you unless you pay one week in advance.
- One week, here's a month.
A year's worth.
And if I don't get better service
I'll buy the hotel and discharge everyone in it.
Starting with you.
- Oui, oui, Mr. Topper.
Excuse moi, pardon me one moment.
- Guess I told him, eh Marion?
Come on Marion, speak up, there's nothing to be afraid of.
Marion, where are you?
Marion, Marion!
Where have you been?
- Hello
- Will you please go away, I want to go to bed.
- Now that's gratitude for you.
I went to a lot of trouble to get you the best suite in this hotel!
- I thought they'd come around to my way of thinking.
- Well, follow me.
- Better get out of yourself, someone might see us.
- Don't worry.
Come on.
- I'm doing the best I can you don't have to push me, do you?
- I beg your pardon?
- Oh I'm so sorry, I must've been talking to myself, you see I thought I was someone I knew and I guess I wasn't.
Stop it, Marion.
- Wait 'til you see this, this is something like it.
Well, come in so I can close the door.
Just follow me, Toppy.
Oh, George would like this.
I wish he were here to help us, he'd know how to get us out of this mess.
- Now this is more like it, isn't it.
What? Oh.
Marion, make yourself visible so we can both enjoy it.
- Right oh Toppy, now then you stay here and I'll in the adjoining room with Mrs. Parkhurst.
- That's fine, oh, what did you say?
- I said you stay here in Mrs. Topper's room where you belong and I'll go in Mrs. Parkhurst's room.
- No, that's going a bit too far.
- Now Toppy, come back here,
I went through a lot of trouble to get the key to this suite.
- I know, but supposing Mrs. Topper came back and found us here?
- Will you stop worrying about
Mrs. Topper, she's in Italy.
- Oh alright, might as well get into trouble in this room as any other I suppose.
I'll do it but I won't like it.
- That's a good boy.
- Ah, home at last.
- I feel as if we've been away for several days.
- We have been away for several days.
- I guess that's the reason I feel that way, welcome home.
- Welcome back madame.
Did you have a nice trip?
- Oh, delightful.
- Rather early isn't it?
- Yes madame, it's just past dawn.
- Yes I know, we passed it as we drove in.
- I shall give you a chance to rest,
I shall call you this afternoon.
We are going bathing aren't we?
- Oh, yes of course.
- Goodbye Baron, it was a most enjoyable trip.
- A most enjoyable trip.
- Good bye my dears
Of course you are my dearer dear.
- Oh dear, oh dear
- See you later.
- I'll just never get used to having him kiss my hand, it makes me go all funny inside.
- Ah Mrs. Parkhurst, welcome home Mrs. Topper.
This is your home, it must always remain your home.
- Oh, thank you.
- Mrs. Topper you have an unwelcome visitor in your home.
Mr. Topper is here.
- My Cosmo!
Here?
- He is here but if you do not want him to stay, out he goes.
- Oh, but I do want him to stay.
- That's impossible Clara, you mustn't see him, it'll spoil everything.
- Oh, but I couldn't do that to poor Cosmo.
Why, just think he's come all the way across the ocean to see me.
Cosmo, my Cosmo.
- Then shall I tell him you are here?
- Oh, yes, yes, no, no, no not yet, I must have a facial and get my hair dressed, just think Cosmo is here.
Oh I wonder if I'll recognize him.
My Cosmo.
- Clara you're acting like a school girl.
- Do you really think so?
Why I've been out of school for years.
- Oh, help, help, help.
- Will you please stop yelling or people will think I'm murdering you.
- Oh, Cosmo!
- Oh hello Clara.
- Oh, Cosmo, how could you and in my own room?
- Clara, you couldn't think that I...
- You take my gown right off and get out of here, you, you, you bad man, you.
- Clara.
- You take my gown off right now, I never thought you could stoop so low, and I was almost so glad to see you.
- I can explain, I can explain.
- Oh Nancy, never in my life have I been so humiliated.
You have no idea how terrible it is to have faith in one.
To have that one prove faithless to one.
- Clara what's happened, what's wrong?
- Everything's wrong!
I just saw Cosmo making love,
Latin love to that maid, he's a beast, he was beating her, and tearing her clothes off.
Oh the pity of it.
- Clara, may I see you for a moment?
Alone.
- I don't want to see you ever again.
Please get out.
- But Clara.
- Really, Mr. Topper,
I think you could have put on some clothes before coming in here.
- Oh Mrs. Parkhurst, even if I liked you
I'd stop talking to you.
Please Clara, I want to explain.
- Explanations aren't necessary,
I just won't talk to you.
No matter what.
- But you must dear, I came all the way across the ocean.
- Did you have a pleasant trip?
- Well it was a bit rough.
Please Clara, won't you listen?
- She's listened to quite enough, would you leave?
- Please Clara.
- Oh, please get out, get out you nasty man.
Get out.
- I financed your trip to Italy.
I feed you, I clothed you, three years now, and you come back with no money.
- I didn't have a chance, the lady will not be hurried.
- You have the best prospect
America has sent us for years.
- You must have patience Louis.
I'm trying my very best, but you mustn't forget the lady is slightly eccentric.
- I give you one more chance.
- While you're here, we must be running over to St. Tropez.
You've never been there, no?
- Been there, I doubt if I can even say it.
You're so quaint, and so lovely.
But not so lovely as St. Tropez at the best time of the year.
It is the ideal heaven for those that wish to be alone, and who wish to enjoy the quiet evenings and the beach resting against the sand.
And the sand resting against the water.
- Isn't that exactly what happens here?
- Oh yes, but not like at St. Tropez.
- Boy, what a lot of people there are in France.
- Come on, sit down Toppy, you're a dear.
And I do hate to see you suffer.
- Oh, what's the use Marion?
Nothing can be done about it.
Mrs. Topper doesn't care for me anymore.
So I'm going back home.
- No you're not.
You can't do that.
I'll fix that sand lizard.
Watch me.
Zip.
- Gee, I wish I could do that.
- Oh!
My trunks!
Oh, my trunks.
- Your trunks?
What's the matter with them?
- Mrs. Topper.
- Well I fixed him good.
He won't chase you anymore.
- What did you do?
- I pulled his trunks off.
- His trunks?
Well Marion you mustn't forget he's with my wife.
- Don't worry, he won't be with her long.
Not when I get through with him.
- Madame I have a sense of humor, but this kind of a joke
I do not comprehend.
- But your majesty, I don't know anything about it.
- Mrs. Topper, haven't I always been a gentlemen?
- Yes, I think so.
- How am I doing?
- Oh, look out! Be careful!
- Hey!
- Why don't you get up and get out of the way?
- Please give me back my trunks.
Do something before I'm crushed to death!
- The children around here should be more careful with their toys.
I don't know why you keep on talking about your silly trunks!
- Hey, hey, get away, are you crazy?
- Oh, look out, be careful!
- Hey, you crazy dog.
Here it comes!
- Hey!
- Look out, be careful!
Look out!
Be careful!
- What can I do?
Get away, go away!
- Here comes the ball, be careful.
Come Baron, let's stop all this foolishness and get back to the hotel.
- But don't you understand?
I have lost my trunks!
- Well you can stay here if you want to, but I must be going.
I have an appointment with the beauty parlor.
I mustn't forget to call them and see if they can take me.
Too-da-loo.
- Oh please, madame, madame.
Do something, the tide is coming in and I'm going to drown!
- Oh don't be silly
Baron, it's only water.
- Hello.
- Oh, hello.
- May I sit down?
- Please do.
- It's a lovely day to be lying in the sand, isn't it?
- Yes.
- You know, when I was a little girl I just loved to lie in the sand all covered up like you are.
- When I was a little boy I didn't mind.
But now it's most uncomfortable.
- Oh.
- Is this your little dog?
- Yes.
- Cute little thing isn't he?
You're an American.
- Yes, uh
Daddy's in the steel business.
- Would you do me a favor?
- Favor, yes.
- Oh, I've had a terrific accident.
- Oh, isn't that too bad.
- I need a pair of trunks in the worst way.
Size 32.
- Trunks, size 32, size 32, well I'll see what I can do.
Now you won't go away, will you?
- Oh no, mademoiselle.
- Mr. Topper, this is preposterous if I may say so.
And good afternoon sir.
- Hello Wilkins, what's preposterous?
- Well a gentlemen of your position, sir, in a room of this dimension.
I should complain to the manager.
- You don't understand
Wilkins, I like this room, it's exactly the kind of room I want.
It's nice and cozy and everything is just where I can reach it, and people dropping in all the time.
Oh, glad you brought my dog.
- But surely you would be more comfortable sir if they took out that extra bed.
- No, no, no, I want that bed, you see,
I like to have a spare bed, then if I walk over there in my sleep and lie down, I'm still in bed.
- It does seem a little odd, sir.
Of course, you go just as you wish.
And Mrs. Topper, have you seen her?
- Well yes, well, that is she is staying here in the same hotel.
- Oh, I think I understand, sir.
- Do you, Wilkins?
- Quite, sir.
And how is Mrs. Topper?
- I don't really know, she won't talk to me.
She refuses to talk to me.
- Oh, I'm very sorry sir.
Would you mind very much if I called on Mrs. Topper?
Just to pay my respects, sir.
- Not at all.
- Oh thanks, I'll call on her right away.
Mrs. Topper.
- That phone, that doesn't work Wilkins.
Mrs. Topper's suite is number 47 at the end of the balcony that way.
Marion, you should be ashamed of yourself smoking in front of Wilkins.
- Well anyway, I fixed it so that that Baron won't bother you anymore.
- You can fix it so you won't bother me anymore.
- Why Toppy, if I weren't here to bother you, who'd you get?
- Wilkins brought my dog.
- What is the matter with the service in this hotel?
I ordered two martinis 15 minutes ago.
What?
Well the boy must be lost, come in.
No nevermind, no here he is now.
- I beg your pardon.
- Oh, do come in.
- I beg your pardon madame, but I was expecting to find Mrs. Topper here.
My name is Wilkins.
- So you're a friend of Mrs. Topper's?
- Well I've known Mrs. Topper for several years. madame.
- How do you do, Mr. Wilkins?
Won't you sit down,
Mrs. Topper's dressing.
Come in.
Oh, do sit down.
- Thank you.
- Ah finally, will you join me?
Mrs. Topper will be hours dressing.
- I don't think I'd better, madam.
I've never taken a drink before in my life.
- Oh, now don't tell me you've gone through life without having one little drink?
- I assure you that I've never taken a drink.
- Oh, you're joking.
- No, I'm not really.
- Well, down the hatch.
- I beg your pardon?
- Down the hatch.
- Right, good.
- I know that I've seen you somewhere before.
Are you a foreigner?
- Well that depends entirely upon what country one is in when the question is asked, ma'am.
- You aun-Americans are so quaint.
That's what Clara always says about the Baron.
- The Baron?
- Yes, the Baron is planning on being the future Mr. Topper.
And modestly speaking, I have arranged the whole thing.
Oh, Mrs. Topper's so thrilled.
Didn't you say that we had met before?
- I didn't say so madame, no.
But we have.
- Oh I knew it, my memory is so poor, won't you refresh it?
- It was when I opened the door for you at Mrs. Topper's, ma'am.
- You opened the door for me at Mrs. Topper's?
But surely I would remember that.
- There's nothing unusual about a butler opening a door.
- What?
- A butler.
- Butler?
- Would you tell Mrs. Topper that I called, madame?
- Oh, oh.
Oh.
Good day.
- Thank you for your trouble.
- Well what are you waiting for?
- Well, I was just thinking what a strange world we live in.
Now you're opening the door for me.
- Now then Toppy, aren't you glad you came to my party?
- I always enjoy being with you when you behave yourself.
But I don't know which is making me dizzier, you or the wine.
- You just say that because you're enjoying yourself.
This is fun!
- I have reserved a lovely table for you.
- Isn't that a cute way to talk?
Too bad the people in
America aren't French.
- You don't mind if I close my eyes, do you?
I always close my eyes when
I'm enjoying myself most, to make it last longer.
- Uh oh.
- There's your husband acting a fool.
- Cosmo, I can't understand what's happened with him lately.
- Getting better, aren't I Marion?
Oh, oh.
Oh, well well, Clara.
Marion, I don't know why I don't take you over my knees and spank you.
- Well if you are so brave,
I don't see why you don't go over there and punch that, that Baron in the nose.
- I can't understand what's happened to Cosmo.
He used to be so sedate and gentlemanly.
- Clara, will you please be sensible.
Don't you see the man is crazy?
- I can punch anybody in the nose if I feel like it.
And I feel like it.
- Good boy Toppy, I'm right behind you.
- Alright.
- Clara, what a beautiful name.
- Listen to me, you are to stop running around after my wife and get out of here or I'm going to punch you in the nose!
- Cosmo, stop it!
- I'm insulted my seconds will wear upon you tomorrow morning.
- No, if we're going to fight, we're going to fight now.
I might not feel like fighting tomorrow morning.
Cosmo.
- Ladies, he leaves me no alternative.
- What the...
Why, who's holding me there?
- Stop it.
- Go on darling, give it to him.
He's awfully heavy Toppy, but I'll get him off you
- You're going out the door!
- I will send your baggage wherever you wish, but you will never enter this hotel again!
- Oh ho, he's asking for it.
Watch this.
- You, I will call the Gendarme!
- Go ahead and call the
Gendarme, you crackerhead!
- I have nothing to do with it!
See, I have my hands in my pocket.
- Never in my life have
I been so astonished.
Just think, Cosmo a pugilist, and so successful too.
Why, he was practically a cave man.
- Clara, I really believe that you're glad that he pummeled the Baron.
- Oh poor Baron, he must be suffering.
Do you think I should go to him and offer him my sympathy?
- Yes, of course my dear, and be sure and explain that you are not responsible for your husband's actions.
- I'm not?
- No, dear, now go ahead and tell him how sorry you are.
- Oh of course I'm sorry, but Cosmo looked so cute pummeling the Baron.
- Come in.
Oh, so it's you.
- Yes it's me.
- Come right in.
- Oh, thank you.
Oh Baron, I want you to know how terribly I feel about Cosmo beating you up the way he did.
Oh... but I still can't understand how such a little shrimp could get the best of me.
Cosmo's no shrimp!
Oh, forgive me
I came to sympathize with you and here I am defending Cosmo oh... terrible scar
- Oh, there you are darling.
- Oh!
- Am I interrupting something?
- Are we in the wrong room?
- What does this mean?
- Yes, what does this mean?
- Who is this woman?
Why am I here?
- She's a very wealthy girl, and lonesome.
But I can explain everything.
- Oh then go ahead.
- Oh, that's all.
- Darling, don't tell me this is another of your flirtations?
- Flirtations?
- Yes, he's so impetuous, sometimes he forgets he has a home.
- A home?
- I find it very difficult to forgive him, but he's all I have.
- Oh, you little shrimp you, if I had believed you
I'd be broken hearted now.
- But Mrs. Topper.
And now my -
Where are you?
- What is the matter with the service in this hotel?
I ordered a bottle of champagne half an hour ago.
What?
Well it isn't here yet.
Come in.
Nevermind, here he is now.
Come in.
You get out.
- I'm sorry madame, but I've got to see Mrs. Topper at once.
It's very urgent.
- well in the first place
Mrs. Topper is not here, and in the second place if she were here, she would not be for you.
I don't want to find you here when I come back.
Clara, what happened, what has that unspeakable husband of yours been up to now?
- It's not Mr. Topper this time, it's that awful Baron.
- The Baron?
- Yes, the Baron.
All the time he's been trying to play court to me he's been married, and frankly I don't think he's even a Baron, not that I care.
But I saw her with my own eyes wearing his pajamas.
- Well she might've been his sister?
- I've not met the Baron, but I think I'm safe in saying that she is not his sister.
- I thought I told you to leave?
- Oh Wilkins this is a surprise.
- Thank you very much, madame.
May I have a word with you in private please?
- Oh, of course Wilkins.
- Under the present circumstances
Mrs. Topper couldn't possibly be interested in anything that you have to say to her.
- Oh yes I could, come on
Wilkins we'll speak privately.
I'm sure Mrs. Parkhurst won't mind.
- Mr. Topper's in jail, madame.
- In jail, what for?
- Disturbing the peace, malicious destruction and common drunkenness, madame.
- And they've put him in jail for that?
Well we must do something about it.
- That's what I had in mind madame,
I thought if you could advance me a little money.
I would be able to make the necessary arrangements.
- Oh of course, Wilkins.
- Clara, you don't know what you're doing.
- I know I don't, but Wilkins does.
- Hello Toppy!
Guess who's on the under end of this key?
What a jail.
This is like opening a box of candy.
Marion, you can't come rushing into somebody's cell like that, you'll ruin the reputation of the whole jail.
- Come on Toppy, fix yourself up, we're going to have a jail break.
- Oh no, I don't want to go away from here,
I'm just beginning to feel at home.
- Now Toppy you're not going to stand in my way.
I've got Mrs. Topper all fixed up.
You're not going to ruin my good deed, you're going back to her.
- I'm not entirely sure
I want to go back to her.
Let her come to me.
I'll be right here.
- Oh Toppy, you don't mean that.
You know what we'll do?
I'll open the back door and you sneak out in the alley while I take care of the guards.
- Marion, we can't do that, that's breaking jail.
They lock you up for that.
- Come on, we have to hurry, now while I'm taking care of things you sneak out.
Marion, you locked me out.
- Everybody out, everybody out, come on, everybody out.
- Marion don't do that, don't open all those cells.
Get out Atlas!
Get away from here!
Go on home, leave me alone.
- Hey Topper, wait for me!
Yoo hoo, Toppy, see you later boys.
Yoo hoo, Toppy.
- Get out.
Stop!
Go away!
- Hey Topper, wait for me!
- Oh!
- Excuse me!
I'm sorry, so sorry.
Oh, oh!
- Get out of the way,
I can't stop!
- Now at last we can resume our little argument that you started and I'll finish.
- I love arguments.
Sic him, Atlas.
- This is no time to be cute, which way did Mr. Topper go?
- Well he went down the hall.
- Cosmo!
Oh, I'm so happy, I knew you'd come back to me.
Now everything's going to be alright again isn't it?
I'm so sorry that I've been so silly.
- Clara dear, you don't understand.
You see, I'm in a sort of hurry.
All of France is after me.
- Cosmo, look at your trousers!
Oh, there's been a moth or something chewing them.
Sit right down here and I'll fix them.
You do have a needle and thread?
- Clara, I can't possibly stop.
I've got to get away, they're coming after me now.
- Your friends will just have to wait,
I can't have you running around looking like this.
Sit still, darling.
- Clara, they're right at the door.
- Well, tell them you're not here.
If you people have any complaint to make, go and see the manager.
- Open the door.
- Hello, hello operator, operator will you please tell the porter to get me two full fare tickets on the first plane leaving France?
- Don't forget Wilkins.
- And don't forget Wilkins, please hurry, my husband's a fugitive you know, and we have to escape.
Come on, darling.
Oh darling, now that we're so happy, don't look so sad.
Oh, come along.
- George, hey George!
Look at them, I had a tough time getting them together, but I did it, all by myself too.
Aren't you happy?
Now I get to come back to you.
Hey!
Wait a minute!
- I'm so happy.
Aren't we, Darling?
- Yes.
- Bless our happy home.

THE GHOST GOES WEST
Based on a novel by Eric Keown
CAST
18th Century Scotland
- What are we waiting for? - We're not to be denied by the Glouries!
If they refuse to open, we'll break down the door!
Wist, lads!
I tell you again, we will see the accursed Glourie.
And if you don't open the door, we'll break it down.
Aye? Aye? But you daren't disturb the Glourie!
Here, your medicine, Glourie.
The physician said...
Never mind what the physician said!
My medicine has always been whisky.
But I tell youGlourie, he said that it would kill you!
I will not die.
I will not die until I seen my son go to the war!
- What was that?
- The MacLaggan!
Here's the Glourie!
And what business have men of clan MacLaggan with me this day?
Give me my bonnet.
Gavin Glourie, we come to tell you that me and my five sons and all the men of clan MacLaggan, are marching to fight the English for the glory of Scotland. and we rejoice that in the battle there will not be one fighting man that bears the hated name of Glourie.
I am too old and too ill to fight this day, but if, by accident, any of you MacLaggan should happen to stray near the front line of battle, you will see there my son Murdoch!
Your son Murdoch, eh?
Ay!
We saw him just now in a field playing with women. Young women!
A better occupation for a Glourie than war!
Fetch me my son!
He will repay you for this insult!
He'll have his chance on the battlefield, but let me tell you, for the last time, that the Glourie are a clan of craven cowards, and we MacLaggans, being men, despise you!
Men? I tell you, one Glourie is man enough to thrash
50 MacLaggans!
- That's an insult, Father!
We'll revenge it! - No!
It's a waste of strength to bicker with the last poor feeble relics of the clan Glourie!
- Come on, lads.
- Get out, before my son comes and slays you all!
Give me that...
Bring me another glass.
- Whose turn is it now?
- Mine!
- Later.
- Mine! - No!
- Mine.
- No, no, it's Jean's.
What's the difference betwixt a thistle in the heather and a kiss in the dark?
If you can't tell me by the time
I've spelt "Killiecrankie", you must pay the forfeit.
K-I-L-L-I-E...
- I give it up.
- Wait now, C-R-A-N-K-I-E.
Well, you pay the forfeit.
- What is it?
- You know very well it's a kiss, it's always a kiss, come here.
- Murdoch!
- What is it?
Forgive me, but your father is wanting you.
What for?
I think he's wanting you to be going to the battle.
Oh, aye, the battle.
But first I must claim the forfeit!
Murdoch!
Fare thee well, lasses!
I'll be back soon!
Murdoch!
When you meet any of the clan
MacLaggan on the battlefield, strike him down!
But I thought I was supposed to fight the English?
You're a Glourie.
You fight the MacLaggans first!
You can attend to the English later.
- Goodbye, my son.
- Goodbye, Father.
Remember! You must not pause for one moment until you've avenged that insult!
- Now Glourie, you must rest.
- I'll rest...
My son's a man at last!
I can die content.
...When I finish this whisky.
Glourie, Glourie!
- What's happened?
- He's ill.
- Aye, very ill.
- But we'll send for the physician!
No, it's too late now.
May Heaven receive the soul of Gavin Glourie.
Good morning, my bonny lass!
- Remember Murdoch, your father said you mustn't pause.. - Be quiet.
Tell me lassie, which is the way to the battle?
The second turning to your left, and then bear right until you come to men fighting. And that'll be it.
Well if the battle doesn't start on time, I'll be back. Wait for me.
That cannon looks as though it's seen great service!
Hey, it's been fighting for
Scotland for over a hundred years.
But how many cannons have the English?
A dozen or more, but they're all brand new.
No match for Old Terrible here.
Wait till you hear him!
I'll be glad to, but first
I've an account to settle with the accursed MacLaggans!
But what do you want with them?
They've insulted the name of
Glourie, which I'm proud to bear.
- Are you one of the MacLaggan?
- Me? No, no, I hate them too!
- Have you aimed Old Terrible?
- Ay, sir!
He's all ready to blow the English off the face of the earth!
- Then fire!
- Come, alack!
Come back! Alack!
Come on! Fire!
I think you've made a slight mistake in your aim.
You addle-pated fools!
You've wasted a good cannonball!
Never mind! I saw where it fell.
I'll bring it back to you.
Come on, lads.
The battle's started!
Forward till we meet the Redcoats, and then we'll chase them out of Scotland!
Forward!
- MacLaggan? - Don't interrupt us, we're advancing.
But Murdoch Glourie is looking for you.
A Glourie?
Here on the battlefield?
Where is he?
- At the cannon.
- You lads go and find him!
- But the battle!
First we must settle this important matter!
About turn!
March!
It must have rolled in there.
I'll leap over.
Here, hold my claymore and tarts.
Why my dear young lady, what's the matter?
This horrible battle.
Oh, it can't be as bad as all that.
My lover is there fighting and he'll be killed.
You mustn't think of him.
He's a hero.
We're all heroes.
There, there...
You're a kind good man and
I thank you for comforting me.
It's a pleasure, my dear.
Tell me, do you know the game of Spell Me a Riddle?
You see I tell you a riddle, and if you can't tell me the answer by...
Murdoch!
Remember, your father said that you mustn't pause.
Away with you!
I'll be out in a moment.
- There's the Glourie!
- That's his groom.
- He'll know where Murdoch is.
- Let's ask him.
- I give up.
- Well you must pay the forfeit.
- What is it?
- It's this.
Murdoch!
There's always some cursed interruption!
Oh, I see! Forgive me lassie,
I'll be back soon!
- Murdoch!
- Here, stop!
- There he is!
- Look at him!
- Bold Glourie, the fighting man!
- With a woman, as usual!
- My cannon will stop your laughing!
- Come and get it yourself.
We'll return it, through your body!
- Hand it over!
- You've met your match, Glourie!
- Come on!
- Get that cannon, Glourie!
We'll get it!
Just a minute, just a minute!
I have to have a sword!
Will someone lend me a sword?
GUN POWDER
Shoot!
May Heaven receive the soul of Murdoch Glourie.
Murdoch, my son, can you hear me?
Father, where are you?
Where am I?
In limbo,
the empty place between
Heaven and Hell.
I died with honor, and you died a coward's death.
Do you realize that?
Yes Father, I suppose I did.
Then you can never be welcomed among your ancestors in Heaven.
Never?
You will be an earth-bound ghost,
doomed to haunt the dark halls of Glourie Castle...
The Lord preserve us!
It's a ghost!
It's come back!
It's the ghost!
It's the ghost!
Father?
Yes, my son?
How long do I have to go on with this nonsense?
I mean, frightening people like that.
You promised to avenge our honor and you failed.
You will remain the phantom in this castle
until that promise is fulfilled.
When you twist the nose of one of our enemies,
and make him kneel before you, and admit that one Glourie
can thrash 50 MacLaggans.
But suppose I can never find a MacLaggan?
A promise is a promise.
Every night at midnight,
you will awaken and walk through the halls of this castle,
until you've found a MacLaggan
and forced him to bow down before you in humble apology.
Then and not till then,
will you be permitted to ascend from limbo
and join your noble ancestors in Heaven.
Farewell,
Miserable ghost of a Glourie.
20th Century
FOR SALE
GLOURIE CASTLE
INQUIRE WITHIN
- Hey!
- What?
Excuse me, but I'm looking for the owner of this place.
Aye. So am I.
He's hiding somewhere around this castle, and I propose to find him!
Well you'll not find him here, so I would thank you to take your sour faces out of my kitchen!
Donald Glourie owes me about 150 pounds for ales, wines and liquors furnished during the past seven years.
And he owes me upwards of
200 pounds for provisions.
And what about my loan?
Aye, aye. We know how much he owes you skinflints, and you know how much chance you have of being paid before the day this castle's sold.
- And when will that day come?
- I just could not say.
I will not wait for it.
We'll get the bailiff and take possession ourselves.
Possess away then, but get out of my sight, the lot of you!
What's more, there's someone else in the house after him!
- Who? - I don't know.
- Where?
- In the hall.
- Oh, I...well...
They'll not be there long!
How did you come here?
I just walked in that front door.
It was open.
That's no reason. The lock of that door's been broken for 200 years.
What do you want?
I saw a sign that this place was for sale.
That's still no reason.
You know the price?
You'll not be thinking of buying it, are you?
Master Donald!
- Master Donald!
- What is it?
It might be a purchaser.
- Do you think he's serious?
- It's a she, and young too.
But she's got a queer kind of speech.
I'll try to understand her.
The debts of Donald Glourie come to a grand total of 2374 pounds, 18 shillings and 4 pence half pence.
And he hasn't even the half pence to pay us!
Do you think he'll ever sell this old ruin?
Not while the Glourie ghost walks these halls.
'Tis the curse that's been on his family for 10 generations!
Ghosts or no ghosts, debts are debts and must be paid.
Come on, we'll search the castle till we find the renegade.
And when you find him, don't let him out of your sight!
This is Mr. Glourie, Miss.
How do you do?
My name is Peggy Martin.
- Oh...mine's Donald.
I hear you're interested in selling this castle.
Why yes, I might be interested.
Will you sit down?
No, I think I'll just stand.
I'd like to walk around a bit.
I'm kind of nervous.
That's funny, so am I.
Oh, that's too bad.
It doesn't really matter.
I break something every day just for the pleasure of putting it together again.
Are you an American?
- Yes, how'd you guess it?
Why do you keep staring at me like that?
Have you never seen an American before?
Oh yes, several.
Where, in the zoo?
Please forgive me, it's just that...well...
We don't often get anything worth staring at in this...
Mr. Glourie, there is a financial matter to discuss.
Oh yes, of course. Do sit down.
I'm not at all sure I do want to sell this castle, but I'll be glad to show you around.
Of course, some of the panelling's falling to pieces because it needs to be repaired.
I love it!
You've no idea what it means to us to see something that isn't new.
Here is the room that
Mary, Queen of Scots slept in.
Hey!
He's in that room!
How do you do?
It probably sounds silly to you, but I guess every American has a hankering for this kind of... romance, beauty, and peacefulness.
Who are all those cheerful-looking men?
Oh them.
They're just businessmen.
Do they want to buy the castle?
Yes, they're very keen to get possession of it.
- I think it's lovely.
- Yes, lovely.
I'm sure you'd hate to part with it.
I'd hate to let any of them have it.
We haven't said anything about the price!
Oh no, there's no need to mention that.
I'll leave that to my father.
Would it be all right if
I brought him here?
And my mother too?
- Of course.
But perhaps they'd...
Perhaps you'd bring them for dinner here this evening.
Have you any other relatives?
- No.
I mean no husbands or anything like that?
Not even one.
What time shall we be here?
- As early as possible. I mean...
And if for any reason your parents can't come, come anyway, won't you?
Oh don't worry,
I'll have them here.
Goodbye, Mr. Glourie!
- Goodbye, Miss...Miss...!
And who's to furnish this fine dinner?
And the champagne?
And who's to serve it?
You'll furnish the meat, Mr. Ross.
I think we'll have grouse.
And the champagne from you,
Mr. MacKaye, and Mr. Crawford we'll have some of your best salmon.
And all of you will help to serve it!
- What?
- The insolence of a woman!
We'll see you in jail first, and him too.
Come into the kitchen and we'll all have a glass of whisky and talk it over.
We will not!
We're self-respecting tradesmen and we'll not.
You had the talk just now, didn't you?
Aye, we did, but...
"Aye, but"!
The lass is an American, and all
Americans are filthy with money.
- Is that not so? - I've heard of some that used to be.
That whisky was furnished by me and I'm still owed for it.
Come, come now, Mr. MacKaye.
Even if it isn't paid for, it's still whisky.
I know Master Donald owes you all, especially you, Mr. Ross, you flint-hearted moneylender, but the only chance you have of being paid is for him to sell the castle to these Americans.
What about the Glourie Ghost?
At midnight he'll be appearing.
And there'll be no sale.
- They'll see no ghost.
We'll give them a good dinner and long before midnight they'll have agreed to buy the castle and we'll be rid of them.
Maybe.
Come on my lads, we must give this matter some thought.
Good gracious! Have you not finished that yet?
It'll never be ready tonight!
Will you stop that hideous noise while I'm cooking?
We're needing practice.
Well off you go to the piggery.
It'll sound more natural there.
What are you waiting for?
I must say you look a rich man in your fine clothes.
Thank you, Fergus.
I can assure you that the tailor who made this dinner jacket also hopes the castle will be sold.
Don't forget that you borrowed that shirt stud from me.
It's an heirloom in my family, and everyone admits it's solid gold.
It must be returned.
It will be returned, in good condition.
- Is everything ready?
- Everything but your guests.
They're late.
And I warn you,
I'll not be here at midnight to see the horrible specter that frightened my grandmother out of her wits!
I'll keep my eye on that clock.
You know I'm in the retail grocery business, chain stores all over the United States.
Over 20 millon customers!
Quite a responsibility knowing that every day you have
20 millon stomachs to fill.
- Oh, yes!
- He's drunk the whole bottle.
- Open another.
- Remember it's 22 and 6 a bottle!
And remember also that's my stud!
This place seems very antique.
It's 600 years old, Mother.
I knew I could feel a sense of the past here.
Is it by any chance haunted?
Mother's scared to death of ghosts, but I'm not, I'd love to meet one.
Well I've no desire for dealings with the other world.
Is there a ghost, Mr. Glourie?
Well, I suppose there are legends about every old place.
I'll answer your question, Gladys.
There isn't any ghost here or anywhere else because ghosts simply don't exist outside of mystery stories.
If you don't mind, I'll have some more of that duck.
- Duck? That's grouse.
- What's the difference?
11 shillings and 8 pence.
Thank you.
Ever since I had my nervous breakdown,
I have been extremely psychic.
And if there were a ghost here,
I should see him and hear him.
What's that?
What is it?
It's only the bagpipes Mr. Martin, an old Scottish custom during dinner.
An old Scots custom, eh?
Sounds great.
I'll have some more champagne, please.
Some more champagne.
8 pounds, 3 shillings and a penny.
Gather up the rest of the whisky,
Mr. MacKaye. I'll take the cigars.
They must be away.
- First I must get back my stud!
There's little time left.
I've heard it right here by this table.
The monster comes into view each night.
It certainly is old, but aren't you ever afraid that it might fall to pieces?
- It does need a little reconstruction here and there... - Yeah.
- What time is it?
- It's early, Mother.
We ought to get home before midnight.
It's what they call
"the witching hour" for departed spirits.
If you don't stop talking about ghosts, you'll be dreaming about them all night.
Maybe I'm dreaming.
I'd have sworn there was a decanter of whisky on that table a moment ago.
Some whisky for Mr. Martin.
- We're going now, Mr. Glourie.
- Why?
We have no wish to be here when the ghost comes.
My butler tells me there's a bad storm coming up.
I think it would be safer if you started before it breaks.
You see these Highland roads are treacherous and...
But we can wait a few more minutes.
It's almost midnight!
Midnight?
We better leave at once!
- There she goes again!
- Tell her, Mr. Glourie.
Tell her there's nothing like that around here. Unfortunately!
Oh...yes.
Fergus!
Have you ever seen a ghost in Glourie Castle?
Never have I seen one.
And never do I intend to!
I think we better move into another room. It's getting cold in here.
Oh, yes.
I think it would be better.
- Just a minute, Mother.
I counted only 11 strokes.
- But the clock says 12.
I hope I haven't broken anything very valuable.
Sorry, I bumped into one of your ancestors.
It's all right, can I help you?
Are you hurt?
I'm all right, but I suggest that you get a little reconstruction here and there on that chair!
It's quite all right, Mr. Martin.
You see? It's after midnight and nothing happened!
- I'm sort of disappointed.
- The only thing that's happened is somebody sneaked away with the whisky again!
Come on Gladys, we'll take you home.
Goodnight, Mr. Glourie.
Thank you for a nice quiet evening.
Maybe tomorrow we can get together and talk a little business.
Goodnight.
You want to go first, Peggy?
No, you go ahead, Dad.
I'll follow you.
Goodnight, Mr. Glourie.
You've been very kind.
- You will come back, won't you?
- Oh I'll come back, you may be sure.
- Goodnight.
Murdoch Glourie... for the first time in history you've been considerate.
You've done me a good turn, and for that I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
Don't thank him, Master Donald.
Thank me.
- You?
- When you were at dinner,
I set it ahead an hour.
That's the right time now.
It's all right, Murdoch. Come forth whenever you please.
Hello! Is anybody awake?
- Who is it?
- That American, Peggy.
I'm terribly sorry to disturb you like this...
Have you forgotten something?
No. I just wanted to tell you about your clock downstairs. It's fast!
- Is it?
- One hour.
But that's not the real reason
I came, Donald.
You don't mind my calling you Donald, do you?
Oh no Peggy, I don't mind.
Well...
The fact is you never really get to know a place until after you've stayed in it a bit.
So would it upset you awfully if
I were to spend the night here?
Oh no, of course not!
But...
- Any old bedroom will do.
But they're all so terribly uncomfortable.
I don't mind.
- And so cold. - But we can light a fire, can't we?
It's not easy to sleep in this castle. You may hear noises.
- What kind of noises? - Sometimes they might be like footsteps.
Sometimes like moans.
- It sounds sort of scary.
Oh, no, no.
It'll just be the wind whistling through the cracks in the walls and rattling the old boards.
Tell me, Mrs. MacNiff...
Is there anything to all this talk about a ghost?
I tell you, Miss:
Whatever you hear, it's only the wind.
Murdoch!
Murdoch Glourie!
I want to ask you a favor.
Be quiet, just this one night.
Come in.
Who is there?
Why, it's Mr. Glourie!
- It is.
Oh, you scared me!
For a moment I thought you were a ghost.
I am a ghost.
I am the famous Glourie ghost, that haunts this castle through the darkness at night searching, searching for a despised MacLaggan.
So that's the explanation!
And I always thought you Scotch people had no sense of humor.
- So you don't believe me?
- Of course I do.
And I think you look marvelous in that fancy dress costume.
It's just what I happened to be wearing on the day of my death and my disgrace.
Your death?
And when did that happen?
I forget the exact day, but...
It must have been about
200 years ago.
200 years?
You look so young.
Don't you know that we never age?
Or aren't you used to us?
No, this is my first encounter.
And I'm surprised that I'm not terrified of you...Donald.
Why do you call me Donald when my name is Murdoch?
Because I'm no more frightened of
Murdoch than I would be of Donald.
I'm glad of that.
I should hate to alarm such a pretty young girl.
And you're the first I've met since the day of that ill-fated battle.
It was a shepherdess then.
I believe.
I'd just started teaching her a game, and she was enjoying it very very much.
- And what sort of a game was it?
- Spell Me a Riddle.
Do you know it?
- No. How is it played?
Well you see, I ask you a riddle.
And if you can't answer by the time I spell "Killiecrankie", you must pay a forfeit.
Now this is the riddle:
What is the difference betwixt a thistle in the heather and a kiss in the dark?
Now you must answer.
K-l-L-L l-E-C-R-A-N
K-l-E.
- I give up.
You must pay the forfeit with a kiss.
No, but first you must tell me!
What is the difference between a thistle and a kiss?
- The forfeit comes first.
- Oh no it doesn't!
- I tell you it does!
- And I tell you goodnight.
Murdoch, my son!
I know, Father.
I must never again let a pretty face divert me from my true purpose.
But it's been such a long long time since I saw one as nice as that...
Everything's all right.
The American came back.
He's in there with Master
Donald now. Fergus is with them.
- Good morning, Donald.
- Hello.
- Is my father still there?
- Yes. You want to see him?
Wait.
I'd like to have a few words with you first.
I like people who do crazy things.
- Crazy things?
Like dressing up and pretending to be a ghost.
You know, you had me almost scared for a minute last night.
Oh, had I?
And when I saw you in that magnificent costume, with the tartan over your shoulder and a big silver buckle...
A silver buckle?
Oh yes, you thought he looked...
I looked well in that?
Oh, much more handsome than you do now.
And gayer, too.
Are you going to tell me the answer?
- To what?
- The riddle you asked me, about the kiss and the thistle?
Oh, no, no, I can't tell you now.
I guess I'll never know the answer until I pay the forfeit.
Well...Here it is!
And now what's the answer?
Oh no, you can't have the answer yet.
But I paid for it!
Do you think one kiss is enough for the secret mysteries of Glourie Castle?
Oh no. That's only the beginning of the thought.
But what else must I do?
Well you'll find out later, Peggy.
Only now I'm busy. Go and talk to your father, he's in there.
Later.
Plus 9 pounds, 3 shillings and
6 pence for last night's dinner.
Plus 4 pounds for my shirt stud.
Remember it's an heirloom of solid gold!
Here's the grand total.
Oh yes. I see.
But you can ask for a bit more than that.
The difference will be yours.
Don't you think just once how marvelous it will be for us to have a real old castle of our own?
All right. But I won't go one penny over 10,000 pounds.
Fine!
I'll go tell Donald!
- No.
I'll tell him.
- Mr. Martin, I thought it over...
Don't make it too hard, Donald.
I want it so much.
- I know you do, Peggy.
But I'm afraid my last price can't be lower than...
2,388 pounds.
- How much did you say?
Here it is.
Well...
That's pretty steep.
But I'll take it.
When can we start tearing it down? - Tearing what down?
Why, the whole works!
We're going to crate it up, stone by stone, and panel by panel, and ship it to America.
You can't do that!
Glourie Castle belongs here, where it's always been!
I'll tell you what I'll do:
I'll give you a contract to come to America and supervise every detail of the reconstruction.
Then...
- No!
I'll never sell it on those terms.
- Donald, please accept the offer.
- I can't.
- Come to America.
- No!
- With us.
No.
This is the castle I was telling you about. I'm taking it back home, stone by stone, and panel by panel.
In fact, I've got some of the paneling crated up right here on this ship.
A much finer specimen than that dinky little chateau of yours.
Oh, Donald!
Shake hands with Mr. Bigelow.
- How do you do. - How do you do.
I was just looking for Peggy.
She's around here someplace with that young Count.
Mr. Bigelow is the man I was telling you about. He bought a chateau.
Mr. Glourie used to own my castle.
So you're the castle salesman, huh?
Congratulations.
And if you ever want a job in my sales force, it's yours.
Thank you very much. If you'll excuse me, I'll go and find Peggy.
What's the idea of congratulating him and then offering him a job?
I'm always on the lookout for brilliant young men who can sell anything.
That darn dog!
- Are you hurt?
- No, I'm all right.
By the way, have you met?
- Mr. Donald Glourie, Count Olivero.
- How do you do.
- How do you do.
That wretched dog has run loose again. Donald, would you mind?
Certainly.
- You play ping-pong? - No, my brain could never work fast enough.
No, your game is Spell Me a Riddle!
What's Spell Me a Riddle?
You know better than I do.
- Are you ready?
- Yes.
Listen to me, Ed Bigelow! I'll tell you something about this castle.
It's said to have a ghost.
- Said to have?
Yes, sir. And I'll bet that's more than you've got with that little old chateau of yours.
- And have you seen the ghost?
- No, but...
- And do you know anyone who has seen it? - No, but I can...
I knew it. Very clever the Scotch.
Very clever indeed!
COSTUME BALL
Prizes Will Be Given For
The Best Costumes
Yes, Father, yes.
But I don't know where I am.
Father, father!
What is this strange place?
Where am I?
On board ship, my son.
On your way to America.
But Father, I don't want to go to America!
I don't want to become a confounded colonist.
You have to go my son,
with the old Glourie Castle which you dishonored,
even to America.
Donald.
When you've rebuilt
Glourie Castle in Florida...
- Yes?
- Why not live in it?
You'll want to live there yourself, won't you?
And more.
Peggy, do you know at this moment I'm a pauper?
What's a pauper?
A man who wants something terribly and can't afford even to say so.
Terribly, Donald?
More than that.
Oh I think it's lovely...
I mean, awful.
Poor Donald.
Hasn't it got cold?
You like a rug?
I'll ask you a riddle!
Yes?
What's the difference betwixt a thistle in the heather and a kiss in the dark?
Now you must answer.
K-I-
L-L-I-E
I give up Donald, and
I pay the forfeit.
Murdoch! My son!
It's really too cold out here.
I'm going in.
- You like to play a game?
- It all depends.
Well I'll ask you a riddle, and if you can't tell me the answer by the time
I've spelt "Killiecrankie", you must pay me a forfeit.
Now what's the difference betwixt a thistle in the heather and a kiss in the dark?
Now wait a minute, my dear, give me time to think.
K-l-L-L- l-E-C-R-A-N-K-l-E.
- I've seen you before.
- Yes, I think you have.
We played games together.
Yes, you're very fond of games, aren't you?
- I love them. - But you always seem to play the same one.
It's only a means to an end.
I understand, and I apologize.
- Apologize for what, dear lady?
- For having misjudged you.
- Your champagne, Peggy.
- Oh yes. Let's go inside.
It's suddenly become very cold. I'm shivering.
Goodbye, Donald.
- But I'm not Donald!
No, you're not the Donald
I thought you were.
Now go tell somebody else the answer to a riddle!
Oh look! Look!
Look at the Scotchman, isn't he marvelous?
Who are you, beautiful Highlander?
I am a ghost.
I am the ghost of Glourie Castle.
If you please sir, look this way!
Won't be a moment.
Now, smile!
Smile? Why?
Take that infernal machine away!
- What happened?
- I don't know.
- Where is he?
- He's disappeared!
- What the... - The most amazing thing I've ever seen!
Wake up! The most unusual thing has happened!
Elmer! Wake up!
The man that appeared in the ballroom, they say he's a ghost!
I just saw him disappear!
Why did you wake me up after midnight with a silly story like this?
Isn't it All Fools Day today?
I haven't touched liquor the whole night.
He walked right through me, I tell you!
Donald! I don't want you to come in here! Get out!
I'm sorry Peggy, but I can't wait any longer to explain that...
I told you there's nothing to explain! Get out!
Now listen to me, Peggy.
One thing I will not accept, and that is your complete misunderstanding of what has happened.
Did you see someone in an ancient Scottish costume?
- I saw you in hurdle!
- No you didn't!
I know it isn't easy to believe, but what you really saw wasn't a man of flesh and blood at all, it was...
A ghost!
A ghost!
There's a ghost on this ship!
- Where?
Of course there is, Mrs. Martin.
I won't have your horrible castle!
You can take back every one of your cursed stones!
- Mother, be quiet!
- And you can keep the money too.
- It's all you wanted of us.
- Come on...
- What's the trouble?
- Ask him, ask him!
- Your wife's seen the ghost.
- Nonsense.
Let's have a drink.
- It's the truth, Mr. Martin.
The ghost of Glourie Castle's on this ship.
And that Miss Shepperton tells me that she saw him too!
Out of consideration for your wife's feelings,
I think we better call the deal off.
What? Just because a couple of nervous women thought they were seeing something?
But they did!
You've got to believe it!
I'll believe it when I see the ghost myself.
Now you run along Donald and leave Mrs. Martín to me.
All right.
- I'll fix everything.
- All right.
Excuse me, sir. Can you tell me where the ghost is?
- You'd really like to see him?
- Yes, sir.
Newspapers all over the world will be wanting photographs.
I'll do my best.
Murdoch!
Now get your camera ready.
He may be here at any moment.
Good evening, Donald Glourie.
Good evening, Murdoch.
Are you afraid of me?
I haven't been afraid of you since I was a child.
I want to tell you that
I'm gravely dissatisfied with that which has come to pass.
You are dissatisfied?
I suppose you know you've ruined my one chance to do something with my life.
Your life? Ha!
Wait until you've been through some centuries, as I have.
Haunting, looking for something, and never finding it.
Say, Donald, I want to...
Say.
Now I'm seeing things!
No, Mr. Martin.
There really are two of us.
Allow me to introduce my ancestor, Murdoch Glourie.
Ancestor?
Yes, my good man.
I am the Glourie ghost.
No.
You're kidding!
Who is this strange spoken fellow?
This is the new owner of Glourie Castle.
He's going to rebuild it in America.
Aren't you, Mr. Martin?
Yes. Stone by stone, and panel by panel.
Good. It will be pleasant to have a home again.
Goodnight, my friend.
Here, Mr. Martin.
Sit down, sit down.
Have a drink of the best.
Yes, a drink of the best.
Try another whisky.
But Mrs. Martin thinks differently, so there's nothing to do but tear up the contract.
Breaks my heart to do it, but my wife's wishes are sacred!
Mr. Glourie, again
I congratulate you.
And you too, Joe. The wireless is humming with news of the phantom.
It'll be a big story in New York, but don't think you can fool me with any publicity stories about your haunted castle!
It isn't publicity, and it isn't my castle anymore.
I've given it back to him.
- Is this true?
- Yes, I'm afraid it is.
- My wife made me do it.
- Well...
I don't mind telling you,
Mr. Glourie, that I'd be interested in buying your castle!
And your performing ghost.
Really? For how much?
Have a cigar.
Wait! I accept, but no one ever paid so much for a front-page story about a ghost.
Front-page story?
What are you doing?
The whole of America is going to learn that a ghost has crossed the Atlantic to advertise the superior merit of the Bigelow chain...
What? You want to use the ghost of my castle for your nasty cheap publicity?
Tough luck Joe. You never should have let it go.
- Have you sold it to him?
- I thought you didn't want it.
Who says I didn't want it?
How much is this crook willing to pay you for it?
100,000 dollars precisely.
Some will say I've been over generous, but that's the way I am.
- I'll give you 125,000!
- Look here Joe, you can't do that.
See here: My daughter discovered this place, and I won't have her discovery exploited to advertise Bigelow's chain groceries!
But your wife will never consent.
My wife has nothing to do with this now. This is business.
All America will soon know that a ghost just crossed the Atlantic to advertise the superior quality of Martin's Fine Foods!
CITY WELCOMES HAUNTED SHIP
WILL HEALTH DEPT PUT
GHOST IN QUARANTINE?
THREE GHOSTS SEEN ON BOAT
GHOST INVASION FROM THE OLD WORLD
The Congress of the United States of America has the duty to call
the attention of every
American citizen to this outrage.
To import a ghost into our progressive country,
to allow a spirit to pervade the free air of the United States
which might be acceptable
in the effete atmosphere of the British House of Lords,
but not here.
Yes, my noble Lords.
The fairest flowers of
Scottish architecture
are being uprooted from their native soil
to be replanted in an alien land
where the very spirit of Scotland has been prohibited for years.
Not enough this, my noble Lords,
not only our castles, but also our ancestors,
who are being shipped over to please the fancy of a millionaire
who apparently has no ancestors of his own.
Not enough gentlemen, the importation of an alien building,
but an alien ghost is also being imported.
What do our immigration authorities say about this?
What does the great city of New York say?
They accord a civic welcome to this relic of medieval superstition...
BIGELOW GROCERIES
Watch out!
Hey! What are you doing in here?
Hands up or I'll shoot!
Father!
Yes, my son?
I don't like America.
It's worse than the day of the battle.
Then I will allow you to remain invisible
until the opportunity comes for revenge.
But if it never comes?
That is your eternal misfortune.
WELCOME TO SUNNYMEDE,
FLORIDA'S LITTLE PARADISE
THE SCOTCH GHOST SNUBS AMERICA
THE GHOST IN A KILT FAILS TO APPEAR
AFTER HIS SHOWY ARRIVAL
I never dreamed they'd be able to make it look so nice and new.
But I only hope that horrible old ghost hasn't found out where they put it.
Don't worry. He'd never be able to recognize it with all those palm trees.
There's Father!
Hello, Dad!
Don't I look like a real
Scotsman now?
Well, almost.
You're pretty good at controlling your enthusiasm, but I'm glad you changed your mind and came down to the big inaugural ceremony.
I didn't come down for that.
I came to see you.
But what's the idea of the gondola?
That's just sort of a
European touch.
Look at that chandelier!
I had it made especially in
Bridgeport, Connecticut.
It's a lot better than all those old smelly candles, eh?
Don't you think we've done a wonderful job of the reconstruction?
Yes Donald, I think you've done fine.
The modern improvements were all Mr. Martin's idea.
But have you really got rid of that ghost?
We've done much better than that!
We've trained him.
Eh, Donald?
Even so, I do not want him in my house.
What's that?
Nothing to be scared of,
Honey. Here.
It's a radio.
Kind of cute, eh, Donald?
I'm afraid I don't fully understand the meaning of the word "cute".
Say, you sound to me like another one of those enthusiasm controllers.
Like Peggy.
She don't like my hat.
- Is Peggy here?
- Yes, just arrived.
Well, come on Gladys.
I'll show you around.
It's going to be absolutely the most magnificent illumination in the history of Florida.
Are you coming, Donald?
Thanks, I'll join you later.
What are you saying?
Open the window!
You were right, Peggy!
I should never have let them turn this castle of mine into an advertisement for groceries!
I've made a fool of myself Peggy, and all because I love you!
If I could talk as well as Murdoch,
I'd have told you long ago that
I love you, but now I must go, and all I'll be able to say is "goodbye".
But I want you to hear that!
What was that, Donald?
What were you saying?
Well...I was...
Donald, the moat is leaking into the wine cellar.
Come and have a look.
All right, Mr. Martin.
I was only trying to tell you that tomorrow I must go.
Donald!
WILL THE GHOST SHOW HIMSELF?
CASTLE INAUGURATION TONIGHT.
PSYCHIC SOCIETY INVITED TO VERIFY
THE EXISTENCE OF JOE MARTIN'S GHOST.
Now we better rehearse that again.
Now you understand?
When I say, "Silence, dont you hear a strange noise?"
- Yes, sir.
- Careful.
Silence!
Don't you hear a strange noise?
That sounded perfect, Bondsdale.
Donald, you stop behind that chair...
Yes? What do I do then?
You say something like...
"Joseph J. Martin and guests,
I greet you."
I'm sorry Mr. Martin, but the
Glourie ghost wouldn't come here especially to extend greetings.
Well okay, say whatever you think's suitable.
But you better run on along and get dressed now, because it's 10:30, and the supper will be starting soon.
And remember! You don't come in until you hear the tray fall, on the line:
"Don't you hear a strange noise".
That's right. You've got it.
- Who is it?
- Are they going to stop?
Mr. Bigelow, do you care to make a statement?
- What kind of a statement?
- We're going to broadcast these events tonight. - Very interesting.
The radio audience wants all possible angles on the ghost.
I'll tell you boys, my angle is this:
When my good friend Joe Martin bought this castle from
Mr. Donald Glourie, it was understood that a ghost went with it.
You see, Mr. Donald Glourie is a Scotchman, and the Scotch are a clever race.
Then I can quote you with saying that the ghost is a fraud?
I'm not saying that.
Not precisely that.
Mr. Martin, if you don't mind my saying so,
I don't think that costume is quite appropriate to a serious scientific meeting like this.
Why, what do you mean?
I have to be faithful to the spirit of this old castle, don't I?
And besides, I know of no one in the United States who has a better right than me to a geniuine Scotch costume.
- Good eveining, Joe.
- Hello, Ed.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is Mr. E. L. Bigelow, who does not believe in ghosts.
Say, why did you put on a disguise?
In honor of your friend, the ghost!
Let me tell you, Ed Bigelow,
Tonight's meeting is scientific.
It is not a fancy dress party.
I'm quite aware, Joe, of the importance of the gathering, but why your own disguise?
I've just been explaining that no one in the United States has a better right.
And now folks, we're going to hear some real Scotch music!
Dad!
Hello. Oh, you're all dressed up.
Are you coming downstairs?
I might come down later.
Is Donald there?
No, he's...gone.
Gone? Where?
I don't know. Away.
But he didn't tell me he was leaving tonight.
You see, he was in a hurry.
And so am I.
Are you really coming down?
No, I don't think I will, now I...
I think you're right.
It will be terribly dull.
Goodnight, Peggy.
- Goodnight, Dad.
Well Donald, they're all here, including Ed Bigelow.
We're going to have a fine time.
- Fine for you perhaps but for me...
All you've got to do is come in, look like the ghost, and then leave.
I know. But it makes me feel such a fool.
You're not backing out, are you?
Oh no. I promised to do it and I shall do it, to the best of my ability.
I have a little present for you here. Look.
Oh yes. Thanks very much.
But I haven't been able to get any whisky out of it.
I don't believe you examined it very closely.
Nice idea, isn't it?
You like it?
- Oh yes, I love it.
I can hardly wait to see Ed
Bigelow's face when you blow in!
Now that's enough!
That's enough!
The music is beautiful, but we mustn't have too much of it.
That's true, but why do you have any at all?
You don't know about that.
You see, it's an old Scots' custom during dinner.
- I don't see Mr. Donald Glourie.
- No, he's...he's gone away.
I see. I thought perhaps that empty chair at the end of the table had been saved for him.
That chair has been reserved for our guest of honor:
Murdoch Glourie, who died 200 years ago.
Murdoch!
Murdoch Glourie!
Aren't you afraid of
Murdoch Glourie?
I couldn't be afraid of anyone
I've known for such a long time.
I'd like to talk to you,
Murdoch Glourie.
And what can a beautiful young girl have to say to a dreary old ghost?
When I first saw you that night in the old castle,
I didn't know what...
Who you were.
Do you remember?
- Yes, I remember, Peggy.
That's the first time you've called me by my name.
But when you say it, it sounds as if you're really Donald.
But if he were speaking to you, you wouldn't listen.
He won't speak to me again.
He's gone.
He wasn't very much interested in me.
- I think you're mistaken, Peggy.
- How do you think that?
Well, because I know him.
He's one of those stupid men who are afraid to be sincere.
He thought you were laughing at him.
I guess I was stupid too.
I couldn't say what was in my heart.
But if he were to come back and say what's in his heart, that he loves you?
If he loved me, he wouldn't have gone away without saying a word to me.
But he wants to say a lot of words to you, and he may not be very far from here.
What would you say to him, Peggy?
I would tell him that I love him.
But he won't come back.
He will come back Peggy!
I promise you!
Silence!
Don't you hear a strange noise?
He's seen him!
The butler's seen him!
Look sharp everybody, he's about to appear.
- Quiet, please be quiet.
- I don't see a thing!
- No, but you will.
- I've got my glasses on, but I don't see anything unusual.
- Where is he?
That's funny,
I distinctly heard sounds like rattling of chains and moaning.
- Chains and moaning?
- Yes, possibly the ghost was just passing near here.
But he'll be back later.
Maybe the phantom's wristwatch is slow and he doesn't know it's past midnight.
Why don't you send one of the servants to page him?
We are bringing you a broadcast
of the big reception for the famous phantom of Glourie Castle.
Outstanding amongst the guests is Mr. E. L. Bigelow,
who expresses the opinion
that the whole ghost story is no more than a gigantic hoax.
Mr. Bigelow has made personal investigations
which indicate that the Glouries are not really a great Scotch family.
Mr. Bigelow follows this
with several other accusations against
Mr. Martin and Mr. Donald Glourie.
He has asked us however
not to make these public until the end of tonight's experiment...
What's the matter, Joe?
Do you hear some more groans or moans or clanking?
The ghosts is here somewhere, but I guess he got lost.
I'll go and find him myself.
- Try whistling for him.
Why, Donald!
I thought that you were gone.
There's been some mistake.
In fact, a rather serious mistake.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I think I can inform you that we shall see no phantom tonight.
Forgive me Mrs. Martin, but there's something I must say to Mr. Bigelow.
Go ahead and say it my friend.
I'm listening.
It had better be said outside.
Then I'm afraid you'll have to wait until I'm ready to leave.
I see that you and Joe are wearing the same tartan.
Do you belong to Martin's
Fine Foods' clan?
Don't you talk to him about tartans! He's a real Scotsman.
Possibly, but I happen to be connected with a family far more important than the Glouries.
I've never heard of the clan Bigelow.
No, this tartan belongs to the clan of my mother's ancestors, of which I am the last representive.
It's the tartan of the distinguished clan MacLaggan.
- Did you say MacLaggan? - Yes,
MacLaggan. Take your hands off me!
Murdoch! Murdoch!
Did you hear that?
Where is this MacLaggan?
Right there.
The fellow with the kilt.
Very good joke, Mr. Glourie.
Very amusing, indeed!
Get away from me!
MacLaggan!
I told you to get away from me!
I don't like practical jokes!
You're not scaring me.
Turn, MacLaggan!
Now, will you have the goodness to repeat these words after me?
Yes sir. Yes sir.
Anything you say, sir!
In the name of every MacLaggan whoever disgraced the fair name of Scotland...
In the name of every MacLaggan whoever disgraced the fair name of Scotland...
I humbly apologize for the insult to my superiors, the Glouries.
I humbly apologize for the insult to my superiors, the Glouries.
And I freely admit that one Glourie can thrash 50 MacLaggans.
Can thrash 50 MacLaggans.
Now, touch the floor with your nose.
Farewell, last of the MacLaggans.
Father! Father!
Is that enough?
Yes, my son!
Your mission is fulfilled,
and now if you wish,
you may join your noble ancestors in Heaven.
I do wish, for I have grown very very weary of this earth.
Thank you Donald, for finding me a MacLaggan.
It was a pleasure, Murdoch. And now I suppose you'll be leaving us.
Yes, I'm very happy to go.
I leave you now to defend the honor of our great name.
Farewell, last of the Glouries.
Farewell, kinsman.
Now smile, smile.
The reporters are here.
They want you to make a statement about that famous fraud, the Glourie ghost.
Is it true that you saw it,
Mr. Bigelow?
What did he look like?
- Did he say anything?
- Did he do anything?
Leave him alone, he's not feeling so good.
Come now, I want you to see absolutely the finest display in the history of Florida, provided by Martin's Fine Foods.
And now Donald, why don't you tell me the answer to the riddle?
I can't tell you the answer, but for the honor of the Glouries,
I must give you back the forfeit. subs by ironhills for KG

That's how the cheat imagines his gesture, faster than lightning.
You should know that the child's guardian angel appeared.
He came out of an empty house.
He was black in color and limped slightly with his left foot.
The cloak, spread out like an ink stain disappeared under the work of the supernatural being who grew paler as he absorbed his prey.
Having achieved her purpose, the woman became a statue once more, or, in other words, an inhuman object with black gloves in contrast to the snow upon which her steps would no longer leave a trace.
