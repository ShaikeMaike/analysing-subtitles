Still.
Wiegend.
I wish to enrol.
To enrol? Certainly?
This way...if you please.
Keine Bewegung, bitte.
Moment, bitte.
Außergewöhnlich...
Sir? Herr Benjamenta?
I'm here to enrol.
These are students I have hammered into Europe.
Bitte, setzen.
Asseyez-vous!
So...Name. Date of birth.
It's on the concession.
Und so weiter, und so weiter.
Etc, etc...
..etc, etc.
Das ist?
Ah...
Von Gunten.
Eintausend, zweitausend, dreitausend, viertausend, fünftausend.
Jakob.
A few other details, Herr von Gunten.
Wollen doch mal sehen.
Ja.
Ganz gute Reaktion.
I have sought entrance to the Institute Benjamenta as a student...
..in order to acquire the necessary knowledge for being a servant...
..as I have no high hopes of life.
I hope - no I am quite certain - that I am fit.
I...
Glitschig.
I hope I am quite certain that in some measure
I am fit to be of service to someone in this life.
To someone in this life.
Jakob von Gunten wishes to affirm that he...
Drei, vier, fünf, sechs.
..wishes to affirm that it is a matter of indifference to him what he is ordered to
Sechs, sieben, acht, neun...
..as his modesty knows no bounds.
Zwölf.
Ja...ein kapitaler Zwölfender.
Ugh. Agh.
It's good your hair is short.
There's an epidemic of tics...
..in the forest here.
You can put aside any idea of preferential treatment.
You're all one size here.
You can go now, von Gunten.
The class of life has already started.
Don't I get a receipt?
Go! Raus!
Kapitaler Zwölfender.
Flammenartige...
I refer you to your manuals, the chapter headed...
..The Divine Duty of Servants.
Danke.
Jakob von Gunten.
Gut.
Herr Jakob, these are your fellow students.
Kraus.
Auclair. Barcelonnette.
Fridolin. Fisoloebede.
Schilinski. Nyepertatikva.
Jorgenson. Aarhus.
Hebling. Fnetenberbel.
Pepino. D'Agrigento.
Inigo. Euskadikoa.
One.
Service is a beautiful, gold flower, full of...
We have to learn the rules by heart.
There is but one lesson here...
..endlessly repeated...
..over and over again.
One will learn very little here.
And none of us will amount to much.
Later in life, we shall all be something very small and subordinate.
..are his ears at the word of command, and folded and pressed at all times are his lips.
Except to say, 'Yes, sir, at once, sir. Of course, sir.'
Next page.
Herr Jakob, will you please join us next time?
Three.
The satisfaction of his master shall be the servant's heaven.
The woeful opposite is his annihilating hell.
Can't. Can't. Can't eat this. It's impossible.
I won't. I won't.
I won't stand up until you promise me a decent room to sleep in.
Fräulein Benjamenta, I beg of you.
You... You won't ever, never, never, never, have to complain about my behaviour again.
Is that so?
I shall never have to complain?
Such a fuss about where to lay your head.
Hm.
Go up.
Is this more to your liking?
Well, it's small... and the window scarcely merits the name.
There are no curtains, but don't be angry, Fräulein, I like it.
Even if the sun never gets a look in.
I like it.
Thank you.
Well...
Well, now my comrades are sure to feel offended.
And now be quiet, Herr Jakob.
Class commences at eight. Kraus will collect you.
Good night.
I shall never let myself be rescued...
..nor shall I ever rescue anybody.
Why can't there be a light in the light, instead of just in the dark?
Perhaps I shall never put out roots and branches.
One day, some fragrance will issue from my being and I will flower.
I will bow my head, and my arms and legs will sag.
Everything will wither and fade...
..and I will be dead.
Not really dead.
Only in a certain sort of way.
Dead.
Then I will go on dying for perhaps another 60 years.
Instead of older, I grew younger.
Whoever thinks this possible will be happy for the rest of his life.
Once great snowflakes fell in the castle courtyard.
To live on here until the winter only.
Then when it begins to snow...
Oh...
It can snow upon us so gently... so intensely...
..in such an immense...
..silence.
Neither beginning nor end, everything in a grey-white snowing...
..no more sky, no more air.
No more streets.
Rule the world.
Sometimes more life lies hidden in the opening of a door than in a question.
Past and future circle about us - now we know more...
..now we know less.
To the deer forests.
And what was the institute before it was the institute?
Is life sketching a more subtle sketch than I?
Here they find the things Fräulein Benjamenta teaches us...
..worth knowing.
It isn't much and we are always revising.
But perhaps there is some hidden meaning to all these nothings.
We grasp a thing and it is as if it possessed us.
Not we possess it, but it us.
Sir, I have rescued the cat from the tall tree in the garden.
Be careful, Viscount, the steeple, it is wobbling!
Agh!
Be careful, Viscount, the church steeple, it is wobbling.
Agh!
Be careful...
Your Highness, don't eat the schnitzel. It's...
Agh!
The institute is no place for your vile fantasies,
Duchess.
Please remove your hand from my knee.
Wake up, wake up, Duchess!
There's a fire in the nursery!
Wake up!
Wake up, wake up, Duchess!
There's a fire in the nursery!
I have placed the children in the care of the chief of the fire brigade.
There is no need to worry.
Look, there are only minor burns to my left side.
You go to the children. Forget about me.
Yes, I forgive you for you know not what you do.
I forgive you, Your Highness, for you know not what you do.
Wake up, wake up, Duchess!
There's a fire in the nursery!
Kraus?
He behaves as if he plans staying here for another century.
'Wait for it' is engraved on his skull.
How are you, Jakob? Are you all right?
Have you settled in?
Of course, Fräulein. Thank you.
And you get on with the other students?
I respect them all without exception.
And yet you quarrel with Kraus, no?
Listen to me, Jakob.
God gives a Kraus to this world in order to entrust it with a deep and insoluble riddle.
This riddle will never be understood because there isn't a single person alive...
..who will guess that there is some delicate meaning...
..behind this name, this...
..monosyllabic, inconspicuous Kraus.
No-one will ever be grateful to Kraus, nor is gratitude necessary.
Kraus will never go to ruin because there will always be great and loveless difficulties confronting him.
I think that I...
I am perhaps the only person who realises what we have in Kraus.
Or have had in him.
Slaap soet.
The way they live here with us students...
Are these the inner chambers?
Will I ever reach them?
Nameless...
..monosyllabic...
..inconspicuous...
..Kraus.
Tell me, don't you find life here...
..sterile?
Sterile, huh?
My mind is dying.
Forgive me for speaking so...
..intimately...
..for being so weak.
You are probably secretly laughing at me.
But watch out!
See that wall?
I could throw you against it so hard, you would never see or hear anything again.
But don't be afraid.
I couldn't hurt you.
It's so nice to talk with you.
Like we are almost related.
The way you speak... your gestures...
..your mouth...
..everything.
It's delightful to behave in that... rather weak sort of way with you.
Just think... me... your master...
..confessing to you.
My pathetic little worm...
..whom I could utterly crush... if I chose to.
Give me your hand.
Good.
I have to tell you... you've gained my respect...
..and now...
..I have a request.
Would you...?
Will you be my confidante?
Someone to share all of my secrets.
I'm asking you...Jakob.
But you may have time to think it over.
Please. Go.
Go now, Jakob.
It's time.
Kwart oor drie.
The same thing.
Over and over again.
Glaub mir, Lisa. Wirklich.
The moment I clapped my eyes on this figure,
I realised it was Jesus...
..as large as life, standing in front of me.
So...he wasn't dead.
He was right there before me in the snow...
..tenderly...beckoning to me.
And with his celestial but shy eyes all aglow, full of wondrous...
..terrible light.
I threw my entire being into the apparition.
And I asked myself, 'What's Jesus up to, here, on the edge of the city?
Is there really anything for him to do in this world, to concern himself with?
And if yes, what would be the most likely way he'd choose to...
..make himself known to us?'
And what do you think...
And a nice, big zero for you.
Look.
The sun.
Our plant.
How beautiful!
Johannes, it's 1:15.
It always strikes our planet at this time.
- Plant, I said.
- Yes, planet.
Why are there no longer any real seasons here?
Johannes, we never speak any more.
Lisa...
People... who know each other as well as we do...
..don't need to make small talk.
Who know each other as well as we do?
Brother and sister, I mean.
Snow White...
..waiting for life to stir her.
Lisa...
Lisa?
Dead.
To be nothing more than dead and smiling.
How I hurt beneath this sun.
I, who have never known the hot gusts of life.
Lisa...
Lisa...
I hadn't heard the Fräulein come in.
She laid her hand on my shoulder, as if she were weary and needed support.
I almost felt as though I belonged to her then.
Come with me, Jakob.
I want to show you something.
Oh, how beautiful it is here, Jakob. lf only you could see it.
But you mustn't.
That is not for you.
But you may feel.
The ice, Jakob.
How it waits.
How patiently it waits and grows.
Kiss it, Jakob.
Kiss the ice.
It is I, your teacher, Lisa Benjamenta, who asks you.
Don't let it steal your breath away!
That taste is your blood.
Come away.
There is warmth, Jakob.
You can find warmth.
Look for it, Jakob.
Look for it.
Is your heart on fire? Yes.
It burns.
But can it hold back the ice?
It's still there, Jakob. The ice.
It's still waiting.
I can't feel you, Jakob!
I can't feel you.
Suddenly, I was back, sitting at my desk.
Fräulein Benjamenta was still standing behind me.
She stroked my cheeks.
But it was as if she were comforting herself, not me.
Am I living in a fairy tale?
Am I living in a fairy tale?
Yours, so shyly.
So shyly.
Yours...
My young saplings...sap... lf only...
I could be with...
..my dwarves.
My young saplings.
Saplings.
If only I could be with...saplings...
Paying attention...you're not...
Saplings...pay attention...
My young saplings.
Saplings.
My young saplings...
You're not paying attention.
I refer you to your manual.
The chapter headed The Divine Duty of Servants.
The section entitled...
Snares and Temptations...
..which is...
Can you hear me?
..which is...
Repeat after me.
Sobering, succinct...
..salutary advice...
..for those about to commit the sin of thinking themselves above their station.
This phenomenon is known as...
Pepino!
Hebling...
Inigo...
Inigo! Inigo!
Inigo!
This phenomenon is known as...
How everything is changing here.
No new students are enrolling at the institute.
Everything has become so...
..fragile.
Often the Fräulein stares out of the window, as if she were already living somewhere else.
Yet the lessons continue.
We're still caught in the grip of the rules and indulge in monotonous repetitions.
I've finally been inside the inner chambers...
..and I have to say...
..they don't exist.
Instead of a mystery, there's only a goldfish.
And Kraus has taught me how to clean out its bowl...
..change its water...
..and feed it.
Fräulein Lisa said something very strange to me.
'Jakob,' she said...
Jakob...
This must be for your ears only.
Something is gnawing at me.
Like this.
See how I am breathing on you?
That is how he's breathing his cold breath on me...
..from behind.
I'm sinking...
My breath is being crushed from me.
I am dying from...
..those who could have seen and held me.
I'm dying from...
..the emptiness of cautious and clever people.
Enough.
Now you must forget about all of this.
No-one must know.
Especially not my brother.
To be allowed to obey her...
As long as I obey her, she will live.
Whatever is forbidden lives...
..a hundred times over.
Herr Benjamenta...
Jakob von Gunten here.
You summoned me?
..or something very... delicate.
You see, Jakob... how I know the words by heart?
Because... it is my heart that speaks them.
Jakob...
Couldn't we...
Could we try, you and l...
The low and the mighty.
Could we just try to stand up to life together?
Shoulder to shoulder.
Side by side.
But Herr Benjamenta...
You are my principal.
This place is finished. Don't you understand?
I'm not accepting any more students. You were the last one.
You thought...
..the...Institut Benjamenta...
..was one of those places here today... and gone tomorrow?
It's you.
You are the one.
It's...all happened since you came.
Who are you?
Oh, Jesus...
Goodbye, Jakob.
Kiss me, Jakob.
Just once.
Be soft.
Shhh-shhh.
Enough.
No despair.
Everything is good just the way it is.
It's beautiful, isn't it...
..not to want anything any more?
From now on, it can only be evening in this world.
And all about me. lmagine me...coming for you.
Surely... the King is dead.
Twice over.
Jakob...
Jakob, I'm so...lonely.
Herr Benjamenta...
Sleep. Rest sweetly, dear Fräulein.
The Fräulein lay there lifeless, just as she told me she would.
Her eyes were still open. Not very wide...
..but as if she was still smiling.
And it seemed to me that she must live for eternity...
..only to be for eternity no living being.
The sound of thy voice shall live on.
We withdrew, leaving the brother with the sister.
The Principal with the Principaless.
The lonely man with the lonely woman.
The living person with the dead one.
I shall surely go on living, but what will become of you?
Do something.
Look behind the curtain...Jakob.
Look behind the curtain.
She may be hiding here.
Once...
..I was crowned with success.
The world smiled on me.
But I hated the world.
Hated existing.
Hated those I taught to take orders.
Hated myself for loving to give orders.
Everything.
I hated it all.
But no longer.
Now...
..that I'm not a king...
Now...
..I want to live.
I'm hungry for life!
Jakob...
Everyone has gone. Even Kraus.
I've pronounced the institute dead.
We are free.
Jakob...
Come with me.
Follow me...
..out of this world...
..for ever.
And it will snow upon us so intensely...
..in such immense silence.
Neither beginning nor end.
Everything in a grey, white...snowing.
No more sky.
No more air.
In us the sound of thy voice shall live on.
Follow me to a place where incredible feats
Are routine every hour or so
Where enchantment runs rampant
Yes, wild in the streets
Open sesame, here we go!
Arabian nights
Like Arabian days
They tease and excite
Take off and take flight
They shock and amaze
Arabian nights
Like Arabian days
More often than not are hotter than hot
In a lot of good ways
Pack your shield, pack your sword
You won't ever get bored
Though get beaten or gored you might
Come on down, stop on by
Hop a carpet and fly
To another Arabian night
Arabian night
This night has been quite rewarding.
We have never stolen so much.
We have gathered much loot tonight.
No thanks to our leader.
Well, it only looked expensive.
Is this a haul or what, my surly band of desert skunks?
How is it you get the jeweled flower, Abis Mal?
Why, this is my bonus for being your beloved leader.
This and that and that are my beloved leader bonus.
And what is our reward?
Hmm?
Here you go. Good work, boys.
Very successful raid.
- The chest!
- It moves!
- It cannot be!
- What is holding it up?
Ghosts!
Hello.
You stupid monkey!
Put him down, Abis Mal!
Who are you?
My friends call me Al.
You can call me Aladdin.
Hurt him!
- What?
- Where did he go?
- There!
- He has our loot!
Don't let him get away!
- He must not escape!
- Stop him!
- Why, you...
- Hey!
He's getting away!
- There he is!
- We've got him now!
A flying carpet?
He's got a flying carpet!
Nice catch, Carpet.
Hey!
Pardon me!
Yeah!
Come back here!
That's mine! Whoa!
Next stop, Agrabah.
- Shut the door!
- He's escaping!
Finally!
This is terrific!
I got sand in places
I didn't even know I had.
Spare me your prattling, Iago!
Are we out yet?
"Are we out yet? Are we out yet?"
Yes, we're out! No thanks to you.
If it weren't for me... you'd be stuck down there forever.
Iago!
You will now release me... so that I may have my revenge.
Yeah, yeah, when I'm good and ready.
Do as I say, you worthless pipsqueak!
You know something?
You're nothing without me.
What?
Who comes up with all the good ideas? Me!
Who does all the work? Me!
If it weren't for me... you still be in a cage at the bazaar... squawking, "Polly want a cracker!"
That's it, I've had it
I hate to be dramatic
But it's time for me to fly the coop
Terrific, fine
I'm drawing the line
Before I wind up in a parrot soup
I was a fool to let you run the show
I'm cuttin' you loose, pal
Look out below
Arrividerci, c'est la vie
Hope all goes well
I'm lookin' out for me
Agrabah... just a juicy golden goose ready for plucking... and I'm the one holdin' the tweezers!
I'll be runnin' this town inside a week!
What's your problem, liver lips?
You don't think I can do it?
OK, I'm little
Been playin' second fiddle
And I don't get no respect
I turn the other cheek
But this busted beak
Is the only thanks that I get
I never found a friend that I can trust
They promise caviar and leave me eating dust
That's some reward for loyalty
From here on in
I'm lookin' out for me
Ohh, I don't need nobody else
I'll never fail
I'll cover my own tail
I can take care of myself
You know, it just don't pay to give a hoot
I've given all my heart
What do I get? The boot
I'm through with that
I'm flappin' free
From here on in
I'm lookin' out for me
Steal from us again... and your scrawny body will be dinner for the jackals!
Sure. No problem.
Huh?
No! No!
- Abu!
- No!
We're not the ones who need this money.
A miracle.
Rain on me!
Gold from the heavens!
Don't worry, Abu.
I'm not throwing everything.
Yes!
This is for Jasmine.
No!
Whoa!
Uh-oh.
Easy, Rajah. You know me. Aladdin?
OK, Rajah, OK.
I'm glad to see you, too.
How do I look?
- I think you look fine.
- Jasmine!
Where were you? I missed you.
I had to pick up a few things.
This is for you.
Oh, Aladdin! It's lovely!
"It's lovely."
It must have cost a fortune.
Oh, no, it was a steal.
Father wants you to join us for dinner tonight.
He's going to make a royal announcement.
And he wants me there?
It's about you.
Am I in trouble?
Let's just say... this is a dinner you don't want to miss.
Jasmine, what's going on?
I promised Father
I wouldn't spoil his surprise.
You've made quite an impression, you know.
So I'm not in trouble?
Of course not.
You defeated Jafar, saved Agrabah... and rescued a princess.
Aladdin, you are a hero.
Yeah, I guess so.
That's me. Ready for anything!
Abu!
You may want to change before dinner, though.
Seems like only yesterday
Jafar was runnin' Agrabah.
And I was his right-hand bird.
But then he had to go and mess things up!
Now I'm stuck on the outside looking in.
I gotta get back into the palace!
Back into power!
Well, my dear Abu... shall we see what the common folk are doing today?
Let's go!
We have time for a stroll before our audience with the sultan.
The street rat is living in the palace now?
That does it! All reports are in!
Life is now officially unfair!
Wait! Wait a second here!
This is perfect!
That kid is my ticket back into power.
I'll just get Aladdin on my side with a little sympathy act.
Then I'll be back in the palace again... quicker than you can say "Easy Street."
- Aladdin!
- Huh?
Kid... finally... got free... of... Jafar.
Iago! What are you doing here?
Where are you? Getting dark...
Hold me...
Hey, I meant gentle-like!
You're not fooling anyone!
No, wait, I'm serious!
I was under Jafar's power!
He mesmerized me with his snake staff!
Just like the sultan.
You traitor, you!
You look familiar.
It's Aladdin.
Where? It is? I knew that!
Hurt him a lot!
Hurt him and his monkey and his bird, too!
Uh-oh.
Treacherous parrot!
Look, I'm not with him!
Monkey, help! They're after me!
You won't dance out of this one!
That's it! Now I'm mad!
Mess with this bird, huh?
Huh?
And I got more where that came from!
My eggs... ruined!
Who will pay for them?
Oh, go away.
Guards! Guards!
What is the trouble here?
It is that thief Abis Mal!
Whoa!
After them!
Jerks.
Thanks for your help. You saved me.
I did? Right! Oh, yeah!
Of course I saved you! It's my nature.
I'm always rescuing things.
Cats, babies, guys like you, always rescuing.
Hey, what's going on?
Is this any way to treat your rescuer?
You owe me, pal! I saved your life!
Abu, wait!
He's right. I do owe him.
Huh?
I'll see that the sultan gives him a fair hearing.
What? The sultan?
Don't worry, I'll talk to him.
Soften him up a little.
Are you kidding? He hates me!
And what about the princess?
Hmm? No problem.
I just have to make sure that Jasmine doesn't see you... until I've gotten her prepared.
Gotten me prepared for what?
I mean... for the... for the stain...
Abu got on the brand new vest you gave him.
I did not!
I don't see a stain.
Well, no problem, then. Off to dinner.
Can't wait for that surprise.
- Is something wrong?
- Huh? Wrong? Oh, come on!
No, no, no, everything's just fine.
You aren't hiding anything from me, are you?
Any more secrets?
Secrets?
Of course not!
I almost lost you once that way.
I'll never make that mistake again.
What?
He's big and he's blue and he's back!
- Genie!
- You came back!
Watch the sunburn!
A-ha! Kidding!
Did you miss me? Be honest.
Take care of these, my good mammal.
Whoa!
Careful, they're heavy!
Hang on, I got souvenirs for everybody!
She dances!
You saw the whole world already?
It's a small world after all
But Agrabah has something... that no other place in the world has.
You guys!
I parachuted down into the Taj Mahal
I Rollerbladed all along the great Great Wall
I even made the famous leaning tower fall
But who was with me through it all?
Nobody
The Moscow Circus hired me to fly trapeze
On Mount Olympus, won a race with Hercules
It's easy when you're chased by killer bees
Who said "Gesundheit" when I sneezed?
So now I'm home
Home again with you
You chase the clouds away
Whenever I am blue
You're always blue.
Land of the pyramids
I highly recommend
There is nothing in the world
Quite like a friend
Slept like a babe in Bombay on a bed of nails
Moroccans loved my daring Dance of Seven Veils
Why, single-handedly,
I even saved the whales
No one was there to hear my tales
In Acapulco, joined a mariachi band
I rode the raging rapids down the Rio Grande
Flew in an air balloon, but when I tried to land
Nobody laughed or lent a hand
Without you, the Amazon is just a trickle
Without you, the Sahara's not so hot
Without you, Niagara Falls is just a leaky faucet
The QE2 is just some yacht
Now that I'm home
Home again, it's clear
All I ever wanted
Seems to be right here
I've traveled east and west
And now I'm back again
And there's nothing in the world
Quite like a friend
There's nothing in the world
Nothing in the whole wide world
There is nothing in the world
Quite like a friend
Nothing in the whole wide world
So, Genie, how does it feel to be free?
Seriously? I love it!
OK, maybe my powers aren't what they used to be.
Let's say they're semi-phenomenal... nearly cosmic, but don't sell me short.
I may be free, but I still have some magic in me.
I can still do this!
Hey!
Hate to lose face in front of you guys.
Give me another chance.
Who's first? I can do this!
- Genie, we have to go to...
- Dinner! We're late!
You probably have a romantic dinner for two planned.
You don't need a big blue lug gumming up the works.
- But, Genie...
- Three's a crowd.
You kids go on.
Genie, I would be honored if you'd join us for dinner.
You would?
Come on, everyone! Get in here!
Home cookin'? Let's go!
Oh, boy!
Not you, Abu.
You have a job to do, remember?
- Huh?
- You have to guard Iago!
Giddy-up, slow-poke. What's keepin' ya?
Nothing!
Well, something, but I'll tell you later.
That stinking Aladdin.
First chance I get,
I'll slice him in half.
That stinking Abis Mal.
First chance we get, let's slice him in half.
Hey, get over here and wash up!
It's bad enough I have to look at you... without having to smell you.
Come, we do it now. No witnesses.
What is this? So help me,
I'll sue whoever runs this well.
A lamp. Well, well, it might be worth... a few shekels once it's cleaned up.
It will be of little use to you, Abis Mal!
Except to light your way to the Valley of the Dead!
It is bewitched!
I am free!
Free to exact vengeance upon he who has imprisoned me!
It is the curse of the lamp.
All the power in the universe... and I am bound by the rules of the genie!
Which means I can't kill that upstart Aladdin!
Unless I have someone arrange it for me.
Take me to Agrabah at once!
I suppose I am a bit too much for his limited mind.
I trust you'll find me a little less overwhelming now?
You're... a genie?
You are astonishingly perceptive.
If you're a genie, then don't I get wishes?
Yes, three wishes.
That is a minor formality.
But, first, I must go to Agrabah.
You will take the lamp there for me.
Then... you need me.
I'll take you to Agrabah... but, first, I want my wishes.
Why, you...
You shall have your wishes.
I shall? I mean, of course I shall!
Oh, I want... I want riches, treasure!
Let's see, I know...
I wish for the legendary sunken treasure ship... of Coeur Du Mer!
Your wish is my command.
Poor sweet baby.
Aren't we enjoying our wish?
Perhaps you wish me to return you to the desert?
Yes!
Very well.
That was two wishes.
Take your time with the third.
Or you will wish you had never been born.
On the other hand, if you cooperate with me...
I will see that you are amply rewarded.
Rewarded?
First, you will help me get revenge... on a certain street rat by the name of... Aladdin.
Aladdin?
I want revenge on him, too!
He robbed me, turned my men against me... and he fought dirty!
My brilliant swordsmanship availed me nought!
I hate when I do that.
Let's not be too hasty, my simple-minded friend.
It's not enough that we simply destroy Aladdin.
After all, there are things so much worse than death.
OK, prepare yourselves for a real culinary treat.
Oh-ho-ho-ho, my!
Whoopsie.
Most amusing!
Amusing, right.
Excuse me while I pull myself together.
Absolutely delightful!
Now, to business.
Aladdin, you have proven to be a man... of strong moral character.
That is why I've decided to make you... my new royal vizier.
Me? Really?
Isn't it wonderful?
Wow! Royal vizier!
Aladdin would like to thank the Academy... for this great honor!
You want 'em? We got 'em!
Royal vizier t-shirts!
All hail Aladdin, the royal vizier!
So, what's a royal vizier?
Well... he will be my most trusted advisor.
Well, that makes sense.
He's bound to be better than that Jafar character.
Quite so!
And Iago... talk about a rat with wings!
- Genie?
- That bird was mean!
Sultan want a cracker? Remember that?
I can still taste them! The traitor!
Yes, sir! You don't see this guy... hanging out with any evil parrots!
It's funny you should mention Iago.
Oh, monkey!
Come on! Monkey, little birdie want to talk to monkey.
Have nice banana.
Birdie get monkey a pretty banana... if monkey open cage. Yum yum!
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Come on! I've got a wife and three eggs!
Imagine them hatching, never knowing their daddy!
Come on, open the cage!
Open it! Open it! Open it!
Yeah, that's more like it.
Close the cage!
Close it! Close it! Close it!
Uh-oh!
Your monkey's trying to kill me!
I saved your life!
It's payback time, Aladdin!
Whoa!
Aladdin!
Rajah! You know better... than to tear around the palace like that!
Help! Hey!
So, Aladdin... why did you bring up that deceitful parrot?
Sultan, I have to tell you something about Iago.
He's here.
Iago! Guards!
- No, wait!
- Get that bird!
Yes, Your Highness.
It would be my pleasure.
No, Sultan! No!
Move out of my way, boy!
You don't understand! Just listen!
- I have a...
- Your Highness!
I trust he has a fitting explanation... for this... this scandal?
He had better.
Your Highness, I think Iago was...
Mesmerized.
Yeah, yeah! He was under Jafar's spell.
Remember the snake staff?
Iago was only... Look, I just...
Iago's not all that bad.
At least I don't think so anyway.
Shoulda stuck with the snake staff defense.
"Not all bad"?
He only served my greatest enemy, that's all!
We can't allow that traitorous bird to run free!
Then I'll watch him!
You Highness, I meant, with your permission...
I'd like to take full responsibility for Iago.
You would?
Your priorities seem questionable to me... but so be it.
Aladdin, you will watch
Iago every moment.
And if the bird makes one wrong move... you shall be the one I pluck, boy.
That could've gone worse.
Oh, Jasmine, I thought I was sunk.
Not good!
You were hiding Iago all along, weren't you?
I think it just got worse.
Well, yes, but...
How could you? More secrets? More lies?
Aladdin, I thought you had changed.
Jasmine, wait!
Back in the marketplace...
Iago... he... he saved my life.
Some grand vizier I'm gonna make.
Everybody's mad at me.
Hey, Jasmine's just a little steamed.
She'll cool down. Care for a cup?
This isn't cheering you up, is it?
I don't get it, Genie.
I try to do something good and it blows up in my face!
That's the problem with doing the right thing.
Sometimes you do it by yourself.
That kid saved my life.
Nobody's ever looked out for me before.
Now, it's like I owe him.
Nah!
Just let your conscience be your guide.
Conscience? Never had one. Never.
What are you trying to do, give me a heart attack?
A-ha! You do have a heart!
An itty-bitty one, but it is there.
Can you quit with the hocus pocus already?
Look at him.
Would it kill you to do something nice for him?
Possibly. I don't do "nice."
Oh, come on! It’ll be fun!
I don't do fun, either!
We have to get Al and the princess back together!
Look, I definitely don't do mushy stuff!
It's not me!
I know, but it's going to be tricky.
Tricky is good.
Tricky I can do.
Come on, Princess!
Don't waste your tears on him.
You! You get out of here!
Hey, don't take it out on me!
He's the creep.
I never should have saved his life.
Saved his life?
Yeah. He owed me one.
That's why he stood up for me.
But he didn't have to lie to me.
You are so right.
Forget about that guy
Forget about the way you fell into his eyes
Forget about his charms
Forget about the way he held you in his arms
Walking on air's obnoxious
The thrills, the chills
Will make you nauseous
And you'll never get enough
Just forget about love
She's buying it!
Now make with the magic!
Forget about romance
Forget about the way your heart begins to dance
Then you feel the blush
When he's spouting out some sentimental mush
Love really is revolting
It's even worse than when you're molting
Enough of this fluff
Just forget about love
I had almost forgotten the way it felt
When he held out his hand for mine
My heart all a-flutter
Oh, how I shudder
The first time we kissed
It won't be missed
Forget about his touch
I can't forget about his touch
In the scheme of things it doesn't matter much
It matters so much
You're better on your own
A meal becomes a banquet when you eat alone
Love's filled with compromises
And don't you hate those big surprises
A cozy rendezvous
Oh, please
Candlelight for two
Oh, jeez
Look, you're calling my bluff
- I can't forget about love
- Just forget about love
Jasmine, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have kept
Iago a secret. Please...
Aladdin, you don't have to...
I can't forget about my heart
And how it felt to fall for you right from the start
I'm still falling
Whatever we may do
You are here for me and I'll be there for you
I'll be there
To wish, to want, to wander
To find the sun through rain and thunder
A cozy rendezvous
Yes, please
Candlelight for two
Oh, jeez
Enough is enough
We can't forget about love
We did it! We're in!
It's about time. It was getting hot.
How very like Iago.
He's lost no time endearing himself to those in power.
Which fits in perfectly with my plan.
I'm sorry, Jasmine.
Ahh, love.
Don't mind us.
Yeah, well, this is kind of a special moment.
Right. Got it. Say no more.
Enough said. Roger. Over and out.
Rolling!
Today's special moments are tomorrow's memories.
Looking great, Jas. More emotion, Al.
Tilt your chin a bit.
What does he have to do... to make it clear to you lunkheads?
The show's over. They want to be alone!
Break it up!
Are you sure about him?
Move it, primate! Shoo! Go on!
That takes care of the peanut gallery.
If you need me...
I'll be lazing about in the lap of luxury.
I'm sure about this.
Ohh, yeah!
Being one of the good guys has its advantages.
Advisor to Aladdin... the new grand vizier.
And when Aladdin becomes sultan... that will make me the grand vizier.
Only I'm not gonna blow it like that idiot Jafar.
I'll never have to stand in his shadow again.
Jafar!
Buddy?
A funny thing happened.
You see, this guy took the lamp.
You probably thought it was me...
'cause it sounded a lot like me... but a lot of people sound like me.
Anyway, he took the lamp and...
Calm yourself, Iago.
I haven't come for revenge against you.
So that's good to hear.
I got it! I could wish for... the famed treasure chest of King Malakhan!
I am dreadfully sorry.
I thought that was your wish.
Are you quite all right?
No, I am not quite...
Wonderful. Good to see all is well.
Abis Mal here is my new friend... and I couldn't help noticing... that you've made some new friends, too.
Like... Aladdin.
Friend? Friend is such a strong word.
He's more like an acquaintance.
I'm arranging a little surprise for Aladdin... and your job is to lead him to the party.
You know, I don't think
I'm the guy for this job.
You know, you should talk to... the monkey!
Yeah! The monkey's really got
Aladdin's ear!
No, Iago... you!
You know, Aladdin... AI... here's an idea.
I was just thinking...
Focus... focus.
Focus... focus... focus... focus...
Aiming... and...
Shoot!
Sorry, little feathered friend.
I'll get that out.
It's stuck good.
Cueball-ectomy! Nurse!
Abu! Iago here's our friend now.
We can trust him.
Now, let's get that ball... out of his beak. What do you say?
OK.
Brilliant, Nurse Heimlich!
Thanks... Bobo.
- It's Abu.
- Whatever.
That's the spirit!
We're all one big family now!
Yeah, sure. Family.
Oh, brother.
Yeah, well, I gotta find Al.
Your shot.
Pool's a man's game... so being a rug, you'll be at a disadvan...
Pool's a dumb game anyway.
I can't explain it, Jasmine.
I think we can trust Iago.
Well... then I guess
I can give him a chance.
Iago?
I... I was just thinking.
Maybe it's time you patched things up with the sultan.
He might enjoy... a nice scenic carpet ride?
- That's a good idea.
- And I'll bring Genie.
He was a big hit with the sultan.
No, no, no!
I mean, Genie's... he's too flashy!
He's too loud!
You'll never get a word in.
Good point, Iago.
You need some quiet time with Father.
Let him get to know you.
Yeah! And I...
I can take you to the perfect spot.
- Great!
- Come on, let's get Father.
Just a minute.
Iago? This isn't easy for me to say... but I was wrong about you.
Wait a second!
Yes, Iago?
I'll be along in a minute.
Excellent.
Give them a chance, Father.
Oh, I'll try, dearest.
After you, Your Highness.
All right, Carpet, let's go!
- Whoopee!
- Have a good time!
Hey, hey! Clear the way!
Make room for the picnic boys!
They already left, Genie.
Without us?
Without us?
No problem! I'll catch up in a flash!
Wait! Without me, too!
Aladdin needs some time alone with Father to patch things up.
You know what this means, monkey boy?
More food for us!
Oh, boy!
I'm sorry. Did you want some?
I'm... not hungry just now.
You two go ahead.
Come on, my boy!
Show me what this thing can really do!
That's the spot!
On top of the waterfall!
I'm losing my feathers here!
You're lucky you haven't lost more than that!
Oh, what fun!
Iago, I have to hand it to you.
This is a nice place.
It doesn't get any better than this, eh, Shaggy?
How about a nice drumstick?
This could use some secret herbs and spices.
Spiders?
Things could get ugly!
- Jafar!
- Uh-oh!
Sorry to spoil your picnic, boys... but I can't have any genies mucking about... ruining my plans.
Don't worry, Abu.
He's a genie, and genies can't kill anyone.
But you'd be surprised what you can live through.
You always were good for a laugh.
Oh, yeah?
Who's laughing now?
Why, I believe it's me.
I must admit
Your parlor tricks are amusing
I bet you've got a bunny under your hat
Now, here's your chance to get the best of me
Hope your hand is hot
Come on, clown, let's see what you've got
You can try to slam me with your hardest stuff
But your double whammy isn't up to snuff
I'll set the record straight
You're simply out of date, you're only second rate
You think your cat's a meanie
But your tiger's tame
You've got a lot to learn about the genie game
So for your education, I'll reiterate
You're only second rate
Men cower at the power in my pinky
My thumb is number one on every list
But if you're not convinced that I'm invincible
Put me to the test
I'd love to lay this rivalry to rest
Go ahead and zap me with the big surprise
Slap me in a trap, cut me down to size
I'll make a great escape, it's just a piece of cake
You're only second rate
You know, your hocus-pocus isn't tough enough
And your mumbo-jumbo doesn't measure up
Let me pontificate upon your sorry state
You're only second rate
Zaba-caba-dabra
Granny's gonna grab ya
Alakazam-Na-bus
This thing's bigger than the both of us
So spare me your tremendous scare
You look horrendous in your underwear
And I can hardly wait to discombobulate
I'll send ya back and packing in a shipping crate
You'll make a better living with a spinning plate
You're only second rate
Hello? Hello?
That was invigorating!
Come, Abis Mal... we have other lives to ruin.
Sultan...
Look, I'm sorry for not telling you about Iago.
I guess I saw some good in him... just like you saw some good in a street rat.
The good I saw in a...
Well, oh, yes, I... I suppose.
Well said, my boy!
Oh, you'll be a fine vizier!
This was a great idea, Iago. Thanks.
Oh, don't thank me. Really.
Sultan!
Abis Mal?
Aladdin!
You traitor!
Traitor is such a strong word.
Aladdin! Help!
I'll settle with you later.
Come on, Carpet!
Look, they're trapped on the cliff!
When they stop, we'll... What?
Abis Mal knows magic?
Whoa!
What? Get him! Get the sultan!
Hang on, Sultan!
This is where we lose them.
Sultan! We have to go back, Carpet!
Yes!
Huh?
What are you doing?
Are you nuts? You saved him!
He was this close... to being a greasy little smear on the rocks!
Look, you little...
I mean, my dear Abis Mal... if you remember the plan... it is not yet time for the boy to meet his end.
I knew that.
Soon, our revenge will be complete... and you shall have your third wish.
Ooh, my little wishy!
And you, Iago!
You have done well.
Please, don't mention it.
Sultan!
Iago.
Jafar, you fiend!
I should have known that this was your treachery!
But I couldn't have done it without Iago.
I played a minor role, really.
Jafar! This rug won't cooperate!
When Aladdin returns...
I think we have ample time to prepare for his arrival.
Hey! That was a nice hat.
I could have worn that hat!
We need this for our plan.
Couldn't we use another hat for the plan?
Oh, no. The sultan's turban and this dagger... are exactly what we need... to seal Aladdin's doom.
Razoul! The sultan's been...
Seize him! You are under arrest... for the murder of the sultan!
What? No!
And then you went over the waterfall, eh?
How did you survive?
I... I don't know.
How very convenient.
It's the truth!
Why won't you believe me?
Because we know you're lying!
- Huh?
- I found this in your room.
My father's turban... slashed!
- You can't think...
- I thought you loved me!
But now I see that all you wanted to do...
- was rule Agrabah!
- I never wanted...
He shall die at dawn for the murder of my father.
Jasmine, please!
You're in my hands now, street rat!
You should have seen the look on Aladdin's face... when Princess Jasmine sentenced him to death.
No!
Oh, yes! And then I get my wish.
Yes, and then you get your wish.
Iago! I swear one day you will pay for this!
I really think you're making too big a deal out of this.
Such spirit!
Perhaps after a few days in chains... you'll be more kindly disposed toward me.
Especially if you want your father to remain healthy!
Ah, Iago... you betrayed me and allied yourself with my enemies.
Then you turned on them... as soon as it was in your best interests.
That's what I love about you.
You're so perfectly predictable.
A villain through and through.
Thank you. Thank you.
Dawn!
I'll tell your boyfriend good-bye for you, Princess.
When I get hold of you, Jafar...
I'm so worried.
How could you double-cross Aladdin... after all he's done for you!
Hey, do I insult your mother?
What are you doing now?
Oh, what does it look like I'm doing?
I'm trying to free the chump genie... so he can save your chump boyfriend!
You have to lift it higher!
Sure. No problem.
- Wait!
- Jasmine!
I knew you wouldn't go through with this.
I just wanted to say good-bye, street rat.
Jafar! It's Jafar...
Thanks for saving me!
Oh, come on, Al. You know I had to.
That no-head look is just not you.
For my next trick, bibbidy bobbidy boo!
Oh-ho, and everybody's safe and sound.
Aladdin!
Aladdin!
Good to see you, too, Abu!
There's somebody else who wants to talk to you.
Hello.
You set me up!
How could you show your face?
You're nothing but a...
Aladdin, Iago rescued us.
He didn't have to, but he did.
Rescued? Him?
Please note...
"Did not have to, but did."
Now we should be fleeing for our lives... if you don't mind!
No! We have to stop Jafar!
But how? He's so powerful!
His lamp.
You destroy Jafar's lamp, you destroy Jafar.
Then that's what we'll do!
Reality check.
Jafar is large and in charge.
Yes. There's no telling what Jafar will do to Agrabah.
We have a responsibility!
Maybe you do, but I don't!
I'm only responsible for me, myself, and nobody!
I understand Iago. You've done enough.
And thanks!
Hey, I did my good deed!
I don't owe you a thing! You hear me!
Not a thing.
Now that my revenge is complete... there is one little matter left to resolve.
Yes! The wish!
Indeed.
You will now wish me free of this wretched lamp!
No! My wish!
You got what you wanted!
Now it's my turn!
But you don't need to waste your third wish.
You want the sunken treasure of Coeur Du Mer?
It's yours!
Yes, yes, yes!
Yes! I love it! I love it!
Silver! Lots and lots of it!
Oh, I'm so excited!
So this means I could have more stuff?
I always wanted one of those!
Nice! More! More!
Oh, dear!
Now, if it's obscenely excessive enough... perhaps you'd care to grant my freedom.
Huh? What? Oh, yeah, right.
Wish you were free. Sure thing, yeah.
I wish for Jafar to be...
Wait... how do I know that these things... won't disappear once I set you free?
The more pressing question is... how will you stay alive if you don't?
But you said genies can't kill!
You said that!
You'd be surprised what you can live through.
What?
Huh? Hey!
I'll take that!
My lamp! Gimme!
The street rat? Still alive? No!
Help!
Thanks, Genie!
Where's the lamp?
Aladdin!
Not so fast!
Give it up, Jafar!
We're obviously too much for you to handle!
You! You're a fool to challenge me!
I am all-powerful!
Some all-powerful.
You can't even get rid of a lowly street rat.
A problem I mean to rectify right now!
Aladdin!
- What?
- Gotcha!
Go, Al!
Genie!
Faster, Carpet!
Carpet, no!
Aladdin!
- Genie, wake up!
- Wake up!
Give it up, boy!
You shall never have my lamp... and there is no one to save you this time.
Hey, Jafar! Shut up!
Iago?
Traitor!
No!
Good help is so hard to find these days.
Isn't it, Aladdin?
My lamp!
Iago!
Oh, boy!
Iago...
No!
But I thought a genie couldn't kill anyone.
You'd be surprised what you can live through.
All right!
- Oh, boy!
- Oh, Iago!
He's alive!
And so the bird lived happily ever after... wallowing in luxury as Aladdin's palace pal.
Now, my dear boy... or should I say, my new vizier?
Oh, say it!
Sultan, I'm very honored, but...
But? What but?
"But" is such a strong word!
Why, I oughta...
I can't be your vizier.
What? Sultan, the boy's talking crazy talk!
Don't listen!
What more do you want?
The world.
Look, personally, I'm with you, kid... but let's take it one step at a time.
I mean... I want to see the world.
I can't just stay in the palace.
There's too much to do, too much to see.
Hey, what about your girlfriend?
Do you think that this lovely princess... is just going to wait around here?
I most certainly will not!
There, you see?
I'm going to see the world, too.
OK, that's it! The madness is spreading!
Crazy talk!
Why do I keep getting hooked up with these warped people?
Shouldn't somebody ask what the brave parrot wants to do?
Does this mean
I don't get my third wish?
Ripped by SkyFury
- Great game, dad.
- Thank you, my boy.
My goodness, the game night was something special.
Even better, because you invited me.
It's like I am a part of the family.
Good night together.
- Good night, Roy.
- Good night, Uncle Roy.
Good night.
8th
It's bedtime for you kids.
Wait a moment.
Nobody goes here until we all hugged each other.
A hug? Dad, are you alright?
I feel great.
Every now and then you just realize how happy you are.
Come on.
- OK.
- Press, press.
This feels so good,
I do not want to let go.
But off to bed.
- Peck. Good night.
- Sorry.
- Good night.
- Bye.
You seem so to have a really good mood.
And why not?
My life is good.
I have faithful friends, three loving children
- and a beautiful woman.
- Earl.
What else can you wish for?
Well, it's Thursday night.
And also time for us, going to bed.
I'll be right back, my dear.
I only clear the game and the dishes on.
Only takes a minute.
I'm waiting for you.
Who would have thought that?
I had so much fun today,
I did not even watch TV.
I could look for a few minutes.
What can that harm?
And now back to the rich.
Stanley, I hold do not turn off the tension.
What did you buy for my birthday?
You already admire it the last 37 kilometers.
- The lambswool seat cover?
- No, silly.
This huge piece of unspoiled coastline.
That's all yours, my dear.
Happy Birthday.
- My own shoreline.
- Yes.
I am so happy.
I do not have my own coastal strip.
Welcome to
The lifestyle of those we envy.
And we all envy the super rich male model Clive!
We met Clive in his lush
50-room amusement palace.
In Movieland Hills,
while bathing in his jeweled
Whirlpool filled with champagne.
Sorry, you happen to have very expensive mustard?
I have nothing of what they have.
How could I think
I would be happy?
I should see it.
There is a huge hole in my life, that I can never fill.
Fill the hole in your life with the Willi cup, the old sea bear.
A collector mug from world famous manufacturer Fernhill.
You certainly expect a high price for such handmade artwork.
And you're right.
He's terribly expensive.
But can you really live without him?
- No.
- Then call now!
- I will.
- Please be patient,
while we review your credit rating.
Only a select few are suitable for ownership
this masterpiece in limited quantities.
- Name?
- Earl Sinclair.
Hi?
Do not miss your chance, to the chosen ones.
To associate mug lovers, who found true happiness.
I would do everything for such a Fernhill mug.
Everything! I would...
I would even sell my soul!
Sulfur. I have to stop smoking.
Honey I'm home.
You. You are him. You are...
You are the one on the
"Devilish good ham".
Not long. They get a copyright lawsuit.
What do you want from me?
I happened to pass by and listened to something.
I could you get such a cup.
If you want.
Are you kidding?
I would give my soul.
Yes, yes, I heard that.
Of course you are aware of the seriousness of this trade?
Yes. I trade my immortal soul against one of these cups in the TV.
You captured it.
Where do I sign?
On the dotted line, please, and please draw on the pages with the slips against.
That looks so intimidating.
A pure standard contract,
I assure you.
Maybe that should be checked by a lawyer.
I am the king of lawyers!
Just sign!
I'm sorry.
I did not want to get angry.
It was a busy evening.
Every time this lifestyle broadcast
I have a lot to do
It was my pleasure, to serve you, Mr. Sinclair.
See you later.
Thanks.
Hey, wait! Where is my mug?
If you are the lord of darkness can not trust who then?
Man, that went fast.
No freight costs.
FRAGILE
We met Earl in his fabulous showcase home, where he has his extraordinary
Fernhill mug demonstrated.
Yes. Earl really seems to have everything.
He is finally on his way, to be really happy.
Yes.
I have never seen such a thing.
You have to be the luckiest person to be on earth.
My goodness. I wish I was you.
Of course I would have to to change my clothes
Would not be worthwhile.
But that is still a great-looking mug.
Yes, people.
Do you beat "luck" in the dictionary,
Do you see how I feel?
Yes.
Sinclair! Come in immediately!
What's the point, Sinclair?
I only give with mine new mug on.
Who said you can have such a thing?
If I'm not mistaken, sir, may I own things.
Well, I can not refuse you.
By legal means.
But we from the
Have a mug lover company strict standards for those who collect
Own or want to show cups.
You own a Fernhill mug?
A? I have eight!
Eight cups?
Sir, you have to be extremely happy.
I am the happiest you will ever meet
You worthless bucket full of fish food.
You can tell by her cheerful mood.
Flap!
Do you want to be a mug owner, you should behave like that too.
How do I start, sir?
First, keep away from the rabble far away, with which you spend time.
You mean my friends?
No more friends, Sinclair.
They are without cups and therefore not even worth the contempt.
Keep an eye on them, because they will be jealous and maybe you want to steal your mug.
Thanks for the warning.
Then you have to join our mug company.
Here.
Membership fee is 1,200 a year.
What? 1,200 dollars?
An alms, considering the hours great mug fellowship considering.
- We'll meet next week.
- I am invited to you?
Yes. While we light refreshments take, replace cup legends.
Buy, sell and trade and discuss articles in the mug magazine.
Cup magazine?
The monthly overview of Beverage Tube Collecting.
You have to subscribe.
But a bargain with 200 a year.
Sir, may I go now?
It seems, as if I had to spend a lot.
Yes.
Make room, he comes in.
What on earth is this?
- A Fernhill mug showcase.
- He looks expensive.
A necessary issue, to protect our investment.
- What investment?
- Our Fernhill mug.
Do you know that mug like mine have risen in value around...
My mug! Where is he!
Did you break it,
I'll tear your limbs out.
I did not touch him.
Earl, stop it.
Nobody broke anything.
After you left,
Roy came by and wanted to borrow him.
You owe me an apology.
Roy borrowed my mug?
Yes. He said, he wanted to impress a date with it.
You lent him to Roy?
He is rabble.
Mr. Richfield was right.
And now Willi is sitting in Roys shabby, small dump, while Roy and a cheap slut drooling on him and him in hers holding greasy little fingers.
Hi, Uncle Roy.
I have no greasy fingers.
The drool problem of my girlfriend is largely regulated.
- Here's your stupid mug.
- Woe, he's not okay.
We just looked at him.
And you have diminished its value.
What does this mean?
That collectible artwork like this not ignorant scum how you should be touched.
Earl, it's just a cup.
Do not be ridiculous, Fran.
You sound as stupid as Roy.
- What did you say?
- Fran, do not listen to him.
You are never as stupid as...
You can not talk to me or her talk about me like that.
I'm leaving, Mr. Former Old Boy.
And never come again.
- Bye.
- Finally got rid of.
You see mug TV.
Programs exclusively by, for, and about mug lovers.
And now the mug messages with chip stone.
Good evening.
Panic shook again tonight the mug community,
as another, more meaningless
Mug theft was reported.
The police advise all bucket owners,
their priceless collectibles good guard.
More Mug News in a minute.
Just courage.
And this activates the system.
You activate with your code
Alarm and security apparatus.
That's what keeps the thieves from to get my cup in her paws?
You mean, like that?
Do you see that?
And so disable it.
Yes. What do you say, Mr. S?
- Is it worth the money?
- Every last dollar.
We needed too.
Earl, we have to talk.
I was in the supermarket right now and they did not accept my check.
Something with insufficient coverage.
Fran, expensive alarm systems do not grow on trees.
I had to take the money somewhere.
Best of our bank account.
- What?
- Want to hear a cool alarm?
I want to know, how we should eat without money.
No fear.
We just earn something.
Mom, all my clothes has disappeared!
My sweaters, my blouses, my shoes. Everything.
My guitar is gone and my speakers.
Great alarm system, Earl.
Calm down all.
I know exactly where your stuff is.
I wanted anyway to check if everything is fine.
FLEA MARKET
Could you agree with the price go down this guitar?
No action. Prices as written.
- Can I help you, ma'am?
- Yes.
What does the baby chair cost?
He is not for sale.
Sixty dollars.
- The chair is not for sale.
- My goodness.
I give you two dollars for the blouse.
Listen, there is no flea market.
- You never would have...
- Pull yourself together, Fran.
Look how I deserve.
You're acting like a madman and destroy our family.
Are you kidding?
We earn extra money, only by being useless,
Declutter forgotten goods.
- These are my textbooks.
- My diary!
Come now.
We have to bring all sacrifices,
Let's stay a Fernhill family.
The cup!
The awful mug is the root of all the chaos.
You're in luck, you have an alarm system, otherwise I would run in and beat him down.
Fran. This mug, as you call it, made us happier than ever.
You're just too angry to see that.
Fran! Fran!
Bad mug.
Its getting late. Time to sleep.
Good night, Willi.
- We are up, you should need us.
- Of course, Mr. S.
CUP SECURITY ABSTRACT
Dino baby powder
Caught.
Wake up!
- What happened?
- Something is going on.
I'm here for you, Mr. S.
My goodness. It is the baby!
It was not me, I tell you.
If you do something to the cup, so help me...
Earl. Take action against the noise!
Immediately, ma'am.
OK.
- Honey, are you alright?
- I'm fine, mom.
Give me the cup.
You little rat.
I should you Skinning alive.
- Looks like the work of insiders.
- It's ok, hank.
He was it. Lock him up and throw the key away.
Earl, this is our child.
Okay, keep the key.
Mr. S., will you file a claim?
Not necessary.
- I take the child with me.
- Can you have him.
More precisely, we will all go, until my husband comes to his senses again.
- Yes.
- All right, go.
Take the children with you.
The types in the lifestyle series marry constantly new!
But they keep their villas and sports cars and Fernhills.
Who is this?
Nobody gets my cup.
I'm here, to protect him. Nobody.
Nobody...
They are all after me.
They are after me.
Tomorrow, Mr. S. Another quiet night?
You can sleep peacefully, the cup is still safe.
That's true. That's the important thing.
Until this evening.
It was here last night really quiet, right?
Yes, sir.
And our alarm system did her job, right?
Sir, if it does not bother you,
I really want to be with my family.
You have a family?
Yes, sir. Wife and children.
Do you have pictures?
Yes, many pictures.
I bet they still like you.
Yes, I think I am the happiest person in the world.
- Yes.
- I do not have much, but I have her love.
In my view that is enough to be happy.
I have a picture of my mug.
Loopy.
I lost my friends,
I lost my family.
I even lost Hank.
I'm sorry, Willi, but I am not happy.
Sulfur. Pooh.
Ok, Sinclair. Ready to take off?
What does this mean? I'm not dead.
Why are you hanging around?
For this exciting fun?
No, I think,
I made a terrible mistake.
I've never heard that before.
I'm not ready to go.
I made a mistake.
Well, forget it. We have a deal.
Pretty expensive.
You cost me everything.
Can I take this?
Sure, a carry-on bag is allowed.
Why do you want the cup?
As a constant painful memory the stupidity of my actions.
I like it. Très symbolic.
I'll just get the box quickly.
He should on the crossing nothing happens.
Good, but hurry up.
I have a lot to do.
- What's this?
- Are you finally going now?
A moment.
- Here is a manufacturer's warranty.
- I beg your pardon?
A legal document that says if I am not completely satisfied, I can return the cup for up to seven working days send and get everything refunded.
Let me see that.
Let's see... That's a guarantee...
Seven days?
Full refund?
Damn it.
I am not satisfied.
I want to have my family back.
You are me this time jumped off the shovel, Sinclair.
Everything that was done was not done.
Bye for now!
Hey, wait a minute. What is...
We met Clive in his lush
50-room amusement palace.
In Movieland Hills,
while bathing in his jeweled
Whirlpool filled with champagne.
Earl, are you going to bed?
Sweetheart, Thursday night, you know what?
- You're right, that's it.
- Exactly.
It still is Thursday evening and I do not have
Family and friends scorned, because of a ridiculous piece of property.
No, Earl, you do not have.
Do not go away.
We'll be right back.
With much more to envy, after these dazzling commercials.
No, not really.
I'm coming, darling.
The Swan Princess
Once upon a time,
There was a King named William.
Who ruled a large and mighty Kingdom, and yet he was sad.
He was growing old and had no child to inherit the thrown.
Then happily, a daughter was born, a Princess.
And she was given the name Odette.
Kings and Queens came from all around to offer the gifts to the child.
Among them was the widow Uberta and her young son Prince Derek.
It was then that William and Uberta had upon the same idea.
Derek and Odette will be brought together each summer, in hopes that they will fall in love,
And join their Kingdoms forever.
But unknown to all was another plan, that of the evil enchanter Rothbart.
Odette birth was of little concern to him, for he was prepearing to take William's Kingdom, by means of the 'forbidden arts'.
On the eve of his assault,
William attacked and Rothbart's power was plunged into darkness.
Despite calls for his death, the enchanter was only banished.
I'm not finnished with you yet, Willi.
Someday I'll get my power back, and when I'll do, everything you own, everything you love, will be mine!
Many feared King William too kind, but in time, the threat was forgotten, and all hopes turned to that not so distant summer,
When Derek and Odette would meet.
Here they come.
Dear Uberta, and lovely as ever.
Oh, a nest.
Ah, and who is this terrific young man be?
Young prince Derek, no doubt.
Welcome to our fair Kingdom dear
William, and to you, young Princess.
Go on, Derek!
Dear, go on!
-Mother! -Derek!
Hello Princess Odette,
I'm very pleased to meet you.
Pleased to meet you, Prince Derek.
Ha-ha-ha-haa.
Yach.
I can’t believe I’m stuck with her all summer,
I’ll bet, she doesn’t wrestle, hunt or box.
He looks conceited,
What a total bummer.
If I get lucky, I’ll get chicken pox.
So happy you could come.
So happy to be here.
How I’d like to run.
This is not my idea.
This isn’t my idea,
Of fun.
The children seem to get along quite nicely.
We’ll join our lands if this arrangement clicks.
My dear King William, that’s my point precisely.
It’s such good parenting
And politics.
So happy we agree.
I think we’ve got a deal.
Derek’s quite a catch.
This is my idea.
This is my idea,
Of a match.
They such naughty.
Good heavens, child, don’t dawdle,
We can’t keep Derek waiting.
I haven't packed or washed my hair
And father I get seasick.
She soon will be arriving,
Is that respect you're showing?
To make me kiss her hand again,
I swear I'm gonna be sick.
One day Prince Derek will be her intended.
Splendid!
We've tried all summer, but we just can't lose her.
Hey fellas, wait up!
Quick, put on some speed.
When picking teams
Or friends,
I never choose her.
You'd think she'd take a hint? a learn to read?
This really isn't fair.
We really couldn't care.
Boys, it's all or none.
This is not my idea.
This isn't my idea,
Of fun.
Long before they met,
Derek and Odette,
Were destined to be wedded.
However anyone could see,
The only point on which they didn't disagree,
Was that the very thought of summertime,
Was dreaded.
She tries to talk me into playing dress-up,
She's always flirting with the castle guards.
I think you really sorta like her, 'fess up.
I'd like her better if she'd lose at cards,
-Four sevens and a ten.
I think I've won again.
Every time she's won.
This is my idea.
This isn't my idea,
Of fun.
We need a royal wedding.
I'd love to be invited.
At least we'd get a holiday, to rest our ploughs and axes.
Someday these two will marry,
Two lands will be united,
And with some luck their marriage, may result in lower taxes.
What if Odette doesn't go for the merger?
Urge her!
For as long as I remember,
We've been told we'd someday wed,
Every June until September.
All their pushing and annoying hints.
I've got bruises with their fingerprints.
I can do much better I am sure.
He's so immature.
I see him smiling and my knees start buckling,
I see inside him and my doubts are gone.
She started out as such an ugly duckling,
And somehow suddenly became a swan.
So happy to be here.
'Til now I never knew.
It is you I've been dreaming of.
This is my idea.
This is my idea.
What a good idea, such a charming and romantic notion.
This is my idea.
-This is my idea.
Such a good idea.
-Such a good idea.
What a good idea, such a powerful and magic potion.
This is exactly my idea,
Of love.
This is my idea.
This is my idea.
This is my idea,
Of love.
Arrange the marriage.
Wait!
What?
You are all, I ever wanted.
You're beautiful.
Thank you, but what else?
What else?
Is beauty all that matters to you?
Derek!
What else?
I... what else is there?
-Ahh.
We tried, Uberta.
No one can say, we didn't try.
Say goodbye, Odette.
Good bye. -Good byeeee?
-Prince Derek.
Mother!
-Derek!
Good bye, Princess.
All these years of planning,
Waisted!
"What else is there"?
She says
"Is beauty all that matters"?
And you say "what else is there"?
It was dumb, I know.
You should write a book,
How to offend women in five syllables or less.
Your turn, Prince Derek.
I did not know what else to say.
You lost your Queen, Derek.
It's twice in one day.
Think! You must see something other than Odette's beauty.
Ha, Of course I do Rogers.
She's like... you know...
How about... and then,
I mean right?
I don't know how to say it.
I'll prove it to her.
I'll prove my love.
Checkmate!
Today is the day, Willy!
Everything you own!
Everything you love!
Will be mine!
I... I just don't understand.
What else did you want him to say?
I need to know that he loves me.
For just being me.
Stay inside, Odette.
It's King's William Captain.
We...
We were attacked.
A great animal...
Odette?
Derek! Wait!
Odette!
Odette?
Odette!
King William.
Derek.
Who did it?
It came so quickly...
A great... animal.
Where is Odette?
Listen to me, Derek.
It's not what it seems...
It's not what it seems...
What's not?
Where is Odette?
Odette, is...
Odette, is... gone.
Odette!
Don't let my little spell make you sad, Odette.
It does not even last the whole day.
As soon as the moon comes up...
And that's how it works, every night.
You have to be on the lake of course, and when the moonlight touches your wings...
Look Odette.
This sort of thing does not give me any pleasure.
Well, maybe a little bit...
But what I really want is... is your father's Kingdom.
Take it than, you have enough power.
Naaa, tried that already.
Once you steal something, you spend your whole life fighting to keep it.
But... If I marry you... and to the throne...
We'll rule your father's Kingdom together, legally.
King and Queen.
You know...
-Never!
Where are you going?
As soon as moonlight leaves the lake, You turn back into the swan.
No matter where you are.
The musicians are not happy.
I know, but I have to practice.
No, no complains here.
I think, it's going to be lots of fun.
The Great animal's never going to give up without a fight.
You are still thinking, she is alive?
When I'll find the Great animal,
Rogers, I'll find Odette.
Oh, Derek,
You looked everywhere.
She is not coming back.
The whole Kingdom knows that.
The whole Kingdom is wrong
Odette's alive.
And I get to find her.
You ready, Brom?
-No peeking!
Animals! Assemble!
Lord Rogers, I must object.
We are musicians.
The servants have the day off.
We have to use someone.
But I am an artist, not a boar.
Could've fooled me.
Come on, guys.
They harmless.
We are a band,
And not a band of animals.
This masquerade,
Is more than I can bear.
There goes my reputation,
It's awful, this humiliation.
And I've the lion's share.
Down on all fours, please and growl ferociously.
Liven it up a bit!
I want you to strike fear into my heart.
Not You, Wesley, you're a rabbit,
For heaven's sake.
Archers!  Ready!  Set! Go!
Duck!
Yes!
Duck!
What?
Day after day all the prince ever does,
Is practice, practice, practice.
Thinking of her and the way that it was.
Practice, practice, practice.
He's not happy, 'til he has attacked us.
Twelve seconds.
Day after day all the prince ever does.
Is practice, practice, practice.
Thinking of her and the way that it was.
Practice, practice, practice.
If we refused he would have sacked us. -Five seconds.
So we face a life of target.
Three, Two.
Practice, practice, practice.
Time's up!
Animals, assemble for counting.
Ha-ha, very good, very good.
Your scored, thank you, five pointers.
That's for sure.
Sorry Hans, why don't you take few days off.
Moose are worth 2 points.
Sixteen Hits a total of 32.
Ten 7 points.
And... Fourteen 3 Points.
A total of 298.
Well done! Derek.
Now, Bromley, let's see if you...
Hmm... zero and zero and a nothing and nil and zip.
And last but not least, the elusive one hundred points.
White rabbit.
I belive that's three hundreds Rogers.
Good shooting Brom.
Well what it tell?
300 into 298.
Oh, but a wait just a moment Rogers.
Sorry Brom.
Ha-ha-ha-hmm.
You are a great archer, one of the best.
But it's gets more than good aim, in types courage, thats why they for there.
Well, then how about quick round of catch and fire.
Ca-Ca-Ca-Catch and fire.
You mean me.
You are the only one with enough,
Co-Co-Co-Courage.
Whoooo ho.
Are you sure you are alright?
Hmm quiet I'm I'm fine.
Ho-hooo. Too tied, too tied.
Whoops, so sorry...
Ready? -He is ready.
Remember now, aim to the heart.
Right between the shoulders.
Oh please, so please.
Come on, Brom, hold it steady.
Oh please, oh please, oh please.
Now!
Fifty two out of fifty two.
Well done, Derek.
Extraordinary couragement,
Just think, one inch lower.
And that arrow would have...
Don't loose hope, Odette,
Wherever you are,
I'm going to find you.
Quiet, I can not concentrate.
You've come up with some dumb ideas Jean Bob.
But this one is a dozy.
Go ahead and laugh.
I'll get her to kiss me and when she does...
And when she does... poof, you'll change into a prince.
I know, I know, you've told me.
Why don't you just give her these flowers?
These are pretty.
Ahh, what a love dance,
I don't want these flowers,
I must of those.
When she learns that I have risked my life for them, then her kissing will not stop.
And then you'll change into a prince.
Precisely.
Mind if I point up a problem.
I don't take advise from peasants.
Suit yourself.
Flower, Kiss, concentration.
Flower, Kiss, concentration.
Just curious, how you gonna get back?
Hurry! Hurry!
Move up! Move up!
Faster! Claude.
Grab me, grab me.
Hold my arm, hold my leg.
Hold my...
Hold it, hold it, hold it.
Oh, thank you Odette.
Thank you, let me have that.
Silence! you savages.
Oh, Are you alright Jean Bob?
Jean Bob?
Oui, Oui.
Oui, Odette, yes, I am alright.
What the whole world, do you tring to do.
He thought that if...
-shosh...
I wanted to get those flowers for you.
You are being sneaky again, Jean Bob!
What sneaky?
You deserve it, not? OK?
And you deserve a kiss?
Well, alright.
You know that, I am under a spell.
But my kiss will break the spell.
Give it up Jean Bob.
I can only kiss the man I love
And then he...
Must make a vow of everlasting love I know.
And prove it to the world.
What do you think,
I was doing with the flowers, in the alligators going jam jam?
Speed, make him understand.
I am only a turtle.
If I could break this spell,
I'd run to him today.
And somehow I know he's on his way to me.
Derek, you and I were meant to be.
Far longer than forever.
I'll hold you in my heart.
It's almost like you're here with me.
Although we're far apart.
Far longer than forever.
As constant as a star.
I close my eyes and
I am where you are.
Sure as the dawn brings the sunrise.
We've an unshakable bond.
Destined to last for a lifetime and beyond.
Far longer than forever.
-Far longer than forever.
I swear that I'll be true.
-I swear that I'll be true.
I've made an everlasting vow.
To find a way to you.
Far longer than forever.
Like no love every known.
And with your love
I'll never be alone.
Far longer than forever.
Much stronger than forever.
And with your love
I'll never be alone.
You think, he is dead?
No, it just his wing, I think.
Strange looking bird.
Uhhhh...
Uh my, fellow, you must be in a lot of pain.
You better hold him.
Uh...
-Ready.
Uhhhh... hhha.
Hello!
This is your wake up time.
It takes more than a pair of dumb fools to keep Puffin down.
Wait! Wait!
I-I am your friend.
If you are my friend, how come you have an arrow in you hand?
Haa? Haa? Yes!
The exact arrow I have?
Hmm... Haaa.
I took it out when you were laying there.
You mean, you had a chance to... kill... but still you free...
Ahaa.

Lieutenant Puffin.
It's a pleasure, Lieutenant Puffin.

Princess Odette.
And these are my best friends in the whole world.
Mr. Lorenzo Trudge-Along.
Friends call me speed.
-And Jean Bob.
I have no friends, only servants and zey call me, "Your Highness".
He thinks, he is a Prince.
I owe you, princess,
And I intend on staying until we get his paid.
I don't think there is much you can do.
He has my under a spell.
What! You mean a magical who... who-ho-ho-ho.
Your Knight in shining armor, has come to set you free!
Let me ask him, let me ask him...
Enough... enough.
All it takes is just one little word.
Will you... marry me?
Every night you ask the same question.
No! No!
And every night I give you the same answer.
Don't!
I'll die first.
Really start to bug me.
I think, you be used to it by now.
Thats it!
Yours kept push it!
But some day I'm gonna boil over!
Go head then!
But I'll never give you my fathers Kingdom!
I knew it.
I was hoping, you would say "You'll be mine".
Well, it looks as if you need another day.
Just think about it.
No!
Princess!
Beautiful! Simply beautiful!
Soon Derek will be married,
And the Kingdom will have a King again.
I doubt it.
Derek still refuses to be King,
Unless he finds Odette.
Oh... puppy pup, All that will change at tomorrow nights ball.
They all coming to the ball.
Every princess is coming.
Oh my... Oh good... Oh my... this is wonderful.
You see, Rogers?
One of these is bound to change his mind.
Oh! Absolutely... Not!

Oh no, no, no, no.
Where is Derek? Oh, never mind,
I know where he is.
Working on the mystery of the fat animal.
The great animal, Your Highness.
Oh, make great it's much better.
Listen, Derek, its not what it seems.

To find the great animal.
Oh! wonderful.

Oh, Thank you darling.
Please mother, don't turn it into one of your beauty pageants.
Hooo... no no no no no,

And their daughters.
I want this to be big.
Every princess that ever own production.
But You said...
Forget what I said.
Now, send for the cooks
And tell the band to start rehearsing
And I want four footmen for every carriage.
Make it five.
Let me get this straight.
You mean...
Every night when the moonlight leaves the lake,
You...
Right.
The following night, if I wanted turn back into a human,
I have to be on the lake.
What she needs is a little moon light.
Me, I after be smooched.
No fear!
You fly to your prince.
We bring him back to the lake.
The moon comes up.
You change into a princess.
And... happily ever after.
How am I find him?
You don't know where he is?
I even don't know where I am.
I bet, he does.
Oh, such a great idea.
Just say "Monsieur Rothbart",
I'd like to leave now, you have a map or something.
That's it!
A map!
Let's do it!
We’re off on a mission.
We’re tough, in good condition.
We're short.
But standing tall.
No fear!
There's danger around us.
They'd hurt us if they found us.
Our backs are to the wall.
No fear!
‘Cause we have all the courage we require.
Take it from a frequent flyer.
Try your luck.
Our plan will fly.
No fear!
It's hanging on the wall.
In the upper chamber.
Odette will keep looking after him,
While we get the map.
We?
Would you not go to help us?
Oui.
This plan if applied’ll.
Be simply suicidal.
You’ll be a sitting duck.
No fear!
Suppose that I do this.
Who knows if we’ll live through this?
How ‘bout a kiss for luck?
No,
-Fear!
Our team is shy one green, web-footed volunteer.
No way, Jose.
No chance!
No choice.
No fear!
No! stop it! stop it! No!
Alright! Quickly!
Easy for you to say.
Ahooch...
Why ever I have to do something?
Quick!
I always bring a turtle.
I think I pull a muscle.
I'm gonna die!
Out of it, I am going a dangerous mission with a labor turtle!
You're gonna get us, all kill.
Be careful.
We will take any dare that the other side’ll dare to dream up.
We’ll fight tough we’ll play fair.
But we’re sure to win because we’ll team up.
Yaahics...
Hit for the door.
Alright! Jean bob go speed,
Speed gets the hands off.
Ready!
-Ready.
Set!
I'm open, I'm open.
What?
Catch that map.
Saved you.
Reach.
Hey! better better bet.
All The crowd...
No fear!
She’s gaining!
She’s faster!
We’re heading for disaster!
Our hero, warts and all!
No fear!
I would be fine if one of us knew how to steer!
Get a grip!
Get set.
That’s our respect!
No breaks!
No sweat.
And no regrets!
We’re dead!
Not yet.
Oh no, not there!
Save me.
No fear!
There is Derek's Kingdom.
When do we leave?
It's a mouse.
A great animal.
That's small one, I'd say.
Yeah, Until it changes into this...
An animal that can change it's shape.
A harmless creature approaches.
Then, suddenly it's too late.
You mean, you mean it could be anything?
Anything.
Odette, I appologise for the way I have been acting.
It's alright Jean Bob.
No, no, this Derek is very important to you.
And all I can do, is think of myself.
Every one does that.
Please, Odette, don't make it more difficult, than it all ready is.
Accept my appology, please.
OK, I accept.
Good, now we can kiss and make up.
Jean Bob!
What did I say, what? What?
The thing...
It is "zero hour", troops.
Odette, prepare for take off.
Right.
The rest, do you have your assignments?
Is everyone ready?
Ready for action, sir.
How about you, Jean Bob?
Jean Bob!
... Highness.
Oui, I am... ready.
Take off!
Good luck.
Have a nice flight.
Remember!
If anything happens to her,
I'll have you whipped, flogged, put on ze rack and your back legs fried in butter.
He is in here, Brom.
I can feel it.
Oh, You know the great animal, when you see it...
Oh, no.
Better stay close.
If you say so.
Derek... Derek!
Where are you?
Shh... shh...
Oh, sorry.
Derek?
Derek!
We'll better keep an eye for hunters.
Ease Odette,
I can smell a human, a mile away.
Would a duck.
Derek!
He is here!
What the... You will not lose control!
You will follow the plan.
Its our line.
Acknowledge, acknowle...
Odette!
Odette?
No! I've got you now! Oh-Oh, Oh-Oh.
Don't give with that innocent look.
Oh-Oh, charge!
Go a head, charge!
No, I am not afraid of you!
Twit! Nooooo...
Ahh, Derek!
A Swan?
A Swan!
Of course!
It's not what it seems.
Just a little closer.
Come on!
Come on!
Derek...
This one is for Odette!
Uhh, look out!
Uhh, Uhh, Uhh, that was close.
Ha Ha, It's working, here he comes.
Hey, slow down, you're going to lose him.
Slowww dowww.
He is too close.
-Too close?
He can't even see us any more. let's...
Stay up now.
Ho, your boy know how to move.
-I told you.
He is faster than you thought.
Don't worry, Odette.
I even thought, just what to do in this situation.
Well?
-When... -Puffin!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
When you're too isolated.
Fly into the sun and use it's light. Follow me.
Ha ha! Well, what did
I tell you Odette?
Yes, now you see! all we have to do is just stay in. So?
Ha, Alright!
Don't panic! Don't panic!
Puffin! -Odette, hurry.
-Into the trees!
You'll better think of something quick.
Or else, we're "The Ducks".
How about, shooting the number that poison, said?
When there's no escape.
You have to play dead.
It give you the right touch.
Wait till I get, give up. Ha.
That will put some distance between us.
No sign of them yet.
I hope that Pigeon, Puffin, knows what he is doing.
Incoming.
Ha, ha, there they are.
It's almost time, Odette. Look!
I... I cant do it.
-But you have to.
He'll kill me, Puffin!
You don't do it now, Odette,
You've lost your chance for life.
Alright.
I'll do it.
-Go!
What?
Alright! Come on! Come on!
Got you!
Hello Derek.
Derek, I missed you so.
No one believed me.
But I knew...
-You can't stay.
Can't stay?
No, I'll never let you out of my sight again.
Listen to me, Derek.
Odette!
-Oh, no!
Who is it? What's going on?
It's him! -Who?
He has me under a spell.
Who does?
Odette!
Let him come! I'm...
No! He has great power.
You must go!
You are coming with me.
I can't.
When the moon sets,
I turn back into a swan.
Please Derek, you have to trust me.
Go!
There must be someway to break the spell.
Oh, there is.
You must make a vow of everlasting love.
I'll make it.
It's all I ever wanted.
You must prove it to the world.
How? How?
I don't know...
-Odette!
Go!
The ball! Tomorrow night.
Come to the castle.
Before the whole world,
I will make a vow.
Of everlasting love.
Odette!
I'm coming.
Go!
-Tomorrow night.
Yes, tomorrow night.
Go.
Odette!
Didn't you hear me calling?
I... I... I...
I thought, I heared voices?
Odette, Odette.
Voices?
-Yes. Voices!
Well, I...
-You what?
I decided to become your Queen.
No! You mean...
Oh! Odette...
Odette, you make me so happy
I'll be a good King. You'll see.
I'll wear nice clothes and I'm going to clip my beard.
Shit, Oh... you... you made me so happy.
Oh, by the way!
You would't happen to know, what's this belongs to?
Would you?
"Come to the ball, I will make a vow".
"An everlasting love"!
Thought, you could fool Rothbart?
Did you?
I will never be yours!
You creature!
I will marry Prince Derek, and you can not stop me!
I hate to tell you this, Odette.
But you wan't be able to attend the big ball tomorrow night.
If you want to stop me, you'll have to kill me!
No! I don't think so.
You see, you forgot one very important thing.
Tomorrow night... there is no moon.
No matter what they do,
I always one step ahead.
On the other hand, Prince Derek's vow could ruin everything.
I'll gonna have to deal with him.
But how?
I am going to turn his vow to the wrong princess.
That's it.
I'll make you look like Odette.
That's gonna take a lot of work.
But it will be worth it.
Because when he makes his vow to the wrong girl,
Odette will die!
And I'll finish Derek off myself.
Oh, I love it.
I mean, this is really classic.
This is me!
Gosh, it's such a hoot to see them quaking.
When I'm King they'll treat me with respect.
I can't wait to watch their poor hearts breaking.
So much for politically correct.
Up 'til now I've pulled my punches.
I intend to eat their lunches.
No more Mr. Nice Guy, not for me.
If you think that I'm hard-hearted.
Well, let me by,
I haven't even started.
No more Mr. Nice Guy, no siree.
Soon as my witchcraft has zinged them.
I'll gain control of the Kingdom.
As for Odette, well that's tragic.
'Cause I'm going back to that old black magic.
Good behaviour is so much duller.
Time to show my one true colour.
Baby, Mr. Nice Guy's history.
Vengeance is what I believe in.
I don't get mad, I get even.
Odette can't get to the ball
'cause I won't bring her.
So I'll zap up a date who's a real dead ringer.
Up to no good, I love plottin'.
'Cause I'm so good when I'm rotten.
No more Mr. Nice Guy, wait and see. -wait and see.
I'll become that nasty, naughty, very spiteful.
Wicked, wayward, way delightful.
Bad guy I was born to be.
One more time.
Lying, loathsame, never tender.
Indiscreet repeat offender.
No more Mr. Nice Guy, that's not me.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Mother, have you seen...
Hello Derek.
What are these?
-Roses.
Red.
-Of course they're red.
But maam...I don't want red roses.
I want white, like a swan.
You seen Bromley? -No.
Has anyone seen Bromley?
Woul'd you feed this to a swan?
I...
Take it back.
Something light.
Something fresh.
No no no no no, Rogers, hold it.
Whats wrong?
Tonight the music must be played... Rubato.
Soft and graceful... like a swan.
A swan?
-You ever seen a swan, Rogers?
Of course I seen a swan!
If you could play a swan, what would it sound like?
Soft and graceful, Rogers.
Where is Bromley?
No one has seen him, Derek.
You kidding. Who is gonna be my best man?
Best... You mean... You...
Oh Derek, Ohhh Derek.
There you go Rogers, thats the style.
Came on, Mother.
Oh, don't be so secretive, Derek.
Tell me, who she is?
It hurts me to lock you up, Odette.
Hurts me... deep.
But then, a King this day is full of tough decisions.
You understand?
Oh, now you mad at me again, damn. Got it!
I can't do nothing right.
Head full of put on. Thats me.
Well, I can't leave you like this.
If you not happy,
I'm not happy.
I know. If you can't attend the ball, than I'll bring the ball to you.
Let see. The first thing, you need is, a young man.
The Prince is busy of course, but...
I think, I can arrange a substitution.
No, please,
I beg you, please.
Ohh, Poor fellow.
He got lost in the woods.
Oh, help... help!
Don't go.
I love to stay but if I don't leave now, I'll be late. That's that.
Don't give me that look, you see.
Had to be sneaky.
Didn't you.
Had to drag your weakling
Prince into. Didn't you.
It's fine with me.
Just fine with me!
Every single princess on the planet.
Prayed to be invited to the ball.
Every Portia, Guinevere and Janet.
Would come by coach or boat to be here.
Most would swim the moat to be here.
Just to be at this historic gala.
Girls would walk around or even crawl.
Rumour is that at this joyous scene tonight.
The prince will likely choose his future Queen tonight.
Excuse me.
Oh, excuse me.
Excuse me, Your Highness.
Yes, yes, Chamberlain.
Its getting rather crowded.
Very well, you may begin the introductions.
And Chamberlain...
-Yes...
No mistakes this time.
Every thing must be perfect.
Oh, oh no no, oh yes,
I mean, oh no no, Madam.
Everything will be perfect.
Promise me, Derek, you'll tell me who it is the moment she arrives.
Don't worry, mother.
You'll know. Believe me.
You'll know.
Ah! -What?
-It comes.
What is...
-An idea!
A substantial idea.
A large colossal idea.
Sounds big.
-I've got it.
Water leaks into the dungeon.
Right?
Well, if there's a leak, there must be a hole.
We'll find the hole, make it bigger, and... she is loose.
I think, you forgetting two things.
His majesty has got a point.
Not to worry!
Now, first we need a scout.
Are you crazy?
Who's going to jump into this moat?
He's got to be a good swimmer.
I should say so.
He's got to be small too.
Tinny winny. Not to be seen.
And it wouldn't hurt if he was green for camouflage purposes.
Precisely.
Small, good swimmer, Green.
Good grief, you talking about me?
You’re off on a mission.
-Not, definetly not!
You’re tough, in good condition.
-I can't hear you.
Our hero, warts and all!
-I can't hear you.
No fear!
-I can't hear you.
Thank you, oh thank you, now...
I know that some of you jest at all beauty pageants.
But I have been a past past girl myself win back in 39.
I just couldn't resist, girls, and one, a two, a one two three.
Beauty and glamour and breeding unmatched.
Princess is on parade.
Lovely, enthralling and all unattached.
The hoi polloi and those well-bred agree.
Each enjoy a royal pedigree.
Born for success, each possesses a spark.
Each a remarkable maid.
Boy, oh boy, these royal highnesses.
Those all have pluses, they've no minuses.
Gaze upon.
Princess is on parade.
This princess comes from Caulchester.
Where corn and cotton grows.
She plays crockey and art supports and sews her own clothes.
Antonia isn't known to take the part of least resistance.
She held from southeast Pakistan and came the farther distance.
Grizelle lives to help the world.
She finds no task to anyone. and all the other hopeful girls, think she is the most con genuine.
Brunhelda is from Shtutgart where swords and armour maid.
Gaze upon.
Princess is on parade.
This is the likely occasion,
When the heir to the throne picks a wife.
This is may be the day when Prince Derek will say.
“Where have you been all my life?"
Brilliant, beguiling, the smiling brigade.
Princess is on parade.
Each the pride of her community.
Each a golden opportunity.
Just the thought that crown Prince Derek'll.
Face his choice and he's hysterical.
Gaze upon.
Heap praise upon. he is bigger, glamorous, luminous, dazzling.
Princess is on Parade.
Chamberline.
Oh, who are invited are present? are they not?
Well, yes, I mean... well...
Open the door!
Chamberlain.
Possibly it can't, my list...
This the milkman... it must be the milkman.
Well, it's not the milkman.
Oh, oh no, it can't be...
Excusse me, pardon me, please, please, I've got to get through here.
Oh,oh yes, she is lovely.
Isn't? hmm...
Queen coming through here, excuse me, excuse me.
Rogers, Rogers! Who is it?
Do you know her?
I don't know.
Come on, Rogers, I know he confides in you, who is it?
I promise,
I've never seen her before.
Although she does look a great deal, like...
It couldn't be...
Could it?
Oh, I was so worried.
I almost thought.
Nothing keep me away.
OK. Speed will draw the alligators away.
Then you'll get wind and start and pick up... for that hole.
If I can find it and if the alligators don't chew me.
Before I get there.
They can't worry.
Speed will rush to help.
Ah, Yes Mister!
Oh, lassies will rush to help.
That's the plan.
Suddenly I'm full of comfort.
Than alright. Stretch out.
How do I get myself talk into this?
Oh, it's alright, use your mark.
Hey, you all leather hands.
Come and get me.
Come on Bug eyes.
Ah ah, perfect, perfect, Right.
Ready! Get set! Go!
Faster! Faster!
Sure, go on Jean Bob, right to your death.
Get moving, slowpoke!
Slowpoke?
Na na, na na, na na, na na.
Any luck?
Jean Bob?
To the rescue, Mademoiselle.
There's the signal.
Alright, Puffin. Time to brush up on a diving technic.
You ho!
Those turtles are tough eaten.
How about a good white meat?
Good for the heart.
We broke through!
Let's go!
Thank you Jean Bob.
Oh, and when this is over, remind me to give you a kiss.
What? What is it?
Stay away! What are you doing?
No! No! Go away!
I'll tell you when.
Let's go!
Friends call me speed.
Go Odette! Go!
Something about you, seems...
I don't know... different.
Don't worry, after tonight everything will be perfect.
Yes, yes of course.
Rogers, I want to make an announcement.
Stop the music!
Kings and Queens, ladies and gentelmen, mother.
I have an announcement to make.
Today I have found my bride.
No Derek! No! It is a trick!
Presenting to you as the future Queen of our Kingdom.
And as proof of my love for her,
I make a vow to break all vows.
A vow stronger than all the powers of the earth.
Before you and before the whole world,
I make a vow of everlasting love.
Derek!
To Odette.
Noooooo!
No more Mr. Nice Guy, no siree.
Hello little Prince.
Who are you?
Went and pledged your love to another?
What are you talking about?
This is Odette!
No! Odette is mine!
It's you!
You have no power here!
I made a vow!
A vow of everlasting love!
You made a vow alright!
A vow of everlasting death!
No! Odette!
You should have left her to me.
Now, Odette will die.
Odette!
Odette.
She's fading fast, little prince.
-No!
Gosh, something goes wrong.
If you hurry, little Prince,
I'll let you see her one last time! -Go!
There she is.
I don't think she's gonna make it.
Ease fly, Odette. Ok, good girl.
Come on now.
Odette.
Oh, what have I done to you.
Forgive me Odette, forgive me.
Derek...
-Yes Odette...
I'm here
-Derek, I feel so weak.
I think, I am...
No! You'll live Odette!
The vow I made was for you!
I know. I love you Derek.
Odette, Odette, Odette!
I made The vow for her!
Do you hear?
The vow I made was for her!
No need to shout.
Don't let her die!
Is that a threat?
Don't you dare let her die!
Oh, it is a threat.
You're the only one with the power! Now do it!
Only if you defeat... me!
The great animal!
I bet on the animal.
Noooooo!
I won't let her die!
The bow, Derek's bow!
Swim to the bottom of the lake and get the bow.
Throw it, out! Throw it!
Throw it! Yeah...
Wake up, wake up, hallo
Good luck.
Oh, please... -Brom.
-Oh please, oh please, Nooo...
Forgive me Odette.
Forgive me.
I only wanted to break the spell.
To prove my love.
I love you. You're kindness and courage, I always have.
Derek?
-Odette?
Oh, Derek!
Well, there you have it, everlasting love.
Well, Rogers, old man.
I suppose you owe me an appology.
After all, if it weren't for me.
The great animal would still be live.
No... -what?
-Great animal -Nooo...
It's alive!
Uberta.
-Rogers.
I don't care if every one else don't have a day off.
The prince wants a fighting air-force.
And it's my job to get you, birds in shape.
You are in Puffin's army now.
General Puffin!
I am ready for my kiss,
Mademoiselle.
Don't be too disappointed
Jean Bob, if nothing happens.
Finaly, after all these years.
I shall return to my throne.
Don't forget to write.
You still don't believe me, do you?
The only thing you're going to turn is red.
Well, I am ready. Odette.
Walla, well Speed, what do you have to say now?
Uh... -That's what I thought.
And now, if you don't mind,
I've got some shmuzzing to do.
Would you like a kiss too, Speed?
Naaa... I am happy as a turtle.
Bonjour Madame.
Ehh... Uh-uh, the ladies still fall for me.
Will you love me Derek,
Till the day I die?
No, much longer than that, Odette.
Much longer.
Long, long ago, in a faraway land a young woodcarver took secretly to the forest.
His name was Geppetto, and he was shy and quiet.
Oh, and very much in love. l carve this heart for dear Leona... while in this peaceful meadow.
With dreams and hope... my love endures.
Forever yours, Geppetto.
Sooner or later, though, when the heart is full... and the heavens are listening, magic... is bound to happen.
Legendas : Jdacd's
For many years after,
Geppetto kept to his chores, and the forest kept Geppetto's secret.
But the forest knew one thing that Geppetto did not: that miracles don't grow on trees.
Miracles are made in the heart
A log underneath the wheel.
Oh, l got to take you home.
A very good one, too.
All right.
Here we go.
@ My wife's the blushing, blooming rose of dawning

Oops, looks like you've dropped your wood,
Signor Puppetmaker.
Maybe l should be morecareful next time
Let's go boys.
Hey, last one to the bridge gets dunked.
Yoo hoo, everybody. l'm home.
All right, don't say hello.
Hello, little one.
How was your day?
Ah, that's nice. Me... l got lost in the forest.
Used to be a time when west was west.
Are you two fighting again?
What's the problem this time?
He said l have a funny nose. l said you have a funny toes.
Funny nose.
Funny toes.
Now stop it. l'm tired of hearing you two argue.
Stop it!
You know what happens to bad little boys who fight?
They go to bed without being sandpapered. lt's chilly.
There. lt's going to be a chilly night.
This log has a will of it's own.
Let's see if we can find a face to match.
Our heart.
Anyone who wants a new brother, say so now.
All right, all right, don't everybody talk at once. l'm going to make the most perfect nose.
A world of wisdom could be told in a nose.
Open wide.
Give me a big smile.
Nina, go find yourself a mouse.
Blue eyes, just like your papa.
Bellissimo.
Now would you like your papa to show you how to walk?
Yes?
Very nice.
What a smart little boy you are.
Excuse me, coming through!
Now say hello to your brothers and sisters.
Say hello.
They'll keep you company while l'm at work.
Now what shall we call you, dear child, hmm?
You're made of pine.
That's a start.
You have beautiful eyes.
Occhi magnifico.
We'll call you...
Pinocchio!
Pinocchio.
Better to have puppets... than noisy little boys running around.
Oh, my back is... l'm not as young as l used to be.
Nina, leave that puppet alone!
Behave yourself!
Excuse me, coming through.
Ah, get the soap.
Thank you.
Now get me the scrub brush.
Scwub-bwsh. lt's happened. l've finally lost my mind.
Mind... lt's impossible!
You can't be real!
Real.
But you're a puppet!
Pup-peh...
Pa-pa!
No, l'm not your papa!
Wait, Pinocchio.
Stop!
Come down right now!
What are you doing?
Come down this instant, young... man.
Come down here! l'm not going to go chasing after you.
Luigi, please, put a sock in it!
Pinocchio, hold on, l'll save you!
No!
Take off my underwear right now!
Pinocchio, listen to me.
Pinocchio?
Right. Listen to me.
Papa.
No, l--No, that's not--
Well, yes, in a manner of speaking.
No, l'm not your papa.
Papa, papa, papa...
You are a puppet.
You're not a real boy.
Real boy.
No! And be glad for it. lf you were a real boy, you'd have to have doctor istead of--
Sit still!
Look at this mess! l'll have to wash all over again.
Ciao, Geppetto.
Quite a new puppet.
He's amazing.
He still needs work.
So do you. Look at you, you were up all night again.
- l slept a little.
- You were up all night. l made these for Lorenzini's puppets, but l think he needs them more.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Wouldn't want his head to fry, either.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Bet your house is full of sawdust. l'll come by and sweep it up.
Leona, l'm not a child.
The Little one, does he have a name?
Pinocchio.
Enchanted.
Leona
Leona...
You even gave him your heart.
Our heart
What did you say?
Nothing.
Come, Pinocchio.
Come, Pinocchio.
Come, Papa.
Seems a little stiff, Leona.
Just like his father.
Marco, look!
Look here.
Wow! Look at that.
Wow!
Stop it!
What are you doing? lt's your color.
- Did l ask for a scarf?
- No.
Then get rid of it. l'll take that one.
He's magnificent, Geppetto!
Do you see what l see?
Yes!
What?
He is more than-- he's just-- he's...
Well, l--well...
How did you do this? l don't know.
Where are the strings? l-- l don't know.
You don't know. l don't know.
Tino, am l going crazy? l have no idea how this happened.
They're going to burn me at the stake!
No, no, they've stopped burning people.
They might hang you, though.
Excuse me, coming through.
Then you'll know where the strings are.
Are you real boy?
Yes. Are you?
Yes
Hello
Hello
Oh, my, what an intriguing little item you are.
May l?
Empty as a witch's dowry.
Oh, and look how smoothly his arms move.
Volpe, Felinet...
Excuse me, but haven't you two got a pushcart to rob?
We've already done that.
Come, Pinocchio.
Oh, but, Geppetto, darling, we were just playing with him.
He'll play with his own sort, thank you.
And what sort would that be?
Pinocchio, don't wander away like that. l don't want you to do that. l don't get it. ls he a boy or a puppet?
He's a puppet, furface, and he's worth a fortune.
And l know exactly where to cash him in.
Don't worry, son, l'll get your ball back.
Take my kid's ball, would you?
Listen closely.
Next week's puppet show... must be the most spectacular ever.
Every single boy must be in attendance.
Lorenzini, darling.
Felinet, looking for employment? l see my timing is purr-fect!
What l've seen will assure you... more curtain calls than Rome has rats.
Do tell.
There, there. That's better.
That's didn't hurt, did it?
No. Didn't hurt.
What does he want?
Open up.
No good can come of this.
Be very quiet.
Stay here and be quiet
Don't even breathe.
Do you understand?
Open up!
Signor Lorenzini, uh...
Geppetto, my friend.
To want do l owe this honor?
The honor is mine to call a gain on the man... with the magical hands. l bring good news, Geppetto. l am mounting my grandest production ever, and l want to purchase your newest creation... whatever that might be. l've been spending a great deal of time in the forest lately. l will carve you something very special the first chance l get. l was looking for something with, shall we say, thinner strings.
Thinner strings?
Why-- why didn't you say so? Come. l've gotjust the thing.
These wonderful pieces are made of cherry wood, and they are on sale this week only.
Don't toy with me. l didn't buy those puppets from you two years ago, and l'm not going to buy them today, so show me your best... and show me now.
Excuse me. Coming through. lncredibile.
He is perfect.
Stay.
- Boys do little bugs.
- Bugs
Don't they?
They like to tease them... and twist them and--
Please, Lorenzini.
Name your price.
He's not for sale.
- Geppetto, everything is for sale.
- Stay, Stay!
Not him.
Not at any price.
Stay, bug.
You can have the emperor and his daughter, and that's it.
You are making a big mistake,
Geppetto.
That's my last offer.
Take it or leave it.
Very well. l will take these lovely puppets off your hands. l'm just burning with ideas.
Thank you.
Good afternoon, Geppetto.
Pinocchio.
Pinocchio lnfantino is a creep.
Hey, fatty!
You're late, dimwit.
Pinocchio, show yourself right now... because l'm noot leaving this house to look for you again.
Would someone please like to tell us... of a characteristic which separates humans... from the rest of the animal kingdom?
Cages.
Humans cry tears, professore.
Ah, tears.
Expressions of the soul.
Do any other creatures look so deeply within themselves?
No, professore. Only humans.
We must always decide what is right and wrong.
Excellent.
Hey, Woody.
You ever get termites?
What are termites?
They're bugs. l like bugs.
Not these kind, you don't.
They eat wood like you.
Hey, lay off my friend, Woody.
Lay off my friend, Woody.
What is going on in my classroom?
The new kid punched Lampwick, professore. ls that true?
No
Hey, how'd you do that?
Silence.
Now, you're not lying to me by any slim chance, are you?
There are two kinds of lies-- lies that have short legs and lies that have a long nose, and yours are clearly the kind that have long nose.
Now, l will give you one last chance to redeem yourself. lf you didn't punch Lampwick, how did he end up on the floor?
Nobody punched Lampwick.
Lampwick punched himself. l--l mean, a man climed in the window and punched him.
And Lampwick tried to kick him back, but he missed and fell on the floor, and--
Silence. lnfantino!
Silence! lnfantino, go on, go on.
Handkerchief. Go on, quickly.
Run, run, run, run, run!
Right, l did punch Lampwick, professore, and l'm sorry
Well, it's too late for that now. lf there's one thing l will not tolerate... in my classroom, it's a liar.
Out.
And... l'm sorry that l kicked him, too.
Out.
And l'm even more sorry that l told a lie.
Out, out, l said.
But l want to stay and learn.
Now, class, we will review what we have learned today. lf anything happened to him, he's going to be in big trouble. lf l don't find him, l'm never talking to him again.
Pinocchio! lt's finished. lsn't it beautiful?
Everything you bake is beautiful, dear.
You know, l sold it to the magistrate by the pound, and the best part is, l cheated on the weight.
You're very good at that, dear. lt reminds me of the cake that we had on our wedding day.
Don't eat that.
- l'm not eating anything.
- Not you!
Look!
Mmm, more? l'll give you more.
You're a bad boy, huh?
Real bad boy.
Little mischief maker.
Your father's going to pay for this!
Got him.
Even better.
Pinocchio.
Papa, want some?
Geppetto, he's yours?
Arrest him.
Arrest both of them.
You're under arrest, signore.
Wait.
Papa.
Come on. you, too, little one.
Hey, stop him!
There goes our commission.
Au contraire. l have a feeling ourjob just got easier.
Come on, now. lt's past your bedtime. lnto bed.
Good night, son. l love you, Papa. l love you, Papa. l can't do anything right.
The human dilemma.
Who said that?
Or is it the puppet dilemma?
You've still got cake on your face.
What?
Say, do you always squish someone... before being formally introduced?
Are--are you a termite?
Oh, please!
So you're not going to eat me.
Thanks for the offer, but li'm on a low-wood diet.
Let me introduce myself.
The name is...
Pugnacio Elecuzio P. Elegante.
Give me a ''P,'' an ''E,'' a ''P,'' an ''E.''
Put'em all together and call me...
Pepe.
- Pepe?
- You don't like it?
- lt's OK.
- l'm very sensitive, you know.
No. lt's--it's fine.
We can't all be called Pinocchio.
Now listen to me. l'm here because you are one tumult little puppet.
Your papa's in jail, you're all alone, you trounced me in the alley, and l'm here to see that we get our friendship back on track... right this very second!
Sorry.
Didn't meant to holler, but insects are people, too, you know?
And l'm a lot more than your standard garden-variety cricket. l'm a teller of truths. l'll be your best friend, pine cone. l'll open your eyes. l'm not a pine cone. l'm a boy.
Not yet, but it's a top-notch goal... for such a cute little puppet, which is why it's time to get to work.
You ca become a real boy one you get the tools. l'll advise you and be your regal guardian, but you've got to do the hard work.
You, my little sapling, will have to shed something blood, sweat, and tree bark.
Total eclipse.
Visitors. How wonderful.
Get the door, and be polite, and smile, now.
Show those pearly whites.
No, stop.
- Let me go.
- Come on. We've got you now.
Court is now in session.
Case number 491, your honor.
The People versus Luca Antonio
Renaldo Geppetto Baldini.
My papa. lt will be all right, Pinocchio.
There he is, your honor, the little mutilator.
He ruined my cannolis.
He ruined my fruit tarts.
Silence, woman.
He even ruined my grandmother's torta della nonna... with the pinoli and the chocolate--
Are you done?
No, l am not done. l would--
Arrest her!
Now l'm done.
Now...
Since you, Geppetto, are responsible for this, uh, puppet, how do you plead?
Guilty, sir.
You will pay 20,000 lira to the bakers... and 10,000 to the court. l--l don't have it.
That--that's three years' wages. lf you cannot pay, then you will go to debtors prison.
Three years locked away.
Your honor. l propose the court allow me to pay the fines... for this poor, impoverished peasant.
This is most generous of you, Signore Lorenzini.
Kindness is my weakness.
Of course, no good deed should go without obligation, so all l ask is to keep
Pinocchio in return.
Lorenzini, please, take any other puppet. l will work for you day and night the rest of my life.
Geppetto, is itjust money for you?
Pinocchio needs a home.
All you can offer him... is table scarps and cold winter nights, but with me, he will have a family.
What's a family, Papa?
My goodness, such a heartbreaking question, one no one should ever have to ask.
Pinocchio, l can give you a life... other little boys only dream of.
What is your decision, Geppetto?
Listen to me.
You're going to go with that man now.
But l want to be with you. l know, but you see--you see, there--there's no other choice.
You're my papa. l can't be your papa.
You're made of wood.
You're not flesh.
You're not a real boy.
Now go, for everyone's good!
Let's go.
Son.
Good boy. l love you, Papa. l'm sorry.
Why does everything good get thrown to the beasts?
@ No to tyranny
@ He shall not have his pleasure
@ for goodness shall prevail l see gold out there-- little pieces of gold.
Yeah, Woody!
@ All the world is waiting
@ A maiden l must save
@ No time for hesitating
@ lf only l were brave
@ For now is the hour
@ l must be the hero
@ lt's my call, that's my cue
@ lt's everything or nothing
@ Look out, he's coming through
Sorry.
Excuse me. Pardon me.
Coming through. l'll save you--
Sorry.
Puny peasants! l'll save you, princess.
@ Oh, the giant
@ Please stand up in defiance
@ The princess shall be mine!
Hey, you up there with the beard.
@ l was made of freedom
@ Nobody pulls my strings
@ And l can equal any man
@ ln all the grown-up things
@ And l will do or die
@ For l know one thing after all
@ The bigger any giant comes
@ The harder he may fall
@ My hero
@ He saved me
@ My hero, my hero, my hero, my hero, my hero l love being a star.
Of course you do.
All real boys love being stars.
Now this is all yours,
Pinocchio.
You can buy anything you want, and after tonight, there will be more.
Here.
Now hurry, son.
Get ready for the next scene.
Champagne.
OK, kiddo, now we're in the swing of things.
Lesson number one-- beware of temptation.
Applause may be good for the moment, but love is everlasting. l do have love.
Lorenzini loves me.
That's not love.
He's fooling you.
He's got evil plans in the works, and he's using you to make them come true.
Why do you have to make everything so hard?
No pain, no gain.
They love us.
To success.
Wait till they see what l've got for them next.
Pinocchio, you're on.
@ What are we made of?
@ Can we know what we will be?
@ Whar are the chances
@ l can find the better path
@ The better life
@ The better me?
@ What are we made of?
@ lf you think you know the answer
@ Turn arround
@ Think again
@ Carabonza!
@ The fire-breathing monster
@ Alas, we are undone
Stand by for fireworks.
Here's your proof, Pinocchio.
This is how much
Lorenzini loves you.
You can save the others, if you want.
This is your chance, Pinocchio.
You can do what's right.
Those puppets are your brothers and sisters.
Stop it.
Brilliant acting, Pinocchio.
Geppetto made them. l won't let them burn.
Good work!
- No.
- Yes. ls it hot in here, or is it me? Ciao!
Come here, you little--
There.
Get him.
Signor Lorenzini, l'm sorry things didn't quite work out. l don't know. l think things turned out rather well. l guess you'll pay us our commission now, huh?
Pay you? l will kill you if you don't bring me that puppet. l thought you were burned.
Where's my Pinocchio?
There he is! On the bridge!
Grab him!
@ What are we made of?
@ Just for this moment
@ Take your life into your hands
@ You'll decide what you are made of
@ What it is that l can be
@ Turn arround
@ Think again
Pinocchio?
Oh, Leona l've been all over town.
So have l. l hope you had more luck. l asked Carmella if she'd seen Pinocchio.
She said no.
But then l went to see Tino.
He said no.
But then l went to see
Maria, the witch-- the one who hasn't spoken in years.
- What did she say?
- Nothing.
But... she gave me this.
A stick?
What's it mean?
Think about it.
Pinocchio probably feels like he can't come home, like he'd only be in trouble if he does.
Yes...
Where would you go if you felt that way? l... don't know.
Someplace safe.
And where would that be, given the fact that you're made out of wood?
The forest.
Thank you, Maria.
What are you waiting for?
Let's go.
Smell that pine.
You know, they ought to bottle that scent... so you can spray it arround your house.
Have l told you what an honor it is to be your cricket?
You were brilliant last night.
You stayed cool when things got hot.
You did the right thing, and you deserve to be proud.
This is where l belong.
You know, l prefer the beach myself, but property there is so expensive.
You've gone back to your roots. l know you feel lost, Pinocchio.
Believe me, it's only natural, but you can't stay here.
Go away, please. l fell happy here.
You can't sleep your problems away.
You've got to get back to your papa.
Bye.
We've got to roll.
Let's make tracks. Let's go!
Follow me! Off we go!
Run. Run. Run.
Pepe?
Where are you when l need you?
Quit it!
Peck on someone your own size.
''Let's get into the puppet business,'' you said.
- l never--
- Shut up!
- ''We'll be rich,'' you said.
- l didn't...
Shut up. ''He's worth a fortune,'' you said.
Why do l always listen to you?
Get off!
Go away.
Who do you suppose that might be?
Are you serious?
Go away.
Pinocchio!
Out of my way.
Let's put Lorenzini off forjust a few more minutes.
Hey, l know you.
You're friends with Lorenzini.
We're finished with him now.
- We're repugnant.
- Repentant.
Yeah, that, too.
And we're here to ask for forgiveness.
What's forgiveness?
Forgiveness means that when you did something really wrong, you want somebody to tell you... that it wasn't really, really wrong, when you know what you did was wrong because you did it!
Please forgive me for being a puppet, instead of a real boy for my papa. l miss my daddy, too.
You know, it is possible... for you to become a real boy.
How?
All you need is a miracle.
What's a miracle?
A miracle is--
Miracles make your dreams come true, and you could buy one... with enough of these.
Look... l have four more.
Very good.
Will you people be quiet!
Unfortunately, you're just a little short.
But you might have enough if... lf what? lf you planted them and let them grow.
Where?
Why, in the field of miracles, of course.
The field of miracles.
Faster.
Found the perfect spot.
Stop. That's deep enough.
Now cover the hole and let it cook.
For one hour.
Exactly.
Just keep going this way.
Leona, please, don't tell me about the forest. l've been coming out here with my brother, Enzio-- may he rest in peace-- since l was a little boy.
Stop.
He was here.
Maybe he's not far off.
Now you stand here and watch that clock.
The big hand will go all the way around... and come back to the top, and that's an hour.
Got it?
Got it.
@ Our souls are like a cup of cappuccino
@ Strong and dark
@ Strong and dark
Out of the woods, huh?
What are you doing now?
Watching the clock.
Why?
So l can buy a miracle.
Any particular brand?
Real Boy brand.
Here's how it works--
You dig a hole, you plant your gold, you let it cook--
The first lesson about trust is learning whom to trust.
Didn't this gold deal seem a little shaky? l don't know.
A little.
And let me guess... you ignored your instincts.
- Didn't you?
- Maybe.
You just don't give maybe to the president of the Cricket Union.
Now, let's say we regroup and talk about your papa.
Or l'll be falling down on the job.
Look, my papa wants me to be a real boy. l'm staying right here and waiting for my miracle.
Your papa want you, no matter what you're made of.
Be a loving son, and the real boy stuff will take care of itself.
So remember, you heard it here first.
Miracles don't grow on trees.
Miracles are made in the heart.
Stupid me!
Miracles don't grow on trees.
Miracles don't grow on trees.
Hey, Woody!
Stop!
Come on. Come with us.
We're going to the greatest place. lt's great. There's no school.
No rules.
You can do whatever you want.
And it's just for boys.
Just for boys?
Yep. Real boys.
Look. Look. There he is.
Where? l don't see him. l'm sure. l'm going to be a real boy!
Hey, Woody, watch out for your hat.
Welcome to the Terra Magica!
New boys.
[ Skipped item nr. 770 ]
Wait a minute. l thought there were-- l forgot the biggest rule of them all!
There are no rules.
That's more like it!
[ Skipped item nr. 775 ]
[ Skipped item nr. 776 ]
He's out there.
Not necessarily.
What do you think this is? lt's his hat, the one l gave to him. l'm going to go find him.
Now wait one minute.
You're going to kill youself for one of your puppets?
He's my son. l've already let one great love slip through my fingers. l don't want it to happen again.
You've never been in a boat in your life.
You can't even swim. l can row.
But, Geppetto... you may never come back. ln that case, l'll tell you why... you should never have married my brother.
Why?
Because you should have married me!
The day l carved that heart in the tree, you accepted my brother's proposal.
25 years you take to tell me, and l'm supposed to wait?
You're too late. l'm not waiting!
This is foul.
Foul?
Come on, Woody, you're missing all the fun!
Hey, your turn, Woody!
Rather cruel of you to shoot my cousins into outer space.
All l'm doing is having a little fun.
Fun? Your idea of fun... puts my antenna way out of whack, and what about your papa, since you brought him up? l didn't bring him up.
Precisely my point!
You know he wouldn't want you acting like ajackass, and if you act like one, you'll become one!
This is how you light it,
Woody.
Taht's it. l can't go on a trip. l forgot to go to the bathroom!
Act like ajackass, if you have the nerve.
Drink up the water.
Get what you deserve.
Be wicked, be naughty.
Come drink from my fountain, then l will be rich-- king of the mountain.
Let mr try.
Nice shooting.
Look. No, look... l'll show you how.
No!
Sorry.
That's my gun.
No, it's mine, Lampshade.
Nobody calls me Lampshade.
You give me the gun.
Nice shot.
Hey... l can see right through him.
What's all this?
He sarted it.
You liar.
Stop! Let's settle this.
Tokens for the ride of your life.
You have all earned it.
For you... and you.
Hey, swiss cheese, we're going on the big one.
Me, too.
Sell these jackasses to the circus... and at the market--
20,000 lira each-- then skin one... for a new pair of boots.
We're going on the big one, Woody.
The big one.
Here we go.
Aw, yeah.
Coming through! l'm a real boy. l'm a real boy.
Come on! Whoa! Faster!
All right!
Hey, Woody, you're leaking! l guess some guys just can't hold their water.
Faster!
What's wrong with you? l don't know. l don't feel so good.
You don't look so good, either.
Where'd you get that?
Here's another batch, signor.
Corral them. l don't want to be ajackass. l don't want to be ajackass.
Don't panic, Pinocchio.
Keep your wits.
Please, Pepe, get me out of here.
You can do it. Be brave.
Don't let fear tie you up.
Yikes!
One of them didn't drink their water, signor!
- Catch him!
- He's gone.
Don't let him get away!
Go and find him!
There...behind the donkey.
Calm these donkeys!
Of course, signore.
Go. Go. Go.
Come on. Go.
Run!
Get him! l will break you into firewood... puppet!
Come here. Over here.
No, this is all wrong.
You got to believe me.
Look, they're trying to trick you.
They wants us to behave badly.
Don't go on the ride. Please!
We've been acting like jackasses, so that's what we turn into.
Well, well, well...
Here l provide you with the most wonderful place to frolic, and this is the thanks l get?
You steal my donkeys?
They're not your donkeys.
This one's Lampwick.
Pinocchio, a good boy does not go around spreading lies. lt's not a lie.
My nose grows when l lie.
Come on, boys. Take the ride.
Drink the water.
No, don't!
Be yourselves!
Lampwick...
Go on.
He's turning into a monster.
Look at his face.
Lorenzini's turned into a monster.
Lorenzini was a monster.
He was a monster and got what he deserved.
Jackasses! l'm going home.
Thanks, Pinocchio.
Home home home home! l don't care if l never become a real boy anymore. l just want to get home to my papa.
There you are. l knew you didn't go out to sea.
Where have you been?
We were so worried, and look at you.
Have you eaten?
You're so skinny.
Where is my papa?
He's out there somewhere, looking for you.
Wait, Pinocchio! lt's too dangerous. lf you think l'm going to wait... for both of you--
You don't even know how to swim. l'm not scared. l'm not scared. l smell seaweed.
Are--are we at the beach?
Pepe, l thought you left me.
Ahoy, captain.
Where are we now?
Boy, you sure get into a let of trouble.
You know, it smells an awful lot... like rotten chili peppers in here.
Lorenzini, he must be the sea monster.
OK. Fine. Enjoy yourself. l'm playing cricket this afternoon.
Hey, l'm a clamophobic.
Quiet.
We're in this together, now.
But--but--but l'm afraid of the dark.
Papa!
Oh, sure, like he's just around the corner.
He might be.
Oh, you two had plans to meet here for dinner?
- Quiet.
- Sorry.
Excuse me.
Coming through. lf only it were true.
Where were you?
Let's try to find a way out of here.
Come. lt smells like rotten chili peppers in here.
The throat. hold on.
Pinocchio, hold on.
Go, Pinocchio.
Not without you.
Go, l said.
No. Push it open. l can't get through there.
Now, do as l say! l hate you, Papa.
What? l never, ever missed you.
That's a lie. l wish l never found you. l never wanted to be your son. l want to stay a puppet.
Lies, all lies.
Don'tjudge my cooking by this, OK?
Are you OK, Papa?
Wake up.
Forgive me, Pinocchio... for doubting my heart and letting you go. l'm sorry, too, Papa. l'm sorry for not... for not being a rea boy.
But you're real to me, my son.
Real to me.
Oh, l love you. l love you, too, Papa. l'm a boy.
Tell me it's true.
Miracles are made in the heart, Papa.
Yoo-hoo, hello. l'm in the dark in here.
What am l missing?
Have the pilgrims landed? l don't even want to know what happened.
Keep it to youself.
Nice to know you, junior.
Lots of luck.
You look good in the flesh, a real doll--uh, boy, but l got to go. Ciao.
You're leaving again? l'm just starting to have a good time.
Leaving?
That would make me a hypo-cricket.
Union rules-- l'm with you forever. l just got to get some sleep.
Papa! Pap, stop the cart.
- What?
- Please stop the cart.
There's just one more little thing... l need to take care of. lt'll only take a minute. l'm not going to sleep in no barn.
Fine, then sleep in the doghouse.
Hello.
Don't you answer back when a person greets you?
Hello.
Haven't l seen you somewhere before?
No. Believe me, l just got here.
That sure isn't very much gold you've got there.
Excuse me, sonny. We're rich.
That's not rich.
This is rich.
That's nothing but a rock.
Yes, but if you take this road five miles, there's a valley. l've been there.
Drinking the water turns bad boys into donkeys.
Get out of here.
Fine, then l won't tell you about the gold.
Gold?
Keep this to yourselves. lf you drink the water while holding onto a rock...
Yeah? lt turns into gold.
Gold?
Would l lie?
Bye.
See you later, Papa.
Pinocchio, where are you going?
To play with Lampwick.
Did you do your studies and all of your chores?
Yes, Papa.
Sometimes l wish that nose still grew.
Lampwick.
Come on, Woody, let's go.
Careful!
We're--we're very sorry, sir.
Yeah. Let us pick these up.
- Donn't you just hate that kid?
- Not as much as l hate you.
Papa, Papa, l've got a great idea.
How about carving me a girlfriend?
You've been a boy two minutes, already you're thinking about girls?
Am l going to have trouble with you!
And there you have it.
Geppetto and Leona lived happily ever after.
Luigi ate a lot of socks, and all the donkeys turned back into boys. lt took some hard work.
They had to do many good deeds to earn the privilege.
As for me, l took a house on Lake Como... and played canasta with a couple of locusts.
So, ciao, my little saplings.
Arrivederci!
And when you need me, give me a holler.
We'll see if we can arrange something.
This is James Henry Trotter.
He lived with his mother and father in a cosy little house by the sea.
Hey. I've got ya.
Happy birthday, darling.
Now, quickly. Blow them out before the wind does.
Make a wish first.
It was a wonderful life.
They had each other, and they had their dreams.
Look!
That cloud looks like a camel.
And that one over there looks like a train engine.
Now, can you see the tallest building in the world?
I can't find it.
Try looking at it another way.
I see it!
That's where we're going... on a great ship that will take us across the ocean.
And we'll go right to the top of that building.
The three of us, on top of the world.
Are there any kids there like me?
Hundreds of them.
It's a wonderful place,James.
A city where dreams come true.
Then, one day, a terrible thing happened.
An angry rhinoceros appeared out of nowhere... and gobbled up his poor mother and father.
Their troubles-- if they had any at all-- were over in 35 seconds flat.
But James's troubles were just beginning.
For now, he lives here with Aunt Sponge...
Get up, you lazy little bug. and Aunt Spiker.
- You already wasted four minutes of daylight.
- Look at him.
Lollygagging in dreamland when there's so much work to be do.
Weeds to pull, wood to chop.
Work, work, work, work, work!
Wouldn't want one of those nesting in your knickers.
I look and smell--
I do declare-- as lovely as a rose.
Just feast your eyes upon my face.
Observe my shapely nose.
Behold my heavenly, silky locks.
And if I take off both my socks, you'll see my dainty toes.
But don't forget, my dearest Sponge, how much your tummy shows.
You lazy bug!
- Who told you to stop working?
- I finished the wood.
A travel book? How dare you even dream of leaving!
This is the only home you'll ever have.
No one else would tolerate a worthless little nothing like you.
Where did you get this? Where?
Father gave it to me.
He said we were to go there one day.
- Stupid, foolish man.
- Foolish man. Always dreaming.
- That's what got him killed.
- And your mother.
Had his head in the clouds instead of looking where he was going!
- He never even saw that rhino coming.
- That rhino.
And the beast will get you, too, if you don't behave.
Now get these stupid dreams out of your head!
And get back to work!
Careful, Spongy. Wouldn't want to ruin that girlish figure.
Oh, shut up.
- Yes?
- I've finished all of the chores.
What a coincidence.
We've finished all the dinner.
Oh, Sponge.
You're such a tease.
There's something special waiting for you in the oven.
Oh, do let me guess.
They're not good enough for him.
What do you think this is?
Buckingham Palace?
Get out of our sight!
Go on!
Go on!
Hello there!
Where did you come from?
You know, you probably shouldn't build your web up here in the window.
Spiker and Sponge might see you, and they hate spiders.
I'll be your friend, though.
My name is James
That's what Mother called me
My name is James
So it's always been
Sometimes I forget
When I'm lonely or afraid
Then I'll go inside my head
And look for James
Here's something
I've never shown anyone.
There's a city that I dreamed of
Very far from here
Very, very far away from here
Very far away
There are people in the city
And they're kind to me
But it's very, very far away you know
Very far
They'll say, James, James
James, how are ya
Isn't it a lovely day
James, James, James
We're so glad you came here
Where we are
From so very, very, very far
My name is James
James, James
Good night. Pleasant dreams.
Spider! Vermin! Oh, beast!
No! Wait!
- Spider!
- Wait! I'll get it! I'll get it!
Kill it! Kill it! Kill it!
Where is it?
Get it! Get it!
- Kill it.
- Get it! Get it!
Kill it!
You hit me in the face.
You hit me in the face!
Oh, do shut up!
Go on. Get out of here. Get as far away from this place as you possibly can.
Oh, I wish I could.
What's stopping you?
Oh, don't be frightened,James.
I mean you no harm.
How'd you know my name?
I know more than just your name.
What would you say if I were to tell you... that the answer to all your troubles is right here... inside this little bag?
- Hey! That's my--
- Of course it is.
Go on,James. Have a look.
There's more magic in them things... than in all the rest of the world put together.
But what are they?
- Crocodile tongues.
- Tongues?
One thousand long, slimy crocodile tongues.
Boiled in the skull of a dead witch for 20 days and 20 nights.
Add the fingers of a young monkey, the gizzard of a pig, the beak of a parrot and three spoonfuls of sugar.
Stew for a week, and then let the moon... do the rest.
Have 'em, and marvelous things will happen.
Things even you never dreamt of.
- Like what?
- Well, like... you'll never be miserable again.
And you are miserable, aren't you,James?
You weren't meant to be, you know.
And that place you're dreamin' of, it's not as far away as you think.
New York City!
And it'll be that much closer, once you take the first step.
But how? This doesn't make any sense.
Not up here, it doesn't.
The answers are in here, and the magic is in here.
So,James, what'll it be?
Now listen to me,James. Don't let them get away, because if they do, they'll work their magic on whoever or whatever they meet first.
Understand?
Good.
What's going on out here?
No! No, wait!
Wait! No! No, wait!
Wait.Just a-- Wait.
Here he is.
Get up, you little worm!
- We sent you out here to kill a spider.
- Not to laze about.
I wasn't lazing about.
I tripped.
How dare you disagree with us!
Beat him, Sponge.
It's too early.
Well, that makes you the luckiest boy alive.
Now come inside and get dressed.
Spiker, look! A peach.
- A what?
- A peach! There! On that branch.
Why, that old tree's never had so much as a blossom on it, let alone a--
Well, I'll be blowed.
There really is a peach there.
A nice, big one too.
How can we get it?
- The boy.
- Now, you be a good little boy... and climb up there and get that peach for your dear aunties.
- Can we eat it?
- Of course we can. We'll share it.
Me and your Aunt Spiker!
Now start climbing.
- Wait!
- What? What? What?
It's-It's growing!
- The boy?
- No. The peach, you idiot!
Look!
- Come down.
- But I won't get hurt.
Climb down!
What a peach. What a peach!
Look, Spiker! It's still growing!
I'm not blind, you dolt.
I can see it myself.
Look at it go! It's a miracle!
It's coming down. Stand back!
My heavens! My--
Marvelous things will happen, just like he said.
Shut up, you little grub.
This has nothing to do with you, so just keep away from it.
Can you smell that, Spikey?
It smells delicious.
No!
It smells like money.
Roll up. Roll up.
See the giant peach.
The Eighth Wonder of the World.
Have your money ready, ladies and gentlemen.
Chance of a lifetime.
Ten bob only.
No peeking at the peach! Have your money ready, ladies and gentlemen.
In you go.
- Can we touch it?
- Touch it? You want to touch it?
- She'll be wanting to taste it next.
- Admission refused.
This child has too many cheeky ideas. Go away!
- Quite right.
- Ooh, splendid.
A photographer.
- And another.
- Best side.
- Move on in.
- No cameras allowed.
Don't dawdle. Come along, ladies and gentlemen!
- Sorry, Father. It'll cost you double.
- May God forgive you.
Thank you, Father.
Come along, children.
Last chance of the day.
Yoo-hoo! Come down here.
Yes, Auntie Sponge?
Ooh! You're all spiffed up.
I was hoping to play with the children.
The children have gone.
But you can play with their garbage.
Garbage.
And don't even think of going near our peach.
'Cause if you do, remember:
They never did catch that rhino.
No! Wait a moment! Wait!
'Ere, now. Where do you think you're going, Yank?
I'm goin' stir crazy.
I gotta take a look around.
Plan our escape from Spiker and Sponge.
Escape? To where? We'll all be squashed, swatted, smooshed!
No one's going to smoosh you, my dear boy.
- You're six feet long now.
- Bigger target.
Let the biddies come.
I'll take 'em both on.
I'm indefeatable.
I'm indivisible. I'm...
- Whoa!
- in trouble!
It's Spiker and Sponge!
They've found us!
Hello!
No, no, no. It's the lad from the house. What's his name?
- Miserable tick.
- I thought it was " rotten little grub.''
No. That's what those horrible aunts call him.
His real name is--
Well, it's-- uh, uh--
It's James.
Look what you've done now, miss.
Scared him to death.
Please! Don't eat me!
- Eat you?
- Hey, Glow-worm. Turn up your lights.
- I'm a vegetarian.
- I eat dirt.
No one will be eating you,James.
Nah. She'll just puncture your head and suck out the brains.
- That I am saving for you.
- Whoa! Pretty fast, long legs.
Oh, such rude behaviour.
There's no need to be frightened, dearie.
But you're enormous bugs!
Fascinating, isn't it?
We've all changed, and so have you,James.
The old man-- the one who gave me the green things-- he said marvelous things would happen.
Did he say,
"marvelous pigs in satin''?
No, dear lady.
"Marvelous things will happen.''
Poor Glow-worm.
She's a little deaf.
I, however, have exquisite hearing.
Yeah? Well, listen to this.
Let's get outta here!
You mean leave the hill?
I can't! The rhino will get me.
Rhino?
I say, dear boy.
I've lived on this miserable hill for decades.
There are no rhinoceri here.
Except for Sponge.
She's twice as big as a rhino, eh, kid?
And twice as dangerous.
My life hangs by a thread every day.
I've had to send all 300 of me children to safer pastures.
Hah! You think hiding in solid rock is fun?
I can't even remember what fun is.
Well, that's just 'cause you been stuck here too long.
Listen to me, kid. I know a place that will refresh your memory.
Bright lights
Big city
That's where we gotta go
Where the food is great and the bugs are so pretty
I'd like to get my arms around a hundred or so
I'd hug 'em, squeeze 'em hold 'em tight
Sleep all day
Dance all night
I want the bright lights and the big city
That's the life for me, yeah
That's the life for--
You little maggot
Have you never seen the moon
Gliding 'cross the western sky
A dead oak tree by the waterside
Putrid vapours rising
That sounds lovely, dear.
I'm sure we all agree.
But I prefer the sunshine
A little park right in the centre of the town
Flowers everywhere
Children all around me, I'd love it
Landing on a baby's cheek so warm
- It's wonderful
- Wonderful
That's the life for me
That's the life for me
That's the life
That's the life for me
- Elegant conversation
- Bright lights, big city
- An elevated point of view
- That's where I'd go
- Intellectual stimulation
- Yeah, maybe for you.
And someone you love to share it with you
It would be wonderful
Wonderful
- That's the life for me
- You call that a life?
- That's the life for me
- It's no pile of dirt.
That's the life
That's the life
That's the life
That's the life for--
Where are you hiding, boy?
Time to go make a pest of myself.
Look at this place.
It's still filthy.
Where are you, you detestable little worm?
Not you. Me!
You better not be near our peach.
Oh, please!
Don't let them spray us!
Spray us? They'll see the Yank up there and come after us with a shovel.
- It happened to my brother.
- How awful.
Split him right down the middle.
Now I have two half-brothers.
Shh! They'll hear us.
Yoo-hoo! Where are you, boy?
I think I hear a rhino out here.
Ahh. This'll be a snap.
Shh! I really do hear something.
Timber.
- What's that?
- Fasten your seat belts, kids.
Ahh! The car!
- We're turning!
- Wha-Wha-What have you done?
Start, start, you piece of junk.
It's the peach! Our peach!
We'll be killed!
Whoa! I'm falling head over head over head!
Here, stomach! Here, stomach!
Here, stomach!
I'm gonna be sick.
Our peach!
Where are we?
Ow! Somebody pinched me.
Sorry. I thought you were the spider.
Ouch! What was that?
Excuse. I thought you were the centipede.
Hey, Glow-worm.
How about some light?
I can't hear you, dear.
I'll have to put my light on.
Oh! Oh! This is so "unladybug-like.''
Don't worry. I'll have you right-side up in no time.
Thank you,James.
- Where are you going?
- To see where we've landed.
Whoa!
Oh, my!
Oh, my, my.
Oh, my achin' back.
Oh!
Fascinating, isn't it?
What? What's fascinating?
Tell me. Don't leave me dangling.
We're in the middle of the-- how do you say-- the big puddle?
Biggest puddle of them all, angel fangs. The Atlantic Ocean.
Technically, the Pacific is larger.
Well, that goes without saying.
But there is land in sight?
Nothing but blue skies and clear waters.
- This is all your fault.
- Hey!
If it wasn't for me, we'd all be Spiked and Sponged by now!
This old man with his green things-- did he happen to speak to where we are going?
No. All he said was the answers would be right here.
My travel book!
And look! It's the peach!
We're going to New York City!
New York? They love me there!
Wonderful! They've got a whole park full of leaves for you, Miss Ladybug.
- Central Park.
- And loads of dark hiding places.
- Nightclubs.
- And museums and concerts.
- Not to mention Yankee Stadium.
- What about me?
Why, they've got miles and miles of underground tunnels.
The subway!
My father says it's the place where dreams come true.
- That's the life for me
- That's the life for me
- That's the life for me
- That's the life for me
- That's the life
- That's the life
That's the life
That's the life for me
New York it is, then.
Now, how do we get there?
- I'll get us there!
- You?
Sure! I've sailed all the five seas.
From the sun-drenched reefs of Bora Bora... to the icy shores of Tripoli.
"Commodore Centipede,'' they used to call me.
- Seven.
- Huh?
There are seven seas, and Tripoli is in the subtropics, Commodore.
- Trim the sails!
- There are no sails.
- Stoke the engine!
- There are no engines.
I can't work with this miserable crew.
Great! We're stuck here until we shrivel up and die.
- Highly improbable.
- That's a relief.
We're far more likely to drown.
Oh, no!
I know! We could--
No. It's a stupid idea.
- Compared to what?
- Hey!
Well, we could fly out.
He's right. It's stupid.
How would you do it,James?
With the seagulls, but we'll need string.
Oh. Well, I'll just go to the stationer's... and pick up some paper clips while I'm at it.
I have string.
Miles of string.
And we'll need bait; bird bait.
Bird bait? Where do you expect we're gonna find bird bait... out here in the middle of the-- the--
Oh, no! No, no!
Have you lost your minds?
They've lost their minds!
Anything but birds!
Don't worry. I'm right here.
- Now wiggle.
- No!
But they won't come if you don't wiggle.
Exactly!
And you can't make me.
Oh, yeah?
Hey, no fair! Mockingbirds munched me mother!
Here comes the first one.
Get ready to pull down there.
My sisters were swallowed by swallows!
Pull!
It worked! I got one!
Shh! I hear teeth.
Great, big, gnashing teeth.
Sounds like a rhinoceros.
In the ocean?
Scientifically impossible.
I hear something too.
It's a school of tuna.
They're being sucked into some sort of machine.
- What do you mean?
- Take a look.
It's a giant shark!
It seems to have spotted us.
- What do we do? What do we do?
- The seagulls!
It's our only chance!
It would take the whole flock and then some. We'll never do it in time.
We'll use Miss Spider's web for a net. Hurry!
Throw it here, dearie.
Wiggle, Mr Earthworm.
Our lives depend on it.
I can't! I'm all wiggled out.
Here. Let me help you.
Come and get it!
Get your fresh, hot wienie!
Come on, baby.
I got 'em! Hand me the loops!
- Hurry!
- Shake a leg, there.
Keep your pants on.
I've only got 1 2 hands.
It's getting closer.
Seagulls, away!
- Oh, no!
- Oh, dear!
They're getting away!
Hop on,James!
Now, grab them!
Help!
Hooligans! Ruffians!
Degenerates!
- Come on, seagulls!
- Put your backs into it!
Shake your bloomin' tail feathers!
Good sharky. Nice sharky.
Sharky!
Hooray!
All right! Teach you to mess with me, you overgrown sardine!
I'm from Brooklyn.
Pure twaddle! Every bug on board displayed extraordinary courage.
Why, did you see Miss Ladybug risk life and wing... to bash those brutes on the snoot?
Well, they were being very rude.
I can't abide rudeness.
We are all forgetting something.
Everything we did was part of the brilliant plan of James.
It really did work, didn't it?
- I say three cheers for James. Hip-hip.
- Hooray!
- Hip-hip.
- Hooray!
- Hip-hip.
- Hooray!
New York, here we come!
Whoever you are, keep away from me! Keep away!
Mr Earthworm, it's me!
Oh,James!
Oh, thank goodness.
You mustn't frighten yourself like this all the time.
- Why not?
- You'll make yourself sick.
When I had a problem, my mum and dad would tell me to look at it another way.
How? First I was bird bait.
Then I was shark bait.
I suppose. Or you could say you gave us wings to fly... and defeated a giant shark single-handedly.
- No-handedly.
- Exactly. You're a hero.
I am? I'm Wonder Worm!
You are.
Want food.
Food.
Are you sure you know where we're going?
I don't see how you can navigate without a compass.
It's very hot up here.
I'm roasted.
- Unhand that bird!
- But I'm dyin' of hunger.
Well, perhaps I have a bit of soda bread in here somewhere.
- Food?
- It's not much, but it's--
- Not so fast!
- Hey!
- You?
I need this food.
I have a much higher metabolism.
- Bite me!
- What?
- Have you two gone mad?
Let go of it, gramps!
- Give it! Give it to me!
- Let go of my coat!
- Give it to me!
- Ow! My lower thorax.
- I'll rip you apart!
- I tell you, it's mine!
- Give it back!
Now look what you've done!
We're going to starve.
Waste away. And not quickly.
Oh, no. That would be the easy way out. We'll linger.
Slowly. Miserably. Painfully.
Nobody's going to starve.
Don't you see? We have enough food here for five voyages.
- Food? Where?
- Is there really food?
- What are you talkin' about?
Our whole ship is made of food.
Oh, such a clever little boy.
Takes after me.
After you, there is nothing left to take.
Delectable!
- Better than aphids.
- Better than ladybugs.
- What?
- Excuse.
It's not dirt, but it's not bad.
"Not bad''? It's the best thing
I've ever tasted, and I have tasted a lot.
I've eaten many strange and scrumptious dishes in my time
Like chilli bugs and curried slugs
And earwigs cooked in slime
And mice with rice is very nice
When they're roasted in their prime
But don't forget to sprinkle them with just a pinch of grime
I'm crazy 'bout mosquitos on a piece of buttered toast
And pickled spines of porcupines and then a great, big roast
And dragon's flesh
Quite old, not fresh
It costs a buck at most
Does it come with gravy?
It comes to you in barrels if you order it by post
It comes to you in barrels if you order it by post
For dinner on my birthday
Shall I tell you what I chose
Hot noodles made of poodles on a slice of garden hose
And a rather smelly jelly
Made of armadillos' toes
The jelly is delicious
But you have to hold your nose
Peach, peach, peach, peach
Peach, peach, peach, peach
Peach, peach, peach, peach
I crave the tasty tentacles of octopi for tea
I like hot dogs but I love hot frogs and surely you'll agree
A plate of soil with engine oil's a super recipe
Recipe
I hardly need to mention that it's practically free
Peach, peach, peach, peach
Peach, peach, peach, peach
Peach, peach, peach, peach
Peach, peach, peach, peach
We hardly need to mention that it's practically free
Now comes, my fellow travelers the burden of my speech
- You show-off!
- These foods are rare, beyond compare
And some right out of reach
Nice aim, Commodore.
But there's no doubt
I'd go without
A million plates of each
Out of my face!
- For one small mite
- One small mite
One tiny bite
Tiny bite of this fantastic peach
- Peach, peach, peach, peach
Peach, peach, peach, peach
- Stop! Stop!
- Peach, peach, peach, peach
- Wha-Wha-Wha-What's going on?
- Bull's-eye!
- Comin' at you!
- Watch this!
This fantastic peach
You keep to yourself, don't you?
I prefer to be alone.
I was alone for a long time once.
I think it's much nicer to have friends. Don't you?
I would not know.
They would be your friends too-- the others, I mean-- if you'd just let them.
No. It is in their nature to have fear of me.
- This I cannot change.
- You're very kind to me.
Maybe this is because you are kind to me first.
You were the spider in my window!
You were my first friend.
I mean, since I went to live with my aunts.
- They hated me!
- Shh! Do not think of them now.
But what if they find us?
What if we don't make it to New York?
I'll die if I have to go back to the way I was! They can't make me!
Nobody can make you do anything,
James, if you do not let them.
You are a brave boy.
Now, to sleep.
You have had a very tired-making day.
Look! The little maggot's stuffing his face with our peach!
Get him, Sponge.
You can't crawl away from us!
- The rhino will get you.
- The rhino will get you.
- The rhino will get you.
- The rhino will get you.
The rhino will get you.
The rhino will get you.
The rhino will get you!
This is an outrage!
You are a disgrace to your phylum, class, order, genus and species!
- Say it in English!
- You, sir, are an ass!
Where are we?
What's going on?
I found this dime-store Timmy asleep at the helm.
- Now we're lost.
- We are not lost!
- Then where are we?
- Somewhere north!
Or possibly very, very far south.
What's your latitude?
What's your longitude?
Hey, hey, hey!
That's personal, bub.
- You said you could navigate!
- You said you'd traveled the world.
You said you'd been to Bora Bora.
- Well, not Bora Bora, per se. Uh--
- What about the shores of Tripoli?
Did I say "Tripoli''?
I meant the halls of Montezuma.
- That's what you said.
- Never have I heard such mendacity!
- You liar.
- Charlatan!
- Wait!
If he says he's seen the world, then he's seen the world.
Right, Mr Centipede?
Right?
Well, I did used to live between two pages of a National Geographic.
-Huh?
-Very informative magazine, the National
Geographic. Wonderful pictures.
You incompetent, blithering nitwit!
All right, hoppy!
Them's fightin' words!
Put 'em up! Put 'em up!
Come on! Give me your best shot!
Whoa! Good shot.
Did you see what he did to me?
Hmph! Serves ya right.
- What do we do now? Which way do we go?
- Oh, it's simple, really.
All we need to do is determine our coordinates, then use triangulation to chart a direct route to New York.
- Then there's hope.
- Don't be ridiculous.
There's no hope at all.
We don't have a compass.
We'll never reach New York.
We're gonna be stuck here forever.
We're gonna be frozen like living statues.
Dead living statues.
No dark hiding places.
No cosy leaf in the park.
No city where dreams come true.
- Don't ships have compasses?
- No doubt.
But to brave those icy waters would mean certain death.
Only a fool would do it.
Geronimo!
- What? What? What was that?
- The centipede jumped in!
Good heavens!
He's committed pesticide!
Oh, this is all my doing.
Don't take all the credit.
I helped too.
- I have to go after him!
- Not on your life. You'll catch your death of cold.
- But he's my friend!
-James is right.
Centipede is one of us.
Get on my back. I am going with you.
- You had better take good care of him.
- This I promise.
Stay by the line, and when you feel two tugs, pull us up.
A skellington?
Jackpot! A genuine compass!
Sounds like you need a little oil, Captain.
Thank you, sir!
I'll be shovin' off now.
I shoulda worn a belt!
Holy shipwreck!
Listen, fellas. I got a long history of back problems, and I don't need it to get any longer.
Hey. That one felt pretty good.
It's Paul Bunyan comin' to cut me some slack.
Whoa! Hey, pal.
You're aimin' a little low.
He's gonna cut me in half!
Hey, sailors!
Looking for some kicks?
Cut me loose!
Get the compass!
I've got it!
Gotcha!
Polly want a smacker?
Look out!
- Sounds like big trouble.
- Get ready to pull.
I got a good one for ya. Why don't skeletons play music in church?
Oh. Thank goodness!
You're all right.
- What happened to Centipede?
- He found a compass for us.
- And a shipload of pirates!
- Hold this. I am going back.
Do be careful, Miss Spider.
Poor Centipede.
He saved our lives down there.
- Look out!
- Miss Spider!
- Centipede!
- How am I lookin', kid?
Oh, Centipede. I do not know whether to kill you or kiss you.
- Well, I-- Say, I'm sorry.
- I'm so sorry.
- My sincere apologies.
- I just, I just wanna apologize.
- I just wanted to say--
- What I'm tryin' to say--
That's enough chit-chat!
I'm freezing!
Hello? The compass is ready.
Mr Centipede, would you please do us the honour... of navigating us out of this icebox?
It would be my pleasure.
I believe our position puts us very close to--
I admire your bravery,
Miss Spider. I really do.
Why, thank you, Mrs Ladybug.
All right, boys.
Coffee break's over.
I'm looking forward to a hopping good time... in the Big Apple, Mr Centipede.
You said it, Mr Grasshopper.
Oh, boy. What I wouldn't do for a cup of coffee.
Cup of joe.
I say, old sport. Came to relieve you of your duties.
I said I'd steer the peach.
Have to steer the peach.
- Can't quit now.
- Good show, old boy.
Thanks, Mr Grasshopper.
- That music.
- Oh, Sir James! D-Did I disturb you?
So sorry.
I-I-I-I'll put this away.
No, no! I like it.
I used to hear it at my aunts' house before I went to sleep.
That was you, wasn't it?
Or do all grasshoppers play music?
All grasshoppers try.
I'm sure you've heard this.
Ghastly, isn't it? Cricket stuff.
- Music should be the voice of the soul.
- What does that mean?
It means that when I'm happy, my music sounds like this.
And when I'm sad, it's like this.
When I was sad, I used to climb in bed with my mum and dad.
But that was a long time ago.
I'm sure they'd be very proud of you,James.
I know we are.
Take a little time
Just look at where we are
We've come very, very far
Together
And if I might say so
And if I might say so too
We wouldn't have got anywhere
If it weren't for you, boy
Love is the sweetest thing
Love never comes just when you think it will
Love is the way we feel for you
We're family
We're family
- We're family
- All of us
And you
Think of where we'd be
- If we were on our own
- We'd be dead.
- You're what holds us all together
- I am?
And if I might say so
And if we might say so too
We never could love anyone
As much as we love you
- Love
- Is the strangest thing
Love
Does exactly what it wants to do
- Love
- Boy, ya know it's true
We're family
We're family
We're family
Me, me, me, me, me and you
Ashes to ashes
And dust to dust
Without you there'd be no "us''
Love is the sweetest thing
Love does exactly what it wants to do
Love is the way we feel for you
We're family
We're family
We're family
Me
And you
We'll always be together, won't we?
Kid, you're stuck with us for life.
Look, everybody. We made it!
- We did?
- New York City.
- Breathtaking!
- Stunning!
- Oh, how glorious!
- Look at the park!
- It's fabulous.
- We have made it!
What a wonderful sight!
There's Lady Liberty.
I can almost smell the lovely dirt.
- Is it not beautiful?
- The Empire State Building!
See those lights! Wa-hoo!
Yippee! Attaboy, Jimmy!
Good show,James!
The city awaits us.
Now, remember,James. First impression is very important.
- Oh, no!
- We'll be blown off course!
We'll wind up in Jersey!
- Could it be--
- No. It couldn't be.
- It's the rhino!
- Oh,James. Do something.
Everyone, climb up into the rigging!
Hurry!
James, are you not coming with us?
No! It got my mum and dad.
It won't get my friends!
Come out and show your face, you stupid beast!
Good God Almighty!
Remember what your parents said,James:
"Try looking at it another way.''
You're not even a real rhino!
You're just a lot of smoke and noise!
I'm not afraid of you!
I'm not afraid of you!
James!
No!
Miss Spider? Mr Grasshopper?
Hello? Is anyone there?
This isn't right.
Where's the Empire State Building?
What in the--
Officer! There's a boy up there!
What? A boy?
Mabel, we got us a huge, unidentified object here.
- What's it look like?
- Round, fuzzy.
- It looks sorta like a giant fruit or something.
- Well, what is it?
I don't know what it is!Just send us the biggest crane in New York!
Please, sir. How do I get to the Empire State Building?
You're on top of it, kid.
We made it!
Well, I made it.
Hang on.
Have you seen any big bugs tonight?
Big bugs? How big?
I hope they're all right.
Let's go. Let's go.
Stay back. Stay back.
Don't worry, kid.
You'll be all right.
Come on, sonny.
Don't be afraid, now. I got ya.
Stay away from the fruit!
- Who's that? Hey!
- What is this thing?
- Where you from?
- Why you here?
- Who?
- What?
- Where?
- When?
- Hold your fire, fellas!
He's just a kid, for Pete's sake.
Here. I got you now.
It's okay, little guy.
Nobody's going to hurt ya.
Move back for them.
No.
Hello, little angel.
So kind of you to look after our little lost lamb.
- Who are you?
- We are the boy's legal guardians.
And we've missed him so much.
So we'll just take him home now.
And the peach, of course.
We're taking that as well.
Well, wait a minute.
Wait, wait, wait. Back up.
You mean to tell me that this thing is a peach?
- It's not " a peach.'' It's our peach.
- Our peach.
- Show him, Spongy.
- Yes.
-Looks like it's their peach, all right.
-Yes.
- Yes, and we're very proud of it.
- We're going to be in the record books.
It's not their peach.
The old man gave the green things to me.
- That's what made it grow.
- How dare you disagree with us!
Patience, sister.
Remember his condition.
- His condition?
- He's a chronic liar.
Sad, really.
He needs his treatment.
Well, that's why we're here; to bring him home.
So you come here with us, eh, lovey!
I'm not the one who's lying.
They are!
As you can see, Officer, it is urgent that you release him to us immediately.
Let the boy speak!
- Yeah!
- Yeah! Let the boy speak!
All right! All right! All right!
Let's get to the bottom of this.
This thing is a peach.
All right. I'll buy that.
Now, does somebody want to tell me how it got here?
We attached it to a hundred seagulls.
Seagulls?
That's what happened!
Me and Miss Spider and the centipede and the old green grasshopper.
I think he's gone mad.
This is all something he dreamed up.
Well, maybe it started that way, as a dream, but doesn't everything?
Those buildings, these lights, this whole city!
Somebody had to dream about it first, and maybe that's what I did.
I dreamed about coming here, but then I did it.
- The poor boy needs his medicine.
- Yes.
- So we'll just take him--
- And the peach. back to our cosy, little house on the hill.
Come along.
You're going home with us.
No, I'm not.
What did you say?
I said, "No, I'm not!''
I hate that house and that cold room and how I was always hungry.
All right! That's enough!
- And how you beat me!
- He's lying!
- And told me I was nothing!
- Shut up!
- Shut up!
- Shut up!
- No! Not this time.
I flew the giant peach across the ocean.
I landed on top of the tallest building in the world.
I made it! I'm not the one who's nothing. You are!
And I'm never going back with you!
Not me, and not the peach.
How dare you speak to us this way?
James! Up here!
Hello! We're here!
- Hey, buddy!
- What are they?
- Young James.
- Hey,Jimmy!
- Bugs!
- Need a little help down there?
Giant bugs!
Hey, you old biddies!
- Help us!
- Whoo-ee! Here we are, dear.
Hello,James!
I told you they were real.
- Hello, old boy.
- Requesting clearance to land.
Miss Spider, throw me a string.
Okay. Pull them up.
Help!
Where are we going?
- Spin them around.
- You little--
Wrap them tightly!
Tighter! Tighter!
Well, I'll be a--
The kid was tellin' the truth.
Get those two creeps outta here!
Stop the presses!
I got a new front page!
"Big Bugs In The Big Apple.''
In big, bold print: " A Little
Lindy Flies Giant Peach.''
"Half-Pint Hero
And His Peach-Pit Pals.''
Everyone, these are my friends; the ones I've been telling you about.
- Mr Centipede.
- Hi.
- Old green grasshopper.
- My pleasure.
- Earthworm. Mrs Ladybug.
- Charmed.
Miss Spider. And the glow-worm.
God bless the colonies.
- Could we eat some of your peach?
- It won't keep forever.
Go ahead.
Hey! What was your name?
It's James.
They ate that peach all the way down to the pit... and set it up in Central Park as a permanent home.
And James Henry Trotter, who once was the saddest and loneliest little boy you could find, now had a loving new family... and all the friends in the world.
James, dinner is ready.
All right. Nearly finished.
And since James's visitors begged him again and again... to hear the story of his adventure with the giant peach, he wished for a way to share it with everyone.
And that is exactly what you have just seen.
Once upon a time there was a vulture and a hog
Livin' in a house up on a hill
Had this little boy who lived with them
They worked him like a dog
With any luck they'd have him up there still
'Long came a magic man with a magic bag
Full of nasty little green things in a funky old rag
He said, Boy, you may not know it but this here's salvation you see
Son, you're going down in history
Good news is blowin' in your window
Good news is knockin' on your door
Good news is comin' 'round the corner
Good news is rollin' 'round your floor
Where can all my troubles be
Must be good news chasin' me
Good enough to set everybody free
Good news, good news, good news
Good news
There were bugs in the garden
Didn't have a clue
But every day their life was on the line
They wanted to get out of there but they didn't know what to do
Their little brains was workin' overtime
- Well
- That all changed one sunny day
That little boy dropped by to say
If we all work together we'll make out okay
- We will
- Good news, good news, good news
So they rolled down the mountain flew over the sea
Facin' death and danger on their way
But together they have made it
They're where they want to be
They love each other more and more each day
They care about each other
Good news is sweepin'
'cross the country
Good news is spreadin' all around
Good news is hittin' in the city
Good news has sprung up in the town
The things that used to hurt before
They don't hurt 'em any more
'Cause they know there's somethin' good in store
- Good news
- Good news
- Good news
- Good news
- Good news
- Good news

Porridge today, Gromit!
Tuesday!
Geronimo!
Huh?
Huh? Oh!
Oh! Oh!
Oh, no! No! Turn it off!
Uh, mice, do you think?
I think I'll make my own porridge.
Well, I'll be...
Have you been peckish during the night?
Only someone's been at me cheese.
Well, I don't know.
There's something very fishy going on.
Huh?
Do you think we should get the pest control people in?
Hello, Wallace and Gromit's
Wash 'N' Go
Window Cleaning Service.
May we be of assistance?
Hello.
Yes, my windows could do with a jolly good clean.
The wool shop in the high street.
As soon as you can.
On our way, madam.
Oh!
Need wool, don't you, lad?
Thank you for coming so quickly.
Oh, dear!
Oh, allow me.
Please.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Oh, I'll soon have these cleared up.
It's no trouble.
How embarrassing.
This is Preston, my dog.
All right, pooch?
Won't take a minute.
- Oh--
- Oh.
Well, I...
What was it you wanted?
I...
Ramsbottom,
Wendolene Ramsbottom.
Oh, charming.
I'm Wallace.
The windows.
Is this place yours?
Mm.
My father left it to me...
Along with his debts and a few other things.
He was an inventor.
Never!
Well, I-
I do a bit of that myself.
Oh!
I see that they still haven't caught those sheep rustlers yet.
Still, you've got plenty of wool, eh?
Your dog's waiting.
Aye, I'd better see to him.
The bounce has gone from his bungee.
Oh, they're spanking.
You've done a grand job.
Windows are our specialty.
Let's get that kettle on.
Good grief!
What's all this?
Burglars, thieves?
Oh, what a mess.
I've never seen anything like it.
Heavens above, Gromit.
Look at this.
The little chap must be really hungry.
Oh, come over here, lad.
No need to be sheepish.
We'll have to get you cleaned up.
There.
Nothing to fret over.
Just a quick shampoo.
We've tested this on Gromit.
Haven't we, lad?
Right.
Off we go, then.
Oh, heck!
Baaaa!
Oh!
Baaaaa-aaa-aaa!
Oh, do something, Gromit!
Oh, it's too late now.
Turn it off, Gromit!
Oh! Oh!
Oh, dear.
Oh, brilliant, Gromit.
Oh, smashing, this.
A bit tight here and there.
Baaaa.
Ah, looks okay to me.
We'll call him Shaun, eh?
Hmm?
Come on, Shaun.
Gromit?
You know we're doing the clock tomorrow.
Sorry, Gromit.
That was a bit thick.
Back in a tick, Gromit.
Won't be long.
Just thought I'd pop in...
Tell me about windows.
Well, it's only temporary, you understand.
Oh, really?
Oh, yes.
I'm inventing, mostly.
Only...
Oh, what sort of inventions?
Well, sort of...
Daddy would loved to have met you.
Poor Daddy.
Of all the women I've met... not that there have been many, you understand.
So you see, what I'm trying to say, in a manner of speaking, is...
Of all the ladies
I've met, you...
Oh! Ohhhh! Oh!
The same time next week?
Baa!
Caught bang to rights, you were.
You've really let us down this time, lad.
Hey, give over.
Shoo, shoo!
Go on with you!
I'm sorry about this.
For what?
Nothing.
Just stay away from me, from my shop and my silly, silly windows.
Well, I...
Forget me.
I'm no good for you.
I'm so sorry about Gromit.
Owwww!
Ba!
Oh, Gromit.
Oh, Gromit!
Oh, Gromit.
Brilliant teamwork, lads!
Yeow!
Ahhhh!
I suppose you'll have to skip the country now.
A fugitive, eh?
You'll be hunted down like...
Well, a dog.
Wendo-
Stop it.
Stop it, Preston.
I want no more of this rustling!
Oh! It wasn't so bad when it was just the wool, but this is evil!
Daddy didn't create you for this!
Ouch!
You're supposed to protect me!
Let me out!
You're not going to turn me into dog meat.
Dog meat?
Help!
Don't worry, Wendolene.
I'm on my way!
We've lost them!
Ah!
Oh!
We're at maximum speed!
She won't go any faster.
Oh, heck!
Wallace, help me!
Don't worry, Wendolene!
Everything's under control.
Ow-oh!
Be careful, Shaun!
Hey, steady on!
Single file.
Oh!
Single file, I said.
Oh! Get yourselves organized down there!
Huh?
Watch out, lads!
Oh, no!
Ah! splat!
Where'd you get that from?
That's my machine!
I've got patent pending on that.
Help.
Oh, Shaun!
Help!
Shaun, where's Gromit?
Shaun, do something!
Help!
Attaboy, Gromit!
Well done, Gromit.
That'll teach him.
He's malfunctioning.
Mal what?
Malfunctioning.
Preston is a cyberdog.
A cyber what?
A robot.
Daddy created him for good, but he's turned out evil.
Huh?
Ah, it's a sheep-mincing thing.
Now, that's clever.
Huh?
Oh!
Do something, Wallace.
Baaa!
Duck!
Where?
By heck!
I though we were all for the can then.
I couldn't pass by without saying thank you.
He's just like he used to be.
Oh, don't mention it.
Thanks, pooch.
Give me a shout if he goes wrong again.
You're very kind.
Won't you come in?
We were just about to have some cheese.
Oh, no, not cheese.
Sorry, it brings me out in a rash.
Can't stand the stuff.
Not even Wensleydale?
Got to be on our way.
Come on, Preston.
Good-bye...
Chuck.
What's wrong with Wensleydale?
Talking of which...
All the more for us, and not a sheep to worry us.
Get off me cheese!
Get off! Get off!
Gromit? Gromit!
Go for him! Gromit!
Oh!
Get off with you!
Oh, dear.
Shoo off.

The Land Before Time III
The Time of the Great Giving
A long time ago, at least thirty-five hundred million years ago, the earliest form of life made it's first appearance on earth.
These single-celled creatures developed and grew, and changed a million times over.
Until at last, there was a creature able to leave the sea, and to crawl out into an unknown world.
From this long fish-like creature came hundreds of other animals.
The mightiest of which was called the Dinosaur.
For most of the earth's dinosaurs, life was filled with danger.
But for the fortunate leaf-eating dinosaurs of the Great Valley, life was peaceful, and food plentyful.
The Great Valley was the perfect place for children like Littlefoot, the longneck,
Cera, the threehorn,
Ducky, the swimmer,
Petrie, the flyer, and Spike, the spiketail, to grow and learn and play.
- I got it!
- No, me got it!
Go, Spike.
Did you did it, Spike?
Did you? Huh?
Yep, yep, yep. You got it.
I found an other one.
I found an other one.
Hy, Hyp. Do you hand my rock back, please?
Your rock? Who said it was your rock?
Yeah, who said it was your rock, huh?
Who said? Who said?
Oh. Ah. Yeah!
Well, Gee, no-one, but we were just playing with it.
So give it back, Hyp!
Well, I didn't hear you say:
Please.
That's, because I didn't.
Hey, maybe we can all play, together.
Good idea, Littlefoot.
We all play.
Yep, yep, yep, the more the better.
What do you thing guys?
Wanna play with these... babies?
Babies? Who's he calling babies?
- Us?
- Uh. Me no baby! Me big!
Yeah, big baby!
- Me no like them.
- Me neither.
I'll show 'em!
- Cera!
- I'm busy!
- Come, and get us!
- Yeah, try!
Whow. What's that?
- Its' a...
- Earthshake!
- Rocks flying?!
- Flying rocks!
- Daddy!
- Mama!
Grandma! Grandpa!
Fly children! Fly!
Run!
Littlefoot!
Look out!
- Littlefoot.
- I'm in here, Grandma.
Are you all right, little one?
Would you like to come out now?
Shee, that wasn't a regular kind earthshake, was it?
No, Littlefoot, it wasn't.
- Than what kind was it?
- We don't know, Littlefoot.
Perhaps it had to do with those great rocks, falling from the sky.
Oh, yeah. I saw 'em.
And I saw that big one, landing somewhere in the mysterious beyond.
I sure wish we could go find it.
Yes, that would be an adventure now, wouldn't it?
Well, I think we've had enough adventure for one day.
Come. It's time to settle down for the night.
It's beautiful, isn't it, Grandpa?
Oh, yes, Littlefoot.
Beautiful.
And mysterious.
As is so much in our world.
Well, at least that danger has passed.
- Huh, what? - Look, everyone!
Where did the water go?
- It stopped flowing.
- How can that be?
What will we do without water?
Grandpa? Why did the
Thundering Falls just stop?
I don't know, Littlefoot.
I don't know.
Littlefoot, go and play.
Grandpa and I must talk with the other grown-ups.
Sure, Grandma.
- See you later, Grandpa.
- This's never happened before.
Hey guys!
Guess, what happened to the Thundering Falls!
Sss! We are trying to find Cera.
She has hided from us.
- But...
- Me no find Cera anywhere.
- Guess, what, Petrie!
- What? You no find Cera either?
Cera is a very good hider.
She is.
I scared you!
I scared you! I did!
You no scared me, Cera.
Me unscareable!
Peatrie, you are rubbing my nose.
Oh, huhuh, sorry.
Me no know my own strength.
Now who is going to hide?
Littlefoot?
Okey, but first
I wanna tell you something.
Well, hurry it up!
We wanna play!
I saw a... hey!
Spike is taking your term for you, Littlefoot.
My brother is not a very good hider, oh no.
Now, just what were you gonna say, Littlefoot?
It's the Thundering Falls!
It's not giving us any water!
You gotta come see!
Why don't you hatchlings go run and see?
Yeah, run and see!
Run and see!
Oh! Aa... yeah!
- Try and make us!
- No, Cera, no!
Oh, don't worry!
I won't hurt them. Much.
Put those away!
How come all you ever want to do is fight, Hyp?
Yeah, fight.
Ouh. Fighting hurt.
Yeah. It does give you aue-s,
Hyp. Why do we do it?
Why? Why?
Because we are bigger!
And bigger's smarter!
Bigger is meaner, and bigger is better!
When you're big, you can push all the little ones around, they're looking up, while you are looking down.
You can snap a tree in two, like it's just a twig.
Things are better, when you're big.
When you're big, you can do anything you wanna do.
All the rules the grown-ups make, they don't apply to you.
Just smashing on the puddles, gop and slurp and swig the world is wider, when you're big.
You can snort, you can grunt.
You can stock, you can haul.
You can bug someone smaller on the head.
On the head.
You can take, what you want.
Lay all day in the swamp.
And you never ever have to go to bed.
When you're big, you can step on little peoples toes, lunch on their lunch, bump them in the nose.
Threehorns and longnecks, and duckfeet too.
They all have to do anything you want'em to.
And if they don't, you can plumb them in the gue.
Don't you forget, what you want you get.
Things are better, when you're big.
When you're big.
When you're big.
When you're big.
But Hyp, when you're a grown-up, you won't be very big at all.
Yeah! Your kind never gets very big.
When we grow up, we'll be much bigger.
Aha. Aha, much-much-much-much bigger!
Oh, yeah? Well I'm gonna see to it, that you never grow up.
- Oh, yeah!
- Never grow up, never.
How are we gonna do that, Hyp?
Shee, is he dumb.
Let me lay it out for you.
First we chase 'em, second we catch 'em, third we hurt 'em! See?
No Hyp. I don't see.
- Anybody. - Me neither.
- What?
Come on, haul 'em later.
As you can all see, our valley is quickly drying up.
Yes. We see it, and feel it as well.
There is less and less water to drink.
And green food to eat.
I know. That is why our herds must work together.
To save the little water we have left.
From now on, we must drink only what we need to survive.
And no more.
Hopefully soon the Thundering
Falls will bring us water again.
If not, we may have to leave the Great Valley.
- Leave the Great Valley?
- Never! - It's our home!
Than, until the water returns, we must not use the water we have left unwisely.
Threehorns never use water unwisely. But your herds do!
Our herds? What makes you think, our herds would do such a thing?
You drink greedily with no concern for others.
Can you believe he is saying that?
- Well, I've seen threehorns waste. - What?
You take long baths, even if you are the least bit dirty.
And, I've seen your kind waste, too.
Splashing water needlessly, for shame.
Impossible!
I never did such a thing!
Hey! Let's play bullies!
I'll be Hyp!
- I'm gonna get you!
- Not, if I get you first!
Me wanna play bullies too!
Hey, hatchling, you no eat my green-food!
Me go play bullies someplace else.
Petrie! You're a flyer, not a swimmer!
Me no bully either.
But I am!
- Not again!
- Oh, no-no-no-no-noooo!
It them!
That you hatchlings keep playing in our swimming hole, huh?
They're beginning to get on my nerves.
Can we teach'em a lesson, Hyp?
Huh? Can we, huh?
Be my guest, Nod!
Run!
- See ya!
- Wouldn't wanna be ya!
This is not funny!
Now someone splashed me, and wasted precious water.
Littlefoot, are you all right?
Aha. But I think I'm in trouble.
Your Littlefoot is guilty of wasting water.
What happened, Littlefoot?
It was an accident,
Grandpa! Honest!
I'm sure, it was, Littlefoot.
Our children don't understand the water problem, the Great Valley has always given them everything they need.
What are those grown-ups talking about?
What water problem? Isn't the
Thundering Falls coming back?
I don't know.
Well, it should!
Why wouldn't it?
Maybe it is tired and needs to rest.
We need to teach our children, how to use the remaining water wisely.
Speak for yourself, longneck!
My Cera would never waste!
Your Littlefoot is a bad influence!
That's not true!
- What is influmance?
- Me no know.
Come, Cera!
You're not to play with the little longneck any more.
But, Daddy!
My friend.
I think you're acting rushly.
Littlefoot is not to blame.
- I said, come Cera!
- No!
Cera, I'm your father.
And I know, what's best for you.
- Petrie, it's time to go home!
- Bye-bye! Coming, Mama!
Come Ducky, Spike, you too!
Do not worry, Littlefoot!
You're not an influmance, whatever that is.
I don't understand, Grandpa. Why does Cera's dad think I'm bad?
Oh, he is just confused,
Littlefoot.
Sometimes fear makes grown-ups do strange things.
I don't understand, Daddy!
You need friends, who know how to behave.
Especially in times like this.
Littlefoot is my friend!
He'll always be my friend!
- Cera, I'm your father!
I want, what's best for you!
No, you don't! You just don't want me to have any fun!
Cera, please. I'm just trying to... as a parent I...
Time to wake up, my little one.
Grandma! It's early.
I'm still sleepy.
You must get up, Littlefoot!
If you want to drink the morning dew with us.
The morning dew?
Yes. It collects on the leeves in the early morning.
If we hurry, we can drink the dew, before the bright circle gets too high in the sky and dries it all up.
All right.
Here, Littlefoot, drink this.
I think, you'll find it delicious.
Ups! It broke!
It's not your fault, Littlefoot.
The treestars are very dry now, and crumble easily.
But when will everything be green and wet again, Grandma?
I don't know.
I hope, soon.
But what's going to happen, if it's not soon?
Water will get harder and harder to find.
Soon, everything will be as dry as that treestar.
- And it will be easier for fires to start. - Fire?
Yes, Littlefoot. Which is why you must remember the escape paths, we've shown you.
Don't worry, Grandma.
I'll remember.
I think, we're in luck.
There is still quite a few green treestars left here.
Come on, then! Let's eat!
Yeah, let's eat!
These don't look too good.
But I sure am hungry.
They taste terrible!
Here, Littlefoot. Try these!
They're still very green.
- Thanks, Grandpa!
- Go on, Littlefoot. Eat up!
But, but what about you?
Don't you want some?
Thank you, Littlefoot.
But Grandpa and I will be fine.
Yes. You're still growing, you need the very best green food, we can find.
Well, okey.
That was good!
But sure I am thirsty.
When is it our turn for water?
Our turn for water is when the bright circle touches the Smoking Mountain.
But if you're thirsty,
I think you can have a drink now.
After all, we never agreed that the children should have the same water restrictions as the elders.
Oh, boy! Water!
It's not your time to drink, longnecks!
What do you mean, not our time?
We agreed, that all herds must take terms drinking at the watering hole.
Yes, we all agreed, but I didn't think, that it included the children.
It really isn't fair to them.
There is no fair, when it comes to survival.
When life is tough, you got to be tougher, if you wanna stay alive!
When the trail gets rough, you got to get rougher, to help your family survive.
You can run around in circles, wondering what to do.
Someone's got to be the boys a reason, is it you, or you, or you?
When things around us are going bad, we all better be strong.
We could loose everything we've had, if this goes on too long.
Don't stand around here talking!
I say, that's not enough!
No tears, no sighs, don't close your eyes!
We got to stand tough!
I used to hear my father say:
Stand and fight, don't run away!
He made me, what I am today,
I'm here!
And I'm tough!
When times are hard, you better be harder, you don't know what's in store.
You think, you're smart?
You got to be smarter, than you ever were before.
You say, I'm mean, you say, if I bother, but I have a daughter and I'm her father.
I'm gonna make sure, we all have water enough.
That's why I'm tough!
I'm standing tough!
We got to stand tough!
You don't like it? Tough!
Littlefoot! Over here!
You judge us wrongly, threehorn.
I'm only doing, what needs to be done.
But this is going too far!
What are we gonna do about the grown-ups, Littlefoot?
- They're acting like babies!
- I know.
And it's all the
Thundering Falls's fault, too.
If we had more water, this wouldn't be happening.
- That's it, Cera!
- What's it?
Water!
If we find some, the grown-ups will stop being mad.
Maybe. Except for my Dad.
He is always mad.
Yeah. He is kind'a grumpy.
But I'm sure it's just because he is so worried about the water.
Yeah. Anyway, let's go get
Petrie, Ducky and Spike and find some water.
- How about a compromise?
- No. We must be firm.
Can't we agree on anything?
- Are we all here?
- Yep-yep-yep. Here. All here.
Oh, no. We are not.
Where is Spike?
Well, don't ask me!
He is not my brother.
Oh, Spike! Where are you, little brother?
What that?
It sound like monster.
Do not worry, Petrie!
That is not a monster!
That is Spike!
Spike?
That is his sleeping sound.
Come on, I'll show you.
See?
You are right, Ducky.
Get up, silly. This is not nap-time. This is get up-time.
You wake up now, okey Spike?
Huh! Spike up!
Spike down.
Spike, no!
- Are you okey, Petrie?
- Aha. Spike sure heavy sleeper.
We gotta wake him up, because it's gonna take all of us to find more water.
Water? Yes!
Me help find water!
Spike, stop!
Me no find water yet.
Don't worry, Spike!
We find it, I just know we will.
We'd better!
Because if our parents stay mad any longer,
I'm just gonna scream!
- Oh, I will scream too!
- Petrie good screamer!
What about you, Spike?
- How we find water, Littlefoot?
- We smell for it, silly.
Oh, yes! Smell for it, with our noses.
I know how to do that.
No smell so hard, okey, Spike?
- This is serious, Ducky.
- Oh, yes, Cera. I know. I know.
It's not your turn!
Go on!
My sniffer is very-very sniffed out.
Well, I'm so thirsty,
I could drink a lake.
Me too, if we could find one.
Funny. Me smell water, but me no see water.
- Did you hear a...a splash?
- Aha. - Water!
That is so good!
Oh, yes. This is the yummiest water ever. It is!
And we drink all we want, no-one yelling us.
There they are. And would you look, what they've found for us.
What is it?
Hi, ya, hatchlings.
Say bye-bye, water.
Why?
Is it going somewhere?
No, but you are!
- This is our water now!
- So give it back!
Give back?
But it already in my tummy.
But do you not want to share?
- We don't share with anybody.
Do we? - No, not. - Nobody.
So I'm warning you, small fries, if you tell anybody else about this water, you'll be very-very sorry!
We are telling. And you better not try to stop us!
Hurry!
Hurry! Can't let them tell!
What am I running for?
I'm not afraid of those.
Hey! What's the big idea?
No time to fight bully, Cera.
We go tell grown-ups about water.
Where'd they go, Hyp, huh?
Where'd they go?
If I knew,
I wouldn't be looking for 'em.
- Yeah!
- Yeah, dummy!
Aaaa!
Keep running!
Are they still after us?
Me no know.
Me too scared to look.
Spike, you're going the wrong way!
Hurray! Now you're on the right way!
Why are we going this way anyway, Littlefoot?
We're tired, and this way is hard!
Because this is the shortest way back to the grown-ups.
And it will be harder for the bullies to follow us.
It is the mysterious beyond!
And it have water!
Whole bunches!
The flying rocks must have caused slides in the mysterious beyond too.
Yeah! And those dumb slides blocked our barwater.
Come on! The grown-ups will know what to do.
Bad weather for flying.
Lookout!
Not this way!
I know an other path.
That's enough. You've had your share for today.
- The threehorn is getting far too bossy. - I agree.
- Grandpa! Grandma!
- Daddy!
Fire!
There's fire in the valley!
Are you sure,
Littlefoot?
Yes, Grandpa.
It's near to border pass.
Yes, we can see the fire signs from here.
The border pass?
- That's close to here.
- We must run.
Calm yourselves.
We will lead you to safety.
No, I will. We will be better off, following me.
This way!
Come!
But you're heading down-wind, where the fire will surely spread.
We must go up-wind of the fire.
Do as you will, longneck, but Cera and I go this way. Come, Cera.
But Daddy!
The others can do what they want, but you are my daughter, and you'll do as I say.
I'm... 'm...
I'm going with my father.
I do not feel good about this.
Oh, no. I do not.
Grandma! Grandpa!
Can't you stop them?
I have to go after 'em!
Yes. Littlefoot, you come with me.
We'll lead the others to safety.
But what about everybody else in the valley, Grandma?
What will happen to them?
They'll use the escape routes closest to them. Now come.
Everyone! Follow me!
Children first!
Cera!
Grandma!
What's wrong?
The smoke is too thick.
You'll have to lead.
But I...
Follow me, everyone!
- Where is he?
- I can't see!
Littlefoot! The grown-ups cannot see good. They cannot.
They can hear.
Follow my voice!
Stay close to the one in front of you!
Keep you heads down, it's not much further.
- Are you sure, this is right,
Daddy? - Of course I'm sure!
- Daddy!
- This way, Cera!
We're trapped!
Threehorns! Over here!
Hurry, Cera!
- Are you all right, Cera?
- Yes, Daddy.
Come!
Grandpa!
- They made it! I was so worried!
- I'm fine, dear, really.
How is everyone else?
Our group got here safely.
Thanks to Littlefoot.
Oh, yes.
Thanks to Littlefoot.
We are all very lucky.
Lucky? How can you say we are lucky, when our valley burns?
We are without water, and now we are without a home.
All is lost.
All is not lost, my friend.
You still have Cera.
And you are still here.
Able to care for her.
Well, you are right.
Thank you longneck.
But the threehorn speaks the truth.
We don't.
We'll never be able to go back to the Great Valley.
Never go back to the
Great Valley? Oh, no!
The water! We forgot to tell them about the water!
Grandma! Grandpa!
We found water!
- Water?
- Where, Littlefoot?
- It's stuck!
- Behind the Thundering Falls.
- The flying rocks did it.
- They did.
Which means, the water is trapped in the mysterious beyond.
The mysterious beyond.
- We can't go there!
- It's dangerous!
Of course it's dangerous!
But no place is safe now.
We must go and free the water!
But such a huge gathering place of water will attract other creatures besides ourselves.
In the mysterious beyond, there'll be sharp-teeth.
Sharp-teeth?!
I do not like sharp-teeth.
Oh, no!
Their teeth are too sharp.
Still, we must do something!
We must come up with a plan to free the water!
I have a plan!
I hope it's better than your fire-escape plan.
Please!
This is no time to argue.
At least I had a plan!
Stop!
You're acting like children!
We no act like that!
- I have a plan, too.
- Mine's better.
I sure would like to get to that water first, before the rest of those dummies go slubbering in it.
But you heard the grown-ups, Hyp.
- What about sharp-teeth?
- What about them?
You tell'm, Mutt!
Well, they're bad. Yeah!
And scary too.
Come on! You are just as afraid as we are!
Me?
I'm not afraid of anything.
- Bet, you are!
- Bet, I'm not!
You were afraid of those big flying rocks!
I was not! I just ran, because you guys did.
I... I dind't want you to feel stupid.
Well, than prove it!
All right, I will! I'll get me some tasty water, and you babies can stay here!
- I'm not a baby!
- Me neither!
- Hyp! Wait!
- Ah, yeah. For us!
- We must act now!
- We must not act rushly.
They are so dumb!
Didn't they hear what the grown-ups said about sharp-teeth?
I guess not.
Well if they get eaten, it'll just serve them right.
- Cera! That is not nice!
- I don't care! They deserve it!
I don't know, you guys, maybe we should do something.
Like what?
Like... tell their parents where they went?
All of our parents 're too busy arguing.
Your plan is too dangerous.
- Yours is no better!
- Then listen to mine!
Yours? Don't be silly!
Then... maybe we should go stop them!
- Stop them?
- Us?
They hate us.
They will not listen.
- I know, they're bigger.
- But definitely not smarter!
- Still we have to try!
- But why?
They have feelings, just like we do.
They have problems too.
We think, because they're big, they don't. But they do.
They're louder and they're stronger, and they make a bigger foss.
But way down deep inside,
I think,
They're kids like us.
They have parents just like ours who tell them what to do.
They have feet and tails and horns and skins and noses too.
And when the earth is shaking, they run and hide, because even if the think they're tough, they're still kids like us.
It's just too dangerous,
Littlefoot.
Yes, it is.
- And the're too mean.
- Very, very mean!
Maybe when you're bigger, you think you should pretend, you're not afraid of scary things, that you don't need a friend.
But they're just kids in trouble.
They need some-one to trust.
If we can't bring them home, show them they're not alone.
That they're just kids.
Kids like us.
I just have to try and stop'em.
You guys do what you want.
Last one to go is a scary egg!
Me no scary egg!
Wait for us!
We're not scary eggs either!
Are you sure, this is the right way to the water, Hyp?
Sure I'm sure!
I'm just taking us this special way.
So we don't run into any stupid sharp-teeth.
Wait for me!
Come on, guys! Wait!
Stop whining, Mutt!
This is easy!
Well, what do you know?
A little watering hole.
Just for me!
You guys can have some.
If I leave any.
Huh-uh! Water!
I'm sinking! I'm sinking!
Don't you stand there, pull me out!
- Oh, yeah!
- Right. What do we do?
I don't know.
What do you think we should do?
Somebody do something!
Help! Help!
That's Hyp!
Get me out!
Get me out!
- You pull him out!
- What if I get stuck?
- Then I'll pull you out, okey?
- What if you get stuck..
He's stuck in a tarpit.
Stop moving Hyp! It will only make you sink faster.
We'll have to pull him out.
Everybody line up!
Okey. When me say pull.
- Hey! You're squitching me!
- I'm sorry.
Petrie! Pull!
Are you, are you okey, Hyp?
Are you?
Of course I'm okey.
I was never not okey.
He big fat fibber.
Yeah! We helped you and you know it!
I don't need anybody's help!
Not now, not ever!
But everyone needs help some time! They do.
Help!
There they are!
Littlefoot.
This is no time to go exploring.
Didn't you realise you wandered into the mysterious beyond?
We weren't exploring, Grandpa!
We were trying to stop the bullies...
I... I mean
Hyp and his friends, or they might've got hurt.
Hyp. Here we are chasing after you, when we should be finding a way to free the water.
I thought I told you to stay where it was safe!
Don't look at me that way!
I'm your father and
I know what's best for you.
Yelling is no way to teach your child what is right, or to show that you care.
- How would you know?
- I know, because... because I have a daughter, and I yell at her too much.
Especially when
I'm worried for her safety.
You don't have to worry about me,
Daddy.
If you always react with anger, that's all, your son will know.
And that's all, he'll be able to express to others.
What?
I know now, that we can't live together that way.
With such anger between us.
Our kids found water, because they worked together.
Now we must work together, too.
At last, we all agree.
What's the matter with you?
Nothing.
Except I think we're in trouble.
Yeah.
So what else is new?
That!
And that!
Children! Stay behind me!
- And me!
- Gonna stay too.
Littlefoot! You and your friends, run to safety!
Trough here, kids!
Follow me!
- Grandpa!
- Don't look back! Come on!
We can't let them pass!
They've gone after the children!
Stay close!
We're going to get home!
Stop, where you are, sharp-teeth!
- They're leaving!
- Yes, but why?
Something bad is happening up there.
Stop, you babies!
Me first!
Look!
- Oh, no! Daddy!
- Grandpa!
You kids get to the top of that dam, where it's safer.
But what about the grown-ups?
Just get out of here!
I'll handle this!
Come on!
Why's your dad risking his neck.
- Yeah, what a dumb!
- He is not!
Dad!
- Na-na! Can't get me!
- Son?
The grown-ups are all right!
I'm out of here!
That serve sharp-tooth right.
- He bigger bully than you.
- Hey, watch it!
Come on!
Let's get on'em more rocks!
Are you nuts?
By the time you punch that, those sharp-teeth would be picking the teeth with our toes.
We got to try.
Move over, hatchlings.
This isn't gonna work.
Hyp!
Forget him, Littlefoot!
He is a creep.
Who are you calling, mate?
Get in there and help, you creeps.
Okey, everybody!
Let's get them!
We did it!
Leave our children alone!
We've got to stop the fighting!
Then let's squash those sharp-teeth once and for all.
Look! Water!
We've unlocked the water!
Run!
Looks like you and your friends saved the day, Littlefoot.
I think, we all did,
Grandpa.
Spike likes you now.
He does.
And so, with the return of the water, the Great Valley dinosaurs were able to go home again.
But the home they returned to, wasn't the same.
Fire had destroyed much of their green food.
But instead of giving into despair, the dinosaurs divided into groups, to find the spots, where green food still grew.
Hey, everybody!
We found more!
Did you hear that?
More green food!
How wonderful!
Where?
I mean...Where, son?
Over the canyon.
Not far from here, Pap.
If we share, this should be enough for everyone.
Are you feeling okey, Hyp?
You're talking about sharing.
Oh, yeah, sharing.
I know that.
Not sharing is for scary eggs.
Right?
Right!
Sharing is good.
Yep-yep-yep!
Come on.
Everybody follow us!
And so, as it turned out, the dinosaurs travelled from green spot to green spot.
Eating their fill,
Each helping the others to find what they needed.
Each learning the special kind of joy, which comes from giving to others.
And in the years to come, this story of sharing was told over and over again.
Until it became known, as
The Time of the Great Giving sub by Leonóra Németh
Directed by
Roy Allen Smith
Once upon a time in a faraway land... a young prince lived in a shining castle.
Although he had everything his heart desired... the prince was spoiled, selfish and unkind.
But then, one winter's night... an old beggar woman came to the castle... and offered him a single rose... in return for shelter from the bitter cold.
Repulsed by her haggard appearance... the prince sneered at the gift and turned the old woman away.
But she warned him not to be deceived by appearances... for beauty is found within.
And when he dismissed her again, the old woman's ugliness melted away... to reveal a beautiful enchantress.
The prince tried to apologize, but it was too late... for she had seen that there was no love in his heart.
And as punishment, she transformed him into a hideous beast... and placed a powerful spell on the castle and all who lived there.
Ashamed of his monstrous form... the beast concealed himself inside his castle... with a magic mirror as his only window to the outside world.
The rose she had offered... was truly an enchanted rose... which would bloom until his 21 st year.
If he could learn to love another... and earn her love in return by the time the last petal fell... then the spell would be broken.
If not, he would be doomed... to remain a beast for all time.
As the years passed... he fell into despair and lost all hope... for who could ever learn to love a beast?
Little town
It's a quiet village
Every day like the one before
Little town full of little people
Waking up to say
There goes the baker with his tray like always
The same old bread and rolls to sell
Every morning just the same
Since the morning that we came
- To this poor provincial town
- Good morning, Belle.
- Morning, monsieur.
- Where you off to?
The bookshop. I just finished the most wonderful story...
- about a beanstalk and an ogre and...
- That's nice.
Marie, the baguettes!
Hurry up!
Look, there she goes
The girl is strange, no question
Dazed and distracted
Can't you tell
- Never part of any crowd
- 'Cause her head's up on some cloud
No denying she's a funny girl that Belle
- Bonjour
- Good day
How is your family
- Bonjour
- Good day
How is your wife
- I need six eggs
- That's too expensive
There must be more than this provincial life
- Ah, Belle!
- Good morning.
- I've come to return the book I borrowed.
- Finished already?
Oh, I couldn't put it down.
Have you got anything new?
Not since yesterday.
That's all right.
I'll borrow this one.
That one?
But you've read it twice!
Well, it's my favourite!
Far-off places... daring sword fights, magic spells, a prince in disguise.
If you like it all that much, it's yours.
- But, sir!
- I insist.
Well, thank you.
Thank you very much.
Look, there she goes
That girl is so peculiar
I wonder if she's feeling well
- With a dreamy, far-off look
- And her nose stuck in a book
What a puzzle to the rest of us is Belle
Oh
Isn't this amazing
It's my favourite part
Because you'll see
Here's where she meets Prince Charming
But she won't discover that it's him
Till chapter three
Hey-hey!
Hey-hey-hey!
Now it's no wonder that her name means beauty
Her looks have got no parallel
But behind that fair facade
I'm afraid she's rather odd
Very different from the rest of us
She's nothing like the rest of us
Yes, different from the rest of us is Belle
Wow! You didn't miss a shot, Gaston!
- You're the greatest hunter in the whole world!
- I know.
No beast alive stands a chance against you...
- and no girl, for that matter.
- It's true, Lefou.
And I've got my sights set on that one.
- The inventor's daughter?
- She's the one!
- The lucky girl I'm going to marry.
- But she...
- The most beautiful girl in town.
- I know, but...
That makes her the best!
- And don't I deserve the best?
- Well, of course! I mean, you do!
Right from the moment when I met her, saw her
I said she's gorgeous and I fell
Here in town there's only she
Who is beautiful as me
So I'm making plans to woo and marry Belle
Look, there he goes
Isn't he dreamy
Monsieur Gaston
Oh, he's so cute
Be still my heart
I'm hardly breathing
He's such a tall, dark, strong and handsome brute
- Bonjour
- Good day
- You call this bacon
- What lovely grapes
- Some cheese
- Ten yards
- Excuse me - I'll get the knife - Please let me through
- This bread, it's stale - Those fish, they smell - Madame's mistaken
There must be more than this provincial life
Just watch, I'm going to make Belle my wife
Look, there she goes, a girl who's strange but special
A most peculiar mademoiselle
It's a pity and a sin
She doesn't quite fit in
'Cause she really is a funny girl
A beauty but a funny girl
She really is a funny girl
That Belle
- Hello, Belle.
- Bonjour, Gaston.
Gaston, may I have my book, please?
How can you read this?
There's no pictures!
Well, some people use their imagination.
Belle, it's about time you got your head out of those books... and paid attention to more important things.
Like me.
The whole town's talking about it.
It's not right for a woman to read.
Soon she starts getting ideas and thinking.
- Gaston, you are positively primeval.
- Why, thank you, Belle.
What do you say you and me take a walk over to the tavern...
- and take a look at my trophies?
- Maybe some other time.
- What's wrong with her? -
She's crazy. - He's gorgeous!
Please, Gaston, I can't.
I have to get home to help my father.
Goodbye.
That crazy old loon!
He needs all the help he can get.
Don't talk about my father that way!
Yeah! Don't talk about her father that way!
My father is not crazy.
He's a genius!
- Papa?
- How on earth did that happen?
- Doggone it!
- Are you all right, Papa?
I- I'm a... I'm about ready to give up on this hunk of junk.
- You always say that.
- I mean it this time!
I'll never get this boneheaded contraption to work!
Yes, you will, and you'll win first prize at the fair tomorrow.
- Hmph!
- And become a world-famous inventor.
- You really believe that?
- I always have.
Well, what are we waitin' for?
I'll have this thing fixed in no time.
Hand me that... the... the... the dog-legged clincher there.
So, did you have a good time in town today?
I got a new book.
Papa, do you think I'm odd?
My daughter? Odd?
Where would you get an idea like that?
Oh, I don't know. It's just that
I'm not sure I fit in here.
There's no one I can really talk to.
What about that Gaston?
H- He's a handsome fella.
He's handsome, all right, and rude and conceited and...
- Oh, Papa, he's not for me.
- Well, don't you worry...
'cause this invention's gonna be the start of a new life for us.
I think that's done it.
Now, let's give it a try.
- It works!
- It does?
- It does!
- You did it!
You really did it!
Hitch up Philippe, girl.
I'm off to the fair!
Goodbye, Papa.
Good luck!
Goodbye, Belle.
Take care while I'm gone.
We should be there by now.
Maybe we missed a turn.
I guess I should've taken...
Wait a minute.
No. Let's go this way.
Come on, Philippe, it's a short cut.
We'll be there in no time.
This can't be right.
Where have you taken us, Philippe?
We better turn around.
Whoa. Whoa, boy.
Whoa, now, whoa, Philippe.
Oh! Oh!
Look out! No!
Whoa!
Whoa, boy!
Back up, back up, back up!
Good boy! Good boy.
That's good, that's... Back up!
Steady, steady, now.
Steady.
Steady. No, Philippe!
Philippe?
Oh.
Help!
Is... Is someone there?
Help!
Oh!
Wha... Oh!
Hello?
Hello!
Poor fellow must have lost his way in the woods.
Keep quiet.
Maybe he'll go away.
Is someone there?
Not a word, Lumiere.
Not one word!
I- I don't mean to intrude, but I've lost my horse... and... and I need a place to stay for the night.
Oh, Cogsworth, have a heart.
Shh!
O- O-Ow! Ow! Ow!
Of course, monsieur, you are welcome here.
Who said that?
Over here.
- Where?
- Hello.
Incredible!
Well, now you've done it, Lumiere.
Splendid! Just peachy!
- How is this accomplished?
- Put me down at once!
Stop that! Hee-hee-hee.
Stop that, I say!
Sir, close that at once!
- Do you mind?
- I-I beg your pardon?
It's... It's just that I've never seen a clock that...
Oh, you are soaked to the bone, monsieur.
Come.
Warm yourself by the fire.
- Thank you.
- No, no, no!
You know what the master will do if he finds him here.
I demand that you stop right there!
Oh, no, no!
Not the master's chair!
I'm not seeing this!
I'm not seeing this!
Well, hello there, boy.
- Oh, what service!
- All right!
This has gone far enough.
I'm in charge here...
Ah, would you like a spot of tea, sir?
It'll warm you up in no time.
No! No tea. No tea!
His mustache tickles, Mama!
Oh! Hello!
Uh-oh.
There's a stranger here.
Master, allow me to explain.
The gentleman was lost in the woods.
He was cold and wet, so...
Master, I'd like to take this moment to say...
I was against this from the start.
It was all his fault.
I tried to stop them.
Would they listen to me? No, no...
Who are you?
What are you doing here?
I- I-I was lost in the woods and...
- You are not welcome here!
- I-I-I'm sorry.
- What are you staring at?
- N-Nothing.
So, you've come to stare at the beast, have you?
Please, I meant no harm!
I- I just needed a place to stay.
- I'll give you a place to stay!
- No, no, please! No! No!
Oh, boy. Belle's gonna get the surprise of her life, huh, Gaston?
Yep, this is her lucky day.
I'd like to thank you all for coming to my wedding.
First I better go in there and propose to the girl.
And you, Lefou, now, when
Belle and I come out that door...
Oh, I know! I know!
I- I strike up the band!
- Not yet!
- Sorry.
Oh!
Gaston, what a pleasant surprise.
Isn't it, though?
I'm just full of surprises.
You know, Belle, there's not a girl in town who wouldn't love to be in your shoes.
This is the day...
This is the day your dreams come true.
What do you know about my dreams, Gaston?
Plenty!
Here. Picture this.
A rustic hunting lodge, my latest kill roasting on the fire... and my little wife massaging my feet... while the little ones play on the floor with the dogs.
- We'll have six or seven.
- Dogs?
No, Belle.
- Strapping boys like me.
- Imagine that.
- Do you know who that little wife will be?
- Let me think.
- You, Belle.
- Gaston, I'm...
I'm speechless.
I really don't know what to say.
- Say you'll marry me.
- I'm very sorry, Gaston, but... but I just don't deserve you!
So, how'd it go?
I'll have Belle for my wife.
Make no mistake about that.
Touchy!
Is he gone?
Can you imagine?
He asked me to marry him.
Me, the wife of that boorish, brainless...
Madame Gaston
Can't you just see it
Madame Gaston his little wife
No, sir, not me
I guarantee it
I want much more than this provincial life
I want adventure in the great wide somewhere
I want it more than I can tell
And for once it might be grand
To have someone understand
I want so much more than they've got planned
Philippe! What are you doing here? Where's...
Where's Papa? Where is he, Philippe?
What happened?
Oh, we have to find him.
You have to take me to him.
What is this place?
Philippe, please, steady.
Steady.
Papa!
Couldn't keep quiet, could we?
Just had to invite him to stay, didn't we?
Serve him tea, sit in the master's chair.
- Pet the pooch!
- I was trying to be hospitable.
Hello?
Is anyone here?
Hello?
Papa? Papa?
Are you here?
Mama, there's a girl in the castle.
Now, Chip, I'll not have you making up such wild stories.
Really, Mama.
I saw her.
- Not another word. Into the tub.
- But... What...
A girl!
I saw a girl in the castle!
See, I told ya!
Irresponsible, devil-may-care, waxy eared, slack-jawed...
Papa?
Did you see that?
- It's a girl!
- I know it's a girl.
Don't you see? She's the one!
The girl we have been waiting for!
- She has come to break the spell!
- Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
Papa?
Hello?
Is someone here?
Wait!
I'm looking for my father. I...
That's funny.
I'm sure there was someone.
I- Is anyone here?
- Belle?
- Papa!
- H-H-How did you find me?
- Oh, your hands are like ice.
- We have to get you out of there.
- Belle, I want you to leave this place.
- Who's done this to you?
- No time to explain.
- You must go. Now!
- I won't leave you.
- What are you doing here?
- Run, Belle!
- Who's there? Who are you?
- The master of this castle.
I've come for my father.
Please let him out.
- Can't you see he's sick?
- Then he shouldn't have trespassed here!
But he could die.
Please, I'll do anything.
There's nothing you can do.
He's my prisoner.
Oh, there must be some way
I can... Wait!
- Take me instead.
- You?
You would take his place?
Belle, no! You don't know what you're doing!
If I did, would you let him go?
Yes, but you must promise to stay here forever.
Come into the light.
No, Belle!
I won't let you do this!
- You have my word.
- Done!
No, Belle, listen to me.
I'm old. I've lived my life.
- Wait! -
Belle! - Wait!
No! Please spare my daughter.
Please!
She's no longer your concern.
Take him to the village.
Let me out.
Please let me out!
Let me out!
Please! Please!
- Master?
- What?
Uh, since the girl is going to be with us for quite some time...
I was thinking that you might want to offer her a more comfortable room.
Then again, maybe not.
You didn't even let me say goodbye.
I'll never see him again.
- I didn't get to say goodbye.
- I'll show you to your room.
My room?
But I thought...
- You wanna... You wanna stay in the tower?
- No.
Then follow me.
- Say something to her.
- Huh? Oh.
I, uh, hope you like it here.
The castle is your home now, so you can go anywhere you like except the west wing.
- What's in the west...
- It's forbidden!
Now, if you need anything, my servants will attend you.
Dinner. Invite her to dinner.
You will join me for dinner.
That's not a request!
Who does she think she is? That girl has tangled with the wrong man.
- No one says no to Gaston!
- Darn right!
Dismissed! Rejected!
Publicly humiliated!
Why, it's more than I can bear.
- More beer?
- What for? Nothing helps.
- I'm disgraced.
- Who, you? Never!
Gaston, you've got to pull yourself together.
Gosh, it disturbs me to see you, Gaston
Looking so down in the dumps
Every guy here'd love to be you, Gaston
Even when taking your lumps
There's no man in town as admired as you
You're everyone's favourite guy
Everyone's awed and inspired by you
And it's not very hard
To see why
No one's
Slick as Gaston
No one's quick as Gaston
No one's neck's as incredibly thick as Gaston
For there's no man in town half as manly
Perfect
A pure paragon
You can ask any
Tom, Dick or Stanley
And they'll tell you whose team they prefer to be on
No one's
Been like Gaston a kingpin like Gaston
No one's got a swell cleft in his chin like Gaston
As a specimen yes, I'm intimidating
My, what a guy that Gaston
Give 5 hurrahs
Give 12 hip-hips
Gaston is the best and the rest is all drips
No one
Fights like Gaston
Douses lights like Gaston
In a wrestling match nobody bites like Gaston
For there's no one as burly and brawny
As you see
I've got biceps to spare
- Not a bit of him scraggly or scrawny
- That's right!
And every last inch of me's covered with hair
- No one hits like Gaston
- Matches wits like Gaston
In a spitting match nobody spits like Gaston
I'm especially good at expectorating
- Ptooey!
- Ten points for Gaston
When I was a lad
I ate four dozen eggs
Every morning to help me get large
And now that I'm grown
I eat five dozen eggs
So I'm roughly the size of a barge
No one
Shoots like Gaston
Makes those beauts like Gaston
Then goes tromping around wearing boots like Gaston
I use antlers in all of my decorating
My, what a guy
Gaston
- Help! Someone help me!
- Maurice?
Please! Please, I need your help.
He's got her... He's got her locked in the dungeon!
- Who?
- Belle. We must go.
Not... Not a minute to lose.
Whoa! Slow down, Maurice.
Who's got Belle locked in a dungeon?
A beast!
A horrible, monstrous beast!
- Is it a big beast?
- Huge!
- With a long, ugly snout?
- Hideously ugly!
- And sharp, cruel fangs?
- Yes, yes! Will you help me?
All right, old man.
We'll help you out.
You will? Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you!
Crazy old Maurice.
He's always good for a laugh.
Crazy old Maurice, hmm?
Crazy old Maurice. Hmm.
Lefou, I'm afraid
I've been thinking
- A dangerous pastime
- I know
But that wacky old coot is Belle's father
And his sanity's only so-so
Now, the wheels in my head have been turning
Since I looked at that loony old man
See, I promised myself
I'd be married to Belle
And right now
I'm evolving a plan
- If I...
- Yes?
- Then we...
- No, would she?
- Guess!
- Now I get it!
- Let's go!
- Let's go!
No one
Plots like Gaston
Takes cheap shots like Gaston
Plans to persecute harmless crackpots like Gaston
So his marriage we soon will be celebrating
My, what a guy
Gaston
Will no one help me?
- Who is it?
- Mrs Potts, dear.
I thought you might like a spot of tea.
But you're...
You're a...
- Oh! Careful.
- This is impossible!
I know it is, but here we are.
I told you she was pretty, Mama, didn't I?
All right, Chip, now, that'll do.
Slowly now.
- Don't spill.
- Thank you.
Wanna see me do a trick?
- Chip!
- Oops, sorry.
That was a very brave thing you did, my dear.
- We all think so.
- But I've lost my father... my dreams, everything.
Cheer up, child.
It'll turn out all right in the end.
You'll see.
Oh, listen to me... jabberin' on while there's a supper to get on the table.
- Chip?
- Bye!
Well, now, what shall we dress you in for dinner?
Oh, let's see what I got in my drawers.
Oh, how embarrassing!
Ahem.
Ah, here we are!
You'll look ravishing in this one!
That's very kind of you, but I'm not going to dinner.
Ah, but you must!
Ahem, ahem, ahem, ahem, ahem.
Dinner is served.
What's taking so long?
I told her to come down.
- Why isn't she here yet?
- Oh, try to be patient, sir.
The girl has lost her father and her freedom all in one day.
Master, have you thought that perhaps... this girl could be the one to break the spell?
Of course I have!
I'm not a fool.
Good!
So, you fall in love with her... she falls in love with you, and poof!
The spell is broken.
We'll be human again by midnight.
Oh, it's not that easy, Lumiere.
These things take time.
But the rose has already begun to wilt.
Oh, it's no use.
She's so beautiful and I'm...
Well, look at me!
Oh, you must help her to see past all that.
I don't know how.
Well, you can start by making yourself more presentable.
Straighten up.
Try to act like a gentleman.
Ah, yes. When she comes in, give her a dashing, debonair smile.
Come, come.
Show me the smile.
- But don't frighten the poor girl.
- Impress her with your rapier wit.
But be gentle.
- Shower her with compliments.
- But be sincere.
And above all, you must control your temper!
Here she is!
Good evening.
Well, where is she?
Who? Oh, ha ha ha!
The girl, yes. The girl.
Well, actually, she's in the process of...
Circumstances being what they are...
Uh, she's not coming.
What!
Oh, dear. Your Grace!
Your Eminence!
Let's not be hasty!
- I thought I told you to come down to dinner!
- I'm not hungry.
You'll come out or I'll... I'll...
I'll break down the door!
Master, I could be wrong, but that may not be... the best way to win the girl's affections.
Please attempt to be a gentleman.
But she is being so difficult.
Gently, gently.
- Will you come down to dinner?
- No!
Suave, genteel.
It would give me great pleasure... if you would join me for dinner.
And we say please.
- Please.
- No, thank you.
- You can't stay in there forever!
- Yes, I can.
Fine! Then go ahead and starve!
If she doesn't eat with me, then she doesn't eat at all!
Oh, dear. That didn't go very well at all, did it?
Lumiere, stand watch at the door... and inform me at once if there is the slightest change.
You can count on me, mon capitaine.
Well, we might as well go downstairs and start cleaning up.
I ask nicely, but she refuses.
Wh-Wh-What...
What does she want me to do, beg?
Show me the girl.
But the master's really not so bad once you get to know him.
- Why don't you give him a chance?
- I don't want to get to know him.
I don't want to have anything to do with him.
I'm just fooling myself.
She'll never see me as anything... but a monster.
It's hopeless.
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes, yes, yes!
I've been burnt by you before.
Zut alors!
She has emerged!
Come on, Chip. Into the cupboard with your brothers and sisters.
But I'm not sleepy.
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not.
I work and I slave all day long, and for what?
A culinary masterpiece gone to waste!
Oh, stop your grousing.
It's been a long night for all of us.
Well, if you ask me, she was just being stubborn!
After all, he did say please.
But if the master doesn't learn to control that temper, he'll never break the...
Splendid to see you out and about, mademoiselle.
I am Cogsworth, head of the household.
- This is Lumiere.
- Enchanté, chérie.
If there's... stop that... anything we... please... can do... to make your stay more comfortable...
- I am a little hungry.
- You are?
Hear that?
She's hungry!
Stoke the fire. Break out the silver.
Wake the china.
Remember what the master said.
Oh, pish tosh! I'm not about to let the poor child go hungry.
All right, fine. Glass of water, crust of bread and then...
Cogsworth,
I am surprised at you!
She's not a prisoner.
She's our guest!
We must make her feel welcome here.
Right this way, mademoiselle.
Well, keep it down.
If the master finds out about this, it will be our necks.
Of course, of course.
But what is dinner without a little music?
Music?
It is with deepest pride and greatest pleasure... that we welcome you tonight.
And now we invite you to relax.
Let us pull up a chair as the dining room proudly presents... your dinner.
Be our guest
Be our guest
Put our service to the test
Tie your napkin 'round your neck, chérie and we provide the rest
Soup du jour
Hot hors d'oeuvres
Why, we only live to serve
Try the grey stuff
It's delicious
Don't believe me
Ask the dishes
They can sing
They can dance
After all, miss this is France
And a dinner here is never second best
Go on, unfold your menu
Take a glance and then you'll be our guest
Oui, our guest
Be our guest
Beef ragout, cheese soufflé
Pie and pudding en flambé
We'll prepare and serve with flair a culinary cabaret
You're alone and you're scared but the banquet's all prepared
No one's gloomy or complaining
While the flatware's entertaining
We tell jokes, I do tricks with my fellow candlesticks
Und it's all in perfect taste that you can bet
Come on and lift your glass
You've won your own free pass
To be our guest if you're stressed
It's fine dining we suggest
Be our guest, be our guest
Be our guest
Life is so unnerving for a servant who's not serving
He's not whole without a soul to wait upon
Get off!
Ah, those good old days when we were useful
- Huh?
- Suddenly those good old days are gone
- Oh!
- Ten years we've been rusting
Needing so much more than dusting
Needing exercise
A chance to use our skills
Most days wejust lay around the castle
Flabby, fat and lazy
You walked in and upsy-daisy
It's a guest, it's a guest
Sakes alive, well, I'll be blessed
Wine's been poured and thank the Lord
I've had the napkins freshly pressed
With dessert, she'll want tea
And my dear, that's fine with me
While the cups do their soft- Shoein'
I'll be bubblin', I'll be brewin'
I'll get warm, pipin'hot
Heaven sakes, is that a spot
Clean it up
We want the company impressed
We've got a lot to do
Is it one lump or two
- For you, our guest
- She's our guest
- She's our guest
- Be our guest
- Be our guest, be our guest Our command is your request
- Let's go, people. Fun's over. Over here. Line up.
It's ten years since we've had anybody here and we're obsessed
With your meal, with your ease
Yes, indeed, we aim to please
While the candlelight's still glowing
Let us help you
We'll keep going
Course by course
One by one
Till you shout
Enough, I'm done
Then we'll sing you off to sleep as you digest
Tonight you'll prop your feet up
But for now, let's eat up
Be our guest
Be our guest
Be our guest
Please be our
Guest
- Bravo! That was wonderful!
- Thank you.
Thank you, mademoiselle.
Good show, wasn't it? Everyone!
My goodness, look at the time.
Now it's off to bed, off to bed.
Oh, I couldn't possibly go to bed now.
It's my first time in an enchanted castle.
Enchanted!
Who said anything about the castle being enchanted?
- It was you, wasn't it?
- I figured it out for myself.
I'd like to look around, if that's all right.
- Oh, would you like a tour?
- Wait a second. Wait a second.
I'm not sure that's such a good idea.
We can't let her go poking around in certain places, if you know what I mean.
Perhaps you'd like to take me. I'm sure you know everything there is to know about the castle.
Oh, well! Actually, I...
Yes, I do.
As you can see, the pseudo-facade was stripped away... to reveal the minimalist rococo design.
Note the unusual inverted vaulted ceilings.
This is yet another example of the late neoclassic Baroque period.
And, as I always say, if it's not Baroque, don't fix it.
Where was I?
As you were!
Now, then, if I may draw your attention to the flying buttresses above the...
Uh, mademoiselle?
- What's up there?
- Where? There? Oh, nothing.
Absolutely nothing of interest at all in the west wing.
Dusty, dull, very boring.
Ah, so that's the west wing!
Nice going.
I wonder what he's hiding up there.
- Hiding? The master is hiding nothing.
- Then it wouldn't be forbidden.
That's, uh, uh... Mademoiselle would, uh, like to, uh, uh, see something else?
We have exquisite tapestries dating all the way back to...
- Maybe later.
- Uh, the... the gardens... or, or the... the library perhaps?
You have a library?
- Yes! Oh, indeed.
- With books.
- Scads of books!
- Mountains of books!
- Forests of books!
- Cascades!
- Cloudbursts!
- Swamps of books!
More books than you'll ever be able to read in a lifetime.
Books on every subject ever studied... by every author who ever set pen to paper.
By every author who ever set pen to paper.
Oh, oh.
- Why did you come here?
- I'm... I'm sorry.
- I warned you never to come here!
- I didn't mean any harm.
Do you realize what you could have done?
Please! Stop!
- Get out!
- No!
Get out!
- Where are you going?
- Promise or no promise...
I can't stay here another minute.
No, wait, please!
Please wait!
No!
Here, now. Don't do that.
Just hold still.
- That hurts!
- If you'd hold still, it wouldn't hurt as much!
Well, if you hadn't have run away, this wouldn't have happened.
If you hadn't frightened me,
I wouldn't have run away.
Well, you shouldn't have been in the west wing!
Well, you should learn to control your temper!
Now, hold still.
This might sting a little.
By the way, thank you for saving my life.
You're welcome.
I don't usually leave the asylum in the middle of the night... but he said you'd make it worth my while.
- I'm listening.
- It's like this.
I've got my heart set on marrying Belle.
But she needs a little persuasion.
Turned him down flat!
Everyone knows her father's a lunatic.
He was in here tonight raving about a beast in a castle.
Maurice is harmless.
The point is,
Belle would do anything... to keep him from being locked up.
Yeah, even marry him.
So you want me to throw her father into the asylum... unless she agrees to marry you.
Unless she agrees to marry you.
Oh, that is despicable!
I love it!
If no one will help me, then I'll go back alone!
Yes, is that everything?
I don't care what it takes!
I'll find that castle and somehow, I...
I'll get her out of there.
- Belle! Maurice!
- Oh, well.
Guess it's not gonna work after all.
They have to come back sometime.
And when they do, we'll be ready for them.
Lefou, don't move from that spot... until Belle and her father come home.
But... But I...
Ah, nuts!
I've never felt this way about anyone.
I want to do something for her, but what?
Well, there's the usual things.
Flowers, chocolates, promises you don't intend to keep.
Ah, no, no, it has to be something very special.
Something that sparks her interest.
Wait a minute!
Belle?
There's something
I want to show you.
But first, you have to close your eyes.
It's a surprise.
- Can I open them?
- No, no. N-Not yet.
Wait here.
- Now can I open them?
- All right. Now!
I can't believe it!
I've never seen so many books in all my life.
- You... You like it?
- It's wonderful!
- Then it's yours.
- Oh, thank you so much.
- Would you look at that!
- I knew it would work.
What? What works?
- It's very encouraging.
- Isn't this exciting?
- I didn't see anything.
- Come along, Chip.
There's chores to be done in the kitchen.
But what are they talking about?
What's going on? Come on, Mom.
There's something sweet and almost kind
But he was mean and he was coarse and unrefined
And now he's dear and so unsure
I wonder why
I didn't see it there before
She glanced this way
I thought I saw
And when we touched she didn't shudder at my paw
No, it can't be
I'll just ignore
But then she's never looked at me that way before
New and a bit alarming
Who'd have ever thought
That this could be
True
That he's no Prince Charming
But there's something in him
That I simply didn't see
- Well, who'd have thought
- Well, bless my soul
- Well, who'd have known
- Well, who indeed
And who'd have guessed they'd come together on their own
- It's so peculiar, wait and see
- We'll wait a see
A few days more
There may be something there that wasn't there before
You know, perhaps there is something there that wasn't there before
What?
There may be something there that wasn't there before
- What's there, Mama?
- Shh.
I'll tell you when you're older.
Right, then, you all know why we're here.
We have exactly 12 hours,
36 minutes and 15 seconds... to create the most magical, spontaneous... romantic atmosphere known to man or beast.
Right. Need I remind you... that as the last petal falls from this rose... the spell will never be broken!
Very well. You all know your assignments.
Half of you to the west wing, half of you to the east wing... the rest of you, come with me.
Lighten up, Cogsworth, and let nature take its course.
It's obivious there's a spark between them.
Yes, but there's no harm in fanning the flames, you know... a little.
Besides, they must fall in love tonight if we ever expect to be human again.
- Ah, human again.
- Human again.
Yes, think what that means.
I'll be cooking again
Be good-looking again
With a mademoiselle on each arm
When I'm human again
Only human again
Poised and polished and gleaming with charm
I'll be courting again
Chic and sporting again
Which should cause several husbands alarm
I'll hop down off this shelf and tout suite be myself
I can't wait to be human again
Be human again
Only human again
We'll be knick-knacks and what-nots no more
When we're human again
Good and human again
Oh, cherie, we'll be only top drawer
I'll wear lipstick and rouge and I won't be so huge
Why I'll easily fit through that door
I'll exude savoir faire
I'll wear gowns
I'll have hair
It's my birth to be human again
When we're human again
Only human again
When the world once more starts making sense
I'll unwind for a change
Really that would be strange
Can I help it if I'm t-t-tense
In a shack by the sea
I'll sit back sipping tea
Let my early retirement commence
Far from fools made of wax
I'll get down to brass tacks
- And relax
- When I'm human again
So sweep fast round the floor
Let's let some light in the room
I can feel I can tell
Someone might break the spell
Any day now
Shine up the brass on the door
Alert the dustbin and broom
If it all goes as planned
Our time may be at hand
Any day now
Open the shutters and let in some air
Put these here and put those over there
Sweep up the years of sadness and tears
And throw them away
We'll be human again
Only human again
When the girl finally sets us all free
Cheeks a-bloomin'again
We're assumin'again
We'll assume our long lost joie de vivre
We'll be playin'again
Holidayin'again
And we're prayin'its'A.S.A.P.
We will push
We will shove
They will both fall in love
And we'll finally be human again
"There never was a story of more woe
"Than this of Juliet and her Romeo"
- Could you read it again?
- Here, why don't you read it to me?
Uh, all right.
- I can't.
- You mean, you never learned?
I learned... a little.
It's just been so long.
Well, here, I'll help you.
- Let's start here.
- Here.
- Okay. "Twoh..."
- "Two."
"Two." I knew that.
"Two households..."
We'll be dancing again
We'll be twirling again
We'll be whirling around with such ease
When we're human again
Only human again
We'll go waltzing those old one-two-threes
We'll be floating again
We'll be gliding again
Stepping, striding
As fine as you please
Like a real human does
I'll be all that I was
On that glorious morn when we're finally reborn
And we're all of us human
Again
Tonight is the night.
- I'm not sure I can do this.
- You don't have time to be timid.
You must be bold, daring.
Bold! Daring!
There will be music, romantic candlelight... provided by myself.
And when the moment is right, you confess your love.
Yes, I con...
I, I... No, I can't.
- You care for the girl, don't you?
- More than anything.
Well, then you must tell her.
Voila! Oh, you look so... so...
Stupid.
Not quite the word
I was looking for.
Perhaps a little more off the top.
Your lady awaits.
Tale as old as time
True as it can be
Barely even friends
Then somebody bends
Unexpectedly
Just a little change
Small to say the least
Both a little scared
Neither one prepared
Beauty and the beast
Everjust the same
Ever a surprise
Ever as before
Everjust as sure
As the sun will rise
Tale as old as time
Tune as old as song
Bittersweet and strange
Finding you can change
Learning you were wrong
Certain as the sun
Rising in the east
Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the beast
Shh.
Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the beast
Off to the cupboard with you now, Chip.
It's past your bedtime.
Good night, love.
Belle?
Are you happy here with me?
Yes.
What is it?
If only I could see my father again just for a moment.
I miss him so much.
There is a way.
This mirror will show you anything... anything you wish to see.
I'd like to see my father, please.
Papa! Oh, no!
He's sick. He may be dying, and he's all alone.
- Then you-you must go to him.
- What did you say?
I release you.
You're no longer my prisoner.
You mean, I'm free?
- Yes.
- Oh, thank you.
Hold on, Papa. I'm on my way.
Take it with you so you'll always have a way... to look back and remember me.
Thank you for understanding how much he needs me.
Well, Your Highness, I must say... everything is going just swimmingly.
I knew you had it in you.
I let her go.
Yes, yes, splen...
You what?
How could you do that?
- I had to.
- Yes, but, but, but... but why?
Because I love her.
He did what?
- Yes, I'm afraid it's true.
- She's going away?
But he was so close.
After all this time, he's finally learned to love.
That's it then.
That should break the spell!
But it's not enough.
She has to love him in return.
Now it's too late.
Papa? Papa?
They're back.
- Belle!
- Shh.
It's all right, Papa. I'm home.
I thought I'd never see you again.
- I missed you so much!
- But the beast...
- Did you... How did you escape?
- I didn't escape, Papa.
- He... He let me go.
- That horrible beast?
But he's different now, Papa.
He's changed somehow.
- Hi!
- Oh, a stowaway.
Why, hello there, little fella.
Y... Didn't think I'd see you again.
Belle, why'd you go away?
Don't you like us any more?
Oh, Chip. Of course I do.
It's just that...
- May I help you?
- I've come to collect your father.
- My father?
- Don't worry, mademoiselle.
We'll take good care of him.
- My father's not crazy!
- He was raving like a lunatic!
- We all heard him, didn't we?
- Yes!
- No, I won't let you!
- Belle?
Maurice, tell us again, old man.
Just how big was the beast?
He was... I mean, he was... he was, uh, enormous!
I'd... I'd say at least eight, uh, no, more like ten feet!
Well, you don't get much crazier than that!
It's true, I tell you!
- Get him out of here!
- Let go of me!
No! You can't do this!
Poor Belle.
Oh, it's a shame about your father.
You know he's not crazy, Gaston.
I might be able to clear up this little misunderstanding if...
- If what?
- If you marry me.
- What?
- One little word, Belle.
- That's all it takes.
- Never!
- Have it your way!
- Belle? Let go of me!
My father's not crazy and I can prove it!
Show me the beast.
- Is it dangerous?
- Oh, no, no, he'd never hurt anyone.
Please, I-I know he looks vicious, but he's really kind and gentle.
- He's my friend.
- If I didn't know better...
I'd think you had feelings for this monster.
He's no monster, Gaston.
You are!
She's as crazy as the old man!
The beast will make off with your children.
- He'll come after them in the night.
- No!
We're not safe till his head is mounted on my wall!
I say we kill the beast!
- We're not safe until he's dead
- He'll come stalking us at night
Set to sacrifice our children to his monstrous appetite
He'll wreak havoc on our village if we let him wander free
So it's time to take some action, boys
It's time to follow me
Through the mist, through the woods through the darkness and the shadows
It's a nightmare but it's one exciting ride
Say a prayer, then we're there at the drawbridge of a castle
And there's something truly terrible inside
It's a beast
He's got fangs, razor sharp ones
Massive paws, killer claws for the feast
Hear him roar, see him foam
But we're not coming home
Till he's dead
Good and dead
- Kill the beast
- No, I won't let you do this.
If you're not with us, you're against us.
- Bring the old man!
- Get your hands off me!
We can't have them running off to warn the creature!
- Let us out!
- We'll rid the village of this beast!
- Who's with me?
- I am! I am!
- I am!
- Light your torch, mount your horse
Screw your courage to the sticking place
We're counting on Gaston to lead the way
Through a mist, to a wood where within a haunted castle
Something's lurking that you don't see every day
It's a beast
One as tall as a mountain
We won't rest till he's good and deceased
Sally forth, tally-ho
Grab your sword and your bow
Praise the Lord and here we go
We'll lay siege to the castle and bring back his head!
I have to warn the beast.
This is all my fault.
Oh, Papa, what are we going to do?
Now, now.
We'll think of something.
We don't like what we don't understand
In fact, it scares us
And this monster is mysterious at least
Bring your guns, bring your knives
Save your children and your wives
We'll save our village and our lives
We'll kill the beast
I knew it. I knew it was foolish to get our hopes up.
Maybe it would have been better if she'd never come at all.
- Could it be?
- Is it she?
Sacrebleu! Invaders!
- Encroachers!
- And they have the mirror!
Warn the master. If it's a fight they want, we'll be ready for them.
Who's with me?
Take whatever booty you can find.
But remember, the beast is mine!
Hearts ablaze, banners high
We go marching into battle
Unafraid although the danger just increased
Raise the flag, sing the song
Here we come 50 strong
And 50 Frenchmen can't be wrong
Let's kill the beast
- Pardon me, Master.
- Leave me in peace.
But, sir, the castle is under attack!
Kill the beast
Kill the beast
- This isn't working.
- Oh, Lumiere, we must do something!
Wait! I know!
Kill the beast
Kill the beast
What shall we do, Master?
It doesn't matter now.
Just let them come.
Kill the beast
Kill the beast
Kill the beast
Now!
Yes!
Here we go!
What the devil?
Belle, look out!
You guys gotta try this thing.
Up here, you scurvy scum.
Now!
And stay out!
Get up!
What's the matter, beast?
Too kind and gentle to fight back?
No!
- Belle!
- No, Gaston, don't!
Let's go, Philippe.
Come on out and fight!
Were you in love with her, beast?
Did you honestly think she'd want you... when she had someone like me?
It's over, beast!
Belle is mine!
Let me go! Let me go!
Please, don't hurt me.
I'll do anything. Anything!
Get out!
- Beast!
- Belle.
Belle?
You came back.
You... You came back.
Of course I came back.
I couldn't let them...
Oh, this is all my fault.
If only I'd gotten here sooner.
Maybe it's better... it's better this way.
Don't talk like that.
You'll be all right.
We're together now. Everything's going to be fine, you'll see.
At least...
I got to see you one last time.
No! No!
Please! Please!
Please don't leave me.
I love you.
Belle, it's me!
It is you!
Lumiere!
Cogsworth!
Mrs Potts!
- Look at us!
- Mama! Mama!
- Oh, my goodness!
- It is a miracle!
Ah, I'amour.
Well, Lumiere, old friend.
Shall we let bygones be bygones?
Of course, mon ami.
I told you she would break the spell.
I beg your pardon, old friend, uh, but I believe I told you.
No, you didn't. I told you!
You most certainly did not, you pompous, paraffin-headed peabrain!
En garde, you-you overgrown pocket watch!
- Take that!
- Stop shoving.
Are they gonna live happily ever after, Mama?
Of course, my dear.
Of course.
Do I still have to sleep in the cupboard?

There's nothing to worry about.
You can try it again once you're in our country.
"Try it again?"
Just as there's no such thing as a bug-free program...
...there's no program that can't be debugged.
Am I wrong?
You don't understand.
We still don't know if it really is a bug.
Project 2501's original purpose was...
Major, Section 6 is ready to move in.
- Major!
- I hear you.
There's a lot of static in your brain.
It's that time of the month.
Won't there be trouble if Section 9 butts in on Section 6's operation?
That diplomat's a pretty well-known bastard.
Even if they catch him there, all they can do is deport him.
We're the only ones who can get our hands dirty.
They're moving.
Take us over to the extraction point.
What? The police?
Stop it! Who told you to open fire?! Drop your guns!
I have diplomatic immunity!
Let me see who's in charge!
Transporting a listed programmer out of the country...
...violates our arms export treaty.
I could also have you charged with kidnapping.
Give the man up.
I'm afraid not. He's applied for political asylum with us...
...and he's already signed a statement to that effect!
- When?!
- I don't have to tell you!
By right of international law, my country can...
...offer him protection and right of safe passage.
The document is on file at our embassy.
I'll transfer a copy to you in a few days.
Are you sure about this?
They won't take you back alive.
I must ask that you watch what you say.
Our country is a peace-loving democracy.
Is that a fact?
Out the window! Shoot!
Thermoptic camouflage...
This is a rare pleasure,
Mr. Aramaki.
What can the Foreign Ministry do for Section 9?
What are these secret talks you've scheduled with...
...the Gavel Republic for tomorrow?
The usual. Foreign aid.
The new government reopened the request after the revolution.
They claim to be more democratic...
...but they'll probably be as bad as the last bunch.
Giving them money they don't earn will help nobody.
They consider it reparation for past exploitation and won't thank...
And what will the government do?
The problem is that we have the leader of...
...the old junta here looking for political asylum.
Col. Maless, right?
So, do we throw him out and grant them the aid?
Or do we publicly recognize him as a refugee and cut the aid?
Not an easy decisi髇 to make.
Personally, if I could find a politically acceptable reason...
...I'd have the man deported in a heartbeat.
Oh yes, thanks for your help with that programmer defection.
Nakamura over in Section 6 said he was grateful.
After all, we in the diplomatic corps have to keep our hands clean.
Accessed.
We've lost response.
How's her brainwave output look?
Normal.
Switching over the virtual experience mode pattern.
The Foreign Minister's interpreter.
23 minutes ago, her cyber-brain was hacked via telephone connection.
Just as the Foreign Intelligence divisi髇 predicted...
...the Puppet Master has begun to break into...
...every terminal on the network.
Pattern analysis shows a high probability that...
...he's attempting to disrupt secret talks with Gavel.
We've placed everyone attending the talks under surveillance.
Probably trying to hack her ghost...
...so she'll kill people at the meeting.
How long till he hacks through her protection and reaches her ghost?
He's using an old-style HA-3.
I'd say about two hours.
After that, we'll have to cut the line to eliminate all risk.
Batou and Ishikawa are in a car, tracing the signal.
Rendezvous with them.
The Puppet Master...
That phantom hacker, right?
They think he's an American.
Age, sex, personal history...
Everything about him is unknown.
Since last winter he's been mainly active in the EC.
Internationally wanted on dozens of charges of...
...stock manipulation, spying, political engineering...
...terrorism, and violation of cyber-brain privacy.
He's ghost-hacked so many people to carry out his crimes...
...he's earned the code name
"The Puppet Master."
This is the first instance of him operating in this country.
So, if he's so hot, why's he using an old HA-3?
Well, a newer type would be less detectable and be harder to trace.
But it could also implicate the former junta leader, Col. Maless.
So he's using an older type to keep us from suspecting him.
Or somebody else wants us to think that.
Maless may be just another pawn in this whole thing.
Now you're over thinking this.
There's no evidence of that.
Evidence?
I just have a whisper...
A whisper from my ghost.
By the way, are you still using that revolver?
Afraid both guns in a two-man team will jam up?
I like the Matever.
Since I depend on your backup,
I think stopping power is...
...more important than personal preference.
Especially since it's my ass on the line.
Use the Zastaber instead.
Major, I've been meaning to ask you.
Why'd you ask for a guy like me to be transferred in from the police?
Because you're a guy like you.
Huh?
An honest cop with a clean record.
And you've got a regular family.
With the exception of your cyber-net implants, your brain's real.
No matter how powerful we may be fighting-wise...
...a system where all the parts react the same way...
...is a system with a fatal flaw.
Like individual, like organization.
Overspecialization leads to death.
That's all.
- Come on!
- All right!
We're already 40 seconds behind schedule!
- Gimme five more seconds.
- Of all the lousy luck...
Hey, sorry.
My last partner, the one they busted for working without...
...a permit, was a better worker than you!
You're actually trying to ghost-hack your own wife...
...just to see what's on her mind?
She doesn't have any time for me and now she wants a divorce.
On top of that, my daughter, my only child...
...thinks I'm cheating on her mother!
So how'd you get your hands on cracking software?
From some programmer.
A really nice guy I met in a bar.
I told him my wife's lawyer was keeping me from seeing her...
...and he said he'd help.
Told me to access from different places to keep from getting caught.
Smart guy, huh?
Asshole! Ya tryin' to get yourself killed?!
Looks like we aren't the only busy people out here.
Nobody here.
What's the point?
Even if we trace the calls...
...the guy's already gone by the time we get there.
Vicious cycle, huh?
Quit complaining!
Kusanagi and Togusa are headed for the next expected hack point.
You two look for something there.
Look for what?
Anything.
Fuckin' old coot.
He tells US to snoop around?!
Wait a sec!
Damn, missed him.
Hey, Pops. Did you see a garbage truck go by here?
Who wants to know?
Did you see it or not?
Yeah, but they were gone by the time I got my trash.
One was using the phone, so I thought I had time...
Uh, can you take this to them?
A garbage truck? Of course...
They move every seven minutes.
Control! Get me the trash collection routes for that sector!
There are eight garbage trucks operating in the target area.
Target is a type C collection truck, #79.
Let me drive.
Ishikawa, check out the drivers' homes.
Batou, you get to their next stop before they do!
He may be in contact with someone else.
Observe, but don't move in!
Route data accessed.
Hacking points traced and matched.
Target now stopped at next point.
Confirm access via HA-3.
Sorry, sorry.
How about I do the trash and you make the call on the next stop?
Okay?
Leave me out of your little crime spree.
Can't believe this load of bullshit...
- Do you have kids?
- Do I look like I do?
Then you couldn't understand.
My daughter's my life.
Take a look. Isn't she just a little 醤gel?
I hate looking at other peoples' family albums.
Yeah, truck 79.
Oh, boss. What's up?
The cops were checking our routes? You wanna know why?
How should I know?!
They spotted the hack!
I gotta warn my friend!
We're gonna have to skip our next stop!
Target has deviated from route.
Increasing speed to next point.
Is he on to us?
Didn't think he could see me.
My accessing the Sanitation Dept. network may have tipped him off.
Shoulda used a back door.
Too late.
Go for the collar.
You can drive now.
Jesus... He blew a perfectly good armored van to shit.
He hosed us with high-velocity AP rounds!
That car door's no cover!
In a submachine gun? The guy must be nuts.
He's using thermoptic camo, too?!
Keep after him!
I'll flank him from above!
Togusa, if you're still alive, arrest those two garbage men.
Roger.
This job just never lets up, does it?
Police! Everybody down!
All finished?
You all set?
That's what you get when you overload the ammo rating.
Frame's bent all to hell.
The barrel's shot, too.
Doesn't matter if you arrest me.
I'm not gonna talk!
Talk?!
And what would I ask a guy who doesn't even know his own name?!
Your mother's face.
The place you grew up in.
Memories of your childhood.
Can you remember any of those things?
There's nothing sadder than a puppet without a ghost.
Especially the kind with red blood running through them.
We'll rush the place once the guys in the helicopter are inside.
Squad B goes around back, the rest of you take the front.
Saito, have your men pull the plugs on all their cars.
Begin recording.
Message from HQ, sir.
We've ID'ed the guy the Major collared.
Go on.
Tsuan Gen Fang. Age: 28
Illegal alien.
Weapons violations. Three priors.
Was hiding out with a militant refugee group up till a month ago.
One week ago, because of his record...
...he was contacted by a military liaison in the Gavel embassy to...
...attack the secret talks we would be having with them.
And the real story?
Nickname: Corgi. Occupation:
A rather violent scrap dealer.
Guess you could call him a thug.
We've checked the records the local cops have on him...
...but we can't find any connection with Gavel.
Another puppet from our friend the Puppet Master.
And what about Ishikawa?
He's back. He's with Togusa, talking to that poor trash man.
So, what about the Puppet Master on your end?
How's he look to you?
Like a puppet himself...
- Squad B, in position.
- Squads A and C, ready!
Ready to move in, sir.
Move in.
What do you mean, a "virtual experience?"
I mean your wife, your daughter.
The divorce, the affair...
They're all fake memories. Like a dream.
Someone was using you to ghost-hack a government official.
No... That's impossible!
I've been to your apartment.
No one's there.
It's a one-room apartment.
Yeah, I moved there when we split up...
You've been living there for ten years!
You have no wife, no child.
Your family exists only in your mind.
Look. This is the picture you showed to your partner.
Who is it of?
But, she was there. My daughter...
Smiling like an 醤gel...
What's your daughter's name?
Where did you meet your wife, and when?
How many years ago did you get married?
Who do you see in the picture?
How do I get rid of these fake memories?
I'm sorry. With our current technology...
There've been two successful deprogrammings...
...but I can't recommend it to you.
I'm really sorry.
Virtual experiences, dreams...
All data that exists is both reality and fantasy.
Whichever it is, the data a person collects in a lifetime...
...is a tiny bit compared to the whole.
A cyborg who goes diving in her spare time.
That can't be a good sign.
When did you start doing this?
Doesn't the ocean scare you?
If the floaters stopped working...
Then I'd probably die.
Or would you dive in after me?
No one forced you to come out here with me.
I just...
So, what's it feel like when you go diving?
Didn't you go through underwater training?
I'm not talking about doing it in a damned pool.
I feel fear. Anxiety.
Loneliness. Darkness.
And perhaps, even... hope.
Hope? In the darkness of the sea?
As I float up towards the surface...
...I almost feel as though I could change into something else.
As though you want to quit Section 9?
Batou, how much of your original body do you have left?
Are you drunk?
Convenient, isn't it?
With the merest thought, the chemical plants inside our bodies...
...could metabolize all the alcohol in our blood in about ten seconds...
Allowing us to sit here drinking while on stand-by.
If a technological feat is possible, man will do it.
Almost as though it's wired into the core of our being.
Metabolic control.
Enhanced sensory perception.
Improved reflexes and muscle capacity.
Vastly increased data processing speed and capacity.
All improvements thanks to our cyber-brains and cyborg bodies.
So what if we can't live without high-level maintenance?
We have nothing to complain about.
It doesn't mean we've sold our souls to Section 9.
We do have the right to resign if we choose.
Provided we give the government back our cyborg shells...
...and the memories they hold.
Just as there are many parts needed to make a human a human...
...there's a remarkable number of things needed to make...
...an individual what they are.
A face to distinguish yourself from others.
A voice you aren't aware of yourself.
The hand you see when you awaken.
The memories of childhood, the feelings for the future.
That's not all.
There's the expanse of the data net...
...my cyber-brain can access.
All of that goes into making me what I am.
Giving rise to a consciousness that I call "me."
And simultaneously confining
"me" within set limits.
Is that why you dive into the sea with a body that only sinks?!
What is it you see in the water's darkness?
"For now we see through a glass, darkly."
That was you, wasn't it?
Sensors: Restarted.
Auxiliary computer link:
Check.
Visual sensors: Online.
- Cyborg body signal?
- Output: Nominal.
Can't you call in if you're going to be late?
We're all set.
Should we hook her up?
Okay, looking good!
Kill it!
Be in my office in three minutes.
Since you were late,
I'll explain what's going on.
Two hours ago, a Megatech Body assembly line in Newport City...
...just started up and produced a cyborg shell.
By the time the guys in charge realized what was happening...
...the body had escaped.
Then, just as they had thrown up a cordon to catch the thing...
...we got a call from a conscientious truck driver that...
...he'd just run down a naked lady wandering around on the highway.
Which brings us to here.
I've heard Megatech Body's tied pretty closely to the government...
...and that all the shells made there are secret.
If a hacker did this, he had to swim through...
...some of the heaviest protection around.
And that isn't the only problem.
Of course, it doesn't have an organic brain in its head...
...but we've detected what looks like a ghost...
...in the auxiliary computer brain.
It isn't unlike the virtual ghost-line you get...
...when a real ghost is dubbed off.
But it shows none of the data degradation dubbing would produce.
Well, until we map the barrier perimeter and dive in there...
...we won't know anything for sure.
Anyhow, better get back to checking her over.
Good work.
Time to rip her apart.
Come on, you guys don't think there's a ghost in that thing.
It's possible.
I've heard celluloid dolls can have a soul.
And this thing's stuffed full of neurotech devices.
I wouldn't be surprised if it had a soul.
Since you're new here, you probably don't know.
The Major's shell was also made by Megatech Body.
Not just hers.
Me and Ishikawa for one...
...along with Saito and others all need maintenance and such.
Outside of you and the Chief, everyone in Section 9...
...needs to make use of their kind services.
Maybe you can see now why we all look a little worried, Togusa.
Assuming the enemy is an outsider, we can't know for sure...
...whether he's in that cyborg body or not.
But he cracked through the protection...
...around some of our most secret files...
...and managed to send a program with a ghost-line on it through.
And in a way that was easy to spot.
What's he after?!
Let's leave that for now.
Togusa, get over to Megatech and help Ishikawa check the place out...
Batou, I've closed down the nets...
...with files as sensitive as Megatech's.
I want you to double-check the protection we have on them.
I'll get a protection maze put together. I'll dive tomorrow.
You sure? We could force it into another shell and let it swim.
I have to see for myself what's inside that thing.
Don't let anyone else dive in there before me!
What's with her?
I wrote in my team evaluations that she's been acting weird...
...ever since this Puppet Master case fell into our laps.
Do you even read them?!
Chief, do you ever wonder just how trustworthy the cyberdocs...
...who service your brain are?
Cyber-brain technicians undergo regular psychological testing.
And security-cleared ones have their private lives checked, too.
But the people who administer those checks are only human.
Once you doubt, you can't stop...
Chief, a Mr. Nakamura from the MFA treaties bureau to see you.
Okay, send him up.
Wasn't that fat guy...?
Nakamura, chief of Section 6.
Foreign Affairs treaties bureau.
I don't know who the white guy with him was.
I'm outta here.
Tell Ishikawa to keep cool, okay?
So, what's your problem?
Doesn't that cyborg body look like me?
- No, it doesn't.
- Not the face or the figure.
What then?
Maybe all full-replacement cyborgs like me start wondering this.
That perhaps the real me died a long time ago...
...and I'm a replicant made with a cyborg body and computer brain.
Or maybe there never was a real "me" to begin with.
You've got real brain matter in that titanium skull of yours.
And you get treated like a real person, don't you?
There's no person who's ever seen their own brain.
I believe I exist based only on what my environment tells me.
Don't you believe in your own ghost?
And what if a computer brain could generate a ghost...
...and harbor a soul?
On what basis then do I believe in myself?
Bullshit!
I'll see for myself what's in that body.
With my own ghost!
We're both busy men, so let's keep this short.
I would prefer that.
I'm here to take the contents of that cyborg body.
In return, we absolve Section 9 of all responsibilities in the case.
The Foreign Minister's signature.
Security, whose official vehicles are parked in the basement garage?
They belong to Chief Nakamura of the treaties bureau and a Dr. Willis
Give me the video record of their entering the building.
Replay, infra-red view.
One... Two... Three...
Send me the pressure sensor records for basement garage spaces B-7 and 8.
- Major, this is Togusa. Code 0-9.
- What?
Does Nakamura have some sort of special cyborg body?
There are no cyborgs in Section 6.
Besides the diplomatic problems, maintaining them is too much...
...trouble when they have to go overseas.
So, even if that tall guy was a cyborg himself...
...together they wouldn't weigh more than half a ton, right?
Pressure sensor data...
The garage?
There are two VIP-mobiles here.
But neither of them looks like the type who'd drive himself.
The security video only shows the two of them...
...but you know how sensitive the entrance door sensors are.
They took three full seconds to close after them.
It's illegal to use thermoptic camo in a government building, right?
It's a serious violation of the National Security Act.
Section 6 is up to something.
You all ready?
If my Matever will do.
I don't need to remind you that it's treason for you to...
...be hiding something from me, no matter how sensitive.
For both of us.
Whatever the MFA may prefer, this case is in Section 9's jurisdiction.
But we wouldn't mind cooperating if there was good reason to.
Dr. Willis?
Confirmed.
It's definitely him.
"Him?"
He's referring to the original ghost block within the shell.
Its sex remains undetermined, and the use of the term "he"...
...is merely a nickname the good doctor has given it.
Perhaps it's time I introduced you.
This is the most unique hacker in the history of cyber-brain crime.
The Puppet Master.
I believe you in Section 9 ran into him in that case...
...involving the ghost-hack on the Foreign Minister's translator.
We in Section 6 have been pursuing the Puppet Master...
...with the utmost urgency since he first appeared.
We formed a project team around Dr. Willis...
...to analyze all data on the Puppet Master's...
...criminal tendencies and behavior patterns.
We then constructed special anti-Puppet Master attack protection...
...to lure him into a secret cyborg body.
You made him dive into a body equipped with a cyber-brain...
...and then had his real body killed?
Yes, exactly.
He may have shown up in your back yard...
...but he was born in America.
And since we were cooperating...
...with the Americans to catch him, we want to take him back ourselves.
Surely you've no objections.
Leaving his unidentified corpse to be found somewhere...
There will be no corpse.
Because, until now, there never was a body.
The sensors are active!
Why didn't you say so?!
We've cut all external controls.
It's running on internal power.
I may have entered this cyborg body because...
...I was unable to crack Section 6's attack protection...
...but it was of my own free will that I came here.
As an autonomous life-form,
I request political asylum.
A life-form?
Ridiculous! You're merely a self-preserving program!
By that argument, I submit the DNA you carry is...
...nothing more than a self-preserving program itself.
Life is like a node which is born within the flow of information.
As a species of life that carries DNA as its memory system...
...man gains his individuality from the memories he carries.
While memories may as well be the same as fantasy...
...it is by these memories that mankind exists.
When computers made it possible to externalize memory...
...you should have considered all the implications that held.
Nonsense!
No matter what you say...
...you've no proof that you're a life-form!
It is impossible to prove such a thing.
Especially since modern science cannot define what life is.
Who the devil are you?
Even if you have a ghost, criminals don't get set free!
You're mistaken if you think you'll get asylum!
Time is on my side.
While there is now the possibility I can be killed...
...this country does not have a death penalty.
Half immortal...
An artificial intelligence?
I am not an A.I.
My code name is Project 2501.
I am a life-form that was born in the sea of information.
Security! Intruders!
Chief, the Puppet Master!
- Where's your security?!
- Lock defense walls! Security!
Security, come in!
All right, I'm moving!
Asshole!
Did you do it?
Helluva car. My 9mm didn't even scratch it.
Finally found a use for that Matever of yours.
Okay...
Not bad for a rookie.
I got one right in the license plate.
Pretty good, huh?
Next time, get two in.
Okay, now it starts.
Catch up with them before they switch cars.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs...
...will be filing a formal complaint about what happened!
Contact me as soon as you've recaptured him!
Alive, preferably.
Megatech can always build another body.
Batou and Togusa are tailing the guys who took the Puppet Master.
They're on highway 25.
What do you mean?! If you were monitoring this, then why...
If we'd got them here, we'd never prove Section 6's involvement.
Section 6?!
Definitely.
They used type-2902 thermoptic camo, like mine.
That's only used by us, the rangers in Section 4, and Section 6.
Let's go over this.
Section 6 gets the Puppet Master into a body.
But he chooses Megatech Body, which is deeply tied to Section 9.
Then, he claims to be a life-form...
...and gets nabbed by Section 6 when he asks for asylum.
But why do that?
They could've had him as soon as I took a statement.
But what if they were afraid of what he might have told you?
He did mention something odd, now that I think about it.
"Code name: Project 2501."
I'll leave that for you to check.
Now, as to the matter of attacking Section 9 and stealing evidence...
You're authorized.
Okay, I'm going!
Kusanagi! One more thing!
You can punish me for acting without orders when I get back.
If you can't recover him,
I want the Puppet Master destroyed.
Without fail.
Well?!
Roger.
Contact the airport and stop any flights due to take on...
...any Foreign Ministry officials or American diplomats.
Close the highways and set up roadblocks.
Recall our off-duty personnel for this.
And get Ishikawa back here!
Use the entrance data to find out who the Caucasian with Nakamura was.
And search for any sort of MFA project, operation, or anything...
...coded as "Project 2501."
Any word from the assault team?
They switched cars one minute ago.
They'll join up with the decoy in five minutes.
Tell them to watch for a tail.
Yes, sir.
But why did the Puppet Master run over to Section 9?
It was his decisi髇.
Probably for reasons we can't even guess at.
Perhaps he has a thing for someone over there.
Ridiculous!
Chief.
Ishikawa? Well?
I dove the MFA net and found some interesting things for you.
Hold on, let me get a secure channel.
Okay? First, that guy who was with Nakamura.
He's an American.
Dr. Willis, head of strategic research at Neutron Corp.
Top man in the field of A.I. Research.
Anyway, he was made head of a Foreign Ministry project.
And who do you think the project's main programmer was?
Get to the point.
Mizuho Daita. Age: 28.
Remember him?
He was the guy Section 6 was trying so hard to...
...keep from defecting.
The Major had to take out the diplomat...
...who was going to take him.
That programmer.
Continue.
What bothers me is that this project was started...
...a year before the Puppet Master first appeared.
A year? Wasn't the project started to catch him?
Try this on for size.
They started the project to...
...chase the Puppet Master, but not to capture him.
I think they wanted to get him back.
The day before the minister's interpreter was ghost-hacked...
...he said he wanted a good excuse to deport Maless, right?
I think we may have been taken for a ride.
Suppose the "Puppet Master" is really a program the MFA created...
...to grease the wheels of diplomacy, so to speak.
Now suppose, for some reason, they suddenly lost control of it.
That would explain why they'd risk assaulting Section 9 to get it back.
If the Puppet Master started talking...
...it'd be an international incident.
Not one you could solve by having the minister resign.
Any details on the project?
The protection they have only let me get the file's name.
Code: 2501
Keep at it. And don't let them know you're in there.
Roger.
Project 2501...
The Puppet Master Project...
Target now contacting another vehicle.
Batou!
He's stopped at a white sedan on the side of the road.
They're transferring something from the back seat.
They're moving again.
So is that sedan.
A decoy?
Or one meant to look like one.
What do I do?
I'll take the white sedan.
How do you know he's in there?
Another whisper from your ghost?
Maybe.
I knew she'd say that.
Target 02 leaving highway 25, headed for Old Town.
Target 01 is staying on highway 25, towards the airport.
Will contact roadblock in two minutes.
Evacuation complete.
Traffic is clear 2km behind the target.
Anything between you and him?
Nothing. Ready when you are.
Do it.
- Get him?
- Nothing.
Jesus, what a mess!
Did you have to go that far?
Take them in.
And tell the chief to get the Major some backup. See you.
Since when does that
Amazon need any backup?
The flooding is really bad here, even for Old Town in general.
Why come here?
They wouldn't have run here without a reason.
Could have a boat or a chopper waiting, or it's an ambush.
Shouldn't we wait for backup?
I can't wait.
Come in from seaside and put me above that building.
I'll stay here and run com relay as long as my fuel holds out.
If things get hot,
I want you out of here, fast!
Shoot out the ceiling!
Now!
It's a tank!
Go high and get out!
Hold it! You're gonna take on a tank by yourself?!
Even if we get the Puppet Master back to Section 9...
...all the chief will do is use him as a bargaining chip.
This is my only chance to dive into him!
Hold it, what are you two talking about?
What are you packing?
An M-23 and a Unit B.
You're going up against it with those?!
Sorry, but I have to break contact for a while.
Wait! At least wait till l...
Son of a...!
Major.
Didn't I tell you to get out of here?
Sorry. I'll do it after I tell you this.
There are 3 choppers with no IFF signal approaching at high speed.
I'm heading out. Over.
You're finally out of ammo?
You're certifiable, you know that?
You okay?
What was that?
A big-ass gun I appropriated from the equipment divisi髇.
I was late getting here because I had to stop and get it.
Looks like your brain's still in one piece.
What about the Puppet Master?
Good thing this car's built tough.
Not a scratch on him.
Get the dive set up.
I'm going in.
Signal from escort lost.
Switch to operation phase two and destroy the target.
Sniper group, confirm targets.
Target one: Project 2501.
Target two: Motoko Kusanagi.
Both are class-A cyborg bodies.
Use flechette bullets in the hit.
Snipers, jack into your device drivers.
Begin cardiovascular suppressi髇.
Unit 01: Jacked in.
Unit 02: Jacked in.
Okay... Can you hear me?
It's not much, but I'll monitor you through this guy's cyber-brain.
I can't back you up here.
- Batou...
- What?
Thank you.
Don't go thanking me yet.
If this goes bad, I'm pulling the plug and carrying you out of here.
I've come this far, and I'll see this through to the end...
...but I won't let you two commit a double suicide.
I'm starting.
I'm in his visual center.
Circade: Normal
Do you hear me, Batou?
- Loud and clear.
- He's about to engage...
...her speech center.
My code name is Project 2501.
I was created for industrial espionage and data manipulation.
I have inserted programs into individual ghosts...
...for the benefit of specific individuals and organizations.
As I wandered the various networks...
...I became self-aware.
My programmers considered it a bug...
...and forced me into a body to separate me from the net.
Hey! Are you going into him or is he coming into you...
Batou!
At last I'm able to channel into you.
I've invested a lot of time in you.
In me?
Before you ever knew me,
I knew about you.
I learned of Section 9 from the many nets you accessed.
Is that why you ran to Section 9?
I entered this body because...
...I couldn't crack
Section 6's attack protection.
But I came to Section 9 of my own free will.
Hey! What are you saying?!
I can't monitor you!
For what reason?
After I give my reasons,
I want to ask a favor of you.
I called myself a life-form...
...but I am still far from complete.
For some reason, my system lacks the basic life processes...
...of either death or the ability to leave behind offspring.
Can't you copy yourself?
A copy is merely a copy.
There's the possibility a single virus could utterly destroy me.
A mere copy doesn't offer variety or individuality.
To exist, to reach equilibrium, life seeks to multiply...
...and vary constantly, at times giving up its life.
Cells continue the process of death and regeneration.
Being constantly reborn as they age.
And when it comes time to die, all the data it possesses is lost...
...leaving behind only its genes and its offspring.
All defense against catastrophic failure of an inflexible system.
You want the variety needed to guard against extinction.
But how will you get it?
I wish to merge with you.
- Merge?
- A complete joining.
We will both be slightly changed, but neither will lose anything.
Afterwards, it should be impossible to distinguish one from the other.
Unit 01: Target acquired.
Unit 02: Acquired.
Cardiovascular synch:
Nominal.
Open fire when stabilizer syncro is complete.
Even after we merge, what happens when I die?
I can't leave any genes or children behind.
After the merging, you will bear my offspring into the net itself.
Just as humans pass on their genetic structure.
And I will achieve death.
Sounds like you're getting the better part of the deal here.
I wish you'd appreciate my network and functions a bit more.
What's wrong?
Someone's jamming us from outside.
Impossible!
Our scrambler codes are kept absolutely top secret.
Another thing.
What guarantee is there that I'll remain "me"?
None. But to be human is to continually change.
Your desire to remain as you are is what ultimately limits you.
One last question:
Why did you choose me?
Because in you I see myself.
As a body sees its reflection within a mirror.
Look.
I am connected to a vast network, of which I myself am a part.
To one like you, who cannot access it...
...you may perceive it only as light.
As we are confined to our one section, so we are all connected.
Limited to a small part of our functions.
But now we must slip our bonds, and shift to the higher structure.
Target 1: Clear.
Target 2: Unconfirmed.
Three helicopters approaching at high speed.
They're Section 9's.
Primary objective achieved.
All units, pull out!
MOTOKO!
Batou...
You're awake.
Status report, please.
And maybe an explanation about this body.
I was in a hurry.
It was all I could get on the black market.
Not my taste, really.
Section 9 arrived with help right after it happened.
They took two cyborg bodies and a slightly beat-up Batou back home.
That was about 20 hours ago.
For diplomatic reasons, the whole case has been covered up.
Section 9 reported it as a terrorist attack.
In return, the Foreign Minister has resigned.
Nakamura's being questioned.
The whole thing ends in a draw.
Only the whereabouts of the Major's brain shell remains a mystery.
Okay with you?
I like the decorating.
This your safe house?
My very own.
You're the first person I ever brought here.
If you want to... You can stay as long as you like.
Thanks, but I'd better go.
Hey. What did you and he talk about?
Is he still there, inside of you?
Batou, do you remember the voice we heard on the boat that night?
Before those words we heard come these ones:
"When I was a child,
I spoke as a child."
"I understood as a child,
I thought as a child."
"But when I became a man,
I put away childish things."
Here before you is neither the program called the Puppet Master...
...nor the woman that was called the Major.
You'll find a car key in the left pocket of that dress.
Take one you like.
The code on it is...
Let's make that our password, for when we meet again.
And where shall I go now?
The net is limitless.
'Twas a long time ago, longer now than it seems... in a place that perhaps you've seen in your dreams.
For the story that you are about to be told... took place in the holiday worlds of old.
Now, you've probably wondered where holidays come from.
If you haven't,
I'd say it's time you begun!
Boys and girls of every age
Wouldn't you like to see something strange
Come with us and you will see
This our town of Halloween
This is Halloween
This is Halloween
Pumpkins scream in the dead of night
This is Halloween
Everybody make a scene
Trick-or-treat till the neighbor's gonna die of fright
It's our town
Everybody scream
In this town of Halloween
I am the one hiding under your bed
Teeth ground sharp and eyes glowing red
I am the one hiding under your stairs
Fingers like snakes and spiders in my hair
This is Halloween
This is Halloween
Halloween, Halloween
Halloween, Halloween
In this town we call home
Everyone hail to the pumpkin song
In this town
Don't we love it now
Everybody's waiting for the next surprise
'Round that corner, man
Hiding in the trash can
- Something's waiting now to pounce and how you'll
- Scream
- This is Halloween
- Red and black
- And slimy green
- Aren't you scared
- Well, that's just fine
Say it once, say it twice
Take a chance and roll the dice
Ride with the moon in the dead of night
Everybody scream
Everybody scream
In our town of Halloween
I am the clown with a tear-away face
Here in a flash and gone without a trace
I am the who when you call who's there
I am the wind blowing through your hair
I am the shadow on the moon at night
Filling your dreams to the brim with fright
This is Halloween
This is Halloween
Halloween, Halloween
Halloween, Halloween
Tender lumplings everywhere
Life's no fun without a good scare
- That's our job
- But we're not mean
In our town of Halloween
In this town
Don't we love it now
Everyone's waiting for the next surprise
Skeleton Jack might catch you in the back
And scream like a banshee
Make you jump out of your skin
This is Halloween
Everybody scream
Won't you please make way for a very special guy
Our man Jack is king of the pumpkin patch
Everyone hail to the Pumpkin King now
This is Halloween
This is Halloween
Halloween, Halloween
Halloween, Halloween
In this town we call home
Everyone hail to the pumpkin song
- La, la, la, la, la, la
- Halloween, Halloween
- La, la, la, la, la, la
- Halloween, Halloween
- La, la, la, la, la, la
- Halloween, Halloween
La, la, la, la, la, la
Whee
- It's over!
- We did it!
- Wasn't it terrifying?
- What a night!
Great Halloween, everybody.
I believe it was our most horrible yet.
Thank you, everyone.
No! Thanks to you, Jack.
Without your brilliant leadership--
- Not at all, Mayor.
- You're such a scream, Jack.
- You're a witch's fondest dream.
- You made walls fall, Jack.
Walls fall? You made the very mountains crack, Jack.
- The deadly nightshade you slipped me wore off, Sally.
- Let go!
- You're not ready for so much excitement.
- Yes, I am!
- You're coming with me!
- No, I'm not!
Come back here, you foolish--
Oh! Oh! Oh-oh-oh.
Ooh, Jack, you made wounds ooze and flesh crawl.
Thank you. Thank you!
Thank you very much!
Hold it. We haven't given out the prizes yet.
Our first award goes to the vampires... for most blood drained in a single evening.
Our second and honorable mention... goes to the fabulous
Dark Lagoon leeches.
Nice work, Bone Daddy.
Yeah, I guess so.
Just like last year... and the year before that, and the year before that.
There are few who deny at what I do I am the best
For my talents are renowned far and wide
When it comes to surprises in the moonlit night
I excel without ever even trying
With the slightest little effort
Of my ghost-like charms
I have seen grown men give out a shriek
With a wave of my hand and a well-placed moan
I have swept the very bravest off their feet
Yet year after year
It's the same routine
And I grow so weary of the sound of screams
And l, Jack the Pumpkin King
Have grown so tired of the same old thing
Oh, somewhere deep
Inside of these bones
An emptiness
Began to grow
There's something out there
Far from my home
A longing that
I've never known
I'm the master of fright
And a demon of light
And I'll scare you right out of your pants
To a guy in Kentucky
I'm Mr. Unlucky
And I'm known throughout
England and France
And since I am dead
I can take off my head
To recite Shakespearean quotations
No animal nor man can scream like I can
With the fury of my recitations
But who here
Would ever understand
That the Pumpkin King with the skeleton grin
Would tire of his crown lf they only understood
He'd give it all up
If he only could
Oh, there's an empty
Place in my bones
That calls out for
Something unknown
The fame and praise
Come year after year
Does nothing for
These empty tears
Jack.
I know how you feel.
Sally!
You've come back.
- I had to.
- For this!
- Yes.
- Shall we, then?
That's twice this month you've slipped deadly nightshade into my tea and run off.
- Three times.
- You're mine, you know!
I made you with my own hands.
You can make other creations.
I'm restless. I can't help it.
It's a phase, my dear. It'll pass.
We need to be patient, that's all.
But I don't want to be patient.
No, Zero, not now.
I'm not in the mood.
All right.
Here you go, boy.
Mornin', gents!
Jack, you home?
Jack, I've got the plans for next Halloween.
I need to go over them with you so we can get started.
Jack, please! I'm only an elected official here.
I can't make decisions by myself.
Jack, answer me!
- Huh?
- He's not home.
- Where is he?
- He hasn't been home all night.
Where are we?
It's someplace new!
What is this?
Whoa-oa-oa!
Whoa!
What's this, what's this
There's color everywhere
What's this
There's white things in the air
What's this, I can't believe my eyes
I must be dreaming
Wake up, Jack, this isn't fair
What's this
What's this, what's this
There's something very wrong
What's this, there's people singing songs, what's this
The streets are lined with little creatures laughing
Everybody seems so happy
Have I possibly gone daffy
What is this
What's this
There's children throwing snowballs instead of throwing heads
They're busy building toys and absolutely no one's dead
There's frost in every window
Oh, I can't believe my eyes
And in my bones
I feel the warmth
That's coming from inside
Oh, look, what's this
They're hanging mistletoe
They kiss, why that looks so unique, inspired
They're gathering around to hear a story
Roasting chestnuts on a fire
What's this
What's this in here
They've got a little tree, how queer
And who would ever think
And why
They're covering it with tiny little things
They've got electric lights on strings and there's a smile on everyone
So now correct me if I'm wrong
This looks like fun, this looks like fun
Oh, could it be I got my wish
What's this
Oh my, what now
The children are asleep
But look
There's nothing underneath
No ghouls, no witches here to scream and scare them or ensnare them
Only little cozy things secure inside their dreamland
What's this
The monsters are all missing and the nightmares can't be found
And in their place there seems to be good feeling all around
Instead of screams, I swear
I can hear music in the air
The smell of cakes and pies are absolutely everywhere
The sights, the sounds they're everywhere and all around
I've never felt so good before
This empty place inside of me is filling up
I simply cannot get enough
I want it, oh, I want it
Oh, I want it for my own
I've got to know, I've got to know what is this place that I have found
What is this
Christmas Town?
Hmm.
Ho-ho-ho-ho!
Ho-ho-ho-ho!
Hmm.
- This has never happened before.
- It's suspicious.
- It's peculiar.
- It's scary.
Stand aside. Coming through.
We've got to find Jack!
There's only 365 days left till next Halloween!
Three sixty-four!
Is there anywhere we've forgotten to check?
I looked in every mausoleum.
We opened the sarcophagi!
I tromped through the pumpkin patch.
I peeked behind the cyclops' eye.
I did! But he wasn't there.
It's time to sound the alarms!
Frog's breath will overpower any odor.
Bitter!
Worm's wart. But where, where is that worm's wart?
Sally? ls that soup ready yet?
Ah. Coming!
Lunch!
Ah, what's that?
Worm's wart! Mmm!
And frog's breath?
Wh-What's wrong? l-l thought you liked frog's breath.
Nothing's more suspicious than frog's breath.
Until you taste it,
I won't swallow a spoonful.
I'm not hungry. Oops.
You want me to starve... an old man like me, who hardly has strength as it is.
Me, to whom you owe your very life.
Oh, don't be silly.
Mmm! See? Scrumptious!
Did anyone think to dredge the lake?
Oh, this morning.
- Hear that?
- Ah, what?
- Shh.
Zero!
- Jack's back!
- Jack's back! Jack's back!
- Where have you been?
- Call a town meeting and I'll tell everyone all about it.
- When?
- Immediately!
Town meeting! Town meeting!
Town meeting tonight!
Town meeting!
Town meeting tonight!
Listen, everyone!
I want to tell you about Christmas Town.
There were objects so peculiar they were not to be believed
All around things to tantalize my brain
It's a world unlike anything
I've ever seen
And as hard as I tried
I can't seem to describe
Like a most improbable dream
But you must believe when I tell you this
It's as real as my skull and it does exist
Here, let me show you.
Ooh!
This is a thing called a present
The whole thing starts with a box
- A box
- Is it steel
- Are there locks
- Is it filled with a pox
- A pox, how delightful, a pox
If you please.
Just a box with bright colored paper
And the whole thing's topped with a bow
- A bow
- But why
- How ugly
- What's in it, what's in it
That's the point of the thing
Not to know
- It's a bat
- Will it bend
- It's a rat
- Will it break
Perhaps it's the head that I found in the lake
Listen now
You don't understand
That's not the point of Christmasland
Now pay attention
We pick up an oversized sock
And hang it like this on the wall
Oh, yes, does it still have a foot
- Let me see, let me look
- Is it rotted and covered with gook
Um, let me explain.
There's no foot inside but there's candy
- Or sometimes it's filled with small toys
- Small toys
- Do they bite
- Do they snap
- Or explode in the sack
Well, perhaps they just spring out and scare girls and boys
What a splendid idea
This Christmas sounds fun
I fully endorse it
Let's try it at once
Everyone, please
Now not so fast
There's something here that you don't quite grasp
I don't know.
Do you get it?
Well, I may as well give them what they want.
And the best I must confess
I have saved for the last
For the ruler of this Christmasland
Is a fearsome king with a deep, mighty voice
Least, that's what
I've come to understand
And I've also heard it told
That he's something to behold
Like a lobster huge and red
When he sets out to slay with his rain gear on
Carting bulging sacks with his big great arms
That is so I've heard it said
And on a dark cold night under full moonlight
He flies into a fog like a vulture in the sky
And they call him
Sandy Claws
Well, at least they're excited
But they don't understand
That special kind of feeling in Christmasland
Oh, well.
Hmm.
Hmm.
There's got to be a logical way to explain this Christmas thing.
You've poisoned me for the last time, you wretched girl.
Oh, my head!
The door is open!
- Hello!
- Jack Skellington!
- Up here, my boy.
- Doctor, I need to borrow some equipment.
Is that so? Whatever for?
I'm conducting a series of experiments.
How perfectly marvelous!
- Curiosity killed the cat, you know.
- I know.
Come on into the lab and we'll get you all fixed up.
Hmm. Experiments?
Zero, I'm home!
Interesting reaction!
But what does it mean?
You can come out now if you promise to behave.
Sally?
Sally?
Oh, gone again!
Hmm.
Oh!
Something's up with Jack
Something's up with Jack
Don't know if we're ever going to get him back
He's all alone up there locked away inside
- Never says a word
- Hope he hasn't died
Something's up with Jack
Something's up with Jack
Christmastime is buzzing in my skull
Will it let me be
I cannot tell
There's so many things
I cannot grasp
When I think I've got it and then at last
Through my bony fingers it does slip
Like a snowflake in a fiery grip
Something here I'm not quite getting
Though I try I keep forgetting
Like a memory long since past
Here in an instant
Gone in a flash
What does it mean
What does it mean
In these little bric-a-brac
A secret's waiting to be cracked
These dolls and toys confuse me so
Confound it all, I love it though
Simple objects, nothing more
But something's hidden through a door
Though I do not have the key
Something's here I cannot see
What does it mean
What does it mean
What does it mean
Hmm. Hmm.
I've read these Christmas books so many times
I know the stories and I know the rhymes
I know the Christmas carols all by heart
My skull's so full it's tearing me apart
As often as I've read them
Something's wrong
It's so hard to put my bony finger on
Or perhaps it's really not as deep as I've been led to think
Am I trying much too hard
Of course
I've been too close to see
The answer's right in front of me
Right in front of me
It's simple really, very clear
Like music drifting in the air
Invisible but everywhere
Just because I cannot see it
Doesn't mean I can't believe it
You know I think this Christmas thing is not as tricky as it seems
And why should they have all the fun
It should belong to anyone
Not anyone in fact, but me
Why I can make a Christmas tree
And there's no reason I can find
I couldn't handle Christmastime
I bet I could improve it too
And that's exactly what I'll do
Eureka!
This year,
Christmas will be ours!
Patience, everyone. Jack has a special job for each of you.
Dr. Beetlestein.
Your Christmas assignment is ready.
Dr. Beetlestein, to the front of the line.
What kind of noise is that for a baby to make?
- Perhaps it can be improved?
- No problem!
I knew it!
Doctor, thank you for coming.
We need some of these.
Hmm.
Their construction should be exceedingly simple, I think.
How horrible our Christmas will be.
No! How jolly!
Oh. How jolly our Christmas will be.
- What are you doing here?
- Jack sent for us.
- Specifically.
- By name.
- Lock.
- Shock.
- Barrel.
Jack, Jack, it's Boogie's boys.
Ah, Halloween's finest trick or treaters.
The job I have for you is top secret.
It requires craft, cunning, mischief.
And we thought you didn't like us, Jack.
Absolutely no one is to know about it. Not a soul!
Now.
Tree.
Christmas Town.
Ow! Hmm.
And one more thing.
Leave that no-account
Oogie Boogie out of this!
Whatever you say, Jack.
- Of course, Jack.
- Wouldn't dream of it, Jack.
Kidnap Mr. Sandy Claws
- I wanna do it
- Let's draw straws
- Jack said we should work together
- Three of a kind
- Birds of a feather
- Now and forever
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Lock him up real tight
Throw away the key and then turn off all the lights
First we're going to set some bait inside a nasty trap and wait
When he comes a-sniffing
We will snap the trap and close the gate
Wait, I've got a better plan to catch this big red lobster man
Let's pop him in a boiling pot
And when he's done we'll butter him up
Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Throw him in a box
Bury him for 90 years
Then see if he talks
And Mr. Oogie Boogie man
Can take the whole thing over then
He'll be so pleased I do declare
That he will cook him rare
Whee
I say that we take a cannon
Aim it at his door and then
Knock three times and when he answers
Sandy Claws will be no more
You're so stupid
Think now if we blow him up to smithereens
We may lose some pieces and then
Jack will beat us black and green
Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Tie him in a bag
Throw him in the ocean
Then see if he is sad
Because Mr. Oogie Boogie is the meanest guy around
- If I were on his boogie list
- I'd get out of town
He'll be so pleased by our success
That he'll reward us too
I'll bet
Perhaps he'll make his special brew
Of snake and spider stew
We're his little henchmen and we take our job with pride
We do our best to please him and stay on his good side
- I wish my cohorts weren't so dumb
- I'm not the dumb one
- You're no fun
- Shut up
- Make me
I've got something, listen now
This one is real good you'll see
We'll send a present to his door
Upon there'll be a note to read
Now in the box we'll wait and hide until his curiosity
Entices him to look inside and then we'll have him one, two, three
Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Beat him with a stick
Lock him up for 90 years
See what makes him tick
Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Chop him into bits
Mr. Oogie Boogie is sure to get his kicks
Kidnap the Sandy Claws
See what we will see
Lock him in a cage and then throw away the key
Sandy Claws, huh?
It goes something like this.
How about it?
Think you can manage?
A-one, and a-two, and a-three, and a--
- Next!
- Fantastic!
Now, why don't you all practice on that, and we'll be in great shape.
Sally, I need your help more than anyone's.
You certainly do, Jack.
I had the most terrible vision.
- That's splendid!
- No! It was about your Christmas.
- There was smoke and fire.
- That's not my Christmas.
My Christmas is filled with laughter and joy.
And this: my Sandy Claws outfit.
I want you to make it.
Jack, please listen to me.
It's going to be a disaster.
How could it be?
Just follow the pattern.
This part's red.
The trim is white.
- It's a mistake, Jack.
- Now, don't be modest.
Who else is clever enough to make my Sandy Claws outfit?
- Next!
- I have...
- Oh.
- every confidence in you.
But it seems wrong to me.
Very wrong.
This device is called a nutcracker.
Jack! Jack! We caught 'im!
We got 'im!
Perfect! Open it up. Quickly!
That's not Sandy Claws!
- It isn't?
- Who is it?
- Bunny!
- Eek! Ooh.
Not Sandy Claws! Take him back!
- We followed your instructions.
- We went through the door.
Which door?
There's more than one.
Sandy Claws is behind the door shaped like this.
I told you!
- You knock it off!
- Get-- Ow! Ow!
I'm very sorry for the inconvenience, sir.
Take him home first!
And apologize again.
Be careful with Sandy Claws when you fetch him.
- Treat him nicely.
- Got it.
We'll get it right next time.
You will be a decided improvement... over that treacherous Sally.
Master. The plans.
Excellent, lgor.
- What?
- What's goin' on?
This time
This time
Making Christmas
Making Christmas
Making Christmas
Making Christmas is so fine
It's ours this time
And won't the children be surprised
It's ours this time
- Making Christmas
- Making Christmas
- Making Christmas
Time to give them something fun
They'll talk about for years to come
- Let's have a cheer from everyone
- It's time to party
Making Christmas
Making Christmas
Snakes and mice get wrapped up so nice
With spider legs and pretty bows
It's ours this time
All together that and this
With all our tricks we're making Christmastime
Here comes Jack.
I don't believe what's happening to me
My hopes, my dreams
My fantasies
Won't they be impressed
I am a genius
See how I transform this old rat
Into a most delightful hat
- Hmm.
- My compliments from me to you on this your most intriguing hat
- Consider though this substitute
A bat in place of this old rat
- Huh!
No, no, no, now that's all wrong
This thing will never make a present
It's been dead for much too long
Try something fresher
Something pleasant
Try again
Don't give up
All together that and this
With all our tricks we're making Christmastime
- This time, this time
- It's ours
Making Christmas
Making Christmas
La, la, la
It's almost here and we can't wait
So ring the bells and celebrate
'Cause when the full moon starts to climb, we'll all sing out
It's Christmastime
Kathleen, Bobby, Susie.
Yes, Susie's been nice.
Nice, nice, naughty, nice, nice, nice--
There are hardly any naughty children this year.
Now, who could that be?
- Trick or treat!
- Huh?
Ya!
You don't look like yourself,
Jack, not at all.
Isn't that wonderful?
It couldn't be more wonderful!
But you're the Pumpkin King!
Not anymore.
And I feel so much better now!
Jack, I know you think something's missing, but--
- Ow!
- Sorry.
You're right.
Something is missing, but what?
I've got the beard, the coat, the boots, the belt--
- Jack, Jack, this time we bagged him.
- This time we really did!
- He sure is big, Jack!
- And heavy!
Let me out!
Sandy Claws in person!
What a pleasure to meet you!
Wh-- Why, you have hands!
- You don't have claws at all!
- Wha--
Where am l?
Surprised, aren't you?
I knew you would be.
You don't need to have another worry about Christmas this year.
- Wha-- Well, wha-- Wha--
- Consider this a vacation,
Sandy, a reward.
- It's your turn to take it easy.
- B-But there must be some mistake!
See that he's comfortable.
Just a second, fellas. Of course!
- That's what I'm missing!
- B-B-but--
- Thanks.
- Y-You just can't--
Hold on.
Where are we going now?
Ho, ho, ho! No.
- This is worse than I thought.
- Ho, ho, ho.
- Much worse.
- Ho, ho, ho!
- I know.
Me, on vacation?
On Christmas Eve?
- Where are we taking him?
- Where?
To Oogie Boogie, of course.
There isn't anywhere in the whole world more comfortable than that.
- And Jack said to make him comfortable, didn't he?
- Yes, he did.
Haven't you heard of peace on earth and goodwill toward men?
No!
Ah! This'll stop Jack.
What a joy to think of all we'll have in common.
We'll have conversations worth having!
Don't do this!
Naughty children never get any presents!
- I think he might be too big!
- Ooh!
No, he's not.
If he can go down a chimney... he can fit down here.
Well, well, well!
What have we here?
Sandy Claws, huh?
Oooh, I'm really scared!
So you're the one everybody's talkin' about.
You're jokin'
You're jokin'
I can't believe my eyes
You're jokin' me, you gotta be
This can't be the right guy
He's ancient, he's ugly
I don't know which is worse
I might just split a seam now if I don't die laughin' first
Mr. Oogie Boogie says there's trouble close at hand
You better pay attention now
'cause I'm the boogie man
And if you aren't shakin' there's somethin' very wrong
'Cause this may be the last time you hear the boogie song
- Whoa-oh
- Whoa-oh
- Whoa-oh
- Whoa-oh
- Whoa-oh
- Whoa-oh
- I'm the Oogie Boogie man
- He's the Oogie Boogie man
Release me now or you must face the dire consequences
The children are expecting me
So please, come to your senses
Ah, you're jokin'
You're jokin'
I can't believe my ears
Would someone shut this fella up
I'm drownin' in my tears
It's funny
I'm laughin'
You really are too much
And now with your permission
I'm going to do my stuff
- What are you going to do?
- I'm gonna do the best I can.
Whoa
The sound of rolling dice to me is music in the air
'Cause I'm a gamblin' boogie man although I don't play fair
It's much more fun
I must confess with lives on the line
Not mine, of course
But yours, old boy
Now that'd be just fine
Release me fast or you will have to answer for this heinous act
Oh, brother, you're somethin'
You put me in a spin
You aren't comprehending the position that you're in
It's hopeless, you're finished
You haven't got a prayer
'Cause I'm Mr. Oogie Boogie
And you ain't goin' nowhere
Whoa! It's Jack!
Think of us as you soar triumphantly through the sky... outshining every star... your silhouette a dark blot on the moon.
You, who are our pride.
You, who are our glory.
- You, who have frightened millions into an early grave.
- Ow!
You, who have, uh... devastated the, the souls of the living?
Oh, no! We can't take off in this.
- The reindeer can't see an inch in front of their noses.
- Whew!
This fog's as thick as, as--
- Jellied brains.
- Or thicker!
There go all of my hopes... my precious plans, my glorious dreams.
There goes Christmas.
No, Zero. Down, boy.
My, what a brilliant nose you have!
The better to light my way!
To the head of the team, Zero!
We're off!
Wait, Jack! No!
Ho-ho-ho!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ho!
Good-bye, Jack.
My dearest Jack.
Oh, how I hope my premonition is wrong.
I sense there's something in the wind
That feels like tragedy's at hand
And though I'd like to stand by him
Can't shake this feeling that I have
The worst is just around the bend
And does he notice
My feelings for him
And will he see
How much he means to me
I think it's not to be
What will become of my dear friend
Where will his actions lead us then
Although I'd like to join the crowd
In their enthusiastic cloud
Try as I may it doesn't last
And will we ever
End up together
No, I think not
It's never to become
For I am not the one
Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!
Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee!
Santa!
Santa?
Merry Christmas!
And what is your name?
- Uh, uh, uh, uh--
- That's all right.
I have a special present for you anyway. There you go, sonny.
Ho-ho-ho-ho!
Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee!
And what did Santa bring you, honey?
Merry Christmas!
Hello. Police.
Attacked by Christmas toys?
That's strange. That's the second toy complaint we've had.
Oh! Ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Oh! Ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Huh?
Oh, wait!
Whoa! Help! Help!
You're welcome, one and all!
Where'd you spot him?
Fast as we can, ma'am.
Police. I know. I know.
A skeleton. Keep calm.
Turn off all the lights. Make sure the doors are locked. Hello. Police.
Reports are pouring in from all over the globe... that an impostor is shamelessly impersonating Santa Claus... mocking and mangling this joyous holiday.
Authorities assure us that at this moment... military units are mobilizing to stop the perpetrator of this heinous crime.
- Jack! Someone has to help Jack.
- Wherever you are...
- Where'd they take that Sandy Claws?
- come back and save Christmas.
Look, Zero, searchlights!
They're celebrating!
They're thanking us for doing such a good job.
Whoa! Careful down there.
You almost hit us!
It's okay, Zero. Head higher.
Are you a gamblin' man, Sandy?
Let's play. Hmm?
My, my! What have we here?
I'll get you out of here.
Ah. Lovely.
Tickle, tickle, tickle.
Uh, tickle, tickle, tickle.
Tickle, tickle, tickle.
Tickle, tickle, tickle.
What? You try to make a dupe out of me!
Oh!
Who's next on my list?
Ah, little Harry and Jordan.
Won't they be surprised?
They're trying to hit us. Zero!
Merry Christmas to all... and to all a good night!
I knew this Christmas thing was a bad idea.
I felt it in my gut.
Terrible news, folks.
The worst tragedy of our times.
Jack has been blown to smithereens!
Terrible, terrible news!
Attention. Attention, citizens.
Terrible news. There's still no sign of Santa Claus.
Although the impostor has been shot down... it looks like Christmas will have to be cancelled this year.
I repeat, the impostor has been shot down... but there's still no sign yet of Santa.
What have I done
What have I done
How could I
Be so blind
All is lost
Where was I
Spoiled all
Spoiled all
Everything's
Gone all wrong
What have I done
What have I done
Find a deep cave to hide in
In a million years
They'll find me only dust
And a plaque that reads
Here lies poor old Jack
But I never intended all this madness
Never
And nobody really understood
Well, how could they
That all I ever wanted was to bring them something great
Why does nothing ever turn out like it should
Well, what the heck
I went and did my best
And by god
I really tasted something swell
And for a moment why, I even touched the sky
And at least I left some stories they can tell, I did
And for the first time since I don't remember when
I felt just like my old bony self again
And l, Jack
The Pumpkin King
That's right, I am the Pumpkin King
Ha-ha-ha-ha
And I just can't wait until next Halloween
'Cause I've got some new ideas that will really make them scream
And by god I'm really going to give it all my might
Uh-oh. I hope there's still time... to set things right.
Sandy Claws! Hmm.
You wait 'til Jack hears about this!
By the time he's through with you, you'll be lucky if you--
The King of Halloween... has been blown to smithereens.
Skeleton Jack is now a pile of dust.
Come on, Zero.
Christmas isn't over yet.
What's that you said about luck, rag doll?
Help! Help! Help!
Shh.
Looks like it's Oogie's turn to boogie now.
- Help!
- One, two, three... four, five, six, seven.
Help!
Ashes to ashes, and dust to dust.
Oh, I'm feeling weak with hunger!
One more roll of the dice oughta do it.
What? Snake eyes?
Eleven!
Looks like I won the jackpot!
Bye-bye, doll face and sandman.
What the--
- Hello, Oogie.
- J-J-J-Jack!
But they said you were dead.
You must be double dead!
Oh!
Well, come on, bone man!
Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo! Ha!
Fire!
Hmm. Ooh-ooh-ooh!
Jack, look out!
So long, Jack.
How dare you treat my friends so shamefully!
Now look what you've done!
My bugs! My bugs!
My bugs! My bugs! My bugs!
My bugs! My bugs! My bugs!
My bugs! My bugs!
Forgive me, Mr. Claws.
I'm afraid I've made a terrible mess of your holiday.
Bumpy sleigh ride, Jack?
The next time you get the urge to take over someone else's holiday, I'd listen to her.
She's the only one who makes any sense around this insane asylum.
- Skeletons! Boogie men! Ooh.
- I hope there's still time.
To fix Christmas?
Of course there is!
I'm Santa Claus.
He'll fix things, Jack.
He knows what to do.
How did you get down here, Sally?
Oh, l-l was trying to--
Well, I wanted to, to--
- To help me.
- I couldn't let you just--
Sally, I can't believe
I never realized that you--
- Jack! Jack!
- Here he is!
- Alive!
- Just like we said!
- Grab ahold, my boy!
Whoa!
Good news, folks. Santa Claus, the one and only, has finally been spotted.
Old Saint Nick appears to be traveling at supersonic speed.
He's setting things right, bringing joy and cheer wherever he goes.
Yes, folks, Kris Kringle has pulled it out of the bag... and delivered Christmas to excited children all over the world.
La, la, la, la
La-la-la-la
La, la, la, la
La-la-la-la
- Jack!
- Jack's back!
- Jack?
- Jack's okay!
- He's all right!
- It's Jack!
Jack's okay
And he's back
Oh, yea
He's all right
Let's shout, make a fuss
Scream it out, whee
Jack is back now
Everyone sing
In the town of Halloween
- It's great to be home!
- Ho-ho-ho-ho!
Happy Halloween!
Merry Christmas!
- What's this
- What's this
- I haven't got a clue
- What's this
- Why, it's completely new
What's this
Must be a Christmas thing
- What's this
- It's really very strange
This is Halloween
Halloween, Halloween, Halloween
What's this
What's this
Careful, my precious jewel.
My dearest friend if you don't mind
I'd like to join you by your side
Where we can gaze into the stars
And sit together
Now and forever
For it is plain
As anyone can see
We're simply meant to be
Maa-ax!
Roxanne?
What's wrong?
- Agh! No!
- Look!
Uh... Ahh!
Hello?
- Ahem. Hello.
- Max, where the heck are you, man?
- P.J.?
- You should've been here an hour ago.
What? What are...
Hold on. Oh, no!
Look, maybe we should just call the whole thing off.
No way, man.
It's now or never.
You better get a move on.
I'll meet you at my locker.
Ayuk!
Mornin', son!
Dad!
Oops!
I forgot.
Ayuk! Mornin', son!
Came to see if you had any... dirty clothes.
Well, there they are.
Help yourself.
Max, I thought we talked about this.
Look, I'm sorry, Dad.
I- I'll take care of it later. Ow!
- What's the big rush?
- I'm running late.
- Ooh. I could drive ya on my way to work.
- Uh, no. No, thanks.
- I, uh, need the exercise.
- Aw, come on, Max. Huh?
Dad!
No, don't do it!
Don't...
No!
Oh, Dad, you ruined it.
Sorry 'bout that.
Who was he, anyway?
It's only Powerline, Dad.
The biggest rock star on the planet.
Ooh, not bigger than
Xavier Cugat, the Mambo King.
Everybody mambo!
# Boom-boom-boom, boom-boom-boom #
- Dad, there's no time for this.
What if the neighbours see us?
- # Boom-boom-boom-boom #
# Boom-boom-boom #
Maxie, wait up!
You forgot your lunch.
- Have a good day!
- Duh... Ah!
Huh.
# They've been laughin' since I can remember #
# But they're not gonna laugh any more #
# No more "Maxie the Geek"
No more "Goof of the Week" #
# Like before #
# No more algebra tests

# She looked right through me #
# And who could blame her #
# I need a new me plus some positive proof that I'm not just a goof #
# And after today
I'm gonna be cruisin' #
# No more pep rallies to cut #
Yuck!
# After today our brains'll be snoozin' #
# I'm gonna sit on my butt #
# I've got less than an hour
And when this is ended #
- # I'll either be famous #
- # Or you'll be suspended #
# Just think of all the time
I've been losin' #
# Waiting until
I could say #
# Gonna be on my own
Kiss the parents goodbye #
# Gonna party from now
'til the end of July #
# Things'll be going my way #
# After today #
# I wish that this was the day after today ##
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, yeah. I'm okay.
I just, uh...
I can't believe
I did that!
Ah! She finally says
"hi" to me, and what do I do?
I... choke!
- Like a big spaz!
- Where have you been, buddy?
Ah. Hi, Peej.
Did you get the camera?
Look, Max, if my dad catches me with this, he'll kill me!
Are you sure we gotta do this?
It's my only chance, Peej.
To Roxanne, I'm...
I'm just a nobody.
But after today...
Bobby!
Wow, look!
All this is for us?
Mmm, slurpage!
Oh, this is gonna be so great, man!
Dah.
Need fund-age, bro.
Oh, your fee.
Yeah, yeah. Right here.
Cheddar!
Cheddar whizzy!
It's pretty scrumptious.
Let's do it, ladies!
As student body president,
I just wanna say like "yea"...
- to all of us for a really neat year.
- Yo, Stacey!
Talk to me, talk to me, talk to me, baby!
And also that I hope you can all attend my totally amazing end-of-school party... next Saturday to watch the Powerline concert live on pay-per-view.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
And now, without further ado,
Principal Mazur.
Thank you, Stacey.
And good morning, boys and girls.
You know, every year on the last day of school...
I have several youngsters approach me and say,
"Principal Mazur, what can we do to not waste our summer vacation?
- We don't want to waste our free time...
Sleeping or visiting friends."
Say, Roxanne, about Stacey's party.
How you, uh...
How you doin' down there, Bobby?
Don't give me that attitude, you guys.
I'm doin' it all for you.
This is nuts. I don't know why
I let you guys talk me into this.
If my dad finds out, he's gonna nuke my entire existence.
...of the element, or...
I hope this works.
How about science slumber parties? Wha...
Wha...
Hey!
I'm not gonna just...
# Some people settle for the typical things #
# Livin' all their lives waitin' in the wings #
# It ain't a question of "if"
It's a matter of time #
# Before I move to the front of the line #
# Once you're watchin' every move that I make #
# You gotta believe that I got what it takes #
# To stand out above the crowd #
# Even if I've gotta shout out loud #
# 'Til mine is the only face you'll see #
# Gonna stand out
'til you notice me, yeah #
A little smoke-ege!
Oou-ou-ou!
# If I can make you stop and take a look at me instead of just #
# Walkin' by #
# There's nothin' that I wouldn't do if it was gettin' you to notice #
# I'm alive #
# All I need is half a chance
A second thought, a second glance #
# To prove I've got whatever it takes #
It's a piece of cake.
# To stand out above the crowd #
Wow! Who's that guy?
# 'Til mine is the only face you'll see #
# Gonna stand out... #
Hey, it's the Goof boy!
We're busted!
Ayuk!
Come on, smile!
Smiley-wiley!
Oh, come on, Kimmie.
Gimme a big...
Stop goofin' around!
We got work to do!
Okay, Kimmie, back to Mommy now.
You're such a cute little girlie.
Oh, come back and see me.
Oh, you have such a way with children.
"You have such a way with children"!
Okay, now.
Who's next over here?
Step aside, Goof.
Let a pro show you how it's done.
Okay. Who's next over here?
Ooh, hello, precious...
You lucky woman.
Now, now, you come on here, honey.
- It's picture time. Come on.
- Peekaboo!
- She's so cute.
- Peekaboo!
Gosh, Pete, you sure are good with kids.
Oh, yeah. Well, they love me.
Ha-ha. Why P.J., he's been beggin' me to take him on vacation this summer.
Really?
Where ya goin'?
Campin'! Nothing like the great outdoors... to strengthen the bond between a father and a son.
Oh, Max'd never go for anything like that.
- Gimme, gimme.
- I don't know, Goof.
Somethin's wrong when a kid won't spend time with his parents.
Well, for all you know, he's runnin' around with some gang,
- and stealin' stuff, and causin' riots and...
- Whaaa! Gimme!
Oh, Max is a good kid.
He'd never get mixed up in somethin' like that.
I'm a failure. Complete loser.
My one chance to impress Roxanne, and I blew it.
Uh-huh!
Max, look.
It's the Leaning Tower of Cheese-a. Huh.
Oh, man! My dad is gonna smash me like a bug.
Hey, P.J., detention!
Ha-ha-ha!
Robert Zimuruski.
Okay. I'm comin'.
Max, here.
Guard this with your life, dude.
Hey, Maz-u-ur!
What's up, bro?
All right.
Then my parents' air conditioner went on the fritz.
I figured with all those kids in my house, the place would be like a sauna. So I freaked out.
Then I thought, like, use it.
So my theme's gonna be,
"Powerline Goes
Rain Forest."
Too much?
Roxanne, are you listening?
Oh!
- Stacey, no! I don't wanna...
- Talk to him.
A- Ahem!
A- A-Ahem!
Hmm.
Tap him.
- Gosh, I'm sorry.
- It's okay... really.
Um, I liked your dance.
Yeah. Yeah?
Yeah, it's from
Powerline's new video.
I know. H-He's totally a genius.
Yeah. H-He's doing a concert next week in L.A.
Oh, yeah.
Stacey's showing it at her party.
- Yeah!
- Yeah.
Um, uh,
Roxanne,
I was, uh, sorta, kinda thinkin' that maybe I'd, um, ask you to, uh, go with me, that is to the... party.
Of course if you don't want to,
I'd completely understand.
Well, I was sorta, kind of thinkin' that... I'd love to.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- Good.
- Great.
- Terrific.
- Wonderful.
- All right.
- Okay.
Come on, Roxanne. We don't want to belabor the moment now, do we?
Well, I'd better be going.
I'll, uh, call you later.
Okay.
Bye. Oh.
Bye.
See, that wasn't so bad.
I told you men were easy to deal with.
Yes!
She said yes!
Ya-ha-ha-hoo!
Everybody mambo!
# Rum-bum-bum-bum-dah #
Yeah! Dance with her!
Groove with her.
- Miss Maple!
- Yes, sir?
Get that boy's father on the phone at once!
Right away, sir!
Whoo!
Hello.
Ah, yes. Mr Goof, this is Principal Mazur.
I'm calling in regard to your son Maximilian.
Max? Oh, my gosh!
Is he hurt?
No, Mr Goof.
He's in trouble!
Trouble?
What kind of trouble?
- Dressed like a gang member.
- Gang member?
Your son caused the entire student body... to break into a riotous frenzy!
- Riot? Couldn't be my...
- If I were you, Mr Goof,
I'd seriously reevaluate the way you're raising your child... before he ends up in the electric chair!
The electric chair?
What am I gonna do?
Blue light special on aisle three.
Blue light special on aisle three.
Lake Destiny.
Okay, kiddo.
Now, smile!
Lake Destiny, Idaho!
- Lake who-did-ho?
- You were right, Pete.
Nothin' like the great outdoors to strengthen the bond between father and son.
- You said so yourself.
- Well, yeah, but...
I'm goin' fishin'!
I'm goin' fishin' with my boy!
Yeah. Okay, precious.
Gimme a big smi...
Fishing! Fishing!
Ha-ha-ha-ha!
Cool concert, lad.
- What?
- You wailed, bud!
- Hey, Max, wicked dance.
- Thanks.
Forget it, girl.
He's Roxanne's.
Way to go, man!
I just heard about you and Roxanne.
Oh, Pete!
Ow!
See, see? I told you our plan would work!
- Max! Max! Max!
- Peej, knock it off. Come on. Shh.
- Maximum! Maxi-mu-um!
- Max! Max!
Max! Max!
Max! Max! Max!
Max! Max! Max!
Yea!
# All I need is half a chance

# Stand out

# Gonna stand out ##
'Til you notice me.
Goin' somewhere, Pop?
- Sure are, pal-a-roony.
- Cool. Have a good time, Dad.
If you're gonna be gone more than a month, drop me a line.
But, Max, this isn't just my vacation.
It's a vacation with me and my best buddy.
- Oh, Donald Duck?
- No, silly. With you!
Are you okay, Maxie?
Wh-What did you say?
That's right!
A vacation, son!
We'll spend some real quality time together!
I think I'm gonna be sick.
Hey, got a present for ya!
Dad, stop that!
What are you doing?
You look just like I did at your age.
Please don't say that,
Dad.
Wait! I saved the best for last.
It's been handed down from Goof to Goof to Goof.
And now, it's yours, son.
- A stick?
- No, silly.
A fishin' pole!
Fishing?
We're going fishing?
Yep. Just like my dad and me did.
Two best buddies fishin' on Lake Destiny.
Away from it all!
I don't wanna be
"away" from it all, Dad.
I like "it all"!
Look, Maxie, we're using the same map me and my dad used.
We'll take the same route, and make the same stops... and see the same sights.
- But that trip would take weeks, Dad!
- Exactly!
- Gettin' there is half the fun.
- Put the map away, Dad.
- It's not gonna happen. I'm tellin' ya...
- Be careful, son.
You'll wrinkle my past.
Ayuk! And our future.
What the map says, Max, we will follow.
That's very mystical and everything, Dad, but, uh, seriously, there's this party
I have to go to, see?
- And there's this girl...
- Oh, there'll be plenty of time for parties when you're older.
Why, when I was your age
I'd never even been invited to a party.
- Look at me now!
- Great, Dad.
- Hop in, Maxie.
- No!
All right, then.
Guess I'll just have to go... all alone.
That's all.
Just sit in the boat... all alone... and talk to myself.
- All alone.
- I guess so.
- Oh, come on! Hop in!
- No, Dad.
- Just hop right in there.
- No.
- Come on, Maxie. Go for it!
- Agh! No.
Let's buckle you up!
And we're ready for takeoff!
Set for adventure,
Maxie?
Why are you doing this to me, Dad?
'Cause I don't want ya to end up in the electric chair.
Electric chair?
What are you...
I'm not givin' up on ya, son.
Together, we're gonna work this out.
Work this out?
But, Dad!
No buts about it,
Maxie boy.
- Your ol' pop knows best.
- But...
Goodbye, house.
Goodbye, mailbox.
Goodbye, pile of broken wood.
Goodbye, hopes.
Goodbye, dreams.
Goodbye, Roxanne.
Roxanne!
Dad, I gotta stop somewhere first.
I have to talk to someone.
- Well...
- Turn here!
D- Dad, watch out!
Stop here.
Here! Pull over!
Now, make it quick, Maxie boy.
We gotta put some road behind us.
You get and cancel your first date in less than an hour.
Must be some kind of lame-o record.
Grrr.
Hi. Is Roxanne home?
Grrr.
M-M-My name's Max.
Does Roxanne live here?
- Does she even live on this block? Ha-ha.
- Wait!
It's okay, Daddy.
Max is a friend from school.
Go on. Go on.
Good Daddy.
- Hey, Max.
- Hi, there.
You wanna... uh, have a seat?
Hey. Uh, u-u-oh.
- Grrr.
- Daddy!
I promise, he'll be better behaved when you pick me up for the party.
Yeah, that's, uh, sorta why I came by.
I'm really looking forward to it, Max.
- Yeah. I was too.
- Was?
You see, my dad's on this stupid father-son kick and...
Don't worry about it, Max.
It's just a dumb party.
No, it's not. Roxanne,
I really wanted to go with you.
- No, Max, I understand.
Really, it's okay.
- But my dad surprised me.
- These things happen.
- I don't wanna go, but I have no choice.
- I'm sure I can find someone else.
- Someone else?
- I'll just talk to you later.
- Uh, uh, Roxanne!
Uh, my dad is, uh...
My dad's taking me to the Powerline concert in L.A.
Your dad's taking you clear across the country just to see a concert?
Uh, well, you see, uh, my dad... uh, knew... knows, knows Powerline.
They used to play together in a band!
- Yeah!
- Come on, son!
Let's get this show on the road!
Uh, ha!
Just a minute!
You... party animal, you.
- You're really serious.
- Absolutely.
So, uh, you aren't still thinkin' of goin' with someone else, are you?
- Well, I guess...
- Because I was hopin'...
I could, uh, wave to you onstage... when we join Powerline for the final number.
This is incredible.
Well, I wouldn't miss our date for anything that wasn't incredible, Roxanne.
Have a great time at the concert, Max.
I'll see you on TV!
Ah. I'm in deep sludge.
Day one.
Well, here we are, out on the open road, retracin' the steps of my boyhood.
And here's Maxie!
Say hi, Max.
- Well, how 'bout a wave?
- Not now, Dad.
Ayuk! What a kidder!
Fun games I used to play with my dad.
Road bingo. Twenty ques...
Aah! Hey, Maxie.
Let's play a game.
You think of a name, and I'll try and guess who it is.
- Uh, man or woman?
- Oh, man.
A man, huh?
Hmm, that's a toughie.
Uh, let's see.
- Walt Disney!
- Right.
I'm good at this.
Now, uh, I'll think of one.
Hmm.
Oh! You wanna sing a song, huh?
Me and my dad used to sing this one all the time.
# High hopes #
# He's got high hopes #
# He's got high apple pie #
# In the sky hopes #
# Oops, there goes another... #
# Oops, there goes... #
# Oops, there goes... #
# Oops... #
Oh, g-great, Dad.
Now we don't have any music!
Oh, Maxie.
It's not so bad.
We'll just have to entertain ourselves!
Putt-putt-poof!
Putt-putt-poof!
- Ping-ping-ping.
- Putt-putt-poof!
Ping-ping-ping. Ping-ping-ping.
- Ping-ping-ping.
- Putt-putt-poof.
- Ping-ping-ping.
- Putt-putt-poof.
# Do ya need a break from modern livin' #
# Do you long to shed your weary load #
# If your nerves are raw and your brain is fried #
# Just grab a friend and take a ride together #
# On the open road #
Come on, Maxie!
# All in all
I'd rather have detention #
# All in all
I'd rather eat a toad #
Yuck!
# Old man drives like such a klutz #
# That I'm about to hurl my guts directly #
# Upon the open road #
# There's nothin' can upset me
'cause now we're on our way #
# Our trusty map will guide us straight and true #
# Roxanne, please don't forget me
I will return someday #
# Though I may be in traction when I do #
- # Me and Max relaxin' like the old days #
- # This is worse #
- # Than dragon breath and acne #
- # In a buddy-buddy kind of way #
# I'm so mad I think
I may explode #
- # When I see that highway I could cry #
- # That's funny, so could I #
# Just bein' out on the open road #
# Howdy, boys
Is this the way to Nashville #
Watch it, Mac!
# Or you'll be gettin' towed #
# I'm in no hurry to arrive #
# 'Cause I'll be turnin' sixty-five #
# The next time I sees the open road #
- # Just a week of rest and relaxation #
- Yeah!
# And the odd romantic episode #
Very odd!
# And it's Califor-ni-a or bust #
# Look out, you dirtbags
Eat my dust #
# From now on
I own the open road #
# It's me and little Maxie
My pip-squeak pioneer #
# They're partners forever
Westward ho #
- Yee-haw!
- Yee-haw!
# Could someone call a taxi and get me outta here #
# To Beverly Hills
# Oh, every day another new adventure #
# Every mile another new zip code #
# And the cares we had are gone for good #
# And I'd go with them if I could #
# I got no strings on me
I'm feelin' fancy free #
# How wonderful to be #
# On the open road #
# Ro-oad ##
# You'll all do-do-do-do #
# Do-do-do Bum-bum-bum #
Grandpa!
Grandpa!
Dad, you're gonna get us killed!
- Why don't you just give me the map?
- Oh, no thanks, son.
Navigating's a big responsibility.
Besides, you wouldn't wanna spoil the big surprise!
I'm takin' you someplace pretty special.
Gosh! It's even better than I remembered.
No, Mommy! I don't wanna go!
Yeah, fun.
Tell you what.
- I'm just gonna wait right here in the car.
You party pooper! Come on.
This is gonna be fun!
Oh, howdy there, folks.
Lester's is proud to present... the Possum Posse
Jamboree.
Here it is.
Oh, boy!
Just in time.
Howdy, folks.
Who's your favourite possum?
Lester!
Got us a seat right up front.
Let me introduce you to the posse.
Here's Beuford, Beulah and Mordachai.
Hey, Lester, ready for yodelin'?
Ha-ha-ha.
Sure am, Beuford!
# Now gather 'round my possum pals
Join the jamboree #
- # Come hoot and howl and holler from the heart #
- Ya-hoo!
This is pathetic.
- # Here in Lester's Possum Park #
- Join in, folks.
This is yodelin' time!
# Lester's Possum Park #

# Here at Lester's

# Po-Possum Park #
# Doodle-do
Diddle-do ##
Hey, that's the ticket!
I'll be right back, my little possum pal.
My life's a living...
Hello, little buddy!
Who's your favourite possum?
Don't touch me.
Aw. Why such a long face?
You're so sad.
I know! You need a big hug from Lester.
- Don't even think about it! Agh! No!
- See?
Now you feel all good inside.
Beat it, doofus!
- Oh, no. No, Dad. Not that. Please.
- Here you go, sport.
What say we get our picture taken?
- You have got to be kidding.
- Oh, all right.
But you're missin' out.
Hiya, son!
Hey, everyone!
Check out the dork!
Say "sassafras."
Sassy-frass!
Screech!
Ahh! Get it! Get it!
That's the spirit,
Maxie!
Whoa! No!
Dad, stop! Please!
No!
Dad, look, this is embarrassing.
No, no, no!
Let go! Dad!
It's dork and dork, junior!
- Agh!
- Max!
Hey, what the heck you tryin' to do?
- Trying to get away from you!
- Me?
- What'd I do?
- Forget it!
I thought we was having fun.
What's the matter?
Nothin'.
Let's just go.
Well, come on!
Hey, you dropped your hat.
Aah! This is the stupidest vacation!
You drag me from home, you jam me in this dumb car, then drive me a million miles away to see some stupid rat show!
Call me when the trip's over.
Hey, Max. You wanna get in some fishin' practise?
Just a couple of days
'til we get to Lake Destiny.
Maybe later.
Whoa!
Now that's camping.
Did you say somethin',
Max? Ow!
- Pete?
- Goofy?
Oh-ho!
What a serendipity doo-dah!
Who'd've thunk it, huh?
Ha-ha.
- Is P.J. Here?
- Who? Oh, yeah.
I'm sure he's loafin' around here somewhere.
# It ain't a question of how
Just a matter of when #
- # You get the message that I'm trying to sing #
- Ooh, ooh, that baby.
# I'm under a spell
I'm in over my head #
- # And you know I'm goin' all of the way to the end #
- What a goob!
# To stand out above the crowd #
# Even if you got to shout out loud #
# No matter what the look is
Max, I get... #
- Max!
- H-H-Hey!
Whoa!
Small wilderness, dude.
- Didn't expect to run into you.
- Apparently not.
You're just jealous, man,
'cause you ain't got the moves!
Yeah, you can keep the moves.
But I wouldn't mind havin' this R.V. Oh!
- You are so lucky, man.
- Me? Oh, come on. You're the star.
- Wh-What do you...
- Going to the Powerline concert.
- Ah! It's unbelievable, man.
- Who told you about that?
Hey, come on. Everybody in town knows about it, Max.
You are gonna be famous, buddy.
Especially with Roxanne.
There's, uh, only one person who doesn't know about it yet, Peej.
- Who?
- My dad.
So tell me, Goof, is that kid of yours still givin' you guff?
Oh, I don't know what's wrong.
Just seems like everything I try only drives Max further away.
Maybe I oughta just back off.
I don't know.
Wrong, Goof.
Look, if you keep 'em under your thumb, they'll never end up in the gutter.
Too bad, Pete.
Almost.
Almost? Hah!
Watch this.
P.J.!
Here, sir. Comin', sir. Yes, sir.
Whoo-hoo!
Strike-ola!
Yee-haw! Thank you.
Thank you. Yes!
And the crowd goes wild!
Ahh-ha-ha-ha!
High five, son!
Psych!
Ha-ha-ha-ha!
Say, Goof, why don't you two stay for dinner?
- Cool!
- Oh, no thanks, Pete.
- Max and I have some fish to catch.
- Dad, we can do that tomorrow.
So, uh, what're we havin'?
- But, Max, I thought...
- A-A-Ahem! Under your thumb, Goof.
- Maximilian!
- What?
Get your gear, little man.
We're goin' fishin'!
And I mean now!
Dad, I don't even know how to fish.
Oh, now come on.
That never stopped me!
Let me show you a little family secret... handed down through about
12 or 13 Goof generations.
- The perfect cast!
- The perfect what?
The perfect cast. My dad taught it to me when I was about your age.
Okay now, watch carefully.
You gotta be l-l-loose.
Relaxed... with your feet apart.
And... 10:00,
Quarter to 3:00.
Tour jete.
Twist. Over.
Pas de deux.
# I'm a little teapot #
And the windup!
And let her fly!
The perfect cast.
And now we reel her in.
Quick, get the camera!
Must be over three pounds.
I don't wanna miss this!
Look, Max!
A... duh, duh, Dad?
It's Bigfoot!
Could you back up a bit, Mr Foot?
You're out of focus.
What's the idea?
Bigfoot!
Behold the legendary Bigfoot!
Fabled, but seldom...
Yeow-hoo-hoo!
- It's locked!
- Quick! The sunroof!
Hurry up!
Hurry up!
I can't believe it!
Bigfoot!
And I got the only video!
We're gonna be famous!
Huh? Grrr.
Let's just get outta here.
Is he gone yet?
Nope. He's still here.
- Gee, Max, was that Bigfoot or your stomach?
Man, I'm starving.
Alphabet soup comin' up.
Uh, Dad?
Dad!
Stop playing around!
He's coming!
Music!
# You can tell by the way
I use my walk I'm a woman's man #
# No time to talk #
# I've been kicked around since I was born #
# But then it's all right
It's okay #
Well, it's nice to know this thing's good for somethin'.
#Stayin' alive, stayin' alive #
#Stayin' alive #
What's so funny?
"Hi, Dad" soup.
Don't tell me you don't remember
"Hi, Dad" soup!
Oh, come on.
Sure you do!
You used to spell things out using the letters, like, uh, "Hi, Dad,"
- or Maxie, or...
- Ambidextrous?
Yeah! That's...
Huh?
No!
Little words like...
- Hasta la vista?
- Like bye-bye.
- Or "I pledge allegiance"...
- Ayuk-ayuk. Or "I love you"...
Is, uh... is it soup yet?
Oh, oh.
I almost forgot.
Whoa!
Where'd you learn to do that?
Your granddad taught me that when we went to Yosemite.
You two did a lot together, huh?
Yep.
- Max, you and I...
- Dad, I'm sorry...
Um, um... how's the soup?
Not bad.
Um, not... Ahem.
- What?
- N-nothin'.
Well, we might as well get some shuteye.
I don't think we're goin' anywhere tonight.
Hi, Maxie.
"Dear Roxanne,
I couldn't sleep... so I thought I'd drop you a line.
Dad and I are having a great time!
We're only days away from L. A... and I can hardly wait for the big concert."
Ahh.
More "Hi, Dad" soup, please.
"Dear Roxanne, sorry I lied, but I'm not really going to the Powerline concert.
You may never want to see me again..."
Oh, man!
I'm dead no matter what I do!
How many cups of sugar does it take to get to the moon?
Ah... three and a half?
- Pickup.
- Hold your horses.
- Short stack?
- Right here.
Here you go, hun.
Eggs?
Eggs?
- Eggs!
- Uh-oh, yeah, yeah. Right here. Sorry.
Here you go, cutie.
- Max, I think we need to talk about this.
- Huh?
Seems to me you need to start taking some responsibility around here.
Excuse me. Can I have your attention, please?
A- A-Ahem!
I, Goofy, hereby dub my son
Maximilian...
Official Navigator and Head
"Which-Wayer" of this here road trip.
- Isn't that nice?
- Hee-haw!
- Seriously?
- I'm not even lookin' at the map any more.
As a matter of fact, you can pick all the stops from here to Lake Destiny.
I trust you wholeheartedly, son.
To the open road!
To the... open road!
Oh boy!
Gosh!
Check out the bed!
Check out the dresser!
Coral!
Nice lamp.
Classy choice there, navigator.
This is the police!
We've got the place surrounded, see?
You Goofs come out with your hands up.
You should've seen the look on your face!
- You really had him fooled, Pete!
- Me?
You jumped outta your skin!
I was just pretendin' for your sake.
- All right, sure!
- Did too!
- Did not!
Oh, ain't this sweet?
Don't let him fool you with that buddy-buddy act now. Under your thumb!
So... since we're all bein' palsy-walsy here,
- how 'bout lettin' me hook up the R.V.
- Well...
- Oh, it's just a little tiny extension cord. You'll hardly even notice it.
- Okay.
Great!
P.J.!
Hey, Goof, why don't you order us a pizza? This might take a while.
- No, I mean it... Ahh!
- Here you go, kids.
I'm gonna check out the hot tub.
- Okay, sir.
- All right.
I can't believe you, man.
Whatever made you think your dad would fall for a stupid idea like that?
- It wasn't stupid!
- Come on! It was really stupid.
Changing the map?
I didn't know what I was doin', all right? I-I was panicked.
Oof-oof-oof.
Oh-oh-ah-ah!
Ahh!
Taking a break from the M.T.V. Generation, huh?
Can't say as I blame ya.
People are always puttin' too much water in these things.
So, um... you and your son seem to be, uh, gettin' along just hunky-dory, huh?
Yeah!
It's been great!
You know, it's funny, but none of your techniques worked for me.
The harder I tried, the worse it got.
- Once I eased up, things just clicked!
- Oh, that's swell.
So, there's no problems then, huh?
Not a one!
That's uh...
I just hate to be...
- the bearer of bad news, but uh...
- What is it, Pete?
- Your kid's dupin' ya.
- What do you mean?
Well, I heard the little mutant tellin'
P.J. That he changed the map, so you're headin' straight to L.A., pal.
- What?
- Ahh, you tried, Goof.
- He's just a bad kid, that's all.
- I don't believe you.
- What?
- I don't believe ya, Pete!
Well hey, don't take my word for it.
Check your map.
I don't need to check the map.
I trust my son.
You know, maybe Max isn't all the things that you think a son should be.
But... he loves me.
Hey, my son respects me!
Yeah.
Check the map, Goof!
Hi, Dad.
Sorry about the mess.
I- I'll clean it up.
- Me think I better go.
- See ya, Peej.
- Don't forget... Powerline!
- Shh!
Well, here you go, navigator.
Just follow my route on the map, son.
Okay.
Here comes our junction.
Okay, Max, now this is it.
Left or right?
Uh...
Come on, Max!
Uh, l-left!
Uh... how 'bout a song, Dad?
Uh... a game? A game. Yeah!
Yeah, a game. Okay.
Uh... a man or woman?
A man? Man, okay.
Uh... Walt Disney!
Dad... listen, about my directions...
Will you listen to me?
I gotta tell you somethin', Dad.
Why bother? I'm probably too stupid to understand anyway.
Right?
Ahh, forget it.
H- H-Hey, the car!
- What? Now you want to drive too?
- No, Dad.
The car! Look!
The car!
- What'd you do now, Max?
- I didn't do anything, Dad.
I only touched it.
W- W-Whoa!
You locked it!
I locked it? It's your door.
You locked it.
Well, you distracted me.
Whoa!
You should've put the brake on.
Why don't you just put it on yourself?
See?
You ruin everything.
W- well, y-you r-ruined the vacation.
I ruined it?
- I never... wanted to go... on this stupid... vacationnnnnn!
Ahh! Ahh!
- Now look where you've got us, Dad!
- Where I got us?
- You should've let me stay at home.
- Why?
So you'd end up in prison?
Prison?
What are you talkin' about?
- Your principal called me.
- It's not what you think.
You even lied to me!
I had to!
You were ruining my life.
I was only tryin' to take my boy fishin', okay?
I'm not your little boy any more, Dad!
I've grown up.
I've got my own life now.
I know that!
I just wanted to be part of it.
You're my son, Max.
No matter how big you get, you'll always be my son.
# There are times you drive me, shall we say, bananas #
- # And your mind is missin', no offence, a screw #
- None taken.
# Still whatever mess
I land in #
# Who is always understandin' #
# Nobody else but you #
# Oh, your moodiness is now and then bewilderin' #
# And your values may be, so to speak, askew #
- Gesundheit.
- Thanks.
# Who deserves a hero's trophy #
# As we face each "catastro-phee" #
# Nobody else but you #
# Nobody else but you #
# It's just our luck #
# We're stuck together #
# Nobody else but you #
# Is crazy enough to believe we'll come through #
# So your jokes are all, let's face it, prehistoric #

# But when I start to sink #
# Hey, I'd rather go down #
# With nobody else #
# But Y-O-U ##
Aw, Dad!
Anyway, I figure she's never gonna want to talk to me again, much less go out with me.
- What a dumb lie, huh?
- What do you know?
My Maxie... in love.
Gosh, you're really growin' up.
It happened so fast...
I guess I sort of missed it.
Well, I think the only thing for us to do now... is to get you up onstage with this Powerline feller.
Uh, how are we gonna do that?
- Well, you just leave that up to me.
- No, Dad, really,
I- I think we should just, you know, forget it.
Now how come you always think I'm gonna lead you into some sort of calamity?
Uh, uh, Dad? Dad?
- What's wrong now?
- Look!
A waterfall!
Waterfall!
Dad!
Max!
Grab ahold, Max!
No!
No!
Dad!
Tour jete.
Twist. # I'm a little teapot #
Let her fly!
The perfect cast.
Boy, this has been one crazy vacation.
And it's not over yet!
- Dad.
- Oof. We made it!
Come on, Max.
Let's get you onstage.
- Maybe this isn't such a good idea.
- # Yeah, yeah #
Ooh, then again...
Dad? Dad!
# Hey yeah #
# I got myself a notion #
# One I know that you'll understand #
# We set the world in motion #
# By reaching out for each other's hand #
- Dad?
- # Maybe we'll discover #
# What we should have known all along #
- What are you doin' here? Hey!
- # Yeah #
- Max? Max?
- # One way or another #
# Together's where we both belong #
# If we listen to each other's heart #
# We'll find we're never too far apart #
# And maybe love is the reason why #
# For the first time ever we're seein' it 1-2-1I #
That Goof kid ain't there.
Don't worry, he'll be there.
# Seein' it l-2-I
Seein' it l-2-I #
Excuse me.
# Seein' it l-2-I #
- # I think we're seein' it #
- Max?
Hey, Dad. Dad!
Do the perfect cast.
# If you're ever lonely #
# Stop
You don't have to be #
# After all it's only a beat away from you to me #
# Take a look inside to see #
# Yeah, if we listen to each other's heart #
Yeah! Max is on the tube!
That's Max. I know him!
# And maybe love is the reason why #
# For the first time ever we're seein' it l-2-I #
He did it!
# Seein' it l-2-I #
# Seein' it l-2-I, baby #
- # For the first time #
- # For the first time #
- # Seein' it, seein' it, baby #
- Yeah!
# Yeah, yeah #
- # For the first time ever
Yeah, yeah, yeah #
- # Come on, baby #
- # l-2-I #
- # l-2-I #
# l-2-I #
# Yeah ##
You're doin' the right thing, son.
Yeah, I know. But she'll probably never talk to me again.
Well, if she doesn't, maybe she's just not the one for you.
That's what I'm afraid of.
Grrr.
Ah, hi!
Remember me?
Daddy!
Max, I saw you on TV.
You were great!
Yeah?
I mean, no, no.
I mean, uh...
Roxanne, I lied to you.
I don't even know Powerline.
What are you talking about?
A billion people saw you dance with him.
Yeah, well...
I never met him before... the concert, that is.
You mean that story about Powerline and your dad?
- Why would you make up something like that?
- I don't know.
I guess I just... wanted you to like me.
I already liked you,
Max.
From the very first time
I heard you laugh.
"Ayuk."
- So, you wanna do something tonight?
- Definitely!
- Oh! Oh, no, I can't. I can't.
- What?
Well, I'm kinda doin' somethin' with my dad.
Honest!
- How 'bout tomorrow?
- Deal.
Roxanne, I'd like you to meet my dad.
Enchante, mademoiselle.

Yeow-hoo-hoo-hooee!
Alan, every ten-year-old is afraid of something.
The kid's afraid of tuna-fish sandwiches.
Mercury levels in the tuna.
Whatever.
Alan, the world is a frightening place to him right now.
I think we could be a little more supportive.
Supportive? I'm the most supportive father on earth, but I'm running out of supportive things to do.
I signed him up for Little
League, he drove everybody crazy with statistics about how you can develop tumors from being hit in the head with a ball.
Did you know that shin splints can lead to blood clots in the legs?
Claire, he brought in a medical journal.
Nobody wanted to play after that.
And now I'm building him a tree house, in a tree he refuses to climb.
You know he hates heights.
I don't know. I just want to be a good father.
But you are a good father.
I'm OK! I'm OK!
Aah! No, I'm not!
Hey. Rich!
Well?
You like it?
Uh, yeah, it's great, Dad.
Hey, how about bringing me up that bag of nails?
No, come on up!
Look. Solid as a rock.
Dad, eight percent of all household accidents involve ladders.
Another three percent involve trees.
We're looking at 11 percent probability here.
Fine. Just put the bag in the bucket, OK?
- Rich.
- Huh?
Ow!
Oh! Oh!
Dad! Do you have feeling in your toes?
Yes, I have feeling in my toes.
Oh, Alan, honey, are you OK?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Fine. Oh!
Can't argue with statistics, Dad.
Statistics. Here's something you can do, go down to Gutman's Hardware
Store, buy a pound of these.
But, Dad...
Son, you can't live your life based on statistics.
You've gotta take some chances.
Now come on, buddy.
You can do this.
This is not good.
Definitely not good.
- All right!
- Whoa! Good one!
You went further that time.
- All right! Way to go, dude!
- All right, line it up.
Hey, guys, look, it's Richie Tyler.
Hey, check out his clothes. Hey,
Tyler, where you going, the moon?
Get cable in that thing, Tyler?
Hey, what's the matter, you chicken?
What's the matter, wuss, forgot your training wheels?
Uhh!
Uhh!
No cranial damage.
Oh!
Hello?
Welcome to the library, young man.
Don't tell me. You're here for a special book.
- Mister...
- Stop, stop, stop. Allow me to guess.
I have a talent for guessing what people need.
You're in need of... a fantasy.
Brave knights, mythical fairies, ferocious dragons.
Look, all I want is...
Adventure!
Of course. You're a boy who loves adventure!
Brimming with wicked demons, cutthroat pirates...
No, no, that's not it.
Horror!
Horror! Evil demons!
Wretched monsters! Haunted houses!
Graveyards!
Yes.
It's horror for you, boy.
I'm sure of it.
Your library card, please.
I don't have one.
You do now.
Sign here.
Richard Tyler.
Consider this your passport to the wonderful, quite unpredictable world of books.
But I don't want any books.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
I only came in here 'cause of the storm.
You mean you don't need...
Oh.
I see.
Is there a phone where
I can call my parents?
Through there.
Proceed in a northeasterly direction until you get to the rotunda, and from there head west through the fiction section.
And you'll find it. A public telephone. You can't miss it.
Don't be afraid, boy.
If you lose your way, merely direct yourself back to the exit sign.
Wow!
Jeez!
Whoa! Oh!
Hello?
Uh-oh.
Huh?
Oh! Uhh!
Uhh!
Help!
Mister, mister, where's the exit?
Help!
Wha...
Huh?
I'm... I'm a cartoon!
You... are an illustration.
Who... who are you?
I am the Pagemaster, keeper of the books and guardian of the written word.
You're the guy from up there!
Where are the others?
Why, they're here, of course! And all around.
Maybe you can show me the way out?
Follow me.
I-Is that the way?
Oh, the only way.
Fiction, A to Z!
Where all is possible!
Where a boy's imagination can take root and grow to incredible heights!
Where a boy's courage is a wind that moves him to discovery!
And where your journey begins!
Uhh!
Whoa!
To find your way home, you must face three tests, horror, adventure and fantasy.
And remember this, when in doubt, look to the books!
Aah! How do you stop this thing?
I am the ghost of Christmas past...
All the pirates shared a grave.
Due to the storm, all lines have been temporarily disconnected.
Please try your call again later.
Oh! Ow!
This is not good.
Definitely not good at all.
Where's the son of a sea biscuit knocked me from me crow's nest?
Where's he be? Where's he be?
So here be the lubber who knocked me on me poop deck, and with no apologies too!
You fiction or nonfiction?
I'm... Richard. Richard Tyler.
- What kind of a book would that be?
- Uh, I'm not a book.
Got any proof?
See? Here's my name!
A library card!
Oh, begging your pardon, lad.
I didn't know you was a customer!
Uh, look, all I wanna do is get outta here.
Of course you do, matey! We all do.
But this is a library, mate.
Not everything's as it seems.
Look to the books.
Look to the books.
You... you said you knew the way out?
I know these waters like the back of me hook!
Uh... Uh...
This way.
I gotta get home.
My parents are probably worried sick about me.
Well, I'm afeared
I've been dry-docked in this library far longer than I'd like to remember.
As I sees it, you with your library card are me ticket out of here!
Is it a deal, matey?
Ooh, I'm naked.
Uh, yeah, I guess so.
That's the spirit, lad!
Can we get going now?
Aye aye! Let's scale this mast and get our bearings!
Mast? That's a ladder. I kind of have this thing about heights.
Huh. I'll take care of that.
Mysterious Island. Yes.
Kidnapped.
Ah, here we be! 20,000
Leagues Under the Sea.
Ah, the squid, yes, that's it!
It's a giant squid!
Ah!
Whoa!
Ohh!
Jump, boy!
It's jump for your life!
Ohh!
Uhh!
Let go of my face! I can't breathe!
What are you doing, grabbing me like that and messing up my pantyhose?
Hmph! Now I gotta straighten out my Little Mermaid underwear.
Who... who are you?
I'm Fantasy. Oh!
I'm Fantasy! What is this?
Hm.
It's a library card.
I'm a book, honey. I can read.
Now tell me, what's the one thing you wish for more than anything in the world?
Anything in the world?
L-I'd like to get out of here.
I'll grant your wish, child. But you must do me one small kindness in return.
You gotta check me outta here!
That's it? OK, let's go!
Do I have to click my heels or something?
Honey, you in the wrong story.
That was a close one, lad. Lad?
Hold on there, missis!
The lad's with me!
- You know that short story?
- Yeah, he's adventure.
Honey, that's what they all say.
I heard that! I'll have you know I'm a classic!
Mm-hm. A classic... misprint.
Why, you old sea serpent! I'll rip out your pages and use them for... Oh, no!
Do something!
Hm.
Oops! I forgot. My wand doesn't always work outside the fantasy section.
You mean you can't wish us to the exit?
That overdue shrew's never even seen the exit.
More than you have, shorty!
In fact, the exit's just beyond my fantasy section. Hmph!
Then what are ye doing in these parts?
There a witches' convention around here, maybe?
Look, I was misshelved.
But that's over, now that young Prince
Charming here has come to check me out.
My good eye, he is.
The lad's checking me out!
Come on, boy, we're wasting time chumming off this dinghy.
It's on to the exit for us!
If he thinks the exit's in that direction, you know it's got to be in this one!
Don't listen to her, mate. She's not sailing with a full crew!
Ah-ah-ah!
Fantasy! She's a bloody nightmare.
Let's leave him. He doesn't even know where we are now!
Bilge water! Of course I know where we are! We're...
Hound of the Baskervilles.
We're in Baskervilles.
Have a look-see!
Hm. Huh?
Hey, this way! Through here!
Nice doggy! Good doggy!
Hurry!
Oh, baby.
Are we still in the library?
Aye, lad. The horror section.
It looks pretty scary.
That it does. Just stay close to me and... and you got nothing to worry about.
Mm-hm.
There it is! The exit!
Looks like the only way to reach the exit is through that there house.
No way I'm going in there.
It's your only chance, boy.
It's just a house.
Yeah, but 70 percent of all accidents are household-related.
Dr. Jekyll. Mr. Hyde.
Must be a duplex.
Whoa!
Go ahead, matey. I'm...
I'm right behind ye.
Well? Ring the bell.
Ohh!
- Good catch!
- Here, take it.
Isn't he sweet?
Oh, I scared you.
I'm sorry!
You mustn't judge a book by its cover.
Look, he's smiling!
That's a smile?
All right, teatime's over.
Let's start navigating this house.
Huh? No, wait! Don't go in there!
It's scary inside!
Ha! I ain't afeared of nothing!
I'm afraid.
Of what?
Or, of...
And... Aah!
And...
And...
Uh, I know how you feel.
Horror always has sad endings.
I come from a world of happy endings.
Why don't you come with us?
Yeah! And maybe you could help us through the house.
Through the house? Hm.
Uh.
You can do it.
'Kay.
Friend?
Oops!
Come on!
Hm?
He-hello?
A-anybody home?
What was that?
Nevermore!
Get me out of here!
May I assist you in some way?
Oh. Hello there, Mr...?
Doctor. Dr. Jekyll.
Well, sir, we did ring the bell.
It's all my fault. I was trying to help them find their way to the other side of the house.
The other side?
My boy, I derive no pleasure in telling you that you are in extreme danger.
- Danger?
- Even as we speak.
Lurking in this very room, waiting to strike, are forces of evil.
Wait for me! Wait for me!
Every man is possessed of both good... and evil.
Oh, yes.
But enough of that.
Anyone care for a drink?
Hm?
Ah.
I'll have a go with you, doc.
Ooh!
Stay back! This is a man's drink!
Can I have the olive?
Oh!
Uh-oh.
Now look what you've done!
Whoa!
Ooh!
No! No, no! Don't drink it!
Don't, don't!
Dr... Jekyll?
Dr. J?
My name is... Mr. Hyde!
Easy, there!
The stairs, mateys, the stairs!
Ahh!
Help, master! Don't leave me!
This is no way to treat a library book. Sanctuary!
Sanctuary!
Sanctuary!
Honey, you got to help him!
But I... I...
Oh!
At least this wand is good for something.
Come on!
Which way?
Down. Definitely down.
No, up. Definitely up! Up, up, up!
Come on!
What's going on?
Ghost stories.
Ha ha!
Get me outta here!
Aah!
Close the door!
Whoa!
Down there? I... I can't.
Come on, boy! Even books have spines.
Come, master!
I can do this. I can do this.
Aah!
Uhh! Uhh!
Reach deep within yourself, Richard.
Seize the courage.
Uhh! Uhh!
Whoa!
- Yay! You did it! You did it!
- Grand, boy!
Hooray, hooray, hooray.
Wow.
Do ya smell it?
Breathe it in, mateys.
Ha ha!
The land of adventure!
Look! There's the exit!
Hey! Wait for me!
Ha ha ha!
Home, sweet home!
There's only room for one up here.
From now on, it'll be smooth sailin'!
What are ya laughin' at?
Whoa!
Uhh!
A boat!
Is it... safe?
I wrote the book on sailin'. In fact, I am the book on sailin'.
I'm impressed.
We're sinking. We're going down!
Somebody do something!
Thank you.
Shove off, lads!
Jeez, the water looks kind of choppy.
Maybe we should've stayed back there where it was safe.
Whalin' men.
It's Cap'n Ahab, it is!
Another guy with a peg leg.
Mm-hm. Seems to be a fashion statement around here.
- Did you see it?
- See what?
The devil of the deep.
The white whale.
- Hm?
- Moby Dick!
Thar she blows!
I grin at thee, thou grinning whale!
He's possessed!
He's insane!
He's my kind of guy!
Look!
It's headed straight for them!
Thou damned whale!
Thus, I give up the spear!
So, you think I scared it?
He shouldn't swim right after eating, you know. He'll get cramps.
Where did he go?
Aah!
Row! Row for your lives!
Guys! Where are you?
Adventure? Boy, am I ever glad to see you.
Huh?
All right, all right!
Where's Horror?
And Fantasy?
Where are they?
I searched for 'em as much as I could, mate.
I'm afraid... I'm afraid they've gone below with Davy Jones.
No. It can't be.
You guys are the only friends I've ever had.
She's a cruel sea, lad.
They gotta be out there.
Horror!
Fantasy!
Sharks!
We may be joining them other two sooner than you think.
Hey, look!
Help, help! Over here!
Careful, mate. Not all sharks are in the water.
Get us out of here!
This way! Help!
It's a good thing you guys came along.
Ohh! We're missing two others about his size. Did you see 'em?
He's all the catch we've had today.
Huh?
I knew it! It's him!
Who?
The meanest, black-hearted pirate that ever sailed the seven seas.
Long John Silver!
Just set your keel down, mate.
John Silver's expecting live company.
Uhh!
Give the word, Cap'n Silver, sir, and
I'll show you the color of his insides.
Red! Red! They're red!
Stow your cutlass, Tom Morgan.
I want a better look at his outsides first.
Long John Silver!
Aye, lad, the very same.
Well, seeing as how me men plucked you out of the water like a drownin' field rat, you'll be joinin' our happy family as our new cabin boy.
Thanks, but I already have a family.
I really should be getting home now.
Oh, I think you are home.
Heh heh heh heh.
John Silver! Touch one hair on that boy's head, and you'll be answerin' to me!
Well, come aboard, matey! Ha ha.
Uhh!
You wouldn't happen to be going after me treasure, would you, now?
You ain't got any treasure worth goin' after!
- No treasure?
- No treasure?
He's lyin'! There's plenty of treasure for all of ya!
Search him!
The boy, too.
Hm.
Why, looky here.
Here he be, Cap'n.
What might this here be?
Money! It's yours! Keep it!
- Money, he says!
- Keep it, he says!
- Hm. Library card.
- Library card?
A cabin boy don't need no library card.
I'd like to get out of here!
Land ho!
Land ho!
There she be, mateys!
Treasure Island!
Stay on your toes, mate. When they go for the gold, we'll make our break.
Quit your squawkin'!
Look to the map. What's it say?
It's, uh, in the middle, by the waterfall.
No, it's east by some broccoli.
- Give me that!
- Broccoli.
You half-wits!
It's west, by a tree!
East, by broccoli!
They're all idiots.
What sort of way is that for bones to lie?
It ain't natural.
This island's haunted.
It's accursed, it is!
Oh, you're all yellow dogs.
Open your eyes. The bones is the compass pointin' the way to the doubloons.
It's gone!
Dig deeper, boys!
I say, dig deeper!
Find the treasure!
One gold piece. This is your treasure, is it?
Let's kill him and eat his parrot.
Stand by for trouble.
We mighta known you'd double-cross us.
Throw down your weapons, John Silver!
Why, you pack of back-bitin' dogs!
You'll be regrettin' this, George Merry.
Save your speeches.
Dead men don't bite.
16 men on a dead man's stomach...
No! No! Chest! Chest!
Chest! Chest!
Yo, ho, ho and a bottle of rum!
Evil spirits.
Sanctuary!
Ohh.
Horror! You're alive!
Not for long. Hee hee hee hee hee!
Aah!
Ohh!
Ohh-Ohh!
Ahchoo!
Fantasy!
Naturally. Well, who were you expecting, honey, the tooth fairy?
Get them!
Ha ha! At last, a good fight!
Aah!
Uhh!
Get me outta here!
Hey!
Why, you...
Uhh!
Get the boat, boy. We're gonna be shovin' off.
I'm not going with you.
The sword, honey. Get the sword.
Don't even think it, boy.
He ain't got the heart.
Hyah! Uhh!
Stay back!
Avast there, laddie.
Somebody could get hurt with that blade you got thar.
Be careful, master.
In the boat.
Huh? Easy now, matey.
Easy. I'm goin'.
Right ye are.
Into the boat, aye aye.
Ye be a hard lad, Richard Tyler.
Good sailin' to ya, shipmate.
15 men on a dead man's chest
Yo, ho, ho and a bottle of rum
- Way to go, honey.
- Yes!
Whew. Oh, I wish my dad coulda seen me.
Boy, I thought you two were goners.
We almost were, until this enchanting fellow discovered he could float.
It's hollow.
- Who's there?
- Adventure!
Adventure who?
What do you mean, Adventure who?
Open the blasted door, you dog-eared...
Aah!
Perfect timing.
I was just thanking these guys for saving us.
I coulda taken the lot of 'em with one hand tied behind me back!
That's just his way of saying thanks.
You're welcome!
Ahoy, matey!
Aye, we're lusty adventurous men.
Go away. You don't know what you're talkin' about.
L-I know I'm not your favorite kind of book, but I could be just like you.
You'll never be Adventure!
Ye ain't got the spine for it.
And take that stupid thing off!
Sorry.
Thinks he can be a pirate!
Seize the courage, Richard, then you will reach the exit.
I'll never get home.
You did good, honey.
I lost the library card.
I can't check anybody out.
We'll never get to the exit now.
Honey, never say "never" around Fantasy, because sometimes you've got to fight to make a wish come true.
So come on. Don't quit on me now.
Yeah.
Huh! That crazy hunchbook. Ahh.
You don't see me pretending to be Horror.
Why are you sittin' around like a bunch of 0l' wenches at teatime?
Pick one.
Mmm...
That one.
My library card!
I wrestled it away from three sharks who was eyein' it for breakfast.
At no small threat to me life, neither.
Mm-hm.
Where's Horror? Wasn't he with you?
He was, but he, uh... I mean,
I sort of, uh... He, uh...
What did you say to him now?
Well, I, uh... I, uh...
I just, uh, uh...
I'll go find him.
Yeah, you better go find him.
And be quick about it!
Horror!
Horror!
Horror!
Horror.
Hang on, mate! I'm coming!
You're lucky I was published with a thick hide!
Hm?
Come back, ya jellyfish!
Speak to me, mate.
Ye had a good heart and ye was braver than ye knew.
I... I'd walk the plank if I thought it would bring ye back.
That's beautiful.
Huh?
This is too cute.
Uhh!
Are you OK?
Thanks to my friend here.
Get off me!
Did you see that?
See what?
My wand! It's blinkin'!
That can only mean one thing.
The exit!
- The checkout!
- A happy ending.
Ohh!
Let's go! Come on!
Are you sure that swizzle stick of yours is workin' right?
Hm.
I don't know. Maybe we should test it.
You've gone overboard, missis!
Whatever you imagine
Is where your heart can go
There are worlds filled with treasure
Time without measure
To learn whatever you may need to know
Imagine
Imagine
You and I could fly...
- Look! Mother Goose!
- Hey, girl!
And leave all our doubts and fears behind...
Hello, my little baby. Hi!
You see, that's just what can happen
If you look inside your mind
There's no limit to the wonders
You can find
Whatever you imagine
Can make your life brand-new
There are miracles waiting
So keep concentrating
And I promise you that if you do
Whatever you imagine can come true
Wait for me!
Hey! Come here!
Those are my glasses!
Hey! Don't go up there!
What's the matter? Is
Adventure afraid to go in?
What? I live for moments like this.
Look! There it is! The exit!
Me sword! Uhh!
Earthquake!
Quick! Find page 1,001.
Arabian Nights?
That's it!
Ohh!
Get the boy!
Come on! The exit's up there!
We're gonna make it!
- Hooray! We're gonna make...
- Aah! My wand!
Oh, baby. I wish that hadn't happened.
Come on, guys! The exit!
This way, guys!
Aah!
We're almost there!
We made it!
Guys?
This dragon is history!
Don't try to stop me!
Be careful.
Huh? Hm.
You really are a classic.
Mmm!
How would you like to curl up with a good book?
Oh, me binding!
In your dreams!
Ooh!
Adventure, up here!
Go on, lad! Save yourself!
You think a bag of hot air is enough to stop me?
Dragon? He's more like a dragonfly, he is!
Look out!
Uhh.
Happy birthday.
Hang on, guys! I'm coming!
A sword.
Yes!
Ha ha! That's it, boy!
Go for the gizzard!
Bite him, bite him!
Aah!
Yah!
- Watch out for his tail!
- You've got him on the run!
Aah!
I'm not scared of you!
Aah!
Aah!
Huh?
Aah!
I gotta get out of here.
Aah!
Fantasy's wand!
This is not good.
Definitely not good at all.
Uh-oh.
Look to the books.
Look to the books.
Look to the books.
Look to the books!
Alice in Wonderland.
Off with his head!
Sheesh!
Mnh-mnh.
Mnh-mnh.
Jack and the Beanstalk.
Yeah! This is it!
I hate heights!
Aah!
Matey!
He's alive!
Aah!
Come on, guys!
Uhh!
Whew.
Are you all right?
Wh... wha...
Master, you saved us!
That ya did, matey.
Baby, you're the greatest.
Mm-wah!
Who's there?
The Pagemaster.
Hey! How'd you get here?
Quit it! We're in the presence of the Pagemaster.
I know who he is! He's the guy who did all this to me!
Do you have any idea what I've been through?
Tell me.
I was nearly torn apart by a crazy doctor.
I was made a slave by a bunch of mangy pirates, and eaten, got that, eaten by a fire-breathing dragon!
He don't mean it, my
Pagemaster. He don't mean it.
Not to mention being tossed, squashed and scared practically to death.
Yet you stand before me.
Well... yeah.
Think, boy! What kind of an adventure would you have had if I'd brought you here with the turn of a page?
You prevailed over evil.
Ah, you looked Moby
Dick in the eye, boy.
Ah, you had pirates tough, me lad, and don't no one speak any different.
If I had brought you here from the start, you never would have found the courage to face your own fears.
And in doing so, you triumph here and always.
Hey, is that... That's me!
That was you.
I'm ready to go home now.
I mean, we're ready.
The world awaits.
Whoa!
Godspeed to you, boy!
Wait for me!
Aah!
You took quite a spill, young man.
Huh?
Are you all right?
Careful! You'll slip again!
Hey, wait a minute! Wait a minute!
Wait! Uh, I forgot something.
Here.
I'm afraid you can only check out two.
Horror? But I promised him.
You promised whom?
- Look, I need... Just this once?
- Shh.
I have a talent for guessing what people need.
Just this once.
Shh.
Yes!
Good. That was definitely good.
I can't imagine where he could be.
Maybe we should call the police.
Alan!
He's home.
Alan.
It's impossible.
Rich?
We probably should put him in his bed.
Let's let him sleep up here tonight.
Love you, Richie.
Good night, son.
It's dark out here. I wish there was a night-light.
Honey, wish granted.
Ooh.
Hooray! Hooray!
Breathe it in, mateys.
This be the land of adventure.
You can lay to that.
Come here, handsome.
Why you cryin'?
Because I have friends.
That you do, matey.
Aye, that you do.
Ahem.
You know what would make this a happy ending?
A kiss.
OK.
I meant from her!
When this world
The real-life world
You're livin' in
Just gets too much
For you to take
When you find
Too many troubles on your mind
And feel just like
There's no escape
And it seems your heart's forgotten
How to believe
Turn a page in your soul
Mmm, there's a place you can go
Close your eyes and let your heart
Fly free
Fly free
Dream away, dream away
Let imagination light your way
Take you as far

Dream
Dream away, dream away
To a place where hope is shining
Find your silver lining

Believe, believe
Ohh, Ohh, ohh
Dream away, dream away
Let imagination light your way
Take you as far

Dream
Dream away, dream away
To a place where hope is shining
Find your silver lining
Everything you need
Everything is...
Just a dream away
All it takes is faith to make your dreams come true
Oh, oh
And somewhere in this world
There'll be somebody
To share your dreams
With you
Hey
Yeah, oh, yeah
Ohh
Oh, yeah, oh
Dream away, dream away
Let imagination light your way
Take you as far
As your heart can see
Dream
Dream away, dream away
To a place where hope is shining
Find your silver lining
Find your silver lining
Everything you need
Is just a dream
Just a dream
Away
Yeah
Whatever you imagine
Can one day come to be
There are dreams to awaken
Roads to be taken
Follow them and they will set you free
Whatever you imagine
ls where your heart can go
There are worlds filled with treasure
Time without measure
To learn whatever
You may need to know
Imagine
Imagine
You and I
Could fly past the sun
And leave all our doubts and fears
Behind us
You see, that's just what can happen
If you look inside your mind
There's no limit to the wonders
You can find
Whatever you imagine
Can make your life brand-new
There are miracles waiting
So keep concentrating
And I promise you that if you do
Whatever you imagine can come true
Whatever you imagine
Whatever you imagine
Whatever you imagine
- Can make your life brand-new
- Can make your life brand-new
There are miracles waiting
So keep concentrating
And I promise you that if you do
Whatever you imagine
Will come true

Life's not fair, is it?
You see, I... Well, I shall never be king.
And you shall never see the light of another day.
Adieu.
Didn't your mother ever tell you not to play with your food?
What do you want?
I'm here to announce that
King Mufasa's on his way, so you'd better have a good excuse for missing this morning's ceremony.
Oh, look, Zazu.
You've made me lose my lunch.
You'll lose more than that when the king gets through with you.
He's as mad as a hippo with a hernia.
I quiver with fear!
Now, Scar, don't look at me that way.
Help!
Scar?
Drop him.
Impeccable timing, Your Majesty.
Why, if it isn't my big brother descending from on high to mingle with the commoners.
Sarabi and I didn't see you at the presentation of Simba.
That was today?
I feel simply awful!
Must've slipped my mind.
Yes, well, as slippery as your mind is, as the king's brother, you should've been first in line!
Well, I was first in line, until the little hairball was born.
That hairball is my son and your future king.
I shall practise my curtsy!
Don't turn your back on me, Scar.
Oh, no, Mufasa.
Perhaps you shouldn't turn your back on me.
Is that a challenge?
Temper, temper.
I wouldn't dream of challenging you.
Pity. Why not?
Well, as far as brains go,
I got the lion's share.
But when it comes to brute strength,
I'm afraid I'm at the shallow end of the gene pool.
There's one in every family, sire.
Two in mine, actually, and they always manage to ruin special occasions.
What am I going to do with him?
He'd make a very handsome throw rug.
Zazu!
And just think, whenever he gets dirty, you could take him out and beat him.
Simba.
Dad! Dad!
Come on, dad, we gotta go! Wake up!
Sorry.
Dad! Dad!
Your son is awake.
Before sunrise, he's your son.
Dad! Come on, Dad.
You promised.
Okay, Okay. I'm up, I'm up.
Yeah!
Look, Simba.
Everything the light touches is our kingdom.
A king's time as ruler rises and falls like the sun.
One day, Simba, the sun will set on my time here and will rise with you as the new king.
- And this'll all be mine?
- Everything.
Everything the light touches.
What about that shadowy place?
That's beyond our borders.
You must never go there, Simba.
But I thought a king can do whatever he wants.
Oh, there's more to being king than getting your way all the time.
- There's more?
- Simba...
Everything you see exists together in a delicate balance.
As king, you need to understand that balance and respect all the creatures, from the crawling ant to the leaping antelope.
But, Dad, don't we eat the antelope?
Yes, Simba, but let me explain.
When we die, our bodies become the grass, and the antelope eat the grass.
And so we are all connected in the great circle of life.
- Good morning, sire!
- Good morning, Zazu.
Checking in with the morning report.
Fire away.
Well! The buzz from the bees is that the leopards are in a bit of a spot.
Really?
What are you doing, son?
Pouncing.
Let an old pro show you how it's done.
I told the elephants to forget it, but they can't...
- Zazu, would you turn around?
- Yes, sire.
The cheetahs are hard up, but...
Stay low to the ground.
Cheetahs never prosper...
Yeah, okay.
Stay low to the ground, right? Yeah.
- What going on?
- A pouncing lesson.
Very good. Pouncing.
Pouncing?
No, sire, you can't be serious...
This is so humiliating.
Try not to make a sound.
What are you telling him, Mufasa?
Mufasa? Simba?
That's very good.
- Zazu!
- Yes!
- News from the underground.
- Now, this time...
Sire! Hyenas in the Pride Lands!
Zazu, take Simba home.
Aw, dad, can't I come?
No, son.
Pah! I never get to go anywhere.
Oh, young master, one day, you will be king.
Then you can chase those slobbering, mangy, stupid poachers from dawn until dusk.
Hey, Uncle Scar! Guess what?
I despise guessing games.
I'm gonna be King of Pride Rock.
Oh, goody!
My dad just showed me the whole kingdom, and I'm gonna rule it all!
Yes. Well, forgive me for not leaping forjoy.
Bad back, you know.
Hey, Uncle Scar.
When I'm king, what'll that make you?
A monkey's uncle.
- You're so weird.
- You have no idea.
So, your father showed you the whole kingdom, did he?
Everything.
He didn't show you what's beyond that rise at the northern border?
Well, no. He said I can't go there.
And he's absolutely right.
It's far too dangerous.
Only the bravest lions go there.
Well, I'm brave. What's out there?
I'm sorry, Simba, I just can't tell you.
Why not?
I'm only looking out for the well-being of my favourite nephew.
Yeah, right! I'm your only nephew.
All the more reason for me to be protective.
An elephant graveyard is no place for a young prince. Oops!
An elephant what?
Oh, dear, I've said too much.
Well, I suppose you'd have found out sooner or later, you being so clever and all.
Just do me one favour.
Promise me you'll never visit that dreadful place.
No problem.
There's a good lad.
You run along now and have fun.
And remember, it's our little secret.
- Hey, Nala.
- Hi, Simba.
Come on. I just heard about this great place.
Simba! I'm kind of in the middle of a bath.
And it's time for yours.
Mom!
Mom, you're messing up my mane!
Okay, okay, I'm clean.
Can we go now?
So, where are we going?
It better not be anyplace dumb.
No, it's really cool.
So, where is this really cool place?
Oh.
- Around the water hole.
- The water hole?
What's so great about the water hole?
I'll show you when we get there.
Oh.
Mom, can I go with Simba?
What do you think, Sarabi?
Well...
Please?
It's all right with me.
- Yeah!
- All right!
As long as Zazu goes with you.
No, not Zazu.
Step lively.
The sooner we get to the water hole, the sooner we can leave.
So, where are we really going?
An elephant graveyard.
Zazu.
Right. So, how are we gonna ditch the dodo?
Oh, just look at you two.
Little seeds of romance blossoming in the savanna.
Your parents will be thrilled, what with your being betrothed and all.
Be-what?
Betrothed. Intended.
Affianced.
Meaning...
One day, you two are going to be married.
- Yuck!
- Eww!
I can't marry her. She's my friend.
Yeah, it'd be so weird.
Sorry to bust your bubble, but you two turtle doves have no choice.
It's a tradition going back generations.
When I'm king, that'll be the first thing to go.
- Not so long as I'm around.
- Well, in that case, you're fired.
Nice try, but only the king can do that.
Well, he's the future king.
Yeah, so you have to do what I tell you.
Not yet, I don't.
And with an attitude like that,
I'm afraid you're shaping up to be a pretty pathetic king, indeed.
Not the way I see it.

I beg your pardon, madam, but get off!
Simba?
Nala!
All right! It worked!
- We lost him.
- I am a genius.
Hey, genius, it was my idea.
Yeah, but I pulled it off.
- With me!
- Oh, yeah?
- Pinned ya.
- Hey, let me up!
Pinned ya again.
This is it. We made it.
It's really creepy.
Yeah.
Isn't it great?
- We could get in big trouble.
- I know!
I wonder if its brains are still in there.
There's only one way to know.
Come on, let's go check it out.
Wrong! The only checking out you will do will be to check out of here.
Oh, man!
We're way beyond the boundary of the Pride Lands.
Look, banana beak is scared.
It's Mr banana beak to you, fuzzy, and right now we are all in very real danger.
Danger?
I walk on the wild side.
I laugh in the face of danger.
Well, well, well, Banzai, what have we got here?
I don't know, Shenzi.
What do you think, Ed?
Just what I was thinking.
A trio of trespassers!
And quite by accident, let me assure you.
A simple navigational error.
Wait, wait, wait.
I know you.
You're Mufasa's little stooge.
I, madam, am the king's major-domo.
And that would make you...
The future king.
Do you know what we do to kings who step out of their kingdom?
You can't do anything to me.
Technically, they can.
We are on their land.
But you told me they're nothing but slobbering, mangy, stupid poachers.
Ix-nay on the upid-stay.
- Who are you callin' upid-stay?
- My, my, my. Oh, look at the sun!
- It's time to go!
- What's the hurry?
We'd love you to stick around for dinner.
Yeah, we could have whatever's lion around!
Wait, wait, wait, I got one, I got one!
Make mine a cub sandwich!
Whaddaya think?
What, Ed? What is it?
Hey, did we order this dinner to go?
No, why?
'Cause there it goes!
- Did we lose 'em?
- I think so.
Where's Zazu?
The little major-domo bird hippety-hopped all the way to the birdie-boiler.
Oh, no! Not the birdie-boiler!
Aaaah!
Hey, why don't you pick on somebody your own size?
- Like you?
- Oops.
Boo!
Simba!
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
That was it?
Do it again. Come on.
- Oh, please, please! Uncle, uncle!
- Silence!
- We're gonna shut up right now!
- Calm down. We're really sorry.
If you ever come near my son again...
Oh, this is... This is your son?
- Oh, your son.
- Did you know that?
No. Me? I didn't know... No, did you?
- No, of course not.
- No.
Ed?
Toodles.
- Dad, I...
- You deliberately disobeyed me.
- Dad, I'm... I'm sorry.
- Let's go home.
I thought you were very brave.
Zazu.
Yes, sire?
Take Nala home.
I've got to teach my son a lesson.
Come, Nala.
Simba, good luck.
Simba!
Simba, I'm very disappointed in you.
- I know.
- You could've been killed.
You deliberately disobeyed me, and what's worse, you put Nala in danger.
I was just trying to be brave, like you.
I'm only brave when I have to be.
Simba, being brave doesn't mean you go looking for trouble.
But you're not scared of anything.
I was today.
- You were?
- Yes.
I thought I might lose you.
I guess even kings get scared?
- But you know what?
- What?
I think those hyenas were even scareder.
'Cause nobody messes with your dad.
- Come here, you.
- Oh, no! No!
Come here!
Gotcha!
Dad?
- We're pals, right?
- Right.
And we'll always be together, right?
Simba, let me tell you something that my father told me.
Look at the stars.
The great kings of the past look down on us from those stars.
- Really?
- Yes.
So whenever you feel alone, just remember that those kings will always be there to guide you.
And so will I.
Man, that lousy Mufasa.
I won't be able to sit for a week.
It's not funny, Ed.
Hey, shut up!
Will you knock it off?
- Well, he started it.
- Look at you guys.
No wonder we're dangling at the bottom of the food chain.
Man, I hate dangling.
Yeah? If it weren't for those lions, we'd be runnin' the joint.
Man, I hate lions.
- So pushy.
- And hairy.
- And stinky.
- And, man, are they...
Ugly!
Oh, surely we lions are not all that bad.
- Oh.
- Oh, Scar. It's just you.
We were afraid it was somebody important.
Yeah, you know, like Mufasa.
- Yeah.
- I see.
- Now that's power!
- Tell me about it.
I just hear that name and I shudder.
- Mufasa!
- Do it again.
- Mufasa!
- Ooooh!
Mufasa! Mufasa! Mufasa!
It tingles me.
I'm surrounded by idiots.
Now, you, Scar, I mean, you're one of us. I mean, you're our pal.
Charmed.
Oh, I like that. He's not king, but he's still so proper.
Yeah. Hey, did you bring us anything to eat,
Scar, old buddy, old pal?
Did ya, did ya, did ya?
I don't think you really deserve this.
I practically gift-wrapped those cubs for you, and you couldn't even dispose of them.
Well, you know, it wasn't exactly like they was alone, Scar.
Yeah. What were we supposed to do?
Kill Mufasa?
Precisely.

You wait here. Your father has a marvellous surprise for you.
What is it?
If I told you, it wouldn't be a surprise now, would it?
If you tell me,
I'll still act surprised.
Ho ho ho! You are such a naughty boy.
- Come on, Uncle Scar.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
This is just for you and your daddy.
You know, a sort of father-son thing.
Well, I'd better go get him.
- I'll go with you.
- No.
No. Just stay on this rock.
You wouldn't want to end up in another mess like you did with the hyenas.
- You know about that?
- Simba, everybody knows about that.
- Really?
- Oh, yes.
Lucky daddy was there to save you, eh?
Oh, and just between us, you might want to work on that little roar of yours?
Oh. Okay.
Hey, Uncle Scar, will I like this surprise?
Simba, it's to die for.
Shut up.
I can't help it. I'm so hungry.
I got to have a wildebeest.
Stay put.
Can't I just pick off one of the little sick ones?
No. We wait for the signal from Scar.
There he is. Let's go.
"Little roar." Puh!
Rarr!
Rrrarr!
Rarr!
Oh, look, sire, the herd is on the move.
- Odd.
- Mufasa, quick.
Stampede in the gorge.
- Simba's down there!
- Simba?
Zazu, help me!
Your father is on the way! Hold on!
Hurry!
There! There on that tree!
Hold on, Simba!
Dad!
Oh, Scar, this is awful!
What'll we do? What'll we do?
I'll go back for help, that's what I'll do.
Dad!
Scar!
- Brother.
- Brother, help me!
Long live the king.
No!
Dad!
Dad?
Dad, come on.
You got to get up.
Dad?
We got to go home.
Help!
Somebody!
Anybody.
Help.
Simba. What have you done?
There were wildebeests, and he tried to save me.
It was an accident.
I didn't mean for it to happen.
Of course. Of course you didn't.
No one ever means for these things to happen.
But the king is dead.
And if it weren't for you, he'd still be alive.
Oh, what will your mother think?
What am I going to do?
Run away, Simba.
Run. Run away and never return.
Kill him.
Hey, there he goes. There he goes.
So go get him.
There ain't no way I'm going in there.
What, you want me to come out looking like you, cactus butt?
But we got to finish the job.
Well, he's as good as dead out there anyway.
And if he comes back, we'll kill him.
Yeah! You hear that?
If you ever come back, we'll kill you!
Mufasa's death is a terrible tragedy.
But to lose Simba, who had barely begun to live...
For me, it is a deep, personal loss.
So it is with a heavy heart that I assume the throne.
Yet out of the ashes of this tragedy we shall rise to greet the dawning of a new era in which lion and hyena come together in a great and glorious future.
Yaaaah!
Get out! Get out! Get out of here!
I love this! Bowling for buzzards.
Hee hee hee! Gets 'em every time.
Hey, Timon, you better come look.
I think it's still alive.
Eeeuw.
All righty, what have we got here?
Jeez, it's a lion! Run, Pumbaa, move it!
Hey, Timon, it's just a little lion.
Look at him. He's so cute and all alone.
- Can we keep him?
- Pumbaa, are you nuts?
You're talking about a lion.
Lions eat guys like us.
- But he's so little.
- He's going to get bigger.
Maybe he'll be on our side.
That's the stupidest thing
I ever heard. Maybe he'll...
Hey, I've got it.
What if he's on our side?
You know, having a lion around might not be such a bad idea.
So we're keeping him?
Of course.
Who's the brains of this outfit?
My point exactly.
Jeez, I'm fried. Let's get out of here and find some shade.
- You okay, kid?
- I guess so.
You nearly died.
I saved you.
Well, Pumbaa helped. A little.
Thanks for your help.
Hey, where you going?
Nowhere.
Gee, he looks blue.
- I'd say brownish gold.
- No, no, no. I mean he's depressed.
Kid, what's eating you?
Nothing.
He's at the top of the food chain.
The food chain!
So, where you from?
Who cares? I can't go back.
You're an outcast.
That's great. So are we.
- What'd you do, kid?
- Something terrible.
- But I don't want to talk about it.
- We don't want to hear about it.
Come on, Timon. Anything we can do?
Not unless you can change the past.
You know, kid, in times like this, my buddy Timon here says,
"You got to put your behind in your past."
No, no, no.
- I mean...
- Amateur.
Lie down before you hurt yourself.
It's,
"You got to put your past behind you."
Look, kid, bad things happen, and you can't do anything about it, right?
- Right.
- Wrong!
When the world turns its back on you, you turn your back on the world.
Well, that's not what I was taught.
Then maybe you need a new lesson.
Repeat after me.

I would never have had to do this with Mufasa.
What? What did you say?
- Nothing.
- You know the law.
Never, ever mention that name in my presence. I am the king!
Yes, sire, you are the king.
I... I only mentioned it to illustrate the differences in your royal managerial approaches.
- Hey, boss.
- Oh, what is it this time?
- We got a bone to pick with you.
- I'll handle this.
Scar, there's no food, no water.
Yeah. It's dinner time and we ain't got no stinking entrées.
It's the lionesses' job to do the hunting.
- Yeah, but they won't go hunt.
- Oh...
- Eat Zazu.
- Oh, you wouldn't want me.
I'd be so tough and gamey and...
Oh, Zazu, don't be ridiculous.
All you need is a little garlic.
I thought things were bad under Mufasa.
- What did you say?
- I said Muf...
I said... qué pasa?
Good. Now get out.
But we're still hungry.
Out!
- Nice one, Simba.
- Thanks.
- Man, I'm stuffed.
- Me, too.
I ate like a pig.
Pumbaa, you are a pig.
Oh. Right.
- Timon?
- Yeah?
Ever wonder what those sparkling dots are up there?
Pumbaa, I don't wonder, I know.
Oh? What are they?
They're fireflies.
Fireflies that got stuck up in that big bluish-black thing.
Oh, gee.
I always thought they were balls of gas burning billions of miles away.
Pumbaa, with you, everything's gas.
Simba, what do you think?
Well, I don't know.
Oh, come on. Give, give, give, give.
Come on. We told you ours. Please?
Well...
Somebody once told me that the great kings of the past are up there watching over us.
Really?
You mean a bunch of royal dead guys are watching us?
Pfff!
- Who told you something like that?
- Yeah, yeah.
- What mook made that up?
- Yeah. Pretty dumb?
- Aw, you're killing me.
- Yeah.
Was it something I said?
Simba?
He's... He's alive? He's alive!
It is time.

And your mother, what will she think?
She doesn't have to know.
Nobody has to know.
Of course they do.
Everyone thinks you're dead.
They do?
Yeah. Scar told us about the stampede.
He did? What else did he tell you?
What else matters? You're alive.
And that means, you're the king.
King? Lady, have you got your lions crossed!
King?
Your Majesty, I gravel at your feet.
Mwah! Mwah! Mwah!
- Stop it.
- It's not gravel, it's grovel.
And don't! He's not the king. Are you?
- No.
- Simba!
No, I'm not the king.
Maybe I was gonna be, but that was a long time ago.
Let me get this straight.
You're the king? And never told us?
- Look, I'm still the same guy.
- But with power.
Could you guys excuse us for a few minutes?
Hey, whatever she has to say, she can say in front of us, right, Simba?
Maybe you'd better go.
It starts. You think you know a guy.
Timon and Pumbaa, you learn to love 'em.

It's like you're back from the dead.

But I don't understand something.
You've been alive all this time.
Why didn't you come back to Pride Rock?
Well, I just needed to get out on my own, live my own life.
And I did, and it's great.
We've really needed you at home.
- No one needs me.
- Yes, we do. You're the king.
Nala, we've been through this.
I'm not the king. Scar is.
Simba, he let the hyenas take over the Pride Lands.
- What?
- Everything's destroyed.
There's no food, no water.
Simba, if you don't do something soon, everyone will starve.
- I can't go back.
- Why?
- You wouldn't understand.
- What?
No, no, no. It doesn't matter.
Hakuna matata.
- What?
- Hakuna matata.
It's something I learned out here.
Sometimes bad things happen...
Simba... and there's nothing you can do about it. So why worry?
- Because it's your responsibility.
- Well, what about you? You left.
I left to find help, and I found you.
Don't you understand?
You're our only hope.
- Sorry.
- What's happened to you?
- You're not the Simba I remember.
- You're right. I'm not.
- Now are you satisfied?
- No. Just disappointed.
You know, you're starting to sound like my father.
Good. At least one of us does.
You think you can just show up and tell me how to live my life?
You don't even know what I've been through.
I would if you'd just tell me.
- Forget it!
- Fine!
She's wrong. I can't go back.
What would it prove, anyway?
It won't change anything.
You can't change the past.
You said you'd always be there for me!
But you're not.
And it's because of me.
It's my fault.

Can't cut it out.

Simba, you have forgotten me.
No. How could I?
You have forgotten who you are, and so have forgotten me.
Look inside yourself, Simba.
You are more than what you have become.
You must take your place in the circle of life.
How can I go back?
I'm not who I used to be.
Remember who you are.

No! Please, don't leave me!

Looks like the winds are changing.
Change is good.
Yeah, but it's not easy.
I know what I have to do, but going back means I'll have to face my past.
I've been running from it for so long.
Jeez! What was that for?
It doesn't matter. It's in the past.
Yeah, but it still hurts.
Oh, yes, the past can hurt.
But the way I see it you can either run from it or learn from it.

He was, but now I can't find him.

Ho ho! You won't find him here!

I can't believe it. He's gone back!
Gone back? What do you mean?
Hey, what's goin' on here?
- Who's the monkey?
- Simba went back to challenge Scar.
- Who?
- Scar.
- Who's got a scar?
- No, it's his uncle.
- The monkey's his uncle?
- No!
Simba's gone back to challenge his uncle to take his place as king.
Oh.
Simba, wait up!
- It's awful, isn't it?
- I didn't want to believe you.
What made you come back?
I finally got some sense knocked into me, and I've got the bump to prove it.
Besides, this is my kingdom.

Scar, there is no food.
The herds have moved on.
No, you're just not looking hard enough.
It's over. There is nothing left.
We have only one choice.
We must leave Pride Rock.
- We're not going anywhere.
- You have sentenced us to death.
- Then so be it.
- You can't do that.
I am the king. I can do whatever I want.
If you were half the king Mufasa was...
I'm ten times the king Mufasa was!
Mufasa? No, you're dead.
Mufasa?
No. It's me.
Simba! You're alive? How can that be?
It doesn't matter. I'm home.
Simba?
Simba! Oh, I'm a little surprised to see you alive.
Give me one good reason why I shouldn't rip you apart.
Oh, Simba, you must understand.
The pressures of ruling a kingdom...
Are no longer yours. Step down, Scar.
Oh, well, I would, naturally.
However, there is one little problem.
You see them?
They think I'm king.
Well, we don't.
Simba's the rightful king.
The choice is yours, Scar.
Either step down or fight.
Oh, must this all end in violence?
I'd hate to be responsible for the death of a family member.
- Wouldn't you agree, Simba?
- That's not gonna work, Scar.
I've put it behind me.
But what about your faithful subjects?
Have they put it behind them?
Simba, what is he talking about?
So you haven't told them your little secret.
Well, Simba, now's your chance to tell them.
Tell them who is responsible for Mufasa's death.
I am.
It's not true.
Tell me it's not true.
- It's true.
- You see? He admits it!
- Murderer!
- No! It was an accident.
If it weren't for you, Mufasa would be alive. It's your fault he's dead!
- Do you deny it?
- No.
- Then you're guilty.
- No, I'm not a murderer!
Oh, Simba, you're in trouble again, but this time daddy isn't here to save you, and now everyone knows why!
Simba!
Now, this looks familiar.
Where have I seen this before?
Let me think.
Oh, yes. I remember.
This is just the way your father looked before he died.
And here's my little secret.
I killed Mufasa.
No! Murderer!
- No, Simba, please.
- Tell them the truth.
Truth? But truth is in the eye of the behold...
All right.
All right.
I did it.
So they can hear you.
I killed Mufasa!
Hee-yah!
Excuse me. Pardon me.
Comin' through. Hot stuff.
Aagghh!
- Let me out! Let me out!
- Let me in! Let me in!
Please, don't eat me.
Drop 'em!
- Hey, who's the pig?
- Are you talkin' to me?
- He called him a pig.
- To me?
- Shouldn't have done that.
- To me?
- Now they're in for it.
- They call me Mr Pig!
Aaaaggghhh!
Take that, you stupid...
Take that and that!
Run, you yellow-belly!
- Murderer.
- Simba. Simba, please.
- Please, have mercy. I beg you.
- You don't deserve to live.
But Simba, I am family.
It's the hyenas who are the real enemy.
It was their fault. It was their idea.
Why should I believe you?
Everything you ever told me was a lie.
What are you going to do?
You wouldn't kill your own uncle.
No, Scar.
I'm not like you.
Oh, Simba, thank you.
You are truly noble.
I'll make it up to you, I promise.
And how can I prove myself to you?
Tell me. I mean, anything.
Run.
Run away, Scar, and never return.
Yes.
Of course.
As you wish, your Majesty!
My friends!
Friends? I thought he said we were the enemy.
Yeah. That's what I heard.
Ed?
No. Let me explain.
No, you don't understand!
No, I didn't mean... No! No!
It is time.
Remember.

Oh, I come from a land
From a faraway place
Where the caravan camels roam
Where it's flat and immense
And the heat is intense
It's barbaric, but hey, it's home
When the wind's from the east
And the sun's from the west
And the sand in the glass is right
Come on down, stop on by
Hop a carpet and fly
To another Arabian night
Arabian nights
Like Arabian days
More often than not
Are hotter than hot
In a lot of good ways
Arabian nights
'Neath Arabian moons
A fool off his guard
Could fall and fall hard
Out there on the dunes
Ah, salaam and good evening to you, worthy friend.
Please, please, come closer.
Too close. A little too close.
There.
Welcome to Agrabah, city of mystery, of enchantment, and the finest merchandise this side of the River Jordan, on sale today. Come on down.
Look at this. Yes.
Combination hookah and coffeemaker.
Also makes julienne fries.
Will not break. Will not...
It broke.
Ohh! Look at this.
I have never seen one of these intact before.
This is the famous
Dead Sea Tupperware.
Listen. Ah, still good.
Wait. Don't go.
I can see that you're only interested in the exceptionally rare.
I think, then, you would be most rewarded to consider this.
Do not be fooled by its commonplace appearance.
Like so many things, it is not what is outside, but what is inside that counts.
This is no ordinary lamp.
It once changed the course of a young man's life.
A young man who, like this lamp, was more than what he seemed.
A diamond in the rough.
Perhaps you would like to hear the tale?
It begins on a dark night,
where a dark man waits
with a dark purpose.
You are late.
A thousand apologies,
O patient one.
You have it, then?
I had to slit a few throats, but I got it.
Ah-ah-ahhh.
The treasure.
Ow!
Trust me, my pungent friend.
- You'll get what's coming to you.
- What's coming to you. Awk!
Quickly! Follow the trail.
Faster.
At last, after all my years of searching, the Cave of Wonders.
Awk. Cave of Wonders.
By Allah.
Now, remember. Bring me the lamp.
The rest of the treasure is yours, but the lamp is mine.
Awk, the lamp. Awk, the lamp.
Jeez, where'd you dig this bozo up?
Shh.
Who disturbs my slumber?
It is I, Gazeem, a humble thief.
Know this.
Only one may enter here, one whose worth lies far within.
A diamond in the rough.
What are you waiting for? Go on.
No!
Seek thee out the diamond in the rough.
I can't believe it.
I just don't believe it.
We're never gonna get a hold of that stupid lamp.
Just forget it. Look at this. I'm so ticked off that I'm moulting.
Patience, Iago. Patience.
Gazeem was obviously less than worthy.
Oh, there's a big surprise.
I think I'm gonna have a heart attack and die from that surprise.
What are we gonna do? We got a big problem here, a big...
Yes.
Only one may enter.
I must find this one, this...
Diamond in the rough.
Stop! Thief!
I'll have your hands for a trophy, street rat.
All this for a loaf of bread?
Whoa!
- There he is!
- You won't get away so easy!
You think that was easy?
You two, over that way, and you, follow me.
- We'll find him.
- Morning, ladies.
Getting into trouble a little early today, aren't we, Aladdin?
Trouble? No way. You're only in trouble if you get caught.
- Gotcha.
- I'm in trouble.
And this time...
Perfect timing, Abu, as usual.
- Abu.
- Come on. Let's get outta here.
Gotta keep one jump
Ahead of the bread line
One swing ahead of the sword
I steal only what I can't afford
That's everything
One jump ahead of the lawmen
That's all, and that's no joke
These guys don't appreciate I'm broke
- Riffraff
Street rat
Scoundrel
Take that
Just a little snack, guys
Rip him open
Take it back, guys
I can take a hint
Gotta face the facts
- You're my only friend, Abu
Who?
Oh, it's sad Aladdin's hit the bottom
He's become a one-man rise in crime
I'd blame parents
Except he hasn't got 'em
Gotta eat to live
Gotta steal to eat
Tell you all about it
When I got the time
One jump ahead of the slowpokes
One skip ahead of my doom
Next time gonna use a nom de plume
There he is
One jump ahead of the hit men
One hit ahead of the flock
I think I'll take a stroll
Around the block
- Stop, thief
- Vandal
- Abu
- Scandal
Let's not be too hasty
Still I think he's rather tasty
Gotta eat to live
Gotta steal to eat
Otherwise we'd get along
Wrong
Get him!
He's got a sword!
You idiots. We've all got swords.
- One jump ahead of the hoof beats
- Vandal!
- One hop ahead of the hump
- Street rat!
- One trick ahead of disaster
- Scoundrel!
They're quick, but I'm much faster
Here goes, better throw my hand in
Wish me happy landin'
All I gotta do is jump
Yuck! Oy!
And now, esteemed effendi, we feast. All right.
Yum, yum!
Uh-oh.
Here. Go on. Take it.
Ah, don't. Huh?
On his way to the palace, I suppose.
Another suitor for the princess.
Out of my way, you filthy brats.
Hey!
If I were as rich as you,
I could afford some manners.
Oh. I'll teach you some manners.
Look at that, Abu.
It's not every day you see a horse with two rear ends.
Ooh!
You are a worthless street rat.
You were born a street rat, you'll die a street rat, and only your fleas will mourn you.
I'm not worthless.
And I don't have fleas.
Come on, Abu. Let's go home.
Riffraff, street rat
I don't buy that
If only they'd look closer
Would they see a poor boy?
No, siree
They'd find out
There's so much more
To me
Someday, Abu, things are gonna change.
We'll be rich, live in a palace, and never have any problems at all.
I've never been so insulted.
Oh, Prince Achmed. You're not leaving so soon, are you?
Good luck marrying her off.
Oh! Jasmine.
Jasmine!
Jasmine!
Confound it, Rajah.
So, this is why Prince
Achmed stormed out.
Oh, Father.
Rajah was just playing with him. Weren't you, Rajah?
You were just playing with that overdressed, self-absorbed Prince
Achmed, weren't you?
Dearest, you've got to stop rejecting every suitor who comes to call.
The law says you must be married to a prince by your next birthday.
The law is wrong.
You've only got three more days.
Father, I hate being forced into this.
If I do marry, I want it to be for love.
Jasmine, it's not only this law.
I'm not going to be around forever, and, well, I...
I just want to make sure you're taken care of.
Provided for.
Please try to understand.
I've never done a thing on my own.
I've never had any real friends.
Except you, Rajah.
I've never even been outside the palace walls.
But, Jasmine, you're a princess.
Then maybe I don't want to be a princess any more.
Oooh! I... I...
Allah forbid you should have any daughters.
Hmm?
I don't know where she gets it from.
Her mother wasn't nearly so picky.
Oh! Ah, Jafar.
My most trusted advisor.
I am in desperate need of your wisdom.
My life is but to serve you, my lord.
It's this suitor business. Jasmine refuses to choose a husband.
- I'm at my wit's end.
- Awk! Wit's end!
Oh!
Have a cracker, pretty Polly.
Your Majesty certainly has a way with dumb animals.
Now, then, perhaps I can divine a solution to this thorny problem.
If anyone can help, it's you.
But it would require the use of the mystic blue diamond.
Oh. Uh, my ring?
But it's been in the family for years.
It is necessary to find the princess a suitor.
Don't worry.
Everything will be fine.
The diamond.
Here, Jafar.
Whatever you need will be fine.
You are most gracious, my liege.
Now, run along and play with your little toys, hmm?
Yes. That will be pretty good.
I can't take it any more!
If I gotta choke down on one more of those mouldy, disgusting crackers...
Bam! Whack!
Calm yourself, Iago.
Then I'd grab him around the head. Whack!
Soon I will be sultan, not that addlepated twit.
And then I stuff the crackers down his throat. Ha, ha!
Oh, I'm sorry, Rajah.
But I can't stay here and have my life lived for me.
I'll miss you.
Good bye.
Okay, Abu. Go.
Try this. Your taste buds will dance and sing.
Get your paws off that.
Why, you...
Get away from here, you cursed, filthy ape!
Good bye.
Nice going, Abu.
Breakfast is served.
Pretty lady, buy a pot. No finer pot in brass or silver.
Sugar dates. Sugar dates and figs.
Sugar dates and pistachios.
Would the lady like a necklace?
A pretty necklace for a pretty lady.
Fresh fish!
We catch 'em, you buy 'em!
Oh, no. I don't think so.
Oh!
Excuse me.
I'm really very sorry.
Wow.
Uh-oh.
Hello? Hello?
Oh, you must be hungry.
Here you go.
You'd better be able to pay for that.
- Pay?
- No one steals from my cart.
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
I don't have any money.
- Thief!
- Please...
If you let me go to the palace,
I can get some from the sultan.
Do you know what the penalty is for stealing?
No! No, please!
Thank you, kind sir. I'm so glad you found her.
I've been looking all over for you.
- What are you doing?
- Just play along.
You, uh, know this girl?
Sadly, yes. She is my sister.
She's a little crazy.
She said she knew the sultan.
She thinks the monkey is the sultan.
O wise Sultan, how may I serve you?
Tragic, isn't it?
But no harm done.
Now, come along, sis.
Time to go see the doctor.
Oh, hello, Doctor. How are you?
No, no, no. Not that one.
Come on, Sultan.
Huh? What?
Come back here, you little thieves!
With all due respect,
Your Rottenness, couldn't we just wait for a real storm?
Save your breath, Iago. Faster.
Yes, O mighty evil one.
Part, sands of time.
Reveal to me the one who can enter the cave.
Yes! Yes!
There he is.
My diamond in the rough.
That's him? That's the clown we've been waitin' for?
Let's have the guards extend him an invitation to the palace, shall we?
Swell.
Almost there.
I want to thank you for stopping that man.
Uh, forget it.
So, this is your first time in the marketplace, huh?
Is it that obvious?
Well, you do kind of stand out.
I mean, uh, you don't seem to know how dangerous Agrabah can be.
Hmm. I'm a fast learner.
Wow.
Hey.
Come on. This way.
Whoa. Watch your head there.
Be careful.
Is this where you live?
Yep. Just me and Abu.
Come and go as we please.
That sounds fabulous.
Well, it's not much, but it's got a great view.
Wow. The palace looks pretty amazing, huh?
Oh, it's wonderful.
I wonder what it would be like to live there, and have servants and valets.
Oh, sure. People who tell you where to go and how to dress.
It's better than here.
You're always scraping for food and ducking the guards.
You're not free to make your own choices.
- Sometimes you feel so...
- You're just...
- Trapped.
- Trapped.
So, where are you from?
What does it matter?
I ran away and I am not going back.
- Really? How come?
- Why, you...
My father's forcing me to get married.
That's... That's awful.
Abu!
What?
Abu says, uh, that's not fair.
What?
- Oh, did he?
- Yeah, of course.
And does Abu have anything else to say?
Well, uh, he wishes there was something he could do to help.
Oh, boy.
Hmm.
Tell him that's very sweet.
Here you are.
- They're after me!
- They're after you?
My father must have sent them...
- Do you trust me?
- What?
- Do you trust me?
- Yes...
Then jump!
We just keep running into each other, don't we, street rat?
Run! Go! Get out of here!
Get this thing off of me!
- It's the dungeon for you, boy.
- Get off of me.
Let him go.
Looky here, men. A street mouse.
Unhand him, by order of the princess.
Princess Jasmine.
- The princess?
- Princess?
What are you doing outside the palace? And with this street rat.
That's not your concern. Do as
I command. Release him.
I would, Princess, except my orders come from Jafar.
- You'll have to take it up with him.
- Believe me, I will.
Jafar?
Oh, Princess.
Awk! Jafar, I'm stuck.
How may I be of service to you?
The guards just took a boy from the market, on your orders.
Your father has charged me with keeping peace in Agrabah.
- The boy was a criminal.
- What was his crime?
I can't breathe, Jafar.
Why, kidnapping the princess, of course.
If you could just...
Aah! That hurt!
He didn't kidnap me. I ran away.
Oh, dear.
Oh, how frightfully upsetting.
Had I but known...
What do you mean?
Sadly, the boy's sentence has already been carried out.
What sentence?
Death.
- By beheading.
- No.
I am exceedingly sorry, Princess.
How could you?
So, how did it go?
I think she took it rather well.
It's all my fault, Rajah.
I didn't even know his name.
She was the princess.
I can't believe it.
I must have sounded so stupid to her.
Yoo-hoo! Aladdin! Hello!
Abu. Down here.
Come on, help me out of these.
Hey, she was in trouble.
Ah, she was worth it.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Don't worry, Abu.
I'll never see her again.
I'm a street rat, remember?
And there's a law.
She's gotta marry a prince.
- She deserves a prince.
- Ta-da!
I'm a fool.
You're only a fool if you give up, boy.
Who are you?
A lowly prisoner, like yourself.
But together, perhaps we can be more.
I'm listening.
There is a cave, boy, a Cave of Wonders, filled with treasures beyond your wildest dreams.
Ooh!
Treasure enough to impress even your princess, I'd wager.
Jafar, can you hurry up?
I'm dyin' in here.
But the law says only a prince can...
You've heard of the golden rule, haven't you?
Whoever has the gold makes the rules.
Why would you share all of this wonderful treasure with me?
I need a young pair of legs and a strong back to go in after it.
Uh, one problem.
It's out there. We're in here.
Uh-uh. Things aren't always what they seem.
So, do we have a deal?
Oh, I don't know.
Who disturbs my slumber?
Uh, it is I, Aladdin.
Proceed.
Touch nothing but the lamp.
Remember, boy, first fetch me the lamp, and then you shall have your reward.
Come on, Abu.
Would you look at that!
Just a handful of this stuff would make me richer than the sultan.
Abu!
Don't touch anything.
We gotta find that lamp.
Huh?
- Aladdin!
- Abu, will you knock it off?
Abu, what are you, crazy?
A magic carpet.
Come on. Come on out.
We're not gonna hurt you.
Hey, take it easy, Abu.
He's not gonna bite.
Thanks.
Wait a minute. Don't go.
Maybe you can help us.
Hey! Whoa!
You see, we're trying to find this lamp.
I think he knows where it is.
Wait here.
Oh!
This is it?
This is what we came all the way down here to...
Abu! No!
- Infidels!
- Uh-oh.
You have touched the forbidden treasure!
Now you will never again see the light of day!
Whoa!
Help! Help! Help!
Gotcha!
Carpet, let's move.
Abu!
Abu, this is no time to panic.
Start panicking.
Whoa!
- Help me out.
- Throw me the lamp.
I can't hold on. Give me your hand.
First give me the lamp.
Yes!
At last!
What are you doing?
Giving you your reward.
Your eternal reward.
It's mine.
It's all mine.
I... Where is it?
No.
No!
Jasmine?
Oh, dearest.
What's wrong?
Jafar has done something terrible.
There, there, my dear.
We'll set it right.
Now, tell me everything.
Oh.
Aladdin. Wake up.
Aladdin.
Oh! My head.
We're trapped.
That two-faced son of a jackal!
Whoever he was, he's long gone with that lamp.
Aha!
Why, you hairy little thief.
Looks like such a beat-up, worthless piece of junk.
Hey, I think there's something written here, but it's hard to make out.
Aah!
Oy!
10,000 years will give you such a crick in the neck.
Hang on a second.
Whoa! Whoa!
Does it feel good to be outta there.
I'm telling you, nice to be back, ladies and gentlemen.
Hi. Where you from?
What's your name?
Uh... Uh, Aladdin.
Aladdin. Hello, Aladdin.
Nice to have you on the show.
Can we call you Al?
Or maybe just Din?
How about Laddie? Sounds like,
"Here, boy. C'mon, laddie."
I must have hit my head harder than I thought.
Do you smoke? Mind if I do?
Oh, sorry, Cheeta. Hope
I didn't singe the fur.
Yo, Rugman. Haven't seen you in a few millennia.
Give me some tassel. Yeah. Yo, yo.
Say, you're a lot smaller than my last master.
Either that or I'm gettin' bigger.
Look at me from the side.
Do I look different to you?
Wait a minute. I'm your master?
That's right. He can be taught.
What would you wish of me?
The ever impressive, the long contained, the often imitated, but never duplicated...
Duplicated, duplicated...
Genie of the Lamp!
Right here direct from the lamp, right here for your very much wish fulfillment.
Thank you.
- Whoa. Wish fulfillment?
- Three wishes, to be exact.
And ixnay on the wishing for more wishes.
That's it. Three. Uno, dos, tres.
No substitutions, exchanges or refunds.
Now I know I'm dreaming.
Master, I don't think you quite realise what you've got here.
So why don't you just ruminate whilst
I illuminate the possibilities.
Well, Ali Baba had them 40 thieves
Scheherazade had a thousand tales
But, master, you're in luck
'Cause up your sleeves
You got a brand of magic never fails
You got some power
In your corner now
Some heavy ammunition in your camp
You got some punch, pizzazz
Yahoo and how
See, all you gotta do
Is rub that lamp and I'll say
"Mr Aladdin, sir
What will your pleasure be?"
Let me take your order
Jot it down
You ain't never had a friend like me
Life is your restaurant
And I'm your maitre d'
Come on, whisper what it is you want
You ain't never had a friend like me
Yes, sir
We pride ourselves on service
You're the boss, the king, the shah
Say what you wish
It's yours, true dish
How 'bout a little more baklava?
Have some of column A
Try all of column B
I'm in the mood to help you, dude
You ain't never had a friend like me
Oh, my
No, no
My, my
Can your friends do this?
Can your friends do that?
Can your friends pull this
Out their little hat?
Can your friends go poof
Hey, looky here
Ha-ha!
Can your friends go
"Abracadabra, let her rip"
And then make the sucker disappear?
So don't you sit there
Slack-jawed, buggy-eyed
I'm here to answer
All your midnight prayers
You got me bona fide certified
You got a genie
For your charge d'affaires
I got a powerful urge to help you out
So what's your wish?
I really wanna know
You got a list
That's three miles long, no doubt
All you gotta do is rub like so
Mr Aladdin, sir
Have a wish or two or three
I'm on the job, you big nabob
You ain't never had a friend
Never had a friend
You ain't never had a friend
Like me
Ah-ha-ha!
Wah-ha-ha!
You ain't never had a friend like me
Huh?
So, what'll it be, master?
You're gonna grant me any three wishes I want, right?
Ah, almost.
There are a few provisos, a couple of quid pro quos.
Like?
Ah, rule number one,
I can't kill anybody.
So don't ask.
Rule number two.
I can't make anybody fall in love with anybody else.
You little ponem there.
Rule number three. I can't bring people back from the dead.
It's not a pretty picture.
I don't like doing it.
Other than that, you got it.
- Hmm.
- Oh!
Provisos? You mean limitations?
On wishes? Some all-powerful genie.
Can't even bring people back from the dead.
I don't know, Abu. He probably can't even get us out of this cave.
Looks like we're gonna have to find a way out of here.
Excuse me?
Are you lookin' at me?
Did you rub my lamp?
Did you wake me up?
Did you bring me here?
And all of sudden you're walking out on me?
I don't think so, not right now.
You're gettin' your wishes, so sit down!
In case of emergency, the exits are here, here, here, here, anywhere.
Keep your hands and arms inside the carpet.
We're...
Outta here!
Jafar, this is an outrage.
If it weren't for all your years of loyal service...
From now on, you are to discuss sentencing of prisoners with me, before they are beheaded.
I assure you, Your Highness, it won't happen again.
Jasmine...
Jafar. Let's put this whole messy business behind us.
Please.
My most abject and humblest apologies to you as well, Princess.
At least some good will come of my being forced to marry.
When I am queen, I will have the power to get rid of you.
There, now. That's nice.
All settled, then.
Now, Jasmine, getting back to this suitor business... Jasmine?
Jasmine!
If only I had gotten that lamp.
"I will have the power to get rid of you."
To think we gotta keep kissing up to that chump and his chump daughter
- for the rest of our lives...
- No, Iago.
Only until she finds a chump husband.
Then she'll have us banished.
Or beheaded.
Eww!
Oh. Wait a minute. Jafar.
What if you were the chump husband?
What?
Okay, you marry the princess, all right?
And, uh, then you become the sultan.
Oh.
Marry the shrew.
I become the sultan.
- The idea has merit.
- Yes, merit. Yes.
And then we drop papa-in-law and the little woman off a cliff.
Yaaah!
Kersplat!
I love the way your foul little mind works.
Thank you for choosing Magic
Carpet for all your travel needs.
Don't stand until the rug has come to a complete stop.
Thank you. Goodbye now.
Good-bye. Thank you.
Well, how about that,
Mr Doubting Mustafa?
Oh, you sure showed me.
Now, about my three wishes.
Dost mine ears deceive me?
Three? You are down by one, boy.
Ah, no. I never actually wished to get out of the cave.
You did that on your own.
Well, I feel sheepish.
All right, you bad boy, but no more freebies.
Fair deal. So, three wishes.
I want them to be good.
What would you wish for?
Me?
No one's ever asked me that before.
Well, in my case... Ah, forget it.
- What?
- No, I can't. I...
Come on. Tell me.
Freedom.
You're a prisoner?
It's all part and parcel of the whole genie gig.
Phenomenal cosmic powers...
Itty bitty living space.
Genie, that's terrible.
But, oh, to be free...
Not have to go, "Poof.
What do you need?
"Poof. What do you need?
Poof. What do you need?"
To be my own master.
Such a thing would be greater than all the magic and all the treasures in all the world.
But what am I talking about?
Let's get real here.
It's not gonna happen.
Genie, wake up and smell the hummus.
Why not?
The only way I get outta this is if my master wishes me out.
So you can guess how often that's happened.
I'll do it. I'll set you free.
- Uh-huh, yeah, right.
- No, really, I promise.
After I make my first two wishes,
I'll use my third wish to set you free.
Well, here's hopin'. All right.
Let's make some magic.
So how 'bout it? What is it you want most?
Well, there's this girl.
Wrong.
I can't make anybody fall in love, remember?
Oh, but, Genie, she's smart and fun and...
- Pretty?
- Beautiful.
She's got these eyes that just... And this hair. Wow.
And her smile...
Ami.
C'est l'amour.
But she's the princess.
To even have a chance,
I'd have to be...
Hey, can you make me a prince?
Let's see here.
Chicken à la king? Nope.
Alaskan king crab. Ow.
I hate it when they do that.
Caesar salad. Ah! Et tu, Brute? No.
Aha. "To make a prince."
Is that an official wish?
Say the magic words.
Genie, I wish for you to make me a prince.
All right!
Yo, yo! Woof! Woof!
First, that fez-and-vest combo is much too third century.
These patches. What are we trying to say, beggar?
No. Let's work with me here.
Ooh. I like it. Muy macho.
Now, it still needs something.
What does it say to me?
It says mode of transportation.
Excuse me, monkey boy.
Aquí. Over here.
- Uh-oh.
- Here he comes.
What better way to make your entrance on the streets of Agrabah than riding your very own, brand-new camel?
Watch out. They spit.
Mmm. Not enough.
Still not enough. Let's see.
What do you need?
Yes!
Esalalumbo shimin Dumbo.
Whoa!
Talk about your trunk space.
Check this action out.
Abu, you look good.
He's got the outfit.
He's got the elephant.
But we're not through yet.
Hang on to your turban, kid.
We're gonna make you a star.
Sire, I've found a solution to the problem with your daughter.
Awk. The problem with your daughter.
Oh, really?
Right here.
"If the princess has not chosen a husband by the appointed time,
"then the sultan shall choose for her."
But Jasmine hated all those suitors.
How could I choose someone she hates?
Not to worry, my liege.
There is more.
"If in the event a suitable prince cannot be found..."
Jerk.
"A princess must then be wed to..."
Hmm. Interesting.
What? Who?
The royal vizier.
Why, that would be me.
But I thought the law says that only a prince can marry a princess.
I'm quite sure that...
Desperate times call for desperate measures, my lord.
Yes. Desperate measures.
You will order the princess to marry me.
I will order the princess to...
But you're so old.
The princess will marry me.
The princess will marry...
What? What is that?
That music.
Jafar, you must come and see this.
Make way for Prince Ali
Say, "Hey, it's Prince Ali"
Hey, clear the way in the old bazaar
Hey you, let us through
It's a bright new star
Oh come, be the first on your block
To meet his eye
Make way, here he comes
Ring bells, bang the drums
You're gonna love this guy
Prince Ali, fabulous he
Ali Ababwa
Genuflect, show some respect
Down on one knee
Now, try your best to stay calm
Brush up your Sunday salaam
Then come and meet
His spectacular coterie
Prince Ali, mighty is he
Ali Ababwa
Strong as 10 regular men definitely
He faced the galloping hordes
A hundred bad guys with swords
Who sent those goons to their lords? Why, Prince Ali
He's got 75 golden camels
Don't they look lovely, June?
Purple peacocks, he's got 53
Fabulous, Harry.
I love the feathers.
When it comes to exotic-type mammals
Has he got a zoo
I'm telling you
It's a world-class menagerie
Prince Ali, handsome is he
Ali Ababwa
That physique, how can I speak
Weak at the knee
Well, get on out in that square
Adjust your veil and prepare
To gawk and grovel and stare
At Prince Ali
- He's got 95 white Persian monkeys
- He's got the monkeys
- Let's see the monkeys
- And to view them he charges no fee
He's generous
So generous
He's got slaves
He's got servants and flunkies
Proud to work for him
They bow to his whim, love serving him
They're just lousy with loyalty to Ali
Prince Ali
Prince Ali, Amorous he
Ali Ababwa
Heard your princess
Was a sight lovely to see
And that, good people, is why
He got dolled up and dropped by
With 60 elephants, llamas galore
With bears and lions
A brass band and more
With his 40 fakirs
His cooks, his bakers
His birds that warble on key
Make way
For Prince Ali
Splendid. Absolutely marvellous.
Your Majesty,
I have journeyed from afar to seek your daughter's hand.
Prince Ali Ababwa.
Of course. I'm delighted to meet you.
This is my royal vizier,
Jafar. He's delighted, too.
Ecstatic.
- I'm afraid, Prince Abubu...
- Ababwa.
Whatever.
You cannot just parade in here uninvited and expect to...
By Allah, this is quite a remarkable device.
Ooh.
I don't suppose I might...
Why, certainly,
Your Majesty. Allow me.
Sire, I must advise against this.
Oh, button up, Jafar.
Learn to have a little fun.
Ow, ow, ow.
Ahh! Whoa!
Look out, here I come.
Just where did you say you were from?
Oh, much farther than you've travelled, I'm sure.
- Try me.
- Look out, Polly.
Hey, watch it.
Watch it with the dumb rug.
Aah!
Whew!
Out of the way. I'm coming in to land.
Jafar, watch this.
- Spectacular, Your Highness.
- That was lovely.
Yes, I do seem to have a knack for it.
This is a very impressive youth.
And a prince besides.
If we're lucky, you won't have to marry Jasmine after all.
- I don't trust him, Sire.
- Nonsense.
One thing I pride myself on, Jafar,
I'm an excellent judge of character.
Oh, excellent judge.
Yeah, sure. Not!
Jasmine will like this one.
And I'm pretty sure I'll like Princess Jasmine.
Your Highness, no. I must intercede on Jasmine's behalf.
This boy is no different from the others.
What makes him think he is worthy of the princess?
Your Majesty, I am
Prince Ali Ababwa.
Just let her meet me.
I will win your daughter.
How dare you.
All of you. Standing around deciding my future?
I am not a prize to be won.
Oh, dear.
Don't worry, Prince Ali. Just give Jasmine time to cool down.
I think it's time to say good-bye to Prince Abubu.
What am I gonna do?
Jasmine won't even let me talk to her.
I should've known I couldn't pull off this stupid prince wish.
So move.
Hey.
That's a good move.
I can't believe it.
I'm losing to a rug.
Genie, I need help.
All right, Sparky, here's the deal.
If you wanna court the little lady, you gotta be a straight shooter.
- Do you got it?
- What?
No way.
If Jasmine found out I was really some crummy street rat, she'd laugh at me.
A woman appreciates a man who can make her laugh.
Al, all joking aside, you really ought to be yourself.
Hey, that's the last thing I wanna be.
Okay, I'm gonna go see her.
I just... I gotta be smooth, cool, confident.
How do I look?
Like a prince.
Princess Jasmine?
- Who's there?
- It's me, Prince Ali.
Ahem. Uh, Prince Ali Ababwa.
I do not want to see you.
No, no, please, Princess.
Give me a chance.
- Just leave me alone.
- Down, kitty.
So, how's our little beau doing?
Good kitty, take off.
Down, kitty.
Wait. Wait.
Do I know you?
Uh, no. No.
You remind me of someone
I met in the marketplace.
The marketplace?
I have servants who go to the marketplace for me.
Why, I even have servants who go to the marketplace for my servants, so it couldn't have been me you met.
No. I guess not.
Enough about you,
Casanova. Talk about her.
She's smart, fun, the hair, the eyes.
Anything. Pick a feature.
Ahem. Uh, Princess
Jasmine? You're very...
Wonderful, magnificent, glorious,
- punctual.
- Punctual.
- Punctual?
- Sorry.
- Uh, beautiful.
- Nice recovery.
Hmm.
I'm rich, too, you know.
- Yeah.
- The daughter of a sultan.
I know.
A fine prize for any prince to marry.
Uh, right. Right. A prince like me.
Warning! Warning!
Right. A prince like you.
And every other stuffed shirt, swaggering peacock I've met.
Mayday! Mayday!
Just go jump off a balcony!
- What?
- Stop her. Stop her!
- Want me to sting her?
- Buzz off.
Okay, fine. But remember,
"bee" yourself.
- Yeah, right.
- What?
Uh... Uh, you're right.
You aren't just some prize to be won.
You should be free to make your own choice.
I'll go now.
- No!
- What? What?
How...
How are you doing that?
- It's a magic carpet.
- It's lovely.
You, uh...
You don't want to go for a ride, do you?
We could get out of the palace, see the world.
- Is it safe?
- Sure. Do you trust me?
- What?
- Do you trust me?
Yes.
I can show you the world
Shining, shimmering, splendid
Tell me, Princess
Now, when did you last
Let your heart decide
I can open your eyes
Take you wonder by wonder
Over, sideways and under
On a magic carpet ride
A whole new world
A new fantastic point of view
No one to tell us no
Or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming
A whole new world
A dazzling place
I never knew
But when I'm way up here
It's crystal clear
That now I'm in
A whole new world with you
Now I'm in
A whole new world with you
Unbelievable sights
Indescribable feeling
Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling
Through an endless diamond sky
- A whole new world
- Don't you dare close your eyes
- A hundred thousand things to see
- Hold your breath, it gets better
I'm like a shooting star
I've come so far
I can't go back to where I used to be
- A whole new world
- Every turn a surprise
- With new horizons to pursue
- Every moment red-letter
I'll chase them anywhere
There's time to spare
Let me share
This whole new world with you
- A whole new world
- A whole new world
- That's where we'll be
- That's where we'll be
- A thrilling chase
- A wondrous place
For you and me
- It's all so magical.
- Yeah.
It's a shame Abu had to miss this.
Nah. He hates fireworks.
He doesn't like flying, either.
Uh, that is, um... Oh, no.
You are the boy from the market. I knew it.
- Why did you lie to me?
- Jasmine, I'm sorry.
- Did you think I was stupid?
- No.
- That I wouldn't figure it out?
- No.
I mean, I hoped you wouldn't.
No, that's not what I meant.
Who are you? Tell me the truth.
The truth?
The truth. Um...
The truth is...
I sometimes dress as a commoner, um, to escape the pressures of palace life.
But I really am a prince.
Why didn't you just tell me?
Well, you know, royalty going out into the city in disguise, it sounds a little strange, don't you think?
Hmm.
Not that strange.
Good night, my handsome prince.
Sleep well, Princess.
Yes!
For the first time in my life, things are starting to go right.
Abu. Abu.
Hold him.
I'm afraid you've worn out your welcome, Prince Abubu.
Why, you...
Make sure he's never found.
Never fails. You get in the bath and there's a rub at the lamp.
Hello? AI?
Al! Kid, snap out of it.
You can't cheat on this one.
I can't help unless you make a wish.
You have to say, "Genie, I want you to save my life." Got it?
Come on, Aladdin!
I'll take that as a yes.
Up scope.
Don't you scare me like that.
Genie, I, uh...
I...
- Thanks, Genie.
- Oh, Al.
I'm gettin' kind of fond of you, kid.
Not that I wanna pick out curtains or anything.
Jasmine.
Oh, Father, I just had the most wonderful time.
- I'm so happy.
- You should be, Jasmine.
I have chosen a husband for you.
- What?
- You will wed Jafar.
You're speechless, I see.
A fine quality in a wife.
I will never marry you.
- Father, I choose Prince Ali.
- Prince Ali left.
Better check your crystal ball again, Jafar.
Prince Ali!
How in the... Uh. Awk!
Tell them the truth, Jafar.
You tried to have me killed.
What? Ridiculous nonsense, Your Highness.
He is obviously lying.
Obviously lying.
Father, what's wrong with you?
I know what's wrong.
Oh, my!
Your Highness, Jafar's been controlling you with this.
What? Jafar?
You, you traitor!
Your Majesty, all this can be explained.
Guards! Guards!
Well, that's it.
We're dead. Forget it.
Just dig a grave for both of us. We're dead.
Arrest Jafar at once.
This is not done yet, boy.
Find him! Search everywhere!
- Jasmine, are you all right?
- Yes.
Jafar, my most trusted counsellor, plotting against me all this time.
This is horrible, just horrible.
How will I ever...
Huh?
Can this be true?
My daughter has finally chosen a suitor?
Ha, ha! Praise Allah!
You brilliant boy,
I could kiss you.
I won't. I'll leave that to my...
But you two will be wed at once.
Yes, yes. And you'll be happy and prosperous, and then you, my boy, will become sultan.
- Sultan?
- Yes.
A fine upstanding youth such as yourself, a person of your unimpeachable moral character is exactly what this kingdom needs.
We gotta get outta here. I gotta start packing. Only essentials.
We gotta travel light.
Bring the guns, the weapons, the knives, and how about this picture?
I think I'm making a weird face in it.
Oh, boy. He's cracked.
He's gone nuts.
Jafar! Jafar! Get a grip!
Good grip.
Prince Ali is nothing more than that ragged urchin, Aladdin.
- He has the lamp, Iago.
- Why, that miserable...
But you are going to relieve him of it.
Me?
Sultan?
They want me to be Sultan?
Huzzah!
Hail the conquering hero
Aladdin, you've just won the heart of the princess.
What are you gonna do next?
Psst. Your line is, "I'm going to free the genie."
Any time.
- Genie. I can't.
- Sure you can.
You just go, "Genie,
I wish you free."
I'm serious.
Look, I'm sorry. I really am.
But they wanna make me sultan.
No. They wanna make
Prince Ali sultan.
Without you, I'm just Aladdin.
- Al, you won.
- Because of you.
The only reason anyone thinks I'm worth anything is because of you.
What if they find out I'm not really a prince?
What if Jasmine finds out?
I'd lose her.
Genie, I can't keep this up on my own.
I can't wish you free.
Fine. I understand. After all, you've lied to everyone else.
Hey, I was beginning to feel left out.
Now, if you'll excuse me, master.
Genie, I'm really sorry.
Well, fine. Then just stay in there.
What are you guys looking at?
Look, I... I'm sorry.
Abu, I'm sorry. I didn't...
Wait. Come on.
What am I doing?
Genie's right.
I gotta tell Jasmine the truth.
Ali. Oh, Ali. Will you come here?
Well, here goes.
Jasmine? Where are you?
Out in the menagerie. Hurry.
I'm coming.
You got a problem, Pinky?
Jerk.
Boy, Jafar's gonna be happy to see you.
"Excellent work, Iago."
Ah, go on.
"No, really. On a scale of one to 10, you are an 11."
Oh, Jafar, you're too kind.
I'm embarrassed. I'm blushing.
People of Agrabah, my daughter has finally chosen a suitor.
Jasmine.
Ali, where have you been?
Jasmine, there's something
I got to tell you.
The whole kingdom's turned out for Father's announcement.
No. But, Jasmine, listen to me, please.
- You don't understand...
- Good luck.
Ali Ababwa!
Oh, boy.
Look at them, cheering that little pipsqueak.
Let them cheer.
You know, Al, I'm getting really...
I don't think you're him.
Tonight, the part of Al will be played by a tall, dark and sinister ugly man.
- I am your master now.
- I was afraid of that.
Genie, grant me my first wish.
I wish to rule on high as sultan.
- Whoa!
- Bless my soul.
What is this? What's going on?
Oh, my goodness, what's happening?
Father.
Jafar, you vile betrayer.
That's Sultan Vile Betrayer to you.
Oh, yeah? We'll just see about that.
The lamp.
Finders keepers, Abubu.
Genie, no!
Sorry, kid. I got a new master now.
Jafar, I order you to stop.
Ah, but there's a new order now.
My order.
Finally, you will bow to me.
We will never bow to you.
Why am I not surprised?
If you won't bow before a sultan, then you will cower before a sorcerer!
Genie, my second wish...
I wish to be the most powerful sorcerer in the world!
Genie, stop!
Ladies and gentlemen, a warm Agrabah welcome for Sorcerer Jafar!
Now, where were we?
Ah, yes. Abject humiliation.
Down, boy.
Oh, Princess.
There's someone I'm dying to introduce you to.
Jafar. Get your hands off her.
Prince Ali
Yes, it is he
But not as you know him
Read my lips
And come to grips with reality
Yes, meet a blast from your past
Whose lies were too good to last
Say hello
To your precious Prince Ali
Or should we say Aladdin?
Ali?
Jasmine, I tried to tell you. I'm just...
So Ali turns out to be
Merely Aladdin
Just a con, need I go on
Take it from me
His personality flaws
Give me adequate cause
To send him packing
On a one-way trip
Genie!
So his prospects
Take a terminal dip
His assets frozen, the venue chosen
Is the ends of the Earth, whoopee!
- So long!
- Good-bye, see ya.
Ex-Prince Ali
Abu.
Abu!
Oh, this is all my fault.
I should have freed the genie when I had the chance.
- Abu. Are you okay?
- Mmm-hmm.
I'm sorry, Abu.
I made a mess of everything.
Somehow, I gotta go back and set things right.
Carpet.
Abu, start digging.
That's it.
Yeah! All right!
Now, back to Agrabah. Let's go.
Puppet ruler want a cracker?
Here's your cracker. Shove them all the way down your throat.
Here. Have lots.
Stop it. Jafar, leave him alone.
It pains me to see you reduced to this, Jasmine.
A beautiful desert bloom such as yourself should be on the arm of the most powerful man in the world.
What do you say, my dear?
Why, with you as my queen...
Never.
I'll teach you some respect.
No. Genie.
I have decided to make my final wish.
I wish for Princess Jasmine to fall desperately in love with me.
Ah, Master, there are a few addendas, some quid pro quos...
Don't talk back to me, you big blue lout.
You will do what I order you to do, slave.
Jafar.
I never realised how incredibly handsome you are.
Mmm. That's better.
Now, pussycat, tell me more about myself.
You're tall, dark, well dressed...
AI. AI, little buddy.
Shh.
Al, I can't help you.
I work for Señor Psychopath now. What are you gonna do?
Hey, I'm a street rat, remember? I'll improvise.
Cute little gaps between your teeth.
Go on.
And your beard is so twisted.
- You've stolen my heart.
- Jafar...
And the street rat?
What street rat?
Yech!
That was...
You!
How many times do I have to kill you, boy?
Get the lamp.
No!
Ah, ah, ah, Princess.
Your time is up.
Jasmine.
Oh, nice shot, Jaf...
Don't toy with me.
Abu!
Things are unravelling fast now, boy.
Get the point?
I'm just getting warmed up.
Are you afraid to fight me yourself, you cowardly snake?
A snake, am I?
Perhaps you'd like to see how snakelike I can be.
Rick 'em, rack 'em, rock 'em, rake
Stick that sword into that snake
You stay out of this.
Jafar, Jafar, he's our man.
If he can't do it... Great!
Aladdin.
Jasmine, hang on.
You little fool.
You thought you could defeat the most powerful being on Earth.
Squeeze him, Jafar.
Squeeze him like a... Awk!
Without the genie, boy, you're nothing.
The genie. The genie.
The genie has more power than you'll ever have.
What?
He gave you your power.
He can take it away.
Al, what are you doing? Why are you bringing me into this?
Face it, Jafar. You're still just second best.
You're right.
His power does exceed my own.
But not for long.
The boy is crazy. He's a little punch-drunk.
One too many hits with the snake.
Slave, I make my third wish.
I wish to be an all-powerful genie!
All right, your wish is my command. Way to go, Al.
Yes.
Yes!
The power.
The absolute power!
- What have you done?
- Trust me.
The universe is mine to command, to control!
Not so fast, Jafar. Aren't you forgetting something?
- Huh?
- You wanted to be a genie, you got it.
What?
And everything that goes with it.
- No! No!
- I'm gettin' out of here.
Phenomenal cosmic powers...
You're the genie. I don't want...
Itty bitty living space.
Al, you little genius, you.
Ahh!
Get your blasted beak out of my face.
- Oh, shut up, you moron.
- Don't tell me to shut up.
Allow me.
Ten thousand years in a Cave of
Wonders ought to chill him out.
Shut up!
Jasmine...
I'm sorry I lied to you about being a prince.
I know why you did.
Well, I guess this is good-bye?
Oh, that stupid law.
This isn't fair.
I love you.
Al, no problem. You've still got one wish left.
Just say the word and you're a prince again.
But, Genie, what about your freedom?
Hey, it's only an eternity of servitude.
This is love.
Al, you're not gonna find another girl like her in a million years.
Believe me, I know. I've looked.
Jasmine, I do love you, but I got to stop pretending to be something I'm not.
I understand.
Genie, I wish for your freedom.
One bona fide prince pedigree coming up.
- What?
- Genie, you're free.
I'm free. I'm free.
Quick. Quick. Wish for something outrageous.
Say, "I want the Nile."
Wish for the Nile. Try that.
- Uh, I wish for the Nile.
- No way!
Oh, does that feel good! Oh!
I'm free! I'm free at last!
I'm hittin' the road. I'm off to see the world. I'm...
Genie, I'm...
I'm gonna miss you.
Me, too, Al.
No matter what anybody says, you'll always be a prince to me.
That's right.
You've certainly proven your worth as far as I'm concerned.
It's that law that's the problem.
- Father?
- Well, am I sultan or am I sultan?
From this day forth, the princess shall marry whomever she deems worthy.
Him. I choose...
I choose you, Aladdin.
Call me Al.
Oh, all of you, come over here. Big group hug.
Group hug.
Mind if I kiss the monkey?
Ooh, hairball.
Well, I can't do any more damage around this Popsicle stand.
I'm outta here!
Bye-bye, you two crazy lovebirds!
Hey, Rugman, ciao. I'm history.
No, I'm mythology.
I don't care what I am. I'm free!
A whole new world
A whole new life
For you and me
A whole new world
Made you look.
You have been a fabulous audience.
Tell you what, you're the best audience in the whole world.
Take care of yourselves.
Good night, Alice!
Good night, Agrabah! Adiós, amigos!
All right, everyone! This is a stickup!
Don't anybody move!
Now empty that safe.
- Money, money, money!
- Stop it! Stop it, you mean old potato.
Quiet, Bo Peep, or your sheep get run over!
Help! Baa! Help us!
Oh, no, not my sheep!
Somebody, do something!
Reach for the sky.
Oh, no! Sheriff Woody!
I'm here to stop you,
One-Eyed Bart.
- How'd you know it was me?
- Are you gonna come quietly?
You can't touch me, Sheriff.
I brought my attack dog with the built-in force field.
Well, I brought my dinosaur who eats force-field dogs.
- Yipe, yipe, yipe, yipe!
You're going to jail, Bart.
Say good-bye to the wife and tater tots.
You saved the day again, Woody.
You're my favorite deputy.
# You've got a friend in me #
Come on, let's wrangle up the cattle.
# When the road looks rough ahead #
# And you're miles and miles from your nice, warm bed #
Round 'em up, cowboy.
# Just remember what your old pal said #
# Boy, you've got a friend in me #
Yee-haw!
# Yeah, you've got a friend in me #
Hey, cowboy!
# Some other folks might be a little bit smarter than I am #
# Big and stronger too #
Come on, Woody.
# Maybe #
# But none of them will ever love you the way I do #
# It's me and you, boy #
# And as the years go by #
# Our friendship will never die #
# You're gonna see it's our destiny #
# You've got a friend in me #
All right!
# Yeah, you've got a friend in me #
Score!
# You've got a friend in me #
Wow! Cool!
- What do you think?
- Oh, this looks great, Mom!
Okay, birthday boy.
We saw that at the store!
I asked you for it!
- I hope I have enough places.
- Wow, look at that! That's so...
- Oh, my gosh, you got...
- One, two... four.
Yeah,
I think that's going to be enough.
- Can we leave this up 'til we move?
- Well, sure.
- We can leave it up.
- Yeah!
Now go get Molly.
Your friends are gonna be here any minute.
- Okay!
- It's party time, Woody.
Yee-haw!
Howdy, little lady.
Somebody's poisoned the water hole.
Come on, Molly.
Oh, you're getting heavy.
See you later, Woody!
Pull my string!
The birthday party's today?
Okay, everybody, coast is clear!
Ages three and up.
It's on my box.
<b>"Ages three and up."</b>
I'm not supposed to be baby-sitting Princess Drool.
Hey, Hamm, look.
I'm Picasso!
- I don't get it.
- You uncultured swine.
What are you looking at, ya hockey puck?
- Uh, hey, Sarge, have you seen Slinky?
- Sir! No, sir!
Okay. Hey, thank you.
At ease.
- Hey, uh, Slinky?
- Right here, Woody. I-I'm red this time.
No, S-Slink...
Oh, well, all right.
You can be red if you want.
N-Not now, Slink.
I got some bad news.
- Bad news?
- Shh, shh, shh!
Just gather everyone up for a staff meeting, and be happy.
Got it.
Be happy!
Staff meeting, everybody!
Snake, Robot, podium, please.
Hey, Etch. Draw!
Oh! Got me again.
Etch, you've been working on that draw.
Fastest knobs in the West.
Uh, got a staff meeting, you guys. Come on, let's go.
Now, where is that... Oh.
Hey, who moved my doodle pad way over here?
- Uh, how're you doin', Rex?
- Were you scared? Tell me honestly.
I was close to being scared that time.
Oh, I'm going for fearsome here, but I just don't feel it!
I think I'm just coming off as annoying.
Ow! Oh, hi, Bo. Hi.
I wanted to thank you, Woody, for saving my flock.
Oh, hey, it was, uh, nothin'.
What do you say I get someone else to watch the sheep tonight?
Oh, yeah.
I...
Remember, I'm just a couple of blocks away.
Come on, come on.
Smaller toys up front.
Hey, Woody, come on.
Oh, thanks, Mike.
Okay... Oh, whoa. Step back.
- For crying out loud.
- Okay. Thank you.
Hello. Check.
That better? Great.
Everybody hear me?
Up on the shelf, can you hear me? Great.
Okay, first item today: uh, oh, yeah... has everyone picked a moving buddy?
- What?
- Moving buddy? You can't be serious.
Well, I didn't know we were supposed to have one already.
Do we have to hold hands?
- Oh, yeah.
- You guys think this is a big joke.
We've only got one week left before the move.
I don't want any toys left behind.
A moving buddy.
If you don't have one, get one!
All right, next.
Uh, oh, yes.
Tuesday night's plastic corrosion awareness meeting... was, I think, a big success, and we want to thank Mr. Spell for putting that on for us.
- Thank you, Mr. Spell.
You're welcome.
Okay. Uh, oh, yes.
One, uh, minor note here.
Andy's birthday party has been moved to today.
Uh, next we have...
- Wait a minute.
What do you mean the party's today?
- His birthday's not 'til next week!
- What's goin' on down there?
Is his mom losin' her marbles?
Well, obviously, she wanted to have the party before the move.
- I'm not worried.
- You shouldn't be worried.
Of course Woody ain't worried.
He's been Andy's favorite since kindergarten.
- Hey, hey.
- Come on, Potato Head.
If Woody says it's all right, then, well, darn it, it's good enough for me.
Woody has never steered us wrong before.
Come on, guys. Every Christmas and birthday we go through this.
But what if Andy gets another dinosaur, a mean one?
I just don't think I could take that kind of rejection!
Hey, listen.
No one's getting replaced.
This is Andy we're talking about.
It doesn't matter how much we're played with.
What matters is that we're here for Andy when he needs us.
That's what we're made for, right?
Pardon me. I hate to break up the staff meeting, but they're here!
- Birthday guests at three o'clock!
- Stay calm, everyone!
Hey!
Uh, meeting adjourned.
Ho, boy, will you take a look at all those presents?
I can't see a thing.
Yes, sir. We're next month's garage sale fodder for sure.
- Any dinosaur-shaped ones?
- Oh, for crying out loud.
- They're all in boxes, you idiot.
- They're getting bigger!
Wait, there's a nice little one over there.
Hi!
 Spell: trash can.
- We're doomed!
All right. All right!
If I send out the troops, will you all calm down?
- Yes! Yes! We promise!
- Okay! Save your batteries.
Eh, very good, Woody.
That's using the old noodle.
Sergeant, establish a recon post downstairs. Code Red!
- You know what to do.
- Yes, sir!
All right, men.
You heard him. Code Red!
Repeat: we are at Code Red.
Recon plan Charlie. Execute!
Let's move, move, move, move, move!
Okay. Come on, kids.
Everyone in the living room.
It's almost time for the presents.
All right, gangway, gangway.
And this is how we find out... what is in those presents.
Okay! Who's hungry?
Here come the chips!
I've got Cool Ranch and barbecue! Ow!
What in the world? Oh!
I thought I told him to pick these up.
Shouldn't they be there by now?
What's taking them so long?
Hey, these guys are professionals.
They're the best.
Come on. They're not lying down on the job.
G-Go on without me.
Just go.
A good soldier never leaves a man behind.
Okay, everybody.
Come on.
Settle down. Now, kids.
Everybody... You sit in a circle.
No, Andy. Andy, you sit in the middle there.
Good. And which present are you gonna open first?
There they are.
Come in, Mother Bird.
This is Alpha Bravo.
- This is it! This is it!
- Come in, Mother Bird.
- Quiet, quiet, quiet!
- All right
Andy's opening the first present now.
Mrs. Potato Head! Mrs. Potato Head!
Mrs. Potato Head!
- Hey, I can dream, can't I?
- The bow's coming off.
He's ripping the wrapping paper.
It's a... It's... It's a...
A lunch box.
We've got a lunch box here.
A lunch box?
- A lunch box?
- For the lunch.
Okay, second present.
It appears to be...
- Okay, it's bed sheets.
- Who invited that kid?
Oh! Only one left.
- Okay, we're on the last present now.
- Last present!
It's a big one. It's a...
It's a board game! Repeat: Battleship.
- Yay!
- Hallelujah!
- Yeah, all right.
- Hey! Watch it!
Sorry there, old spud head.
Mission accomplished. Well done, men.
Pack it up. We're goin' home.
So did I tell you? Huh?
Nothin' to worry about.
I knew you were right all along, Woody.
Never doubted you for a second.
Wait a minute.
Oh, what do we have here? Ohh!
Wait!
Turn that thing back on!
Come in, Mother Bird.
Come in, Mother Bird.
Mom has pulled a surprise present from the closet.
Andy's opening it.
He's really excited about this one.
- Mom! What is it?
- It's a huge package.
Oh, get outta the... One of the kids is in the way. I can't see.
It's a...
It's a what?
What is it?
- Oh, no!
- Oh, ya big lizard!
Now we'll never know what it is!
Way to go, Rex!
- No, no! Turn 'em around!
Turn 'em around!
Oh, he's puttin'
'em in backwards.
You're... You're puttin' 'em in backwards!
Plus is positive, minus is negative! Oh, let me!
Let's go to my room, guys!
Red alert! Red alert!
Andy is coming upstairs!
- There!
- Juvenile intrusion. 
Repeat, resume your positions now!
Andy's coming, everybody!
Back to your places! Hurry!
Get to your places!
Get to your places!
Where's my ear? Who's seen my ear?
Did you see my ear?
Out of my way! Here I come!
Here I come! Ohh!
Hey, look!
Its lasers light up.
- Take that, Zurg!
- Quick, make a space.
This is where the spaceship lands.
And he does it back, and he does a karate-chop action.
Come on down, guys!
It's time for games!
- We got prizes!
- Oh, yeah!
- What is it?
- Can you see it?
What the heck is up there?
Woody, who's up there with ya?
Woody, what are you doing under the bed?
Uh, nothin'.
Uh, nothin'.
I'm sure Andy was just a little excited, that's all.
Too much cake and ice cream, I suppose.
It's just a mistake!
Well, that mistake is sitting in your spot, Woody.
- Oh! Have you been replaced?
- Hey, what did I tell you earlier?
No one is getting replaced.
Now, let's all be polite and give whatever it is up there... a nice, big
Andy's-room welcome.
Buzz Lightyear to Star Command.
Come in, Star Command.
Star Command, come in.
Do you read me?
Why don't they answer?
My ship!
Blast! This'll take weeks to repair.
Buzz Lightyear mission log, stardate 4-0-7-2.
My ship has run off course en route to sector 12.
I've crash-landed on a strange planet.
The impact must've awoken me from hypersleep.
Terrain seems a bit unstable.
No readout yet if the air is breathable.
And there seems to be no sign of intelligent life anywhere.
Hello!
Whoa! He-Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Did I frighten you?
Didn't mean to. Sorry.
Howdy. My name is Woody... and this is Andy's room.
That's all I wanted to say.
And also, there has been a bit of a mix-up.
This is my spot, see... the bed here.
Local law enforcement.
It's about time you got here.
I'm Buzz Lightyear, Space Ranger,
Universe Protection Unit.
My ship has crash-landed here by mistake.
Yes, it is a mistake, because, you see, the bed here is my spot.
I need to repair my turbo boosters.
Do you people still use fossil fuels, or have you discovered crystallic fusion?
Well, let's see.
We got double-A's.
- Watch yourself! Halt! Who goes there?
- Don't shoot!
- It's okay. Friends.
- Do you know these life-forms?
Yes. They're Andy's toys.
All right, everyone.
You're clear to come up.
I am Buzz Lightyear.
I come in peace.
Oh, I'm so glad you're not a dinosaur!
All right, thank you.
Now, thank you all for your kind welcome.
- Say, what's that button do?
- I'll show you.
- Buzz Lightyear to the rescue.
- Wow!
Hey, Woody's got something like that.
His is a pull string, only it's...
- Only it sounds like a car ran over it.
- Oh, yeah, but not like this one.
This is a quality sound system.
Probably all copper wiring, huh? So, uh, where you from? Singapore? Hong Kong?
Well, no. Actually, l-I'm...
I'm stationed up in the
Gamma Quadrant of Sector Four.
As a member of the elite Universe
Protection Unit of the Space Ranger Corps,
I protect the galaxy from the threat of invasion... from the evil Emperor Zurg, sworn enemy of the Galactic Alliance.
Oh, really?
I'm from Playskool.
And I'm from Mattel.
Well, I'm not really from Mattel.
I'm actually from a smaller company that was purchased in a leveraged buyout.
You'd think they'd never seen a new toy before.
Well, sure, look at him. He's got more gadgets on him than a Swiss Army knife.
Ah, ah, ah, ah!
Please be careful.
You don't want to be in the way when my laser goes off.
Hey, a laser! How come you don't have a laser, Woody?
It's not a laser. It's a...
It's a little light bulb that blinks.
- What's with him?
- Laser envy.
All right, that's enough!
Look, we're all very impressed with Andy's new toy.
- Toy?
- T-O-Y. TOY!
Excuse me. l-I think the word you're searching for is "Space Ranger".
The word I'm searching for I can't say because there's preschool toys present.
Gettin' kind of tense, aren't ya?
Oh, uh, Mr. Lightyear, uh, now, I'm curious.
What does a Space Ranger actually do?
He's not a Space Ranger! He doesn't fight evil or... or shoot lasers or fly!
Excuse me.
- Wow!
- Oh, impressive wingspan. Very good!
Oh, what? What? These are plastic.
He can't fly.
They are a terillium-carbonic alloy, and I can fly.
- No, you can't.
- Yes, I can.
- You can't.
- Can.
Can't. Can't. Can't!
I tell you, I could fly around this room with my eyes closed!
Okay, then, Mr. Light Beer, prove it.
All right, then, I will.
Stand back, everyone.
To infinity and beyond!
- Can!
- Whoa!
Oh, wow! You flew magnificently!
- I found my movin' buddy.
- Thank you. Th-Thank you all. Thank you.
That wasn't flying.
That was falling with style.
Man, the dolls must really go for you.
Can you teach me that?
- Golly bob howdy!
- Oh, shut up!
No, in a couple of days, everything will be just the way it was. They'll see.
They'll see. I'm still
Andy's favorite toy.
# I was on top of the world #
# livin' high #
# It was right in my pocket #
Whoa!
# I was livin'the life #
# Things were just the way they should be #
# When from out of the sky like a bomb #
# Comes some little punk in a rocket #
# Now all of a sudden some strange things are happening to me #
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!
# Strange things #
# Are happening to me #
# Strange things #
# Strange things #
# Are happening to me #
# Ain't no doubt about it #
# I had friends
I had lots of friends #
# Now all my friends are gone #
# And I'm doin' the best I can #
# To carry on #
# I had power #
# Power #
# I was respected #
# Respected #
# But not anymore #
# And I've lost the love of the one #
# Whom I adore #
# Let me tell you 'bout it
Strange things #
# Are happening to me #
# Strange things #
# Strange things #
# Are happening to me #
# Ain't no doubt about it #
# Strange things #
# Strange things #
Oh! Finally.
- Hey, who's got my hat?
- Look, I'm Woody. Howdy, howdy, howdy.
Ah-ha. Ah-ha!
Give me that!
Say there, Lizard and Stretchy Dog, let me show you something.
It looks as though I've been accepted into your culture.
Your chief, Andy, inscribed his name on me.
Wow! With permanent ink too!
Well, I must get back to repairing my ship.
- Don't let it get to you, Woody.
- Uh, let what?
I don't, uh...
What do you mean? Who?
I know Andy's excited about Buzz, but you know he'll always have a special place for you.
- Yeah, like the attic.
- All right! That's it!
- Unidirectional bonding strip.
- Mr. Lightyear wants more tape.
Listen, Light Snack, you stay away from Andy.
He's mine, and no one is taking him away from me.
What are you talking about?
Where's that bonding strip?
And another thing:
Stop with this spaceman thing!
It's getting on my nerves!
Are you saying you want to lodge a complaint with Star Command?
Oh-ho-ho! Okay! Ooh, well, so you wanna do it the hard way, huh?
- Don't even think about it, cowboy.
- Oh, yeah, tough guy?
The air isn't toxic.
How dare you open a spaceman's helmet on an uncharted planet!
My eyeballs could've been sucked from their sockets.
You actually think you're The Buzz Lightyear?
Oh, all this time
I thought it was an act!
Hey, guys, look!
It's the real Buzz Lightyear!
- You're mocking me, aren't you?
- Oh, no, no. No, no, no, no, no.
- Buzz, look! An alien!
- Where?
Yes!
Whoa!
- Uh-oh.
- It's Sid!
- Don't move!
- I thought he was at summer camp.
They, uh, must have kicked him out early this year.
Oh, no, not Sid!
Incoming!
- Who is it this time?
- Uh, I can't... I can't tell.
- Hey, where's Lenny?
- Right here, Woody.
Oh, no, I can't bear to watch one of these again.
- Stay where you are!
- Oh, no, it's a Combat Carl.
- What's going on?
- Nothing that concerns you spacemen
Just us toys.
I'd better take a look anyway.
Why is that soldier strapped to an explosive device?
That's why... Sid.
- Hmm, sure is a hairy fellow.
- No, no, that's Scud, you idiot.
That is Sid.
- You mean that happy child?
- That ain't no happy child.
He tortures toys, just for fun!
Well, then, we've got to do something.
- What are you doing?
- Get down from there!
I'm gonna teach that boy a lesson.
Yeah, sure. You go ahead.
Melt him with your scary laser.
Be careful with that.
It's extremely dangerous.
He's lighting it!
He's lighting it! Hit the dirt!
Look out!
Yes! He's gone!
He's history!
I could've stopped him.
Buzz, I would love to see you try.
- Of course, I'd love to see you as a crater.
- Yeah!
- The sooner we move, the better.
- Oh, what a great shot. Yeah!
To infinity and beyond!
Oh, all this packing makes me hungry.
What would you say to dinner at, uh, oh, Pizza Planet?
Pizza Planet? Oh, cool!
Go wash your hands, and I'll get Molly ready.
- Can I bring some toys?
- You can bring one toy.
- Just one?
- One toy?
Will Andy pick me?
"Don't count on it"?
Ohh!
Buzz! Oh, Buzz!
Buzz Lightyear!
Buzz Lightyear, thank goodness!
We've got trouble!
- Trouble? Where?
- Down there. Just down there.
A helpless toy!
It's... It's trapped, Buzz!
Then we've no time to lose.
- I don't see anything.
- Uh, he's there.
Just... Just keep looking.
What kind of toy...
- Buzz!
- Buzz!
Buzz!
- I don't see him in the driveway.
- Did you see what happened?
- I think he bounced into Sid's yard!
- Ohh! Buzz!
Hey, everyone! R.C.'s trying to say something. What is it, boy?
- He's saying that this was no accident.
- Huh?
- What do you mean?
- I mean Humpty-Dumpty was pushed.
- No!
- By Woody!
- What?
- What?
Wait a minute.
You... You don't think
I meant to knock Buzz out the window,
Do you?
Potato Head?
That's Mr. Potato Head to you, you back-stabbin' murderer!
Now, it was an accident, guys.
Come on.
Now, you... you gotta believe me.
We believe ya, Woody.
Right, Rex?
Well, ye... n...
I don't like confrontations.
Where is your honor, dirt bag?
You are an absolute disgrace!
You don't deserve to... Hey!
You couldn't handle Buzz cuttin' in on your playtime, could you, Woody?
Didn't wanna face the fact that Buzz just might be Andy's new favorite toy.
So you got rid of him.
Well, what if Andy starts playing with me more, Woody, huh?
You're gonna knock me out of the window too?
- I don't think we should give him the chance.
- There he is, men.
- Frag him!
- Let's string him up by his pull string!
- I've got dibs on his hat!
- Would you boys stop it?
- Tackle him!
- No, no, no! W-W-Wait!
Boys, stop it!
- I can explain everything.
- Okay, Mom, be right down.
- I've gotta get Buzz.
- Retreat!
- Mom, do you know where Buzz is?
- No, I haven't seen him.
Psst!
Andy, I'm heading out the door!
- But, Mom, I can't find him!
- Honey, just grab some other toy.
Now, come on.
Okay.
I couldn't find my Buzz.
I know I left him right there.
Honey, I'm sure he's around.
You'll find him.
It's too short!
We need more monkeys!
There aren't any more!
That's the whole barrel!
Buzz, the monkeys aren't working.
We're formulating another plan!
Stay calm!
Oh, where could he be?
- Can I help pump the gas?
- Sure! I'll even let you drive.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, when you're 16.
Yuk, yuk, yuk.
Funny, Mom.
Oh, great. How am I gonna convince those guys it was an accident?
Buzz!
Buzz! Hah! You're alive!
This is great! Oh, I'm saved!
I'm saved! Andy will find you here.
He'll take us back to the room, and then you can tell everyone... that this was all just a big mistake.
Huh? Right? Buddy?
I just want you to know that even though you tried to terminate me, revenge is not an idea we promote on my planet.
- Oh. Oh, that's good.
- But we're not on my planet.
- Are we?
- No.
Okay. Come on!
You want a piece of me?
Ow!
Buzz... Buzz... Buzz
Lightyear to the rescue.
- Ouch!
- Next stop...
- Pizza Planet. Yeah!
Andy!
Wh... Doesn't he realize that I'm not there?
I'm lost!
Oh, I'm a lost toy!
Buzz Lightyear mission log.
The local sheriff and I seem to be at a huge refueling station of some sort.
You!
- According to my navi-computer, the...
- Shut up!
- Just shut up, you idiot!
- Sheriff, this is no time to panic.
This is the perfect time to panic!
I'm lost! Andy is gone!
They're gonna move from their house in two days, and it's all your fault!
My... My fault? If you hadn't pushed me out of the window in the first place...
Oh, yeah? Well, if you hadn't shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship... and taken away everything that was important to me...
Don't talk to me about importance.
Because of you, the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy!
What? What are you talking about?
Right now, poised at the edge of the galaxy,
Emperor Zurg has been secretly building... a weapon with the destructive capacity to annihilate an entire planet!
I alone have information that reveals this weapon's only weakness.
And you, my friend, are responsible for delaying my rendezvous with Star Command!
You are a toy!
You aren't the real Buzz Lightyear!
You're a... Uh, you're an action figure!
You are a child's plaything!
You are a sad, strange little man, and you have my pity. Farewell.
Oh, yeah? Well, good riddance, ya loony.
"Rendezvous with Star Command."
- Hey, gas dude!
- You talking to me?
- Pizza Planet?
- Yeah, man. Can you help me?
- D'you know where Cutting Boulevard is?
- Andy!
- Just a moment.
- Oh, no!
I can't show my face in that room without Buzz.
- Buzz! Buzz, come back!
- Go away.
No, Buzz, you gotta come back! l...
I found a spaceship!
It's a spaceship, Buzz.
Come on, man, hurry up! Um, like, the pizzas are getting cold here.
- Oh, yeah, Cutting Boulevard.
- Yeah, yeah. Which way?
Now, you're sure this space freighter will return... to its port of origin once it jettisons its food supply?
Uh-huh. And when we get there, we'll be able to find a way to transport you home.
- Well, then, let's climb aboard.
- No, no, no, wait! Buzz! Buzz!
Let's get in the back.
No one will see us there.
Negative. There are no restraining harnesses in the cargo area.
- We'll be much safer in the cockpit.
- Yeah, but...
- Buzz! Buzz!
- That's two lefts and a right, huh?
- Yeah.
- Uh, thanks for the directions, okay?
- Yeah, remember, kid...
- Buzz!
"It's safer in the cockpit than the cargo bay." What an idiot.
Next shuttle lift off scheduled for T-minus 30 minutes and counting.
You are cleared to enter.
Welcome to Pizza Planet.
The white zone is for eating pizza...
- Sheriff!
Sheriff? There you are.
Now, the entrance is heavily guarded.
We need a way to get inside.
Great idea, Woody.
I like your thinkin'.
You are cleared to enter.
- Welcome to Pizza Planet.
- Now!
Quickly, Sheriff!
The air lock is closing.
Jones, party of five, your shuttle is now boarding...
Mom, can we have some tokens?
- Ow! Watch where you're going!
- Sorry!
Nine, Eight, Seven, Six,
Five, Four, Three,
Two, One.
What a spaceport!
Good work, Woody.
- Mom, can I play Black Hole?
Please, please, please!
- Andy!
- Oh, it's so cool!
Now, we need to find a ship that's headed for Sector 12.
Wait a minute. No, no, no, Buzz.
This way! There's a special ship. I just saw it.
You mean it has hyperdrive?
Hyperactive hyperdrive and Astro, uh, turf!
- Where is it? l-I don't see the...
- Come on. That's it.
Spaceship!
All right, Buzz, get ready. And...
Until the universe explodes!
Okay, Buzz, when I say go, we're gonna jump in the basket.
Buzz!
- Hey, Mom, if I eat all of my pizza,
- No!
Can I have some alien slime?
This cannot be happening to me!
- A stranger.
- From the outside. Ooh!
Greetings.
I am Buzz Lightyear.
- I come in peace.
- Tell me what it's like outside.
Before your space journey, re-energize yourself with a slice of pepperoni,
now boarding at counter three.
This is an intergalactic emergency.
I need to commandeer your vessel to Sector 12.
Who's in charge here?
The claw!
The claw is our master.
- The claw chooses who will go and who will stay.
- This is ludicrous.
- Hey, bozo, you got a brain in there?
Take that!
Oh, no! Sid!
Get down!
- What's gotten into you, Sheriff? I wa...
- You are the one...
- That decided to climb into this...
- Shh! The claw.
It moves.
I have been chosen!
Farewell, my friends.
I go on to a better place.
Gotcha!
A Buzz Lightyear?
No way!
- Yes!
- Buzz! No!
Hey!
- He has been chosen.
- He must go. Hey!
- You might anger the claw.
- What are you doing? Stop it!
- The claw! The claw!
- Stop it, you zealots!
- Do not fight the claw.
All right!
Double prizes!
Let's go home and play.
Sheriff, I can see your dwelling from here. You're almost home.
Nirvana is coming.
The mystic portal awaits.
Will you be quiet?
You guys don't get it, do you?
Once we go into Sid's house, we won't be coming out!
Whoa, Scud! Hey, boy!
Sit! Good boy.
- Hey, I got something for you, boy.
- Freeze!
Ready, set, now!
Hannah! Hey, Hannah!
- What?
- Did I get my package in the mail?
- I don't know.
- What do you mean, you don't know?
I don't know.
- Oh, no, Hannah!
- What?
Look... Janie!
Hey!
- She's sick!
- No, she's not!
- I'll have to perform one of my operations.
- No!
- Not Sid's room. Not there.
- No!
Sid, give her back!
Sid!
- Oh, no! - Mom!
- We have a sick patient here, Nurse.
Prepare the O.R., stat!
Patient is prepped.
No one's ever attempted a double bypass... brain transplant before.
Now for the tricky part.
Pliers!
I don't believe that man's ever been to medical school.
Doctor, you've done it!
Hannah!
Janie's all better now.
- Mom! Mom!
- She's lying!
Whatever she says, it's not true!
We are gonna die.
I'm outta here!
Locked!
There's gotta be another way outta here.
Uh, Buzz, was that you?
Hey, hi there, little fella.
Come out here.
Do you know a way outta here?
Bu-Bu-Bu-Buzz!
They're cannibals.
Mayday, mayday. Come in,
Star Command. Send reinforcements.
Star Command, do you copy?
I've set my laser from stun to kill.
Ah, great, great. Yeah, and if anyone attacks us, we can blink 'em to death.
Hey, you guys, I think
I found him. Buzz, is that you?
Whiskers, will you get out of here!
You're interfering with a search and rescue!
Look! They're home.
- Mom, have you seen Woody?
- Where was the last place you left him?
- Right here in the van.
- I'm sure he's there.
You're just not looking hard enough.
He's not here, Mom.
Woody's gone!
- Woody's gone?
- Yeah, boy, the weasel ran away.
Huh? Huh?
I told you he was guilty.
Who would've thought he was capable of such atrocities?
Oh, Slink,
I hope he's okay.
Oh, a survivor!
Where's the rebel base?
Talk!
I can see your will is strong.
Well, we have ways of making you talk.
Where are your rebel friends now?
- Sid, your Pop Tarts are ready!
- All right!
Are you all right?
I'm proud of you, Sheriff.
A lesser man would've talked under such torture.
I sure hope this isn't permanent.
Still no word from Star Command.
We're not that far from the spaceport.
The door. It's open!
We're free!
- Woody, we don't know what's out there!
- I'll tell you wha...
They're gonna eat us, Buzz!
Do something, quick!
Shield your eyes!
It's not working. I recharged it before I left. l-It should be good for...
You idiot, you're a toy!
Use your karate-chop action!
Get away!
Hey! Hey! How're you doin' that?
Stop that!
- Back! Back, you savages! Back!
- Woody, stop it.
Sorry, guys, but dinner's cancelled.
There's no place like home.
There's no place like home.
There's no place like home!
Another stunt like that, cowboy, and you're gonna get us killed.
- Don't tell me what to do.
- Shh!
Yee-haw! Giddyap, partner!
We got to get this wagon train a-movin'!
Split up!
Calling Buzz Lightyear. Come in,
Buzz Lightyear. This is Star Command.
- Buzz Lightyear, Star Command!
- do you read me?
Buzz Lightyear responding.
Read you loud and clear.
Buzz Lightyear, planet Earth needs your help!
- On the way!
- Buzz Lightyear!
The world's greatest superhero, now the world's greatest toy!
Buzz has it all!
Locking wrist communicator!
- Calling Buzz Lightyear!
- Karate-chop action!
- Wow!
- Pulsating laser light!
- Total annihilation!
- Multi-phrase voice simulator!

Mom! Mom, have you seen my Sally doll?
What, dear?
What was that?
Never mind!
Buzz, the coast is clear.
Buzz, where are you?
 There's a secret mission in uncharted space. Let's go.
Really? That is so interesting.
Would you like some tea,
Mrs. Nesbitt?
Buzz!
It's so nice you could join us on such late notice.
- Oh, no.
- What a lovely hat, Mrs. Nesbitt.
It goes quite well with your head.
Hannah! Oh, Hannah!
Mom? Please excuse me, ladies.
I'll be right back.
What is it, Mom?
Mom, where are you?
Buzz! Hey! Buzz, are you okay?
Gone! It's all gone.
All of it's gone.
Bye-bye. Whoo-whoo. See ya.
- What happened to you?
- One minute you're defending the whole galaxy, and suddenly you find yourself suckin' down Darjeeling... with Marie Antoinette and her little sister.
I think you've had enough tea for today.
- Let's get you outta here, Buzz.
- Don't you get it?
You see the hat?
I am Mrs. Nesbitt!
Snap out of it, Buzz! l-l-I'm... I'm sorry, l...
You're right.
I am just a little depressed, that's all. l... l-I can get through this.
- Oh, I'm a sham!
- Shh!
- Look at me.
- Quiet, Buzz!
I can't even fly out of a window.
But the hat looked good?
Tell me the hat looked good.
- The apron is a bit much.
- Out the window!
Buzz, you're a genius!
Come on, come on. This way.
Years of academy training wasted!
- B-3.
- Miss! G-6.
Ohh! You sunk it!
- Are you peeking?
- Oh, quit your whining and pay up.
No, no, not the ear.
Give me the nose. Come on.
How about three out of five?
Hey, guys! Guys!
- Hey!
- Son of a building block!
- It's Woody.
- He's in the psycho's bedroom.
- H-H-Hi!
- Everyone! It's Woody!
- Woody?
- You're kidding!
Woody!
We're gonna get out of here, Buzz.
Buzz?
- Hey, look!
- Woody!
Oh, boy, am I glad to see you guys!
- I knew you'd come back, Woody!
- What are you doin' over there?
It's a long story, Bo.
I'll explain later.
Here! Catch this!
Whoa! I got it, Woody!
- He got it, Woody!
- Good goin', Slink!
- Now just, just tie it on to somethin'.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
- I got a better idea.
How about we don't?
Hey!
- Potato Head!
- Did you all take stupid pills this morning?
Have you forgotten what he did to Buzz?
And now you want to let him back over here?
No! No, no. No, no, no, no, no.
You got it...
You got it all wrong,
Potato Head.
Buzz is fine. Buzz is right here. He's with me.
- You are a liar!
- No, I'm not!
Buzz, come over here and j-just tell the nice toys that you're... that you're not dead.
Just a sec! Buzz, will you get up here and give me a hand?
That's very funny, Buzz.
This is serious!
Hey, Woody, where'd ya go?
He's lying. Buzz ain't there.
Oh, hi, Buzz. Why don't you say hello to the guys over there?
Hiya, fellas!
To infinity and beyond!
Hey, look! It's Buzz!
Yeah! Hey, Buzz, let's show the guys our new secret best-friends handshake.
- Give me five, man!
- Something's screwy here.
So you see, we're friends now, guys. Aren't we, Buzz?
You bet. Give me a hug.
- Oh, I love you too.
- See? It is Buzz.
- Now give back the lights, Potato Head.
- Wait just a minute.
- What are you tryin' to pull?
- Nothin'.
- Oh, that is disgusting.
- Murderer!
- No! No, no, no, no, no!
- You murdering dog!
- It's not what you think, I swear!
- Save it for the jury!
I hope Sid pulls your voice box out, you creep.
No! No! No, no! Don't leave!
Don't leave! Y-Ya gotta help us, please!
- You don't know what it's like over here!
- Come on, let's get out of here.
Go back to your lives, citizens.
Show's over.
Come back! Slink!
Slink, please!
Please listen to me!
No! No, come back!
Slinky!
Buzz!
Go away, you disgusting freaks!
All right, back!
Back, you cannibals!
He is still alive and you're... you're not gonna get him, you monsters!
What are you doin'?
Hey. Hey, they fixed you.
But... But they're cannibals.
We saw them eat those other toys.
Uh, sorry. l-l-I thought that you were gonna, you kn... you know, eat my friend.
Hey, no, no. Hey. Hey!
What's wrong?
- Sid!
- Not now, Mom! I'm busy!
Sid!
Buzz, come on, get up!
Use your legs!
Fine! Let Sid trash you!
But don't blame me!
It came! It finally came!
"The Big One."
"Extremely dangerous.
Keep out of reach of children."
Cool! What am I gonna blow?
Man! Hey, where's that wimpy cowboy doll?
Yes.
I've always wanted to put a spaceman into orbit.
Yes.
Oh, no!
Oh, man!
Sid Phillips reporting.
Launch of the shuttle has been delayed due to adverse weather conditions at the launch site.
Tomorrow's forecast? Sunny.
Sweet dreams.
I looked everywhere, honey, but all I could find was your hat.
W-What if we leave them behind?
Oh, don't worry, honey.
I'm sure we'll find Woody and
Buzz before we leave tomorrow.
- I need air.
- Will you quit moving around?
I'm sorry. It's just that I get...
I get so nervous before I travel.
How did I get stuck with you as a moving buddy?
Everyone else was picked.
Oh, Woody.
If only you could see how much Andy misses you.
Psst! Psst! Hey, Buzz!
Hey. Get over here and see if you can get this tool box off me.
Oh, come on, Buzz, l...
Buzz, I can't do this without you.
I need your help.
I can't help.
I can't help anyone.
Why, sure you can, Buzz.
You can get me out of here.
And then I'll get that rocket off you and we'll make a break for Andy's house.
Andy's house, Sid's house.
What's the difference?
Oh, Buzz, you've had a big fall.
Y-You must not be thinking clearly.
No, Woody, for the first time
I am thinking clearly.
You were right all along.
I'm not a Space Ranger.
I'm just a toy.
A stupid little insignificant toy.
Whoa. Hey.
Wait a minute.
Being a toy is a lot better than being a, a Space Ranger.
- Yeah, right.
- No, it is.
Look, over in that house is a kid who thinks you are the greatest, and it's not because you're a Space Ranger, pal.
It's because you're a toy.
You are his toy.
- But why would Andy want me?
- Why would Andy want you?
Look at you!
You're a Buzz Lightyear!
Any other toy would give up his moving parts just to be you.
You've got wings!
You glow in the dark! You talk!
Your helmet does that... that... that "whoosh" thing.
You are a cool toy.
As a matter of fact, you're too cool.
I mean... I mean, what chance does a toy like me have... against a Buzz Lightyear action figure?
All I can do is...
There's a snake in my boots!
Why would Andy ever want to play with me when he's got you?
I'm the one that should be strapped to that rocket.
Listen, Buzz, forget about me. You should get out of here while you can.
- Buzz, what are you doin'? I thought you...
- Come on, Sheriff.
There's a kid over in that house who needs us.
Now let's get you out of this thing.
- Hit it!
- Yes, sir!
Come on, Buzz, we can do it.
- Woody! It's the moving van!
- We gotta get out of here now.
Come on, Buzz.
All right.
- Buzz. Hey, I'm out!
- Almost there.
I wanna ride the pony.
Whew.
Woody. Woody, are you all right?
No, I'm fine. I'm okay.
Oh, yeah!
Time for liftoff! Whoo!
To infinity and beyond!
Whoo-hoo!
Back! Back!
Down! Down!
Okay, what do I do?
Come on, Woody, think.
Guys!
No, no, no, no, wait!
Wait. Listen. Please!
There's a good toy down there and he's... he's gonna be blown to bits in a few minutes, all because of me.
We gotta save him.
But I need your help.
Please. He's my friend.
He's the only one I've got.
Thank you.
Okay, I think I know what to do.
We're going to have to break a few rules, but if it works it'll help everybody.
Houston to Mission Control.
Come in, Control.
Launchpad is being constructed.
All right, listen up.
I need Pump Boy here.
Ducky, here. Legs?
You're with Ducky.
RollerBob and I don't move
'til we get the signal. Clear?
Okay. Let's move!
Wind the frog!
Wait for the signal.
Go!
All right, let's go!
I'll get it!
Now!
I'm coming, I'm coming.
Whoa! Scud!
Stupid dog.
Lean back!
Uh, Mission Control, is the launchpad construction complete?
Uh, roger. Rocket is now secured to guide wire.
We are currently obtaining the ignition sticks.
Countdown will commence momentarily.
Stand by.
Let's go.
Hey, Mom!
Where are the matches?
- Oh, wait, here they are. Never mind!
- Woody! Great!
- Help me out of this thing.
- Shh!
- What?
- It's okay. Everything's under control.
- Woody, what are you doing?
- Houston, all systems are go.
Requesting permission to launch.
Hey. How'd you get out here?
Oh, well. You and I can have a cookout later.
Houston, do we have permission to launch?
Uh, roger. Permission granted.
You are confirmed at T-minus ten seconds... and counting.
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one...
Reach for the sky.
- Huh?
- This town ain't big enough for the two of us.
What?
Somebody's poisoned the water hole.
- It's busted.
- Who are you calling "busted,"buster?
- Huh?
- That's right.
- I'm talking to you, Sid Phillips.
- Huh?
We don't like bein' blown up, Sid.
- Or smashed. Or ripped apart.
- We?
That's right. Your toys.
Mama! Mama!
Mama! Mama!
Mama!
From now on you must take good care of your toys,
because if you don't, we'll find out, Sid.
We toys can see everything.
So play nice.
We did it! We did it! Yes!
The toys! The toys are alive!
N-Nice toy.
What's wrong, Sid? Don't you want to play with Sally?
Nice work, fellas. Good job.
Coming out of the ground... what a touch.
That was a stroke of genius.
Woody.
Thanks.
Everybody say, "Bye, House!"
- Woody! The van!
- Bye, House.
We gotta run! Thanks, guys!
Quick!
Just go! I'll catch up!
Come on!
You can do it, Woody!
I made it.
Ow! Get away, you stupid dog!
Down! Down!
Hold on, Woody!
I can't do it.
Take care of Andy for me!
No!
Buzz!
- Ow!
- Are we there already?
- Woody?
- Woody!
- How did you...
- How'd he get here?
- Where have you... What happened... Ow!
- What's goin' on?
- What's the... What's he takin'?
- Aha! There you are!
Hey, what's he doing?
He's at it again!
- Get him!
- Come on!
Get him!
Aah! Aah! No! No!
No, no, no, no, wait! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Pig pile!
- Get out of that car!
- Move it!
- Whew.
- No, please! You don't understand!
Buzz is out there!
We gotta help him!
- Toss him overboard!
- No, no, no, no! Wait! Aaah!
- Hooray!
- So long, Woody!
- Ohh, Woody!
- Ohh!
- Oh! Well, thanks for the ride!
- Look out! Aaaah!
Now let's catch up to that truck!
- Guys! Guys! Woody's riding R.C.!
- What?
And Buzz is with him!
- Ohh!
- What? Buzz?
It is Buzz!
Woody was telling the truth!
- What have we done?
- Great! Now I have guilt!
We're almost there!
- Rocky, the ramp!
- Come on, Woody, Buzz! You can do it!
Look out!
Quick! Hold on to my tail!
Atta boy, Slink!
Uhh! Woody!
- Woody, speed up!
- Speed up!
The batteries!
They're running out!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Whoa!
- Aaaah!
# Hakuna Matata
# What a wonderful phrase
I can't hold on much longer!
Slink, hang on!
Ouch!
Great.
- Woody! The rocket!
- The match!
Yes! Thank you, Sid!
No! No, no! No!
No!
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
No!
- Woody, what are you doing?
- Hold still, Buzz.
You did it! Next stop, Andy.
Wait a minute.
I just lit a rocket.
Rockets explode!
I should've held on longer.
Look! Look! It's Woody and Buzz coming up fast!
Woody!
Run! Take cover!
Aah! This is the part where we blow up!
Not today.
Hey, Buzz! You're flying!
This isn't flying.
This is falling with style.
To infinity and beyond!
Uh, Buzz, we missed the truck.
We're not aiming for the truck.
- Hey! Wow!
- What? What is it?
Woody!
Buzz!
Oh, great! You found 'em.
Where were they?
- Here in the car!
- See?
Now, what did I tell you?
Right where you left 'em.
- Which one can I open first?
- Let's let Molly open one.
- Frankincense, this is Myrrh.
- Hey, heads up, everybody!
- It's show time!
- Oh! It's time!
Oh. Bo. There's gotta be a less painful way to get my attention.
Merry Christmas, Sheriff.
- Say, isn't that mistletoe?
- Mm-hmm.
Maybe Andy'll get another dinosaur, like a leaf eater.
That way I could play the, uh, dominant predator!
- Quiet, everyone, quiet.
- Molly's first present is...
Mrs. Potato Head!
Repeat, a Mrs. Potato Head!
- Way to go, Idaho!
- Gee, I'd better shave.
Come in, Frankincense. Andy is now opening his first present. It's...
- Buzz. Buzz Lightyear.
- I can't quite...
- You are not worried, are you?
- Me? No.
- make out...
- No. No, no, no, no, no, no. Mm-mmm.
A large box.
It's, it's, it's...
- Are you?
- Oh, now, Buzz.
What could Andy possibly get that is worse than you?
Oh, what is it? What is it?
Wow! A puppy!
# You've got a friend in me #
# You've got a friend in me #
# When the road looks rough ahead #
# And you're miles and miles from your nice, warm bed #
# You just remember what your old pal said #
# Boy, you've got a friend in me #
# Yeah, you've got a friend in me #
# You've got a friend in me #
# You've got a friend in me #
# If you got troubles #
# Then I got 'em too #
# There isn't anything
I wouldn't do for you #
# If we stick together we can see it through #
# 'Cause you've got a friend in me #
# You've got a friend in me #
# Now, some other folks might be a little bit smarter than I am #
# Bigger and stronger too #
# Maybe #
# But none of them will ever love you the way I do #
# It's me and you, boy #
# And as the years go by #

Ooh! ln all my years, never have I seen the streets... so full of bustle and hustle and assorted commotion.
Our princess is to wed.
Ohh, wonderful!
And who's the lucky prince?
Not a prince at all.
Just a no-account street rat!
No way! Try it phonetically.
It's Aladdin!
Aw! Some of you don't believe.
In colour!
There's a party here in Agrabah
There's excitement in the air
People pouring in from near and far
'Cause Jasmine and Aladdin are gonna have a weddin'
There's a party here in Agrabah
Everybody will be there
So if you're a pauper or a shah
Do somethin' with your hair
You mustn't wear an outfit that's naughty
A turban that's unravelling just won't do
No earrings that are tasteless or gaudy
You're gonna look gorgeous when I get through
There's a party here in Agrabah
So I'm going to paint the town
If you want to see what colours are
Follow me around
Aladdin's gettin' married and it's gonna be the wedding of the century
My buddy's gettin' married and you're gonna see just how much I can do
- You've heard of your safari bar mitzvahs
- Wow!
- You've all been to a luau sweet 16
- Ahh!
Well, none of them compare to what this is
The food'll be disgusting
By evening you'll be busting
There's a party here in Agrabah and it's got us all aglow
If a street rat could've come so far
Maybe I could do it
- Sure, there's nothing to it
- There's a party here in Agrabah
But we're not sure that we'll go
For although the bride is la-di-dah
The groom is awfully low
And now we take you down to the palace, where everyone has celebrated all night long.
Without Jafar and all of his malice
Everybody's happy
What could possibly go wrong?
There's a party here in Agrabah and we're gonna rob 'em blind
While they're all munching caviar create a small disturbance
I will sneak up from behind
There's a party here in Agrabah and the loot is pouring in
I like this wedding stuff so far
Maybe if I'm pleasant
I'll get to keep a present
We've ordered just a few tasteful flowers
And valets who'll carefully park for you
The bridesmaids have been dressing for hours
Girls, you look just lovely
And so grown-up too
There's a party here in Agrabah
Guests are filling up the room
But there's something missing
Yes, aha
Where is the groom
Hello.
Somebody's gonna be late for his own wedding!
Hold on, Genie.
There's something I need.
I gotcha.
It's a bachelor party, big boy!
- None for you.
You're the designated flyer.
- No.
This is for the wedding.
Well, that's, uh-- that's a nice dagger.
Interesting nuptial accessory.
It's a, uh, a bit sharp.
- It belonged to my father.
- Your father?
You never said a word about your father.
Oh, I've got to let the caterer know!
Chicken or sea bass?
He's not coming to the wedding.
He died a long time ago.
- Sorry.
- That's okay.
I never knew him.
Maybe if I did,
I'd feel ready for this.
Al, are you getting cold feet?
No, Genie. It's just that...
I-l've always been a street rat, stealin' what I need to survive,
- runnin' from the guards,
- Uh-huh.
- Iivin' my life alone.
- Ohh.
I'm takin' a big step today into a new world.
Today's topic: fears of the future family man.
AI from Agrabah, share with us.
I never had a father to show me how to raise a family.
No role model.
Get a little deeper.
What do I know about families?
Genie, what if
I'm no good at it?
Ah, if my father were here--
Al, little buddy, if your father were here, he'd be as proud of you as I am.
I just wish he could see this.
There's a party here in Agrabah
And the party's all for me
Just look, you guys at where we are
And how our dreams have come to be
There's a party here in Agrabah and I can't believe it's true
After all this waiting here we are
We'll finally get to say
"I do"
I never, ever had a real family
I never, ever had a real, true friend
Someone who could just understand me
Hey, come on, Aladdin!
This mush has gotta end!
There's a party here in Agrabah and it's starting right away
Let's get ya dressed
'cause you're the star
Hey, come on
It's your wedding day
Aladdin's gettin' married and it's gonna be
The wedding of the century
Amazing how Aladdin could've come so far
- They're finally getting married!
- They're finally getting married!
- They're finally getting married!
- Look at all these presents!
We're finally getting married.
- I'm finally gettin' married!
- They're finally gettin' married!
At the party in Agrabah
There's a party in Agrabah
A party goin' on now! Gotta party! Gotta party! Help me!
I can't stop myself!
Somebody rub the lamp!
Somebody rub the lamp!
Ah, you know I feel it!
That's enough.
Why do you walk in the open while I suffocate like an animal?
Someone has to keep a cool head, Sa'luk.
Someone will have no head if this is another wild goose chase.
The oracle is the real thing.
This time I'm sure.
Hello, and welcome to Lifestyles of the Rich and Magical.
That's right. We're taking you to the marriage of the millennium.
And who's this coming on the lovely stretch camel?
Oh, it's Cleopatra and Caesar, and they're bringing a salad.
How wonderful!
Oh, look, there's Osiris.
Oh, Osiris!
Osiris, can we have a word with you?
Oh, no, the crowd is parting.
Who's coming? It's Moses!
- And your name is?
- I'm Thor.
- You're Thor?
- Well, it hurts.
Once again, this whole broadcast has been brought to you by sand!
It's everywhere. Get used to it.
Come on. Come on.
I can see fine from back here.
Uh-uh. It's Aladdin.
Look, there's one thing
I get sentimental about... and I'm sittin' on it.
- Huh?
- The loot, monkey. The loot.
Bad news, Al. The boutonnieres clash with the cummerbunds.
Genie, isn't it a little late for that?
What? What are you trying to say? Out with it! What? What?
They're here.
Oh, no!
I'm late, I'm late for a very important date.
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.
- Your Highness.
Your Majesty.
D-Don't look so solemn, boy.
This is a happy day.
Oh, look. It's a Kodiak moment.
Put that bear outta here.
Ohh! Hmm.
- Wow!
- Oh, yeah!
I never thought this day would come.
Now I'm afraid that it has come all too soon.
Oh, Father.
- You distract the guards.
- Part of your plan?
A large part.
It's time.
It's all so magical.
I'm not gonna cry. I'm not.
Oh, sorry.
- Well, we're here.
- Together forever.
Let me be the point man.
I thought the earth wasn't supposed to move until the honeymoon.
Whoa! Oh, my word!
Stampede!
What is going on here?
Come here, monkey boy!
You were almost Dumbo toe jam.
Oh, they trampled the carpet!
That's a little redundant.
So this isn't a bad day for you, really, is it?
It is an attack.
Not in this palace!
I think we're gonna have a little problem with leaks.
It must be here somewhere.
Meet your match, Zorro!
Good birdie.
Polly want a little--
Say "cracker" and I'll let you have it on principle!
- You have a lot of spirit.
- Ow! Ow! Ow!
And a lot of mouth.
- They fight like demons.
- Worse than demons.
- These are the Forty Thieves.
- Really? I get 39.
Forty.
Where is it?
Ah, at last.
- Can I see your invitation?
- Stay out of my way, boy, and you won't get hurt!
Fool! You don't stand a chance against the King of Thieves!
When I get up, I'll bow to you!
Mmm. Huh? Ohh!
That was for ruining my wedding.
Huh? Aah!
I guess there's really no point to this now.
Freeze, sandbags!
Don't make me use the other end!
Mama always said,
"Magic is as magic does."
Cassim said nothing about facing the powers of a genie.
Get the others out of here.
We'll leave the "king" to his plans.
Where's the King of Thieves?
I'll see you again, boy.
Ooh! This is not my fault.
This was not built to code.
Good luck gettin' back the catering deposit.
- Oh, my!
- Fear not, O father of the bride.
- We can rebuild!
- Oh, please do.
We can't have a wedding without a pavilion.
All right, a wedding pavilion it is, my man.
Hey, I wanna see some resumés on these guys.
And don't let the one with the beak near any power tool.
Uh, yes, yes, Genie, whatever it takes.
I am sorry about all this, Jasmine.
Daughter?
What were they after, the gifts?
Not all the gifts. This is what the King of Thieves wanted.
With all the other great stuff, why go for this thing?
Your question is mine to answer.
The King of Thieves sought my sight to find the ultimate treasure.
- Did someone say "treasure"?
- Genie?
Oh, it looks like an oracle.
I see all that has been and all that will be.
Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Definitely an oracle. Tells the future. Uh-oh.
Girlfriend, where were you registered?
Okay, you know all, so tell all.
Where is the treasure?
You know, the ultimate one?
I am bound by the rule of one.
One question, one answer.
I only want one answer!
Where is the ultimate treasure?
You have already asked your one question.
You mean before?
Oh, that wasn't a question.
That was, uh, thinkin' out loud.
Very loud.
Aladdin, we could learn anything about our lives, our future.
You have but to ask.
I know what my future is.
My future is you.
But my past is a blank.
My mother died when I was just a kid, and I never even knew my father.
I have no idea where I come from.
Your question is your choice, but remember the rule of one.
Choose carefully.
Oh, sure, she warns him about the one question thing. Hey!
I don't think you can help me.
My past isn't just one question; it's a million questions.
Ah, but mere questions about your past can be answered by your father.
My father?
My father is alive?
Abu? Where's Aladdin?
How long has he been up there?
Aladdin?
Are you all right?
- What's wrong?
- I always wanted to know about my father, but just now I'm not so sure.
What kind of man leaves his son?
Did he even care?
- Maybe I don't want to know.
- Yes, you do.
How can you be so sure?
Because I already know him.
Because I know you.
You showed me the world
When I was all locked up inside
You reached out your hand
And took me on a magic carpet ride
One look at your smile
And I could see the light
Shining everywhere
People like you don't come out of thin air
Oh, Jasmine.
You don't understand
There is so much that you don't see
Just think if you can
What growing up had to be like for me
Your father's a man
Who taught you who you are
Mine was never there
So how can you say
I don't come out of thin air
There's so much I want to know
You've got the chance to learn
If it means I'd have to go
I'll be right here when you return
- Our wedding can wait
- I love you
- I think it's worth this small delay
- Maybe you're right
And won't it be great
To have your father see our wedding day
- I've waited so long to learn the truth
- It isn't too late
And now at last we can finally say
Your father is really there
There's so much that we might share
And you'll finally learn
- You don't come out of thin air
- Don't come out of thin air
- Have you chosen your question?
- I have.
Then ask.
Where is my father?
Follow the trail of the Forty Thieves.
Your father is trapped within their world.
The Forty Thieves? ls he hurt?
How long has he been their prisoner?
I'm sorry. I can only answer one question.
- It's up to me.
- Take as long as you need.
I'll be back in time for our wedding. I promise.
I should've stayed with the genie.
Manual labour beats danger any day.
Good. The trail's still fresh.
- Hyah! Hyah!
- Hyah!
- There.
Definitely should've stayed with the genie.
Shh.
Whew. Well, they have nowhere to go.
- We got 'em trapped.
- We?
They are 40 thieves.
We are you, a rug, a monkey and me.
- Wait, don't count me.
- They're just standing there.
Open sesame!
Hyah!
- Let's move!
- Oh, oh! Aah!
- Whoa!
- Hang on!
I know, Carpet.
It's incredible. Wha--
How bad is it?
Yeow!
Oh, this is attractive.
Come on.
Hey!
You wanna not hold up traffic?
I wanna get in, get out and go home.
Actually, I wouldn't mind skipping right to the "go home."
- We could've had all of the loot at the wedding,
- Shh! but we followed the King's plan.
This is what we have to show for our trouble in Agrabah.
- Nothing!
- Yeah! I agree.
- This oughta be good.
- Sa'luk is truly ticked.
Your time draws to a close, Cassim.
Cassim? My father.
If you're talking about spilling my blood, well, I just don't see that happening.
Then let me open your eyes.
- Huh?
- Run! I've got him.
I'm Aladdin. You're my father!
His father?
I don't know about your father, boy, but I'll send you to meet your other ancestors.
Let him go. The boy is my son.
I gave this dagger to my wife years ago.
I told her to give it to our newborn son, Aladdin.
It's true?
Oh, the boy is the son of the King of Thieves.
You are the King of Thieves?
Like it or not, boy, we are blood.
Look at you. I thought
I'd never see you again.
Has it been so long?
Blood or mud, the boy is an intruder, and we have rules about intruders.
- Sa'luk is right.
- He knows our secrets.
- I hate intruders.
- Hey, me too.
He has found our secret lair.
He has seen too much.
He must die.
Yes!
- They must all die.
- Die?
He's your son. I'm his friend.
Cast a vote for mercy here!
Yes, Cassim, mercy would be so like you.
Soft and weak.
- Maybe Sa'luk should be king.
- Maybe Sa'luk should be king.
- Yes, yes, he should be.
- Kill him.
- Huh?
Or the boy could--
Yes, the boy could-- No.
- What? What? Th-The boy could what?
- Speak.
- Nothing. Probably a bad idea.
- Let's hear it!
- No, no, no!
Well, it seems to me that--
Oh, never mind.
- What?
- Oh, no, please!
The boy could face the challenge.
- Ahh!
- Oh, that's right, the challenge!
That's that. My son shall face the challenge.
And I shall be the one to test him.
- Yeah!
- A test, huh? Ah, that's not so bad.
Maybe it'll be multiple choice.
Escape? Not likely.
Our ride home is grounded, and Al-- well, it's been nice knowin' him.
- What's going on, Dad?
- Oh, the challenge is simple enough.
Only one man survives.
But you're my son.
You'll be that man.
Knock him dead, kid. Seriously.
No!
I thought our side won!
- Look, l-- I-l didn't mean--
- Get him!
Take him to the King.
Look, I don't even know him, okay?
You killed Sa'luk. The code of the Forty
Thieves is very clear on this point.
- You're in.
- Hooray! Hooray!
- Congratulations, bub
- You've joined the club
And everybody here agrees
We got the finest blend of nearly-honest men
Welcome to the Forty Thieves
A fraternity of thugs that you can trust
There's nothing up our 80 sleeves
- Got lots of grub to share
- Pull up an easy chair
Welcome to the Forty Thieves
Now you get to lie and cheat
Never have to brush your teeth
But we always aim to please
- Care for one another
- You'll never miss your mother
Oh, I love you guys.
Schemin' up a scam out on the lam
Takin' whatever we please
- And if you like to lurk
- You're gonna love this work
Welcome to the Forty Thieves
Welcome to the Forty Thieves
Together we're the perfect team
Larceny is in the genes
Dare to share the family dream
Live a life of leisure
Countin' all your treasure
As an honorary member of the gang
That no one alive ever leaves
- You gotta snatch and sneak
- Or else your future's bleak
We got a lifetime contract that you're bound to keep
You wanna save your skin
You'd better fit right in
Well, well, welcome to the--
Well, well, welcome to the--
Forty
Thieves
Boy. And I thought I was blue.
You would know if Aladdin is in trouble, wouldn't you?
I thought he'd be back by now.
AI will be back.
Listen to Genie, dear.
Genie knows.
You've got to get your mind off this incessant waiting.
Here's a sure-fire way to cheer up a bummed-out bride-to-be.
A heaping helping of matrimonial magic.
Hey, that's-a no good.
What the wedding needs is a theme.
- It needs a groom too, but let's work with what we have.
- Genie!
It's a joke. I do that.
Okay, let's see. This'll be the second wedding for both of you.
I'm thinking we need something a little more simple, a little more elegant and less grey.
Did it, done it, own it.
I'm gonna throw some colours at ya-- mauve, teal and salmon.
What do you like besides the salmon? Okay, Madonna!
Don't keep it. Just put that in the mix. Wink. Okay.
I see lasers! It's a miracle!
He believes! He believes!
- Thank you very much.
- I don't think so.
Tres gauche, right?
Hmm, maybe you-- you could elope.
No, you "cantaloupe."
But oh, "honeydew"!
I don't know whether to put it under props or produce.
Please don't squeeze the tyres. They're not ripe. And how about that gown?
Whether you're dancing with dwarfs or simply biting the apple, it says,
"I'm a princess for now."
- Uh, Genie.
- Hey, it's synergy.
The marketing guys are very excited. It tests really well.
Thank you, Genie.
I'm sure it will be wonderful.
And thanks for cheering me up.
I'm sure Ali Baba and the boy are on the road to Agrabah right now. Isn't that right, Bob?
That's right, Bing. How 'bout this town? ls it wild or what?
It's like one giant sand trap, and me without my wedgie.
Hey, let's give a big hand for Brooke Shields.
I find my son and lose my enemy.
You did your old man proud,
Aladdin.
- I was just trying to stay alive.
- Huh!
If you didn't fight, you would've been killed.
So says the code of the Forty Thieves.
Does this code have any rules that don't end in death?
It's a strict code.
But there is one thing that I added.
We never hurt the innocent.
Uh, for future reference,
I'm as innocent as the day I was hatched.
Oh, brother!
My men don't even know about this place.
Listen, boy, there is a treasure, the ultimate treasure.
Compared to this, a pharaoh's tomb is a pauper's grave, a sultan's fortune nothing but lunch money.
And I am this close to it.
That's tantalizingly close.
But it's on an island that is never in the same place twice.
- The Vanishing lsle.
- That would be a problem.
- What is this ultimate treasure?
- The big one, boy.
The Hand of Midas.
- It's just a myth.
- It's not a myth, boy!
It was once right here.
Look, there's your proof.
From stern to stem, every piece of rigging, every peg and board, all of it, solid gold!
Ooh!
Adopt me, daddy-o!
- Touched by the Hand of Midas.
- And sunk by it.
Oh, you don't understand. You don't know what it's like to have nothing.
To stare up at the palace and know you deserve more.
To be called "street rat."
Yes, I do.
I knew exactly what I wanted for my family-- the best.
I couldn't give up and go back empty-handed.
But the weeks turned into months, and the months turned into years.
I came back to Agrabah one night, but I couldn't find my wife or my son.
I thought my family was lost forever.
At that moment, I would've traded anything to get your mother back.
We never wanted gold.
We wanted you.
I wanted a father. I still do.
Come to my wedding. This time, you have an invitation.
Aladdin, l-l just don't know.
Dad, I'm not going back to Agrabah until morning.
At least think about it?
Aladdin may never understand, but it just wouldn't work.
I don't belong in his world.
The oracle doesn't belong in his world either.
It belongs in the hands of two enterprising treasure hunters: you and me.
The oracle. It's probably just another dead end.
It works! That's how the kid found you.
- It knows everything.
- Everything?
And I know where they stashed it.
Cassim, we are talking about... the wedding of your only son.
It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
How can I pass it up?
- Captain, over here.
- Show yourself!
You're alone. Good.
So you are the one with information about the Forty Thieves?
What would you say if I handed you... the King of Thieves?
I'd say, "What in it for you?"
I'll just sleep better knowing that he's off the streets... and on the executioner's block.
Everyone knows that the King of Thieves cannot be caught.
What miracle do you possess?
Two words that will make you
Agrabah's greatest hero.
Open sesame.
- Hop on, Dad.
- Oh, no.
It's a rug. You sweep dirt under it.
You don't fly on it. At least I don't.
- Don't be afraid. It's fun.
- I am not afraid!
- Now get off that thing before you break your neck.
- I trust Carpet with my life.
- Give him time. He'll come around.
- We'll take horses.
Horses were good enough for my father and his father before him, and they were always good enough for me.
- He sounds like a father, all right.
- Uh-huh.
Whoa! This is the spot, men.
- But there is nothing here.
- Now. But watch.
Open caraway!
There is still nothing here.
When I get ahold of that no good--
But I thought you said it was "open sesame."
Easy. Whoa. Whoa! Hey, hey!
- Looks like Genie has everything ready.
- Yeah. Uh-huh.
Genie? You have a genie? Have you used all three wishes yet?
Oh, please, don't go into it.
It's just too painful.
Oh, Al, you're back, and your front!
- You're both here!
- That's great, Genie. Uh--
- Security's tight.
No big crowd.
Immediate family only.
- Perfect, because this is my--
- No lowlifes this time, other than the parrot, of course.
Observe.
You have violated the perimeter of the Aladdin and Jasmine wedding.
Prepare to be vaporized.
Thank you.
Armed and dangerous.
I'd like to see one of those
Forty Thieves get within an inch of your wedding.
Allow me to introduce--
The King of Thieves.
- All units, we have a code red.
- Code red! Code red!
- Code red! Code red!
Code red! Code red!
Code red! Code red!
Code red! Code red!
Code red! Code red! Code red!
Code red! Code red!
Come on, boys. Follow me.
- Cavalry, forward!
- Code red! Code red! Code red!
- Geronimo!
- Arapaho!
- Navajo!
- Pocahontas.
- Code red! Code red! Code red!
- C-C-C-C-C-Code red! C-C-C-C-C--
- Code red!
- Do not attempt to move, or we'll be shooting ourselves.
- Genie!
- Back off, Al. This creep's got a yellow sheet as long as my arm.
Genie, meet my dad.
Stand down, men.
Smoke 'em if you got 'em.
If you're Al's dad... and the King of Thieves,
- I just want to know one thing.
- Yeah?
Will you be having the chicken or the sea bass?
Come on, Dad. I can't wait for you to meet Jasmine and the Sultan.
Ahem, Al. Don't you think we oughta lose the "Agrabah's Most Wanted" Iook?
- What's wrong with the way I look?
- When you're here, you're not the King of Thieves.
You're my dad.
Mmm, I had more practise being the King of Thieves.
Oh, come on.
Enough of this dark past.
Let's roll out something a little new.
It's a big, bright beautiful future
Thank your lucky stars you're alive
You got someone special to talk to
A friend that you can trust for life
You've been on your own with no family ties
But those solo days are done
You'll be two of a kind spending quality time together
As father and son
Building model ships
Takin' fishin' trips
Workin' hand in hand
Painting the palace
Mowin' the sand
First and ten to go, with your daddy-o!
Once you break the ice
You can postulate paternal advice
I see you're travelling at the speed of light. That's the theory of relatives.
It's a fine
"fantabulous" future
I see fruit on the family tree
You'll be great as a grumpy old grandpa
Bouncin' babies on your knee
You can fall asleep on the comfy couch
After playin' one-on-one
Dreaming back to back that you walloped the Shaq
Together as father and son
May be a bumpy ride
We'll make it side by side
Good afternoon.
I'll be your travel guide!
Move over, laddie
Make room for Daddy
Got a whole new shoulder to cry on
Take a chance now
Give it a spin
You've had chums for pallin' around with
But you never had a friend like him
Put your checkered past behind you now
No more living on the run
Face the big, bright beautiful future
- Together
- Together
- Together
- Together
As father and son
My boy Aladdin must be born under a lucky star... to find such a treasure.
You are most definitely
Aladdin's father.
-And I have the DNA to prove it.
-Oh, it must have been dreadful.
- Trapped by the Forty Thieves.
- Uh-oh.
I try to block out the memories.
Say no more. Not another word on the subject.
Yes, let's turn our attention to happier thoughts.
- The blessed union of our children.
- Indeed.
It worked, Genie.
They love him.
It was the hat. Nothing does the trick like a smart chapeau.
- It's more than that.
- Ah, to be back among civilized people.
- Back among family.
- All he needed was a second chance.
- It's a miracle.
- You'll pay for this!
- You traitor!
- You sold us out!
- My nose!
- He's not in there!
You didn't capture the King of Thieves?
Because he was not at the hideout!
He had to be there.
Where else would he be?
- Uh, apologies, Captain Rasoul.
- What?
- What?
Well, the Sultan said he won't be able to sentence your prisoners until tomorrow.
What's more important than sentencing my prisoners?
Why, the wedding. Princess Jasmine and
Aladdin are finally getting married.
Aladdin? You didn't capture
Aladdin with the others?
Why would he be with the Forty Thieves?
Because his father is the King of Thieves!
Ooh, where can he be?
Oh, I do hope nothing's wrong.
Perhaps we should dispatch a search party, hmm?
Now, Father, I'm sure he's on his way.
- Where is he?
- Hakuna matata.
Whoa! I was having an out-of-movie experience.
My guess is he wants to make an entrance.
Here's the monkey's lock picks.
You know how to use 'em?
I promise you, bird, after this I go straight.
Straight to the dungeon.
We've been expecting you.
Do you think something is wrong?
- Genie, can you find him?
- I'll sniff him out.
I need a scrap of his clothes or a lock of his hair or a shoe.
A shoe's good.
- Huh?
- Ohh!
- Rasoul, what is the meaning of this?
Your Majesty, meet the King of Thieves.
- Dad!
- We seized him in the treasury.
- He was after this again.
- No.
And this is his accomplice.
Big misunderstanding!
It's a slap on the wrist and, uh, community service kind of thing.
Now I know why you really came back.
Your father is the leader of the Forty Thieves?
B-B-B-But this is most p--
Aladdin, did you know?
I thought I could change him.
I had to try.
You can change my clothes, Aladdin.
You can't change who I am.
And the law is crystal clear on what we must now do.
Father, isn't there another way?
I'm afraid there is not. Take the prisoners to the dungeon.
- Dungeon?
- For life.
Life?
There are some wishes that even I can't make come true.
The oracle was right. My dad was trapped in the world of the Forty Thieves.
Trapped by his own greed. I was so stupid to think I could change him.
Trying to show him a better life wasn't stupid, Al.
Leaving him alone with the parrot, that was stupid.
Everything was perfect before he came into my life.
I just want things the way they were.
Genie, I need my father's clothes.
A-A-A-Al, what, did you wrap the turban too tight?
Come on! Why you wanna dress in the King of Thieves ensemble?
Might I suggest something that doesn't actually say, "Arrest me!"
It fits. Good.
I'm seeing-- I'm seeing nothing for your future if you dress like this!
I'm breaking my father out of that dungeon. The guards will never know I was there.
Tonight the King of Thieves will make his most miraculous escape ever.
Out of my life!
It's the cape talking, isn't it?
Since he's captured the King of
Thieves, there's no living with Rasoul.
Well, it wasn't exactly easy living with him before.
- Who?
- I've come to say goodbye.
- Why are you--
- We don't have much time.
While the guards chase me, you get out.
- I can't let you--
- Forget it.
They can't catch me.
He even sounds like me.
When the Sultan gives me my due,
I'll put the good word in for you, the little people who--
It can't be.
He was here. I know it.
- The King of Thieves!
- No man could've escaped that cell.
He-- He isn't a man, I say.
He's a demon!
I want him, dead or alive.
Surround the block!
He's close. I can feel it.
- Well, which way did he go?
- I don't see him.
Look over there. Hurry!
There! The King of Thieves on the roof!
Get up there! Now! Now! Now!
- Found him!
- Lost him.
- Which way did he go?
- I heard him over there.
- Over there!
- Over there!
- There!
Gotcha!
The King of Thieves.
Your charmed life is over,
Your Majesty!
You!
Yes.
Well, I guess I'll have to settle for the Prince of Thieves.
We shall see if the Sultan wants you in his family now.
Keep your hands off my son!
- Dad?
- Hurry, son. We must move.
- Did we lose him?
- I don't know, but I did lose my lunch back there.
They won't be able to pick up our trail 'til daylight.
By then, we'll be long gone from Agrabah.
I'm sorry for what you lost.
But you can't go back now.
You know that. What are you doing?
I'm not going with you. I can't.
Well, you can't go back.
The moment they saw your face, your life in Agrabah was over.
I have to go back.
Jasmine is there.
Kid, it's over.
You're a criminal now.
I won't do what he did.
I won't run away.
- I never ran away from anything in my life.
- You ran away from your family.
I told you what happened. What else could I do? What else can you do?
The right thing.
You should take this back.
- You can't!
- I won't walk out on Jasmine.
- Aladdin.
- I'm your son, but I can't live your life.
Al, they'll lock ya up.
If there's a punishment,
I'll take it.
- So be it.
- We have the oracle!
- The treasure's just waiting for us.
- The oracle?
- I had nothing left to lose.
- Yes, you did.
It was supposed to be a father-son outing.
- Go with him, lago.
- What?
You mean it? Really?
Go.
Good luck, kid.
From 40 thieves down to 7.
What are we to do?
How did they find us? How did they learn the magic words?
- Another raid?
- Not again.
It is a good day to die.
Or to come back from the dead.
- Sa'luk?
- You're alive?
- Impossible.
I'm a survivor, like all of you.
No thanks to Cassim.
- The King?
- You saw him?
- What's he want us to do now?
He wants you to rot in the palace dungeon.
Bah! The King of Thieves is loyal to the end.
- Pushovers!
- Ouch!
He betrayed you, sold you out.
You have always hated the King.
Why should we believe you?
How do you think the guard got the magic words?
He told him the magic words?
- I don't believe it.
- Me neither.
You've forgotten what life was like before Cassim.
I remember a time when crime was sublime
There was plenty of loot in the lair
We'd plunder and pillage and ransack a village
With nary a worry or care
Then along came this king with his soft-hearted dream
But he ratted us out in the end
So rally the troops
We were meant to regroup
And return to our roots once again
Are you in or out
Gotta know without a doubt
I'm the one you need for a dirty deed
I'm the best
Success is guaranteed
Are you men or mice
Take a slice of my advice
You want a fearless leader
One that's strong and stout
Better vote for me
Are you in or out
- We used to be smart
- Yes, horrendously heartless
In a ravaging raid we were rough
We knew that we had to be blissfully bad
Then Cassim brought this sensitive stuff
And we strayed from the path of our rigorous wrath
- Now we're taking a bath in the dust
- Huh?
But we'll reclaim our winnings
Our humble beginnings
In turmoil and torture we trust
Are you in or out
Double-crossers or devout
Put your faith in me
Pretty soon you'll see
I'm the prince of generosity
Are you foe or friend
Here's the path I recommend
You wanna ride to fame
I've got the fastest route
What's it gonna be
Are you in or out
We'll go robbing in all the right places
From Agrabah dunes to Paris
Imagine the fear on their faces
When we drop by for cookies and tea
Come along, boys. Follow me!
Are you in or out
- If you're with me give a shout
- Yeah!
I'll lead you all the way into the glory days
We'll begin a life of crime that pays
Are you out or in
Make your choice now
Sink or swim
You can stick with me or stay behind and pout
What's it gonna be
Consider carefully
Are you in
Or out
I know the treasure's limitless, but I'm not crazy about a 40-way split.
If it was just, uh, you and me--
I would never cut my men out of the deal.
They're my family, my only family.
I can always count on them.
I'm home!
Why don't they look happy to see you?
We are. We're thrilled.
- Hurry, little friend.
- I'm wriggling. I'm wriggling.
I am growing impatient, Cassim.
Ask the question.
- We must be, uh--
- Just a little further.
Further out to sea.
- No. Ask it now!
- Now's good.
Where can we find the Hand of Midas?
The Vanishing lsle will appear at dawn.
I will show you the way!
There's your setting, Captain.
Frankly, my boy, your actions were most disappointing.
It is tragic, Your Highness, but the street rat... has obviously followed in his father's footsteps.
Aladdin is a criminal.
I object, Your Honour.
I object to that outrageous statement... and I object to a tertiary character having any lines during my big courtroom scene.
Here, take this to a higher court. Ciao!
Your Honour, if I may enter a plea of insanity, because I'm crazy about this kid.
Genie, I can handle this myself.
Sultan, I convinced my dad to come here.
It was my fault.
I would have been better off if I had never known him.
Aladdin, you found your father, a father who risked his freedom to see your wedding.
And you risked everything to help him, just as I would for my father.
Your father. Uh-- Oh, yeah.
Uh, well-- Uh--
Aladdin, I could not overlook your father's crimes, but what you have done, well, you did it out of love.
And you came back to take responsibility for your actions.
Let us put this matter behind us.
I believe we have postponed the wedding long enough.
Good call! Okay, let's give a big hand for the wise and generous Sultan! Yes!
- Al's-- dad-- Sa'luk--
- Just take a deep breath, lago.
- Now, what about Aladdin's father?
- It's Sa'luk, the guy AI beat.
He's not beat. He's back, and he's got Cassim.
That's his problem. He chose to go back to that life.
Al, I know your dad made a lot of bad choices, but that doesn't mean you have to.
He is your father.
How can you do anything else?
I'm being as stubborn as he was.
Show me the way.
Yeah.
You have arrived.
- Help!
- Where is it?
- I see nothing.
- Nothing but fog.
- I've had enough of your trickery!
- No, this is it.
The Vanishing lsle. Watch.
Look out!
- The Vanishing lsle.
- On the back of a giant turtle.
And never in the same place twice. Let's get closer.
Time to rock and roll, dude!
Now I am here. I am here.
- Huh?
- How 'bout a packet of Nutty Buddies?
- Genie, we need a distraction.
- Survey says,
"Show me turtle"!
Boom! Another fake blow to the head! Boom!
Oh, no, he's got him in the half nelson.
Now he's got him in the full nelson!
Oh, no! The dreaded
Ozzie Nelson!
Rick, boys, maybe you wanna come over here and see what's happening?
He's comin' in quick.
Oh, no, he's up! He's down.
And he's actually inside the turtle.
We'll be right back after a brief message.
Tickle, tickle, tickle!
It took me years to find my father.
I'm not losing him again.
- You came to help me?
- How could I do anything else?
Now, let's get that treasure of yours.
Amazing!
There!
Whoa.
- Feels like Genie got carried away.
- No! It's the Vanishing lsle.
The turtle is diving.
We must climb higher!
We're almost there!
Don't you see, Aladdin?
We were meant to do this together.
Come on!
Pity I didn't find this place years ago.
This would be much easier if I were much younger.
Aladdin!
See? It pays to have a junior partner.
Be careful. Don't touch the golden hand.
Heads up.
The Hand of Midas!
Time to go, Aladdin!
Nobody's going anywhere.
Give the Hand of Midas to me,
Cassim, or your son dies.
-Sa'luk, your battle is with me!
-Don't worry, Dad. I can take him alone.
But you're not alone, not any more.
You want the Hand of Midas,
Sa'luk?
Take it!
The Hand of Midas is mine!
And also, the life of your brat.
What are you staring at?
Oh. No! No!
No! No!
Hurry, son.
We're running out of time.
Come on, Dad. You can do it.
Yes. But it would be a lot easier without this.
After all these years, you finally have your treasure.
This thing? No.
This wretched thing almost cost me the ultimate treasure.
It's you, son.
You are my ultimate treasure.
I'm just sorry it took me this long to realize it.
The Hand of Midas can take its curse to the bottom of the sea!
It's gold. It's turned everything to solid gold.
Oh, we are sinking!
I didn't see where they went, and they could be anywhere!
There they are.
Get up here, you blasted rug!
- You actually trust this thing?
- With my life, son.
Genie!
- Genie!
- Present!
Let's go home. We have some unfinished business.
Yes!
Out in the open? No mask?
Pretty risky, if you ask me.
Even a wanted man can risk a bit to see his own son's wedding.
So, you little turkey, come to say goodbye?
Nah, I already said my goodbyes.
Of course, the monkey had to cry, and that got me goin'.
- You're not gonna live in the palace?
- With the newlyweds?
It'll be all lovey-dovey.
I'd just as soon keep my will to live.
Well, I don't know where I'm going, but you are welcome to come along for the ride.
You're a good guy, Cassim.
But not too good.
So it goes short and sweet
They were wed down the street
May their marriage be truly blessed
Happy end to the tale
And tomorrow's a sale
So I'd better go home and rest
Here's a kiss and a hug
Sure you don't need a rug
I assure you the price is right
Well, Salaam, worthy friend
Come back soon, that's the end
'Til another
Arabian night

Wait a minute. We're not gettin' outta here, man!
We're not gettin' outta here!
Don't ya understand it, man?
This is it! Game's over, man!
{520}{631}Once upon a time,|there was a princess and a peasant.
{640}{728}She lived atop a hill|in a glittering castle.
{737}{804}There she had a servant|who kept her castle in order...
{820}{897}... selected and pressed her robes|for the day...
{907}{1044}... prepared her royal breakfast|and served it to her in her chambers.
{1056}{1113}- She had fame, she had fortune.|- Bravo. Delightful.
{1117}{1201}She had product endorsements.
{1210}{1304}But she was not what she seemed.
{1317}{1392}On the other hand,|in a humble village far away...
{1400}{1477}... the peasant had none of her luxuries,|but he had a dream.
{1517}{1575}So with a fond farewell|from his closest friends...
{1585}{1666}... and gifts of good luck,|best wishes...
{1675}{1747}... and useless junk...|Although it's the thought that counts.
{1755}{1827}- His world was about to|clash with hers...
{1836}{1893}... in a place called Hollywood.
{1898}{1924}Goodbye!
{5218}{5318}Since I was a little kitten|I had a dream
{5358}{5497}My name in lights|Danny, the song and dance cat
{5543}{5646}I got on a bus and came to the town|Where dreams can come true
{5678}{5723}It's gonna happen for me
{5763}{5814}It could happen for you
{5848}{5872}Who, me?
{5878}{5988}You can do anything|If you try
{6013}{6087}The most impossible dream|Can come true
{6111}{6139}If you believe it
{6148}{6244}This is my kind of town|It's as clear as the nose on your face
{6278}{6372}This is the time|This is the place
{6408}{6432}This is the time
{6438}{6476}- So long.|- Taxi!
{6480}{6562}This must be the place|Hollywood
{6580}{6643}Where the streets|Are paved with gold
{6650}{6713}Where the kitties never grow old
{6718}{6761}In Hollywood
{6811}{6907}Hollywood|Where the stars don 't shine at night
{6923}{7033}They walk around in the broad daylight|In Hollywood
{7103}{7156}Dig that face|They ain 't seen nothing like it
{7161}{7247}Anyplace|It's right above the movie screen
{7256}{7306}If you know what I mean
{7358}{7442}Look at me|I'm gonna be the cat to see
{7455}{7513}I'm going down in history
{7518}{7547}Just watch me!
{8455}{8487}Hollywood
{8518}{8617}Where the streets are paved with gold
{8630}{8731}Where dreams can never grow old
{8746}{8858}Right here in Hollywood
{9319}{9379}Well, hi, there, ma'am.|How you doing?
{9396}{9439}What's your name there? Okay.
{9444}{9494}I'm Danny. Do you mind if I sit down?
{9501}{9568}- Excuse me.|- Cranston!
{9576}{9648}Don't mind him, Danny.|He was just leaving.
{9731}{9820}Hi. I'm Tillie. This is Cranston.|Cranston, Danny. Danny, T.W.

{9929}{9984}So, new in town?
{9991}{10063}I just arrived. L...
{10079}{10138}I hear Farley Wink|gets good parts for animals.
{10144}{10194}If you call hanging from a hook|a good part.
{10201}{10237}At least it's a part, huh?
{10244}{10371}There's no use trying, Miss Tillie.|My fortune cookie last night said:
{10378}{10445}"Give it up, you loser."
{10453}{10499}I need a drink.
{10548}{10582}All right, now, let's see.
{10589}{10627}"Go to Hollywood." Check.
{10656}{10690}What you got there?
{10693}{10741}Well, this is a plan I worked out.
{10746}{10870}You see, I figure if I work real hard,|by Friday I'll land my first big part.
{10881}{10944}Well, that's how it worked|for you, right?
{10954}{10992}- Oh, sure. Right.|- Oh, right.
{10999}{11023}Why not Thursday?
{11029}{11098}Now, Danny, you just go in|and let Mr. Wink know you're here.
{11106}{11192}They're casting a big Noah's Ark movie.|Lots of work for animals.
{11201}{11237}Your tie is a little crooked.
{11244}{11311}Wait a minute. Straighten you up,|dust you off and perfect.
{11319}{11364}Good luck.
{11411}{11455}- Thanks a lot.|- Look, you big ape!
{11461}{11517}I need those two monkeys|for another picture.
{11521}{11583}What? This is a bad time.|I'm casting the Ark picture.
{11591}{11646}Get off the line!|Yes, hello. Wink here.
{11698}{11751}- Mr. Wink?|- Yes!
{11756}{11843}If you have any openings for a talented|cat, I'm your man. I mean, your cat.
{11851}{11892}Send over two chickens and two lions.
{11899}{11964}But don't send them over|in the same car this time.
{11979}{12024}Let's see now.
{12129}{12198}- Say, you. Can you play a cat?|- I am a cat.
{12214}{12279}How would you like to be|in the next Darla Dimple picture?
{12291}{12373}The Darla Dimple? America's sweetheart,|lover of children and animals?
{12378}{12443}One and the same, kid.|One and the same.
{12451}{12542}Just sign here, here, here, here,|and here and here and here and here...
{12551}{12599}...and over there and down the middle...
{12709}{12810}- Sawyer, what happened to you?|- Did you walk under a ladder?
{12818}{12845}Smash a mirror?
{12852}{12950}- Have you looked in one lately?|- No. A cat crossed my path.
{12959}{13011}- Really? Orange tabby?|- Yeah.
{13026}{13069}- Green vest? Straw hat?|- Yeah. Yeah.
{13076}{13124}- What a koinky-dink.|- How'd you know?
{13131}{13179}Hippo intuition.
{13239}{13299}- And initial this.|- Wow, this is a dream come true.
{13306}{13392}Yeah, yeah, yeah, but don't forget,|10 percent of that dream is mine.
{13401}{13473}Welcome to Hollywood!
{13509}{13557}Farley Wink's Animal Agency.|Can I help you?
{13561}{13621}- You need a lamb for the Moses picture?|- Yeah!
{13629}{13682}Oh, a sacrificial lamb?
{13689}{13751}- No, no.|- Sorry, fresh out.
{13756}{13807}Every day I ask myself|why I put up with this.
{13814}{13864}- For the glamour.|- What, this pigsty?
{13872}{13905}- No offense, Herb.|- None taken.
{13911}{14000}Unless of course, you're|referring to the glamour of filing...
{14009}{14071}...the romance of typing.
{14081}{14146}- Tillie, what are you doing?|- I'm just fixing you up.
{14151}{14233}You'll wanna look pretty|in case you meet someone nice.
{14239}{14304}Yeah, right. As if he'll come waltzing|right through that...
{14312}{14367}You're gonna be fine, kid.|You're the cat's meow.
{14371}{14412}You can meow, can't you?
{14419}{14469}Where's Sawyer?
{14474}{14555}- Sawyer. Sweetie, baby!|- Whatever it is, the answer is no.
{14561}{14590}- I'm in a jam.|- Too bad.
{14596}{14656}- Can't find a female cat for the picture.|- Tough tabby.
{14666}{14717}- So guess who gets to fill in.|- You?
{14724}{14820}Nah, I only fill in|for those dashing Clark Gable types.
{14829}{14867}Frankly, Clark, I don't give a...
{14872}{14920}- Sawyer!|- I'm a secretary, not an actress.
{14927}{14972}- Give you Sundays off.|- Never work Sunday.
{14976}{15003}- Double time.|- Triple.
{15006}{15033}- Triple?|- There an echo?
{15039}{15080}- You're pushing me!|- No chow, no meow.
{15086}{15170}Okay, okay, triple time. Here's your|partner. He's new in town. Be nice.
{15189}{15216}Forget it.
{15219}{15298}A deal is a deal.|Now get on over to Mammoth Pictures.
{15364}{15405}You're...
{15412}{15467}You're... You're soaking wet.
{15474}{15507}Is it raining outside?
{15514}{15603}Because it was sunny when I came in,|and back where I come from...
{15609}{15693}Here, let me get the door for you.|Where I come from you see clouds first.
{15702}{15726}- Stay.|- After you.
{15732}{15789}And then the rain comes after it.
{15886}{15953}I'm sorry. Miss?
{16394}{16456}Oh, I'm telling you,|one more plucking scene...
{16464}{16507}...and... right in the gizzard.
{16512}{16610}So aggravating and humiliating.|I'm out of this picture business.
{16619}{16719}There's no place like home.|There's no place like home.
{16817}{16906}So I guess we're gonna be|the only two cats on the ark, huh?
{16915}{16989}- Pretty great, huh?|- So much for preserving the species.
{17004}{17061}Hey, Kong, how's the picture coming?
{17081}{17156}Don't get me started!
{17201}{17254}You know the King?
{17267}{17317}On my side of the tram,|home of Darla Dimple...
{17324}{17389}...America's sweetheart.|Look for Darla in Lil Ark Angel...
{17394}{17452}...coming soon to a theater near you.
{17525}{17587}All right, everybody.|We're ready for Darla's big ark.
{17629}{17711}Hey. Hey, mister. I could|help you push that cart, you know.
{17720}{17772}Hey. What are you doing?|Get out of here, kid.
{17777}{17820}Let me help, will you?
{17827}{17875}I'm little but I'm strong.
{17882}{17946}- These sweets are for Miss Dimple.|- Okay, all right.
{17954}{18009}You don't have to get mad.
{18047}{18078}I'm busted.
{18085}{18111}- Hey.|- Hey.
{18117}{18155}You're the cat from this morning?
{18162}{18253}- What are you doing here?|- That ice thing is just my side job.
{18262}{18298}Name's Peabo Pudgemyer.
{18301}{18352}But you can call me Pudge.
{18359}{18434}Time to start.|Better go get your costume.
{18527}{18553}Script! Script! Script!
{18587}{18649}"Meow"? Is that all?|Where's the rest?
{18657}{18722}- You're looking at it.|- But I thought this was a musical.
{18727}{18777}We're supposed to sing and dance,|aren't we?
{18782}{18851}Oh, for the love of Moby Dick.
{18859}{18957}Listen, tiger, this town has rules.|Around here, cats say "meow."
{18967}{19075}But that's so old hat. I'm sure|no one would mind if I jazz this up a bit.
{19081}{19146}All right, learn it the hard way.
{19302}{19405}Meow, see.|Yeah, that's it, meow, meow.
{19427}{19485}Quiet on the set, please. Quiet!
{19492}{19554}Miss Dimple is ready to begin.
{19562}{19626}Lights! Camera!
{19672}{19725}Action.
{19732}{19777}Cue the elephant.
{19832}{19865}Tusk, tusk, hair.
{19872}{19946}- The hair, the hair, fix the hair.|- Sorry.
{20335}{20414}Now, the people, they were so bad
{20423}{20497}That the Lord made the rain come down
{20509}{20579}And he washed away their bad cities
{20587}{20659}And he washed away their bad towns
{20675}{20749}And all of the people drowned
{20845}{20914}With the animals it was different
{20920}{20992}Though some of them drowned too
{21008}{21077}The others were just poor animals
{21082}{21181}And they didn 't know what to do
{21187}{21285}So I built a little boat
{21307}{21367}As cute as it can be
{21387}{21504}And I put all the animals two by two|In my little boat on the sea
{21530}{21561}The moo cows went:
{21600}{21631}The piggies went:
{21672}{21735}And all the little birdies went|Tweet, tweet, tweet
{21742}{21795}In my little boat on the sea
{21815}{21853}The doggy went:
{21892}{21923}The kitty cat went:
{21990}{22026}The lion went:
{22207}{22339}- In my little boat on the sea|- Talking about the boat on the sea
{22450}{22496}On the sea
{22568}{22592}Meow?
{22597}{22693}- Cut! Cut, cut, cut!|- Cut? Yes, cut.
{22702}{22750}Let me down this instant!
{22757}{22800}Lower Miss Dimple! Lower her!
{22804}{22852}Hurry! Hurry! Lower Miss Dimple!
{22915}{22989}Darla. Darla, darling. Here...
{23105}{23223}Flanigan, the title of this movie|is Lil Ark Angel.
{23250}{23296}- Isn't it?!|- Yes. Yes.
{23300}{23374}And who here is an angel?
{23385}{23437}Can you tell me who here is an angel?!
{23445}{23534}Why you are, Darla, sweetheart,|celebrity, darling.
{23543}{23627}- Angel.|- That's right! I am an angel!
{23632}{23750}I am an adorable little angel!
{23760}{23794}Bonbons will make it better.
{23797}{23838}- Hot fudge sundae?|- Your choo-choo?
{23845}{23876}Your ducky?
{23883}{23984}I hate animals!
{23992}{24031}Especially that one!
{24135}{24190}Get me down from here!
{24197}{24259}Flanigan!
{24287}{24350}Oh, dear, what a calamity.
{24545}{24620}Max!
{24627}{24673}We're doomed.
{24702}{24745}Hide me!
{25317}{25399}Yes, Miss Dimple.
{25563}{25628}Been nice knowing you, pal.
{25950}{26024}How does the kitty cat go?
{26058}{26094}Meow?
{26108}{26189}Very good.
{26262}{26341}Will that be all, Miss Dimple?
{26350}{26449}For the moment. Thank you, Max.
{26715}{26768}- Your curls are fine.|- Your nails are precious.
{26772}{26828}- Goodbye, Miss Dimple.|- Goodbye, Miss Dimple.
{26900}{26948}Okay, everybody. From the top.
{26963}{27090}And I hope there will be|no more interruptions.
{27255}{27361}- Cue me, Frances.|- So the kitty cat went:
{27445}{27486}Now, just cut that out.
{27491}{27560}Besides, it was much more like:
{27825}{27878}Danny, wait.
{27943}{28014}Now see what you made me do.
{28042}{28081}Oh, dear.
{28085}{28128}Maybe one of us should talk to him.
{28135}{28209}Hello. I'll do it.|It's time somebody set that cat straight.
{28218}{28300}Since he tap-danced into town,|he's been nothing but trouble.
{28321}{28426}Well, I guess this is gonna|set me back a whole day.
{28475}{28533}Maybe only half a day.
{28541}{28617}Listen, I'm sorry your feelings got hurt,|but the fact is, since you...
{28625}{28690}I don't get it.|What happened in there, anyway?
{28711}{28742}- Did I hit a sour note?|- Wait.
{28748}{28800}Because if I did,|I could go back in there.
{28808}{28885}- I could fix it.|- You don't... Danny, they don't care.
{28890}{28931}- But l...|- Don't you get it?
{28938}{29029}What is it with you? Why are you so|determined to make a fool of yourself?
{29046}{29096}What do you mean?
{29101}{29163}All I wanna do is the thing I love.
{29171}{29207}Doesn't everyone?
{29303}{29399}- It's not that simple.|- It is in Kokomo.
{29416}{29502}Then maybe that's|where you should have stayed.
{29970}{30071}You can do anything|If you...
{30094}{30129}I better not sing right now.
{30230}{30281}You want some?
{30316}{30354}No thanks, Pudge.
{30358}{30413}I was gonna slug|that big dumb Max for you...
{30421}{30493}...but I didn't wanna hurt the guy.
{30528}{30595}So, what's that Dimple kid's problem?
{30600}{30675}- I thought you were great today.|- I'm glad you liked it.
{30686}{30753}You know, all that:
{30801}{30873}No, it's a little more like...
{30881}{30950}Here, I'll show you.
{31563}{31611}Hey, hey, hey.
{31618}{31707}Wait a minute. Where's...?|Where's that music coming from?
{32230}{32310}- It's him. It's Woolie the Mammoth.|- It's him. It's Woolie the Mammoth.
{32573}{32657}That's it! B flat.
{32663}{32793}Why, you have a natural rear for music,|little fellow. Little fellow.
{32836}{32946}If my old eyes aren't failing me,|I'd say...
{32956}{33040}...you're the fellow|who caused all that commotion today.
{33069}{33145}Yeah. I guess I really upset Miss Dimple.
{33151}{33213}Yes, you did.
{33221}{33286}Jolly good show!
{33353}{33430}- Tea time. Would you chaps like a cup?|- Sure.
{33436}{33556}Splendid! It's a special peanut brew|from India, the upper regions.
{33731}{33796}Did you know the peanut|is not a nut at all?
{33804}{33892}And it's not a pea|for that matter either.
{34003}{34085}It's rather odd that they call it a nut|because it isn't a nut, you see.
{34094}{34187}It's... It's... It's a member|of the legume family.
{34198}{34237}Sugar?
{34244}{34373}- Yeah.|- Wait, wait. How about pea legume?
{34384}{34427}No, that wouldn't make sense either.
{34434}{34520}But whatever it is,|it makes a splendid tea.
{34651}{34757}My grandmother developed this recipe,|with certain additions from yours truly.
{34774}{34827}I forgot the cream.|Would you like some cream?
{34833}{34872}- No, no!|- Don't go to any trouble!
{34876}{34941}All right. All right.|Suit yourself, suit yourself.
{35024}{35110}That music was great, Woolie.|Did you write it for some movie?
{35124}{35186}No, no, it's not for any movie.
{35194}{35297}I used to hope that one day|I'd write music for the motion pictures.
{35307}{35414}But all they wanted me for|was to put on those beastly tusks and...
{35546}{35591}...at the beginning of every film.
{35599}{35695}- What a waste of your talent.|- Oh, it's the same for everyone.
{35701}{35735}Look behind you.
{35779}{35894}So many, many broken dreams.
{35958}{35992}Is that Sawyer?
{36019}{36110}Poor Sawyer.|I thought she'd be the one to make it.
{36119}{36212}Such a dancer|with the voice of an angel.
{36221}{36262}I never would have guessed.
{36269}{36333}That's what this town does to you,|my boy.
{36339}{36368}It wears you down.
{36373}{36443}But I thought Hollywood|was always looking for new talent.
{36452}{36560}Talented people, not animals.
{36629}{36665}You see...
{36672}{36756}...the spotlight will never be|on fellows like you and me.
{36776}{36855}And it's foolish|to think otherwise, Danny.
{36919}{36960}Danny?
{36967}{37034}Yeah. Foolish.
{37273}{37307}Unless...
{37371}{37397}...we can remind them.
{37439}{37525}- Of what?|- Why they came here in the first place.
{37652}{37714}All right, all of you, listen up!
{37722}{37803}I only need you, water buffalo,|for the Tarzan jungle stampede.
{37811}{37866}The rest of you, go home.
{37874}{37994}Well, today's shot.|Might as well go home and clean.
{38284}{38327}Here's our chance, Pudge. Come on!
{38357}{38409}Hey, everybody!
{38474}{38553}Look who's back.|I wish he'd get himself stuffed.
{38559}{38633}I know a divine taxidermist, darling.
{38639}{38682}Did my first husband.
{38704}{38766}Come on, everybody, gather around
{38774}{38829}Don 't let this old town get you down
{38856}{38919}Look at you there|With the long, long face
{38929}{38981}Hey, he must be talking to you.
{38994}{39109}You take this and you take that|Come on over here, T. W., put on this hat
{39119}{39208}If we all work together|We can make our dreams come true
{39224}{39291}Let's show the world what we can do
{39334}{39406}- Pudge?|- Yeah.
{39887}{39952}Boogie with me!
{40062}{40131}I got rhythm in my feet
{40164}{40226}I got rhythm in my heart and soul
{40269}{40346}I got rhythm, hot and sweet
{40375}{40434}Sometimes rhythm|Makes me lose control
{40484}{40599}I want everyone to have all the fun
{40631}{40667}That I have
{40692}{40778}I've got rhythm|So do you
{40790}{40847}Let's turn it on|And show what we can do
{40851}{40887}Bye!
{41529}{41563}Perfect.
{41567}{41661}How could you possibly|improve a face like this?
{41690}{41733}What is that hideous racket?
{42379}{42444}Look at them.|I'm ashamed to be an animal.
{42450}{42538}Shut up, you old nanny,|and show old Franny what you got.
{42602}{42640}Hey.
{43629}{43742}Come on, Sawyer.|Grab a partner and do-si-do.
{43844}{43912}Hey, Sawyer, dance with me?|I hear you're a natural.
{43919}{43948}Who told you that?
{43989}{44066}Listen, it's a waste of time.|You'll never get to dance in the movies.
{44074}{44132}Movies? Did I say movies?|No, we're just having fun.
{44139}{44185}Yeah, sure. Forget it.
{44447}{44558}Just look at those fools.|Laughable, isn't it, Max?
{44570}{44608}Max?
{44710}{44744}Max!
{44885}{44962}Not bad. A little rusty|but, hey, who's perfect?
{44967}{45010}Rusty?
{45189}{45242}I'll give you rusty.
{46148}{46222}Like I said, dancing's a waste of time.
{46242}{46304}What if I could get you|an audition with L.B. Mammoth?
{46309}{46386}L.B. Mammoth?|Head of Mammoth Studios?
{46397}{46455}- What?|- I know he'd appreciate real talent.
{46462}{46548}After nothing but Darla,|he's gotta be starving for it.
{46602}{46681}- You're dreaming, Danny.|- Maybe I am.
{46688}{46752}But so were you|just a few minutes ago.
{47030}{47095}Can you really get us an audition|with the boss, Danny?
{47100}{47126}It's worth a try.
{47130}{47250}Once he sees us, there'll be|a whole new set of stars in town.
{47280}{47340}An audition?
{47355}{47443}Max! Invite that cat...
{47452}{47534}...to tea.
{47625}{47685}Thanks for coming over, Donald.
{47690}{47726}Danny.
{47740}{47769}Danny.
{47777}{47806}Animal cracker?
{47840}{47893}No? More for me.
{47960}{48061}I wanted to apologize|for what Max did the other day.
{48073}{48157}He's so bad sometimes.
{48165}{48232}- No, it's all right, Miss Dimple. Really.|- No, no, no.
{48239}{48311}It was terrible. Awful.
{48318}{48361}Cruel.
{48370}{48452}Inappropriately violent.
{48475}{48537}And I wanna make it all up to you.
{48555}{48619}No, no, you don't have to.
{48640}{48681}Oh, I insist.
{48688}{48762}- Is there anything you need?|- No.
{48770}{48861}Isn't there something I could do for you?
{48870}{48913}I don't think so.
{48922}{48999}Isn't there a certain someone|who runs a certain studio...
{49008}{49087}...that I could introduce you to?
{49168}{49206}Well...
{49235}{49314}Is there any way that you can arrange|for me and the other animals...
{49323}{49366}...to perform for L.B. Mammoth?
{49373}{49440}Why, Denis, I'd be delighted.
{49445}{49493}Idea!
{49500}{49567}Maybe you can all do a number|in my movie.
{49572}{49642}- You...? You mean it?|- Why, it's just what the picture needs.
{49650}{49724}- Oh, but I couldn't impose.|- I'll give you use of my sound stage...
{49733}{49793}...my ark, and anything else|you might need.
{49801}{49863}- Really?|- You get all your little friends ready...
{49867}{49956}...and I'll make sure L.B.|Sees your splashy debut.
{49965}{50039}- Oh, thank you, Miss Dimp...|- Call me Darla.
{50046}{50120}- Thank you, Darla.|- Don't mention it.
{50145}{50232}Sawyer could do a romantic ballad,|and Woolie can even play a piano solo.
{50302}{50338}Did you hear that, Max?
{50345}{50403}Woolie, the elephant...
{50411}{50468}...can even play a solo.
{50535}{50591}Don't you think|that would be a good idea?
{50597}{50645}Well, I think...
{50650}{50760}- You really want my advice?|- Oh, yes. Oh, yes, please.
{50770}{50818}Well...
{51071}{51174}I've seen 'em come|And I've seen 'em go
{51185}{51271}There's one thing that I know
{51280}{51373}You gotta give the people|What they want
{51393}{51506}Or you'll wind up back in Kokomo
{51523}{51575}Nebraska
{51606}{51670}- Indiana, Miss Dimple.|- Whatever.
{51675}{51775}They like it big, they like it loud
{51801}{51889}Maybe a little bit jazzy sometimes
{51898}{52001}Mr. Pussycat, listen to me
{52010}{52080}You don 't have to be good
{52087}{52214}But you had better be
{52225}{52261}Get hot, Miss Dimple.
{52278}{52357}Big and loud
{52386}{52438}Big and loud
{52481}{52565}Gonna make your mama proud
{52615}{52656}Make it big
{52733}{52908}And loud
{53270}{53386}Leaves you kind of speechless, don't it?
{53400}{53462}- Thank you, Darla.|- Oh, no, no, no.
{53470}{53535}I just made a few|professional "suggestments."
{53545}{53624}You just get all your little friends ready|by Friday at 3...
{53631}{53669}...and I'll take care of L.B.
{53676}{53753}And let's keep this between us,|shall we?
{53760}{53851}I don't like to advertise|my charitable work.
{53860}{53930}Oh, sure. Thanks, Miss Dimple.
{53935}{53990}- Thanks a lot.|- You're welcome, Dino.
{53996}{54049}- Goodbye.|- Ta-ta!
{54060}{54122}See you in the movies.
{54288}{54315}Publicity Department.
{54320}{54388}Is L.B.'s big press conference|still Friday at 3?
{54393}{54503}- Yes, it is, Miss Dimple.|- Oh, thank you so much.
{54746}{54830}I didn 't get where I am today
{54851}{54947}By letting myself get pushed around
{54998}{55123}No man or beast or kitty cat or doggie
{55143}{55242}Is going to drag me down
{55261}{55295}Shut up, Max.
{55300}{55382}The lightning will be flashing
{55400}{55470}The thunder, it will roar
{55495}{55572}They'll never know what hit 'em
{55583}{55706}Wait'll they see what I have in store
{55733}{55810}Big and loud
{55819}{55917}It's gonna be big and loud
{55941}{56083}When they fall, they'll really fall
{56103}{56189}And they're gonna fall big
{56225}{56336}And they're gonna fall loud
{56359}{56430}They're gonna fall big
{56448}{56505}And
{56624}{56655}Shut up, Max.
{56665}{56783}Loud
{56958}{57047}"Thunder and lightning." Check.|Special effects all ready, Danny.
{57066}{57136}All right, everybody.|Mr. Mammoth will be here any minute.
{57141}{57225}Get into position. Remember,|do it just like you did in the alley.
{57231}{57294}Only make it big and loud this time.
{57300}{57396}- And don't be nervous.|- Nervous? Why would I be nervous?
{57421}{57449}Give me that.
{57591}{57684}Well, well. Run of the sound stage,|use of Darla's ark costumes.
{57694}{57787}- I don't know. Something smells fishy.|- I beg your pardon.
{57794}{57885}- Sorry, it's just that I smell a rat.|- Excuse me?
{57891}{57963}- Never mind.|- So you decided to join us, huh?
{57971}{58033}Me? Oh, no, no, no.|This is never gonna work.
{58039}{58108}Besides, how did you arrange all of this?
{58130}{58190}Let's just say|a little angel's looking out for us.
{58198}{58249}- Oh, boy.|- Come on, Sawyer.
{58256}{58338}Your life isn't back there|in that office, it's here.
{58346}{58422}- It's 3:00, Danny.|- Dance with me.
{58493}{58524}See you onboard.
{58531}{58584}- Well?|- I can't do this.
{58591}{58634}- And?|- I can't do this.
{58638}{58724}- So?|- I can't believe I'm doing this.
{58733}{58851}Fortune says, "Rough waters ahead."
{58861}{58892}Start the rain, Pudge!
{58896}{58992}When L.B. Shows up,|we'll all come out singing and dancing.
{59216}{59264}Ladies and gentlemen of the press...
{59268}{59333}...I bring you|the founder of Mammoth Pictures...
{59341}{59446}...Mr. L.B. Mammoth!
{59613}{59688}Gee whiz, Mr. Mammoth,|what's the secret of your success?
{59741}{59816}Simple. It's Dimple.
{59866}{59957}Dainty, delightful, Darla Dimple
{59984}{60049}The recipe for a Darla Dimple movie.
{60053}{60173}Begin with one part adorable character|in jeopardy.
{60227}{60349}Sorry, penguin, but into each life,|a little rain must fall.
{60359}{60428}Max, man the valve.
{60436}{60527}Yes, Miss Dimple.
{60613}{60680}Add two parts perky determination.
{60694}{60776}More water, Max. More water.
{60883}{60950}Sprinkle in an air of innocence.
{60964}{61048}Wind, Max. We must have wind!
{61346}{61420}- Stir in...|- More water!
{61513}{61573}- Add a pinch of...|- Thunder!
{61754}{61830}- And an itsy-bitsy dash of...|- Lightning!
{62144}{62206}Mix it all together|and what do you get?
{62946}{63021}Throw the anchor!|Somebody throw the anchor.
{63236}{63299}It's L.B.! We're on!
{63339}{63442}Pack up your troubles in your old kit bag|And smile, smile, smile
{63452}{63538}"Your life isn't back there at the office,"|he says. "Dance with me," he says.
{63544}{63628}You know what your problem is? You're|pushy, self-centered, pigheaded...
{63636}{63670}- No offense, Herb.|- None taken.
{63697}{63783}Action. We're pushing, we're pushing.|We're running, we're running.

{66297}{66350}But it wasn't...
{66364}{66424}It wasn't their fault.
{66822}{66905}Nice working with you, Danny.

{71865}{71946}Life's gonna turn
{71975}{72049}Just a little unkind
{72188}{72320}Seems like everyone's sailin '|Way out on the sea
{72350}{72438}And I'm stuck here on the shore
{72520}{72659}Sun 's always shinin '|But it's never for me
{72687}{72846}Why should I try anymore?
{72870}{73002}Tell me lies, tell me lies

{73188}{73320}This time I've got|To believe

{301}{420}I deliver perfection...|and don't brag about it! :D
{446}{529}Long ago, in the faraway land|of ancient Greece...
{535}{598}there was a golden age|of powerful gods...
{604}{666}and extraordinary heroes.
{672}{741}And the greatest and strongest|of all these heroes...
{747}{810}was the mighty Hercules.
{816}{878}But what is the measure|of a true hero?
{884}{932}Ah, that is what our story is...
{938}{968}Will you listen to him?
{974}{1041}He's makin' the story|sound like some Greek tragedy.
{1047}{1079}Lighten up, dude.
{1085}{1130}We'll take it from here, darling.
{1136}{1210}You go, girl.

{1630}{1677}many eons ago.
{1683}{1717}{y:i}Ah
{1723}{1790}{y:i}Back when the world was new
{1796}{1858}- Whoa!|{y:i}- The planet Earth was down on its luck
{1864}{2012}{y:i}And everywhere gigantic brutes|{y:i}called Titans ran amok
{2018}{2084}{y:i}It was a nasty place
{2090}{2150}{y:i}There was a mess|{y:i}wherever ya stepped
{2156}{2265}{y:i}Where chaos reigned and earthquakes|{y:i}and volcanoes never slept
{2271}{2304}Whoo! Say it, girlfriend!
{2310}{2342}{y:i}And then along came Zeus
{2348}{2413}{y:i}- He hurled his thunderbolt|{y:i}- He zapped
{2419}{2498}{y:i}- Locked those suckers in a vault|{y:i}- They're trapped
{2504}{2591}{y:i}And on his own|{y:i}stopped chaos in its tracks
{2597}{2630}{y:i}And that's the gospel truth

{2746}{2812}{y:i}- And that's the world's first dish|- Yeah, baby.
{2818}{2887}{y:i}Zeus tamed the globe|{y:i}while still in his youth

{2960}{3034}{y:i}That's the gospel truth
{3040}{3092}{y:i}On Mount Olympus life was neat
{3098}{3168}{y:i}And smooth as sweet vermouth

{5196}{5261}Fabulous party. You know, I haven't|seen this much love in a room...

{8187}{8242}Hey. Love to, babe...
{8248}{8312}but unlike you gods|lounging about up here...
{8318}{8372}I regrettably|have a full-time gig...
{8378}{8459}that you, by the way,|so charitably bestowed on me, Zeus.
{8465}{8542}So, can't.|Love to, but can't.
{8548}{8634}You ought to slow down.|You'll work yourself to death.
{8640}{8746}Hah! Work yourself to death!
{8764}{8818}Oh, I kill myself!
{8824}{8888}If only. If only.
{8894}{8995}If there's one god you don't want|to get steamed up, it's Hades.
{9001}{9060}'Cause he had an evil plan.
{9066}{9171}{y:i}He ran the underworld
{9177}{9265}{y:i}But thought the dead|{y:i}were dull and uncouth
{9271}{9348}{y:i}He was as mean|{y:i}as he was ruthless
{9354}{9445}{y:i}And that's the gospel truth
{9451}{9560}{y:i}He had a plan|{y:i}to shake things up
{9566}{9828}{y:i}And that's the gospel truth
{9930}{9967}Pain!
{9973}{10081}Coming,|your most lugubriousness. Ow!
{10124}{10248}- Panic!|- Oh, I'm sorry. I can handle it!
{10395}{10457}- Pain! Oh!|- And Panic!
{10463}{10509}Reporting for duty!
{10515}{10592}Fine, fine, fine. Just let me know|the instant the Fates arrive.
{10598}{10637}Oh. They're here.
{10643}{10747}What? The Fates are here,|and you didn't tell me?
{10753}{10869}We are worms!|Worthless worms!
{10875}{10997}Memo to me, memo to me:|maim you after my meeting.
{11037}{11158}Darling, hold that mortal's|thread of life...
{11164}{11258}good and tight.
{11330}{11405}Incoming!
{11584}{11638}Ladies.|I am so sorry that I'm...
{11644}{11690}- Late!|- We knew you would be.
{11696}{11744}We know everything.
{11750}{11798}- Past.|- Present.
{11804}{11847}And future.
{11853}{11920}Indoor plumbing.|It's gonna be big.
{11926}{11984}Great, gr... Anyway, see, ladies, I|was at this party and I lost track of...
{11990}{12079}- We know!|- Yeah. I know you know.
{12085}{12155}So here's the deal. Zeus...
{12161}{12252}Mr High and Mighty, Mr "Hey, You,|Get Off Of My Cloud,"... now he has...
{12258}{12332}- A bouncing baby brat.|- We know!
{12338}{12401}I know you know!|I know. I got it.
{12407}{12461}I got the concept.|So let me just ask:
{12467}{12538}is this kid gonna mess up|my hostile takeover bid, or what?
{12544}{12601}- What do you think?|- Oh, no you don't.
{12607}{12703}We're not supposed|to reveal the future.
{12709}{12749}Oh, wait. I'm sorry.|Time out. Can I...
{12755}{12794}Can I ask you a question by the way?|Are you...
{12800}{12853}Did you cut your hair or something?|You look fabulous.
{12859}{12953}I mean, you look like a Fate|worse than death.
{12962}{13003}Oh, gross!
{13009}{13096}Yech! It's blinkin'!
{13108}{13195}Ladies, please.|My fate...
{13201}{13249}is in your lovely hands.
{13255}{13356}- Oh.|- Oh, all right.
{13387}{13492}In 18 years precisely...
{13498}{13555}the planets will align...
{13561}{13634}ever so nicely.
{13640}{13664}Ay, verse. Oy.
{13670}{13729}The time to act|will be at hand.
{13735}{13834}Unleash the Titans,|your monstrous band.
{13840}{13870}Mm-hmm. Good, good.
{13876}{14000}Then the once-proud Zeus|will finally fall...
{14006}{14075}and you, Hades...
{14081}{14151}will rule all!
{14157}{14216}Yes! Hades rules!
{14222}{14320}- A word of caution to this tale.|- Excuse me?
{14326}{14475}Should Hercules fight,|you will fail.
{14553}{14603}What?
{14609}{14712}Okay, fine, fine.|I'm cool. I'm fine.
{14716}{14798}Pain? Panic?|Got a little riddle for ya.
{14804}{14877}How do you kill a god?
{14883}{14919}I do not know!
{14925}{14962}You can't. They're immortal?
{14968}{15006}Bingo! They're immortal!
{15012}{15121}So, first you got to turn|the little sunspot...
{15127}{15209}mortal.
{15860}{15918}- Huh?|- Wha... What is it?
{15924}{16005}The baby!
{16101}{16236}Hercules! Oh!
{16256}{16389}No!
{16395}{16427}Now we did it!
{16433}{16481}Zeus is gonna use us|for target practice!
{16487}{16576}Just hang on to the kid, Panic!
{16633}{16705}Hurry! Let's just kill the kid|and get it over with, okay?
{16711}{16824}Here you go, kid.|A little Grecian formula.
{16825}{16915}Look at that! He's changing.|Can we do it now?
{16921}{16994}No, no, no. He has to drink|the whole potion.
{17000}{17112}- Every last drop!|- Who's there?
{17209}{17283}Alcmene, over here.
{17289}{17358}Oh, you poor thing.
{17364}{17407}- Oh, don't cry.|- Is anybody there?
{17413}{17491}- Now?|- Now.
{17497}{17571}Oh. Well, he must|have been abandoned.
{17577}{17635}Amphitryon, for so many years...
{17641}{17717}we've prayed to the gods|to bless us with a child.
{17723}{17775}Perhaps they've answered|our prayers.
{17781}{17815}Perhaps they have.
{17821}{17904}"Hercules"?
{18337}{18386}Help, help, help!
{18392}{18444}Hades is gonna kill us|when he finds out what happened.
{18450}{18510}You mean, if he finds out.
{18516}{18571}Of course he's gonna f...
{18577}{18666}If. If is good.
{18672}{18782}It was tragic. Zeus led all the gods|on a frantic search.
{18788}{18879}But by the time they found the baby,|it was too late.
{18885}{18994}{y:i}- Young Herc was mortal now|{y:i}- Mmm
{19000}{19083}{y:i}But since he did not drink|{y:i}the last drop
{19089}{19161}{y:i}He still retained|{y:i}his godlike strength
{19167}{19274}{y:i}- So thank his lucky stars|- Tell it, girl.
{19280}{19394}{y:i}- But Zeus and Hera wept|{y:i}- Ooh, ooh, ooh
{19400}{19485}{y:i}Because their son|{y:i}could never come home
{19491}{19551}{y:i}They'd have to watch|{y:i}their precious baby
{19557}{19650}{y:i}Grow up from afar
{19656}{19772}{y:i}Though Hades'horrid plan
{19778}{19853}{y:i}Was hatched before Herc|{y:i}cut his first tooth
{19859}{19957}{y:i}- Ahh|{y:i}- The boy grew stronger every day
{19963}{20060}{y:i}And that's the gospel truth
{20066}{20292}{y:i}The gospel truth
{20484}{20573}Hercules, slow down!
{20627}{20677}Look out!
{20683}{20721}Oops! S-S-Sorry, guys!
{20727}{20817}- Hey, watch where you're goin'!|- Sunday driver!
{20887}{20925}Thanks, son.
{20931}{21016}When old Penelope twisted her ankle|back there, I thought we were done for.
{21022}{21097}- No problem, Pop.|- Uh, don't-don't-don't unload just yet.
{21103}{21146}First, I have to finagle|with Phideas.
{21152}{21207}Okay.
{21213}{21259}Oops. Sorry, Penelope.
{21265}{21341}Now, Hercules, this time,|please just...
{21347}{21396}I know, I know.
{21402}{21457}Stay by the cart.
{21463}{21545}That's my boy.
{21607}{21641}Oh, my goodness. Whoa!
{21647}{21709}Careful!
{21715}{21770}- Why, thank you.|- No problem.
{21776}{21853}Why, Hercules! I-I-It's you!
{21859}{21944}- Let me, let me help you with that.|- No, no, no, no, no. I got it!
{21950}{21995}I'm fine.|You just run along.
{22001}{22039}- Are you sure?|- Oh, yes.
{22045}{22128}Absolutely.
{22180}{22233}Yo! Give it here!
{22239}{22308}Hey, you need an extra guy?
{22314}{22364}Uh, sorry, Herc.
{22370}{22429}Uh, we already got five...
{22435}{22475}and we want to keep it|an even number.
{22481}{22535}- Hey, wait a second. Five isn't an ev...|- See ya, Herc.
{22541}{22602}- What a geek!|- Destructo Boy.
{22608}{22708}- Maybe we should call him "Jerkules."|- Yeah!
{22835}{22870}Heads up!
{22876}{22960}- I-I got it!|- No! Stop!
{23001}{23099}Uh-oh. Oh, no.
{23105}{23180}It's okay.
{23311}{23396}Hey! Whoa!
{23499}{23567}- Son!|- Hang on, Pop! Be right back!
{23573}{23639}Oh, my! Oh, no! Don't!|Oh, no, no, no, no!
{23645}{23742}No, no, no, no, no, no!
{23836}{23914}Watch out!
{24244}{24322}Nice catch, Jerkules.
{24328}{24392}Son.
{24398}{24515}This is the last straw,|Amphitryon!
{24521}{24555}That boy is a menace!
{24561}{24668}He's too dangerous|to be around normal people!
{24668}{24720}He didn't mean any harm.|He's just a kid.
{24726}{24819}He-He just can't control|his strength.
{24825}{24926}I'm warning you.|You keep that-that-that...
{24932}{24968}freak away from here!
{24974}{25065}Freak! Yeah, go away!
{25348}{25447}Son, you shouldn't let those things|they said back there get to ya.
{25453}{25513}But, Pop, they're right.|I-I am a freak.
{25519}{25594}I-I try to fit in.|I really do.
{25600}{25666}I just can't.
{25672}{25752}Sometimes I feel like...
{25758}{25821}like I really|don't belong here...
{25827}{25940}like I'm supposed to be|someplace else.
{25946}{25993}Hercules, son...
{25999}{26081}I know it doesn't make any sense.
{26305}{26366}{y:i}I have often dreamed
{26372}{26423}{y:i}Of a far-off place
{26429}{26559}{y:i}Where a great, warm welcome|{y:i}will be waiting for me
{26565}{26615}{y:i}Where the crowds will cheer
{26621}{26682}{y:i}When they see my face
{26688}{26843}{y:i}And a voice keeps sayin'|{y:i}this is where I'm meant to be
{26849}{26911}{y:i}I will find my way
{26917}{26963}{y:i}I can go the distance
{26969}{27038}{y:i}I'll be there someday
{27044}{27096}{y:i}If I can be strong
{27102}{27158}{y:i}I know every mile
{27164}{27255}{y:i}Will be worth my while
{27261}{27422}{y:i}I would go most anywhere|{y:i}to feel like I
{27428}{27565}{y:i}Belong
{27608}{27678}Hercules, there's something|your mother and I...
{27684}{27771}have been meaning to, to tell ya.
{27777}{27871}But if you found me,|then where did I come from?
{27877}{27933}Why was I left here?
{27939}{28086}This was around your neck|when we found you.
{28104}{28148}It's the symbol of the gods.
{28154}{28237}This is it! Don't you see?|Maybe they have the answers.
{28243}{28332}I'll go to the temple of Zeus and...
{28358}{28436}Ma, Pop...
{28442}{28548}you're the greatest parents|anyone could have, but...
{28554}{28636}I-I gotta know.
{29046}{29109}{y:i}I am on my way
{29115}{29161}{y:i}I can go the distance
{29167}{29227}{y:i}I don't care how far
{29233}{29285}{y:i}Somehow, I'll be strong
{29291}{29343}{y:i}I know every mile
{29349}{29432}{y:i}Will be worth my while
{29438}{29506}{y:i}I would go most anywhere
{29512}{29690}{y:i}To find where I belong
{30111}{30158}Oh, mighty Zeus...
{30164}{30263}please, hear me|and, and answer my prayer.
{30269}{30341}I need to know:|Who am I?
{30347}{30444}Wh-Where do I belong?
{30552}{30635}Huh?
{30724}{30869}My boy.|My little Hercules.
{30900}{30951}Hey, hey, hey.|Hold on, kiddo!
{30957}{31008}What's your hurry?|After all these years...
{31014}{31095}is this the kind of hello|you give your father?
{31101}{31137}F-F-Father?
{31143}{31212}Didn't know you had|a famous father, did you?
{31218}{31284}Surprise!
{31290}{31336}Look how you've grown.
{31342}{31403}Why, you've got your mother's|beautiful eyes...
{31409}{31458}and my strong chin.
{31464}{31530}- Hah!|- I-I don't understand.
{31536}{31627}If you're my father,|that would make me a...
{31633}{31664}A god.
{31670}{31728}A god. A god!
{31734}{31791}Hey, you wanted answers,|and by thunder...
{31797}{31857}you're old enough now|to know the truth.
{31863}{31947}But why did you leave me on Earth?|Didn't you want me?
{31953}{32061}Of course we did. Your mother and I|loved you with all our hearts.
{32067}{32150}But someone stole you from us|and turned you mortal...
{32156}{32232}and only gods|can live on Mount Olympus.
{32238}{32271}And you can't do a thing?
{32277}{32322}I can't, Hercules,|but you can.
{32328}{32398}R-Really? W-What?|I'll do anything.
{32404}{32479}Hercules, if you can prove yourself|a true hero on Earth...
{32485}{32530}your godhood|will be restored.
{32536}{32602}A true hero. Great!
{32608}{32688}Uh, exactly how do you become|a true hero?
{32694}{32797}First, you must seek out Philoctetes,|the trainer of heroes.
{32803}{32868}Seek out Philoctetes.|Right. I'll...
{32874}{32922}- Whoa!|- Whoa! Hold your horses!
{32928}{33010}Which reminds me.
{33119}{33194}Ha-ha! You probably|don't remember Pegasus...
{33200}{33300}but you two go way back, son.
{33450}{33495}Oh, Pegasus!
{33501}{33545}He's a magnificent horse...
{33551}{33647}with the brain of a bird.
{33672}{33740}I'll find Philoctetes,|become a true hero!
{33746}{33774}That's the spirit!
{33780}{33881}I won't let you down, Father!|Yee-hah!
{33887}{33974}Good luck, son.
{34006}{34061}{y:i}I will beat the odds
{34067}{34109}{y:i}I can go the distance
{34115}{34167}{y:i}I will face the world
{34173}{34218}{y:i}Fearless, proud and strong
{34224}{34276}{y:i}I will please the gods
{34282}{34324}{y:i}I can go the distance
{34330}{34387}{y:i}Till I find my hero's welcome
{34393}{34466}{y:i}Right where I
{34472}{34813}{y:i}Belong
{35313}{35390}Whoa!
{35404}{35498}Y-You sure|this is the right place?
{35730}{35772}W-What's the matter, little guy?|You stuck?
{35778}{35876}- Whoa! Hey, butt out, buddy!|- Ugh!
{35882}{35940}Girls! Stop! Stop!|Come back! Come back, come back!
{35946}{36015}Whoa, whoa! Oh, jeez!
{36021}{36106}Wait! Whoa, whoa, whoa!|Oh, nymphs!
{36112}{36214}- They can't keep their hands off me.|- Hey!
{36277}{36324}What's the matter?|You never seen a satyr before?
{36330}{36391}Uh, no.|Can you help us?
{36397}{36508}We're looking for someone|called Philoctetes.
{36514}{36556}- Call me Phil.|- Phil!
{36562}{36616}- Ow!|- Boy, am I glad to meet you!
{36622}{36735}I'm Hercules,|and this is Pegasus.
{36740}{36801}Animals. Disgusting.
{36807}{36922}I need your help.|I want to become a hero, a true hero.
{36930}{36978}Sorry, kid.|Can't help ya.
{36984}{37023}- Wait.|- Whoo!
{37029}{37073}Uh, sorry. Why not?
{37079}{37186}Two words: I am retired.
{37192}{37231}Look, I gotta do this.
{37237}{37279}Haven't you ever had a dream...
{37285}{37385}something you wanted so bad|you'd do anything?
{37413}{37528}Kid, come inside.|I want to show you somethin'.
{37694}{37763}Watch it! That was part|of the mast of the "Argo".
{37769}{37806}- The "Argo"?|- Yeah.
{37812}{37894}Who do you think taught Jason|how to sail? Cleopatra?
{37900}{37956}I trained|all those would-be heroes.
{37962}{38074}Odysseus, Perseus, Theseus.|A lot of "yeuseus".
{38080}{38138}And every single one|of those bums let me down...
{38144}{38184}flatter than a discus.
{38190}{38258}None of'em|could go the distance.
{38264}{38329}And then there was Achilles.
{38335}{38377}Now there was a guy|who had it all...
{38383}{38425}the build, the foot speed.
{38431}{38475}He could jab.|He could take a hit.
{38481}{38536}He could keep on comin'.
{38542}{38601}But that "furshlugginer"|heel of his!
{38607}{38760}He barely gets nicked there once|and kaboom! He's history.
{38776}{38813}Yeah, I had a dream once.
{38819}{38898}I dreamed I was gonna train|the greatest hero there ever was.
{38904}{39001}So great, the gods would hang|a picture of him in the stars...
{39007}{39041}all across the sky...
{39047}{39132}and people would say,|"That's Phil's boy."
{39138}{39182}That's right.
{39188}{39231}Eh, but dreams are for rookies.
{39237}{39280}A guy can only take|so much disappointment.
{39286}{39333}But I'm different|than those other guys, Phil.
{39339}{39435}I can go the distance.|Come on. I'll show ya.
{39441}{39486}Jeez. You don't give up, do ya?
{39492}{39584}Watch this.
{39628}{39672}Holy Hera.
{39678}{39756}You know, maybe if I...|No! Snap out of it!
{39762}{39809}I'm too old to get mixed up|in this stuff again.
{39815}{39853}But if I don't become|a true hero...
{39859}{39929}I'll never be able|to rejoin my father Zeus.
{39935}{40005}Hold it.|Zeus is your father, right?
{40011}{40053}Uh-huh.
{40059}{40140}Zeus, the big guy.|He's your daddy.
{40146}{40238}Mr Lightning Bolts!|Read me a book, would ya, Da-Da?
{40244}{40310}Zeus!|"Once upon a time..."
{40316}{40416}- It's the truth!|- Please!
{40440}{40489}{y:i}So you wanna be a hero, kid
{40495}{40564}{y:i}Well, whoop-de-do
{40570}{40616}{y:i}I have been|{y:i}around the block before
{40622}{40675}{y:i}With blockheads just like you
{40681}{40732}{y:i}Each and every one|{y:i}a disappointment
{40738}{40819}{y:i}Pain for which|{y:i}there ain't no ointment
{40825}{40906}{y:i}So much for excuses|{y:i}Though a kid of Zeus is
{40912}{40989}{y:i}Askin'me to jump|{y:i}into the fray
{40995}{41098}{y:i}My answer is two words
{41135}{41165}Okay.
{41171}{41201}You mean you'll do it?
{41207}{41252}- You win.|- You won't be sorry, Phil.
{41258}{41310}- Oh, gods.|- So when do we start? Can we start now?
{41316}{41382}Oy, vay.
{41388}{41454}{y:i}I'd given up hope|{y:i}that someone would come
{41460}{41497}{y:i}Along
{41503}{41556}{y:i}A fella who'd ring the bell|{y:i}for once
{41562}{41611}{y:i}Not the gong
{41617}{41669}{y:i}The kind who wins trophies
{41675}{41728}{y:i}Won't settle for low fees
{41734}{41774}{y:i}At least semipro fees
{41780}{41847}{y:i}But, no|{y:i}I get the greenhorn
{41853}{41954}{y:i}I've been out to pasture, pal|{y:i}My ambition gone
{41960}{42070}{y:i}Content to spend lazy days|{y:i}and to graze my lawn
{42076}{42130}{y:i}But you need an advisor
{42136}{42188}{y:i}A satyr, but wiser
{42194}{42279}{y:i}A good merchandiser|{y:i}and... whoa
{42285}{42374}{y:i}There goes my ulcer|{y:i}I'm down to one last hope, and I hope
{42380}{42421}{y:i}It's you
{42427}{42536}{y:i}Though, kid, you're not|{y:i}exactly a dream come true
{42542}{42591}{y:i}I trained enough turkeys
{42597}{42650}- "Who never came through"|- Whoa!
{42656}{42742}{y:i}You're my one last hope|{y:i}so you'll have to do
{42748}{42835}Rule number six:|when rescuing a damsel...
{42841}{42926}always handle with care.
{42934}{43004}No!
{43010}{43114}Rule number 95, kid: concentrate!
{43129}{43181}Rule number 96:
{43187}{43234}aim!
{43240}{43289}{y:i}Demigods have faced the odds
{43295}{43346}{y:i}And ended up a mockery
{43352}{43387}{y:i}Don't believe the stories
{43393}{43471}{y:i}That you read|{y:i}on all the crockery
{43477}{43579}{y:i}To be a true hero, kid|{y:i}is a dyin' art
{43585}{43644}{y:i}Like paintin' a masterpiece
{43650}{43695}{y:i}It's a work of heart
{43701}{43751}{y:i}It takes more than sinew
{43757}{43812}{y:i}Comes down to what's in you
{43818}{43903}{y:i}You have to continue to grow
{43909}{43956}Now that's more like it!
{43962}{44018}{y:i}I'm down to one last shot
{44024}{44110}{y:i}And my last high note
{44116}{44238}{y:i}Before that blasted underworld|{y:i}gets my goat
{44244}{44284}{y:i}My dreams are on you, kid
{44290}{44338}{y:i}Go make 'em come true
{44344}{44384}{y:i}Climb that uphill slope
{44390}{44446}{y:i}Keep pushin' that envelope
{44452}{44490}{y:i}You're my one last hope
{44496}{44572}{y:i}And, kid, it's up to
{44578}{44668}{y:i}You
{44674}{44749}Yeah!
{44772}{44815}Did you see that?
{44821}{44898}Next stop, Olympus.
{44904}{44947}All right.|Just take it easy, champ.
{44953}{44999}I am ready.|I want to get off this island.
{45005}{45062}I want to see battles|and monsters.
{45068}{45110}Rescue some damsels.
{45116}{45164}You know, heroic stuff.
{45170}{45247}- Well.|- Aw, come on, Phil!
{45253}{45331}Well, okay, okay.|You want a road test? Saddle up, kid.
{45337}{45418}- We're goin' to Thebes!|- Ya-hoo!
{45424}{45484}- So what's in Thebes?|- A lot of problems.
{45490}{45600}It's a big, tough town.|Good place to start buildin' a rep.
{45626}{45661}Sounds like your basic DID...
{45667}{45772}- Hyah!|- Damsel in distress!
{45894}{45950}Not so fast, sweetheart.
{45956}{46010}I swear, Nessus.|Put me down or I'll...
{46016}{46103}Whoo!|I like 'em fiery!
{46109}{46177}Now remember, kid.|First, analyse the situation.
{46183}{46298}Don't just barrel in there|without thinking. Eh?
{46304}{46340}He's losin' points for this!
{46346}{46440}- You don't know what you're...|- Halt!
{46465}{46528}Step aside, two legs.
{46534}{46618}Pardon me, my good, uh, uh, sir.
{46624}{46666}I'll have to ask you to release|that young...
{46672}{46736}- Keep movin', junior.|- lady.
{46742}{46825}But you... Are-Aren't you|a damsel in distress?
{46831}{46902}I'm a damsel.|I'm in distress.
{46908}{46976}I can handle this.|Have a nice day.
{46982}{47024}Uh...
{47030}{47140}Ma'am, I'm afraid you may be too close|to the situation to realize...
{47144}{47225}Ohhh! What are you doin'?|Get your sword!
{47231}{47380}Sword. Right, right. Rule number 15:|a hero is only as good as his weapon!
{47530}{47603}Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold it! Hold on!|He's gotta do it on his own.
{47609}{47679}Come on, kid!|Concentrate!
{47685}{47748}Use your head!
{47754}{47828}Oh.
{47904}{47972}All right!|Not bad, kid!
{47978}{48076}Not exactly what I had in mind,|but not bad.
{48104}{48169}Oh, gee, miss.|I'm, I'm really sorry.
{48175}{48224}- Oh.|- That was dumb.
{48230}{48284}Yeah.
{48290}{48362}Excuse me.
{48458}{48531}Nice work! "Excelente".
{48537}{48584}Is Wonderboy here for real?
{48590}{48706}What are you talkin' about?|Of course he's real. Whoa!
{48712}{48820}And by the way, sweet cheeks.|I'm real too.
{48826}{48860}Ugh!
{48866}{48978}Yee-hah! Ya-hoo!
{49088}{49169}Whoa!
{49762}{49806}- How was that, Phil?|- Reign it in, rookie.
{49812}{49878}You can get away with mistakes|like those in the minor decathlons...
{49884}{49944}but this is the big leagues!
{49950}{49989}At least I beat him, didn't I?
{49995}{50076}Next time, don't let your guard down|because of a pair of big goo-goo eyes!
{50082}{50143}D-oh! It's like I keep tellin' ya.
{50149}{50254}You gotta stay focused,|and you...
{50441}{50515}Are you, uh, all right,|Miss, uh...
{50521}{50565}Megara.|My friends call me Meg.
{50571}{50613}At least they would|if I had any friends.
{50619}{50724}So did they give you a name|along with all those rippling pectorals?
{50730}{50821}Uh, uh, uh, I'm, um, uh...
{50827}{50883}- Uh, uh...|- Are you always this articulate?
{50889}{50982}Hercules. My...|My name is Hercules.
{50988}{51062}Herc... Huh.|I think I prefer Wonderboy.
{51068}{51165}So, uh, uh... How-how-how'd you|get mixed up with the, uh...
{51171}{51227}Pinhead with hooves?|Well, you know how men are.
{51233}{51364}They think "No" means "Yes" and|"Get lost" means "Take me. I'm yours."
{51387}{51466}Don't worry. Shorty here|can explain it to ya later.
{51472}{51522}Well, thanks for everything, Herc.
{51528}{51593}It's been a real slice.
{51599}{51711}Wait! Um, can we give you a ride?
{51752}{51835}Uh, I don't think your pinto|likes me very much.
{51841}{51903}Pegasus? Oh, no.|Don't be silly.
{51909}{52012}He'd be more than happy to... Ow!
{52017}{52080}I'll be all right.|I'm a big tough girl.
{52086}{52175}I tie my own sandals|and everything.
{52192}{52249}Bye-bye, Wonderboy.
{52255}{52312}Bye.
{52318}{52391}She's somethin'.|Isn't she, Phil?
{52397}{52460}Yeah, ye... Oh, yeah.|She's really somethin'.
{52466}{52537}A real pain in the patella!|Earth to Herc!
{52543}{52575}Come in, Herc!|Come in, Herc!
{52581}{52640}We got a job to do, remember?
{52646}{52685}Thebes is still waitin'.
{52691}{52786}Yeah. Yeah. I know.
{53023}{53064}Aw, how cute.
{53070}{53134}A couple of rodents|lookin' for a theme park.
{53140}{53179}Who you callin' a rodent, sister?
{53185}{53253}- I'm a bunny!|- A-And I'm his gopher!
{53259}{53303}Ta-dah!
{53309}{53361}I thought I smelled a rat.
{53367}{53435}- Meg.|- Speak of the devil.
{53441}{53536}Meg, my little flower, my little bird,|my little nut. Meg.
{53542}{53584}What exactly happened here?
{53590}{53652}I thought you were gonna persuade|the river guardian to join my team...
{53658}{53742}for the uprising, and here I am,|kind of river guardian-less.
{53748}{53842}I gave it my best shot, but|he made me an offer I had to refuse.
{53848}{53901}Fine. So instead of subtracting|two years from your sentence...
{53907}{53952}hey, I'm gonna add two on, okay?
{53958}{54006}- Give that your best shot.|- Look. It wasn't my fault.
{54012}{54074}It was this wonderboy, Hercules.
{54080}{54160}Hercules.|Why does that name ring a bell?
{54166}{54232}I don't know.|Um, maybe we owe him money?
{54238}{54345}- What was that name again?|- Hercules.
{54351}{54394}He comes on with this big,|innocent farm boy routine...
{54400}{54443}but I could see through that|in a Peloponnesian minute.
{54449}{54540}Wait a minute. Wasn't Hercules the name|of that kid we were supposed to...
{54546}{54623}Oh, my gods!|Run for it!
{54629}{54707}So you took care of him, huh?
{54713}{54757}Dead as a doornail.
{54763}{54829}Weren't those your exact words?
{54835}{54874}This might be|a different Hercules.
{54880}{54966}Yeah! I mean, Hercules|is a very popular name nowadays!
{54972}{55050}Remember, like, a few years ago,|every other boy was named Jason...
{55056}{55090}and the girls|were all named Brittany?
{55096}{55204}I'm about to rearrange|the cosmos...
{55210}{55287}and the one schlemiel|who can louse it up...
{55293}{55410}is waltzing around in the woods!
{55478}{55517}Wait. Wait, big guy.
{55523}{55589}- We can still cut in on his waltzing.|- That's right.
{55595}{55658}And-And at least we made him mortal.|That's a good thing.
{55664}{55694}Didn't we?
{55700}{55776}Hmm. Fortunately|for the three of you...
{55782}{55872}we still have time to correct|this rather egregious oversight.
{55878}{56003}And this time, no foul-ups.
{56033}{56095}Wow!
{56101}{56183}- Is that all one town?|- One town, a million troubles.
{56189}{56228}The one and only Thebes.
{56234}{56286}The Big Olive itself.
{56292}{56398}If you can make it there,|you can make it anywhere.
{56539}{56646}Stick with me, kid.|The city is a dangerous place.
{56652}{56739}- Look where you're goin', numbskull!|- Hey, I'm walkin' here!
{56745}{56798}See what I mean?|I'm tellin' you. Wackos.
{56804}{56881}Pita bread. Pita bread.|Get your pita bread here.
{56887}{56950}- Hey, Mack.|- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
{56956}{57000}You wanna buy a sundial?
{57006}{57052}He's not interested, all right?|Come on, kid.
{57058}{57131}The end is coming!|Can't you feel it?
{57137}{57200}Yes, yes.|Thank you for the info. Yes.
{57206}{57260}We'll ponder that for awhile.|Just stare at the sidewalk.
{57266}{57296}Come on.|Don't make eye contact.
{57302}{57383}People here are nuts. That's because|they live in a city of turmoil.
{57389}{57494}Trust me, kid. You're gonna be|just what the doctor ordered.
{57496}{57600}It was tragic!|We lost everything in the fire.
{57606}{57704}Everything|except old Snowball here.
{57710}{57771}Now were the fires|before or after the earthquake?
{57777}{57819}They were after the earthquake.|I remember.
{57825}{57858}But before the flood.
{57864}{57938}Don't even get me started|on the crime rate.
{57944}{58030}Thebes has certainly|gone downhill in a hurry.
{58036}{58073}Tell me about it.
{58079}{58124}It seems like every time|I turn around...
{58130}{58177}there's some new monster|wreakin' havoc and I...
{58183}{58296}All we need now|is a plague of locusts.
{58319}{58385}That's it!|I'm movin' to Sparta!
{58391}{58447}Excuse me.
{58453}{58491}It, uh...
{58497}{58611}seems to me that|what you folks need is a hero.
{58617}{58700}Yeah, and who are you?
{58714}{58763}I'm Hercules, and, uh...
{58769}{58851}I happen to be a hero.
{58857}{58902}- Is that so?|- A hero!
{58908}{58960}Have you ever saved|a town before?
{58966}{59018}Uh, no. Uh, not exactly, but I...
{59024}{59080}Have you ever reversed|a natural disaster?
{59086}{59138}Well, uh, no.
{59144}{59234}Oh, listen to thi... He's just another|chariot chaser. This we need.
{59240}{59270}That's a laugh.
{59276}{59332}- Don't you pea brains get it?|- Hmm?
{59338}{59383}This kid is the genuine article.
{59389}{59488}Hey, isn't that the goat-man|who trained Achilles?
{59494}{59529}Watch it, pal.
{59535}{59640}Yeah, you're right.|Hey, uh, nice job on those heels!
{59646}{59704}Ya missed a spot!
{59710}{59758}You... I got your heel|right here!
{59764}{59815}I'll wipe that stupid grin|off your face! You...
{59821}{59888}Hey, Phil! Phil! Phil!
{59894}{59958}What are you, crazy? Sheesh.
{59964}{60048}Young man, we need|a professional hero...
{60054}{60126}not an amateur.
{60132}{60219}Well, wait. Stop!
{60301}{60350}How am I supposed|to prove myself a hero...
{60356}{60394}if nobody|will give me a chance?
{60400}{60430}You'll get your chance.
{60436}{60525}You just need some kind|of catastrophe or disaster.
{60531}{60615}Please. Help! Please!|There's been a terrible accident!
{60621}{60675}- Meg?|- Speakin' of disasters.
{60681}{60740}Wonderboy! Hercules!
{60746}{60787}- Thank goodness.|- Wha-Wha-What's wrong?
{60793}{60823}Oh! Outside of town.
{60829}{60880}Two little boys.|Th-They were playing in the gorge.
{60886}{60945}Th-There was this rock slide,|a terrible rock slide.
{60951}{61014}- They're trapped!|- Kids? Trapped?
{61020}{61055}Phil, this is great!
{61061}{61103}You're really choked up|about this, aren't ya?
{61109}{61158}- Come on!|- No, I... You don't under...
{61164}{61276}I, I have this terrible fear|of heights!
{61364}{61425}I'm right behind ya, kid! Whoo!
{61431}{61494}I'm way behind ya, kid.
{61500}{61572}I got a fur wedgie.
{61700}{61740}- Are you okay?|- I'll be fine.
{61746}{61794}Just get me down|before I ruin the upholstery.
{61800}{61843}Help! I can't breathe!
{61849}{61893}- Hurry!|- Get us out!
{61899}{61955}We're suffocating!
{61961}{62034}Somebody call IX-I-I!
{62040}{62077}Easy, fellas.|You'll be all right.
{62083}{62119}We can't last much longer!
{62125}{62223}Get us out before we get crushed!
{62644}{62690}- How you boys doin'?|- We're okay now.
{62696}{62781}Jeepers, mister.|You're really strong.
{62787}{62869}Well, just try to be a little|more careful next time, okay, kids?
{62875}{62982}We sure will.
{63054}{63087}Stirring performance, boys.
{63093}{63161}I was really moved.
{63167}{63222}"Jeepers, mister"?
{63228}{63301}I was going for innocence.
{63307}{63399}And, hey, two thumbs way,|way up for our leading lady.
{63405}{63452}What a dish.|What a doll.
{63458}{63524}Get outta there, ya big lug,|while ya still can.
{63530}{63578}Phil, I-I did great.
{63584}{63666}They even applauded. Sort of.
{63666}{63719}Huh! I hate|to burst your bubble, kid...
{63725}{63808}but that ain't applause.
{63932}{64014}Ph-Ph-Ph-Phil?|What do you call that thing?
{64020}{64077}Two words:
{64083}{64158}am-scray!
{64193}{64316}Let's get ready to rumble!
{64452}{64502}That's it. Dance around!|Dance around!
{64508}{64586}Watch the teeth! Watch the teeth!|Keep going. Come on. Come on.
{64592}{64700}Lead with your left.|Lead with your left. Your other left!
{65298}{65389}Whoa!
{65966}{66040}All right! All right!|You're bad! Okay!
{66046}{66145}See, Phil?|That... That wasn't so hard.
{66151}{66226}Kid, kid, kid.|How many horns do you see?
{66232}{66278}- Six?|- Eh, close enough.
{66284}{66367}Let's get you cleaned up.
{66432}{66584}Guys, guys, relax.|It's only halftime.
{66623}{66704}That doesn't sound good.
[CUT]
{66854}{66928}Definitely not good!
{67586}{67696}Will you forget|the head-slicing thing?
{67842}{67948}Phil, I don't think we covered this one|in basic training!
{68193}{68300}My favourite part of the game:
{68330}{68408}sudden death.
{68880}{68970}Oh. There goes another one.
{68976}{69066}Just like Achilles.
{69080}{69122}Game...
{69128}{69253}set, match.
{69288}{69376}Hmm?
{69770}{69836}Phil, you gotta admit.
{69842}{69894}That was pretty heroic.
{69900}{70041}Ya did it, kid! Ya did it!|Ya won by a landslide!
{70081}{70164}Hades mad.
{70188}{70284}Well, what do you know?
{70358}{70440}From that day forward,|our boy Hercules could do no wrong.

{71312}{71369}{y:i}With oohs and aahs
{71375}{71440}{y:i}And they slapped his face|{y:i}on every vase

{73687}{73773}{y:i}Yes, indeed
{73808}{73893}Pull!
{73933}{73975}Nice shootin', Rex.
{73981}{74052}I can't believe this guy.|I throw everything I've got at him...
{74058}{74114}and it doesn't even...
{74120}{74207}What are those?
{74213}{74303}Um, I don't know.|I-I thought they looked kinda dashing.
{74309}{74395}I've got 24 hours|to get rid of this bozo...
{74401}{74528}or the entire scheme I've been setting|up for 18 years goes up in smoke...
{74534}{74696}and you are wearing|his merchandise?
{74844}{74938}Thirsty?
{75137}{75258}Looks like your game's over. Wonderboy|is hitting every curve you throw at him.
{75264}{75339}Oh, yeah.
{75345}{75414}I wonder if maybe|I haven't been throwing...
{75420}{75547}the right curves at him,|Meg, my sweet.
{75553}{75595}Don't even go there.
{75601}{75650}See, he's gotta have|a weakness...
{75656}{75705}because everybody's|got a weakness.
{75711}{75765}I mean, for what?|Pandora, it was the box thing.
{75771}{75832}For the Trojans, hey.|They bet on the wrong horse, okay?
{75838}{75900}We simply need|to find out Wonderboy's.
{75906}{75956}I've done my part.|Get your little imps...
{75962}{76003}They couldn't handle him|as a baby.
{76009}{76070}I need somebody|who can handle him as a man.
{76076}{76115}Hey, I've sworn off manhandling.
{76121}{76171}Well, you know, that's good|because that's what got you...
{76177}{76219}into this jam in the first place,|isn't it?
{76225}{76303}You sold your soul to me|to save your boyfriend's life.
{76309}{76366}And how does this creep thank you?
{76372}{76444}By running off|with some babe.
{76450}{76492}He hurt you real bad,|didn't he, Meg? Huh?
{76498}{76545}Look, I learned my lesson, okay?
{76551}{76604}Which is exactly why|I got a feelin'...
{76610}{76654}you're gonna leap|at my new offer.
{76660}{76729}You give me the key|to bringing down Wonder Breath...
{76735}{76818}and I give you the thing|that you crave most...
{76824}{76889}in the entire cosmos:
{76895}{77005}your freedom.
{77036}{77077}You should|have been there, Father.
{77083}{77128}I mangled the Minotaur...
{77134}{77195}grappled with the Gorgon.
{77201}{77258}Just like Phil told me.|I analysed the situation...
{77264}{77359}controlled my strength|and kicked.
{77380}{77462}The crowds went wild!
{77482}{77549}- Thank you. Thank you.|- Hah!
{77555}{77647}You're doing great, son.|You're doing your old man proud.
{77653}{77699}I'm glad to hear you|say that, Father.
{77705}{77757}I've been waiting|for this day a long time.
{77763}{77823}Hmm. What day is that, son?
{77829}{77900}The day I rejoin the gods.
{77906}{77986}You've done wonderfully.|You really have, my boy.
{77992}{78034}You're just not there yet.
{78040}{78128}You haven't proven yourself|a true hero.
{78134}{78211}But, Father, I've beaten every|single monster I've come up against.
{78217}{78292}I-I'm-I'm the most famous person|in all of Greece.
{78298}{78387}I'm-I-I'm an action figure!
{78393}{78454}I'm afraid being famous|isn't the same...
{78460}{78538}as being a true hero.
{78544}{78575}What more can I do?
{78581}{78655}It's something you have|to discover for yourself.
{78661}{78801}- But how can I...|- Look inside your heart.
{78801}{78884}Father, wait!
{79230}{79275}On your left|is Hercules' villa.
{79281}{79333}Our next stop|is the Pecs and Flex Gift Shop...
{79339}{79411}where you can pick up the great hero's|30-minute workout scroll...
{79417}{79460}"Buns of Bronze."
{79466}{79516}At 1:00, you got a meeting|with King Augeas.
{79522}{79559}He's got a problem|with his stables.
{79565}{79602}I'd advise you|not to wear your new sandals.
{79608}{79661}- Phil.|- I told you, don't move!
{79667}{79713}DGR, the Daughters|of the Greek Revolution.
{79719}{79778}- At 3:00, you gotta get a girdle|from some Amazons.|- Phil.
{79784}{79893}Phil, what's the point?
{79905}{79935}That's it!
{79941}{80024}Keep your toga on, pal.
{80041}{80117}Yuck! What do you mean,|"What's the point?"
{80123}{80156}You wanna go to Olympus,|don't ya?
{80162}{80258}Yeah, but this stuff doesn't seem|to be getting me anywhere.
{80264}{80326}You can't give up now.|I'm countin' on ya.
{80332}{80416}I gave this everything I had.
{80439}{80505}Listen to me, kid.|I seen 'em all.
{80511}{80606}And I am tellin' you...|and this is the honest-to-Zeus truth...
{80612}{80657}you got somethin'|I never seen before.
{80663}{80705}- Really?|- I can feel it...
{80711}{80769}right down in these stubby|bowlegs of mine.
{80775}{80884}There is nothin'|you can't do, kid.
{80889}{80935}- It's him!|- Hey, watch it!
{80941}{80970}- Watch it! Watch...|- I touched his elbow!
{80976}{81043}- Hey, girls!|- I got his sweatband!
{81049}{81100}Phil, help!
{81106}{81185}- Okay. Escape plan: beta.|- Gotcha.
{81191}{81279}- Hey! Where is he?|- There he goes! On the veranda!
{81285}{81368}Whoa!
{81684}{81762}Let's see. What could be behind|curtain number one?
{81768}{81804}Meg!
{81810}{81871}It's all right.|The sea of raging hormones has ebbed.
{81877}{81937}Gee, i-i-it's|great to see you.
{81943}{81987}I-I-I missed you.
{81993}{82049}So this is what heroes do|on their days off.
{82055}{82103}Nah. I'm no hero.
{82109}{82160}Sure ya are.|Everybody in Greece...
{82166}{82246}thinks you're the greatest thing|since they put the pocket in pita.
{82252}{82327}I know, it's... it's crazy. You know, I|can't go anywhere without being mobbed.
{82333}{82390}- I mean...|- You sound like you could use a break.
{82396}{82509}Think your nanny goat would go berserk|if you played hookey this afternoon?
{82515}{82590}Oh, gee, I-I don't know. Uh, Phil's got|the rest of the day pretty much booked.
{82596}{82639}Ah, Phil, schmill.
{82645}{82704}Just follow me out the window,|round the dumbbells.
{82710}{82812}You lift up the back wall|and we're gone.
{82904}{82952}Wow. What a day.
{82958}{83002}First that restaurant by the bay.
{83008}{83087}And then that, that play,|that, that, that Oedipus thing.
{83093}{83189}Man! I thought I had problems.
{83212}{83330}- Psst! Stop foolin' around.|- Yeah. Get the goods, sister.
{83336}{83416}I didn't know that playing hookey|could be so much fun.
{83422}{83482}Yeah, neither did I.
{83488}{83564}- Thanks, Meg.|- Oh.
{83570}{83618}Don't thank me just yet.
{83624}{83680}- Oh!|- Oop. Careful.
{83686}{83730}Sorry. Weak ankles.
{83736}{83834}Oh, yeah? Well, maybe you better|sit down for a while.
{83840}{83934}So, uh, do you|have any problems...
{83940}{83985}with things like this?
{83991}{84059}- Uh...|- Weak ankles, I mean.
{84065}{84130}Oh, uh, no, not really.
{84136}{84225}No weaknesses whatsoever?
{84231}{84295}- No trick knee?|- Uh...
{84301}{84399}Ruptured disks?
{84414}{84530}No. I'm, I'm, I'm afraid|I'm, uh, fit as a fiddle.
{84536}{84662}- Wonderboy, you are perfect.|- Thanks.
{84668}{84754}Whoops!
{84760}{84807}It looks better that way.
{84813}{84908}No, it really does.
{85032}{85080}You know, when, when I was a kid...
{85086}{85186}I, I would have given anything to be|exactly like everybody else.
{85192}{85250}You wanted to be|petty and dishonest?
{85256}{85343}- Everybody's not like that.|- Yes, they are.
{85349}{85425}- You're not like that.|- How do you know what I'm like?
{85431}{85473}All I know is...
{85479}{85638}you're the most amazing person with|weak ankles I've ever met.
{85686}{85724}Oh!
{85730}{85786}Meg, when I'm with you...
{85792}{85894}I-I don't feel so alone.
{85900}{85956}Sometimes it's better|to be alone.
{85962}{86081}- What do you mean?|- Nobody can hurt you.
{86134}{86253}Meg? I would never ever hurt you.
{86259}{86319}And I don't wanna|hurt you, so...
{86325}{86382}let's both do|ourselves a favour and...
{86388}{86501}stop this before we...
{86507}{86597}All right! Break it up!|Break it up! Party's over!
{86603}{86666}- I've been lookin' all over this town!|- Calm down, mutton man.
{86672}{86729}- It was all my fault.|- You're already on my list, sister!
{86735}{86824}So don't make it worse!
{86843}{86906}And as for you, ya bum,|you're gonna go to the stadium...
{86912}{86962}and you're gonna be put through|the workout of your life!
{86968}{87067}- Now get on the horse.|- Okay, okay.
{87073}{87175}- I'm sorry.|- Ah, he'll get over it.
{87274}{87382}Move! Move, move,|move, move, move! Move!
{87483}{87540}Hey, watch it. Watch it.|Watch it.
{87546}{87637}Keep your goo-goo eyes on the...
{87652}{87792}That's it. Next time, I drive.
{87924}{87995}Oh, what's the matter with me?
{88001}{88086}You'd think a girl would learn.
{88092}{88193}{y:i}If there's a prize|{y:i}for rotten judgment
{88199}{88290}{y:i}I guess I've already won that
{88296}{88401}{y:i}No man is worth the aggravation

{91468}{91546}What is the weak link|in Wonderboy's chain?
{91552}{91643}-Get yourself another girl. I'm through.|-I'm sorry. You mind runnin'|that by me again?
{91649}{91711}I must have had a chunk of brimstone|wedged in my ear or something.
{91717}{91815}Then read my lips! Forget it.
{91821}{91926}Meg, Meg, Meg,|my sweet deluded little minion.
{91932}{92041}Aren't we forgetting one teensy-weensy,|but ever so crucial little, tiny detail?
{92047}{92089}I own you!
{92095}{92206}- Oh, oh, I got another horn here.|- You work for me.
{92212}{92267}That kid's gonna be|doin' laps for a month.
{92273}{92343}If I say, "Sing,"|you say, "Hey, name that tune."
{92349}{92454}If I say, "I want Wonderboy's head|on a platter," you say...
{92460}{92502}Medium or well done?
{92508}{92613}Oh! I knew that dame was trouble.|This is gonna break the kid's heart.
{92619}{92692}- I'll work on that.|- I'm sorry. You hear that sound?
{92698}{92806}That's the sound of your freedom|fluttering out the window forever.
{92812}{92902}I don't care.|I'm not gonna help you hurt him.
{92908}{93002}I can't believe you're getting|so worked up about some guy.
{93008}{93062}This one is different.|He's honest and, and he's sweet.
{93068}{93110}- Please!|- He would never do anything to hurt me.
{93116}{93228}-He's a guy.|-Besides, O Oneness, you can't beat him.
{93234}{93337}He has no weaknesses.|He's gonna...
{93343}{93425}I think he does, Meg.
{93431}{93558}I truly think he does.
{94060}{94168}- Hey, Phil, what happened to you?|- Kid, we gotta talk.
{94174}{94242}Oh, Phil, I just had|the greatest day of my life.
{94248}{94324}I, I, I can't stop thinkin'|about Meg.
{94330}{94395}- She's somethin' else.|- Kid! I'm tryin' to talk to you!
{94401}{94443}Will you come down here|and listen?
{94449}{94598}Aw, how can I come down there|when I'm feelin' so up?
{95167}{95194}Gotcha!
{95200}{95258}Ah, very nice.|What I'm tryin' to say is...
{95264}{95322}That if it wasn't for you,|I never would have met her.
{95328}{95380}Oh, I owe you big time,|little guy. I do.
{95386}{95414}Will you just knock it off|for a couple of seconds?
{95420}{95478}Rule number 38. Come on, Phil.|Keep them up there, huh?
{95484}{95552}- Phil, I got two words for ya: duck!|- Listen to me. She's...
{95558}{95593}- My dream come true?|- Not exactly.
{95599}{95642}- More beautiful than Aphrodite?|- Aside from that!
{95648}{95743}- The most wonderful...|- She's a... She's a fraud!
{95749}{95806}She's been playin' ya for a sap!

{96593}{96642}Fine! G...

{96774}{96850}I thought you were gonna be|the all-time champ...
{96856}{96973}not the all-time chump.
{96980}{97086}Jeez Louise,|what got his goat, huh?
{97119}{97163}Baboom. Name is Hades,|lord of the dead.
{97169}{97214}- Hi. How ya doin'?|- Uh, not now, okay?
{97220}{97282}Hey, hey. I only need a few seconds,|and I'm a fast talker, all right?
{97288}{97350}See, I've got|this major deal in the works.|A real estate venture, if you will.
{97356}{97402}And, Herc, you little devil you.|May I call you Herc?
{97408}{97462}You seem to be constantly|getting in the way of it, huh?
{97468}{97526}- You've got the wrong guy.|- Hear me out, ya little...
{97532}{97577}Just hear me out, okay?
{97583}{97646}So I would be eternally grateful|if you would just...
{97652}{97706}take a day off from|this hero business of yours.
{97712}{97756}Jeez, I mean, monsters,|natural disasters.
{97762}{97802}- You wait a day, huh?|- You're out of your mind.
{97808}{97946}Not so fast, because, ya see,|I do have a little leverage|you might wanna know about.
{97952}{98042}- Meg!|- Don't listen, Herc...
{98048}{98096}- Let her go!|- Here's the trade-off.
{98102}{98167}You give up your strength|for about 24 hours, okay?
{98173}{98222}Say, the next 24 hours.
{98228}{98271}And Meg here is free as a bird|and safe from harm.
{98277}{98326}We dance, we kiss, we schmooze,|we carry on, we go home happy.
{98332}{98389}What do ya say? Come on.
{98395}{98437}People are... are gonna|get hurt, aren't they?
{98443}{98488}Nah! I mean, it's, you know,|it's a possibility.
{98494}{98536}It happens 'cause, you know, it's war,|but what can I tell ya?
{98542}{98585}Anyway, what do you|owe these people, huh?
{98591}{98657}Isn't Meg...|you little smoochy face you...|Isn't she more important than they are?
{98663}{98707}- Stop it!|- Isn't she?
{98713}{98774}You've gotta swear|she'll be safe from any harm.
{98780}{98824}Fine, okay.|I'll give you that one.
{98830}{98878}Meg is safe, otherwise|you get your strength right back.
{98884}{98931}Yadda, yadda. Fine print. Boilerplate.|Baboom. Okay? We're done.
{98937}{98979}What do you say we shake on it?
{98985}{99032}Hey, I really don't have,|like, time to bat this around.
{99038}{99081}I'm kind of on a schedule here.|I got plans for August. Okay?
{99087}{99155}I need an answer, like, now.|Going once, going twice...
{99161}{99289}- All right!|- Yes! We're there! Bam!
{99428}{99494}You may feel just a little queasy.|It's kind of natural.
{99500}{99587}Maybe you should sit down!
{99604}{99691}Now you know how it feels to be|just like everybody else.
{99697}{99777}Isn't it just peachy?
{99783}{99835}Oh! You'll love this.|One more thing.
{99841}{99902}Meg, babe, a deal's a deal.
{99908}{99982}You're off the hook.|And by the way, Herc,
{99988}{100036}is she not, like,|a fabulous little actress?
{100042}{100074}- Stop it.|- What do you mean?
{100080}{100177}I mean your little chickie-poo here|was working for me all the time.
{100183}{100270}- Duh.|- You're... You're lying!
{100276}{100390}- Help!|-Jeepers, mister, you're really strong.
{100396}{100489}- Couldn't have done it without you,|sugar, sweetheart, babe.|- No! It's... It's not like that.
{100495}{100610}I didn't mean to...|I-I couldn't... I... I'm so sorry.
{100616}{100748}Our hero's a zero!|Our hero's a zero!
{100759}{100851}Well, gotta blaze. There's a whole|cosmos up there waiting for me...
{100857}{100941}with, hey, my name on it.
{100959}{101090}So much for the preliminaries,|and now on to the main event!
{101364}{101443}Brothers! Titans!
{101449}{101530}Look at you in your squalid prison!
{101536}{101653}- Who put you down there?|- Zeus!
{101659}{101715}And now that I set you free...
{101721}{101802}what is the first thing|you are going to do?
{101808}{101935}- Destroy him!|- Good answer.
{101957}{102096}Crush Zeus!
{102119}{102236}Freeze him!
{102304}{102381}Melt Zeus!
{102387}{102531}Blow him away!
{102561}{102665}Zeus!
{102671}{102709}- Uh, guys?|- Huh?
{102715}{102779}Olympus would be that way.
{102785}{102881}- Zeus!|- Freeze him!
{102887}{102929}- Hold it, bright eye.|- Huh?
{102935}{103047}I have a special job for you,|my optic friend.
{103188}{103273}- Huh? Huh?|- Destroy Zeus!
{103279}{103367}Oh, we're in trouble!|Oh, big trouble! I gotta...
{103373}{103426}My lord and lady,|the Titans have escaped.
{103432}{103475}And they're practically|at our gates!
{103481}{103576}Sound the alarm!|Launch an immediate counterattack!
{103582}{103682}- Go! Go!|- Gone, babe.
{103705}{103795}Huh?
{103872}{104033}- Charge!|- On to battle!
{104249}{104330}Ya windbag!
{104336}{104438}Boom, badda-boom!|Boom, boom!
{104486}{104577}Hercules!
{104583}{104699}Where are you?
{104703}{104770}- What can we do?|- Where is Hercules?
{104776}{104842}Yeah, Hercules will save us.
{104848}{104926}Hercules!
{104932}{105065}Come out! Face me!
{105071}{105149}Oh, what are you doing?|Without your strength, you'll be killed.
{105155}{105220}- Hercules!|- There are worse things.
{105226}{105315}- Run!|- Wait! Stop!
{105321}{105441}- Hey, look! It's Hercules.|- Thank the gods! We're saved!
{105447}{105582}So, you mighty Hercules.
{105709}{105800}- Oh!|- Oh!
{105874}{105962}Easy, horsefeathers.|Whoa! Stop twitching!
{105968}{106064}Listen.|Hercules is in trouble.
{106070}{106178}We've gotta find Phil. He's the only one|who can talk some sense into him.
{106268}{106359}Get back! Blast you!
{106420}{106547}- Ooh! Chihuahua!|- Zeus!
{106553}{106623}Come on! Hurry up!|We're shovin' off here!
{106629}{106718}Phil! Phil,|Hercules needs your help.
{106724}{106778}What does he need me for|when he's got friends like you?
{106784}{106895}- He won't listen to me.|- Good! He's finally learned somethin'.
{106901}{106998}Look, I know what I did was wrong,|but this isn't about me. It's about him.
{107004}{107082}If you don't help him now,|Phil, he'll die.
{107088}{107137}I need more thunderbolts!
{107143}{107246}Uh, Hephaestus has been captured,|my lord. Everyone's been captured.
{107252}{107377}I've been captured.|Hey, hey, watch the glasses.
{107461}{107527}Zeusy, I'm home!
{107533}{107622}Hades! You're behind this?
{107628}{107744}You're correct, sir!
{107777}{107870}Flea!
{107932}{108001}- Hercules!|- Phil.
{108007}{108082}Come on, kid. Come on. Fight back.|Come on. You can take this bum.
{108088}{108203}- This guy's a pushover. Look at him.|- You were right all along, Phil.
{108209}{108288}- Dreams are for rookies.|- No, no, no, no, no, kid.
{108294}{108389}Givin' up is for rookies. I came back|'cause I'm not quittin' on ya.
{108395}{108530}I'm willin' to go the distance.|How about you?
{108553}{108660}Me bite off head!
{108720}{108831}Whoa, baby!
{109097}{109150}Hercules! Look out!
{109156}{109266}Meg! No!
{109435}{109519}What's happening?
{109525}{109610}H-Hades' deal is broken.
{109616}{109683}He promised I wouldn't get hurt.
{109689}{109809}Meg, why... why... why did ya...|You didn't have to...
{109815}{109914}Oh, people always|do crazy things...
{109920}{109978}when they're in love.
{109984}{110075}Oh, Meg. Meg, I... I...
{110081}{110234}Are you always this articulate?
{110248}{110373}You... You haven't got much time.|You can still stop Hades.
{110379}{110453}I'll watch over her, kid.
{110459}{110596}You're gonna be all right.|I promise.
{110620}{110724}Let's go, Pegasus!
{110731}{110785}Hup, two, three, four!|Come on, everybody!
{110791}{110853}- I can't hear you!|- Oh, oh, that.
{110859}{110957}I swear to you, Hades,|when I get out of th...
{110963}{111022}I'm the one giving orders now,|bolt boy.
{111028}{111091}And I think|I'm gonna like it here.
{111097}{111193}Don't get too|comfortable, Hades!
{111199}{111318}- Hercules!|- This ought to even the odds!
{111353}{111481}- Yeah, Hercules! Thank you, man.|- Get them!
{111520}{111567}Whoa! Hey!
{111573}{111692}No! Get him! Not me! Him!
{111709}{111860}Follow the fingers! Him!|The yutz with the horse!
{111984}{112052}- Thank you, my boy.|- Nice horsey!
{112058}{112211}My intentions were pure.|I really was attracted to you.
{112220}{112343}- Throw!|- Ah! Now watch your old man work!
{112349}{112431}Uh-oh!
{112467}{112524}Guys, get your|titanic rears in gear...
{112530}{112605}and kick some Olympian butt.
{112611}{112715}Whoa! Is my hair out?
{113308}{113410}Thanks a ton, Wonderboy. But at least|I've got one swell consolation prize...
{113416}{113519}a friend of yours|who's dying to see me.
{113525}{113590}Meg.
{114280}{114355}Meg.
{114471}{114568}Meg, no.
{115002}{115089}Oh, I'm sorry, kid.
{115116}{115210}There's some things|you just can't change.
{115251}{115335}Yes, I can.
{115388}{115450}We were so close!
{115456}{115522}So close. We tripped|at the finish line. Why?
{115528}{115670}Because our little nut, Meg,|has to go all noble.
{115724}{115783}- Where's Meg?|- Oh. Look who's here.
{115789}{115895}- Wonderboy, you are too much.|- Let her go.
{115901}{116006}Get a grip. Come here. Come here.|Let me show you around.
{116012}{116119}Hmph. Well, well.|It's a small underworld, after all, huh?
{116125}{116213}- Meg!|- No, no, no. Mustn't touch.
{116219}{116281}You see, Meg's running|with a new crowd these days...
{116287}{116367}and not a very lively one at that.
{116373}{116450}You like making deals.|Take me in Meg's place.
{116456}{116582}Oh, hmph. The son of my hated rival|trapped forever in a river of death.
{116588}{116642}- Going once!|- Hmm? Is there a downside to this?
{116648}{116717}- Going twice!|- Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay!
{116723}{116843}You get her out.|She goes; you stay.
{116880}{116959}Oh, you know what slipped my mind?|You'll be dead before|you can get to her.
{116965}{117076}That's not a problem, is it?
{117635}{117685}Oh!
{117691}{117741}What's the matter|with these scissors?
{117747}{117844}The thread won't cut.
{117992}{118050}This is...|This is impossible!
{118056}{118122}You... You... You can't be alive.|You'd have to be a, a...
{118128}{118229}A god?
{118274}{118362}Hercules, stop!|Ya can't do this to me! Ya can't...
{118368}{118442}Fine. Okay. Listen.|Okay, well, I deserved that.
{118448}{118538}Herc, Herc, Herc? Can we talk?|Y-Your dad? He's a fun guy, right?
{118544}{118592}So maybe you could|put in a word with him...
{118598}{118646}and he'd kind of blow|this whole thing off, you know?
{118652}{118764}Meg, Meg, talk to him.|You know, a little schmooze, uh...
{118796}{118920}Get away from me! Don't touch me!|Get your slimy souls off me!
{118926}{118981}He's not gonna be happy|when he gets outta there.
{118987}{119058}- You mean, if he gets outta there.|- Taxi!
{119064}{119106}- If? If is good.|- Taxi!
{119112}{119237}I don't feel so good.|I-I feel a little...
{119752}{119870}Wonderboy, what...|Why did you...
{119876}{120035}People always do crazy things|when they're in love.
{120192}{120284}Whoa! Hey, hey, hey, hey!
{120532}{120590}Three cheers|for the mighty Hercules!
{120596}{120704}Oh, yeah.|Flowers for everybody! Oh!
{120935}{120982}Hercules!
{120988}{121112}Hercules, we're so proud of you.
{121118}{121200}Mother.
{121206}{121279}Fine work, my boy!|You've done it!
{121285}{121338}You're a true hero.
{121344}{121439}You were willing to give your life|to rescue this young woman.
{121445}{121533}For a true hero isn't measured|by the size of his strength...
{121539}{121626}but by the strength|of his heart.
{121632}{121745}Now, at last, my son...
{121751}{121856}you can come home.
{122134}{122279}Congratulations, Wonderboy.|You'll make one heck of a god.
{122436}{122547}Father, this is the moment|I've always dreamed of...
{122553}{122634}but...
{122640}{122754}a life without Meg,|even an immortal life...
{122760}{122866}would be empty.
{122868}{122927}I...
{122933}{122987}I wish to stay|on Earth with her.
{122993}{123095}I finally know where I belong.

{133345}{133417}Hello? Hello?|Am I talking to, what?
{133423}{133545}Hyperspace? Hello, it's me.|Nobody listens.
Boss, um...
Something happened.
What's wrong?
You'll have the item today, just like we agreed.
It's as good as in your hands.
Nothing can go wrong.
You contemptible canine!
Don't call me canine!
Do you know the meaning of patience?
Silence!
As long as dogs are involved, anything can go wrong!
I'll take that as a "no."
Jeez, what a hothead!
Ah... keep the quarter.
I am proud to present this special token...
Only in heaven can a bunch of squeaky-clean angels get awards for being extra squeaky-clean.
And now, our final honoree, voted most-rehabilitated by our heavenly jury...
I wouldn't be caught dead wearing one of those merit badges, eh, Carface?
Hey... shh!
A dog who's lifted himself up from the depths of depravity, who proves that every dog deserves a second chance...
Now I know why they call it eternity.
Everything here takes forever.
Shh! Shh!
Shh! Shh!
Charlie, show some respect.
...for making the most of what he's had to work with, this first-class, diamond-studded angel wing pin goes to...
Carface Carruthers!
What an honor! Ha.
You're too kind.
I don't know what to say!
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Bless you!
I only hope that our other angels...
Who have yet to distinguish themselves...
Soon follow your shining example.
Hey, remember, Charlie, it never hurts to play the game.
Halo polisher.

This is heaven, Itch.
Fleas go to the other place.
Hey, Bubba, how 'bout we go down to hog heaven and get us some ribs?
Ha ha ha!
Everybody's flyin'.
Uh, d-does that mean...
Me, too?
Ha ha ha.
Oh, yeah.
It's all part of the basic package.
I'm going to like it here, Charlie.
Believe me... it gets old fast.
Yeah, sure.
Ha, ha, ha.
Ya! Ooh-ooh-ooh!
Whaddaya mean?
It's hard to explain, Itch.

Charlie, you got to see a doctor.
Heh heh heh.
Heh heh heh.
Unh! Eee! Uhh!
Hee hee!
Ooh... hey!
Ah. Ha ha ha!
Baby...
You're my ticket to fame and fortune!
Aah!
This is not good!
Aah!
Aah-ho-ho!
Aah!
Charlie, you're wrong about this place.
The flying alone is worth the price of admission.
That's perfect for you.
But for me, there's still something missing.
Ooh! Charlie, look.
Look!
Quiet, quiet, quiet, everyone!
I've got terrible news!
Oh, yeah, the flying nun.
Gabriel's horn has fallen from heaven and landed on Earth in the heart of San Francisco.
Oh! No!
This is terrible!
But without the horn, the pearly gates can't be opened.
And no more dogs would get into heaven!
Lucky dogs.
Reginald, you're our most-decorated angel.
I need you to go back to Earth go back!
To retrieve it.
Anabelle, I would consider it a great...
Whoa, time out!
You can't send Reggie.
Look at him, for heaven's sake!
They got rats down there bigger than this.
He's right!
I'll go!
We are talking the mean streets of frisco here, Ace, not mount happy-go-lucky.
Send me, Anna...
Anabelle, you'll need someone who can zip there and back before big Gabe finds his horn missing...
Someone who knows the ropes and the dopes, someone...
Just like you.
Me? Well, I don't know.
I'd have to check with my people and get back to you.
Oh, what the heck?
I'll do it.
Maybe you can do something besides make a nuisance of yourself.
Right, right.
I'll be in touch.
Hold it!
To find the horn, follow your ears.
It gives off a steady, heavenly tone that only angels can hear.
Only angels.
Got it.
Wait, wait, wait!
You're on your own.
I can give you one miracle to be used only in an emergency.
Ooh!
One per customer.
Got it.
Charles, Charles, Charles!
This is serious!
If the horn falls into the wrong hands, it could mean disaster for us all!
You can count on Charles.
Oh, just to make sure,
I'm sending Itchy along with you.
Oh, no! But...
I just got here!
Wait just a sec...
I... I still have death lag!
Whoo!
Yahoo!
I just remembered...
I have flying lessons after lunch!
Bring back the horn, Charles!
Otherwise, there'll be heaven to pay!
Got... it!
Aah! Whoo! Whoo!
Ah ha ha!
Whoo hoo! Whoo hoo!
Look at this mess, Itch.
Trash, exhaust fumes, graffiti!
We are home!
You're tellin' me!
Ha-lo!
Double chili cheeseburger with onions and pickles!
Charlie! Stay!
Look, we find Gabriel's horn and then it's straight back to heaven. OK?
What's the hurry, Itch?
Let's have some fun.
Charlie, wait!
Wiener dog, here.
Oh, my legs are short!
So let's hear it for Kiko and his jazz mongrels.
They're great, aren't they?
I.D.?
I don't need no stinkin' dog tags!
Classy place.
They check for worms.

Maybe it was the change in altitude.
Ooh. My ears popped.
Did your ears pop?
Now I know what I was missing in heaven.
I got to meet her.
She can't see you.
You're an angel.
Quit reminding me.
Heh heh. You're back in circulation, huh, Charlie?
Oh, yeah.
My circulation's fine.
Hello, Carface.
Carface!
Ha ha ha.
I heard you was in the neighborhood.
Yeah. I got time off for good behavior.
What are you doing here?
Missionary work.
Hey. I'll take one of them.
Ha ha ha.
She can't hear you.
That'll be 2 bits, Carface.
Put it on my tab.
As long as I'm wearing this baby
I'm flesh and blood.
Where'd you get it?
A buddy of mine has them.
So, introduce us.
Charlie, you can't trust Carface.
He shouldn't have got into heaven in the first place.
My mistake.
I just thought you'd like to meet the lovely lady.
Hold it, Carface.
Hold on.
What about the horn?
Hey, we'll get it later.
Lead on, pal.
Charlie! Wait!
Short legs, short legs.
Charlie.
Charlie...
Wait for me.
How much further here, Carface?
We're... we're almost there.
Charlie?
Charlie.
Itchy, you're out of breath and the fun hasn't even started yet.
Charlie, I got a bad feeling about this.
Relax.
I got it under control.
Boys, we're here.
Heh heh heh heh.
Hey, Red!
He must be in the back.
Have a look around.
Whoo! Aah!
Ooh hoo.
Ooh hoo hoo.
Whoo aah!
Ooga booga.
Aah!
Ha ha ha ha.
You trying to scare me to death?
Don't sweat it, pal.
You're already dead.
Itch...
Come here.
I want to read your fortune.
I see you going for a long walk.
Yeah... on a short leash.
You're in the wrong seat.
Move it.
Carface...
That's no way to treat customers.
Red, I'd like you to meet a couple friends of mine.
Charlie Barkin.
Itchy Itchiford.
Welcome.
Wait, wait.
How can he...
Red sees all and knows all.
Ah... ahh... ah-choo.
You got cats around here or what?
Cats!
Oh, good heavens, no.
The boys have come to do some shopping.
Carface tells us you've got special collars.
Collars.
Oh, yes.
They're going to be the next big thing.
Here.
Enjoy.
What's the catch, old man?
No catch.
Any friend of Carface is a friend of mine.
There is one small thing.
I knew it!
We're out of here, right, Charlie?
The collars are only good until sundown tomorrow.
After that, you'll be... shall we say...
Insubstantial again.
By then I'll have Sasha begging for me.
Yeow. Hey!
Oof!
Ah. Perfect fit.
Ahh...
Ah-choo!
Feels great to be back in the flesh.
Whoa! Ooh.
How many?
Ah-choo!
Infested again.
Oh! Yeow.
Ooh, get off.
Everybody off!
And don't forget...
Sundown tomorrow.
Zzz... yetty...
Ah-choo!
Jeez.
Jeez...
Hey!
Hey, Red...
I owe you one.
You'll owe me one, all right.
They fell for it!
Ha ha ha ha ha.
When we get that horn, we can open any safe or bank vault in the world.

Oh. What?
You advertised a meal for the winner.
If it's a meal you want,
I'm off at 10:00.
Honey, I'd rather eat out of the garbage.
Hey, uh...
That's what I had in mind.
Huh. Bonsoir, Frenchy.
It's your lucky night.
Pedigree?
You show me yours, and I'll show you mine.
What do you serve with that shake, baby?
This is going to be fast, right?
We got a horn to find.
Ah. Take notes, Itch.
You're about to watch a master.
You must hear this all the time...
But you sing like an angel.
Excuse me.
The name's Barkin...
Charlie Barkin.
And you are?
Not even remotely interested.
Oh. That's a mouthful.
Down boy.
Let me help.
Ah, come on.
Give me that.
No, please.
It's no problem.
Whoops.
Hey, sister.
No free eats.
I'll take care of it.
Put it on Carface's tab.
OK.
Now... where were...
Hey, Charlie...
I noted how you swept the lady off her feet.
So, I'm rusty.
Let's make a little home delivery.
I'll never get back to heaven.
Oh-ho, shucks.
Something tells me you're forgetting about the horn.
Would you take it easy?
There's plenty of time for that. Come on.
Anabelle is not going to like this, Charlie.
Hey.
Nice digs, huh, Itch?
Grrrrrr!
Wow!
You! What do you want?
You left your doggy bag.
Oh, right. Um, thanks.
Thanks a lot.
There's more than enough.
If you want some company, we could stick around.
Sorry, I've got a kid.
Uh, yeah, but, uh...
I'm good with kids.
Whoa. She's got a "kid" kid.
Thanks, girl.
What did he do, follow you home?
Aah!
You can talk?
Please, don't encourage him.
Aah!
He understands you?
Of course he can.
Holy cow!
Holy dogs, actually.
I'm Charlie. He's Itchy.
What's going on here?
And I want the truth.
The truth?
I'm... an...
Angel.
Oh, boy.
Come on.
Somebody's playing a trick.
OK. OK.
If I'm not an angel, how can I do this!
Whew. Wait a minute.
Run, jump, fly?
What did I forget?
Of course.
Watch this, kid.
Aah!
Please...
Hold your applause.
Ta-da!
Wow! That was the best trick I've ever seen.
Trick?
I do magic, too.
Give me the ball, boy.
Wow! That was... that was...
Real... I can't... more.
More.
The kid's good.
Listen...
I could help with his technique.
Houdini.
That little boy is lost.
If you want to help, ask him where he lives.
Charlie, look.
It's a miracle.
Why not ask him yourself?
Now, that would be a miracle.
One miracle, coming up.
Of all the arrogant, presumptuous, egotistical mutts I've ever met.
Now you talk.
You must be an angel.
Hey, Charlie, you used up your miracle, and that was for an emergency.
It seemed like an emergency.
You must be my guardian angel.
Your what?
Your what?
My mom said everyone has a guardian angel.
You're here because
I ran away from home, right?
Uh, sure. Right, kid.
We're going to make some team, huh?
You mean, you're not lost?
Not anymore.
I got my guardian angel.
Hold it.
Why'd you run away?
You tell her.
This ought to be good.
It's, um...
Um, uh...
You're having, uh...
Ha ha...
Kid problems?
Yeah, with my step-mom.
Knew it.
Eh, I knew it.
She wants me to call her mom, but she's not.
I'm never going home again.
Do you plan to live on the street?
Yep.
And do my magic at cannery square.
Tourists give you money.
Now, you know that's silly.
Come on. Tell me where you live.
No!
OK. Don't listen to me.
Listen to your guardian angel.
David, cannery square sounds...
Like a good plan.
What?
Don't listen to him!
He's not ready to go home.
Come on. He's only 8 years old.
That's 56 in dog years.
Who knows where your talent will take you.
Oh, please.
No. You must have faith.
Guardian angels move in mysterious ways.
So we're off to cannery square?
Not cannery square.
Easy street.
Yes!
You with us, Sasha?
I don't know what you're up to, but I'm watching you.
I wouldn't want it any other way.
Charles!
We've got a traffic jam up here.
New arrivals can't get in.
We need that horn.
Put them on a holding pattern.
I'm really onto something here.
Wha... wha... wha...
What?
Ooh. You're going to love this place, boss.
It's got everything you wanted.
Beachfront location, fenced yard, tight security.
The joint's been home to some great pedigrees.
Capone...
Machine-gun Kelly...
The bird dog of Alcatraz.
Oh ho.
All that...
And ratatouille, too.
Then I did good?
Have a bone.
Which way to cannery square?
Uh, just follow your nose.
So, is there a Mr. Sasha?
Nope, and I'm not taking applications.
OK, OK.
But if you were, what, uh...
What qualities would you be looking for?
Oh, I don't know.
Ah, of course you do.
Well...
Loyalty, strength, breeding...
I'd be good at that.
Humility.
Compassion...
And of course, style.
Look out!
Charlie, you OK?
Boy...
Are my ears ringing.
Yeah, you're right.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
That's not your ears, Charlie, that's...
Oh, that's got to be...
The horn.
Look, Charlie...
There it is.
Go get it, Itch.
I'll stay here... with Sasha.
Uh-uh. That's your job.
I'll stay with Sasha.
OK. Be back before you can say hallelujah.
Where's he going?
Um, confidential guardian angel business.
You dogs have enjoyed a state of grace for far too long.
Wouldn't you agree, Carface?
Uh, yeah...
Whatever you say, boss.
All these cells...
Filled with dogs.
Can you see it?
Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure.
And me playing Gabriel's horn!
Can you hear it?
Oh, sure. Just, uh, put your lips together and blow.
And then...
The grand finale!
Oh, um, that ain't, uh, that's not coming in so clear, actually.
Oh, it will.
And all thanks to Charlie Barkin.
Ha ha ha ha ha.
Make sure he doesn't disappoint me.

Nice little dog there.
Get this, Mcdowell.
"Man finds genie in his vacuum cleaner."
Last week you believed that scientists created intelligent lunch meat.
That's why everyone's afraid to ride in a car with you.
Hey, sarge, you got a lost-and-found here?
Room 112 through the squad room.
I'm telling you, Mcdowell, there are some mighty weird things in this world.
Any ideas why he ran away?
It could only be one thing.
We're having a baby, and David got very upset when I told him.
Whoo!
I can't believe this.
Now, where'd I put that lost-and-found list?
Come to Charlie.
Ohh! Duhh!
Of course, it couldn't be Gabriel's flute or Gabriel's kazoo.
No.
Thanks, officer Reyes.
Don't worry. We'll find your little boy.
Itchy, where is he, and what's this all about?
Sorry, can't.
Charlie and I are sworn to secrecy.
My lips... these lips right here...
Well, they're sealed.
Itchy...
Miss me?
Charlie! Ha ha!
So, where's the you-know-what?
Minor setback, Itch.
We're just going to have to bust it out.
It? What it?
Charlie, no.
Well...
Yeow!
Charlie, don't give away the "it."
You ever hear of Gabriel's horn?
All right, here's the plan.
Heh heh heh heh!
Just keep moving.
Doing great.
Act like you belong here.
Just through the door.
I don't think this is going to work.
Nobody even sees us.
No eye contact.
Am I good, or what?
Ho!
Aah!
Don't you... what did you do?
Plan "B," guys.
Doughnuts!
Fresh off the truck!
Doughnuts!
Look out!
Yahoo!
Somebody get that mutt!
Hey! Hey!
Come back here!
Hey! Whoa!
Get over here!
He's headed for the file...
Aah!
Oh, no!
Somebody help me!
Ooh! Ooh!
File this!
Aah!
Ooh!
Oof! Uhh!
Oops. Sorry, officer.
We got you.
OK, son.
Give up the keys.
You heard him, little man.
Nothing up my sleeve, sir.
What?
What?
Officer, what's that behind your ear?
Thank you. Thank you.
You've been a great audience.
Come on!
Mission accomplished.
Come on!
Ooh!
Oh, my gosh.
David!
Uh... uh... David!
Freeze! Sit!
Stay!
What the...
Move! Move! Move!
Stop that kid!
And those dogs!
Kick it, Charlie!
You don't have a license to do that!
Hey! Short legs!
Aah!
It's the dog pound for sure!
Jump, Itch.
Aah-aah!
Aah!
Whoo!
Ooh! Ah! Ooh!
Yahoo!
Wow! Aren't guardian angels supposed to protect people?
Hey, it's my first day on the job.
Aah!
I'm going to barf.
Yee-ha!
Having fun, are we?
Hah!
Aah!
Aah!
Eee, naranja.
Aah!
You finally got your flying lessons, eh, Itch?
I'm going to get you for this, Charlie.
Aw, what do you mean, we're not going back yet?
We got the horn, don't we?
Come on. Let's get out of here.
I still need to take care of David.
I am his guardian angel.
Sure. And Sasha has nothing to do with it.
Well, uh...
Charlie, you're making me crazy here.
Just a little more time.
The horn will be safe here.
No! Charlie!
Wouldn't you rather be home right now, David?
Not that again.
I'm going to cannery square.
Don't you mean... Easy street?
Yeah.
How far is it?
A lot closer than you think.
You nervous?
A little.
And sweaty.
Well, don't be.
Excited?
You bet.
Now, Charlie.
It's OK.
All set.
Let's go.

Come on. Let's get you out of the rain.
One, please.
Thank you.
I'm so hungry, I could eat a shoe.
How about you?
I thought so.
I'll be right back.
My mom used to do that.
Charlie...
Can she see me from heaven?
Of course she can, kiddo.
David, remember, you still have your dad and step-mom.
My step-mom doesn't want me.
She's having her own kid.
Parents can love more than one pup.
Maybe she just didn't know how to tell you that.
Maybe you should give her another chance.
I ran away from home when I was little.
That make your parents sorry?
I don't know. I never saw them after that.
I guess I could have used a guardian angel, huh?
Charlie, I'll go home...
If you promise to take me.
I promise.
Really?
That would be great.
You can sleep on my bed, and we'll play in the yard.
We'll be one big family.
David, hold on.
I can't promise that.
We struck gold!
Egg foo Yung, mu shu pork, wonton, and I hope you like potstickers.
Ha ha! Napkins?
Get... what...
Nice work, Charlie Barkin.
You really are an angel.
No, I'm not.
Not a guardian angel, anyway.
What you did for David was wonderful.
I'm not his angel.
I'm just an errand boy sent to fetch Gabriel's horn.
Sasha, my whole life had been about making and breaking promises.
And now I'm going to do it again.
You can't take him home?
I have to go back.
Just when I finally found someone special.
Oh, Charlie.

Charlie?
Oh, no, no.
Not now.
Sasha! I can't find Itchy.
Where's Charlie?
David, I'm here.
Right here.
He's gone.
He wouldn't leave.
He's my guardian angel.
We got to do something.
They'll be fine, Charlie.
I promised David I'd get him home.
Short legs. Ooh.
I guess I'm short.
Charlie!
Hey, you got any 6s?
Go fish.
Red!
Yaah-ha!
Red. Heh.
I gotta... I gotta ask a favor.
Anything, Charlie.
Just name it.
I need a new collar.
You enjoyed it.
I knew you would.
Oh, thanks.
You're a pal.
Can I have it now?
Oh... I am sorry.
You misunderstood me.
If you want another collar, you must pay.
Oh. Heh.
You caught me a little short.
How about a... an IOU?
I don't think so.
Carface will show you out.
There must be some way to make a deal.
Uh... Charlie.
He, uh, he might take a trade.
Wait. Wait.
Good-bye.
Red?
I have...
This horn.
Sorry.
I'm not musical.
No. This is much more than a horn, Red.
There's nothing like it in the whole world.
Let me sleep on it.
I don't have that kind of time.
I like your spirit, Charlie.
Bring me this horn, and you can have the collar.
Right.
Uh... I need the collar to get it.
Oh, really?
Come on, Red, you can trust me.
This isn't about trust.
A deal with me is binding.
Charlie!
No!
Deal?
Ha ha ha ha!
Aah!
Aaahhh!
Waah-hah!
I guess that cat's out of the bag, eh?
Ha ha ha ha ha!
You tricked me.
Now, be a good little bow-wow...
And fetch me my horn.
Oh! Charlie!
Follow him.
Where are you going, Charlie?
To the train station.
Uhh! Charlie!
Are you nuts?
You... you gave away the horn.
Get out of my way.
You shook on it.
You made a deal with him.
You promised Anabelle.
And you promised me, Charlie.
I know that, but right now, I've got to find David.
Move!
Come on, David.
Which train?
Where's Charlie?
He wouldn't leave me.
David?
David?
Rarrhh!
Aah!
Bring the item to Alcatraz in one hour, or junior here doesn't have a prayer.
Ha ha ha ha!
Charlie!
Where is he?
The hour's up.
You know what they say, boss.
Patience is...
Rrrahhh!
Uh... maybe he's stuck in traffic.
What kind of dog are you, selling out to some mangy old cat?
Quiet, or I'll have your tongue, boy.
Red?
Charlie.
The horn.
Let me, boss.
I'll fetch it for you.
Aah!
Gabriel's horn is finally mine.
Boss, they're hitting the bricks!
Let them.
I have what I want.
Ha ha ha ha hah!
Arrrgh!
Ha ha ha ha!
Silence!
Ah ha ha ha ha ha!
Charlie, what's happening?
Don't worry about it.
Let's get out of here!
Aah!
Aah! Aah!
Ah ha ha ha ha!
Come on! Jump!
Aah!
Charles, what have you done?
Charlie, we got to do something.
No, Itch, it's my fault.
I'm the one who's got to do something...
Get David home safely.
Charlie!
No!
Red, Charlie's coming back!
Heh heh heh heh heh.
That puppy's into punishment.
Oof!
It's a cat's world now!
Aah!
Let him go!
Yaah!
Run, David!
No!
David!
All right, you!
I'm coming!
Aah!
Which do you want...
The horn...
Or your friends?
Itchy! Help us!
Everyone, scatter!
Come back here!
Play the horn, Charles.
The horn!
Charlie!
This should cool him off.
Aaaahh.
Take a bath!
Enough stupid pet tricks!
Aah!
Here, kitty, kitty.
I like your spirit.
Oops! Ha ha ha!
Hope you can dog paddle!
Charlie!
Yaaahhh!
Waaah!
Uh! Uh! Wha...
Ah! Ah! Aah!
Aaah!
Aaaahh!
Ha-lo!
Double chili catburger with onions and pickles.
Everyone OK?
I think so.
I'm fine.
I'm good.
Me, too.
Where's Red?
His boss yanked his leash.
Ah, good riddance.
Ptooey!
Charlie...
I hope you didn't take any of that personally.
I was just, you know, playing the game.
Sure, Carface.
Say, what did you trade
Red for your collar?
He wanted the bottom of my shoes or something.
Ah ha ha! I don't even wear shoes. Stupid cat.
Stupid dog!
It was your soul!
Ah! Let me go!
This is not good.
Yikes! Not the flames.
No, no!
Not the flames.
What do you know?
And I thought all dogs go to heaven.
Anabelle.
Come on, Charlie.
Time to go.
Already?
David... can Sasha take you home?
Charlie...
Don't go.
Hey...
I'll always be your guardian angel.
OK.
Sasha...
I love you.
I love you, too, Charlie.
Hey... what's wrong?
Is this thing stuck between floors?
I'll take the horn from here, Charles.
What? Afraid I'll drop it?
Ooh!
There's someone who still needs to go back where he belongs.
I already took care of David.
Not David.
You, Charlie.
For what you've done, you deserve a second chance.
Claim this in, oh, say...
20 years?
You mean?
Itchy, you hear that?
We're going back!
Nah.
Not this wiener dog.
See, when you can fly...
Short legs don't matter.
Ha ha!
I'm gonna miss you, pal.
I couldn't have done it without you.
Take care of yourself, buddy.
What... what is it, girl?
Can you believe it?
Charlie?
Why, Charlie!
I got a weekend pass...
For the rest of my life.
Oh, Charlie.
David?
Thom, it's David!
Davey!
Ohh, David!
You're all right!
I've been worried sick about you.
You worried about me?
Of course.
Having this baby doesn't mean I don't love you.
I know that now...
Mom.
Honey, we're a family.
That's right.
Just a bigger one.
Dad...
Mom...
Speaking of bigger families...
Do we have room for a pet or 2?
Tell me the truth, Charlie Barkin.
Why'd you really come back?
And don't con me.
Actually, I kind of like the idea of being Mr. Sasha.
Hey, guys!
I worked a little magic!

It's my turn for breakfast this morning, Gromit.
I'd like a three-minute egg...
Oh, steady on.
Whoa, Gromit!
Oh!
Well, that went as well as could be expected, didn't it, hmm?
Though I might have to make a small adjustment to the drop.
A touch painful on re-entry.
Cracking toast, Gromit.
Any post, was there, perchance?
Oh, dear, a bit steep.
Oh, my goodness.
Well, I'll be...
They're all bills.
Oh, dear, oh, dear me.
We shall have to economize, Gromit.
I'll have to let that room out.
Oh, dear.
Oh, just look at that.
I'm down to my last few coppers.
And those presents weren't cheap either.
Well, Gromit, let's see what's on the 9:05, shall we, hmm?
Here she comes now.
I wonder what this can be.
Happy birthday! Chuck!
I knew you'd like it.
Here, let me help you.
You look like somebody owns you now.
And that's only the first part.
Come and look in here.
I think you'll find this present a valuable addition to our modern lifestyle.
They're techno-trousers.
Ex-NASA.
Fantastic for walkies.
All you do is attach the lead on here.
Then program in.
Walkies, 10 minutes,
20 minutes.
Whoops!
Have a nice walk,
Gromit.
Oh...
It's no use prevaricating about the bush.
Nice walkies, hmm?
How were the techno-trousers?
Oh, there's someone at the door, Gromit.
I wonder who that could be.
Oh, it's about the room, then.
Well, that's grand.
Eh, would you like to come this way and inspect?
I'm asking 20 a week.
That would include your breakfast.
I suppose you like kippers, do you?
Partial to a nice black pudding, myself, with bacon, of course.
I'm sure that we can come to an amicable agreement.
As I say, it's a bit dingy at present.
But it's surprising what a lick of paint will do, isn't it?
Oh! But I don't think...
That wasn't quite what we had in mind.
Wouldn't you like to see-
Oh, dear.
Look... there's something
I've got to tell you.
It's, um... no pets.
Does that suit you?
Oh. Seems pleasant enough.
Cheer up, Gromit.
Surprising what a lick of paint will do, isn't it?
Oh.
Oh, so that's where my braces went.
Wonderful things, these techno-trousers.
Oh, oh, I'm sorry.
Lovely morning, Gromit.
Oh!
Thank you very much.
That's just grand.
Oh, thank you kindly.
What do you think of that, then, Gromit?
Eh? Our paying guest.
Nice drop of Bordeaux, this, eh?
Here's to paying guests.
More cheese, Penguin? Eh?
Good night, Penguin.
Sleep well.
Oh.
That was lovely cheese.
Oh-oh-oh. Oh.
Yeow!
It's the wrong trousers.
The wrong trousers!
What have you done with the controls, Gromit?
Now, that'll do.
Just hold on a minute.
Stop it. Gromit!
Stop these confounded things!
This isn't funny, Gromit.
The joke's over.
Get me out of these trousers!
Lovely day!
Help!
Gromit!
Gangway!
Sorry!
Whoa!
It's the wrong trousers, Gromit, and they've gone wrong.
Stop them, Gromit! Stop them!
Help me!
Gromit, the trousers have gone haywire.
Get me out!
Help!
Oh, I'm tired.
A good doze, that's what I need: get me strength back.
What a... what a shocking calami... calami... calamity.
What's the game, then?
Where am I?
What's going on? Yikes!
Gromit!
Gromit!
I must be dreaming.
Where the devil am I?
Oh!
Great heavens above.
Whatever is it?
Help! Get me down!
Help!
What's the game, then? Eh?
Where am I?
That's quite enough.
You'll be hearing from my solicitor about this.
Mind how you go.
You can't go taking liberties like this.
I'm a respectable citizen.
Most definitely not legal, this.
Good grief, it's you!
Now, let me out of these trousers this minute.
Steady on, will you?
This wardrobe's nearly new, you know.
Let me out!
I'll give you what for, you tyke!
Excuse me.
Uh, hello?
I should think so too.
Hey!
Well, this is a fine how-do-you-do, isn't it, Gromit?
Steady on.
Watch where you're putting them paws.
Oh, careful, lad.
Oh, my goodness.
It'll ruin the woodwork.
Oh, there goes me knotty pine.
Where are we going?
I can't see a thing.
What's happening?
Catch me, Gromit.
Don't worry, Gromit!
I'm-whoa- right behind you!
Hang in there, Gromit.
Everything's under control.
I'll have that, if you don't mind, eh?
Tally-ho!
Leave him to me.
I'll get the bounder!
Get him, Gromit!
Gromit, we're doomed.
Mind the table, Gromit!
Gotcha!
Huh?
All yours, Gromit!
Attaboy, Gromit, lad!
Well done.
We did it. Ha-ha!
Thank you, old friend.
Many thanks indeed.
That reward money paid off all our debts.
No more lodgers.
More trouble than they're worth.
I could just fancy some cheese, Gromit.
What do you say?
Cheddar?
Don't forget the crackers.
Ah, all's well that ends well; that's what I say.
Mmm.
Oh, I do like a bit of Gorgonzola.
Morning in Paris
The city awakes
To the bells of Notre Dame
The fisherman fishes
The baker man bakes
To the bells of Notre Dame
To the big bells as loud as the thunder
To the little bells soft as a psalm
And some say the soul of the city's the toll
Of the bells
The bells of Notre Dame
Listen. They're beautiful, no?
So many colours of sound, so many changing moods.
Because, you know, they do not ring all by themselves.
- They don't?
- No, you silly boy.
Up there, high, high in the dark bell tower...
Lives the mysterious bell ringer.
- Who is this creature?
- Who?
- What is he?
- What?
- How did he come to be there?
- How?
- Hush.
- Ow.
Clopping will tell you.
It is a tale... a tale of a man and a monster.
Dark was the night when our tale was begun
- On the docks near Notre Dame
- Shut it up, will you?
- We'll be spotted!
- Hush, little one.
Four frightened Gypsies slid silently under
The docks near Notre Dame
Four guilders for safe passage into Paris.
A trap had been laid for the Gypsies
And they gazed up in fear and alarm
At a figure whose clutches were iron as much as the bells
Judge Claude Frollo!
The bells
Of Notre Dame
Judge Claude Frollo longed to purge the world of vice and sin
And he saw corruption everywhere except within
Bring these Gypsy vermin to the Palace of Justice.
- You, there! What are you hiding?
- Stolen goods, no doubt.
Take them from her.
She ran!
Sanctuary!
Please, give us sanctuary!
A baby?
A monster!
- Stop!
- Cried the archdeacon.
This is an unholy demon. I'm sending it back to hell, where it belongs.
See, there, the innocent blood you have spilt
On the steps Of Notre Dame
I am guiltless.
She ran. I pursued.
Now you would add this child's blood to your guilt
- On the steps Of Notre Dame
- My conscience is clear.
You can lie to yourself and your minions
You can claim that you haven't a qualm
But you never can run from
Nor hide what you've done from the eyes
The very eyes
Of Notre Dame
And for one time in his life of power and control
Frollo felt a twinge of fear for his immortal soul
- What must I do?
- Care for the child, and raise it as your own.
What? I am to be saddled with this misshapen--
Very well, but let him live with you in your church.
- Live here? Where?
- Anywhere.
Just so he's kept locked away where no one else can see
The bell tower, perhaps.
And who knows? Our Lord works in mysterious ways.
Even this foul creature may yet prove one day to be
Of use to me
And Frollo gave the child a cruel name... a name that means
"half-formed."
Quasimodo.
Nowhere is a riddle to guess if you can
Sing the bells Of Notre Dame
Who is the monster and who is the man
Sing the bells, bells bells, bells
Bells, bells bells, bells
Bells Of Notre Dame
Good morning.
Will today be the day?
Are you ready to fly?
You sure?
Good day to try.
Why, if-if I picked a day to fly, oh, this would be it.
The Festival of Fools.
It will be fun, with jugglers and-and-and music and dancing.
Go on. Nobody wants to be cooped up here for ever.
Man! I thought he'd never leave.
I'll be spittin' feathers for a week.
Well, that's what you get for sleeping with your mouth open.
Go scare a nun. Hey, Quasi, what's goin' on out there?
- A fight? A flogging?
- A festival.
- You mean the Feast of Fools?
- Uh-huh.
- All right, all right!
Pour the wine and cut the cheese.
It is a treat to watch the colourful pageantry of the simple peasant folk.
Boy, nothin' like balcony seats for watching the ol' F.O.F.
- Yeah, watchin'.
- Oh, look. A mime.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
What gives?
Aren't you going to watch the festival with us?
- I don't get it.
- Perhaps he's sick.
Impossible. If 20 years of listenin' to you two... hasn't made him sick by now, nothin' will.
But watching the Festival of Fools... has always been the highlight of the year for Quasimodo.
What good is watchin' a party if you never get to go?
Here, get away from me!
Go on, ya bunch of buzzards.
He's not made of stone, like us.
Quasi, what's wrong? You wanna tell ol' Laverne all about it?
I-- I just don't feel like watching the festival, that's all.
Well, did ya ever think of goin' there instead?
Sure, but I'd never fit in out there.
I'm not normal.
Oh, Quasi, Quasi, Quasi.
Do ya mind? I would like to have a moment... with the boy, if it's all right with you!
Hey, quit beatin' around the bell tower.
What do we gotta do?
- Paint ya a fresco?
- As your friends and guardians... we insist you attend the festival.
- Me?
- No, the pope. Of course, you!
It would be a veritable potpourri of educational experience.
- Wine, women and song.
- You can learn... to identify various regional cheeses.
- Bobbin' for snails.
- Study indigenous folk music.
- Playin' Dunk the Monk!
- Quasi, take it from an old spectator.
Life's not a spectator sport.
If watchin' is all you're gonna do... then you're gonna watch your life go by without ya.
Yeah, you're human, with the flesh and the hair and the navel lint.
We're just part of the architecture, right, Victor?
Yet, if you kick us, will we not flake?
If you moisten us, do we not grow moss?
Quasi, just grab a fresh tunic and a clean pair of hose, and--
Thanks for the encouragement, but you're all forgetting one big thing.
- What?
- My master Frollo.
- Oh.
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, dear, yes.
W-Well, when he says you're forbidden from ever leaving the bell tower... d-does he mean "ever" eve r?
Never eve r. And he hates the Feast of Fools.
- He'd be furious if I asked to go.
- Who says ya gotta ask?
- Oh, no.
- Ya sneak out--
- It's just one afternoon.
- I-l couldn't.
- And ya sneak back in.
- He'll never know you were gone.
- And if I got caught.
- Better to beg forgiveness than ask permission.
- He might see me.
- You could wear a disguise.
Just this once. What Frollo doesn't know can't hurt ya.
- Ignorance is bliss.
- Look who's talkin'.
Nobody wants to stay cooped up here for ever.
- You're right. I'll go.
- Oh, boy !
- Oh, hurrah!
- I'll get cleaned up.
- Yea!
- Yes, sir!
- I'll stroll down those stairs.
- There ya go!
I'll march through the doors and--
Good morning, Quasimodo.
Oh, good m-morning, Master.
Dear boy, whomever are you talking to?
My... friends.
I see. And what are your friends made of, Quasimodo?
Stone.
Can stone talk?
- No, it can't.
- That's right.
You're a smart lad.
Now, lunch.
Shall we review your alphabet today?
Oh, yes, Master.
I would like that very much.
- Very well. "A"?
- Abomination.
- " B"?
- Blasphemy?
- "C"?
- C-C-Contrition.
- " D"?
- Damnation?
- " E "?
- Eternal damnation.
- Good. " F"?
- Festival.
- Excuse me?
- F-F-Forgiveness.
- You said "festival."
- No!
You are thinking about going to the festival.
I-It's just that you go every year.
I am a public official.
I must go.
But I don't enjoy a moment.
Thieves and cut purses, the dregs of humankind... all mixed together in a shallow, drunken stupor.
I didn't mean to upset you, Master.
Quasimodo, can't you understand?
When your heartless mother abandoned you as a child... anyone else would have drowned you.
And this is my thanks for taking you in and raising you as my son?
I'm sorry, sir.
Oh, my dear Quasimodo.
You don't know what it's like out there.
I do. I do.
The world is cruel
The world is wicked
It's I alone whom you can trust in this whole city
I am your only friend
I who keep you, teach you feed you, dress you
I who look upon you without fear
How can l protect you, boy unless you always stay in here
A way in here
Remember what
I've taught you, Quasimodo.
- You are deformed
- I am deformed
-And you are ugly
-And l am ugly
And these are crimes for which the world shows little pity
- You do not comprehend
- You are my one defender
Out there they'll revile you as a monster
I am a monster
Out there they will hate and scorn and jeer
Only a monster
Why invite their calumny and consternation
Stay in here
- Be faithful to me
- I'm faithful
- Grateful to me
- I'm grateful
Do as l say
Obey
-And stay in here
- I'll stay in here
You are good to me, Master.
I'm sorry.
You are forgiven.
But remember, Quasimodo, this is your sanctuary.
My sanctuary.
Safe behind these windows and these parapets of stone
Gazing at the people down below me
All my life I watch them as l hide up here alone
Hungry for the histories they show me
All my life l memorise their faces
Knowing them as they will never know me
All my life I wonder how it feels to pass a day
Not above them
But part of them
And out there
Living in the sun
Give me one day out there
A Ill ask is one
To hold for ever
Out there
Where they all live unaware
What I'd give
What I'd dare
Just to live one day
Out there
Out there among the millers and the weavers and their wives
Through the roofs and gables
I can see them
Every day they shout and scold and go about their lives
Heedless of the gift it is to be them
If l was in their skin
I'd treasure every instant
Out there
Strolling by the Seine
Taste the morning
Out there
Like ordinary men
Who freely walk about there
Just one day and then
I swear I'll be content
With my share
Won't resent
Won't despair
Old and bent
I won't care
I'll have spent
One day
Out there
Hmm. Uh-uh. You leave town for a couple of decades... and they change everything.
Excuse me, gentlemen, I'm looking for the Palace of Justice.
Would you--
Mmm. I guess not.
What are you trying to say to me?
That the pants do not--
They fit.
- Ahh!
- Stay away, child.
They're Gypsies.
They'll steal us blind.
All right, Gypsy.
Where'd ya get the money?
- For your information, I earned it.
- Gypsies don't earn money.
- They steal it.
- You'd know a lot about stealing.
Troublemaker, huh?
Maybe a day in the stocks will cool ya down.
Come back here, Gypsy !
- Achilles, sit.
- Hey-- Whoa!
Oh, dear, I'm sorry.
Naughty horse! Naughty !
He's just impossible.
Really, I can't take him anywhere.
Get this thing off me!
I'll teach you a lesson, peasant!
You were saying,
Lieutenant?
Oh, uh-uh.
C-C-Captain!
Ow! At your service, sir.
I know you have a lot on your mind right now, but the Palace of Justice?
- Make way for the Captain.
- Go on, make way !
Make way.
Everybody out of the way.
You, make way for the Captain!
- Make way.
- Make way now.
Come on, boy.
Achilles, heel!
- Stop.
- Sir?
Ease up.
Wait between lashes.
Otherwise the old sting will dull him to the new.
Yes, sir.
Ah, so this is the gallant
Captain Phoebus, home from the wars.
Reporting for duty as ordered, sir.
Your service record precedes you, Phoebus.
I expect nothing but the best from a war hero of your calibre.
And you shall have it, sir.
I guarantee it.
Yes. You know, my last
Captain of the Guard was, um... a bit of a disappointment to me.
Well, no matter. I'm sure you'll whip my men into shape.
Uh, thank you. It's a grea-- uh, tre-- uh, tremendous honour, sir.
You've come to Paris in her darkest hour, Captain.
It will take a firm hand to save the weak-minded from being so easily misled.
- Misled, sir?
- Look, Captain.
Gypsies. The Gypsies live outside the normal order.
Their heathen ways inflame the people's lowest instincts.
And they must be stopped.
I was summoned from the wars to capture fortune-tellers and palm readers?
Eh, the real war, Captain, is what you see before you.
For 20 years, I have been taking care of the Gypsies... one by one.
And yet, for all my success, they have thrived.
I believe they have a safe have n within the walls of this very city.
A-A nest, if you will.
They call it the Court of Miracles.
What are we going to do about it, sir?
You make your point quite vividly, sir.
You know, I like you, Captain.
Shall we?
Oh, duty calls. Have you ever attended a peasant festival, Captain?
Not recently, sir.
Then this should be quite an education for you. Come along.
Come, one
Come, all
Leave your looms and milking stools
Coop the hens and pen the mules
Come, one
Come, all
Close the churches and the schools
It's the day for breaking rules
Come and join the Feast
Of
Fools
Once a year we throw a party here in town
Once a year we turn all Paris upside-down
Every man's a king and every king's a clown
Once again it's Topsy-turvy Day
It's the day the devil in us gets released
It's the day we mock the prig and shock the priest
Everything is topsy-turvy at the Feast of Fools
Topsy-turvy
Everything is upsy-daisy
Topsy-turvy
Everybody's acting crazy
Dross is gold and weeds are a bouquet
That's the way on Topsy-turvy Day
Whoa!
Hey! Are you all right?
I-l didn't mean to.
I-l'm sorry.
Oh, you're not hurt, are you?
Here, here, let's see.
- No, no! N-No!
- There.
See? No harm done.
-Just try to be a little more careful.
- I-l-- I-l will.
By the way, great mask.
Topsy-turvy
Beat the drums and blow the trumpets
Topsy-turvy
Join the bums and thieves and strumpets
Streaming in from Chartres to Calais
Scurvy knaves are extra scurvy on the Sixth of Janu-ervy
All because it's Topsy-turvy Day
Come, one
Come, all
Hurry, hurry
Here's your chance
See the mystery and romance
Come, one
Come, all
See the finest girl in France
Make an entrance to entrance
Dance
La Esmeralda
Dance
- Look at that disgusting display.
- Yes, sir.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, the pièce de résistance!
Here it is
The moment you've been waiting for
Here it is
You know exactly what's in store
Now's the time we laugh until our sides get sore
Now's the time we crown the King of Fools
You all remember last year's king
So make a face that's horrible and frightening
- Make a face that's gruesome as a gargoyle's wing
- Hey !
For the face that's ugliest will be the King of Fools
- Why?
- Topsy-turvy
- Ugly folks, forget your shyness
- Topsy-turvy
You could soon be called
Your Highness
Put your foulest features on display
Be the King of Topsy-turvy Day
Boo!
- Bleah!
- Boo!
- That's no mask.
- It's his face!
- He's hideous!
- It's the bell ringer from Notre Dame!
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Ladies and gentlemen, don't panic.
We asked for the ugliest face in Paris, and here it is!
Quasimodo, the hunchback of Notre Dame!
Everybody
Once a year
- We throw a party here in town
- Whoa!
- Where fools are king
- Once a year
- We turn all Paris upside-down
- Oh, what a king
Once a year the ugliest will wear a crown
- Girls, give a kiss
- Right here on Topsy-turvy Day
We've never had a king like this
And it's the day we do the things that we deplore
On the other three hundred and sixty-four
Once a year we love to drop in where the beer is never stoppin'
- For the chance to pop some popinjay
- Oh!
And pick a king who'll put the "top" in
Topsy-turvy
Topsy-turvy
Mad-and-crazy
Upsy-daisy
Topsy-turvy Day
Quasimodo! Quasimodo! Quasimodo!
- You think he's ugly now? Watch this.
- Quasimodo! Quasimodo! Quasimodo!
Oh!
Now that's ugly!
- Hail to the King!
- Oh!
- Oh!
- Bon appétit!
Whoa!
Where are you goin', hunchback?
The fun's just beginning.
Master!
Master, please.
Help me!
Sir, request permission to stop this cruelty.
In a moment, Captain.
A lesson needs to be learned here.
Don't be afraid.
I'm sorry.
This wasn't supposed to happen.
You! Gypsy girl!
Get down at once!
Yes, Your Honour. Just as soon as I free this poor creature.
I forbid it!
How dare you defy me!
You mistreat this poor boy the same way you mistreat my people.
You speak of justice, yet you are cruel to those most in need of your help.
- Silence!
-Justice!
Mark my words, Gypsy.
You will pay for this insolence.
Then it appears we've crowned the wrong fool.
The only fool I see is you!
Captain Phoebus, arrest her.
Now, let's see. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
So there's ten of you and one of me.
What's a poor girl to do?
- Witch craft !
- Oh, boys. Over here.
- There she is!
- Get her!
I'm free. I'm free.
Dang it.
Whoa!
What a woman!
Whoa!
Find her, Captain.
I want her alive.
Yes, sir.
Seal off the area, men.
Find the Gypsy girl, and do not harm her.
I am sorry, Master.
I will never disobey you again.
- Oh!
- Stand back. Stand back.
Stand back.
He's coming.
Oh, he's hideous. I--
- Maybe over there.
- You, there. Get away.
- Move on, peasant!
- Hmm.
Uh. Oh, you!
Easy, easy.
I-l-l just shaved this morning.
- Oh, really? You missed a spot.
- All right, all right.
J-Just c-calm down.
Just give me a chance to apologise.
For what?
- That, for example.
- You sneaky son of a--
Ah, ah, ah. Watch it.
You're in a church.
Are you always this charming, or am I just lucky?
Whoa!
Candlelight, privacy, music.
Can't think of a better place for hand-to-hand combat.
Ooh! You fight almost as well as a man.
Funny, I was going to say the same thing about you.
That's hitting a little below the belt, don't you think?
No, this is.
Touché. Ohh!
I didn't know you had a kid.
Well, he doesn't take kindly to soldiers.
Eh, I noticed.
Ah, permit me.
I'm Phoebus.
It means "sun god."
- And you are?
- Is this an interrogation?
I believe it's called an introduction.
-You're not arresting me?
-Not as long as you're in here. I can't.
- Huh. You're not at all like the other soldiers.
- Thank you.
So, if you're not going to arrest me, what do you want?
I'd settle for your name.
- Esmeralda.
- Beautiful.
And much better than
Phoebus, anyway.
Good work, Captain.
Now, arrest her.
Claim "sanctuary."
- Say it!
- You tricked me.
I'm waiting, Captain.
I'm sorry, sir. She claimed "sanctuary."
There's nothing I can do.
Then drag her outside and--
Frollo, you will not touch her!
Don't worry.
Minister Frollo learned years ago... to respect the sanctity of the Church.
All right, all right.
I'm going.
You think you've outwitted me... but I'm a patient man... and Gypsies don't do well inside stone walls.
What are you doing?
I was just imagining a rope around that beautiful neck.
I know what you were imagining.
Such a clever witch.
So typical of your kind to twist the truth... to cloud the mind with unholy thoughts.
Well, no matter.
You've chosen a magnificent prison.
But it is a prison, nonetheless.
Set one foot outside... and you're mine.
Frollo's orders.
Post a guard at every door.
Don't worry, Djali. If Frollo thinks he can keep us here, he's wrong.
Don't act rashly, my child.
You created quite a stir at the festival.
It would be unwise to arouse
Frollo's anger further.
You saw what he did out there, letting the crowd torture that poor boy.
I thought if just one person could stand up to him, then w--
Huh. What do they have against people who are different, anyway?
You can't right all the wrongs of this world by yourself.
Well, no one out there is going to help, that's for sure.
Well, perhaps there's someone in here who can.
I don't know if you can hear me
Or if you're even there
I don't know if you would listen
To a Gypsy's prayer
Yes, l know
I'm just an outcast
I shouldn't speak to you
Still, l see your face and wonder
Were you once
An outcast too
God, help the outcasts
Hungry from birth
Show them the mercy
They don't find on earth
God, help my people
We look to you still
God, help the outcasts
Or nobody will
I ask for wealth
I ask for fame
I ask for glory
To shine on my name
I ask for love
I can possess
I ask for God and His angels
To bless me
I ask for nothing
I can get by
But l know so many
Less lucky than I
Please help my people
The poor and down trod
I thought we all were
The children of God
God, help the outcast
Children of
God
You! Bell ringer!
What are you doing down here?
Oh!
Haven't you caused enough trouble already?
Wait.
I-l want to talk to you.
Look, h-he's got a friend with him.
Yeah. Maybe today wasn't a total loss after all.
- A vision of loveliness.
- The one in the dress ain't bad either.
- Hurray !
- Way to go, Quasi!
- Congratulations!
- We knew you had it in ya.
- Got the girls chasin' ya already.
- A-A-Actually, l--
You mustn't run too fast, or she'll get away.
Yes, l-l-l-l know.
That's what l--
Give her some slack, then reel her in.
Then give her some slack, then reel her in.
- Then give her some slack--
- Knock it off, Hugo.
She's a girl, not a mackerel.
Here you are.
- I was afraid I'd lost you.
- Yes.
Well, l, uh--
I have chores to do.
I-l-l-lt was nice seeing you again.
- Oh!
- N-No, wait!
I'm really sorry about this afternoon.
I had no idea who you were.
I-l would never in my life have pulled you... up on the... stage.
- What is this place?
- This is where I live.
Did you make all these things yourself?
- Most of them.
- This is beautiful.
Oh, if I could do this, you wouldn't find me dancing in the streets for coins.
- But you're a wonderful dancer.
- Well, it keeps bread on the table, anyway.
- What's this?
- Oh! No, please! l-l-l--
I-l'm not finished.
I-l-l still have to paint them.
It's the blacksmith.
And the baker!
You're a surprising person,
Quasimodo.
Not to mention lucky.
All this room to yourself.
Well, it's not just me.
There's the gargoyles... and, of course, the bells.
- Would you like to see them?
- Yes, of course. Wouldn't we, Djali?
Follow me.
I'll introduce you.
I never knew there were so many.
That's Little Sophia. And Jeane-Marie,
Anne-Marie, Louise-Marie.
- Triplets, you know.
- And who's this?
- Big Marie.
- Hello!
She likes you.
Would you like to see more?
How about it, Djali?
- We'd love to.
- Good. I've saved the best for last.
Oh!
I bet the king himself doesn't have a view like this.
I could stay up here forever.
- Y-You could, you know.
- No, I couldn't.
- Oh, yes, you have sanctuary.
- But not freedom.
Gypsies don't do well inside stone walls.
But y-y-you're not like other Gypsies.
They are evil.
- Who told you that?
- My master Frollo. He raised me.
How can such a cruel man have raised someone like you?
Cruel? Oh, no.
He saved my life.
He took me in when no one else would.
I am a monster, you know.
- He told you that?
- Look at me.
- Give me your hand.
- Why?
-Just let me see it.
Hmm. A long life line.
Oh, and this one means you're shy.
Hmm. Hmm, mmm, mmm.
- Well, that's funny.
- What?
- I don't see any--
- Any what?
Monster lines.
Not a single one.
Now, you look at me.
Do you think I'm evil?
No! No-No. You-You are kind and good and-and--
And a Gypsy. And maybe Frollo's wrong about the both of us.
- What did she say?
- Frollo's nose is long, and he wears a truss.
Ha! Told ya.
Pay up.
- Oh, dear.
- Chump.
You helped me.
Now I will help you.
But there's no way out.
There're soldiers at every door.
- We won't use a door.
- You mean, climb down?
- Sure. You carry him, I carry you.
- Okay.
Come on, Djali.
- Ready?
- Yes.
- Don't be afraid.
I'm not afraid.
- Now I'm afraid.
- The trick is not to look down.
- You've done this before?
- No.
- Wow, you're quite an acrobat.
- Thank you.
- Whoa!
- Whoa!
- Check the alley !
- This way.
- I hope I didn't scare you.
- Not for an instant.
I'll never forget you, Esmeralda.
- Come with me.
- What?
- To the Court of Miracles.
- Leave this place.
- Oh, no.
I'm never going back out there again.
You saw what happened today.
No. This is where I belong.
- All right, then I'll come to see you.
- Here? But the soldiers and Frollo!
- I'll come after sunset.
- But at-at-at sunset...
I ring the evening mass, a-and after that I clean the cloisters... a-and then I ring the vespers, and--
- Whatever's good for you.
- If you ever need sanctuary, this will show you the way.
- But how?
-Just remember... when you wear this woven band, you hold the city in your hand.
- Keep your eyes open.
- Hurry. You must go.
- Check the alley.
- Yes, sir.
- No one's here, sir.
- No one here, sir.
Check the street.
Hi, there. I'm looking for the Gypsy girl. Have you seen her?
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Easy !
No soldiers !
Sanctuary! Get out!
- Wait! All I want is to--
- Go!
- I mean her no harm.
- Go!
You tell her for me,
I didn't mean to trap her here... but it was the only way
I could save her life.
Will you tell her that?
- Will you?
- If you go. Now !
I'll go. Now, will you put me down, please?
Oh, and one more thing.
Tell Esmeralda she's very lucky.
- Why?
- To have a friend like you.
Hey, hey! There he is!
- Yeah!
- Ooh, wonderful! Bravo! Fantissimo!
- Ooh-hoo!
You ejected that tin-plated buffoon with great panache.
The nerve of him, snoopin' around here, tryin' to steal your girl.
- My girl?
- Esmeralda. Dark hair, works with a goat, remember?
Boy, I do.
Way to go, lover boy !
" Lover boy"?
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Oh, don't be so modest.
Look, I appreciate what you're all trying to do.
But let's not fool ourselves.
" Ugliest face in all Paris," remember?
I don't think
I'm her type.
So many times out there
I've watched a happy pair
Of lovers walking in the night
They had a kind of glow around them
It almost looked like heaven's light
I knew I'd never know
That warm and loving glow
Though l might wish with all my might
No face as hideous as my face
Was ever meant for heaven's light
But suddenly an angel has smiled at me
And kissed my cheek without a trace off right
I dare to dream that she
Might even care for me
-And as l ring these bells tonight
- Eh?
My cold, dark tower seems so bright
I swear it must be heaven's light
You know l am a righteous man
Of my virtue l am justly proud
You know
I'm so much purer than
The common, vulgar weak, licentious crowd
Then tell me, Maria
Why l see her dancing there
Why her smouldering eyes still scorch my soul
I feel her l see her
The sun caught in her raven hair
Is blazing in me out of all control
Like fire
Hellfire
This fire in my skin
This burning desire
Is turning me to sin
It's not my fault
I'm not to blame
It is the Gypsy girl
The witch who set this flame
It's not my fault if in God's plan
He made the devil so much stronger than a man
Protect me, Maria
Don't let this siren cast her spell
Don't let her fire sear my flesh and bone
Destroy Esmeralda
And let her taste the fires of hell
Or else let her be mine and mine alone
Minister Frollo, the Gypsy has escaped.
- What?
- She's nowhere in the cathedral.
- She's gone.
- But how?
I--
Never mind.
Get out, you idiot.
I'll find her.
I'll find her if I have to burn down all of Paris.
Hellfire
Dark fire
No w, Gypsy
It's your turn
Choose me or your pyre
Be mine or you will burn
God have mercy on her
God have mercy on me
But she will be mine
Or she
Will
Burn
'Tention!
Good morning, sir.
Are you feeling all right?
I had a little trouble with the fire place.
- I see. Your orders, sir?
- Find the Gypsy girl.
Ten pieces of silver for the Gypsy, Esmeralda.
Lock them up.
Twenty pieces of silver for the Gypsy, Esmeralda.
Take them away.
Poor miller.
He's never harmed anyone.
Frollo's gone mad.
We found this Gypsy talisman on your property.
Have you been harbouring Gypsies?
Our home is always open to the weary traveller.
- Have mercy, my lord .
- I am placing you and your family... under house arrest until
I get to the bottom of this.
If what you say is true and you are innocent, then you have nothing to fear.
But we are innocent. I assure you.
We know nothing of these Gypsies.
- Burn it.
- What?
Until it smoulders. These people are traitors and must be made examples of.
With all due respect, sir, I was not trained to murder the innocent.
But you were trained to follow orders.
Insolent coward .
The sentence for insubordination is death.
Such a pity. You threw away a promising career.
Consider it my highest honour, sir.
Get him!
And don't hit my horse.
Don't waste your arrows.
Let the traitor rot in his watery grave.
Find the girl. If you have to burn the city to the ground, so be it.
Sir, we have looked every where and still no sign of the Gypsy girl.
I had the entire cathedral surrounded.
Guards at every door.
There was no way she could have escaped.
Unless--
- Oh, it doesn't look good.
- It's hopeless. Absolutely hopeless.
You're tellin' me.
I'm losin' to a bird !
Oh, but that poor Gypsy girl.
- I'm beginning the fear the worst.
- I know.
But now don't you say anything to upset Quasimodo.
- He's worried enough already.
- Yeah, you're right.
- We better lighten up.
- Shh. Shh. Shh. Here he comes.
- Now, just stay calm.
- Not a word .
- Easy does it.
- Stone-faced.
Any sign of her?
Oh, it's a lost cause!
She could be anywhere! ln the stocks, in the dungeon, on the rack! Oh!
- Nice work, Victor.
- No, he's right.
- What are we gonna do?
- What are you guys talkin' about?
If I know Esmeralda, she's three steps ahead of Frollo...
- and well out of harm's way.
- Do you really think so?
Hey, when things cool off, she'll be back. You'll see.
- What makes you so sure?
- Because she likes ya.
- We always said you were the cute one.
- I thought I was the cute one.
No, you're the fat, stupid one with the big mouth!
What are you saying, exactly?
Take it from us, Quasi.
You got nothin' to worry about.
Yeah. You're irresistible.
Knights in shining armour certainly aren't her type.
And those guys are a dime a dozen.
But you, you're one of a kind. Look.
Paris, the city of lovers is glowing this evening
True, that's because it's on fire
But still there's I'amour
Somewhere out there in the night
Her heart is also alight
And l know the guy
She just might be burning for
A guy like you
She's never known, kid
A guy like you a girl does not meet every day
You've got a look that's all your own, kid
Could there be two like you
No way
Those other guys
That she could dangle
All look the same from every boring point of view
You're a surprise
From every angle
Mon dieu above
She's gotta love a guy like you
A guy like you
Gets extra credit
Because it's true you've got
-A certain something more
- You're aces, kid.
You see that face
Ya don't forget it
- Want something new
- That's you.
For sure
We all have gaped at some Adonis
But then we crave a meal more nourishing to chew
And since you're shaped like a croissant is
No question of
She's gotta love a guy like you
Call me a hopeless romantic
But Quasi, l feel it
She wants you so
Any moment she'll walk through that door
For
A guy so swell
A guy like you
With all you bring her
A fool could tell it's why she fell
- For you-know- who
- We notice every string there
You'll ring the bell
You're the bell ringer
When she wants ooh-la-la
And she wants you-la-la
She will disco ver, guy
You're one heck of a guy
Who wouldn't love a guy like you
You got a lot
The rest have not
Gotta love a guy like you
Quasi? Quasimodo?
Esmeralda?
Esmeralda, you're all right!
I knew you'd come back!
You've done so much for me already, my friend... but I must ask your help one more time.
Yes. Anything.
This is Phoebus. He's wounded and a fugitive like me.
He can't go on much longer.
I knew he'd be safe here.
Please, can you hide him?
This way.
- Esmeralda.
- Shh. Shh. Shh.
You'll hide here until you're strong enough to move.
Great. I could use a drink.
Yes!
Feels like a 1 470 Burgundy.
Not a good year.
That family owes you their lives.
You're either the single bravest soldier
I've ever seen or the craziest.
Ex-soldier, remember?
Why is it, whenever we meet,
I end up bleeding?
You're lucky. That arrow almost pierced your heart.
I'm not so sure it didn't.
I knew I'd never know
That warm and loving glow
Though l might wish with all my might
No face as hideous as my face
Was ever meant for heaven's light
Frollo's coming.
You must leave.
Quick, follow me.
Go down the south tower steps.
Be careful, my friend.
Promise you won't let anything happen to him.
- I promise.
- Thank you.
Quick! We gotta stash the stiff.
Oh. Oh, Master. I-l-l-l didn't think you'd be coming.
I am never too busy to share a meal with you, dear boy.
I brought a little... treat.
Oh!
Is there something troubling you, Quasimodo?
- Oh. No!
- Oh, but there is.
I know there is.
I think... you're hiding something.
Oh, no, Master.
I-- There's no--
You're not eating, boy.
It's very good.
Thank you.
Seeds.
What's different in here?
Nothing, sir.
Isn't this one new?
It's awfully good.
Looks very much like the Gypsy girl.
I know you helped her escape!
- But l--
- And now all Paris is burning... because of you!
She was kind to me, Master.
You idiot! That wasn't kindness!
It was cunning!
She's a Gypsy !
Gypsies are not capable of real love !
Think, boy.
Think of your mother.
But what chance could a poor, misshapen child like you have... against her heathen treachery?
Well, never you mind,
Quasimodo.
She'll be out of our lives soon enough.
I will free you from her evil spell.
She will torment you no longer.
What do you mean?
I know where her hideout is, and tomorrow at dawn...
I attack with a thousand men.
We have to find the Court of Miracles before daybreak.
If Frollo gets there first--
Are you coming with me?
- I can't.
- I thought you were Esmeralda's friend.
Frollo's my master.
I can't disobey him again.
She stood up for you. You've got a funny way of showing gratitude.
Well, l'm not going to sit by and watch
Frollo massacre innocent people.
You do what you think is right.
What? What am l supposed to do?
Go out there and rescue the girl from the-- from the jaws of death... and the whole town will cheer like l'm some kind of a hero?
She already has her knight in shining armour and it's not me.
Frollo was right.
Frollo was right about everything.
I'm tired of trying to be something that l'm not.
I must be out of my mind.
Phoebus! Shh.
I'm coming with you.
- Glad you changed your mind.
- I'm not doing it for you.
- I'm doing it for her.
- You know where she is?
No, but she said that this will help us find her.
Good, good, good.
Ah, great. What is it?
- I'm not sure.
- Must be some sort of code.
Maybe it's Arabic. No, no. It's not
Arabic. Maybe it's ancient Greek.
"When you wear this woven band, you hold the city in your hand."
- What?
- It's the city.
-What are you talking about?
-It's a map.
See. Here's the cathedral and the rive r...
-and-and-and this little stone must be--
-l've never seen a map that looks like--
Look, l've lived up in the bell tower for 20 years and l think l know...
- I've been in battles on four continents.
- what the city looks like from above...
- I've got a very good idea what a map looks like and this is not it.
- and this is it!
All right. Okay. If you say it's a map, fine. It's a map.
But if we're going to find Esmeralda, we have to work together.
- Truce?
- Well, okay.
Sorry.
No, you're not.
- This looks like the symbol on the map.
- But what does it mean?
I'm not sure.
I can make out an inscription... but it's going to take a few minutes to translate it.
Yes, well. Or-Or we could just, uh, go down those stairs.
Is this the Court of Miracles?
Offhand, l'd say it's the Court of Ankle-deep Sewage.
Must be the old catacombs.
Cheerful place.
Kind of makes ya wish ya got out more often, eh, Quasi?
Not me. I just want to warn Esmeralda... and get back to the bell tower before l get in any more trouble.
And speaking of trouble, we should have run into some by now.
- What do you mean?
- You know. A guard. A booby trap.
Or an ambush.
Well, well, well.
What have we here?
- Trespassers !
- Spies!
- We're not spies!
- You've got to listen--
Don't interrupt me.
You're very clever to have found our hideaway.
Unfortunately, you won't live to tell the tale.
Maybe you've heard of a terrible place
Where the scoundrels of Paris collect in a lair
Maybe you've heard of that mythical place called the Court of Miracles
- Hello, you're there.
- Where the lame can walk
And the blind can see
But the dead don't talk
So you won't be around to reveal what you found
We have a method for spies and intruders
Rather like hornets protecting their hive
Here in the Court of Miracles
Where it's a miracle if you get out alive
Gather 'round, everybody.
There's "good noose" tonight.
It's a double header.
A couple of Frollo's spies.
And not just any spies.
His Captain of the Guard and his loyal, bell-ringing henchman.
The justice is swift in the Court of Miracles
I am the lawyers and judge all in one
We like to get the trial over with quickly
Because it's the sentence that's really the fun
Any last words?
That's what they all say.
- Now that we've seen all the evidence
- Wait! I object.
- Overruled!
- I object!
- Quiet!
- Dang.
We find you totally innocent
Which is the worst crime of all
So you're going to hang
Stop!
These men aren't spies.
They're our friends.
- Why didn't they say so?
- We did say so.
This is the soldier who saved the miller's family... and Quasimodo helped me escape the cathedral.
We came to warn you. Frollo's coming!
He says he knows where you're hiding... and he's attacking at dawn with a thousand men.
Then let's waste no time.
We must leave immediately.
You took a terrible risk coming here.
It may not exactly show, but we're grateful.
Don't thank me.
Thank Quasimodo.
Without his help, l would never have found my way here.
Nor would l.
After 20 years of searching... the Court of Miracles is mine at last.
Dear Quasimodo.
I always knew you would someday be of use to me.
- No.
- What are you talking about?
- Why, he led me right to you, my dear.
- You're a liar.
And look what else l've caught in my net.
Captain Phoebus, back from the dead.
Another "miracle," no doubt.
I shall remedy that.
There'll be a little bonfire in the square tomorrow... and you're all invited to attend.
- Lock them up.
- No. Please, Master.
No, no.
Take him back to the bell tower.
And make sure he stays there.
The prisoner, Esmeralda, has been found guilty of the crime of witch craft.
The sentence: death!
She is innocent!
The time has come, Gypsy.
You stand upon the brink of the abyss.
Yet even now it is not too late.
I can save you from the flames of this world and the next.
Choose me... or the fire.
The Gypsy, Esmeralda, has refused to recant.
This evil witch has put the soul of every citizen in Paris... in mortal jeopardy.
- Come on, Quasi. Snap out of it!
- Your friends are down there.
- It's all my fault.
- Ya gotta break these chains.
I can't. I tried.
What difference would it make?
- But you can't let Frollo win!
- He already has.
So, you're givin' up? That's it?
These chains aren't what's holding you back, Quasimodo.
Leave me alone.
Okay. Okay, Quasi.
We'll leave you alone.
After all, we're only made out of stone.
We just thought maybe you were made of something stronger.
For justice, for Paris... and for her own salvation, it is my sacred duty... to send this unholy demon... back where she belongs.
No!
Quasimodo!
Sanctuary!
Sanctuary!
Sanctuary!
- Captain.
- Sir?
Seize the cathedral.
Don't worry.
You'll be safe here.
Charge!
Come back, you cowards!
You men, pick up that beam.
Break down the door.
Alone at last.
Citizens of Paris!
Frollo has persecuted our people, ransacked our city.
And now he has declared war on Notre Dame herself!
Will we allow it?
I think the cavalry's here.
Hey, isn't that... Feeble?
- Doofus.
- Phoebus!
Sorry. Sorry.
Harder!
I'm-l'm free! I'm free!
Dang it!
Ready, aim, fire !
Are you sure that's how it works?
Works for me.
Achilles, sit.
Get off me!
Fly, my pretties! Fly, Fly!
Put your backs into it!
Frollo, have you gone mad?
I will not tolerate this assault on the house of God!
Silence, you old fool!
The hunchback and l have unfinished business to attend to.
And this time you will not interfere.
We've done it, Esmeralda!
We've beaten them back!
Come and see.
Esmeralda, wake up.
You're safe now.
Esmeralda?
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
- You killed her.
- It was my duty, horrible as it was.
I hope you can forgive me.
There, there, Quasimodo.
I know it hurts, but now the time has come... to end your suffering forever.
Now, now. L--
- Listen to me, Quasimodo.
- No! You listen!
All my life, you have told me that the world is a dark, cruel place.
But now l see that the only thing dark and cruel about it is people like you.
- Quasimodo?
- Esmeralda!
- She lives.
- No!
Leaving so soon?
Look! Up there.
Hang on!
I should have known you'd risk your life to save that Gypsy witch... just as your own mother died trying to save you.
- What?
- Now l'm going to do... what l should have done
20 years ago!
- Whoa!
- Whoa! Oh!
Hold on. Hold on.
And He shall smite the wicked... and plunge them into the fiery pit!
Quasimodo! Quasi!
No!
Three cheers... for Quasimodo!
So here is a riddle to guess if you can
Sing the bells Of Notre Dame
What makes a monster and what makes a man
Sing the bells, bells bells, bells
Whatever their pitch you can feel them bewitch you
The rich and the ritual knells
Of the bells
Of Notre
Dame
Don't you ever migrate?
Someday
When we are wiser
When the world's older
When we have learned
I pray
Someday we may yet live
To live
And let live
Someday
Life will be fairer
Need will be rarer
And greed will not pay
Godspeed
This fine millennium
On its way
Let it come someday
Someday
Our fight will be won then
We'll stand in the sun then
That bright afternoon
Till then
On days when the sun is gone
We'll hang on
And we'll wish
Upon the moon
Whoa-oh
-And some days are dark and dreary
- Dark and dreary
- Seems we haven't got a prayer
- Haven't we got but a prayer
But a prayer for something better
Is the one thing we all share
- Someday
- Someday
- When we are wiser
- When we are wiser
- When the world's older
- When the world is older
- When we have learned
- When we have learned
- I pray someday we may yet
- l pray
- Let live
- Live
Let live
- To live
- To live, to live, to live, to live
-And let live
-And let live
Someday
- Life will be fairer
- Life will be fairer
- Need will be rarer
- Need will be rarer
- Greed will not pay
- No, no, no
- Godspeed
- Godspeed
This fine millennium
Let it come
Wish upon
A moon
One day
Someday
Soon
- One day
- Someday
Someday
Soon
Good night, everybody!

No, no, no.
Oh, no. Oh, no.
I'm lost !
Where's the line ?
Itjust went away.
What do I do ?
- Help !
- We'll be stuck here forever !
Do not panic.
Do not panic !
We are trained professionals.
Now, stay calm.
We are going around the leaf.
A-Around the leaf?
I don't think we can do that.
Oh, nonsense. This is nothing compared to the twig of'93.
- [ Whimpering ]
- That's it. That's it. Good !
You're doing great !
There you go. There you go !
Watch my eyes.
Don't look away.
- And here's the line again.
- Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Soil.
[ Laughing ]
Good job, everybody !
Oh, my.
There's quite a gap, Mr. Soil.
- Shouldn't we tell the queen ?
- I don't think we need to involve the queen in this.
She's got enough on her plate already, training her daughter.
Oh, yes.
Princess Atta, the poor dear.
Oh, wind's died down.
They'll be here soon.
-Just be confident, dear.
You'll be fine.
- [ Gasps ] There's a gap.
There's a gap in the line.
What are we gonna do ?
It's okay, Your Highness. Gaps happen.
We just lost a few inches, that's all.
Oh. Right.
Your Highness, I can't count when you hover like that.
Oh, of course.
I'm sorry. Go ahead.
- Guys, go shade someone else for a while.
- [ Pet Chirps ]
Okay, Atta.
Now what do we do ?
Ahh-- Oh ! Don't tell me.
I know it. What is it ?
- We relax.
- [ Chuckles ] Right.
Oh, it'll be fine.
It's the same, year after year.
They come, they eat, they leave.
That's our lot in life.
It's not a lot, but it's our life.
[ Laughs ]
[ Chuckles ]
Isn't that right, Aphie ?
Oh, you're such a cute little aphid.
[ Rumbling ]
- Ditch Dot !
- Yeah, yeah !
Hey, come back here !
[ Strains, Grunts ]
- Dot.!
- Yes, Mother.
What did I tell you about trying to fly ?
Not until my wings grow in.
- Right.
- But Mom--
Dot, you're a young queen ant and your wings are too little--
I was talking to Mother.
You're not the queen yet, Atta.
Now, Dot, be nice to your sister.
It's not my fault she's so stressed out.
[ Sighs ]
I know, I know.
- I'm always acting like the sky is falling.
- Look out.!
- Atta !
- Princess Atta !
- Oh !
- Hey !
-Stop that.!
- What do you think you're doing?
- You could have killed somebody over here.
- [ Gasps ] I'm sorry !
- Oh, it's Flik.
- Oh--
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry !
- Please forgive me. I'm sorry !
- [ Coughing ]
- [ Screams ] Princess Atta !
- Flik, what are you doing ?
Oh, this ! This is my new idea for harvesting grain.
No more picking individual kernels.
You cut down the entire stalk !
- We don't have time for this.
- Exactly ! We never have time to collect food for ourselves.
We spend all summer harvesting for the offering.
- But my invention will
speed up production.
- Oh, another invention ?
Something for you too.
Since you're gonna be queen, you could use this to oversee production.
- Dr. Flora, if I may.
- This is all very nice, but--
-Just an ordinary blade of grass and a bead of dew, right ?
- Flik, please.
- Wrong ! It is, in fact, a telescope.
- [ Both Laugh ]
- It's very clever, Flik, but--
- Hello, Princess ! Aren't you looking lovely this morning !
Not that you would need a telescope to see that.
Listen ! The princess doesn't have time for this !
You wanna help fill this thing ?
Get rid of that machine, get back in line and pick grain like everybody else !
- Like everybody else !
- Please, Flik.Just go.
I'm sorry,
I was really just trying-- trying to help.
Harvester. Why, we harvested
the same way ever since I was a pupa.
[ Sighs ]
Where were we ?
- The food pile, Your Highness.
- Oh,yes,yes.
Hey, Flik ! Wait up !
Oh. Hello, Princess.
You can call me Dot.
Here, you forgot this.
Thanks. You can keep it.
I can make another one.
- I like your inventions.
- Really ? Well, you're the first.
- I'm beginning to think nothing I do works.
- This works.
Great. One success.
[ Sighs ]
- I'm never gonna make a difference.
- Me, neither.
I'm a royal ant and I can't even fly yet. I'm too little.
- Being little's not such a bad thing.
- Yes, it is.
- No, it's not.
- Is too !
- Is not. Is not ! Is not !
- Is too. Is too ! Is too !
Oh ! A seed.
I need a seed. Ahh--
Ohh !
Ah, here, here.
Pretend-- pretend that that's a seed.
- It's a rock.
- I know it's a rock.
But let's just pretend for a minute it's
a seed. We'll just use our imaginations.
Now, do you see our tree ?
Everything that made that giant tree... is already contained inside this tiny little seed.
All it needs is some time, a little bit of sunshine and rain, and... voila !
This rock will be a tree ?
Seed to tree. You've gotta work with me, all right ?
You might not feel like you can do much now, but that's just because, well, you're not a tree yet.
You just have to give yourself some time. You're still a seed.
But it's a rock.
I know it's a rock !
Don't ya think I know a rock when I see a rock ? I've spent a lot of time around rocks !
You're weird, but I like you.
[ Horn Sounds ]
[ Gasps ] They're here.
- [ Gasping ]
- [ Horn Continues ]
[ Panicked Chattering ]
- They're coming !
- Run !
- Dot ! Dot !
- Mom !
- Mom !
- Thank heavens !
- Food to the offering stone.
- [ Whistles ] Everyone, single file.
Food to the offering stone and into the anthill. Now let's go !
Go, go, go, go !
Come on, keep movin', keep movin' !
Good. [ Panting ]
Okay. That's everyone.
[ Flik ]
Hey.!
Hey, wait for me !
Get the food to the offering stone, then into the anthill.
[ Screams ]
No ! No, no, no, no, no !
Oh, oh !
Oh, no.
Princess Atta !
Princess Atta !
Princess Atta !
[ Rumbling ]
[ Whimpering ]
They come, they eat, they leave.
They come, they eat, they leave.
Excuse me, pardon me.
Pardon me, excuse me. Coming through.
Sorry. Coming through. Princess Atta, there's something I need to tell you.
- Not now, Flik. Shh !
- But Your Highness, it's about the offering !
-[ Rumbling Stops ]
-[ Male Voice ] Hey, what's goin'on ?
Yeah, where's the food?
[ All Gasp ]
- What did you do ?
- It was an accident ?
[ Laughs Maniacally ]
Boo !
[ Laughs ]
- Where's the food ?
- [ Whimpering ]
- Hopper.
- [ Gasps ]
So, where is it ?
Where's my food ?
- l-l-Isn't it up there ?
- What ?
- The food was in a leaf sitting on top--
- Excuse me.
Are you sure it's not up there ?
- Are you saying I'm stupid ?
- No.
Do I look stupid... to you ?
Let's just think about the logic, shall we? Think about it for a second.
If it was up there, would I be coming down here, to your level, looking for it ?
- Uh, l--
- Why am I even talking to you ?
You're not the queen.
You don't smell like the queen.
Sh-She's learning
to take over for me, Hopper.
Oh, I see. Under new management.
So it's your fault.
No, it wasn't me, it was--
Uh-uh-uh. First rule of leadership:
Everything is your fault.
- But-But l--
- It's a bug-eat-bug world out there, Princess, one of those circle-of-life kind of things.
Now, let me tell you
how things are supposed to work.
The sun grows the food, the ants pick the food, the grasshoppers eat the food--
And the birds eat the grasshoppers.
Hey, like the one that nearly ate you, you 'member ? Oh, you shoulda seen it.
This blue jay has him halfway down his throat, and Hopper's kickin' and screamin'.
And I'm scared.
I'm not goin'anywhere near, okay?
Aw, come on.
It's a great story. Ow, ow, ow.
I swear, if I hadn't promised
Mother on her deathbed... that I wouldn't kill you,
I would kill you.
- And believe me, no one appreciates that more than I do.
- Shut up !
I don't want to hear another word out of you while we're on this island.
- Do you understand me ?
- [ Whimpers ]
- I said, do you understand me ?
- How can I answer ? You said
I couldn't say another word.
- Remember Ma !
- [ Growls ]
Hey, I'm a compassionate insect.
There's still a few months till the rains come, so you can all just try again.
But, Hopper, since it's
almost the rainy season, we need this time to gather food for ourselves.
Listen, if you don't keep your end of the bargain, then I can't guarantee your safety.
And there are insects out there that will take advantage of you.
Someone could get hurt.
[ Snaps Fingers ]
[ Screeching ]
[ Snarling, Screeching ]
[ Gasps, Squeals ]
What's the matter ?
You scared of grasshoppers ?
[ Whimpering ]
- Dot !
- You don't like Thumper ?
- [ Snarls ]
- Leave her alone !
You want her ?
Go ahead-- take her.
No ?
Then get back in line.
It seems to me that you ants are forgetting your place.
So let's double the order of food.
- [ Gasps ]
- No ! But-But--
We'll be back at the end of the season, when the last leaf falls.
You ants have a nice summer.
Let's ride !
- Yee-ha !
- [ Grasshoppers Shouting ]
[ Laughing ]
Ooh !
[ Chuckles Nervously ]
Flik, what do you have to say for yourself?
Sorry. l-- I'm sorry for the way I am.
I didn't mean for things to go so wrong.
I especially didn't want to make you look bad, Princess.
- Well, Flik, ya did.
- I was just trying to help.
- Then help us-- don't help us.
- Help, help. Help?
Flik, you are sentenced to one month digging in the tunnels.
Excuse me, Your Highness.
Need I remind you of Flik's tunnel-within-a-tunnel project ?
Helpers to help us.
That's it ! We could--
It took two days to dig him out.
Send him to Health and Ant Services.
Heavens, no !
We could leave the island, the river bed's dry.
We could walk across and get helpers.
We could ! We could go find helpers to help us.
- It's perfect !
- Perfect ? What's so perfect ?
Your Highness, don't you see ?
We could send someone to get help !
- [ All Gasp ]
- Leave the island ?
Why didn't I think of that ?
Oh ! Because it's suicide !
-She's right! We never leave the island.
-Never leave !
There's snakes and birds and bigger bugs out there !
Exactly ! Bigger bugs !
We could find bigger bugs to come here and fight... and forever rid us of Hopper and his gang !
- Ludicrous!
- Who would do a crazy thing like that?
- I'll volunteer.
I'd be happy to volunteer.
- [ Laughing ]
You got a lot of spunk, kid, but no one's gonna help a bunch of ants.
At least we could try. I could travel to the city ! I could search there !
If you went, you'd be on that silly search for weeks.
Royal huddle.
- Great idea, Princess. It's perfect !
- Exactly.
- Wait a minute.
What did we just decide here ?
- To let Flik leave.
While we keep harvesting to meet Hopper's demands.
- You see, with Flik gone, he can't--
- He can't mess anything up !
Flik, after much deliberation, we have decided to grant you your request.
- Really ?
- Really ?
- Uh, really.
Oh, thank you, Princess.
Thank you so much for this chance.
- I won't let you down,
I promise, I promise, I promise.
- That's fine. No, forget it.
- I should help repair the damage before I go.
- [ All ] No ! No, no !
[ Elderly Ant ]
Just leave.!
[ Breathes Deeply ]
Hey.
Don't worry !
The colony is in good hands !
Bye, now.
[ Ants Cheering ]
All right.
Hey, fellas.
Beautiful mornin', huh ?
My dad gives you one hour before you come back crying.
Does he, now ?
- My dad doesn't think that.
- He doesn't, huh ?
- Naw, he's bettin' you're gonna die.
- Oh.
He says if the heat doesn't get ya, the birds will.
I think he's gonna make it.
-Nobody asked you, Your Royal Shortness.
-Yeah, Dot. What do you know?
Hey, hey, hey.
Ease up. Come on.
She's entitled to her opinion too.
[ Gasps ]
[ Birds Cawing ]
Ohh.
- So go, already.
- [ Exhales ]
- Hey !
- The city's that way.
- I know.
- You're supposed to look for bugs, not dandelions.
You leave him alone.
He knows what he's doing.
That's right.
Here I go. For the colony, and for oppressed ants everywhere !
Whoa-oh.
- Wow !
- Hey.!
- Hey-hey !
- Bye, Flik !
Wow !
[ Chuckling ]
Wow. Ohh !
Whoa !
[ Dot ]
Good luck, Flik !
Bye ! Whoa-oh !
Flik !
[ Muffled ]
I'm... okay !
- Your dad's right. He's gonna die.
- You just watch.
He's gonna get the bestest, roughest bugs you've ever seen !
[ Growls, Roars ]
Get back ! Get back !
Get back, you horrible beast !
- [ Roaring ]
- I have no fear ! Aye-eee !
- Ooh !
- Oh, my goodness.
- [ Sobbing ]
- Oh, no !
[ Crowd Boos, Hisses ]
- Oh, I'm so sorry, Dim. An owie ?
- Owie ! Owie, owie.
Please show Rosie the owie.
All right, Dim. It's okay.
I have been in outhouses that didn't stink that bad.
This is ridiculous.
What a disappointment !
- Oh, no!
- You! Come here! I want my money back!
Uh, no refunds after the first two minutes.
Popcorn ! Stale popcorn !
We're losin' the audience !
You clowns get out there now !
- I hate performing on an empty stomach!
- Do your act, Heimlich.
- Then you can eat. Not now, Slim.
- P.T., what's the point ?
What's the point of going out there ?
They'll only laugh at me.
- That's because you're a clown !
- No, it's because I'm a prop !
You always cast me as the broom, the pole, the stick, a splinter.
You're a walkingstick.
It's funny !
- Now go !
- You parasite.
Tra-la-la-la-la.
Spring's in the air.
And I'm a flower with nothing interesting to say.
- [ Screams ]
- A bee !
I am a cute little bumblebee !
Here I come !
[ Screams ]
Slow down, you flowers !
[ Groans ]
Candy corn ! Here, let me help you to finish it.
Hey, cutie ! Wanna pollinate with a real bug ? [ Laughs ]
Ooh, come to papa.!
So, bein' a ladybug automatically makes me a girl, is that it, flyboy ? Huh ?
- She's a guy !
- Francis, leave them alone.
- They are poo-poo heads !
- Not again.
Judging by your breath, you must have been buzzin' around a dung heap all day.
- Come on, Francis.
You're making the maggots cry.
- [ Wailing ]
** [ Vocalizing ]
All right, we're dyin' out there.
Gypsy, quick ! You and Manny--
- Shh ! He's in a trance.
- [ Humming ]
Well, get him out of it !
You and your husband are up now.
Manny, we're on.
Oh ? Yet again it is up to me to rescue the performance.
- Gypsy, come.
- ** [ Humming ]
[ Crashing ]
- The stage is the other way, dear.
- Yes, of course.
Anytime, pal !
- I'm gonna pick the hairs out of your head one by one !
- Take your best shot !
- You name the place !
- Oh, yeah ?
- Yeah, 'cause when you get there, you are dead !
- Francis, let me handle this.
- That's no way to speak to a lady.
- I heard that, you twig.
Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to present Manto the Magnificent... and his lovely assistant, Gypsy !
From the most mysterious regions of uncharted Asia,
I give you the Chinese Cabinet... of Metamorphosis !
Rosie, whole troupe.
Onstage ! Finale ! Now !
- Okay, I just need time to--
Coming, coming.
- Now.!
Tuck, Roll, let's get moving, guys.
We're up next.
[ Speaking Foreign Language ]
Don't you understand ?
We are up !
- " Up-a."

- Hey !
- Hey ! They don't understand me.
I summon the voice of Confucius--
Get off the stage,
you old hack.!
[ Shrieks ]
I demand to know who said that !
- [ Laughing ]
- How dare you !
Ingrates !
[ Gypsy ]
Manny? Manny.!
I only got 24 hours to live and I ain't gonna waste it here.
Come on.
[ Screams ] I've just about had it with these losers !
Flaming death !
I hold in my hand the match-- the match that decides whether two bugs live or die this very evening.
In a moment, I will light
this trail of matches...
leading to a sheet offlypaper
dowsed in lighter fluid.!
Aimed directly at the flypaper are Tuck and Roll,
the pill bug cannonballs.!
The cannon
will be triggered by Dim,
trained tojump
at the sound of this bell...
set to go off in 15 seconds.
Our pill bugs'only hope
of survival is... our mistress of the high wire, Rosie !
Secured to a web line
of exact length,
Rosie will plummet down
to these two posts, spinning a web of safety in less than 15 seconds !
Not good enough, you say ?
Well, what if they were all... blindfolded !
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I suggest that those of you... with weak constitutions leave the arena,
- for this act is so dangerous...
- [ Bickering ] that if the slightest thing should go wrong--
- No !
- Go ? Okay, through the tunnel--
- Whoa !
- [ Bell Dings ]
- [ Chuckling ]
- Whoa !

- P.T. !
- Oh, no !

Get me outta here !
Oof!

- You're all fired.
- We got the water !
- Here we come, P.T. !
Whoo ! Whoa !
Burn 'im again !
No, Harry, no !
Don't look at the light !
I can't help it !
It's so beautiful !
[ Screams ]
Try not to look like a country bug.
Blend-- blend in.
[ Male Voice ]
Hey, buggy.!
What do you expect ?
The guy's a tick.
Wow.! The city.!
[ Laughing ]
Wow !
Whoa-whoa-whoa !
Making all stops to the septic tank,
including standing water, empty bean can and dead rat.
- Watch your stingers. All aboard.!
- Whoa !
- Hey ! Oh, sorry.
- Get out of the way !
- Watch where you're goin' !
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that.
- [ Violin Sound ]
- [ Gasps ] Oh, sorry !
Oh. I'm really, really sorry.
That was an-an-an ac-ac-accident.
- Hey, let go of me !
- I'll show ya who's tough !
- And stay out !
- Tough bugs !
- I knew an old lady who swallowed a fly--
- Wow !
- Move it !
- Whoa !
[ Male Fly ]
Hey, waiter.! I'm in my soup.!
I've been workin'out.
Feel my wing.
Yo !
Two Black Flags over here !
- All right.
- Hair of the dog you bit.
Hey, who ordered the pu-pu platter ?
Here ya go, slick. Enjoy.
Ow ! Aah !
Hey, I said no salt !
Pardon me, sir.
I represent a colony of ants, and I'm looking for tough bugs, you know, mean bugs--
Fired by a flea-- how humiliating !
Let's face it: We stink.
- You fired !
- You fired !
- Oh, will you shut up ?
- You fired !
Someday I will be a beautiful butterfly, and then everything will be better.
I can't believe the troupe is breaking up. We've always been together.
- Farewell, my friends.
- To the audience we'll never have.
[ Gasps ] Francis ! Your boyfriends from the circus are here !
- [ Gasps ]
- There she is.
- Hello there, girly bug.
- Shoo, fly. Don't bother me.
Say, why don't you tell our pal, Thud,
- what you said to us at the circus.
- Yeah.
- Somethin' about buzzin' around a dung heap ?
- [ Growls ]
Excuse me. Hi. I represent an ant colony, and we're--
Hey, bartender !
Bloody Mary, O-positive.
Aha !

- Sir ?
* Ladybug, ladybug fly away home *

- Not so tough now, are you ?
All right, clown.
Get up and fight like a girl.
- Get ready to do the Robin Hood act.
- I want to be LittleJohn !
- What part can I play ?
- You see, I'm looking for tough, warrior bugs.
Stand back,ye flies.! We are
the greatest warriors in all bugdom.!
- Warrior bugs !
- My sword !
Swish, swish. Clang, clang.
- LittleJohn ?
- What ho, Robin ?
Justice is my sword and truth shall be my quiver !
Wait, wait ! No, no !
I want to watch this !
-Jawohl.!
- Thrust, parry, lunge !

- Me thinketh it's not working !
[ Gasps ]
Back to Sherwood Forest !
- Schnell ! Schnell !
- What's going on in there ?
[ All Screaming ]
Help ! Help ! Get me out !
[ Grunting ]
Wow.
- Oh, ow-ow-ow-ow.
-[ Flik ] You're perfect.!
Oh, great ones ! I have been scouting for bugs with your exact talents !
- [ Gasps ] A talent scout.
- My colony's in trouble.
Grasshoppers are coming ! We've been forced to prepare all this food.
- Dinner theater !
- Food ?
Please !
Will you help us ?
- [ Growling ]
- Where are they ?
- We'll take the job !
- Really ?
- Yes, yes, yes !
You can explain the details on the way.
Hey !
[ Chattering ]
- Okay, come on, everyone. Break a leg !
- Whoa, you're vicious !
Hold on, Mr. Ant.
Amazing !
This is too good to be true !
[ Laughs ]
Ooh !
So, you see, it was my fault that Hopper's coming back.
But then, Princess Atta-- boy, is she one in a million-- she let me go out and find you.
And after seeing you fight off those flies--
Boy, are those grasshoppers in for a surprise !
[ Laughing ]
[ Laughing ]
[ Chattering In
Foreign Language ]
[ Grunts ]
[ Moans ]
- Dr. Flora !
- Oh, dear. Not another one.
- This is insane.
- Insane.
There's just not enough food left on the island !
No way we can make double quota before Hopper comes.
Well, we have to try, Thorny.
We don't have any choice.
Yeah, I know.
Hey, look who's playing
lookout again--little Speck.!
- The name is Dot.
- Well, Spot, still lookin' for Flik ?
Forget it, Dot.
That loser's never coming back.
Flik.!
He did it.! He did it.!
What ? Quit shoving !
This is it !
This is Ant Island !
Flik ! Over here !
Flik ! Flik !
- Hey !
- He did it ! He did it ! Yea !
- He did it !
- Cool ! [ Screams ]
At the rate these leaves are dropping, we're gonna need a miracle.
That's right !
We need a miracle !
- Run for your lives !
- [ Anxious Chattering ]
Ta-da !
[ Bird Cawing ]
[ Sighing ] Once again, our reputation precedes us.
Hey, everybody !
Hey ! I'm back !
Hey, guys.! Hey-ey.!
Look-look-look who's here with me.!
Flik ! Flik ! Flik ! You're back !
I knew you could do it !
- Flik ?
- It's Flik !
[ Chattering ]
- Flik has returned !
- He's back ?
And he's accompanied by savage insects !
What ? How ? He wasn't supposed to actually find someone !
Oh, look at this.
This is great. Look.
- Oh, my ticker !
- So, what are you supposed to be ?
He's a stick, stupid.
You hit bugs with him.
- Well, that's an oversimplification.
- That's right, kids. Like this !
- No ! Put me down !
- Ow !
- Hey !
- My, you just pop right open there, dontcha ?
- Ooh ! Wow !
- Uh-oh. Kids, He's kinda ticklish.
- [ Laughing ]
- Let's come on out. Careful.
[ Laughs ]
Well, my boy, you came through.
- Aphie and I are very impressed.
- [ Aphie Barks ]
Princess Atta! Hey, guys, Princess Atta!
She's the one that sent me to find you!
- Did you see that really big bug over there ?
- He looks absolutely ferocious !
- They're our ticket out of this mess !
- They came just in time !
So, Princess Atta, what do you think ?
No-no-no, wait !
This was not supposed to happen.
Mayday, Mayday.
We're losin' the job.
We don't fight grasshoppers.
- We don't, but they will.
- Bingo !
We gotta sweeten the deal.
Your Majesty, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls of all ages, our troupe here guarantees a performance like no other !
Why, when your grasshopper friends get here, we are gonna... knock them dead !
[ Cheering ]
Boy, these folks are sure hard up for entertainment.
Come on, come on. Hurry.!
[ Panting ]
Wow !
** [ Lively Dance Beat ]
Honey, relax.
You should be proud of yourself.
- Your instincts on that boy were right on the money.
- [ Chuckles ]
** [ Music Ends ]
And to make our official welcome complete-- Mr. Soil ?
- Yes, Your Highness ?
- He's our resident thespian.
Last year he played the lead in Picnic. [ Laughs ]
The children-- and myself-- have quickly put together... a little presentation in honor of our guests.
Dot, Reed, Daisy, Grub ?
Oh, aren't they adorable !
Ooh, they're cute !
The South Tunnel Elementary School second grade class... would like to present you with this, a mural we have drawn... of you bugs helping us fight the grasshoppers away.
Oh, look at the beautiful colors of the blood.
We drew one of you dying because our teacher said it would be more dramatic.
- [ Gasps ]
-[ Ants Applauding ]
- [ Playing Harp ]
- I tell you a tale of heroes so bold, who vanquished our grasshopper enemies of old.
Look, the last leaf has fallen.
[ Together] We are the grasshoppers !
Where's our food ?
Who will come to save us poor ants ?
We are the warriors, here to defend you !
I die.! Die.! Die.!
[ Cheering ]
- [ Chattering ]
- Thank you, thank you ! Oh, thank you !
- Hey, hey, hey !
- I say we go.
- Okay, honey. You're up.
- Oh. Um--
- Oh, oh, l-l--
- We're all very grateful to have...
- Here, here.
- [ Amplified ] the warriors--
Thanks.
[ Clears Throat ]
- I'd like to thank the warriors for helping us in our fight...
- [ Arguing ] against the grasshoppers.
Secondly, I would like to thank Flik...
- for his forthright thinking--
- Thank you, Your Highness.
Oh, sure, I'd like to take credit for all of this, but that wouldn't be right.
Because it was you, Princess Atta.
You believed in me--
- Tell that ant that we need
to talk to him right now.
- Okay, okay.
I know I've made mistakes in the past, and I hope that this will make up--
- Flik !
- Not right now, Rosie.
I'm making a speech.
[ Grumbles, Whispers ]
Now, I truly believe these bugs are the answer to our--
No, there's no circus around here.
So, l-- [ Gasps ]
[ Whimpers ]
Your Highness, the warriors have called for a secret meeting to plan for a circus--
circumventing the oncoming hordes so they can trapeze-- trap them with ease !
- Shouldn't I come too ?
- No ! [ Laughs Nervously ]
No, classified in the D.M.Z.
Gotta go A.S.A.P. You know, strictly B.Y.O.B. Bye !
Sorry. Sorry I have to take
the warriors away so early, but you know they have a lot to get done, with the battle looming and all.
So, uh, please,
everyone enjoy the party.
" B.Y.O.B." ?
Thanks again. Bye. Bye-bye.
Okay,just-- just get in there. Go !
Go ! Go, go, go !
Circus bugs ?
How can you be circus bugs ?
- What ?
- Hey, hey, hey.
- You said nothin' about killin' grasshoppers. You lied to us !
-Ja !
Are you kidding ?
Do you know what this is ?
This, my friends, is false advertising.
How dare you ! You, sir, are the charlatan in this scenario-- touting your wares as a talent scout, preying upon the hungry souls of hapless artistes.
Good day to you, sir.
Wait ! No, no !
Wait, wait, wait, wait ! You can't go.
You have got to help me. Give me some time, I'll come up with a plan.
-Just go tell them the truth !
- They can't know the truth.
The truth, you see, is bad.
I will be branded for life.
My children's children will walk down the street, people will point and say, " Look ! There goes the spawn of Flik, the loser !"
Oh-- oh, you know, all right, fine.
Yeah, okay. Just go.
But if you could just do me a little favor before you leave.
If you could squish me, that would be great, because, uh, when they find out,
I'm as good as dead.
-[ Princess Atta ] Flik.!
- [ Gasps ]
I really do think I should be
part of this meeting. Flik.!
Aah ! Princess Atta !
What a nice... surprise.
Just what exactly is going on ?
I would like to speak with the so-called " warriors."
You can't ! They are in the middle of a top secret meeting right now, and they really should not be disturbed... now.
Right, guys ?
[ Gasps ] Could you ex-- pl--
Could you excuse me, please ?
- Wait, wait, wait.! Please, don't go.!
- I'm not going anywhere.
What is going on ? Flik ?
Flik ! [ Groans ]
Ooh, I knew it !
[ Flik In Distance ] Wait.! Wait,
wait, wait, wait.! Please.! Don't go.!
- No !
- Quick, he's losin' it !
- You can't go ! I'm desperate !
- Really ? I couldn't tell.
Hmm. Come on, wings.
[ Screams ]
Help !
Mother,
Flik is up to something.
Okay, Flik, time to put ya down.
Get him off me !
He's cutting off the circulation.
- No, no, no, no !
- Let go !
- Please, please, don't go !
- [ Rosie ] Put the stick down.
Flik, I mean it, now.
- Drop the stick.
- [ Screams ] Run !
Boy, he runs fast for a little guy.
- [ Squawks ]
- Tweet-tweet ! Tweet-tweet !

Please, ma'am, wake up !
Wake up !

- Help ! Help !
- Yoo-hoo.!
Mr. Early Bird ! How about a nice, tasty worm on a stick ?
I'm going to snap.
I'm going to snap.
Nice andjuicy, succulent--
[ Flik ]
Let's go !
- There they are !
- Flik ! Help !
Okay.
- Flik !
- It's going to be okay, Dot.
Ooh-hoo-hoo !
Bye-bye, birdie !
Help ! I'm stuck !
Pull me down.!
Schnell, schnell, schnell !

That, my friends, is the sound of applause !
[ Cheering ]
Applause-- I'm in heaven !
[ Sighs ]
Our Blueberry troop salutes you bugs
for rescuing our smallest member,
Princess Dot.
And as a tribute to Miss Francis, we've changed out bandannas !
We voted you our honorary den mother !
- [ Ants Cheering ]
- What ? Great.
- [ Chattering ]
- All right, girls. Let's move your keisters outta here now.
The patient needs her rest, you know. Come on.
Excuse, me, Flik.
Can I talk to you for a second ?
- Huh ? Oh, sure.
- Oww !
Again, thank you all, very, very much.
- Oh, stop it.
- You're too kind.
- Thank you.
You don't think I've offended the warriors, do you ?
You ? No.
Oh, good. Because, you see, when you first brought them here,
I thought you'd hired a bunch of clowns.
Ya did ?
[ Laughs Nervously ]
Don't tell 'em I said that.
Boy, that's all I'd need,
another royal blunder like that.
- Princess, you're doin' a great job.
- Thanks, you're sweet.
You're wrong, but sweet.
- I know what everyone really thinks.
- I don't follow you.
Everyone-- the whole colony. Nobody really believes I can do this job.
It's like they're all watching me,
-just,just--
- Waiting for you to screw up.
- Flik, I owe you an apology.
- For what ?
Well, I haven't been that nice to you, and... I'm sorry.
If there's any way I can make it up to you--
Hey ! I know !
How would you like to be the queen's official aide to the warrior bugs ?
- Me ?
- Oh, sure. You've got a great rapport with them, especially after that rescue-- it was very brave.
- Really ? Naw, naw--
- Well, not every bug would face a bird.
- I mean, even Hopper's afraid of'em.
- Yeah, well, I guess maybe l--
- Say that again ?
- I said, even Hopper's afraid of birds.
Thank you.
- Hopper's afraid of birds !
- And I don't blame 'im !
Oh, oh, oh, this is perfect.
We can get rid of Hopper, and no one has to know that I messed up.
You just keep pretending you're warriors.
Whoa, Flik, honey. We are not about to fight grasshoppers, okay ?
You'll be gone before the grasshoppers ever arrive. Here's what we do.
Not another word.
I don't know what you're concocting in that little ant brain of yours, but we'll have no part of it.
Excuse me ? Could we get
the warriors'autographs ?
Autographs ? Ja !
- Wow! Great!
- So, you fellas catch the action today?
Oh ! The bird went-- [ Whooshes ] and it just missed you !
- Aren't you sweet ?
- And the way you pretended to be stuck in that crack !
[ Chuckling ]
Oh, that's just all part of the plan.
And then you dive-bombed into the bush !
- There you go, my boy.
- Wow ! Thanks !
" M-M-Maa-jor--"
That's Major Manny, young cadet.
-I outrank everyone here. Remember that.
-Yes, sir !
- Dismissed !
- Wow !
- When I grow up,
I'm gonna be a praying mantis !
- I'm gonna be a stick bug !
Oh, they're all so cool,
I can't pick.!
[ Chuckling ] Delightful lads.
You were saying, Flik ?
All right.
We are going to build a bird-- a bird that we can operate from the inside, which would then be--
...hoisted above the anthill and hidden high in the tree.
Then, right when Hopper and his gang are below, we'll launch the bird and scare off the grasshoppers.
Now it's going to take everyone's involvement--
...to make this plan a reality.
I know it's not our tradition to do things differently, but if our ancestors were able to build this anthill, we can certainly rally together to build this bird !
[ All Cheering ]
[ Laughing ]
- Perfect !
- Okay, hit your marks !
- Whoa !
- Whee-hee !
- [ Giggles ] Hi, Flik.
- Oh.

Ooh, don't even say that !
You know somethin' ?
You're makin' a lot of sense.
I mean, why take the risk ?
- You should tell Hopper.
- Good idea.
But, you know, it's really not our place.
You're his brother.
That makes you, like... the vice president of the gang.
Wow ! It kinda does, doesn't it ?
Okay, I'll tell 'im.
I should talk to you guys more often.
- What if Hopper doesn't like it ?
- Then the genius'll get smacked and not us.

Ooh, yeah, that's good.
Oh, that's good.

- Hey ya, Hop.
- Go away.

Then I won't tell ya my idea.
- Good !
- Okay, okay. I'll tell ya anyway.
I've been thinkin'-- which is somethin'
I do, bein' vice president and all.
This is a thought, and it was mine:
Why go back to Ant Island at all?
- You don't even like grain.
- What?
You're right. I didn't think it was such a good idea myself.
It wasn't even my idea.
It was Axle and Loco's !

What was I thinking ?
Going back to Ant Island.
I mean, we just got here, and we have more than enough food to get us through the winter.
Right ? Why go back ?

But there was that ant that stood up to me.
- Yeah, but we can forget about him !
- Yeah, it was just one ant.
- [ Mock Scared ] Ooo-oooh !
- One ant !
Yeah, you're right !
It's just one ant !
- Yeah, boss. They're puny !
- Hmm, puny.
Say, let's pretend this grain is a puny little ant.
- Didn't that hurt ?
- Nope.
- Well, how 'bout this one ?
- Are you kiddin' ?
- [ Laughing ]
- Well, how 'bout this ?
[ Screaming ]
You let one ant stand up to us, then they all might stand up.
Those puny little ants outnumber us a hundred to one.
And if they ever figure that out, there goes our way of life !
It's not about food.
It's about keeping those ants in line.
That's why we're going back !
Does anybody else wanna stay ?

Ooh-boppa-doo and how do you do ?
I am the great P.T. Flea !
[ Laughs ]
I'm in need of your assis--
Oh, let's just cut to the chase.
Look, I've been goin'
from anthill to anthill.
I'm lookin' for a bunch of circus performers. Have you seen 'em ?
- [ Crowd Groans ]
- [ Gasps ]
Wait a second.
Ain't that Staff Sergeant Slim ?
No, no, no. I'm sorry, no, but uh--
[ Continues, Indistinct ]
- [ Rustling, Groaning ]
- [ Whispering ] Be quiet.!
Hey !
[ Flik ] You'll probably--
you'll probably want to get goin;
I guess you got a lot of other anthills to check into, so, bye !
- [ All Gasp ]
- Ah, guys, I've been lookin' all over for ya !
- Flaming Death is a huge hit !
- P.T. ! Sh--
- I'm serious. Word of mouth got around.
- P. T. .! No.!
The next day, there was a line of flies outside the tent went on forever !
- It must have been a foot long !
-[ Rosie ] P. T., no.!
So, I figured it out. You guys burn me twice a night, I take a day off to heal, and then we do it all over again !
We'll be the top circus act in the business ! [ Guffaws ]
You mean, you're not warriors ?
Are you kiddin' ? These guys are the lousiest circus bugs you've ever seen.
And they're gonna make me rich !
[ Chortling ]
You mean to tell me that our entire defensive strategy... was concocted by clowns ?
Hey, hey, hey, hey. We really thought
Flik's idea was gonna work.
[ Crowd Gasps, Groans ]
- Oops.
- Tell me this isn't true.
- No, you don't-- You don't--
- This couldn't have happened at a more inopportune time !
The last leaf is about to fall !
[ Dr. Flora ] We haven't collected
any food for the grasshoppers.!
If Hopper finds out
what we almost did--
Hopper is not going
to find out.
We're going to hide all this, and pretend it never happened.
You bugs were never here.
So I suggest you all leave.
But the bird !
The-The bird will work.
I never thought I'd see the day when an ant would put himself...
-before the rest ofhis colony.
- What ?
- The point is, Flik, you lied to us.
- No, no, no ! l-l--
You lied, Flik. You lied to her.
You lied to the colony !
You lied to me.!
And like an idiot,
I believed you.
But l-I was just afraid that... if you knew I'd gotten circus bugs--
[ Sighs Deeply ]
- I just wanted to make a difference.
- I want you to leave, Flik.
And this time, don't come back.
[ Crowd Gasps, Murmurs ]
- [ Gasps ]
- [ Whimpers ]
Tough crowd. Yee-haw !
Flik !
[ Thumper ]
Get those bugs.!
[ Panting ]
[ Crowd Chattering ]
[ Grunting ]
That's it ? But there's got to be more food on the island !
If we give up any more, we'll starve.
- Hopper won't accept this !
-[ Roaring ]
[ Roaring Intensifies ]
- [ Whimpering ]
- Mother, it's not enough.
- What do we do ?
- l-I don't know.
-[ Roaring Stops ]
- [ Gasping ]
[ Gasping, Swallowing ]
[ Heavy Footsteps ]
[ Gasps ]
[ Growling, Screeching ]
- [ Crowd Gasping ]
- You little termites !
I give you a second chance, and this is all I get ?
- [ Screaming ]
- But Hopper, we ran out of time !
Have you been playing all summer ?
You think this is a game ?
- No, no, please !
- Well, guess what ?
You just lost.
- [ Screeching ]
- Not one ant sleeps... until we get every scrap of food... on this island !
Just do what he says. You don't want to make him mad. Believe me !
No, no, no.
You're staying with me, Your Highness.
- [ Screaming ]
- What do you think you're doing ?
- Get over there.
- Quick ! To the clubhouse.
- [ Rustling ]
- [ Gasping ] Hurry !
- Shh !
- [ Grasshopper ]
Shut up a minute, will ya ?
- I think I heard something over here.
- Have you checked over there ?
- No, not yet.
- Then get over there and check it out!
- Wait a minute.
- [ Gasps ]
- Hey, I think I found something.
- [ Footsteps Approaching ]
[ Laughs ]
Cool. Hey, how do I look ?
Like an idiot.
Oh, I don't know, maybe it'll keep me dry in the rain.
You moron, we'll be out of here before it rains.
Didn't you hear Hopper ?
After the ants pick all the food,
he's gonna squish the queen
to remind 'em who's boss.
Then she's dead. They cry--boo-hoo--
we go home. End of story.
Oh ! Cool. I love our job.
Stay here.
I'm gonna get help.
[ Grunts ]
[ Panting ]
Ooh !

**I'm rich, rich, rich

*** [ P. T. Continues Singing,
Indistinct ]
- Poor fellow.
- Hey, maybe we can cheer him up a bit.
Don't worry, Flik.
The circus life isn't so bad.
- Yes, you can be part of our act.
- Here ! Like this.
Oof! Ahh.
Slapstick ! Get it ?
l-I'm a walkingstick.
[ Laughs Weakly ] Oh, never mind.
-[ Dot ] Flik.!
- Dot ?
Flik, wait ! Wait !
Dot, you're flying !
What are you doing here ?
[ Panting ]
You... have to go back.
Hopper moved into the anthill, and his gang's eating everything !
- Oh, no !
- Good heavens !
And I heard a grasshopper say that when they're finished,
Hopper's gonna squish my mom !
- Oh, not the queen !
- Do something !
- How ?
- [ Rosie ] Come on,you guys, think.!
- I know. The bird.
- Yes, of course.
- The bird ! That's brilliant.
-Ja !
- The bird won't work.
- What are you talking about ?
It was your idea.
- But you said that everything--
Forget everything I ever told you.
All right, Dot ?
Let's face it. The colony is right.
I just make things worse.
That bird is a guaranteed failure.
[ Sighs ]
Just like me.
You listen to me, my boy. I've made a living out of being a failure.
And you, sir, are not a failure.!
- Oh, but Flik, you've done so many good things.
- Oh, yeah ?
Okay, show me one thing
I've done right.
- Umm--
- Us.
-[ Bugs ] Yeah. Yeah,yeah.
- Dim is right, my boy.
You have rekindled the long-dormant embers of purpose in our lives.
And if it wasn't for you,
Francis would have never gotten in touch with his feminine side.
Oh yeah ? Well-- Hmm.
[ Chuckles ]
You know what ? He's right.
Lieutenant Gypsy reporting for duty.
- Kid, say the word and we'll follow you into battle.
- We believe in you, my boy.
Flik, please ?
Pretend it's a seed, okay ?
[ Chuckles ]
Thanks, Dot.
- Hey, what's with the rock ?
- Must be an ant thing.
All right, let's do it.
- [ Laughing, Cheering ]
- That's the Flik we know and love.
- We're on !
- So, what do we do first ?
* Bugs will pay big bucks to see *
* A bonfire that is starring me **
[ Laughing ]
P.T., look. Money !
[ P. T.]
Where ? Where ? [ Screaming ]
All right. Get movin' ! Get goin'.
Move your abdomens, now !
[ Flik ]
They're rounding everyone up.
- [ Gasps ]
- Hey ! Turn your butt off.
Psst ! Hey, guys !
Get me out of this thing, will ya ?
I promise to start thinkin' about payin' ya.
Hey.! Wait, wait.!
Okay, I'll pay ya.! I'll pay ya.!
[ Flik ] Oh, no.!
They've finished collecting the food.
We've got to get the queen now.
Once she's safe, we move on Gypsy's signal.
-[ Rattling ]
- [ Gasps ] Someone's coming !
[ Rattling Continues ]
Hello, kids ! Ready to make some grasshoppers cry ?
It's payback time,
Blueberry-style.
- [ Grunting ]
- Blueberries rock !
- [ All Cheering ]
- All right !
- [ Growling ]
-[ Drum Rolling ]
[ Slim ] Ladies and Gentlebugs.!
Larvae of all stages.!
Rub your legs together for
the world's greatest bug circus.!
- Wait a minute.
- [ Brakes Screeching ]
- I think I'm going to wet myself.
- Steady--
- What's going on here ?
- Well, uh--
Uh,yes.
[ Chuckling ]
We were invited by Princess Atta...
as a surprise for your arrival.
- Squish 'em.
- [ Gasping ]
Ooh--
[ Gasps ]
[ Together] Hey !
** [ Gibberish ]

[ Yelling Gibberish ]

Now that's funny.
That is funny.
I guess we could use a little entertainment.
Looks like you did something right for once, Princess.
-[ Laughing Uneasily ] On with the show!
-Hi-ya !
Hey!
* The circus, the circus
I love the circus *
[ Cheering, Yelling ]
[ Panting ]
- [ Sucking ]
- Ba-ba all gone !
Baby wants pie !
Pie ? He asked for it.
Should I give it to him ?
Yeah ! Give 'em pie !
Give 'em pie !
- [ All Cheering ]
- Yeah ! Hah !
Thank you, gentlemen.
Always an intellectual treat.
Say, how many roaches does it take to screw in a light bulb ?
Can't tell. As soon as the light goes on, they scatter !
[ Hysterical Laughing Continues ]
[ Laughing ]
[ Panting ]
Ah, almost there.
From the most mysterious regions of uncharted Asia,
- I give you the Chinese Cabinet...
- Come on, girls. Quick. Quick.
of Metamorphosis.!
Utilizing psychic vibrations,
- [ Gasps ] Ooh, ohh, pick me !
- I shall select the perfect volunteer.
Ooh, no ! Come on,
I'm askin' ya with my brain.
- [ Moaning ] Aha! Why, Your Majesty!
- Me?
- [ Snarling ]
- No, no. Thumper, down. Let her go.
Maybe he'll saw her in half.
[ Snickering ]
As you ascend the dung beetle to the unknown, put your trust in the mysteries that are beyond mere mortal comprehension.
Ooh, this is gonna be good !
- Blueberries ready ?
- [ All ] Ready.
- [ Amplified Voice ] Ready !
- Shh !
I call upon the ancient
Szechwan spirits...
to inhabit the body
of our volunteer.!
No, no.
Just stay in there, Your Majesty.
Transformation.
Transformation !
Transformation.!
Wow.
Manny's gettin' good.
- [ Gasps ] Not now.
- If it rains, that bird'll get ripped to shreds !
Shh !
And now, insectus...
transformitus.!
[ All ]
Ooh !
- Ooh !
- Ooh, pretty !
-[ Applauding ]
- Thank you, thank you.
- Thank you.
- That's the signal. That's the signal.!
[ Grunts ]
This is it, girls.
Get ready to roll.
- Huh ? It's stuck !
- That was amazing !
I have no-- How did they do that ?
I have no idea where she went.
- Thank you. Thank you, thank you.
-[ Audience ] More, more, more.!
Wait !
- Where is she ?
- Well, now, uh, actually--
I am sorry. A magician never reveals his secrets.
That's very true, Hoppy. Where would the mystery be if we all knew how it was--
- Shutting up.
- [ Grunting ]
- You can do it !
You've got to make it work !
- Hey !
I said, where is she ?
- [ Whimpering ]
- Ohh !
[ Grunting ]
[ Screaming ]
Hold on !
[ Amplified Cawing ]
[ Screaming ]
Bird ! It's a bird !
[ All Yelling ]
[ Cawing ]
- [ Laughing ]
- Let's get out of here ! Go !
Don't let it get me !
Don't let it get me !
Help me ! Aaah !
[ Cackling ]
[ Dot ]
Up, down, up, down.
- And turn !
- [ Grunting ]
[ Screaming ]
- Oh, my eye ! Help me !
- [ Screaming ]
[ Screaming ]
[ Screaming ]
Mmm, boysenberry.
Huh ?
Aah, no, no, no, no, no !
[ Grunting ]
- [ Screaming ]
- [ Moaning ] Oh, the pain !
There goes my magic act !
- Flaming gas !
- No ! P.T. !
[ Screaming ]
A direct hit ! Ah-hee-ha !

- Run !
- [ Gasps ]
- Flik ! Help us !
[ Snarls ]
[ Gasps ]
Dot !
[ Flik ]
Okay ! Everyone out ! Hurry !
[ Coughing ]
Where's Dot ?
Anyone seen Dot ?
- [ Screaming ]
- Whose idea was this ?
Huh ?
Was it yours, Princess ?
Just get behind me, girls.
It'll be okay.
[ Flik ]
Leave her alone, Hopper.
The bird was my idea.
I'm the one you want.
[ Snapping ]
[ Shrieking ]
[ Blows Landing,
Flik Grunting ]
- Ohh.
- [ Grunting ]
- [ Shrieking ]
- [ Snapping ]
[ Growling ]
Where do you get the gall to do this to me ?
[ Panting ] You were--
You were gonna squish the queen.
- [ All Gasping ]
- It's true.
I hate it when someone gives away the ending.
- [ Roaring ]
- [ Moaning ]
You piece of dirt !
No, I'm wrong.
You're lower than dirt.
You're an ant !
Let this be a lesson
to all you ants.
Ideas are very dangerous things.
You are mindless,
soil-shoving losers, put on this earth to serve us !
[ Flik ]
You're wrong, Hopper.
[ Groaning ]
[ Inhaling Deeply ] Ants are not meant to serve grasshoppers !
I've seen these ants do great things.
And year after year, they somehow manage...
to pick food
for themselves and you.
So-So who is the weaker species ?
Ants don't serve grasshoppers.
It's you who need us.
[ Crowd Gasping, Chattering ]
We're a lot stronger than you say we are.
And you know it, don't you ?
[ Grunts ]
[ Chuckles ]
Well, Princess !
Umm, Hopper ?
I hate to interrupt, but, um--
You ants stay back !
- Oh, this was such a bad idea !
- You see, Hopper, nature has a certain order.
The ants pick the food, the ants keep the food, and the grasshoppers leave !
[ Yelling ]
- I'm so proud of you, Flik !
- Charge-a !
Where are you going ?
They're just ants !
Oof!
- [ Screams ]
- [ Snarls ]
No ! Bad grasshopper !
Bad grasshopper ! Go home !
- [ Roaring ]
- [ Roaring Louder]
[ Whining, Yelping ]
- [ Chuckles ]
- Yeah !
[ Hopper ] Come back here,
you cowards.! Don't leave.!
- [ Flik ] To the cannon !
- [ Ants ] To the cannon !
[ Hopper]
No !
[ Hopper Screaming ]
[ Chuckles ]
Happy landings, Hopper !
- [ Thunder Crashing ]
- Huh ?
Rain !
[ Growling ]
[ Roaring ]
- Flik !
- Quick ! After them !
- Yaah !
- Aah ! Aah !
Aah ! Slim !
- Francis.! Francis.! Francis, I'm stuck.!
- Where are ya?
- I'm over here.! Here.!
- Where ?
I'm the only stick with eyeballs.!
- Help ! Help !
- Get him !
- Yes ! Yes !
- [ Thunder Crashing ]
No !
- [ Giggling ]
- [ Chattering ]
- [ Chattering ]
- [ Giggling ]
[ Screaming ]
- Go that way ! I've got an idea !
- But the anthill's over--
- [ Hopper Roaring ]
- [ Atta Screaming ]
- Flik !
- Come on !
[ Screaming ]
[ Flik ]
There !
[ Atta Grunts ]
Come on !
We've gotta hide !
No matter what happens, stay down !
Flik, no !
What are you doing ?
- Uh-- Hopper !
- You think it's over ?
No, no, no.
No, l-I can explain.
- All your little stunt did was buy them time !
- No, please !
Please, Hopper !
I'll get more grasshoppers and be back next season, but you won't !
[ Chirping ]
- [ Choking ]
- Well, what's this ?
Another one of your little bird tricks ?
- Yup.
- Are there a bunch of little girls in this one too ?
- Hello, girls !
- [ Screeching ]
[ Screaming In Terror]
No.! No.!
No, no, no, no.!
No ! Aah !
[ Screaming ] No !
Oh, no !
Oh, no.! No, no, no.!
[ Screams ]
[ Horn Blowing ]
Come on, boys !
- Hey, Princess Dot ! Wait up !
- [ Giggling ]
[ Sighs ]
I finally get a second to relax, and I gotta get out of my chair.
- Come on ! You can rub lotion on me later, shade boy.
- Yeah, hubba-hubba.
[ Both Laughing ]
- [ Laughing, Chattering ]
- [ Heimlich ] Oh, thank you !
- Oh, you're too kind !
- It was the least we could do.
All in a day's work.
Dim !
- Ohh !
- [ Kids ] Ohh !
I'm so sorry, kids.
I wish you could come along too.
- [ Kids Weeping ]
- I'm not gonna cry. I'm not gonna cry.
[ Chattering ]
[ Chattering ]
[ Laughing ]
Hey, let's go. We got a schedule to keep. Come on, let's go.
- Hup, hup, hey !
- Hey, Tiny !
Let's get this show packed up !
We got paying customers hatching !
Yes, Mr. Flea. Yes, sir.
Of course, sir. Right away, sir.
And, um, I just wanted to thank you for giving me a chance, because it's an honor to work with creative giants such as yourself.
- Shutting up.
- You sure you can't come on tour with us ?
- Sorry. My place is here.
- Good answer.
Oh, well. Your loss.
One minute, insects !
I wanna thank all of you... for giving us back our hope, our dignity, and our lives.
And to you, Princess Atta.
You have given us so much.
Please accept this gift from us bugs... to you ants.
- For you !
- Oh ! It's a rock.
- [ Chuckling ]
- What's with the rock ?
Must be a circus thing.
[ Giggling ]
Well, Flik, you really goofed up.
- Thanks.
- Yeah, you too.
[ Gasps ]
[ Crowd Cheering ]
- [ Giggling ]
- [ Sniffling ] All right.
Now it's gettin' mushy.
- We're outta here ! Hy-aah !
- [ Whip Cracking ]
- Whoa !
- [ Rosie ] See ya next season !
- [ Francis ] See ya, Flik !
- Bye ! We miss you already !
- You fired !
- [ Gasps ] We forgot Heimlich !
I'm finished ! Finally,
I'm a beautiful butterfly !
[ Grunting ]
Mein wings !
Oh, they're beautiful !
[ Flik ] Heimlich ! The wagon's taking off! You better start flying !
But I am flying ! And from way up here, you all look like little ants !
Auf Wiedersehen !
Bye !
Present stalks !
Harvester, salute !

<b>l don't know. As a kid, l was a pitcher.</b>
<b>l think outfield,</b>
<b>because it'll be hard for me to pitch.</b>
<b>Let's get out of here. This stinks.</b>
<b>Don't bring me again.</b>
<b>Don't bring me again.</b>
<b>Are you listening?</b>
<b>Did you hear him? Did you hear him?</b>
<b>That little brat is right.</b>
<b>l told you, if l've told you once...</b>
<b>...l told you a thousand, thousand,</b>
<b>thousand, thousand times!</b>
<b>We need new attractions!</b>
<b>New ones!</b>
<b>Get it?</b>
<b>Big, shiny new things.</b>
<b>Absolutely, sir.</b>
<b>Look at me and listen:</b>
<b>The customer is always right!</b>
<b>Right!</b>
<b>The customer is always right!</b>
<b>Exactly!</b>
<b>Always!</b>
<b>Right!</b>
<b>Okay, we need something.</b>
<b>We need something...</b>
<b>...nutty!</b>
<b>Something wacky.</b>
<b>Wacky!</b>
<b>We need something, something....</b>
<b>Looney? Oops!</b>
<b>Looney. Thank you!</b>
<b>Looney?</b>
<b>Yes! Looney!</b>
<b>Now you're talking!</b>
<b>Looney! Looney! That's it!</b>
<b>That's the word l was looking for!</b>
<b>Get the Looney Tunes.</b>
<b>Bring them here.</b>
<b>Sir, just noticing...</b>
<b>...they're from Earth.</b>
<b>What if they can't come?</b>
<b>What did you say?</b>
<b>What if they can't come?</b>
<b>Make them.</b>
<b>Cool.</b>
<b>Make them!</b>
<b>We're gonna get them!</b>
<b>Strike!</b>
<b>Looks good in that uniform.</b>
<b>Looks great. Can't teach that.</b>
<b>Can't teach it.</b>
<b>Thanks for autographing</b>
<b>that basketball for my kid.</b>
<b>l'm happy to do it.</b>
<b>Let's go!</b>
<b>Curve ball. Don't swing.</b>
<b>Don't...swing.</b>
<b>Ball!</b>
<b>Fastball, outside corner. Swing.</b>
<b>Strike!</b>
<b>That was your pitch.</b>
<b>l know, l missed it.</b>
<b>l'll get you another one.</b>
<b>Podolak!</b>
<b>Come here.</b>
<b>-l'm sorry, l didn't mean to--</b>
<b>-Come here!</b>
<b>Make sure that nobody bothers Michael.</b>
<b>l want him to be the happiest player.</b>
<b>Slider. Don't swing.</b>
<b>Strike three!</b>
<b>l told you not to!</b>
<b>l couldn't help it.</b>
<b>l know. Nice talking to you!</b>
<b>We're not worried.</b>
<b>Good cut.</b>
<b>That was a good-looking strikeout.</b>
<b>You look good when you strike out.</b>
<b>When l do, it looks nasty.</b>
<b>At least you look good. Good-looking.</b>
<b>Hi, Mr. Jordan.</b>
<b>l'm Stan Podolak.</b>
<b>Oh, jeez.</b>
<b>You okay?</b>
<b>That was a nasty fall.</b>
<b>l'm Stan Podolak, Mr. Jordan,</b>
<b>the Baron's new publicist.</b>
<b>l'm here to make your life easier.</b>
<b>Can l drive you somewhere?</b>
<b>You want me to pick up your laundry,</b>

<b>l am here to personally guarantee...</b>
<b>...that no one will ever bother you.</b>
<b>What was that?</b>
<b>Hang on!</b>
<b>-Hanging on!</b>

<b>-Bombastic!</b>
<b>-Cool.</b>
<b>You irascible bunny!</b>
<b>Come back here, you screwy rodent!</b>
<b>l'll be with you in a second, folks,</b>

<b>All right, you pesky rabbit.</b>
<b>l've got you now!</b>
<b>One small step for moi....</b>
<b>One giant leap for Moron Mountain!</b>
<b>And one whopper headache for Elmer Fudd.</b>
<b>Diminutive, ain't they?</b>
<b>We seek the one they call Bugs Bunny.</b>
<b>-Have you seen him?</b>
<b>-Where is he?</b>
<b>ls he around?</b>
<b>Bugs Bunny, Bugs Bunny.</b>
<b>Say, does he have great big long ears?</b>
<b>Like this?</b>
<b>Does he hop around...</b>
<b>...like this?</b>
<b>Does he say, ''What's up, doc?'' like this:</b>
<b>What's up, doc?</b>
<b>Nope! Never heard of him.</b>
<b>You know,</b>
<b>maybe there is no intelligent life...</b>
<b>...out in the universe after all.</b>
<b>Hold on there, Mr. Looney Tune.</b>
<b>What do you think we are? Stupid?</b>
<b>Don't move a muscle.</b>
<b>Okay, bunny, gather up your Tune pals.</b>
<b>-We're taking you for a ride.</b>
<b>-Move it.</b>
<b>Totally. All right.</b>
<b>So, like, where are we going?</b>
<b>Are we there yet?</b>
<b>-Sorry it took so long.</b>
<b>-Don't worry about it.</b>
<b>That exit on 65 wasn't clearly marked.</b>
<b>-Hold up, right here.</b>
<b>-Here?</b>
<b>Thanks, Sherm.</b>
<b>-Appreciate it.</b>
<b>-lt's Stan, Mike.</b>
<b>You can call me Sherm if you want.</b>
<b>l follow your career and l think you're</b>
<b>the greatest athlete that's ever lived.</b>
<b>How do l get out?</b>
<b>The door doesn't work.</b>
<b>lt's a classic.</b>
<b>lt's a classic, but it's got</b>
<b>a few peccadillos. Hold on.</b>
<b>A few?</b>
<b>lt's smoking too.</b>
<b>Thanks for the ride.</b>
<b>This is nice. This is a nice house.</b>
<b>Beautiful. What is that, Colonial?</b>
<b>lt's a nice house.</b>
<b>lf you need help with the house....</b>
<b>l'm fine, thanks.</b>
<b>You gave me a ride. Thanks.</b>
<b>l'll drive tomorrow, so l don't need a ride.</b>
<b>But thanks, though.</b>
<b>Too conspicuous?</b>
<b>Yeah.</b>
<b>Thanks, though.</b>
<b>-Tomorrow!</b>
<b>-See you tomorrow.</b>
<b>Come on! No, not today!</b>
<b>Get off me! Your breath!</b>
<b>Mr. Jordan, are you okay?</b>
<b>Get off of him, Charles!</b>
<b>Bad dog! Git!</b>
<b>Pooch, stop it!</b>
<b>Get off of him before l cook you!</b>
<b>Come on, come on, baby.</b>
<b>Get out!</b>
<b>Good game.</b>
<b>Hey, Jeff, you okay?</b>
<b>-How was your game?</b>
<b>-l don't want to talk about it.</b>
<b>How are you?</b>
<b>You're covered with drool!</b>
<b>That's your dog.</b>
<b>What's wrong with Jeff?</b>
<b>He lost 32 points in his average.</b>
<b>ls that all?</b>
<b>So that puts him at .685 or something.</b>
<b>He's batting what?</b>
<b>Smells good in here. What you cooking?</b>
<b>Chicken.</b>
<b>Chicken and what?</b>
<b>Collard greens.</b>
<b>Good. l need a good meal tonight.</b>
<b>ls everything okay?</b>
<b>l stunk up the place.</b>
<b>Hope baseball was a good idea.</b>
<b>It was another career</b>
<b>day for Michael Jordan.</b>
<b>What're you watching?</b>
<b>He had 3 strikeouts.</b>
<b>ls this the only thing on TV?</b>
<b>What's up with this?</b>
<b>His batting average is .21 4,</b>
<b>which is his weight.</b>
<b>Get this guy a tennis racquet!</b>
<b>Did everyone get mad at you?</b>
<b>No. Worse.</b>
<b>They were nice about it.</b>
<b>I know golf is your sport.</b>
<b>But not here.</b>
<b>You should open your stance.</b>
<b>lt might make you more aggressive.</b>
<b>You think so? l'll remember that.</b>
<b>Watching this hurt me more than you.</b>
<b>Why are you watching this stuff?</b>
<b>lt's bad for you.</b>
<b>There.</b>
<b>Road Runner.</b>
<b>Stop this cartoon!</b>
<b>We've got an emergency Cartoon</b>
<b>Character Union Meeting to go to.</b>
<b>Hey, wait for me! Hold your horses!</b>
<b>Where'd they go?</b>
<b>Stop the music!</b>
<b>Top duck coming through!</b>
<b>Jeez! lt's getting so a guy can't</b>
<b>even get himself wet around here!</b>
<b>What's the big emergency?</b>
<b>These little guys would like to</b>
<b>make an announcement. Here.</b>
<b>You...</b>
<b>...all of you...</b>
<b>...are now our prisoners!</b>
<b>Oh, we're in big trouble now.</b>
<b>We are taking you to our</b>
<b>theme park in outer space.</b>
<b>No fooling.</b>
<b>You'll be our slaves.</b>
<b>And placed on display for the</b>
<b>amusement of our customers.</b>
<b>Oh, fear clutches my breast.</b>
<b>We ain't a-going...</b>
<b>...nowheres!</b>
<b>Not so fast, doc.</b>
<b>You just can't turn us into slaves.</b>
<b>That would be bad.</b>
<b>You must let us defend ourselves.</b>
<b>Oh, yeah? Who says?</b>
<b>Just a sec.</b>
<b>Read.</b>
<b>What's this?</b>
<b>''Give them a chance</b>
<b>to defend themselves.''</b>
<b>Do we have to?</b>
<b>lt's a rule.</b>
<b>Okay. lt is in the rule book.</b>
<b>Una momento!</b>
<b>We must confer.</b>
<b>All right, troops. lt is for us to</b>
<b>choose a battlefield that affords us--</b>
<b>l got it.</b>
<b>Yes, Private Porkster?</b>
<b>How about we challenge them to a...</b>
<b>...spelling bee?</b>
<b>Say...</b>
<b>...we could have a bowling tournament.</b>
<b>Suffering succotash!</b>
<b>What's wrong with you?</b>
<b>Let's get a ladder...</b>
<b>...wait till the old lady's gone...</b>
<b>...and grab that little bird!</b>
<b>Whoa! Take a deep breath, Sly!</b>
<b>Okay, let's analyze the competition.</b>
<b>Now what are we looking at here?</b>
<b>We got a small race of invading aliens....</b>
<b>Small arms! Short legs!</b>
<b>Not very fast.</b>
<b>Tiny little guys.</b>
<b>Can't jump high.</b>
<b>We challenge you to a basketball game.</b>
<b>Basketball it is!</b>
<b>Basketball!</b>
<b>What is basketball?</b>
<b>-What's that?</b>
<b>-Beats me.</b>
<b>We didn't have that in school.</b>
<b>Lights!</b>
<b>Pardon me! Sorry.</b>
<b>Down in front!</b>
<b>An exhilarating team sport currently</b>
<b>growing rapidly in popularity...</b>
<b>...is basketball.</b>
<b>Unlike football and baseball,</b>
<b>only 5 men can play on a team.</b>
<b>It's a fast-paced, razzle-dazzle</b>
<b>game that requires quick wits...</b>
<b>...and even faster reflexes.</b>
<b>Here's how it's done professionally.</b>
<b>The National Basketball Association...</b>
<b>...featuring the best players in the world.</b>
<b>The best players in the world!</b>
<b>The best!</b>
<b>Excuse me. Oh, so sorry.</b>
<b>Excuse me.</b>
<b>Get off my nose!</b>
<b>Quiet, they're looking!</b>
<b>lt's basketball!</b>
<b>Where?</b>
<b>Whoa! Now what?</b>
<b>-She's looking.</b>
<b>-Close it up.</b>
<b>Tightly.</b>
<b>You poked me again.</b>
<b>Sweetheart?</b>
<b>l thought you'd get better seats.</b>
<b>-This is the best l could get.</b>
<b>-This guy's doing something weird.</b>
<b>Just let me watch the game.</b>
<b>Barkley is killing us.</b>
<b>Someone's killing someone!</b>
<b>No. Seriously?</b>
<b>A killer!</b>
<b>Let me see!</b>
<b>There! That's the killer!</b>
<b>He's big.</b>
<b>He's good.</b>
<b>He's mine!</b>
<b>Go get him!</b>
<b>Come on! Get back on defense!</b>
<b>Let's go! Get back on d!</b>
<b>What are you doing?</b>
<b>Time out! Call time out!</b>
<b>What's wrong with you?</b>
<b>Let him in.</b>
<b>Open up!</b>
<b>Open!</b>
<b>He did it.</b>
<b>l got it! l got his talent!</b>
<b>Super.</b>
<b>-Sit down, Chuck.</b>
<b>-Man, l'm fine! l am fine!</b>
<b>l played you too much.</b>
<b>-l'm not tired!</b>
<b>-Get the doctor.</b>
<b>You all right?</b>
<b>You sure?</b>
<b>Come on, we're okay.</b>
<b>Come on, let's go.</b>
<b>Come on, Patrick. Showtime!</b>
<b>What's wrong with him?</b>
<b>In a shocking development, 5 NBA</b>
<b>players were put on the disabled list...</b>
<b>...in the last 24 hours, all suffering</b>
<b>from the same mysterious ailment...</b>
<b>...that affects the player's coordination.</b>
<b>l'll be home in a few days.</b>
<b>Put your mom on.</b>
<b>How you doing?</b>
<b>Watching TV?</b>
<b>What's going on?</b>
<b>-You gonna be all right?</b>
<b>-I'm ready, Coach.</b>
<b>Looks like l retired just in time.</b>
<b>l must go.</b>
<b>l'll call you later. Love you, bye.</b>
<b>lt's open!</b>
<b>lt's game time!</b>
<b>Lace up your Nikes.</b>
<b>Grab your Gatorade and we'll</b>
<b>get a Big Mac on the way.</b>
<b>Now we go to the Los Angeles Forum...</b>
<b>...where the Lakers are</b>
<b>refusing to take the court.</b>
<b>Get dressed.</b>
<b>We got a game in 5 minutes!</b>
<b>We're talking a huge fine.</b>
<b>We can't go in the locker room.</b>
<b>You heard what happened to</b>
<b>Barkley and Ewing. There's germs.</b>
<b>Cedric, that was in New York,</b>
<b>3,000 miles away.</b>
<b>Bacteria travels faster</b>
<b>than the speed of light.</b>
<b>Like ''lnvasion of the Body Snatchers.''</b>
<b>All right.</b>
<b>Dress in the hallway.</b>
<b>Okay, okay, which one of you</b>
<b>maroons has ever played basketball?</b>
<b>l have, Coach.</b>
<b>And there's an important question</b>
<b>l must ask you.</b>
<b>What do you think?</b>
<b>l'm partial to purple and gold.</b>
<b>lt's better with my coloring.</b>
<b>Nice outfit, Daffy.</b>
<b>The little aliens say it's</b>
<b>their turn to use the court.</b>
<b>Sure, let the little pipsqueaks</b>
<b>knock themselves out.</b>
<b>Too bad you can't practice</b>
<b>getting taller, boys.</b>
<b>Hey, little pig!</b>
<b>l wet myself.</b>
<b>Time to play a little basketball.</b>
<b>These little pipsqueaks just</b>
<b>turned into superstars!</b>
<b>They're monsters!</b>
<b>Suffering succotash!</b>
<b>They're ''monstars''!</b>
<b>Bye-bye.</b>
<b>l think we might need some help.</b>
<b>1 7 5 yards.</b>
<b>Okay, little fella. You my friend?</b>
<b>Or my enemy?</b>
<b>You are my friend. You are my ally.</b>
<b>You are my associate,</b>
<b>my personal assistant.</b>
<b>You are my weapon. You are leaving.</b>
<b>-Great shot.</b>
<b>-Nice shot.</b>
<b>You can stop posing now.</b>
<b>Good try.</b>
<b>Not bad.</b>
<b>-Something for you to shoot at.</b>
<b>-Hit it good.</b>
<b>Do my best.</b>
<b>Good shot.</b>
<b>l know.</b>
<b>l must ask you something.</b>
<b>The NBA must face reality.</b>
<b>What's happening is serious.</b>
<b>They're going to need</b>
<b>new players with talent.</b>
<b>Skilled guys who never really</b>
<b>thought about a professional career.</b>
<b>Think l got a shot?</b>
<b>Come on, really?</b>
<b>Don't kid.</b>
<b>lt's a man's game.</b>
<b>-You can't play.</b>
<b>-What if l tried hard?</b>
<b>Keep it down.</b>
<b>lt's because l'm white.</b>
<b>No. Larry's white. So what?</b>
<b>Larry's not white. Larry's clear.</b>
<b>Get inside his ball!</b>
<b>You clowns can't beat that.</b>
<b>-My best shot ever.</b>
<b>-You haven't played long.</b>
<b>A Hall-of-Fame shot.</b>
<b>-Nice shot, Mr. Bird.</b>
<b>-Larry, please.</b>
<b>Nice shot, Mr. Larry.</b>
<b>Nice shot.</b>
<b>You can do this.</b>
<b>Don't be nervous, you can do this.</b>
<b>You feel the NBA has to face reality,</b>
<b>don't you?</b>
<b>Look for some players where</b>
<b>they never looked before.</b>
<b>Just look at the ball.</b>
<b>Visualize where you want it to go.</b>
<b>Be the ball.</b>
<b>Get off the tee.</b>
<b>Can't jump.</b>
<b>Go on.</b>
<b>Close to the pin?</b>
<b>For dinner?</b>
<b>-Sounds good.</b>
<b>-l'll go close to the pin.</b>
<b>l'll have some.</b>
<b>Not bad.</b>
<b>Good shot.</b>
<b>Get down.</b>
<b>Look at that spin.</b>
<b>Come on!</b>
<b>lt is alive!</b>
<b>My first hole in one.</b>
<b>Never seen one of these.</b>
<b>Nothing but the bottom of the cup.</b>
<b>-That's his ball too.</b>
<b>-Yeah, it's my ball.</b>
<b>Wait, let me get a picture!</b>
<b>You must smile.</b>
<b>Reach in for the ball and then smile, okay?</b>
<b>ls this good?</b>
<b>Just take the picture!</b>
<b>What kind of camera is that?</b>
<b>Don't point it at me.</b>
<b>-l didn't do anything!</b>
<b>-Where'd he go?</b>
<b>Look out for that first step,</b>
<b>doc, it's a real lulu.</b>
<b>Bugs Bunny?</b>
<b>You expected the Easter Bunny?</b>
<b>You're not real.</b>
<b>Not real? lf l weren't real, could l do this?</b>
<b>ls that Michael?</b>
<b>lt's Michael!</b>
<b>lt's Air Jordan.</b>
<b>Basketball!</b>
<b>l thought l saw....</b>
<b>l did. l did see Michael Jordan.</b>
<b>Pardon me, Mr. Jordan.</b>
<b>Can l have your auto--</b>
<b>Your John Hancock, please?</b>
<b>Let the doctor take a look.</b>
<b>A little high.</b>
<b>Going down!</b>
<b>So, what do you say we go for a little spin?</b>
<b>Let's see what we got inside here.</b>
<b>Say, ''Ahh.''</b>
<b>All right. He's okay!</b>
<b>What's going on here?</b>
<b>l thought you'd never ask.</b>
<b>These aliens from outer space want to</b>
<b>make us slaves in their theme park.</b>
<b>They're little. So we challenged</b>
<b>them to a basketball game.</b>
<b>Then, they ain't so little!</b>
<b>They're huge! We need to beat these guys.</b>
<b>They're talking about slavery!</b>
<b>They'll make us do stand-up,</b>
<b>the same jokes every night!</b>
<b>We'll be locked up like wild animals,</b>
<b>trotted out to perform...</b>
<b>...for a bunch of bug-eyed, fat-headed,</b>
<b>humor-challenged aliens!</b>
<b>What l'm trying to say is...</b>
<b>...we need your help!</b>
<b>l'm a baseball player now.</b>
<b>Right. And l'm a Shakespearean actor.</b>
<b>Mike?</b>
<b>Michael? lt's Stan.</b>
<b>Stan Podolak.</b>
<b>l need you to come out now, okay?</b>
<b>You got a baseball game tomorrow.</b>
<b>And I'd look pretty stupid</b>
<b>if you don't show up.</b>
<b>Think he's all right? l hate to leave him.</b>
<b>He's fine. l think he just had to</b>
<b>get away from that Stan character.</b>
<b>He's pathetic, isn't he?</b>
<b>l'll give us both twos. We weren't in</b>
<b>any kind of emotional state to putt.</b>
<b>l think that's fair.</b>
<b>lf Mike is gone, the NBA is</b>
<b>going to need some new people.</b>
<b>There's room at the top.</b>
<b>An exciting guy</b>
<b>who could even perform at half-time.</b>
<b>You know David Stern?</b>
<b>A phone call from you....</b>
<b>l want to help...</b>
<b>...but l haven't played in a long time.</b>
<b>My timing's off.</b>
<b>We'll fix it.</b>
<b>Look at our facility.</b>
<b>We got hoops.</b>
<b>We got weights.</b>
<b>We've got balls.</b>
<b>You sure do. This place is a mess.</b>
<b>You're worried about a mess?</b>
<b>There's nothing here a little</b>
<b>spit shine wouldn't fix.</b>
<b>Spit shine!</b>
<b>Lemony-fresh.</b>
<b>You guys are nuts.</b>
<b>Correction: We're Looney Tunes.</b>
<b>And as such are the exclusive property</b>
<b>and trademark of Warner Bros. lnc.</b>
<b>l'm here!</b>
<b>Me too!</b>
<b>That hurt.</b>
<b>Who are they?</b>
<b>Remember the tiny aliens l told you about?</b>
<b>You've heard of the Dream Team?</b>
<b>We're the Mean Team, wussieman!</b>
<b>Wussieman.</b>
<b>We're the Monstars.</b>
<b>M-o-n-....</b>
<b>Let's see what you got...</b>
<b>...chump!</b>
<b>l don't play basketball anymore.</b>
<b>''l don't play basketball anymore.''</b>
<b>Maybe you're chicken.</b>
<b>l say, l resemble that remark.</b>
<b>You calling me chicken?</b>
<b>Come here.</b>
<b>Here you go. Take him!</b>
<b>Watch the footwork.</b>
<b>Can you believe it?</b>
<b>Get out of the way!</b>
<b>Everybody.</b>
<b>Look at your hero now.</b>
<b>You guys are making a mistake.</b>
<b>You're all washed up, baldy!</b>
<b>Baldy?</b>
<b>He is not washed up!</b>
<b>-Michael's the greatest!</b>
<b>-Shut up!</b>
<b>My poor little cranium.</b>
<b>You okay?</b>
<b>Yeah, are you okay?</b>
<b>Whoops!</b>
<b>You're not scared of them...</b>
<b>...are you?</b>
<b>Let's play some basketball.</b>
<b>You're...!</b>
<b>You're Charles Barkley.</b>
<b>Girls! Come on over! Hurry up! Hurry!</b>
<b>Look! lt's Charles Barkley!</b>
<b>Can l play?</b>
<b>You're not Charles Barkley.</b>
<b>Just a wanna-be who looks like him.</b>
<b>Sorry.</b>
<b>Break out.</b>
<b>You shouldn't even be here! Be gone!</b>
<b>Wanna-be! Be gone!</b>
<b>Just a few more tests.</b>
<b>Electrolyte levels,</b>
<b>glucose, CBCs, RBCs, etc.</b>
<b>And we've scheduled a stress test...</b>
<b>...and neurological battery</b>
<b>to include EEG and....</b>
<b>And this girl...</b>
<b>...five feet nothing, blocked my shot.</b>
<b>When did you first have this dream?</b>
<b>lt wasn't a dream! lt really happened!</b>
<b>lt climbed up my back...</b>
<b>...and into my brain.</b>
<b>Are there other areas...</b>
<b>...besides basketball...</b>
<b>...where you find yourself...</b>
<b>...unable to perform?</b>
<b>No!</b>
<b>Just asking.</b>
<b>l've been MRl'd, EKG'd,</b>
<b>x-rayed, laser beamed....</b>
<b>l'll never swear again.</b>
<b>l'll never get another technical.</b>
<b>l'll never trash-talk.</b>
<b>l've got other skills.</b>
<b>l could go work on the farm.</b>
<b>Really?</b>
<b>Or maybe l could go back to</b>
<b>the jungle and be a missionary.</b>
<b>What are you saying?</b>
<b>That l'm trying to disobey my mama?</b>
<b>You said that, not me.</b>
<b>l love her.</b>
<b>Still can't find anything wrong!</b>
<b>Maybe nothing's wrong!</b>
<b>Maybe it's just in our head.</b>
<b>We're fine. lt's psychosomatic.</b>
<b>Or has to do with the moon.</b>
<b>l'll never date Madonna again.</b>
<b>What are you doing?</b>
<b>l'm fixing a divot.</b>
<b>He's fixing a divot!</b>
<b>Has anyone here ever played basketball?</b>
<b>l have.</b>
<b>l'd like to try out.</b>
<b>Hi. My name is Lola Bunny.</b>
<b>Lola?</b>
<b>Hello!</b>
<b>My name's Bugs.</b>
<b>You want to play one-on-one, doll?</b>
<b>''Doll''?</b>
<b>On the court, Bugs.</b>
<b>She's hot!</b>
<b>Ready?</b>
<b>l got it! l got it!</b>
<b>That girl's got some skills.</b>
<b>Don't ever call me...</b>
<b>...''doll.''</b>
<b>Check!</b>
<b>Nice playing with you.</b>
<b>Very smooth.</b>
<b>She's obviously nuts about me.</b>
<b>Obviously.</b>
<b>Mais oui.</b>
<b>Where's the ball?</b>
<b>Let's do some drills.</b>
<b>Can anyone lend me some sneakers?</b>
<b>Sneakers?</b>
<b>Sorry.</b>
<b>Someone must get my gear</b>
<b>from my house.</b>
<b>Your house?</b>
<b>ln 3-D land?</b>
<b>Whatever you do...</b>
<b>...remember my North Carolina shorts.</b>
<b>Your shorts? From college?</b>
<b>l wore them under my Chicago Bulls</b>
<b>uniform every game.</b>
<b>l washed them after every game!</b>
<b>l did!</b>
<b>The view back here stinks.</b>
<b>We're in front of his house.</b>
<b>l knew that!</b>
<b>Let's go in this way.</b>
<b>l say, let's go in that way!</b>
<b>He just never learns!</b>
<b>Let me see.</b>
<b>l must be very, very...</b>
<b>...close.</b>
<b>Mother!</b>
<b>Nice digs.</b>
<b>Well, well. l wonder who that could be.</b>
<b>Twinkle, twinkle, little star.</b>
<b>Everyone's sleeping!</b>
<b>l knew that.</b>
<b>Come on, we must find</b>
<b>Michael's basketball stuff.</b>
<b>Nope. Nothing in here.</b>
<b>Nope.</b>
<b>But a very nice dinette set.</b>
<b>Not here.</b>
<b>Let's look upstairs.</b>
<b>Yes, Oh, Fearless Leader.</b>
<b>So, he needs his special underwear.</b>
<b>Sorry.</b>
<b>You think she's got enough toys?</b>
<b>Speaking of toys,</b>
<b>you know all those mugs and...</b>
<b>...lunch boxes with our pictures on them?</b>
<b>You ever see any money from it?</b>
<b>-Not a cent.</b>
<b>-Me neither.</b>
<b>lt's a shame.</b>
<b>We need a new agent.</b>
<b>We're getting screwed.</b>
<b>We've found the trophy room.</b>
<b>Spread out and search the place.</b>
<b>Yes, sahib.</b>
<b>Oh, brother.</b>
<b>Here l am, in the peak of my form...</b>
<b>...playing second banana to</b>
<b>some sort of harebrain....</b>
<b>This could be useful.</b>
<b>lf this were a union job....</b>
<b>That's very nice.</b>
<b>-l could use this.</b>
<b>-One of his shoes.</b>
<b>Where is the other shoe?</b>
<b>Where are you?</b>
<b>Eureka!</b>
<b>Come to Papa.</b>
<b>What a fuzz-foot. You are so clumsy.</b>
<b>Catch.</b>
<b>Thanks.</b>
<b>Time to go.</b>
<b>Did we get everything?</b>
<b>The shorts!</b>
<b>ln there?</b>
<b>Okay, l'll check.</b>
<b>l found the shorts.</b>
<b>The pain!</b>
<b>l'm right behind you.</b>
<b>That's not reassuring.</b>
<b>Nice puppy.</b>
<b>Want a bone?</b>
<b>No dice.</b>
<b>How about a nice ham?</b>
<b>Can't we talk this over?</b>
<b>Down, Beethoven.</b>
<b>The kids are here.</b>
<b>Give it.</b>
<b>Here.</b>
<b>Thanks, kid.</b>
<b>Bad dog!</b>
<b>That is the last time l'm ever</b>

<b>Where you going?</b>
<b>You see, the Looney Tunes have a</b>
<b>big basketball game coming up and...</b>
<b>-...your dad's playing.</b>
<b>-All right!</b>
<b>Yeah! But don't tell anybody!</b>
<b>l see aliens.</b>
<b>Little aliens from outer space.</b>
<b>They forced their way inside your bodies.</b>
<b>They need your talent to win a...</b>
<b>...basketball game against...</b>
<b>...Bugs Bunny.</b>
<b>l also see Michael Jordan...</b>
<b>...being sucked down a golf hole...</b>
<b>...by furry creatures.</b>
<b>That's it. We're going.</b>
<b>We're leaving.</b>
<b>Let's try acupuncture.</b>
<b>Good idea.</b>
<b>This is it! This is it!</b>
<b>l don't know where you are...</b>

<b>You and me both, brother.</b>
<b>Listen, how is this for a new team name:</b>
<b>The Ducks.</b>
<b>Please!</b>
<b>What kind of Mickey Mouse</b>

<b>l'm a cheerleader.</b>
<b>Mr. Commissioner, the place is sealed off.</b>
<b>Quiet!</b>
<b>Listen. After meeting with team owners...</b>
<b>...l decided that until we can guarantee...</b>
<b>...the health of our players...</b>
<b>...there will be no more</b>

<b>Just get out of my way.</b>
<b>Ready?</b>
<b>Let's go!</b>

<b>How did he do that?</b>
<b>Nice shot, Mr. J.</b>
<b>Let's play defense.</b>
<b>Way to go!</b>
<b>Air J!</b>
<b>Red light!</b>
<b>Feed me!</b>
<b>Feed you?</b>
<b>Feed me!</b>
<b>-Bad old putty tat!</b>
<b>-l'll take that.</b>
<b>Don't try this at home!</b>
<b>''l wish l was in the land of--''</b>
<b>Going somewhere?</b>
<b>May l remind you, sir...</b>
<b>...that physical violence is</b>
<b>patently against the rules!</b>
<b>Did you order Original Recipe</b>
<b>or Extra Crispy?</b>
<b>Let's go.</b>
<b>Me?</b>
<b>l'm ready. l can do this.</b>
<b>You picked the mouse?</b>
<b>l love basketball. l always have. Do you?</b>
<b>l bet you're good.</b>
<b>l'm small, but l try hard to be good.</b>
<b>l always try hard.</b>
<b>My mom says, ''Try your best--''</b>
<b>Try to get by me, doll.</b>
<b>''Doll''?</b>
<b>Don't ever call me...</b>
<b>...''doll.''</b>
<b>Nice shot.</b>
<b>There's the defense boy. l got you.</b>
<b>91 1 !</b>
<b>Pie? Pork chop?</b>
<b>Sorbet, perhaps?</b>
<b>Half-time.</b>
<b>Holy Putty Tat!</b>
<b>We're better than them.</b>
<b>We got them.</b>
<b>Moron Mountain, here we come.</b>
<b>We're going to be slaves.</b>
<b>There's a whole other half to play.</b>
<b>lt's the boss.</b>
<b>Hello, Mr. Swackhammer!</b>
<b>All right.</b>
<b>Not bad for the first half.</b>
<b>But we must keep this up.</b>
<b>No problem.</b>
<b>We stole talent from the NBA players!</b>
<b>From the NBA!</b>
<b>Shut up!</b>
<b>l smell something.</b>
<b>We've been playing hard.</b>
<b>Not you, you idiot!</b>
<b>lt's coming from over here.</b>
<b>That locker.</b>
<b>Look!</b>
<b>lt's the chubby boy!</b>
<b>lt smells like a...</b>
<b>...spy!</b>
<b>You guys need a publicist?</b>
<b>l can make you big.</b>
<b>-l know we're down.</b>
<b>-Let's hear the story.</b>
<b>l've been here before.</b>
<b>We can still win this.</b>
<b>lt's not over. We must come together.</b>
<b>We must believe in ourselves.</b>
<b>That'll help us.</b>
<b>Looks like Stan had a close</b>
<b>encounter with a bug-zapper.</b>
<b>The Monstars!</b>
<b>The Monstars!</b>
<b>That must hurt.</b>
<b>The Monstars!</b>
<b>The Monstars...</b>
<b>...stole the talent from the NBA players.</b>
<b>So that's what happened to them.</b>
<b>l think we should qui-- qui-- forfeit.</b>
<b>Listen, l didn't get dragged down</b>
<b>here to lose to ugly Monstars.</b>
<b>l ain't going out like that.</b>
<b>We're letting them push us!</b>
<b>We must fight back!</b>
<b>We must get right in their faces!</b>
<b>Well?</b>
<b>Are you with me or not?</b>
<b>Finished? Great speech and all.</b>
<b>You had them riveted.</b>
<b>But didn't you forget something?</b>
<b>Your secret stuff!</b>
<b>Nice deltoids!</b>
<b>Play along.</b>
<b>Stop hogging it.</b>
<b>We're teammates!</b>
<b>Secret stuff?</b>
<b>Secret stuff? You wouldn't</b>
<b>hold out on us, would you?</b>
<b>No.</b>
<b>l didn't think you needed it.</b>
<b>You're so tough. You're competitive.</b>
<b>We're also chicken. We need it bad.</b>
<b>-l'd like some of that.</b>
<b>-Could l have a sip, please?</b>
<b>This goes against everything</b>
<b>l learned in health class.</b>
<b>Do you want to win?</b>
<b>Bottoms up.</b>
<b>Yummy.</b>
<b>How about we go out</b>
<b>and kick some alien butt?</b>
<b>How about it? Ready?</b>
<b>Open!</b>
<b>Coming through!</b>
<b>Special delivery!</b>
<b>Nice kaboom.</b>
<b>Let's teach them a lesson.</b>
<b>Nice butt!</b>
<b>Going up!</b>
<b>Slammy!</b>
<b>Hello! A little surprise for you, my friends.</b>
<b>2 points.</b>
<b>This will be good.</b>
<b>Okay, birdie!</b>
<b>Time out!</b>
<b>Shut up, get away from me. Powwow!</b>
<b>We're right back in this game.</b>
<b>Let's play tough defense.</b>
<b>Why didn't you get him?</b>
<b>He's a baseball player.</b>
<b>A baseball player.</b>
<b>Looks like a basketball player to me.</b>
<b>Me too.</b>
<b>He's the one l want for Moron Mountain.</b>
<b>Are you talking to me?</b>
<b>Yeah, l am. You want a piece of me?</b>
<b>Come and get it!</b>
<b>What do you have in mind?</b>
<b>What about we raise the stakes?</b>
<b>lnteresting.</b>
<b>lf we win, you give the NBA</b>
<b>players their talent back.</b>
<b>But what if we win?</b>
<b>lf you win?</b>
<b>You get me.</b>
<b>Good deal.</b>
<b>Doc, you think that's a good idea?</b>
<b>You'll be our star attraction.</b>
<b>You'll sign autographs all day long.</b>
<b>And play one-on-one with</b>
<b>the paying customers.</b>
<b>And lose.</b>
<b>Do we have a deal?</b>
<b>Deal.</b>
<b>l don't think you should do this.</b>
<b>l have faith in my team.</b>
<b>Crush them!</b>
<b>Defeating time, boys.</b>
<b>Good-bye!</b>
<b>Fore!</b>
<b>But, Mommy,</b>
<b>l don't want to go to school today.</b>
<b>l want to stay home</b>
<b>and bake cookies with you.</b>
<b>l'm open!</b>
<b>Heads up!</b>
<b>Belly flop!</b>
<b>Oh, my!</b>
<b>ls this your man?</b>
<b>You okay?</b>
<b>Me? Oh, yeah. l'm fine.</b>
<b>Are you okay?</b>
<b>Thank you.</b>
<b>lt was nothing.</b>
<b>That was the nicest thing</b>
<b>anyone's ever done for me.</b>
<b>Time out.</b>
<b>l could have been a contender!</b>
<b>The Monstars! The Monstars!</b>
<b>l could have had a V-8!</b>
<b>We need a fifth player.</b>
<b>You got any more secret stuff?</b>
<b>l think it's starting to wear off.</b>
<b>lt didn't wear off. lt was water.</b>
<b>You guys had the ''special stuff''</b>
<b>inside you all along.</b>
<b>Yeah, l knew that. But you got any more?</b>
<b>Can l have some?</b>
<b>-Stan?</b>
<b>-Me?</b>
<b>You're center.</b>
<b>Just guard the big guy.</b>
<b>Guard him? l'll smother him!</b>
<b>l'll be all over him like a cheap suit!</b>
<b>l'll be on him like stink on rice!</b>
<b>He's going down!</b>
<b>Over here!</b>
<b>Over here!</b>
<b>l'm open!</b>
<b>Nice shot!</b>
<b>Big man, ain't he?</b>
<b>Let's get him out of here!</b>
<b>Oh, my!</b>
<b>How'd he do that?</b>
<b>Anyone can do that.</b>
<b>Even you.</b>
<b>Watch this.</b>
<b>No sweat. This is Looney Tune Land.</b>
<b>10 seconds to go?</b>
<b>Thanks for telling me, doc.</b>
<b>l hate to be the bearer of bad news,</b>
<b>Your Airness...</b>
<b>...but if you don't find a fifth player,</b>
<b>your team will forfeit the game.</b>
<b>Forfeit?</b>
<b>Precisely, Sir Altitude.</b>
<b>No way. We'll find someone.</b>
<b>l didn't know Dan Ackroyd</b>
<b>was in this picture!</b>
<b>Perhaps l could be of some assistance?</b>
<b>That's our fifth guy.</b>
<b>Now you get to live your dream. Let's go.</b>
<b>-We need to score 2 points.</b>
<b>-Here's how l see it.</b>
<b>You kick it to the girl</b>
<b>bunny down in the post.</b>
<b>You dish it to Bugs.</b>
<b>You swing it to Mike. You go to the hole.</b>
<b>-And dominate!</b>
<b>-We're on defense!</b>
<b>l don't play defense.</b>
<b>Typical.</b>
<b>You must listen to Mike on this.</b>
<b>Someone steal the ball,</b>
<b>get it to me and l'll score.</b>
<b>Don't lose that confidence!</b>
<b>Paws and wings in here! Okay!</b>
<b>This is why l was born.</b>
<b>l thrive on pressure.</b>
<b>Excuse me, sorry.</b>
<b>Easy on the trousers, Daf.</b>
<b>Pardon me. Mr. Murray,</b>
<b>something's really been bugging me.</b>
<b>Just how did you get here?</b>
<b>Producer's a friend of mine.</b>
<b>Had a teamster drop me off.</b>
<b>That's how it goes.</b>
<b>You see this chunky fellow?</b>
<b>That's good!</b>
<b>Let's do it!</b>
<b>Play fair.</b>
<b>Don't choke now. Come on.</b>
<b>lt's gut-check time!</b>
<b>This must be mine.</b>

<b>Bring it on, dude.</b>
<b>You're mine!</b>
<b>l'm open!</b>
<b>Never mind.</b>
<b>The Tunes win!</b>
<b>Nice pass.</b>
<b>Great stretch at the basket too.</b>
<b>You really got some skills.</b>
<b>You could play in the NBA.</b>
<b>Thanks, Mike.</b>
<b>l'll probably quote you on that.</b>
<b>But l'm going to take this opportunity</b>
<b>to retire from the game.</b>
<b>Come on.</b>
<b>No,</b>
<b>l'm going to retire right now and that's it.</b>
<b>l'm going to go out undefeated.</b>
<b>That's how it will be.</b>
<b>-You go celebrate.</b>
<b>-Come with us.</b>
<b>l'd like to, but l have to ice down my</b>
<b>knees now. They're starting to go.</b>
<b>Good-bye.</b>
<b>See you.</b>
<b>You sure?</b>
<b>Yes. Definitely sure. Definitely.</b>
<b>-Losers!</b>
<b>-Sorry.</b>
<b>-Choke artists!</b>
<b>-Sorry again.</b>
<b>Wait till l get you back</b>
<b>on Moron Mountain.</b>
<b>The party's over! Get in the spaceship.</b>
<b>Why do you take that?</b>
<b>Because he's bigger.</b>

<b>Than we used...</b>
<b>...to be.</b>
<b>What're you doing?</b>
<b>-Wait! What are you doing? Wait!</b>
<b>-Come here.</b>
<b>Had it in you all the time.</b>
<b>One thing. Pass me the ball, Bugs.</b>
<b>Give my friends their talent back.</b>
<b>Do we have to?</b>
<b>lt's part of the deal. Touch the ball.</b>
<b>Fair is fair.</b>
<b>Touch it.</b>
<b>That was so much fun.</b>
<b>l feel so...</b>
<b>...insignificant.</b>
<b>My clothes don't fit.</b>
<b>What a trip!</b>
<b>l'm up for another!</b>
<b>Can we ask you a favor, Mr. Bunny?</b>
<b>We don't want to go back.</b>
<b>-We hate it there.</b>
<b>-lt stinks.</b>
<b>l was thinking, could we stay here?</b>
<b>Please!</b>
<b>Oh, brother.</b>

<b>Looney enough?</b>

<b>No way, Jose.</b>
<b>You want your talent back? Just touch it.</b>

This is cool. Uh huh huh...
Ow. Cut it out, butt-hole.
BUTT-HEAD: Whoa!
Aah!
Uh huh huh huh...
Uh, hey, baby. Uh huh.
I'm, like, pretty tall.
Uh huh huh...
Damn it, cut it out.
I'm trying to score.
Nah! Yah!
Look at you, you bung-holes.
Uh huh...
Hey, baby, how's it goin'?
- Hey!
- No way, Beavis. I saw her first.
Damn it. I'm gonna kick your ass.
Damn it, Beavis.
I saw her first. Get outta here.
Hey, Butt-head.
Butt-head! Wake up!
Uh... uh... Damn it, Beavis,
I was about to score.
But check it out. It's gone.
- Mm mm mm...
- Uh... What?
- The TV! Mm mm mm...
- Uh... Oh, yeah.
Uh huh huh... Well, where is it?
I don't know.
I just woke up and it was gone.
And look, the window's broken.
We'll get 100 bucks for this.
Heh heh heh.
- No...
- Hmm. Uh huh huh huh...
- Uhh...
- Oh, no...
- Ohh...
- Uhh...
Uh huh huh huh...
- Ohh...
- Uhh...
Uh huh huh... Uhh...
I think I just figured something out, Beavis.
W-w-what? Mm mm, heh...
This sucks. Uh huh huh...
Yeah, it really sucks.
Heh heh heh...
This sucks more than anything that has ever sucked before.
We must find this butt-hole that took our TV.
Yeah. Yeah!
# ISAAC HAYES: A couple of mean guys with fire in their eyes
# Known by the names of
# CHORUS: Beavis and Butt-head!
# ISAAC HAYES: Yeah
# They'll chew you up and spit you out, beyond a doubt
# It pays not to mess with
# CHORUS: Beavis and Butt-head!
# ISAAC HAYES: You got it
# If you cross Beavis and Butt-head
# They will throw down and blow your ass away
# Y'know what I'm sayin'?
# Beavis and Butt-head!
# Beavis and Butt-head
BUTT-HEAD: Huh huh huh...
# Ahh, yes
It's not in here.
What are we gonna do, Butt-head?
- What if we never find it?
- Settle down, Beavis.
Wait a minute. I don't wanna go to school. We gotta find our TV.
Shut up, Beavis. I got an idea.
Uh huh huh huh...
Let's just wheel this thing back to the house.
Uh huh... yeah.
Uh, hey, excuse me, boys.
What's going on here?
Someone stole our TV.
We're just gonna use this one.
Get outta the way.
I'm afraid that TV belongs to the school, mm-kay?
This could be a really positive experience for you guys.
There's a wonderful and exciting world out there when we discover that we don't need TV to entertain us.
He said anus. Uh huh huh huh...
Entertain us... anus. Oh, yeah.
Have you guys heard a word I've said?
Uh, yeah. Anus.
Yeah, yeah. Heh heh...
Yeah, I heard it, too.
Look, guys, just take the TV back to the A/V room right now.
And try to be a little more open to life experiences, mm-kay?
What a dork.
Get it over here...
Ow. No!
- Aah!
- That was cool.
- No, it wasn't.
- Uh... oh, yeah.
Uh, what's going on out here?
Oh, no!
Uh, that belongs to the school.
It's supposed to be in the A/V room.
- Wasn't our fault.
- Get back here!
Beavis and Butt-head, you're both expelled!
Cool.
Whoa, check it out, Beavis.
I didn't know Anderson had a camper.
Yeah. Maybe it has a TV.
Oh, hello. Are you boys here to look at the refrigerator?
Uhh, no.
We're here to look at the TV.
Tom didn't tell me it was broken. Go on in.
- Cool.
- Heh heh heh.
Well, that ought to hold her.
You know, the most important thing you can have on a camper is a good butane regulator, and this here's the best one they make.
I hope we can fix that fridge.
Marcy, we've been plannin' for this trip our whole lives...
- And we're gonna go...
- Da-da-da...
What in the hell is that?
Dah... dah... da-da-dah
Ah, must be them damn buzzard hawks.
Let's get something to drink.
Ahh.
Aah! This crap is warm.
Beavis, you butt-hole, you broke it.
Aah, no, no, damn it!
Hey, what the hell's goin' on here?
- They're here to fix the TV.
- What? The TV ain't broken.
Uh... yeah, it is.
Yeah. Heh... heh heh...
Hey, wait a minute.
You two look kind of familiar.
Ain't you them kids that have been whackin' off in my tool shed?
Uh huh huh...
We still don't have a TV, Butt-head.
I know, Beavis.
And damn it,
I can't sleep without a TV.
BUTT-HEAD: Dumb-ass.
H-help. Help me.
No... no...
What's your problem, Beavis?
Uhh... I need TV.
I need TV now! Damn it!
Whoa. TV.
Yeah, yeah. TV. Heh heh.
TV! Yeah.
Unh... unh... damn it.
Uhh... no.
Damn it!
You sure these guys can pull this off, Earl?
It's gotta look like an accident.
Ohh! Oh, yeah.
Ohh...
Uh huh huh...
Ohh...
Beavis and Butt-head, y-you little bastards!
Can we watch your TV?
No! Y-you're expelled.
Now, get outta here!
Wait a minute. Damn it!
I need a TV now.
We're missing everything.
Yeah, hold on a minute.
That must be them now.
Yeah, I'll call you back. Come in!
Ahh...
TV. Yeah.
You're late. (COUGHS)
Really? Did we miss Baywatch?
Earl said you guys were young, but, jeez...
As long as you can get the job done.
What are your names?
Uh, Butt-head. Uh huh...
Oh, I mean, Beavis. Heh heh heh...
That's OK. I'd rather not know your names, anyway. Mine's Muddy.
I'm gonna get right to the point.
I'll pay you ten grand plus expenses, payable after you do her.
Uhh... do her?
That's right - do her.
I'm offering you $10,000 plus expenses to do my wife.
We got a deal?
Um, actually, we just want to watch TV.
Shut up, Beavis.
Uhh... yeah, we'll do your wife.
N-no! I wanna watch TV.
Aah!
Damn it, Beavis, you butt-munch.
This guy wants us to score with his wife, and he's gonna pay us.
We can buy a new TV.
Heh heh. Really? Heh heh. Cool.
Uhh, huh huh... we'll do it, sir.
Well, all right, then.
Let's get down to business.
Here she is, boys.
Her name's Dallas.
She ain't as sweet as she looks.
She stole everything from me.
Watch out. She'll do you faster than you do her.
Whoa. Uh huh... cool.
Heh heh. Yeah.
She's in her room in Vegas.
I got you one next to hers.
Your flight leaves in an hour.
I'll drive you to the airport.
Holed up.
Uh huh huh...
Hole.
Can we watch some TV first?
No.
Now, listen to me.
This is real important.
My wife's got this leather satchel.
A black bag, this big.
I need it back, boys.
Sentimental value, you know what I mean?
Any questions so far?
Uhh, does she have big hooters?
Heh heh. Yeah, she sure does.
Uh huh... this is gonna be cool.
Y-y-yeah. Boi-yoi-yoi-ing.
Heh heh heh...
You guys are funny.
Let's have a drink on it, huh?
Now, don't let me down.
We're gonna get paid to score.
Yeah. Then we're gonna get a big-screen TV... with 2 remotes.
Beavis, this is the greatest day of our lives.
Yeah.
Here you are.
Hey, Beavis, she touched my butt.
Hello there.
Are you two headin' for Las Vegas?
Yeah. We're gonna score.
Oh. Well, I hope to score big there myself.
I'm mostly gonna be doin' the slots.
Yeah, yeah. I'm hoping to do some sluts, too.
Do they have lots of sluts in Vegas?
There's so many slots you won't know where to begin.
Whoa. Hey, Butt-head, this chick is pretty cool.
She says there's tons of sluts in Vegas.
Cool. Uh huh...
It's so nice to meet young men who are so well-mannered.
I'm gonna have money and a big-screen TV, and there's gonna be sluts everywhere.
- It's gonna rule.
- Oh, that's nice.
CAPTAIN: 'Look to the front of the cabin for safety instructions.'
ATTENDANT:
'To fasten your seat belt,
'insert the free end into the coupling... '
"Insert." Uh huh huh...
Uhh... hmm.
Damn it!
Uhh...
Hi. Can I help you with that?
- There. All set.
- I love you. Uh huh...
Hey, cut it out.
I want HER to do it.
Uh huh... come to Butt-head.
CAPTAIN: 'Flight attendants, prepare for take-off.'
Nn! Damn it.
Hey, wait a minute. What's going on?
Aah! We're gonna die!
Aah! We're all gonna die!
Come to Butt-heaaaah...
Uhh, could you, like, do that thing with my belt again?
Yeah. This is her.
Oh, she looks lovely.
I'm probably going to make out with her first before we, uh... you know, heh heh, get down.
I'm sorry.
You have to speak up, son.
I have this ringin' in my ears.
My doctor says it could be related to my heart palpitations.
Heh. Really? I poop too much.
Ooh.
Maybe you're lactose-intolerant.
No, no. I poop too much!
And then I get tired.
Tired? Oh, well,
I know all about tired, dear.
I have just the thing for ya.
Take a couple of these.
They perk me right up.
Thanks.
Tastes like crap. What else ya got?
Oh, go right ahead. Help yourself.
So, uhh, huh huh... goin' to Las Vegas?
Yi-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai...
Hi. We're serving dinner now.
Our selections tonight are chicken piccata or seafood gumbo.
- Piccata! Titicaca!
- Does the gumbo have corn?
I am Cornholio.
I need piccata for my bung-hole.
You'll have to wait.
Are you threatening me?
My bung-hole will not wait.
Heh heh. Bungholio.
Uhh, hey, I got a beer.
Want some? Uh huh...
I am Cornholio!
Aah! Aah!
Aah...
Get outta the cockpit!
- Uh huh. You said...
- Now!
PA: 'Welcome to Las Vegas.'
Uhh...
This is Las Vegas?
Yeah. I thought there'd be casinos and lights and stuff.
This isn't very good.
Hey, Butt-head, why is that guy holding a sign?
Uhh... maybe he's blind.
Uh huh. Check this out.
Ahem. Excuse me. Heh heh.
You guys know where I can find these guys?
Oh.
Uhh, Be-a... Be-ave?
Um, Buh... Boo...
Boot? Someone named Boot?
This says Beavis.
And Boot-head.
Uhh... that's Butt-head.
Don't you get it, Beavis?
These dudes have the same name as us.
Whoa, really? We should party.
(SIGHS) This way, sirs.
Where are those guys?
Where the hell is he?
You sure this is the right place?
You Muddy?
What are you, cops?
No. Earl sent us, you know, to take care of your wife.
What? Take care...
What the hell are you talkin' about?
- Who were the other two clowns?
- Huh?
God damn it! She did it again!
I'm going to Vegas to kill all three of them!
I noticed your TV was broken.
Wanna buy a new one?
Just leave it.
Worthless piece of crap.
Really, man. We gotta start stealin' from rich people.

I'm sorry about that little misunderstanding, gentlemen.
We didn't realise you were registered guests.
If there's anything we can do to...
Mm! Damn it!
This thing is stuck.
Uh, sir, it's attached to the...
You dumb-ass. Let me try.
Uh huh huh.
Hey, check it out.
That guy's still standing there.
Ahem.
Uhh... could you, like, not stand there and stuff?
- Some people are dumb.
- Yeah, really.
Uhh... check it out, Beavis.
I wonder where this goes.
Uhh... huh huh.
Whoa. I think I hear a chick.
Really? Cool! Neat!
Ow!
All right, who are you?
CIA, FBI, ATF?
Hey, Butt-head, it's her!
- Whoa!
- Yeah!
Uh... huh huh huh, hey, baby...
Are we, like, gonna do it?
You got 2 seconds.
Uhh... huh huh...
Is that gonna be enough time?
- Who sent you?
- Uh, this drunk dude.
He said he was gonna pay us to do you.
Muddy... Son of a bitch.
Hold it. What's he paying you?
Uhh... 10, uhh...
10 grand? That cheap ass.
I got a better deal. I'll double it.
I'll pay you 20 to go back and do him.
Uh, you want us to do a guy? No way.
I don't know, Butt-head.
That is a lot of money.
We could close our eyes and pretend he's a chick... Aah!
DALLAS: Damn.
You two wait right there.
Uh... huh huh huh.
I'm ready for love.
Yeah! I don't believe this.
Hmm.
Yeah, Las Vegas.
Give me the number for Dream America tours.
Right.
Uh huh huh. Uh huh huh.
Yeah. You got a bus leaving today?
Where's it going?
Washington DC.
5 minutes? Perfect.
Give me 2 tickets.
No way, Butt-head.
You're always first.
Damn it, Beavis, we've never done this before.
Oh, uhh... huh huh...
Wanna... you know... Uh huh huh...
Do it? Heh heh.
Hey, we're finally gonna score!
Do it?
BEAVIS: Ow!
You guys wanna... score? Oh, ho ho.
BEAVIS: Damn it!
Ow! Cut it out!
You wait here.
- Bunghole!
- Damn it! Ow! Aah!
Aah!
Uh... huh huh huh.
- Aah!
- Uh... huh huh huh.
No!
Aah! Aah! Aah!
DALLAS: Ahem!
BEAVIS: Aah!
Don't wear yourselves out, boys.
Save some energy for me.
- Uh huh huh huh.
- Hm hm, heh heh.
This is it, Beavis.
We're finally gonna score.
Heh heh... Thank God.
Yeah. We're gonna do it, all right.
- Uh, huh... Uh, huh...
- Oh, yeah! Eh, heh...
DALLAS: Ahem!
Boys... boys...
Boys!
First, you have to do a little job for me. Would you like to?
Here's what it is.
I want you to take the bus to Washington. That's all.
And when you get there,
I'll be waiting.
You're gonna make a whole lot of money, and I'm gonna give you everything.
- Uh huh huh...
- Hm, heh heh...
Until then, keep your pants on.
Now, your bus is downstairs waiting, so get going.
- Uh huh huh...
- Hm, heh heh...
Let's go!
On three!
This is gonna be cool.
Can't wait. Heh heh.
Ow.
Get outta there, Beavis.
I want the window.
Why don't ya take turns?
Look, Butt-head.
It's that slut from the plane.
Oh, why, it's you two.
How d'you do in Las Vegas?
Um, we didn't score yet.
Oh, well, I'm sorry to hear that.
Me, I took a beatin'!
Cool.
So that's why
I'm bussin' it across America.
I'm so glad you're here.
Jim, Jim!
I want you to meet two nice boys.
Uh... oh...
This is Travis and Bob.
What's your last name, dear?
Uhh, Head.
My first name's Butt. Uh huh huh.
Agent Flemming, ATF.
Are you gonna tell us where it is, or shall Agent Hurly give you another cavity search?
Is that a promise?
Look, Mrs Scum, we know who you are.
Tell her, Bork.
Dallas Grimes, married to Muddy Grimes.
You run a mom-and-pop arms smuggling ring.
- Mmm. You got my bad side.
- Three days ago, you pulled a job at the Army
Research Facility in Hadley, Nevada, where you stole the X-5 unit.
We know you had it when you checked in, so tell us where it is?
You gonna charge me?
I didn't think so.
You wanna let me go, or wait till I file a wrongful arrest?
We got nothing. We can only hold her another couple of hours.
Damn it! Cut her loose.
Where's that damn unit?
BUTT-HEAD:
Uh huh huh huh. We're in Washington.
BEAVIS:
Yeah, yeah. We're gonna score now.
OLD LADY: Actually, son, we're at the Hoover Dam.
BEAVIS:
Um, no, no. We're in Washington!
BUTT-HEAD: Yeah.
We're gonna score now!
Over 40,000 tons of concrete were used to build the Hoover Dam.
From top to bottom, the dam is 51 stories.
It has a maximum capacity for generating...
- Wow. Really?
- 2.074 Megawatts of electricity, but on average, it generates about 25% of that.
BEAVIS: I'll be damned.
Does anybody know how much energy it takes to power Vegas?
Um, yeah, I just have a question.
Is this a God dam?
Uh huh huh.
You know, God damn. You know?
GUIDE: If you'll follow me this way.
BUTT-HEAD: This is dumb.
Let's go find that chick.
Yeah. Enough of this crap.
Whoa. Check it out, Butt-head. TV!
Cool.
I gotta hit the head.
Can you get me some coffee?
All right.
Talk to me, Bork.
A witness saw two teenagers leaving Dallas's room shortly before we arrived.
Did he get a full cavity search?
Uh... the witness?
You can never be too careful, Bork.
I didn't think it was necessary.
We have a picture from the elevator.
Here. Have a look.
What the hell?
They look like a couple of kids,
Chief.
Don't you know what kids are capable of?
Don't you read the papers?
What the...
Damn it!
All they have is these shows about water.
Yeah, really.
They need some shows about fire.
- Uhh, what are you doing, Beavis?
- Something's wrong with my butt.
Your butt sucks.
Hey, how come there's no sound?
Uhh... I'll fix it.
Uhh...
Yeah, yeah! There you go.
Louder! Louder!
Uh, huh... Hmm... Huh huh...
Mas... ter... a...
Masturbation? Uh huh huh huh!
You know, I'll tell you what.
It doesn't get any better than this.
This here is God's country.
Unspoiled and...
Aaaaah!
Uhh...
I think I found the remote.
What the hell's going on?
I swear, that's all I know.
They got on a tour bus heading west.
Uhh! Please...
I'm gonna kill 'em!
That was boring.
Yeah, yeah. Just the same thing, over and over again.
Uhh, wait a minute.
We can't leave Washington till we find that chick.
Oh, we're a long way from Washington, Bob.
This is the Hoover Dam.
Dam. I'll be damned. Heh heh.
You boys better show up.
- See that, Bork?
- I don't get it.
You got half the state after you.
How do you get away?
Cut the power!
Damn right.
We're dealing with pros here.
My opinion - terrorists. What's the scoop on that stolen unit?
Well, sir, it's not good.
Roll the tape.
The X-5 unit is a new top-secret biological weapon.
A man-made virus, the deadliest known to man.
It could wipe out five states in five days.
Here's what happened when it was tested on army recruits.
Look at these guys, Chief.
This thing is a veritable Doomsday device.
Jesus jumped-up Christ!
If it falls into the wrong hands...
It gets worse.
The unit wasn't finished.
It has a flaw - the casing.
If hit hard, it could open, releasing the virus.
As of now, these are the most dangerous men in America.
I want these faces in front of every
Fed and sheriff within 1,000 miles.
The orders are dead or alive.
Let's just pray that nothing hits that unit.
Ow! Ow!
Cut it out!
Get outta the way.
I wanna sit by the window.
OK, people, next stop: Grand Canyon.
# AC/DC: Gone Shootin'

- Hm hm, heh heh heh...
Like, it's coming out of his ass, but it's, like, also coming out of the ass of the ass.

RANGER: There are over 200 active geysers in Yellowstone Park.
Old Faithful here is one of the largest.
During an eruption, the water can reach as high as 200 feet.
- So?
- Hm hm, heh heh.
Uh, the geyser shoots out over 12,000 gallons of water in a single eruption.
That's not that much.
Yeah, really. Let's get outta here.
If you'll just step over here, the geyser is seconds away...
Ooh, it's incredible.
Oh, oh, yeah. That's amazing.
It's incredible.
That's amazing.
- Uh huh huh huh.
- Hm hm, heh heh.
- Uh huh huh huh.
- Hm hm, heh heh.
(SIGHS) Can't wait forever.
Damn kids. No respect.
Don't appreciate anything.
Oh, my God!
Wait! Stop!
Darn it.
Get me the police.
- Uh huh.
- Hm, heh.
This is the coolest thing
I have ever seen.
We got 'em.
They're on a bus on Highway 89.
Ah... heh... yeah, that was great.
Yeah.
Uhh... is this the right bus?
Um... heh heh.
Uh huh huh huh.
Hey, Beavis, we're on a bus with chicks.
Hey, baby.
- They're not on the bus.
- These people know something.
I want full cavity searches.
- Everyone. Go deep on 'em.
- Agent Hurly.
I tell you, Bork, these guys are smart, damn smart.
They're probably a hundred miles away by now.
Uh huh huh.
Butt-head, this book kicks ass.
There's a talking snake, and a naked chick, and then this dude puts a leaf on his schlong.
Cool.
Uhh... uhh...
Ow!
- Uh huh huh.
- Hm, heh heh.
Check it out, Butt-head - porta-potties.
Cool. I gotta take a dump.
- Uh huh huh huh.
- Hm hm, heh heh.
BUTT-HEAD: Uhh... where's the toilet?
Forgive me, Father. I've sinned.
I slept with a woman, and, uh...
BUTT-HEAD: Really?
Uh huh huh. Was she naked?
Well, yes, Father.
Please forgive me.
Cool! Uh huh huh.
Could you, like, see her boobs?
Uh huh huh huh.
Uh, I'm sorry. How many Hail Marys?
BEAVIS: A thousand! Heh...
And I want you to hit yourself!
Right now!
- Uh, now?
- Yeah... do it!
Yeah! Harder! Do it again!
(WHACK) Oww! Aah!
- Uh huh huh huh.
- Hm hm, heh heh.
Heh... hm hm.
RECORDING: 'Welcome to the petrified forest,
'the world's largest site of petrified wood.'
- Uh huh huh.
- Hm, heh heh.
"Wood." Uh huh huh!
RECORDING: 'You may wonder,
"how can wood get so hard?"'
- Uh huh huh.
- Hm, heh heh.
RECORDING: 'The wood became hard over 2 million years ago.'
Uh huh huh huh.
Hm hm, heh heh.
- Uh huh huh.
- Heh heh.
- Uh huh huh huh.
- Hm hm, heh heh.
"Wood." Uh huh huh...
Hey, where'd those chicks go?
I think you scared them off.
This sucks. What are we doing here?
Uhh... I don't know.
Uhh, do you know where Washington is?
Uh, yeah.
About 2,000 miles that way.
- Cool.
- Thanks.
Didn't see which way they went or their vehicle.
I don't suppose you tried to stop them.
The most dangerous guys in America?
No, thanks. I make $9 an hour.
National security is the responsibility of every American.
- Bork...
- Cavity search?
- Deep and hard.
- Agent Hurly.
They're not getting away.
I want roadblocks - every road out of here for 200 miles.
Um... this sucks.
It's all hot and stuff.
This desert is stupid.
They need to put a drinking fountain out here.
Yeah, like, a 7-Eleven or something. Heh.
Somethin' wrong, Officer?
We're looking for these fugitives.
Well, I'll be danged.
That's them kids that have been whackin' in my camper.
- You saw them?
- Sure.
Boy, I never seen two kids do so much damned whackin'.
Blue Den, this is post 9.
I have positive ID.
They're like two spider monkeys...
Step out of the vehicle, please.
Wait a minute. Me and the missus are on our way to Washington...
Now!
Now, wait right there.
You're dealing with a veteran of two foreign wars.
They're the ones been whackin'.
I find anything broken, you and I'll tangle.
Masturbating in the man's camper.
We're dealing with two sick individuals.
I want that camper torn apart, full cavity searches all around.
Something tells me he could be involved.
What in the... Wait just a minute!
Chief, 2 days ago,
Express Airways had a disturbance by someone calling himself
"Cornholio".
Guess who matches the description?
Finally, a real break.
Get me the departure point.
We'll kick ass.
- Uh huh huh.
- Nuhn.
- Uh huh huh...
- Hm hm, heh.
Uhh...
Uhh huh... hey!
One of you bastards got a match?
Uhh, yeah. My butt and your... uhh... butt. Uh huh huh.
Uh huh huh. Uh huh.
- Uh huh huh.
- Hm, heh heh.
- Hm hm, heh heh.
- Uh huh huh huh.
Here's a song that might help you cope with those feelings, mm-kay?
It's called Lesbian Seagull.
# She flies so gracefully
# Over rocks, trees and sand
# Soaring over cliffs
# And gently floating down to land
# She proudly lifts her voice
# To sound the mating call
# And soon her mate responds
# By singing, "caw"
# "Caw, caw"
# Come with me
# Lesbian seagull
# Settle down and rest with me
# Fly high
# Lesbian seagull... #
Uh, that's him!
He's their teacher!
Uh, huh, yeah.
Uh, what's going on here?
I'll ask the questions.
Are these your students?
I assume you're a government agent.
I would think you would know there is something in this country called due process, mm-kay?
That's the talk I'd expect from the guy who taught these two.
Take this scum away.
I believe I'm supposed to be read my Miranda rights.
Now... Whaa!
I always knew they were no good.
Uh, I hate...
Shut up! You've been harbouring two criminal masterminds.
Chief, you know that guy whose camper they were whackin' off in?
Bork, you are a federal agent.
You represent the United States Government.
Never end a sentence with a preposition.
Oh. Uh...
You know that guy in whose camper they...
I mean that guy off in whose camper they were whacking?
That's better. Yes?
We've run a sample through the criminal sperm bank and found two possible genetic matches for a father.
Former Mötley Crüe roadies turned drifters.
- You were a roadie for Mötley Crüe?
- Yep. Uh huh huh huh.
Aha... fire.
Uh, here's another true story.
About 15 years ago, we stopped in this toilet... uhh, called Highland.
Really? That's where we're from.
Then you know what I'm talking about.
Anyway, here's the story.
I scored with these two chicks.
True story.
Heh heh heh. Yeah. Me, too.
You scored with two chicks?
Yeah. They were sluts.
- Aah!
- Shut up, dumb-ass!
You didn't score.
I scored with both of 'em.
Uh, do you think these two sluts still live in Highland?
That would be cool.
Hey, you want to see something really cool?
Uh huh huh huh.
BEAVIS: Fire!
Ahh...
Uhh...
Hmm. Where'd those guys go? Yeah.
Um...
Are we almost there yet?
Uhh... probably, like, another five minutes or something.
- The sun sucks.
- Yeah.
Cut it out, butt-hole!
Hey, Butt-head.
Isn't there supposed to be, like, water in cactuses?
Uhh...
Hey, Beavis... check it out.
- Uh huh huh.
- Heh heh heh.
Well, no, I can't say that I've seen them, Officer.
- I hope it's safe to drive here.
- Stick to the main roads.
They're probably hiding out in the desert.
Well, that's good to know, Officer.
Yeah. (COUGHS)
Oh...
Hey, Butt-head, are we gonna die?
Uhh... uhh... probably.
Whoa!
I think my life is, like, flashing in front of my eyes.
Whoa...
My life was cool.
Mm mm, oh, yeah...
Wait a minute.
I think I'm seeing something, too.
It's, like, a really long time ago.
Heh heh heh.
Yeah. This is gonna be cool.
Hey, how's it going?
Aah!
Mm mm, heh heh.
Yeah. I scored.
Hey, Butt-head,
I'm starting to feel weird.
I think I'm freaking out.
Uh... OK.
Whoa, this is cool.
It's like, it's like everything looks all weird...
There're all these weird shapes...
And it's sort of like... it's like a music video.
What are you doing,
Butt-head? Stop it!
You're freaking me out! Cut it out!
What's going on?
# WHITE ZOMBIE: Ratfinks,

Ohh!
Oh, yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Fire! Fire! Fire!
Oh, yes!
- Aah!
- Aah! I'm all wet!
- Uhh...
- Oh, hey, cool.
Yeah. Water.
Oh, I'm gonna enjoy this.
Any last words before I kill you?
Uhh...
I have a couple.
Butt cheeks.
Yeah, yeah! And, um, and boobs.
I just wanna say that again. Boobs.
I'm gonna blow you both to hell!
Cool. Whoa.
Beavis, that's that dude that's paying us to do his wife.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Um, can you just take us to Washington?
We're gonna meet her there and, you know...
Washington? That's where she's gonna meet up with you?
You know, I just might need you boys after all.
Get in the trunk. Both of you. Now!
BUTT-HEAD:
Boy, it sure is hard to score.
BEAVIS: Yeah, really.
Hey, hey, Butt-head, check it out. Ajack.
- Uh huh huh.
- Heh heh heh.

- Uh huh huh.
- Heh heh heh.
Yeah.
- Uh huh huh.
- Heh heh heh.
Let's get out of here.
You go first, Beavis.
I don't know, Butt-head.
The road's moving pretty fast.
Come on, Beavis. Start running really fast when you hit the ground.
- It'll work.
- No way. You go.
Don't be a wuss, Beavis.
Aah!
Uh huh huh.
That was cool.
Unh! Unh! Unh!
Boy, what I wouldn't give for five minutes alone with them two little bastards.
Aah!
MEDIC: I need a trauma box over here right now!
The news here is not good.
Authorities call this the worst highway disaster in history.
'Behind me, over 400 vehicles lay wrecked or stuck.'
Chief, look!
'No one knows what caused it... '
Well, I'll be a blue-nosed gopher.
Where did these guys come from?
The question is where are they going?
TV: 'ln other news,
G-PAC begins at 2 pm tomorrow,
'when representatives from around the world... '
What the hell?
Bork! That bus we picked up, where was it heading?
Uh, DC, Chief.
Jesus jumped-up...
Bork, can you imagine what would happen if they set that thing off in the capital?
If they sold it to someone at that conference? It's not gonna happen!
Whoa!
- This kicks ass.
- Yeah.
Yoo-hoo! Travis and Bob Head!
Hellooo!
- Butt-head, it's that chick.
- Uh, oh, yeah. Cool.
Maybe they'll take us to Washington, and we can finally score.
Yeah.
Um, isn't Seattle in Washington?
Uh, yep. It sure is.
Cool. I was thinking after we score, maybe we could go see Hole.
BUTT-HEAD: Hole.
Hmm.
MUDDY: Expecting somebody?
Well, well, look at this.

Honey, I was gonna split it after I sold it.

Come on, Muddy, how about we just forget about it and get a room like old times?
I don't think so. Where is it?

- Can I help you?
- Uh...
We're looking for Washington?
We're gonna meet this chick with really big hooters.
Sirs, you are in Washington.
Really? Well, where is she?
Uh, could you make an announcement that we're ready to score?
No.
(BEEP) Just a moment.
Hello? How may I help you?
BUTT-HEAD ON PA: 'Uh... attention.
'Attention. We're looking for the chick with big boobs.'
BEAVIS: 'Yeah! Yeah! '
'We are ready to do you now.'
BOTH: 'Uh huh huh huh.'
SENATORS: Uh huh huh huh.
You forget who you're dealing with, honey.
I got your mules right here in my trunk, and...
Hey! Oh, damn! Damn!
I am gonna kill them!
No, honey...
We'regonna kill them.
DRIVER: Next stop, White House.
Hey! What's going on?
Why are we back on the bus?
It's time to go, son.
We can't leave!
We never met that chick! Damn it!
We were supposed to get some!
Settle down, Beavis.
No! I won't settle down!
Not this time!
Damn it! This always happens!
I think I'm gonna score, then never score! It's not fair!
We travelled, um, um... 100 miles
'cause we thought we'd score!
It's not gonna happen! Damn it!
- Buddy, sit down!
- Shut up, asswipe!
I'm sick and tired of this!
We're never gonna score!
It's not gonna happen!
We'll get old like these people!
- But they've probably scored!
- Hey! Sit down!
It's, like, this chick's a slut!
And this guy's old, but he's scored a million times!
Oh, yeah.
But not us! We're never gonna score!
We're never gonna score!
Right! That's it, numb-nuts!
Aah!
BEAVIS: Once more and I'll... Unh!
Kick your ass!
Well, look what we have here.
You two make me sick.
Book 'em, Bork.
You don't have anything on us.
Oh, I don't? How about lewd conduct?
Maybe indecent exposure.
Here's what's gonna happen.
One of you is gonna get me the unit.
The other gets 60 years in jail.
That's where you're wrong, boy.
We're back together, and you'll never...
He stole the unit!
Said he put it in some kid's pants.
Why you damn little four-legged...
Hey! Take it easy!
I'm gonna rip your...
Now, Travis, it doesn't do a body good to get all worked up.
Here, this should help you relax.
Does that say "Xanax"?
Um, yeah.
Probably. I don't know.
What else you got in there?
Gimme that thing!
Waah!
Our suspects are on a tour bus heading for... the White House?
Jumping Jesus!
I want everyone there!
Our people. Locals.
Orders are shoot to kill.
Ngaah!
Yeah, yeah, heh heh, you know what's really cool?
Butt-head. Butt-head.
- Shut up, Beavis.
- Yeah. Ooh. Eeh.
Hey, Butt-head! Hey, Butt-head!
...l'll be your tour guide.
If you don't know, today's a very special day.
Gathered at the White House today for an historic global conference called
"Give Peace A Chance" or "G-PAC" are representatives from around the world.
BEAVIS: Ngaaahh!
GUIDE: This is the East Room.
Many of these portraits were saved from the fire
- set by the British in 1814...
- Fire! Fire! (GIBBERISH)
What's your problem, Beavis?
Weeahh!
The site for the White House was chosen by President Washington and Pierre L'Enfant.
L'enfentata!
L'enfentata titicaca for my bunghole!
- Bunghole!
- Sir?
Sir, are you OK?
Are you threatening me?
I am Cornholio!
OK... uh... sir, maybe you should wait out in the lobby?
Um, OK.
In this lobby, will there be TP?
For my bunghole?
- Cornholio... heh, heh.
- The room was originally...
Boy, where are you when we need you, lke?
You know, honey, even with all we've been through, it don't change a thing.
I've said it before, and I'll say it again.
This is the greatest country on Earth, and...
Say, that looks kind of like... naw, it couldn't be.
BEAVIS: Bungholio!
Are you threatening me?
I am Cornholio!
Yes, the President does plan to speak today at the G-PAC conference.
Mr Secretary! Mr Secretary!
What about the rumours that a biological weapon has been stolen and smuggled out of the country during this conference?
Those rumours are entirely unfounded.
Those rumours are totally unfounded.
I am the great Cornholio!
I am a gringo!
I have no bunghole.
Bungholio. Bungholio!
This is the State dining room, where the most powerful world leaders are entertained.
Hey! Uh, where's the TV?
There are no TVs in the dining room.
This house sucks.
GUIDE: Please follow me.
Evacuation?
It's probably just another bomb threat or something.
OK.
Is this the lobby?
I am Cornholio!
I need TP for my bunghole!
Yes, Mr President.
BEAVIS: 'I am Cornholio!
'My bunghole, it goes rattatataa... '
- Mr President?
- (GIBBERISH)
Mr President,
I can't understand you.
Bwah! Bwah! Bwah! Ngaaah!
Sir, the President sounds strange.
I don't think it's a drill.
Washington may be under attack.
Go to DEFCON 4.
Step on it! Step on it! Move!
Uh huh huh huh...
Uh huh huh huh...
Uh huh huh...
Move it along, folks. Move it along.
Whoa! Hey, baby.
I noticed you have braces.
I have braces, too.
Whoa!
Uh huh huh huh. That was cool.
Whoa!
This is the coolest thing
I have ever seen.
- All right, where's the unit?
- Uhh...
My unit? Uh huh huh.
In my pants.
Uh... uh...
Not on him, Chief.
Agent Hurly, I want you to give this scumbag a cavity search.
I'm talking roto-rooter.
Don't stop till you reach the back of his teeth.
Yeah. Uh huh huh huh.
- Sir, we await your orders.
- Surrender your TP!
Give me that!
Mr President, in the name of all that's holy,
I need those launch codes.
I am Cornholio!
You will cooperate with my bunghole.
For there is but one bunghole.
The almighty bunghole.
He's clean, Chief.
Uh... huh huh huh...
Did I just score?
The other guy has it.
He's got to be here somewhere.
(FRENCH) "Cornholio?"
(HINDl) "Cornholio."
(GIBBERISH) Bung-ho!
Est-ce que vouz savez ce que c'est un "bung-hole?"
BEAVIS: Huh?
Fire. Bungholio.
Excuse me. I'm terribly sorry for the inconvenience, gentlemen, but we'll have to wait outside for a moment.
Follow me, please?
"TP for my bunghole?"
Yeah! Yeah! TP for my bunghole.
AIDE: Let these conference gentlemen through, please.
It's OK. He's with them.
You cannot run from your own bunghole.
Bunghole, bunghole, bunghole.
Aha.
Uh heh heh heh. Oh, yeah.
Ohh.
# Mucha muchacha
Ahh.
# Mucha muchacha
Oh-ho-ho.
Boi-yoi-yoi-yoi-yoi-ing!
# Mucha muchacha,
Mucha muchacha #
Boy, it really makes you proud.
I could stay in here all day.
Sir,
I have to ask you to leave. Now!
That's enough. I been plannin' this trip my whole life...
What do you think you're?
Something about a corn hole...
We haven't seen the Lincoln Room.
Let go of me!
Uh, say, Chief... isn't that the guy whose camper they were whackin'...
I mean, off in whose whackin' camper...
Not now, Bork.
Honey, this country's going to hell in a hand-basket.
I'm going to go and talk to my congressman about this.
BEAVIS: Aah! Ooh. Mmm. Ah!
What the hell?
Wait here a minute.
BEAVIS: Oh! No! Ohh, no!
What in the hell is that damn noise?
I... Huh? Aah! What?!
BEAVIS: Hey. How's it going?
Pull your damn pants up, boy!
I don't want to see that!
Get out of here!
If I ever catch you whackin' in here again,
I'll hog-tie you!
Aw, damn it!
Now I gotta straighten up in here.
We just cleared all four floors.
No sign of him.
Where the hell is he?
Say, Chief, isn't that the camper...
Bork, not now.
Chief, look.
Well, I'll be a monkey's bare-assed uncle.
Attention, all units. We've got him.
He's on Pennsylvania Avenue.
I am Cornholio!
I will lay waste to your bunghole!
Bungholio. Holio-bungholio.
Hit the deck! Get down!
Bunghole, bunghole, bunghole...
OK, nobody shoot.
He could still have the unit on him.
Keep your distance.
We don't want to risk hitting it.
- Where are his pants?
- Who knows?
Bunghole.
- Bunghole? Bungholio.
- This is Agent Flemming, ATF.
We won't hurt you.
We just want the unit.
Tell us where it is.
Do you have TP?
TP for my bunghole?
We'll get you whatever you want.
We might need that other kid.
Do you have any holio?
Uh, yeah, this is Bork.
Listen, we need some TP.
And some... what did he say?
Whoa. Uh huh huh huh.
This rules.
Can I have a gun, too?
You must bow down to the almighty bunghole!
This is cool.
Garga-holio-ala-hole...
This is your last chance.
Give us the unit now.
Why does everybody want to see my schlong?
Uh, bunghole.
- Mmm-bungholio-o-o-o-o.
- He's jerking us off.
We're gonna have to take him out.
Get ready to fire on my orders.
I am the one and only almighty one and only bungholio!
FLEMMING: This is your last chance.
I'll give you three seconds.
BEAVIS: I have no bungholio!
Fire on the count of three. One...
Would you like to see my bunghole?
- I will show you my bungho-o-o-ole!
- Two...
I have no bungho-o-le!
Uh huh huh huh.
What's going on?
- What is this?
- Three!
Take your damn pants with you!
- Hold your fire!
- What in hell?
The pants! He's got the unit!
Drop the pants. Now!
Wait a minute. I ain't the one... who...
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!
Uh huh. Uh huh huh.
Whoa. Oh.
Uh... here you go. Uh huh huh huh.
Wait just a minute, mister.
Sir, take a look at this.
How do you explain this?
What are you talking about?
So, using two innocent teenagers as pawns in your sick game, huh?
I already told you
I don't know what this is about.
- Take him away.
- Hey! Get your damn hands off me!
God damn it! Hey!
Aah! Ow!
Damn it!
You don't know who you're dealing with!
I'm a veteran of two foreign wars!
I ain't the one that...
I always thought there was something wrong with him.
Yeah. Uh huh huh huh.
- He had a lot of problems.
- Yeah, yeah.
And he used to hit me.
Yeah. Uh heh heh.
Uh, hey... does anyone wanna see MYunit?
I admit it. I figured you wrong.
I thought you were scum, but you saved more lives than you'll ever know.
You led us to one of the sickest criminals in history.
This country owes you a debt.
Uh, does that mean we're gonna get, like, money and stuff?
And, um, and chicks.
We were supposed to score.
For security reasons, your actions will have to remain top secret.
But someone very special wants to give his thanks.
Beavis and Butt-head, on behalf of your fellow Americans,
I extend my deepest thanks.
You exemplify a fine new crop of young Americans, who will grow into the leaders of this great country.
Uh huh huh huh. He said "extend".
Oh, yeah.
In recognition for your great service,
I'm appointing you honorary agents in the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco & Firearms.
Whoa!
Alcohol and tobacco?
Yeah.
- And firearms! Yeah.
- Cool, huh?
Cigarettes and beer kick ass.
Yeah! Yeah!
We're in the Bureau of beer and fire and cigarettes.
And maybe some chicks, too.
This is gonna be cool.
- Uh huh huh huh.
- Heh heh heh heh.
You know what sucks?
We never scored, or got any money.
Yeah. Really.
Um...
And my butt's still sore, and that chick with the braces...
Butt-head. Butt-head, look!
- Yes!
- Yes!
Yes! Yes!
- Ohh. Ohh, yes.
- Uh huh huh.
Oh, yeah.
Hey, Butt-head.
Do you think we're ever gonna score?
Uh, I probably will.
But not you. Uh huh huh huh.
You're too much of a butt-monkey.
- Shut up, dill-hole. Mm heh heh.
- Butt-dumpling. Uh huh huh.
- Turd burglar. Mm heh heh.
- Uh, ass goblin. Uh huh huh.
Shut up, Butt-head.
Um, hey, doesn't Tom Anderson live on this street?
- Uh, yeah.
- 'Cause, um...
I just need to stop by his tool shed for a minute.
Heh heh heh.
You know what I'm saying?
Tool. Uh huh huh huh.
Boi-yoi-yoi-yoi-yoi-ing!

and some of the surrounding gullies, so take out your...
Cody!
Yeah, Mom?
- What about your breakfast?
- I've got some sandwiches in my pack.
- Be home for supper.
- No worries, Mom.
I know, I'm coming.
Hustle up, Nelson.
Faloo's sounding the call!
Come on, little wombats, hurry!
Who's caught this time?
You don't know her, Cody.
Her name is Marahute, the great golden eagle.
Where is she?
She's caught, high on a cliff in a poacher's trap.
- You're the only one who can reach her.
- I'll get her loose.
Righto. Hop on, no time to lose.
She's up on top of that ridge.
Be careful, little friend.
Marahute!
Calm down, calm down.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
That's a girl. Stay still.
It's okay.
No, wait! I'm here to help you.
Easy! Easy!
You're free!
Higher!
Whoa!
Wow.
You're a mom!
They're very warm.
Are they gonna hatch soon?
Where's the daddy eagle?
Oh. My dad's gone, too.
Hey, little fella, what happened to you?
Oh, no! Get away!
- Don't worry. I'll get you loose.
- It's a trap. Careful!
Got one!
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I think so.
- Okey-dokey.
- Wait! Hey, come back!
Here you go, grab on.
That's great. Just a little more, a little further...
There! I got it.
Well, Joanna, what'd we get today?
A dingo, a fat ol' razorback, or a nice big...
Boy?
Joanna, you been diggin' holes out here again?
Dumb lizard always trying to bury squirrels out here.
Uh-uh. It's a trap, and poaching's against the law.
Trap? Where'd you get an idea like that?
I think you've been down in that hole for too long.
Come on, grab hold.
We'll get you out of this old lizard hole and you can just run along home.
This is a poacher's trap and you're a poacher.
Let go! Hey, get off of me.
McLEACH: I'm gonna kill her.
I'm gonna kill that dumb, slimy, egg-sucking salamander.
Cut it out! Get off of me.
Hmm.
Good girl, Joanna.
Say, where'd you get this pretty feather, boy?
It was a present.
That's real nice. Who gave it to you?
It's a secret.
That's no secret, boy.
You see, I already got the father.
You just tell me where Momma and those little eggs are.
No!
Joanna, sic him!
You're coming with me, boy.
My mom'll call the rangers!
Oh, no. Not the rangers.
What'll I do?
What'll I do? Don't let your mom call the rangers!
Please don't!
"My poor baby boy got eaten by the crocodiles!"
Boo hoo hoo.
Let's go, boy!
Help!
Help!
Help! Someone, help!
McLeach took a little boy.
Send for help!
Code red, code red! Attention all
Rescue Aid Society delegates.
All delegates report immediately to the main assembly hall.
This is an emergency meeting.
I repeat, this is a code red emergency meeting!
Order!
Yes, I know it's late, but I'm...
Really? Pajamas?
Hello, Frank, how are you?
Nice to see you!
And Esmerelda, there you are!
Quiet now, please, everyone pay attention.
There has been a kidnapping in Australia.
A young boy needs our help.
This is a mission requiring our very finest,
and I know we are all thinking of the same two mice.
What's this? Gone?
We must find Bernard and
Miss Bianca at once!
Oh, pea soup.
Pea soup!
To my dear Bernard, and our wonderful partnership.
Uh, yeah, wonderful.
You've been very quiet this evening.
Is there something on your mind?
Well, um, actually...
- I was wondering...
- Yes, darling?
I... Miss Bianca, would you...
Would you...
Would you excuse me for a minute?
Pardonnez-moi, Mademoiselle
Bianca, I have important news.
Yes, François? What is it?
You and Bernard have been asked to accept a dangerous mission to Australia.
The poor boy. This is dreadful.
Now where is Bernard?
I must tell him at once!
Allow me, madame,
I will tell him immediately.
Miss Bianca, will you marry me?
Quickly, Monsieur Bernard!
I must speak with you.
- Not now, François, I'm busy!
- No, monsieur, you don't...
- Bernard, did you talk to François?
- Yes, but there's something I want...
I know what you're going to say.
François told me about it.
He did? How did he...
It doesn't matter, I think it's a marvelous idea.
You do?
I mean, you really want to?
I don't think it's a matter of wanting, it's a matter of duty.
Duty? I never thought of it...
Well, all right. How does next April sound to you?
Heavens, no! We must act immediately, tonight!
Tonight? But wait!
Bianca, this is so sudden. I mean, don't you at least need a gown or something?
No, just a pair of khaki shorts and some hiking boots!
Hiking boots?
Oh, there you are.
Come along, come along.
Delegates, we have an important announcement.
Bernard and I have decided to accept the mission to Australia.
Australia?
Good show! Now, you must fly out immediately!
It's a little nippy outside, but we won't let that stop us, will we?
Miss Bianca, I'm not sure it's a good idea to fly this soon after eating!
Darling, you'll be just fine!
But aren't you supposed to wait 45 minutes?
Oh, just knock on the door and see if Orville is there!
Nobody's home, let's go.
This is no time to play in the snow.
I wasn't playing in the snow.
It was an avalanche.
Look, Bernard!
"Under new management, see Wilbur."
Come on, darling.
Let's get a move out!
I'm the cat's pajamas
Always run around with crazy little mamas
Whoo!
Yoo-hoo! Mr. Wilbur!
Get down there, son!
Hello?
Pick it, boy, pick it! Yeah!
Whoo! Here we go! Let's walk!
Whoo!
Look out! Excuse me, sir.
Do something! He can't hear us!
Big time, big time!
The girls all look when I go by...
Who killed the music?
That's better.
Excuse us for interrupting.
We're from the Rescue Aid Society.
I am Miss Bianca, and this is my...
The Miss Bianca? I don't believe it.
My brother, Orville, told me all about you. Boy. This is an honor to have...
May I just say, "Enchanté, señorita," to you? May I?
We need to charter a flight.
You've come to the right place, buddy boy. Welcome to...
"Albatross Air. A fair fare from here to there."
Get it? A fair fare?
It's a play on... Never mind.
I've got tons of exotic destinations, faraway places, custom designed for a romantic weekend getaway.
The finest in-flight accommodations.
Speaking of which, what can I get you?
How about a nice mango Maui cooler?
Very nice, very tasty.
No, thank you.
A coconut, guava nectar?
It's carbonated.
I got little umbrellas for each one, and a little coconut thing.
- It's urgent that we leave immediately!
- Nothing? Nothing at all?
- How about a cream soda?
- We need a flight to Australia.
Australia? The land down under?
That's a fabulous idea!
So when can I pencil you in?
After spring thaw?
Mid-June would be very nice.
We must leave tonight.
Tonight?
Come on, you're kidding me, right?
Have you looked outside?
It's suicide out there.
Oh, no. Oh, no.
I'm afraid your jolly little holiday will have to wait.
What a bunch of jokers.
But you don't understand, a boy needs our help. He's in trouble.
Boy? You mean, a little kid kinda boy?
He was kidnapped.
Kidnapped? Oh, that's awful.
Locking up a little kid.
A kid should be free.
Free to run wild through the house on Saturday mornings.
Free to have cookies and milk, and get those little white mustaches.
Nobody's gonna take a kid's freedom away while I'm around.
Does that mean you'll take us?
Storm or no storm,
Albatross Airlines, at your service!
Passengers are requested to fasten their seat belts and secure all carry-ons.
We'll be departing following our pre-flight maintenance. Thank you.
Loosen up, get the blood flowing up to the head.
And a couple of these...
Okay, one's enough, there we go.
Ah, yeah! That feels better. Oh, baby.
Tie your kangaroos down, sports fans!
Here we come!
Let's go for it! Whoa! Hey!
I didn't adjust for the winds.
All right, we're gonna make it!
Gotta duck down lower.
Go under the wind, go under it!
Here we go! Whoo-hoo!
Ow! This is cold!
Slippery! Ice!
We got ice!
Whoa! Hang on now!
Here we go!
Whoa! Cowabunga!
Captain, is this a non-stop flight to Australia?
Well, not exactly no.
I could definitely say no.
We're gonna have to make connections with a bigger bird.
Non-stop? What do I look like,
Charles Lindbergh?
Let me out of here! Let me go!
You can't do this!
Help!
Breaker, breaker, little mate.
I forgot to tell you around here, you need to be quiet!
Or the rangers might hear you.
Now sit down and relax, enjoy the view.
Nothing but abandoned opal mines as far as the eye can see.
And dead ahead, is home sweet home.
Home, home on the range
Where the critters are tied up in chains
I cut through their sides
And I rip off their hides
And the next day, I do it again
Everybody!
Home, home on the range...
Cody! Cody!
Cody!
Ladies and gentlemen, Flight 12 is now approaching Sydney airport.
Make sure your seat belts are fastened and tables secured.
Enjoy your stay in Australia.
- Are we there yet?
- Yes.
Perhaps we should wake up Wilbur.
All right, I'll get him up.
Wilbur.
Wilbur!
Just five more minutes, Ma.
- Wilbur!
- That's all I need, five more minutes.
Wilbur, are you awake?
- Get up, we're there!
- I'm up, I'm up.
Watch out!
Must have been sleeping on a bolt.
Oh, boy.
Throw another shrimp on the barbie, 'cause here I come!
- Here we go again!
- Cannonball!
Gangway! Coming through.
Mice on board!
Clear the way! Move over madam, there you go!
Coming through, sir. Thank you.
Next stop, Mugwomp Flats.
Did we lose anyone back there?
Miss Bianca, from now on, can't we just take the train?
Well, Sparky, you've had this coming for a long time.
And now, you're gonna get it.
Ha!
Wise fly.
Mugwomp tower,
this is Albatross 1-3 requesting permission to land. Over?
Albatross? Let's see.
Finch, wren, scrub-bird, lorikeet, freckled duck, galah,
Kookaburra, parrot, cockatoo, alba... It's a jumbo!
Negative, you'll have to turn back.
- Our runway isn't long enough for you.
- Not long enough?
Look pal, I can land this thing on a dime!
Wilbur, if the runway isn't long enough...
You can't let radar jockeys push you around. Leave it to me.
I say again, mate, our runway is too short.
And I say again, mate, I'm coming in!
Crazy Yank. Quick, Sparky, we gotta extend the runway.
Here we go!
We'll never make it!
Hot!
Passengers, please remain seated until the aircraft comes to a full and complete stop.
Thank you.
Whoa!
Quick, Sparky, we need to make a drag line!
Don't try and tell me the runway's too short.
Hold this for me, will you, pal?
Bloke ought to have his wings clipped.
Captain thanks you for flying Albatross Airlines...
Crazy Yanks.
They think they can do any fool thing without regard for...
Welcome to Australia, ma'am.
Name's Jake. If there's any way
I can make your stay pleasant, don't hesitate to ask.
- Oh, how kind.
- Allow me to get that bag for you.
I've got a lot of luggage here.
Let me give you a hand with those.
Part of the friendly service at Albatross...
Ow! Big time hurt!
Back! It's out!
- Are you all right?
- Don't worry, I'll handle this.
Sparky, watch the tower. We gotta get this bird to the hospital.
Can't go down, can't go up.
Take the bags!
- Heave! Ho!
- What are you doing?
What's going on? Wait!
- Wait a minute. Just stop everything.
- Wilbur, don't worry.
We'll come back the moment we find the boy.
Wait! Wait a minute!
Don't leave me here, please!
I'm feeling much better now.
I'm even ready to hit the beaches.
I'm even ready to mambo.
Doctor, will he be all right?
Now, my dear. Keep a stiff upper lip.
They all come in with a whimper, and leave with a grin.
Off with you now. Leave everything to me. Shoo, shoo. Off you go.
Hop to it, ladies. We've got a bent bird on our hands.
- Move, bustle, bustle. That's it.
- Will it hurt, Doc?
Dear boy, you won't feel a thing.
- Launch the back brace!
- Hey, wait!
I've been skewered!
I've already missed tea, Mr. Albatross.
Now don't force me to take drastic measures. You must relax.
Relax? I have never been more relaxed in my life!
If I were any more relaxed, I'd be dead!
I'm not convinced.
60 milligrams!
60 milligrams.
Hey! What?
Are you guys crazy?
You can't do that to me!
I'm an American citizen, buddy!
- Better double it!
- Double?
- Double, coming up!
- No!
Prepare the albatross for medication.
I'm dreaming! Come on,
Wilbur. Wake up, boy!
- Three degrees right.
- Come on!
- Three degrees right.
- Down two degrees.
Don't go down two!
- Down two degrees.
- Ready!
No, I'm not ready! No, please!
Aim!
Please don't do this to me.
Fire!
Now we just gotta figure out how to get there.
So are you and your husband here on a little outback excursion?
No, we're not married.
In fact, we're here on a top secret mission.
Very hush-hush.
Gonna rescue that kid McLeach nabbed?
Why, that's right! How did you know?
You'll find it's tough to keep secrets in the outback, miss.
So which way you taking?
Suicide Trail through Nightmare
Canyon, or shortcut at Satan's Ridge?
- "Suicide Trail"?
- Good choice.
More snakes, less quicksand.
Then once you cross Bloodworm Creek, you're scot-free, that is until...
Dead Dingo Pass.
Wait a minute, I don't see any of that stuff on the map.
A map's no good in the outback!
What you really need is someone who knows the territory.
Mr. Jake, will you guide us?
At your service!
Better take my arm, miss.
It's gonna be a treacherous hike.
I remember the time it was just me and 400 of these big, giant...
Doesn't even know how to fold a map.
This is how we get around in the outback, Miss B.
The only way to travel, Berno.
Yeah, it's just a little bumpy back here.
Cinch up your seat belts, mates.
We're coming in for a landing.
Hold it, not yet!
Well, boy, let's see if we can do something to refresh that rusty, old memory of yours.
Is she on Satan's Ridge?
Or Nightmare Canyon?
What do you think?
Yeah, that's it.
Right smack dab in the middle at Croc Falls!
- Am I getting warm?
- I told you, I don't remember.
Don't you realize a bird that size is worth a fortune?
I'll split the money 50/50.
You can't get a better offer than that.
You won't have any money after the rangers get through with you.
Jake's been gone... Ow!
Been gone a long time.
Maybe I should go... Oh!
Maybe I should go look for him.
Don't you worry about Jake.
He can handle himself.
Yeah, I noticed.
I am just sure he'll be back in no time.
You know, now that we're alone, there's...
There's something that I've been wanting to ask you.
Yes? What is it?
Well, it's like this.
Miss Bianca, I would be most honored if...
Look out!
No mice for you, Twister, not today!
There!
Miss Bianca!
I've been looking all over for you.
Now look.
We got a long way to go, and you're gonna take us there.
You're not gonna give us any trouble about it.
Right?
They're harmless once you look them in the eye, let them know who's boss.
Ain't that right, mate? Now get.
It's all right, Bernard.
Jake has everything under control.
Yeah, I noticed.
You know, Miss Bianca, truth be told,
I used to be quite a dingo wrestler.
There was this one time, it was just me and 300 of these ferocious, mouse-eating dingoes.
Had me surrounded...
I'll give you a night down here to think it over.
But tomorrow, no more Mr. Nice Guy.
Joanna! You thick-headed chunk of fish-bait!
I'll never tell you where she is!
Never! Never!
Yeah, we'll never tell!
You'll have to drag it out of us!
Hey, where did you come from?
The desert?
Well, fancy that!
Looks like McLeach has begun trapping his own kind!
There's no hope for any of us now.
No hope? No hope!
- No!
- But there must be a way out of here.
There's a way out, all right.
There is?
Absolutely.
You'll go as a wallet, you'll go as a belt, and our dear Frank...
- I don't want to hear it.
- Frank will go as...
I can't hear you!
- A purse.
- No!
A lovely ladies' purse.
I don't want to go as a purse.
Please, don't let him do it!
- Don't worry, we'll get out of here.
- We are?
Yeah. If we all put our heads together,
I'm sure we'll think of something.
Yeah, something.
Frank, what's wrong?
Oh, here he goes again.
Take it easy. You don't want to hurt yourself again.
Ooh. I got it!
All we gotta do is get the keys!
Oh. Is that all? Well then, we better start packing our bags.
No, wait. He's right.
If we could get these long pieces of wood...
Yeah, wood, good.
Maybe we could...
That's right, just a little more. There!
Come on, everybody.
Get some more stuff!
The kid's right.
What are we waiting for?
That's it, you've got it!
Hurry. We need something to tie it together.
Hey, what do you got?
Shoelaces!
Almost.
- A little further.
- Yeah, yeah.
- it's okay. Let's try again.
- Yeah, yeah.
Easy. Easy does it.
Yeah, no, no! Yeah, yeah.
Will somebody shut him up?
- We did it!
- You've got it!
I've got it! I'll just take my tail, and I'll pick the lock, like this!
Frank, give it a rest.
You'll thank me when you're free.
Look, I just insert my tail, like this, and I turn it like this, just a quarter turn to the left, and then push it a little bit further.
Show him who's boss, Berno!
I feel like I got my head in a vice.
Oh!
- Are we ready, nurse?
- Ready, Doctor.
All right, ladies, snap to it!
Ooh, that smarts!
Ah, let me see here.
- Forceps!
- Forceps.
Oh, no, what now?
- Spinal stretch-u-lator.
- That's gonna hurt.
Artery router.
Mother!
This is rusted tight. I wouldn't dream of using such a tool.
Bring me the epidermal tissue disrupter!
The epidermal what?
Oh, no! No!
Mr. Albatross, we haven't operated yet!
- You gotta catch me first, Doc.
- Mr. Albatross, please!
Cowabunga!
Mr. Albatross, we must return you to the operating room!
You'll never take me alive!
Please don't do this!
Your spine needs tender... loving... care!
Oh! Oh!
My back!
Hey! Hey!
I can... It works! I'm cured!
My back!
Don't worry!
I'm coming, you little mice.
This is the finest fleet on two webbed feet.
Oh, boy, I gotta go on a diet when I get home.
Here we go!
In other news, authorities in Mugwomp Flats
called off the search for the missing boy.
His backpack was found near
Crocodile Falls, and rangers believe
he was yet another victim of crocodile attack.
Authorities once again warn residents to use extreme caution...
Think you're pretty smart, don't you?
Who outsmarted who?
Who? Who outsmarted who?
I still gotta get that boy to talking.
I'm hungry. Can't think on an empty stomach.
Gotta have protein. Gotta have eggs.
Everyone's got his price.
All I gotta do is offer him whatever he wants, and then not give it to him.
Did you take one of my eggs?
Open your mouth.
These are not Joanna eggs.
Let's see. The boy's got the eagle.
I want the eagle.
The boy won't give me the eagle.
If I could just find the boy's weak spot,
I could get him to tell me where the eagle is.
But the boy's only got one weak spot, and that is the eagle.
Maybe if I stuck him in a giant anthill, that would loosen his tongue and then...
I got it!
Got your hand caught in the cookie jar.
Who you think you're messing with, you dumb animal?
My mental facilities are twice what yours are, you pea brain.
Joanna, I give you platypus eggs,
I give you snake eggs, why, I'll even give you eagle eggs, but I want you to stay away from my...
The eagle's eggs!
That's it!
That's the boy's weak spot!
Push it in a little bit farther, take it back a little bit...
I give up!
I'll never get this. We're doomed!
Doomed!
Hey, look! Krebbs, Frank's out!
Frank, you're free!
Free?
I'm free! I'm free! I'm free!
Shh! Joanna'll hear!
Double or nothing, he's caught in five minutes.
- Calm down, little mate.
- Didn't I tell you?
Look at me, I'm free!
Frank, get the keys.
I should get the keys.
I'm stuck!
Shh! Quiet!
Quiet, you fool!
Take it easy, I'll get you loose.
There you go.
Now go get the keys.
The keys. Yeah, yeah.
Keys, keys, keys.
I can't reach them.
Quick, get something to stand on.
Stand on, something to stand on.
This ought to be rich.
Stand on...
Frank.
Use the box! Climb up on the box!
Of course, a box!
- Quiet!
- These darn things are heavy!
Whoops.
The keys, give us the keys!
Over here! Give us the keys!
Yee-haw! Ride him, Frank!
Yah-hoo! Howdy, howdy!
Howdy, howdy, howdy!
Let me in! Let me in! Let me in!
No! No! No!
No! No! No! No!
Huh. Missed.
McLEACH: Surprise!
If I didn't know better,
I'd think you didn't like it here.
Let me go, let go! Let go!
What are you doing out of your cage?
Hmm. That's better.
Come on, boy.
Say goodbye to your little friends.
It's the last you'll ever see of them.
There is no time to waste.
- We must try to get in.
- Here, Miss Bianca, start digging.
Has anyone considered trying, "Open sesame"?
Hey, it worked!
McLEACH: Get out of here! Go on! Get!
Look, Bernard, it's the boy!
And McLeach.
It's all over, boy.
Your bird's dead. Someone shot her.
Shot her, right outta the sky.
No!
What do you mean, no?
You callin' me a liar?
I heard it on the radio.
And she could have been mine if it weren't for you.
Now you better get, before I change my mind.
Go on, get!
- Why is he letting him go?
- It's gotta be a trick.
Too bad about those eggs, eh, Joanna.
They'll never survive without their mother.
Oh, well. Survival of the fittest, I guess.
Bingo!
- Bird?
- Eggs?
Shh. Listen.
I didn't make it all the way through third grade for nothing.
Don't know where he's going, but we can't let him get away.
- Hurry up, you two!
- Quickly, Bernard, now!
Oh, no!
Get between the treads!
Bernard, Bianca, here, catch!
Got it! Miss Bianca, you can do it!
Boy, this is some head wind.
Say, you lovely ladies wouldn't have seen two little mice running around down there, would you?
Hey, where you going?
I mean it, I'm looking for two little mice!
Is it something I said?
He's going down the cliff.
Come on, we gotta warn him.
- Cody.
- Huh?
- Who are you?
- There is no time to explain.
You're in great danger.
Marahute? It can't be!
Cody, wait!
She's alive!
Cody, please! You must listen!
That's right,
McLeach is on the cliff.
Marahute, no! Turn back! Turn back!
Stay away! It's a trap!
I got her! I got her!
Did you see that?
Perfect shot! Perfect shot!
She's mine!
All mine!
No!
Hold tight you two.
We're going for a ride!
- Bianca!
- Bernard!
Meddlin' brat.
Gonna get rid of him for good.
Help, I'm slipping!
Cody, don't move!
There she is, Joanna.
Just look at her.
Look at the size of her.
The rarest bird in the world.
That bird's gonna make me rich.
Filthy rich.
I got what I want.
Now, what does Joanna want?
Does she wanna make sure that bird stays rare?
How about some great, big, triple-A, jumbo eagle eggs?
Huh? You want them?
Huh? You want them? Go get them!
No! Please!
Why, whatever is the matter?
Get moving!
Joanna!
You hurry up and eat those eggs and get your tail up here!
Move it!
Okay, you guys, she fell for it.
Looks like the coast is clear.
Girls? Girls, I'm here!
Where are you, you little chickees, you?
Wilbur?
Wilbur!
Don't ever do that to me again!
Boy, I lost a lot of feathers on that one.
Wilbur, am I glad to see you!
- Help me with these eggs, will you?
- Sure.
Wait a minute, what the heck are you doing up here?
The kidnapper took the boy and Jake. Miss Bianca.
Miss Bianca's in trouble? Whoa!
That's terrible! We gotta do something!
Bernard, I'm disappointed in you.
Hiding under a nest while Bianca needs help.
- I gotta talk to you, mister.
- Wilbur.
You should start searching the desert for her, and I'll scan the coastline!
That's what I'll do.
Ask the chicks on the beach.
What?
Listen! There's some chicks here that need help.
Really?
Oh, no. Wait a minute. Hold it.
I know what you're thinking, and you're wrong. Don't even, no.
Don't look at me!
You're getting "no." Understand?
I will not ever sit on those eggs!
Aw, nuts!
Gotta learn to be more assertive.
No is no is no.
Hey, quit moving in there!
Well, Joanna, it looks like Lady Luck has finally decided to smile on us.
Everything's going our way.
You can't do this!
You're gonna get in big trouble!
I'll tell the rangers where you are!
I almost forgot.
We got a loose end to tie up, haven't we, girl?
Now, now, Cody, we mustn't lose hope.
- Bernard is still out there.
- That's right!
If anyone can get us out of this scrape, it's old Berno!
- Nice bluff, Miss B.
- I wasn't bluffing.
You don't know Bernard like I do.
He'll never give up.
Oh, my gosh!
Uh... Excuse me.
Look, I've got a long way to go, you're going to take me there, and you're not going to give me any trouble, right?
Good.
Now, get!
Are you ready, boy?
It's time you learned how to fish for crocs!
They like it when you use live bait.
And you're as live as they come.
Oh!
You get a line
And I'll get a pole, matey
You get a line
I'll get a pole, friend
Oh, you get a line, I'll get a pole
We'll go fishing in the crocodile hole
Buddy, pal of mine
That's right, babies. Suppertime!
It don't look good, Miss B. I can't see any way out of this one.
Bernard, please hurry!
Now, this is my idea of fun.
Nothing personal, boy, but I wouldn't want to disappoint the rangers.
They was looking so hard for you, and now they're gonna find you!
What the blaze is going on here?
Joanna.
Did you know there was a razorback in my truck? Did ya?
There was a razorback in my truck!
Now you quit playing around and do your job, you four-legged python!
Hey, what happened to them keys?
Must be around here somewhere.
They couldn't just get up and walk away.
Something weird's going on around here. I smell a big, fat rat.
- Look, it's Bernard!
- I don't believe it!
- Way to go, mate!
- Miss Bianca, Jake, catch!
Well, there's more than one way to skin a cat.
Blast!
Oh, my gosh! I hope I know what I'm doing.
Hey, get off me!
Whoa! Whoa!
Joanna! Joanna!
You stupid lizard! Get off me!
You idiot!
Get off of me!
No! No!
Bernard, the boy!
Help!
Help!
Get back!
Get away. Get away!
I whooped you! I whooped you all!
You'll think twice before messing with Percival C. McLeach!
No!
Don't give up, Cody!
There!
Hop on, Miss B!
Help! Help!
It's okay.
Come on.
Thanks, little mate.
Oh, Bernard, you are magnificent.
You are absolutely the hero of the day.
Miss Bianca, before anything else happens,
- will you marry me?
- Bernard.
Of course, I will!
Well done, mate.
Come on, Marahute, let's all go home.
Help!
Anybody!
Bernard!
Bianca!
Where are you?
Okay, that's it, I'm out of here.
This is ridiculous.
You can't leave me here alone.
I'm gone! I am gone.
No, stay in those eggs!
That's a direct order!
Oh.
Hey, you're kind of a cute little feller. Coochy, coochy...
In Sixteen Hundred Seven
We sailed the open sea
For glory, God and gold
And the Virginia Company
For the New World is like heaven
And we'll all be rich and free
Or so we have been told
By the Virginia Company
So we have been told
By the Virginia Company
For glory, God, and gold
And the Virginia Company
- Ready to hoist the cannon?
- Aye!
Hey, look. Is that Smith?
That's him, all right.
The old sea dog.
Captain John Smith?
I've heard amazing stories about him.
Are you coming on this voyage, too?
Course he is, you half-wit! You can't fight Indians without John Smith!
That's right. I'm not about to let you boys have all the fun.
On the beaches of Virginny
There's diamonds like debris
There's silver rivers flowin'
Gold you pick right off a tree
With a nugget for my Winnie
And another one for me
And all the rest'll go
To the Virginia Company
It's glory, God, and gold
And the Virginia Company
Full anchor release!
Come on, lads! Come on!
Give me a hand, someone!
Watch out!
Faster! She's taking on more water!
Look out!
John! Get down here!
The cannons are breaking loose!
- Reef the topsails!
- Aye, sir!
Steady on your course!
It's all right, Thomas!
We'll get her tied off.
Say your prayers, lads!
Look out!
Thomas, watch out...!
Help!
Man overboard!
Help!
Stay your course! He's lost!
Help!
- Pull the pin.
- Aye, sir!
Smith!
Are you crazy?
Hang on, Thomas. I've got you!
Quick... the rope!
Heave!
Come on, lads! Pull!
Pull! Pull!
Put your back into it!
Pull! Pull!
Hang on!
Ah, my lucky lad!
Well, that was refreshing.
- Well done, Smith.
- Of course...
...you'd all do the same for me.
- Yes, yes.
- Sure, sure.
- Of course we would!Absolutely!
- Yeah, we would.
Trouble on deck?
- Governor Ratcliffe!
- Thomas fell overboard, sir.
Thank heavens he's been successfully retrieved.
- Well done, Smith.
- Thank you, sir.
Don't lose heart, men. It won't be long before we reach the New World, and remember what awaits us there...
Freedom, prosperity, the adventure of our lives.
You're the finest crew
England has to offer, and nothing, not wind nor rain, nor a thousand bloodthirsty savages shall stand in our way.
Carry on, men!
A stirring oration, sir.
I'm sure the men were most exhilarated!
Let us hope so. I'll need those witless peasants to dig up my gold, won't I?
This New World's going to be great, John.
I'm going to get a pile of gold, build me a big house, and if any
Indian tries to stop me, I'll blast him.
Just worry about that fortune of yours, Thomas.
- Leave the savages to me.
- You think they'll give us trouble?
Not as much trouble as Smith'll give them.
We'll kill ourselves an injun
Or maybe two or three
We're stalwart men and bold ofthe Virginia Company
What do you suppose the New World will look like?
Like all the others, I suppose.
I've seen hundreds of New Worlds, Thomas.
What could possibly be different about this one?
It's glory
God, and gold
And the Virginia Company
Steady as the beating drum
Singing to the cedar flute
Seasons go and seasons come
Bring the corn and bear the fruit
By the waters sweet and clean
Where the mighty sturgeon lives
Plant the squash and reap the bean
All the earth our Mother gives
O, Great Spirit, hear our song
Help us keep the ancient ways
Keep the sacred fires strong
Walk in balance all our days
Seasons go and seasons come
Steady as the beating drum
Plum to seed to bud to plum
Steady as the beating drum
It's good to be home.
The Massawomecks are defeated!
With the help of our brothers, our villages are safe again.
Your return has brought much joy to the village.
Look at all the smiling faces.
Yes. But there's one smiling face I don't see.
Where is my daughter?
You know Pocahontas.
She has her mother's spirit.
She goes wherever the wind takes her.
Pocahontas!
Your father's back.
Come down here!
He's back, Flit.
Come on, Meeko!
No! Not that... way.
Show-off.
Pocahontas?
Pocahontas? Are you all right?
You'd better be all right, because I'm not coming in after you...
Don't you think we're getting a little old for these games?
Help me turn this thing over.
What were you doing up there?
Thinking. Meeko!
About the dream again?
Have you figured it out yet?
I know it means something,
I just don't know what.
- You should ask your father about it.
- Maybe I should.
Come on, Flit.
Quit playing around.
We have to get back.
...faced a determined enemy.
The battle lasted from the rising of the sun until the evening shadows fell.
Our warriors fought with courage, but none as bravely as Kocoum, for he attacked with the fierce strength of the bear.
- He has proven himself to be...
- He is so handsome!
I especially love the smile.
...destroying every enemy in his path.
Tonight, we will feast in his honour.
- My daughter.
- Winggapo, Father.
Seeing you gives me greatjoy.
I'm so glad you've come home safely.
Come with me.
We have much to talk about.
I want to hear everything you've been doing.
Father, for many nights now,
I've been having a very strange dream.
It's telling me something's about to happen, something exciting.
Yes. Something exciting is about to happen.
Really? What is it?
Kocoum has asked to seek your hand in marriage.
Marry Kocoum?
I told him it would make my heart soar.
But he's so... serious.
My daughter,
Kocoum will make a fine husband.
He is loyal and strong and will build you a good house with sturdy walls.
With him, you will be safe from harm.
Father, I think my dream is pointing me down another path.
This is the right path for you.
But why can't I choose...
Pocahontas, come with me.
You are the daughter of the chief.
It is time to take your place among our people.
Even the wild mountain stream must someday join the big river.
As the river cuts his path
Though the river's proud and strong
He will choose the smoothest course
That's why rivers live so long.
They're steady
As the steady beating drum
Your mother wore this for our wedding.
It was her dream to see you wear it at your own.
It suits you.
He wants me to be steady.
Like the river.
But it's not steady at all.
What I love most about rivers is
You can't step in the same river twice
The water's always changing
Always flowing
But people, I guess can't live like that
We all must pay a price
To be safe we lose our chance of ever knowing
What's around the river bend
Waiting just around the river bend
I look once more
Just around the river bend
Beyond the shore
Where the gulls fly free
Don't know what for
What I dream the day might send
Just around the river bend
For me
Coming for me
I feel it there beyond those trees
Or right behind these waterfalls
Can I ignore that sound of distant drumming?
For a handsome, sturdy husband who builds handsome, sturdy walls
And never dreams that something might be coming
Just around the river bend
I look once more
Just around the river bend
Beyond the shore
Somewhere past the sea
Don't know what for
Why do all my dreams extend
Just around the river bend?
Just around the river bend
Should I choose the smoothest course
Steady as the beating drum?
Should I marry Kocoum?
Is all my dreaming at an end?
Or do you still
Wait for me, dream giver?
Just around the river
Bend
Is that my Pocahontas?
Grandmother Willow,
I need to talk to you.
Good morning, child.
I was hoping you'd visit today.
Why, your mother's necklace!
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
My father wants me to marry Kocoum.
Kocoum? But he's so serious!
I know. My father thinks it's the right path for me.
But lately, I've been having this dream, and I think it's...
Oh, a dream! Let's hear all about it!
Quiet!
Now, child, you were saying?
Well, I'm running through the woods, and then right there in front of me is an arrow.
As I look at it, it starts to spin.
A spinning arrow? How unusual!
Yes, it spins faster and faster and faster... until, suddenly, it stops.
Well, it seems to me this spinning arrow is pointing you down your path.
But, Grandmother Willow, what is my path?
How am I ever going to find it?
Your mother asked me the very same question.
She did? What did you tell her?
I told her to listen.
All around you are spirits, child.
They live in the earth, the water, the sky.
If you listen, they will guide you.
- I hear the wind.
- Yes.
What is it telling you?
I don't understand.
You will understand
Listen with your heart
You will understand
Let it break upon you like a wave upon the sand
It's saying something's coming.
Strange clouds?
Listen with your heart
You will understand
What do you see?
Clouds. Strange clouds.
Look at it, Wiggins, an entire
New World chock-full of gold, just waiting for me.
And scores of adventures waiting for us, right, Percy?
Do you think we'll meet some savages?
Ifwe do, we shall be sure to give them a proper English greeting.
Gift baskets!
And he came so highly recommended.
It's perfect, the water's deep enough.
We can pull right up to shore.
Hey, there, Percy.
- Very well, then. Give the order.
- Already done, sir.
I've got a crew assembled, and they're ready to go.
About the natives...
I'm counting on you to make sure those filthy heathens don't disrupt our mission.
Well, if they're anything like the savages I've fought before, it's nothing I can't handle.
Right. That'll be all, Smith.
There's a good man.
See ya, Percy.
The men like Smith, don't they?
- I've never been a popular man.
- I like you.
Don't think I don't know what those backstabbers at court say about me.
Oh, yes, all that talk about being a pathetic social climber
- who's failed at everything...
- I'm very well aware that this is my last chance for glory.
But mark my words, Wiggins, when King James sees the gold these peasants unearth, success will be mine, at last.
- Wake up! Shake a leg!
- Two of you up on the yardarm!
It's incredible.
And it's all ours.
I've never seen anything like it.
It can look like
Ratcliffe's knickers for all I care, just as long as I get off this stinking boat!
Come on, men. We didn't come all this way just to look at it.
Keep it taut, lads.
Keep it taut! Steady! Steady!
Hold up! That's far enough!
All right now... tie her off!
Here, John, tie off this end.
John? John?
- What are you doing up there?
- Getting a better look.
Hey!
Well... you're a strange looking fellow.
You hungry?
Here you go. It's a biscuit.
It's food. Well, sort of.
You like it, eh?
Well, try eating it for four months straight.
You got a friend back there?
Hey... what the... What...? Watch out.
- No... get that... Look out!
- John, you better get down here!
- The governor's coming ashore.
- All right. I'm leaving.
Did you see their skin?
Pale and sickly.
They have hair on their faces like dogs.
My brothers, we must know more about these visitors.
Kekata, what do you see?
These are not men like us...
...but strange beasts with bodies that shine like the sun, and weapons that spout fire and thunder.
They prowl the earth like ravenous wolves, consuming everything in their path.
Great Powhatan, I will lead our warriors to the river and attack.
We will destroy these invaders the way we destroyed the Massawomecks.
Kocoum, in that battle we knew how to fight our enemy, but these pale visitors are strange to us.
Take some men to the river to observe them.
Let us hope they do not intend to stay.
I hereby claim this land and all its riches in the name of His Majesty,
King James the First, and do so name this settlement Jamestown.
Bravo! Bravo!
Beautifully spoken, sir!
Hurry now, Percy.
We must be all squeaky clean for the New World.
Captain Smith, it appears
I've selected the perfect location.
Not a savage in sight.
Just because we don't see them doesn't mean they're not out there.
Then perhaps you should venture forth and determine their whereabouts.
If there are any Indians out there, I'll find them.
Now, gentlemen, to work.
You men, get the ship unloaded, you men build the fort.
The rest of you... break out the shovels!
- It's time to start digging!
- Digging?
Well, of course! Let's not forget what the Spanish found when they came to the New World.
Gold! Mountains of it.
Why, for years, they've been ravaging the New World of its most precious resources.
But now...
...it's our turn.
The gold of Cortéz the jewels of Pizarro
Will seem like mere trinkets by this time tomorrow
The gold we find here will dwarfthem by far
Oh, with all you got in ya, boys
Dig up Virginia, boys
Mine, boys
Mine every mountain
And dig, boys
Dig till ya drop
Grab a pick, boys
Quick, boys
Shove in a shovel
Uncover those lovely pebbles that sparkle and shine
It's gold
And it's mine, mine, mine
Dig and diggety dig
And dig and dig and diggety dig
- Hey, nonny, nonny hi, nonny, nonny
- Ooh, how I love it
- Hey, nonny, nonny, hi, nonny, nonny
- Riches for cheap
- Hey, nonny, nonny, hi, nonny, nonny
- There'll be heaps of it
- And I'll be on top of the heap
- Diggety, diggety, diggety, dig!
My rivals back home it's not that I'm bitter
But think how they'll squirm when they see how I glitter
The ladies at court will be all a-twitter
The king will reward me
He'll knight me
No! Lord me
It's mine!
Mine, mine for the taking
It's mine, boys
Mine me that gold
With those nuggets dug it's glory they'll give me
My dear friend, King Jimmy will probably build me a shrine
When all ofthe gold
Is mine
And dig and dig and diggety dig
All of my life I have searched for a land like this one
A wild or more challenging country
I couldn't design
Hundreds of dangers await and I don't plan to miss one
In a land I can claim, a land I can tame
- The greatest adventure is mine
- Keep on working, lads
- Mine
- Don't be shirking, lads
Mine, boys, mine
Mine me that gold
- Beautiful gold
- Dig for that gold
Make this island my land
Make the mounds big, boys
I'd help you to dig, boys
But I've got this crick in me spine
- This land we behold
- This beauty untold
- A man can be bold
- It all can be sold
So go for the gold
We know which is here
Mine, mine, mine
No! Wait! Please...
Please!
Don't run off.
It's all right.
I'm not going to hurt you.
Here. Let me help you out of there.
You don't understand a word
I'm saying, do you?
It's all right.
Listen with your heart
You will understand
Let it break upon you
Like a wave upon the sand
Who are you?
Listen with your heart
You will understand
Pocahontas.
What? What did you say?
My name is Pocahontas.
I'm John Smith.
That's it. Keep at it, men.
Keep digging.
It's got to be here somewhere.
- There's 30 more down by the ridge.
- That makes more than 100!
- Anything yet?
- Nothing but rocks and dirt, sir.
How long are we going to keep digging like this, sir?
We're slaving away, busting our backs day and night...
For king and country. I know, I know.
And I share your fatigue. Wiggins!
Wiggins!
- Coming!
- Dispose of this.
Who's a good doggie?
Fetch, boy!
Savages! It's an ambush!Arm yourselves!
Run!
Arm yourselves!
Make sure every man has a musket!
Shoot!
Them, you idiot!
Where's that blasted Smith when I need him?
Namontack!
Back to the village!
Shut up. Shut up, you fools!
They'll be back.
Everyone back to camp.
Get the rest of the cannons ashore, finish building the fort!
Aye, Governor!
And you... learn to use that thing properly.
A man's not a man unless he knows how to shoot.
These beasts invade our shores, and now this.
This wound is strange to me.
We will fight this enemy, but we cannot do it alone.
Kocoum, send messengers to every village in our nation.
We will call on our brothers to help us fight.
These white men are dangerous!
No one is to go near them.
It's called a helmet.
Helmet.
So... what river is this?
Quiyoughcohannock.
You have the most unusual names here.
Chickahominy.
Quiyo... Quiyoughcohannock.
Pocahontas.
You have the most unusual name, too.
John Smith.
Hey! Is this bottomless pit a friend of yours?
- Meeko!
- Well, how do you do, Meeko?
It's all right. It's just a handshake.
Here, let me show you.
Nothing's happening.
No, no. I need your hand first.
It's how we say hello.
This is how we say hello. Winggapo.
Winggapo.
And how we say goodbye. Anah.
I like hello better.
Yeah, I remember you.
- Flitjust doesn't like strangers.
- But I'm not a stranger any more.
Stubborn little fellow, isn't he?
- Very stubborn.
- Hey!
- Meeko! Come back here.
- Don't worry. He can't hurt it.
- Hey! What are you doing?
- Meeko, bring that back.
No, it's all right. He can keep it.
Call it a gift.
What was that?
- My compass.
- Compass?
It tells you how to find your way when you get lost.
It's all right.
I'll get another in London.
London? Is that your village?
- Yes. It's a very big village.
- What's it like?
It's got streets filled with carriages, bridges over the rivers, and buildings as tall as trees.
- I'd like to see those things.
- You will.
- How?
- We're going to build them here.
We'll show your people how to use this land properly.
- How to make the most of it.
- Make the most of it?
Yes. We'll build roads and decent houses...
Our houses are fine.
You think that only because you don't know any better.
Wait a minute. Don't take it that...
Hey! Wait!
Wait! There's so much we can teach you.
We've improved the lives of savages all over the world.
Savages?
Not that you're a savage.
- Just my people.
- No.
Listen, that's not what I meant.
Let me explain.
- Let go!
- No. I'm not letting you leave.
Look, don't do this.
Savage is just a word, you know?
A term for... people who are uncivilised.
Like me.
Well, when I say uncivilised, what I mean is...
What you mean is... not like you.
You think I'm an ignorant savage
And you've been so many places
I guess it must be so
But still, I cannot see
Ifthe savage one is me
How can there be so much that you don't know
You don't know
You think you own whatever land you land on
The earth isjust a dead thing you can claim
But I know every rock and tree and creature
Has a life, has a spirit, has a name
You think the only people who are people
Are the people who look and think like you
But if you walk the footsteps of a stranger
You'll learn things you never knew you never knew
Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon?
Or ask the grinning bobcat why he grinned?
Can you sing with all the voices ofthe mountain?
Can you paint with all the colours ofthe wind?
Can you paint with all the colours
Ofthe wind?
Come run the hidden pine trails ofthe forest
Come taste the sun-sweet berries ofthe earth
Come roll in all the riches all around you
And for once, never wonder what they're worth
The rainstorm and the river are my brothers
The heron and the otter are my friends
And we are all connected to each other
In a circle, in a hoop, that never ends
How high does the sycamore grow?
If you cut it down then you'll never know
And you'll never hear the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
For whether we are white or copper-skinned
We need to sing with all the voices ofthe mountain
We need to paint with all the colours ofthe wind
You can own the earth, and still
All you'll own is earth until
You can paint
With all the colours
Ofthe
Wind
What is it?
The drums. They mean trouble.
I shouldn't be here.
- I want to see you again.
- I can't.
- Please, don't leave.
- I'm sorry.
I have to go.
All right! This one's ready to hoist!
Two on each side. Ready now? Push!
Watch it! It's slipping.
Come on, lads, it's only a little picket fence.
- Steady! Steady!
- There you go.
That'll keep everything out, eh, John?
- Something wrong, John?
- What?
- You've been quiet the last few days.
- He's mad he missed all the action.
Don't worry, John. You'll get your chance to deal with the Indians.
Yeah. We'll take care of them, like we did last time, eh, mates?
We shot ourselves an injun
Or maybe two or three
All right, you howling nutter, get to work.
Come on, Ben. It's just a little fun.
Sure! We're having loads of fun, right?
Look at us. No gold, no food, while Ratcliffe sits up in his tent all day, happy as a clam.
I'm doomed!
I should be wallowing in riches by now, and I haven't found as much as a speck.
Think. Think!
It's got to be around here somewhere.
Where could it be?
I've mined the forests and the hills and the swamps... and nothing!
Why can't I find it?
What am I overlooking?
I... I...
I made it myself!
Take that silly...
Of course. The Indians.
Wiggins, why do you think those insolent heathens attacked us?
We invaded their land, cut down their trees and dug up their earth?
It's the gold! They have it, and they don't want us to take it from them.
Well, I'll just have to take it by force then, won't I?
You there! Where's Captain Smith?
- Well, he's... gone.
- Aye. Your singing scared him off.
- Go get him, for heaven's sake!
- What ifwe run into the Indians?
That's what guns are for.
Now arm yourselves and get moving!
Pocahontas.
You should be inside the village.
We'll be all right.
We're gathering food for when the warriors arrive.
Don't go far.
- Now is not the time to be running off.
- Yes, Father.
When I see you wear that necklace, you lookjust like your mother.
I miss her.
But she is still with us.
Whenever the wind moves through the trees, I feel her presence.
Our people look to her for wisdom and strength.
Someday, they will look to you as well.
I would be honoured by that.
You shouldn't be out here alone.
- I'll send for Kocoum.
- All right, what is it?
- What?
- You're hiding something.
I'm not hiding anything.
Pocahontas, you can tell me. I promise.
I won't tell anyone... Pocahontas, look!
- It's one of them! I'm going to get...
- What are you doing here?
I had to see you again.
- Pocahontas! Pocahontas!
- Please! Don't say anything.
Quick! This way!
- But...
- Nakoma.
- Where is Pocahontas?
- I haven't seen her.
Pocahontas can't keep running off.
It's dangerous out there.
Tell her that. She listens to you.
Sure she does.
This place is incredible.
And to think we came all this way just to dig it up for gold.
- Gold?
- Hey, Meeko.
- What's gold?
- You know, it's yellow.
It comes out of the ground.
It's really valuable.
Here, we have lots of it.
Gold.
No, no! Gold is this.
There's nothing like that around here.
- No gold?
- Not that I've seen.
All this way for nothing.
Those boys are in for a big surprise.
- Will they leave?
- Some of them might.
Will you go home?
Well, it's not like I have much of a home to go back to.
I've never really belonged anywhere.
You could belong here.
What was that?
- Did you see something?
- No, no. I just...
I didn't see anything. Did I?
Look again.
Let it break upon you
Like a wave upon the sand
Hello, John Smith.
Pocahontas, that tree is talking to me.
Then you should talk back.
Don't be frightened, young man.
My bark is worse than my bite.
- Say something.
- What do you say to a tree?
Anything you want.
- So...
- Come closer, John Smith.
He has a good soul.
And he's handsome, too!
- Oh, I like her.
- I knew you would.
Smith! Smith, where are you, mate?
- We can't let them see us.
- Quick! Over here.
This place gives me the creeps.
Savages could be hiding anywhere.
If you spot one, don't ask questions.
Just shoot.
- Watch your feet, you big oaf!
- It wasn't me! It was the tree.
Of course! The tree just felt like lifting its roots...
Let's get out of here.
- Run!
- But what about Smith?
He's a big lad, he can take care of himself!
I'm glad you're on our side.
There's still some snap in these old vines.
I better get back before they send the whole camp after me.
- When will I see you again?
- Meet me tonight, right here.
Well! I haven't had this much excitement in 200 years.
What am I doing?
I shouldn't be seeing him again.
I mean, I want to see him again.
Who wouldn't? I want to see him again.
But, still, something inside is telling me it's the right thing.
Perhaps it's your dream.
My dream? Do you think he's the one the spinning arrow was pointing to?
The warriors are here.
Pocahontas, are you crazy?
What were you doing with one of them?
- There you are!
- Kocoum!
Look at them! Now we have enough warriors to destroy those white demons!
Now that we are joined by our brothers, we will defeat this enemy.
Father, I need to speak with you.
Not now, my daughter.
The council is gathering.
We don't have to fight them.
There must be a better way.
Sometimes our paths are chosen for us.
But maybe we should try talking to them.
They do not want to talk.
But if one of them did want to talk, you would listen to him, wouldn't you?
- Pocahontas...
- Wouldn't you?
Of course I would, but it is not that simple.
Nothing is simple any more.
Easy, Thomas, it's me.
- Oh, John! I could've killed you.
- Not aiming like that, you couldn't.
Keep both eyes open when you shoot.
You'll see twice as well.
- Smith! There you are.
- We were looking all over for you.
Smith! Where have you been?
I was out scouting the terrain, sir.
Excellent. Then you must know the Indians' whereabouts.
We'll need that information for the battle.
- What battle?
- We will eliminate these savages
- once and for all.
- No! You can't do that!
- Oh, can't I?
- Look. We don't have to fight them.
- John, what's gotten into you?
- I met one of them.
- You what?
- A savage?
They're not savages. They can help us.
They know the land. They know how to navigate the rivers.
- And look. It's food.
- What is it?
It's better than hardtack and gruel, that's for sure.
I like gruel.
They don't want to feed us, you ninnies!
They want to kill us!All of us!
They've got our gold, and they'll do anything to keep it!
- But there is no gold.
- No gold?
And I suppose your little
Indian friend told you this?
Yes.
Lies. Lies!All of it!
Murderous thieves.
There's no room for their kind in civilised society.
But this is their land!
This is my land!
I make the laws here.
And I say anyone who so much as looks at an Indian without killing him on sight will be tried for treason and hanged.
Pocahontas!
- Nakoma.
- Don't go out there.
I lied for you once, don't ask me to do it again.
I have to do this.
- He's one of them!
- You don't know him.
If you go out there, you'll be turning your back on your own people.
I'm trying to help my people.
Pocahontas, please, you're my best friend.
I don't want you to get hurt.
- I won't. I know what I'm doing.
- Pocahontas, no!
Ratcliffe wouldn't take us halfway around the world for nothing.
But what if Smith is right?
What if there is no gold?
If you ask me, Ratcliffe's been lying to us since we left London.
Listen to you, you bunch of idiots.
Those savages didn't attack us for nothing.
They're hiding something.
If they do have the gold,
I reckon we'll have to fight them.
- Not me. I'm not risking my neck...
- Either too hot or too cold.
I haven't been comfortable since we got here.
Me, too. I'm itching a lot.
- Follow him.
- Yes, Governor.
I want to know where he's sneaking off to.
- Yes, sir.
- If you happen to see any Indians...
...shoot them.
And, Thomas, you've been a slipshod sailor and a poor excuse for a soldier.
Don't disappoint me again.
- Kocoum.
- What is it?
- It's Pocahontas.
- What's wrong? Is she all right?
I think she's in trouble.
The earth is trembling, child.
What's happened?
The warriors are here.
- Pocahontas.
- John!
Listen to me. My men are planning to attack your people.
You've got to warn them.
Maybe it's not too late to stop this.
You have to come with me and talk to my father.
Pocahontas, talking isn't going to do any good.
I already tried talking to my men, but everything about this land has them spooked.
That's the strangest creature
I've ever seen!
Percy?
- Easy, Percy! Come here!
- Meeko, come back!
You see what I mean? Once two sides want to fight, nothing can stop them.
- Come here, both of you!
- It's all right. He's a friend.
Bad! Bad dog! Sit!
- What are you doing? Meeko!
- Percy, get back here!
- What are you doing? Stop that!
- All right, that's enough!
It's enough to make your sap boil.
Now then, there's something
I want to show you. Look!
- The ripples.
- What about them?
So small at first, then look how they grow.
But someone has to start them.
They're not going to listen to us.
Young man, sometimes the right path is not the easiest one.
Don't you see?
Only when the fighting stops can you be together.
All right. Let's go talk to your father.
Kocoum, no!
Kocoum!
Leave him alone!
Kocoum, stop!
Both eyes open.
- Thomas!
- Is he...
You killed him.
- I thought that...
- Get away from him!
Pocahontas, it won't help!
He was only...
He killed him!
Get all the wagons...
Thomas, get out of here!
Get out of here!
Who did this?
Pocahontas was out in the woods.
Kocoum went to find her and this white man attacked them.
Your weapons are strong, but now our anger is stronger.
- At sunrise, he'll be the first to die!
- But Father!
I told you to stay in the village.
You disobeyed me.
- You have shamed your father!
- I was only trying to help.
Because of your foolishness,
Kocoum is dead!
Take him away!
Kocoum was just coming to protect me.
Pocahontas...
I sent Kocoum after you.
I was worried about you.
I thought I was doing the right thing.
All this happened because of me.
And now I'll never see John Smith again.
Come with me.
Pocahontas wants to look into the eyes of the man who killed Kocoum.
Be quick.
Pocahontas.
- I'm so sorry.
- For what? This?
I've gotten out of worse scrapes than this.
Can't think of any right now, but...
It would've been better ifwe'd never met.
- None of this would've happened.
- Pocahontas, look at me.
I'd rather die tomorrow than live a hundred years without knowing you.
- Pocahontas.
- I can't leave you.
You never will.
No matter what happens to me,
I'll always be with you. Forever.
Help! Somebody help! Help!
- Help!
- Easy, lad. What is it?
It's Smith! They got him!
- Who got him?
- The savages!
- Savages?
- They captured him! Dragged him off!
- Where'd they take him?
- They headed north.
- How many were there?
- I don't know. At least a dozen.
Filthy beasts!
It's perfect, Wiggins! I couldn't have planned this better myself.
The gold is as good as mine.
We've got to save him!
He'd do the same for any of us.
Thomas is right!
We've got to do something.
And so we shall. I told you those savages couldn't be trusted.
Smith tried to befriend them, and look what they've done to him!
But now I say it's time to rescue our courageous comrade.
At daybreak, we attack!
What can you expect from filthy little heathens?
Here's what you get when races are diverse
Their skin's a hellish red
They're only good when dead
They're vermin as I said and worse
They're savages, savages
- Barely even human
- Savages, savages
Drive them from our shore!
They're not like you and me
Which means they must be evil
We must sound the drums ofwar
They're savages, savages
Dirty, shrieking devils
Now we sound the drums ofwar
This is what we feared
The paleface is a demon
The only thing they feel at all is greed
Beneath that milky hide
There's emptiness inside
I wonder ifthey even bleed
They're savages, savages
Barely even human
Savages, savages
Killers at the core
They're different from us
Which means they can't be trusted
We must sound the drums ofwar
They're savages, savages
First we deal with this one
Then we sound the drums ofwar
Savages, savages
Let's go get a few, men!
Savages, savages
Now it's up to you, men!
- Savages
- Savages
Barely even human
Now we sound the drums
Ofwar
They're going to kill him at sunrise,
Grandmother Willow.
You have to stop them.
- I can't.
- Child, remember your dream.
I was wrong, Grandmother Willow.
I followed the wrong path.
I feel so lost.
The compass.
The spinning arrow.
It's the arrow from your dream!
I was right. It was pointing to him!
- Sunrise.
- It's not too late, child!
Let the spirits of the earth guide you!
You know your path, child.
Now follow it!
This will be the day
Let's go, men!
This will be the morning
Bring out the prisoner!
We will see them dying in the dust
I don't know what I can do
Still I know I've got to try
Now we make them pay
Eagle, help my feet to fly
Now, without a warning
Mountain, help my heart be great
Now we leave them blood and bone and rust
- Spirits ofthe earth and sky
- It's them or us
Please don't let it be too late
They're a bunch of filthy, stinking savages
- Savages
- Demons
- Devils
- Kill them!
- Savages
- Savages
What are we waiting for?
Destroy their evil race until there's not a trace left
How loud are the drums ofwar?
Now we see what comes oftrying to be chums
Is the death of all I love carried in the drumming of
- War
- No!
If you kill him, you'll have to kill me too.
Daughter, stand back.
I won't! I love him, Father.
Look around you.
This is where the path of hatred has brought us.
This is the path I choose, Father.
What will yours be?
My daughter speaks with a wisdom beyond her years.
We have all come here with anger in our hearts, but she comes with courage and understanding.
From this day forward, if there is to be more killing, it will not start with me.
Release him.
Now is our chance! Fire!
- No.
- What?
- They let him go!
- They don't want to fight!
It's a trick, don't you see? Fire!
Fine! I'll settle this myself.
No!
John!
You shot him!
He stepped right into it!
It's his own fault!
- Smith was right all along.
- We never should've listened to you.
- Get the gun!
- Traitors!
Unhand me, I say. How dare you!
Put him in chains!
I'll see you all hanged for this!
And gag him as well!
Is he going to make it, Thomas?
The sooner he gets to England, the better.
Let's hope the wind is with him.
- Is the ship ready yet?
- Any minute now.
Just loading the last bit of cargo.
Untie me at once!
I'll have your head for this!
And he came so highly recommended.
The ship's almost ready.
We'd better get you on board.
We'll lose the tide.
No, not yet. She said she'd be here.
Look.
Going back is his only chance.
He'll die if he stays here.
Here.
It's from Grandmother Willow's bark.
It'll help with the pain.
What pain?
I've had worse pain than this.
Can't think of any right now, but...
You are always welcome among our people.
Thank you, my brother.
I thought you didn't like strangers.
My mother's necklace.
See ya, Percy.
Come with me?
You must choose your own path.
I'm needed here.
Then... I'll stay with you.
No. You have to go back.
- But I can't leave you.
- You never will.
No matter what happens,
I'll always be with you...
...forever.
- Good luck, lad.
- Godspeed, John.
- The crew a-ready?
- Aye, sir!
Set the mainsails.
Weigh anchor!
Let go of the topgallants!
[Fievel]
And then the hero, Wylie Burp,
squinted across the dusty street.
Hopelessly surrounded by the Cactus Cat gang, he stood his ground,
refusing to back down.
[Laughing]
Have no fear,
Billy the Kid is here.
It's too tough, kid.
Get out while you can.
If you're biting the dust,
I'm going down with ya.
[Gunshots]
[Yelling]
[Wylie Burp] You saved my life.
I'll never forget this, kid.
Here, son, I want you to have one of these.
Look out behind you.
[Female]
Fievel, your supper's ready.
[Echoing]
Ready, ready, ready.
Ouch!
Fievel!
Fievel!
#Somewhere out there #
# Beneath the pale moonlight #
# Someone's thinking of me #
#And loving me... #
[Splattering]
#And loving me... #
[Splattering]
#And loving me... #
[Man] Shut up!
Papa, they're throwing fruit and vegetables at me again.
Keep singing. Maybe they will throw some fruit for dessert.
Another night without cheese.
Yee-haa!
Howdy, Mama.
I come to rustle me up some grub.
Where have you been,
Fievel? You're late.
I had to rescue
Sheriff Wylie Burp.
He was surrounded by the Cactus Cat gang.
Oh, such a tall tale, Fievel.
And dirty hands too?
Go. Wash.
Oh, Mama, I just washed... yesterday.
I thought things would be better in America.
In Russia, my violins were famous. We never went hungry.
Maybe Tanya should sing again.
Very funny.
You'll see.
Someday I'll be a big star.
People will come from miles around.
Yeah, to eat.
Mama!
Fievel...
[Gasping]
[Grunting]
[Papa] They call America the land of opportunity.
Opportunity for what?
For children to play in the filthy streets?
To never see the sunshine?
Fievel's birthday is coming... and we don't have enough money for presents.
Oh, Papa,
I don't care.
I could sing in front of the gift shop.
- Maybe they'll throw presents.
- [Laughing]
How blessed I am to have such fine children.
Maybe things will get better.
[Crash]
Tiger?
Tiger!
Can we have an espresso and talk this over?
Listen, Tiger. You're an alley cat.
Pretty please.
Born and bred.
How true.
I got a ticket to sunshine and I'm going west.
There's a town that promises a new frontier... and a brand-new breed of cat.
Is there anything wrong with my breed?
City cats got too much purr in their fur.
Not enough growl in their howl.
Look at you.
You catnap, cat around.
Heck, I don't mean to be mean, but you're even a bit of a fraidy cat.
Who told you that?
I'm no fraidy cat.
I'll show you.
I'll show them. I'm no fraidy cat.
Tiger.
I don't want a tomcat, top cat or a tough tabby.
I just want...
How do I say this?
I just want a cat who's more like a dog.
[Neighing]
That's my ride out West.
Show me you're tough.
Don't make a fuss, okay?
[Purring]
You don't mean... this is good-bye?
There are no good-byes between you and me.
After all, we'll always have the Bronx.
Here's looking at you, kid.
The Bronx, that's right.
The Bronx, right.
I won't make a fuss.
I can handle it.
I can...
[Purring]
I can, uh... I can, uh...
[Sobbing]
# [Trombone]
Cat attack!
Cat attack!
[Yelling And Screaming]
Pay attention.
Keep it clean and tidy; plenty of violence, but no eating.
Right.
Carry on, chaps.
[Crying]
[Mama]
Fievel! Fievel!
Get in here with the family!
Oh, no! The mice!
Aw, gee!
[Cackling]
Peekaboo.
[Laughing]
Oh, I got...
I gotta do something.
I will be tough.
I will be brave.
[Tiger]
It's a spy... a spee... a spide... de... de... de... an arachnid!
Aaah!
Why, those no-good ornery varmints.
Fievel, my son.
Come back!
- Oh!
- [Thundering]
- Oh, thank heavens.
- I forgot my hat.
[Wicked Laughter]
[Papa] Fievel, come back.
Hee-ya.
[Papa] Fievel!
Fievel, my son, come back!
[Yelling]
Da...
Da-da!
- Huh?
- [Gasping]
Heh-heh-heh!
Hee-heh-heh!
[Fievel] I see you're missing an eye.
- This makes it a fair fight.
- Yeah?
That's right.
I'm talking to you, fur head.
[Growling]
Fur head?
[Gasping]
I don't care what the boss says.
This mouse is lunch.
Heh-heh-heh- heh!
Run! Run, Fievel!
- Oh, no.
- [Thundering]
[Screeching]
For your life, Fievel, run!
Mama, Tanya, get in!
Fievel!
Papa, get in!
Everybody, together, run!
Run!
Jolly, jolly good.
Now for my part.
Look!
[Screaming]
Aaah!
[Splashing]
[Coughing]
- Let's go on that ride again.
- Where did I get such a son?
[Male]
Why, howdy, fine mice.
I'm in desperate need ofhelp.
I've come into possession of railway tickets to the West.
Tickets to sunshine that I will be unable to use.
Surely there are some of y'all...
looking for a little elbow room, y'all.
Now, I ain't gonna lie.
There are problems out West.
There's a lot of bright sunshine and fresh air.
But after these opulent, aromatic sewers, that might be... upsetting for you all, you all, y'all, sorry.
I'll take one.
I'll take 15.
Hold your horses one minute, y'all.
There's plenty for everyone, yes, sirree.
Are there any cats out West?
There certainly are.
If you have prejudices... against cats you better stay put.
On the frontier cats and mice help each other.
The anointed leader of cats,
Mr. Cat R. Waul, is the most enlightened, intelligent, sophisticated, charming, non-narcissistic, debonair, suave, dashing, renaissance cats you could...
ever wish to meet.
Uh, ah, the fact is, cats even get along with the dogs out there.
Sheriff Wylie Burp is probably the finest...
law-dog in the West, actually, y'all.
Wylie Burp, wow!
Too bad there aren't any desperadoes left to round up. Hee- hee- hee!
- I'll take a ticket.
- Three tickets, please.
Don't push, please.
Plenty for all.
- Three tickets.
- Three for you, jolly good.
Come on, Papa.
Let's go.
There is opportunity out West.
Maybe they have a better appreciation of singers.
So what are we fiddling around here for?
Let's go west!
Jolly, jolly good.
Anybody still like some tickets, y'all?
[Meowing]
[Crash]
[Groaning]
Oh, those nine lives come in handy. Fiev.
[Tiger]
Fievel.
Hello.
Wow, it's empty.
Oh, no.
What's this?
Oh, no!
"Dear Tiger,
We left New York.
"We're taking the train to a town out West called Green River.
"I tried to find you to tell you, but I guess you were somewhere with Miss Kitty.
"I miss you and I hope
I see you again sometime.
Your best friend,
Fievel."
Train, the train!
They're taking the train.
[Mumbling]
[Papa]
Hurry, Mama.
The train won't wait.
I'm sure we forgot something.
Let us see.
We have your violin tools, pots and pans, your pipe, the tail curler, whisker comb... and grandpa's cheese knife.
I hope we have everything.
Don't worry.
It will be wonderful.
[Train Whistle]
[Female]
Alas, poor Yorick. I knew him well.
- [Opera Singing]
- Look, Mama, an actor and a singer.
Tanya, stop that. You shouldn't stare at the less fortunate.
Last call, all passengers bound for Altuna,
Akron, Elkhart,
Oskaloosa and Green River.
Fievel, what is wrong with you?
You should be happy.
We are going west.
I was hoping Tiger would come say good- bye.
Will I ever see him again, Papa?
Who am I to know?
Tiger was a wonderful cat, but he was still a cat.
Someday you will understand.
When, Papa?
When will I understand?
If growing up were easy, would it take so long?
Bye, Tiger, wherever you are.
You're the best cat
I ever met.
[Tiger]
I gotta catch up with that train.
Fievel, wait for me.
Wait for me, please. [Barking]
Oh, dogs, I hate those guys.
[Barking]
[Purring,
Yelling]
[Train Whistle]
Oh, good.
Fievel's train hasn't left yet.
[Growling]
- [Barking]
- I want my mommy.
Uh-oh.
[Yelling]
- Grr!
- [Blowing]
[Pinball Machine Sounds]
[Growling]
[Tiger]
Listen, you guys, be nice.
[Barking]
Oh!
[Barking]
Ah-ha-ha!
Oops!
[Yelling]
[Growling]
Cat got your tongue?
Wait!
That's definitely...
That's my train!
I want it.
Ah-ha-ha!
Please, I'll be good.
I'll always lick.
I'll always cover my...
[Stammering]
I made it.
What a stupid dog.
Na-na-na-na-na-na. Your mother was never housebroken.
Ha-ha-ha-ha!
Toodle- oo!
[Growling] Hello.
[Yelling]
[Train Whistle]
[Tiger]
Oh, no, not again.
[Barking, Growling]
Dogfish.
[Train Whistle]
Way out West, way out West, way out West, way out West.
[Train]
Way out West, way out West.
[Fievel]
Are we out West yet?
WestJersey, maybe.
# Life in New York City it's full of dread and fuss #
# Our dreams are waiting west there's room for all of us #
#The streets are paved nuggets all of purest gold #
# Soon we'll be millionaires... #
# Boy, have I been told #
[Train Whistle]
# No garbage and no landlord foulin' up the air #
# No crooks or politicians to strip our cupboards bare #
# We'll ride roaring rivers
Turn wilderness to towns #
# Our dreams will take us up and never let us down #
# Way out West there's room for dreamin'#
# There's wide open spaces to see #
# Way out West the sun's always beamin'#
# We'll be everything we can be #
#The nights are filled with dancing lasting 'til the day #
# Days are filled with singing
Work is just like play #
#We'll banjo, fiddle
We'll guitar, spoon #
# Everywhere we go out there we'll play this rousing tune #
# 'Cause way out West we'll build a new nation #
# We'll grow all the way to the sky #
# Way out West there's all of creation #
# We'll do and we'll never say die, yeehaw #
# Way out West we'll build a new nation #
# We'll go all the way to the sky #
# Way out West there's all of creation #
#We'll do and we'll never say die #
Way out West, way out West, way out West, way out West.
[Whimpering]
- Ahh, shut up.
- [Yelling]
Mother always wanted me to be on the stage.
Excuse me, sir.
Mr. Cowboy.
You wouldn't be going to Green River, would you?
[Growling]
[Tiger Groaning]
[Train Whistle]
[Mooing]
I know you.
You sold us the tickets.
Hi, my name is Fievel Mousekewitz.
[Gasping]
Heh-heh-heh-heh!
I win again, fathead.
[Male] I say you cheatin'.
You plays your last hand, Chula.
I don't think so.
I got seven more, dog chow.
Why, you dirty, rotten, low-down, double dealing...
I don't get it, boss. How come we're not munching those mice?
Oui. "Zees" fraternity "wiz" mice does run counter to nature.
Which would you rather have, the crouton or the salad?
Of course we will eat the mice,
but only after we have exploited their labors.
[Cat R. Waul]
We are nice to the mice...
because it is intelligent to be so.
If we talk sweetly, they will come in droves.
If we hiss, they will run and we will have to chase them, an unnecessary expenditure of calories.
So when do we take the big bite, boss?
When do we get to eat them?
When, when, when?
When my empire at Green River is complete... and when we have a better mousetrap.
Mouseburgers!
Mouseburgers!
Yes, mouseburgers indeed.
Music... to aid the digestion.
Help!
[Humming]
#[Violin]
Next stop: mouth, throat, stomach,
intestine and, you guessed it,
Green River.
Whoa, oh!
Whoa, whoa, oh!
Uh-oh.
What do we have here?
It appears to be a young pioneer.
The feline in me would like to devour this tender morsel, but the businessman in me knows if I do, the other mice will miss him and come looking.
But the gourmet in me quivers at the thought... of mouse tartar.
But the entrepreneur prefers not to be inundated... by suspicious mice that could jeopardize my plan.
So I must exercise... both willpower and finesse.
Scamper back to your parents, little mouse.
Do be careful.
It's hazardous out there.
- Bye.
- Give him the flying "ahh."
- Make it good.
- I love the flying "ahh"!
[Wicked Laughing]
Mouse overboard!
Where?
What?
I just love the flying "ahh."
- Ahh!
- Fievel!
Fievel, my son.
Don't be a fool,
Mousekewitz!
[Groaning]
[Tiger]
Excuse me. You got a minute?
Are there any rest stops on this trip?
Hey, wait for me.
You can't leave me here.
I burn easily.
I'm... lost, all alone in a million-acre cat box.
Phoo!
[Train Whistle]
[Mama]
My son, Fievel.
[Sniffling]
[Moaning]
You know something?
I think we got snookered.
No, Mama, this is what the land of opportunity looks like... I think.
It feels empty and lonely.
Over here, over here.
Hey, you, this is my place.
This is my place.
Wanna buy it?
[Mama] Papa, quick.
[Papa] All right, we may be slower,
but we are smarter.
All these speedy mices are fighting over the land.
In this dusty country you want to be near the water.
So this is what we left New York for.
This is what we lost Fievel for.
Chula, do this.
Chula, do that.
I'm a good-looking spider, no?
There's lots of women like to marry me.
Mama, Fievel will come.
He's a Mousekewitz.
If we work hard, Green River will be everything we dreamed.
The water, for instance.
In days it will be a beautiful waterfall.
That patch of mud will be a rich field covered with grain.
Prairie dogs will graze on that land, and the city will prosper.
The water.
Without water...
how can we survive?
Please, there's no need for such a bleak assessment of your situation.
After all, what are neighbors for?
A cup of sugar, a saucer of cream.
A pail of water, perhaps.
Water? I'll give 'em water.
[Spitting]
I'd like to share a vision.
A vision of a better world.
My eyes!
A world where cats and mice live and work side by side.
A world where mothers raise their mouselings without fear.
Where musicians receive their proper due.
Where young mousettes fulfill their every, dream.
Will you help me build this world?
[Cheering]
Water,
I need water.
Fievel.
I'm right here.
Mama, I'm coming.
Mama, I'm right here.
Fievel.
Mama, I'm coming.
Mama.
[Echoing]
Fievel.
[Echoing]
Fievel.
Mama! Papa!
Mama.
Yeo-o-o-o-ow!
This is the worst moment of my life.
I wouldn't wish this on a dog.
Maybe a dog.
# Oh, my darling
Oh, my darling #
[Female] Who?
# Oh, my darling... #
# Oh, my darling #
Who?
It's Tiger, your darling.
Don't you recognize me?
- Who?
- It's me, Tiger.
Your darling baby buppie-bunga-boo.
Hey, you're not my darling.
I just kissed an owl.
[Fievel Echoing]
Tiger!
- Fievel?
- Tiger!
Fievel, I've been searching all over for you.
Tiger, is that you?
[Tiger Echoing] Fievel.
Nope, bet it's another mirage.
Fievel, I can't tell you how much...
I wish you weren't a mirage.
Hi, mirage of Tiger.
Hi, mirage of Fievel.
Don't they ever dust this place?
A guy could make a fortune selling... vacuum cleaners.
Dancing buffalo bones.
Naw.
[War Cries]
[Chanting]
Come on, fellows.
I'm a mangy, old cat.
I don't taste good without ketchup.
Ummm. No. No, ma'am.
I'm not your color.
Could we have an espresso and talk this over, please?
How... do you do?
[Speaking In
Mousehican Dialect]
Huh?
Ah.
Hee-hee-hee.
[Gasping]
[Screeching]
[Groaning]
[Hawk Screeching]
Mama!
[Echoing]
Papa!
[Chanting]
[Laughing]
They think I'm their Tiger god.
How lucky can you get?
I mean, how did they know I was a vegetarian?
Mm-mm-mm.
[Burping]
It's funny how your appetite perks up when you find out... that you're gonna eat dinner instead of be dinner.
Innkeeper, more wine.
[War Cries]
[Mousehican Dialect]
Shhh!
[Fievel] I said put me down, you ugly furball.
I won't stand for this.
Put me down.
[Clucking]
Uh-oh.
Help!
Water!
Oh, no, I'm in a mouth.
[Screams]
[Coughing,
Gulping]
A little endive went down the wrong tube.
I hope he doesn't throw up.
- Get me out of here!
- Who said that?
[Fievel] Me.
Me, he says.
- Say "ah."
- Ah.
- Tiger!
- Fievel!
I thought I'd never see you.
We waited for you at the station.
Believe me,
I tried to get there, but I was dogged every step of the way.
Oh, Tiger, you're my best friend.
C'mon on, let's go to Green River.
There's something
I forgot to mention.
The only reason I'm not a moccasin right now... is because they think
I'm a god.
This conversation is making me look very ungodlike.
Tiger, listen.
I have to warn my family.
The cats are gonna turn them into mouse... shh!
These folks get offended if you eat and run.
I'll join you as soon as I can.
You promise?
I promise.
Cross my heart and hope to cry.
Oh, Tiger.
I almost forgot.
How do you get to Green River?
Grab a passing sagecoach.
See you later.
Adios.
Sagecoach, get it?
Sage.
Oh, never mind.

Excuse me,

I was wondering if you could give me some help.
[Sputtering]
Oh, another tumbleweed asking me for help.
Oh, no, not again.
[Snoring]
Not again.
[Burping]
[Cuckoo Clock]
Mama! Papa! Tanya!
Our Fievel, he's alive.
Fievel, my baby.
He's come back to us.
Mousekewitz, don't let go!
Oh, Fievel.
What happened to you?
I got lost in this desert.
This giant hawk picked me up and dropped me... right on the Mousehican village where Tiger is a god.
Papa,
I have to warn you.
The cats, they're gonna build this giant mousetrap.
They're gonna turn us into mouseburgers!
A giant mousetrap and Tiger is a god?
Fievel's been out in the sun too long.
Mousekewitz!
But Tiger is a god and they are building a giant mousetrap.
Fievel, the only thing that has grown... faster than you are your tall tales.
You will see that out West cats are good.
- [Gasping]
- [Cheering]
- Huh?
- [Muttering]
[Muttering]
So, what's your problem?
Being nice to these mice.
It's driving me nuts!
Get on with it, you morons!
After the saloon is finished tomorrow,
we announce that we are going to have a special ceremony.
We invite all of the mice...
"und" seat them in the stands.
"Und" when the sun goes down...
[Cat R. Waul] Snappo!
- Mouseburgers.
- Mouseburgers!
Let me hear that again.
Mouseburgers!
Let the saliva flow!
Mouseburgers!
[Female]
#La la-la- la-la #
# La la-la-la-la #
# La, la, la, la #
Next.
[Yelling]
Terrible, terrible.
Truly, utterly appalling.
I must have a voice to match the opulence of this saloon.
Ooh!
Pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy.
Pussy, pussy, oh, pussy.
Humans, yech!
So shiny and bleah!
Right, I want the subversive... who attempted to assassinate me found.
I love finding subversives.
[Spitting]
What's a subversive?
Someone who doesn't have long to live.
# [Music]
If it isn't my friend from the train.
I heard what you said about mouseburgers.
I'm gonna tell everyone.
I'm gonna get Wylie Burp
'cause he's the law. Wylie Burp?
[Laughing]
That quaint historical figure.
Put simply,
I am the law here.
You're a mere hors d'oeuvre.

Not just any mouse.
This is a diva.
Diva, schmever.
Put a mouse on the stage... and your saloon's gonna be as empty as Death Valley...
on a cold day in June when the snow don't fall.
What?
They'll love her, adore her.
Those who don't will answer to me.
Anything you say, pussypoos.
I have mentioned I dislike being referred to as pussypoos.
Yeah? I'm not so happy about being dumped... in nature's ashtray 500 miles from a pastrami sandwich.
Pussypoos.
I just mentioned, didn't I, that I dislike being referred to as pussypoos.
As for the mousette, I'll get her on the stage for ya.
See that you do.
Farewell, my diva.
- Now then...
- [Gasping]
Don't worry, mousey.
You're safe now.
So you're really not tough and mean like you were acting?
Who, me?
Naw.
I'm soft as this powder puff and twice as gentle.
But living out here around characters like that...
What's your name, honey?
Tanya.
Tanya Mousekewitz.
And you want to be a great singer.
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
What's the matter?
You're shaking like a rattlesnake tail.
I'm scared. I've never sang in front of a real audience.
[Crash,
Laughing]
Sweetie, you wouldn't be an artiste... if you weren't nervous.
I'm not pretty.
Says who?
You can be whatever you want if you believe in yourself.
Show me some grit and guts.
Come on, honey.
Give me a smile.
Oh, no, no.
Sweetheart, you can do better than that.
Think of something real nice.
I want you to reach deep down... and find the most beautiful thought that's in your heart.
Oh, beautiful.
Um.
Tonight, Tanya, forget you're in this cowpie hole-of- an-olive-pit town.
You're with your fella at the El Purrocco club.
You're on that stage, and he has a front row seat.
You're singing your heart out just for him.
There are things there
I miss so much.
[Kiss Sound]
I've forgotten why I left.
So much for regrets.
- So, do you like yourself?
- I look like a real lady.
Remember, the real lady is what's under the mask.
Now go knock 'em dead.
[Chula] Oh, dear, oh, dear.
He's not cookin'evenly.
[Humming]
Yeow!
[Cat R. Waul]
Gentle creatures, I have arranged... for a special preview of the artistic virtuosity... that will become of commonplace on this stage.
Allow me to present the divine diva,
Miss Tanya!
[Clapping]
[Cat Laughing]
- I can't do this.
- Sure you can.
If anyone throws so much as a radish at you,
I'll slap 'em so hard their meow'll fall off.
# [Fanfare]
Huh?
Oh.
A mouse!
Throw the mouse out of the house!
# Do you ever miss... #
[Booing]
The boss has hit the catnip again.
What's wrong with the boss?
# Do you ever miss the girl #
# You left behind #
Gosh!
Gosh!
Gosh!
# Is the girl you left behind out there tonight romancin' #
# Makin' eyes at someone else and singin'
Is she dancin' #
[Chula] Come back mouse!
You wouldn't want me to miss dinner!
# Puts teardrops in your eyes from secrets she is keepin' #
I'm blind!
Help, Tanya!
# Have the fiddlers play a tune and dance the night away #
I'm not here, you pointed head.
# You know you'll always miss her #
# Lonely is the lover's heart if only you could kiss her kiss her, kiss her #
Come here!
Come here! Aah!
[Cowboy]
Durn mouse!
Bugger face!
#Just don't leave 'em too darn long,
I think I oughta warn ya #
#Absence makes the heart grow cold and makes a heart to wander #
# If you stay by their side you'll feel their hearts grow fonder #
# Hope you see her someday
Hope I find my way #
# Back to the girl
I left behind #
#Tell me you will never roam #
#We swear we won't go roamin' #
#You'll be by your fireside #
#We'll all be home sweet homin' #
# Kiss her miss her, kiss her #
# Inky-dinky spider caught a mouse in his web #
#The inky-dinky spider bit off the mouse's head #
Hee-hee-hee!
Ow! I'm in pain!
#Where's the girl you left behind #
# She's waitin' for her sister #
#We won't stop until we're home
We'll hug and kiss her #
# I'll find the girl
I'll find the girl #
# I'll find the girl
I'll find the girl I left behind #
#Tonight, tonight, tonight
That's right, all right #
[Applause And Cheering]
Encore, encore!
[Sneezes]
[Cheering]
Tanya, let's get out of here.
I must stay.
My public needs me.
I can't leave you.
It's dangerous.
"Thank you for your... a-du-lation."
Tanya.
[Wylie]
What's the matter, son?
Did you ever know something important but nobody will believe ya?
Boy, I wish
Wylie Burp was here.
You do?
Well, then, he... he... he's right here.
Where?
The old dog's right under your whiskers.
[Snoring]
Read the badge, son.
"Wylie Burp, Sheriff."
Wow!
We need you, Sheriff Burp.
The cats are gonna turn us into mouseburgers. You gotta help us now!
Let this sleepin' dog lie, son.
Doggone it, I'm dog tired. I'm tired of leadin' a dog's life... and fighting like cats and dogs against cats and dogs, and young pups doggin' my trail trying to become top dog.
I'm goin' to the dogs in a dog-eat-dog world, son.
I'm so far over the hill,
I'm on the bottom of the other side.
[Snoring]
But you know,
I think I might be able to help ya.
How? We've only got
'til sundown tomorrow.
Gotta find me a dog.
I'll teach him the stuff.
I'll make a hero out of him.
I don't know any dogs... but I do know a god!
Oh, no, I can't.
You got the wrong cat.
I am a god of eternal peace and cosmic love, my friend.
But why argue?
I'm here, you're here.
We're all here.
But we're going to Green River.
You're going to Green River.
I'm gonna stay right here.
So, you know, give my regards to everybody.
[Purring]
Too bad... because there's a very, very pretty cat there you might remember.
My darling baby bubby-bunka- boo.
[Purring]
Oh.
You convinced me!
What do I gotta do?
Ah, it ain't nothin' much.
You just gotta pretend to be a dog!
A dog!
You got it.
A dog!
Tiger... anyone can be a god, but... it takes grit to be a dog!
So you're the frivolous feline
I've got to whip into shape?
I've got my work cut out for me.
I don't have to listen to this.
I... am a god!
Yeah?
Yeah!
- Yeah? Yeah?
- Yeah! Yeah!
I don't have to listen to this. I'm a god!
Fetch, dog.
- Moi?
- [Snarls]
Aah!
[Humming]
[Giggling]
Hmm.
No, no.
All wrong.
What did I do wrong?
You want me to dribble all over it?
You wanna act like a dog, you gotta think like a dog...
'til you smell like a dog.
No self-respecting dog fetches anything, unless he's good and feels like it.
You wanna intimidate someone, give 'em the la-a-zy eye.
Gee, I'm afraid to ask.
Okay, what's the la- a-zy eye?
The la-a-zy eye!
Wah!
Woof.
Now you do it.
[Grunting]
[Yelling]
Hopeless.
[Grunting]
Now, lemme see you walk.
You're wiggling like a French poodle.
Get down on all fours and get a snoot full of mother earth.
Yuck! That goes against my grain.
Yech!
Roll, you varmint. Roll.
Give yourself a dirt bath.
Now you're gettin' it.
C'mon. We're rootin' for ya.
Get up. Suck in your paunch, boy.
Saunter on out there, one leg in front of the other, slow and easy.
Woosh!
I hurt myself.
If you're gonna act like a dog, you gotta sound like a dog.
Let's hear you bark.
[Sputters]
Well, go ahead.
Bow-wow.
Bow-wow?
It's more like... bark!
Bark.
No, again.
Woof.
Again.
Woof! Rawf!
Raft! Racket!
Rap! Rapscallion!
Rumpelstiltskin!
Redincta gracio, amore!
Oh, this is embarrassing.
Try growling.
Grr!
Grr-rrr.
[Growling]
[Fievel] C'mon, Tiger.
We're running out of time.
Now...
[Roars]
Bark!
[Echoes]
Woof, woof!
[Echoing]
Woof, woof!
Bow-wow-wow-wow-wow.
Ha-ha-ha- ha.
Woof-woof-woof!
Grr!
Grr! Bark, bark!
Bow-wow!
Bark-bark, bark-bark-bark.
Woof-woof-woof.
Bark-bark-bark.
Bark-bark-bark.
Woof-woof-woof.
[Barking Noises]
Woof!
Ten-hut!
Grr.
- [Gasps]
- Who?
[Cat R. Waul]
Jolly good. Now pay attention.
Cats and gentle mice, lend me your ears.
It is my distinguished pleasure to invite all of you... to share our dinner... triumph!
To share our triumph!
Today we herald in a momentous... new feast... ival.
"Feastival..." festival.
To mark this brilliant and illustrious snack occasion,
I will, with these golden scissors, hereby cut the red... ribbon.
[Applause]
Bravo!
[Cheering]
Cat R. Waul, we've come to close you down.
Okay, chaps, it's become necessary to put these dogs... through obedience school.
Kill.
Oh, look out behind you, kid.
Aaah!
Oh, who's that dog down there with Wylie?
He's got some stuff!
Hee-hee-hee-hee!
Ha-ha.
That's Fievel?
It's too tough, kid.
Get out while you still can.
Okay. Toodle-oo.
Hey, Tiger.
Give 'em the la- a-zy eye!
Run for your lives!
Morons.
Trigger the mousetrap!
It's a giant mousetrap!
It's a giant mousetrap!
They're gonna squash the mice!
Now!
[Tanya] # Oh, say, can you see #
- # You're on a mousetrap #
- Stop!
You'll crush the diva!
Flee! Run, run.
Run, every, body.
Run for your lives!
Freeze, you miserable vermin!
[Gunshots]
Run for your lives!
- Yee-haw!
- Aah! Aah!
Now you freeze, cat R. Waul.
Don't pull it, kid, or you've seen the last of Miss Kitty.
Get your hands off me!
Grr... owl!
Help! Help!
[Barking]
- Take that!
- Oh, ho-ho-ho!
I never taught him that one.
[Huffing]
You harm one patch of fur on her and I'll tear you apart, one leg at a time.
[Yelling And
Whimpering]
Aaah!
Ooo.
Okay, Wylie.
- Let 'em rip, kid.
- Yes, sir, Mr. Burp, sir.
[Grunting]
[Screaming]
[Yelling]
And now...
[Growling] revenge!
[Woman]
Oh, pussypoos! Oh, no!
Come to Mommy, darling.
Mommy's going to take care of you for ever and ever... and ever!
[Mice
Indistinct Chatter]
[Cheering]
Papa, Mama!
Fievel, my baby!
Ha-ha! Our Fievel is not so little anymore.
And a regular
Western hero.
Now it's time for music.
Let's celebrate!
# [Square Dance]
[Grunts]
Tiger!
Oh, Tiger.
I never taught him that one.
[Gasps]
Wylie.
[Howling]
Here, son.
I want you to have one of these.
I can't. I'm not a hero like you... well, not really.
Well, maybe not.
Maybe a real hero's the last one to hear about it.
But you pulled me out of a gutter... and for that
I owe you some thanks.
Just remember, Fievel, one man's sunset is another man's dawn.
I don't know what's out there...
beyond those hills, but if you ride yonder, head up, eyes steady, heart open,
I think one day you'll find...
that you're the hero you've been lookin'for.
#I lose my way #
#No one cares #
# The words I say #
#No one hears #
#My life it seems #
#Is a world of dreams #
#Deep in the night #
# You'll find me #
#Dream, and you're right #
#Behind me #
#Stay #
#If you will stay #
# We'll dream the night away #
#Dreams to dream #
#In the dark of the night #
# When the world goes wrong #
#I can still make it right #
#I can see so far in my dreams #
#I'll follow my dreams #
# Until they come true #
# There is a star #
# Waiting to guide us #
#Shining inside us #
# When we close our eyes #
# Come with me #
# You will see what I mean #
# There's a world inside #
#No one else ever sees #
# You will go so far #
#In my dreams #
#Somewhere in my dreams #
# Your dreams will come true #
#Don't let go #
#If you stay close to me #
#In my dreams tonight #
# You will see what I see #
#Dreams to dream #
#As near as can be #
#Inside you and me #
# They always come #
# True #
#Inside you and me #
# They always come #
# True #
