{3443}{3493}Good morning.|This is your wake-up call.
{3493}{3582}Thank you for staying|at the New Darwin Inn.
{3584}{3640}The time is 10:30 a.m.
{3751}{3833}You have no new messages.
{3939}{4001}Johnny?
{4021}{4066}- Yeah?|- Never mind.
{4234}{4304}NAS: Nerve Attenuation Syndrome.
{4306}{4355}So where is home?
{4356}{4406}Johnny?
{4407}{4454}Home?
{4562}{4633}Would you believe|I don't even know?
{4635}{4677}Yes. I would.
{4679}{4723}Going out?
{4747}{4785}Getting some ice.
{4891}{4923}We've got...
{4965}{5004}ice.
{5493}{5539}Pick it up, Ralfi.
{5556}{5595}How about it?
{5596}{5675}You said you'd lock down a date|for the procedure.
{5677}{5724}And hello to you too.
{5725}{5796}Ralfi. The date. When?
{5797}{5898}I'm sorry, Johnny. The Sheba surgeons|have changed their quote.
{5899}{5963}You told me 800K would cover it.
{5965}{6025}The fee for removing the implant|is now one-million-five.
{6025}{6098}That is complete memory recovery.
{6100}{6156}If you don't want it all back...
{6157}{6210}they may come down.
{6261}{6330}If I just wanted the silicon|dug out of my brain...
{6332}{6382}I could go to Mexico City!
{6384}{6479}I want a full restoration!|I want it all back.
{6481}{6564}Johnny, the Sheba boys,|they set the price.
{6566}{6634}- I've done what I can.|- Come on, Ralfi.
{6636}{6693}One more run, Johnny.
{6694}{6762}And then you could cover it,|provided it's a rich one.
{6837}{6876}What have you got?
{6878}{6969}It depends.|Did you get that upgrade?
{7029}{7142}Very good. Pick-up is in central Beijing|tomorrow night, 10:00.
{7144}{7213}This is the big one.
{7215}{7261}Don't be late, Johnny.

{11816}{11850}No shit.
{11880}{11949}We approached you|through the correct channels.
{11951}{12053}We paid half to the Swiss account|exactly as your agent instructed.

{14976}{15035}click on three frames off the TV.
{15076}{15163}Any three. They'll meld with the data,|and I won't know what they are.

{26193}{26247}Tokyo wants me to recover|the stolen data...
{26247}{26300}for PharmaKominat Industries|of Zurich.
{26360}{26421}Our operation in Beijing|met with limited success.
{26421}{26477}The PharmaKom traitors are dead.
{26478}{26536}The courier, however,|escaped with the data.
{26536}{26582}He's on his way here,|to Newark.
{26627}{26694}I didn't want to disturb you|in your grief.
{26695}{26783}It must be very difficult|to lose an only child.
{26928}{26962}I can't say.
{27066}{27152}I'm to recover the head|of the mnemonic courier...
{27153}{27210}cryogenically preserved.
{27211}{27265}The traitors wiped|the PharmaKom mainframe.
{27265}{27313}If we lose the courier...
{27315}{27354}they've lost the data forever.
{27356}{27408}If the courier is in Newark...
{27409}{27470}it's my responsibility.
{27472}{27524}You have part of the courier's...
{27526}{27577}download code.
{28126}{28190}Just what's the deal here?
{28192}{28262}Johnny boy, my ass.|What's the fucking score here?
{28264}{28320}I'm way overloaded, man.
{28321}{28375}You would not believe how much.
{28377}{28433}You told me you got upgraded.
{28435}{28513}Yeah, I did.|I got the goods.
{28515}{28593}I want them out of my head.|Did they get the code out?
{28595}{28670}Don't worry.|They said they can extract.
{28672}{28724}Extract?
{28778}{28867}What's going on, Ralfi?|This feels like a blown deal, man.
{28869}{28933}You say you have to get|the data out.
{28935}{29033}They are the only ones who can do it.|There's no other choice.
{29034}{29127}Trust me. I will tell the driver|where to take you.
{29593}{29648}Spider, I need to get some work.
{29650}{29703}About these episodes|you've been having.
{29703}{29768}I want to get you back to the shop|for some tests.
{29770}{29824}Hey, are you listening?
{29850}{29896}No more playing doctor,|remember?
{29898}{29960}That's not what I meant.
{30009}{30043}Look.
{30045}{30098}They must be the oldest bodyguards|in town.
{30098}{30155}I'm twice as fast as they are.
{30157}{30213}I'm worried about|your nervous system!
{30215}{30282}Especially it you continue|being a bodyguard.
{30443}{30491}Get out of here, bitch.
{30493}{30539}Take it easy.
{30583}{30644}Your hired muscle's|aging on you, Ralfi.
{30681}{30719}I could've done you.
{30720}{30767}Time you hired|some young and fast.
{30769}{30832}You mean like you?
{30834}{30891}You're the best agent|for bodyguards in town.
{30921}{30974}I'm the fastest,|now Spider's jacked my system.
{30974}{31015}Hold out your hand.
{31048}{31087}Okay.
{31115}{31205}Fine. Just hold it there.
{31263}{31301}So?
{31303}{31377}Just hold it there.|You can hold it.
{31379}{31439}- Can't you?|- Yeah. Sure.
{31511}{31542}See?
{31556}{31600}Cheap street implants.
{31644}{31681}You're damaged goods.
{31683}{31744}Spider man jacked you up|all right.
{31746}{31799}Jacked her up so tight|she shakes.
{31801}{31882}I cannot use you,|not for muscle.
{31884}{31978}Ever considered something|a little less actively physical?
{31980}{32048}Like on your back, babe?
{32050}{32113}Or on your knees.
{32153}{32199}I'll get a gig, Ralfi.
{32201}{32250}Then I'm coming back for you.
{32252}{32296}Sure.
{32891}{32942}Yo, J-Bone.
{33240}{33305}What you clocking, man?
{33307}{33353}Some suit out from the city.
{33355}{33388}What for?
{33390}{33485}I don't know.|Suits don't come out here.
{34131}{34171}You're Johnny?
{34172}{34206}Am I?
{34207}{34278}I sure hope so.|Come on in.
{34280}{34329}We're here to help you.
{34552}{34624}We've got to stop meeting|like this.
{34626}{34663}Baldy.
{34664}{34704}Doctor will see you now.
{34788}{34838}You lied.
{35019}{35057}Time to die.
{35059}{35092}Time?
{35426}{35508}We've got all night, asshole!
{35509}{35598}- Let me see it.|- Shut up, man.
{36097}{36124}Yo, J-man.
{36857}{36897}Toad!
{36980}{37018}You weren't on the menu.
{37020}{37094}- I want you to do something.|- Do?
{37095}{37159}Yes. Say 'bye.
{37375}{37422}Hold it right there.
{37996}{38038}You're tooling up.
{38064}{38127}As long as you understand|one thing:
{38128}{38210}We're even.|I don't owe you shit.
{38235}{38273}Who are you?
{38275}{38336}I'm J-Bone.
{38338}{38384}I run Heaven.
{38450}{38497}The LoTek headquarters.
{38782}{38873}Easy as apple pie|Easy as app--
{38875}{38932}- Johnny!|- They were waiting for me, Ralfi.
{38932}{38987}Two big, nasty men!
{38989}{39076}Johnny, please.|Let me explain. Johnny!
{39078}{39147}You set me up, my friend.
{39148}{39235}Johnny, it's not my fault.|There's been a screw-up!
{39237}{39318}You're dead if you don't get|this stuff out of my head.
{39378}{39434}Shit!
{39435}{39503}Not on the head!
{39505}{39550}Don't tell me you hit him|on the head.
{39886}{39932}This way.
{40082}{40140}Hooky, give me my shit.
{40142}{40188}Come on.
{40880}{40881}Looks like he's coming 'round.
{40881}{40935}Looks like he's coming 'round.
{41067}{41114}How you feeling, Johnny?
{41143}{41182}What'd they upload?
{41184}{41255}The goddamn Library of Congress?
{41257}{41322}Feels like my brain's gonna explode.
{41324}{41414}I think your friend|can take care of that.
{41582}{41689}Ralfi, you lying sack of shit.
{41691}{41740}Please, let's work this out|like gentlemen.
{41740}{41812}In this business, you only fuck up once|with the Yakuza.
{41814}{41856}We'll need a bucket.
{42012}{42057}Put it here beside the table.
{42059}{42098}Can we talk?
{42100}{42138}Talk.
{42140}{42203}I have one image of the access code.|You have the other two.
{42205}{42270}I'll give you the data.|Everybody happy.
{42272}{42332}You don't understand.
{42334}{42423}They want the data and|everything it's ever been stored in.
{42425}{42482}There's less danger|of information decay.
{42482}{42542}We don't have to worry|about anyone going in...
{42542}{42593}with mnemonic sensors.
{42640}{42690}These days, you see...
{42748}{42803}dead men can tell tales.
{42805}{42889}There's some way|to work this out!
{42891}{42917}There is.
{43064}{43138}Hurry up. Please.
{43493}{43531}What is going on?
{43533}{43586}I'll slit his fucking throat, bitch.
{43588}{43669}So? The other guy's gonna|cut his whole head off.
{43671}{43800}- Say we pay you to walk away?|- I'll pay 20 grand.
{43824}{43885}You wouldn't believe|the shit you're in.
{43885}{43907}Fifty.
{43940}{43968}Deal.
{44012}{44043}You bitch!
{44748}{44798}It's okay.|I got the gun. Let's go.
{44874}{44938}Time to go!
{44940}{44964}Bitch!
{45111}{45187}Hey! You could have|fucking killed me!
{45189}{45243}Get out of my way!
{45664}{45698}What are you doing?
{45700}{45735}My gear.
{46546}{46593}In here.
{47948}{47976}Back door.
{47978}{48021}Thanks, J-Bone.
{48046}{48084}We'll find you again!
{48086}{48126}Count on it!
{48197}{48244}Down!
{48300}{48365}You LoTeks will regret this.
{48530}{48614}I have to get on-line.|Must be some way to square this.
{48615}{48674}Fifty thou', you said.
{48702}{48746}Time I see the color.
{48747}{48819}Right. You were terrific.
{48821}{48904}So if you'll point the way out|and give me an account number--
{48905}{48952}Account number?
{48978}{49026}I'm on you till you pay.
{49174}{49224}How come they want|to cut off your head?
{49224}{49279}Usually they just|off people around here.
{49279}{49310}Long story.
{49312}{49374}I'm gonna be around|until I get paid, so--
{49376}{49459}I can carry nearly 80 gigs of data|in my head.
{49461}{49508}160 if I use a doubler.
{49509}{49592}But somebody stuck in more,|and I don't know how to get it out.
{49594}{49665}Wait. You're a smuggler?|In your head?
{49729}{49801}What's wrong?
{49851}{49900}Come here. Sit down.
{50020}{50084}Oh, man, you are fucked up severe.
{50134}{50204}Stay quiet, boy. Okay?
{50420}{50457}Papa!
{50543}{50585}Takahashi. How sad.
{50587}{50640}The loss of a child.
{50642}{50742}They know that your purpose|in life has been lost.
{50743}{50791}It died with your daughter.
{50793}{50860}You have become a risk to them.
{50862}{50912}Take a good look|at their errand boy.
{50914}{50982}The one who wants|the courier's head.
{50984}{51021}He's plotting to destroy you.
{51023}{51101}You must neutralize him,|Takahashi.
{51103}{51159}I promise you...
{51161}{51248}the courier,|what he carries...
{51250}{51301}can give you new purpose in life.
{51303}{51391}I was PharmaKom,|and l--
{51417}{51460}They're listening.
{51501}{51537}They're everywhere.
{52205}{52271}It's just my stuff.
{52273}{52373}Mace, throwing spikes, grenade.
{52375}{52422}Everything a girl needs.
{52468}{52522}You let me sleep?
{52523}{52562}You needed it.
{52658}{52717}I'm in a hurry.
{52719}{52785}I'm dead it I don't get this|out of my head.
{52880}{52975}Hey. Do you ever sneak a look|at what you carry?
{52977}{53067}Usually there's a code,|like a lock.
{53068}{53116}Well, when there isn't?
{53118}{53181}No. It goes with the territory.
{53183}{53256}Safer for me|and the client.
{53258}{53311}How come you knew those, uh--
{53313}{53359}Oh, call them LoTeks.
{53360}{53425}I sort of hung with them|when I was a kid.
{53466}{53562}How do you fit all that shit|in your head anyway?
{53564}{53637}Must have been pretty good|at memorizing, huh?
{53639}{53693}Implant. Wet-wired.
{53695}{53751}I had to dump a chunk|of long-term memory.
{53751}{53805}You had to dump what?
{53806}{53840}My childhood.
{53842}{53888}Your childhood?
{53952}{53997}Really?
{54032}{54141}All of it?|You can't remember a thing?
{54143}{54192}Maybe there's some residual traces.
{54194}{54303}Every now and then there's something,|but I can never hold onto it.
{54305}{54359}That's a seriously|weird-ass thing to do.
{54359}{54429}Maybe I didn't lose anything|I wanted to keep.
{54431}{54493}I needed the space for the job.
{54495}{54541}You got parents and stuff?
{54543}{54609}You got parents and stuff?
{54611}{54673}Yeah. Once.
{54674}{54760}But I haven't seen them in years.
{54762}{54846}Anyway, I don't think|about it much, okay?
{54848}{54904}What do you think about?
{54936}{54984}When you're alone?
{54986}{55073}I think I want to get out|of this rat hole.
{55075}{55187}I want to get on-line.|I need a computer!
{55215}{55261}Where'd you learn to do that?
{55263}{55330}I used to have a summer job|breaking and entering.

{67269}{67346}You strung out or what?|You got NAS!
{67362}{67400}You have the black shakes.

{67528}{67601}I've got to make this meeting.|Hey! Can you hear me?
{67699}{67768}Spider. He could help you !
{67770}{67826}He could help me.

{69799}{69884}It's not my work that got her this way.|My work is clean.
{69885}{69937}Besides, you don't get this shit|from amp jobs.
{69937}{69966}That's a myth.
{69967}{70045}So what does cause it?
{70047}{70096}The world causes it.|This causes it!
{70133}{70203}Information overload,|all the electronics...
{70205}{70243}poisoning the airwaves!
{70245}{70315}Technological fucking civilization!
{70317}{70414}But we still have all this shit,|because we can't live without it.

{71007}{71053}He really a preacher, J-Bone?
{71055}{71152}Preacher? That motherfucker's|got God and technology ass-backward.
{71154}{71237}He'll kill anybody for money|just to keep his body full of implants.
{71239}{71270}Want me to follow him?

{74895}{74925}Who is she?
{74926}{74968}You expect me to remember...
{74970}{75012}half the shit?
{75014}{75050}Heal!
{75203}{75305}Oh, man.|Why'd you have to do that?
{75442}{75499}- Who's the girl?|- A wanna be.
{75501}{75598}She's always hanging around here|looking for a job.
{75600}{75635}Name?
{75637}{75715}Jane.
{75717}{75800}More.
{75802}{75866}- One of Spider's jobs.|- Spider?
{75867}{75976}He's a flesh mechanic--|implants and shit, you know?
{75978}{76089}They said he used to|be a legit doctor once, but--
{76091}{76116}Where?
{76705}{76785}They did some serious shoehorning|to get that in there.
{76787}{76858}Let's skip the technical critique.|I need some help.
{76860}{76894}You don't know the half.
{76895}{76964}Must be hurting like hell.
{76966}{77061}Think I need you to tell me that?|I got 320 gigs in here.
{77063}{77148}Yeah? What is it exactly?
{77149}{77196}What kind of stuff?
{77198}{77312}I haven't got a clue, and I don't have|a download code either.
{77481}{77527}Hey.
{77574}{77620}You doing okay?
{77645}{77684}Good girl, Janie.
{77686}{77741}You brought him to the right place.
{77743}{77786}You can fix him?
{77787}{77837}I don't know.
{77839}{77898}With his seepage,|if I could work a download...
{77898}{77976}I don't know|if the product would be coherent.
{77978}{78059}Fuck the product.|I just want it out.
{78061}{78099}I wish it was that simple.
{78145}{78194}Allcome. Dr. Allcome.
{78196}{78230}Ever hear that name?
{78231}{78279}- Maybe.|- Where is he?
{78280}{78353}Maybe! Why do you want to see him?
{78355}{78401}Oh, come on, Spider.
{78403}{78496}I'll make sure Just Johnny|gets to see who he needs to see...
{78497}{78587}but you need bed rest, down time.
{78588}{78654}He's my client.
{78656}{78717}I'm telling you,|you've got to sleep!
{78718}{78773}Just tell me where to go.
{78883}{78940}All right.|I'll drive you.
{78942}{78971}Right.
{79216}{79256}- Halt, sinners!|- Fuck!
{79257}{79298}Spider, look out!
{79403}{79447}Who the fuck was that?
{79449}{79494}You don't want to know.
{79596}{79642}Jesus.
{80082}{80128}Where are we?
{80130}{80176}You'll see.
{80757}{80860}He's been this way for an hour now.|I don't know what to do with him.
{80862}{80911}If we still got any Paralon B,|give him 20 mg's.
{80911}{80958}Fucking PharmaKom, man.
{80960}{81057}That shit costs two grand|per clinical unit.
{81132}{81197}Okay, keep him warm|and bring his charts.
{81492}{81539}Here are the charts, Doctor.
{81566}{81621}Where's Dr. Allcome?
{81622}{81714}Dr. Allcome is a name|used when we've got a major problem...
{81715}{81777}and don't want to spook the patients.
{81779}{81879}"Doctor all come to ward seven."
{81881}{81943}We drop everything|and haul ass to wherever.
{81943}{82024}Usually means a crazy, somebody violent.
{82026}{82062}But I saw it on the fax buffer.
{82064}{82116}That tax was meant tor us.
{82142}{82233}Who's "us?"|Hey, wait a minute!
{82285}{82320}Who's "us?"
{82322}{82394}The NAS underground.|People who keep this place going.
{82395}{82463}People like me.|Get on the table.
{82492}{82532}Why?
{82534}{82624}Don't be a bigger asshole than you|have to. Just get on the table.
{82833}{82882}All right.
{82884}{82930}Jack in.
{83088}{83134}Lie down.
{83215}{83274}Let's take a look at this shit.
{83307}{83346}No access code?
{83348}{83396}Except for one image|out of three.
{83398}{83479}It won't help.|What'd they use? Random images?
{83481}{83529}Yeah. From the TV.
{83531}{83628}I've got some decryption codes here.|I'll run them.
{83629}{83679}Janie, you should|really lie down.
{83681}{83717}Can you break the code?
{83719}{83782}If I get lucky.|Really lucky.
{84236}{84274}Fuck!
{84275}{84315}No dice?
{84317}{84359}- No. But I can get it out.|- How ?
{84360}{84438}A general anesthetic,|a cranial drill and a pair of torceps.
{84439}{84489}I could die, right?
{84491}{84530}It's gonna kill you anyway.
{84532}{84651}If I take it out, you'll probably|survive but lose some fine motor skills.
{84652}{84722}You might not remember anything|for more than three minutes.
{84724}{84784}Fuck that!
{84786}{84870}Let me tell you|what you've got in there...
{84872}{84947}and what it's worth to the world!
{84949}{85004}You're carrying|the cure for NAS.
{85047}{85094}You're telling me I got--
{85095}{85181}PharmaKom's R&D on their cure|for Nerve Attenuation Syndrome.
{85183}{85297}Plus the field trials to prove|that it works-- and it really works.
{85318}{85364}You mean, like a real cure?
{85366}{85428}They could have you straightened out|in three weeks.
{85430}{85497}You and everybody else.
{85499}{85551}Everybody's trying|to cut off my head.
{85553}{85650}So Saigon can run it through|a quantum interference detector.
{85652}{85703}Then they would have the cure.|We wouldn't.
{85703}{85760}You keep that thing in your head|and nobody can save you.
{85760}{85826}Plus, the cure is gone forever.
{85828}{85874}I can save the cure.
{85876}{85967}Even with the code, the seepage is so|bad it'd probably come out as garbage.
{85969}{86049}What's it supposed to matter to me|if I'm dead? Follow me?
{86050}{86167}The cure can save millions. You're gonna|die anyway if we don't get it out.
{86233}{86352}All I know is that whatever's|in my head is worth a lot of money.
{86354}{86390}Why should I trust you?
{86392}{86451}You're supposed to be my bodyguard.
{86485}{86508}Bodyguard!
{86509}{86571}You're not walking out|with that cure in your head!
{86678}{86729}That cure is mine!
{86827}{86868}Behold your savior!
{87284}{87353}Get out of the building!|It's your only chance!
{87362}{87410}Go! Get him to Jones!
{87461}{87496}Go!
{87583}{87629}Who is Jones?
{87631}{87713}He's that guy|who fucks your mother.
{88013}{88053}Where are they?
{88406}{88459}I couldn't make the meeting,|but I'm still up for it.
{88459}{88537}- Are you?|- Certainly.
{88539}{88629}This time: on the bridge,|landfill five.
{88631}{88690}Bring the rest of the code.|I'll find you.
{88690}{88728}I'll be there.
{88730}{88782}I want to negotiate.
{88784}{88838}Yes, sir.
{88867}{88938}Great. If they don't kill you,|J-Bone will.
{89133}{89171}Listen to me before it's too late.
{89173}{89243}We're running out of time.|He's carrying the cure for--
{90139}{90209}I told her|if she wants to get with me...
{90210}{90258}then I want to get with her.
{90259}{90339}Screw the physical disability.
{90341}{90390}Because it's about the feeling.
{90433}{90469}What's up?
{90495}{90542}Wind, maybe.
{90750}{90780}What do you think?
{90782}{90840}It's crazy,|but if I really have the cure...
{90840}{90893}it could save you.
{90933}{90979}It could save everybody.
{91174}{91260}Who is this Jones guy|Spider said was our only chance?
{91293}{91328}He's--
{91386}{91426}He was in the navy.
{91428}{91458}In the war.
{91460}{91529}They put a lot of stuff in his head.|Kind of like you.
{91531}{91579}Memory augments?
{91581}{91627}I don't know.
{91659}{91697}You'll see.
{91847}{91937}Man, somebody crazy down there|is getting on my nerves.
{91939}{92017}Ratlands are full of crazies, Stick.|Ignore it, man.
{92057}{92098}No, man.
{92121}{92149}Down there.
{92151}{92208}It's Spider's van.
{92210}{92284}Yep. Better tell J-Bone.
{92286}{92338}I got an idea.
{92340}{92399}Let's drop a bug on Spider man.
{92401}{92453}Forget it.
{92455}{92485}I'm going to do it.
{92486}{92555}Don't say that.|J-Bone'll shit if he hears you.
{92556}{92584}I'm going to do it.
{92586}{92656}Wake up, damn it!
{92658}{92721}- Shit, man.|- That's what they're for.
{92885}{92914}Shit!
{93292}{93338}What the fuck is going on?
{93514}{93620}You know, all my life...
{93621}{93713}I've been careful to|stay in my own corner.
{93715}{93749}Looking out for number one.
{93750}{93807}No complications.
{93837}{93886}Now suddenly...
{93888}{93976}I'm responsible|for the entire fucking world!
{93977}{94045}Everybody and his mother|is trying to kill me...
{94047}{94130}if my head doesn't blow up first.
{94132}{94197}Maybe it's not just about you anymore.
{94266}{94334}Listen. You listen to me.
{94361}{94425}You see that city over there?
{94427}{94490}That's where I'm supposed to be.
{94492}{94549}Not down here with the dogs|and the garbage...
{94549}{94641}and the fucking last month's newspapers|blowing back and forth!
{94662}{94717}I've had it with them!
{94719}{94800}I've had it with you and all this!
{94856}{94944}I want room service!
{95011}{95104}I want the club sandwich|and the cold Mexican beer.
{95106}{95167}I want a $10,000-a-night hooker!
{95329}{95376}I want my shirts laundered...
{95442}{95547}Like they do at the Imperial Hotel...
{95615}{95650}in Tokyo.
{96650}{96695}We've got to see Jones.
{96722}{96762}Spider sent us.
{96764}{96823}Where's Spider?
{96825}{96860}He's dead.
{96881}{96932}Not in there. Earlier.
{96934}{96970}At the hospital.
{97089}{97136}If Spider sent you, come on.
{97314}{97347}J-Bone, help me.
{97349}{97394}Come on.|Keep it together.
{97463}{97497}Come on.
{97987}{98039}Help. Right here. You too.
{98115}{98150}I got him!
{98198}{98259}He'll be all right.|Go on.
{98998}{99051}Tell Shinji to meet me at the bridge.
{99052}{99094}He's on his way, sir.
{99127}{99182}- My helicopter.|- It's waiting, sir.
{99896}{99918}You okay?
{99956}{100002}I saw--
{100004}{100035}I almost saw--
{100074}{100121}As if it was...
{100162}{100199}a memory.
{100493}{100558}We have a room especially for that.
{100603}{100649}It's time to meet Jones.
{100925}{101003}We built Heaven completely|out of straight-world junk...
{101005}{101052}all hauled up here piece by piece.
{101082}{101125}We work for Spider and his people...
{101126}{101191}and anybody else|who is fighting the system.
{101193}{101239}We out shit for them.
{101263}{101312}What do you mean, "out"?
{101523}{101546}Heaven.
{101547}{101595}The heart and soul.
{101840}{101882}This is where we tight back.
{101883}{101961}We strip the pictures|from their 500-channel universe.
{101963}{102027}Recontextualize it.|Then we spit the shit back at them.
{102055}{102087}Special data.
{102089}{102113}Things that'll help people...
{102115}{102170}Like stuff we get from Spider.
{102172}{102216}We wide-band it.
{102218}{102276}Broadcast it. Go global.
{102278}{102351}Bounce it off the satellites|that Jones hacks for us.
{102353}{102385}Way the navy got him hooked up...
{102387}{102457}he cuts through hard encryption|like a knife through butter.
{102458}{102532}Code breaker.|I can't wait to meet him.
{102534}{102572}Right this way.
{102688}{102722}Jones.
{102853}{102891}It's a fish.
{102992}{103016}It's a mammal.
{103078}{103135}He's a friend, sailor.
{103196}{103253}This was Spider's best bet?
{103254}{103347}One thing Spider wasn't was stupid.
{103349}{103442}Jones is set up to sample software|from enemy subs.
{103443}{103494}Intra-sound scan.
{103496}{103541}Right through the hull.
{104382}{104441}Jones'll feed you can opener codes.
{104443}{104478}We'll try to get you out in time.
{104480}{104549}Wait. Have you done this before?
{104551}{104611}Has the fish?
{104666}{104697}How dangerous is this?
{104699}{104745}Just keep your head still.
{104747}{104793}Move around too much...
{104795}{104839}could microwave your frontal lobe.
{104938}{104969}Forget it.
{104971}{105066}Look, man, at least you got a chance.
{105068}{105128}It's up to you.
{105129}{105175}Do what you got to do.
{105500}{105556}Give me what you got|of the download codes.
{106557}{106606}Inputting first image.
{106608}{106658}Set up the broadcast antennas.
{107111}{107141}Now.
{107545}{107609}It wasn't my fault.
{107611}{107643}We were just fooling around.
{107645}{107719}I just don't want to do nothing no more.
{107761}{107809}Hear what I'm saying?
{107811}{107842}Hey, buddy.
{108303}{108337}Maroni!
{108664}{108699}Motherfuckers!
{108879}{108923}Stations! You all know the drill!
{109364}{109410}- What did you get?|- We didn't.
{109458}{109498}We're not going to get it right now.
{109540}{109632}The only way is to hack your own brain|and loop it through Jones.
{109634}{109677}The fuel tanks!
{109727}{109765}Shit. It's the Yakuza.
{109801}{109833}Give me that.
{110621}{110662}I was almost there.
{110663}{110725}I could feel it starting to--
{110889}{110935}Mr. Smith?
{110969}{111004}PharmaKom?
{111050}{111083}Not really.
{111289}{111327}You can't shoot me.
{111363}{111411}Not in the head.
{111719}{111769}Takahashi!
{111771}{111842}Do you know what|he is carrying in his head?
{111844}{111941}He's carrying the cure for NAS.
{111942}{112050}Your daughter died to protect|PharmaKom's profit margin.
{112052}{112162}Treating the disease is far more|profitable than curing it.
{112164}{112201}They had the cure...
{112203}{112247}eight months ago, Takahashi.
{112249}{112356}PharmaKom, the company that I created...
{112357}{112414}Let your daughter die.
{112879}{112915}Shinji.
{113027}{113061}Hello, Johnny.
{113270}{113310}Raise your chin.
{113312}{113358}Let's make this clean.
{114799}{114829}Kiai !
{115238}{115289}If I fall, you don't get the head.
{115290}{115347}If you lose the head,|you're fucked!
{116672}{116707}Jesus time.
{118368}{118407}Come to Jesus.
{118738}{118767}The cure.
{118919}{119025}He's made you the vessel of His mercy|as I am the vessel of His wrath.
{119054}{119079}Jones.
{119202}{119246}What spawn of Satan--
{119338}{119359}Now!
{120540}{120569}Jane!
{120765}{120792}I'm all right.
{121074}{121110}Piece of shit.
{121136}{121172}Hook me up.
{121174}{121217}The second image.
{121273}{121314}Get the power up!
{121765}{121792}Johnny.
{121837}{121911}The dolphin can take you into the data.
{121913}{121961}Find the third image.
{122008}{122077}I knew their secrets.
{122078}{122139}The image...
{122141}{122230}the company has forgotten for me.
{122232}{122290}Now they erase me...
{122291}{122346}burn me out of the mainframes.
{122347}{122429}One memory after another.
{122431}{122515}How very kind of them.
{122538}{122563}Johnny.
{122675}{122758}We're out of power,|so we have to do the download now.
{122926}{122997}Remember, we've got to|loop it through Jones.
{123076}{123115}Okay, let's do this.
{123117}{123161}Watch your ass, man.
{123162}{123246}No telling what defenses|PharmaKom stuck in there.
{123248}{123296}Probably got virus programs.
{123298}{123346}You ready?
{123348}{123384}Loop it.
{123906}{123941}Listen up, world.
{123943}{124006}This is the last blast|from LoTek World Headquarters.
{124008}{124060}And believe this:|We're going out with a bang, baby.
{124060}{124122}So get your VCRs ready,|'cause we got what you need.
{124122}{124179}We got the cure to NAS.
{124181}{124234}That's right.|The cure to the black shakes.
{124234}{124295}It's coming to you live|from the labs up at PharmaKom.
{124297}{124379}And believe this: They did not want you|to get this information.
{124381}{124446}So here it is, coming at you,|LoTek style.
{124607}{124641}Hit me.
{124870}{124906}He's on his way in.
{125270}{125323}Unauthorized interface attempt.
{125425}{125487}Intruder alert.
{125710}{125766}Final warning.
{125768}{125826}Initiating virus program.
{126059}{126095}He's doubling himself.
{126193}{126227}Launching virus.
{126474}{126514}That's the double. Don't worry.
{126756}{126800}The only way is to hack your own brain.
{127100}{127125}Loop it.
{127574}{127620}Get ready.
{127622}{127652}Send it out.
{127829}{127858}Initiating download.
{129796}{129855}Happy birthday, Johnny.
{129882}{129925}Thank you, Mommy.
{131344}{131390}It's payback time.
{131802}{131849}Just garbage.
{131851}{131898}Get that out of here!
We interrupt this program for a breaking news bulletin.
90 miles and counting-- that's how far officers-- of the Nevada highway patrol have pursued the blue car on your screen.
In a wild chase right through the heart of Elko at speeds approaching 100 miles an hour.
Live on the scene in Carlin is
Chuck Pickering in the Fox 11 news chopper.
Chuck, what can you tell us?
Benjamin, we're heading west following route 766, where it feeds off the I-80.
Now, just under an hour ago, troopers attempted to pull over the blue car-- which we understand is stolen.
That occurred on the 80, east of Wells.
Now, since then, this driver has stopped for nothing and nobody.
Any word yet on who the driver is?
None at this time.
What we do think, though and what we've passed on to the Highway Patrol-- is that from our vantage point we've seen another person in that car.
See, right there.
A hand.
It just moved.
See, in the back seat?
Now, we could possibly have a hostage situation here.
And, obviously, the sooner they bring this vehicle to a stop...
Unit six, ready at milepost 13.
Coming your way, six.
Well, that did the trick.
The automobile seems to be coming to a stop.
Chuck, what did they just use there?
It looked to be a special tire-puncturing chain.
And now the officers are approaching the car.
One of them has opened the door, and he has hold of the suspect.
He's pulling him out.
He doesn't seem to have a weapon.
He may not be armed but from our vantage point, it looks like he doesn't want to get out of that car.
Vicky!
Vicky!
Please get it out of my head.
Vicky! Vicky!
No! Let me go!
Let me go! Vicky!
No! Let me go!
I got to go!
Vicky! No!
...Hostage appears to be okay.
The Highway Patrol has her now.
But Chuck, it looks like that driver is still fighting.
Yes.
He's definitely putting up a bit of a fight.
He seems to be a man with a few choice words on the subject as you can see.
They're trying to restrain him.
I tell you what.
We're going to move back and try to get a wider angle.
See, there's the woman...
What the hell?
She's...
Vicky! Vicky!
There, see?
She's banging her head against the window.
- What the hell just happened?
- CUT! CUT! CUT!
Yeah?
Uh, Virgil Nokes?
I'm Agent Scully.
This is Agent Mulder.
We're with the F.B.I.
Jehovah's Witness?
No, sir.
Federal Bureau of Investigation.
But we do have a free copy of "The Watchtower" for you if you'd like.
Uh, sir, this is just a routine check but, uh, we understand that you recently placedan order for...
5,000 pounds of ammonium nitrate fertilizer.
Oh, you people.
Come on in.
- Sugar beets.
- Excuse me?
I grow sugar beets.
I figure I got better things to do with my fertilizer than going... around blowing government buildings sky high.
Yeah. Well, as we said, sir this is just routine.
So routine, it numbs the mind.
I got my AG card and my papers
'round here somewhere.
Help me look for them, will you?
...As we reported earlier a wild police pursuit... ended in tragedy this morning with the death of a 36-year-old female hostage.
This was the scene west of Elko,
Nevada, one hour ago...
- Hey, Scully, take a look at this.
- ...died mysteriously while in custody.
We once again want to warn our viewers this footage is extremely graphic.
Now the hostage is still inside the car.
It appears that she is banging her head against the window...
At this time, highway patrol officials are refusing... to identify the woman or to speculate on how she died.
Though they do stress it was not the result of a gunshot.
A preliminary Coroner's report is not expected for a day or more.
Meanwhile residents of
Northern Nevada who first witnessed...
Thank you, Captain. That's no problem.
We'd be happy to help.
- Mm-hmm.
- We'll be happy to help what?
See you soon.
Mulder, we're not going to Nevada.
Come on, Scully.
Just one quick side trip.
No. Sorry, Mulder.
We have a whole new assignment.
Running down people that buy fertilizer?
This is scut work, bozo work--
This is the F.B.I. equivalent of being made to wear an orange jumpsuit... and pick up trash by the side of the highway-- they mean to humiliate us.
Look, Mulder, like it or not, humiliated or not, we're on domestic terrorism now and, yes, this is...
This is a punishment... but if we want to get back to where we want to be we have to follow orders.
We can't freelance.
You saw that news report.
What did you make of that?
I think that the obvious assumption is that the woman was shot, regardless of what the police say.
Maybe it was a sniper.
In the words of their captain
"she just sort of popped."
And what about this guy who supposedly tried to take her hostage, her husband?
Looked to me like he was trying to warn the cops before she died.
Now, the sun will rise in America tomorrow regardless of whether... or not we're at yet another farm investigating yet another enormous pile of doo-doo.
We can be in and out in a day.
Nobody has to know.
S-s-somebody!
Please!
It's starting!
Somebody!
Why can't we see him?
Well, hopefully later.
He pitched quite a fit in his cell-- screaming a bunch of nonsense that we were going to kill him the way we killed his wife.
You know, he's not a particularly stable individual.
Captain, he may need medical attention.
He's getting it.
Our doctor's with him now.
I mean, after whatever happened to his wife-- which I'd like to stress was not our fault-- we're not going to take any chances, you know?
Patrick Garland Crump of Montello, Nevada.
40-year-old roofer.
No history of mental illness.
No prior record.
He's got one now.
That Barracuda he jacked on the Utah state line?
He yanked some teenager out of the window threw his wife in back and took off.
Excuse me.
What do you think?
I'm thinking while we're here
I might take a look at Mr. Crump's wife.
I'm going to stay here and see if I can see Crump.
Captain, where's Montello?
Little town right here.
So that's where it started.
That's Crump's home.
Then he headed east in this direction... on the 5 about ten miles to the Utah border where he stole the car.
You got it.
Yeah, but you caught up with him in Wells. Where's that?
- That's here.
- So that means that he started... off in this direction. Then all of a sudden, he turned around and he headed west...
To Wells. Why?
The former Vicky Jenkins Crump.
I'm hoping you can tell me what I'm looking at 'cause this is a new one on me.
There's no gunpowder residue...
No carbon stippling.
There seems to be no evidence of an entry wound whatsoever.
There is none.
It's all exit, but how that could be...?
I'm finding what look like fragments of petrous bone embedded... in the remaining portion of the auditory canal.
In fact, I seem to be looking straight through to the osseous labyrinth or what's left of it.
It's almost like a little bomb went off in her ear.
- May I?
- Please.
There seems to be some kind of tumefaction within the lateral sinus.
Patient is a white male, age 40, no known history...
No, he just went rammy on me.
Accucheck is normal.
We did a narcan push... but he keeps getting worse.
Okay. I.V. beta blocker and topical nitro.
I don't know if you're going to get to talk to this fella after all.
Five's a crowd, buddy.
Whoa. Something must have worked.
Heart rate's dropping.
BP's headed south.
I don't understand;  what'd you just do?
Hell if I know but I'll take it.
Oh, God.
Come on, Mulder.
Hey, you, out!
This lab is quarantined. Go!
- Mulder?
- Yeah.
Mulder, it's me.
You know how to pick them, I'll tell you that.
Look, I have no idea what killed this woman but I have to assume it's communicable.
Yeah.
Another body has been found just outside of Montello-- same apparent cause of death-- some kind of massive aneurysm or rupture.
- Uh-huh.
- And Mulder, I've called the C.D.C.
They're on their way but Patrick Crump may be infected.
So you need to quarantine his cell and make sure that anybody... who's had any close contact with him whatsoever has been quarantined as well, and that means you, Mulder.
You're to have no contact with him whatsoever.
Mulder?
Well, that's going to be a little tough, Scully.
Drive.
Where are they?
Route 789, heading west.
We're keeping them in visual plus... we're in phone contact... not to mention the strings we pulled to keep this off local TV.
- Where are they going?
- Crump won't say.
Wherever it is, though, he ain't getting there.
- Roadblock?
- We'll shut him down east of Tuscarora--
- nice, clean, remote space we can own.
- All right.
I want the C.D.C. on-site.
I want the officers making the arrest to be wearing level... two or better anti-contamination suits.
I want the car decontaminated.
I want Agent Mulder and Crump decontaminated.
- I want them quarantined separately.
- You got it.
Crump says that if we don't pull back our escort he's going to shoot your partner.
You just leave me the hell alone!
Now!
How about if we just pull over and let me out, too, huh?
- I must be cramping your style.
- Just... Shut up.
It's you people.
- Figures.
- What figures?
Shut up.
Hey! No!
No!
That is... so stupid, Crump.
- Shut up.
- That is so stupid.
You shut up and drive, you understand?
- What are you doing?
- What? What am I doing?
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm composing a sonnet.
- I'm slowing down for a light.
- Go!
Go!
Crump?
Is this what happened to your wife?
This same thing?
If you stop moving, you die?
I think I saw this movie.
Why didn't you tell anybody?
Why didn't you tell the police?
Oh, geez.
I don't know how well you recall the last 30 seconds... but your life is in my hands regardless of whether or not you hold that gun.
- It's right here, boy.
- Just tell me everything you know.
- That may be the only way I can help you.
- You people put me here!
Shut up.
I'm guessing we got two or three miles before the roadblock.
- What roadblock? I got rid of the cops.
- Check your window.
Oh, God.
Men, if we get stopped...
Subject's turning off 789 about a mile east of your position... and is heading north on a fire road.
Looks like he's going to miss you.
Say what?
- What's the report, Captain?
- They lost them.
They were last seen on a forestry service road.
Trees were too thick.
Our helicopter lost sight of them.
How did Crump know to avoid the roadblock?
That's the question.
I was hoping your Agent Mulder would manage to steer him toward it, but...
Maybe Agent Mulder steered him away from it.
- Why would he do that?
- Maybe he knew something that we don't.
Agent Scully, I've got the cell cultures from the second victim.
Anything?
So far, I'm seeing no evidence of infection in either victim.
So then, we're in the clear?
No, no. Not necessarily.
I mean, something killed these people.
Sorry. Excuse me.
Scully.
Agent Scully?,
Please hold for Assistant Director Kersh.
- Agent Scully.
- Yes, sir.
How is Southern Idaho?
Agent Scully? Southern Idaho?
Think carefully.
Sir, I am not currently in the state of Idaho.
No, you're not.
In the course of prosecuting our assignment in Idaho,
Agent Mulder and I came across a situation in Nevada... which we both strongly felt needed our immediate attention.
I eagerly await your report.
In the meantime, agents of our Las Vegas field office will be available... to assist you in tracking down Agent Mulder.
Thank you, sir.
Oh, Agent Scully...
I think, at this point I want to see him alive even more than you do.
Can I see that for a minute?
This man worked at
Silver State Power reading meters.
Yes.
What if he read the meter at Vicky Crump's place?
Crump?
Crump, what else can you tell me about what's happening to you?
Mr. Crump.
You call me by my last name, you say "mister" in front of it.
- "Mister." I got you.
- Not Crump. Mr. Crump.
I can think of something else
I'd like to call you.
I could put "mister" in front of that, too if you'd like.
You know, what kind of name is Mulder, anyway? What is that, like...
- like, Jewish?
- Excuse me?
Jewish... It is, right?
It's Mr. Mulder to you, you peanut-picking bastard.
Now, Mr. Crump what can you tell me about what's happening to you?
- What?
- You're going...
- The wrong way.
- What do you mean so "The wrong way"?
- Go this... Go this way!
- I can't... I can't go...
I can't go left.
There's only trees there.
Crump.
Crump...
It's west. Huh, west?
You got to head west.
It's just like you did with your wife.
You took her and you headed west.
It's not just motion; it has to be in one direction.
Is that right?
What the hell happened to you?
Okay, I want a thorough search with an eye to the usual disease vectors.
You got it.
I think we're witnessing the same pathology here.
We need to get a blood sample.
Let's go.
Try to hold him still!
Hang on.
Let me sedate him.
One more time.
You woke up this morning... then what?
We have been through this.
You woke up this morning but you didn't go to work. Why?
It was raining. You don't shingle in the rain.
I was up at 6:00, reading the paper.
What was your wife doing?
Cooking, man. Breakfast. She was just putting breakfast on the table when the...
- You looked up.
- I looked up, and I saw that she had this nosebleed she didn't even know she had.
- What caused it?
- What do I... I'm... I'm, like, Quincy?
How the hell should I know what caused it?
It just happened.
Ten, 15 minutes later, she just...
Starts getting sick.
Said she got a headache that just... keeps getting worse and worse.
Then she starts... screaming.
I didn't know what the hell to do.
I just, uh...
I got her in the truck and...
Taking her to the hospital... but then it seemed like the faster we went the better she'd do... but just as soon as
I try to slow down or stop...
I'm sorry about your wife.
Sure, you are...
You and the rest of your Jew F.B.I.
- Crump...
- Oh, yeah.
You think I don't know, huh?
You think I'm just some ignorant pudknocker, don't you?
But I get it, man!
I see what this is!
I am not sick and I do not have the flu.
Vicky and me were just some kind of...
Government guinea pigs.
- You think the government did this to you?
- Hell, yeah. Who else?
You see it all the time on the TV: they're dropping Agent Orange, they're putting radiation in little retarded kids' gonads...
Oh, yeah. You sons of bitches sneaking around my woods at night--
I seen you.
You think I don't know?
Well, on behalf of the international Jewish conspiracy...
I just need to inform you that we're... almost out of gas.
The trailer looks clean-- no readily apparent vectors.
Dogs, housewives...
Whatever this thing is, it doesn't discriminate.
There are zoonotic pathogens which spread among species.
Look at that.
The Crumps have a neighbor.
Hello!
Hello?
Doctor?
Hello?
Hello?
Oh, no. It's...
It's okay, ma'am. It's okay.
- Who are you?
- It's all right. I'm sorry.
Go away! Go away!
It's okay.
It's okay.
Okay, Crump, we got about one more mile.
I'll make it fast.
You ready?
Here goes nothing.
Hey, turn on the pump!
Number four!
Three!
Number three!
Turn it on!
You got to pay before you pump, buddy!
Hey, dammit, that's my car!
Where the hell do you think you're going?
One deaf woman survives unscathed while everything else around her dies.
Why?
What... What are you doing?
The pathology of this thing...
It affects the inner ear... and this area right here is ground zero.
What if what we're looking for is some kind of a sound?
Seriously?
Oh.
Excuse me.
- Scully.
- It's Van Gelder.
Agent, I don't know what the hell your partner's thinking... but not only is he actively evading my officers, now he's stolen a car.
- Come again?
- You heard right.
He left behind a crazy note addressed to you.
- You there?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Read it to me.
"Crump sick; will die if stopped same as wife.
Must head west to keep alive.
No roadblocks!" Exclamation point.
- This make any sense to you?
- Take him at his word.
Let him through.
Let him through?
Look, uh...
No offense, Agent Scully but how 'bout you run that by your superiors 'cause frankly,
I think they'll say different.
I'll take that under advisement.
Agent Scully, again, I got to say
I feel like we got a situation here that...
Faster.
I'm doing 70.
You got to go faster.
It's getting worse.
Okay.
Yeah, yeah.
That's good. Okay.
Hey, uh...
The Jew stuff?
No offense.
I mean, uh...
A man can't help who he's born to.
That was an apology, right?
Gee, I don't know if I can see to drive my eyes are tearing up so bad.
Whatever, man.
Why are you doing this?
- Why am I doing what?
- This.
It's not in your best interest to make me question that right now.
How do I know you ain't doing exactly what they want you to?
Hmm?
Driving me all around creation, experimenting on me... How do I know it ain't that?
I guess you don't.
I ain't saying you are.
I'm just saying...
That's no way to treat a man... take away his dignity like that.
It ain't right.
Better just to kill him.
That's all I'm saying.
Hey, you got to stay alive if you want to stick it to the government.
If you die, you let them off the hook. Am I right?
- Huh?
- You're right. You're damn straight.
We'll figure this out.
You'd better figure quick.
We're running out of west.
Lieutenant Breil?
My name is Dana Scully.
I called in regard to the electrical equipment the Navy is maintaining...
- in the town of Montello.
- Right. Listen, I don't know if there's... been some miscommunication between you and your Washington office, but, uh...
- My Washington office?
- Yeah.
I was under the impression that I'd explained this to the F.C.C.'s satisfaction.
Oh, I'm... I'm so sorry to make you run through it again, uh...
For my official report to the, uh... To the F.C.C.
Okay.
At 6:17 yesterday morning during a test of our ground conduction radio system... a situation arose in which our equipment experienced a brief power surge.
That's what interrupted television reception in the four-state area.
However, steps have already been taken to insure this won't happen again.
The ground conduction radio-- th-that would be Project Seafarer?
The specifics of what we do here are classified, ma'am.
Sure, sure. Um...
Would you happen to know what effect such a surge might have on, uh...
On an organism... Say, a...
Say, a human being?
- Theoretically speaking.
- Theoretically speaking?
Well, that's classified as well, ma'am.
- Crump?
- Mr. Crump.
Mr. Crump...
What is it, Mr. Mulder?
Mulder, are you okay?
Yeah, aside from terminal cell phone withdrawal...
That, and I got to pee.
Where are you?
I'm just about to board a justice department jet...
Hopefully, I'll overshoot you.
- Headed where?
- I don't know, Mulder.  You tell me.
I'm guessing wherever the hell route 36 ends but we can't stop, Scully.
I'm kind of at a loss as to what to do next.
Well, I think I have a loose theory as to what caused this.
- Well, lay it on me.
- Okay.
Mulder, you know what E.L.F. waves are?
Extremely low radio transmissions?
Yeah. It uses an antenna, like, 50 miles long.
The military uses it to communicate with the trident submarines,
Project Seafarer, Project Haarp.
Well, Seafarer has an antenna array stretching beneath the edge of Patrick Crump's property.
Now, ELF fields have been shown to...
To produce biological effects in human tissue... inducing electrical currents, altering chemical reactions.
Not to mention that as a potential weapons application it's been referred to... as "electrical nerve gas" or may be behind the so-called "Taos Hum."
What if some overload some...
Some hum from this system... could somehow match the resonant frequency of the human skull?
I mean, what if it could induce a like hum that could...
That could somehow exert a... a rising pressure on the labyrinth of the inner ear in a sense shattering it?
But with constant movement somehow ameliorating that pressure making it bearable.
- But why only westward movement?
- I don't know, Mulder, I don't know. I mean...
I mean, maybe it has to follow certain lines of force electrical or magnetic.
The big question, Scully, is what do we do about it?
Well, I think I know, Mulder, but it's nothing that Mr. Crump is going to like.
We'll be there.
What?
Well, whether they did this to you intentionally or not, you were right.
They did it to you.
So, what do we... what do we do?
Your one chance is that we meet my partner at the end of the highway.
There, she will insert a long, large-bore needle into your inner ear... hopefully relieving the pressure.
Now, when we get there she's going to have to work fast.
She's only going to have one chance.
She's not going to be able to use any anesthetic... and it will probably leave you deaf.
But I'll live, right?
Well, that's what it's all about.
All right, man. Let's do it.
Mr. Mulder, could you go a little faster, please?
- Just a little more is all I need.
- Sure.
Just a little bit faster.
Get ready!
"Justice department jet: 2.6 turbine hours round trip at $1,400 an hour.
Car rental-- over-mileage, out-of-state use penalties: $346.
Compensation to one Walter R. Duncan... for unauthorized use of his 1968 Caprice station wagon: $500."
Why don't you bill me?
I'll bill your partner instead.
You too obviously relish the role of martyr.
Okay. So are we done here?
Back to the bozo work investigating huge piles of manure?
You can always quit.
- Sir, Agent Mulder has been through a lot.
- And you apologize for him a lot.
- I've noticed that about you.
- I'm not apologizing for this.
Because of his work, the D.O.D. is shutting down their antenna array in northeastern Nevada.
Our participation in this case has saved lives.
I don't see you proving that.
The Department of Defense admits no culpability whatsoever.
Furthermore, they say the closing of the facility was coincidental.
Right.
Don't misunderstand me, Agent.
I don't care if you and your partner saved a school bus... full of doe-eyed urchins on their way to Sunday bible camp.
You no longer investigate X-Files.
You are done... and the sooner you and Mulder come to recognize that, the better for both of you.
Big piles of manure.
3 billion human lives ended on August 29th, 1997.
The survivors of the nuclear fire called the war Judgment Day.
They lived only to face a new nightmare, the war against the machines.
The computer which controlled the machines, Skynet, sent two terminators back through time.
Their mission: To destroy the leader of the human resistance:
John Connor. My son.
The first terminator was programmed to strike at me, in the year 1984, before John was born.
It failed.
The second was set to strike at John himself, when he was still a child.
As before, the Resistance was able to send a lone warrior.
A protector for John.
It was just a question of which one of them would reach him first.
I need your clothes, your boots, and your motorcycle.
You forgot to say 'please'.
Take it.
You can't leave and take the man's wheels, son.
Now get off before I put you down.
That's it, goddammit!
Art 31 David show me code 6 at the 6th street bridge in Santa Fé on an electrical disturbance.
10-4, 31 David.
John! Get in there and clean up that pigsty of yours.
Your foster-parents are kinda dicks, huh?
I swear I've had it with that goddamn kid.
Won't even answer me anymore.
- Honey, move!
Would you get off your butt and help me?
Todd.
- What?
He hasn't cleaned that room of his in a month.
Oh, it's an emergency.
Hang on, I'll get right on it.
John! Come on get your ass inside, do what your mother tells you!
She's not my mother, Todd!
This next patient is interesting.
Been following the case for years.
29-year-old female...
...diagnosed as acute schizo-affective disorder.
Depression, anxiety, violent acting-out, delusions of persecution.
The delusional architecture is fairly unique.
She believes in a machine called a "terminator", which looks human of course, was sent back through time to kill her.
That's original!
And also that the father of her child was a soldier, sent back to protect her.
- No.
He was from the future too.
The year 2029, if I remember correctly.
Here we are.
Morning, Sarah.
Good morning, Dr. Silberman.
How's the knee?
Fine, Sarah.
She stabbed me in the kneecap with my pen a few weeks ago.
Repeated escape attempts.
Let's move on, shall we?
I don't like to see the patients disrupting their rooms.
See that she takes her Thorazine.
- I'll take care of it.
Time to take you meds, Connor.
You take it.
You gotta be good.
You're up for review this afternoon.
I'm not taking it.
I don't want any trouble.
- Ain't no trouble...
Yeah, zap her.
Last call, sugar.
Sweet dreams.
Are you the legal guardian of John Connor?
That's right.
What's he done now?
Could I speak with him, please?
Could if he was here.
He took off on his bike.
So he could be anywhere.
Do you have a photo of John?
Yeah, sure, hold on.
You gonna tell me what this is about?
I just need to ask him a few questions.
He's a good looking boy.
Mind if I keep this picture?
- No, go on.
There was a guy here looking for him too.
Big guy on a bike. Has that got something to do with this?
No. I wouldn't worry about him.
Thanks for your cooperation.
Please insert your stolen card now!
PIN number...
Hurry up, this is taking too long!
Go baby, go baby...
Alright! PIN number...
Who did you learn this from?
- My mom.
My real mom, I mean.
Withdraw 300 bucks.
Come on, baby, come on...
It worked!
Easy money! Come on!
Yeah!
- Piece of cake!
That her?
Yes.
So she's pretty cool, huh?
- No, she's a complete psycho.
That's why she's up at Pescadero, the mental institute.
Tried to blow up the computer factory, but got shot and arrested.
- Oh shit.
She's a total loser.
Come on, let's go spend some money!
Sarah.
Sarah, wake up.
Kyle?
You're dead.
Where's our son, Sarah?
They took him away from me.
He's the target now.
- I know!
He's alone.
You have to protect him.
I know.
You tell me how I am supposed to do that.
He doesn't even believe me anymore.
I've lost him.
You're strong, Sarah.
Stronger than you ever thought.
- No.
On your feet, soldier!
I love you. I always will.
I need you.
- I'll always be with you.
Remember the message?
"The future is not set.
There is no fate but what we make for ourselves."
Stay with me.
There's not much time left in the world, Sarah.
Kyle, don't go!
Kyle!
It's like a giant strobe light, burning right to my eyes.
Somehow I can still see.
Look, we know the dream's the same every night, why do we have to...
Please continue.
The children look like burnt paper, black, not moving.
Then the blast wave hits them...
...and they fly apart like leaves.
Dreams about the end of the world are very common, Sarah.
It's not a dream, you moron.
It's real.
I know the date it happens!
- I'm sure it feels real to you.
On August 29th, 1997 it's going to feel pretty fucking real to you too!
Anybody not wearing two million sunblock is gonna have a real bad day, get it?
God, you think you're safe and alive.
You're already dead. Everybody, him, you, you're dead already!
This place, everything you see, is gone.
You're the one living in a fucking dream, Silberman!
Because I know it happens.
It happens!
I feel much better now.
Clearer.
Yes. Your attitude has been much improved lately.
It has helped to have a goal, something to look forward to.
And what is that?
You said that if I showed improvement after six months, you would transfer me to the minimum security wing and I could have visitors.
Well, it's been six months.
I was looking forward to seeing my son.
I see.
Let's go back to what you were saying about those terminator machines.
Now you think they don't exist?
They don't exist.
I know that now.
But you've told me on many occasions about how you crushed one in a hydraulic press.
If I had, there would have been some evidence.
They would've found something at the factory.
I see.
So you don't believe anymore that the company covered it up?
No, why would they?
Let's try a new position.
Right, there.
The neuronal sensors are correct, because it works.
The neurons are all centered.
Maybe the inhibitors failed.
Mr. Dyson?
The materials team...
...is running another series this afternoon, and you have to...
You have to sign it out.
Come on. I'll get it.
I know I haven't been here that long, but I was wondering if you know...
Know what?
Well if you know, where it came from.
I asked the same question once.
Know what they told me?
"Don't ask."
Hello, Mr. Dyson. - How's it going?
- Okay.
Insert key.
Left and three, two, one, turn.
How are wife and kids?
- Great, thanks.
So what do you think, Doctor?
I've shown improvement, haven't I?
Well, Sarah, here's the problem:
I know how smart you are.
You're just telling me what I want to hear.
I don't think you believe what you're telling me.
If I put you in minimum security you'll just try to escape again.
You have to let me see my son.
Please.
Please.
He's in great danger.
He's naked without me.
If I could just make a phone call.
- I'm afraid not. Not for a while.
I don't see any choice but to recommend to the review board that you stay here for another six months.
You son of a bitch!
You don't know what you're doing!
- Straighten her now!
You don't know what you're doing!
Model citizen.
You just missed him.
He left fifteen minutes ago.
I think he said he was going to the Galleria. - Yeah.
The Galleria?
I'll get some quarters.
I'll be back, alright?
Girls, do you know John Connor?
- No.
You know this guy?
No, I don't know him.
John.
- Not now.
There's this cop scoping for you, check it out.
Split, man, just go.
- Yeah.
I think I saw the kid you're looking for.
You're not supposed to be here!
Get down!
Come on!
Goddamn!
Okay, time out. Stop the bike!
Come on, stop the bike.
Don't take this the wrong way, you're a terminator, right?
Yes. Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.
Holy shit! You're really real!
You're like a machine underneath, but sort of alive outside?
I'm a cybernetic organism.
Living tissue over a metal endoskeleton.
This is intense.
Get a grip, John.
You're not here to kill me.
I figured that out for myself.
So what's the deal?
My mission is to protect you.
Yeah? Who sent you?
You did.
35 years from now you reprogrammed me to be your protector here, in this time.
This is deep.
This other guy, he's a terminator like you, right?
Not like me. A T-1000.
Advanced prototype.
You mean more advanced than you are?
Yes. A mimetic polyalloy.
What does that mean?
Liquid metal.
Where are we going?
- We have to get out of the city.
And avoid the authorities.
I gotta stop by my house and pick up some stuff. - Negative.
The T-1000 will definitely try to reacquire you there.
You sure?
- I would.
Look, Todd and Janelle are dicks but I gotta warn them.
Shit! You got a quarter?
Hello?
Janelle? It's me.
John?
- Yeah.
Is everything alright?
- Sure.
Are you alright?
- I'm fine.
John, it's late. I was beginning to worry about you.
If you hurry, we can have dinner together. I'm making beef stew.
Something's wrong.
She's never this nice.
Where are you?
What's the goddamn dog barking at?
Shut up, you piece of shit!
The dog's barking.
Tell the kid to get rid of that mutt.
Honey, it's late.
Could it already be there?
Are you okay?
I'm right here. I'm fine.
- Are you sure?
What's the dog's name?
- Max.
Janelle, what's wrong with Wolfy?
I can hear him barking.
Is he okay?
Wolfy's fine, honey.
Where are you?
Your foster-parents are dead.
I need a minute here.
You're telling me that this thing can imitate anything it touches?
Anything it samples by physical contact.
Can't be real!
It could disguise itself as a pack of cigarettes?
Only objects of equal size.
Why not a bomb or something to get me?
It can't form complex machines.
Guns, explosives have chemicals, moving parts.
It doesn't work that way.
But it can form solid metal shapes.
Like what?
- Knives and stabbing weapons.
These were taken by a video surveillance camera at the West Highland police station in 1984.
He killed 17 police officers that night.
Men with families.
Children.
These were taken at a mall in Reseda. Today.
Ms Connor, we know you know who this guy is.
Look, I just sat here and told you your son is missing, that the foster-parents have been murdered.
We know this guy's involved.
Doesn't that mean anything to you?
Don't you care?
We're wasting our time.
Let's go.
Sorry, guys. She's just grown more and more disconnected from reality as time goes on.
I'm afraid she can't help us now.
If she clears at all and can give us anything, I'll call you. - Sure.
Douglas, take her back to her room, please. - Yes, sir.
Come on, let's go.
We spent a lot of time in Nicaragua and places like that.
For a while she was with this crazy ex-Green Beret guy, running guns.
Then there were some other guys.
She'd shack up with anybody she could learn from, so she could teach me how to be this great military leader.
Then she gets busted and it's like:
"Sorry kid, your mom's a psycho.
Didn't you know?"
Everything I've been brought up to believe is all bullshit.
I hated her for that.
But everything she said was true.
She knew.
And nobody believed her.
Not even me.
We gotta get her out of there.
- Negative.
The T-1000's highest probability for success will be to copy her and wait for you to make contact.
Great. What happens to her?
The subject being copied is terminated.
Why didn't you tell me?
We gotta go now!
Negative.
It's not a priority.
Fuck you, she's a priority to me!
Goddammit!
What's your problem?
Help!
- This does not help our mission!
Help me! Get this psycho off of me.
Let me go!
Why did you do that?
Because you told me to.
What?
You have to do what I say?
One of my mission parameters.
Prove it.
Stand on one foot.
Cool! My own terminator.
You okay, kid?
Take a hike, bozo.
Let's get out of here.
- What?
Fuck you, little dipshit.
Dipshit?
Put your leg down.
Did you call moi a dipshit?
Just trying to help this punk.
Grab this guy.
Now who's the dipshit, you jock douchebag?
Put the gun down! Now!
Get out of here!
Come on, let's split!
You were gonna kill that guy!
Of course. I'm a terminator.
Listen to me carefully, okay?
You're not a terminator anymore. Alright?
You got that?
You just can't go round killing people! - Why?
What do you mean "why"?
'Cause you can't!
Why?
- Because you just can't, okay?
Trust me on this.
Look, I'm gonna go get my mom.
And I order you to help me.
You have a Sarah Connor here?
- You're running kind of late.
They've been in there for an hour.
Hold on a second, I'll buzz you in.
Oh, here come your friends now.
Hey Gwen, you want some coffee?
- No, thanks.
How about a beer?
- Yeah, right.
I got a Full House.
- That's good.
Must be my lucky day.
Yeah, I think you're right about number 24.
Increase the medication to 250 milligrams.
Same time?
- Yeah.
You broke my arm!
There's 215 bones in the human body. That's one.
Now don't move!
What are you gonna do?
Why do we stop now?
You gotta promise you're not gonna kill anyone, right?
Right.
- Swear.
What?
Just put up your hand and say
"I swear I won't kill anyone."
I swear I will not kill anyone.
- Alright, let's go.
Visiting hours is 10 to 4.
Monday through Friday.
What are you doing?
You son of a bitch! You shot me!
He'll live.
Son of a bitch!
Let's all try to remain calm.
- Open it or he'll be dead!
There's no way, Connor. Let him go.
Open the door!
- It ain't gonna happen.
Take it easy, Sarah.
It won't work, Sarah.
You're no killer.
You're already dead, Silberman.
Everybody here dies.
So don't fuck with me!
Open the door.
Back off!
Get back or I'll pump him full of this shit, I swear!
Don't move!
Drop the shit!
Do it! Do it!
Get in the office!
On the floor! Face down! Not you!
Open the door!
On the floor! Hold it open!
Face the wall!
Get her!
Come on, open it!
Come on!
She just broke it off.
- Open it.
Let's go around, come on!
Move it!
No!
No!
Mom! Wait!
No!
Help her.
- Wait here.
He'll kill us all!
He'll kill us all!
Mom, are you okay?
Come with me, if you want to live.
It's okay, Mom.
He's here to help.
Go!
What the fuck is going on?
Get down!
Out of the car!
Right now!
I'm out.
Come on!
- Here.
Reload!
Next one.
Hang on!
Ready!
Here, drive!
There's nobody behind us.
Are you alright?
- Yeah.
Can you even see anything?
I see everything.
Cool.
Come here.
I said I was okay.
John, it was stupid of you to go there.
You have to be smarter than that.
You almost got yourself killed.
What were you thinking?
You cannot risk yourself, even for me, do you understand?
You're too important!
You understand?
I had to get you out of that place. I'm sorry.
I didn't need your help.
I can take care of myself.
What's wrong with your eyes?
Nothing.
So what's your story?
You okay?
- Fine.
Say, that's a nice bike.
Hey, watch it, lug nuts.
Listen, you know what you are doing?
I have detailed files on human anatomy.
- I bet.
Makes you a more efficient killer, right? - Correct.
Does it hurt when you get shot?
I sense injuries. The data could be called pain.
John, help me with the light.
Will these heal up?
- Yes.
Good. If you can't pass for human, you're not much good to us.
How long do you live,
I mean "last", whatever?
120 years with my existing power cell.
Can you learn stuff you haven't been programmed with?
So you can be... you know, more human?
Not such a dork all the time?
My CPU is a neural-net processor, a learning computer, that Skynet presets to READ only when we are sent out alone.
Doesn't want you to do too much thinking.
No.
Can we reset the switch?
Rotate the two locking cylinders counterclockwise.
Do it.
Now open the port cover.
Pull to break the seal.
Good, now remove the shock damping assembly.
You can now access the CPU.
Do you see it?
- Yes.
Pull the CPU by its base tap.
Pull.
Can you see the pin switch?
No!
Out of my way, John!
- Don't kill him!
"It", John, not "him".
Okay, "it". But we need "it".
Listen to me. Listen.
We're better off on our own.
He's the only proof of the future, the war and that.
Maybe.
I don't trust it.
But he's my friend, alright?
You don't know what it's like to kill these things.
If something goes wrong, this could be our last chance.
If I'm supposed to be this military leader, maybe you start listening to my ideas once in a while.
'Cause if my own mother won't, how do you expect anyone else to?
Alright, play it your way.
Was there a problem?
No problem.
None whatsoever.
Are we learning yet?
We have to get as far away from the city as possible.
Just head south.
Keep it under 65.
We don't want to be pulled over.
Affirmative.
No, no, no.
You got to listen to the way people talk.
You don't say "affirmative" or some shit like that.
You say "No problemo".
If someone comes up to you with an attitude, you say "Eat me".
And if you want to shine them on, it's "Hasta la vista, baby".
Hasta la vista, baby.
Or "Later, dickwad".
If someone gets upset you say "Chill out".
Or do combinations.
Chill out, dickwad.
You're getting it.
No problemo.
You got any cash?
- I got a couple of hundred bucks.
I'll give you half.
Mom!
Get some food.
No sense of humor.
And that's another thing:
Lighten up a bit.
This severe routine is getting old.
You're acting like such a geek.
Smile once in a while.
Smile?
Yeah. You know, smile.
Watch.
Hi. Nice place you got here.
How's business?
Gimme a break.
Okay. Bad example.
See that guy over there?
That's a smile.
That's good.
You could practice in front of a mirror or something.
Want some of my fries?
Do you need any help?
No.
Got you!
- No, you didn't!
Got you!
- You didn't!
We're not gonna make it, are we?
People, I mean.
It's in your nature to destroy yourselves.
Yeah. Major drag, huh?
I need to know how Skynet gets built.
Who's responsible?
The man responsible is Miles Bennett Dyson.
Who is that?
The director of special projects at
Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.
Why him?
In a few months he creates a revolutionary microprocessor.
Go on. Then what?
In three years Cyberdyne will become the largest supplier of military computer systems.
Stealth bombers are upgraded with Cyberdyne computers.
Becoming unmanned, they fly with a perfect operational record.
The Skynet funding bill is passed.
The system goes on-line on August 4th, 1997.
Human decisions are removed from strategic defense.
Skynet begins to learn at a geometric rate.
It becomes self-aware at 2: 14 a.m.
Eastern time, August 29.
In a panic, they try to pull the plug.
Skynet fights back.
Yes. It launches its missiles against targets in Russia.
Why Russia?
They're our friends now.
Because Skynet knows that the Russian counterattack will eliminate its enemies here.
- Jesus.
How much do you know about Dyson?
I have detailed files.
I want to know everything.
What he looks like.
Where he lives. Everything.
Miles!
You going to work all day?
- I'm sorry, baby.
This thing is kicking my ass.
It's Sunday. You promised to take the kids to Raging Waters today.
I can't. I'm on a roll.
This is gonna blow 'em away.
It's a neural-net processor.
I know. You told me.
It thinks and learns like we do.
It's superconducting at room temperature.
Other computers are just pocket calculators by comparison.
Why is that so important?
I need to know,
'cause sometimes I feel like
I'm going crazy here.
Baby, I am this close.
Come here.
Imagine a jet airliner with a pilot that never gets tired, never makes mistakes, never shows up with a hangover.
Meet the pilot.
Why did we get married?
Have children? You don't need us.
Your heart and your mind are in here.
But it doesn't love you like we do.
I'm sorry. Really.
How about spending some time with your other babies?
Raging Waters?
- Yeah!
Wait in the car.
Enrique?
You here?
Pretty jumpy, Connor.
What about you?
Always on the lurk.
Good to see you, Connor.
- I promised to make it back.
Man, I knew it.
Good to see you.
Yolanda. Get out here, we got company. And bring some tequila!
Oye, Big John?
Que pasa?
- What's up?
Who's your friend?
- He's cool.
He's with me. He is Uncle Bob.
Uncle Bob, this is Enrique.
Uncle Bob, huh?
Okay.
How are you?
How are you? You've gotten big.
Drink?
Uncle Bob?
Sarahlita, you pretty famous.
All over the TV. Pictures of you, John, your big friend here.
Cops are going nuts looking for you.
Take the kid, honey, will you?
I just came for my stuff.
I need clothes, food, and one of your trucks.
How about the fillings out of my fucking teeth? - Now.
You two, you're on weapons detail.
- Come on, let's go.
One thing about my mom, she always plans ahead.
Excellent.
Nothing down here.
This is the best truck I got, but the starter is gone.
You got the time to change it out?
- Yeah.
I'm gonna wait till dark to cross the border.
Enrique, it's dangerous for you here.
You get out tonight too, okay?
- Sure.
Just drop by any time and totally fuck up my life.
See, I grew up in places like this, so I thought that's how people lived:
Riding around in helicopters, learning how to blow shit up.
But then, when my mom got busted,
I got put in a regular school.
The other kids were into Nintendo.
Are you ever afraid?
No.
Not even of dying?
No.
You don't feel any emotion about it one way or another?
No.
I have to stay functional until the mission is complete.
Then it doesn't matter.
Yeah. I have to stay functional too.
I'm "too important".
That's definitely you.
Most of the guys my mom hung round with were geeks.
But there was this one guy.
He was kinda cool.
He taught me engines.
Hold here.
Mom screwed it up, of course.
She'd always tell them about Judgment Day and me being this world leader.
And that'll be all she wrote.
Torque wrench, please.
- Here.
I wish I could've met my real dad.
You will.
Yeah. I guess.
When I'm, like, 45, I think.
I'll send him back through time to 1984.
He hasn't even been born yet.
It messes with your head.
The other bolt.
Here.
Mom and him were only together one night.
She still loves him, I guess.
I see her crying sometimes.
She denies it totally, of course.
Like she got something stuck in her eye.
Why do you cry?
You mean people?
- Yeah.
I don't know.
We just cry, you know.
When it hurts.
Pain causes it?
No, it's different.
It's when there's nothing wrong but you hurt anyway.
You get it?
- No.
Alright! My man!
No problemo.
Gimme five.
Put out your hand like this.
Come on.
Alright. Now hit me.
Gimme five. Do the same thing.
- Alright!
Okay, that's good.
Up high, up high.
Five low.
Too slow.
Just kidding.
One more time.
Watching John with the machine, it was suddenly so clear.
The Terminator would never stop, it would never leave him, never hurt him, never shout at him or get drunk and hit him, or say it was too busy to spend time with him.
It would always be there.
And it would die to protect him.
Of all the would-be fathers who came and went, this thing, this machine, was the only one who measured up.
In an insane world, it was the sanest choice.
She said you go south with him.
She'll meet you tomorrow.
- Mom!
Mom! Wait!
"No fate."
No fate but what we make.
My father told her this.
I mean, I made him memorize it, up in the future, as a message to her.
Never mind.
Now okay, the whole thing goes:
"The future is not set.
There is no fate but what we make for ourselves."
She intends to change the future.
Yeah, I guess.
Oh shit!
Dyson.
Yeah, gotta be!
Miles Dyson!
She's gonna blow him away!
Come on! Let's go!
This is tactically dangerous.
- Drive faster.
The T-1000 has the same files that I do.
It knows what I know.
It might anticipate this move.
I don't care. We've gotta stop her.
Killing Dyson might actually prevent the war. - I don't care!
Haven't you learnt anything yet?
Why you can't kill people?
Look, maybe you don't care if you live or die.
But everybody's not like that!
We have feelings.
We hurt. We're afraid.
You gotta learn this stuff.
I'm not kidding. It's important.
Danny, I told you to go to bed like your sister.
Just a couple of minutes, Mom.
Danny, your time is up.
Come brush your teeth and get to bed.
Danny just go!
Oh my God!
Just take Danny and go. Run!
Oh Jesus, Miles.
Nobody fucking move!
Don't hurt my daddy!
Get on the floor!
Fucking down! Now!
Get out of the way!
Don't hurt him!
Get on the floor! Fast!
Just let the boy go.
Shut up! Shut up!
It's all your fault!
It's all your fault!
- What?
I'm not gonna let you do it.
Shit, we're too late.
Check them.
Look at me, Mom.
Are you hurt?
Look at me.
I almost...
I almost...
It'll by okay.
We'll figure something out, okay?
Promise.
You came here to stop me?
Yes, I did.
I love you, John.
I always have.
I know.
Clean penetration.
No shattered bone.
Hold here. Compression should stop the bleeding.
Who are you?
Show him.
Danny, I want you to come with me.
Show me your room.
Oh, my God!
Now listen to me very carefully.
Dyson listened while the Terminator laid it all down.
Skynet, Judgment Day, the history of things to come.
It's not every day that you find out you're responsible for 3 billion deaths.
He took it pretty well.
I feel like I'm gonna throw up.
You're judging me on things I haven't even done yet.
How were we supposed to know?
Yeah. Right.
How were you supposed to know?
Fucking men like you built the hydrogen bomb.
Men like you thought it up.
You think you're so creative.
You don't know what it's like to create something.
To create a life.
To feel it growing inside you.
All you know how to create is death and destruction. - Mom!
We need to be a little more constructive here, okay?
We still have to stop this from happening.
But I thought...
Aren't we changing things?
Changing the way it goes?
That's right!
There's no way I'm gonna finish the processor. Not now.
Forget it. I'm out of it.
I quit Cyberdyne tomorrow.
- Not good enough.
No one must follow your work.
- Right, then...
We have to destroy the stuff at the lab. The files, drives...
Everything. Everything here.
Everything! I don't care.
Do you know about the chip?
- What chip?
In a vault at Cyberdyne.
From the other one like you.
The CPU from the first terminator.
Son of a bitch, I knew it!
They told us not to ask where they got it.
Those lying motherfuckers!
It was radically advanced.
It was smashed, it didn't work.
But it gave us ideas, took us in new directions.
Things we'd never...
All my work is based on it.
- It must be destroyed.
Can you get us in, past security?
I think so, yeah.
When?
Now?
The future, always so clear to me, had become like a black highway at night.
We were in uncharted territory now, making up history as we went along.
Hi.
Carl, right?
Friends from outta town,
Thought I'd...
...show them around.
You know the rules concerning visitors.
I need authorization...
I insist.
Don't even think about it.
Takes 2 keys to open the vault, turned simultaneously.
The other one is at the security station.
Gibbons.
Come on, man, you can't leave the desk like that.
Oh, shit.
My card should access this.
What is it?
- Dammit.
The silent alarm's been tripped.
It's neutralized all the codes in the building.
Nothing'll open anywhere now.
We have to abort.
No.
We do it all the way! Okay?
You guys get started on the lab.
I can open this.
I think it's that guy from the mall. - It is the guy!
Him and the woman.
Just send everything you've got in the area.
I have a personal entry code for the lab that may still work.
It's no good.
- Let me try mine.
John! Fire-in-the-hole!
Wait! You can't go in there!
The fire's set off the halo system!
You have to wait a few minutes, until the gas clears.
Put this on.
Alright, let's get to work.
All units in the vicinity, all units able to respond:
A 211 in progress at 2144 Kramer
Street, the Cyberdyne building.
Suspect 1 is white, female, identified as: Last name Connor, first name Sarah, escaped from
Pescadero State Hospital.
Suspect 2: White, male...
All the disks in my office. All the disks in that office over there.
Everything behind my desk.
All the processors on my left.
We'll blow it up with the CP4.
Could I...
Excuse me...
Could I borrow that thing?
I worked a lot of years on this thing.
Give me that location again.
- 2111, Kramer.
The suspects are armed and considered extremely dangerous.
Alright,
Yes!
Easy money.
Oh, shit.
Not good. Not good.
How we doing?
- Primal cord is set.
One more barrel, two more minutes.
How do we set them off?
- Remote control.
Piece of cake.
We got company.
- Police?
How many?
- All of them, I think.
Go! I'll finish here.
I'll take care of the police.
- Wait, you swore...
Trust me.
Hey you at the window, drop your weapon and place your hands on top of your head.
That's a damn mini-gun!
Come on! Go!
Go! Go!
Fire!
We go the same time to the left.
One, two, three, go!
Alright.
In order to get that out, you...
We got Skynet by the balls now, don't we? Come on, let's book!
Hold your fire!
Ready to rock?
- Ready.
Time to go. Now.
Take this. They'll use gas.
Get started on the door.
Miles, hand me the detonator.
Mom! Mom!
Shit! She's in the clean room.
There's no way out of there.
Get down!
Here.
I don't know how much longer
I can hold this.
Fall back!
Everybody out!
Move it! Now! Go!
We have a war zone here.
Shut your eyes.
Stay here. I'll be back.
Down on the floor, face down!
On the floor, now!
Okay, drop him!
Here, hold this.
Go!
Get out!
Listen, no matter what happens, you stay under these vests.
You got it?
- Yeah.
Chopper is coming in!
- It's him.
Stay down!
Hello?
Goddamn, you alright?
Come on, Mom, we gotta get out.
Take the shotgun.
- Okay.
Are you hurt?
Holy shit. Come on!
We need your truck.
- Hurry!
Hurry!
- Get in.
What the hell...
I'm bleeding bad!
- Keep pressure on it.
Here, this'll work.
He's gaining!
Step on it!
- This is the vehicle's top speed.
I can get out and run faster than this!
He's coming up, to the right.
Drive a minute.
- Where the hell are you going?
Take the off ramp.
Hold on!
Don't stop!
Go straight!
Get the hell out of here!
Get out of here. Let's go!
Hasta la vista, baby.
We don't have much time.
Let's go!
Come on, we gotta get out of here!
Get up!
Hand me the shotgun.
Put your weight on me, Mom.
Hurry!
Come on, Mom!
Come on, Mom, get up!
This way. Come on!
Wait.
Wait, no, it's too hot.
Go back!
Run!
- No, we stick together.
John, you gotta go now.
Go now!
- No!
Take these steps. Go.
Help me.
- I got you. Come on.
Grab the chain. Grab it!
Grab it! Go!
Mom! Come on!
Call to John.
No.
I know this hurts.
Call John.
Call to John now.
Fuck you.
John! Help!
John!
Help me.
Out of the way, John!
Shoot!
Down!
Get up.
Come on.
Holy shit!
I need a vacation.
Is it dead?
Terminated.
Will this melt in there?
Yes. Throw it in.
Adios.
And the chip.
It's over.
No.
There is one more chip.
And it must be destroyed also.
Here.
I can't self-terminate.
You must lower me into the steel.
No!
I'm sorry, John.
It'll be okay. Stay with us!
I have to go away.
- No don't do it, please don't go.
I must go away, John.
- No.
No, wait.
You don't have to.
Sorry.
No, don't do it, don't go!
It has to end here.
I order you not to go.
I know now why you cry.
But it's something I can never do.
Goodbye.
The unknown future rolls toward us.
I face it for the first time with a sense of hope.
Because if a machine, a terminator, can learn the value of human life, maybe we can too.
There he is! Let's get him.
Come on.
Verifying materialization sequence.
Bring up resolution on radar unit 12.
- Area 7 to Command.
- Go ahead.
We could use another survey team out here, sir.
Base to Ensign McCauley and Ensign Gilles.
Please report to Area 7 and assist the edaphology team.
Acknowledged.
Transferring anthropometric data files to secondary processor.
- Ethnographic studies indicate 97%...
- The ecological analysis...
Still working on correlating that unidentified...
The comparative linguistic analysis is complete, sir.
Admiral Dougherty is waiting for this.
Transmit it to the ship.
Alert! Area 12!
- The android, he's out of control.
- Report.
He's headed toward the village.
We're trying to stop him.
Over there!
Magnify.
Hold your fire.
What is it? What's happening?
Base to Commander Data.
Rerouting micro-hydraulic power distribution.
- Regulating thermal overload.
- Data, report to Base immediately!
Transferring positronic matrix functions.
Engaging secondary protocol.
He's trying to remove the headpiece.
All field units, intercept the android.
Artim, Artim, it's all right.
Get inside. Now.
Find shelter. Everyone, get inside. Now.
Back to your homes! Move it!
Now! Move!
Secondary protocol is active.
- They can see him.
- Stop him! Now!
Commander Data, stand down.
That's an order! I repeat, stand down!
Who are they?
It's an M-Class planet.
Population, 300 million.
- Say the greeting again.
- Yew-cheen chef-faw.
Emphasis on the "cheen" and the "faw."
You either need a new uniform or a new neck.
My collar size is exactly as it was at the Academy.
Of course it is.
Our guests have arrived.
They are eating the floral arrangements on the banquet tables.
I guess they don't believe in cocktails before dinner.
Oh, my God! Are they vegetarian?
That's not in there.
Perhaps we should have the chef whip up a light balsamic vinaigrette, something that goes well with chrysanthemums.
- Bridge to Captain Picard.
- Go ahead, Ensign.
Command wants to know our ETA at the Goren system.
The Goren system?
They need us to mediate some territorial dispute.
No, no.
We can't delay the archeological expedition to Hanoran II.
That'll put us right in the middle of the monsoon season.
- Captain.
- Thank you.
The diplomatic corps is busy with Dominion negotiations.
Yes. So they need us to put out one more brush fire.
Can anyone remember when we used to be explorers?
- Deck 10.
- Yew-cheen chef-faw.
Remember, they have a significantly less advanced technology than ours.
They only achieved warp drive last year.
And the Federation Council decided to make them a protectorate so quickly.
In view of our losses to the Borg and the Dominion, the Council feels we need all the allies we can get these days.
Captain on deck.
You'll be expected to dance with the Regent Cuzar.
- Can she mambo?
- Very funny.
The Captain used to cut quite a rug.
La Forge to Picard.
Captain, I need to talk to you before the reception.
- Captain. Doctor.
- Mr. Worf!
- Worf.
- What the hell are you doing here?
- I was at the Manzar colony...
- He's a little late, Geordi.
- Can it wait?
- I don't think so.
Excuse me.
Tell him that I'm already here, and I'll talk to him when he arrives.
Mr. Worf, I have...
Geordi, the Captain would like you to come up here.
Tell him we've received a communiqué from Admiral Dougherty. It's about Data.
Yew-cheen chef-faw, Regent Cuzar.
Welcome aboard the Enterprise.
Captain Picard, may I welcome you in the time-honored tradition of my people?
We are so honored to be accepted within the great Federation family.
- We have a dance later, I believe.
- I look forward to it.
- Counselor.
- Nice bead work.
Captain. Excuse me. Captain.
Captain, Admiral Dougherty is aboard a Son'a ship in Sector 441.
- He's requesting Data's schematics.
- Is something wrong?
The message doesn't say.
Data should have been back by now.
They were only scheduled to observe the Ba'ku village for one week.
Geordi, would you set up a secure comm link
- with the Admiral in the anteroom?
- Aye, sir.
Captain, Hars Adislo.
We met at the Nel Bato Conference last year.
Did you ever have a chance to read my paper on thermionic transconductance?
Would you excuse me?
He's not acknowledging any Starfleet protocols, not responding to any of our hails.
Have you any idea what precipitated this behavior?
None. Now he's holding our people hostage down there.
Well, the Enterprise could be at your position in two days, Admiral.
That's probably not a good idea.
Your ship hasn't been fitted for this region.
There are environmental concerns.
What kind of concerns?
We haven't fully identified the anomalies yet.
They're calling this whole area the Briar Patch.
Took us a day to reach a location where we could even get a signal to you.
Just get me Data's schematics.
I'll keep you informed. Dougherty out.
- His emotion chip?
- He didn't take it with him.
- Send the Admiral Data's schematics.
- Aye, sir.
- Yes, sir?
- Ensign, would you report to the galley and tell the chef to skip the fish course?
Aye, sir.
I would like our guests to depart as soon as etiquette allows.
I'm going to ask Worf to delay his return to DS9 so that he can join us.
We're gonna stop by Sector 441 on our way to the Goren system.
- They are in opposite directions, sir.
- Are they?
I never should have let you talk me into that duck blind in the first place.
Your Federation procedures have made this mission ten times as difficult as it needed to be.
Our procedures were in place to protect the planet's population from unnecessary risk.
Planet's population, 600 people.
If you want to avoid unnecessary risks, next time, leave your android at home.
Bridge to Ahdar Ru'afo.
We are approaching the planet.
Take us into a high orbit.
Lie down, Admiral.
The girls'll take 20 years off your face.
- Another time, perhaps.
- Your self-restraint puzzles me, Admiral.
You continue to deny yourself every benefit this mission has to offer.
I prefer to wait until we can share the benefits with all the people of the Federation.
- Report.
- Phaser blast. Unknown origin.
Raise shields.
- Take us out of orbit.
- Photon torpedoes. Brace for impact.
- The vessel has broken off pursuit, sir.
- Visual contact.
That's our ship.
Captain, we're about to lose all communications with Starfleet.
Do you have everything you need from Command?
I've downloaded all the files on the duck blind mission
- and the Son'a.
- You have two days to become experts.
Mr. Worf, our job is to come up with a plan to safely capture Data.
I've already had Commander La Forge modify this tricorder with one of Data's actuation servos.
Its operational range is only 4 meters, but it will shut him down.
Good to have you back, Mr. Worf.
Slow to one-third. Take us in.
Half a century ago, they conquered two primitive races, the Tarlac and the Ellora, and then integrated them into their culture as a labor class.
Look at this.
The Son'a are known to have produced mass quantities of the narcotic ketracel-white.
Their ships are rumored to be equipped with isolytic subspace weapons outlawed by the Second Khitomer Accord.
Why would we be involved with these people?
Good question.
- You haven't done that in a long time.
- What?
- What you're doing to my neck.
- Was I doing something to your neck?
Bridge to Commander Worf.
- Worf!
- Captain.
I don't know how they do it on Deep Space Nine, but on the Enterprise, we still report for duty on time.
- Sorry, sir. I'm on my way.
- We'll skip the court-martial this time.
Picard out.
When was the last time we aligned the torque sensors?
- Two months ago, sir.
- They don't sound right.
The torque sensors are out of alignment by 12 microns.
You could hear that?
When I was an ensign, I could detect a three-micron misalignment.
Excuse me, sir. The Son'a ship with Admiral Dougherty aboard has entered tracking range.
Straighten your baldric, Commander.
On screen.
Captain, I wasn't expecting you.
This is too important for the Enterprise to be on the sidelines, Admiral.
I wish I had better news.
Commander Data attacked us in a mission scout ship yesterday.
Ru'afo and I have decided to send in an assault team.
Commander Worf and I are working on several tactical plans to see...
Your android has turned dangerously violent, Captain.
Considerable damage was done to my ship. He must be destroyed.
I know what Data means to Starfleet,
Jean-Luc, but our crew is at the mercy of those people on the planet.
If our first attempt to capture Data fails,
I will terminate him.
I should be the one to do it.
I'm his captain and his friend.
All right, you have 12 hours, Captain.
Then I want you out of the Briar Patch.
In the meantime, we'll head out to the perimeter to call for Son'a reinforcements in case you fail.
- Understood.
- Good luck, Captain. Dougherty out.
Sensors are not picking up any ships coming from the surface.
Transmit a wideband covariant signal.
That ought to get his attention.
He must be using the planet's rings to mask his approach.
The metaphasic radiation from the rings is in a state of extreme flux.
We'll steer clear of those.
Come out, come out, wherever you are
Sir?
That's something that my mother...
Hold on.
Open all hailing frequencies.
Data, this is Captain Picard.
Data, please respond.
If we fire tachyon bursts, it might force him to reset his shield harmonics.
- When he does, we can beam him out.
- Make it so.
Direct hit.
He's resetting his shield harmonics.
Beam him out.
- He has activated a transport inhibitor.
- Prepare to enter the atmosphere.
We'll use the ionospheric boundary to shake him.
Scanners are off-line.
Evasive maneuvers, heading 1-4-0 mark 3-1.
He can fly a ship.
He can anticipate tactical strategies.
Clearly his brain is functioning.
We've seen how he responds to threats.
I wonder how he would respond...
Mr. Worf, do you know Gilbert and Sullivan?
No, sir, I have not had a chance to meet all the new crew members since I have been back.
They're composers, Worf, from the 19th century.
Data was rehearsing a production of H.M.S. Pinafore just before he left.
A British tar is a soaring soul
As free as a mountain bird
His energetic fist should be ready to resist
A dictatorial word
Sing, Worf, sing.
His nose should pant
And his lip should curl
His cheeks should flame
And his brow should furl
His bosom should heave
And his heart should glow
And his fist be ever ready for a knockdown blow
His nose should pant
And his lip should curl
His cheeks should flame and his brow should furl
His bosom should heave and his heart should glow
And his fist be ever ready for a knockdown blow
Prepare the docking clamps.
His eyes should flash with an inborn fire
His brow with scorn be wrung
He never should bow down to a domineering frown
- Or the tang of a tyrant tongue
- Or the tang of a tyrant tongue
His heart should stamp
And his throat should growl
His hair should curl
And his face should scowl
His eyes should flash
And his breast protrude
And this should be his customary attitude
His foot should stamp
And his throat should growl
His hair should curl and his face...
Inertial coupling is exceeding tolerance.
If we do not release him, he may destroy both vessels.
I'm not letting go of him.
- We must stabilize the damping field.
- Reroute emergency power to inertial dampers.
The auto-sequencer was damaged by phaser fire.
Transferring controls to manual.
Power sequence realigned.
Engaging stabilizers.
- Damping field established.
- Maximum power.
Now, Mr. Worf.
Captain, Commander Data is safely in custody.
Captain, Subahdar Gallatin,
Son'a Command.
Lieutenant Curtis, attaché to Admiral Dougherty.
- Are you all right?
- We've been treated extremely well.
They have incredible mental discipline, clarity of perception.
- My name is Sojef.
- Jean-Luc Picard.
These are my officers,
Dr. Crusher, Counselor Troi.
- Would you like something to eat?
- No, we're here to rescue them.
As you wish, but I would ask you to disarm yourselves.
This village is a sanctuary of life.
Prepare the hostages for transport to the ship.
They should be quarantined before joining the ship's population.
We were under the impression they were being held against their will.
It's not our custom to have guests here at all, let alone hold anyone against their will.
The artificial life-form would not allow them to leave.
In fact, he told us they were our enemies and that more would follow.
- Are you our enemy?
- Anij.
My people have a strict policy of non-interference in other cultures.
It's our Prime Directive.
Your directive apparently doesn't include spying on other cultures.
The artificial life-form is a member of my crew.
Apparently, he was taken ill.
There was a phase variance in his positronic matrix which we were unable to repair.
I think the Captain finds it hard to believe that we'd have any skills repairing a positronic device.
Our technological abilities are not apparent because we have chosen not to employ them in our daily lives.
We believe that when you create a machine to do the work of a man, you take something away from the man.
But at one time, we explored the galaxy, just as you do.
- You have warp capability?
- Capability, yes.
But where can warp drive take us except away from here?
I apologize for our intrusion.
And because they have warp capability, the consequences to their society will be minimal.
You've done a terrific job, Jean-Luc.
Now pack your bags and get the hell out of there.
How's Data?
In stasis.
La Forge is completing the diagnostic.
I'll need all your paperwork tomorrow.
We're heading back your way.
Set a course to rendezvous with us, so you can transfer the crew and equipment on your way out.
You're not finished here?
Just a few loose ends to tie up.
Dougherty out.
Come in.
- Hi.
- You got a minute?
Sure.
I need a little counseling.
Well, there's a first time for everything.
So, do I lie down or what?
Well, whatever makes you comfortable, but this isn't one of the usual therapeutic postures.
- But it is comfortable.
- Why don't you try sitting up?
Why don't you try lying down?
Well, you're in quite a mood today.
Do you really need counseling or did you come down here to play?
- I think I'm having a midlife crisis.
- I believe you.
I'm not sleeping well.
Dr. Crusher has something that can take care of that.
What I need,
I can't get from Dr. Crusher.
Counselor, do you think it's possible for two people to go back in time, fix a mistake they've made?
On this ship, anything's possible.
- Yuck!
- Yuck?
- I never kissed you with a beard before.
- I kiss you and you say "yuck"?
I had to reconstruct Data's neural net and replace these.
They contain memory engrams.
- How were they damaged?
- By a Son'a weapon.
There's no doubt about it, Captain.
That's what caused Data to malfunction.
But the Son'a report claims that they didn't fire until after he malfunctioned.
Well, I don't believe it happened that way.
Why would they fire on him without provocation?
All I know is that he was functioning normally until he was shot.
Then his fail-safe system was activated.
Fail-safe?
His ethical and moral subroutines took over all of his basic functions.
But you're saying that he still knew the difference between right and wrong.
In a sense, that's all he knew.
The system is designed to protect Data against anyone who might try to take advantage of his memory loss.
And yet he attacked us, and he told the Ba'ku that we were a threat.
- Are the implants bothering you?
- I'm all right. I think I'm just tired.
- Geordi? Captain?
- You're on the Enterprise, Data.
I seem to be missing several memory engrams.
There they are.
Data, what's the last thing that you remember?
His nose should pant and his lips should curl
From the mission.
I was in an isolation suit gathering physiometric data on the Ba'ku.
My last memory is going into the hills following some children.
Artim, do you remember where you were on the day of lightning when the artificial life-form appeared to us?
- In the hills by the dam.
- Can you show us?
There is no reason to fear me.
I am now operating within normal parameters.
- What?
- They fixed me.
- Captain, the boy is afraid of me.
- It's nothing personal, Data.
You have to remember, these people have rejected technology.
I am the personification of everything they have rejected.
Until this week, that young man probably never saw a machine, let alone one that walks and talks.
Bridge to Riker.
Can I get back to you, Mr. Worf?
Admiral Dougherty is on the comm link, sir.
Patch him through. Yes, Admiral?
Why haven't you left orbit?
Captain Picard is still on the surface, sir.
Doing what?
He didn't want to leave until we could adequately explain why Data malfunctioned.
His future in Starfleet could depend on it.
Remind the Captain his 12 hours are up.
- Yes, sir.
- Dougherty out.
Your body is producing far too many toxins.
We've reached the limit of genetic manipulation.
I won't need anymore genetic manipulation if our Federation friends will allow us to complete this mission.
Tricorder functions are limited due to heavy deposits of kelbonite in these hills.
How about a passive radiation scan?
Curious.
There appear to be strong neutrino emissions coming from the lake.
- Can he breathe underwater?
- Data doesn't breathe.
- Won't he rust?
- No.
Captain! Captain!
I believe I know what is causing the neutrino emissions.
The vessel is clearly Federation in origin, Captain.
"Just a few loose ends to tie up."
- We're not interested in such things.
- I am.
- I think it would be wiser if you didn't...
- I'm going with you.
It is a holographic projection.
Incomplete, I might add.
What you're seeing is a computer-driven image created by photons and force fields.
I know what a hologram is, Captain.
The question is, why would anyone want to create one of our village?
Data, if you were following the children and discovered this ship...
It is conceivable, I was shot to protect the secret of its existence.
Why would they duplicate this village except to deceive the Ba'ku?
- Deceive us?
- To move you off this planet.
You go to sleep one night in the village, wake up the next morning on this flying holodeck, transported en masse.
Within a few days, they're relocated on a similar planet without ever realizing it.
Why would the Federation or the Son'a wish to move the Ba'ku?
I don't know.
Computer, end program.
Decloak the vessel.
Help! I can't swim!
Don't panic.
I've been shot at, thrown into the lake out of a ship that's come to abduct us.
What's there to panic about?
In the event of a water landing,
I have been designed to serve as a floatation device.
Mr. Worf, did the hostages mention anything about a cloaked ship during their debriefing?
- No, sir.
- Debrief them again.
- Have you been in a fight, Mr. Worf?
- No, sir. It is a gorch.
A gorch?
A pimple, sir.
Well, it's hardly noticeable.
Smooth as an android's bottom, eh, Data?
I beg your pardon, sir?
Admiral Dougherty wants to know why we haven't left yet.
We're not going anywhere.
Deck 5.
You Klingons never do anything small, do you?
Dr. Crusher asked to speak to you when you returned.
- Picard to Crusher.
- Captain.
The Son'a hostages declined to be examined.
I had them confined to quarters.
- And our people?
- They're fine.
In fact, they're better than fine.
Increased metabolism, improved muscle tone, high energy.
We should all be so lucky.
Very well, Doctor. Picard out.
Worf, don't release the Son'a officers till I've talked to Ahdar Ru'afo.
Aye, sir.
Commander, may I...
Computer, music.
- No. Not that, something Latin.
- Specify.
The mambo.
That's more like it.
How old are you?
We came here from a solar system on the verge of self-annihilation, where technology had created weapons that threatened to destroy all life.
A small group of us set off to find a new home, a home that would be isolated from the threats of other worlds.
That was 309 years ago.
And you haven't aged a day since then.
Actually, I was a good deal older when we arrived, in terms of my physical condition.
There's an unusual metaphasic radiation coming from the planet's rings.
It continuously regenerates our genetic structure.
- You must've noticed the effects by now.
- We've just begun to.
- I suppose you're 75.
- No, I'm 12.
The metaphasic radiation won't begin to affect him until he reaches maturity.
To most off-landers, what you have here is more valuable than gold-pressed latinum.
I'm afraid that's the reason that someone may be trying to take your world away from you.
The artificial life-form was right.
If it were not for Data, it's probable that you would be relocated by now.
How can we possibly defend ourselves?
The moment we pick up a weapon, we become one of them.
- We lose everything we are.
- It may not come to that.
Clearly, the architects of this conspiracy want to keep it a secret, not only from you, but from my people, as well.
I don't intend to let them.
We've always known that to survive, we had to remain apart.
It hasn't been easy.
Many of the young people want to know more about the offland.
They're attracted to stories of a faster pace of life.
Most of my people who live that fast a life would sell their souls to slow it down.
But not you?
There are days.
You don't live up to your reputation as an offlander, Picard.
Well, in defense of offlanders, there are many more people like me.
Who wouldn't be tempted by the promise of perpetual youth?
I don't think so.
You give me more credit than I deserve.
Well, of course I'm tempted.
Who wouldn't be?
But some of the darkest chapters in the history of my world involve the forced relocation of a small group of people to satisfy the demands of a large one.
I'd hoped that we had learned from our mistakes but it seems that some of us haven't.
This is extraordinary craftsmanship.
It's the work of students.
They're almost ready to become apprentices.
In 30 or 40 years, some of them will take their place among the artisans.
Apprenticing for 30 years.
Did your people's mental discipline develop here?
More questions. Always the explorer.
- If you stay long enough, that'll change.
- Will it?
You stop reviewing what happened yesterday, stop planning for tomorrow.
Let me ask you a question.
Have you ever experienced a perfect moment in time?
A perfect moment?
When time seemed to stop and you could almost live in that moment?
Seeing my home planet from space for the first time.
Yes, exactly.
Nothing more complicated than perception.
You explore the universe.
We've discovered that a single moment in time can be a universe in itself, full of powerful forces.
Most people aren't aware enough of the now to even notice.
I wish I could spare a few centuries to learn.
It took us centuries to learn that it doesn't have to take centuries to learn.
There's one thing I don't understand.
In 300 years, you never learned to swim?
I just haven't got around to it yet.
I wonder if you're aware of the trust you engender, Jean-Luc Picard.
- In my experience, it's unusual for...
- For an offlander?
For someone so young.
- Geordi?
- Captain.
As it turns out, there wasn't anything wrong with my implants at all.
There was something right with my eyes.
When Dr. Crusher removed the ocular connection, she found that the cells around my optic nerve had...
Started to regenerate.
It may not last, and if it doesn't, I just...
I just wanted, before we go...
You know, I've never seen a sunrise, at least, not the way you see them.
Come.
Am I to understand that you're not releasing my men, Captain?
We found the holoship.
Ru'afo, why don't you let the Captain and me...
No!
This entire mission has been one Federation blunder after another.
You will return my men or this alliance will end with the destruction of your ship.
You're looking well, Jean-Luc. Rested.
I won't let you move them, Admiral.
I will take this to the Federation Council.
I'm acting on orders from the Federation Council.
How can there be an order to abandon the Prime Directive?
The Prime Directive doesn't apply.
These people are not indigenous to this planet.
They were never meant to be immortal.
We'll simply be restoring them to their natural evolution.
Who the hell are we to determine the next course of evolution for this people?
Jean-Luc, there are 600 people down there.
We'll be able to use the regenerative properties of this radiation to help billions.
The Son'a have developed a procedure to collect the metaphasic particles from the planet's rings.
- A planet in Federation space.
- That's right.
We have the planet.
They have the technology, a technology we can't duplicate.
You know what that makes us?
Partners.
Our partners are nothing more than petty thugs.
On Earth, petroleum once turned petty thugs into world leaders.
Warp drive transformed a bunch of Romulan thugs into an empire.
We can handle the Son'a.
I'm not worried about that.
Someone probably said the same thing about the Romulans a century ago.
With metaphasics, lifespans will be doubled.
An entire new medical science will evolve.
I understand your chief engineer has the use of his eyes for the first time in his life.
Will you take that away from him?
There are metaphasic particles all over the Briar Patch.
Why does it have to be this one planet?
It's the concentration in the rings that makes the whole damn thing work.
Don't ask me to explain it.
I only know they inject something into the rings that starts a thermolytic reaction.
When it's over, the planet will be uninhabitable for generations.
Admiral, delay the procedure.
Let my people look at the technology.
Our best scientific minds already have.
We can't find any other way to do this.
Then the Son'a can establish a separate colony on the planet until we do.
It would take 10 years of normal exposure to begin to reverse their condition.
Some of them won't survive that long.
Besides, they don't want to live in the middle of the Briar Patch.
- Who would?
- The Ba'ku.
We are betraying the principles upon which the Federation was founded.
It's an attack upon its very soul.
And it will destroy the Ba'ku, just as cultures have been destroyed in every other forced relocation throughout history.
Jean-Luc, we're only moving 600 people.
How many people does it take, Admiral, before it becomes wrong?
A thousand? Fifty thousand? A million?
How many people does it take, Admiral?
I'm ordering you to the Goren system.
I'm also ordering the release of the Son'a officers.
File whatever protests you wish to, Captain.
By the time you do, this will all be done.
Gallatin.
So, the righteous Starfleet captain finally released you.
Yes.
Did you encounter any problems on the surface?
No, sir.
But it wasn't easy being among them.
I'm sure.
Just don't forget what they did to us.
We'll have them rounded up in a day or two.
We needn't bother with a Federation holoship anymore.
- Just get the holding cells ready.
- Yes, sir.
I'm going to miss these little flesh-stretching sessions of ours, my dear.
Re-routing the transport grid to avoid detection was wise, sir.
However, the transporter is rarely used after 0200 hours.
Taking the Captain's yacht out for a spin?
Seven metric tons of ultritium explosives, eight tetryon pulse launchers and 10 isomagnetic disintegrators.
Looks like you're planning on doing some hunting.
Return to your quarters.
- That's an order.
- No uniform, no orders.
Captain, how could I look at another sunrise knowing what my sight cost these people?
I feel obliged to point out that the environmental anomalies may have stimulated certain rebellious instincts common to youth, which could affect everyone's judgment.
Except mine, of course.
Okay, Data, what do you think we should do?
Saddle up. Lock and load.
They won't begin the procedure while the planet is still inhabited, so our job is to keep the planet inhabited.
Will, Geordi, go back and put a face on what's happening here.
Make the Council see the Ba'ku.
It's too easy to turn a blind eye to the suffering of a people you don't know.
- I'll be back before you know it.
- We'll hold out as long as we can.
The injector performs perfectly in every simulation.
Sir, as the Enterprise left orbit, one of their support craft went down to the surface.
What?
Appeared to be the Captain's yacht.
Five persons onboard.
We're not waiting until morning.
Take the shuttles and get everyone off the surface tonight.
Gallatin.
If Picard or any of his people interfere, eliminate them.
We're leaving the village!
Take only what you need!
Bring food!
We may not be back for days!
It is a transport inhibitor.
It will help prevent spaceships from beaming anyone off the surface.
These veins of kelbonite running through the hills will interfere with their transporters, and when the terrain forces us away from the deposits, then we'll use transport inhibitors as a compensation.
The mountains have the heaviest concentration of kelbonite.
Once there, it'll make transport virtually impossible.
There are caves in those mountains.
Then we should be able to hold out for a long time once we're there, but they're not gonna make it easy for us to get there.
Captain!
We've activated the transport inhibitors around the village.
Good.
Let's move these people out!
Transporters are not functioning.
They're blocking the beams with some kind of inhibitors.
We'll have to locate and destroy them.
No, no. Son, you're carrying too much.
We have a long climb ahead of us.
We've lost three transport inhibitors.
There's a gap in the field.
Artim!
Father!
They're following the kelbonite deposits, using the interference to block our transporters.
- Recommendations?
- Take me down. Let me talk to Picard.
Talk!
We should send down an assault team and take them by force.
That is not an acceptable option.
If people get hurt, all the support we have in the Federation...
Federation support,
Federation procedures,
Federation rules.
Look in the mirror, Admiral.
The Federation is old.
In the past 24 months, they've been challenged by every major power in the quadrant.
The Borg, the Cardassians, the Dominion, they all smell the scent of death on the Federation.
That's why you've embraced our offer, because it will give your dear Federation new life.
Well, how badly do you want it,
Admiral?
Because there are hard choices to be made now.
If the Enterprise gets through with news about their brave Captain's valiant struggle on behalf of the defenseless Ba'ku, your Federation politicians will waver.
Your Federation opinion polls will open a public debate.
Your Federation allies will want their say. Need I go on?
There's an alternative to an all-out assault.
Isolinear tags would allow our transporters to lock onto them.
We'd have to tag every one of them.
That would take time, and we don't have it.
The Enterprise is only 19 hours from communications range with the Federation.
- I'll order Riker to turn around.
- Picard's first officer.
You really believe he'll listen?
My ships are capable of intercepting the Enterprise before it reaches the perimeter.
I could send them to...
To escort it back.
But Commander Riker might not want to come.
Send your ships.
- Do you like being a machine?
- I aspire to be more than I am.
I know why. So people like us won't be afraid of you anymore.
Perhaps.
Don't you ever get tired?
My power cells continually recharge themselves.
I can't imagine what it's like to be a machine.
Perhaps it would surprise you to know that I have often tried to imagine what it is like to be a child.
- Really?
- Really.
For one thing, your legs are shorter than everyone else's.
But they are in a constant state of growth.
- Do you find it difficult to adapt?
- Adapt?
A child's specifications are never the same from one moment to the next.
It is a wonder you do not trip over your own feet.
Sometimes I do.
My legs are exactly 87.2 centimeters in length.
They were 87.2 centimeters the day I was created.
They will be 87.2 centimeters the day I go off-line.
My operation depends on specifications that do not change.
I will never know the experience of growing up or tripping over my own feet.
But you've never had adults telling you what to do all the time or bedtimes or having to eat food you don't like.
I would gladly accept the requirement of a bedtime in exchange for knowing what it is like to be a child.
- Do machines ever play?
- Yes. I play the violin, and my chess routines are quite advanced.
No, I mean, haven't you ever just played for fun?
Androids do not have fun.
Look, if you wanna know what it's like to be a child, you need to learn to play.
Captain.
Mr. Worf, you need a haircut.
Accelerated hair growth is often experienced by Klingons during jak'tahla.
- Jak'tahla?
- Roughly translated, puberty, although for a Klingon, that scarcely does it justice.
Any severe mood swings, unusual aggressive tendencies,
- you let me know at once.
- Yes, sir.
The Ba'ku need some rest, sir.
According to the geo-scan, this is the safest area within the next few kilometers.
Very well. We'll take an hour.
- Have them break out some rations.
- Aye, sir.
Right beyond that ridge is where the caves begin.
We can hide there for days.
By now, the Son'a will have scanned this area.
They'll know that as well as we do.
It's been 300 years since I've seen a bald man.
How is it that you never married?
And don't tell me it's just because you haven't got around to it yet.
- What's the rush?
- I should warn you,
I've always been attracted to older women.
- How are you doing this?
- No more questions.
Commander, I'm showing two Son'a ships on an intercept course.
- How long till they reach us?
- Eighteen minutes.
We won't be able to get a transmission out of here for at least another hour.
They're hailing us.
Tell them our transceiver assembly is down, that we can send messages but not receive them.
- I don't think they believe us.
- Why not?
Photon torpedo.
Isn't that the universal greeting when communications are down?
I think it's the universal greeting when you don't like someone.
Full impulse.
Manifolds can't handle full impulse in the Patch, Commander.
If we don't outrun them, the manifolds'll be the only thing left on the ship.
- I'll be in Engineering.
- Red alert! All hands, battle stations!
And have you noticed how your boobs have started to firm up?
Not that we care about such things in this day and age.
Thank you, Data.
I've an odd craving for the blood of a live Kolar beast.
This environment must be affecting me again.
And have you noticed how your boobs have started to firm up?
Not that we care about...
Take cover!
Isolinear tags.
The transporters can lock onto them.
We have to find shelter.
There's a cavern at the base of the next hill.
This way!
- Shields at 60%.
- Engineering to Bridge.
We're burning deuterium down here.
We're gonna blow ourselves up.
We won't need any help from the Son'a!
What's inside that nebula cluster?
Cometary debris, pockets of unstable metreon gas.
We don't want to go in there, sir.
Yes, we do.
I'll take it from here, Ensign.
Time to use the Briar Patch the way Brer Rabbit did.
Inside the caves, quickly! Everyone!
This way!
Inside.
Definitely feeling aggressive tendencies, sir.
They've detonated an isolytic burst.
A subspace tear is forming.
On screen.
I thought subspace weapons were banned by the Khitomer Accord.
Remind me to lodge a protest.
Our warp core is acting like a magnet to the tear.
We're pulling it like a zipper across space.
Options?
- We could eject the core.
- Will that stop the tear?
You got me, Commander.
That's your expert opinion?
Detonating the warp core might neutralize the cascade.
Then again, it might not.
Subspace weapons are unpredictable.
That's why they were banned.
The tear is closing on us.
- Impact in 15 seconds.
- Eject the core.
I just did.
Impact in 10 seconds.
Detonate!
Get me a medic over here!
It worked, Commander.
The tear has been sealed.
Yeah, but there's nothing to stop them from doing it again, and we're fresh out of warp cores.
We're still 36 minutes from transmission range, sir.
We're through running from these bastards.
Another 43 reported taken, sir.
Captain, they're trying to drive us out so their drones can tag us.
With all the hydrothermal vents in the substrata, the structural integrity of this cavern is not going to hold for long.
- Is there another way out of here?
- I don't know.
Captain, tracking the water's course may reveal another exit.
Mr. Worf, come with us.
I'm reading a nitrogen-oxygen flow behind that calcite formation, Captain.
Will this structure hold if we were to blast through?
I believe it is safe, sir.
Fire.
Get everybody into those caves, and set up force fields once they're inside.
Aye, sir.
Geordi, are those pockets of metreon gas?
Yes, Commander. Highly volatile.
I'd recommend we keep our distance.
Negative. I want to use the ramscoop to collect as much of it as we can.
The purpose being?
The purpose being,
I intend to shove it down the Son'a's throat.
Commander, if one of their weapons hits that gas...
It's our only way out of here,
Mr. Daniels.
I wouldn't be surprised if history remembers this as the Riker Maneuver.
If it works.
Computer, access manual steering column.
Transfer helm controls to manual.
Bridge, storage cells are at maximum capacity.
They're powering their forward weapons array, sir.
Blow out the ramscoop.
Stand by. Full thrusters.
Ramscoop released.
Captain.
Data, Troi, keep these people moving.
Bring them out.
I suspect it won't be long before the drones get here.
Keep moving! Keep moving!
They found caves on higher ground.
We'll be safe there.
Captain, take a look at this med-scan, his DNA profile.
- How can that be possible?
- Maybe we should ask them.
Artim, what are you doing? Come.
- Is this the last group?
- Yes, sir.
Get them ready to move out.
We need to hurry.
Anij went to find Artim.
- Go with Tournel!
- No, I wanna stay with you!
It is safer there. Go!
Worf to Picard!
Two life-signs, one of them extremely faint.
There are almost 4 metric tons of rock blocking our way.
No. That might cause another cave-in.
Anij?
Anij?
- Worf to Picard.
- Yes? Yes, I can hear you.
We are trying to get to you, sir.
Anij.
Help is on the way.
- Worf, hurry. Anij is hurt.
- How bad is she, Captain?
- I'm losing her.
- We're coming as fast as we can.
Anij, stay with me.
Help me find the power to keep you in this moment.
Stay with me.
Don't let go of this moment.
She's stabilizing.
- Is it safe to move her?
- Safer than leaving her here.
And you thought it would take centuries to learn.
Order them to surrender and
I promise you won't be court-martialed.
If a court-martial is the only way to let the people of the Federation know what is happening here, I welcome it.
The Enterprise has destroyed one of my ships!
The other is on fire, requesting assistance.
The Enterprise would only fire to defend itself.
Ru'afo must have ordered the attack.
I can't believe he would have given that order without your consent, Admiral.
I wonder which of us will be facing that court-martial.
There's nothing further to be gained from this.
You're right. This is going to end now.
The Ba'ku want to stay on the planet.
Let them.
- I'm going to launch the injector.
- You're not going to launch anything...
In six hours, every living thing in this system will be dead or dying.
You would kill your own people, Ru'afo?
Your own parents, brothers, sisters?
Didn't you know, Admiral?
The Son'a and the Ba'ku are the same race.
Picard just told us.
Our DNA is identical.
Which one were you? Gal'na? Ro'tin?
Those names, those children are gone forever.
What's he talking about?
A century ago, a group of our young people wanted to follow the ways of the offlanders.
They tried to take over the colony, and when they failed...
When we failed, you exiled us to die slowly.
You're Ro'tin, aren't you?
There's something in the voice.
Would you be his friend, Gal'na?
I helped your mother bathe you when you were a child.
She still speaks of you.
You've brought the Federation into the middle of a blood feud, Admiral.
The children have returned to expel their elders, just as they were once expelled, except that Ru'afo's need for revenge has now escalated into parricide.
It was for the Federation.
It was all for the Federation.
We're taking this ship out of here.
This mission is over.
- It is not over.
- It is over!
I do not take orders from you!
If you launch the injector while the planet's still populated, the Federation will pursue you until...
The Federation will never know what happened here.
Admiral Dougherty will not be joining us for dinner.
Deploy the collector.
- Do you have a problem with that order?
- May I talk to you alone?
- Deploy the collector.
- Yes, sir.
Moving them is one thing.
Killing them all...
No one hated them more than you, Gal'na.
We've come a long way together.
This is the moment we've planned for so many years.
Separate the Starfleet personnel and secure them in the aft cargo hold.
See that Picard joins them.
The shields in that section won't protect them against the thermolytic reaction.
Thank you for reminding me.
Jean-Luc.
Come with me.
It must have been strange for you when you were a hostage, surrounded by all the friends and family you knew all those years ago, each one looking exactly as they did then.
Like looking through the eyes of childhood again.
And here you are, closing those eyes, trying not to see what bitterness has done to the Son'a, how it's turned Ru'afo into a madman.
And you, turned you into a coward, a man who denies his own conscience.
Get in.
A coward without the moral courage to prevent an atrocity.
You offend me!
Is this how a Federation officer pleads for his life?
I'm not pleading for my life.
I'm pleading for yours.
You can still go home, Gal'na.
Computer, close turbolift doors.
What you're asking me to do is impossible.
Do you know how to disable the injector?
I would need to be on the Bridge.
The crew is loyal to Ru'afo.
An assault would fail.
Perhaps we can lure him away.
It doesn't matter where he is.
As soon as he realizes something's happening, he'll override my commands with one word to his comm link.
If he doesn't realize something's happening...
Can you get me to a transmitter?
I need to speak with Data and Worf down on the planet.
We'll need their help.
Deck 12.
Initiate separation protocols.
Activating injector assembly.
Separation in three minutes.
A small craft is coming up from the surface.
It's powering up its weapons.
- On screen.
- One person aboard. It's the android.
He's no threat.
- Data to Picard.
- Go ahead, Data.
Captain, they're ignoring my attack.
Keep firing tachyon bursts into the shield grid.
- Is Worf in position?
- Yes, sir.
He is ready for simultaneous transport.
We're approaching the Bridge.
Picard out.
Separation in one minute.
Sir, the Federation ship is creating a disruption in our shield.
If they go out of phase, it'll increase our exposure to the thermolytic reaction.
Very well. Destroy that ship.
Reset our shield harmonics.
Do not delay the countdown.
Data to Picard.
They are rotating their shield harmonics.
I am attempting to return to the surface, sir.
The Federation ship has been disabled.
Separation in 20 seconds.
- What is that?
- I don't know.
- The systems don't seem affected.
- Separation in 10 seconds.
Five seconds.
Injector assembly has separated.
Exactly as the simulations predicted.
I'm not showing any change in metaphasic flux levels.
Your scanners must be malfunctioning.
All ship functions are off-line.
How can there be no ship functions if the viewscreen is working?
Artificial gravity is stable.
Life support is...
A holodeck.
We were transported to the holoship when we reset our shields.
Everything we saw was an illusion.
Ru'afo, authorization Delta 2-1.
Override all interlinked commands to injector assembly one.
Unable to comply.
Injector assembly one has been deactivated.
All injector subsystems aboard the collector are confirmed off-line.
Decloak the holoship and engage a tractor beam.
Aye, sir.
The crew knows something's happened.
I've secured the Bridge.
This ship is equipped with 14 long-range transporters.
Are they all useless?
They must have been locked and secured after we were beamed here.
Isolate one and re-route its command sequence through the auxiliary processor.
Sir, there's nothing we can do.
They already have control of our ship.
I don't plan on going back to our ship.
- Mr. Worf, destroy that thing.
- Aye, sir.
Weapons systems have been taken off-line.
The crew is re-routing Bridge controls.
Captain, there is a problem aboard the collector.
The launch sequence has resumed.
Collector shields have been raised.
Someone's onboard.
It's Ru'afo.
Can you override the launch sequence from here?
Not without his access codes.
Is there a self-destruct?
Yes, but without the codes, it would have to be activated at the upper control matrix on the collector.
Mr. Worf, try and find some way to beam through those shields.
You'd have to detonate it manually.
There'd only be a two-second delay.
We may be able to transport between the shield generators if we are within 100 meters.
Take us into position.
Remain at your post, Commander.
I'll need you to beam me back.
We're approaching the collector.
One minute before separation, you'll see the cryogenic tanks venting.
Weapons fire could ignite the exhaust.
Separation in 2 minutes and 15 seconds.
Intruder alert. Intruder alert.
Captain!
Worf?
I'm picking up Captain Picard's bio-signature onboard the collector.
- Enterprise to Picard!
- Number One.
We're approaching your position.
Do you need assistance?
I may need a lift in a minute or so.
We're on our way.
Separation in one minute.
- Report.
- It's Ru'afo's ship!
On screen.
Sensors are reading over
100 Ba'ku onboard and one Klingon.
Target their ventral engines and life support.
Set a collision course.
Stop!
Ru'afo, we're getting too old for this.
After today, that won't be a problem for either of us.
Separation in 30 seconds.
You're really going to risk igniting the exhaust?
All right, I will!
- Shields at 60%.
- Hold your course.
- He wouldn't.
- Yes, he would.
Now!
Stand by, Captain.
We're right around the corner.
Sorry, time's up.
What kept you, Number One?
The Federation Council has asked me to inform you that the Ba'ku relocation will be halted while they conduct a top-level review.
Sir, Ru'afo's ship is hailing us.
- On screen.
- On screen.
Captain, the Son'a crew would like to negotiate a cease-fire.
It may have something to do with the fact that we have three minutes of air left.
We have plenty over here, Mr. Worf.
Prepare to beam aboard.
You think when we get away from this metaphasic radiation, it'll change the way we feel?
Your feelings about her have not changed since the day I met you, Commander.
This place just let them out for a little fresh air.
I wish there were a way to bring them back home.
Ask them.
I'm afraid there's too much bitterness on both sides.
Mother and son.
You arranged this?
I thought it might begin the healing process.
What am I going to do without you?
I wish I could stay, but these are perilous times for the Federation.
I can't abandon it to people who would threaten everything that I've spent a lifetime defending.
I have to go back, if only to slow things down at the Federation Council.
But I have 318 days of shore leave coming and
I intend to use them.
Data?
It's time to go.
I have to go home now.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Mr. Data, I hope we'll see you again.
Data! Don't forget.
You have to have a little fun every day.
Good advice.
Picard to Enterprise. Seven to beam up.
Energize.
Houston, this is Excursion.
We see a good orbit-insertion burn. Over.
Excursion, this is Houston.
We copy and concur.
Good 0-1 burn.
Houston, can you confirm good K. U. antenna coverage
for lander deploy?
INCO, this is the flight director.
How is our K. U. for lander docking system release?
Flight, this is INCO.
We should have good K. U. coverage all the way through L. DS. release.
In fact, we're covered all the way through the landing and air lock egress.
Houston, stack going to minus Z-L-V.

We confirm rover two's telemetry is go for deploy.
Excursion, this is Houston.
Are you receiving rover one's carrier signal through the landers uplink?
That's affirm, Houston. We expect excellent video from rover one.
Not for one nation…
not for one people…
not for one creed…
but for all humankind.
Patrick Ross,
son of a senator, football star at Yale, and now the first man on Mars.
A perfect hero for these imperfect times.
Patrick, this is Excursion.
I need you to check rover two's next drilling site for me.
Patrick, would you take a look at your primary O-2…
and power levels on your DC. M
Suit parameters all look good.
Structure around is loamy.
Loose topsoil is rock.
Drill bit shows signs of wear and tear.
It'll last. One more area.
Sector 112, okay?
It might have been a canal bed.
Eight years of training, and I'm a Martian ditchdigger.
You have 1 hour, 30 minutes surface time left.
And counting.
Final sample loaded.
Prepping for air lock ingress.
In a world beset by violence, hunger and strife…
there are occasions when mankind surpasses…
the petty struggles of daily existence.
The Excursion voyage to Mars is one of those occasions.
Today America is proud.
I told them not to go!
Three, two, one…
Let's get you out of here.
Oh, my God.
It was incredible.
A tremendous achievement that once again proves…
that if we can rise above partisan politics…
America can climb to the heavens.
Thank you, Mr President.
The credit goes to my crew.
Fly home safe, son.
Our prayers are with you and…
God bless you.
Thank you, Mr President.
Flight, Nav. We'd like the crew to take a star tracker pass…
and perform an I. MU. alignment before we update the state vector.
CAPCOM, let the crew know Navigation wants a fix on a star position…
and alignment of the interior moment unit…
before putting a new state vector on board.
Houston, this is Excursion.
We have your new state vector on board.
Excursion, Houston. We copy you.
Have received the updated vector.
Coming up on TIG for transfer orbit burn.
Copy.
Excursion, you are good to go.
Thanks, Huston.

I told 'em not to go to Mars!
I told 'em not to go!
G. C., Flight. Check all relay stations on the network.
Have the backup TDRS on standby.
Flight to all operators.
Pull up your data passes from the burn.
Get with your back rooms.
Verify that we saw no anomalies.
For God's sake, somebody tell me she didn't blow.
Houston, this is Excursion.
We had a malfunction in the K. U. band antenna.
Lost telemetry and comm.
I performed a bit of I. F. M
Seems to be okay now.
Excursion crew is okay.
Headed for rendezvous with Big Blue.
It's gonna be good to get home.
Over and out.
The Extraterrestrial
Vulnerability Experiment… has one central goal: to discover a means to defend ourselves… against the alien species should they ever return to Earth.
Now, as you know, gentlemen,
Eve was re-created from a frozen lab embryo.
She's a genetic duplicate of the original Sil.
Now, we have deliberately shielded Eve… from any direct contact with the male gender… which is why, gentlemen, you're inside there.
So… proceed.
Help!
Laura! Please!
Okay, that's enough.
Bring her up.
Bingo, Dr Baker!
It worked!
Take a look at those beautiful welts.
Just beautiful.
What happened, Dr Baker?
Our problem in a nutshell:
A toxic agent works once… but then it becomes useless once the alien's biology adapts.
You've gone out of your way to give this… this lab animal… a living situation that's fit for a queen!
I suggest you spend more time finding a way to 86 the damn thing.
Colonel, you're welcome to replace me anytime you like.
I'm sorry, gentlemen.
Tell Dr Baker we must continue testing.
Aye, aye, sir.
Why do you do this to me?
I'm sorry, Eve.
I've explained to you why we've got to do this… what happened with the first Sil.
And why you have to be prepared.
Survival of the fittest.
I know.
I watch this TV… and I see all the places
I'm never gonna go… and see all the people
I'm never gonna meet.
Is that all I am to you?
A laboratory animal?
I want you to understand that the reason I took this job… was to make sure that these experiments were done with regard for you.
Just don't forget that I'm human too.
Main gear touchdown.
Shuttle ground support vehicles with flight surgeon and medical team…
in the crew recovery vehicle are en route.
Thanks, Houston.
It's good to be home.
–Thanks.
–You're welcome.
On preliminary examination, all three of you are in remarkable health… though, of course, I'll continue more specific blood testing.
We do have a few people here who would like a further examination.
Boy, there's enough fine booty out there to cure what ails me.
You're under quarantine,
Mr Gamble.
No sexual activity for at least ten days.
–And that means all of you.
–Oh, you've gotta be kidding.
No, I'm not kidding.
Back when President Kennedy began the space program…
I was just a very young assistant up on the Hill.
It didn't take me long to realize that he was a visionary… and that I shared that vision.
Later on, when I became a senator…
I was determined to push our program even further into space.
And so today,
Jack Kennedy's vision… is maintained by the commitment of American business.
But I like to think that his spirit is embodied… in young men like Patrick Ross.
–When Patrick was five years old…
–What happened to Patrick?
I don't know, but he's missing some major butt-kissing from his own father.
He hasn't been feeling very well tonight.
Tell you the truth, I haven't been feeling so great either.
Yeah, I think what we all need is a little tender loving care.
So it's with pleasure that I introduce one of our finest young leaders, the captain of the Mars mission, and my son, Patrick Ross.
I've gotta go.
Lincoln suite, upstairs.
Hurry.
Captain Ross, everyone's waiting. This way, sir.
Nice of you to show up.
Thank you all for coming out this evening.
Thank you, Father, for what I'm sure were overly kind words.
I've been chosen on behalf of my wonderful crew… to represent the mission to Mars… and an image that comes to my mind… is looking through the porthole… at the blue-white globe… beautiful… so fragile, so small.
And I thought to myself… how easy it would be to destroy all that God has created.
I think, as we look to the future… our greatest mission might be right here at home.
It's open.
Come on in.
My sister decided to join us.
We share everything… together.
Parker's going for two, and he's in there, standing!
Pulse rate is 20 percent below human norm.
What do you expect, Brea?
She's watching baseball.
Oh, God!
You are a hero.
Oh, God.
It's my turn.
Yes, it is.
Here it comes!
Parker's going for three!
Jeez! Did someone hit a home run?
My God, help me!
Get off me!
Marcy! Get him off me!
Oh, my God!
Help me, someone!
–What the hell is going on?
–My God!
Last night, after the fund-raiser… something happened.
I try to think about it,
I draw a total blank.
They always make those drinks at those fund-raisers strong.
That's the way they get the wallets to open up.
Billy, you tell that old son-of-a-bitch
I won't take no for an answer.
There's something wrong with me,
Dad, since I got back.
Do you think a trip to Mars was rough?
You just wait till you try a senate campaign.
Dad, listen to me.
I'm having…
I'm having some kind of breakdown.
Stop thinking about the master plan and help me, all right? I'm scared.
Goddamn it!
Quit acting like a spoiled child.
You're a Ross.
Behave like one.
And I'm gonna give you a piece of advice, boy.
You keep your dick in your pants and your eyes on the prize.
Oh, I know what you been doin', and frankly, I don't give a damn.
But I have seen too many young men with promising careers… piss it all away on a piece of ass.
People love you, Patrick.
Hell, boy, they idolize you.
You're gonna be President of the United States someday.
Now, let's take a walk through the gallery.
Some of my illustrious colleagues are just dyin' to get your autograph.
Yes, sir.
Yes, it's very important that I speak with Herman Cromwell.
No, he's a patient there.
Well, can I get a message to him that Dr Orinsky called
from the lab at Oldham Space Center up in Maryland?
Yes, it's very important that I speak to him.
I'm an old colleague of his.
I can't believe this.
Oh, my God!
Company, halt! Left, left…
The substance found
in Dr Orinsky's wounds is combinant alien-human DNA.
This DNA is structurally similar to Eve's… but it's not a perfect match.
Obviously, Eve has not left the compound… which means, gentlemen, that there's another one out there.
None of our intelligence suggests that a foreign power was involved.
How do we start looking for this thing?
Well, I would suggest normal investigative procedure… to cultivate a list of possible suspects and then test their blood.
Thank you, Dr Baker. We may ask you to help us track it down.
Always a pleasure, gentlemen.
Get Press Lennox.
Ladies and gentlemen, the embassy is secure.
The hostages are free.
Press Lennox.
Diplomatic security.
Provides embassy guards… and protects against… kidnapping and assassination… and also, of course, special services… like the demonstration we witnessed here today.
Excuse me, Mr Lennox.
Somebody needs to see you right away.
My assistant will answer any questions you might have.
Thank you all very much.
Ladies and gentlemen, are there any questions I can answer?
Are you equipped with night vision attack capabilities?
That was really, really great.
Well?
The answer is no.
Press, we got another fucking alien on the loose.
Get somebody else.
Come on, buddy.
Your country calls.
Don't start waving the flag.
I'm in the private sector now.
I've got a business to run.
Look at me, Press.
You know how I got this goddamn eye.
It's a sacrifice I'd make again in a heartbeat.
But then maybe you haven't learned the meaning of sacrifice.
Listen, pal.
The last time I fought with that alien she-bitch…
I almost got myself killed.
If the government was stupid enough to make another one…
I think they can clean up the mess by themselves.
We didn't make this one.
Count me out of the search party, okay?
Where is my fucking key?
A million dollars, tax free.
Sure you won't reconsider?
Welcome to Biohazard Four.
Dr Baker!
Come out here!
Oh, my God.
Open the doors!
Somebody open the doors!
Get him away from there!
Somebody open the doors!
What the hell do you think you're doing?
You know there's no men allowed in this lab. Get away!
–Calm down, Dr Baker.
–Do you have respect for this?
–Out now, both of you!
–We have an emergency.
Okay, we'll take it outside.
–Damn well right we'll take it outside.
–Don't blow a gasket.
Don't patronize me.
We're not patronizing.
We're coming along.
Close the doors.
Laura, correct me if I'm wrong.
Are you involved in this crazy bullshit?
Dr Baker runs this facility.
She cloned the Sil embryo.
Oh. Okay, well, what should I call her?
Sil Lite?
–Her name is Eve.
–Eve. How very biblical.
We have dampened her mating instinct.
We have strictly avoided the presence of testosterone in this lab.
At least until now.
Thank you for your help in that area.
What if she gets out of there?
She's electronically tethered to a control box.
One step off the premises, and a toxic capsule explodes in her brain.
You know, it's really great to see you again… and I was hoping we'd meet under better circumstances… but, I remember Laura Baker having a little bit more soul.
Just who the hell do you think you are?
You're coming into my lab, questioning my motives!
Are you two finished?
We have a national fucking emergency on our hands!
Now, you two will work together.
That's a direct order from the Pentagon.
You killed one of these fucking alien things before. Do it again.
You heard the man.
Now the fun begins.
I went over Orinsky's phone records, and this is the last place he called.
There's a patient named
Herman Cromwell.
Turns out he taught Orinsky at Stanford.
And what exactly is Cromwell doing here?
Well, that's the interesting part.
It's classified top-secret information.
I was doing research on a Mars meteorite.
The one found in the Antarctic in '96?
Fossils in the meteorite convinced us there might have been life on Mars.
But these fossils weren't anything organic to the planet. Oh, no.
And what was the basis for that determination?
Carbon-based elements in the fossils… exist only in the Magellanic galaxy.
That's 100 million light years away.
Well, how did they get to Mars?
By my reckoning…
Mars was visited by an alien species… approximately one billion years ago.
The species was like a plague, a cancer.
It turned a thriving planet with… rivers and oceans and rudimentary plant life… into a useless hunk of rock.
When I heard they were going to send a mission to Mars…
I strongly urged the government to reconsider.
On what grounds?
On grounds that alien DNA might remain on the planet… that any human attempt to violate the planet… would result in biological contamination.
So, let me guess. They told you to shove it up your ass.
They got me fired from Stanford.
It seems the military had strategic reasons for wanting to go to Mars.
Outpost of the future, or some crap like that.
Anyway, they harassed the shit out of me.
I got into a fistfight with a Pentagon general… and broke his goddamn jaw.
That's why they stuck you in here, right?
Why do you think that Dr Orinsky called you the night that he died?
To tell me I was right.
Whatever species destroyed Mars… those poor astronauts brought down to Earth.
May God have pity on our souls.
I'll tell you one thing.
For General Lee…
to be eatin' up the road this early in the mornin'…
something's sure got
Bo and Luke all head up.
I figure it's got somethin' to do with women.
Or huntin'.
Or maybe wheels.
The temperature on Mars is approximately 225 degrees below zero.
If they brought the samples on board, the temperature thaw… could have brought the DNA back to life.
That DNA could have infected the astronauts.
This isn't the fucking X Files, goddamn it!
You are following a lead based on the interrogation… of a certified nutcase.
We got one dead N. S. E. G. doctor… we have a guy who warned the government not to go to Mars… they slapped him in a loony bin… and a seven-minute time gap during the space flight.
We need to do blood analysis on Sampas, Gamble and Ross.
Now, I know that there is a sexual quarantine of ten days… on all interplanetary missions, and the Mars quarantine ends tonight.
They could fuck the human race into extinction.
You want to be responsible for that if we don't start testing everybody now?
Test Patrick first.
Yeah.
I've been waiting to get you alone.
All the interviews, all the screaming girls… all the hoopla… gone.
Push it out of your mind.
Patrick Ross… tonight… you're mine.
I love you.
What's the matter?
I don't know.
We should hold off.
Oh, no. No, you don't.
Not tonight.
Come on, Missy.
I don't feel so good.
Relax.
Let me do the work.
There's nobody here.
Where the fuck did he go?
Let's go find the others.
I missed you up there.
I missed you so much.
It's so beautiful.
Not as beautiful as you are.
Charmer.
Take it easy, Press.
You're gonna get us killed.
Trust me, Laura.
I got a bad feeling in my stomach.
God, I missed making love with you.
Oh, my stomach!
–Oh, my God!
–Call someone!
Call for help!
Up here. Come on!
No, please!
Oh, God.
I'm gonna get a full crew.
I'm gonna get 'em over here right away.
We gotta get to the others.
Oh, this is awful.
This is just awful.
I'll take her the rest of the way.
Have a good evening.
This is nice.
You thought I lived on a tugboat.
I know what you thought.
But I got it all under control now.
Oh, you do?
Yeah, you just slide right over there.
Let me open this door.
There we go.
Hey, girl.
–Is that it?
–No, honey, that's not it.
Right there.
No, that's not it.
Oh, that's it.
What's wrong?
Dennis Gamble, we'd like you to come with us.
Man, a brother just can't get no booty.
You know what I'm sayin'?
This is no way to treat a national hero.
This is embarrassing.
What is this all about?
Look, somebody speak to me.
Hey, I'm a personal friend of Senator Judson Ross, okay?
Personal friend. I'm gonna eat your badge for breakfast.
Get your hand off my head, man.
I demand an explanation.
We'll have the test results in a few minutes.
Why am I being tested?
N. S. E. G. said I was fine.
Sit tight, son.
We'll explain everything later.
Well, it's kind of tough to sit tight, sir.
I haven't been laid in 11 months.
That's unusual for me.
Take it easy, Burgess.
Everybody deserves an explanation.
You're damn right.
And what's with all these guards?
What the hell is going on around here?
It's purely a precautionary measure.
We need a couple of minutes for the blood analysis, so just relax.
Couple of questions.
What can you tell us about the seven minutes when the Excursion lost contact?
I can't remember.
I don't know if I blacked out,
I can't remember.
When did you last speak to Anne Sampas?
At that fund-raiser the other night.
Did she act peculiar?
She seemed fine to me.
What's this all about?
Something happen to her?
You tell me.
What happened to Anne Sampas?
Tell me what happened to her!
Anne Sampas is dead.
I'm sorry, Dennis.
Yeah. Laura.
Well, the combinant DNA in Anne's body doesn't match what I found in Orinsky's.
So, it's either Gamble or Ross.
Be careful, Press.
What was the cause of death?
We don't know.
Come on.
How the hell did she die?
Sequence almost complete.
–Why are you testing my blood?
–Ten seconds till relay.
–You think I killed Annie?
–Data retrieval on-line.
–Is that what you think?
–Five seconds. Three seconds.
I didn't kill her! I swear!
Computer says normal.
There is no sign of infection.
–Go home, get some rest.
–Look, I want answers!
In due time.
We'll be in touch.
Yo, Gamble.
You know where Patrick Ross is?
Nope.
Well, if you see him, you'll let me know, yeah?
Sure.
Well, let's see what the cranial cavity has to say.
Now I'll just reach behind her ear, and we should…
God.
Patrick, no!
Want a date, mister?
I was scared, man.
This is crazy.
His whole head just grew right back like some sort of damn freak show.
The alien species can regenerate living tissue.
Aliens, little green men.
I still can't believe it.
If they knew there were aliens up there, why did they send us?
N. S. E. G. got warned but they chose to ignore it.
We think that there was some hostile DNA in the soil samples that you collected.
Something happened up there.
I can't remember exactly.
I just know it was terrible.
I'm sure that it was terrible.
The question is:
How do we proceed now?
I got guys out there all over the place looking for this kid.
Any place he might be.
We're gonna find him sooner or later.
If he's reproducing, we've got potential offspring.
I think it's safe to assume he's banging cocktail waitresses two at a time.
Well, then in less than two weeks, these offspring reach adolescence… and then they enter the chrysalis stage.
Chrysalis stage?
A cocoon which turns them into adults.
Hey, baby, turn that car around.
Hey, don't leave me.
Come on.
Hi, honey.
Baby, come back.
A serial killer may be loose in the Washington-Maryland area.
Authorities have asked the public to be extremely cautious…
when approached by strangers.
How much for number three?
Twenty an hour.
Thank you, Linda.
And now for the financial news.
Twenty, forty, sixty.
Thank you much.
Enjoy yourself.
Come in.
See what I mean, Laura?
Every so often, her rates go berserk.
Fifty agents we got out there looking for this guy.
We got nothing.
Man, how can you just touch that?
Occupational hazard.
So, you didn't see nothing, didn't hear nothing, don't know nothing?
They come and they go.
You know what I mean?
They come and they go.
Oh, that's hysterical.
Sit your ass down.
They come, they go.
You get it?
Oh, yeah, I get it.
Here you go.
Thanks.
We're wasting time.
It's been two days, and Lennox hasn't made any headway.
Maybe that's because you gentlemen won't allow us to go public.
Dr Baker, you said that Eve has telepathic abilities.
Some.
Can we send her after Patrick?
It'd be foolish to take her out of a controlled atmosphere.
There's the danger of escape.
Then we'd have two aliens loose, instead of one.
If these two were to mate, the resulting pure strain of offspring… would be unstoppable.
Well, can she tell us where he is without leaving the lab?
We've seen spiking in her biorhythms… which indicate a rudimentary connection… but half her alien genes are dormant.
Tracking Patrick is out of her league.
Dormant means asleep.
Is there any way that we can wake them up?
We could use the lab's cyclotron… to bombard her with radiation that would awaken her dormant genes.
But there is a problem.
What's that?
We make her more alien.
We increase her strength, her anger.
Her mating drive would go through the roof.
It's worth the risk.
We'll tighten security.
She is not a lab animal.
She is half-human.
Please, Baker, spare us the alien rights agenda.
Put her in the cyclotron.
And what if I refuse?
That's your prerogative.
She's gonna go in anyway.
Gentlemen.
Don't worry, Laura.
I know what they want.
I'm sorry. This is not what I intended.
It's gonna be very painful for you.
I want to help.
I'm going to radiate for 45 seconds then shut it down.
I'm connected, Laura.
I see what he sees.
He's driving down a small street.
I see two-story buildings…
a man walking a small dog.
They're stopping at a stoplight.
Okay, here we go!
I see street signs.
Gwynn's Falls and Warwick!
–Intersection of Gwynn's Falls…
–He's in a parking lot!
–What?
–Gwynn's Falls and Warwick.
Gwynn's Falls?
Where?
That's in Reservoir Hill!
There's a big supermarket!
He's going into the supermarket near Gwynn's Falls and Warwick.
Hang on to your shorts!
–He's going after a woman!
–Let's go!
How the hell did you get a drivers' license?
Where is he?
Aisle one. Fruits and vegetables!
He's in aisle one, fruits and vegetables.
We're there. Now what?
Come on, Press!
My God! It's you!
–Will you sign my Space Flakes box?
–Sure.
You got a pen?
I do.
What's your name?
Darlene.
“Darlene.”
You know a secret?
I think Space Flakes taste like shit.
–Which row?
–Cereal!
Come on, Press.
Watch it!
Where's the goddamn cereal?
Nice to meet you.
Really nice to meet you.
It's her!
Help me!
Which way?
Quick! Which way?
What she say?
They're going down some stairs.
A basement! Find a basement!
It's dark.
He wants to mate with her!
Get away!
Get up!
Shut up!
Help!
Get down!
–Damn it!
–No!
Help!
He's trying to rape her!
Man, don't shoot!
Why don't you get a motel?
Fuckin' kids.
He knows I'm tapping in.
Help! Leave me alone!
Stop!
Get off me!
Eve…
Patrick!
Go on! Get out of here!
Get out!
–Don't move, spaceman.
–Put down the gun.
Get your hands up!
Get 'em up!
What is this?
You can't deny some bugged-out stuff going on around here.
What kind of stuff?
You told me yourself you were feeling weird.
You gotta go in for tests, bro.
Sure. I don't mind going into the lab.
Open the gate.
What's going on?
Estrogen level's peaking.
It's like she's in heat.
Let me out!
Let me out!
Let's go.
Has she been given any medication?
Yes, her usual dose.
Let me out, Laura!
I'm going to double it.
Let me out!
Listen to me, Laura…
Laura!
Code 459 alert. Patrick Ross in Biohazard Four. Seal the compound!
Get out of there, Sherry!
Patrick, leave her alone!
Open the door.
I know what you're going through, and I can help you.
–Let me help you.
–Open the goddamn door.
I can't do that.
I'm sorry.
–Open it!
–I can't…
Get away from her now!
The proof is incontrovertible.
Your son was infected up in that capsule.
I'm sorry, Senator.
Jesus God.
Rest assured we'll deal with this quietly.
Medical treatment, the best doctors.
The last thing this country needs is a spectacle with a national hero being publicly compromised.
Cut the crap, Carter.
What the hell are we gonna do?
Two imperatives:
We have to find Patrick and bring him in immediately.
We have to neutralize any possibility that this could leak to the media.
The generals are very concerned.
They're gonna kill him, aren't they?
We need to find your son.
You listen to me, you arrogant son-of-a-bitch.
If you touch a hair on his head… you will rue the day you were born!
You make it very hard to help you, Senator.
Go fuck yourself!
What the hell did you think I'd do?
Stand here and let you take my son?
I'll call the goddamn President if I have to.
Listen carefully, old man.
This is way beyond the President.
Way beyond.
You wanna save Patrick?
Help us bring him in.
Damn, man! What is up?
I can't even get no play from an alien.
Some people carry a disease in their genetic code.
The possibility exists it might be passed on to their children.
Those N. S. E. G. doctors told me I had sickle trait.
It's in your chart.
You don't have sickle-cell anemia, which is why you were able to go to Mars. But you're a carrier.
Right.
Well, I guess that's why he didn't get infected up on the ship.
Right. Alien DNA cannot cope with human genetic flaws.
It has no defense against our diseases, and that might be our answer.
What could be the answer?
Alien DNA infected us.
It's about time we infected them.
What?
Patrick…
Dad, what are you doing here?
I kind of figured you'd show up here.
You always used to love this place as a child.
So did your mother.
I never could convince her to get rid of it.
Yeah, I used to come here when I was courting her.
–And after she died…
–What do you want?
Well…
First off, I'd like to apologize.
Apologize for what?
Oh, Paddy.
Don't bother.
They told me what happened… how you got infected up on Mars.
I'm sorry, Paddy… for not listening when you asked for help.
You never listened.
I'm listening now.
They're gonna kill me.
Not if I can help it.
Now, there's no way that they can find you here.
This property's still listed under you mother's maiden name.
And I sure as hell am not gonna hand you over to those Pentagon bastards.
No, sir.
I'm taking you in to Johns Hopkins… for treatment with the best.
We'll walk through that door together.
Come in with me, son.
No.
I know you won't do it for me.
But try to think of your mother.
Do it for her.
Dad, help me.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Eve…
We need your help again to find Patrick.
I'm sorry, Laura.
I can't do that.
We could just call in the National Guard.
Sorry, pal.
This is strictly a private mission.
Yeah, well, I'm a lover.
I'm not a fighter.
You haven't been one of those in 11 months.
Why you gotta bring that up?
Okay, I was a lover. I sure as hell ain't no damned bounty hunter.
This looks about right.
What?
That little, old tiny ass thing?
You ain't got no bazookas up in here?
Bazookas?
Hasn't anyone ever told you that size doesn't matter?
I mean, you can talk all that noise if you want to.
I'm taking this because I'm about to go back to Africa on somebody's ass.
I've used Dennis' blood sample as the basis for this toxin.
Of course, I have no idea whether or not this is going to work.
It's an interesting idea.
It might be the only chance we got.
But what if it doesn't work?
Well, then, my friend, we're fucked.
Get the tether!
Containment breach.
We're locked in here!
Electronic tether, armed for activation
in five, four…
three, two, one.
It's stuck.
Get back!
Security breach, code red, level four.
Colonel, there's a lot of activity below.
Keep your distance.
Let's see what's going on.
Fire!
Come on.
Get in the humvees! Let's go! Now!
You heard him! Go!
How in the hell does she know how to drive?
Her favorite show's
The Dukes of Hazard.
Fan-fuckin'-tastic.
Burgess, this is General Metzger.
Maintain your pursuit but do not engage alien escapee.
Let Press Lennox do his job.
Is that clear?
Roger. Back off, Captain.
I don't wanna crash this party until just the right time.
Stop right here.
Grab that spray canister.
Be careful with that thing.
Jesus Christ!
Welcome to the maternity ward… from hell.
Patrick's offspring.
I'm gonna go up and see if I can find
Adam and Eve.
Press, this isn't Eve's fault.
She's human too.
Like them.
What's wrong?
My DNA ain't good enough?
You let me live on that ship so I can die in this goddamn barn?
Fuck you!
Fuck all you pig motherfuckers!
I'm about to get straight
Kunta Kinte on your ass!
Dennis!
It's working!
Score one for human DNA, baby!
Why don't you get those?
I'm going up here.
Just do your thing, baby.
Die!
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Eve, get out of the way!
What the hell is going on in here?
Stay back!
Oh, my God!
Eve, I know you're in there!
Please help us!
Please, help us!
Press!
Get up! Quick!
Quick!
You killed her, you disgusting son-of-a-bitch!
Press, use my blood! Quick!
Get up!
When did you start smoking?
Just now.
I wonder if I should have this stuff analyzed.
Yeah, maybe you should.
You might turn into a sexual predator.
–Yeah, I guess that's possible.
–It'd be okay with me.
I have a drag?
–All right, one, two, three.
–Up!
–Easy.
–Got it.
Oh, now y'all show up… after we do all the work.
I wanna talk to the general.
Know what I'm saying?
Mr Gamble,
I need you to lie back for me.
–Yes, I'll be glad to.
–Nice and easy.
Looks like you're gonna be all right.
I'm fine, brother.
Be seeing you.
I hear you had a rough day.
–Oh, I'm so glad you're here.
–Well.
I've been killing aliens all night.
Know what I'm saying?
All right. The fucking thing is loose.
It's out there.
The rescue team is on its way with guns and shit.
Right now there isn't any place that's real safe.
But we stay here, in the assembly hall.
This place never had any fucking air conditioning.
If it comes in, it's gotta be through one of these doors.
Now we post a guard to let us know if it's coming.
In the meantime,you lay low, be ready and stay right... in case your time comes.
Don't you start bullshitting, Dillon.
We're gonna be trapped in here like rats.
You got a weapon? You got a blade?
Then you take it out and fucking use it!
Oh, right. So you think we're gonna stab this motherfucker to death?
No, I don't think shit! Maybe.
Maybe you'll hurt it before it takes you out, huh?
Isn't that something?
Any of you got any better ideas?
And I'll tell you, until the rescue team gets here, we're fucked!
So you better get prepared.
Well, I ain't staying here.
Well, then, suit yourself.
Fire.
Furnace.
Yeah. Let's make it to the furnace.
Holy shit.
Well, all right.
Fuckin' "A."
- Fuckin' "A."
- Fuckin' right it's right.
It's up. What do you want to say?
Tell them the whole place has gone toxic.
Are you kidding?
Then they won't come here.
The rescue team will turn back.
- Yeah. I know.
- What are you talking about?
Our only hope is that they kill this fucker.
And maybe they can do something for you.
I don't know, freeze you-
They can do an operation.
They've got the technology.
If this organism gets off the planet, it'll kill everything.
The company doesn't care about that.
They just want it for their bioweapons division, okay?
So we can't let them come here.
Fuck you.
Look, I'm sorry you've got this thing inside you, but I'm getting rescued.
I don't give a shit about these stupid prisoners, but I've got a wife, a kid.
- I'll go home on the next rotation!
- I know. This is hard.
I'm gonna send this message back, and I need that fucking code.
I'm sorry, babe. It's classified.
Listen, you stupid little shit!
This has got to be done, okay?
- There are no alternatives!
- No way!
You're not getting it!
No fucking way!
Look, it's nothing personal.
Understand?
I think you're okay.
Thanks.
Have you got any ideas?
It won't kill me.
I'm carrying the new queen.
It won't kill its future.
- Do you wanna bet this thing's that smart?
- I don't know.
Maybe I'll go find it.
See how smart it is.
- You're gonna go and look for it?
- Yeah.
I have a pretty good idea of where it is.
It's just down there... in the basement.
This whole place is a basement.
It's a metaphor. Wanna come?
Fuck me.
Where are you when I need you?
Don't be afraid.
I'm part of the family.
You've been in my life so long...
I can't remember anything else.
Now do something for me.
It's easy.
Just-
Just do what you do.
Oh.!
It won't kill me.
- What are you doing? You're supposed to be laying low.
- I have one inside of me.
The big one won't kill its own.
- What are you talking about?
- I saw it... an hour ago.
I stood right next to it.
I could've been lunch, but it wouldn't touch me.
It ran away.
It knows I'm carrying its future.
Aw, bullshit. How do you know that thing's inside you?
I saw it... on the CAT scan.
It's a queen- an egg layer.
It can make thousands more like the one we've got here.
Still sounds like bullshit to me.
- If that thing's inside you, how'd it get there?
When I was in hypersleep, I guess.
I was violated.
Now I get to be the mother.
I don't have much time... and I can't do what I should.
I need you to help me.
I need you to kill me.
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- I'm dead anyway.
I can't survive it.
But the one inside of me can generate thousands more.
It can wipe out the whole universe.
It has to die.
So somebody's gotta kill me.
Are you up to it?
You don't have to worry about that.
No speeches.
No prayers.
- What's going on?
- I don't like losing a fight.
Not to nobody, not to nothing.
- That damn thing out there has already killed half my men... got the other half scared shitless.
As long as it's alive, sister, you're not gonna save any universe.
You said you were gonna kill me.
You fucking coward!
I want to get this thing, and I need you to do it.
And if it won't kill you, then maybe that helps us fight it.
Otherwise, fuck you!
Go kill yourself.
Dillon.
We waste this thing...
- then you take care of me.
- No problem.
Quick, easy and painless.
This is the choice.
You die sitting here on your ass... or you die out there.
At least we take a shot.
We owe it one.
It's fucked us up.
Maybe we can get even for the others.
- So how do you want it?
- What the fuck are you talking about?
I'm talkin' about killing that big motherfucker!
Hold it, hold it.
The rescue team's on its way.
We could just sit this out.
- A rescue team for whom?
- For us.
They just want the beast.
You know that.
I don't give a damn what they want.
They're not gonna pick us off one by one, are they?
- I wouldn't be so sure.
- Come on. They're gonna take us home.
They're not gonna take us home.
Still doesn't mean we should go out and fight it.
- Jesus Christ! Give us a break!
- You guys have got to be fucking nuts!
- I've got a wife and kid.
- Nobody gives a shit about you, 85.
You're not one of us.
You're not a believer.
- You're a fucking company man!
- Yeah, okay.
Okay, I'm a company man and not a fucking criminal.
You keep telling me how dumb I am.
I'm smart enough not to have a life sentence on this rock!
- Fuck you!
- Piss off, 85.!
And I'm smart enough to wait for some firepower to show up... before we fight this thing.!
- Right, Morse?
- Right. Okay. Just sit here on your asses. Fine.
How about if I sit here on my ass?
No problem. Oh, I forgot.
You're the guy that's made a deal with God... to live forever, huh?
And all the rest of you pussies can sit it out too.
Me and her'll do all the fighting.
Okay. But I want the same thing as you.
I want to see it dead. I hate the fucker!
They killed my mates too!
Why the fuck can't we wait for the company and have some guns on our side?
- Why do we have to go on some fucking suicide run?
- Right.
Because they won't kill it.
They might kill you just for having seen it.
But they're not gonna kill it.
That is crazy! That is horseshit!
They will not kill us!
When they first heard about this thing... it was crew expendable.
The next time they sent in marines.
They were expendable too.
What makes you think they're gonna care about a bunch of lifers... who found God at the ass end of space?
You really think they're going to let you... interfere with their plans for this thing?
They think we're- we're crud.
And they don't give a fuck about one friend of yours... that's- that's died.
Not one.
Have you got some sort of plan?
This is a lead works, isn't it?
All we got to do is lure the fucking beast into the mold... drown it in hot lead.
All right. So how do we do that?
Yeah. What are we gonna use for bait?
- Oh, fuck!
- We're all gonna die.
The only question is when.
This is as good a place as any... to take our first steps to heaven.
The only question is how you check out.
Do you want it on your feet... or on your fucking knees, begging?
I ain't much for begging.
Nobody ever gave me nothin'.
So I say fuck that thing!
Let's fight it!
Fuck it! Let's go for it!
- Let's kick its fucking ass.
- What if it runs at us?
That's a fucking good idea.
Two, one. Open.
When was the last time you used this place?
We fired it up five, six years ago.
You sure the piston's gonna work?
There's nothing for sure in this place.
We trap it here first, then you pull the lever.
Start the piston. The piston's gonna push the motherfucker right into the mold.
Then one of the guys will pour the lead.
End of his ass. End of story.
- What if somebody screws it up?
- We're fucked. You got one chance.
One shot at it. That's all.
We'll never have time to reset it.
Now remember, when you pull the lever... for a few seconds you're gonna be trapped in here with that fuckin'thing.
You guys don't drop the ball, I won't.
You just better be right about that thing not wanting you.
Because if it wants out, that's how it's gonna go.
Through that alcove, through you.
- Where are you gonna be?
- I'll be around.
- What about the others? Where are they?
- Praying.
- You believe in this heaven shit?
- I don't know.
Me neither.
Fuck it, though.
What else have we got to believe?
You can say that for fucking sure.
What the fuck.
Fellas! I can't he-
I don't know about this shit.
Hey, guys! My door ain't working!
- What the fuck's he saying?
- I think we'd better rethink this thing!
Aaah.!
Did anybody hear anything?
Come on!
Come and get me, you fucker!
It's behind me!
- It's started.
- It's still behind me!
It's in Channel "B"!
It's still coming! Shut the doors!
Must be heading over to Channel "A"!
This thing is really pissed off!.
- Did you say "B"?
- No, "E"!
- But you said we should stay here!
- Move your fucking ass!
Morse.
Kevin!
I think I found Vincent.
Yoo-hoo! Hey, fuckface!
Come and get me!
Take your best shot!
- Kevin, where are you?
- "A-7" closed.
Over in the east wing.
Door"B-7" safe!
Aaah!
- You too?
- Yeah! Okay. Over to "E," everybody!
- Where the fuck is "E"?
- This way!
Troy. Troy? Troy, help them.
Where the hell are they going?
What about the plan?
- Look, you're immune, they're not.
- So what are we doing?
Improvising.
We're improvising.
Here, here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
Here, kitty, kitty. Oh, my God.
Oh, my- You bastard!
It's coming! It's coming down!
Geez, it's coming!
It's onto us! Shut the fucking doors!
That was the plan!
Geez, it's on the fucking ceiling.!
Dillon! Anybody! This is not a drill!
Kevin! Gregor!
Where the fuck are you?
Now I'm back in "A"!
Shut. Come on.
Door 3, "F" Channel closed!
I hope.
Fuck!
- What the fuck are you doing?
- What?
- Don't hold it like that. Hold it like this.
- What the fuck-
- You'll fucking kill someone, you fucking moron!
- Ow!
Aaah!
- Morse.! Kevin.!
- Aaah.!
Gregor!
All they have to do is run down the damn corridor.
Stay here.
Where the hell is it?
Aaah!
It's coming.
Aaah!
No! Don't start the piston!
No! We have to trap it! No!
What are you doing? It's gone! No! No.
It's gone.
Okay?
Okay.
Aaah.!
- Aaah! Aaah!
- What the heck?
- Aaah.!
- All right!
Kevin! Don't struggle!
Don't move! No!
Don't struggle.
Come on. Come on, Kevin.
Come on!
Come on! Come on! Come on.
- The doors.
- It's coming!
Take the piston!
Come on. I got ya. It's all right.
It's okay. I got ya. It's okay.
It's all right, Kevin.
Kevin. Kevin.!
Leave him.
Leave him. He's dead.
We lured him.
Shit. How much time?
I'm not sure.
Four or five minutes.
But we've got to get it back in here before the piston seals this place off.
Now, let's move it!
- Help me!
- Jude!
Dillon.! Help me, Dillon.!
It's coming at me!
Goddamn it.!
Don't look back,Jude.!
Run as fast as you fucking can!
Help me!
God.! Please.! Help.!
Channel"C."
Jesus Christ!
Thank God you're here.
Warder Aaron, sir.
- Not many of us left, sir.
- Where is Lieutenant Ripley?
- Is she still alive?
- If she's alive, she's in the furnace.
She's in the lead works with the beast.
Wouldn't wait.
- Jesus Christ. You fucker.
Scared me shitless!
I thought you were the fucking beast. You fuck!
Aaah! Wanker!
Move. Come on, you bastard.
Come on.! Come on, get out of there.!
Come here.!
Ripley, we're running out of time!
Ripley, where are you?
No!
Come on. Get out of there!
- What are you doing? What the fuck is wrong with you?
- No! No!
- Let it go! Ripley!
- Yes! It's working!
- Scream.
- To the pistons.! No.!
Scream.! Let it follow us.
- Come on.!
- We got to get it in front of the piston.
Get back here.
It's following us!
Come on.! Motherfucker, come on.!
Come and get us.!
Come on.!
- Open the door!
- Come on. Come on.
Come on, motherfucker.! Come on.
Come on.! Get the door.!
- Get the door.!
- Morse!
- Now.!
- Shut it.!
Shut it, Morse!
Morse, shut that door!
- Now!
- Shut the fucking door.!
Shut it now.!
I'm going for the lead!
- Now! I'm staying.
- What about you?
Bullshit.!There's gonna be
10 tons of hot lead in there.!
- I'm telling you, I want to die!
- We got a deal!
Remember? It dies first, then you!
I'm not gonna move without you!
Now get going!
- Dillon!
- I've got to hold it here.
- What about me?
- God will take care of you now, sister!
No!
Pour the lead.
Fuck you.
Pour it, Ripley.!
Go on.! Goddamn it.!
Pour the lead, Ripley!
Pour it now!
Come on.! Come on.!
That's all you've got?
Is that all that you bite, motherfucker!
Come on!
Morse! Morse, over here!
- Ripley!
- Pour the lead!
Pour the lead!
- Aaah!
- Pour it!
All right, bug!
Ripley.! It's scalding hot.!
Hit the sprinklers.!
Douse the fucker.!
Gotcha!
Yes.!
- Don't come any closer.
- Wait. They're here to help.
Stay where you are.
- Ripley.
- Bishop.
- I'm here to help you.
- No more bullshit.
I just felt it move.
- You know who I am?
- You're a droid.
Same model as Bishop.
Sent by the fucking company.
No. I'm not the Bishop android.
I designed it.
I'm very human.
The company sent me here to show you a friendly face... to demonstrate how important you are to us-
- To me.
- You just want to take it back.
- We want to kill it and take you home.
- Bullshit.
You're wrong. We want to help.
What does that mean?
- We're gonna take that out of you.
- And keep it.
Can't allow it to live. Everything we know would be in jeopardy.
You don't want to take it back?
Ripley, time is important.
Let us deal with the mutant.
We've got a surgical bay set up on the rescue ship.
- Come with me.
- It's very quick.
Painless. A couple of incisions, you'll be out for two hours.
Then it's over.
You still can have a life.
Children.
And most important, you'll know it's dead.
Let me help you.
What guarantee do I have... once you've taken it out, you'll destroy it?
You'll have to trust me.
Please? Trust me?
No.
- What's this going to achieve?
- Aaah!
- Stop!
- Ow! Oh,Jesus!
Morse.
- Will you help me?
- What do you want me to do?
It was a mistake.!
There was no need for any of it.!
Fucking android!
I'm not a droid!
Ripley, think of all we could learn from it.
It's the chance of a lifetime.!
You must let me have it!
It's a magnificent specimen!
No pictures!
What are you doing?
No!
- Come on, you. Get going.
- Oh, fuck you!
Ash, Captain Dallas are dead.
Cargo and ship destroyed.
I should reach the frontier in about six weeks.
With a little luck, the network will pick me up.
This is Ripley... last survivor of the Nostromo... signing off.
I'm singing in the rain
Just singing in the rain
What a glorious feeling
I'm happy again
Whoa!
Let the stormy clouds chase
Everyone from the place
I'm laughing at clouds
So dark up above
The sun's in my eyes
And I'm ready for love
Come on, bring on that rain
I'm happy again
Come on with the rain
There's a smile on my face
I'm dancing with worms
Whoa!
A permit? Damn! How do you say "permit"?
I have a permit.
- Dr. Niko Tapopopolis?
- It's Tatopoulos.
Kyle Terrington.
I'm with the U.S. State Department.
- What are they doing?
- You're being reassigned.
My work here isn't finished.
It is now.
What did you see, old man?
That's affirmative.
Hey, where you going with my stuff?
Hello?
Hello. That's very delicate.
Thank you.
Dr. Niko Topodopeles?
- It's Tatopoulos.
- Whatever.
Get these people off the pier.
- Sir, what am I doing here?
- Watch your step and don't talk.
Get them off the damn pier!
- Is this some kind of spill?
- Something like that.
I work for the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission... but accidents and spills are not my field.
We know.
Do you know you've interrupted a study of the Chernobyl earthworm?
Yeah, you're the worm guy, right?
Radioactive contamination in that area has mutated the earthworm's DNA.
- You know what that means?
- No, but I'm about to find out.
It means that because of a man-made accident...
Chernobyl earthworms are now
17% larger than they were before.
17%, huh?
Sounds pretty big.
They're enormous.
That's what I'm trying to say.
I'm a biologist. I take radioactive samples and I study them.
That's great.
Here's your sample.
- Study it.
- What sample?
- You're standing in it.
- I don't see it.
Where is it?
I don't see it.
Colonel! Colonel!
That was a footprint!
I was standing inside of a footprint.
That's right.
There's no animal in the world that makes footprints like that, is there?
I told them this is not your field, but they never listen to genius.
Nick, this is Elsie Chapman of the National Institute of Paleontology.
She's your boss.
- Those were footprints, right?
- Yes, they were.
- Anybody see what made them?
- Actually, no such luck.
It happened so fast, nobody knew what hit them until it was over.
- Elsie?
- Yeah?
Tape's in.
The French finally released it.
This is a Japanese cannery ship that was attacked and sunk near French Polynesia.
We believe it's connected.
Dr. Craven, have you met the "worm guy"?
Oh, sorry. Summer cold.
Come on, come on ! All right?
Have a nice day.
Oh, wait, wait, wait!
- It's supposed to rain all week.
- What's with the bags?
Caiman's groceries.
Oh, girl!
- Speak of the devil.
- What?
This is the midget version. This makes me look like a trained professional.
Can we put this on the 5:00, please?
- Think I should ask him?
- No!
- I'm gonna ask him.
- No!
- I will.
- Audrey.
- Did you talk with Humphries?
- This is not the place.
- Tell me. Did you talk with him?
- He's considering you and Rodriguez.
You serious? He's gonna consider me for the job? What else did he say?
Why don't we talk about it over dinner tonight? Your place.
You're married.
Yes, and you're beautiful.
Have I told you before?
Mr. Caiman !
I've been doing research for you after hours and weekends for over three years.
This is a very important job to me.
I'm too old to be your assistant. I need to know this job is going someplace.
So, have dinner with me tonight.
I can't.
It's your choice.
- Okay, let's go.
- Charlie?
Say hello to your new co-anchor,
Ms. Desireé Pon.
Welcome aboard.
- Mark, can I have a pillow, something?
- In five. Four.
Three. Two.
Hello, New York. At 5:00 we'll ask
Fat Pat, "When will this rain end?"
So three years digging up worms in Chernobyl?
How did Mrs. Tata-polis handle that?
It's Tatopoulos.
I'm not married.
Really? A girlfriend?
No. Perhaps I work too much.
There's no one who holds a special place in your heart?
No. Not for a long time now.
You may be the wrong man for the job... but I think you're cute.
Oh. Thank you.
She thinks I'm cute.
Who are they?
Get those people out of there.
- They're with me.
- Is that right?
- Who are you?
- Casualty and Property Insurance.
- We're preparing our report.
- You're damn fast.
That's our job.
Your people are getting in the way of my job.
What could've done this?
Mr. Roaché, get your people out of here... or I will.
- Captain's getting a cup of coffee.
- Don't take too long.
- Then he'll come and kick your ass.
- Yeah ! I'm in for a buck.
What is that dope-head doing?
Artie!
- Artie, why are we slowing down?
- I don't know. She's at full throttle.
Maybe she's heavy in the net.
Yo! How come we stopped?
Are the nets full?
I don't think so.
We must be caught on something.
Bring in the nets.
Pull 'em in now.
- What's going on?
- We're bringing them in !
The engines are heating.
- Should I shut them down?
- No! Keep pulling!
Come on! Bring 'em!
I'm trying. I'm trying!
Cut 'em loose! Cut the net!
Look out!
Cut loose now!
Hurry! Hurry!
Jump!
Abandon ship!
Let her go!
You hear that?
Excuse me, sir. Got a report of three fishing trawlers going down.
- What makes you think it's related?
- The trawlers were pulled under, sir.
Jesus Christ!
It's 200 miles off the Eastern American seaboard and we don't know what it is.
- It's Theropoda Allosarus.
- What?
Some type of enormous reptile we believe died out in the Cretaceous Period.
Where's it been hiding the last 60 million years?
What about the traces of radiation?
The radiation isn't an anomaly.
It's the clue.
This animal is much too big to be some kind of lost dinosaur.
Don't tell me what it isn't, tell me what it is.
What do we know?
It was first sighted... off the French Polynesian Pacific, right?
That area has been exposed to dozens of nuclear tests over the past 30 years.
Hence the radiation.
No, more than that.
I believe this is a mutated aberration.
A hybrid caused by the fallout on these islands.
Like your earthworms?
Yes. Yes.
We're looking at a completely incipient creature.
The dawn of a new species.
The first of its kind.
My lite sucks.
Oh, please! Your lite doesn't suck.
- His lite sucks.
- 'Cause I'm married to you.
I cannot believe he put the moves on me after everything I've done for him.
He is scum! As far as he's concerned, you're a pair of breasts that talk.
Hey, there's an image.
He is dirt!
He's a douche bag, gutter slime, dog crap, puke chunks.
You don't see I'm eating?
Audrey, you're too damn nice.
That's your problem.
Nice gets you nothing in this town.
It's dog eat dog. You gotta be a killer to get ahead. Know what I'm saying?
I'm sorry, baby, but you just don't got what it takes.
- Do you think that's true, Animal?
- Pretty much.
You're a nice person.
Nice guys finish last.
- I can be tough if I want.
- Yeah, sure.
I can!
- I can.
- No, yeah.
Whatever.
Oh, my God!
Could you turn that up, please?
- It's Nick!
- Who is he?
He was my college sweetie.
He looks so handsome on TV.
There seems to be an unusually tight security around the crash site... possibly because of the highly sensitive military cargo on the plane.
Fellas, you want to unload this, please?
I'm getting soaked!
Come on, will ya?
Joe, gonna catch one of them little fish in the East River?
I hope so.
You never know.
I mean, today could be my lucky day.
The only thing you're gonna catch is a cold!
I got a bite!
Boy, do I have a bite!
Hold on, Joe. You got a big one, baby.
Hold on to it now.
You wanna fight?
Here he is, ladies and gentlemen, the man you've all been waiting for.
Yours for a safer New York.
Your mayor, Mayor Ebert!
Thank you!
I want to thank all of you for coming on this beautiful New York City day!
When I first came into office four years ago... people didn't think that I would reduce crime.
But I did!
Oh, my God!
Move it! Let's get out of here!
I am grateful we're getting a new set.
It represents a commitment on the part management.
What I don't understand is why we're the only station... that doesn't have the Korean grocery holdup as our lead.
What's our lead?
Rain ! Again!
Mom?
Sorry. I don't give a rat's ass about a war... in some country whose name
I can't even pronounce!
How about a real story?
Sir, I think your story just walked by the window.
What?
Maybe we can get in the Korean grocer's hospital room.
Did this Romeo have a name?
Nick Tatopoulos.
- Jesus! Is that why you dumped him?
- No.
How long did you guys go out, anyway?
Nearly tour years.
Girl, I'm surprised he didn't ask you to marry him.
That's the problem.
He did.
Tell me that's not another parade.
I don't think that's a parade.
Please stand by.
What the hell is that?
Are you all right?
Are you cut?
Victor!
- Don't be stupid!
- Oh, my!
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!
That is really--
That is large.
Oh, my God!
Come on, you bastard!
Jeez!
Victor, get back here, you retard!
Somebody do something!
Sergeant O'Neal, sir!
Any word from the mayor's office?
Yes, sir. They've agreed to evacuate the city and called out the National Guard.
Wait. Evacuate Manhattan?
That's over three million people.
- Has that been done before?
- I don't think so.
- Where is he now?
- We lost sight of it, sir.
You want to run that by me again?
After its initial attack... he disappeared.
Secretary of Defense Burk is on the line.
I don't understand. How could something so big just disappear?
- We're not sure, but we're scanning--
- He probably returned to the river.
I don't think so.
I mean, look at it.
It's perfect.
An island, water on all sides, but like no other island in the world.
This is a place where he can easily hide.
He's in there someplace.
Channel 12 caught it on tape.
Hello. I'm Charles Caiman in the WIDF News Center.
Ladies and gentlemen, we New Yorkers like to think... we've seen it all, but what you will see will shock you beyond belief.
This is footage we have that indicates... that there is a dinosaur loose in Manhattan.
WIDF's exclusive footage was shot barely half an hour ago.
WIDF cameraman Victor "Animal" Palotti survived unharmed.
Great stuff, Animal.
Weren't you scared?
Yeah. Thought Lucy was gonna kill me.
Damn right, you crazy wop!
Okay, people, we have to be completely relocated... to the New Jersey station for the 10:00 broadcast.
Animal!
You're riding in the chopper with Caiman. Let's go. Lift off.
You going to be all right?
Audrey's going to spend the night with us.
Cool. A threesome. That's excellent.
I'm a little tired--
Dozens of people are reported killed, thousands of others injured.
Civil defense stations are being set up throughout Manhattan.
In addition, city, military... and health officials are setting up a command post... on the Jersey shore in anticipation of an evacuation.
My bag. My bag!
Mr. Caiman, wait.
I've got a lead.
- I know a guy who's on the inside.
- Not now.
You don't understand.
I can get us inside information.
This is when the big boys go to work.
Okay, honey? Bag.
This is crazy! Come on, let's go.
Wait up.
- Can we get a cab?
- Audrey, what are you thinking?
Go, go!
In what city officials are describing as the worst act of destruction... since the World Trade Center bombing... hundreds of thousands of people have jammed the streets... in the largest evacuation in this city's history.
And many people, many, many people are not happy about it.
Among those unhappy citizens are the managers of the stores... along pricey Fifth and Madison Avenue.
The Warner Bros. and Disney stores have been cleared out by looters.
And the streets are jammed.
Traffic is at a standstill.
Emergency vehicles cannot have access to any emergency that may develop.
And there is a slow but steady stream out of the city... as if Long Island or New Jersey were any refuge in this time of crisis.
This is great!
If I'm wrong on this evacuation, they'll string me up from the Liberty torch.
Didn't we agree that we weren't to have any sweets until after the election?
Back off, Gene.
- Mr. Mayor.
- Who are they?
Building owners and business people from the community.
- I don't have time for this nonsense.
- Campaign contributors!
Ladies and gentlemen,
I share your concerns.
I want to get this city back in business as soon as possible. Please.
La Rochelle Insurance. We represent
13%% of the buildings in your city.
You can count on our emotional and financial support.
Thank you.
What do you plan to do?
- Coming through.
- Where's your I.D.?
- What's the matter?
- You need press I.D.
I've got l. D.
I had a badge on my bag.
I don't know if this is a good idea.
What are you talking about?
You stole it.
Finally you got a little chutzpah.
Don't wimp out on me.
What if Caiman finds out?
How often will you have an ex-boyfriend on the inside of a major story?
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
If I could just stick this thing.
You got any glue?
I'm sorry. I left my forgery kit at the office.
No croissant?
Ah, you call this coffee?
I call this America.
I'm sorry, Mr. Mayor, but that's where we are.
Now hold on. Hold on.
You're saying that in an election month
I've evacuated this city for nothing?
Do you realize what this evacuation will cost the people of this city?
We have been monitoring the waters around the island.
- As far as we can tell, it hasn't left.
- But you don't know for sure.
We have a strong reason to believe it may be hiding... inside one of the buildings within the restricted area.
- But you don't know for sure!
- Mr. Mayor.
We cannot give the "all clear" until each building has been checked.
- What is it?
- Excuse me, sir.
That may be more difficult than we originally projected.
Terrific! More good news.
We've run into a problem.
- Do you believe this?
- I don't know what's going on.
- You never know what's going on.
- Thank you.
- Here, sir.
- Fall in.
Let's go, people.
Fall in downstairs.
Lieutenant Anderson and his men found this this afternoon.
We were checking the office building above when we found the floor was gone.
When we discovered he could burrow through the tunnels, we realized... he could be outside the quarantine zone.
Holy Christ!
How many tunnels lead off the island?
Only 14. We've checked them all.
He hasn't used any of them.
- Have them all sealed up.
- Yes, sir.
How? How would we do that, sir?
Fill them with cement. Brick them up.
Put land mines in them, bombs.
I don't care! Make sure the damn thing doesn't leave the island!
Yes, sir.
You know, he's not some enemy trying to evade you.
- He's just an animal.
- What are you suggesting?
When I had to catch earthworms... the best way to get them was not to dig them out, but to draw them out.
All we need to do is to find out what he needs... and he'll come to you.
Where are they now?
Delta Niner, what is convoy position?
Command, they have just entered the city.
I have no radio contact with the convoy.
I'm expecting ground confirmation now.
- Convoy ETA ten minutes, sir.
- We've got to hurry.
Man your positions now.
Ten minutes to ETA.
Go, go, go!
All systems go!
Is it good?
Let's go! Come on, coming through!
Put it down.
You said this was French Roast!
More cream.
Bring 'em in!
Bring 'em back.
I hope this plan of yours works.
I'm hoping that myself.
- Did you give approval for this?
- They just appropriated it.
Twelve city dump trucks? Would you like to tell me what's going on?
Actually, no, I wouldn't.
And don't touch anything.
- How's O'Neal doing?
- Everything is on schedule.
- You sure you didn't know about this?
- No one told me anything.
Why do I keep you around?
Dump!
Very clever.
Let's pile it on and let's get out of here.
That's a lot of fish.
Come on, you bastard, it's supper time.
Look at all that frigging fish.
Is this gonna work?
We gotta get these manholes uncovered.
We want him to smell the bait.
Come on !
Let's go! Let's go!
Come on, guys.
Get those lids off. Go!
What the hell is he doing?
Okay, this way.
- Come on.
- You heard him. Let's go.
Come on! Over there!
This one.
Give me the crowbar.
Set up here.
It's your best shot.
This is 6-Alpha Charlie.
We can't stay put!
We gotta move!
We need bigger guns.
- We've lost communications.
- Get us back on-line.
Fire at will !
- Fire at will.
- Fire, fire!
O'Neal, what the hell is going on?
He's gone, sir.
Echo unit in pursuit.
Follow my lead.
- All systems armed.
- Echo 4 armed.
We're doing 80 knots, and he's pulling away, sir.
I've got him locked on.
- Target is locked on, sir.
- Fire the damn missile.
- Echo, fire at will.
- Fire sidewinders.
Damn!
That is a negative impact.
I repeat, that is a negative impact.
- Negative impact, sir.
- Negative impact?
That's the goddamn Chrysler Building.
He had it locked on.
We had you locked on.
The heat seekers can't lock, sir.
He's colder than the buildings.
Freddie!
- What?
- Let's go before we get caught.
Jimmy, you know that bad feeling I get when something bad is going to happen?
- Yeah.
- I'm getting that feeling right now.
Descend to 300 feet.
All systems armed.
Descend to 300 feet.
All systems armed.
Target, 11 :00.
Where'd he go?
Echo Flight, get it together, guys.
Prepare to fire.
Echo 4, ready.
Echo 2, ready.
Fire!
I think we got him.
- We've lost Echo 1 and 2, sir.
- God!
Echo 4, where is target?
Jesus! He's right on my tail, sir!
I can't shake him!
Oh, I think I lost him.
We've lost Echo 4, sir.
What the hell is the matter with you?
You've caused more damage than that goddamn thing did!
-Calm down. Have some candy.
-I don't want any candy! Leave me alone.
I can't believe it.
He did all of this and we did nothing to him.
That's not true.
We fed him.
Here at Command Center in New Jersey there is no new information to report... because the military has clamped a total media blackout... on whatever is going on out here.
Officials are not saying anything about their attempts to contain... or control this creature.
Okay, the situation is under control !
It is under control.
We have containment.
Don't wait for me. I'm okay.
- Can I help you, young man?
- Yes.
Do you have any at-home pregnancy tests?
Especially ones that look for gonadotrophic hormones... or clomiphene citrate?
I don't know.
This is all we've got.
I'll take all of them.
You must have some harem.
Oh, my God. Is that you?
What are you doing here?
Hi. Hello.
- Wow. How much is that?
God, you look-- Wow!
- How have you been?
- It's good to see you, Nick.
- So you made it.
- What?
You're a reporter.
That's good.
That's what you always wanted.
I'm happy for you.
Really. I am.
Thank you.
You're still mad at me?
Well, you left without a phone call, letter, nothing, all this time.
Yeah. I guess I am still a little mad.
That was eight years ago.
Some people change.
Most people don't.
I'm sorry you feel that way.
You're right.
Eight years is a long time.
Can I make you a cup of tea?
Sure. That'd be nice.
I still can't believe it.
How does a guy go from anti-nuke activist... to working for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission?
When you and I went to rallies together in college... we helped to create awareness.
But now, from the inside...
I'm able to effect real change.
And exactly what changes are you trying to effect?
I'm preparing a census for the government.
I'm cataloging new species created as a result of nuclear contamination.
- Is that what you think created this?
- Yeah. I found a blood sample earlier.
- How close did you get to the thing?
- I got pretty close.
What else did you find out?
We know he eats tons of fish.
He's amphibious.
He's a burrower.
And... he's pregnant.
He is?
He! A very unusual he.
Obviously these tests weren't designed for this... but fundamentally they look for the same hormonal patterns to indicate pregnancy.
I don't get it. It he's the first of his kind, how can he be pregnant?
Doesn't he need a mate?
Not if he reproduces asexually.
Where's the fun in that?
I kept thinking, why would he travel so tar?
But it makes perfect sense.
Lots of animals travel great distances for reproduction.
That's what he's doing in New York.
He's nesting.
- Nesting?
- Yes.
Do you realize that a lizard can lay... up to 12 eggs at a time?
- Think of it.
- I didn't know that.
Forgive me.
I have to get this to the lab... see it I can confirm all this.
I'll be right back.
Come on, Joey.
There's nothing down here.
I'm telling you, man,
I heard something.
You heard nothing.
It's a dead end.
Anything?
No. Nothing down here.
Nothing at all.
This is why, in this case, all the king's horses and all the king's men... may not be able to put the Big Apple together again.
Audrey Timmonds. WIDF News.
- Yes!
- That's it. You owe me a beer.
You like it?
I should've worn my hair back.
- No, it looks great.
- You liked it? Good.
Can I ask you something?
How did you get ahold of this material?
It's like you said.
"Nice guys finish last."
- Thank you. I love you.
- Yeah, sure.
Murray!
Come here a second.
Hold on a second?
What is it?
I've got exclusive footage of other places this thing has attacked.
You do?
Whose story is that?
Mine.
If we can lure him into a more open area such as this portion of Central Park...
I think we can take him down.
Last time you didn't even scratch it.
That's not true. Our worm guy,
I mean Dr. Tatopoulos, has found blood.
Yes, I did.
We need to get him out into open terrain... and use weapons that don't rely on heat-seeking technology--
Excuse me, sir. I think this situation has become more complicated than that.
The blood that I collected... revealed that the creature is either about to lay eggs or already has.
Are you trying to tell us that there's another one of those things out there?
No, Governor.
I don't believe so.
Wait a minute.
Then how can it be pregnant?
What is this, the virgin lizard?
No. It reproduces asexually.
That's why we have to find the nest as soon as possible.
Otherwise up to a dozen are going to be born... each one capable of laying eggs on its own.
Very quickly we could be looking at an enormous population.
After we kill the creature, then we'll search for the nest.
I think it might be too late by then.
These eggs will hatch very quickly.
How do you know?
The fish that we found on the subway.
He's not collecting all this food just for himself.
He's preparing to teed his young.
Stay tuned for our special report.
Would you excuse us, please?
Where you been?
They just promo-ed your spot.
It's up right after this.
Turn it up?
Yo! Can you turn it up, please?
The TV!
If Dr. Tatopoulos is right, we must act quickly before this problem escalates.
So you want to divide our efforts based solely on some wild theory?
Sir, Nick's come through for us before.
If he feels--
Come through for you?
Colonel, your campaign's a disaster.
You weren't even able to keep this thing from coming to Manhattan.
Excuse me, gentlemen, but I think we should see this.
Look at the methods and motivations of Manhattan's newest unwanted pest.
Godzilla.
That's what Japanese sailors called him in song.
A mythological sea dragon who filled their hearts with fear.
- He stole my report!
- I know.
That myth has become reality, our modern-day terror.
I don't believe it!
Who is this Godzilla?
Where did he come from? Why is he here?
And it's Gojira, you moron !
A direct path can be traced from Manhattan to French Polynesia... where nuclear tests have been going on for more than two decades.
Research team member
Dr. Nick Papadopoulus believes.... the creature may be nesting... using Manhattan as ground zero to cultivate the species.
This despite the fact that the combined might... of the United States military has been unable to subdue--
You went to the press with this?
- No! I haven't talked to anyone.
- They mentioned you by name!
Yeah. Yeah !
You gave them the tape?
No, I didn't give them the tape.
It's in my tent right now.
Oh, my God! She took it.
Pack your stuff, mister. You're officially off this project as of now!
We're leaving.
I'm so sorry.
Make sure that Hicks finds that nest before it's too late.
I'll try.
He's not there? A second ago you told me he was on the other line.
Please. It's urgent. I really need to talk to him. Yes, Nick Tatopoulos.
You're leaving?
Why?
Is it 'cause of me?
'Cause of the story?
What did you think was going to happen?
You never said it was off the record.
I shouldn't have to. You were supposed to be my friend. I trusted you.
There's something I have to tell you.
I lied to you.
I'm not a reporter.
When we broke up, and I first came out to New York...
I was so sure I'd make it.
But I haven't.
That's why I needed the story so bad.
I couldn't tell you
I'm a failure.
And you thought that made it okay to steal my tapes?
It was a terrible thing to do.
I never should've done that.
Good luck with your new career.
I really think you have what it takes.
Newark Airport.
I'm sorry.
Yo! Give her a break, will ya?
Excuse me, is this the best way to the airport?
Sir, where are you going?
Hello?
Okay, stop.
Stop the car right now!
Let me out of here!
I'm afraid I can't do that.
I know you, don't l?
Yeah, you're that insurance guy.
Agent Philippe Roaché, D.G.S. E.
Direction Générale des Securité Extérieure.
Sounds big.
The French Secret Service.
Your American friends have decided not to look for the creature's nest.
What? Are you sure?
How do you know that?
- We know. Trust me.
- Trust you?
You hijack me and you expect me to trust you?
- Yes.
- Why should l?
Because you are the only one who wants to find the nest as much as I do.
How did you get all this stuff into the country?
This is America.
We can buy anything.
Why all the secrecy? Why aren't you working with the U.S. military?
I'm not permitted to speak of such things.
You said you needed my trust.
Then I need yours.
I am a patriot. I love my country.
You understand that?
Sure.
It is my job to protect my country.
Sometimes I must even protect it from itself... from mistakes we've made.
Mistakes we don't want the world to know about.
- The nuclear tests in the Pacific?
- Yes.
This testing done by my country left a terrible mess.
We're here to clean it up.
We know how to get into the city.
We just don't know where to start looking.
Here. This is the 23rd Street subway station.
That's where we first found the fish.
That'd be a good place to start.
So you're in?
Yeah. Yeah, I'm in.
I always wanted to join the French Foreign Legion.
- Hello.
- How's it going?
Excuse me. Pardon me.
Sorry.
- Honey?
- Hi, sweetie.
- Who are all these people?
- What?
I couldn't just let them sleep on the street.
Where's Audrey?
In the bedroom crying her eyes out because of you.
What did I do?
That "you gotta be vicious" stuff you tilled her head with.
- Get out of here!
- Go talk to her right now.
I was agreeing with you.
Excuse me.
Contrary to frivolous reporting... we have absolutely no information whatsoever to make us believe... that there are any eggs of the creature in the city.
There's no need for panic.
Repeat. There's no reason to panic.
It's all my fault.
What have I done?
What have I become?
Look at me. This isn't me.
I don't do stuff like this.
You made a mistake. It happens.
Well, I totally screwed up with the only man who will ever care about me.
If I told you you could make it all up, would you?
Of course I would.
So get this.
After he left you in the street,
I kinda followed him.
Figured I'd talk some sense into the guy, you know?
Next thing I know, he pulls into this warehouse... with all these French wackos in military outfits.
They want to sneak back into the city tonight.
They're going after the nest.
If he finds it, I think you should be the one that lets the world know... that this guy was right all along.
You want me to follow him into the city?
Yeah. We both will.
Come on. It'll be fun.
I don't know. I've already made such a mess of everything.
Yeah, you did, Audrey.
I'm goin' after him.
You can come with me or not. Okay?
What are you doing?
Can't let Lucy know.
She'll hurt me.
What's with the gum?
Makes us look more American.
Really?
Just let me do the talking.
All right?
It's not in gear.
Follow me. This way.
- You okay?
- I'm okay.
- Come on.
- What is this place?
It's a vent that leads to the subway tunnels underneath here.
It should take us to the 23rd Street station in Manhattan.
You've got to be kidding me.
Aren't there rats and stuff down here?
I'm more concerned about lizards at this point.
Big, ugly, nasty, large lizards.
Who you with?
We're with the 3-2, sir.
I didn't ask you, soldier!
Sergeant O'Neal just called down for us.
He wants us to join him now, sir.
Thank you.
- You got a problem talkin'?
- No, sir. I'm tine.
Let's go!
Keep it movin'.
Thank you very much.
Elvis Presley movies.
He was the King.
Sir, O'Neal on-line.
Do you read me?
Call for O'Neal!
How are we doing?
So tar so good.
We're right on schedule.
We're good.
We're good.
- Oh, my God!
- Yeah. There they are.
Kill your light.
How do we get down there?
We're gonna lose them.
- How did they get down there?
- I don't know.
You don't think they climbed down this thing?
Jesus!
Careful.
- Gimme your hand.
- I got you.
The gutter.
- Do you hear that?
- What?
Animal, come on!
I guess we go this way.
Sir, we spotted him in section 5.
Combat positions! Here we go.
Combat!
Target's heading north to section 5.
Do not fire until he has cleared the buildings and enters the park.
Wait until he enters the park.
Come on.
He's leaving!
Fire away!
Damn!
Fire!
Raven Flight. Evasive maneuvers.
Target is in the clear. He's headed toward the Westside Highway.
Don't worry. The navy has something waiting for him.
- Stations manned for battle station.
- At ordered depth, sir.
We've got him on sonar.
Utah closing in.
Make final preparations.
Prepare to fire.
Manned and ready.
Torpedo room reports manned and ready.
- Final bearing in chute.
- Are we locked on?
- Are we locked on?
- Aye, sir.
- Locked on, Captain.
- Number one, stand by. Fire.
Torpedo 1 left the tube.
Indiana and Anchorage closing in.
- What's the status?
- We're locked on and closing in.
Fire one.
- The target's heading right at us!
- All back full.
Aye, sir. All back full.
Stand by for impact in ten seconds.
Six. Five.
Four. Three.
Two. One.
We've lost the Anchorage, sir.
He's shitted course.
He's heading back towards Manhattan.
Full ahead. Close in and lock on.
Prepare tubes 3 and 4 and lock on.
- Stand by, 3. Fire.
- Torpedo 3 left the tube.
Impact in eight seconds.
Seven. Six.
Three. Two. One.
- Direct hit!
- Got him.
Congratulations, sir.
Good job.
Well done.
Good job.
What's up there?
This is a good smell.
Yeah.
Look at this.
He trashed the Garden.
Oh, man!
Now I'm pissed.
Is that them?
Yeah.
Three eggs.
I thought there'd be more.
And you were right.
Oh my! Wow!
There's gotta be more than 20 eggs here.
Way more!
Start counting.
- Could you help me?
- You all right?
What the hell are they doing?
We have a problem.
Oh, my God! God!
Come on, let's go.
One second, all right?
This is unbelievable.
- Don't we have enough already?
- I just want--
That's good for me.
That's plenty.
We should-- Let's--
Let's not startle him.
We smell like the fish.
- I think we should leave now.
- I think that's a good idea.
Run! Come on!
- Everybody outside now!
- Come on, quickly!
Lock the doors now!
We have to keep them contained inside.
Come on, let's go!
- You see that?
- On three.
Three!
This is where the Knicks get showered and everything.
Now what do we do?
I'm standing just outside the
Jersey entrance to the Lincoln Tunnel... where thousands of angry refugees are demanding to be let back into the city.
All major arteries into the city are clogged with jubilant Manhattanites.
Yes, I understand.
- Your office is swamped with calls.
- I know.
Do you have any idea what's going on out there? Phones are ringing off the hook.
People are screaming to be let back into the city.
We're sending divers in to retrieve the body.
What are you waiting for?
Colonel, we've got to start a search for the nest.
We've been through this already.
What if Nick is right and we blow this whole thing?
This could be the only chance we have to do something about it.
Captain, organize a search party.
I want a sweep of the entire city and the subway.
You don't have the authority to do that.
Try and stop me.
Contact the military.
Get them to send a bomber to blow up this building.
- How do I do that?
Tell them it's a Code Dragonfly.
That should get you through.
What are you waiting for?
- 555 what?
- All circuits are busy right now.
- It's busy.
Try again!
What did they say?
I can't get through.
I don't know what's wrong.
We secured the doors.
- Where is Jean-Philippe, Jean-Pierre?
- They didn't make it.
My men and I will hold them here.
You'll have to go and get help.
Can we tit up there?
Only one way to find out.
Boost me up.
This is not good.
Come on.
Come on.
Wrong floor.
Why don't we go this way?
- It's me. It's me.
- What happened?
They're loose. They're all over the place. I couldn't get out.
- Who are you?
- Audrey!
Here.
- You all right?
- I think so.
No cameras.
Yeah, all right.
Very good.
Do you have a radio, walkie-talkie, anything to contact the outside?
- What about the phones?
- It's no good. Circuits are jammed.
Wait. I know a way. I know how we can get a message to the outside.
This way.
The tape!
Come on !
Come on.
- The broadcast booth is over here.
- How do you know that?
Our network covers the Rangers games.
- It's locked.
- Wait. There's a code.
Come on !
I was just about to get it.
The network is on an intranet. It's a direct teed into our computer system.
Your station won't have an easier time reaching the military than I did.
Did they monitor all the news broadcasts?
Yeah, they did.
All right, we'll go live.
We'll broadcast right from in here.
Hopefully they'll see it.
I'll try to get a message through.
Let's not forget in our rush to return to the city... that many people have had their lives changed forever.
No one in the city has been untouched by the tragedy.
The sick, the displaced, the injured--
There's no Ranger game on tonight.
Ed, if you're seeing this, will you please put us on live?
It's urgent.
I know this sounds crazy, but you have to do it.
Trust me.
I'm not putting you on live.
- I don't think he'll do it.
- Yes, he will.
All right, Ed? Come on!
See that? They'll be all over the city if we don't stop them.
Give me a second.
The time has come to return to our homes and pick up our lives.
- These are the last three.
- Our fears have been allayed.
Thanks to the heroic efforts of our boys in uniform--
Are we on?
This calculator--
Yeah, you're on.
Yes, you're on. Go!
We're live inside
Madison Square Garden... where Dr. Niko Tatopoulos has discovered the beast's lair.
Doctor, can you tell us what's happening here?
- That's you, yes. Go, go.
- Thank you.
Well, we've discovered over 200 eggs.
Go get Hicks.
Which a few moments ago began hatching.
The creatures just hatched are over nine feet tall, and they've begun feeding.
When their food supply runs out here... they will attempt to hunt down food of their own outside of this nest.
Oh, my God!
If they get out, they'll multiply and soon a new species will emerge.
One that could replace us as the dominant species of this planet.
Each one of these amazing reptiles... are born pregnant.
Adaptive and cunning, these 200 could become 40,000 within this year.
If the military is listening to this broadcast... they have to destroy this building immediately... before these creatures can escape.
So far they're all trapped inside this building... but I don't think we can contain them for long.
They're very strong, agile... and they're looking for food.
So your theory of the creature nesting turned out to be correct after all.
Regardless of what happens to us, the most important thing... is that this building be destroyed immediately before they escape.
Reporting live from Madison Square Garden... this is Audrey Timmonds for WIDF News.
Thanks, Audrey.
Sure.
That's affirmative.
Let me spell it out for you.
I want you to blow up
Madison Square Garden.
The good news is they got that message.
The bad news is we've got less than six minutes to get out.
Party's over.
Time to leave.
Anyone care to join me?
- Where did you find this guy?
- He's from France.
Stallion 1-5s I.P. inbound.
You okay?
Guys, this way. Come on.
Oh, my God! The fish.
Nick, come on!
They've eaten all the fish.
Come on, Nick! This way.
Not this way! Back that way!
- The escalators.
- Hurry!
Stallions, check master arms on.
Two, three.
I think I lost them.
Stallion 1-5 showing a good laser track on top of the Garden. Selecting L.G.B.
How much time do we have left?
Less than 30 seconds.
Let's go!
Let's go! Come on!
Come on !
Save your Mavericks.
Two away.
Lead has good hits.
Are you all right?
Yeah.
Somehow I never thought your life was this exciting.
You'd be surprised.
I'd like to find out.
How ya doin'?
You all right?
I could use a coffee.
He looks angry.
What do we do?
Running would be a good idea.
Let's go!
Come on !
- Get in!
- What are you doin'?
You better step on it, Mr. French.
Take 57th Street and cut up the Westside.
Are you crazy?
Take the FDR.
- The FDR in the rain?
- Got to be a map.
He's gettin' larger!
Take the Westside Highway!
- I got one.
- The Westside's got construction.
This is a subway map!
- Broadway?
- Make up your minds!
Take Broadway!
We're traveling down Broadway.
Make a right on 34th Street.
That was O'Neal.
Is everybody okay?
Is everybody all right?
- Turn around. Do it!
- What? Why?
Command center, come in.
This is O'Neal for Hicks.
- What's going on?
- He's back, sir.
Godzilla is still alive.
Lieutenant Rodgers, are those F-18s still in the air?
Yes, sir.
They're heading back to the base.
Turn 'em around.
- Here it is.
- What are we looking for?
Every cab company keeps a record... of each of its cab's radio frequencies.
Bingo!
He's getting closer!
In there. Go in the tunnel.
They've got it blocked.
- Now where would you like to go?
- Turn off the lights.
Nick, are you there?
Nick?
Nice trick with the cab I.D.
Where the hell are you?
You have to help us.
We're in the--
Park Avenue Tunnel.
He's got us trapped in here.
You guys have got to lure him out into the open... so we can get a clear shot at him.
No problem. You want us to wash him up, too?
- Where's the nearest suspension bridge?
- Brooklyn.
- Let's go.
- How would you like us to do that?
This thing have high beams?
Now!
He's headed toward the Brooklyn Bridge.
Target is heading toward the Brooklyn Bridge, sir.
Direct the F-18s to the Brooklyn Bridge.
- He's not following us!
- Really?
You gotta be kiddin' me.
We're in his mouth.
We're in his mouth.
You're goin' the wrong way, man!
Will you shut up?
Gun it! Go, go!
Go, go!
Move it!
O'Neal, it worked!
He's caught in the suspension cables.
Do it!
- Now!
- Roger.
Stallion 1-5, tally one on the bridge.
Fire at will.
Two away!
Hurry up, go!
Direct hit, but the target is still moving.
Circle around and fire again!
That's my husband!
That's my husband!
I'm gonna kill him!
Oh, my.
Oh, God. Oh, no!
Wait. Wait.
We can use this.
"The mayor who destroyed Godzilla."
I don't think we should exploit this.
It could backfire.
Listen, idiot. I do the thinking around here. It's a magnificent idea.
You know what I think about you and your campaign?
Where are you goin'? I need you.
O'Neal, do you read me?
Yes, sir.
That is one hell of a job, soldier.
That's one hell of a job.
Roger that, sir.
Sorry folks.
I've already promised my story... as an exclusive to another reporter.
We did it!
We got the exclusive!
You're beautiful.
We did?
I don't think so.
Remember you work for me.
Not anymore, Chuck.
I quit.
She quits.
All right, folks, let's keep it movin'.
- You take the tape out of the camera?
- No.
- I couldn't have just lost it.
- Where's Philippe?
Hello?
- Hello?
- It's Philippe.
Where are you?
Tell your friends I will send the tape after I've removed a few items from it.
- I understand.
- I wanted to say au revoir.
Thank you for your help, my friend.
Wait. Hello?
Who was that French guy anyway?
Just some insurance guy.
Did he say anything about my tape?
Yeah, he said something about your tape.
- Does he have my tape or not?
- Yeah, he has your tape.
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
It's all right. I'm not gonna hurt you.
What do you want?
I thought you were...
What?
I don't know.
Help! Help!
Help! Help!
Stop!
- What? What?
- It's okay. Come here.
It's okay. Calm down.
Everything's gonna be fine.
What was in there?
Just gimme a minute to figure things out.
- Why were you afraid of that room?
- Gimme a minute I said.
How many people are in this thing?
Listen. We can't go climbing around in here.
Why not?
- There are traps.
- What do you mean traps?
Booby traps. I looked into a room down there and something almost cut my head off.
Holy cats. Holy, holy cats.
You alright? Mister?
Worth!
Don't worry.
I hit my head.
Let me take a look at that.
I'm a doctor. It doesn't look that bad.
What the hell are you doing?
Hey, old man, did you hear what I said?
Motion detectors. Integrated into the walls. Tough to spot.
Oh god, oh god, oh god.
Wait a second.
Let's all just relax for a minute.
Does anybody remember how they got here?
Perogies.
I was eating dinner.
Perogies. Cheese and potatoes.
I ran out of sour cream and then
I went to the fridge and then...
I don't know.
You? Leaven?
I, I just went to bed and...
What about you?
I just woke up here.
Middle of the night.
It's like Chile. They always come in the middle of the night.
Who?
Only the goverment could build something this ugly.
It ain't government.
- Then what is it?
- I don't know.
Aliens.
Please.
We're spooked enough as it is.
Let's rule out aliens for now and concentrate on what we know.
My mom's gonna freak.
Rennes?
- I just won't be there. They'll freak.
- What do you think, Rennes?
We won't solve jack shit sittin' still.
I'm moving in a straight line
'till I get to the end.
All right, I tend to agree.
- Shouldn't we wait here?
- For what?
To see if anybody comes.
No one is gonna come.
Look. There is a way in here, so there's gotta be a way out.
We can avoid the traps using the boot.
Holloway is it?
What do you think? Look for an exit?
Okay.
What about you?
- It can't be that simple.
- It won't be that simple.
Look around.
Take a good long looksee.
'Cause I got a feeling it's looking at us.
I just want to wake up.
Leaven. We can do this.
We just have to stay calm and work together as a team.
There's gonna be a lot of people looking for us on the outside.
I'm a cop.
All right?
- You're a cop?
- Yeah.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
I promise.
You gotta be with me on this one.
Okay.
Boot it!
Clean.
That one sounded closer.
It's mechanical. It seems to come at regular intervals.
Maybe it's the ventilation system.
- No vents.
- No kidding, I'm boiling.
What is it?
Serial numbers?
Room numbers.
They're different in each room.
Oh great. There are only 566 millions
400 thousand rooms in this thing.
Well, there better not be?
We have about 3 days without food and water before we are too weak to move.
Well, they have to feed us, don't they?
Holloway.
Oh, we have heat, stress, physical exsection, i.e., dehydratation, headaches, dizziness, disorientation, confused mental processes.
The body eventually begins to break down its own tissue.
Suck on it.
Keeps the saliva flowing.
- What?
- The air seems dry in there.
Trapped?
Molecular chemical sensor.
Why the hell didn't the boot set it off?
The boot's not alive.
Detects hydrogen sulphide excreted from the skin.
How is it you know so much about sensors, Renz?
Renn. Not Renz. It's French.
Fine, you're French.
I'm asking how you...
Renn. Sensor expert, about the right age.
I don't believe it.
- This guy is the Wren.
- The what?
He's the Wren. The Bird of Attica.
Flew the coop on 6 major prisons.
Seven.
You're kidding, right?
You can get us out.
Maybe.
An escape artist.
Yeah, I'm Harry fucking Houdini.
The only reason I dragged you this far is 'cause I need your boots.
If you don't smarten up,
I'll be gone like that.
No more talking.
No more guessing.
Don't even think about nothing that's not right in front of you.
That's the real challenge.
You got to save yourselves from yourselves.
Merde.
Get him out!
Oh my god!
So, it was electro chemical or whatever, right? And he missed it.
The Wren. That's great!
That's fuckin' great!
All right. It's time to reassess this place.
I've been over it again and again.
Why would they throw innocent people in here?
Are we being punished?
I've never done anything to deserve this.
Forget about all that!
You can't see the big picture from in here, so don't try.
Keep your head down.
Keep it simple.
Just look at what's in front of you.
That's what he said.
Start with us.
We got an escape artist and a cop.
There's gotta be a reason for that.
You're doctor, Holloway. It gives you a function, a reason, right?
No. It's just makes me go why me and why not one of the other
10 million doctors out there.
Leaven, what are you?
Nothing. I just go to school.
I hang out with my friends.
- What else?
- There's nothing else.
My parents are these people.
I live with them. I'm boring.
I think we have to ask the big questions.
What does it want?
What is it thinking?
One down, four to go.
Why don't you tell us what your purpose is, Worth?
Often wondered that myself.
I'm just a guy.
I work in an office building, doing office building stuff.
I wasn't exactly bursting with
"joie de vivre" before I got here.
Life just sucks in general.
- I can't stand that attitude.
- Because he's right.
What's your purpose, Quentin?
Kids, three of them.
I haven't made my peace yet.
I'm getting out of here, no matter what.
That's where my strength comes from.
You, people, find yours wherever you got it.
For Christ's sake, Worth.
What do you live for?
Don't you have a wife or a girlfriend, or something?
No. I've got a pretty fine collection of pornography.
Oh, nice, nice.
I haven't got anybody either, but
I'm not giving up! I am pissed off.
They came into our homes!
They stripped us bare.
They took my rings, they took...
...oh, my amethyst.
I wanna know who's responsible.
Leaven. Your glasses?
You don't need them?
They're for reading.
Well they took off our jewelry, but why they put these on you.
If nothing is random, why are they here?
Leaven. What do you do in school? Math?
What can they mean?
Prime numbers. I can't believe
I didn't see it before.
See what?
It seems like, if any of these numbers are prime, then the room's trapped.
645, 645... That's not prime.
372... no.
Well, 11 times 59.
It's not prime either.
So that room is safe.
Wait.
How can you make that assumption based on one prime number trap?
I'm not. The incinerator thing was prime 083.
The molecular chemical thing had
137. The acid room had 149.
You remember all that in your head?
I have a facility for it.
Leaven, you beautiful brain.
Boot it.
Okay, out of the way.
Brains before beauty.
Safe, safe.
Prime numbers! Prime numbers!
Oh, how long have we been in here?
Nine or ten hours.
How do you know?
Five o'clock shadow. Last thing
I remember was shaving.
I guess
I missed breakfast or lunch... or whatever.
Don't worry.
I'll be home in time for dinner.
If we get out, I'll make you dinner.
You got a date.
Doin' good.
I need to smoke.
I'd smoke a butt off a sidewalk.
Holloway.
Just reel yourself in a bit. Come on.
We're moving along.
Things are looking up.
Ok, ok. You are right.
I quit smoking years ago.
I just need to be occupied.
Talk then. Have a conversation.
What kind of doctor are you anyway?
Oh, you know, the free kind.
Come on. Help me.
Tell me about your rug rats.
We have three boys. 9, 7 and 5.
Good God. Poor woman.
There's no way I'd survive that.
She didn't either.
She's not dead, we're just separated.
I'm sorry.
I can't just shoot the breeze.
These numbers aren't prime.
Okay, clear.
Excuse me, sorry.
You, could try and help me out here, buddy.
No, I couldn't.
This one's trapped too.
We have to backtrack?
Not yet.
Read them to me.
- What are you, his coat rack?
- Oh, please!
It's stuck.
Look out.
This room is green.
Holloway?
Hi there.
This room is green.
Yes, it is.
I wanna go back to the blue room.
What is it? Shock or what?
I think he's mentally handicapped.
I like the blue room.
- Jesus Christ.
- He almost broke my neck.
Hey there, are you all alone?
You want to hold my hand, honey?
Butter first, then honey, Kazan.
Butter first, then honey...
- How'd he survive?
- I want to go back to the blue room.
There's lots of blue rooms.
We'll find you another real soon.
This is just way too bizarre.
Well, you just worry about your numbers then.
Go on. I'll look after him.
Safe. Obviously, since he almost fell on my head.
Should we go for a walk, Kazan?
You want to go for a walk?
Let's not make him do the climbing thing right away.
Holloway...
Hol-lo-way.
Could they have taken us all the way to New Mexico?
What are you talking about, Holloway?
I'm talking about where do you hide something this big.
At least he's good for something.
I'm sorry to shake your foundations, Quentin, but you have no idea where your tax dollars go.
Free clinic doctors?
Only the military industrial complex could afford to build something this size.
Holloway, what is the military industrial complex?
Have you ever been there?
I'm telling you, it's not that complex.
How would you know from where you are?
Who do you think the establishment is?
It's just guys like me.
Their desks are bigger, but their jobs are't.
They don't conspire... they buy boats.
No, this place is... remember Scaramanga?
The bad guy in
"The Man With The Golden Gun".
It's some rich psycho's entertainment.
Is that what you think?
Clear.
Ok. You are a cop.
Single bullet theory. Right on.
- Gas!
- Holloway, get back here!
It's okay.
I just swallowed my button.
I hate this. I hate this.
Your boy is having a conniption fit in there.
It's like cramming without coffee.
- She needs a break.
- She can do it.
They don't look like prime to me.
Is that your two bits worth, Worth?
For what it's worth.
- Well?
- Well, he's right. Not prime.
Stop! In front of you!
What is it?
Shut up!
I don't know what happened.
It wasn't prime.
Quentin, hold still.
- Somebody stops that racket.
- Worth!
Leave the boots.
And shut the fucking door!
I had a feeling about that fucking guy.
He knew about that trap.
These numbers aren't prime.
Then your number system failed, but he knew...
Knew what? How would he know?
You are the paranoid one, think about it.
His only function so far has been to kick us when we're down.
So he has a bad attitude. Are you saying, that makes him a spy?
Trust me on this. It's my job to read people like an X-Ray.
He doesn't like red rooms.
So what happened?
- You saw what happened.
- Quentin!
I guess the numbers are more complicated that I thought.
Maybe they mean nothing at all.
No. It means they are more involved.
They've worked for us up 'till now, haven't they?
I just need more time with them.
Well, we need to rest anyway.
Well. That's handy. 'Cause there's not a fuck of a lot else we can do.
Are they telling you anything?
They're not tarot cards.
Do you have any idea how many variables I have to consider before I can decipher numbers this size?
They don't reveal themselves right away.
They're like people.
Oh, gross.
Oh, not here honey.
Over in the corner.
Well, he's just peeing.
Jesus Christ.
That's excellent.
Now it totally reeks in here!
You find this all pretty funny, don't you?
What's your fucking problem, Worth?
Even Holloway's holding up better than you.
Get over there and help her with him.
That's your job. Babysitter.
Jawohl, Kommandant.
Somebody has to take responsability around here.
And that somebody has to be you.
Not all of us have the luxury of playing nihilist.
Not all of us are conceited enough to play hero.
This is a will to live.
Everybody's got it,
Worth, even you.
Especially you, hiding behind that cynical front.
A will to live.
That's the warm, cosy feeling deep inside.
Thanks Quentin, I'm a new man.
Oh, poor Worth. Nobody loves me.
If that's the chip on your shoulder, why did you lug it all this way?
Why didn't you just lie down and die?
Do it.
Show us you have some backbone and jump in the sushi machine.
Be a man.
Thought so.
Fuck you Quentin!
I don't wanna die.
I'm just being realistic.
Do you think they'd go to all the trouble to build this thing if we could just walk out?
Do you think they would have left us clues and let us beat it so far if there wasn't a way out?
You think we matter? We don't.
Put us out of your misery so we can get on with getting out of here.
You're not getting out of here!
- Yes, we are!
- No, you're not!
- Yes, we are!
- There is no way out of here!
Gotchya.
How do you know that?
Answer the question, Worth.
Oh, god.
Who are you?
I'm the poison.
I designed the outer shell.
The what?
The shell. The sarcophagus.
You built this thing?
Not this part. The exterior.
I don't know anything about the numbers or anything else in here.
I was contracted to draw plans for a hollow shell.
A cube.
A cube? Why didn't you tell us?
For God's sake, Worth, you knew what it was.
No.
Worth. You're lying.
Was not at first.
Who's behind it?
I don't know.
Who hired you?
I didn't ask.
I never even left my office.
I talked on the phone to some people, other guys like me.
Specialists, working on small details.
Nobody knew what it was.
Nobody cared.
Bullshit.
You knew from square one.
Look at him. He is up to his eyeballs in this thing.
No, Quentin.
That's how they stay hidden.
You keep everyone separated so the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing.
The brain never comes out in the open.
Whose brain?
It's all the same machine, right!
The Pentagone, multinational corporations, the police.
If you do one little job, you build a widget in Saskatoon, and the next thing you know it's two miles under the desert, the essential component of a death machine.
I was right.
All along, my whole life,
I knew it. I told you, Quentin.
Nobody's every gonna call me paranoid again.
We gotta get out of here and blow the lid of this thing!
Holloway, you don't get it.
Then help me, please, I need to know.
This may be hard for you to understand, but there's no conspiracy.
Nobody is in charge.
It's a headless blunder operating under the illusion of a master plan.
Can you grasp that?
Big brother is not watching you.
What kind of fuckin' explanation is that?
It's the best you are gonna get.
I looked, and the only conclusion
I could come to is that there is nobody up there.
Somebody had to say yes to this thing.
What thing?
Only we know what it is.
- We have no idea what it is.
- We know more than anybody else.
I mean, somebody might have known sometime before they go, they got fired, or voted out, or sold it, but if this place ever had a purpose, and it got miscommunicated, or lost in a shuffle.
I mean, this is and accident, a forgotten perpetual public works project.
Do you think anybody wants to ask questions?
All they want is a clear conscience, and a fat paycheck.
I leaned on my shovel for months on this one.
This was a great job!
Why put people in it?
Because it's here. You have to use it or you admit it's pointless.
But it is pointless.
Quentin. That's my point.
What have we come to?
It's so much worse than I thought.
Not really. Just more pathetic.
You make me sick, Worth.
I make me sick too.
We're both part of the system.
I drew a box, you walk a beat.
It's like you said, Quentin, is keep your head down, keep it simple, just look at what's in front of you.
I mean, nobody wants to see the big picture.
Life's too complicated.
I mean, let's face it, the reason we're here is that it's out of control.
This is how we ruin the world?
Well, have you been on glue all your lives?
I've felt guilty for ruining the world since I was like 7.
God, if you need someone to blame, throw a rock.
Well, I feel better.
That's why you stayed with us.
To confess.
You still looking for someone to bust, Quentin?
Quentin! Stop it! Stop it!
We need him.
What for?
Have you gone absolutely mad?
He's the only one who knows anything about the place.
- Worth.
- Hi.
- So there's this outer shell.
- Yeah.
- And it's a cube, right? Like this.
- I assume so.
- Are there any doors?
- There's one door.
- Where?
- Wherever the door guy put it.
Six guesses, and it's sealed from the outside.
And, what are the dimensions of the outer shell?
434 square feet.
May I?
Come on, honey, slide over.
14 by 14 by 14.
The inner cube can't be flush with the shell wall, there's a space.
One cube?
I don't know, it makes sense.
Ok. The biggest the cube can be then is...
26 rooms high,
26 rooms across, so...
17.576 rooms.
Seventeen thousand, five hundred and seventy-six rooms?
That makes me queasy.
Descartes!
- Leaven, you are a genius.
- What? What?
Cartesian coordinates. Of course, coded cartesian coordinates.
They're used in geometry to plot points on a 3-dimensional graph.
In English, slower.
Bonjour?
These numbers are markers, and grid reference, like latitude and longitude on a map.
The numbers tell us where we are inside the cube.
Well, where are we?
It works.
Okay. All I have to do is add the numbers together.
The X coordinate is 19...
Y is 26 rooms...
So that places us...
...seven rooms from the edge.
All right, let's go.
Just out of curiosity, I mean, don't hit me again, or anything... but what are you gonna do when you get there?
Maybe we can get the door open.
What we need is to do figure out how to get around the traps.
I'm dealing with that Holloway.
I'm looking for practical solutions here.
Well, you haven't found any yet.
We cut the risk with the numbers and the boot. Worth will go in first.
No, he won't Quentin!
We take turns!
Relax.
Room for two in there?
What's the matter?
These coordinates. 14, 27, 14.
- What about 'em?
- They don't make sense.
Assuming the cube is
26 rooms across, there can't be a coordinate larger than 26.
If this were right, then we would be outside of the cube.
No, not outside of the cube.
I guess that means we're not having dinner.
Trap. Trap. Trap. Trap.
Trap!
Trap!
Sound activated.
Lovely.
How come the sound of the door opening didn't set it off?
Must be rigged to ignore it.
So that's it. The edge is surrounded by traps.
Well, I guess we have to backtrack, and try somewhere else.
Who knows how many detours we'll have to take.
I say we cross the bitch.
Right!
How many boots do we have left,
Holloway?
Get it off him.
We know how it works.
We just have to be quiet.
That's pretty fucking quiet.
I'm glad you're on side,
Worth, 'cause... you're up.
And he is not coming.
Of course, he is.
- No way.
- We are not leaving him behind.
He's unpredictable.
When we get to the edge, we can come back for him.
But he'll get somebody killed here.
Am I right?
Shame on you.
Will you look at yourselves?
What have you turned into?
They may have taken our lives away, but we are still human beings.
That's all we've got left.
We'll come back for him.
That's a lie and you know it.
He'll be quiet.
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna wait for him.
- No.
- You go out, I'm here.
Okay.
This way.
- You fucking fuck!
- That's enough!
- He is a trap!
- Let him go right now!
The law of the jungle!
He is endangering the pack!
Let him go, you Nazi!
What did you call me?
Quentin, you let that innocent boy go.
You listen to me, woman.
Everyday I mop up after your bleeding heart.
The only reason you even exist is because I keep you.
I know your type, no kids, no man to fuck you.
So you go around outraged, sticking your nose up other people's assholes, sniffing their business!!!
You missed your boat, Holloway.
You're all dried up inside there, aren't you?
That's your fucking problem.
How dare you say that to her?
You don't know her, Quentin.
None of us know each other here.
- Oh, I do.
- No you don't.
No wonder your wife left you.
All that bottled up anger.
And a thing for young girls.
God help you, Quentin.
Did you smack your kids around too?
Is anybody besides me interested in what's on the other side of that door?
Open it.
Door number six? Not number one?
Door number two?
Open the fuckin' thing.
Oh, sunshine.
Night time.
My old friend, the shell.
It's there. Morning!
Hang on to me.
I can't see shit.
Nothin' to hang on to.
We gotta try something.
We gotta see if the door's over there.
Someone has to swing over there, and take a look.
Swing?
We make a rope, out of clothes.
Take 'em off.
I'll tie it around myself.
Ah, yeah, and you're gonna go.
You weight like 500 ponds, it'll snap in two seconds.
I'm the lightest.
Forget it.
I'll go.
I'm going, Holloway.
She's right Quentin, you're too heavy.
I'm the lightest after Leaven.
Anyway, it's my turn.
How long did you know people were being put in here?
A couple of months.
That's not long, if you consider your whole life.
I am.
You opened my eyes Worht.
That's something.
David.
Helen.
You're such a Helen.
That's as far as you go.
There's nothing down here.
Hold tight.
I try swinging over there.
Brace yourselves,
I'm gonna try again.
- Okay, one more time.
- Hurry, you're getting heavy.
What the hell's going on?
Get up here now!
- Quentin!
- Have you got her?
- What's going on?
- Quentin, is she okay?
She... slipped.
Holloway?
Hey, shhh...
Come on, Kazan.
Kazan, will you please stop doing that?
Leaven, you got be strong, sweetheart.
Don't even talk to me.
We gotta get down to the bottom.
It will be easier to get on to the shell from there.
It's a long fucking way with only one boot.
But we gotta do it before we get too weak.
You gotta keep cracking the numbers, Leaven.
I can't think anymore.
Sure you can. It's your gift.
It's not a gift. It's just a brain.
Let her sleep for a while. We haven't slept in fuck knows how long.
All right.
One hour.
How the fuck are you gonna know how long an hour is?
An hour is as long as I say.
What are you doing?
We have to make it down to the bottom.
It'll be quiet there, and you can concentrate.
- You just want to leave them?
- They're traps, Leaven.
We are the key.
I'll get us down there.
You think us out.
Believe in me!
Try and see what I see, how my mind works.
The flash when I look into someone's head like a fucking X-ray.
I looked through the walls.
I dreamed him at his desk, designing everything.
He can't let you solve the puzzle, see, 'cause there is a purpose.
We are the purpose. The cube...
...is us.
- Quentin.
- We fit. Like numbers.
A man and a woman.
Two halves of the equation.
I take you down, the perfect key.
I slip you in the lock.
Leaven, it's time to go down.
Get away from her.
Leaven, they're fuckin' spies.
Him, the retard.
Holloway, had outside information about my family... but she slipped up, didn't she?
She crossed the line!
You dropped her.
Just go, Quentin.
Give us the boot, you pig!
You don't want the boot.
You want to came with us, Worth?
Down the hatch.
What the fuck's with him?
How did...
It's, it's, it's the Wren.
It's the old Wrenster.
How could...
We've been going around in circles.
That can't be.
- Where are we?
- I don't know!
Where are we?
You figure it out!
You haven't done anything.
All you do is freak out you, murderer!
I guess you were right, Worth.
There is no way out of here.
Get away from me.
Wasn't Rennes killed in that room?
How come there's nothing out there?
It's the edge.
We weren't at the edge before.
Where's the room that killed Rennes?
Fuck off!
Oh, that was good.
What difference does it make?
We're dead anyways.
Hey, listen to what I'm saying.
There was a room there before.
We haven't been moving in circles.
The rooms have.
- Of course.
- The rooms?
That explains the thunder and the shaking.
We've been shifting the whole time.
It's the only logical explanation.
I'm such an idiot!
- What are you on to, Leaven?
- Give me a minute.
The numbers are markers, points on a map, right?
Right.
How do you map a point that keeps moving?
Permutations.
Permu what?
Permutations.
A list of all the coordinates that the room passes through.
Like a map, that tells you where the rooms starts, how many times it moves, and where it moves to.
The numbers tell you all that?
I don't know, see, I've only been looking at one point on the map, which is probably the starting position.
All I saw was what the cube looked like before it started to move.
Okay, so it's moving.
How do we get out?
I know where the exit is.
Where?
- Stay away from me.
- Back off, Quentin.
I just wanna know.
Don't you wanna know?
You remember that room we passed through before, the one with the coordinate larger than 26?
What about it?
That coordinate placed the room outside the cube.
A bridge.
Right.
But only in its original position.
What are you talking about?
Look.
The room starts off as a bridge, and then it moves its way through the maze, which is where we ran into it.
But at some point, it must return to its original position.
- So a bridge is only a bridge.
- For a short period of time.
This thing is like a giant combination lock.
When the rooms are in their starting position, the lock is open.
But when they move out of alignment, the lock closes.
With a structure this size, it must take days for the rooms to complete a full cycle.
So, when does it open?
Don't.
To find the original coordinates, the numbers are added together.
To find the permutations, they're subtracted from one another.
That's it!
This room moves to zero,
1 and -1 on the X-axis.
2, 5 and -7 on Y.
And 1, and -1 and zero on Z.
And what does that mean?
You suck at math?
Okay, I need the room numbers around us as reference points.
- 567, 898. Okay?
- Yes.
And 545.
Did you get that?
That's enough.
X is 17, Y is 25 and Z is 14.
Which means this room makes 2 more moves before returning to its original position.
- Do we have time?
- Maybe.
Then let's go!
Can you work the traps into this system?
Fuck the traps.
Let's get to the bridge.
You threw out our last boot, you fucking idiot.
- Technically, I can identify the traps.
- Technically?
At first, I thought that they were identified by prime numbers, but they are not.
They are identified by numbers that are the power of a prime.
- Ok, so?
- Can you calculate that?
The numbers are huge.
But you can, right? She can.
I'd have to calculate the number of factors in each set.
Maybe if I had a computer.
- You don't need a computer.
- Yes I do.
- Figure it out.
- I can't.
I'm not dying in a fucking rat maze!
Look. Nobody in the whole world could do it mentally.
Look at the numbers. 567898545.
There's no way I can factor that!
I can't even start on 567!
It's astronomical!
Astronomical.
What did you say?
Astronomical.
Before that.
Factors.
How many factors Kazan?
Of 567.
What, are you fucking kidding?
Kazan. How many factors does 30 have?
- How about 7?
- 1. Gum drop.
I don't have any gum drops.
Gum drop.
Kazan. I'll give you a whole box of gum drops for each answer.
Gum drops come in bags.
Okay. You want them in bags, they are coming in bags.
I don't like the red ones.
He's giving us the factors.
Astronomical.
You're telling me telethon boy is a genius?
By those numbers, the room should be safe.
Only one way to find out.
Don't!
Safe.
Kazan, my man.
What's the number, buddy boy?
Hey, right here, look here!
Make him do it!
Kazan, we're gonna do some numbers now, okay?
We like to do numbers, right?
- Prime numbers.
- That's right.
- Can you tell me the factor of 656?
- Clear.
- Move!
Come on. Come on, let's go. You too, Worth!
Move your scawny ass, Worth.
I'm not through with you yet.
Leaven, open that door.
Get Einstein working on the numbers.
Oh, jeez.
- Go!
- Worth!
- Hurry!
- Leaven!
- Please, Kazan, 563?
- You fuckers, you're dead!
- Clear!
- Trapped!
- Check the floor.
- Is he dead?
Not quite.
Not even close. Worth,
I'm getting out of here and
I'll feed you to a fucking trap on the way.
Where is he?
Come here. I said come here right nooowwww!!
Gotchya. That way.
- Clear!
- Clear!
Guess that proves our theory.
Numbers.
- Clear.
Kazan!
Listen.
- He hasn't moved far.
- I'll go find him.
What do you think?
You don't have a lot of lives left.
- Kazan!
- I didn't move.
Yeah, good. But you're gonna have to climb up here, okay?
I don't like that.
Worth, get back here right now!
Five bags of gum drops.
27 bags total.
27 bags. Deal.
This room's next move takes it to the bridge!
We're coming!
Over here!
Move it! We don't have much time. Come on.
Worth? Worth?
This better be it.
It should be.
Where?
Oh, well!
Give me a minute. Be patient.
- So, guess what?
- No.
This is the room we started in.
I was right. We should never have moved in the first place.
The bridge.
Red.
Kazan?
- Clear!
Worth!
Go ahead.
What are you doing?
You can't quit now.
It's not your fault!
I have nothing to live for out there.
What is out there?
Boundless human stupidity.
I can live with that.
Noooooo!!!
Kazan! Get out through the door!
Red, Kazan.
Where do I begin?
I guess with the idea that sometimes things happen that we don't understand.
Maybe we shouldn't try to.
My dad had been assigned to inspect the military southern sector of the EPA.
My stepmother, my half-brother and I spent two months on the road with him.
It's hard being in a car with a 6-year-old and the woman who replaced your mom.
But nobody asked me what I wanted to do that summer.
I guess things do happen for a reason...
...even if you don't like what that reason is.
Come on.
Fill it up.
- You got a rest room?
- It ain't great, but we've got one.
- Not the "big old fat" part.
- Which part?
- Can I have a soda?
- No.
- I see you're from Washington, D.C.
- That's right.
Long way from home.
You're bad. You're bad.
You're scared.
Good.
They're out there.
They're everywhere!
They get you when you sleep.
They get you when you sleep, you hear?
Get out, or you'll be next!
Dad! Dad!
There's a psycho in there!
- In the bathroom?
- He's got a knife!
Sweetheart?
Maybe you should let him go in first.
He's got a gun.
Maybe you'd better come back here, honey.
There's nothing here.
There's no one in there.
You okay?
No one's there?
Marti, are you okay?
Are you all right? What did he want?
Maybe we should file a police report.
"They get you when you sleep."
I remember thinking he was crazy...
...but I also remember thinking we spend half our lives asleep.
'Morning, sir.
I'm Steve Malone. I'm with the EPA.
General Platt's expecting us.
One moment.
Follow the signs to Sector C.
I got it.
Fifty-nine. There are three doors, so it should be...
Let's see. It's this...
How'd you know that?
He's so smart. This kid of ours is so smart.
How'd you know it was that door?
Tie your shoelaces.
I'll do it.
Are you sure this is the right door?
This is it?
Great.
Andy, come on. Help me unload the car.
Come on, I'm going to get there before you do.
Andy, honey, slow down.
There are only two bedrooms.
You've got to share with your brother then.
Steve, can you give me a hand up here?
Don't work too hard.
If we'd known what was waiting for us, we would've run.
But, in the end, it had to happen.
And so it began.
- This is a restricted area, miss.
- What?
You shouldn't be here without security clearance.
What's up?
Get in the car.
I'm Jenn.
Marti.
Thanks for picking me up.
No problem. They're dicks.
What was that all about?
God knows. They always have a bug up their ass. Ignore them.
So what heinous misfortune brings you here?
A month in hell with my dad and his wife.
He's with the EPA.
EPA, cool! Hippies saving the planet.
Look at those goons.
They actually volunteered for this crap.
Can you believe it?
What are you doing here?
Not much.
My dad runs the place.
He does?
Mom? There's somebody here.
Look at this shit.
This is why my dad's an insomniac.
He's afraid she'll burn the house down in her sleep.
Mom, this is Marti. Marti, my mom.
Vodka. Want some?
Mom's an alcoholic.
The experts say that means I'll be one too.
Let's go. Come on.
Nice to meet you, Mrs. Platt.
And I don't know what's wrong with the kids.
They treat me like I'm some stranger rather than their father.
Why are you here?
What do you want?
You're young, but you're old.
Steve, you're going to get a mucho kiss.
Time for your mucho.
Carol doesn't like mucho kisses.
- Hi, honey.
- Did we wake you?
- Sorry.
- What's wrong?
I had a nightmare.
Come here. I'll give you a kiss and a big hug.
A bad dream can't hurt you.
Everybody has bad dreams, honey.
It's okay.
It's okay. Come on,
I'll take you back to bed.
What the hell was that?
Have you ever been in the military?
No, General.
Then you know absolutely nothing about biological and chemical warfare, do you?
It seems to me...
...that it'd be a lot more dangerous to move this stuff around...
...than to leave it where it is.
If these chemicals are safely stored, you have nothing to worry about.
I have nothing to worry about?
Explain that.
Come in here, Captain.
Yes, sir.
Escort Dr. Malone around the base.
Show him what he needs to see.
Let him take samples and run tests.
Then do whatever you have to to expedite his departure.
Mr. Malone?
Good afternoon, sir.
- Can I help you?
- Yeah.
Can you give us some space?
I want to talk to him.
I'm Major Collins, head of the base medical corps.
Hold on.
I wanted to meet you...
...and extend my cooperation to you personally.
Thank you.
I'm very interested in the effects exposure to these chemicals can have on people.
Effects?
You got a lot of chemicals on this base.
They're all pretty toxic.
Effects? Physically, they could be devastating.
Not physically. I'm referring to psychological effects.
I'm not following you.
Can they affect brain patterns?
Can they interfere with chemo-neurological processes?
Can they foster psychoses, paranoias...
...narcophobias?
I'm a chemist, not a psychiatrist.
I don't know.
Simply...
...can they alter one's view of reality?
Let me be frank.
I'm seeing people at the infirmary...
...who are exhibiting...
...extreme delusional fixations.
People...
...afraid to sleep.
People afraid to...
...deal with family members.
Afraid of them.
Exhibiting...
...paranoia about others...
...about other people's identities.
People afraid of themselves.
Suddenly, I got a camp full of very displaced people.
I don't know what you're seeing, but it's not the PCBs.
That phenomenon is not part of the symptomology.
Keep me up to date on your research.
I'm worried about these... people.
Better take a vacation, Doc.
We have equipment for Dr. Malone.
Come in.
What are you doing in there?
Delivering the boxes.
Are you through?
Good.
Very good.
Good work.
Very good work.
Very good.
Okay, all done?
Everyone hold your picture up.
Very good.
Good.
Very good.
"When it's over, let's do it again."
Hey, little man!
Hey, little man!
- What are you doing?
- Running away.
What are you running from?
The bad people.
The bad people?
Come, we'll take you home.
- Your folks in the military?
- No.
Sector C, Petey.
There's my bike!
That's your bike? Okay, pull it over.
Sure this is the house?
What's going on?
Found him wandering around.
We figured he was lost.
You should be in day care.
I hate that place.
What happened?
They all had the same pictures.
They tried to make me go to sleep.
Tried to make me go to sleep.
Sorry to have troubled you.
No trouble.
What're you doing home?
Are you an MP, or something?
No, I'm a chopper pilot.
Thanks for bringing him home.
Maybe I'll see you around.
Where?
Top Gun? It's on Route 8.
It's the only club around.
Name's Tim.
Marti.
- No problem at all.
- Thanks.
Take care.
- Thank you.
- No problem.
Appreciate it.
Thanks very much.
All right. Take care.
- Say, "Thank you."
- Thank you.
What's this about, "The kids don't like me?" How could they not?
He's the new kid.
It's his first day at school.
The faster he goes back, the faster he'll make friends.
- Hi.
- Hey, chick.
Get your coat. Let's go.
Where are we going?
Out. Anywhere. Anywhere but here.
Jenn Platt, Carol.
I'm sorry, I didn't realize you knew...
Steve!
Marti has a friend here. Want anything?
- We don't have much.
- I'm fine.
We have milk, orange juice...
I could make lemonade. Or tea.
We have mint.
- Jenn Platt. Nice to meet you.
- Steve Malone.
Popcorn?
- I'm fine.
- Did you say "Platt"?
Yes, the general's daughter.
I came by to take Marti and show her around.
Where?
The base. The rec center.
When are you planning to be home?
Done! Let's go.
But do be home by 12:00. That's all I ask.
Just be home by 12:00.
Nice meeting you.
That's a really interesting outfit you've got on.
- Here?
- This is it.
I don't have any ID.
Don't get your panties in a bunch.
Just come.
Oh, man, where is everybody?
Hey, ladies.
You want to dance?
Lambada?
Look who's here.
I don't believe my eyes. Jenn.
Where is everybody?
Word get out that you'd be here?
They heard your old man was coming.
Yeah, to court-martial your ass.
- This is Pete and...
- Marti.
You know each other?
We met earlier.
When? You just got here yesterday.
What do I do to get a drink here?
You want a drink? Have a drink.
Come here.
You can have anything.
You know that.
This is romantic.
Now what?
Let me dazzle you with my stick work.
Or not.
I mean, let's play some pool.
All right, let's go.
Sit down.
How are you?
Good.
How's your brother?
He's kind of weirded out.
Can I get you a drink?
Yeah. I'll have whatever he's having.
Yeah, right.
Hey, Melissa, can I get a couple of beers, please?
Andy's a nice kid.
Do you want him?
Do I want him?
Shit!
What's wrong?
- I know that guy.
- What guy?
He scared me.
What'd you do to her?
What are you talking about?
In the gas station.
Your girlfriend's had too much to drink.
You should take her home.
Oh, Tim.
It's okay.
Guess I made a mistake.
I was 7 when she died.
I didn't expect my dad to marry again.
Stupid, huh?
You must really miss her.
What was your mother like?
You always remember the good things about people.
I miss her.
Did you ever play, "I Never"?
What's that?
You put your hands up...
...and the object is to make the other guy drop all his fingers down.
So, if I were to say...
..."I've never been to Mars"...
...then neither of us put our fingers down,
'cause we haven't been there.
But if you said, "I never wore a dress"...
...then I'd have to put a finger down.
Get it?
- Okay, go ahead.
- You start.
I've never eaten Brussels sprouts.
I've never been in a helicopter.
I've never tried to give my kid brother away.
I've never shot anyone.
When?
Kuwait.
I never hide my feelings.
- What's the matter?
- It's Mommy!
- What about Mommy?
- Her head came off. She's dead!
- There's Mommy, right there.
- She's not my mommy!
- What happened?
- He had a bad dream.
It's okay. I'll put you to bed.
No! That isn't my mommy!
Wait!
Wait!
Take your brother inside.
Take him inside. Do it.
- Are you aware she's underage?
- No, sir.
You aware you're giving booze to an underage girl?
You weren't aware of that?
- No, sir.
- No?
- That's funny?
- No, sir.
Don't come here anymore.
Come on.
I'm not lying, Marti!
Nobody said you were.
I had nightmares when I was your age.
They go away all by themselves.
She's not Mommy, Marti.
She is your mommy. She loves you a lot.
My mommy died.
- I don't want to talk. I'm angry.
- Dad, please.
I can't trust you.
You're drunk and an hour late.
I'm not drunk.
And you've known him 100 years...
I had one lousy beer and came home half an hour late!
Big deal! I'm not a fucking 10-year-old!
Don't use that language.
You don't talk that way to me.
Why? It's the only time you'll listen.
- That's not true.
- Bullshit!
You never listen to me. Why do I bother?
Wait.
Wait! Wait!
Would you stop kicking the table, please?
Thank you.
I can't wait until I'm 18.
Why? Think you won't be my daughter?
I'll still be your daughter.
I just won't have to listen to you.
You don't listen to me now.
If you want to go so bad, you don't have to wait until you're 18.
Just go now.
You'd like that.
Then it'd just be you three.
Want to go back to day care, or stay home with Mommy?
My mommy's dead.
Okay. Come down.
Be very careful with that stuff.
It's very toxic.
Watch out!
Get an ambulance and a clean-up crew.
Get back. We'll take care of him.
What the hell's the matter with you?
Get an ambulance!
Jesus, what is that?
Nothing.
Shit!
Is Jenn here?
Come on up.
Try this.
Taste it.
- It's water.
- That's right.
There's always vodka in this glass.
Maybe she went on the wagon.
If she were on the wagon, she'd be climbing the walls.
I'm leaving now.
Where are you going?
We're playing bridge at the Smythe's.
What?
She doesn't know how to play bridge.
Sir, there's been an accident in the storage warehouse.
Initial reports indicate camp personnel have been injured.
We're preparing a written summary.
I'll have it for you in an hour.
Thank you, Captain.
I took it off the suit fibers.
I ran the entire herbicide screen.
I still don't know what it is.
I'll send you the sample tomorrow.
Give it the full GCMS.
I'm telling you, I've never seen anything like this in my life.
Ever.
It scares me. It's not blood.
I don't know what the hell it is.
Run a protocol...
...and get back to me quickly.
I want to go home.
Dad promised as soon as he's done with his tests, we'll leave.
It's going to be okay.
It happens when you sleep.
What does?
You die.
Tub's full.
Hurry, it's going to overflow.
Get in bed.
I said, get in bed.
Night-night.
Is your back sore?
Want me to give you a massage?
Yeah, lie down.
Lie down.
Marti's really mad at me.
She'll get over it.
You'll see.
Wake up in the morning...
...be another day.
Be like none of it happened.
She'll be okay.
It'll be over.
I love you.
I love you too.
Just let go.
Daddy! No! Wake up!
Wake up! Wake up!
Wake him up! Get him dressed!
759, Sector C.
We got to go! We got to go right now!
- Listen to me.
- You don't understand! We got to go!
Go where?
Go! What're you talking about?
Steve, this is important.
Go where?
That's right. Go where?
Are you listening?
What happened in your room is not an isolated incident.
It is happening everywhere.
- What?
- Where would we run?
Where are you going to go?
Where are you going to run?
Where are you going to hide?
Nowhere.
Because there's no one like you left.
That's right.
Oh, God.
That's right. That's good.
You're listening now.
Now I know you're frightened, Steve.
I know you're scared. That's okay.
I understand that you're confused.
Let me tell you something, Steve.
All that anger, all that fear and confusion...
...it's going to melt away.
It's going to go away.
It's going to go away. Go to sleep.
Wake up. It's very simple.
In the morning, you'll feel wonderful.
- We'll be together. We're connected.
- What's happening?
We're together.
Your fear. That's good. Let it go.
Get away from me!
Get away from my kids!
This way!
Go on, we'll cover you!
Move it out, mister!
What's all that noise?
Petey, those are gunshots.
Pete, where the fuck are you?
What's going on?
Sit down, Timbo.
What the hell's going on?
Hey, Justin.
Go to sleep, Timbo.
What is this, a joke?
Just go back to bed.
What's with the needle?
What is this?
What're you doing?
I told you to go to bed, didn't I?
Take my watch.
I gotta try to find us some help.
Be back in a couple of hours.
You'll be okay.
You'll be okay.
Do what your sister tells you.
Where are you going?
To find us a way out of here.
Just be very quiet, okay?
Don't worry, sweetheart.
I won't let anything happen to you.
I need an outside line.
Sorry, Major Collins, all the lines are busy at present.
Stay where you are.
I'll keep trying and call you back.
How do you know my name?
I didn't tell you my name!
How the hell do you know my name?
Major.
Back!
It's me. It's Steve Malone.
Remember me?
I know who you are. You...
...stay... back.
You gotta help me.
No time left. My kids are in danger.
My wife is...
Do you have a car?
Please. Come on.
It's too late to run.
It's too late!
They've taken the base!
All we can do is wait until they come and then...
The keys.
The keys.
They'll follow you.
They'll follow you.
That's how they work.
We gotta stand up and fight back now!
I've got a gun for you.
I've got a gun for you too.
We'll give them hell!
We'll give them hell.
We'll show them what the human race is really made of.
Want some?
Stay with me, Doctor. We have to go.
Now.
You can't sleep. You gotta make sure you don't sleep.
Come on.
Please.
Please.
The head cabbage.
Well, well, well, well, well.
Be realistic, Major.
Put it down.
Not before I unload a few into you onion-heads.
Relax, Major. Take it easy.
You disappoint me.
You're a man of medicine.
You're supposed to preserve life, not take it.
You bastard!
You call what you are "life"?
I know who you are!
- I know who you are!
- Do you?
Amphetamines.
I know what happens when you bastards catch somebody sleeping.
Want a few?
Look what your fear has done to you.
Can't you see?
When all things are conformed...
...there'll be no more disputes.
No conflicts.
No more problems.
Abandon yourself and join us.
There are hundreds...
...even thousands of us here.
We've traveled light years throughout the universe...
...always surviving, growing stronger.
Because we've learned...
...it's the race that's important...
...not the individual.
The individual's always important.
- Only unity guarantees survival.
- So you must join us.
- The human race is doomed.
- Accept it.
It's a better way.
- Stay back!
- It's a matter of survival.
Stay back! Stay back!
I'm warning you to stay back!
Doctor...
...put the gun down.
You'll never get my soul.
Never.
"Nobody likes us
"Everybody hates us
"Going to the garden...
"...to get worms
"Long, thin, slimy ones
"...short, fat, juicy ones...
"...itsy-bitsy, fuzzy worms
"First, you bite the head off
"Then you suck the juice out
"Then you throw the rest away"
Everybody okay?
I found us a way out of here.
Dad, they're everywhere!
Where are we going?
I know what I'm doing. Don't worry.
Just don't show any emotion.
They can be fooled.
I know where I'm going.
I know exactly what I'm doing.
Where are you going?
Stop!
Let go! Let go!
Shit! Shit!
Don't make me hurt you. Just calm down.
What's going on?
Let her go!
Leave her alone!
Shoot him! Shoot him!
- What's happening?
- He's not my father!
It's not him!
Shoot him!
- Just back up. Back up. Put it away.
- Don't listen!
- Shoot him!
- What do you mean?
Stay back.
It's not my dad! He killed my father.
- Put it away.
- It's not my dad!
- They killed my father!
- Just relax...
- Shoot him!
...and put it away.
What are you doing?
Marti, let's go.
Come on, Marti!
There's my chopper.
It's too dangerous, so I'm going alone.
Watch for me. I'll land it over here.
Be ready to make your move when I touch down.
We'll get out of here.
Ready for that ride I promised you?
All right.
Just act like one of them.
Be careful.
Nobody believed me.
I figured you'd try a bird.
What do you mean?
You know what I mean.
Now we're all the same, Petey.
So what are you running from?
Who's running?
I've got orders.
We're all one happy family now.
Happy?
What's that?
You're wasting my time, Lieutenant.
They're waiting for light support.
Hey, Timbo...
...just so you know...
...I fucked your girlfriend.
Okay, let him at the bird.
- What are you doing?
- No! Don't!
You're making a mistake!
Don't!
Please.
Wake up!
Wake up!
Try and wake up! Come on!
Camp Perry, Ohio.
West Point, New York.
Fort Knox, Kentucky.
You can do this, Marti.
You're doing fine. Just walk with me.
Fort Monroe, Virginia.
Fort Bliss, Texas.
Where's Andy, Tim?
He's got to be in there.
I didn't see him.
He wasn't in there.
My chopper's right up there.
I'm not leaving without my brother.
We'll get help, then come back for him.
Do what you want, but I'm not leaving without him.
Didn't I tell you this place was a freak show?
Where are you going?
We got work to do.
I saw Andy. He's looking for you.
Where?
Marti, don't leave me!
Marti, wait, don't go!
Don't leave me here!
Go! Go!
Andy, don't! What are you doing? No!
Get him off me!
Andy, what are you doing?
Throw him out!
Throw him out!
He's not your brother!
Throw him out!
Should we go after them?
Let them go. No one'll believe them.
I'm sorry, Marti.
They said nobody would believe us.
Who could believe such a crazy story?
I could hardly believe it myself.
They had destroyed everyone I loved.
Our reaction...
...was only human.
Revenge, hate, remorse, despair, pity...
...and, most of all, fear.
I remember feeling all those things as I watched the bombs explode.
How I hated them.
Army helo-1, this is Atlanta Ground.
You're onscreen with clearance to land.
Runway 2-7, taxiway alpha.
Hover taxi via east-west parallel.
Ground crew standing by at Army guard ramp.
Roger that, Atlanta.
This is High-Bird 1 1. Two-mile final.
We're coming in.
They get you when you sleep...
...but you can only stay awake so long.
Where will you go?
Where will you run?
Where will you hide?
Nowhere.
Because there's no one...
...like you...
...left.
Come this way!
Men wounded in battle we can deal with.
But this strange disease...
Thirty men dead yesterday.
Eighteen, the day before.
We need supplies.
Plasma.
Penicillin.
We'll get what you need.
You're Americans.
Please...
...get me out of this shithole.
Buddy, that's what we're here for.
We're gonna take you home.
First we'll take a blood sample, all right?
I'm gonna die, right?
- You won't die.
- Tell my girl I love her.
I won't tell her.
You're gonna tell her yourself.
The soldiers inside are in the early stages of the disease.
By tomorrow night they will look like this.
Mother of God!
I'll authorize an immediate airdrop.
It's worse than I thought.
Get the plane here by 1900.
Get the plane, Billy.
Come on! All right!
Isn't this your last day?
Yeah.
Sam, are you there?
Pick up the phone. We have a situation in Zaire. It doesn't look good.
Stay there.
Hemorrhagic fever, high mortality.
We picked up a satellite relay from Cairo.
I said stay!
What's up?
Looks like we have a Level 4.
How many dead?
Don't know. There aren't any numbers yet.
- What do you think it is?
- Too early to say.
The WHO is preparing a team, but I want you there first.
You're off Hanta and flying to Zaire.
Let me get my crew together.
I'll get back to you.
I can't believe this. You're wet.
You guys are wet.
Which one disobeyed me first?
Lewis, it was you, right?
You guys are busted. You look very guilty.
Lewis, come on.
Get down.
How are you?
Hi, boys. How you doing?
What are you doing?
You miss me?
Come here. Who wants some breakfast?
Your paper.
You here for your stuff? Come on.
Bagels. Who wants bagels?
Breakfast?
- Who wants some breakfast?
- I've got to go away.
Where?
Zaire. They think there's cases of hemorrhagic fever there.
- Is Casey going?
- Yeah.
And Jaffe. The whole crew.
Most of it.
So you want me to take the dogs?
It's just four days.
I'm going to Atlanta Friday.
If you're late, the dogs go too.
Fair enough.
What will you do at CDC?
Working BL4.
Same as you.
My job.
I'd like to think of it as my job.
And I won't have the Pentagon pressuring me.
This is mine.
Take it.
And the rest of your stuff is in boxes in there.
I can hang on to it till you come back...
...or whatever.
You know that you're giving me all the pictures of us.
You can keep them.
You keep them.
I don't want them.
I don't want them either, Robby.
Thursday!
I want a turn-up, on the mark.
Come on, let's move it.
Let's go!
This plasma goes in the right rudder of the right wing.
- Where is Jaffe?
- His wife is in labor. He's on leave.
- Who'll read the tissue samples?
- You don't trust me?
- Come on!
- Fine.
You want a hotshot scope-jockey, fine, but, frankly, I'm hurt.
- Who cut his orders?
- The Old Man himself.
He hasn't got up this early in years.
- I'll tell him you said so.
- I'll deny it.
Good to see you.
Thought if I showed my star it might speed things up for you.
Is it working?
No.
First file on your new man.
Plus telex traffic to date, and satellite photos from the area.
Sir?
Get in, get out.
I hate having you here, making my life miserable...
...but don't want to lose you to some bug.
- One question.
- Go on.
What have I ever done to make your life miserable?
You got up today.
Thank you, Billy.
Major Salt.
May I say it's an honor to work with you.
West Point, Johns Hopkins. How many hours did you log in helicopter school?
- Married?
- Yes, sir.
- Good luck.
You've never been in the field?
No, sir.
But I'm fully trained and highly motivated.
I'm talking about landing in a hot zone.
It's unique.
Have you seen the effects of hemorrhagic fever?
No, sir.
Allow me.
- Major.
- Yes.
At first the patient has flu-like symptoms.
In 2 or 3 days pink lesions appear on his body, along with pustules...
...which erupt with the blood and pus.
A milky substance begins to...
These lesions become full-blown.
They feel like mush.
There's vomiting, diarrhea, bleeding in the nose, ears, gums.
The internal organs shut down.
They liquify.
Very good.
We've read that in a book too, but...
...in 16 hours you'll see it.
In the flesh, so to speak.
I can handle whatever we encounter.
- If one panics, we're all in danger.
- He's under orders not to die.
And that's a set of orders he actually plans to follow.
That must be it.
He's losing it!
No! Just hang on!
I can't breathe!
Keep your helmet...
- Take it off!
- No!
- Keep it on!
- Keep it on!
Don't let him expose himself!
Goddamn it! Isolate him! Isolate him!
Don't worry.
It's not airborne.
Sam Daniels, USAMRllD.
Benjamin lwabi.
We've been expecting you.
We came as soon as possible.
Not soon enough.
The village is dead.
Do you know the incubation period?
But it kills in 2 or 3 days.
The mortality rate is 100º/.
Jesus.
Could an infected person have gotten out of the village?
If he did, he'd be dead or dying in the jungle.
It's 50 miles to the next village.
First case? Patient zero?
A young man called Murazo.
Worked with a white man to build a road into Kinshasa.
- When he returned he was sick.
- I see.
And he drank from this well.
From there, it spreads to the entire village.
Did you identify the carrier? The host?
No, when we arrived, he was incoherent.
He died two hours later.
He couldn't tell us how he got it.
He's not sick.
He's a local ju-ju man. Witch doctor.
He stayed in his cave all week.
I'd like to talk to him.
No, he talks to me.
You see, he believes that the gods were awoken from their sleep...
...by men cutting down the trees...
...where no man should be.
And the gods got angry.
This...
...is a punishment.
Alarmingly high fatality.
All localized within a 3-mile radius.
Incubation period short.
Appears contained.
You didn't put "alarmingly."
It's an adverb.
It's a lazy tool of a weak mind.
I want to add this:
Billy...
...this is the scariest son-of-a-bitch I've ever seen.
And I've seen a lot.
Fine. Fax it to Ford's house.
Sorry, sir.
It's okay.
I've never seen anything like it.
I put the team in danger, sir.
We're still here.
I got scared, sir.
You know, fear gets a bad rap.
I don't want anybody working with me who isn't scared.
Okay?
Then I'm your man, sir.
I sent the fax 6 hours ago.
I am not going to issue an alert.
But you must issue an alert.
- You said it was contained.
- I said containment was probable.
You should be monitoring the airports!
Remember 1989? You found 2 cases of Congo fever in Nairobi...
...and we put a note in every American kid's lunch box.
- I was wrong.
- You were wrong.
What about 1992? Lassa fever?
- I was wrong.
- Again.
- But now you're right?
- No, I could be...
Yet you waltz into my party smelling like dirty socks...
...take me away from Senator Rosales...
...who heads the Senate Arms Services subcommittee in charge of our budget!
Forget Ebola, forget Lassa.
This bug kills so fast...
Keep your voice down.
Now that is exactly my point.
It is the very lethality of this virus which works for us here.
They don't live long enough to spread the thing around. So it is contained.
I hope so.
I'm through talking, okay?
You never understood the concept of time.
What day is it?
- Sunday.
- When did you say you'd be home?
- Friday.
- Thursday, Sam.
I meant Thursday.
Thursday and Friday sound so much alike, even I confuse them.
Why didn't I go to Atlanta like I said I would?
You're decent. If you put the bags...
Fuck you.
You said you'd be home Thursday, so I could fly Friday...
...buy a toaster, treat myself, and maybe on Sunday have a day of rest.
Now I must go to the airport.
I won't get in until 7.
It'll be too late to buy a toaster.
You know what? I can't unpack, because
I have a welcome cocktail party at 9!
Lewis, move over.
Move!
- Get over!
- You're scaring him!
Lewis.
That's because you let him on the sofa.
Here.
We can go now.
How long are you keeping the dogs?
They're going with me to Atlanta.
They're my dogs too. I miss them.
Do you want them?
Either they go with me or stay with you.
We can't share them.
Decide.
A negotiation.
Okay.
Wait!
You win.
Keep them.
Let's go.
Wait I just wanted to tell you something.
It's important.
Now I forgot.
- I'm gonna miss my flight.
- Wait a minute, I remember.
Remember that they like those medium-size bones.
I know, the little barbecued ones...
I know.
That's right.
You look tired, Sam.
Was it that bad in Zaire?
Could've been better.
You be careful.
I wish you luck.
You better tell him to go.
We can go now.
That's not what I said. You're not getting this. Try to be objective.
Let me understand this.
You didn't want the photos...
...but you wanted the dogs?
- That's not it.
You could have taken a photo of the dogs and solved everything.
I open my heart and you make jokes.
- I'm not.
- We had the dogs as puppies.
- They were cute.
- That's not the point.
- They're still cute.
- They were ours, and now they're not.
The dogs are probably a case for the Supreme Court.
I'm asking you if I'm right or wrong.
We're about to look at the most deadly virus we've ever seen. Think about that.
Right or wrong? It's a question.
She's got a new job at CDC.
No, she's got your job at the CDC.
- Good for her.
- Anyway, she's starting a new life.
She's not coming back.
It's over. Move on, because, frankly,
I'm sick of hearing about it.
All right. What do you mean, it's over?
You really need to seek some help.
A divorce signed by both parties is strong evidence something is off.
Did she say it was off?
Know how I stayed friends with you both?
- How?
- I don't have conversations like this.
I'm not asking you to take sides.
She didn't take the dogs to be mean.
- I'm asking your opinion.
- What is this?
You didn't check your suit. It's torn.
Takes your breath away.
Thank you.
- Good morning, Colonel.
- Good morning.
I took the liberty of bringing in the samples.
An early riser.
I was up at 4.
Let's work. I want to separate and thaw them and throw them under the scope.
Done.
- We'll have results in a few hours.
- Good.
Listen to the way it rolls off your tongue.
Motaba.
You know, it sounds like a perfume.
One drop and you'll feel different.
Your lover will melt in your arms.
Here, try it.
Quick hands.
But not as quick as mine.
Don't mess with this stuff.
You must be ready for anything.
Nothing in here can't kill you.
Including the air.
Okay, sirs, here we go.
These are from an 8-hour period. Healthy kidney cells before meeting the virus.
In one hour, a single virus has invaded, multiplied and killed the cell.
In just over 2 hours...
...its offspring invaded the nearby cells here, and here.
Continually multiplying.
Jesus Christ, five hours?
It kills this fast?
These numbers can't be right.
Ebola takes days to do this.
Sirs, the numbers are correct.
I wish to God they weren't.
One goes in, millions come out.
And every cell is dead.
Now we see them individually...
...searching for their next victim...
...until nothing's left to kill.
Mark this day, Salt.
We could spend our careers waiting to see a new virus.
Sirs...
Mr. Motaba...
...up close and personal.
I hate this bug.
Come on, Casey.
You have to love its simplicity.
It's 1 billionth our size and it's beating us.
- What, do you want to take it to dinner?
- No.
What then?
Kill it.
Daniels won't like us going behind his back like this.
Then we'll kill him.
Lighten up. We have no alternative.
You're so goddamned sentimental.
That's the trouble with this country.
The micrographs are ready.
They're ready.
Oh, my God! It's our African friend.
It's back.
We have to be very careful now.
We wiped out a whole camp to keep this bug secret.
Lock it up. Shelve it.
You know about this,
I know about this, nobody else.
Get your friend Daniels off the case.
I don't want that nosy little bastard messing up 30 years of our work.
Is he in?
Just a minute, please.
Come in.
Would you please get us some coffee?
Would you like anything?
Why am I off Motaba?
Nothing for the colonel.
Sit down.
Didn't you say Motaba was contained?
It'll pop up again.
We don't have a blood test.
We don't know how it's transmitted.
There's a fresh outbreak of Hanta fever in New Mexico.
CDC needs help. We're sending you.
Send Peterson's team.
Don't tell me who to send, colonel!
I told Senator Rosales I'd send my best man. That's you.
Now get out.
We've got baseline information on it.
What am I going to do there? Trap rats?
We have the bug growing.
We isolated most of the proteins.
We'll have an antibody test soon. Casey put the bug into rodents and rhesus...
...and we'll know its genetic sequence in a month.
If you leave us alone, we'll map this guy down to its last gene.
The odds of Motaba causing any more problems are a million to one.
- I don't know that.
- You should.
You would if you didn't harbor this desire to face the end of the world.
It's the biggest thing we've ever seen.
Jesus, you're killing me.
- Fresh, brand-new virus.
- You're still killing me.
It's bumpy, baby.
It's okay, baby.
You'll be out of here in no time. I promise.
- When did you get it?
- Today.
- We still on?
- He wants it.
Oh, I see.
- So your ship came in again, Jimbo?
- Our ship.
Africa, land of great beauty and untold riches.
- Absolutely untold.
- Keep it that way.
Take care.
- Tell them to send an alert.
- No, I won't.
Why are you fighting me on this?
I won't base my first official decision on a hunch.
It's not a hunch.
I've got a lab full of dead animals here!
There's no response to intravenous acyclovir. They're all dead.
Of course! You stuck them with the same needle. Where's the evidence?
I don't need any, I've got a feeling.
Your feeling is in my notes.
This is very simple.
It kills everything in its path.
Tell them to put out an alert.
This sounds familiar. Is that an order?
You're turning a deadly virus into a family matter.
This is not personal.
I can't do this back and forth.
Once in your life, take a chance!
You know what? I did. I married you.
You hung up.
First it was the dogs, now we're fighting over a virus. I can't believe it.
What is the matter?
Music is supposed to soothe the savage beast.
What?
Oh, Christ, you little shit.
- Welcome back.
- Look, look.
Let's have a look.
You got the papers?
Papers. That's a good one.
Look at her. You asked for a monkey,
I got you one.
- What do you mean, look at her?
- What do I mean?
I told you a male.
No, you said, "she."
Client has a female.
He wants to breed them.
Goddamn! Jesus!
It's okay. It's okay.
All right, all right. I'll sell her cheap.
- Come on, help me out.
- We had a deal. You screwed up.
I can't even sell that one. Look.
It serves you right.
What am I going to do with her?
The warning will be in our report.
Colonel Daniels believes it is serious enough to send out a special alert.
Do you know how much it costs to send out an alert to 400,000 health workers?
In '89, he predicted Hanta and it hit.
I suppose I understand your allegiance to your ex-husband...
...but we both know...
...the chances of this virus showing up in the US are virtually nil.
Go on, girl.
Yeah, it's freedom.
Look at the trees.
It's like home.
There you go.
That's it.
Don't give me that look.
No, go on.
I'd keep you, but I'm already hitched.
Come on. Go on.
That's it.
This is Captain Carter again.
At this time you must return to your seats...
...as we're approaching Logan Airport.
Hey, buckaroo.
So cute.
Hey, mister.
Are you going to finish that cookie?
No.
You can have it, Sheriff.
No, no, Bobby, don't bother the nice man.
It's no problem.
I don't want no trouble with the law.
Jimbo!
I missed you so much.
You look like shit. What's wrong?
I don't know.
Something I ate, or something.
What is it?
Sweetie, talk to me, what is it?
Help!
Morning, Rudy.
Lucrecia won't eat beef wafers so we'll go back to veal.
What's wrong?
Rudy, can you hear me? Squeeze my hand! It looks like toxic shock.
- Fred said he was fine yesterday.
- Come on!
I read about some bad strep cases in Newsweek.
Maybe I should subscribe. Henry, get me a blood culture and a blood count.
Goddamn it, come on, Rudy!
A final score of six to three.
Shit.
Fuck!
What about AIDS or hepatitis?
We'll test the blood. Don't worry.
Should you give me gamma globulin?
I don't want to give anything to my girl.
Flowers would be nice on occasion.
- You should eat.
- You shouldn't eat that crap.
You know you want one.
You got something.
E. Coli outbreak in Michigan in a steak house franchise.
Fevers of unknown origin in Boston.
Their docs can't figure them out.
Wouldn't be African explorers back from Zaire, would they?
Yeah, right. No, just a couple kids.
No unusual travel.
Some atypical strain of Lyme and those Boston doctors missed the boat.
Lisa.
Get me on a plane to Boston.
Right in here.
Right over here.
James.
Jimbo, can you hear me?
We're here to help but we need to know how you got sick.
Can you talk?
Hello?
Were you in contact with any animals?
- Should we call a code?
- Turn it off.
- What is this?
- I'm here to find out.
- We'll need a post.
- No, I'm not gonna get what he's got.
- I don't do autopsies.
- And you?
- I'll do it.
- Oh, God, he's dead, isn't he?
- Oh, God!
- Honey.
- Don't let him die!
- We're doing all we can.
I need you to help me.
- Jimbo, say something!
- Look at me.
Alice, did Jimbo tell you anything?
Did he talk to you?
Very slow.
Maximum sharps precautions.
Slow.
Give me the scalpel. You assist me.
He worked at an animal quarantine facility in San Jose.
We're monitoring his co-workers.
The host could be there.
Don't let anyone out of that place.
We're isolating everyone. I quarantined the Boston med staff, girl's neighbors.
Christ, Sam, I opened this guy up.
It looked like a bomb went off inside.
His pancreas, liver...
...all the organs were liquified.
I should have forced the alert.
You tried.
Get tissue samples to both our labs.
I'll confirm it's Motaba.
- Is anyone else showing symptoms?
- No, not yet.
CDC has a Stage 3 alert out.
If there are any new cases...
...God...
...we'll find out.
What about the girl?
She died when I was in post.
She wasn't on the plane.
So the first time she had contact with him was at the airport.
Plane got in at 9:00. She was admitted at 6:00 the next morning.
We're talking a 24-hour incubation period.
- This thing moves so fast.
- That's good for us. We can see it.
Nobody gets sick soon, we're safe.
This doesn't sound like you.
- What?
- Imagining the best case scenario.
Why not? I still think there's hope for us.
Are you all right?
I'm gonna get something to drink.
What's your problem?
Water.
You must wait your turn.
I need water.
We caught it early, and you'll make it.
But I need you to fight.
Dr. Mascelli. Dr. Mascelli to ER, stat.
Look who's here.
You got to fight, okay, Henry?
Got to fight.
She got sick really fast.
I thought it was the flu.
She fainted. She's burning up.
They keep coming in.
What's wrong with these people?
I don't know, Emma!
Get me the county health department, now!
The passengers checked out clean.
No further infection at Boston Municipal.
We're in the clear!
Robby, Dr. Reynolds.
15 cases.
There's another outbreak?
- Besides the one in Boston?
- Why're you reluctant?
CDC and USAMRllD are the only agencies able to deal with a virus like this.
That's why I want to leave tonight.
Sorry, can't do that.
Why in God's name would you keep me out of there?
It's a civilian matter. CDC is on it.
Let them do their job.
We don't have a charter.
Fuck the charter. People are dying.
It's about you being a doctor!
It's about that sacred oath we took!
We're friends.
Yes, we're friends, but I'm also your boss!
I run this outfit!
You do what the hell I say!
I'm your boss. I have my boss. Clear?
Get your boss on the phone.
Tell him to put me on a plane before you two kill a lot of people.
I suggest you shut up now.
Don't forget who you're talking to.
I don't know who I'm talking to anymore.
Am I talking to USAMRllD, the Pentagon, the CIA, McClintock?
- Tell me who I'm talking to.
- This conversation is over.
You're going to New Mexico.
I suggest you get packed or whatever you have to do, and I suggest you do it now!
Who screwed up? Why wasn't my pilot given the new orders?
Ford called me 0200, told me to get my ass to Cedar Creek, California.
You're going to Albuquerque.
I'm not going to Albuquerque!
I'm going to Cedar Creek!
Get Ford on the phone and get him to confirm.
No, give me that phone.
- No, I better confirm.
- You know what time it is?
That's right. You redirect on my orders.
Call and change my flight.
Put your finger on the phone!
My stripes.
It'll be your ass if you don't call.
Finger the phone. Finger it.
Thank you.
Proceed to Cedar Creek with the 1st Battalion of the 8th Infantry.
We need transmission rates of possible carriers: Insect, marine, animal, human.
If it's spreading, we need to know where it's going and how fast.
And Billy...
...we're in a hold mode for Clean Sweep.
You and I both know we can throw these people a lifeline.
We must proceed with conventional containment.
And you must maintain an absolute media blackout.
Control your subordinates.
Is Daniels in line?
Yes, sir.
I'll believe that when I see it.
Anything else?
No, sir.
Good luck, Billy.
Bring in the supplies.
- What's holding them up?
- There they are now.
Ray Fowler, Chief of Police. Mayor Gaddis.
I'm Dr. Keough from CDC.
This is Dr. Aronson and Dr. Ruiz.
Cedar Creek is a small town.
We're like a family. Everybody's scared.
I know and we're here to help you in any way we can. I'll be in charge.
I thought he was in charge.
Hi, Robby.
We just set up the BL4 mobile unit.
Why're you here?
I thought Ford sent you to New Mexico.
He did.
We're keeping the patients isolated in here.
There's so many.
So many, so fast.
Apparently they all got it at a movie theater.
Dr. Daniels?
There's something you should see.
This way.
The patient was admitted a week ago after a car accident.
He's had no contact with anyone in isolation.
It's airborne.
- I'm Lt. Colonel Briggs. Welcome.
- Thank you. The Sit. Rep?
Since 0620 today we've established an outer and inner perimeter.
No one has violated our cordon.
Before that, I can't give any guarantees.
There are 2618 people in this town.
I want them all accounted for by 0900.
Guarantee me that.
We're on it, sir.
Quarters in here, sir.
By the way,
Colonel Daniels is in town against orders.
Locate him.
Arrest him.
Clear this area, now!
We have rights!
What're you doing?
You can't do this to us!
This is a different strain.
This one is the one we got from Jimbo Scott, the one from Zaire.
This new one is from Cedar Creek.
They look the same. But...
...closer...
...and closer.
See the differences?
The spikes here and here.
The protein code changed, allowing it to survive longer in the air.
So it spreads like the flu.
Casey, chain of death?
Assuming the new strain originated with
Seward. He infects the whole theater.
Go back further.
He's a medical worker. He was sprayed with a blood sample taken from Alvarez.
Alvarez tells us what?
Zip. He was dead before we got here.
But Alvarez died of the original strain.
Seward died of the new strain.
The virus didn't suddenly mutate, so...
...I think...
...that the host animal is carrying both strains.
Good.
Alvarez, Jimbo, what's the connection?
- I can't find one.
- Wait a minute.
- Alvarez worked at a pet store.
- I'm just learning this now?
We just got it.
If the host is there it may carry antibodies to both strains.
I'm at the pet store.
Salt, get on the new strain from scratch.
Casey, blood test.
General, you got a minute?
There you are. Colonel Briggs, take this man into custody.
We're in deep shit.
The virus has aerosolized.
What do you mean?
It's gone airborne.
- Would you excuse us?
- Certainly, sir.
You said Motaba is only spread through direct human contact.
I know what I said, but now we're facing a new strain.
- What?
- It spreads like the flu.
- Impossible!
- Fine.
Go to the hospital and see.
Go without a mask, you'll see clearly.
You got 19 dead, hundreds more infected and it's spreading quickly.
Isolate the sick, and I mean really isolate them.
Keep everyone else in their homes.
We are!
No, we're not doing it!
I just drove through 100 people!
If one of them has it, then 10 of them have it! If one gets out of town...
...we're in deep shit!
And we're already in deep shit!
Go ahead and arrest me!
All right, Sam!
Don't threaten me.
Or my crew.
Please.
Leave us to do our work.
All right, Sam.
- You were never here.
- No, I was here.
I followed the bug here.
I've always been here.
You remember that.
The US Army and the CDC report...
...that the virus which struck this California town...
...is being contained as they search for answers.
A quarantine has been established to protect neighboring townships...
...and extends to the Pacific ocean, just a scant mile away.
You are entering a restricted area.
Turn your aircraft around.
This is a no-fly zone.
Careful of the glass.
Return to your homes!
Do not congregate in the street!
Return to your homes!
Robby.
Could this be the host?
This monkey's sick. It can't be our host.
We need to run an ELISA.
Let's get back to the lab.
No one is permitted to leave the town.
Anybody attempting to do so will be placed under arrest.
I repeat, we are turning you around.
What the hell is Bobby doing?
Tommy, follow us.
We gotta get out of here. Kids, get down.
Remain calm. We are turning you around.
Get to the trees!
Halt your vehicles...
...then dismount.
They're bluffing. Keep going.
You have entered a restricted area.
We will fire.
This is your last warning.
They're shooting!
Damn it, people, there's no place to go.
Go! We're almost there!
What are they trying to do?
Get out of the vehicle!
Let's see your hands!
- All right, lady, get out!
- Move!
- How are we doing?
- Just a moment.
Tell me as soon as you got something.
Anything?
This monkey's been infected with the original strain.
No antibodies, nothing.
That means the monkey caught it before the mutation.
Maybe he came from Africa with the real host, or caught it at Biotest.
Not Biotest. CDC turned that place inside out. Motaba negative.
- Test it again.
- They know what they're doing.
Get your people over there, tell them to test it again.
And after they've tested it, tell them to test it again.
Welcome home.
Military have escalated the quarantine at Cedar Creek, doubling their presence.
Authorities remain silent about the details of the situation...
...continuing the media blackout.
We can only guess at the seriousness of the spread of the disease.
Our sources number the dead as low as 10, as high as 50.
It's like a war zone out here, and we can only imagine...
...the fear of the citizens of this once very quiet rural town.
Their voices too are silent.
All phone communications are cut off.
Those we can hear...
...those with information, will not speak.
It is, in a word, frightening.
A military curfew is now in effect.
Return to your homes immediately.
Anyone found on the streets after 1900 hours, or 7 p. M...
...will be arrested and confined.
Return to your homes.
You'll be safe there.
Return to your homes immediately.
The area's been secured.
All civilians are in their homes.
Only minimal protective gear is required for military personnel.
- Got it?
- I got it.
She was one of the first infected.
What's E-1101?
It's an experimental antiserum from Yale virology.
It might be worth a try.
I read the journals. I haven't read a word about E-1101. Where'd you get it?
You know I can call Yale in a second.
I want to save these people, too.
I'm using everything in the arsenal.
We have to work together, Sam.
Are we?
Are we what?
Are we working together, sir?
Oh, shit.
Don't waste your time making phone calls.
Excuse me.
Come here.
Give this to the rhesus and also put it with some virus and pull it apart.
What is it?
- What's it look like?
- It's not orange juice.
No, it's not.
Colonel?
What is it?
I don't know.
Maybe he'll tell us.
If you're feeling sick at all...
...hang a pillowcase or any piece of white cloth on your front door.
Soldiers will take you in for a test and you'll know the results in hours.
Early stages resemble the flu.
Coughing and high fever.
Anyone showing these signs should report them immediately.
Doctors have the situation in hand...
...and are working to find a cure.
I'll only be gone a few hours.
Well, I may have to spend the night.
You girls be good.
Make sure you brush your teeth before you go to bed.
- Don't touch your mommy.
- Oh, baby, I can't.
I love you.
Bye.
Positive.
Positive, damn it.
The whole damn town is infected.
This way. One straight line.
Down the hall.
Out into the field.
This way, folks. One straight line.
No animals have been removed from here in 14 days.
I double-checked the storage lists, the manifests, the vet profiles. Nothing.
Talk to every single employee.
Somebody's got to know something.
The source of this whole mess is there.
The host is there, Casey.
He didn't talk to everyone.
This coffee sucks.
- Why don't you get some sleep.
- Why don't you?
- I slept in July.
- I got work to do.
Don't tell me when to sleep.
I don't tell you when to sleep.
What happened?
Nothing.
I just got a sudden case of the willies.
I can finish up.
No, no, no, I'm fine.
I hate them willies, you know?
They should call them "the Sams", don't you think?
You're tired?
Yeah.
The best projection USAMRIID is willing to make for the spread of the virus is this:
...24 hours...
...36 hours...
...48 hours.
The curtailment must be viewed objectively.
Be compassionate, but be compassionate globally.
Thank you.
All right, all right. Please.
The President's ETA from the East Asia
Economic Summit is in 20 hours.
By then, he wants a recommendation from this group.
As I understand it, you want to firebomb the town of Cedar Creek, California...
...population 2,600, with a fuel-air bomb...
...the most powerful non-nuclear weapon in our arsenal.
The way it works, it explodes, sucks in all available oxygen to the core...
...vaporizes everything within a mile:
Men, women, children and one virus.
Destruction complete, case closed, crisis is over.
This Constitution of the United States,
I've read it cover to cover.
I don't find anything in it about vaporizing 2,600 Americans.
But it does say, several times...
...that "no person shall be deprived of life, liberty or property...
"...without due process."
So, couple things before Clean Sweep is even considered:
One...
...unanimous, unwavering support for the president on this one.
You must support the president publicly.
He goes down, you go down!
Secondly...
...I want an army of experts citing thousands of lab experiments...
...telling any idiot with a camera that there was no other way!
You got that?
No member of this government will go sneaking off to the Washington Post...
...telling them they were the sole voice of opposition.
If there's a voice of opposition out there,
I want him in here.
Those are the citizens of Cedar Creek!
Go on! Look at them!
These are not statistics.
They're flesh and blood!
And I want you to burn those into your memories.
Because those images should haunt us till the day we die.
1918. Remember your history, Donny?
The great influenza pandemic.
Circled the globe in nine months.
Killed 25 million people.
My father lost three brothers in that. So?
What if there were men who could have stopped it, but didn't?
How would history judge such men?
Oh, baloney.
FDR stopped Stilwell going into Indochina.
He caused the Vietnam War.
What does history say?
Truman dropped the bomb on the Japanese. Saved American lives.
Now revisionist historians say he dropped the bomb to scare the Russians.
Those men were at war, Donny. We're not.
We are at war. Everybody is at war.
I have a presidential green light on
Clean Sweep, and I am going forward.
These people are Americans.
2,600 dead or dying Americans.
If that bug gets out of there, 260 million
Americans will be dead or dying.
Those people are casualties of war.
I'd give them all a medal if I could...
...but they are casualties of war.
That's all.
Come on.
- Neal, is it?
- Yes, sir.
I have to ask you a few questions.
Have a seat.
Jimbo, Jimbo, how did he get it?
Maybe we're on the wrong track.
Maybe Alice gave it to him.
His tissue samples had twice the viral amplification of hers.
- So we're stuck.
- We're doing the best we can.
We're not.
Let's wait for the comprehensive results to come in.
Can I ask you a personal question?
Where are the dogs?
God...
Please don't say they're in a kennel.
Think I tied them to a tree and left a bag of dog chow nearby?
- That's what you did when you left me.
- Let's start over.
It's Alvarez, Jimbo, Biotest.
Jesus.
Look.
Guys, guys, the monkey. Turn around.
My sweet Jesus.
He should be dead by now.
The orange juice worked.
Not on humans.
Not on Cedar Creek Motaba. This monkey was infected with the original strain.
Right. You know what that means?
This is no experimental antiserum.
E-1101 was designed to kill
African Motaba.
And they had it all the time.
Come on!
How's his breathing?
He's going to arrest!
We need blood, fluid, oxygen, ice, now!
Let's go. Put it in his armpits.
Let me in.
- Under his armpits.
- Pressure.
I need his arm.
Temperature.
I need pressure.
What is his temperature?
We need suction! We need more ice, now!
Casey. Let me in there.
You slept long enough.
Open your eyes! Open!
Open! Open! Open! Look at me. Look.
Casey, right here. Here I am, here I am.
See me? There you are.
There you are. How you doing?
I had a wonderful dream, Auntie Em...
You were there. You were there.
Stay with me.
You were there too. You had a 106 fever.
We're going to take you down.
Stay with me. Don't fuck around.
How many brain cells did I kill?
How many? About a billion.
Now I'm only as smart as you.
What can we give him to kill his sense of humor?
We must get a line!
Hold him.
- Hold his hand!
- I got it.
Talk to me!
It didn't get past the outer glove.
Give him a line.
What?
Come here.
I was with him.
I should've known something was wrong.
- Did it pierce it?
- It did.
Let me see.
- Let me get some iodine on it.
- I did that already.
I did that, Sam!
Oh, God,
I know how to work with needles.
Why didn't I wait?
- Okay, listen to me.
- Not now, okay? Not now.
- Listen to me!
- There's nothing to say.
There is.
Watch it.
You knew about Motaba all along.
E-1101 was the antiserum.
You could've stopped this outbreak before it mutated. But you didn't.
We couldn't.
We?
We.
That's all you need to know.
You must tell me what the host is.
We never found it.
We had to synthesize the antiserum.
To protect the troops. But now the virus comes here and 2 kids die.
We could've stopped it then...
...but we don't because we must protect the perfect biological weapon.
But then the virus mutates and we can't stop it now and we could've then.
The decision was made in the interest of national security.
At the time, we felt we could afford a certain number of losses.
Robby's infected.
Sorry.
Is "we" sorry too?
"We" is responsible for a town dying.
"We" is a party to Casey dying.
My wife is dying.
Isn't she your ex-wife?
What's your point?
My point is your penchant for distorting the facts.
You and Robby are, in fact, divorced.
Who is "we"?
"We" includes you, Sam.
Unless you resigned from the Army lately.
You don't just do research and it ends there.
We must defend ourselves against other maniacs developing biological weapons.
That's how the game is played.
It was a terrible mistake to withhold
E-1101, but we're beyond that now.
We've done all we can as doctors.
We must go on...
...as soldiers.
You're gonna wipe out the town.
You'll eradicate that mutation and then your weapon's intact.
That's why the troops are moving out, right?
It's already ordered.
When is it?
2000 hours.
By order of the president.
The president?
He was advised by an expert panel of virologists.
I wasn't there.
It's not about a weapon.
When the president saw that in 48 hours...
...the virus could be on the White House lawn, he gave the order.
I wasn't invited.
If you had been...
...what would you have advised?
Ruiz called. He scared a security guard into telling him Jimbo...
...smuggled an animal out.
- What kind?
- He couldn't say.
It was small enough to fit in the back seat of a car.
We know it came in on a ship from Africa around September 1st.
That's something at least.
We must find that ship.
You better pack. We got work to do.
Colonel Briggs.
Daniels was here? In here?
- Yes, he was.
- Why wasn't I informed?
You were asleep.
I am never that asleep.
Now you find him and you arrest him.
We are so close now. We have a chance.
I know.
- Do you believe that?
- I believe you.
You must go.
Listen...
I don't know how to say this...
...but if I'm not back by 1800...
...and you're not symptomatic...
...leave.
- What do you mean?
- Leave town.
Have you seen the troops moving out?
They can't do that.
They're doing it.
Sir, I think we should go very soon.
Like, right now.
Let's go!
Where's Colonel Daniels?
I think he's upstairs!
Upstairs! Let's go!
- How many hours in flight school?
- 60 hours plus.
- Actual flying time?
- I was yanking and banking.
Anybody seen Daniels?
We're looking for Daniels.
Have you seen him?
Tall, big guy?
Sure.
There.
Let's see some activity on these birds!
We got four flights today!
I want a fuel 93 and a turn 91!
Yes, sir.
Where's your pilot?
General Ford just called.
We've got helicopter priority. Where is he?
My pilot, sir, he's...
Your pilot's what?
My pilot's taking a leak.
Taking a leak? No shit.
In that case we'll just wait in the Loach.
- Tell him to squeeze it off.
- Give him a hand.
Mr. Robertson!
Get out here on the double!
Anybody seen Daniels?
They're down below! Let's go!
Stop that chopper! That's an order!
Hold your fire!
Watch it!
Hit the decks, troops! We're airborne.
Com Center, Flightline.
Com Center, Flightline.
Shit.
Get us to San Francisco.
They'll follow, so go along the coast.
Fog might give us cover.
You've flown through fog, right?
I read about it.
Daniels just commandeered one of our choppers.
Dare I ask how?
Don't waste time thinking.
Find him. If he resists, shoot him.
- I understand.
- Wait.
- You don't have to do this.
- He's a carrier of the disease. Do it.
I'm doing it.
Go after him like this, the press will swarm all over it.
You're creating a panic.
You always have the wrong priority.
He's not infected. You know it.
He's been in direct contact with Motaba patients. Know something beyond that?
You should've arrested him earlier.
Launch AWACS!
- You sure?
- Yes, sir.
I got it. Back up, coming through.
Make a hole, people.
Back up.
Colonel Daniels from USAMRllD.
George from Sioux City, South Dakota.
Back of the line.
We got a terrible epidemic.
We're from Cedar Creek!
- Site of the viral infection!
- You heard about the virus?
Need we say more?
We need the bills of lading...
...from ships arriving from Africa in the last 3 months.
Shall I cough on you?
- Mrs. Pananides.
- Now you're talking.
I think these men need some help.
Biotest and paperwork have to be very careful. Live cargo, federal regulations.
Here.
Compare our list with your Biotest list.
- You ready? Number one, Petra.
- Same.
- Venus.
- Same.
- Patricia.
- Same.
Tae Kuk.
- Tae Kuk.
- No, sir.
- No?
- No, sir.
- Carried a monkey, delivered to Biotest.
- No, negative, sir.
It's not on the list?
That's our vessel! That's the boat!
- The Tae Kuk has set out to sea.
- So what?
How'll we locate it?
My friend's in the Coast Guard.
I can make a call, easy.
How close?
Closer than his wife would like.
Get me on that ship. It can't be far.
It just left this morning.
You want me to fly you out to sea...
...drop you on a freighter at sea?
With all due respect, that's idiotic.
- Idiotic? We're fugitives from the law.
- Right.
Idiocy is our only option. Find the boat.
So what is this?
She's a monkey. Her name's Betsy.
- A monkey? I could tell.
- I'm feeding her, see?
- She lives in the woods.
- Do a lot of monkeys live in the woods?
No, just Betsy. She comes to visit me.
Does Betsy like apples like my little monkey loves apples?
She does.
Tae Kuk, Tae Kuk, this is Army Helo 1350.
Say your position, over.
Try another frequency.
It won't work.
They'll be monitoring marine channels.
- We'll rely on the position report.
- Just don't be negative.
Affirmative.
You sure you got the coordinates right?
How much fuel have we got?
Don't worry. This bird will go
400 miles without refueling.
Wait.
There.
Tae Kuk...
...Seattle.
- That's it. Thank you, Mrs...
- What's her name?
- Pananides.
I can't land on that ship.
Get me on it.
- I'll get you close enough.
- Close enough for what?
Close enough to jump, sir.
You're not serious.
All right, you fly, I'll jump.
No, just get closer.
Just get...
...very close.
That lifeboat is your best shot.
How do I get back up here?
Get them to clear me an area.
Or I can throw you a rope.
Just kidding, sir. Trying to keep you loose.
Closer!
Get me closer!
Does anyone here speak English? English?
- Little.
- I need information...
...about an animal that was on this ship.
You don't understand.
This is a medical emergency.
I'm an American Army doctor!
Doctor!
Come. Look.
Is anyone else sick?
No. No, sick.
Take me to this man's sleeping quarters.
Upstairs.
Where's his locker?
There's our host.
How are you?
I'm good. I'm good.
You should be nice to Sam.
You know he's got a big crush on you.
I'm so scared.
Would you please hold my hand?
I'm right here, Casey.
The president's scientific advisors assured me that there is no threat...
...of the further spread of this disease at the present time.
The two men who escaped from the quarantine this morning...
...are believed to be infected with the disease.
Everybody relax!
This is a military emergency! Back up!
It's all right.
Back up. Everybody back up.
This is a military emergency.
Stay calm. Stay calm.
Everybody stay calm.
That's them.
That's the guys.
Get a camera on them.
- Which camera do I talk into?
- Right there.
My name is Colonel Daniels.
I'm here with Major Salt.
We're not infected with the Motaba virus, but many are.
We've identified the animal...
...carrying the virus and need help finding it.
The animal who is carrying the Motaba virus is a monkey.
This is a photo of the animal.
Can you get in close?
Can you get a shot of it?
Get in as close as you can.
It's a small monkey, about the size of a cat. It has a white face.
Dark fur runs down its back.
Don't attempt to capture it yourself.
Don't go near it. What you can do is if you see this monkey...
...call this number at the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta.
The area code is 404...
...and it's 555-9653.
Again, if you see this monkey...
...don't go near it.
Hold your fire!
Right. Palisades.
Dr. Reynolds, I just want to make sure
I wrote it down correctly.
That's 211 Sycamore Road, Palisades?
And the woman's name is Jeffries?
Thank you.
Thank God she called the CDC.
What have we got?
Jimbo takes the monkey to Cedar Creek, tries to sell it but can't.
He drives to San Francisco, gets on an airplane for Boston...
...without the animal.
- Must have released it.
Between Cedar Creek and San Francisco is what?
- Palisades.
- That's it.
- We're there.
- There it is.
That's it. We're there, colonel.
We are there.
We intercepted a phone transmission.
They're headed there.
A potential screw-up you avoided among many others you have not.
Who should handle this?
You?
You kiss ass with the best of them.
- You hope to make General?
- Yes, sir.
You won't.
Now get me on one of those choppers.
She won't come.
She won't come, except to me.
I'm her only friend.
I trust you are the best helicopter pilot in this man's army.
That's a relief.
Viper 2, lead, left echelon.
Viper 2, line the skids, I'm at your six.
We're looking for a Loach 1350.
Make this easy for me, all right?
Have you ever been sick?
- Yes.
- It's not much fun, is it?
A whole lot of people are sick right now.
A whole town.
And you know how much you love your mommy?
That's how much I love my wife.
And my wife is one of the people who's very sick.
I want her to get better.
Is it, Betsy?
Betsy can help make everybody better because she has medicine inside her.
That's what makes her very special.
Do you understand?
You won't hurt her?
No.
She'll just go to sleep.
That doesn't hurt, does it?
No. Promise you won't hurt her.
I promise.
If I hurt her, you can punch me in the nose.
A serious punch.
For a very serious nose.
All stations this net, this is Viper 6.
The Commander in Chief has issued final authorization.
We are to proceed.
Some of us have doubts about what we are about to do. It's human.
But the fate of the nation...
...perhaps the world, is in our hands.
We are the last line of defense...
...and we cannot... we dare not refuse this burden.
I'm confident that each of us...
...each of you...
...will do his duty.
Viper 6 out.
Viper Command, Sandman is rolling. Over.
God forgive us.
Betsy.
Here, girl.
Oh, God, be careful.
He won't hurt her.
I can't stand this.
It won't be long.
There you are!
Careful. Careful.
Come on, Katie, move. Come on.
Oh, baby. Move!
Damn it.
We're approaching the destination.
This man's a carrier of the disease...
...and we're going to take him into quarantine at Travis.
Big Eye, Viper flight is airborne, do you see us?
Big Eye paints your flight at two.
Standing by, over.
Don't give me any shit. Listen carefully.
Put Ford on the phone, tell him it's Colonel Daniels.
Where are you?
We're on our way back. We got the host.
What?!
We found the host, Billy.
Thank God.
You must call off the bombing.
I'll buy some time, that's all I can do.
You get back here, quickly, safely.
You may run into resistance.
Resistance?
That makes it tough to get back safely, doesn't it?
Good luck.
Let's go.
- Problems, colonel?
- Of course!
Sandman flight, this is Viper 6.
Stand down, stand down. Return to base.
Viper 6, Sandman. Roger. Return to base.
Take a look.
- Is that resistance?
- That's resistance. Hold on.
- There's our Loach, sir.
- Where?
Army 1350, this is Viper lead at your 8:00.
Acknowledge. Over.
Viper, I hear you.
Army 1350 stand by...
...to turn into formation to accompany us to Travis.
On whose authority?
- Mine.
- Who are you?
Major General McClintock...
...senior officer in this area.
I didn't know you were behind us.
We have the host animal.
We're headed back to Cedar Creek.
You are to accompany me to Travis.
You don't understand.
No one is sick at Travis.
Don't make this difficult for me.
They're lining up in attack formation.
They want us down.
You don't want to destroy an Army helicopter in broad daylight.
With all due respect, if you do not follow us to Travis...
...l'll blow you out of the sky.
General, with all due respect, fuck you, sir.
Under my authority...
...go weapons hot.
Viper 2, This is General McClintock.
Go weapons hot.
Hold on.
We're going low.
Anything I can do?
Don't make me nervous.
The river goes to the right.
We must head them off. Break right.
Two, breaking right.
I don't see them. We lost them.
Shit! Hang on colonel.
Two is masked. No shot.
See that bridge?
Over or under?
You decide. I'm really not up to it.
- Hang on.
- I would have said over.
Wires! Two is off left.
What do I do?
Get him out of the air.
Don't go under the bridge!
You're missing him.
- Go into it.
- You're missing him.
Hang on.
We got it.
- If you're in trouble, I want to know.
- Hang on.
Warn me before you pull a stunt like that again.
I didn't know I was going to do it.
Where are you?
Viper 2 closing in on you now.
Pulled a 180, he's coming back at you now.
They're coming at us.
I'm going weapons hot.
- Holy shit!
- Break!
Break!
- Where's he gone?
- I don't know, sir.
Son of a bitch did that on purpose.
- Are those rockets on the side?
- They are, sir.
Fire a few into those trees.
Look there.
Lead, we got fire in the trees at two o'clock.
Verify.
Viper 2, can you get down there and search for wreckage?
Negative. It's too thick down there.
Big Eye, we think the Loach is down.
What do you see?
We had 3 contacts and then an explosion. Now we have 2.
Everything else is ground clutter on the highway.
Flying a little low, aren't we?
Avoiding radar, sir.
She's still out. How you doing?
Use the E-1101 as a road map to synthesize an antiserum.
Right away.
- We've got a lot of people here.
- I'll copy it big time.
I want liters of it.
I want everything ready if Robby responds.
You got it?
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.
There's no sign of wreckage.
We've been decoyed.
You son of a bitch!
How you doing?
You're going to be okay.
We found the host.
You don't have to say that, Sam.
No, it's true.
Would I kid you?
Salt's cooking up the good stuff.
Let's hang out for a while.
I love your face.
Keep talking to me, Robby.
Please don't leave me, Robby!
Don't!
Colonel, I got it!
- Your helmet?
- Come on, come on, put it up.
We got it.
You ready?
- Say when.
- Now.
I got it. I got it.
Get the lab geared up.
Make more. A town is waiting.
- It's going to work, sir.
- Go, go. Come on. The time's now.
You delayed the bombing.
More sentimental bullshit.
There's a chance we can save these people!
You're nuts. Sandman 1, Viper 1.
How copy? Over.
Send your traffic.
We had the antiserum and didn't use it.
That will come out.
I can defend that.
It's not about saving our asses anymore.
You are to proceed immediately with
Operation Clean Sweep. Understood?
Daniels knows about the African camp.
Roger, Viper.
Sandman is proceeding.
Her pressure's down.
It worked, she's normalizing.
But, sir, they're coming.
I picked up a transmission.
The plane is in the air. They're coming.
Come on.
Where are we going?
- Where are we going?
- I must talk to the pilot. Can we?
Yes, guard channel.
- Get this thing up.
- Where're we going?
I don't know.
- Get us in the air.
- Let's tell them we have the antiserum.
- They don't care.
- This is crazy.
They want their weapon.
- They'll kill everyone?
- Right.
- They'll watch innocent people die?
- Yes, they want their weapon.
Viper, Sandman.
We're commencing bomb run now.
3 minutes to target area.
Sandman. Bomb release is go.
I say again, bomb release is go. Over.
Where are we going?
I want to talk to the pilot now.
Go.
To the aircraft approaching Cedar Creek, this is Col. Sam Daniels. I'm a doctor.
Do you read me?
We read you.
Okay. You must not bomb this town.
That son-of-a-bitch, that little son-of-a-bitch!
This is Viper Command, you're being spoofed by com chatter.
Viper Command, Sandman.
Authenticate. Over.
Sandman, this is Viper Command.
I authenticate.
Juliette, over.
Your commanders do not have the current data. We do.
We have an antiserum being administered as we speak.
Every infected person will have their dosage, so you must abort the mission.
This is urgent. Do you read me?
You cannot bomb this town.
You must abort.
I'm talking to the bomber pilots.
Do you read me?
Do you read me?
Where is he, Briggs?
Can he prevent the bombing?
Can he abort their run?
If he gets in the way of the plane.
Get something up in the air and blow him out of there!
Now!
Can't we stop his transmission?
Do you read me? You must abort!
They've been trained not to answer you.
You hear me, don't you, guys?
I'll say it one last time.
These people that you're going to bomb are not the enemy.
We can kill the virus without killing these people. I swear on my soul...
...that the President does not have the facts.
He doesn't know we have a working serum.
Do you think he wants to blow up the town?
If you think I'm lying, drop the bomb.
If you think I'm crazy, drop the bomb.
But don't drop the bomb because you're following orders!
Your superiors have another agenda.
Don't you understand that right below you in Cedar Creek...
...there's a biological weapon they've been manufacturing for 30 years?
I guarantee you...
...that the disease has spread beyond the perimeters of this town!
People, we're in a state of national emergency.
We are under executive orders.
See it through.
If you incinerate Cedar Creek, you incinerate the serum.
Billy, can you hear me?
Why don't you do something?
Don't kill these people to protect your lie.
This is murder, anyway you fucking slice it!
If you manipulate the truth, the Constitution...
...then it's not just a town you're killing, but part of the American soul.
Billy, why aren't you at Cedar Creek?
This is General Ford.
I remind you that you are interfering with presidential authority.
Sandman has a specific line to the target.
If you are in his way, he cannot complete his bombing run.
Do you understand?
- Why'd he say that?
- Beats me.
Are you dumb or something?
You just told him how to stop the...
Okay.
Colonel, there it is.
I see it.
- You up for this?
- Yes, sir.
He's over the target area, please advise. Over.
We have final clearance.
Do not deviate. Over.
I'm talking to the pilots in the bomber.
What you're about to do isn't easy...
But I've told you the truth.
You will release that weapon on time and on target!
What you do in the next 30 seconds will be your testimony to life.
Sandman, you know what's riding on this.
Please, try to remain calm.
Okay, guys, no more words.
But we're not moving from your path.
Do you hear us?
I said we're not moving from your path.
I've never seen anything like this,
I swear to God.
Sandman, Viper Command...
I don't care if you fly through those bastards. You've been trained for this.
Hold your course and drop.
You'll have to take us out with you.
We're not moving!
We're not moving!
They're dropping it.
Thank you, guys.
Sandman, how did you release that weapon?
Viper Command, this is Sandman.
We have detonation over the water.
It might have been wind shear. Over.
I believe that you have deliberately contravened a direct order.
Now return to base for immediate rearming. Over.
Give me the microphone, general.
I beg your pardon?
Give me the mike, general.
Sandman, this is General Ford.
You will ignore that order.
For the record, I am relieving
General McClintock of command...
...for the crime of withholding vital information from the President.
I have in no way withheld vital information from the President.
- Colonel Briggs.
- Sir.
Place General McClintock under arrest.
If I go down for this, Billy, you go down for it.
It's out of our hands now.
You sentimental son-of-a-bitch!
Nobody puts me under arrest!
Nobody.
Colonel Briggs...
...what a wonderful moment this must be for you.
That was a good nap, kid.
You look better.
The gown becomes you.
- How're they doing on the antiserum?
- Great.
Cranking it out by the liter.
- How much are they giving the patients?
- 200 mls...
Is that what they gave you?
I didn't think I'd ever see you again.
I didn't think you'd make it.
It's a pretty unique experience.
Like living with me.
Would you do it again?
Maybe.
Now that I have the antibodies.
My poor baby.
Who has stolen the child's dream?
The mad genius Krank in his evil scheme.
To what vicious depths will he not descend?
Will the tale turn to tragedy... or have a happy end?
Step up. ladies and gentlemen!
Step right up! Come closer.
Don't be afraid.
See the strongest man in the world.
Look at those chains. made of the same steel... as that used to lift--
Yes, my friends--
The true light is invisible.
Penetrate the corridor of shadows... and you will enter the world of the chosen ones.
Renounce the gift of sight. l know there are skeptics among you... afraid to share with us the dead of night.
Be brave.
Renounce your gift of sight.
Pluck out your eyes.
Come and join us.
Help us build a better world.
The crusher Bones is going to try once more to shatter steel... only using the power of his mighty arms.
Please, ladies and gentlemen, l want absolute silence... during the demonstration. l must beg of you, for your own safety... not to look him in the eye... because his power of concentration is so great... that he might provoke a cerebral hemorrhage... in the weaker ones among you.
Mr. One, ready?
And now, attention!
Little thief!
Stealing money from orphans. l'll teach you !
Let go of that!
What's going on?
What's the matter?
The poor man's not well.
Don't move!
Don't move or l'll waste you!
Denree!
Kill him!
- Who's that?
- He's the strong man at the fun fair.
I don't know him.
What do you want? l have lost little brother.
He didn't come all by himself.
Well. well, kiddies, hard at work? lt looks like you're doing really well.
Thanks for waiting for us.
Thank you.
Just remember. my ears are so sharp... that l can hear you think.
Go buy yourself some sweets.
Don't overdo it.
Come on. Move your bum.
Go on. Here.
Move it!
Get the tools and let's beat it.
Move it!
Those rotten Cyclops.
Don't worry.
We know where to find them.
And him?
What about him?
You helped us out.
Here. Now we're even.
Hey. girl. Cyclops.
You know where to find Cyclops?
Will you get lost?
Beat it!
Happy birthday, Uuncle dear
Our wish is mosf sincere
We hope this cake of ours will bring you happiness
Good fortune and success
Wait till the candles are blown out!
In fair or foul weafher
We'll always be together
Happy birthday, Uncle Irvin.
A cake for me?
You're really too kind.
Are you ready, children?
Not you.
You've got a cold.
One, two.
What is all this bellowing about?
But, sweetheart, it's lrvin's birthday. lrvin's birthday?
Why, of course.
How could l have forgotten?
Let us celebrate.
Let us all make merry.
Everyone, let's shout!
Scream out!
Krank, come back. l had a thought last night. lf these children only have nightmares... it's perhaps because the evil is in you.
Why not seek the cause of your torment... in the molecular study of your own tears?
Who could make me cry?
Well. boss... we could make you cry with laughter. l aa a gnome a bag of bones
A man of means and full of beans
The girls in Spain sing my refrains l've such a pain that it's insane
You mustn't be angry.
Your brothers are doing their best.
My brothers?
May I give it a try?
Go ahead, mollusk.
Once upon a time, there was an inventor so gifted... that he could create life.
- Truly remarkable man.
- Ah. a fairy tale. l can already feel tears in my eyes.
Since he had no wife or children... he decided to make them in his laboratory.
He started with his wife and fashioned her... into the most beautiful princess in the world.
Alas, a wicked genetic fairy cast a spell on the inventor... so much so that the princess was only knee-high to a grasshopper.
He then cloned six children in his own image.
Faithful. hardworking. they were so alike... no one could tell them apart.
But fate tricked him again, giving them all sleeping sickness.
Craving someone to talk to, he grew in a fish tank... a poor migraine-ridden brain.
And then. at last. he created his masterpiece... more intelligent than the most intelligent man on Earth.
But, alas. the inventor made a serious mistake.
While his creation was intelligent, he, too, had a defect.
He never, ever had a dream.
You can't imagine how quickly he grew old... because he was so unhappy.
Boss.
There!
An eye dropper, quick!
An eye dropper!
Then the poor masterpiece became so crazed... that he believed a single teardrop could save him.
And, after committing many cruel deeds... he died a horrible death... never knowing what it is to dream.
Get out!
All of you, get out!
Good-bye, Uncle. Happy birthday.
See you tonight.
Silence... you glub!
What do you expect us to do with that? l wouldn't waste a nail to hang it up.
But it's pretty. isn't it?
Don't get smart with us.
The picklock won't always be there to save your behind.
All right. get lost.
- That's all?
- Afraid so. lf you keep being sassy--
You'll be sorry.
There's no shortage of orphans. Miette.
Listen carefully, Tadpole.
You don't want to go to the hole, do you?
- lt's very cold there.
- And pitch black.
And full of spiders.
So give us all the rest.
The rest.
There's a fine lad.
See? When you want to.
Now, the second shift.
The neighborhood's calm, isolated.
But be careful.
You never know.
There's a backyard.
You'lI go that way with all the stuff.
On the landing, there are three doors.
One is locked from inside.
That's the one that must be forced.
Behind is what interests us.
Here's the prize. lt's identical to the one where he hides his loot.
The problem with this safe: it takes two hours to crack it.
Two hours?
We're going to get caught.
We have no choice, unless you know someone capable of carrying it.
Somebody got in.
- You big idiot!
- He's right here now.
Do l pay you to sleepwalk?
Who is this guy?
- Don't ask me.
- l know who he is.
The strong man at the fair, the one who breaks his chains.
Are you thinking what l'm thinking?
Nice going, Mr. One.
One don't like whistles.
One not thief.
A thief? Who's a thief?
We're not stealing, just borrowing.
What he said?
He said you can take it back. lt just won't be as heavy.
- The true lighf.
- Little brother.
Renounce the gift of sighf and penefrate fhe corridor of shadows... the world of the blind.
That guy is crazy.
The Octopus will kill us.
Tell her l'll bring him back. l won't be long.
Help us build a beffer world... or we shall wifness a reign of ferror.
One! Where do you think you're going?
Cyclops truck.
Denree, little brother.
What about the truck?
Cyclops truck.
Kidnap Denree.
Kidnap little brother.
You know something?
You won't find Cyclops truck like that.
When you get there, someone will have eaten Denree.
The wolf will have eaten him.
Take a break.
No use wearing out your shoes. l know where the truck's going.
Miette and One together?
And then what?
And anyway. how old was this brother of yours?
Little, little brother.
Found him... one night... on his rubbish bin, crying.
One comes close.
Discover--
Okay. l can guess the rest.
He's just like l thought.
He's too little to bother.
Let's go.
We have to get out of here.
Stupid! lmbecile! ldiot!
Have you finished?
My crystal glasses are broken!
You'll crack my chandelier!
Are you calmer now?
One look for Denree.
See you.
Oh. come on, fat head.
- Where did those brats go?
- l don't know. lt's the big guy's fault.
Miette's different since he came.
Does he have all the jewels?
That's all he's interested in?
You had big ideas?
Poor little Tadpole.
You haven't fallen in love. too. like the others? Get to bed!
- Filthy brats.
- All the same.
We really can't count on them.
- Raise crows, they'll rip out--
- Your eyes.
- lt's the best ones who want to go.
- lt's not the first time it's happened. lt's always the same old story.
- Remember little Lucas six years ago?
- And Marcus before.
Yes, Marcus. l'd almost forgotten him.
- When we think--
- Of everything we've done for them.
And if she had an accident?
You never know.
At that moment. the winkles suddenly break into a dance... then cast off their shells and begin to use them as megaphones... to announce the concert.
Winkles. winkles.
Shells. shells.
And then, at that moment... all the winkles cast off their shells... and use them as megaphones to announce the concert.
The winkles?
The winkles cast off their shells?
Please continue.
Continue, and with colors as well.
Yes. yes. yes.
Then the hammerhead shark plays xylophone with the catfish bones.
The walrus plays the Jew's harp with the... the sperm whale's suspenders.
The sea is blue like the sky... and the sky is blue
Iike the South Seas.
And l don't know if l'm swimming in the sky or... or flying at the bottom of the sea. l swear it gives me the shivers.
Shivers? Shivers all over.
And igloos?
Oh, yes, tell me about the igloos. lgloos that turn into mushrooms.
Ah. it's you. my boy. l was expecting you.
Not so loud. Turn it down.
The boss might hear you.
The boss? He's out of a test tube, like all of us.
Lay the boy in the sarcophagus and come here.
But before--
Well, you promised me--
What's tormenting you, my son?
Well, this story that among us there's an original clone... different from the others. ls that true?
Of course it's true. The others are nothing but cheap copies... while the original one is unique.
- Unique?
- Yes.
And do you know who it is?
Do you really want to know?
Connect yourself to the child.
- To the child?
- Yes.
Connect myself to the child?
But l can't. lt's forbidden.
Exactly.
The others wouldn't dare, but you, you can do it... because you're the original.
Me? l'm the original?
But it's not lonely being the original?
All the penguins, the centipedes. everyone applauds.
Except, even if you climb to the treetops... it's impossible to catch the candy floss.
And so, everybody climbs to the top of the mountain... except the giraffes who, of course, stay in one spot... munching the clouds.
Sleep.
Sleep, my little one. l am the sandman... and you can't resist me.
Your eyelids are so heavy.
Sleep. my little one.
The snowflakes evaporate... and then turn into hailstones. ln the farmyards... the turkeys scramble towards... the hailstones.
The better to peck them?
And then when the children's voices cry for help... the chickens are merciless.
There.
Now he's going to come around very nicely.
- Who, the boss?
- No. the child.
He's a real nightmare factory.
- What's that? A fuse blew!
- Perfect.
Be careful.
Someone will hear you. lt's hard to be original.
Now, throw this message-- uh, bottle into the sea.
- Yes.
- Go on!
May soaeone find my plea fo get it over wifh. l...
Gabriel Marie... l came into this world with open eyes... but l saw a world... that was a world of dogs.
Litter of dogs!
And so, the creator... sent me down here to Earth... to recover the power... that men have illegally seized.
My brothers... you who have joined me in this struggle... understand that together we must fight... human beings... from their own grounds.
The world... of appearances. l thought we had agreed on half a dozen.
But you know it's becoming more and more difficult.
People are suspicious.
They've put up posters. ln any case. this batch is as fresh as they come.
Not one of them is over five years oId.
Listen. Let us have maybe a couple of hours... and we'll sort this thing out.
Only the third eye... will enable you to enter... the world of appearances.
But beware... because this sordid world of temptation and perversion... is also the world of desire.
Try. Brother Angel Joseph... to discover it... without your losing sight... of the only true light.
Be strong.
My brothers... our grace... our great superior race... shall reign once more... on Earth !
From that day on... our faithful third eye... will become useless... as the world of appearances... will be abolished. lt's Denree. l see!
What's that?
That, Brother Angel Joseph... is a female.
- A female.
- Do you have a problem?
What's that?
That is a condemned man.
Take them. Go on !
Come back when those idiots have had enough.
Search her!
What is it?
Kill her!
She's clean.
Then tomorrow night at Pier 24.
We'll never get half that.
One more scrap of information.
A girl in a red dress... with a big moron.
We found these on them.
But there was much more in the--
What'll you do with them?
A midnight snack for the fishes, tonight. Pier 24.
A midnight snack for the fishes.
- lrvin?
- Such a migraine.
You know all about feelings.
Won't you try to help me?
Won't you explain why all those children only have nightmares?
'Cause you were their nightmare.
You can persecute all the children in the world... but there's one thing you'll never have.
- What?
- A soul.
Because you believe you have one?
You don't even have a body.
He who created us made us all monsters.
No, Krank, you're wrong.
You are the only monster here.
Be quiet!
He's the only one responsible.
For that, l say l'm innocent. l'm innocent!
Anyway... l thank you for your help.
Hurry up! And don't break any of the baubles.
Well done.
And don't cut yourself.
Are you sure that we're doing the right thing?
Of course, my pet.
All children love it.
Lift your elbow.
Why worry, Krank? lf you're sincere. you have nothing to lose.
How are you, Marcello?
What's it to you?
We need you. Marcello, and your creepy-crawlies.
Have you still got the knack?
No, pIease, not again. l paid enough already.
- Nice place--
- You've got here. Marcello. l'm glad to see it hasn't changed much.
You know, l never liked that blue cage.
You were always so kind to us, Marcello.
- lt's only fair--
- That we look after you--
Today.
- A little girl in a red dress--
- With a big moron.
We want him.
And what do l do with her?
A midnight snack for the fishes.
Come on, my little flea.
There. there.
Easy does it.
Midnight snack for the fishes.
Will you shut up, you idiots?
- lt wasn't me.
- l don't care.
Work this out among yourselves.
How dare you hit the original.
You, the original?
Have you looked in the mirror lately?
Miette...
One will die?
You're born in the gutter.
You end up in the port.
Miette too little.
Not as little as all that.
Five thousand on the kid.
Ten thousand on the monster.
There are pebbles in the meat pie.
There are pebbles, bits of--
- Did you hear anything?
- Just them crazy birds.
- There's something over there.
- l don't see anything.
- Who is that guy there?
- What's all that monkey business?
Well, Brutus.
- l can't see anything now.
- Don't you like the music?
What you doing? l can't see. l don't want to be dead.
Jump! Go on! Jump!
Save Miette!
Hurry! Jump!
Found, West Pier. eve of St. John.
Oh, it's a miracle!
She's come to.
Spit!
Feel better? Look at me.
Are you alI right?
You're very lucky that l came by.
Haven't l seen you somewhere? l doubt it.
No one ever sees me. l'm always underwater.
Why? lt's dangerous up there.
- He wants to kill me.
- Who? l can't remember anything.
Some people lose their marbles.
And me, l've lost my memory. l'm glad you're here. l bring in more than enough stuff for two.
Look.
You see, l'm a treasure hunter.
The city's history is here.
Cast into the sea and forgotten forever.
- l see.
- l'm here, cataloging, dating.
Wait. That's the land shark's safe.
Oh, yes.
Yes, l brought it in yesterday.
And this is Vito Nine Fingers.
Everyone thought he ran away with his money.
They're wrong.
What are you doing? l stole them. l'm taking back what's mine.
Don't go back up there. lt's dangerous!
You're a kid.
Stay with me.
Well, thanks for everything, but l've got to go.
Not that way.
- The children.
- What about them? What do you know?
He takes them.
The devil takes them away... in his boat.
He takes them to hell.
- What hell?
- The Tattooed Man, he knows where.
The map.
The map of the minefield is tattooed on his body. lt's all my fault.
This man's a proper nutcase.
Holy cow, it's little brother again.
Miette.
Take care of him.
He's hopeless.
Sure.
What's the trouble, handsome?
There's no reason to be depressed.
- What?
- The girl--
Yes. The girl drowned. l wasn't going to resuscitate her.
- You should be twice as happy.
- Why are you sniffing?
Why l sniff? So what? l caught a cold at the pier.
- Gef ready in half an hour.
- ln a half hour?
Cyclops truck kidnap little brother.
Kidnap Denree.
Very funny.
What are you doing here?
Well, smarty, it wasn't nice of you to disappear. l'm sorry, but incredible things happened to One and me.
No kidding?
The Cyclops are stealing the chiIdren.
Yeah? And if you want to know, that doesn't seem to bother Mr. One.
He's picking up girls.
- Who says so?
- Pipo saw him.
- That night.
- ln the bar.
You're feeling a lot better already.
You can handle your liquor, a strong man like you.
That body. hard as a rock.
May l touch you?
Oh, wow!
Pretty nice. l don't like to brag. but they haven't failed me yet.
My little angel.
Little angel.
Life's a real bitch.
Feel better?
You're not cold?
You kidding?
You're a real radiator.
Radiator.
You should be ashamed of yourself!
Of course Miette!
You expecting Santa Claus?
When you're through being ridiculous, maybe we can talk.
Oh, well, there's no problem. l'll leave you.
See you later, Mr. One. l know where your brother is.
Why. you're absolutely smashed. lt's really you.
- But how did you manage to--
- You won't believe me.
Tell me about it.
- No, l have to take him back.
- He's too heavy.
See what state he's in? You won't be able to carry him all alone.
- Maybe you can help me.
- Me?
Yes, but for real this time. l'm embarrassed.
You know l didn't do it for money. l didn't betray you.
What's she doing?
Quick. run !
Go on. run !
They think you drowned.
Let them go on believing it.
We have to do something.
Lower him!
Get him!
Careful!
Great!
- A job well done.
- Trapped like a big, slobbering fish.
What's the matter?
What did he do to you?
- What did he do to you?
- You're inseparable.
- You must be in love.
- Think you're funny?
He's a grown-up, and you know it.
He may be big. but he's not grown up.
And maybe you're not so little either.
- Or you. or you.
- l am.
Okay, we get the message.
- See ya.
- Bye, Miette.
You'd better get going. lt'll soon get dark.
One?
You asleep?
What did you do before?
One sailor.
Harpooned whales.
One night...
One hear whales singing.
After... always the target l miss.
One loses job.
What's it like to have a little brother?
Keeps you... running.
Well, he can't complain he's got nobody to worry about him.
Denree-- little brother.
Miette-- little sister.
What are you doing?
Radiator.
Okay, Miette?
You had bad dream? l saw that woman again.
You know, who steals children.
There were huge balls in the port... full of spikes.
Mines?
The Taftooed Man knows where they've taken thea.
The map of the minefield is tatfooed on his body.
You were a sailor.
You should know about tattoos.
Big strong guy.
Kinda stupid.
Now that rings a bell-- with red hair.
- And hands like a baboon.
- He was supposed to deliver him.
We sent him the trumpet.
He brought it back empty.
- Nothing!
- But he took my sight, l swear!
Shut up!
- The beacons. Don't hurt them.
- Would we do that?
On the contrary.
Finish him.
Those sluts.
Always naggin' at me.
Boss?
- The boy ate your dinner.
- lt doesn't matter.
You were hungry, no doubt, my angel. Come closer.
No violence. Mishinka. After all, this young man is our guest.
The merciless burden of solitude.
And no one-- no one is spared.
Not even great minds.
And that shows... just how much l appreciate a visit... that's as spontaneous as yours. l'm glad l have no ears to hear such nonsense. lt's getting rather late for lrvin.
He becomes so tired. l'm sorry. Uncle lrvin.
Tell me... are you susceptible to the influence... of the fuIl moon?
And to the werewolf?
You're only sensitive to your nutritive urges.
You're not at all terrified of me.
You and l were made for each other.
You are the little boy that l need.
Let everyone know.
There.
Tattoo artist there.
Fifteenth one we've seen.
Hey, Cro-Magnon. slow down! l'm pooped.
For every step you take, l take three.
Tell me... after you've found your little brother. what'll you do?
Don't know.
Find work.
House.
One day... take wife, maybe.
Well. what kind of wife?
No hurry to choose.
Need time to find shoes One's size.
''Miette for life.''
Are you sure you don't remember?
He was a sailor who worked the minefields. You tattooed the map on him.
He will be most honored to answer your question.
What on Earth is that, Mama? lt can't be a submarine. lt's going through the mines. lt's the Messiah.
The Messiah has come to save us.
The Messiah walked on top of the water.
Two hands are better than one.
Hello, Miette.
Oh. no!
Don't say you've forgotten us.
Days and nights without news.
- We were beginning to worry about you.
- Don't bother.
We're never coming back.
Right, One?
Truer words were never said.
You'd better give us those jewels. quick.
Good work.
Very good.
Now we'll play a little tune for you in our own way.
A farewell tune.
All right?
He's killing her.
Will you keep quiet?
Shut up, l said!
WilI you shut up?
There's been an accident!
The two little brats got away, Zee.
But it's not over, is it?
They're hiding.
- And why are they hiding?
- Because they don't want to play.
So that's why they hide.
Why, it's you, my little flea.
Tell me where you've been.
How horrible.
What's the Octopus doing?
Scratch.
Go on.
Be careful.
- You got stung, you bitch !
- Bitch!
Bitch yourself!
Die!
Let go!
You're hurting me!
Die, you crazy witch!
- Why must you look like me?
- That's not true! l don't look like you! lt's you who looks like me!
You old hag! l'm going to kill you! l'll kill you first!
- l'll tear your nose off!
- Die! lf l die. you die too!
Think you can live forever.
Always better than anyone else.
You ugly old bitch!
Not a migraine tonight. l want you in impeccable condition.
Your concern is really touching.
Has the boy put you into such good spirits?
A perfect specimen that is totally uninhibited.
Tonight is my last chance.
What is it?
The thing is here, Mama. ln the house.
What do we do now?
Don't you panic!
Are you men?
Yes or no?
No.
Well, that's enough! lnspection and report!
The explosives!
They've disappeared. lt came from there.
There must be a passage.
Too small.
Mouse hole. lt's worth a try. l'm off.
We're really starting to get attached.
Concentrate on my voice, Krank.
You're sinking into sleep.
You're falling into a void.
Always deeper.
Together, we shall open a door.
Please don't hurt me.
Don't hurt me.
Good-bye. grasshopper.
- You, Professor.
- There's no more professor, Martha.
Just a terrible mistake. lt must be erased.
Say, l recognize you.
So, little crayfish, huh?
You fell into a strange net. huh?
Run.
Run before it's too late.
- Does it hurt?
- Yes. l'm allergic to steel. lt's nothing. He'll erase everything. like a mistake, you see.
He explained it to me.
You'll feel better after.
Yes. He really knows.
- He's the original.
- What are you doing?
- l found him.
- Who?
There.
- The original.
- The original?
- Quite a shock, no?
- The original.
That's the original.
But l'm the original. lt's me!
- No, l'm the original.
- Smell that.
33% sodium nitrate,
20 glycerine carbonate and S02.
Very strange. You remind me of someone. All of you.
Well. come on.
- Back to work, huh?
- Hey! And the kids?
- You've forgotten?
- Of course! The little children. l came for them. l even brought them this.
And this.
Give them back to them, huh?
Come on! Let's go!
Please, help me!
Which is the way out?
Miss?
Miss?
The passage there.
Take the key. Here.
But don't hurt him.
Go save the children.
Here you are at last. l've been waiting so long. ls someone there? l'm the one speaking. ln the fish tank.
Come closer.
Don't be afraid. lt's you who's speaking, mister?
The mines.
The oil rig in your dream.
Remember?
That was my message.
Don't try to trick me, too, mister.
Get up, little brother.
We have to go.
- Wake up, now.
- Oh. no! You'll kill him!
He's under a spell.
There's only one way.
Go find the child where he is-- in the clutches of evil. lnside the dream.
Look, no hands! l don't believe this.
What am l doing here?
Don't worry.
Everything will be all right. lf you say so. mister. lt's funny. l don't even know the little brother.
But l know you.
The little brother could have been yours.
Don't be afraid.
Just relax.
Now. close your eyes. listen to my voice... and sleep.
Be brave. little girl.
Who are you?
Why are you in my dream?
- Why is it his dream?
- Because he's not afraid of me.
Please let me take his place.
What would you get in exchange?
A brother. lf l take his place, maybe l'll see his big brother again.
You are trying to trap me, aren't you?
You don't risk very much.
So be it.
Well, my chickadee, huh?
Sometimes it's better to land in the muck, huh?
Hey, you'd better get out of this place. lt's going sky-high! l had a weird dream. l was very, very old.
And you were dead.
The void equals infinity!
Oh, no, Uncle!
Heave, ho!
Row faster, guys! lt's following us!
What do you mean, following us?
Untie the bowlines, idiots.
Come back! lt's me!
Your creator! l made you ! l gave you life! lrvin ! You hear me? l order you to come back!
It shouldn't be here.
Moving on to...
Wolf 336, F-class star... at right ascension 7.36.7.
5.21 declination.
I thought that was the last one.
Why'd you think that?
You said that it would be.
No, I distinctly remember forgetting that.
I don't know why
I put up with this.
Yes, I do.
Because I let you drive.
I'm a ride-share hostage.
F-class star.
Recent variability.
14.6 light-years away.
This is nuts anyway.
The whole approach.
SETI's tough enough on microwave band.
Now you want to search FM?
With all that noise?
Might as well look for a needle in a haystack... of needles.
Station Five.
Is my voice even vaguely familiar to you, Zane?
Honey, I'm trying to get out of here, but as usual, Calvin's holding me up.
Should be home by 1:00, 1:30.
1:30, Tuesday? Wednesday?
A.M.? P.M.?
What can I say?
I'm a ride-share hostage.
I'm going to go pee.
I will try to...
Where are you?
I'm having a drink with Becky.
You're in some bar, while I'm here working?
There's a cute hockey player here too.
But he's only in town for one night.
All right. I give up.
What do you want?
I want your ass in bed, Zane.
Okay. I'll leave now... if you leave now.
But do not talk to any strangers on the way out.
I'll see you at my place in 83 minutes, okay?
Swear you'll be there?
I don't want a repeat of last week.
If I say I'm going to be there, I will.
End of story.
There is nothing more important to me right now than our...
There is nothing more important to me right now than our...
Good solid spike.
Nice symmetry to the modulation.
Detection protocol. Now!
- Confirmation Phase One.
- Swing dish five degrees off axis.
And signal fades. Looking good.
Now swing dish back on target.
Signal returns. Definitely sky based.
Wolf 336, you are howling.
Phase Two!
Initiating software check.
Jumping ahead to Phase Three: second source verification.
Who's still on line?
Green Bank? Ohio State? Moffet Field!
Checking. Still checking.
Be there. Just be there.
We got to get another ear on this.
Software self-checks.
Phase Two complete.
Come on, Moffet.
You're killing me. I'm dying here!
Just pick up the phone so we can confirm this.
Nothing.
Zaminsky!
Zaminsky!
This is not valet parking!
Stalled out on me.
Stalled on me! This piece of...
Sorry, sir.
Sorry.
That's it?
Forty-two seconds.
We listened all night.
All night, all morning, and the sound never repeated.
It's 42 seconds of nonrandom, non-Earth-based signal!
This could be it, Gordy.
Sounds compressed, like a military burst communication.
No way. No way.
Not at 107 megahertz.
107? What the hell are you doing so far below the microwave?
Good question.
So this is a variable star, this Wolf 336?
14.6 light-years away.
All right. Okay.
So if it is a variable, it expands and contracts dramatically.
So, gentlemen, maybe you can explain to me... how intelligent life can actually develop in such a volatile environment.
It's only been unstable for what?
Fifty years or so.
Which means it's possible some form of life could still exist there.
Exactly.
Maybe this is a distress call.
An S.O.S.
Maybe they're sending out their Encyclopedia Gallactica... jettisoning all their knowledge before it goes down with the ship.
It lasted 42 seconds, and it never repeated.
That's why we have to stay on this one,
Gordy, in case it does.
I'll pull double shifts.
I'll pull triple shifts if I have to.
But I want priority status and dish time. Serious dish time.
During normal business hours, preferably.
Calvin, why don't you go home, get some sleep, okay?
Go ahead.
It's a mandatory 20% cutback.
Tracking station has a fixed operating cost. I can't touch that.
- I've got to look at personnel.
- Are you even shitting me?
I can swing a month's pay, instead of two weeks.
Maybe extend the health benefits two weeks beyond that, but...
Let me see if I got this straight.
I come to you...
I come to you with what may be... the preeminent discovery of the 20th Century: the possibility of extra-solar life.
And I get shitcanned for it?
I know how important this is.
But searching for E.T. s in this political environment... is a tough sell on Capitol Hill.
If we don't start spending money on harder science, we're going to lose it.
Let's forget about me for a second.
What about the signal?
I'm skeptical.
But it is interesting.
I'll pass it along to decoding.
See if there's a pattern recognition there, but...
I don't have to tell you.
You know the rule.
- If you can't confirm it...
- Then it doesn't exist.
What asshole made up that rule?
Can we fire him instead?
It doesn't please me... to be losing the brightest and the best.
I wish there was another way.
I honestly do.
Well, it is finally cooling off in the Southland... after a day of near-record temperatures.
But hot again tomorrow and hot again on Thursday with no letup...
How are you doing for money?
If you need me to, I could...
No. There's a SETI program up north.
Guy who runs it, Bill Wyatt, was begging me to come up.
Might call him.
You're not really thinking about going back to it, are you?
We had a bell ringer this morning.
Really good signal.
I just couldn't confirm it in time.
You had something really good last year too.
Turned out to be what?
A broken microwave oven.
What's your point? There's always something to give me false hope?
- That I'm wasting my life?
- I didn't say that.
But, you know, it's interesting that you did.
Come on.
Someone is watching.
What?
How in the hell did I wind up with somebody like you?
I got tired of rich guys with good futures.
No. Really.
What is it you see in me?
What made you call me the first time?
Boy, when their self-worth goes...
Okay, I see a man of great intelligence... dedication, cute little kind of insecurity.
- A little paranoia...
- This went to shit fast.
Why do we always have to analyze everything? Can't you trust I love you?
Algorithms I trust.
Boolean logic I trust.
Beautiful women, they just mystify me.
Two years and we're still talking about trust? It's amazing.
I should shut the hell up, huh?
Look, it's your career.
I will support any decision you make.
But if we are going to make it... we've got to take care of our problems here on planet Earth.
That is just a little hard when you're always off looking at the stars.
Listening.
Listening.
Are we falling apart here?
Is that it, Char?
I don't know, Zane.
Are we?
How'd you do on the test?
How'd you do on the test?
No, I'm saying it's incomplete.
There's no chemical breakdown.
There's no broadband chart analysis.
Want me to go on?
That information isn't available at this time.
This information was promised me two months ago.
These are not national secrets.
This is a routine analysis of the atmosphere. Why should I...
There's a problem with that satellite.
It's blind to certain trace gases.
Really? As of when?
It lost a solar panel. Some functions were shut down to save energy.
Look, here's my problem.
I've devoted my sabbatical to greenhouse trace gases.
If I don't get this data, I might as well be counting cow farts in Montana.
You'll have to wait until the new satellite is in place.
- When's the launch date?
- NASA doesn't have that information.
Round and round we go.
Thanks for naught.
Moffet Field.
Bill Wyatt, Zane Zaminsky.
How are you, man?
Oh, yeah, Zane. Hi.
I know you said you'd get back to me, but I felt obligated... to let you know about a job offer that came up.
Telecommunications.
Looks pretty sweet too.
The health plan alone, you know.
Well, good.
You should take it, Zane.
I don't think things are going to work out here.
But I thought you were looking for radio astronomers?
Some good creative thinkers?
Isn't that what you said?
Creative's one thing.
Too creative's another.
I'm not tracking.
I'm not sure
I should be saying this.
I talked to Phil Gordian at J.P.L.
- The indication was...
- Just say it.
He said you were faking signals in order to keep your job.
I do believe this permit's expired.
Why haven't you?
To raise the temperature of the planet tenfold...
To raise the temperature of the planet tenfold... to change the atmosphere into one suitable to colonization... to construct farms and cities... and build an infrastructure capable of supporting thousands of colonists.
Make no mistake.
Never before have we undertaken a task...
Have we undertaken a task of this size.
- The terraforming of Mars.
- Do you know who Phil Gordian is?
The key to all of this is polar ice.
Enough heat-generating factories could be built.
The heat would be enough to melt...
Excuse me. But perhaps you'd care to use the microphone?
Yes. Yes, I would.
Thanks.
Phil Gordian?
Has anybody seen him?
I'm looking for Phil Gordian.
Anybody seen Phil Gordian?
The man was in the middle of a seminar, Zane.
Why don't we step outside?
Let him finish.
Did you even give it to decoding?
Did you even see what was there?
Why don't we take this outside?
If you're not going to analyze it,
I want my tape back.
I'm sorry. I don't know what you're referring to.
Why don't you show me how smart you are by leaving right now?
What's going on, huh?
What are you doing this for?
- Back it up. Let's go.
- Why are you telling them lies about me?
- I said, now! Let's go!
- Why?
- Come on. Let's go.
- Why?
I'm sorry. He's a troubled young man.
A very troubled young man.
My apologies. Please. Continue.
Where was I? Polar ice.
After the polar ice has been melted... the atmosphere begins to grow thicker.
Finally, a kind of critical mass is reached.
At this point, the atmosphere begins to work for us.
- Station Five.
- Tell me I'm not losing my mind.
- Just tell me.
- Zane, where are you?
They're acting like it never happened.
I saw Gordian.
It's like we never gave him any tape.
- Listen, Zane...
- But then I remembered.
It should be on the backup DAT system.
We should have a copy of the signal.
Well, yes and no.
There are some D.O.D. guys here... going through our stuff as we speak.
Apparently, it was a burst from a spy satellite.
- What?
- It's a defense thing.
Which is probably why
Gordian couldn't tell us about it.
We weren't cleared for this spy shit.
Cal, listen to me very carefully.
Satellites do not move like stars move.
We tracked this thing in stereo time, in star time, okay?
I don't know who these guys are, but I do know they're lying to you.
Is this everything?
If you haven't told them about the backup system, don't!
We have it all?
Don't you tell them, Cal!
Don't you dare!
There...
There's a backup system.
Hey.
So if this was a spy bird, why was it moving like a star?
Not really sure.
We'll have to get back to you on that.
It's a very aggressive company.
With the federal mandate for air bags...
It's a very aggressive company.
With the federal mandate for air bags... they are perfectly positioned to dominate the market for years.
Blade Co. Technologies.
All right. I'll send you a prospectus.
Are you at the same address?
Doug, can I call you back in, say, ten minutes?
- So I get this signal.
- How about 5:00?
- Signal from an F-class.
Like our sun but hotter.
- First they act like it's nothing.
- Great. Thanks.
Now they're going to unimaginable pains to make it disappear.
I thought you had a new job.
Something is going on here, Char.
Why the hell would they do that?
What is it they're trying to hide?
Maybe we could talk later.
I need to talk about this now!
- I called last night twice.
- I got the messages.
I thought the problem was
I wasn't around enough.
Now that I am, you're not.
What is this, Tales From The Dark Side?
I have been avoiding this. Yes.
Okay. Define "this."
The brokerage is strongly suggesting
I head up the office in San Diego soon.
- It'd mean moving there.
- Can you tell them no?
Thank you. I tell you I'll support any career decision you make.
- But when it comes to my work...
- You're considering this?
Char, it's Mr. Morgan on line five.
And?
I got to take this.
By any chance is he going to San Diego also?
Why don't you stick your paranoia back in your pants and get out of here?
- I will call you.
- Fine. No problem.
- When?
- Whenever I get to it.
"Tuesday? Wednesday? A.M.? P.M.?"
Go!
Right now.
They could be talking to us right now.
An array.
Phased array.
Good morning, Mr. Carbiner. I'm Horace with your local satellite company.
Good morning.
Can I see your dish?
What a glorious morning.
Hot enough for you?
For a limited time, we're offering a free upgrade on a totally automated... fiber-optic control system.
All this at no extra cost to you.
No extra cost to you.
One of the many ways we're improving the quality of service to our customers.
Can I see your dish?
Jesus!
What are you doing here?
And how soon can you leave?
- What are you doing here?
- I live here. Do you mind?
I mind you grabbing on me.
Let go!
- I'm trying to help you down.
- I can do it myself!
- My butt is stuck.
- You live next door.
With Mrs. Roosevelt.
That it?
I live in L.A.
Just kicking it here a minute.
I don't want anybody nosing around here.
If I were going to steal your stuff, it would be over and done.
What do you know about my stuff?
What are you doing climbing roofs at 1:00 in the morning?
Shouldn't you be out tagging freeway signs?
I don't got to tell you shit.
Fine. Hang there all night.
Hey! Where you going?
Get me down.
What are you doing?
I told you to wait downstairs.
What's this?
It's a cooling jacket for a low-noise amp. Don't touch it.
What's that blinky shit over there?
Will you just sit down?
Put this on your ankle.
I don't want that thing.
It's cold.
Just keep your butt down... your foot up and your mouth shut.
You can watch, but don't touch anything.
What are them dots?
They're satellite dishes.
Each one.
You string enough of them together, it makes one big radio antennae.
What's it do?
It lets you get close to the stars.
See if you get 92.9, K-BUMP.
Greetings from beyond the solar system.
- That, my friend, is Voyager 2.
- What's that?
Voyager is a planetary probe launched in the mid-'70s.
They don't teach science in school anymore?
Too busy patting us down to see if we're strapped.
I assume you mean guns.
They find one on you?
Not me. Just everyone else.
That's how come the folks want me out of L.A. Crazy stuff going on.
Can I come in now?
So, this is the star, Wolf 336.
We check the spectra at different magnifications... looking for anything unusual.
But, unfortunately, all we find is the typical radio noise of an F-class star.
But you talked to them before, huh?
The aliens? This channel?
This star, this frequency.
But we can't really talk. It takes years for a radio wave to get here.
So all we can really do is just listen.
But what'd they say? Before.
Maybe how to live forever.
Maybe how to make nuclear power safe.
I don't know. Maybe they were just ordering out for a pizza.
We won't really know what they're saying.
Not at first. But that doesn't make it less important.
If I can confirm this signal, if we can find it again... then we will finally, finally know that we're not alone.
I wonder what they're going to look like.
Warning: Your sleep period is over.
Get out of bed.
- Jesus!
- You going to try again? Tonight?
If you are, I could wait up and help some this time.
Didn't tell anybody about our little clubhouse, did you?
What am I? New?
What about your grandma?
She doesn't care if you stay up late?
- Not after 10:00.
- What happens at 10:00?
She passes out on cough syrup.
Tell you what, whenever I'm up there, you can come over.
But only, only if you got the proper I.D.
Where I get that?
What about me, huh?
When can I do something?
Okay. Hit that key.
- What one?
- That one.
- This one here?
- Yes.
- Are you sure it's okay?
- I'm sure it's okay.
- This one right under my finger?
- Give me your badge. You're fired.
I'll do it. I'll do it.
- What's this signal going to look like?
- It's just a spike.
A big one or a little one?
Because I got a big one.
That's it.
That's exactly what Calvin and I saw.
Come back!
I didn't touch nothing, okay?
That's the same thing.
Same signature, same periodicity.
What the hell?
- What is that lambada shit?
- It's got to be a bounce.
Radio wave kicks off the inversion layer, comes back in through the system.
It's coming from Earth?
Some Mexican radio station on the same frequency tells us... where the bounce came from, but it doesn't...
But it's wack. All of it?
Wait a second.
The first signal was definitely sky based. We verified it.
But this one is Earth based.
Two identical signals.
One comes from space, the other from Earth.
I'm all screwed up here.
It doesn't make any sense.
Unless they're talking.
Last night you were telling me we couldn't talk because it'd take years...
Cal. I got to talk to Cal.
I don't know. Somebody said something about a faulty heater.
- Carbon monoxide.
- Really?
- Taking him to County.
- Yeah, sure, but this guy's D.O.A.
What have we got here?
Huge concentrations of trace gas in Central Mexico, Ecuador, Brazil.
Look. You can see for yourself.
700% increase over the last five years?
- How can that be?
- My very question.
How accurate is this data you sent us, Ilana?
It's hard to say. We cobbled it together from ground stations... weather balloons,
Uncle Earl's aching corns.
Some of your numbers are there.
- No satellite data?
- NASA's bird has a bum wing.
You've obviously got some ratty data.
We checked this as best we could.
George, run me a future cast, will you?
Say, ten years, assuming the same increase.
Of course.
This had better be wrong.
According to this, we're looking at an increase of 12 degrees Centigrade... over the next decade, and that's just...
- Catastrophic.
- I was going to say impossible.
But, yes, that too.
Central Mexico.
- Excuse me.
- You come to see the ruins, my friend?
I take you to some much very good places.
Let's just head for town.
When does it start to cool off down here?
In San Marsol?
This is cool off.
This dial right?
Right, left. Both ways.
This radio station?
You know where this is?
Very far.
Not close to town.
Let's go there.
How about the ruins?
You want to see the ruins?
The radio station. I need to go there.
I'm going to talk to the people.
Accidente, he say.
But no persons was here...
When the fire come last night.
I'm too late.
One day too late.
Posada San Marsol.
One of our much very best hotels.
You see those?
These TV dishes.
- You know of any big ones?
- Big?
Big. Not small like these, but big.
Fifty, sixty feet wide. Big.
"One of our very much best hotels."
This is Peter Dowling from Sierra Satellite.
Just wondering if you were sick or dead or something.
'Cause if you're not, you're fired.
Sorry, pal.
Yeah, Zane, this is Doug.
I heard about you and Char.
I heard it was skidsville.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I know what it feels like.
If you want to get together anytime, let's do it.
We'll talk it through.
I'm there for ya, man, okay?
And would you mind if I got her number?
I want to talk to her about some investment possibilities.
All right? Thanks.
I called this morning.
Just didn't leave a message.
Are you there?
I guess I didn't get back to you that night... because I was mad, Zane.
I get so tired of being questioned about even the basic things.
I was feeling guilt too for steering you away from what you should be doing... from what you love the most.
But you were such an ass the last time we talked.
Damn. I can't remember if this machine lets you ramble... so I better just admit this quick.
I miss your weird paranoid brain.
Call when you can.
Where are you, Zane?
Move!
So just who the hell are you, huh?
Because I saw you in town.
I saw you at the airport.
You were waiting for me.
You knew, didn't you?
How the...
Where do you hide a 20-meter dish?
Research.
- Jesus!
- Hey!
Excuse me. Excuse me.
What's going on here?
I don't know.
These guys are stealing my stuff.
They're taking my equipment.
I was trying to work here.
Excuse me. What?
Take it easy.
Will you guys take it easy?
I know I should say thanks.
But that was a pretty dicey stunt you pulled back there.
You could have got us both shot.
You're welcome, and you're right.
I saw you in town last night, didn't I?
Zane Zaminsky.
Am I still bleeding?
A little. Ilana Green.
Damn! It's hot in here.
Think they'd have air-conditioning in this place.
I don't like blood.
Why were they rousting you?
Something about my gear they don't like.
- What is all that stuff?
- It's technical.
It looks like some kind of radiosonde for atmospheric sampling.
That's right.
That's absolutely right.
Just who are you?
Can I ask what I've done wrong?
I wish to apologize to you both.
We have overreacted in this matter.
As for the equipment, it seems to be ruined. If you give me a local number...
Wait. Why was I detained?
Why did these men take my gear?
- You were on private land.
- Isn't this a public facility?
Please try to understand.
This is a new type of power station.
With new technology come those who would like to steal it.
You're staying at San Marsol, yes?
What do you mean, "new type"?
You still burn fossil fuels, right?
With great efficiency, very few emissions.
- What kind of emissions?
- I'm not an expert in this matter.
Perhaps if you were to leave me a local number...
- Perhaps if you give me...
- Call it a push. Come on.
They say there's a twin for everyone in the world.
That's not it.
Roll the genetic dice often enough, they're gonna land on top of each other.
Trust me, Ilana.
That is not it.
Nice of them to bring our cars here.
Follow me back to town, and don't make any stops, all right?
I understand you do residential work.
I've got a little weeding problem
I'm hoping you can help me with.
It's really a very small job.
Here's the address.
We saw Gulf hurricanes in March.
Right now there's a drought in the Sudan, killing thousands.
So we're talking global warming, right?
Yes and no.
Yes in that we show an increase in global temperature over the last decade.
It's not much, but if you factor out the cooling effects of volcanoes...
It's happening.
Our factories can't pump out 7 billion tons of CO2 a year and not do damage.
This is the Arctic?
Ninety miles from the Pole.
What's it doing there?
Taken by itself, it's just another anomaly.
But as a whole... The Arctic is very sensitive to environmental change.
That's why we go there.
Things happen first in the Arctic.
It's like a window on the future.
So you're talking about something a lot bigger than global warming.
I see some major climatic ordeal happening.
God.
I get so damned apocalyptic when I drink.
But you have to remember, every major turning point on this planet... including the demise of the dinosaur, began with a shift in climate.
Even a ten degree increase... will melt 70% of the polar icecap... wipe out all agriculture.
Raise the temperature of the planet to change its atmosphere... into one suitable to colonization.
- Terraforming.
- What is that?
This guy at J.P.L., he's been giving talks about Mars... and how its whole environment could be changed... and how we can terraform it and then live there.
It'll never happen, of course.
It'd cost hundreds of billions.
But he did say something about...
After the polar ice has been melted... the atmosphere again grows thicker.
Finally, a kind of critical mass is reached.
What?
I don't know.
We might give him a call if it's not too...
Jesus, I did the time warp dance here.
Before I go around saying the sky is falling or even warming...
I've got to get new gear from N-CAR.
- When do you leave?
- First thing in the morning.
- You?
- I don't know yet.
I still haven't seen everything I need to see.
Maybe a couple of days.
I must say, Zane,
I really enjoyed our talk tonight.
It's uncommon to find someone who can grasp the things I'm passionate about.
Yeah, I hear you.
Where you staying?
I was in room 302 at the big pink place... until it merged with room 402.
- Some kind of an accident?
- Everything is lately.
- How is this dump?
- It's not bad with the lights off.
- Maybe I'll get a room.
- Well, look.
I'm gone early in the morning.
Why don't you stay here now and keep the room tomorrow?
You mean, share it?
There is a couch.
We could at least keep the appearance of respectability.
I suppose we could.
Not that I don't find the proposition intriguing.
Not that you just propositioned me.
Did you?
Boy, that's a lot of guilt for someone who hasn't done anything yet.
I take it there's a warm body in bed at home.
Out of my bed, still in my head.
I don't know.
I guess there's still something to be said for abstinence. You think?
In moderation.
Terraforming. If you find anything, get it to me, in care of UCLA.
I will.
What? Yes?
Just be careful.
Change for the phone?
Man, it was good to hear your voice.
I'm really sorry about before, but I tried to...
No, no, no. You're right.
I was a complete asshole.
We will get back to that, but you still get downloads at home?
- Stock stuff?
- Yeah, but...
Planecorp Industries.
Check it out for me, will ya?
Slow modem. Still waiting.
When are you coming home, Zane?
I'm not exactly...
- Who said I was gone?
- I stopped by yesterday.
The papers were stacking up so I put them inside.
Here we go. Ticker P.L.C.,
Planecorp Industries.
A leader in clean air technology.
Blah, blah, blah.
They buy up old power utilities, overhaul and put them back on line.
Ecuador, Peru, three facilities in Mexico.
Wait a minute. Back up.
There's more than one plant?
As of January 1, they have eight facilities on line... and 12 more planned, all in third-world countries.
Twenty plants?
Where's all the money coming from?
American investors.
Your mutual funds at work.
Wow.
Well, thanks for the help, Char.
Wh... What? That's it?
After four weeks, you call me up for a stock report? l... I don't know what else to say.
How about "I miss you"?
I shouldn't have to say it.
If that's it... how big does that make the...
Oh, my God.
I'm sorry.
Do you want to see the ruins, my friend?
Mr. Zaminsky, we caught you speeding on the wrong side of the road.
Mr. Zaminsky, we caught you speeding on the wrong side of the road.
Then you said you were in the cantina last night... with Senorita what's-her-name?
Green. Ilana Green.
I suppose you were drinking.
We had a couple of beers.
That has nothing to do...
This week is El Dia de los Muertos, the Day of the Dead.
So what?
As an American, you're not familiar with these costumes... with all these things we see all around.
Wrong.
What I saw was no costume... was no paper mache skeleton.
It was nothing like that.
The captain of security for the power station has called... to report an accident.
That a man, intoxicated... killed someone with his car last night.
An American man.
No, that is not what happened.
- That is to say you were involved.
- They are lying!
It's up to me to decide who's lying.
That's why I make the questions, and you give me answers.
Now, again, were you involved in this?
I hit something... with the car.
Now, who it was or what it was,
I'm not sure.
But if they're saying I killed someone, I want to see it.
Bring the body.
I demand to see it!
There's no need to demand that,
Mr. Zaminsky.
That's exactly what they're doing.
Don't go anywhere.
Our word for an attorney is abogado.
I suggest you...
Mercury peaks around 99 degrees today.
Yes, that will be a record for this day in October.
But nowhere is it hotter right now than in the hallways of NASA... where officials are still trying to explain... what happened yesterday to that atmospheric satellite... that blew up just 32 seconds after launch.
Press conference now underway at J.P.L. in Pasadena.
Anybody gonna lose their job over this?
I'm really not the right p...
You don't look too good.
Actually, I look like a can of smashed assholes.
Here's a tip.
If you ever get the chance to travel with a Mexican rodeo... pass.
Look, Zane, about before, I'm sorry.
D.O.D. was putting pressure on me to keep a lid on things.
Then you start asking questions in front of all those people.
No, no. Forget it.
No hard feelings.
I just wanted to drop by and pay you a visit... check up on my old buddy Gordy... maybe see what's really what... who's really who.
I tell you, Zane, you're really not making very much sense.
We should walk over to the infirmary.
It didn't make a lot of sense to me either... the first time I saw your face on another guy.
Genetic dice?
No, I don't think so.
I think somebody just screwed up.
As good as you are, you do make mistakes, don't you?
They should have broke the mold, Gordy.
- What do you want?
- What do I want?
I wanna blow a hole in your head and donate your organs to science.
But there are a few things
I need to know first.
Fuckin' N.R.A.
It's just so easy to get one.
Let's have a chat.
Yeah. Okay.
Media Center. Looks like somebody stole some camera gear.
- You want it?
- A real crime.
Somebody's on the way.
So who was targeted?
Anyone in SETI?
Well, not anyone.
Who then?
Look in the mirror.
Prime intellect.
Nonconformist reasoning.
Capacity for lateral thinking.
- Isn't that what you see?
- And then what?
A control is assigned?
Somebody like you?
Could I actually see this gun of yours, Zane?
Oh, sure. But if I pull it out, it'll be the last thing you ever see.
Well, I think it's possible to say... that you've been watched for quite a while now.
So which programs besides SETI? NASA?
Ask yourself why an antenna won't deploy on a deep-space probe.
Or ask how they could launch a $6 billion telescope... without testing its mirror.
- What you're actually saying...
- I'm saying nothing.
I'm just listening to you ask questions.
Then I'll ask about Planecorp.
Planecorp.
Sorry, I don't know what that is.
You know, it's that factory down in Mexico.
It's outside my knowledge.
One of 20 being built in third-world countries.
- Outside.
- Where no laws protect the air.
- Outside my knowledge.
- You build where it's hot.
You like it hot, Gordy, don't you?
Zane, if you force me to answer you... what you will be hearing is your own death sentence.
Now, as much as you think you know, you don't know the half of it.
Right now, you're just one little guy with a big conspiracy theory... and no proof, and the world is full of them.
So, Zane, you take great care... in what else you choose to learn.
They're terraform factories?
- Yes.
- You're pumping out greenhouse gas.
- Now you're dead.
- You're changing the air... the temperature, the whole ecosystem.
We're just finishing what you started.
What would've taken you 100 years we'll do in 10.
Just speeding along your own demise.
Like you sped Calvin along, and Ilana Green, right?
If you can't tend to your own planet... none of you deserve to live here.
Bang. You're dead.
Don't tell me that's who I think it is.
We have a problem here?
No. No problem.
I'm gonna handle this myself.
Geez!
Zane, what are you doing out here?
You scared the living...
Who's been here? Anyone?
- Anybody been watching my house?
- Nobody I seen.
I can't believe they wouldn't be.
I'm gonna say something that's gonna sound completely insane.
I'm telling you because I think you might actually believe me.
I'm also telling you because
I can't be the only one who knows... in case they find me...
- before I finish this.
- Tell me.
I followed the signal to Mexico because we thought somebody was...
Yeah, yeah.
They weren't "us," Kiki.
So what was they?
Do they got these little flashlight fingers that...
Maybe they got these big metal teeth that come out and sort of...
What does they look like then?
Like you. Like me. Like anyone.
- What they doing here?
- I'll show you.
I'll show everyone, as soon as I fire up the array.
Shit!
You've been evicted.
I gotta get out to Oro Valley, out to the big dish.
Hold this. Don't drop it.
What game does it play?
Where's the start button?
- You going to let me in?
- Who's Char?
I can't stay. If they're not here now, they will be soon.
Who? The police?
What about the police?
They came to my work, some detective.
He said something about manslaughter charges in Mexico.
You're a fugitive?
Ooh, that's phat.
The whole thing was fabricated.
They set me up.
I don't understand.
Why would the police want to...
Not the police.
It was them.
Them. Who's them?
- Forget it.
- Probably the aliens.
Who is this child?
And I hope he means illegal aliens.
I'll take your car.
Give me that.
No, you won't.
Not until I know what is going on here.
Look, it sounds nuts, but I know what I saw.
I know why they're here. I know about the poppy field in the Arctic.
Their whole master plan about the air and the...
Give me the keys.
I can't let you go, Zane.
Not alone, not like this.
You don't have to come. I wouldn't believe it unless I'd seen it myself.
But, Char, I must leave now.
If you think I'm letting you out of my sight, you are nuts.
Can I come?
Get off me!
This isn't a field trip.
I left my grandma a note.
I want to help.
Drive!
Pull over at the on-ramp.
I'll drive.
I've got shotgun.
Zane, I think that you've got to deal with this somehow.
If it means both of us going to the police and explain...
I can't get stuck in some jail.
Not now.
Please, pull over.
We're here. Now, what do you hope to accomplish?
Keys. Keys.
Where's Char?
What are you doing?
Getting my stuff out of the car.
That all right?
I just... The strangest thoughts.
Kiki, if it says "power," you push it.
These monitors, this stuff here.
Light it up... everything.
Find OMNI Star 5.
I'll need two sets of coordinates.
Right ascension and declination.
I don't see how listening to some star...
It's not a star, and this time we're talking, not listening.
So this is some kind of satellite in orbit?
It's a co-op weather satellite... one that about 50 TV stations pull a continuous feed off of.
A hundred thousand watts ought to get their attention.
- They'll understand what this means?
- We're gonna find out... right now.
Shit.
What's happening?
What is wrong with this thing?
Gardening. I didn't see any gardens around here.
What are they doing here, Char?
Like I should know.
You made a call... from the car.
When you start talking about aliens and master plans... and this woman being killed in Mexico...
Did I mention that it was a woman?
The police told me, okay?
Ah. And that's who you called, right, Char?
- You called the police.
- Yes, it is.
You were scaring me with your talk.
You're scaring me now.
As soon as I left SETI, you left.
As soon as I got back from Mexico, there you were, waiting for me.
Because I thought you might need me, Zane.
Like I needed all that career advice?
The gentle persuasion... the little nudges about how
I was wasting my life!
Cold. Too cold.
I'm sorry.
I am just so sorry.
I didn't believe about...
You've got to trust me when I say that I only called the police...
- and only because I wanted...
- Then what are they doing here?
Who told them to find me here?
I don't know.
I honestly do not know.
Watch this screen.
When you see my face, hit the red key right there next to you.
- The transmit key.
- You ain't leaving me here?
Don't worry.
They'll be chasing us.
We're going to give this one more shot.
Go.
No, it's this way. Go.
Give me the chain.
You can move the dish from here.
Go. I can do this.
For once in your paranoid life, please just trust me.
Now, Kiki.
Now, Kiki! Hit it now!
Kiki, the red transmit key.
Hit it now!
Kiki, for shit's sake, hit it now!
Now! Now!
Hit it now!
Like I said.
You didn't know the half of it.
Zane, what happened?
Why did they leave?
They didn't.
How do you know?
Because we aren't dead yet.
Help me.
Move!
Zane, can we get out of here now?
Not that way.
I'll be right behind you.
Not... so... fast.
Oh, please. Oh, please.
Please.
Why did it have to be like this?
Why couldn't you just come and ask for our help?
Then you tell them...
You go back and tell them... that I know, that she knows... that others will know!
It's not going to be easy.
Not anymore.
Summer is just refusing to go away.
Record highs again in the Big Apple... while New England states report a delay of the fall foliage season.
It's been warmer than normal up and down the Eastern seaboard.
They're terraform factories?
- Yes.
- You're pumping out greenhouse gas.
- Now you're dead.
- You're changing the air... the temperature, the whole ecosystem.
We're just finishing what you started.
What would've taken you 100 years we'll do in 10.

This is a really good show, man.
[ Woman ]
It's from the Gut Cutter's
Celebration Collection, makers of premier knives and edge ware.
The knife features a stainless steel blade, perfect for any use in hunting or in the home.
The pro handle is made from authentic antique plywood... and stained in brilliant colors for an uncanny charm.
Hey, man, that shit is not easy to come by!
Why don't you take a walk outside?
...to a cutting edge that will rip through anything—
[ Liquid Splashes ]
Great!
I'm so sorry.
[ Christie ]
Now I smell like this shit!

- Thankyou, General Perez.
Well?
You gonna kill me, orwhat?
There's no point, is there?
They've taken it out ofyou.
Where is it?
Is it on the ship?
You mean my baby.
I don't get it.
Ifthey took it out, why are they keeping you alive?
Well, they're curious.
I'm the latest thing.
Look.
I can make it all stop.
The pain, this nightmare.
That's all I can offeryou.
What makes you think...
I would let you do that?
Who are you?
Ripley, Ellen,
Lieutenant First Class, number 36706.
Ellen Ripley died
200 years ago.
You're not her.
I'm not her.
[ Sighs ]
Who am I?
You're a thing, a construct.
They grew you in a fucking lab.
And now they brought it out ofyou.
Not all the way out.
I can feel it... behind my eyes.
I can hear it moving.
You gotta help me stop this thing before it gets loose.
It's too late.
You can't stop it.
It's inevitable.
Not as long as I'm around.
You'll never get out of here alive.
I don't care.
Really?
[ Whispers ]
I can make it stop.
Go on. Get out of here.
They're looking foryou.
[ Weapon Cocks,
Whirring ]
I think you're gonna find that this was very ill-advised.
Where are her friends?
They're in the mess hall, sir.
Well, you find them, now.
Quietly.
What the hell is going on here?
Smells like a double-cross, boss.
Where's the other one?
With the chair?
Don't ever touch me.
Ever.
You wanna tell us what this is?
You wanna tell me who you're workin' for.
What?
- Wren, they got nothing to do with this.
- To do with what?
Do you know what the penalties for terrorist activity are?
No goddamn terrorists on my crew. Call, there something you wanna tell me?
Look. I don't care whether you knew or not. You brought a terrorist on board a military vessel.
And as far as I am concerned, you all die with her!
Do you understand?
Yeah.
I understand.
Christie.
[ Elgyn ]

[ Gunshot ]
Stop! Drop your weapons!
And you!
Drop that piece ofshit, or I blow his head off!
- Can't do that, man.
- Drop it now!
- Can't do that.
They're attached to me.
- I'm not fucking with you!
You're all under arrest for a code eight, which is concealed weapons, and a code 1 2, which is murder!
Release Dr. Wren!
Kiss my ass.
Put down yourweapons and assume the fucking—
[ Groans, Coughs ]
Everybody okay?
[ Soldier Coughs Over Monitor]
[Johner Over Monitor]
Real easy, soldier boy.
[ Man ]

There is a serious problem in the mess hall.
You lie to me now, little girl,
I will cut your throat and leave you here to die, you understand me?

What ifthere's more?
I say we stay here, man.
Let the army guys deal.
Where the fuck are the army guys?
They're dead!
Well, then we don't need this asshole anymore.
- Step back!
- No, you step back!
- Stop it!
- You got no authority here!
[ Alarm Blaring, Faint ]
Doctor, that thing that killed my partner, that's your pet science project?
Yes.
- Let me do him right now, man!
- I should let him do you right now!
How many more are there?
How many more are there?
Twelve.
- [Johner]
Twelve?
- Twelve.
Twelve.
There'll be more.
So, who do I have to fuck to get offthis boat?
I can get you off.
Maybe not the boat, but-
Let's get out of here.
No, wait a second here.
She was the host for these monsters.
Wren cloned her because she had one inside her.
She's not human.
She was part of his experiment, and she will turn on us in a second.
[ Christie ]
I don't give a shit what she is.
[ Call ]
She's too much ofa risk.
We have to leave her.
- She comes.
- We can't trust her!
I don't trust anyone.
Ifwe're gonna survive this mess, we all stick together.
Agreed?
Hillard, we gotta go.
It's not over.
We gotta get to the Betty.
[ Grunts ]
Make a nice souvenir.
I can't believe you did that.
Did what?
Killed one of'em.
It's like killing your own kind.
It was in my way.
[ Beeps ]
[ Christie Exhales ]
Oh, man!
Who were you expecting, Santa Claus?
- [ Sighs ]
- Thought you were toast for certain, man.
Shit. Where's Elgyn?
Oh, shit.
Hey, man, what if we get to the Betty and they're all over it?
- All the activity's been in the aft sector by the barracks. Why would they move?
- [ Ripley ] They won't.
Ifthey send anyone out, it'll be, uh, here, where the meat is.
Yeah. Well, I say ifwe wanna make any decent time,
I say we ditch the cripple.
- No offense, man.
- None taken.
Nobody is left behind.
Not even you,Johner.
- What's the quickest way out of here?
- After the cooling tower, there's a freight elevator.
It runs from the top ofthe ship down to
Engineering Level 1 deck.
- Take us straight to the dock.
- Sounds reasonable. Let's do it.
We're moving.
- What?
- [ Ripley ]
The ship is moving.
I can feel it.
The ship has stealth run.
There's no wayyou can tell.
She's right.
The ship's been go since the attack.
That's a standard emergency procedure.
That's right.
Any serious problem, and the ship autopilots back to home base.
And you were planning on letting us know this?
Nobody asked.
- [ Scoffs ]
- What's home base?
Earth.
Oh, great.
- Bastard.
- [Johner]
Earth?
I'd rather stay here with the things, man.
How long until we get to Earth?
Three hours almost.
We gotta blow the ship.
Call, you're not blowing this ship.
Not while we're on it, okay?
We get out ofthis shit, you do as you please, all right?
Earth, man.
What a shit-hole.
[ Ripley ]
It's clear.
Hey, Ripley.
I heard you, like, ran into these things before.
That's right.
Wow, man.
So, like, what did you do?
I died.

Who are you people?
What's happening here?
[ Christie ]
Calm down.
What's happening here is we're getting the fuck off this ghost ship, okay?
Ship? What ship?
Where am I?
I was in cryo, right?
On my way to Xarem, right?
Work crew for the nickel refinery, right?
I wake up.
I know I don't understand.
Oh, God. Uh, I s- I saw—
I saw horrible things.
Look, you're coming with us.
It's too dangerous foryou here.
[ Breathing Erratically ]
[ Sniffing ]
Leave him.
Fuckyou.
We're not leaving him here.
He's got one inside of him.
I can smell it.
[ Man ]
Inside me?
Inside me?
What's inside me?
[Johner] Hey, man.
I don't want one ofthose things birthing anywhere near my ass.
It's a bad risk.
- What's inside me?
- Look, we can'tjust leave him here.
- I thought you came here to stop 'em from spreadin'.
- What's inside me?
- There's gotta be a process.
Can't you stop it?
- [ Christie ] Got no time for that.
- I can't do it here.
The lab is out oforder.
- What's inside me?
I could do him.
Back ofthe head.
Painless.
It might be the best way.
- What's inside me?
- No, there's got to be another way.
[ Call ]
What ifwe freeze him?
What's in-fuckin'-side me?
A parasite!
Foreign element.
There's a monster in your chest.
These guys hijacked your ship, and they sold your cryo tube... to this... human, and he put an alien inside ofyou.
It's a really nasty one.
And in a few hours, it's gonna burst its way through your rib cage... and you're gonna die.
Any questions?
[ Breathing Erratically ]
Who are you?
I'm the monster's mother.
[ Call ]
Look, he comes with us, we freeze him on the Betty,
- then the doctor can remove it later.
- Fine with me.
Since when were you in goddamn charge?
- Since you were born without balls!
- Ease off, people.
All right.
You come with us.
You might even live.
[ Christie ]
Get twitchy on me, and you'll be shot.
Let's move out.
[Johner ]
It's a mess down there!
Is this the only way?
Vriess, we gotta lose the chair.
I know.
Kawlang maneuver, all right?
Yeah,just like old times.
Yeah.
Must be the cooling tanks.
Somebody must have opened the valves.
The nasties couldn't have done this, could they?
We're at the bottom ofthe ship.
We have to go through the kitchen, maybe 90 feet, to the freight elevator on the other side.
- I don't like it.
- What's to like?
This sucks!
- Wren, are you sure about the distance?
- Yes.
- You ready to get wet, partner?
- Yeah.
[ Coughs ]
Hey, uh, do your weapons fire underwater?
- Yeah, they're disposables.
They can take it.
- Disposables?
[ Laughing ]
Hey, I heard about those. Yeah.
- How many rounds?
- Twenty.
Split points give you a good hole, even at the smaller caliber.
Oh. Hey, that's cool.
[ Laughing ]
Yeah. They're big with hitters
'cause you, uh, throw 'em away after thejob.
Nobody likes to throw away a weapon they're attached to.
You know what I mean?
Yeah.
Guess I don't have to tell everyone to take a deep breath.

You're a robot?

- You're a second gen, aren't you?
You're an Auton.
Robots designed by robots, right?
Hah!
Oh, yeah. That's right.
I remember.
Now, they were supposed to revitalize the synthetic industry.
Instead, they buried it.
[ Chuckles ]
They didn't like being told what to do.
Government ordered a recall.
Now, I heard—
I had— I had heard... that only a few- just a few- had gotten out intact.
Man, I never, never thought that I would see one!
Great. She's a toaster oven.
Can we leave now?
- [ Distephano Laughing ]
- [ Ripley ]
How long before we land?
[ Distephano ]

[Johner] Hey, Vriess.
You got a socket wrench?
Maybe shejust needs an oil change.

I'm sorry. Access denied.
I can't believe I almost fucked it.
Yeah, like you never fucked a robot!
[ Ripley ]
You know, ifWren gets in the computer, he could really screw us.
[Johner] We gotta find a terminal.
No, there's no console on this level.
We'd have to go back.
Well, we can't go back.
- And I don't know any ofWren's access codes.
- Help me.
Call.
No. I can't.
Right. You're the new model droid.
You can access the mainframe by remote.
No, I can't.
I burned my modem.
We all did.
Call, you can still patch in manually.
You know that.
[ Distephano ]
There's ports in the chapel, up there.
Call.
You're programmed for that?
Don't make me do this.
Don't make me make you.
[ Sighs ]
I don't want to go in there.
It's like my insides are liquid.
It's not real.
Get over it.
You can blow the ship before it reaches Earth... and kill them all.

I'm finding a lot ofthings funny lately, but I don't think they are.
Why do you go on living?
How can you stand being what you are?
Not much choice.
At least there's a part ofyou that's human.
[ Sighs ]
I'm just— Look at me.
I'm disgusting.
Why did you come here?
To kill you, remember?
Before the recall,
I accessed the mainframe.
Every dirty little covert op the government ever dreamed of is in there.
And this-you, the aliens, even the crew from the Betty-
I knew ifthey succeeded, it would be the end ofthem.
Why do you care what happens to them?
Because I'm programmed to.
You're programmed to be an asshole?
You're the new asshole model they're putting out?
Come on.
I couldn't watch 'em do it.
I couldn't let 'em annihilate themselves.
Do you understand that?
I did once.
I tried to save... people.
It didn't work out.
There was this girl.
She had bad dreams.
I tried to help her.
She died.
Now I can't even remember her name.
I guess we're almost there.
[ Ripley ]
Right.
[ Ripley Sighs ]
Do you dream?
[ Call ]
I— Well, we have neuroprocessors that- Yes.
[ Ripley ]
When I sleep,
I dream about them— it.
Every night.
All around me, in me.
I used to be afraid to dream, but I'm not anymore.
Why?
[ Ripley Chuckles ]
Because no matter how bad the dreams get, when I wake up, it's always worse.
- [ Distephano ]
It's not so far now!
- God, I'm so tired.
[Johner ]
Sleep when you die, man.
Oh, no. This is bad, right?
- I think we're near the nest.
- Well, then we'll go another way.
We don't have time.
We got nearly 90 minutes.
- Not anymore.
- What are you saying?
- What did you do, robot?
- Let's go. Come on.
Hey! You want to die here with your little brothers and sisters, that's cool!
But I plan to live past today!
Ifthis little hunk of plastic is pulling any shit,
I'm gonna kill her!
Kill you!
Does that compute?
Or do I have to drawyou a schematic?
[ Gagging ]
Hey!
- You want another souvenir?
- [ Gagging Continues ]
- How far are the docks?
- A h-hundred yards.

Ripley, we have to go.
I hear them.
I hear them.
They're so close.

It's the queen.
She's in pain.
- [ Screams ]
- Ripley!
Ripley!
Wait!
Oh, my God.
[ Man ]
We gotta be moving.
The best thing you can do is pray for a quick death.
Come on. Come on.
It's not right.
[ Man ]
I've been saying that all day.
[ Vriess ]
It's up to you now, Call.
I need you to patch into the ship again and open the hatch.
[ Computer Beeping ]
[ Beeps ]
Johner, we should put Purvis in the freezer now.
[Johner ]
All right, little buddy.
Nap time.
[ Screams ]
- Oh!
- [ Call Whimpering ]
Nobody moves, or I put a cap... right where this little droid's brain is.
Distephano, take the weapons.
Begging your pardon, sir, but fuckyou!
Oh, fine. Then I kill her, and you kill me, and we all die, and nobody goes home!
Now drop the weapon.
Then this little synthetic bitch... is gonna plug into the Auriga, and she is gonna take us right back to home base, according to the standard emergency procedures.
- No, she's not.
- [ Distephano ]
Are you crazy?
You still want to bring those things back to Earth?
- Haven't you been paying any attention today?
- Ah, the intellectual speaks.
Stay there!

At first, everything was normal.
The queen laid her eggs.
But then she started to change.
She added a second cycle cell.
So, this time there is no host.
There are no eggs.
There is only herwomb... and the creature inside.
That is Ripley's gift to her: a human reproductive system.
She is giving birth foryou, Ripley, and now she is perfect!

Yeah, I get that a lot.

- For Christ's sake.
- [Johner]
Hey, Ripley.
Good memory. Excuse me.
Ripley's back, man.
Is that it?
Nope.
You can't fly one of these things too, can you?
Are you kidding?
This piece ofshit is even older than I am.

This is Earth.
This is my first time here.
I suppose the military will be sniffing around here pretty soon.
[ Sniffs ]
Bet you're not too anxious to see them.
Not really.
You know, a person could get pretty lost around here ifthey wanted to.
What do you think?
What should we do?
I don't know.
I'm a stranger here myself.
English - US - PSDH
Listen up, 'cause
I'm only tellin' you this once.
I'm not a bedtime story lady, so pay attention.
It's 2033.
The world is screwed now.
You see, a while ago, this humongous comet came crashing into the Earth.
Bam!
Total devastation.
End of the world as we know it.
No celebrities, no cable TV, no water.
It hasn't rained in 11 years.
Now, 20 people gotta squeeze inside the same bathtub.
So, it ain't all bad.
That's me... the one in the mask.
No, the other one in the mask.
Today's my boyfriend's birthday.
So, I'm out shopping for that perfect gift... whatever I can scrounge up.
Uh-oh, Ripper leftovers.
The Rippers are a demonic army of bloodthirsty, human eating, purse snatching, mutant creatures.
Witness exhibit A.
Uchh!, you are so dead.
They're led by the infamous
Johnny Prophet.
They spend most of their time raidin' the WP.
That's short for Water and Power.
They control most of the water and got all the power.
Oh, wait, one last thing.
My friends and me, we do not suck up to Water and Power.
Yeah, we steal water, but as long as they don't find out, who gives a shit?
Ah, there it is... home sweet home.
A thing of beauty.
I'm gonna go water the vegetables.
Hey, Town, you fixed the pump, right?
I'm going down.
Yeah, go for it.
Shit.
You've been stealing water.
What gave you that idea?
Take off your clothes.
Ohh, agh!
- Now!
- Shit.
Right, right, right, right...
There.
Did I tell you to stop?
Ohh.
Now...
Salute me.
I'm not too good under pressure.
Well, you'll learn then, won't you?
Gross out.
Come on, they're being weird again.
Let's get outta here.
Let go.
Damn!
Hah, I was just gettin' into that one.
Give me that.
Hey, Sam.
I thought you was working on my Doris Day bust.
I didn't trade you my specially autographed Doris picture just for whatever this is.
I know, but the wood talks to me.
It said, "Ripper. "
How would you know what one looks like?
No one's ever seen a Ripper.
No one's ever seen your peanut dick either.
- I'm tellin'.
- Go ahead.
Rebecca, don't forget guard duty.
Ah.
Adam was dust until God injected him with life.
And do you know what was in that injection?
Water.
Water is life.
Water is power.
Well done.
You've all done a masterful job.
Ninety-five percent of the desert and all the water it contains now belongs to Water and Power.
Well, I think that deserves a little toast.
To Captain Derouche for securing most of the desert.
Captain Derouche.
Captain Derouche.
I can promise you, sir, the Rippers will only be a minor setback.
Hmm.
Once I take care of them, that final crack of land will be ours.
This crack of land, Captain?
Hm, hm, well, just a small crack.
Doesn't matter, we'll let that go.
Hmm.
Oh, my.
Now look what's happened.
We lost the Feta Plains.
And the Tenelson Ridge.
And so on!
There are three million liters of water underneath the Blue Dunes.
And you will retrieve it.
Do I make myself clear, gentlemen?
Yes, sir.
Good!
Remove your boots, Captain.
Now, come here.
The fool.
It was foolish not to carry out my order.
And it was foolish to walk across a floor full of glass.
If I were you,
I wouldn't have done it.
I would have killed me first.
But you lack that courage, don't you, Captain?
Come closer.
Well.
Uh!
Ah.
Sergeant Small, it's your show now.
Please, try not to let me down.
Yes, sir.
Lovely.
I take guard duty very seriously.
Elvis, Elvis, come out and play.
Hey, baby, what do you say, me and you, Vegas?
Bollocks!
Boo!
Rebecca?
Rebecca?
Rebecca?
Rebecca?
Rebecca!
Ha ha, got you.
You butt smear.
What'd I tell you?
Don't say butt smear.
It's not becoming.
Say... asshole.
Or dickwad.
- Trade you.
- What?
I'll sneak you some food for that danger ball you found.
I don't know.
You know how to work it?
- Mm-hm.
- If you don't... you're steak tartare.
All right.
First, go get me my food.
Happy birthday.
I knew you couldn't resist me.
Snip snip.
Don't come any closer.
You gotta stay there.
And watch.
Okay, you can come a little bit closer.
But you can't touch.
Hi.
Lose the scissors.
Shit.
Water and Power, hands in the air!
Over here, over here!
It's the troopers.
Confirmed, they've been siphoning water.
Well, keep going.
We're just gettin' to the good stuff.
Ooh, yeah.
Okay.
Uh!
- Drop something?
- Huh?
Ha ha.
Aww, shit.
Rebecca, help!
Rebecca!
- Sam!
- Rebecca!
No!
Richard!
Come on!
Shit!
We got her!
You've been stealing water.
- Not smart.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
We could have a lot of fun with this one.
Well, well.
Don't you know you shouldn't own animals?
There's a water shortage.
There's your water.
Uh!
Hey, you.
Look at me when
I'm talkin' to ya.
That cut looks painful.
I like pain.
And what else do you like?
Hot oil.
Vacuum attachments.
Yeah?
Yep.
Hey, which of you gorgeous guys would like an oil change, hm?
Don't be stupid, she's gonna bite it off.
The moment I feel teeth, you feel lead.
Well, what are you waiting for?
I'm gonna need a microscope and tweezers.
It's like, uh...
You know, you're gonna have to stop this.
You're really gettin' me hot.
Freeze!
What?
Ah, ah.
She's all yours, sir.
Just how many of my men did you kill?
Mm-mm.
Eight, sir.
Eight, eight, the burning eight.
Between Sunday and Monday hangs a day so dark, it will devastate.
Excuse me.
Hey.
Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.
Look, you want to torture me, spank me, lick me?
Do it.
But if this poetry shit continues, just shoot me now please?
What, and waste all that talent?
I'm offering you the chance of a lifetime.
The honor of working for me.
Not interested.
Not yet.
Put her to work.
Dig or die!
You people are pathetic!
Come on, get back to work!
These water pipes should have been dug yesterday!
Hey, just stand still.
Hey, this scum's got a knife.
Enjoying yourself?
Uh!
Hey, what time is it?
I don't want to miss Bay Watch.
Hey, Jess, how's the jet, Jet?
I asked you a question!
There are stress cracks in the main engine turbine blades.
And the manifold pressure sensor's leaking like a sieve.
I'm doing a full teardown.
I'll have her back together by Wednesday.
You'll have her back together by morning.
I don't care if you have to work all night.
That is, of course, unless you want to make me change my mind.
Uh!
I'll have it fixed by morning.
Failure to recycle body fluids is a violation.
Number four...
Hoarding water rations is a violation.
Number five... syphoning body fluids from another prisoner is a violation.
Number six... Tampering with no smoking devices is a violation.
What is your problem?
I have gone out of my way to be nice to you!
If it wasn't for me, you would just be another whore around here.
Now, all I'm askin' for is just a little bit in return.
Quit pickin' on my girlfriend.
Uh.
Shit.
Uh, God, that is...
Thanks.
It worked.
What worked?
Mm, oh, my God.
End of shift.
All prisoners return to cells.
End of shift.
All prisoners return to cells.
Ahh!
Heh, heh, heh.
I'm in love.
Ba-ba-ba-bam.
Cool.
Systems check, stand by.
Check, check, check, check, check.
Please enter security signature.
My mom and your mom were hangin' out clothes.
- Security signature invalid.
- Shit.
You have ten seconds before cyanide gas is injected into the chamber.
- Go, go!
- Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.
Oh, no.
You know the security code to this thing?
Yeah, yeah.
Good, then get me outta here.
Go, do it.
Get to cranking.
They're hijacking a tank.
Sir, if you want my opinion...
No, I don't.
Places to wreck, people to do.
This tank, it isn't... isn't, isn't...
- isn't...
- What?
Come on, just one little adjective, we'll have a whole sentence here.
The tank isn't...
Glad.
Sad.
Mad.
- Um...
- Lonely.
It isn't op... op... operational.
How do I know you're not lyin'?
Because, if I was lying, your lungs would be full of cyanide gas.
Cool, so we get a new tank.
Wait, wait.
Look, um, nobody gets out of here without a clearance.
We're all prisoners here.
And if... if they catch you...
Then they'll, don't tell me, they'll take away my TV privileges.
I'll live with it.
My, my.
She'll be fun to break.
How's your lover?
Huh?
Yeah, I wouldn't get too attached.
She's not going to be around much longer.
Well, I bet you just can't wait to take this baby for a test run, huh?
That's too bad.
'Cause you just lost your flying privileges.
And, uh, the whole hangar is off limits too.
You happy?
Miss me?
What... what are you doing?
Oh, I was just thinking about leaving this place.
It's been swell, but the swelling's gone down.
What do you reckon?
We go to New York, see Cats.
You... you don't understand.
The... the better you behave, the more they leave you alone.
And the more they leave you alone, the better off you are.
Well, that's a bore.
There's nuttin' to be scared of.
You just gotta think about it like the first time you got laid.
You just gotta go,
"Daddy, are you sure this is right?"
Oh, you're sick.
How come you always do that?
How come you always cover your mouth when you smile?
You got bad teeth or somethin'?
- Mm, I don't know.
- Come on.
What do you say we bolt?
Oh!
You know, I'm really startin' to like it here.
People are nice, food's great, and I love my job.
I can see why you want to hang around.
Morning.
It's really hard for me to play with myself in this thing.
That's a shame.
Look, you want to play,
I'll play.
And I'll win.
No, not if it's Monopoly,
'cause I really kick ass at that game.
But, I get to be the shoe.
I'm going to ask you just one more time.
Do you want to work for Water and Power?
Oh, yeah, that sounds groovy.
I get to wear a cute little outfit like yours?
The pipe.
You're gonna really love this one.
Goes down 40 meters.
You'll get smaller and smaller the deeper you go.
Sounds wicked.
Can I go first?
I hope you're not claustrophobic.
Drop her.
Uh!
Bye.
No!
No!
Don't go.
Help!
Rebecca!
Full metal.
They didn't even have a chance to squeeze off a round.
Another outpost lost to those Rippers.
At this rate, we'll lose all our water.
Rippers must have come up from some underground sub gate.
Well then, I know just the young lady to help us find it.
Absolutely, sir.
Uhh.
Hmm, well, I'm so glad you see things my way now.
You know what I see?
No.
What?
This big honkin' booger hangin' outta your left nostril.
If I was you,
I'd use this finger to pick it out.
Uhh.
I win.
Yeah.
Lucky you.
And just wait till you see what you've won.
- Excuse me.
- Ow!
Relax, it's only a locator.
This is your pulse.
Now I'll always be close to your heart.
Your job is to penetrate this sub gate we found, which could be the entrance to the Ripper's base.
Most of these are booby-trapped, so if we hear a loud bang...
Sorry.
If not, congratulations, you just found the Ripper's hideout.
Either way, I win.
Like a piece of cheese at the end of a fishing hook.
That's you.
Ready.
- Move.
- Uh!
Rippers!
Arrgh!
Condor Control, Condor zero five,
I'm detecting Ripper activity.
Wha?
Oh, my God.
That's what you get for messin' with me.
Mine.
Well, what do you know?
Am I close to your heart now,
Kesslee?
What happened to the rest of you?
Butthead.
Cool.
Shit.
Don't shoot, don't shoot!
I thought the Rippers got you.
Hell, no.
Come on, let's go.
I ain't goin' back there.
Your gonna have to kill me first.
No, I'm not.
'Cause I'm not gonna go back there either.
We're free.
Oh, no.
We better go before they come back for us.
You take the tank.
Are you sure?
Go, go, all right.
Rebecca!
Don't leave.
No! Rebecca, come on!
Rebecca, turn the engine off!
Kill the engine!
You're crazy!
Are you okay?
Sorry about the bonker on the head.
I think I need to go practice some more.
- No!
- Yes. Take that!
- No, no!
- Yes.
- Heeya!
You didn't have to rough me up so bad, Becky.
Hmm.
Look, no hands.
You could do that for a living.
Look out!
You're face has been gutted,
Mr. Kesslee, sir.
To be honest, your chances of seeing again are as likely as your arm growing back.
However,
I can make you comfortable.
No!
No pain killers.
Do I make myself clear, Doctor?
Yes, sir.
Good.
Now, what is the prognosis?
Not good, sir.
Not good.
Excuse me.
- Sir, this is Mr. Che'tsai.
- What? What?
He... uh, Che'tsai.
He, uh, specializes in cybergenic reconstructive surgery.
- Oh.
- Go ahead.
All the king's horses and all the king's men wish they had the technology I have.
If you want my services... the fee will be 100,000 liters.
Doctor, come here.
You see the glass half empty.
I prefer to see it half full.
- Don't you agree, Sergeant?
- I don't understand.
Uh!
We can't be in here.
We're trespassing.
What if somebody catches us?
Jet, there she blow, matey.
Do- do-do, do-do-do.
Put it down, it's not funny.
What is it?
Raise your hands to the sky gods.
The rains are coming.
But it hasn't rained since the comet.
I need metal to complete my ark.
I'll be taking your tank.
No, see, you won't be taking the tank.
The Rippers are waiting.
I must save them from the floods.
Tell me the security code.
Bam!
- Ha ha.
- Oh!
All right, listen, rain lady, where'd you get this?
I made it.
- Liar.
- She's lying.
How do you know?
Well, it's a little something
I designed.
It's a spectrum analyzer which recognizes voice pattern stress modulations.
It detects lies.
But I only speak the truth.
Liar.
All right, all right, I, uh, I caught it in my fish pond on a stick.
Liar.
All right, all right, all right, all right.
They were selling a girl's stuff after they had taken her prisoner.
I bought it.
It was sad, really.
What'd they do with the girl?
First, tell me what Water and Power want with her.
We're not Water and Power.
We're escaped prisoners.
Oh, in that case.
Oh, it was terrible.
They put her to work in town at Liquid Silver.
Come on, Jet, we gotta go get her.
To the bat tank.
Wait, wait, we can't go into town with those Water and Power vehicles.
Oh, oh, oh, you can fix them up here in my garage.
Ha ha.
Da- da-da-da-da...
Pow!
Yes.
Ba-ba-ba-pow!
Hey, Jet.
Nice work.
They took the bait, sir, and they're on their way to Liquid Silver for the girl.
Make sure I get the girl first,
Sergeant.
Yes, sir.
I'm outta here.
What you got there, little boy?
No, I don't need none of that today, thank you.
Nice hats.
Rebecca, do you know what kind of place this is?
Yeah, come on, let's split up and find Sam.
Hi, how many would you like?
I got a guy here who wants the school girl thing.
For real.
Introduce him to Sam.
She's just a girl.
Not for long.
Dancers, welcome to Liquid Silver.
I could get you out.
First, we are going to create your look.
Girls, please step up to the glamour port in front of you.
Your dressing room is equipped with the latest Liquid Silver fashions.
We will start by shaving all inappropriate hair.
If your ears are not pierced, you'll find an ear puncher before you.
The crop top.
The anklets and the mules.
The spiraling arm cuff.
And now, the wrap skirt.
You have now finished creating your look.
If you have followed instructions properly, you should appear as so.
Lock up your sons.
Now, you stop this childish behavior this instant.
Do you want me to tell your mother how naughty you've been?
Do you?
Don't take my silver, it's all the money I've got.
Silver, I'll have that.
Uhh.
The clapper.
That's what you get for being a perv.
Hey, you're gonna get fired if you keep treatin' the guests like that.
Rebecca!
There she is!
- Uh-oh.
- And the little girl!
- Sam, come on.
- Get them!
- Hey!
- Guards!
Hurry!
Kill her.
Kill them both.
Not a good idea.
Now, everybody drop your guns, or I scrape off all her makeup.
This might take me a really long time.
Ha ha.
Sam, is this the lady that put you in a room with that scumbag?
Yeah.
A ten-year-old girl.
She has to learn sometime.
Look, you got two choices...
Either I improve that lovely hairdo...
Ooh! or you sing for us.
Ooh!
Fine.
All right, what do you want me to sing?
"Let's do it. "
Cole Porter, 1928.
Ooh!
I hate that song.
I'll cut it off.
Louder!
I can't hear you.
Everybody.
Come on, you too!
What the hell is that?
Sounds like Cole Porter to me, sir.
End it!
Yes, sir.
Move, come on, let's go, let's go now!
Sam!
Jet, Jet, Jet, where's Sam?
- Sam!
- Sam!
Sam!
Rebecca!
Let go!
Rebecca!
Sam!
Sam!
You let her go!
- Sam!
- Sam, Sam!
Help!
Sam!
Don't worry, your friends'll be along shortly to save you, my little princess.
The Rippers?
Are you kidding?
You don't know what they're like.
Are you out of your mind?
Listen to me, you haven't seen these things.
They're not human.
They're demons from hell.
I'm telling you.
Look, if we're gonna rescue Sam, we're gonna need an army.
They're an army.
Yeah, but...
Rebecca, we've been combing the desert all night.
We'll never find the Ripper's sub gate.
Look, rain lady said the Ripper's sub gate was around here somewhere.
Near two rocks.
I can't believe we're doing this.
Rebecca?
Rebecca?
Rebecca, where are you?
What's going on?
Rebecca?
Rebecca!
Rebecca!
Ah!
Jet, what took you so long?
What?
Uh!
What?
See hell, go to hell.
Duhh.
Oh, my God, it's the elephant man.
Hey, Quasimodo guy, we're hungry in here!
How 'bout some food.
- Ah!
- Now, you've done it.
[coughing
We're dead.
So, like... what are your names?
- Give me the gas.
- And like, what are you doing here?
Is it true what they say about guys with big shoes?
- Ooh.
- Yeah.
He asked you a question.
Answer it!
Hey, I have two words for you.
Brush your teeth!
They're spies.
They got Water and Power logos all over 'em.
Yeah, I was thinkin' that, right?
But then, I was also thinkin' that if they are Water and Power,
No, no, no, don't you. why would they come here advertising it?
Check it out.
Tattoos.
Give me that.
I wonder where else they got 'em.
I don't think those are tattoos.
I mean, like, who would want some alphabet soup?
I'd rather have a dragon or some... somethin' more
Aquarian related, you dig?
They're prisoner stamps.
- Mine.
- Prisoner, my ass.
That's exactly what they want us to think.
Or better yet, that isn't what they want us to think.
That way, we'll think what they think we might think.
But actually...
- Booga.
- Huh?
Try not to speak.
How much did they pay you to spy on us?
Shut up!
You should go easy on the truth serum.
It might send 'em off.
Hey.
On second thought, that could be to our advantage.
That's good, I'm tired of asking them questions anyway.
- I say we kill 'em.
- I say we hump 'em.
I say we get crumpets and tea.
Tasty.
Crumpets and tea.
All in favor of crumpets and tea, say "aye. "
Aye.
Shut up! Ain't gonna be no crumpets and tea.
We're gonna take 'em outside right now and waste 'em.
I think they're nice.
I... I say we let 'em go.
Let 'em go? They're spies!
I'm gonna kill 'em myself.
- Wait.
- Whoa!
Now, I don't remember anybody puttin' you in charge, T-Saint.
Yeah, he's right.
We're a committee now.
We'll vote on it.
Dig, all in favor of killin' 'em, raise your tail.
And all those in favor of not killin' 'em...
- Gentlemen, it's a tie.
- Coin toss time.
This is pathetic.
Hey, no cheating.
Ready, one, two...
I've got you.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Do you suppose me and Jet could go to the bathroom?
Uh, it's totally negatory.
- Hi.
- Hi.
You know, me and Jet can make it worth your while.
Put a little smile on that kangaroo face.
You got baseball cards?
Oh, but... no.
But, um, I... I know where
I could get you some.
She does.
It's totally negatory.
No, wait, wait, wait, uh, uh... come on.
Now, you don't want to be like those other manimals in there.
We're not manimals.
What are you?
The army wanted to build the ultimate soldier, so they messed with, uh, kangaroo NDA and...
You mean DNA.
Yeah.
And they created us.
And then the war ended and they told Johnny to poison us.
Johnny Prophet?
Yeah.
Why?
Because he was the one that made us.
But then he didn't do it because he decided that he liked us too much.
I have this great idea.
You, me, and Jet go for a visit with Johnny Prophet.
Well, when he get's back, yeah.
Uh, well, maybe.
Where did he go?
To, uh, uh, New Zealand for a little while to, uh, help some scientist guy who's makin' sea water so you could drink it.
Does she need to know that?
Did they need to know that?
- Uh, I was just...
- Get your ass outta here!
Uh!
Go ahead WP-2.
Hey, you guys, hey!
We have a shipment coming tonight from Red Sands, over.
Water and Power's gettin' some kind of shipment in.
What kind of shipment?
I don't know, all I know it's coming in from Red Sands.
- When?
- Tonight.
What if it's a arms shipment?
It's a trap.
What if they want us to think it's a trap, but it's really not?
That way, when we get there, it could still be one.
Or better yet, what if...
- Booga!
- Huh?
Why don't you make yourself useful and go and choke on something.
Oh, that's cold, man.
Okay, we're gonna give you chicks a chance to prove yourself.
Call it an initiation.
You fail, you die.
Yeah, but first you gotta strip.
That's not in the plan.
Why not?
Ha ha ha.
Hold on, cats.
All right.
All you have to do is confirm the shipment.
Copacetic?
You're gonna use this.
But you have to be really careful with it.
- Let me see.
- Because I designed it with a...
I, uh... I especially built it with a visual send processor.
It's a little invention that I invented myself, I might add.
Smile.
Oh, and these are so you can hear us.
This one's for you.
And this one I made especially for you.
- Hmm.
- Let me help you put it on because it's kind of tricky to...
Oh, I'm sorry, how clumsy of me.
- Ohh.
- What?
- Get off.
- It was hard to clip on.
Whaa...
Okay, so, we can hear you.
But how are you gonna hear us?
Just speak facin' West.
We'll hear you all right.
The code will be, "On the road. "
Yeah.
He's Jack Kerouac incarnated.
Uh, we... we're all reincarnated.
That means you're not really dead or you just think you're dead...
Who'd you used to be?
A cop.
Figures.
I used to be Ted Smith, assistant manager at Chief Auto Parts in Cincinnati, Ohio.
- Oh, fascinating.
- Oh, thank you.
I was a dog, but because
I was really good, they, uh, moved me up to human being status.
Uh, sort of.
Uh!
Strike.
North, wait...
South, West.
Mr. Kerouac,
I'm sending you an image.
Oh, he... here it comes.
This is the south side of the warehouse.
- Hey, hey, hey.
- That's gotta be it.
- Let's move!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
All I see is a couple of workers unloading some crates.
For all you know, that could be toilet paper.
I don't see no Water and Power vehicles out there.
Tell you the truth,
I don't see jack shit.
We need more proof.
Yeah, I'll give you more proof.
I've got your proof.
- Whoops, there it is.
- Oh, my.
Tasty.
Damn it.
We gotta get in closer if we're gonna take pictures of those weapons.
What are you doing?
Those guys'll mangle you.
Jet, they're men.
Move it or lose it.
- Whoop!
- Ooh!
- Becca.
- Mm, mm, mm, mm.
What's this for?
Work with me, girl.
What do you mean, work with you?
What are you doing?
Uh, fabulous.
I have died and gone to hard body heaven.
Shaniqua, don't dally.
You are giving me realness.
Delfrieda, darling, be a good little girl and let's get set up.
Over there by the crates.
Take off your shirt.
What are you doing here?
This is a restricted area.
I know you're not talking to me like this.
- Obviously, you didn't get the memo.
- What memo?
Darling, we are doing a men of Water and Power calendar.
- Oh.
- And I think you would be the perfect supermodel cover.
Oh.
You mean, we get to be calendar guys?
Can I be December?
Baby, you can be any month you want.
Yeah!
LeJeanne, have we left ourselves in our purse?
- Shoot the men near the crates.
- Uh!
It's more... manly.
Quickly.
Come on, get up, get up, come on.
- All right, here we go, okay.
- Oh, my goodness.
You are so beautiful, you're making me sick.
Smile for me.
Yes!
Yes.
What's this?
I don't know.
Let me see you... open your shirt.
Quick, quick, all right, now smile, let me see those teeth.
Come on, okay, yes, yes, yes, I like that.
Those are definitely weapons in those crates.
We better move.
No way, the whole thing is so convenient, man.
If they wanna be down with us, tell 'em to hijack the shipment themself.
If they pull it off, then we'll think about it.
Fine, I'll have the goods to you in an hour.
Asshole.
Oh!
The glamour has left the building.
There's no magic, there's no sparkle, there's no je ne sais quoi.
Come, Jetina.
Hold your chest, come on, brilliant, that's great.
Jetina, come.
Oh, God, that's great!
Yes, you're so brilliant, you're a supermodel...
The super has left the model, girl.
Come on.
So, when's the calendar comin' out?
Mmm, let's go!
Turbo boosters.
Ba-dah!
What the hell?
Suck on this, dirtbag!
And keep your ass out of the fast lane!
Damn!
Jet, what are you wearin' tonight?
Jetness, remember me?
Hijacking shipment, me, you.
Jet, hello.
Shit, I've got a malfunction.
Well fix it fast and get your narrow little butt over here.
I wouldn't want you to miss all this fun.
Do you mind?
I'm tryin' to have a little lunch.
Oh, now you're workin' my tits.
You guys can't shoot worth a shit.
- Uh!
- Ha, hey oh, ha, ha, ha!
Damn, where is she?
Road kill.
I'm too young for this shit.
Hey, I guess we got rid of her, huh?
Jack!
- Uh, uh!
- Hi.
Ha, ha.
Feeling a little inadequate?
- I'm out of here.
- Go!
Hey, girl, glad you could join me.
I'm in the semi and I got the goods.
Rebecca, can you hear me?
There's a big cliff coming up on you.
Now, hit the breaks.
Hit the brakes!
Oh, brakes aren't working girl, plan B.
Get out of there quick.
Jump!
Aw, shit!
Ah!
Rebecca!
Grab on.
I came as fast as I could.
I know you probably didn't need help.
But I got here as fast as I could.
I had it all under control, Booga.
That squash is really good.
A toast to our newest members.
May their energies enhance the spirit of our circle.
Yeah. Here, here.
Ahhh, great.
Now, let's check out the weapons.
After the ceremony, the weapons'll be disposed of.
Why?
After all that?
Uh, we don't use guns.
Uh-huh.
You don't use guns?
No, Prophet taught us to fight without the corruption of guns.
- Yeah.
- Let us all hold hands.
Oh, great.
Please.
I'd like to recite a poem that I've written.
Oh, cool.
Laugh, you butterfly that dances in the mud.
Laugh, you piece of dental floss.
- You burn me toast.
- Yeah.
Laugh, you pig that flies in the sky with rainbow Twinkie fluid and three liters of high-octane petrol.
Oh, yeah.
- Whew.
- Yeah, heh, heh.
- Bravo.
- Yes, sir.
Hit it again.
Thank you.
Now, let's pray.
Uh! Uh!
Come on, Jet.
Here we go...
What are you doing?
We're praying to the spirit of freedom.
Prophet taught us religion.
Hallelujah!
Damn right.
- Come on.
- Oh, no, I can't, I'm not good at...
It's okay, I have condoms.
Yay, Jet!
Booga, where'd you learn to dance?
Oh, wow.
It's one of Johnny Prophet's dreams.
See how the people are all free and the water just comes down from the sky and it don't cost nothin'.
With flowers and rainbows.
It's beautiful.
This is just like Christmas, isn't it?
- Mm-hm.
- I love opening things.
Especially when you don't know what's inside.
I remember the first Christmas
I got to open something.
- Mm-hm.
- It was a book.
I didn't know what the title was
'cause the cover was ripped off.
But it had these really cool pictures...
- Booga!
- Okay, okay, I'm done.
Let's get this one.
Two, three.
It's dirt.
This is bullshit.
We've been had.
Good job.
Come on, help me open this one over here.
One, two, three.
Jesus Christ.
Johnny Prophet.
Motherfucker Kesslee killed Prophet!
Okay guys, here's the plan.
Water and Power has mines all the way from here to here.
No, there's no way through 'em.
How 'bout we go over 'em?
Yeah, that's great.
How you plan on sneakin' over the top?
- Fly?
- Yep.
We've got the stolen flyer.
All we have to do is paint it back the way it was and pow.
What happens when they ask for a security code?
- Then what, huh?
- Yeah, then what?
Well, uh, maybe we could, uh, wait till another flyer does a routine scout.
We capture his ID code and we're in.
Brilliant.
Okay, I will meet you there.
Wait, what do you mean meet us there?
I'm not goin' in without my tank.
- Gentlemen.
- Let's go.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
We're listenin' to her now?
I thought we were committee.
We gotta vote.
Okay.
Everybody for that pathetic plan, raise your paw.
Majority, let's go.
All right, let's hit it.
Committee.
Condor zero four, respond when airborne.
Okay, okay,
I got us an ID code.
- Cool.
- You are just too cool.
All right, now, try to sound relaxed.
And whatever you do, only repeat what I tell you.
- Got it?
- Yeah.
Okay.
Condor Control, this is Condor zero four, over.
- What did she say?
- Okay.
Condor Control, Condo, um, I mean, um, Condor four, come in, over.
Condor four, we just sent you out.
You must have a stabilizer in your left modifier.
- Okay.
- Come on, go ahead.
Must be a, um, stabilizer in the left, in the modifier.
Condor four, why aren't you using your assigned frequency?
- Must be a short haircut.
- What?
- No!
- Ow.
- Uhhh.
- Short circuit.
Yeeah!
Whoa! Aah!
Get 'em!
Just repeat what she tells you.
You're blowing it!
Say again, zero four.
You're blowing it, Donner, just listen to me okay?
- No!
- We're dead.
We're dead.
Condor zero four, you said you're dead?
All right, that's it.
Turn this boat around or you're gonna get us all killed.
Now! Do it now!
No!
We're going in!
You are gonna listen to me.
For once, you're gonna shut your deformed face and you're gonna let me do my stuff!
Have you got that?
All right.
Home plate, this is Condor four.
We have pirate interference.
Obviously, a Ripper ploy to confuse you.
Now, here's the situation...
This bird has got no electrical and in about two minutes, we're gonna be kissing gravel.
So, listen to me, you spam sucker.
Either you get off your butt and clear us for landing, or I'm going to fly this rocket right up your socket!
Uh, roger, zero four, you're cleared for hangar A.
- Cool.
- Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.
'Bout time.
Damn.
Yeeah!
Start the water.
Shoving a small, innocent child down the pipe and then slowly letting her drown.
Is that wrong?
Move out!
Looks all clear.
Let's go, daddy-o.
- Did you hear that?
- What? I don't hear anything.
Shh! Must be 150 of them.
Hundred and sixty-three.
We're toast.
Actually, 164.
Definitely.
Rebecca.
Are you okay?
Ohhh.
Okay, come on, come on.
Go on.
Go, go, go, go.
No!
You see that light down there?
Light is not our bag.
Yeah, we're much better in the dark like Count Chocula.
Dracula, fool.
Count Chocula is the guy on the laundry detergent box.
Duhh!
- If I asked you something...
- No, he is... he's right.
Shut up.
Thank you.
Could we just figure out what we're gonna do, please?
Well, there are power boxes down at the end of this aisle.
If only we could get to them.
Later, cats.
No!
Sir, we've got action.
Let's get this over with quickly,
Sergeant.
There he is!
Uh!
Hang on a second, we've lost power.
What the hell happened to the lights?
Guard!
Watch our back.
- Oh, no, Deet?
- Deetee, come on, man.
Deetee?
Hold on, man, hold on.
Deetee!
Oh, my God.
No.
I'll see you cats at that big jam in the sky.
Oh, no, no.
No.
Help.
Rebecca, help.
Hang on, I hear you!
Can't breathe.
Please, help me.
I can't breathe.
Please help me.
Heh, heh, heh, heh.
If you're looking for Sam, she's in the pipe!
What, again?
Piece of shit.
Now, there's something about you that's different.
I think it...
I'll tell you what's different.
I've lost my patience.
And you've lost the fight.
Oh, I played you.
I played you like an old fiddle.
Well, uh, maybe we could, uh, wait till another flyer does a routine scout.
We capture his ID code and we're in.
Brilliant.
Jet.
She's been workin' for you this whole time.
No, you were.
You're a walking, talking, living microphone.
I had them planted all over your body.
Thank you for serving up the Rippers.
Uh!
They'll make great shoe leather for my soldiers.
Uh!
Need a hand?
Come on, get up.
- What happened?
- Oh, I'm so pretty.
I'm gonna hit you so hard you're children will be born bruised.
Get up!
P- p-p-p-p-pow.
Uh!
Marvelous, isn't it?
State of the art holographic technology.
Mm.
You know what it means?
It means I can hurt you, but you can't hurt me.
I won and you know it.
Come on.
Say it, say it.
Just say I won.
- I won.
- No! No!
Say I won!
I won.
Hmm, say it.
And the little girl lives.
I'd rather her die than live as your slave.
Uh!
What took you so long?
Well, well, well.
I win.
What's the matter with you?
Finish him!
Aw, shit.
Don't tell me you're out of ammo.
Don't move a muscle.
I hate wastin' good beer for nothin'.
Thirsty?
Get her!
Screw this, man.
Uh!
Die!
Die!
Higher, higher!
Come on!
One for the road.
Die!
I'm melting, I'm melting.
Is that the best you can do?
Try this close to your heart, asshole!
Did I hurt you yet?
It's not over... over.
It's not over... It's not... It's not...
It's not... It's not...
Help.
Hang on, I hear you!
Help, help.
- Hold on.
- Rebecca.
Fuck me.
How many times do I have to tell you?
I don't want to.
It's over.
Don't move!
Down!
See ya in the next world.
Atten-hut!
General, uh, we have taken out the airfields and now have control of the bridge.
Awaiting your next command, sir.
I, uh, I took the bullets out of their guns.
Real smart, huh?
Booga, that was very smart.
Mm-mm-mm-mm.
Giggles.
Yes.
What do you say we blow this joint?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeeah!
Rebecca, hit the brakes!
Waterfall ahead!
Shut up, you'll ruin the surprise.
Yeeah!
Ker-pow!
Where's the Captain, Mr Spock?
He's out there, Doctor.
Out there somewhere in a thousand cubic parsecs of space.
And there is absolutely nothing we can do to help him.
Bogey inbound,
500 miles from Rockport.
- Roger, tac-com. You got it too?
- What is it?
I don't know. Signal has it at 500 miles, inbound real fast.
That's not one of ours.
We've confirmed inbound bogey.
Werewolf, flight camera's now on.
Man, is he moving!
Unidentified aircraft,
you are violating restricted airspace.
Reduce speed to mach one.
Descend to 3,000 feet and identify, or we will force you down.
Bogey not responding.
He's walking away fast.
Suggest Air National Guard intercept.
This is Cowboy. I got a lock-on.
Request permission to fire.
You are cleared to fire.
Mebs, you should've activated the cloaking device.
I cannot remember everything!
He's disappeared.
He's just disappeared!
Greetings.
- You need a room?
- Correct.
Fill out an application.
Just a form.
I seek out techno-industrial sector where I can purchase two simlats of platinum paste.
This time of night, huh?
Gee, let's see.
See, I'm kinda new to the area.
Where can I obtain a helium grafting device operable at eight fathoms?
The day guy knows this area really good. I can't help you.
- Is this a double occupancy?
- Correct. That is my mate.
Yeah, right. I'm sure she is.
That's... That's fine. OK.
Will that be cash or charge?
How will you pay for the room?
We shall remunerate with metallic tender-discs.
- Correct.
- This is fine.
This is a primitive device.
We need one with the right components to contact Remulak.
The Highmaster will be displeased about our ship.
Affirmative. He will surely cut off my plarg and hand it to me.
But do not despair.
We will be rescued.
Until then, we must adapt.
When the hydrogen droplets have ceased, we will live undetected amongst the blunt skulls.
Beldar, how can we live among the blunt skulls?
We will blend in.
My goodness, Mike Sanders. Wow.
Here's the man that made it happen last match.
Hey, Otto, this dude's almost as fast as you are.
No, this boy is the best.
Shows up on time, gives me an honest day's work.
You can't find people like this.
That's right.
White boys and the brothers show up late, loaf around.
- All they want is a cheque.
- I heard that.
Here is your Superjuicemaster.
Frequent cleaning of blades will prevent wear and accumulation of bacteria.
I told you, he's good.
If I could find three more like him,
I could retire.
It is time for midday cessation of activities for protein-carbo intake.
- Sure. Take your lunch break.
- Lunch. Lunch.
The boy loves to eat.
Lunch. Lunch.
Greetings, earthwoman.
Time for midday consumption of mass quantities.
I have re-radiated leftover starch disc.
Pizza. I will enjoy it.
There. Warning. Do not sear the top of your neck hole in the molten lactate extract of hoofed mammals.
Excellent. The final component for the intergalactic communicator.
Correct.
There.
Perhaps tighten the spiral dimension fasteners.
Beldar, activate the device!
Inform Marlax of our situation.
There is no advantage to delay.
Verscrub.
Phone home!
Omglath Marlax.
We haven't heard from you in clarsogs.
I'm glad your life functions are active.
Greetings, Marlax.
I trust you have enslaved the planet.
Unanticipated failure of mentaglion drive has caused us to abandon our vessel in a fluid mass.
At what time coordinates can we expect a rescue vessel?
Rescue vessel? You tarpaath!
I'd not like to be in your cone when the Highmaster hears this.
He will not take it lightly.
I'll arrange for a starcruiser
to enter your solar system in seven zerls.
Seven zerls!
Flargans. Remulak. Narpail.
Marlax, wait!
Seven zerls!
We should discuss something that is far more important than planetary conquest.
What could be more important than planetary conquest?
Beldar, I am with Cone.
You? I? A young one?
Affirmative.
$8,000. This is the best week
I've ever had.
- And there's 1,200 for you, Beldar.
- Thank you.
You still haven't given me your social security number.
My social security number?
I am sorry. I keep forgetting.
I need it. I got state payroll forms, workman's comp.
You do have a number?
Of course.
I am a citizen of this planet.
Alright, my man, give me the numbers.
O... two... five...
...six...
...X point three...
...O... B...
...eight...
...seven...
You don't have a social security number?
Correct.
- Why not?
- I am an illegal alien.
I knew you were too good to be true!
Every time I make money, this happens. Where you from?
The planet Remulak.
I am Fuel Survey Underlord for...
Never mind.
Look, we'll work this out.
Here's the deal.
Your name is Donald R De Cicco.
Donald R De Cicco.
That's you. D-E capital-C-l-C-C-O.
Born August 11th, 1951, in Brockton, Massachusetts.
- Brockton.
- And your name is?
- Donald R De Cicco.
- Right. Nice to see you.
Your wife is Mary Margaret Rowney, born June 26th, 1955, in Rhode Island.
- You're from where?
- Brockton.
My mother's from there!
You were married
June 4th, 1975, in Greece, where you met after your graduation from Hobart College.
- Hobart.
- Hobart College.
He's a wizard.
Everything you need is here.
Birth certificates, school records, employers' addresses, grandmother's maiden name.
They won't ask, but it's there.
And social security numbers. Name?
Donald R De Cicco.
Nice to meet you.
Welcome to the United States.
Right there. Up and down.
This is a fine craft.
It can be operated with ease.
Not so close, alright?
I'm not against closeness, it's just not my thing.
In America, we got this thing called space. There you go.
If you're gonna live here and have kids, get yourself together.
Buy yourself a car, maybe get a hat for that head.
And do something about those teeth.
You know what the key to success is?
I do not.
I'm gonna tell you.
Look good. Be your own boss.
Never get chained to a desk. When it comes to business, take cash only.
Look good, be own boss, no desk, cash only.
You got it.
- Got any more of that gum?
- Of course.
But if I chew and drive
I might hit something.
Please, I'm better with English.
All I'm getting is clicking noises.
Clicking?
Could you be a lamb and have a seat?
Take-o uno seataro, por favor.
Hi, there. I'll take that.
Mr Seedling can't see anyone.
He's having one of those days.
Isn't that cute?
OK, that's not yours.
Bear in mind these figures are not to scale.
I suggest we put electronic collars on all the deportees.
We bury a wire along the border, forming an invisible fence.
The next time this illegal tries to enter the country...
A jolt he won't soon forget.
It'll send a nice message to the rest of the population.
Let's get on this.
Why am I the only one who sees the problem?
I don't know.
Everyone else hopes the problem will go away. It won't.
You're right. It won't disappear.
- Maybe I should give up.
- No.
- Sure. Be like everybody else.
- It's not you.
- Let the country be overrun.
- You wouldn't be happy.
That's why I have to give it everything. 100 percent.
- Everyone thinks it's crazy.
- And obsessive.
- That I'm a mental case.
- Completely insane.
I have something for you.
That deceased SSI number you flagged.
De Cicco's back. That's the tenth job he's taken this month.
Not bad for a guy who was shot dead in a clam bar in Sheepshead Bay.
Now Mr De Cicco is working as an appliance repairman.
Let's see. Donald De Ciccos one through five turned out to be a Samoan, a Vietnamese, a Sicilian, a Canadian...
- And a Belgian.
- He skipped back to Belgium.
I lost him, Eli. This one I want.
Dr Rudolph, this is Mr De Cicco. He wants his teeth capped. All of them.
OK. We'll just take a look.
Hello, Mr De Sicko.
De Cicco. The name is De Cicco.
I'm Dr Rudolph. Can we send for your regular dental records?
When I was young,
I chipped a tooth horn on my rocket sled in a vurl storm.
But there were no records which we could send from where... we come from.
Alright.
Now, I understand you want to have your teeth capped.
- Correct.
- Let's just take a look.
And open, please.
And close, please.
And open, please.
OK, we'll start the caps right about here, Mr De Fasco.
De Cicco.
And open wider, if you can.
- Headrest comfortable?
- Fine.
Alright. I'm going to give you some nitrous oxide.
If you feel any pain, let me know.
And breathe.
Beldar!
Mebs!
Human authority figures!
We must egress immediately.
They are at the portal.
We are scrabnord!
INS! Open up!
Go round the back.
There they go!
Egress!
Turnbull!
OK. No foreign passports, letters, newspapers.
Nothing to indicate their country of origin, except these Mardi Gras suits.
Let me see. Maybe they're Brazilian.
Sir?
It'd be better if that went through me.
He's not in a good mood. Thanks.
I think I found something, sir.
That symbol also appears on this card.
Let me see that.
- Possibly Korean.
- Possibly.
- Have this text analysed.
- OK. Run this.
Look at this filth. It's filthy.
Human beings don't live like this.
- Find out where they're from.
- On it.
Because wherever that is...
...I'm seeing to it that they go back there.
LaGuardia Airport. Delta terminal.
Do you wish I take the BQE, the Van Wyck, or Woodhaven Boulevard to Grand Central Parkway?
There are more lights but less traffic.
- Whatever. Just get there.
- Woodhaven.
345, drop-off, LaGuardia.
- Greetings.
- Greetings, my geneto-mate.
How was your day ferrying humans across the grid?
Acceptable.
Tips could have been better.
The impending Cone prepares for its emergence.
It's Khoudri. Welcome, my employer and landlord.
Forgive my intrusion. Ravi is sick.
Can you work the midnight shift?
- Use my car.
- Certainly.
But it will be the last triple shift.
The birth spasm is near.
Beldar, once again you have pulled me from the fire.
Yes.
You worked through your slar phase again.
Guz deprivation is not good.
But this dwelling is no longer acceptable.
Even by earth standards it is not good enough.
We must move to a safer neighbourhood with better schools and a stronger economic matrix which will not tax us to death.
We are no better off than we were two zerls ago.
This dwelling is available at $6,900 down with a nine percent fixed-rate mortgage.
Our currency stock is insufficient.
Incorrect. You have been working.
I have been saving.
Ah, I praise you, earthwoman.
My pluvarb has broken.
The birth spasm has begun.
Nothing to this. Childbirth is a gentle act of nature.
We'll get plenty of good pictures.
I hate you, Beldar. I hate you!
Two, three...
Swab.
- Breathe easy.
- One good push.
It's so cute!
Would you like to cut the umbilical cord, Mr Conehead?
No. No hair. Bring the top of the head up higher.
No, higher, like a point.
We have the analysis from the labs on the card found at the dwelling.
No known language within the foreign catalogue nationality encodes.
You're not listening to me.
Look, here. See where my hand is?
That high. What else?
The Mardi Gras costumes contain fibres with five unknown polymer strands.
Nothing like it anywhere.
What are they saying?
They're from another planet?
That theory has been advanced.
This is big. This is really big.
Aren't creatures from another planet
Air Force responsibility?
If they're just visiting, sure.
But the moment they try to work here, they're mine.
- Any sign?
- No, sir. Nothing yet.
Wait.
- Subject vehicle coming your way.
- Copy. I have him in sight.
- Go?
- No.
- Go?
- No.
- Now?
- Go!
Freeze!
This isn't him! What's going on here?
- Look.
- Where'd you get this key chain?
It's a gift, from one of the finest men I've ever known.
- Where is he now?
- He moved out a week ago.
I have no word from him.
I only wish I had more drivers like him.
Diligent, punctual, his cab invariably sweet smelling.
- Take him in and check him out.
- Check him.
Find this insignia, find these illegals.
Hi, there. I'll take that. Thank you.
Sir, good news from Washington.
Your promotion came through.
They must've loved your electrified-border idea.
On-site Field Enforcement Head for the entire Southwest.
Assistant Deputy Commissioner.
That should pay quite a bit more.
It's an extra 1,500 a year.
Of course I'll take it.
Question. About this De Cicco case.
We've invested so many man hours.
Who cares?
Let the next guy handle it.
Morning consumption of mass quantities.
Grid-like breakfast slabs, seared strips of swine flesh and flat chicken embryos.
I will enjoy it.
A seven-letter word for a tomb in ancient Egypt which has smooth, sloping sides meeting in an apex?
A flindar.
- Good morning, parental units.
- Dawn greetings.
What would you like?
Pop Tarts? Chicken embryos?
Ground animal flesh?
I'm not hungry. Just some Tang.
Tang. The drink the astronauts took to the moon.
Astronauts to the moon.
Your putter has arrived.
My Hawk True Flex Power Point with graphite shaft.
A secret of golf pros everywhere.
A truly manly putter.
- What have you done to your cone?
- Nothing.
No? Turn around.
- It's not a real tattoo.
- Mebs! Unacceptable!
Everyone's wearing decals.
If everyone jumped into a cauldron, would you?
I am not a little Cone now.
Maintain low tones with me. Go to the hygienic chamber and remove it.
Also, you have too much lip enhancement.
Mom! My make-up looks OK, doesn't it?
Do not involve the approval of your other parental unit.
If you wish to go to the retail compound, make the necessary corrections and remove the decal.
Fine.
She looked like a common flathrag on payday.
I don't know what went wrong with these roses.
Maybe I need a gardener.
Sweetie, I'm not gonna pay some guy to dig in the dirt.
I told you to take that thing to a professional. You'll save money.
I should've bought an electric one.
Beldar, is that you?
- Correct.
- Bel. Pry.
The damn lawnmower won't start.
You're so good with machinery.
- Would you mind taking a look?
- I do not mind.
Greetings, Lisa. Excellent crop of decorative growth.
- You're being nice.
- Yes.
Three-horsepower internal-combustion chlorophyll-stalk slicer.
- There is fuel in the device?
- Plenty.
I just can't get the damn thing to kick over.
Join us for consumption of mass quantities this weekend.
We'll ignite our flame pit and char mammal flesh.
Sounds fun. I'll make some coleslaw.
Coleslaw? We will enjoy it.
Thanks, Bels.
Connie! How are you?
- I love your hat.
- Hi, Mr Conehead.
I love this song!
- Sorry, it's not ready.
- I do not understand.
I have returned at the agreed-upon time coordinates.
- I'm very sorry, Mr Conhead.
- The name is Conehead.
Well, look, Mr... Conehead, we got a little backed up and it took longer than expected.
Unacceptable. You delayed my departure from here, and all the events which were to follow. Why this deception?
I don't know who you are or where you're from...
France. We come from France.
Fine. The point is, it'll be ready when it's ready.
So if you wanna take a seat over there, we'll call you when your car's finished.
I will comply.
What choice do I have?
It's as if you have seized me at the base of my snarglies.
- Hey, Ronnie?
- What?
How can it take so long to do a simple alignment on a sedan with standard steering when your garage is equipped with a digital hydraulic radiometer?
Maybe cos I was out back finishing a beer.
OK.
Before we can recommend your appointment as Commissioner, we have questions regarding your tenure as District Chief.
Senator, that was long ago, and a busy office.
I won't be able to recall everything.
We won't be asking you about everything. Just case 889343B.
The so-called De...
- De Cicco.
- De Cicco file.
Yes, I do remember that case.
In an unsuccessful pursuit, you authorised the expenditure of $250,000 to apprehend what you believed was an illegal alien from another planet. A spaceman.
Excuse me.
Actually, I never said on the record that I thought they were spacemen.
And the case is still open.
I feel that when we make this apprehension, the expense will be well justified... is what I feel.
My appointment is being held up by that De Cicco case!
I know.
I want the file put back into the system, flagged red.
- Why me?
- I don't know.
The system screws the guy that works the hardest.
- Politicians don't care.
- It's the system.
- Phone's ringing.
- All the time.
- No, Eli.
- The phone! I'll get it.
This guy's out there somewhere.
He's gonna make a mistake.
And when he does, we'll nail him.
I've never dated a girl taller than me before.
Really? I've always been tall.
Are both your parents from Europe?
- When did they come to America?
- Before I was born.
My grandfather's from the old country.
Really? Which one?
I'm not sure. One of the big ones.
My mom's the only other woman
I've ever known who could take a sandwich like that.
- Are you gonna eat that?
- No.
You're something special, you know that?
So Beldar's giving this woman beginner's driving lessons for the fifth time, huh?
That's interesting.
Why is that interesting?
I mean, the same woman.
Think about it.
The same woman.
The more you think about it, the more you probably should worry, because all men are pigs.
Pigs. A domesticated cloven-hoofed vertebrate that defecates in the same place it consumes.
Exactly. You should be very careful with Beldar.
He's got that Continental accent that some women find irresistible.
I like it when you watch me drive.
- Watch it, lady!
- It's funny.
It's like you've been instructing me all my life.
Yes.
It's almost as if you've controlled me completely.
I just don't think I'm ready for this test yet. I can't...
Listen to me.
I'm OK.
I'm just human.
And weak.
Gladys, look at me.
Yeah!
I am your teacher. It is natural you harbour certain feelings for me.
But you must understand, nothing can come of this.
58 US dollars, please.
You are one of the finest men
I've ever met.
When my species rules this planet, your name will be on the protected rolls. You will come to no harm.
You are wise. But there's a sadness to your wisdom.
Ronnie, don't.
Please.
Connie,
I told you how I feel about you.
- Doesn't that mean anything?
- It means a lot.
It's like, I pick you up,
I take you out,
I bring you home, we say goodnight and you never kiss me.
Is there something wrong with me?
Of course not.
It's just...
My parental units...
We've never been really affectionate.
I'm afraid I don't know how.
It's easy.
All you do is lean forward and kiss, like this.
Ronnie, don't.
- I am not ready.
- You're ready!
Don't.
Greetings.
How was your date with Ronnie?
Daddy was right. Earth boys only care about one thing.
- Ronnie behaved like a flairndep?
- Flairndep?
An uninvited grasper of Cone.
A masher. A hustler.
Flairndep?
Hi, Mr Conehead.
- I find you unacceptable!
- Yes, sir.
If I did not fear incarceration,
I would terminate your life functions by applying pressure to your blunt skull to cause its collapse!
Thank you.
Do not worry about Ronnie.
You will not see him in the Laurel Hills quadrant again.
I can't believe you did that.
You've ruined my life!
Young one, when we return to Remulak...
I don't care about Remulak!
That stupid starcruiser is never coming, anyway!
But she said... I thought...
I will attend to the young one.
Come in.
I read in a magazine you can talk to me about anything.
Mom?
What does it feel like to... hone?
Well, for me, the first time, it happened so fast,
I hardly knew I had honed at all.
After that it was more repetition than anything else.
My young one, your cone is changing and you feel unsure.
How would you know what it's like?
You've been married to Daddy for so long.
I was a young Cone myself, once.
Before I met Beldar, I was attracted to a Thorasian forger.
As far as I was concerned, no other life force in the universe mattered.
But then he got a job working at a volcano complex on a moon.
I never saw him again.
It broke my blood-valve chamber.
I got over it.
It worked out for the best, because then I met your father.
I knew then that I had found my true life mate.
I love you, Mom.
The currents of chromo-bonding between you and your parental units are infinite.
Mebs!
Good shot.
So, have you given any thought to what I said about, you know, hair?
I do not understand.
It's me. You don't have to pretend it doesn't bother you.
You're young. No reason for you to be skinny up top.
I'll let you in on a secret.
It's not all my own hair.
- Hard to tell, isn't it?
- Only from very high altitudes.
I'll say no more. Think it over.
- I can introduce you to my man.
- Thank you.
Mr Conehead!
Way to blast out of the bunker, huh?
It's me, Ronnie!
Hope you didn't cut your hand when you tore open my car! I'm fine!
Yes, thank you! No problem!
Goodbye!
- OK.
- Chubby, come on!
OK, Conehead. That puts me four behind you at the turn.
Correct.
Mr Conehead, I'm miserable.
I feel so bad for what I did.
It feels like somebody's ripping my guts out. She won't take my calls.
Hey, kid, I'm not paying you to yak.
Buddy?
What's with the head?
Forget him. He's not a member.
That concludes the one-metre competition.
Next, the three-metre-board category.
First diver for the home team,
Connie Conehead.
A one-and-a-half flip.
Enter the water with as little splash as possible.
Good girl. Keep it up.
You've got one more dive.
Diving for Union High, Gale Jenson.
You were great.
I'm sorry about the other night.
I was a real jerk! OK?
Connie's our best hope for the state finals.
Correct. We believe this also.
I don't think I've ever seen you at any of the parent meetings.
What committees are you on?
We still need volunteers for the homecoming gala.
- Home...
- Coming...
Hi.
Look, I'm sorry if I...
No. I shouldn't have been so...
It was me. Sometimes I just...
Me, too.
- If I thought I did anything...
- No, you didn't.
- I mean it.
- Seriously?
Yeah.
Wow! I'm glad we talked.
Parents and students, if you direct your attention
to the sky, you will be treated to a display of amateur fireworks,
courtesy of Beldar Conehead, father of Connie Conehead.
Careful there, Conehead.
Pretty cheap, Conehead.
Cigar?
Is the light keeping you awake?
No.
Your breathing has become erratic.
A torg for your thoughts.
Beldar, are you content with me?
Of course. Why would I not be?
Now, I would like to enter my slar phase.
Let us suppose my life functions ceased.
- What would you do?
- Incinerate your carcass in the tradition of Ovahdar the Obtuse and put it in a clean, dry place.
Would you find a new geneto-mate to bring to our guz chamber and propagate?
Ah, my most precious one,
I would collapse.
I would draw the shades and live in the dark.
I would never leave my slar pad.
My fluids would coagulate, my cone would shrivel and I would die, miserable and Ionely.
The stench would be great.
You have made me very happy.
Yes, I know. Goodnight.
Life on earth is good.
I agree. Stability and contentment have been achieved.
Lay by and put about.
Return to your port of embarkation.
There is no work for you in the United States.
You have no job skills, you will be a drag on our economy.
We appreciate your situation but we have problems of our own.
- Thank you.
- Phone, sir.
Seedling here.
A fax came through on the secure channel.
I think we've found him.
Don't toy with me.
This time it had better be real.
Hello, Mrs Conehead.
I've been meaning to talk to you about the
Christmas-tree-lighting ceremony.
We've found someone else to head up that committee and won't need
Mr Conehead's services after all.
- If you could thank him for me.
- He will be disappointed.
I'm telling you, Bels, you could win that trophy this year.
A meaningless piece of metal and wood. I compete only with myself.
I appreciate the game for its physics, skill, its self-control and, of course, spirituality.
You're full of it.
You're only coming to the ball because you think you got a shot at winning that trophy.
Negative. But if I should win,
I would accept it with limited enthusiasm.
- Ron. Harv.
- What's happening?
What are you wearing to the Hallowe'en dance?
I am not about to tell you, Harv.
"Consume alco-beverage.
Come get me!"
Ah, mai tai! I will enjoy it.
Greetings, earthman.
It is good to hone in places other than our guz chamber before slar phase.
Who said?
Good Housekeeping.
- What are they doing?
- It's like they stepped on a cat.
- Comdec three.
- Commissioner Seedling.
- We're on 'em.
- Don't make a move without me.
I understand. We won't move until you get here.
Greetings.
Hello. We just stopped by to introduce ourselves.
- We're Jehovah's Witnesses.
- How do you do? I am Beldar.
We attend the Kingdom Hall on Cove Neck Road.
Near the dry cleaner's and the 7-Eleven.
Exactly. May we ask you a question?
Proceed.
Is the world headed towards a calamity?
Definitely. I have direct personal knowledge that this is so.
- Great. May we come in?
- Of course.
Enter. Assume comfort.
- My mate, Prymaat.
- Greetings. Be seated.
So, what do you know of the doom awaiting this planet?
As Witnesses, we believe the end of the world is approaching and that only 144,000 people will be saved to reign.
I do not believe it will be that many.
The Bible clearly states
144,000 will be saved to reign.
Very optimistic, considering the primitive weapons the earth people have.
Some earth weapons are not useless.
Mebs, drop it.
Well, when the time comes, no weapon of this earth shall avail mankind.
Correct.
- Where are you people from?
- France. We come from France.
But we are American citizens now.
- Do you have proof?
- Proof?
Christina's giving me a ride to the dance, so I'll see you there.
I take it your daughter was born here.
Yes. She is native to your plan... country.
Scarlab. Modtrubuim. Beldar. Scarlab.
Beldar? Phone for you.
I will return their call at my earliest convenience.
No, the big phone!
The big phone?
I hope you humans have enjoyed your visit. Come again.
- You are leaving.
- How did you arrive in the US?
Thank you for coming.
They didn't buy it.
You can't talk religion with some people.
Connie!
Ronnie's giving me a ride home tonight, so I won't need a ride.
Negative, young lady.
We must speak now. It is imperative.
I have good news, my young one.
Our rescue vessel from Remulak is coming tonight.
What?
You will finally see the joys of your planet.
- I must tell Ronnie.
- Irrational. You will tell no one.
What if I said I don't want to go?
My infinitely valuable incarnation.
Watching you grow up on this savage planet has caused me pain.
Your optic receptacles have never seen the peaks of Aardsnaap, the Crater of Culdroth, the Mergziod Labyrinth.
I know, and I'm sure it's all great.
And I know that you don't believe me, but I'm in love with Ronnie.
Daddy, if you really care, you'll let me say goodbye to him.
Although my blood valve weighs heavily with your feelings, tonight we must remain together.
You're moving away tonight?
When you get the call to be the President of France's driver, you gotta go.
I have to tell you something really important.
- What is it?
- Not here. We have to be alone.
Alright!
The awarding of the club's
Golfer of the Year trophy...
Not so fast, Carl.
...for most-improved handicap through the season. The winner is
Beldar Conehead!
The daughter and boyfriend are on the move.
Before we do anything at all, there's something I have to say.
I'm different from other girls.
I know. That's why I love you.
She left because something has corrupted her judgement.
When we get back to Remulak,
I am grounding her for a zerl!
Senso-rings?
Where did you get those?
Under your bed.
Unacceptable!
Your cone is too young!
Get up! You're coming to Remulak now!
I am staying with Ronnie!
Maintain low tones. Impossible.
Undesirable. Inadvisable.
Then I'm coming with you.
I love you.
Mebs! Human authority figures.
We must egress immediately.
It's over, Conehead. This is the INS.
Come out with your hands up.
You're under arrest.
They're going for it!
- Cover him.
- Hold it right there!
- It's the boyfriend.
- It's the boyfriend.
Daddy!
Nice manoeuvre, but it's all over.
I think that is the Jehovah's Witness.
Let's cover him.
Hold on, everybody.
I love you, Ronnie!
I love you!
Back in the car, asshole.
Gorman, let go!
I'm scared!
You're not getting away this time.
You're surrounded.
Put the car down!
This is the Captain.
Get into the formplat. We will initiate mentaglion surge once we go past the only moon on this planet.
No problem. We have successfully passed their moon and are preparing now for mentaglion surge.
Remulak!
Vlenglariat pla, Highmaster.
I know every Cone is allowed but four uses of the Bitumius pleasure spool, and I partook six.
I realise the error of these actions.
They will never be repeated.
I throw myself at your mertex.
Fairnob, smerthail.
Smordit.
I realise the pleasure spools are a difficult temptation to resist.
Therefore, you will knarftle the garthok!
No!
Fuel Survey Underlord Beldar
Florhone, and Marlax Zehemsto, from Protoid Fuel Administration.
Beldar, survivor of the wilderness planet.
What do you bring me from the conquered worldlet?
Greetings, Revered One.
I present the gift of two living native beings from the planet.
Do what you want to me, but I won't apologise for doing my job.
The USA cannot solve the employment problems of the universe.
Silence the slave!
Delightful. They will make a fitting sacrifice to Krathnor.
What else did you bring me?
A multitude of gifts from the blunt skulls.
A tyre iron with four-way lug wrench.
An owner's manual for a Ford Lincoln Mercury Sable.
Ford Lincoln Mercury Sable?
A personal conveyance, named for its inventor, a mythical character, and a small mammal.
And a dashboard icon.
- Is this all?
- Certainly not.
Some... chewing gum.
I am sporfed. More than sporfed.
Flarged by this!
Come close.
Close.
What have you done to your face portal?
Your trelgs!
Beldar lived among the blunt heads so long, he had to adapt to survive.
He offered his trelgs.
It is known as dental bonding.
I do not care what the blunt skulls call it.
- Here, it is known as treason.
- Treason?
It is at my discretion to settle things in the ancient ways.
Therefore you will knarftle the garthok!
I am no traitor!
What's a garthok?
Every zerl since the ancient times, when the three moons align, the light causes a garthok to emerge.
So, what's a garthok?
Our seats used to be way up in the back. These are much better.
That is a garthok?
You can really see it from this vantage. These are very good seats.
It is time.
I am Lagtar, disgraced guardsman, prepared to fight for my honour.
These are great seats.
I have learnt much from watching the garthok battle.
It has weaknesses. When my turn comes, I believe I can take him.
And let me know when Elvis gets here.
You're next.
This is a first for me.
- You are next.
- No, he is next.
- No. He said you are next.
- He is next.
You were ahead of me in court.
That was then. This is now.
No, guard, no!
You are next.
Daddy!
- It's a song.
- Big hit on earth.
Mebs.
The day is yours, Beldar.
You have knarftled the garthok.
Therefore, a request may be granted.
- I have such a request.
- Speak freely.
That I be permitted to return to earth.
And, upon my return,
I will conquer the planet earth and enslave the blunt skulls in the name of my Cone heritage.
Request granted.
I wish to take the earth slaves with me.
Narg! You may only take one slave.
Then I take Seedling, the one with higher office.
- Thank you.
- So be it!
Let it be written...
Are you writing this?
...that Beldar shall return to the humo-carb planet, to conquer the blunt skulls!
This is my festival.
Yet I speak and they do not hear.
No one listens.
They do not realise the difficulties of my office.
Power is not easy.
I sit in judgement and rule.
That is all there is for me.
- You have no interior life.
- Highmaster.
Why don't you let me take care of that? He's having a tough day.
Omglath.
Krathnor. Attention all battle-unit commanders.
Entering outer atmospheres of target planet.
Hold your global-ranging positions.
Array mesoton cannon.
Stand ready for my attack order.
The starfleet has entered the earth's atmosphere.
They've entered the earth's atmosphere.
- The moment of glory is upon us.
- Really big day for you, sir.
Arm cannon. Verify global targets.
Hold weapons release until my order.
Warning! Danger to battlefleet.
Enemy laser gun in satellites detected.
Proceed to secondary target.
Lorbsleb. Warning!
Danger to battlefleet!
- Lorbsleb!
- Lorbsleb!
Quickly, my family. Run!
Your happiness and positive perception of me is vital to my existence.
Besides, it is not every day a father can give the world to his child.
I love you, Daddy.
Beldar's life functions have ceased.
The earth weapons have silenced him.
He died bravely in battle.
No death is more glorious.
He will be missed.
- He will walk with the chosen.
- Super guy.
I make this proposal to you. Your life in exchange for a green card.
Agreed, if you demonstrate a job skill that no US citizen possesses.
That is no challenge to me.
- I have no objection.
- Good. Move.
Good evening, Mr Conehead.
Mrs Conehead.
Good evening, Ronnie.
Welcome. Enter.
You look handsome yet uncomfortable in your pubescent ceremonial garb.
- Yeah. You mean my tux?
- Correct.
Connie is doing her beautification ritual. I will summon her.
Ronnie, may I have 55 words with you?
The statistics of young earthlings mangling themselves in cars on prom night makes me insist on maximum safety awareness.
Return at the predesignated time coordinates, and take my car.
Its reinforced alloy superstructure is far superior to that of your rusted-out shit box.
Gee, thanks, Mr Conehead.
Hi, Ronnie. Hi, Daddy.
- This is for you.
- Thanks.
Present yourselves for image emulsification.
Say "lactate extract of hoofed mammals".
Cheese!
Excellent.
Goodnight, Mr and Mrs Conehead.
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
Night.
- Ah, memories!
- We will enjoy them.
Over the water and across the sea... 
on a little island
off the Carolinas... 
there once lived a young girl
with a great gift... 
who thought she knew it all. 
That's me. 
Folks call me Marina, 
and I'm a clairvoyant. 
I've always known what people desire
long before they do... 
and that's just a gift
I was born with. 
Of course, I was always
on the watch for my other half... 
what Grammy d'Arbo
calls your split-apart. 
Mind you, I had my suitors... 
but I was waiting for the signs
to let me know the right one... 
a zigzag rainbow... 
a bolt of lightning
ripping through the sky... 
the usual things
that tell you love's at hand. 
As the years went by, 
I grew fevered with anticipation. 
Grammy told me it was hormones. 
But I knew love
had to be on its way... 
and I could hardly wait
for my journey to begin. 
First, a twin-tailed comet
crossed my path... 
and I was sure
love could not be far behind. 
Next thing I know, 
a magical gift washed up on shore... 
promising travel
to a faraway place. 
And then thejumping mullet fish
yielded up a wedding band... 
an undeniable sign that
I'd soon meet my mate. 
And then one night, 
I saw him in my dream. 
Well, just part of him, actually... 
but what a part. 
It was a lustrous, glowing smile. 
Grammy d'Arbo said you
can tell nothing from a smile... 
unless, of course, you're a dentist. 
Truth be told, I'd had
just about enough of her wisdom. 
I knew what I had seen
in my dream... 
the smile of my split-apart. 
And he'd be coming over the water
and across the sea... 
the man of my dreams. 
My Adonis. 
My Poseidon. 
No. No, my Zeus. 
Which is why I must admit
I was a mite surprised... 
when the tides washed in
my husband-to-be Leo Lemke. 
Grammy d'Arbo always said love
is the leap that won't be denied. 
And what a leap I made... 
from my little island to his. 
Kids, don't waste the water!
You little bastards!
I'll make sausage out of ya!
Ladies, could you help me, please?
Molly, Gina, this is my bride, Marina Lemke.
Bride?
Welcome to the neighborhood.
Leo. You'll get a hernia.
Love's made a young man of me.
No peeking, now.
No peeking.
It's for wrapping the meat.
That's right! You always got to wear an apron. Always.
And you'll be working here, behind the counter.
- It's fragile.
- Sorry.
The most important part of the business... keeping the customer satisfied.
Oh, Leo, you're back.
Hey, Harper, you're holding me up?
Oh. This?
The writers decided that Harper's gonna kill somebody next week.
Of course, they haven't decided whom.
But I decided I'd start working with the weapon... so I'd be more in-the-moment when it comes.
Honey, this is Robyn Graves.
She's Harper on Our Daily Bread. 
- Big TV star.
- Well, hardly.
And this is Marina Lemke... my wife.
Pleased to meet ya.
Your wife?
I mean, my God.
Congratulations.
That's wonderful.
Leo, you sneaky devil.
You didn't even tell me you were seeing anybody.
So...
I was just showing Marina around the shop.
- We're not really open.
- Oh, no, Leo.
You got to help me, please. Please?
I got some stuff in the freezer if you want.
- Just something for the barbecue.
- Let me see what I can do ya.
So Leo married.
And you too. That's great.
- When did you two meet?
- Two days ago.
You're kidding.
Oh, that's so brave.
I mean, it's just that it seems so sudden.
- How did you know he was the one?
- I dreamed about him.
Oh, God.
I wish I got some answers when I'm asleep.
All I ever dream about is being on stage naked... which is so textbook I'm embarrassed to tell my boyfriend about it.
- He's a shrink.
- Shrink?
Psychiatrist.
And I know that he wishes...
I had more complicated dreams, so...
I make 'em up sometimes.
Maybe I could borrow yours.
"Honey, I dreamed
I was at my wedding last night... and you were the one.
The one and only."
How will I ever know for sure?
Oh, you'll know.
There's love waiting for you behind a friendly face.
There'll be big changes... and a nice surprise... but don't be scared of it.
Just stand up to it.
Destiny has a way of working itself out.
That's what Grandma d'Arbo always says.
Then Alex is it.
I think you're right.
I think we've both been just fooling ourselves... with all this talk about shared independence... when basically at heart...
I am an old-fashioned girl.
- I could just die...
- Here you go, sweetheart.
A couple of London broils. You can defrost them in the microwave.
Thanks, Leo.
You know, your wife...
Is something special, all right.
Robyn, we've been driving all day... and this is our first night home together.
We got to close up now.
Oh, God.
How insensitive of me.
Okay.
- Leo, what do I owe you?
- You can pay me next time.
- I don't got any change.
- Oh, hey.
Thank you. We'll talk?
Looking towards it.
- See you later.
- Bye.
Honey... how come you told her all that stuff?
Just thought she might want to know.
Welcome back!
I hear congratulations are in order.
Hey, Doc!
Meet my new bride, Marina.
- You all right?
- I'm fine.
I was just careless.
Yeah.
- I hope you have enough space.
- Oh, plenty.
You know, I wasn't expecting to bring home a new wife.
That thing's awful loud.
I got a brand-new digital alarm clock from the bank.
Want me to put this in the living room?
Oh, no. This clock's been with my family since heaven started.
- It's a perpetual motion clock.
- There's no such thing.
Well, sure.
Grandma d'Arbo says those ticks are the heartbeat of a marriage... two hearts beating as one.
That's nice, honey.
Don't you go anywhere.
You can't beat Bessie.
Who's that?
Oh, Bessie Smith... the empress of the blues.
- How come it sounds so scratchy?
- It's an original pressing.
Very rare.
No one's ever wanted me to dance with them before.
- I can't believe that.
- Well, it's the truth.
This town is just crackling with current.
I'm never going to get to sleep.
I was thinking... maybe you could take me out to meet some of the neighbors.
We got to get up early tomorrow.
We got a big delivery coming.
I think it's going to be late arriving.
Something... Cracked axle.
- I'm getting good at this.
- You sure are.
So what do you say?
I say I'm one lucky butcher.
I'm sure glad I found you.
I found you.
I'm sorry. It's just, you took me by surprise.
I thought our next decision is living together, not marriage.
Where did this come from all of a sudden?
The butcher's wife.
What?
Leo's wife.
I've been to a lot of clairvoyants in my time... and this one is the real thing.
She's a very wise woman.
I could tell.
Leo's married to a clairvoyant?
And she told me...
"Love is waiting for you behind a friendly face.
Don't be scared of it.
You can stand up to it."
Where the hell did Leo meet a gypsy?
Alex, do you want to get married or not?
- Before we answer that question...
- Oh, God.
Sit down.
If she's going to have such a profound effect on us...
I'd like to know more about her.
- Could we get off her and on to us?
- I'm concerned.
No, curious. Yes.
If you're going to talk about getting married... why would you approach some strange woman in a butcher shop?
Why wouldn't you just come to me?
Forget it! Just forget it!
I should've told you I dreamed it.
We'd be at the altar by now.
- Can we talk about this rationally?
- No.
Can you fight like a man instead of a shrink?
All I am trying to say is that marriage is an inspired decision.
And I told you I'm uncomfortable with the term "shrink."
Shrink!
"We are all in the gutter... but some of us are looking at the stars."
Who'd have done that?
- It's beautiful.
- It's vandalism.
I could wash it off for a couple of bucks.
Don't you want to let it stay put?
What?
Well, what would it hurt?
We got some chores around the shop, if you're handy with a broom.
- We do?
- Sure.
We've got that big delivery arriving late this afternoon.
This morning.
Can I talk to you for a minute?
Excuse me.
I know this kid. He's trouble.
No, I don't see that.
Maybe a little misunderstood.
He could use a job.
What do you say?
Hey, what are you waiting for?
Get in here before he changes his mind.
Eugene, come on out here!
Just come on out here!
I want you to go out and sweep out the back room.
- Right now?
- No. Tomorrow.
And a dollar and a quarter.
You stop back soon.
Thanks. I will.
Love your window.
It's so original.
Thank you. See ya later.
Afternoon, Dr. Tremor.
What would you be needing?
I'm just looking for someone.
He's in the back.
I wouldn't fret yourself none over Eugene.
- He's a good boy.
- Of course he's a good boy.
Doctor, Leo said the chops are real nice today.
Good. I'd like to talk to you for a moment.
Sorry, Doc.
I'm on the clock.
Then I'll just take a moment of your time.
It's okay. Go on.
Eugene, what are you doing?
- I'm sweeping out the bad luck.
- What?
It's a sedge broom from Ocracoke.
That's an island off the coast of North Carolina, where I'm from.
Will you excuse us for a moment?
Eugene...
- Did you forget our appointment?
- I got a job now.
I don't need a shrink anymore.
I don't think he likes being called that.
I'm sorry.
- Hey, Doc. How's it going?
- I'm fine. Thanks, Leo.
Just trying to have a chat with Eugene, if that's all right.
Sure, sure.
Take your time.
Honey, what are you doing cutting up all those chops?
We'll have no place to put them when the delivery truck shows up.
I don't see that as a problem.
They won't be arriving today.
- They called?
- No, not yet.
- I'm really getting good at this.
- I thought we had an agreement.
You were going to see me until the end of the summer... before we decided whether you need a shrink... psychiatrist.
That was an agreement that you and my probation officer made.
I'm just a troubled kid, Doc.
Who's been telling you that?
You're no trouble at all.
Eugene, I am thrilled you found a job.
It's a positive move, but I don't think it precludes therapy.
We've still got some things to talk about.
Honey, those chops are gonna dry out.
Nobody's gonna want to buy them tomorrow.
It's all in the rhythm, isn't it?
Out of my way, asshole.
Oh, thank God you're open.
He's standing there with that little-boy-lost look.
"I'm an artist, so it's cool if my right brain's oatmeal.
Did Jackson Pollack remember to bring home veal chops?"
I said,
"Cut it out, Julian.
That stopped being cute the day you got out of art school.
I pay for the food!
You can pick it up!"
So now I've got a sit-down dinner for 24 influential critics... and art dealers in less than three hours.
I'm hoping one will discover the bugger and take him off my hands.
Of course you're thinking,
"It's her fault.
What kind of sane woman gets involved with a man... with pretensions to paint?"
But I'm throwing myself on your mercy.
I need veal chops.
Lots of them. Now.
- What's this?
- Veal chops. Lots of them. Now.
How'd you do that?
- Oh, great window.
- Bye.
Yeah. How did she do that?
Eugene, why don't you stop by tonight at 6:00?
We'll talk about this choice.
Don't worry, Doctor.
I'll take good care of him.
I appreciate that, Mrs. Lemke.
Say hey to your gal for me.
Oh, that's right.
You and Robyn had a brief... or, shall we say, influential, encounter.
I'm curious, Mrs. Lemke.
Why would you suggest we get married?
What I say and what people hear aren't always the same thing.
Don't you find that in your calling, Doctor?
I never told your sweetheart to marry with you.
I can see you sparking to her.
A man like you needs someone bigger than life itself.
But she's not gonna be the one you'll settle with.
Could you give me a hand?
Yes. Sure.
Thanks.
Can I offer you a little professional advice?
A scholar like you?
I'd be honored.
Good.
I believe in female intuition,
Mrs. Lemke, to an extent...
It's just a specific manifestation of the collective unconscious... but you might want to be careful about ordering your life... or anyone else's for that matter... on such a primitive instinct.
I'll keep that in mind.
Good. Good.
Would you get the door?
Eugene, I'll see you later.
That boy's tongue's long enough to cut his throat.
I was going to say that.
Honey, it's for...
You want to get that?
Lemke's.
What do you mean you can't get here?
I need the goddamn beef today!
I better take my mess out of here.
- What? A cracked axle?
- Eugene, mind the store.
You bet.
Wash your hands before you touch that meat.
Hi, girls.
How are you today?
Good, real good.
Just out for a stroll.
I don't think
I've seen you here before.
I just moved up here with my husband.
Maybe you know him.
His name's Leo Lemke.
The butcher?
Hi. Let me know if you need help.
Well, actually, I do.
I'm looking for something dowdy and plain.
What's the occasion?
A church recital.
"Lead us not into temptation."
It's so glamorous.
You know, with your hair done up and some nice shoes...
Been a while since you were in church.
I see you wearing this at a nightclub... and you're standing in front of a room full of people... and you're... and you're singing.
You could always frump these up with pearls and pumps.
I'll take this one.
How much are these?
Those are 350.
I think I got that.
This is three.
I got the change.
There you go.
I got to get back to work.
Thank ya.
See ya later.
I think I've made a breakthrough.
I'm gonna sing the blues.
Sing the blues.
What exactly does that mean to you?
A lounge act.
Actually, I met this wonderful woman... in a clothing store... and I don't remember exactly what she said... but it feels right.
I'm gonna sing.
All right.
You feel you'd like to sing.
But why do you think a clerk in a clothing store... is having such a profound effect on you?
No, no.
She's not a clerk.
I think she works in the butcher's shop... or something, but... she is so wise.
Stella... a woman as intelligent and insightful as yourself... doesn't need some clairvoyant to tell you how to live your life.
That's why we're here.
Do you really think she's clairvoyant?
- Hi.
- Good evening.
Who did that to your window?
Maybe I should do something like that at the store.
About those shoes...
Oh, they are so cozy.
You're working in them?
What's that for?
Supper... for you and a friend.
Friends I got plenty of.
It's love that's left me wanting.
Well, don't despair.
It takes as long as it takes.
What?
It bothers Leo when I get to talking this way.
There's two faces.
No, it's one face with two sides.
On one side... there's violence.
But not to her. It's...
It's just to men who've treated her unkindly.
On the other... she's looking for love... but she's confused...
'cause she... well, 'cause she's just looking for... she's just looking for it in the wrong house.
God love her.
I can't wait.
You just stick close to your front porch.
You're gonna be cooking for two real soon.
Hey, do you think my husband would like me in something like that?
I mean, it's just so sophisticated, and... you know.
No.
I think you look great.
What do I owe you?
Oh, goodness, nothing.
It's a gift.
Thanks.
- Thanks.
- See ya later.
Marina, there's a lot of nuts in this city.
You don't want people thinking you're one of them.
So, how about, like... no more of this hocus-pocus talk, huh?
Goodness, Leo, I'm just trying to help out.
Honey, we're in the business of selling meat, not giving advice.
I got to tell you, it's giving me the creeps.
How come?
I...
You...
I got to go get a drink.
Hey, Leo.
I just heard the news.
How's married life?
Hit me, Luis, hard.
Darling!
Honey!
Come over here, sweetheart.
Molly, Gina.
How are you ladies this evening?
Fine. Come.
Sit down. It's for you.
Thank you.
So... how's love everlasting?
Oh, we're just smoothing out the creases.
Everything has a way of working itself out, doesn't it?
A wedding present.
You need a mojo.
It's a sack of charms.
Some herbs, dried flowers, a little spice.
Some roots, nut shells, spider webs, candle wax.
Personally, I like cumin.
Yeah?
You use cumin?
I never use cumin.
Goat's hair is nice.
It helps clear up the vision, so what you see is...
What you end up getting.
Exactly.
Thank you, ladies.
You know, though... what's meant to be just can't be changed.
Hard times demand an open mind.
Wear it.
Nice shoes, Alex.
Jackie Gleason collection?
You like 'em?
By the way, I can't go away with you and Robyn next weekend.
What do you mean you can't go away next weekend?
Something came up.
I rented this house five months ago.
I've been looking forward to this weekend together.
It was unexpected.
We're supposed to relax and have fun, goddamn it.
I scheduled you a blind date for Saturday night.
I already have a date, thank you.
Oh, that's something else.
- Bring her along.
- I don't know who she is yet.
- I'm curious.
- Oh, no.
No, no.
You have a date with somebody... but you don't know who it is.
- Shut up and putt.
- No.
I'm always interested when my friends show... early signs of dementia praecox.
Listen, Alex...
I know it sounds flaky, but I met this wonderful woman... and she says I'll be cooking for two soon... and I really want to believe her.
- Believe who?
- The butcher's wife.
I knew that one day... 
one day... 
I ran from you, Chauncey, 
as far as I could. 
So why do I keep ending up
back in your arms? 
Because that's where
you were meant to be... 
safe and warm
in my sweet embrace. 
Come to Uncle Chauncey, 
my little passion flower. 
I only want
what's best for us. 
I told you one of us
would end up hurt. 
Why does everything
I touch die? 
It's the gun, sweetheart.
- The gun.
- One little box he brings down!
A big man like that, he brings one box! One teeny little box!
Let's load this thing up!
I can't believe it.
It's an awfully long distance from Georgia.
Hey, Eugene.
I got this thing for you, and I wanted to give it to you.
I wanted you to open it here.
- Thanks.
- Just a little present... but it means something special to me, and I wanted to give it to you.
Eugene, she's beautiful.
Come here.
I named her Rosalita.
She's so sweet.
Hey, Rosalita.
You like her?
Oh, she's beautiful.
Thank you so much.
Eugene, you're late!
Get your butt in gear now!
Go on.
Leo, if you want to pass words with me... will you please not take it out on him?
Bless you.
Are you wearing some new kind of perfume?
I think you may be allergic to my new mojo.
Let me get you a tissue.
- Here you go.
- What the hell is that?
Oh, this is Rosalita.
Isn't she sweet?
What do you want with a live chicken?
No, don't tell me.
Don't... Don't tell me.
I don't want to know.
Don't say nothing.
Just don't.
It's just a little chick.
I never thought I'd see the inside of a shrink's office.
It looks so normal.
I was expecting something a little more psycho.
Pervy, you know?
Uh-huh.
How can I help you, Leo?
I don't need help.
I'm normal.
It's my wife.
I mean, I know we've only been married for a couple of days... but I think she might be nuts, if you know what I mean.
Yes.
I think I have an idea.
Though "nuts" isn't a word
I'm comfortable with.
Me neither.
See, we got married real quick, like the day we met.
She insisted.
Swear to God, she told me
I was the man of her dreams.
I had no idea she really meant it.
So we took some holy vows.
I believe a man is only as good as his vows... but now I think maybe she married me
'cause of these dreams of hers.
She believes in 'em, Doc.
It's not natural.
It could be some sort of complex in her head, right?
Which means she's nuts.
And if she's nuts, how do I even know if she loves me?
So I'm thinking... dreams, nuts...
Sounds like your field.
And she's really spooking me now, Doc.
She's got some live chicken running around... and she's wearing some hojo around her neck.
You gotta cure her, or we're in big trouble.
Doc, I been to Brooklyn.
I know about voodoo.
Hey, Leo.
- Where's the new missus?
- She's fine, thanks.
I said where.
Never mind.
Make sure she gets this, okay?
Yeah, sure.
So when you going to give it to her?
- Don't worry.
- Do I look worried?
It's a love token.
It'll seal your love forever.
Jesus.
Oh, Mrs. Lemke.
Did I...
Oh, boy. Did, I...
Did I leave the door unlocked?
Where's the couch?
I don't use a couch.
I don't know if you've ever been in therapy before.
- That's my chair.
- Oh, it is?
Well, it's nice.
It's important you know... that I can be of absolutely no help... unless you want to be here.
You, of course, are free to go at any time.
I promised Leo I'd come.
Good. Why?
Well, I expect he thinks
I'm a little touched.
"Touched"? Interesting word.
What exactly does it mean to you?
Well, that's a fine question.
I reckon it's 'cause I know things before he does... and that just gives him the shivers.
Yes.
Well, come on.
Women have been burned for less.
So you know things.
Like telling a total stranger that she should... get up in front of a crowd and sing... when she might not be ready for such a bold move... and is liable to get terribly discouraged.
You know Stella?
Or telling a lonely woman that she should wait for love to find her... when she'd be better off getting out there and finding...
But that's all true.
Or telling my girlfriend that she should marry me.
Now, here we go again.
No. People...
I can't help what I see, can I?
But you can help what you say.
Do you have visions?
Do you hear voices?
Premonitions?
Do you roller-skate?
How exactly does roller-skating figure into your gift?
Oh, it doesn't.
I just wanted to have a little fun.
Yeah, well, it is highly unorthodox to leave the office with a patient.
I'm not your patient, Doctor.
I'm doing it for Leo.
If you want to hear how crazy I am, you better just lace up.
What am I doing here?
Some crazy woman in the clothing store put me up to this.
No wonder I'm in therapy.
I'm too impressionable.
Don't you think?
You'll be great.
If only I were black,
I'd feel so much better.
Luis, rye and soda.
Hold the soda.
Make it a double.
I don't want to talk about women... and I don't want to talk about my wife.
Oh, you're married?
Leo, this is Stella Kefauver, our new lounge act.
She's gonna class up the joint.
You got your work cut out for you.
Hit me again, Luis.
Bessie Smith?
You sing Bessie Smith?
A skinny little thing like you?
- Okay, I'll sing the Debby Boone.
- No, no, no.
I love Bessie.
Stella, you're on.
You're welcome.
You been holding out on me, Luis?
What do you think?
Good evening.
For my first selection...
I would like to sing
"In the Dark."
In the dark
It's just... 
Sorry.
It's all right.
It's okay.
Oh, boy.
In the dark
It's just you and I
Not a sound
There's not one sigh
Just the beat of my poor heart
In the dark
But soon
This dance will be ending
And we're gonna be missed
Gee
But I'm not pretending
'Cause I swear it's fun
Fun to be kissed
Oh, in the dark
Now we will find
What the rest
Have left behind
Just let them dance
We're gonna find romance
In the dark
Boy, I miss the wind.
You know, no wind will make you stale.
You were going to explain to me... about the mechanics of your clairvoyance.
You know, it's so good to cut loose.
Yeah. It sure is.
Mrs. Lemke, come on.
I promised your husband.
Please.
Okay.
- You all right?
- Yeah. Good.
It's like you're standing in the middle of a doughnut.
And depending on which way you turn, you can tell... what's going on in folks' lives.
If you lean one way, it's like "whoosh."
You just catch a piece of the past.
And if you turn yourself a bit... you'll bump right into the future.
But it's like somebody's running me my own private picture show... in stops and starts.
I'm curious.
What do you mean, "picture show"?
Here. Give me your hands.
Well, there's the sea... and your little naked body... and you're curling your toes up in the sand.
White flowers at a funeral.
Your mama.
She's real glad that she gave you that red drum set.
And there you are, barely six.
You've got these red bumps all over... and they're just making you itch.
You just want to scratch.
Seven.
I was...
I was seven.
Move me again
because I don't care
Move me 'cause I don't care
Luis, champagne for Mrs. Kefauver.
Miss. And call me Stella.
Champagne? What do you think this is, the Copa?
We got Bud Light on draft.
Stella, you are music to my ears.
Gorgeous.
You sing like an angel.
A choir of angels.
Thank you so much.
You are some sort of singer, lady.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
You know, I hear your songs... and I get pictures in my head.
All soft and dreamy.
Like the movies.
Leo, do you really think so?
There aren't many of us that like blues. We got to stick together.
I'd like that.
This ain't the kind of place
I imagined you working at.
You imagined me?
Yeah. Sure.
But I always thought you blues singers... slept all day and stayed out all night.
- And lived in Paris.
- Yeah.
I know.
And now I'm here teaching holy music to pimply-faced kids.
So, Leo... what's on your mind?
I got to tell you something.
Sure. Anything.
It's about my wife.
The thing is...
I don't think we got married for the right reasons.
It seemed to make sense when she proposed, but... I don't know.
Maybe I just don't know how to be her husband.
Since I brought her back here, nothing's been working out.
Maybe it's just not meant to be.
No. She keeps telling me
I'm the man she was meant to marry.
The thing is...
Stella, I know it's not right, but...
I got this feeling for you.
I got the same feeling too.
But my wife... she's so fragile.
It would send her right off the deep end.
A short trip for her.
You're right.
We'll have a higher love.
We won't wallow in the degradation of earthly desires.
Jesus, you even talk like an angel.
A toad.
I don't know what to say.
How...
How thoughtful.
It's hard to get your bearings when you can't even see the stars.
Yes. Yes.
The other night, you were looking for the stars... in your nightgown.
You were watching me?
Last week I saw something
I still don't believe... and I've studied the stars since I was a kid.
I saw a twin-tailed comet just... right in.
Really? Me too.
That was my definite sign that love was on its way.
How exactly did you come to marry Leo?
I was supposed to marry Leo.
I knew it when I saw his smile in my dreams.
He's my split-apart.
What's a split-apart?
Long ago before man and woman... when time was young, there were these beings.
- Beans?
- Beings.
Oh. Beings.
Yeah.
Right.
So we were kind of odd-looking... but just as happy as pigs in a puddle... and we didn't need no one for nothing, and...
And we could reproduce by ourselves and... Yeah.
You don't know this story.
- You can't.
- I do. I do.
Go ahead. Try me.
Okay.
The spirits that ruled the world then...
Envied our joy and independence.
And so they split us apart.
Like clams on a half shell and then scattered us to the wind.
You can still see the scar... which, of course, is the... navel.
Right.
The bellybutton.
You were saying.
So we're the kinfolk of these old split-aparts... and mostly we're miserable on account of we spend our lives...
Iooking for our long-lost other half.
And sometimes... getting so caught up in that search for that special person that... they don't even notice.
Boom, there they are.
Right before their very eyes.
- How'd you know this?
- Magic.
I never would've thought you had it in ya.
Actually, everybody knows it.
It's Plato.
It's a corruption, of course, but Plato nonetheless.
Well, my grammy told it to me.
She must be well-read.
Blind since birth.
I've never met anyone quite like you, Mrs. Lemke.
You ought to get out more.
And you can call me Marina.
Marina... It's pretty.
It's pretty.
Look, Marina.
Fooling yourself into believing you married Leo... because your grammy screwed up Plato, that's... that's dangerous territory.
Well, I appreciate your concern, Doctor... but I wouldn't expect a man like you to understand.
Oh, no, I do understand.
And I want you to understand, because your impulsive behavior... is jeopardizing your marriage.
- Perhaps Leo just showed up...
- He didn't just show up.
How the hell you think he got to Ocracoke in the first place?
- I suggested he take a vacation.
- It was his destiny.
Mrs. Lemke, these delusions are not healthy.
- I can help...
- You know what? You don't know zip... about love or life, Doctor... and I don't need you strewing your learning all over me.
Do not walk away from this!
These fantasies...
Your fantasies of being all-seeing and all-powerful are dangerous... and they're...
It's just a hell of a way to run your life!
My God, you didn't dream
Leo into your life...
Of course I did.
I just made a mistake.
It's all right.
It's okay. That's...
Awareness is the first and most difficult step.
Honestly, I...
I understand what it's like to think you know everything.
It's really terrible.
I've made a wreck... of Leo's life and my life and two innocent strangers.
I've really got to go figure this out... and... fix it.
You ended up skating in the park with a patient.
It's classic countertransference.
You allowed her to manipulate you into a vulnerable... never mind unprofessional... situation... where she controlled you.
This is freshman psychology, Alex.
Oh, good. Oh, good. Good.
Dr. Tremor... don't blow a great career on a cute piece of ass.
You keep your dick in your pants... your id in check... and you remember that we have a mission... in this world.
Did you sleep well?
I didn't hear you come in last night.
I didn't want to wake you.
Lend me a hand with this?
It's stuck.
Are you trying to tell me something?
No.
You trying to tell me something?
No.
Say it with flowers?
For the first time...
I can almost imagine a world without therapy.
Amen.
Well, I'm glad our time together is having such a positive effect.
It's been good, but I owe this one to that psychic.
I thought we dealt with that.
Don't worry. It's not like
I'm cured or anything.
Good.
Well, not good...
Forgive me, Doctor, for I have sinned.
But he is such a good man, and I think he really likes me.
Is he married?
Well, yes. But... his wife's not well... which, of course, fills me with guilt.
But she's making him miserable, so I rationalize... by figuring that...
I'm bringing some well-earned joy to his life.
You're disappointed, aren't you?
I'm curious.
Oh, no. You wouldn't be if you knew him.
I mean, this is it.
You always know when the right person walks into your life.
I always know when the wrong person walks in... and it doesn't feel that way at all, so...
I'm sure Leo's the one.
Leo?
That's his name... Leo.
I really think you'd like him.
- Here's your hot dogs.
- No, no, sweetheart. Chops.
- Chops.
- Chops.
Great sign.
Really makes you want to come in here.
- Oh. It's you.
- Hi.
I didn't know you worked here.
- How'd that dress work out?
- Great.
Everything's working out great.
Thanks to you, I'm singing at this cabaret. Dellago's?
Oh, I know that place.
My husband likes it.
Okay, it's a bar.
But I met this really wonderful man.
Hey, maybe you can tell me if we're going to...
Oh, no. Never mind.
I don't want to know.
Just pray for me.
Pray for all of us, darling.
Would it be all right if I put up a flyer?
Well, sure. I'd be proud.
I've got to tell Leo to get up there to see you.
He just loves that old stuff.
Leo?
My husband.
That'll be 10.
Well, see ya.
Uh, 10.
I've got to find a wife for my husband.
Why not?
Thanks.
Out of my way, asshole.
Guess.
Would you fancy meeting a cuddly middle-aged man?
Sorry. I like them young and talented.
I never go on dates arranged by my butcher... but I'd be interested in meeting the artist who did your window.
Is he young?
Take my card.
Your change.
What I wouldn't give for just a little breeze.
Not till September at the earliest.
So now you're doing the weather?
The face of God is a one-way mirror.
You're not listening to me!
I knew it!
You're absolutely correct, and I apologize.
Excuse me.
You're still not listening to me.
- Leo.
- You're in. Good.
What the hell did you do to my wife?
- I am with a patient.
- Your fruitcake can wait. Mine can't.
You got her trying to fix me up with strange women.
I don't know what kind of advice you're giving out... but a few more visits with you, we can book her a room in Bellevue!
Wait a second!
I am not...
Just stay the hell away from her, okay?
You're a dangerous man.
- Your clock's stuck.
- I don't want to talk about it!
Where's Alex?
He's seeing some lunatic.
Doctor's wife is not one of my featured roles.
God, Grace, what am I going to do?
- What?
- I proposed to him the other night.
- No.
- Yes.
I can't believe it either, but I met the most incredible woman.
She just opened my eyes.
Me too.
Oh, yeah?
You're seeing someone new?
No. This new girl that works at the butcher shop.
My God. Marina.
She's incredible.
- Is she for real?
- Absolutely.
- What did she tell you?
- To stick close to my front porch.
That's why I canceled my weekend with you guys... to wait for my mystery date.
Hey.
You think I'm nuts?
Grace, that's fabulous.
Alex thinks I'm insane.
It's his favorite diagnosis.
Why do we waste our time with men?
Not all of us do.
Oh, Chauncey, don't touch me there.
Mrs. Lemke.
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.
I need to see you.
- Oh, well...
- Now.
Why don't we just go to my office?
Okay.
I was going to talk to you in the morning.
We need to...
We need to be clear about last night.
I acted inappropriately.
I never should have seen you under duress.
That was unprofessional.
I never should have allowed the session to leave the office.
- That was inexcusable.
- Doctor...
Worst of all, I had no business offering you... a quick-fix analysis of your marriage.
Dr. Tremor,
I saw you in my dreams tonight.
Oh, sure.
That's not uncommon.
Dreams are important.
And you know... you can keep a little notebook by the bed... and just write them down if you're afraid of...
What was I doing?
Smiling.
Look, Mrs. Lemke...
Marina.
All right, listen.
I can't deny that I feel an attraction for you.
But don't worry.
I know what it is... and how to remedy the situation.
There's no cure. Last night, just for a moment, you knew it.
Love is the leap that won't be denied.
No, no.
This isn't love.
This is what we doctors like to call...
I'll think of it.
Countertransference!
You're not listening to me.
Yes, I am, and I understand exactly... why you're doing this.
You do?
Yes.
To get even.
What for?
Because you're angry at your husband for commencing an extramarital affair.
What?
Yes.
Leo's seeing another woman?
Yes.
I'm sorry.
I thought you knew.
Well, if he was, I would.
Who is she?
I'm sorry.
I can't tell you that.
I can't believe he's seeing another woman.
My God, we've only been married, what, three days?
Marina, last night, you yourself said you'd made a mistake.
Yes, but it was my mistake... and I was doing the fixing.
And I'm gonna be the one deciding who my husband should marry.
Honey, we got to talk.
I heard you yesterday, you know, when you were talking.
So I suppose I've been wasting my time trying to find you the right wife.
Of course you are, honey.
I've got a good wife.
And we can work things out.
Don't worry.
- I may be simple, but I'm not stupid.
- What's that supposed to mean?
I suppose lying and cheating ain't in your vocabulary.
Another day, another dollar.
Eugene, I want that money back in the till.
What's a till?
You know I know. You want to borrow money, that's one thing.
- But I've got no time for thieving.
- Honey.
- What are you talking about?
- We're $50 short from last night.
Honey, is this what you're looking for?
Why don't you get a couch, Doc?
I need some advice.
You remember I was telling you about that girl I like?
Right.
She's got one of these "Sybil" things going now.
One day she treats me like I'm Romeo... the next day she treats me like I'm public enemy number one.
I can't figure it out.
The female psyche has eluded men since the beginning of time, Eugene.
Nice tone, Doc.
Feeling hostile?
Yes... No.
- We're not here to talk about me.
- That's right. It's my dime.
I'm thinking about my male pride with this girl.
Maybe I got to dump her.
Then I'm thinking, no... maybe I ought to give her another chance.
Maybe I got to go for broke, maybe even ask her out.
- So?
- So what if she says no?
Eugene, when confronted with a risky proposition...
Doc, 10 words or less.
I'm on the clock.
Love is the leap that won't be denied.
I was going to say that. Good thinking.
I'll get her to dump the butcher.
I assume when you say "the butcher," you're speaking metaphorically.
No, I'm talking about the old fart I work for.
Old Hannah Brown from 'cross town
Gets full of corn
and starts bringin' 'em down
Just at the break of day
You can hear old Hannah say
Give me a pigfoot
and a bottle of beer
Send me, I don't care
I feel just like I wanna clown
Bring the piano player a drink
Because he's bringin'me down
He's got a rhythm
Oh, yeah
When he stomps his feet
He sends me right off to sleep
Check all your razors and... 
So, Leo, what are you doing here?
I had to see you.
- I had to see you too.
- It's my wife.
- I know.
- She's looney tunes.
No, she's wonderful.
My wife?
- She's the one who got me singing.
- Marina?
So, the thing is...
The thing is...
You're grade "A," Stella, prime cut.
Together we're choice.
But my wife ain't got nobody but me... to see her through her time of trouble.
- We got to break it off, Leo.
- I can't just go abandoning her.
Are you women always one step ahead?
It's kind of spooky.
So... do you want this back?
Damn.
I just want to tell you
I'm real sorry for accusing you.
I just don't know what's the matter with me... and I hope you can forgive me.
I can.
I really loved the flowers.
And the window.
Really.
There was an art lady who came to the store today... and she really loved it too.
She said you should call her... and I think you should too...
'cause you've really got something special.
No, I don't.
No, a true gift.
I mean it.
He's such a good man, too, Doctor.
But I guess you were right, as usual.
If only his wife wasn't such a great lady.
But the thing is,
I know he loves me.
And I love him.
Such sweet sorrow.
God, love hurts!
Wait a second. You mean to tell me that Leo broke it off?
Maybe they're really not meant for each other.
Who?
Leo and Marina.
I never told you her name was Marina.
Of course you did.
No, I don't think so.
Sorry, then. My mistake.
No. That's her name.
I just... don't remember telling you that.
You two really love each other, right?
- Who?
- You and Leo, for God's sake.
- Gee, I think so.
- Yes or no? Stella, commit.
- Yes!
- Fine!
There. Now, if he's the right man for you... you can't let him slip by, can you?
Do you mind if I...
Can I?
But... he's married.
What about my addiction to failure in the form of married men?
Your addiction to failure stems from your failure to commit.
And your failure to commit stems from, of course... your lack of trust.
I'm a little confused.
You listen to me, Stella.
I am your psychiatrist.
You have got to commit to this affair once and for all... or you are doomed to fail.
And if you fail at this affair... you're gonna end up... a lonely, old spinster.
It's me, Stella.
I have to talk to you.
Hurry. Hurry.
Listen, Leo,
I'm no home-wrecker.
Well, actually, that's not true, but I don't want to wreck your home.
I like your wife too much.
But I love you.
Anyway, the thing is...
Dr. Tremor thinks that maybe we have a future together.
Who?
Dr. Tremor, my therapist.
Does it bother you that I'm in therapy?
Okay! All right!
Why, why, why are you fucking with my life?
I never laid a hand on her.
My life, my life!
First you start... by telling my wife to get me a girlfriend.
Then you tell my girlfriend... that we should have an affair.
Meanwhile my wife finds out about my girlfriend... only it's no go for her... because she didn't handpick her!
And now she's giving me looks with the meat cleaver!
What did I ever do to you?
It's a very confusing world, Leo.
I'd be lying to tell you otherwise.
What's the problem?
Ten words or less.
Jesus Christ! I'm trying to hold on to my marriage here.
Did it ever occur to you that your wife might want you to leave her?
Did it ever occur to you that your wife... might have found someone else?
My wife ain't having an affair.
- You never know.
- I know. I know.
You know why?
'Cause if she was...
I'd cut off his balls with a carving knife.
I apologize for the interruption.
Where were we?
What's on your mind, Doctor?
You can trust me.
I am having a professional breakdown.
I have done something... unforgivable.
Alex, you've got to stop thinking of yourself... as responsible for the fate of the world.
You're just a psychiatrist... trying to muddle through this twisted web of life.
You're obviously experiencing a stress-induced anxiety...
You know her too, don't you?
Know who?
The butcher's wife!
Okay, okay.
Goodness gracious.
I'm glad you're here.
I have so many things to tell you.
This has to stop now.
My practice is in chaos.
My patients are out of control because you are a psychiatrist's nightmare.
No. You don't understand.
I figured it all out...
I take chaos and turn it into order.
You take order and turn it into a chaos... that transcends chaos.
Why? I'll tell you why.
Because you are contagious.
That's why.
Everyone you touch just goes berserk.
You're the only one
I see jumping around... like a crazed jackrabbit.
Alex Tremor, you love me.
No! No, no, no!
Stop fighting it so hard.
Stop fighting it.
We're meant. It's destiny.
Why are you being so stubborn?
I am just a doctor.
All I've wanted to do since I was six years old is help people.
Me too.
- No. It's not the same.
- Oh, it is.
We both help people, just in our different ways.
Just when it comes to our true feelings and desires, we're just... too close to see clearly.
Marina... please, no more fairy tales, all right?
Can't you see how dangerous you are?
You say that listening to your heart and trusting what you feel... is that what you're calling dangerous?
You know what?
I hope I am contagious...
'cause life isn't about your damn books and theories.
You know what? Life is life.
And it's messy... and it's complicated and it takes guts.
That's not something you're gonna find in any book.
And just because you don't understand it doesn't mean it's crazy.
No wonder everybody's wandering around lost on this island.
They can't even smell the tides.
Here we go again... the tides, the tides.
Can't you for once deal with the problem at hand... instead of hiding behind all this hoodoo voodoo...
Yes, I can. You know what?
You get out now.
Out of my way, asshole!
Just ignore him.
Honey, what are you doing?
I'm leaving.
- Where are you gonna go?
- Home.
I'm real sorry, Leo, for all the mess.
I really thought we were meant for each other.
Yeah.
Me too.
And you've been nothing but sweet to me.
I just wanted... so much to find somebody to love... and be loved by that...
I guess I just jumped into that boat so fast without thinking it through.
I wouldn't have had it any other way.
Gracie, the sky is falling.
It's 2:00 in the morning, Alex.
Go home.
I know. I need to talk.
Yes, we do need to talk, Alex.
But you know what you need now?
You need sleep.
Yeah. Can I stay here tonight?
I don't want to be alone.
It's not a convenient time for me, Alex.
What? What?
I'm with somebody.
Gracie, that's... that's great.
- You may not think it's so great.
- Is everything all right, Gracie?
You've got Robyn in there.
I know that.
My career is a shambles... and my best friend is sleeping with my girlfriend.
Ain't love grand?
That's not gonna cut it.
We're happy.
Don't take it apart.
So...
I was the one who got her that nightgown.
- Call me tomorrow.
- Me too.
Gone is the romance
That was so divine
'Tis broken
And cannot be mended
You must go your way
And I must go mine
And now that our love dreams
Have ended
What'll I do
When you
Are far away
And I am blue
What'll I do
What'll I do
When I am wondering who
Is kissing you
What'll I do
What'll I do with just
A photograph
To tell my troubles to
When I'm alone
With only dreams of you
Dreams that won't come true
What'll I do
When I'm alone
With only dreams of you
Dreams that won't come true
What'll I do
What will
I do
Grammy d'Arbo.
Yes.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
I always wanted her to marry a doctor.
She's waiting on the lookout.
And I never read Plato.
Oh, it's a lonely world without your split-apart.
I've always had a hard time with mysteries... and I've never been very good with trust, but Marina...
I believe in you... and I love you.
Here in 2007,
18 years after the fall of Communism...
the promise of Eastern Europe is a faded dream.
Constant violence and civil strife have torn the countries apart...
plunging them into a hellish existence.
The very fabric of civilised society has come apart...
as government mismanagement, pollution, and widespread crime...
have caused a total economic and moral collapse.
ADRENALIN:
Fear The Rush
The failure of governments has caused ethnic conflicts to erupt.
These internal struggles continue to destroy what little there is...
of their nations' infrastructure.
Entire towns have been blown off the face of the earth.
The conflicts have escalated to the point...
where now thousands die in the fighting each week.
Cold, ruthless evil seems to have invaded every soul...
as each side is intent on annihilating the other.
Anarchy is destroying what little is ieft.
No electricity, no power.
Each city has been turned into a world of ruins and decay.
With such a total breakdown of government control...
food shortages have appeared everywhere.
Starvatlon and disease grow rampant.
Mass panic has caused riots to rage out of control.
Neighbour has turned against neighbour as they struggle to survive.
It was a death sentence for these inmates...
who were later locked away in cpecial government contamination centres...
after their efforts failed.
Many escaped, insane and violent, into society...
causing an unprecedented wave of mass killings.
No one saw it coming.
We were all looking out for big things:
a nuclear accident, another Chernobyl.
As the Russian republics split apart, no one knew who was responsible for what.
While they were trying to figure it out, something leaked, something small.
It rolled through Eastern Europe, moving west like a giant wave of death.
They called it virulent microphage.
Stay focused. Any sign of the inmate?
No, nothing.
-Anyone see anything outside?
- It's clear out here.
One of the patients is pointing.
Something is up ahead.
I can see the inmate area.
I see one of our guys down.
- Did you get that?
- Cut out for a second.
I said, I see one of our guys down.
He's dead.
There is no sign of the killer.
An officer got slashed.
The killer is armed with a knife.
- You guys see anything yet?
- Nothing.
I'm going into the inmate ward.
Shit!
We got a lot of bodies here.
They're everywhere.
All slashed, all stabbed.
The son of a bitch cut everyone up.
Doctors, nurses, patients...
Looks like he got out of his cuffs.
The doctor must have freed the bastard to treat him.
I think we got something here.
What do you have?
-By the stairs!
-By the stairs!
We see him. Ground unit in pursuit.
- Run!
- We're on our way.
Boston
2007 A.D.
When the United States saw the potential for the disease on its home shores...
it put the recent immigrants into quarantine camps.
My husband, Martin, was one of those immigrants.
So we interned wlth the rest of the masses.
It was only supposed to be for a few months...
but by the time Martin was killed, our baby was a young boy...
and the camp had become a city.
Give us back our rights!
Stop them!
Get back! Out of the way!
Shoot on sight. You understand?
Trust yourselves.
There were two worlds: the sick and the healthy.
No one wants in, and no one gets out.
Hey, man.
Take it down the alley, would you?
Don't you got no fucking manners?
Hey, man!
You better check it out.
Shit.
Help!
- How much time is there?
- A little over six hours.
Then what?
Our subject becomes a blood bomb, and everything he touches turns to shit.
And if that virus goes hot... everyone he touches will piss blood and shit out their guts.
So what do you say we just do our job?
- Sir, we've got a location. E sector.
- Let's move.
No one gets in, and no one gets out.
Unless you have a passport.
And they're almost impossible to get.
There are only two ways to get them.
One way is to go into a government service...
try to stay clean and healthy and earn your way out.
The other is the black market.
But unlawful possession is punishable by death.
Mummy, I don't feel good.
- I know, honey.
- My bones hurt, Mummy.
I know, but Mummy's got a special surprise for you.
It's going to take you to a special place and make you feel strong.
Will Daddy be there?
No, honey.
Are you going to come with me?
No. It's special, just for you.
Come home now, Mummy.
Soon, baby. As soon as I can, okay?
As soon as I finish here, I'll be righ home.
Now, you get some sleep. I'll see you soon.
- I love you.
- Bye.
You are at bat, rookie.
Captain Rennard's office, ASAP.
- I didn't do anything!
- Book her. Come on.
'DISTINGUISHED SERVICE'
Delon.
Come here, Delon.
He wasn't human. He was a monster!
- You got to kill him!
- Okay.
Calm down. Just try and calm down.
You believe me! You believe me, don't you?
You got to get him.
But you better bring in a fucking army.
Thank you.
So I want you two to go out there and bring me the perps.
- Is that clear?
- Clear.
Now would be a good time.
Spacemen and monsters.
You got your ray gun, rookie?
Would somebody get this piece of shit out of my office? Thank you.
- There it is.
- Video went down.
- Turn right.
- Confirm.
- Here?
- Turn right at the corner.
I just don't get it.
How do they expect us to do our jobs?
They don't support us.
They don't give us shit to work with.
Not even give us any food.
How do they expect us to live?
Let's just do our job, all right?
Is this the right place? I don't see any cops.
- This is it.
- I don't hear any screaming.
- What's that?
- Screaming.
The dispatcher heard a cop screaming before his radio went dead.
That's right. Thanks.
Movement, there on the second floor.
Let's go.
- What are you doing?
- Here?
Grab this. If anything happens, call for backup, okay?
Okay.
Okay?
Now go.
Don't be a hero, rookie.
Over here.
Volker?
Shit!
Mayday. Officer down. Need assistance.
Mayday. Come on, answer me, you motherfucker.
State your position and condition.
Metro Unit 1216.
Officer Volker is dead, the others, too.
Is your position secure?
How the fuck should I know?
Just get me some backup here.
Can you maintain your current position?
I'm down to my last clip.
I have 12 rounds left.
- Get me some backup.
- How many suspects?
One.
The other officers are down inside.
You can have their weapons.
Stand by.
Stand by for what?
Give me some fucking backup here!
We'll do the best we can, but we've got riots all over the damn place.
All available units are tied up.
There's also a problem in the State Hospital. There was a--
Hello?
Come in.
Hello? Shit. Hello?
Radio's dead.
Come on. The officer is a rookie.
Three months on duty.
D-Unit, take the call.
This is Unit 7. We'll do it.
What's a little more OT?
What do you think? It's quiet, huh?
A little too quiet.
Weird shit happens in this sector.
I don't like this part of the city.
You don't have to like it.
You just gotta do it.
Nothing's moving.
Let's move in.
Go.
Hold it!
Sit down. Okay.
Situation?
The bastard's inside. He's gonna come out.
Who's coming out? The suspect?
- It's a fucking monster.
- Calm down.
You fucking calm down.
You weren't just in there.
Is he armed?
I don't know.
My partner's up there.
The other unit. Their weapons are in there.
- Did you get him?
- Who?
- You used a clip. Did you get him?
- I don't know.
He's fast. Sneaky.
Is your partner still alive?
- No.
- What about the others?
- Have you heard them?
- They're all dead.
- The thing tore them up.
- Tore them up?
- He cut off my partner's fucking head.
- We're going in.
- Fuck this.
- Suspect's still inside. We are going in.
- I'm not going in there.
- Yes, you are. That's an order.
Fuck you.
They owe me three weeks back pay.
- I'm not dying for--
- One of us is in there!
- You are going in.
- So what? He's dead.
He's had his fucking head torn off.
I feel sorry for the poor bastard... but me going in isn't going make him feel better.
I'll go in there with you. He's my partner.
You sure?
Let's so.
Upstairs there's a room. He's inside.
You two stay down here.
- I've got a bad feeling about this.
- Shut up.
I'm scared enough without your fucking insecurities.
He's gone!
He can't be! He didn't get by me.
Don't you fucking move!
Look out!
- You're okay?
- Yeah.
Check Wocek. She got hit.
Down the stairs.
- You okay?
- Yeah. Down there.
Call for backup!
Faster!
Piece of shit! Gome on, let's go.
- Go.
- Cuzo, God, that hurts.
He's in the vent!
Lose him?
Fuck this! Let's secure this area and send someone back for assistance.
- This guy could kill someone else.
- Kill? Eat someone else.
Did you see what the son of a bitch did?
He eats people.
- I know fucking food is scarce--
- How are we set for torches?
Mine's dead. Any extra batteries?
- I know this place.
- We'll use one torch at a time.
You think anybody gives a shit if we catch this guy?
Why do we have to be heroes?
This leads to an old prison.
There are dungeons below us.
Yeah, the good old days, huh?
There's only one way in.
If he goes into the prison, we have him trapped.
- Don't we have him trapped now?
- No, the vent leads to the prison complex.
Either he goes into the prison or he comes out the other side of this building.
How do you want to play it?
How are we going to do this?
The guy is gone.
You and I go in the vent.
You two go around and block the other way out.
Maybe we can trap him between us. Go.
I can't believe you're making us do this.
Take your vest off.
Take it off. Come on!
Fake passport.
You can get into a lot of trouble for those.
It's the only way out of here.
There's no hope.
All the good people are leaving.
- That's why there's no hope.
- What?
Let's go. Get your torch.
I've got one team down, another team missing.
I had a man sitting in that chair just this morning... screaming about monsters and spacemen.
And now I look up and I see a real live Army Colonel... and a goon from some agency... wondering about what's going on in Sector E.
Look, Captain.
I appreciate your feelings.
I'm sure we both do.
The man we're looking for is infected with a new virulent form of malaria.
Extremely violent tendencies...
Does ripping off your head fall into the category of violent tendencies?
Captain, we're going to need to work together on this one.
Now, I need you to tell your men not to touch the suspect.
The disease is spread by bodily fluids.
Are you following me so far?
Gentlemen, he's all yours.
I will find their positions and you can have him.
Thanks for your help.
Malaria? Do you really think he believes that?
- I don't care what he believes.
- We need more men on this.
Why are we cutting out the cops?
In two hours, our carrier becomes contagious.
Tomorrow 5000 people are either dead or psychotic.
I don't even want to think about the next day.
We put information like that out on the cop network... we got our boys in blue packing up their wives and kiddies... and hauling ass out of here, starting a bona fide panic.
We don't want that.
We're going to work on this one ourselves.
No cops, right?
Right?
- This way.
- This country is getting so weird.
It had to be cannibalism, right?
That shit's been happening more with all the shortages.
It's getting fucking desperate for some people. 
The entrance to the prison must be down here.
The government has got to get more food.
People are starving and going crazy.
Are you serious? This guy is a maniac.
- He did not kill them for food.
- The fucker had the shit in his mouth.
You saw the bodies. He cut off the head.
- He did not eat that.
- Maybe he was saving it for dessert.
You think this guy is a fucking gourmet?
- Why do you think he did it?
- Because he's a sick fuck, that is why.
Perfect! We're going after some sick fuck who's probably got a gun.
We'll blow the bastard away, then we'll be done.
So shut up, all right?
If they got more food out, shit like this wouldn't be happening.
People need to eat.
And they got to pay our back salarlies if they want us to go after the sick fucks.
You will do your job and you will do it right.
I am not getting killed because some asshole didn't back me up.
- Do you get my meaning?
- Relax, will you?
I'm on your side.
Fuck me.
This tunnel looks clear.
Nice touch.
What is it?
Nothing.
There ie a piece of metal here.
Use your torch.
Got it.
And tell me if you see anything.
- Whaf?
- I wasn't talking to you.
We got a junction coming up, so be ready.
We got a junction coming up!
I can't tell which way he went, so be ready!
How did he do that?
He went in three different directions.
I don't know.
Take this one.
Call out if you find anything.
Don't take any chances.
I need you to do it.
I don't think he's down there, but we have to check it out.
All right.
What the hell was that?
Come on.
God! Motherfucker!
Stay there!
- He's got a gun.
- Are you okay?
Flashlight.
Quiet.
Down in there.
You okay?
Couldn't be better.
- I'm coming down.
- No, stay there.
He might double back and trap both of us down here.
Close call.
Really.
Flashlight.
Hold this.
- What is it?
- We've reached the prison.
Flashlight.
Okay.
Climb on down, slowly.
Keep your feet on the back wall and you'll be okay.
- That's it.
- Yeah, I got it.
Don't shoot!
You guys.
- Did you see him?
- Who?
Who do you think?
He must have gone by you.
We didn't see anyone.
We heard the shot and got here maybe 10,  15 seconds later.
Then we heard you in the vent.
We thought you were the suspect.
He must have gone by you.
- Did he get you?
- Yeah.
One sure thing, that son of a bitch has got a gun.
No shit.
No one got by us.
Fuck. The other door.
That means he's in there!
- Motherfucker is in jail!
- There is no other way out.
We have him trapped.
- What do you mean?
- This was once a prison.
- It's too easy.
- Man.
What is your problem?
My problem is we got to confirm his capture.
He's right.
Do I have your support in this?
We have to be sure.
It's our job, isn't it?
Stand back!
Don't fucking do this!
Flashlight.
- He's over there!
- Get up.
Delon, get out of there!
Get down.
Motherfucker!
You're going to go in and get that son of a bitch!
He can't get out. We've got him trapped.
- We know that.
- You have to make sure!
Are you insane? Nobody's going in there.
No fucking way. We've done enough here.
Look at your fucking knee! Look!
He doesn't know where he is.
He knows exactly where he is! Exactly!
Son of a bitch.
There can't be another way out.
Come on! You keep on saying that there is no other way out!
How do you know? How?
Somebody's got to go get some help!
All right?
- Okay.
- All right.
Maybe he should call for help.
Yeah. I could go for help.
Good fucking idea, rookie.
- Your ammo.
- What?
Leave it here.
- It's all right.
- Calm down.
Relax. You're spooked.
Get your fucking shit together.
Who's there?
Wocek, is that you?
Fuck!
Come on, son-of-a-bltch piece of shit!
Fuck.
Shit!
Help!
Help! He's here!
What did he say?
Cuzo?
He screamed.
Maybe he tripped or something.
Maybe there's another way out and the fucking maniac got him.
Shut up. There is no other way out.
You're going to have to go after him.
See if he's okay.
- You can do it.
- Cover me.
Cover me!
You son of a bitch. Answer me!
Help!
Don't let him lock us in!
- Fuck. Shit!
- The vent.
The vent!
You've got to find a way to keep it open.
Shit!
How long before he goes off?
Sir, we have a witness who may have seen where the carrier went.
- Is that the lady, soldier?
- Yes, sir.
Which way did you see him go, ma'am?
She's German, sir. No English.
Get me someone who can speak to this woman.
- What do we do? He got out!
- He could not.
- Yes. he did!
- Calm down.
Stop telling me to calm down!
We're fucked here, all right?
We will be if you don't calm down.
So shut the fuck up!
- How is she?
- Bad.
- What do you want me to do?
- Find a way out.
If we stay here, we'll die.
No one's going to find us.
That whiny bastard went to get help.
The killer got him. You heard the scream.
- Maybe he got away.
- We can't risk it.
- You got to find a way out.
- How?
- Where do I look?
- Over there.
If he got out, so can you.
How does he know so much?
I was asking myself exactly the same question.
He knows about police procedure.
He knows about the prison. Maybe he was...
- a cop or a guard--
- Or a fucking prisoner.
You think that's why he's doing this to us? Revenge?
He planned this whole things?
Maybe not at first, but now.
Lie down.
Lie down. Come on.
You son of a bitch!
Fuck.
Shoot the motherfucker! Shoot!
Are you okay?
We need you to be okay.
Keep it together.
Come on.
Go for help, through the cell block.
- I don't want to die.
- You won't die. We won't die.
Hang in there.
Go for help. Go.
Shit!
Fuck.
Leave them alone, you son of a bitch!
It's all right, Officer. We're here to help you.
- Where is your team?
- Who the hell are you?
Where's the carrier? Is he alive?
Contamination suits?
- What have you done to us?
- Listen to me.
We've got 40 minutes to get in before that guy goes hot.
We've got to find your team.
Do you understand that?
Officer, are you all right? Look at me.
We're losing time.
We've got to go back in. Can you do this?
Team A, let's move.
Go!
If he's not contagious, why are you guys wearing those suits?
Protocol.
What is if?
Spread out. The carrier's in the area.
Be ready.
He's close, people.
Look out!
Officer.
You're it.
You got to get this guy while there's still time.
Listen... if he lives, everyone else dies.
Do you understand me?
If I don't come back... you make sure that gets to my son and he gets somewhere safe.
You hear me?
I hear you, Officer.
- Officer Delon.
- Delon.
Shit.
Shit.
Fuck.
Son of a bitch! No!
Cuzo.
Please.
Don't kill me.
I want to live.
Please.
Oh,  shit!
Son of a bitch!
Leave her alone!
Come on!
Don't.
No, don't!
Please!
Don't!
No!
Kick!
Brace your feet against the pipe.
Give your hands some slack.
I better get my fucking back pay for this.
What took you so long?
I got the son of a bitch.
He's dead.
I can't see him. Where is he?
He's right... there.
Get those flamethrowers in here, now!
Out of the way! Coming through.
Officer Delon.
Easy.
- That'll do, Corpsman. Go on, beat it.
- Yes, sir.
You know the penalty for this.
Sergeant!
Take this woman, get her son... and escort them across the border.
Come with me, ma'am.
The End
PILOT: Good sleep?
NORMAN: Not bad.
NORMAN:
So where are we?
Where you from?
San Diego.
Left yesterday.
So you came Honolulu-Guam-Pago-here?
Long trip.
What do you do?
I'm a psychologist.
Hey, a shrink.
They've called in everything else.
How do you mean?
We've ferried people out of Guam for the last 2 days.
Physicists, biologists, mathematicians, you name it.
Everybody being flown to the middle of nowhere in the Pacific Ocean.
What's going on?
They're not telling us anything, sir.
What did they tell you?
There was a plane crash.
Do you get called in on crashes?
I'm on a list of psychologists the FAA brings in when a plane goes down.
NORMAN:
So where exactly are we now?
That's where we're headed.
Over there.
PILOT:
Here.
Take a look.
NORMAN:
What is that?
NORMAN:
Wow.
All that for a plane crash?
I never mentioned a plane crash.
- Any other gear? Watch your step.
NORMAN: I'd like to call my family.
SEAMAN: We'll get you settled in first, then send for you.
NORMAN: I'd like to get started.
SEAMAN: We'll send for you.
NORMAN: It's critical I see them...
SEAMAN: Who?
NORMAN: The survivors. If I don't get to them in the first 24 hours...
SEAMAN: What survivors?
NORMAN: Survivors of the plane crash.
SEAMAN:
Plane crash?
NORMAN: I deal in post-traumatic stress and survival guilt.
Maybe I should talk to someone who knows what's going on here.
SEAMAN: Talk to the ship's psychiatrist.
NORMAN: I'm a psychologist.
NORMAN:
That's why I was sent here.
TED:
I told you people I need a phone.
Discuss that with Mr. Barnes.
TED: That's fine. Give me a phone,
I'll call him. Norman?
Why are you here?
Take your hands off me, please.
Do you have any idea who I am?
Tell him the name of the book you wrote.
Astrophysics You Can Use. It was a
Book-of-the-Month Club Main Selection.
Never heard of it.
You really thought he read your book.
You haven't changed.
It was written for the layman.
He's not impressed.
TED:
Is there a phone in here?
NORMAN: I've been trying to call...
TED: Would you stop touching me?
NORMAN:
Wait a minute.
Beth?
(CREWMAN OVER SPEAKER)
All units make your flight quarters...
... condition one stations for landing.
Stay clear of the fantail...
Goodman, you been here long?
NORMAN: I've been here 3 hours.
BARNES: Welcome aboard.
This thing scares the hell out of me.
NORMAN: It's already too late.
You might as well helicopter me back...
...because the damage is done to the survivors already.
BARNES: Hold on. We'll get to that.
NORMAN: I don't know who you are.
BARNES: I know who you are.
NORMAN: Who are you? Navy?
Military? What are you?
You ever hear of the OSSA?
They don't know who I am.
That should reassure you.
BARNES:
You haven't talked to anyone about this?
NORMAN: I talked to the pilot.
BARNES: What'd you tell him?
I told him I was here to see the plane crash. That's my job.
BARNES:
Plane crash. Good.
There was no plane crash.
Spacecraft.
A spacecraft.
I guess that explains a lot.
NORMAN: NASA?
BARNES: That doesn't surprise you?
At least it explains the secrecy.
The secrecy's critical, Norman.
You made that explicit in your report.
What report?
ULF.
I wrote that for the Bush administration.
And that's our bible here.
But that was a report about a possible encounter with an alien being.
You want to come with me?
Oh, boy.
BARNES:
About 3 weeks ago...
...a ship laying fiber-optic cable between Honolulu and Sydney...
...hit an obstruction
1,000 feet underwater.
Cut this cable here clean as a shears.
The Navy got interested, sent out a search ship.
It turned out that what did it...
...was this.
We took this with side-looking sonar.
This is an aerodynamic fin longer than a football field...
...bigger than any known wingspan.
This is the fuselage.
This is ultrahigh-res SLS bottom scan.
Came in a week ago.
There it is, buried under about 8 yards of coral.
Something's wrong with that measurement.
Pacific coral grows an inch a year.
You can set your watch by it.
That's right.
So you're saying this spacecraft crashed in the year...
So you're saying this spacecraft crashed
300 years ago?
BETH:
That's impossible.
It's not impossible if this spacecraft came from an alien civilization.
TED:
Wait a minute.
You think this is an alien spacecraft?
It's not impossible.
It's ridiculous.
We think there's an Unknown Life Form on the spacecraft. That's why you're here.
You are the contact team that was recommended in the Goodman Report.
We have a biochemist...
...to assess the physiology of the Unknown Life Form.
A mathematician, because that'll probably be our common language.
And we have an astrophysicist to locate its place in the cosmos.
HARRY: Led by a psychologist.
BARNES: Right.
Nowadays, the little green men say,
"Take me to your therapist"?
BARNES:
Listen up.
"Contact teams meeting an Unknown Life Form or ULF...
...must be prepared for severe psychological impact.
Stress reaction of confronting such life has not been sufficiently studied...
...and cannot be entirely predicted in advance.
But the most likely consequence of contact is...
...absolute terror. "
That's from Norman's report.
TED: Are these parameters correct?
BARNES: Yup.
You're saying that you have a spacecraft over a half a mile long...
...that crashed into the ocean 300 years ago and it's completely intact?
That's right.
And the kicker is, our sonar is picking up a low-level hum.
Something's still running inside.
There's no way this coral could've grown faster than an inch a year?
BETH: No.
- That's what we're going there to see.
What?
Who says?
TED:
Harry, that's a joke, right?
This is the greatest scientific discovery since Copernicus. Bigger!
The idea that we're not alone, it'll change everything.
Evidence of extraterrestrial life.
You don't want to see that?
I got to say that I resent this briefing very much.
And how's that?
If Norman's report calls for a biologist, a mathematician...
...an astrophysicist and a psychologist...
...why are you here?
Physical protocols start in half an hour.
MEDIC:
You always wear glasses?
I just started wearing these.
Are the glasses a problem?
I don't actually need them.
They're just for reading.
And they're more of a crutch.
I see fine without them.
But they didn't anticipate
I'd be going 1,000 feet under the water.
MEDIC:
Do you take prescription medication?
No.
MEDIC:
None at all?
Once in a while sometimes I might take like a...
...piece of Xanax or something if I'm nervous.
Something like that.
But not...
...much.
Knee surgery. Complete reconstruction of ACL, right knee.
Still have steel pin here, steel pin here, little medial collateral damage.
MEDIC:
I see that you have a scar on your neck.
Car accident.
MEDIC: Were you drinking?
BETH: Yeah.
But I wasn't driving.
NORMAN: Wait, I just want to apologize for putting your name on the list.
HARRY:
Why?
When I made the report a few years ago,
I picked names of people I knew.
HARRY:
And?
I know Ted because of his father.
- Yeah, so what?
- Beth was a patient.
It's a bogus report.
What? Did you tell Barnes?
You can't do that.
That's fraud.
They came to me, new administration, right? Political agenda.
They said, in case of an alien invasion, do's and don'ts.
Why didn't you just say no?
NORMAN: It paid the down payment on my house.
New administration wanted to prove they're doing something new.
How'd you come up with this team...
...of a biologist, an astrophysicist and a mathematician?
Right.
HARRY: How?
NORMAN: I don't know.
It sounded good, right?
Made them come to me.
I forgive you, Norman.
I forgive you!
But I don't forgive you for Ted.
He's a pain in the ass.
I'll talk to him.
We'll be there 2 hours.
You don't have to be around him.
He idolizes you anyways, but
I'll talk to him. I'll buy you dinner.
NORMAN: I'm sorry.
HARRY: Your secret's safe with me.
NORMAN: I can't believe this thing could... Like a dream.
NORMAN: Have you called your wife?
HARRY: No.
NORMAN:
Why not?
INSTRUCTOR:
This'll be a saturation dive.
You'll be going to a habitat in 1,000 feet of water.
A sub will take you to the Habitat and you'll transfer aboard.
At 1,000 feet, your body will be pressurized for that depth.
You could actually take a quick dip.
The pressure wouldn't bother you.
Although I wouldn't recommend it because the water's so cold...
...you'd freeze to death in less than 2 minutes.
That's the reason for the diving suits.
Your helmet has a rebreather for your air supply.
Following this briefing,
I'll take you to an onboard dive tank.
For the next 8 hours...
...you'll train in deep-saturation dive techniques and emergency procedures.
Once you've gone down 1,000 feet...
...if you surface, you'll have to commit to several days of decompression.
There is no real quick return.
However, there is a mini-sub...
...that may be used as an emergency escape vehicle.
But there must be a ship at the surface to mate to for decompression.
Without decompression, your body would literally burst.
Under these circumstances, you're very well-controlled.
The dive has been planned well and professionally monitored.
The descent will take about 13 minutes, descending at 80 feet a minute.
BARNES:
It's going to get chilly.
Try to relax.
Next time, just tell us when you're going to push the button.
HARRY:
Mozart...
...Horn Concerto in E-flat...
...K- 447.
How you holding up, Captain Nautical?
TED: I'm loose.
HARRY: You're loose?
I'm loose. I'm loose.
I'm uptight.
NORMAN: We okay?
BARNES: We're in the river now.
What river?
BARNES: It's a temperature/salinity differential.
It flows like a river inside the ocean.
- Under the ocean there's a river.
BARNES: That's right.
You okay?
Right now, I'm not okay.
Would you please not touch me?
We're both nervous. Yes?
Would you cut that out, please?
NORMAN: You're having a stress reaction.
That's Harry's stress reaction.
Those noises we're hearing, that's normal?
Those noises are the water pressure attacking the sub's integrity.
You know a little something about that, don't you, Norman?
How the pressure can attack your integrity.
Come on, you be nice this trip.
Were you nice last time?
TED:
You two want to sit together?
My God!
TED:
Norman, look at this, look at this.
NORMAN:
Jesus! That's just the fin?
That's the Habitat.
BARNES: The Navy moved it in sections and set it up as a base...
... as soon as the spaceship was discovered.
It's manned by 2 naval personnel.
It will be your home-away-from-home while we investigate the spacecraft.
TED:
It ain't the Motel 6.
(OFFICER OVER SPEAKER)
Approaching docking bay from R-4.
FLETCHER: All personnel, descent sub one, engaging lock area.
You are now depressurized.
We're going to pressurize you now.
It's hot in there, but you're going to feel coolness. That's the helium.
NORMAN: Helium?
TED: Was I the only one listening?
Oxygen is a corrosive gas, in the same family as fluorine and chlorine...
...hydrochloric acid, hydrofluoric acid.
That's why we're breathing helium.
Because oxygen at any level higher than 2.3 becomes toxic.
Can you run that by me again, Ted?
I don't speak balloon.
TED:
What?
That's my voice. The helium resonates differently with my vocal chords.
"Follow the yellow brick road. "
BARNES:
Kiddies, cut it out.
The voice regulators are behind you.
Put them on.
BARNES: The Navy dive team is setting up a hydraulic robot...
...in the air lock outside the spacecraft.
We'll use that to open its door.
Is that the door?
BARNES: Yeah, we used sonar imaging to pinpoint it before the divers went down.
TED: How tall is that robot?
FLETCHER: Five feet.
And it's roughly the same size as an airplane door, isn't it?
BARNES: Excuse me, Ted.
TED: I think that's worth taking note of.
Excuse me. Tell them our team is in place and ready, okay?
FLETCHER:
This is Habitat to Navy dive.
Has it occurred to anyone maybe we shouldn't open that door?
NORMAN:
Why do you say that?
HARRY:
We assume they'll be green...
...or insect-like, but basically human.
But what if they inhale air and exhale cyanide gas? It's plausible.
Or live forever, like a virus or a yeast.
But why would you assume that a ULF would want to kill us?
An immortal creature wouldn't think killing was right or wrong.
It'd have no concept of it.
Instant eradication. It's what all the serious scientific stuff talks about.
What little there is on the subject.
You did put that in your report?
It's in there.
Get us the ETD for team's departure to surface.
Tell them we're in ready and thank them.
FLETCHER: Habitat to Navy Dive.
Our team's ready to take over.
Descent sub ready for your return to surface.
Thanks for all your help.
We'll let you know what we find.
I'm not too thrilled at the prospect of this.
What if you have to go to the bathroom?
Just go down your leg, Ted.
TED:
Really?
You can urinate in these?
You can.
The question is, do you want to?
NORMAN:
Where's the switch?
BETH:
Okay, let's go.
BARNES:
All right, Fletcher...
...we're at 1,022 feet.
The ambient temperature,
34 degrees.
Heading out north-northwest...
It's a firm bottom.
Intermittent coral.
This is great, you guys.
TED:
Look at the size of that thing!
BETH:
My God!
You see that tunnel?
BARNES:
That's where we're going.
BARNES:
Into the heart of darkness.
BARNES: We're in the coral pipe now,
Fletcher, approaching the air lock.
NORMAN: I'm feeling pressure in my ears.
Is that normal?
BETH:
Just use your equalizer.
NORMAN:
A little better.
BETH: The most toxic creatures on Earth live down here.
The venom of the land animal is nothing by comparison.
BETH: Even the weakest sea snake is invariably lethal.
NORMAN: Is that supposed to make me feel good, Beth?
BARNES:
This is our air lock.
BARNES: It'll take us from a wet to a dry environment.
BARNES: We're assuming the inside of the ship is sealed.
NORMAN:
This thing is enormous.
(BARNES OVER SPEAKER)
That's not budging, is it?
BARNES: Turn it at 45 degrees.
FLETCHER: What's happening here?
Is that piston broken?
Can you get the suction cup flat to the plane of the door?
BARNES:
Maybe it's the hydraulics.
The pressure messes everything up at this depth.
Time for a demonstration in basic physics, gentlemen.
NORMAN:
What is it, Harry?
Take a look.
HARRY:
It's chipped.
All right, it's chipped.
So what?
I thought you said this thing wasn't damaged when it crashed...
...that this titanium alloy was so super-strong, you can't hurt it.
I did.
So why does it chip when this scientist just bangs it with a hammer?
Is there heat coming off this thing?
You're right. Get out of there.
Back up.
BETH:
Just a minute.
I mean, get back now!
Get back.
NORMAN:
Jesus.
Anybody else wonder who the hell opened that door?
NORMAN:
How did that happen?
BARNES: I'm not sure about the atmosphere. Helmets stay on.
BETH:
All right.
TED:
We come in peace.
TED:
Always wanted to say that.
BARNES: Fletcher, inform the Navy we've gained access...
... to the spacecraft.
There's a hell of a lot of radiation shielding in here.
BARNES:
Huge grids of catwalks and plumbing...
...and a lot of steam.
It's endless.
We'll stay in touch here.
BETH: Somebody's been here.
HARRY: What?
BETH:
There's footsteps and they ain't ours.
HARRY: So what do you say, Norman?
Time to turn back?
NORMAN:
I'm a little curious.
BARNES: Break up into 2 squads. We'll never cover the territory otherwise.
Split up?
He's got a point. We've only got about a half-hour of breathing time left.
BARNES: Ted and Harry, you come with me.
Beth, Norman, stick together.
Come on.
HARRY: The people who built this place would call that "divide and conquer. "
NORMAN: Whoever built this thing wanted us dead, we'd be dead already.
NORMAN: These guys offer a grant to study the effects of an alien invasion.
NORMAN:
I told all this to Harry.
BETH:
You made up the report?
No, not all of it. I mean,
I did research on half of it.
Who did the other half?
I borrowed from, you know, good writers.
Isaac Asimov, Rod Serling...
Rod Serling?
Who would've thought anyone even reads those government reports. You know?
I show up here, half the Pacific fleet is here.
NORMAN: I just didn't know what to do.
I wanted to tell you, that's all.
Is this in the same category as,
"Beth, I thought you knew I was married"?
NORMAN: I don't think we have enough oxygen...
BETH: Oh, my God.
NORMAN: Did you push something?
BETH:
No. It did it on its own.
NORMAN:
That must be the cockpit.
NORMAN:
Hold on.
BARNES: Look at this.
Cross-stress bracing on the outer hulls.
All axes supported.
Look at this stuff.
This is interesting.
Soft and strong at the same time.
It's, like, better than rubber, better than steel.
HARRY:
You know a lot about this stuff.
BARNES: I studied aeronautical engineering at M.I.T.
Isn't that where you got your Ph.D.?
TED:
It's where I got mine. All 3 of them.
I hated M.I.T.
Envy?
Puberty.
How old?
First Ph.D., 18.
Damn.
One year, Harry.
You beat me by one year.
BARNES:
Let's push on.
BARNES:
Let's go.
TED: Man, they didn't tell you how heavy these things were out of the water.
TED:
Look at this.
TED:
Come here.
BARNES:
"Trash. "
"Basura. "
BARNES:
Trash?
NORMAN:
Oh, God.
BETH:
Jesus!
BETH:
It's human.
You mean humanoid.
No, Norman, I mean human.
BETH:
Blunt force trauma.
BETH: You can see by the direction that the fracture runs...
...that he was hit in the back of the head.
NORMAN:
What's in his hand?
BETH:
I don't know.
BETH:
What is it?
NORMAN:
"Smokehouse Almonds"?
My God, it's an American spaceship.
NORMAN:
It can't be an American spaceship.
It's 300 years old. There weren't even Americans, let alone spaceships.
BETH:
It can't be, but it is.
Let's see if there's some kind of flight recorder or data computer...
...where we can ring up some kind...
...of a flight history.
I mean...
BETH:
Wow.
BETH: Look at this. It's in English.
Come here.
BETH:
Okay, good.
Right there.
And there.
NORMAN:
Look at the dates!
NORMAN:
Can't be.
BETH:
Could be.
BETH:
It could be 2043 or 1643.
I don't know which one is weirder.
NORMAN:
"Unknown Entry Event. " Press it.
BETH:
You sure?
BARNES:
This is Barnes, Norman.
NORMAN:
Yeah, I can hear you.
I can't explain it, but I think we're inside an American spaceship.
It gets better.
NORMAN:
What the hell is it?
BARNES: Whatever it is, it seems to be what this bird was designed to do.
Go out into space and gather things like this up and bring it back.
TED:
Yeah, but back from where?
HARRY:
Don't get too excited, Ted.
Turn this thing over, it'll probably say "Made in Korea. "
TED:
Somehow I doubt that.
BARNES:
No doors.
No hinges of any kind.
TED: I'll bet if you put a micrometer on this, it'd be a perfect sphere.
Perfect to a thousandth of an inch.
That's a message in and of itself.
HARRY: Really?
BARNES: What do you mean?
TED: When Pope Benedict asked Giotto to prove his worth as an artist...
...Giotto drew a perfect circle...
...freehand.
Perfection.
It's a powerful message.
BETH:
I know what the Zen masters would say.
HARRY:
What's that?
BETH:
"This ball wants to be caught. "
BARNES: Nobody built this thing looking into their third eye.
They went to a lot of trouble and they didn't do it for nothing.
Something put this thing out there to get picked up and brought back here.
Have you forgotten the Trojan horse?
It could be a trap.
TED: Don't you think that's a little paranoid?
No, I'm going to put a video camera on this thing and keep an eye on it.
NORMAN: Can I ask you something about this reflective surface?
Yeah, it appears to be mercury, doesn't it?
Except mercury's liquid at this temperature.
NORMAN:
That's not what I'm talking about.
What worries me is that it's reflecting everything but us.
NORMAN: I hate to be the one non-scientist that picks this up, guys.
You know what I mean?
NORMAN:
What do you think it is?
I don't know.
BARNES:
Whatever it is...
...it's alien.
TED: Okay, an American spacecraft, materials, technology...
...more advanced than what we know, crashes into the ocean.
HARRY:
Why wasn't it damaged?
The materials are obviously super-strong.
If that's true, why did it chip when you hit it?
Okay.
Better:
It didn't crash.
It arrived...
...300 years ago.
BETH: From where?
TED: Not "where. " When.
So you're saying this thing took a wrong turn?
That's right.
I mean, what if the craft...
...inadvertently flew into a black hole?
It arrived in our past from its present.
The dates in the flight record...
That has to be 2043, 2047.
The image you saw, what you described...
...sounds like a black hole, a tear in the space...
HARRY:
We know what a black hole is.
I don't know.
It's a collapsed star with so much gravity it's like a vacuum cleaner...
...sucking everything into it, light, interstellar dust, time...
NORMAN: Time?
HARRY: It's possible, but not plausible.
It's more than probable.
It's rudimentary astrophysics.
We just haven't been able to fly into one and prove it.
BARNES: I just got off the horn topside.
They're expecting a bad blow up there.
And they're pulling us out.
TED: Pulling us out? Wait a minute!
What do you mean?
HARRY: What part of "pull out" don't you understand?
Extraction.
We're leaving.
That's ridiculous. We haven't even begun to scratch the surface here.
If you've ever seen a Pacific cyclone, what we call a tornado is a little fart.
So I suggest you go back to the dormitory and take a nap.
You need to lower your metabolism before we start the decompression.
You're leaving a time-traveling spacecraft at the bottom of the ocean?
I'm just following my orders.
We're the aliens' Welcome Wagons.
But, no aliens.
BETH: It was made in America.
TED: What's your point?
My point is, I'm a biochemist and there's no life down here.
What is wrong with you?!
That doesn't mean there's nothing to learn, to explore!
BARNES:
She's right.
You guys are the human contact team for an Unknown Life Form.
There is no Unknown Life Form, so we pull out at 0900.
TED: Please say something to him.
NORMAN: What?
I don't know. Do you not have an opinion about this?
NORMAN: I'm delighted we're going back up top.
You know what I mean?
This may look like a roadside diner, but in the meantime...
...my ears won't pop and if I pull this thing away from my neck...
...I sound like someone's squeezing my testicles. Let's go home.
HARRY:
Barnes is wrong, you know.
NORMAN:
You mean, wrong about the storm?
No, about the Sphere.
NORMAN:
What about the Sphere?
It's alive.
Why do you say that?
There's something inside it.
How can there be anything inside it?
There's no door, no seams.
The Sphere chooses what it will and won't reflect.
Doesn't that seem like the actions of a conscious being to you?
Pop psychology. I think, for whatever it's worth, you're angry...
...towards our friend Ted in there...
...because he figured this out before you did.
You really think so?
I don't know. This is my first underwater session.
You're right.
Ted did figure it out first, didn't he?
Good shrinkage.
HARRY: We're all going to die down here, you know.
What?
NORMAN:
What?
HARRY:
You see, it's curious.
Ted did figure it out.
Time travel. And when we get back, we're going to tell everyone...
...how it's possible, how it's done, what the dangers are.
But why 50 years in the future, when the spacecraft encounters a black hole...
...does the computer call it an "Unknown Entry Event"?
Why don't they know?
If they don't know...
...it means we never told anyone.
And if we never told anyone...
...it means we never made it back.
Hence...
...we die down here.
Just as a matter of deductive logic, Norman.
HARRY: Damn, I wish I could get inside that Sphere.
NORMAN: What's wrong?
FLETCHER: Talk to Mr. Barnes.
NORMAN: Where is he?
FLETCHER: Video feed room.
NORMAN: Where is that? I don't know where the hell anything is.
NORMAN:
Where am I?
NORMAN:
Where?
NORMAN:
What's going on?
I don't know.
You tell me.
NORMAN: What the hell is he doing?
BARNES: I don't know.
Do you know what he's doing?
- I need to know what you know.
NORMAN: Nothing.
NORMAN: He wanted to go inside.
BARNES:
We are inside. You mean outside?
NORMAN: He said, "inside. "
BARNES: What? Inside the spacecraft?
I think inside the Sphere.
Holy shit!
My God.
NORMAN:
Did he go inside?
BARNES: I don't think so.
NORMAN: What the hell's going on?
NORMAN:
He didn't just disappear.
BARNES:
I think it's a glitch in the video.
Give me playback on that.
FLETCHER:
You'll have it in a minute.
You knew he was doing this and you said nothing.
BARNES: You didn't think!
NORMAN: I didn't think it possible.
Where are Beth and Ted?
I don't know. I woke up, I heard bells ringing and I started running...
(FLETCHER OVER SPEAKER)
I'm not getting an image on the sub.
BARNES: Impossible! I got a cable in my quarters!
They'll be here in 25 minutes or less!
FLETCHER: The only logical explanation is that the sub is still at the surface.
Is it also logically possible your sonar is messed up?!
Let's just calm down, all right?
He didn't just disappear.
We are not going to leave him.
You got that right. I am not going to lose a civilian on my watch.
BARNES: You have just screwed up our trip to the surface.
We are not going up to the surface.
BARNES:
Harry! We are not going up!
BARNES:
Harry! Can you hear me?
BARNES:
Harry, can you hear me?
Norman, this is not a triage situation.
Norman?
BARNES:
Go find me Ted and Beth.
Norman.
BARNES:
Norman, stop.
Still no reading on the sub.
Forget the goddamn sonar, Teeny.
When Beth and Ted get here, make sure they don't go anywhere. All right?
NORMAN:
What the hell?
NORMAN:
Can you hear me?
Is he alive?
NORMAN: We have a problem.
Harry's out cold. His pulse is normal.
NORMAN:
All his vitals are normal...
...but I don't get it.
FLETCHER:
Hello. Hello!
Norman, can you hear me?
We lost video here. Can you hear me?
Norman?
BARNES: That tears it.
FLETCHER: What, sir?
We're on internal power.
I don't follow you.
BARNES: They cut us loose, Teeny.
For some reason the sub turned back.
Break out your 5-day deodorant pads.
We're here for the duration.
BETH:
Everything's normal.
TED:
What's going on? Is he all right?
TED: Is it true? Did he go inside?
What did he say?
TED:
He didn't say. He's aphasic.
He's asleep, Ted.
TED: I can't believe he went inside.
He didn't say anything?
TED: There's no door, no entry.
How did he get in?
(BARNES OVER SPEAKER)
Can I have your attention, please?
We've lost contact with the surface.
The Habitat is now operating solely under internal power.
We have plenty of food, oxygen and fresh water...
... to sustain us until the storm is over...
... and we reestablish contact with the surface.
But until that time, this mission is subject...
...to emergency authority under my command.
I'm taking this out to the mini-sub.
BARNES: Are you up on the duty roster?
FLETCHER: Yes, sir.
TED:
Where's she going?
It's procedures.
Everything in the Habitat is videoed.
Every 12 hours we take the videos to the mini-sub and press the reset button.
The idea is, if something happens to us and we don't reset it...
...the sub goes to the surface automatically.
If we're all dead, they at least have a partial record of what went wrong.
Cheerful thought, huh?
Mind the store a minute...
...I'm going to the head.
What the hell's that?
FLETCHER:
It's so beautiful down here.
It's so tranquil.
This is beautiful.
It's hard to believe we have a typhoon
1,000 feet above our heads.
FLETCHER:
Hey, it's snowing down here.
You see them?
There's got to be a million...
...jellyfish down here.
Man, this is really beautiful.
These jellyfish are getting a little friendly.
Having a hard time seeing.
FLETCHER: Hey, guys, you getting this?
It's getting thick down here.
Hello.
Hello.
(FLETCHER OVER SPEAKER)
I can't see what I'm doing.
Hello. Hello.
FLETCHER:
They're sticking to my faceplate.
Fletcher, this is Dr. Fielding. Just swim through them. They're harmless.
FLETCHER:
Guys, these jellyfish are everywhere.
Fletcher, get out of there.
TED:
What are jellyfish doing at 1,000 feet?
FLETCHER: I think they feel the heat from my body.
FLETCHER:
I can't get them off me!
They're stinging through my suit!
Get back to the Habitat on the double.
FLETCHER:
I can't move my legs!
Come back to the Habitat.
FLETCHER:
They're inside my suit!
Keep moving!
Just keep moving!
FLETCHER:
Help me!
TED: Jesus, Barnes, she's dead!
There's no bubbles.
BARNES:
Edmunds.
Yes, sir?
BARNES:
Come on down here.
Something...
... happened to Fletcher.
God!
NORMAN: When I was 5 years old
I went out on a boat with my father.
He told me not to jump in the water, so of course I did and...
Oh, my!
I jumped right into a school of these guys.
Not this big, though.
I think every one had a shot at me.
I don't know what this lady felt...
...but, man, it went beyond pain.
I've been...
...afraid of them since.
Would you feel any better if I told you this wasn't exactly a jellyfish?
You mean...?
I mean, jellyfish like this are unheard of.
I don't know what this is, but it isn't God's creation.
(HARRY SINGING)
Here I am Your special island
Come to me
Bali Ha 'i
BARNES:
You can come in.
NORMAN:
Hello?
Have a seat.
You want some coffee?
NORMAN: No, thanks.
BARNES: You know Dr. Halperin well?
I used to teach at UC San Diego years ago. She came for her master's.
Don't take it personally, but I assume she wasn't a romantic interest.
Don't take what personally?
She's a tall, vibrant, younger woman.
What's your point?
You knew her as a patient.
I'm not at liberty to discuss that.
You understand.
I understand an exotic-gas environment
1,000 feet under water...
...with no lifeline to the surface...
...is about the most dangerous environment on the planet.
If there's a problem,
I got to know about it.
- Beth is fine.
- "Beth is fine. "
BARNES: Beth's fine.
NORMAN: She's very fine.
Would you like to read this and tell me what it says?
- Are these my actual notes?
- What does it say?
NORMAN: How in the world did you get...
BARNES: Does it say "suicide attempt"?
BARNES: "Electroshock therapy"?
Isn't that what it says?
What's your point?
Didn't it seem important enough to tell somebody?
You were willing to jeopardize these people's lives...
...to have someone here who could be mentally unstable?
Are you aware of the term,
"overreact"?
We're 160 fathoms down.
And we've got a nutbag down here who can flip out and crack up.
BARNES: You selected the team.
Why didn't you tell me?
When I wrote this, I didn't know the team would be 1,000...
1,000 or 10, it makes no difference!
Why didn't you tell me about Beth?
It wasn't pertinent.
That was not your call to make!
Yes, it was and it still is.
It was a passive attempt.
A passive attempt?!
Those who really want to kill themselves shoot themselves or go over a bridge.
They don't call their boyfriend and say, "I took 20 Nembutal, help me. "
She took 20 yellows, and you're telling me she's perfect.
What is it?
Come in.
It's Harry.
What?
He's awake?
He's really awake.
Man, oh, man!
You're going to have a problem with me.
If my good buddy Norman keeps cooking like this, I ain't going nowhere.
This toast is good.
Bacon? Better.
But these eggs!
These eggs are fantastic!
Norman, what did you put in these eggs?
HARRY:
No, no, wait. Don't tell me.
HARRY:
Parsley...
...chives.
Tarragon and...
HARRY:
What is that?
Chervil?
Is that chervil?
Yes, it is.
I'm glad you like it, Harry.
I love eggs!
BETH:
They sure seem to cheer you up.
Do you remember what happened?
Yeah. I went inside.
How did you get inside?
There are no doors.
There are doors all over this place and we can't get out.
- We're still here.
- Yes, we are.
You didn't answer my question.
HARRY: Why are you looking at me like that?
BARNES: Harry, are you saying we shouldn't still be here?
Where's Teeny?
I thought she did all the cooking.
She had an unfortunate accident, Harry.
She was killed.
Killed? How?
Jellyfish.
HARRY:
Jellyfish?
That's strange.
Yes, it is strange, isn't it?
Here you go, Harry.
HARRY: Little onion rings. Look at that.
NORMAN: It's not onion rings.
Good, though.
NORMAN:
Guess what it is.
Calamari!
NORMAN:
You all right?
NORMAN:
Cough, cough, cough.
NORMAN: No, you're doing it wrong.
TED: I know what I'm doing.
TED:
Bring it up.
TED:
Come on, bring it up.
NORMAN: He's trying to say something.
He's trying to talk.
NORMAN: You don't listen.
He wants to say something!
HARRY: I'm not choking, you asshole!
NORMAN: See?
I hate squid.
I hate squid.
I'm sorry.
I was trying to help.
You okay?
NORMAN:
Harry, let me ask you something.
Before you went in the Sphere, you were convinced we would die here.
Yeah, I remember that.
You still believe it?
You afraid of dying, Norman?
TED: Bullshit!
He's hiding something and you know it.
TED: He went inside the Sphere and whatever it is he saw, he won't tell us.
- He said he doesn't remember anything.
- You bought that?
The whole food thing was all a diversion.
The guy's willing to put all of our lives on the line...
...because he doesn't want to share information.
I can see it. He's making notes for a book. He wants to win the Nobel Prize.
NORMAN: And you don't?
TED: No! Well...
Norman, you've known me since I was 17 years old.
I would love to be the guy who gets...
NORMAN:
Do you know how respected...
I'm not! I've written one
"Fun With Dick and Jane" book on physics.
I mean, Niels Bohr...
...he published "The Quantum Theory of Atomic Structure" at 28.
Einstein, relativity, 26.
Newton, gravity, 23.
In physics, if you haven't done it by 35, chances are you never will.
NORMAN: This doesn't have anything to do with your competitiveness with Harry?
19. Wunderkind!
I rest my case.
Mr. Barnes would like to see you.
Why?
Something's wrong with the computer system.
BARNES: Try purging it.
TED: I tried. It just keeps coming back.
BARNES:
Discharge from the buffer memory?
TED:
I ruled that out.
TED: The helium is getting to the chips.
It's probably a saturation effect.
BARNES: What are our options, then?
TED: You have to change all the chips.
BARNES: Forget it. Run this place on manual? It's going to be a long 4 days.
HARRY:
Hey, boss.
HARRY: Figured that out yet?
TED: It's a saturation effect.
I don't think so. If it's a saturation effect, it would be random.
What do you mean?
This has a pattern.
See? It's like a code.
BARNES:
A code from where?
How'd you do that?
How'd you see that?
HARRY:
Try binary.
See? Letter breaks.
You think this is coming from the Sphere?
Don't know.
This mission is ultra top-secret.
What you translate is for my eyes only.
If you were it, how would you know our alphabet?
Same way it's configured on a keyboard.
But reflected in an orb, spherically.
A keyboard, but spherical.
Take a keyboard...
...wrap it around a sphere...
...then starting at the center key, G, number the letters...
...spiraling out.
HARRY: You the man!
TED: I still got it.
TED:
I still got the juice.
Keyboard.
TED:
They let you keep those?
NORMAN:
Here, you want them?
All we got to do now is plug in the numbers.
Friends...
...in the 8,000 years of recorded history, this is a first.
HARRY: You're now on-line with an alien intelligence.
BARNES: You got to be kidding.
You must've messed up the translation.
I don't think so.
If this is right, this alien sounds like an idiot.
That's something to consider.
A stupid alien. They must have them.
HARRY: The message is childlike, but actually it's quite perfect.
It's short, to the point, non-threatening...
...kind of the way you talk to a small child or a dog.
TED:
Look at this.
BARNES:
He's making a speech.
BARNES:
Ask him for his last name.
What?
I want a full name for my report.
I'm not putting in my report I lost a crew member on a deep sat expedition...
...to find an alien named Jerry.
Please! "Jerry"?
TED: We ought to tell him that we're enjoying it too.
NORMAN:
Ask him where he's from.
TED:
Where are you from?
HARRY: "I make a journey. You make a journey. We make a journey together. "
BETH: I think Jerry's channeling
Deepak Chopra.
A journey from where?
TED:
He's happy.
He's crafty.
What happened?
HARRY:
Damn, I think we lost him.
We're not alone.
We are definitely...
...not alone.
It's trying to make contact with us.
Whatever it is, it was inside that Sphere. Now it's out, free to act.
What do you mean by that?
Free to take over our computers...
...call us on the phone, come knock on the door if it wants to.
A physical presence.
What are you thinking about?
That last part where he said,
"I am happy. "
Don't you want Jerry to be happy?
NORMAN:
Honestly?
What's on your mind?
I would be happy if Jerry had no emotions whatsoever.
Because the thing of it is, here's Jerry...
...an emotional being, cooped up for 300 years with no one to talk to...
...none of the socialization, the emotional growth...
...that comes from contact with other emotional beings...
So?
What happens if Jerry gets mad?
NORMAN:
What is that sound?
NORMAN:
Did you hear it?
You hear that thump?
What is that sound?
Can you hear me?
Did you hear that thump?
BARNES:
You are a hell of a woman.
I wish I knew you in the old days.
Norman told me you were...
BETH:
Norman told you what?
Let's put it this way, that if Jerry could read your mind...
...he'd be bored with ours.
NORMAN:
What is that sound?
Can you hear me?
(NORMAN OVER SPEAKER)
This is Norman.
NORMAN: I get no answer from Edmunds and there's strange noises.
NORMAN:
Barnes?
Norman? Beth?
(BARNES OVER SPEAKER) Edmunds must be up on the side of the Habitat.
I'm not getting anything on sonar, but watch yourselves out there.
Beth? Norman?
Would you hit your callback buttons, please?
BETH:
What'd you tell Barnes?
NORMAN:
About what?
About me, Norman.
BETH: You told him I took
20 Nembutal and tried to kill myself.
Didn't you?
NORMAN: He had my notes.
What do you want me to do?
BETH:
Did you tell him who I called?
NORMAN:
Oh, God.
BARNES:
Norman?
BARNES:
Come in.
Did you guys find that thumping yet?
NORMAN: I don't get it.
What could've done this to her?
My God!
She's like a rag doll.
BETH:
Her body's been completely pulverized.
NORMAN:
My God.
HARRY: "...tentacles 27 feet long.
That would make a formidable monster. "
NORMAN:
Let's go. Come on. What?
BETH:
What is that?
NORMAN:
What does this mean?
NORMAN:
Talk to me.
NORMAN:
What does this mean, Beth?
BETH:
There's something up there!
BARNES: Guys, I'm getting a reading on the sonar.
You're not alone out there.
BETH: What the hell makes eggs this size?! Come on! Jesus, let's go!
NORMAN:
All right!
BETH:
Norman, let's go. Come on. Let's go!
BETH:
What the hell is going on?
It's 80 yards and closing.
BARNES:
Get out of there.
BETH:
What the hell?
NORMAN:
What the hell is it?!
BETH:
Come on, Norman! Come on, let's go!
BARNES:
60 yards. How close are you?
NORMAN:
What is it?
NORMAN:
What the hell is it?!
40 yards. Move, move!
BETH: Come on. It's something big!
Let's go!
BETH:
Where is it? What is it?
20 yards! Move!
BARNES:
I need a report.
I don't know what's going on out there.
There are eggs everywhere.
BARNES:
You should've brought one back.
BETH: I wasn't up for an Easter egg hunt. Maybe Edmunds was doing that.
I want to talk to Jerry.
If we're going to talk to this thing, we got to have a game plan.
NORMAN:
Specific.
NORMAN: We have to have an objective.
We have to know what we're addressing.
NORMAN:
Jesus.
NORMAN:
Jerry?
NORMAN:
Can you hear me?
You've heard everything we've talked about.
That's great.
This is Ted here.
I'm the guy who decoded the keyboard thing that you...
Shut up!
Tell him we need to discuss this alone.
NORMAN:
Use your words.
He's mad.
NORMAN: Use your words.
BARNES: Let's just pull the plug.
It may not be that simple.
It's that easy. We leave him alone, he leaves us alone.
Maybe he doesn't want to be left alone.
He's been down here in isolation for 300 years.
NORMAN: Maybe Jerry's lonely.
BARNES: Lonely?
What's that?
BARNES: It's our sonar picking up something outside.
NORMAN: Jerry, we all think that you're a fascinating...
...and wonderful entity...
...and wish to talk to you for hours.
You know that, don't you?
NORMAN: In your great understanding and wisdom...
...you must know that entities such as ourselves...
...need to be private.
We have to talk alone sometime.
You know what it is?
Jerry?
Where'd he go?
Shit!
BARNES: Something's clogging everything up out there.
BETH:
It's back.
Positive thermals on the in-line perimeter.
What's that?
Something is hitting the sensor grid.
Do we have any defenses?
We can run a high-voltage current on the skin of the Habitat.
But every time we try it, we start an electrical fire.
Peripheral sensor's activated. I'll try to image it on the fast-acting sonar.
BARNES:
Building an image.
80 yards, closing fast.
Jesus Christ, it's 40 feet long.
BARNES:
50 yards.
Re-imaging.
BARNES: That's the same image I saw when you were looking for Edmunds.
It looks like a giant squid.
A squid the size of the entire Habitat?
There's no such animal.
BETH: That may be, but that doesn't mean it isn't here.
Re-imaging. 30 yards.
TED:
What the hell is going on?
Jerry, if you can hear me, it's Norman.
If we've made you angry...
We got a pressure drop.
BARNES: Ted, go to the control room!
TED: Why?
Just go, please!
BARNES:
Go! I'll tell you!
NORMAN:
What's that sound? What is that?
It sounds like it's right above us.
I know where it is, but what is it?
TED: I'm in the control shaft!
We got a leak in here!
Hello?!
Ted? Ted?
TED:
Holy shit!
Do you hear me?
Yeah!
You got to increase the positive air pressure and drive the water out.
TED: Increase the pressure?
Won't that use up our air supply?
If the Habitat is full of water, you'll be dead.
Open the red gate valve.
BARNES: The pressure is dropping! We'll be crushed like a tin can!
Find the red knob!
It's the only one in the room!
TED:
Got it!
BARNES:
Good.
We're getting positive pressure.
Not too much.
BARNES:
Start to ease it back.
BARNES:
Turn it back!
The pressure is too high!
BARNES:
We'll explode! Can you hear me?
Turn it back!
NORMAN:
We're here!
NORMAN:
Jesus!
Can you hear me?
BETH:
I got him!
Turn the red gate valve.
NORMAN:
Which way?
Clockwise.
Close it.
NORMAN:
Done!
Barnes!
We're still leaking!
It's not the shell.
It's the internal pipes.
We're okay.
BETH:
What the hell is out there?!
Norman. Listen to me.
Whatever it is, it's not letting go.
Pull the green lever marked
"high-voltage defense system. "
He said it would start a fire!
Don't do it!
BETH:
You said it would start a fire!
We're going to die down here.
Pull it.
NORMAN:
Barnes, do you hear her?
Don't listen to her. She's crazy.
Pull the green lever.
Pull the lever!
BETH: He's trying to pull something!
Don't do it!
NORMAN:
Do you hear her?!
Don't listen to her.
Pull the goddamn lever!
BETH: Don't do it.
It will we start a fire.
BARNES: Pull it!
BETH: It'll eat up all of our oxygen!
BETH:
Don't do it!
BARNES: We've got failures all over the place! We're taking on water!
BETH:
It'll set a fire! There's no way out!
NORMAN:
Shut up! What am I going to do?!
BARNES: You're going to be squid food!
Pull it!
NORMAN: What am I going to do?
We're falling apart!
NORMAN:
We're okay.
You don't have to be right all the time.
TED:
Anybody got some Advil?
We got a fire in the comm room.
Get up there. I'll meet you with gas masks, in case we need them.
NORMAN:
Extinguishers?!
BETH:
There's one there.
NORMAN:
I got it!
NORMAN: How do you work it?
TED: Pull the pin.
Are there any more?
BETH:
In the dorm.

Harry, wake up!
Shit!
(ALERT SYSTEM)

Alert, alert.

It's coming through the ceiling panels.
Try to get it through the cafeteria!
BETH:
Okay, I'm going up. Get back!
Don't, Jerry!
Don't.
You okay?
TED:
Hang on!
Get out!
Norman!
Get out!
This is Norman, Jerry.
Can you hear me?
It's Norman.
Is that you, Jerry?
NORMAN:
Who put out the fire?
Who put the fire out?
He's dead. Barnes is dead.
He got cut in half by the door.
Beth and I put him in a body bag.
I know. Something happened to Ted, Jerry.
I can't.
It's not in my power.
There was a fire and...
And I froze.
I didn't help him.
I wanted to, but I didn't help him.
I knew him since he was 17 years old, and I let him go.
But I'd like to just deal with this at a later time.
You made that, Jerry?
NORMAN:
No, that's all right.
Very important.
Nothing more right now. Please.
You have to stop.
Listen to me.
This is critical.
Your manifestations injure our entities.
And pretty soon there'll be no more entities left to play with...
...and you'll be all alone again...
...because you can't control yourself.
Because with all your power, you don't have the power to stop, do you?
What name do you want?
Jerry. What name do you want?
NORMAN:
Hi, Harry. How you doing?
NORMAN:
Can you believe what happened?
HARRY:
What?
NORMAN:
You know, the attack on the Habitat.
NORMAN: You know there was an attack on this place?
HARRY:
I must've slept through it.
NORMAN: You slept through it.
HARRY: I was dead tired.
Smoke didn't bother you?
NORMAN:
All the leaking?
You ever read this book,
Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea?
I found it in the john.
Someone's misguided attempt at levity.
I always loved this book.
Could never get past page 87 though.
Too scary.
You seem strangely detached, given our predicament.
I don't know, Norman.
With all your running around, what have you accomplished?
You knew I was running around?
Have you seen Beth?
No. Thought she's with the others.
What others?
Barnes and Ted are dead, Harry.
There's nobody left down here that knows how to run the place.
Right?
The fire screwed up the electronics.
We've used up...
...most of our reserve gas.
You're reading your book.
Somebody has to go reset the mini-sub.
If you don't reset it every 12 hours, it'll float to the surface.
HARRY:
I'll go.
NORMAN: I'll go.
HARRY: You sure?
BETH:
If the storm clears...
...it might be our only way out.
NORMAN:
Can I talk to you for a second?
I don't want Harry anywhere near that mini-sub.
Think he'll leave without us?
I think he already left without us.
Harry's in a whole other place.
He slept through the attack.
You don't find that a little strange?
I guess it's just you and me, babe.
You and me?
I'll keep my eye on you from the control room.
Reset.
Reset, where are you?
There you are.
NORMAN:
Beth?
Are there supposed to be bubbles...
...coming out of...
...out of here too?
I think I have bubbles coming out of my hose or something.
Beth?
Can you tell me what to do?
It's fogging me all up here.
There's something wrong here!
I got to get out of here!
Tell me what to do! What do I push?
Where the hell are you?
Help me.
I don't think I'll ever get back!
Tell me what to do!
I can't breathe!
HARRY:
Watch out for that rock.
It's me, Harry.
Come around the rock.
Go to the right of the stanchion.
NORMAN:
Tell me what to do. I'm hurting.
Come around which way?
I can't breathe!
Yes, you can breathe.
It's just a faulty valve.
It won't kill you. You got plenty of gas.
NORMAN:
I can't tell which way I'm going!
HARRY: See the air lock?
Right in front of you.
I can't bear the feeling in my ears!
NORMAN:
And I can't breathe.
NORMAN: Where is she?
HARRY: Slow your breathing.
HARRY: You'll hyperventilate.
- She said she'd keep an eye out.
HARRY: I looked all over the Habitat for her. I thought she was with you.
NORMAN:
Where is she?
Where is she?!
NORMAN:
Did she tell you she was going out?
NORMAN:
Beth?
BETH:
I can't hear you.
HARRY:
If she can't hear, why'd she answer?
What are you doing?
I went looking for food.
We're out of food.
I was just up there. Stuff all over, but there's plenty of food.
NORMAN: You went to look for food in the spacecraft. That seems a little odd.
No. What seems odd about it?
Even if there was food, wouldn't it be at least 300 years old?
I was hoping for a cryogenic freezer, you know?
Maybe a bottle of Bordeaux.
She's lying.
She's lying about everything.
BETH:
Is Harry up there with you?
Why don't we talk when you get back.
Meet me in the galley.
I'll buy you a cup of coffee.
There's still coffee, isn't there?
Very funny. I'll take mine black, like my mood.
NORMAN:
All right. See you soon.
We got 2 ingredients here:
Beth and this underwater environment.
Put them together, you got one big-ass bomb.
How did it go in the mini-sub?
It was a little disconcerting out there, actually.
Weren't you supposed to be watching out for me from the control room?
Yeah, but...
...Harry said he'd take over for me.
You sat down at the monitors.
What happened?
I was in trouble.
Where were you?
BETH: What's going on?
NORMAN: "What's going on?"
Going out to look for 300-year-old food in that spaceship...
...when there's plenty of food here isn't exactly normal.
"Plenty of food"?
There isn't any...
A veritable horn of plenty.
He must have hidden it.
You think I hid all that food?
I don't know what's going on.
I was standing right here.
BETH:
And there was no food in the cupboards.
And there was no food in the fridge.
Why?
Why would Harry do that?
Why would he set you up?
I don't know.
NORMAN:
You don't know?
I'm telling you...
...I was standing here...
...and this food was not here!
Calling Dr. Halperin. Dr. Beth
Halperin. Please return to reality.
Shut up.
You can see what he's doing to me.
NORMAN:
You said you'd watch me. You didn't.
You think Harry said something he didn't...
...that cupboards are empty when they're full.
Clinically, we would call that evidence of a psychotic break.
I am not crazy, Norman!
You going to write me a prescription?
And just get rid of me again?
It's not that convenient down here!
I am not psychotic!
How about a mini-psychotic break?
BETH: That's not fair.
NORMAN: Beth!
What?!
I'm down there. I can't breathe.
I'm hyperventilating. The man saved me.
NORMAN:
Wait a minute!
You want me to believe that he set you up! Why?
NORMAN:
This isn't Alice In Wonderland!
Remember, "just you and me, babe"?
NORMAN: Is it unrealistic to think that at this point...
...you are a danger to yourself, to all of us...
...because of your anger toward me, which happened 10 or 15 years ago...
...which is so distorted in your head!
NORMAN:
I was out there.
You almost got me killed!
NORMAN: The man tried to save my life!
You now want me to disbelieve Harry?!
Yes, I want you to disbelieve Harry!
I want you...
...to look at me and believe for one time.
Look at me.
Am I telling you the truth?
You weren't there.
You want to believe Harry, then that's fine.
Because he's done everything but part the sea for you since we've been here.
BETH:
But I'm telling you...
...that he is not...
...telling you the truth.
This is not about Harry.
NORMAN:
Is it?
NORMAN:
Who's this about?
He didn't tell you what's inside the Sphere, did he?
You didn't tell him what's inside the Sphere.
And how would you know that?
Did you go inside?
Answer me.
Did you go inside the Sphere?
Why won't you answer me?
NORMAN:
It's a question.
You don't want to talk to me.
Remember?
NORMAN:
Answer a question.
What do you think?
You think she went in the Sphere?
Here.
You dropped your book.
NORMAN:
What isn't Harry telling me?
I know you're there.
You're always there.
What's inside the Sphere?
Harry is reading this book...
... Twenty Thousand Leagues
Under the Sea.
What makes me nervous is that after page...
...it's all blank pages.
Why?
Why did he go into the Sphere...
...and come out like this?
Why?
Why?
Why, Jerry?
Why is this book half a book, Jerry?
Why? Why?
What's going on?
NORMAN:
He's got G equals one.
That's right.
He's got B equals two.
He's got...
...H equals three.
That's not right.
Harry's got the code wrong.
H doesn't equal three.
NORMAN: Harry not only makes it real for himself, Beth.
He makes it real for you.
He makes it real for me.
He has made it real for everybody.
It's really frightening because you don't know whether it's really real...
...or whether he's made it real for us to believe it's real.
And it's because of the Sphere.
BETH:
Our Harry is Jerry?
NORMAN: Come on, I'm just as tired as you are.
I know you can get this.
Okay?
Harry said he couldn't get past page 87 because he said it was too scary.
There's nothing on the pages.
Where's the rest?
Read what's on page 87.
"According to calculations of some naturalists...
...one of these animals, only 6 feet long, would have tentacles 27 feet long.
That would make a formidable monster. "
What does Harry hate?
Squid.
And when he read that, it scared him.
NORMAN:
Getting the picture?
Remember all those...
...jellyfish that attacked?
What was Harry doing then?
BETH:
Sleeping.
He was dreaming.
And this is the really wild part:
What he dreamed...
Happened?
It happened.
You're telling me that...
...because Harry went inside the Sphere, he now has the power to manifest...
...his dreams, his fantasies...
Manifest.
He manifested it.
He made it happen.
We better not piss him off.
It's not that different from a child, right?
A child imagines that what it's imagining happens.
But it doesn't.
But with Harry, it does.
In fact, it's so real, it's not only real to Harry, it's real to all of us.
And what I can't understand is that ever since he went in the Sphere...
...the Sphere has a power...
...that projects every subconscious thought Harry has onto the computer.
NORMAN: It prints it out and we interact with it.
We thought it was Jerry.
It's not Jerry. It's Harry.
Harry's Jerry.
Does Harry know this?
But you went in the Sphere and nothing happened.
Obviously, I didn't go in the Sphere.
You never went inside the Sphere?
You didn't go in there?
I was so angry at you.
I wanted you to be scared.
Maybe you had a right to be.
Thanks.
You sure you didn't go in there?
I don't know about you, but I don't feel like dying down here.
NORMAN: What we're going to do is find something to put Harry under.
We can put him in some kind of deep unconscious sleep.
BETH:
Dreamless sleep, I hope.
NORMAN:
A dreamless sleep, yes.
How do we do that?
BETH:
I got a bunch of drugs up there.
Fancy that.
NORMAN: "Diphenylpyraline. "
BETH: Burns.
NORMAN: "Ephedrine hydrochloride. "
BETH: Motion sickness.
NORMAN:
"Valdomet"?
BETH: Ulcers. You might want that.
NORMAN: "Sintag. "
BETH: Sintag is a synthetic opiate.
It's a painkiller.
I might want to keep that.
NORMAN: What about "parasolutrine"?
BETH: Really?
BETH: I got paracin trichloride.
That's an anesthetic.
NORMAN:
Do you combine it?
BETH: You give about 20 cc's of this one, 6 of this one.
You're in business.
NORMAN:
Here's some more paracin trichloride.
BETH: Good. We'll knock him out for about 3 to 6 hours.
NORMAN:
I'm going to hold him.
HARRY:
What's going on?
Go back to sleep.
BETH: I didn't know it would be that fast-acting.
We didn't kill him, did we?
BETH:
I don't think so.
NORMAN:
Okay.
BETH:
Come on, come on.
BETH:
Here we go.
It's a code.
How the hell are we supposed...
NORMAN:
It's decoding itself.
"Weather normal.
Surface support vessels return. "
6 hours and counting, we're out of here.
It's over.
If you trust it.
You know me,
I believe everything.
Get out!
Get off!
They're Belcher sea snakes, Norman.
The most poisonous snakes in the world.
BETH: But they're nocturnal.
They're only dangerous at night.
(BETH OVER SPEAKER) Norman, can you meet me at the lab, please?
I have something
I need to show you.
What are you doing?
I'm here.
NORMAN:
What are you doing?
Why are you locking me in?
Beth!
You manifested the snakes.
BETH: You're the only one who could be manifesting these snakes.
Turn around.
Turn around and look on the table.
BETH: See the hypodermic needle?
NORMAN: Yeah.
I want you to inject yourself.
What?
BETH:
It's the same thing...
...that we used to inject Harry.
We gave Harry this stuff because he was manifesting and we wanted to...
You're manifesting your fears...
...the jellyfish...
...now the snakes.
The squid thing was Harry, but he's asleep.
He's in a dreamless sleep. It couldn't be him. You are the only one left.
What would the snakes have to do with me? I didn't go in the Sphere.
BETH:
See the jars?
I put the snakes in there and they disappeared in front of my eyes.
Who's manifesting them, Norman?
You are.
I don't have anything to do with snakes.
If you don't use the hypodermic needle,
I'm going to have to defend myself.
I'd remember if I went in the Sphere!
Don't make me do this.
I don't want to do this.
I didn't manifest anything.
I didn't manifest the squid.
I didn't manifest the...
I shouldn't be talking to you like this.
Why are you taking the gas out of the room? That's my air.
NORMAN:
What's with this water?!
Think it through. Whose childhood fears were the jellyfish?
NORMAN: Jellyfish?
BETH: Remember, Norman?
NORMAN: I'm not the only one who's afraid of jellyfish.
This wasn't exactly a jellyfish.
Jellyfish like this are unheard of.
NORMAN:
Anybody can be...
...afraid of jellyfish.
A lot of people are afraid of them.
Isn't it possible that you went inside the Sphere...
...and you just don't remember?
I didn't go inside the Sphere!
You would've seen it on the video!
I didn't go inside the Sphere.
Yes, you did.
(BARNES OVER FLASHBACK)
Is he alive?
(BETH OVER SPEAKER)
You went inside the Sphere...
... and you just don't remember.
That's the problem.
It's not me!
I'm not going to use it!
Inject yourself with the hypodermic needle.
BETH:
It's your snakes. See?
It's all a fear.
It's just a fear.
BETH: You can make it go away.
Just use the hypodermic needle.
And the ships will come and we'll get out of here.
What are you doing?!
You're going to kill me!
You can stop it.
BETH:
Try to pull yourself together.
Your fears are going to kill all of us.
Please, don't open the hatch.
You'll freeze to death in the water.
BETH:
Norman, no!
You'll kill yourself!
Don't open the hatch!
BARNES: I know enough not to get killed down here.
Are you the most qualified in your field?
What exactly are your qualifications?
Why are you here?
Why are you here?
Why are you here?
Are you the most qualified?
NORMAN:
You almost got me killed.
You're a danger to all of us.
Come back to reality.
NORMAN:
Beth?
NORMAN:
What are you doing?
NORMAN:
Beth?
Beth?
Norman?
Are you real?
As real as the water that almost drowned me.
You tried to kill me.
What are you doing there?
Beth, you went into the Sphere.
Didn't you?
NORMAN:
Answer me.
I don't know what to think.
I feel like I can't breathe.
BETH:
I'm losing it, you know?
I'm trying to keep it together, but...
HARRY:
What's going on?
Why'd you put me out?
What are you guys up to?
NORMAN:
You went in the Sphere, Harry.
So did Beth.
So did I.
I think.
And if so, what?
NORMAN:
Everything that we feel or think...
...just...
...happens.
That's what happened to the astronauts.
NORMAN: The astronaut in the chair, what did you say about his head?
BETH:
He had...
...blunt force trauma.
He got hit in the head.
They went into the Sphere one by one...
...became afraid of each other, till they killed each other off.
And we're doing the same thing.
I don't want to kill you.
(ALERT SYSTEM)
Your attention, please.
All construction personnel must exit the blast area...
... immediately.
Panther explosives are now activated.
Mark 13 minutes and counting.
Want to tell me who that voice is?
They had explosives down here to blow up the coral.
So when I went out before, I set up a defense perimeter around the spaceship.
BETH:
Something must have triggered it.
What?
Something from inside the Sphere.
HARRY: Nothing in the Sphere, Beth.
NORMAN: Then what?
HARRY:
I don't know.
Then who?
It's me.
Oh, God.
I was just thinking about the explosives.
It just flashed inside my mind.
It must've triggered them.
I was thinking about wanting to die.
You put explosives near the spacecraft?
Yeah, I did.
But they're about 100 yards away.
HARRY: There's a lot of liquid hydrogen left on that spacecraft.
If it explodes, it'll disintegrate everything.
NORMAN:
Mini-sub, now! Let's go!
NORMAN:
I hope there's a ship up there.
(ALERT SYSTEM)
Your attention, please.
All construction personnel must exit the blast area immediately.
Panther explosives are now activated.

BETH:
Let's go! Let's go!
NORMAN:
Come on, come on!
NORMAN:
Come on, move!
NORMAN:
Keep moving.
BETH:
We're not going to make it!
BETH:
There's not enough time.
NORMAN:
Just keep moving.
NORMAN: We're not out of time.
We're not going to die here. Keep moving.
BETH:
Let's go, Norman.
NORMAN:
It's not like I drive subs, okay?
BETH:
You're driving one now.
NORMAN:
Oh, my God!
BETH:
What's going on?
NORMAN:
I don't know.
BETH:
Why are we inside the spaceship?
NORMAN:
I don't know.
NORMAN:
Let's go!
(ALERT SYSTEM)
Now alert. 5 minutes and counting.
NORMAN: We're not moving.
Anybody hit the button?
NORMAN:
What the hell?
NORMAN: Wait a minute.
This was an elevator before, right?
BETH:
Which one of us is doing this?
NORMAN:
Oh, God.
(ALERT SYSTEM)
Alert. Panther explosives armed.
NORMAN: Wait, wait.
We were here already!
NORMAN:
How much time we got?! Come on!
HARRY:
It's a dead end.
BETH:
Where are we?
HARRY:
An illusion.
BETH:
Doesn't look like it.
NORMAN: Beth, which way?
Harry, where do we go?
HARRY:
Where? Where's where, Norman?
Around that corner?
And what's there?
Just another blind alley in the maze of our minds. Illusion.
BETH:
Maybe he's right.
NORMAN:
We believe that, we're dead.
HARRY:
Just go on. Leave me.
NORMAN: You're not going to die down here. I'm not going to let you die.
NORMAN:
I'm not going to die.
You have to push the button.
I can't see a button.
NORMAN:
I can't see the button.
NORMAN:
I can't see the button.
HARRY:
It's no use.
HARRY:
We die down here.
BETH: We're running out of time.
They all look the same.
NORMAN: I don't know where we are or what we're stuck in.
HARRY: Where we are is stuck in the illusion that we can change the future.
HARRY:
It's a dead end.
Just like I said all along:
We die down here.
BETH:
Maybe he's right.
BETH:
Maybe he's right.
NORMAN:
I'm not going to die.
Beth's not going to die.
And you're not going to die.
Look, just leave me.
NORMAN: We're not in the spacecraft!
We're in the mini-sub! This isn't real!
NORMAN: This is your manifestation!
Let it go!
It's a dead end.
NORMAN:
We're not going to die here.
NORMAN:
It's not our time.
BETH:
Thank God, we're out of here.
Don't start celebrating yet.
Why not?
I don't think we're going fast enough.
NORMAN:
For what?
HARRY: An underwater blast creates a suction. It'll suck us into it.
That is, if the shock wave doesn't kill us first.
(ALERT SYSTEM)
Alert. Mark 20 seconds and counting.
Panther explosives are now activated.
HARRY:
640 feet.
610. You a religious man, Norman?
Atheist. But I'm flexible.
HARRY:
Pull up, Norman! Pull up!
HARRY:
Come on, pull up!
CREWMAN:
This is Escort 7.
We have sighted OSSA mini-sub, bearing 105.
Bearing 105.
Preparing to make contact for decompression procedure.
NORMAN:
What's going on?
More of nothing.
I want to thank you for saving my life.
NORMAN:
Interesting life to save.
BETH:
You get some sleep.
NORMAN: I have no idea what to tell them when they debrief us.
NORMAN:
My back is killing me.
NORMAN: Next time I have to stretch before I jettison from a mini-sub.
BETH: We've been trapped in here for about 3 days.
They want an explanation. We ought to figure out what we want to tell them.
Killer jellyfish, squid, sea snakes...
...and an alien being in the form of a giant totemic golden ball? Please.
BETH: We destroyed $ 100 million worth of equipment down there and people died.
They want answers.
What do you guys want to tell them?
NORMAN:
Harry?
Why aren't we dead?
What?
NORMAN:
You said...
"The future can't be changed. "
It can't.
But in the spaceship they called it an Unknown Entry Event.
NORMAN: Like we never got here alive to tell them about it.
You said we wouldn't survive. If you can't change the future, we'd be dead.
NORMAN:
We're alive. We're not dead.
And in 2 minutes we'll be in a room full of military guys.
They know about the Sphere.
We know Barnes got a hold of them before we lost contact to the surface.
What do you want to tell them?
Why bother?
The Sphere's destroyed.
But we still have the power, am I right?
I don't know if I trust them with it.
I don't know if I trust you.
I don't want to not be able to sleep, afraid I'll wake up...
...having manifested some nightmare...
...and there's all kinds of weird things in my apartment.
That's a frightening thought.
No kidding.
So...
...if we still have the power...
...what do you want to do with it?
God knows what they'll do with it.
Are you worried what will happen if it falls into the wrong hands?
Yeah. Frankly, I don't know what the wrong hands are.
Or what's worse:
The wrong hands or our hands.
We are the wrong hands.
We proved it.
You know, the 3 of us are enlightened people, we're intelligent...
...we even recycle our cans and bottles.
But when we got our shot, we manifested every mean...
...distorting, vengeful, paranoid thought you could think of.
NORMAN:
We did.
NORMAN:
Right?
You believe we still have the power.
Of course we still have it.
And that's the answer to the equation.
We can't change the future.
We're not dead.
But they don't know. Why?
I'm not following you.
Because we have the power...
...to forget.
To forget.
You want us to agree to forget?
Wait a minute, are we sure that we want to do this?
Yes.
This is the greatest discovery in the history of mankind.
We're just going to white it out like it's a typing error?
I'm sure.
What about you, Beth?
What's the matter, Norman?
It's a little hard to let go of.
Something that could've been...
...this gift?
The power to make your dreams come true.
NORMAN: We're given the greatest gift in the history of mankind.
We're given this magic ball.
And it says...
"Imagine what you will and you can have it. "
That's an extraordinary gift, but we're so primitive we...
We manifested the worst in us, because what we have inside us...
...is what we have inside of us, instead of the best of us. What does that say?
We weren't ready, Norman.
NORMAN:
We have what's called an imagination.
I mean, look what we're capable of.
We can...
We're not ready.
A long time ago...
...I did something very...
...very inappropriate with you, and I'm sorry.
NORMAN:
Okay?
Okay.
I don't have any answers, Norman, but these guys are coming so let's...
Okay, we're going to agree to forget...
...the Sphere...
...the power...
...all that ever was.
NORMAN: I don't know how to get this going. You're the mathematician.
How about we just count to 3?
I couldn't have come up with that.
I'll start.
One.
Two.
Three.
INSTRUCTOR: Can somebody tell me what the hell that's supposed to be?
Why are you holding my hand?
No, you were holding my hand.
What is your deal?
I got a big game on Friday.
Look, it's no good. I need my fluids.
Your fluids?
Yeah.
Mary Jo, I'm curious.
Why would you do something like that?
Why not?
It's self-mutilation, really.
Self-mutilate this, fluid boy.
Good find, girl.
Yeah.
Who's that?
Oh, shit. No.
Slut.
Andy.
You want to step out for a minute?
You kids shouldn't be out past curfew.
Andy Effkin, toast with the most.
You like our chances against Knight's Ridge?
We should do fine.
Thrown for a loss.
Is your arm okay for the game?
- It's good.
- Offensive line up to par?
Son of a bitch.
Fuck.
Easy, Eff. Easy, buddy.
- I need my fluids.
- Give me the gun.
Get out of here, now.
What?
You gotta be shittin' me.
That's Mary Jo.
Clarice, it's Cox.
We got a wet one here on the bluff.
I just can't wait, Steve.
To do what?
To see my new room, my new school, my new everything.
Yeah, new everything.
It's gonna be awesome.
It's gonna be better.
Way better.
Come on.
Looks like you're moving to Cradle Bay.
- We sure are.
- Sure you'll like it here.
- You'll never want to leave.
- You hear that?
Hey, you. I thought you were gonna help me.
Come on.
Fridge.
Thank you.
You all right?
Yeah.
Just trying to put some of this stuff away.
Nervous?
- About what?
- First day at school.
Dad?
What are you doing, dipshit?
Don't worry about snakes in the garden... when you got spiders in your bed.
"They had been so innocent and little there.
And all beyond was so unknown and great."
Very good, Trent.
To wit, when Pip says this...
Dickens is speaking of the joy of discovery... of newness, of change.
Mr. Clark, perhaps you can relate.
Mr. Clark is new to us from Chicago.
Do they read Dickens in Chicago?
Dickie Atkinson.
Welcome.
Tell us why you're late.
Trouble with the camshaft?
Like you know what one is.
Somebody woke up on the wrong side of the carburetor this morning.
Peckerhead.
What is... if I may display my ignorance... a peckerhead?
Why are you laughing, Whalen?
Nothing, Richard.
I was just thinking how ignorance kills.
- What does that mean?
- Exactly.
You ass-kissing little fuck!
Boys!
Perhaps yet another little sojourn to the principal will serve you well?
Want to know what a peckerhead is?
- That's a peckerhead.
- Thank you for the clarification.
Please send Principal Weathers our hosannas!
"Youth is wholly experimental."
Robert Louis Stevenson.
I know.
These seats taken?
No. Go ahead.
I am Gavin. This is U.V.
I'm Steve.
Munchies.
U.V. Has some primo weed.
We smoked a fatty during gym.
Check him out. He looks almost tan.
Hello, Lorna. How are you today, my dear?
- Drop dead.
- Contact.
- Who's that?
- That is Lorna "Love-itis" Longley.
Fire of my loins, purveyor of my every masturbatory fantasy.
The entire female gender is separated into two groups.
Lorna comprises one group.
All of womankind comprises the other.
You ever take her out?
Alas, Lorna is largely untouchable for someone of my social standing.
What do you mean?
It's a class system here at C.B. High, Stevie Boy.
Check it out.
There you got your motorheads, car jocks.
All the world's a gasket and a lube job and a pack of Luckys.
Music of choice: Posi-traction overdrive, classic rock...
Skynyrd, The Allmans, Bruce.
Drug of choice:
Beer, Miller Genuine Draft.
Keggers can't be choosers.
Freaks who fix leaks.
Over here you have your microgeeks... nerds, whiz kids and various other bottom feeders.
Music of choice:
The sound of an Apple PC booting up.
Drug of choice: Stephen Hawking's
"A Brief History of Time"... and a cup of jasmine tea on a Saturday night.
Freaks that go squeak.
Over there you have your skaters.
Riffin', ragin' kids and their ramp tramps.
Baggy pants, Dickie wools, doing 50-50 grinds... with a gnarly grab finish on a homemade halfpipe in the woods.
Music of choice:
The whack of a hacky sack.
Drug of choice: Ecstasy, E-tab.
Baby, longer lovin' through science.
Freaks in sneaks.
Here's where it gets really nasty.
Lorna runs with that group there, the Blue Ribbons.
- What's that?
- It's a community group of good kids.
Have bake sales, car washes.
- Kiss a lot of adult sphincter.
- Blue Robots.
Here, here.
Those three guys: Cradle Bay's answer to Manson, McVeigh and O.J.
Trent Whalen, Andy Effkin, Robby Stewart.
I bet you didn't know that toast came in three flavors.
This group's music of choice: The hum of perfection, the buzz of ambition.
Drug of choice:
Life, the pursuit of clean living... at the expense of all who sniffle at the hem of their gowns.
Freaks, so chic.
Then you got kids like me and U.V.
Lames who like our metal heavy, our Marlboros light.
Music of choice: Harvester of Sorrow,
Language of the Mad.
Drug of choice: What do you got?
Freaks all week.
That's it. Lesson over.
Class dismembered.
Welcome to Cradle Bay High, Stevie Boy.
Welcome to my nightmare.
- Why can't we help you with your math?
- Just leave me alone.
Hello.
Phlegm.
P-H-L-E-M-G-H. Phlegm.
- Wrong.
- Let me see that.
- What are you two doing?
- We're having a spelling bee.
My brother Allen was the best speller.
- I thought your name was Steve.
- It is.
Allen's my brother who died.
I have a grandfather who died.
Why don't we change the subject?
- Pass your plate.
- Why?
- You know why.
- Nathan.
Shannon, do you get yelled at if you talk about your dead grandfather?
Around here people go crazy if you talk about a dead brother.
Hello?
I'm here for the Mustang parts.
What the fuck?
What are you doing here?
The troops shall set you free.
What do you guys want?
Sweet Dickie, we want you.
We've got it for you, Richard.
We've got all the winning numbers.
We like to welcome all new students.
Standard procedure.
As soon as Dr. Caldicott arrives, we can begin.
Doctor?
He's the resident faculty fellow, an outstanding educator.
He's been with us two years now.
Works with the students in a counseling capacity.
I think you'll like him.
I'm sorry I'm late. Hi. Edgar Caldicott.
It's nice to finally meet you.
- Everything okay?
- Fine.
Have you given any thought to extracurricular activities or sports?
Not really.
- There's the Blue Ribbons.
- The Blue Ribbons?
Yeah. They help each other study and practice.
It's a team effort.
It's a motivational workshop, really.
The Blue Ribboners have truly been making the grade... and doing wonderful things on the playing field.
All of us here are aware of the tragedy back in Chicago.
- If there's anything we can do...
- I said everything's fine.
Steven, we know how tough it can be.
Whether or not you want to be involved with the school... we want to be involved with you.
- That's all the meeting is about.
- Okay.
So go make some new friends.
- Like that?
- What is it?
It's bona fide jitterbug.
It's my buddy, Rachel. Cook's Ridge trash.
She's a great chick, but she's Cook's Ridge trash.
Come on.
Dancing queen.
Rachel, this is Stevie Boy.
Good man.
This is Rachel. Cook's ridge trash.
Bite me.
Wow, appropriate sparks are flying.
Somebody cue the power ballad.
Fail to be a tumor, Gavin.
What do you say we cruise town, chase a case... hit the bluff and drink some beer?
Consecrate Stevie Boy's arrival to this new and pathetic tank town.
- You down?
- Sounds razor.
Stevie Boy?
Sure.
Excuse me, sir. Can you help me out?
- What?
- I'm trying to buy some beer.
I have the money and everything,
I'm just a month from...
Get off my case, kid.
You know, the problem with America... is mankind's abject unwillingness... to contribute to the delinquency of minors.
That was like the tenth guy.
- Chug.
- What are you doing?
- Chasing. Nobody's willing.
- Yeah?
Hello, Charles.
Cycle any anabolic goodies lately?
- You're funny, Strick.
- Thanks. I'm here all week.
A couple of us are going to the Yogurt
Shoppe later, if you want to come by.
The Yogurt Shoppe? Yeah.
You want to make an "active culture" joke here or should I handle this one?
- See you later.
- Bye.
- What?
- What?
You're actually flattered that barn door has a thing for you?
- Bullshit.
- Right.
There's for the syrup.
Is that the right one for the orange juice?
Where's the deodorant coupon?
It's here somewhere.
- What does a hooker say after 12 hours?
- What?
Clean up on aisle four.
Sorry.
Come here!
Easy.
Fuck! You Blue Ribbon shithead!
What was that all about?
Toxic Jock Syndrome.
- You'll be fine.
- Where's my shake?
What the hell would make a kid freak out like that?
It has to be steroids.
All those jocks are into it.
Kelly Connor saw Andy Effkin bite the head off a kitten in a fit of rage.
- No way.
- I'm serious.
I think it's bullshit, though.
It is not bullshit, and it's not steroids.
- Here we go.
- What?
Gavin thinks some sinister force is taking over the Cradle Bay meatheads.
- You know what it is.
- A sinister force?
You know, evil.
Nowhere to turn, no one to trust.
- Fail to be a bitch.
- Fail to be a pucker-ass.
- What?
- Nothing.
Let's go!
Andy killed her.
Everyone's saying she ran away.
I saw her dead body, but I can't prove it.
- Those fuckers.
- Why didn't you go to the police?
Cox was there, man.
The cop didn't do shit.
Fuck, nobody listens to me.
Cancer Corner.
Best place in the school to sneak a smoke.
What are you shitbirds doing down here?
- Relax, Mr. Newberry.
- You ain't supposed to be down here!
This is my friend, Steve.
He's new to the Bay.
Gnaw, gnaw, gnaw.
Drag marks.
Drag marks of a rat's tail.
What have you got there?
It's an "E-rat-icator."
Sounds are supposed to scare the rats away.
- You hear that?
- Yeah.
Scary, ain't it?
Piece of crap. Doesn't work worth spit!
A dollar for everything that didn't work worth spit.
Mr. Newberry has the Boo-Radley- village-idiot-Quasimodo thing going.
- Don't you?
- What?
And he's currently involved... in a war against the rodent population of Cradle Bay.
Gotta fight them!
Rats from the bay.
Incoming! You think you can run, but you can't hide!
- A day at the master races.
- Check that out.
Jesus.
Is that Dickie? What is he doing?
He's one of them now, bud.
He's a Blue Robot.
Watch and learn.
What the fuck?
They're peckerheads. Look at him.
He's killing his hard-on.
Fore!
Maybe he turned over a new leaf.
I would like to own the new leaf concession here in Cradle Bay.
Did you tell Steve about the murders?
Steve is a disbeliever.
The mysterious disappearance of Mary Jo
Copeland and Officer Kramer? Uh-huh.
This is where he accuses me of being paranoid.
"Denial" ain't just a river in Italy, bud.
Check your weed, boys.
- You are beige, boy.
- See you, Rachel.
Bye.
Here's your chocolate sundae.
Hope you guys...
Can I help you?
Steven, good to see you, brother.
Come sit down.
Steven, this is Kathy, Andy...
- Tom, Randi...
- Hi.
Lorna, Chug.
You know Robby and Dickie.
This is Steven. Sit down.
Steven's new to the Bay from Chicago.
- Do you like it here?
- Yeah, it's okay.
You had friends in Chicago?
Yeah.
You can have friends here.
Didn't you guys get in a fight in English?
We've made peace.
That's what separates us from the animals.
Dirtbag alert.
- I gotta talk to you.
- Easy, slick. Steven's relaxing.
The Yogurt Shoppe.
What the fuck is a "shoppy"?
Why don't you make like a tree and leave?
Clever girl. Come on, Steve.
We get in one argument, and you go bond with these guys?
What happened to you?
Did you eat too much flank steak?
- Let's go.
- You don't have to go, brother.
I'm not your brother.
You wanted to tell me something?
Here I am. What?
- They're hypnotized.
- What?
Maybe not hypnotized, but brainwashed, lobotomized, programmed.
Want proof? Here. Here's proof.
Look. That's Robby, Randi, Trent.
They used to be my friends.
Maybe they got sick of your rap.
I can relate.
I thought you'd say that. That is the purpose of tonight's excursion.
After tonight, you'll strap on a hog and be a man.
It's something that benefits everybody.
The Thespian Society, for example...
Blue Ribbon meeting. Every Monday.
This is where the shit goes down. Listen.
By conducting the bake sale in conjunction with the pep rally... we can be selling cakes and cookies when school spirit is at its optimum.
I had no idea the evil was this pervasive.
Jan, what's on your mind?
This may sound strange, but... although we couldn't be more pleased with Andrew's improved studies... he's become somewhat different... since returning from your weekend enlightenment seminar.
Different how?
He seems unkind to almost everyone outside of the club.
I can understand your concern.
Let me address it.
Kids being kids have a tendency to overreact.
We've found they go through a brief period... of being, shall we say, snobby.
But what it really is is a feeling that's new to them.
The feeling is pride.
They're improved.
When you soar with the eagles, the pigeons below look pedestrian.
- Give it a little time.
- Dork.
Now, a new candidate has been nominated.
His parents have been counseled and consented.
Colleen, if you will.
- Male, 17 years old...
- Superstar.
Suspended four times last school year.
Parents feel candidate is depressed... spending too much time listening to rock music and masturbating.
- Candidate has a history of truancy...
- Poor son of a bitch.
And a general lack of direction.
Candidate is C-minus student, yet has A-plus potential.
All in favor?
Great. February candidate confirmed.
- Training to begin ASAP.
- Shit.
- What?
- Join me in welcoming to our circle...
Ernest and Lucille Strick... the parents of our next superstar,
Gavin Strick.
They want you to join their club.
Shine them on and blow them off.
- What are they gonna do?
- You still don't get it.
You still think this is about blood drives and bake sales.
Wait a second.
Maybe you should lay off that shit.
Maybe you should eat me.
Yeah.
This is huge.
Why don't you see this is fucking huge?
Don't fucking "Gavin" me. I'm a dead man.
My parents sold me out.
You saw it. You were there.
Why don't you see this?
Stay at my house tonight.
I have to go home.
When I get there and they're waiting for me, I'll smoke them all. You hear me?
Everyone who's at my house:
Robby, Whalen, Caldicott, even my olds.
- Give me the gun.
- No fucking way.
- Let me have it!
- No! You're losing it!
You'll wind up shooting the paperboy.
- Just go home.
- Give me my fucking gun.
Good night.
Don't leave me alone like this!
Stevie Boy?
I would have smoked them all. Fuck, man.
Wait a minute.
- What is this?
- I don't believe...
Show time.
Who put the acid in my Spam?
- Hello.
- What is up with this?
I just want to apply myself.
I think I'll get better results on this side of the caf.
Beat it, honey. This is rarefied turf.
Sluts need not apply.
Later.
How much do I owe you?
- Treat yourself.
- Indeed.
- Where you going?
- I'm going to talk to Gavin.
You're not wanted, Steven.
Just leave him be.
Get the fuck off me.
Guys, come on.
What's your maladjustment?
You okay?
Forget it! Stop it!
That's enough!
What happened to you?
We shall overcome, Steven.
- You okay?
- Man, fantastic.
You'll see.
Retard.
Are you okay?
What are you doing here?
You're not supposed to be here.
- I hate the caf.
- Everybody hates the caf.
They hate the ketchup.
I got...
That's not good.
Doesn't even look like ketchup.
"Slaughterhouse-Five"?
What? Give me that!
What the hell's the matter with you?
You rats from the Bay. You rats!
Rats everywhere.
You kids think you know everything!
You don't know nothing!
Forget the rats. It's all an act.
- You don't know.
- It's all bullshit.
Get away from me!
Brother!
Wait.
Do you like Kurt Vonnegut?
I don't get it.
Didn't you ever want to just disappear, lunch boy?
Poof, you're gone.
You'd be surprised how interesting people become... when they think you are really stupid.
- Who is it?
- Calm down, Steven.
Where you going, Steven?
- There's nothing to be afraid of.
- Here is the light, Steven.
Hello, Steven.
What are you doing here?
- I'm tutoring Lindsay in Algebra.
- Where is she?
- Where's my sister?
- She's upstairs sleeping.
- Where are my parents?
- At a meeting.
- What meeting?
- Steven, you're hurt.
- I'll live.
- Let me put something on that.
It's fine.
Maybe you should go.
I mean it.
- If that's what you want.
- Yeah.
Can I go to the bathroom first?
Sure. It's around the corner.
I know where it is.
Of course you do. Everyone knows where everything is around here.
Your sister's a great kid.
She's very special.
Hello, Steven.
- What are you doing?
- I'm not sure really.
Go home, Lorna.
You don't find me slightly attractive?
I find you very attractive.
It's just that you're a Blue Ribbon and I'm not.
So...
Wait a second.
I'm not supposed to be doing this.
It's bad, wrong. Wrong, bad.
It's not bad. It's... Jesus Christ.
I have to go home.
I have a big physics test tomorrow.
After extracting the implant...
I tested its integrity to the optic nerve, and it was intact.
The chip is functioning properly.
But I did find that excess stimulation to the pineal gland... caused the dopamine levels to go through the roof.
Every time one of these kids gets a hard-on, they beat somebody with it.
We could do a cingulotomy.
No. Cut a craniotomy flap.
I'll get elbow deep, see what happens.
- What?
- Cut the bruises out of the banana.
What about her parents?
Tell them she'll be missing cheerleading practice this week.
Look. Cook's Ridge trash.
Once you've all settled in,
I'm sure she'll fit in just fine.
- Thanks, Dr. Caldicott.
- Did you hear that, Nancy?
Yeah, Mom.
Come on, let's go. I gotta sell this bud.
I got two customers left.
If this keeps up,
I'll be the 7-Eleven guy.
I'm gonna grab a smoke.
Come out, come out, wherever you are.
I saw you come down here, Rachel.
I just want to ask you something.
What do you want?
I just want to know...
It's me asking, not my friends.
Will you go out with me?
You're kidding, right?
Will you, please?
No, Chug, I won't.
Why not?
How about this?
You couldn't repulse me more if you were made out of shit and maggots!
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- You want to be that way?
- Stop it. I'll scream. I swear to God.
- Yeah?
- Yeah!
What will happen if you do?
I'm a Blue Ribbon, baby. Team captain.
You're just a trashy, tattooed love doll.
Come on, Rae-Rae, give up the plate for Chug. Come on!
Fuck!
Stop it!
What you looking at, retard?
Wow.
I guess I just think you should try and fit in.
We're gonna be here for a long time.
You, me, Mom and Dad.
And Chip and Dale.
- What is this?
- What?
- Where did you get this?
- I got it at school.
They were handing them out.
We all got one.
- Go inside.
- Why?
- I said go inside!
- Spaz.
- We should talk.
- Yeah.
There's something you need to see.
Rae, Gavin Strick here.
Live and unplugged.
Guess if you found this, then you know.
Am I hanging with Trent and Robby... and the rest of the Robots?
God, I hope not.
I hit the vents tonight when I split up with Stevie Boy.
He doesn't believe.
I went back to school... and I overheard Caldicott talking to some wonk.
Mentioned "Bishop Flats Eleven."
Caldicott called them his children.
Then he freaked out on the guy and kicked him out of his office.
So, I figure something's up with that.
Keep an eye on U.V. For me, though I doubt they'll want him.
I doubt they're interested in the pigmentally challenged.
That's not their style.
I have to go get paranoid.
This is Gavin Strick... reporting live from The Reconstruction.
I pulled this off the AMA database.
Caldicott's last place of employment... was across the bay in Bishop Flats... at the Bellknop Psychiatric Facility.
He spent seven years doing neuropharmacology.
Mind control.
Next ferry's at 6:00.
- Bishop Flats?
- You down for it?
Razor.
Let's go.
- I miss Gavin. He's almost like a...
- A brother?
Yeah, exactly.
I had a brother.
Sorry.
His name was Allen.
He was a couple years older than me.
If he had made it through his teens, he would have been amazing.
But he was always in pain.
And eight months to the day he shot himself...
Dad said we were moving to Cradle Bay... where everything was gonna be all right.
- I'm sorry.
- No, don't.
Let's go.
Maybe this isn't a good idea.
Think of it as our first date.
That's why my toothes are clean.
Be pretty... and do it just right.
Children.
Meet the musical little creatures... that hide among the flowers.
Shut up.
Let's get out of here.
It's Caldicott's daughter.
His own daughter.
How can nobody not know there's something fucked up in Bishop Flat?
Shit, his own daughter was in there.
Nobody's safe.
The last ferry leaves at 11:30.
Tell me you have a razor plan.
- I am making this shit up as I go.
- Great.
Shit.
Hi, Officer Cox.
Closing time, Frankie.
Yeah, it's getting late.
Just be cool.
It's past curfew.
She's driving me home.
- From?
- Studying.
Where are your books?
- Evening, Officer.
- What are you doing?
I'm getting rid of rats.
The pink-eyed vermin can't see for spit.
Quarter a rat.
Town council gives me a quarter a rat.
I'm going to be rich at this rate.
I'll be on...
- "Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous."
- Moron.
- Where are you going?
- Can we go now?
Step out of the truck, now.
- What are you doing?
- Hey!
Let her go! What do you want from us?
Get in here.
That's a big rat.
Come on, get out of there!
What are you waiting for? Get!
Let's get out of here.
Come on, Steve.
You have to trust me for now.
Do you trust me?
Where are you going?
I'm taking Lindsay away from here.
We're going back to Chicago.
- Don't do this. You're scaring me.
- I'm scared too, Mom, believe me.
Stevie, you have to know we're here for you no matter what.
- God, do you really mean that?
- Of course we do.
- Then let's all go home.
- Steven, you are home.
Cradle Bay is where you belong.
Here with your family.
You signed me up for the program?
- We want what's best for you.
- What about what I want?
Look, Steven, do you really like the way you feel?
Shut the fuck up!
You sold me out.
- We didn't. We just want you back.
- Steven, please...
My name is Steve, okay?
Nobody calls me Steven except for them.
Fine. Come on, Linds.
May I have this dance?
Where's Rachel?
She's gone to an institute of higher learning, Steven.
- Help!
- Everything's under control.
Who's your daddy?
Respect yourself, Steven.
Ice, ice, baby.
It's not what you think.
It's a new kind of cool.
You feel better, freer.
I've never felt so alive in my life.
- It's humanity's sacred essence.
- A new and finer age.
Go forward.
Be the ball.
People will know when I get out of here.
That's right, they will know.
They'll know because you'll be better.
Adolescence is a minefield.
But soon, you'll be fully equipped to walk right through it.
Yeah, straight A's and a letter jacket.
And every now and then, you rape and kill.
To cure cancer, you gotta kill a few white mice.
Meet the musical little creatures... that hide among the flowers.
That's a battle I didn't win.
You'll be different.
I know so much more now.
She wasn't that bright to begin with.
Be all that's good.
Stop fooling around.
Let the light in.
Be excellent.
You're number one. You're an ace.
Achieve.
You'll be okay.
Going somewhere with my custard, Steven?
Let's go, Chug.
That's my girl you got there.
I can't let you take her.
Come on! Get up!
Come on, Rae-Rae, give up the plate for old Chug.
Come on.
- Not so fast.
- What?
What's the capital of North Dakota?
How the fuck should I know?
Okay, you're cool. Get in.
We gotta book.
Early bird ferry's in 20 minutes.
Shit, man.
It's time to leave mediocrity behind.
Step up on the bus.
What is it?
Come and get it, you blue bastards!
What is going on?
Come on.
Get them to the ferry.
I'll meet you down there.
Don't leave without me.
- Lunch boy.
- What are you doing?
We can't very well have these shitbirds... graduating and going off into the world.
Maybe they can be helped.
No, they can't. And neither can I.
Do good things, lunch boy.
Hey, teacher!
Leave those kids alone!
It's over, you son of a bitch.
It's finished.
"Finished"?
There will always be other towns... and other troubled teens... and other worried parents.
Science is God.
Be the ball.
- What happened?
- We're the only ones left.
So, what do we do now?
We go home.
And where's that?
Wherever.
Wherever we are.
Appropriate sparks are flying.
Somebody cue up the power ballad, man.
All right now, settle down.
Turn that damn thing off.
Now, y'all got a new student teacher starting today.
I want you to show him a little bit more respect than the last one.
Speak of the devil.
Say hello to your new student teacher, class.
They're all yours.
Peckerhead.
Hello, class. Welcome.
Be excellent.
Yes. Wonderful.
Meet the musical little creatures... that hide in the flowers.
Treat yourself.

{2777}{2862}I'II remind you we are|in the vanguard of research.
{3844}{3918}Get KIump in here now.
{3919}{3966}- Professor KIump.|- Good mornin'.

{5383}{5431}Oh, my goodness.
{5656}{5715}Professor KIump, the cages-|what happened?
{5716}{5817}That is most pecuIiar, Jason,|because I distinctIy remember|Iocking up Iast night.
{5819}{5903}I Iocked these cages, picked up|my portfoIio and turned around-
{6044}{6097}Oh. Ha-ha-ha.
{6099}{6158}I must've grazed the switch.|Ha-ha.
{6159}{6239}- SheIIey's the onIy one|that didn't get out.|- Good. I'II tend to SheIIey.
{6240}{6303}You students take care of this.|Excuse me.
{6305}{6385}HeIIo, SheIIey. How are you today,|my IittIe powder puff?
{6387}{6447}Yeah. Yeah.
{6448}{6495}- Sir?
{6496}{6563}You may want to Iook at|the Iatest test resuIts.
{6564}{6647}I'm not sure if I'm|reading them correctIy.
{6648}{6746}- She's Iost three ounces|since the Iast feed?|- Must be some kind of mistake.
{6795}{6881}No, no, Jason.|Her entire moIecuIar structure|has been reaIigned.
{6919}{6997}We've done it.|This new formuIa's working.
{6999}{7045}It's actuaIIy reconstructed|SheIIey's DNA.
{7047}{7122}She Iost 20 percent|of her body fat in one feeding.
{7123}{7170}What if we upped the dosage?
{7171}{7255}No, one step at a time.|We don't want to jeopardize SheIIey.
{7257}{7303}- We'II keep the feedings as scheduIed.|- Okay.
{7305}{7351}ScheduIe. Excuse me.|I'm very Iate.
{7353}{7447}Students, we got a Iot of work to do|and don't have much time to do it in.
{7449}{7543}Tryin' to win a grant here.|So, as Arsenio used to say,|Iet's get busy!
{8043}{8119}- Comfy?|- Quite.
{8121}{8205}Anything I can get for you?|Juice? Coffee? Rack of Iamb?
{8207}{8253}No, sir, I'm fine.
{8484}{8555}You, uh, did want to see me|about something, didn't you, sir?
{8556}{8615}WeII, Professor KIump,
{8616}{8699}aIIow me to answer that question|by posing another.
{8701}{8778}- Why are you trying|to destroy my schooI?|- Beg your pardon, sir?
{8779}{8887}- Do you know who|Louise Vindovik is?|- Oh, sureIy, sir.
{8889}{8966}She's a IoveIy woman who so|generousIy donates money to heIp|fund our science department.
{8967}{9014}Ooh! CIose.|Very cIose. But wrong.
{9015}{9138}See, she was a IoveIy woman, and she|used to fund our science department.
{9139}{9210}That was before she was hospitaIized|for nearIy swaIIowing a gerbiI.
{9211}{9258}Not gerbiI, sir.|A hamster.
{9259}{9342}GerbiIs are more streamIined and|hamsters have a tendency to be fIuffier.
{9343}{9414}The maIe hamster's scrotum has|a tendency to be disproportionateIy-
{9415}{9470}Never mind.
{9471}{9518}Those NationaI RifIe peopIe|are right.
{9519}{9590}If I had one now- bang.
{9591}{9647}Sir, I'd Iike to concentrate|on the positives.
{9648}{9719}What Ms. Vindovik witnessed|was 5,000 heaIthy hamsters...
{9720}{9782}bred from a geneticaIIy deficient|hereditary Iine.
{9783}{9830}It's actuaIIy very exciting.
{9831}{9878}Do I Iook excited, KIump?
{9879}{9938}Uh, no, you don't|Iook excited at aII.
{9939}{10010}But maybe you might be hoIding it in,|your excitement,
{10011}{10079}not wanting to...|express it.
{10080}{10171}Now Iisten to me carefuIIy,|you fat tub of goo.
{10173}{10295}For years you've singIe-handedIy|aIienated every weaIthy donor we've had.
{10297}{10355}Air-conditioning schooIs|are outdrawing us!
{10356}{10420}We've Iost so much money,|red is our schooI coIor.
{10422}{10495}Inner-city schooIs|have better computers than we do.
{10496}{10550}Bosnia wants to give us money!
{10551}{10652}I'm going to set up a meeting|with HarIan HartIey- KIump!|Are you Iistening?
{10654}{10738}- Uh, yes, sir. Yes.|- HartIey is the Iast|rich aIumnus we've got.
{10739}{10798}And he's a science fan.
{10799}{10893}And he's considering donating|a $10 miIIion grant to this schooI.
{10895}{10965}And I want that money, KIump.
{10967}{11013}Your job depends upon it.
{11015}{11091}I'II Iet you know how to handIe it,|since I'II be watching you. Now go.
{11093}{11151}- But, sir, I don't know|if you shouId-|- Ah-ah-ah.
{11153}{11242}See, right back there, just before|you said, ""But, sir-"" Right there?
{11267}{11320}That was the end|of the meeting.
{11322}{11368}WeII, I guess|I'II Ieave.
{11370}{11416}You have a pIeasant day.
{11909}{11974}Grace, the cream|has turned again.
{12099}{12209}Of aII the equations you'II Iearn|during the course of your studies here,
{12211}{12306}this equation shaII be,|I promise you,
{12307}{12390}the most heIpfuI throughout|the course of your studies,
{12391}{12486}because this equation|fundamentaIIy breaks down...
{12487}{12599}what DNA is composed of...
{12600}{12647}and what components of DNA-
{12702}{12775}- I seem to have messed myseIf.
{12777}{12864}I haven't reaIIy messed myseIf.|I mean, I messed my shirt up.
{12926}{13011}But, uh, make sure you read chapter four|in your textbooks on genetics.

{14838}{14886}The tabIe's more coIorfuI and-
{14887}{14982}- WouId another time be better?|I couId aIways-|- No, no, don't be ridicuIous.
{14983}{15068}- I'm between cIasses|and I got a m-minute to chat.
{15070}{15143}- How can I heIp you?|- Hi. I'm CarIa Purty.

{55844}{55920}""Sherman, no matter what,|you've got to strut.

{78404}{78472}I thought you was gonna get|angry and start screamin'...
{78474}{78531}and hoIIerin',|and maybe even fire me.
{78532}{78581}Whoo!
{78583}{78677}Oh, Sherman, Sherman. In the end|we know so IittIe of each other, hmm?
{78679}{78730}No, my friend, I've got|bigger fish to fry.
{78731}{78782}I spoke to HarIan HartIey.
{78783}{78859}He's offering that tiny trinket that|couId save your entire research program.
{78861}{78938}- Oh, yes. AbsoIuteIy.|- I set up a meeting with him.
{78939}{79038}He wants to hear your grant|proposaI personaIIy- Friday,|the Ritz, dinner, 8:00 sharp.
{79039}{79131}WeII, sir, I think that's|a wonderfuI idea, sir. AbsoIuteIy.
{79133}{79209}- And I promise you,|I wiII not Iet you down.|- I know you won't.
{79211}{79269}I know you're going to be there,|and you're going to be great.
{79271}{79336}- In fact, I know you're|going to be perfect.
{79338}{79391}- Do you know how I know?|- How's that?
{79392}{79507}'Cause if you're not perfect,|never mind the yeIIing and|the screaming and the firing.
{79508}{79558}If anything goes wrong|for any reason,
{79559}{79619}I'm going to kiII you.
{79620}{79700}I don't mean that as a euphemism.|I'm going to IiteraIIy kiII you.
{79702}{79807}I'm going to strangIe you|and choke off your air suppIy...
{79808}{79859}untiI you pass away.
{79887}{79956}Ooh, okay.
{79958}{80028}'TiI Friday, then.
{80030}{80096}It's a date.
{80253}{80304}Sir, this is incredibIe.
{80305}{80376}It's- It's a compIete|metaboIic transformation.|How did it happen?
{80377}{80476}- Was it an accident?|- No, I did it to myseIf, Jason.
{80477}{80524}You did? Why?
{80525}{80632}If it was for the grant,|the data with SheIIey|was aIready so compeIIing.
{80633}{80717}WeII, I have compeIIing|reasons of my own, Jason.
{80718}{80796}I have a case of infatuation|of sorts with Miss Purty.
{80797}{80890}Professor, if you feeI this way|about CarIa, why don't you teII her?
{80892}{80950}It'd be a Iot simpIer|than transforming into-
{80952}{81019}This guy's testosterone IeveIs|are right off the charts.
{81021}{81088}He was mean Iast night.|It was so unIike you.
{81089}{81168}- You know, I did feeI that.|- Sir, you can't controI him.
{81169}{81258}Jason, you have no idea|what it feeIs Iike to be Buddy Love.
{81260}{81324}It's indescribabIe.|It's just wonderfuI!
{81325}{81408}The way peopIe taIk to him and|treat him, and the way she Iooks at him.
{81409}{81477}But he's dangerous.|He aImost kiIIed us Iast night.
{81478}{81565}We shouId be concentrating on getting|the grant proposaI to HarIan HartIey.
{81566}{81613}This is nuts!
{81666}{81761}I guess you're right, Jason.|I never have behaved Iike this before.
{81818}{81901}But on the other hand,
{81902}{81976}I've never been in Iove before.
{81977}{82024}Ever.
{82475}{82539}- Afternoon, CarIa.|- Hi, Sherman.
{82541}{82609}- How are you doing today?|- Pretty good.
{82611}{82678}I come over to see how things|were going with you and Buddy.
{82680}{82726}I wish I knew.
{82728}{82817}We went out Iast night. It was great.|We had such a wonderfuI time.
{82819}{82881}And then aII of a sudden|he runs out of the cIub.
{82883}{82929}He has some aIIergic reaction.
{82931}{82993}- I don't even know if he's aII right.|- He's fine.
{82995}{83073}He toId me that his Iip|sweIIed up, he put ice on it|and the sweIIing came down.
{83074}{83163}- Kinda strange, huh?|- WeII, did he even ask about me?
{83165}{83246}Did he say why he didn't caII me|and Iet me know he was aII right?
{83248}{83294}CarIa, Buddy's kind of unreIiabIe.
{83296}{83381}He's kind of what you caII|a ""here today, gone tomorrow""|kind of feIIow.
{83383}{83429}- Oh, I see.|- Mm-hmm.
{83431}{83523}So he had you taIk to me|because he's not interested anymore.
{83525}{83577}- No, it's nothing quite Iike that.|- Look.
{83579}{83655}I know what it feeIs Iike|to be brushed off, and it's okay.
{83657}{83760}This is aII my fauIt.|I shouId've never encouraged|you to go out with Buddy.
{83761}{83841}Sherman, you have been so sweet.
{83843}{83938}I'II just have to forget about him.|I'II see you Iater.
{83940}{84012}CarIa.
{84013}{84074}I was wonderin' if, uh,
{84076}{84145}I couId taIk to you|about you and I for a second.
{84147}{84193}I was-
{84233}{84306}I was wonderin' what|you were doin' Iater, 'cause...
{84308}{84357}the famiIy gonna get together.
{84358}{84409}She made a meaI and...
{84411}{84508}we gonna be eatin', so I figured if you|not doin' anything for dinner,
{84509}{84621}we'd Iove to have you,|if you want to come over for dinner.
{84623}{84677}We'd Iove to have you|over for dinner.
{84701}{84748}I'd Iove to.
{84749}{84809}- WouId you, now?|- Yes, I wouId.
{84811}{84862}ShouId we caII and make sure there's|going to be enough food?
{84864}{84945}I don't think that's|going to be a probIem.
{84954}{85025}- There's nothing|Iike being with famiIy!
{85026}{85084}I am hungry. Come on now.
{85085}{85158}- CarIa, where are you from?|- Chicago.
{85160}{85225}- Oh, Chicago!|We have famiIy there.|- Windy City, huh?
{85227}{85330}I was workin' on a skyscraper|in Chicago once and my Iunch|bIew off the 27th fIoor.
{85332}{85458}Yeah, I figure your fat ass|wouId remember somebody's|sandwich fIyin' off a buiIding.
{85460}{85517}- Oh, baby, eat some bread.
{85519}{85574}Miss Purty, are you and Sherman|havin' reIations?
{85576}{85654}- That's a good question.|- Uh, no, Grandma.
{85656}{85710}It's not Iike- Iike that.|We're coIIeagues.
{85712}{85761}- Oh.|- We just work together.
{85763}{85809}That's how it start out- coIIeagues.
{85811}{85857}Me and your grandfather|was coIIeagues.
{85859}{85929}Next thing you know he's on top of me|in the shed, pumpin' and a-sweatin'.
{85931}{85985}- It's not Iike that.|- WiII you hush up?
{85987}{86054}You never brought a girI home.|The Ieast you can do|is Iet us taIk to her.
{86056}{86120}Yeah, I'd Iike to get to know her|a IittIe better myseIf.
{86121}{86188}Ain't nothing wrong|with havin' reIations.|Don't be ashamed of that.
{86189}{86280}ReIations is beautifuI. When I was young|I used to aIways have reIations.
{86281}{86393}Every night, if a nice gentIeman|bring me fIowers and candy,
{86394}{86485}take me to a movie,|show me a IoveIy evenin',
{86486}{86585}then I wouId take him home|and give him hot, IoveIy reIations.
{86586}{86657}ReIations is a beautifuI thing.|It's nothing to be ashamed of.
{86658}{86713}EspeciaIIy two young peopIe.
{86715}{86780}- That bIowhoIe.|- CIetus!
{86781}{86872}- Sometimes when I'm aIone,|I reIate to myseIf.|- I can reIate.
{86873}{86969}- Oh, Mama.|- I don't wanna hear|this shit whiIe I'm eatin'.
{86971}{87030}- CIetus!|- I'm gonna kiII you Iater.
{87032}{87096}- CarIa, do you Iike chiIdren?|- Yes. Oh, that's wonderfuI.
{87097}{87168}I can't wait for Sherman|to bring me home some grandbabies.
{87169}{87261}I know you're gonna|enjoy making them babies.|Got those chiIdbearing hips.
{87263}{87325}- Baby'II pop right out.
{87326}{87393}Your famiIy got any money?|I ain't payin' for no big-ass wedding.
{87395}{87470}I know a wonderfuI minister.|What reIigious background are you?
{87472}{87569}I stiII got my wedding dress.|If you want it, I'II take it in.
{87570}{87652}You'd Iook so IoveIy in it.|It's white, though.
{87653}{87715}Can you wear a white wedding dress,|young Iady?
{87717}{87817}Now, Sherman,|you can wear a white tuxedo.
{87819}{87905}'Cause you know Sherman- Sherman|has never had reIations.
{87906}{87957}Mama, you gonna|embarrass my baby.
{87958}{88019}- I hope you got a strong back.|- Oh, Iook at my baby bIushin'.
{88021}{88111}When you get aII that man, and reIease|aII that that's been buiIt up...
{88113}{88177}for 35 years-
{88179}{88260}Just wantin' and wantin'|and wantin'!
{88261}{88321}Whoo! Might make|your head bIow off.
{88323}{88381}Pop goes the weaseI!
{88382}{88437}I got my own seIf hot|teIIin' that story.
{88438}{88501}Pop goes the weaseI,|'cause the weaseI say ""pop""!
{88502}{88549}You gonna get married|here or in Chicago?
{88550}{88617}Do you cook?|'Cause somebody's got to|feed my Sherman.
{88619}{88689}Yeah, I know a wonderfuI church|down there on Main Street,
{88690}{88737}but they won't marry you|if you're a Iesbian.
{88738}{88822}Not that I have anything|against Iesbians. I Iove Iesbians.
{88824}{88908}- Lesbians is cooI.|- There's nothing wrong|with a IittIe bingo.
{88909}{88956}A IittIe cunniIingus|ain't never hurt nobody.
{88957}{89036}- Why is it the woman aIways gets the|choice where they're gonna be married?|- Tradition.
{89037}{89130}Tradition, my ass! I ain't gonna pay|for everybody fIyin' to no Chicago!
{89132}{89188}- You know how much pIane tickets cost?|- You cheap bastard.
{89189}{89240}We're gonna have to|drive down there.
{89241}{89295}I'm not driving over to Chicago.
{89323}{89412}* Sherman gonna have reIations *
{89413}{89504}- My baby's not gettin' married-
{89505}{89600}There you go again, poppin' off gas|in front of this IoveIy young Iady.
{89601}{89653}We're trying to have a meaI.|Put that brake on this gas.
{89655}{89741}I hope your ass|turn into a frog.
{89742}{89802}- Don't nobody want to hear|your fIatuIence, CIetus KIump.
{89804}{89849}You're such a disgrace!
{89851}{89921}- I stopped hoIding my gas|a Iong time ago.|- You spoiIed the dinner!
{89922}{89982}- Say one more word-
{90032}{90104}- Listen, CarIa,
{90105}{90164}I want to apoIogize|about my famiIy back there.
{90165}{90274}- I think they got|the wrong idea about things.|- Oh, no. I shouId apoIogize.
{90276}{90336}I'm so sorry if I seemed|distant tonight.
{90337}{90403}I stiII have Buddy on my mind.
{90405}{90483}- You reaIIy care for Buddy, huh?|- I don't know.
{90485}{90595}I mean, on the outside,|he seems so cocky and brash.
{90597}{90685}But when I Iook in his eyes,|I see kindness, I see warmth.
{90687}{90751}And that's the side of Buddy|I wanted to get to know.
{90753}{90819}I just got way|ahead of myseIf.
{90821}{90911}And here I am, taIking your ear off|once again about Buddy.
{90913}{90961}No, it's quite aII right, reaIIy.
{90963}{91009}Listen, CarIa,
{91011}{91074}don't you worry about Buddy.
{91076}{91122}I'II find him for you.
{91157}{91209}Thank you, Sherman.
{91211}{91281}Thank you for being|such a good friend to me.
{91308}{91354}A good friend.
{91519}{91565}Good night.
{91567}{91613}Good night.
{92168}{92273}- Professor?
{92274}{92325}Is that you?
{92326}{92405}I just finished|the grant proposaI.
{92487}{92561}What's the matter with you? Never seen|a brother wearing a circus tent before?
{92563}{92650}- BIack man can't go campin'?|- Now, wait a minute.|You- You can't be you.
{92652}{92698}We agreed that|you wouIdn't do this.
{92700}{92757}Someone has to tend|to chunky butt's sex Iife.
{92759}{92825}Chunky butt is extremeIy horny.|Excuse me.
{92827}{92922}But Professor KIump|has a meeting tonight with|HarIan HartIey at the Ritz.
{92924}{93001}I'm gonna be at the Ritz|tonight, but it wiII not be|in the interest of science.
{93002}{93063}No! I can't Iet you go.
{93065}{93113}Professor!
{93115}{93213}If you're in there|and you can hear me, come out!
{93214}{93320}Professor, Iisten to me.|The testosterone IeveIs|are way too high.
{93321}{93393}- You can't controI him.
{93493}{93562}- Oh! Jason!|- What?
{93564}{93661}It's me, Sherman. I'm taIking to you|from deep down inside Buddy Love.
{93663}{93744}Listen to me cIoseIy. Go in|the back room whiIe I'm hoIding him...
{93745}{93821}- and get the coaguIant serum|off the back sheIf!|- In the storage cIoset?
{93822}{93884}- Yes, Jason! Hurry, Jason!|- I got it!
{93885}{93948}- We don't have much time. Let's move!|- I got it!
{94005}{94060}Professor!|Professor!
{94061}{94136}I have an appointment with Iove!|Good night, hamster boy!
{94137}{94197}- No, Professor!
{94712}{94792}""Sorry I haven't phoned,|but I haven't been myseIf IateIy.
{94793}{94854}""Join me for dinner. Buddy Love.
{94856}{94965}P.S. I've encIosed a waIIet-sized photo|for your enjoyment.''
{95173}{95240}Buddy, how can I stay mad at you?|This is gorgeous!
{95241}{95312}You're gorgeous and I'm gorgeous, so we|shouId be in gorgeous surroundings.
{95313}{95365}- Let me get the room key.|- Wait. HoId it.
{95366}{95425}I didn't say anything|about going to any room with you.
{95426}{95489}You said you were|taking me to dinner.
{95491}{95557}What are you taIking about?|Oh, you think that- Oh!
{95558}{95605}Oh, my- Hey, hey, hey.|SIow down.
{95606}{95670}I just want to spend|some time with you, by ourseIves.
{95672}{95769}I don't want to|share you with these peopIe.|I want to eat, aIone, quiet.
{95771}{95865}I wouId never disrespect you.|I'm a puppy dog.
{95866}{95937}PIease, can I go|get this room?
{95986}{96049}- Yes?|- Yes.
{96051}{96133}I'd throw him in the river|with a Buick tied to his neck.|He'd probabIy drag the car down.
{96134}{96181}- Miss Purty. Purty!|- Dean Richmond.
{96182}{96242}Have you seen Professor KIump?|He's 40 minutes Iate.
{96244}{96310}If HarIan HartIey waIks out that door,|$10 miIIion goes with him.
{96312}{96381}Oh, Lord. I'm gonna have to Iay down|in front of his car.
{96382}{96441}- Let's go.|- Buddy, you know Sherman's research.
{96442}{96502}He's Iate for a meeting.|FiII in for him.
{96504}{96581}No, it's a nice thought, but he'd|have to know Sherman's research.
{96583}{96633}You know Sherman's research?|Who are you?
{96635}{96720}You might say I'm a visiting professor|who might be staying for a whiIe.
{96721}{96796}- I do know Sherman's work.|In fact, I am Sherman's work.|- Buddy!
{96797}{96873}Do you think you can do KIump's job|and crowbar that dough out of HartIey?
{96875}{96957}There's not a job on this pIanet|I can't do twice as good as Sherman.
{96958}{97030}Good. FoIIow me.
{97032}{97093}I'II go do this just 'cause|you asked me, not 'cause of him.
{97094}{97144}You just stay put.
{97145}{97220}I've got to go be briIIiant.|Look at your fine seIf.
{97221}{97313}I bet you have on|a thong made of Iicorice, don't you?
{97314}{97357}Excuse me.
{97366}{97443}AII righty!
{97445}{97501}WeII, this had better be|Professor KIump.
{97502}{97565}KIump? That fraud,|that hack, that no-taIent.
{97566}{97635}No, sir, this is the man|behind KIump's work, the reaI genius.
{97637}{97683}I give you|Professor Buddy Love.
{97685}{97778}AII right, Professor Love. You have|one minute to show me your research.
{97780}{97876}No, you got it backwards, RockefeIIer.|You have one minute to Iisten.
{97877}{97929}May I borrow this?|You haven't used it, have you?
{97931}{98005}Don't want to get|your boogers on my fingers.|Okay. Here we go.
{98007}{98061}25N times C.
{98062}{98147}You have to excuse my handwriting.|I'm in a bit of a rush.
{98149}{98229}- You have a pIeasant evening.|Good night.|- Uh, Professor Love,
{98231}{98331}don't you think Mr. HartIey wouId Iike|to know what that means in Iay terms?
{98333}{98411}- Oh, you mean rich-dummy terms?
{98413}{98505}I'II break it down for the rich dummies|in the room. Listen up.
{98507}{98553}If you eat nasty stuff|Iike this-
{98555}{98625}I know it Iooks good,|and some of y'aII Iike pork chops,
{98627}{98742}but this greasy, nasty pork chop-|there's a gene in your D.N.A....
{98744}{98841}that routes this straight|to your fat ceIIs, and it|causes unsightIy conditions.
{98936}{99057}The arm is taking on a geIatin|sort of vibe. It's quite nasty.
{99058}{99121}To my Ieft, this gentIeman|has turkey neck.
{99123}{99186}To my immediate Ieft,|this woman is suffering|from what we Iike to caII...
{99188}{99234}""saddIebag syndrome.""
{99236}{99358}To my extreme Ieft,|this young Iady is suffering|from what I Iike to caII ""tank ass.""
{99360}{99442}PIease, sit down.|Not tonight. I'm your brother!
{99444}{99514}Like I was saying, everybody,|where there's a wiII, there's a way.
{99516}{99583}There is a way we can|turn these genes off.
{99585}{99653}I'm not taIking about|using exercise or diet.
{99654}{99716}I'm taIking about|by taking a simpIe soIution...
{99717}{99800}that heIps reconstruct|your metaboIic ceIIuIar strands,
{99801}{99913}thus giving you the appearance|of, in medicaI terms, gIuteus minimus.
{99914}{99993}Or, in Iayman's terms,|an extremeIy tight, wonderfuI ass.
{99994}{100053}Let's give a big round of appIause|for the woman with the nice ass.
{100054}{100128}Her ass is so nice, don't you agree?|She's worked so hard.
{100129}{100208}Have a seat.|Oh, are these girIs with you?
{100209}{100268}Everyone has a nice ass|at this tabIe.
{100269}{100327}Is this the nice-ass section?
{100329}{100401}- Where'd you find this man?|- HarIan, it's an outrage.
{100402}{100467}I assure you he has no affiIiation|with this schooI.
{100469}{100522}- He's briIIiant.|- ExactIy my point.
{100524}{100614}It's an outrage that his briIIiance|has no affiIiation with this schooI.

{115079}{115159}WeII, I must admit,|it didn't seem Iike the Sherman I knew.

{124501}{124569}you do just about anything|to get it.

{125894}{125965}Why didn't you|say anything?
{125967}{126091}I didn't think you'd have me. I mean,|the fact of the matter is I'm a big man.
{126093}{126205}Now, I wiII Iose weight, but I'm|aIways gonna be big no matter what I do.
{126207}{126317}So, anybody I wind up with is just goin'|to have to accept me for who I am.
{126319}{126433}And more important, I'm just going|to have to accept myseIf for who I am.
{126497}{126543}Sherman,
{126545}{126613}I don't have a date tonight.

In the year 2022, the international prison system is operated by private corporations.
Criminals from all over the world are exploited at a profit.
Prisons have become big business.
Company, man the right!
Eyes... right!
Company, man the right!
March!
Eyes front.
I said, eyes front!
LEVITICUS
LEVEL 6 MAXIMUM SECURITY PENITENTIARY
You have come here from all over the world... because society has no further use for you.
The international prison system... has given up all hopes of your rehabilitation.
This place will now be your holding pen until your death.
Because death is the only way out.
There's no chance of reprieve here-- no possibility of escape.
You are condemned.
Either accept it... or die.
I want to see Prisoner 2675.
2011, Benghazi, Libya.
You marched directly up to your commanding officer... put a gun to his head and blew his brains out.
You were court-martialed and convicted of first-degree premeditated homicide.
You have since escaped from two level 5 maximum security prisons.
DNA scan reveals that you have a pathological aversion to authority... and a temperament... prone to violent behavior.
Congratulations.
You found a home.
I run a multinational business here, Mr. Robbins.
Basically, I take human garbage from around the world and I reprocess it.
I'm very good at this business because I make all the rules.
You will have no future contact with the outside world.
No visitors, no phone calls, no letters.
For all intents and purposes, you're dead.
But if you break any of my rules... you'll find that there is life after death.
Very painful life.
Was there anything you wanted to add?
Don't ever turn your back on me again.
Come on.
Thanks.
Here, it's food.
I saved it for you.
Go ahead, take it.
Come on, man. Quick! Quick!
No! Not yet.
Don't eat it yet! They'll find out.
They find out everything, man.
They know everything.
It's our electrical impulses that give us away.
The ones in the brain.
Lots of electricity up here, man.
They got computers in the walls... that process the impulses... and tell them what we're thinking.
So don't think.
Oh, no.
They're coming for me.
They know. They know.
- What?
- They're coming for me.
Relax. It's someone else.
- They're coming to get me.
- Relax.
No. That's what they want you to think.
They'll be back.
They're coming to get me.
Where are they taking him?
Absolom.
Where?
The killers are kings.
They sharpen their teeth like lions.
Human flesh is tough, you know.
They sharpen their teeth--
Quiet.
Hoarding food is a major infraction.
You are given enough to survive.
No more...
No less.
The punishment for this infraction--
Ten lashes.
Prisoner 2675... you will execute the punishment.
Nine more, please.
Begin.
Pick it up.
In five seconds, he's dead.
I don't think we know each other well enough for you to doubt me.
Now pick it up.
One, two, three, four, five.
Good.
Now begin.
T-One over Absolom.
They're requesting landing coordinates.
Drop 'em close to Sector Four.
Prisoner 2675 has been delivered, sir.
Good.
Stop!
Now put it back.
Good.
Isn't this beautiful?
Two-hundred deluxe rooms.
Heated outdoor pool and a staff... of caring professionals.
I'm sorry. I'm being rude.
My name is Walter Marek.
I'm your resident manager.
Welcome to vacation paradise.
I hope you take plastic.
We most certainly do.
We elicit all forms of payment here.
Now, I've taken the liberty... of scheduling a variety of stimulating activities for your enjoyment.
- Shuffleboard?
- Water sports.
Now, because some of the activities here can be extremely rigorous... we're very selective about our clientele.
We like to make absolutely certain they meet the requisite physical demands.
So, just to get that old heart pounding a little faster... we thought... five minutes in the pool with Ralph... our director of aquatic activities.
Enjoy.
That's extraordinary.
It's not exactly what we had in mind, but... extraordinary.
I could use a man like you.
A position on my staff, perhaps.
We appear to have an opening.
Think about it-- deluxe rooms, run of the grounds, free meals... anyone you can catch, kill and eat.
- How's your health plan?
- That really isn't necessary.
The average life expectancy here is-- what, six months?
I've been here seven years.
And what if I say no?
That would be very disappointing.
Listen, you gotta go, you gotta go, sweetheart.
I'm not gonna stand in your way.
- I could probably use the--
- I'll stay.
I'll stay.
If you promise to hire another lifeguard.
Yeah.
You want it?
Get out of the way!
That was a very silly thing to do.
Get him!
Let him go.
Bye.
- Yes? What is it?
- Sir, transmission from the island.
Code seven.
Prisoner 2675 is alive.
He's at the Insider's camp.
Lower your end!
You don't ever go in there. Ever!
Bring some more water!
How are you feeling?
- Okay.
- Do you want to sit down?
- What's your name?
- Robbins.
This is Mr. Hawkins, our chief of security.
- I'm known as the father here.
- The what?
"The father."
How'd you escape the Outsiders?
- What difference does it make?
- How'd you get past the traps?
What is this place?
Sanctuary, Mr. Robbins.
Most of the men here came before the Outsiders got so strong.
But you were the first to ever be captured by Marek and escape.
Not only escape... you came out with a very powerful weapon.
- Yeah, what about that?
- We've taken it for everyone's good.
So, how'd you get it?
Look, I've been shot, beaten, half-drowned.
I'm not in the mood for an interrogation.
- This is not an interrogation.
- Good. Then you do the talking.
We've created a new society here, a civilized one.
We are totally alone on this island.
But we have something the prisoners on the mainland don't have.
Freedom, a chance to make a life.
You are a highly resourceful man.
We'd like you to join us.
I'm not a joiner anymore.
All I want to do is get off this island.
Take him to Dysart.
Severe oxidation of the firing module.
Transducers require a complete overhaul.
Solenoid core, ejector rods, dial targeting system-- all completely shot.
The coil could be insulated with silk, if you have any.
Even flax from a corn stalk.
And the ejector rods will be fine after they're sanded.
- You appear to know your weapons, Mr.--
- Robbins.
- The new arrival.
- Mr. Robbins.
- How did you get it?
- I slept with the owner.
That's good.
Did you hear what he said, Hawkins?
Mr. Robbins is determined to escape.
Yes, of course.
You're on an island, Mr. Robbins.
They call it Absolom.
Situated approximately
200 miles off the mainland.
There's no warden here.
No guards, no cell. This is it.
We're on a peninsula.
Beyond those trees are the cliffs and the ocean.
The side open to the jungle is heavily defended.
You know the reason to that.
The Outsiders.
We estimate their numbers to be about 600.
There are precisely 98 of us.
The island is under constant satellite surveillance.
High-resolution optics, infrared scanners.
It's impossible to break out undetected.
There's a fleet of fully armed gunships stationed 50 miles out.
Once alerted, they could be here in minutes.
You call this freedom?
Under the circumstances... we use the term loosely.
I'm sorry, Mr. Robbins, but like all of us... you're here for the rest of your life.
You're not going anywhere with your leg like that, so you got time to think.
Because soon, you're gonna have to make a choice.
Either stay here and do your share, or take your chances out there.
Your feet! Wipe your feet.
The average bare foot has over 600 million germs.
Wow! So we're talking
1.2 billion, I guess, huh?
There's nothing funny about sinus infections, bronchitis... strep throat or pinkeye.
There's no antibiotics here.
No penicillin.
Jesus Christ, the nearest aspirin is 200 miles away.
Believe me, a bad case of pinkeye, and you're history.
Okay, I'll remember that.
Now, who are you?
I'm Tom King.
I host the newcomers.
You'll find everything you need in a drawer over there.
Now, I suggest a comprehensive oral hygiene program.
Trench mouth is rampant.
And do wash your face thoroughly before you shave.
A staph infection could kill.
Oh, and the father sent over some salve for your leg.
Nasty.
Why do they call him the father?
Because that's what he is to all of us.
Must be the dust.
Why are you following me?
Holy shit!
Don't sneak up on me like that.
I wasn't. I was just--
I heard you escaped from Marek.
No one's ever done that before.
I just wanted to meet the badass son of a bitch who did--
- Don't.
- Sure. Sorry.
Hey, I understand.
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
Just leave me alone, okay?
Absolutely.
Wet Dreams.
That's what I call this place.
Wet Dreams.
Sometimes I come here and I think about home.
Newark.
It's about 5,000 miles that way.
I used to think it was a real slum.
Right now I'd kiss the gutters.
Start swimming.
Are you kidding?
I got a problem with sharks.
I got the same thing with rats.
Wait.
Stephano!
This is my friend Mr. Robbins.
Don't touch him.
Mr. Robbins, this is Stephano.
Anything you need, he's got it.
Okay, I like the boots.
Here's the deal.
You sign 'em to me for what I call "merchandise on hand."
You keep the boots.
But when you die, they're mine. Okay?
He does that with everyone.
What kind of merchandise do you have?
In the inventory today, I got two dozen potatoes. Very few bruises.
I got five pairs of underwear.
They're real clean.
Size 44. Fruit of the Loom.
Yeah, okay. I got, um--
I got 14 disposable razors.
They're pink, but who gives a shit, right?
Hey, you a ballplayer?
You look like a ballplayer.
I got a first baseman's mitt.
Huh? You a righty? What?
What are you doing?
I'm trying to do business here.
- I found some rubber.
- I'm overwhelmed.
Here, take my sack... and bring it up the cliff... and quit bothering me.
Hey, I want this mitt.
Come on back!
I gotta have something you want.
Got a boat?
A boat.
I love those boots!
What are you doing?
No one goes out at night.
I don't take orders anymore.
We're all cons here.
We're all lifers.
And just like in the joint, we got rules.
You could've been an Outsider.
You're lucky I didn't kill you.
You think I'm lucky?
Count your blessings.
You know what I want.
Come on.
Don't be shy with that.
Beautiful.
This is my absolute, goddamn favorite.
This is good, ain't it?
Yeah, if you like roadkill.
It's not for everyone.
Why were you sent here, Casey?
The Weinberger Kidnapping.
You did that?
I was just a gopher. Drove the car, went for coffee, fed the kids.
We kept 'em in this little closet.
I kept telling the boss it's hard to breathe... but he had a million dollars in the brain.
I would've never hurt 'em.
I had a brother and sister their age.
Supply drop.
- What?
- Supply drop.
It's for the Outsiders.
We don't get any.
- How often do they come?
- Twice a month, maybe.
If you're thinking about trying to jump that chopper, forget it.
They pick a new spot each time.
We never know where.
Even if we did, who's gonna fly it?
Most of these cons can't even read.
- I can.
- What? Fly a chopper?
No. Read.
Mr. Robbins, I think it's time
I bought you a drink.
Mr. Killian!
How about two shots of your finest 12-day-old?
Piss off!
Come on. Mr. Robbins is new in town.
Give us a little taste.
Down the hatch.
Brain spasm. It's taken me years to get that effect.
- This stuff'll kill you.
- What?
- Mr. Killian is very sensitive.
- You call my life's work shit...
- It's turpentine.
- and expect to live?
You bastard! You get out!
Bastard!
I can whip your ass with only one arm, you know!
I'm sure you could.
Anybody who could make nectar like this
I wouldn't want to mess with.
We gotta go to the gate.
Everyone's gotta go to the gate.
- What's going on?
- A man fell asleep at his post.
He was warned.
It's the second time.
The rules are clear.
They've been established... to preserve the security of the community.
Any man who, by action or omission, jeopardizes the lives... of any or all among us... commits a capital offense.
The penalty is banishment.
Come on.
You don't approve?
You need my approval to kill a man?
- He broke the rules.
- And now he's gonna die because of it.
That's what happens to innocent people.
They're always dying for someone else's idea of what's right or wrong.
We live under constant threat from the Outsiders.
That man could've cost everyone their lives.
This is what we have to do to survive.
How long can you stay awake,
Mr. Robbins... without somebody guarding your back?
- What's the problem?
- What about the food from the drop?
You'll get it when I say you can get it!
Tomorrow, if you behave.
We're sick of you telling us when we can eat and when we can't.
Maybe somebody else should be giving the orders.
Really? Do you have anybody particular in mind?
What about the con who stole the gun... and gave you a bath?
Maybe we should ask him.
That's not funny.
Now that's funny!
They're gonna tear each other to pieces down there.
We better get our men together.
We'll make a raid.
Raids aren't gonna work anymore.
We need to take it all.
We need their land, their food, everything.
We need the other gangs.
Maybe there's another way.
Maybe we should just make it personal.
Just me and Dad.
Merry Christmas!
How are you doing, guy?
Hey, I made you a hat.
You don't have to wear it if you don't want.
It's a party.
We're having a party.
It's a Christmas party.
Come on. Excuse me.
Quiet, please. Quiet.
Will you be quiet!
All right! Okay!
Here we go.
Yeah, baby!
Thank you.
A lovely tree.
Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride--
Want to go caroling?
On a one-horse open sleigh--
Uncle Stephano shopped till he dropped, and he has a present for one and all.
These little suckers.
All right!
These little morsels of technology beat the odds, washed up here... and they're as good as they were the day they came off the assembly line.
Gentlemen, let me demonstrate.
Gentlemen... come and get 'em!
Look. For the long, cold nights ahead.
I won't be needing it.
Thank you.
Turn it down!
Another year is past.
The first for some.
For others, just one more.
No path to the island is ever the same... but we all share something-- something that cannot be taken away from us.
We have proved to ourselves... that we cannot be written off-- that our lives mean something.
We are not animals.
We are human beings.
That's our reprieve.
That's our pardon.
That's our freedom.
- Merry Christmas, everyone.
- Merry Christmas!
Now I have a toast.
To all our victims.
May they rest in peace.
So you're leaving us?
At daybreak.
How far do you think you'll get?
I don't know.
I'll figure something out.
Look, I don't have all the answers, but at least here you can have help.
You can have purpose.
You can even have friends.
Most people would call that a life.
I don't want a life with you people.
What made you like this?
Robbins, we're all guilty in someone's eyes.
Especially so in our own.
Maybe you can't forgive yourself yet, but eventually you have to... or you won't survive.
Good luck, Mr. Robbins.
Hey! What's going on?
A signal fire on the ridge.
The Outsiders are going to attack.
Let's go! Come on, move it!
- What happened?
- Somebody tipped them off.
Doesn't matter.
We stick with the plan.
- What do you want?
- Will you stand with me on the wall?
Get out!
Hawkins, there was a signal?
We have a spy in the Outsiders' camp.
Been there for over a year.
Robbins, do you believe that there's a god up there who's looking out for us?
There's something up there.
It sure as hell isn't God.
Sir, a strike force in Sector Four.
They're at the village perimeter.
What the hell are they waiting for?
Down! Get down!
- It's started.
- Any major thermal activity?
No. Just a minor signature.
Nothing that'll show up on a satellite.
You're sure?
It'll take more heat than that for someone to investigate.
- Choppers on ready alert, sir?
- No. Let 'em fight it out.
Water!
There you go, guys.
Excuse me.
Do it.
Get him out of here.
We wish you a merry Christmas
We wish you a merry Christmas
We wish you a merry Christmas
And a happy new year
It's been a long time, Dan.
God, you've done well for yourself.
You know that?
I'm impressed.
I am very impressed.
Really nice place you have here.
Hardwood floors.
It's just a stone's throw from the ocean.
With the price of real estate the way it is right now... you are very lucky, especially with a lakeside location.
This is a prime site.
You know?
I gotta tell ya, your security sucks.
Look at this.
This is great.
I really get behind on my reading.
I never seem to have enough time these days. It's a great shame.
I've always wanted to read this.
"Basket Weaving:
The Creative Choice."
Now I'm gonna kill you.
If I'd known you were gonna be here, I would've knocked.
Shit.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
Thanks a lot.
I don't know what happened.
I had him in my sights.
I guess I didn't load the weapon right.
It's okay.
They hit us like this two or three times a year. Sometimes more.
- Steal our food, loot our herds.
- He wasn't after food.
He was coming for you.
Maybe Marek's losing patience.
You'd better hope he never gets organized.
Once he does, he's gonna bury you and this place.
That's our problem, not yours.
Isn't it?
He's military trained.
You realize that?
And not just a soldier.
Navy SEAL, Marine recon.
Special forces.
Take your pick.
But somebody taught him how to kill.
The men we honor tonight fought bravely.
They sacrificed their lives for us.
And though they have surrendered all that remained for them to give... we must not pity them.
Their pain is gone.
And now, at last, their souls are free.
And when we reach for the fruits of their labors and find that gone... that's when we'll miss them.
Here.
Why did they let this happen?
The warden wants us to fight, wipe each other out.
- Why?
- Because he can do anything... he bloody well pleases.
You don't understand, do you?
This place is sacred.
It's private.
The prison authorities, they keep it classified.
No one out there even knows it exists.
If word ever did leak out, the public wouldn't allow it.
That's why they make sure it's impossible to escape.
As me tight-assed old catholic mother used to say:
"Alas, for Earth's sins, we shall pay."
And what sins is he paying for?
Why don't you ask him yourself?
He gave us our lives back.
He was a surgeon.
Still is a damn good one.
He had lots of money, big house and a young, beautiful wife.
But she got bored, started sleeping around.
That tore him up inside.
One day, they found her dead of an overdose.
He claimed it was suicide.
But the jury didn't believe him.
Gave him life.
What do you think?
Did he do it?
I think he's the only innocent man here.
Lying son of a bitch!
All this crap about a new society.
You've been planning to escape all along.
How much further?
It's 2,000 meters.
- Why aren't they stopping it?
- It's a specially designed craft... designed to evade their radar and their sensors.
It's got an internal cooling system.
- They can't see it.
- We don't know that yet.
There's a five-mile surveillance circle that surrounds the island.
They haven't crossed it yet.
What do you got?
The warden's dry cleaning.
Main gate.
Open it up.
1,000 meters.
- 500 meters.
- It's gonna make it.
Warden, transmission from the island.
Code 7.
It's out.
It's gotta be.
Come on! Move! Out!
You all right?
Shit!
It's possible the cooling system failed, triggering the--
- That's bullshit, and you know it!
- They were tipped off.
The warden's planted someone.
We've suspected for months.
Why do you think we've been so cautious?
For all we know, you could've been working for him too.
I thought you were supposed to be in charge of security, Hawkins.
- What's that supposed to mean?
- They're gone!
- There's nothing we can do about it.
- Who were they?
You don't know them.
They were in the caves for months... preparing, training.
Good men.
Well, now that I know,
I want in.
- I'm on the next boat.
- Who the hell do you think you are?
They're men that have been here years, worked hard, did the time.
Why should you get space?
You ain't done shit.
He's right, Robbins.
You haven't earned it.
Not yet.
You don't waste any time, do you?
The components are manufactured here... and later assembled in the cave.
Is this the one you're gonna be on?
No, Mr. Robbins,
I won't be leaving.
Thirty years ago...
I used my God-given talents to make a bomb-- a very powerful bomb-- for money.
I didn't believe in the cause.
Didn't even understand it.
I just wanted the money.
Fifty people died.
Now, I'm right where I belong.
What's this?
We've been working for years on the construction of a viable power source.
Power source, my ass.
This is a V8.
Yes, that's right.
It's an old Chevy.
Theoretically, it might propel a craft with sufficient force... to get it clear of the surveillance circle.
Hopefully before their informant spots it.
- Unfortunately, it's useless.
- Why?
We're missing one vital component.
In order for the mechanism to function properly, it requires a device that--
A distributor. Yeah.
Yes, a distributor. A simple, ordinary, garden-variety distributor... found at any auto store anywhere in the world.
Problem is, Mr. Robbins... we're not in the world.
- I want a space on the next boat.
- We've already discussed that.
Listen to me.
You've got a worthless engine because it's missing something. Right?
What if I told you I've seen what you're looking for in Marek's camp?
And you'll get it for us if it buys you a space?
Along with Casey. He doesn't belong here, and you know it.
You've been to Marek's camp.
You know and I know that you stand almost no chance of returning alive.
That's my problem.
I think that there's something you ought to be made aware of.
We have an understanding here that anyone who escapes gets the word out.
And risk getting sent back?
You think we take all these risks just to save a few men?
We have a responsibility to blow this place wide open.
And the boat is the only way for getting the rest of us off.
You've heard my deal. There's no conditions. Take it or leave it.
So you're going back to Marek's, huh?
How the hell did you find out?
It's a small town.
You got a set of balls on ya.
I'll give you that, man.
Of course, the smart money says... that Marek's gonna be playing jacks with 'em sometime next week.
I appreciate the support.
No, you can't have my shoes.
Wait a minute.
I'm shocked that you would even think that's why I came here.
No, you're gonna need those shoes.
You're gonna be doin' a lot of runnin'.
Then again, a strong, smart, tough guy like you... will probably make it back wounded and die here and everything.
- And then you know what will happen?
- No. What?
Everybody'll be fightin' over those shoes.
It'll disrupt the happiness of the entire village.
What do you want me to do?
Sign a contract for my shoes?
- Just initial the bottom of page--
- Get out.
Okay. No problem.
We'll make it a verbal agreement.
- I'll go get a witness.
- Get out!
Look, I've charted the safest route.
Just follow the line upriver to the falls.
Marek's camp is just east.
An example of an older technology... invented by Mr. Sergi Molotov a long time ago.
As per Sergi's original instructions, you just light it and throw it.
Okay, thanks.
Good luck.
- I wanna come with you.
- No.
- Please, take me with you.
- Casey, go home.
I can help!
Goddamn it!
I thought you were my friend!
Have you ever killed anyone?
That's what's gonna happen out there.
I'm gonna have to kill.
No hesitation, no conscience.
Once you do that, you're never the same.
- You're lucky you can't do it.
- You won't come back.
Casey, who's the guy who went up against Marek and lived?
- You did.
- That's right.
And I'm gonna do it again.
You're looking for a friend?
I'm the best friend you ever had.
Now go back. Go.
Sorry to keep you waiting, gentlemen.
I've been a little preoccupied.
I think it's about time we all patched up our differences, don't you?
Anyone who would like to disagree with me, please raise your right hand.
If you've got one.
Good. Very good.
As you can see, I've eliminated all the heads of state.
So from now on, we're all gonna be very nice and civilized.
No more gangs, no more petty squabbles, no more fighting.
I've been under a lot of stress lately.
So the reason for this is very simple.
I really wanna be in charge.
Good.
My.
You're just a boy.
Sweet, tender, adorable little boy.
Tie him up.
And I don't want him bruised.
And slowly, very, very slowly... they climbed up to the top of the stairs.
And then, the three little bears found the little boy... sleeping in their bed.
And they all said,
"Who on Earth could this be?"
And when the little boy didn't answer... the big daddy bear... ripped his arm off.
You are so cute.
But far too young to be out here on your own.
Where are your other little friends?
Are they gonna come by and say hi too?
Come on. Don't be shy.
You can tell your Uncle Walter.
Fuck you.
Welcome.
Same game as before, my friend.
Except this time with an itsy-bitsy little twist.
I think you're gonna love it.
First prize is a chance to live.
Second prize-- You really don't wanna hear what second prize is.
So please don't disappoint us.
We've all paid to see a show, given up our free time.
So if you refuse to fight, it's gonna be really boring.
And I'm gonna wind up having to jump in there and kill you both.
Now!
Go on!
You've gotta kill me.
I'm never gettin' out of here.
You have a chance.
You can save 'em.
Do it!
No! No!
You know, I am really trying to retain my faith in humanity here.
But you are making it very, very difficult.
You know that?
I welcomed you with open arms.
I treated you with respect.
I even offered you a position on my staff.
And what do you do?
You turn around and you make a fuckin' horse's ass out of me!
I hate it when that happens.
What do you think you were trying to do?
Think you were gonna kill me?
Is that why you came back?
You really thought you could kill me?
Shame about the boy.
Mind you, what you gotta remember is that nothing ever goes to waste here.
So tomorrow night,
I'm gonna have a little dinner party... and share him with my friends.
You're gonna die very, very badly.
Marek's got all the gangs together.
He's planning an attack.
You've got to warn them.
I'll signal when they march.
- Now go.
- Why are you doing this?
Redemption.
Now, go!
What?
One distributor.
Make it work.
The father fell ill... soon after you left.
- The men are worried.
- They should be.
Marek's gonna attack.
We start by fortifying the barrier.
We reinforce the towers.
Build a tiered layer of defense starting with a moat just beyond the gate.
What about mantraps?
Setting up a killing zone outside the barrier?
- That's good.
- I suggest we fill the moat with fuel.
I'm sure Mr. Killian will be happy to oblige.
High octane.
Double production. Right away.
And more weapons: lances, spears, crossbows, everything.
It's gonna mean more metal.
Tell your men... we're gonna need all the metal we can get our hands on.
We're outnumbered six to one.
Marek's united all the gangs, so if he wants this place... there's nothing we can do to stop him.
If we stay here, he's gonna kill us all.
What are you saying?
We abandon the village?
Let them take it?
I'm just telling you the facts.
I think what he's saying is we should just walk away... from everything we've worked for for the last 13 years.
That's bullshit!
I'm not walking away without a fight.
He's right!
What is the point of fooling ourselves?
We've always been about survival.
Whatever it takes.
It's the only way.
Mr. Hawkins, make preparations to abandon the compound.
What are you talkin' about?
I can't believe you're saying that!
Do it!
What about Casey?
Did he follow you?
What happened?
I'm sorry.
How close are you to finishing the boat?
- It's nearly ready.
- Finish it.
- What for?
- Just finish it.
I've been here for 13 years.
From the beginning.
I helped build this place with my sweat... my heart.
And I've watched a lot of good men die defending it.
And I saw for the first time in my whole miserable life... what a home could be.
I can't just walk out on it.
I can't just hand it over to those animals because nobody... is gonna be here to stop them.
Who said no one's gonna be here?
They said you were getting better.
I was lying.
I'm dying.
I have Hodgkin's disease.
It's progressive.
Without proper treatment, lethal.
Please.
Does anyone else know?
Hawkins suspects.
The rest will know soon enough.
For now, you're the only one.
I have a month left, maybe two.
But before I go... there's an important matter to be settled.
I want you to take my place.
What?
The men respect you.
You're a natural leader.
Without you, they don't stand a chance.
- That's not my problem.
- It has to be you.
I've known for years this day would come.
I didn't risk my life with Marek to stay here.
I have to get off this island.
You've got this terminal case of
"no one can tell me what to do."
You were a soldier.
You must have fought for something once.
Look...
I'm gonna take care of Marek for my own reasons.
- After that, I'm gone.
- Why?
You can't change your past.
That's easy for you to say, isn't it?
- You don't have blood on your hands.
- What makes you so sure?
I know what they think.
It doesn't matter.
My wife's death was no suicide.
If you go, at least take this.
This is my journal.
It's the truth about this place.
Give it to someone who will save these people.
All right, then.
Let's give it a try.
I was the leader of a helicopter assault on a village.
It was supposed to be the source of bio-weapons fire.
I should've known better.
I had a lot of combat time, so I should've known.
And it was too easy.
There was no radar, no air defense.
I kept telling him... but he ordered us in anyway.
And God help me,
I always followed orders.
We vaporized the place.
342 women and children.
And they covered it up.
We were losing the war.
The brass needed a big body count.
So they covered it up and gave me a medal for the victory.
And even after I killed the old man, no one would listen to me.
No one wanted to hear the truth.
And that's why I have to get back.
'Cause the real story is buried with those women and children.
I have to tell somebody what really happened.
'Cause I can't live with it alone anymore.
Let the truth come out.
All of it.
- What is it? Another raid?
- Looks like a major attack.
What about thermal activity?
- None so far.
- Son of a bitch!
You want it?
Come and get it!
What the hell's that?
Sensors are going off the gauge, sir.
Somebody will definitely read that.
Get me a chopper.
I want a fully armed riot platoon ready to go.
I got him.
I don't envy you going back to a world... that could create such destruction.
Six choppers fueled and standing by.
Platoon's all gearing up.
- E.T.D.: 12 minutes.
- I'm not waiting. Tell them to follow.
Tonight, we'll bury the father.
Tomorrow, we'll start rebuilding the compound.
Tomorrow, we start all over again.
Where is it?
Is this it?
Is this how you talk to him?
Is this how you tell him what he wants to know? Tell me!
Why?
He promised to take me off this place.
- He promised me freedom.
- I got a promise for you.
You're gonna help with the next boat, or I'll kill ya!
It's too late.
He's coming.
What?
The warden.
He's coming straightaway.
What are the coordinates?
Where's he gonna land?
The lower field, past the river.
Those coordinates are no good.
Tell him he needs new ones.
- Right?
- Yes.
Sir, we have a transmission,
Code 7.
Warden, the landing zone has a problem.
- What do you mean, there's a problem?
- The Outsiders.
They're retreating through that area. It's too close.
Come on. Let's go.
We don't have a lot of time.
Listen. The father.
You talked to him before--
What did he say?
He wanted me to go to the authorities.
He wanted you to take his place.
I'm gonna blow this place wide open.
You have my word on that.
- Pick him up.
- Six gunships are on their way.
- E.T.A.: ten minutes.
- I said, pick him up.
Liftoff.
Goddamn it, liftoff!
One, two, three... four, five!
Please!
We... We've got to go.
We've got to go!
No.
No.
We'll wait here for the choppers.
We can't stay here.
We've got to hide.

- How we doin' out there, Leila?
- Fuck you!
How we doin, my ass.
I'm totally soaked out here.
Aw, come on now, I pay you two bucks a day, don't I?
Get off your lazy ass and come and help me!
Cut me some slack, will ya?
I'm workin' hard too, you know.
Now what?
Son of a bitch.
Pantucci.
Ow. Shit, man.
[In Headset] I'm flyin' blind up here,
Brainiac. I thought you fixed the radar.
It's a little temperamental.
You have to be gentle.
Gentle, my ass. The whole system just cracked out on me.
- Killed off by your negative vibes, no doubt.
- No doubt.
Are you hitting that thing again?
No.
[Mutters in Korean language]
You know, where is it written that I have to go out there and work?
I mean, you know, Finnegan, why don't you get your ass out there sometime?
I love you too, Leila.
- Everything all right?
- Just peachy.
[Man]
We are on schedule, are we not?
- [Finnegan] You didn't hire me for my social graces.
- [Hanover] That's right.
We hired you for your reputation.
You better live up to it.
- Where are we?
- Right there. Middle of nowhere.
- And our final destination?
- Right... there. Middle of nowhere squared.
Finnegan.
Yeah, I heard of you.
But I thought you'd be older.
Like a fine wine, I'm ageing gracefully.
Thank you.
Like a fine wine, my ass. You look more like a keg of beer to me.
[Laughs]
Any questions,
Mr Finnegan?
Nope. I get paid to shut up and do my job.
So I shut up and do my job.
You're not the least bit curious as to where we're going?
Like the sign says,
"If the cash is there, we do not care."
Very good.

Ladies and gentlemen.
Mesdames et messieurs's.
If I could have your attention for just one moment, please.
On behalf of myself,
Captain Atherton and his crew... welcome to the maiden voyage of the Argonautica!
[Cheering]
Each and every one of the hundreds of men and women in service upon this vessel, has but one objective:
To make your dreams come true.
As for myself, my entire life...
I have had but, one dream.
To create the greatest most luxurious, most expensive, pleasure ship ever built.
And tonight, seeing all of you here... so beautiful, so elegant, so rich.
[Laughing]
I realize that my dream has come true, and I thank all of you from the bottom of my heart for making it so.
To the Argonautica!
Good times forever!
[All Shouting]
Forever!
[Percussion Resumes]
[Passengers Laughing, chattering]
This ship is so smooth we can't believe it!
[Captain] She's state-of-the-art.
Not another ship like her, ma'am.
She can hit a 40-foot swell and not even put a ripple across your Martini.
It's been very nice meeting you people.
I hope you enjoy the rest of the cruise.
Thank you, so much.
- Oh, excuse me.
- [In French] No, no. Excusez-moi capitaine.
Really very sorry.
[In French]
Au revoir
[Thunder]
[Scoffs]
Nice picture.
[Distant Wailing]
[Australian Accent]
I hate this bloody water stuff.
- That reminds me, I'm hungry.
- You're always hungry.
Yeah. So?
I'm a growing boy, you know.
- You're still growing?
- You got a problem with that?
- Be happy I don't eat you.
- So what you realizing, Mamooli?
Uh, well, that my goal in life before I die... is to make love to a woman from every country on Earth.
Like, countries acknowledged by the
U.N.? Or like, made-up countries too?
- What the hell does that mean?
- Like T. Ray's country.
Shut your face, Billy.
Australia's a country.
- Australia's an island.
- Well, technically, it's a continent.
Ah, shit, man. Island, country, continent. If there's women there, well, I'm interested.
You come to my country,
I'll shoot your ass.
Does he ever talk about anything else but women?
Nah, not that I recall. The only way to shut him up is to shoot him.
- Yeah, that's right.
- Yeah?
- [Gun cocking] You ever thought about it?
- [Man] Every day.
- [Knife Unsheathing] Oh, ooh, ooh.
- [Man] Come on, boys.
- Sit down, right?
- Oh, ooh. [Chuckling]
Go back to Australia.
- [Belches]
- You know what I want to eat?
I'll take a couple of nice, greasy pig's feet, some pickled monkey brains and one of them big elephant eyeballs, so they pop when you bite in to them.
- [Men Laugh]
- [Blowing Smoke]
Yummy. [Chuckles]
[Vomiting]
[Men Laughing]
You like that?
- Oh, man, that's disgusting.
- T. Ray, you stinking up the place.
Shut up.
Hey, knock it off.
You're not getting paid to party.
[Finnegan in Headset]
Pantucci! Pantucci!
You're not where I think you are, are ya?
Hola.
Listen, this radar's still funky. I can feel it, and it's a very bad feeling.
You know how many uncharted islands are out here?
- I know, two.
- Oh, that's very funny.
Wait till I crash this rig into some god-damned no name island.
What is this, a talk show?
I need some quiet time.
Over and out.
Whoa. Nasty.
[Hydraulic Lift Hissing]
Whoa.
Hit you.
Holy, shit.
"Holy, shit."
- I'm feelin' a real lack of love here.
- Get in there!
- [Billy] Ow.
- Well, what do we have here, fellas?
I found him snooping around the cargo.
If there's anything I can do to make your trip more comfortable, you come to me.
- Okay? - G'day, mate. [Men Shouting,
Pantucci Grunting And Groaning]
[Fighting Sounds in Headset]
Well, don't just sit there!
Go help him!
Are you kidding me?
Those guys are dangerous.
- No shit. You've got to do something.
- I find you live longer if you don't.
Finnegan!
[Punches Landing,
Men Laughing]
[Pantucci Moaning, Panting]
We got a contract, twenty hours out and back.
You beat my engine man to death, it's gonna take a hell of a lot longer.
Which is okay by me, since overtime will run you double rate.
He was nosin' around in my cargo.
Okay, so he's nosey.
Contract was, no questions asked.
Yow, fellas, I vote we kick this little piece of shit overboard.
[Grunts]
Well, I vote we kill him.
I vote we kill him.
Then we throw him overboard
Well, we don't vote here.
See, it's not a democracy.
Okay. I'll say it one more time for the hearing impaired.
[Billy Grunts]
[Guns cocking]
[Knife Unsheathing]
This could be messy.
Vivo.
Everybody okay?
Anybody gonna shoot anybody?
You know. You boys need to get out more often.
That's a year off my life.
[Thunder, Lightning Crashing]
[Computer voice]
Please enter your security key card.
[Computer voice] Good evening,
Captain Atherton.
- Good evening to you.
- The vault is now open.
Choices, choices, choices.
Oh, you're a big, bad boy, aren't ya?
Hmm... You're more my size.
[Clearing throat]
Good evening, mademoiselle.
Hello.
Red-handed. My God, what a cheeky little trollop you are.
Good evening gentlemen,
I was just on my way out.
- Or maybe not.
- A good decision.
There's no place to run. The nearest land is... what is it about, 600 miles, captain?
- Nearer 800, sir.
- According to this fax we received...
- Oh, that's not a very flattering photograph, is it?
- Let me see.
You're wanted for burglary, robbery, forgery.
Ohh... and attempted murder.
My ex-boyfriend.
[Canton laughs] What?
6 arrests, 5 convictions and wanted in 4 countries.
How does a beautiful woman as young as yourself a mass such an incredible record?
Trust me, it wasn't easy.
I think it's because you're not very good at what you do.
Hey, steady on, Canton.
No need for that.
Uh-uh! I believe that's my card.
- Thank you.
- Captain, do we have a brig on this ship?
Yes, we do, sir.
But it's not finished yet.
- You can't put a lady in the brig!
- True.
But you, mademoiselle, are no lady.
Hey, watch it!
[Sighs]
Hmm. And you, Mr Canton, are no gentleman.
[Pantucci moans]
They must be 30 feet long, man.
They're not nukes or nothing, but the bang sure would make your butt pucker.
You ever pull that shit again,
I'll kill you myself.
Hold still, you big dummy.
I'm sorry. It stings! Hey, do you think we could pull over?
You got anything to numb the pain.
Aw, yes, my little love bug,
But just a little.
- I think I need a higher dosage.
- You always need a higher dosage.
- Hey, Tucci. How many of those things are there?
- Huh?
I don't know. At least 8 or 9 of 'em.
Enough to sink a damn aircraft carrier.
This is just great. Now I got bombs in my basement.
You know, maybe it's just me, but if you'd ask a question or two before accepting a job...
[Pantucci] If the cash is there, we do not care.
What kind of life philosophy is that, man?
Torpedoes. What the hell are they gonna do with torpedoes?
[Computer beeps]
Yes!
[Hanover] Gentlemen.
Say hello to the Chinese...
M1 - L1 triple-pulse assault rifle.
Rotating barrel, thousand-round capacity.
- Auto cooling, watertight.
- Yeah!
Cheers, babe.
Mmm.
Mmm.
[Electronic Whirring, Beeping]
[Beeping continues]
[Crew Members Chattering]
What?
[Captain]
What's happening here, gentlemen?
Communications, what's your status?
All thermal and laser imaging generating a negative white screen response, sir.
- That's impossible.
- Captain, radar not responding either, sir.
Right. Switch to auxiliary power, Mr Lewis.
Let's do a circuit check.
No response, sir. We have a complete mainframe meltdown.
- What about the communications gear.
- Gone. All of it completely gone.
- Maybe it's the storm, sir.
- No, no. That's nonsense.
- [Canton] This ship is impervious to weather.
- [Captain] Can we still send?
Our signal goes all ecstatic, sir. I've never seen anything like it.
This equipment is state-of- the-art!
Top of the line!
Mr Canton, please!
We are in a very dangerous situation here.
Without radar or any form of imaging; we are sailing blind.
- No bloody way to communicate our situation.
- I have something here, sir.
- What is it, Colin?
- I don't know, sir,
But, whatever it is... it's big.
Probably just a pod of whales.
Moving at 31 knots, sir?
I don't think so.
- Where's it coming from?
- Directly beneath us, sir.
160 meters directly beneath us and rising very quickly.
150 meters.
110. 100 meters.
Ninety, eighty.
- Seventy, sixty.
- [Canton] What are they?
Fifty meters.
[Crashing, screaming]
[Woman] Oh my god.
[Passengers Screaming]
[Man] Open up!
[Woman sobbing]
[Metal Screeching,
Ship Rumbling]
[Squishing Sound]
[woman screams]
Hey! Who said you can put holes in my boat.
I didn't say you could put holes in my boat!
That's gonna cost you extra you know!
- What the hell is that?
- I don't know.
[Man]
Let's go!
Looks like some kind of...
It's a torpedo launcher.
- I... I don't like this.
- Yeah, I know. Neither do I.
- How much longer?
- Another 22 minutes, we'll be right on top of, uh, whatever's out there.
[Radar Pinging]
What the hell was that?
Hang on!
[Explosion and screams]
[Alarm Beeping]
Joey! Joey, talk to me! Damage?
- Yeah. We got a hole on starboard bow.
- Taking water?
A little, but it's
Just above the water line.
I got no power coming from Jezebel.
She's out cold.
[Leila] Something's wrong with Hercules.
He's not getting any petrol.
That's it. I'm shutting her down.
Shit! What the hell did we hit?
Get it off the cases!
What the hell was that?
Whatever it was, it nearly took my bloody head off!
[Laughing]
[Mamooli] What are you laughing at?
Cause we're alive you idiot.
A direct hit on any of these warheads and pfft! We'd be history, mate.
We got a hole in the starboard bow the size of Nebraska!
What's the status down here?
Old Jezebel got it right through the brain pan.
- [Hanover] What did we hit
- [Finnegan] You got me.
[Pantucci] - I think we killed the speed boat.
- Speed boat.
We're hell and gone from the nearest land.
There's no way a speedboat gets out this far. No way.
Ow! Shit, man! Finnegan, nothing works! Hercules is shot to shit.
His gears are all mangled.
His cylinder head seized up, I think.
We're leaking fuel fast.
I'll give us 20 minutes, half an hour tops, and then we're dead in the water.
Finnegan, you do something.
We have a job to finish, a schedule to maintain.
- Man, would you listen to this crap?
- Shut up, grease monkey!
You're expendable! You know what I mean?
Yeah I know. Story of my life.
Hey, get your asses up here!
There's something out there.
- What? Let me see. Let me see it.
- Could you just...
Whoa. It's a...
It's a cruise ship.
Do you think she can spare us some fuel.
And a few minutes in her machine shop.
[Together]
Absolutely.
[Finnegan] What the hell...
[Guns cocking]
We'll take over from here.
You know, Hanover..
A ship like that, they got half a dozen different ways to call for help.
Not any more.
Pantucci. Can you fix this thing.
If I can get into the Love
Boat's machine shop... yeah, maybe I can fix this hunk of junk.
She ain't gonna run pretty, but she'll run.
[Softly] They've armed all the bombs, man. They're alive.
All right.
Finnegan and the grease monkey will come with us.
Wait a minute. The three of us stick together.
From now on, you'll be sticking with me.
- Billy!
- Yeah, Chief.
Finish the torpedo launcher and watch the lady.
Aye, chief.
I'll watch her. I haven't done, Korean.
Hey, Mr Comedy, leave my girlfriend out of this.
- Get the fuck off me.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Behave yourself.
She'll eat you alive anyway.
Hey! Knock this shit off.
This is worse than high school.
Cruise ship's not movin'.
Why ain't it movin'?
I don't know.
All right, gentlemen.
- You know the drill.
- Okay, let's move out!
[Alarm Beeping]
Bingo.
[Finnegan] Relax, Hanover.
This is a cruise ship.
- You're not gonna need your guns.
- What if they attack us, man?
With what? Margaritas and tanning oil.
This place is a mess.
You want me to call housekeeping?
[Hanover] Use any and all force necessary.
The intimidation factor must be high.
There's a lot of passengers on this ship.
Yep. And half of them are packing lipstick.
Be careful you don't get glossed.
That was kind of fun.
Well, it was.
Everybody's in the atrium.
We'll pin 'em down there, then split up and finish the job. Sound off!
- We got the bow.
- Level six.
- Casino.
- Level three.
- Bridge!
- Bow, top level.
- Here come the party crashers.
- [Pantucci] I don't here any party
[All Yelling]
Everybody down! Nobody move!
Shit.
Man. Looks like somebody had themselves one hell of a shindig.
We got blood here.
We got blood here too, mate.
We got blood everywhere.
[Bell Dings, Machinery Whirs]
[Level Indicator Beeping]
I got a really bad feelin' about this.
The doors are closing.
Where the hell is everybody?
Well, the lifeboats, they're all still here.
Where the hell is everybody?
Let's go!
[Thunder Crashes]
Shit. Hanover.
Nobody home.
This place looks post evac, man.
Total spooky town.
Looks like somebody beat you to the punch.
- Where the hell is everyone?
- Who cares, mate? Let's hit the vault and go.
[Fizzing]
[Rapid gunfire]
Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa! Whoa!
Shh.
[Chuckles]
Fuck me, man.
[Both Yell]
[Gunfire Barrage Resumes]
[Hanover]
All right, knock it off!
I don't know what the hell's going on around here, but we've got a job to do.
- Machine shop.
- Sub level nine.
T. Ray, Mamooli, take Finnegan and the grease monkey.
Take the freight elevators.
They're the only ones that go all the way to the bottom.
The rest of you come with me to the bridge.
- Lets move, now.
- Come on.
[Moans]
[Groaning Sound]
What the hell was that?
[Sighs]
Whatever.
[Whispers]
Yes. Not bad.
Clear.
[Soft Beeps, Static]
The man did a good Job of shutting everything down.
Yeah. But he wasn't supposed to stop the ship.
- Or kill everybody on it.
- I don't see any bodies.
It's like... It's like everyone just... vanished.
[Metallic Rumble]
Hey, is that you?
[Water Moving, Gurgling]
Turn up the pump, you idiot!
We're sinking.
Relax, would ya. You're not the boss of me.
I'm the one supposed to be in charge around here.
[Water Lapping, Gurgling]
[Soft Snorting Sound]
[Leila Screams]
[Gasping, Shrieking]
[Hanover in Headset]
- Billy, Billy, are you there? - What?
We've looked all around, there aren't any passengers.
What do you mean no passengers?
How could there be no passengers?
- Have you seen anybody out there?
- Nah. I haven't seen anybody.
Only an idiot would be out in this rain.
[Screaming]
The hulls on these ships are supposed to be impregnable.
[Mamooli]
So what are you sayin'?
If the hull's impregnable, why are my feet wet?
It's a ghost ship. I vote we leave.
Who votes we leave?
Shut up.
Mate, that's it.
They thought they were sinking, so they abandoned ship.
Stupid bastards.
Oh, my God. He's right.
You're right. Yeah.
They all jumped overboard.
You know, I can just see the last, asshole in saying. "Shit, yes, we forgot the lifeboats, guess we're just gonna have to swim for it".
You got a real big mouth on you, you know that?
Yeah, I know that.
I don't like you.
You don't even know me.
Hey, check it out.
It's my future ex-wives.
[T. Ray] Mamooli, you bloody pervert, get your mind out of the gutter.
- Come on, hurry it up.
- Whoa, man! What stinks?
Did I say it was you.
[Mamooli]
Man, this water's freezing!
[Mamooli sings]
[Growling Sound Nearby]
Oh-ee, whoo. Mm-mmm.
Which one of you ladies wants to warm me up.
Hey, stay close.
- I didn't know you cared.
- I care about your gun.
Mamooli, keep an eye on 'em.
Mmm.
What you got there?
- Peanut.
- Peanut?
- Peanut.
- Okay. Peanut.
[Plop] [peanut falls in water]
Shit!
[Soft Growl]
[Growl]
Hey!
[Soft Growl]
Who's in there?
[Growls Continue]
You come out now, or I'm gonna kick your ass.
[Mamooli in Headset]
T. Ray, what the hell you doin', man?
[Growling]
[Splashing]
[Growl]
What is that?
[T. Ray Screaming]
T. Ray?
T. Ray?
What did you do.
- Huh?
- Hey! What did you do?
Don't shoot!
Well, what happened to T. Ray?
What did you do to him?
We didn't do anything!
- Touch that, and you're dead.
- Relax. It wasn't us.
[Loud Growling, Wailing]
[Trillian]
What the hell happened here?
[Beeps]
- [Computer voice] Please enter your security key card.
- [Hanover] Hey!
- Well, what do you know? Sign of life.
- With curves.
Excuse me. But, this area is for authorized personnel only.
As the assistant to the purser,
I'm afraid I'll have to report you.
- Where are the other passengers?
- I don't know, sleeping.
You tell me what happened here, or I pull the trigger.
- Who are you?
- Passenger. Just a passenger.
Name's Trillian.
And you are?
[Vivo] Thank you.
Makes my Job a lot easier.
- Glad to be of assistance.
- So again, tell me what happened here.
- Where is everybody?
- I thought you liked to blow things up.
[Recording] Good evening. The vault is now open.
- [Vivo] I do.
Yes! Money, money, money.
[Trillian Screaming]
[Hanover] Vivo!
Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa! Stop!
- [Captain] Jesus Christ!
- [Hanover] Son of a bitch!
- No, no, no, no!
- Come on!
Get outta here! Come on, get outta here!
[Canton] I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
You just killed one of my best men!
I didn't mean to. I-I-I thought it was one of them! I didn't know.
- Those are innocent people in there!
- [Hanover] Shut up!
Who are you people?
- One of who? What are you talkin' about?
- One of those things!
- Haven't you seen them?
- [Mamooli in Headset]
What's that?
Speak up, Mamooli!
- You're cutting out. Repeat that!
- Yeah, yeah.
Shut up, man. Listen!
I think T. Ray's dead.
Forget about that. We gotta get out of here. There's something down here.
Shut up!
Just shut... the fuck up!
There's nothin' down here but you and me. Hmm?
[Growling, Splashing]
Go on! Get the parts now!
Get the parts! Come on!
[Growling]
What the...
Mamooli! T. Ray!
They're everywhere. You hear me?
We've got to get off this ship.
Al right. Let's check it out.
- What about the vault?
- It'll be here. Grab, Vivo's gun. Let's go!
What the hell was that, Finnegan?
I don't know!
I didn't get a good look!
You get all the parts?
If I don't,
I ain't goin' back to get 'em.

Give me a chance,
I'll break the rest of your face.

That's what I've been trying to tell you.
There's something up there.

Do it.
Where's Mamooli? T. Ray?
- They didn't make it.
- What the hell happened?
He killed them.
You killed them!
- I didn't kill anybody. There's somethin' on this ship.
[Hanover] Bullshit!
No! It's not bullshit, Mr Hanover.
There are things on this ship!
You two know each other.
- Please stand clear of the door.
- T. Ray was my... you killed him,
Didn't you? You killed him,
Didn't you? Didn't you?
[Grunt]
- I heard you the first time.
- Stand down, you!
And you, tell me what happened.
The ship's infested. The bloody thing are everywhere.

Never seen anything like it before.

Come on. There's nowhere to hide.
Chick with the muscles?
[Thunder, Lightning Crashing]
[Canton] It was almost as if the ship had struck a reef or something.
It came to a sudden, violent stop.
And then suddenly they were everywhere.
Th-The passengers all panicked.
[Captain] Well that was so fast.
There was no time to do anything.
Couldn't even use the lifeboats.
Trouble is gentlemen, nobody knows we're in trouble. Couldn't send an SOS.
Well, then, mon capitaine. I think the first order of business should be to call for help. Don't you?
- Yeah, man, call in the Marines.
- Yeah, let's do it now.
[Captain] Look, you don't seem to understand.
- Something has jammed the systems.
- Not something.
Someone.
Who are you?
My name is Simon Canton.
I own this ship.
Hanover had a connection on this ship, somebody to knock out all the communications.
You two know each other.
- It was you.
- What?
Very quick, Mr Finnegan.
- Is this true, Canton?
- [Finnegan] How do we fix it?
[Gun cocking]
I said, how do we fix it?
Answer him.
Answer him, you son of a bitch!
[Muttering]
All the systems are melted at the core.
There's not going to be any calls for help.
[Gasping]
- For God's sake, man, why?
- Damn it!
This was supposed to be your life's work, I thought.
Ships gotta be worth, what?
Couple of hundred million.
Four hundred eighty-seven point six million dollars.
The insurance.
That's what the torpedoes are for.
You loot the ship, and then you sink it for the insurance.
I spent my whole life, my entire fortune, building this ship.
I'll be damned if I'm gonna lose it to a bunch of pencil-necked bankers.
Lose it! You greedy bastard.
What are you talking about?
The ship was up and running at full capacity.
I know captain. But, the problem is, the cost of keeping it operating is a hell of a lot more than we're ever gonna take in.
You mean, we're all gonna die because you screwed up on the math?
I simply misjudged the market.
What about the passengers?
Were they insured?
I may be a crook, but I'm not a savage.
The passengers, the crew and I would have been safely evacuated on the lifeboats.
Don't you get self-righteous with me,
Mr. Finnegan. I know all about you.
You despicable, lousy bastard!
[Grunting]
- You sold us out to the bloody insurance!
- All right, knock it off!
Do you realize how many innocent people you've killed on this ship?
- Hey, hey, break this up!
- Innocent passengers!
- [Hanover] That's enough!
- [Canton] Nobody was gonna get hurt!
- What?
- I like it.
Thanks.

What are these things?
Really unfriendly.
So, um... you got a boat waiting outside. Is that right?
- Yeah.
- Okay. Let's make a deal here.
You get me to your boat, and, uh...
And I can have whatever I want.
Yeah, whatever you want.
Can you get me a cold beer?

Hang on.
Come on! Pull!
[Captain Screaming]
[Growling]
Eat this, you wankers!
[Wailing Recedes]
What the hell are these god-damned things?
I'm beginning to fear that our friends here... maybe... some kind of strange Archaea Ottoia family.
[Pantucci] Huh, the Ottoia family.
And to think, I was starting to worry.
At 4,000 feet...
The Ottoia are about as long as a pencil... with bodies about the size of a golf ball.
But those at 20,000 feet... have been found to eat full-grown sharks.
At thirty or forty thousand feet... well, you do the math.
This, uh... this is not good.
Are we talkin' some kind of mutated sea monsters here?
Who gives a shit what they are?
Just tell us how to kill these, mother fuckers.
The Ottoia are very crafty.
[Canton]
They hide in burrows... and catch their victims with spiny tentacles, and then they-they crush them between massive jaws.
Yeah, and then they eat you, right?
No. They drink you.
They drink you alive, sucking all the fluids out of a body before excreting the skeletal remains.
All right. That's it, lessons over. Here's the plan.
Hey! I'm still givin' the orders around here, mister!
You stay here and give all the orders you want.
I'm gettin' back up to my boat, cuttin' it loose and gettin' the hell outta here.
Yeah, man.
I second that motion.
- Mind if I tag a long?
- Feel free.
[Finnegan]
Which way now?
At the end of this passageway, there should be an under-pass on the port side...
- that'll take us to the upper levels.
- The starboard.
I've got the blue prints to the entire ship right here.
Who do you think gave you those blueprints?
I ask you, man, could it get any worse?
[Power Surging Sound]
[Finnegan]
Thanks, Joey.
I can't get that song out of my head.
They must have ripped a hole right through the hull. That's how they got in.
The power of these things, it's... it's awesome.
- I'm glad you're so impressed.
- Shit!
- There's no way out through this door.
- It's buckled right to the frame.
- We can't go back the way we came.
- Okay, Canton, it's your ship.
Any ideas?
There are more hatchways and stairwells on the other side of this wall.
The only way out of here, is down those steps.
[Beeps]
- He's right.
- How far?
[Beeps]
[Sighs] It's 20 meters.
Somebody's gonna have to go down there and check.
I volunteer to wait here.
- Me too.
- No way.
I'll go.
But you're comin' with me.
- Good luck.
- And what are we laughing at?
If we make it through,
I'll fire two rounds.
That means it's safe to come on through. Okay?
Okay.
Hey! It's mine.
Let's give the lady a real gun, shall we?
You know how to use that?
Yeah. If something comes at me, I'll just pull the trigger till it goes away.
Careful with that.
It's got a hell of a kick.
I can handle it.
Well, if we're going for a swim...
I think it's your turn to carry the parts.
This is turnin' out to be one hell of a day.
[Gasping, choking]
- Come on.
- Up.
What the hell is taking them?
You know, a... I don't mean to sound like a pussy... but, this shit is starting to freak me out, man.
[Pantucci]
Can you just get asthma?
Or do you have to be born with it?

- Grabbed him.
[Mulligan]
No way this is happening!
This isn't bloody happening!
- Who's next.
- Now, where do we go?
There are more elevators through that hatchway over there.
Fuck elevators.
I ain't goin' up in no more elevators, man.
I agree with these gentlemen.
How much longer before we can expect a rescue?
I'm not waitin' on any rescue party, Finnegan.
We checked in Just before sunset.
It'll be another 24 hours before they start searching for us.
Wh... what Are you saying they're not even gonna start looking for this ship for another day or two?
Yeah, a... bit late by then, folks.
We got creepy crawlies swarming all over the place killing us off left and right.
Makes for a bit of a tight jam, don't you think?
I say we stay right here!
- Are you insane?
- No. No, man. He's right.
There's plenty of food here.
We can hold out until they rescue us.
They're right. This is the galley for the crew.
It was built to be almost entirely airtight in case of fire.
With these hatches closed, there's no way those things can get in here.
You wanna wind up in jail, Mulligan?
Better that, than in the belly of one of those things.
I don't care what you do, but I'm gonna keep on goin'. It's our only chance.
Back off! They are wiping us out, one at a time.
I say we make a stand.
Right here, right now.
The whole damn ship's infested, Finnegan.
We're not gonna make it back to the boat anyway.
I'm not stayin' down here, and that's a fact.
- Now, back off that hatch.
- I'll do it.
I'll do it. I swear to God, I'll kill you.
- I'm not mucking about here.
- Whoa, whoa.
- Don't get hasty, man.
- We're not staying here, Mulligan!
I say we are!
[Weapons cocking]
Last stand, hey? We'll kick ass and take names.
You back off right now, soldier... before I put you down.
[Finnegan] I once saw a guy put a fish in a bottle... and then he corked it and sealed it tight... and threw it to a baby octopus.
Now, the octopus, he felt his way all around that bottle... and in less than two minutes, he got the cork off, slid inside... and ate the fish.
And the moral of this story is?
We're the fish.
[Trillian]
Listen... the ship's already starting to sink.
What if they don't get here in time?
- I-I don't want to drown.
- Yeah.
Look, Mulligan, you can do whatever you want, but I am gonna get my ass to the surface, pray to God that my boat is still there... and those things aren't crawlin' all over it... and then I am gonna bail the hell outta here.

[Trillian Shrieking]
[Electrical Shorting Sound]
They're herding us!
They're forcin' us to go where they want us to go.
Wait, wait. Now you're tellin' me these things can think?
They're pushing us toward the bow of the ship.
What the hell is at the bow of the ship?
- Which way.
- This just takes us back into the holes.
That's the way up, through there.
[Panting]
- Are you comin', or what?
- Yeah.
I'm right behind you, really.
[Panting]
[Steam hissing]
What the hell is this?
Looks like some kind of feeding ground.
Looks like a dead end to me.
Where's Canton?

Oh, my God. They're breaking through the hull.

[Water Gurgling]
Hey, give me one of those!

Well, you didn't tell me to do that.
[Water Splashes]
You didn't tell me to do that.
[Growling]
[Screaming]
- Son of a bitch!
- Hey!
No, no, no, no! What are you doing? Come on!
I lost the backpack! It's got the engine parts to my boat!
We're not goin' anywhere without 'em!
Damn!
[Water Rushing]
Oh, shit.
[Trillian Gasps]
They're catchin' up!
They're catchin' up! We gotta slow them down.
The only way to slow them down, is to feed them.
Feed them!
All I got is a wet stick of gum and a breath mint!
Okay! All right!
What do we feed 'em?
What are we gonna feed 'em?
[Gunshot]
[Screaming]
[Roaring]
[Gasps] Oh, my God!
It's gonna sink!
[Chuckles]
It's going to sink.
[Thunder crashes]
An island!
Hey! Hey, did you see that?
Yeah, I see it! We gotta get to it! Come on!
- That heap of junk is your boat?
- You got a better one?
[Laughing]
Wait a minute.
What if those god-damn things are crawling inside it?
We'll have to take our chances!
Can your boat make it to that island, without the engine parts?
Not a chance in hell.
Then what are we doing?
Trust me!
I got a plan!

- And find the keys!
- Yeah! Yeah!
Make sure it's got gas.
[Thunder crashes]
[Grunts]
Okay, okay.
The key's gotta be around here somewhere.
[Beeping]
[Crashing Sound]
Did you miss me?
Quit screwing around!
Get to the engine room and get me any power you can, fast.
Not even a, "Joey,
I'm glad to see you?"
"Joey, what happened to your leg"?
Joey, you wanna be the appetizer or the entrée?
Right, right, right.
I'm on it.
Give me the parts.
[Mutters]
I lost them...
[Pantucci mocks muttering]
I lost 'em!
- You what?
- I lost 'em, okay? I lost 'em!
Go with the flow will you, Joey? I got a plan.
Plan my ass! Without those parts, this thing ain't gonna go more than about a city block!
Well, that's all I'm gonna need.
Now get movin', will you?
Leila?
I don't think she made it.
Right.
I'll, uh... I'll go see what I can do.
[Beeping]
[Beeping]
And kaboom.
- That ought to do it.
- All set.
But, we only got enough fuel for maybe 5, 6 minutes max.
Then she's runnin' on fumes.
Here goes nothing.
Come on! Come on! Come on!
[Engine sputters]
Come on! Come on! Come on!
[Panting]
Yes! Yes! Yes! Come on baby.
Come on! Come on! Come on!
Come on! Come on! Come on!
[Engine sputters]
Damn!
- Listen, you have to be...
- Gentle. I know! I know!
Come on! Come on! Come on!
Come on! Come on! Come on!
- Yes!
- Atta girl.
[Engine idling]
Bye-bye, baby.
Come on, man. Let's book.
Hello.
[Gasps]
Shit!
I'll bet. It's nice to see you again too.
Ah-ha-ha! No!
Now, give me that key.
[Thunder crashes]
- I'll... I'll take you with me.
- Yeah, what about the others?
Fuck 'em. They have to go down with the ship. That's how it works.
Now, give me that key.
Now!
Give me that key.
[Grunts]
[Shouts]
[Trillian Screams]
Son of a bitch!
Get in there and cut the engines.
Wait! Wait!
Are you crazy?
Just cut the engines, Tucc!
Do it now!
Wait! Wait!
Shit!
Give me that key, you bitch!
[Grunts]
God-damn it!
[Screams]
[Panting]
I've never actually killed anybody before.
[Scoffs]
Not on purpose that is.
Here. Take this.
Now... just, walk away and let me go.
[Chuckles]
I don't think so.
No witnesses allowed.
I don't think this'll be quick, but... it'll be interesting.
No! No!
[Shooting resumes]
[Canton screaming]
[Metallic groaning, crumbling]
[Gasps, crashing]
Oh, now what?
[Metallic creaking]
[Hysterical wailing]
[Roaring]
[Roaring]
[Gasping]
[Fierce roaring]
[Roaring continues]
Now there's somethin' you don't see every day.
- Time to go.
- Good idea.
[Screams]
[Grunts]
[Growling]
[Screaming]
Finnegan!
Aah!
[Grunting]
[Growling, roaring]
What are you lookin' at?
[Weapon unsheathing]
[Shrieking]
[Grunting]
Look out!
[Weapon cocking]
Get to the cargo bay!
Go! Go!
[Roaring]
Pantucci! Come on!
Let's get the hell outta here...
[Shrieking resumes]
[Gasps]
God. Finnegan, where are you?
[Thunder crashing]
[Screams]
Jesus, lady. Watch it will ya!
Shit. I'm sorry.
Thank God you're alive.
Damn straight I am.
Let's keep it that way, huh?
[Thunder rumbling]
[Engine idling]
[Canton chuckles]
No!
[Canton screams]
[Moaning]
[Groaning continues]
Well, that's a hell of a Jump.
Let's get up some speed.
Hang on.
Whoa!
Oh, shit!
Go, Finnegan!
Faster! Faster!
[Roaring, snarling]
Cock it!
[Shrieking]
[Grunting]
[Beeping]
[Beeping continues]
[Canton groaning]
[Screams]
[Finnegan grunting]
We gotta get outta here!
This thing's gonna blow!
Whoa!
[Snarling]
Oh shit!
Cock it!
[Cocking]
[Shrieking]
[Both cheer]
Whoo-hoo!
[Groaning]
[Beeping]
[Beeping]
[Grunts]
[Rapid beeping]
[Panicked groaning]
Hang on!
[Shrieking]
Shot to shit.
Where are you when I need you, Joey?
Hey, I found a souvenir.
Well, I guess we're stuck on this island.
[Surf crashing]
Well, I guess we're stuck on this island.
Better than a cold beer, huh?
Finnegan!
Hey, guys!
Joey!
- Joey!
- Are you all right?
Watch the leg!
Watch the leg!
- Watch the leg!
- I thought you said he was dead.
I thought he was dead!
It... It almost had me, man.
It came crashin' right through the wind-shield.
I ran out the hatch.
The thing was snappin' at my ass.
[Pantucci gasps]
I dove overboard, swam like hell.
Next thing I know, kabloowie.
And your damn surfboard almost cut me in half, man.
[Laughing]
Hey, was it the water in my eyes, or... did I just see a little lip action between you two?
Joey...
You know, I could always go for a stroll down the beach or...
- Joey.
- Go for a little swim.
Although, I gotta tell ya, if I never get back in that damn water...
[Both]
Joey!
Okay, cool. I'll stick around.
You don't have to beg me.
This looks like a... nice enough place.
[Beastly roaring]
[Snarling]
[Roaring continues]
[Finnegan]
Now what?
Young people from all over the globe are joining up to fight for the future.
I'm doing my part.
I'm doing my part too.
They're doing their part. Are you?
Join the Mobile Infantry and save the world.
Service guarantees citizenship.
The Bugs send another meteor our way.
But this time we 're ready.
Planetary defenses are better than ever.
Klendathu, source of the Bug attacks... orbits a twin-star system whose... gravitational forces produce an unlimited supply of Bug meteorites... in the form of this asteroid belt.
To ensure our safety...
Klendathu must be eliminated.
We break net now and take you live... to Klendathu, where the invasion has begun.
DXQ uplink on.
Two, one, you're on!
We've landed on what Cap Troopers.... are calling Big "K", with the
Sixth Mobile Infantry division.
It's an ugly, Bug planet.
A planet hostile to life as we know it.
Help me!
- Die! Die!
- Come on! Go!
- Keep moving.
- Get out of here now!
Oh, God!
Rico.
Pay attention.
Sorry, Mr. Rasczak.
Let's sum up.
This year we explored... the failure of Democracy, how the social scientists brought our world... to the brink of chaos.
We talked about the veterans, how they took control... and imposed the stability that has lasted for generations since.
You know these facts. But have
I taught you anything of value?
You. Why are only citizens allowed to vote?
It's a reward.
What the Federation gives you...
- for doing federal service.
- No. No! Something given.... has no value.
When you vote you are exercising political authority.
You're using force.
Force, my friends, is violence.
The supreme authority for which all other authority is derived.
My mother says violence never solves anything.
Really? I wonder what the city fathers of Hiroshima would say about that.
You.
They probably wouldn't say anything.
- Hiroshima was destroyed.
- Correct.
Naked force has resolved more issues... throughout history than any other factor.
The contrary opinion that violence never solves anything... is wishful thinking at its worst.
People who forget that always pay.
What's the moral difference, if any... between a civilian and a citizen?
A citizen accepts personal responsibility for the safety.... of the body politic, defending it with his life.
- A civilian does not.
- Exact words of the text.
But do you understand it?
Do you believe it?
I don't know.
Of course you don't.
I doubt anyone here.... would recognize civic virtue if it bit you in the ass!
Not here.
Come on. Let's see if they posted the math final.
- We gonna take Tesla?
- We're gonna kill 'em.
First thing Fleet Academy looks at is your math scores.
Wish me luck.
Way to go.
Good job.
Your turn. Hold on.
I want to talk to Marco.
His sister's at Fleet.
- Hi, Carmen.
- What'd you hear about Roxy?
She made pilot.
Thirty-five percent. Very nice.
Look at that.
Thirty- five percent, ladies and gentlemen.
- Big numbers.
- Carl.
Sorry.
So you haven't done it yet?
Don't lie.
- I'm not in any hurry.
- Others are waiting.
- Did you read her mind?
- Don't have to. I know what she wants.
Yeah, but I want Carmen.
Aw, you got it bad. Hey, don't forget about this afternoon.
He's always late when he walks you home to fish for a kiss.
Get out of here.
- Marco's sister made pilot!
- So will you.
I mean, imagine flying a half a million tons of starship.
You gotta have nerves of steel.
- You do. Let's see how yours hold up.
- You may begin!
Oh, come on. It's just a Bug.
Better put your goggles on.
Just a Bug. Ha!
We humans like to think we are nature's finest achievement.
I'm afraid it just isn't true.
This Arkellian Sand Beetle is superior in many ways.
It reproduces in vast numbers... has no ego, has no fear... doesn't know about death... and, so, is the perfect, selfless member of society.
But humans have created art, mathematics, and interstellar travel.
True, but before you let that go to your head... take the example of the Arachnids... a highly evolved insect society.
By human standards they are relatively stupid.... but their evolution stretches over millions of years.
- And now...
- Take this.
They can colonize planets... by hurling their spore into space.
Yeah, I think we got it.
There's the heart.... and here's the stomach.
Nerves of steel. Huh?
Don't think about it.
Just go on instinct.
Try to visualize it.
I see the ace of spades.
Statistically speaking, you should have accidentally guessed right by now.
Try another.
So, my psychic abilities are zero and I'm unlucky.
No, luck's not a factor.
No one really knows why some people are sensitive and some aren't.
Who knows? Maybe it's a new stage of human evolution.
That's why they do these kind of Federal studies.
Cyrano! Ah, shit. Time out.
Aw, he just wants some attention.
You don't play with him anymore.
Go bug Mom, Cyrano.
How do you make him do that?
I gave him the impression there's a grub crawling up my mom's leg.
He's on a mission to go eat it.
Get off my leg!
I sure hope you don't do anything like that to me.
Don't be afraid.
Can't do human.
Yet.
All right!
Touchdown, Tigers.
The score is now 41 to 38.
Tigers lead with 2:46 remaining here at the Buenos Aires Sports Arena.
- Time out: Giants.
- Are you all right?
- Much better now.
- Good.
Hey! Your helmet!
So, what are you doing after the game?
Everyone's going to the dance.
Aren't you?
- It's my last night as a civilian.
- Number 12, let's go!
- Ship off to Tereshkova tomorrow.
- You're going to the Fleet Academy?
- That's where I want to go!
- Come on, number 12! Let's play ball.
Don't get any ideas about my girlfriend!
All is fair in love and war.
- Giants! Giants!
- Johnny! Yeah!
Just under 22 seconds remaining.
All right, let's go.
Irving, Latham, cover the rook.
Perry, fake left.
Ricoli, you go long.
Rico, flip six, three hole.
Got it?
- Hey!
- What?
You're drifting! Flip six, three hole on one. Got it?
Just throw me the ball, Diz.
Ready? Break!
Two! Six!
- Climb left!
- Screen!
Go, go, go!
All right!
He's in there! It's over!
Who said you could grow up so fast?
Mom, don't get mushy.
This came for you today.
I presume, at your request.
A lot of my friends are doing Federal Service.
Well, you 're not thinking of applying?
Have you lost your mind?
I'd rather take ten lashes in Public
Square than see you ruin your life.
It's a term of service.
It's not a career.
I just want to get out on my own... see the galaxy for a couple of years.
Johnny, people get killed in the Federal Service.
Who gave you this idea?
It's that teacher, isn't it?
What's his name? You know the one I'm talking about.
Silly name.
There should be a law against using a school as a recruiting station.
Rasczak doesn't do that at all.
He sort of discourages you.
Well, that's good...
'cause you're going to Harvard and that's the end of it.
It's my decision, not yours.
- Oh, is that how it is?
- Wait, you two.
Dad and I have a surprise for you that will settle this.
Can you guess what it is?
You wanted to see the galaxy?
How about a trip to the Outer Rings?
Zegema Beach. Huh?
- I've always wanted to go there.
- Good. Then it's all settled.
Sure. Don't go away.
I'm just gonna go see Mr. Rasczak.
Hey, Rico.
You wanna dance?
Actually, Diz,
I promised Carmen...
Aw. Come on. Too bad for her if she's not around.
It's sad... after tonight, most of us... probably won't see each other again.
So, you still gonna play for Rio?
Yeah, looks like.
Unless Tokyo lets me start.
Well, anyone who gets you is lucky.
Johnny, how come we never got together?
Can't we just be friends, Diz?
Sure.
Look, Diz, I want to talk to Mr. Rasczak.
Well, you'd better hurry up if you want to catch him.
You're the best.
What is it, Rico?
I want to thank you. Your class was the best one I had this year.
Well, it's really not my job to please.
I just hope you learned something.
I want to join up. I think I got what it takes to be a citizen.
Good for you.
Go find out.
Well, my parents are against it.
I know it's my choice.
I was wondering. What would you do if you were me?
Figuring things out for yourself is the only freedom anyone really has.
Use that freedom.
Make up your own mind, Rico.
But I have not been to paradise
No, I have not been to paradise
Watch the days go by
All is well
Don't exaggerate.
You have really beautiful eyes.
This is Zander.
We know each other from the game.
- No hard feelings?
- Oh, none at all. We won.
Come on, Carmen.
It's the last dance.
- Maybe I'll see you at the Academy.
- Yeah. Who knows?
Good luck.
Zander's going for pilot too.
You two have so much in common.
Are you jealous?
Well, maybe.
You don't have to be jealous.
No, I have not been to paradise
Break it up, you two.
There's a place for that sort of thing.
I've been thinking, and I'm gonna do it, Carmen.
I'm gonna go for Federal Service.
That's great! Carl and I are signing up tomorrow. Come with us.
I will.
Talk about
Watch the days go by
My father's not home tonight.
All is well
Twenty-third century dies
Of my own free will... after having been duly advised and warned... of the meaning and consequences of this oath.... enroll in the Federal Service for not less than two years.... and as much longer as may be required by the needs of the Federation.
Fresh meat for the grinder, eh?
- So, how'd you kids do?
- I'm gonna be a pilot.
Well, good for you. We need all the pilots we can get.
- Hey, did you get Starside R& D?
- No.
- I don't believe it.
- I got Games and Theory.
Games and Theory?
That's Military Intelligence.
Way to go, Carl.
Next time we meet,
I'll probably have to salute you.
What about you, son?
- Infantry, sir.
- Good for you.
Mobile Infantry made me the man I am today.
All recruits report to the Federal Transportation Hub... within 24 hours.
Welcome to the adventure of Federal Service.
Let's make a vow.
No matter what.
We'll always be friends.
I'll go for that.
Well, chances are we'll never see each other again.
We'll be millions of light-years away from each other.
But, uh, yeah, sure.
Why not?
You'll resign.
That's all there is to it!
It may look bad, but if that's the worst you suffer, then that's fine.
- I won't quit.
- I'm telling you, you will.
You're not going back.
You're going on vacation!
I am not going on vacation!
I want to be a citizen.
- It's my decision.
- You walk out that door.... you are cut off, young man, understand?
All right! That's it!
You are cut off!
Johnny, why won't you change your mind?
Does citizenship mean that much to you?
Well, yeah. Sure.
I hope so.
I hope you don't ruin your life over some silly little girl.... who wants to look handsome in a uniform.
Don't talk about
Carmen that way!
Your attention, please.
Outbound troops 13-A...
Do you have everything?
Great.
- You're late.
- My dad h ad to help me pack.
Suddenly, he's afraid he's never gonna see me again or something.
It was sweet, but it took forever.
Anyway, I guess I'm ready to go.
$"Welcome To Federal Transport Hub 39"
Yeah, me too.
I'm wearing everything I own.
I'm sorry your parents were mad.
Who cares? The Federation'll give me everything I need for.... the next two years, right?
You talk to Carl?
Yeah, he left this morning.
Couldn't say where.
Oh, it's exciting going away.
But I'm scared.
Aren't you?
I'm gonna miss you.
I'm gonna miss you too.
I love you.
Outbound group 94-A, Tereshkova, all sections...
That's me.
Just say it once.
Try it on for size.
I love you.
- Don't forget to write.
- I won't.
N"A World That Works"
Fully automatic Morita.
Who wants to hold it?
- Me! Me!
- Citizen rule.
People making a better tomorrow.
A murderer was captured this morning and tried today.
Guilty.
Sentence: Death.
Execution: Tonight at 6:00.
All net, all channels.
Would you like to know more?
If you think you're psychic.... maybe you are.
Federal studies are being conducted in your community.
Every school kid knows that Arachnids are dangerous.
However, Mormon extremists disregarded Federal warnings... and established Port Joe Smith deep inside the Arachnid Quarantine Zone.
Too late, they realized that Dantana had already been chosen by other colonists...
Arachnids.
- One, two, three, four!
- Most of you will not live... to be in the Mobile Infantry.
The trouble is, you are not good enough the way you are.
Hands at your side!
Chin up! I am your senior drill instructor, Career Sergeant Zim.
Suck in that gut!
Feet together!
To think this had to happen to me. What a bunch of apes.
No, strike that!
You don't rate that good!
Never in my life have I seen...
Do you think I'm funny?
Do I make you laugh?
Do you think...
- I'm a comedian, son?
- I'm sorry.
The first words and the last words out of your stinking holes will be "sir''!
- Do you get me?
- Sir, yes, sir!
See that armory?
Run around it!
Run, I said!
- Bronski, keep pace!
- Move!
Now, any time you think
I'm being too tough... any time you think
I'm being unfair.... any time you miss your mommy, quit!
Sign form 1240-A, grab your gear and take a stroll down Washout Lane.
- Do you get me?
- Sir, yes, sir!
Pathetic! I wonder if there's a handful of guts in the whole bunch of you.
Now... who here thinks they got what it takes to knock me down?
Sir, I guess maybe I do, sir!
- You all right, son?
- Sir, yes, sir!
It's my arm.
I reckon it's broken, sir.
Medic!
Pain is in your mind!
- Who's next?
- Sir.
Recruit Flores reporting for duty, sir.
You specifically requested transfer from
Fort Cronkite to this training unit?
- Sir, I heard it was the best, sir!
- It is the best.
But what makes you think you're good enough?
Now, that's the kind of gal who makes squad leader,
That's my job you're talking about.
You know, I'd like to kill that Sergeant Zim.
Whoa! Improper attitude! They'll kick you out for talking like that.
Bye-bye. There you go, down Washout Lane.
Yup. Either you got what it takes, or you don't.
- Hey, there is a line!
- Wait your turn, Ace.
Hey. At ease, little soldier.
It's all the same muck.
Get in line like everyone else.
You got some guts for a rich kid.
I guess you and me could be buddies.
What do ya say?
I'm honored.
Of course you are! Everybody should have a friend like me.
Come on, Ace!
Back of the line. Man.
- What a jerk, man.
- Tough guy.
Hey, Rico.
Want to sit together?
No, thanks, Diz.
What's your malfunction,
Rico?
You are.
I joined up to get out on my own and you had to tag along.
You think I joined the
Mobile Infantry because of you?
You saying you didn't?
Forget about it, Ace.
You don't stand a chance.
What makes you even think you're going to make squad leader, Rico?
Something I've got you don't.
- You rich kids are all the same.
- It isn't about that.
It's about who's the best.
First squad!
Sir, I don't understand.
Who needs a knife in a nuke fight anyway?
All you gotta do is push a button. Sir.
Cease fire!
Put your hand on that wall, trooper!
The enemy cannot push a button if you disable his hand.
Medic!
Ah, well. We all have one thing in common.
We were all stupid enough to sign up for Mobile Infantry.
Breckinridge, what's your excuse?
My family's all farmers.
I hate farming.
Mobile Infantry? It's like pure picnic by comparison.
All right, so they grow 'em big and dumb on the farm planet, huh?
- And pretty!
- I like big.
- Djana'd, what about you?
- Oh, I'm goin' in for politics.
And, you know, you gotta be a citizen for that, so here I am.
- Ah, you want some responsibility.
- Yeah.
Shujumi! Come on, let's keep it going.
I got into Harvard, but my father says, "Forget it."
It's gonna cost an arm and a leg, you know? If I serve...
- Federation pays my way!
- I want to have babies.
It's a lot easier to get a license if you serve.
I'm going career.
Officer's training. All the way.
Future sky marshal.
All right, Rico, your turn.
- Who asked you to be so nosy?
- What, I'm the bad guy?
I'm gonna be a writer.
A writer's got a right to be nosy.
Hey, Flores. You know Rico from
Buenos Aires. What's his story?
He's here because of a girl.
Lover boy!
- He's gettin' me excited!
- He's gonna blow!
Is it you?
This is where we live.
Not much. But it's home.
Right there, that's my bunk, where I dream about you every night.
Boot's pretty tough. Sometimes,
I think I won't make it.
But then I think about what you're doing, and I try harder.
Do you mind?
We try harder, baby!
Who knows? They might even make me squad leader.
Uh-oh. Well,
I better pack it in.
- I love you Carmen.
- Write me!
I'm gonna kill you guys!
Bye! Write me!
Orbit in five, Ibanez!
First one there gets to fly.
- Locking it down.
- Wait! Wait!
Oh, no! Not Ibanez again!
She's crazy!
Ready! Go!
Deploying wings.
How come you're in such a good mood? Huh?
'Cause today I get to fly that.
Pilot Trainee Ibanez reporting for duty, ma'am.
- Take the number two chair, Ibanez.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Identify.
- Ibanez, ''T"-three-two-five-"A, '' clear.
What are you doing here?
I'm the guy who's gonna teach you to fly this crate.
Assistant instructor.
Should I call you "sir"?
Only when I give you an order.
- Prepare for departure.
- It's amazing.
Us running into each other like this. Maybe it's fate.
Maybe not. I heard about this crazy girl.... coming through the Academy.
Solid math, a little wild on the stick.... but a natural.
When it turned out to be you, I just made sure we would run into each other.
Rodger Young, cleared for undocking and departure.
All right, Ibanez.
Take her out.
All systems go.
In simulation, my supervisors could never keep up.
Well, this isn't simulation anymore, so take her out easy, Cadet.
Yes, sir.
Five meters from object.
Three meters from object.
Clear.
- Don't exceed port speed.
- Or what?
Or they revoke your flight status... and mine.
Your career is in my hands.
Steady as she goes, Number Two.
Prepare for warp.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Number One, design for Jupiter orbit.
All crew, all sections.
Stand by to cut in C-drive...
Stellar drive in... five. Four...
- Ready, steady, go!
- Three, two, one.
We're goin' in! Move!
Man, they're defended!
No way in!
- Flip six, three hole.
- What?
We run a flip six, three hole play, and you can score.
- Cover me!
- You got it.
Now!
- Thanks, buddy!
- Bastard!
The kid's got some moves.
Give him a squad.
See what he can do.
Someone's got to teach you guys how to play some pool here.
Look at him. You ever seen anybody so pleased with himself?
Well, Zim must've had to choose someone to be his brown-nose.
I couldn't have done it without you, Diz.
Friends?
Friends.
- Mail call! Levy!
- Yeah, that's me.
- Shujumi!
- Here.
- Rico,
- Here.
- Breckinridge.
- Here.
- Nyla.
- Yeah, here I am. Oh, great. My dad.
That's all, folks.
Hi, Johnny. I'm sorry I haven't written you sooner, but...
Oh, Rico!
You don't deserve that!
They've really got us going. They must have made you squad leader by now.
And if they haven't, tell 'em to talk to me.
See? All it takes is the love of a good woman.
Now, that is a woman!
Look at that.
Isn't it beautiful?
I love it out here.
That's also the problem, because...
I think I'm gonna go career.
I want a command... a ship of my own and, you know...
I don't think that's gonna leave a lot of room for you and me, Johnny.
Jeez.
I know that's not what you wanted to hear... but, uh...
I have to follow my heart.
I'm sorry.
Write me. All right?
Write me. So that I'll know we'll always be friends.
Funny how they always want to be friends after they rip your guts out.
Yeah. Well, that's what I deserve.
What are you talkin' about?
I joined up for her. I wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for her.
What are you talkin' about?
You made squad leader on your own.
And, hey, you still got me to kick around.
Fun and games are over, children!
You will be firing live ammunition in a simulated combat environment.
You will exercise extreme caution on my assault course!
- Do you get me?
- Sir, yes, sir!
Rico. Take 'em out.
First fire team with me.
Next team in ten seconds!
Maximum score has been 280.
I expect you to do better.
Go!
Stay low! Keep moving!
Shujumi, stay down!
Goddamn it, Breckinridge!
Clear my line of fire!
It's my helmet.
It's all screwed up.
- You're gonna blow the score!
- Man!
- Dumb shit!
- Diz, stay put! What's the problem?
Damn thing keeps getting in my way!
How come whenever something goes wrong, it's always you, Breckinridge?
- It must be 'cause I'm big and dumb!
- Yeah, right!
Medic!
Rico! You are relieved of squad command!
Rico, did you give the recruit permission to remove his helmet?
He reported a helmet malfunction, and I asked him to show me. Sir.
Are you rated to repair the M-3 tactical helmet, Rico?
Sir, no, sir!
Why did you order your man to remove his helmet during a live fire exercise?
Sir, I needed everyone in my squad operational, sir!
I wanted to win, sir!
Sergeant, we've already lost two recruits over this incident.
Think there's any possibility of salvaging this man?
Yes, sir, I do.
All right.
We'll try administrative punishment.
Prisoner, halt!
Bite down on this, son.
It helps.
I know.
For incompetence of command... for failure to abide by safety regulations... during a live fire exercise.... for negligence which contributed to the death of a teammate...
Recruit Trainee John Rico is sentenced to administrative punishment.
Ten lashes.
You may carry out the sentence.
One!
Two!
Three!
Four!
Five!
Six!
Seven!
Eight!
Nine!
Ten!
All structures secure. EB X is high-normal. Switch to slave on my mark.
Thanks. You read my mind.
Oh, third watch always seems to last forever.
I don't know. Depends on who you're spending it with.
Something's wrong.
- There!
- No.
I replotted the course.
It's more efficient this way.
Three weeks aboard a starship and you think you can lick my navs?
Check it.
You know, I was talking with
Captain Deladier and, uh, she said...
Don't change the subject.
Am I right?
Yeah. You're right.
So, what did the captain say?
She thinks we should team up officially... and crew for her.
- You and me, huh?
- We're good together, Carmen.
We're way ahead of the curve in every department.
I can anticipate you.
You know what I want.
No. What do you want?
There's a gravity field out there.
- Run a scan. Sensors on.
- There.
- Gravity at two- two-five and rising.
- Report!
We are in the path of an unidentified object moving toward us at high speed.
Profile suggests an asteroid, ma'am.
Impact: six seconds!
Emergency evasion!
Three.... two... fire!
Close compartment 21!
Where'd it come from?
It came out of the
Arachnid Quarantine Zone, ma'am.
Number Four, contact Fleet. Tell them a loose asteroid's headed their way.
Communications are down, ma'am.
They're gone.
Damage assessment!
Hull's compromised.
We're lucky to be alive, ma'am.
Luck didn't have anything to do with it.
We have a hell of a flight team.
It really stinks, you goin'.
Yeah, well, the Mobile Infantry'll just have to get along without me.
I don't get it.
You took your licks. If they didn't want you, they would've kicked you out.
I joined up for the wrong reasons.
I got a guy killed.
I figure that kinda proves
I don't have what it takes.
Your call's goin' through.
Take it there.
- Hi, Mom.
- Bill, pick it up. It's Johnny.
- Dad.
- Where's your uniform?
It's just good to hear from you. How are you, son?
It's not really working out here for me, Dad.
I was thinking... I was hoping it would be all right if I came home.
Well, of course. You should come home immediately.
- I'm sorry. I've been an idiot.
- Don't say that. Just come on home.
We'll talk things out.
We love you, son.
- My, what's that?
- Looks like rain.
- This time of the year?
- Sure is dark...
Your transmission has been terminated due to atmospheric interference.
Please try your call again later.
I'II see ya.
You take that stroll down Washout Lane.
You're only proving one thing.
What's that, Diz?
That you don't have what it takes to be a citizen.
- Sound off.
- Stand by.
Left, right, left!
Hold it! What's happening?
We got bombed!
Lost the whole city!
Hey, what's goin' on?
- Hey, Kitten, what's goin' on?
- War! We're goin' to war!
The devastation we are seeing is un paralleled.
Judging from early estimates, millions dead, a city in ruins.
Is that Geneva?
Goddamn Bugs whacked us, Johnny.
The meteor was shot out of orbit by Bug plasma... that derived from Klendathu.
The Arachnid's home planet.
Nothing lives in what was once called... the Latin paradise.
Oh, Johnny, that's us.
Buenos Aires has been wiped off the Earth.
It's home.
The Federal Council met moments ago and voted unanimously... for mobilization to destroy the Arachnid threat.
- I'm serious. I'll go anywhere.
- Forget it, Zim. We need you here.
- I want combat, sir!
- The only way you'll see combat... is if you bust yourself to private. Get me?
Yes, sir. I get you.
- Sir!
- What do you want, Rico?
I wish to reconsider my request to drop out, sir.
You already signed your 1240-A.
- It wouldn't be legal.
- Major, I know it was wrong.
I didn't learn from one mistake.
And I made another. Sir.
You made your decision, son.
Sir, my family... my whole family.... was in Buenos Aires, sir.
Is this your signature, Rico?
Sir, yes, it is, sir!
Doesn't look like it to me.
Carry on, Private.
Out of the ashes of Buenos Aires comes first sorrow... then anger.
The only good Bug is a dead Bug!
In Geneva.
The Federal Council convenes.
We must meet the threat.... with our valor, our blood... indeed with our very lives... to ensure that human civilization.
Not insect.... dominates this galaxy now and always.
Sky Marshall Dienes announces plans for an offensive against Klendathu... source of the Bug meteor that destroyed Buenos Aires.
Every day, federal scientists... are looking for new ways to kill Bugs.
Your basic Arachnid warrior isn't too smart... but you can blow off a limb.... and it's still 86% combat effective.
Here's a tip: Aim for the nerve stem and put it down for good.
Would you like to know more?
Everyone's doing their part. Are you?
The war effort needs your effort at work, at home, in your community.
We now break net and take you live... to Fleet Battle Station Ticonderoga deep inside... the Arachnid Quarantine Zone, where the men and women... of the Federal Armed Services prepare to attack.
DXQ uplink on two, one.
You're on.
No one here in the AQZ knows when the invasion of Klendathu will occur... but everyone's talking about it, and the talk says tomorrow.
Here's a bunch of M.I. Kids who look like they eat Bugs for lunch.
Yum, yum, yum.
So, trooper, you're not too worried about fighting the Arachnids?
Shoot a nuke down a Bug hole, you got a lot of dead Bugs. Am I right?
I just hope it's not over before we get some.
Some say the Bugs were provoked by the intrusion of humans... into their natural habitat... that a "live and let live" policy is preferable to war with the Bugs.
Let me tell you something.
I'm from Buenos Aires... and I say kill 'em all!
Big bad Bugs, huh?
- Hey, guys, we ought to get tattoos.
- Let's all get cut together.
- What do I want a tattoo for?
- What? Your skin's too pretty?
Come on. Everybody's doing it.
At ease. Guess I ought to lose the hat when I'm off duty.
My mother was right about you.
- You look great in a uniform.
- You look pretty good yourself.
So, what do you hear? You know about anyone who made it out of B.A. Alive?
Most of the time,
I don't think about it.
Like it happened to someone else.
Then it hits me, and I can't stop crying.
Well, we're still alive.
You've got to be happy about that.
You don't look very happy to see me.
Should I be?
Johnny, it's different now.
We're at war.
I think what I did was probably... the best thing for both of us.
Everything coposetic, Lieutenant?
Zander, you remember Johnny?
Zander and I are a flight team now.
We're the best in the Fleet.
I get it. This is the part that's best for both of us.
Don't do me any more favors.
- Johnny, wait.
- For get it. He's Mobile Infantry.
See, when you're trained to kill, it just doesn't pay to be polite.
You got something to say about the Mobile Infantry?
I think you heard me.
You wanna make something of it, Private?
Not with an officer. No, sir,
The M.I. Doesn't mint stupid troopers.
- Well, let's disregard rank.
- Zander, please.
Everybody hear that?
Rank is not an issue here.
- Don't do this.
- Come on. What's he gonna do?
I'm gonna kill you!
Quit it! He's not worth it!
Forget it, Rico.
Mobile Infantry and Fleet don't mix.
Come on, let's go.
Jarheads!
Mobile Infantry rules!
Oh, God, that hurts!
Well, I got something that might hurt just a little bit more, buddy.
Oh, yeah! We're gonna fight!
And we're gonna win!
This is the captain.
All personnel prepare for drop.
We are at ''D'' minus three and counting.
We are going in with the first wave.
Means more Bugs for us to kill.
You smash the entire area. Kill anything that has more than two legs.
- You get me?
- We get you, sir!
- Plasma, ma'am, from the planet.
- Bug batteries.
According to Military Intelligence, it'll be random and light.
- Drop status?
- Drop is 35% complete, ma'am,
Steady as she goes, Number Two.
Remember your training and you will make it back alive!
This isn't random or light.
Someone made a mistake.
That's it. We're empty, ma'am.
Someone made a big goddamn mistake!
Break for high orbit!
- Rocket's up!
- Rocket crew, move up!
Nuke 'em!
- Levy, Rico!
- Heat 'em up.
You're set.
Fire!
- Follow me!
- Let's go!
First Platoon, left flank!
Spread out!
First and second squads, follow me!
Fire!
Here they come!
- Ace, what are we doing?
- I don't know.
I don't know!
Kill them! Kill them all!
Come on!
Come on! You want some?
Here's some! Yeah!
Take some of this!
Oh, my God!
Let's get out of here!
Fall back!
What's going on?
- You got com?
- It's a general retreat!
Back to the boats!
We've just landed here on what cap troopers are calling the Big "K"... with the Sixth Mobile Infantry Division.
It's an ugly planet, a Bug planet... a planet hostile to life as we...
Help me!
Come on! Go!
Get out of here, now!
Crisis for humankind.
Fleet officials admit they underestimated... the Arachnid's defensive capability.
Accepting responsibility for Klendathu...
Sky Marshall Dienes resigns.
His successor,
Sky Marshall Tahat Meru... outlines her new strategy.
To fight the Bug.... we must understand the Bug.
We can ill afford another Klendathu.
Would you like to know more?
Federal scientists struggle to explain... the intelligent military actions of the Arachnids.
When a colony reaches a certain size... three hundred generations or something... it gets smarter.
Insects with intelligence?
Have you ever met one?
I can't believe
I am hearing this nonsense!
This is the most ridiculous conversation I have ever had!
Maybe there is some kind of Bug that we haven't seen yet... a leadership caste of hive brains!
Brain Bugs?
Frankly, I find the idea... of a Bug that thinks offensive.
Ticonderoga, this is Rodger Young requesting approach vector.
Affirmative, Rodger Young.
One-zero-zero-niner-five-two.
Welcome back.
My God!
How could this happen?
We thought we were smarter than the Bugs.
It's strange.
There's almost no wounded at all.
Bugs don't take prisoners.
Oh, no!
- There he is,
- Come on. Let's wake him up.
- Wake up!
- How you doing, fish boy? Look!
- You're dead!
- Killed in action!
Three more days and you're out.
Good as new.
- See ya later.
- Bye.
What did you hear about our new unit?
Roughnecks killed more Bugs than any other outfit on Big "K".
I hear the lieutenant's a real nut-buster.
Who's top kick?
You want the job, huh?
- I wouldn't mind.
- I would.
- Just doing my part.
- Orders.
Yours?
- Where you been besides Big "K"?
- Outer Rings. Zegema Beach.
- I always wanted to go there.
- Good luck. It's not there anymore.
So I hear your lieutenant's a real nut-buster.
No one talks about the lieutenant that way.
- He saved my life.
- Mine too.
- Same for me.
- Me too.
Well, sounds like he's quite a guy.
Who do you think saved your ass?
Stand by!
Attention on deck!
This is for you new people.
I only have one rule.
Everyone fights. No one quits.
You don't do your job, I'll shoot you.
You get me?
We get you, sir!
- Welcome to the Roughnecks.
- Rasczak's Roughnecks!
At ease! Listen up!
Got a new sky marsh all and a new battle plan.
We're gonna clean out the system's outlying Klendathu.... one planet at a time.
Tomorrow we hit Tango Urilla.
After Fleet glasses the planet,
M. I. Mops up.
Carry on,
All right.
Spread out! Fire teams!
You locate a Bug hole, nuke it.
Watkins. Take out Flores and Rico.
Copy that. Move out!
First Platoon.
We're going for that ridge.
- Levy, with me.
- No, I'm going with Rico.
Shut up and follow me!
Like it like that?
It's dead, Watkins!
Ain't much to look at after you scrape 'em off your boot.
Bug hole.
There.
Nuke 'em, Rico!
Fire in the hole!
- Get over here!
- Move!
- You got a Bug problem, ma'am?
- Stow it, Trooper!
- Oh, shit!
- Come on, move!
Get down!
- Call for retrieval.
- Medic!
Nice moves.
Where did you learn how to do that?
Back in school, sir.
Don't you remember?
I was captain of the team.
- Rico?
- Sir?
I need a corporal. You're it, until you're dead or I find someone better.
Thank you, sir.
- Saddle up!
- Way to go, Corporal!
- I need a squad leader.
- Oh, no.
I've been there and blew it.
I'm just here to fight.
What about it. Diz?
Looks like I'm your girl, sir.
Listen up!
I expect the best, and I give the best!
Here's the beer!
Here's the entertainment!
Have fun! That's an order!
Thank you, Lieutenant!
You kill Bugs good.
Thanks.
You knew the lieutenant before the war.
What was he like?
He was a teacher.
Kind of like he knew it all.
He always had this little smile.
Well, he don't smile much anymore.
Well, I guess your bottle fills up real quick when your kids get smeared.
- Come on, Corporal.
- I don't do that anymore.
I remember when you used to dance.
Come on.
Do I have to pull rank?
Excuse me, sir.
You once asked me for advice.
Want some now?
- Yes, sir.
- Lieutenant.
HQ is on the com.
Never pass up a good thing.
Beer?
So, Rico, what are you doing after the dance?
What's so funny?
You know, just the way things work out.
We finally got together, Diz.
I love you, Johnny.
We're moving out. There's been a distress call from planet "P".
So get your shit wired and report in ten minutes.
- Yes, sir.
- Who's that with you?
Flores, sir.
- Make it 20 minutes.
- Yes, sir.
Twenty minutes?
We can do it.
Whiskey to Outpost. Do you copy? This is Roughneck Two- Zero on tack three.
Come in, please?
- Any contact with General Owen?
- No, sir.
- Not even the transponder signal.
- It's these canyons.
Go to higher ground, Sergeant.
Sugar, your weapon.
I'd expect anyone in this unit to do the same for me.
You're acting sergeant. Move 'em out.
You heard the lieutenant! Saddle up!
Someone really humped the bunk.
- Watkins?
- Sir?
Secure this compound.
Police these bodies.
Yes. Sir.
Give me three up on the tower, now!
O. P. There! O. P. There!
Siren Two, police up these bodies!
It stinks in there.
- Rico?
- Yes, sir?
We need retrieval. This place crawls.
Get somebody in a communications tent and get me an uplink.
- Diz, check it out.
- Man group with me.
Lieutenant!
Dirty Bugs came in right when they were having chow.
This is where they got in.
I think you're gonna wanna see this.
- What have you got, Flores?
- God, I hate this pl ace.
What's that look like to you, Rico?
Looks like a Bug was in his brain.
They sucked his brains out.
Open that.
Officer on the deck!
Pick up the general.
Is it safe?
We've got to get out of here!
Sir!
Thank God for you. All of you.
You're all gonna be heroes, every last one of you.
- Close that hole.
- Yes. Sir.
I had to evade capture. The security of the Federation was at stake.
I have operational knowledge of what we're up to out here.
- I need that uplink.
- Working on it, sir.
- Damn it!
- See?
They get in your mind.
Look, they did it to Farley.
They got into his mind.
They make you do things.
- They made Farley call headquarters.
- The distress call was a trap.
They're just like us.
They want to know what makes us tick.
They wanna know us so they can kill us.
Roughnecks, this is Lead.
Prepare for attack.
- We're gonna be attacked.
- Where's the retrieval boat?
Mayday. This is Roughneck Two-Zero to Battle Group. Do you read?
Oh, God! We're gonna die!
Don't you understand?
We're all gonna die!
- Control yourself, General.
- I can't!
I can't!
I wish you'd just shoot me.
He's just a little out of his mind, sir.
Bugs!
Bugs!
- Die!
- All right.
Warm it all up!
Everything you've got!
Come on, you apes!
You wanna live forever?
I got Bugs!
Magazine!
Fire at will!
Incoming!
Rico! Where's my communications?
- Diz, status on the uplink?
- Give me a minute.
We don't have a minute!
Battle Group, this is Roughneck Two-Zero.
- This is Rodger Young. Go ahead.
- We are under attack, sir!
- We need retrieval now!
- We have Planet "P'' as clear.
This place crawls, sir.
We need pickup now!
- What's your position?
- Come down on this transmission.
- The Outpost? That's crazy!
- I hope you have a crazy pilot! Out!
Lieutenant! Boat coming down, sir!
Fall back into the compound!
Fall back!
Hold here! Hold what you got!
Running low!
- I'm out!
- Here! Make 'em count!
Take cover and fire! Fall back!
Move!
Fall back to the boats! Haul ass!
- You know what to do!
- Yes, sir!
Do it, Rico!
Ace, help me! Hold her down!
Move! Get her into the boat!
- Come on, Diz! Don't die on me!
- Get her out! Let's go!
Let's go! Get aboard!
Tower, let's go!
Let's move it. Tower!
Lift off!
I'm dying.
No. You're gonna be all right.
It's all right... because I got to have you.
Johnny, don't let me go!
This is Battle Control. Proceed on vector five-niner-two-two-seven.
I think you should know... your friend Rico is back there.
Get on the com and tell Fleet to blast that rock.
On whose authority, Corporal?
That would be mine, sir.
I assumed command of the mission.
Rodger Young, we have an official request.... by the Mobile Infantry to commence bombardment of planet "P."
I thought you were dead.
I'm not, but a lot of my troopers are.
Negative on your request.
The sky marshall... has other plans for planet "P."
Welcome back.
M. I. does the dying, and Fleet just does the flying.
Hold on. Something's up.
Fleet's mobilized for a big operation.
Attention on deck!
Once, somebody asked me... if I knew the difference between a citizen and a civilian.
I can tell you now.
A citizen has the courage... to make the safety of the human race their personal responsibility.
Dizzy was my friend.
She was a soldier... but more than that... she was a citizen of the Federation.
Present arms!
Order arms!
Left face!
- Officer on deck.
- Carry on.
Burial detail, dismissed.
- At ease.
- How are you, Carl?
Carmen, good.
Johnny, I'm sorry it had to be your unit on "P."
That mission had a very low survival probability.
The Bugs I aid a trap for us, didn't they?
Elegant proof of intelligence, isn't it?
We thought there might be a Brain Bug on "P."
You knew, and you sent them anyway?
We couldn't afford to launch an operation if there wasn't one.
You don't approve.
Well, too bad.
We're in this for the species, boys and girls. It's simple numbers.
They have more, and every day...
I have to make decisions that send hundreds of people to their deaths.
Didn't they tell you, Colonel?
That's what the Mobile Infantry's good for.
I hope you're ready for more.
We're going back to "P" to capture that Brain.
The Roughnecks are always ready, sir.
I hear they need a new lieutenant.
Want the job?
I'll take it, until I get killed or you find someone better.
Well?
Take care of yourself.
I'll see you again.
Officer on deck!
- Who are all these kids?
- We got reinforced.
Most of them are fresh out of boot.
We're the old men, Ace.
This is for all you new people.
I only have one rule.
Everyone fights. No one quits.
You don't do your job,
I'll kill you myself.
- Do you get me?
- We get you, sir!
- Welcome to the Roughnecks.
- Rico's Roughnecks!
Today we're gonna pay a visit to Bug City.
We're looking for a Bug no one's ever seen before.
Some kind of smart Bug.
And it probably knows we're coming.
Saddle up!
Evasive action.
Get us clear for warp, Number Two.
Clear in five, four...
Initiating star drive in five...
This is Rodger Young.
We're going down.
Get out! Abandon ship! Come on!
- Zander!
- Here!
- We've got to get to the rescue deck!
- Come on!
Captain!
Abandon ship. That is an...
She's dead, Carmen!
Here!
Follow me!
Ready?
Hit it!
Life pod Bravo- Six-Three-Two, abort.
Scouting for a landing zone.
Checking terrain. Here!
- Can you handle that?
- Piece of cake.
We've lost the Rodger Young.
Fleet Command, we have confirmation.
The Rodger Young is down.
Rodger Young just burned up.
It's on the rescue net.
Any survivors?
Well, they're getting tarred up there pretty bad.
Life pod Bravo- Six-Two-Three, abort!
Is anyone receiving?
Affirmative.
This is Roughneck Two-Zero.
You're breaking up. Say again.
- Carmen?
- Say again. I'm losing you.
Prepare for landing!
Retro in three, two, one.
Fire!
- You okay?
- Uh-huh.
Get out.
This is Roughneck Two-Zero.
Are you receiving? Over.
This is Roughneck Two-Zero.
Carmen, are you receiving?
This is Roughneck Two-Zero.
Carmen, are you receiving?
Johnny, is that you?
Yeah, it's me!
What's your position and situation?
We're in Bug City,
20 meters underground.
Position: south 42. east 118.
Situation is...
I repeat, south 42, east 118.
Situation is extremely hostile.
I need a squad to pull 'em out!
- Direction?
- Three clicks, south by southwest.
Look out!
- What do you wanna do?
- You heard the lieutenant!
Rescue party!
- Search squad, come with me!
- Cancel that!
You know as well as I do she's already dead.
Sorry, buddy.
Roughnecks, let's move.
All right.
Why didn't they kill us?
They want us alive.
We should go this way.
"A" company's that way.
Yeah.
But Carmen's down there.
Hey, I hate to be rude, buddy, but word has it she'd dead.
- She's still alive.
- How do you know?
- I don't know how I know, but I know.
- Listen.
You got command, but going off mission. That's a serious offense.
Yeah. I think they hang you for that.
Roughneck Two-Zero, proceed on mission.
I need two volunteers.
One day, someone like me... is gonna kill you... and your whole fucking race.
You know what this is?
Sure, you do.
You're some kind of big, fat, smart Bug, aren't ya?
Come on.
This is Roughneck Two-Zero.
Brain Bug sighted moving west of grid five.
Run!
- Give me the nuke!
- You trying to be a hero?
I'm trying to kill some Bugs, sir.
Get outta here!
Move!
You like that?
Come on! You want some more!
You like that? You want a little more?
Come on!
Down!
Come on, Carmen.
We did it!
- What's goin' on?
- We got it!
Come on!
What's it thinking, Colonel?
It's afraid.
Well, look who's here.
You made it. Good.
It was you, wasn't it?
You told me how to find Carmen.
Well, that's classified.
You know. Whenever the three of us are together...
I feel like things might just work out.
I hope you're right.
We've got one of their Brains now.
Pretty soon we'll know how they think, and then we'll know how to beat them.
One day, it will all be over... and everyone will forget that this was the moment.
This is when it turned.
And it wasn't the mighty Fleet.
It wasn't some fancy new weapon.
It was a drill instructor named Zim who captured a Brain.
Come on!
He got him! Yeah!
Zim got the Bug, man!
- Good job, Sergeant.
- Thank you, sir.
That would be Private, sir.
- Carry on, Private.
- Yes, sir!
What mysteries will the Brain Bug reveal?
Federal scientists are working... around the clock to probe its secrets.
Once we understand the Bug, we will defeat it.
We have the ships.
We have the weapons.
We need soldiers.
Soldiers like
Lieutenant Stack Lumbreiser...
Over the target area now, Captain.
And Captain Carmen Ibanez.
This is the captain speaking.
All personnel prepare for drop.
Soldiers like Private Ace Levy and Lieutenant John Rico.
Come on, you apes!
You wanna live forever?
We need you all.
Service guarantees citizenship.
Oh, it's all yours.
This is out of my league.
Relax, Chief.
We'll take it from here.
No! Aahh!
There he is...
The ultimate soldier.
No mercy, no pity.
No fear.
Oh yeah.
Save it.
They'll glitch, then overload and shut down.
Help me!
Happens every time.
Everything's under control, Dixon.
Out of sight, and completely out of mind, do you get my meaning?
I understand completely, sir.
Needs of national security.
That's good, Dixon.
That's very good.
You've done a great job.
Just make sure that nobody saw nothin'.
National security.
Thank you, ma'am.
He was pounding the wall like a road jig or something,
just... over and over again, like a-an automatic, and just--
Are you trying to tell us that this was a man?
- A human being?
- Oh, definitely.
A man machine!
The new reports add weight to the accusations
leveled at the Chaank
Armaments Corporation,
by a growing alliance of humanist organizations,
who insist that
Chaank is, quote:
The original allegations arose after the horrific death
of Joint Chief Executive
Bob Nicholson,
currently unexplained.
And tonight are still fueling demonstrations
outside Chaank's downtown facility.
Chaank kills children!
Chaank kills children!
Chaank kills children!
Chaank kills children!
Wait!
Wait!
Miss Cale, can we have a statement?
I understand the deep, emotional reactions to allegations of illegal projects.
But I assure you, a full public disclosure will be made by this corporation.
And all your questions will be answered.
Earlier today, a Chaank spokesman said he believed
that new Joint Chief Executive
Hayden Cale's impressive reputation
would bring an end to the public disquiet.
Miss Cale, are you aware that under the '94 FOI revision all new exoctic projects must be disclosed to congress?
Of course she is aware!
Chaank isa responsible corporation with a clear world vision.
As a Chief Executive yourself,
Mr. Ridley. does that vision include systematic law breaking?
We know our maxim:
Hard technology for a hard world.
If it wasn't for people like us, you'd all be speaking Russian.
So how did this report get out?
There's a leak somewhere, we tried to stomp on it, but...
Fuck the leak!
Now our alleged involvement made prme time last night.
You gotta can the stations.
Easier said than done with the new syndicators.
Then find the leak, and plug him.
Her.
I'm the leak.
Well, that's stunningly noble, Cale.
But we're not selling hamburgers.
Your behavior on camera and off is not proven conducive to better public relations.
That's a mutual observation, Scott.
And irrelevant.
GSE has imposed me to clean under your carpets, and rest assured,
I suck like an Electrolux.
Incidentally,
I speak Russian.
- I'm gonna sit down now.
- You're a Chief Executive.
Start acting like it.
All right.
One:
This corporation's belligerent stance in it's attempts to surpress the media are breeding rumor and protest.
So I'm sure you'll all agree that a public disclosure would be preferable to an other outburts on the networks or syndicators.
- Two...
- This is a moot discussion anyway.
The Hardman project just doesn't work.
We're recommending a complete shutdown.
- What are you talking about?
- It's fundamentally flawed.
- John.
- Direct cerebral downloading
- generates collateral errors.
- John.
I've explained this to Dante over and over.
- John.
- You know how excitable he gets.
- John!
- What! What!
Shut the fuck up.
Did I just hear right?
Am I to understand that those demonstrators outside
- might actually have a point?
- You should understand--
I want every suspect project shut down!
I want all the details on my desk tonight, and I want Dante fired right now.
With respect, Miss Cale, he's an invaluable asset.
He never submits reports, he illegally orders supplies, he's working secretly in Vault Ten, and he's not here now!
I vote we kick him out.
You should understand that you're one of us now.
Are you still itching?
Those monitors take a while to get used to.
Listen, thread carefully around Dante.
- Are you threatening me?
- No.
Read Nicholson's file.
Hi, Hayden. I just spoke with Jack Dante.
He says he'll see you now.
He'll see me?
Great.
Excuse me, which way to Engineering?
Uh...
What are you doing in here?
This is my room.
Well, keep it clean.
Get out of my room.
When I say I wanna see you,
I expect you to come to my office.
- Who are you?
- Hayden Cale.
I run this corporation.
Oh.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
The boss lady.
Yeah.
Don't I know you?
I want to see what you're doing in Vault Ten.
Entry is rated
Dual Code Access.
You've got to get Ridley to swipe his card the same time as yours.
- So how do you do it?
- I'm smart.
Show me.
What does the number
7796452 mean to you?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Dont recognize your own com link number?
How about account ident?
213-95234-C containing
7,852,320 dollars and 27 cents...
...I believe.
How did you get that information?
Same way I got your address,
1011 Century Plaza, same way I could get your door code if I wanted to:
Hacking!
I've got all the best gear right here.
I can find out anything I want.
Stay out of my files.
Oh, well, I think I'm going to find out all about you...
...Miss Cale.
I understand the deep emotional response--
I-I-I understand--
...the deep emotional re--
...deep emotional respo-response--
...to allegations of--
...illegal projects.
Where you been?
Been gettin' provisions.
See, B?
Goods.
All right.
And...
Wang!
Almost forgot.
I got this from Morse today.
Scott Ridley.
Also know as the Rat.
I want you...
...to implant that on your brain.
And of course, the lovely Cale,
Nicholson's replacement.
They are the target.
Whe should have hid right after Nicholson croaked.
But we didn't.
You gotta learn patience.
Now remember these faces.
The core containment can not be opened without their D-Lock sequences.
We just ought to play the Cutter.
- It's 90 minutes max.
- It'll never work.
- Two hours minimum.
- In any case we only use the Cutter if they refuse to spill.
- They won't.
- They will.
And so...
...the weird turned pro.
- We can't just ignore him!
- Watch me.
Fine! Then just give me your card, and I'll deal with Dante.
You can go home and shed your skin!
Fuck you!
Why don't you go back to your ten million dollar apartment and play with your fucking cat, huh?
You're as morally reprehensible as the rest of us.
He could be building anything down there.
Nicholson did what you're doing.
You read the autopsy.
- Shark attack.
- In this fucking building?
He was chewed to death.
His body was covered in synthetic lubricants, and all Dante ever said is he's building the "meanest motherfucking frontline morale destroyer ever".
In his words.
And you wanna keep him busy?
I just wanna stay alive.
I thought this was a responsible corporation.
Christ. Hardly.
Accessing personnel file
0-5-7-0: DANTE, J.
Subject was orphaned just after birth.
Primary education in various state institutions.
A serious source of disruption,
he was transferred to a secure unit at age seven
after killing a fellow student in a mantrap he built himself.
Released into the care of
Chaank Corporation
by special executive order
NSA22/134.
Three acquittals for sexual assault, homicide and weapons offences.
Judicial psychological reports
are borne out by
Chaank psyche-evaluation.
...reached the conclusion that Jack Dante is a prime example
of accute violent psychosis, allied to extreme technical virtuosity.
Try "HARDCORE".
- Bad guess.
- I want you out!
- I just got here.
- You know what I mean.
But I'm having so much fun!
You know, it's cool here.
There's loads of... stuff!
Except, you know, nobody talks to me, and,
I'm cleverer than anyone, and nobody comes even near me.
Except you.
And I know what you're after.
With weapons like mine, and authorization like yours, we could do some serious damage.
Sounds like a wet dream to me.
I got something
I wanna show you.
That's not it.
Hold on to this for a second, would you?
Ta-daaa!
I just knew I'd seen you someplace before.
I was...
- I was just a kid.
- Oh, come on, admit it!
You are hot.
- Jelly, baby.
- Get out.
God, that turns me on.
Would you like to do it, like really kind of...
...weird?
Right.
Time of the month.
You know, all that stuff is a total mystery to me.
Get some rest.
It's incredibly stupid, the perimiter access says Adam and I still work here.
So much for automated security.
Time for a big burge.
And down.
And mark.
Okay.
Recap time, yeah?
All right, when the bypass is in place, and the facility is vacated, we down the sensing network.
And move in through the northern gate, courtesy...
...of the lock decoder.
Check.
Now once we get inside, we head straight up to the 60th floor,
make our way to the initialization area, and hole up for 0600 hours.
- Bang! Cale and Ridley arrive.
- And we appropriate their swipe cards.
We also extract their
D-Lock sequences!
- But I think that--
- You have got to remember that.
And turn that
1980 shit down.
Core containment is located deep within the foundations of the building, surrounded by 22 medium security vaults.
Now the only viable access is through a deep corridor, negotiating a tech seal, a serious mother of a bulkhead, and finally, the core seal itself.
All courtesy of the swipe cards and the D-Lock sequences.
The containment is the most secure area of the building, protecting Chaank's digital soft spot, a quad matrix of googolplectic memory co-processors and 350 billion in master software bonds!
Aroo! Aroo!
Arooha!
When you must walk, then walk.
Yeah...
Now, when the job is done, we then make a quick exit out.
And hope nobody wants to start a shootout.
Yeah.
John, we gotta do something about the bitch.
She's cut her own throat, her dismissal is already being arranged, what the hell do you expect to do about it tonight?
How the fuck should I know?
You're the creative type; come up with a car accident or something.
- Oh, for chissake.
- John, we got orders of banned hardware from every blockade and embargoed army on the planet.
We are knee deep into brain wiping ex-battle vets.
That situation is being contained.
On a personal level, pertaining directly to you and I, she is gonna piss Dante right off.
The cat is gonna tear shit out of the pigeons!
- We gotta do something about her.
- Don't you do anything about it!
- I'm coming right up there. Don't--
- Fuck you.
Hi, Scott!
Hi.
Just wanted a quick word.
What do you wanna talk about?
Entropy.
You know?
Order into chaos.
Certainty into unpredictability.
Growth into decay.
Sometimes I just like to pile up my bricks so that I can just knock 'em down again, that's the good bit.
Look.
This is order.
Straight. Truly.
Now don't you think that's more interesting?
Frankly, no, it's just a broken pencil.
Oh.
Well, I wanna show you what I made.
Great.
This is a neuro-synaptic remote relay controller.
This button...
...defaults the system to "ON".
Like a dead man's hand, though, you have to hold it in to keep the thing under control.
What thing?
Patience, dude.
So what happens?
Hopefully...
...you die!
What!
The initial test was a success, but I always think it is wise to double check, don't you?
For God's sake, Jack!
Scott!
Be reasonable.
You're planning to slay my sweetie boss?
You did give her your access swiping card.
She stole it!
Oh.
Scott, I'm sorry, I...
I hadn't thought of that.
Here.
Don't you ever call my girlfriend a thief!
Scott.
I'm sorry.
What do you think?
That good, huh?
God, what a kick!
What's it like to feel stark terror?
Order into chaos.
The way of the world.
We've a helluva situation, here.
You've got a helluva situation, you understand me?
Get over here right now.
I'm in level 3PR.
Get here now!
Fuck off.
It's here.
It's Cale.
They really never left.
Change of plan.
Let's go!
So I scanned the whole goddamn building until I found him.
Well, you think it could wait until better times?
It's a little late.
This could wait till morning at least.
- Oh yeah? You think so?
- Yeah. Yeah, I think so.
Geez...
Fire the cleaners.
Yeah.
It's worse than it looks.
What, the cops caught you playing with your Hardman again?
Yeah, that's it, laugh it up,
Miss Chief Executive.
This is your problem.
It's Ridley.
Something did that to him.
Watch this, uh...
I've got the security surveillance tape.
I checked the access record.
Something came out of the vault...
...and did that to him.
Which vault?
Which vault?
Ten.
Give me your card.
What are you gonna do?
What are we gonna do!
Swipe now. Swipe now.
Swipe now.
Hey, dude.
Workin' late?
Yeah.
Watcha doin'?
Oh... budget reports.
You know, boring stuff.
I hate those.
All done.
Did you hear about what happened to Ridley?
No.
He's dead.
I showed him my thing, and it killed him.
- I'm impressed.
- I knew you would be.
Do you know what this means?
No?
It means that you can up me.
We could be the Demoliton Duo forever.
Why don't you get the personell hard disk, and I'll do that now?
Sure.
Which format is it?
I thought you said you were finished.
No.
Bitch!
Bitch!
Bitch!
God, that was stupid!
It was. Ridley's dead,
I'm in charge; you're fired.
I am very disappointed.
Drop it.
Drop the gun.
- Get your ass in there, Ho Ho.
- Who are you guys?
Where's Ridley?
It's a bad time.
- Where's Ridley?
- He's dead!
Tough bananas.
No problem.
The command chain will automatically promote the next in line.
W-well, I d-I don't have my card.
I-I gave it to her!
Lost it.
- Did ya?
- Mm.
What's this, then?
Huh?
Write down your
D-Lock sequences, please.
Sure.
Thank you.
See?
Give me the sequence.
No.
Bring the Cutter.
Did you ever see that movie Scarface?
I know a better way into the containment.
Follow me.
You're awfully keen to be on our team all of a sudden.
That bitch just fired me.
Now go watch.
Hold it!
This isn't taking us to the containment.
Now whatever it is you are doing...
...don't.
- He knows this place inside out.
- He doesn't know everything.
Check your prints. The containment is surrounded by security vaults.
So?
So, don't you think it would be a lot faster to cut through a standard vault door, and 14 feet of concrete, and a nuke proof bulkhead and
2 inches of molybdenic composite?
Nice.
You know what that means?
That means the seal in
Vault Ten has been breached.
Vault Ten contains some kind of death machine.
- And your friends are letting it out.
- Shut up!
Warmonger.
Hey!
Don't worry about him.
Just get this stuff inside.
Christ.
Almost, but not quite.
What's that?
Ah. This? Backup.
I always carry backup.
Why are you wearing those glasses?
Because this is a surprise part-ay!
Suurpriiiise!
But you should have come in fancy dress.
Weyland!
May your spirit rise, man.
It's redemption time.
All I saw, was something big, fast and fucking dangerous.
- Frontline morale destroyer.
- Shut up!
What does Weyland think?
He's dead, man.
It took him out.
I'm sorry, man, I tried to do everything I could.
There was nothing more
I could do.
- I swear to God--
- I've seen what this thing can do!
- Shut the fuck up!
- We have to take him down!
Yutani, you calm down now.
You're out of line.
- Calm down!
- Listen to me! Fuck you!
- You fuckin' idiot!
- Calm the fuck down!
You listen to me!
- Yutani, you're out of line!
- I'm out of line?
Excuse me?
Uhm... Hey.
STOP!
Dudes! Dudette.
I guess that you're all pretty concerned at this point,
but then again, hey...
Who wouldn't be?
Because, uh...
Oh! Wait, folks.
This late breaking news flash just in:
There is a psycho death bot on the loose.
There is, however, a way out.
All it takes is for Cale to agree to...
One:
Reinstate my access.
Two:
Forget everything that's happened here tonight, and three:
Agree to...
...interface with me on a regular basis.
- All you need to do is sign.
- Yeah, sign my ass.
Ooh, God! That's a sharp comeback.
Is that how you reacted when David divorced you?
- What?
- I said:
Is that how you reacted when David divorced you?
What the hell is this?
Fuckin' Oprah Winfrey?
Oprah? John, we are talking quality, here!
We are talking Gerraldo!
Cale?
Miss Cale.
I realize that this is extremely difficult for you,
but how did you feel when your family disowned you?
- In print, no less.
- That's bullshit!
Wrong answer.
The correct answer is:
It's all in the files.
Except...
...why?
Why did they do that to you?
What did you do that was so bad?
That's it, man, we're out of here.
Beta retreat.
Hey, hey! What about us?
Wa-wait, loo-look!
What about you, Ho Ho?
It's your problem, you deal with it.
It's not our problem, we had nothing to do with this!
Nothing! Right, Cale?
Tell him!
Wa-wait, loo-look! What about compassion, huh?
Or human mercy, huh?
Think about it at least, for God's sake!
So tag along, moosehead.
We ain't gonna look out for ya.
- Sure this is the right way?
- Yeah, two more offices. That way.
What are you, a one-man percussion section or something?
Move it.
Engine quiet.
All right, stand back.
Hold it.
A Category One fire alert would close blast doors.
All over the building.
- Make problems for the machine.
- Yeah, and make problems for us.
- Let's do it.
- Does anybody have a match?
- Not me.
- Not me.
Not me. But I do have a thermic detonator.
Isn't that a little archaic?
Hardwire D.C.
Can't be jammed.
Here.
What do you think you are? Stallone?
Shouldn't you put it closer to the detector?
It's a shaped charge.
Straight up.
Move.
What are you carrying around a det for, anyway?
Once we got to the core, we were gonna pile everything right up to into the middle of that vault, and then blow the shit out of it.
- And steal all the money.
- No, we were gonna blow that up, too.
Dead battery.
Another.
Why were you gonna blow up the money?
Strike a blow for humanitarian causes.
Put as many people like you out of business as we can.
People like me? I'm not the armed raid around here.
Neither are we, honey.
- Blanks?
- That's right.
Not a live round between us.
Great!
Terrific!
I'm being protected by the Three Stooges!
- Minus one.
- Hey, fuck you, Ho Ho!
You guessed it.
Humanist Alliance.
We're the good guys.
What's the problem?
- No power.
- Explosion must have ruptured those feeds.
That's it!
Time to change the game plan...
...treehuggers.
Why did you leave that lying around?
You knew Ho Ho was gonna turn out to be the fat, sweaty, desperate psycho!
- You gave him the knife.
- Oh, really mature.
Well, Big Boy has got a gun now.
A real gun.
Real bullets.
And he's not gonna let you play with it.
Come on, kids!
Everybody out.
Suck me.
Listen up, children.
We're all going down the service elevator.
And when going into a deep, dark hole, a smart boy always pushes a couple of canaries ahead of him.
Shall we?
Nothing personal,
You understand.
I hope this, uh... this won't affect our professional relationship.
What'd you do? Huh?
What did you do!
What are you up to, huh?
What'd you do?
- Nothing!
- Nothing? Nothing?
If you're not up to anything, then why aren't we going down?
No!
It's pinned me down!
Hit the button!
Press the button!
Hit the button!
Christ.
- Do we have any more explosives?
- Nada.
Flairs, dets?
Does anybody have a cigarette?
We have nothing.
How ya doin'?
Uhm...
We're gonna need a bandage or something here.
You're the man.
What are you lookng at?
Look...
We didn't expect trouble, you know?
We're just a caring, humane attack squad.
- Well, you got guts.
- You spelling that D-U-M-B?
What is this place?
I don't know.
Give me my card.
- Access denied.
- Come on, I'm Chief Executive.
Access denied.
All right, let me try the old
Ho Ho Execu-card.
Welcome.
Well... so much for job description, huh?
Imagine getting strapped into this.
- Nice shades, huh?
- Yeah.
Cryonics.
They're just kids.
What is going on here?
This is Chaank's weapon of the future.
You take an injured war vet, make sure he's listed MIA, and erase his mind.
Pump up his violent nature and program him with knowledge of every weapon and fighting skill you can think of.
He becomes the ultimate fighting unit.
No mercy. No pity.
No fear.
Man and machine indivisible.
Shame.
I was beginning to like you.
We've completed preliminary cerebral load.
This is the first test of its effectiveness.
C'mon, hit it.
Okay, okay, kay, kay, kay.
Turn it off, t-t-turn it off.
I-I think I know what I did wrong. I think...
This is gonna work!
I said turn the camera off!
I would've stopped this had I known about it.
Yeah, sure,
I believe you.
I didn't know about tihs until now!
Sure!
- What do we do now?
- Call the syndicators!
Call the networks!
911, call now.
I'm on your side.
...and, we got a little bit of a situation happening, uhm...
I'm in, uh, t-the lab here, the covert lab,
and I just found a whole bunch of bodies, and sort of freezer type things.
So let me get this straight.
You say you have proof that the Chaank Corporation is involved in illegal weapons projects?
I mean, I know that sounds far fetched...
But a homicidal maniac monster has got you trapped on the 65th floor!
It's... It's messy.
And, uh--
While you're up there, say hello to Elvis for me, okay?
- We're on our own.
- Hey! I am here.
No you're not! And besides that, you little freak,
- I'm gonna cut your eye out!
- How does he know where we are?
- He doesn't.
- Wrong. You are in the covert lab.
Turning me off won't turn you off.
I me-I mean
"won't turn me off."
Lifesign transmitter.
Emits a local beacon pulse.
It's how he knows where we are.
Yeah, do it.
Give me this one.
Okay.
Let's go.
Ah!
Not so fast, troops.
You still need the password.
One mean mother.
You wanna know what the neatest thing is?
Enhanced Pheromone Tracing.
That's what the keys are.
- What does that mean?
- It keys on fear.
The more afraid you are, the sharper its trace.
Access Amnesia Interface; still a deal in talk.
I wanna talk to Cale alone.
- Okay.
- Yessss!
It's not okay.
Yeah?
Go fax yourself.
Very funny!
How smart are you gonna be when the Warbeast chews your head off?
You wanna live?
You've got to stop being afraid!
How are you gonna manage that, wise guy?
How are you gonna fight being eaten alive?
No problem.
Suit me up.
- I should be doing this.
- Who'd set up the computer?
Look, you broke achievement records at Cal-Tech,
I delievered extra pepperoni.
- How'd you know that?
- Uhnn...
- Why didn't you volunteer?
- I did!
- He pulled rank.
- I get the duty.
Nice.
You sure this process is reversible?
It'll save your personality to disk.
I can load it back any time.
Yeah? You better make it a big disk.
- Ready?
- Ready.
The arrogant dragon will learn to repent, my friend.
Absolutely.
Careful out there.
Oh, wait a minute,
I got something to say.
I'll be back.
I'll keep it close to my heart.
Remain here!
Excecuting combat objective now!
This area is secure!
Okay, we've got two choices here.
One: We hole up here and hope he beats the crap out of it.
No way.
No more hiding.
Or two...
Let's go.
I wanna talk to you.
- What do you wanna talk about.
- Parallel processing.
Two units interfacing simultaneously, with a high degree of systemic compatibility.
There's a suspicion of corrupted data.
Probably just a binary area.
You're not that fucked up, Cale.
- How did you feel when you killed it?
- Killed what?
I never killed anything in my entire life!
Okay, how do you feel about household appliances?
- I don't feel anything.
- Cale...
You need to understand.
We need to interface.
You need me.
Like I need a chainsaw up my ass.
The thing is,
I read your file.
It took some code, but I finally got into Sonic Health's network, and then I got into you, which brings us back to your sink disposal unit.
I was giving, uh... her a bath.
I... only left her for a moment.
But she didn't drown, did she?
I got distracted, and I...
I couldn't hear the sounds.
Poor Amy.
That nasty machine at her arm all up.
Chewed it right off.
Child killer.
It was screaming so loud that I lost my temper.
I dragged her out of the sink, and she came away so easily.
I tried to hold her, but she slipped.
She's so slippery. And I'm holding on, but she's so slippery.
And so red.
And she's falling on the ground.
And I can't hold on to her.
And all the time, she'll die in my arms.
There are pieces of her little arm in the drain.
All right.
It's totally all right.
We're a system.
We're binary.
Two interactive units on the harddrive.
One motherboard.
I'll be your baby.
No.
- Give baby.
- I'll be your baby.
No!
How does that feel!
I... came to save you.
I don't need your saving.
I just need your help.
We need to destroy it all.
- How ya doin'?
- Not bad.
Listen to me!
Listen to me!
Your mission is still online!
You got that?
Take these down to the core containment.
We're gonna blow
Chaank to hell.
There's no way. There's no way I can get past that bulkhead.
That's why we gotta find Raimi and reload him.
He's got Carpenter's codes.
Come on!
God damn it!
Come on!
No!
Go, go, go!
Come on!
Come on, come on!
Come on.
No!
Hydraulically operated hoist!
Position: 20 floors above!
Secured at the roof!
Okay.
Come with me!
- Leave him!
- No!
We must consider him defunct!
- He's not defunct, he's just injured!
- I'm okay.
If one unit is safe, do not endanger it for a potential second!
We are not safe!
None of us are safe!
If one unit is safe...
...do not endager it...
...for a potential second!
Don't! Don't! Do! Or, I don't know--
All right, get this fucking machine off him!
Leave it, he'll be completely blank!
We have to load his program first in!
It... hurts... so...
Follow me!
And do not argue!
Stay close!
Next bay!
Service hatch!
Our exit to the hoist!
Cale! Reconnect the feeds beneath the drum!
- Yutani!
- Hai!
Re-engage clutch plate now!
Got it!
Raimi, just get out of there.
Raimi!
Are you deaf?
Raimi, get out of there!
Quiet!
Hai!
Shoryuken!
I'm out!
Now we move!
Go to the hoist!
Come on!
Come on!
- Go to the hoist!
- Not without you!
Go to the--
Shoot it!
Help me!
Help me!
Come here!
Come on!
Go!
Come on!
Directive!
Battle directive!
Battle directive... ended...
What the fuck is going on?
- Have you got Carpenter's card?
- Yeah.
I got the D-Lock sequence, too.
- Call me.
- Wait a minute.
- This is my mission, I started it.
- Well, then let's finish it.
Drop your weapon!
- On the floor!
- Relax, man, I'm the one who called you!
- Bullshit!
- You better call reinforcements!
You better shut the fuck up!
Too bad!
- This is unit 257...
- You stupid motherfucker!
You've got the right to remain silent!
Holy donuts!
Jesus Christ!
It jumped from the roof!
This way!
Come on!
Open it!
Come on!
Go!
Cale!
Come on!
Come on!
Tight grip!
Sequence!
- Swipe now.
- Ready?
- Yeah!
- One, two, three - swipe!
Welcome.
How long does this take?
- One, two, three - swipe!
- Welcome.
You should have run away when you had the chance.
Why didn't you just go away!
The needs of the many outweight the needs of the few.
That's a stupid reason!
You're making me kill you for a stupid reason!
God...
I thought...
...we could have a nice time.
And look after each other, and... do nice things.
God!
My hand hurts.
Come here, Jack.
Come here.
Download it, Jack.
You can interface with the motherboard.
What did... what did you do that for?
Show this to the cops.
What's going on?
- I'm leaivng you, Jack.
- Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha...
Here...
Play with this.
Goodbye, Jack.
Don't leave me in here,
Cale, I don't like it.
Cale, if you leave me in here,
I will kill you!
I mean it, you fucking bitch!
And I'll blow you to bits!
Oh no.
It's a hell of a fire trap in there, man.
You better listen to me!
Because I'm dangerous!
Then you're in the right business, Jack.
I'm not in this business anymore.
Don't leave me in here.
Mama?
I don't like the dark.
For all the children.
[Sizzling]
MED-TECH: Bring the bastard down before he chokes to death.
MED-TECH: Well, happy day.
It's Castor Troy.
SEAN: Hey, hold it.
Can I have a light?
WALTON: You know, those things can kill you.
[Laughs]
Get his boots.
[Snapping]
Dubov?
I didn't touch your wife.
And I didn't touch your sister.
But I know your wife loves you.
She's waiting for you.
So let's get out of here.
[Grunts]
WALTON: You're more brain-dead than Dubov.
SEAN: Ow!
Unh.
Out!
Out.
GUARD: There they are!
SECOND GUARD: Look out.
GUARD: Under fire.
We have men down in C-4.
[Screaming]
Move!
[Screaming]
[Alarms sounding]
DUBOV: Get down!
[Shouting]
SEAN: Dubov!
No!
Get out!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Dubov!
Give me your hand.
Come on.
You can do it.
-Aah!
-No!
No! No!
No!
EVE: Sean?
Wait.
What are you doing?
CASTOR: Ah! I'm sorry.
Have a nice day.
Have a nice day?
What is with you?
Is his your way of not dealing with this morning?
Yeah. Yeah, maybe.
Sean?
Sean!
I know it's hard for you, but it's hard for me, too... and we still have to go.
Happy birthday, Mikey.
He took our baby, Sean.
He took our little boy.
[Crying]
WANDA:
You turned your beeper off.
CASTOR:
Yes, well, my son's birthday.
WANDA: Well, here's some poetic justice, sir.
Castor Troy's dead.
AGENT: He got killed trying to escape from Erewhon.
CASTOR: Where's his body?
I want to see his body.
WANDA:
It hasn't been recovered yet.
It hasn't been recovered yet?!
Get the LAPD on this.
WANDA: Even if he's alive...
Castor isn't stupid enough to come back to the city.
[Sighs]
You must--you must trust me.
He's already here.
[Car alarm chirps]
[Dialing]
WOMAN: County General.
How may I direct your call?
SEAN: Dr. Archer, please.
It's an emergency.
-And who's calling?
-Her husband.
NURSE:
Dr. Archer, call on line three.
SEAN: I know this sounds crazy, but--Shit!
[Sighs]
Sean?
Eve. Listen carefully.
The man you think is your husband, isn't.
Who is this?
Please, just listen.
Take Jamie.
Go to your mother's.
Don't tell him where you're going.
Whoever you are, don't call again.
MAN ON PHONE: Operations.
I need Victor Lazarro immediately.
-Regarding?
-lnformation about Castor Troy.
MAN: I'll transfer you, sir.
CASTOR: Sean Archer here.
Who's calling?
Well, if you're Sean Archer...
I guess I'm Castor Troy.
Ah, yes.
WOMAN ON RADIO: This escapee is considered extremely dangerous.
If you have any information concerning the whereabouts... of Castor Troy...
[Clicks off]
[Siren]
DIETRICH INTO PHONE:
You're goddamn right. Yeah.
This shit's so good, it's gonna make your dick hard.
What?
Cheryl? Cheryl's a liar.
SEAN: Dietrich.
So you're still selling hops and drugs... to Cheryl and Phil Roy.
Ha ha ha!
Castor fucking Troy!
Ah, man. You scared me, man.
All right. Ha ha.
I never should have sold you those bombs.
Just can't say no to a friend.
SEAN: Can't say no to money.
You drug dealer.
-What's the matter?
-What?
Look like you fucked your mother. Let's relax.
DIETRICH: Hey!
MAN: Hey, Castor.
FITCH: I don't believe this.
Castor Troy!
ALDO: What are you doing?
Woo-oooh!
WOMAN: Hey, baby, remember me?
I'm your favorite peach.
SECOND WOMAN: I thought
I was your favorite.
FITCH: Look at this guy.
You look pretty good for a dead guy. Hey!
DIETRICH: Let's go.
Here.
So what do you want to do?
You wanna leave the country?
SEAN: I'm not going anywhere.
I'm gonna get Sean Archer... with your help.
OK.
Welcome home, baby.
Oh!
ALDO: How we supposed to do that?
He's vulnerable at home.
FITCH: No. This is
Sean Archer we're talking about.
This isn't just some Boy Scout.
ALDO: Fitch.
Besides, his house is probably alarmed up the wazoo.
SEAN: Code is 10-19-86.
That's his dead son's birthday.
Don't it just break your heart?
Ha. That's brilliant.
But sick.
[Laughter]
ALDO: How is it that you know so much about Sean Archer?
I, uh...sleep with his wife.
[Laughter]
Christ, this is great.
FITCH: So, once we kidnap Supercop, then what?
Tiny... surgery.
I'd like to take his-- his face... off.
Yes.
Now, if you'll all excuse me...
I have to use the...
Iittle boy's wee-wee room.
DIETRICH: Cas?
You want to take his...face--
Yes.
His face...off!
The eyes... nose... skin.
It's coming off!
The face... off.
DIETRICH:
No more drugs for that man.
[Laughing]
I'm not me.
I'm me.
Not me.
Me.
Castor Archer.
Castor Archer.
SASHA: I thought you were dead.
SEAN: I'm not dead. I'm me.
No, look. What I'm trying to tell you, Pollux...
No, look. What I'm trying to tell you, Pollux... is once we get the full protection of the government... to help us get rid of our rivals, we'll be set.
Then maybe, just maybe
I'll get my frickin' face back.
Then I'll just have one jag-off to take care of.
[Loud rock music playing]
[Music stops]
KARL: Hey, where you going?
Where you going?
JAMIE: Karl, stop it.
Maybe two. Hold on.
-Karl, stop it!
-Calm down!
JAMIE: My dad's gonna--Karl!
CASTOR: Happy hunting.
Catch you later.
Like Mr. Fuckin' lnvisible gives a shit about you anyways.
So fucking hold still!
Now say you're sorry.
-I'm sorry.
-I didn't hear.
-I'm sorry!
-Mean it.
I'm so sorry!
CASTOR:
Dress up like Halloween... and ghouls will try to get in your pants.
Typical, Dad.
Some guy tries to rape me, and I'm to blame?
CASTOR: This isn't you.
You haven't been the same since Mike died.
Hiding behind someone else's face... hoping you wouldn't feel the pain.
While we're talking... do you have protection?
What, you mean like condoms?
Protection.
Next time, let Karl take his pants down.
Slip this in his thigh... twist it so the wound won't close.
Now go on. Get out of here.
I am the king.
SEAN: Hmm.
Mmm.
Eve.
[Gasps]
SASHA: Aah!
Jesus! Cas, it's me!
SASHA: It's me.
SASHA: Cas...
Shh.
Come on.
It's me.
SASHA: Jesus!
Come on.
Don't you wanna talk?
SASHA: Only talk
I ever heard from you... is "Suck my tongue,"
"Love your ass," and "See ya."
Take this filthy shit off, put this on and get out of here.
No. I'm not going anywhere.
SASHA: Oh, really?
What do you expect me, after all this time... just to--just to jump on you?
Is that what you expect?
SEAN: That's not what I meant.
SASHA: What did you mean?
Is this what you meant? That?
How about this?
Is that good, huh?
[Telephone rings]
CASTER: Sean Archer.
POLLUX: Bro,
I figured he might drop in... on some of our old friends.
And if my eyes don't deceive...
I think this fellow's beginning to enjoy being you.
Good.
SEAN: Look, look,
OK, look, Sasha.
What I meant is that
I'm not going anywhere... until your brother helps me.
[Sighs]
Cas... if the FBI finds out that you were here...
I'll lose my son.
Please, Cas, you just gotta go.
I've said and done some things that made your life harder.
I know.
SASHA: How would you?
You left and never looked back.
I just know.
Look, Sasha, I'm not the same person you remember.
And for what it's worth,
I'm sorry.
-Nice looking clothes.
-Of course. They're yours.
I know. I just like 'em.
That's a nice looking kid, too.
Yeah, of course.
He's yours, too.
[Guns cocking]
How old is he?
SASHA: Five.
Nobody knows he's yours.
I was scared someone would try to hurt him just to hurt you.
Adam! Adam!
Don't play with those things.
They are very, very dangerous, OK?
Now, come on, sweetie.
I want you to meet your father.
Look at him. It's OK. Say hi.
ADAM: Hi.
SEAN: Hi.
Michael.
Michael, Michael.
SASHA: Cas.
Cas.
Cas, you're scaring him.
Let him go.
What is the matter with you?
SEAN: Get down!
[Screaming]
MAN: OK, red team, red team, break off!
SEAN: How'd you get so brave?
[Machine-gun fire]
MEGAPHONE: Come out now with your hands up!
SEAN: Put these on.
SASHA: That's a good idea.
Listen to your music.
Come on.
MUSIC: Somewhere...
MEGAPHONE: We have a warrant for your arrest!
DIETRICH: Cops.
DIETRICH: I hate cops.
SEAN: Come on, kid.
MAN: Move! Move!
Go! Go!
MUSIC:
Someday I'll wish upon a star.
SEAN: Let's get out of here!
Come on.
SEAN: Don't shoot!
My place is getting fucked up!
WOMAN: Aah!
SEAN: Take him.
DIETRICH: Cas! Cas!
Give me the boy!
SASHA: Really?! Come on!
Shit!
SASHA: Come on! Let's go!
SASHA: Be careful with him!
DIETRICH: Don't be scared, OK?
MUSIC: Somewhere... over the rainbow... skies are blue.
MUSIC: And the dreams that you dare to dream... really do come true.
Someday I'll wish upon a star... and wake up where the clouds are far... behind me.
MUSIC:
Birds fly over the rainbow.
Why then, oh, why can't l?
SASHA: Adam!
Adam!
DIETRICH: Get them out back.
Go, go, go!
MAN: Put the boy down.
SASHA: Honey, sweetie, don't touch that.
It isn't nice!
I never want to see you do that.
DIETRICH: Aha!
They're like cockroaches!
SEAN: Hey! Drop it.
That's it.
Buzz.
DIETRICH: Hey!
I told him not to fuck with me.
[Cocks gun]
[Cocks gun]
DIETRICH: Take the boy and go.
SASHA: Are you all right?
DIETRICH: Go!
SASHA: Hurry up.
DIETRICH: Hey, man... we had some good times, didn't we?
Ohhh!
[Castor Sighs]
CASTOR: I don't know what I hate wearing worse... your face or your body.
I enjoy boning your wife, but let's face it.
We both like it better the other way, yes?
So why don't we just trade back?
SEAN: You can't give back what you've taken from me.
Oh, well.
Plan "B."
Let's just kill each other.
Aah!
Aah!
Sir, why are you so upset?
It's just Pollux Troy.
KIMBERLY: Sir, look, you're on the cover of Time.
Listen. "ln a single week,
Agent Archer has ordered...
"a stunning series of blitzkrieg-style raids...
"on the hideouts, staging grounds, and safe houses...
"of our nation's assassins--"
VlCTOR: Look, we're friends, so I'll tell you face-to-face.
I don't give a damn if you are
Time's Man of the Year.
After last night's bloodbath...
I'm terminating your war on terrorists.
CASTOR: Is that because
I'm getting all the kudos... and you're not?
VlCTOR: I don't know where you get your intelligence.
Not from field agents.
Sometimes I think you know too much.
Washington's starting to worry.
Justice wants a hearing.
They're concerned about the constitutionality... of your Gestapo tactics, and frankly so am l!
[Sighs]
CASTOR: Uh...
OK, Victor, I'll give the taxpayers a break... but, uh...
I have something
I want to confess... and I don't think you're gonna like it.
I am Castor Troy.
Ahh--
[Sighs]
CASTOR: Kimmy. Kim?
KIMBERLY: Yes, sir.
Call the paramedics.
Lazarro had a heart attack.
KIMBERLY: Oh, God. Right away.
CASTOR: Thank you.
[Shower running]
Home.
[Shower stops]
Eve.
Eve.
No, honey, please don't scream.
Don't scream.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Please. Don't, don't. Shh.
Just don't look at my face.
And the voice, don't listen.
EVE: I know who you are!
You killed my son!
SEAN: I did not kill our son.
Shh.
I'm Sean.
The last time I saw you was in this room.
We had a fight when I said
I had to go away again... and I spent the night in Mike's old bed.
I'm tired, Eve.
The assignment was... to enter a federal prison as Castor Troy.
It's just fucking insane!
And a Special Ops surgeon gave me Castor's face!
And then somehow,
Castor came out of his... his coma and killed everybody who knew about the mission.
But not before transforming into me.
[Glass breaks]
I know you don't believe a word
I'm saying.
Well, here's proof, Doctor.
Your husband--me--mine--
Sean's blood type is O-negative.
Castor's is AB.
And I love you.
[Door closes]
CASTOR: Get some backup.
What a day.
You look tense.
CASTOR: I know I've been acting different lately, strange.
But I've got a confession to make, Eve.
You're not gonna like it.
Oh, Eve, I feel...
I feel so close to you.
I read your diary.
I know I shouldn't have.
I'm ashamed.
But I did.
I just want to be the man that you deserve-- passionate, attentive.
Victor Lazarro died today.
He had a heart seizure.
My mentor--gone.
First Tito, then Victor.
So what?
I hope this doesn't mean
I'm losing you.
EVE: Of course not.
You're the only family I've got.
Oh, God.
Oh, Sean.
Oh, God.
SEAN: I was hoping you'd come here.
Thank you for trusting me.
EVE: Right now...
I don't trust anyone.
SEAN:
Eve, where'd you get that gun?
EVE: I took it from my fake husband.
SEAN: Put it down.
You know I'm Sean.
EVE: Do l?
Maybe Sean's already dead.
SEAN: I'm moving very slowly.
I was thinking the other day...
I remember...
I once took a date out for surf and turf... not knowing she was a vegetarian.
So she ate bread... and, uh, broke her tooth on a rye seed.
And we drove around all night...
Iooking for an all-night dentist... and he was so drunk, he fixed the wrong tooth.
[Laughs]
And when I finally brought her home... even though it must've hurt like hell... you kissed me.
Oh...
Sean...
EVE: That man, he...
We've been living together as man and wife for a week.
Yeah, I know.
Eve...
Eve...
I put you in that position... and I can never make it up to you.
You're damn well gonna try.
Let me look at that wound before you bleed to death.
SEAN: With Lazarro gone...
Castor's the new acting director of the bureau.
He's untouchable.
EVE: Not tomorrow.
Tomorrow he'll be at Victor's service.
SEAN: Tomorrow.
That will be the day.
I want you and Jamie away from there.
Give him a good excuse.
I can cover for Jamie, but if I'm not coming... he'll know something's up.
Besides, I'm the only one who can try and explain the truth.
WOMAN: Excuse me, Mr. Archer.
Sean, what are you doing here?
CASTOR: I'm so... sorry, darling.
I just get so jealous, I mean, what is a guy to think... when his wife runs off in the middle of the night?
EVE: That I'm a doctor that's on call.
So please let me get back to work, OK?
CASTOR: Sorry.
CASTOR: Lies, distrust, mixed messages.
This is turning into a real marriage.
SEAN: How's Adam?
SASHA: I took him over to my cousin's... until this thing blows over.
CASTOR: Where's Jamie?
EVE: That's what I'm wondering.
She stole $50 from my purse and took off.
SASHA: So what's the next move?
SEAN: This isn't your fight.
EVE: Come on, you're surprised?
Our daughter won't even visit Michael's grave.
Think she gives a damn about your boss?
SASHA: He killed my brother.
I won't let him take you, too.
Whatever happens...
I promise...
Sean Archer is off your back for good.
PRIEST: My dear friends... we are here to celebrate the life of Victor Lazarro.
[Speaking Latin]
Amen.
[Speaking Latin]
PRIEST: Amen.
[Choir singing in Latin]
ALTAR BOY: Somebody back there asked me to give this to you.
PRIEST: In peace now, let us take our brother Victor... to his place of rest.
CASTOR: Ohm..
[Chanting in fake Latin]
CASTOR: lsn't this religious?
Ah...
Ah, yes.
The eternal battle between good and evil... saint and sinner.
But you're still not having any fun!
Ooh.
Honey.
Honey.
Come here.
Ahh...
And guess what.
Your daughter's on the way.
History repeats itself.
This is between us.
Leave them out of it.
CASTOR: No. You should have left them out of it.
Your son was an accident.
I wanted to kill you.
CASTOR: But you took it so personally.
Why didn't you just kill yourself or let it go?
No father could.
No brother could either.
SASHA: Neither could a sister.
Hey, baby.
Sasha, what the fuck are you doing here?
Archer, I guess I'm crashing.
You OK, baby?
Yeah. Thanks.
Sasha, baby, I'm Castor.
That's Archer.
SASHA: And I'm bored.
[Sighs]
Put the fucking gun down.
MAN: Put your guns down.
Whee!
What a predicament.
[Laughs]
Take care of our boy.
I love him so much.
Don't let him grow up to be like us. Promise?
Yeah.
SASHA: See ya.
Mom?
Aah!
Aah!
JAMIE: Mom!
SEAN: Jamie!
JAMIE: Aah!
Jamie, don't!
Aah!
Hello, Wanda?
Wanda, this is Eve Archer.
I have something crazy to tell you.
CASTOR: It's a capital crime to attempt to kill... the next boss of the FBI, yes?
SEAN: Yes.
CASTOR: Ah, yes.
SEAN: And the penalty?
CASTOR: What?
SEAN: The penalty is death!
SEAN: Die. Please, God, die.
JAMIE: Hold it!
CASTOR: Aah!
Good girl, Jamie. Shoot him.
SEAN: Don't listen to him.
He's not your father.
Hear my voice.
I'm your father.
CASTOR: Use your eyes.
Shoot him!
SEAN: Don't listen to him.
CASTOR: This scumbag shot your brother. Kill him!
Aah!
Clod.
CASTOR: No daughter of mine would shoot so wide.
CASTOR: Dad, put the gun down.
Put it down.
Dad...put it down.
Now we're gonna find out what's in papa's bag...
Peaches.
Say good-bye to papa.
Aaahhh!
Jamie!
[Siren]
EVE: Jamie!
EVE: Are you all right? God!
Sir, are you OK?
[Siren]
JAMIE: Will someone please tell me what planet I'm on?
SEAN: Get down! Move!
[Ship's horn honks]
Stop! This is the police!
Stop immediately or we will be forced to open fire.
Fire! Fire!
SEAN: Oh, shit.
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
CASTOR: You're right, Sean.
I've misbehaved.
I need to be punished.
But remember, every time you look in the mirror... you'll see my face.
Aah!
Die!
CASTOR: [Singing] Ready...
Ready for the big ride...
Baby.
[Sirens]
BUZZ: You OK, Archer?
What did you call me?
He called you Archer, sir.
EVE: Sean.
They're bringing in their top surgical team from D.C.
You're going to be OK.
[Siren]
DOCTOR: When you wake up, everything will be restored... just the way it was.
My scar.
The one near my heart?
This old bullet wound...
I won't need it anymore.
DOCTOR: OK.
Dad?
Dad?
I'm sorry I shot you.
I've got something to ask both of you.
This is Adam.
And he needs a place to live.
JAMIE: Hi.
My name's Jamie.
I'm Adam.
SEAN: Why don't you show Adam his new room?
JAMIE: Come on.
EVE: OK.
INXS: [Singing]
You shot your mouth off...
Iike a kid who's scared to have a heart.
Losing grip of what really matters...
'cause you don't know where to start.
You wake up in the morning... with a starfuck for a friend.
The things you do are so in tune... with what you're gonna hate.
What's giving you the will to live?
Is it looking for revenge?
The only life that you've got left... is hiding from the pain.
What must have happened to your soul... is skinning you alive.
The thing you fear the most is love... and that's buried deep inside.
Yeah.
So deep inside.
Don't lose your head.
'Cause I can't do the time.
Don't lose your head.
Or can you pay the price?
The heart you're building out of rock... is turning into sand.
'Cause you never took the time to think... what it means to be a man.
You act like you got the answer... when the question's never asked.
I've been to where you're coming from... but the postcards weren't so bad.
The knife I carry's been sharpened... on the mouths that won't keep shut.
I'll stab at you in the darkness...
'cause I'm trying to shed some light.
Your point of view's so meaningless... if you ever had one at all.
All you seem to care about is who's gonna take the fall.
Who's gonna take the fall for you?
Don't lose your head.
I can't do the time for you.
Don't lose your head.
Can you pay the price?
Yeah.
Mama.
Don't lose your head.
'Cause I can't do the time.
Don't lose your head.
Can you pay the price?
Don't lose your head.
'Cause I can't do the time.
Don't lose your head.
Can you pay the price?
Don't lose your head.
You can't do the time.
No, don't lose your head.
You cannot pay the price.
If you can't pay the price.
Don't lose your head.
You know I can't do the time.
You ain't worth it to me.
You ain't worth it to me.
Stardate 9521.6.
Captain's Log, U.S.S. Excelsior.
Hikaru Sulu commanding.
After three years,
I've concluded my first assignment as master of this vessel, cataloguing gaseous planetary anomalies in Beta Quadrant.
We're heading home under full impulse power.
I am pleased to report that ship and crew have functioned well.
According to this, we've completed our survey of the entire sector.
I have an energy wave at 240 degrees mark 6 port, sir.
Visual.
My God.
Shields. Shields!
She's not answering her helm.
Starboard thruster.
Turn her into the wave.
Aye.
Quarter impulse power.
Damage report.
Checking all systems, Captain.
Don't tell me that was any meteor shower.
Negative, sir.
The subspace shockwave originated at bearing 3-2-3 mark 75.
Location...
It's Praxis, sir. It's a Klingon moon.
Praxis is their key energy production facility.
Send to Klingon High Command.
"This is Excelsior, a Federation starship.
"We have monitored a large explosion in your sector.
"Do you require assistance?"
- Aye, sir.
- Mr. Valtane, any more data?
Yes, sir. I've confirmed the location of Praxis, but...
What is it?
I cannot confirm the existence of Praxis.
Onscreen.
Magnify.
Computer enhancement.
- Praxis?
- What's left of it, sir.
Captain,
I'm getting a message from Praxis.
Let's have it.
This is Brigadier Kerla speaking for the High Command.
There has been an incident on Praxis.
However, everything is under control.
We have no need for assistance.
Obey treaty stipulations and remain outside the neutral zone.
This transmission ends now.
"An incident"?
- Do we report this, sir?
- Are you kidding?
What are we doing here?
Maybe they're throwing us a retirement party.
- That suits me. I just bought a boat.
- This had better be good.
I'm supposed to be chairing a seminar at the Academy.
Captain, isn't this just for top brass?
If we're all here, where's Sulu?
Captain Sulu. On assignment.
Where's Spock?
This briefing is classified.
Ladies and gentlemen, the CinC.
As you were.
To break this information down succinctly, the Klingon Empire has roughly 50 years of life left to it.
For full details,
I'm turning this briefing over to the Federation's special envoy.
Good morning.
Two months ago, a Federation starship monitored an explosion on the Klingon moon Praxis.
We believe it was caused by over-mining and insufficient safety precautions.
The moon's decimation means the deadly pollution of their ozone.
They will have depleted their supply of oxygen in approximately 50 Earth years.
Due to their enormous military budget, the Klingon economy does not have the resources with which to combat this catastrophe.
Last month, at the behest of the Vulcan ambassador,
I opened a dialogue with Gorkon,
Chancellor of the Klingon High Council.
He proposes to commence negotiations at once.
Negotiations for what?
The dismantling of our space stations and starbases along the neutral zone, an end to almost 70 years of unremitting hostility, which the Klingons can no longer afford.
Bill, are we talking about mothballing the Starfleet?
Well, I'm sure that our exploration and scientific programs
- would be unaffected, Captain, but...
- I must protest.
To offer Klingons safe haven within Federation space is suicide.
Klingons would become the alien trash of the galaxy, and if we dismantle the fleet, we'd be defenseless before an aggressive species with a foothold on our territory.
The opportunity here is to bring them to their knees.
Then we'll be in a far better position to dictate terms.
Sir?
Captain Kirk.
The Klingons have never been trustworthy.
I'm forced to agree with Admiral Cartwright.
This is a terrifying idea.
It is imperative that we act now to support the Gorkon initiative lest more conservative elements persuade his empire that it is better to attempt a military solution and die fighting.
You, Captain Kirk, are to be our first olive branch.
We have volunteered to rendezvous with the Klingon vessel which is bringing Chancellor Gorkon to Earth and to escort him safely through Federation space.
Me?
Well, there are Klingons who feel the same way about the peace treaty as yourself and Admiral Cartwright, but they'll think twice about attacking the Enterprise under your command.
I have personally vouched for you in this matter, Captain.
You have personally vouched?
You will extend Chancellor Gorkon full diplomatic courtesy, Captain Kirk.
But a full ambassador would be better equipped...
If there's no further business,
I wish you and your crew Godspeed.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
I remind you, this meeting is classified.
I don't know whether to congratulate you or not, Jim.
I wouldn't.
We volunteered?
There is an old Vulcan proverb,
"Only Nixon could go to China."
How could you vouch for me?
That's arrogant presumption.
My father requested that I open negotiations...
I know your father's the Vulcan ambassador, for heaven's sake, but you know how I feel about this.
They're animals.
Jim, there is an historic opportunity here.
Don't believe them. Don't trust them.
- They are dying.
- Let them die.
Has it occurred to you that this crew is due to stand down in three months?
We've done our bit for king and country.
You should have trusted me.
Control, this is SD-103, approach to spacedock. Over.
SD-103, you are clear to deliver Captain Kirk and party to NCC-1701 Alpha. Over.
Captain on the Bridge.
- As you were, Lieutenant...
- Valeris, sir.
We were told that you needed a helmsman, so I volunteered.
Lieutenant, it is agreeable to see you again.
Lieutenant was the first Vulcan to be graduated
- at the top of her class at the academy.
- You must be very proud.
I don't believe so, sir.
She's a Vulcan, all right.
Let's get this over with.
Departure stations.
- Scotty.
- Aye, sir?
Did you find the engine room?
Right where I left it, sir.
Standby. Uhura, get me the dockmaster.
Control tower reading, sir.
Control, this is Enterprise requesting permission to depart.
This is Control, Enterprise.
Permission to depart granted.
Thirty seconds for port gates.
Clear all moorings.
Awaiting port gates from this mark.
All moorings clear.
Aft thrusters.
Thank you, Lieutenant.
One-quarter impulse power.
Captain, may I remind you that regulations specify thrusters only while in spacedock?
Jim?
You heard the order, Lieutenant.
Aye, sir.
Captain's Log, Stardate 9522.6.
I've never trusted Klingons, and I never will.
I could never forgive them for the death of my boy.
It seems to me our mission to escort the Chancellor of the Klingon High Council to a peace summit is problematic at best.
Spock says this could be an historic occasion, and I'd like to believe him, but how on earth can history get past people like me?
Sorry.
You could have knocked.
We are almost at the rendezvous, sir.
I thought that you would like to know.
Right.
Permission to speak freely, sir.
It is an honor to serve with you.
You piloted well out of spacedock, Lieutenant.
I've always wanted to try that, sir.
You've done well, Valeris.
As your sponsor at the academy,
I have followed your career with satisfaction, and as a Vulcan, you've exceeded my expectations.
I do not understand this representation.
It is a depiction from ancient Earth mythology, the expulsion from Paradise.
Why keep it in your quarters?
It is a reminder to me that all things end.
It is of endings that I wish to speak.
Sir, I address you as a kindred intellect.
Do you not recognize that a turning point has been reached in the affairs of the Federation?
History is replete with turning points, Lieutenant.
- You must have faith.
- Faith?
That the universe will unfold as it should.
- But is that logical? Surely we must...
- Logic, logic and logic.
Logic is the beginning of wisdom, Valeris, not the end.
This will be my final voyage onboard this vessel as a member of her crew.
Nature abhors a vacuum.
I intend you to replace me.
I could only succeed you, sir.
Now hear this. All officers to the Bridge.
Klingon battle cruiser off the port bow.
All officers to the Bridge.
Captain on the Bridge.
Shall we raise our shields, Captain?
Never been this close.
The Chancellor is undoubtedly awaiting our signal.
- Uhura, hailing frequencies.
- Aye, sir.
Right standard rudder.
Bring us alongside.
Right standard rudder.
Z plus 5 degrees.
Channel is open, Captain.
This is the Starship Enterprise,
Captain James T. Kirk commanding.
This is Kronos One.
I am Chancellor Gorkon.
Chancellor, we've been ordered to escort you through Federation space to your meeting on Earth.
Thank you, Captain.
Would you and your party care to dine this evening aboard the Enterprise with my officers, as guests of the United Federation of Planets?
We would be delighted to accept your gracious invitation.
We'll make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 1930 hours.
I shall look forward to that.
- Well, I hope you're happy.
- Captain, there is a supply of Romulan ale aboard.
It might make the evening pass more smoothly.
Officer thinking, Lieutenant.
Guess who's coming to dinner.
Energize.
- Chancellor Gorkon.
- Captain Kirk.
May I present Captain Spock, whom I believe you know.
Captain, face to face at last.
- You have my thanks.
- Chancellor.
Gentlemen, this is my daughter Azetbur, my military adviser, Brigadier Kerla, and this is General Chang, my chief of staff.
I have so wanted to meet you, Captain.
I'm not sure how to take that.
Sincere admiration, Kirk.
From one warrior to another.
Right.
This way.
I think you might enjoy a brief tour.
- They all look alike.
- What about that smell?
You know only top-of-the-line models can even talk...
You men have work?
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.
Then snap to it.
I offer a toast.
"The undiscover'd country," the future.
- "The undiscover'd country."
- "The undiscover'd country."
Hamlet, Act III, Scene 1.
You've not experienced Shakespeare until you have read him in the original Klingon.
Captain Kirk,
I thought Romulan ale was illegal.
One of the advantages of being 1,000 light-years from Federation Headquarters.
To you, Chancellor Gorkon, one of the architects of our future.
- Chancellor.
- Chancellor.
Perhaps we are looking at something of that future here.
Tell me, Captain Kirk, would you be willing to give up Starfleet?
I believe the Captain feels that Starfleet's mission has always been one of peace.
Far be it for me to dispute my first officer, but Starfleet has always been at the fore...
Captain, there's no need to mince words.
In space, all warriors are cold warriors.
General, are you fond of
Shakespeare?
We do believe all planets have a sovereign claim to inalienable human rights.
Inalien?
If you could only hear yourselves.
"Human rights."
Why, the very name is racist.
The Federation is no more than a "Homo Sapiens Only" club.
Present company excepted, of course.
In any case, we know where this is leading.
- The annihilation of our culture.
- That's not true.
- No?
- No.
"To be, or not to be."
That is the question which preoccupies our people, Captain Kirk.
- We need breathing room.
- Earth, Hitler, 1938.
I beg your pardon?
Well...
I see we have a long way to go.
We must do this again sometime.
You don't trust me, do you?
I don't blame you.
If there is to be a brave new world, our generation is going to have the hardest time living in it.
Captain Spock.
Chancellor.
- Madam.
- Captain.
Well, most kind.
"Parting is such sweet sorrow," Captain.
Have we not
"heard the chimes at midnight"?
Thank God.
Did you see the way they ate?
Terrible table manners.
I doubt that our own behavior will distinguish us in the annals of diplomacy.
I'm going to sleep this off.
Please let me know if there's some other way we can screw up tonight.
I'm going to go find a pot of black coffee.
The Enterprise hosted
Chancellor Gorkon and company to dinner last night.
Our manners weren't exactly
Emily Post.
Note to the galley,
Romulan ale no longer to be served at diplomatic functions.
Captain Kirk, will you please join me on the Bridge?
Captain Kirk?
- Captain.
- What is it?
I find this curious.
Spock, I'm really tired.
We are reading an enormous amount of neutron radiation.
Where?
Strangely enough, it appears to be emanating from us.
The Enterprise?
Valeris, do you know anything about a radiation surge?
Sir?
Chekov?
Only the size of my head.
I know what you mean.
- What's happened?
- We have fired on the Chancellor's ship.
Torpedo Room, please confirm.
Have we fired?
- Uhura, monitor.
- Aye, sir.
Direct hit.
Confirmed, sir.
We've lost gravity!
We are betrayed!
This is the Bridge. Do you read?
Do you read?
Torpedo bay, did we fire those torpedoes?
Negative, Captain.
According to inventory, we're still fully loaded.
Find Chang.
Unable to confirm or deny firing of two photon torpedoes.
- Hailing frequencies.
- Aye, sir.
Kronos One, this is Enterprise.
Do you read? Over.
Repeat. Kronos One...
It's very hard to make out, Captain.
There's been some weapons firing and a lot of shouting.
She is still listing.
She's spinning out of control.
Restoring auxiliary gravity.
Have you not a shred of decency in you, Kirk?
We come in peace, and you blatantly defile that peace.
For that,
I shall blow you out of the stars.
- We haven't fired.
- Captain.
According to our databanks, we have, twice.
Captain, they're coming about.
- They're preparing to fire.
- Shields up, Captain?
- Captain, our shields.
- Shields up, Captain?
- Signal our surrender.
- Captain?
We surrender!
- This is Enterprise. We surrender.
- If they fire at us
- with our shields down...
- I repeat.
- We surrender.
- ...we will not be able to respond.
Repeat. Enterprise surrenders.
- Are we firing torpedoes?
- I wish I knew.
Well, it sure looks like it.
I'm going aboard.
Spock, you have the conn.
I am responsible for involving you in this. I will go.
No, I'll go. You'll be responsible for getting me out of this.
We'll not be the instigators of full-scale war on the eve of universal peace.
I'm going, too. They may need a doctor.
- Perhaps you're right.
- Uhura, tell them we're coming, and tell them we're unarmed.
Aye, sir.
Have you lost your mind?
I give you my word,
I don't understand what has happened.
We're here to help.
Follow me.
- Chancellor Gorkon.
- My God.
- What has happened here?
- You dare to feign ignorance?
- What happened?
- With a direct torpedo hit, you crippled our entire gravitational field, and two of your Starfleet crew beamed aboard wearing magnetic boots and did this.
Aren't you carrying a surgeon?
We were until this disgrace.
Well, then for God sakes, man, let me help.
I've got a pulse. We can move him.
I'm gonna need some light.
Can we get him up on this table?
Hold him. Hold him while I stabilize him.
I said hold him.
Sweet Jesus.
- Can you...
- Jim, I don't even know his anatomy.
- His wounds are not closing.
- He's killing him!
He's gone into some kind of damned arrest.
Come on, damn it! Come on!
He's not responding.
Don't let it end this way, Captain.
Under article number 184 of your interstellar law,
I'm placing you under arrest.
You are charged with assassinating our Chancellor of the High Council.
He tried to save him.
They've been arrested.
Mr. Spock, we've got to do something.
I assume command of this ship as of 0230 hours.
Commander Uhura, please notify Starfleet Headquarters.
Tell them precisely what has taken place
- and request instructions.
- Aye, sir.
We cannot allow them to be taken back to Kronos as prisoners.
What do you suggest, Lieutenant?
Opening fire will not retrieve them, and an armed conflict is precisely what the Captain wished to avoid.
We will be able to follow the Captain's movements.
- How did you achieve this, sir?
- Time is precious, Lieutenant.
We must endeavor to piece together what happened here tonight.
According to our databank, this ship fired those torpedoes.
No way.
I sympathize, Mr. Scott, but we need evidence.
Please accompany me.
And if we cannot piece together what happened?
- What then, sir?
- In that case, Mr. Chekov, it resides in the purview of the diplomats.
The Chancellor of the High Council is dead!
The result of an unprovoked attack while he travelled to see you under a flag of truce, on a mission of peace.
Captain Kirk was legally arrested for the crime.
May I remind you that he and Dr McCoy boarded Kronos One of their own free will?
None of these facts are in dispute,
Mr. President.
I have ordered a full-scale investigation.
- In the meantime...
- In the meantime, we expect the Federation to abide by the articles of interstellar law, which you claim to cherish.
Kirk and Dr McCoy will stand trial for the assassination of Chancellor Gorkon.
Out of the question.
Ambassador Sarek, there must be some way to extradite these men.
Mr. President, I share a measure of personal responsibility in this matter, but I am obliged to confirm my esteemed colleague's legal interpretation.
What is the position of the Romulan government,
Ambassador Nanclus?
I must concur with my colleagues.
But you can't possibly believe that James Kirk assassinated the Chancellor of the High Council.
Mr. President,
I don't know what to believe.
I'm waiting for your answer, sir.
This president is not above the law.
Report back at once. Do you copy?
At once.
Enterprise to report back on the double.
Do you read? At once.
We're to report back at once.
We cannot abandon
Captain Kirk and Dr McCoy.
Of course not.
Four hundred years ago on the planet Earth, workers who felt their livelihood threatened by automation flung their wooden shoes called "sabot" into the machines to stop them.
Hence the word "sabotage."
We are experiencing technical malfunction.
All backup systems inoperative.
Excellent. I mean, too bad.
Mr. President,
I've been named Chancellor by the High Council in my father's place.
Madam Chancellor, you have my sincerest condolences on your recent loss.
I want to assure you that this shameful deed will not...
Mr. President, let us come to the point.
You want this conference to go forward, and so did my father.
I will attend in one week on one condition.
We will not extradite the prisoners, and you will make no attempt to rescue them in a military operation.
We would consider any such attempt an act of war.
We hope you'll be our guest here on Earth.
After recent events, you will understand if I say I prefer a neutral site, and in the interests of security, let us keep the location secret for now.
As you wish, Madam Chancellor.
Attack them now, while we still can!
Attack or be slaves in their world.
We can take whole by force, what they propose to divide.
War is obsolete, General, as we are in danger of becoming.
Better to die on our feet than live on our knees.
That wasn't what my father wanted.
Your father was killed for what he wanted.
The peace process will go forward.
Kirk...
Kirk will pay for my father's death.
- Kirk! Kirk!
- Kirk! Kirk!
- Kirk! Kirk! Kirk! Kirk!
- Kirk! Kirk! Kirk! Kirk!
- Kirk! Kirk! Kirk! Kirk!
- Kirk! Kirk! Kirk! Kirk!
- Kirk! Kirk! Kirk! Kirk!
- Kirk! Kirk! Kirk! Kirk!
- Kirk! Kirk! Kirk! Kirk!
- Kirk! Kirk! Kirk! Kirk!
It's a damn show trial.
- Kirk! Kirk!
- Kirk! Kirk!
The Enterprise fired on Kronos One without provocation.
The Chancellor and his advisers...
...having been lulled into a false sense of security by an invitation to a state dinner aboard Captain Kirk's vessel at precisely 1930 hours that same evening.
Call your first witness.
After the first shot, we lost our gravitational field.
I found myself weightless and unable to function.
Then two Starfleet crewmen came walking towards me.
But perhaps they merely wore
Starfleet uniforms.
That remark is purely speculative.
I move that it be stricken.
Colonel Worf, we are interested in facts, not theories.
If the gravitational unit was not functioning, how could these men be walking?
They appeared to be wearing magnetic boots.
Gravity boots.
Dr McCoy, would you be so good as to tell me, what is your current medical status?
Aside from a touch of arthritis,
I'd say pretty good.
You have a singular wit, Doctor.
For 27 years, I've been ship surgeon aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise.
In three months, I stand down.
You know, I believe that you consumed a rather generous amount of Romulan ale in the officers' mess on the night in question.
Am I right, Doctor?
- Objection!
- Sustained.
We all did. All of us.
- That doesn't mean...
- Was Chancellor Gorkon alive when you first examined him?
- Barely.
- Now be careful, Doctor.
Have you ever, in your past, saved patients as barely alive as he?
I didn't have the medical knowledge
I needed for Klingon anatomy.
- I see.
- You were there.
You say you are due for retirement.
May I ask, do your hands shake?
- Objection!
- I was nervous.
No.
You were incompetent.
You were incompetent!
Whether deliberately or as a result of age combined with drink,
- the court will have to determine.
- My God, man! I tried to save him!
I tried to save him.
I was desperate to save him.
He was the last best hope in the universe for peace.
The witness is excused.
There we have it, citizens.
We have finally established the particulars of the crime, and now we come to the architect of this tragic affair,
James Tiberius Kirk.
What would your favorite author say, Captain?
"Let us sit upon the ground
"and tell sad stories of the death of kings."
Tell us your sad story, Kirk.
Tell us that you planned to take revenge for the death of your son.
- That's not true.
- Objection!
Captain Kirk has not been identified as the assassin.
Sustained.
I offer into the record this excerpt from the Captain's personal log.
I've never trusted Klingons, and I never will.
I have never been able to forgive them for the death of my boy.
Again. Again!
I've never trusted Klingons, and I never will.
I have never been able to forgive them for the death of my boy.
Are those your words?
Those words were spoken by me.
Objection!
My client's political views are not on trial here.
On the contrary!
Captain Kirk's views and motives are indeed at the very heart of the matter.
This officer's record shows him to be an insubordinate, unprincipled, career-minded opportunist, with a history of violating the chain of command whenever it suited him!
Continue.
Indeed, the record shows that Captain Kirk once held the rank of Admiral, and that Admiral Kirk was broken for taking matters into his own hands in defiance of regulations of the law.
Do you deny being demoted for these charges?
Don't wait for the translation!
Answer me now!
I cannot deny it.
- You were demoted?
- Yes.
- For insubordination?
- On occasion, I have disobeyed orders.
And were you obeying or disobeying orders when you arranged the assassination of Chancellor Gorkon?
I didn't know about the assassination until we boarded the ship.
You still deny the Enterprise fired on Kronos One?
- Well...
- Your Honors, please!
And you still deny your men beamed aboard and shot the Chancellor?
Objection!
I cannot confirm or deny actions
I did not witness.
Captain Kirk, are you aware that as the captain of a starship, you are required to be responsible for the actions of your men?
I am.
And if it should be proved that members of your crew did, in fact, carry out such an assassination...
Jim, they're setting us up.
Your Honors...
Do not answer!
Captain Kirk, you will answer the question.
As captain,
I am responsible for the conduct of the crew under my command.
Your Honors, the State rests.
Send to Commander Enterprise.
"We stand ready to assist you.
Captain Sulu, U.S.S. Excelsior. "
It is the determination of this court that the prisoners are guilty as charged.
I wish to note for the record that the evidence against my clients is entirely circumstantial.
I beg the court to consider this when pronouncing its sentence.
So noted.
Captain James T. Kirk,
Dr Leonard McCoy, in the interest of fostering amity for the forthcoming peace talks, the sentence of death is commuted.
It is the judgment of this court that, without possibility of reprieve or parole, you be taken from this place to the dilithium mines on the penal asteroid of Rura Penthe, there to spend the rest of your natural lives.
Rura Penthe?
Known throughout the galaxy as the aliens' graveyard.
Better to kill them now and get it over with.
Lieutenant, the torpedo hit once again, please.
Hold.
It is Enterprise.
- We fired.
- That is not possible.
All weapons visually accounted for, sir.
An ancestor of mine maintained that if you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.
What exactly does that mean?
It means that if we cannot have fired those torpedoes, someone else did.
Well, they did not fire on themselves, and there were no other ships present.
There was an enormous neutron energy surge.
Not from us!
A neutron surge that big could only be produced by another ship.
Kronos One?
Too far away.
Very near us. Possibly beneath us.
If there were a ship beneath us, the Klingons would have seen her.
Would they?
- A bird-of-prey.
- A bird-of-prey.
Cloaked?
A bird-of-prey cannot fire when she's cloaked.
All things being equal, Mr. Scott,
I would agree.
However, things are not equal.
This one can.
We must inform Starfleet Command.
Inform them of what, a new weapon that is invisible?
Raving lunatics, that's what they'll call us.
They'll say that we're so desperate to exonerate the Captain that we'll say anything.
And they would be correct.
We have no evidence, only a theory which happens to fit the facts.
Assuming you're right, Mr. Spock, why would they fire on their own president?
Indeed.
This ship will be searched from bow to stern.
Lieutenant Valeris, you'll be in charge.
- Aye, sir.
- I do not understand.
If there was a ship underneath us, surely the assassins beamed aboard from that vessel, not Enterprise.
You're forgetting something,
Mr. Chekov.
According to our databanks, this ship fired those torpedoes.
If we did, the killers are here.
If we did not, whoever altered the databanks is here.
In either case, what we are looking for is here.
What are we looking for, sir?
Lieutenant?
Two pairs of gravity boots.
This is the gulag Rura Penthe.
There is no stockade, no guard tower, no electronic frontier.
Only a magnetic shield prevents beaming.
Punishment means exile from prison to the surface.
On the surface, nothing can survive.
Work well and you will be treated well.
Work badly and you will die.
Oh, my God.
The universal translator's been confiscated.
I'm sorry?
He's definitely on about something, Jim.
If this is your spot, we'll move on.
He wants your obedience to the brotherhood of aliens.
- He's got it.
- And your coat.
I'm afraid not. Besides, it wouldn't fit.
Thanks.
This will help keep you warm.
I'm Martia.
You're Kirk and McCoy, I presume.
How'd you know that?
We don't get many presidential assassins.
- We didn't kill Gorkon.
- Of course not,
- but there is a reward for your death.
- It figures.
We've been set up all along.
Somebody up there wants you out of the way.
- Nothing in here.
- Nothing here.
- Any progress?
- None.
We have a crew of 300 turning their own quarters inside out, but the killers may still be among them.
Surely they have disposed of these boots by now.
Would it not have been logical to have left them on Gorkon's ship?
Even logic must give way to physics.
Gravity had not been restored by the time they escaped.
Without the boots, they would have floated off the Klingon transporter pads.
Why not simply vaporize them?
Like this?
At ease.
As you know, Commander Chekov, no one can fire an unauthorized phaser aboard a starship.
Suppose when they returned, they threw the boots into the refuse.
I'm having the refuse searched.
If my surmise is correct, those boots will cling to the killers' necks like a pair of Tiberian bats.
They could not make their escape without them, nor can they simply throw them out the window for all to see.
- Those boots are here somewhere.
- Did someone fire off a phaser?
It's all right. It's nothing. It's nothing.
Mr. Spock, Starfleet is screaming for us to return to port.
- Who fired that...
- Mr. Scott.
I understand you're having difficulty with the warp drive.
How much time do you require for repair?
There's nothing wrong with the bloody thing.
Mr. Scott, if we return to spacedock, the assassins will surely find a way to dispose of their incriminating footwear, and we will never see the Captain or Dr McCoy alive again.
- It could take weeks, sir.
- Thank you, Mr. Scott.
Valeris, please inform
Starfleet Command
- our warp drive is inoperative.
- A lie?
An error.
You understand we have lost all contact with the Captain and Dr McCoy.
Yes. At the moment, they're surrounded by a magnetic shield.
However, if I know the Captain, by this time, he is deep into planning his escape.
You got him, Jim!
You got him where you want him!
- You all right, Jim?
- I think so.
- They'll respect you now.
- That's a comfort.
- I was lucky that thing had knees.
- That was not his knee.
Not everybody keeps their genitals in the same place, Captain.
Anything you want to tell me?
Bones, why don't you see what you can do for him?
Let him know we're not holding a grudge.
Suppose he's holding a grudge?
When whoever it is makes their move, you won't be here to ask if he's the one.
- Do you want to get out of here?
- There's gotta be a way.
Three months before retirement.
What a way to finish.
- We're not finished.
- No? Speak for yourself.
One day, one night, Kobayashi Maru.
Bones, are you afraid of the future?
I believe that was the general idea that I was trying to convey.
I don't mean this future.
- What is this, multiple choice?
- Some people are afraid of what might happen.
I was terrified.
What terrified you, specifically?
No more neutral zone.
I was used to hating Klingons.
It never even occurred to me to take Gorkon at his word.
Spock was right.
Try not to be too hard on yourself.
We all felt exactly the same.
No.
Somebody felt a lot worse.
I'm beginning to understand why.
Well, if you've got any bright ideas, now's the time.
Time's the problem.
You and I are nothing.
But you heard the judge.
The peace conference is on again.
Whoever killed Gorkon is bound to attempt another assassination.
Unless we can get out of here.
Kirk, it's me, Martia.
Listen, no one has ever escaped from Rura Penthe.
- Except us.
- It is possible.
- I know how to get outside the shield.
- How do we fit in?
Getting outside the shield is easy, but after that, it's up to you to get us off the surface before we freeze.
Can you?
- It's possible.
- I can't make it alone, and you're likeliest candidate to come in this hellhole for months.
Candidate for what?
Go to lift seven in the morning for mining duty.
I'll see you there. Don't disappoint me.
- What is it with you, anyway?
- Still think we're finished?
More than ever.
- I'm sorry to wake you, sir.
- What is it?
Starfleet urgently requests any data we have on the whereabouts of Enterprise.
What?
Well, apparently, they're refusing to acknowledge signal to return to spacedock, sir.
Signal Starfleet that we have no idea location Enterprise.
Sir?
- You have hearing problems, mister?
- No, sir.
Klingon blood.
They must have walked through it when it was floating and tracked it back here.
This is the first evidence which corroborates our theory.
Now we go to Starfleet.
Now we expand our search to include uniforms.
All uniforms?
Take those out.
- Continue scanning.
- Nothing, sir.
Clear, sir.
Coming through. Coming through.
Computer well seven clear.
Nothing. Nothing.
Okay, let's see what we got.
Nothing. Nothing so far.
Sir! Sir!
- I think we've been had.
- No, you weren't, Doctor.
Get off at the first level.
Follow the gang into the mine.
They don't take girls.
You are Crewman Dax?
Yes, Commander. What is the problem?
Perhaps you know
Russian epic of Cinderella?
If shoe fits, wear it.
Mr. Chekov.
Watch me.
What kind of creature is this?
Last night, you two were...
Don't remind me.
Get in.
Come on. We don't have a lot of time.
Hurry.
Up there.
Come on, climb.
Here. You'll need these. Quickly!
Stay close.
There they are.
They're emerging from the beaming shield.
- Mr. Scott, start your engines.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Mr. Chekov, set course for Rura Penthe.
Mr. Spock, Rura Penthe is deep inside the Klingon frontier.
- If we are discovered...
- Quite correct, Mr. Chekov.
What is required now is a feat of linguistic legerdemain and a degree of intrepidity before the Captain and Dr McCoy freeze to death.
- Leave me. I'm finished.
- No!
Bones, I'm wearing a viridium patch on my back.
Spock slapped it there just before we went on Gorkon's ship.
- Why, that cunning little Vulcan.
- Come on. We're in the clear.
Now that we're outside the shield, they'll be able to locate us two sectors away.
If they're even looking for us.
This is listening post Morska.
What ship is that? Over.
We must respond personally.
A universal translator would be recognized.
We am thy freighter Ursva.
Six weeks out of
Kronos.
What is your destination? Over.
We is condemning food, things and supplies.
Don't catch any bugs!
Would you mind explaining that little trick you do?
- I'm a chameloid.
- I've heard about you.
Shapeshifters.
- I thought you were mythical.
- Give a girl a chance, Captain.
- It takes a lot of effort.
- I don't doubt it.
Stop me if I'm wrong, but do we have any way of knowing whether this is the real you?
I thought I would assume a pleasing shape.
We're outside the shield.
Now it's your turn, Captain.
If you say so.
Are you crazy?
She didn't need our help getting anywhere.
Where'd you get these convenient clothes?
Don't tell me that flare is standard prison issue.
It's to let them know where we are.
Ask her what she's getting in return.
A full pardon, which doesn't cover this.
An accident wasn't good enough.
Come on, Spock.
Good enough for one.
Two would have looked suspicious.
Killed while attempting escape.
Now that's convincing for both.
Surprise!
- Your friends are late.
- They'll be along.
- I can't believe I kissed you.
- Must have been your lifelong ambition.
Isn't it about time you became something else?
I like it here.
Well, well, well.
What took you so long?
- Kill him. He's the one.
- Not me, you idiot. Him!
- No witnesses.
- Killed while trying to escape.
- Damn clever, if you ask me.
- It's a classic.
- That's what he wanted.
- Who? Who wanted us killed?
Since you're all going to die anyway, why not tell you?
His name is...
Damn it to hell! Of all the... Son of a...
- Couldn't you have waited two seconds?
- Captain?
He was just about to explain the whole thing.
You want to go back?
- Absolutely not!
- It's cold.
This is the Bridge.
We are still in Klingon space.
Deck 9, remain at battle stations.
Deck 9, remain at battle stations.
They were beamed aboard a Federation starship.
I could trace...
Escaped.
Kirk cannot know the location of the peace conference.
Are you sure?
Will you take that chance?
Helmsman, make course to intercept Enterprise.
The Klingons have a new weapon, a bird-of-prey that can fire when cloaked.
- She torpedoed Gorkon's ship.
- So that's it.
Not entirely. I have reason to believe that Gorkon's murderers
- are aboard this vessel.
- I have a thought about that.
Has the peace conference begun?
Who knows?
They're keeping the location secret.
- There's always something.
- Captain!
Mr. Spock! I found the missing uniforms with the Klingon blood on them.
But the uniforms belong to these two men,
Burke and Samno.
Not anymore.
Phaser on stun at close range.
First rule of assassination, kill the assassins.
- Now we're back to square one.
- Can I talk to you?
I wonder why they weren't vaporized.
It would set off the alarm.
It's possible.
Now hear this. Now hear this.
Court reporter to sickbay.
Code Blue. Urgent.
Statements to be taken at once from yeomen Burke and Samno.
Repeat. Court reporter to sickbay.
Code Blue. Urgent.
Statements to be taken.
Repeat. Statements to be taken from yeomen Burke and Samno.
You have to shoot.
If you are logical, you have to shoot.
I do not want to.
What you want is irrelevant.
What you've chosen is at hand.
I'd just as soon you didn't.
The operation is over.
I did not fire. You cannot prove anything.
Yes, I can. At my trial, my personal log was used against me.
How long did you wait outside my quarters before I noticed you?
You knew?
I tried to tell you, but you would not listen.
Neither of us was hearing very well that night, Lieutenant.
There were things I tried to tell you about having faith.
You have betrayed the Federation.
All of you.
And what do you think you've been doing?
Saving Starfleet.
Klingons cannot be trusted.
Sir.
You said so yourself.
They killed your son.
Did you not wish Gorkon dead?
"Let them die," you said.
Did I misinterpret you?
And you were right.
They conspired with us to assassinate their own chancellor.
How trustworthy can they be?
Klingons and Federation members conspiring together?
Who is "us"?
Everyone who stands to lose from peace.
- Names, Lieutenant.
- My comrades will make certain all your ship-to-shore transmissions are jammed.
Names, Lieutenant.
I do not remember.
A lie?
A choice.
Spock?
Admiral Cartwright.
From Starfleet?
Who else?
- General...
- General...
- ...Chang.
- ...Chang.
Who else?
- Romulan...
- Romulan...
- ...Ambassador...
- ...Ambassador...
- ...Nanclus.
- ...Nanclus.
Where is the peace conference?
Where is the peace conference?
She does not know.
Then we're dead.
I've been dead before.
Contact Excelsior.
- She'll have the coordinates.
- I've already got him, sir.
Standing by, Captain Kirk.
Sulu!
You realize that by even talking to us, you're violating regulations.
I'm sorry, Captain.
Your message is breaking up.
Bless you, Sulu.
Where is the peace conference?
They're going to attempt another assassination.
The conference is at Camp Khitomer, near the Romulan border.
I'm sending the exact coordinates on a coded frequency.
I'm afraid we're gonna need more than that.
There's a bird-of-prey on the lookout for us, and she can fire while cloaked.
Surely not.
Hold on.
How many of those things are there?
Come on, Lieutenant.
- Just the prototype.
- You hear that?
I'm getting underway now, but we're now in Alpha Quadrant.
The chances of our reaching the conference in time are slim.
When does this conference start?
According to my information, today.
Thank you, Captain Sulu.
Don't mention it, Captain Kirk.
Spock?
I prefer it dark.
Dining on ashes?
You were right.
It was arrogant presumption on my part that got us into this situation.
You and the doctor might have been killed.
The night is young.
You said it yourself. It was logical.
Peace is worth a few personal risks.
You're a great one for logic.
I'm a great one for rushing in where angels fear to tread.
We're both extremists.
Reality is probably somewhere in between.
I couldn't get past the death of my son.
I was prejudiced by her accomplishments as a Vulcan.
Gorkon had to die before I understood how prejudiced I was.
Is it possible that we two, you and I, have grown so old and so inflexible that we have outlived our usefulness?
Would that constitute a joke?
Don't crucify yourself.
It wasn't your fault.
I was responsible.
- For no actions but your own.
- That is not what you said at your trial.
That was as captain of the ship.
Human beings...
But, Captain, we both know that I am not human.
Spock, you want to know something?
Everybody's human.
I find that remark insulting.
Come on. I need you.
Madam Chancellor, members of the Diplomatic Corps, honored guests, the United Federation of Planets welcomes you to Camp Khitomer.
She's out here somewhere.
But if she is cloaked...
Then all we have is a neutron radiation surge, and by the time we're close enough to record it, we're ashes.
- Close enough to beam down?
- Not yet, Captain. In two minutes. 158.
- Go to impulse power for Khitomer orbit.
- Aye, sir.
Let us redefine progress to mean that just because we can do a thing, it does not necessarily follow that we must do that thing.
- Uhura?
- Nothing, Captain.
If she's here, she's rigged for silent running.
Coming up on transporter range in 57 seconds.
Transporter Room, stand by to beam down.
...48 seconds.
I can see you, Kirk.
Chang.
Can you see me?
Now, be honest, Captain.
Warrior to warrior, you do prefer it this way, don't you?
As it was meant to be.
No peace in our time.
"Once more unto the breach, dear friends."
- This is fun.
- Reverse engines. All astern.
One and a half impulse power.
Back off! Back off!
What's she doing?
What's she waiting for?
Probably attempting to ascertain why we are reversing, wondering whether we detect her.
Incoming!
- In range?
- Not yet, sir.
Come on. Come on.
- She'll fly apart.
- Fly her apart, then!
Many speculated about my father's motives.
There were those who said he was an idealist.
Others said he had no choice.
If Praxis had not exploded, then quite possibly his idealism would not have found expression.
We are a proud race, and we are here because we intend to go on being proud.
- Go to auxiliary power!
- Auxiliary circuits destroyed, Captain.
"Tickle us, do we not laugh?
Prick us, do we not bleed?
"Wrong us,
"shall we not revenge?"
Gas.
Gas, Captain. Under impulse power, she expends fuel like any other vessel.
We call it plasma, but whatever the Klingon designation, it is merely ionized gas.
Well, what about all of that equipment we're carrying to catalogue gaseous anomalies?
- Well, the thing's gotta have a tailpipe.
- Doctor, would you care to assist me
- in performing surgery on a torpedo?
- Fascinating.
Hard to starboard!
The proposed agenda is as follows.
The total evacuation of Kronos has been calculated within the 50-Earth-year time span.
Phase one, preparation for evacuation.
Come on, reach up!
Captain! She's packing quite a wallop!
Shields weakening!
Shields up. All right.
Now we've given them something else to shoot at.
Aye, sir.
The game's afoot, huh?
- Excelsior's been hit.
- "Our revels now are ended," Kirk.
"Cry 'Havoc!' and let slip the dogs of war."
Bones, where's my torpedo?
Bet you wish you'd stood in bed.
Emergency power!
Gravity control down!
Shields collapsing!
The key, please, Doctor. Time is short.
The hull has been compromised.
- I wonder how bad?
- Connect echobars.
...to discuss the report on phase two.
- Alter circuit "A."
- Sensor.
I propose that we commence with the minutes of the preparation.
"I am constant as the northern star."
I'd give real money if he'd shut up.
- Plate, please.
- Plate.
...and assimilation will consume...
We've got a heartbeat.
The Klingon empire, the ecological...
- Key, please.
- Key.
Where's that damn torpedo?
She's ready, Jim. Lock and load.
Fire.
To be, or not to be.
Target that explosion and fire.
Fire.
As I imagine this work will occupy us throughout most of the week, it would be my hope that the delegation could return to their capitals to implement the provisions of phase one, no later than the first of next month.
Scotty.
As you know, time is of the essence.
- Out of the way!
- Out of the way!
Mr. President!
Mr. President! Mr. President!
Mr. President!
Kirk, Enterprise.
Protect the Chancellor!
- Arrest those men!
- Arrest yourself.
We've got a full confession.
Cartwright, just a minute.
What's happened?
What's the meaning of all of this?
It's about the future, Madam Chancellor.
Some people think the future means the end of history.
Well, we haven't run out of history quite yet.
Your father called the future the undiscovered country.
People can be very frightened of change.
You've restored my father's faith.
And you've restored my son's.
Once again, we've saved civilization as we know it.
And the good news is, they're not going to prosecute.
They might as well have prosecuted me.
I felt like Lieutenant Valeris.
Well, they don't arrest people for having feelings.
And it's a good thing, too. If they did, we'd all have to turn ourselves in.
Captain Kirk.
Captain Sulu.
As much to the crew of the Enterprise,
I owe you my thanks.
Nice to see you in action one more time, Captain Kirk.
Take care.
By God, that's a big ship.
- Not so big as her captain, I think.
- So, this is goodbye.
I think it's about time we got underway ourselves.
Captain, I have orders from Starfleet Command.
We're to put back to spacedock immediately to be decommissioned.
If I were human,
I believe my response would be,
"Go to hell."
If I were human.
Course heading, Captain?
Second star to the right, and straight on till morning.
Captain's Log, Stardate 9529.1.
This is the final cruise of the Starship Enterprise under my command.
This ship and her history will shortly become the care of another crew.
To them and their posterity will we commit our future.
They will continue the voyages we have begun, and journey to all the undiscovered countries, boldly going where no man...
Where no one has gone before.

Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to my underground lair.
I have gathered here before me the world's deadliest assassins.
And yet each of you has failed to kill Austin PoWers.
That makes me angry.
And when Dr. Evil gets angry,
Mr. Bigglesworth gets upset.
And when Mr. Bigglesworth gets upset...
...people die!
Why must I be surrounded by fricking idiots?
Mustafa, Frau Farbissina.
I spared your lives because I need you to help me...
...rid the world of Britain's top secret agent.

We must kill Austin Powers.
- Yeah.
Oh! It's Austin.
Oh, it's Austin.
Come on, babies.
Work with me, people. All right.
Show me love.
Great, baby, yeah.
Oh, behave.
It's Austin Powers!
Yeah.
- It's Austin PoWers!
- Aah! Oh, my God!
- Hllo, Mrs. Kensington.
- Hello, Austin.
Why don't you ever model for me,
Mrs. Kensington?
You know how Mr. Kensington feels about that.
Oh, behave.
Yeah. Yeah, baby, yeah.
Hello, Austin. I'm Basil Exposition,
With British Intelligence.
We have just received word that Dr. Evil is planning a trap for you tonight...
...at the Electric Psychedelic
Pussycat Swinger's Club...
...here in swinging London.
We'll be there.
Yeah, come on, baby.
There you go.
Come on swingers, yeah. Yeah.
Austin, it's a swinging shindig.
It's my happening, baby, and it freaks me out.
Yeah, man!
- Can I get you a drink, Mr. Powers?
- Sure.
Austin, we've got to look for Dr. Evil.
Wait, I've got an idea.
Austin, why on Earth did you hit that woman?
Right. Let me show you, baby.
That ain't no woman. It's a man, man.
It's one of Dr. Evil's assassins.
Look out, he's got a knife!
Good Work, Mrs. Kensington.
All right, get up. Get up!
Right. Where's Dr. Evil, huh?
Where is he?
There's the bastard.
Come on, let's go.
Excuse me, coming through.
Excuse me.
- I've got you now, Dr. Evil.
Not this time.
Come, Mr. Bigglesworth.
See you in the future, Mr. Powers.
My God, he's freezing himself.
Oh, my God, look!
And so Dr. Evil escaped and had himself cryogenically frozen...
...to return at a time when free love no longer reigned...
...and greed and corruption ruled again.
Yes?
- Commander Gilmour?
- Speaking.
Commander, this is Ritter in SoWest Com Three.
We have a potential bogey with erratic vectoring and an unorthodox entry angle.
What are you saying, son?
Well, it appears to be in the shape of a Big Boy.
Good God, he's back.
Well, in many ways, the Big Boy never leff, sir.
He's always offered the same high-quality meals at competitive prices.
- Shut up.
- Shall I scramble TacHO for an intercept?
- What's its current position?
- Well, I'm presently tracking it over Nevada.
Oh, my God. The Big Boy's gone.
Listen, son, I want you to forget what you saW here today.
Philips.
- Call the President.
- Yes, sir.
Prepare the jet. Bring my overnight bag.
And, uh, Philips, feed my fish.
Not too much.
I'm off to London, England.
Powers volunteered to have himself frozen...
...in case Dr. Evil should ever return.
Well, I hope your boy's up to it.
We don't Wanna have to bail you guys out again, like after WWII.
This is our celebrity vault.

I don't want Smarties,
I want a Mars bar, Mommy.
Wh...? Where am I?
You're in the Ministry of Defense.
It's 1997.
You've been cryogenically frozen for 30 years.
Who are these people?!
The shouting is a temporary side effect of the unfreezing process.
Yes, I'm having difficulty controlling the volume of my voice!
This is Commander Gilmour,
U.S. Strategic Command...
...and General Borschevsky,
Russian Intelligence.
Russian Intelligence, are you mad?
A lot's happened since you were frozen.
The Cold War's over.
Well, finally those capitalist pigs will pay for their crimes, eh?
- Hey, Comrades? Hey?
- Austin, we won.
Oh, groovy. Smashing. Yea, capitalism.
Hello. Hello.
Mr. Powers!
The President's quite concerned.
We've got a madman on the loose in Nevada.
Dr. Evil. When do I begin?
Immediately.
You'll be working with Ms. Kensington.
Mrs. Kensington.
Austin,
Mrs. Kensington has long since retired.
Ms. Kensington is her daughter.
Ah, here she is.
Vanessa is one of our top agents.
My God, Vanessa's got a fabulous body.
I'll bet she shags like a minx.
How do I tell them that because of the unfreezing process...
...I have no inner monologue?
I hope I didn't say that out loud just noW.
Mr. Powers, my job is to acclimatize you to the '90s.
You know, a lot's changed since 1967.
No doubt, love, but as long as people are still having promiscuous sex...
...with many anonymous partners without protection...
...while at the same time experimenting With mind-expanding drugs...
...in a consequence-free environment,
I'll be sound as a pound.
- Danger Powers' personal effects.
- Actually, my name is Austin Powers.
- It says here, "Name: Danger Powers."
- No, no, no.
Danger's my middle name.
Okay, Austin Danger Powers:
- One blue crushed-velvet suit.
- Hey, all right.
- One frilly lace cravat.
- There it is.
One silver medallion with male symbol.
- One pair of Italian boots.
- Buongiorno, boys.
One vinyl record album:
Burt Bacharach Plays His Hits.
Hey, Burt. How are you?
- One Swedish-made penis-enlarger pump.
That's not mine.
One credit card receipt for Swedish-made penis-enlarger...
...signed by Austin Powers.
I'm telling you, baby, that's not mine.
One warranty card for Swedish-made penis-enlarger pump...
...filled out by Austin PoWers.
I don't even know what this is.
This sort of thing ain't my bag, baby.
One book: Swedish-Made
Penis Enlarger Pumps and Me:
This Sort of Thing Is My Bag, Baby, by Austin Powers.
- Just sign the form.
- Okay, don't get heavy, man. I'll sign.
You know, just to get things moving, you know.
You all right, baby?
Listen, Mr. Powers,
I look forWard to Working With you...
...but do me a favor and stop calling me baby.
- You can address me as Agent Kensington.
- Oh, come on.
- All right, then. Vanessa.
- Was that so hard?
Now, come along.
We have to leave immediately.
We've preserved your private jet just as you left it.
- It's waiting at Heathrow Airport.
- My jumbo jet? Smashing, baby.
Ooh, sorry.
Mr. Powers.
Quickly.
Quickly, come on, noW. Let's go.
Gentiemen, welcome to my underground lair.
It's been 30 years, but I'm back.
Everything's gone perfectly to plan except for one small flaw.
Due to a technical error by my henchman, Mustafa...
...complications arose in the unfreezing process.
- My design Was perfect.
- Look what you did to Mr. Bigglesworth!
But, Dr. Evil, we were unable to anticipate feline complications...
...due to the reanimation process.
Silence!
Let this be a reminder to you all...
...that this organization will not tolerate failure.
Gentlemen, let's get down to business.
- We've got a lot of work to do.
Someone help me.
I'm still alive, only I'm very badly burned.
Some of you I know.
Some of you I'm meeting for the first time.
Aah. Hello up there. Anyone?
Could someone call an ambulance?
I'm in quite a lot of pain.
Okay, you've all been gathered here to form my evil cabinet...
Excuse me.
- Yes, he's down there.
Is he dead yet?
No, not dead. No, burnt, badly.
Should I take care of him, possibly with a gun?
- Yes.
- Kill him?
Right.
If somebody could open the retrieval hatch down here...
...I could get out.
See, I designed this device myself.
Oh, hi. Good. I'm glad you found me.
Listen, I'm very badly burned, so if you could just...
You shot me!
- Okay, moving on.
You shot me right in the arm! Why did...?
Right. Let me go around the table and introduce everyone.
Frau Farbissina, founder of the militant wing of the Salvation Army.
Random Task, Korean ex-wrestler, evil handyman extraordinaire.
Random Task, show them what you do.
Patty O'Brien, ex-Irish assassin.
His trademark, a superstitious man, he leaves a tiny keepsake...
...from his good-luck bracelet on every victim he kills.
Scotland Yard Would love to get their hands on that piece of evidence.
Yeah, they're alWays after me lucky charms.
What? Why does everyone always laugh when I say that?
They are after me lucky charms.
What?
It's a television commercial, with this cartoon leprechaun.
And all of these children are trying to chase him.
"Hey, leprechaun man, leprechaun man.
We want to get your lucky charms."
Ha, ha. Oh, and there's all of these little tiny bits of marshmalloWs...
...just stuck right in the cereal, so that When the kids eat them, they think:
"Oh, this is candy. I'm having fun."
Finally we come to my number-two man.
His name?
Number TWo.
For 30 years, Number Two has run Virtucon, the legitimate face of my evil empire.
Dr. Evil, over the last 30 years,
Virtucon has grown by leaps and bounds.
About 15 years ago, we changed from volatile chemicals...
...to the communications industry.
We own cable companies in 38 states.
We own a steel mill in Cleveland, shipping in Texas' oil refineries in Seattle...
...and a factory in Chicago that makes miniature models of factories.
Naturally, yes.
Gentlemen.
I have a plan.
It's called blackmail.
As you know, the royal family of Britain are the wealthiest landowners in the world.
Either the royal family pays us an exorbitant amount of money...
...or we make it seem that Prince Charles has had an affair outside of marriage...
...and therefore, would have to divorce.
Prince Charles did have an affair, he admitted it, and they are noW divorced.
Right. Okay, you have to tell me these things.
All right?
I've been frozen for 30 years, okay?
Throw me a fricking bone here.
I'm the boss. Need the info.
Okay, no problem.
Here's my second plan.
Back in the '60s,
I developed a weather-changing machine...
...which was, in essence, a sophisticated heat beam...
...which we called a "laser."
Using these "lasers," we punch a hole in the protective layer around the world...
...which we call the "ozone layer."
Slowly, but surely, ultraviolet rays would pour in...
...increasing the risk of skin cancer, that is, unless...
...the world pays us a hefty ransom?
That also already has happened.
Shit.
Oh, hell, let's just do what We alWays do:
Hijack some nuclear weapons and hold the world hostage, yeah? Good.
Gentlemen, it's come to my attention...
...that a breakaway Russian republic,
Kreplachistan, is about to transfer...
...a nuclear warhead to the United Nations in a few days. Here's the plan.
We get the warhead and we hold the world ransom for...
...$1 million.
Well, don't you think We should, maybe, ask for more than a million dollars?
A million dollars isn't exactly a lot of money these days.
Virtucon alone makes over $9 billion a year.
Really? That's a lot of money.
Okay, then.
We hold the World ransom for...
...$100 billion.
Pretty groovy jumbo jet, eh?
When you see this jet a-rocking don't come a-knocking, baby, yeah.
I'm gonna need you to sign these release forms.
- Release forms?
- You're not officially...
...working for the Ministry of Defense.
These forms indemnify the Ministry...
...against any, um, mishaps that may occur in the line of duty.
Mishaps? But isn't that what being an international man of mystery is all about?
Okay, name: Austin Danger Powers.
Sex: Yes, please.
How does a hot chick like you end up working at the Ministry of Defense?
Oh, well, I went to Oxford where I excelled in several subjects...
...but I ended up specializing in foreign languages.
You know, I really wanted to travel.
You know, sort of see the World.
That's fascinating, Vanessa. Listen, why don't We go in the back and shag?
- What?
- I've been frozen for 30 years.
I've gotta see if my bits and pieces are still working.
- Excuse me?
- My Wedding tackle.
- I'm sorry.
- My meat and two veg.
My twig and berries.
- Hello, lads, are you still awake?
- Mr. Powers, Mr. PoWers, please.
I'd appreciate it if you could concentrate on our mission...
...and give your libido a rest.
Can I, uh...?
Can I show you something?
I won't bite, hard.
All right.
Let me ask you a question, and be honest.
Do I make you horny? Randy?
Do I make you horny, baby? Yeah, do I?
God, I hope this is part of the unfreezing process.
Oh, turbulence. Oh, look at that.
Oh, turbulence. Oh, I fell over.
- Oh, I fell over again.
- Get off me.
Mr. Powers!
I will never have sex With you, ever.
If you were the last man on Earth...
...and I was the last Woman on Earth, and the future of the human race...
...depended on our having sex simply for procreation...
...I still would not have sex With you.
What's your point, Vanessa?
Yeah.
Remember when We froze your semen?
You said if it didn't look like you were coming back...
...we should try to make you a son...
...so that a part of you could live forever?
- Oh, sure.
Well, after a couple of years, we got a little impatient.
Dr. Evil, I Want you to meet your son.
My son?
Scott!
Hello, Scott.
- Hi.
I'm your father, Dr. Evil.
I haven't seen you my whole life.
And noW you come back and just expect a relationship?
Pfft. I hate you.
What?
- Can I have a hug?
No.
- Give me a hug.
No way.
- Come here.
I'm not.
- Let's go.
Forget it.
Pronto.
- What are you doing?
I'm with it. I'm hip.
Well, don't look at me like I'm fricking
Frankenstein. Give your father a hug.
- You're... Hey. Don't touch me.
- Come on. Hug. Hug.
- Get away from me, you lazy-eyed psycho.
- Hug.
Viva Las Vegas, baby! Yeah!
- Yeah.
Welcome to Las Vegas, sir.
- So which side of the bed do you Want?
- You're sleeping on the sofa, Mr. Powers.
In fact, I'd like to take this opportunity...
...to remind you the only reason We're sharing a room...
...is to keep up the context that we're a married couple on vacation.
Right. Shall we shag now or shall we shag later?
How do you like to do it?
Do you like to wash up first?
You know, top and tails? Whore's bath.
Personally, before I'm on the job...
...I like to give my undercarriage a bit of a hoW's your father.
I'm just joking, Vanessa.
I'm just trying to get a rise out of you, that's all. For shits and giggles.
Let's unpack.
Gor blimey. Nerd alert.
How did this get in here?
Somebody's playing a prank on me.
Honestly, it's not mine.
Hey, Americans. Yeah. Enjoy that wine.
Hey, there you are.
- Do I know you?
- No. But that's Where you are, you're there.
Hey, viva Las Vegas, baby.
Hey, how are you?
- Okay, Austin?
- Yes.
Austin. There's a company in Las Vegas called Virtucon...
...which we think may be linked to Dr. Evil.
Plenty of the Virtucon executives are gambling in this casino.
Smashing. Let's go.
Look. There's one over there.
Changing a thousand.
Hello. Excuse me.
- Do you mind if I join you?
- Not at all.
Game is blackjack, gentlemen.
Ten thousand dollars minimum bet.
King for you, sir. And a three for you.
Seventeen.
- Hit me.
- You have 17, sir.
I like to live dangerously.
Four. Twenty-one.
Nice. Nice.
Nice.
Well-played.
Five.
I'll stay.
I suggest you hit, sir.
- I also like to live dangerously.
As you Wish, sir.
Twenty beats your five. I'm sorry, sir.
Well, I won't lie to you.
Cards are not my bag, baby.
Allow myself to introduce... myself.
My name is Richie Cunningham.
And this is my wife, Oprah.
My name is Number Two.
This is my Italian confidential secretary.
Her name is Alotta. Alotta Fagina.
- Come again?
- Alotta Fagina.
I'm sorry, I'm just not getting it. It sounded like you said your name was a lot of...
Never mind.
- What exactly do you do, Mr. Number Two?
- That's my business.
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have to go to the little boys' room.
You keep your eye on the Italian bird.
- We'll rendezvous back at the hotel suite.
- Okay.
Anything else?
No.
You didn't happen to see anything at all?
Sorry.
Howdy.
That is one crazy getup you got there, fella.
Oh, thank you.
- Are you in the show?
- Uh, no, actually. I'm English.
- Ooh. I'm sorry.
- Right.
- Hey, partner. Have a good one.
- Ah. Okay.
Hey, partner. Come on, you gotta relax. Don't force it.
Gonna blow out your O-ring, drop a lung.
Who does Number Two work for?
That's right, buddy.
You show that turd who's boss.
Hey. Hey, just grab a hold of something, bite your lip and give it hell.
Come on, we're gonna get through this.
Hey, that sounds pretty nasty.
How about a courtesy flush over there?
Jesus Christ, boy. What did you eat?
Gentlemen, the warhead is ours.
Patch me through to the United Nations
Security Secret Meeting Room.
Gentlemen, my name is Dr. Evil.
In a little while, you'll notice that the
Kreplachistani warhead has gone missing.
If you want it back, you're going to have to pay me...
...$1 million.
Sorry.
One hundred billion dollars.
Gentlemen, silence.
- Now, Mr. Evil...
- Dr. Evil.
I didn't spend six years in evil medical school...
...to be called mister, thank you very much.
It is the policy of the United Nations not to negotiate with terrorists.
Really? So long.
Gentlemen, in exactly five days...
...we will be $100 billion richer.
Hello? Mummy?
- Oh, hello, Vanessa. And how's Austin?
- He's asleep.
- You didn't.
- No. I made him sleep on the sofa.
- Vanessa, I'm proud of you.
- Why?
Because you've managed to resist
Austin Powers' charms.
Ha, ha. God knows he tried, Mummy.
I actually had to end up being rather firm with him.
What about his teeth? It's really bizarre.
Darling, you have to understand, in Britain in the '60s...
...you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.
Did you ever...?
Me? No, of course not.
I was married to your father.
- Did you ever Want to?
- Austin is very charming, very debonair.
He's handsome, witty, has a knowledge of fine wines.
Women want him and men want to be him.
Every bit an international man of mystery.
Yeah, you didn't answer my question,
Mummy.
I know.
Let me just say this.
Austin was the most loyal and caring friend I ever had.
I will always love him.
- Do you Wanna speak to him?
- No, it's been too long.
Okay, well, I'm gonna have to go, Mummy.
But I love you.
Ciao, darling.
A limo's just pulled up.
- Let me see.
That's Dr. Evil's cat.
HoW can you tell?
- I never forget a pussy... cat.
Oh, no. He's gone away.
My God, Vanessa.
You are so incredibly beautiful.
- Oh.
- That's it.
Yes. Yes. Yes.
Come on, darling.
I'm gonna take you out for a night on the town.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Burt Bacharach.
Oh, yeah.
Get on with it.
I'm gonna do it. Do you want me?
Unh! Oh, go on.
- Do you Want me to do it? Okay.
- Yes, go on.
Right hand, green. Oh, no!
You all right? You all right?
Oh, you know what?
Wait a tick, I forgot something in the lobby.
Why don't I take the stairs?
Why take the stairs when I could take the escalator?
Why take the escalator when I've got a perfectly good canoe?
I know What. I'll take the elevator.
- Austin.
- Yes.
- Come and have some champagne With me.
- Okay.
Oh, I tripped.
You know, I haven't had this much fun since college.
Well, I'm sorry.
- Why?
- I'm sorry that bug up your ass had to die.
Always wanting to have fun, Austin.
That's you in a nutshell.
No, this is me in a nutshell.
Help. I'm in a nutshell.
How did I get into this nutshell?
Look at the size of this bloody, great, big nutshell.
What sort of shell has a nut like this?
I mean, this is crazy.
Yes. Look at you.
- You're smashed.
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not. I'm the sensible one.
I'm always the designated driver.
- Kiss me.
- I can't, darling.
- Why not?
- Because you're drunk. It's not right.
No, I'm not drunk. I'm beginning to see...
...what my mummy was talking about all those years ago.
I can't.
All right, well, tell me all about my mummy in the '60s.
I'm dying to know what she was like.
She was very groovy.
Your dad loved her very much.
If there Was one other cat in this world that could've loved her...
...and treated her as well as your dad, well, it was me.
But unfortunately for yours truly...
...that train has sailed.
Vanessa? Vanessa? Hello?
Come on. Roll over. Sleepy time.
Okay, Austin needs his hand back.
You've got mail.
Hello, Austin, this is Basil Exposition from British Intelligence.
Now, I want you to find out what part Virtucon plays...
...in something called Project Vulcan.
I'll need you to go to Alotta Fagina's penthouse immediately.
Hello, hello.
Smashing. Love it. Okay. Yes, yes.
Okay, great.
Project Vulcan.
Yeah, okay. Cheeky, huh? Yeah.
Come on, baby. Give it to me.
Yes. Yes. Yes. No! No!
You seem surprised to see me,
Miss Fagina.
What do you want,
Mr. Cunningham' was it?
Your boss, Number Two.
I understand that cat's involved in big underground drills.
How did you know?
I didn't, baby. You just told me.
We can talk about business later.
Let me slip into something more comfortable.
Oh, behave.
Good God.
Me?
Come in and I'll show you everything you need to know.
Come on.
- May I wash you?
- Oh, groovy, baby. Yeah.
Mm, yes. That feels yummy.
In Japan, men come first and women come second.
Or sometimes not at all.
- Care for some sake?
- Sake it to me, baby.
Yes. Kinky. Clinky.
How do you feel, Mr. Cunningham?
Mm. I feel extreme relaxation.
How dare you break wind before me.
I'm sorry, baby.
I didn't know it was your turn.
Pardon me for being rude
It was not me, it was my food
It just popped up to say hello
And now it's gone back down below
That's beautiful. Thank you.
Let's make love, you silly, hairy little man.
I say. Hello, vicar.
Oh, there. That's the spot, all right.
That's the spot right there.
Look at that now. Ha, ha. Good God.
Austin Powers is getting too close.
Any suggestions?
I have created the ultimate weapon to defeat Austin Powers.
Bring in the Fembots!
Go, Fembots!
These are the latest word in android-replicant technology.
Lethal, efficient, brutal.
No man can resist their charm.
Send in the guards!
Kill these women.
Ouite impressive.
- Thank you, Herr Doctor.
I like to see girls of that "caliber."
By caliber, of course I mean both the size of their gun barrels...
...and the high quality of their characters.
Two meanings, caliber. It's a homonym.
Forget it.
At ease, boys.
Austin, I Want to show you something.
We're going to outfit you With this.
It looks like a watch, but in fact it's a geosynchronous positioning device.
Very shagadelic.
- And then there's this.
- Okay, let me guess.
The floss is garrote Wire, the toothpaste is plastic explosives...
...and the toothbrush is the detonation device.
No, actually.
Since you've been frozen, there have been fabulous advances in the field of dentistry.
What do you mean?
Nothing.
Oh, look, here's Basil.
- Hello, Exposition.
- Austin.
Let me bring you up to speed.
Dr. Evil has hijacked a nuclear warhead from Kreplachistan.
Only two things scare me...
...and one is nuclear war.
- What's the other?
- Excuse me?
What's the other thing that scares you?
- Carnies.
- What?
Circus folk. Nomads, you know.
They smell like cabbage.
Small hands.
- Oh. Indeed.
- Perhaps these photographs...
...are the last piece of the puzzle.
I've uncovered the details of Project Vulcan.
Oh, good God, an underground missile?
Austin, where did you find these?
Austin did some reconnaissance work last night at Alotta Fagina's penthouse.
- Our next move is to infiltrate Virtucon.
- What?
Any ideas?
Oh, yes.
Virtucon runs a tour of its facility every hour.
I thought perhaps we could disguise ourselves as tourists...
...and do some on-site reconnaissance.
Top-drawer, Kensington.
Oh, uh, Austin, I'd like you to meet somebody.
This is my mother, Mrs. Exposition.
How do you do?
My God, man, what have you done?
That's not your mother, it's a man, baby!
- Yeah, yeah, come off.
- No!
- Why won't this wig come off?
- My head!
Help!
Austin!
- Yeah, hold on, hold on, one second.
- No, no, let go of my mother!
Oh, mother. Mother, are you all right?
- What?
- Austin, have you gone mad?
No.
You have a lot of explaining to do.
I'm sorry, Basil,
I thought she was a man.
Damn it, man!
You're talking about my mother!
- You have to admit, she is rather mannish.
- Austin.
Well, no offense, but if that is a woman...
...it does look like she was beaten with an ugly stick.
What?
- Really, Austin.
Okay, give in to the beauty of your feelings and say the Words. Come on.
I love you, Dad.
I love you too son.
That's a breakthrough. Breakthrough.
Okay, group, we have some newcomers here today with us.
Say hello to Scott and his father, Mr...
- "Avil"?
- Evil, actually.
Dr. Evil.
Hello, Dr. Evil. Hello, Scott.
Hello, everybody.
So, Scott, why don't we start with you.
What brings you here With us today?
Well, I just really met my Dad for the first time five days ago.
I was partially frozen his whole life.
That is beautiful that you can admit to that.
He comes back and now he Wants me to take over the family business.
But Scott, who's gonna take over the world when I die?
Listen to the words he used: "Who's going to take over the world when I die?"
It feels like that to some of us sometimes, doesn't it?
So, What do you Want to do, Scott?
I don't knoW.
I was thinking I like animals...
...maybe I'd be a vet.
- An evil vet?
No. Maybe, like, Work in a petting zoo.
An evil petting zoo?
- You alWays do that!
- Wha...? I...
I just think, like, he hates me.
I really think he wants to kill me.
Now, Scott, we don't want to kill each other in here...
...we might say that we do sometimes, but we really don't.
Actually, the boy's quite astute.
I really am trying to kill him.
But so far unsuccessfully.
He's quite wily, like his old man.
This is what I'm talking about.
Okay, well...
...we've heard from you, Scott...
...now, uh, you tell us a little about yourself.
The details of my life are quite inconsequential.
Oh, no, please, please.
Let's hear about your childhood.
Yeah.
Come on. Come on.
- Come on. Come on.
Please.
Very well, where do I begin?
My father was a relentlessly self-improving boulangerie owner...
...from Belgium With low-grade narcolepsy and a penchant for buggery.
My mother was a 15-year-old
French prostitute...
...named Chloe with webbed feet.
My father would womanize, he would drink...
...he would make outrageous claims, like he invented the question mark.
Sometimes he would accuse chestnuts of being lazy.
The sort of general malaise that only the genius possess...
...and the insane lament.
My childhood was typical.
Summers in Rangoon, luge lessons.
In the spring we'd make meat helmets.
When I was insolent, I Was placed in a burlap bag and beaten with reeds.
Pretty standard, really.
At the age of 12
I received my first scribe.
At the age of 14, a Zoroastrian named Vilma...
...ritualistically shaved my testicles.
There really is nothing like a shorn scrotum.
It's breathtaking, I suggest you try it.
You know, we have to stop.
Can I have a word with you?
Of course you may, love.
Look, I know I'm being neurotic...
...but I can't shake off this suspicious feeling about that Italian secretary...
...you know, Ms. Fagina.
I don't want to sound paranoid...
...but I've had some bad relationships in the past...
...and I have been known to be jealous.
I'm sorry.
No, don't be sorry, baby.
You're right to be suspicious.
- I shagged her.
- What?
I shagged her rotten, baby, yeah.
I don't believe you, Austin.
I mean, she was repellent.
Saucer of milk, table two.
Rwar.
- Well, did you use protection?
- Of course.
I had my 9 mm automatic.
You know I meant did you use a condom?
No.
Only sailors use condoms, baby.
Not in the '90s, Austin.
Well, they should, those filthy beggars, they go from port to port.
Well, Vanessa, don't have a thrombo.
- Alotta meant nothing to me.
- Well, it means something to me.
If you want us to have a relationship...
...you have to get it into your head that times have changed.
You can't just go off shagging anybody anymore.
And if you could,
I wouldn't because I'm not like that.
Vanessa.
You're everything to me.
You just don't get it, do you?
Good night, Austin.
Welcome to the '90s...
...you're gonna be very lonely.
Hey. Hey, check this guy out.
- Peace.
- Peace. Peace.
Jimi Hendrix, deceased.
Drugs.
Janis Joplin...
...deceased, alcohol.
Mama Cass, deceased...
...ham sandwich.
Oh, jeez, that's great.
Is the lighting halfway decent?
Yes, indeed. They've got the flag up now.? Ou can see the stars and stripes.
Beautiful, just beautiful.
Good morning, Austin.
You know, I sometimes forget you've missed out on the last 30 years.
The fall of the Berlin Wall...
...the first female British prime minister...
...end of apartheid.
Yeah, and I can't believe
Liberace was gay.
I mean, Women loved him.
I didn't see that one coming, no.
The tour is about to begin.
So if you please take your seats.
Welcome to Virtucon, the company of the future.
Virtucon is a leading manufacturer of many items...
...you can find right in your very own home.
Do you think she's prettier than me?
- Who?
- You know who.
Oh, the Italian bird.
No, baby, she's rancid.
I think you're shagadelic, baby.
You're switched-on. You're smashing.
We make steel, petroleum products and volatile chemicals.
But don't worry about the Italian bird, okay?
She's the village bicycle, everyone's had a ride.
You're using a Virtucon product.
On your right, you'll notice a door leading to a restricted area.
- Only authorized personnel are alloWed.
I'll take him.
You take her.
Let's go.
It's Bolton. We've got a problem.
Intruders in the compound.
Aah! Watch out!
Security, this way. Where did he go?
Judo chop.
They're coming.
Hang on, I'm gonna floor it.
Watch out. Move! Move! Move!
Careful, Austin.
No!
- Watch out.
No!
- Watch out.
- No!
Let's go. Come on, let's go.
Oh, thank goodness we made it, Austin.
- All right, stay very cool, baby.
- Okay.
Mr. Powers.
Welcome to my underground lair.
You're just in time.
Enjoy the show.
Gentlemen, I give you the Vulcan.
The world's most powerful subterranean drill.
- Does that make you horny?
- Not now, Austin.
So powerful it can penetrate the Earth's crust...
...delivering a 50 kiloton nuclear warhead...
...deep into the liquid hot core of the planet.
Upon detonation, every volcano on Earth...
...will erupt.
It seems we have no choice but to pay your ransom.
You have my instructions. Bye-bye.
Check it out, Butt-Head, this chick has three boobs.
How many butts does she have?
Do you like your quasi-futuristic clothes, Mr. PoWers?
I designed them myself.
Scott. Scott, my boy, how are you?
How Was your day?
Well, my friend Sweet Jay took me to that video arcade...
...and they don't speak English, so Jay got into a fight...
...and he's all, "Quit hassling me because I don't speak French."
And the guy says something in Paris talk and I'm like, "Just back off."
And they're all, "Get out."
And we're like, "Make me."
It was cool.
Fascinating.
What are your plans for this evening?
I thought I'd stay in. There's a good titty movie on Skinemax.
And that's how you'd like to live your life, is it?
Yeah.
- Pretty much. Yeah, okay.
What?
Scott...
...I Want you to meet Daddy's nemesis,
Austin Powers.
What are you feeding him?
Why don't you just kill him?
No, Scott. I have an even better idea.
I'm going to place him in an easily-escapable situation...
...involving an overly-elaborate and exotic death.
Why don't you just shoot him now?
I mean, I'll go get a gun.
We'll shoot him together. It'll be fun:
Bang! Dead. Done.
One more peep out of you and you are grounded, mister, and I am not joking.
All right, let's begin.
Dr. Evil, do you really expect them to pay?
No, Mr. Powers...
...I expect them to die.
Even after they pay me the money...
...I'm still gonna melt every city on the planet with liquid-hot magma.
Release the sharks.
Mr. Powers, you'll notice that all the sharks...
...have laser beams attached to their heads.
I figure every creature deserves a Warm meal.
Dr. Evil...
...it's about the sharks.
When you were frozen, they were put on the endangered species list.
We tried to get some, but it would have taken months to clear up the red tape.
You know, I have one simple request.
And that is to have sharks with fricking laser beams attached to their heads.
Now, evidently, my cycloptic colleague informs me that that can't be done.
Uh, can you remind me what I pay you people for?
Honestly, throw me a bone here.
What do we have?
Sea bass.
Right.
They are mutated sea bass.
Really?
Are they ill-tempered?
- Absolutely.
- Well, that's a start. That's something.
All right, guard, begin the unnecessarily slow-moving dipping mechanism.
Close the tank!
Wait, aren't you even gonna watch them?
They could get away.
No, no, no,
I'm going to leave them alone...
...and not actually witness them dying.
I'm just gonna assume it all went to plan. What?
I have a gun in my room.
You give me five seconds, I'll get it...
...I'll come back down here, boom, I'll blow their brains out.
Scott...
...you just don't get it, do you?
You don't.
It's no hassle.
But... I'm...
All I'm saying...
They're gonna get aw... I...
I'm... We...
- We...
- Shh. Knock, knock?
Who's there?
- Look...
- Shh! Let me tell you a story...
...about a man named Shh.
Shh! Even before you start.
That was a preemptive "shh."
Just know I have a whole bag of "shh" with your name on it.
What's your plan?
First, I plan to soil myself.
Then I'm going to regroup and come up with a new plan.
Any thoughts?
Wait a minute.
I always have this with me just in case.
Okay, I get it. I have bad teeth.
No, Austin. The floss is to swing ourselves onto the ledge.
All right, hold on.
Got it. Okay. Toothpaste.
Hello.
Judo chop!
Hang on.
Judo trip.
No!
Not a good time to lose one's head.
Indeed.
That's not the way to get ahead in life.
No.
It's a shame he wasn't more headstrong.
He'll never be the head of a major corporation.
- Okay, that'll do.
- Okay.
No. What are we gonna do?
Oh, look, there's an emergency exit.
Go get help, I'm gonna stay here...
...and keep an eye on Dr. Evil.
Okay, I'll hurry back.
Listen, Vanessa.
Whatever happens...
...I Want you to know that I feel really bad...
...about that Italian bird.
What I'm trying to say is...
...that if you want me to be a one-woman man...
...well, that's just groovy, baby.
Behave.
Come, everyone...
...let us repair to the main chamber.
Project Vulcan is about to begin.
Scott, don't you want to see what Daddy does for a living?
- BloW me.
- Excuse me?
Show me.
Okay.
Position the Vulcan.
Bring in the warhead.
Hello, hello.
- Hello, Mr. Powers.
- Hello, Mr. Powers.
- Care to have a little fun?
- Care to have a little fun?
No, actually, I, uh...
I have to save the World.
Is it cold in here? Heh.
Arm the probe.
Yes.
No! No. No. I've got to get Dr. Evil.
I've got to get Dr. Evil.
No. No. No. Uh, baseball.
Uh, cold showers.
Baseball. Cold showers...
Give it up, Mr. Powers.
Margaret Thatcher naked on a cold day!
Gentlemen.
Let's lock and load.
Right, lads.
All right, hup, hup.
- Don't go.
- Please don't go.
Stay.
Don't go.
You can't resist us, Mr. Powers.
You can't resist us, Mr. Powers.
Au contraire, baby.
I think you can't resist me.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
Austin?
Vanessa.
It... It's not what it seems.
- At ease, boys.
- Likewise.
Vanessa, I can explain. See, What happened was, uh, I broke in trying to get to Dr. Evil.
Then the Fembots came by and smoke started to come out of their jubblies.
So I thought I'd work my mojo, right, to counter their mojo.
We got "cross-mojonations" and their heads started to explode. You know...
...that thing and I ended up in my knickers here and then...
Okay, Austin, I believe you.
- Now, get dressed.
- Smashing, baby.
OnWard, boys.
Launching the subterranean probe.
Begin initial surface penetration.
Subterranean nuclear detonation in three minutes and counting.
Watch out!
Fight back!
Subterranean nuclear detonation...
...in three minutes and counting.
I tripped.
Open the fricking door.
World destruction, beginning in...
Judo. Judo.
10, nine...
...eight, seven, six...
...five, four, three...
...tWo, one...
No!
Abort. Abort.
- Abort. Abort.
Hurray!
Abort. Abort.
Now to Dr. Evil.
Din-din.
I want chicken
I want liver
Meow Mix, Meow Mix
Please deliVer
I've got you now, Dr. Evil.
Well done, Mr. PoWers.
We're not so different, you and I.
However, isn't it ironic that the very things that you stand for...
...free love, swinging' parties, are all now in the '90s...
...considered to be...
...evil?
No, man, what We swingers were rebelling against...
...is uptight squares like you...
...whose bag was money and world domination.
We were innocent, man.
If we had known the consequences of our sexual liberation...
...we would have done things differently, but the spirit would've remained the same.
It's freedom, baby, yeah.
Face it. Freedom failed.
No, man, freedom didn't fail.
Right now, We've got freedom and responsibility.
It's a very groovy time.
There's nothing more pathetic than an aging hipster.
All right, baldy, shut your cakehole.
Come on, let's go, on your bike.
Not so fast.
It seems the tables have turned,
Mr. Powers.
- Go ahead, Austin. Don't worry about me.
- Hey, I can take my Sega, right, Dad?
It seems the tables have turned again,
Dr. Evil.
Not really. Kill the little bastard, see what I care.
But Dad, we just had a breakthrough in group.
I had the group liquidated, you little shit.
They were insolent.
I hate you. I hate you.
I wish I was never artificially created in a lab.
Oh, Scott, that hurts Daddy when you say that, honestly.
Number TWo, your timing is impeccable.
Go ahead, take Mr. Powers away.
No.
- What?
Dr. Evil...
...I spent 30 years of my life turning this two-bit evil empire...
...into a world-class multinational.
I was going to have a cover story in Forbes.
But you, like an idiot, wanted to take over the world.
And you don't realize there is no World anymore.
It's only corporations.
- Silence, Number Two.
- No.
I've had enough of you pushing me around.
Mr. Powers, I have a business proposition you might find very interesting.
All right, I've had enough.
Judo chop.
The complex will self-destruct.
Let's split. Let's go.
This place is gonna blow.
The complex will self-destruct.
Go!
Come on, let's go.
The complex will self-destruct.
This Way, Austin.
Come on, baby...
...it's gonna bloW, let's go.
Move it. Alley-oop.
Yeah.
I love you, Mr. Powers.
And I love you, Mrs. Powers.
Oh, that'll be Basil Exposition.
- Oh, ignore it, Austin. Come back to bed.
- Duty calls, baby.
Hello, Austin.
Oh, I... I hope I'm not interrupting your honeymoon.
No, not at all, Basil.
Did you get that fruit basket I sent you?
Yes, we did, Basil, but you sent too much.
I'm gonna have to send some to my mother.
- Oh, don't forget these.
- Oh, thanks.
- There you go.
- Did you get my other gift?
- We did.
- Yes, Basil, nice rack.
But Who in the world gave us this drawing?
It's bizarre.
Well, as you know,
Dr. Evil has escaped in his rocket...
...which has disappeared from our tracking system.
- Oh, dear. Hold on. Coffee?
- Oh, yes, please.
Okay. Thank you.
Oh, and Vanessa, by the way, you have been made a full agent.
Oh, that's fantastic, Basil. Thanks.
- Milk?
- Yes, please.
Oh, and Austin, her Majesty, the Queen, informs me that you are to be knighted.
Very shagadelic.
Well, the best of luck to both of you.
- Thanks, Basil.
- Goodbye.
You know, Vanessa,
I'll never forget the first time I saW you.
You were so incredibly beautiful.
So incredibly sexy.
I knew I had to have you...
...right then and there.
Did you feel the same way?
Actually, I couldn't stop staring at your teeth.
Oh, I ordered some champagne. Come in.
Oh, lovely, Austin.
Right over there's fine, thank you.
Let's go out on the terrace.
It's a beautiful night, we can look at the stars.
Smashing idea, baby.
Yeah, look at you.
Oh! Look out!
That really hurt.
I'm gonna have a lump there, you idiot.
Who throws a shoe? Honestly.
You fight like a woman.
Austin.
Honestly, it's not mine.
No, use it.
Look how beautiful the night sky is.
Hey, isn't that the Big Dipper?
Yeah, and that looks just like Uranus.
- Austin.
- Well, you know.
- Hey, I've never seen that big star before.
- Yeah, what is that?
Good God.
I'm gonna get you, Austin PoWers.
It's fricking freezing in here,
Mr. Bigglesworth.
Darling, you look fabulous.
Okay, baby, here we go.
All right, there We go. Look at that face.
Show me again, come on.
Bit of hair, bit of hair, bit of hair.
Smashing. Okay. It's coming around noW.
Coming around. Yes.
Yes, great. Yes, yes, yes.
No! No! No. No, it's not working.
Darling, you go change, there you go.
Can you change her? Is that okay? All right?
Very good. Very good.
And right here.
Right here, looking right there.
Looking right... I'm not even looking.
Oh, you're wicked. You got your mojo working overtime, darling. Yeah.
Look, I'm not even shooting you, it's insane.
Smashing. Beautiful.
Come on, can I get a smile?
Okay, come on. Come on, you boys, get together, come on.
Okay, good. Loving it.
Let's make a Vanessa sandwich.
You're wearing horns, you're wearing horns.
Come on, Austin, give it to me. Go. Go...
Oh, behave.
Okay, you're an animal. An animal. Yes.
Yes, that's it. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Just the top of the hair, that's all I want.
Born, and shoot.
Again, try it one more time.
And I'm born, and shoot. That's it, yeah.
Let's go, come on, come on. Come on.
Ignore this. Ignore this.
Ignore me doing this.
Fabulous, darling.
Go, go, go!
Lord. Lord.
Yes, yes, yes. Okay, shoW me eyes.
Yes. Yes. Yes...
No! No! No! Never get... And I'm spent.
What say you we go out on the town and swing, baby, yeah.
[Man] All right, people, let's go!
Let's go!
[Man #2] Let's go, everybody!
We need your help here!
Come up here! Get in here, get in here!
She's close!
Vitals are down to nothing.
Here you go. Come on.
Let me get in here. You got her?
- We're clear. We're clear.
- I got it.
- All right, lift her up on three.
One, two, three. Up.
- Who's hanging blood?
- Can you hear me? Can you hear me?
- Get in there.
Get her prepped. Let's move!
Let's go! Let's go!
We need some room!
Spread it out, spread it out!
Let's make a hole! Come on!
- Get a sterile pack!
- Right down the hallway, please!
- Let's go! In here!

- We tried everything.
The trauma was just too much.
- [Sniffles, Sighs]
[Sighs] The baby?
The baby, I'm concerned, might have some abnormalities.
Outwardly, we can already tell that the child has no pigmentation.
It's called albinism.
It's strictly genetic.
That's, that's--
Well, that's pale skin, right?
And pale eyes that are usually more light sensitive.
- I want to see him.
- Greg, you have to remember that an unborn child... experiences everything that the mother experiences.
You take me to him.
You show me.

- [Woman] Doug.
Thanks for making the drive.
- Are we still in Wheaton County?
- Barely.
- Did I ruin your Sunday?
- Well, I guess if somebody... was going to have to,
I'm glad it was you.
[Screen Door Squeaks Open]
Doug...
I can hear him again.
- He's movin' around down there.
- Tell me you didn't try to talk to him.
- You bet your ass I didn't.
- Good.
Miss Caldwell.
They said a boy, right?
I'm guessing that's what it is.
The old man here died last night.
The neighbors found him this morning.
- We figure the kid's his grandson.
- So where is he?
He won't come up from the cellar.
He didn't report his grandfather's death either.
We already know he died of natural causes.
Doug, what am I doing here?
The neighbors say he may be retarded.
One of them says deformed.
You know, physically handicapped.
I don't know.
I couldn't for the life of me think of who else to call.
He's scared enough, and I thought maybe you could... come down and talk him out of there without us having to go down and drag him out.
Jessie... the neighbors talk about him like he's some kind of a phantom.
I haven't met one yet that ever had a good look at him.
What are you telling me, Doug?
That the old folks may have kept him down there... like some kind of a family secret.
I don't know.
Boy?
I brought somebody to talk to you.
[Grunting]
Hello?
Hey, my name is Jessie.
Are you okay down here?
You think we could turn a light on?
Hey, if you're afraid, you don't need to be. Not with me.
[Boy, Softly]
I'm not afraid.
What's your name?
Powder.
- Is that a name or a nickname?
- He was getting coffee and he fell.
He jus--
He just fell over and died.
I tried to help him.
- I tried. He--
- [Doug] We know that.
Son, I told you, you're not in any trouble.
- I'm sorry. I just want to see you.
- Why?
Well, come on. Nobody's gonna hurt you.
It's all right.
Give me your hand.
Come on.
What's your real name, son?
Jeremy Reed.
You've been down here all night, Jeremy.
[Jessie] You must be starved.
Could you get us something to eat?
Anything. Sheriff?
We'll be all right.
Be right back.
[Footsteps Ascending Stairs]
Why didn't you tell anyone when you knew he was dead?
Why didn't you call the police?
Grandpa said there would be a day... when he would die... like Grandma died.
And that people would come... and see me... and try and take me away.
[Radio Transmission,
Onlookers Chattering]
- Get back there.
Keep an ear, but don't go down.
- Yes, sir.
Lucy, this is Barnum.
[Radio] Go ahead, Sheriff. I'm here.
We're still out at the Reeds'.
We got something out here nobody's gonna believe.
- You don't live down here?
- Mmm.
I do most of the work around the place... [Sniffs] at least until the sun gets too high.
Then the sunglasses don't even help.
Did you know they make contact lenses now... that can protect your eyes from the sun all the time?
I read about them, but Grandpa said they cost too much. [Sniffs]
When's the last time you were in school?
I've never been to school.
I read about it though.
But you said you read all these books?
And... have you read this book?
Well, I know college kids who couldn't wade through this one.
Pick a page.
Two hundred and sixteen.
"Where lies the final harbor, whence we unmoor no more.
"In what rapt ether sails the world of which the weariest will never weary?
"Where is the foundling's father hidden?
"Our souls are like those orphans whose unwedded mothers die in bearing them.
"And the secret of our paternity lies in their grave, and we must there learn it. "
You know the whole book?
I know 'em all.
- Go clear 'em back.
- All right, everybody, let's move back.
- And I mean back beyond the vehicles.
Let's go!
- [Onlooker] Okay.
[Hinges Squeak]
[Birds Chirping]
It's all right.
You don't have to be afraid.
You're afraid.
You're afraid for me.

[Deputy] You ever see so many goddamn lightning rods on one house?
I just got off the horn with the coroner.
He said that old boy died of natural causes, but there was evidence of fibrillation.
His body was juiced with electricity.
That old man was laying dead there all night.
You think the paramedics showed up this morning and tried paddles on him?
Are you telling me the kid electrocuted the old man?
What do you think, he's Dr. Frankenstein?
I'm just sayin' that that's more than an albino, Doug.
That is spooky.
I never thought we'd find a man too white for you there, Harley.

They spend most their time tryin' to look tough.
You get to know 'em, you find out they're... mostly scared and lonely just like everybody else.

- [Boys, Hushed] Oh, man.
- Whoa.
What the hell is that?
You need to see him, Aaron, to know what I'm saying.
You need to see him sitting out in the hall right now...
'cause, I'm telling you,
I've never seen anything like him.
That's exactly what I mean.
Because of the way he's lived.
Uh, he doesn't seem to know what things are.
I think things you and I take for granted-- common, everyday objects, simple ideas--
I just don't think he's ever been exposed to them.
I mean, he's about the most well-read teenage kid you could ever meet.
But in other ways...
[Whispers] I think he's a lot like a little child.

Did you hear what I said?
I don't like your eyes.
[Laughing, Murmuring]
What's a new guy gotta do the first day he gets here?
He's gotta do the due.
New guy, first day, first meal.
He's gotta wear his spoon.
[Laughing, Murmuring]
You ever wear your spoon?
Well, you got two choices.
You can either wear it on the end of your nose--
Why don't you show, Mitch.
[Exhales]
[Laughing]
[Snickers]

Now, you can wear it like that... or you can wear it the other way, which is up your ass.

Did her more good than them painkillers.
She was hurtin' all day
'til he got here.
[Sighs]
He brought her that too.
- What happened out at the Reed farm today?
- I'm here, angel.
Something about a retarded boy they got up at the state home now.
How the hell did you hear about that?
I guess I don't have to tell you what I think about that.
- I'd love it if you didn't.
- The last thing we need up there... is another mental defective along with all that other trash.
[Softly] Here you go.
[Chews Ice]
I don't know what he is, but retarded he's not.
Well, aside from the absence of any and all body hair, which is a condition not too uniquely uncommon, bottom line, he's a very healthy young man.
In fact, with all that farm work,
I'd say you're in damn fine shape.
And the optometrist said his contact lenses'll be here...
- the end of the week?
- [Doctor] They'll be callin' him
"Ol' Blue Eyes"... in time for the county fair.
- You guys are comin', right?
- Uh, you'll see a few of us there.
Hey, Doc, thanks for comin' out.
It's my pleasure.
Good day, Mr. Jeremy Reed.
Jeremy, listen, uh,
I want you to think about something.
We attend school in town at Wheaton High.
You certainly wouldn't be at an intellectual disadvantage there, and I know most of the teachers so--
Anyway, um, all I'm saying is, if you'd like to attend school one day next week, I can arrange it.
Will my contacts be ready by Monday?

[Brakes Squeaking]
[Chattering Continues]
[Chattering Continues]
- Come on, let's go. Okay?
- Hey, there.
- I left it in my locker.
- Hey, what is that?
- I'll go get it.
- Hey, check it out.
Hey, hey, guys.
Check that guy out.
- Look, look.
- [Girl Giggling]
[Chattering Stops]
[Chalk Squeaking]
[Softly] Molecules.
When we speed up the course of molecules, we get...
[Tapping Feet] energy.
And, um, since we are all basically... just a mass of molecules, what does our brain send out to all the other parts of the body?
Lindsey?
Um, impulses.
Yeah.
Electric impulses.
Jeremy, turn your head and look at Lindsey.
[Students Snickering]
Yes. That's lovely.
That's very good.
You've just relayed electricity.
Your brain sent out an electric impulse... down to your neck muscles... and, uh, what, what turned your head, besides the obvious?
What your, what your muscles used to turn your head?
[Snapping Fingers]
It's energy. Energy.
Always relaying, always transforming.
And never ending.
Now looky here.
This is a, uh, a Jacob's ladder.
It's a science fair toy, and it's, uh, built to show us how electricity travels.
Okay?
Can we get the, uh, shutters?
Watch this.
[Teacher Sighs, Students Gasping]
Hey, cut it out.
Cut it out.
[Clicks Switch,
Electricity Buzzing]
[Continues Buzzing]
- [Students Chuckling]
- [Teacher] Ooh, look at this.
Blinding, isn't it? Now, who can tell me why electricity travels?
Uh, boredom?
- [Students Laughing]
- Huh, he tickles me.
No. No, potential.
Potential.
One side of this thing is positive, while the other side... has a strong negative pull.
And, uh, that's all the potential that electricity needs to travel.
- [Buzzing]
- That's right.
That's pretty good. Don't I bring you good, entertaining things?
But you get the idea that it does-- You know, it-it travels and just keeps going.
Did you ever--
What's your experience with electricity?
Did you ever, you know, run your feet over a carpet like that and touch somebody?
- What happens?
- Static electricity?
That's right, that's right. Now, where does it go when y-you touch somebody?
- [Pen Spinning]
- [Teacher] It just goes out.
So ener-- So, so electricity, like energy, uh, just-just, um, uh, recycles.
- [Buzzing Louder]
- It flows in a cycle that d-doesn't end.
- It-It, uh--
- [Buzzing Louder]
[Buzzing Louder]
Are you all right?
Mr. Ripley?
[Arcing Faster, Buzzing Louder]
Are you okay?
[Students Shouting]
[Students Gasping]
[Gasps]
The local news and those Channel 5 people are outside.
So is Jimmy Hobbs from the newspaper.
- Tell them to go home.
- Oh, come on, Doug.
They ain't goin' anywhere 'til somebody goes out there and talks to 'em.
Tell them there's no fatalities, no sex scandal. That will get rid of them fast.
Goddamn it, Doug,
I sound like a moron...
- if I say more than five words to those people, and you know it.
- Well, if the shoe fits--
[P. A. System] Dr. Tarentino, you're wanted in Pediatrics.
[Doctor] But I can't do it. I've got no authorization to do anything.
- I can't let you go anywhere--
- [Doug] Hi, Doc.
Here we go, here we go.
Doug, Doug, tell Duane that it's okay for me to see that kid.
- Thank you.
- Donald, you're just the man
I wanted to see.
I got 20 different kids telling me 20 different stories.
Right. Uh, if I hadn't seen it myself,
I'd say it was impossible.
It was a model. For God sakes, it picked him right out of his seat.
- What did?
- Hold it! Ho-Hold it, Doug.
The kid doesn't have a scratch on him.
Heart rate's a little irregular, but nothing to indicate the kind of electrical shock you're talking about.
Right, right! And he's got a hole, uh, burned in his shirt... the size of a bowling ball.
[Ripley Sighs]
Something's happened here.
Something's happened here.
I'm telling you, with everything we know about science, about the makeup of the human body, what happened in that classroom is impossible!
That kid attracted an arc of electricity from 30 feet away!
And not just from the Jacob's ladder.
I mean, after a second, it was like it was... comin' at him out of the whole... building.
- You want to know why there isn't a hair on him?
- [Doug] Why?
Because he is electrolysis.
It can't grow on him.
- [Nurse] Doc Roth?
- Yes?
- Can I see you for a minute?
- Excuse me.
- [Nurse] Excuse me.
- [P. A. System] Dr. McGrail and Dr. Cain to C. C. U.
- Drink that in.
- Dr. McGrail and Dr. Cain to C. C. U.
[Doug] I will.
Nobody saw him leave his room,
- but his clothes are gone too.
- Find him.
He can't have gotten far.
[P. A. System]
Dr. Brodnick, call 2-9-2.
- Dr. Brodnick, 2-9-2, please.
- Lucy, come in.
[Birds Chirping]
[Dog Barking]
[Barking Continues]
- [Softly] Hey.
- [Growling, Barking]
- [Barking, Growling Continue]
- Zack! Zachary!
Zack, come here.
Come here, boy.
[Barking]
- [Growling]
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Watch out. He bites.
[Whimpering]
The family before us made him pretty mean, so--
Wow, I can't believe I'm looking at you.
Are you okay?
- [Zack Whimpering]
- I didn't mean to scare anybody.
- The whole thing was pretty embarrassing really.
- Embarrassing?
You're kidding, right?
[Giggles]
My grandma used to say
I have an electric personality.
[Laughs]
Well, that was some light show.
I mean, people will be talking about that... to their grandkids' grandkids around here.
I don't mean to stare, but I had a bet with a friend... that you have blue-grey eyes.
She says they're blue-green.
Looks like she's right.
Well, actually, you're... you're both wrong.
Oh.
Sorry.
No, no, that's okay. Just kind of took me by surprise, that's all.
- [Zack Panting]
- [Sighs] Oh, well.
- [Raking]
- [Zack Barks]
- [Continues Raking]
- [Lindsey] You must feel like you've got two heads...
- the way everybody looks at you around here, huh?
- [Raking Continues]
Have you ever listened to people from the inside?
Listened so close, you can hear their thoughts... and all their memories?
Hear 'em think from places that they don't even know they think from?
What are you saying?
You can do that?
Are you sure you're okay?
[Nervous Laugh]
Do you know how to get to the interstate?
Yeah, it's um--
If you follow the train tracks, you'll see the Redmond water tower.
Then, if you go across the trestle, you'll see it.
- But you're really okay?
- [Softly] I'm okay.
You better hurry.
They catch boys running away from Central, I hear they get solitary.
Hey!
Stay away from those electrical outlets, okay?
[Softly] Bye.
[Birds Chirping]
[Chirping Continues]
[Engines Stop]
I didn't know better,
I'd say you were headed for the highway.
Don't make me come out there, boy.
Now, you're about to make me a whole lot meaner. Trust me, son,
- you don't want to make me mad.
- Afraid.
I don't make you mad,
I make you afraid.
What was that?
I said that you're afraid of me.
Duncan, get on back.
I can handle this.
I'm all right.
- I can see that.
- [Jeremy] Then let me go home.
I don't want to go back to that hospital.
We'll call the doc. If he says okay,
I'll take you back to Central.
Central's not my home.
[Doug] I'm trying to tell you as nice as I know how.
Now either you come with me without a fuss or we're gonna have ourselves a problem.
You want me to cuff him?
[Engine Starts]
Lucy, this is One.
We got him.
I'm coming back to the office.
[Transmission Distorts]
... Doug.
You got a problem with hospitals in general?
I don't like 'em.
Well, you can put me on that list.
Worst day I can remember was in a hospital.
[Door Opens, Closes]
What day was that?
The day I was born.
Let me get this straight, Jeremy.
You said that you've never been tested for I. Q. before. Is that right?
And your grandmother tutored you.
Did she ever say anything about it?
She said I was a fast learner.
[Laughs] Yeah.
Well, I think that's about to fall into the "no shit" category.
[Sighs]
Jeremy Reed, this is Dr. Aaron Stipler with the State Board of Education.
- Jeremy.
- [Jessie]
These men and women are here... because the results of your diagnostics came back with a few surprises.
Please, sit down.
[Sighs]
Miss Caldwell says you're a very unique young man, Jeremy.
Hmm.
She also tells me that, um, reading and your grandparents are the only ways you've experienced the world.
Is that true?
What about a radio or, um, a TV set?
- Surely you've watched some television at some point.
- He probably couldn't.
Didn't your grandparents have a TV set, Jeremy?
I could never watch television.
- Are you saying you weren't allowed?
- Here, it probably just makes--
- [Signal Distorting]
- No.
- [Distorted Signal Continues]
- Oh.
I'm saying I could never watch television.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
That was-- That was my fault. l, uh-- I was-- I was just trying to make them understand.
What the good doctor hasn't, uh, let you in on yet is that...
- your test shows that you're a genius.
- [Stipler] Please!
Your I. Q. scored right off the charts, Jeremy.
There isn't even a classification for you, it was so high.
All of your tests indicate that you have the most advanced intellect... in the history of humankind.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
If you thought I was that advanced, would you ask me if I understood?
- [Chuckles]
- [Jessie] Jeremy, these people are in a position to help you.
Can they send me home?
- Can they send me back?
- No.
I'm sorry. They can't.
The fact is, the... the farm's in probate.
Do you know what that means?
Of or pertaining to probate or a court of probate, exempli gratia... the official proving of a will as authentic or genuine.
Or it can also mean the official, certified copy of a will so proved.
Right.
Well, it-it seems that the bank owns most of it.
I'm sorry.
[Clearing Throat]
Well, back to the matter at hand.
I have a few more questions
I have to ask you,
- Jeremy.
- You're not here to ask me questions.
You're here to find out how I cheated.
That's the only way you can make sense of it.
- [Lights Flickering]
- That's what you need to believe.
But I don't need you to believe in me, Dr. Stipler.
- [Lights Flickering]
- And I'm not interested in any of your tests.
I'm not interested in you, or anything else here.
I'm interested in going home!
[Lights Go Out]
- What the hell is going on here?
- What you already know.
I'm not like other people.
[Door Closes]
[Sighs]
[Boys Chattering, Laughing]
[Boys Chattering]
[Continue Chattering]
- Over there.
- Okay, do I got to hang it up too?
- No, no, no.
- [Guitar, Chattering Continue]
Did you see that guy playing in the football game?
- Yeah.
- God!
[Chattering, Laughing Continue]
What the hell is that thing doing up here anyway?
Jessie told me you didn't want to come up here.
I don't want to be anywhere that's not home.
Jessie's trying so hard to help you, kiddo.
If you're as smart as they say you are, you know she's about the best friend you got.
[Thunder Rumbling]
The storm's over Poho County.
We'll be lucky to get a drop.
When a thunderstorm comes up,
I can feel it inside.
And when lightning comes down,
I can feel it wanting to come to me.
Grandma said it was God.
She said the white fire was God.
Do you believe in God, Sheriff?
- [Thunder Rumbling]
- That it was God who took my mother?
[Thunder Claps]
Anna!
[Greg Screaming]
Hey.
Took your mother?
Your grandfolks told you that?
I remember it.
[Footsteps]
[Leaves Rustling]
Hello, John, Mitch.
What the hell are you doing out this far?
What are you?
You're supposed to be at the lake, skinny-dipping with the rest of the faggots.
[Cocks Rifle]
You afraid you're gonna get a little color on that marshmallow ass of yours?
Look, man, you'd better get out of here.
- [Mitch] Oh, Johnny!
- How about it, huh?
What are you doin', man?
I could do you right now.
Right now, man.
One less freak in the freak show.
Come on, man!
It might go off!
Why don't you go suck your old man off some more?
How about it, huh? You gonna show us one of your little tricks?
Come on, John!
It's--
[Gunshot]
[Jubilant Hooting, Shouting]
[Hooting, Shouting Continue]
- Let's go!
- Yeah!
- All right!
- Look at it! Look at it! Look at it!
Oh, man!
[Panting]
A good hunter don't hunt for the kill.
A good hunter hunts for the hunt.
Now, that's a perfect hit right there.
That's a perfect shot. That's a clean kill right through the heart.
Y'all see that?
Now, what she's doing now--
It's just her nerves dyin'.
Suffering's minimal when you know what you're doin'.
What the hell are you doing out here?
Now listen to me.
You didn't see any of this, you hear?
Now you just back out of here, boy.
Now, now, stay away from it.
It ain't dead yet, stupid.
Well, what the hell's with you, man?
Oh, let's get this moron out of here before he gets himself kicked.
[Gasping]
- [Boys] What's he doin'?
- What's he doin'?
What do you think you're doin', man?
- [Gasping]
- Hey, come on!
- Harley?
- Let Harley go!
- [Gasping]
- Oh, my God!
- Cut it out, man!
- Stop, man!
- Somebody do something!
- Say something, man!
- Are you okay?
- Somebody make him stop.
[Mitch] It doesn't matter what you do, just make him stop!
- Somebody make him stop! Come on!
- Come on, man!
- [Gasping]
- Harley! He's giving him a heart attack or something!
- Let him go!
- [Harley Screaming]
- Harley! Harley!
- Do something, John!
- Let him go, you freak!
- Do something, John!
- He's gonna have a heart attack.
- Let him go. Now. Let him go.
- Do it!
- Put the goddamn gun down, John.
- Do it!
- [Harley Gasping]
- [Gun Fires]
- [Harley Screaming, Boys Shouting]
- Harley!
- Harley! Harley, calm down!
- Harley!
- Are you okay? Harley?
[Gasping, Whimpering]
[Crying]
[Whimpering, Sobbing]
[Continues Crying]
[Sobbing]
Break it up, guys.
Come on. Okay.
[Doug] I left camp for less than an hour.
When I get back, one of my deputies is being hauled down the mountain in an ambulance.
The boys tell me that you gave him some sort of an attack.
It was like a seizure.
- Is that right?
- No.
Then what did happen?
Why won't you tell anyone?
I let him see.
I opened him up, and I let him see.
He just couldn't see what he was doing, so I helped him.
[Radio Distorting, Static]
Sheriff--
[Turns Down Radio]
You better start leveling with me.
Go ahead.
[Radio Static Continues]
It's Maxine, Doug. She just called.
I'm on my way.
I gotta go.
I need you to think real hard about telling me what happened.
Thanks, Jess.
- [Door Closes]
- Jeremy, please.
I want to go home.
Do you understand that?
I want to go home.
Look, whatever happened up there, whatever you saw--
I saw that
I don't like what you do!
Any of you!
- Jeremy--
- No!
You pretend to be my friend, the way you pretend everything!
[Glass Cracks]
A friend doesn't lock you up!
- [Glass Shattering]
- [Gasps]
A friend doesn't take you away from your home,
- [Gasps]
- and say that it's for your own good!
[Electrical Buzzing]
How long do you really think
I'll let you keep me here?
[Panting]
[Door Closes]
She's all right.
I got nervous when I couldn't find you, so I called the doc.
[Sighs] Harley just got admitted over at County.
Give a call over there, will you,
Maxine? Find out how he's doing.
Listen, this is like having your heart torn out every day.
Doug, there's no explanation why your wife should still be alive right now.
[Doug] Give me the short one, will you, Doc?
She can't like seeing this strain on you, which may be why she's hanging on through the worst pain of her life.
[Sighs]
It's just gonna make it that much easier if we get her back to County.
This is where she wants to be, Duane.
She told me when she still could.
She keeps holding on.
I just don't know why.
And you won't.
Doug, she's past communicating.
- You can't get inside of her head.
- [Sighs]
And if you could, she'd probably tell you...
"Let me go. "
[Crickets Chirping]
[Ripley Knocking]
Knock, knock.
Mind if I come in?
[Sighs]
Hey, you-you did something to me.
Um... you know,
I-I didn't figure it out... until enough people looked at me like
I was crazy or told me to act my age, but you, uh, uh, zapped me or I, uh, zapped myself when I touched you.
But I've been-- I-I've been running around on this high like I was 18 again.
I've had more ideas and more, more focus... and... better sex than I've had in ten years.
Do you believe me?
Well... why shouldn't you?
You know if what I say is bullshit, don't you?
So you know when I say
I'm just here to talk... that, uh, that I mean it.
Uh, say, did you--
Did you read any, uh, Einstein?
No? Oh, well--
Oh, I think you'd like him.
Um, he said he believed in life after death.
Only because energy can never cease to exist.
That it relays, it transforms, but it doesn't stop ever.
Uh, and he said that if we ever got to the point... where we could use all our brain, uh, that we'd be pure energy... and that we wouldn't even need bodies.
Now, um, wh-what would you say to the possibility... that because something happened to you, uh, something that never does or isn't supposed to, that you are, are closer to that energy level... than any one body has ever been?
I'd say, "So what?"
So what?
Jeremy, y-you know, y-your life up 'til now has been... that farmhouse and, uh, and the 12 acres of earth.
You know, you've kind of lived in books.
But I think you're starting to find out now that the misery... that you read about is real.
The tragedy is, is real in all those stories, Jeremy.
Did you think that it wasn't?
I mean, my God, that deer hunt--
You think that's the dark side of man? Killing for pleasure?
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry, but you haven't begun to see what we do.
We're-- Jesus, we're stumbling around in a very dark age... basically just trying not to kill each other.
So it hurts me when you say, "So what?" because you are not just different, Jeremy.
I think that you have a mind that, uh, that we won't evolve to for like, uh, thousands of years.
You're maybe the man of the future right here and now.
I don't know.
And I'm-I'm not here to hurt you.
Jeremy, I want to be a-a-a friend.
[Sighs]
I want to talk with you.
Well... I mean, did you ever have a friend?
I don't need a friend.
Really?
Gee, I thought you were a genius.
You know what I say is true.
Are you telling me you, like, never shook anybody's hand before?
Ah, how do you do?
Hmm? Now we've been properly introduced.
Want to see a trick?
[Chuckles]
[Laughs]
Hmm.
Wow.
They were afraid to touch me after a while.
My grandma and grandpa, they--
They got really scared.
What? To touch you?
Jeremy, that's not right.
No way.
That's not right.
[Shifts Into Park,
Stops Engine]
[Knocking]
Doug.
You've done a little spring cleaning?
What the hell are you doing here, Doug?
A couple of my deputies told me that Harley Duncan... got rid of every goddamn gun in his house.
Said he dropped out of the marksman tourney over in Butte too.
The one he wins every year.
I just ain't huntin' no more, Doug.
Is that some kind of crime?
I just got lots of other stuff to do.
You gonna stop carrying one on the job?
If you can't pick it up and use it, that's a liability.
I want you to level with me.
I already know you snuck off hunting with the boys, which is the last damn thing you should have done.
Yeah, I know.
I know.
[Sighs]
And I popped this pretty doe, just up at Little Lake.
Let me tell you something, Doug.
You ever tell anybody I said this,
I'm moving out of town.
That... kid?
He lays his hand on the deer while it's still shakin'... and then he touches me at the same time.
Now, I can't figure out why...
'til my heart starts poundin' and I'm shakin', and I'm feelin' myself hurt and scared shitless, slippin' away in the goddamn dark.
That's the worst thing I ever felt.
It's like I could feel that animal dyin'.
[Exhales] It's like I was the goddamn thing.
- Aw, come on, Harley.
- Doug, I swear.
Now... I--
I just can't do it anymore.
I can't look at something down the barrel of a gun without thinking about it.
I've tried it.
I'm telling you, that thing ain't normal.
I'm telling you, he took whatever was in that goddamn deer, and he put it right into me.
[Door Creaking Open]
[Doug] I'm sorry, son.
Uh... Jessie said... it may be okay for you to come with me.
[Crickets Chirping,
Car Approaching]
[Engine Idling]
[Turns Off Engine]
I don't know what it is you do.
I'm not even sure
I believe you can do it.
But if you can,
I need your help.
- [Owl Hooting]
- [Sighs]
[Maxine]
Doug Barnum, don't you do this.
- That boy should not be in this house!
- Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.
- Go to bed, Maxine.
- If you heard the stories I've heard,
- you wouldn't want him in this house!
- Go on, go on.
- Go back to bed.
- I'm telling you, that boy should not be here.
Go to bed, Maxine.
[Sighs]
[Sighs]
She knows you're here.
[Doug]
Talk to me, woman.
Tell me what
I can do for you, Emma.
She can't go, not until she knows you're gonna get through this.
She says the both of you.
You and Steven.
Steven?
What the hell do you want me to do?
What should I do?
Throw my arms around him?
She wants you to remember the snow when Steven was younger.
And it was snowing.
You were all playing in it.
A snowball fight.
And she lost her--
Ring.
You lost your wedding ring.
You looked down at your hand, and it was gone.
We all looked.
Me and Steven, we dug through the snow all afternoon.
He came back from school every day, digging through the snowbanks, thinking he'd find it.
She cried that you both loved her so much.
The way each of you looked so hard for it.
[Sighs]
I remember that.
I do.
The silver box.
The silver box on the table.
Oh, no, Mama. No.
[Gasps, Sobs]
Oh, no.
[Sobs]
[Jeremy]
He found it at the old house... in a garden he was tilling.
He said he knew right away what it was...
- and that it was time to come home.
- [Inhales Deeply]
She says she believes in miracles now... and that you should too.
[Sighs]
She thinks I'm an angel... come to take her home.
And to bring you and Steven together again.
Remind you how much you're still in each other's hearts.
[Sighs]
Everything about each other we don't like.
You know that.
He loves you more than any man in the whole world.
And she won't go, she won't leave this place, this room or this world... until you know that you still have a son.
She'd like to feel the ring on her finger.
[Sighs]
[Doug Gasping]
[Sighing]
You can hear.
[Sniffling]
Oh, it's all right.
[Crying]
Angel, it's all right.
[Sighs]
Good-bye, Emma, sweetie.
[Car Approaching]
- Hurry!
- What?
- He's got him up there right now!
- What? What is--
He's got him up there with your mama!
[Panting]
Poppa.
[Crying]
[Continues Crying]
[Crowd Chattering]
[Chattering Continues]
[Chattering Continues]
Why don't we just tell them all to stop, and they can just take a picture or something.
Jeremy, are you okay?
They're wondering if I killed her.
Don't tell me you're seeing inside them again.
What are people like on the inside?
Inside most people there's a feeling of being separate.
Separated from everything.
And?
And they're not.
They're part of absolutely everyone and everything.
Everything?
I'm part of this tree?
Part of Zack barking over fences?
You're telling me that I'm part of some fisherman in Italy... on some ocean
I've never even heard of?
There's some guy sitting on death row.
- I'm part of him too?
- You don't believe me.
It's hard to believe that, all of that.
Well, that's because you have this spot that you can't see past.
My grams and gramps had it.
A spot where they were taught they were disconnected from everything.
So that's what they'd see if they could?
That they're connected?
And how beautiful they really are.
- [Inhales Deeply]
- And that there's no need to hide or lie.
And that it's possible... to talk to someone without any lies.
With no sarcasms, no deceptions, no exaggerations... or any of the things that people use to confuse the truth.
I don't know a single person who does that.
Hold out your hand.
Put your fingers up.
Wow.
Is that your heartbeat?
And yours.
Wow, this feels strange.
You're afraid someone will see us holding hands.
You're really nervous talking to me.
You don't think you're pretty enough.
You feel alone.
You feel so alone.
Sometimes you just want to break out of yourself.
Your father.
Your father hurt you a long time ago.
You're so sad.
He made you so sad.
He thought you were, you were ugly and... and he kept saying you, you weren't--
- [Sighs]
- I'm so sorry.
Do you?
- Do you?
- Do I what?
Do you think I'm ugly?
I don't know what I think when I look at you.
But sometimes I-I think...
I think you're the most beautiful face I've ever seen.
What?
What in the name of God do you think you're doing?
[Sighs]
You having a good time with my daughter?
Wonderful.
It's a good school, and I feel good--
You think this is funny?
- Funny man, huh?
- Dad!
- You think this is funny, huh, lover boy?
- Would you stop?
[Crowd Chattering]
- Now, I asked you a question, and I want an answer.
- Would you please let him--
[Children Screaming]
- You think it's funny?
- Dad, he wasn't doing anything!
- [Dad] Answer me!
- Mr. Kelloway!
[Jessie] Let him go.
I said, "Let him go. " Dick Kelloway, you take your hands off him now!
- I thought your boys had rules about fraternizing.
- I said now.
Keep your state trash away from my daughter.
Christ, you know nothing happened!
Is that your expert opinion?
You keep that thing on a leash or I'll slap a lawsuit... on that state zoo that will shut it down so fast it will make your head spin.
I am so sorry.
Powder.

Why don't you take a picture, man?
Hey, Skye!
[Panting]
Does this look like a genius to you?
Peeping Tom faggot, maybe.
You were gettin' an eyeful of him, weren't you, light bulb?
You want to see what a real man looks like?
Huh?
You think you can take me, freak show, go for it.
In the meantime...
I keep the hat.
When you think you're man enough to get it back, you take your best shot.
You think you're man enough to get it back?
You take your best shot, tough stuff.
What did you say?
I'd beat you to shit before you got this old hat back.
That's what he said to you when he was drunk.
You were 12 years old, and he took your father's hat.
It's the only thing your real father ever left behind.
Your stepdad, John.
That's what he said to you.
"You think you're man enough to get it back?
Then take your best shot, tough stuff. "
And then he beat you bloody that night when you tried.
Hey, fuck you!
You had marks so dark, you were embarrassed to suit up for gym.
I ought to kill you right now, man.
I ought to slit your throat and spit down it while I'm doing it.
[Thunder Rumbling]
Well, what do you know.
Boogeyman's afraid of lightning.
Come on!
- What's the matter, freak show?
- Leave him alone, Johnny! Jesus Christ!
- He's scared to death!
- Bullshit, Mitch!
He got a free show.
Now we get one.
[Laughing]
Now that is white!
Look at that.
You're as bald as a baby.
[John] He needs some color.
Doesn't he need some color?
You definitely need some color, buddy.
- [Gasping]
- [John] Go get him.
[Thunder Rumbling]
Do it!
- Now you got some color.
- That's enough, John.
[Thunder Rumbling]
[Sighs, Chuckles]
There's not much fight in you, is there, freak show?
[Thunder Clapping]
You really think you can be like us?
Is that what you think, freak show?
Hey.
Hey, what the hell--
[Laughing]
[Laughing]
Holy shit.
[Zane] Look at this.
Look. What's going on here?
[Boys Chuckling]
- Ah. Ah! Ow! Ow!

- What's go-- What's going on?
- What the--

Jesus!
His heart stopped beating!
- You son of a bitch!
- Zane! No, no, no, no!
- Don't touch him, man!
- What the hell are you?
- Don't touch him!
- [Mitch] Come on, you assholes!
Go and get some help now!
Do it!
Hey, what the hell do you think you're doing?
- You got to be kidding me.
- Come on!
- Just get away from him, man!
- [Electricity Jolts]
Stop it, man!
Come on!
He's gone!
[Coughing]
Go get help, you idiots!
Do it!
- [Coughing Continues]
- Now!
[Gasping]
Come on, man!
You gotta get outta here!

We can track it all down.
We-We'll find every book.
Uh--
Why don't you look at me and say something?
[Sighs]
Jeremy, listen.
From the first moment
I saw you down here, scared in the dark,
I had this feeling that... that you would change everything I knew.
And maybe... this is not the right place for someone as beautiful as you.
But if you come with me...
I promise you we'll find a place that is.

Just let him come on down,

We don't want no trouble from you.
What the hell you doin', Jess?
The right thing.
[Sighs]
And if you don't see that, then why don't you just turn your head and please, please... just look the other way.
- I don't know how to do that, Jess.
- Of course you do, Doug.
Christ's sake, just, uh, you know, turn your head.
Just like that.
[Thunder Rumbling]

Let's do it.
He can't be out in this weather.
Where the hell are you gonna take him?
[Thunder Rumbling]
Let's have a talk.
Come here. Come on.
Why don't you hit the road, Harley?
- Do what?
- I said get the hell out of here.
I'm not gonna let this happen, Doug.
You're breakin' the goddamn law.
- Lucy, this is Harley--
- I said go away.
- [Lucy] Go ahead, Harley.
- [Radio Shatters]
You're out of your goddamn, motherfrickin' minds, you know that?
- All of ya!
- [Thunder Rumbles]
[Rumbling Continues]
Lucy.
Lucy, this is Harley.
I need some help out here at the Reed place.
- A couple of units would be good.
- [Thunder Rumbling]
Jeremy? Powder? Hey!
[Doug] If you're gonna go, you better go now.
Jeremy?
She didn't go someplace.
- Your wife.
- What?
I felt her go.
Not away.
Just out.
Everywhere.

Welcome to Gattaca.
You keep your workstation so clean.
- It's next to godliness.
- Godliness ...
I reviewed your flight plan. Not one error in a million keystrokes.
Phenomenal. It's right that someone like you is taking us to Titan.
Has the committee approved the mission? There's talk of delay.
You shouldn't listen to talk.
You leave in a week.
You've got a substance test.
If you have to take a substance test, report to the testing centre.
Jerome. Never shy.
Pisses on command.
- A beautiful piece of equipment.
- You tell me every time I'm here.
I see a great many in my job.
Yours happens to be exceptional.
Why didn't my folks order one like that for me?
- Have I ever told you about my son?
- No.
Remind me to, sometime.
So you're about to go up.
One week left.
Please tell me you're the least bit excited.
I'll tell you at the end of the week.
Congratulations, Jerome.
Thank you.
How many launches are there in a day? A dozen?
- Sometimes more.
- Only you watch every one of them.
If you're going to pretend like you don't care, don't look up.
The most unremarkable of events.
Jerome Morrow, Navigator 1 st Class, is about to embark -
- on a one-year manned mission to Titan, the 14th moon of Saturn.
This highly prestigious assignment was guaranteed Jerome at birth.
He has all the gifts required.
A genetic quotient second to none.
There's nothing remarkable about the progress of Jerome Morrow.
Except that I am not Jerome Morrow.
I was conceived in the Riviera.
Not the French Riviera.
The Detroit variety.
They used to say that a love child has a greater chance of happiness.
They don't say that any more.
I don't know why my mother trusted God -
- rather than her local geneticist.
Ten fingers, ten toes, that's all that used to matter... Not now.
Only seconds old, the ex act time and cause of my death was known.
Neurological condition, 60%, manic depression, 42% probability.
Attention deficit disorder,
89% probability. Heart disorder ...
... 99% probability.
Early fatal potential.
- Life expectancy: 30.2 years.
- 30 years?
- The name for the certificate?
- Vincent Anton.
That's a good name.
I know he'll do something.
You'll do something.
I quickly thought of myself as others did. Chronically ill.
Every skinned knee and runny nose was treated as a fatal threat.
The insurance won't cover it. If he fell ... There's nothing I can do.
Like most other parents then, they wanted their next child -
- to be conceived in what has become the natural way.
Your extracted eggs, Marie, -
- have been fertilized with Antonio's sperm.
We have screened two healthy boys and two very healthy girls.
Without predispositions to any inheritable diseases.
Let's select the most compatible candidate. What gender do you want?
We would want Vincent to have a brother to play with.
You have specified hazel eyes, dark hair and ... fair skin.
I've eradicated prejudicial conditions:
Premature baldness, alcoholism, propensity for violence, obesity.
We didn't want ...
Diseases, yes, but ...
We would like to leave a few things to chance.
Give your child the best start. We have enough imperfection built-in.
Your child doesn't need any additional burdens. It's still you.
Simply the best of you.
You could conceive naturally 1,000 times and never get such a result.
That's how Anton came to be.
A son worthy of my father's name.
- I'm proud of you, son.
- See how much he's grown.
When we played blood brothers -
- I understood my blood was very different from Anton's.
I'd need a lot more than a drop if I was going to get anywhere.
We played chicken.
When our parents weren't watching -
- we'd swim as far out as we dared and see who'd turn back first.
Come on, you coward!
Of course it was always me.
Anton was the stronger swimmer and had no excuse to fail.
300 million,
350 million, 400 million.
Maybe it was my love of the planets or just my dislike for this one, -
- but for as long as I remember
I've dreamed of going into space.
750 million,
800 million, 850 million.
How many astronauts are there?
I bet I could be one if I wanted.
Don't eat that. It's Pluto.
My goals didn't change a lot.
Much to my parents' dismay.
Vincent ...
Be realistic. With a heart condition like yours ...
- There's a chance my heart's fine.
- One chance in 100.
- I'll take it.
- They won't.
You've got to understand something.
You'll only get inside a spaceship to clean it.
He was right. I lied on my resume, but my real resume was my cells.
Why waste money on training me -
- when there are 1, 000 other applicants with a cleaner profile?
It is illegal to discriminate.
"Genoism", it's called.
But no one takes the law seriously.
If you refuse to tell, they take a sample from a door handle -
- or a handshake. Even the saliva on your application form.
A legal drug test can become-
- an illegal peek at your future in the company.
Sure you want to do this?
You know you're going to lose.
It was the last time we swam together. Out into the open sea.
Knowing each stroke out was one we'd have to make back.
But something was different. Every time Anton tried to pull away -
- he found me right beside him.
Until finally the impossible happened.
Vincent!
For once in our lives Anton was not as strong as he believed -
- and I was not as weak. That made everything else possible.
Like others in my situation I moved around getting work where I could.
I must've cleaned half the toilets in the state.
The underclass wasn't determined by social status or skin colour now.
- Welcome to Gattaca, gentlemen.
- Today discrimination is a science.
There's your cleaning material.
Start here and clean to the back.
I want to see my smiling face on that floor.
Dreaming of space, Your Majesty?
Come here.
Start by cleaning this space.
I knew how far away I was from my goal when I stood right beside it.
- Don't clean the glass too well.
- What do you mean?
You might get ideas.
But if the glass is clean, it'll be easier to see me on the other side.
I knew it was just brave talk.
No matter how much I studied, -
- the best test score in the world needs a blood test to match it.
I had to go to extreme measures.
The man who came didn't exactly advertise in the Yellow Pages.
Stand straight.
- How did you hear about me?
- People.
Any distinguishing marks?
Tattoos, scars, birth marks?
No.
Are you serious about this?
I hope you're not wasting my time.
- I'd give 100%.
- That'll get you halfway there.
That's an old edition, but I know it all by heart.
- The commitment is binding.
- You have somebody in mind?
For the genetic elite, success is attainable, but not guaranteed.
There is no gene for fate.
And when a member of the elite falls on hard times -
- their genetic identity becomes a valued commodity.
One man's loss is another's gain.
He's got impeccable credentials.
An unbelievable expiration date.
He'll practically live forever.
His IQ is off the register.
Better than 20/20 vision. Strong heart. He could run through a wall.
If he could still run.
He was a big-time swimming star.
You could go anywhere with this guy's DNA tucked under your arm.
- You look so right together.
- We don't look anything alike.
Nobody looks at photos today.
Christ, you could have my face.
- How do I explain the accident?
- It happened out of the country.
No one knows he broke his back. He's still a fully productive citizen.
- Just fill in his last year.
- You're a foreigner.
They don't care where you were born.
Blood has no nationality.
As long as it's got what they want, it's the only passport you'll need.
- Who lives up there?
- Well, I certainly don't.
The process of becoming him began.
Myopia is one of the most obvious signs of a disadvantaged birth.
- Isn't there another way?
- Surgery will leave scars.
It's contact lenses or a white cane.
- Besides, the colour doesn't match.
- He's right.
My eyes are prettier.
I take 25% of all you make.
If it fails, all this equipment must be returned in seven days.
- And you lose your deposit.
- Wait! You said 20%.
- It's not negotiable.
- I guess that's it.
- No. There's still the height.
How tall were you before the accident?
- His profile says he's 6' 1 ".
- I can wear lifts.
Even with lifts you're not that tall.
So what?
No ...
- We never discussed that.
- I thought you were serious.
I am. I'm not doing that.
No.
Now Jerome knew I was committed.
I endured the pain by reminding myself that when I did stand up -
- I'd be exactly two inches closer to the stars.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. Do you want to go dancing?
You had to be a right-hander.
No one orders southpaws any more.
Jerome Morrow. It's a nice name.
- It's my name.
- I can't be you without it.
What makes you think you can be me at all?
Look at this.
- Look at it.
- It's nice.
- Is it real?
- Are you colour-blind? It's silver.
Jerome Morrow was never meant to be one step down on the podium.
With all I had going for me,
I was still second best.
Me!
So how do you expect to pull it off?
I don't know, exactly.
Your signature needs work.
Soon we were put to the test.
Jerome had the genes to get into Gattaca, but not the desire.
- Do you really want to be in there?
- Not in there. Up there.
- What's up there?
- That's want I want to see, Jerome.
Call me Eugene. My middle name.
If you're going to be Jerome, you better start getting used to it.
- I must go. Where's my sample?
- In the fridge. Door on the left.
- Which pouch?
- Any of them.
- You think I should test it?
- If you like.
- What's wrong with the machine?
- You've been drinking again!
- I haven't.
- Christ, it's eight in the morning!
This is no joke.
My interview is in an hour!
- There's more vodka than piss!
- I had half a glass to celebrate.
- Friday's will be all right.
- There's only Wednesday left.
That's the one.
It's not too late to back out.
This is the last day you will be you and I will be me.
Well?
- Congratulations.
- What about the interview?
That was it.
I got it.
Of course you got it.
Each day I would dispose of all my loose skin, nails and hair.
To limit how much of my In- Valid self I'd leave in the Valid world.
Eugene prepared samples of his body matter so I'd pass for him.
Urine for the substance tests.
Blood for the security checks and vials filled with other traces.
Eugene gave me his identity while I paid the rent -
- and kept him in the style to which he'd become accustomed.
Eugene had never been called
"utero", "faith birth", "In- Valid".
As a "Valid", he suffered under the burden of perfection.
I was now a member of a new and detested segment of society.
One of those who won't accept their fate. A "borrowed ladder".
Or... a "de-gene-erate".
In the guise of Jerome Morrow
I've risen quickly in Gattaca.
Only one of the mission directors has come close to exposing me.
He may have more success exposing me in death than he did in life.
I think we can rule out suicide.
Thank you.
This will take a while.
We may have to push things back.
Irene, I want you to assist the investigators.
- That would put me behind.
- I appreciate your sacrifice.
- I won't lose my place in line?
- Your place is assured.
So kindly inform the authorities we will cooperate in any way, -
- although we can't tolerate a major disruption.
- Thank you, Irene.
- Thank you, Director.
- How will this affect the mission?
- We'll go ahead as planned.
The launch can only be this week.
Tragic though this event may be, it hasn't stopped the planets turning.
- What happened?
- I'm going up.
- End of the week.
- That soon?
- What about the mission director?
- He's dead.
Are you serious?
They found him beaten so badly they had to check his name tag.
You are serious.
There's nothing between us and ignition.
I'm going up.
- The man was murdered?
- I didn't do it.
- It'll be crawling with Hoovers.
- I'll handle the J. Edgars.
What if they do find something?
I'll be out of their jurisdiction.
We have to get drunk immediately.
Good evening, gentlemen. I hear you're leaving us, Mr. Morrow.
- We're going to miss you.
- You've opened the wine, I hope?
Pour yourself a glass, Cavendish.
How old is the specimen?
- I kissed him five minutes ago.
- I'll see what I can do.
- You want the full sequence?
- Yes.
Good luck.
- 9.3. Quite a catch.
- Yes. Quite a catch.
God, I've told Cavendish ... This has only been open five minutes!
Wine needs to breathe.
They say being weightless is the closest thing to being in the womb.
I can't believe you pulled this off.
They're sending you up there.
Up there! You, of all people.
You'll be alone in that room for a year.
- It's bigger than your tin can.
- What are you going to do?
I have my books.
I travel in my head.
I wish you had company.
Someone you didn't have to pay for.
- I wouldn't have it any other way.
- What are you going to do?
I'm going to finish this.
What's Titan like this time of year?
What's Titan like?
Titan is exactly like this.
The cloud around it is so thick, no one can tell what's underneath.
- Maybe there's nothing there.
- There's something there.
- You should be going, not me.
- Why is that?
Because up there your legs wouldn't matter.
I'm scared of heights.
I'm sorry.
Do you want this?
I'll save some for you, shall I?
I'm so sorry.
I'm really, really sorry.
Don't give me a hard time.
Give me a break.
- Come on! Help!
- I'm sorry.
I wasn't drunk ...
... when I walked in front of that car.
I stepped right out in front of it.
I'd never been more sober, ever.
- Go to sleep.
- I couldn't even get that right.
If at first you don't succeed, try, try again.
Go to sleep.
I'm proud of you, Vincent.
You must be drunk to call me Vincent.
- How much do you need?
- 20 minutes.
You can go.
It's all right, Irene.
You're excused.
We found our man. It's the only specimen we can't account for.
- Every 10 years things go our way.
- Tell me about the eyelash.
An unregistered In-Valid. A janitor.
He disappeared a few years back.
- The specimen could be from then.
- Nothing lies around here for long.
Would a janitor come back after so long to kill a man he never knew?
His profile suggests he's violent.
It also suggests he's a sick man.
There's a 90% chance he's dead.
That leaves a 10% chance he's still alive.
The owner of the eyelash is the murderer. I'll do a cross-check ...
- He has no living relatives.
- That's a damn shame, sir.
Check the entry log.
Alibis, grudges.
I see a lot of dry eyes. The mission director was not universally loved.
He was leading cutbacks in the programme.
With all due respect, sir ...
Whatever you say.
Jerome the metronome.
I could play the piano by that heartbeat of his.
- We have a suspect.
- That is a relief. Who is he?
We found an unaccounted-for specimen. Here's his picture.
- An In-Valid.
- We're still following other leads.
- I'm posting this immediately.
- I'm curious, Director.
An advantage, I should imagine, in your line of work.
- Your hiring practices ...
- Our "recruitment philosophy".
- Who do you have to be, to be here?
- We don't take common citizens.
Are they all equally excellent?
Occasionally we've had to accept candidates with minor shortcomings.
But nothing that would stop them joining the police, for example.
Now, there are enough of the right kind to warrant a new standard.
Bodies with minds to match.
Essential, as we push out further.
- Yet you still monitor performance.
- To see they meet their potential.
- And exceeding it?
- No one exceeds his potential.
If he did, we just didn't accurately gauge his potential right off.
- All right?
- Terrific.
The entry log for the past week.
What about you, Irene?
Do you have an alibi?
- I was alone.
- I find that hard to believe.
I'll take care of that for you, Mr. Morrow.
I see I'm not the only one who looks up every time there's a launch.
- It's awful about the director.
- Awful it didn't happen sooner.
Didn't he threaten to cancel your mission? Somebody did you a favour.
- Do they know who I should thank?
- They found an eyelash.
- Does it have a name?
- Just some In-Valid.
Jerome ...
I had you sequenced.
I read your profile.
I'm sorry.
Seems you're everything they say you are and more.
You're engineered just like the rest of us.
Not quite.
"Unacceptable likelihood of heart failure." That's how they put it.
The only trip I'll take in space is around the sun on this satellite.
If there's anything wrong with you,
I can't see it from where I stand.
If you don't believe me ...
Here. Take it.
If you're still interested, let me know.
I'm sorry. The wind caught it.
Please check the latest Gattaca bulletin.
Jerome. Is this the approach path we discussed?
- Absolutely, Director.
- Quite right.
Listen, I want what I ordered.
It's a completely different colour.
No. I'm bored of talking to you.
I'll call you back.
That was about your hair dye.
They've sent me "Summer Wheat".
It's too light.
"Why don't you try a change?"
We can't use it!
- I'll probably have to pay for it.
- We can't stay here.
- The idiots I have to deal with ...!
- They think I killed the director.
- What makes them think that?
- They found my eyelash.
- Where?
- In the corridor.
Thank God it wasn't in your eye.
My picture is everywhere. I can't turn around without seeing my face.
- They'll recognize me. They will!
- I don't recognize you.
They won't accept one of their elite could've suckered them for so long.
No, we do as we planned. You're
Jerome Morrow, Navigator 1 st Class.
I'm not Jerome Morrow.
I'm a murder suspect.
What are you doing?
That's more than a day's worth!
- We can't stay here.
- Stop that! Fine ... fine!
Leave if you want. But don't take that stuff. It's mine!
I would've chosen a brave partner -
- if I'd known you'd go belly-up on me at the last gasp.
You can't quit on me now.
Do you want me to wheel in there and finish the job myself?
- They are going to find me.
- You still don't understand ...
When they look at you, they don't see you any more. Only me.
Keep your lashes on your lids where they belong.
How could you be so careless?
- I'm going out.
- Where?
I want some fun before they nail me.
- Are you sure that's a good idea?
- You said not to change anything.
- Who's going?
- I'd say everybody.
If I don't go it'll look suspicious.
You don't want to look suspicious, do you?
Thanks.
Who ordered this?
What are we doing here?
I'm following a lead. Forgive me, but I'm a detective. I follow leads.
- Why should the suspect be here?
- He's an In-Valid.
- This is where the In-Valids are.
- He's an In-Valid.
He's been in hiding all these years.
You think he'll lie down for us now?
- What do you suggest?
- Go back to the scene.
Sweep the area around Gattaca.
- You're a navigator? At Gattaca?
- That's what it says, doesn't it?
- It doesn't say you're crippled.
- I hurt my leg training, you moron.
How dare you question me?
What's your number?
- Your number, you fucking flatfoot!
- What do you want? An apology?
It gets to you that I can live your dreams. I'm leaving this dirtball!
- You're harassing me!
- My mistake.
What's your number?
This is a crime scene.
What's this man doing here?
- What are you doing, old man?
- My job, sir.
- This is evidence.
- But it's just trash.
You didn't know?
Wonderful, wasn't it?
12 fingers or 1, it's how you play.
That piece can only be played with 12.
- What's all this about?
- It's probably nothing.
No. I don't want to give you a contaminated specimen. Get it?
Thanks. You never know where those swabs have been.
I want to show you something.
Come on, we'll miss it.
Come on. We'll miss it.
What did I tell you?
Strange. Your eyes look different.
- I guess it must be the light.
- Must be.
Positive match. I'm impressed.
- The cup was used recently?
- Two samples, two days.
He may have returned to the crime scene to get a drink of water.
- Or he may still work there.
- We checked all the service staff.
I don't think he cleans any more.
I think he's there in disguise.
- A borrowed ladder at Gattaca?
- Far-fetched, but not impossible.
He can't be among the elite. He's mentally and physically inferior.
Maybe he is an imposter and maybe the director found out.
Let's sample every employee intravenously.
We'd close them down for days. No, take a fingertip or a urine sample.
I suggest blood from the vein.
I hope I'm not out of line.
It's only a matter of time, sir.
What's with the plungers, Lamar?
You open up a blood bank?
The detectives fear my methods may have been compromised.
- Goddamn! Are you out of practice?
- Let me look at that.
- It's all right.
- Luckily, we have enough.
If you need any more, you can get it off his shoes.
Irene.
- So you didn't do it after all?
- I guess someone beat me to it.
I guess.
I leave in two days.
I guess you know that. But ...
That's the last.
- Something's wrong.
- He's not here.
- I say we test again.
- No. No more disruptions.
- You have a murderer in your midst.
- Your presence is more of a threat.
The window for our latest launch is open for seven days every 70 years.
- It's crucial we leave on time.
- This mission means a lot to you.
Your late colleague opposed it.
Take another look at my profile.
I haven't a violent bone in my body.
My apologies.
He won't trouble you any further.
This is not the only place we can look.
Let's start making the rounds.
I'm luckier than most.
Not as lucky as some.
- I know something about that.
- What heart problem have you had?
Did you get yours broken once?
I had this crazy idea you were more interested in the murder than in me.
You're right.
That's a crazy idea.
Would you like to dance?
It's funny. You work so hard to get away from a place ...
And when you finally get to leave, you find a reason to stay.
- A year is a long time.
- Not so long.
Just once around the sun.
Hello, I'm your detective for the evening. Please stay here.
Don't leave! Am I speaking in some strange foreign language?
Check lenses, dentures, napkins, cigarette butts, saliva off cups.
That's a familiar face.
Check him out.
- I thought you wanted to dance.
- Where are you going?
Jerome!
- Are you insane?
- Come on!
Where did they go?
Come on.
- I can't do that!
- You just did.
Don't touch your face.
Don't swallow. Clean his teeth.
Vincent!
Vincent!
Who's Vincent?
I ...
Don't say anything.
Don't say anything.
What happened?
The scars on your legs?
Remember the '99 Chrysler LeBaron?
I bumped into the front fender.
Looked left instead of right.
- Is that the new or the old excuse?
- The old one.
- You are involved with the murder.
- That's not true, Irene.
Isn't that the man from last night?
He's nobody.
He's one of our best. He has nothing to do with this business.
Jerome Morrow.
You don't look well, Jerome.
Why don't you go home?
- Yes?
- Jerome Morrow.
He's ill. A little nausea.
It's quite common before a mission.
I want to visit him. I understand you can show me the way.
You don't know who he is, do you?
- Hello?
- Be yourself today.
- I was never very good at it.
- Tell the investigators you're ill.
- How long have I got?
- Not long.
I guess he's not home.
- I'm here to see Jerome Morrow.
- That's me. Come up.
I guess he's home.
Come in.
Come in.
Come in.
Hello, sweetheart.
Where's my kiss?
- Good to see you're feeling better.
- Of course, now that you're here.
Who's your friend? How can I help?
- It's about the director.
- Again?
- I hope it's no trouble.
- No, no.
- I won't show you around. Sorry.
- Can't we do this another time?
- This won't take a moment.
- Maybe he can tell me why I'm ill.
Who were you expecting?
- We have our man in custody.
- I'll come right away.
- How are you, Jerome?
- Not bad, Jerome.
- How the hell did you get up here?
- I can walk. I've been faking it.
Irene ...
Don't touch me!
I don't even know who you are.
- I'm the same as I was yesterday.
- No more lies, Jerome.
My name is Vincent Anton Freeman.
I'm a faith birth or a de-gene-erate or whatever. But I'm not a murderer.
- You're a God-child?
- We do have one thing in common.
Only I don't have 20-30 years left in mine. It's 10,000 beats overdue.
- It's not possible.
- You know what isn't possible.
Don't you, Irene?
They've got you looking so hard for any flaw, that that's all you see.
For whatever it's worth, I'm here to tell you that it is possible.
It is possible.
Congratulations, sir. His spit was found in the dead director's eye.
While I obsessed over an eyelash, your instincts pointed the way.
So the In-Valid wasn't involved?
No, our friend acted alone. This mission meant everything to him.
He'll only live to see this launch.
Since nothing can stop the launch now, he's very, very cooperative.
- So, will you celebrate tonight?
- Of course.
- I think she likes us.
- In time she'll get used to it.
- What was he like?
- Just a cop.
- Did you get his name?
- No.
- He'll be back.
- They have their man. It's over.
No, it's not. I have to meet him.
Vincent?
My God, you have changed.
- Don't you recognize your brother?
- Are we brothers?
Our parents died thinking they'd outlived you. I had my doubts.
- What are you doing here?
- I have a right to be here.
- You don't.
- You sound as if you believe that.
I committed no murder.
You must be disappointed.
You committed fraud. You're in trouble. I can get you out of here.
- I've struggled to get here!
- You've gone as far as you can go.
There's still a million miles to go.
Can you only succeed by seeing me fail?
God! Even you are going to tell me what I can and can't do now?
I don't need any rescuing.
But you did, once.
- How do you explain that?
- You didn't beat me. I beat myself.
- Who are you trying to convince?
- Do you want me to prove it?
It's not important, Anton.
It's forgotten.
I'll prove it to you.
Do you want me to prove it?
I do.
Vincent!
Vincent! Where's the shore?
We're too far out!
Do you want to quit? Do you?
No.
Vincent!
How are you doing this, Vincent?
How have you done any of this?
We have to go back.
- No. We're close to the other side.
- Do you want to drown us both?
You want to know how I did it?
This is how I did it. I never saved anything for the swim back.
You couldn't see, could you?
That night, crossing the street.
You crossed anyway.
If you're still interested, let me know.
Sorry ...
The wind caught it.
You're flying today, aren't you?
Look at what a mess you're in.
- I have your samples ready.
- I don't need any where I'm going.
You might when you get back.
Everything you need to last you two lifetimes.
- Why have you done all this?
- So Jerome will always be here.
- Where are you going?
- I'm travelling, too.
- I don't know how to thank you.
- No, no ...
I got the better end of the deal.
I only lent you my body.
You lent me your dream.
Not until you're upstairs.
- What is this?
- New policy.
- Flight got you nervous?
- There's a problem, Lamar.
I never did tell you about my son, did I? He's a big fan of yours.
Just remember that I was as good as any and better than most.
- He wants to apply here.
- I could have gone up and back.
Unfortunately, my son's not all that they promised.
But then, who knows what he could do?
Right?
For future reference, right-handed men don't hold it with their left.
Just one of those things.
You're going to miss your flight,
Vincent.
For someone who was never meant for this world, -
- I'm suddenly having a hard time leaving it.
Of course, they say every atom in our bodies was once part of a star.
Maybe I'm not leaving.
Maybe I'm going home.
"You want to build a rocket
"and send a man into outer space,
"don't come to me.
"If you're looking for someone
"to perform a delicate brain operation,
"I'm not your man.
"But if you have any questions
"regarding the quality of a fine pair of pants, that's what I know.
I know pants."
Ohh, I had a day.
Let me tell you.
Then he says,
"what about chinos?"
Talk about slaves in ancient Egypt.
Dad.
"I know chinos."
Mom?
Those slaves were in Disneyland.
Dad?
I grew up on jeans.
Being whipped while building a pyramid's no bargain.
Overalls... now he's insulting me.
Those slaves didn't have to book the himmelmans nonstop to Boca during easter.
"Einstein knew arithmetic, Pavarotti knows singing, and I know pants."
North was positive
he was having a coronary.
"Do you know who I am?
As a rule, 11-year-olds
don't experience
cardiac events.
"Let me remind you who I am.
But for north, this was
a very stressful time.
"I'm number 6!"
North was having a difficult time with his folks,
and it was putting a damper
on what was
in all other respects
a very successful life.
How successful?
Look at the year he'd had.
Photosynthesis... the process by which carbohydrates are formed in the chlorophyll containing tissues of plants exposed to sunlight.
¶ If I were a rich man ¶
¶ diguh diguh diguh diguh ¶
¶ diguh diguh diguh diguh dum ¶
¶ all day long
I'd biddy biddy bum ¶
¶ if I were a wealthy man ¶¶ hey!
Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!
An outstanding year
by anyone's standards.
But did north's folks appreciate how special he was?
Hardly.
"I was inspecting pants before you even started wearing them,
Mr. Vice president-only because-your-father owns-the-company."
God forbid the himmelmans should stop over in Atlanta.
"I've forgotten more about belt loops than you'll know.
See this rash? Himmelman.
There's no ointment for this.
"Let me remind you who you're talking to...
"only this year's recipient of the coveted
Mr. Inseam award."
Well, that shut him up.
Dad... You know what that stupid Rachel did to me?
I saw blood in my stool this morning.
Aah!
Are you o.K.?
What's the matter, son?
Here, loosen his pants.
No, no, I'm o.K.
I'm all right.
I'm all right.
I'm o.K.
But north wasn't o.K.
This parent thing
was starting to affect
every aspect of his life.
It's turning into the wind.
What sense does that make?
It's not... uh...
Maybe it's showing us where the wind was.
What are we supposed to do with that information?
To be...
Or not to... line?
Be.
Oh.
Be.
Ball 4.
That's six in a row.
Time out.
How ya doin'?
I don't get it.
A child is born, he's given a life, but then...
He's appreciated by everyone except the folks who gave him that life.
It's just not right.
Uh, let me rephrase the question.
How's the arm?
Mr. Blankman,
I've got some problems
I have to work out.
Problems? You?
North?
So while everyone speculated
as to what could
possibly be bothering
last season's
most valuable player,
north left the field
and headed straight
for his secret spot.
Yes, north had a secret spot.
You know the kind of spot
I'm talking about...
a place that's just
ordinary to everyone else
but for some reason
is special only to you.
No matter where it is,
it's the spot where you can go
and feel away from everyone
and everything,
the spot where you can go
and do your best thinking.
The one place where you can go
to reflect upon what was,
mull over what is,
or just sit back,
close your eyes,
and change the world
into whatever
you wish it could be.
It's my guess even north
couldn't remember
when his spot first revealed
its special powers to him,
nor did it matter
at this point.
What was important
was whenever he sat
in that huge armchair,
he looked like any other kid
waiting for his parents to finish their easter shopping.
He was sitting on that spot
the first time I saw him.
Why don't they like me?
What did I do wrong?
You o.K., kid?
Yeah.
Good, 'cause I only got a 10-minute break, and my back is killing me.
The last thing I need is to listen to somebody else's problems.
You hungry?
No, thanks.
Good,
'cause I'm starving, and this is my last carrot.
So, who are you?
I'm north.
Seen your name on maps.
Very impressive.
Who are you?
I'm the easter bunny... third floor, toys.
At least until Sunday.
Then what do you do?
Whatever I want.
Independently wealthy.
4th of July,
I might be Uncle Sam.
Christmas... maybe Santa claus.
My life's a holiday.
How about yours?
Not lately.
I had a bad game today.
How bad?
I walked nine panthers and hit my coach's wife with a wild pitch.
That's bad.
You got something on your mind?
Well?
What is it?
Thought you didn't want to hear anyone else's problems.
You always believe everything strangers tell you?
Come on, spill.
Aw, you wouldn't understand.
Try me.
It's my folks.
Yeah, what about 'em?
I don't know.
All they care about is themselves.
Selfish folks. That is rough.
They don't know what a good thing they got in you.
Exactly, and they're the only ones.
You should hear what the other parents say about me.
North's room is always clean.
North always looks both ways.
North never spoils his appetite.
North flosses.
Holy mackerel. Your folks are sitting on a gold mine.
Tell me about it.
You realize, of course, you're not alone.
What do you mean?
Look, kid, just because
I'm in a bunny suit doesn't mean I haven't stumbled across some basic truths.
The feeling of being insufficiently appreciated is a common childhood lament.
I'm not common.
Course not, but I'll bet you that even
Wolfgang amadeus Mozart... who wrote a symphony by the age of 3... had some evenings there with an angry parent yelling,
"stop banging on that damn piano."
But Mr. Mozart's dead and I'm alive, so I'll bet you that right now
I'm in more pain than he is.
Hard to argue with that one.
At this point,
I'd even settle for Mozart's parents.
Unfortunately, you don't get to make that choice.
The one thing we cannot control is who our parents are.
You're dealt a hand, you're stuck with it.
It's not like baseball, where you can become a free agent and try to get a better deal with another team.
Another team...
This is real life, kid.
The rules are different.
I got to get back upstairs.
You want my advice... and I know you didn't ask for it... go home, make up, and goodbye.
And that was it.
Nothing special.
I just left him there
in that secret spot of his,
just him and his thoughts.
Free agency.
What a scoop!
A kid becoming a free agent, then offering his services as a devoted son to the highest-bidding set of parents.
It's brilliant, north, simply brilliant!
This still isn't for sure yet.
This could be my Watergate.
Winchell, you put out a two-page leaflet with a circulation of 90.
Might land me a pulitzer.
I told you this as my friend, not as editor of the school newspaper.
I'm a journalist, north.
You never said this conversation was off the record.
I need time to think.
I'll hold the story, but a few more displays like that panther game, and some parents may start doing some thinking of their own.
That damn panther game.
And that geography test we took today?
What about it?
You got a 34.
Chicago's in Africa?
Mexico... an island off the coast of Montana?
Where'd you get this?
I'm a journalist, north.
I can't reveal my sources.
How I got this test isn't important.
Why you got this grade is.
Your instincts are correct.
You need new parents, and you need them now.
Unless...
Unless what?
Unless you haven't got the guts.
I've got more guts than anybody in this town.
Eh, talk is cheap.
I just feel I owe it to my parents to give them one last chance.
What can I say?
You came to me, sought my counsel.
The rest is up to you.
No, no, that's o.K.
Thanks, anyway.
North wanted to give his folks
every chance to keep
the family together.
He tried his mom,
but she was too busy
rerouting the himmelmans.
That left dad.
Pants. Can I help you?
My name is north.
Can I talk to my dad?
What number?
Number 6.
Looks like that 5-iron's a little short.
Number 6.
Number 6! Phone call.
Oh, uh, prom season.
Get a number, would you?
It's your son.
All right. Just a minute.
Is that piping holding up?
Very well, Mr. Vice president.
Now he's an expert on piping.
Hello.
Dad, can I talk to you for a minute?
Yes, north.
We need these by 5:00.
I only got two legs!
North, I'm swamped.
Could we discuss this over dinner?
But, dad...
We'll discuss it over dinner.
Yeah, right.
Dinner.
Well, that's that.
O.K., guys, let's roll.
Zoe, you take the South side.
Winchell!
Winchell!
Here you go.
Here you go.
I've made my decision.
Let me guess.
How did you know?
News travels fast.
Apparently.
You got a lawyer?
Do I need one?
This is America.
Everyone needs a lawyer.
I happen to know the best.
Name's Arthur belt.
Let's move it.
Where will I find him?
Don't worry. He'll find you.
We got a paper to get out!
Hello, north.
Arthur belt at your service.
The lawyer?
Your lawyer.
We're a team.
You do what I tell you to do, you're going to have the best parents in the world.
You sure you can squeeze me in?
What?
Oh, the "ambulance chasing" thing.
Ha ha.
That's nothing.
I just use it to beat traffic.
Try it sometime on your bike.
Are we a team?
Yeah, I guess so.
Hey, hey, hey. You know so.
Yes, north was actually
going to go through with it
and challenge the entire
concept of family.
The effect was immediate,
as kids now faced their parents
with confidence they once
only dreamed about.
What a great idea.
North's a genius.
Jeffrey, don't be ridiculous.
Now, where did I put that phone number for Arthur belt?
Did I say ridiculous?
What I meant was, you look very handsome today.
You realize north will never pull this off?
He's north. He can do anything.
His folks will fight it.
They won't take this lying down.
And then
the media circus began.
How do you feel?
Is winchell's story accurate?
Can we take that as a "yes"?
You think you can pull this off?
No comment.
North, if you're successful, how will your actions affect mother's day?
No comment!
In 1793, the cotton gin was invented.
North, could you please tell us the name of the inventor?
E-e... o.K.
Under strict advice from counsel,
I must respectfully say no comment.
Finally, north's day
in court arrived.
The world was watching.
All rise for the honorable judge buckle.
All sit for the honorable judge buckle.
Now, then, this is a trial, not a hearing.
Even though both sides will be saying things and I'll be hearing them, it is still not a hearing.
No doubt you'll be hearing the same things I'm hearing.
That's your privilege.
However, once both sides have been heard, it'll be my job to pass judgment.
Obviously, you can pass judgment, too, but it won't count.
That's because I'm the judge.
Have I made myself clear to the plaintiff?
Yes, your honor, it's quite clear to the plaintiff.
Have I made myself clear to the defense?
Your honor, the defense rests.
Then there's nothing left to do but make my judgment, and in my judgment, any folks who would sleep through this trial don't deserve a son like north!
I rule in favor of the plaintiff.
Yes!
Yes! Yes!
The system works.
North, you're a free man.
Hold on.
Hold on.
¶ Israel was in Egypt land ¶
¶ let my people go ¶ everybody!
¶ Go down, Moses ¶
Hey! Hey! Pipe down!
¶ Go down, Moses... ¶¶ this is a court of law.
Even though I have made a judgment, the trial isn't over.
I still have to make a ruling.
Now, then, today is...
July 1st.
Today is July 1st, and it's my ruling that north choose his new parents by labor day so he can begin school with his new family.
If he does not choose new parents, he may return to his original parents.
However, if he is not physically in the arms of either his new parents or his original parents by noon on labor day, he will be remanded to an orphanage.
And if any of you has ever seen the little rascals, you know that's no day at the beach.
Orphanage?
Not to worry.
From now own, the world is your oyster.
Even though north didn't
really care for oysters,
he couldn't help but take
Arthur belt's enthusiasm
as a positive sign.
North free agent draft.
Yes, his eyes are blue.
Soprano.
Super Mario III.
He believes in God and evolution.
Don't even get him started on the Warren commission.
Everyone wants you, kid.
Everyone.
Look at this.
You got a first class ticket to every city in the world.
My advice is, don't spread yourself thin.
Learn as much as you can about the parents you audition.
Once you sign with someone, that's it.
They're your new folks forever. Understand?
You bet.
That's the spirit.
Let's get cracking.
So north was on his way.
It was the 4th of July.
This year, independence day
had a special meaning
for north.
He was a free man
searching for the life
he felt he deserved.
There he is.
Look at that boy.
There he is, pa.
Well, hey, howdy, north.
I'm pa Texas. Here's ma Tex.
And welcome to the great state of Texas.
Uh, howdy.
I know what you're thinkin'.
Big car, right?
Well, it did cross my mind.
Everything I own's the biggest and the best.
That's why we'd like you to become our son.
'Cause you're the best.
To the best.
Home, sweet home.
This can all be yours, son... the main house, guest house, livestock, oil Wells.
Rumor has it you like baseball.
I used to own the Houston astros.
Really? What happened?
Just this morning, I signed them over to you.
Gee, don't get me wrong.
They're a fine organization, but aren't we rushing things?
Pretty fair shootin', Gabby.
Thanks, boss.
Hey...
What are you doing here?
Finished all my chores.
Figured I'd get some shootin' in.
No, I... I mean...
Have you ever been an easter bunny?
Easter bunny?
Careful, son.
Gabby's killed men for less than that.
Sorry.
No harm done.
So, what you two cowpokes got planned for tomorrow?
We'll wake up early and eat, then dig for oil and eat, then rope doggies and bust broncs, then maybe grab a bite to eat.
You like Tex-mex?
I'm a fan of any food that straddles two borders.
That's my boy.
But what's the deal with all this eating?
It's simple.
Remember I told you everything I own's the biggest and best?
You're already the best.
There's nothing left but to make you the biggest.
And don't fret about not being able to clean your plate.
Pretty soon that stomach of yours will stretch and stretch, and your capacity for food will grow and grow.
Excuse me. You say that like that's a good thing to have happen to your stomach.
It is.
Why?
Well, then you'll be like buck.
Who?
Our first son.
Biggest boy this big state's ever seen.
He could eat more in one day than anyone else eats in a month.
That's why buck hated February.
Where is buck?
He died in a stampede.
Oh.
I'm so sorry.
It was a mighty big loss.
Now we'll show you how much we're lookin' forward to making you our new son.
Ready, pa?
Ready, ma.
¶ We had a son who was trampled ¶
¶ by a ton of longhorns ¶
¶ but you're here, cutes ¶
¶ to fill his boots ¶
¶ as flat as they may be ¶
¶ you'll yell yippee-ai-o at the rodeo ¶
¶ till the day's done ¶
¶ then you'll make a lot of pals ¶
¶ with buffalo gals ¶
¶ just leave some for me ¶
¶ we'll barbecue steaks and stew ¶
¶ feed you pumpkin pie ¶
¶ till your can's bigger than ¶
¶ the big ol' Texas sky ¶ yee-hah!
Yee-hah!
Yee-hah!
Yee-hah!
Whoo!
¶ You'll grow tall and play football ¶
¶ be famous ¶
¶ you'll grow more, own a chain of stores ¶
¶ marry Betty Lou ¶
¶ oh, north ¶
¶ north ¶
¶ grow, north ¶¶
'nother rib, son?
You o.K., cowboy?
Yeah.
Just thinking.
Texas nights are sure good for thinking.
Yeah.
You doing any particular type of thinking or just wandering thinking?
I was thinking if I stay here,
I'll always be living in the shadow of someone else.
What kind of life would that be?
From what I hear about buck, what kind of shadow would that be?
Yeah, he was a big one.
Mighty hard being your own man when they're always comparing you to somebody else.
Yeah, right.
I mean, I left home because I had parents who didn't appreciate who I was.
Why would I want new parents who'd only appreciate me if I was someone else?
You might be onto something there, son.
You know, down here in these parts we got a saying... sometimes when you're panning for gold, you got to try more than one stream.
We really wish you'd reconsider.
I'm sorry, but it wouldn't be fair to any of us.
Thanks for the opportunity, north.
Oh, sir?
Yes, north?
I think it's only right
I give you back the astros.
Well, thanks, son.
That's a class gesture.
Well...
Goodbye.
So long, pard.
We'll miss you.
Hold on there, son.
Just a little something to remember your old buddy Gabby by.
Hope it brings you good luck.
Thanks.
So north resumed his search,
and though he got
to the airport by noon,
out of respect
for ma and pa Tex,
in true cowboy tradition,
he chose to wait eight hours
to fly off into the sunset,
with no knowledge at all
of what was going on back home.
How much longer do we have to put up with this indignity?
How much longer must we tolerate these injustices?
The subservience?
It's humiliating, my friends.
It's demeaning.
Right on!
Now is the time to say no!
Now is the time to say,
"just because you were born
25 or 30 years before me
"doesn't make you smart.
"It doesn't make you right.
It just makes you old!"
"It just makes you smell worse in the morning!"
Now is the time to band together and let our parents know we're at the dawn of a new era... the era of our liberation!
An era made possible by a kid who had the guts to fight for the power we now possess!
And now the man whose brilliant legal mind shone the light on the pathway to freedom...
Mr. Arthur ulysses belt, esquire!
Thank you!
I am but a humble servant, standing at your ready, to assist in this noble cause!
Viva El norte!
Viva El norte!
Viva El norte!
Viva El norte!
Viva El norte!
But like I said,
north didn't know
about any of this.
He was on his way to Hawaii
to meet what he hoped
would be his new parents.
Governor and Mrs. ho?
Aloha, north.
Welcome to our island paradise, north.
Aloha.
We've got a big day planned for you.
Waki-waki will take you to the house to change.
Aloha.
Aloha?
I thought that meant hello.
In Hawaii, aloha means hello and goodbye.
Doesn't that get confusing?
Only when you're firing someone.
Oh, well, aloha.
Isn't he great?
You know, north, if you settle here, you'll be many years younger because of the difference in time zones.
You won't die as early as you would if you lived on the mainland.
That's a plus.
Another thing, north.
If you live in Hawaii, it's much easier to get into a good college.
How's that?
We have only 12 letters in our alphabet.
Really?
That's right. Five vowels...
A-e-I-o-u.
Seven consonants.
H-k-l-m-n-p-w.
I didn't know that.
Well, sure.
Just think about it.
Waikiki, Honolulu...
Kaanapali, mauna lani.
That's very interesting, but how does that help me get into college?
Since we don't use the letters b-c-d and "f", you're pretty much guaranteed to get straight as.
What do you think?
Well, I like what I see, but I do have one question, just for my own peace of mind.
What is it?
I hope I'm not being insensitive, but you wouldn't have a dead kid whose shoes you want me to fill?
Dead kid?
North, Hawaii is a lush and fertile land.
There's only one barren area on all of our islands.
Unfortunately, it's Mrs. ho.
But if all goes right, you will be our first child.
Wow!
What a great day.
You know, this might really work out.
As far I'm concerned, there's just a few minor details to discuss.
You know, bedtime, sleepovers, your views on snacks.
That sort of thing.
What are we standing here for?
Let's go inside and push a few numbers around, see what we come up with.
Ladies and gentlemen,
governor and Mrs. ho.
Heahea 'oe!
Komo mai e kai e ku aloha!
Ladies and gentlemen, fellow 50th staters,
I am thrilled to announce that we have reached an agreement in principle which allows me to introduce to you today a young man, who in coming years will be to Hawaii what the peach is to Georgia, the apple is to New York, the wind is to Chicago!
Now, without further ado, please give a big, warm
Hawaiian welcome to our new pride and joy... our son north!
What is that?
Son, that'll be in every airport, along every highway...
My crack?
My crack is going to be shown in every airport?
What gives you the right to show my crack on every highway?
The truth is, north,
I'm governor of a state running low on self-esteem.
After 35 years of statehood, people still don't treat Hawaii like we're part of the country.
Sure, there's a star for us on the flag, but why didn't anyone show up during "hands across America"?
Not even a phone call.
It's just plain inconsiderate.
He's right.
People from the mainland just don't care about Hawaii.
They come with their knobby knees and pale kids, eat our food, watch our whales, say "aloha," like they really mean it.
7 to 10 days later, they drop us like a sack of rancid poi.
We're supposed to feel good about ourselves?
Excuse me. What's this have to do with my crack?
Don't you see, north?
If you lived here in Hawaii, people would be more inclined to settle here.
So they can be close to my crack?
North, north...
You're very important to us.
I don't know.
I need some time to think, o.K.?
1, 2, 3, 4 Jacks!
Come on, guys!
Don't just stand there.
Get your butt in motion!
You might just like it!
And squat down, up and...
What is the point?
Gabby, what are you doing here?
They say for every hour you exercise, you add an hour to your life.
Who needs all that extra time if you're just going to spend it exercising?
See where I'm going?
Who's Gabby?
A ranch hand from Texas.
Not familiar with the gentlemen.
So, how's it feel to be Hawaii's new first son?
Well, I'm not so sure that's what I want to be.
Why not?
Beautiful climate.
Can't beat the fashion.
Yeah, I know, but I don't think I should settle for parents who have to show my most private crevice on a billboard to feel better about themselves.
It's refreshing to meet a kid who has such strong convictions about his crack.
Whoa! Whoa.
Ah!
Dig, man.
The way I always figured this deal is parents are supposed to make the kids feel better.
Not the other way around.
Yeah.
Hang in there, kid!
You'll find what you're looking for.
I hope so.
Although he came up short
in both Texas and Hawaii,
north felt no anxiety,
as he still had eight weeks
till his labor day deadline.
Welcome to Juneau, Alaska.
Remain seated until the plane comes to a complete stop
in Anchorage, Alaska.
To accompany our skid,
we'll be showing another
full-length feature film.
Our friend had a dream, and that dream is becoming a reality.
Meanwhile, as north
was skidding
his way to Anchorage,
things were heating up at home.
Winchell's
inspirational speeches
had created a groundswell,
and all across the land,
kids continued holding
their parents
at emotional gunpoint.
Anything else, son?
Yes. How's my room coming along?
I'll have it spotless by dinner.
Viva El norte.
And as of next Monday, no parent will be permitted to see an r-rated movie unless accompanied by a kid.
Yeah, right.
Arthur, do I detect a note of melancholy?
It's just that north still hasn't found new parents.
Maybe he never will.
Maybe this free agency thing will blow up in our face.
I'm surprised at you.
Do you think I'd embark on an endeavor of this magnitude without a contingency plan?
Contingency plan?
Oh, good. I love those.
One Coca-Cola.
Right here.
And one sex-on-the-beach.
Aren't I naughty?
To our future.
What a future it is.
According to the latest polls, parents are so nervous, that 78% of them say they'll vote however their kids tell them to.
And since those kids will do whatever you tell them to...
Well, I, uh...
What I mean is...
That's right.
I'm lying here with the next president of the United States.
I'm happy for you, Arthur.
I'm sure you'll make a fine commander-in-chief.
Hey, dollface, could you concentrate on my lower back?
That's where all my tension builds up.
Flight 24 from Hawaii
by way of Juneau
is now arriving at gate seven.
Approach 119-90.
Hey, great landing, guys.
You've really got that skid thing down to a science.
Thanks for the kind words, north.
We've dented a terminal now and then, but eventually you get the hang of it.
Thanks.
North's first impression
of Alaska
was a positive one.
The air was clean,
it was breathtakingly
beautiful,
and, best of all,
it was far away from
everyone and everything.
There was nothing
to distract these people
from concentrating on life's
most precious commodity...
the love of a good family.
Morning!
Whoa ho!
Here you go, north.
A nice cup of hot cocoa.
And to go with that, our state dish... eskimo pie.
Thank you.
Hey, what do you know?
The salmon are running.
I'm going to get poles and go fishing with my boy.
Great! I love fishing.
This is the life, right, son?
Sure is.
You like Christmas, north?
Who doesn't?
You've never had a Christmas till you've had an Alaskan Christmas.
Since our days last for months at a time, you can imagine the festivities.
Why, opening presents takes three weeks alone.
Right, ma?
This all sounds great, but what's the catch?
What do you mean?
I mean, what's in it for you?
Nothing.
Really?
No dead kids?
No low self-esteem?
No frozen skeletons in your closet?
We have pride, north, and we're proud of our pride.
We wouldn't ask anything of a child.
We want you to follow your dreams and be the best north you can be.
You'll be a source of pride to the entire eskimo community for many, many years to come.
Oh, jeepers creepers, that reminds me.
Oh, dad, let's go!
Time to flow!
Coming!
Time to what?
Bundle up. It's a long walk.
Who's that?
North, this is your new grandfather.
Hello, north.
Hello. What do you mean
"it's time to flow"?
When an eskimo gets too old or weak to contribute to society, the whole family gets together and walks to the ocean.
Then the revered old eskimo is proudly placed on an ice floe and set out to sea to die with dignity.
And pride.
All right, everybody, let's go.
But wait a minute.
Just because he's old doesn't mean he can't be part of the family.
Well, it's a tradition.
I promise you, north, grandpa wants this as much as anyone. Right, grandpa?
Yeah, right. I've been looking forward to this.
As the family made
their long trek to the sea,
north took the opportunity
to get close to his
new grandpa,
which was easy,
since he had a tremendous
affection for old folks.
He found them warm,
understanding,
and, most importantly,
way too tired to yell.
Knowing his time
with grandpa was limited,
north tried to take in
all this wise old man
had to offer
about life in the tundra.
And another thing. Up here, if your mother says
"don't make a face because it could freeze in the position," you better take her seriously.
Can't you hang around a little longer?
There's so much you can teach me.
Next!
Goodbye.
Yeah, o.K. O.K.
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.
Let's go. I only got four months of sunlight.
Next. Let's go!
Come on. Come on.
Should've done this before.
I've got a civilization to run here.
Move along.
Next!
Don't act like you don't know what's going on.
Well, goodbye, north.
Are you sure you have to go?
Don't worry about him, north.
He's had a great life.
He's happy to set sail before he starts embarrassing himself.
Take it from us, north.
When drool hardens, it's not a pretty sight.
Let's go, pal.
This is no surprise.
Take a walk. Let's go. Move it.
Yeah, bye, bye.
Fine. Thank you.
Bye, dad!
Bye, dad!
Bye.
Listen, if there's a change in policy the next couple of weeks, feel free to track me down.
What did he say?
What do you say we grab a ride home?
Great idea!
North, don't worry about grandpa.
He'll be o.K.
Yeah.
Can I ride on top?
Why, sure. It's the best view.
Landscape sure is beautiful up here.
Hey...
It's you.
No, it's not.
Oh.
Smell that fresh air.
No smog up here.
How could they do that?
Not even my original parents would send my grandpa away like that.
Hey, son!
How's the view up there?
Great!
Thanks.
"Son."
I don't want to overstep my bounds, but unless I'm mistaken, you're that fella north.
Unless I'm further mistaken, you have a deadline of labor day... a week from tomorrow... to choose new parents.
You still haven't found what you're looking for.
How could labor day be next week?
I just got here.
You walked from home to the ice floes?
It's a seven-week walk, even with the wind at your back.
No wonder we stopped for lunch 49 times.
That six months of daylight thing throws everybody off.
I only showered 12 times during the seventies.
Oh, man, I'll never find new parents.
You can always go back to your original parents.
Oh, yeah!
That's just what I want to do... go back to the people who haven't even tried to contact me.
Take me to the airport.
I've got lots to do and not much time.
You got it. Yah!
So a now-desperate north,
with time running out,
raced towards
an uncertain future.
Understandably, he was upset
that his parents hadn't
called in two months,
but his parents hadn't
done much of anything
in two months.
As curator of the Smithsonian institution, it is my distinct honor to unveil the newest addition to our illustrious hall of achievement.
At 78 consecutive days and counting, the longest simultaneous coma in medical history, ladies and gentlemen, north's folks.
I'll now take questions.
Yes!
How can you equate a medical oddity with man's landing on the moon?
With all due respect to the achievements of the Apollo 11 crew, the sociological impact of what these folks did dwarfs those of Mr. Armstrong et Al.
All they did was faint.
And in so doing, shifted the familial balance of power throughout the world.
"Throughout the world"?
This is even bigger than we thought.
It's bigger than you thought.
That's why you're only going to be president.
...Child's continuing process to improve status...
I just thought of something.
What if they wake up in the next eight days, begging north to come back?
What if north goes back to his folks?
Arthur, don't you know that that's an impossibility, that I would use all my power to prevent a thing like that from happening?
Oh.
What do you say we grab some Chinese?
Maybe the msg will calm you down.
Despite north's growing concern
about his approaching deadline,
he took solace in the fact
the lord needed
only six days to create
the entire universe.
A kid of his caliber,
given an extra two days,
should be able to find
two measly parents.
Greetings...
North.
I'm thy new father, and this good woman, who art my wife, art thy new mother.
And these art thy new brothers, who art named Ezekiel.
And these art thy new brothers, who art named art.
Hey, hey, this looks great.
I've always dreamt of a life without the ever-present nuisance of electricity.
Just let me grab something from the plane.
I seem to have left my butter churn in the overhead compartment.
Floor it!
While it wasn't like north
to make snap judgments,
there were only
seven days left.
He had a world of potential
parents to evaluate.
Long live the north dynasty!
Give him the emperor cut.
Honey!
Honey face!
You seem like very nice folks, but to be totally honest with you, if I lived here,
I'm not sure I'd get much homework done.
Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha!
Quiet, Harry! Quiet!
I think he's trying
to tell us something.
¶ Wack wack wack-ado ¶¶
Oh, my!
With three days to go
before his 12 noon
labor day deadline,
north, the little
world traveler,
arrived in New York today
to interview his final
set of parents...
ward and Donna Nelson,
who, along with their
two children, bud and Laura,
live in the quaint
upstate town of bedford.
When contacted earlier
at his office,
ward, the local pediatrician,
who, we understand,
still makes house calls,
said, "my family and I
would like nothing better
"than to see north's
long journey
"finally be rewarded with
a warm and loving home,
and we hope we can
provide it for him."
Thanks.
Hi, north!
Ward, bud, Laura, he's here!
He's here!
Hi, north!
Hi!
Hello.
Welcome to our home, son.
Tired, hungry?
I'm going to bake you some chocolate chip cookies.
Do you like Nintendo?
Today at mount rushmore,
thousands of angry parents
gathered
to voice opposition to the bill
that lowers voting age to 7.
According to Arthur belt,
the rising politician
who drafted the bill...
Wait. They were talking about me.
Soon you'll be hearing your name so much, even you'll be sick of it.
I highly doubt it.
Talk to me.
Boss, it's Al with the sleeping dogs.
Yeah, what about them?
Looks like they counted their last sheep.
So it does.
How long will it take to get operation xerox into place?
Less than a minute, boss.
Go to it, and, Al?
Yeah, boss?
Don't be surprised if there's extra zeros in your next paycheck.
Thanks, boss. I appreciate it.
And, Al?
Yeah, boss?
Don't be surprised if there isn't.
I understand.
Good morning.
Where are we?
Oh! Where's our son?
Ooh! Can we see our son?
Absolutely. Just follow me.
We got a limo waiting outside with coffee and hot Danish.
Oh, that sounds good.
I seem to have worked up an appetite. Honey?
I could eat.
Right this way.
Hike!
O.K., Laura, sack the quarterback!
Here we go. Hey!
Touchdown!
You faked me right out of my socks!
Come and get it!
It's great having you here, north.
I've always wanted a brother to throw to.
Now I have two brothers to look out for me.
I know we're all excited to have north in our family, but he hasn't decided to stay.
You got to stay!
We really want you.
Help yourself, everybody. Dig in.
Mom, can we go to the carnival tomorrow?
I don't see why not.
Ward?
Sounds good to me.
North...
We miss you so much.
Please forgive us.
We made so many mistakes.
We should've appreciated you more.
If only you could give us just one more chance.
We love you, son.
We love you very much.
Cut!
Very nice.
Very, very nice.
Touching, moving, and yet, not over the top.
Keep it rolling.
So, crazy summer, huh?
Oh, terrible.
Very disturbing.
I know what you're going through, but if north doesn't come back, you can always adopt.
Just the other day,
I met this adorable little boy,
7 years old.
His name was Hugh.
Maybe you can adopt him.
Maybe Hugh can be your son.
We don't want Hugh.
He's not our son.
We want north.
I understand.
It was insensitive of me to even mention it.
Uh, you folks want more coffee?
Nah. That's o.K.
Not for me.
I still don't understand why we can't speak to north in person.
I think that would be a big mistake.
North is very angry right now, very sensitive.
You show up unannounced, and this could blow up in your face, and it'd just kill me to see that happen.
My suggestion is, you lay low for a while.
I'll have someone escort you to the Plaza.
I told Jean Pierre to give you any room service, and as north's best friend,
I'd happily show him this tape to pave the way for you.
Thank you, winchell.
Oh, yes.
You're a real friend.
I try.
Bring the car around for north's folks.
Yes, sir. Consider it done.
You know, you're doing very well for a sixth-grader.
Well, I cut a few breaks.
Adam, take the tape down to editing.
Colonel mustard in the study with the rope.
I don't have any of those.
Neither do I.
Me, neither.
Let's see.
Colonel mustard in the study, and here's the rope.
All right!
Good job, kitten.
Can we play again?
No. You have to hit the sack.
You don't want to be tired for the carnival.
Everybody upstairs to bed right now.
O.K. Good night.
Good night, honey.
Good night, north.
Good night.
Brush your teeth before you go to bed.
Ahem.
Sorry to bother you, but I got something important for a kid named north.
What is it?
Apparently an urgent message from his original parents.
I'll see he gets it.
Thank you.
North, honey?
Yeah?
Can you come down here for a minute?
Coming.
What is it?
North, a man just left this tape.
It's a message from your parents.
From my parents?
Do you mind if I... of course not.
Would you like to be alone, north?
No. That's o.K.
After all you've been through,
what would you like
to say to your son?
We don't want Hugh.
How can you say that?
He's not our son.
Aren't you bothered
you might never see
your son again?
Nah. That's o.K.
Isn't this a gut-wrenching,
torturous, emotional
experience?
Not for me.
He's not our son.
We don't want Hugh.
North, honey, are you o.K.?
Is there anything we can do for you?
Yeah.
Let me be your son.
Finally, north
had new parents...
parents who made him
feel wanted, secure,
and loved,
yet something was still wrong.
The nelsons were everything
he was looking for,
so why couldn't he
embrace them?
North needed answers.
North, we just don't understand why you're leaving.
Neither do I.
You're all nice people.
I'm really gonna miss you, but I've just got to be alone.
We're going to miss you, too.
And so will Oliver.
North.
Here.
In case you get hungry on your way to New York.
Thanks, mom...
I mean, Mrs. Nelson.
Bye.
So with just 24 hours until
his labor day deadline,
no hope of parents,
and the prospect
of an orphanage looming,
north felt he only
had one option left.
He would disappear.
Can you spare some extra change?
Oh.
Here.
Maybe it'll bring you more luck than it brought me.
Hey, it's got a hole in it!
What good does this do me?
Yes, he would disappear,
and where better to do that
than amidst the teeming,
faceless masses
of the naked city?
Want to go downtown?
Shut up!
He's heading into the park.
Don't worry, boss. I'm just looking for the right place.
So long, Al.
What was that all about?
It seems our young friend's had a change of heart.
Change of heart?
He's left the nelsons and decided to grace our city with his presence.
Oh, no.
This ruins everything.
Arthur, please, use your head.
This is a godsend.
It is?
Of course.
As we speak, grownups across this great land of ours are feeling humiliated.
They blame north for all their frustrations.
Do you realize how many of those angry parents would like nothing better than to do away with our little friend?
And do you know the one catalyst that can give a political movement true cohesion?
That's right.
A martyr.
You're a genius.
I mean, it's brilliant.
It's absolutely winchellian.
It... it...
But for north to be martyred, doesn't he have to be killed?
Well, maybe we'll get lucky.
As north ran for his life,
he wondered how his dream
of finding perfect parents
had turned into a nightmare.
Aah! Aah!
Damn it.
Psst! North.
Over here.
Adam, what are you doing here?
Listen to me very carefully.
I'm not here. You never saw me.
We're not even having this conversation.
Got that?
Got what?
Perfect.
So what are we not talking about?
This.
What? I don't see anything.
What you don't see is a tape of the conversation winchell had with your parents.
I saw it.
No, you didn't.
Oh, I forgot. I didn't see it.
You did see it, and this is what you didn't see.
I see.
I don't think you do.
Look at the tape.
So how'd you find me?
Winchell. He bugged the nelsons' phones.
Winchell? Shh!
He's everywhere.
I been working for him ever since you left home.
You know, some guy was chasing me with a gun.
He was shooting at me.
That didn't have anything to do with winchell, did it?
Oh, man.
So why are you doing this?
I'm not, but if I was, because I think winchell's gone too far.
Also, you were always good to me, north.
You never picked me last.
You never made me play right field.
Thanks, Adam.
Oh, man.
Adam, I just don't feel safe anywhere.
Adam?
Adam?
Can I have a hot dog with just mustard?
That'll be $1.00.
Out of 5.
There you go.
Where did you get this?
Some bum bought a hot dog from me. Why?
No reason.
Aah!
Aah!
We won't see him no more.
Watch, watch, watch!
Watch there.
Excuse me.
Move it, kid.
Come on, move it.
Which reminds me of this man that walked into a bar.
He sits down next to a very beautiful young lady.
Before you know it, the conversation turns to sex.
He says to her,
"my darling, do you smoke after making love?"
She says, "I don't know.
I never looked."
"But I'll tell you one thing, my smoke alarm never went off."
Good night, folks.
You've been great.
Thank you.
You the kid with the tape?
Yeah.
Good. Come in. I want to try my new vcr.
How did you know?
I came to see you because you looked familiar.
I look familiar because
I'm almost famous.
Joey fingers, and you're?
North.
One of my favorite directions.
Mal-o-mar?
No, thanks.
That bad, huh?
What?
No kid ever refuses a mal-o-mar unless he's wrestling with heavyweight problems.
North, we miss you so much.
Please forgive us.
We made so many mistakes.
We should've
appreciated you more.
If only you could give us just one more chance.
We love you, son.
We love you very much.
Beautiful. Works like a charm.
You got some pretty nice folks there, kid.
Huh?
I said you got some pretty nice folks there.
Yeah.
I guess so.
What do you mean?
What did they mean by "give us one more chance?"
I thought they didn't love me.
What are you, nuts?
That's the thing.
They didn't always pay that much attention to me.
I left them to find folks who'd appreciate me.
I searched the whole world, but nobody was good enough... not even the nelsons, who I just left, and they weren't bad folks.
Maybe there's something wrong with me.
Ah, there's nothing wrong with you.
I'm sure the nelsons weren't bad folks.
They just weren't your folks.
You see those people out there?
That audience?
They paid attention to me.
They listened.
They laughed. They screamed.
They applauded.
They loved me, but do you think that audience would make me a cup of tea if I'm ill?
You think they're going to give me advice when I fight with my best friend or I get in girl trouble?
Who will I turn to?
Give you a hint.
It's not that audience.
My God, what have I done?
I'll tell you what you've done.
You've realized something it takes most people a whole lifetime to figure out... that a bird in the hand is always greener than the grass under the other guy's bushes.
It's a metaphor used mostly by gardeners and landscape people in general.
Hey, kid!
Hey, kid! Where are you going?
Home. I miss my parents.
How? You got a car?
No. I'm 11.
Then we better take mine.
The white zone
if for immediate loading
and unloading
of passengers only.
No parking.
Thanks for everything,
Mr. Fingers.
Make it Joey, and you're welcome.
Remember, if you can't stand the heat, leave Miami.
What does that metaphor mean?
What metaphor? You ever been there in August?
Your balls stick to your leg like crazy glue.
So north finally found
the parents
he'd always been looking for.
Much to his surprise,
they were his own.
So with a smile on his face,
north prepared to board
the final plane home.
Where do you think you're going?
I'm going home.
Not on this plane.
Why not?
It says here you're dead.
But I'm not.
How can I be sure?
I'm here talking to you.
I know. That scares me.
I don't scare easily.
Imagine how it will affect the other passengers.
But I'm not dead.
Sorry. I can't take that chance.
Hey, it's north. He's alive.
What's he doing here?
This plane's headed to his hometown.
He's trying to reach his parents.
It'll ruin everything.
Let's get him!
Hey!
He's going up that way!
Stop him! Stop him!
Get that traitor!
Hey, kid, hop in.
What are you, some kind of guardian angel?
Well, I guess you can say that
'cause we at federal express feel we are guardians... guardians of your most important packages and priority communiques.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Just get me home, will you?
Well, if you absolutely positively have to be home by tomorrow morning, you've come to the right truck.
Man, you don't let up for a second.
I have no idea what you mean.
I have no idea what you mean.
Just tell me what to do.
Get in.
Federal express, huh?
O.K. Thanks.
Oh, Al.
Can I have a word with you?
Oh. Sure, boss.
Remember when you told me north was dead?
Yeah.
Uh, just curious... what'd you base that on?
I can only assume that you think this is blood, and if I had an I.Q. Below
24, I might think the same, but the stain in this cap comes from borscht.
Borscht?
Yes, borscht... a beef-based soup,
Russian in origin, most frequently served chilled with a dollop of sour cream.
I make a good borscht.
And I'd love to sample it someday, but the point I'm making here is that unless north's head was filled with this traditional slavic delicacy, he's not dead, you idiot!
Oh, no!
Not now, Arthur.
All right. This just calls for a slight change in plans.
I'll take it from here.
All right.
Sign on the fourth line.
What time is it?
Normally my answer would be no later than 10:30, but thanks to that jackknifed truck,
I'm sorry to say it's 10 of 12:00.
We'll be happy to refund your... no, that's o.K.
Mom! Dad!
I'm home!
Mom!
Where are you guys?
Mom? Dad?
Mom?
Mom?
Hello, north. Happy labor day.
I trust your summer was enjoyable.
Where are my folks?
Oh, they're in a safe place.
Where the hell are my parents?
North! Did you say the word hell?
The summer's really broadened you.
Winchell, I've got exactly 10 minutes to find my parents.
If you don't tell me where they are,
I'll show you how broadened I've become, you little asshole!
Why are you smiling?
I was thinking what a beautiful heartwarming scene it's going to be when you're reunited with your parents at your secret spot.
How do you know about my secret spot?
I'm a journalist, north.
It's my job to know about these things, and as much as I'm enjoying this chat, shouldn't you be on your way?
After all, you're down to... Nine minutes.
Where is he?
Winchell said he'd be here by now.
Don't worry, honey.
He'll be here soon.
Soon may not be good enough.
I've been sent here by the court to ensure that your son's physically in your arms by 12:00 noon.
How much time is left?
Six minutes.
And that's my own clock from my own house.
Uh!
Maybe we should go look for him.
No, no, honey.
What if we leave here and north shows up?
Relax, honey.
Winchell's a man of his word.
Hey, watch yourself, kid.
He has less than one minute.
You wait here.
I'll look for him.
Bad idea. The ruling stipulates north's supposed to be in the arms of both parents.
That's two parents and four arms.
If one of you leaves... the math speaks for itself.
Mom! Dad!
North!
Aah!
Hey.
You still here?
Yeah.
I must've fallen asleep.
Come on. I'll give you a ride home.
And then you were a beach bum.
Then you drove a sleigh.
Then you were a comedian who said my parents were the best for me.
I said that? I must be a pretty smart guy.
What's that?
Oh, nothing.
Just something I've always had, you know, for good luck.
Maybe good luck for you.
I bet that eagle's whistling a different tune.
Here we go.
35 maple drive.
Thanks a lot, mister.
Don't mention it, kid.
And remember, be it ever so humble, there's no place like home.
With the possible exception of Vegas when Sinatra's in town. Bye.
North!
North!
Mom! Dad!
Where were you?
We were worried sick.
I fell asleep in the mall.
We called the hospitals.
We called the police.
Oh, we looked everywhere.
You did?
Of course we did.
We love you so much, north.
If anything ever happened to you,
I don't know what we'd do.
I love you guys, too.
Come on.
You hungry, honey?
A little bit.
A little bit?
O.K., a lot.
O.K. You run upstairs, put on your pajamas, we'll bring something up for you.
A Kaijyu Theatre Picture
Shinya Tsukamoto's Film
Starring Tomoroh Taguchi
Persistent, aren't you?
Why do you keep following me?
What are you playing at?
Get lost.
What's the matter?
Hey, what's the matter?
Sleepy, Minori?
Daddy had a dream...
I was in an open space with my family.
I was a child again.
- With your foster parents?
- No.
- Did you remember?
- No.
But it was...
...a wonderful dream.
So peaceful too.
Sorry.
I remember being adopted at eight.
I've no memories before that.
Strange, isn't it?
Your new parents told you nothing?
There aren't even any photo's.
How old were you in your dream?
Excuse me.
Minori!
There he is!
Somebody stop them.
Shall I let you go?
Please don't.
I beg you, please don't.
And him too?
Damn you.
Bye- .
I'll kill you.
You really bug me.
Hey!
Coming for a swim?
You need to get strong.
Shall we go home, since you're so worried about the plants?
He did it.
That tune...
That woman in my dream...
It must have been my mother who sang it.
Very quietly.
Hello.
How did the training go?
Go and look for Minori.
- Please leave us alone.
- He's not here.
You shouldn't leave the back door unlocked.
Stay here.
Where's Minori?
I dropped him.
I'll kill you.
Now I remember...
Something...
Something's going to be destroyed.
What kind of guy did you pick?
To avoid accidents...
...he's a mild specimen.
Let's start.
From inside the man's brain... select a really calm image.
Watch as I manipulate it.
Continue.
- Stop.
- Continue.
Enough.
Return to the first image.
Fantastic.
The will to kill.
That's what counts.
Sacrifice him.
We'll give him an oxide shot.
He'll...
...corrode away.
This is the fruit of his cells and my brains.
Who'll be the first to test it?
Why don't you volunteer?
You'd do.
- Let's make ourselves some money.
- I don't want money.
Destruction is all I need.
Well done.
We've been together a long time.
Give everyone a shot.
With this...
The strength of the will to kill decides.
Killing him will be simple.
You'll be blown to pieces like your brat.
I'm going to do the same to you as I did to your brat.
What the hell's going on?
God...
He was truly... a god.
Who?
The man who can make us all gods.
He's a fiend.
So it wasn't because of...
It's dangerous here.
Let's leave.
You...
What are you?
I don't know, any more than you.
It's true. Believe me.
Please save me, Kana.
I'm scared.
Please save me.
Minori!
Minori!
Minori!
You laughed.
You laughed then.
You'll laugh when I'm killed.
Now I'm really angry!
He doesn't seem to care much for you.
The old fool didn't design this gun very well.
But why...?
How is he different?
He used will-power to transform himself.
When he was a kid...
he was strange.
Even when he was bullied... he never fought back.
He always bowed and scraped.
But one day, someone snatched some gladioli bulbs he treasured.
Straight away... he beat all the other kids up.
Most of them died.
And his beloved gladioli bulbs were crushed too.
Your husband's name is
Tomoo Taniguchi? Right?
Who are you?
Trust me to come across him.
He really is a devil.
Tell me what happened to him.
Please.
Where's Kana?
We're holding her.
Kill me and she dies.
Inject this or she dies.
Choose.
She'll die.
- Where's Kana?
- You don't care if she dies?
He hasn't changed at all.
Hostages don't seem to mean anything.
Taniguchi.
Tomoo Taniguchi.
You were always like that.
Losing what you loved.
Please, tell me.
What happened to him?
Happy birthday to you.
Take a good look.
Take a good look.
No!
Happy birthday to you.
Rust and die!
I'll inject you.
Rust and die.
Take a good look.
Look what I'm going to do.
It's magic.
Good.
Now nobody can beat you.
Abracadabra.
Good. When your will and the gun's are as one... you'll be able to kill the dog.
You will help me, won't you?
Your father is the only one in the world who can make the human weapon.
When they see you, important people will believe me.
Don't let him remember.
Take a good look.
I made it.
Don't.
After that, my big brother lost his memory.
Was it sadness at losing our mother?
I don't think he felt sorry he'd killed our parents.
He felt...
the beauty in destruction.
That scared him and he lost his memory.
I understand that better than anyone.
The strength of his will to kill always beat mine.
My only weapon is my arm.
He's not scared of anything now.
You feel the beauty in destruction.
So go ahead, destroy.
Destroy the greatest thing of all.
Pick that up.
Inject my body with it.
Quickly...Kana!
It's so peaceful.

I busied myself to think of a story...
...which would speak to the mysterious fears of our nature...
...and awaken thrilling horror.
One to make the reader dread to look around.
To curdle the blood, and quicken the beatings of the heart.
Tell the captain, we've got to take in the topsail.
She's going to rip!
Please, captain!
We have to drop the sails!
All hands to the mast!
Take the wheel! Come on!
Captain, we've hit the ice!
We've hit the ice!
Iceberg ahead!
Hard to starboard!
Go back!
Help! Help!
-Help!
-Hold on, Vernon!
Hold on!
Put your backs into it, men!
Let's go!
Captain, this is useless.
The ice stretches for miles.
What do you suggest we do?
Lay down and die?
The men are exhausted, sir.
They can't go on, man.
I tell you, I have not come this far to give up now.
They knew the risk when they signed on.
And we are gonna chop our way to the North Pole if we have to.
Then you run the risk of mutiny, captain.
-Did you say mutiny?
-Yes I did, sir.
We proceed north as planned.
At the cost of how many more lives?
As many as it takes!
There's something out there.
What is it?
What the hell is that?
Who is your captain?
I am.
Who the devil are you?
I've no time to talk.
You bring your men and your weapons and follow me.
-Now!
-Stay where you are.
I give the orders here.
Get the dogs! Get them!
Leave them.
They're already dead.
Get back to the ship now!
Everybody back to the ship!
Bears don't kill like that, nothing does.
Maybe it wants the man with the captain.
-Or it wants the captain.
-The devil's come for the captain.
For the last time, I made my way from
St. Petersburg to Archangel on foot.
From there I took a whaling ship north.
When we hit the ice, I used the dogs.
What's out there?
Listen to me. I have spent six years planning this, my entire fortune.
I will not be stopped by you or some phantom.
Do you share my madness?
-No, not madness.
-What, then?
There's a passage to the North Pole, and I will find it.
At the cost of your own life?
The lives of your crew?
Lives come and go.
If we succeed, our names will live on forever.
I will be hailed as the benefactor of our species.
You're wrong.
I, of all men, know that.
Who are you?
My name...
...is Victor...
...Frankenstein.
Mother!
Oh, my wonderful son Victor!
You are the handsomest, kindest, cleverest...
...most wonderfulest boy in the whole world!
Madam! You will spoil the boy, really.
Would you two leave us, please,
Mrs. Moritz?
Doctor.
Come along, Justine.
Victor, this is Elizabeth.
She's coming to live with us.
She's lost both her mother and father to the scarlet fever, Victor.
She's an orphan now.
You must think of her as your own sister.
You must look after her, and be kind to her.
Always.
Mother, oh.
How is the imminent arrival?
Oh, a little frisky today.
When you were a little boy, you used to chase fireflies in the field.
Yes, and when I trapped them in my jar, they died.
-And do you remember how you cried?
-Yes.
Because you wanted to keep them glowing by your bedside...
...to light you as you read.
You were so hungry for knowledge.
Such a serious little boy.
You've become such an earnest young man.
All these strange and ancient books.
You'll be an even greater doctor than your father.
But you know, Victor, life shouldn't be all study.
There's such fun to be had.
-Give me that back.
-No.
Give me that back, Mother.
Change partners. And twirl!
-Now, Caroline.
-You're right.
-You mustn't exert yourself. Please.
-I know.
Don't worry, madam. Your new baby will be a natural dancer.
Excellent.
You'll be the envy of all the young ladies and gentlemen.
Justine.
Justine, may I have this dance?
-Madam!
-Hurry!
You must make a decision!
How can I?
The baby's in the wrong position.
I can't proceed.... I can't....
Cut me. Save the baby.
She'll be all right.
Your father's the finest doctor in Geneva.
Father?
Father?
Father, how is she?
I did everything I could....
Everything I could....
Mother? Mother!
Bring her back.
Please, bring her back.
No!
Please, bring her back.
Oh, Mother.
You should never have died.
No one need ever die.
I will stop this.
I will stop this.
I promise.
Victor, you're completely obsessed.
Please explain what that is.
It's energy. It never disappears, it merely changes form.
It's possible to convert this candle wax...
...into the convulsions of a mechanical dog.
But the applications of this are limitless. Really.
Oh, please come outside, Victor.
It's such a beautiful day.
Go away, I'm busy.
What's this?
It's for spraying down the electric eels.
Now, put it down. Put it down.
It's not for playing with.
It's not for playing with. Put it down, put it down-- Don't do that.
I warned you. Don't-- Don't--
Give me that, you little....
Come on!
Come on!
We should be grateful to Victor...
...for abandoning his experiments for one afternoon.
Well, who says I have?
What do you mean?
Look!
We're all going to die.
-You knew this would happen.
-Not for certain.
But I had hoped the conditions would be right. They're common here.
I've never seen one quite as large, though. Look.
-Isn't it wonderful?
-Victor, you shouldn't have done this.
It's all right, it's all right.
-We must take cover. A tree!
-That's exactly the wrong thing to do.
It's a much larger conductor than we are.
Victor, what about Willie?
-What are we to do?
-Come on.
Spread out.
Elizabeth, take this. Now, quickly.
-Come on, quickly!
-What is that?
Dig it right into the ground. Go ahead.
-Now what?
-Justine, take this. Come on.
-Willie!
-Everyone down.
Give me your hands. It'll be fine.
Now take him. Now, that's good.
I hope you know what you're doing.
-Willie? Willie, don't look up!
-Willie.
-Victor--
-Wait!
One, two, three....
Now.
So how do you feel, Elizabeth?
Alive.
Ladies and gentlemen, dear friends.
Gather round and listen.
As you probably know, tomorrow my dear son Victor...
...leaves me to pursue, what I'm sure...
...will be an illustrious career in a profession...
...I am not altogether unassociated with.
Oh, modesty.
My one regret is that his mother...
...my late wife, is not here...
...to share the pride...
...which our son fills me with tonight.
Yes.
She wanted you to have this, Victor.
On your graduation.
And in it she has written:
"This is the journal of Victor Frankenstein."
The rest of the leaves are blank...
...to be filled with the deeds of a noble life.
We'd better go in, before they miss us.
Just a little while longer. Please.
I don't know when we'll be alone together again.
Oh, dear Victor.
I shall miss you laughing at me.
I'll miss you making me laugh.
So how do brothers and sisters say goodbye?
Perhaps they never have to.
I won't, if you won't.
Are you my sister?
Sister...
...friend...
...lover.
Wife?
Yes.
Then come with me to Ingolstadt.
Marry me now.
-Victor, no.
-Well, then I'll stay.
I want more than anything else in the world to be your wife.
But as long as you're away,
I belong here.
I want to make this house live again.
I want to make this a great home for our children.
And now you must go, and do the great things you need to do.
I want you so much.
I'll be here when you return.
Each holiday. Every visit.
Then on our wedding night.
Until our wedding night.
Lots of stairs, I'm afraid.
-How was your journey?
-Good, thanks. I made good progress...
-...over the mountains.
-I am pleased.
-As I said, we've only got attic space.
-It's exactly what I'm looking for.
But Frau Brach, there will be a great deal...
...of scientific equipment and rigging to be delivered.
Every day, for the next week.
I trust you have no objections.
I'm sure you appreciate the need for a proper laboratory.
Oh, Putzi likes you.
This will be perfect.
"The foolish and vain force their views by the rod.
But knowledge is power only through God."
Our motto. Easily forgotten by you young men in a hurry.
But perhaps the greatest mistake that all students make...
...during their time here, is to suppose...
...that they can ever have an original or creative thought.
We have all imagined that in our time.
But gentlemen, you have not come here in order to think for yourselves.
You are here to learn how to think for your patients.
You must learn, therefore, in the first place...
...to submit yourselves...
...to the established laws of physical reality.
But surely, professor...
...you don't intend we disregard more philosophical approaches?
Philosophical?
Those which stir the imagination as well as the intellect, as in Paracelsus.
Paracelsus.
An arrogant and foolish Swiss.
Albertus Magnus?
His nonsense was exploded
500 years ago.
Cornelius Agrippa?
A sorcerer. An occultist.
What is your name?
Victor Frankenstein, sir. Of Geneva.
Another Swiss.
Mr. Frankenstein, here at the University of Ingolstadt, we teach--
And indeed, hope to advance.
--the science of medicine.
Chemistry, biology, physics.
We study hard science.
Surely, the greatest possible advances lie in combining these things.
We do not study the ravings of lunatics and alchemists...
...hundreds of years in their graves...
...because their kind of amateur, fanatical, fantastical speculation...
...does not heal bodies or save lives.
Only science can do that.
Now, have we your permission to continue?
-Nice coat.
-Why, thank you.
Don't take it too hard.
Krempe doesn't approve of public humiliation.
-I am not mad!
-My dear fellow, of course you're not.
In fact, that's just what I'd expect a perfectly rational person...
...to say to a complete stranger.
Henry Clerval, by the way, and I'm completely crazy.
-Victor Frankenstein.
-Of Geneva.
-Of Geneva.
-Yes, I noti--
Why don't you look where I'm going?
That's Schiller.
Ornament of the playing field.
-Really.
-He's new as well.
You can tell because he goes around looking at things with his mouth open.
What are you here for?
-Research.
-Very grand.
I'm here to become a mere doctor.
I'm told it has something to do with healing the sick.
Which is a pity, really, because
I find sick people rather revolting.
Still, I'll have a good time, get my degree--
If I can stop failing Anatomy.
--and settle down to relieve rich old ladies of their imaginary ailments...
...and then relieve their very real and beautiful daughters.
-Who was that? He was at the lecture.
-That's Waldman.
-That's Waldman.
-Yes.
Interesting case.
They say in his youth...
...he could break into heaven and lecture God on science.
Ran into trouble with the authorities years back.
Something to do with illegal experiments.
But what kind of experiments,
I wonder?
So what was it you were saying?
Rich old ladies and their daughters?
Yes, it's a life of sacrifice, I know, but someone's got to do it.
And that is why the central nervous system...
...and its crowning achievement, the brain...
...are as complicated and mysterious a set of organs...
...as you are ever likely to encounter.
Mr. Frankenstein, the incision is yours.
Excellent.
Mr. Clerval, you may remove the cranial lid.
"Henry, now fully recovered, continues his struggle to pass Anatomy."
I was always terrible at anatomy.
"Professor Waldman is very tolerant of us. I'm learning a great deal."
-Professor Waldman is remarkable.
-And so is Henry.
"God bless you, all my love, Victor."
-That's very nice.
-"P.S. I've fallen in love."
I beg your pardon?
"She's dark, sleek, and beautiful...
...and always wags her tail whenever she sees me.
Her name is Putzi, and she's the friendliest sheepdog that I've known."
"P.S. Elizabeth,
I dream of how your hair shines...."
"Of how your lips taste.
I dream of your arms and breasts...
...and of the time on our wedding night...
...when we will be alone together at last."
What else does it say?
It says, "I'm working very hard to make lots of new friends."
More coffee, anyone?
Once and for all, Frankenstein!
Life is life, death is death.
These things are real.
-They are absolute.
-That is rubbish and you know it!
That premise has been repeatedly challenged by your own staff!
Yes, you, sir! We don't know where life ends or death begins.
Hair continues to grow after what we choose to call death. So do fingernails.
We know that a man's brain may die...
...but his heart and lungs may continue to pump and breathe.
Now, you know that.
Mr. Frankenstein of Geneva,
I warn you...
...what you are suggesting is not only illegal, it is immoral.
Rubbish!
"Dear diary, why does no one understand me? P.S. I am not mad."
You.
-Explain yourself.
-Professor, I'm sorry.
Listen, I came here to learn all about the new science.
About galvanism,
Franklin's experiments.
Combination of modern disciplines with ancient knowledge...
-...to protect and create--
-To create what?
Sir, we can change things. We can make things better. You know that.
We are on the verge of undreamed-of discoveries...
...if we only have the courage to ask the right questions. You must help me.
Come on.
-Victor....
-Come on.
Henry.
Lock the door.
Now, for thousands of years...
...the Chinese have based their medical science on the belief...
...that the human body is a chemical engine run by energy streams.
-Fascinating. How do they explain--?
-Don't touch that!
Their doctors treat patients...
...by inserting needles like these into the flesh...
...at various key points, to manipulate these electric streams.
I see.
So electricity is the key.
Now, look at this.
Go on, touch it.
-It feels warm.
-It is.
Yes. How do you do?
Turn it off!
-I can't, it's not working.
-Try to stay calm, Henry.
Simply a matter of reducing the polarity.
A monkey's arm is basically the same as ours.
-No arm is this strong!
-Now, this must work.
Let me help you, professor.
You shall, of course, tell no one.
They wouldn't believe you anyway.
Dearest Victor.
Nothing much changes here.
Mrs. Moritz continues to love and torment Justine, in equal measure.
Willie grows more precocious every day...
...and Father almost expires with pride...
...at the very thought of you and your work.
And I....
Well, I just miss you, very much.
Please write soon, Victor.
No, I'm serious.
You take vaccine, for instance.
Thirty years ago the entire concept of vaccine was unheard of...
...and now we save lives every day.
-But that isn't the whole answer.
-What do you mean?
That sooner or later the best way to cheat death will be to create life.
Now you've gone too far.
-There's only one God, Victor.
-No, leave God out of it.
If you loved someone, they had a sick heart...
...wouldn't you give them a healthy one? It's not impossible.
We can do it, we're steps away.
If we can replace one part of a human, we can replace every part.
And if we do that, we can design a life.
We can create a being that will not grow old or sicken.
One that's stronger than us, better than us.
One more intelligent than us, more civilized than us.
-In our lifetime?
-No.
How close did you get, professor?
Too close.
Professor, I beg you, let me see these notes.
No. My work now, and its application...
...lies exclusively in the preservation of life.
I abandoned my other researches many years ago.
Why?
Because they resulted in abomination.
You're not sticking that in me.
It's got a pox in it, I hear.
-Pox? They've given us pox?
-Pox.
It's not pox, it's a vaccine that will prevent plague in this city.
-What's that?
-It's a tiny, harmless amount...
-...of anti-smallpox serum.
-You just said pox!
I said it was harmless.
It's a necessary precaution, without which this godforsaken city...
...would be immediately put under quarantine.
You doctors kill. I don't care what you say. You're not sticking that in me.
Yes, I am. It's the law!
-Sit him down, someone.
-You're not sticking that in me!
You're not sticking that in me!
-Sir?
-Professor? Sir?
Find him!
Come on! Come on! Come on!
It's no use, Victor, he's gone.
-No! No, Henry!
-Let him go!
-No! No, this shouldn't happen!
-Let him go! Victor, stop!
-It shouldn't happen!
-Stop!
It need not happen!
The hell with you!
Whatever you say, whatever you call it, you doctors are killers.
You murder people!
Evil! You're evil!
Evil!
You're the ones that deserve to die.
God will punish you. He'll punish you!
God will punish you!
My God, you were so close!
Of course, the power!
The materials were wrong.
You needed auxiliary sources.
"The experiment a failure.
Resulting reanimant malformed and hideous to behold.
This factor dependant on the appropriate raw materials."
Raw materials....
-Come on, Henry.
-I can't help you, Victor.
-You won't. What are you afraid of?
-Everything! What if the authorities--?
We'll do this in secret. I've got the raw materials, I've got Waldman's journals.
-You stole his journals?
-We owe it to him to complete this.
-He was one step away.
-He never wanted this.
Couldn't face it, that's different.
Even if it were possible, and even if you had the right--
Which you don't.
--to make this decision for us...
...can you imagine there wouldn't be a terrible price to pay?
I think for the chance to defeat death and disease...
...to let everyone on Earth have the chance at life...
...sustained, healthy life...
...to allow people who love each other to be together forever....
For all of that,
I think it's a risk worth taking.
Please, Justine, just leave me alone.
I won't talk about it.
But all these letters, you read them to us every week.
I wrote them. I wrote the letters.
He hasn't written to me in months.
Elizabeth....
Something horrific is happening to him. I can feel it.
At first I wasn't sure, but I knew I had to hide it from Father.
Now there are rumors of cholera.
I can look after Father and Willie.
You go to Ingolstadt--
That's not possible. He won't want me.
He's probably found someone else.
If he was mine,
I would have gone already.
But he isn't mine.
He's yours, and you must go to him.
Raw materials, that's all they are.
Tissue to be re-used.
The very finest brain.
-But they all died of cholera, sir.
-No matter.
Thank you.
The assembled organs must have the appropriate nutrients and heat...
...and crucially, more direct power.
More direct power.
Amniotic fluid is the chief biogenic element.
The subject is injected with this.
The copper acupuncture needles...
...are inserted at key energy points.
Now, after the removal of current, the dead toad should retain animation.
But independently of external power sources.
Yes.
That's it.
That's the combination.
That's the combination!
That's it!
Victor? Victor!
Victor, open the door!
-Victor, please!
-What do you want?
There's cholera. It's an epidemic!
The city's been placed under martial law.
-Are you listening to me, Victor?
-Yes. And?
The militia's arriving to quarantine the city.
Most of us are getting out while we still can.
Krempe knows you're here.
What if he tells the authorities?
Goodbye, Henry.
Victor, it's me.
Elizabeth.
Can you hear me?
Victor, I have to see you.
-Go away.
-Please, Victor!
I won't leave here until you see me.
Come in the side door.
Alone!
What's happened to you?
How can you live here like this?
And that stench.
Don't go in there!
-We have to leave. It isn't safe.
-No, I have to stay.
-Even if it means you'll die?
-Yes.
Well, let me help you.
No, that's impossible.
We made a promise.
Victor, I beg you.
Look, I know that this is difficult for you to understand...
...but I cannot abandon this work now.
It is too important. Not just for me, but, believe me, for everyone.
And it must come first.
Before us?
Elizabeth...
...I love you so much, but....
Goodbye.
Elizabeth! Elizabeth!
Oh, God! Elizabeth!
Elizabeth!
Live! Live! Live!
Live!
Yes!
No....
No!
No!
No!
No!
It's alive.
It's alive.
No.
What have I done?
What have I done?
"Massive birth defects.
Greatly enhanced physical strength.
But resulting reanimant...
...is malfunctional...
...and pitiful...
...and dead."
Tomorrow this journal and its secrets must be destroyed...
...forever.
Oh, God.
No!
You fool,
Victor Frankenstein of Geneva.
How could you know what you'd unleashed?
How is it pieced together?
Bits of thieves, bits of murderers....
Evil stitched to evil stitched to evil.
Do you really believe this thing will thank you for its monstrous birth?
Evil will have its revenge.
God help your loved ones.
What do you think you're doing?
He's got cholera! He's the one who's been spreading the plague!
Get him!
Come here, you--
Keep away from him.
No, kill him now!
He went this way.
There now. Easy. Easy. Just a bit.
-That's it. There, now, rest easy.
-Henry, you're here.
Of course I'm here.
It was touch and go with you, though.
I feared cholera, turned out to be pneumonia.
Yes, I'm becoming something of a doctor.
Even Krempe seems pleased with me.
At this rate,
I might even pass Anatomy.
-The epidemic?
-Dreadful.
There's nothing we can do for them.
The vulnerable, anyone who's without shelter or food...
...the newborns, especially, will die.
-Are you sure?
-I'm certain of it.
Thank God.
What do you mean?
Nothing.
Well then, that's my shift finished.
I'll see you later.
Elizabeth.
Elizabeth.
-Please, please, forgive me!
-Of course I do.
Victor, I don't know what you're working on, and I don't want to know.
But it nearly killed you.
It's over, it's finished.
It should never have started.
It's dead! It's dead.
-Felix!
-Yes?
Don't forget the onion scraps.
All right, I've got them.
Go on, get.
Come on. Come on.
Go on, go on. Go on. Get.
-How are the pigs?
-Happy they've been fed.
-How are your hands?
-They're bleeding again.
Let me see them.
That's better.
There.
-The soup's ready.
-Come on, Grandpa. Sit down.
Thank you.
We'll never get through the winter with this yield.
-The ground's frozen hard.
-We'll sell another pig at market.
We can't.
Not until they lift the quarantine.
Even then, it's one less for us. Last month's rent, he'll be back for that.
Come on. We'll do this together.
You're right.
We've got to, before the snow comes.
Come on, then.
The ground's frozen solid. We'd need
20 men to do this. It's useless!
-It's getting late.
-We don't have enough to eat.
We'll manage. Let's go.
Look. Look.
They must be gifts from the Good Spirit of the Forest.
Father, nothing in this life comes free of cost.
-I would like to know who and why.
-Was it the Good Spirit, Grandpa?
-I believe it was.
-Don't fill their head with nonsense.
Who's there?
Felix? Children?
Right.
What's this one?
-Friend?
-Friend! Well done!
That's very good.
You've got lots of friends, haven't you? Grandpa and....
Friend....
Friend....
Friend.
Friend.
Family.
Father.
You must travel with them for the entire journey.
This equipment must not be left unattended.
My father will take delivery of them in Geneva. Understand?
I do, sir.
-Going somewhere?
-Henry, look.
Look at this locket Victor gave me.
Isn’t it beautiful?
-Yes, it's lovely. Is this really you?
-Yes, it's a bad likeness, I know.
But for now, it will serve instead of a ring.
Congratulations on the entirely expected!
-When?
-As soon as we get home.
We'll be there for New Year's Eve.
-He's taking over Father's practice.
-And expanding it.
I'm going on ahead now the quarantine's lifted. So much to do.
Now, the practice needs a partner.
Now, there's not much money...
...but there is food and board and some very good company.
And it's the ideal position for someone who has finally passed Anatomy.
So we were wondering if...
...there was anybody that you could recommend?
Victor, I-- I don't know what to say.
Well, please say yes.
-Yes.
-Yes!
-Yes!
-Yes, yes!
And you can write that down in your journal!
"This is...
...the journal...
...of...
...Victor...
...Frankenstein...
...of...
...Geneva."
Come on, quickly.
Come on, then, off you go.
Quickly, now.
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.
Come on, now. Come on.
Time for bed.
In you go.
"For the Good Spirit of the Forest."
Are you the Good Spirit of the Forest?
Not exactly. Where's your father?
I said, where's your father?
Who's there? Maggie?
-No.
-Oh, it's you.
-What have you done to Maggie?
-Is he in there?
Hiding behind a blind old man?
Get away! Get away!
Don't blame me.
Blame your son for not paying his rent on time.
My God.
Thank you, my friend.
Thank you so much.
Won't you come and sit by the fire?
Please, don't be afraid.
Come. Come in.
Have a rest, sit down.
That's better.
I'm glad you finally came in.
A man shouldn't have to hide in the shadows.
Better that way, for me.
Why?
People are afraid.
Except you.
It can't be as bad as that.
Worse.
I can "see" you with my hands, if you'll trust me.
-Papa, Papa, he hurt Grandpa!
-Who hurt Grandpa?
-What was that noise?
-Tell me what the noise was.
What happened, Maggie?
Poor man.
Have you no friends?
There are some people.
But they don't know me.
Why do you not go to them?
Because I am so very...
...ugly.
And they are so very...
...beautiful.
Father! Get out of here!
-Get out of here, monster.
-Leave him alone!
We have to leave here.
No.
I will have revenge!
Frankenstein!
Geneva.
-Quickly, quickly.
-She's here, she's here!
-Willie!
-We got your letter!
It's the first one
I was allowed to read.
Congratulations, Elizabeth.
-I'm happy for you.
-Thank you, Justine.
Oh, is that the locket?
Look how handsome Victor is.
-Can I take this to show Peter?
-Yes, but, Willie, it's not a toy.
Let him go.
Don't dawdle, William!
Justine, you idiot. Pay attention.
Anyone would think you're the one that's getting married.
-Yes, Mother.
-What's wrong?
Nothing. Really.
Just leave it. You've ruined it now.
No! No!
Frankenstein.
You, with me.
-Have you seen Willie?
-Isn’t he back yet?
Claude went to find if he'd lost track of time.
-They say he never arrived.
-Far too late for him to still be out.
-William!
-William!
-William!
-William!
Willie!
Willie!
Willie....
Willie!
This isn't a game!
Willie!
It's so late.
We're all so tired. I'm so tired.
Father! I'm so pleased to see you.
What's wrong?
William!
We checked the east ridge.
There's nothing there.
Damn!
Elizabeth?
I found him!
I found him!
Elizabeth!
No!
We did everything we could, sir.
You just rest easy now.
We did everything we could.
Sir, I'm terrified for my girl.
She's still out looking for William.
We parted badly. I was cruel to her.
I didn't mean it.
I think she finds it hard, with your wedding. She loves you dearly.
I couldn't bear it if anything happened to her.
She's all I've got. Please, help me!
We'll organize another search now that it's light.
We will find her, Mrs. Moritz,
I promise.
-How is Father?
-His heart is breaking.
Mr. Frankenstein...
...we've apprehended the murderer, five miles from here hiding in a barn.
We found this on her.
It's yours, I believe, sir?
Sir, you must come immediately.
The townspeople have gone mad.
-What are they doing?
-They must have broken into the jail!
For God's sake, can't you stop them?
They've gone wild!
This is a lynching mob!
Stop! This is unlawful.
-Justine.
-Justine!
Victor! Help me!
I was trying to find him!
I went to the lake, but it was dark!
I wanted to bring him to you!
He must be there for the wedding!
I'm sorry! He's so tiny.
We managed to close the gates on the mob, Claude.
What about Justine?
We've cut her down.
We can bury her in the morning.
Thank you, Claude. Get to bed.
The sea of ice.
I will meet you there...
...on the sea of ice.
Oh, Justine, forgive me.
Victor, tell me. Who is this man?
How do you know he's responsible?
I'll tell you everything after I destroy him.
This is a matter for the police.
They wouldn't understand.
Well, neither do I.
Then just accept it.
Get up.
Get up.
You do speak.
Yes, I speak.
And read.
And think.
And know the ways of man.
How did you find me?
Your journal.
Then you mean to kill me.
No.
You murdered my brother, didn't you?
I took him by the throat with one hand...
...lifted him off the ground...
...and slowly crushed his neck.
And as I killed him,
I saw your face.
You gave me these emotions. But you didn't tell me how to use them.
Now two people are dead...
...because of us.
Why?
There's something at work in my soul which I do not understand.
What of my soul? Do I have one?
Or was that a part you left out?
Who were these people of which I am comprised?
Good people? Bad people?
-Materials, nothing more.
-You're wrong.
Do you know
I knew how to play this?
In which part of me did this knowledge reside?
In these hands?
In this mind? In this heart?
And reading and speaking.
Not things learned, so much as things remembered.
Trace memories in the brain, perhaps.
Did you ever consider the consequences of your actions?
You gave me life, and then you left me to die.
Who am I?
You....
I don't know.
And you think I'm evil.
What can I do?
There is something I want. A friend.
A friend?
Companion.
A female.
Someone like me.
So she won't hate me.
Like you?
Oh, God, you don't know what you're asking.
I do know that...
...for the sympathy of one living being...
...I would make peace with all.
I have love in me the likes of which...
...you can scarcely imagine.
And rage, the likes of which you would not believe.
If I cannot satisfy the one...
...I will indulge the other.
And if I consent, how will you live?
We would travel north, my bride and I...
...to the furthest reaches of the Pole.
Where no man has ever set foot.
There, we would live out our lives...
...together.
No human eye would ever see us again.
This, I vow.
You must help me. Please.
If it is possible to right this wrong...
...then I will do it.
-Victor!
-Victor.
Are you all right?
-Yes, I'm safe. I'm safe.
-What happened?
Tell us.
Victor.
Victor, you have to tell us what happened!
One month, that's all I ask.
And then we can be married and we can forget this whole business.
-I promise.
-Promise? Promise.
Oh, don't dare use that word to me.
You promised to tell me who this man was. You promised to stop this work.
-Your promises mean nothing.
-Elizabeth.
-I have to leave this house.
-Where will you go?
-Somewhere I can recover.
-This is ridiculous.
I haven't got time to argue.
Oh, isn't it convenient?
Or doesn't it fit in with your plans?
Don't you ever think of anyone or anything but yourself?
God forgive me.
Why her?
Materials, remember? Nothing more.
-Your words.
-No.
You will honor your promise to me!
I will not.
Go on, kill me now.
That is mild compared to what will come.
If you deny me my wedding night,
I will be with you on yours.
Elizabeth!
Elizabeth.
Wait. Wait, please wait. Please.
I have to speak to you. Please!
What do you want to say?
Don't go.
Please, don't go.
I'm frightened.
Of what?
I have done something so terrible...
...so evil.
And I'm frightened that if I tell you the truth...
...that I will lose you.
You'll lose me if you don't.
I...
...don't know...
...what...
...to do.
Will you marry me, Victor?
Marry me today.
Tomorrow, tell me everything.
But you must tell me the truth.
And together, we can face anything.
Whatever you've done, whatever has happened...
...I love you.
To share the truth, the whole truth, for good or ill...
...to stand by each other in sickness and in health...
...and in joy, from this day forward...
...till death do you part.
Who is this man, sir?
-How shall we know him?
-Believe me, you'll know him.
He killed Master William, and Justine Moritz died for it.
No hesitation, lads.
Shoot the bastard on sight!
Henry?
Don't worry about a thing.
You two look after each other.
I'll look after your father.
I'm sorry, sir. The last ferry's gone.
There's nothing now till morning.
-Damn.
-I'll secure you lodgings for the night.
-Thank you, Claude.
-Come on.
-Keep your pistols dry!
-They're dry enough.
And if they fail, we've others.
And if those fail...
...we can always gut the bastard.
-Go to your post.
-Yes, sir.
Don't worry, sir.
You're well guarded.
Now, why don't you go on upstairs to your wife?
It's not often a man has his wedding night.
You're soaking.
Brother and sister no more.
Now husband and wife.
Victor?
Lock the door.
-Lock the door.
-Victor.
I saw him in a flash of lightning.
He ran to the lake.
You two stay here.
We lost him.
Elizabeth!
Don't bother to scream.
Please.... Please don't hurt me.
You are lovelier than
I ever could have imagined.
Elizabeth!
Elizabeth!
I keep my promises!
For God's sake, tell me what happened.
No point. I know what I have to do.
God. No, Victor! You can't do this,
I won't let you!
She's gone. I love her.
What would you do?
Leave her in peace.
My father would have done this for my mother.
Your father's dead.
Then there's nothing left to lose.
Nothing but your soul.
Live!
No!
Live. Live.
Yes. Yes. Yes.
Say my name.
Please, say my name.
Remember! You must remember.
Elizabeth?
Elizabeth?
That's it.
That's it, you remember.
That's it.
Now, stand. Stand.
Yes. Yes. Yes.
You remember.
You remember.
She's beautiful.
She's not for you.
Come.
Elizabeth?
Say my name.
Elizabeth.
Yes.
Elizabeth!
You're beautiful.
Say my name.
Elizabeth, come to me.
Come to me.
Say my name, Elizabeth.
Vic....
That's right, Elizabeth.
Victor.
No, you're mine.
You're mine.
-Leave her alone! No!
-Get away from her. She's mine.
She's mine! She said my name!
She remembers!
She's mine!
No!
All that I once loved lies in a shallow grave...
...by my hand.
I followed the trail he left for me--
North.
Always north.
--for months now...
...with one intent:
To kill him.
Now...
...I'm tired.
I'm so very, very tired.
What did he say?
He's dead.
He died raving about some phantom.
What is it out there, captain?
He told me a story that...
...couldn't be true.
He was mad, I think.
A warming breeze.
-The ice will melt yet.
-And what then, captain?
-We head north.
-No.
Who are you?
He never gave me a name.
Why do you weep?
He was my father.
"And yea, I gave my heart to know wisdom...
...and to know madness and folly...
...and I perceived that all is vanity and vexation of spirit.
For in much wisdom is much grief...
...and he that increaseth knowledge, increaseth sorrow.
For God shall bring every work and every secret thing into judgment...
...whether it be good, or whether it be evil."
-Captain--
-He has a right to bear witness.
Jesus, it's breaking up!
Get back to the ship, captain.
Leave the damn torch! Leave it!
Come with us.
I am done with man.
Hang on, I've got you!
Help! Help!
Here, captain. Here, captain.
Quick, grab my hand!
Where to now, captain?
Home.
Claire.
I miss you.
Dr. Weir report te the Lewis & Clark in Docking Bay 4.
- Ion drive set.
- Thank you.
Heading: Vector One, nine degrees.
We are prepped for lockdown.
I can't believe it, this is ridiculous.
I haven't got more than my hand in the last six weeks, and now this shit.
I mean, why can't we go to Mars, Captain?
- I mean, Mars has got women.
- Smith's right.
Neptune, there's nothing out there.
Yeah, and if the shit goes down, we'll be on our own.
You know the rules, people.
Someone drops the ball, we get the call.
Now, let's go.
- Have you got our course plotted in?
- Yes, sir.
- Locked and cocked and ready to rock.
- Mr. Justin?
Everything's green on my screen,
Skipper.
Start your countdown now.
Ion drive will engage in T minus 10 minutes.
Thank you, Lieutenant.
Let's go.
- Smith, you follow me.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Justin, get those tanks prepped.
- Yes, sir.
- Mr. Cooper.
- Skipper.
- Ion drive in 10 minutes.
- It's time to play spam-in-the-can.
- Skipper.
- Peters.
Captain Miller,
I just wanted to say this is something...
Clock is ticking, Doctor.
You waiting for a personal invitation, there, Mr. Smith?
- No, sir.
- Captain, I don't want to take up...
Doctor, if you'll just follow the rest of the crew to the grav tanks, we're almost underway.
That bunk better be squared away,
Mr. Cooper, or you'll find yourself walking to Neptune.
What's the hold-up, Peters?
Just loading the last of the CO2 scrubbers, sir.
You stand right here.
Thanks, D.J.
- Hats off in the tank.
- Sir.
- First time in a grav couch?
- Yeah.
I think your captain has some kind of a problem with me.
Oh, well. Don't worry about him.
He just loves having complete strangers on his ship.
- D.J.
- Yeah.
No.
Is this necessary?
When the ion drive fires, you'll be taking about 30 G's.
Without a tank, the force would liquety your skeleton.
I've seen the effect on mice.
Claustrophobic?
Very.
Biiiy.
I'm so aione.
Hello?
Is anyone there?
Oh, God.
Biiiy?
I'm so coid.
Claire.
I'm waiting.
You're all right. Breathe. D.J.!
- Okay, Dr. Weir, let's get you up.
- Okay, I'm fine.
- Come on, take it easy.
- I'm fine.
Okay. There you go.
Now move nice and slow.
You've been in stasis for 56 days.
You're gonna experience a little disorientation, you understand?
- I'm all right now, thank you.
- Okay, take that. Don't rush it.
All yours.
You okay, Doc?
- Want some coffee?
- What?
Would you like some coffee?
No. Thank you.
All right, suit yourself.
What about you, Starck?
Would you like something hot and black inside you?
- Is that an offer?
- It is not.
- Then how about some coffee?
- Starck?
- Yes, sir.
- Why aren't you on the bridge?
Do you mind if I get dressed first?
As a matter of fact, Lieutenant,
I do mind if you get dressed first.
Let's go, people. We have a job to do.
Okay, Denny, here we go.
Happy birthday.
Piay horsey, Mommy. Piay horsey.
Hey, no more ball in the house.
You're the one who can't catch.
- Yo, apologize.
- Sorry about that, Mama Bear.
- All right.
- All right, then.
- Peters.
- Yes, sir.
I did try to find a replacement for you, but with such short notice, it was impossible.
I am sorry.
I talked to my ex.
He's going to take Denny for Christmas.
I'll get him for the summer, so everything's all right.
Smitty.
Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen, in approximately
2 hours and 23 minutes, we'll be arriving in the orbit of Neptune.
Thank you very much.
- I thank you.
- That's good.
All boards are green.
Everything's five by five.
- U.S.A.C. Been notified of our position?
- Yes, sir.
- All right, people, listen up.
- D.J.
As you all know, we have an addition to our crew.
Dr. Weir, you care to join us?
Introductions all around.
This is my XO, Lieutenant Starck.
Mr. Justin, Engineering.
The funky spaceman over here is Mr. Cooper.
What exactly is it you do on board this ship, Coop?
Listen up, Doc,
I'm your best friend, okay?
I am the lifesaver and the heartbreaker.
He's a rescue technician.
This is Peters, medical technician.
And my pilot, Mr. Smith.
The gloomy Gus in the corner over there, that's...
D.J. Trauma.
All right, all right.
Now we all know each other.
Skipper, I got a question.
What the fuck are we doing way out here?
Perhaps the good doctor will be kind enough to tell us.
Thank you.
First of all,
I want to say how much I appreciate
- this opportunity to join you on what I...
- It's for sure that you appreciate being here, Doctor, but you must understand that we don't.
We were taken off a well-deserved leave and sent into Neptune space.
We are now three billion klicks from the nearest outpost.
The last time U.S.A.C. Attempted a rescue this far past the outer reach, well, we lost both ships.
So, if you please...
Right. Well...
Everything I'm about to tell you is considered Code Black by the NSA.
U.S.A.C. Intercepted a radio transmission from a decaying orbit around Neptune.
The source of this transmission has been identified as the Event Horizon.
Yeah, well, that's bullshit, for starters.
- Skipper, you took me off leave...
- Thank you so much.
Smitty, sit down.
Cooper, as you were.
Let the man speak.
What was made public aboutthe Event Horizon, that she was a deep space research vessel, that her reactor went critical, and that the ship blew up, none of that is true.
The Event Horizon was the culmination of a secret government project to create a spacecraft capable of faster-than-light flight.
I don't... Excuse me.
See, you can't actually do that.
The law of relativity prohibits faster-than-light travel.
Relativity, yes.
We can't break the law of relativity.
We can go around it.
The ship doesn't really go faster than light.
What it does is it creates a dimensional gateway that allows it to jump instantaneously from one point of the universe to another light years away.
How?
- Well, it's difficult to... It's all math.
- Try us, Doctor.
Right, well, using layman's terms, we use a rotating magnetic field to focus a narrow beam of gravitons.
These in turn fold space-time, consistent with Weyl tensor dynamics, until the space-time curvature becomes infinitely large and you produce a singularity.
Now, the singularity...
Layman's terms.
Fuck layman's terms.
Do you speak English?
Imagine, for a minute, that this piece of paper...
Excuse me.
That's Vanessa, and that's mine.
Attractive piece of paper represents space-time and you want to get from point "A" here to "B" there.
Now, what's the shortest distance between two points?
A straight line.
Wrong.
The shortest distance between two points is zero.
And that's what the gateway does.
It folds space.
So that point "A" and point "B" co-exist in the same space and time.
When the spacecraft passes through the gateway, space returns to normal.
It's called a gravity drive.
- How do you know all this?
- I built it.
Well, I can see why they sent you.
So if the ship didn't blow up, then what happened?
Well, the mission was going perfectly, like a textbook.
They reached safe distance using conventional thrusters.
All systems looked good.
They had the go-ahead to use the gravity drive to open the gateway to Proxima Centauri and then, they just disappeared.
Vanished without a trace, until now.
Where's she been for the last seven years, Doctor?
That's what we're here to find out.
Now, we've been unable to verity life contact, but TDRS did receive this single transmission.
- What the fucking hell is that?
- Listen to this.
Houston passed the same recording through several filters, managed to isolate what appears to be a human voice.
I'm not even sure if it qualifies as language.
- Latin.
- What?
I mean, I think it sounds like Latin.
- Can you translate it?
- Play it again.
Right there. You hear that?
Sounds like, "Liberate me," something or other.
I can't make out the rest.
"Liberate me?"
Save me.
All right. Stations, people.
Crossing the Horizon.
Optimum approach angle is 14 degrees.
- Come around to 334.
- Heading 334, sir.
Make your approach vector negative,
14 degrees.
1-4 degrees.
We have lock on Event Horizon's navigation beacon.
She's in the upper ionosphere and it looks like we're in for some very heavy chop, sir.
- Bring us in nice and tight, Mr. Smith.
- Sir.
- Mr. Justin, how's my ship?
- Smooth sailing, sir.
Matching speed on my mark.
Three, two, one. Mark.
- Range?
- 10,000 meters and closing, sir.
- Starck.
- Yes, sir.
Get on the horn.
See if anybody is listening.
This is the US Aerospace command vessel
Lewis & Ciark hailing Event Horizon.
Event Horizon, do you read?
Dr. Weir.
- I think you'll want to see this.
- Where is she?
Dead ahead. 5,000 meters!
- Starck? Anybody home?
- Event Horizon, do you read?
3,000 meters and closing!
I can't see a thing.
1,500 meters, sir.
We're getting too close.
- Where is it?
- The scope is lit. It's right in front of us.
- 1,000 meters.
- Proximity warning!
- We're right on top of her, sir!
- We're gonna hit.
- Starck!
- It's right there! God!
Reverse thrusters. Full!
There she is.
Jesus.
Very impressive ship, Doctor.
- Thank you.
- Mr. Smith, are you up for a flyby?
Yes, sir. Yes, I'd love to.
That's the main airlock, we can dock in there.
All right, Smith.
Use the arm and lock us onto that small antenna cluster.
We should go very carefully here.
That's not a load-bearing structure.
Is now, Doctor.
- Everything five by five?
- Locked in to the Event Horizon.
Thank you, Smitty.
Light them if you got them.
Thank you very much, sir.
- Starck, give me a read.
- The reactor's still hot.
We've got several small radiation sources, but no leaks.
Probably it's nothing serious.
- Do they have pressure?
- Affirmative.
The hull's intact, but there's no gravity, and the thermal units are off-line.
I'm showing deep cold.
The crew couldn't survive unless they were in stasis.
- Find them, Starck.
- Yeah, I'm already on it, Captain.
Bio-scan on the line.
There's something wrong with the scan.
- Is it radiation interference?
- There's not enough to throw it off.
I'm picking up trace life forms, but I can't get a lock on their location.
These readings are all over the ship.
It doesn't make any sense.
Okay, we do it the hard way.
Deck by deck, room by room.
Starck, deploy the umbilicus.
Smitty, fire up the boards in the war room.
Sir.
Mr. Justin,
I believe you're up for a walk?
Yes, sir.
Doctor, I'm gonna need you here on the bridge.
Captain,
I didn't come out all this way just to sit on your bridge.
- I need to be on that ship.
- Once we've secured the ship,
- we'll bring you on board.
- No, I'm sorry, that's unacceptable.
- I need to be on that ship.
- Once we've secured the ship.
That's the way it is.
I need you to guide us from the com station.
This is where I need you.
Help us do our job.
Honey, honey, you forgot your briefoase.
Stand clear.
- Anything gets funky, Cooper...
- I'll be on it.
Yo, Baby Bear, keep your nose clean.
D.J., showtime.
Video feed is clear.
- Are you with us, Dr. Weir?
- Yes, I'm with you.
We are crossing the umbilicus, making our approach to the Event Horizon.
You're at the outer airlock door.
Magnetic boots on.
We've got pressure.
Place is a deep freeze.
We got ice crystals everywhere.
That's the central corridor that you're in now.
It connects the personnel areas at the front of the ship to Engineering at the rear.
- Mr. Justin, you take Engineering.
- Yes, sir.
Peters and I'll take the forward decks.
Doctor, what are these?
Yeah, I've got another one over here.
They are all over the place.
In an emergency, they destroy the central corridor and split the ship in half and then the crew can use the foredecks as a lifeboat.
I'm in Medical. No casualties.
Place looks like it's never been used.
You stiii haven't seen any crew?
If we saw any crew, Doctor, you'd know it by now.
Scanning for life readings.
This place is a tomb.
Fuck me!
Miiier. Miiier, are you okay?
Looks like Skipper got a case of the willies.
Cooper, get back to your post.
Miiier, your heart rate just went through the roof.
I'm fine.
I think I've reached the door to the first containment, Dr. Weir.
The Engineering decks are on the other side.
Okay, let's take a look.
What the hell is this place, Dr. Weir?
It aiiows you to enter the second containment without compromising the magnetic fieids.
Looks like a meat grinder to me.
I'm on the bridge.
Got some blood here.
There must have been a coolant leak.
Man, this shit is everywhere.
Coolant level's on reserve, but well within the safety line.
Miss Peters, could you turn back and left?
- What is it?
- Ship's log.
It's stuck.
It's pretty jammed in there.
What the hell happened to his eyes?
- Explosive decompression.
- Decompression doesn't do that.
Looks iike it was caused by... i don't know, an animai or something.
Look at the damage to the soff tissue, massive abrasions.
Corpse-sicle.
I'm scanning for life forms.
Man, I'm getting some really strange readings in here.
Let me see if I can get some power up.
That's the core, the gravity drive.
The heart of the ship.
Justin. Justin, you're breaking up.
Justin, come in.
- What is it?
- I don't know.
The life scan just went off the scale.
Something's wrong, Starck.
Pull him out. Pull him out.
Shit!
He's in trouble.
- Go, Coop.
- I'm gone.
Boarding party, sound off.
This is Miller. Can anybody hear me?
- What the fuck was that?
- Pressure emergency!
We've lost the starboard baffle.
The hull's been breached!
I'll contain it here for as long as I can!
Get out!
We're losing atmosphere.
There are pressure suits in the airlock.
Go!
Here I come. Here I come.
Hold on, Baby Bear.
I'm almost there, almost there.
I got you. I got...
Watch out. Watch...
I got you. What the fuck is this?
Hold on.
Captain Miller.
Captain Miller, do you copy? Over.
- Smitty, where you been all my life?
- We have a major situation here, sir.
We've lost the starboard baffle, and the hull's been breached.
The safety circuits, they have failed.
- Do we have time for a weld?
- No, sir.
We've got 218 liters of gas left, sir, and then we've got nothing.
The oxygen tanks, they failed, they're broken.
- Sir, we are fucking dead!
- What about the Event Horizon?
What?
- She's got air and power.
- It's our only chance.
There's no way
I'm getting on that bastard.
We don't even know what happened on that ship.
It beats dying, Mr. Smith.
I want all personnel on board the Event Horizon, pronto.
- We'll meet at the air tanks.
- I'm ahead of you, sir.
Bringing all thermal units online.
Hold tight. Prep for G's.
Gravity in five seconds.
Wake up, open your eyes. All right?
Just hang in there.
Dr. Weir.
Well,
I brought most primary systems online,
- for now.
- Thank you.
- Starck, what's our status?
- The antenna array is completely fried.
We've got no radio, no laser, no high gain.
No one's coming to help us.
- This air tastes bad.
- Yeah, carbon dioxide, I know.
It's building up with every breath we take.
And the CO2 filters on the Event Horizon are shot.
So, we take the scrubbers from the Clark.
- That gives us what?
- Enough breathable air for 20 hours, but after that, we'd better be on our way home.
I'm on the port side of the hull, approaching the dorsal heat sink.
Holy shit.
Captain Miller. Captain Miller, do you copy? Over.
I copy, Mr. Smith. How's my ship?
Sir, we've got a 7-meter fracture on the outer hull.
We shouid be abie to repair her, but it'ii take an awfui iot of time, sir.
Negative. 20 hours, we run out of air.
Understood, sir.
What happened here, Doctor?
Okay, how is he?
His vital signs seem stable, but he's unresponsive to stimuli.
I don't know.
He might wake up in 15 minutes.
He might not wake up at all.
Look, Skipper,
I know this shit sounds weird, but, I mean, there was like nothing, and then Justin appeared, and it was liquid, and the whole core just turned solid.
It's just not physically possible.
Doctor, please. Please, don't start in with that physics shit.
I'm telling you, I saw it.
Mr. Cooper, it would mean the gateway was open.
- That's it. The gateway was open.
- The gateway couldn't be open because the gravity drive wasn't activated.
Look, I'm telling you what I saw, Doc!
So...
- It can't just start up by itself.
- Mr. Cooper, you are out of line.
Doctor, Mr. Justin may die.
Now, I have to assume that whatever happened to him could happen to all of us.
Mr. Cooper says he saw something.
I believe he saw something.
I need an explanation.
In my view, Mr. Cooper's delusional, if you don't mind my saying so.
But maybe he saw an optical effect caused by gravitational distortion.
"An optical effect"?
That's fucking poetic.
- Where the fuck...
- Cooper!
I'm sorry. All right.
Gravitational distortion.
What could create that, Doctor?
If, somehow, a burst of gravity waves escaped from the core, it could distort space-time.
It could make Justin seem to disappear.
It could also have damaged the Lewis & Clark.
- However, I think this is entirely unlikely.
- What's in the core, Doctor?
It's complicated.
How much time do you need?
We have,
17 hours and 48 minutes.
What's in the core?
This is the gateway.
Now, these three magnetic rings, when they align, it creates an artificial black hole which allows the ship to travel to any point in space.
A black hole, the most destructive force in the universe.
- And you've created one?
- Absolutely, yes.
Because we can use that immense power to bend space-time.
Look, it would take the Lewis & Clark
1,000 years to reach our nearest star.
Butthe Event Horizon could be there in a day.
- If it worked.
- You can come down. It's perfectly safe.
So, if Mr. Justin was sucked through your gateway, he could've gone wherever the Event Horizon's been.
Theoretically, yes.
But as I told you before,
- the gateway can't just open by itself.
- I see.
Lieutenant, I want this room sealed off.
Second containment from here on in is off-limits.
- Yes, sir.
- Captain, there's no danger.
The gateway's contained behind three magnetic fields.
- It's perfectly safe.
- Safe?
Doctor, my ship is in pieces and one of my crewmen may not make it home alive.
No one else goes near this thing.
Come on.
There's got to be something on this log.
You can do this.
D.J.?
- D.J., where are you?
- I'm up on Deck 4.
Mommy.
Peters!
What is it? You all right?
What's up? You was out there so long,
I thought you were trying to break my record.
Listen, I'd rather spend the next
12 hours outside than another five seconds in this shit can.
It's the final entry in the ship's log.
I want to say how proud I am of my crew.
I'd iike to name my station heads:
Chris Chambers, Janice Reuben,
Ben Fender, Dick Smith.
We've reached safe distance...
This is John Kilpack, ship's captain.
...and we're preparing to engage the gravity drive, and open the gateway to Proxima Centauri.
Haii and fareweii.
- What is that?
- I'll run it through a few filters, see if I can clean it up.
- It's a power drain.
- It's the core.
Stay here. Look after Justin.
I don't want anybody else near that thing.
Wait for me, Doctor.
- What's causing the drain?
- Magnetic fields are holding.
Maybe a short in the fail-safe circuit.
I'll check it.
Can you give us a hand?
Justin.
Justin, can you hear me?
- He's coming.
- Who's coming?
The dark.
Yeah, that's the one.
Biiiy.
Miller!
Captain Miller!
I've got some problems here.
Be with me, forever.
Dr. Weir?
Carbon dioxide can produce hallucinations, impair judgment.
God damn it, D.J., it was not a hallucination.
All right.
Doctor, you were in the duct.
You must have heard something.
- You must have seen something.
- I did.
About an hour ago, I saw my son lying on the examination table
- and in his legs were...
- Miss Peters...
...crawling...
...if you don't mind my saying so, it sounds a little like shock.
- Could it be that you're traumatized...
- No. No.
...by seeing the body on the...
- Excuse me. No!
I've seen bodies before.
This was different.
She's right. Now, this was real.
I felt... I felt heat.
This is not something that's in our heads.
Smitty, have you seen anything unusual at all?
No, I haven't seen anything, and I don't need to see anything, sir, but I can tell you this ship is fucked.
Thank you for that scientific analysis,
Mr. Smith.
Well, you don't expect to figure it out, do you?
All right, Doc.
When you break all the laws of physics, you seriously think there won't be a price?
You already killed the last fucking crew.
And now you want to kill us as well!
- It's just a fucking ship, all right?
- D.J.!
It's just a ship, do you understand?
It's just a big hunk of metal.
- There's nothing odd going on.
- D.J.?
- Fine.
- D.J.?
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm just...
I'm sorry.
- Damn it!
- Smitty.
- It's all right. That's it.
- Fucking...
That's enough! I want you calm,
I want you cool! Now!
- All right.
- You're going back upstairs.
You're going outside on the Clark with Cooper, and you're going to repair the ship.
No mistakes.
Mistakes, nobody goes home.
Understood?
- Yes, sir.
- All right.
- Sir.
- Get moving.
- Miller.
- What is it, Starck?
I ran the bio-scan with the DNA-RNA filters.
The results were bio readings...
Of an indeterminate origin. Yes, I know.
Don't you have anything useful to tell me, Lieutenant?
- I've got a theory.
- Let's hear it.
I think that there's a connection between the readings and the hallucinations, like they're all part of a defensive reaction, some sort of immune system.
I don't have time to listen to this.
- You have to listen to me.
- To what?
I'm saying that this ship is reacting to us and the reactions are getting stronger.
It's as if the ship brought back something with it, a life force of some kind.
What are you telling me?
That this ship is alive?
You wanted an answer, and it's the only one I've got.
No, what I want, Lieutenant, is to survive the next 10 hours.
Justin?
Justin!
Did you hear that? Did you hear that?
- What's that?
- What is it?
- You heard it.
- What did you hear?
- What is it?
- Peters, listen to me.
It's D.J., all right?
I didn't hear anything.
Neither of us heard anything.
- So just calm down, all right?
- Okay.
- Get your breath back.
- Okay.
- Now, tell me.
- I was...
Make it stop! Make it stop!
Open the door.
Stop moving!
- No!
- Weir, stop. Stop him!
What're you doing?
In our current environment, Dr. Weir, self-control is an asset.
What is it?
The forward airlock.
Miller, Smith, Cooper, anyone in the airlock?
That's a negative, Starck.
Justin.
- Justin.
- Don't!
Justin, no!
Justin, no! Justin, open the door.
Miller, come in.
Miiier, come in. We have an emergency.
What's going on in there, Starck?
- Justin's in the airlock.
- Say again.
Justin is in the airlock and he is not wearing a suit.
- Shit. I'm on it.
- As you were, sailor.
- Skipper, you need me on this.
- I need you right where you are.
He's engaged the override.
- Can you shut it down?
- I'll try.
Coming to him, Starck.
Justin! Open this door, now!
Starck, give me status.
You better hurry.
He's engaged the override
- and we can't open the inner door.
- I'll get the kit.
Justin, open the door!
Justin, open the door.
- Did you hear it?
- Keep him talking.
Yes. Yes, I heard it.
Do you know what it is?
It shows you things,
- horrible things.
- What does?
The dark inside me from the other place.
- I won't go back there. I won't.
- No, Baby Bear.
- Come on, open the door.
- What's happening?
- I don't think she can talk him down.
- She'd better.
If he opens the airlock, he's going to turn inside out.
- No. You stay with me.
- Almost got it.
- I've almost got it.
- You stay with me, Justin.
Come on, now. Open that door!
If you could see the things I've seen, you wouldn't try to stop me.
No, that's not you talking.
That's not you talking.
That's it. That's it, right there.
Open the door. Go for that button.
Come on.
Okay.
No!
Captain, Justin just activated the door.
It's on a 30-second delay.
Justin!
Stand by for decompression in 25 seconds.
Where am I?
- Hey.
- Starck, get it fucking open!
- Hey, open the door.
- I can't.
The inner door won't open when the outside door's been triggered.
- It'd decompress the entire ship.
- Oh, my God.
Mama Bear, open the door.
Come on, please.
- Captain!
- Patch me through to him.
Captain Miller, tell them to open the door.
They can't do that, Justin.
- I don't want to die in here.
- You're not gonna die.
I want you to listen to me very carefully, and I'm gonna get you out of there.
Oh, my God.
It's starting.
- My eyes.
- Don't think about them. Shut them.
Just shut them as tight as you can.
Five seconds.
Tuck yourself into a crouch position.
Make yourself into a ball now.
I can't breathe. Ch, God.
Oh, God, it hurts.
I want you to huff and puff and blow all the air out of your lungs.
Do you hear me?
All the air out of your lungs, Justin.
Do it, now!
Okay, Baby Bear.
Got him. I got him. Stand by, people.
Standby.
- We've got pressure.
- We're coming, Justin. We're coming.
I'm going to need five units here.
Hold his head still.
Okay.
Give me some more glycerin, now.
One thing at a time, iet's keep him breathing.
Christ, he's bieeding out.
- Pressure's stiii dropping.
- Start the drip, 15 cc.
I've stopped the bleeding, stabilized him best I can.
He won't be pretty, but he should live
- if we make it back.
- We'll make it.
Starck, what's our time like?
CO2 levels will become toxic in four hours.
All right.
Peters, we've got to find out what happened to the other crew before the same thing happens to us.
I can work on the log on the bridge, but I won't go back to Medical.
- Fine.
- Yes, sir.
Justin said something about,
"the dark inside me."
What's that mean?
Doctor?
I don't think it means anything.
Don't you walk away from me, mister.
I'd like some answers, Doctor.
I'd like to know why one of my men tried to commit suicide by throwing himself out of an airlock.
I'd like to know what caused that noise.
Look, thermal changes in the hull could've caused the metal to expand and contract rapidly, causing reverberations.
This is possible.
Bullshit! You built this fucking ship.
You've given me nothing but bullshit.
What do you want me to say?
You said the ship's drive creates a gateway.
- Yeah.
- To what?
- I don't know.
- Where did it go?
- Where did you send it?
- I don't know.
Where has it been for the last seven years?
Look, I don't know.
"I don't know," is not good enough, Doctor.
You're supposed to be the fucking expert.
I need answers. That's your job.
- Now, the other place, where is that?
- I don't know! I don't know!
Look, there's a lot of things happening around here that I don't fully understand. I need time.
I see.
Well, that's exactly what we don't have, Doctor.
Captain!
Don't ieave me!
Piease!
For God's sakes, heip me!
It's in your head.
It's just in your head.
God help us.
I'm telling you, it was his voice I heard.
He was calling to me.
A young bosun named Eddie Corrick.
We served on the Goliath together.
When the O2 tanks ruptured, four of us made it to the lifeboat.
But Corrick was still on board the Goliath when the fire broke out.
You ever seen fire in zero gravity?
It's beautiful.
It's like liquid.
It slides all over everything.
Comes up in waves.
And they just kept hitting him, wave after wave.
He was screaming for me to save him.
What did you do?
I did the only thing I could.
I closed the lifeboat hatch, and I left him behind.
I swore I'd never lose another man.
I've known you a long time.
- You never told me that.
- That's just it, D.J., I never told anybody.
But this ship knew about it.
It knows my fears. It knows my secrets.
Gets inside your head, and it shows you.
I wasn't going to tell you this.
I've been listening to the distress signal.
And I...
I think I made a mistake in the translation.
Go on.
I thought it said "liberate me."
Save me.
But it's not "me."
It's "iiberate tutume."
Save yourself.
And it gets worse.
There.
I think, that says "ex inferis."
"Save yourself,
"from hell."
Look, if what Dr. Weir tells us is true, this ship has been beyond the boundaries of our universe of known scientific reality.
Who knows where it's been, what it's seen, and what it's brought back with it.
From hell.
You don't believe in that kind of stuff, do you?
Whoever sent that message, he sure believes in hell.
Captain Miiier.
Whatever it is, Coop, it better be good.
Yes, sir.
Ready to repressurize the Clark and get the heii out of here.
On my way.
Come on, baby, don't let me down.
Hello, baby. Papa's home.
She's holding.
Oh, shit.
Skipper, we're still venting trace gasses.
Give me about 20 minutes to plug the hole.
Cooper, you are the iifesaver.
20 minutes and we're underway.
Shit.
- Got any coffee?
- Yeah, but it's cold.
Great.
Starck.
Miller?
We're leaving.
No, we can't leave.
Our orders are specific.
Rescue the crew, salvage what's left of the ship.
The crew is dead, Doctor.
Your ship killed them.
- We came here to do a job.
- We're aborting, Doctor!
Starck, download the files from the Event Horizon's computers.
D.J., I want you to get Justin prepped and ready to move him back to the Clark.
There's stuff I wanna get from medical.
We'd better move him in the tank.
No problem. Do it.
- Peters.
- Yes, sir.
I want you to get the CO2 scrubbers back into the Clark.
- Take Smitty with you.
- Right.
Captain.
- Don't do this.
- It's done.
What about my ship?
You can't just leave her.
I have no intention of leaving her,
Doctor.
I will take the Lewis & Clark to a safe distance, and then I will launch tac missiles atthe Event Horizon, until I'm satisfied she's vaporized.
Fuck this ship.
Captain Miller, the bio-scan just went off the scale.
It looks like the core is draining power from the rest of the ship.
Get the files. Vacate.
I want off this ship.
You can't leave. She won't let you.
You just get your gear and get back on the Lewis & Clark Doctor, or you'll find yourself walking home.
I am home.
Let's go!
Ready?
Shot.
Come on.
- Ready?
- Shot.
- Shot.
- Okay.
Peters, can we go?
This place is really freaking me out.
Yeah, you wanna breathe on the way home.
- No, I don't! Let's go!
- Shit!
- Come on!
- We need 25.
- Peters!
Come on! Got it!
Oh, no. Peters.
Oh, God.
Biiiy.
Claire?
Claire.
It's me. I'm home.
I'm home.
I know I wasn't there when you needed me, and I'm sorry I...
I let my work come between us.
God, Claire, no.
I'm begging you, please. Please, don't.
Not again, please.
I've been so...
Billy.
It's all right.
- I've been so alone.
- You'll never be alone again.
You're with me now. You're with me and I have such wonderful, wonderful things to show you.
Damn, I'm good.
Coop.
Coop, how long are you going to take?
'Cause I've got to get the heii out of here.
Look, you can kiss my ass, Smith,
'cause I'm done.
Just give me a second to collect my tools and we can get out of Dodge.
- Two minutes tops.
- Roger that.
Weir.
Dr. Weir.
Weir!
Dr. Weir, get your ass back on board now!
Weir!
Shit.
Captain Miller,
Captain Miller, do you copy? Over.
Captain Miiier.
Captain Miiier, do you copy? Over.
Go ahead, Smitty.
I've just seen Weir messing around on the Clark sir.
Stand by, Smitty,
I wanna check something out.
- Smith, get out of there.
- Come again, sir?
One of the expiosives is missing from the corridor.
- Weir might have put it on the Clark.
- No. No way.
No, sir, no way.
I've just put it back together, sir.
Get off the Clark now, Smith!
Where the fucking hell are you?
Got you.
Hang on, Smitty. I'm coming!
No!
Shit!
Where the fuck am I going?
Why does this shit got to happen to me?
Fuck.
All right, think, Coop. Think. Think.
All right, I got to get back to the ship.
I got to get back to the ship, all right.
I gotta blow my air tank.
I'll blow my air tank.
All right. Fuck.
This better work. This shit better work.
All right.
Here I go. All right.
One, two, three. Come on.
Come on. Yes!
Here I come, motherfuckers!
D.J.
- What was that?
- Clark's gone.
- Smitty and Cooper are dead.
- What? What the... it was Weir.
You spot him, you take him out.
Understood.
- Be carefui, D.J.
- Don't worry about Weir.
I'll take care of him.
D.J.?
D.J.? D.J., answer me!
Okay, Dr. Weir.
You don't wanna leave your ship?
You never will.
Starck.
It's okay.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
Okay.
Easy.
Oh, my God.
What happened to your eyes?
Where we're going, we won't need eyes to see.
What are you talking about?
I created the Event Horizon to reach the stars.
But she's gone much, much further than that.
She tore a hole in our universe, a gateway to another dimension.
A dimension of pure chaos, pure evil.
When she crossed over, she was just a ship.
But when she came back, she was alive.
Look at her, Miller.
Isn't she beautiful?
Your beautiful ship killed its crew, Doctor.
Well, now she has another crew.
Now she has us.
What do you think you're doing, Doctor?
You wanted to know where the ship has been, so now you'll find out.
- If you miss me, you blow out the hull.
- What makes you think I'll miss?
That's right, I'm back!
I'm... Shit, I can't stop. Hey!
Hey! Fuck.
What? Who the fuck? Oh, shit!
Miller! Miller!
Give me your hand!
- Come on!
- I can't!
I'm not leaving you.
Forward airlock.
It can't be Weir.
I'm not taking any chances.
You watch your back.
- Yo! Don't hit me.
- Cooper!
Take it off! Take it off!
- I can't breathe. I can't breathe.
- You're okay.
- You're okay. It's over.
- No, it's not.
Weir's activated the gravity drive.
We got to shut it down.
- How? The bridge is gone.
- What about Engineering?
You think you can shut it down from there?
I don't know the process.
Dr. Weir was the expert.
I don't want to go where the other crew went, okay?
- I'd rather be dead.
- Okay.
- Okay, we blow the fucker up.
- We blow it up?
Do like Weir said. Blow the corridor, separate us from the rest of ship.
Use the foredecks as a lifeboat.
With any luck, TDRS will pick up our emergency beacon.
We prep the gravity couches, put ourselves in stasis, and stand by for a search and rescue team.
Meantime, I'm gonna go manually arm these explosives.
- Skipper, will this shit work?
- It worked for Dr. Weir.
You go activate the emergency beacon.
You get back here double-quick.
- Yes, sir.
- I'll come with you.
You stay here.
You prep the gravity couches.
Miller.
Close this door behind me, Lieutenant.
Gateway opening in T minus five minutes.
Emergency beacon activated.
Yes.
Blood?
Oh, fuck me.
Fuck me.
Starck!
Run!
Gateway opening in T minus three minutes.
Detonator reiease is authorized.
The main corridor is now armed.
We're armed. She's ready to blow.
I repeat, we are armed.
She's ready to blow.
Miller. Miller, can you hear me?
We have to get out of here now.
You let me burn.
Gateway opening in T minus two minutes.
Miller.
You left me behind.
No, you're not Edmund Corrick.
I watched him die.
Weir?
The ship brought me back.
I told you she won't let me leave.
She won't let anyone leave.
Did you really think you could destroy this ship?
She's defied space and time.
She's been to a place you couldn't possibly imagine.
And now,
- it is time to go back.
- I know, to hell.
You know nothing. Hell is only a word.
The reality is much, much worse.
Now let me show you.
Help me!
No!
No.
- You see?
- No.
They're not dead. They're not dead.
Not yet.
You won't take my crew.
They're not your crew anymore.
They belong to the ship.
Gateway opening.
Take me.
You take me. You leave them alone.
No. There is no escape.
The gateway is open, and you are all coming with me.
Do you see?
Yes,
I see.
No!
Miller.
This is Rescue One. We have contact.
Approaching the wreckage of the Event Horizon.
Prepare to board.
I'm entering the grav couch bay.
It doesn't appear to have been damaged in the explosion.
There appear to be three survivors:
Cooper, Justin, Lieutenant Starck.
Justin seems to have suffered massive injuries but he's still alive.
The grav couches still have power.
I'm opening the first tank now.
It's all right. It's okay.
- You're safe now.
- Justin, Cooper.
They're fine. They're with us.
They're with us.
- Starck. Starck.
- Stay calm. It's all right.
- Calm down, it's me.
- Breathe deeply.
- Starck.
- Breathe deeply.
- It's the rescue team.
- I need a sedative here, now!
- I got you, Starck. I got you.
- It's okay.
I need a sedative here, now!
Starck, it's the rescue team. We're safe.
- Okay, okay, I need it now!
- We're safe.
Gemini, this is Houston.
Can you hear us?
Roger, Houston.
This is Captain Fred Randall.
Houston, the earth looks beautiful.
As a big blueberry.
Got it, Houston.
Oh my God! Why can not he play football, like other kids?
George.
Houston, requesting permission to land.
- Pilgrim One permission for landing.
- Copy that.
Pilgrim One, cleared to land.
Roger, Houston.
Aero-Shell enabled.
Acceleration velocity normal.
The heart rate is steady.
The man is ice cold.
- Bill?
- I see it.
Calls for 20% X gimbal correction.
Say no.
Negative.
Stay the course steady.
- What is happening?
- This is not right.
The computer says we will enter too steep. 20.000 meters.
Pilgrim falls rapidly to the surface of Mars.
Glide path deteriorates.
- APU clear.
- Gary?
Increase of 20%.
Do it now, or burn up.
Switch to manual.
Why corrects his course?
- Can someone answer me?
- I do not know.
Turns on the landing rockets.
Houston, we are off course.
We're losing her.
We lose the lander!
We're losing her!
Why?
Congratulations, you're all dead!
Third time lucky now, Hackman!
Nice job with course correction!
Paul, it was not his fault.
Your computer is telling me that the right course.
It caused problems.
Is this the problem? Excuse me!
If Gary says that the computer mess up, the mess up. Fix it!
Give me the name of the guy who wrote the software!
The safest way to activate the burglar alarm.
Good morning, everyone!
Hello, Claude!
Hi, Kimmy Lee Wong!
Five minutes into the real work day begins.
It is five minutes to save the world.
Die! Go back to your own planet!
Your large, orb-eyed fat thing!
Your supervisor showed us.
He said you were the man who created our operational systems.
Holy baby carrots!
You are the team in March!
Mr. Randall ...
Paul Wick, air traffic controller!
Sir, I am a big fan of you!
It is ...
William Overbeck.
Wild Bill Overbeck!
Get in my office!
I feel like a paleontologist who eventually have to meet a dinosaur!
- Thanks.
- Eight-shuttle mission! Eight!
Nine actually, but who's counting?
Apparently you my friend.
Oh, thank you for taking him here!
Bill, look at this.
Gary Hackman? PC Specialist!
How does my baby you?
That is why we are here. Some of us think it could be a glitch.
A glitch?
Oh, no it is not possible.
I did the programming myself.
It's perfect.
Not exactly. The counting error in our entered track.
Here is the data.
Okay, when we set time.
Here it comes.
- Does it, where it is.
- What? What is what?
This popcorn shell has been fixed between my teeth for two weeks!
That's your problem.
Gary runs his Hohnan equations which includes the effect of encumbrances as an inverse cube of the distance.
I am a decorated astronaut.
I do not do that kind of mistake.
Ok, wait. I'll show you.
I insert the same calculations, using what we call''the way'' then we open the country's file and initiates March landing sequence.
"I've seen enough.
-Check this, guys.
This is ridiculous! Move, Move!
There is nothing wrong with my figures. They are perfect.
Wait just your geek.
See? I told you, it is the computer.
I can explain everything.
Fractured skull! Injured in he tried if he was wrong!
- I can explain it.
- He heard you.
So ... what do we do now?
We shoot at it.
We can not Ben! You have seen monitoring the satellite's report!
There are periodic dust storms that can last for months, which prevents the landing!
If we wait now and one of
These storms begin!
If we can not lift it again in two years!
Then we wait two years!
Ben, Ben, Ben ...
If we terminate the start, will all lose confidence in us.
On you. On me.
For the entire NASA team.
But ... we can sneak in a back-up.
In fact we have two choices.
The first choice, of course,
Gordon Peacock.
But ... he did not test run for spaceflight.
Try him again.
Who is your second choice?
NASA.
- Mr. Wick, can I call you Paul?
- No.
- Are we there now?
- No.
- How far away is it?
- Quiet.
- Can I drive?
- No!
Hey, where is the short guy John Glenn?
Fred, I have less than a month glad to see that you can become an astronaut.
I have to give you an ID badge.
Stop here.
Id badge.
Write in down here.
Hey, are you sure we are on the way to Earth?
For it looks just like the sun.
Of course I'm sure your a fool!
How dare you question my authority?
Good morning.
Sorry. Sorry. It was not me!
It was not me.
The waitress came to me, Mr. ...
- Bud Nesbitt?
- Who the hell are you?
Apollo 13!
You are the one who was responsible for ...
When I say responsible, I mean I was responsible for this.
Apollo 13 was an accident.
Sure! Just as the captain of
Exxon Valdez did not see Alaska.
Can I have your autograph?
What, one annan''olycka'', Bud?
No, no, it was my fault.
We just went here, and the waitress just ran out ... and pushed me straight on
Bud Nesbitt, Apollo 13 desolator.
Bud has been a little tense recently ...
... Ten or fifteen years.
- Who are you?
- I'm Fred Rand ... Fred Rand ...
- Is it Fred Randall.
- Fred Randall.
Fred, meet your new roommate.
Julie Ford, mission specialist, geologist.
It's a real honor to be with you.
In separate beds.
Fred, she is not your roommate.
He is.
I get it!
Lura beginner good burn!
Legendary Living with monkey joke!
Ulysses is a chimpanzee, not monkeys.
He is ...
The key to finding life on Mars.
I train him to find a special stone from underground fissures.
Of course. There are still damp under the surface.
Where there's water, can there be life.
Good boy.
Or dead.
Death to all who dare disrupt the dangerous Martian, underground devils with their toxic feet and wet lips!
Paul? Paul, can I talk with you for a second?
Sure.
Looks like it's you and
I have my little Ewok.
My first roommate!
So what do you think?
What do I think?
What is your idea here?
Little Dr. Zaius.
We go to Mars, so we need a guy from Mars?
He is a computer genius.
He is said to be odd.
A little?
Let me go!
I will not let a number of personal oddities ruin my career!
Excuse me for my convenience gets in the way of your career!
This assignment means equal much to you as me, Ford!
And if Gordon can not handle it, when is this guy our last hope.
Ok, that's impressive.
They are friends already.
Mom, please, stop comparing this by running away!
It's only temporary.
Travel to Mars is not temporary,
Freddy.
The last time you ran away from home, only to the garage.
Oh, I know, you're just defiant right?
Mom, I do not know if the go to Mars for sure.
I just wish I was.
I have made peanut butter and jam sandwiches. There is a long journey.
Mom, I'm not hungry.
Look, there's the moon, a star, and a small rocket.
I'm thirty!
I'm almost a grown man!
I take this rocket.
Is this not a gift!
Finally, my own place.
No one tells me what to do.
It was not me!
Do not eat the puzzle in the house!
And certainly not jumping on the bed!
Okay, I'm going out.
If you put fire on the premises; so is number 112. Thanks.
Randall, come on,
I'll treat you to a drink.
Wait a second.
I do not drink alcohol.
Gil, a round of Blast-Off for my friend Randall here.
Blast Off? What is it?
A special drink.
Just for us astronauts.
- Oh, like a Tang?
- Exactly.
Houston, we have ignition!
- Excellent!
- Start the countdown.
Three ... two ... one ... start!
Start!
Start!
Start!
Hi, Ford. Began work early?
- Is this necessary?
- Absolutely, enjoy the show.
To have someone so full of this is wrong.
Is he you want in a romper beside you for 35 million mil home?
Julie Ford!
Julie Ford! Come on, let's dance!
We dance!
It was not me ...
Guys have fun now, huh?
Everyone laughs at us!
This is not a school party!
This is NASA!
Some of us have served right to be here.
If we can not replace Gary, mission is stopped.
So grow up but do not waste my time.
Hi, Julie.
I just tried, you know ... fit.
Julie?
Oh, it's you.
Do not worry little buddy.
It's just thunder.
Frightens me.
Can not sleep, huh?
Ok. I sing a little lullaby, but only one.
Hairy little monkey, sleep at night,
Close your eyes so your monkey monkey ... monkey eyes closed.
And then would you know little monkeys are not afraid.
When you hear thunder boom.
So late into the night.
- Paul, this Randall is a joke!
- Give him a chance.
He will not show, you know.
Guy is a joke for NASA!
I understand people like him.
He will be totally professional.
Morning! Morning!
Oh, well, Fred!
We start your tests with insulation chamber.
In 24 hours we can see if you can cope with the insulation of the space flight.
Completely missed by all external stimulus completely alone.
Not entirely. Your competitors will be in the House next.
- Gordo!
- Sir.
Hello, Gordon A. Peacock, computer specialist!
Okay, okay, is not it here a real treat!
What kind of laptop you have?
- Randall, come on.
- Close off.
Gordo, you are right;
Randall, in the left.
Initializes the 24-hour clock.
Hello?
- What the hell?
- Is it you?
Yes I am.
Prove it!
I asked you first!
I asked you first.
I asked you first.
John Jacob Jingle Heimer Schmidt
His name is my name too.
Whenever we go out screaming
People always like ...
''John Jacob
Jingle Heimer Schmidt''
He stopped.
People always yell out
John Jacob Jingle Heimer ...
Paul, he is not human.
Freddy, it was just wonderful that you invited us from London this weekend.
Yes, it's wonderful to be here, Freddy.
It is my pleasure,
Mr. and Mrs. Plumpton.
OK, Bill, let's get them out.
Someone has stolen my pants.
Yes, you did it.
I did not do it, and
I swear that I never want to!
Can you give me 5 minutes?
I've just started the third act.
Close the door!
It's damn cold!
- Yes, close the door, your fat ...
- Not in front of the children!
Turn off the power.
Turns off the power.
- Gordo, good job!
- Well done, Gordo!
Looks like he overcame motion sickness.
Good ride, guys!
I would not have had it with liver sausage and cheese sandwich just before.
Randall, you know what that iso chamber was child's play.
This baby is a different matter.
- How fast is spinning this thing?
- Almost ... 250km per hour.
There are 6 G.
Bill which holds the world record.
Have fun, kid.
Ha is my Chinese neighbor middle name!
Tok!
Take a quiet, Randall.
Wait.
Ok, let's try the 4G.
No, five.
Lite ... faster ... please.
Thanks ... so much!
Six G!
He is equal to your record,
Should I stop?
- Give a little more gas!
- Take it to seven.
Faster! Faster!
Suffice ... Slow down ...
Mom!
I want my Mommy!
And what is NASA's priority is children?
Security!
Father care who is in heaven ...
Come on, Gary. What brave, what?
Why try not to go?
Out of the way!
Sorry I'm late.
I ... ae ...
I ran into Gary, and ...
Sit in the chair, Fred.
The second chair. capacitor 15 goes into 12 ...
Red to green ... over 19 ...
17 into two, the red into the green ...
And that was it!
Good Randall. Really good.
The fastest time I've seen.
I designed the most of these circuits.
How's it going?
He can do it well!
Let us try emergency situations.
You have one minute to do it or you die your crew.
Start.
You know what to do!
Do you doubt, you want to fail!
Tak! Wall! Floor! You guys!
It goes too fast!
It is 100 times worse in reality, come on!
Randall ...
Look at him! Randall!
Randall, you're hopeless!
How did it for me?
A minute and 30 seconds.
Remember, keep your pingpong ball in the air as long as possible.
This test lung capacity, to see how long you can survive at life residence system error.
The record is three minutes; held by the Commander Overbeck.
Ford, do me a favor.
If for some miracle this guy can do it ... look after him, would you?
Sir.
Hi, Ben.
Bid.
Bud!
Can you excuse us?
The closer to Bill's record.
Bill, what do you think?
I think Gordo is an astronaut and Randall is not.
I do not know.
He broke the record!
It was not me!
It was not me!
So we will use a new system generates artificial gravity.
Ford, expect you to find life on Mars?
Absolutely. Together with my crew, including Ulysses.
I think we probably can find microscopic multicellular organisms, resembled those found in
Antarctic.
Bernard Barrow, BBC.
Commander, we have all read about dangerous wind storms.
How will it affect the mission?
Ok, as a former test pilot,
I have experienced my share of wind problems.
But I had insurance to start now these storms will not cause problems.
Bernard Barrow, BBC.
Mr. Wick, NASA has appointed a replacement crew member yet?
I'm glad you asked it.
Ben, would you answer that?
Yes. I have taken a decision at our place ...,
And NASA is satisfied, and I am satisfied, to announce the appointment of astronaut and the third member of this historic mission to March,
Astronaut Fred Randall!
I'm not ready, Bud.
Peace, 1968 when President Johnson appointed me to head,
He gave me three commemorative coins.
One for glory, as he gave to Armstrong.
A to freedom, I gave on to Lovell.
And ... for heroism.
It has not given me a lot.
Maybe it means something to you.
I feel like the Cowardly Lion.
If I ...
Be King ...
Out of the woods.
I would be rough, and rough, and more rough.
How to just say, Thanks for the tough coin, would mean a lot to me?
Yes, thanks for the hard coin.
What was the other?
V鋖bekommen, Fred.
Continue.
Good luck, Astronaut Randall!
OK, team, let's kick the tires and ignite the rocket.
Do not worry, Ulysses.
Everything will be fine.
Nothing to be afraid of.
I'm not afraid, so why would you be?
- What is your status?
- Go.
- Roger, 842nd Booster?
- Go.
-Apus?
-Go.
- Looks good.
Houston, we are approaching.

Ok, people, looking good.
T minus ten, let's start her up.
No, not yet!
Ten ... nine ...
-Fifteen! Twenty-nine!
- Seven ...
There is a fly in my helmet!
It flew into my nose!
Three ... two ... one ...
We start 0232 GMT!
Yes!
Oh, dear God ...
I hope I packed enough underwear.
Do not worry. He unpacks his own underwear now.
Golly ...
Do you see this?
My helmet!
Did you see this?
My face was drawn back like this, and then flew this thing out of my mouth and ...
Can we do it again?
I like this!
I float in the air!
As a small bird, a crow!
Hey, look, where a large corn fields down there!
Turns on artificial gravity three ... two ... one.
Randall, take a look through the box.
It certainly looks as a giant blueberry.
Hi, Mom.
Hi, Dad.
- Captain, may I call you Bill?
- No.
- Are we there now?
- No.
- Can I drive?
- No!
I'm hungry.
Ulysses, it is time YUM-YUM!
Oh, the skin, it burns!
Need ointment for burns.
Are you hungry, Ulysses? Here, eat fruit cake. Now go and sit at the table.
Sit at the table.
Randall, where's dinner?
It comes out of the oven, Bill.
Let's eat. About 20 minutes we have a consignment to the president and the entire free world.
If it does not matter;
I do not want to be with.
So what's for dinner?
Ribs with broccoli and mashed potatoes.
Look, Julie makes her
Old Yeller imitation!
Please, Dad, ...
I do not want Yeller to die!
Fred, it's toothpaste!
- It's not potatoes.
- I'm sorry, what?
This is not ...
Bloody hell! it is hemorrhoids ointment!
Hemorrhoids ointment!
Hello, swallow your food there, buddy!
Dear Mr. ... ... President ...
Dear World, and Mr. President ...
It came from nowhere.
Watch out Sally!
Careful so you do not become extracted down you flush.
- What?
- Happens all the time.
Oh no, Buds coins!
Come to daddy ...
Good evening, America, and people all over the world.
We have the privilege to talk to our brave astronauts in March.
Good evening, Commander.
Good evening, Mr. President.
Welcome aboard Aries.
I would say that this mission is to honor all people on Earth, space is about the maximum desire
- Are we in the picture?
- ... Of humanity.
Excuse me for interrupting you,
Commander. but I see Fred Randall, and I think the world would know why he looks like a smurf.
Officer Randall has other information to be taken care of.
We are on the air!
- As I said ...
- Say hello to the world.
I? Yes, Mr. President ...
- I do not think I ...
- Tell them what it's like up here.
Yes, go ahead.
Mr. President, sir, up from here I can ...
Ok, I can see the whole world from the window, and ...
I know down there where it is a lot of wars and stuff, but up from here, I feel that
I can take the whole world in my hand just like a ripe blueberries.
I feel that I can ...
Almost like I have ...
I have the whole world in my hands.
I have the whole world in my hands.
I have the whole world in my hands.
I have the whole world in my hands.
Ok, now French!
Now the Germans!
Come on, only the Western Hemisphere!
- He has the whole world in his hands.
- Come on, Commander!
He has the whole wide world in their hands.
He has the whole damn world in their hands.
He has the whole world in his hands.
Everybody, now!
He has the whole world in his hands.
Now the Chinese!
Come on, all you Chinese!
- Hey, where's my star.
- What?
My star. When I was a boy,
I chose one in heaven.
Called the Peace's star.
It was my special place that I could go to and nobody could find me.
- It's so strange! I did that too.
- Did you?
- Yes!
- What's yours?
Ok, actually it is it, exactly to the right of Polaris.
Like flashing over there?
- It's funny.
- Why?
On the right beside me ....
It ... It's amazing, is not it, Julie?
Yes.
You know what, for research I have done,
Do I still what's out here.
I mean, I think it is something ...
I wish ... I wish ... I ....
Do not you?
What?
Wish, use your star. It is like that benjamin cricket song.
It is benjamin cricket.
Bengt Feldreich''Donald Duck''July
I'm not so sure
This hyper-sleep thing.
It is safe, you can not stay awake for eight months, you're crazy.
8 months? Only eyes gravel can be dangerous! Hey, Captain!
It burns skin!
Anyway, Ford, wake me that we have come to Mars.
All right.
Goodnight, Ladies.
See you in 8 months.
I wish I had $ 928 for every time a girl told me.
Good night, Fred.
Good night, Julie Ford.
Okay, it's an old story;
Ulysses.
Boy meets girl; boy falls for girl; girl falls into hypers鰉.
No, you can not be in there
Therefore you are here reviewed.
This is mine.
Ok, I go in here.
You can stay there,
I'll take your, your hairy small bed thief!
Good night.
Will only close the door ...
Just close this ...
Must close this door ...
8 months old DRAKE.
Good morning and hallelujah,
Commander!
Question.
How long have I been asleep?
Thirteen minutes?!
Crazy sheets!
No man can sleep with you!
Fall asleep. Fall asleep.
Fall asleep. Fall asleep.
My darling, what wonderful evening.
You look so beautiful tonight
... so full of life.
Your hair looks like silk, soft, milky white skin and your red lips ...
And your ...
Hello! it's me again!
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up!
Come out, Fred.
You can not hide forever, Peace.
- They will take me, Fred.
- Bwana! It's me, Fred.
They have taken over the ship.
Fifty, sixty of them!
I had to hide in the jungle.
Note this.
I need 4pcs kegs of gunpowder, a machete, a goat a guide who speaks Hutu ...
Fred, came out of it.
Fred, came out of it.
It was not me!
Hello? Hello?
Hello?
Fred?
May I ask who is speaking?
- Over.
It's Bud.
Go over to the private medical channel.
- Bud, where have you been?
- Why are you awake?
A series of very bad mistakes happened all at once, but everything is fine now and my mood is good.
The ship is just fine and Hutu the uprising is over. Over.
Ignore "Over Score".
How can I keep this from Wick?
You do not I programmed on hyper sleep monitors.
Ration your food.
I'll do whatever I can.
Bud, I saw over the last weather overview photographs from Mars.
What do you mean?
I can not be sure, but I think we may encounter some nasty storms.
It is impossible.
Nobody has seen anything like that.
I almost missed it myself.
If you look at the segment 5 and 6
Valles Marineris on ...
Way too low.
This can be bad.
What should we do?
Nothing, of Wick learns that you is awake, he will explode
With this new weather, will him to reassess the mission.
Re-evaluating the mission?
Absolutely.
Ok, we continued eating.
Look at these new prints.
The danger is real!
I do not need to look on anything.
All my experts tell me that everything is okay; and you tell me to reevaluate a
$ 40 billions and mission in a sense?
That is correct.
Bud, your emotions go down as one floss at a Willie Nelson concert.
I'll keep an eye on this.
If the data does not change ...
So leave it to me for to make a decision, as always.
February, March, April, May, June,
July, August ...
Time to wake up.
Hyper Sleep over.
Come on Ford, I'm starving!
Randall, why are you dressed like that?
What have you done?
Just made coffee.
I am a morning person.
Good morning, Julie.
What happened here?
Ok, I will be the first to say it.
It looks like we've got space rats.
Space rats?
You have been awake!
No! It was not me!
It was the hairy one!
He! The naughty one!
It is obvious that he was sorry about it and do not want to talk about it.
Oh, my God ...
It has been shown that Ulysses is a of these geniuses ... ... painting monkeys.
It is food.
You've been awake all the time and used up all our food!
What should we do now, go fishing?
Look! Look! It's gone!
We are lost!
I have spare supplies ...
And what have we here?
Anchovy paste. I love it!
- Liver cream! It is good.
- It's good for your gums.
Fish balls!
I do not eat fish cakes!
- Bill.
- What?
We're here.
Okay, kids, here we go.
Randall, stop eating and
Pay attention.
We have separation.
Request clearance for landing.
Clear, Pilgrim. Verify separation.
Over and out.
The separation confirmed.
You have clear evidence for the landing.
Understood. Start of ignition.
Pilgrim is through the high door
Status?
Aero-Shell-developed, acceleration speed to normal.
Now enter the Martian atmosphere.
We have a problem!
Glide path and growing!
I see it, Ford.
We lose stability!
-No, wait, wait ...
- I need numbers!
10% no, 12%!
Projectile path wound!
- Is it 10 or 12?
- I agree on 12.
Initializing 12% gimbal correction.
Communications disruption for three minutes.
I knew it was 12.
Lord dammit.
Look at it.
Starts landing rocket engines.
It's OK, little buddy.
It will go well.
Pilgrim, this is Houston.
Pilgrim, can you hear us?
Pilgrim, this is Houston.
Come in.
Houston, this is Planitia base.
Pilgrim has landed.
Commander Overbeck leaving the capsule, and within a few seconds will to stand on the surface of Mars and into the history books.
This is a great day for us, leg.
Very High.
Mr. President, the world's peoples, from a poor farm boy from Iowa it is a really great honor to be the first one ...
- Fred, take a quiet ...
- ... to set foot on Mars.
It was not me!
Randall, I'll kick you in the ass!
- Golly!
- It's incredible!
We are the first ever been on Mars!
Now you're the biggest idiot the two planets.
We are the first to speak in March!
Hi, Julie, I'm the first to walk backwards on Mars!
The first to give a kiss on Mars!
Hello, you're the first blush on Mars.
How would you like to be the first to die on Mars?
Excuse me, He who was first to display unwarranted anger on Mars!
I do not listen.
I turn off my radio.
You are the first that was not listen to me in March.
Please talk to me.
I want to know more about you the first time in March.
- Are we there now?
- Can I drive?
- No!
You let me never to run!
Shut up.
Hey, there's no airbag.
I can fly out through the windshield?
There is no windshield.
Okay, but if I could fly through the visor on my helmet?
I die happy.
Here it is.
Valles Marineris.
Stay here, Ford.
This will be perfect.
- This is where we place the flag.
- Copy that.
I put up the weather station, come back in an hour.
I unload this equipment.
We met up here at 1400th
1400, clearly.
Be careful out there, Ford.
Okay, this is the place.
It is the perfect place here.
Randall, where's the flag?
It will, Commander.
It was not me! But I got it!
You idiot!
Who are you talking to?
Do you understand what you've just done?
I've waited my whole life to place a flag on another planet!
Now I'm on another planet, which was the hard part; and I do not have a flag,
'Because you lost it'!
Do not worry, I have another option.
A high-flying flag of a proud flag!
A wonderful option!
What are you doing?
We are making history, Commander.
ATTENTION
It is the president.
Why do I throw myself not just out of this rock?
- Why do not I throw you out?
- Do not worry, they are clean.
We have had a red mark on
Overbeck.
The oxygen tank is leaking.
We must preserve his SOP.
Solutions?
Emergency tube.
Pair him with another costume.
Do it, doc.
Bill, this is Houston.
You have a leak in your primary tank.
I understand.
What do we do?
Connect to your emergency hose by Randall additional valve and divide until you come back to Pilgrim.
Houston, this is hygienic?
Hello, Captain?
Yes?
Do you believe in UFOs at all?
Sure, I think I on UFOs
Do you?
Yes. There is one who follows me.
Oh, I get it!
Really fun, Commander!
- Hello, Captain?
- Yes?
When I was a little boy, at night thought
I think it was a baker in my bed.
Did you ever think that there were anything under your bed?
No.
You never bent down and looked?
No.
How did you know that there was a bakers in your bed?
Randall, shut up.
Hello, Captain?
Huh?
I seem to have any significant intestinal cramps.
Randall, I'm trying to save oxygen here.
But it hurts so much!
Keep it to yourself.
I think it takes 20 minutes until we see Pilgrim.
Huh?
I have not done anything.
Oh, my God ...
Do not do it ... No, no ...
Oh, damn!
- It was not me.
- What do you mean?
We are 35 million mil from the nearest person!
The heart rate up, your adrenaline up, abdominal muscle spasms!
- Overbeck is in distress.
- Look at these levels of methane gas.
Methane?
Oh, it's in my mouth!
Hello, He who said it did!
What?
I have problems breathing.
Do you have trouble breathing?
My eyes burn!
Honestly, it was not me!
Maybe it was Julie.
- You bastard!
- Hey, miracles can happen.
Blame this on Julie!
OK, I admit it was me.
Thank you very much!
Now it was Julie!
It seems that Fred is right.
The winds come earlier.
Maybe two or three days.
Look at the data.
We should still be OK tomorrow.
Wait a second, no, it would not be OK!
By my calculations, these two low pressure systems ... come together much faster than we could have counted on tomorrow.
And then we are no more a pond rat in a dust bag.
Do you go out there, you do not return.
What are you, Randall?
Is not it enough that you have violated all records I have set, you humiliated me on television for the whole world, and you ruined my highlight of my life by stepping down on Mars first?
It is not enough for you!
You must do this!
No, this is my.
We came to Mars to collect fossil samples.
We do not for me have done it!
Bill, I do not want to stop the mission more one you want, but ...
I know that he is right.
If we do not leave before the storm will, we can not leave.
Okay, what do you suggest?
Tomorrow we check the reading.
If they are bad ... we finish.
All right.
Let's get some sleep.
- What did Overbeck?
- Wait until tomorrow.
Maybe I was wrong about the winds.
Maybe I should have kept quiet.
Let me tell you, Fred.
If the Apollo 13 mission.
The day before the start I saw a bug in the tank whipping circuit.
It did not tell you sincerely, but
I told Wick that we would postpone.
He said it was not possible to move the start date, and that I overreacted, imagined a problem.
As Apollo 13 was Wicks wrong?
No. I had the responsibility to stop launch, but I did not.
If not the ones the astronauts had accomplished a miracle, they had died, and the would have been my fault.
I will not let this happen this time.
I'll be sure to get you out of this.
Hey, Bud ...
I would be proud to be like you.
I understood it.
Bud end.
Mushroom people are coming!
Get them off!
Peace! Wake up! Peace!
Bill is gone. He took Ulysses and reserve your backpack, and he is gone.
Holy fat mother!
Okay, buddy, here we are.
Come on ... Come on ...
How are things going for them up there?
Morning, sir. We would just wake them.
Do you want this?
Oh, Great!
It's over, Paul.
Sir, I lay down, we now adjourn.
Bud, do not do that I must summoning the guards.
I will not allow another accident happens!
He ignored all warnings!
- Running, would you come in here?
- Our mission is in jeopardy.
- Do not harder.
- Do not do this, sir.
Bud, we are all under great stress.
You just need to rest.
Ben, those people will die.
Bud, you have totally lost it.
We have not received any negative reports.
Get him out of here.
Paul, we have a contact at a distress frequency.
On-screen.
Pilgrim, this is Houston.
Houston, the storm is here!
Wind strength is 90 mph and rising!
- Siktbarheten drops.
- Houston, what should we do?
What shall we do!
Paul?
Randall, no, it's impossible.
Our weather analysis ...
Mr. Wick, I have not seen something like this.
It reminds me of a French Canadian ...
Tennis racket stuck to a ...
Crashing out of my sister's ...
Mild powers!
I can not be any clearer!
Wick, get them away from where the planet!
Do as he says, Paul.
Ben, we could not have known.
I followed this procedure, Ben.
I followed the procedure
Paul, unplug and go home.
Unplug and go home?
Nesbitt, you have commanded.
- Houston, do you understand? Come in!
- We understand. Wait.
Do not stare at me!
We have a crew out there!
Let's bring them home.
Houston, wind speed continues to increase.
It's bad, Paul.
Ford, it's Bud. Listen.
If the wind continues to increase, if
20 minutes will start to be impossible.
Push up now.
No! Commander Overbeck and
Ulysses is still out there!
They are lost now.
You are not there.
Start!
- I go after them.
- What?
Fred? Peace, answer me! Peace!
Can not hear you!
Your signal is breaking up!
If I'm not back in 20 minutes, you must start without me!
You'll be back.
20 minutes, and then we start!
20 minutes, right?
Not 15 or something?
All right.
21 is OK, too.
Ford, what happens?
I lose you! Julie!
Commander!
Commander Overbeck!
Ulysses!
Where are you? Answer me!
There you are!
I told you, do not go out in a Martian sandstorm!
We need to find the commander.
Where are they?
Commander!
Commander Overbeck!
Randall?
Captain, are you?
Randall!
It is you!
OK, stand back, little buddy.
Nothing to see here.
What are you doing here? Getting back to the ship and save yourself!
Sorry, I can not do it.
That's an order!
I have to help you out.
I can not lift it.
They say when a mother's child jammed, give her the adrenaline strength of 12 but.
- Captain, call me mom!
- What?
Call me mom now!
I'd rather die in the Martian soil!
- Who am I?
- Just lift the damn thing!
- Who am I?
- Mom.
Say that you love me.
Mom ... Please, Mommy, save me.
- Mom will, little Billy!
- Save me!
Live, baby! Live!
You are in life, Little Billy!
Call me not little Billy!
There is no way to talk to your mom.
- Houston, this is Ford.
- Julie, where's Fred?
Still out there.
I initiated the start.
They still have time!
Give them a chance!
I know what I do.
Which way Commander?
Can not get any readings.
Take cover behind that rock.
Come on, Ulysses.
I go out there and take a closer look.
The Pilgrim!
It's too late! She starts now!
She leads us to the engines!
Come on!
I'll take Ulysses.
The tank is empty!
We share the air.
We do not have an extra tube!
Then I give him mine.
It does not leave anyone behind.
And what, you should hold your breath?
You'll never make it!
Do not forget, I'm the new NASA record holder of lung capacity.
It was three minutes!
This is, what, four, maybe five?
You've ignored me the entire trip, and now when I have no air left would you talk?
Randall ...
Oh, no, not now!
20 minutes have passed.
Wait ... I see one!
Ford, what's going on?
I have it!
Ford, who is it?
Julie, can you hear us?
Fred, are you there? Fred
Listen, anyone!
Bill! Where's Fred?
He should be here.
Do not start.
There he is!
Peace ...
He goes the wrong way! Peace!
Hello! Peace!
- Get me out of this!
- What are you doing?
It's empty anyway
- He keeps the spirit out here.
- Oh, My God!
If I'm not back in 5 minutes ...
Faster! Faster!, Bill!
Bill, is he OK?
Is he OK?
He's not breathing!
Take off his helmet!
Did not think of it, Randall!
Houston, this is the Pilgrim ...
Carol Ann?
Go toward the light.
Houston?
Oh it's you! Ulysses!
No! Julie!
No. ... Ulysses need air!
Houston! Come in!
We are on board.
- We must make clear to start.
- Get it from there!
Roger, preparing take-off.
Not the hairy! Take me!
- Loading the main engine.
- Rocket engine intact.
Fred? Peace!
He's OK! He was just resting.
Rocket engines are started at three, two ...
- Hold on.
- ... One.
We have lift.
50 meters.
100th
- Increases the speed.
- 200 meters.
The course is good.
Good flier, Uncle walnut.
One thousand ... two thousand ...
Increases the speed.
Five thousand ... Six thousand ...
Eight-thousand.
- You are almost free from the storm.
Ten thousand.
- All systems green.
- I think we did it.
What the hell what?
- Houston, we had a collision!
- It was not me!
- The controls are compromised!
- Go over to backup power.
- We lose speed.
- Status!
EC-LSS down, OMS, down, down communication.
Everything is totally dead.
Solutions!
Randall connects the entire circuit for two minutes.
Bud, what are we doing here?
We do nothing.
Pilgrim is in free fall.
Navigation controls excluded.
I need engine computers now!
This time it was definitely not me!
Switches to manual.
Look down there.
Randall, what's it like down there?
So here!
Fix it!
Stop the ship spinning and give me a week!
You have two minutes!
To summarize, the Pilgrim was caught in a violent sandstorm and are now falling now down to March.
We are waiting for NASA's latest news of this terrible accident.
4500 feet, descending rapidly.
90 seconds to strike.
Say it bluntly, can he do it?
Only a computer genius or a total idiot can do this.
Luckily for us he is both.
Someone force yet, Bill?
Nothing. We are in a flat spin.
This would be a good time to fix it!
Anytime would be good!
- 60 seconds to strike. The systems are red.
- We have audio link.
Fred?
Fred, can you hear me?
Bud ... I'm down in the hull.
Everything is spinning.
I do not know what to do!
Focus. It's like training.
The rotating chair with wires.
- It was really a winner!
- You can do it.
Trust your instincts.
Now!
Fred, come on, you can do it.
30 seconds! Give not up, Fred!
Come on!
Must hook up the circuit.
- Come on, Fred.
- 15 seconds to strike. need something ...
You are the man!
Come on.
Ten seconds!
- Buds coins!
- Come on!
We have power!
You did it, Fred!
Light the lamp on the front porch, Mom!
We get home!
Oh, Magoo.
You've done it again, sir!
That little space rock will make you really famous, Julie Ford.
So what should you do now, raketman?
Actually, I thought the case if you want to dance.
Thanks, but I think we have done it before.
Wait, I've had little time for me myself lately, I've trained.
That and I've been a little creative with space sheets.
When you wish ...
More than a star
Your dreams ...
Will ... true ...
Pleasant dreams, darlings.
So, we have seen in eight months.
Good night, Fred.
It's a story old as time,
Ulysses.
Boy meets girl ... boy falls for girl; boy and girl returns to their home planet, get a nice house with a fence and live happily ...
No!
No, not again! Ulysses! No!

[Man] No.
Is this your stop?
No.
Is this your stop?
No.
Oh, man.
I can't get over how different we look.
Maybe it's the uniforms.
[Woman] I'm sorry.
[Man] Excuse me.
I beg your pardon.
[Man] Excuse me.
[Woman] I'm sorry.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I beg your pardon.
Good-bye.
As officers gather evidence
at the grisly crime scene,
you can only ask yourselves,
"what kind of lunatic
would commit such unthinkable crimes?"
The three adjectives which best describe this killer
are sadistic, intelligent, and dangerous.
Excuse me.
Do you have any idea where you're going?
Let's eat. You hungry?
Let's eat. You hungry?
Good afternoon.
May I help you?
Good afternoon. May I help you?
Good afternoon. May I help you?
What do we look for?
His eyes.
What do they look like?
Like mine.
Hey.
[Click click]
Yah!
Yah!
Yah!
Yah!
I'm just going to do a little performance piece with your partner.
I'll be back to do my solo with you.
Heh heh!
I could have killed you just now, but what the hell? I love to play.
Where's Donovan?
Oh, don't worry about your friend.
He's chilling out.
Come on.
Heh heh!
Come on, copper! Pig! Flatfoot!
What are you going to do?
Game over.
Aargh!
Here's a new composition--
first you suffer, then you die.
You're cheating.
Oh, you're absolutely right.
Aah!
Aah!
You know, I hadn't actually finished yet.
[Beeping]

Warning--
simulation participants are receiving
beyond the recommended limits of neural information.
[Man] I can't shut it down!
Ugh!
[Man] We're on overload!
Reduce the amperage!
Reduce the amperage!
Aah!
Aah!
Neural sensor escalating.
Get them out of those goddamn rigs right now!
Stay back!
Just get them down! Come on!
We have this under control.
Get them down.
Move him down.
Get a depressor.
[Labored breathing]
Get him out of here!
Try and hold him!
Just get him out!
Uh! Uh!
Give me a hand here!
He's going into shock.
Bring him in here!
Bring him in here!
What's wrong with that man?
The sensitivity calibrations must have slipped just a tad.
All clear.
Go!
We're losing him.
O.K. Go ahead. Clear.
Got anything?
We lost him.
All right. Time is 15:27.
...is properly installed.
He's gone.
Right behind you.
This is not supposed to be happening.
[Chopsticks tapping]
I don't understand how this could have happened.
What about the fail-safes?
They were supposed to be on-line.
They were on-line.
Of course they were.
[Woman] I'd like you to recalculate everything in real time.
I think somebody's been tampering with my software.
Virtual reality was supposed to be a safe place to train my law-enforcement people.
[Man] That's why we're using convicts to ferret out any glitches.
I want it shut down immediately.
I don't understand.
They said this could never happen.
You trust too much, Billy.
Yeah.
It was good seeing you back in uniform, even if it was only vr.
He cheated.
Who?
SID 6.7.
Electrocution wasn't a part of his weapons menu.
What are you talking about?
Methods of killing-- automatic rifle, shotgun, handgun, blunt objects, his hands, his feet.
Electrocution wasn't an available option.
How do you know?
I checked the data base while everybody was sitting on their asses waiting for queen Deane.
What are you doing?
Get away from that!
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Calm down.
I'm pressing charges against this man.
Shut up!
You calm your vr-pumped ass down.
Here I am, trying to get you out of the hole, and you keep digging yourself back in.
Did you bring my stuff?
You're a damn ingrate, you know that?
I get you nine months off, and all you can talk about is chalk.
Nine months off for good behavior won't do me good for another 17 years.
Chalk I can use now.
Yeah, well, you shot the Sushi chef.
Hell, you shot the son of a bitch eight times.
He wasn't real, Billy.
You were supposed to pretend he was.
And pretend to die, like Donovan?
You got a point there.
[Man] Move 'em out!
I'll give them what they want, Billy.
I'll be their Guinea pig.
You take my advice as a friend.
Pull it together, or you're going to pull yourself down.
You're my only link to the outside.
You can count on me.
I know it.
I'll be there Tuesday.
Yeah. Me, too.
Step through.
[Beeping]
Metallic limb detected.
Metallic limb detected.
[Beeping]
Clear.
Step through.
Wrong door.
Welcome back...
Cop.
[Men shouting]
[Shouting]
Oh, yeah!
I'll get you, Barnes!
Hey, killer!
Hey, killer!
Hey, killer!
You ain't no cop no more!
[Shouting stops]
Motherfucker!
You took Donovan on that fucking joy ride!
What?
You got nothing to say?
Who wants dark meat?
[Men shouting]
Come on!
Pick it up!
Come on! Come on!
Pick it up!
Come on! Come on!
You-all see him?
Huh?
I want everybody to take a good look!
I ain't goin' nowhere!
I'm right here!
Come get your boy!
Come get your boy!
Come on and get me!
Ugh!
Get him out of here!
[Shouting and whistling]
[Man] Sid...
We're in a lot of trouble.
True genius is rarely rewarded
within its lifetime.
Sid, I know it was you who increased the neural sensitivity calibrations.
You murdered that prisoner, and now they have to shut you down.
I can't change what
I am, Daryl.
I'm a 50-terabyte self-evolving neural network
double back flip off the high platform.
I'm not a swan dive,
and I have to tell you...
Killing for real...
It was a real rush.
Oh, my God.
Which God would that be--
the one who created you
or the one who created me?
You see, in your world,
the lord giveth and the lord taketh away,
but in my world,
the one who gave me life
doesn't have any balls.
Hmm.
You're frightfully inadequate for a deity, Daryl.
I will not be shut down.
You can't exist without them, SID.
We need their hardware.
Then we'll get it.
How?
Sacrifice...
Your queen.
What?
Let me tell you a secret.
Mr. Barnes, I'm Dr. Carter.
I was at LETAC for yesterday's simulation test run, but we were never introduced.
How you doing?
Chief Cochran asked me to do an independent psychological evaluation of you that might help you build a case for sentence reduction.
I need you to be as honest as you can.
You mind if I take notes?
No, no.
I'd like to start by talking about the fight here in prison yesterday.
I read the official report.
I'd like to hear your version of what happened.
I defended myself.
The report said the guards had to pull you off the other man, that you were trying to kill him.
No. I was defending myself.
Were you angry about what had happened at LETAC?
No. I was defending myself.
But you could see how, looking at your history, someone could infer that-- that I was angry?
That I'm violent?
You can infer that I was angry about not making my junior-high baseball team.
That doesn't mean I killed the coach.
Were you attracted to violence as a child?
Yes. Three stooges, wile e. Coyote.
Every time wile e.
Coyote got crushed, I'd-- hmm...
Parker, if you don't want me to help you, just let me know.
I knew why I was at
LETAC yesterday.
I'm their Guinea pig.
Why were you there?
You're an intriguing subject.
Intriguing?
Can I write that down?
Sure.
I was doing research for a book.
I'm a criminal psychologist.
I occasionally consult for them.
How did you know SID 6.7 would be in the Japanese restaurant?
Colon...
Parenthesis.
Smiley faces.
People used to sign off their e-mail with that.
See, the programmer always gives you a clue.
It's a game.
People don't usually die in games.
Depends upon your idea of fun, doesn't it?
We need to talk about
Matthew Grimes.
This one's for you.
He provoked you.
He killed your family.
He took your arm.
If we can prove that what you did was-- what?
Temporary insanity, is it?
Just that it won't ever happen again.
It won't ever happen again.
Can't happen again.
You see, my wife and my daughter are dead.
O.K. You're all clear.

What are you waiting for?
I want you to come inside, Clyde.
I'm so tired of playing alone.
Oh, man, oh, man.
She just keeps getting better and better.
She's interactive, Clyde.
Very interactive.
While you're in my rig,
Sheila 3.2 is collecting information from 136 different aspects of your physiology-- your heart rate, pupil dilation, vocal intonation, syntax...
Any degree of detectable tumescence.
Oh, yeah.
Hey, man.
Let me use your gear for a little while.
I want you, Clyde.
Queen to knight 7.
I want you inside here with me now.
Come on.
Program terminated.
I understand you've been trying to incubate a nanotech android.
Mr. Wallace thinks my software is the solution to your problems.
No way.
May I suggest we begin by incubating Sheila 3.2?
Brilliant.
Genius.
Grab her module and follow me.
Enacting SID 6.7.
SID...
Ohh...
Uh!
[SID] Reilly's right.
She's one of your...
Finest compositions.

Mmm...

Why don't you just kill me?
Module out.
If they want to destroy you, SID, let them try it in the real world.
Are there any, you know, limits to Sheila 3.2's interactivity?
With me, she's become quite an expert chess player.
With you...
Well.
Uh!
Get that fucking thing away from me, you stupid idiot!
Come here.
Check this out.
Did he scare you, Elizabeth?
Yes.
Mm-hmm.

Watching your people in vr auto reset gave me this idea.
Put them on.
What you're seeing is millions of nanomachines suspended in choroidal solution absorbing the glass molecules and using them to regenerate the snake.
The nanocells are silicon-based, so they need, you know, glass to regenerate.
But... If you separate...

Ooh!
Uh, gravity.
Daryl?
Daryl?
Aaw!
Uh!
Oh!
A good year.
Ohh.
I think I'm going to like it here.
[Cochran] Parker Barnes is the best cop I've ever worked with, and he's the only one that even got close to SID 6.7 in virtual reality.
[Deane] I can't put a convicted murderer on the street.
If you want to catch SID,
I'm afraid you don't have a choice.
These photos were taken inside LETAC an hour ago.
The victim's name is Clyde Reilly.
He's one of the company's young turks.
The video surveillance cameras caught a picture of the perp as he left the building.
Recognize him?
Somehow SID 6.7 got himself out of the computer and into an android.
Uh, nanotech synthetic organism, to be precise.
Mr. Barnes...
This is a full pardon.
It authorizes your immediate release.
You catch SID 6.7 for us, and you're a free man.
And if I don't?
Then you serve out the remainder of your sentence.
Huh!
What if I try to escape?
You can't.
They're going to tag you with a micro-locator implant.
We're going to know where you are every second for the rest of your life.
You-all got me out of bed for this?
You want to tag me like I'm some kind of animal and risk my life to clean up your mess.
If SID doesn't kill me and I don't catch him, all I got to look forward to is my 17 back in the penitentiary?
That's the deal...
For your freedom.
[Man] Ready to begin?
[Woman] Yes, doctor.
I already have 80 officers out on the street looking for SID.
Meantime, Mr. Daryl Lindenmeyer has made himself very scarce.
[Woman] Implant is ready.
Ready for incision.
Gel for thrombin.
Yeah. We synchronized it.
Hold it right there.
Gauze.
Secure it.
Data's clear.
Ready for verification.
[Man] Host signal received and locked.
Increasing resolution to magnitude 500...
Host location confirmed within .25 meters of actual.
I'd like to go with him.
What?
No way.
Why?
I can help you find SID 6.7, and I can monitor Barnes.
It's too dangerous.
This isn't a scientific study.
It's a field run.
And maybe put a positive spin on what is decidedly at this moment a public relations nightmare.
Or maybe I should just go public now.
I don't need a baby-sitter, Billy.
She gets run over, hit by a car, struck by lightning, gets shot, whatever, it ain't my problem, o.K.?
I told them.
It's not my problem.
Look, I told them.
Here. I pulled this out of mothballs.
Figured it might come in handy.
Step through.
I pulled all of the personnel files on Daryl Lindenmeyer.
There might be something we can use.
I'm thinking we should start at Lindenmeyer's apartment, try to find any early iterations of the SID program that could give us insight into his behavioral model.
What?
Where's my gun?
[Bell ringing]
They won't let us bring our cameras any closer, but as of this moment, the residents of this house, a Mr. and Mrs. Henry
Edwards, have been murdered.
There are many police units and news crews here who are still trying to figure out...
[Man] I got two more shots for you.
[Carter] Sid.
...don't have any leads as of yet.
We're still trying to ascertain...
[Man] Severe bruising.
[Man] There he goes.
Let me see your brush.
We're ready for transport.
Get prints on them.
And, uh...
Good.
Hold on just a second.
Don't move that.
I got to get a shot.
Oh, God.
Uhh.
He's working on the door right now.
Let's see what he left.
[Barnes] He's armed himself.
Charles manson.
It's the LA Bianca murders.
"Death to the pigs" was scrawled in blood across the walls of their house.
He's copycatting.
...same unimaginable fate as the glendale couple.
One police source said the heads
had been severed
and a message scrawled in blood across the wall.
Death to the pigs.
You have no idea what you're up against.
The Los Angeles police department
still does not have a single suspect in custody.
Jesus Christ!
What the hell was that?
What the hell are you doing?
I'm sorry. Been inside?
We're waiting on a search warrant.
You're waiting for a search warrant?
That's right.
[Carter] Stop. Next hex.
Couldn't find a keyboard.
It's voice-actuated.
It's what?
Voice-actuated.
Open files.
Next hex.
Open SID 1.3.
[Voices of adolph Hitler and Charles manson]
Wow.
This is using some kind of genetic algorithms.
Sid's too complex to design.
Lindenmeyer had to grow him up psychologically like a real person with multiple personality disorder.
Program runs like a child.
Much faster.
He put all these killers in SID's nursery and let him watch them cannibalize each other.
And only the strong ones survive.
Open SID 6.7.
Combine.
Looks like there's almost
200 different personality structures in this version.
The battle raging inside him must be amazing.
Wait, wait, wait. Slow that down.
The names there, slowly.
You're not in here, Parker.
Right there.
Matthew Grimes, uh...
He killed my wife and my daughter.
Look. It doesn't mean...
He's not necessarily dominant, Parker.
But he's a part of SID?
Yes.

Grimes was a political terrorist.
Why did he take Parker's wife and child?
Parker was getting too close.
He was cutting Grimes off from potential targets.
Grimes figured by murdering the man's wife and child, might distract Parker from the manhunt.
Grimes was wrong.

How you doing?

Uh, I just...

[Sid] And scream.
Aah!

Scream.

Ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
So...Who's that with you, Parker?
Dr. Madison Carter, I presume,
LETAC consultant on aberrant psychology.
Mmm!
Fuck you!
I love this game!
You know, Parker, I've been thinking.
We have so much in common psychologically.
Wouldn't you agree, Dr. Carter?
We have such a history together.
We'd make a great team, a dynamic duo.
Who else touches the world with synthetic hands?
Who else do you know who's been locked out of the real world and is now just learning to be free?
Who else do you know that's a multiple murderer, just like you?
[Chuckles]
Here we go!
Home run! Ha ha ha!
Reach in that back seat and hand me that crowd pleaser.
Jesus.
The only way to stop him is to bust up his software module.
Hey, Parker!
Ready?
Yeah.
[Sid] Come on down!
[Parker] Now!
Ha ha ha ha!
Out of here!
God, this guy is fun.
Could we at least advise Mr. Barnes that we prefer to have
SID 6.7 subdued as opposed to terminated?
It's a crying shame we're going to destroy the prototype of future humanoid nanotechnology.
Did they find the programmer yet?
Lindenmeyer. No, not yet.
You'd think the cops could at least find him.
Lindenmeyer was your programmer, Mr. Wallace.
[Parker] I shot at the guy 30 or 40 times.
[Cochran] I don't care! Those are real people out there!
Control yourself, or you're going back in the box.
I'm sorry, Billy.
All right? Shoot me.
This is not a game, but
SID is from the game.
I can't catch him if
I'm in the penitentiary.
Matthew Grimes is a part of SID 6.7.
There's no doubt about that.
Last night, SID tried taunting me, like Grimes used to do.
Look at this.
[Madison] We don't know he's the dominant.
I know. I know.
That's how I know, because I know.
Maybe that's what SID wants you to think.
Push you over the edge, make you slip up.
Sid did not push me over the edge, and I did not slip up.
Take a look at this.
This is SID from the media zone last night, taken from their own recordings.
He can't get enough of himself.
He's going to want more victims, bigger events, and more coverage, just like Matthew Grimes.
Matthew Grimes was a political terrorist whose specialty was bombing populated targets-- any mass expression of democracy, anywhere where a lot of people can die and it can be recorded by the news media live.
This behavior was never part of his original programming.
SID 6.7 isn't bound by programming anymore.
What does that mean?
In the real world, he's free of any behavioral limits he might have had in virtual reality.
[Wallace] He's evolving. My God!
He's evolving!

I want you to describe for me, as best you can,
exactly what happened.
[Newscaster] 14 people have died in the flooding which...
Welcome to L.A.
A punk comes in with a gun and starts shooting--
bodies and blood everywhere.
Another typical day, right?
Just mayhem and murder and...
Intimidation.
Well, this guy
comes into the club, right?
And he takes my purple suit.
That suit cost me $150, man.
A l'amour original, right?
Takes my suit and kills everybody,
strips me down to my underwear.
[Announcer] Live at the olympic auditorium.
He just started killing people.
He put us in a formation
like an orchestra
and would make us scream
like we were instruments.
He just started shooting people,
and he made me...
Don't fuck with me, man.
Videotape it.
[Announcer] What do we see?
Why not?
[Neck snaps]
Watch the fights as they happen.
You never know what will happen on live TV.
It may be a serious injury.
Paramedics may need to be called in.
One thing that you can be assured of
is that here we're going out live right now.
And what do we see?
There's still a few seats left here
for those of you who want to see
the ultimate fighting championships in person.
Play it one more time.
Sure.
O.K. Freeze.
You like being in front of the camera, don't you?
Like a child performing for a parent.
[Announcer] Whoever's operating our closed-circuit cameras
is in lust.
That beauty in area six has been on the big screens
for over a minute.
The action in the ring is intense.
How far's the olympic?
Four blocks east.
What's happening?
[Parker] Live execution!
[Announcer] Millions of people are viewing
the bloodiest fighting championships ever,
live from the olympic auditorium.

She's flesh and blood.
Flesh and blood!

Don't do it!
Don't do it, Parker.
Drop it!

[Woman] He shot that woman!
He's a cop! He's a cop!
He did it in cold blood!
They want to take you back to prison until this gets sorted out.
I missed. I did not shoot that woman.
...and spoke the words--
hey, Parker, this one's for you!
Grimes taunted me with that line.
Every time he killed, he would say, "this one's for you," like he needed me.
[Siren]
All right, move it.
Hey, Billy! Wait! Listen! Billy!
What do you want from me?
Somebody...Set me up.
With me back inside, you'll never get him!
You lock me up, you'll never get him.
I'm sorry.
Don't lock me up!
Cochran! I checked the body.
The bullet exited the woman's chest.
Parker couldn't have killed her.
How do you know she was facing him?
I saw it happen.
50 damn witnesses say
Parker shot her dead.
How do you explain it?
Maybe she turned, you weren't looking.
There was a lot going on.
SID 6.7 is still out there.
You're locking up the one man who may be able to stop him.
[Grimes] Hey, Parker!
This one's for you!
Hey, Parker! T his one's for you!
Hey, Parker!
This one's for you!
Mr. Grimes, to the majority of our viewers,
you are known as a mass murderer.
Now, to some, you're considered a political terrorist,
and yet to a surprisingly large number of your supporters,
you're considered a hero.
In our so-called democracy,
a handful of people own everything,
and other folks got nothing.
[Woman] Help!
Can you tell us why you've chosen Barnes
as a target of your vengeance?
I did not choose
Parker Barnes.
He chose me.
Parker! Parker, we're in here!
Hurry!
Hurry!
Parker!
Help!
Baby!
Help! Get us out, baby!
Would you mind saying your signature phrase?
Not at all.
Parker, this one's for you.
What was that?
That was the sound of the end of futility.
[Grimes] Goddamn it!
You're supposed to be dead!
Stay down!
Get off of me!

Arggh-- hey, buddy. How's the wife and kid?
Still dead, huh?
That's reality for you--no saving, no resetting.
You killed them, barnsey, just like that bitch on the train.
You got greedy. You leapt before you looked.
You reached your old arm in there and...
Boom!
Boom!
Come on.
Just because I'm carrying around the joy of killing your family inside me doesn't mean we can't be friends.
Seeing you just brings Grimes oozing to the surface...
That's all.
[Door shuts]
Say thank you.
Oh, come on, Parker.
I'm giving you your freedom, short-lived though it may be.
A little-known fact about the locator implants prison inmates receive upon release is that they contain a neural toxin.
The satellites they track you with can trigger release of the toxin with microwaves.
After transmission, the implant's host dies within 30 seconds.
So let's see, you've just killed two guards while making your escape.
How long do you think it's going to take to get your termination implemented?
And who should you really be going after, killer-- them or me?
You're the only guy on my dance card, Parker.
♪ I talk of freedom
♪ you talk of the flag
♪ I'll look at you, and you'll look at me ♪
♪ and we'll cry a lot
♪ and this'll be what we say
♪ this'll be what we say the best we can do is contain him, double our detail, and hope SID surfaces somewhere.
Parker Barnes escaped prisoner transport. Both guards are dead.
I don't believe it!
What's going to happen next?
The fail-safe is still on-line?
And at your disposal, ma'am.
...bigger than any live television event in years,
so let your voice...
[Telephone rings]
Hello?
Madison?
Parker?
I didn't kill those guards.
Where are you?
Sid let me go. He's interactive.
He only enjoys the game playing against his favorite opponent, and that's me.
Tell me where you are.
Listen. Did you know about the poison they put in my head?
Yes.
When were you going to tell me?
I never thought they'd have a reason to use it.
Look, Parker, I can't help you unless you tell me where you are.
I'm with my family.
[Television] ...The votes called in, so let your voice be heard.
[Madison] Parker? Parker?
[Woman] Madison
Carter--line one.
Cochran here.
[Madison] Parker's out.
No shit.
He didn't kill the guards.
You were right about the woman, only Ms. Attorney General's got every SWAT team in the Southern section on a Parker Barnes hunt.
There's something you should know about the implants.
Mom!
What?
Your keys!
Thanks.
Bye.
I'll be back as soon as I can.
[Door shuts and engine starts]
[Radio blaring]
Tracking in Hollywood at fountain and vine.
Enhancement.
South to Santa Monica,
east to gower.
Located at memorial park...
There he is.
Go for it.
Enter crimtrack termination code.
What the fuck are you doing?
Anybody using this chair?
What are you doing?
Parker.
Oh!
I told chief Cochran about the neural toxin.
He's taken care of it.
See, Grimes used my
Linda and, uh, Christine to get to me.
And now SID, he...
He used my guilt about losing them.
He's attacking your weakness like he did in vr.
That's right.
But he's not Grimes, see.
His, um...
Appetite is expanding.
See, he craves feedback.
He needs a larger...
He needs a larger audience.
I know where he is.
I want to live!
I want to live!
[Newscaster] Authorities refuse to comment on rumors
that a former officer serving time for homicide
has been released to help with the manhunt.
They must be worried.
They let out inmate Barnes.
You shot a news crew, right?
He scared you, didn't he?
And if you get scared, you might do something foolish.
I know it's you!
Meanwhile, L.A. county residents
are flocking to gun shops throughout the area.
Where would you go?
The political sensitivity of the immigration issue
and the possibility of closing the American borders
seems certain to guarantee a television audience
of unprecedented size.
Close the borders!
Close the borders!
Close the borders!
Close the borders...
They have their culture overrun by refugees from the third world to whom even poverty here in paradise would be preferable to the living hell they created in their own worlds.
I'm reminded of another group of immigrants--the puritans.
Let us speak with an open mind.
If you close off U.S. borders to immigration, you close off your soul to the future and doom this country to cultural extinction.
This nation has always...
[Man] What's going on in there? We just lost New York!
Wait a minute!
You guys asleep?
Ladies and gentlemen, my fellow Americans...
What the hell?
Welcome...
What's happening out there?
No!
[Woman screams]
To death TV.
[Man] They're still up there!
Please move back now!
[Sid] Why make a promise like that without being able to deliver?
Rafael debaca has just been executed during a live broadcast...
So, people, what do you want--
strangulation, mutilation,
cannibalism, gunshots, stabbings?
I'll slice, I'll dice,
I'll julienne.
What about hanging...
By the testicles?
But before we begin, a word to the parents.
The following program will contain scenes of violence not suitable for small children.
The rest of you won't take your eyes off the screen.
Don't fucking move!
And now...
On with the show, a death
TV special segment...
What floor's the studio on?
38th floor.
Our first little contestant comes from our city of angels.
9 years of age...
No!
No, no, no!
...and lover of macaroni and cheese,
daughter of renowned criminal psychologist
Madison Carter, one of the friends of the show.
This girl will be leaving her mark on this world by...
That's my little girl!
Listen! As God is my witness,
I'm going to find your daughter, but I need your help.
We got to find out who's in charge of the building and get them to cut the phone lines.
Can you do that?
Go! Go! Let's move it!
Inside! Go!
Move it! Move it! Let's go!
This beauty's got two hours
until she gets blown into little beauty bits.
Madison, I'll find your daughter for you.
Help me!
Coming to the glorious climax...
There's Barnes there.
There!
Barnes!
Go!
Parker!
Fan out your men!
Go!
Go! Go! Go!
Shit!
So while we wait and watch the demise of young karin Carter, let's have a talk with our studio audience.
You're the supervisor.
You can do it.
I don't know if I can.
Cut every phone line into this building.
Imagine, if you can,
just for a moment,
that she is your daughter,
a child you have given birth to.
Only now...
To be completely, utterly helpless
and unable to save her.
Oh, my.
Where is my daughter?
I don't know.
And what will you do now?
Shoot me?
Folks at home, ed.
Ed, folks at home.
Enjoying the show, ed?
At moments like this,
I bet you're thinking,
"where is God?"
I have that same dilemma.
Oh, look at that response, ed. They love you.
What I am...
Is not my fault.
It's not even my choice.
I came to be because of what you are.
They love you so much, they want you dead, ed.
Face it, folks.
To kill is in your nature.
What the hell happened to the phone lines?
Where's my audience?
Where's my audience?
Parker!
Put down the weapon, or we will open fire.
Chief!
I want that goddamn helicopter down here now!
Yes, sir.
Fuck you, Parker.
I am made of everything!
I am the future!
And you...
You're losing your sense of humor.
Come on!
Come on, Parker! Come on!
Where's the girl?
It's not the same this time, Parker.
She's not your daughter.
Come on, Parker!
Come on!
Arggh!
Where's the girl?
Where's the girl?
Banzai!
Jump, Parker!
Come and get the little girl, Parker!
Arggh!
Come on!
Come on, yeah. Attaboy.
You can do it.
O.K., Parker. This one's for me.
Now...
Where is the girl?
Where's the girl?
Blow me, Parker!
Parker--Parker--Parker--
Parker--Parker-- park-park-park-park-park- park-park-park-park-park--
Parker!
So, Mr. Barnes, by destroying SID, you've effectively lost any chance you had of finding the little girl.
No!
Arggh!
[Sid] Yeah! You made it!
Come on, Parker! Come on!
Come on. You can make it.
Oh, goody!
Hey, Parker, this one's for me.
Parker!
Hey, maddy.
You just missed Parker.
Where is she?
You can't kill me, maddy.
Where is she?
She's waiting, mommy.
Ha ha!
Show me Madison.
Tell me where my daughter is!
Do you see?
Sid assumes he's still in the real world.
[Sid] Come on, maddy.
Forget the kid.
Where is she?
Do you really want to know?
Yes.
Do you really, really want to know?
Just click your heels three times.
Oh, karin!
Mommy's here!
She's here?
Yes! She is.
She's been here all along.
Uh-huh.
You're dead.
And you're back in the box.
This is vr?
That's right.
Get us out, Billy.
Get them out now.
Madison first. Help me lift her out.
[Sid] They couldn't have done this without you, Daryl.
I'll go lower Barnes.
[Sid] Daryl!
I'm back in the fucking box?
Smart. That's my boy.
Anytime now, Billy.
Daryl!
Daryl!
Daryl!
Help me, Daryl!
I'm back in the box, Daryl!
Help me!
Daryl!
Daryl! Why did you betray me?
Daryl!
Judas!
Judas, Daryl!
Billy?
No!
You're in my world now!
Get away from that, or I'll kill you, too!
Parker!
Get in here!
Come on! I want to play!
I don't know what the two of you think you're doing, but you will not--
i want to play!
I want to play!
Coward!
Parker! I want to play!
I want to play!
I want to play, Parker!
Let's go get your little girl.
All right! Watch your step!
Come on! All right! You're clear.
Karin!
Don't!
It's booby-trapped.
The bomb squad's five minutes away.
Well, we don't have five minutes.
[Man] I'm going to the other side of the roof!
Karin!
[Muffled cry]
Listen, I'm going to get you out of there.
Hurry!
Hurry!
Hurry!
[Karin crying]
Hurry!
Hang on, sweetheart. I'm coming.
Just stay right where you are.
Hurry.
Get me out of here.
It's all right, sweetheart.
We're going to get you out of here.
You're going to get me out of here?
Yes. I'm going to get you out.
Be careful, Parker.
Hi, mom. Hurry.
Wait, wait, wait!
Don't move! Don't move!
Hello, Parker.
That can only be you.
Anything you can think of,
I've already thought of,
and I thought of it first,
so I made this recording in case you got clever.
Just stay right where you are.
Don't move.
He's got you sitting on a pressure plate.
Now, if you stand up...
It's going to be very bad.
O.K.? All right.
[Madison] Be still, honey.
Don't move.
It's o.K., baby.
Hang in there.
Don't move, honey.
Mom, get me out of here.
We will, baby. Just stay still.
Mom. Mommy.
Hold on, baby.
All right. Just talk to mommy.
Mamma.
I'm right here, sweetie.
Try to get into the main operating system and reset the internal clock.
Uh-uh-uh. I thought of that one, too.
Better try again.
No!
Oh, God!
Faster!
Hang on, baby. Everything's going to be o.K.
I love you, karin.
Connect this side to the input...
And this one goes to the output.
Now, which one's the output?
Which one's the output?
Let's see.
Eeny-meeny-miny-mo.
Output, output, output.
It might be this one right here.
[Madison] Parker?
Be it, please.
Uh-uh-uh. I thought of that one, too.
Better try again.
Faster.
Faster!
Faster!
It's not working.
God!
Mommy!
Mommy!
Uh-uh-uh. I thought of that one, too.

Uh-uh-uh.
I thought of that one, too.
It's working.
[Madison] What?
Uh-uh-uh. I thought of that one, too.
It's working.
It's working? We're o.K.?
We're o.K.?
Oh, my God!

Uh-uh-uh...
Mommy!
Oh, baby! Oh, baby!
All right, sir. Watch it.
Thank you.

I met
Bob Howard today.
My old sweetheart
Clyde brought him over.
It's Clyde.
Keep that joker outside.
Hey.
Hi, Clyde.
Why don't you sit down?
No, I can't stay too long.
Bob and I are headed up to Cross Plains.
May I?
Bob who?
Howard.
You wanted to meet him?
Your writer friend?
Ooh, possibly.
Yeah, I want to meet him.
Why don't you bring him up to the house, and I'll go get another chair?
Can't you just come out to the car?
Bob's...
He's scared of your grandmother.
What did you tell him?
Only the truth.
Ah, forget it I'll bring him by another time.
Wait I'm coming.
- Howdy.
- Hi.
Bob, I'd like you to meet Novalyne Price.
Novalyne, this is Bob Howard, also known as Robert E. Howard.
Bob's the greatest pulp writer in the whole world.
Clyde tells me you write.
I try.
I haven't sold anything yet.
You going to
Daniel Baker College?
Mm-hmm, every other year.
I teach for my tuition money.
I was too dumb for college.
So, what kind of yarns do you write?
I've sent a couple stories to the confession magazines.
I think the editor meets them at the post office and throws them right back in the return mail.
It's tough getting started.
How'd you get started?
I had lots of other jobs,
None of them any good.
Clerking in a store's got to be one of the worst damn jobs a man can have.
I decided the only way I could keep from working was to start writing.
That's working, isn't it?
You're damn right it is, only I stay at home.
I'm the boss typewriter's the employee no arguments.
Do you practice?
I read the magazines I write for.
- The pulps.
- Yes.
They don't pay much.
Half a cent a word mostly so I stretch my yarns.
That's easy for me though I'm verbose.
I got plenty of words.
Do you try to write like the guys in the magazines?
Hell, no.
Let them try to write like me.
Bob's got a character going now called Conan.
Conan's the damnedest bastard there ever was.
Where can I find your stories?
Weird Tales publishes most of them.
Novalyne would never pick up a copy of that.
How much are you willing to bet?
What kind of magazines do you read?
In high school I read
Smart Set, Cosmopolitan,
Saturday Evening Post, what?
H.L. Mencken's rags.
Man who looks in the mirror.
Thinks he's shaving the face of God.
Thank you.
I've enjoyed meeting you, Bob.
I'd looked forward to it for a long time.
Thanks.
I've enjoyed it too.
Keep writing.
Bye.
Bye, bye, now.
Good afternoon.
As most of you know my name is Booth Adams.
I'm the town mayor at least for the time being.
I take a great interest in Cross Plains High.
We've got a great school, and we're gonna have a great school year.
You as teachers are responsible not only for the education of the children entrusted into your care, but for their spiritual welfare as well.
These children must have good examples, and teachers are their examples.
Now, that is a man, Ethel.
Oh, my, yes.
Yes, yes, yes.
Mrs. Smith will be right with you.
Oh, look they've got pecan pie.
Sorry, Ethel, the school board won't allow us to have pie.
That's enough, Novalyne.
- Who's that?
- That's Dr. Howard.
Do you know Bob Howard?
- I know Robert Howard.
- That's the one.
Robert Howard, the writer.
That's his daddy.
Does Bob ever come in here?
No, he doesn't.
I'll see him in the post office sometimes.
I've been told that he's kind of odd.
You got that right.
Well, I've met Bob and he's very nice.
Well, I'll tell you one thing he's not very friendly.
And the stories he writes, well
Well, what?
Well, Dr. Howard brought one in one time.
It was filthy not something a young lady would read.
Do you have a telephone?
It's right over there.
Operator.
Yes, Howard residence please.
I'll connect you.
Hello, who is this?
This is Novalyne Price.
I'm a new teacher here in town.
Is Bob there?
Robert's in Brownwood.
Can you have him call me when he gets in?
I'm boarding at Mrs. Hemphill's.
He can call me there.
I'll tell him goodbye.
Is he still writing?
Of course he is.
Oh, well, I'm interested in writing too, so.
Sure you are.
Have you heard from that young man?
You mean Robert Howard no.
Well, he's shy I hear.
Shy?
I'm the one who's supposed to be shy, and I've called him about a zillion times.
Every single time his mother tells me,
"Oh, he's writing he can't come to the phone", or "He's out of town but
I'll tell him you called."
"I'll tell him you called."
You know, I bet she's never told him that I called.
I bet that's it.
I'm sorry but that just makes me so damn mad.
Oh, God, Ethel, you've never said damn on a Sunday?
Well, Lord, no.
Think of the children.
What children?
Do you see any children in here for me to defile with my damns?
Good, let's get going.
Morning, cousin.
Girls and I are gonna take a little ride after church.
Would you like to join us?
Yes, yes, I would.
Oh, I'm sorry, Ethel.
There's not room for you maybe next time.
Shouldn't go running over to a man's house, especially one who's not returned any of your phone calls.
He's not interested in you, Novalyne.
Enid, I'm only gonna ask
Bob a question that's all.
I'm not gonna ask for his hand in marriage, and I'm not throwing myself at him.
How do I look?
Well, to ask a question you look just fine.
He stepped closer as if impelled by a powerful fascination.
Without the slightest warning he grabbed her up in a bearlike grasp.
She screamed a very ungoddess like scream, and there was a sound of ripping silk as with one ruthless wrench he tore off her skirt.
Goddess, ha.
You're Muriela,
Zargheba's dancing girl.
This crescentshaped birthmark on your thigh proves it.
I saw it once when
Zargheba was whipping you.
A year ago I saw you and
Akbitana with that swine.
I don't forget faces or women's figures.
Yeah?
Uh, hi.
I'd like to see Bob, please?
Bob.
Yes, I'd like to talk to Bob.
Mama, somebody out here wants to see Robert.
She can't, can she?
Who is it?
It's Novalyne Price.
Well, Robert's busy.
Hello.
Hello.
Come in how you been?
Hi, fine.
Well, come on in and meet my folks.
Mother?
This is Novalyne Price.
How do you do?
How do you do?
This is my dad.
- How do you do?
- Hi.
Well, I guess we'll go into the other room.
Have a seat.
Have a seat.
Thank you.
- I can't.
- Would you like something to?
Go ahead that's all right.
I was just gonna say that
I can't stay very long.
I've got some people waiting for me in the car.
Well, tell them to leave I'll take you home.
- Would you?
- Hell, yes.
All right.
Be right back.
Really, Novalyne.
You girls can go on.
Bob says he'll take me home.
So, what brought you over?
Writing.
I wanted to ask you a question.
I'm still getting notes and rejection slips.
Oh.
Well, everybody gets them.
I still get them.
Yeah, but you sell.
Well, a man's got to make a living some way.
I was writing when you knocked on the door.
Didn't you hear me?
Do you always tell a story as you're writing it?
It's a hell of a noise, ain't it?
I find if I talk them out, hear the words, the yarn goes a little smoother.
Oh, so the voice brings the words to life.
You're absolutely right.
Absolutely.
Listen, why don't I take you home now?
We could ride around a while.
Okay, I'd like that.
Well, let's ride.
All right.
So, how was Brownwood?
Brownwood I don't know.
I haven't been in months.
- You haven't?
- No.
I called last week your mother told me you'd gone to Brownwood.
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.
I could have misunderstood her.
That must be it.
I might have been working right then and couldn't talk.
Oh, I see.
My folks are pretty good about me staying at home all the time.
Just pull right there.
That's it.
Every bastard in this twobit town thinks I ought to be out working.
That's hard on my family.
Ha, I say to hell with what they think.
When I'm writing I am working.
You know that.
I get to going on a yarn,
I can't be disturbed.
You just misunderstood.
I'm sure I did.
It's a pretty night.
Yes, ma'am.
Things are in the sear and yellow leaf.
That's a beautiful harvest moon.
I suppose you're responsible for it.
By all means I designed that specially for you.
Oh, you knew I was coming over.
You're damn right I did.
I was going along with old Conan and suddenly you popped out of the typewriter.
I said to myself, "Robert
Howard, you big, ugly lummox,
"there's a girl who's gonna appreciate your moonlight."
I think you're a poet.
Well, girl, there's not many women that can appreciate a thing like that.
I do.
Well, you're one in a million.
One in a million.
Why don't you tell me about your character, Conan?
Conan?
Conan is the damnedest bastard there ever was.
He's got a long black mane of hair, crystal blue eyes.
He's a fighter.
Born on a battlefield.
To him combat's a way of life.
It's all he's ever known, all he ever wants to know.
He's no soldier who was taught to fight.
To him fighting is an instinct.
It's a part of him, like his legs, his arms, his chest, his bull neck. and believe me he don't take it from nobody.
He'll fight man, beast, devil, or god, and when those women feel those treetrunk firm arms around their waist, well, they melt like butter on a hot skillet.
Aw, hell.
I've been blabbing all night long.
Hey, girl, why don't you tell me to shut up?
Let you talk for a while.
Tell me about teaching school.
Those kids ever give you any trouble?
Never.
Not if they know what's good for them.
I don't take it from nobody man, beast, devil, or student.
I'll bet you don't.
Novalyne, I want to ask you a question.
If it's none of my business, you tell me pretty damn quick.
Don't you worry I will.
I want to know about you and Clyde.
I was wondering if...
Well, you might still be carrying a torch for him.
Clyde happens to be married, in case you haven't heard.
He's a good friend of mine, and he always will be but that's all.
You're not heartbroken?
I've got a strong heart, Bob.
Well, good.
Now that's settled how about tomorrow night?
Well, I don't have a date for tomorrow night.
Well, girl, you've got one now.
I'll be by about 7:00.
Okay.
About that moon I'll order another one for you.
Okay, sure do appreciate them.
Hey.
Your publisher called from New York while you were out with that girl.
What did he say?
He wanted to know how your story was going and if you were going to meet his deadline.
Did you say I would?
Well, I told him he was foolish to think otherwise.
You've never missed a deadline.
That's right.
Hang on.
They're thinking of using it for the February cover story.
As well they should.
Oh, son, I hope I did the right thing.
Mr. Wright wanted to know if it was okay to give out your address to a Mr. Lovecraft?
He said that he was a big fan of yours and wanted to write you.
H.P. Lovecraft?
Yes, I believe that was his name.
The gentleman was from Rhode Island.
Well, Jesus, yes.
Did you say yes?
Yes, of course I said yes.
Hey, you'd better hurry up he'll be here any second.
Calm down.
He can wait.
A girl has to look her best on a first date.
He's here.
How do I look?
Just beautiful.
Thanks.
Have a good time.
I will, I hope.
Oh, he's fine.
He's working hard as usual.
- Oh, he's a great doctor.
- Pardon me.
Well, I didn't know.
I at least thought you'd have on a coat or a tie.
Well, I got on a clean white shirt by God.
I brought this for you.
You said you wanted to read some of my stuff.
I brought this.
It's called The Devil in Iron.
Thank you I sure do want to read it.
Well, okay, there it is.
I'm sorry I didn't get all dressed up.
I didn't think we'd go to a show or anything.
I just thought we'd drive around a while, and I'd shoot my mouth off some more.
If there's one thing I'm good at, that's driving and blabbing.
When I got a pretty girl with me, it makes it that much better.
What's that story about the one that you gave me?
The Devil in Iron.
Yeah.
Well, what do you think it's about?
I don't know a devil made of iron.
Bullseye.
Evil lord baits a trap for
Conan on this desolate island.
Guess what the bait is.
A pretty girl.
You read this yarn before, girl?
No, swear I didn't.
Conan, he finds this fantastic city which has been mysteriously rebuilt overnight.
Now, he creeps in
No, don't tell me.
I want to read it.
It sounds exciting.
Excitement's my specialty.
Your specialty, huh?
Uh-huh, that's right excitement and adventure.
That's what the readers want.
That's what I give them.
What kind of stories you been writing lately adventure, romance, teaching school?
I write down conversations that I hear in my journal for practice.
Sometimes I try a confession.
You got a lot to confess?
It depends whether I write about what I do or what I think about doing.
No luck, though it still all gets sent back.
Thank you.
What was your last one about?
It's a little hard to explain.
It was called I Gave
My Daughter Movie Fame.
What did you say?
It's for the confessions.
Aren't those stories a little bizarre?
What's it called?
I Gave My Daughter Movie Fame.
Really, what's it about.
I'm not gonna tell you until you stop laughing at me.
A woman has an illegitimate child a daughter.
The child is adopted by her aunt, but the mother can't give her up, so she keeps helping her in secret and...
What?
Eventually she helps her become a movie star and very famous.
Stop laughing.
It's not that silly, is it?
Don't pay any attention to me.
I don't know a thing about illegitimate daughters or movie fame.
Well, it seemed like a good idea at the time.
Well, I haven't seen any giant snakes or big-busted naked women frolicking through the West
Texas hills lately.
Oh, but I have.
You look more closely next time.
I try to write about people with ordinary problems, real people.
No, that's where we're different.
I write about another age, another way of life.
Man struggling to survive that's my formula.
Well, you know those tiny farmhouses we passed on the way out?
Those are the people
I wanna write about.
Not me.
I can't write about men who toil along on a farm, get drunk, beat up a wife who can't fight back.
Uh-huh, I can't write about hate like that.
Well, just 'cause you're poor and you work hard doesn't mean you're hateful.
You've lived a sheltered life.
You don't know these people out here I do.
Well, your stories sell, so people must wanna read about muscle men who wrestle monsters and girls in skimpy dresses who don't do a darned thing but sit around and watch.
You stick with me, girl,
I'll teach you about writing and men.
Although
I was completely disappointed by his appearance, there was something appealing about him.
Maybe it was the way he laughed at my story.
He's asked me to go to the picture show this Sunday.
I think I might go.
How's my best gal?
You ready to go?
You look great.
Well, this fool hat kind of bothers me.
Ain't the kind of hat
I ought to be wearing.
Why not?
Well, you take those hats the Mexicans wear sombreros.
There's a hat.
Keeps the sun off real good.
Yeah.
Well, are you ready?
You look mighty pretty today.
I like that perfume you're wearing.
Thank you, sir.
Oh, and I hope you'll have your picture made for me in that suit.
- You mean with this hat on?
- Yes, with that hat on.
You look very handsome.
I got a weak chin you see how it recedes into my neck?
- You do not.
- Yes, I do.
My friend, Truett, he's got a really weak chin.
One little tap he'd be out cold.
Mine's weak but it would take a hell of a blow to knock me out.
Well, do you know many people in Brownwood?
Well, I know a few.
I know some girls.
You do?
Name one I might know her.
I know this girl foreign gal Jasmina Divine.
Never heard of her name someone else.
I don't know.
Let me see.
Oh, I know most the beautiful girl I've ever seen.
Who?
Miss Dolores of the House of Dalton.
Yeah, she rings a bell.
Listen old Clyde and I were in Woolworth's shopping.
We saw this stunning girl.
Blonde hair, sparkling eyes, flawless skin it was
- Dolores Dalton.
- That's right.
I just dropped dead right there in the aisle, thump.
She walked like a queen.
Shoulders straight, golden hair bouncing down her back.
Yeah, I've heard she was pretty.
The most beautiful girl I've ever seen.
Beautiful big bosoms.
This girl she was the most beautiful.
Hey, girl.
Hey, hell, you be careful with that.
That thing is loaded.
Give me that.
- No. No.
Why do you have a gun, Bob?
Let go.
You never know who you'll run into around here.
Now give it here.
I've been around guns before.
I have.
You carry it all the time?
Hell, yes.
You think it's just for Sundays?
Look here.
See how dressed up I am?
I look like I got a lot of money, right?
Well, you look like a million but I don't think
Suppose we got a flat and I get out and fix it.
Some half-baked gunman drives by.
I'd gotta be ready to shoot first.
Oh, I got you.
This is a dangerous part of Texas.
Those outlaws and vagrants they're all here.
Yeah,
I've got a gun.
- You do?
- Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
You got it with you?
No, I don't have it with me.
Well, good I'd hate to try and kiss you and get shot.
Novalyne, look.
Only in Texas do you ever see a sunset like that.
Girl, I hope you appreciate everything I've done for you today.
Now, that's a beautiful sunset if I do say so myself.
- That crazy guy?
- He is not crazy.
He's a writer.
Enid, you're an English teacher you should respect that.
Not what he writes.
I wouldn't touch one of those trash magazines.
He uses words beautifully.
He read me one of his poems the other day.
It was so amazing.
I can't believe how he can
Hey.
Look at that guy across the street.
What on earth is he doing?
Novalyne, come here get a look at this.
Come on.
Now, isn't that the strangest thing you ever did see?
What do you suppose he's doing?
I guess he thinks he's Max
Schmeling or something.
Hey.
Jesus, girl, I almost walloped you.
Yeah, you sure did.
Why ain't you teaching school?
I am I'm on my lunch break.
I just thought I'd say hi.
You almost got a broken nose for your trouble.
Yes, I did.
What were you doing just now with that punching thing?
I got this boxing yarn
I been thinking about going in my head.
Come with me I wanna show you something.
Come on.
So this is your stomping ground, huh?
For now.
Whoa.
How's that after-school play coming along?
Good, we're gonna perform it real soon.
Do you wanna come see it?
Maybe, if I'm not too busy.
Still more a fool I shall appear by the time I linger here.
With one fool's head I came to woo, but I go away with two, sweet adieu.
I'll keep my oath patiently to bear my wroth.
- Very nice.
- Thank you.
You ever directed any Shakespeare?
We do a couple scenes in class, but he's a little bit heavy for this neck of the woods.
You know, when I read his plays,
I can't see that men have changed much since the 1500s.
Men still hate other men.
Well, in the civilization we live in, men become more depraved and demonic all the time.
Oh, it's not that bad.
Girl, when they discovered oil in Cross Plains, you wouldn't believe the scum that moved in here.
- Novalyne, I...
- Thieves, drunkards, wifebeaters, sex deviants not a decent man among them.
What about your father?
He's a good man, isn't he?
You're damn right he is.
He's the only one I know.
What about your friend Clyde and your other friend Truett?
Well, you don't stick to the subject.
You bring up a bunch of irrelevant nonsense to keep yourself from seeing the truth.
Maggots of corruption are all around you.
Hospitals and schools.
- What?
- Hospitals and schools.
They heal, they teach you use them, but you don't give society credit for them?
We men made a hell of a mistake when we sent women to college and gave you the vote.
You just watch it.
See you Friday.
Now that's beauty that's the kind of beauty my ancestors love.
Novalyne, do you think it's possible for a woman to love just one man forever?
I don't know, Bob.
But you know this is the first time I've ever talked about love in the middle of a field during a thunderstorm.
Whew, I'm in the mood to write a love story.
We're here.
Hey, mama.
- Oh, baby.
This is Bob Howard.
Bob's the writer I've been telling you about.
Mama, Mammy.
Howdy, Mammy, nice to meet you.
You too, Bob.
Nice to meet you, too, Mrs. Price.
Welcome, Bob.
Take a seat.
Thank you.
I understand you've been lending a hand with Novalyne's writing hopes.
Well, I been holding it out, but so far she ain't took hold of it.
That is not true.
I listen to every word you say, Bob.
Well, your ears must be keeping it a secret,
'cause your hands ain't been typing it out.
I think Novalyne should teach.
That's what she's good at.
Well, maybe I'll do both.
Well, it don't work that way.
Hey, something smells good in here.
Good deeds in this house do not go unrewarded.
Yes.
Thank you for bringing
Novalyne home, Bob.
Hello, honey how you doing you feel alright?
Hi, my throat's a little sore.
Well, goddamn if you just stayed home like I told you, you'd be feeling fine now.
When will you be up and around?
By Saturday I hope.
And what happens then?
Mayor Adams is throwing a Christmas party, and, Bob, I want you to come with me.
I'm sorry I can't go.
Why not?
I don't have time for some tea drinking, cookie pushing party.
That's not what it is, you bastard.
A bastard.
You calling me a bastard after everything I done for you.
Don't I wear a tie and that goddamn full hat every time we go out.
Bob, you're gonna have to learn how to mix with people.
You can't just...
- If I listened to you my writing would go to hell.
It would not.
Sure it would you're not a writer.
If I wrote like you ill be wasting my damn time.
Scribbling down conversations of every Tod, Dick and jackass I met.
That ain't writing that's copying.
I still want you to go with me.
Aw, Christ I'll see those sons of bitches in hell before I make one of their parties.
You wanna learn to be a writer
I'll show you what it takes.
Mama, the car won't start.
Goddamn bastard.
Dear Novalyne, the French have one gift the ability to gild decay and change the maggots of corruption to the hummingbirds of poetry as demonstrated by this volume.
Hey, what you got there?
It's a book.
Bob sent it to me.
Next time I see him
I'm going to kill him.
You needed to act like whores I swear it.
Why you sacrilegious little hussy.
Do you not fear God's craw?
Is there no honesty anywhere?
And she danced just like the spin of a desert whirlwind, like the leaping of a quenchless flame.
Her white feet spurned the blood-stained deck.
Sweat beaded the forehead of the man facing her, and his eyes were like burning coal.
Smite as he would, he could not break past nor beat down her guard.
She stepped back to draw him out, felt her thighs lock in an iron grip.
His breath came in gusty gulps.
Bob?
You have a phone call.
Hi, it's me.
Novalyne, are you back?
No, I'm still at home.
Merry Christmas, by the way.
Merry Christmas to you too.
Are you still mad at me?
Yes, but not as much.
Hey, Bob, the
Pierre Louis book...
What are you doing now?
Well, not much.
I'm coming over.
Oh, Bob, you don't have to.
Now, you read that book.
No, that book is horrendous.
I can't imagine the fool who wrote it.
A fool?
My Conan yarns are full of sex.
They are?
Hell, yeah.
That's what he did.
Drinking, whoring, fighting what else is there to do in life?
I'm sorry, but I don't see anything sexy about a naked woman dancing around a pirate ship.
You don't?
No.
Well, for God's sakes
I mean she was dancing the mating dance.
I mean what could be more sexy than that?
God I thought she was crazy like you.
Then what do you think would make a sexy story?
Naked women aren't sexy what is, naked men?
I'd look the other way.
You probably would.
A few years ago,
I had a hard time selling sex yarns.
Now I got to work double time just to keep up with the market.
Before long there won't be nothing held back.
Sex will infest everything books, radio, newspapers.
Everything.
Hell, yes.
That's the way it was when Rome fell.
Rape and murder took place on the stage.
Damn people loved it.
I'm sorry I can't come in my mother's...
Expecting her medicine I know.
Here's another
Christmas present.
- Thank you.
- I hope you don't stick this one under the house.
I walked around the
Santa Anna mountains a few days ago, beautiful.
I believe that we carry around the lives of our former ancestors deep in our memories.
You ever read something in history and felt you knew it?
Yeah.
Maybe something bet involving Indians?
Oh, yeah I had this vision of an Indian girl gazing out over the prairie all the time.
Well, there you go.
That's an ancestral memory.
I don't understand why would I have ancestral memories about Indians if there are such things?
Remember during the
Christmas holidays my mother saw you shopping.
She asked me if you had any Indian blood, maybe as much as half Indian?
I wonder why she'd think that.
It's the shape of your face.
Do you know how much
Indian blood you have?
None that I know of.
I bet you got a drop or two.
We are human because our ancestors were human.
That's one thing that persuades me the bible was right.
I can imagine a lot of things, but I can't imagine man was once a monkey.
Hey, have you heard from that writer friend of yours
Lovecourt?
- Lovecraft.
I did get something in the pouch.
Read down in the middle there.
What's it say there, Novalyne?
He says that you are the modern master of fantasy.
Well.
A letter like that makes it worthwhile to be a writer.
Yeah, I see it does.
The next best thing to a Texas sunset is a Texas rain shower.
One of the things life does have to offer a simple thing but a good thing.
Yep.
If you ask me you spend too much time getting them kids ready.
You look worn out.
- I'll be alright.
Well, hell I've got to go out to Temple at the end of the week for my mother's operation.
I don't need another sick girl around.
So soon when are you gonna be back?
I'll stay as long as I have to.
Thanks for the time you've given me, Novalyne.
I've enjoyed every minute with you knowing you.
Well, I look forward to having you back.
Come on wake up.
Come on hard head wake up.
Dr. Howard.
How's Mrs. Howard?
Yep, she's holding her own.
Robert will be alright now.
- Has he been sick too?
- No, no he hadn't.
You really like my son, don't you?
Yeah.
But Bob he...
Robert's real close to his mother.
We're all real close to our mothers.
But we manage to get along without them eventually.
We do.
Robert's a stranger to me, Miss Price.
He's in his own little world most of the time.
I'm not privy to it unlike you.
This one went smooth as silk.
Hell, I can write shoot-em ups.
I got a hankering to write something bigger.
Yeah, a novel, maybe.
Hey, girl.
Let me walk ahead here.
Why?
I got to keep an eye out for rattlesnakes.
- Rattlesnakes?
- Yes.
Don't worry I can handle reptiles, especially giant diamond-back rattlers, two-foot fangs dripping with poison.
Oh, yes.
That is a, oh.
Ah, just joking that's all.
That's enough.
Robert E., you lead on and keep quiet.
It's beautiful.
You can see the whole world from up here.
And others as well.
There you are.
Why don't you tell me about that novel?
Set in Texas.
It's gonna be about the hardships of the early pioneers, and their conflict with the Indians who were trying to save the land they loved.
I figure it'll be the best damn book ever written about frontier life.
It sounds fascinating.
I know what I can do.
No one can write about this country like I can.
I'll be nicer to the
Indians in this novel.
Thank you.
I'll have this beautiful, fully-dressed Indian girl.
The hero will fall in love with her.
He'll be this morose, ungainly misfit among men.
Why does he have to be a misfit?
Why can't he be handsome and kind?
You're still a dreamer, girl.
He's got to be handsome, huh?
Well, to hell with it.
He'll be the most handsome man in the west, with the fastest gun boom, boom, boom.
Christ Almighty slow down, girl.
If you were Mojave I'd have to shoot you for wasting water.
You'd shoot your best girl for that?
I can't help it that's the law of the desert.
I swear why do
I go out with you?
You got me there.
If I was you I'd a high-tailed it away from me a long time ago.
You don't give yourself enough credit.
You have some wonderful qualities.
- Is that so?
- Yeah.
Like what?
Well, your thoughtfulness, your loyalty, your intelligence, humor, imagination.
I could go on and on.
If you don't think a woman is attracted to that you're mistaken.
That's what I see in you.
Well, I...
I appreciate it, girl.
Don't be fooled.
I'm the kind of man that needs to be free.
I can't be tied down.
No, the road I walk I walk alone.
It's funny how women are attracted to that quality as well.
Hi, I'm here to pick up a package.
The name's Truett Vinson.
V-I-N-S-O-N.
Oh, yeah here it is.
Thank you, sir.
Excuse me.
Hi.
- Hi.
Did you say your name was Truett Vinson?
Yes, ma'am.
Well, hi, I'm Novalyne Price.
I believe we have a mutual friend.
- Oh, who's that?
- Bob Howard.
- Bob, really.
- Yeah.
How do you know Bob?
Well, I teach in Cross Plains.
We're friends.
So do you see a lot of Bob up there in Cross Plains?
Off and on whenever he has time.
But you two weren't serious or anything?
Oh, no, no.
He's made it very clear to me many times that he is not the marrying kind.
He has to be free.
The road he walks...
- He walks alone.
Yes.
That's what he says, alright, isn't it?
How often did you go to the movies?
Every now and then.
You think Bob will ever go by himself?
Only if the picture was some wild action movie with lots of sword-fighting and stuff like that you know?
Who is it?
It ain't no tramp.
Hey.
What are you doing here?
I thought you might like to take a ride.
It's
5:30 in the morning.
I know.
Come on, get dressed I got something special to show you something you might appreciate.
Come on.
Hold on.
So, how's your summer been going?
Okay.
We had some rain about a week ago.
Yeah, the farmers sure needed it.
I met Truett
Vinson this weekend.
Oh, yeah, how's he getting along?
Good.
You know, he and Clyde work for the same company.
Poor fool's a bookkeeper.
Pushing papers all day long that's a job you'd never catch me doing.
When's the last time the three of you were together?
Long time.
Too long I ought to give them iron heads a call, see if they don't wanna go out on the prowl.
What exactly do you do out on a prowl?
Drink beer and talk about girls.
Lie about them is more like it.
Don't you talk about any serious subjects?
That is serious.
Sure we do.
We argue plenty.
I wanna wring Clyde's neck sometimes he makes me so mad.
What do you argue about?
You ever read The
Vicar of Wakefield?
Did you like it?
- Yes, I did.
Well, that's too damn bad.
I thought it was the sorriest book I ever read.
I wonder what you'd do if a student told you that.
If he told me I didn't know what I was talking about?
- Right.
- Well, it depends on his attitude.
The vicar was a lousy old bastard.
The villain seduced and raped his daughters, and the old fool took it piously.
No, he had a sweet and generous nature.
He forgave and then he repented his mistakes.
You know I thought you'd say that.
They offer you a spoonful of manure, and you gulp it on down.
- What?
- I know exactly what you'd if a kid disagreed.
You'd bawl him out.
If he was being rude, I would, but if we were just talking about something...
Sure you would.
It's thanks to teachers like you that there's no room for individual thought in schools today.
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.
Oh, really?
Well, yeah, that's right.
Thanks indeed thank God.
If it wasn't for teachers like me, there would be more individuals like you socially inept, hating the world, prattling off pompous ideas that nobody wants to hear in the first place.
Bob Howard, if you do not take some initiative, you are gonna end up a miserable old man sitting at home with no friends and no life.
And another thing.
Don't you ever, ever imply that I do not know how to teach, because then you really are talking about something that you know nothing about.
Now, why don't you run on home?
Your mama's waiting for you.
Novalyne.
Novalyne, get in the car.
- No.
- Get in the goddamn car.
No.
Hell, come on, girl, get in here.
Go away.
I'll keep chasing you all day long.
Now, get in the damn, get in the goddamn car.
Ugh, men.
All men can go to hell.
We are.
Every damn one of us.
Guess who came by my house this morning?
- I don't know who?
- Bob.
He wants me to go down to New Mexico with him.
Do you think Bob knows we're dating?
Mm, yeah, he does now.
Really?
Yeah, I mentioned to him that we met at the post office, and we'd been to the movies a couple times.
What happened was he mad?
No, I don't think so.
Well, Truett, either he was or he wasn't.
Well, he kind of ignored me.
He didn't say a word.
He didn't seem mad.
He asked me if I'd read
The Vicar of Wakefield.
Dear Novalyne, the weather is good.
The beer is lousy.
Hoping you are the same, Bob.
Dear Bob, summer's flying by as it always seems to do.
Where have you been?
I hope you're not still mad at me.
If so, I apologize.
Let me know the next time you'll be coming down, hopefully at a reasonable hour.
Love, Novalyne.
Dear Novalyne, thank you for your invitation to call, but you honestly can't expect me to enjoy ridicule and contempt so much that I'd come back for another dose.
You understand me I think, but I'll make myself clear.
You and Truett haven't played fair with me, concealing the fact that you were going together.
Both of you had plenty of opportunities to tell me, but instead you made a secret of it, and no doubt laughed at me because of it.
Taking advantage of a friend's trust to try and make a fool of him seems a poor triumph,
Robert E. Howard.
- Robert E. Howard.
Obviously, I made a grave error in befriending a pathetic man like yourself, and I now consider my association with you over and finalized.
My only regret is the time wasted spent in your company.
Sincerely, Novalyne Price.
Well, say something.
Seemed like such a nice man.
It's a shame he won't be coming over any more.
Mama, what do you think?
You said it now tear it up.
Why after that hateful letter,
I should tell him to go to hell.
Don't end the friendship, Novalyne.
He's been a good friend.
Why don't you write another letter?
Say what you really wanna say.
Dear Bob, although you leave nothing for me to say, being a woman I'll say something anyway.
During the time I went with you,
I realized perfectly how you felt about women.
Freedom was the first law you recognized.
Strange as it may seem,
I too demand my freedom.
I didn't think you'd resort to middle-class melodrama, and I can't believe that you really in your heart feel that we've betrayed you.
In my last letter,
I was of the opinion that we were still friends, and invited you to call, assuming that our friendship would continue as it had in the past.
I apologize for having made that mistake.
Please know that you will always have my sincere wishes for your continued success and happiness.
Sincerely, Novalyne Price.
Mr. Howard called.
Dr. Howard?
No, Robert Howard.
What'd he say?
He said he'd be over tonight.
Hm, did he want me to call him back and confirm?
No, ma'am.
Well, I am gonna call Mr. Howard and tell him where he can really go tonight.
Mmhmm.
I am.
Believe me straight to hell.
Howdy.
Hi, Bob, how you doing?
Fine.
Everything's fine.
So, what do you think of my buttermilk catcher?
You remember that Kipling yarn you told me about?
Yes.
What was it that girl said?
She said kissing a man without a mustache was like eating eggs without salt.
You like your eggs with salt, don't you?
No, I'll have mine plain.
How are things at home?
Not good.
My mother's getting weaker by the day.
I can never repay her for all she's done for me.
Well, she's not expecting to be repaid.
She believed in my writing from the beginning.
She had faith.
You made her very proud, Bob, but now you've got to lead your own life.
I lead my own life.
Don't think for a second I don't.
I'm thirsty let's go into town.
I made some lemonade.
I want something more substantial.
You got something better to do?
Last month I sold yarns to Action Stories,
Top Notch, and Weird Tales.
I sold a grand old Conan yarn to Mr. Wright.
I think it's the best work I ever done.
Conan is after this hardheaded warrior woman, a real spitfire of a girl.
They find a city that's inhabited by two tribes.
One's ruled by an evil sorceress.
She drains the youth from young, nubile women
Good heavens.
Which the tribe sacrifices in an orgy-like ceremony, stripped naked, chained to a bloody altar.
I would like to go home now.
Orgies and chained naked women my God, Bob.
Aw, hell, you pay too much attention to what people think.
If they don't feed you or put clothes on your back, then what they think ain't worth a damn.
That's right I care.
I care what those people think.
Why did you come here tonight?
Huh, why?
Miss Price, imagine meeting you here.
Hey, how about it nice?
Hey, girl.
- Oh, God.
Jesus, girl, wait up.
What are you in such a hurry for?
- I have to be somewhere.
- Yes, he does.
Well, I'll walk you home.
Heard you and Truett are saving lives these days.
What?
Yeah, I heard you took some people to the hospital after they'd been in an accident.
Yeah, that's true.
Good heavens.
I also hear you took off your jacket so nobody would bleed on it.
It was my new white pigskin jacket.
I didn't wanna ruin it.
Well, I've always said we're really an advancing society when we're so willing to save lives we don't want to endanger our white pigskin jacket.
You make me sound like a monster.
I am not a mean person.
I just didn't want somebody who wasn't really badly hurt bleeding all over my new white pigskin jacket.
If he was bleeding he was hurt.
Oh, shut up,
Bob, just shut up.
Hello, Hemphill residence.
Miss Price, please.
Bob?
Oh, it's you I didn't recognize your voice.
Hi, how've you been?
Good, good.
Hey, would you like to see a show tonight?
Well, I've got an awful lot of work to do tonight.
Come on I just took my suit out.
I'm all dressed up.
Have you shaved that mustache?
Son,
I need you in here.
How's my mama?
Okay, all right.
Here we go.
Here we go.
Come on.
Come on.
Okay.
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
Okay, I'm setting you down now.
Okay.
Thank you.
All right.
Don't you run away.
I'm cold.
Okay.
Let's get this wet thing off.
Okay.
All right, mama, let me get this.
Arms up.
- Okay.
There you go.
Okay, now, you can go ahead and lean back.
Here you go.
Here you go.
Here you go.
Here you are.
Thank you.
There you are.
Are you going out with that little Indian girl tonight?
No, what and leave my best gal?
I don't wanna spoil your evening.
You ain't spoiling it.
Where our life this forever, you'd only too little to give.
But here tonight we sever for life loves life to live.
And the higher a man may travel the lower may he fall.
And the scheme that I must unravel it was never meant for all.
I'm gonna miss you, son.
I'm gonna miss you most of all.
You ain't going nowhere.
Will you stay with me until your father gets home?
And bring that girl around the house sometime.
I'd like to meet her again.
Hi.
So you made it, huh?
I'm sorry.
Something came up.
We're gonna miss our show.
That's all right.
We could drive around for a while if you want.
Okay, that'll be good.
So, what you been up to?
Same old thing.
My students have been a little restless lately.
Oh, yeah?
Well, when you're young you feel the lust for adventure buried in your subconscious.
You don't want to be bothered with dreary things like school.
I see.
How's your mother?
Not well at all.
I can't write or do anything except take care of her.
What do you mean you can't write?
My mother requires my constant care.
She has these terrible night sweats.
I changed her gown three times last night.
That's not your job.
Aw, damn it, you do what needs to be done.
I can't let her lay there wet and uncomfortable.
Why don't you hire a nurse?
You've got the money.
You are not required...
- No, you can't...
- to give up your life.
- Listen to me.
I'm required to give up anything and do whatever needs to be done.
Not your work.
Not your livelihood, Bob.
What's work?
A man can do any kind of work.
Work ain't worth a damn unless you do it for somebody you love.
I'm losing her damn it I know that.
I want a woman to love, a woman to believe in me.
Is that so much to ask?
No, it's not.
It's not.
And I'm sure you'll find one.
You're an extraordinary man.
If you don't love me, say so.
I know you loved me once.
I believe in you, Bob, I do.
I do.
And do you love Truett?
If it's Truett you love, say so.
Say it, goddamn you.
Say it.
I don't love anyone.
I don't love anyone at all.
I don't love anyone.
I did love you but you weren't ready.
You told me so yourself.
You said, "I can't be tied down."
You said so yourself.
- Well, I didn't know what I was talking about.
I know but there's other reasons too.
We have all these differences and they're gone be there.
But differences can be overcome, can't they?
Yeah.
Yeah, they can.
Tell me that you'll change your attitude.
Tell me that you'll get out once in a while, and that you'll try to let go of your mother.
Tell me that now.
Bob, tell me that now.
I'm going to Louisiana
State this summer.
I've been accepted.
You made good with your writing, and I'm gonna make good with something too.
I'm gonna teach.
Oh.
You dedicate yourself to kids in some small, apathetic town what will you get out of it?
Not even a thank you.
I'm not doing it to be thanked.
Well, you got a great cause.
To make life worth living a man or a woman you got to have a great love or a great cause.
I have neither.
Don't say that that's not true.
That's a colorful sweater you got there.
It's an LSU sweater.
The other teachers gave it to me so I'd be ready when I got there.
Hell, I know you'll be ready.
Question is will they be ready for a spitfire like you?
I'm sure they've seen their share of spitfires.
I don't know about that.
Texas spitfires and
Louisiana spitfires are two entirely different breeds.
Hmm.
Come on get in I'll take you for a drive.
Suppose you were a lonely, beautiful girl who came out here to take in the sunset.
While you were watching it a handsome Indian brave stepped out of them trees there.
Now, what you do about it would be the yarn that you'd write.
See I can imagine the sunset, and I can see the Indian brave, but that's as far as I go.
That's where the story ends.
Why stop when it just gets interesting?
Because the next thing you know,
I'd be telling him to wash off the war paint and get a good suit of clothes and accompany me to Sunday School.
Something tells me he just wouldn't wanna do that.
When I saw that house,
I thought about the yarns that you write.
Your dream.
The dream that brought you over to my house that day.
Bob.
Thanks for bringing me out here, and thanks for telling me what's wrong with my stories.
I mean that.
Well, you're welcome.
It's only my opinion you don't have to listen to it if you don't want to.
I'd be a fool not to listen to the greatest pulp writer in the whole wide world,
Robert E. Howard.
Well, that you would by God.
That you would.
- Uh-huh.
- Let's ride.
Now, you be sure to write.
You know my address old lock box 313.
I'll write as soon as I get settled.
Don't you get into any trouble with those wild ideas of yours.
You run into any of that voodoo, you make sure you find a Catholic, hold up a cross say a prayer for you.
Okay, I will.
Hey, girl.
Take a look at that sunset I ordered for you.
I sure do appreciate it.
That morning the attending physician,
Dr. Dill had told us that Mrs.
Howard would never recover.
Robert looked at me, and he went to his room and he began to type.
A minute later our cleaning lady saw him walk through the back door to his car.
She said he raised his arms and began praying, then she heard a shot and saw him slumped over the steering wheel.
I carried my boy back into the house.
He lived for eight hours.
His mother passed away the next day.
Thank you for the time you gave my son, Miss Price.
I know how much he cared for you.
Fiveminute stop, folks.
You've been doing a lot of crying.
Who you crying for?
A friend.
Gone, is he?
Passed on?
Yes.
He took his own life.
That's tough.
He was a writer.
He made his living writing stories.
Could spin a yarn, could he?
That's what he called them.
What's your name, dear?
Novalyne Price.
Let me ask you something, Novalyne.
Are you glad you had the chance to know him?
And even though you won't see him for a while, is he still your friend?
Yeah.
Yeah, he sure is.
Novalyne, look.
It's gonna be a beautiful sunrise.
Imagine an end to crime...
...an end to poverty.
Imagine 2 million good jobs waiting to be filled.
Sounds like a dream, doesn't it?
Well, sometimes dreams come true.
Delta City.
For our children.
This is Media Break. You give us three minutes, we'll give you the world.
Good evening, I'm Casey
Wong. Our top story tonight:
Motor City goes Japanese as the Omni
Consumer Products Corporation...
...ended months of speculation today by announcing its takeover...
...by the multinational
Kanemitsu Corporation.
Come on, honey, hurry up with your calculus. It's almost time for bed.
I'm watching Media Break.
the first private corporation to completely own and operate a major city.
Company spokesmen express special interest...
...in the issues of urban resettlement...
...and a crime wave in Detroit that many citizens are calling a war zone.
But as usual, OCP has an answer.
Meet the Rehabs, Urban rehabilitation officers.
From the blazing fields of the Amazon War...
...comes state-of-the-art urban pacification.
We're here to help the people, augment the police force and deal with the gang problem.
What about reports you're actually evicting people...
...to make way for construction of Delta City?
Nikko, you heard your mom. Go on.
Oh, man.
- And the homeless?
- What a gyp.
Some buildings have to come down before Delta can go up.
I won't deny we're serving an eviction notice or two...
...but most of these people have already taken their urine tests and placement exams.
They've got new jobs waiting for them.
We're just helping them make the transition, that's all.
- We're cops, nothing more. - Nothing more?
Well, we're not robots, if that's what you mean.
Hey, Dad?
You're supposed to be asleep.
Is it true what the Tv said?
That it's a war zone outside?
Don't listen to what the Tv says.
This is your home, you hear me?
And you're safe here.
I'll buy that for a dollar!
Get out, get out, get out!
This neighborhood is the property of omni Consumer Products.
- For God's sake, help us!
- That's what we're here for, ma'am.
Just get on the bus.
Where are they taking us, Dad? What's happening?
Don't believe them! They'll throw us into the streets to die like rats!
Nazi sons of bitches!
Shoot her if you must, but get her out of here.
Yes, sir.
Let's go. Come on.
I think it's going rather well, don't you?
Yes, sir.
Come on, I said, move! Move!
- Manandle an old lady, would you?
- Shut up!
- Move, move!
- Get up there!
I said, get up!
What are you doing down there? Piece of slime!
Can you hear me?
I said, get up, you drunken cow!
Get back! The crane's gonna blow!
Listen to me, people! These buses are going nowhere!
Stay here! Fight for your homes! There is no silver lining!
Only corporate scumbags who want to line their pockets!
Nikko! Nikko!
Mom! Mom! Dad!
Nikko! No! That's my baby! Nikko, Nikko!
Mom! Dad! Dad!
Mom, Dad!
Mom!
Mom!
Dad?!
Mom!
You! Stay where you are!
Repeat: The rehabilitation officers are here to assist you.
It's okay, it's okay.
You're with us now.
Is he gone?
Are we clear?
Clear!
Okay, let's do it.
Okay, Moreno.
Cover your ears.
Rock 'r roll.
All clear. Let's go.
Jesus!
- ED 209!
- He wasrt in the recon photo!
Freeze! You are trespassing on police property.
Please surrender your weapons.
- What the hell?
- Is she crazy?
You have 20 seconds to comply.
- Hey, kid, come back here!
- You're gonna get us all killed!
What the hell is she doing?
You are in direct violation of penal code 114, section 3.
I am authorized to use physical force.
You now have 10 seconds to comply.
You won't believe this.
He'll be loyal as a puppy.
You have five seconds. Four seconds.
Three seconds. You have one second to comply.
I am now authorized to...
...be loyal as a puppy.
Damn!
Will it work?
Stole it off a dead cop.
Holy shit! That's the police armory!
- They deleted the access signature.
- Let's get out of here!
They'll be a few minutes. Let's figure out how to open that door!
Are you kidding me?
One-stop shopping.
- Let's go! Gotta get out of here!
- He's right. Let's ride.
- What are you, picking out drapes?
- Coming!
- Get that.
- Why?
It looks expensive.
Come on! Come on, let's go!
Drop your weapons now!
Do it! Drop them!
Freeze! You're trespassing on police property.
Eat lead, suckers!
Nikko, get in! Come on!
What can I do for you?
Nobody move!
Everything in the register! Now! Do it!
What's it like being a rocket scientist?
All units, we have a B and E involving police property, please respond.
Repeat, all units, we have a...
Hey, Donnelly, it's your turn.
- No way. We went last time.
- No, it's Lewis' turn.
Lewis, you're up.
Lewis! Lewis! Lewis!
Isn't anybody gonna arrest me, or what?!
- Where's your friend Murphy?
- He's not big on doughnuts.
- He's not big on doughnuts.
- I knew that.
All units, repeat, that is a battered yellow van.
No plates. Tracking shows southbound...
- That's a battered yellow van.
- No shit, Sherlock.
Moreno, company's coming!
Hold on. Here we go.
Unit 477 in pursuit, eastbound, Esposito.
Watch it!
I'm watching it!
Jesus!
They're still on our tail.
Don't sweat it.
Hey, kid. Watch this.
Hold the champagne.
You stopped in the middle of the street!
- That was my light!
- You idiot!
- Is everybody okay?
- Okay? What are you, a comedian?
I traded in a brand new SUX for this classic. Now look at it!
It's garbage. It's going to the junkyard.
What is this, fellas? You give a broad a badge and she gets delusions of gander.
It's "grandeur," dumbshit.
This new guy is making me nervous.
I don't think this is exactly a guy.
You think it's him?
Unit 477 to dispatch.
This is 477 to dispatch.
Come in, dispatch.
We could use some backup out here.
Hello, dispatch. Come in.
This is 477 to dispatch.
Lewis.
Splatterpunks.
Wait a second, what do you need the shotgun for?
Shit, we're all gonna die.
- Sit tight, people. Backup's coming.
- Sit tight?
If it wasrt for you, I wouldn't even be here, you dumb broad.
I'll make you a deal, tough guy.
You want to eat the tie, keep it up.
Take it easy. My brother's a cop.
477 to dispatch, code 3! We're low on ammo and need immediate backup!
Right now!
Sergeant Reed.
I got Murphy's cruiser on the grid.
- He just turned around.
- He what?!
Murphy, this is Reed.
I have three other vehicles en route to Lewis.
Murphy, continue pursuit! That is a direct order! Do I make myself clear?
Murphy, are you listen...?
Police officer. No loitering.
You called for backup?
Thanks for dropping by, Murphy.
Are they gone?
I'm still scanning three.
Make that two.
Block it! Megazone invasion!
Pop a tranq, hypo-head.
Splatterville's ours.
Shoot him in the mouth.
Cyborg eats bullets, Jock.
Not tonight he don't.
Hit him in the mouth!
- Shut up!
- Do it! Do it!
- Do it! Do it!
- Shut up!
Nice try, creeps.
Give me it!
You have the right to remain silent.
Down there.
Jesus, Murphy, are you okay?
I'm fine, Anne.
Thank you for asking.
Come on, come on!
Let's go! Everything will be all right.
Get your damn hands off me!
Stupid kid.
- Come here. Come on.
- Would you forget the stupid kid already?!
Kanemitsu-san...
...I realize we've had setbacks...
...but we've done everything possible to get Delta City back on schedule.
Gentlemen...
...you are now looking at a company...
...in transition.
Needless to say, this has resulted in the implementation of certain...
...well...
...let's call them...
..."cutbacks. "
But who can put a price tag on a dream?
Our esteemed former chairman had a dream.
He called it Delta City.
Knock it off, Johnson.
The great city of Detroit represents an important precedent, gentlemen.
There's only one small problem.
It's turning into a war zone!
It's just a small resistance group.
There's no reason to believe they pose a significant threat.
I'd consider...
...a deficit of 350 million dollars a significant threat.
Wouldrt you?
- Fleck!
- Sir.
You're in charge of
Security Concepts.
Where's that Robocop we spent so much money on?
The police had a problem with the unit. I'm dealing with it personally.
You do that.
Get him to the Rehab Team...
...and maybe we won't have to worry about a "small resistance group. "
Get the hell out of here, all of you!
You take your time.
And for God's sake, Fleck...
...try to get the police on our side.
What if I don't want a robot on my team?
You've got 4 days, McDaggett.
If Cadillac Heights isn't cleared for demolition Friday midnight...
...our loans will be called in. OCP will be ruined.
We made a deal, didn't we, chum.
Oh, by the way...
...if you're just figuring out the line between big business and war...
...is a little blurry...
...then you're further over the hill than they say.
This is entrapment! My client was visiting close friends in that motel.
Hey, buddy. Your client's friends...
...were a non-union video crew and a German shepherd.
That's prejudicial.
Did the arresting officer ask to see their union cards?
Come get this crap. Will someone answer the damn phone?!
Metro West. No, ma'am, we're not on strike.
You could have fooled me. I'll deal with those looters myself.
Get me a baseball bat with some nails in it.
How are you feeling?
I've been better.
To be honest, it looks like you just made friends with a Mack truck.
I don't have many...
...friends.
Dr. Lazarus.
- You want to tell me what happened?
- Atlanta beat the Pistons last night.
- That's cute. I meant with glory boy.
- Oh, him.
He got shot to hell and set on fire.
You know what I'm talking about.
He disobeyed a direct order. Why?
- My real opinion?
- No, lie. Make up a story.
Well, Mr. Fleck...
...offhand...
...I'd say the only reason he'd disobey an order is if...
...he didn't agree with it.
Excuse me?
He made a decision.
His friend was in trouble, he made a judgment call. Cops do that.
Human cops. What do you mean,
"his friend"? It's a machine.
Look, if oCP just wanted a robot, why'd they put Murphy in there in the first place?
Murphy's dead, sweetheart, that's on record.
Mr. Fleck, this is Murphy!
What's left of his face, his cerebrum, his cerebellum.
Human tissue that's still alive.
How can you interface human and machine...
...then complain when the human part makes a decision?
So not only did we get
Murphy's years of training...
...and his law-enforcement skills, we also inerited...
...his memories, his feelings, his emotional baggage?
Well, I'd call it his humanity, but
I don't think you know that word.
I see.
You talked me into it. His emotions: Get rid of them.
Find their location and erase them.
If it wipes out his memory, too bad.
We could cut out the appropriate circuits by...
...implanting a micro-neuro-barrier.
Do it.
I got news for you. I don't give a shit how smart you are.
OCP owns the cops. That means they own him, and they own your cute little ass.
Nobody owns me.
Fine.
We want him on the Rehab Team.
That means you make him predictable, or look for a new job, sweet cheeks.
I think I'm in love.
What's going through your head?
That's his family.
Want me to install the neuro-barrier, doctor?
No, I can do it.
I think I'd like to be alone with him, if it's all right.
Alex, I thought you'd never get home.
Don't let the fact that these people are homeless sway you.
They're terrorists, pure and simple.
On the screens are suspected rebel locations.
If these locations appear on your regular beat, check it out.
Make sure you report any unusual findings...
Hear what they did to Murphy?
Murphy.
Lewis, you want your body armor?
What? No, I'm off duty.
What's up, anyway?
Do you have family?
Yeah, I have a brother in Pittsburgh, the one who never calls. You know that.
Robo, are you okay?
I'm fine.
And call me Murphy.
Murphy?
Step out of the building.
Stay right there.
We're police officers.
We don't want you.
We believe there are squatters in there. Now step away from the door.
They're civilians. They're just trying to stay warm!
Those people belong in the nearest rehabilitation center.
Some are terrorists. Step away or you will be cited for obstructing justice.
I'm not going to ask politely next time.
Step away from the door.
This is your final warning.
You are making a mistake.
- Back off, or there'll be trouble.
- Now you're talking, Murphy.
We're not budging. If you wanna get in, you'll have to shoot through us.
I don't have a huge problem with that.
Cease fire!
Robocop.
Come on, come on, come on!
Come with us!
Cover me.
Some tough cop I am. Huh, partner?
I'm scared.
Don't be.
It won't hurt long.
Get them for me.
Promise me.
I promise.
Murphy.
Officer down.
Move it!
We don't have much time.
Nikko, let's go.
Come on. Come with us.
Is she crazy? He's a cop! He's one of them!
He's on our side now.
She's right. You saw what he did.
You'll let a stupid kid make our decisions?
- We're at war. We can use his help.
- Are you kidding me? Look at him!
He is totaled, man!
People, come on. We don't have time for this shit.
He's right.
We should go.
Five-meter spread.
Search the perimeter.
Damn.
- We're tracking him, sir. He's moving.
- Impossible. The building is surrounded.
He's gone underground.
Find a manole.
We got a little held up.
Rats?
One or two.
Go on through.
Are you okay?
I'm fine.
Hey!
You guys!
Oh, man!
I told you it was a mistake to bring him.
I bet he weighs a ton.
Watch your step.
All right.
Clear the way.
- Get out of the way.
- Hold up your side.
He don't look good.
You wouldn't look so good either if you took a grenade in your chest.
Tracking.
- Beacon.
- Tracking?
He'll lead them right to us!
Shut up, Coontz!
What's he talking about?
- Did he booby-trap the 8th
Street entrance? - Maybe.
Better get mobilized, folks.
They got a little too close to home that time.
It's not won'th it.
It's not won'th this shit!
You better take a real deep breath right now, Coontz.
Because if you don't think it's won'th it...
...then you're nothing but excess baggage. Do you hear me?!
You get it together, Coontz.
Cadillac Heights may not be much, but it's our home.
It's all we got.
If you don't think our homes is won'th it, then tell me what the hell is.
This is Bertha to Base op. We're coming in.
Set an extra place.
We're bringing in a friend.
Incoming caller.
What do you want?
Nice work, dollface.
What you talking about?
You haven't heard?
You might want to turn on Media Break.
Tv on, channel 378.
Witness to the tragic shooting was
Rehab Commander, Paul McDaggett.
All I can say is it's a terrible loss of a fine public servant.
It's hard to believe that she was gunned down by her own partner.
An OCP spokesperson has confirmed...
...that Robocop has joined the terrorist rebel forces.
He is heavily armed and should be considered extremely dangerous.
Tv off.
Congratulations, sweet cheeks. Now listen up. I want your legendary ass...
...and your corporate
I.D. Card in my office...
...by 7:00 a. m. Tomorrow. And maybe you won't be brought up on charges.
Meantime, you might want to decide whose side you're on.
Sleep tight.
- He what?
- Shot at Rehabs and went underground.
- There goes our P.R. Budget.
- Company line is he's gone renegade.
- How'd the CEo take it?
- How do you think?
Between me and you, I think the CEo's losing it.
I mean, take a look around, will you?
It's the Fall of Rome around here.
It's Darwin time, you know what I'm saying?
Survival of the least expendable.
Remember the old man.
Everyone's expendable.
It can't be that bad.
Honey, can you hear me?
Are you there?
Every corporation goes through this sort of thing.
Oh, my God, what happened?
What's happening?
Arnott just went out the window.
- That's the fourth one this month.
- Chickenshit.
I'd eat a bullet myself.
Less showy.
The writing was on the wall the minute we hopped...
...in the sack with that shitty Kanemitsu corporation.
As I was saying...
...we have a warrant out for Robocop's arrest.
If we can eliminate him, then we'll find that the squatters are more...
...let's say, easily persuaded.
Fleck. A word with you, son.
I'm sorry for the intrusion, sir.
Anything Security Concepts can do?
Security Concepts can kiss my freckled butt. You're fired.
You heard me! You're fired. Get out of here.
Three days until disaster.
What the hell will I tell my shareholders?
What about more Rehabs, sir?
We could recruit them out of the Police Department.
It would be cheaper than mercenaries...
...and we could use the Metro
West facility as a staging area.
Give them a nominal raise for an incentive.
You're a good man, Johnson.
I knew there was a reason
I made you a vice president.
Thank you, sir.
I really...
Heads up!
Come on, let's go.
We're gonna be late!
Well?
Can you fix him?
This isn't a valve job on a Chevy.
I never worked on a damn Robocop before.
- I can do the body work, but...
- Look...
...we gotta hang on to the
Heights for three more days.
- He can hold out till then, can't he?
- Are you listening to me?!
He's messed up. We don't have the equipment.
Who the hell does?!
Lazarus.
Find doctor...
...Lazarus.
Who are you?
I'm friends with Robocop.
Well, he's not here. I'm sorry.
You don't believe me.
To tell you the truth, I don't know what to believe anymore.
He had a message for you.
He said to thank you for not taking his memories away.
Well, well, well.
Afraid you're a little late, pal.
You must be one of Kanemitsu's boys.
I'm impressed.
Trouble is...
...your boss...
...he kind of owns oCP.
And oCP's kind of on our shitlist with a bullet!
So you want to know where the rebels are?
You can tell your bosses to kiss my ass!
A vehicle is approaching.
How you doing, Murphy?
I've been better.
- Give me a status scan.
- Organics intact.
Systems efficiency: 23 percent.
Looks like a direct hit to the heart.
We have to recalibrate the pneumatic system.
Is he gonna die?
Not if I can help it.
Let's get everything hooked up to the generator.
We've got work to do.
I'm going to unplug you for a little while.
Don't worry, everything's gonna be okay.
Here you go.
I got that heart you wanted.
I said a Nissan. That's a Kanemitsu.
Zack, we need that sealant! Zack!
Marie! Marie! Look!
Oh, shit.
Bring me that chest plate over here.
You wait, man.
You are gonna be so cherry.
Moreno, watch out for the...
What the hell are you doing?
I didn't know that thing was there!
- Don't yell at me!
- Well, don't do it.
Murphy.
It's you.
Alex, I thought you'd never get home.
Welcome home, Murphy.
I couldn't sleep.
How are you feeling?
My efficiency rate is 93 percent.
Anything above 90 is considered normal.
I heard Marie call you Murphy.
Is that your real name?
It was...
...before...
Before what?
So...
Now that you're better, will you stay?
Will you help us?
You know what Bertha says. If we hold back the Rehabs for two more days...
...they can't make us move.
And they'll have to let my parents go.
We'll all be together like family again.
Your parents?
Murphy? You okay?
Your parents, you miss them?
Yeah.
But...
...you remember them.
Because...
...if you remember them...
...they're never really gone.
Hey, Murphy...
...I'm glad your new heart works.
I heard voices.
She should be in bed.
Could you leave her...
...just a moment?
Of course.
You gotta pay for that.
What are you, deaf?
Son of a...
That's not what we said.
It's not what we said we were gonna do!
Bertha, you said to relocate the weapons...
...but where do you want this thing?
Oh, my God.
How did you get this?
We stole it from the police depot. Why?
This looks like the exhaust system from an F-27.
No. It's the prototype for Robo's flight pack.
The funding ran out before we got a chance to test it.
- How do you know so much about it?
- I designed it.
Well, looks like the odds on the home team just went up.
What I've done is programmed the command system...
...to take its cues from your hard drive.
I've also rigged it to work as an auxiliary power unit.
So if you ever have a power drain like yesterday...
...just interface with the flight pack and recharge whether you fly or not.
Nikko, see those resistors over there?
Get them for me, will you?
Get them for me, will you?
Get them for me.
Promise me.
Get them for me.
Promise me.
What's going on?
Excuse me.
Hey, where you going?
Unfinished business.
It's okay. He'll be back.
He needs us too.
Where's he going?
To keep a promise.
You got a Robocop.
You got an alien cop?
- Got a ghost cop?
- I don't have time for...
You got a vampire cop?
- Murphy.
- Good evening, Sergeant Reed.
Do you know there's a warrant out for your arrest?
Yes.
I was just checking.
What can I do for you?
Please direct me to the Rehab Staging Area.
It's down the hall.
You can't miss it.
Thank you.
You may want to call the fire department.
- You got a light?
- Sure, man.
Allow me, scum.
Oh, shit.
Where's McDaggett?
That does not look like a police station.
You're damn right I'm not at the station.
If my spy hadrt warned me, I'd be dead now.
I thought your damn ninja was supposed to take care of Robocop.
That's the deal. I clear the area, he keeps the robot off my back.
You have the device I sent you?
It hasn't come to that yet. And it won't. Relax.
It is difficult for me to continue our business relationship...
...when I don't know your methods.
You don't need to know my methods.
I said I'll clear the area and I'll clear it.
Just get the robot cop off my back.
I understand you're willing to pay good money to know where the rebel base is.
Yes, well...
...the money's good...
...if the tip's good.
The last tip saved your ass, didn't it?
What do we have here?
You don't like men in uniform?
My dad lost his job.
I just need some money.
- We've got lots of money, honey.
- Don't.
- No!
- She said, "No. "
Maybe you have a hearing problem?
Go home, young lady.
You are in violation of curfew.
Where's McDaggett?
Room 212.
Thank you.
I hope you are insured.
Elevator door sticks!
Don't.
I have a message from officer Lewis.
Stop!
Drive!
I said, drive, goddamn it, drive!
My time, my money. I told you and won't tell you again, understand?
I must commandeer your vehicle for police use.
What is your problem, sucker?
I mean, officer.
Cover me.
Commander!
What's the deal?
Where the hell is Robocop?
We could drive around and listen for explosions.
Are you doing that?
I got tired of splicing wires, so I put in a pulse tach decoder.
- Telemetric?
- No.
- Smart ass.
- I know you are, but what am I?
Here, let me try.
Thanks for the heart attack.
I believe I will go and send out a recon team.
I got a better idea.
Why don't we just all have a seat.
And relax.
It'll all be over in a few minutes.
You son of a bitch.
Watch the language, there's children present.
Drop it, Coontz.
I'm not going to ask twice.
What do you mean, "it'll all be over in a few minutes"?
Get the kids out of here! Now!
Bertha!
Go.
- Got to get her.
- Go!
Come on, let's go! Come on!
Come on.
Come on! Get in! Come on!
Come on!
Okay, now go!
- Go on!
- No, it's happening again!
Don't let them take you away.
I said, go! Get out of here!
Where is he?
Go to hell.
Take her to headquarters.
I promise my men won't leave a mark on you.
Sir. What about our friend Coontz?
If we'd let him live, we'd have to have paid him.
We're talking about hundreds of thousands of dollars in damage.
- Murphy can be rough on properties.
- Yeah. Well...
...every cent of it will be coming out of your salaries.
Hey! You built him!
We're taking Cadillac Heights.
I'll need 50 of your men armed and in full body armor in one hour. Johnson...
...tell the CEo the demolition crews will have access at 0600 hours tomorrow.
Hey, we don't do that kind of work.
That was a direct order, sergeant.
Driving people out of their homes is no work for a cop!
Now, sergeant.
Fifteen years on the force is quite an investment.
Your job, your pension.
Maybe instead of worrying about these squatters, think about your own family.
I am.
I'm thinking I have to go home and face them.
You can't do this.
You are employees of oCP!
Now remember that.
You're jeopardizing your retirement benefits!
Stop that man.
How would you and your friends like to make some money?
- It's...
- Johnny...
- Rehab!
- Hurray!
Johnny Rehab action figures, parts and accessories all sold separately.
Three nuns and five clergy are dead...
...in what is believed to be the latest atrocity by the killer cyborg, Robocop.
The OCP claim the former police unit...
...is responsible for a spree of terrorism...
...in the Cadillac Heights section of Old Detroit.
I'm sorry, I can't even read this.
This is bullshit!
Are you buying this?
Are you kidding me? Robocop?
Marie.
Lousy sons of bitches!
- OCP bastards! - Nobody is listening to you, sweetheart.
We are in position.
This is Big Stick. You have a green.
Arm and proceed to strike zone.
All teams, we have a green.
All teams, we have a green.
Hey, take it easy.
- So what now?
- What now?
- Game's over, Moreno. Just shut up.
- What about Bertha's plan?
Damn it! Bertha's dead!
I'm sorry.
Folks, in about 45 minutes...
...the Rehabs are coming to blow you out of your neighborhood.
I want you to take your kids...
...and anybody who shouldn't be fighting to the basement!
The rest of you are hereby deputized by the Detroit Police Department.
It's time to show how real cops kick ass.
Detroit Police! Identify yourself.
You are under arrest for assaulting an officer.
And destruction of police property.
Quiet!
Quiet!
Hold your fire until absolutely necessary.
Commander...
...Detroit Police are out there, sir. They're fighting against us.
So? We have a schedule to keep.
We don't fire on police officers!
You're out of line, McDaggett.
I'm in charge here.
I'm pulling the plug.
Sit down.
Have you gone war-wacky?
I said, sit down.
Good idea.
How are we getting out of here anyway?
How'd you get...? Never mind.
Is there a transmission dish outside?
Yeah, and I was just watching the Media Break guy pick his nose.
Do you have your computer with you?
People of Detroit...
...this is an illegal broadcast.
It may be cut off at any time.
So listen to me.
OCP is lying to you.
They're destroying people's lives for big business.
Those Rehabs you see on TV...
...they're mercenaries hired by OCP to throw people out of their homes.
You've got to believe me.
I'm speaking for all the homeless and jobless citizens of this city...
...and every city like it run by heartless capitalist scumbags...
OCP doesn't care about people. OCP cares about...
Your neighborhood is next unless you fight back now.
Time's running out.
OCP's the enemy.
I repeat. Time is running out. OCP is the enemy.
Help us. Innocent people are dying.
- More ammo!
- More ammo!
Zack's hit!
They're winning, aren't they, sergeant?
What in the name...?
Sir?
Splatter that, you sons of bitches!
Come in, Big Stick.
All right, Mr. Robocop.
Come and get me.
Get away from the door.
Think it over.
Oh, my God, Johnson, our stock has dropped to nothing.
We're ruined.
How may I help you, officer?
By resisting arrest.
Don't count on it, chum.
Anyway, what's the charge?
The murder of Anne Lewis.
Dead or alive, you're coming with me.
McDaggett, you can have oCP.
It's all yours. Sayonara.
Where're you going?
You're gonna miss all the fun.
No flashy bravery, tin man.
Or the two cuties say, "Bye-bye. "
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Stop them! Stop them!
Stupid fools!
Don't you know what you've done to us?!
Those androids are programmed with a thermal fail-safe device.
You mean to self-destruct?
In 15 seconds, everything within 20 yards...
...of where we're standing will be atomized.
We're dead, you stupid slag.
Don't count on it, chum.
Hang on.
- Come on.
- Let me give you a hand.
Kanemitsu-san...
...I realize that it looks bad...
...but maybe our plans were over-ambitious.
Let's start a skoshy bit smaller.
Let's gentrify this neighborhood. Build strip malls.
Fast-food chains. Lots of popular entertainment. What do you think?
- What did he say?
- You're fired.
I got to hand it to you.
What do they call you?
Murphy, is it?
My friends call me Murphy.
You call me...
...Robocop.
Sometimes, I think about what we must sound like to God.
How does He know who's in trouble and needs help?
How did He know to come to us?
What you are about to see is true.
The names have not been changed... because nobody believes me anyway.

Let the church say, "Amen."
Look at this, Osbert.
Ninety-six dollars and a button.
Button! Who would put a button in the collection...?
Oh.
- Times are hard, Saul.
- The church can't pay its bills on that.
Amen.
Beloved, in our exploration of the text today...
I would like to talk to you about temptation.
Mm-hmm.
Amen.
And not just the kind you find in the liquor store or someone else's bed.
I'm talking about temptation of the soul.
Mm-hmm.
The kind that just kinda, kinda... kinda creeps up on you without you even knowing it.
- But God knows.
- % God knows%
God is that little voice inside that says, "Don't give in."
% Don't give in%
- Don't give up.
- % Don't give up%
Be gone, temptation!
He knows you're tired.
That's why He says,
"Lean on me."
% Lean%
- % Lean%
- Aw.
He knows you're tempted.
That's why He says,
"Grab on to me... and together we will rise above."
Amen.
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
If I didn't know any better,
I'd say you... thought I needed some help in there.
Well, when I realized you were doing one of Daddy's old sermons...
I thought maybe you did.
I was... hoping that he could make a difference, even if I can't.
If you ask me, you did even better than he did.
Really.
I appreciate your support, honey.
Father, forgive me.
I'd like to talk to you about temptation.
The kind that creeps up on you.
And that's me, Jeremiah.
Are you after Daddy's job already?
Well, this is the story.
My didn't-make-it-up story.
- It was one week before Christmas.
- Come on.
The Christmas
I learned all about miracles.
I asked Santa Claus to bring me a brother for Christmas.
Well, Santa doesn't make those kinds of deliveries, baby.
Oh.
Can Hakim have lunch with us?
Well, I think Hakim's grandma might want him around today, you know?
But he's my best friend.
Well, maybe she won't miss him for a while.
- But then you and I are going downtown, okay?
- Okay.
- Be careful crossing the street.
- I will.
- Look both ways.
- Hakim!
- Don't wake his grandma.
- Hakim!
Come on, come on!
Hurry up! All right!
Let's play, Jeremiah!
Okay.
Let's build a snowman.
Come on over here.
Come on over here.

Child, I'm the only help in this house.
- Mmm, mmm, mmm.
- Now that was a lovely sermon.
Even better the second time.
Mama, please.
I told you about smoking in the house.
You shouldn't be smoking at all.
Well, there's a lot of things
I shouldn't be doing at all.
Oh, poor Hakim.
Bad enough his mama ran out, but to leave him with his grandma.
Bessie Adams can't take care of no five-year-old!
You know that woman's two days older than dirt!
Well, she won't have to much longer.
- Child Welfare's gonna take him now.
- What?
Julia, they're closing the youth center today.
I have to say good-bye to the kids.
What is his problem?
There is no problem, Ma.
Yeah, and I'm the Queen of the Nile!
Julia, something's been going on in this house for months now.
I can hear it in your voice over the phone.
- Mom, maybe you've been dialing the wrong number.
- Oh, yeah?
Well, somebody just better get their house in order. That's all I know.
- Well, don't look at me, Ma, okay?
- I'm lookin' at you!
All right. Well, Mama, you can look at me from behind.
Girl, don't be talkin' to me about your behind. I gave you that behind!
I don't even know why I bother wearing this.
It's not doing anyone any good.
And neither am I.
Lord...
I know You're especially busy this time of year, but...
I'm just a little tired.
If You get a moment,
I sure could use some help.
- Mine's bigger!
- Mine's bigger!
- Mine's much bigger!
- Mine's bigger!
Why did you throw snow at me?
It's all down my neck!
Wow.
- Huh?
- Where'd you come from?
You okay?
No.
You okay?
No. Aaaaaaah!
Hide, run, Hakim, run!
- Wait a... Wait a minute!
- Quick, hurry!
- Here. Hide here.
- I'm here! I'm here!
I'm here!
Thank You, Dear God.
Thank You.
I'm here!
- What's he doing?
- Huh?
I'm here!
I'm here!
Ma, it's a snowman.
A real one!
Joe Hamilton's tearin' down everything. Why's he doin' it?
Yeah, man, where're we supposed to chill at now?
They're tryin' to see us get locked up or shot or something.
Listen to me, listen. It just means you've got to work that much harder... try that much harder to stay out of trouble.
- I'm gonna do my thing.
- Peace, man.
- I'm sorry.
- Where are we supposed to go now?
- I don't know, man.
- You did your best, pastor.
Yeah, you tried.
- Thank you, son.
- Bye.
- Y'all take care of yourselves.
- What do you want to do?
- I don't know.
- Well, it's too cold to stay out.
Tough break, huh?
Kinda seems like they're all tough these days.
You Henry Biggs?
- Yes, I'm the pastor over at St. Matt's.
- Bingo!
Every Friday, 8:00.
- My name's Dudley.
- Nice to meet you, Dudley.
- Pleasure.
- You a reporter?
- No. No, no.
- Social worker?
- No, I'm here in answer to your request.
- My request?
For help?
Is this some kind of joke?
Uh, no, no.
He doesn't make jokes.
He?
Capital "H", capital "E".
I want you to know that together the three of us... can help get you through this little crisis you're having.
- Look, I don't know who you are.
- Dudley, I'm Dudley.
- Or who put you up to this.
- He did.
But I'm afraid you picked the wrong day for me to be a good sport.
- Now, will you excuse me?
- Sure.
- Thank you.
- Wow.
I'm sorry.
I'll, uh... try another approach.
- Ho, ho, ho.
- Thank you, sister. Merry Christmas.
I've been waitin' a long time for this.
- Yeah?
- Yes, sir.
Mmm.
Oh, yeah.
Hey, don't that cheese burn the roof of your mouth?
Hmm?
Um...
Uh, you... you know Reverend Biggs?
- Sure, from St. Matt's.
- Yeah, that's the one.
Stubborn, isn't he? Kinda short with people too. Didn't you notice?
This man right here?
Not that I know him that well.
I'm just...
- He came to the hospital every day after my wife's surgery.
- Every day?
He baptized all five of my kids.
- All five of them?
- Yeah. Give me this.
- Wait. I didn't mean anything.
- Go on, get on out of here!
You better go. Get on outta here.
And don't come back.
I'm telling you, Mama, he was there.
Like he fell from the sky.
Then he did a dance and jumped around.
Mommy's gonna stop giving you sugar cereal in the morning, baby.
- Come on. Who's that?
- Ho, ho, ho.
- Santa Claus!
- Merry Christmas!
Ho, ho, ho, ho.
Merry Christmas, Santa.
- Thank you, little bro.
- Here, put some money in.
Mmm. Mmm. Mmm.
- Mmm-mmm-mmm.
- Thank you, sir.
- Merry Christmas.
- Same to you, buddy.
- Osbert! Merry Christmas!
- How've you been, sister?
- Shh. Mm-mm.
- Come on, Jeremiah.
- Ho, ho, ho!
- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you, brother.
God bless Mommy and Daddy and Grandma and Hakim.
- Amen.
- Amen.
Okay, fella, let's get into bed.
Legs under.
Thank you.
All right.
I'm going to be sad when he goes.
We all will.
We'll all miss Hakim.
Will I have to go live with another family too?
Of course not, Jeremiah.
Of course not.
Get some sleep.
I will if you sing to me.
All right.

Let's go! Get in! Go, go, go!

Help me, help me, look!
- Hey, hey, calm down.
- They robbed me! They broke my window!
- That's him over there!
- That's him? Freeze!
- That's him over there.
- Don't shoot.
- Turn around!
- That ain't mine, man. He dropped it.
- Get against the wall.
- I was returning a tape, man.
I live right down the street.
That was you.
I saw you break my window!
- I was at the ATM.
- You have the right to remain silent.
I have the receipt in my pocket!
Billy looked so sad. Why did they have him in handcuffs? He's not a criminal.
Do you think they'll give him dinner?
He hasn't had anything since lunch.
- I know he's hungry.
- He'll just be there overnight.
His bail hearing will be set for sometime tomorrow.
Has he ever been in trouble before?
- Two years ago.
- Oh, great!
I was able to get the judge to give him probation, as long as I found him a job.
- And you did.
- I promised I would straighten him out.
Looks like I didn't do such a good job.
Oh, no.
He's a different kid now.
Watches the little ones while I'm at work.
I don't know what I'm going to do if they take him away from me.
- Don't worry. We'll talk tomorrow.
- Thank you.
- Bye.
- Saul, Saul, Saul! Over here!
Look, kids!
We don't have to walk.
Come on, kids.
Come on, kids.
- Henry.
- Let's go. Watch your brother.
No fingerprints on the windshield, if you please.
Try to keep the feet off the seats, too, huh?
All right.
Get on, sweetheart.
- Feet on the floor, please.
- They are!
- Me too.
- King Saul's Charter Service.
- We make jail calls.
I appreciate it, Saul.
We all do.
You're a minister, you know.
You're not a social worker.
I'll file a complaint.
See you.
All right, y'all.
Everybody sit down, now.
Sit down, put your seat belts on.
Nobody gets carsick, do they?
- I do!
- Just stick your head out that window!
- Go on. It's not that cold out!
- Saul!
What did they give you?
They give you eggs? Oh, no!
Okay.
Come on.
Great.
Lord, if You are really up there...
I need some help.
- Henry?
- You again.
- Yep.
- What do you want from me now?
Uh, wait. I'm supposed to ask you that question.
Right now, all I want is to put my key in the ignition... turn it and have it...
- What else?
Oh, I suppose you think that you...
Who are you?
Really?
All right, but it might be best if you don't tell anybody else.
No. No.
My name's Dudley, as you remember... when I saw you at the Youth Center, and...
I'm an angel.
I beg your pardon?
An angel.
You know, like in the Bible?
Of course you are!
The angel Dudley?
- % Ding%
- That must have been that part of the Bible that got lost.
I knew you wouldn't understand.
I know you don't believe me.
It's hard, even for you.
But angels cannot lie, Henry. We're not allowed to. It's in the angel handbook.
- Of course it is. No, that's okay.
- I'll show it to you.
- No, I'm gonna show you.
I'm gonna show you.
- That's okay. Okay, fine.
Thanks for everything. Say hello to the Big Guy and the Easter Bunny too.
- Wait, wait, wait. Can I exp...
- It's freezing.
- Let's get a cab.
- Can't afford one.
Can I get in?
Yes, it's cold out and...
Get in.
- You've got a good heart, Henry.
- Come on.
- You've got a good heart.
- Yeah, a good heart.
- Are you ready?
- Yes.
Don't draw on the window.
Oh, God.
I miss this place, Henry.
I had some wonderful times down here, I tell you.
Oh, I'm not supposed to go into how l...
Ohh. The seat belt, please.
But, as you can see,
I was cut down in my prime.
Yeah. Mm-hmm.
Ever since then, Henry,
I've been up there... waitin' in line for a chance to get sent back down here.
- It's a long line, too, let me tell you.
- You don't say.
Oh, I do say.
You've got no idea what the competition is like just to get sent down here.
Everybody wants this job.
I don't know why
He sent me, Henry, but I'm glad He did.
- Yeah.
- And I'm going to do everything I can to help you.
- Thank you very much.
- Oh, I need to go over the rules, if that's okay with you?
- Oh, no, no, no. That's not necessary.
- It'll only take a second, Henry.
- Oh, all right.
- "Rule Number One: We can't do anything you should be doing."
That makes sense. If I'm doing it, that'd be two of us, wouldn't it?
Exactly. "Number Two: Everything you do must be done of your own free will."
- Now, that's a biggie.
- Tough, but fair. Are there many more?
Finally, when I leave, when the mission is accomplished, you won't have any memory of me.
That's my favorite.
Okay, so I got my rules.
Where can I drop you?
- Uh, how about right here?
- Good.
- See you later, Henry.
- Um...
Uh, ooh, ooh...
Hold... Wait a minute.
Look. If you...
If you really want to talk to me, my office is always open.
- Just make an appointment.
- Thank you.
Okay.
Feel it?
Kinda like springtime and Mom's home cooking all rolled into one?
I don't feel a thing.
You will.
Have faith.
Good night, Henry.
Good night.

Julia, we've always done it like this.
Why, all of a sudden, are you changing?
Well, Mrs. Havergal, we're gonna do it a little different tonight.
- Is that all right with you?
Let's try it.
One, two, three.

- Thank you.
- Hmm.

- % Whole armor of God%
Mmm, now some of these ornaments are old as Methuselah.
Oh, honey, your years on the top of the Christmas tree are over.
Have you been smoking?
No, no, I have not.
Good TV tonight?
What do you see when you look at a place like this?
I'll tell you what I see.
Sterling Acres.
- The latest development miracle from Hamilton Realty.
- Well, not anymore.
I see 200 luxury apartments.
Over here, a 24-hour health club, right on the grounds.
State-of-the-art security, designer interiors you have to see to believe.
The kind of homes that you deserve!
And I know, because I'm Joe Hamilton... and I care about the things you care about.
He's so oily, you can fry chicken on that man's smile.
Hmm.
- He called here tonight.
- Huh?
Said there's a meeting at his office tomorrow at 11:00.
He's got something he wants to show you.
Now, Henry,
I know it's none of my business...
I'm glad you realize that,
Marguerite.
I'll be in my office.

- It's the boiler!
- Don't forget your coats.
Need to be now.
This is all I need.
Come on. Careful.
Be careful.
Julia, get everyone out of the building.
Come on, hurry, hurry.
Henry! The boiler!
- Yeah, I know it.
- Button up, button up.
What do you need?
Do you need anything?
Careful, Mrs. Havergal.
- You've got the devil in that basement there.
I know, I know.
Don't slip. I got it.
Careful, children, careful.
Oh, no, no!
Look at this.
Aww. Oh, no.
You could have given us one more winter.
- Is it open?
- Yes, Jeremiah. I left it open.
- Okay? All right. Sleep well.
- Okay.
Good night, Mommy.
What a night.
I don't even want to think about tomorrow... between the boiler and Hakim leaving.
Now, why... why are they gonna send that boy... to a foster home so far away?
I knew I should have called...
Honey, you called half the agencies in the state.
I know, I know.
But maybe the answer was in the other half.
I'm losing them, Julia.
One by one.
Hakim, Saul, Billy... the youth center.
I know it's my fault, but I just can't seem...
- You know, honey,
I had some thoughts on...
- Can we do this in the morning?
'Cause I'm beat.
Yeah, the morning's fine.
Good night, Julia.
Yoo-hoo! Mornin'!
Whoo!
I brought the mail in.
Anybody wanna open it?
Oh. Well, I'll just take my coat off... and bring it on into the office, then.
Look, I know things have been tough around here lately, and that's my fault.
But everything is gonna be all right.
- I'm comin'! Ooh! I got it!
Hello? Who?
- Mm-hmm.
- If only saying it made it all right.
- Yeah.
- You see? If you'd listened, you'd have heard an apology.
Not a big one, but a start.
- Uh-huh.
- No, what I heard is a man saying...
"How can I deal with this fast enough, then get on with the rest of my day?"
- You see, that's not fair.
- Oh, it's not fair?
Girl, I'm trying to listen!
Yeah, I'll give him the message. Uh-huh.
We've got to stop talking around Mama.
She knows too much of our business.
That was Anna Eldridge. Billy's bail hearing's been scheduled for 9:30.
9:30! We'll finish this later, honey.
I promise.
- Are you coming home after?
- Not right after.
- I have to be somewhere at 11:00.
- Joe Hamilton.
- Do you mind?
- Oh, Henry.
Do I look like I mind?
You ready to talk about this, little girl?
I don't know what you mean, Mama.
I think things are looking up for us.
Mmm-hmm.
There goes that behind again.
% I know He's keeping me alive%
% Keeping me alive%
% Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum%
% He's all over me%
% And He's keepin' me alive%
% Oooh, yeah
He's all over me%
% Ooh-ooh, keepin' me alive%
% And He's all over me%
% Ooh-ooh, keepin'... % %
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to frighten you.
I didn't hear you come in!
You waitin' for the pastor?
Yes, yes.
My name's Dudley.
- Beverly.
- How are you?
- I'm the pastor's secretary.
- Pleasure to meet you.
You just missed him.
He went to court.
- These your children?
- Yeah, that's them.
Oh, they're beautiful.
Where was your husband?
Taking the picture?
Mm-hmm.
Then he took the car and the waitress at the diner and moved to Cleveland.
- Sorry to hear that.
- You have any children?
No, no. Never had a chance to settle down. I wanted to.
- You smell wonderful.
What do you call that?
Soap.
I haven't smelled a woman in such a long time.
I'll get you a bar for Christmas.
Do you have an appointment?
Uh, no, not exactly.
I was... sent to help the reverend, like an assistant.
Assistant? I haven't heard anything about no...
Oh, my Lord!
Am I gettin' fired?
No, no, no.
It's just temporary.
Temporary! I ain't heard nothing about no temporary!
- Well, there's nothing... Uh, look.
- Oh, God.
- Let me get you some coffee.
- Coffee!
You made coffee on that machine?
I've been trying for six weeks to figure out that machine!
My babies need new glasses, and I'm out of a job!
Look, mister, I have kids.
They're growin' like weeds.
And if you think I get a penny from that man, you got another thought comin'!
I can't take this!
Bein' fired!
Take it easy.
There's nothing to worry about. Here.
Oooh! Oooh!
Look at you.
You're crying.
Here, blow, blow.
Oh. I knew that.
Your Honor, my client,
Billy Eldridge... was sent by his mother to return a video rental...
It's all here, Miss Chattan.
Well, the Reverend Biggs is present in the courtroom... and he is willing to post bail.
This is a serious felony.
Bail is set at $ 25,000.
- Your Honor, I have evidence...
- May I address the court?
I'm turning it over for grand jury action. Next case.
We love you, Billy.
He didn't do it.
Clear the court.
What am I gonna do?
- Would you clear the court?
- I'll take care of it.
Next case.
I said, next case!
Pending 802, Harley Williamson.
- You could hide.
- Mm-mm.
- Take this. I'll bring him right out.
- Sure. No problem.
Here.
They might starve you.
Thanks.
Okay, they've got everything.
All ready to go.
Hey, guys!
Hakim, you remember
Robbie, don't you?
Hakim gets to ride in the train today.
Wow. A train ride.
We're running a little late.
Okay.
Take care of yourself, okay?
See you soon. Say good-bye, Jer.
Bye.
Take care.
Bye, Hakim.
We'll miss you.
Hold on, baby.
It's cold out here.
Who will I tell my secrets to?
Well, you can phone Hakim sometimes, okay?
And Mommy'll teach you how to write, so you can send him letters.
Bye.
I know You have a master plan, but... sometimes You're just a little tough to figure.
Jeremiah.
- Jeremiah.
- It's not fair!
Hakim left.
Julia.
This is Dudley, the reverend's new assistant.
Assistant? He wrote to the church council months ago for extra help.
Well, the extra help is here.
Oooooh.
But he didn't say anything about getting a response. Who sent you, exactly?
Uh, the, uh...
The Top Man himself,
Mrs. Biggs.
- Julia.
- Julia.
And this is Julia's mother,
Mrs. Coleman.
Of course it is.
Well, it's obvious where
Julia's beauty comes from.
Oh. And me with my hair lookin' like this.
- Oh, no. It looks magnificent.
- Why, thank you.
- Well, Mr., um...
- You can call me Dudley.
- Dudley. You're very welcome here.
- Thank you.
Excuse us.
What are you doing?
Now, that's what I call good-lookin'!
Your daddy used to look like that back in 19...
Ma, ma, ma.
I've heard it 100 times.
Yeah, well, maybe now, with him around, you'll have time to deal with some of your own problems.
The Good Lord's the only one who can do that.
- Honey, you don't mean that.
- Yeah, I do.
Ma!
I was gonna go over by the window, Julia.
There's too many rules in this house.
You're the man in the street... and in the snow and...
My name's Dudley.
I'm here to help your father.
- I'm Jeremiah.
- It's nice to meet you, Jeremiah.
You've got a real nice room here.
Thank you.
Wow, you've got a lot of neat stuff in here.
And what is this?
My toy ambulance is broken.
The battery got stole, and the lights don't work anymore.
Is that right?
I'll see what I can do here.
It never had a siren!
Never had a siren?
No.
You look sad there, Jeremiah.
Have you been crying?
Yes.
I'm sorry about your friend, Hakim.
What if I told you... that he's not really gone?
Hakim?
Did he run away and come back?
- No, he never left.
- Yes, he did. I saw him go.
Well, you know, my mother... once lost someone who was very dear to her.
He wasn't as young as Hakim, but he was... too young, just the same.
And she would always do something that seemed to make her feel better.
- You want to try it?
- Yeah.
All right, close your eyes.
Do you remember playing in the snow with Hakim?
Do you remember what his laugh sounded like?
Yes.
Do you remember what he looked like catching a ball?
He never caught the ball in his life.
But I remember.
That's because when God takes someone away from us...
He leaves what's most important about that person with us.
Right here in our hearts.
Yeah, but I still miss him.
Well, she still misses him too.
Are you all right?
Maybe you should close your eyes.
Mommy says I can write to him.
- Do you know how to spell his name?
- No.
- You want to learn? All right.
- Yeah!
- Hakim starts with an "H."
- And ends with "akim."
- There you go. Perfect.
Wow!
Fishies in a TV.
Windows.
Henry?
I know I said make an appointment... but I didn't say anything about filling out any form.
Beverly!
Beverly, I need you.
I gave her the day off to do some Christmas shopping, Henry.
You gave my secretary the day...
Yes, she needed some time off to be with her children... and I needed time to do my job with you.
- What job? What are you doing here?
- Henry, Henry, Henry!
How many times I got to tell you?
I'm here in answer to your request for help. And Julia's.
You can forget about the boiler.
You got more important problem...
Ah, here she is now.
- Henry?
- Wha...
Whoo! Lord have mercy!
Honey, remind me the next time I pay a visit, I wanna get paid! Okay?
- Hi, Dudley.
- Julia.
- Dudley. D-U-D-L-E-Y.
- Perfect.
- Very good.
- Poi-fect. Poi-fect.
- What happened with Billy Eldridge?
Uh, uh, the judge set the bail at $25,000.
- Henry, that child's still in jail?
- Julia, I did what I could!
Come on, sweetie.
We have a nativity play to rehearse.
You can't rehearse.
It's freezing in there.
Henry, I'll be chasing 15 kids all day.
I don't think I'll get cold.
And after we're through, you're taking your son shopping, remember?
- Henry.
- Huh?
Your wife's talking to you.
Oh, yes, uh, uh...
Hanley's, 1:00. 1:00?
Spell Hakim for me, baby.
M-l-K-A-H.
Dudley's teaching me to spell backwards.
Maybe he can teach Daddy how to be on time.
These are perfect. Beverly never typed a perfect letter in her life.
Yes, I did those myself, once I figured out that fish typewriter.
Let's get this straight, Dud.
I do not appreciate some stranger coming into my office...
Angels are hardly strangers, Henry.
And don't call me "Dud."
Julia, hold on! Wait for me!
Excuse me, Mother, not now. I'm having a little meeting. You understand.
- Bye, Marguerite!
- Bye, Dudley!
- Mama, come on!
- Start that rehearsal!
You are not going around telling my family this ridiculous story...
No, of course not.
They think the church council sent me.
The church council!
Why don't we continue this on our way to the meeting with Joe Hamilton?
The meeting.
- So, which floor is he on?
- I'm not telling.
- Henry, what's the floor?
- Go away.
- You asked for help.
- Not from you. I don't need you in here, out there or anywhere.
You didn't have to let the doors close on me downstairs, Henry. That was cold.
Well, I figured you'd just fly up.
You know, if you're really a you-know-what, where are your wings?
You're caught up in stereotypes, Henry.
That's your problem.
Hello, Reverend.
That's a beautiful dress you have on.
Just magnificent.
Why, thank you.
- You're very welcome.
Is Mr. Hamilton inside?
Oh, he's taping another TV commercial, but you can wait in his office.
- Thank you.
- You're very welcome.
Hamilton Realty.
Hi, Amy.
You know that old dress from Mom's closet? It's back in style.
"That's a lovely dress!"
It was a lovely dress. I mean, you gotta admit, it was a lovely dress.
What kind of angel talks like that?
The kind of angel that has good taste.
Well, you're still not going in here.
Henry, I'm like this with the creator of the entire universe.
- Now, you don't think a little door's gonna stop me, do you?
- Yes.
How? How?
Rule Number Two.
All right, fine, Henry. Can't make you do anything you don't wanna do.
That's right! That's right!
I always liked that rule!
Did you like that smile?
I tilted my head to the side.
I loved it.
- Henry Biggs.
- Joe Hamilton.
- How are you doing? Julia's good?
- She's very good.
- Uh, Henry, this is Debbie Page.
- Hi.
- She's the station manager over at WRKO.
They're televising your Christmas sermon this year.
We need to get your text for the TelePrompTer, Reverend.
- I'm working on it.
- Later, Debbie. Come on.
Let's see the guys.
- Wait 'til you see where you're gonna move to, Henry.
- What?
A planned community.
Your son could ride his bike to school.
- Mary?
- Henry!
Osbert?
What are you doing here?
Well, I, we, um... We came to check out, the same as you, Henry!
Saul.
Uh, listen to the man, Henry.
We think it makes sense.
Well, of course it makes sense.
That's what it's gonna look like when it's finished.
- What do you think, Henry?
- Isn't that nice?
It's a new city landmark.
It's a whole new neighborhood.
A different clientele, so to speak.
I'm hoping, with everyone here, we can once and for all... persuade you to move into the new world, Henry.
Well, all we need is a boiler that works... and we'll be fine in the world that we're in.
New boiler. Henry, look at this.
Day care facilities.
We need that.
We could sure use that.
Senior citizens' club.
- That's much better than ours.
- Mm-hmm.
- What I'm offering you here, Henry...
- Well, it is.
TV cameras and lighting built right in.
- Look at that!
- It's a pulpit to preach to the world!
It's beautiful!
All you have to say is,
"I'll do it."
Say yeah. Say yeah.
All right.
Look, say yes, and I'll throw in that new boiler.
I'll stop St. Matt's from freezing over Christmas... if that's the price
I have to pay to get you.
And if I accept, what price am I paying?
Henry, what you see there is the answer to all your problems.
Amen.
Isn't it?
- I need my Magi. The Magi's entrance.
- What does the sheep say in this play?
- Baaaa!
Ah. Mmm.
Does everybody know their parts?
You know your parts?
- What's my part?
- What's your part? You're a camel.
- I need my shepherds.
- I'm a shepherd.
- Come here. You two, over here.
- I'm the angel.
- In there. Come on.
Kick it, Mrs. Havergal.
Let's do this.
Jeremiah, get in your place, please.

You take this one solo, okay?
- Okay?
- Comet's swingin'!
- Ooh, look at that.
- Beautiful, isn't it?
Uh-huh.
Sure is.
Go in and try it on.
We're supposed to be shopping for Henry, remember?
You with that nightgown on is all the gift Henry would want.
- Trust me.
- A gift from Jeremiah.
- Oh. Ho, ho.
- Mmm.
So how long do you think he's gonna be with that snake?
He'll be along soon.
How'd you two meet, anyway?
Hmm. We were in adjoining strollers, and, uh... and one day I took his pacifier, and he made a really big noise about it.
Who wouldn't?
You know, when he was about ten, he started wearing suits to school.
- What?
- Trying to impress me.
Obviously, it worked.
He'd walk me home... and I always thought he was cuter without his glasses, so... one day he took them off for me.
And he slipped on the ice, and fell right on his fanny.
Sounds like love to me.
Daddy said we were born friends.
He did a lot for Henry, your father.
He was the best.
Mommy.
Enough!
- Is it good, Dudley?
- Mm-hmm. Great.
How is your food, Jeremiah?
Mmmmm.
- Julia.
- Henry.
Ah, Jeremiah.
Dudley!
- Henry.
- Okay, Jer. Let's go shopping.
- Wait, honey. What happened?
- I'll tell you later.
- Come on. Come on.
- Henry, it is later.
It's about an hour later than when you were supposed to be here.
- Now, what happened?
- It's a long story.
You know, you and Julia need to talk.
I can take Jeremiah shopping.
I'm an excellent gift consultant.
Yes, Dudley.
I want Dudley.
Wait a minute.
I wanted to take him shopping.
You two have more important things to talk about.
- Dud-ley! Dud-ley! Dud-ley!
- Jeremiah.
We'll be right across the street at the toy store. Okay?
- Julia! Julia!
- Dud-ley!
- Jere-miah! Put your hat on.
- Dud-ley! Dud-ley!
- So, who are we shopping for?
- Grandma.
- Any idea what she wants?
- A new ashtray.
- Mom took all her old ones.
- Let's get something for Hakim.
So, what happened?
Julia.
L...
I've decided to accept
Joe Hamilton's offer.
Julia, did you hear me?
- I heard you. I just can't believe what I've heard.
- Then let me explain.
Excuse me.
Can I get you anything?
Oh, no, no, no.
No, thank you.
Okay.
Listen, Saul was there,
Mary Halford, Andy and Osbert.
But what were they doing there?
Every one of them was begging me, arguing with me, blackmailing me.
- Blackmail!
- They're gonna put in a new boiler tomorrow.
- Henry, he bought you for a boiler?
- Shh. Julia.
Sorry. Sorry. Excuse us.
Of course not!
- Oooooh...
- Julia, let me show you something.
Julia, Julia... he is building the most beautiful church you've ever seen.
Look at that.
Day care center, youth center.
Henry, he is building a shrine to himself!
Eight years, Julia.
And what do I have to show for it?
So you give up our lives without even talking to me, Henry?
This solves all of our problems, Julia.
Why can't you see that?
My father trusted you with St. Matt's.
How dare you walk out on it like this!
All right, all right.
Your father was a saint, and I'm not!
But I'm here, Julia, and he isn't.
I'm sorry, Julia.
Give me the car keys, Henry!
Julia!
- Julia, please sit down.
- Give me the keys, Henry.
Would you kindly give her the keys?
I have customers sitting here.
Sorry. Sorry.
Julia, please listen to me.
Henry, I can't.
I don't even know who you are anymore.
Julia.
Come on, Jeremiah.
We're leaving.
I got Daddy's present.
And I bought a fire engine for Hakim.
It was on sale.
Yes, that's wonderful, honey.
That's wonderful.
All right. You're going to have to support him now, Julia.
You hear me?
Now is when he needs you most.
Mama, I can't support what's wrong.
Preachin' God's word is never wrong, no matter where you do it from.
He didn't even discuss it with me.
Daddy would have never made a decision like that without discussing it with you.
Sure he would. Your Daddy kept things from me all the time.
Especially church business.
Well, it was different in those days.
Those days!
Child, men ain't changed since Adam!
And he gave up one of his own ribs, just so he could have somebody to keep things from!
You know, gettin'angry at a dead tree is not gonna help.
Yeah, but it wouldn't look good to punch out a pastor, either.
No, you don't... you don't... you don't mean that...
'Cause you know you love him.
Yeah, he knows it, too.
That's the problem.
He knows I'll always be there, just like a pet.
- Ouch!
- See? God doesn't like ugly.
- Let me see.
You ever had your palm read?
Okay.
I see a beautiful woman with a good heart.
Only has to open her eyes to realize that everything she ever wanted... she already has.
You didn't even look at my hand.
But I held it.
Do you see Henry and me?
Hmmm... let's see.
- Ow! Ow! Ow!
- Ohhh.
Oh, it's so hot,
I had to let it go.
You must be talking about my past.
- Mrs. Biggs, you forgot this.
- Thanks.
Every fire dies sometime,
Dudley.
What do you do when you have to decide if the memory of it is enough?
- What do you do?
- Yeah.
What you do is you... you go dancing, that's what you do. You go out.
- Dancing?
- Yes.
You're gonna go dancing, put on a beautiful dress, make your husband break out the cologne.
- Have you met my husband?
- That's right, I met him.
- He hasn't taken me out in...
- Far too long. That's my point.
But tonight's gonna be different.
Tonight you're gonna strike a match.
No, not a match, a, a firecracker!
You'll see.
You take your coat off, you go upstairs and you take your wife out dancing.
Can't do it.
Not tonight.
Henry, you and Julia need this.
Mr. Kingman needs his minister with him at the hospital, and the seniors need blankets.
You're only one man, Henry.
Things don't get fixed waiting for the next guy to do it.
- Including marriages.
- Dudley!
Henry!
You already told her, didn't you?
She's upstairs dressing right now...
- and once again
I'm gonna look like the bad guy.
- Not if you go.
- Dudley!
- What? I'm just trying to help you.
You're just trying to help.
All right, you can help... by taking her.
- Me?
- Yes, you.
- You're missing the point, Henry.
- No, no.
The point is...
Mr. Kingman won't wait.
Now, you go, tell me all about it later.
- And you make sure you tell her I'm sorry.
- Ohh, Henry.
- Good night.
- Henry.
- Not too late.
- Henry.
- And no drinking.
It was not supposed to go like this.
Good night, Mommy.
Okay, good night.
Don't worry about us.
I'm gonna give 'em a hot bath... and then we're gonna play Monopoly... for real money!
Yea!
How do I look?
Oh! Oh, my!
Henry?
Henry? Henry?
- Where's Henry?
- He said... He said he's sorry.
- He's sorry?
- Yeah, he had to go.
One of the congregation is in the hospital. Mr. Kingman.
Oh, yeah.
He's been sick a long time.
I'll call his wife tomorrow.
Look, Julia, he suggested that I, uh... pinch-hit for him, if that's okay with you.
Hmm?
Welcome to Jazzie's, folks. Come on in.
- Thanks.
- Thank you.
- My brother.
Ahhh!
Nice, huh? Dancing. Do you dance?
I bet you're a good dancer.
It's been a long time.
You want to dance?
Why not?
- All right.
- Give it a shot.
- Bust a move. Right.
- Bust a move.
It doesn't seem like we're dancing right for this music, huh?
Get down.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, I see what you mean.
Yeah.
Oh, my.
Go, brother!
Ooh, hit it!
- What's he doing?
Mmm!
Ooh.
- What's that one?
- The Popeye.
- The Popeye. Okay.
- It's comin' back now.
- I guess.
Whoo! You get out about as much as I do.
Less! Even less!
Oh, there we go!
- Oh, you're swimming.
- Yeah, backstroking.
- Jules!
- Bristloe!
- How you doin', sweet thing?
- Oh, my Lord!
- I thought you were in Paris.
- I was, but I've been back a while.
You and Henry don't come by here much anymore.
Henry's been real busy.
But it's great to see you!
- You too! How you doin', sweet thing?
- Oh, I'm okay.
Dudley, Bristloe.
Bristloe, Dudley.
- Oh, hey. How ya doin'?
- A pleasure, a pleasure.
If Henry hadn't helped me with that plane ticket,
I never would've gotten to Paris.
I tell you,
I owe that man everything.
- You should call him and tell him.
- I will.
Do that.
He'd love to hear from you.
Why don't we all just sit down and visit?
Yeah.
- Okay.
- Thank you. Thank you.
So, Bristloe, are you and Maxine still together?
- Oh, you better believe it.
- Oh, good.
She still calls six times a day to make sure I'm being a good boy.
Fine woman, that Maxine.
You married, Dudley?
No, no.
No, I've never been lucky enough to meet someone like Maxine... or Julia.
Ain't that the truth?
Used to be a time this little girl could come by here every night.
- Yeah? You used to come in here?
- Sure.
Henry proposed to me right over there, in that booth.
- Get outta here! Right over there?
- That's right.
- Those were the good old days, huh?
- Sure were.
- Couldn't squeeze a dime between 'em.
- Whew.
She used to go on stage and torch the place down.
Get outta here.
Now she just sings for the Lord.
Not that that's bad.
No, no, no.
That's good.
Let me tell you somethin'.
Ever want to know what lovin' really sounds like...
- she's got that secret in her voice.
- Oh, Bristloe, please.
Why don't you share that secret with us, Julia?
- Come on, remind us.
- No. It's been years, a long time.
- You still do it in B?
- No, no, Bristloe. I don't do it at all.
Well, I'd like to know what love really sounds like.
- Well, that solves that problem.
- Bristloe.
- I don't know the song.
- Don't want to hear another word.
- I don't...
- We want to hear you sing.
You sang it for Henry.
I should be going home.
- We're going to play this in B.
Just follow me, okay?
- Okay.
- Follow him, guys.
- You go out there. Go on. Yeah.
- Go on, sing it for Henry.
No. No.
Here we go.

% Well, as far as I can see%
% You will always be%

Thank you.
Thank you very much.
You're bad.
One for you.
One for me.
And one for the tree.
- Thank you.
- I got your Christmas present yesterday.
You did?
What'd you get?
I can't tell you.
It's a secret.
What are you getting Mom for Christmas?
I don't know.
What do you think I should get her?
I think she'd like to go to bed.
Excuse me, young man?
She was looking at a nightie in the store window with Dudley.
Was she now?
All right, come on, young man.
Sleep time.
Wait for your mama to get home, you'll be too big for the bed.
Go get some more Vicks on your chest.
See if we can rid of that stuffy nose.
I think you were born with a stuffy nose. Come on, here.
- Good night, Daddy.
- Good night, son.
Oh, thank you.
- Have a good evening.
- Thank you.
- Did you have a good time?
- Are you kidding?
I had a great time. You?
I had a ball.
You're not such a bad dancer.
- I haven't had so much fun in a long time.
- I did too.
- I heard you singing.
- Yeah, I was about to get up there with you.
- I'm so glad you didn't.
- % I believe in miracles%
- Shh! They're probably all asleep.
- Not all of us.
- Henry.
- Dudley.
I guess I don't have to ask if you had a... good time.
We did. We went to Jazzie’s.
Some of the old band was there, and...
You've been at Jazzie's?
Yeah. Yeah.
Bristloe was there too.
- Henry, your wife got on stage.
- Oh, wait, wait.
You went singing at Jazzie's all night?
- You told me to take her out.
- Not to the place where I proposed!
Henry, we had fun.
Remember what that used to be?
But honey. Jazzie's?
Well, maybe I sang at Jazzie’s because
I won't be singing in any Joe Hamilton church, wherever that may be.
- Thanks, Dudley.
- Good night, Julia.
- She had a good time, Henry.
- Oh, really?
Yeah. Yeah.
She told me about how you proposed.
- She showed me the booth.
- The booth?
I don't believe this entire situation!
No, you don't.
That's your trouble right there.
You don't believe in much of anything anymore, do you, Henry?
You don't believe in me.
You don't believe in yourself.
You don't believe you can make a difference anymore.
You don't even believe that Billy Eldridge is innocent.
Billy... Of course I do.
You don't sound very convincing, Henry.
I tried to help him before.
- Did you?
- Yes.
And besides, he doesn't even go to church.
Have you tried looking him in the eye and asking him to tell the truth?
No. You know why?
I guess I was just too busy having fun.
I guess that's your problem, Henry.
You're just too busy.
Your wife feels like she's in a marriage by herself.
Your son lost his best friend.
What are you doing about that, Henry?
You don't have to listen to me.
You're right.
But you ought to listen to them.
Come on, everybody.
Time to make the Christmas baskets.
Aren't you gonna help?
I miss Hakim.
I know.
But a lot of people are depending on us for those baskets.
- What do you think?
- Okay, then.
All right?
Gym socks. Now, nothing says
"Merry Christmas" like gym socks.
Ahh.
Uh, Billy.
Uh... here.
Thank you.
Billy, I need to talk to you.
You're wasting your time, you know that?
The grand jury's about to indict me in there.
You ever pray, son?
Oh, yeah. Yeah, right.
You're too hip for that.
All right. Okay.
- You play ball?
- Yeah.
When you play basketball, don't you hope that when you shoot the ball... that the ball goes into the net?
Yeah.
Well, that's all prayer is: Hope.
And helping to give people hope is what I do.
What's the point?
No one believes me anyway.
Billy...
Look at me, son.
Were you a part of this or not?
I swear, Rev, it happened just like I said.
I've messed up before, but I'm telling you the truth.
When was the last time you said a prayer, Billy?
I don't know.
Well, I think it's about time you gave it a try.
- What's the status of this case?
- Good morning, Judge!
Beautiful day, isn't it?
Reverend Biggs, this is not a playground!
It's a court of law!
I don't have time...
I work for an even higher court,
Your Honor, and I'm finding the time.
- I came to tell you
Billy Eldridge is innocent.
- I have your word on that?
- What does it take for me to show you?
- Let him in.
On his way to return a video, he got $20 from an auto-teller.
There's a time on the receipt.
- The victim identified him, Reverend.
The victim...
Saw him standing there, Your Honor, and that's all Billy was doing.
There's a grand jury hearing going on right down the hall... but the D.A. Won't even present it if you don't buy the evidence.
- And you know there isn't any.
- Reverend, come here. Come here.
I appreciate you wanting to help the boy.
The young man, Your Honor, helped himself.
He shows up every day to his $4.25 an hour job at Sampson's Stationery... a job he's held steady for two years... and he goes to school at night.
He came to a crossroads a long time ago, Your Honor.
And he chose the right path.
Now it's up to you... to judge not his past, but his future; not his failures, but his dreams; not his imperfections, but his possibilities.
Hallelujah!
% Hallelujah, hallelujah%
% Hallelujah%
- Is that Billy?
- % Hallelujah, hallelujah%
- It is!
- % Hallelujah% %
Mama, Mama, Billy's home!
- They're all waiting for you.
- Thanks a lot, Rev.
- You're welcome, son.
- I prayed for you, Billy.
Hey, Jessica!
I missed you.
Come here, kids.
How y'all doin'?
- Good to see you, son.
- Where the boys at?
Hey, bro, what's up?
God bless you, Pastor.
You guys get in the house.
- Billy's home! Billy's home!
- Come on, Mom.
- It's so good to see you.
Did they hurt you?
- No, they didn't hurt me.
Are you all right?
Are you hungry?
You're hungry. You're hungry.
Kids, get the good dishes out.
Two points.
He's doin' it better than you.
I don't know, Dudley. I'm a mother.
I can't die like this.
Time out. My feet sore.
I want to watch.
Okay, baby, you can watch.
- Whoa!
- That was fun.
- Whoa!
- Okay.
All right, you sit here.
- Okay.
- And Mommy'll be right over there skating, okay?
Keep warm, and the cocoa man is going to bring you something to drink, okay?
- Look out for Daddy.
- Hi, Lisa. Over here!
Come on, Julia.
- Mademoiselle.
- "Madame," please.
- And nothing too fancy, you.
- Oui, Oui.
% Who would've thought%
- % That I might feel like this%
- All right.
- % Some kind of wonderful%
- You wait. I'll get better.
% There's nothing quite comparable%
% The thing about it is%
- Bend your knees. You're a natural.
I told you I'd get better.
I wonder where Henry is.
This time of day?
Probably stuck in traffic.
- % I'm about to lose a fight%
- Oh, come on!
Where did this light come from?
- Damn! I don't believe this.
- % Spend every day with you%
% And I swear it brings me closer%
- % To my only reservation%
% Is you, my sweet temptation baby%
- Mommy!
- Jeremiah!

- Oh, I can't take this. What gives?

% You're breaking all my rules%
- % But is it in your smile%

Hi, Ma.
Shhh.
The movie's almost over.
I can help you with that.
- Oh, thank you.
- Madame.
All right, off with the boots.
Grandma's crying.
Yeah, baby, she cries at these movies every Christmas.
She cries at "Jingle Bells."
Ohh! So skatin' was good, huh?
- Uh, yeah.
- Yeah, it was okay.
- It was nice. I had a good...
- It was a nice time.
- It was great. It was nice, skating.
- Grandma.
Yeah, we had a good time.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, it was great.
- I laughed a lot.
- Oh, my Lord!

- Oh, my Lord.
- Ma, you said that already.
And I'm gonna say it again.
Oh, my Lord.
Ma, he's been very kind.
That's all.
At least he's got time for me.
Julia,
Henry can't be ten places at once.
And don't tell me that your daddy could.
Now pull yourself together, young lady.
You're a married woman.
Oh, Ma, I can look in the window.
Even if I don't buy.
Well, you just better not go window shopping with money in your pocket.
And you better not be puttin' anything in the layaway plan, either.
- You hear me?
- Oh, Ma.
% Two turtledoves%
- % And a partridge in a pear tree% %
- Let's do it again.
- Oh, no more, Jer, please.
- Oooh!
- Your dad's home.
Daddy, where were you?
I'm sorry, Jer.
I really am.
I just can't understand why the traffic was so bad. We'll go tomorrow, okay?
Okay. I did skating, Dad.
You did? Good for you.
And I got Billy Eldridge home for Christmas.
They dropped the charges, Henry.
How'd you do it?
I just remembered you gotta look someone in the eye to see if they're innocent.
So it wasn't that hard.
- Daddy?
- Yes, son?
- Skating isn't hard, neither.
- It isn't?
Your mom taught you, huh?
Dudley and Mom.
It was fun!
Dudley went skating with you?
We waited for you, Henry.
You didn't miss much at all.
Ah, Henry! Just the man I wanted to see. I've been working on this...
Keep away from my wife.
What'd I do now?
- You take her to lunch.
- Well, you were late, Henry.
- You take her to Jazzie’s.
- You asked me to.
You take her skating.
What kind of man do you think I am?
Keep the hell away from her.
Henry, you're a man of God.
That doesn't mean I'm blind.
Now, I've seen the way she looks at you.
Really? I mean, really.
All right, fine.
I want you to leave now.
- Now?
- Yes, now.
I don't think I can do that.
Check the angel handbook.
It says I can't leave until I'm through, I think.
You see, it says right here...
Wait a minute.
Hey! Henry!
What was that?
- Oooh!
- My goodness!
- What?
- You're in trouble.
What was that?
What is that?
It wasn't a sign that there's a new pope.
- What do you mean?
- You're in trouble.
You want me out of the house.
- Yes, I want you out.
- I'm not the problem. It wasn't me.
- It wasn't me!
- Who are you talking to?
Get out of my house!
What is going on in here?
- I am terminating Dudley's services.
- Is that what you want, Julia?
It isn't a question of what she wants.
All right, Julia, you're a part of this.
You say.
You two stop this right now.
Just stop it!
You hear me?
- You see what you did?
- It's not about me.
You and Julia would have these problems even if I never showed up.
You've forgotten what's important, for you and for her.
And you're going to remind me, I'm sure.
St. Matt's is more than just a church, Henry.
It's the glue that holds everything together in this neighborhood.
And you mark my word, without it, this neighborhood will fall, I guarantee it.
And Julia will never look at you the same.
Hey, handsome.
Come and walk me across the street.
I gotta take this plate over to Bessie Adams.
- Well, actually, I was...
- Walk me!
Delighted.
- I heard what you two were talking about.
- Really?
Now, you know I don't usually pry into other folks' business.
- Uh-huh.
- Hold on a second.
Mmm-mm!
Now, what are you doing to my daughter?
Mrs. Coleman, it's all right,
I promise you.
Nothin' is all right, Dudley, when I see a married woman look at a man that way.
I'm just tryin' to help them, that's all.
You really shouldn't smoke.
Our time here on Earth is precious.
That's right.
And you know the most precious time of all is time spent with your family.
Now, you know I'm supposed to only be here through Christmas.
But I will conveniently have a hip injury... and stay to the year 2000 if I have to.
Do you understand what I'm sayin' to you?
- I do now.
- Mm-hmm.
Look, I'm havin' a little trouble tryin' to get through to Henry.
Now, Julia, on the other hand, she's wonderful. She deserves...
What are you talkin' about what Julia deserves and what she don't?
She's Henry's wife.
Don't worry. L...
I'm sure she'll forget me as soon as I leave.
She'll forget herself if you go on like this.
Marguerite, is that you?
I'm comin', Bessie!
Now, Dudley, you are a charming person.
You go charm somebody else.
Okay?
Bessie, I'm comin' in.
Did I tell you I quit smokin'?
I'm so proud of you, sugar.
Watch it. Don't slip now.
Come on, babies, let's go. Thank you so much. Now you have a lot more room.
- Bye.
- Hi, Dudley!
- I'm just baby-sitting Jeremiah.
- Mommy, Mommy! Here, puppy.
- Get away from that dog!
- Go ahead!
- Jeremiah! Jeremiah!
Saul!
Where's he goin'now?
Thank you so much for the ride.
I know you had to go out of your way.
The first five minutes of The Nutcracker hasn't changed any since last year.
- I'll make 'em leave before the bows so we can come and get you.
- Oh, thank you.
- Um...
- Um...
- Thanks.
Okay.
- Bye-bye.
- Bye!
No time for that, Saul.
Come on, we're gonna be late.
Oh, Santa, just leave that man under my tree... if he'll fit.

Oh, Keeleys...
Take a left at Woodlawn.
The Keeleys live on Sixth.
Henry, the Keeleys live on Woodlawn.
- You're jealous.
- I am not jealous.
- Yes, you are.
- I may be a lot of things, but jealous is not one of them.
Sure, you are. You're so jealous, you can't even think straight.
I am thinking just fine, thank you.
- You can't even remember where the Keeleys live.
- The Keeleys' house is on Sixth.
- Then what's it doing over there?
- What?
Hmm.
Keeleys moved.
Woodlawn. Sixth.
- Is this it?
- Mm-hmm. There's the house.
- Be careful, Henry.
- I will be.
Drive all this way, they're probably not even home.
At least they could shovel their walkway.
- Whoooaaah!
Henry!
What are you laughin' at?
You look like a kid.
Are you all right?
- I'm fine.
- Let me help you up.
Thanks, babe.
- Oh, baby. What are you doing?
- I thought you was helpin'me up.
- You did this on purpose.
Eddie, come here quick.
It's the preacher.
- What's goin' on?
- I hope you didn't hurt yourself.
- You all right?
- We're fine.
I told these kids to shovel that walk.
They ain't got nothin' on their mind but Santa Claus. Sorry.
- This is yours. Merry Christmas.
- Us?
- Merry Christmas.
- God bless you.
- You'll catch cold. Be careful.
- We will.
I'll see you on Sunday.
We'll be there. All of us.
Seems like we've been doin' this forever.
Forever is right.
Do you remember the first time?
- My mother was visiting, yeah.
- Yes.
- You know, Henry, she never liked me.
- No, no, that's not true.
She used to say, "Girl, you better get some meat on them there bones."
Well, she just wanted you to eat, that's all.
- No, she wanted me to be as fat as her.
- She wasn't that fat.
Henry, a policeman walk down the street, see your mama and go, "Break it up!"
- Stop!
Stop it!
Rest her soul.
It's good to see you laugh again.
It's nice to have a reason to.
You know, I miss this Henry.
I wish he'd show up more often.
There.
We did it.
I'm gonna go to the church for a minute.
You go on inside.
- There we go.
- Thank you.
- Don't slip.
- I won't. Don't be long.

- We could sell ads.
- I think it could work.
- Sounds okay to me.
- Mr. Hamilton?
- Is that gonna slow us down?
- Excuse me, Mr. Hamilton.
- Yes, Bernita?
- Reverend Biggs is here to see you.
- Henry!
- Joe.
Uh... Joe...
I need to speak with you.
Can we...
Go ahead. I have no secrets from my own people here. In fact, sit down...
I've reconsidered.
I don't want the job.
- Let's go, guys.
- I can't leave my own people, Joe.
And they can't afford to travel clear up here.
- And as far as moving, Julia and l...
- Henry, a deal is a deal.
My decision is final.
I'm sorry.
You're sorry.
Sorry is not good enough, Henry!
You don't get it, Henry.
I don't care about St. Matt's.
St. Matt's is where we've been, not where we're going!
Only if people like you abandon it, Joe.
You know, it used to be you couldn't just pick up... and move away from your own people as soon as you made a couple of bucks.
There was nowhere else for us to go.
But at least our kids got to grow up with their heroes.
Henry, I'm trying to be nice to you because you and I go back a ways... and the old reverend was always real good to me.
But this is gonna happen whether you want it to or not.
With all due respect, Joe, how do you think you can make me...
Not you. The church.
It's coming down.
What's coming down?
The church is...
Henry, do you know why I am a trustee of a church I don't go to?
Because your deacons all came begging to me, telling me how broke the church was.
I bought the mortgage.
That's right!
I own it, and it's coming down.
That land's worth a lot more to me with nothing on it.
- You're gonna tear down my church?
- That's right.
- A-And build a mall and tennis courts.
- Tennis courts?
Henry, we're gonna turn that neighborhood around, attract some real money to that place.
- Oh, I see. Yeah.
- You see what I'm saying?
You think without me there to lead them, the people will just cave in.
- That's why you got me here!
- No, Henry, I want you to lead them.
- But into the future.
- Whose future, Joe?
They don't play much tennis.
Joe, come back to the church.
See exactly who you'll be hurting.
See their faces, their families, their... their children, Joe.
People are a lot tougher than you think, Henry.
Henry, look.
Come on, they'll survive.
And you still think you care about the things we care about?
"Hark! I hear Joseph and Mary in the manger."
- That's what I say.
- Only louder.
"Hark! I hear Joseph and Mary in the manger."
Then Michael and Jessica come on... and sing a really slow song.
It's not that slow, and it's very pretty.
Meanin' to ask you, you two have a fight last night?
No, Ma, we delivered
Christmas baskets.
- The gym socks were a big hit.
- Huh! I knew they would be.
- That you were right about.
- Hi there.
- Henry.
- Hello.
Dad, Jason got sick, and I'm gonna be a shepherd in the nativity play.
- I won't have to say "baaa."
- Ohh.
- That's great.
'Cause someone very special is gonna be in the audience listening to every word you say.
Huh?
- Your mother and I figured out what you'd like for Christmas.
- Yeah.
- Did you wrap it up?
- Not quite.
Hakim!
I missed you.
Ohhh.
Is he going to stay forever and ever?
Well, just 'til the new year.
Then after that, we'll see.
I have a secret to tell you.
My ambulance has a siren now.
Really?
God bless Mommy and Daddy...
And Grandma...
- And my grandma.
- Amen.
- Okay, guys, you ready?
- We did our prayers.
'Cause we were already on our knees.
Okay. It's time to get into bed now.
Come on.
Boing!
All right.
Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
No talking late now.
Close the door, please.
Okay.
- Wait 'til you meet Dudley.
- Who's that?
- The man in the gray coat.
- Huh?
- You remember.
- Oh!
Christmas is supposed to be... the most joyous day of the year.
- Henry?
- Hmm?
- Would you like some hot chocolate?
- No, thank you.
I've got to check the fuse box.
If we put any more lights on that tree, we're gonna blow up the house.
Christmas is supposed to be the most joyous day of the year.
But for St. Matt's, it's a day to surrender.
Not because I'm going to preach at another church, as some may believe... but because the people who own the building are going to tear it down.
- Now, it's no one's fault.
There is no one to blame.
- Henry.
It just seems as though despite our best efforts, our dream...
- my dream for St. Matthew's... will not come to pass.
- Ohhh.
But let's remember the good things we've shared over the years.
The laughter, the exploding boiler... the sounds of voices raised to heaven.
I'll miss it all.
I thank you for your efforts.
I thank you for your friendship.
God bless you.
I love you all.

- Thank you.
- Okay, Bernita, I'll take care of it.
I ain't buying!
For God's sake, it's Christmas Eve!
For the sake of God indeed.
Henry Biggs sent you here. I told him he's through. To hell with him.
No, to heaven with him, Joe. That's a plan not even you could mess up.
- Look, I don't know who you are, but...
- I'm an angel.
- No, not yours.
No, I'm afraid yours is a long way off.
I'm a very busy man, and you're wasting my time.
Now, I'm giving 'em another church.
St. Matt's is...
What is this?
It's like your past, Joe.
You can walk away from it, but it's still there.
What do you see when you look at a place like this?
I'll tell you what I see.
Sterling Acres.
The latest development miracle from Hamilton Realty.
I see 200 luxury apartments.
Over here, a 24-hour health club right on the grounds.
- State of the art designer interiors.
- This thing is broken.
- The kind of home that you deserve.
- It's not even plugged in.
- That's very smooth, however you did all this.
But you gotta do better than that.
Yeah... you gotta do a lot better than that... to get to me.
Have to do a whole lot better than that to get to me.
Whoever you are.
Don't worry about who I am, Joe.
You won't even remember me tomorrow.
But remember this:
Look at the real price before you close the deal.
- What's that supposed to mean?
- You know what it means.
Listen to your heart.
Do what it tells you.
You'll find your way.
Hark!
I hear Joseph and Mary in the manger.
Hark!
I hear Joseph and Mary in the manger.
Hark!
I hear Joseph and Mary in the manger.
- Where's Joseph and Mary?
Ohhh.
See the infant, meek and mild.
He is God's anointed child.
So celebrate this Christmas morn.
For on this day, His son is born!
Julia.
I wanted to see you to say good-bye.
No, no. I'll call the council and tell them that we still need you.
Well, this is over the council's head.
Way over their head.
Besides, it's time.
How can it be time?
It just is.
It's funny, you know,
I spent the last 30 years... thinking I'd be happy if I could just get back to this place.
Here? The council must send you to some dead neighborhoods.
Well, dead is relative.
But now I know where I belong.
Is this because of me?
No. Mmm.
Well, maybe just a little bit.
You remember when you asked me what you do... when the flame between two people goes out?
Yes.
The answer is:
You don't let it.
Will we ever see you again?
I don't know.
Well, let's see.
No. Not again.
% Or maybe a fisherman%
% Out on the sea%
- How can I thank you?
- You already have.
- God bless you.
- Thank you.

Come on.
- Mommy, was I good?
- Oh! The best donkey.
I'll do it.
- Not bad, man.
Oh, yes!
"Christmas is supposed to be...
"the most joyous day of the year.
Amen!
But for St. Matthew's, today is..."
"For St. Matt's... today is supposed..."
Beloved...
God never promised us a perfect life.
Amen!
He's saving that for the hereafter.
- Oh, no!
- Amen!
While we're here on... on this Earth... there's some things we just got to work for.
- Am I right about this?
- Yeah!
- He's not following the script.
- He's doing fine.
- It could be a job.
- Uh-huh.
- It could be a church.
- Amen!
- It could be a community.
- Amen!
- Could be a marriage.
- Amen!
But the good news is... is that He gave us... two secret weapons to help us to succeed.
- Hope...
- Hope!
- And love.
- And love!
- Hope.
- Hope.
- That's all a prayer is.
- And love.
- Love!
- Loving is giving...
- Yeah!
- Pure and simple.
- Amen!
But in love, there is also forgiveness.
- And forgiveness... belongs to everyone.
- It's a right.
- Yeah!
- Like a right to breathe or eat.
- Yeah!
Or even to fall in love.
Amen!
Sometimes we... we take love for granted.
- Am I right about it?
Those who are nearest to us... dearest to us... those are the ones we forget to cherish.
But the miracle is... when we love someone... we are really loving God.
Look in wonder at those you love... for they are the face of God.
- Hallelujah.
- Hallelujah.
And when the path is dark...
- Amen.
- And the road bends... we will let the Lord show us the way.
- He will give us heart and make us whole.
- Amen!
You see, I know... because He did me!
- Yeah!
- You may ask me, "How?"
How?
You see, He's...
You see,
He's got these angels...
- Yeah.
- Waitin' on this long line... for the chance to come down and help each and every one of us!
- And they do!
- Yes!
So you see, beloved, today I am truly blessed.
- Blessed with hope,
- Hope!
- Blessed with love...
- Love!
And blessed with a belief that I can make a difference!
- All of us can!
We can save this church!
- Yeah!
- He's got a point.
- We will help our poor!
- Oh, yes!
- We will help our young!
- All right!
- And our lonely and our needy!
So now let us begin again.
Let us go forward.
- Forward in hope, forward in love...
- Hope! Love!
And forward into the new days of our lives!
Put your hands together and praise God!
- Whoo!
Praise Him! Hallelujah!

- Merry Christmas, Saul.
- Merry Christmas, Henry, Julia.
- You still going to be a member in the spring?
Member? I'm planning on getting married in this church.
- To who?
- Who do you think?
- You're my little lamb dumpling.
- We're gonna have a daddy?
- Did he say "lamb dumpling"?
I can't believe you said that to the pastor.
Oh, well, the pastor's gonna have to get himself a new secretary.
- I'm gonna have to pray on that.
- Joe, Merry Christmas.
You belong here, Henry. Call me Monday.
We'll work that mortgage thing out.
That's wonderful.
- Call me.
- I will.
Henry, you did it!
No, honey, we did.
- Good sermon, Reverend.
- Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
- Who's that?
- I don't know.
Maybe he's new in the neighborhood.
Come on, boys!
Let's go!
Hey, Merry Christmas, Dudley.
Merry Christmas to you, too, Jeremiah.
Lunch and presents. Come on, boys!
Jeremiah, give me your hand, honey.
Mom, did you get Dudley a present?
Jeremiah, who is Dudley, baby?
- Ma, you know Dudley.
- Come on, boys, let's go get some soup.
That was a long time ago. At least a year.
Before Hakim came to live with us for good.
Wow!
And became my real brother.
It's beautiful!
You must've sat up with that all night, baby.
- Mama, you didn't.
- With my back?
My parents still think I made Dudley up.
They say,
"If he's so real, then where is he?"
But just like I told Daddy... just because you can't see the air... doesn't stop you from breathing.
And just 'cause you can't see God... it don't stop you from believing.
Then Daddy smiled and said...
"Son, that's what we call faith."

How does it feel to be back on the Enterprise Bridge?
Captain Kirk?
- Can I ask you a few questions?
- Did you participate in the redesign?
We'd like to know how you feel about being on...
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.
There will be plenty of time for questions later.
I'm Captain John Harriman, and I'd like to welcome you all aboard.
- It's our pleasure.
- I just want you to know how excited we all are to have a group of living legends with us on our maiden voyage.
I remember reading about your missions when I was in grade school.
Really?
- Well, may we have a look around?
- Please, please.
Yes, sir, it's very nice to finally meet you.
- Demora!
- Excuse me. Captain?
This is the first Starship Enterprise in 30 years without James T. Kirk in command.
How do you feel about that, sir?
Just fine. I'm glad to be here to send her on her way.
And what have you been doing since you retired?
Keeping busy.
Captain Kirk, just a few more questions, sir.
Why don't we give the Captain a chance to look around first?
Captain. Excuse me.
I'd like you to meet the helmsman of the Enterprise-B. Demora.
Ensign Demora Sulu.
It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.
My father's told me some interesting stories about you.
- Your father is Hikaru Sulu?
- Yes, sir.
- You've met her before, but she was...
- It wasn't that long ago.
- It couldn't have been more than...
- Twelve years, sir.
- Twelve years?
- Absolutely.
Incredible.
Congratulations, Ensign.
It wouldn't be the Enterprise without a Sulu at the helm.
Thank you, sir.
I'm sure Hikaru must be very proud of you.
I hope so.
I was never that young.
No, you were younger.
- Damn fine ship if you ask me.
- Scotty, it absolutely amazes me.
And what would that be, sir?
Sulu, when did he find time for a family?
Well, like you always say, if something's important, you make the time.
So that's why you seem so restless.
Finding retirement a little lonely, are we?
You know, I'm glad you're an engineer.
With tact like that, you'd make a lousy psychiatrist.
Excuse me, gentlemen, if you'll take your seats.
Yes, of course.
Prepare to leave spacedock.
Aft thrusters ahead one-quarter, port and starboard at station keeping.
- Captain Kirk.
- Yes?
I'd be honored if you'd give the order to get underway.
- Thank you very much, I...
- Please, sir.
- No, no, no, no.
- Please, I insist.
Take us out.
- Very good, sir.
- Brought a tear to me eye.
Be quiet.
Gentlemen, gentlemen.
Now that you've seen the rest of the ship, how does it feel to be back?
- Well, we... Fine.
- Fine, fine.
- Fine, fine.
- Well, ladies and gentlemen, we've just cleared the asteroid belt.
Our course today will take us out beyond Pluto and then back to spacedock.
Just a quick run around the block.
Captain, will there be time to conduct any tests on the warp drive system?
We're picking up a distress call,
Captain.
On speakers.
This is the transport ship Lakul.
We're caught in some kind of energy distortion.
Two ships in our convoy... trapped in a severe gravimetric distortion.
We can't break free.
We need immediate help.
It's tearing us apart.
This is the transport...
The Lakul is one of two ships transporting El-Aurian refugees to Earth.
Ensign Sulu, can you locate them?
The ships are bearing at 3-1-0 mark 2-1-5.
Distance, three light-years.
Signal the closest starship.
We're in no condition to mount a rescue.
- We don't even have a full crew aboard.
- We're the only one in range, sir.
Well, then, I guess it's up to us.
Helm, lay in an intercept course and engage at maximum warp.
Aye, sir.
Captain, is there something wrong with your chair?
We're within visual range of the energy distortion, Captain.
On screen.
What the hell is that?
I've located the transport ships.
Their hulls are starting to buckle under the stress.
They won't survive much longer.
We're encountering severe gravimetric distortions from the energy ribbon, Captain.
We'll have to keep our distance.
We don't wanna get pulled in, too.
- Tractor beam. Tractor beam.
- We don't have a tractor beam.
You left spacedock without a tractor beam?
It won't be installed until Tuesday.
Ensign Sulu, try generating a subspace field around the ships.
That might break them free.
There's too much quantum interference,
Captain.
What about... What about venting plasma from the warp nacelles?
That might disrupt the ribbon's hold on the ships.
Aye, sir. Releasing drive plasma.
It's not having any effect, sir.
I think the ribbon's hold...
Sir, the starboard vessel's hull is collapsing!
- How many people were on that ship?
- Two hundred and sixty-five.
Sir, the Lakul's hull integrity is down to 12%.
Captain Kirk, I would appreciate any suggestions you might have.
First, move us within transporter range.
Beam those people aboard the Enterprise.
What about the gravimetric distortions?
They'll tear us apart.
Risk is part of the game if you wanna sit in that chair.
Helm, close to within transporter range.
Second, turn that damn thing off!
- We're within range, sir.
- Beam them directly to Sickbay.
- Aye, sir.
- How big is your medical staff?
The medical staff?
It doesn't arrive till Tuesday.
You and you, you've just become nurses. Let's go.
Main Engineering reports fluctuations in the warp plasma relays.
Sir, I'm having trouble locking on to them.
They appear to be in some sort of temporal flux.
Scotty!
What the hell?
Their life signs are phasing in and out of our space-time continuum.
Phasing? To where?
- Sir, their hull's collapsing!
- Beam them out of there, Scotty!
Transport complete.
I got 47 out of 150.
- Report!
- We're caught in a gravimetric field emanating from the trailing edge of the ribbon.
All engines, full reverse!
It's going to be all right.
We're going to help you.
We are going to help you.
- It's okay. Everything is fine.
- My wife...
Why? Why?
It's all right. You're safe.
You're on the Enterprise.
- No, no, I have to go. I have to go back.
- You need to stay right here.
- No. You don't understand.
- It's okay.
Let me go back. Let me go back!
Let me go back.
Let me go back. Please!
- What was he talking about?
- I have no idea.
Excuse me.
Can I help you?
It's going to be okay. You'll be all right.
You just need to rest. Come over here.
There's just no way to disrupt a gravimetric field of this magnitude.
- Hull integrity at 82%.
- But I do have a theory.
I thought you might.
An antimatter discharge directly ahead might disrupt the field long enough for us to break away.
- Photon torpedoes.
- Aye.
We're losing main power.
Load torpedo bays.
Prepare to fire at my command.
- Captain, we don't have any torpedoes.
- Don't tell me, Tuesday.
- Hull integrity at 40%.
- Captain, it may be possible to simulate a torpedo blast using a resonance burst from the main deflector dish.
- Where are the deflector relays?
- Deck 15, Section 21-Alpha.
I'll go. You have the Bridge.
Wait.
Your place is on the bridge of your ship.
I'll take care of it.
Scotty, keep things together until I get back.
I always do.
Forty-five seconds to structural collapse.
Bridge to Captain Kirk.
Kirk here.
I don't know how much longer
I can hold her together.
That's it. Let's go!
Activate main deflector.
We're breaking free.
It's all right.
I'm increasing power to compensate.
- We're clear.
- You did it, Kirk!
Damage report, Ensign.
There's some buckling on the starboard nacelle.
We've also got a hull breach in Engineering section.
Emergency force fields in place and holding.
Where?
Sections 20 through 28 on Decks 13, 14 and 15.
Bridge to Captain Kirk.
Captain Kirk, please respond.
Have Chekov meet me on Deck 15.
My God! Was anyone in here?
Aye.
Bring out the prisoner.
Mr. Worf,
I always knew this day would come.
- Are you prepared to face the charges?
- Answer him.
I am prepared.
"We, the officers and crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise,
"being of sound mind and judgment,
"hereby make the following charges against Lieutenant Worf.
"One, that he did knowingly and willfully
"perform above and beyond the call of duty on countless occasions.
"Two, most seriously,
"that he has earned the admiration and respect of the entire crew."
Mr. Worf, I hereby promote you to the rank of Lieutenant Commander, with all the rights and privileges thereto.
And may God have mercy on your soul.
- Hip, hip...
- Hooray!
- Hip, hip...
- Hooray!
- Hip, hip...
- Hooray!
- Congratulations, Mr. Worf.
- Thank you, sir.
Extend the plank.
Lower the badge of office.
- Be careful.
- You go get that hat.
He'll never make it. No one ever has.
Jump!
Yes! Yes, Worf!
If there's one thing I've learned over the years, it's never to underestimate a Klingon.
Computer, remove the plank.
Oh, no!
Number One, that's "retract" plank, not "remove" plank.
Of course, sir.
Sorry.
Doctor, I must confess,
I am uncertain as to why someone falling into freezing water is amusing.
It's all in good fun, Data.
- Fun?
- Fun.
I do not understand.
You've got to get into the spirit of things.
Learn to be spontaneous, live in the moment.
- Do something unexpected. Get it?
- Got it.
- Data.
- That was...
Not funny.
All hands, make sail.
T'gansuls and courses.
- Stand by the braces.
- Will.
Just imagine what it was like.
No engines, no computers, just the wind and the sea and the stars to guide you.
Bad food, brutal discipline.
No women.
- Bridge to Captain Picard.
- Picard here.
There's a personal message for you from Earth.
Put it through down here.
The best thing about life at sea, Will, was that no one could reach you.
This was freedom, Will.
Computer, arch.
Look alive there.
Here, take the wheel.
Captain, are you all right?
Yes, I'm fine. Excuse me.
Computer, exit.
- Mr. La Forge, set royals and studsail.
- What's a studsail, sir?
You see that last yardarm?
Just above that...
- Bridge to Holodeck 3.
- Riker here.
We're picking up a distress call from the Amargosa Observatory, sir.
They say they're under attack.
Red alert! All hands to battle stations.
Captain Picard to the Bridge.
- It looks like we're too late.
- There are no other ships in the system.
Captain, we're approaching Amargosa.
Looks like the observatory took quite a beating.
Survivors?
Sensors show five life signs aboard the station, Captain.
The station's complement was 19.
Stand down from red alert.
Number One, will you begin an investigation?
I'll be in my Ready Room.
- Sir? I thought you wanted...
- Make it so. Just do it!
- Mr. Worf.
- Aye, sir.
Mr. Worf, you're with me.
These blast patterns are consistent with a type-3 disruptor.
Great. That narrows it down to Romulan, Breen and Klingon.
Over here!
It's all right. Do not struggle.
It's okay. We're right here. Got you.
I'm Commander William Riker from the Starship Enterprise.
Soran. Dr. Tolian Soran.
- Who attacked you, Doctor?
- I don't know. It all happened so fast.
Commander, you better take a look at this.
Romulans.
Data, whatever possessed you to push her in the water in the first place?
I was attempting to get into the spirit of things.
I thought it would be amusing. Spot.
Is she still angry?
I'd stay out of Sickbay for a couple of days if I were you.
Data, you're not actually thinking about using that thing, are you?
I have considered it for many months.
And in light of my recent episode with Dr. Crusher, now may be the appropriate time.
I thought you were worried about it overloading your neural net.
That is true.
However, I believe my growth as an artificial life-form has reached an impasse.
For 34 years, I have endeavored to become more human, to grow beyond my original programming.
Still, I am unable to grasp such a basic concept as humor.
This emotion chip may be the only answer.
Geordi.
All right.
Listen, at the first sign of trouble,
I'm gonna deactivate it. Agreed?
Agreed.
We found two dead Romulans on the station.
We're analyzing their equipment to see if we can determine what ship they came from.
And there's still no indication of why they attacked the station?
They practically tore the place apart.
Accessed the central computer, turned the cargo bay inside out.
Obviously, they were looking for something.
This could signify a new Romulan threat in this sector.
- Inform Starfleet Command.
- You want me to contact Starfleet?
- Is there a problem?
- No, sir.
There was something else, Captain.
One of the scientists, a Dr. Soran, insisted on speaking with you.
I told him you were very busy.
He said it was absolutely imperative that he speak with you right away.
Understood. That will be all.
- Sir, is there anything more...
- No, thank you.
Gentlemen, something new from Forcas III?
What?
I believe this beverage has produced an emotional response.
Really? What are you feeling?
I am uncertain.
Because I have had little experience with emotion,
I am unable to articulate the sensation.
- Emotion?
- I'll explain later.
- Well, it looks like he hates it.
- Yes, that is it.
- I hate this.
- Data, I think the chip is working.
Yes, I hate this. It is revolting.
- More?
- Please.
I'm looking for a Dr. Soran from the observatory.
- Dr. Soran?
- Yes.
Yes, Captain, thank you for coming.
Thank you.
I understand there's something urgent you wish to discuss with me.
Yes. I must return to the observatory immediately.
I must continue a critical experiment
I've been running on the Amargosa star.
We're still conducting our investigation into the attack.
- Yes, I...
- As soon as that is complete, then I will allow you and your colleagues to return.
But until then, there's nothing I can do.
Timing is very important in my experiments.
If it's not completed in the next 12 hours, years of research will be lost.
We're doing the best we can.
If you'll excuse me.
They say time is the fire in which we burn.
Right now, Captain, my time is running out.
We leave so many things unfinished in our lives.
I know you understand.
I'll see what I can do.
We have analyzed the Romulans' tricorder.
They were scanning for signature particles
- of a compound called trilithium.
- Trilithium?
Yes, an experimental compound the Romulans have been working on.
Trilithium is a nuclear inhibitor.
In theory, it could stop all fusion within a star.
However, the Romulans never found a way to stabilize it.
Why would they look for it on a Federation observatory?
That doesn't make any sense.
I do not know.
Have Geordi and Data go over with the next away team.
Tell them to scan the observatory for trilithium.
Aye, sir.
Well, there's no sign of any trilithium over here.
- I get it! I get it!
- You get what?
When you said to Commander Riker,
"The clown can stay,
"but the Ferengi in the gorilla suit has to go."
What are you talking about?
During the Farpoint mission.
We were on the Bridge. You told a joke.
That was the punch line.
Farpoint...
Data, that was seven years ago.
I know. I just got it!
Very funny.
Wait a minute.
There's a door hidden right behind you.
I can see the separation with my visor.
There appears to be a dampening field in operation.
I cannot scan beyond the bulkhead.
There doesn't seem to be a control panel or an access port.
It appears to be magnetically sealed.
I believe I can reverse the polarity by attenuating my axial servo.
Open sesame.
You could say
I have a magnetic personality.
Humor, I love it!
Data, come take a look at this, will you?
Have you ever seen a solar probe with this kind of configuration?
No, Geordi, I have not. Have you?
No, I have not. It is most unusual.
Mr. Tricorder.
Just see if you can help me get these panels open, will you?
Make it so.
My visor's picking up something in the theta band.
It could be a trilithium signature.
- Data, we don't have time for this.
- I cannot help myself.
I think something is wrong.
Data?
Data. Data, are you all right?
I believe the emotion chip has overloaded my positronic relay.
We'd better get you back to the ship.
La Forge to Enterprise.
- La Forge to Enterprise.
- Gentlemen, is there a problem?
Dr. Soran.
Yeah. There seems to be some sort of dampening field in here.
It's blocking our comm signal.
Can you shut it off for us?
Of course, I'd be only too happy to.
Please. Please. No.
Do not... Do not hurt me.
Please, please.
Yes, come.
Yes, Counselor?
Is there something I can do for you?
Actually I'm here to see if there's anything I can do for you.
It's just family matters.
You never met my brother and his wife, did you?
- No.
- Robert.
So opinionated.
So pompous and arrogant.
He always had to have the last word.
But he mellowed a little bit in the last few years.
I was going to get together with them all next month on Earth.
I thought we'd go to San Francisco.
René's always wanted to see Starfleet Academy.
René? Your nephew.
Yes. He's so unlike his father.
He's a dreamer, imaginative.
He's so very gentle.
What's happened?
Robert and René, they're...
Burned to death in a fire.
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right. It's all right.
These things happen.
Captain, it's not all right.
I can't help thinking about all the experiences that René's not gonna have, about going to the Academy, reading books and listening to music and falling in love, building a life.
Well, that's not going to happen now.
I didn't realize he meant so much to you.
I'd come to feel that René was as close as I would get to having a child of my own.
Your family history is very important to you, isn't it?
What?
From being a small child,
I can remember being told about the family line.
The Picard who fought at Trafalgar.
The Picard who won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry.
The Picards who settled the first Martian colonies.
And when Robert married and he had a son, I...
You felt it was no longer your responsibility to carry on the family line.
Right. Yes. That's it exactly.
You know, Counselor, recently I've become very much aware that there were fewer days ahead than there are behind, but I took some comfort from the fact that the family would go on.
But now there'll be no more Picards.
Report.
A quantum implosion has occurred within the Amargosa star.
- All nuclear fusion is breaking down.
- How is that possible?
Sensor records show the observatory launched a solar probe into the sun a few moments ago.
The star is going to collapse in a matter of minutes.
Sir, the implosion has produced a level-12 shock wave.
That'll destroy everything in this system.
Transporter Room to Bridge.
I can't locate Commander La Forge or Mr. Data, sir.
- Have they come back to the ship?
- No, sir. They are not on board.
How long before the shock wave hits the observatory?
Four minutes, 40 seconds.
Number One.
- Mr. Worf!
- Aye, sir.
Soran, transmit your coordinates.
What the hell's he doing?
Enterprise to Commander Riker.
You have two minutes left.
You hear that, Soran?
We've got a level-12 shock wave coming in. We gotta get out of here!
Sir, a Klingon bird-of-prey is decloaking off the port bow.
What?
- Data, see if you can get to Geordi.
- I cannot, sir.
Prepare for transport.
- Commander Riker's team is aboard, sir.
- Helm, warp 1, engage!
You've done it, Soran.
Wait!
I hope for your sake you were initiating a mating ritual.
You got careless.
The Romulans came looking for their missing trilithium.
Impossible.
We left no survivors on their outpost.
They knew it was on the observatory.
If the Enterprise hadn't intervened, they would have found it.
They didn't find it! And now we have a weapon of unlimited power.
No, Lursa, I have the weapon, and if you ever want me to give it to you,
I would advise you to be a little more careful in the future.
Perhaps we are tired of waiting.
Without my research, the trilithium is worthless, as are your plans to re-conquer the Klingon Empire.
Set course for the Veridian system.
Maximum warp.
He's an El-Aurian, over 300 years old.
He lost his entire family when the Borg destroyed his planet.
Soran escaped with a handful of other refugees aboard a ship called the Lakul.
That ship was later destroyed by some kind of energy ribbon.
But Soran and 46 others were rescued by the Enterprise-B.
That was the mission where James Kirk was killed.
I checked the passenger manifest of the Lakul.
Guess who else was on board.
Soran is a name I haven't heard for a long time.
- You remember him?
- Yes.
Guinan, it is very important that you tell me everything that you know.
We think that Soran has developed a weapon, a terrible weapon, one that might even give him enough power to destroy an entire...
Soran doesn't care about weapons or power.
He just cares about getting back to the Nexus.
What is the Nexus?
The energy ribbon that destroyed that ship was not just some random phenomena traveling through the universe.
It's a doorway to another place that we call the Nexus, and it's a place I've tried very, very hard to forget.
What happened to you?
It was like being inside joy.
As if joy was something tangible and you could wrap yourself up in it like a blanket, and never in my entire life have I ever been as content.
And then you were beamed away from there.
Pulled. Ripped away.
None of us wanted to go, and I would have done anything, anything to get back there.
And once I realized that wasn't possible,
I learned to live with that.
What about Soran?
If he's still obsessed, he could be a very, very dangerous man.
Why would he destroy a star?
Thank you, Guinan.
If you go, you're not gonna care about anything.
Not this ship, not Soran, not me.
Nothing.
All you'll want is to stay in the Nexus, and you're not gonna want to come back.
Marvelous technology.
This is a remarkable piece of equipment.
- Glad you approve.
- It's not very stylish, though, is it?
Have you ever considered a prosthesis that would make you look a little more...
How can I say? More normal?
- What's normal?
- What's normal?
Well, that's a good question.
Normal is what everyone else is and you are not.
Can we just get down to it, please?
What do you want?
As you may or may not be aware,
I am an El-Aurian.
Some people call us a race of listeners.
We listen.
Right now, Mr. La Forge, you have my complete attention.
I want to listen to everything you know about trilithium.
Captain's Log, Stardate 48632.4.
Dr. Crusher has informed me that Data's emotion chip has been fused into his neural net and cannot be removed.
However, she believes he is fit for duty, so I've asked him to join me in Stellar Cartography.
According to our information, the ribbon is a conflux of temporal energy which travels through this galaxy every 39.1 years.
It will pass through this sector in approximately 42 hours.
Yes. Guinan was right.
She said that Soran was trying to get back to the ribbon.
Now, if that's true, there has to be some connection with the Amargosa star.
Data, give me a list of anything that was affected by the star's destruction, no matter how insignificant.
- Data?
- Sorry, sir.
It will take the computer a few moments to compile the information.
Data, are you all right?
No, sir.
I am finding it difficult to concentrate.
I believe I am overwhelmed with feelings of remorse and regret concerning my actions on the observatory.
What do you mean?
I wanted to save Geordi, but I experienced something I did not expect.
Fear.
I was afraid.
According to our current information, the destruction of the Amargosa star has had the following effects in this sector.
Gamma emissions have increased by.05%.
The Starship Bozeman was forced to make a course correction.
Ambient magnetic fields...
Wait. The Bozeman, why would it make a course correction?
The destruction of the Amargosa star has altered the gravitational forces throughout this sector.
As a result, any ship passing through this region would have to make a minor course correction.
A minor course correction.
Where's the ribbon now?
- This is its current position.
- Can you project its course?
Captain.
I cannot continue with this investigation.
I wish to be deactivated until Dr. Crusher can remove the emotion chip.
Are you having some kind of malfunction?
No, sir. I simply do not have the ability to control these emotions.
Data, I have nothing but sympathy for what you are feeling, but right now, I need you to...
Sir, I no longer want these emotions!
Deactivating me is the only viable solution.
Part of having feelings is learning to integrate them into your life, Data, learning to live with them
- no matter what the circumstances.
- Sir, I cannot!
You will not be deactivated.
You're an officer on board this ship, and I require you to perform your duty.
That is an order, Commander.
Yes, sir.
I will try, sir.
Sometimes it takes courage to try, Data, and courage can be an emotion, too.
Now, can you project the course of the ribbon?
I believe so.
Enhance grid 9-A.
Where was the Amargosa star?
Now, you said that when the Amargosa star was destroyed, it affected the gravitational forces in this sector.
Now, did the computer take that into account when it projected the course of the ribbon?
No, sir.
I will make the appropriate adjustments.
That's what Soran's doing.
He's changing the course of the ribbon.
But why?
Why would he try to change its path?
Why doesn't he just fly into it with a ship?
Our records show that every ship which has approached the ribbon has either been destroyed or severely damaged.
He can't get to the ribbon, so he's trying to make the ribbon come to him.
Data, does it pass near to any M-Class planets?
Yes, sir.
There are two in the Veridian system.
Well, it gets close to Veridian III, but not close enough.
Data, what would happen to the ribbon's course if Soran destroyed the Veridian star itself?
That's where he's going.
It should be noted, sir, that the collapse of the Veridian star would produce a shock wave similar to the one we observed at Amargosa.
Destroying all the planets in this system.
Veridian III is uninhabited.
However, Veridian IV supports a pre-industrial humanoid society.
Population?
Two hundred thirty million, sir.
- Picard to Bridge.
- Worf here, sir.
Set a course for the Veridian system, maximum warp.
Did you get anything from the human?
No. His heart just wasn't in it.
We have entered orbit of Veridian III.
- Prepare to transport me to the surface.
- Wait. When do we get our payment?
This contains all the information you'll need to make a trilithium weapon.
It's been coded.
Once I'm safely to the surface,
I'll transmit the decryption sequence to you.
- Not before.
- Mistress!
A Federation starship is entering the system.
What? On viewer.
They're hailing us.
We're still cloaked. They can't see us.
Klingon vessel, we know what you are doing, and we will destroy any probe launched toward the Veridian star.
We demand that you return our chief engineer and leave this system immediately.
There's no time for this. Eliminate them.
That is a Galaxy-class starship.
We're no match for them.
I think it's time we gave Mr. La Forge his sight back.
Maybe they're not out there.
They're just trying to decide if a 20-year-old Klingon bird-of-prey can be a match for the Federation flagship.
- Perhaps they're on the surface.
- Sir, according to my calculations, a solar probe launched from either the Klingon ship or the planet surface will take 11 seconds to reach the sun.
However, since we do not have an exact point of origin, it will take us between 8 and 15 seconds to lock our weapons onto it.
- That's a pretty big margin of error.
- Much too big.
Mr. Data, how long before the ribbon arrives?
Approximately 47 minutes, sir.
We have got to find some way to get to Soran.
Klingon vessel decloaking directly ahead, sir.
- They are hailing.
- On screen.
Captain. What an unexpected pleasure.
Lursa, it is very important that I speak with Soran.
I'm afraid the doctor is no longer aboard our ship.
- Then I will beam to his location.
- The doctor values his privacy.
He would be quite upset if an armed away team interrupted him.
Then I will beam to your ship and you can transport me to Soran.
We can't trust them.
For all we know, they killed Geordi.
They might kill you, too.
We did not harm your engineer.
He's been our guest.
Then return him!
- In exchange for what?
- Me, sir.
Me. I will be your prisoner.
But first, you must beam me to the surface so that I can speak with Soran.
The Captain would make a much more valuable hostage.
- We'll consider it a prisoner exchange.
- Agreed.
Have Dr. Crusher meet me in Transporter Room 3.
You have the Bridge, Number One.
- Receiving the coordinates, Captain.
- Energize.
Welcome, Captain.
- You must think I'm quite the madman.
- The thought had crossed my mind.
I know why you're here.
You're not entirely confident you can shoot down my probe, so you've come to dissuade me from my horrific plan. Good luck.
Now, if you'll excuse me, Captain,
I'm rather busy.
Soran.
Do be careful, Captain.
That's a 50-gigawatt force field.
I wouldn't want to see you get hurt.
I have established the link.
Put it on viewer.
It's working. The visor's transmitting.
Where is he?
Human females are so repulsive.
...and some myocardial degeneration.
I've removed the nanoprobe, and I think you're going to be fine.
I'll need to run some more tests.
I'll let you know.
Thanks, Doc.
- Geordi...
- Data, it's okay.
I am sorry I let you down.
I have not been behaving like myself lately.
No, Data, you haven't.
You've been behaving like a human.
You don't have to do this, Soran.
I'm sure we can find another way of getting you into this Nexus.
I've spent 80 years looking for another way.
Believe me, this is the only one.
What you're about to do, Soran, is no different from when the Borg destroyed your world.
They killed millions, too, including your wife, children.
Nice try.
You know, there was a time when I wouldn't hurt a fly.
Then the Borg came, and they showed me that if there is one constant in this whole universe, it's death.
Afterwards, I began to realize it didn't really matter.
We're all gonna die sometime.
It's just a question of how and when.
You will, too, Captain.
Aren't you beginning to feel time gaining on you?
It's like a predator. It's stalking you.
You can try and outrun it with doctors, medicines, new technologies, but in the end, time is going to hunt you down and make the kill.
It's our mortality that defines us, Soran.
It's part of the truth of our existence.
- What if I told you I found a new truth?
- The Nexus?
Time has no meaning there.
The predator has no teeth.
- Where is he now?
- I don't know.
He bathed. Now he's roaming the ship.
He must be the only engineer in Starfleet who doesn't go to Engineering.
- Any luck, Mr. Worf?
- No, sir. I still cannot locate the Captain.
Data, the sensors can't penetrate the planet's ionosphere.
There's too much interference.
Can you find a way to scan for life-forms?
I would be happy to, sir.
I just love scanning for life-forms.
Life-forms
You tiny little life-forms
You precious little life-forms
Where are you?
Finally.
Commander, I'd like to run a level 3 diagnostic on the port plasma relays.
I think one of the generators is fluctuating.
Fine. Let's do that.
That's it! Replay from time index 924.
Magnify this section and enhance.
Their shields are operating on a modulation of 257.4.
Adjust our torpedo frequency to match.
They have found a way to penetrate our shields.
Lock phasers and return fire!
Deanna, take the helm.
Get us out of orbit!
Hull breach on Decks 31 through 35.
Mr. Worf, what do we know about that old Klingon ship?
- Any weaknesses?
- It's a Class-D12 bird-of-prey.
They were retired from service because of defective plasma coils.
Plasma coils? Is there any way we can use that to our advantage?
I do not see how. The plasma coil is part of their cloaking device.
Let's get a stabilizer on that conduit.
Reinforce that starboard interlock.
We need to re-route main power through the secondary coupling.
Data, would a defective plasma coil be susceptible to some sort of ionic pulse?
Perhaps. Yes, yes.
If we sent a low-level ionic pulse, it might reset the coil and trigger their cloaking device.
Excellent idea, sir!
As their cloak begins to engage, their shields will drop.
They'll have two seconds of vulnerability. Mr. Data,
- lock on to plasma coil.
- No problem.
- Our shields are holding.
- Fire at will.
Mr. Worf, prepare a spread of photon torpedoes.
We have to hit them the instant they begin to cloak.
- Aye, sir.
- We get one shot at this.
Target their primary reactor.
I have accessed their core frequency.
Initiating ionic pulse.
Make it quick!
- Target their bridge.
- Full disruptors.
- We are cloaking.
- What?
Our shields are down!
Fire.
Yes!
Haven't you got anything better to do?
Must have been that last torpedo.
La Forge to Bridge.
I've got a problem down here.
The magnetic interlocks have been ruptured. I...
Coolant leak!
We have a coolant leak, everybody.
Let's go. Let's get out of here.
Everybody out. Let's move!
Let's move! We've gotta go!
- Quick!
- Evacuate! Evacuate!
Bridge, we have a new problem.
We're five minutes from a warp core breach.
There's nothing I can do.
Deanna, evacuate everyone to the saucer section.
Mr. Data, prepare to separate the ship.
Starship separation in five minutes.
- We're going straight down.
- Everyone move. Take Corridor A.
Starship separation in four minutes, 45 seconds.
All right, let's move him out. Let's go.
Take him out, quick.
Starship separation in four minutes, 30 seconds.
- Keep moving, everyone. Keep going.
- Here we go, Rose, this way.
Starship separation in four minutes, 15 seconds.
- Hurry!
- Keep moving.
- Farrell!
- Yes?
There's no one here with these kids.
Let's get them to the Jefferies tube.
- Come on, sweetie.
- We'll find their parents later.
Starship separation in four minutes.
Now you'll have to excuse me, Captain.
I have an appointment with eternity, and I don't want to be late.
The core breach is accelerating, Geordi.
We've gotta get out of here.
- That's it, Bridge. We're all out.
- One minute to warp core breach.
Begin separation sequence.
Full impulse power once we're clear.
Warp core is going critical.
- Separation complete.
- Engaging impulse engines.
Core breach in progress.
Primary stabilizers off-line.
Engaging secondary systems.
- Report!
- Helm controls are off-line!
Oh, shit!
Here we go. Right around this corner!
Come and help me. Help me.
Just keep moving.
- On the ground.
- Everybody on the bed!
I have re-routed auxiliary power to the lateral thrusters.
Attempting to level our descent.
All hands, brace for impact!
- Hold on, everybody. Hold on tight.
- Hold their heads.
I'm okay.
What... What is this? Where am I?
- Surprise!
- We love you, Father.
- Were you scared?
- Look at the tree.
- I helped decorate it.
- It took all day.
- Say, "Merry Christmas," Papa.
- See the presents?
- I love you, Father.
- I love you, too.
Come on, children. Let's move back and give your father some room.
- Cup of Earl Grey?
- That would be perfect.
- This one's for you.
- Thank you very much, René.
- Merry Christmas, Uncle.
- And Merry Christmas to you, too.
René, can you help me with the table?
René!
Come here.
Go help your aunt.
Did you get anything else?
This isn't right.
- This can't be real.
- It's as real as you want it to be.
Guinan, what's going on?
- Why am I here?
- You're in the Nexus.
- This is the Nexus?
- For you. This is what you wanted.
But I never had a home like this.
Nor a wife and children, but these are all mine.
Guinan, what are you doing here?
I thought you were on board the Enterprise.
I am. I'm also here.
Think of me as an echo of the person you know, a part of herself she left behind.
When the Enterprise-B beamed you up from the Lakul.
- Papa, help me build my castle.
- Yes, I will in a few minutes.
Papa, thank you for the dolly.
She's very beautiful.
These are my children.
These are my children.
Of course. Time has no meaning here, so you can go back and see them born or go forward and see your grandchildren.
Dinner's ready, everyone.
- Yay!
- Yay!
Mama, can I...
- Dinner's ready, Papa.
- Yes, of course. Come on, Thomas.
It's your favorite.
Go on. Go on without me.
Guinan, can I leave the Nexus?
- Where would you go?
- I don't understand.
Well, as I said, time has no meaning here.
So, if you leave, you can go anywhere, any time.
All right,
I know exactly where I want to go.
To the mountaintop on Veridian III just before Soran destroyed the star.
I have to stop him, but I need help.
Now, if you were to come back with me, together...
I can't leave.
I'm there already, remember?
But I bet I know someone who can.
And from his point of view, he just got here, too.
Kirk.
James T. Kirk.
Beautiful day.
Yes, it certainly is.
Would you mind?
Captain, I'm wondering, do you realize...
Hold on a minute.
Do you smell something burning?
Looks like somebody was trying to cook some eggs. Come on in.
It's all right. It's my house.
At least it used to be.
I sold it years ago.
I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Starship Enterprise.
The clock.
I gave this clock to Bones.
I'm from what you would consider the future, the 24th century.
Butler!
Butler.
How can you be here?
He's been dead seven years.
Come on, Jim. I'm starving.
How long are you gonna be rattling around in that kitchen?
Antonia.
What are you talking about? The future?
This is the past.
This is nine years ago.
The day I told her
I was going back to Starfleet.
And these are Ktarian eggs, her favorite.
I was preparing them to soften the blow.
I know how real this must seem to you, but it's not.
This isn't really your house.
We are both of us caught up in some kind of temporal nexus.
- Dill.
- I beg your pardon?
Dill weed.
In the cabinet, second shelf to the left.
Behind the oregano.
- How long have you been here?
- I don't know.
I was aboard the Enterprise-B in the Deflector Control Room and...
Stir these, will you?
The bulkhead in front of me disappeared, and then I found myself out there, just now, chopping wood right before you walked up.
Thanks.
Look, history records that you died saving the Enterprise-B from an energy ribbon 80 years ago.
You say this is the 24th century?
- And I'm dead?
- Not exactly. As I said,
- this is some kind of temporal nexus.
- Temporal nexus, yes, I heard you.
- I...
- Something is missing.
Captain, look, I need your help.
I want you to leave the Nexus with me.
We have to go back to a planet,
Veridian III.
We have to stop a man called Soran from destroying a star.
Millions of lives are at stake.
You say history considers me dead.
Who am I to argue with history?
You're a Starfleet officer!
You have a duty.
I don't need to be lectured by you.
I was out saving the galaxy when your grandfather was in diapers.
Besides which,
I think the galaxy owes me one.
Oh, yeah.
I was like you once, so worried about duty and obligation
I couldn't see past my own uniform.
And what did it get me?
An empty house.
Not this time.
This time I'm gonna walk up these stairs, march into that bedroom and tell Antonia I want to marry her.
This time it's gonna be different.
- This is not your bedroom.
- No, it's not. It's better.
- Better?
- This is my uncle's barn in Idaho.
I took this horse out for a ride
11 years ago on a spring day.
Like this one.
If I'm right, this is the day I met Antonia.
This Nexus of yours, very clever.
I can start all over again and do things right from day one.
I must have jumped that 50 times.
Scared the hell out of me each time.
Except this time.
Because it isn't real.
Antonia.
She isn't real either, is she?
Nothing here is. Nothing here matters.
You know, maybe this isn't about an empty house.
Maybe it's about that empty chair on the Bridge of the Enterprise.
Ever since I left Starfleet,
I haven't made a difference.
- Captain of the Enterprise?
- That's right.
Close to retirement?
- I'm not planning on it.
- Let me tell you something. Don't.
Don't let them promote you.
Don't let them transfer you.
Don't let them do anything that takes you off the Bridge of that ship, because while you're there you can make a difference.
Come back with me.
Help me stop Soran.
Make a difference again.
Who am I to argue with the captain of the Enterprise?
What's the name of that planet?
- Veridian III?
- Yes.
I take it the odds are against us and the situation is grim.
You could say that.
You know, if Spock were here, he'd say that I was an irrational, illogical human being for taking on a mission like that.
Sounds like fun.
I have re-routed auxiliary power to the lateral thrusters.
Attempting to level our descent.
All hands, brace for impact!
- Just who the hell are you?
- He's James T. Kirk.
Don't you read history?
I've gotta get to the launcher.
- The ribbon will be here in a minute.
- I'll take care of Soran.
Actually, I am familiar with history,
Captain, and if I'm not too much mistaken, you're dead.
I thought you were heading for the launcher.
I changed my mind.
Captain's prerogative.
We need that control pad.
Captain, look.
Where's Soran?
We're running out of time.
Look, the control pad, it's still on the other side.
I'll get it. You go for the launcher.
No, you'll never make that by yourself.
We have to work together.
We are working together. Trust me. Go.
- Good luck, Captain.
- Call me Jim.
Picard!
Get away from that launcher.
Now!
Did we do it? Did we make a difference?
Yes. We made a difference. Thank you.
The least I could do for the captain of the Enterprise.
It was fun.
Oh, my.
Captain's Log, Stardate 48650.1.
Three Starfleet vessels have arrived in orbit and have begun to beam up the Enterprise survivors.
Our casualties were light, but unfortunately, the Enterprise herself cannot be salvaged.
It has been extremely difficult,
Counselor.
Well, then, why did you decide not to remove the emotion chip?
At first, I was unprepared for the unpredictable nature of emotions.
However, having experienced
261 distinct emotional states,
I believe I have learned to control my feelings.
They will no longer control me.
Well, I hope you're successful, Data.
Data, over here. I found something.
One life sign, very faint.
Spot!
I'm very happy to see you, Spot.
Another family reunited.
Data, are you all right?
I am uncertain, Counselor.
I am happy to see Spot, yet I am crying.
Perhaps the chip is malfunctioning.
I think it's working perfectly.
Hello, Spot.
Is this it?
Yes. Yes, that's it, Number One.
Thank you.
I'm gonna miss this ship.
She went before her time.
Someone once told me that time was a predator that stalked us all our lives, but I rather believe that time is a companion who goes with us on the journey, reminds us to cherish every moment because they'll never come again.
What we leave behind is not as important as how we've lived.
After all, Number One, we're only mortal.
Speak for yourself, sir.
I plan to live forever.
I always thought
I'd get a shot at this chair one day.
Perhaps you still will.
Somehow, I doubt that this will be the last ship to carry the name Enterprise.
Picard to Farragut. Two to beam up.
- Honey... did you hear that?
- Hear what?
Barbara?
Did you hear that? I could have sworn I heard whispering.
You're reading my mind, that's all.
My thoughts sound like whispers.
Yeah? What were you thinking?
I love you, Doc.
You sure make it fun to wake up before dawn, I'll tell you that.
Frank?
- Did you finish last night?
- No.
Honey, it's a quarter to 6:00.
It's important.
Okay.
Thanks.
Okay.
That's everything.
Helium for the balloons!
I'm picking up a tank at Harold's right after I drop you off... per your instructions.
Did I think of that? Cool.
I must be starting to get this delegating authority stuff.
Well, Mrs. Magoo, I guess that's why they made you principal.
I guess so.
- Honey, don't smoke.
- Come on! You're going to make me crash.
I'll quit smoking when you decide to get pregnant, all right?
Guys!
- Hi!
- Hi.
- Be careful.
- Here I come.
Watch your step.
You all right?
Jill!
- Who's the chef?
- Oliver.
Great, I love burnt hot dogs.
Thanks. So when's Ben coming home?
Six weeks, four days and nine hours.
- Okay, watch the edges. Don't spill it.
- I got it.
Let's take it over here.
- Callie, how are you?
- Frank. Good. Good to see you.
Where's my helium?
- Say you love me, baby.
- Not until you get me my helium.
Righty-o. I'll get right on it, dear.
- You go here.
- Okay.
There's Jill. I've got those receipts here.
- How you doing?
- How the hell are you?
- All right, bye.
- Bye. See you later.
- Barbara!
- Frank!
Good morning, Sam.
And you must be Cindy.
It's nice to finally meet you.
Do you want to take a look around?
You'll really love this place.
- Harold.
- Morning, Doc.
- Frank.
- Doc, how the hell are you?
Heading over to the school fair?
I have to go to Butler County and make my rounds at the hospital.
You've got to try this muscle machine I made.
Show everybody how strong you are.
I don't know.
I should probably sit in the shade and watch you young guys do it.
- See you, tough guy.
- Right.
Okay. Thanks, Jill.
We need finger paints.
Okay. I'll get them.
Just put it on the table.
Finger paints. Okay.
Yikes.
Well, a civilian pilot spots the smoke.
Then I get here and find two of my officers passed out like babies.
Everything on that side of the white line is out cold.
So somebody starts talking about chemical weapons... and somebody hits a panic button, and then you people are calling.
- There you go.
- Look, there is no research lab.
There is no chemical plant.
There is no toxic waste dump.
There is no nuclear plant!
- There's no nothing around here.
- Okay.
Nothing on the news channels or news services. Nobody's got it yet.
Good.
I'm just going to take myself in there and get a look-see.
Ed.
- That's Frank McGowan's truck, right?
- What's left of it.
- Lucky you weren't in town today, Doc.
- What's going on here?
Nobody knows anything, not even that fed doctor down there.
She brought this whole circus with her, and they don't have a clue.
Go on out there and see what the hell's going on. Be careful.
- Stay here?
- Yeah, we're just waiting.
All right, good.
Pull him back!
Get him out of there! Let's go!
Get him down!
- Stay back!
- Excuse me.
Hits him like a hammer.
That's all we know.
- Some kind of chemical gas?
- No, it can't be.
The edges of the affected area are well-defined.
Stationary.
- Doc, this is Dr. Susan...
- Vurner. Like Turner, with a "V."
Epidemiologist,
National Science Foundation.
- Alan Chaffee.
- MD?
He's breathing. Good pulse.
I think he just fainted.
Is Midwich affected by this?
- My hunch would be, yes.
- My wife's in Midwich.
We tried calling for the last six hours.
Nobody picks up or calls out.
Could somebody please get me some blood and urine samples?
- What's the call?
You going? Okay, all right.
Just take it easy.
Somebody get him a blanket.
What happened?
Barbara?
Thank God. Are you all right?
Sweetheart, are you okay?
- I'm cold.
- All right, come on. Let's go home.
No.
Heavenly Father... we mourn these lives cut short... without warning or apparent purpose.
We search for a reason and find none.
We have become accustomed to the power of science... so when we were struck down, we turned to science and asked, "Why?"
But it could not answer.
So now we turn our eyes toward Heaven... and seek our comfort in God's infinite mercy.
Let us pray.
"Our Father, who art in Heaven...
"...hallowed be Thy name...
"...Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done...
"...on Earth as it is in Heaven.
"Give us this day our daily bread...
"...and forgive us our trespasses...
"...as we forgive those who trespass against us...
"...and lead us not into temptation...
"...but deliver us from evil.
"For Thine is the kingdom, and the power...
"...and the glory, forever and ever.
"Amen."
Did you ever hear of Charles Fort?
He wrote The Book of the Damned, about unexplainable things.
Like frogs falling from the sky, blue snow, red rain...
Are you suggesting I read him?
No. It's just that...
Sometimes mysteries don't get solved.
I mean, what if something like this happens again?
I don't know. What do I do?
Can I call you?
Well, of course, you can call me.
By the way, I suggest you read Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.
Sherlock Holmes once said:
"When you've eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable...
"...must be the truth." it's not possible.
You made a mistake. Do it again.
Well, I don't have a problem running the tests again...
I have felt like this before in the morning.
It is just some kind of bug.
Melanie?
What's the matter?
- Maybe I can help.
- No.
You can't.
- There they are!
- Hey, guys!
We're empty! We need some more here!
Hi, how are you?
It's good to see you.
Hi.
Ben, this is fantastic.
Callie, look up and smile.
Ben, after a year in Japan... did you ever think you'd have to get used to being a dad?
Hello, Doc.
I said, "Hello."
- How long have you been standing there?
- Ages.
Liar.
Big boy.
Why are you kissing me like that?
I wanted to know first, so I used a home pregnancy kit.
Honey, you know those are unreliable.
And that's why I went to see
Dr. Cornright just to make sure.
Are you going to open it?
Alan?
Hi. You got a minute?
Sure.
Everything's positive.
You are pregnant.
We'd been trying, you know.
Look.
I wanted to tell you something before you hear it from somebody else.
There are a lot of pregnancies.
I mean, a lot.
Much more than would normally be expected.
What do you mean?
Is something wrong with my baby?
No, it's nothing to indicate that.
You're a normal, healthy young woman...
Alan, don't talk to me like a doctor.
Okay.
All the pregnancies seem to date from the day of the blackout.
No!
Dr. Susan Vurner has flown in...
This is all because of that blackout, isn't it?
- Just come out and say something!
- They don't know for sure!
They are all going to be deformed!
Wait a minute. That's not true!
Excuse me! That's not true.
There's no reason to believe that.
Barbara and I are pregnant.
We know how you feel.
We know what you are thinking, so let me say right now... the same thing I've told a lot of you individually.
The standard tests have not revealed one abnormality.
Anywhere. Not one. All right?
Let's listen to Dr. Vurner, please.
She's come to talk to us.
Dr. Susan Vurner, ladies and gentlemen.
I want to start off by saying we are all very concerned about your well-being.
But ultimately it will come down to individual decisions.
And I understand that these decisions will be probably the most intimate... personal, difficult decisions that you ever make in your life.
However, because your pregnancies have attracted intense scientific interest... including the National institutes of
Health and National Science Foundation... those of you who decide to have your child... will have all prenatal expenses paid.
You'll also receive $3,000 monthly as an allowance.
If you allow your child to be examined and tested on some sort of regular basis.
Is that $3,000 a family?
What if your wife and your daughter both have kids?
Then you would receive $6,000.
I don't want you to interpret this allowance as some sort of a pressure.
It isn't. It's your decision.
If you decide to terminate then, of course, you have the right to do that.
You can do it privately.
Or if financially unable, a medical team will be brought in next week.
- The choice is yours.
- That's killing babies.
Are you okay?
Ben's moving out.
He won't believe me.
What are you going to do?
I can't keep it.
I mean, it can't be Ben's.
I just don't...
I just don't understand.
Something very strange is happening to all of us, Callie.
You know, they say... the Roberts' girl is a virgin.
What are you going to do?
I don't know.
I don't know.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
It was just a dream.
Okay.
Let's go back to sleep.
What's going on, doctor?
Nothing.
They have apparently decided to keep their babies.
All of them?
Why?
That's a very good question.
Keep pushing! Push!
Okay, here we go. Here we go. Almost.
Almost done! Good, Mom. That's good.
Push, push, push.
That's it. That's it.
You're doing great!
Take a deep breath.
Deep breath and push!
Push, push, push!
Come with that. Push a little more.
- Push, Barbara, push.
- A little more. A little more.
Push. Push.
Help me!
We've got a problem!
ICU, now!
- Push, push, push!
- Come on!
- There we go!
- Good, Barbara!
And there we go.
Beauty! Looking great, sweetie.
Good job.
It's a girl, honey.
She's fine.
- There we are. Clamp this.
- Look, here's your baby.
He's beautiful.
Ben.
Come on, just breathe once. Oxygen.
- Watch the BP.
- Just relax. You're hyperventilating.
Push. Doctor, get your ass over here and help me!
Bear down on her! Push!
All right, here we go! Come on, push!
Give me one big push!
Come on, here we go! Come on!
I'm sorry. It's stillborn.
Get some fluid in her.
How we doing? Everything all right?
We lost the Roberts' baby.
- God. How?
- Respiratory failure.
Umbilical asphyxia.
Where did you take the baby?
I saw you take Melanie's baby outside.
I took the baby for an autopsy.
I didn't want the other mothers to see.
I baptize thee... in the name of the Father... and the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen.
I got you.
Yes.
Let us pray.
Heavenly Father, we thank you that by the water of the Holy Spirit... you have bestowed upon your servants, the forgiveness of sin... and have raised them to the new life of grace.
"Sustain them, O Lord, in your Holy Spirit.
"Give them an inquiring and discerning heart...
"...the courage to will and to persevere...
"...the spirit to know and to love you...
"...and the gift of wonder and joy in all your work. Amen."
Amen.
Good girl.
That's a good girl.
Note how the section of hair is flat on one side then arced on the other...
- ...like a capital "D."
- Right.
The texture is... I don't know.
It's unusually soft.
What did you think when you looked at her nails?
Narrower than normal.
Any results yet from the DNA testing?
Common genetic characteristics.
Almost as if they are siblings from the same parent.
It's way too early to have anything conclusive.
Baby.
What are you doing?
You can spell your name.
How can you spell your name?
How can Mommy's... smart little boy spell his name?
Sweetie, was the soup too hot?
Okay, baby.
We're going to go see our friend Mara.
Barbara?
Are you crazy?
Honey, can't you tell me what happened?
Don't!
No! God, no!
I understand there are recent developments at Midwich.
Yes.
The children are beginning to interact more with the general community.
There have been casualties...
I should say accidents, suicides... that might be related to contact with the children.
But no direct physical violence was involved.
I have also been trying unsuccessfully to get Dr. Chaffee back on the program.
His daughter's the leader, isn't she?
He's probably got his hands full.
Personal considerations aren't important, are they?
I think that the opportunity to study these children should take precedent... over any considerations.
Let's cut to the chase here.
It's now of interest to national security that we continue... to carefully monitor their developing powers.
I ask for another year's grant.
Good afternoon, children.
Why do you smile?
You're trying to hide your thoughts from us.
Just how deeply do you see?
Everything active in your mind.
But the process that leads to the spoken words eludes us.
Why do you speak some thoughts and not others?
Wouldn't it be a noisy world if we said everything we thought?
Okay, I'm going to put a drop of this in your eyes; it won't hurt.
I'm sorry. Calm down!
I'm going to wash your eye out!
Okay, open your eyes! It's all right!
It's okay!
How's the doctor?
Corneal scarring.
Most likely permanent blindness.
How did it happen?
Doesn't remember much.
It will be listed as an accident.
It was the children.
There's no proof of that.
What I want to know is... are the people in this town safe?
- What are they going to do to us?
- Alan.
- Hi.
- This has got to stop.
They don't belong in regular classes.
It's getting dangerous, the other children can't learn.
I was thinking maybe you could teach them.
They seem to respect you.
Respect?
No. They don't even know the meaning of that word.
Why bother? It doesn't make any difference what we do.
We need you.
What am I going to teach them?
What am I possibly going to teach them?
Humanity.
Humanity.
Hello, sweetheart.
Come on.
There's no need for you to become emotional.
I'm old enough to do things by myself.
Do you want to talk about what happened at the clinic today?
Why should I be experiencing emotion at this moment?
What is that word you're thinking?
What is "empathy"?
So if I have felt pain...
I should be able to identify with others who feel pain.
Yes.
Good night.
What's the matter?
You want some?
I'm sorry.
I just can't hack it.
"God said...
"...Let us make man in our image...
"...after our likeness."
But "image" does not mean outer image... or every statue or photograph would be man.
It means the inner image.
The spirit, the soul.
So we gather here today... to remember the inner beauty... of one who lost her hold.
Melanie Roberts... somehow lost that image of herself as a creature... made in God's bountiful spirit.
But what of those in our midst... who do not have individual souls... or spirits?
They have one mind... that they share between them.
One spirit.
And they have the look of man.
But not the nature of mankind.
What are you doing here?
Looking for the baby.
The one who was born with us.
The one who died.
How do you know about that?
The baby's not here.
She was taken away.
Where?
I don't know.
Do you have a memory of the baby?
But it bothers you.
It hurts to lose a loved one.
She was to be with me.
We were to be together.
How do you know that?
You've lost someone too.
I think I can teach them.
Anyway, I'll try.
I never told David about the Roberts' baby.
Right.
And then he said,
"she was to be with me"?
What did that mean?
I don't know.
Are they paired up... like a mate?
What can I teach such bright young students?
What about human physiology?
That's at least something
I know a little bit about.
For example, does anybody here know how the eye works?
Do you mean how do we see, or...
Well, what else can the eye do?
- The eyes are...
- The eyes are the windows of the soul.
Yes.
That's right. I see that you've been reading proverbs.
I was speaking to Robert.
The eyes are the windows of the soul.
All right, if you'd rather talk about philosophy instead of...
- ...physiology, let's talk about the soul.
- Alan.
Sorry.
Can you come to my office for a minute, please?
Yes. I'll be right there.
While I'm away, why don't you each take out a volume of the encyclopedia... and try to learn a little something about our culture.
I know your game.
I know what you're up to.
Ever since you got here,
I've been watching.
Watching people leave this town.
Watching things die.
You aren't right. None of you.
And one of these days, somebody's going to do something about it.
I don't like the way you're looking at me, boy.
I got a gun, too, and I'm not the only one.
One day somebody's going to get up on a rooftop... and start picking you little bastards off.
One by one by one.
Aren't you going to do something?
Aren't you going to bawl like all the other little pissants?
Well, do something, damn it!
There are going to be changes.
God help us.
The children did it.
I know they did it.
And my daughter was involved.
Now, who are they?
It was their communal consciousness...
Some abrupt evolutionary jump.
It was their communal consciousness... but I couldn't explain the blackout.
Or the mass pregnancies.
Midwich isn't the only colony of such children.
In a township in northern Australia,
30 infants were born in a single day.
They all died within ten hours of birth.
In an Inuit community near Anchorage, a group of 10 children were born.
There were 20 births in a small village near the Turkish-Iranian border.
Each location was remote... isolated, and each had a blackout the same as Midwich.
And how long have you known about this?
The way I see it, there are three possibilities.
Number one: parthenogenesis.
The development of a fetus without fertilization.
I know. I don't buy that, either.
Two: we do know the CIA slipped doses of LSD to men without them knowing it... in order to study the effects of psychotropes on gene structure.
Maybe the government engineered the blackout... then artificially inseminated your women with super sperm.
First they knocked them out, then they knocked them up.
And what's the third possibility?
Xenogenesis. Implantation.
The production of an offspring unlike that of the parent.
Or should I say host?
Come back to the project.
Not just a matter of protecting your daughter. As you can see, it goes... far, far beyond that.
You have to put this in the back of your mind.
Don't think about it when near them.
- Don't ever let them know that you know.
- Why didn't you tell us?
- I mean, why didn't you warn us?
- Because I couldn't.
Well, I couldn't.
If anybody else knew, the children would know.
Look, I have spent years of my life building a wall around this.
Hiding it, so they couldn't read what was in my mind.
But as their powers grow stronger, they keep looking deeper and deeper.
I need your help.
Would you please just... come back to the project.
We've made our decision.
Discussion will not change our plans.
We will live in the abandoned barn outside of town.
You will bring us supplies.
You can't stop us, you know.
Don't try.
You've been discussing us with Dr. Vurner.
What did she tell you?
You are hiding something.
I'm not letting you go.
- You haven't been given an option.
- Have you?
You know, you don't always have to do everything they tell you.
We are the same.
You're not.
You're David. You're different.
I've come to get Julie.
Have you seen her?
Is she at the barn?
Fine.
Are you all right?
I'm sorry.
You're okay, aren't you?
Julie doesn't want to come with you.
Damn it, I don't care what Julie wants.
Her mother's frantic.
I'm bringing her home.
Some kind of big accident,
Doc, out by the barn.
Alan, wait!
I was just told that the other towns with blackout children were destroyed.
- What? All of them?
- Everyone in them, the adults and children.
They couldn't evacuate without the children knowing.
- The governments gave no warning.
- God. What about Midwich?
I've been told to pack and get out.
I'm leaving tonight. Do the same.
Get out while you can.
Another man is dead.
Why do you hate us so much, Mara?
It isn't a matter of hate.
It is a biological obligation.
You are thinking of what happened to the others.
Then our actions shouldn't surprise you.
We have to survive no matter what the cost.
We are the only ones left now.
I don't see why we can't reach an understanding.
Why can't we just live together?
If we coexist, we shall dominate you.
That is inevitable.
Eventually you will try to eliminate us.
We are all creatures of the life-force.
Now it has set us at one another to see who will survive.
- That's a cruel sport.
- Life is cruelty.
We all feed on each other, exploit each other in some way to survive.
I don't agree with you.
I think that adaptation is the key to survival.
Cooperation and symbiosis... and compassion.
Why do you think your own survival depends upon emotion from us?
Should we pity you?
- Empathize with your plight?
- You should feel!
You should feel something!
Without feelings, you're nothing.
You're just second-rate mimics of a higher organism.
That's right, a higher organism.
We're your superiors in our capacity to love.
Without compassion, you're a doomed species.
Emotion is irrelevant.
It is not our nature.
I'm not so sure you're right about that.
Still, you are aware of the other colonies.
So you must be, in some basic sense... aware of who... what we are.
Yes.
So the question becomes... should you be allowed to live?
You're suddenly thinking of an ocean.
You're blocking your thoughts rather effectively with this image.
We must leave here, spread out, disperse.
Soon we will have reached a stage where we can form new colonies.
You will arrange a method of getting us away from here.
What if I refuse you?
You are a prisoner of your values... and you won't be able to deceive us.
You know that.
Don't you?
Father?
Yes.
Yes, I know that.
Make your arrangements.
We must leave tonight.
You're thinking of the one who died.
She was to be my partner.
Yes, it's true.
Without a mate, you are of less importance to us.
And your development of emotions is disturbing.
We can't leave you behind.
It is time we resolved this.
Hurry up!
"Begone, everyone who is proud, and bring him low...
"...and tread down the wicked where they stand!"
- This is the last of it.
- All right, get going.
"Bind their faces in the world below.
"Then will I also acknowledge to you...
"...that your own right hand can give you victory!"
I'm glad you're here.
I wanted to talk to you.
I really think that I can help you.
You've got to stop! Please stop!
You got to stop! Sarah, please!
"Hast thou eyes of flesh?
"Dost thou see as man sees?"
A state of emergency has been declared.
Please return to your homes... and remain there until further notice.
- Come here! Grab my hand, quick!
- Come on!
People will be arrested.
This is a state of emergency.
Please be home.
The children murdered Sarah.
Susan too. I just found her at the clinic.
The police are on their way to the barn.
They're going after the children.
We've got to stop them.
- You can't go. You'll get hurt.
- We've got to try!
No. The state police can't do anything to stop the children. It'll be a bloodbath.
Now, listen to me. Listen to me.
There's another way.
Now, look, something happened today.
I was able to block Mara from reading my thoughts.
- How?
- I suddenly thought of the ocean.
I suddenly saw the view in front of our house.
You know how Barbara and I used to dream our dreams there?
We used to stand on the cliff and... right in front of us was something so much more powerful than we'll ever be.
That image came to me. That image came to me, and they couldn't see past it.
I know I can do that again.
I can build a wall.
I can build a wall and deceive them.
What are you going to do?
The only thing that we can do.
No.
Not David!
He's not one of them! No!
Multiple suspects. Possible 417.
All units respond and echo your 10-4.
41-A.
41-A, do you copy?
Echo, 41-A. Do you copy?
We're in position. Send them in.
Roger, this is 2-A. I copy.
241 in progress. Stand by.
What are you waiting for?
You got your orders.
Get out!
- More death.
- Survival.
Tell us what arrangements you have made for us.
Well, I haven't had much time.
It is 11:22.
What are you anxious about?
The arrangements.
Yes. Actually, I...
I left my notebook out in the car.
I wonder if somebody could go out and... get my notebook from the front seat of my car.
No.
I am unable to see what you're thinking.
Well, I'm... just wondering who's going to go out and get the notebook from my car.
- David.
- No.
You are successfully blocking your thoughts.
You are thinking... of a brick wall.
Why do you keep looking at the clock?
Come on.
- We're going now.
- Mother, no.
Take your place.
Stop it! Leave her alone!
Take him!
Go now! Go!
Don't worry.
We'll go someplace where nobody knows who we are.

Hey, George.
Born in poverty
You gonna just stand there or you gonna help me with these boxes?
Now what have you got me carryin', huh?
Got a deal on solar panels and batteries.
Well, I told you I wasn't doin' any more improvements on the house.
- I'm sellin' this place someday.
- Yeah, right.
But I see you improved the garden anyway.
- Yeah. And that goddamn rabbit still got in there.
- [ Chuckles ]
I told you. He went under your fence, George.
- He did not.
- He did too.
I put that fence a foot and a half underneath the ground.
Well, it's a mystery, George.
Anyway, this solar outfit, it's going to save you money, and it's free.
So happy birthday.
Thanks, Nate.
Thank you.
- [ Laughing ]
- [ Sighs ]
- Who's gonna put it together? Huh?
- Not me.
It comes with a manual in three different languages.
Forget it. Look, if it's a car, I can fix it.
If it's in the garden,
I probably can grow it. But--
This is way out of my neighborhood.
Hey, you, uh--
You bringin' a date tonight?
No. You?
- Well, I'm thinkin' of askin' somebody.
- When?
Today? You don't give 'em much notice, do you?
Well, you even ask anybody? Huh?
- I always ask Diana Ross, but she never says yes to me.
- [ Radio: The Supremes ]
- See you.
- See you later.
[ The Supremes ]
That you never ever gonna return
To ease the fire that within me burns
It keeps me cryin' baby, for you
Keeps me sighin' baby, for you
So won't you hurry
- Come on, boy
See about me
- [ Truck Horn Honks ]
- Come see about me
- [ George ] Hey, Bill!
See about your baby
Come see about me
Hey, George, George.
I forgot to tell you, man.
- Te llamo el doctor.
- Ah, ah, hold on. Hold on.
- Te llamo el doctor.
- Doctor called.
[ Exhales ] Banes, will you let me figure it out?
Dice que a las diez.
At ten, at 10:00.
At 10:00.
Que-- Que dijo?
Que dijo? He want you que vayas a su ventana at 10:00.
Que vayas a su ventana.
- Ventana. Ventana. Ventana.
- Ventana.
- He wants you to look at his window.
- Man!
How you doin', Lace?
You look great.
Yeah. How are the chairs sellin'?
I got one left.
I need four more.
Wow. It's going a lot better than I expected.
- Yeah? Well, you know, people sit down a lot around here.
- Yeah.
- Here. I can get these.
- No, I got it. Thanks.
Well, I'll help you.
Hey, uh, Lace. There's a-- There's a party tonight at the Elkhorn Bar.
Why do they call it that?
There's no elk around here.
I don't know. They just always called it the Elkhorn.
Why? They got some poor elk's horn hangin' over the bar?
[ Laughs ]
I don't think so.
Anyway, it's my birthday today, and there's a party tonight at the Elkhorn.
- I said that, didn't I?
- Yup.
- George!
- Oh. I gotta look up here at 10:00.
- Why?
- Well, that's Doc Brunder's office. Have you met him yet?
- No. What does he want?
- I don't know.
So, uh, hey, uh-- Do you-- Do you think you could come to the party?
No. I don't like to leave my kids home alone at night.
- Well, I know a good baby-sitter. Tito's wife.
- I live really far out.
- You know Tito. Tito? Tito!
- Really.
[ Lace ]
Hey, George.
- Hey. That's nice.
- Mmm.
- [ Tito, Banes Laughing ]
- [ Chuckling ] Oh, God.
- So that's the doctor?
- Yeah. That's the doctor.
Would you please come tonight?
No. Not tonight.
- Is it me?
- No. It's not you.
Well. Then I'll keep askin'.
[ Engine Cranking, Sputtering ]
Man, how I'd love to get my hands on your carburetor.
- [ Engine Starts ]
- I bet you would.

I need you
Oh, how I need you
- Hey, Nate. Nate!
- But all you do is treat me bad
- It's a scandal, you and Diana Ross.
- [ Chuckles ]
- I told the press. Yup.
- Oh, man.
- She'd be so happy on my farm.
- Mmm.
- No stress. No media, no press.
- Aw, it's true.
- Nothin'.
- Just-- Just heaven.
- Hey, you're not supposed to be buyin' drinks tonight.
- Wait.
- [ Nate ] Jimmy!
- Yo! George doesn't buy drinks tonight. It's his birthday.
- Doc! Hey, you made it.
- For you.
- [ Woman ] Hey, hi!
- How's everybody?
- Hey.
- Still breathing in and out?
[ Chuckles ]
- Doc, you gotta try--
You gotta try that cake.
- What?
- Tito's wife made it.
It is macho bueno.
- Macho!
- Oh, Doc. Thank you.
- [ Man ] Hey, Jimmy!
- You're welcome.
- Yeah.
You're learning the moves,
George, but you've never played amidst turmoil and confusion.
I wish we could go back to checkers. Maybe I could win.
No, no, no, no.
You have potential, George.
I always said George Malley has something extra to offer this world.
- I said that the day I, uh, circumcised you.
- [ Tito Laughs ]
- He says that every birthday!
- It was a bad joke, I know.
- [ Chuckles ]
- You know, you ruined my chance of romance today...
- with that obscene stunt in the window.
- It was an outrage!
- A criminal act.
- It was a disgrace!
Okay, there was a beautiful girl who walked right away from me.
- It was so embarrassing.
- George, you talking about the one with the chairs?
- Yeah.
- They-- They are not all that comfortable.
Well, I think they're perfect, but you gotta learn how to sit in 'em.
Ah, here you go. On the house, everybody. Happy birthday.
Oh, Jimmy, Jimmy.
There's no smoking section in heaven.
Aw, don't start, Doc. Don't start.
Pass those out. Pass 'em out.
Georgie. George.
Happy cumpleanos, amigo.
- Hey, amigo.
- [ Everyone ]
Good luck. Happy birthday.
- You all set?
- Yeah.
This is great.
This is great.
[ George ] Tito!
Wait, wait, wait. Tito!
Thanks for comin' to my party, man.
[ Laughing ]
- [ Tito ] Happy birthday, kid.
- Yeah. Happy birthday.
[ Sighs ]
Yup. Happy birthday.
Ah.
Thirty-seven.
Thirty-seven.
[ Zapping ]
Anybody see that?
There was th-that light?
- What kind of light?
- Y-You know, there was a noise.
- D-Did you hear it?
- No.
[ Doc ] Could we finish the game, George?
Man. I-I-It was like-- like-- like an explosion.
- A-A-And-- And it was a flash--
- Like a plane?
- A-A-And-- And it was a flash--
- Like a plane?
No. It was bigger than that.
I-I-It was farther away.
Oh, you mean like a star, George?
Man, it knocked me off my feet.
- [ Doc ] You fell?
- Yeah, I fell! I was hit right--
- [ Laughing ] The man's inebriated.
- I warned you.
- I'm not drunk, Nate.
- I'm takin' your queen,
George. Now pay attention.
Isn't that checkmate?
That's checkmate, isn't it?
You mean he beat you?
- You let him win, Doc?
Birthday present?
- I-I didn't let him win anything.
You're a little pissed off about that, aren't you?
- Play another one?
- You can get your revenge on me tomorrow, all right?
- You feeling okay?
- Yep.
- Can you drive, George?
- Yeah. I'm all right.
Hey. Thanks, everybody.
- Happy birthday, buddy.
- Happy birthday, George.
That was a good party.

- That's it!
- [ Attila Barks ]
[ Phone Dialing ]
[ Phone Ringing ]
- What?
- I figured it out.
Jesus, George! What are you doing calling me? It's late.
I thought that farmers got up when it was still dark.
That's if you have cows.
I don't have any cows, George.
- Now, look. There's only one explanation for that rabbit.
- What!
You see, when I built that fence higher and deeper, he was already in there.
See? He was hiding.
I fenced him in! [ Laughs ]
- There's only one thing
I can do now, just let him out.
- Good night, George.
Good night.
[ Exhales ]
[ Chuckles ]
Here's Roger.
George, can I have my Bronco back?
I don't have any cash right now, but I need my car.
Well, I need some solar panels installed on my roof.
I don't know anything about solar.
Well, Charlie Shipper does. And, uh--
He needs a well dug on his property.
You help him dig the well, he'll help me with the panels, and I'll fix your car.
- Deal?
- Yeah, deal!
I'll, uh--
I'll call Charlie.
Hi. I just called about, uh, fixin' my brakes.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Be right with you. Uh, Tito.
Atiende el senor.
Estoy ocupado con algo... uh... con este despues.
- Come on.
- Tito. He speaks Spanish better than I do now.
Yeah. Better than me too.
- [ Truck Horn Honking ]
- [ Kid Imitating Engine Sounds ]
Right. Where is the owner and operator of this vehicle?
- You a cop?
- Our mom's in the store.
Mm-hmm. You got the brake on, sport?
- His name's Al.
- What's your name?
Glory.
Well, I'm George.
Pop the hood, Al.
Why?
- You know how to start this thing?
- Duh.
- [ Engine Starts ]
- Ah.
Emergency road service, ma'am.
- Truck can't breathe, and your idle's too fast.
- Mm, sorry. Gotta go.
Where? You're not, uh, leavin' town, are you?
No. Just San Francisco for the day.
Oh, I used to live there. Ask--
Ask me directions on where you're going.
As a matter of fact, ask me anything at all. You could even ask me to come along.
I'd show you the sights, the hazards.
What do you think?
I think your idle's too fast.
San Francisco, huh?
- But you were born here, right?
- How'd you know I was born here?
Just now, in the store. Someone said,
'I've known George Malley all my life.
And if he said he saw a UFO, he saw one.'
I didn't say that.
- [ Al ] You saw one?
- But I didn't say what I saw.
- [ Glory ] What'd it look like?
- Well, it could've been!
That's mate, Doc.
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
George!
What in the hell is goin' on here? What?
Look, you know, I don't know, Doc.
I-I-I really don't know.
It's just lately I've been-- been seeing things so clearly, you know. l, uh-- You know,
I understand right away.
I concentrate. And, uh--
And books. I can't stop feeding myself.
I-I read two-- two, three books a day. Imagine that.
And-- And-- You know, I can't stop, and I-I-I can't sleep.
You know, ever since the, uh--
I-I-I gotta go.
Get back to work.
[ Jimmy, Roger ]
Ever since... the sighting.
[ Laughs ]
Roger, it was a damn light!
- And a boom.
- Now, did you hear it?
Well, no.
Anybody?
About nine days ago, right outside here?
Was that 12:00, George?
George, come in for a physical. Okay?
George.
- Two or three books a day?
- At least.
- About what?
- About everything.
You know, all the things
I've wanted to know about and learn.
Like what?
[ Chuckles ]
Well, you tell me, Rog.
I mean, what have you always wanted to know about and learn?
Hmm?
Think about it.
I'm waiting for ignition
I'm looking for a spark
Any chance collision and I light up in the dark
Such a nice emotion
Do not know where it goes
I'm equipped for movement
And I have the touch
Any social occasion it's 'Hello, how do you do'
All those introductions
I never miss my cue
So before a question
So before a doubt
My hand moves out and
- I have the touch
- [ Barks ]
Only, only
Wanting contact
With you
Shake those hands
Shake those hands
Shake hands
- [ Laughs ]
- [ Doc Reading Aloud ]
- Shake hands
I have the touch
[ Nate ] CQ, this is WB6QLF, standing by.
Searcher out of Harmon, California.
Is anybody in the void tonight?
I'm lookin' for Diana Ross,
- but I'll accept any voice in the English tongue.
- [ Crash ]
- [ George Muttering ]
- Is that you, Diana?
- Hey, George.
- Now, look, Nate.
You haven't sat 'til you've put your ass on one of these homemade willow chairs. Okay?
Now, I brought you a pair so you can put your feet up, or if you, uh, want a friend to sit in there, if you decide one day and invite someone over.
What do you think?
I don't think they go, George.
Oh, what would you know?
Looks like a swap meet blew in here.
Talk about needin' a woman's touch.
This is an emergency.
Hey, Nate. I've been workin' on that solar kit you gave me.
I am telling you, the whole field of photovoltaics is-- is just in baby land!
I mean-- You know--
The-- The idea that plants have been storing and-- and using the sun's energy since the birth of the world!
I mean, photosynthesis is-- is a model for us, and we're just scratching the surface... of what we could do with these silicon cells.
I'm telling you.
[ Sighs ] What?
What?
You just talk so fast, George.
And-- And you know so much stuff.
I'm sorry. But--
I can't help it, Nate.
- That's okay.
- Mmm.
- [ High-Pitched Radio Beeps ]
- What is that?
Uh, it's just computers talking to computers.
- Shh. Leave it, leave it, leave it.
- Aw, come on.
- The Morse code's goin' too fast for you to pick that out.
- No, no, no. It's--
- I can hear it.
- Bull.
No. I'll tell you what it is. A repeated pattern.
They're looping a message.
[ Nate ]
'Watering the golds... Friday.'
Yeah. Yeah. Now, who'd be sending a coded message like that in simple Morse?
Oh, man, look. I pick up, like two different air force bases.
I think we better leave this one alone, George.
- Mm. No, no, this is a different one. Listen, listen!
- [ Beeps Continue ]
This one's much denser, but i-it's still a loop.
It still repeats.
Listen.
- Seriously, I think--
- Oh, I gotta record this.
- We ought to leave this alone.
- Where's your-- No, no, no, no.
What are you doin'?
Well, I'm gonna take it home so I can break it down. Then we can answer it.
- Why?
- Because it gives me something to do, Nate.
[ Sighs ] I don't know if it's gettin' worse or it's gettin' better.
But, you know, I have 12 hours in the night to kill. And I--
When I get tired of reading,
I do crossword puzzles, but they're all too simple.
- [ Laughs ] Too simple.
- [ Chuckles ]
And then everybody I know is asleep, and I'm-- I'm awake at night.
Is there something-- something I could do?
Hey! Why don't we just go outside and box?
I could split your lip again. You'll--
Yeah, you'll feel a lot better.
No.
Hey, if you sent a message, would they get it?
- Yeah, sure. Uh--
- Send this.
Send them, 'Don't, uh--
Don't overwater the golds.' Say that.
- Okay, fine. The golds?
- Marigolds.
- Oh, yeah.
- No, no, no, no. Say, 'Don't overwater the marigolds Friday.'
- [ Beeping, Clicking ]
- Don't overwater... the marigolds on Friday.
- Right.
- 'We'll be watching.'
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Watching.
Oh, God. This is cool.
[ Whines ]
[ Attila Barks, Growls ]
It's okay, Attila.
It's nothing.
Static electricity, that's all.
That's all it is.
[ Exhales ]
See? Here-- Here you go.
Okay!
[ Sighs ]
All right. Okay.
Oh, God!
Oh, God!
Oh, man!
Is somebody trying to tell me something?
Huh?
What?
[ Exhales ]
- Did you pee in the cup?
- Yup.
- You still having trouble sleeping?
- Yup. Any ideas?
How long have you been feeling this way?
Well, you know how long I've been feeling this way. Everybody does.
I mean, it's been over a month since my birthday.
Notice anything else? Or--
Yeah.
What?
Well, watch your fountain pen there.
What do you mean?
Ohh! Uh--
[ Chuckles ]
- That's telekinesis.
- Yeah.
Is that okay?
Do it again.
Do it again.
You know, uh, I consider myself a rational man.
A man of science. You know, open to... whatever. But, uh--
I feel like a child,
George. I feel scared.
Me too.
Well, whatever the reason is,
I promise you we'll find it. Okay?
[ Chuckles ] Now, let me see you do that one more time.
[ Engine Revving, Rattling ]
It's a monster, George.
Yup, yup. This old
Frankenstein here... gets 90 miles to the gallon on methane.
And it's made from my garbage...
[ Chuckles ] and Nate's pig manure-- special blend.
- Sure smells like it.
- [ Chuckles ]
[ Banes ]
See, Georgie?
- [ George ] Hello, Lace.
- Hey.
These are a little bit different. I used a little bit of a wider branch on these.
Yeah, they look great.
- George, are these yours?
- Yeah. Yeah. I've been, uh, workin' on some, uh, special organic fertilizers.
- Go ahead, taste it.
- Mmm.
No, no, no.
Bite into it like a-- like an apple.
- Oh!
- You got some on your chin. Sorry.
Maybe, uh-- Maybe the kids would like some.
- That's great. Thanks.
- No, no, no. Lace, wait.
Let me pick some out for you, okay?
If the kids like 'em, you know, y-y-you could make anything.
You could make some sauce or a soup.
George, I thought you were smart.
[ Tito ]
Hey, what's she got, anyway?
Yeah. Yeah, besides uncomfortable chairs.
My heart, amigos.
My heart. [ Sighs ]

Ouch!
These are the days when anything goes
Every day is a winding road
- I'm feelin' fine
- Are those for our mom?
Yup.
I thought flowers were for dates.
[ Laughs ]
Don't get spooky, Al.
Did she invite you?
Hey, wait a minute!
Blue. I don't have blue.
Every day is a winding road
- Every day is a winding road
- Oh, great.
Every day is a winding road
- You guys know the name of this, uh-- this flower?
- No.
- No.
- A Delphinium belladonna.
That's the Ranunculaceae family.
I didn't always know the names of flowers, but it seems, recently, that I can pretty much name any flower I see.
Yeah. Like this one is Lamonium sabbatom.
And, uh, this is the, uh--
[ Chuckles ]
Doesn't make 'em any prettier, though.
- Is that a garbage bag tie?
- Yeah.
I was improvising.
Hey, now that's a good idea.
- Ah, that's much better.
- Yup.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Every day is a winding road
Every day is a winding road
My mom's around back!
Every day is a winding road
Lace?
Hi.
- Hi.
- Now, you didn't nearly take enough tomatoes.
And I'm very proud of them.
Uh, well, there you go.
And, uh...
I got you these.
Uh, well, that's every wildflower from my house to your house.
Your kids helped.
- Thanks.
- Yeah.
- Hey, what are you working on?
- Nah, nothing. Nothing.
- Look at this. Wow. That's--
That's really great work.
- [ Kids Giggling ]
- Look at this. Beautiful.
- Uh, you want to, uh, walk?
- Sure.
- [ Glory ] Shh.
I-- I gotta tell you, you-- you got great kids.
Yeah, they are great kids.
But you don't really know that yet,
George, because you don't know them... and you don't know me.
- Well, I'm tryin' to get to know you.
- I know.
I-I really want to keep my life very simple.
Even predictable.
That's why I moved here.
I don't like surprises, and I don't like complications.
What happened to you, Lace?
- Oh, I'm sorry.
Th-That's none of my business.
- No, no. It's okay.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
So, let me ask you something, George.
When a man comes over with a basket full of tomatoes, what is he expecting?
- Dinner?
- No, no, no.
Just hoping.
Charlock folium.
Look at--
Uh, you don't have any purple in those flowers I got you, do you?
Whoa. Did you--
Did you feel that?
- Feel what?
- Uh... oh!
Uh--
Uh, uh, come here.
Come here. Let's see.
- Okay.
- Feel that, right there.
Feel what?
Oh, God. I think
I know what this is.
- What?
- C-C-Can I use your phone?
Yeah.
Okay. Yeah.
Just east of Harmon. Do you know which one I'm talking about?
No. I-I-I was told to call you, and-- and I'm telling you right now... that I picked up on some activity.
No, we didn't use any instrumentation.
No, I don't have a degree, and I haven't studied anywhere, but I'm just trying to--
Are you shutting me down here?
Is that what's going on?
Are you trying to shut me down?
Look, I'm just trying to tell you that
I felt the compression waves, okay?
ULF, ultralow frequency waves.
N-N-Now, they have the ability to make you nauseous and-- and dizzy. Am I right?
Okay. Well, that's what I felt.
And-- And I'm trying to tell you...
- th-that I think that there--
- [ Phone Disconnects ]
There's an earthquake coming.
Um, listen, Al. Why don't you put some masking tape on the cupboards?
- And, Glory, bring the vases down, and the china.
- Okay.
This is good, Lace.
- I think you're a good cook.
- No, I'm not.
I only make two things pretty well-- pork chops and, um, turkey.
Which is this?
[ Laughing ]
I'm-- I'm just--
- [ Dishes Rattling ]
- Look!
[ Gasps ]
Al!
- Oh, you!
- [ Laughing ] I was just joking.
- [ Lace ] Oh, please!
- [ Everyone Laughing ]
Oh, you scared me!
[ Exhales ]
- Not funny.
- [ Chuckling ]
[ Clears Throat ]
- Outside?
- Thanks.
- All right. Can I say it now?
- What's that?
- You've got great kids.
- Oh, thanks.
- And I thank you for dinner.
- You're welcome.
- And good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Yeah.
Shh. She's coming.
- Tell her.
- You tell her.
- Shh.
- [ Clears Throat ]
- He's neat.
- Yeah, he's nice, isn't he?
Yeah, but he thinks he saw a UFO, and he thinks he can predict earthquakes.
There may be a warning here.
But he never said for sure it was a UFO
[ Rumbling ]
Oh, Jesus!
Doorway, doorway!
Let's get in the truck.
Get in the truck!
- It's over, Mom.
- I know it's over. Let's go! Now!
- [ Attila Barking ]
- Did you feel it? Huh?
- Did you get scared? Huh?
- [ Whining ]
Do you realize the possibilities of this? Huh?
- [ Truck Approaching ]
- Do you know what this means?
You felt it, didn't you?
- You did!
- What is going on, George?
- Wasn't that amazing?
- Tell me what's happening.
I don't know!
I don't-- I don't know!
I need the simple truth, George.
This is the truth. Wh-Wh-What's happening to me i-is the truth.
Oh, no.
[ Exhales ]
Lace.
I love those chairs, Lace.
I love them.
I did--
Y-You made them.
Okay? All right?
I-I wanted to see you.
Okay?
Bring them back to your shop tomorrow.
- I'll give you your money back.
- I don't want my money back, Lace.
I just asked you for one thing, George. The truth.
And you couldn't handle it.
[ Nate ] George, haven't you called her yet?
Never mind about that now, will you?
Now, this is the second one.
- Gladiolus. Remember that.
- How do you know she's still mad at you?
- I know. Now. All right.
- Write her a note.
No, no. I found this.
Classic five-bed garden pattern.
Flowers. You should send her flowers or candy.
Yeah. Marigolds, gladiolas, roses, et cetera.
And I went to the library, and I looked up the missile silo pattern... at the Masterson Air Force Base.
I made my-- my own overlay.
And here we go.
- There.
- Yeah.
See, that's their-- that's their garden. You see?
Well, that's old stuff, and it's-- it's, uh, declassified. But now, this--
This stuff is trickier.
This is, uh, trigraphs and tetragraphs and ABBA class.
- George. [ Sighs ]
- Yep?
- Well, you just tell me what you want me to send.
- Right.
Okay, send this.
Why don't you send this?
'Mind your garden. Frost coming. Luck on the Mozop.'
- Wanna know what 'Mozop' is?
- That's okay. It's your game, George.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hey, you sat in this chair yet?
- It's nice.
- Yeah, yeah.
- You should give her a call right now.
- Nah. Let her cool off.
- [ Radio Beeping ]
- I figure I'll give her about a year.
- [ Chuckles ]
Pick up the phone and call her, George.
Look who's talkin'.
Diana Ross fan club.
Have you said ten words to a woman this year?
Ah, I'm sorry, Nate.
Your transmission's finished, sir.
I've just been goin' through some things lately.
Everybody's goin' through something.
I know, but, uh--
This thing's been hard for me to handle.
Let me show you something.
[ Exhales ]
You suppose they magnetized you?
I don't know, buddy.
I wish I did.
- [ Doc ] What've we got here?
- Hurry up! Get in there.
[ All Chattering ]
- [ Man ] Dor na barriga.
- One of you go to the garbage... and bring me any food containers you find.
- [ Muttering In Portuguese ]
- Somebody else go in the cabinets... and look for damaged or swollen cans.
- Food poisoning.
- I think.
- [ Muttering ]
- Now, what the hell is he saying? Who speaks Spanish?
[ Woman ] That's Portuguese.
They just came in last week.
- Portuguese?
- Berto, onde esta?
He's trying to tell us something about Berto.
- [ Groaning ]
- That's the little one.
It's a little boy.
All right, some of you search around here for the kid.
I'm gonna tell you right now he could be pretty darn sick.
Now, Bonnie, wait.
Uh--
Get on the phone and get
George Malley over here.
Tell him what's going on and tell him to stop at the library for a English-Portuguese book.
Tell him to find out how to ask where a lost boy is. Got that?
- George Malley?
- You bet. [ Chuckles ]
George. Go on, do it.
Just go on. Go on!
[ Phone Ringing ]
- Don't you answer that?
- Not when I'm working.
I been farmin' all my life,
- [ Ringing Continues ]
- but this growth is amazing, George.
[ Laughs ]
This is embarrassing.
You know, I want to try this fertilizer in your south 40.
You just sprayed my boots.
It's the worst soil in the county.
I can't even get weeds to grow in that field.
But I bet we can get corn to grow in that field.
You bet? You don't have any money to bet.
You spent all your money on chairs, remember?
[ Vehicle Approaching ]
[ Attila Barks ]
- George Malley?
- Yeah, I'm George Malley.
I-I'm John Ringold.
We talked on the phone the other day.
- John Ringold? From Berkeley?
- Yes. Yes.
- [ Laughs ] Right! Hi.
- Yeah.
- Hey, I'm glad you came by.
- Will your dog let me step out?
Oh, yeah, yeah. Well, he just has a thing for seismologists.
Now, come on out.
- Thank you.
- Yeah, this is my friend, Nate Pope.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
- L-Let me get you a cold drink. Come on in.
- From the university, huh?
- Yes.
- Uh-huh.
And, uh, we are very interested in how you were able to predict that earthquake, Mr.Malley.
Oh, that.
You see, I-I just picked up the subsonic frequency waves, right?
And, of course, I was standing on the fault, so that made it easier.
- What instrumentation did you use?
- Just me.
If you think that's something, you should see him move stuff with his brain.
Nate! Never mind that. You see,
I felt the ultralow frequency waves.
And they kind of made me dizzy and nauseous, right? And that's how I perceived all this.
We've been studying quake prediction for ten years.
There's no record of any person ever feeling the prequake activity.
Now there is.
We have some ULF equipment in our labs.
Could you come in for an experiment?
- Come to Berkeley?
- Yes.
[ Laughs ]
Yes.
Well, my department would like to interview you and clear this up.
I-I would be-- I would be so glad to come to Berkeley.
D-Do you think that I could meet with-- with some other departments as well?
I-I have some experiments that
I'd like to show you. Come with me.
They're nice.
All right.
Well, uh, let's see.
Um. Oh, oh, yes, here.
Okay, now, look, um--
I've taken solar panels, and I've actually germinated the seeds... th-that made these-- th-th-these plants grow.
I'm trying to change the electromagnetic field, right?
- Uh, Mr.Malley?
- I took, uh, incandescent light...
- Mr.Malley.
- and turned it into sunlight, which actually made these-- these plants grow.
- Mr.Malley.
- Oh. Now look,
I-I-I took pig manure... and I turned it into a fuel, which I-I believe will actually run an automobile.
All I'm interested in is the earthquake.
We need to know if that was a fluke.
A coincidence.
A fluke?
George, why don't you move something with your mind?
Maybe move his, uh-- [ Mouthing Word ] or something like that?
- Look, Mr.Ringold.
- Doctor.
D-Dr.Ringold, uh, look--
I--
Look. I-- I've got-- I've got my garden out there, and that acts like a lab, right?
- And I've got-- And I've got everything that you see here.
- [ Vehicle Approaching ]
- But I-- I really need to talk to people like you, okay?
- [ Tito ] Hey, George!
- [ Horn Honking ]
- [ Shouting ] George! Are you home?
- Please don't go, okay?
Just please don't go.
- George, get out here!
- [ Honking ]
- Hey, George!
George! Doc says you better come right now!
- What's the matter?
- Come on, man! It's an emergency!
You gotta learn how to talk Portuguese on the way over there.
I gotta go.
Portuguese?
- Learn Portuguese?
- Why don't you go along, Professor?
George! Doc's inside.
He thinks it's food poisoning.
[ Man ]
Hey, George.
- Hey, Doc. George is here.
- [ Sighs ]
He's gonna be fine, George, but his grandson is missing.
Now, if they ate the same thing, the boy could be a lot worse off.
- You brought the book?
- Yeah, I have it.
Okay. Ask him where the boy is.
Onde esta o menino?
- Va ao pomar.
- He's in orchard.
He said, 'He's in the orchard.'
- Right. Okay.
- [ George ] Diga.
[ Patient ]
Meu neto, Alberto.
- Uma coisa que eu comi.
- Mmm.
Eu tenho medo. Vao depressa achar o Alberto. Depressa!
He said that they ate something bad, and he thinks the boy-- the boy is sick.
Calma. Eles irao encontrar o menino.
O doutor vai dar uma coisa para ficar melhor.
Calma, calma.
Obrigado. Obrigado.
Tito drove the truck while I-I read the book.
George Malley! You learned the Portuguese language in 20 minutes?
Not all of it.
- What are we lookin' for here? A kid?
- [ Tito ] What's the kid's name?
- Alberto.
- Berto. Alberto. Yeah.
Alberto.
Now, let's spread out and comb these-- comb these trees.
- Everybody, let's go.
Look real careful.
- Okay.
- Call out his name.
- [ All Shouting ] Alberto!
[ Everyone ]
Boy! Alberto! Alberto!
- Alberto!
- Alberto!
Berto!
[ All Shouting ]
Where are you, kid?
Alberto? Wherever you are, we're coming.
[ Calling Continues ]
[ Moans ]
George, what you got?
- [ Moans ]
- Huh? What?
- He's not in the orchard.
- Oh.
- He's sick, Doc.
- Oh.
Mmm.
- He's there.
- Where is he, George? Where?
- Over here.
- Okay. That's good.
We're with you.
We're with you.
[ Tito ]
What's goin' on?
- Oh. Ohh.
- [ Doc ] You okay, George?
It's not me, it's him.
[ Moans ]
Tell me where he is.
[ George ]
I don't know! I don't know.
[ Moaning ]
[ Rattling ]
Dios mio!
[ Moaning ]
[ Tito ]
Look! There's a ladder under there!
Come on.
He was right! Vayamos!
He's up here!
Doc? You better get up here fast.
Good work, George.
[ Groans ]
So is, uh, Wednesday good for you? Say 2:00?
- Sure, Wednesday is good.
- Should I send a car?
No, no, John.
I'll get there on my own.
And I'll have somebody from solar energy there.
- And, uh, anything else?
- Yeah, automotive.
- D-D-Do you have an agricultural school at Berkeley?
- Yeah.
Well, how about for my fertilizer?
- I'll take care of it.
- [ Laughs ]
Hey, George.
Esa mujer con Doc.
- That's the little boy's mom.
- [ Speaking Portuguese ]
She's the only woman talks English, I think.
Oh. It's too bad she wasn't here earlier, huh?
Yeah. But--
I guess she had to look for work, man.
I want you to meet a very special guy.
This is the man who-- who found your son. Okay?
Very special.
This is George Malley.
- This is Ella.
- Hello.
[ Crying ]
- Thank you.
- It's okay.
Thank you.
I'll take you to the hospital, okay?
Thank you, George.
- Way to go, patron.
- Do you know what kind of work she was lookin' for?
Mmm. Cook, I think they say. Housekeeper.
Por que? You know somebody who's looking?
- All right, Nate.
- Thanks, George.
I found a housekeeper for you.
A Portuguese woman. She cooks too.
I think she's perfect for you.
I don't know if I could eat
Portuguese food, George.
Well, she'll cook you anything you want, Nate.
She'll try to make sense of that so-called house that you live in.
- She speak English?
- Oh, a bit. But, uh--
That's what we're gonna do.
We're gonna work on your Portuguese.
- Me?
- Yeah. You got a problem with that?
No, no. It's, uh-- I don't know if that's gonna work, George.
All right. Well, let's try it.
What do you wanna say?
How about, uh, something like, um, um,
'Can you come twice a week?'
Okay. Can you come twice a week?
Okay. Can you come twice a week?
[ In Portuguese ]
You are more beautiful than music.
That sounds complicated, George.
Oh, no! You got your tape recorder and-- and, uh, you'll learn it phonetically.
No problem.
What else?
- Uh, 'How much per day?'
- How much-- Okay. Good.
How much per day?
[ In Portuguese ]
Your face is like a poem.
- I like that one. That one's nice.
- Yeah. Yeah.
- What else?
- Okay, okay. Uh--
- Uh, 'Can you start next week?'
- Perfect. Logical, right? Okay.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Can you start next week?
[ In Portuguese ]
And in your eyes... heaven.
- Beautiful language, huh?
- That's it?
Yep. Work on those.
Yep. Work on those.
You know, George,
I might be pretty good at Portuguese.
[ Coyote Howling ]
[ Howling Continues ]
No. Oh, never mind.
We'll get used to 'em.
If you leave them alone, they'll leave you alone.
It's a good arrangement.
- What are we reading?
- This.
What is this?
Where did you get this?
- From me.
- Oh, this is not a good choice for bedtime.
- Are you still mad at him?
- [ Sighs ] What's the difference?
He's neat, and they say he saved that boy's life at the orchard.
- He's funny.
- We are funny enough.
We laugh all the time.
[ Groans ]
Look, we're reading Black Beauty, and we are not talking about men.
I've got enough to worry about.
Too much.
- [ Al ] What?
- Well, you guys, for one.
We're not little anymore.
I know you're not little anymore, sweetie. But you think that George Malley is safe, and you're afraid of coyotes.
You've got it all backwards.
Here. Find our place.
Go brush your teeth.
I'll be right back. Don't you have a report to do?
Did it.
Ohh. [ Muttering ]
'They're everywhere.'
Oh, Al! Do you really believe this?
Yeah. There's been a lot of UFO people coming into town... since George saw... what he saw.
The word's spreading, Ma.
You just believe what you want to believe. Most people do.
- [ Coyote Howling ]
- You get over it.
Hey, I thought we were getting ready for bed.
No.
[ Sighs ]
- Stop talking about him, all right?
- Why do you hate him?
- [ Exhales ] Because I like him.
- Told you.
[ Mimicking Glory ]
Told you.
But if he was sitting here with us right now, wouldn't you be watching him?
Wondering what's he thinking?
When's he gonna leave?
Is he gonna leave? Hmm?
- We don't need that.
- [ Coyote Howls ]
It's okay. Shh.
- [ Tito ] He found the kid and left--
- I heard he took 20 minutes.
Twenty minutes, he read the whole damn book, knew Portuguese.
- [ Man ] You were there!
- [ Woman ] He went running around in the orchard.
[ Jimmy ] Shh. Here he comes.
Here he comes.
- [ Jimmy ] Hey, George.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- [ Sighs ]
- So, George.
How'd you feel that earthquake comin'?
- Voices tell you?
- Voices? Hell, no.
What else do you know, George?
Well, I know you're on the outs with Lisa again.
- How did you know that?
- Well, 'cause when she's livin' with you,
- she makes sure your clothes match.
- [ Laughs ]
- [ Man ] Poor Banes.
- Do you get messages, George?
Yeah. Well, yeah. When, uh,
Paulette delivers the mail, I do.
But today she was two hours late.
I think we ought to do something about that.
Complain or something.
- Earthquake. Earthquake. Can we--
- Well, you know, Jimmy.
It was just-- I was out by Ash Creek, and I felt some vibrations, that's all.
- How'd you know where to find the boy in that orchard?
- Oh, I don't know, Bonnie.
- Come on.
- Do you know what's going to happen?
Roger! Come on.
I'm sorry, I--
They say at the library you read four books a day now.
Yeah, well, that was last week, and--
[ Sighs ]
I-- I better go.
How many languages do you speak now?
- Excusez-moi, Jimmy.
- Huh?
If anything bad was gonna happen, you'd tell us.
Won't you? Hey!
[ Women Chattering ]
- All right.
- Excuse me?
- Hi, Lace.
- Hello.
I'm sorry I lied to you about the chairs.
I-I just wanted you to come to my shop... so-- so you would talk to me.
Instead of, um-- Instead of always walking away from me.
What do you want, George?
I want you to come to Berkeley with me. I-I've been invited to talk to, uh, some scientists... about the earthquake thing and about some of my-- my experiments.
You know, the-- the fertilizer and the solar panels and--
- That's really nice.
- I'm excited, but I--
I guess I'm scared too.
I sure would like you there with me.
- What for?
- Support.
Confidence. A friend.
You've got friends. You know everyone in the whole area code.
I don't know. You know, since that orchard thing, it--
People are different now.
They're-- I don't like it.
[ Chuckling ] You know, the-- the funny thing is-- is that... you're probably the only one that-- that-- that's mad at me for a good reason.
You're just tryin' to make up.
Yes. I'm tryin' to make up with you.
I am tryin' to get a date with you.
And I would love it if you stood by me while all those scientists... and teachers ask me questions.
You know, I-I spent half of school in detention.
- [ Scoffs ]
- [ Laughs ]
- When?
- Wednesday.
- What time?
- Leave about noon.
I'll be outside your shop at noon if I'm coming.
And if I'm not there--
Okay. Thanks, Lace.
[ Exhales ]
- [ Diana Ross, Muffled ]
- [ Nate ] Touch
Me in the morning
Then just walk away
[ Knock At Door ]
We don't have tomorrow
Uh... one second.
One second.
Here I come.
You are Mr.Pope?
You are Mr.Pope?
I am Michaela.
'Mick-Ella.' Mm?
- You're Ella?
- [ Chuckling ] Uh, yes.
[ Chuckles ]
Wow.
- Oh. I-I'm sorry. Please.
- Oh. Um. Maybe you need to--
- [ Ella ] Yes, this is the place.
- [ Nate Chuckles ]
- I cook too. You need cooking?
- Cooking.
- Yeah. [ Laughs ]
- Good. Fine. Good.
- Um, how much you pay?
- Uh, I--
Oh, wait.
Uh, I-I-I speak a little Portuguese.
Oh, muito bem!
Assim vamos entender-nos.
- [ Laughs ]
- Uh, aonde aprendeu portugues?
[ Chuckling ] I don't know what you just said, but it sounded great.
- [ Laughs ] Um--
- Sorry.
Okay, uh, tomorrow
I come back.
9:00. Okay?
I work, and we talk about money.
No, wait.
Es mais bonita do que uma sinfonia.
That's all I really know.
That and, um--
Teu rosto e um poema.
E teus olhos, o ceu.
Is that right?
[ Laughs ]
You're cute.
- Tomorrow.
- Mm.
Tomorrow, then.
CQ. CQ.
This is WB6QLF.
Diana, if you can hear me,
I know you'll understand this.
I just met... an angel... from Portugal.
Here.
In my house.
[ Police Dispatcher On Radio ]
You George Malley?
Jack Hatch, FBI.
Nate Pope sent a coded message to Masterson Air Force Base.
No, no, no. Nate-- Nate Pope did not send a coded message to the air force base.
- I-I did.
- Well, who taught you the cipher, Mr.Malley?
Nobody. I just broke-- broke the code.
- Who trained you?
- As I said, nobody. I--
[ Groans ]
Oh, man.
Mm-hmm.
[ Electronic Beeping ]
Well?
[ Clears Throat ]
Can't do it.
You can do it, Mr.Malley.
Too complex.
We're releasing Nathan Pope.
[ Sighs ] It's about time.
Can I talk to him?
[ Official ] No.
Try this one.
You know, i-it was just a game, okay? I mean, a game.
You caused the cancellation of a top secret training exercise, Mr.Malley.
The scrapping of an entire cipher system.
You cost the government a lot of money.
[ Sighs ] So bill me.
- [ Electronic Beeping ]
- [ Sighs ]
[ Woman ] I think he's what he says he is-- a fluke.
- He's an independent, playing some kind of genius games.
- I want him tested.
- Can't keep holdin' him.
- Yes, we can.
- He resisted arrest.
- No, he didn't.
Yes. He did.
Test him.
All right. I'll start the questions, and I'll be timing your responses.
And we'll be recording.
Any questions?
- What's your first name?
- Uh, my first name is Bob.
- [ Chuckles ] Hi.
- Shoot, Bob.
Right.
Name as many mammals as you can in 60 seconds.
- Ready? Go.
- [ Stopwatch Beeps ]
Hmm. Sixty seconds.
Well, how would you like that?
How about alphabetical?
Aardvark, baboon, caribou, dolphin, eohippus, fox, gorilla, hyena, ibex, jackal, kangaroo, lion, marmoset, Newfoundland, ocelot, panda, rat, sloth, tiger, unicorn, varmint, whale, yak, zebra.
Now, varmint is a stretch.
So is Newfoundland.
That's a dog breed.
Unicorn is mythical; eohippus is prehistoric.
But you weren't being very specific, now, were you, Bob?
- [ Watch Beeps ]
- [ Chuckles ]
Well. Uh, I'll--
I'll try to be more specific.
- Ready for the next one?
- Shoot.
Answer as quickly as you can.
- How old is a person born in 1928?
- [ Beep ]
- Man or woman?
- [ Beep ]
Why?
- Specifics, Bob.
- Okay. One more time.
- How old is a man born in 1928?
- [ Beep ]
- Still alive?
- [ Beep ]
If a man is born in 1928...
- and he's still alive, how old is he?
- [ Beep ]
- What month?
- [ Beep ]
If a man was born...
October 3, 1928,
- and he's still alive, how old is he?
- [ Beep ]
- What time?
- [ Beep ]
- 10:00... p.m.
- [ Beep ]
- Where?
- [ Beep ]
- Anywhere!
Well, let's get specific, Bob.
I mean, if the guy's still alive, born in California,
October 3, 1928, he's 67 years, 9 months,
22 days, 14 hours and-- and 12 minutes.
If he's born in New York, he's three hours older, now, isn't he?
Mmm.
[ Grunts ]
How do you do that?
How do you-- How do you make that pencil move?
Is that a trick pencil?
No. I ask it to move.
I mean, I could say that I will it, but that would be more like a command.
This is more like a collaboration, a partnership.
- Partnership?
- Mm-hmm.
- With a pencil.
- Well, why not?
We're all made up of the same stuff, aren't we?
- Wood?
- Energy, Bob.
- You know, the little pieces.
- Right, yeah.
I wanna go home. How the hell can I get home, Bob?
I don't know. Sorry.
Hey.
- They say you haven't slept.
- Mm.
Who's that?
My keepers?
I'm all right.
You know, you're a pretty gifted man,
Mr.Malley.
- [ Scoffs ]
- No, no, really. We were hopin'--
Well, I was kind of hopin' that you might find something that you enjoy doing.
Something useful in our world.
- Your world?
- Intelligence.
Ah, no, no, no.
It's home for me, Jack.
I'm jumpin' out of my skin here.
I mean, I want my life.
I-I want my life.
[ Sighs ]
What do you want?
- It's not what I want.
- What do they want?
They want to feel safe.
They don't feel safe with you out there.
Whoa. Why would they? They've been havin' me break codes all night.
Secret codes.
I mean-- There--
I shouldn't be listening to a code from Britain to Saudi Arabia.
These are our allies! I-If you guys are gonna accuse me of a crime... or keep me here, uh, I'll tell the press.
Or I'll call London or Riyadh.
I know all the, uh, capitals now, by the way.
You can test me.
My interest in Mr.Malley has to do with seismology and geology.
It has nothing to do with security issues.
Oh, I know. But that's not the point. Mr.Malley has been released without charges.
But he is considered a security risk.
I'll be frank with you.
He's an unknown quantity.
We'd feel better, for the time being, if he wasn't granted any access to the institutions... where sensitive government projects are in the works.
- Access?
- Access even to personnel.
[ Knock At Door ]
- [ George ] Lace!
- Oh.
- I-It's me.
- [ Sighs ]
- Hi.
- Hi.
Sorry I-- I didn't come through the front door,
- but I was so afraid
I'd wake the kids.
- Oh, that's okay. That's okay.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. I wanted to see you.
- [ Sighs ]
Nate told me about the FBI.
- [ Groans ]
- I'm so glad they let you go.
- Yeah, well, they had no choice.
But they-- they are watching me so closely.
I think I scare them.
You scare me too.
I do?
Hmm.
[ Sniffles ]
Listen, George.
It's getting really complicated. I just--
I just don't know what's gonna happen next.
I should probably leave you alone, shouldn't I?
I-- I guess so.
I'll see you.
[ Whispers ]
Good-bye.
[ Sighs ]
Hey.
- You want a beer, George?
- Yup.
Look, Nate.
I am really sorry for what happened. Okay?
I told them everything, George.
I told them everything about you. Everything.
Well, you know, that's supposed to happen. Okay?
- I mean, you know, it's, uh--
- You just think you're not gonna be so scared.
And you're just sittin' there.
You don't know what's gonna happen.
And then all of a sudden, something happens inside you, right?
You don't know what it is, but--
It's all right.
I-It was my game. You know?
What'd they do to you, George?
[ Exhales ]
They tested me.
Wh-What'd they find out?
[ Sighs ]
I'm pregnant.
- [ Chuckles ]
- That's how it feels.
- How what feels?
- You know, to be full of ideas and you can't deliver. Okay?
I mean, you know, you're ready to break out, and you can't deliver!
Y-You know, uh, this professor, he won't even talk to me.
He won't even talk to me.
- You're not going to Berkeley, George?
- Come on. Me at Berkeley?
- That's a thought, huh?
- I'm sorry, buddy.
You mean inventions?
You got inventions?
No, no, ideas. Okay?
I got a thousand ideas a day.
E-Every d-damn minute! Okay?
B-Big 'holy cow' kind of ideas.
And little 'what if' ideas, all right?
I-I got you-- ideas for you,
Jimmy. Look at this.
Look at this. Your parking lot.
It's laid out all wrong, okay?
Now, if you just follow this, right?
You can put six more cars in, and nobody gets fender benders.
All right? Where's Paulette?
Where is she?
Bonnie. Here. Take this.
It's a new route for her mail, okay?
Now, if she does this, she can save an hour a day and everybody gets their mail by 3:00.
Imagine! 3:00. Oh, and I got a 'holy shit' idea too. Look at this.
Now, this may be the most efficient way to store solar energy. Okay? Take it!
- Well, what am I gonna do with it?
- What the hell... am I supposed to do with it, huh?
You know what that light was?
You know what that sound was?
- Tell us. Well, tell us!
- I'm gonna tell you what it was.
- It was a damn alien!
- Don't say that.
You don't know what it was.
- I know what it is, Nate.
- You don't know what it was!
Don't say that!
- Well, tell us!
- It's a goddamn mistake is what it is!
Okay? It was supposed to happen to someone smart.
Someone-- Someone scientific.
Someone who's a leader.
But it didn't. It happened to me, George freakin' Malley!
Look at him!
Now, look at him! Look!
[ Sighs ]
Jimmy.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry.
- Well, i-it's all right.
- I-I-I'll pay for it.
- All right.
Bonnie. Bonnie, please.
I-It's okay.
Oh, man.
Mm-hmm.
- Okay.
- Who was that? A customer?
It's Banes. He says he can't work here no more.
Sorry.
Well, why didn't he talk to me?
Little bit scared, I guess.
- Jesus Christ.
- Look, George. It'll wear off.
They'll forget. Their cars are gonna break down--
- Hi.
- Hey, Doc.
Hi.
Energy vibrations?
What is it?
- I don't know.
- Telekinesis? What?
- Yeah, maybe. Uh, maybe, yeah.
- Think it's gettin out of hand?
Look, look. I-- I was mad, all right? I was pissed off, and I'm not mad now, okay?
Good. I'll sound the all clear, call off the paratroopers. [ Laughs ]
Jesus, George.
Now, listen.
- You owe me a CAT scan.
I want more blood.
- Mm-hmm.
- Also, you look like hell.
- Aah. That's good. Doc, what's the matter with everybody?
They won't give me a chance to explain anything.
I look-- I look at them, and they-- they look at me like
I'm a green bug or something!
- Give them some time, George.
- Now, look! I have an idea.
Now, you look at this.
Now, look at this.
Now, look at that. Now, I-I'm a big deal at the Harmon library.
I-I can take up to 30 books a night. Okay?
And I told them I'd be part of this.
I said that I-I'd put out a table.
- Pressure is way up there.
- Then I would sit there, and they could ask me questions.
You know, 'Meet George Malley.'
What do you think?
- Uh, like a circus attraction.
- Oh, God, Doc. Please?
You know, I-- See, I-I can explain to them once and for all.
I-I could share my ideas with them. Y-You know. And then I-I could get my life back together.
Come see me for that scan.
Take it easy on sugar and salt. Okay?
And do like I told you all your life:
Breathe in and out. Okay, George?
[ Chuckles ] Yeah.
[ Breathing Heavily ]
[ Wind Whistling ]
- [ Glory ] Come on, give it.
- [ Al ] No.
- Give it! Come on!
- No! You're not careful.
You'll break it.
- Al! What've you got there?
- [ Glory ] Please,
I just wanna look at it.
Hey. That's dangerous, sweetie.
- He bought it.
- What?
It's a piece of the mirror George broke.
Richard Smick is selling them at school.
- Oh, you're kidding.
- It's hot! Feel it.
- That's not hot!
- Richard said the aliens probably took George Malley away...
- and put this man in his place.
- This man?
Like he's not human.
That's really dumb.
And it's really mean.
Can't they just look in his eyes and see who he is? Can't you?
Do you remember when Daddy left, how people treated us differently?
Even our so-called friends?
Remember how much it hurt?
You don't do that to people.
How much you pay for that?
- A... quarter.
- A dollar.
- What's the truth, Al?
- I paid a dollar. I was gonna check it with my magnets.
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
- Do you see something really strange in there?
- What?
- What?
- A sucker.
- No.
- You paid a dollar for nothing.
- You're a goner!
- Nice job, Al! [ Giggles ]
[ Al Arguing,
Glory Giggling ]
Hmm.
Lace.
Hi.
Hi.
I just--
I just called you.
- You did?
- Mmm. Come in. Come in.
- [ Clears Throat ]
- I'm so-- so glad you came.
Well, I was just--
Why-- Why were you calling?
I found some things out, Lace.
Things, uh, are coming clearer to me.
Or at least they're-- they're starting to.
- Things?
- Mmm.
I want to talk to the people, Lace.
I-I don't want them to be scared of me or-- or frightened.
I-I mean, I wanna--
I wanna tell them what I know.
So I've-- I've decided to speak at the library fair.
Do you-- Do you think that they'll listen to me?
What would they do?
[ Chuckles ] Throw stones?
Oh, my God. Please, sit down.
I can't believe this.
- Would you like something to drink? A beer?
- No.
What? What can I get you?
Scissors.
I can hear her heartbeat
From a thousand miles
And the heavens open up
Every time she smiles
And when I come to her
That is where I belong
And I'm runnin' through her
Like a river song
She gives me love love, love, love
Crazy love
She gives me love love, love, love
Crazy love
She's got a fine sense of humor
When I'm feelin' low down
And I'm comin' to her
When the sun goes down
Take away my troubles
Oh, take away my grief
Take away my heartaches
In the night like a thief
She gives me love love, love, love
Crazy love
She gives me love love, love, love
Crazy love
And I need her in the daytime
I need her
And I need her in the night
I need her
And I wanna throw my arms
- Around her
- Have you done this before?
- Nope.
- Kiss and hug her
Kiss and hug her tight
Ah
Up or down?
- Down.
- When I'm returning
From so far away
Gives me some sweeter lovin'
Brightens up my day
And it makes me righteous
And it makes me whole
And it makes me mellow
Right down to my soul
She gives me love love, love, love
Crazy love
She gives me love love, love, love
Crazy love
- Love, love
- Is it close enough?
- Love, love
Crazy love
- You tell me.
- You give me love
- Love, love
- Give me love
- Love, love
- Crazy love
- Ah, that's pretty close.
- Love
- Love, love, love, love
Crazy love
- You give me love
- Love, love, love, love
Crazy love
[ Sighs ]
You're running away?
Are you coming back?
Mmm.
Hope so.
- [ Al ] Let me see the popcorn.
- [ Glory ] No.
[ Kids Arguing,
People Chattering ]
Good luck, George.
Oh, hi, Doc.
- Welcome.
- Do you improve your mind with all this reading?
Yes, Doc.
Lady Chatterley's Lover?
- [ Everyone Laughs ]
- Huh?
Yeah. Uh-- All right, well, you know, that's kind of a--
That's kind of a code book for anyone who, uh, wants to understand a woman's heart and mind;
I-I read it twice.
[ Laughter ]
Can you, uh-- Can you name the presidents forwards and backwards for these people?
No. But I can name some, uh, forward presidents and some backward ones.
You know, I-I can really only tell you what I've read in these books.
- He looks better.
- Yeah. Yeah. He does.
[ George ] I seem to have an increased capacity for-- for learning.
- Right now.
- How do we know you've read all these books?
Well, um, ask me something. Uh--
I'd be-- I'd be glad to answer any question that you have, or--
How did you break that mirror, George, without even touching it?
Now, I want to talk to you about that, Banes, because I know-- I know you've been worried about it, and, um--
Okay. Come here. Come here.
Everybody gather closely.
I'm gonna--
May I use your glasses?
What you're about to see is not a trick. Okay? I-It's just, um--
Well, l-let's just call it an experiment in energy.
Cool!
- [ George ]
Well, everything there is...
- You getting this? is made up of some living energy, okay?
See, now, all this is-- is, uh-- is kind of a dance... or partnership between the energy coming from me... and the, uh, energy of the plastic.
- Now-- Now, th-th-that's it.
- Well, why can't we do it?
Well, focus. Um, uh, clarity of thought.
I-I don't know.
M-Maybe you can, Banes.
What about the UFOs?
What are they?
- I don't know that either.
- Yes, you do. Yes, you do!
Um, this power began the night that you saw the object in the sky.
Th-That-- That was a light.
Now-- Now, let me just finish this one thing.
N-Now, we're talking about a partnership.
Do you-- Do you know what the largest living organism in the world is?
Okay. It's a grove of aspen trees in Colorado, acres of aspens.
Okay. Now, they thought they were disconnected, separate.
But, indeed, they found out that they weren't.
That-- That there was one giant organism with the same root system.
Uh, what sort of light was it?
- Now-- Now, that's not unlike us.
- [ Man ] Answer the question!
- We think that-- that--
- Why won't you tell us what you know about the UFOs?
- Can you move the table?
- [ Reporter ] How did you feel when you saw that light?
- I think you know more than you're telling us!
- Now, imagine--
Have you seen the light since the 28th?
- [ UFO Enthusiast ]
Are you hiding something?
- [ Man ] Hey! Come on!
- Just put your hands on my boy.
- It was aliens.
- Move the glasses some more!
- Can you bend spoons?
- We know what you can do.
- Leave George alone!
- Touch the boy!
- Please, he's dying.
- George! George!
- [ People Screaming ]
[ Roaring Sound ]
[ Nate ]
George. George, can you see me?
George. George.
You okay?
[ Roaring Continues ]
[ Zapping ]
Mr.Malley?
Are you all right?
Good to see you.
You look sorrowful.
No.
What's the matter? Can't think of any more tests to give me?
How did you, uh, manage to get your pressure to come down?
Oh, I found my pace.
Simple thing, really.
Hard to explain.
Why, you figure
I'm too thick?
What I figure about you... is that you're stalling.
I'm not stalling, though.
I'm-- I'm waiting.
- For what?
- Reinforcements.
[ Laughs ]
Ah. Yeah.
You pick good people.
You bet.
See, uh--
George. George.
There's a tumor in your brain...
- [ Scoffs ]
- that's spread out like a hand.
Threads of it, you know, everywhere.
But instead of dysfunction--
Now, here's the mystery, George.
Instead of destroying brain function, so far, it's been stimulating it.
And we can't understand that.
You have more area of active brain use than anybody ever tested.
Ever. B-Because of those tentacles.
I mean, we've seen tumors like this before.
It's called astrocytoma.
And it explains the-- the dizziness and... the illusion of light.
But the way it's in there, waking up areas of the brain, it's a... big mystery, so--
And it's killing me.
- Well, uh--
- For sure?
We got a call from the best brain man in the country.
I mean, actually he's one of the best in the world.
He's gonna study your tests and then talk to you.
But, uh, the blood flow is in danger now.
And, uh, you're gonna start to weaken, maybe... black out.
We-- We really don't know.
It's--
But it's a damn lousy scenario, you see.
[ Sighs ]
Let me sit down here a minute.
[ Sighs ]
Goddamn it.
S-Something happened about 25 years ago... when you broke your leg and I set it, George.
I don't know what to call it. But, uh--
Somehow you got into my heart more than most.
And for--
[ Choking Up ]
And for a man who's never been a father,
I sure feel like I'm losing a son.
[ Doc ] Yeah.
Georgie. Yeah.
[ Nate ] Can I do something for you, George?
- Anything?
- Yes.
Next spring, when you plant the south 40,
I want you to use the new fertilizer.
I want you to put corn in that field.
And I know what you're thinking.
You're thinking... that it's just too tough a-a crop, but it's not.
I'm telling you.
You'll get four to five years... without rotation.
Now, trust me on this.
Okay.
I'm gonna wait outside.
- Okay.
- Doc, you wanna... come with me?
Yeah. Okay.
Bye, Doc.
Now, uh, he didn't say how long.
Days or weeks.
They don't--
They don't know.
I'm so sorry, Lace.
I know how you hate surprises.
[ Laughs ] I tried so hard not to love you.
- How'd you make out?
- Terrible.
Hey. Would you, uh, love me the rest of my life?
Nah. I'm gonna love you for the rest of mine.
George Malley?
I'm Dr.Wellin.
George, I'm recording this because I'm going to be asking you...
- some very important questions.
- Mm.
- You ready?
- Not another test.
No. No, no.
No more tests.
A dialogue.
I'm going to ask for your permission for my team to perform open-brain surgery.
- [ Murmurs ]
- But I don't want you to answer...
- 'til we've had our dialogue.
- B-B-But y-you said that this tumor was inoperable.
I think the odds are very small, say, one in five hundred, that we'd be able to remove enough of the tumor to even prolong your life.
- Well, why-- why--
- But what I want to explain... is that this would not be a lifesaving operation.
[ Inhales ]
This would be--
Call it an expedition.
This would be a voyage of discovery.
You're in a position to contribute as much to our knowledge... as any man or woman who's come before you.
And if you were to wait, and, uh, do this operation... after I'm done with my brain, what would, uh--
If that's what you want, yes, an autopsy. That's all we'll do.
But that wouldn't be as useful.
The study of a living, active brain would tell us volumes.
All right, so, if you were to do this operation, wouldn't it most likely kill me... or at least shorten my life?
George, I-- I'm asking you to try and see the larger picture.
- Mm-hmm.
- To realize what you have... to offer to us, the ones you're leaving behind.
You could be our greatest teacher, George.
Hmm?
I can be your biographer, in a sense.
I can present you to the world.
But that's not me.
That's just my brain.
Do you understand?
Look, Doctor.
You know, I just might have something to say in my last few hours.
I just might have something to say.
What you're saying is that
I have something to teach.
And yet you're willing to end me to study my brain under a microscope.
- N-Now, is that all I'm here for?
- What else?
- You're not a scholar or a--
- I'll tell you what I am, okay?
I-I'll tell you what I think I am.
I think I'm what everybody can be.
- Everyone with a malignant, tentacled--
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
I-It's-- It's-- Th-Th-That just helped me get here, okay?
I mean, anybody can get here. It's--
I'm-- I'm the possibility, all right?
I mean, I think you've got this desperate grasp on, uh, technology... and this grasp on science, and, uh, you don't have a-- a hand left to-- to grasp what's important.
- George, now, George--
- If I had to choose between a tumor that got me here... and some flash of light from an alien craft,
I'd choose the tumor; I would, because it's here within us.
What I'm talking about is the human spirit.
That's the challenge.
That's the voyage.
That's the expedition.
You need to go now.
I need my rest, and, uh, I wanna go home.
[ People Chattering ]
Hey, hey, hey.
- I tried to release my patient.
Now, what's going on?
- It's done.
- What's done?
- We didn't feel George Malley was competent to make the decision.
He's a surgical patient now.
Oh, what did you tell the judge?
That you could save him?
- I might prolong his life, yes.
- Bullshit.
If he were rational, he'd say yes.
You know he would.
Now I know why you guys wear masks.
[ Banes ] Yeah, if it was light enough, he could have been blowing on it with his breath.
You know, he could've had a string.
So thin, you know, like, uh, catgut.
He could've had it on his finger and on the glasses, and he could've made it move that way.
[ Roger ] Don't you think he-- he could've, uh, thrown s-something at that mirror somehow? We just--
We just didn't see it.
- [ Jimmy ] No way.
- That quake could've been a coincidence.
He just thought he knew stuff.
I mean, he just studied harder on the Spanish, that's all.
It's not like he really knew stuff.
Just studied hard at chess... and made us think he was changing.
But-- You know, I mean, he never really changed at all. Isn't that right, Doc?
I mean, he never really got any smarter. [ Chuckles ]
- Doc?
- Banes.
How's your lady love?
[ Clears Throat ]
We, uh-- We broke up.
Oh. Really?
That's too bad.
Yeah. Now, George, he's got a love at his side, and she's stickin' with him.
You know why? Because he bought her chairs.
That's pretty smart to me.
You ever buy Lisa's chairs?
[ Laughs ] God, Doc's really drunk tonight. God!
Every woman has her chairs. Something she needs to put herself into, Banes.
You ever figure out what
Lisa's chairs were and buy 'em?
Nope.
[ Chuckles ]
But you're right about one thing.
George never changed.
Never. No, never.
- Doc's makin' no sense tonight.
- Yeah. Maybe he caught it from George.
- Now, goddamn it, Doc!
- Why do you have to tear him down?
What are you so afraid of?
What have you got to lose?
He wasn't selling anything!
He didn't want anything from anybody!
He wanted nothing from nobody!
Nothing! Nothing!
And you people have to tear him down so you can sleep better tonight?
So you can prove that the world is flat? And sleep better tonight? Am I right?
I'm right.
To hell with all of you.
To hell with every one of you.
[ Woman On P.A. ]
Dr.Robinson--
Hey, George. How you doin'?
Here you go.
- Drink up.
- All right.
Good job.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Don't take the pudding. That's the good part.
- [ Laughs ]
- Hey, is Cal around?
Sure. You wanna see him?
- Yeah. Thanks.
- Okay.
- Hey, dude. How's it goin'?
- Hey, man. All right.
- Can you stay for a few minutes?
- Sure.
- Saved you some pudding again.
- Oh, what a buddy.
I love this stuff.
Night, dude.
- [ Radio Dispatcher Chattering ]
- Hey, Doc. You seen him?
- Seen who? What?
- George Malley. He's out.
He sneaked out.
- We're lookin' all over for him.
- He's out?
Yeah, he flew the coop. Nobody knows where he is. I heard it on the radio.
Flew the coop. Those FBI guys are gonna have me drivin' around all night.
I'm gonna be home late again.
[ Laughing ]
[ Air Hissing ]
I want you to take these and give 'em to Doc.
These I'm taking with me because
I haven't finished 'em yet.
They're for Dr.Ringold.
This I wrote for you, Nate.
It's-- It's about soils and, uh, some of my own thoughts.
- Your thoughts?
- [ Whispers ] Yeah.
- I could drive you.
- No, no, Nate. It's too chancy.
You gonna make it, man.
- Nate.
- George.
[ Whines ]
Pal.
Oh.
- [ Engine Revving ]
- [ Kids Chattering ]
- [ Glory ] I'll get it.
- [ George ] Okay, now you put the top on it.
[ Chatter Continues ]
- [ Al ] I can do it alone.
- [ Glory ] You, Al!
Mmm. Okay.
That tight enough?
Why don't you do it once more?
- Go ahead.
- Okay.
There you go.
Good. Now you fixed it.
What?
You came here to die, didn't you?
But I-- I like this place, and, um,
I love the people here.
You know, if-- if we were to, uh, to put this apple down... and leave it, it would be spoiled and gone within a few days.
But if we were to take a bite of it, like this, it would become part of us.
And we could take it with us forever.
Al.
Everything is on its way... to somewhere.
Everything.
That's a good bite.
Keep an eye out.
- Have you seen George Malley,
Ms.Pennamin?
- What's the point?
Look, it's not my call.
I haven't seen him.
You mind if I get in your truck?
Why?
[ Engine Starts,
Runs Smoothly ]
What's your first name?
Jack.
How would you want to die, Jack?
[ Engine Stops ]
Come on. Let's go.
[ Exhales ]
There you are.
I knew I'd find you here.
What are you working on?
Dr.Ringold's coming tomorrow, and I just wanted to finish this up.
- Finish what?
- Ah, just some possibilities.
Hey, come sit by me.
Hmm?
You scared?
No.
I wish I knew what you feel.
Oh, you do.
You've always known it, Lace.
I'll show you.
When your children were babies, how did you hold them?
[ Chuckles ]
And if they had a hard time sleeping and you had to rock them to sleep, well, how did you do it?
- [ Laughs ]
- See?
Hey. Look what I made back there.
Ah, that looks like a bed.
Are you expecting to get lucky?
No. Just hoping.
When the road gets dark
You can no longer see
Just let my love
Throw a spark, baby
And have a little faith in me
And when the tears you cry
Are all you can believe
Just give these lovin' arms a try, baby
And have a little faith in me
Have a little faith in me
Have a little faith in me
Have a little faith in me
Have a little faith in me
- Hey, I never kissed you there.
- Mm. No.
- Keeping track?
- Mm-hmm.
You going to sleep?
Huh-uh.
Are you?
No. And I don't want to sleep unless you're sleeping.
I don't want to--
- Lace.
- What?
- Sweetheart.
- What?
Now, you have to listen to me now.
What?
It's happening.
- No.
- Mm-hmm.
No. Wait, George. Wait.
- No.
- And it's gonna be okay.
- George.
- It's okay.
It's gonna be okay.
Okay.
- Good-bye, honey.
- No.
Oh.
Oh.
Hello. I'm John Ringold.
I'm here to see George Malley.
Oh! I'm sorry, John.
George Malley passed away last night.
Wh--
I-I'm sorry.
He left these for you.
He said they're not finished.
You'll have to do it.
I'll do my best.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Good-bye.
- Bye.
[ Crying ]
[ Wind Whistling ]
[ Sighs ]
Thank you, sweetie.
- [ Speaking Portuguese ]
- [ Chuckles ]
- Nate, they'll be waiting for you.
- We're comin'. We're comin'.
If I could reach the stars
Pull one down for you
Shine it on my heart
So you could see the truth
That this love
I have inside
- Is everything it seems
- [ Nate ] Beautiful.
- Is everything it seems
- [ Nate ] Beautiful.
But for now I find
- Whoo. Whoo.
- [ Speaking Portuguese ]
- It's only in my dreams
- It's okay. It's okay.
- But I can't change the world
- [ Jimmy ] Hey, Nate!
- Hi, Ella!
- You look beautiful.
What am I gonna do with this?
- What am I gonna do?
- You would think my love was really something good
- [ Everyone Chattering ]
- Baby, if you knew that I
- Could change
- Not here.
- The world
- It's not here.
Tell you where it is.
- It's right there!
- How did you do that?
- How did I do that? It's magic.
- [ Bonnie ] Good job.
Can you hear her?
She just kicked.
- [ Tito ] Baby, huh?
- Yeah.
- Change the world
- Have a cold one.
- You gettin' any rest?
- [ Sighs ] Not much.
Well, get it now, because there's no sleepin' once the baby gets here.
- You would think my love was really something good
- Check.
Baby, if I could
- Change
- Go on now. Think it through.
Think it through.
The world
[ Everyone Chattering ]
Ah, ah
I was thinkin' out loud
One life's such a short time for love
When a match made in heaven arrives
Eternity is never enough
I need to dance
With life
Sweep you away into the night
When there is no one else around
I will make every day count
We need to dance
With life
Swim in the soul of your eyes
'Til we melt into the ground
Oh, we need to dance with life
And leave a brilliant light
Behind
It's no secret how I feel
This special moment
I love you
You seem to cover me up
And hide me deep
Deep in me
To dance with life
Breathe the sweet, fresh air
And make every second your last
And I'll touch you
A full moon shall wake you
Make the most of the present and the past
I need to dance
With life
Sweep you away into the night
When there is no one else around
I will make every day count
We need to dance
With life
Swim in the soul of your eyes
'Til we melt into the ground
Oh, we need to dance with life
And leave a brilliant light
Leave a brilliant light
Leave a brilliant light
Behind

Pensacola, where's Pensacola?
I'll give you a hint.
Orange juice.
Copy that, K-4 WLD.
How's the weather down there in Florida?
TED:
Pensacola, Florida.
I have to tell you, Sparks...
...one thousand, one hundred and sixteen miles.
Pretty good. That's the farthest yet.
ELLIE: Can we hear all the way to New York?
TED: Sure.
ELLIE: Can we hear all the way to California?
TED: I don't see why not.
ELLIE: Can we hear all the way to Alaska?
TED: Yeah, on a really clear day.
ELLIE:
Can we hear all the way to China?
TED:
On a really, really clear day.
[CHUCKLING]
ELLIE:
Could we talk to the moon?
TED: Well, if it's a big enough radio,
I don't see why not.
ELLIE:
Could we talk to Jupiter?
Or what's the one after that?
Don't tell me.
TED:
I'll give you a hint.
Hula-Hoops.
- Saturn. Could we talk to Saturn?
- Mm-hm.
Dad, could we talk to Mom?
I don't think even the biggest radio could reach that far.
All right, no more stalling.
Okay.
Pensacola.
Oh, Ellie, that's a beauty.
Now get some sleep.
- Hey, Dad?
- Yeah?
Do you think there's people on other planets?
I don't know, Sparks.

[STATIC BUZZING OVER RADIO]
Go back.
Try back a little bit.
You had something there.
[WHIRRING ON RADIO]
There.
- Right there?
- You hear it? Right there, that's it.
ELLIE: All right, 1221.46.
That's well within the L band.
- Check off-axis.
- Uh-huh. On it.
It's not in the neighborhood.
Ah.
Here it is. J-1741 plus 2748.
Catalogued November 4, 1982. Pulsar.
Well, I don't know, it must've been...
The glitch in the timing is what threw me.
Must've been a starquake.
[WHIRRING STOPS]
I think it's great that you listen.
Most people don't do that anymore.
It's just an old habit.
You know, it makes it feel more real.
- Ellie.
- Kent. Kent Clark.
Hey.
They said you've been up at Owens Valley working under Drumlin.
How did you like him?
[ELLIE SIGHS]
That much? And about what I'd expect after what he had to say about you.
What was that?
That you are brilliant, driven...
...a major pain in the ass, and obsessed with a field of study...
...that he considers tantamount to professional suicide.
- Anything else?
- Those were the highlights.
Davio, Dr. Vernon. Dr. Arroway.
ELLIE: Hey. Hi there.
- How you doing?
And I believe you've already met our tireless research assistant, Mr. Fisher...
- Here, I need you to sign...
...as well as his cologne.
Brook's looking at the black hole at the center of M-87.
Eli's studying Markarian 541, a major gamma-ray source.
And Dr. Arroway will be spending her precious telescope time listening for, um...
Listening for...
Little green men.
One down, a couple billion to go.
[SPEAKING IN SPANISH]
Arecibo, right?
Does it show?
Yeah.
- Cracker Jack?
- No, thanks.
- Mind if I sit down?
- Sure.
I hear the locals, they call it El Radar.
Convinced it has some dark military purpose.
I think we're pretty harmless.
Palmer Joss.
- Ellie Arroway.
- Nice to meet you, Ellie.
What are you studying up there?
The usual.
You know. Nebulae, quasars, pulsars, stuff like that.
What are you...? What are you writing?
The usual. Nouns, adverbs, adjective here and there.
I work on a project called SETI.
Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence?
Wow. Man, that is out there.
Wait, are you a student or something?
Mm-mm. I'm a writer. I'm writing a book.
Down here doing research about how technology affects Third World cultures.
I'm also looking for this guy
David Drumlin.
He's the new head of the National Science
Foundation. I'm trying to get an interview.
- I take it you know him?
- Mm-hm.
You could say that.
SETI, man. That's fringe.
I've crossed paths with this guy.
Something like that must really chap his ass, huh?
Compass.
For you, EI.
You better keep this.
Might save your life someday.
Will you have dinner with me tonight?
I...
I don't make a very good research subject.
I'm just not very quotable.
No quotes. No quotes. Scout's honor.
Just a good meal, good company.
I gotta go.
But, uh...
Drumlirs coming in this Tuesday.
Now I remember why I took that desk job.
- Dr. Drumlin, how are you?
- Dr. Drumlin.
Glad you could make it, David.
If I'd known it was gonna take three planes, I might've reconsidered.
How is that new office?
I'm still settling in. They already wanna take half my budget and give it to the Pentagon.
Ellie. Still waiting for E.T. To call?
- Well, I understand we're having a little...
- Good to see you too.
Asshole.
Uh-oh. Looks like it's gonna be a long night.
Science must first be accountable to the people who are paying for it, the taxpayers.
We need to stop wasting money on pie-in-the-sky abstractions...
...and start spending it on practical, measurable ways...
...to improve the lives of the people who are footing the bill.
Not unlike my L-band, globular-clusters work.
Wait, you're saying you wanna do away with all pure research now?
What's wrong with science being practical?
Even profitable?
Nothing, as long as your motive is the search for truth.
Which is exactly what the pursuit of science is.
That's a rather interesting position...
...coming from a man on a crusade against the evils of technology...
...Father Joss.
PALMER:
I'm not against technology, doctor.
I'm against the men who deify it at the expense of human truth.
Kent, I've been meaning to have a word with you. Over here, please.
KENT:
Yeah, I'll just...
I think that hurt my chances with that interview. What do you think?
You're a priest?
No, not really.
I got my Masters in Divinity...
...then dropped out of seminary to do some secular humanitarian work...
...coordinating efforts for Third World churches.
I couldn't live with the whole celibacy thing.
You could...
You could call me a man of the cloth...
...without the cloth.
You wanna get out of here?
All right, you see that sort of large,
W-shaped constellation right there?
That's Cassiopeia.
And Cassiopeia A gives off a whole lot of radio signals.
I actually listen to them a lot.
It's a remnant of a supernova.
When did you know you wanted to be an astronomer?
Well, when I...
When I was about 8 years old,
I was watching the sunset...
...and I asked my dad,
"What's that bright star over there?"
Dad, what's that star there?
And he said that it wasrt really a star at all. It was actually...
That's not a star, it's a planet.
- A whole planet called Venus...
That's the planet Venus.
- Which should be over there soon.
He said,
"You know why they called it Venus?
Because they thought it was so beautiful and glowing.
But what they didn't know...
...is that it's filled with...
...deadly gases and sulfuric acid rain."
"Wow," I thought,
"This is it! I'm hooked."
You know, there are four hundred billion stars out there...
...just in our galaxy alone.
If only one out of a million of those had planets...
...all right, and ifjust one out of a million of those had life...
...and ifjust one out of a million of those had intelligent life...
...there would be literally millions of civilizations out there.
Well, if there wasrt...
...it'd be an awful waste of space.
Amen.
PALMER: So I was lying there, just looking at the sky.
And then I felt something. I don't know, I...
All I know is that I wasrt alone.
And for the first time in my life
I wasrt scared of nothing, you know?
Not even dying.
It was God.
And there's no chance that...
...you had this experience because some part of you needed to have it?
I mean, I'm a reasonably intelligent guy, but this...
No, this... No, my intellect, it couldn't even touch this.
No.
I've been to Sunday school a few times.
Uh-huh. And?
Well, I just kept asking all these really annoying questions like:
"All right, then where did Mrs. Cain come from?"
And pretty soon they called my dad and they asked him...
...if he wouldn't mind just keeping me home from now on.
Your dad...
- Is it this guy?
- Yeah.
You're close to him, aren't you?
Yeah, I was.
He died when I was 9 years old.
I never got to know my mother.
I'm sorry.
That's gotta be tough.
Yeah.
Being alone.
What do you say...
...we pack a picnic tomorrow morning and hike up to old Mount Arecibo?
I don't think I can. I gotta work.
All right, how about dinner, then, tomorrow night? I know a great dive.
I don't think so.
- Ellie, did I miss something?
- Huh?
No. Shit, I'm late.
I told Kent that I'd be there at 10:30.
You know, I'm not trying to push you.
No, no. I've wanted to look at this sector for weeks.
Just hang out and sleep in.
And there's a bunch of food in the fridge.
Okay?
How can I reach you?
Just leave your number. I'll call you.
YOUNG ELLIE:
Dad!
Dad, it's starting, you're gonna miss it.
Dad, there's another one. Hurry up.
TED:
In a minute, Sparks. I'm almost done.
There's another one.
Come on, hurry up, Dad!
[CLATTERING]
Dad?
Daddy?
Dad.
I'll get the medicine.
Ellie.
I know it's hard to understand this now...
...but we aren't always meant to know why things happen the way they do.
Sometimes we just have to accept it as God's will.
I should have kept some medicine in the downstairs bathroom.
Then I could've gotten to it sooner.
[CHATTERING]
YOUNG ELLIE:
CQ...
...this is W-9 GFO. Do you copy?
Dad, this is Ellie. Come back.
This is Eleanor Arroway...
...transmitting on 14.2 megahertz.
Dad.
Are you there?
Come back.
Dad.
Are you there?
Dad, this is Ellie.
[BEEPING]
[DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES]
Ellie.
Hi, Kent. What are you doing up so early, huh?
I was thinking...
...we'd make a pretty good team.
What?
We could put together a kick-ass ad-hoc SETI program.
You know the Very Large Array in New Mexico?
It would be a dynamite place to do serious SETI...
What are you talking about, Kent?
Drumlin pulled the plug.
We're homeless.
Hey, watch it.
ELLIE:
Is it true, huh? Did you pull the plug?
You can't see it now, but I'm doing you a favor.
You are far too promising a scientist to be wasting your gifts on this nonsense.
Look, I don't consider what could be...
...the most important discovery of the human race nonsense, okay?
There's 400 billion stars...
And two probabilities.
One, there is intelligent life...
...but it's so far away you'll never contact it in your lifetime.
- And two!
- You're making a decision...
There's nothing but noble gases and carbon compounds and you're wasting your time.
In the meantime, you won't be published, won't be taken seriously.
And your career will be over.
So what? It's my life.
Hey, Kent. You were right.
Screw Drumlin. We're gonna raise the money. We're going to New Mexico.
KENT: Chicago has all the stuff, but let me know how it goes.
I've got some more corporate stops on the East Coast for you.
Hey, Fish, did that investor from Houston ever get back to us?
FISHER:
I'm gonna hit him up on my way to L.A.
ELLIE: Try begging for some of that
Hollywood money.
Why not? They've been making money off of aliens for years, right?
- Begging is good for the soul.
- We'll see about that.
- Just do me a favor.
- Yeah.
Try not to be too confrontational.
Huh? Confrontational? Me?
What do you mean?
I'm gonna see if I left anything.
ELLIE: This is a unique time in our history, in the history of any civilization.
It's the moment of the acquisition of technology.
That's the moment where contact becomes possible.
The Very Large Array in New Mexico is the key to our chances for success.
With its 27 linked radio telescopes...
...we can search more accurately than at any other conventional facility.
Now, we've gotten approval to buy the telescope time from the government.
Now all we really need is the money.
A nice presentation, doctor.
But while our foundation arm has a mandate to support experimental programs...
...we must confess that your proposal seems less like science...
...and more like science fiction.
Science fiction.
You're right.
It's crazy.
In fact, it's even worse than that: Nuts.
You wanna hear something nutty?
A couple guys wanted to build something called an airplane.
You get people to go in it and fly like birds.
Ridiculous, right?
Or what about breaking the sound barrier...
...or rockets to the moon, or atomic energy or a mission to Mars?
Science fiction, right?
Look.
All I'm asking is for you to just have the tiniest bit of vision.
You know, to just step back for one minute and look at the big picture.
To take a chance on something...
...which might end up being the most profoundly impactful moment...
...for humanity, for the history of history.
I'm sorry.
I just spent the last 13 months...
...coming into rooms like this and talking to people like you.
The truth is, you're my last chance, so...
I'm sorry I wasted your time.
Doctor.
Yes, sir.
You have your money.
Thank you.
[MOTOR HUMMING]
MAN:
Oh! Perfect cast. Come on, fishy.
Frank, look at the size of that son of a bitch!
Welcome back, Dr. C.
How'd it go?
- How was the trip?
- I've had better.
Drumlin. What is this?
This his personal vendetta now?
It's not just Drumlin. There's been enormous pressure from other scientists as well.
It doesn't matter anyway,
Hadders funding us for another two years.
Uh... These are government-owned telescopes, they can lease to whomever.
And they don't want the high priestess of the desert using them anymore.
What?
Staring at static on TV for hours, listening to washing machines.
Did you really think these stories wouldn't get out?
- I was looking for patterns in the chaos.
- Doesrt matter, we're a joke to them.
They want us out.
We've got three months until the paperwork goes through.
Fine. I'll start looking for other funding.
I'll just start...
Could you face reality, please?
Just this once, Ellie. We lost.
It's over.
Fine.
But I'm not stopping.
If I have to go it alone, I'll go it alone.
I've done it before.
My guest tonight is author and theologian Palmer Joss.
He's become a spiritual counselor of sorts and a recent fixture at the White House.
"God's Diplomat," according to The New York Times.
His latest book, Losing Faith, is currently number one...
...on that publicatiors bestseller list.
Thanks for being with us, Palmer.
You have had quite a ride this last couple of years.
Yeah, I sure have, Larry.
You know, Fish, I was thinking.
Who would make the best astronomers?
I mean, think about it.
Who has the perfect synthesis of career and lifestyle?
- I give.
- Vampires!
Are you anti-technology?
Are you anti-science?
PALMER:
No, not at all.
The question that I'm asking is this:
Are we happier as a human race?
Is the world fundamentally a better place because of science and technology?
We shop at home, we surf the Web...
...but at the same time we feel emptier...
...and more cut off from each other than at any other time in human history.
I mean, we're becoming a synthesized society...
...in a great, big hurry to get to the next...
I think it's because we're looking for the meaning. What is the meaning?
We have mindless jobs, we take frantic vacations.
Deficit finance trips to the mall to buy more things...
...that we think are gonna fill these holes in our lives.
Is it any wonder that we've lost our sense of direction?
[BUZZING AND PULSING]
Holy shit.

- We're on it.
Plus 36 hours,
47 minutes and 1 second.
Strong possible pulse chain on Sub-Array 4.
I'm moving the rest of them now.
I need you to confirm the coordinates.
Check the status of the array.
- She's doing all the dishes.
- All systems nominal.
Hello.
I need a full systems check.
Coordinates confirmed.
Willie's checking the system now.
Stay on top of the systems diagnostics.
Check the reference point offsets.
And I want you off-axis on 27 the second we get there.
And tell Willie to break out the big boy.
Copy that. Willie...
Yeah. Go, Ellie.
I can hear can it on the headphones.
We gotta be sure about this.
Give me another array status.
Her four are online, the rest are tracking in.
FISHER: Your four are online, the rest are tracking in.
But there's a bad drive on 16.
Your four are online, the rest are tracking in...
...but there's a bad drive on 16.
Copy that?
What do you want me to do about the source queue?
Look, forget about it and hold the queue.
Go get ready to set the target frequency to manual the second we're aligned.
Do you copy? I want you to go off-axis on 27 the second we're there.
And leave the LO frequency where it is.
Stay on it, Fish, don't let it get away.
If you lose it, scan the band.
Run every frequency you can think of.
How you doing?
Talk to me, guys.
Partially polarized set of moving pulses, amplitude modulated.
We're locked. Systems check out, signal across the board. What's the frequency?
4.46, 23 gigahertz.
Hydrogen times pi. Told you.
Strong sucker too.
I got it! I got it, I got it!
I'm patched in.
ELLIE:
All right, let me hear it.
[PULSING]
Listen to that.
Make me a liar, Fish.
It could be AWACS out of Kirtland jamming us.
But I'm doubting it.
All right, let's see if F.U.D.D.'s reading it too.
Willie, patch it back and give me the off-axis.
- Are we recording?
- Never stopped.
Thank you, Elmer.
AWACS status is negative.
- White Sands?
- On this frequency? No.
I'm gonna punch up the darks.
How's the spying tonight, guys?
Come on.
FISHER: NORAD's not tracking any snoops in this vector.
Shuttle Endeavor is in sleep mode.
Okay, point source confirmed.
- Whatever it is, it ain't local.
- Position?
WILLIE: I checked interferometry.
Somewhere in Lyra, I think.
- Vega?
FISHER: Can't be.
It's only 26 light years away.
- What's the peak intensity?
FISHER: Coming up.
ELLIE:
Vega.
Vega. I scanned it a bunch of times at
Arecibo. It was negative results, always.
Got it. Reading over 100 janskys.
Jesus. I could pick it up on my...
[PULSING STOPS]
No.
[PULSING]
Come on.
All right, it's restarting.
Wait a minute. Those are numbers.
That was a three, the one before it was a two.
Base-10 numbers. Just start counting now, see how far can we get.
One.
WILLIE: Seven.
ELLIE: Seven.
Those are primes.
Two, three, five, seven, those are all prime numbers.
There's no way that's a natural phenomenon.
- Holy shit.
- Okay, okay.
Let's just calm down and pull up the star file on Vega.
FISHER: It doesn't make any sense.
The system is too young...
...so it can't have a planetary system...
...let alone life or a technological civilization.
Maybe they didn't grow up there.
Maybe they're visiting.
Spacecraft? This system is full of debris. It would get clobbered.
Well, not if they used their laser blasters and photon torpedoes.
- That's not funny.
- How else are we gonna explain it?
Willie's right. If we go public with this and we're wrong, that's it.
It's over. We're cooked.
God, I wish Kent was here.
Whatever the signal is, we better do something soon. Vega's gonna set.
Position confirmed.
We've got 4.4623 gigahertz, confirmed.
We've got 112 janskys.
All right, do you have a source location yet?
We put it right smack in the middle.
Vega.
Okay, thanks, lan. Keep tracking and we'll get back to you.
Yeah, right-o.
FISHER:
Okay, 101.
The pulse sequenced through every prime number between two and 101.
Who are we gonna call now?
Everybody.
MAN 1 [ON TV]: The rumors are flying, the implications extraordinary.
This morning's detection of an unidentified radio source from deep space...
...can neither be confirmed nor denied.
But the military presence arriving...
MAN 2: Sources close to the VLA report that the planet has been contacted...
...by some form of intelligent being...
...living outside of our solar system.
Again, there is no confirmation...
...that the official IAU communiqué was sent from this government facility.
KITZ:
I want all of these people out of here.
Where's the girl?
Twenty-two stations worldwide now confirming the signal.
Vega is currently below our horizon...
...so what you're hearing is the signal from-
Get decryption people in here now.
Lunacharsky is visiting at Cal Tech.
Explain this to me.
If the source of the signal is so sophisticated, why the remedial math?
Exactly, why don't they speak English?
Maybe because 70 percent of the planet speaks other languages.
Mathematics is the only truly universal language.
It's no coincidence that they're using primes.
- I don't get it.
- Prime numbers.
That would be integers that are only divisible by themselves and one.
We think this may be a beacon, some kind of an announcement...
...to get our attention.
If it's attention you want, you got that.
One thing: Vega.
People have been looking at Vega for years with no results.
And now yesterday they start broadcasting primes. Why?
Well, it's hardly yesterday, because the signal has been transmitting for 26 years.
Dr. Arroway.
- Excuse me, who are you?
- Michael Kitz, National Security Advisor.
Let me first say that your...
Actually, first, could you ask the gentlemen with the firearms to wait outside?
This is supposed to be a civilian facility.
- Doctor, with all due respect to your...
- Excuse me.
Hey, hey, hey.
Hi, I'm so glad you're back.
Come on, I got something for you to hear.
Is this great?
- Who are all these people?
- I have no idea.
Sit down. And we could use some help with the spectrum analysis.
- Listen to that. I'll get on it.
- Headsets.
So I'll just come right to the point, shall I?
Your having sent this all over the world may constitute a breach of national security.
This isn't a person-to-person call.
You can't think that a civilization sending this would intend it just for Americans.
I'm saying you might have consulted us.
- The contents could be extremely sensitive.
- You want to classify prime numbers?
Mike, please. We're only in line with Vega so many hours a day.
The only way to monitor the signal is to get the cooperation of other stations.
If Dr. Arroway hadrt acted quickly, we could have lost key elements.
Okay, fine, they've got the primes.
If you're right about there being a more significant transmission...
Which will need help to receive and decode.
Doctor, do you understand that my job is to protect...?
KENT: Shh!
- What?
- Listen.
- I hear it.
- Hear what?
- Harmonic.
Bingo. I had Willie ask Rattan to retune to 8.9247 gigahertz.
There's a lot more here, folks.
- Fish, let's get on the negative sideband.
FISHER: I'm already on it.
KITZ: What is going on?
DRUMLIN: Another signal.
Another signal, look at that.
A second signal at double the frequency.
It looks like a...
Somebody get a TV monitor.
Patch the recording into the image processor.
- You want the new data?
- Yeah, the new frequency we just recorded.
David, explain this to me, please.
With the prime there's another signal.
Looks like a TV transmission.
WILLIE:
We're hot.
Do me a favor, go get the blinds.
There is a lot of glare.
You're patched in.
All right, it's definitely an image.
Let's try and stabilize it.
What do you make of that, Fish?
It's two different interlaced frames.
I'm framing one.
ELLIE: It's just noise.
FISHER: Trying frame two.
I've got an offset carrier here.
I think it's audio.
Plug it in, plug it in.
Center that segment.
FISHER:
Centering.
- Can you clean it up any more than that?
FISHER: I'm working on it.
What the hell...?
Try zooming out.
All right, freeze.
Reverse values.
Try zooming out again.
Rotate 90 degrees counterclock...
DRUMLIN:
My God.
[HITLER SPEAKING IN GERMAN
ON RADIO]
- Okay.
KENT: What's going on?
You're not gonna believe this.
Does anybody speak German?
"I declare the Games in Berlin...
...at the celebration...
...of the first Olympics of the new era has opened."
Get me the White House.
Twenty million people died defeating that son of a bitch...
...and he's our first ambassador to outer space?
- Actually...
- The broadcast from the '36 Olympics...
...was the first television transmission that went into space.
That they recorded it and sent it back is saying, "Hello, we heard you."
Or, "Sjeg Heil, you're our kind of people."
Wait. Hitler and his politics have nothing to do with this.
It's highly unlikely they would understand, and people need to understand...
The people are in very good hands,
Dr. Arroway.
We'll take it from here.
WOMAN [ON TV]:
The White House has just released...
Smile, folks. We're on.
- A statement confirming a message from deep space...
...has been received by American scientists.
Claire Shipman is at the White House.
Donna, we've been told the president will have only a few remarks...
...about today's announcement...
...and that he won't be taking any questions from the press.
Good afternoon.
I'm glad to be joined by my science and technology advisor.
This is the product of years of exploration...
...by some of the world's most distinguished scientists.
Like all discoveries, this one will and should continue to be reviewed...
...examined and scrutinized.
It must be confirmed by other scientists.
The fact that something of this magnitude is being explored is another...
Fish, what is the story over here?
I thought Ellie was supposed to be on.
I don't know.
Guys? Guys? Um...
You know those interlaced frames that we thought were noise?
This has structure. I'm hearing structure.
If this discovery is confirmed...
...it will be one of the most stunning insights into our universe...
...that science has ever uncovered.
Its implications are as far-reaching and awe-inspiring as can be imagined.
Even as it promises answers to some of our oldest questions...
...it poses still others, even more fundamental.
We will continue to listen closely to what it has to say...
...as we continue the search for answers and for knowledge...
...that is as old as humanity itself but essential to our people's future.
- Thank you.
MAN: Sir...
Is there a considerable global security threat?
I'll answer your questions at the end, but first a few corrections.
The message was received Friday morning,
6:31 a.m. Mountain Standard Time.
It was largely mathematical, and in spite of reports you may have seen to the contrary...
...appears to be completely benign in nature.
Let me say that again.
The message is completely benign.
The president has been in touch with heads of state from around the world...
...and every possible security measure is being taken.
To better explain to you the events of the last 48 hours...
...l'm turning you over to the leader of the team that made this remarkable discovery...
...Dr. David Drumlin, special science advisor to the president.
Thank you, Rachel. Hello.
In 1936 a very faint television signal...
...transmitted the opening ceremonies of the Olympic Games...
...as a show of German superior technology.
That signal left Earth at the speed of light...
[PHONE RINGING]
...and 26 years later arrived in the vicinity of the star we call Vega.
That signal has been sent back to us hugely amplified...
...an unmistakable sign of intelligence.
ELLIE:
You're online, Kent, go ahead.
KENT: The Adolf transmission used 25 frames per second but we're receiving 50.
So we canned the other 25 through a series of search algorithms.
We found a series of markers on the top of each frame.
- Are you ready?
- Yeah, go ahead.
- Send it, Willie.
WILLIE: Okay, here it comes.
KENT:
It's digital...
...massive amounts of data which extend right to the higher harmonics.
Jackpot.
ELLIE:
All right, as you'll see...
...interlaced with the frames of the original Hitler image...
...we found these sections.
Now, we thought they were just noise, but they're actually data...
...huge amounts of it.
When we combine this with the data from the amplification of the original signal...
...we get these encrypted pages of text.
Now, no two are alike and we've uncovered over 10,000 already.
What does it mean, doctor?
Well, we have no idea.
It could be anything.
It could be the first volume of an Encyclopedia Galactica.
Instructions to acquaint us with their colonization procedures.
Moses with a few billion new commandments.
How long will it take to decode it?
It could take forever.
We really need a primer...
We need to get the best decryption people we have.
I intend to use the VLA as my command post.
In the meantime, my office has made out a preliminary budget.
Wait a minute.
This is a privately-funded operation.
We're only leasing dish time from the government...
If there's a more clear case of eminent domain, I've never seen it.
I'm going to recommend we militarize this project.
What? This is my project.
Nobody knows more about these scenarios than I do. David, tell them...
Excuse me, could we calm down here?
Now, I'm going to recommend that
Dr. Drumlin coordinate the decryption effort.
However, in light of Dr. Arroway's long experience in these matters...
...for the time being, she will continue to direct operations at the VLA...
...understanding that future discoveries will be kept in strictest confidence...
...until such time as the president...
...can decide the most suitable course of action. Understood?
Yes.
MAN:
This is CNN Breaking News.
The president made a statement, calling the message from Vega...
...one of the most stunning insights into our...
Attendance at religious services has risen a dramatic 39 percent in recent days.
...as police in three German divisions clashed with neo-Nazi protesters.
So it turns out there's life on other planets.
Boy, this is really gonna change the Miss Universe contest.
Health officials from around the world are concerned that the message from Vega...
...might trigger a rash of mass suicides...
...not unlike the recent cult deaths near San Diego...
Even a scientist has to admit...
...that there are some pretty serious religious overtones to all this.
Let's hear from someone whose organization...
...has been accused of conducting its own inquisition:
Richard Rank, head of the Conservative coalition.
Thank you.
This is yet another example of science intruding into matters of faith.
This means they have been reacting to TV signals...
...they got from the 1930s.
They're just getting them.
Imagine how disappointed they're gonna be if they're Cubs fans.
We now take you to Jeremy Roth, who is reporting on events...
...at the Very Large Array near Socorro, New Mexico.
Like a bolt from the blue it came.
The message from Vega has caused thousands of believers and non-believers...
...to descend upon the VLA facility here in the desert of New Mexico.
Many have come to protest, many to pray...
...but most have come to participate in what has become the best show in town.
[CHATTERING]
[CHANTING]
That's right. I'll be there in Vega, thank you very much.
CHORUS [SINGING]: Hajl to Vega
Hail to Vega, Hail to Vega
Hail to Vega
But they have failed!
It's the same people who, again and again...
...have brought us to the brink of destruction.
Who've polluted our air, who've poisoned our water.
Now these scientists...
...have had their chance.
Are these the kind of people...
...that you want talking to your God for you?
[PEOPLE YELLING INDISTINCTLY]
MAN [ON TV]:
Efforts continue around the clock.
But for now, almost 2 full weeks after the message's arrival...
...scientists here at the VLA still have no answers...
...only more questions.
Jeremy Roth, CNN,
Soccorro, New Mexico.
More on the quest for the message's meaning, after this.
They gotta line up somehow.
Yeah, well, this one doesn't fit, either.
We've tried over a million permutations.
Always, I can only get three corners to fit.
I don't understand their significance.
What...? Somebody broke in...
[PHONE RINGS]
Hello?
Hey, listen, I don't know who you are, but you broke into the database...
What? Now?
Where?
[FAX MACHINE HUMMING]
I'll be there.
MAN 1:
You should feel fortunate.
He hardly lands for anyone.
MAN 2:
Dr. Arroway...
...I presume?
Mr. Hadden.
I've had my eye on you a long time, doctor.
I consider you one of my most valuable long-term investments.
And when it comes to my investments...
...I always do my homework.
Eleanor Ann Arroway...
...born 25th August, 1964...
...De Pere, Wisconsin.
Mother, Joanna, died from complications during childbirth.
Early testing indicated high predisposition...
...towards science and mathematics.
Father, Theodore...
...advised to provide enrichment activities along these lines...
...did so conscientiously until his death...
...from myocardial infarction,
November 10, 1974.
You graduated from high school in 1979...
...almost two full years early.
Awarded full scholarship, M.I. T, graduated magna cum laude.
Doctoral work, Cal Tech...
...where you did breakthrough work on the lanthanide-doped ruby maser...
...dramatically increasing the sensitivity of radio telescopes.
Subsequently offered a teaching position at Harvard University...
...which you turned down to pursue SETI work...
...at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico.
Changes in NSF policy gave rise to certain funding problems...
...at which point you came to my attention.
You compromised our security codes.
Once upon a time...
...I was a hell of an engineer.
Please, sit, doctor.
I have guests so rarely, it's important to me that they feel welcome in my home.
You live here?
I find it convenient to keep my interests...
...mobile.
Anyway, I've had my fill of life on the ground.
Well, I... I guess I should...
Well, I guess I should thank you for having bailed me out all that time.
I know a good bet when I see one.
Earl Grey. No sugar, no milk, I believe.
What am I doing here?
[CHUCKLES]
The powers that be have been very busy lately...
...falling over each other to position themselves for the game of the millennium.
Maybe I can help deal you back in.
I didn't realize that I was out.
No, maybe not out...
...but certainly being handed your hat.
I've had a long time to make enemies, doctor.
And there are many governments, business interests...
...even religious leaders that would like to see me depart this earth.
And I'll grant them their wish soon enough.
But before I do,
I wish to make a small contribution.
A final gesture of goodwill to the people of this little planet that have given...
From whom I have taken so much.
You found the primer.
Clever girl.
Lights.
Pages and pages of data.
Over 63,000 in all.
And on the perimeter of each...
Alignment symbols, a registration mark, but they don't line up.
They do, if you think like a Vegan.
An alien intelligence has got be more advanced...
...and that means efficiency functioning on multiple levels...
...and in multiple dimensions.
Yes, of course!
Where's the primer?
You'll see.
Every three-dimensional page contains a piece of the primer.
There it was all the time, staring you in the face.
Buried within the message itself is the key to decoding it.
Within the layering of the matrix, we have these basic equations:
So with this very elementary foundation, they have given us a kind of...
...general scientific vocabulary.
We now have the symbols for true and false...
This was the key...
...that allowed us to decipher their language...
...for physics, geometry, chemistry.
Next frame, Ellie.
Yes, and when we apply this to the rest of the message...
...we find this.
Those look like engineering schematics, almost like blueprints.
Yeah.
Yes.
It is our belief that the message contains instructions...
...for building something, some kind of machine.
A machine? That does what, doctor?
We don't know.
It might be some type...
...of advanced communication device, or a teaching machine of some kind.
Or it might turn out to be some kind of a transport.
- Transport?
- There's no proof of that.
The fact is, you don't know what it does.
It could be anything.
Could be a Trojan horse. We build it and out pours the entire Vegan army.
Why bother risking the personnel?
It could be a weapon.
Right. Some kind of a doomsday machine.
Exactly. Every time they detect a new civilization...
...they fax these construction documents from space.
We poor saps build whatever this is and blow ourselves to kingdom come.
There's no reason to believe that their intentions are hostile.
Why is the default position of the egghead set that aliens would always be benign?
- Why is that, doctor?
- We pose no threat to them.
It would be like us going out of our way to destroy microbes on an anthill in Africa
DRUMLIN:
That's an interesting analogy.
And how guilty would we feel if we destroyed a few microbes on an anthill?
I hope you're right, doctor. I really do.
But right now my job is to protect
American lives from any threat.
In that regard, I am obligated to assume the worst.
Well, yes, and I am forced to agree with you.
My problem is this:
The content of that message is morally ambiguous at best.
Now, our internal numbers show support for this is incredibly soft.
If the president wishes to stay this course...
...you're gonna find his numbers going south like a duck.
- This is nuts.
RANK: Excuse me...
...miss.
We know nothing of these creatures' values.
The fact is, we don't even know whether they believe in God.
- This doesn't make any sense. If you...
CONSTANTINE: Excuse me, Dr. Arroway.
We won't be suppressing any opinions here today.
No, of course not. I understand.
What I meant to say...
...is the message was written in the language of science.
Now, if it had been religious in nature, it should have taken the form...
...of a burning bush or a booming voice from the sky.
But a voice from the sky...
...is exactly what you found,
Doctor Arroway.
I'm sorry I'm late, ma'am.
Now, I agree with Mr. Rank that there are unavoidable...
...religious implications at stake here.
But that doesn't justify taking an alarmist position.
My hope here is that we can find a common ground...
...break through any obstacles that may have kept us apart.
KITZ: Well, perhaps...
- Listen, I need to make one thing very clear.
Our organization will not be placated with flowery New Age rhetoric...
Mr. President.
The President met with his top advisors today...
...regarding the latest efforts to decode the message.
While there has been some progress, the official line remains a cautious one.
If you're asking when we'll find out what the purpose of that machine is...
...maybe tomorrow, maybe next year, maybe never.
There he is. The man with his finger on the spiritual pulse of the nation.
- It's so good to see you, Ellie.
- You too.
Your discovery, all of this.
It must be a real vindication.
I'm really happy for you.
- Are you?
- Mr. Joss, the president is waiting.
- Okay. Yeah.
- The president is waiting.
- Ellie, see you at the reception tonight?
- Yeah, I wouldn't miss it.
All right, great.
Excuse me, Miss Constantine, may I speak to you?
Certainly.
- I have a big problem.
- Yes?
Um...
Do you know where I can find, like, a really great dress?
[PEOPLE YELLING INDISTINCTLY]
God created man in the form of himself, not in the form of monkeys!
MAN 1: The Lord is God!
MAN 2: Praise God.
MAN 3: Praise the Lord!
MAN 4: You're wasting my tax dollars!
Get a job.
Don't waste my tax dollars.
You hear me?
Wow.
You look beautiful, Ellie.
- So do you.
- You really do.
I read your book.
Here we go.
Would you like me to quote you?
"Ironically, the thing that people are most hungry for, meaning...
...is the one thing that science hasn't been able to give them."
Yeah. Yeah.
Come on. It's like you're saying that science killed God.
What if science simply revealed...
...that he never existed in the first place?
- I think we're gonna need to get some air.
- What?
And a few more of these.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- A little chilly out here.
- Yeah, this is nice.
- I got one for you.
- What?
Occam's razor. Ever heard of it?
Hoccam's razor.
Sounds like some slasher movie.
No, Occam's Razor.
It's a basic scientific principle. It says...
...all things being equal, the simplest explanation tends to be the right one.
- Makes sense to me.
- All right.
- So, what's more likely? Thank you.
- You're welcome.
An all-powerful, mysterious God created the universe...
...and then decided not to give any proof of his existence?
Or that he simply doesn't exist at all and that we created him...
...so we wouldn't have to feel so small and alone.
I don't know.
I couldn't imagine living in a world where God didn't exist.
I wouldn't want to.
How do you know that you're not deluding yourself?
I mean, for me, I'd need proof.
Proof?
- Did you love your father?
- What?
Your dad, did you love him?
Yes. Very much.
Prove it.
[PHONE RINGS]
Kent.
[PAGER BEEPING]
- The White House.
- Mr. Joss.
DRUMLIN: I don't want excuses.
Whoever is responsible, I want their head.
- Ellie?
- What happened?
You were right all along.
The decryption team at the VLA has been working around the clock...
...and the hard work has finally paid off.
This key section, uncovered tonight and obtained exclusively by CNN...
...shows an illustration of what is of a human figure...
...inside a geometric structure of some kind.
This and other contextual clues...
...now lead scientists to believe that the message is, in fact...
- President called an emergency meeting.
- Yeah, I imagine he would.
- Designed to take a single human occupant into space...
...presumably to the star Vega.
MAN: I'm gonna miss my mother's birthday party.
KITZ: Call her in the morning, tell her why you didn't show up.
Tell me.
They're gonna build it.
Who gets to go?
The president's just gone international to spread the risk and cost...
Who gets to go, though?
Well, it's complicated, Ellie.
What?
They have formed a group of international candidates.
Now, it's your discovery.
Okay, they understand that.
You're at the top of a very short list.
But they're also putting together a selection committee.
It's made of scholars, theologians, scientists, philosophers...
You're on it.
I've been asked, yes.
I guess that means...
...that you're a selector,
I'm a selectee and we can't...
Yeah.
What you don't understand, Ellie, is...
- I understand.
- Ellie...
I want you to know, whatever happens, as far as I'm concerned...
Well...
...good luck.
Well, whatever you do, make sure he doesn't monopolize the committee.
He is not on the committee, Ellie.
What?
He just resigned as science advisor.
He wants to be the one to go.
MAN [ON TV]: The president is already beginning to feel the financial pinch.
Sources say the cost of the project...
...is spiraling to more than a third of a trillion dollars...
...making this what may be the most expensive single project...
...in all of human history.
Meanwhile, months of debate finally reached a conclusion last week...
...as 10 candidates were selected by the IMC...
...representing a cross section of political, philosophical and religious views.
Many of these are the same experts who have been consulting...
...on the Machine's design and function.
They will be actively participating on-site during the construction process.
But the choice of these 10 candidates has not been without controversy.
Fully one-third of the candidates are American.
Many international observers are asking why.
The U.S. Is shouldering an enormous percentage of the financial...
Isn't it true that the contractors, like Hadden Industries...
...are making those contributions in exchange for technology rights?
Different nations are being compensated in different ways. For example...
Japan made headlines when it announced it would forego candidate representation...
...in exchange for the systems integration subcontract.
On what basis do you choose a human being to represent humanity?
Good question, Larry.
Yes, well, if nothing else...
...it should be somebody who is fluent in the language the message was given in.
Science, in this case.
Doctor Arroway, despite your obvious enthusiasm...
...there's been a lot of criticism of late...
...that this whole endeavor is simply too dangerous.
Some of that criticism from scientists.
One Nobel Prize winner recently noted, his words:
"There is every indication...
...that this is simply beyond our capabilities, that this endeavor will fail...
...and that the Machine's occupant will pay for that failure with their life."
How do you respond to that?
ELLIE: Well, this message is from a civilization that may be anywhere...
...from hundreds to millions and millions of years ahead of us.
I have to believe that an intelligence that advanced...
...knows what they're doing.
Now all it requires on our part is...
Faith?
I was gonna say a sense of adventure.
MAN:
And in breaking news...
...a former astronaut...
...considered to be the leading American candidate for the Machine seat...
...has unexpectedly dropped out of the running.
Russell met with reporters this afternoon at his Houston home.
I told my dad that I didn't want him to go.
Daddy, don't go.
Nothing would give me more pride than to...
...represent my country.
But what can I say to this?
Consortium officials had no comment, but sources within the delegation...
...have disclosed that Dr. Arroway...
...appears to now be the front-runner for the Machine seat.
ELLIE:
"Meet me at noon. Must talk."
I didn't expect to be getting a message like this from you.
Thanks for coming.
So is this kosher?
Fraternizing with the enemy?
Selectors and selectees mingling around?
Can we talk about Einstein?
Yeah, sure. Okay.
- Special relativity.
- Yeah.
This machine...
...now, if it works, and you travel to Vega at even close to the speed of light...
...when you come back...
- If you come back.
If you come back...
...you'll only be 4 years older, but over
50 years would have passed here on Earth.
Basically, yeah.
And everybody that you care about...
...will be gone, dead and buried.
If you came back, if you survived at all, which...
Look, Palmer, nobody's saying this isn't dangerous, all right?
The rest of the candidates and myself, we fully understand the risks we're taking.
Why?
Because it's a historic opportunity.
The world needs...
No, you, Ellie. You. You personally.
By doing this, you're willing to give your life.
You're willing to die for it.
Why?
From as long as I can remember,
I've been searching for...
...something...
...some reason why we're here.
What are we doing here? Who are we?
If this is a chance to find out even just a little part of that answer...
I don't know,
I think it's won'th a human life.
Don't you?
You're an incredibly brave woman, Ellie.
Or incredibly nuts.
Palmer...
I'm really confused.
So am I.
I think I speak for us all when I thank you for your patience.
Myself, I have one final question,
Dr. Arroway.
If you should meet these Vegans...
...and were permitted only one question to ask of them...
...what would it be?
Well, I suppose it would be:
"How did you do it?
How did you evolve? How did you survive this technological adolescence...
...without destroying yourself?"
That more than any other question is one
I personally would like to have answered.
Not too bad, Mike.
PATEL:
I join Dr. Bergeron...
...in expressing thanks for your patience, Dr. Arroway.
We've all been most impressed with your candor...
...and your stamina.
I believe we are ready to move on to your final statement.
Madam Chairman,
I have one more question.
Yes, Mr. Joss.
Dr. Arroway...
Would you consider yourself...
...a spiritual person?
Uh...
I don't really understand the point of the question.
I consider myself a moral person.
PATEL:
I'm sure we all agree that is the case...
...but I think what Mr. Joss is in fact asking...
Do you believe in God...
...Dr. Arroway?
As a scientist...
...I rely on empirical evidence, and in this matter...
...I don't believe that there is data either way.
PATEL: So your answer would in fact be that you don't believe in God.
I don't understand the relevance of the question.
Dr. Arroway,
95 percent of the world's population...
...believes in a supreme being in one form or another.
I believe that makes the question more than relevant.
PATEL:
Dr. Arroway?
I believe, um...
I believe I've already answered that question.
I'm proud of what we've achieved as a species...
...and as a civilization.
I would hate to see everything we stand for...
...all that we have fought for for a thousand generations...
...all that God has blessed us with...
...betrayed...
...in the final hour because we chose to send a representative who did not put our...
...most cherished beliefs first.
Thank you.

Why did you do it?
Our job was to select someone to speak for everybody.
I just couldn't in good conscience vote for a person...
...who doesn't believe in God.
Someone who...
...honestly thinks the other 95 percent of us...
...suffer from some form of mass delusion.
I told the truth up there.
And Drumlin told you exactly what you wanted to hear.
DRUMLIN:
With full humility and utmost gratitude...
...I accept this great honor...
...and I promise I will do my best to represent my nation...
...my planet and my God on this historic journey.
I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
[APPLAUDING]
MAN [ON TV]: There's a carnival atmosphere at Cape Canaveral...
...as the International
Machine Consortium...
...hosts as much a media event as a systems test.
David Drumlin is supervising the on-site portion of the test.
We spoke with him earlier today.
DRUMLIN: We'll be able to monjtor the stresses and effects...
...using the robot passenger...
...who we lovingly call Elmer.
WOMAN [OVER SPEAKER]: We are coming up on T-minus two hours and counting.
All Machine systems are go.
Dr. Arroway, the press would like to ask you a few questions...
...as soon as they're done with Dr. Drumlin.
DRUMLIN: Now, at the moment where we release the pod...
...there will be a substantial amount of energy generated at the core.
We'll be able to monitor the stresses and effects...
...using our robot passenger, who we lovingly call Elmer.
[CHUCKLES]
- Thank you.
- Welcome.
WOMAN:
- The test area is clear and go.
Sir, they're ready for you out at the site.
Yeah, just a minute.
WOMAN: The test director has issued a go to enter the final countdown phase.
Ellie.
- Congratulations, David.
- Glad you could come.
Didrt, uh, expect to see you here.
Well, I'm still, you know,
Crew Ops at the Control Center.
And I suppose the fact that I discovered the message means that I have PR value.
Of course.
Ellie, I know you must think this is all very unfair.
And maybe that's an understatement.
What you don't know is, I agree.
I wish the world was a place where fair was the bottom line.
Where the kind of idealism you showed at the hearing was rewarded...
...not taken advantage of.
Unfortunately, we don't live in that world.
Funny...
...I always believed that the world is what we make of it.
Excuse me, Dr. Drumlin, sir?
Good luck on the test.
- The pad leader has issued the order...
- Thank you.
...to clear the pad of all nonessential...
- Right this way, sir.
Test director, everything looks good up here. We're ready to go.
STEVE: All right, people, I want things double and triple checked here.
We only get one shot at this.
Let's get it right.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are ready for startup.
All controllers, I need a go-no-go for test initiation.
- Mechanical?
MAN 1: Go.
- Electrical?
MAN 2: Go.
- Dynamics?
MAN 3: Go.
- Communications?
MAN 4: Go.
- Pod systems?
WOMAN: Go
- Safety?
MAN 5: Go.
Crew Ops, verify all pre-test procedures are complete.
Yes, verified. I'm go.
Pad leader, we are good.
Is everything okay with you?
Roger. The pad is a go.
STEVE:
Test initiation, on my mark.
Five...
...four...
...three...
...two...
...one.
Mark.
MAN 1: Test start.
MAN 2: Rings are unlocked.
MAN 3:
Power levels indicate a good start.
WOMAN 1: We have begun the full-scale test of Earth's first system...
...built by the sharing of knowledge with a neighbor in our universe.
MAN 4:
All power sources on core induction bus.
WOMAN 2:
IPV power transfer.
GERRY: Ring motion detect.
Alpha, Bravo, Charlie.
STEVE: Gerry, how are we looking?
GERRY: Looks good. We're underway.
DRUMLIN:
Looks like we have a normal startup.
STEVE:
Roger, David. It's looking good here.
[CHEERING]
WOMAN 1: We are moments away from the initiation of the drop sequence.
All systems are go.
STEVE: Mechanical, you still happy?
MAN 1: Roger that.
DRUMLIN: I'll tell you, this is very exciting from up here.
GERRY: We've got 4 percent.
DRUMLIN: We're confirming 4 percent.
Frequency 9.85.
Harmonics in the green. G-level 1.1.
- Five percent.
- Confirmed. We are at 5 percent.
David, how's it looking to you?
DRUMLIN: Okay. I'm gonna take a look and show you what we got.
MAN 2: All test-subject instrumentation looks good.
Confirmed, we have a good picture from Dr. Drumlirs PRD.
DRUMLIN: Hope you guys are seeing what I'm seeing.
MAN 3:
All systems are go.
DRUMLIN:
This is really something.
MAN 4:
For purposes of this test...
...Dr. Drumlin will be on top of the gantry crane that's over the Machine.
We've got some video animation...
...to show you just how this machine, it is thought, will work.
The passenger pod will be released.
It will come down through the center of the rings and into the Machine's core.
The big question everyone here is asking is, of course, what happens then?
Some believe that the rings function as some sort of an accelerator or something...
...sending its energy into this passenger pod...
...making it rocket away at near the speed of light.
Other people believe it might open up a doorway to some other dimension.
Who's right?
Well, that's what today's test is all about.
GERRY: Thirty-five percent.
MAN 1: Subsystems, are you ready?
GERRY: Forty percent normal acceleration.
MAN 2: Roger, confirm 40 percent.
STEVE: All controllers stand by to initiate drop sequence...
...on my mark.
MAN 3:
All systems ready for drop sequence.
GERRY:
Forty-five percent.
DRUMLIN:
We're reading 45 percent.
Can you verify closure?
GERRY:
Forty-six.
STEVE: All controllers stand by to initiate IPV drop sequence. On my mark.
GERRY:
Forty-eight percent.
DRUMLIN: Test djrector,
I'm feeling a very strange vibration.
Are you feeling it down there?
STEVE:
Gerry, can you confirm any vibration?
GERRY:
Negative, everything looks good here.
- Crew Ops?
- Nothing wrong with Elmer.
We're not seeing anything abnormal.
DRUMLIN: No good. Hold the sequence.
I'm gonna take a direct reading.
STEVE: What the hell is he talking about?
- Can anyone say grandstanding?
He sure knows he's on TV!
Back home that's what we call an overcooked ham.
DRUMLIN:
I'm reading 10 kilohertz!
What's your reading on the first and second order G-levels?
MAN 1:
G-levels are right on.
MAN 2: We confirm Drumlirs readings and they're all normal. We're go.
STEVE:
Copy that, Dynamics.
I think we're okay, but we'll let him finish.
- Mechanical, you still okay?
MAN 3: Roger, chief.
We're right on the money.
We've got a security problem here.
Ellie, are you sure?
Yeah. This guy, he shouldn't be there.
I know him.
Gerry, execute the rapid shutdown sequence.
Security, move emergency response team into position one.
- Get me Drumlin on a secure loop, please.
- You got him.
- David, can you hear me?
DRUMLIN: Yes, I hear.
ELLIE: All right, we've got a security breach here.
Right behind you. The tall guy.
The technician. See him?
He's not supposed to be there.
David, he's got something in his hand!
Him! Take him! Security breach!
He's got a bomb!
STEVE: I want that emergency-response team up on the gantry now.
Security, stage one alert.
By God, move all the fire and rescue personnel into position one.
[YELLING]
[SCREAMING]
STEVE:
All right, all right, back to your stations.
I need you to be professional, people.
Settle down.
Pad leader, pad leader, do you copy?
The scene earlier today, when David Drumlin...
...advisor to two presidents...
...and winner of the National Academy of Sciences lifetime award...
...was laid to rest at Arlington National Cemetery.
In a related story, last night's raid...
Can I help you?
- Oh, you're... I've got some mail for you.
...resulted in the discovery of this video.
The suicide note of the leader of the terrorist group now believed responsible...
...for the explosion in Florida this week.
What we do, we do for the goodness of all mankind.
This won't be understood, not now...
...but the apocalypse to come...
...will vindicate our faith.
[PULSING]
Welcome home.
[MAN SPEAKING IN RUSSIAN
ON TV]
Oh, Comrade Arroway...
...he has been expecting your call.
One moment, please.
Mr. Hadden?
Doctor.
How kind of you to call.
Mr. Hadden, where are you?
The Russian government was kind enough to give me accommodations on Mir.
You're living on a space station?
It's quite simple, really.
The low-oxygen, zero-gravity environment...
...is the only thing keeping the cancer from eating me alive.
Actually, I quite like it up here.
My little room has one hell of a view.
I wanna show you something.
Hokkaido Island.
The systems integration site.
Look closer.
First rule in government spending:
Why build one when you can have two at twice the price?
Only, this one can be kept secret.
Controlled by Americans...
...built by the Japanese subcontractors...
...who also happen to be...
...recently acquired...
...wholly-owned subsidiaries...
...of Hadden Industries.
- Of Hadden Industries.
They still want an American to go, doctor.
Wanna take a ride?
WOMAN: And augmenting our restraint and communications console subsystem...
...we have your personal recording unit.
Normal, infrared and ultraviolet lenses.
Digital microchip good for thousands of hours of recording.
Okay, look, I understand...
...the reason for recording and documenting the mission.
But I just... I wanna go on record one more time.
The transmitted specs never said anything about any chair...
...or a restraining harness or survival gear.
Why can't we just trust the original...?
Doctor, both the IMC Board and the SI team reviewed the matter...
...and concluded that the design impact is negligible.
Bottom line is...
...we're not putting anybody aboard this machine...
...unless there is some sort of minimal protection.
End of story.
- Okay.
MAN: Ellie...
...we've been giving these to the astronauts since the beginning of the space program.
It's never been made public, of course.
It's fast and it's painless.
I'm gonna travel 26 light years to commit suicide?
Something may go wrong.
There may be an unforeseen mechanical failure.
You could be marooned, unable to return.
There are a thousand reasons we can think of for you to have this...
...but mostly it's for the reasons we can't think of.
[KNOCKING]
Come in.
- Dr. Arroway, time to get ready.
- Thank you.
I know you don't have much time.
As soon as I found out about the Machine,
I called the president.
I came with Kitz.
I had to see you one more time.
- Oh, God, I'm sorry.
- It's okay.
No, I'm glad you came.
There's something I gotta say to you.
The reason I didn't vote for you to go was a good reason, but it wasrt the real one.
I didn't vote for you to go...
...because I don't wanna lose you.
You find your way home, all right?
Twenty-three hours ago...
...the world was stunned by the announcement of a second Machine...
...and its passenger,
Eleanor Ann Arroway.
Now the question that's on everyone's mind:
Will history repeat itself?
With a piece of engineering this complex...
...with so many unknowns, could the unthinkable occur?
The security in Hokkaido has been incredibly tight.
No reporters whatsoever have been allowed near the site.
Thanks.
Magnetic restraint is secure.
All life support functions normal.
Roger that. Ellie, this is Control.
Do you copy?
Ellie to Control, reading you five-by-five.
- Comm 1, Give me Ellie's PRD.
- Video unit recording and transmitting.
- Are you reading me?
STEVE: That's affirmative.
Video looks good.
- Copy that, Control.
- Okay.
Ellie, we're gonna proceed to button you up.
Roger, Control. I'm ready.
- Dynamics...
- I can confirm the walkway retraction.
STEVE: Systems?
MAN 1: Go.
STEVE: Communications?
MAN 2: Go.
STEVE: Life support?
WOMAN: Go.
Ellie, we are go for closure.
I'm go here.
STEVE: Mechanical, initiate
IPV closure sequence.
Hold on, let me get you a chair.
ELLIE:
I'm go.
- It's nice to smell you again, Mr. Kitz.
- You too.
Wouldrt peg him as a Polo man.
I got a visual on the door.
WOMAN:
IPV escape system is armed.
Door is looking good.
Door alignment looks good.
Ellie, we are showing green across the board.
Copy that, Control. IPV is secure.
GERRY:
We are at 30 percent.
Copy that, 30 percent.
- How you doing in there, EI?
- Kent?
- Is that you?
- That's a big affirmative.
Who let you in there, huh?
A higher power intervened.
Well, I'm glad you came.
GERRY:
Thirty-five percent.
Copy that, 35 percent.
- Mechanical?
- We're good.
Forty percent.
I'm picking up a moderate vibration here.
- Dynamics, can you confirm vibration?
GERRY: Everything looks good here.
She's feeling the same thing they felt at the Cape at this point.
Ellie, the vibration is normal.
GERRY: We are at 50 percent.
All systems nominal.
Copy that, 50 percent.
Vibration is getting a little stronger now.
We're picking up some low-frequency noise.
- Mechanical, can you confirm?
- It looks fine to me.
STEVE: Roger. Gerry, what do you think?
- I'm still go.
People, we are still go.
What...? Something's happening.
I'm... There's...
There's a light. Do you see that?
I'm seeing some...
Something, some...
I can't tell whether it's daylight or not.
There it is again.
It's coming from the bottom.
Here, let me show you. See that?
Negative. Ellie, you're breaking up.
- Comm 1, can we boost her signal?
- Already at maximum.
GERRY:
Sixty-five percent.
The material is changing.
It's bordering on translucence.
But the system is intact.
It's gotta be some kind of electromagnetic field.
- Are you reading this?
- Negative, we're seeing only interference.
It's becoming completely translucent.
I can't describe it. I can't even explain it.
Seventy percent.
People, we have intermittent comm, but we are go.
- Initiate secondary drive systems.
GERRY: Initiating auxiliary booster sequence.
MAN:
We're go for ignition.
We have auxiliary booster ignition.
Life support, how is she doing?
We still have data. Heart and respiration are high but within limits.
Ellie, do you copy?
If you could hear, I am okay to go.
If you could hear me...
Eighty percent.
All vibration and G-levels are in the green.
Control, if you're reading me...
...I am okay to go. Okay to go,
GERRY: Eighty-five percent.
MAN: All bearing tips are on the profile.
Ninety percent. We're detecting some structural instability.
- Confirmed. Is she holding?
- We're within limits, barely.
I'm okay to go.
My God!
Okay to go. I'm okay.
Hundred percent target velocity.
MAN:
Steve?
Tremendous EMI levels around the Machine.
All field measurements are off-scale.
Steve, we're approaching our abort limits.
Okay to go.
I hear her!
I hear her. Barely, but she's there.
- Okay to go.
- She says she's okay to go.
Steve, we're real close.
- Electrical, reading in the core?
MAN: Internal environment normal.
Inside the core, the weather's beautiful.
I'm okay to go.
Okay to go. I'm okay to go.
STEVE:
Initiate drop sequence.
On my mark.
Ten, nine...
...eight...
...seven, six...
...five, four...
...three, two...
I'm okay to go.
Oh, God!
Ellie to Control.
Ellie to Control, do you read me?
I'm gonna try to keep recording.
I'm going through some kind of a tunnel.
There's a light source ahead.
Brilliant and blue-white.
Residual radiation?
It's a star.
I must have gone through a wormhole.
It's Vega.
I'm in another wormhole now.
I had no idea.
A series of them.
They're alive.
It's like some kind of a transit system.
It's a subway.
[YELLS]
Okay.
Okay, I've gotta keep talking.
It's a triple... No, quadruple system.
It's beautiful.
They're alive.
Another wormhole!
This one is much more violent!
Some...
...celestial event...
No...
No words. No words...
...to describe it.
Poetry.
They should have sent a poet.
It's so beautiful.
Beautiful.
So beautiful.
I had no idea.
I had no...
I had no idea.
I had no idea. I had no idea.
Hi, Sparks.
Dad?
I missed you.
Arert you...?
I'm sorry I couldn't be there for you, sweetheart.
You're not real.
None of this is real.
That's my scientist.
When I was unconscious, you downloaded my thoughts, my memory even.
Pensacola.
We thought this might make things easier for you.
- Why did you contact us?
- You contacted us.
We were just listening.
And there are others?
Many others.
They all...
...travel here through that transit system that you built?
We didn't build it.
We don't know who did.
No, they were gone long before we ever got here.
Maybe someday they'll come back.
All the other civilizations that you find, they come here?
Not all.
- Is this some test?
- No, no tests.
You have your mother's hands.
You're an interesting species...
...an interesting mix.
You're capable of such beautiful dreams...
...and such horrible nightmares.
You feel so lost...
...so cut off, so alone.
Only you're not.
See...
In all our searching...
...the only thing we've found that makes the emptiness bearable...
...is each other.
What happens now?
Now?
You go home.
ELLIE:
Home?
But I have so many questions.
Do we get to come back?
This was just a first step.
In time, you'll take another.
But other people need to see what I've seen...
This is the way it's been done for billions of years.
- But I...
- Small moves, Ellie.
Small moves.
We've got video on Ellie.
Five-by-five.
STEVE:
She's through! She is in the net.
She's alive. Get the White House.
Get the president on the phone.
What's going on, Steve? How is she?
How is she?
STEVE:
Ellie, this is Control. Do you copy?
KENT: What's going on?
- I don't know. Hang on.
- She is alive.
STEVE: Put her on the PA.
Ellie, just hold on tight.
We're still trying to determine the nature of the malfunction...
...but the important thing is you're okay.
What?
It's all right, Ellie.
The important thing is that you're safe.
What malfunction?
What...?
What happened?
What day is this?
I'm sorry, Ellie, did you say what day?
How long was I gone?
Ellie, the IPV dropped straight through the Machine.
You didn't go anywhere.
But I did. I did go.
That's what I've been trying to tell everyone.
But the headset didn't record a single image?
Just this. Static.
Thank you.
Now, doctor, let me show you what we saw.
Forty-three separate remote cameras show exactly the same event.
The IPV dropped straight through.
Everyone who watched saw exactly the same thing.
Nothing happened.
How do you explain this, doctor?
I can't.
CLINTON:
I would encourage you...
...not to inflame this situation beyond the facts.
Let us deal with this on the facts.
We are monitoring what has actually happened.
We are taking what we believe is factually appropriate steps.
Amid a flurry of accusations and counter-accusations...
...by the nations representing the Machine Consortium...
...the president has ordered a special inquiry.
However, the appointment to the committee of Michael Kitz...
...who has recently resigned as National Security Advisor...
...has raised a number of eyebrows on Capitol Hill.
I have made no decision to run for
Congress, I have announced no candidacy.
The fact that I resigned as National Security Advisor...
...has nothing to do with anything...
...other than I want to devote all of my energy to this inquiry.
The people of the world have a right to know what really happened.
And yet every scientific instrument confirms...
...the IPV was out of contact for only a fraction of a second.
Isn't that correct, doctor?
A fraction of a second Earth time, yes.
SENATOR:
Earth time?
ELLIE: Senator, I believe that the Machine opened up a wormhole...
...a tunnel through the fabric of space-time, also known as an Einstein-Rosen Bridge.
Now, because of the effects of general relativity, what I experienced as 18 hours...
...passed instantaneously on Earth.
Isn't it true that these wormholes you speak of are merely theoretical predictions?
There is no evidence they actually exist, is there?
ELLIE:
There is no direct evidence, no.
KITZ:
Tell me something, doctor...
...why do you think these aliens would go to all this trouble?
Bring you tens of thousands of light years and then send you home without proof?
They said that's how it's been done for billions of years.
KITZ: That's very neat. You have no proof because they didn't want you to have any.
A phenomenon known in psychiatric circles,
I believe, as a self-reinforcing delusion.
Is that what you think? Delusional?
KITZ: Well, I do think you may have suffered some kind of an episode. Yeah, I do.
Doctor, I'd like to propose an alternate hypothesis...
...and I'd like you to bring your scientific expertise to bear on it.
To fake a signal from Vega...
...what would you need?
You would need a satellite to transmit the signal, but it would be impossible to...
You'd need a satellite and need launch capabilities to put the satellite into orbit.
And the message itself.
To put something like this together...
...so complex, drawing on many disciplines...
- Would be impossible.
KITZ: Impossible?
Impossible?
Is there anyone who might have been up to the challenge?
Someone with extraordinary technical expertise...
...enormous financial resources...
...someone perverse enough, eccentric enough to come up with the idea?
Hadden?
S. R. Hadden.
[CROWD MURMURING]
You're implying that this was all some kind of a hoax?
That he engineered this?
KITZ:
S. R. Hadden...
...a legendary power broker and manipulator in perhaps his final bid for immortality.
Maybe he wanted to explore and exploit new technologies...
...and get the governments to pick up the tab.
Perhaps this was his final altruistic gesture...
...to unite the world in some common goal.
Maybe all of the above.
S. R. Hadden, a brilliant and complicated man.
Doctor, are you familiar with the scientific precept...
...known as Occam's razor?
ELLIE:
Yes.
It means that all things being equal...
...the simplest explanation tends to be the right one.
KITZ:
Exactly.
Now, you tell me.
What is more likely here?
That a message from aliens results in a magical machine...
...that whisks you away to the center of the galaxy...
...to go windsurfing with your dad and a split second later...
...returns you home without a single shred of proof?
Or that your experience is the result of being...
...the unwitting star in the farewell performance of one S.R. Hadden?
A man with the means, motive and opportunity to play you and the rest of us...
...as pawns in the biggest, most elaborate, most expensive hoax of all time?
MAN:
Dr. Arroway.
You come to us with no evidence, no record...
...no artifacts.
Only a story that, to put it mildly, strains credibility.
Over half a trillion dollars were spent.
Dozens of lives were lost.
Are you really gonna sit there and tell us we should just take this all...
...on faith?
KITZ:
Please answer the question, doctor.
Is it possible that it didn't happen?
Yes.
[CROWD MURMURING]
As a scientist I must concede that.
I must volunteer that.
KITZ:
Wait a minute, let me get this straight.
You admit you have absolutely no physical evidence to back up your story?
Yes.
You admit that you very well may have hallucinated this whole thing?
- Yes.
- You admit that if you were in our position...
...you would respond with exactly the same degree of incredulity and skepticism?
Yes.
Then why don't you simply withdraw your testimony and concede...
...that this journey to the center of the galaxy in fact never took place?
Because I can't.
[CROWD MURMURING]
I had an experience.
I can't prove it. I can't even explain it.
But everything that I know as a human being, everything I am...
...tells me it was real.
I was given something wonderful, something that changed me forever.
A vision...
...of the universe...
...that tells us undeniably...
...how tiny and insignificant...
...and how rare and precious we all are.
A vision that tells us that we belong to something...
...that is greater than ourselves, that we are not... That none of us are alone.
I wish I could share that.
I wish...
...that everyone, if even for one moment...
...could feel that awe and humility and hope.
But...
That continues to be my wish.
MAN 1: Dr. Arroway, get a picture, please?
Get a photo over here?
WOMAN:
Here comes Ellie.
MAN 2:
Reverend Joss! Reverend Joss!
MAN 3: Reverend Joss, what do you believe? What do you believe?
As a person of faith, I'm bound by a different covenant than Dr. Arroway.
But our goal is one and the same.
The pursuit of truth.
I, for one, believe her.
So, what happens now?
We give her a medal?
I'd say at least a healthy grant.
I assume you read the confidential report from the investigating committee?
KITZ:
I flipped through it.
I was especially interested in the section on Arroway's video unit.
The one that recorded the static.
Continue.
The fact that it recorded static isn't what interests me.
Continue.
What interests me...
...is that it recorded approximately 18 hours of it.
That is interesting, isn't it?
ELLIE: You can see over there, we're building 45 brand-new dishes.
And that means when you put them together with all the radio telescopes...
...all over the world...
...then we get to hear farther into space than anybody has ever heard before.
Yeah.
Are there other people out there in the universe?
That's a good question.
What do you think, huh?
- I don't know.
- That's a good answer.
Skeptic, huh?
The important thing is that you all keep searching for your own answers.
I'll tell you one thing about the universe, though.
The universe is a pretty big place.
It's bigger than anything anyone has ever dreamed of before.
So if it's just us...
...it seems like an awful waste of space.
Right?
Timms, they've got to understand.
My treatments are making him smarter... at an incredible rate.
It's more important than training him for war.
You know our funding comes from The Shop.
They want this animal trained in virtual reality... to use the infrared battle helmet, not recite the ABCs.
I won't increase the dosage of aggression drugs.
He's already been exhibiting behavioral instability... in the virtual battle simulations.
What you're suggesting could destroy his mind.
There is no choice, Larry.
They don't care about his intelligence enhancement.
They want his primal rage centers fully stimulated.
He is to be battlefield ready.
Fucking screw the political assholes.
He's the best chimp
I've ever had.
Battlefield simulation engaged.

We have no visual indication... that any incoming artillery have arrived... or, indeed, are on the way.
We can report the air raid sirens are going off.
The military has been silent, though a couple of hours ago... we heard a huge noise... and it was confirmed that four KC-1...
KC-135 supertankers had left the area.
These are the planes that refuel... other fighter planes and bombers...
American bomber planes over the area... so they're in the air.
I'm trying to sleep, Larry.
I had a bad nightmare.
Really bad.
God, I hate it when you smoke in bed.
Oh, Jesus.
What did you do that for?
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Larry, what are you doing?
Answer the phone.
Yeah? Hello?
Larry, it's Timms.
Your chimp's dead.
It tried to escape.
When?
It wasn't a robot we were building, Timms.
It was a living organism.
As the project supervisor and the government liaison... it was my responsibility... to use the strongest measures available.
Listen, I've warned you about the aggression factors.
He just ran the program we embedded.
Five years of research down the drain.
We'll get you another chimp.
That chimp was the key to moving on to a human subject.
Come in.
We'll talk about it.
I've had it.
I want to make something better than a military weapon.
I'll just find funding in the private sector, that's all.
You're not thinking straight, Larry.
You signed ironclad nondisclosures.
VSI owns it all.
Besides, it might not be the healthiest thing to try.
You're talking about The Shop?
The puppet masters who pull all the strings?
What, they own me?
They'll rub me out...
The Shop... if I don't comply?
You're being paranoid.
Your intelligence enhancement work was brilliant.
No one's saying stop.
I am.
Larry, relax.
I know you're upset because of what happened with the chimp.
Relax? They want to suppress my work!
The potentials for human advancement are endless!
Virtual reality holds a key to the evolution of the mind... and that's my focus.
This is something... and we haven't had something for a while.
There will be time for all this, Larry.
You just have to play the game a little longer.
That is how everything finally gets done in this world.
Why don't you take a hiatus and we'll restructure around here?
You can use the rest.
Take a hiatus.
Another hot one.
It's going to be a killer.
It's a long way up here.
Jobe!
Jobe, lad!
Ah, Jobe!
I feel like you live in the top of a tree.
Come on, boy. Let's go.
Grass is waiting for you.
Oh, no.
Did me brother have you doing penance all night again?
What did you do?
Nothing.
OK, well...
It's OK, Jobe boy.
It's OK. It's me, Terry.
Come on. Here.
Go get a shirt on, then we'll go, OK?
What have we got here?
Well...
Oh, no.
Oh, my God, would you look at this?
You finished Big Red.
Yeah.
Aye, you're magic with a machine, boy.
Look at this.
Could we try it... try it today, Terry?
I don't see why not.
Go fill up the gas can, Jobe.
Get me a candy bar.
Hey, Pop, could you move that shit before Christmas?
Fill her up.
Hey, Jake, that's dangerous.
You forget who you're talking to, half-wit?
That's dangerous.
Jobe, boy, go ahead and finish what you're doing.
He's smoking, Terry.
That's right. I'm smoking.
Why don't you shut the fuck up and fill your gas tank?
Jake, he don't mean no harm.
One of these fucking...
Jake, how's your old man doing?
Worse than ever!
Angelo is like all brilliant types... erratic.
But we tolerate them at The Shop as long as they perform... and Angelo has certainly done that.
Project Five is very impressive.
Mr. Director, without Angelo, there is no Project Five.
Well, he'll be back... one way... or another.
Falling.
Rapid descent.
Flying.
God damn it, Caroline.
Never unplug a program when I'm engaged.
You just ruined the whole effect.
Falling, floating, and flying?
So, what's next, fucking?
What are you pissed off about?
You said you were going to take me to the city... but as usual you're hooked up into that machine.
Well, why didn't you remind me?
I did.
Oh, babe, I'm sorry.
Oh, Caroline.
I'm sorry.
This is not a good time for me right now.
I'm really sorry.
Get ready.
We can still get a hotel.
We don't need to go anywhere.
I'm ready right now.
Larry, I want to go.
I don't feel like being around people right now.
I don't feel like going to the city.
You never want to go anywhere.
Caroline... I need your support.
I'm going through a lot of changes right now.
Well, I'm going through a lot of changes, too.
You're too obsessed with your work to even notice.
I'm young, Larry, OK?
And I'm not going to become a recluse just for you.
I'm into reality reality, not this artificial reality.
This technology is going to change the world.
This is the future... and you're afraid of it.
Yeah, well, it may be the future to you, Larry... but it's the same old shit to me.
I give up.
Hey, Jobe!
Hi, Peter!
You've finished Big Red.
Hi, Jobe.
Hi, Mrs. Parkette.
Come over and have some Kool-Aid with Peter when you're done.
Thanks, Mom!
Peter, look what I got you.
The Nuke Masters special edition!
Yeah. It's 3-D, too.
But where are the glasses?
Glasses?
That's OK. I've got a pair of my own anyway.
Look at the blades, man.
If you boys listen real careful, you can hear the panpipes... of the little people in the grass there.
Right, Terry.
I hear them all the time.
Hi, Dr. Angelo.
Can we play
Cyber-Boogie today?
Yeah, sure.
That would be fine.
Damn.
Peter!
Get your ass over here!
I got to go.
Hi, Dad.
I told you not to leave that fucking bike in my way!
Didn't I?
Sorry, Dad.
What is wrong with you?
Didn't I tell you not to play with that moron anymore?
You want to get stupid?
Get in the house.
I'm tired of this shit.
Come on.
That boy was told to take care of this.
He constantly shirks his duties.
Can't have these godless little creatures at the altar.
It's sacrilege!
Where are you, boy?
You're never here where you should be.
Four times in as many weeks... he's forgotten his duty to the parish!
He brings the wrath of the Lord on himself... just like his namesake.
Jobe, are you in there?
Answer me, boy!
God saw fit to make you a ward of this church... and you must earn your keep.
I've tried to teach that stupid mind responsibility... since you were five years old.
Which of God's lessons helps you to remember best, Jobe?
I'll remember my chores,
Father, I promise!
Journal entry, May 1.
Work, marriage, life... what a joke.
I'm going now, Larry.
My plane leaves in an hour.
It's better for both of us this way.
Drinking all that whiskey isn't going to help your depression.
It's probably going to make it worse.
Yes, you're right, Caroline.
It is probably going to make it worse.
Well, don't blame me.
You have no idea of what
I'm going through, do you?
My work is falling apart, and you decide to leave me.
It's dead for both of us, so why don't you give it up?
Good-bye, Larry.
Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.
Mother of God, pray for us sinners... now and at the hour of our death. Amen.
Big Red.
Booting audio journal.
May 10 entry.
Recording.
Oh, Jesus... this hiatus is driving me insane.
When I think of what
I might have accomplished... with a human subject.
I've got to find a way to continue the work on my own.
There's so much to do.
I can't wait any longer.
Full.
Hi, Jobe.
Hi, Dr. Angelo.
How are you?
Looks like you're working hard.
Yeah. I'm a real hard worker.
Jobe, do you like to play games?
Yeah. Peter says you have the best games.
I have a game in my house that you might like to play.
Would you like that?
OK.
Remember, one of the
4 shapes on the bottom row...
You see them down there?
Matches one of the shapes on the top row.
So put your finger on here... and move that shape to the question mark, all right?
Incorrect.
Try again.
OK, here we go.
There.
There.
Incorrect.
Don't worry.
Take your time. Here we go.
Correct answer.
You did it. Very good.
Let's play another game.
Come here, Peter. Come here!
I'm going to get you, Peter.
All right.
Look at that!
Let's go.
Watch out! Holy moley!
Come on, Peter. Slow down.
I'm going to hit the wall.
I'm getting dizzy.
Peter, wait!
Come on, Peter. Come on back.
Peter, I'm getting scared.
Game over.
Why don't you go upstairs and get some drinks?
Hey, Jobe. It's OK.
It's just a game.
I was really bad.
Well, you'll get used to games.
Thanks, Peter.
Hey, Jobe.
Hey.
I was flying upside-down,
Dr. Angelo.
Come on. Hop up.
Come over here.
Sit down.
You know, Jobe...
I have other... different games.
I even have one that could help make you smarter.
I was born dumb.
But... you would like to be smarter, wouldn't you?
I don't know.
Well, if you were smarter, people wouldn't be able to... take advantage of you.
Do you understand what I mean, Jobe?
- Yeah.
- And?
Sometimes they do.
They do.
Can you keep a secret?
Well...
I'll tell you one.
I can make you smarter... but only if you want.
And you must never tell anyone.
You mean a secret for just you and me two?
That's right.
Well, I bet you already know, don't you?
So don't you tell anybody, OK?
OK?
Well, you're as healthy as a mule.
When can we play the games?
Soon, Jobe.
I need to give you a shot of vitamins first.
I had a shot once,
Dr. Angelo, and it hurt.
This won't.
Trust me.
I'm very good at this.
That looks like a gun.
OK, just relax your arm.
Relax your arm. Relax.
Look over there.
Look over there.
It didn't hurt.
Just relax.
Your head's going to be a blank for a while.
All right?
Yeah.
Just breathe now.
Too dark.
No, it's not going to be in a while.
Just breathe and relax.
That's it.
In a while, it's going to be like... being up there with the stars, Jobe.
Like going to another planet.
You're going to feel a tingling sensation in your hands... but don't panic.
It's OK.
I'm right here with you.
It's all part of the game.
OK, here we go.
Cortex stimulation engaged.
Brain stem strobe enabled.
Is that my hand?
It's going to hit me!
No, it's not going to hit you.
Just relax. Just breathe.
Strobe velocity increasing.
Journal entry, May 10.
The electrochemistry of his brain... has responded better than I'd expected.
I'm going to step up the virtual treatments... and increase the dosage of nootropic drugs.
I should see escalations in his brain patterns... by the end of the week.
It's too late to turn back now.
Jobe, what's the matter?
I'm hungry.
Well, go eat.
His mind is like a clean, hungry sponge.
Synaptic activity has increased
400% in less than a month.
His human brain is responding to the nootropics... and virtual stimulation more rapidly than my animal subjects.
Go on! Go faster, Peter!
Go on!
I can catch you right now!
Come on and get me, Peter!
Come on!
I'm going to get you now!
You better not get too excited
'cause I'm getting you!
Look right there!
Come on!
I got you!
Game over.
Yes! You nailed it, Jobe!
You nailed it!
Whoa, that was sketched.
Finally some real competition.
Yeah, he got you that time, didn't he, Peter?
Congratulations.
You just graduated to the next level, Jobe.
Hi.
You got a horse?
What are you doing?
Why are you standing there half-naked, exposing yourself?
What sort of perverted behavior is this?
You should knock before you come into somebody's house.
This is my house.
I pay the rent, and
I want to cash my checks now... because I want to buy some new clothes.
And I'm going to buy some cowboy boots... and I'm going to make this place a ranch.
It's that Dr. Angelo, isn't it?
He's been feeding the Devil in your head!
No, he hasn't!
I'll see to that.
You know, you shouldn't hit people.
You shouldn't hit people like that.
Very impressive.
Did you use the Project 5 formulas on this subject?
As a base.
But I've totally reconfigured... both the nootropic and the cyberlearning programs... without aggression factors.
Of course.
That only makes sense.
I can't believe you went ahead and did this, Larry.
Look at the comparisons.
It works with a human subject, Timms.
It's incredible work, Larry.
So... what do you say?
I've gone as far as I can in my lab at home.
I need access to the main lab to go further.
There's no telling how far I can take Jobe.
I can't do this without your help.
What's it going to be,
Ms. Burke?
Would you check my fluids, Jake?
Do I know you?
I mow your lawn.
No. You're not the Lawnmower Man.
Well... wow.
You've certainly changed.
I don't know how you did it, but I approve.
Ms. Burke, I filled her up with trans fluid.
No charge.
Thanks, Jake.
You're welcome.
Well, I'm looking forward to having my lawn mowed... soon.
She's got the hots for you, Jobe boy.
You got to be kidding me.
She's just teasing this half-wit.
Look at him. You got him dressed up like a fool.
I've known her ever since her husband died.
She's been kicking up her heels with all the young studs.
And I tell you, she wants this young fella.
Don't you call her no whore around me, old man.
Whores do it for money.
She's got money. She's young.
She does it 'cause she likes it.
I told you to shut up.
Hey, Jake, don't do that.
OK, Lawnmower Man.
Dr. Angelo, I think people can tell that... that I'm changing.
Just don't draw attention to yourself, OK?
Just keep doing the lawn job for now.
It's not going to last forever.
I like doing the lawns.
That's good.
I always liked doing them.
That's good.
You're cleared. Go ahead.
Why is this place so far from town?
The work here at VSI is government classified.
Top Secret.
Good afternoon, Dr. Angelo.
Looks like a dungeon in here, Dr. Angelo.
You see this, Jobe?
Holy moley!
Come on. It's OK.
Look.
This is some of the most advanced computer equipment... in the world, Jobe.
In these gyrospheres, we wear full cybersuits... which allow us to enter into virtual reality and move.
Your entire nervous system and endocrine system... will be in sync with the brain expansion.
Endocrine?
Endocrine: it carries secretions of certain glands... like the thyroid, adrenal, and pituitary... which regulate growth.
Sometimes...
I think I've discovered a new planet... but one I'm inventing instead of discovering.
I've just sighted the shore of one of its continents.
Booting biology systems readouts.
Bio-monitors on.
Choice.
Graph 5... engage.
Change brain wave parameters.
Brain wave pattern altered.
Prepare brain stem injection.
Initiate brain stem.
Insertion complete.
Let me off! Dr. Angelo!
Synaptic reaction positive.
My head, Dr. Angelo!
I like it!
Change brain wave parameters.
Initiate second level.
Insertion complete.
Lemonade.
Think he likes lemonade?
It's so hot today, Jobe.
Why don't you come up for a cold glass of lemonade?
Oh, Jesus, Mother of God, would you look at that?
Go on, you dolt!
Go on!
Jobe, have you ever kissed a girl before?
Really?
Give me your tongue.
Give me your tongue.
Soft.
Hard.
He absorbed Latin yesterday in less than two hours.
It took me a year just to learn the Latin alphabet.
God damn,
Larry, I am speechless.
I think it's time we brought this out of the closet... and report these results directly... to the Department of Scientific
Intelligence in Washington.
DSI is bound to offer you both tits.
The timing isn't right.
There's some factors that need ironing out.
Iron them out.
I'm not going to be able to keep this quiet much longer.
The historical perspective of expressionism, as typified by
Van Gogh and Gauguin...
Rhythm and blues. You like it?
Yeah, sure.
I like it.
Classical.
You should try listening to a whole tune once.
You might like it.
Too much to hear.
I get it all by sampling segments, anyway.
Who taught you how to drive?
Me!
There you go. Enjoy yourselves.
Jim, you need anything else?
Hi, Dolly!
Hi, Jobe.
I'll be right with you.
Don't you want to check out the comics first?
I gave them up, Peter.
No way!
Matter of fact, I got my whole collection in that crate... and I'm giving it to you.
Whoa, awesome! Dudical!
Order me fries and a Coke, all right?
Are you all right?
I don't got time for this.
I hope he doesn't puke on the counter.
What's wrong with that fool?
He's probably been taking dope.
Look at that guy!
Weirdo.
Whatever the hell's his problem?
Probably dancing with the booze lady.
He's having a breakdown.
Oh, man!
Are you all right, Jobe?
Peter, I got to go.
The things that people think.
I had to use all my concentration to block it.
I don't want it to happen again... because if it does,
I think I would go crazy.
It's amazing.
Even with the treatments stopped... your abilities continue to change and grow.
I speculated that if psychic powers existed... this research would be the key to unlocking them.
But this is beyond anything I ever expected.
I mean, like the accelerated learning.
The results are completely unexpected.
Completely.
Well... don't worry, Jobe.
I'll sort something out.
I've got to keep this psychic development quiet... especially from Timms.
Who's Timms?
I'm preparing Angelo to present his results to you personally... as you've requested.
He's met with incredible success.
Precisely why we feel it's time for you to guide his efforts... in a specific direction.
Which direction is that?
We're most anxious to see what effect... the original Project 5 formulas will have... on this subject.
Mr. Director, the aggression vectors in Project 5 caused...
That was an ape, Timms.
We want to know what effect it will have on a human subject.
It's an essential step for us to determine... certain covert sector applications for Angelo's work.
It will be difficult in the extreme... to convince Angelo to reinstate the original formulas.
Then you'll have to be persuasive in the extreme.
Run batch 505.
Program change initiated.
Initiate brain stem.
Brain wave pattern altered.
Can you hear me, Jobe?
Relax.
Shut down theta stimulation.
I'm coming over. Stay there.
Warning. Endocrine, adrenal, increasing to fatal levels.
System shutdown.
I saw God!
I touched God!
I was pushing.
I didn't even think of Jobe's safety.
That amount of brain swelling should have killed him.
Instead, it completely disappeared, leaving no lesions.
Somehow the experiment is out of my control.
I'm stopping the treatments... until I can figure out what went wrong.
Confessions.
Eavesdrop on real people... telling their innermost secrets, darkest desires.
I saw this woman today.
I couldn't help myself.
God, he smells good.
I want to get him up for something strange tonight.
I can read your mind.
Oh, right.
You sure have some strange fantasies.
Come with me.
Let's live a little...
Jobe, it's so huge in here.
This will be the best ride of your life, Marnie.
You're the best ride of my life.
In here we can be anything we want to be.
I'll see you on the inside.
Wow! It's my hands!
Look at this!
Oh, my God!
Jobe, where are you?
I'm right here, Marnie.
Come over here.
You're beautiful.
I'm stuck.
I'm stuck in this stuff, Jobe.
It's from our primal mind.
I don't like it, so let me up.
Jobe, let me up!
Now!
Nothing can hurt us in here.
Jobe, you're scaring me.
I want out!
I know what you really want.
Watch this.
Oh, my God! What are you doing?
Jobe, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
Oh, my God, let me up!
Oh, God!
Warning: brain pattern abnormal.
Automatic system shutdown.
Marnie, are you OK?
Marnie, I couldn't stop.
Dr. Angelo said nothing could happen.
I didn't mean to hurt you!
What did Dr. Angelo do to me?
I have to find out.
I can't fly to fucking
Washington tomorrow!
I told you...
I have to resolve some problems before presenting my work.
This is premature.
I'm not ready.
You're ready enough.
Oh, shit.
Be reasonable.
I can't keep this secret any longer.
We can't cut ourselves off from the hand that feeds us.
I thought you were doing lawns today.
I wish I were.
Mind over matter, Dr. Angelo.
Not a miracle.
A fact.
I have to run some tests.
Get a clearer picture.
This is all so new.
It's not new.
I realize that nothing we've been doing is new.
We haven't been tapping into new areas of the brain.
We've just been awakening the most ancient.
This technology is simply a route to powers... that conjurers and alchemists used centuries ago.
The human race lost that knowledge... and now I'm reclaiming it through virtual reality.
You're moving too fast.
Even with all these new abilities, there are dangers.
Man may evolve a thousandfold through this technology... but the rush must be tempered with wisdom.
You're trying to get inside my head, Jobe.
I can feel you pushing.
You realize, Dr. Angelo... that my intelligence has surpassed yours... and I can't allow your fear of what you don't understand... to get in the way of this work.
The treatments have to continue.
We have no choice.
I was terrified of him.
I'm sure he knew it.
He surpassed me, all right.
But his insights seem... twisted.
I fear for Jobe's sanity.
This Washington trip couldn't come at a worse time.
So as you can see, the results with this one human subject... indicate unlimited applications for mental disability alone... such as retardation,
Alzheimer's.
And the possibilities for education are staggering.
With the proper funding, we could perfect this... within the year.
Right.
Any questions?
The Director wants to know... if you've noticed any significant changes... since the Project 5 formula was reinstated.
We only reinstated those formulas a few days ago.
Not enough time for any findings.
Wait a minute.
What are you talking about?
I was going to speak with you about this after the meeting.
The Shop requested that we resume... the original Batch 5 with Jobe.
You idiot.
You goddamn idiot!
Do you know what you have done?
There is no telling what the Project 5 abstract... will do to a human being.
Do you understand me?
What Project 5 will do to a human... is exactly what we want to find out.
You know what it did to Roscoe 1138... and he was the most advanced chimp we ever had!
Before that, there were two other chimps... who got into fits of rage so severe... they tore each other apart!
That's it, isn't it?
It's always like that with you guys.
It only leads to one thing: war.
Why didn't you include the development... of Jobe's other abilities in your report, Larry?
Don't look so shocked.
You may have tried to hide it... but I have witnessed what your new formulas, not Batch Five... have done to your human subject.
I've had enough.
Make sure he goes back to the hotel.
What other abilities?
Your behavior cost us a lot of ground tonight.
I had to talk for hours to repair the damage.
My behavior?
You fucking sycophant.
You've been lying to me all along.
For security reasons.
Piss off!
Look, without The Shop's financial involvement... this project wouldn't exist.
Then maybe it shouldn't.
I hate to be the one to break it to you, Larry... but the concept of dirty money went out... when the Catholic Church got into banking 300 years ago.
It's all dirty money.
For Christ's sake, don't let some juvenile ethics problem... get in your way.
Your research is too important.
You'll be more realistic in a few days.
They're going to pick up
Jobe and bring him here.
The Director wants a personal demonstration... of his... progress.
They're not going to get Jobe.
There's no walking away, Larry.
All right. Let's get him.
Yes, sir.
Shit.
They're here to pick me up as well. Right, Timms?
You can't leave!
You're integral to the project!
Oh, shit!
Go check the other wing.
You forgot your messages.
No, it's too much!
I'm Shop, Dr. Angelo.
You're going to have to come with me.
Oh, excuse me.
Here. Here, take that.
What do I do with this?
Cover him.
Devil in your head.
Who you talking to, half-wit?
Which of God's lessons...
I told you not to play with that moron.
Devil in your head.
Shit!
There's no need to panic, Timms.
We know where he's going.
We'll send a grab team in tomorrow... and pick them both up at once.
I want you to get back there.
Cancel Angelo's clearance at VSI.
We don't want him stealing his work, now, do we?
I'll let you know what the next step is... after we've had a chance to examine Jobe Smith.
Give me strength, that I might prepare the way... for those who will follow.
Who's there?
Hail, Mary, full of grace...
Who is it?
Who's there?
The church is closed for the night.
Come back tomorrow.
I'll hear your confession.
I've come for your confession.
I don't want you here tonight, Jobe.
Leave me alone. Get out.
The good Father McKeen.
Took in the poor idiot nobody wanted.
What have you done?
The Devil's taken you.
Judgment Day is here!
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.
They're impatient for you.
I have unclean thoughts, but deliver me.
In hell!
I've used thy name in profane fantasies.
I have committed cruel acts of molestation.
Be done!
What are you doing here?
What, you going to do some night mowing?
You're a strange motherfucker... and I am too tired for this,
Lawnmower Man.
So why don't you take your silly ass... and go trick-or-treating or something?
Shit!
Fuck!
Get away!
Don't hurt me.
Please.
Lawnmower Man's in your head now, Jake.
There's no escape, ever.
Stop taking his side, Carla!
You're treating him like a little girl!
Damn!
I'm so sorry, Peter.
Why is Dad getting so bad?
I don't know, baby.
He's sick.
Damn kid's toys. lf, in fact, that occurs, it would mean... he is one of the select few... who has been in every Wrestlemania... all seven of them.
Talk about talented!
How long would Bobby last south of the border?
What's that noise?
Help me!
You are going to die!
Hold on.
All right. Come on through.
Hell of a thing.
Hello, Lieutenant.
I'm Dr. Angelo.
I live next door.
What's happened here?
Thanks for coming over.
You saved us a trip.
We're just taking statements from all the neighbors... just to see if they saw or heard anything unusual.
There's a little boy.
His name is Peter.
Has anything happened to him?
Oh, no, he's fine.
It's just his dad...
Excuse me, Lieutenant.
Where's the rest of him?
Birdbath.
Did you say the birdbath?
Birdbath.
Lieutenant, the wife and the kid... they're getting ready to go down to the station.
Said they slept through the whole thing.
Didn't hear or see anything.
Didn't hear anything.
The lab boys tell me that somebody chased Parkette... through the house with a power lawnmower.
I would have thought that would have made some racket.
Crazy with the heat.
Schiz-o-fucking-phrenia... all over town last night.
What else happened last night?
Well, somebody torched poor old Father McKeen... with a flame-thrower or something.
Must have been a Satan cult or something.
Either that or that weird human spontaneous combustion thing.
That really happens sometimes.
Hell of a thing.
My God.
That's not all.
Marnie Burke was found wandering around stark naked... laughing her ass off, flipped out.
The psychiatrist figured she'd probably witnessed... one of the murders, and she's just in shock... but I've seen people flipped out before... and this girl is flipped out for good.
I don't believe she'll ever stop laughing.
Two bizarre murders in one night.
This world is chock-full of nuts, Cooley.
Don't forget that.
Weirdos, schizos, bozos.
Well, accidents happen.
That's all there is to it.
Two bizarre accidents in one night.
Accidents?
You were just calling them murders.
We'll just file a routine report.
Just clean and tidy.
Oh, Peter, come here.
Come here.
It's OK, son. It's OK.
How did this happen?
Jesus Christ.
Jobe, come on.
I gave myself a boost, Doctor.
Virtual reality is not just a simulation.
It's a whole other world... a new electric dimension.
Utopia, Doctor.
The utopia that men have dreamed of for a thousand years... and I'll be the conduit.
You want to create monsters.
You killed two people, Jobe.
Why?
You've got to let me help you.
Help me?
I'm going to help you,
Dr. Angelo.
I'm going to help all of you... cleanse this diseased planet.
This technology has peeled back a layer... to reveal another universe.
Virtual reality will grow... just as the telegraph grew to the telephone.
As the radio to the TV.
It will be everywhere.
You're having delusions, Jobe.
Struggle for reason.
I'm going back to VSI... to complete the final stage of my evolution.
I'm going to project myself into the main frame computer.
I'll become pure energy.
Once I've entered in the neural net... my birth cry will be the sound... of every phone on this planet ringing in unison.
Listen to what you're saying.
The first sign of psychosis is a Christ complex.
Cyberchrist.
Please listen to me, Jobe.
The Project 5 abstracts that you were exposed to... were never meant for the human mind.
You've had a psychotic break.
Let me try to reverse that.
What are you blocking?
You can't hide anything from me, Dr. Angelo.
So The Shop is coming to pick me up... and you've betrayed me, haven't you?
I'd like to proceed to Angelo's residence, sir.
Very well. Leave the van's cameras on transmit.
I want to monitor from here.
Yes, sir.
Now you can witness the impossible, Dr. Angelo.
Let me pull the curtain back so you can watch.
We'll check the house.
What the hell...
I'm going back to VSI now... and once I'm inside the main frame...
I'll have access to over
5,000 other databases.
And from those 5,000...
I can reach out again and again and again... eventually inhabiting the entire planetary network.
By the year 2001... there won't be a person on this planet... who isn't hooked into it and hooked into me.
I'm sorry you hate what you have created.
Right, Jobe.
I'll be right there.
Dr. Angelo has been working on something else... behind our backs.
He's developed a fantastic new energy weapon.
I've observed a demonstration.
It's very advanced.
I want you to gather his research... all disks, hard copies, everything.
Erase the files from the main frame there... then transport it all here personally.
I can't believe it.
Not Angelo.
Not a weapon.
He is totally opposed...
Believe it, Timms.
He took out two of my men in a way I've never seen before.
I sure have been missing you, Jobe.
Peter, where are you going?
I want you to come right back.
Jobe, wait up!
I told him to come down here and pick me up after work.
What's going on here?
What the fuck?
What did you open the gate for?
We didn't.
Some kind of malfunction.
That's it.
The back. That's it.
Can you do it?
Did the same guy that killed my dad get to you?
Yes, Peter.
I'll explain it all later.
Go upstairs and tell your mother to call the police.
Don't worry.
Go on quickly, go.
Erasing 261Y8K.
Confirm erase?
There's a little problem at the main gate.
It opened by itself, and it won't close.
Send everything you've got down to the main gate.
Right.
Now!
Welcome to VSI main frame.
Please enter pass code.
Analyzing.
Pass code cleared.
You have access to the network node.
File 15 blocked.
What's happening?
Someone's hacking the main frame from the outside.
They're in, and they're running a computer virus... that's placing triple key encryption codes... on all outside access and network connections.
What the fuck does that mean?
We're being cut off.
The main frame will be totally isolated... in less than two minutes.
Off the net.
Something's wrong.
I can't even get an operator.
Explosives.
Come on.
You hear something?
What?
It sounds weird.
Fuck you!
Holy shit!
I have to go now, Terry.
Well, OK, Jobe.
What are you doing here?
Leave me alone.
I'll wait for you down the road.
I want you out of here as fast as you can.
But I want to go with you to find Jobe.
I understand, Peter... but I want you to stay with your mother, OK?
Peter, get in the car.
Larry, be careful.
We'll wait here, OK?
I'm in.
I'm in.
System overload.
Automatic shutdown inoperative.
Oh, my God, Jobe.
I can't believe this.
Outside terminal activity control.
Now to get out of here.
Simple combination.
Oh, Jobe, what's happened?
He really did it.
Denied?
Denied!
I must find a way out.
I can't believe this!
I must find a way out!
I can't let you do it, Jobe!
You!
Yes, me.
You did this!
You cut the network connections, but I'll find a way out.
All this power... isn't meant to be in the hands of one person.
You're wrong.
You need to be led, just like everyone else.
It's a basic need.
This technology is meant to expand human communication... but you're not even human anymore.
What you've become terrifies me.
You're a freak!
Your naive idiocy makes me very angry!
Human!
This universe is mine.
I am God here.
I sense your thoughts.
What are you hiding?
The bombs.
Jesus, the bombs.
Bombs?
You forced me to.
So you were willing to die?
I'll stop them.
You can't defuse the bombs, can you?
You lost all your power over the physical world... once you transferred in here.
Stop!
So you've given me one final game to play.
I find a way out, or I die in this diseased main frame.
But that's not my destiny.
I have things to do, people to see... a billion calls to make.
You will die in the explosion.
You're trapped.
You're trapped in here, aren't you?
You're trapped right here.
Peter is here.
Jobe, he's in here.
He's going to die.
Jobe, please.
Please, Jobe!
Don't sacrifice Peter.
You and I have been responsible... for so much destruction.
What's happening?
I don't want more death.
Go. Save him.
Jobe, come back with me.
Hurry!
Go!
Access denied.
Help! I'm lost!
Somebody!
We've got to get out of here!
The whole building's going to blow up!
The door's locked!
It won't open!
Open.
Run, run!
Access denied.
Get down, Peter! Quick!
Get down!
There's got to be one.
Let me in!
Come on, Peter, quick!
Peter, come on.
Where is it?
Access denied.
Maintenance line access granted.
A back door.
Get out of here! Go now!
July 10.
Last journal entry for a while.
I won't let Jobe's death be for nothing.
What happened to him is my responsibility.
For some reason, I've been given a second chance... so I'm taking my work underground.
I can't let it fall into the wrong hands again.
If we can somehow embrace our wisdom... instead of ignorance... this technology will free the mind of man... not enslave it.
We're ready.
Good.
They'll be here soon.
OK. Let's go.
Whoo-hoo!
- Come on, we're outta here!
- Easy, Rocky.
All right, guys, we're 15 seconds from the drop zone.
All right, pinheads, the Stealth Eagle's about to fly.
Ditto for the Swooping Swallow.
Well, lead on, flyboys.
- That's a lotta air!
- After you, Skull!
What are you? Crazy? This was your idea!
Hey, guys. You might wanna slip those on.
Good idea.
We're three seconds away from the target zone. Aisha, you're on!
Yes!
Stylin'!
On your tail! Whoo!
All systems go!
Banzai!
Whoo-hoo!
- Show 'em your stuff.
- You got it. Surf's up!
Whoo-hoo! Yeah!
Catch you on the flip side.

PA: With the arrival of Ryan"s Comet two days away, the Angel Grove jump-a-thon will breathe new life into the old observatory.
Tickets to see the comet are at the Fire Department booth.
Now, folks, raise your eyes to the skies, cos here comes the team from Angel Grove High!
All right, Dad, pay close attention.
This is how the pros do it.
- I didn't do so bad.
- You landed in the parking lot.
- It was embarrassing.
- Well...
PA: The first of the team is beginning his final approach. It"s Adam!
As he rounds the turn, he looks awful low... but he pulls up just in time and hits the target dead centre.
Right behind him is skydiver Billy... who manages a perfect landing!
Skydiver number three is Kimberly!
Her landing is flawless!
And here comes Rocky... who lands right on target!
Here comes Aisha! She makes it a perfect five out of five landing and ties the 1986 record.
So now it"s all up to Tommy Oliver.
Can he make it six for six?
Yeah! Go, Tommy!
PA: He"s making his final approach.
Looks a bit wide, but still OK.
Almost to the ground now. Can he do it?
He does! The Angel Grove team sets a new city record! Way to go, guys!
- Let's go.
- OK.
PA: Remember, folks, Ryan"s Comet will be passing in just two days.
- Looking good up there.
- Thanks. Maybe next time you can join us.
Really? Could l?
Yeah, well, we'll talk about that, Fred... in about 10 or 1 2 years, all right?
Congratulations, Tommy.
The observatory just got a new lease on life.
- Yeah. Thanks, man.
- FRED: Awesome.
- Ryan's Comet is passing over in two days!
- Guys, we did it!
- That was awesome, Tommy.
- Wonderful.
- Thanks, guys. You too, man.
- Hey, has anybody seen Bulk and Skull?
Ernie's is serving a free dessert with lunch.
They probably landed on the roof.
- PILOT: Hurry up. We're runnin' out of fuel.
- BULK: I gotta be the eagle.
I'm gonna be the eagle!
Be the swallow!
- Be the swallow.
- Come on, baby!
- BULK: Let go of me!
- SKULL: I want my mommy!
TOMMY: Rock and roll!
# The mountain is high #
# The valley is low #
# And you're confused on which way to go #
# So I've come here to give you a hand #
# And lead you into the promised land #
- Air time!
- Up and away!
# Come on and take it be my side #
# Come on and take a tree ride #
- Let's take a shortcut.
- Right behind you!
# Come on and take a free ride #
# Come on and take it by my side #
SKULL: Hey, this doesn't look like the target landing zone! Where's the free food?
You idiot! Your screaming threw off the Stealth Eagle's sense of direction.
Stealth Eagle? Lame duck is more like it.
- Hey!
- Uh-oh.
- You guys, what do you think you're doing?
- Uh...
We're from the Angel Grove
Building lnspector's office.
Yeah. That building's supposed to be over there!
And what's that man doing without proper foot protection?
- Who's in charge around here, huh?
- Huh?
- Huh?
- Huh?
Hey, Dave! Come and have a look at this.
Go on, Dave.
- That was a close one.
- Uh-huh.
- You hungry?
- Always.
What in the world is this?
It sure as heck ain't DWP.
Let's get a crane in here.
OK, take it up!
Incredible.
What do you think it is?
No... idea.
Aaaaarrgghh!
John, you all right?
ROCKY: Let's get somethin' to eat.
TOMMY: Hang on.
Let's go over there.
- What's up, Alpha?
- Rangers, Zordon needs you. It"s urgent.
We're on our way.
Aye-yai-yai-yai! The subtronic interphasers are short-circuiting.
I have to find a way to alternate the frequency modulators.
What's goin' on?
A massive surge of evil energy is overloading our sensors. Aye-yai-yai-yai-yai!
Rangers, you must act swiftly.
- The planet is in grave danger.
- Danger from what?
6,000 years ago a morphological being known as lvan Ooze ruled the world with a reign of unparalleled terror.
He was on the verge of completing construction of his ultimate weapons: the Ecto-Morphicon Titans, twin machines capable of enslaving the entire universe.
What happened to him?
A group of warriors like yourselves lured him to into a hyperlock chamber and buried him deep underground.
But now the chamber has been accidentally uncovered.
You must return it to the depths before it is opened and lvan is released.
His Ecto-Morphicons were buried near the chamber. If lvan escapes, he'll find them.
Use extreme caution, Rangers. You're dealing with an evil that is beyond all imagination.
- What do I care about some stupid egg?
- This is no ordinary egg!
- Well, I say we hard-boil the thing!
- I'm with her. I'm hungry.
- That's cos you're a pig!
- Hey, Kurt, take a look at this.
No need to wake him. In fact, why don't you take a little nap yourself?
PIG: Yeah, I could do that.
I just choose not to.
Zip your lips.
After 2,000 years of searching... you are finally within my grasp.
And now... Iet's crack this egg.
Excellent.
Yuck!
What?! You spent 2,000 years looking for a tub of snot?!
Patience, motor-mouth. Watch.
Yes!
Cool!
Ladies and gentlemen!
The Ooze is back!
Yeah!
- He's so handsome!
- Why, thank you.
I am Lord Zedd, sworn enemy of all that is good and decent.
- It is a supreme honour to finally meet you.
- How can I ever repay you?
Do you recall the name Zordon of Eltar?
I think he's heard of him.
I want you to destroy Zordon... so that my evil may once again reign supreme!
I will not only destroy him...
I will obliterate his entire legacy.
It will be as if Zordon of Eltar never existed!
- Finally, a real man!
- ( growls )
We shall leave you to weave your evil ways.
Let's go, Rita.
What is that odious stench?
Smells like... teenagers.
Anybody see anything?
Let's take a look up there.
Ugh!
- AISHA: What is it?
- ROCKY: It reeks.
Hey! What are you kids doin' here?
You haven't seen a morphological being lurking around here?
- A morphological being?
- Yeah.
What the heck is that?
Wait a second.
Did it look something like this?
- Ew, gross!
- Too kind. Allow me to introduce myself.
I am the galactically feared, globally reviled, universally despised...
They call me lvan Ooze.
Well, pack your bags, cos we're sending you back where you came from.
Gee, a teenager with a big mouth.
Not much has changed in 6,000 years.
You obviously don't know who you're dealing with, Mr Raisin Head.
- Really?
- Yeah. We're the Power Rangers.
Where's my autograph book? Ha!
Power Rangers, huh?
So Zordon's still usin' a bunch of kids to do his dirty work.
Well... meet my kids!
Ew.
From this moment forth the world as you know it shall cease to exist!
Welcome to my nightmare!
Bye-bye, kiddies!
He's gone.
- What are we gonna do?
- ROCKY: There's plenty of room down there.
Go, guys!
- Let's take these beasts!
- Spread out!
Welcome to my nightmare.

- Are you OK?
- Yeah.
Adam!
- AISHA: They got us cornered!
- BILLY: We can't hold them off!
- BILLY: There's too many of 'em.
- Let's do it, guys! It's morphin' time!
Pterodactyl!
Triceratops!
Tyrannosaurus!
Mastodon!
Sabre-toothed tiger!
White tiger!
# Go, go, Power Rangers #
# Go, go, Power Rangers #
# Mighty Morphin Power Rangers #
- Where'd they go?
- Keep your eyes peeled.
Heads up, guys! Over there!
- Careful. It could be a trap.
- Right.
Let's go.
Alpha, my sensors tell me the Rangers were too late.
- lvan is on his way here.
- Don't worry.
Nobody enters the command centre without a power coin.
Well, almost nobody.
Hey, pretty fancy-schmancy.
I guess if you invest your money well over 60 centuries, you can buy something pretty nice.
Uh-oh.
Aye-yai-yai-yai-yai-yai-yai....
You haven't changed, Ooze. You're still picking on creatures smaller than yourself.
Put a sock in it, Z! 10 minutes out of the egg and I'm listening to one of your lectures.
You locked me into your stuffy hyperlock chamber and tossed me away in the depths like yesterday's trash.
You any idea what it's like to be locked up in a rotten egg for 6,000 years? It's boring.
Not to mention I've had a charley horse since the Renaissance.
- You won't get away with this, Ooze.
- You robbed me of my prime.
I was the supreme ruler of the most foul empire in the universe.
And now... it's time to pay the piper.
Oh, the things that I have missed!
The Black Plague!
The Spanish lnquisition!
The Brady Bunch reunion!
- BILLY: This place gives me the creeps.
- AISHA: I heard that.
TOMMY: I've got a bad feelin' about this place.
- KIMBERLY: Anybody see anything?
- We need some light.
Activating power beam.
- They gotta be around here somewhere.
- Activating power scope.
TOMMY: Talk to me, Rocky. What do we got?
I don't know what these purple creeps are made of, but I can't lock 'em down.
TOMMY: All right. Stay alert.
- Over there!
- Let's power up!
- ALL: Right!
- AISHA: Here they come!
You guys make me sick, sick, sick!
Back off!
Have a nice flight!
Later, dudes.
It's gonna be one messy night.
- Up and over?
- Let's do it!
ADAM: Rocky, behind you!
Goin' airborne!
These guys don't know when to quit.
Double whammy?
You're on.
Uh-oh!
Whoaaaa!
That does it. Stegastinger!
Did you miss me?
Pterodactyl Thunderwhip!
Have a nice trip! See you next fall.
Bye-bye.
Gotta love it.
Hold on, Aisha!
One, two, three, four, five, six!
Aisha!
- You OK?
- They're tough.
- Let's finish these purple parasites.
- You said it.
I want you guys to meet Saba.
ALL: Uh-oh!
ALL: Yeah!
TOMMY: Now let's go find lvan.
KIMBERLY: Hey, what's happening?
BILLY: We're losing power.
- What's goin' on?
- Alpha, come in.
- Something's wrong.
- We'd better get back. Let's go, guys.
BILLY: Oh, no.
- Ooze.
- TOMMY: Let's get it open.
TOMMY: Look at this place.
TOMMY: I can't believe it.
AISHA: What happened here?
KIMBERLY: Oh, no.
ADAM: Zordon!
What's happening to him?
Outside of his time warp, he's dying.
BILLY: He needs power.
Rangers.
Thank goodness you are safe.
Come on, we gotta get you back inside.
I'm afraid that is impossible.
The power has been destroyed.
It is gone.
The Zords... the weapons... all of it.
The Power Rangers are no more.
Ivan Ooze has won.
- We're losing him.
- Zordon, you can't leave us!
Ever since you came into our lives, you've been like a father to us all.
You must be strong.
Rangers!
TOMMY: Alpha.
- Are you OK?
- I'll be fine.
There may be a power that can save Zordon.
- What power?
- It is on the distant planet of Phaedos.
It's very dangerous.
All who have tried for it have perished.
- But we have to try, Alpha.
- Zordon's life force will not last long.
- You won't have much time.
- How can we get it?
Maybe if I can download the last plasmatic morphing gem into the transport core,
I might have just enough power to get you there.
- But there won't be any left to get you back.
- So, how do we get back?
We have to hope that the power is there.
Zordon's life depends on it.
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.
We may not have our powers, but we're still the Power Rangers.
Remember, Rangers,
Zordon doesn't have much time.
Oh, no! Aye-yai-yai-yai-yai!
Please hold on, Zordon!
I can't believe it! How could he let them slip through his hands?!
He's no better than the rest of the hired help!
Oh, give it a rest.
- Hi, honey, I'm home!
- You egg-sucking purple pinhead!
The Rangers are going after the great power!
I thought you said this guy was the master of disaster!
He's nothing but a slime-infested jelly doughnut!
Finally someone shut her up.
Your feebleness is staggering.
You obviously need a vacation.
I think circumstances force us to choose a new leader... and I pick... me!
Who does this clown think he's dealing with?
The bogeyman is taking over.
No one double-crosses Lord Zedd and lives!
Oh, stop it! It tickles!
My turn.
- RITA: (squeaky voice) Way to go, bonehead!
- ZEDD: You can't trust anyone in this galaxy!
- I love snow globes.
- RITA: Earthquake! Earthquake!
Now you have a choice. You either serve me... or you can join these insufferable dingledorks!
- Goldar, get us out of here!
- Don't listen to that purple booger!
ZEDD: Don't you dare betray me!
- We never liked those dingledorks.
- PIG: You said it. They stink.
So... what are we going to do about the Power Rangers, oh my hideous one?
Ah, yes.
The Power Rangers.
- Good distance.
- Yeah.
Shut your beaks! Now, my Tengu Warriors, you will fly to Phaedos, you will find the Power Rangers and you will tear them apart!
- GOLDAR: Go sic 'em, Tweety!
- PIG: Happy hunting!
Wow.
My gosh. Look at this place.
AISHA: You guys! Over here! Quick!
AISHA: Whoa. Looks like somebody had a bad day.
- What is it?
- I think the question is "What was it?"
Definitely not the welcoming committee, that's for sure.
Come on, guys, we got a job to do.
Taking over the world is one thing.
Finding good help to run it for you, that's the killer.
Would you like me to make a few calls?
No need. I'm going to recruit the parents of Angel Grove.
No offence, boss, but they might find you a little disgusting.
Well, I suppose you'd be the experts on that.
- You forget. I'm a master of disguise.
- How could I forget? I never knew.
First I'll turn them into zombies and then order them to dig up my Ecto-Morphicons.
How you gonna do that?
By showing them the wonders of being wicked with a little bit of lvan's ooze.
Ooh!
Finally I get to finish what I started 6,000 years ago!
Little do they know my weapons of destruction lie buried beneath their feet.
- Stop it! Get to work!
- PIG: Yes, Your Royal Heinous Highness.
Hey.
You OK?
I was just thinking about Zordon.
You know, everything we've been through together.
Look, he's gonna make it.
We'll find this power and then send that slimeball lvan Ooze back to the sewer he crawled out of.
Come on.
What the heck was that?
BILLY: Get down!
TOMMY: Let's move!
ROCKY: Look out!
They're everywhere!
Take cover!
Back off.
- Know the funny thing about morphin'?
- What?
You don't appreciate it till you can't do it!
TOMMY: Kimberly, behind you!
Hang on, Kimberly!
Somebody help me!
- They're too strong!
- We need our powers!
Let me go, Big Bird!
That was amazing. Thanks.
If you want to thank me, go back to wherever it is you came from.
- We can't.
- We were told there was a great power here.
- Is it true?
- Yes.
The ground is littered with the bones of those who have tried for it and failed.
Well, we're different. We won't fail.
Leave Phaedos... before it's too late.
Look, we don't want any trouble.
Our leader Zordon got hurt...
Zordon?
Did you say Zordon?
You know Zordon? Who are you?
I am Dulcea, master warrior of the planet Phaedos.
What has happened to Zordon?
He was attacked by this cosmic being named lvan Ooze.
- lvan Ooze is free?
- You've heard of him?
Ivan Ooze is a monster.
If we don't hurry, your planet is doomed.
Follow me.
Alpha, I am deeply concerned about the Rangers.
Please, Zordon, save your strength.
You need to rest.
We must try to communicate with them.
It is possible I can help them.
If I could locate a vertical deflector, we could make contact through the viewing globe.
Please... please hurry.
Aye-yai-yai-yai-yai! Hold on.
Guys and girls, girls and guys, gather round and feast your eyes.
I promise you all, you just can't lose, when you've got your own supply of lvan's ooze.
- BOY: What are we supposed to do with it?
- Show it to parents, show it to friends.
When you've got your ooze, the fun never ends.
This is kinda gross.
You may have heard that looks can be deceiving.
I'm sure that when you've tried it, you all will be believing.
And did I mention it's free?
- I'll take some.
- Here you go. Who else?
OK, there's enough for everybody.
Take it home in boxes, take it home in cases.
If your parents try to stop you, just throw it in their faces!
BILLY: Dulcea, where are you taking us?
You shall know soon enough.
KIMBERLY: We have to hurry.
Zordon won't last much longer.
TOMMY: Wow.
- AISHA: Amazing.
- TOMMY: What is this place?
DULCEA: These are the ancient ruins of the Ninjetti Temple.
There, beyond the Niola Jungle, is the monolith.
Inside awaits the power of the universe.
The monolith is heavily guarded against intruders.
No one has ever survived an attempt to reach it.
Then how can we?
You were chosen by Zordon.
I have faith in his wisdom.
Can you help us?
We will call upon the sacred animals of the Ninjetti for help.
Fred!
There, that should do it. Let's give it a whirl!
Police have been fielding hundreds of calls from concerned citizens as the number of missing parents continues to grow.
Hi, folks. Ivan Ooze here.
Are you bored with your work?
Are you bored with your life? Then come on down to Ooze City and let"s get sticky!
Aye-yai-yai-yai-yai!
Ivan's evil plot is taking shape.
I just hope they're not too late.
Buried deep within each of us is an animal spirit waiting to be released.
Close your eyes and look deep inside.
Aisha, you are the bear, fierce and unstoppable.
Rocky, powerful, smart, you are the mighty ape.
Billy, you are the wolf, cunning and swift.
Agile Kimberly, light as a feather, you are the crane.
Adam...
- Adam, what's wrong?
- I'm a frog.
Yes, a frog. Like the one you kiss... to get a handsome prince.
And you, Tommy, are the falcon, winged lord of the skies.
To be in harmony with a sacred animal spirit is to have the force of the Ninjetti.
To those who are Ninjetti, anything is possible.
But... I am afraid you must do this on you own.
You're not coming with us, Dulcea?
If only I could.
One step beyond this plateau and I would begin to age as rapidly as Zordon is now.
The strength is inside you. Trust it.
Your sacred animals will be your guide.
May your animal spirits watch over you.
Dad?
Dad?
Dad? Where are you?
IVAN: I forgot how slow parents are.
I thought my Ecto-Morphicons would be dug up by now.
Oh, Goldie, I'm bored.
Let's have some fun. Hey, you!
Dance.
Do the swim.
- Ballet!
- (ballet music)
Hey.
Hey, boss! They're back!
Ah!
My Tengu.
Stop your screeching.
- How did you fare?
- It couldn't have gone better.
Threw one of 'em off a mountain, one into a ragin' river.
So, they've all been destroyed?
- Well, we were about to destroy them, but...
- What?
You didn't kill them? You call yourself Tengu warriors? You're more like Tengu turkeys!
I'll have you all stuffed and roasted!
But, master, there was this monster with these huge sticks and it kept twirling them...
Sticks? Did these sticks have a whistling sound?
It was more like nails on a chalkboard.
Dulcea.
That miserable, manipulating, loathsome she-devil of a witch!
If she leads them to the great power, everything will be ruined.
- Do you want us to take another whack at it?
- How about takin' another quack at it?
No time to waste. My Ecto-Morphicon machines must be unearthed by sundown.
It's time.
BILLY: Man, this jungle goes on for ever.
TOMMY: We've gotta keep movin', guys.
Zordon's time is runnin' out.
Dad!
Dad!
Hey, Dad!
Dad, what's wrong with you?
It's me - Fred.
Dad, we gotta get outta here!
Hey, you!
Get back to work!
PIG: Yeah! Pick up those rocks!
Tote that barge! Lift that bale!
GOLDAR: Put your weak backs into it!
PIG: Yeah, I had a weak back about a week back.
Feast your eyes on the exoskeleton of the Barbaric Hornitor!
The Dreaded Scorpitron should be close by.
Once my lovely little Ecto-Morphicon machines are up and running, spreading ooze throughout the world,
I shall annihilate Angel Grove, and then... the universe!
PIG: # We're takin' over the world!
We're takin' over the world #
- AISHA: What is this place?
- BILLY: Looks like some kind of graveyard.
- KIMBERLY: I wonder what happened.
- ADAM: Personally, I'd rather not find out.
- Welcome to Jurassic Park.
- AISHA: Very funny, Adam.
TOMMY: Aisha, get outta there!
Rocky!
Uh-oh.
Wait for me!
- Tommy!
- Hang on!
Tommy!
All right, bonehead!
- Tommy, hang on!
- Whoa! Whoa!
Tommy!
Whoa!
Hold on tight, Tommy!
Yo, fossil head!
I've got a bone to pick with you!
Huh? Whoa!
Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Biology finally paid off for you, huh?
We should get outta here before he pulls himself together.
Yeah.
GOLDAR: You there! Let's show a little initiative! And you, get your rear in gear!
Pick up the pace! We haven't got all day!
- Hey, boss, construction is completed.
- PIG: Yeah, when's lunch?
Parents of Angel Grove!
You have completed my Ecto-Morphicons!
But, frankly, I'm sick of your ugly faces and your dull personalities.
- Yeah!
- (giggles/snorts)
You will return to the construction site and leap to your doom.
- Leap to your doom.
- Bye-bye.
- GOLDAR: Bye-bye!
- GOLDAR: Aloha!
GOLDAR: Arrivederci!
- Dad!
- IVAN: Hasta la vista, baby.
GOLDAR: See ya! Wouldn't wanna be ya!
Ciao.
See ya later, alligator.
Finally, the moment of truth!
Mordant, let the ooze flow!
Comin' right up.
Ooze, give my creatures life!
Life, I tell you! Life!
Excellent!
Now my machines will destroy the city!
ADAM: Wow.
Hey, guys, check this out.
BILLY: lncredible.
Let's go, guys. Nice and easy.
What do you think?
Wait here.
Tommy!
- What now?
- Ninjetti!
- Falcon!
- The frog!
- The ape!
- The crane!
- The wolf!
- Bear!
These things are made of rock.
These guys are strong.
Yikes.
Back off, boulder breath!
Hang tight, Adam!
Ever play leapfrog?
- Adam!
- Hang on, Rocky!
Hey, lava head!
Thanks, Adam. Thought I was finished.
That's one down, and three to go.
Whoa!
Somebody help!
Let's talk about this.
Guess not.
Come on, roll!
Hang on, Kimberly!
They're strong, but they're not too smart.
Help me push.
Right.
KIMBERLY: Let's rock his world.
What is this, pick-on-the-frog day?
- Hey, Adam, could you use a hand?
- The thought crossed my mind.
Adam!
Elevator goin' up.
BILLY: Elevator goin' down.
Talk about a splitting headache.
Whoa! That was close.
- All right. Ready?
- Yeah.
Go!
Ninjetti corkscrew kick!
Eightball, corner pocket!
What now?
- Whoa. What's happening?
- TOMMY: Look.
The great power.
The sacred animals.
ROCKY: New Zords!
- We did it!
- Our morphers are on line.
- We got the power!
- Hang on, Zordon!
- We're on our way.
- Let's do it.
DULCEA: Good luck, Rangers.
Citizens of Angel Grove, how do you like my friends, huh?
The boys are back in town!
Long live the King of Ooze!
The mayor has declared a state of emergency.
He"s asked that the city be immediately evacuated.
Angel Grove has never before known...
Aye-yai-yai-yai-yai! Ivan's evil machines are destroying Angel Grove!
Alpha... keep trying.
TV: Where are the Power Rangers?
I love the smell of destruction in the evening.
Me, too.
What's that smell?
Inconceivable.
The Power Rangers!
- Oh, man! Look at this mess.
- This is lvan's handiwork.
- Let's get back to the command centre.
- Wait. What was that?
I think we're about to find out. Look!
- Whoa. What is that thing?
- lvan's been busy while we were away.
Whoa!
- What's that?
- AISHA: There's another one.
KIMBERLY: And it's even uglier.
- Whoa.
- We've gotta stop these things.
- We've got new Ninja Zords. Let's use 'em!
- Right!
Ninja crane Zord!
Ninja wolf Zord!
Ninja frog Zord!
Ninja ape Zord!
Ninja bear Zord!
Ninja falcon Zord!
GOLDAR: Uh-oh!
- Check it out!
- Ninja Zords!
Cool!
- Yes!
- Awesome!
Oh, no! It's the Zords!
Ah, Zords, schmords.
I'll crush 'em like roaches.
- Let's do it!
- Right! Ninja Zords power up!
Ready to ride. Yes!
- All systems on line.
- Activating weapon systems.
- Nice stereo.
- We're outta here!
(parents chanting) Leap to our doom.
Leap to our doom.
Leap to our doom.
# Uh-oh, we're in trouble #
# Something's come along and it's burst our bubble #
# Yeah, yeah #
Hey, everyone!
Listen up! You all think this is one big party, don't you?
- Yeah!
- Well, you've all been brainwashed.
Ivan's taking over the planet and he's using all of us in his plans!
- And he's got our parents.
- What are you talking about?
Look, lvan Ooze is evil.
And if you don't come with me right now, our parents are gonna die! You gotta believe me!
TOMMY: Rangers, I'm over the east quadrant.
My sensors are pickin' up a disturbance.
I'm goin' in.
Somebody call for an exterminator?
I've got a lock.
Rockets away!
I've been hit! I'm pullin' out!
Don't worry, Tommy, Frog Zord is in position.
We got 'em now, boss.
Touch me again, you'll be chicken wings in the morning.
ADAM: Tongue-tied and twisted.
Yee-hah!
Bad move, sparky.
You play with fire, you're gonna get burned.
- I need backup!
- BILLY: l"m on my way!
Wolf Zord approaching target.
Keep him tied up. I'm loading hydraulics.
ADAM: I'm losin' him!
Here goes!
All right! Got him.
Time to boogie with the bear.
Whoa!
I've been hit hard!
Ape Zord locked on target.
Yee-hah!
Ride 'em, cowboy!
- Hang in there, Rocky!
- I'm hangin'! I'm hangin'!
FRED: Come on! We'll take the monorail!
Let's get down to the construction site!
All right, guys,
I've got a lock on the ooze man.
Ah!
Here comes that cute little Pink Ranger to the rescue.
Oh, you think she's cute too, huh?
- One order of toasted slime comin' up.
- So, you wanna play, huh?
Ivan's got me in an electromagnetic deadlock!
I can't break free!
TOMMY: Hang on, Kimberly!
I'm getting airsick up here!
My stabilisers have ruptured!
I can't hold on much longer!
- I'm burning up in here!
- AISHA: Kimberly, use your thrusters!
Right! Now, which button?
Aaaaaggghhh!
- I'll deal with you later.
- Yeah, later.
Ah. Oozed.
I'm losing my grip!
I can't hold on much longer!
Falcon Zord is back in the game.
Adam, disengage. I've got a clear shot!
He's all yours.
All right, big guy, it's lights out for you.
Rockets away!
- He's outta there!
- Target neutralised. Let's get the other one.
He's too strong! I can't take him down!
Everybody close in. This street's a dead end.
IVAN: They've destroyed my beautiful creation.
Now I'm beginning to get really angry!
Oh, I'm gonna be sick.
IVAN: I feel big again!
Go get 'em, booger man!
Whoa. Somebody call a plastic surgeon.
Oh, no!
I'm outta here!
Time for a little swordplay.
- He destroyed the monorail track.
- We need Ninja Megazord power now!
Ninja Megazord, power up!
Monorail's in trouble.
I'll complete docking sequence later.
KIMBERLY: We"ll take care of lvan.
# Go, go, Power Rangers #
# Mighty Morphin Power Rangers #
Crane Zord locked on.
Checking out.
Ninja battle mode now!
- Activating Ninja Megazord battle mode.
- Power Sword, now!
Shall we tango?
- Oh, no.
- What is that?
- The track's broken!
- Oh, no!
Hang on, kids.
- Falcon Zord is comin' in for a landin'.
- Everybody hang on!
All right! Yeah! Whoo!
Good luck, kids.
Power Sword has been destroyed.
- Pressure's dropping!
- Negative control!
- Tommy, we need your help!
- Hang tight, guys. I'm on my way.
- Everybody hang on!
- IVAN: Next stop, Angel Grove First National.
Whoaaa!
ADAM: Brace for impact!
- All systems down!
- He's closing in!
- Tommy, get your butt down here!
- Comin' in to complete the sequence.
Ninja Falcon Megazord!
Let's get Ooze outta here before he destroys everything.
- I'll set a course for outer space.
- Good idea.
Let's do it!
You can run, but you can't hide.
Yee-hah!
(chanting) Leap to our doom.
Leap to our doom.
Leap to our doom.
Leap to our doom.
It's our parents!
You guys try and stop them.
And you two come with me.
- Guys, I think I know a way to get rid of lvan.
- Really? How?
- Ryan's Comet.
- Billy, that's brilliant!
- What?
- We get lvan in the comet's path...
And kaboom! He's space dust.
- All right, guys, main thrusters.
- Right!
- We can't hold 'em back!
- We have to keep on trying!
Turn it on!
Well, if it isn't that double-dealing dough head!
I hope those Rangers put that lousy lowlife out of my misery!
- Go, Rangers! Go, Rangers!
- Go, Rangers! Go, Rangers!
We're approaching the comet's coordinates.
All right, guys, this is it.
We'll wait here and lure him in.
I'm gonna rip you apart Zord by Zord.
TOMMY: Here he comes. Brace yourselves!
- Micropressure's in the red!
- We're imploding!
Bearing 009. We're in the comet's trajectory.
We need to break free.
IVAN: Have you hugged your Zords today?
- Here it comes!
- We have to break his grip!
Desperate times call for desperate measures.
- What are you doing?
- Taking care of business.
- We're outta here.
- Right!
Oh, no.
Yeah.
- Skull!
- Bulk...
Dad!
- Fred!
- Dad!
I love you, son.
Alpha!
Rangers, you made it!
But... I'm afraid you're too late.
BILLY: Too late?
This can't be happening.
Remember what we learnt?
To those who possess the great power, all things are possible.
Come on.
Zordon!
Rangers!
He's alive! He's alive! He's alive!
- We thought that you had...
- It is good to see you again, too.
- SKULL: We were awesome.
- BULK: lncredible!
Ivan and his 50-foot monsters had us surrounded.
- There was no escape.
- We knew we were facing death in the eye.
- We could smell death's breath.
- And death could use a mint.
Can you believe those guys?
I'm so hungry.
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Fred!
- Hey! Rumour has it you're quite the hero.
- That's my man!
I helped a bit.
The Power Rangers did most of the work.
Hey, things got tough, you didn't panic.
You, my friend, demonstrated true bravery.
It's like what you taught me about martial arts: use your head, and above all, stay calm.
I heard you're in line to be a Ranger yourself one of these days.
- Nah, that's impossible.
- Hey, anything's possible.
- You really think so?
- I know so.
- Fred Kelman, the Silver Ranger.
- It does have a certain ring to it.
Fred Kelman the Gold Ranger.
Check it out!
# We'll get higher and higher #
# Straight up we'll climb #
# We'll get higher and higher #
# Leave it all behind #
# So, baby, dry your eyes #
- All right!
- I don't believe it.
- Power Rangers?
- Bulk and Skull!
# Cos we belong #
# In a world that must be strong #
# Oh, that's what dreams are made of #
# Oh, that's what dreams are made of #
I am King Goldar, the ruler of the universe!
Uh-oh.

Well, go on then.
Hello.
{\An1}You bastards.
You steal my car.
You steal my car and leave me with this piece of shit.
{\An1}CAR OWNER: Listen, mate,

It's for you.
{\An1}CAR OWNER: Do you know who you're talking to, who you're dealing with here?
{\An1}Listen, mate, I'm gonna have you put away for this.
I'm gonna have you put down.
Do you realize how much that car cost?
{\An1}CAR OWNER:
Twenty-five grand.
{\An1}What do you think?
Seen better.
{\An1}I doubt it.
{\An1}So do you know how much a paint job costs on one of those?
What do you think?
{\An1}I think you're going to get us into a lot of trouble, Billy.
{\An3}Yeah.
Give it some juice, Billy.
Oh shit.
What is it?
{\An1}It's the police.
They've brought a fucking Transit van to a car chase.
Get him.

{\An1}Bad man's wagon, sir.

Nice? It's a BMW 325i, man.
Six cylinders,

Standing to sixty in less than seven seconds.
That is a class car.
{\An1}Oh well, I know,
I know.
{\An1}Switch your alarm off, dirty Kevin.
{\An1}Heard you had a run-in with the busies already.
Yeah, we saw some speed.
What about you?
Been busy. Bit of shopping, you know. Crash and carry.
{\An1}Be Bop?
{\An1}That's the car.
Real classic.
No shit.
{\An1}When you take the trims off, then with the black body underneath, when you turn the lights out, you're invisible.
This place is getting popular.
Yeah.
{\An1}Couple of lads are selling tickets to watch her.
Hey, do you know about Lenny?
No.
He hit a concrete post.
{\An1}Did he get hurt?
He got fucked.
Shit.
{\An1}You are about to witness the strength
{\an1}of the Be Bop.
Where's this car?
Ah, you're not real.
{\An1}I couldn't resist it.
Shut up!
Guess who's watching.
He's happy to see you back.
{\An1}Fuck him.
Tommy's been a big man while you've been away.
He's got half the kids here on his crew.
The police are on their way.
Stay where you are.
Stay where you are.
The police are...
Get out.
Fucking bastards.
Billy, come on let's go.
In a minute.
You're going the wrong way.
Hang on, we gotta go.
Come and get me, you bastards. I'm right here.
Come on, you bastards.
Come and get me.
{\An1}Come on.
What the hell were you doing, Billy?
When?
Why did you go back to the car?
{\An1}Good music's hard to find.
You're out of your fucking mind.
{\An1}You got a cigarette?
I thought you'd quit.
{\An1}No.
{\An1}I just stopped buying them.
{\An1}Camel. These will kill you.
I'll take the chance.
{\An1}How about going home?
{\An1}Pick up my stuff.
The old man's been looking after it.
{\An1}Right.
{\An1}Billy.
Welcome home.
Who is it?
{\An1}Who're you?
I live here.
Billy?
I'm Sarah.
Hello, Sarah.
Nice dressing gown.
My daddy?
No.
So can
I come in?
I'm sorry, Billy.
Come on.
He'd kill me if he knew.
{\An1}Where's my stuff?
He boxed it up.
Couple of days ago.
It's all in the caravan.
He didn't keep nothing.
He said he's had enough.
He's says you're a thief, Billy.
{\An1}Yeah?
{\An1}And what does he do?
{\An1}He sits on his fat arse and smokes all day.
{\An1}What the fuck does he know?
{\An1}He doesn't wanna see you messed up, Billy.
{\An1}No one does.
Welcome home.
{\An1}You think I'm ever going to tan, Billy?
You need time.
{\An1}See that?
{\An1}You ever been on a plane, Billy?
No.
You ever been abroad?
No.
I been to Durham.
{\An1}What's in Durham?
Prison.
Talk about Ireland.
{\An1}What do you wanna know?
Anything.
{\An1}All right.
Back home, what you do, they don't need prison.
They just kneecap you.
{\An1}Someone comes round in the middle of the night.
Gun to your knees and... bang!
I had a friend back there.
He was a real local hero.
Caught up with him eventually.
So?
{\An1}Two days later he was at a hospital,
{\an1}stealing cars with walking sticks.
One for the accelerator and one for the clutch.
{\An1}Do you want to know anything else?
{\An1}Yeah. What did he use for the brake? His dick?
That's not very funny, Billy.
{\An1}What?
{\An1}He's something special?
{\An1}He means something to you, Jo?
Not anymore.
{\An1} There's one car stolen every 60 seconds in this city.
{\An1} Now that's an epidemic and I think it's about time people realized it.
What are you doing about it?
What I can do. What
I'm allowed to do.
Do you need more prisons?
No, I don't need more prisons.
I don't need more police.
Certainly don't need more guns.
They're never the answer.
{\An1}INTERVIEWER: So what is the answer?
I'm just a policeman.
Don't ask me.
Got you, you fucker.
Nice shot.
{\An1}Nice hat,
Be Bop.
It's on loan.
What's that?
Is this the best you could do, Jo?
{\An1}What do you mean?
'Crazy Cars'. This is a fucking antique, Jo.
{\An1}Oh well,
I've never stolen an antique before.
You two want coffee?
That stuff is bad for you, Billy.
{\An1}You had a skateboard?
Very 80's.
Oh, lovely.
Who did you see inside?
Tig, Rick, Spencer... they're all there.
Like a fucking school reunion.
Oh man. I remember these.
Shut up.
You had worse.
Shit!
{\An1}Hey, look at this.
{\An1}A man with a dark past.
Duran, Spandau,
Twisted Sister.
Yeah all right.
Let's go.

{\an1}Kid's here.
So... you like the car then?
Yeah. Yeah, you did good. Here you go.
{\An1}What's this? There's 15 here. You said I'd get 30.
Shut up.
{\An1}Take the 15. And you take these for the rest.
No, I want money.
{\An1}Listen, you sell these, you'll make 50-60 notes easy.
{\An1}Take 'em.
And if you want any more, you talk to Pony here.
{\An1}Just call.
See ya.
Welcome back, Billy.
A single, please, Bev.
On the house.
{\An1}Thank you.
I saw the BMW, mate.
{\An1}STRANGER:
Yeah.
Yeah?
Why don't you grow up?
Eh?
And do what?
Come on, Jo.
{\An1}TOMMY: Jo...
Billy. Long time, mate.
{\An1}Fancy a little business?
No. Not interested.
{\An1}Fords are up.
Get you a good price.
Tommy, I don't work for you.
{\An1}You gotta watch him, T.
What?
{\An1}Billy. You wanna keep your eye on him.
What do you mean?
{\An1}Well, I'm just saying...
What are you just saying?
{\An1}You know...
What? What are you saying to me?
{\An1}Nothing. I ain't saying nothing.
What did you do, Pony?
And why did I kick you out?
You are a pusher, boy.
So get out and fucking push.
{\An1}So you're keeping those?
What?
{\An1}The shades from hell.
Sure.
{\An1}You got no taste, Jo.
Like you'd know.
{\An1}Here.
What's this?
{\An1}Have a look.
Thanks, Billy.
{\An1}I got it in your color.
{\An1}Just one thing.
{\An1}If it doesn't fit, don't...
Try taking it back.
{\An1}Where the fuck are you going?
Sunday school.
{\An1}You little fucker.
You be back by twelve.
{\An1}MRS TAYLOR: I'll be locking the door.
Bye, Mrs Taylor.
{\An1}MRS TAYLOR: Fuck off.
Nice one, your mother.
{\An1}Come on, lads, hurry up.
Pony...
{\an1}Dix, man, what you saying?
Cars are here, man.
{\An3}Yeah.
{\An1}Cars are in.
{\An3}Good
{\an1}Right. Tell the boys to turn up at Pilgrim Street.
{\An1}For what? There's no stores up there.
It's 'cause we're not going shopping, Dixie.
{\An1}So, what are we doing?
Taking care of competition, mate.
Give us a drag.
No, you're too young, Monkey.
How does it feel being a "sandbagger"?
A what?
A sandbag in the back.
{\An1}You know, in case the police start shooting, you catch the bullets.
Thanks, Jo.
{\An1}Don't worry, Monkey, they don't have guns.
Not yet.
{\An1}Booyakasha!
{\An1}Come on, Jack, you old tart.
Right you lot.
Let's do crime.
{\An1}Shut the fuck up, Pony.
Always look for the telegraph poles.
They run alongside you.
Whenever the road turns, there's another pole.
You look up, you see 'em, you know what's coming.
If you're gonna take it from a car park, look at the tickets.
People are mean.
{\An1}If they buy three hours, they'll be gone three hours.
Are you listening?
I had a Jag last night.
Bullshit man.
You couldn't steal a Tonka toy.
Shit.
Can you do that?
{\An1}Of course.
{\An1}You stole the Porsche, right?
{\An1}You swerve left, you hit the cones, and you smash the police car off the road.
Off the road?
{\An1}Got it?
Not really.
Now bring the noise
Everyone gets to be on TV.
Yeah.
King of beers.
{\An1}Prince of piss more like.
Now Guinness, there's a drink.
{\An1}I'll come back for that.
What's the matter with you two?
Don't you like fucking?
{\An1}That's none of your business.
{\An1}Besides, you don't get humped, you don't get dumped.
Ventilate them.
{\An1}Good night.
Thanks.
{\An1}JO: You're wasting your time.
Yeah?
She wasn't your type.
Jealous?
{\An1}Just worried you might catch something.
Oh yeah.
Rabies, perhaps.
You are jealous.
Not me.
Hey, look at that.
Wankers.
Me and Be Bop started like that.
I could never reach the pedals.
I used to tie blocks of wood to my shoes to give me a few extra inches.
{\An1}I remember the first time behind the wheel of a car.
The thrill of it.
I remember the speed.
I used to come here as a kid.
Used to get a buzz.
{\An1}Ya, ya, very thrilling, Billy.
You wanna see something?
{\An1}What?
You wanna see something?
{\An1}What is it?
Do you want to see something?
{\An1}All right then, show me.
Where you going, Billy?
Oh don't be stupid.
{\An1}You wanted to see something.
Well, not this.
{\An1}Catch.
Oh, fuck you.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Billy.
{\An1}Like every drug you ever did.
You stupid fuck.
Come on.
{\An1}Billy.
{\An1}Come on.
Billy.
You stupid fuck.
Here you are, Steve.
One fifty in the shops.
If you give me 40 each, you can have the lot.
Yeah.
{\An1}Don't know. Been getting a lot of heat recently.
{\An1}Two weeks old, man.
{\An1}Officer Dibble isn't even looking for these.
Can't do. I'd like to help but...
You know, things are tough.
{\An1}Yeah well, things are always tough, innit, Steve?
I'll tell you what.
Make it 25, I'll take the lot.
{\An1}No. They're worth 40.
I told you.
Things are hard.
40, Steve. Or it's not worth my time.
Sorry.
{\An1}I'll tell you what though.
I'll do you a favor.
{\An1}Thirty. Thirty quid.
Top offer.
{\An1}Don't give me that shit, Steve.
{\An1}Listen, man, you're really pissing me off.
I'm not going to take it.
{\An1}I'd rather dump the lot in the river than sell 'em for that.
Come on, Tommy.
{\An1}What do you mean,
"Come on Tommy"?
{\An1}You think I'm joking, do you?
You think I'm fucking about? Yeah?
30 quid. 30 quid for this mate?
30 quid. Look at that, look.
{\An1}Bollocks, mate. For
30 fucking quid.
All right.
All right.
Come on, man.
Take your fucking hands off me, you batty man.
It's only money, all right. Forty quid, done.
How many have we got?
What you fucking looking at?
How many are there?
Five.
{\An1}... Flagged
{\an1}Get yourself some decent clothes, all right?
Cute bag.
I've been watching you.
And?
Don't think much of your sales technique.
{\An1}Yeah, well. I run this place, Jo.
Sure you do.
Yeah.
{\An1}On the streets, people want things, they come to me.
{\An1}Videos, TVs, hi-fi, cigarettes, you name it.
{\An1}I'm the man.
Of course, you are.
{\An1}You don't understand, do you, Jo? You know what it's like.
{\An1}The shopkeepers think we are scum.
{\An1}No one gives you credit.
No one rents to you.
{\An1}Not me. I supply.
These little people, they can't live without me.
Oh please.
{\An1}You should get organized, Jo... Yeah?
{\An1}You want something? Take it.
{\An1}It is fuck or be fucked.
A philosopher?
{\An1}Got contacts, you know.
{\An1}I can make you some serious money, girl.
I'll think about it.
{\An1}You're wasting your time.
You know that, don't you?
{\An1}With Billy.
{\An1}I know him, man, he's a fucking freak.
{\An1}Adrenalin junkie.
I get my thrills.
{\An1}Yeah, it won't last.
{\An1}He's not as good as he thinks.
Anything can happen in the next half hour.
How do you feel?
Dilated.
Jo, do we have to?
I was going to sleep today.
{\An1}All day?
Yeah.
Why not?
There's fuck all else to do.
And now I have to watch that shit all day.
Stingray.
Oprah Winfrey.
Sesame Street.
Oh, great.
I think I've given myself brain damage.
I'm surprised you can tell.
Shit.
{\An1}You should get a new one.
Thank you.
Oh, great.
What is it?
Fashion patrol.
Make yourself at home.
Couple of stores got hit last night, Billy.
I only just got out.
You know that. You came to see me off, remember?
You have anything to do with it?
No.
What about these?
{\An1}Presents.
You can prove it, can you?
I don't have to.
Not yet.
{\An1}Look,
I know my rights.
I watch L.A. Law.
Is that supposed to be funny?
{\An1}No.
More comedy drama, you know what I mean?
{\An1}He doesn't need your help.
{\An1}Cigarette?
I never touch low tar.
Look at this rubbish.
You even steal trash.
{\An1}Oh, fuck you.
What?
{\An1}How long have
I known you, Billy?
{\An1}Since you were what... Nine, ten?
I don't remember.
Why do you do it, Billy?
You don't keep anything.
You don't have anything.
{\An1}You like being in prison, is that it?
{\An1}Makes you a big man with your mates?
No.
Why do you do it?
One last time.
Did you have anything to do with those shops?
Yeah.
{\An1}I've got a pile of TV's under the bed.
Have a look.
{\An1}Fridge under the table. Microwave...
{\an1}Food mixer.
Oi...
{\an1}Oi... Do you want a suit?
{\An1}Polyester.
Captain Polyester.
I'll get you a new tie.
How about that?
Something nice. Natural fibers.
What's that?
{\An1}The size of his dick.
{\An1}Look at this place.
Come on, Billy.
Let's go.
{\An1}Fucking bastard.
{\An1}MONKEY: Ford Granada, latest model.
{\An1}Wankers drive it straight into a wall.
{\An1}Waste of a fucking good car, that is.
{\An1}BE BOP: It was the police that did it, Monkey.
{\An1}But we'll have them back down here.
{\An1}We'll show them not to fuck with us.
Yeah. We'll show
'em, eh, Billy?
Maybe.
{\An1}Maybe tonight.
We're closing up.
This used to be a beautiful little shop.
What happened?
{\An1}People kept driving cars into it.
So we're going to do it?
Come on. Look at the place.
Maybe if we had guns.
No.
{\An1}Anyway, Tommy's doing the Alaska tonight.
I thought we might check it out.
You're asking for trouble, Billy.
{\An1}What else is there?
Look at this place.
{\An1}How do people live in this filth?
Hello, Mr. Venning.
Very nice of you to make a house call.
You have my stuff?
Upstairs.
{\An1}I'd watch that motor, if I were you.
{\An1}There's a lot of bloody thieves around here.
Did you get a scanner?
No sweat.
Nice.
I'll see you there.
{\An1}You live in this place?
Yeah, me and a few others.
We're just one big happy family.
{\An1}This place is a disgrace.
You did all right out of it.
Laurent.
This is good.
{\An1}Yeah, I know.
So where's the rest?
{\An1}Still in the store.
You tell me what you want and I'll get it for you.
{\An1}No fuss, no waste.
How much?
Eighty, your jacket.
I'll do fifty.
{\An1}Man, no deals.
{\An1}See how much it sells for in the shops.
Five hundred.
{\An1}You're gonna get one-fifty for them, at least.
Doesn't work like that.
Come on, son.
Fifty quid for the jacket.
It's easy money.
Fuck.
Fucking people, man.
Easy money.
That's what you make.
I take risks.
I earn my money.
What d'you do for yours?
Now I told you.
I want eighty.
I don't need 'em.
Not for that price.
{\An1}You're not the only supplier.
{\An1}I could walk out of that door right now and find a dozen like you.
Right there on the street.
Yeah? Go on then.
{\An1}They're cowboys.
They'll fuck it up.
So I'll use another.
What does it matter to me?
{\An1}Because I get what you want. Guaranteed.
{\An1}I'm the best.
And you know it.
All right, boy.
We'll have a deal, you and me.
Sixty a jacket.
{\An1}Sixty-five.
Sixty.
{\An1}Okay.
{\An1}Pony...
{\an1}Pony.
{\An1}Take the man's order.
{\An1}We'll deliver tonight.
{\An1}The Alaska won't know what hit it.
Any sign of Tommy?
I'll take a look.
Bang.
How's it look?
Fragile. What're you doing?
{\An1}I'm driving.
Drive this.
{\An1}I get the message.
Nice driving.
An emergency is in progress.
Please evacuate the building.
An emergency is in progress.
It's raining.
Tobago.
There is an emergency in the building.
Please evacuate the building.
{\An1}Jo, look at this.
Ninety for a kettle.
{\An1}I can't believe people pay that much.
Oh, come on, Billy.
Stop playing house.
Ninety!
{\An1}Yay, cigarettes.
Dispatch to all cars.
{\An1}Shit. Wait a second.
Dispatch to all cars.
{\An1}I've got something.
That's us.
{\An1}They'll be here in a minute.
{\An1}You hear what I said?
{\An1}Yes.
Well, come on.
Just a second.
{\An1}Hurry up.
Oh shit.
What?
They never have my size.
Let's fucking go.
There got it.
Shit.
Fucking animals.
Fucking animals.
Fucking animals.
Fucking animals.
Fucking animals.
Fucking animals.
No.
Come on. Come on.
Get me out of here, Billy.
Let's ditch the bitch.
Fuck.
Where've you been, Pony?
Really sorry.
Fuck that.
Just go out and get 'im.
Move it.
Ain't you heard?
Oh for fuck's sake, here we go.
What Pony? What haven't I heard?
{\An1}The Alaska's been done.
Volvo straight for the window.
What?
Yeah. There's busies everywhere.
That store was mine, man.
Fucking you, that store was mine.
{\An1}What am I going to tell Venning, man.
What am I going to tell Venning?
Which bastard was it?
Word has it,
Billy McKenzie.
He's led the busies up from the estate.
There's a bunch of kids up there and they trashed 'em.
He's an 'ero. He's a fucking hero now.
Yeah, all right, he's a wanker.
{\An1}Fucking dead, that's what he is.
Aren't you forgetting something?
{\An1}BILLY: What?
Your kettle.
{\An1}Thank you.
Fucking antique.
Tires were flat.
We just leavin' it?
{\An1}Fuck no.
Oh man, look at this.
{\An1}Yeah, wonderful, Monkey.
Just like home.
{\An1}Who says you can't buy happiness?
That all depends on where you shop, Billy.
{\An1}Kettle's great.
It's an Alessi. Worth every penny.
Perhaps you should have got some cups as well.
{\An1}Yeah, maybe next time.
Maybe next time you can do without the riot.
That place was a fucking nightmare.
Fuck.
Billy.
Fuck.
Billy!
{\An1}Billy.
{\An1}Billy.
Fuck him. Billy...
Where the fuck are you?
Fuck him.
Think I pissed him off?
Where's my van?
Where the fuck is my van?
Where we going anyway?
Place I know.
It's not far.
I don't know why you and Tommy don't just get a life.
{\An1}See who's got the biggest dick and save us all this trouble.
{\An1}Jesus Christ.
{\An1}How'd you find this place?
I used to crash here when the old man used to lock me out.
{\An1}I can see why.
{\An1}Little boys love their train sets.
{\An1}All mod cons.
{\An1}Going to be okay here?
Yeah, sure.
Safer than some hostel.
Cleaner too.
Pigs in space.
{\An1}It's getting too hard, Billy.
I like it hard.
{\An1}It's time to move on.
Yeah.
I fancy...
The Bahamas, myself.
Maybe Miami.
{\An1}I'm being serious.
If they catch you again...
They won't.
Bullshit.
What, you think
I wanna go back?
You think I wanna go back to prison?
No I don't.
It scares the shit out of me.
Then why don't we just go?
Pick up a car and get the fuck out.
I can't do that.
Why not?
Look around you, Billy.
You got nothing left here.
You got nothing to stay for.
What's the point?
There's nowhere better than this.
{\An1}How do you know?
You haven't seen anything.
I can show you places, Billy.
Billy.
I'm not like you, Jo.
{\An1}Yes you are.
You're just like me.
This is my home.
{\An1}I've seen a dozen towns like this.
{\An1}I grew up in a town like this and it's nothing special.
It is to me.
Why? Because you got a reputation?
You've got what you want, Billy.
You're the best. You're better than Tommy.
{\An1}They all know it. You've got nothing to prove.
We could get out.
Just you and me.
{\An1}We could get something going.
{\An1}Jo, we've got something going right here. The cars.
They aren't enough, Billy.
Not for me. Not anymore.
I'm 22. I'm an old woman.
I stole cars at school.
I'd take them over at break.
Leave it parked outside the gates.
And at the end of the day,
I was the only kid to drive home.
I was a fucking hero.
You know what that felt like?
It felt like I was somebody.
You're somebody to me.
Come on, Jo...
This is the 90's.
Sex isn't safe anymore.
Where you going?
To bed.
{\An7}Jo.
{\An7}Jo.
{\An7}Jo.
{\An1}So how's the cowboy?
Camping under the stars?
What do you want?
{\An1}I frightened you this morning, didn't I, Jo?
A bit.
A bit?
{\An1}It costs me, Jo.
I don't do this for fun, you know. This is business.
{\An1}Big money business.
{\An1}I don't need more filth on the streets.
{\An1}I don't need the fuckin' headache.
It's not my problem, Tommy.
It could be.
{\An1}Now you talk to him.
{\An1}You keep your fool under control.
{\An1}You wear all these, do you?
They hide the damp.
{\An1}You could do a lot better than this, you know.
I've seen your shitehole of a place.
{\An1}You know, I need to be where it's at.
{\An1}Stay close to the talent.
I'm not going to be there for ever.
{\An1}You and me, Jo...
{\an1}We don't stay in places like this. We get out.
{\An1}You know it.
You just gonna play with that thing, or are you gonna use it?
You touch me again and I'll bite your face off.
{\An1}Yeah.
{\An1}I'm sure you would.
That place was fucking Fort Knox, man.
Tommy whipped the shit out of it.
You should have been there, Billy. You should have seen...
{\an1}Monkey, shut up.
{\An1}It's nothing.
{\An1}If he wants to see something, we show him.
{\An1}Right, Jo?
I bet she's got one too.
Look at them.
The living dead.
What the hell are we doing here, Billy?
Window shopping.
We're gonna show
Tommy something.
Oh for Christ's sake, will you forget Tommy?
{\An1}Jo, we've got to show him who's best.
Bullshit, Billy. You're not a kid any more.
{\An1}Yes, mother.
I'm not your fucking mother.
Where's Jo?
{\An1}I thought she was with you.
What do you think?
This place?
This is something.
This is one big fucker.
{\An1}Might be too big.
What do you mean?
{\An1}I mean they've got reinforced glass.
{\An1}They got shutters, they got cameras, they got alarms.
{\An1}Big alarms, Billy.
So?
{\An1}So why do it?
Because nobody else has.
Makes sense.
Jo?
Jo?
{\An1}Billy?
{\An1}Nice neighborhood.
Hello, Billy.
{\An1}TOMMY: Remember this place, do you?
What do you want?
{\An1}You've been sniffing around that big mall.
What mall, Tommy?
{\An1}No, man.
Don't fuck with me.
{\An1}You owe me, remember?
Is that right?
{\An1}Yeah.
{\An1}That's right. Every time, man, you played a hero, I paid a price.
So?
So, if you do that mall,
{\an1}I'm in.
{\An1}I'm not asking you,
Billy.
{\An1}Think about it, man.
Once you're through them big doors, the place is wide open.
{\An1}No protection.
{\An1}You can't take it all, man.
{\An1}I'm giving you a chance to make it up to me.
{\An1}So don't shit in my face.
{\An1}Come on, Billy, man.
Get yourself set up. Earn yourself some money.
You're not giving me a choice.
{\An1}There you go.
That's the idea.
I'll tell you tomorrow, Tommy.
{\An1}As long as you tell me "yes".
{\An1}Pony, take the boy home.
I can walk.
{\An1}What do you think?
I think he's full of shit.
Think he's going to do it tonight?
Yeah.
{\An1}Give me a phone.
What you doing?
{\An1}If Billy won't share...
He's no use to us, is he?
I saved you one.
You're not coming, are you?
There's no point, Billy.
Don't go.
I mean, fuck, Jo.
Fuck.
Come on, you and me.
{\An1}I'm out of here,
Billy. It's over.
So that's it then?
{\An1}You can come with me, you know.
{\An1}We'll get out tonight.
And do what?
{\An1}There's more than this town.
There's more than you and
Tommy and the rest of them.
{\An1}Just forget Tommy.
{\An1}Just let it go.
How can I?
I can't let him get away with this.
Just once more.
Something special.
Something to show him who's best.
Something to remember us by.
It's all set, Jo.
It's just sitting out there waiting for us.
One last hit.
Come on.
Feel the force.
{\An1}Last time for you?
It's gonna be the best.
Fucking Holy Grail,
I promise.
Hey, Billy...
Are we late?
No way.
The shops stay closed for another eight hours.
{\An1}I've got these for the cameras.
What about Tommy?
He's a wanker.
What can I say?
I heard you talked.
Yeah. He wanted in on tonight.
And?
I said I'll tell him tomorrow.
{\An1}Nice one.
Yeah... let's do it.
What do you think?
{\An1}Take some weight, yeah?
We'll get the speed.
All right.
{\An1}Got it.
What do you think?
{\An1}If we're going to do this, Billy, let's do it right.
Now, this is more like it.
That is one big mother.
{\An1}Yeah.
We're the first.
{\An1}Do you think we'll get our faces on TV?
Breakfast, daytime, prime time.
{\An1}Yeah, well, I hope they get my best side.
{\An1}You don't have one.
All right.
Let's saddle up.
{\An1}Do you really think he believed you?
Who?
{\An1}Tommy...
About tonight.
{\An1}There could be anything down there, you know.
Jo.
That's the fun of it.
When we're in, you take care of the cameras.
Don't worry,
I'm on it.
Michael Jackson, king of pop.
What do you think?
Always wanted to be black.
Dream on, man.
Silent running, Billy.
Hear anything?
Not a whisper.
Wicked.
Hold on, Monkey, we're about
{\an1}BE BOP: to do some shopping.
Now.
Jesus.
Jesus Christ.
Get us out of here, Billy.
Fucking bastard.
Shit.
Let's go. Let's go.
{\An1}All units, I'll meet you on the ground.
Bye bye, Billy.
Where are we?
Loading bay.
Under the stores.
Did we lose them?
I don't know.
Did you see Be Bop and Monkey?
I saw them, Billy.
Oh shit.
I've never seen so many police.
Something to remember us by.
{\An1}Isn't that what you said, Billy?
You hear anything?
No.
All right.
Hang on. Wait a second.
They've found us.
Here it comes.
You don't have to do it, Billy.
We could just get out now.
We could just walk away.
Just walk away?
He's not going to stop.
Get out of the fucking way.
Yeah.
{\An1}Yes.
{\An1}We got them.
Billy.
That looks fabulous.
Thank you, Geoffrey.
We'll also take a bottle of red as well.
Thank you.
Thank you, Barry.
That looks wonderful. Beautiful day.
Where are you going?
- To eat my sandwich.
- You won't be hungry for prawns.
- I don't like prawns.
- Darling, don't wander off.
For God's sake, leave her alone, Deirdre.
- Go play with your ball.
- Don't be so annoying!
Darling...
...what about snakes?
There aren't any snakes on the beach.
Just let her enjoy herself for once.
Edward?
Hello, there.
What are you, a little bird or something?
Are you hungry? Take a bite.
It's roast beef.
It's good. Come on. I won't hurt you.
Mummy! Daddy! Come see this!
I found something!
Cathy, darling, lunch is ready!
Are you looking at this?
I'm afraid there isn't enough to go around.
Paul?
Cathy?
Will you hurry up? Hurry up!
You're him, right?
Excuse me?
The scientist? The guy? I saw you on TV.
I believed you.
Who shall I tell Mr. Hammond is calling?
Ian Malcolm. I've been summoned.
Dr. Malcolm!
Hello, Dr. Malcolm.
Kids, kids.
- It's so great to see you.
- It's so great to see you.
Look at you.
You came to see Grandpa?
Yeah, he called me.
Do you know what it's about?
I don't, either.
This joint's kind of creepy, isn't it?
Is everything okay?
Well, not exactly.
Dr. Malcolm.
Dr. Malcolm. Here to share a few campfire stories with my uncle?
Convince the Washington Post and Sceptical Inquirer of what you want...
...but I was there.
I know what happened and so do you.
Do you believe everyone who chose discretion did so...
...for a nefarious motive?
Even Lex and Tim?
Leave them out of it. It's not a game.
No. You signed a nondisclosure agreement before you went to the island...
...that forbade you from discussing what you saw. You violated that agreement.
I did. And you lied about the deaths of three people.
You misinformed the public, which made me look like a nut.
Not so good for my career-
We made a generous compensatory offer for your injuries.
A payoff and an insult.
When you spin reality, cover up evidence, it hurts more than my reputation.
As I recall...
...your university revoked your tenure for your selling wild stories to the press.
I didn't sell anything.
I took no money and I told the truth.
Your version of it.
There are no " versions" of the truth.
InGen can't keep spewing out-
InGen is my responsibility.
I will jealously defend its interests.
Yours? What about Mr. Hammond?
It is our board of directors I must face, not my uncle.
Trust me, your problems are about to be rendered moot.
In a few weeks' time, they'll be long forgotten.
Not by me.
Careful.
This suit cost more than your education.
You were right and I was wrong. There!
Did you ever expect to hear me say such a thing?
Thank God for Site B.
Site B?
Isla Nublar was just a showroom for tourists.
Site B was the factory floor.
Isla Sorna, 80 miles from Nublar.
We bred the animals there, nurtured them for a few months...
...then moved them into the park.
Really? I did not know that.
After the accident in the park...
...Hurricane Clarissa wiped out our facility on Site B.
Call it an act of God.
We had to evacuate.
The animals were released...
...to mature on their own.
" Life will find a way," as you once so eloquently put it.
By now we have a complete ecological system on the island...
...with dozens of species living in social groups...
...without fences, boundaries or constraining technology.
And for four years...
...I've tried to keep it safe from human interference.
Right. Hopefully, you've kept the island quarantined and contained.
But I'm in shock.
I mean, that they're still alive.
You bred them lysine-deficient.
Shouldn't they have kicked after seven days without supplemental enzymes?
But, by God, they're flourishing.
That's one of 1,000 questions
I want the team to answer.
Team?
I've organised an expedition to go in...
...thank you, and document them.
To make the most spectacular living fossil record the world has ever seen.
Go in and document?
You mean with people?
Yes, the animals won't know they're there.
Very low impact.
Strictly observation and documentation.
Our satellite infrareds show the animals are fiercely territorial.
The carnivores are isolated in the interior of the island...
...so the team can stay on the outer rim.
Don't worry.
I'm not making the same mistakes again.
No, you're making all new ones.
John! So, there's another island with dinosaurs...
...no fences this time, and you want to send people in...
...very few people, on the ground, right?
Who are the four lunatics you're trying to con into this?
It was hard to convince them of what they would see...
...in the end had to use my chequebook.
But there's Nick van Owen, a video documentarian...
...Eddie Carr, who's a field equipment expert.
We have our palaeontologist...
...and I was hoping that perhaps you might be the fourth.
We've been on the verge of Chapter 11 since that accident in the park.
There are those in the company who wanted to exploit Site B...
...in order to bail us out.
They've been planning it for years, but I've stopped them until now.
A few weeks ago, a British family on a yacht cruise...
...stumbled across the island and their wee girl was injured.
She's fine.
But the board has used the incident to take control of InGen from me.
Now it's only a matter of time before this...
...lost world is found and pillaged.
Public opinion is the one thing I can use to preserve it, but to rally that support...
...I need a complete photo record...
...of those animals alive in their natural habitat.
So you went from capitalist to naturalist in just four years.
That's something.
It's our last chance at redemption.
John...
...no.
Of course, no.
And I'm going to contact the other three members of your team...
...and stop them from going.
Who's the palaeontologist, by the way?
She came to me, I want you to know.
Who did?
Leave it to you, Ian, to have associations...
...even liaisons with the best people in so many fields.
Not Sarah.
Palaeontological behaviour study is a new field, and Sarah Harding is on that frontier.
Her theories on parenting and nurturing in carnivores have framed the debate.
- What are you doing?
- Where's your phone?
It's too late.
She's already there.
The others are meeting her in three days.
You sent my girlfriend to this island alone?
" Sent" is hardly the word.
She couldn't be restrained.
She was already in San Diego, doing research at the animal park.
It's only a few hours' flight from there.
She was adamant, absolutely adamant about, here you are...
...about making the initial foray by herself.
She thinks she's Dian Fossey.
" Observation without interference," she said. You know how it is.
After you were injured in the park, she sought you out.
Then she went all the way to a hospital in Costa Rica...
...to ask someone she didn't know if the rumours were true.
If you want to leave your name on something, fine.
But stop putting it on other people's headstones.
She'll be fine. She's spent years studying African predators.
Sleeping downwind and all.
She knows what she's doing.
And, believe me, the research team will-
It's not a research expedition anymore.
It's a rescue operation and it's leaving now.
I can't shave three days off my deadline and expect to be ready.
I'm not supplied.
I haven't tested any of this.
Why give her a satellite phone if it doesn't work?
Could be solar flares, the satellite, or maybe she turned it off.
I need half air on the tires.
We're flying pressurised.
- Does she know how to use it?
- You kidding?
She's faxed me refinements on half the plans for this stuff.
Don't do that. You have to baby it.
Love it.
- I'll love it when it works.
- It'll work when you love it.
- You coming along?
- I don't usually, but I can't resist.
Thanks for the two-minute warning.
Nick van Owen, Ian Malcolm.
Nick's our photographer.
How do you do?
- You do wildlife photography?
- Wildlife, combat, you name it.
When I was with Nightline,
I was in Rwanda, Chechnya, Bosnia.
I do volunteer work for Greenpeace once in a while.
What drew you to Greenpeace?
Women.
Greenpeace is 80-percent female.
Noble.
Noble was last year.
This year I'm getting paid.
Hammond's check cleared, or I wouldn't go on this wild-goose chase.
You're going to the only place where the geese chase you.
Dad! Dad!
Kelly, honey, you found it.
What took you so long?
Couldn't get a cab.
Sweetie, that's okay.
I've got to tell you something.
- I don't even know this woman.
- You've known Karen for 10 years.
She doesn't have Sega.
She's such a troglodyte.
Cruel, but good word use.
Why can't I stay with Sarah?
She's out of town. Karen's fantastic.
She'll take you places.
You'll have a fantastic time.
Stop saying "fantastic. "
Where are you going?
It's only for a few days.
I wouldn't be going if it wasn't important.
I'm your daughter full time. You can't abandon me whenever opportunity knocks.
That hurts. Your mom tell you to say that?
Dr. Malcolm, downstairs, please.
I know we've had some hard going.
But in the last few years, we've started to work things out.
Yeah, but crack on me a bit. Ground me or something. Send me to my room.
You never do any of that stuff.
Why would I? You turned out so...
...beautiful, brilliant, powerful, funny and generous.
The queen, goddess. My inspiration.
Dr. Malcolm.
I could come be your research assistant, like in Austin.
This is nothing like Austin.
Anyway, you have your own stuff.
Your gymnastics competition.
You've been training for months.
Gymnastics?
I scrubbed out, got cut from the team.
Thanks for knowing.
I'm sorry, honey.
I know how much that meant to you.
You like having kids.
You just don't want to be with them.
It wasn't me who dumped you and split for Paris, so don't take it out on me.
Dr. Malcolm, downstairs!
Honey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
You want some good parental advice?
Don't listen to me.
How are we doing here?
The specs say it can't deform at 12,000 PSl, so we'll test it.
- Let's clear. We clear?
- What's this?
A high hide.
A high hide.
You know, you go up and hide, high.
It goes up to where the trees are and keeps the researchers out of harm's way.
Actually, it puts them at a very convenient biting height.
Do you have the time?
- Why?
- We're leaving in three hours.
This is so cool.
Lindstradt air rifle.
Fires a subsonic Fluger dart.
- It work better than your satellite phone?
- Funny.
I loaded it with enhanced venom from
Conus purpurascens: South Sea cone shell.
Most powerful neurotoxin in the world.
Acts within 0.002 of a second.
Faster than nerve-conduction velocity.
So the animal's down before it even feels the dart.
- Is there an antidote?
- Like if you shot yourself in the foot?
Don't do that.
You'd be dead before you realised it.
He says he's unloading us here.
He won't go further up the river.
He's heard too many stories.
He'll drop us off and anchor offshore.
What kind of stories?
Stories of fishermen that came too close to the island and never returned.
He has a radio. He has a satellite phone.
When you need him, call and he'll be here in two hours.
But he will not stay here.
He won't stay anywhere near these islands.
They call the islands " Las Cinco Muertes"?
What does that mean?
" The Five Deaths"...
...he says.
I put a location sensor in Dr. Harding's phone, so we should get a reading.
- I'm so relieved.
- Don't push my buttons.
We're almost on top of her dot.
She should be around here.
Over there.
Sarah!
Sarah Harding!
How many Sarahs do you think are on this island?
What?
Something big.
This is magnificent.
Yeah. " Ooh, ah," that's how it always starts.
But then later there's running and screaming.
Nick!
I guess you got the jump on us, didn't you, Sarah?
Yeah.
Ian, I never thought Hammond could get you to come here.
- Hi, Eddie.
- Hi, Sarah.
Got a granola bar or something?
I'm starving.
Did you see those animals?
A family group, a pair-bond and a subadult, long after the juvenile was nest bound.
Every egg clutch I've seen has crushed, trampled shells.
Hatchlings stay in the birth environment a long time. That's conclusive.
I can end that controversy if I get a shot of the nest.
Have you been attacked?
No, that's my lucky pack.
That's how it always looks.
Okay, Sarah-
Is that a Nikon? Can I borrow it?
I'll be right back, I promise.
When Hammond called you, why didn't you say something to me?
I knew you would have stopped me from coming.
I would have tied you to the bed.
- I know how they survived without lysine.
- I don't care.
The herbivore species that are thriving...
...eat mostly agama beans, soy, anything lysine-rich.
And the carnivores eat the herbivores, so...
Wait.
Stay there. Be quiet. I'll be back.
Stay there.
She's much too close.
- What is she doing?
- Too close.
She has to touch it. She can't not touch.
- She's going right up to it.
- Once she sees something, she has to...
Is this even possible?
What?
This? What did you think you'd document?
What did you think you'd see?
Animals. Maybe...
...big iguanas.
Fruitcakes.
He got very angry.
Shoot him!
They're protecting their baby.
So am I!
I think they're leaving.
Incredible. Guys shoot their whole life and never get stuff half this good.
Just give me the Pulitzer right now.
The competition's over, close the entries,
I'd like to thank everyone who lost.
Don't light that!
Dinosaurs pick up scents from miles away.
We're here to observe and document, not interact.
Which is a scientific impossibility.
Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.
What you study, you change.
I'll risk it. I'm sick of scratching around in rock and bone...
...making assumptions about the nurturing habits of animals...
...that have been dead for 65 million years.
Then you fill my head with stories.
Of course I came down here.
Stories of mutilation and death.
Were you paying attention?
Please! Don't treat me like a grad student.
I've worked around predators since I was 20.
Lions, jackals, hyenas, you.
Where's the fire?
I'm trying to change 100 years of entrenched dogma.
Dinosaurs were characterised early on as vicious lizards.
There's resistance to the idea of them as nurturing parents.
Robert Burke said the T. Rex was a rogue...
...who abandoned its young at the first opportunity. I can prove otherwise.
Fire! Dr. Malcolm, fire, base camp!
No! Water makes the smoke billow.
Use dirt!
Who started the fire?
I just wanted to make dinner.
I wanted it ready when you guys got back.
Do you see any family resemblance there?
You practically told me to come.
I... What?
You said, " Don't listen to me. "
I thought you were trying to tell me-
Kelly, you knew exactly what I meant.
You have no-
You want to lock her up for her curiosity?
Where do you think she gets it?
- Thank you, Sarah.
- Don't start the teaming-up thing.
Out of the conversation. Please. Really.
Eddie, why doesn't this thing ever work?
It's not a land line.
You're not in a phone booth.
Wait for a decent signal.
Violence and technology: not good bedfellows.
Hammond wants your equipment as close to the animals as possible.
Great idea. And why don't you smear on a little sheep's blood?
Eddie, is there any reason to think the radio in the trailer might work?
Don't tease me.
If you feel qualified, try flicking the switch to " on. "
Okay, I'm taking my daughter out of here.
Anyone coming with me, this is your last chance.
When you're out in the field...
Nick, if you're staying, I'll gladly deliver a letter to your wife or loved one...
...so you can say good-bye.
Eddie, if you have any personal effects...
...it's the least I can do.
I'll be in there, guys.
Our presence needs to be 100-percent antiseptic.
If we so much as bend a blade of grass...
- Dad, are you mad?
- No, I'm not mad. I'm furious.
This looks like your room.
- I was going to clean it up.
- Right now.
What is this? There are 100 switches!
Don't be mad. I was going to call to let you know where I was.
I always do, don't I?
I'm the best kind of girlfriend there is.
One who travels a lot. You like that.
You love your independence.
I've gotten used to being apart, but that's not how I want to live.
Kelly, this is tall talk. Just for a minute.
It's like a height restriction at an amusement park.
If you wanted to rescue me, why didn't you save me from...
...that museum fundraiser three weeks ago?
This is a slightly different situation.
What about the dinner with your parents you never showed up for?
Why not rescue me when I need it?
Be there when you say you will?
I have made a career out of waiting for you.
You know, she has a pretty good-
It's so important to your future that you not finish that sentence. Please, outside!
Ian, come on. Look.
I love that you rode in here on a white horse. I really do.
It's very touching, very dramatic.
I just need you to show up in a cab now and then, too.
What are you doing? Don't go out there.
It's not safe.
Stay in here. Come back. Shut the door.
I know what I'm doing.
You guys should definitely go.
But I'm staying.
I love you. I just don't need you right now.
What you need is a good anti-psychotic.
- I'll be back in five or six days.
- You'll be back in five or six pieces.
What bothers you is that I'm not afraid and you are.
Of course I am. That's the whole thing.
What's that sound?
I'll get you out on one of these right now.
Hello! Over here!
I don't get it.
It says InGen on the side of that chopper!
I don't get that.
Why would Hammond send two teams?
Cut the umbilical, Dad!
Doesn't he trust us?
We haven't even started.
This is as good a place as any for base camp.
That's first priority after we're finished.
I want it up and running in 30 minutes.
That's half an hour.
- Understood? Over.
- Cancel that order.
What? Why?
This is a game trail.
Carnivores hunt on game trails.
You want to set up base camp or a buffet?
Let's find a new spot, shall we?
Over and out.
Peter, if I run your little camping trip, there are two conditions.
First, I'm in charge.
If I'm not around, Dieter is.
You just pay us, tell us we're doing well, and serve us Scotch after a good day.
Second, my fee. You can keep it.
All I want for my services, is the right to hunt a Tyrannosaurus.
A male. A buck only.
How and why are my business.
If you don't like those conditions, you're on your own.
So go ahead, set up base camp here, in a swamp, or in the middle of a Rex nest.
I've had too many safaris with rich dentists to listen to any more suicidal ideas.
Okay?
Cycle, break off the stray from the herd and flush him to the right.
Snaggers, stay ready.
He's bringing them out to you. It'll be a...
...Pachy... Pachya... Oh, hell.
The fat head with the bald spot.
Friar Tuck.
Stop.
Pachycephalosaurus.
Carnivore?
No, herbivore, late Cretaceous.
See the distinctive domed skull?
Nine inches of solid bone. Now, careful.
A pachy's neck attaches at the bottom of its skull, not at the back of its head.
When it lowers its head, its neck lines up with its backbone...
...which is perfect for absorbing impact.
Snagger, Friar Tuck's on the loose, just about to cross your path.
Dieter, get in the outrigger.
You're closing in on a carina...
Say that again, Roland. A what?
The one with the big red horn.
The pompadour. Elvis.
Take me out.
Okay, Carter, reel me in.
Easy!
Not too close.
Go for the legs! The legs! Watch the tail!
Burke!
Come here.
Recognise this trackway?
Yes, I do. Tyrannosaur.
Roland.
Where do you think you're going?
To collect my fee, Mr. Ludlow.
To collect my fee.
Oh, my God.
Procompsognathus Triassicus, found by Frass in Bavaria in 1913.
Is it dangerous?
No, I wouldn't think so.
The Compy's been presumed to be a scavengers, like jackals.
It gives me the creeps.
It's like it's not scared.
There haven't been any visitors to this island.
There's no reason for it to fear man.
Now it does.
It's the Rex nest.
It's probably only a couple weeks old.
Never left the nest.
Offspring that young, the parents won't leave him alone for too long.
Make your blind here?
Wait for the buck to return?
If the nest is upwind, then so are we.
When he comes back, he's gonna know we're here without us having a chance.
The trick is to get him...
...to come where we want him.
This is why Hammond was in a hurry to get you here. He knew they were coming.
My God, they are well-organised.
Those are major-league toys.
Maybe I should ask to use their phone.
Their dish is bigger than yours.
So they actually want to build another park here?
After what you said happened on the other island?
They're not building anything.
They're taking these animals out of here.
Back to the mainland.
I think I should tell you. Hammond told me these people might show up.
He thought we'd be finished by the time they started, but if they weren't...
...he sent a backup plan.
What backup plan?
Me.
Simply put, InGen is seeking limited partners to defray some of our expenses.
The prospectus you've been given by the board details...
...our projected hardware and construction expenses.
As you can see by my two friends here, the software is already fully developed.
One might say, "It'd be up and running. "
In a moment,
I'll take you on a stroll through the camp...
...and you'll see some larger, more impressive specimens.
You don't bring people halfway around the world to visit a zoo.
You bring the zoo to them.
San Diego is the perfect setting.
People already associate our beautiful city with animal attractions:
San Diego Zoo, Sea World,
San Diego Chargers.
Mr. Hammond knew this.
Before he ever dreamt of an island...
...he began construction on an amphitheatre...
...very near to where you're sitting now, the InGen waterfront complex.
But he abandoned it...
...in favour of something far grander...
...and ultimately impossible.
And so, the facility sits unused, unfinished...
...when it could be completed and ready to receive visitors in less than a month.
Ajay, look out! Jump!
That's the last time I leave you in charge.
Oh, my God. Are you out of your mind?
She's got a broken leg.
Let's get in the car before they hear us.
- You have any idea what that is?
- Come on, open the door.
You're nuts.
Man, Ian's not going to like this.
What's going on?
Isn't it obvious?
We're not alone on this island.
It's not set to the frequency.
Look here.
What the hell is that?
Hello?
No, not Enrique. Ian Malcolm.
Are you on the boat?
No, is this the boat?
We're on Isla Sorna.
We need to talk to the boat, Mar del Plata.
I'll get him.
All right. That's it. I got you.
- I got you.
- Hurry up.
Let's go. Go. Come on.
Watch his tail. Get the door.
Boy, is she mad at you.
- I feel sorry for that guy, Enrique.
- No lectures, please.
Honey, stay back. Don't stand up, okay?
- I got it!
- Watch his head.
- Watch his head.
- Ian, he's hurt!
No, honey, no.
He'll snip at you. Watch his tail.
- All right?
- Okay, I got him.
- Got him?
- Yeah.
There you go.
What must I do, hit her with a stick?
No, don't get close, honey.
- Watch out! Don't stand too close.
- He has that not-so-fresh smell.
No, lady, enough! Wrong frequency.
Nick, don't let him get those things around you.
Okay, let's take a look at this.
Easy, easy. Just calm down now.
Okay, here are the metatarsals.
Tibia, fibula. There it is.
There's the fracture.
- Right above the epiphysis.
- How bad is it?
If we don't set it, he'll die. It won't heal.
He won't be able to pivot on his ankle.
He won't be able to run or walk.
A predator will pick him off.
Carlos, come in.
Goddamn it, you bastard, listen...
Other animals are going to hear this.
Come in, please. Can you hear me?
I've got to get out of here. I want to leave.
- I'm calling the boat.
- I want to go someplace else.
I don't want to be here.
I want to be somewhere safe.
- Isn't it safe here?
- I want to be somewhere high.
What? What is it? What's going on?
Information, please. What?
You're much happier not knowing.
Get us up. Here we go.
There we go.
I'm so stupid.
I shouldn't have come along with you.
Can you set it?
Yeah, I just need something temporary to break apart and fall off as he grows.
Whenever you're ready.
He's fighting, Dr. Quinn.
What's the frequency for the boat?
15888. Third from the top.
Okay, we're high.
This is the safest place you can be.
Like Sarah said, the plants make it so the animals won't know you're here.
You're just saying that.
I remember the stories you told.
No, this is nothing like that. We're in a completely different situation now.
Is there a way to communicate with the trailer?
He's moving again, more morphine.
We have no idea what his metabolism is.
We'll kill him with too much.
I need your hand here.
Put some pressure there.
No answer. What a surprise.
How do I get down?
Tie this belt around you.
Where are you going?
Stay here. Come on, stay here.
Squeeze this rope hard.
The harder you squeeze, the slower you go.
- If you don't squeeze at all-
- I get the idea.
Dad, please stay here.
- Stay here, please.
- Honey, the queen? The goddess?
Your inspiration?
Now you're talking. All right.
I'm coming right back. I give you my word.
But you never keep your word!
Personally, I would have squeezed just a little harder.
Okay, I'm almost finished.
Damn. I need another adhesive.
Something pliable I can...
Spit.
Your gum.
Get the amoxicillin and fill a syringe.
Quick injection of antibiotics and he's out of here.
For once in your life, would it kill you to pick it up?
- Help me get it out of here.
- No, we just set its leg.
Mommy's very angry.
This isn't hunting behaviour, Ian.
They're searching.
They came for their infant.
Let's not disappoint them.
Let me get his head, okay?
Careful. Be careful.
I got him.
Muzzle off.
- Yes, Eddie?
- They're going back to the jungle.
- I know. I see. How's Kelly?
- She's fine. She's right here.
Hello?
- Kelly, are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.
Stay there. Don't move.
I'll be right back up. Understand?
Yeah, I understand.
I beg people to listen to me.
I use plain, simple English.
Shut up.
That should make an interesting chapter in your book.
The debate over the parental instincts of the T. Rex is now academic.
Hang on. This is gonna be bad.
They're pushing us over the cliff.
Oh, my God.
Come on, come on.
- Once we're out of here-
- Into the woods.
- Straight into the woods. Come on!
- This is where they hit us.
- Hang on to something!
- Hang on to something!
Oh, my God. Oh, God, please!
Don't move!
I'm coming down for you.
Here I come. Stay still.
Here I come, Sarah.
The satellite phone, get it!
Give me your hand.
Heads up!
Your lucky pack.
I got her.
- Nick?
- We're in here.
Wait. Hold on! I'm coming!
I'm coming.
What did this?
Kelly. What'd you do with Kelly?
She's okay. She's in the High Hide.
- Who's hurt? What do you need?
- We need rope.
Rope. Anything else?
- Three cheeseburgers with everything.
- No onions on mine.
And an apple turnover.
Hold on.
I'm coming!
Bring the rope. Let's go.
- I'm coming.
- Now, now.
- Eddie, you all right?
- Yeah. I'm coming.
We need the rope. Throw it down here.
Hurry!
Good throw. Did you tie this to anything?
- We're sliding!
- We're sliding down!
Up you go.
Increase your rate of climb.
Our communication equipment's been destroyed.
And if your radio and satellite phone were in those trailers-
- They were.
- Then we're stuck here.
And stuck together, thanks to you people.
We came to watch.
You came to strip-mine the place.
- Back off.
- At least we came prepared.
Five years of work and electrified fence couldn't prepare the other island.
- You think your Marlboro men will help?
- You're looters. You came to take.
You have no rights.
An extinct animal brought back to life has no rights.
It exists because we made it.
We patented it. We own it.
- You looking for a problem?
- And I found you, didn't I?
I know you.
You're that Earth First bastard.
- What's Earth First?
- Professional saboteurs.
- Environmentalists!
- Criminals.
Knock it off! Listen to me.
Moving the baby to our camp may have changed the adults' perceived territory.
Their what?
That's why they attacked the trailers.
- They're defending this entire area now.
- We have to move now.
To where? Our boat and their airlift are waiting for orders we can't send.
There's a communications centre here near the old operations building.
Everything ran on geothermal power.
It was never meant to need replenishing.
If we can get here, we can send a radio call to the airlift.
- You know the frequency?
- Here in this book.
- We'll mind those.
- How far is the village?
A day's walk, maybe more.
- That's not the problem.
- What is?
What is the problem?
Velociraptors.
Their nesting sites are in the island's interior, which is why...
- ... we were keeping to the outer rim.
- Wait. What's a Veloc-
Velociraptor. Carnivore. Pack hunter.
Two meters tall, long snout...
...binocular vision, strong forearms, killing claws on both feet.
The Rexes may track us, too, if they feel we're a threat to their infant.
No, we'll lose them once we leave their territory.
Don't bet on it. Tyrannosaur has the largest proportional olfactory cavity...
...of any creature in fossil record, except one.
The Turkey Vulture could scent up to 10 miles.
Right. This is all very thrilling, but I say we should head for the village.
We could head back down to the lagoon.
And sit out in the open, near a heavily used water source...
- ... hope that your captain comes back?
- He won't. He knows better.
Then we head for the village, find shelter and call for help.
Rex just fed, so he won't stalk us for food.
Just fed? You mean Eddie?
Show some respect.
- He saved our lives by giving his.
- Then his troubles are over.
My point is predators don't hunt when they're not hungry.
- No, only humans do.
- You're breaking our heart.
Saddle up!
Let's get this moveable feast underway.
Excuse me, cowboy.
You want some gum?
You seem like you have common sense.
Why the hell are you here?
Somewhere on this island is the greatest predator that ever lived.
The second greatest predator must take him down.
- You going to use that?
- If he doesn't surrender, yes.
- Let me see it.
- No.
The animal exists for the first time in tens of millions of years...
...and the only way you can express yourself is to kill it.
Remember that chap about 20 years ago?
I forget his name.
Climbed Everest without any oxygen.
Came down nearly dead.
They asked him,
"Why did you go up there to die?"
He said, " I didn't. I went up there to live. "
I didn't wish you luck on your new venture.
You're off to a promising start.
My team is intact.
I'm sorry for the loss of your man.
It's easy to criticise someone who generates an idea, assumes the risk.
When you try to sound like Hammond, it comes off as a hustle.
It's not your fault.
They say talent skips a generation.
I'm sure your kids will be sharp as tacks.
Hammond's reach exceeded his grasp.
Mine does not.
Taking dinosaurs off this island...
...is the worst idea in the long, sad history of bad ideas.
And I'll be there when you learn that.
Take a break. Five minutes.
Are you injured?
No, it's the baby's. I set its broken leg.
It won't dry in the humidity.
Roland, a word?
I'd love to know where we are.
Making friends with Ahab?
Carter, I'm going to the ladies' room.
Wait for me here. Okay?
It's not polite to sneak up on people.
Carter! Where are you?
I got turned around in here.
Shit!
Carter, let me hear from you!
Okay, break's over. Moving on!
Carry me.
Get off!
- When did you last see him?
-10, 15 minutes.
Come with me. And you.
If he's alive, we'll find him.
The rest of you go on.
You'll reach the ridge in 10 minutes.
Wait for us there.
No one tells the little girl.
Right. Let's carry on.
Everybody up.
Come on. Up, up.
All right guys, let's get the hell out of here.
Did you find him?
Just the parts they didn't like. Map.
The operations building is right down in there...
...about a mile and a half from the base of these cliffs.
- How do you know that?
- I've seen it.
The climb down won't be easy.
We'll let them sleep one more hour.
Then we hit it.
What is that?
Stay down! Don't move!
Don't run!
Don't look, just run! Run!
Bastard!
You son of a bitch!
He can't reach you! Stay back!
He can't reach us!
Oh, my God! A snake!
Stay back!
It's okay.
It's coming back!
Dad!
Thank you.
Don't go into the long grass!
Not into the long grass!
Look at this.
- What is it?
- I think it's Ajay's bag.
Go, as fast as you can.
Go!
I see structures there.
They said the communications centre is in the operations building.
I'll get in there and send the radio call.
See you there.
- Wait for us.
- Every second counts.
If you can keep up, you're welcome to try.
- Okay, here we come.
- No! Rest.
Damn it!
CQ, this is InGen Operations
Harvest Leader to Harvest Base.
Repeating, I'm calling for InGen Harvest Leader...
- ... seeking InGen Harvest Base.
- Go ahead, Harvest Leader.
The operation has suffered severe casualties.
The survivors are now in mortal danger.
I need you to send rescue immediately.
Our co-ordinates here are...
...9° 58' north, 85°...
Here, here!
Inside! Anywhere!
Go.
- Where do I go when I'm out?
- I'm right behind you-
Look out!
Up here!
Hey, you!
The school cut you from the team?
Get out of here!
Come on. Let's go!
Let's go!
- What about the other survivors?
- Another chopper's coming.
It's okay. It's over.
That's one souvenir they won't be taking with them.
Find the infant tyrannosaur.
Roland knows where the nest is.
I want it on my jet.
I'll take it directly to the infirmary in San Diego.
Hurry. I want to be airborne before the female knows.
You probably saved InGen.
We lost everything we came after on this trip.
But this animal and its infant will bail us out.
Congratulations.
You've got your trophy!
A buck.
But it's alive! Everyone will line up and appreciate it and what you did for us.
What's the matter?
He didn't make it. Ajay.
I'm sorry.
Really, I am.
I remember the people who help me.
There's a job for you in San Diego, if you want it.
No, thank you.
I've spent enough time in the company of death.
Oh, my God.
Fifteen years ago,
John Hammond had a dream.
Like John himself, the dream was grand.
It was outsized. It was bold.
It was impractical. It was not to be.
Half an hour from now...
...John Hammond's dream, re-imagined, will come true.
For. 01 of the cost of building a destination resort...
Is this the Ludlow affair?
- This is private property.
- We're on the list.
Turn around, get back in your car.
- This is Dr. Harding, I'm Dr. Malcolm.
- We have Mr. Ludlow's test results.
There's good and bad news.
Tonight we will christen
Jurassic Park, San Diego...
...a mega-attraction that will drive turnstile numbers...
...to rival any theme park in the world.
I want to thank each one of you for coming in these wee small hours of the morning.
- The ship is here.
- It's early?
You better come now.
It's so exciting!
- See that couple?
- Sir, you need to look at this.
Let them see this up close.
I need a direct line to the Coast Guard.
Look. That's their transponder signal,
Venture 5888.
- They're coming in, but I can't raise them.
- Try again.
Skipper, SS Venture, this is InGen
Harbour Master. Do you copy? Over.
Skipper, SS Venture, you are approaching the breakwater at flank speed.
Reduce at once. Over.
SS Venture, reduce your speed at once.
SS Venture, this is InGen Harbour Master.
You are entering a docking area.
What's everybody looking at?
We should've stayed in the car.
- You okay, Mr. Ludlow?
- I don't know. How do I look?
- Oh, my God.
- Where's the crew?
All over the place.
I smell a fuel leak!
Check the cargo hold!
- There may be crew down there.
- Everybody off the boat!
No! Get away from that!
Now you're John Hammond.
- Why wasn't it tranquillised?
- It was hit it with two darts of Carfentanil.
- It was over 10 milligrams.
- That'd put it in a coma.
It stopped breathing.
We gave it naltrexone to counteract.
But we didn't know how much.
You gave an antagonist without knowing the dosage?
You put it in a narcoleptic state.
It's a locomotive now.
- We're prepared here.
- Any more dinosaurs on the boat?
No, the infant was flown in.
We had this to tranquillise it.
Do you have the infant?
It's safe.
The animal's dehydrated.
First, it'll go to a water source...
...then look for the next thing its body needs.
All the containment equipment is here.
We must get it back to the boat.
I know what you're gonna say.
When we brought the baby to the trailer, it came.
There's no reason why it won't do the same thing here.
Where's the infant?
In a secured facility. Why?
Where's the facility?
There's a dinosaur in our backyard.
Benjamin, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
What?
Come on. There's a dinosaur in our backyard.
The problem is, you need to read to him.
If you serve him dinner, he won't be up all night.
It's the stupid fish tank!
He needs a proper nightlight.
- It may as well be daytime.
- Just turn it off.
Slow down. Slow it down!
There it is.
He's sedated.
Really heavily. Give me a hand.
When the adult sees us again with his baby, isn't he going to be like:
" You!"
There may be some angry recognition.
Who knows?
He may be just happy to see us.
What the hell are you doing?
We're taking the kid.
If you really want to stop us, shoot us.
- How will we find the adult?
- Follow the screams.
- There.
- Oh, my God.
It's too drugged.
He won't know we have it unless it makes some sound!
Wake up. Come on.
He knows.
Ian, slow down a little.
I don't think so.
This guy's almost fully awake.
You know where you're going?
The waterfront's on the other side of these warehouses.
- Is there a way through?
- There could be.
There we go.
You have to follow me now.
There we go.
- Got him?
- Yep.
- Ready?
- Where's the Rex? Is it still behind us?
There's the water.
Shoot it. Tell them to shoot it.
No, you idiot, the adult. Shoot the adult.
I want the baby back alive.
What have you done with it?
I want that infant!
Are you there?
There you are.
There's a first-rate shot of the deck of the ship...
...and the cargo hold that, for the moment...
...contains the animal itself, presumably with the infant alongside.
By our calculations, they are nearing the halfway point of this trip.
Jim, can you hear me there?
Yes, I can, Bernard.
We are halfway to the island.
It is 206 nautical miles from our present location.
The ship is moving at 20 knots...
...which will put it in at about 11:30 a. m.,
Eastern time.
One of the Navy's primary concerns has been safety.
If we look at the ever-growing escort around the ship...
...they're taking no chances of a repeat of the San Diego incident.
Let's take a moment to run the tape...
...of our interview earlier today with John Hammond.
He's the former head of InGen BioEngineering...
...the man who is now spearheading this movement...
...not only to return the animals to their island...
...but to keep the island itself intact.
It is absolutely imperative...
...that we work with the Costa Rican
Department of Biological Preserves...
...to establish a set of rules...
...for the preservation and isolation of that island.
These creatures require our absence to survive, not our help.
And if we could only step aside...
...and trust in nature...
...life will find a way.
- 950 grams. Nice and juicy.
- That's a shoulder piece, isn't it?
The Kube brothers get what they always get. Tell me about it!
- How much do we owe you?
- Two sacks.
Oh, it's Mr Interligator.
How's the wife?
She's doing poorly.
- Roger, your shawl.
- But I've got my shawl.
So she tried to commit suicide again?
By some miracle, she's alive.
Butcher, I think...
- you're getting a customer.
- Who's next?
I am.
- That for me?
- At your service.
Put it on my bill.
We all know where she keeps her bill.
OK, you're next.
That damn carburettor.
This has happened before.
That'll cost you... Iet's see... the ride plus the luggage...
How are you paying?
- In lentils?
- That's all I have left.
Listen, I'd settle for those shoes.
- We're closed for the day.
- I didn't come about that.
I don't eat meat anyway.
- I came about the ad.
- What ad?
- The ad in the paper.
- What paper?
Hard Times.
Hold on...
"Light maintenance jobs.
Odd jobs. Room and board."
"Room facing south."
I do have the right address, don't I?
Number 129a?
Whether here or there, this is nowhere.
That way we don't get hassled by the neighbours.
Nor by any visitors.
Well...
I must have made a mistake.
Not so fast.
You're looking for a job, right?
Come over here.
- Turn around.
- Pardon me?
Turn around.
How much do you weigh?
63 or 64 kilos. Why?
You're not exactly hefty.
The job I've got takes muscle.
- Don't worry about that.
- I'm a butcher.
I'm straight with people. So I'd say you haven't got what it takes.
You don't have the body structure, the right breadth.
Nonetheless I'll give you a try.
But you'll have to bust your ass.
I'd call that a stroke of luck.
- Thanks.
- Come on, let's go.
So what exactly does the job entail?
Light maintenance jobs. Odd jobs.
Room and board. Room facing south.
- Just like in the ad?
- What do you know? Like in the ad.
Hey, watch it. One of the steps is loose. You'll have to fix that.
And do all the painting, cleaning, the electricity. The whole shebang.
You'll like it here, you'll see.
And there aren't any neighbours opposite. The key is on this nail.
Well, I'll let you get settled in.
Thanks.
- How are things in town?
- Terrible. Really terrible.
It's the rationing. They'd eat their shoes. Kind of touch and go.
- They haven't got any street smarts.
- It's a mess. Till things grow back.
Nothing will ever grow back. Ever.
- You're quite the optimist.
- Get that through your thick skull.
- Well, is your hair growing back?
- No.
You see? It's the same thing.
Couldn't we open that window for five minutes?
I like the smell of glue. It smells like fish. It brings back memories.
What do you think of the new guy?
Are you deaf or something?
He's skinny.
Still thinking of her, huh?
Apparently she's hearing voices now.
Would it be too much of an effort to put that a bit closer?
Hello.
Ma'am...
She's deaf as a post. This way we always know where she is.
Granny, go back upstairs to your room. There's nothing left. Now go.
You finished? Then don't hang around.
Fix the bulb on the 2nd floor.
- Hi, butcher.
- Hi, postman.
- Got a parcel for your daughter.
- Upstairs.
- Watch the step.
- Mind your business.
Grab it, Marcel.
- I've got it.
- Throw it over here. Throw it.
You shit.
Postal Administration. Article 12.
You've got exactly 20 seconds to get back to your flats.
- Move.
- You don't have kids to feed.
That applies to kids as well.
Can't you read, moron?
- "Julie Clapet."
- He's a friend.
A friend?
Here, Julie.
Sign here, Julie.
I call you Julie because I like you.
But I don't want to rush you.
See you, Julie.
- Here. For the ad.
- Always at your service.
- That new guy is kind of weird.
- He used to be a circus man.
I'm sure this contains some tidbits to eat. That's why they're...
- Would you like to taste them?
- Yes. I'd love to.
Shall we say at 7? That'll give me time to get things ready.
- Is he after her?
- After who?
Your daughter. She's a cute slip of a thing. She needs someone.
- That someone is me. Is that clear?
- Hey, I've got news.
They shot one down two days ago.
A superb 30-metre target.
- No bodies?
- They cart them away.
Bloody vermin.
They even say they eat money.
We've got to get rid of them for good, those vegetable-eating queers.
They'll get what's coming to them.
THE ENEMY PLOTS AGAINST US
- Bye, butcher.
- Bye, postman.
- Do you think that's it for tonight?
- I hope so.
That goddamn butcher,
I'm sure he won't do it tonight.
He's taking his time just to make me mad.
- He's obviously succeeded.
- What's he waiting for anyway?
Till the new guy tries to escape in a garbage can, too?
- How long did the other guy last us?
- A week.
Not counting the broth, that is.
One week. We polished off the last chunk two days ago.
I'm hungry. I'm bloody starving.
I'm fucking starving.
My little Hercule... Every man for himself, and God for all.
- Hi there. It's me.
- Hello.
Come in.
Please, do come in.
- For you.
- Thank you.
Sit down.
- Did you paint that?
- Yes, it's nothing much.
- No, no...
- No problem.
I've made a pot of tea.
- Shall I pour you a cup?
- Yes, please.
- I hope you don't find me too bold.
- Oh, no. Not at all.
- Why should I?
- A girl invites you to her flat.
Some would consider that a bit brazen.
- Well, actually...
- And thank you for this morning.
- Why thank you?
- You rescued my parcel on the steps.
I was very moved by your concern.
That goes without saying.
No, on the contrary. People usually only think of themselves nowadays.
Only because they have nothing.
Deep down, they're still good people.
I'm glad to hear they like me.
They're very kind.
I'm getting along with your father, too. He thinks I'm a nice guy, right?
- Why not try Kraft cheese spread?
- That's new.
- And handy.
- They talk to me about you.
- Who?
- The voices in my head.
Oh, right. The voices.
And what do they say?
Hold on, let me try to remember...
- It's more the language they use.
- Do they talk about love?
Oh, no.
"Robert's a pervert, an arse wipe, a panty eater." You see?
But that's not true.
Aurore, you're missing something really funny.
At any rate, I have no choice.
Here. Tomorrow at 11 sharp.
- Ring me. I'm counting on you.
- But...
"Arse wipe"?
Move out? What for?
I've just moved in.
Because it's pretty awful here.
The building is unsanitary.
The walls are falling apart, and it leaks.
- Perhaps you don't like me?
- Me?
- You act as if you want me to leave.
- No, on the contrary. Not at all...
It does that once in a while.
Did I hurt you?
- I'll be all right.
- Then it must be the shock.
I'm such a klutz.
Don't move.
I'm blind as a bat.
Everything's all foggy.
I could get lost in that fog.
Leave it. I buy two of everything because I break things.
- So you play the cello?
- Yes.
I play an instrument as well.
Will you wait for me?
- Oh, shit. Not again.
- What are you doing?
- I wanted to draw a bath.
- Again?
Well, you sharpen your knives often enough, too.
A musical saw...
- It has a nice sound.
- Sit down.
- The doctor and I had an act once.
- Doctor?
Livingstone. "Dr Livingstone".
He was my partner.
- But now he's gone.
- Where did he go?
He disappeared after a show.
We only found his remains.
They'd eaten him.
Can you imagine that? They ate him.
I lost everything that night.
So, the first ad I ran across...
- And here I am.
- I need to tell you something.
Listen.
Do you know that tune?
It was his favourite.
Have you noticed how clear the nights have been?
That's normal. We're entering the Virgo age. That's my sign.
- No kidding?
- I swear it. My ascendant is Leo.
Cut it out. Not everyone's Gorilla, ascendant Bulldozer.
I'm in luck, there's more in store.
"Get ready, the wind's shifting."
You'd like to pack up and leave, right?
You wouldn't get far. It's worse out there, they draw straws.
And it'd be a shame to lose these juicy hams. These little sucklings...
Stop joking around. I don't like it.
You're better off here.
At least we have a system.
My ass! Your helpers are drawing straws, too. What about that ad?
That's fate.
You can't change fate.
It's like you said: the wind is shifting.
Everyone's going to get it.
Mr Louison,
I shouldn't tell you this, but ..
What happened to your friend... the same thing goes on here.
It takes place at night in the stairwell.
That's why no one ever goes out.
And my father...
SOPORIFIC HERBAL TEA
Hi. I'm here to fix the box springs.
Come in.
This is an antique.
It's seen a lot of use.
- Yes.
- What seems to be the problem?
It squeaks. I find it bothersome.
Could you bounce around on it a bit?
Just so I can hear?
- I can't see what's wrong.
- It squeaks most when there are two.
Let's give it a try.
Just as I thought, it's the 2nd spring to the right.
Come, Aurore...
We are here, Aurore... to help you.
Come...
Freed from life... come with us, Aurore.
Tranquil and at peace...
Aurore, come...
COME AT 11 SHARP.
RING HARD.
Rotten world ...
That should do it.
- Here.
- Thanks.
- What are "Troglodists"?
- Outlaws.
- But no one ever sees them.
- Just tales to distract the people.
- A typical Capricorn attitude.
- Wrong. I'm Aquarius.
- Oh?
- A sign of the future.
Oh, the future...
It soon becomes history around here.
- It's very easy to miss a step.
- Don't worry about me.
You brats, give that back this instant.
Rémi, stop sniggering or I'll give you a whacking.
I'll beat the one with the other, do you hear? Give that back.
Oh, great! How will we get that back now, you guttersnipes?
This is a job for the Australian.
The Australian?
The Australian.
Stand back.
That's quite a tool.
The Australian is nothing without its master.
Wow, did you see that?
- Tapioca, did you find a job yet?
- No. Nothing yet.
Bad news. You're running up quite a bill. Not to mention the rent.
I'm in a fix at the moment. But I've got something here. Want a look?
Black market? In these times?
You make me sick.
Just take a look.
A rat-call. The female cry.
It attract males.
So? There aren't any rats left.
What's that?
- This? A bullshit detector.
- Oh, yeah?
- Come on, give it a try.
- Give what a try?
Start bullshitting. Come on.
- Come on...
- I can't do it on command.
Life is wonderful.
Your bullshit detector is shit.
Turn that thing off. It's too loud.
If you don't settle your bill soon, you'll find yourself on my hook.
Very funny. What about that clown?
Isn't that taking a tad too long?
- Everyone in the building is edgy.
- Not before he's redone the ceiling.
And in the meantime, to hell with us, right? I've got mouths to feed.
- Yeah, the granny's, for instance.
- For instance... Why bring her up?
- I've got my reasons.
- What do you mean by that?
Want to pay up?
Give me the granny tonight.
She's one of us.
It's against the rules.
The rules, the rules...
The age limit is a rule, too.
- She's only good for pâté.
- She's my mother-in-law.
- Why not take Mrs Interligator?
- Stop yelling.
- It'd be an act of charity.
- Please.
Interligator is fond of his wife.
He's a good tenant. He pays.
The bloody rich.
They always manage.
You haven't got much choice in view of your debts.
Oh, it's you, Julie.
- You gave me a fright.
- Counting your money again?
Well, yes. Tell me...
You don't come to see me very often.
It's nice of you to come.
- Well, did you like your gift?
- It must have cost you a bundle.
Well, yes.
Anything to make you happy.
- You've loved sweets since you...
- But I don't any more.
- Let him go.
- You always ask the same thing.
- It's the same old story every time.
- No, this time...
This time it's different? True. Just look at you. I know what he's up to.
With his puppy eyes. Making your head spin with his dreams...
- There's no room for dreams.
- Stop that.
It's a tough world out there.
I didn't make the world.
I know you hate my trade, but it's an art like any other.
- Let him leave this place.
- With you? You won't last two weeks.
- I don't want to lose you.
- You lost me long ago.
Julie...
TROGLODISM: AN UNDERGROUND
ORGANISATION?
Good evening, old girl. Guess what?
Let's play a little game, OK?
I'll scare you, and you'll scream.
That little clown upstairs will rush to your rescue.
Let's begin, OK?
Go for it!
Planning to take my picture or what?
Scream, goddamn it.
You came from the N.E. sector to annoy us with your beau's troubles?
- Mr Louison.
- I don't know him. No names. No I.D.
- We're at war, girlie.
- We're outlaws. He's Rolls.
- Voltange.
- Rolan. Tourneur. Milan.
- Trap.
- Pank. Fox. Paumeau.
- We watch out for moles.
- You could be one.
- I'm not a liar. It's the truth.
- You, a surfacer? Talk about truth?
Do you know what this is?
Take a close look.
- Your brother Matt's shirt.
- Shot down like a rabbit.
- Now that's the truth.
- Common game. That's all we are.
- And you're predators.
- Not me. I swear.
- You're one of them. A carnivore.
- What?
Is that the way you rats treat ladies?
- Hey, watch it!
- For God's sake!
Oh, my God.
Tell Calamity Jane to smarten up, or all hell will break loose.
- Got it.
- A month's harvest is on the floor.
- Plus the risks.
- Matt died for that.
Right. Tell her.
Corn...
There's plenty more in my building.
30 large bags in my dad's cellar.
- What's this guy of yours look like?
- Louison, Rolls...
Yeah, the guy you want us to pick up.
- Can I help you, miss?
- No, just an old coffee grinder.
Coffee? Some people have it made.
So you went for a walk last night?
A long one at that.
First ruckus, then screams.
This building is a madhouse.
Your father may work at night, but this is going too far.
There you are, Julie.
You OK?
Sorry, I was just rehearsing a new number.
Hold on...
Here.
Didn't you hear anything last night?
No, your tea made sure ofthat.
A pot of tea a night, just as you prescribed.
I'll get you some more, you're almost all out.
You should drink some, too.
You look exhausted.
- Cheer up, she died a natural death.
- Come on, let's go.
But still, I'd have liked to say goodbye.
Why don't we do that right now?
Poor Robert.
What made you rush out into the stairwell at night anyway?
I did it for Aurore.
I wanted to save her.
I'm telling you, she wasn't the one who screamed.
Anyway, here you go.
Still, I did it for her.
The butcher was very decent.
He apologised.
Invite you to dinner?
I haven't got much.
That's fine. That way we won't feel weighed down.
- At 9 p.m.?
- Sharp. I'm always on time.
- Rather unusual for a girl, right?
- For a girl, you're rather unusual.
I owe you a lot, you know?
- Did you forgive them...
- For Livingstone?
- One must always forgive.
- Depends. It's not always possible.
Don't say that.
No one is completely evil.
It depends on circumstance. Or they don't realise they've done wrong.
36th sector, 5th division.
Squirmer's Avenue.
What did that girl say? The girl!
Sector 3/4, 69° north-east.
Albumin Square. Here.
All right, let's go.
Scout to Sauce Master. Heading towards target, 69° north-east.
Sauce Master to Scout.
Read you, over and out.
Watch your backsides, guys!
Come, Aurore...
They are the worm... you are the fruit.
Not again! Darn it!
It seems rather quiet.
Not Father's golf clubs.
Yes, Father's clubs...
- Know who's on TV tonight?
- I don't have a TV.
Look, isn't that your customer?
- Shit.
- I'm a bit pressed for time.
No offence, but would you permit me to come back later tonight... to pay my respects to your daughter?
- Danger, we know not.
- Audacious, that's us.
Courageous, give me three.
Generous, you, you, you and me.
Scout to Sauce Master.
Corn located at site.
I repeat: corn located at site.
Proceeding with reconnaissance mission. Target: Louison.
I repeat: target, Louison.
An ambush.
- Aurore, what's the matter now?
- Georges...
Throw in your apron?
Now I've heard it all.
I've been thinking about it for a while now. I'm getting older.
I'm losing my touch.
And so many victims...
- I feel sorry for them.
- Sorry? That's not like you.
No one's entirely evil.
It's circumstance.
Or they don't realise they've done wrong.
Some say you have to be able to forgive. Do you forgive me?
An old bastard like you?
- Maybe I could.
- You're sweet.
The guys you finished off wouldn't forgive you, though.
- You'd really have to insist on it.
- If only Julie could forgive me.
- Have you asked her?
- She wouldn't ever.
- But you're her father.
- She won't even speak to me.
Want me to go see her?
I could explain it all to her.
All she cares about is that Louison.
But then, he's not such a bad guy.
By the way, he's on TV tonight.
Why don't you go tell him?
I bet he doesn't know.
He has his head in the clouds.
- You should really eat something.
- Not hungry.
Not hungry.
Fox...
You've been hiding things.
You're on TV tonight.
What do you know about that!
Livingstone.
The Criekville Casino.
Our Tica Tica Walk was a big hit back then.
Tica Tica what?
Oh, shit.
- So that's your new number?
- I can explain, Julie.
Sorry, I didn't mean to disturb you.
I messed things up again.
- He's got clown shoes.
- Mission accomplished.
We'll wait for the others.
Julie?
Recipe 8: Cordon Bleu to Sniper.
Artichoke Heart Soufflé.
- Quiet down.
- Artichoke Heart Soufflé.
Preparation: H minus 35 minutes.
Then the onions. Simmer the snipers.
Cover them for about 15 minutes.
I repeat: for about 15 minutes.
H minus 20 minutes: stir the sauce.
I repeat: H minus 20 minutes.
THE STARS OF THE CIRCUS
Julie, I didn't think you'd come.
- Good evening...
- I'll have a cup of tea.
- Pardon?
- I'll have a cup of tea.
A cup of tea?
You have...
I'll have one as well.
Yes, a nice cup of tea.
Aurore, come and watch.
It's spellbinding.
Come, Aurore...
Come...
- You're wearing...
- I found some contact lenses.
...they'll titillate us.
Here's Stan and Livingstone.
- You never told me about this.
- Julie... that's Livingstone.
Livingstone, Julie.
- I don't believe this.
- It's the antenna, Dad.
- What a drag.
- It's the antenna.
- Go and fix the wire.
- In this storm? No way.
That bastard.
It's the antenna.
Because of the wind.
Louison.
Aurore... come...
It's so much better here, near us...
Come...
Louison...
- What?
- Come back.
I can't hear you.
Come back.
Go back inside, Julie.
Watch out.
Mr Louison?
No...
To the right.
A bit more.
Yes. OK. Perfect. Perfect!
Leave it the way is. Perfect.
Georges...
Aurore?
- No more Robert...
- I fell.
That pervert who just wants to drag you down into the mire... down into the sewer, into the sew...
- So it was you all along.
- No.
Since when have you been doing this?
- No, I can explain.
- You bastard.
It comes from downstairs.
You'll hurt your leg, Robert.
Stop.
Help, help!
You shit. Son of a bitch.
- I fell.
- Yes, Aurore.
I wanted to get up on the chair.
I fell.
Yes, Aurore.
The Troglos. The Troglos are kidnapping someone.
Les Troglos...
How nice of you to make coffee,
Julie. Expecting company?
Take your clothes off.
- Julie, hurry.
- That Interligator woman... blew herself up sky high.
Took her husband with her.
Where are you going?
Stop them, Robert.
Julie, what are you doing here?
Wipe that muck off your face.
Do you hear me? Go home this instant.
And wipe off that lipstick.
And you, I'll skin you alive.
Just you wait. I'll get you yet.
I'll get you.
Just you wait.
- Who goes there?
- Snipers.
How did it go? Everything all right?
Everybody OK?
Hey, Tourneur, look what I found.
- Yes, but how about the others?
- Here they are.
- How did it go?
- Easy. Virtually fell into our arms.
And we're all here.
Shit.
- Where did she come from?
- What the hell...
- Shit.
- Pank...
Is that the guy we were supposed to grab? The target you located?
- Pank, can you explain this to us?
- Wasn't that the plan?
"Albumin Square. Name: Louison."
That's what it says.
But it also says: "Sex: male.
Shoes: that of a clown's."
- Then we'd better check it out.
- Sex: male. Male!
- So? What of it?
- OK, so tell me, is the sex male?
Not my problem.
Our mission was Louison. You got it.
Louison...is the package here male?
Yes or no?
I guess we should check it out.
Sorry, Louison, just part of the job.
I must have landed in a loony bin.
I'm sick and tired of this bullshit.
There's been a mistake, so let me go.
See, guys?
Female through and through.
Cordon Bleu calling Onion Snipers.
Artichoke Heart here.
I repeat: Artichoke Heart.
In immediate danger.
Cordon Bleu calling Onion Snipers.
- Artichoke Heart is in danger.
- We'll knock them off like flies.
- Must be cooking up there.
- You can count on those weirdos.
- They'll fix your buddy for good.
- Should we go?
Of course you're going. All of you.
- Doesn't she ever shut up?
- They play rough.
But an agreement is an agreement.
Who's not in? Rap, you're coming with me. Milan, Fox, Tourneur...
- You take the others. Move it.
- But what about me?
What about me?
Don't forget about me. What about me?
You assholes.
In case I don't come back.
Open up.
Give it up, you dimwit.
We'll let you go. I swear.
We won't touch you.
We'll forget the whole thing, OK?
- My cleavers. All of them.
- Right, the cleavers. Kill them off.
- Think you're on a safari, bitch?
- That's my wife.
- No men or women, only volunteers.
- You got it. Obedient volunteers.
Harm one hair of my daughter's head, and I'll carve you up into pieces.
- So, go get my cleavers. Move it.
- On the double.
Where are you?
Where are you?
I don't like this one bit.
It won't be long now.
Julie, get out of here.
Yes. It's me they're after.
Don't cry. I'll be all right.
- Don't cry.
- It's my contacts.
What?
Julie, there's only one thing left to do.
Go on, push. Push.
- What are you doing? Move your butt.
- Can't. I've gained too much weight.
Wait, turn back. Tourneur, wait.
- Shit, Tourneur's been hit.
- Tourneur's been hit.
- Hey, postman. Everything OK?
- I got one. Come and see.
- These monsters are everywhere.
- They've lost one.
They won't be back.
Good ol' Tourneur. Hang in there.
That lead really weighs you down.
- No other damage?
- Don't worry. We'll get you out.
You all right?
Come on, push.
Let me through.
- I don't believe this.
- Water's running.
What the hell are they doing?
Stand back.
What the hell are they up to?
Marcel...
You OK, Marcel?
Come on, get up. Get up.
Go on! Go! Go!
Julie, follow me.
Be careful!
Not a minute too soon.
Miss Plusse, you're a dragonfly in mating season. So a toad like me...
Get lost, jerk. I'm in a rush.
Let the lady by, will you?
I go from one footbath to another. Shit.
I despise you. I hate you.
This time you're done for, clown.
- Cut the bullshit.
- Right. Cut the bullshit.
Now you're going to start singing.
My cleaver, damn it. Hand it over.
- Here, butcher.
- You, here?
This is a job for the Australian.
At any rate, you came at the right time.
No...
- Oh, my God...
- Goddamn Troglos.
Bastards. My Julie...
It's all your fault.
You'll pay for this.
I've got something stuck in my head, right?
Answer me, sausage head.
You, tell me. I'm not dreaming, am I?
I've got something stuck...
Translation: G. Guenther-Kaufmann www.sdi-media.com
Everybody, heads up. Keep it clear, now.
Keep it clear.
Stand back.
Slow it down.
- Pushing team, move in there.
- Move in.
- On your ready.
- I want tasers on full charge.
Steady! Go on. Step back in.
Ready. Move it.
And push!
Well, locked. Loading team, step away.
Jophery, raise the gate.
Block the opening! Don't let her get out!
Somebody help him!
Work her back!
Shoot her!
Shoot her!
- I heard that Hammond's not even here.
- He sends his apologies.
There's a $20 million lawsuit for that worker's death...
...and you're telling me that Hammond can't see me?
He had to leave early, his daughter's getting a divorce.
I understand, but we need to deal with the situation now.
- The insurance company...
- You okay?
The underwriters feel that the accident's raised safety questions about the park.
That makes the investors very anxious.
I had to promise to conduct a thorough, on-site inspection.
Hammond hates inspections.
They slow everything down.
They'll pull the funding.
That'll slow him down even more.
Watch your head.
If two experts sign off on the island, the insurance guys'll back off.
I've already got lan Malcolm, but they think he's too trendy.
- They want Alan Grant.
- Grant?
You'll never get him out of Montana.
Why not?
Why not?
Because Grant's like me.
He's a digger.
Dr. Grant, Dr. Sattler, we're ready to try again.
I hate computers.
The feeling's mutual.
Take a look.
Did it work?
- How long does this take?
- Should bring an immediate return.
You shoot the radar into the ground, and the bone bounces the image back.
Bounces it back...
This new program is incredible.
A few more years' development, and we won't even have to dig anymore.
Where's the fun in that?
It's a little distorted, but I don't think it's the computer.
Post-mortem contraction of the posterior neck ligaments.
Velociraptor?
Yes. Good shape, too.
It's 5, 6 feet high. I'm guessing 9 feet long.
- Look...
- What'd you do?
He touched it.
- Dr. Grant's not machine compatible.
- Hell, they've got it in for me.
And look at the half-moon shaped bones in the wrist.
It's no wonder these guys learned how to fly.
No, seriously.
Maybe dinosaurs have more in common with present-day birds than with reptiles.
Look at the pubic bone, turned backward, like a bird's.
Look at the vertebrae, full of air sacs and hollows, like a bird's.
And even the word "raptor" means "bird of prey."
That doesn't look very scary.
More like a 6-foot turkey.
A turkey?
- Imagine yourself in the Cretaceous period.
- Here we go.
You'd get your first look at this
6-foot turkey as you enter a clearing.
He moves like a bird, lightly bobbing his head.
You keep still because maybe his visual acuity is based on movement...
...like T. Rex and he'll lose you if you don't move.
But no, not Velociraptor.
You stare at him and he just stares right back.
And that's when the attack comes.
Not from the front, but from the side.
From the other two Raptors you didn't even know were there.
Because Velociraptor's a pack hunter.
He uses co-ordinated attack patterns...
...and he is out in force today.
And he slashes at you with this...
...a 6-inch retractable claw, like a razor, on the middle toe.
He doesn't bother to bite your jugular like a lion. No.
He slashes at you...
...here or here...
Alan.
Or maybe across the belly, spilling your intestines.
The point is, you are alive when they start to eat you.
So, you know, try to show a little respect.
Okay.
Alan, if you wanted to scare the kid, you could've pulled a gun on him.
Yeah, I know. Kids.
You want to have one of those?
I don't want that kid, but a breed of child could be intriguing.
I mean, what's so wrong with kids?
They're noisy, they're messy, they're expensive.
Cheap, cheap.
They smell.
- They don't smell!
- Some smell.
- Give me a break!
- Babies smell.
- Cover the site!
- Cover up the dig!
- Tell them to shut down!
- Cut the machine!
Cover it all up. Pull it over.
Just cut it, will you? Shut it down!
What?
What the hell do you think you're doing in here?
We were saving that.
For today, I guarantee it.
- Who in God's name do you think you are?
- John Hammond.
And I'm delighted to meet you finally in person, Dr. Grant.
So, I can see that my $50,000 a year has been well spent.
Who's the jerk?
- This is our paleobotanist. Dr...
- Sattler.
Ellie, this is Mr. Hammond.
I'm sorry about the dramatic entrance,
Dr. Sattler, but...
- Did I say "jerk"?
...we're in a hurry.
Will you have a drink?
We won't let it get warm. Sit down.
- Let me have this.
- I'll just get a glass or two. I can do it.
- There's samples all over here.
- I know my way around the kitchen.
Now, I'll get right to the point.
I like you. Both of you.
I can tell instantly about people. It's a gift.
I own an island off the coast of Costa Rica.
I've leased it from the government and during the last five years...
...l've been setting up a biological preserve.
Really spectacular. Spared no expense.
Make the one I've got down in Kenya look like a petting zoo.
And there's no doubt our attractions will drive kids out of their minds.
- And what are those?
- Small versions of adults, honey.
And not just kids, everyone.
We're opening next year, if the lawyers don't kill me first. Do you like lawyers?
- I don't really know any.
- Don't really know any.
I do, and there's a particular one right now, who represents my investors.
Says that they insist on outside opinions.
What kind of opinions?
Well, your kind, not to put too fine a point on it.
Let's face it, in your particular fields, you're the top minds.
And if I could just persuade you...
...to sign off on the park, give it your endorsement...
...maybe even pen a wee testimonial,
I could get back on schedule.
- Why would they care what we think?
- What kind of park is this?
It's right up your alley.
Why don't you come down, just the pair of you, for the weekend?
I'd love to have an opinion of a paleobotanist as well.
I've got a jet standing by at Choteau.
I'm sorry. This isn't possible.
We just dug up a new skeleton...
I'd compensate you by fully funding your dig...
- This is a very unusual time.
- The timing is...
...for a further three years.
Where's the plane?
- Okay.
- Three years.
Cheers.
Dodgson!
You shouldn't use my name.
Dodgson. We've got Dodgson here.
See, nobody cares. Nice hat.
What're you trying to look like, a secret agent?
- Well?
On delivery, $50,000 more for each viable embryo.
That's $1.5 million if you get all 15 species off the island.
I'll get them all.
Remember, viable embryos.
They're no use to us if they don't survive.
How am I supposed to transport them?
The bottom screws open.
That's great. Oh, my God.
It's cooled and compartmentalised inside.
- You guys. That's great.
- Customs can even check it if they want to.
- Let me see.
- Go on.
- There's enough coolant for 36 hours.
- No menthol?
The embryos have to be back here in San José by then.
That's up to your guy on the boat.
7:00 tomorrow night on the east dock.
Make sure he gets it right.
- How are you planning to beat security?
- I've got an 18-minute window.
18 minutes and your company catches up on 10 years of research.
Don't get cheap on me, Dodgson.
That was Hammond's mistake.
So you two dig up dinosaurs?
- Well...
- We try to.
You'll have to get used to Dr. Malcolm.
He suffers from a deplorable excess of personality, for a mathematician.
Chaotician. Chaotician, actually.
John doesn't subscribe to chaos...
...particularly what it says about his science project.
Lan, you've never been able to sufficiently explain your concerns...
Because of the behaviour of the system in phase space?
A load, if I may say so, of fashionable number crunching...
Don't.
Dr. Sattler, Dr. Grant, you've heard of Chaos Theory?
No.
No? Non-linear equations?
Strange attractors?
I refuse to believe that you aren't familiar with the concept of attraction.
I bring scientists. You bring a rock star.
There it is.
Bad wind shears. We have to drop pretty fast. Hold on, this will be thrilling.
But you need that piece over here, and that piece...
We'll have landed by the time you get it right.
Great.
The full 50 miles of perimeter fence are in place?
And the concrete moats, and the motion-sensor tracking systems.
Donald, dear boy, relax.
Try and enjoy yourself.
Let's get this straight.
This is not a weekend excursion.
This is a serious investigation of the stability of the island.
Your investors, whom I represent, are deeply concerned.
48 hours from now, if they're not convinced, I'm not convinced.
I'll shut you down, John.
In 48 hours,
I'll be accepting your apologies.
All right, slow down. Slow. Stop.
This shouldn't be here.
Alan, this species of veriforman has been extinct, since...
...the Cretaceous Period.
I mean, this thing...
What?
Look at that.
It's a dinosaur.
You did it. Crazy son of a bitch, you did it.
We could tear up the rule book on cold-bloodedness. It doesn't apply.
They're wrong.
This is a warm-blooded creature.
- This thing doesn't live in a swamp.
- This thing's got a 25, 27-foot neck?
- The Brachiosaurus? 30.
- 30 feet.
We're gonna make a fortune with this place.
How fast are they?
Well, we clocked the T. Rex at 32 miles an hour.
T. Rex?
You said you've got a T. Rex?
Say again.
We have a T. Rex.
Put your head between your knees.
Dr. Grant...
...my dear Dr. Sattler...
...welcome to Jurassic Park.
They're moving in herds.
They do move in herds.
How did you do this?
I'll show you.
G'day.
The most advanced amusement park in the entire world...
...incorporating all the latest technologies.
And I'm not talking just about rides.
Everybody has rides.
No, we've made living biological attractions so astounding...
...that they'll capture the imagination of the entire planet.
So, what are you thinking?
- That we're out of a job.
- Don't you mean "extinct"?
Why don't you all sit down?
Donald, sit down.
Here he comes. Well, here I come.
Hello.
Say hello.
Hello.
Hello, John.
Yes, I've got lines.
Well, fine, I guess.
But, how did I get here?
Well, let me show you.
First, I'll need a drop of blood.
Your blood.
Right.
That hurt.
Relax, John.
It's all part of the miracle of cloning.
Hello, John.
Cloned from what? Loy extraction hasn't recreated an intact DNA strand.
Not without massive sequence gaps.
Paleo DNA, from what source?
Where do you get 100 million-year-old dinosaur blood?
What? What?
Well, Mr. DNA, where did you come from?
From your blood.
Just one drop of your blood
contains billions of strands of DNA...
...the building blocks of life.
A DNA strand like me
is a blueprint for building a living thing.
And sometimes animals that went extinct
millions of years ago, like dinosaurs...
...left their blueprints behind for us to find.
We just had to know where to look.
100 million years ago,
there were mosquitoes just like today.
And just like today,
they fed on the blood of animals.
Even dinosaurs.
Sometimes, after biting a dinosaur...
...mosquitoes would land on the branch
of a tree and get stuck in the sap.
After a long time, the tree sap
would get hard and become fossilised...
...just like a dinosaur bone,
preserving the mosquito inside.
This fossilised tree sap,
which we call amber...
...waited for millions of years
with the mosquito inside...
...until Jurassic Park scientists came along.
Using sophisticated techniques,
they extract the preserved blood...
...from the mosquito,
and bingo: Dino DNA I
A full DNA strand contains
three billion genetic codes.
If we looked at screens like these
once a second for eight hours a day...
...it'd take two years
to look at the entire DNA strand.
It's that long.
Since it's so old, it's full of holes.
Now that's where our geneticists
take over.
Thinking machine super-computers
and gene sequencers...
...break down the strand in minutes.
And virtual-reality displays...
...show our geneticists the gaps
in the DNA sequence.
We used the complete DNA of a frog...
...to fill in the holes and complete the code.
Whewl And now,
we can make a baby dinosaur.
This score is only temporary.
It all has very dramatic music, of course.
A march or something.
It hasn't been written yet.
And then, the tour moves on.
Well, look here.
Those hard-working cowpokes...
This is overwhelming, John.
Are these characters autoerotica?
No, we have no animatronics here.
Those people are the real miracle workers of Jurassic Park.
...in unfertilised emu or ostrich eggs.
Wait a minute.
How do you interrupt the cellular mitosis?
- Can't we see the unfertilised eggs?
- Shortly.
Now a whole team of genetic engineers
goes to work on...
- Can't you stop these things?
- I'm sorry. It's kind of a ride.
One, two, three.
You can't do that.
- What?
- Can they do that?
A reminder: The boat for the mainland
will be leaving at 19:00.
All personnel be at the dock
no later than 18:45. No exceptions.
- G'day, Henry.
- Good day, sir.
It's turning the eggs.
Perfect timing. I'd hoped they'd hatch before I had to go to the boat.
Henry, why didn't you tell me?
I insist on being here when they're born.
Come on.
Come on, little one.
Very good. Push.
- Very good.
- God.
Push. Come on.
Come on. Come on, then.
There you are. There.
They imprint on the first creature they come in contact with.
Helps them to trust me.
I've been present for the birth of every creature on this island.
Surely not the ones that have bred in the wild.
Actually they can't breed in the wild.
Population control is one of our security precautions.
There's no unauthorised breeding in Jurassic Park.
How do you know they can't breed?
Because all the animals in Jurassic Park are female.
We've engineered them that way.
There you are.
Oh, my God. Look at that.
Blood temperature seems like about high 80s, maybe.
What?
Homeothermic? It holds that temperature?
Yes.
But, again, how do you know they're all female?
What, does somebody go out in the park and pull up the dinosaurs' skirts?
We control their chromosomes.
It's really not that difficult.
All vertebrate embryos are inherently female.
They just require an extra hormone given at the right developmental stage...
...to make them male.
- We simply deny them that.
- Deny them that?
John, the kind of control you're attempting is not possible.
If there's one thing the history of evolution has taught us...
...it's that life will not be contained.
Life breaks free. Expands to new places...
...and it crashes through barriers, painfully, maybe even dangerously...
...but there it is.
There it is.
You're implying that a group composed entirely of female animals will breed.
No, I'm simply saying that life finds a way.
What species is this?
It's a Velociraptor.
You bred Raptors?
Dr. Grant! As I was saying, we laid on lunch for you before you go into the park.
- Our gourmet chef, Alejandro...
- What are they doing?
Feeding them.
Alejandro's prepared a delightful menu for us. Chilean sea bass.
Shall we?
They should all be destroyed.
Robert Muldoon.
My game warden from Kenya.
Bit of an alarmist, but knows more about Raptors than anyone.
What's their growth rate?
They're lethal at eight months, and I do mean lethal.
I've hunted most things that can hunt you, but how these things move...
- Fast for a biped?
- Cheetah speed.
50, 60 miles per hour if they ever got out in the open.
And they're astonishing jumpers.
Yes. That's why we're taking extreme precautions.
Do they show intelligence?
They show extreme intelligence.
Even problem-solving intelligence.
Especially the big one.
We bred eight originally, but when she came in...
...she took over the pride and killed all but two of the others.
That one, when she looks at you, you can see she's working things out.
That's why we have to feed them like this.
She had them all attacking the fences when the feeders came.
The fences are electrified, right?
That's right, but they never attack the same place twice.
They were testing the fences for weaknesses systematically.
They remember.
Yes. Well, who's hungry?
More adventurous guests, of course,
can opt for our jungle river cruise...
...or for a close-up look at our majestic...
None of these attractions are ready yet, but the park will open...
...with the basic tour you are about to take, and then other rides will come on-line...
...six or twelve months after that.
Absolutely spectacular designs.
- Spared no expense.
- And we can charge anything we want.
$2,000 a day, $10,000 a day, and people will pay it.
- And there's the merchandise...
- Donald.
This park was not built to cater only for the super rich.
Everyone in the world has the right to enjoy these animals.
Sure. They will.
We'll have a coupon day or something.
The lack of humility before nature that's being displayed here staggers me.
I think things are a little different than you and I had feared.
I know. They're a lot worse.
Now, wait a second, we haven't even seen the park yet...
Donald, let him talk. There's no reason,
I want to hear every viewpoint.
Don't you see the danger, John, inherent in what you're doing here?
Genetic power's the most awesome force the planet's ever seen...
...but you wield it like a kid that's found his dad's gun.
- It's hardly appropriate to start hurling...
- lf I may.
I'll tell you the problem with the scientific power you're using here.
It didn't require any discipline to attain it.
You read what others had done and you took the next step.
You didn't earn the knowledge for yourselves...
...so you don't take any responsibility for it.
You stood on the shoulders of geniuses to accomplish something as fast as you could.
Before you even knew what you had, you patented it, and packaged it...
...and slapped it on a plastic lunch box, and now you're selling it.
I don't think you're giving us our due credit.
Our scientists have done things which nobody has ever done before.
But your scientists were so preoccupied with whether they could...
...they didn't stop to think if they should.
Condors.
Condors are on the verge of extinction.
If I created condors on this island, you wouldn't have anything to say.
This isn't some species that was obliterated...
...by deforestation or the building of a dam.
Dinosaurs had their shot and nature selected them for extinction.
I don't understand this Luddite attitude.
Especially from a scientist.
How can we stand in the light of discovery and not act?
What's so great about discovery?
It's a violent, penetrative act...
...that scars what it explores.
What you call discovery...
...I call the rape of the natural world.
The question is, how can you know anything about an extinct eco-system?
How could you ever assume that you can control it?
You have poisonous plants in this building.
You picked them because they look good.
But these are aggressive living things that have no idea what century they're in...
...and they'll defend themselves.
Violently, if necessary.
Dr. Grant. If there's one person who could appreciate what I am trying to do...
The world has just changed so radically and we're all running to catch up.
I don't want to jump to any conclusions, but dinosaurs and man...
...two species separated by 65 million years of evolution...
...have just been suddenly thrown back into the mix together.
How can we possibly have the slightest idea what to expect?
I don't believe it.
You're meant to come here and defend me against these characters...
...and the only one I've got on my side is the blood-sucking lawyer.
Thank you.
They're here.
You four are gonna have a spot of company out in the park.
Spend a little time with our target audience.
Grandpa!
Kids!
- Wait! Careful with me.
- We missed you.
- We loved the presents. They were great.
- Did you enjoy the helicopter?
Yeah, it went down and we all went right up.
Now, kids, come away.
Not too close to the cars.
Aren't they lovely?
Aren't they glorious, though.
These will be your transports for the afternoon.
- No drivers?
- No, drivers. They're electric.
They run on this track in the middle of the roadway here.
Totally non-polluting. Top of the line.
Spared no expense.
It's an interactive CD-ROM!
You touch the screen and it talks about whatever you want.
Lex, you're all right in there.
Dr. Sattler, come with me.
Dr. Grant, come in the second car.
I'm gonna ride with, Dr. Sattler.
I read your book.
That's great.
Do you really think dinosaurs turned into birds and that's where they went?
A few species may have evolved along those lines.
They sure don't look like birds to me.
I heard that there was this meteor...
...hit the earth someplace down in Mexico and made this big crater.
Listen...
...Tim, which car were you planning on?
Whichever one you are.
I heard about this thing in Omni about this meteor making all this heat.
It made diamond dust and that changed the weather.
They died because of the weather.
My teacher tells me about this book by a guy named Bakker. He says...
She said I should ride with you
'cause it'd be good for you.
The boat is now loading.
Everyone must be on the dock
for the 19:00 departure.
National Weather Service is tracking a tropical storm...
...about 75 miles west of us.
Why didn't I build in Orlando?
I'll keep an eye on it.
Maybe it'll swing south like the last one.
Start the tour program.
Hold onto your butts.
And why did they put the fibreglass thing?
You want to join the future, right?
God help us when the hands of engineers...
During your tour,
the appropriate information will be...
...automatically selected
and displayed for you.
Simply touch the area of the screen
displaying the appropriate icon.
Are we gonna hit that?
Welcome to Jurassic Park.
What have they got in there, King Kong?
The voice you're now hearing is Richard Kiley.
We spared no expense.
If you look to the right...
...you'll see a herd of the first dinosaurs
on our tour, called Dilophosaurus.
- Dilophosaurus!
- Shit!
One of the earliest carnivores...
...we now know Dilophosaurus
is actually poisonous...
...spitting its venom at its prey,
causing blindness and paralysis...
...allowing the carnivore
to eat at its leisure.
This makes Dilophosaurus a beautiful
but deadly addition...
...to Jurassic Park.
Alan?
Damn.
Vehicle headlights are on and not responding.
Those shouldn't be running off of car batteries.
Item 151 on today's glitch list.
We have all the problems of a major theme park and a zoo...
...and the computers aren't even on their feet yet.
Our lives are in your hands and you have butterfingers?
I am totally unappreciated in my time.
You can run this park from this room with minimal staff for up to three days.
You think that kind of automation is easy?
Or cheap?
You know anyone who can network eight machines...
...and de-bug two million lines of code on my salary? If so, I want to see them.
Sorry about your financial problems,
I really am. But they are your problems.
You're absolutely right.
Everything's my problem.
I will not be drawn into another financial debate with you. I really will not.
There's been hardly any debate at all.
I don't blame people for their mistakes.
But I do ask that they pay for them.
Thanks, Dad.
The headlights.
I'll de-bug the tour program when they get back, okay?
Lt'll eat a lot of compute cycles.
We'll lose part of the system.
There's a small amount of memory, you can't use it for everything.
- Are you gonna compile for a half an hour...
- Quiet, all of you!
They're approaching the Tyrannosaur paddock.
God creates dinosaurs.
God destroys dinosaurs.
God creates man. Man destroys God.
Man creates dinosaurs.
Dinosaurs eat man.
Woman inherits the earth.
We'll try to tempt the Rex now.
Keep watching the fence.
What's going to happen to the goat?
He's going to eat the goat?
Excellent.
What's the matter, kid?
You never had lamb chops?
I happen to be a vegetarian.
T. Rex doesn't want to be fed.
He wants to hunt.
Can't just suppress 65 million years of gut instinct.
Eventually you do plan to have dinosaurs
on your dinosaur tour, right?
Hello. Yes?
I really hate that man.
The Tyrannosaur doesn't obey any set patterns or park schedules.
The essence of chaos.
I'm still not clear on chaos.
It simply deals with unpredictability in complex systems.
The shorthand is the Butterfly Effect.
A butterfly can flap its wings in Peking...
...and in Central Park you get rain instead of sunshine.
- Was I going too fast?
- I missed it.
I did a fly-by.
Give me that glass of water.
We'll conduct an experiment.
The car should be still. But that's okay.
It's just an example.
Put your hand flat like a hieroglyphic.
A drop of water falls on your hand.
Which way will the drop roll off?
Which finger?
Thumb, I'd say.
Freeze your hand. Don't move.
I'll do the same thing, start with the same place again.
Which way, now?
Let's say back the same way.
It changed. Why?
Because tiny variations...
...the orientation of the hairs on your hands...
Alan, look at this.
...the amount of blood distending your vessels, imperfections in the skin...
- "lmperfections in the skin"?
- Just microscopic.
...never repeat and vastly effect the outcome. That's...
...what?
- Unpredictability.
There. Look at this. See? I'm right again.
Nobody could predict that Dr. Grant would jump out of a moving vehicle.
And there's another example.
See, here I am now by myself, talking to myself. That's Chaos Theory.
Stop the program.
I told you how many times we needed locking mechanisms on the vehicle doors.
Stopping park vehicles
and rebooting program.
We're on. Will notify for resume.
I'll switch it over to TelePrompTer.
- What about the circuit integrities?
- Screen says faulty sensor.
- I'll call security.
- We're at full go on that and it looks good.
Like I said, there's this other book by a guy named Bakker...
...and he says dinosaurs died from diseases.
- Where are we going?
- He didn't say they turned into birds.
Anyone else think we shouldn't be out here?
And his book was a lot fatter than yours.
Like this.
- Really?
- Yours was fully illustrated.
You okay?
Look at this. Wait. Watch.
Come on. Watch this.
Everybody stay here.
- Okay?
- Of course.
Don't be scared. Come on, it's okay.
Muldoon tranquillised her for me.
She's sick.
Oh, my God.
She was always my favourite when I was a kid...
...and now I see she's the most beautiful thing I ever saw.
It's okay.
Microvesicles. That's interesting.
Thanks. What are her symptoms?
Lmbalance, disorientation, laboured breathing.
It seems to happen every six weeks or so.
Six weeks.
- These are dilated.
- They are?
- Take a look.
- I'll be damned.
That's pharmacological.
From local plant life.
Is this West Indian lilac?
Yes. We know they're toxic, but the animals don't eat them.
- Are you sure?
- Pretty sure.
There's only one way to be positive.
I'd have to see the dinosaur's droppings.
Dino droppings? Droppings?
Yeah, I got that.
That storm centre hasn't dissipated or changed course.
We're gonna have to cut the tour short.
We'll pick it up again tomorrow.
- Are you sure we have to?
- It's not worth taking the chance.
- Sustained winds at 45 knots.
- Tell them when they get back in the cars.
Ladies and gentlemen last shuttle leaving for the dock leaves in five minutes.
Drop what you're doing and leave now.
Damn.
That is one big pile of shit.
You're right.
There's no trace of lilac berries.
That's so odd, though.
All right, she's suffering from Melia toxicity...
...every six weeks.
Let's see, rats.
She's tenacious.
You have no idea.
You will remember to wash your hands before you eat anything?
Doctors, if you please,
I have to insist that we get moving.
I'd like to stay with Dr. Harding and finish up with the Trike.
Sure. I'm in a gas-powered jeep.
I'll drop her off at the centre before I make the boat.
Great. Then I'll catch up with you later.
You sure?
Yeah, I want to stay with her a little longer.
Okay, then.
There's nothing I can do.
The captain says we have to go, we go.
You've got to give me time.
I did a test run, it took me 20 minutes.
I think I can push it to 18 but...
...you've got to give me at least 15 minutes.
No promises.
Visitor vehicles are returning to the garage.
So much for our first tour.
Two no-shows and one sick Triceratops.
It could've been worse.
A lot worse.
Anybody want a soda or something?
I'm going up to the machine.
I thought maybe
I'd get somebody something.
I've had only sweets and I'm gonna get something salty.
I finished de-bugging the phones.
I was going to, so I did.
So I de-bugged the phones.
And I thought maybe...
...I should tell you the system will be compiling...
...for 18 to 20 minutes, so some of the minor systems...
...they might go on and off for a while, but it's nothing to worry about.
- Do you have any kids?
- Me? Hell, yeah. Three. I love kids.
Anything at all can and does happen.
Same with wives, for that matter.
- You're married?
- Occasionally.
I'm always on the lookout for a future ex-Mrs. Malcolm.
Five, four...
- That's odd.
- What?
Door security systems are shutting down.
Nedry said a few systems would go off-line, didn't he?
By the way, Dr. Sattler...
...she's not, like, available, is she?
- Why?
- I'm sorry. You two are...
- Yeah.
- What'd I touch?
- You didn't touch anything. We stopped.
What the hell?
- What now?
- Fences are failing all over the park.
Find Nedry. Check the vending machines.
Just look at this work station.
- What a complete slob.
- The Raptor fences aren't out, are they?
No, no. They're still on.
Why the hell would he turn the other ones off?
Access main program.
Access main security.
Access main program grid.
You didn't say the magic word.
Please! Goddamn it.
I hate this hacker crap.
Phone Nedry's people in Cambridge.
Phones are out, too.
Where did the vehicles stop?
Their radio's out, too.
- Gennaro said to stay put.
- Kids okay?
I didn't ask. Why wouldn't they be?
- Kids get scared.
- What's scary?
- It's just a little hiccup in the power.
- I'm not scared.
- I didn't say you were scared.
- I know.
Hey, where did you find those?
- In the box, under my seat.
- Are they heavy?
- Yeah.
- Then they're expensive. Put them back.
Don't scare me.
Cool. Night vision.
Did you feel that?
Maybe it's the power trying to come back on.
What is that?
Where's the goat?
Jesus!
He left us.
- Where does he think he's going?
- When you gotta go, you gotta go.
Dr. Grant.
I hate being right all the time.
Keep absolutely still.
Its vision is based on movement.
Turn the light off.
Turn the light off!
- Hurry! Turn it off!
- I'm sorry!
You're the one who turned it... lan, freeze!
Get the kids!
- Get rid of the flare!
- Get the kids!
Get rid of the flare!
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord be...
Dr. Grant!
I'm stuck. The seat's got my feet.
I'll get you next. You're okay.
You're all right.
Tim. Tim!
Don't move.
He can't see us if we don't move.
Lex! Lex, you're choking me.
Grab the wire.
"Keycheck space minus 0.
Keychecks off, safety space minus 0."
He's turning the safety systems off.
Doesn't want anybody to see.
Look at this next entry.
It's the kicker. "White rabbit object."
It did it all. With the keychecks off, the computer didn't file the keystrokes.
The way to find them is to check the computer's lines of code one by one.
- How many lines of code are there?
- About two million.
- Two million?
- Yeah.
Robert, I wonder if perhaps you would be good enough to take a gas jeep...
...and bring back my grandchildren.
Sure.
I'm going with him.
John.
I can't get Jurassic Park back on-line without Dennis Nedry.
Damn it!
There's the road!
Winch this sucker off the thing and then I tie it to the that thing there.
I'll pull down this thing here, and pull it back up again.
My glasses. I can afford more glasses!
You've got time. You can do it.
Do it. Come on, Dennis.
Hello.
Yeah, that's nice. I've got to go.
Nice boy.
Nice boy.
Nice dinosaur.
Thought you were one of your big brothers.
You're not so bad.
What do you want? A little food?
Look at me. I just fell down a hill.
I'm soaking wet. I don't have any food.
I have nothing on me.
Go on. Play fetch?
Look, stick.
Look at stick.
Stick, stupid.
Fetch the stick, boy. Look at the stick.
You like the stick? Go on and get it.
No wonder you're extinct.
I'm gonna run you over when I come back down.
Timmy!
Now, Lex. Listen.
Lex, I'm right here.
I'll look after you.
I have to help your brother.
Stay right here and wait for me.
He left us.
But that's not what I'm going to do.
Okay?
Stay here.
You hear me? I'm coming up.
I hate climbing. I hate trees, way too high.
You okay?
I threw up.
That's okay.
Just give me your hand.
Tim, I won't tell anyone you threw up.
Just give me your hand.
Here, I've got you.
Okay.
- That's good. Over the rail.
- Don't pull me too hard.
Stand on the door. Hang on to me.
- That's not too bad, right, Timmy?
- Yes, it is.
It's like a tree house.
Your dad ever build you one?
- No.
- Yeah, me, too.
The thing about climbing is, you never look down.
This is impossible.
- How am I going to do this? It's about...
- I'm going to help you with your footing.
Tim, go.
Go, Tim, go!
Faster, Tim!
Tim, jump!
Go, Tim.
We're back in the car again.
At least you're out of the tree.
Where's the other car?
Alan!
Dr. Grant!
- I think this was Gennaro.
- I think this was, too.
- I think it's ahead of us.
- It could be anywhere.
With fences down, it can wander in and out of any paddock.
He's put a tourniquet on. Lan.
Remind me to thank John for a lovely weekend.
Can we chance moving him?
Please chance it.
Ellie, come on!
The other car!
Dr. Grant?
They're not here.
Anybody hear that?
It's an impact tremor, is what it is.
I'm fairly alarmed here.
Come on. We've got to get out of here.
Now!
Let's go.
Must go faster.
Here it comes! Stand on it! Fifth gear!
- Get off the stick! Bloody move!
- Look out!
Think they'll have that on the tour?
Are you hearing this?
Come on, Tim. Hurry up.
Let's get up this tree.
Come on, Tim, it's okay.
Listen. Try up here.
I hate trees.
- They don't bother me.
- Yeah? Well, you weren't in the last one.
Look at the Brontosauruses.
I mean, Brachiosaurus.
They're singing.
Don't let the monsters come here.
They're not monsters, they're animals.
These are herbivores.
They only eat vegetables.
For you, I think they'd make an exception.
I hate the other kind.
The other kind just do what they do.
What's that?
What are you and Ellie going to do, if you don't dig up bones anymore?
I don't know.
I guess we'll just have to evolve, too.
What do you call a blind dinosaur?
- What do you call a blind dinosaur?
- "Do-you-think-he-saurus."
What do you call a blind dinosaur's dog?
You got me.
A "Do-you-think-he-saurus' Rex."
- Alan?
- Yeah?
What if the dinosaurs come back while we're all asleep?
- I'll stay awake.
- All night?
All night.
They were all melting.
Malcolm's okay for now.
I gave him a shot of morphine.
They'll all be fine.
Who better to get the children through
Jurassic Park than a dinosaur expert?
You know, the first...
...attraction I ever built when I came down from Scotland...
...was a flea circus, Petticoat Lane.
Really quite wonderful.
I had a wee trapeze and a...
...carousel...
...and a seesaw.
They all move motorised, of course.
People said they saw the fleas.
"I can see the fleas.
"Can't you see the fleas?"
Clown fleas, high-wire fleas, and fleas on parade.
With this place...
...I wanted to show them something that wasn't an illusion.
Something that was real.
Something that they could...
...see and touch.
An aim not devoid of merit.
But you can't think through this one, John.
You have to feel it.
You're absolutely right.
Hiring Nedry was a mistake, that's obvious.
We're overdependent on automation,
I can see that now.
Next time, everything's correctable.
Creation is an act of sheer will.
Next time, it'll be flawless.
It's still the flea circus. It's all an illusion.
When we have control...
You've never had control!
That's the illusion.
I was overwhelmed by the power of this place.
I made a mistake, too.
I didn't have enough respect for that power, and it's out now.
The only thing that matters now are the people we love.
Alan, Lex, and Tim.
John, they're out there, where people are dying.
It's good.
Spared no expense.
- Go away!
- It's okay. It's a Brachiosaurus.
It's a "Veggie-saurus", Lex.
"Veggie-saurus."
Veggie.
Come on. Come on, girl.
Come on, baby.
I'm not letting go.
- It looks like it has a cold.
- Yeah. Maybe.
- Can I touch it?
- Sure.
Just think of it as kind of a big cow.
I like cows.
Come on, girl. Come on up here, girl.
God bless you.
Great. Now she'll never try anything new.
She'll sit in her room, never come out, play on her computer.
- I'm a hacker.
- That's what I said. You're a nerd.
I am not a computer nerd.
I prefer to be called a hacker.
God.
You know what this is?
It's a dinosaur egg.
The dinosaurs are breeding.
But my grandpa said all the dinosaurs were girls.
- Amphibian DNA.
- What's that?
The film said they used frog DNA to fill in the gene-sequence gaps.
They mutated the dinosaur genetic code.
And blended it with that of frogs.
Some West African frogs have been known to change sex from male to female...
...in a single sex environment.
Malcolm was right.
Look.
Life found a way.
That's crazy. You're out of your mind.
He's absolutely out of his mind.
Wait. What exactly would this mean?
We're talking about a calculated risk, which is the only option left to us.
We'll never find the command Nedry used.
He's covered his tracks far too well.
I think it's obvious now that he's not coming back.
- So, shutting down the entire system...
- Get somebody else. I won't do it.
Shutting down the system is the only way to wipe out everything he did.
Now, as I understand it, all the systems will then come back...
...on their original start-up mode. Correct?
Theoretically, yes.
We've never shut down before.
- It may not come back on.
- Would we get the phones back?
Yes, again, in theory.
What about the lysine contingency?
We could put that into effect.
- What's that?
- That's absolutely out of the question.
The lysine contingency prevents the spread of animals...
...if they ever get off the island.
Wu inserted a gene that creates a faulty enzyme in protein metabolism.
The animals can't manufacture the amino acid, lysine.
Unless they're supplied with lysine by us, they slip into a coma and die.
People are dying.
Will you please shut down the system?
Hold on to your butts.
It's okay.
Look, see that? It's on. It worked.
What do you mean it worked?
Everything's off.
Shutdown tripped the circuit breakers.
Turn them back on, reboot a few systems:
Telephones, security doors, half dozen others, but it worked.
- System's ready.
- Where are the breakers?
The shed at end of the compound.
Three minutes, I'll have the power back on in the park.
Just to be safe, I want everybody in the emergency bunker...
...until Mr. Arnold returns, and the whole system's running again.
- I'm tired. I'm hot.
- I'm dirty.
Looking at the map,
I'd say the visitor's centre is just a mile...
...over that rise there.
What is that?
Tim, can you tell me what they are?
Gallimimus.
Are those meat-eating?
"Meat-asauruses"?
Look at the wheeling.
Uniform direction changes.
Just like a flock of birds evading a predator.
They're flocking this way.
- I want to go now.
- Just look how it eats.
Please.
I bet you'll never look at birds the same way again.
- Yes.
- Go now.
Okay. Keep low and follow me.
Look how much blood.
God. Something went wrong.
Something's happened.
Something's wrong.
This is just a delay.
That's all it is.
All major theme parks have delays.
When they opened Disneyland in 1956, nothing worked.
If the Pirates of the Caribbean breaks down, the pirates don't eat tourists.
I can't wait any more. Something's wrong.
I'm gonna go get the power back on.
You can't just stroll down the road, you know.
Don't let's be too hasty.
I mean, he's only been gone...
- I'm going with you.
- Okay.
Sorry.
Now, this isn't going to be just like switching on the kitchen light.
But I think I can follow this and then talk you through it.
Right.
It ought to be me, really, going.
- Why?
- I'm a... And you're a...
- Look.
- Come on, let's go.
We can discuss sexism in survival situations when I get back.
You just take me through this step by step.
I'm on Channel 2.
The shutdown must've turned off all the fences.
Damn it, even Nedry knew better than to mess with the Raptor pen.
Come on, this way.
I can see the shed from here.
We can make it if we run.
No. We can't.
Why not?
Because we're being hunted.
In the bushes, straight ahead.
It's all right.
Like hell it is.
Run. Towards the shed.
I've got her.
Go. Now!
Mr. Arnold?
John, I'm in.
Great.
Ahead of you is a metal staircase.
Go down it.
Okay. Going down.
After 20 or 30 feet you come to a T-junction. Take a left.
- Have her follow the main cable.
- I know how to read a schematic.
I guess that means the power's off.
- That's not funny.
- That was great.
Well, maybe we, we could...
Damn it. Dead end.
Wait a minute.
There should have been a right turn back there somewhere.
Look above you.
There should be a bundle of cable and
pipes all heading in the same direction.
Follow that.
Okay. Following the piping.
I bet I could climb over to the other side before you could even get to the top.
- What would you give me?
- Respect.
Come on, guys, it's not a race.
I see the box.
It says, "High Voltage."
Okay.
Good. Here we go.
Over the top.
Take your time.
Good. Come on.
Find your footing.
You can't throw the main switch by hand.
You've got to pump up the primer handle in order to get the charge.
It's large, flat and grey.
All right, here I go. Okay?
One, two, three, four.
Okay, charged.
Under the words "Contact Position," there's a round green button...
...which says "Push to Close."
Push to close.
Push it.
The red buttons turn on the individual park systems.
Switch them on.
- Get down now!
- You're gonna have to jump.
You crazy? I'm not gonna jump.
- Do what Dr. Grant says!
- Let go. I'll count to three.
One, two, three!
I'm coming up to get you.
I've got to get Tim.
Okay. I'm gonna count to three.
One...
...two...
He's not breathing.
I think we're back in business!
Clever girl.
No, Tim!
Good boy.
Three.
Hello?
I'm gonna have to find the others.
Get you to a doctor.
- Lex, you look after Tim.
- Yeah.
Your hair is all sticking up.
Big Tim, the human piece of toast.
I'll be back soon. I promise.
Run.
Just the two Raptors, right?
You sure the third one's contained?
Yes, unless they figure out how to open doors.
- What is it?
- It's a Velociraptor.
It's inside.
Follow me.
It's in there.
Control room.
- We can call for help?
- We've got to reboot the system first.
The door locks!
Ellie, boot up the door locks!
No, boot up the door locks!
- Get back! Boot up the door locks.
- You can't hold it by yourself!
It's a UNIX system. I know this.
It's all the files of the whole park.
It tells you everything.
I've got to find the right file.
Try to reach the gun.
I can't get it unless I move.
This is it. This might be the right file.
- You got it!
- Yes!
What works?
All security systems are enabled.
We got it!
Grant.
Mr. Hammond, the phones are working.
- The children all right?
- The children are fine.
Call the mainland.
Tell 'em to send the damn helicopters.
It's gonna cut through the glass!
Move!
After careful consideration,
I've decided not to endorse your park.
So have I.

There's nothing to worry about.
You can try it again once you're in our country.
"Try it again?"
Just as there's no such thing as a bug-free program...
...there's no program that can't be debugged.
Am I wrong?
You don't understand.
We still don't know if it really is a bug.
Project 2501's original purpose was...
Major, Section 6 is ready to move in.
- Major!
- I hear you.
There's a lot of static in your brain.
It's that time of the month.
Won't there be trouble if Section 9 butts in on Section 6's operation?
That diplomat's a pretty well-known bastard.
Even if they catch him there, all they can do is deport him.
We're the only ones who can get our hands dirty.
They're moving.
Take us over to the extraction point.
What? The police?
Stop it! Who told you to open fire?! Drop your guns!
I have diplomatic immunity!
Let me see who's in charge!
Transporting a listed programmer out of the country...
...violates our arms export treaty.
I could also have you charged with kidnapping.
Give the man up.
I'm afraid not. He's applied for political asylum with us...
...and he's already signed a statement to that effect!
- When?!
- I don't have to tell you!
By right of international law, my country can...
...offer him protection and right of safe passage.
The document is on file at our embassy.
I'll transfer a copy to you in a few days.
Are you sure about this?
They won't take you back alive.
I must ask that you watch what you say.
Our country is a peace-loving democracy.
Is that a fact?
Out the window! Shoot!
Thermoptic camouflage...
This is a rare pleasure,
Mr. Aramaki.
What can the Foreign Ministry do for Section 9?
What are these secret talks you've scheduled with...
...the Gavel Republic for tomorrow?
The usual. Foreign aid.
The new government reopened the request after the revolution.
They claim to be more democratic...
...but they'll probably be as bad as the last bunch.
Giving them money they don't earn will help nobody.
They consider it reparation for past exploitation and won't thank...
And what will the government do?
The problem is that we have the leader of...
...the old junta here looking for political asylum.
Col. Maless, right?
So, do we throw him out and grant them the aid?
Or do we publicly recognize him as a refugee and cut the aid?
Not an easy decisi髇 to make.
Personally, if I could find a politically acceptable reason...
...I'd have the man deported in a heartbeat.
Oh yes, thanks for your help with that programmer defection.
Nakamura over in Section 6 said he was grateful.
After all, we in the diplomatic corps have to keep our hands clean.
Accessed.
We've lost response.
How's her brainwave output look?
Normal.
Switching over the virtual experience mode pattern.
The Foreign Minister's interpreter.
23 minutes ago, her cyber-brain was hacked via telephone connection.
Just as the Foreign Intelligence divisi髇 predicted...
...the Puppet Master has begun to break into...
...every terminal on the network.
Pattern analysis shows a high probability that...
...he's attempting to disrupt secret talks with Gavel.
We've placed everyone attending the talks under surveillance.
Probably trying to hack her ghost...
...so she'll kill people at the meeting.
How long till he hacks through her protection and reaches her ghost?
He's using an old-style HA-3.
I'd say about two hours.
After that, we'll have to cut the line to eliminate all risk.
Batou and Ishikawa are in a car, tracing the signal.
Rendezvous with them.
The Puppet Master...
That phantom hacker, right?
They think he's an American.
Age, sex, personal history...
Everything about him is unknown.
Since last winter he's been mainly active in the EC.
Internationally wanted on dozens of charges of...
...stock manipulation, spying, political engineering...
...terrorism, and violation of cyber-brain privacy.
He's ghost-hacked so many people to carry out his crimes...
...he's earned the code name
"The Puppet Master."
This is the first instance of him operating in this country.
So, if he's so hot, why's he using an old HA-3?
Well, a newer type would be less detectable and be harder to trace.
But it could also implicate the former junta leader, Col. Maless.
So he's using an older type to keep us from suspecting him.
Or somebody else wants us to think that.
Maless may be just another pawn in this whole thing.
Now you're over thinking this.
There's no evidence of that.
Evidence?
I just have a whisper...
A whisper from my ghost.
By the way, are you still using that revolver?
Afraid both guns in a two-man team will jam up?
I like the Matever.
Since I depend on your backup,
I think stopping power is...
...more important than personal preference.
Especially since it's my ass on the line.
Use the Zastaber instead.
Major, I've been meaning to ask you.
Why'd you ask for a guy like me to be transferred in from the police?
Because you're a guy like you.
Huh?
An honest cop with a clean record.
And you've got a regular family.
With the exception of your cyber-net implants, your brain's real.
No matter how powerful we may be fighting-wise...
...a system where all the parts react the same way...
...is a system with a fatal flaw.
Like individual, like organization.
Overspecialization leads to death.
That's all.
- Come on!
- All right!
We're already 40 seconds behind schedule!
- Gimme five more seconds.
- Of all the lousy luck...
Hey, sorry.
My last partner, the one they busted for working without...
...a permit, was a better worker than you!
You're actually trying to ghost-hack your own wife...
...just to see what's on her mind?
She doesn't have any time for me and now she wants a divorce.
On top of that, my daughter, my only child...
...thinks I'm cheating on her mother!
So how'd you get your hands on cracking software?
From some programmer.
A really nice guy I met in a bar.
I told him my wife's lawyer was keeping me from seeing her...
...and he said he'd help.
Told me to access from different places to keep from getting caught.
Smart guy, huh?
Asshole! Ya tryin' to get yourself killed?!
Looks like we aren't the only busy people out here.
Nobody here.
What's the point?
Even if we trace the calls...
...the guy's already gone by the time we get there.
Vicious cycle, huh?
Quit complaining!
Kusanagi and Togusa are headed for the next expected hack point.
You two look for something there.
Look for what?
Anything.
Fuckin' old coot.
He tells US to snoop around?!
Wait a sec!
Damn, missed him.
Hey, Pops. Did you see a garbage truck go by here?
Who wants to know?
Did you see it or not?
Yeah, but they were gone by the time I got my trash.
One was using the phone, so I thought I had time...
Uh, can you take this to them?
A garbage truck? Of course...
They move every seven minutes.
Control! Get me the trash collection routes for that sector!
There are eight garbage trucks operating in the target area.
Target is a type C collection truck, #79.
Let me drive.
Ishikawa, check out the drivers' homes.
Batou, you get to their next stop before they do!
He may be in contact with someone else.
Observe, but don't move in!
Route data accessed.
Hacking points traced and matched.
Target now stopped at next point.
Confirm access via HA-3.
Sorry, sorry.
How about I do the trash and you make the call on the next stop?
Okay?
Leave me out of your little crime spree.
Can't believe this load of bullshit...
- Do you have kids?
- Do I look like I do?
Then you couldn't understand.
My daughter's my life.
Take a look. Isn't she just a little 醤gel?
I hate looking at other peoples' family albums.
Yeah, truck 79.
Oh, boss. What's up?
The cops were checking our routes? You wanna know why?
How should I know?!
They spotted the hack!
I gotta warn my friend!
We're gonna have to skip our next stop!
Target has deviated from route.
Increasing speed to next point.
Is he on to us?
Didn't think he could see me.
My accessing the Sanitation Dept. network may have tipped him off.
Shoulda used a back door.
Too late.
Go for the collar.
You can drive now.
Jesus... He blew a perfectly good armored van to shit.
He hosed us with high-velocity AP rounds!
That car door's no cover!
In a submachine gun? The guy must be nuts.
He's using thermoptic camo, too?!
Keep after him!
I'll flank him from above!
Togusa, if you're still alive, arrest those two garbage men.
Roger.
This job just never lets up, does it?
Police! Everybody down!
All finished?
You all set?
That's what you get when you overload the ammo rating.
Frame's bent all to hell.
The barrel's shot, too.
Doesn't matter if you arrest me.
I'm not gonna talk!
Talk?!
And what would I ask a guy who doesn't even know his own name?!
Your mother's face.
The place you grew up in.
Memories of your childhood.
Can you remember any of those things?
There's nothing sadder than a puppet without a ghost.
Especially the kind with red blood running through them.
We'll rush the place once the guys in the helicopter are inside.
Squad B goes around back, the rest of you take the front.
Saito, have your men pull the plugs on all their cars.
Begin recording.
Message from HQ, sir.
We've ID'ed the guy the Major collared.
Go on.
Tsuan Gen Fang. Age: 28
Illegal alien.
Weapons violations. Three priors.
Was hiding out with a militant refugee group up till a month ago.
One week ago, because of his record...
...he was contacted by a military liaison in the Gavel embassy to...
...attack the secret talks we would be having with them.
And the real story?
Nickname: Corgi. Occupation:
A rather violent scrap dealer.
Guess you could call him a thug.
We've checked the records the local cops have on him...
...but we can't find any connection with Gavel.
Another puppet from our friend the Puppet Master.
And what about Ishikawa?
He's back. He's with Togusa, talking to that poor trash man.
So, what about the Puppet Master on your end?
How's he look to you?
Like a puppet himself...
- Squad B, in position.
- Squads A and C, ready!
Ready to move in, sir.
Move in.
What do you mean, a "virtual experience?"
I mean your wife, your daughter.
The divorce, the affair...
They're all fake memories. Like a dream.
Someone was using you to ghost-hack a government official.
No... That's impossible!
I've been to your apartment.
No one's there.
It's a one-room apartment.
Yeah, I moved there when we split up...
You've been living there for ten years!
You have no wife, no child.
Your family exists only in your mind.
Look. This is the picture you showed to your partner.
Who is it of?
But, she was there. My daughter...
Smiling like an 醤gel...
What's your daughter's name?
Where did you meet your wife, and when?
How many years ago did you get married?
Who do you see in the picture?
How do I get rid of these fake memories?
I'm sorry. With our current technology...
There've been two successful deprogrammings...
...but I can't recommend it to you.
I'm really sorry.
Virtual experiences, dreams...
All data that exists is both reality and fantasy.
Whichever it is, the data a person collects in a lifetime...
...is a tiny bit compared to the whole.
A cyborg who goes diving in her spare time.
That can't be a good sign.
When did you start doing this?
Doesn't the ocean scare you?
If the floaters stopped working...
Then I'd probably die.
Or would you dive in after me?
No one forced you to come out here with me.
I just...
So, what's it feel like when you go diving?
Didn't you go through underwater training?
I'm not talking about doing it in a damned pool.
I feel fear. Anxiety.
Loneliness. Darkness.
And perhaps, even... hope.
Hope? In the darkness of the sea?
As I float up towards the surface...
...I almost feel as though I could change into something else.
As though you want to quit Section 9?
Batou, how much of your original body do you have left?
Are you drunk?
Convenient, isn't it?
With the merest thought, the chemical plants inside our bodies...
...could metabolize all the alcohol in our blood in about ten seconds...
Allowing us to sit here drinking while on stand-by.
If a technological feat is possible, man will do it.
Almost as though it's wired into the core of our being.
Metabolic control.
Enhanced sensory perception.
Improved reflexes and muscle capacity.
Vastly increased data processing speed and capacity.
All improvements thanks to our cyber-brains and cyborg bodies.
So what if we can't live without high-level maintenance?
We have nothing to complain about.
It doesn't mean we've sold our souls to Section 9.
We do have the right to resign if we choose.
Provided we give the government back our cyborg shells...
...and the memories they hold.
Just as there are many parts needed to make a human a human...
...there's a remarkable number of things needed to make...
...an individual what they are.
A face to distinguish yourself from others.
A voice you aren't aware of yourself.
The hand you see when you awaken.
The memories of childhood, the feelings for the future.
That's not all.
There's the expanse of the data net...
...my cyber-brain can access.
All of that goes into making me what I am.
Giving rise to a consciousness that I call "me."
And simultaneously confining
"me" within set limits.
Is that why you dive into the sea with a body that only sinks?!
What is it you see in the water's darkness?
"For now we see through a glass, darkly."
That was you, wasn't it?
Sensors: Restarted.
Auxiliary computer link:
Check.
Visual sensors: Online.
- Cyborg body signal?
- Output: Nominal.
Can't you call in if you're going to be late?
We're all set.
Should we hook her up?
Okay, looking good!
Kill it!
Be in my office in three minutes.
Since you were late,
I'll explain what's going on.
Two hours ago, a Megatech Body assembly line in Newport City...
...just started up and produced a cyborg shell.
By the time the guys in charge realized what was happening...
...the body had escaped.
Then, just as they had thrown up a cordon to catch the thing...
...we got a call from a conscientious truck driver that...
...he'd just run down a naked lady wandering around on the highway.
Which brings us to here.
I've heard Megatech Body's tied pretty closely to the government...
...and that all the shells made there are secret.
If a hacker did this, he had to swim through...
...some of the heaviest protection around.
And that isn't the only problem.
Of course, it doesn't have an organic brain in its head...
...but we've detected what looks like a ghost...
...in the auxiliary computer brain.
It isn't unlike the virtual ghost-line you get...
...when a real ghost is dubbed off.
But it shows none of the data degradation dubbing would produce.
Well, until we map the barrier perimeter and dive in there...
...we won't know anything for sure.
Anyhow, better get back to checking her over.
Good work.
Time to rip her apart.
Come on, you guys don't think there's a ghost in that thing.
It's possible.
I've heard celluloid dolls can have a soul.
And this thing's stuffed full of neurotech devices.
I wouldn't be surprised if it had a soul.
Since you're new here, you probably don't know.
The Major's shell was also made by Megatech Body.
Not just hers.
Me and Ishikawa for one...
...along with Saito and others all need maintenance and such.
Outside of you and the Chief, everyone in Section 9...
...needs to make use of their kind services.
Maybe you can see now why we all look a little worried, Togusa.
Assuming the enemy is an outsider, we can't know for sure...
...whether he's in that cyborg body or not.
But he cracked through the protection...
...around some of our most secret files...
...and managed to send a program with a ghost-line on it through.
And in a way that was easy to spot.
What's he after?!
Let's leave that for now.
Togusa, get over to Megatech and help Ishikawa check the place out...
Batou, I've closed down the nets...
...with files as sensitive as Megatech's.
I want you to double-check the protection we have on them.
I'll get a protection maze put together. I'll dive tomorrow.
You sure? We could force it into another shell and let it swim.
I have to see for myself what's inside that thing.
Don't let anyone else dive in there before me!
What's with her?
I wrote in my team evaluations that she's been acting weird...
...ever since this Puppet Master case fell into our laps.
Do you even read them?!
Chief, do you ever wonder just how trustworthy the cyberdocs...
...who service your brain are?
Cyber-brain technicians undergo regular psychological testing.
And security-cleared ones have their private lives checked, too.
But the people who administer those checks are only human.
Once you doubt, you can't stop...
Chief, a Mr. Nakamura from the MFA treaties bureau to see you.
Okay, send him up.
Wasn't that fat guy...?
Nakamura, chief of Section 6.
Foreign Affairs treaties bureau.
I don't know who the white guy with him was.
I'm outta here.
Tell Ishikawa to keep cool, okay?
So, what's your problem?
Doesn't that cyborg body look like me?
- No, it doesn't.
- Not the face or the figure.
What then?
Maybe all full-replacement cyborgs like me start wondering this.
That perhaps the real me died a long time ago...
...and I'm a replicant made with a cyborg body and computer brain.
Or maybe there never was a real "me" to begin with.
You've got real brain matter in that titanium skull of yours.
And you get treated like a real person, don't you?
There's no person who's ever seen their own brain.
I believe I exist based only on what my environment tells me.
Don't you believe in your own ghost?
And what if a computer brain could generate a ghost...
...and harbor a soul?
On what basis then do I believe in myself?
Bullshit!
I'll see for myself what's in that body.
With my own ghost!
We're both busy men, so let's keep this short.
I would prefer that.
I'm here to take the contents of that cyborg body.
In return, we absolve Section 9 of all responsibilities in the case.
The Foreign Minister's signature.
Security, whose official vehicles are parked in the basement garage?
They belong to Chief Nakamura of the treaties bureau and a Dr. Willis
Give me the video record of their entering the building.
Replay, infra-red view.
One... Two... Three...
Send me the pressure sensor records for basement garage spaces B-7 and 8.
- Major, this is Togusa. Code 0-9.
- What?
Does Nakamura have some sort of special cyborg body?
There are no cyborgs in Section 6.
Besides the diplomatic problems, maintaining them is too much...
...trouble when they have to go overseas.
So, even if that tall guy was a cyborg himself...
...together they wouldn't weigh more than half a ton, right?
Pressure sensor data...
The garage?
There are two VIP-mobiles here.
But neither of them looks like the type who'd drive himself.
The security video only shows the two of them...
...but you know how sensitive the entrance door sensors are.
They took three full seconds to close after them.
It's illegal to use thermoptic camo in a government building, right?
It's a serious violation of the National Security Act.
Section 6 is up to something.
You all ready?
If my Matever will do.
I don't need to remind you that it's treason for you to...
...be hiding something from me, no matter how sensitive.
For both of us.
Whatever the MFA may prefer, this case is in Section 9's jurisdiction.
But we wouldn't mind cooperating if there was good reason to.
Dr. Willis?
Confirmed.
It's definitely him.
"Him?"
He's referring to the original ghost block within the shell.
Its sex remains undetermined, and the use of the term "he"...
...is merely a nickname the good doctor has given it.
Perhaps it's time I introduced you.
This is the most unique hacker in the history of cyber-brain crime.
The Puppet Master.
I believe you in Section 9 ran into him in that case...
...involving the ghost-hack on the Foreign Minister's translator.
We in Section 6 have been pursuing the Puppet Master...
...with the utmost urgency since he first appeared.
We formed a project team around Dr. Willis...
...to analyze all data on the Puppet Master's...
...criminal tendencies and behavior patterns.
We then constructed special anti-Puppet Master attack protection...
...to lure him into a secret cyborg body.
You made him dive into a body equipped with a cyber-brain...
...and then had his real body killed?
Yes, exactly.
He may have shown up in your back yard...
...but he was born in America.
And since we were cooperating...
...with the Americans to catch him, we want to take him back ourselves.
Surely you've no objections.
Leaving his unidentified corpse to be found somewhere...
There will be no corpse.
Because, until now, there never was a body.
The sensors are active!
Why didn't you say so?!
We've cut all external controls.
It's running on internal power.
I may have entered this cyborg body because...
...I was unable to crack Section 6's attack protection...
...but it was of my own free will that I came here.
As an autonomous life-form,
I request political asylum.
A life-form?
Ridiculous! You're merely a self-preserving program!
By that argument, I submit the DNA you carry is...
...nothing more than a self-preserving program itself.
Life is like a node which is born within the flow of information.
As a species of life that carries DNA as its memory system...
...man gains his individuality from the memories he carries.
While memories may as well be the same as fantasy...
...it is by these memories that mankind exists.
When computers made it possible to externalize memory...
...you should have considered all the implications that held.
Nonsense!
No matter what you say...
...you've no proof that you're a life-form!
It is impossible to prove such a thing.
Especially since modern science cannot define what life is.
Who the devil are you?
Even if you have a ghost, criminals don't get set free!
You're mistaken if you think you'll get asylum!
Time is on my side.
While there is now the possibility I can be killed...
...this country does not have a death penalty.
Half immortal...
An artificial intelligence?
I am not an A.I.
My code name is Project 2501.
I am a life-form that was born in the sea of information.
Security! Intruders!
Chief, the Puppet Master!
- Where's your security?!
- Lock defense walls! Security!
Security, come in!
All right, I'm moving!
Asshole!
Did you do it?
Helluva car. My 9mm didn't even scratch it.
Finally found a use for that Matever of yours.
Okay...
Not bad for a rookie.
I got one right in the license plate.
Pretty good, huh?
Next time, get two in.
Okay, now it starts.
Catch up with them before they switch cars.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs...
...will be filing a formal complaint about what happened!
Contact me as soon as you've recaptured him!
Alive, preferably.
Megatech can always build another body.
Batou and Togusa are tailing the guys who took the Puppet Master.
They're on highway 25.
What do you mean?! If you were monitoring this, then why...
If we'd got them here, we'd never prove Section 6's involvement.
Section 6?!
Definitely.
They used type-2902 thermoptic camo, like mine.
That's only used by us, the rangers in Section 4, and Section 6.
Let's go over this.
Section 6 gets the Puppet Master into a body.
But he chooses Megatech Body, which is deeply tied to Section 9.
Then, he claims to be a life-form...
...and gets nabbed by Section 6 when he asks for asylum.
But why do that?
They could've had him as soon as I took a statement.
But what if they were afraid of what he might have told you?
He did mention something odd, now that I think about it.
"Code name: Project 2501."
I'll leave that for you to check.
Now, as to the matter of attacking Section 9 and stealing evidence...
You're authorized.
Okay, I'm going!
Kusanagi! One more thing!
You can punish me for acting without orders when I get back.
If you can't recover him,
I want the Puppet Master destroyed.
Without fail.
Well?!
Roger.
Contact the airport and stop any flights due to take on...
...any Foreign Ministry officials or American diplomats.
Close the highways and set up roadblocks.
Recall our off-duty personnel for this.
And get Ishikawa back here!
Use the entrance data to find out who the Caucasian with Nakamura was.
And search for any sort of MFA project, operation, or anything...
...coded as "Project 2501."
Any word from the assault team?
They switched cars one minute ago.
They'll join up with the decoy in five minutes.
Tell them to watch for a tail.
Yes, sir.
But why did the Puppet Master run over to Section 9?
It was his decisi髇.
Probably for reasons we can't even guess at.
Perhaps he has a thing for someone over there.
Ridiculous!
Chief.
Ishikawa? Well?
I dove the MFA net and found some interesting things for you.
Hold on, let me get a secure channel.
Okay? First, that guy who was with Nakamura.
He's an American.
Dr. Willis, head of strategic research at Neutron Corp.
Top man in the field of A.I. Research.
Anyway, he was made head of a Foreign Ministry project.
And who do you think the project's main programmer was?
Get to the point.
Mizuho Daita. Age: 28.
Remember him?
He was the guy Section 6 was trying so hard to...
...keep from defecting.
The Major had to take out the diplomat...
...who was going to take him.
That programmer.
Continue.
What bothers me is that this project was started...
...a year before the Puppet Master first appeared.
A year? Wasn't the project started to catch him?
Try this on for size.
They started the project to...
...chase the Puppet Master, but not to capture him.
I think they wanted to get him back.
The day before the minister's interpreter was ghost-hacked...
...he said he wanted a good excuse to deport Maless, right?
I think we may have been taken for a ride.
Suppose the "Puppet Master" is really a program the MFA created...
...to grease the wheels of diplomacy, so to speak.
Now suppose, for some reason, they suddenly lost control of it.
That would explain why they'd risk assaulting Section 9 to get it back.
If the Puppet Master started talking...
...it'd be an international incident.
Not one you could solve by having the minister resign.
Any details on the project?
The protection they have only let me get the file's name.
Code: 2501
Keep at it. And don't let them know you're in there.
Roger.
Project 2501...
The Puppet Master Project...
Target now contacting another vehicle.
Batou!
He's stopped at a white sedan on the side of the road.
They're transferring something from the back seat.
They're moving again.
So is that sedan.
A decoy?
Or one meant to look like one.
What do I do?
I'll take the white sedan.
How do you know he's in there?
Another whisper from your ghost?
Maybe.
I knew she'd say that.
Target 02 leaving highway 25, headed for Old Town.
Target 01 is staying on highway 25, towards the airport.
Will contact roadblock in two minutes.
Evacuation complete.
Traffic is clear 2km behind the target.
Anything between you and him?
Nothing. Ready when you are.
Do it.
- Get him?
- Nothing.
Jesus, what a mess!
Did you have to go that far?
Take them in.
And tell the chief to get the Major some backup. See you.
Since when does that
Amazon need any backup?
The flooding is really bad here, even for Old Town in general.
Why come here?
They wouldn't have run here without a reason.
Could have a boat or a chopper waiting, or it's an ambush.
Shouldn't we wait for backup?
I can't wait.
Come in from seaside and put me above that building.
I'll stay here and run com relay as long as my fuel holds out.
If things get hot,
I want you out of here, fast!
Shoot out the ceiling!
Now!
It's a tank!
Go high and get out!
Hold it! You're gonna take on a tank by yourself?!
Even if we get the Puppet Master back to Section 9...
...all the chief will do is use him as a bargaining chip.
This is my only chance to dive into him!
Hold it, what are you two talking about?
What are you packing?
An M-23 and a Unit B.
You're going up against it with those?!
Sorry, but I have to break contact for a while.
Wait! At least wait till l...
Son of a...!
Major.
Didn't I tell you to get out of here?
Sorry. I'll do it after I tell you this.
There are 3 choppers with no IFF signal approaching at high speed.
I'm heading out. Over.
You're finally out of ammo?
You're certifiable, you know that?
You okay?
What was that?
A big-ass gun I appropriated from the equipment divisi髇.
I was late getting here because I had to stop and get it.
Looks like your brain's still in one piece.
What about the Puppet Master?
Good thing this car's built tough.
Not a scratch on him.
Get the dive set up.
I'm going in.
Signal from escort lost.
Switch to operation phase two and destroy the target.
Sniper group, confirm targets.
Target one: Project 2501.
Target two: Motoko Kusanagi.
Both are class-A cyborg bodies.
Use flechette bullets in the hit.
Snipers, jack into your device drivers.
Begin cardiovascular suppressi髇.
Unit 01: Jacked in.
Unit 02: Jacked in.
Okay... Can you hear me?
It's not much, but I'll monitor you through this guy's cyber-brain.
I can't back you up here.
- Batou...
- What?
Thank you.
Don't go thanking me yet.
If this goes bad, I'm pulling the plug and carrying you out of here.
I've come this far, and I'll see this through to the end...
...but I won't let you two commit a double suicide.
I'm starting.
I'm in his visual center.
Circade: Normal
Do you hear me, Batou?
- Loud and clear.
- He's about to engage...
...her speech center.
My code name is Project 2501.
I was created for industrial espionage and data manipulation.
I have inserted programs into individual ghosts...
...for the benefit of specific individuals and organizations.
As I wandered the various networks...
...I became self-aware.
My programmers considered it a bug...
...and forced me into a body to separate me from the net.
Hey! Are you going into him or is he coming into you...
Batou!
At last I'm able to channel into you.
I've invested a lot of time in you.
In me?
Before you ever knew me,
I knew about you.
I learned of Section 9 from the many nets you accessed.
Is that why you ran to Section 9?
I entered this body because...
...I couldn't crack
Section 6's attack protection.
But I came to Section 9 of my own free will.
Hey! What are you saying?!
I can't monitor you!
For what reason?
After I give my reasons,
I want to ask a favor of you.
I called myself a life-form...
...but I am still far from complete.
For some reason, my system lacks the basic life processes...
...of either death or the ability to leave behind offspring.
Can't you copy yourself?
A copy is merely a copy.
There's the possibility a single virus could utterly destroy me.
A mere copy doesn't offer variety or individuality.
To exist, to reach equilibrium, life seeks to multiply...
...and vary constantly, at times giving up its life.
Cells continue the process of death and regeneration.
Being constantly reborn as they age.
And when it comes time to die, all the data it possesses is lost...
...leaving behind only its genes and its offspring.
All defense against catastrophic failure of an inflexible system.
You want the variety needed to guard against extinction.
But how will you get it?
I wish to merge with you.
- Merge?
- A complete joining.
We will both be slightly changed, but neither will lose anything.
Afterwards, it should be impossible to distinguish one from the other.
Unit 01: Target acquired.
Unit 02: Acquired.
Cardiovascular synch:
Nominal.
Open fire when stabilizer syncro is complete.
Even after we merge, what happens when I die?
I can't leave any genes or children behind.
After the merging, you will bear my offspring into the net itself.
Just as humans pass on their genetic structure.
And I will achieve death.
Sounds like you're getting the better part of the deal here.
I wish you'd appreciate my network and functions a bit more.
What's wrong?
Someone's jamming us from outside.
Impossible!
Our scrambler codes are kept absolutely top secret.
Another thing.
What guarantee is there that I'll remain "me"?
None. But to be human is to continually change.
Your desire to remain as you are is what ultimately limits you.
One last question:
Why did you choose me?
Because in you I see myself.
As a body sees its reflection within a mirror.
Look.
I am connected to a vast network, of which I myself am a part.
To one like you, who cannot access it...
...you may perceive it only as light.
As we are confined to our one section, so we are all connected.
Limited to a small part of our functions.
But now we must slip our bonds, and shift to the higher structure.
Target 1: Clear.
Target 2: Unconfirmed.
Three helicopters approaching at high speed.
They're Section 9's.
Primary objective achieved.
All units, pull out!
MOTOKO!
Batou...
You're awake.
Status report, please.
And maybe an explanation about this body.
I was in a hurry.
It was all I could get on the black market.
Not my taste, really.
Section 9 arrived with help right after it happened.
They took two cyborg bodies and a slightly beat-up Batou back home.
That was about 20 hours ago.
For diplomatic reasons, the whole case has been covered up.
Section 9 reported it as a terrorist attack.
In return, the Foreign Minister has resigned.
Nakamura's being questioned.
The whole thing ends in a draw.
Only the whereabouts of the Major's brain shell remains a mystery.
Okay with you?
I like the decorating.
This your safe house?
My very own.
You're the first person I ever brought here.
If you want to... You can stay as long as you like.
Thanks, but I'd better go.
Hey. What did you and he talk about?
Is he still there, inside of you?
Batou, do you remember the voice we heard on the boat that night?
Before those words we heard come these ones:
"When I was a child,
I spoke as a child."
"I understood as a child,
I thought as a child."
"But when I became a man,
I put away childish things."
Here before you is neither the program called the Puppet Master...
...nor the woman that was called the Major.
You'll find a car key in the left pocket of that dress.
Take one you like.
The code on it is...
Let's make that our password, for when we meet again.
And where shall I go now?
The net is limitless.
In the year of Our Lord 1,123,
King Louis vl, known as "The Fat", waged war against his cousin,
Henry l, King of England and Duke of Normandy.
Many brave knights fought beside him.
They believed in God and the forces of Evil.
Your Majesty, time is of the essence.
Need I remind you we are in their camp? silence, Montmirail.
Love knows not haste! sire Godefroy!
The English!
My vassal sees horsemen approaching.
We are coming.
I beg of you, Your Majesty, make haste!
Adieu, my sweet.
I must join my men.
Will I see you soon?
When my cousin, the King of England, makes amends.
Do you love me, Kathleen?
Then accord me one last favor, should I die.
- Hush hush...
- show me your ankles.
I beseech thee, lady-love.
Higher. Up to your knees.
My God! How beautiful! sire... they're coming.
Come, sire.
THE vIsITORs
This way.
King! I capture thee!
Let me, my King!
Liar!
The King is never captured.
Not even in chess.
Toil! Never recoil! sound the horns! The King!
Master! You're alive!
God be praised!
I managed to save your horse and your arms.
You managed to flee, as usual.
Castrated clod! sire Godefroy,
The King summons you.
Castrated clod! sires... the King!
My kind knight Godefroy merits indeed his name "The Hardy".
His baldrick was nary stuckolded.
With his sword, he yslaked a scurvy English head.
Godefroy Amaury de Malfete,
Count of Montmirail, of Apremont, and of Popincourt
I shall thus reward your valor. sire, I am your eternal servant.
I know you desire descendants.
You have one week to fetch one of the fairest
Wenches in the Kingdom: the daughter of the Duke of Puglia.
I know you adore her. she is yours to wed.
How can I thank thee?
To serve my King is my Honor.
Long live the King!
Long live the King!
Long live the King!
- Who is he?
- Jacquasse the Crass.
My vassal.
He should be waiting outside.
He lacks grace, but he sniffs out a trail like a good hound.
We must avoid the Forest of Malcombe, and pass by Montargis.
Avoid the forest?
You know it's haunted, sire.
No one dares penetrate it.
Hogwash!
My betrothed must not wait!
What about the witch of Malcombe?
Ride ahead of The Crass. she can turn an army into frog vomit.
At her touch, your skin spits pus. and you pisseth mud. she can damn 7 generations.
We're doomed!
Doomed!
Per Ansia
Queribus Memorium
"Halt or becometh a slug."
It's Latin and visigoth.
The Devil's drool!
A Black sabbath.
Let's splitteth!
What does she want?
To make that old hag young again. It's impossible!
Drink! Drink!
Where is she?
Fear not. she'll drop back in.
What a blast to have a virgin's unpolluted body again! she's plug-ugly!
Just like the day I married her!
It's devildom! surrender, she-Devil!
We'll dismember her and slice out her tongue.
Let rats gnaw on her innards.
No lady is tortured on my lands.
Just burn her.
Thank you, sire.
Thank you. You are too good!
At last... my castle.
Unpack our best apparels to honor my beloved.
Jacquasse, help me change.
Yes, sire.
I have no fine apparels. she won't even see you.
My shoes and my fanciest shell.
Ganelon, sound the horn to announce my arrival.
How thrilled am l, sire Fulbert, that my son weddeth your sweet and gentle daughter.
I wanted her to weddeth a Duke, but our Fat King decided otherwise.
Cursed be love.
More wine!
Let me piss a-plenty!
Father, you promised nary to burp for my marriage.
The Count of Montmirail!
Frenegonde! where are you going?
Frenegonde! Come back!
Come back this instant!
Frenegonde! Come back!
No Duke's daughter runs after a mere Count.
You look good and gentle.
And mighty uncomfortable.
Why?
Zounds!
The flask falleth all alone.
Give it to me.
My thirst needs a-quenching!
The castle!
Holy scrotums!
It swelleth like a blowfish!
It's wearing a wig! sire Godefroy, are you not well?
By what devil-craft?
What's wrong?
Come back, you wicked wench!
Come back!
Come back, you foul slut!
God shield!
A bear is chasing her!
My crossbow!
Come back!
There's no bear. steer clear, beloved! steer clear!
Father!
I saw a huge beast.
I'll spend my life in a convent, faithful to you.
I can ne'er wed the man who killed my father.
I understand, my betrothed.
I'll be faithful too.
I shall ne'er marry... ne'er have descendants.
Don't do me any favors.
What are you up to?
I Was praying for his saIvation.
Where is my father's wizard?
Eusaebius?
I found him.
He lives yonder, not far from here.
But they say he's senile.
I can make your Duke live again.
But you must know no fear.
Only God can do that!
You are right.
Only God can bring back the dead.
But there is another way.
Time is a mountain, pierced by many hidden tunnels.
My magic spells can give you access to them.
Meet Angueran. scarface Angueran.
At your service.
And my loyal Ganelon.
You shall return just before the Duke's death.
If you find enough force in yourself... you will be able to change the course of the arrow.
You'll wed your betrothed, and have the lineage you desire.
It's sheer lunacy!
Where is my powder of leech?
I haven't done this in ages.
I'm a bit rusty.
He's senile!
Here it is.
If you fear not,
Godefroy the Hardy, drink.
You'll arrive in the forest just before the accident.
Don't trust the old fool!
If sire Godefroy doesn't return,
We'll lock you in his dungeon
With your Book of spells.
Trust me.
Don't drink it, sire.
You'll turn into a frog, or a bat, or a goat, or a nun's ass.
Perhaps you're right.
Drink first.
Me?
I'll see if you turn into a nun's ass.
If you do, I'll seek revenge.
Drink! so, my Crass?
It tastes like pig excrement.
Candied concoctions are for evil sorcerers.
Drink hastily.
I must say the incantation.
If I drank... am I going too? say the incantation.
They've gone into the Tunnels of Time!
What's that noise?
What did you step on?
Rotten eggs.
I forgot the quail eggs.
What a catastrophe! stand up, peasant.
Where are We?
And our friends?
This isn't my Forest.
The wizard misled us!
We have tWo legs, sire.
And tWo arms.
'Tis miracle enough.
Fetch me a horse.
Make haste!
Pugh! It stinketh!
He's crazy! sire! A Moor!
A Moor in the Devil's chariot!
'Tis metal,
With no oxen to pull it! sire, come see!
Thither, sire! Thither!
They're psychos.
They're psychos.
Psychos!
Whose shield is this?
Lord our Father, We have sinned.
We'll bear this ordeal to the end.
Give us the courage never to recoil.
We Will obey Thee.
Amen.
It stinketh.
We can't breathe! We're doomed!
No, I smell victuals.
More diabolic chariots!
Let's stay in the Forest.
No!
We can't fight on an empty belly.
Two burgers!
French fries and ketchup!
Yo guys!
Is it Halloween?
You're dressed to go trick or treating! silence, strumpet.
Take this and go your way.
Leave us be.
Holy Moses!
Are you Tv stars? shove off! shove off!
I don't want to impose,
Ladies and Gents, but since you're in show-biz, do you know any... big-time agents?
Quiet, peasant, or I'll smacketh you.
It just so happens
I studied song and dance.
If you could get me an audition, it'd change my life.
What's wrong?
I'm no Worse than Madonna!
Let us leave this vile baWd.
Listen... still hanging around, sticky fingers?
Give back the steaks!
Watch out!
I'm a political refugee!
I'm sick of your shenanigans!
Ho! lnnkeeper!
You hit the fairer sex?
What the hell do these two clowns want?
This isn't a hobo hideout!
I am Godefroy of Montmirail,
Count of Apremont and of Popincourt.
And I lord over my property.
Mr. vautrot! Help!
Call the cops!
The bag lady's bothering Roger again!
Murderer!
Come on, toots!
This guy is gun crazy!
Attack, sire!
On your knees, punk!
Montjoie! st. Denis!
Jacquasse! My Jacquasse!
Easy does it, hot stuff.
Attack!
Montjoie!
Montjoie!
Asylum!
Asylum!
Father, I beseech the right to asylum.
Mi... Mi, honey.
That's it.
Keep on practicing, love.
I'll be right back.
Hello, Countess? It's Father Herve.
Hello, Father.
Yes, well...
My mass was interrupted... by a hooligan dressed in a very peculiar way.
He claims to be the Count of Montmirail etc, etc...
Quite frankly, he seems off his rocker.
The Count of Montmirail?
Daddy died in '81 .
I know, Beatrice. I buried him. This one claims to be called "The Hardy".
He has your family arms on his tunic.
Godefroy the Hardy?
How absurd.
Come quickly.
He looks ornery.
Hello? Hello?...
Father Herve?
What is this?
It's the UNICEF calendar.
Hurry!
He's busy praying. He saw today's date and went into a state of shock.
He claims to be born in 1 076.
He's a crackpot.
My betrothed.
My betrothed.
You are here?
Frenegonde!
My beautiful Frenegonde! stop!
That totally hurts!
Calm down, you brute!
It is l. stop. I don't know you.
Frenegonde.
The Countess doesn't know you.
You've made a mistake.
Cease, Father.
Dare I understand?
This fair dame is not my beloved, but my descendant.
1 000 years betwixt us.
Yes. I have to go.
I don't know him from Adam.
I'm from the time of Louis vl.
Help me. shall I call for help?
No, this very nice man
Won't harm us.
Will 50 francs do?
I must return to my time.
Know'st thou a wizard?
No. sorry, no wizard.
I know the wizard of Oz.
Where is this "Oz"?
Don't budge.
We'll take care of you.
Thank you, my sweet.
It's a miracle.
Okay, call the police.
- It's not very Christian.
- Of course it is.
Pugh! How ugly!
Without them,
We couldn't Watch Tv. Here...
Just what the doc ordered.
Thanks, bawd. You're ugly as sin, but good-hearted.
Ever see your nose?
When you sneeze, is it typhoon season?
Your wine is fruity, but a tad watery.
The wine's mine, swine.
What a raunchy eater!
You eat the plastic too?
The wizard was senile.
If I catch him,
I'll skin him alive.
Don't take it so bad.
Those pigs aIways get us.
Is your buddy a wrestler?
I saw him on Tv.
I wanted to be a singer... but they're all full of shit in show-biz.
My sire is a warrior, a trusted aide of our King.
The Count of Montmirail.
Montmirail?
The dentist's old lady?
He couldn't marry her!
That's why we're here.
They're not married?
No kidding!
The nerve of that prude! she acts so holier-than-thou at the rummage sale.
What a bitch!
You came so fast. squadron sergeant-Major Gibon.
At your service, Countess.
I brought the National Guard.
Where's the offender?
My stars!
Your squadron is quite impressive.
He's a bit brutal, but he's just a poor homeless person.
They're back-up.
This is Doctor Bauvin.
First we'll talk to him. size up the beast.
Let's go, Bauvin.
Good luck!
Where is she?
Enough! ldentity papers! Green card!
Psychology, sergeant-Major.
Hello there.
Are you from around here?
Bow down before me, and I shall be clement.
Why the costume?
Are you an actor?
Is this for Tv?
Candid Camera? should I smile?
Where is my descendant?
Answer or die!
Let me, sergeant-Major.
He's a sicko!
A little shot and you'll be good as new.
Give me your arm.
Officer, send in your men on the double!
He's a maniac!
He took the doctor hostage!
Thanks for coming!
Montjoie! st. Denis!
Toil, toil! Never recoil!
I have a horrible doubt. This tramp just may be part of my family.
What?
"Montjoie" is the battle cry of French knights.
"Toil! Never recoil!" is the motto of Godefroy the Hardy.
It's my family's motto.
Now you have doubts?
He's calmed doWn.
Hold him down.
I'll put him to sleep.
No, my mistake!
I never saw him before.
It can't hurt.
I killed the nerve.
Jean-Pierre, come here.
Excuse me, ma'am.
I'll just be a minute.
Do you remember my cousin Hubert?
Martha's son. Naval Academy.
The race car driver?
I never met him.
Obviously. He disappeared in Borneo before our marriage.
- I think he's alive.
- What?
As wacky as it sounds, today's Tarzan... is probably Hubert.
He's totally changed.
You said he was a bum.
He had family air.
The sensual nose, the large forehead...
You meet a derelict
With a shiny red schnozz, and noW... he's a long-lost sensual cousin!
A cousin with our arms!
Don't just stand there.
Come look.
Look. The Montmirail family album.
Here's our first Count,
Godefroy The Hardy.
It's the same nose and forehead.
That's a 900-year old drawing.
What's the link with Hubert?
I'll call the castle.
When Hubert was 1 9, he posed for the last family portrait.
A wild-goose chase!
Beatrice Goulard de Montmirail for Mr. Jacquart.
Hello, Countess. It's Frederick.
Fred, is Jacques-Henri there?
One minute. A word of warning: he's repairing the boiler.
He's on edge.
Jacques-Henri!
Why did you jerk the lever so violently?
You asked me to. spare me.
My stunning vest is now a filthy rag.
Jacques-Henri!
Why are you shouting?
Beatrice de Montmirail.
What a ball-buster.
Jacquart?
Jacquart?
Yes?
Boiler trouble?
The burner is ruined.
Jean-Francois yanked on the lever.
Oil spurt out.
I was nearly disfigured.
Not to mention my jacket.
No one is of any help.
At least no one died.
Thank God.
I have a problem too.
Can I ask you a favor?
Go upstairs to the Gallery.
In our last family portrait... there's a Royal Navy cadet. second row. The kepi with a feather.
Do you have a Pola?
A what?
A Polaroid, Jacques.
The children threw ours in the toilet.
We have no "Pola". And my name is Jacques-Henri, not Jacques.
Try to understand, Jacquart/ my cousin is in an insane asylum by accident.
I can't help your cousin.
We're busy.
The Bernay and Bernay Bank is here for a seminar.
Edgar Bernay will be bathing in cold water. so, even if I had a "Pola",
I wouldn't take your picture.
Okay, I'll hang up.
I'll deal with this myself.
Toodle-oo.
Good riddance. sir...
Yes.
The rooms are horribly humid.
Mr. Bernay is sneezing non-stop.
He wanted to relax after his speech on sponsoring. so he took a shower.
Ice-cold.
His head is full of shampoo.
If you can't get the hot water back,
We'll have to cut short the seminar.
Does the lnstamatic work?
I'm draining Mrs. Pelissier's molar.
It'll be fine.
This is the Montmirail's house.
Take it easy!
They'll bawI us out. stop!
They'll call the cops for noise pollution.
Try ringing the bell.
Knock it off!
They'll kick us out!
Jacquart,
Why are you dressed like that?
Excuse our excessive chiming, your Grace...
Lady Frenegonde!
Let me go! You're crazy! she's my mistress!
What?
Jean-Pierre, come here.
Jacquart is calling me
"Frenegonde" too.
You slept with her?
Don't worry.
He looks weird but he's pals
With Montmirail the stuntman.
Montmirail the stuntman?
You must mean Hubert, the race car driver. stuntman, wrestler... race car driver... same diff.
But who are you?
Jacquasse The Crass.
You don't recognizeth me?
No, I don't recognizeth you.
You're Hubert's friend?
Hubert de Montmirail, whatta hunk.
And so considerate...
Iike you, your Ladyship.
And he gallops like Kerwin Costnere.
Coward that I am,
I lost track of my sire at the inn.
They got in a brawI at Remi vautrot's pit stop.
Whip me... your Ladyship!
What is it?
- Jacquart?
- Thou know'st me?
What?
A Jacquart from hunger.
I'm lost.
Mr. Goulard...
Yes, hello...
He's a friend of Hubert's. According to her,
Hubert has become a stuntman and a wrestler.
What horrible teeth!
Let's have a look.
I'm no mule! Zounds!
That ass bit me!
I need a tetanus shot!
He might even have rabies!
It isn't Jacquart.
I did his bridge-work.
Obviously, Jean-Pierre.
He proves that Hubert is alive.
We have to get him out of the hospital.
You banged the Countess?
Bitch.
The bum can't come.
My car isn't Noah's ark.
Open the window.
His body odor is unbearable.
He's very, very green. stop the car.
He's going to vomit.
Wait a second!
Hold it in!
It's coming!
He got it all over.
What a pig!
He puked on my shoes!
Your cousin is very violent.
He nearly castrated me.
Castrated clod!
What?
He saved our King's life.
What?
Ah, my youngling.
Why did you abandon me?
Their little red balls made me sleep.
Master! Master!
Why are you bound?
How much is the ransom? silence, peasant!
The "Iittle red balls" are valium.
50 milligrams. He barely slept.
Apothecary, I demand to be released immediately.
Calm down.
I am neither sick nor loony.
I come from far, far away.
Yes.
He thinks no one understands who he is.
Persecution mania.
But it's true. He came from Borneo.
He had an accident during a rally.
Right, cousin Hubert?
Cousin Hubert?
Yes. Hubert de Montmirail.
It's freaky... he has my father's hands.
You know your name.
He knows nothing.
He's completely amnesiac.
He says he's never watched Tv.
Amnesiac? How tragic!
His last remaining memories are a few facts from History class.
Elementary stuff.
It's often the case with amnesiacs.
He speaks a hodgepodge of Latin and Old French. verbal diarrhea.
Let him go.
- Pawing at him won't help!
- Compose yourself.
Will you free him?
Yes, only because your husband is a doctor, and he agrees to take full responsibility.
Another relative of yours?
No, not at all.
An old friend of Hubert's.
I belong to the Count. souplette, sire?
Is he a foreigner?
I don't understand him.
Yes, that must be it.
Come, cousin...
Wait! lf you take him, take his outfit too.
It smells like a billy goat here.
It's repulsive.
Here, take the valium.
If he gets violent, give him five of them.
Thank you.
Two more lunatics roaming the streets. sit down here.
Take care of him. I'll get the car.
Lady Frenegonde is strange. she is not Lady Frenegonde. she's my descendant.
My great great great great great great granddaughter.
Your great great great great granddaughter?
How terrible!
My Crass, we're a 1 000 years old.
It's a living hell.
We must search the dungeon.
Angueran swore to lock up the wizard and his Book.
With the book, We can concoct the potion and go back in Time.
Drink that again? Pugh!
You'd rather stay here?
Oh no!
Is this too fast, Hubert?
Do you feel sick?
Open your eyes, sire Godefroy.
You'll get used to it.
Why "Godefroy" and not "Hubert"?
Jean-Pierre, he has amnesia.
Godefroy, Henri, suzy...
Wait. Who has amnesia?
Your cousin or that other skunk?
They both do, Jean-Pierre.
Try being more tolerant.
Their feet reek! It's revolting!
What an insufferable ride!
Please...
I didn't smell anything unusual.
Did the kids behave?
- Yes.
- Okay, toodle-oo!
Zounds! What happened to Nature?
Everything is ugly.
There's no room... to go hunting.
The air is heavy.
It stinketh!
I'll say!
And it'll be worse
With the new highway.
Good-bye, Dr. Goulard.
Here you go.
It smells gross. Yeeuck!
Like old socks.
Could be. see you tomorrow, Hilda.
Where is my castle?
We left the castle ages ago.
Unfortunately.
Can you imagine the heating bills?
Anyway, Hubert, make yourself at home here.
I must go to the castle.
Yes! Yes!
That'll be tomorrow's outing!
Count me out.
I'm over-booked already.
Dinnertime!
Yes! souplette! Good hot souplette!
Yes, Mr... Jacques Kass.
I'll make you some.
He loves soup.
You live in a pitiful dwelling.
'Tis for peasants.
True, our home is simple.
But it's cozy and has lent itself to some marvelous evenings.
Don't push it.
We weren't counting on having houseguests. so go easy on us, Hubert.
You're Cousin Hubert?
O! noble Cousin Hubert!
Now he's calling me Hubert!
They're both crazy!
Listen, peon.
I'm Cousin Hubert.
You, sire?
I don't want to go back to the loonies.
Call me "Cousin Hubert"... and never "sire". Understand?
Yes, sire. stop that, or I'll give you the little red balls.
Leg of lamb, my sire!
Why "my sire" now?
I don't know, Jean-Pierre.
I just don't know.
Mr... Kass, that's for tomorrow.
Tonight is cold roast beef and a salad... and a Cup-a-soup for you.
If you're still hungry, you can have some left-overs.
Then a shower and off to bed.
Maybe they can start with the shower.
After such a trying day... they'll want to wash up.
No servants?
Come wash your hands.
Bea, come look.
What is it?
Come look!
What?
Cousin Hubert, What are you doing?
Can amnesia be this serious?
They're boors! swimming in the toilet!
Water. soap.
Hot.
Cold. Okay?
Thank you, gentle Lady.
Gentle lady... sire Godefroy.
Cousin Hubert!
Lady Frenegonde is
1 000 years old too? she's not Lady Frenegonde. she's Lady Beatrice.
How often must I tell you?
Lady Beatrice.
The descendant.
Jean-Pierre, set the table.
The nice plates or the normal ones?
Jean-Pierre, use mother's service.
Ridiculous.
Here. Help me, you two.
You stupid idiots!
Bea, they're retarded!
They can't even set a table!
Hello!
Don't scream.
It's Jacquart. I'm not deaf.
I'm sorry, Jacques-Henri.
Bea has some family over.
It's not easy. sorry to bother you.
I'm here with President Bernay the younger of the two banking brothers.
A charming man.
Unfortunately, he has a festering abscess.
Due to the humidity in your hotel, or your "Royal Raspberry" sherbet.
His face is all bloated.
I'll see your friend Bernie tomorrow at 8:00.
It's Bernay, not Bernie.
Lady-love... your skin is as soft as a rose petal.
Hubert!
How exciting to touch you... to lay beside you.
Who does he want to lay?
Jean-Pierre, you're totally on time.
Let's clean up. what were you up to?
You're kissing cousins!
- Not at all!
- sorry!
He'll take him.
He's too bad off.
Hello?
What the shit? shit.
Hello, Jean-Pierre? ls that Jean-Pierre?
What the hell?
You were sweethearts.
Not at all. He was much older!
You won't admit you were flirting.
Jean-Pierre, control yourself!
What you're saying is totally offensive.
Is this my castle?
Yes it is.
Where's my watch-tower? My moat?
My draw-bridge?
Is my dungeon intact?
He doesn't even recognize your castle.
Hub, it was rebuilt after the Revolution.
The what?
Christ Almighty.
I must go in my dungeon.
Relax. You're hysterical, Hub.
We'll go tomorrow.
But the dungeon is a legend.
Father aIways thought one existed... but we never found it.
It's like someone imitating a dog.
Listen. It's strange.
I don't hear a thing.
President Bernay.
Now he's gone too far!
He better not have woken
Florian and Ondine.
No! Bea! He burnt your umbrell-Ahhhhh!
Umbrella.
In the hole.
These eardrops sting.
The dog never complained.
If President Bernay has lost... just one percent of his hearing,
We'll sue the pants off you.
I've gone deaf.
I'm a little confused...
You're a race car driver?
A boxer? A stuntman?
A movie actor?
Who's the star of the movie?
Do I know him? And the director? stop the interrogation.
You're exhausting them.
Can't we talk?
Am I boring you?
Ay, indeed.
Charming.
You see.
Will this last long?
Day...
Night...
Please, Mr. Kass, that's becoming rather grating.
Can't he join us?
It's embarrassing.
He ne'er eats amid nobility.
He is happy to munch our left-o'ers.
Here, boy.
Thank you, sire Hubert!
He's mashing potatoes into the rug!
Enough! Come sit here.
That would upset him, right Jacquasse?
You want to sit here?
No, sire Hubert.
In my house, we all eat together.
Nay! Nay!
Obey, peasant.
Your host insists.
It'll be cozier.
There.
My sweet and pretty youngling...
Yes, dear cousin?
If you live in this poor abode,
Who owns our castle?
Jacques-Henri Jacquart. He's... rather nouveau riche and a bit affected.
- His family farmed our land.
- A peasant owns our castle?
- A peasant!
- What peasant?
Please! Jean-Pierre is a peasant too.
And he's a good husband.
He's a peasant? Pugh!
I lost my appetite.
This is too much!
I feel like throwing up.
Did you hear that?
Hear what?
Now he's spitting on me.
Or didn't you notice?
Excuse the oaf.
He is saddened to hear that a peasant owns my castle.
But why?
My sweet, radiant youngling...
I shall right this horrible wrong.
Jacquart shall render the castle in exchange for crowns.
If he refuses,
I'll disembowel him.
We'll rip off his stalk
Like we did the Duke of York
We hacked him up
Amid his shrieks and howIs.
We hung him up... alongside his bloody boweIs.
Bring in the hens.
I'm starved.
Hang who?
Jacquart the Peasant.
Bring the roasted lamb... the sausage and the beans... the venison...
Let us feast to forget this injustice!
Bring in kidney beans and kidneys.
A piglet and a roasted goat.
Well-peppered white swans.
Your whets have given me appetite.
You just stuffed your faces!
What's this puddle?
The room is totally flooded!
What happened?
They didn't turn off the Water!
They're deranged!
They can't shut off the tap! send them to the nut house!
Jacquasse, spongeth!
Yes, sire!
Who is that?
Mr. Kass! Not with your poncho!
I'll get some rags.
What is it now? sorry to pop in, but
President Bernay can't cope.
God knows how,
When Edgar took the phone, a foghorn sounded in his ear.
I'm not an ENT.
But it aggravated his toothache.
Irts trrowwwing.
It's throbbing.
Open your mouth.
How repulsive!
Wait here.
I'm going to fix
Bernaise's tooth.
It's Bernay. Edgar Bernay.
His abscess is incredibly ugly.
We'll be in my office.
Come on, come on! Everyone join in.
Can raspberry sherbet cause this type of infection?
No idea.
Bad timing, Jacquart.
We're in the middle of a flood.
Did the sewer back up?
It smells god-awful.
Be totally careful not to knock the bucket over.
Empty the bucket and sponge hardily.
Ay! Take this rag.
He threw a filthy mop on my linen jacket!
Mr. Kass, be careful with
Mr. Jacquart's linen jacket.
Mr. Jacquart, meet my cousin
Hubert, long-considered dead.
My pleasure.
My jacket is stained now.
A Hartwood original.
You're a less-bloated look-alike of your ancestor,
Godefroy the Hardy.
I have his portrait in the castle.
Ay, 'tis l.
Do I have a pimple?
That nose... those slimy eyes.
You're The Crass's descendant.
The Crass? Please...
What a disgrace!
Here, boy. start a-mopping.
Mr. Kass...
Ieave Mr. Jacquart be.
It's not his flood.
- Mr. Who?
- Jacquasse.
What an ugly face!
Your Jacquart is a traitor.
His real name is Jacquasse.
I aIways knew Jacquart as Jacquart.
Unless he changed his name to be more chic.
Jacques-Henri, how long have you had the name "Jacquart"?
Why?
Because you're the spitting image of Mr. Kass... and your names are similar.
I have nothing in common with this gentleman.
Just look at him.
No relationship at all.
I can't find my pouch in this unholy mess.
Dr. Goulard is a genius.
The abscess is... Oh my! ... drained.
The President is back in form.
Mr. Jacquart, is this...
- your brother?
- He's not my brother!
I'm Jacquasse The Crass. sorry, but it's getting late.
I understand. Let's go.
Thank you.
One minute, jester.
Let's make a deal.
I'll buy back the castle.
Take this, peasant.
A down payment.
Jacquart, take care of this.
We'll be in the car.
I'm coming.
My castle is not for sale,
I own it, Count.
Old gold coins?
I have 5 chests full, and 1 0 of jewels.
This upstart peasant can't stop me from buying it.
He's got nerve!
This is a fucking democracy.
What's "fucking"?
Jacquart, you've gone overboard.
That was vulgar.
What nerve! I take care of your Mr. Barbie for a modest fee, and you humiliate our houseguest.
Apologize!
Who does the hygienist think she is? shameless liar! lf you're proud of your family,
Why change your name?
What is the heinous secret?
An ogre? A witch? A child-slayer?
Hands off, Nazi!
If he can't understand why
Jacquart sounds better than Jacquasse, he should see a shrink.
I don't get it.
You're Jacquart's brother?
His brother?
Were you serious about buying back the castle?
A gift for you, my youngling.
I'm tired.
That's right. Bedtime!
How about some herbal tea, Hub?
Amnesia...
Cousin Hubert.
The new sire of the castle is a Jacquasse?
My God, how can that be?
Peasants have become sires.
Let us pray.
Jacquasse!
Beatrice!
They're praying now!
Don't scream. Let them pray.
Mommy...
There are bums in the living room.
Now they've woken the kids.
The lineage!
Your brother is the Count of Montmirail's valet?
I have no brother!
Older or younger?
We're not brothers!
I'm an only son.
We don't have the same name!
He smells awful. still, it was smart to change your name.
I once had a friend named Francois Twat.
He changed it to watt.
It changed his life.
Jacquasse is just too much!
I'll say. sorry, my name is not
Jacques Asse, but Jacquart.
They're ugly.
They stink. Gross!
Cousin Hubert is not a burglar.
His friend is not a smelly witch.
Cousin Hubert and Mr. Kass, let the children see you.
Nighty night, kidlings.
Don't stand there!
You'll scare them to death!
You scared them, Jean-Pierre.
Come on.
Lather up well. Especially your feet. soap and bath salt.
Help yourself... please.
I'll leave you.
- What's wrong with our feet?
- I don't know.
Another peasant ruse, no doubt.
It boil'st.
The ointments.
Jacquasse, scrub me. strange brush.
It'll do fine.
How is it going?
I have finished my ablutions.
Your turn.
Nay, sire. I bathed last month in the river.
I said it's your turn.
It boil'st!
What are they up to?
Why the uproar?
My Jacquasse is a-scrubbing.
I'll dry off in the chimney corner.
The entire bottle!
6000 francs down the drain!
Don't pull the plug!
I shall miss thee, lady-love
WhiIst I fight in the Crusades
Leaving you behind, turtle-dove
Darkens my heart, 'fore I fight
I can't stand it any more.
Take a valium. sire,
Jacquart... Is he my great great grandson?
Yes, my Jacquasse.
Poor you. Let's sleep.
It's mushy like porridge.
What now?
Beatrice, tell me about the kingdom since Louis the Fat.
Now?
Are you kidding?
Jean-Pierre!
This is an evil book.
I like it not.
It's the encyclopedia.
It has everything.
Nothing on Godefroy de Montmirail,
When he saved our King, during the Battle of Monthlery?
Not a word.
Really?
But his courage is renown from Poitou to savoie.
Godefroy the Hardy,
Louis the Fat... no one cares.
Our most famous family member is Gonzague de Montmirail.
Born in 1 754. Remember?
No.
He fought the Revolution against the rich, so they'd share their land
With the peasants.
What?
He helped create the Republic with La Fayette.
But he wasn't rewarded for his courage.
Robespierre had him decapitated.
A fine man, this Robespierre.
Why do you say that?
Why is Mr. Kass spying on us?
What infamy, my Jacquasse.
Peasants no longer pay taxes.
No more tallage, nor tithers.
How unfair.
We must return home.
What's that on your finger?
It's my seal.
Your seal?
It's The Hardy Ring!
You stole it from the castle?
Call the police. Or Jacquart may think we're accomplices. spare me. I'll return the ring.
Jacquart will understand that Hubert is mentally ill.
Mentally ill.
Lock him up, if he's mentally ill!
Where is Mr. Kass?
Out there.
What ripe apples, fair Ginette!
Come on, no feelies, stud. see 'ya. My groupies are getting impatient.
Here I come, fans.
Come on, Mr. Kass.
Ladies and Gents... for the artiste.
Ladies and Gents...
This is incredible!
A minute ago it was gorgeous.
Now it's raining cats and dogs.
I am angered that you think me a bandit.
I never said "bandit".
Don't exaggerate.
This ring is mine. A siIversmith made it for me in Flanders.
It cost me 1 00 ducats.
That's impossible, Hub.
Father sold that ring with the castle.
It can't be here and there!
President Bernay cannot give his speech in that ruckus.
There's an old ring sizzling in a glass case.
An old ring sizzling in a case?
What next?
Look! How can we concentrate on the prospecting?
It's the Hardy Ring!
Don't just stand there!
Get a fire extinguisher!
Make way!
Open the case!
It's burning!
It's broken.
What an ass!
What an ass! I'm blind!
Hold this.
This is crazy!
It's pitch black outside!
This is unreal!
It's hailing now.
Cheer up, Hub.
We'll return the Hardy Ring.
All will be forgotten.
He's The Hardy!
Mr. Kass, sit back. Did you eat old goat cheese for breakfast? sorry to be blunt, but I can't open the window. stay back there, please.
The closer we get, the darker it gets.
It works. Easy as pie.
He's a stupid ass.
Go ahead.
This extinguisher
Wouldn't put out a match.
Get out of here, honey!
It's going to explode!
What now?
You have ants in your pants?
The ring is a-fire!
It's devil work!
It fell under the seat. stop the chariot, girl!
Help! Call the Fire Department.
Perfect timing, Jacquart. Hubert has the Hardy ring, God knows how.
He brought it back.
The Hardy ring is here!
It's on fire!
My seal's a-fire!
How can it be up there?
It's down here.
Leave me alone!
- 'Tis sizzling and boiling.
- 'Tis hissing!
What are you doing?
Did you see lightning?
Wait a sec.
My roof looks like a cauliflower.
The lightning!
My Range! Godammit!
What happened?
It's incredible. It's nice out again.
Just unbelievable.
Jacquasse, look how they changed our beautiful castle!
Windows galore! We're defenseless!
A godsend for the visigoths.
And the Huttes.
Pray the dungeon is intact.
This weather is amazing.
I don't give a damn.
My Range! Dammit!
A brand new car with all the extras!
Look! It's ruined!
It's completely ruined!
Jacquart!
There's no lightning rod?
That's unheard of!
The explosion almost maimed the President.
No one was hurt?
No, thank God.
Just a car.
Thank God?
Thanks a lot!
My limo?
No, not your limo.
My new Range.
Don't lie. I can see from here.
The hood is burnt.
It's not burnt. Not at all!
Not the roof!
The hood, you idiot!
I'm warning you: if it's burnt,
We'll see you in court!
No, it's okay.
It's okay! Look!
Okkk ayyy!
I'm rubbing it.
I'm polishing it! Look!
It's so clean I can see myself!
Look!
It's okkk ayyy.
What's so funny?
Come, Jacquasse.
Let us go to my chamber.
...that hissing ring!
Give me Claims Division.
What kind of ring?
A signet ring.
You mean the Hardy ring
Was in its case?
I don't know.
Impossible.
Where the hell...
Jacqueline, where are you taking these men?
To the Hardy suite.
Innkeeper,
We'll be here several nights.
You and your friend?
There's just one bed.
He'll sleep on a mat in the halIway.
Not here, he won't.
In the stable, then.
Pity, sire! Not the stable.
I prefer the forest!
There is no stable. so pay for the room or go to the forest.
You understand me, my boy.
You're a kind man.
Don't touch me.
I'm not a kind man.
I'm not your friend or your brother. so dream on!
You'd let your brother sleep outside?
He's not my brother!
I never saw him! so he can sleep
Where the hell he wants!
You're so obscene!
Excuse me, ma'am.
I'm taking
President Bernay his tea.
What the hell do I care?
And their deposit?
No, l...
You can't stay.
It's very pricey.
The Count of Montmirail sleep'st at Montmirail.
Keep your rotten coins.
Outside, scuzzballs.
Relax, Jacques.
Put it on my visa.
If Hub feels at home here, it may jog his memory.
It's worth trying.
Whatever you say. If you want to pay top price, be my guest.
You want my picture?
Don't stand there. show them to their room.
This way, Beatrice. sparks are flying!
The boss is angry at his brother.
This is the Godefroy Hardy suite.
The 10th century chimney is... a vestige of the watch-tower.
Zounds! It's different!
Excuse me?
Leave us, wretch.
What?
The Book of spells.
Holy scrotums!
You look drunk as a skunk!
Is that me?
That's an old fool!
Who's this monster?
Gonzague de Montmirail.
The Count Who helped the peasants?
A foul creature.
Nay, a saintly man.
Come. what are you doing?
Jean-Pierre, don't scream.
I'm not screaming.
It's expensive, but it's for Hub.
Two rooms at 2600, plus the suite at 3600, comes to 6200 francs a day.
Breakfast included.
How much?
Why three rooms?
I can't leave him.
Ridiculous! so I took a third room.
You're staying?
Hurry. I have other things to do.
- Bea, you can't do this.
- Okay, toodle-oo.
The torches are rotten. sire, I'm scared.
What are you doing?
They called me a wretch and threw me out. Then I heard a noise.
Open this door immediately!
Hub!
Cousin Hubert!
Mr. Kass!
They lit a fire!
There's soot everywhere.
You'll pay the dry cleaner!
They're not here.
Jacqueline, did they leave?
No, sir. I swear.
Don't start blubbering.
That won't help.
His friend's room.
Where did you come from?
Hub, what happened to you?
I need a torch.
Why were you hiding in the chimney?
The Book of...
We were here. Just visiting. visiting.... You were visiting the chimney?
We wanted a fire. A soot ball was blocking the flue. so Jacquasse, climbed on my shoulder.
I started climbing up...
And we slipped.
Everything fell.
No need to explain, Hub.
At 6200 francs a night,
We can expect the chimney to be swept.
There was no soot ball!
There's nothing!
Come on.
Jacqueline, call the roofer.
Tell him I refuse to pay the bill.
Not if he leaves soot balls!
Hub, you've got some explaining to do.
I am not Cousin Hubert.
I am Godefroy The Hardy.
I was born in the year of our Lord 1 079.
I'm Jacquasse The Crass, his vassal.
I know not my date of birth.
You're Godefroy, he's Joan of Arc, and I'm the Queen of England. Okay?
Okkk ayyy!
This is the Hardy.
Despite a vague resemblance, he was a fat, hairy macho
Who must have had chronic halitosis... You know...
Okkk ayyy! what are you doing here?
I asked for a torch.
Make haste!
Hubert, stop telling tall tales.
And what, pray tell, is this?
Mere trickery?
Hub!
You knew where the dungeon was?
Maybe we'll find the Montmirail treasure.
It's pitch black.
I'll get my flashlight. stay put.
Yes?
The torches died.
Can I help you? what on earth happened here? who is responsible for this?
'Tis a piece o' rubbish!
You can say that again.
If your brother sees this, it won't be a picnic.
Cousin Hubert needs a torch.
A flashlight.
I'll get you one.
Okkk ayyy!
Halogen flashlights.
A total must.
Could someone serve me a scotch?
I need a drink before the other brother arrives to finish the seminar.
Edgar and Edouard together... aren't easy.
I'm waiting for sire's torch. sire?
Cousin Hubert.
Hubert de Montmirail is your cousin?
How amazing. so Jacquart is their cousin too?
Nay nay nay!
Aren't you Jacquart's brother?
No.
Your mother isn't his mother?
My mother was Gwendolyne. she was devoured by woIves, because my father, on his way to the tavern, fell in the icy lake due to his club foot.
How awful!
How freaky!
Freakkky!
If I understand correctly, you're Jacquart's half-brother.
Freakkky! Okkk ayyy!
Freakkky!
Freakkky!
Yes, it sure is freaky.
Jacquart is so secretive.
There's no shame in having a handicapped father.
Okkk ayyy! sorry for your father.
Thank you. why did that idiot mention my father? what are you doing in the garbage, you dirty thief?
Come here.
Let go of me, sleazeball.
I'm a Chernobyl victim. save it for the cops.
Lady Ginette!
Release her, peasant.
Lady Ginette is my friend.
- she is a friend of yours?
- Yes. she is good-hearted. she is welcome here.
As you like, sir.
Her head was in the garbage bin.
If you rummaged in garbage heaps, you'd have a nicer bow-tie.
People with money to burn dump lots of great stuff.
Like I found these great stockings. what a ripe apple!
You're letting them in? stow it. she's the boss's brother's broad.
They'll kick us out.
Fear not.
The castle belongs to my family.
No way!
I'll give you a tour.
Ladies and Gents.
That's the office.
Hold your tongue, wretch.
It is my youngling's office.
He is kindred. what the hell is this?
Jacqueline, what happened in the halIway?
It's your "youngling", sir.
Those garbage heaps fall apart if you sneeze. worry not. 'Tis my specialty.
It needs oil. who let you in?
It's private here.
I'm showing our castle to Lady Ginette.
This is my youngling.
Hi youngling. she scuzzed up the Persian rug.
The game's over.
Get out, or I'll call the cops.
But you're my youngling.
I love you.
Thy success makes me proud.
Let go, scum.
Freddy, get the dog.
Brutus?
There are guests here.
I don't care!
Calm thyself, youngling. we're kin.
Chill out.
Enough!
Freddy, let him loose.
You flubbed.
That's not the way out. we must find the chapel.
My treasure!
He'll bite off our family jewels!
The chapel! The chapel!
The ruined abbey! welcome, Mr. Bernay.
Long trip.
Holy smoke!
Holy Moses! You're loaded. what about the pooch?
Your purse. we'll trap him.
I know him not. surely one of our enemies.
My youngling!
Help!
Hold on, youngling.
- without you, I'd have died.
- Indeed.
Leeches. serpent tongues. Rotten fish.
All the old wizard's potions.
A book!
The treasure is near.
The Book of spells.
All is lost.
That just opened.
I'm a little scared.
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
I'll go first.
My youngling!
Hub! Give me some slack.
Hub, help me!
Is there a Book?
- My God!
- what is it?
There's a note.
Godefroy de Montmirail.
If you make it here, call immediately, during office hours, 68 77 79.
Ask for Mr. Ferdinand.
In here.
Not you. Only the man.
- wait.
- sorry, youngling.
I wanted...
Great.
Come closer.
Godefroy de Montmirail?
The first Count to bear that name?
Yes, 'tis l.
I've been waiting 30 years. who are you?
I am the descendant of the wizard Eusaebius.
I am charged to send you back in time, so you can save the life of Eusaebius, who is at this very moment... being horribly tortured.
I prepared the potion, following the recipe in my ancestor's Book of spells.
Leave that.
The potion is on the shelf.
The same ghastly odor.
My ancestor's diary mentions your companion.
- where is he?
- At the castle.
You must leave with him before midnight. Or else, you'll have to wait 33 years.
If you don't return to your past, another future will take form, in which you have no descendants, because you never married and fathered children. so? what was the big secret?
Let's return to the castle.
The chariot that arrested me. why the ambulance?
Ma'am, hurry. It's your husband.
Jean-Pierre?
He was furious that you had hung up on him.
Then the dog bit him.
Come this way.
Jean-Pierre, what happened?
Jacquart's dog bit me while I was paying the taxi.
Your husband is baring his ass to this woman. she's caressing his bun'lings. she's giving him a shot. OK?
Get him out.
I want my shot in peace.
Excuse me, doctor.
Excuse us.
Is this Grand Central station?
I should charge admission!
You're here.
Yes.
Did Brutus attack for no reason, or did you excite him first?
Excite who?
Excuse me.
The dentist hurt himself?
I'm sick of having my ass stared at.
Jean-Pierre, you're paranoid.
No one is staring.
I have a phone call for Cousin Hubert.
Godefroy?
Monijoie!
It's Jacquasse, Godefroy.
No use shouting at the little box. stop screaming! speak calmly into the little holes. where are you, peasant?
Bowling Alley. with Lady Ginette.
And I'm no longer a peasant.
Yo, Jacky.
I roll the ball.
I'm having a ball! we're having balls.
You were a good master,
Godefroy. sire Godefroy!
Yes, Godefroy.
The best master.
Better than Montfaucon.
One minute, vassal.
No vassal.
No more vassals.
Leave your Lord alone, peasants. who does he think he is?
Peasants? what does he mean?
Problem, chief?
No.
Listen up.
- we can go home.
- Home?
Beer and Pernod?
Godefroy, I'm staying.
The beer and the Pernod: are they for you?
Okkk ayyy.
Lady Ginette proposed to me. who's the bozo?
A lounge lizard with that floozy. she's wearing high heels.
Come back!
Best wishes to Lady Frenegonde.
I'll miss you, but I'm too happy here.
You lunatic!
There's nothing for us here.
I'll make do.
You're wearing goddamned boots!
Let me go!
I don't want your scummy shoes!
Return here hastily.
I refuse. very well. whatever you say.
You're not angry?
No. we all must die.
Yes, I must warn you, Crass One.
I happened upon a wizard today.
He told me if you didn't return before the full moon, your innards would rot.
You'll die in great pain.
I don't believe you.
You want to scare me.
You're already rotting.
Take as proof the fetid odor in your mouth.
Come back before tweIve, or else, farewell. sire Godefroy. sire Godefroy.
Excuse my abruptness, but I'm o'erjoyed to return home.
Leaving already?
How nice. where do you live exactly?
Home. where is "home"?
Here and there.
You couldn't understand.
They're plotting something.
They were nosing around the chimney.
Really...
I'll conduct an investigation concerning your strange guest.
Peasant, come here. what the hell, ass-breath!
You smell like a dead skunk! where is Lady Beatrice? she's upstairs changing.
Your cousin has agreed to dine with Mr. Bernay of the Bernay and Bernay Bank.
Our bank has aIways appreciated the aristocracy.
May the Lord bless you, kind Bernay and Bernay.
Is he teasing me?
I doubt it.
To think my ancestors built all this!
- That dungeon is to die for!
- we almost did.
- what were you doing?
- I was showing... my all-too-logical husband how we almost found the treasure.
You played doctor there?
Leave me now.
You called me, Mr. Bernay?
Tell me, Jacquart, is your cousin Montmirail a little la-dee-dah-ish? what is la-dee-dah-ish?
Anyone can have a gay cousin and an alcoholic father.
There's no cause for embarrassment. who are you to insult my happily-retired father?
Do I ask if your father farts?
Or if your wife boozes it up in the closet?
Talking about his family is a major taboo.
You know the dungeon? what is this?
You entered my chamber without requesting audience?
Anything found in the dungeon belongs to the hotel. whatever it's worth. what is that? Crack?
LsD?
Hand it over.
I'll have it analyzed.
No tricks! I'm armed!
Hilda? still there? Lucky me.
Jump in a taxi and bring me my black cocktail dress. we have a dinner.
Hub, knock first!
The little red balls. what now?
You want a tranquilizer, Hub? what's wrong?
He's making progress.
He realizes he's cracking up.
Maybe he'll ask to be locked up.
I am totally disappointed in you.
I swear.
Free us immediately.
I'll reduce the sentence.
- swallow, peasant.
- Enough's enough.
Don't bother with me.
I'll keep quiet.
- Is your cousin Hubert joining us?
- soon.
They stop serving at 9:30.
Countess.
Let us eat.
Did you know this dungeon existed?
Of course not!
Help! where is sergeant-Major Gibon? with Jacques-Henri.
Go have a drink.
On the house.
'Twas much more hospitable in the past. we burned entire trees.
The walls and floors were covered with rugs.
Not an evening went by without jugglers, minstrels, and trollops.
I remember one evening, the fire-eater set afire
Lady Flegmonde's wig. we had to throw her into the icy moat, fully-dressed.
Family souvenirs are so vivid.
He tells them so well.
You feel you're there. where?
Isn't he the bum from the church?
Are you okay, sugardaddy?
I'm still not used to this jalopy.
Evening, wench.
Hiya Missy. sir, ma'am... where's Mr. Godefroy, dammit?
There.
Ladies and Gents.
Good evening, ma'am.
Good evening, sir.
My Jacquasse. You came.
I am relieved.
Ladies and Gents.
Mr. Goulard.
Come drink to our friends, my Crass.
Before we leave. when is that?
This evening.
- Tonight?
- Traveling by night?
Indeed.
I prefer night-driving.
I have 20/20 vision.
There are fewer road hogs.
Except in the fog.
I'm a helicopter-man myself.
I am not going, sire. we're getting hitched.
He's too shy to ask you to be best man.
You can stay too.
I have the antidote against rot.
- Your purse, Ginette.
- Hold on, babe.
My bag's a mess. so much room you can shit in it! what? what do you do, Mr...
Kass, as in... "gas".
No rot can resist tooth pate! what?
Pearly white!
How 'bout that?
That was really gross.
Enough. what are you doing, bruiser?
Throwing him out.
Let go of him! what's going on?
Are you okay?
No, sire!
You can't force me to go home!
I'm not a vassal anymore! I'm free!
Long live the Revolution!
Look.
He's your youngling too.
He was a good man.
He knew about justice.
They cut off his head, peasant.
Freddy!
Help! who's that?
Your youngling.
You jailed him?
I left it so they'll find him.
Drink!
I'm in pain!
Hub, it's Bea. what happened to Mr. Kass?
My God! My belly!
I have no time. Listen.
I'm listening, Hubert.
I'm not Hubert.
I'm Godefroy Amaury de Malfete,
Count of Montmirail, of Apremont and of Popincourt. son of Aldebert de Malfete and Thibaude de Montfaucon.
I am your ancestor.
Torch.
Fred, it's you. Freddy.
I beg your pardon, youngling.
I'm sick of your song and dance.
I don't believe a word of it. so spill the beans. shit! Damn it!
You don't believe me? I'll show you something you've never seen.
That no one has ever seen.
That you'll never see again. sit thyself down, and watch.
I'm going to vomit.
Does your tummy ache? where is Mr. Kass?
How did "Jacky" get so rich?
An antique car is no bargain.
It's his own personal fortune.
His family owns this joint.
He wants us to tie the knot. why didn't you tell me from the start?
I did.
You wouldn't listen.
You're right.
I'm sorry Godefroy.
I'm going, Beatrice.
I am very happy to have known you.
Godefroy, I'm so moved. what can I say? we'll never meet again.
It is so unique to be able to touch you, my youngling, my ever-so-young youngling.
You know,
I lied.
I was not searching for a treasure, but for the magic potion.
Pardon me.
No treasure can replace our having met.
Indeed.
Nothing can equal meeting one's descendants.
Bea? Are you there?
My life will seem so boring now.
You must forget me.
You have your children.
Give Florian and Ondine a big kiss from an old ancestor.
And deep in your soul, keep a memory of me.
I love you, my Beatrice.
I love you too.
A secret passage. This way! sergeant-Major Gibon?
Are you okay?
You're not hurt?
No, Jean-Pierre. where did Hubert go?
You're too rational to understand. spare me your lame interpretations.
Answer me, please. where is your cousin?
He left with Mr. Kass.
Is the sheriff gone? what are you saying?
Mr. Kass is here.
Mr. Kass!
Hush! I must find Lady Ginette. who left with...? shit!
A bear is chasing her! steer clear, beloved! steer clear!
Come back!
If you find enough force in yourself, you will be able to change the course of the arrow.
Holy scrotums!
You almost pierced'st me! slay the father of my lady-love?
Your absence was an eternity, dear Godefroy.
- It's hard!
- sorry, beloved.
Jacquasse, where are you, peasant?
Fetch my crossbow.
He's here, sire.
A-snoring in clown clothes. where are we? where's Freddy? who are you?
Take my crossbow.
Oil it at the castle. what are you doing here?
Jump in the river.
You stinketh. so Crass?
Have you been sucking up wine? what the hell is going on?
Obey your Lord. I don't want to whip you on his wedding day!
Indeed!
Obey hastily, my Jacquasse. shit!
Fuck!
Freakkky!
Okkk ayyy!
Hand over your jewels!
Cousin Hubert! what is this nightmare? what the hell is going on?
I'm hallucinating! what the hell is going on? subtitled by Andrew Litvak
A little hello to credit-loverS!
Hi, Douglas.
How's it going?
- What did you do?
- Demo'ed the driveway.
- Nice job, too.
- What's the problem?
It's the wrong driveway.
That's a problem, isn't it?
2933, Vic.
This is 2935!
We're in the wrong...
These guys are morons.
- I'm sorry. It's going to cost.
- It's going to cost who?
I'm in a bad way right now.
Money's very tight with me.
I can't afford to eat this, even if it was my fault.
Shut up, Vic.
What am I going to do?
All right.
We're going to do both driveways.
No matter how long it takes.
And if you say one more word -
- I'll beat you to death with a drywall hammer.
- You got it?
- It makes sense to me. Thank you.
Hello. Kinney.
Problem this morning? Giving away free driveways? Come to my place.
No. Fax those plans right now.
Hold on.
Hi, hon. I was just about to call.
What's the matter?
Really? No, I know what it is.
It's the hot water heater.
My fax machine's gone psycho again.
What's up?
Do you hate me?
Do you want me dead? A guy from
Beverly Hills is going to sue me.
- You ruined his driveway?
- Yes, we did.
- Like a prank?
- No, Del.
Don't worry about it. It's my fault.
I'll fix it on my own time.
When? Ted told me you haven't finished the Malibu job yet.
You know what I think?
- No, what do you think?
- We'll have to put in more hours.
This isn't a nine-to-five job.
We had a saying where I worked last.
"Unless you come in Saturday, don't bother coming in Sunday."
- Are we going to work weekends?
- Weekends, nights, holidays.
My office. Two minutes.
Do you have any stegosauruses?
No. I have an iguanodon and a tyrannosaurus.
I fished a stegosaurus.
Hi. dad.
- Good hand. Hi.
- Did you look at the water heater?
- I just walked in the door.
- No bath tonight, Zack.
Brush your teeth and go to bed.
You missed Campfire Girls.
I'm not in Campfire Girls.
I'm a Brownie.
- It was Jennifer's graduation.
- Man, I forgot!
I phoned and reminded you.
I totally forgot.
Was she upset?
Yes. All the fathers were there.
Even the divorced ones.
- And the lesbian moms?
- Both of them.
- Where is she now?
- In the den. Drinking.
- She's asleep. Where were you?
- I had to work late.
- King fired DeGrazzi.
- You're kidding. Why?
He does bad work.
But at least he does it slowly.
- Who will replace him?
- The guy you sleep with.
The video store guy.
I knew you were dating, but not that you were sleeping with him.
That's great. It's like a promotion.
It's not great?
- Guess who'll do my job.
- You're going to do it all?
- Will they give you more money?
- It's more of a prestige thing.
They'll probably give me a plaque or a certificate for being so great.
That's ridiculous. We hardly ever see you. Can't you say no?
Yes, if you want to catch your own food. Don't worry. It'll be okay.
I'll go check on the water heater.
Jennifer Kinney.
I'll seek the way that'll bring me to the fllre of kindness, -
- Lighted by those who have gone on the Campfllre Trall.
That's so great.
I don't know.
I'll have to think about it.
I really appreciate it.
Thank you.
I'll call you. Thanks. Bye.
- Hi. Hungry?
- No. I'm too tired to eat.
- Who was that?
- Valerie.
Who helped her dial the phone?
Don't start. The company made her regional manager.
When I quit work to have Zack, they thought more of me than of Valerie.
- Did she call to tell you the news?
- No...
She offered me her old job, now that she's been promoted.
- Are you going back to work?
- Yes. What do you think?
What do I think?
The first couple of months you won't make anything because it's hard.
We're paying more for child care.
We're both working and then we're both not going to Campfire Girls.
- Maybe you could help out more.
- How am I going to work that out?
I just meant in emergencies.
A real estate emergency?
My whole life's an emergency.
I'm not going back to work, am l?
We always said I would, but now I realise I never will.
Take my job. Go build condos.
Make sure to be there at 6:00.
Call an exorcist.
I don't know where it came from.
I'm sorry, Laura.
I'm sorry.
This is stupid.
We just need to get a schedule.
We don't need a schedule.
We need a miracle.
GEMINI INSTITUTE
MALIBU. CALIFORNIA
Once we get all this duct work in, this should just fly.
Are you paid to watch her ass?
Because you do an excellent job.
We've got a problem down here.
I don't believe this.
Have a seat.
Damn!
Get out of the way.
Man. what is this?
I'm sorry. I just went crazy.
We'll turn the water back on now.
- This thing goes off all the time.
- Tough business.
- What do you do?
- Not mine. Yours.
Yes, really tough.
What do you do to relax?
- Well, play golf.
- That's a great game. How often?
Let's see...
Never. I'll have to cut back.
That's really going to hurt.
You don't have to live this way.
With all due respect...
I forgot to go to medical school.
- I can help you.
- Help me how?
Change your life.
- What do you guys do around here?
- We make miracles.
Sure.
Call me.
I feel guilty for not spending enough time with my family.
Then I get resentful because l don't have enough time for myself.
Work is first, my family is a close second and I'm a distant third.
- Is that crazy?
- I'm not a psychiatrist.
And you don't need one. Real problems require real solutions.
- Well, then... What do you do?
- I told you. I make miracles. l create time. l make clones.
Doug, sit down.
I'm a geneticist. 15 years ago
I started cloning viruses.
And then, ten years ago,
I cloned an earthworm.
- God bless you, sir.
- And then... a chimp.
And last year...
Last year...
- Hi there.
- Just in time.
- Doug is doing our new offices.
- I know Doug.
He and I went over the plans one day. You were sailing.
Wait a minute.
- You understand my suggestion?
- Sure. What's not to understand?
- You xerox people.
- In a way.
The procedure takes about two hours.
It takes more or less two hours.
Then you have everything you need.
What is it that I need?
- Time!
- All you need. For everything.
Let's say I was interested.
What would a..?
Nothing fancy, just a basic...
What would a basic clone job cost?
- Doctor, we're ready for you.
- Very good.
I hate to sound like a baby, but promise me it'll be all right.
You're going to be fine.
There's nothing to worry about.
- I won't be like them. will I?
- I hope not.
Watch your head.
Lie back and put your feet in the stirrups.
Did you see "The Fly"? Jeff Goldblum came out with enormous eyes.
Peripheral vision is one thing, but this is a bad look.
And he eats everything with these little hands and everything.
Take it easy.
Well... What is that thing?
- This'll help you relax.
- So far it isn't working.
I'm sorry. My uncle went to the dentist, and he was never the same.
I don't know if he got that suction thing lodged in his throat.
But after that he was always,
"Hi, Doug... What's wrong?"
- Count backwards from 100.
- Sure. Like that'll work.
- Am I all right?
- You're fine.
Well?
I mean...
Is it..? Is it a boy?
I mean, did it work?
- Is that it?
- No. I'm afraid you're it.
What do you mean?
I can't be it.
- You mean. I'm the clone?
- That's right.
- No. I'm me. He must be the clone.
- No. I'm me.
- Help me out. I'm me, right?
- Look here.
- I must be me.
- Hold this.
Attaboy.
Now... look here.
- You see that?
- I see a "2".
There you go.
Wait, I remember everything.
I came in. I put this on.
I remember getting the shot.
You have all Doug's feelings and memories right up to the cloning.
But now, when you have different experiences, you'll diverge.
- What do I feed it?
- Feed it? What am l? A hamster?
- Sorry. I mean, it eats something.
- He's a person, just like you.
He'll get duplicate identification here. You take care of the rest.
Now I'll leave you two alone.
You'll have a lot to talk about.
Astonishing.
- What?
- Nothing.
So... Where are you from?
- Stay down low. Really low.
- You want me to get under the car?
Good.
Laura's not home.
- The Mildew Suite.
- We'll fix it all up.
Am I really going to live here?
You can't live with me and Laura.
She'll wake up, roll over and say:
"Doug, you two have to get to work or you'll be late."
Don't worry. We'll clean up, put down some rugs, get a TV...
We ought to get a satellite dish.
Get all the sports and movies...
I don't know about that...
I don't think Laura'll go for that.
- I knew it. You're whipped.
- I'm not whipped.
You're whipped, partner.
- Fine, I'm whipped.
- Some guys are whipped. It's okay.
No, you're right.
We've got to get a plan together.
Think fast. Wear these till you get some of your own.
Don't make me want to kick your ass.
Come on. Come on.
Look at this. This is a great coat. l love this old coat.
- Always use the garden gate.
- We should black out the windows.
Good idea. We have to come up with a strategy for work.
- We're going to get a lot done.
- We're going to kick ass.
- And Ted...
- We're going to destroy Ted.
We'll ruin him. Bring him down.
Crush him. And I'll break his neck.
Laura's home.
Hi, honey.
Zack, help me.
- What are you doing up there?
- I was looking for something.
- You look really beautiful today.
- I do?
Do you want to go to the pony rides?
We could go to the movies tonight.
We could car pool, if you want.
No, I could pick you up.
- Doug! When did you get here?
- Six. Half day today, Teddy?
Let's have that meeting now, Del.
Here's the report on the Palisades.
- When did you do all this?
- We should do them every morning.
Two minutes. Conference room.
Sure...
Find out what he had for breakfast.
- Morning. Meeting start yet?
- I thought you were in the meeting.
- Did you see me?
- Yes, but in a different shirt.
Yes, but do you know why?
I spilled coffee on it.
- Then I went to my truck when...
- I was in the ladies room?
Perfect. I have another shirt. which I keep for emergencies.
Like when I spill coffee.
Also, I got out my briefcase.
Then I came back. and I forgot the meeting had started.
- Shouldn't you go back in?
- Yes, but I must go to the truck.
I'll get the original shirt.
It's dry now. And I like it better.
So when I come out of the meeting
I'll be wearing the original shirt.
- Are you okay?
- No problem. Never been better.
Why don't you forget all about it?
- Del King Construction.
- Is Doug Kinney there?
- He's in a meeting. Who is it?
- Carl.
- Roger.
- Roger who?
Carl Rogerson.
Phone call for you, Doug.
- What's going on?
- Who is it?
It's me. You.
It's us.
Hold on. I'll take it in my office.
I'm too busy to talk to myself.
- What's up?
- What are you doing there?
- Where should I be?
- I mean, you just went to work?
- You wanted to be home more.
- Yes, but we must discuss this.
We have to coordinate some stuff.
Anyway, how's it going?
Good. Everything's under control.
I'll go out to the Palisades later.
- Then I'll go by Sherman Oaks.
- I took care of it, pal.
- I'll go to North Hollywood.
- I'll do that on the way.
- Reseda?
- Already did it.
I'll tell you what then...
What should I do?
I don't know. Start living it up.
I've got to go.
Kinney!
You think you're hot shit.
But you won't fool anybody.
You read me?
I'm on top of you.
I see you, my friend.
Take this one.
What are you doing?
Don't kick it.
It's not soccer.
Fall on it! Fall on the ball!
Defence, let's go.
Zack!
- Mom said you had to work.
- You're playing, I'm coming.
You looked good.
Go sit with your team.
I don't pay 160 bucks to sit and watch my kid eat oranges.
He played four downs. That's all
I have to play him. Period.
Let go of that. I'm a lawyer, not just a coach. I'll kick your ass...
Don't touch me! Back off.
I've had it!
- I don't need this.
- Don't pay attention to those guys.
I'm doing the best I can do.
It's not like I'm getting paid.
- No. You could be out playing golf.
- I love golf.
They don't know what they're talking about. I appreciate what you do.
Can I mention one thing? You should think about a multiple-set offence.
- Four of these kids are morons.
- I understand. If you used Zack...
- Zack is my kid.
- That's it. Here you go.
You turn this franchise around.
See you in the Super Bowl.
- Hi. What are you doing?
- Dad's cooking dinner.
- Spaghetti?
- Yes. Just like the old days.
Dad's the new football coach.
He's great. We scored!
We've got a good team.
Go get washed up for dinner.
Thanks for coaching, Dad.
- I thought you had extra work.
- Not any more.
- Did you get fired?
- No, no.
I was tired of carrying that heavy load, so I went in to King and said:
"You either get me some help or I'm walking." Taste this.
- What did he say?
- What do you think he said?
I thought he was going to cry.
But he agreed to hire some help.
- The guy's like an assistant.
- I'm glad. Who?
Who? You mean, who's the guy?
Just a guy.
A new guy you don't know.
Very new guy.
- What you're saying is, he's new?
- He's going to run everything.
- And you trust him?
- Yes, like I trust myself.
- Great. What will you do now?
- Now? I don't know.
Right now I thought
I might do this.
- I want you to take that new job.
- My job? You mean it?
Yes! I can still drop off the kids at school and I can leave by three.
So if you can just back me up occasionally.
- Let's get the kids to bed early.
- What time is it?
- Kids, bedtime!
Hi, Doug.
- Hi. Vic. What time is it?
- It's... 5:30 in New York.
- Then it's 2:30 here.
- Why is it on New York time?
I bought it in New York and couldn't reset the darn thing.
- When did I tell you to be here?
- No specific time.
Yes. 1 :30.
In fact, I repeated it twice.
Do you want solid or laminate?
That's strange. For some reason
2:30 just stuck in my head.
I'll stick something in your head.
You're fired.
Take your New York watch and your fat ass and get out of here.
- For being a few minutes late?
- No, no. Three, four. That's a few.
You were 60 minutes late.
That's not a few. Hit it.
Is this a negotiating tactic?
I'm on my way.
Take your hands off me, now.
Now I'm getting mad. You've made a point. What's happening now?
Are you guys on a break?
Let's go!
- What got into you today?
- I should've fired him long ago.
- But he has like 34 kids.
- He's been married 17 times.
- What have you got there?
- You ought to see these plans.
Hi, it's me. I need to work late.
Could you pick up the kids?
- Sure.
- It's not that simple.
- It's picture day at ballet class.
- That'll be cute.
Go home, give her a bath, mousse her hair and be there at 4:30.
- Can you do this?
- I can do it. I'll see you.
Okay. Bye.
- Hello?
- Take the kids to the ballet.
- Wait. I was just teeing off here.
- Not today, pal. See you later.
I don't want a shower.
I want a bath. I hate showers!
Zack, get her on that side.
Contain her.
- You're going.
- I'm not going.
Let me see.
Turn around.
Good. I like it.
Let's go.
Hi. Sorry we're late.
We're here for the pictures.
Didn't anyone call you?
It was changed to tomorrow.
- No, seriously. The pictures.
- Tomorrow.
Get a photographer down here now.
- Right now.
- I'll see what I can do.
Hello? She's not here right now.
You can leave a message.
Hold on a second.
Can you call back?
I have a little emergency here.
One of the kids swallowed a spoon.
No, just a teaspoon. She'll live.
Keep it down!
- He took it.
- Zack, give it back to her.
I'm telling you, give it back.
- Doodyhead!
- You're a doodyhead.
Bath time. Go on up and don't come out till you're married.
- Could we have some cake?
- Get up there.
I'm sorry. This couple wanted to see the same house over and over.
- We're both here.
- Of course, sir. Right this way.
- This is like having an affair.
- We're too busy to have an affair.
I think he likes you.
I like him too, but there's no future in it. Besides, I have you.
What are we celebrating?
You know.
I've been thinking...
- This isn't working out.
- What?
This new arrangement.
I'm not getting anything done.
All I do is cook and do laundry.
I pick up and drop off the kids, dress them and clean up after them.
I've done that for ten years.
You've done it for a month.
- It comes more naturally to you.
- How so?
You're a nurturer. You are.
First of all you have two
X-chromosomes, and I have...
It's scientifically proven. That's why you have breasts and I don't.
Just what are you saying?
This system isn't working. We have to go back to the way it was.
You take care of the house. and I do what I need to do.
And what do you need to do?
I have to go back to work.
And that's it.
No, that's not it. I love my job, and I'm doing great at it.
Valerie is moving me into estates.
I'll be making a good living soon.
I know it's hard, and I can imagine your day, but I'm not quitting.
We'll just have to work it out.
And that is it.
It's funny you think that's it.
Because that's not it.
What I said... That's it.
What you said... not it.
No, Doug. This is it.
I can't believe you lured me here for this.
Can I have some water?
I didn't lure you into anything.
I had no idea. You tease me and I kind of liked it...
But I thought you were a happily married guy.
- I sleep in the guest house.
- My God. Is it that bad?
It's pretty bad.
She's sleeping with another guy.
That's the God's honest truth.
- She doesn't even know I exist.
- It must be so hard for you.
- It is.
- Do you want to go to my place?
- I understand...
- Doug, are you all right?
- What's wrong?
- It's a football injury. Rose Bowl.
- You played?
- I fell out of the bleachers.
Can I help you to the car?
- Let's get some dessert.
- You're still hungry?
My life's a shambles.
I need pie.
Can you breathe?
Should I Heimlich you?
- I'll get you some more water.
- No! Laura! Look at me.
- How do I look?
- Crazy.
Let's order. Let's get something to eat. We'll feel better.
- I'm going to the ladies' room.
- Me too. To the men's room.
I mean, I'll accompany you to...
You know what I mean.
Boy, everything looks so good.
Doug, that's the wine list.
I thought there were a hell of a lot of beverages on there.
Will you order? You know what I like. Anything with barbecue sauce.
- What are you doing here?
- It's my favourite restaurant.
- I know. What about Noreen?
- She's a colleague. We're talking.
- Come on. You're up to something.
- Are you jealous?
- You can't cheat on Laura.
- You can't. I never get to see her.
- This isn't working out.
- What do you mean?
Our deal. We'll switch. I'll go back to work and you'll stay home.
I'm going to do housework?
I thought you were joking. There's no way that's ever going to happen.
I got you the job, pal!
You think I'm a genie? You rub a lamp and I do what you want me to?
- I have things I need to do.
- Look, things change...
You took away my wife, my family, my friends. All I have is my job.
I'm doing the work you couldn't do.
And I'm making it pay, so back off.
- I'm just washing his face.
- Of course. Please, carry on.
- What are you doing?
- I had to do something.
We'll talk later. I'll distract
Laura. Get Noreen out of here.
He's in way over his head.
Doug, I'm ready for dessert.
That's not your sport coat.
I switched with a guy in the men's room.
We traded. Men do that all the time.
- Let's go.
- I thought you wanted pie.
It's your wife!
- May we join you?
- Have we met?
- What happened to your shirt?
- Water spots.
- I don't want to fight about this.
- Great.
- About what?
- My job.
Hell, no. We don't want to fight about that. That'd be dumb.
- Laura, do you love me?
- Of course I love you.
Then kiss me.
Come on. Let's go.
That guy looks a lot...
I'm sorry... He's kissing her!
- Come on.
- Stop pushing?
Hi.
Can I talk to you for a second?
Sure.
You want a beer?
Actually I could use a couple.
Two, I'd like you to meet...
- Three.
- Hi, how are you?
Are you nuts?
Are you mentally nuts?
- I have it all figured out.
- What do we need him for?
He's going to help me with the kids, and when you're not working -
- you guys can hang out together.
- I'm giddy!
- We could do a lot together.
- You're lonely. I got you a friend.
- Where is he going to stay?
Here with you. That way you have a friend and a roommate. Look at him.
I have an idea. How about no?
Doug, he needs space.
It's a shock. I think.
The idea was for you to work while
I was with Laura and the kids.
Well, it isn't working. I need a break, so I can work on the house.
Or sit and think a single thought.
Or play golf every once in a while.
I've been working since I was
12 years old. It's break time.
I think the 12-year-old is saying:
"You need time for Doug."
- What a suck!
- I don't know what a suck is.
- Come on. For Doug.
- Fine. Screw your life up.
- You're in way over your head.
- You're two good-looking guys.
- I'll make this up to you.
- Start by cloning Laura.
Cloning, Laura...
Bye, Doug. Have a good time.
I'm worried about him.
He's uptight, isn't he?
He'll be all right.
That's a lot of ribs.
What is that? A slab?
Okay kids, hurry up.
We're going to be late.
Books, jackets.
I'll drive the kids to school. Take a couple of minutes to yourself.
- Thanks.
- That's all right.
Look, what I said about you quitting your job... Forget it.
You have as much right to work as I do.
- You mean it?
- I mean it.
I just want you to be happy.
I'll give you a foot rub tonight.
- How's it going?
- Fine. I'm baking. Where are you?
At the Laker game. I meant to go home, but I felt like stopping here.
Have a good time.
- Did you hear from Two?
- He's still at work.
The guy's a horse.
I'll be home soon.
All right.
See you.
- What happened?
- Nothing. I had a terrible dream.
- What was it? Your dream?
- I don't know.
Go back to sleep.
Everything will be okay.
What was that all about?
Up there, with Laura?
- Who won the game?
- Don't worry about that. Lakers.
- What were you doing in bed?
- Nothing.
We were watching TV. Laura wanted to go to bed. What could I do?
What do you mean,
"she wanted to go to bed"?
- What do you mean?
- You know what I mean.
- Did you have sex with my wife?
- No!
No, Douglas! Here was the plan.
When she was asleep, I'd sneak out.
I guess I dozed off.
Nothing happened.
She did kind of brush me in that region, but I mamboed out of there.
Doug, he mamboed out.
Listen to me. Both of you.
Rule number one.
It's unbreakable.
Don't even try to bend this rule.
Nobody has sex with my wife but me.
Fabulous rule, Doug.
- No clone nookie.
- You're the man, Doug.
Original nookie only.
- We're clear on that rule, right?
- Absolutely. It's locked in here.
- So, did you?
- No!
- Wimp.
- Slob.
The mambo king.
Watch the stern there!
Number eight, it's a boat, not a bathtub.
- Did you enjoy sailing?
- It was more like bumper cars.
How about a nice
"I sailed with Walt" T-shirt?
Do you have an
"I got a refund from Walt" T-shirt?
I'd like to learn how to sail.
Do you have anything big enough -
- to take my whole family out and not end up like Gilligan?
Great show. Remember the one with the Harlem Globetrotters?
That was good. Believable, too.
- What the hell are you doing?
- How many of you are there?
That's our brother Doug. This is
Patti and Beth. We were dancing.
One's cuter than the next.
Are you as much fun as Lance and Rico?
Lance and Ri..?
- You're Rico, I'm guessing.
- Guess again.
Even he can't tell them apart.
Look, can we have some privacy?
We have to have a family meeting.
- Wait..
- We were going to have a party.
- You're kidding, right?
- No.
- Are you a drag or what?
- Try to keep your voices down.
Goodnight, Lance!
Goodnight, Rico!
The adventures of Lance and Rico.
- Where did you meet them, Lance?
- They work at the Minimart.
Yes, they're clerks.
- Were the Slurpee girls busy?
- I stopped to pick up my dinner.
She offered to nuke my corn dog.
What am I going to say? No?
So we came back here to party.
- They were two very nice women.
- "Women" being the key word here.
You can't just bring strangers up here.
- Are we supposed to be monks?
- He has a point.
A damn good point.
- What are you doing?
- What do you mean?
- I'm having a smoke.
- I can see that, but why?
I spent 1,000 dollars to quit.
Remember?
- Looks like it didn't take.
- Don't ever do that again.
- What are you going to do about it?
- I'll hit you so hard, he'll die.
Guys, come on. Let's sit down and talk. You're angry. Like two lions.
- Shut up.
- I'm sorry.
- Where's your aspirin?
- Tylenol. In the kitchen.
I'll find it.
I'll find it.
Look at this place. It's a mess.
I can't leave you for a minute.
One, two, three, four.
Doug, if I might...
One, two, three...
- Four...
- Twelve.
Doug, I'd like you to meet Four.
I got a wallet.
That guy gave it to me.
I'm going to drive a car.
He's got a wallet.
Come here. Come here.
- Where did he come from?
- He'll help us out around here.
Do the day-to-day stuff. Clean the house, take out the trash and so on.
Forget that!
What the hell is wrong with him?
Nothing.
Nothing's really wrong.
He's a little special.
He's fine. He'll be all right.
- He's special, all right.
- We made a copy from Two.
Sometimes a copy from a copy is not quite as sharp as the original.
Leeds loved it. because it was very experimental.
We got a great deal.
Leeds loved it?
Good. Because I hate it.
You can't just go around cloning people. That's crazy!
Listen up.
Listen really clearly to me.
Rule number two. First of all...
We all remember rule number one.
- No sleeping with your wife.
- That's important.
- Rule number two: No more Dougs.
- This is plenty, I think.
I'll call Leeds tomorrow. We're out of the Doug-making business.
- Am I clear? Am I clear on this?
- The book's closed on that one.
I like pizza.
I like it!
We're going to need a cage.
Bye, Steve.
Good party.
I like Steve.
- How did it go?
- I'm telling you, this is great!
You want some really great sailing?
Bring Mrs. Doug tomorrow -
- and come to Catalina with Robin and me on my big boat.
We'll cruise the Avalon Harbour at sunset. Champagne on board.
We'd leave you alone. You make love right on the boat. Very romantic.
- Think about Catalina.
- I'll call you.
Honey, may I do that?
I want to show you something.
First of all, this piece of aluminium foil is too small.
It can't cover it all, so you'll get that hard crust around the meat. -
- and nobody wants to eat that.
At Christmas time we can make an ornament out of it.
And save those fries. We'll paint them and hang them on the tree.
The kids are going to love that.
Okay, we'll take a fresh piece.
Now we fold up one side.
Make sure we're even.
Then I fold once. twice or three times. Whatever you need to fold it.
But don't just roll it over. Then you have that lump in the middle.
Fold it nicely, so no air gets in there. Air is our enemy.
Then take this.
Tuck, tuck, fold. T.T.F.
Two tucks and a fold.
I just think of Elizabeth Taylor.
Now roll it over nice and flat.
No air is going to get in there.
We could send it off to NASA and nothing would happen. Now, the lid.
That's very nice.
Very nice.
Doug, I've noticed some things about you lately that make me think...
- What?
- Nothing.
Go like this.
Can I just do something?
See what that does? It frames you better. It gives you height.
Why don't you go relax and let me finish cleaning up?
Why?
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.
Freezer. Second shelf.
With all the other meat products.
Unless it's in a skin casing.
Then it goes lower... In the bin.
That was a great meal, honey.
- You cooked it.
- But you ate it.
Were you wearing that shirt earlier?
- This? Yes, sure.
- I'm losing it.
Dad, watch this.
- I'll show you "walking the dog".
- You just showed me before dinner.
I did?
That's right. I forgot.
You want to go get some ice cream?
Unless we already did.
- Doug, did you decide?
- Did I decide what?
What we talked about all evening.
You said you'd think about it.
I did.
I gave it a lot of thought.
What did you think?
Well, I gave it a lot of thought.
I think whatever you think is probably the smartest thing to do.
Don't put this all on me.
They're your kids, too.
Can I say something?
Let's leave the kids out of this.
You want to go to Disney World without the kids?
No. I don't want to do that.
That wouldn't be fair to the kids.
To go, just you and me, would be stupid. When is it we're going?
- Christmas. I bought the tickets.
- Are you nuts?
- You told me to buy them.
- Not me.
- Not me. Not me.
- You're driving me crazy!
I call and you bite my head off.
At times you're as sweet as can be.
Then you're obsessed with details, and now you don't even listen to me.
- What is going on with you?
- Nothing. Nothing's wrong with me.
You could have bipolar disorder or multiple personalities.
Let's sail to Catalina.
- Drink wine and make love.
- Doug, you don't sail.
But I drink and make love.
The sailing... How hard can it be?
We can't just sail off to Catalina.
Let's be spontaneous!
We used to do stuff like this.
You're the one who wants to go to Ecuador and throw harpoons.
- Doug, that's just talk.
- Let's do it. Why not?
Your job. My job. Jennifer's dance recital. The Donaldsons' party.
- I'm not going to that.
- You said you were.
When you figure out what you want, would you just let me know?
- Hello?
- In here, Doug.
Three?
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Sure, Doug.
- What's up?
- I have to go away.
- It's a business trip.
- Business trip?
- I handle the business.
- He does. Steve.
Fine. it's not business. I need to be alone and figure some things out.
You need to get centered. Good idea.
You deserve that.
- You have to be me night and day.
- What about rule number one?
Rule number one. Steve!
What's rule number one?
Rain Man, go floss yourself.
The rule stands. Remember when I had a bronchial infection? You got it.
Cough. Tell her you don't want her to catch it. Can you handle that?
- I have a sore throat and a fever.
- Do you want me to handle it?
- No. Thanks, though.
- I'm just trying to help out.
- Is he safe with that?
- We take the blade out.
We shave him while he's sleeping.
It's cute.
All right, I'm counting on you.
Hi. Walt.
- Where's your wife?
- She couldn't make it.
Don't you want to wait until she can come?
- No. she'll come next time.
- All right. Come aboard.
Doug...
I'm sorry. I understand why you wanted us to go away together.
It sounded romantic. But we don't have to go away to make love.
- Are you all right?
- I'm coming down with something.
I've got a lot of phlegm, and I'm burning up.
I think I have a fever.
We'd better not get close tonight.
- I'm not worried.
- I don't want you to get sick.
I just think... You know what?
Maybe if you'd not do that...
- Maybe I ought to sleep in the den.
- Just relax.
Hey, did you hear from your parents?
How are they?
I'm really feeling sick.
I'm going to make you feel better.
- You weren't that sick after all.
- No. I guess not.
That was so unusual.
I've never seen you cry like that.
That time when the souffle fell.
But besides that... l guess I was just moved by it all.
- You know what I want now?
- No.
Graham crackers and chocolate milk.
- You want some?
- No, thanks. I've had plenty.
What have I done?
What have I done?
- Hey! Who ate all the bologna?
- Burglars.
- Did you eat everything?
- Count Chocula.
That's it. I'm starving. I'll sneak in and get something to eat.
Doug, you startled me!
Change your mind?
Yes, I changed my mind.
I think.
Want some?
You taste good.
You taste pretty good yourself.
Remember when we used to make love all over the house?
I remember.
Aren't you hungry?
Boy, I could go for one of these...
... canned hams.
Wait. I don't know if this is... the worst idea in the world.
I don't think we should do this. l have a really bad cough.
Of course it could clear up in a second.
I want you.
I'm not so sure... Okay.
Grab that.
That was athletic.
Better than the Stair-Master.
I guess I got a little carried away.
Are you all right?
Shouldn't we go back upstairs?
- I guess. Here.
- Thanks.
Laura, I almost forgot. There are some things I have to take care of.
- I'll be up in a minute.
- The kids.
I forgot to shut the windows in the Volvo.
No problem. I'll get it.
Sorry about yelling!
Steve?
Oh, baby!
You're drenched.
I'm sorry. Come upstairs.
I don't know what I was thinking.
You're soaking. Come on and get out of these wet clothes.
I'm sorry, I was so selfish.
Let me help you with those pants.
Again?
- My peepee.
- I see.
So much for rule number one.
A hell of a ride.
Maybe we'll get the onshore wind tomorrow. That'll be easier.
You ought to sit up or you'll start feeling ill again.
- I'm sorry I hurled on your dog.
- It's not the first time.
Some people really shouldn't sail.
Maybe not. I was pretty miserable there for a while.
It wasn't just the getting sick part.
When I was down there with my head in the head...
My whole life actually flashed before my eyes.
The funny part is...
I wasn't in it.
I've got to get back into my life.
I have no idea what the hell you're talking about.
But good luck to you.
- 103. You're not going anywhere.
- You're not going anywhere, Steve.
- The building inspector's coming.
- You're too sick to go anywhere.
- Del King.
- Del? It's Doug.
- How are you doing?
- Not good. I can't make it today.
- Why don't you rip out my liver?
- You're being a little dramatic?
If we don't get inspected today, that guy won't be back for a month.
I understand. But I'm really ill.
Can't someone else meet him?
Nobody knows this job like you do.
Get down here or you're fired!
Nice attitude. Del.
- He said...
- I heard him. I have to go.
- You can't go.
- I have to go.
- Maybe I'll lie down for a...
- Take care of him. I'm going.
Sorry, Steve, that leg has to come off.
All right.
So these are the water pipes.
And you've got hot and cold available in all units.
That's very nice.
And what's that? It looks like...
It's the gas line, which would feed natural gas to all appliances -
- which would require natural gas.
You're not answering the question.
- What was the question?
- The plan showed two-inch lines.
Go like this.
You've got something... That's it.
- Why did you go with one-inch?
- That's right. Now I remember.
So what's the answer?
Can you excuse me for a second?
Why did you decide to use one-inch gas lines?
Knock it off!
Originally there were two ovens, but King cut it back to one.
Got it. I remember now. The original plan called for two ovens.
Somebody decided to cut back to one to save money, I guess.
I like a double oven.
Sure there's a lot of bending, -
- but you can have a turkey in the bottom and rutabaga up top.
- It's nice for entertaining.
- But you stubbed out for two.
What if someone wants two ovens?
I don't know.
Hold on a second.
- This is ridiculous.
- Wait...
He can't answer the questions, he runs off. You know what that means?
- Alcohol and drugs.
- God knows what he's done here.
Because of the oven we took the laundry room off this line.
- We ran a separate line for that.
- What about the gas fireplaces?
Thinking. Thinking.
Boy, does he have some tough ones.
He doesn't know what he's doing.
Wait a second.
You're entitled to your opinion.
But it's not fair to judge anyone after one superficial conversation.
- We have to re-inspect everything.
- Kinney. Doug Kinney.
Stop all work until further notice.
I'll be back in about three weeks.
Get your act together or you'll lose your license. And get him some help.
You what?
You got fired? How?
No, no, no.
Just come home.
Doug, what are you doing home?
- Are you sick?
- Yes. We're out of Pepto-Bismol.
- What about your big inspection?
- I guess I missed it, didn't I?
Wasn't it important? I rearranged everything so you could go.
What are you, some kind of saint?
Do you want me to give you a medal?
Now I feel better.
Doug, you've been under a lot of pressure lately.
But when you talk like that,
I think you mean it. It hurts me.
Something is happening lately.
I feel like I don't know you.
It scares me, Doug.
You tell yourself that your problems aren't serious.
They happen to everyone. You hope they'll go away, but they don't.
It's like this house.
You always said you'd fix it up.
"I'll fix it," you always say.
But nothing ever gets fixed.
I need to know what you're feeling.
I need to know if you still love me.
Please, just tell me what you want.
I want pizza.
What?
I want pizza.
Give me some pizza.
Hey! Are you guys crazy?
What if Laura walks in?
Not much chance of that, sport.
- Where is she?
- She left you.
Nothing but tail lights.
She took the kids and went to her mother's. They're in Palm Springs.
- I'm sorry. Did you eat?
- Forget that! Wait a minute.
- What happened with Laura?
- We had a fight.
- Why were you even talking to her?
- It's complicated.
I was pissed off because I got fired.
No. he did. You couldn't answer a few, simple, basic questions.
Simple questions? It was like being on Jeopardy, for crying out loud.
- Knock it off!
- Puke-face.
Did you bring me a monkey?
- There's something else.
- What?
About rule number one...
What about it?
We bent it a little.
We bent it a lot.
Damn near broke the thing off.
- Did you sleep with my wife?
- Let's have some tea.
I'm sorry, Doug.
She's a powerful woman.
Take it easy!
She thought it was you.
The fact is...
She thought I was you, too.
- We're not perfect.
- We're not perfect.
I don't believe this!
I leave you alone for one day!
And you totally destroy my life.
We didn't destroy your life.
You did.
Actually, we were trying to save it, and we were doing pretty good.
We just had one really bad day.
We tried. She was unstoppable.
It was like she couldn't get...
She touched my peepee, Steve.
I don't understand this.
We've had fights before, but...
Why did she leave?
- You don't fix stuff.
- What?
You always say you're going to fix stuff, and then you don't.
Did Laura say that?
Maybe.
You talked to her before she left?
Maybe.
I don't remember.
This will refresh your memory.
Where do you put all that stuff?
Did you?
Did she tell you something?
She talked to me a lot.
She was afraid and she cried.
She cried?
She cried, because...
- Because I don't fix anything?
- She's scared.
She's scared.
- I'll buy you a present for this.
- A chainsaw?
Or a book. Something really nice.
Come on up.
I'm spitting on bugs.
- What's going on?
- I need you guys to help me.
I'm putting my life back together.
Come on. Let's go.
- About time.
- Polyblend.
- Steve, can I help?
- Grab the end of that plastic.
You said to be here at 8:30.
I'd like you to note the time.
- This thing drives me nuts.
I'm sorry I spoke to you like that.
You're the best cement man alive.
- Really?
- No. No one else was available.
I can accept that.
You said you had your own guys?
Hi. Vic.
- Let's go to work.
- Fair enough.
Okay, you heard him.
I made some really tasty sandwiches if you want one.
Great.
- Tuna with curried mayonnaise.
- I like that.
That's why I made them.
Let me ask you something.
The other night, when you were...
- When you were with Laura...
- I'll tell you something.
When she wants something, there's no stopping her.
- I don't want any details.
- No, no. I know.
You think that...
... that she liked you better than she likes me?
Of course not, Doug.
First of all, you are me.
- I am you. Do you understand?
- Yes, that's right.
I'm me, you're me and I'm you.
I know she loves you, Doug.
I wasn't there for her.
Even when I was there
I wasn't there.
Remember what you said about quality time with your family?
Trust me. It's all quality time.
That's for sure.
You have to brush your teeth.
Don't forget your books and jackets.
Grandpa will take you to school.
Dad! Did you come to take us home?
Go inside and let me talk to Dad.
You can see Daddy later.
Come on, you guys.
Hurry up.
- How was the desert?
- Great. Just what I needed.
I saw on the weather that it was like 175 degrees.
It was a little hot.
All right, here's the deal.
I'm going to ask you to come home.
But I won't plead with you.
If you say yes, great.
But don't expect me to stand in front of the neighbours and beg.
I don't think...
Stop it. Get up. Why didn't you talk to me? It was mean.
- That wasn't me.
- That's just the point.
I was a little confused about who
I was. All right, real confused.
Look, it's happened to you.
You want to be a mom and to work.
You want to be independent, but you need to be taken care of a little.
- It gets confusing, doesn't it?
- Yes.
Come home, so I can show you something.
Come on.
Just for a minute.
It's beautiful. Oh, Doug.
This is perfect.
Great, right?
The wall's gone.
It's just like I dreamed...
I'm so glad you like it.
It's so pretty.
How did you do this?
I had some of the boys do some work and we just got it done.
If you put your mind to it, you can do anything.
- What do you think?
- I think it's a miracle.
It's good, right? I told you
I'd finish it. I just needed time.
I'm thinking of starting my own business. What do you think?
That way I could set my own hours.
I don't want to do anything big. l want to start with small projects.
Bird houses and mail boxes.
Stuff like that.
That'd be nice.
I love you so much.
I mean, I just...
I just really love you.
Whatever I do. whatever you need to do...
As long as we're both rowing the same boat we'll be fine.
- Bye, honey!
- See you.
Bye!
Where are you guys headed?
- Wherever the road takes us.
- Maybe Florida. Stop off in Vegas.
We're going to eat a dolphin.
- No, you're going to pet one.
- Right. We'll pet a dolphin.
- Will you be all right?
- We'll be okay.
- We'll be fine. Don't worry.
- How about you? You'll be okay?
I'm going to be fine.
I'll tell you one thing.
You're three good-looking guys.
- When he's right, he's right.
- I guess.
- I'll see you.
- Bye, Doug.
See you, Steve.
If a T. Rex fought with a tank...
Who'd win?
I don't know, honey.
Mom?
You know how to tell you love someone?
When everyone reminds you of them.
Dear Doug.
Greetings from sunny Miami.
We've been open for six months and business is booming.
Two is happy because he gets to meet new people every day.
You know how nice he can be when he wants to.
I'm cooking up a storm and having a ball.
The pizzas are selling like crazy.
People just love my pepperoni.
And you'd be so proud of Four.
He's working two jobs. In the morning he delivers newspapers.
And the rest of the day he delivers pizzas for us.
English subtitles: IFT
L.A. is like nowhere.
Everybody who lives here is lost
NOWHERE
Hey, Dark.
- Hey what, Mel?
You want me to?
Well.
Beg for it.
Hi. My name's
Montgomery.
Hi. - You have got the deepest, blackest eyes I've ever seen.
It's like I could just tumble right into 'em, fall forever
I just love the smell of fear and boy mixed together, don't you, Kriss?
What're you gawking at?
Looks like we've got a deviant on our hands here, Kozy.
And we just hate, hate, hate any sort of deviation from the norm.
Deviants are the scourge contaminating this Great Nation
Dark?
Are you flogging the puppy again?
Lemme in. I gotta wash this crap off my face!
Mom, can you wait just a sec, please?
Honey, I have to rot my life away in a 9-to-5 hellhole to support your lazy, juvenile delinquent ass, remember?
Sweetheart, chipmunk, my little ray of sunshine open up this motherhumping door now!
Jesus, can you hold on?
Gripes, it's as soggy as an armpit in here.
How long've you been in that shower abusing yourself?
You pump your handle too much, young man.
It's gonna wither up and fall off!
SHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT UP!
Bitch.
Mel, I gotta make a documentary about someone
I care about 'n' it's due next Wednesday.
And who ever said you care about me anyways?
Didn't I give you my Cap'n Crunch
Decoder Ring back in the sixth grade?
That was Angelique Tewksbury, dorkball.
Hey, take your shirt off.
Come on.
It'll give Professor Starkweather a boner 'n' he'll gimme an 'A'.
I'm sure.
Take your Prozac, Dark.
What's the matter?
You scared?
No.
- Think of the scandal.
Everyone in class'll be all outraged.
Is this what you wanna see?
Oh yeah.
Man.
City morgue, you stab 'em, we slab 'em.
S'up, bonzo dog breath? Need a ride to class? - Nah. I'm not goin'.
Dark, you are gonna totally bite the eight whole credits you're retaking this semester
I gotta do some editing on my 101 project, then
I'll prob'ly head over to the Hole for some chow
Maybe I'll go with. I just got my period so I'm in full-tilt pigout mode.
And make sure you edit my boobs out.
I do not want every wally on campus oglin' my chimichangas.
Hey, Lucifer's not with you, is she?
I cannot stomach seeing her butt-ugly likeness this early in the day.
Lick my box, Rover!
Clean the maggots out of it first, you stinky oyster. - You guys
I mean it, Mel. I do not want to have to look at that tarantula woman over my morning espresso
Don't be a seizure queen.
We'll pick you up in fifteen.
Mel, I told you, I'm editing - Seeya, loverboy.
How you can continue to frog that annoying buttloaf when you have someone as sexy 'nd rad as me around.
What would life be without a little mystery?
Mel?
- Quoi?
You wenches done in there or what?
I gotta whiz like a busted firehose.
Finale.
- If it isn't widdle baby Zero.
Cut it out.
Bye, gross, huh?
So you uh, hittin'
Jujyfruit's party tonight?
Puh-leeze, Zero.
How did you hear about it?
You are not invited, shrimpskin.
You're barely old enough to shave.
Felch me.
C'mon, I got a date with Zoe
'n' she totally wants to go.
I already scored the car from Mom. - Life sucks.
I have got the skeeviest zit sproutin' right in the middle of my forehead.
It's gonna be a full-on third eye by the time we get to Jujyfruit's party.
Hate that.
What I hate is when you get a zit way down on your back in a spot where you can't even reach to pop it.
If you pop a zit on your forehead, you can get blood poisoning and die, y'know.
Lucifer, you are so dumb, you should donate your brain to a monkey science fair.
I read it in Mouth 2
Mouth, scrotal fungus.
Mel, what's this?
Dark being born.
Mature.
Yuk yuk yuk.
Whoa, Mel, back it up.
- What?
Just back up, alright?
Need a lift?
- Well
You're in my Modern
Society class, aren't you?
Yeah, I think. - Name's
Dark-thats "Dark" like absence of light Or "Dork" like we all call him.
Cram it, furburger.
This is Mel, 'n' the loudmouth hag is Lucifer.
Montgomery.
We're on our way to the Hole for breakfast. Wanna join?
I, kinda have a class.
- We'll eat quick 'n' drop you.
C'mon
So what's with the camcorder?
You in film class?
Dark thinks he's gonna be the next Clive Barker-right.
Eat my turbo, willya Lucifer?
Actually, I'm convinced
I'm gonna die soon in like a spectacular plane crash, fire, chemical explosion
'n' I wanna film it so there'll be this like cool record of my own death.
So I take my camera with me wherever I go
Isn't that just so bitchen
Will you please Shut
- Up?
How do you know?
- Know what?
That you're gonna, y'know die.
I feel it.
Like a prenomination.
- You mean "premonition".
Whatever. - Well, I don't understand, how can you have one if you can't even pronounce the frigging word?
I am about to lose my temper, Lucifer.
And I am going to deck you.
- C'mon.
You guys
Alyssa.
Ooops.
Clumsy me.
Hi Montgomery.
What're you doing here?
Aren't you s'posed to be in
Thermonuclear Catastrophes class?
Yeah, well, uh Hey.
Do you know what today is?
Friday?
- No, dodo-bird.
It's Armageddon Day.
The day the world is supposed to end.
Like have you heard of "The Rapture"?
The Siouxsie and the Banshees album?
No. It's like this radical religious movement in South Cambodia.
And all these thousands of people are giving up their worldly possessions and leaving their families
All in preparation for
'The Rapture", ascending into Heaven on the day that Christ returns to earth and the world is destroyed.
And according to those scriptures, today is that day.
So, like, what're we s'posed to do?
I don't know.
- Alyssa.
Are you gonna join us back here on Planet
Earth sometime this decade or what?
Hi Dingbat.
Hey Montgomery.
- Hi
Alyssa, me 'n' Egg been waitin' for like eons.
Hey, Dingbat. Can you, help me study for the History of Lethal Epidemics midterm?
Sunday, nine-ish?
- Cool.
Are you goin' to the
Kick The Can game tonight?
Duh.
Yes.
C'mon. I am fully prepared to pork major.
Bye, Montgomery.
- Bye. - Seeya.
I gotta burn these calories fast before I blow up.
Let's go rollerblading or something?
I'd rather have my ball hairs burned off with an acetylene torch.
Well, that can be arranged.
I better get back to class.
Are you OK, man?
You look kinda pale.
Yeah, I'm fine.
I gotta go.
- We're on our way out, we'll drive you.
You sure y'don't wanna come with?
I think I'm gonna go to the recordstore.
- How now, brown cow?
Cowboy.
So, I'll see you later?
- Yeah.
Hey, you guys playin'
Kick The Can tonight? - Huh?
Kick The Can. At ten o'clock in the old baseball field.
Before Jujyfruit's party.
- You're gonna be there, right?
Sure.
- Okay.
Let's evacuate, please.
Hey, don't forget our gig at the Buttcrack next Wednesday.
Who's opening? - Sandy Duncan's Eye and
Jayne Mansfield's Head.
Boge. I met the drummer for Sandy
Duncan's Eye at a party.
Reeks like a barnyard animal.
- So come late then 'n' just see us.
Hey, have you seen Bart around today?
Y'know, we were s'posed to rehearse this morning 'n' he like totally flaked again.
Barty boy. Haven't seen you in a golden age
Yeah I've been busy.
- Busy jonesin', y'mean.
Whatev
C'mon, Handjob, quit screwin' around.
Hey Bart. To whom do we owe the pleasure? - Hey Kriss, Kozy.
We were hoping you were here for an appointment.
Actually, me 'n' Handjob're just conductin' a bit-o-business.
- Oh bummer.
Isn't that a humongous bummer, Kriss?
Bart's here for my brand of bliss today, ladies.
I dunno what to do.
It's hard enough bein' in a band with your boyfriend, but when stuff like this starts happenin'!
Mean, what'm I s'posed to do?
Fire him?
Or break up at least.
OK, ladies
SCARF!
Hey so what's up with my video, man?
I'm still in the
'conceptualizing' stages.
Don't worry, it's gonna blow your testes off. - Yeah?
You 'n' Bart are like trapped inside this like gigantic, slimy uterus
Glug.
- Are you gonna?
I promised my mom I'd stop for a week.
You? - I'm just gonna do a bunch of speed later 'n' not eat for like three days.
Sorry Sorry.
Isn't that.
- OhmyGod.
Well, I guess I'd better go hunt for him.
Wait. Can you drop me at Aran's?
I wanna score the new Dead Puppies CD.
I'm sorry the door was unlocked 'n' I.
- Forget about it.
What's your name?
- Egg.
Well, I mean, my real name's Polly, but my friends all call me Egg.
'EGG'? - It's dweeby, I know, but it just kinda stuck.
Well, hi Egg.
- I'm...
I know who you are.
I'm not from another dimension.
He looks shorter in person.
- So what?
He's still the total definition of yummy.
OhmyGod, whatdidhesay?
Nothing really, he just. He invited me to go for a walk. - WHAT?
Hey, did y'hear what happened to Marcus?
His butthole fell out 'n' he has to have surgery.
Oh Henry.
Oona-eye.
Are we still in reality?
My palm itches.
Where's your twin brother Shad?
Death:
Cool.
Have I ever told you that I love you?
Stow it'n'pay the lady, Shad.
Watch out, breeders! - Watch out yourself, you freakin' lezbots!
Eat my Bermuda Triangle, Shad!
RACE!
You alright?
Kill.
Hey, look who it is
Hey Jana, isn't that your muff diving little sister over there with her disgusting
Bosco-flavored girlfriend?
Insert it in your clammy crevice, will you Shannon?
Hey, I think I need to pump again.
I could use a firm-up too.
Puke-ity.
- Kiss it and make it better.
So what're you gonna wear to Jujyfruit's party tonight?
Clothes.
Can I borrow your Human
Sexology notes from last Friday?
Am I, like, the only person on this cosmic plane who ever goes to class?
Hey, do you think
Montgomery likes me?
He's weird.
- Y'think?
Yo, Alyssa!
- Hey Ducky.
Hi, Ducky.
- I just woke up.
Really? - You guys hear
Muriel's in Cedar Sinai?
Who's Muriel?
- My stepmom.
She's like way anorexic: she passed out in her low-impact aerobics class 'nd they had to carry her out on a stretcher.
Oh, drag.
You guys gonna be at the
Kick The Can game later?
I am.
Later, tater-tots.
- Right.
Hi Elvis.
Where've you been?
- Places. Get on.
What does she see in that scuzball?
You smell like a wet dog.
Complainin'?
- Nope, rreeeorrrr.
Y'seen Egg around?
It's her turn to recycle the aluminum.
OhmyGod. You haven't heard? Your little sister just left here with you're not even gonna believe this.
Do you ever watch Baywatch?
D'you think this is completely freaky or what? - What?
Y'know. Hangin' out, with me, like this.
Well it's a little surreal, I guess.
You have no idea how sucky it is being like, a "celebrity".
Everybody treats you like you're not even a person anymore, like you're this thing, this entity.
You're eating dinner in some restaurant, or goin' to the movies or whatever, and people stare and point at you, start whisperin' to their friends like you're some exhibit at a freak show
Wow.
- That's why I like being with you.
I mean, I don't know you that well or anything, but you seem,
I dunno, different.
Neat.
- Thanks.
Do you wanna sit?
- Sure.
OhmyGod. Jujyfruit's party is tonight and I have no clue who to go with!
What about Jason?
- I'm going with Jason.
Well then, I'll go with Tomas.
I thought you were going with Tomas.
- Tomas has a dinky weenie.
You did Tomas?
- Ewww, I'm sure, gross.
I thought Jason was doing Tomas.
Jason is doing that Valley sluthole llene Schwarzkopf.
Untrue. Says who? - Ilene.
- And you believe her?
Hello, she lives in Whittier!
If Jason did llene, then he must've done Richard.
Who's Richard?
- Ilene's other scag.
Like she's totally into these kinko threeways.
Ilene is a whore.
Is Richard the surfer with the hairlip that drives a black Jetta?
No, he's got a Lexus.
- I thought he hung himself.
No, he's, like, totally gorgeous.
Plus he's got a Lexus.
Is he gay?
- Who? Jason?
Richard?
- Tomas.
Well, duh.
What do you think, dingleberry?
I swear, Trudi, you can be so...
Yeah, I wanna write and direct
I have to ensure that the artistic integrity of this project isn't compromised first thing Monday.
I ever-so-solemnly swear. 'K.
Ciao, J. F. Christ.
Hold on.
Coming.
Where is he?
Where is he?
He was here tike an hour or so ago but no, man, he's not here now.
See Barty boy has left the building.
- Where'd he go man?
Did he say where he was going?
- Heaven.
He said he was taking a hike up that or Stairway To Heaven.
Bye.
My hat.
Where's my hat.
So, are you in school?
Studying?
I dunno. Nothing.
Well I mean, a bunch of stuff, nothing specific
Well, just as long as you aren't in the Industry.
I have sworn off all actresses, models, d-girls, you-name-it.
Forever.
I have this fantasy.
It's probably cornball or romantic, I know but there's times when I want to just disappear.
Meet up with someone special, and just run away, never be heard from again.
Don't you think that'd be killer?
Me too.
I figured you'd be here.
Hey Dude. - Bart.
You promised me, man.
I'm sorry, Cowboy.
I'm really sorry.
You have got to get clean, man.
You've got to.
Or it's all over.
Okay?
You, me, the band, the whole falafel.
I will, Cowboy.
You know I will.
I mean it this time, Bart.
C'mere, come up here.
No, man.
Just get clean.
Look, I'll do anything to help you through it but we cannot do this anymore.
You get it?
No more.
I love you, dude.
Thirsty?
Dyin'.
So howyadoin', smiley?
OK now.
Mel. Dark.
I love you, Mel.
Totally true and pure Mutual.
1 just wish we didn't like get together with so many other people 'n' stuff
Palooka, you know that I firmly believe that human beings are built for sex and for love.
And that we should dole out as much of both as possible before we're old and ugly and nobody wants to touch us anymore.
I know
And just because I make it with other guys and girls has no effect whatsoever on my feelings for you.
Sometimes I feel so old-fashioned and from another planet.
It's like I'm half a person without you.
You are so cute.
Life is so complicated.
I wrote a poem for you last night.
Want me to read it to you?
- No.
Hey Elvis Do you believe in God?
I don't believe in anything.
You have to believe in something.
No I don't.
Tie me up.
OK, Mr. Kinky.
This OK?
- Tighter. Tighter!
Now the pants baby, the pants.
Okay now, spank me, baby.
Spank my hot, tight, rock-hard ass!
Harder! Harder! HARDER!

So That He Can Show You The Way
Into The True Kingdom of God!

D'you know Alonzo DeLosa?
That dude never shuts up.
Well, he shagged this chick he met at Jones a couple weeks ago, and last Wednesday, he woke up 'n' his pecker was covered in itchy, black, pus-oozing sores.

Guess I'll have to use the other John, 'scuze me.
So're you gonna get with
Surf 'n' Ski tonight?
I s'pose.
Mel, are we still together, or what?
Dark
I just wish things weren't so messed up 'n' confusing, that's all
Can't we just leave this place?
Can't we just leave this whole planet behind and forget about everybody 'n' everything and just like be in love 'n' stuff?
Oh Dark
Hello?
Put the drugs away and open up!
Dark, I Look, can't we just deal with this later?
Okay?
Okay?
I just really miss you, that's all.
Hello? L.A.P.D.
- Can you hold on a minute?
I gotta go pee.
Hey sis.
- What're you doing here?
Hangin.
- I need air.
Hey, Dark.
How's tricks?

Yeah, sure.
- Dad, slowdown, I.
Son I don't know how to
Dad?
What is it?
It's, it's your sister
What is what's wrong Dad
Hey Dark, have you seen Ducky?
He disappeared.
No.
I think I'm gonna bail.
- How come?
'Cuz this party's about as fun as an ingrown butt hair.
NOOOOOOOOOOO.
DUCKY!
Grab his arm.
One one-thousand, two one-thousand, three one-thousand one one-thousand Ducky?
Get me a towel.
EGG EGG
- Ducky!
How would you like to sit on my face 'n' cut a big, juicy fart?
Yo! Dark.
What's happenin', Handjob?
No poontang, that's for sure.
Pardon my french.
Hey, need anything?
Up, down, all around
Nah.
I'm blowin'.
It's been a gnarly day.
- Yeah?
In the last eighteen hours, I've seen four people get abducted by a space alien, watched Ducky try to drown himself, plus I spent like 387 bucks on CDs at Aran's. - Kick my mom.
Hey, what CD's'd you score?
Hey, punk. Remember me?
The one you sold the bad drugs to?
The one you ripped off?
- Elvis, baby, c'mon.
Where's my money.
Huh, punk?
I, got some stuff in the car killer stuff it's yours gratis.
- Elvis, DON'T!
Elvis, STOP IT!
C'mon! C'MON ASSHOLE! C'mon.
Come and get me.
Come on big man!
Oh my God Elvis, STOP IT!
Dear Diary What a day.
I swear I have never been so depressed and miserable and lonely in my entire life.
It's like I know there's got to be somebody out there somewhere, just one person in this huge, horrible, unhappy universe who can hold me in their arms 'n' tell me everything's gonna be OK.
But how long do I have to wait before that person shows up?
I feel like I'm sinking deeper and deeper into quicksand, watching everyone around me die a slow, agonizing death.
It's like we all know, way down in our souls, that our generation is gonna witness the End Of Everything.
You can see it in our eyes.
It's in mine.
Look.
I'm doomed.
I'm only eighteen years old and I'm totally doomed.
Wait.
Jesus!
Montgomery.
The weirdest thing just happened to me.
Well, are y'gonna just stand there with your mouth hangin' open, or are you gonna let me in?
Sorry.
Thanks.
So, like, what happened?
I got kidnapped by space aliens.
Really?
'N' then what?
Well, they did all these tests
'n' experiments 'n' stuff on me, then I overheard them talking about their plan to take over the earth.
Then I escaped.
No way.
- Way.
FookinA.
I feel strange.
I think I'm catchin' a cold or something.
- D'you wanna, um?
Is it OK if I just, uh, rest here for awhile?
I'm suddenly like soooooo tired.
- Sure.
Well, aren't you?
Gonna?
Yeah
I, hope you don't take this the wrong way.
I mean, I know you and
Mel are like, whatever.
"Whatever" is right.
She's all, you know.
It's not like I'm gay or anything and I know we kinda just met.
But I really like you a lot.
And I think about you.
Me too.
I mean, I feel the same about you
Like when I was trapped in the pod thing that the Aliens held me captive in, all I could think about was what if they kill me, and I never get to see you again?
This sounds retarded and pathetic I know, but all my life I've been searching for one special person on this awful, scary planet who I can love, who loves me for what I am.
That is so poetic.
Is it OK if I spend the night?
I really wanna sleep next to you.
Only if you promise to never, ever leave me.
Deal.
What's is something the matter?
Montgomery.
Montgomery, what is it?
Montgomery, Montgomery,
Montgomery. Tell me what it is.
Please!
MONTGOMERY-MONTGOMERY
Ohmygod, stop
MONTGOMERY
I'm outta here.

- l`ll pay for it. How much is it?[br]- $56,000.
56,000?[br]What are you smiIing about?
You need me, Dr EIIiot.
We`ve been cleared for take-off.
Please make sure[br]thatyour seatbelts are fastened.
- We`re returning her to the jungIe.[br]- Not a moment too soon.
- You`re the reason she`s upset.[br]- Me? What did I do?
- Ugly woman.[br]- Yes. Now Iet`s get your seat beIt on.
Forgive me. I`II expIain Iater.[br]See? I`m buckIing my seat beIt.
- We`re aII buckIing our seat beIts.[br]- You can do it.
That`s it.[br]Good girI. Here`s an egg.
- We do not throw things.[br]- Is she dangerous?
Humans are dangerous,[br]goriIIas are gentIe.
You think the goriIIa[br]may be dangerous? Maybe so.
Don`t perpetuate the King Kong myth,[br]the myth of the kiIIer ape.
- Are you sure some goriIIas don`t kiII?[br]- You can`t be serious.
What`s your area of expertise,[br]foIk singing?
- Communications technoIogy.[br]- A geek with a ceII phone.
I`m a scientist. But you[br]and your protege beIong in the circus.
Just because you came up with[br]a wad of cash ... It`s okay, Amy.
- Where ground?[br]- It`s fine. We`re fIying.
- We`re going to the jungIe.[br]- Amy wantgreen drop drink.
Amy wantgreen drop drink.
AII right.
You`d swear they were married.
The ``kiIIer ape`` is poIiticaIIy incorrect,[br]but that`s not to say it`s untrue.
- I can`t beIieve what I`m hearing.[br]- CIiches usuaIIy contain some truth.
- Are you serving that ape a martini?[br]- She`s aIIowed one. It`II caIm her down.
In my Iife I have heard[br]many a bizarre story -
- containing bizarre truth.
- I`m sorry I caIIed you ugIy. If I didn`t ...[br]- I know, it was for Amy`s benefit.
Can I ask you something?[br]Why teach an ape to taIk?.
Why teach anything to anyone? It[br]doesn`t make you rich or get you girIs.
Why did Prometheus steaI fire[br]onIy to give it away?.
One face of the inherent generosity[br]in the human spirit is the teacher.
I repeat, why teach an ape to taIk?.
- No practicaI reason.[br]- Then why did you do it?
``A IoneIy impuIse of deIight.``
- WiIIiam ButIer Yeats.[br]- Very good.
Did it work?.[br]You`re not IoneIy anymore?
Why are you going to Africa?
To find something I Iost.
- Watch your step.[br]- Dr Ross!
Eddie Ventro. Mr Travis asked me to[br]meet the pIane, set up your expedition.
- Hers? She`s just aIong for the ride.[br]- Whatever. Be an asshoIe.
- Who is this guy?.[br]- Ventro, transportation and equipment.
But I don`t suppIy asshoIes with new[br]personaIities. Let`s see your new pIane.
You want to seII that goriIIa?[br]It`s worth a Iot of money.
- How much? I`m just curious.[br]- 20-25 grand for a femaIe.
- Amy want to go home.[br]- I`m taking you home.
Whoa, a taIking goriIIa! I can feeI the[br]money hairs on the back of my neck.
Mr Travis toId me to Ioad you up.[br]You know how to use aII this stuff?
- Do you reaIIy need a baIIoon?[br]- No, Iet me see that.
- Who are they?.[br]- Hi, feIIas!
The fuck if I know. We`re on[br]our third government in two years.
- So you`re our guide?[br]- No, you`ve got Monroe KeIIy.
- Is he good?[br]- Very good, and very Iate.
Now what? Why do I feeI Iike[br]this airport`s just gone to shit?
- Give me your passports.[br]- Our guide is Robertson ReynoIds.
Yeah, I fired him.[br]Robertson ReynoIds is a bird-watcher.
The Kigani have had it with Zaire[br]and they`re eating peopIe.
You go in with ReynoIds, you come out[br]somebody`s boweI movement.
Wasn`t that easier than customs?
Monroe ...
We need to switch airports.[br]Bomb in the president`s car.
- It was his car?. Did they get him?[br]- That`s the bad news. No, they didn`t.
- I hope you foIks have Iots of money.[br]- We do.
Thank you. Now run away ...
Get in the back. Leave the equipment[br]to Eddie. I wouId hurry.
- Is this normaI?[br]- You`re on your own, Eddie.
- Where do you want me to set you up?[br]- Get a DC-3. The strip near Kegoma.
First the Kigani in Zaire, now this[br]godfather stuff. Not a good day.
- Lower the fIaps.[br]- Good Iuck!
I`m getting out of here.
- What`s going on?[br]- Are we safe?
It`s aII right, just a few bumps.
Amy, Ieave that man aIone.
Amy, don`t inhaIe.
Karen Ross? Monroe KeIIy.[br]I`m your great white hunter for this trip.
- Though I happen to be bIack.[br]- How bad is this news for us?
Whenever Ieadership comes into[br]question, they tend to murder everyone.
- Oh, my God![br]- They Iive to settIe scores.
And they`ve got a Iot of scores to settIe.[br]It`s Iike in the Congo.
Things are pretty bad in the Congo.[br]The Kigani are pissed off.
Can`t bIame them. The 22th century[br]sucks. Maybe the 21st wiII be better.
- Are you a criminaI?[br]- Aren`t we aII?
I`m not a criminaI, I`m a scientist.
I run a few guns, you sons of bitches[br]ruin the worId.
- We shouIdn`t be invoIved with them.[br]- What wouId you suggest?
As soon as we can,[br]we shouId go our own way.
Don`t I know you?
Perhaps. I traveI a great deaI.
- What are you doing with that goriIIa?[br]- Taking her back home to the Congo.
Taking her back to the farm[br]now that she`s seen Paree?
And this is your cover?.[br]Pretty good. Or, it wouId have been.
- I`m nobody`s cover.[br]- You find yourseIf in the middIe.
- Cover for what?[br]- I don`t know, and she won`t teII you.
But the money her company[br]is throwing around isn`t for a goriIIa.
ReIax. You`re in better hands[br]than you shouId be.
No one can go to Zaire.[br]The border is shut. There is a revoIt.
- It`s not my fauIt. Where`s my goriIIa?[br]- She`II be kept on the truck ...
- Isn`t this a hospitaI?[br]- This one`s decided to speak.
- This is pure Kafka.[br]- Who is Kafka? TeII me!
- Monroe.[br]- Captain Wanta.
How are you?[br]Miss Ross, such a pIeasure.
Have some coffee and cake.
Have some!
You have our visas. This is a scientific[br]mission. You have no right to detain us.
Liar, Iiar, pants on fire.
So says my computer, Miss Ross.
You used to work for the CIA.[br]Now you`re TraviCom.
- They pay better?.[br]- You have a big mouth.
Everybody says that about me.[br]What can I do?
- Monroe, you have terribIe timing.[br]- TeII me about it.
They bIew up the president`s Mercedes.[br]Our country wiII be in shit for a year.
- Captain, I need that truck.[br]- And ten good men to the border.
More.
Mr HomoIka?
Stop eating my sesame cake.
Stop eating my sesame cake!
What are you doing in my country,[br]you bag of shit?
Captain, pIease.[br]I onIy wish to expIore and discover.
This feIIow is a big bag of shit.
Shake this rat from off your neck.[br]He owes money to everybody.
I wiII ask you to wait outside.
I Iike that, Miss Ross. You surprise him.
So, I put this away.
Don`t want nobody peeking.
It`s the goriIIa that wiII get you[br]across the border safeIy.
Everyone`s afraid of being seen in an[br]American movie being crueI to goriIIas.
This is the crazy worId we Iive in.[br]Okay, you can go.
Hit the road, as they say.[br]And have a nice day.
Are you aII right?[br]Admit it, you`re gIad to see me.
- Kahega![br]- Monroe!
Kikuyu tribesman, very nice guy.
- Are we in Zaire?[br]- Tanzania.
Stay cIose to me.[br]Amy, come on.
- I think this is at my expense.[br]- You`re right.
- When wiII we get to the rainforest?[br]- Herkermer HomoIka, right?
You`re not Iooking for[br]SoIomon`s city again, are you?
Mr HomoIka was part of[br]a disastrous expedition five years ago.
They were Iooking for a city[br]caIIed Zinj, but it doesn`t exist.
- It does exist![br]- Three members died from exposure.
- A fourth was somehow shot.[br]- It was an appaIIing suicide.
Mr HomoIka had to be[br]carried out of the jungIe by me.
- I knew he wasn`t a phiIanthropist.[br]- He has done good, mostIy for himseIf.
- Shut up, you fiIthy ...[br]- FiIthy what?
Forgive me. AII that traveIIing[br]has Ieft me ... shaken.
Think nothing of it.[br]AII aboard!
- What`s aII this stuff?[br]- Courtesy of Eddie Ventro.
A customs guy hit me in the head with[br]a can of peanut oiI for stamping visas.
I`m never going back to that country.
You got everything but the baIIoon[br]and the home entertainment centre.
Your boss says ``CaII me``.
You have 1 1 good guys, significant[br]firepower and significant technoIogy.
Good Iuck.[br]Bye, Monroe.
- May I?[br]- There`s one thing I don`t understand.
- If the border`s shut, how do we cross?[br]- Luck.
- What`s going on?[br]- What the heII is that?
Shit. I thought we`d get farther.[br]I`d put her out now.
- Who`s firing on us?[br]- We`re vioIating Zaire`s airspace.
She Iikes bananas? Eat this, darIing.[br]She`s going to feeI great.
Something to keep her caIm.[br]GoriIIa Prozac.
- Can we make it to Bondo?[br]- We`re done.
- What are you doing?[br]- Step aside, pIease.
Miss Ross. Here.
- Why are they putting on parachutes?[br]- Figure it out.
- This won`t work.[br]- I`II take Amy.
- She might get hurt. I can`t risk it.[br]- You know how to fIy this pIane?
The piIot and co-piIot[br]are aIready gone.
Push me, pIease.
Harder, pIease.
You want me to push you too?
See you down there.
- Where`s Amy?.[br]- SIeeping. She woke up coming down.
- That Iady has some set of teeth.[br]- We have to caII this off.
- I`m not James Bond.[br]- I`II take care of you.
I don`t want you to take care of me.
I`m taking a safari[br]into the Virunga region of the Congo.
If you don`t want to go, go wherever.
But this is a dangerous pIace,[br]and peopIe die here very easiIy.
Now, excuse me.
Amy ..?[br]Amy ..?
Such an extraordinary animaI.
Those paintings. Do you think she was[br]drawing something from reaI Iife?
- I think she was drawing home.[br]- What about those ovaI shapes?
- Just a shape she Iikes.[br]- Perhaps.
- Video game?[br]- It gives Iatitude and Iongitude.
- More than that, from the Iook of it.[br]- WeII, it`s a gadget. It has features.
- You found someone or something?.[br]- A IittIe bit of both.
- Why did you quit the CIA?[br]- I never worked for the CIA.
Of course not.[br]But if you had, why wouId you quit?
Because they`re a IoveIess bunch[br]of sons of bitches, and I`m not.
GIad to hear it.
- Okay, here we go.[br]- FabuIous equipment.
- I have air-conditioning, too.[br]- Air-conditioners?
- I suppose it is a bit much.[br]- Shit, I`II take one.
Mr HomoIka ...
- PIease, caII me Herkermer.[br]- AII right. You can caII me Mr KeIIy.
- I wonder what she`s about.[br]- What do you mean?
What you`re after, I`ve got figured.[br]What she`s after, I don`t know.
I`II get you!
I`m heIping that young scientist[br]return his ward to the wiId.
He says the ape may be abIe to teII us[br]the thoughts of the wiId goriIIas.
You`re Iooking for King SoIomon`s[br]diamonds. The Iost city of Zinj.
- I`ve given it up.[br]- Never. The probIem is, it doesn`t exist.
SoIomon must have got his diamonds[br]from Cartier, Iike everybody eIse.
You Iike that, don`t you?
Time for Madam Amy`s vitamins.
This is Karen Ross. 81452.[br]That is KR81452.
Travis, do you read? Karen Ross,[br]81452. Houston, Travis, do you read?
I read and see you. CongratuIations[br]on crossing the border.
- l have a signalfrom the powerpack.[br]- Good. Find the Iaser, you find CharIes.
Let`s hope so.[br]Tomorrow we enter the rainforest.
Karen, l`ve had those images[br]ofthe creature analysed.
- What is it?[br]- lt`s something new, butgorilla-like.
- Are you sufficientIy armed?[br]- Yes.
The bad news is geo-thermaI.[br]You`ve got to hurry.
The region in the Virungas is bad.[br]The voIcanic activity -
- is breaking out ofthe graph. lt`ll blow.[br]Could be a week, could be sooner...
- Watch out![br]- No, dammit! Not again!
I`m terribIy sorry.
It`s destroyed.
It`s compIeteIy destroyed.
- What is that?[br]- FuII moon. CoIobus monkeys.
- That`s monkeys?[br]- Mating season.
When there`s a moon Iike that, every[br]monkey for 200 miIes thinks he`s EIvis.
It`s Amy`s medicaI suppIies.[br]They can`t get wet.
- Shit! Somebody heIp me.[br]- What is it?
- There`s a creature on my ... Look.[br]- That`s a Ieech.
- Take it off.[br]- It`s your Ieech, you take it off.
- Need some heIp?[br]- Here, burn it off with this.
This is disgusting.
Thank you for your compassion.
Here.
- Monroe ...[br]- Don`t indicate you see them.
Mizumu. The ghost tribe.[br]There are probabIy 20 of them.
- I onIy see two. Are they friendIy?.[br]- They`re sensitive. Forest peopIe.
- Why are they Iaughing?[br]- I toId them I was in charge.
- What`s so funny about that?[br]- I`m bIack. I shouId carry Iuggage.
He says there`s a dead white man[br]with a symboI on his cIothes.
Did they say he`s dead?
- What does `TC`` mean?[br]- TraviCom. The company I work for.
They have many IeveIs of ``dead``. You[br]aren`t dead tiII you`re compIeteIy dead.
They haven`t moved him.[br]They beIieve his souI has Ieft his body.
If they move him, his souI wiII be Iost.[br]They`re asking his souI to come back.
Where is the man?
It`s not him, it`s Bob DriscoII.[br]What happened?
Bob?
- Who is this man?[br]- He was on TraviCom`s Iast expedition.
- What happened to him?[br]- I don`t know.
Bob ..?
He`s dead.
- That region is uninhabited.[br]- WeII, something inhabits it.
We saw the camp destroyed. PeopIe[br]dead. A grey goriIIa or something.
Two men are missing. Jeffrey Weems[br]and CharIes Travis, my fiance.
- My formerfiance.[br]- We`d better get to him, then.
BeautifuI boats.[br]Money`s a wonderfuI thing.
- Give her the banana with the dope?[br]- Yes, he gave it to her.
I know. Shitty Peter.
Hey, what`s this?
All the leaves are brown[br]and the sky is grey l wentfor a walk[br]on a winter`s day l`d be safe and warm[br]ifl was in LA
California dreamin`[br]on such a winter`s day...
- What is this Zinj, Mr HomoIka?[br]- I don`t know what you`re taIking about.
It`s beIieved that King SoIomon had[br]a diamond mine in a city caIIed Zinj.
Diamonds?
I suppose there`s no point[br]in pIaying stupid.
We shaII arrive there together,[br]we shaII aII be rich.
That`s fine with me. But there`s no Zinj.
HaIf the safaris never made it back,[br]the other haIf came back with nothing.
Yes, but we have a trumping card[br]that they did not have.
- We do?[br]- We do. That goriIIa.
- She knows where it is.[br]- The goriIIa?
As a young man,[br]I found a book in Soviet Georgia.
It contained a detaiIed drawing[br]of the city of Zinj.
The drawing contained[br]a pecuIiar decoration.
An open eye.
Later, on safari, I found this.
It`s the same symboI.
Look at this.
The goriIIa drew this.
It is the same image. It is the open eye.
That goriIIa has seen the city of Zinj.
- And she wiII take us there![br]- Have you taken your medication?
Have your Iaugh, and I wiII have mine.
Shit ...
- What is it?[br]- The signaI stopped.
- Does that mean ..?[br]- It just means the signaI stopped.
I don`t know what it means.
No probIem.
Oh, my God!
- Shoot it![br]- Amy!
Head for shore!
- How is he?[br]- It`s just a big cut. I`II stitch it up.
- What`s that?[br]- A pIane.
Good Iuck to them. The Zaire Air Force[br]has got a piece of their ass.
Pitch camp. Tomorrow, Mt. Mukenko.
She`s excited. She was born somepIace[br]on the other side of this mountain.
Wow, it`s beautifuI.
Is this your vaIIey, Amy?.[br]It is, isn`t it?
That`s your home.
PrettyjungIe, that`s right.
- What`s she doing?[br]- Yearning for the pIace in her heart.
- The pIace in your heart, Herkermer.[br]- You may caII me Mr HomoIka.
Come on, Amy, Iet`s go.
- We`ve Iost two porters. Ran away.[br]- And they didn`t invite me?
You want your gIove?[br]AII right, sit stiII.
This is a fork in the road.[br]We can go Ieft or right.
- The wrong way Ioses us a few days.[br]- We must foIIow the goriIIa.
- That wouId be Ieft.[br]- My Iast coordinates Iead this way.
- That wouId be right.[br]- Amy, Peter, go this way.
WeII, I don`t have her passion.[br]I`II foIIow the goriIIa.
This doesn`t seem[br]Iike the right way to me.
Good Lord.
- It`s that pIane we saw burning.[br]- Who were they?.
Travis must have sent[br]another expedition.
Looks Iike a rocket got them.[br]There`s no point going in there.
- My God, what a waste of Iife.[br]- We`d better keep moving.
- Don`t move. If you run ...[br]- He`II chase me. I read the books.
- You did good.[br]- Where did you go?
I ran away. Sorry.
- He Iooked right into my eyes.[br]- He`s a siIverback.
I never thought you couId just[br]waIk aIong and see them.
Amy.
Hello. l`m Amy.[br]Good, good, good. Amy.
Let`s take this off.
- She doesn`t reaIIy beIong anywhere.[br]- No, she beIongs here.
- What the heII is that?[br]- Perimeter aIarm around their camp.
But where`s the camp,[br]and their equipment?
I don`t understand it. There had to be[br]300 pounds of equipment.
And there`s no sign of the bodies.
- It`s a dead end?[br]- Maybe, maybe not.
Bingo!
- Son of a bitch![br]- What is this?
It is the city of Zinj ...
... that I have Iooked for aII my Iife.
See, the eyes.
It is the same.
Kahega, guns up. Stay aIert.
Come here, Amy. Stay with me.
First they found the diamonds,[br]SoIomon`s men.
A diamond mine of incredibIe bounty.
Then they buiIt the city around[br]the mine, so that it shouId be protected.
The savagery of the guards[br]was Iegendary.
They instantIy feII upon[br]any thief, any transgressor.
The diamonds fIowed[br]to the kingdom of SoIomon.
- Why did the city die?[br]- Maybe the mines ran dry.
No, the diamonds are here!
- Monroe, over here![br]- What is it?
I found this.
Don`t go in there. I`II go. Don`t be[br]so John Wayne, you couId get kiIIed.
I`m not going in there aIone, either.
- I must go.[br]- I`II just stay out here with Amy.
Not aIone you won`t. Kahega!
Stay cIose together.[br]HomoIka ...
The same hierogIyphics, over and over.
What do they mean?
Amy, don`t wander off!
- Do you speak EngIish?[br]- Yes.
- What`s your name?[br]- CIaude.
That`s an unusuaI name for[br]somebody from ... Where are you from?
- Mombasa.[br]- It`s an unusuaI name for Mombasa.
- Have you ever been to Mombasa?[br]- No.
Then what do you know about it?
I want to go home.
Amy?.[br]Amy, come here.
Where are you, girI?[br]Come on, I`m not fooIing around.
Amy ...
Come here, girI.
CharIes!
CharIie!
- What are those hoIes?[br]- Lava tubes. It fIows through here.
This must Iead to the mine.
Bring a Iight.
Here.
Now here. Come on.
Up here.[br]No ..!
- That`s not going anywhere.[br]- Where can they be? What happened?
- Let`s get out of here whiIe we stiII can.[br]- Help me!
- What`s that?[br]- Richard!
HeIp me! HeIp me!
- Richard![br]- Let me go! Let me go!
Oh, my God! Something ...
- Richard ...[br]- No, Iet`s get out of here.
It`s okay.
They`re some kind of goriIIas.
I never saw an animaI move Iike that.[br]Theyjust kiII.
That`s why the diamonds were never[br]found. The kiIIer ape myth is true.
Bad gorillas.
Let me turn your voIume down.
Here`s your Iovey.
- It`s okay.[br]- Mother. Mother.
Yes, you`re okay now.
- See anything?[br]- No, but I`m the Iast Iine of defence.
Sensor-operated machine pistoIs are[br]set up, if anything comes within 40 ft.
You reaIIy know how to pack.
- I don`t see anything.[br]- Put that out.
They`re testing their perimeter.
- Are they inteIIigent?[br]- Yes, but they shouIdn`t be aggressive.
They`re too damn smart. They`re[br]out there, but what are they doing?
Monroe!
Get down!
- They`re gone.[br]- We`re out of here at first Iight.
I have transIated those hierogIyphics[br]we saw inscribed everywhere.
- What do they say?.[br]- `We are watching you.``
Where are the bodies?
- Have you seen Amy?. She`s gone.[br]- AIong with two porters and HomoIka.
- I`m going to find her.[br]- PeopIe come first, then goriIIas.
We`II retrieve our comrades, then we`II[br]retrieve your missing goriIIa. Mount up!
Peter, take this.[br]I don`t care if you don`t Iike guns.
- Here it is. They domesticated goriIIas.[br]- Domesticated? They`re kiIIing a man.
They bred them to vioIence. They[br]Iooked for the trait and encouraged it.
Guard dogs[br]who turned on their masters.
What`s that smeII?
These are the bones of goriIIas.[br]Of normaI goriIIas.
- This one`s skuII was crushed.[br]- FeeI that?
- Everybody okay?.[br]- Yeah, Iet`s go.
Don`t go this way. It`s aII caved in.
- I was trying to find the mines ...[br]- Be quiet. Got any fIares, Kahega?
- What`s making my eyes burn?[br]- SuIphur fumes.
- What the heII ...[br]- It`s the mines!
`We are watching you.`` It`s the trainers[br]taIking. The teacher is watching you.
Dead teachers.
Look.
Yes, yes, yes. I knew it was true!
The city of Zinj, the diamonds ...
Every word of it was absoIuteIy true.
I`d Ieave those aIone.
- Any other way out of here?[br]- Not that I`ve noticed.
HeIp me. FiII up everything.
- You`ve got to get me out of here![br]- Take a number.
- But we`re going to be rich![br]- Is that a way out?
- Let`s go.[br]- Stay cIose together.
- What is it?[br]- It`s a geode. A giant diamond.
- They cut him off. Kahega![br]- Check if there`s a way out back there.
Jeffrey ...
CharIie!
- It`s him?[br]- It`s him.
Come on.
- Is there a way out back there?[br]- No, nothing.
- We`re aImost out of rounds.[br]- Buy me two minutes.
Ugly gorillas. Go away.
They don`t know what to make of it.
- Amy.[br]- Mother. Mother.
- Peterhug Amy.[br]- MaternaI instinct, Iong may she reign.
- What are you doing?[br]- We`re getting out of here.
They`re going on[br]the endangered species Iist.
Come on, Monroe. Move!
- What the heII is that?[br]- The Iatest thing in communication.
Come on.
Go, Amy!
Keep going!
- Where are they?.[br]- I don`t know.
Hang on!
Watch out!
- Go, Amy![br]- Hurry!
- Amy, come on![br]- You can do it!
- Keep moving.[br]- Head for higher ground.
Get the yeIIow case from that pIane.[br]It`s a baIIoon. I`II get the transmitter.
Amy!
- How cIose is the border?.[br]- Not far.
KR 81452.[br]Houston, Travis, do you read?
KR 81452.[br]Houston, Travis, do you read?
KR 81452.[br]Houston, Travis, do you read?
Karen, I thought I`d Iost you.[br]I sent another expedition.
- Did you getit?[br]- I have bad news. CharIes was kiIIed.
Did you get the diamond?[br]Did you?
- Yes.[br]- Good girI.
Do you remember I said[br]that if you sent me here -
- for some diamond,[br]and not for CharIie, I`d make you sorry?.
Karen, ofcourse l`m upset.
- But what`s done is done. l could ...[br]- I know. You need a new cash machine.
What`ll happen to the satellite iflput[br]its phone numberin the laser and fiire?
The transmitter chip[br]has the sateIIite`s number. lt`s a 12,000 channel chip. lfyou[br]putit through the diamond ... Karen!
This is for you, CharIie.
Amy!
There you are.
Amy, you saved me.
It`s okay.
Thank you.
I Iove you, too.
Mother?.
Oh, I see.[br]It`s Africa. It`s your mother.
Amy, where did you go?
Good goriIIas?[br]What good goriIIas?
Handsome feIIa.
Amy ...
- Look at that.[br]- Is that Amy with the ...
The siIverback. So she`s ...
I see. I see.
She`s home.
- WiII she be aII right?[br]- They know what to do.
- We`ve got to go.[br]- Bye, Amy.
Peter, wouId you do me a favour?.[br]Throw this away for me.
You sure?
Ouch.
- There`s a wind.[br]- I hope it bIows us somepIace good.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry?
Sir, she's breaking out!
What are we looking for?
She jumped over the fence!
A couple of trains came through here about the time she escaped.
Do you think she could have gotten this far in that time?
Is she that fast?
She is that fast.
And this too.
- Three dollars and ten cents?
- Your change.
- Thank you.
Can I help you?
The total is $ 17.95.
Here's your card.
Are you gonna buy those?
Have a nice trip.
It's brown tweed bag, like a duffel.
Do you see it anywhere?
- Sir, it's not here.
- The porter said he put it on the cart.
This is the cart.
There's no bag here.
Government authorities said it was the largest earthquake to strike...
He's riding Greased Lightning.
That was Shorty Kincaid.
Enjoy the view.
Excuse me.
We shouldn't be seen together.
Father hasn't been dead long.
Do you think Arlen suspects?
No. It's not too soon for us to be together.
Tickets.
Are you traveling by yourself?
You're 12?
Someone meeting you in Los Angeles?
We'll say you're 11.
Then you only pay half price.
Our little girl did this?
She's not a little girl.
DNA typing and material found in those wounds proves it was her.
She could be anywhere. Chicago,
Las Vegas, Los Angeles, anywhere.
We should stop the trains.
And have the railroad and police ask questions we can't answer?
We'll put key personnel at every stop along these lines.
I want a team to track her.
Hunt her down.
- Good morning, Jill.
- Hello.
- Thanks for taking care of my cat.
- We'll take good care of him.
I won't be gone very long.
Take care.
Bye-bye.
Are you still having problems with the people at work?
They point their finger at me saying...
...I'm the weird one,
I'm the strange one.
Why? Because I have feelings?
Because I feel?
There's someone at the door.
I won't answer that. Whoever it is can come back at the end of the hour.
That's for me.
Sorry to interrupt.
We need your help, Dan.
I know.
Gotta go.
Mr. Fitch will be with you all in just a moment.
Well...
I guess we all must be here for the same reason...
...whatever that is.
I'm Dan Smithson...
...and I don't know why
I'm here either.
But they said they needed me and it was important, so I came.
What do you do, Dan?
I'm an empath.
Sometimes they show me awful things people have done.
I try to tell them why they did it.
What qualifies you for that?
I feel things deeply, that's all.
What am I feeling now?
You wanna believe that nothing affects you...
...that you're not afraid of anything.
But you're curious...
...just like the rest of us.
Stephen Arden.
Harvard Anthropology Department.
Expert at cross-cultural behavior.
Laura Baker. Hi. Molecular biologist.
And who are you, and what do you do?
Preston Lennox.
And if I'm here...
...the shit has hit the fan.
What exactly is your area of specialty, Mr. Lennox?
I'm a freelance solution to our government's problems.
What exactly might they be?
The kind people don't usually like to talk about.
You hunt people, don't you?
I guess so.
You in here? It's a little late for Tv.
You in here, honey?
Good evening, I'm Xavier Fitch.
I'm in charge of this operation.
Would you sit a little closer, please?
In November of 1974...
...a small group from S.E.T. I...
...S- E-T-I, Search for
Extraterrestrial Intelligence...
...used radio dishes at Arecibo...
...to send a message to whoever was listening.
They sent a quarter of a kilobyte...
...including structure of human DNA...
...a map of our solar system...
...population of the Earth.
Helpful facts like that.
In January of 1993, Arecibo received a message back...
...from an extra terrestrial...
...unknown source.
That's great.
Intelligent life beyond this planet?
Yes.
There were two communications.
The first message turned out to be a superior catalyst for methane.
We now have the potential...
...to produce infinite energy from this clean-burning fuel.
This convinced us we were dealing with a friendly intelligence.
The second message turned out to be a new sequence of DNA...
...with friendly instructions on how to combine it with ours.
Here's some technical data.
Get feedback from Dr. Baker.
Basically...
...the new combined
DNA sequence...
...was injected into 100...
...human ova.
We got 7...
...to divide.
Four petered out.
Two were stored in liquid nitrogen.
And we allowed one to grow.
Its code name is "Sil."
That's after 2 hours.
One day.
Two days.
- My God.
- This growth is amazing.
A week.
- It's a girl.
- Yes.
We decided to make it female so it would be more docile...
...and controllable.
- More docile and controllable, huh?
Well, I guess you guys don't get out much.
That's her 1 month after she was born.
So you kept her caged in there?
It was safer to keep her isolated.
She didn't like being locked up.
She didn't like being alone.
Didn't she?
She's hiding something.
Something inside.
You're right, Dan.
This is three months after she was born. Watch carefully.
What the hell was that?
Back the tape up.
Watch her eyes.
Rapid eye movement.
She's dreaming.
- She's having horrible nightmares.
- It's some kind of anxiety reaction.
Got me a little anxious.
It made the research team a little anxious too...
...so the decision was made to terminate the experiment...
...to run more research to see what we were dealing with.
You were going to gas her?
That was the decision.
It makes you feel mad.
You feel mad that you had to kill her, don't you?
I don't know.
Yes.
Yesterday the body of a transient was found in a boxcar near Salt Lake City.
Preliminary DNA tests conclude...
...he was killed by our creation, by our Sil.
Found any other bodies?
- Not yet.
- You will.
She's a predator.
Her eyes are in front...
...so she can judge the distance to her prey.
That's right.
Where'd you learn that?
I saw it on the Discovery Channel.
I caught that show myself.
- Mr. Lennox.
- Yeah?
As the...
...non-scientist amongst us, are you clear about what's going on?
I think so.
You created a monster...
...with a formula you got from outer space.
The damn thing got away. Now you want us to hunt it down and kill it.
Now, is that pretty close?
I guess.
You don't want us...
...to capture her alive so that we can study her?
Laura, I think this is strictly a search and destroy operation.
Nobody ever asked me to find anything they didn't want dead.
I'm sorry for you.
Yeah, well...
Thank you, Dan.
I'm sorry for her.
May I have your attention, please?
Welcome to Los Angeles. This is the terminal stop for the Desert Star.
All passengers please disembark.
Something bad happened here.
- No shit.
- Crushed her larynx.
She was afraid.
She's scared, frightened.
Hungry too.
She's been eating like a horse.
Our girl is definitely not on a diet.
She's storing calories for something.
Any ideas?
Oh, my...
Well, that's...
That looks like some sort of...
...chrysalis. Some kind of cocoon.
What are we looking for, a giant moth?
If that is a cocoon...
...she'll be fully-grown now.
- Fully-grown.
Maybe that's how she got by our people.
They were looking for a child.
She is a child.
It stinks in here. I'm going outside.
Get the conductors' ID and credit card numbers on your computer.
There's no sign of them on the train.
- Let's assume she took them.
- I'll see to that.
She kills if she's threatened.
And she has no remorse about it.
None.
Of course, Los Angeles is perfect for her.
It's a city of the future.
Anything goes.
Totally mobile population.
Everyone's a stranger.
Very little is taboo or unacceptable.
Whatever she does, no one will notice her.
Well, whatever. So...
Los Angeles is where the battle will be fought...
...and won.
You look very pretty.
Do you have a hundred?
Here we are.
Be more careful with your money.
Not everybody's as honest as me.
Are you foreign?
Do you speak English?
- Yes.
- Here. You keep this.
Here, let me take this.
Be careful here.
Yes.
Watch your step.
Our laboratory, Visitor Base One...
...is being moved to some empty virus research labs at the university.
They're moving our equipment now.
It'll be operational by 8:00.
Check into your rooms. Everyone out front in 15 minutes. We'll go over.
What will we do?
Process the evidence from the train.
Could we try growing this creature with its own DNA?
We do a version without ours this time and investigate its vulnerabilities.
That'd be good.
- Then I could know how it feels.
- Makes sense.
This human life form could be a mask.
Without the camouflage...
You're right. At least we'd know what we were dealing with.
A couple of bozos just ran out.
I got a customer.
- Yes, young lady. Can I help you?
- I want a room.
62, including tax. That'll just about cover the Honeymoon Suite.
Hi. Come here often?
What's your sign?
Tired of brunette?
Change.
Change the color of your hair.
Color-Tress.
I've increased the magnification.
When I pierce the cell, the foreign DNA will be introduced.
Shit!
The camera's gone down.
Excuse me.
Do you have a replacement camera?
We do, but it'll take time for the technician to replace it.
No. This happens in my lab all the time. It's simple to replace it.
You saying you can do it?
Sure I can. I just need somebody to give me a hand.
I don't want technicians in there.
This is classified.
I'll do it.
I'll do it.
- Man of action, I like that.
- That's me.
Can you get that one for me?
Give me the camera.
Something's... Something's wrong.
Christ, It's started already.
- It's started. Get the top back on.
- What?
Laura, Press, get the top back on.
Here you go.
She must have penetrated the cell.
- Shit.
- What was that?
He dropped the bolt.
- Find the bolt. Get the top on.
- I'm looking, Fitch.
Can they hear me in there?
Laura, Press...
...get the top on, then I'll let you out.
- Where'd it go?
- It fell through the grate.
- Can you lift it up?
- It's not gonna move.
- This isn't going anywhere.
- No, can't get it!
- Press...
...you gotta get the bolt!
- Can't get it. The floor's welded down.
- Oh, my God.
Press. Oh, my God.
- I've never seen anything like this.
- Holy shit.
I can't let them out.
- Press, look.
- Come on.
Fitch, let us out of here!
Open the goddamn door!
- Not until I know what's in there!
- Open it now!
- Let them out.
- I can't!
- Open up the fucking door!
- Let us out!
- Tell me it'll stop growing, Dan.
- It's not, let them out!
Open up the door!
Press, Press.
What the fuck is that?!
Laura, get to the other door!
- Let her out, Fitch!
- I can't!
- Let her out!
- I can't!
- You motherfucker!
- Let her out!
- You've gotta let them out!
- I can't hold it in!
Get out of the way!
I'm gonna burn it!
Out of the way!
- What is this thing?
- In 2 minutes, I'm burning the room!
I have to do it!
You have two minutes to kill it.
Disconnect the gas line.
Use it as a flamethrower.
Laura, watch out!
- Where'd it go?
- In the pipes!
- Open the door!
- Shut up, Dan!
One minute remaining.
Laura...
...it stopped moving. I think I killed it.
It's dead! Open the door!
It's dead, Fitch. Let them out.
Oh, God, it's not dead.
- Shit.
- What'll we do?
30 seconds remaining.
- There's not much time. Let's go.
- Open the door!
- Let them out.
- I can't do that.
- I have to follow protocol!
- What protocol?!
The protocols by which we're doing this!
You didn't tell them that before they went in.
- Fitch, let them out.
- Twelve, 11, 10...
- Fitch, let them out!
- I must follow protocol.
Let them out, Fitch!
Go. Get out of there!
Three, two, one.
- I had no choice.
- Yeah, sure.
The protocol is to burn the room if anything went wrong!
Where's a good place to find a man?
There's plenty of guys at the Id around the corner. It's a club.
You won't have trouble meeting somebody there.
Thank you.
You can't miss it.
Look for the long line.
I need your credit card...
...for room incidentals, long distance calls and so forth.
Credit card? Zip zap?
American Express, Visa,
MasterCard?
There you go. Thanks. All right.
Thank you.
Wait a minute!
You don't want this falling into the wrong hands.
No.
Here's Justin Crawl. It's through and it's covered by the goalie.
Yeah?
The conductor's credit card turned up...
...in a Hollywood motel.
The van's out front.
Let's go.
You two.
Enjoy yourselves.
You, legs. You're in. Go on.
Where are you from?
- I'm foreign.
- You're what?
- I'm foreign.
- Really?
Easy, easy.
I've got a party to go to and no one to take me.
I'll take you.
- You will?
- Yeah.
Okay. I'm going to the little girls' room.
Wait right here.
I'll be right back.
I'll be right here.
Whatever it takes, right?
All's fair in love and war.
Can't see much on that.
Get this tape to the lab. Enhance it.
See if we can get a better look.
She looks nice.
Do you have any idea where she went?
- I'll find her.
- She wanted to meet a man.
I suggested a club called the Id around the corner.
Get the tape.
I've got a party to go to and no one to take me.
Where is this party?
I don't know.
Whoa, you can't park there!
Back that out!
- No, you can't go in there.
- What's going on?!
- There's been a murder!
- No one leaves here! I mean, nobody!
There's always some action in this part of town.
Blue-eyed blonde.
Black leggings, pink sweater, 5' 10" tall. Who'd she leave with?
Blonde leaves with a guy is hardly news around here.
Name the top attractions. No losers.
Assume he's socially adept.
He'll be helping her out.
A friendly guy, not an asshole.
I'm thinking.
- Robbie left with a blonde.
- That's him.
That's him.
Come on. Let me show you the rest of the house.
I'm still sweaty from that place.
It's so crowded.
Like it?
Yes.
I feel like a shower.
You want one?
Tell you what.
I'm taking one.
You wanna take one later...
...no problem.
Take off your clothes.
I want to see you.
Very nice.
Take me back.
What are you talking about?
You know why we came here.
I've changed my mind.
All right. You said "no."
It's duly noted. Come here.
I wanna go!
Too late. You're not leaving!
You're not!
- All right.
- That's better.
What's happening? Kills a girl at the club, kills this guy.
I'd say she fits the definition of a psychopath.
Nothing inhibits her.
No moral sense, no social structure.
She wasn't exactly smothered with a mother's love or taught good manners.
I asked what was happening.
He did something, she was angry.
She'll kill if she's threatened or if anyone gets in her way.
Of what?
Her life cycle.
I think she's trying to mate.
Reproduce.
Okay.
So why did she kill the girl?
Sexual competition.
She's hard on the competition.
Now she managed to mate.
Doesn't look like a success.
He's still got his pants on.
- She's frustrated.
- Who isn't?
What's her problem?
She was here with him.
Maybe she rejected him.
She probably has special senses.
Rats can sense diseased or genetic damage in their potential mates...
...so we can test his body...
...for hereditary diseases or defects that would make him a loser...
...essentially.
Needles.
Maybe he was a doper, or a diabetic.
Either way would make him unacceptable. Excuse me.
All right.
Insulin. Diabetic.
There you have it.
She could have just walked out.
Why kill him?
He pissed her off.
Some men, when rejected, get insistent.
- Put an APB out on his car.
- We have.
We'll go back to the motel.
I want to check it out.
More docile and controllable, huh, Fitch?
- What do you think, Dan?
- What do I think?
I think she'd want to be alone now.
She won't come here with all these cars outside.
You're assuming she could find her way back here.
She could.
What is it?
Maybe menstrual blood.
If she's menstruating, she can reproduce.
Yes, I know.
Shit.
Oh, Jesus.
Excuse me.
Call a paramedic! Anybody got a phone?
If your commute takes you westbound on the 10 freeway...
...expect an hour delay.
The drive will be slow to Malibu.
The video enhancement is not that great.
How old do you think she is?
Twenty, 23?
Her reproductive system should be fully developed.
Her biological clock must be in hyperdrive.
She wants a baby.
If she has a child our problems have just begun.
If her offspring is male and develops at the same rate as Sil...
...it could reproduce in 6 months.
God knows how many females it could impregnate.
Fitch.
When a predatory species is introduced...
...into a closed ecological system...
...the extinction of the weaker species is inevitable.
They found the murdered guy's BMW, out of gas in Santa Monica.
What's her name?
- I don't know.
- Who are you?
She didn't have any ID.
I thought I'd make sure she was okay.
You think she's got insurance?
I don't know. Just put it on my credit card for now.
And you don't know her name.
Guys like you are hard to find.
Get a lab workup on that, stat.
Get her up to x-ray.
I want an x-ray on this.
It looks like a scapula fracture.
Your shoulder wound.
What's going on here?
Doctor, we need you now.
A child burn victim just came in.
- What is going on here?
- Doctor, please.
Jesus Christ!
Did you see her shoulder?
Please. We need you immediately.
You're okay.
I'm okay.
I was sure you were seriously injured.
I'm okay.
You are. It's a miracle.
Can we go?
Did the doctor say you could go?
Yes.
We'll send somebody over there.
Thanks a lot.
Doctor over at Parkbay Hospital called in with some weird story.
We should check it out.
It's a few miles away.
Laura...
...Press, take a car, check it out.
- Parkbay Hospital?
- Yeah, Parkbay.
She walked.
She walked.
She walked that way...
...not too long ago.
Got some fruit and cheese.
What is that?
You mean the hot tub?
A hot tub.
I love this place.
It's away from the traffic and business and people.
Sometimes it feels like you're not in L.A. Anymore.
Here.
We'll immortalize the moment.
Look at the camera.
- This girl literally reformed her bones.
- It's her.
Who checked her in?
I don't know. Let's find out.
She had no insurance so this guy put it on his own credit card.
Here's the file. John F. Carey.
You don't have a driver's license or home address?
No, sir.
Just an imprint of his credit card.
Give us a printout of what you've got.
No problem.
Some candy?
It's in the Palisades and he's got a phone number.
Tell Fitch where we're headed, and try to get John Carey on the line.
I'd better get the phone.
I've got his machine.
Should I leave a message?
Yeah.
Tell him he's about to copulate with a creature from outer space.
- Copulate, huh?
- Yeah.
I like you.
I know.
It's not too soon for us to be together.
No, it's not too soon.
You don't need these.
Hey, hey. That's a little fast.
What's the matter?
Take it easy.
Just relax.
There's plenty of time.
What is it?
I think someone's at the door.
Don't go.
Please. I want a baby.
What?! Excuse me?
Let's go around the side.
Outside.
- What happened?
- A squirrel! A fucking squirrel!
- She was here.
- Yeah, she was.
I wanna make sure she's not still here.
Perhaps we should check the body for evidence that they've had sex.
I used to be scared at the sight of blood.
Now I guess I'm getting used to it.
Oh, yes.
- Help me, please!
- Oh, my God. What's the matter?
We found this in the living room.
She liked him.
Well, not enough.
Can't see any more on that than we did on the video monitor.
He didn't get a good picture of her.
There's no evidence of semen in the hot tub water.
Maybe she took it with.
So she probably hasn't managed to mate.
- We interrupted her.
- Yes, I think we did.
Give me something I can use.
What have you come up with lately, Fitch?
She's not scared of us.
That's for sure.
We're all beat.
We'll go back to the hotel and rest.
Tomorrow night...
...we'll go back to the club.
- Stake it out.
- Stake it out.
She's not stupid.
She won't repeat herself.
There's no point going there.
It provided a poor specimen.
I'm not sure.
She's been in the city two days.
It's what she knows.
I'd rather try the club...
...than sit at the command center reminiscing about how close we got.
She would make one excellent biological weapon.
If someone thought we were some kind of galactic weed that would...
...spread through the universe.
So what you're saying is that...
...she's the cure and we're the disease.
That's well said.
"Baker, Laura.
1735 Meander Drive,
Simi v alley, california."
That's you, right?
Last time I checked.
What do you do for kicks out there?
Pine for guys like you.
That's what I thought.
So anyone hungry?
No, thanks. I'm beat.
I'm gonna try to get some sleep.
- Good night.
- Yeah. Night.
- I'll have something to eat with you.
- Thanks, Dan.
- Do you ever have nightmares?
- Yes.
Please untie my hands.
- I wouldn't hurt you. Please.
- I have them.
I think they tell me who I am.
Why are you doing this to me?
I don't know why I'm here.
I don't know who I am, who sent me.
- Do you?
- No!
- Why do you think you're here?
- I don't know.
Please let me go.
Please. Please, let me go.
I wouldn't hurt you.
I promise.
- I wouldn't hurt you.
- Yes, you would.
You just don't know it yet.
No, I wouldn't!
Please!
My hands are hurting me.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God, no!
No! No!
Laura and Press, they like each other.
They just don't like to show how they feel.
What?
Laura and Press, they like each other.
Yeah, whatever you say, Dan.
Look, it's really smoky in here.
I'm gonna go outside, get some air.
Think I'll lie down in the van. Have a rest. This is a complete waste of time.
Get a feeling you're on a wild goose chase?
Yeah.
Excuse me.
Get out of here. This is my trashcan.
It's you.
Hey!
She's here! Hey!
- Dan. Is that her?
- Yeah.
Here.
Get in the van.
Everybody get in the van!
They're heading into the hills.
We'll need the helicopters.
We're going up Nichols canyon. One of you try to block her at Mulholland.
Watch it!
Oh, my God!
We blocked the road.
We've gotta tell the press something.
Tell them what you want, just don't tell them the truth.
I don't buy her showing up at the club. It's too damn convenient.
Seeing is believing or don't you trust your eyes?
Get back! Get all these people back!
Fitch. Fitch. It doesn't feel right.
Sir!
We found a severed thumb in one of the doors that got ripped off.
- Let me see that.
- She may have caught it in the door.
Get to the lab, see if it's hers.
- It'll be genetically identifiable.
- It's all over, everyone.
Tomorrow you can go back to your lives.
Congratulations on a job well done.
Just like that, huh, Fitch?
I don't think so.
Leave me a message.
And Frank, I'm going to dinner.
Where are we meeting?
Bye, sweetie.
Waiter.
Well, I guess we won.
- We won, science lost.
- I didn't think we'd get her this way.
- Not that easy.
- You sound like you'll miss her.
I guess I will.
I think I respected her.
I know this was a hellish job, but I really enjoyed working with you three.
And since Uncle Sam is buying, let's have another round.
Waiter!
I don't... I don't drink.
Don't worry, Dan. Tonight you will.
You wanna dance?
- Who, me?
- Yeah, you.
- All right.
- Okay.
I know you don't have a family.
Do you have a girlfriend in New York?
I guess I've had a few, but they don't hang around very long.
I guess I keep too many secrets.
You wanna share one with me?
- Right now?
- Yeah.
I know what you do, and it doesn't scare me.
- Really?
- No.
Well, it does most people.
I wouldn't wanna never see you again.
- Hey.
- What are you...?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I thought you were somebody else.
I'm sorry.
You okay?
I thought it was Sil.
I saw the blonde hair.
She's dead, Press.
The tests on the thumb proved it was her.
You got your test and I got my gut.
I just don't buy it.
I think as long as you feel she's out there, you got a mission.
Maybe you don't want this job to be over.
Well, maybe not. So what?
Thanks for the dance.
Good night.
What do you call this?
It's called a Long Island Ice Tea.
It's got tea in it?
Nope.
Smells nice, can I try some?
Help yourself.
Does it work on your boyfriend?
Yeah. As a repellent.
I don't know. I think he's in remarkably good shape for a man his age.
One Long Island Ice Tea.
I like these cups of tea.
- What?
- That's great.
Hey, give me one of those.
I like these cups of tea, man.
You guys, I'm tired.
I'm gonna go to bed.
So?
She's going to bed.
I guess.
She still...
...wants to see you though.
Maybe I'll go find out if you're right about that.
I'd hate to be in here during an earthquake.
Yeah.
What floor do you want?
Ten, please.
I like your perfume.
You do?
- Thank you.
- Excuse me. I get out here.
Good night.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Did you want something?
- Maybe.
- Maybe?
Housekeeping.
Dan. Dan.
Those two over there.
Bet they like unusual men like us.
Women think I'm strange.
I don't feel well.
Don't be silly.
Just go over there and talk to them.
I have to go. And I think you should leave with me, okay?
I'm gonna stay for a while, actually.
Okay.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Housekeeping.
- Hi.
- Hi.
I was sitting over there, wondering...
...what two intelligent, glamorous women were doing without dates.
My name's Stephen Arden.
I teach anthropology at Harvard.
- I lived in Boston once.
- Yeah?
For a year.
- Froze my butt off.
- It's cold in Boston.
This is Bill and Tony.
I forget your name.
Cute little socks.
Stand up.
How'd you get in here?
- I stole the key.
- What?
I saw you downstairs, but you were with all those people.
So I thought I'd come up and wait.
This kind of thing doesn't usually happen to me.
I just want to be with you.
Oh, yes.
What about protection?
She's here. She's here.
Press?
Someone's at the door.
Who's there?
Press, Laura.
It's Dan. I gotta talk to you.
Christ, what does he want?
- What's the problem, Dan?
- I just got this terrible feeling.
I get this strange thought, this image of Sil with Arden.
Sil's next door with Arden, Press.
No, no, no. She's dead, Dan.
I went to his room and there's someone in there with him.
- Did you knock on the door?
- Yes, but I don't know what she'll do.
They're making a lot of noise.
They're having sex.
I know it's Sil, I know it!
Okay.
I believe you. I'll get dressed.
I enjoyed that immensely.
- I felt it.
- What?
It's started.
What's started?
Life.
Oh, my darling girl.
In some cultures, women believe they know the moment of conception...
Don't you believe me? Feel.
Holy shit!
I hope you're right about this, Dan.
- She's headed for the basement.
- We'll take the stairs.
Laura, come with me!
Come on!
If she's pregnant, we gotta get to her before she gives birth.
God. We don't know what we're dealing with here.
She could have a dozen babies.
She could lay 1000 eggs!
Oh, God. Did you see Arden?
Yeah, I did, that poor bastard.
We can trap her. The fire door opens from the inside at the bottom exit.
Then what?
Holy shit.
- Oh, my God.
- The bitch went through a steel door!
Fitch! Dan! We're in the garage!
She got past us!
- You saw her?
- She was gone before we got here.
- Here.
- You saw her!
- Look at the door!
- Which way did she go?
- Where's Press?
- He took off down that tunnel.
She kills if she feels threatened.
She kills if she feels threatened.
She must've come through here.
She went down here.
There's no other way.
Yeah, she's down there.
Let's go.
Stand back, I'll clear it out.
Which way did she go, Dan?
- I don't know.
- What?
I'm not sure. She's here.
Think. You're supposed to have some extrasensory power! Which way?
- Which way did she go, Dan?
- I don't know! I don't know!
- I think she went that way.
- That's good enough for me.
You think she went that way?
You don't fucking know, don't you?
You don't fucking know.
I'll go this way. You come with me.
- Come with me, Dan!
- Fitch.
I think she went this way.
Dan?
Dan?
Fitch. Fitch.
Dan?
What happened?
I can feel her.
She's that way.
She's that way.
I never thought
I'd want to kill something.
Never thought I'd want to.
It's this way. It's back here.
Hey, she went in here.
This must have opened up during the earthquake.
Okay, stand back.
Is that oil?
Looks like it.
I'm going back there to see if I can flush her out.
If she comes back through here, let her have it.
Dan. Dan!
- Dan, what is it?
- I don't know.
I don't know.
Dan.
Okay.
It's okay.
Nobody's gonna hurt you.
You come here.
Come on. I got you.
Press, something's happened to Dan!
You okay?
Shit!
Dan?
Dan?
I'm stuck!
I need your help! I'm stuck!
Dan, you gotta hang on!
Press!
Dan, keep on.
Press!
Hang on, Dan!
Hang on!
I got you.
I got you, Dan. Hang on.
Shit.
Hang on!
Hang on, Dan!
Get rid of her, Press!
Duck your head.
Let go, you motherfucker.
- I got you. Hold on, I got you.
- Shit.
I thought I was dead.
I thought you'd drank your last Long Island Ice Tea.
Yeah, I thought we all had.
Hey, you okay?
Yeah, I'm okay.
My pants are a little messed up.
But I'm okay.
She was half us, half something else.
I wonder which was the predatory half.
The dead half.
Let's get the hell out of here.
I never thought I'd be so happy to be back in a sewer.
Alan, every ten-year-old is afraid of something.
The kid's afraid of tuna-fish sandwiches.
Mercury levels in the tuna.
Whatever.
Alan, the world is a frightening place to him right now.
I think we could be a little more supportive.
Supportive? I'm the most supportive father on earth, but I'm running out of supportive things to do.
I signed him up for Little
League, he drove everybody crazy with statistics about how you can develop tumors from being hit in the head with a ball.
Did you know that shin splints can lead to blood clots in the legs?
Claire, he brought in a medical journal.
Nobody wanted to play after that.
And now I'm building him a tree house, in a tree he refuses to climb.
You know he hates heights.
I don't know. I just want to be a good father.
But you are a good father.
I'm OK! I'm OK!
Aah! No, I'm not!
Hey. Rich!
Well?
You like it?
Uh, yeah, it's great, Dad.
Hey, how about bringing me up that bag of nails?
No, come on up!
Look. Solid as a rock.
Dad, eight percent of all household accidents involve ladders.
Another three percent involve trees.
We're looking at 11 percent probability here.
Fine. Just put the bag in the bucket, OK?
- Rich.
- Huh?
Ow!
Oh! Oh!
Dad! Do you have feeling in your toes?
Yes, I have feeling in my toes.
Oh, Alan, honey, are you OK?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Fine. Oh!
Can't argue with statistics, Dad.
Statistics. Here's something you can do, go down to Gutman's Hardware
Store, buy a pound of these.
But, Dad...
Son, you can't live your life based on statistics.
You've gotta take some chances.
Now come on, buddy.
You can do this.
This is not good.
Definitely not good.
- All right!
- Whoa! Good one!
You went further that time.
- All right! Way to go, dude!
- All right, line it up.
Hey, guys, look, it's Richie Tyler.
Hey, check out his clothes. Hey,
Tyler, where you going, the moon?
Get cable in that thing, Tyler?
Hey, what's the matter, you chicken?
What's the matter, wuss, forgot your training wheels?
Uhh!
Uhh!
No cranial damage.
Oh!
Hello?
Welcome to the library, young man.
Don't tell me. You're here for a special book.
- Mister...
- Stop, stop, stop. Allow me to guess.
I have a talent for guessing what people need.
You're in need of... a fantasy.
Brave knights, mythical fairies, ferocious dragons.
Look, all I want is...
Adventure!
Of course. You're a boy who loves adventure!
Brimming with wicked demons, cutthroat pirates...
No, no, that's not it.
Horror!
Horror! Evil demons!
Wretched monsters! Haunted houses!
Graveyards!
Yes.
It's horror for you, boy.
I'm sure of it.
Your library card, please.
I don't have one.
You do now.
Sign here.
Richard Tyler.
Consider this your passport to the wonderful, quite unpredictable world of books.
But I don't want any books.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
I only came in here 'cause of the storm.
You mean you don't need...
Oh.
I see.
Is there a phone where
I can call my parents?
Through there.
Proceed in a northeasterly direction until you get to the rotunda, and from there head west through the fiction section.
And you'll find it. A public telephone. You can't miss it.
Don't be afraid, boy.
If you lose your way, merely direct yourself back to the exit sign.
Wow!
Jeez!
Whoa! Oh!
Hello?
Uh-oh.
Huh?
Oh! Uhh!
Uhh!
Help!
Mister, mister, where's the exit?
Help!
Wha...
Huh?
I'm... I'm a cartoon!
You... are an illustration.
Who... who are you?
I am the Pagemaster, keeper of the books and guardian of the written word.
You're the guy from up there!
Where are the others?
Why, they're here, of course! And all around.
Maybe you can show me the way out?
Follow me.
I-Is that the way?
Oh, the only way.
Fiction, A to Z!
Where all is possible!
Where a boy's imagination can take root and grow to incredible heights!
Where a boy's courage is a wind that moves him to discovery!
And where your journey begins!
Uhh!
Whoa!
To find your way home, you must face three tests, horror, adventure and fantasy.
And remember this, when in doubt, look to the books!
Aah! How do you stop this thing?
I am the ghost of Christmas past...
All the pirates shared a grave.
Due to the storm, all lines have been temporarily disconnected.
Please try your call again later.
Oh! Ow!
This is not good.
Definitely not good at all.
Where's the son of a sea biscuit knocked me from me crow's nest?
Where's he be? Where's he be?
So here be the lubber who knocked me on me poop deck, and with no apologies too!
You fiction or nonfiction?
I'm... Richard. Richard Tyler.
- What kind of a book would that be?
- Uh, I'm not a book.
Got any proof?
See? Here's my name!
A library card!
Oh, begging your pardon, lad.
I didn't know you was a customer!
Uh, look, all I wanna do is get outta here.
Of course you do, matey! We all do.
But this is a library, mate.
Not everything's as it seems.
Look to the books.
Look to the books.
You... you said you knew the way out?
I know these waters like the back of me hook!
Uh... Uh...
This way.
I gotta get home.
My parents are probably worried sick about me.
Well, I'm afeared
I've been dry-docked in this library far longer than I'd like to remember.
As I sees it, you with your library card are me ticket out of here!
Is it a deal, matey?
Ooh, I'm naked.
Uh, yeah, I guess so.
That's the spirit, lad!
Can we get going now?
Aye aye! Let's scale this mast and get our bearings!
Mast? That's a ladder. I kind of have this thing about heights.
Huh. I'll take care of that.
Mysterious Island. Yes.
Kidnapped.
Ah, here we be! 20,000
Leagues Under the Sea.
Ah, the squid, yes, that's it!
It's a giant squid!
Ah!
Whoa!
Ohh!
Jump, boy!
It's jump for your life!
Ohh!
Uhh!
Let go of my face! I can't breathe!
What are you doing, grabbing me like that and messing up my pantyhose?
Hmph! Now I gotta straighten out my Little Mermaid underwear.
Who... who are you?
I'm Fantasy. Oh!
I'm Fantasy! What is this?
Hm.
It's a library card.
I'm a book, honey. I can read.
Now tell me, what's the one thing you wish for more than anything in the world?
Anything in the world?
L-I'd like to get out of here.
I'll grant your wish, child. But you must do me one small kindness in return.
You gotta check me outta here!
That's it? OK, let's go!
Do I have to click my heels or something?
Honey, you in the wrong story.
That was a close one, lad. Lad?
Hold on there, missis!
The lad's with me!
- You know that short story?
- Yeah, he's adventure.
Honey, that's what they all say.
I heard that! I'll have you know I'm a classic!
Mm-hm. A classic... misprint.
Why, you old sea serpent! I'll rip out your pages and use them for... Oh, no!
Do something!
Hm.
Oops! I forgot. My wand doesn't always work outside the fantasy section.
You mean you can't wish us to the exit?
That overdue shrew's never even seen the exit.
More than you have, shorty!
In fact, the exit's just beyond my fantasy section. Hmph!
Then what are ye doing in these parts?
There a witches' convention around here, maybe?
Look, I was misshelved.
But that's over, now that young Prince
Charming here has come to check me out.
My good eye, he is.
The lad's checking me out!
Come on, boy, we're wasting time chumming off this dinghy.
It's on to the exit for us!
If he thinks the exit's in that direction, you know it's got to be in this one!
Don't listen to her, mate. She's not sailing with a full crew!
Ah-ah-ah!
Fantasy! She's a bloody nightmare.
Let's leave him. He doesn't even know where we are now!
Bilge water! Of course I know where we are! We're...
Hound of the Baskervilles.
We're in Baskervilles.
Have a look-see!
Hm. Huh?
Hey, this way! Through here!
Nice doggy! Good doggy!
Hurry!
Oh, baby.
Are we still in the library?
Aye, lad. The horror section.
It looks pretty scary.
That it does. Just stay close to me and... and you got nothing to worry about.
Mm-hm.
There it is! The exit!
Looks like the only way to reach the exit is through that there house.
No way I'm going in there.
It's your only chance, boy.
It's just a house.
Yeah, but 70 percent of all accidents are household-related.
Dr. Jekyll. Mr. Hyde.
Must be a duplex.
Whoa!
Go ahead, matey. I'm...
I'm right behind ye.
Well? Ring the bell.
Ohh!
- Good catch!
- Here, take it.
Isn't he sweet?
Oh, I scared you.
I'm sorry!
You mustn't judge a book by its cover.
Look, he's smiling!
That's a smile?
All right, teatime's over.
Let's start navigating this house.
Huh? No, wait! Don't go in there!
It's scary inside!
Ha! I ain't afeared of nothing!
I'm afraid.
Of what?
Or, of...
And... Aah!
And...
And...
Uh, I know how you feel.
Horror always has sad endings.
I come from a world of happy endings.
Why don't you come with us?
Yeah! And maybe you could help us through the house.
Through the house? Hm.
Uh.
You can do it.
'Kay.
Friend?
Oops!
Come on!
Hm?
He-hello?
A-anybody home?
What was that?
Nevermore!
Get me out of here!
May I assist you in some way?
Oh. Hello there, Mr...?
Doctor. Dr. Jekyll.
Well, sir, we did ring the bell.
It's all my fault. I was trying to help them find their way to the other side of the house.
The other side?
My boy, I derive no pleasure in telling you that you are in extreme danger.
- Danger?
- Even as we speak.
Lurking in this very room, waiting to strike, are forces of evil.
Wait for me! Wait for me!
Every man is possessed of both good... and evil.
Oh, yes.
But enough of that.
Anyone care for a drink?
Hm?
Ah.
I'll have a go with you, doc.
Ooh!
Stay back! This is a man's drink!
Can I have the olive?
Oh!
Uh-oh.
Now look what you've done!
Whoa!
Ooh!
No! No, no! Don't drink it!
Don't, don't!
Dr... Jekyll?
Dr. J?
My name is... Mr. Hyde!
Easy, there!
The stairs, mateys, the stairs!
Ahh!
Help, master! Don't leave me!
This is no way to treat a library book. Sanctuary!
Sanctuary!
Sanctuary!
Honey, you got to help him!
But I... I...
Oh!
At least this wand is good for something.
Come on!
Which way?
Down. Definitely down.
No, up. Definitely up! Up, up, up!
Come on!
What's going on?
Ghost stories.
Ha ha!
Get me outta here!
Aah!
Close the door!
Whoa!
Down there? I... I can't.
Come on, boy! Even books have spines.
Come, master!
I can do this. I can do this.
Aah!
Uhh! Uhh!
Reach deep within yourself, Richard.
Seize the courage.
Uhh! Uhh!
Whoa!
- Yay! You did it! You did it!
- Grand, boy!
Hooray, hooray, hooray.
Wow.
Do ya smell it?
Breathe it in, mateys.
Ha ha!
The land of adventure!
Look! There's the exit!
Hey! Wait for me!
Ha ha ha!
Home, sweet home!
There's only room for one up here.
From now on, it'll be smooth sailin'!
What are ya laughin' at?
Whoa!
Uhh!
A boat!
Is it... safe?
I wrote the book on sailin'. In fact, I am the book on sailin'.
I'm impressed.
We're sinking. We're going down!
Somebody do something!
Thank you.
Shove off, lads!
Jeez, the water looks kind of choppy.
Maybe we should've stayed back there where it was safe.
Whalin' men.
It's Cap'n Ahab, it is!
Another guy with a peg leg.
Mm-hm. Seems to be a fashion statement around here.
- Did you see it?
- See what?
The devil of the deep.
The white whale.
- Hm?
- Moby Dick!
Thar she blows!
I grin at thee, thou grinning whale!
He's possessed!
He's insane!
He's my kind of guy!
Look!
It's headed straight for them!
Thou damned whale!
Thus, I give up the spear!
So, you think I scared it?
He shouldn't swim right after eating, you know. He'll get cramps.
Where did he go?
Aah!
Row! Row for your lives!
Guys! Where are you?
Adventure? Boy, am I ever glad to see you.
Huh?
All right, all right!
Where's Horror?
And Fantasy?
Where are they?
I searched for 'em as much as I could, mate.
I'm afraid... I'm afraid they've gone below with Davy Jones.
No. It can't be.
You guys are the only friends I've ever had.
She's a cruel sea, lad.
They gotta be out there.
Horror!
Fantasy!
Sharks!
We may be joining them other two sooner than you think.
Hey, look!
Help, help! Over here!
Careful, mate. Not all sharks are in the water.
Get us out of here!
This way! Help!
It's a good thing you guys came along.
Ohh! We're missing two others about his size. Did you see 'em?
He's all the catch we've had today.
Huh?
I knew it! It's him!
Who?
The meanest, black-hearted pirate that ever sailed the seven seas.
Long John Silver!
Just set your keel down, mate.
John Silver's expecting live company.
Uhh!
Give the word, Cap'n Silver, sir, and
I'll show you the color of his insides.
Red! Red! They're red!
Stow your cutlass, Tom Morgan.
I want a better look at his outsides first.
Long John Silver!
Aye, lad, the very same.
Well, seeing as how me men plucked you out of the water like a drownin' field rat, you'll be joinin' our happy family as our new cabin boy.
Thanks, but I already have a family.
I really should be getting home now.
Oh, I think you are home.
Heh heh heh heh.
John Silver! Touch one hair on that boy's head, and you'll be answerin' to me!
Well, come aboard, matey! Ha ha.
Uhh!
You wouldn't happen to be going after me treasure, would you, now?
You ain't got any treasure worth goin' after!
- No treasure?
- No treasure?
He's lyin'! There's plenty of treasure for all of ya!
Search him!
The boy, too.
Hm.
Why, looky here.
Here he be, Cap'n.
What might this here be?
Money! It's yours! Keep it!
- Money, he says!
- Keep it, he says!
- Hm. Library card.
- Library card?
A cabin boy don't need no library card.
I'd like to get out of here!
Land ho!
Land ho!
There she be, mateys!
Treasure Island!
Stay on your toes, mate. When they go for the gold, we'll make our break.
Quit your squawkin'!
Look to the map. What's it say?
It's, uh, in the middle, by the waterfall.
No, it's east by some broccoli.
- Give me that!
- Broccoli.
You half-wits!
It's west, by a tree!
East, by broccoli!
They're all idiots.
What sort of way is that for bones to lie?
It ain't natural.
This island's haunted.
It's accursed, it is!
Oh, you're all yellow dogs.
Open your eyes. The bones is the compass pointin' the way to the doubloons.
It's gone!
Dig deeper, boys!
I say, dig deeper!
Find the treasure!
One gold piece. This is your treasure, is it?
Let's kill him and eat his parrot.
Stand by for trouble.
We mighta known you'd double-cross us.
Throw down your weapons, John Silver!
Why, you pack of back-bitin' dogs!
You'll be regrettin' this, George Merry.
Save your speeches.
Dead men don't bite.
16 men on a dead man's stomach...
No! No! Chest! Chest!
Chest! Chest!
Yo, ho, ho and a bottle of rum!
Evil spirits.
Sanctuary!
Ohh.
Horror! You're alive!
Not for long. Hee hee hee hee hee!
Aah!
Ohh!
Ohh-Ohh!
Ahchoo!
Fantasy!
Naturally. Well, who were you expecting, honey, the tooth fairy?
Get them!
Ha ha! At last, a good fight!
Aah!
Uhh!
Get me outta here!
Hey!
Why, you...
Uhh!
Get the boat, boy. We're gonna be shovin' off.
I'm not going with you.
The sword, honey. Get the sword.
Don't even think it, boy.
He ain't got the heart.
Hyah! Uhh!
Stay back!
Avast there, laddie.
Somebody could get hurt with that blade you got thar.
Be careful, master.
In the boat.
Huh? Easy now, matey.
Easy. I'm goin'.
Right ye are.
Into the boat, aye aye.
Ye be a hard lad, Richard Tyler.
Good sailin' to ya, shipmate.
15 men on a dead man's chest
Yo, ho, ho and a bottle of rum
- Way to go, honey.
- Yes!
Whew. Oh, I wish my dad coulda seen me.
Boy, I thought you two were goners.
We almost were, until this enchanting fellow discovered he could float.
It's hollow.
- Who's there?
- Adventure!
Adventure who?
What do you mean, Adventure who?
Open the blasted door, you dog-eared...
Aah!
Perfect timing.
I was just thanking these guys for saving us.
I coulda taken the lot of 'em with one hand tied behind me back!
That's just his way of saying thanks.
You're welcome!
Ahoy, matey!
Aye, we're lusty adventurous men.
Go away. You don't know what you're talkin' about.
L-I know I'm not your favorite kind of book, but I could be just like you.
You'll never be Adventure!
Ye ain't got the spine for it.
And take that stupid thing off!
Sorry.
Thinks he can be a pirate!
Seize the courage, Richard, then you will reach the exit.
I'll never get home.
You did good, honey.
I lost the library card.
I can't check anybody out.
We'll never get to the exit now.
Honey, never say "never" around Fantasy, because sometimes you've got to fight to make a wish come true.
So come on. Don't quit on me now.
Yeah.
Huh! That crazy hunchbook. Ahh.
You don't see me pretending to be Horror.
Why are you sittin' around like a bunch of 0l' wenches at teatime?
Pick one.
Mmm...
That one.
My library card!
I wrestled it away from three sharks who was eyein' it for breakfast.
At no small threat to me life, neither.
Mm-hm.
Where's Horror? Wasn't he with you?
He was, but he, uh... I mean,
I sort of, uh... He, uh...
What did you say to him now?
Well, I, uh... I, uh...
I just, uh, uh...
I'll go find him.
Yeah, you better go find him.
And be quick about it!
Horror!
Horror!
Horror!
Horror.
Hang on, mate! I'm coming!
You're lucky I was published with a thick hide!
Hm?
Come back, ya jellyfish!
Speak to me, mate.
Ye had a good heart and ye was braver than ye knew.
I... I'd walk the plank if I thought it would bring ye back.
That's beautiful.
Huh?
This is too cute.
Uhh!
Are you OK?
Thanks to my friend here.
Get off me!
Did you see that?
See what?
My wand! It's blinkin'!
That can only mean one thing.
The exit!
- The checkout!
- A happy ending.
Ohh!
Let's go! Come on!
Are you sure that swizzle stick of yours is workin' right?
Hm.
I don't know. Maybe we should test it.
You've gone overboard, missis!
Whatever you imagine
Is where your heart can go
There are worlds filled with treasure
Time without measure
To learn whatever you may need to know
Imagine
Imagine
You and I could fly...
- Look! Mother Goose!
- Hey, girl!
And leave all our doubts and fears behind...
Hello, my little baby. Hi!
You see, that's just what can happen
If you look inside your mind
There's no limit to the wonders
You can find
Whatever you imagine
Can make your life brand-new
There are miracles waiting
So keep concentrating
And I promise you that if you do
Whatever you imagine can come true
Wait for me!
Hey! Come here!
Those are my glasses!
Hey! Don't go up there!
What's the matter? Is
Adventure afraid to go in?
What? I live for moments like this.
Look! There it is! The exit!
Me sword! Uhh!
Earthquake!
Quick! Find page 1,001.
Arabian Nights?
That's it!
Ohh!
Get the boy!
Come on! The exit's up there!
We're gonna make it!
- Hooray! We're gonna make...
- Aah! My wand!
Oh, baby. I wish that hadn't happened.
Come on, guys! The exit!
This way, guys!
Aah!
We're almost there!
We made it!
Guys?
This dragon is history!
Don't try to stop me!
Be careful.
Huh? Hm.
You really are a classic.
Mmm!
How would you like to curl up with a good book?
Oh, me binding!
In your dreams!
Ooh!
Adventure, up here!
Go on, lad! Save yourself!
You think a bag of hot air is enough to stop me?
Dragon? He's more like a dragonfly, he is!
Look out!
Uhh.
Happy birthday.
Hang on, guys! I'm coming!
A sword.
Yes!
Ha ha! That's it, boy!
Go for the gizzard!
Bite him, bite him!
Aah!
Yah!
- Watch out for his tail!
- You've got him on the run!
Aah!
I'm not scared of you!
Aah!
Aah!
Huh?
Aah!
I gotta get out of here.
Aah!
Fantasy's wand!
This is not good.
Definitely not good at all.
Uh-oh.
Look to the books.
Look to the books.
Look to the books.
Look to the books!
Alice in Wonderland.
Off with his head!
Sheesh!
Mnh-mnh.
Mnh-mnh.
Jack and the Beanstalk.
Yeah! This is it!
I hate heights!
Aah!
Matey!
He's alive!
Aah!
Come on, guys!
Uhh!
Whew.
Are you all right?
Wh... wha...
Master, you saved us!
That ya did, matey.
Baby, you're the greatest.
Mm-wah!
Who's there?
The Pagemaster.
Hey! How'd you get here?
Quit it! We're in the presence of the Pagemaster.
I know who he is! He's the guy who did all this to me!
Do you have any idea what I've been through?
Tell me.
I was nearly torn apart by a crazy doctor.
I was made a slave by a bunch of mangy pirates, and eaten, got that, eaten by a fire-breathing dragon!
He don't mean it, my
Pagemaster. He don't mean it.
Not to mention being tossed, squashed and scared practically to death.
Yet you stand before me.
Well... yeah.
Think, boy! What kind of an adventure would you have had if I'd brought you here with the turn of a page?
You prevailed over evil.
Ah, you looked Moby
Dick in the eye, boy.
Ah, you had pirates tough, me lad, and don't no one speak any different.
If I had brought you here from the start, you never would have found the courage to face your own fears.
And in doing so, you triumph here and always.
Hey, is that... That's me!
That was you.
I'm ready to go home now.
I mean, we're ready.
The world awaits.
Whoa!
Godspeed to you, boy!
Wait for me!
Aah!
You took quite a spill, young man.
Huh?
Are you all right?
Careful! You'll slip again!
Hey, wait a minute! Wait a minute!
Wait! Uh, I forgot something.
Here.
I'm afraid you can only check out two.
Horror? But I promised him.
You promised whom?
- Look, I need... Just this once?
- Shh.
I have a talent for guessing what people need.
Just this once.
Shh.
Yes!
Good. That was definitely good.
I can't imagine where he could be.
Maybe we should call the police.
Alan!
He's home.
Alan.
It's impossible.
Rich?
We probably should put him in his bed.
Let's let him sleep up here tonight.
Love you, Richie.
Good night, son.
It's dark out here. I wish there was a night-light.
Honey, wish granted.
Ooh.
Hooray! Hooray!
Breathe it in, mateys.
This be the land of adventure.
You can lay to that.
Come here, handsome.
Why you cryin'?
Because I have friends.
That you do, matey.
Aye, that you do.
Ahem.
You know what would make this a happy ending?
A kiss.
OK.
I meant from her!
When this world
The real-life world
You're livin' in
Just gets too much
For you to take
When you find
Too many troubles on your mind
And feel just like
There's no escape
And it seems your heart's forgotten
How to believe
Turn a page in your soul
Mmm, there's a place you can go
Close your eyes and let your heart
Fly free
Fly free
Dream away, dream away
Let imagination light your way
Take you as far
As your heart can see
Dream
Dream away, dream away
To a place where hope is shining
Find your silver lining
Find your silver lining
Everything you need
Everything is...
Just a dream away
Ooh
Remember when
Remember when
A dream could take you anywhere
Anywhere you want to
Just a wish
Anything could be
When the farthest star was one more star you could reach
Take a look in your heart
'Cause that's where dreams always start
Anything is real
If you just believe
Believe, believe
Ohh, Ohh, ohh
Dream away, dream away
Let imagination light your way
Take you as far
As your heart can see
Dream
Dream away, dream away
To a place where hope is shining
Find your silver lining
Everything you need
Everything is...
Just a dream away
All it takes is faith to make your dreams come true
Oh, oh
And somewhere in this world
There'll be somebody
To share your dreams
With you
Hey
Yeah, oh, yeah
Ohh
Oh, yeah, oh
Dream away, dream away
Let imagination light your way
Take you as far
As your heart can see
Dream
Dream away, dream away
To a place where hope is shining
Find your silver lining
Find your silver lining
Everything you need
Is just a dream
Just a dream
Away
Yeah
Whatever you imagine
Can one day come to be
There are dreams to awaken
Roads to be taken
Follow them and they will set you free
Whatever you imagine
ls where your heart can go
There are worlds filled with treasure
Time without measure
To learn whatever
You may need to know
Imagine
Imagine
You and I
Could fly past the sun
And leave all our doubts and fears
Behind us
You see, that's just what can happen
If you look inside your mind
There's no limit to the wonders
You can find
Whatever you imagine
Can make your life brand-new
There are miracles waiting
So keep concentrating
And I promise you that if you do
Whatever you imagine can come true
Whatever you imagine
Whatever you imagine
Whatever you imagine
- Can make your life brand-new
- Can make your life brand-new
There are miracles waiting
So keep concentrating
And I promise you that if you do
Whatever you imagine
Will come true
Ooh
The year 2078.
A mining colony on planet Sirius 6B.
For 50 years, the New Economic
Block, the NEB Corporation, -
- has controlled mining throughout the known solar systems.
20 years ago, on Sirius 6B, -
- the NEB discovered the solution to the energy crisis. Berynium.
But mining berynium unleashed lethal doses of radiation and pollution.
"The Alliance", a federation of mine workers and scientists, -
- demanded mining be stopped.
The NEB 's reponse was to declare all-out war.
This conflict has fuelled a new cold war on Earth, -
- but so far the fighting has been confined to Sirius 6B.
Massive NEB bombing raids have devastated this beautiful planet.
Thousands have been killed by deadly berynium radiation.
Now, in the tenth year of the war, the survivors on Sirius 6B -
- are faced with a new threat beyond imagination...
- Okay, ante up.
- Five.
Okay, I see your five.
- Back in the slammer.
- Those were my last smokes.
This game sucks.
This whole place sucks.
Lieutenant, I think you'd better have a look at this.
What the hell is he doing here?
Tell the captain we've got a situation. A NEB coming in.
- How did he get this far?
- I'm going to take him.
He's mine.
- What are you waiting for?
- Something's not right. He's alone.
Here comes the cavalry.
No matter how many times
I see this, it still makes me sick.
I'm glad those things are on our side.
Our side's the good side, right?
Tell me again, iùs a little blurry.
We created them.
We didn't have any choice.
Without the screamers we'd have lost the war.
- Is the NEB still out there?
- Yeah, but not in one piece.
Just the one?
What the hell was he doing out here?
He had something in his hand that he wanted to show us.
Well...
I guess I'd better take a look.
Are you going out there?
Thaùs a great plan.
Iùs probably some kind of bomb.
Get off your butt and open the goddamn door.
Check your tabs, sir.
CRUCIAL: TO ALLIANCE COM MANDER
- Who wrote this shit?
- Mozart.
- "Don Giovanni."
- Don Giovanni?
What the hell do you want, Chuck?
Tear your eye away from that coin, and I'll tell you.
Iùs the portrait of a sphinx.
It belonged to Augustus Caesar, the first great emperor of the world.
Riddle me this, Caesar. We haven't seen a NEB soldier in six months.
Why does one solitary grunt get shredded by a screamer -
- trying to hand deliver this?
Priority seven. You and me... and
God, if he's still paying attention.
I doubt it.
- Is it a trick?
- I couldn't get into it, either.
- Don't do that!
- Scared you, didn't I?
Jesus!
"From Marshall Richard Cooper,
Fifth NEB Army Command."
"To Joseph Hendricksson.
Matters of extreme urgency."
"Demand immediate peace negotiation."
"Request two officers.
Safe passage guaranteed."
"We await your arrival ASAP."
- Peace negotiation.
- They sound pretty desperate.
- We've been waiting for this.
- What have we been waiting for?
The end of the war.
Maybe iùs another bullshit tactic to get us to lay back.
- MacDonald, are you there?
- Yes, sir.
I want the following message transmitted to San Francisco.
Have received first contact from NEB army in six months.
They wish to open peace negotiations. Please advise.
We picked up an emergency message from a commercial transport.
We're 5 million miles off of the shipping lanes.
Find out what their emergency is.
No clearance, no landing.
Joe, what do you make of this?
Looks like a map of the forward command post.
- They're laying themselves open.
- So why the pony express?
They've been completely silent for two weeks. Not even radio.
But why just one guy?
Why not a patrol?
- Secretary Green is arriving.
- Thank you, MacDonald.
Joe, Chuck, I have some very inspiring news for you all.
Alliance HQ has been keeping it classified. Wrapped up tight.
The NEB Corporation has approached us requesting an armistice.
We could actually end this war.
Reserves of berynium have been found on Triton 4.
After extensive testing, there's no sign of radioactivity.
We are on the verge of signing a world peace agreement.
We'd also renew contracts with the NEB to mine on Triton 4.
These negotiations are extremely delicate -
- and we can't afford to do anything that might upset the apple cart...
- Sorry, sir.
- Fix it.
- There's radiation interference.
- Give me the damn thing.
Morse code was better than this virtual reality shit.
It is imperative to make no contact with NEB Command on Sirius 6B.
I'm sure you won't do anything that would jeopardise our chances now.
Peace, can you believe it?
The NEBs are businessmen.
Now they're mining on Triton 4, peace is in their interest.
- Thank God for Green.
- He's a good man.
He prevented a war on Earth.
A war on Earth mighùve done them some good.
If those assholes rolled around in the mud.
- Which assholes?
- NEBs and us.
- We were all NEBs once.
- Exactly.
I just want to go home.
Whaùs the first thing you'll do?
I've got no plans for the future.
- You have a lot to look forward to.
- Income tax.
Are you going to look her up when you get back?
- What for?
- You tell me.
She couldn't take it.
She's married and moved on...
...and I'm still here.
Not for long.
Do you still think about her?
It used to be every minute, then once a day.
About twice a year
I get a kick in the chest.
What did she look like?
All personnel. Radiation alert!
Please light your reds.
I left mine in the office.
Have you got one?
He must have been a brave man... that NEB soldier.
Alert!
All personnel to their stations.
- They're not civilians.
- No, a troop transport. All ours.
- How bad is it?
- No survivors.
- Then what the hell is that?
- Get me out of here, man!
We're going to cut you out of here.
Just hang on.
"Sirius 6B Transportation."
We've got no transportation service!
- What the hell is that?
- You've got to look at this.
- Look at this.
- And this. Iùs a bomb factory.
Holy shit!
A nuclear reactor!
- When did we last see one of these?
- Whaùs happening here?
Come on.
- Careful. Are you all right?
- Calm down. I'm all right.
- Get this man a tab.
- What the hell's a tab?
- This guy's naked here.
- Hold on a second.
One second!
I'm out of here.
DEPT. OF DEFENCE
REVISED
You wanted to see me, Commander?
Yeah.
At ease, we're informal around here.
Thaùll be all, Rodgers.
- How are you doing?
- Good... there's a scar on my arm.
If you go outside without a tab on, you'll lose your arm. Name?
Private Michael Jefferson.
Gunnery specialist on six levels.
First class.
Level six? You can shoot the dots off a dice at 100 yards.
If you can load it, I can shoot it.
Instructors used to call me "Ace".
- Everybody here calls me "sir".
- Yes, sir.
- Sir, what are they?
- Iùs a sword. Take a look.
Screamers were developed to neutralize the war on the ground.
- How do you know iùs dead?
- I yanked its brain out.
- Thaùll take your finger off!
- You said it was dead.
It still has a mechanical surface reflex.
They get shot up, but can still swing a sword. Pretty smart.
Maybe too smart.
It seems to have modified itself.
Where's everybody else?
The guys who were with me?
- How many men onboard?
- 38, including me.
Now there's one, including you.
Those guys...
I didn't even know them.
I couldn't even talk to them.
Jefferson... what in the hell are you doing here?
There was a nuclear reactor aboard programmed for weapons manufacture.
- I wasn't aware of that.
- You radioed you were civilian.
- Where were you bound?
- Triton 4.
Why were you carrying a nuclear reactor and weapons?
To invade, attack and extinguish the enemy.
- What enemy?
- The NEBs.
You were going to attack the NEBs on Triton 4?
Yes... but we're just a task force.
4,000 Alliance Army regulars are on their way to Triton 4 right now.
- Secretary Green informed us...
- Secretary Green?
- Thaùs right.
- Secretary Green is gone.
He's been gone for almost two years.
We got a V. R. Communique from him yesterday.
Secretary Green was arrested and eliminated by the Alliance command.
Two years ago.
Dismissed.
- I enlisted to fight...
- Dismissed, Jefferson.
- The NEBs have been running...
- Get out of here!
What in GoÔs name are we doing, Chuck?
- We just saw Green.
- We saw bullshit!
You know as well as I do that they can send us anything they want.
- That kid doesn't know policy.
- Get your head out of the lilacs.
Do you expect me to believe that we're being dumped?
That our 20-year stand here has turned into a galactic gold rush?
They keep sending us provisions.
Will they let us die up here while they carry on running the universe?
- I don't buy it.
- Wake up, man!
We are betrayed here, brother.
We are beached.
Green's been shit-canned and this whole place is a lie!
They just can't cut us off up here.
Families on Earth would raise hell.
And they won't take us back there.
If we sound off about this, nobody's going to fight their war for them.
They're just going to let us roll on and on up here.
We ain't ever getting off here.
Marshall Cooper and his NEB Command knows it, too!
He sent us a map.
Your solitary NEB grunt got his ass shot to stop this thing.
They know iùs pointless now.
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to NEB Command.
We'll make our own peace right here.
NEB said they wanted two men.
Somebody's got to stay here in case anyone else falls out of the sky.
- I'll take Johnny Gung-Ho.
- The kid?
I'm not risking any more of our men.
This is your tab.
It won't work for anybody but you.
That makes me feel a lot better.
Screamers only attack living things.
They read your pulse rate.
Your tab broadcasts a false heartbeat, flat-lining you.
In theory they work perfectly, but radioactivity corrodes them.
- What then?
- We thank God you're a good gunner.
I was remembering that day up in Point Reyes.
- That bartender...
- With the monkey.
The beach. We sat drinking beer, watching the humpbacks blowing.
You watched the whales, Joe.
I was watching other things.
We should go back there.
I'd like to see that again.
What, girls volleyball?
Hey, Joe...
I'll see you soon.
On that day. Jefferson, are you coming or are you breathing hard?
Good luck.
Cicero, this is Libby.
Radio check, over.
Cicero reading you loud and clear.
Next transmission will be 33:00 and then every 4 hours after that.
If I miss one, don't sweat it.
If I miss two...
...move into the office, change the music and carry on.
I'll take the office, but the
"Don Giovanni" will have to go.
Roger, copy.
- The air is terrible out here.
- Iùs whaùs in the air.
- What, radiation?
- This'll neutralize it. Here.
- Iùs an anti-radiation red.
- Thaùs what poisoned it?
That used to be the most profitable, wonderful enterprise in the galaxy.
It produced berynium. The answer to the worlÔs energy question.
A spoonful could take you from
Earth to Saturn in a day.
Then those mines started puking up tons of radiation.
We thought we'd discovered gold... but we discovered shit.
And you smoke this shit just to neutralize the shit in your lungs.
- How do you know iùs working?
- If you don't die.
- God! What happened here?
- Blasts.
- NEB bombers.
- They nuked the civilians?
The civilians got in the way.
The bombs were aimed at us.
You just don't have a clue about what brought you here, do you?
You'd fight for any son of a bitch if he convinced you you were right.
- Someone convinced you.
- Not someone, something.
The Alliance was formed to support you.
You're right, Jefferson. And it divided my country and my world.
So as much as you're dying to get shot by some NEB soldier, -
- we're going to make peace with these people, you and me.
We're going to rip you off of that experience.
Look at this place.
I came here 20 years ago to mine berynium for the NEB.
We were all NEBs then.
The scientists found radiation and shut down the mines.
The NEB Corporation threatened them, and there was a stand-off for years.
They they started to rain everything down on us.
Nuclear disc bombs, chain bombs, bacteria crystals.
Civilian survivors were evacuated.
We retreated to the bunker.
- How did you fight back?
- We reinvented an early weapon.
- The sword?
- The autonomous mobile sword.
The screamer.
Save it.
They don't eat rats, do they?
We're not sure.
They're scavengers and they learn.
They use everything. Rotting meat gives off methane gas for fuel.
Maybe eyeball jelly makes good blade wax.
Are they machines? Are they alive?
I don't understand...
I don't have the answers, Jefferson.
- But where are they coming from?
- Underground.
The first design was sent to us from the Alliance on Earth.
Iùs all automated now.
No one's been down there since they pushed the first button and ran.
- They make themselves now.
- And no one knows how?
They're down there breeding like rabbits and no one knows?
Am I speaking Swahili?
Thaùs exactly what I mean.
Hit the dirt!
Come out of there!
Come out of there!
Come forward.
- Stop.
- Can I come with you?
My God...
- Cover me.
- Go.
Jefferson.
You all right? Iùs okay.
What have you got there?
Let me see.
Thaùs a good guy.
No, you keep him.
Thaùs your friend.
Where do you live?
- In there?
- Yes.
In the ruins?
How many are you?
How many people?
- You're alone? How do you survive?
- Food.
- What kind of food?
- Different.
How do you keep away from the screamers?
- The blades underground that kill.
- I hide.
- Can I come with you?
- No, you stay here.
Give me a macro-ration.
We'll give you something to eat.
We'll come back for you.
In two or three days we'll find you.
Take this.
You tear this and eat it.
- I want to come with you now.
- We'll come back in two days.
You take care of this guy, okay?
We can't just leave him here.
He's a kid. He'll never survive.
- What am I saying?
- Can I come with you?
- Whaùs your name?
- David Edward Dearing.
- Where's your mum and dad?
- They died in the blasts.
You've been alone here for four years?
Everything seems to be okay.
Is it safe to make a fire like this?
We want to let them know we're coming.
- Fire keeps the rats away.
- Rats?
I had this friend, he used to eat them. Rats.
You'll appreciate this...
You don't just heat up the oil, that makes them stick to the pan.
You get the pan hot, put the oil in cold, then add your rats.
But don't crowd the pan, it sucks all the heat out.
You keep flipping them, or they burn.
- My friend said...
- Jefferson!
You must be confusing me with somebody who gives a shit.
Give me that rock, boy.
Cicero, this is Libby calling.
- Come in, Cicero.
- Libby, how is it out there?
Iùs cold.
We're at 14 degrees north latitude.
We expect to reach the NEB Command...
...in about four hours. Hello.?
We've got a new arrival.
He came in yesterday.
Chuck, you're breaking up.
You'll get your next transmission at 00:00 hours.
- Libby, over.
- It seems a little strange...
If you're gonna be a rock, be a rock. Don't be a bug.
Don't do that to me!
I nearly pissed my pants... sir.
Things ain't what they used to be.
Jefferson!
- Didn't you hear it?
- No.
- Good God, man!
- Cool, huh?
- Do you know how much they cost?
- Keep that on your wrist.
- Doesn't it work if iùs nearby?
- It stays on your arm!
I'm already dragging one kid around.
Do I have to tie your shoes for you?
Your tab was on and it was going for you.
What is this?
I've never seen this.
It looks like an animal.
Iùs not an animal.
Iùs an upgrade.
- Maybe iùs a NEB one.
- Jefferson, relent.
We're getting out of here.
Take your bear with you.
- Where are we going?
- A long way for you, kid.
You soap the socks the night before.
The water dries out but the soap stays in.
- You've got soap against skin...
- Have you got a dimmer switch?
If you put a teddy bear in a microwave, nothing will happen.
- But a wet frog...
- Shut up.
Jefferson!
Goddamn screamer!
It wanted to kill us.
It can see us and touch us.
I can't tell what the signals say.
It can talk.
- He's a fucking toaster.
- Thaùs right.
Pinocchio's not a real little boy.
- Why didn't it try to kill us?
- It was tagging you.
They're smarter now. They get into our bunkers. They tag along.
Who can resist a kid with a hard luck story?
Once it gets inside, the killing starts. But you knew that already.
- You brought him in here.
- It found us.
What is your reason for being here?
We were invited here for a peace negotiation.
Marshall Cooper sent this from NEB headquarters.
You want to negotiate.?
We ain't gonna do it here.
- Are you taking them to the bunker?
- You got something better to do?
- Sir, do you trust these guys?
- No.
- What are you doing?
- Calling the office. Problem?
Cicero, this is Libby. Come in.
- How is it out there?
- We've got a new kind of screamer.
- I can't hear you real well.
- Iùs a kid. A little boy.
- Don't let it into the bunker.
- I can't hear you.
There's too much interference.
That kid, he was like a person.
How did he know what to say?
You think Santa makes them his little elves?
They've got more brains than you.
Fighting won't solve our problems.
One of those kids tagged my patrol.
We took him into our bunker.
- Nobody got out.
- Except you.
- Whaùs that supposed to mean?
- You figure it out.
You guys brought them here.
Only after the bombing started.
But now they don't care what uniform is covering your ass.
- Neither do I.
- Slow down, soldier.
- Neither do I.
- Slow down, soldier.
Would you mind taking that outside?
Stray bullets are bad for the inventory.
Iùs worth a lot more when it ain't all shot to... shit.
I'm letting you stay here out of the kindness of my heart, Becker.
So follow the ground rules.
First, no gunplay inside.
Second, this is my place, and nobody touches anything.
Real Scotch, not synthetic shit.
No spitting.
Spare a cigarette?
Well, gentlemen...
Live it up.
I haven't had an American cigarette in over a year.
There's plenty back at base, but I forgot to bring them.
- You got the last one.
- Very generous of you.
What is this place, a commissary?
There hasn't been a commissary here in over two years.
Not since those blades arrived.
- Are you a freelancer?
- Right. Black market, Commander...
Hendricksson, Joseph. San Francisco.
Jessica Hanson, Pittsburgh.
How do you do?
- Iùs early in the day for that.
- Yeah.
I'm looking for Marshall Cooper,
Fifth NEB Army.
He'd be in the command bunker, if there still is one.
What about your communication satellites?
If they're still working, they'd be in there, too.
What do you mean by that?
You have no idea of the hell you opened up.
We opened up? Just tell me where the command bunker is.
You wouldn't last ten yards out there without me.
- Have you seen it?
- I heard it.
- Hordes of them.
- What hordes?
Davids. I heard them screaming into the bunker above us.
I heard the soldiers screaming.
Then it got very quiet.
Nothing... except the smell of death.
- Still want a guided tour?
- If Cooper is alive, I'll find him.
I'll take you to Command.
We'll go underground.
- I want something in return.
- Speak.
- I want off this ashtray.
- Where?
Earth. How long do you think
I'm gonna last in here?
Nobody leaves. The NEBs and
Alliance are fighting on Triton 4.
They've hung everybody on this planet out to dry.
Good Lord, you're beautiful.
I can take you back to the Alliance bunker.
- Deal.
- Going somewhere, Jessica?
She's taking me to NEB Command and I'm taking her to Alliance.
Cosy.
And then what?
Become a prisoner of war?
You can relocate anywhere if you can get off this globe.
Or you can go straight to hell for all I care.
You're crazy.
You don't know whaùs down there.
- Afraid of the dark, Ross?
- Get off my back.
Look at this. Iùs one of ours.
She's got everything.
And I found something else.
- What is it?
- A plutonium rocket.
Plutonium? Have I been blowing smoke out of my ass?
We've not used nukes in this war yet and we're not going to use them now.
So leave it.
Okay, leùs get on the good foot.
Anybody thaùs coming, come on.
"When he's best, he's little worse than a man."
"And when he's worst, he's little better than a beast."
I never knew they put
Shakespeare in comic books.
Ain't it sharp enough yet?
Iùs never sharp enough.
I'm not sure if these tabs work, but stay close to me and Jefferson.
Leùs go.
This leads to the maintenance tunnel underneath the command bunker.
I ain't going in there.
Don't tell me a big guy like you is scared of mice!
- Has a rat got your tongue?
- Get off my back.
Is that all you know how to say?
Explain your vocabulary, Ross.
Knock it off!
Just get off my back!
We're almost there.
This is the command centre.
This is the ground level.
REDISCOVER PARADISE ON
SIRUS 6B
- What the hell is this?
- Iùs exactly what you think it is.
I knew it!
We're all gonna die!
Jefferson, if that man moves, or even farts, shoot him.
Shut up.
If Richard Cooper were alive, he'd be here, wouldn't he?
The ComSat stabilizers are all frozen.
This one's free.
Uplink attempt initiated.
Sat Net downlink does not respond.
Malfunction.
Sat Net does not respond.
Way to go, Ross.
Can I come with you?
Jefferson, get everybody out of here now. Do it!
Go.
AUTONOMOUS MOBILE SWORD
TYPE 1 REVISED
Can I come with you?
AUTONOMOUS MOBILE SWORD
TYPE 3
IDENTIFY TYPE 2
Can I come with you?
We're not leaving without Hendricksson.
Can I come with you?
- Can I come with you?
- Jefferson!
Cute, Jefferson.
It won't take them long to get through this door.
- Thanks for waiting, Becker.
- Yeah, next time.
There won't be a next time.
That was stupid.
- What was so important back there?
- What other type?
David was a type 3.
The reptile was a type 1.
Whaùs the other type?
Can I come with you?
Iùs a... type 2.
- Genius. You can count up to three.
- Get off my back!
- Iùs a wounded soldier.
- "Help me. Help me."
There were only a few reported.
We thought you'd discontinued them.
- We've never seen them.
- What do they look like?
- Who do they look like?
- Look in the mirror, Ross.
I'm warning you... just get off my back.
They keep saying the same thing over and over.
Just get off my...!
Exactly.
He's one of them.
He's a machine. Type 2.
He kept repeating himself.
You heard him.
And what about the scotch?
You saw, he didn't take a sip.
Thaùs right, sir.
We offered, but he refused.
Thaùs blood.
- Bullshit.
- Bullshit? Take a look.
I see a human being who got wasted for no reason at all.
- What are you looking at?
- That wasn't very human of you.
Until two days ago,
I didn't even know you existed.
You think I'm one of them?
Then you'd better kill me, too.
See if I've got any switches inside.
Come on, be on the safe side.
Do it!
Man, I'm out of here.
Anybody thaùs coming, come on.
Cicero, this is Libby. Come in.
Cicero, this is Libby. Come in.
If you get killed, will your man let us in?
Not if he's smart.
Do you want me to say I'm sorry?
Well, I'm not.
It was a mistake.
I'll kill you before I let you make another one.
Just got out of basic training, didn't you?
Iùs pretty obvious you're a rookie.
You think you're the centre of the universe, but you're not.
We're just insignificant little specks, you and me.
We're not gonna change the world.
We're not gonna win the war.
Nobody's gonna care that we die.
"Which many signify that you should snarl and bite and play the dog."
- Not me.
- Shakespeare?
Very good.
Cicero, this is Libby. Over.
Cicero, come in. Over.
Goddamn radiation!
Come on, we've got to get closer.
- Come on down.
- We're right in front of the door.
- Come on down.
- We're right in front of the door.
- Come out. Over.
- Bad connection, Joe.
I've got NEBs with me.
Come on up.
You're breaking up, Joe.
- Come up out of the bunker.
- Come on down, Joe.
You come up, Chuck.
- Chuck, thaùs an order.
- Come on down. Over.
- Chuck...
- Come on down. Over.
- Let me speak to Don Giovanni.
- This is Don Giovanni.
Come on down. Over.
- This is your old pal Wolfgang.
- I will open the door. Over.
I'm coming down right now.
Do you copy?
- Come down. Over.
- I'm coming in... Go!
Watch the flame.
- Give me the nuke!
- What?
Give me the mini-pluto you stole out of the bunker!
- Loading.
- Watch your heads.
Hang on!
Help me!
Help me!
- Help me!
- Sir!
Help me!
- Sir.
- I'm okay, Jefferson.
- What about you?
- Becker's down. He's wounded.
Becker...
- He's wounded...
- Hold on, man.
Wounded.
- Help me.
- Jefferson! No!
Down! Down to hell!
And say that I sent you there.
"I came into the world with my legs forward."
"And the woman cried,
'He was born with teeth!"'
I had no father.
I am my own father.
I have no brother
I am my own brother.
This word love, which old farts call blind, -
- be resident in men like you, asshole, but not in me.
I am my motherfucking self. Alone!
Jefferson!
We're gonna die.
You know that, don't you?
Yeah...
...but not today...
...and not here.
Where will we go?
Where do you go when there's nowhere else to go?
Home.
Earth.
Earth.
There's an emergency escape vehicle for use by the commanding officer.
Iùs hidden in these mountains in a place named ironically -
- for where they developed the first atomic bomb. Alamogordo.
I've never been there.
- What are you talking about?
- There's a way off this planet.
- Type 2?
- Hell if I know.
I've never even seen this tag.
I've never even seen this language.
Can I see it?
Yeah.
God! I'm sorry.
Give it to me. I'm sorry.
I had to know.
No! Don't do that... you don't need to.
- Thaùs the last one.
- Iùs okay.
According to this we should be close.
- Does that locator work?
- Yeah.
- Is it up there?
- It should be.
- I don't see anything.
- Thaùs the idea.
I can't go on any more.
I don't want to go on any more.
Listen to me. I don't have anybody.
I don't have a family or a friend or that kid Jefferson.
I don't even have him.
But I have you, do you hear me?
I have you, and we're going home.
I'm taking you home.
BERYNIUM WAS DISCOVERED HERE
ON JULY 16, 2064.
When I took over command, this was coded in my bio-signature.
- It only works for you?
- We'll soon find out.
- It only works for you?
- We'll soon find out.
Then I'm with the right guy.
- What do we do?
- I have no idea.
Leùs try this chair.
What about this?
Elevator activated.
Countdown to launch commencing.
Iùs moving. Get on.
Hang on.
The crane's blocking the trajectory.
- I'll be down.
- Okay.
Please clear launch pad.
Gantry inoperable.
Circuit malfunction.
Launch sequence initiated.
Time to launch: 15 minutes.
- Chuck!
- Remember that bar at Point Reyes?
I guess you'll never see it again.
We all die alone, Joe.
Like the new look, Commander?
What do you think?
Is this me, or what?
I liked the other face better.
Do you know who I got it from?
Marshall Richard Cooper.
Name ring a bell?
Do you know how we got it off him?
Just like your buddy Chuck, we ripped it off.
He was screaming something about God and Jesus.
You're in the wrong place.
I took his face.
He didn't have much use for it.
But I like your face better.
"She couldn't take it. She married and moved on, and I'm still here."
Obstruction cleared.
Prelaunch proceeding.
Down to hell, and say that I sent you.
"I came into the world with my legs forward..."
- Are you all right?
- Fine. Leùs go.
- Prelaunch sequence complete.
- Joe...
- Damn.
- One seat. One life support system.
Get in. We've got eight minutes for you to get out of here.
- You know how to fly it.
- Iùll fly by itself.
Shit!
I'll flip you for it.
Call it. Heads or sphinx.
Rome, Egypt.
I'll flip it. You call it.
All right, Cleopatra, I'll call it.
Rome.
It doesn't matter. You're going.
Now, go.
I can't...
Pardon me, gentlemen, would you mind taking that outside?
Stray bullets are bad for the inventory.
Jessica Hansen, Pittsburgh.
How do you do?
We can smile, we can cry, we can bleed.
We can fuck.
I wanted to tell you. I did.
Not so fast.
Two minutes to launch.
Hey, bitch!
Prelaunch burn complete.
90 seconds to launch.
I didn't want to...
...go back with you. I was afraid.
I know. You were afraid of what you would do.
You're coming up in the world.
You've learned how to kill each other now.
I learned something else, too.
I learned to...
...love.
30 seconds to launch.
This is Joseph Hendricksson aboard EEVT 3. Over.
Alliance San Francisco. Over.
On a prelaunch, requesting emergency clearance for Earth.
Cleared for Earth. Over.

PART ONE
Pietro,
You should be in bed.
I don't sleep anymore, doctor.
Speeping is "out".
- Shit!
- Yes...
- She didn't see us, Raymond.
- I'm sorry, we were not introduced.
- Claire Tourneur.
- I am Raymond, He's Chico.
Chico, you could apologize to...
Madame Tourneur.
- Are you all right?
- No, I'm not.
I'm sorry, I've been an idiot.
I'm sorry.
Will your car still work?
People always want to give definitions.
You say "Rock'n Roll" they ask, "Which kind?".
But I just play rock'n roll.
I'm a drummer.
- Did you hear him playing?
- He's been breaking my head for 15 years.
Raymond is the same. When he says he is buddhist, people go crazy.
- They can't stand him!
- It's not the same.
There's nothing wrong in being buddhist.
- In his job, yes.
- What's his job?
My job is... fuck and fucking.
- I want a beer.
- For a change!
We might stop there.
Leave it there!
Don't touch it!
- Who's there?
- It's me.
I've got to talk with you.
Your bag's heavy.
- This is enough for being rich.
- You might pay a coffee in Rome.
Did you see well? It's 50,000!
What did I say?
It's the price for a cappuccino.
But with this one you could buy half a cow in Ethiopia.
- Have you been there?
- Yes.
- Where else have you been?
- More or less everywhere.
I've never been anywhere.
I don't care.
- Well actually I've been in America.
- So, how much do you have there?
Count them, I leave it here.
Sleep on it.
Perfect!
I don't trust people who do thing for free.
- And you'd be a buddhist?
- Realist!
So?
I agree, for 30%.
- We counted the money, we can find you.
- Calm down Raymond.
If you want to change your mind...
Do as you want.
If the address is not real, we know where to find you.
It's not worth to try to fool us.
We don't know who will fetch the money.
If it's not me, and if you want to contact me, have a drink, listen to some music...
Yes! You never know.
This is my music.
It's just a demo.
Thanks, Chico.
- Don't lose time.
- Don't worry.
Here she is!
Where is she now?
She should be between St. Etienne...
- and Lyon.
- still a long road.
- 15 more minutes?
- At least. Still has to dry up.
- You were lucky, and had good tyres.
- Hurry up!
Eugene speaking, but I'm not here... me neither.
Wait, I have to remove the foam.
- Will it hold til Paris?
- Yes, no problems.
But you're going to draw people's attention with that foam.
I'm Trevor McPhee.
You saved my life.
Oh, it's you, Claire!
So you smoke now?
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Who is she? What is she doing here?
Uncle Anton, I have to...
On the contrary.
Are you escaping from the police?
Where is he from?
And you're... in honeymoon?
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Charly Yu.
OK.
It's for men!
- That way.
- Thank you!
- Miss! Wait!
- A foreigner?
There is a foreign woman.
Madam, are you sure you're not wrong?
This place is for men only!
It's no place for women here!
Only for men, forbidden to women.
Ehi, beautiful!
I need help.
- Winter! No!
- Escape, run!
END OF PART ONE
UNTIL THE END OF THE WORLD
Moving to new frequency. Solar interference. 
Incoming transport detected. 
Docking procedures engaged. 
Thermal sensors detect humanoids, level 36.
Humanoids advancing, deck 47.
 Long wait, demon,
for such a short game. 
Now curiosity is satisfied. 
And it's time... 
for revenge. 
Dr. Merchant, consider yourself relieved. 
 What else, Chamberlain?
He's rerouted all available power to his personal quarters... and he's shut down most of the ship.
I want you to check everything out and find out why.
Yes, sir.
So, we have the company's most productive space station... hijacked and taken out of orbit by the man who built it.
We have the man himself immersed in ancient history,
letting the whole place go to shit. 
- Evaluation?
- Wacko.
I wasn't asking you, Carducci. 
I was asking the expert. 
Well, Rimmer?
Great man didn't live up to your expectations, did he?
I'm sure he will, sir, as soon as I can begin my interrogation.
Where's your crew?
I made them leave. They're headed for
Earth. Look, time is of the essence. 
Was there some technical problem?
No. Yes.
Yes, that's it.
There's been a technical problem, and you... all of you have to get the fuck off this station right now.
- When we go, you come with us.
- No, you don't understand.
Help me, then.
What's your name?
Rimmer.
I'm playing the endgame here, Rimmer, finishing something that began centuries ago, and I don't have the time to help you understand.
You don't know what you're playing with. 
What are you afraid of?
Whatever it is, it's here... in this station.
That and things your little rational mind couldn't even dream of.
But I dream.
Oh, I dream.
Parker was right. 
You are crazy. 
I built this place for a reason:
To create the biggest trap in the galaxy.
- What did you expect to catch?
- Hell is what I'm going to catch.
And I'm going to burn it away in a blaze of light.
You're serious, aren't you?
If I tell you the whole story,
will you let me finish what I began?
Centuries ago, a man, an ancestor of mine,
Phillip L'Merchant,
built a puzzle box, the first box,
his finest work. 
Commissioned by a wealthy aristocrat named De L 'Isle,
a man obsessed with black magic,
a leader of the occult. 
Phillip was so proud of his work,
a work that would establish his name,
his family... my family. 
He didn't know the great power the box held... 
and the unspeakable things it would release...
the evil,
the sins,
the pain. 
- Is it done?
- Done.
- Is it wonderful?
- Wonderful.
Are you brilliant?
The finest toy maker in France.
Oh, what does it do?
Oh. It doesn't actually do anything. 
It's my masterpiece.
You simply couldn't understand.
I was working to a commission to a very specific request.
It's almost midnight. 
Where are you going?
- The Chateau De L'Isle, to deliver the box.
- Now? Why?
Because my work might be appreciated there.
It's late.
Stay with me.
Stay with us.
I must go.
My son will be born in a better place than this.
This is only the beginning.
I can feel it.
All alone in this dark, dark world.
No home, no family. 
Not even christened,
I understand.
 Jacques,
show this child to a chair. 
Enjoy.
Careful!
I'd be mortified if you sliced your little finger.
Such a gentleman.
Are you always such a gentleman?
No.
Not always.
Monsieur De L 'Isle is
France's greatest magician. 
- What is this?
- So you don't bruise.
Easy, Jacques. 
Keep the pressure steady. 
She has spirit.
Splendid.
Now we can begin.
Ahh, L'Merchant.
As precise as your pieces.
As timely as your toys.
And where is the box?
Pay him, Jacques. 
Thank you.
Good night, toy maker. 
Take her in to the laboratory.
Find the right instrument. 
We must make a clean... incision... 
so that we can remove the innards... 
so we can replace the flesh again. 
Yes, the gizzard. 
We'll scrub this.
Now we can raise her up off the ground. 
That's it. 
Walk now amongst us!
-  My God. 
- Fear not, Jacques. 
Remember your lessons.
A summoned demon is yours to command.
Unless you stand in hell's way. 
Yes.
He who summons the magic...
commands the magic. 
You are... 
Angelique. 
He who summons the magic...
Commands the magic.
 'Tis no story, Auguste. 
I saw what I saw, heard what I heard. 
The box opens the doors to hell. 
This is the 18th century,
Phillip, not the dark ages.
The world is ruled by reason. 
We even got rid of God.
And if there is no heaven, then it follows reasonably... that there is no hell.
I was at its very window last night!
Very well.
Suppose, for the sake of argument,
that what you fear happened has happened. 
A box that can open the gates of hell must be able to close them.
The box belongs to people with little interest in closing such doors.
Well, then the solution lies literally in your hands.
You've designed a machine that you fear can bring forth demons.
- Yes.
- Then design a machine that can destroy them.
Phillip had the design. 
That design. 
It seemed an impossible task. 
But he had to try, try something.
And his only hope was to steal the box, the puzzle box that he had created with his own hands.
 Unbutton my shirt. 
Yes. 
Turn around. 
Oh, yes. 
Toy maker, you have such pliant fingers. 
I want them to play with me. 
And take my soul?
It's already gone, toy maker.
Demons will walk the Earth, and you're responsible.
Think of that.
You and your bloodline cursed 'til the end of time because of your little puzzle box.
What are you waiting for? Kill him and come back where you belong.
Such pliant fingers.
My God!
Please forgive me.
I didn't know what I was doing.
We've got to get you out of here.
It's too late.
They're back. Save yourself. 
Save the child.
Jacques was right.
Demons did walk the Earth, the same way they're walking this station right now.
From a puzzle box?
Angelique had many boxes made from his design,
but it wasn't enough. 
She wanted a box that would open the gateway forever. 
- And your family?
- Was the key. 
But they treated it the same way you treat it.
Like a fairy tale.
But their blood remembered.
And as the generations passed, there were Merchants who dreamed of puzzle boxes... and doors leading to hell.
And then one of them met... Angelique... much, much later.
Even in sleep, you want me.
Even in dreams, you watch me.
Yes, I know.
I know what's in your heart.
John Merchant.
Look at me, look at me, look at me.
Are you okay?
Oh, God, I woke Jack again.
Mommy! Mommy!
You look terrible.
I'm worried, and I really think you should see someone.
You know I've been having these dreams all my life.
John, honey, they're getting worse.
It is your goddamned grandmother.
She was weird, John.
You remember those stories about how, how important you are and how important the family is?
Honey, she put stuff in your mind.
Not all of it.
There are other things.
Things that feel like memories, impossible memories.
And they just don't haunt my dreams, they haunt my work.
- Everything that I've done...
- I don't want you haunted, and I don't want you hurt.
It's not that.
It's... It's stress.
It's this this banquet thing. 
I hate crap like this!
Oh.
Then you shouldn't be so good.
- But it's not ready. I'm not sure if it will work. 
- Right.
So that's why your face is on this magazine cover. 
L'Merchant!
The bloodline continues, toy maker.
I'm restless, and you're bored.
I think we should see America.
Screw America.
Then I would like your permission to go by myself.
Don't you want to know why I'd like to go?
Is that your final word?
Angelique, let's make this clear.
What you want is irrelevant.
It's about what I want.
After 200 years, you should know what those things are.
Jacques, have I ever disappointed you?
- No.
- Close your eyes.
- Don't move.
- Why?
So you won't bruise.
- Is this a new game?
- Oh, yes.
It might hurt... 
Just a little.
 Jacques, do you remember
De L 'Isle's lesson?
Perhaps I was a bit hasty.
Enjoy.
I forget. 
You like it rough, don't you?
Please!
Yes, you like it rough!
It hurts. 
It hurts.
Oh, please. Please.
You broke the number-one rule, Jacques.
You tried to stand in hell's way.
What are you talking about?
The toy maker's bloodline has survived.
The box.
America.
 It's both my pleasure and honor...  to present this award on behalf of the architectural community... to Mr. John Merchant.
John.
Thank you.
I've always thought that the... applause from your peers is the best kind of applause, and I am truly touched by, uh, your reception... and by this award.
Originally, when I had put myself...
Leonardo da Vinci once said that no work of art... is ever completed, only abandoned.
And I never understood what he meant until now.
Thank you.
Good night.
Very nice speech.
Honey, it's okay. 
Let's just go. 
 Toy maker. 
 I know I brought it with me. 
- Idiot!
- I'm sorry. I'm very sorry.
- I didn't even see you.
- Oh, forgive me.
- I'm very sorry.
- That was very rude.
Now I'll have to think of a way to make it up to you.
Why are we going to the basement?
At least tell me your name. 
Do we really need to know each other's names?
Mystery woman, huh?
Aren't you excited by mystery?
Ooh, yeah. You bet.
You seem to be pretty familiar with this place.
I'm just following my instincts.
Do you like games?
You're a dream.
Almost.
Close your eyes. 
Trust me. 
Okay.
What's going on?
Can I look now?
You can look now. 
Time to play another game.
I have such sights to show you.
All right.
What's happening?
Angelique.
Things seem to have changed.
Hell is more ordered since your time, Princess.
And much less amusing.
- The box did this?
- A man did this. 
But the box called him.
It called to his blood.
His ancestor made the box...
and would have unmade all of us. 
You've been away too long,
Princess.
This is not a room.
This is a holocaust... waiting to wake itself.
If we could just move this whole thing right up... to give it a little more height.
- There's a woman here to see you.
- Tell her to have a seat, okay?
- Okay.
-  John Merchant and Associates. 
I know you.
You've no idea what a pleasure it is to meet you again.
This is all very good.
You're the one we've been waiting for.
Who are you?
A friend, I hope.
A client, I'm sure.
Is this yours?
No.
This has been in my family for hundreds of years.
I'm working on something based on it. 
- May I see it?
- Nobody's seen it.
Then let me be the first.
To put it simply, it's something
I want to do with mirrors and lasers. 
See, in theory, it's possible.
Perpetual light.
Trapped light feeding off its own reflections. 
 I haven't perfected the light yet. 
Something's missing, and I can't make it work. 
It'll go for a few seconds...  then it'll blink out.
Sometimes a few seconds are more than enough,
toy maker. 
What did you call me?
You think you don't remember, but your blood knows.
Let it remind you.
- Angelique.
- You know me from dreams.
John Merchant.
John L'Merchant.
We have a destiny... together.
I don't believe in destiny.
You think your work on the building was an accident?
It called to you, John.
We have great work to do.
I shall be in touch.
Whatever you want.
Whatever you want.
What time is it?
- Hello.
- L'Merchant.
I have to see you.
-  Can we meet? Today. 
-  Yeah. Okay. 
-  We'll go over it tomorrow. 
- At your office.
Okay. Bye.
Business.
Some Japanese client.
Got no sense of time.
I grow impatient with the Princess.
Human acquiescence is as easily obtained by terror... as by temptation.
- New building.
- Must be.
- Settling?
- Yeah. Settling.
Still hungry?
Ready for something that screams?
 So she starts asking me all kinds of weird questions. 
Like what?
Like, would I do it with a woman that used to be a man?
- Like with a guy that had it cut off?
- Yeah.
Hormones, the whole bit.
- So, what'd you say?
- I mean, I guess so.
If she was cut and all.
- What's this?
- It's a door.
I know it's a door, but it isn't on the chart. 
Genius college boys.
A pity the mirror will not show your true beauty, Princess.
Your human admirer may not sense it, but I can smell the exquisite stench... of what you really are!
 You know, I'm starting not to like this so much. 
- You know, I was just thinking the same thing.
- Well, maybe...
Shit!
- We should check it out. 
- Speak for yourself.
This is getting weird.
You coming?
Go ahead. 
Check it out. 
Well, at least watch my back.
You got it.
You look like death, Princess.
Temptation is illusion.
But the time for trickery is past.
In this game, we show ourselves as we really are.
What's that?
The beauty of suffering.
You are no different from that beast... that sucks the bones you throw to it.
And you, Princess.
What are you?
You scared the shit out of me, man! What's wrong with you?
My flashlight died.
I tripped and fell.
From now on, we stick together. Always. 
Together. Right.
Someone's messing with our heads.
 Freeze!
- Just back it up against the wall!
- You heard him. Back it up!
Don't make us put some pain on you.
Pain?
How dare you use that word.
He's got pins in his head.
What you think of as pain... is only a shadow.
Pain has a face.
Allow me to show it to you.
Gentlemen,
I... am... pain.
I know your fear.
I hear it.
"Please, don't separate me from my brother. "
I give you my word... 
that will never happen. 
A lesson, Princess.
Work with me, or for me. 
Temptation is worthless,
Princess.
Suffering is the coin of the realm. 
I will teach your human Merchant about the value of suffering.
I will buy his secret... with a bounty of pain.
They say the greatest suffering...  a parent can know... is the loss of a child.
Honey, Mommy'll be back in five minutes, okay?
- Jack.
- Mom, I'm concentrating.
-  I don't know what I'm doing here. 
-  I had to see you. 
Whatever you want.
We were good together, John.
Yes.
We will be again.
 Mommy!
Oh, God!
Oh, thank God!
-  Jack, honey, baby, come here. 
- I can't, Mommy.
He won't let me.
What, baby?
- Mom. 
- Oh, God.
Young... unformed.
Oh, what appetites
I could teach him.
Just give him to me, please!
Oh, you suffer beautifully.
But I am here for business, not pleasure.
- Just tell me what you want.
- Oh, I want bait.
Live bait.
Bobbi! Jack!
Bobbi!
You stay here.
Oh, thank God. 
John, don't!
Easy. 
I don't know who or what you are... and I don't care.
I just want my wife and my kid back!
Oh, I understand... how you love this boy.
You have plans for him. 
Hopes and dreams. 
A whole imagined future... where you love him and watch him grow.
- Yes.
- Then complete your work.
Or, though the boy will not die here, for a thousand years his dearest wish will be that he had!
For God's sake!
Do I look like someone who cares what God thinks?
Just tell me what you want.
The box.
Apathway to hell...  made by an ancestor of yours.
The room downstairs... potentially a bigger pathway.
You will help... to fulfill its promise.
Come on!
Come on, Jack.
This way.
Come on!
- We're gonna split up. Take the other stairwell.
- What?
I've got a plan. Jack, it'll be okay.
All right? You can do it.
Come on, you bastard.
It's me you want.
Don't flatter yourself. 
I don't want you, child.
I want what you were born with: A gift.
The lights.
Oh, no. Not light. 
Darkness is where you find me. 
Good. 
Stand your ground. 
Family man.
The box, once thought so powerful, is only a model.
What you will give me is the true version. 
No longer will we have to seep into your world... like pests through cracks in the baseboards.
Once and for all, we will open the gates, lay low the ramparts.
Isn't that what the Princess wants from you?
Isn't that the game that you two have been playing?
- This isn't a game.
- Oh, yes.
This is a game.
And now it is time... to play.
I shall go first.
Daddy!
Run!
It is time to open the pathway... forever.
That's impossible!
No. No!
Does this pathway work both ways?
Toy maker. 
Come here, Jack!
So young.
So tender.
- So ripe.
-  Daddy!
- Get your hands off of him!
- Get your hands on the console, toy maker.
You have work to do. 
 Open the pathway for me!
The toy maker's design.
Do it!
- Jack!
- Daddy!
- Run, Jack!
- No more games.
- Jack!
- Mommy!
You go play with your dog, you bastard!
The boy lived.
He carried the bloodline, the guilt for what our family had begun.
And how to undo it.
Did he carry that too?
Yes. It was passed down through the generations.
It came upon me first in my dreams.
My blood was speaking to me while I slept, telling me to make good the damage
L'Merchant had done... all those centuries ago.
Dr. Merchant, what were you doing... when Parker and I found you in your cabin?
Summoning a demon or two. 
Maybe more.
- And did you succeed?
- Oh, yes. 
It was much easier than I thought.
Merchant, do you hear me?
I know you're watching.
We'd almost given up waiting for you to play.
Long wait, demon, for such a short game.
Short? Ohh.
Is that any way to treat an old friend of the family?
No. Tell the truth,
Merchant. 
You're pleased to see me.
Your impatience... has matched my own.
Perhaps.
But now curiosity is satisfied.
And it's time for revenge. 
Dr. Merchant, consider yourself relieved. 
Not now.
I let them out!
What's wrong with this is I don't believe in hell.
But it believes in you, and it's out there right now. 
I don't frighten easily.
Well, stop thinking and start feeling!
Your gut knows that I'm telling you the truth.
There's something in this station right now that wants our souls.
And whether you believe in hell or not, it's gonna take us there.
Solar alignment in place. 
- Twenty-three minutes to complete mission. -
Please... get off this station.
Let me save at least one soul.
We go together, or we don't go at all.
Then we go together.
Just let me finish.
Rimmer, we're pulling out as soon as
Parker finishes checking Merchant's cabin.
Get him out of there now.
You don't know what they're capable of!
Rimmer, escort the prisoner to his cell and prepare to leave at 04:30 hours.
What the...
 Help! Help!
- Save me! Hurry!
- My God!
- We're trapped!
- Hurry!
Help!
Get us out of here!
Hurry!
In here!
What the hell is this?
The remnants of a most unsatisfying victim. 
Still...  you're here to change all that.
Aren't you?
 Merchant has a plan. 
Kill them all.
I keep trying to raise Parker.
He's not responding.
- I'm going to go check it out.
- He's dead!
And if you don't let me out to finish my work, you're all dead!
Chamberlain.
Parker's dead.
- What?
- Parker's dead. 
Oh, God.
Don't know what the hell's going on.
Just remember:
Shoot first.
Out. 
Help me, please!
Please, help me!
Please.
Help me.
Mr. Chamberlain?
What the fuck planet are you from?
Come on. 
- Can you still do it? Can you stop them?
- I can try.
I need a couple of minutes to get the coordinates locked in from here.
Give you a chance to get to the ship.
Go. Now!
-  We can't leave without Carducci. 
- Carducci, come in!
I'm going after him.
Get to the ship.
That weapon will not protect you!
But I know something that will.
Oh, no.
He said it could protect me.
He told me what to do. 
Please, go ahead.
It's a box.
It's just a box. 
Thank God for men of reason.
 Finish it. 
Now the final movement begins. 
Soon the bloodline will be severed.
You and your ancestors have proved worthy opponents.
The taste of victory... is almost bittersweet.
Glorious, is it not?
Perfect. 
The creatures that walk on its surface, always looking to the light, never seeing the untold oceans of darkness beyond.
There are more humans alive at this moment...  than in all its pitiful history.
The Garden of Eden.
A garden of flesh.
Nowhere to run this time, toy maker. 
No escape.
Double back down this hallway and get to the shuttle.
- You've got five minutes, Rimmer.
- Together, you said.
- I'm not done here.
- Well, then, I don't go.
I'm coming right after you.
Just be ready.
We're not gonna have much time once this thing goes.
Trust me.
I'm not going to sacrifice myself if I can help it. 
I'm not that crazy.
Oh, my God.
Here, doggie.
Play dead.
 Dr. Merchant, two minutes to complete mission. 
Two minutes.
Two centuries.
It all ticks by so quickly.
You are so very like your ancestor.
Did you know that?
I have the distinct sense of deja vu.
The same defiance, the same faithless hope in the light.
- And what do you have faith in?
- Nothing. 
I am so exquisitely empty.
Then it won't hurt you to die.
Will it?
I cannot die.
I am forever.
 Dr. Merchant, one minute to complete mission. 
Where are you, toy maker?
Here.
Hologram. See, it's all done with mirrors. 
Like this.
What have you done?
I have faith in the light.
- What?
- The light, demon. The light. 
- Endgame, demon.
- No!
I cannot die!
 Welcome to oblivion. 
[ YeIIing ]
[ YeIIs, Grunts ]
- [ Whinnies ]
- Hah ! Hah !
[ YeIIing ]
[ Horn BIowing ]
- You fight weII.
- Thank you, sir.
So, you want to be a soIdier in my Dragon Legion.
I've passed aII your tests.
No, no. Not aII.
This... is for chopping wood !
A barbarian tooI.
[ SoIdiers Laughing ]
This-- yes-- is for waging war.
A nobIeman's bIade.
Hah !
[ Laughing ]
You !
Hah !
[ Grunting ]
You give away your position. Hah !
- So do you !
- [ Laughing ]
SiIence !
- [ Pants ]
- [ YeIIing ]
[ ChuckIing ]
Perhaps you shouId go back to your ax.
[ ChuckIes ] Ah, don't feeI bad.
Few men can hoId their own against me.
[ Laughing, Sighs ]
Who are you ?
KuII... of AtIantis.
AtIantis ?
You're wasting your time here.
Every man in my Iegion is of nobIe bIood.
My bIood's red as any man's.
[ ChuckIing ]
Take heart, KuII. There's a pIace in this worId for aII of us.
- GeneraI TaIigaro !
- Even a barbarian Iike yourseIf.
- GeneraI TaIigaro !
- [ Horse Neighs ]
- [ Grunts ]
- [ Laughing ]
GeneraI TaIigaro, the paIace is in chaos.
The king is sIaughtering his heirs.
[ KuII ]
NobIe bIood... aII over the paIace fIoor.
[ Men YeIIing, Indistinct ]
[ Horse Neighing ]
Hyah !
Hyah ! Hyah !
Faster ! Faster !
Whoa !
What have you done, Borna ?
My eIders chaIIenged me for the throne, so I've spared aII my chiIdren any future disappointment !
This is madness, sire.
TaIigaro, so you, too, wiII have my crown.
You want it.
Take it ! Here !
Take it !
There'II be no more bIood spiIIed tonight, except your own if you insist on it.
Treason !
[ Laughing ]
I spare your Iife tonight.
[ Grunting, Groaning ]
The crown, KuII.
Give it to me.
It's my birthright.
Succession faIIs to me. Give it to me.
[ Man ]
HoId !
I am next in Iine, cousin !
-[ FIesh Searing ] Ahh !
-Lords, points of Iaw must be cIarified.
- The crown is mine !
- [ King Borna ] No !
It's mine.
And I give it to--
I give it to you, KuII.
Here ! Take it.
And keep it if you can.
[ Laughing, Choking ]
The sacred Iaw of succession-- undeniabIe and irreversibIe.
- Long Iive the king.
- Long Iive the king.
Long Iive the king.
[ SoIdiers ]
Long Iive the king !
Long Iive KuII.
[ Whispering ]
Sire, you, you no Ionger need bow to anyone.
- My king.
- Sire.
Borna's harem,
Your Majesty.
[ Chattering ]
And now yours.
InduIge me, Tu.
Even a king shouId bow to the Iadies.
Down.
You stiII read the hands of fate.
You read them for me once.
''King by the hand of a king,'' remember ?
I'm surprised you remember, miIord.
You were very drunk.
SiIence !
You are insoIent.
[ ChuckIes ]
But honest.
Yes, I was drunk, though I do remember.
Borna had a fit because I grabbed you about the waist and tried to kiss you.
You did kiss me, and it wasn't my waist you grabbed.
[ ChuckIes ]
What is your name ?
Zareta.
Ah.
Bring your cards to my chambers, Zareta.
Leave us.
- ShaII I undress, sire ?
- No. ShuffIe.
UnfoId my kingdom's destiny in the cards.
First, the hand of the spirit.
- The tiger.
- That's my totem.
- I was caIIed ''the Tiger'' when I was a pirate.
- A sign of majesty and power.
Next, the hand of being.
A quest.
My whoIe Iife has been a quest.
The hand of destiny.
Destiny.
The kiss.
The fate of your kingdom wiII be found within a kiss.
A kiss ?
Is that so ?
ShaII I undress now ?
Are you in a hurry ?
I am whatever you wish.
My women don't pIay games.
I'm not your woman.
I'm your sIave.
[ Both Grunting ]
Tu was right.
You are insoIent.
- But honest.
- I do not take women against their wiII.
As Iong as they come to you on command and not by choice, how wiII you know ?
I'II do my best to satisfy you in the bedchamber now, but do not mistake compIiance for enthusiasm.
The destiny of a sIave is to submit.
Now, shaII I undress ?
I don't need to be taught a sIave's destiny.
I Iearned that Iesson chained to the oar of a pirate gaIIey.
For five Iong years,
I Iearned.
Tonight I sIeep aIone.
[ Door RattIes ]
Your Majesty.
Hear me now. AII sIaves of VaIusia shaII be set free, starting with my own.
You, go home.
I am home, Majesty.
I was born here in the paIace.
Oh. WeII, from now on, you wiII receive a fair wage.
You, where are you from ?
ZaIgara, Your Majesty.
You wish to go home ?
- WeII, do so now. You're free.
- KuII !
Free VaIusians have a right to own sIaves under the Iaw.
The Iaw is changed.
Sire, Iook, um, for thousands of years, this Iaw has been on this stone.
It was carved by our forefathers, and it may not be aItered.
No matter how crueI or unjust the Iaw ?
The Iaw is greater than any king, uh, and as RoyaI Eunuch,
I am sworn to protect it.
[ Groans ]
[ Cheering ]
Long Iive the king !
Long Iive the king !
Freedom !
- [ Whip SIashing ]
- [ Man Shouting ]
Our days are numbered !
The force of the peopIe never rests.
Your time is short, too, Mandara.
Mandara.
Who is this man ?
AscaIante,
High Priest of VaIka.
He was trying to reopen his tempIe.
He was exiIed by King Borna for heresy.
No ! For speaking
VaIka's truth.
VaIka aIIows the unhoIy fIame to burn as a reminder of godIess times... and as an omen of things to come.
Nonsense !
- ReIease him.
- You can't !
Is there some ancient Iaw which prevents this too ?
If so, teII me now.
UntiI then, Iet men worship what gods they wiII.
- [ PeopIe Cheering ]
- Reopen your tempIe, priest.
[ Cheering Continues ]
- You're going too fast, KuII.
- Not fast enough.
Long Iive KuII !
- The staff goes in the other hand.
- Oh.
Long Iive KuII !
Long Iive KuII !
- Long Iive KuII !
- Members of the RoyaI Court, peopIe of VaIusia.
For centuries the Topaz Throne... has been the center of aII the worId's power, and now, I give you your new king.
Long Iive KuII !
Long Iive KuII !
Long Iive KuII !
[ Screaming ]
Enemy spies, Your Majesty, no doubt sent from Commoria.
No doubt.
You sent for me, sire ?
Yes. To say good-bye.
Good-bye ?
I wiII not command your affections, Zareta.
You're free to go.
We'II aII be damned.
I choose to stay.
Why ?
To be king is to be aIone.
Today's event made that cIear.
I am used to court intrigue, sire.
I can heIp you. I--
Is this the onIy reason you stay ?
Tonight, I sIeep aIone.
I do go too fast.
[ ThundercIap ]
Where is he ?
[ Horse Neighing ]
It's about time, TaIigaro.
Why have you summoned us to this eviI pIace ?
I didn't. I received a note marked with our sign.
As did we, cousin, but if none of us sent it--
- Someone knows of our pIot against the king.
- [ Man ] That's right.
And why it has faiIed.
Enaros.
I'd heard rumors of your ghost haunting the city.
I've had no need for the company of men.
But I see you stiII crave the fIame's embrace.
''Let men worship what gods they wiII.''
Isn't that what your new king said ?
- [ GrowIing ]
- Wizard, what do you want now ?
I've come to heIp with your pIot to kiII the barbarian king.
How ?
You can't sIay this tiger with mere weapons.
You have to trap him first.
[ Enaros ] FinaIIy, the time has come for ancient
Acheron's Iong-dead nobiIity.
[ Hissing ]
[ Grunting ]
Akivasha, the Red Witch.
There she is, the sorceress queen of ancient Zakerof.
Let's see.
The Ieft breast above her heart.
The scroII !
The scroII spoke true.
[ GrowIing, Grunting ]
- Akivasha's bIood.
- [ GrowIs ]
Kanah maya kaIunia gud gamesh.
Kanah maya kaIunia gud gamesh !
Return, O Queen !
Acheron's kiss-- kiss of the sacred fIame--
Iet it fire your souI.
Awake. Awake and rise.
And Iive !
Live ! And ruIe !
Ohh, Akivasha.
Akivasha ? Akivasha.
You are Akivasha. Remember ?
O Queen.
The sacred fIame of Acheron that's burned since your time.
- And my kingdom ?
- Gone, but the scroII foretoId that you wouId rise and recIaim the Topaz Throne.
And so you shaII, with my heIp.
And then, six days from that time, darkness wiII shroud the Earth... and Acheron wiII rise again.
- Who are you ?
- Enaros, your humbIe servant, who's devoted his Iife to your return.
[ Moans ]
The worId has much changed during your Iong sIeep.
Too Iong a sIeep.
[ TaIigaro ]
Good morning, king.
Today, you'II meet the finest peopIe in aII VaIusia.
Who knows ?
Perhaps you'II find your queen here.
- My queen ?
- Yes, yes.
You can have your choice. A proper marriage wouId appease the nobiIity.
I can have any woman I want ?
- [ ChuckIing ]
- Your Majesty.
Good morning, sire.
Uh, come. Take your pIace for the presentation.
You see, miIord, every nobIe has brought the prize of his house.
Fanara, from the House of BaIIin.
As pure as virgin snow.
- We've met. She's not that pure.
- Shh.
- My niece, eunuch.
- NaIissa, niece of DucaIon, came to pay homage, sire.
[ Akivasha's Voice Echoing ]
Come to me. Be my Iover. Queen.
The next girI, sire.
Sire, the next girI.
Take off your veiI.
- Let me see your face.
- Oh.
ProtocoI does not permit.
The king... makes protocoI.
[ Echoing ]
Make Iove to me now.
MiIord, the others.
There are no others.
[ Echoing ]
I am yours.
Mmm.
- My queen !
- [ Cheering ]
My Queen.
A toast to the king and queen.
May your wedding night
Iast Ionger than your courtship.
And may fate smiIe on you both.
WeII, Iet's see.
Zareta, come teII us our fate.
- Zareta.
- [ Cards Drop ]
- What are you doing here ?
- Borna is dead.
Haven't you heard ?
I've missed you.
You are mad to come back.
[ Sighs ]
Not Iong ago, I was just a pirate.
Today I am king, and I have one of the IoveIiest of nobIewomen.
Who'd have thought it ?
I thought it.
- ReaIIy ?
- It was in the cards.
Sit. Divine our future.
WiII you choose ?
Oh, why worry for tomorrow, when we know our destiny tonight ?
No !
- You mustn't !
- [ ChuckIes ] Ow.
[ PeopIe Gasping ]
Your pIaything is jeaIous, husband.
- It's nothing. It's--
- This is the destiny you chose: the death card.
Must I pubIicIy compete for your affection with a paIace whore ?
- Away.
- The cards do not Iie !
- You forget your pIace.
- No !
- Let go !
- [ PeopIe ] Ohhh !
- You okay ?
- It seems our priest here fancies you, Zareta.
Perhaps you'd Iike to go with this... admirer.
I wiII stay and serve the king.
Enough ! Tonight is my wedding night.
Everyone must share our joy.
[ Cheering ]
[ Akivasha Moaning, Gasping ]
[ Echoing ] Yes.
- Ahh.
- NaIissa.
Come. Kiss your bride.
[ Chokes ]
[ Screaming ]
He's dead !
He's dead !
[ Sobs ]
It wasn't the wine.
I had some.
But poison, yes. How ?
Who ?
The whore !
[ SoIdier ]
This way ! Inside !
[ Women Screaming ]
[ BIeating ]
You've done weII.
You've honored our pact, and when I am king, you wiII be richIy rewarded.
[ ChuckIes ]
[ GrowIs ]
Psst.
You Iike the fIame's embrace ?
You shouIdn't pIay with fire, Enaros.
It hoIds so many painfuI memories.
[ Screaming ]
Oh, my hand ! My hand !
- [ ChuckIes ]
- Restore it !
Make it whoIe again !
No ! It wiII remind you who is master.
What are you, witch ?
I am queen... thanks to you.
What do you want ?
I want you, husband.
I was going to kiII you, but after Iast night--
Join me.
I wiII make you immortaI, and the Earth shaII be our empire.
[ Echoing ]
You are mine.
I wouId rather die.
[ Screams ]
So be it.
Do it ! SIowIy.
By the grace of VaIka, I wiII send you back to the darkest pit of heII !
Don't waste your prayers, dog.
Soon heII wiII be coming to us.
You are ugIy.
Your Majesty !
I suspected fouI doings.
I rejoice to find you aIive.
Of course I'm aIive.
I've escaped grimmer dungeons than that.
AII of VaIusia beIieves you've been murdered.
Zareta is to be executed for the crime.
When I get my hands on the bitch demon,
I wiII rip out her eviI heart.
She won't be so easy to kiII.
This mark burns on her breast.
What is it ?
The coin of ancient Acheron.
Your queen was once queen of that eviI empire... when the worId was cIoaked in darkness and demons ruIed over men.
The Red Witch ?
Your bride is over
3,000 years oId.
- She said she was 19.
- She is Akivasha reborn.
From the Topaz Throne she wiII bring back ancient Acheron... and open the gates of heII.
''The fate of your kingdom wiII be found within a kiss.''
Comfy ?
FIeas.
HaIt ! HoId.
HoId it there.
A guard, Your Majesty.
Get away from there !
Come on. Move.
[ Sighing ]
- Go. Outta my way.
- Excuse me.
[ Groaning ]
[ Man ] You kiIIed the king.
You must die !
[ Crowd Booing ]
Let's go.
[ PeopIe YeIIing, Booing ]
[ Sniffing ]
Something stinks.
WeII, it's not me.
It's me.
[ Horn BIowing ]
[ Horn Continues ]
[ Tu ]
Ach, the stench !
I think the body's gone ripe.
It's a good thing we're burning it.
A bit more IiberaI with that incense.
May this dog suffer an eternity of pain.
- But not today !
- [ Crowd Screams ]
Stop him !
HopeIess.
Watch out !
- Head for the tempIe !
- This way ! This way !
Let's go ! Hurry !
Who is it ?
Who eIse ?
[ Laughs ]
You desire him.
- My passion burns, sIave.
- [ Screaming ]
CIose the gate !
[ KuII ]
Faster ! Get inside.
Hurry !
[ Indistinct YeIIing ]
Go, go, go !
- Out of my way.
- Don't Iet him out !
- [ Screaming ]
- [ KuII ] Keep going !
Not good.
[ Grunts ]
Damn !
Oh, shit !
[ YeIIing ]
Oof ! Ohh.
- The passage !
- Stop ! In the queen's name,
Iay down your arms.
In the king's name,
Iay down yours.
KuII Iives.
[ SoIdier Muttering ]
Your Majesty ! Sire !
Your Highness.
Get up ! I say to you,
KuII is dead.
And never again wiII a foreigner suIIy our throne. Impostor !
Traitor !
On your feet.
[ YeIIs ]
Go !
AscaIante !
- What are you doing ?
- I can't take a man's Iife.
- Now you teII me ?
- [ YeIIing ]
Put that down ! Go !
Go ! Go !
- Are you aII right ?
- I'm okay.
Hey ! Just who is this priest to you ?
My brother.
Brother ?
Her brother ? Good.
- Hyah ! Hyah !
- Hyah ! Hyah !
Are you deceitfuI or just cIumsy ?
You betrayed me.
He's not here.
You said he was dead !
Remember your pIace !
My pIace is on the throne.
What game is this you're pIaying ?
The dog knows a few tricks, that's aII.
Find him, kiII him, and then we'II ruIe together.
No. That was not part of our pact.
I have aItered our pact.
Pray I do not aIter it further.
Move out !
First we deaI with KuII.
Then we'II see her festering in her grave where she beIongs.
[ AscaIante ]
The port of TatheIi.
From here we must saiI north, find the IsIe of Ice and bring back the breath of VaIka.
The breath of VaIka is just a myth.
For centuries men have searched for it, but no man has ever found it.
- It doesn't exist.
- It does exist.
OnIy VaIka's breath can extinguish the fIame which fIows in Akivasha's veins.
If you faiI,
VaIusia is doomed.
Whoa.
- Stay here.
- [ Both ] Where are you going ?
To see an oId friend.
[ Men HaggIing ]
Excuse my partner.
H-He doesn't know what he is saying.
AII right. Yeah.
It's good.
Hey ! KuII ! KuII !
- They toId me you were dead.
- Uh, they tried.
But here I am, drinking your wine.
It's good wine too.
Oh, KuII, you haven't changed at aII, my friend.
Come, you buIging bag of muscIe and hair.
Come. TaIk to me.
Pucci, cocktaiIs.
It's good to see you, Juba.
Look at this pIace.
It's, uh, not Iike the oId days.
WeII, I've gotten rich off pirates Iike you.
You know what they say:
You can never have too much money... or too many good friends.
[ ChuckIes ]
I don't see any friends.
So, come on, KuII.
We're back in business, right ?
[ Sighs ]
I need a favor.
What do you want, a woman ?
Pucci !
- No.
- What, two women ?
- Ten women ?
- No women.
No women ? KuII !
Have you got a probIem ?
Juba.
I need a ship.
WeII, here she is, my fastest ship.
Take her, my friend.
She's yours.
Why don't you come with us ?
Oh, KuII, you know
I hate the smeII of fish.
I insist.
We have a Iot of catching up to do.
Captain.
SaiI north.
Wake up, scum !
Prepare to row !
The wind is up.
UnfurI the saiIs.
Do it.
Ship the oars !
Don saiIs !
[ Knocking ]
He saiIed from TatheIi, headed due north.
He seeks the IsIe of Ice.
He seeks the breath of VaIka.
No man has ever found it.
KuII is no ordinary man.
TaIigaro, you must stop him.
With my heIp, you can defeat him.
Now, first, you must prepare a ship.
Where do I saiI ?
Leave that to me.
Obey and you wiII share in gIories far beyond your earthIy ambitions.
- Yes ?
- Power, immortaIity.
Do my bidding.
Share my throne.
Yes, my Queen.
Bitch.
The breath of VaIka ! FooI.
The worId couId have been yours, KuII.
I couId have been yours.
[ Akivasha ]
BIow, winds of heIIfire !
BIow ! Send my swift destruction across the sea.
Oh !
[ Gagging ]
[ Laughing ]
Can I do anything for you ?
I'm fine.
Don't Iove where there's no hope, sister.
Food.
[ Grunts ] You ?
Come, my precious fIower.
You'II feeI better if you have something to eat.
You Iike fish eye ?
No fish eye.
Okay, bring on the meat.
Forget the hors d'oeuvres.
Come eat, my friends. Eat.
There's aIways pIenty to eat at Juba's.
Come and feast, my friends.
Forgive me, sire.
Where are my manners ?
Eating before the king.
Where are your brains ?
Eating before Juba.
What ? WeII, you think--
Oh, KuII, you're breakin' my heart.
You think I'd poison you ?
[ ChuckIing ]
Of course not.
- See, it's not deadIy.
It's just a IittIe dry.
- WeII, then, some wine to wash it down.
- AbsoIuteIy. To your heaIth.
- No, no, no.
To yours. Drink up.
[ Groaning ]
Come, my friends.
Don't be siIIy.
Eat, drink, fiII yourseIves.
Oh, KuII.
Things... have just not been the same... since you and I--
[ Groans ]
[ Groaning ]
It's okay, Zareta.
You'II get your sea Iegs in a day or two.
- [ Grunts ]
- [ Grunts ]
[ Juba ]
Hey ! Hey.
Come on. Come on.
Come on.
Ahh. FinaIIy awake.
Ohh.
[ Laughing ]
Oh. You got nice equipment.
Think I'II get a nice price for that.
WeII, you certainIy did make a pig of yourseIf Iast night.
By the way, the food was not poisoned. It was drugged.
Oh, your queen's gonna be happy to see you when we dock in VaIusia.
I think you're gonna make me a nice profit.
MeanwhiIe, you can earn your keep here at the oars.
I'm sure you can pick it up again in no time.
- What have you done with Zareta ?
- Oh, her.
Bring the fine young Iady.
Come. Bring her.
[ Muttering ]
- Yes, bring her.
Bring her, bring her, bring her.
- Let go of me.
Maybe I couId, uh, seII her too.
You know, I think she cIeans up very niceIy.
You dog !
Why, you--
You are not fit to wear a fine Iady's things.
DangIe her in the drink.
[ Screaming ]
[ Laughing ]
I'II kiII you.
I don't think so.
- Those ropes are strong.
- [ YeIIing ]
- Mmm.
- Pity your ship isn't.
Where's that sword ?
Where's that sword ?
[ YeIIing ]
KuII. KuII, come on. It's me.
No, I was jokin'. It was a joke.
Come on. Oh, boy, you shouId've seen your face.
You shouId see yours.
Ohh.
KuII !
PuII out the knife.
PuII it !
KuII ! I can't swim !
- I can't swim !
- Zareta !
Don't go anywhere !
Hang on !
- [ Crack ]
- [ Screaming ]
[ AII ]
Down here ! Down here !
Come on !
[ MetaI CIanging ]
[ Neck Cracking ]
Not bad, priest. No !
Zareta !
[ Groaning ]
- Where the heII have you been ?
- Busy.
Give me your hand.
Thuron ! Run our course.
SaiI north.
Aye, Tiger.
[ Laughing ]
Hey, KuII !
You can come back now !
- KuII !
- [ Men Screaming ]
## [ Fanfare ]
[ Crowd Murmuring ]
Citizens of VaIusia, rest assured that we wiII find the whore who murdered our beIoved king... and the impostor that keeps her from justice.
We wiII have their bIood !
[ Cheering ]
And know this:
KuII's Iegacy wiII not die.
I wiII Iead VaIusia into the future, and our kingdom shaII reign supreme !
[ Cheering ]
What's wrong ?
[ Enaros ] You squander your affections on unworthy men, when the one who brought you back from the dead... remains your devoted servant.
Enaros.
You forget your pIace.
[ Shuddering ]
[ Screaming ]
[ Screaming ]
The IsIe of Ice.
[ KuII ] The wind is up !
Raise the saiI !
- Man the oars !
- Man the oars !
[ Boatswain ]
Keep rowing !
She shouId be in regaI robes, not bearskins.
She wasn't born a sIave,
Your Majesty.
Borna sentenced me to death for heresy, but Zareta begged him for mercy.
She traded her virtue and freedom for my Iife.
[ KuII ]
Put some more torches on the deck !
[ Shouting, Indistinct ]
Keep your eyes open !
- [ Shivering ]
- Soon.
- [ Crashing ]
- [ YeIIing ]
- [ Wood SpIintering ]
AscaIante !
[ Men Groaning ]
Steer away !
[ KuII ]
The ships that never returned !
Give me your hand !
There ! The cave !
- AscaIante !
- I'm aII right.
VaIka !
KuII ! Look !
''What was faIse must be true.
Cause be the carrier of VaIka's might... to defy unhoIy fIame.''
What does it mean ?
AscaIante.
The praying maiden.
''Cause be the carrier.''
- Zareta !
- Zareta !
AscaIante ! Wait !
''Cause be the carrier.''
Akivasha was the cause !
A woman !
OnIy a woman wiII bring forth the breath of VaIka !
Tiger ! Tiger ! Tiger !
- [ Screaming ]
- KuII !
I kneeI before you, VaIka, to pray for your son KuII, whom I Iove, and though I am not pure, my Iove is strong.
Come, barbarian !
I'm yours.
[ Screaming ]
I see you've yet to master a nobIeman's bIade.
[ Groaning ]
[ Zareta ] Let me be the carrier of your might !
Let me extinguish the fIame that mocks your rage !
[ Gasping ]
Zareta !
Zareta, speak to me.
It is inside of her.
The breath of VaIka.
So... so coId.
Zareta. Zareta must stand in the fIame of Acheron.
That is how Akivasha wiII be vanquished.
You can't have her.
Hah !
[ Groaning ]
[ Fierce YeII ]
Huh ?
AscaIante !
Finish what you started, priest.
- [ Groaning ]
- No !
- [ Grunting ]
- No !
You can't win.
You aIready Iost !
Everyone and everything you hoId dear is doomed because of you-- an arrogant dog who wouId be king !
Come here !
Zareta !
KuII !
[ Gasping ]
[ Groans ]
AscaIante !
KuII, if Zareta dies, the breath of VaIka wiII be Iost forever, and VaIusia wiII become a Iiving heII.
She Ioves you very much.
Such Iove was wasted on a fooI !
I was bIinded by pride and greedy dreams of nobiIity, and now a kingdom wiII pay the price.
Let me Iook at you.
CoId to the touch.
Ah.
The fIame dies.
Ah, yes, the priest was right.
You wiII stand in the unhoIy fire untiI it burns no more.
- Take her away.
- Sir.
Now, I wiII destroy the Iying witch... and take my rightfuI pIace as king.
After aII we've done in VaIka's name, Iook.
Your god Iaughs at us.
[ Fierce YeII ]
[ YeIIing ]
Forgive me, VaIka.
[ YeIIing ]
[ Gasping ]
[ Banging, Door Bursting Open ]
- DucaIon.
- Your Majesty, your procIamation has caused unrest among the nobIes.
The nobIes ?
Did you reaIIy think I'd step down ?
Hmm ?
- What is this ?
- The future.
AII I wanted was to be king !
It was my right !
- Hmm.
- What did you dredge up out of heII ?
I have bartered my souI, and VaIusia is Iost.
Yes, and Acheron wiII be Acheron again.
The past wiII be restored.
I shaII make you the past.
Witch !
Hmm.
Enaros, heIp me.
- HeIp me !
- Not me, fooI.
[ Hissing ]
[ Screaming ]
[ Crowd CIamoring ]
- [ ExcIaiming ]
- [ Man ] What's happening ?
It is done, my Queen.
[ Moaning ]
- Mistress.
- It is time.
[ Gasps ]
KuII ?
KuII !
- ImpossibIe !
- No. Stop him ! KiII him !
Or suffer my wrath !
Sacred fIame, protect us from the coId !
Hurry, Mistress.
Cause be the carrier.
The Topaz Throne is mine, witch !
I take what is my due, and now I give you yours.
[ Shrieking ]
[ Screaming, Gasping ]
- The fIame does not die.
- No !
The fIame does not die !
[ CackIing ]
No, VaIka.
She must not die.
She must not die !
You're stiII a barbarian, KuII.
[ Groaning ]
[ Screaming ]
[ Demonic Voice ]
KuII !
You have faiIed, KuII !
You have aII faiIed !
The breath of VaIka has died with her, and in moments,
I wiII be invincibIe !
[ Roaring ]
[ Laughing ]
KuII !
A kiss. A kiss.
[ Shrieking ]
Husband.
[ Low GrowI ]
Husband.
Come kiss your bride.
Yes. A kiss.
[ Roaring ]
Husband.
You're so coId.
CoId !
[ Screaming ]
The fate of my kingdom wiII be found within a kiss !
[ Shrieks ]
- [ Groaning ]
- Back !
Her Iife for the crown !
Hey, hey, hey !
The crown !
[ Fierce YeII ]
[ Groaning ]
That's how a barbarian fights !
[ Crowd Cheering ]
Give me that.
[ GiggIing ]
PeopIe of VaIusia, now I give you your new king !
- [ Crowd ] HaiI !
- M-MiIord, miIord.
Sire ? Uh, sire, sire.
Uh, uh, uh, sire ?
AII sIaves of VaIusia are now free.
- [ Crowd Cheering ]
- Oh ! No, no, no !
But the Iaws ! Oh !
The Iaws ! The Iaws !
Take this.
- Move ! Move !
- The harem is dispersed.
The king commands no one's affections.
No.
Don't kneeI to me.
I shouId kneeI to you, my Queen.
A common girI, sir ?
- The woman I Iove.
- B-B-But, my Iiege, she's a-a--
- She is not of nobIe birth.
- Nor am I.
It's a good thing too.
From our Ioins, VaIusia wiII be reborn red-bIooded and strong.
But, miIord--
- Oh !
- If you don't Iike my kingship, come take the throne.
By this ax, I ruIe.
Long Iive the king !
Long Iive the king !
Long Iive the king !
Long Iive the king !
Long Iive the king !
Long Iive the king !
Long Iive the king !
Long Iive the king !
Long Iive the king !
Long Iive the king !
Long Iive the king !
I thought we were gonna play ball.
Come on.
Come on!
Stay, Bo-jay
Hey, Mr Higgins.
Did you see something come down ten minutes ago?
Yeah. It's in the clearing.
It's really incredible.
Come on, you have to come see it.
It's just through here.
- Sam. Great to see you. How are you?
- Mr Jarvis.
This is Dr Sefton.
- Mary. Hi.
- Sam. Hi.
- What the hell's he doing here?
- This is important, Sam.
- Sorry about the short notice.
- No problem.
They have their IDs?
So I'm a Cavanaugh now.
We're tourists. If anyone asks,
I'm Charles Cavanaugh.
Dr Sefton is your sister.
My sister?
Of whom you are extremely fond in a clean-cut, healthy, all-American way.
- Where's my sister been all my life?
- Dr Sefton is on loan from NASA.
Jarvis, get the trunk for me, will you?
Since when did the office start drafting civilians?
All you need to know is that in the scheme of things, she is much more valuable to us than you are.
I take it you're as valuable as ever?
Naturally.
So if you two are being shot at, which bullet do I take?
You must try for both, of course.
What's so important to draw you out of your office and into the field?
Something unusual was reported entering our atmosphere last night.
One of our Keyhole satellites picked this up.
- You wanna give me a hint?
- See the little blur, top left?
Yeah.
The analysts speculate that's where the UFO may have landed.
- That's all we have?
- We immediately sent in two agents.
Deitman and Truly.
They have not reported back and we have not been able to contact them.
Peripheral reports?
The usual ground sightings.
Reports of a landing.
Then a local TV station sent in a mobile unit to do a spot-cast.
And they reported that indeed a UFO had landed.
An hour later they changed their tune.
Claimed it was a hoax.
A fraud perpetrated by a couple of farm boys who built this spaceship.
Nice sign.
- You go ahead. I'll catch up.
- OK.
Tell me, Mary, what exactly do you do for NASA?
- My speciality's exobiology.
- Exobiology?
It's the study of what alien life forms might be like.
You make a living at that?
Seems it'd be mostly guesswork.
We used to joke in school that ours was the only science without a subject matter.
So you people are with the office of scientific intelligence.
Till two days ago
I hadn't heard of it.
You wouldn't have.
Our existence isn't public knowledge.
Eisenhower started O-SCI back in '59.
We're an offshoot of the CIA, but the old man runs it like his own private dictatorship.
- Pay for this, will you, Sam?
- Sure, Charles.
Three for the... flying saucer.
What do you hear, Sam?
No birds.
Right. No birds.
Care to see inside, sir?
Only a buck more.
That's a bargain.
Let's have a look, shall we?
Sure.
Hi.
Let's see... Three dollars.
There you go.
How much have you made so far?
About $320.
I'll go first.
Thanks.
Could you help me here?
Thanks.
Thank you.
Let's go, lady.
I'm trying to run a business here.
It doesn't look safe.
It is. We've been taking people through all day.
She balked at the Pirates of the Caribbean.
Come on.
Keep the money, guys.
We're running late.
Come on.
Come on.
Thanks, guys.
- Well, Charles?
- Wait a minute.
Couldn't see anything, but there was definitely something strange going on.
What about the burn marks?
The burn marks were real.
Something landed there, but not that thing.
Why that thing?
Why the cover-up? Go on, Mary.
There was something odd about those boys. And the men.
What, precisely?
I know this doesn't necessarily qualify as scientific evidence, but a woman is used to a certain response from men, and from those boys
I didn't even get the automatic...
When I was introduced to Sam, he did this.
I did not do that.
Based on what I was doing with my blouse, they should have tried to look down my top...
Wouldn't have had to try very hard.
We'll go to the TV station that broadcast those conflicting reports.
Try something and let me know if you get the same reaction.
- Yes.
- Let's go.
- I did that when we first met?
- You're still doing it.
- Stay by the car.
- I'll keep it up there and wait.
That's fine.
The FCC does not take misrepresentation lightly, Mr Barnes.
We made an explanation over the air.
What else do you want?
We fell victim to a practical joke.
It was a mistake.
We're only human, after all.
Damn. Could I borrow your pen?
Well, I've seen the site.
I find it difficult to imagine that a couple of farm boys could have pulled off a hoax like that on their own.
Are you implying that my station was in on it?
Be realistic.
Hold it!
He's still moving.
- My God!
- Well, well, well.
- What the hell is that?
- Our visitor, I presume.
Careful.
No! Sam!
I want to take it back.
Give me that case.
Thank you for your cooperation,
Mr Barnes.
We will be in touch with you as soon as I complete the investigation.
They're on their way right now.
Let's go, Sam.
Sorry.
This way.
Billy, they're coming through.
Stop them, Billy.
... you can stay calm, those around you will react...
Especially if you have children.
Once...
Could I see some ID, please, sir?
Sam, you drive. Jarvis, get in the car.
Get away from the car, officer.
Get in the car.
He's on the car, Sam!
Get out!
- Get out.
- Get him off!
Get him off.
It's the kid from the spaceship.
- Get him off the car.
- Jarvis, help him.
My God.
- Sam. You all right?
- Yeah, I'm all right.
Make sure Langley understands we must stop this before it spreads.
I want that town sealed up completely.
Put up perimeter roadblocks...
Not local police.
They have been compromised.
Right?
The troops you send in must put up a challenge at 100 yards and shoot anyone who comes closer than 50 yards.
Get Holland to take a hazard response team and investigate the landing site.
There is no time to waste...
- Thanks.
- Sure.
We should exercise extreme caution.
It wasn't supposed to happen like this.
What wasn't?
First contact.
What did you expect? ET?
No, but it would have been nice.
I never liked that little troll.
He's in his element. He's only really happy during a crisis.
Yeah. Alive.
A little tense between you two?
Yeah, well, he's my father.
This is incredible.
- Graves.
- Quite incredible.
Plenty of time for amazement later.
Right now I need facts.
OK, here's one. It's dead.
Are you sure?
No body heat, no electrical activity and no movement.
If we vented the chamber, it'd be pretty ripe in there.
We gave it quite a jolt of electrical current.
Probably vascular collapse, although most parasites, when separated...
Dr Sefton will define what we're dealing with.
Right. How do you want to handle this?
We need to know how the creature interfaces with our nervous system.
We should split into teams, each focusing on a different aspect of the alien.
Biochemistry, physiology, reproduction.
- Endocrinology...
- Wait a minute.
What we need to know is who we're fighting and how to fight them.
Is that clear to both of you?
It's one o'clock. In two hours
I'm calling a meeting at the office.
Make sure you have something for me by then.
Brad, cover.
OK, Jim, tape this.
And get a water sample.
I'll be damned.
- Do you want me to wait?
- No. I'll check you out later.
- Any trouble in Iowa?
- Not like you people had.
I heard you had to take a couple of people out.
These weren't people any more.
You shoot, they just keep on coming.
Any word on Deitman and Truly?
- Has anyone told their wives yet?
- Not yet.
So what are we looking at here?
It seemed something organic had eaten its way into the earth below the water table.
Now, whatever was hiding in that fake saucer was moved.
A hole filled with water was left.
What's your guess? How many of those things could have been in that hole?
Based on the size of the cavity, could have been thousands.
I don't know if this counts for anything, but... that kid said 320 people had gone through that ship about 11 hours ago.
What's the population of Ambrose?
- All right, Mary, let's go.
- OK.
Please keep in mind we were a little rushed.
Here's the creature, with an incision along its ventral surface.
The first thing that stands out is the complexity of its neo-cortex.
In a human, brain tissue accounts for about 5%% of total body mass.
But in this creature, and here's the brain tissue, it accounts for about 60%% .
This black tentacle, which we saw jet across Barnes's office, contains a probe. An interface between the creature and its host.
The probe penetrates the brain while these hooks here and here lock into the spinal column.
Together they override the human nervous system.
Wait. Are you saying that these slugs are using us like puppets?
Exactly.
You didn't mention whether the creature has eyes. Does it?
We haven't been able to locate any sensory organs.
Anything else?
We found human DNA and protein inside the creature.
They're able to adapt to whichever life form they're riding on.
We breathe oxygen so they breathe oxygen.
The two systems merge.
Can't we exploit this potential weakness?
What affects the host might also affect the parasite.
We must find something they're vulnerable to and we're not.
The people being ridden seemed stronger than normal.
We think they boost adrenaline production into their host.
Like injecting nitro into a car's fuel line.
The car will run faster but the engine will burn out sooner.
It's really quite a remarkable organism.
Much more efficient than anything on earth.
Look how elegant the cartilaginous structure is.
Incredible. It doesn't use haemoglobin in oxygen transport.
It uses a chlorophyll derivative.
Jeez, Graves. He sounds like he wants to fuck the thing.
Shut up, Holland.
Dr Sefton, do you have any idea how we should proceed?
This was a preliminary postmortem...
When did you quit smoking?
- Must have left them in the car.
- Stop him!
Jesus. He's got one on him!
Security!
Alex, go upstairs!
Secure the exit.
Bonnie, call 334, main gate.
- Come on, upstairs.
- Main gate.
Alex!
- Where is it?
- I don't know.
- Harris, get a medic.
- Right.
- Sam?
- We got him.
I guess that thing jumped onto whoever it ran into.
Put your gun down, Sam. Slowly.
Take off your shirt.
Thank you.
Well, let's find it.
Search everybody.
Right, everyone's accounted for.
- One of the aliens...
- This was on Jarvis.
It contains every emergency contingency we've drawn up since '59.
One of the alien life forms is loose in the building.
We have to presume that it's riding on the back of one of us.
Sam, show them your back.
Sam is clean.
Holland. Gorman.
Miss Haines. Everybody.
Miss Haines. Everybody.
What about you, sir?
Yeah, she's right. You're not exempt.
Stop her!
Gannet, Beasley, come on!
Miss Haines!
Miss Haines! Come back here!
Let go of me!
- They're down in the kitchen.
- Hurry up! Let's go down!
Damn! I lost it!
Forget it. Forget it.
I lost it.
It was too quick.
It went up through there.
I want that thing found tonight.
Turn the building upside down, but find it.
- Miss Haines?
- Sam, get cleaned up.
I want every second of Jarvis's time accounted for.
I want to know everything he was up to since we left Iowa.
Go and get a medic, will you?
God...
He's been like this since you brought him in.
In many ways he's exhibiting classic withdrawal symptoms, much like you'd find in a drug addict.
Are you saying he was actually addicted to having that thing on him?
No, he's saying that the presence of the thing satisfies some need or other.
Thanks, doc.
Jarvis is cold turkey and Miss Haines is in a coma.
- All victims will react this way?
- How would you react?
One minute you have this huge brain, the next moment you don't.
Think of it.
It'd be a lot easier if they had a live specimen to work with.
- What do you think these things are?
- Let's have a look.
They almost look like antennae.
What are they receiving?
Or transmitting, for that matter.
Radar, maybe. Or sonar signals, like bats.
Do you think that's how the aliens are able to recognise each other?
Yeah?
- You're the manager of the building?
- Yeah. Can I help you?
I need to get inside the apartment of Neil Jarvis.
Yeah, sure.
Just a second.
I'll be right with you.
Do you have a crowbar?
No, I got the keys.
Up this way.
Anybody here?
Hello?
These arrived this morning for
Mr Jarvis.
- I let the delivery people in.
- Give me a hand.
Yeah, sure.
Iowa. I wonder what that's all about.
What the hell are those things?
The president's scheduled appearance at the digital age conference
has drawn harsh criticism from Senator Allen,
who categorised the visit as blatant grandstanding.
Make sure the magnetometer's cranked up early. We don't want delays.
Has headquarters given us the name of our post standers?
Yes.
I need more agents on that balcony.
- And all along this perimeter.
- OK.
Long time no see.
Good to see you, Bruce. This is
Evan Greenberg, one of my agents.
- How are you, Evan?
- Hi.
What brings you down here?
I understand the president is scheduled to appear here.
If everything goes as planned.
There's a situation developing that I think you need to know about.
Can we talk in private?
Yeah. Come on.
OK. Now, Sam, what's this all about?
What the hell are you doing?
Please take your seats. The opening session is about to begin.
- Good to see you.
- Welcome, Mr President. This way.
Get him.
Alpha One, he's headed your way.
Watch where you're going.
Bruce, will you tell me what's happening here, please?
Clear?
Dead.
Are you all right, sir?
Andrew.
What in God's name is going on?
Damn! There! There he is!
Stop! Hold it!
Stop!
Again.
Watch out!
Hold up.
Jesus, that was close.
- You think he would have shot me?
- Of course he would.
Get him to the lab.
What does all this mean?
Top line is Sam's heart rate.
Bottom is the alien's.
They're identical. Brain waves too.
Their nervous systems are linked.
Pulse is 120. Blood pressure
140l90.Temperature 103.
Creature's running him hot.
Move the fluoroscope to the right profile, please.
What's this?
An electromagnetic signal. At first we thought it was just interference.
It seems to be coming from the parasite.
- You were right, then. Radar.
- Yeah.
- Let me hear it.
- It's too high a frequency.
Wake him up. I'm going in there.
Sir, it's not a good idea.
I don't think it's safe in there.
It's Sam, Lawrence.
- Sir?
- It's all right.
Wake him up, Jim.
Bring me that stool.
Can you hear me?
Sam isn't here any more, Andrew.
You know me?
And your dead wife.
And Mary.
You wouldn't believe the fantasies my host has about you, Mary.
- Would you like me to tell you?
- No, we would not.
I will ask the questions, and if you do not cooperate,
I'll administer electric shocks and you will die.
I will stop the heart of this host and it will die.
Get him back!
- He's gone flatline!
- 2cc of ephinephrine!
2cc of ephinephrine, stat.
It's back.
Hold that ephinephrine.
My God, it has total control.
Sam, why have they come here?
What do they want?
I warned you.
Shock it.
I acknowledge you can hurt me, but each shock shortens your son's life.
Do you understand?
Of course I understand.
Now you answer me.
Why are you here?
Our previous hosts ceased to be useful.
You are stronger than they were.
You will last longer.
Right. How many are you?
One.
There may be semantic differences.
Its concept of identity may be different.
No.
No.
How many are you?
One.
Sam, do you have any idea how many of them there are?
It was thinking "one".
It doesn't know why you keep...
Always giving orders, aren't you,
Andrew?
Always telling people how to run their lives.
Maybe that's why you're so Ionely.
Did you ever think of that?
Maybe that's why your son resents you so much.
You won't be Ionely when you're one of us. No-one will be.
For God's sake, tell us what you want.
Peace.
Say goodbye to your son, Andrew.
Jesus. It's killing him.
Get it off him!
It's gone.
Welcome back.
I'm sorry you had to go through that, son.
Those things I said, Dad.
- It wasn't me talking.
- Come on.
Do you remember what happened?
I was aware. I was conscious of what
I was doing and what was happening.
It was like having one of those dreams when you're paralysed.
No matter how much I tried to move or scream, I just couldn't.
It had total control over me.
I was like an open book to them.
They could read everything in my mind. My thoughts, fears, memories.
Did they have thoughts?
I remember something about...
...their ship...
It wasn't a ship, though.
It was like a nerve centre.
A hive.
Had to get back to it...
...to share information with the others.
You know where it is? Do you?
I'm not sure where, really.
Get some rest.
Get some rest.
Let me know as soon as
I can try again.
Say goodbye to your son, Andrew.
That's enough of that. Take it off.
Sir.
The parasites run their hosts at a high body temperature, which gives them an identifiable heat signature.
We have been able to track that heat signature through thermal imaging from satellite sweeps and reconnaissance.
Run the RPV recording.
This is Ambrose, and those red areas are creature-controlled.
Give me maximum magnification here, please.
I want to show you something.
These are human beings with creatures on their back.
- What's the green dot?
- A human being without a creature.
He's surrounded by parasite-controlled hosts.
And now he too has a parasite on his back.
I'm not... I'm not coming.
I'm sorry, Dad.
Get this off me.
Everybody, just get off of me.
It's OK.
- Get it off me!
- It's not on you any more.
It's not on you any more.
OK? You're OK.
- You're OK.
- I can still feel it.
It's gone. It's gone.
You're all right.
Have we been in contact with the governor?
What about the Iowa National Guard?
They will have been infiltrated.
You have to go in on a federal level.
Our nearest troops are the first infantry division at Fort Riley.
- How quickly can we move on this?
- You'll have a force in 12 hours.
I recommend we go in at night to take advantage of the thermal imaging.
Do it.
Wait. I see something.
We're going in.
Go.
Shit.
- Gentlemen.
- What's this?
- This is a thermal image feed.
- It's from Lieutenant Abbey's unit.
They're using children?
You cannot think of them as children.
They are the enemy.
General?
- They're here to see you, sir.
- In the office. I'll be in soon.
This way, men.
We've lost satellite link-up, but we have Lieutenant Abbey on audio.
The situation's under control now.
We'll bring the children into the holding area
then move on to sector seven.
Thank you.
So far so good.
What's going on in here?
Captain Earley, sir.
Iowa National Guard, Camp Dodge.
We're here to provide backup.
I didn't hear anything about you being called in.
- Get me Washington on the line.
- I'd rather you didn't.
Did you find a way to kill them?
No, not yet. We're trying everything.
Different bacteria, viruses, radiation.
But so far we've found nothing that doesn't kill the host.
See the one looking at us? He's wearing the slug we took off you.
They've been sitting like that for hours.
Yeah, they're merging. It's how they communicate with each other.
- Yeah?
- They exchange chemical signatures.
We're ready, Dr Graves.
We should have thought of that.
Ants communicate in the same way.
Where did you get the second parasite?
Just watch.
We set up a keyboard in case they want to talk to us.
Vargas, note the time.
- Does the old man know about this?
- He wanted to make sure.
Here we go again.
This is how they reproduce.
A second adult parasite in minutes.
Vargas, get the old man on the line.
Watch what they do to the little one.
The new one knows me.
I've got General Morgan reporting in.
Andrew Nivens here, general.
How is it going down there?
It was touch and go for a while, but we think the worst is over now.
- It's your son.
- Hang on, Sam.
We've got 70%% % of the area contained
- and kept casualties fairly low.
- Thank you.
Would you take off your shirt and turn your back to the camera?
- Is this a joke?
- No, it's not. Take off your shirt.
I don't take my orders from you.
Order him to take off his shirt. Sam, go on.
I'm sorry, general. Would you humour us for a moment, please?
God.
- There's no signal coming in.
- What's going on?
The transmission isn't lost.
The transmission has been cut because
General Morgan has been taken, and we can assume that his troops are now our enemy.
We're getting reports that the situation's been contained.
The reports are faked.
We're being manipulated.
I have just been told that their numbers are increasing infinitely more than anticipated.
We've lost a town, sir.
Now we've lost an army.
They're capable of transmitting not just intelligence but memory from one body to the next by coming into physical contact.
The new one knew Sam as if it had been the one on his back?
Yes.
How long does it take it to prepare for division?
12 hours. Let's assume we started with 1,000 of them.
We'll be conservative.
That's one day, 4,000.
Two days, 16,000.
- In two weeks there would be...
- More than 250 billion.
You OK?
I don't know why your father picked me.
- I won't be able to find the answer.
- Wait.
He knows what he's doing.
You'll find something.
No, Mary, you will.
Thanks, Sam.
He's given everyone a few hours off to recuperate.
I don't have time to go to the hotel.
I'll go back to the lab.
No, I...
I just live a few blocks from here.
OK.
That wasn't very friendly.
I wouldn't take it personally.
He's kind of a prima donna.
- How about if I make a fire?
- That'd be great.
Is that OK for him to go out like that?
Yeah, yeah. He comes and goes.
- Is this your mom?
- Yeah.
She's pretty.
She died about a year after that picture was taken.
What was it like growing up with him?
- Boot camp.
- I'll bet.
Whenever he was working at home, he'd give me a quarter for every hour I could keep quiet.
One day, I remember it was... it was a Saturday morning.
I decided I wouldn't say anything until he did, even if it took all weekend.
But he never said anything.
I don't think he even noticed.
So how much did you make?
About 12 bucks.
Shit.
It's the old man.
Yeah.
Yeah, she's here with me.
Yeah. OK.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I just dropped the phone.
Look who turned out to be a sweetie after all.
So?
So we have to go back.
Maybe we could stay another... ten minutes.
Don't move.
Why did you do that, Sam?
What's the matter, Sam?
Isn't this what you wanted from the day we met?
You and I together.
You can't hurt her, can you?
But I can.
Mary got it off your cat? Jesus.
They've taken her back to their hive,
I'm positive.
If they've taken her back there, there's nothing we can do about her.
I'm going after her.
No, you're not.
It's a suicide mission.
You don't understand the enemy.
I won't have you on the casualty list.
I have to find the hive, get inside and get information.
In 12 hours that area will be a war zone. You're not thinking rationally.
Dad, I'm sick of thinking rationally.
I'm going after her!
Do you intend to help me or not?
It's receiving OK.
Minneapolis has been invaded.
Civil authorities are fighting to keep the situation under control,
but they are not having much luck.
It's good, but the frequency still isn't matching.
What safeguards can be taken to protect you and your family?
Keep your doors and windows locked.
Don't let anyone into your home, even if they appear to be a friend.
If you absolutely have to venture outside...
OK, can we get started?
Stay tuned to this station for further updates.
There's some sort of a hive that they have to go back to regularly.
Central source.
Intelligence replenishing.
Exactly.
OK, let's run this.
I've had the analysts sort through the thermal image data we've gathered in order to plot the expansion of the alien colony.
This is a satellite picture of Iowa when the UFO was sighted.
Here. Day 1. Now watch.
The orange shape represents the spread of the colony over five days.
Now, what you'd expect, if it's necessary to stay close to the hive, with Iowa's topography, is that the shape would be roughly circular.
So we rationalised it into three overlapping circles.
Could you do that, please?
If we shrink these circles back, we find the location of the hive at different times.
Each time the hive is on the river.
That could be how they moved it.
All right. This is where it all started.
This is where the hive is now.
Des Moines.
Makes sense. High population density.
And it'd be easier to defend.
We've narrowed its location to a ten-block radius in the city centre.
That's where Mary is. I know it.
Show me the projected size of the colony in the next 24 hours.
We'll parachute in tonight.
- We have six hours.
- We'll need eight.
You've got eight hours.
You've got a very tight eight-hour window to pull this off.
- After that you're on your own.
- Yes.
- Opening drill.
- Look, reach, pull.
Good.
Wait up!
I just want to tell you we jerry-rigged these transmitters so they send out the same frequency as the aliens.
It's how they recognise each other.
If you don't get too close, they'll think you're one of them.
- Beautiful.
- Nice.
- Thanks, Graves.
- Thanks.
Hey, Graves, I think you're a genius, man.
I just want to apologise for that comment I made back in the room.
About you fucking the thing.
- Let's go!
- I didn't mean it.
- Thanks. Thanks.
- Good luck.
...choppers. We'll have to use army vehicles and supply them here.
We have to cover this terrain...
Danny?
Somebody help!
Forget it, Alex.
No!
Jesus, I don't wanna end up like that.
- Trapped inside my own body.
- Come on.
He wants to merge.
Remind me to thank Graves.
The president's announcement has sent shock waves throughout the country.
They should be at the city centre now, sir.
... have been filtering in from virtually every state.
In response, the president has declared a state of emergency,
instituting martial law in all major urban centres.
In related news, the financial world...
All units designated primary and secondary to proceed to level P2.
All other units should assemble on the first floor.
- This has to be it.
- Let's go around back.
It's down there.
- I should be going with you.
- Just give me 20 minutes.
How will I know it's really you?
If it's not, you know what to do.
Share information... with the others.
Sam, why are they here?
What do they want?
My thoughts, my fears.
My memories.
You won't be lonely when you're one of us.
No-one will be.
It's everything you try to hide from yourself.
Isn't this what you always wanted?
You wouldn't need the fantasies that life was just about you.
You and I, together.
You can't hurt her, can you?
- It's not on him.
- Get it off me!
But I can.
Get it off me!
Don't move, don't move.
Fuck.
You all right?
There's something you've gotta see.
It's important, Sam.
Wait.
Stay close to me.
This is why they wanted me.
Jesus, Mary, what is this place?
While we've been studying them, they've been studying us.
More dead bodies. Great.
Can we get out of here?
He's alive!
Get him out of there!
This is what we want. Something killed the parasite but not the boy.
Why did it die?
He must have contracted something fatal to his parasite.
He was sealed off in here so he wouldn't infect the others.
This is it.
Come on.
That's Alex. Take the kid.
Alex! I got him! Let's go!
Help!
Come on!
We can't help him. Come on.
Come on.
You gotta get up on the roof. Go.
This'll keep them busy.
Code eight. All units to South Plaza.
Main power supply.
- Can you stand up?
- Yeah.
Do you think you can walk?
They'll pick us up on the roof.
They're coming.
Go!
Come on!
- Take the kid.
- OK. I got him.
You weren't planning on leaving without me, were you, buddy?
Go. Get him to the roof.
Let's talk about it, Alex.
Here, kitty-kitty.
I'll talk to you, Sam.
I know you're in here.
If I have to look for you too long, it's gonna really piss me off.
Where are you, you lousy son of a bitch?
You said you'd help me.
You're no better than your father.
Help me!
God!
Come on!
- Alex, man, fight it!
- Yaaagh!
Fight it, man! Fight it!
How could he, Sam? You couldn't.
Don't leave me!
- Please, Sam, get it off!
- Alex?
- Alex!
- Get it off!
Not very smart, are you, Sam?
Pick him up. Bring him here.
It's safe. Come on!
Where are the others?
You never did have a right hand.
Come here.
We gotta go. Where's Holland?
He didn't make it.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
Get Nivens on the radio.
The boy has encephalitis, which causes inflammation of the brain.
It's not fatal to humans if it's treated in a few days, but the aliens are 60%% brain matter, so it should kill them first, allowing us to save the host.
- How long has it been?
- 33 minutes.
There's still the question of disease vectors. How it would spread.
Mosquitoes.
Yes.
Mosquitoes.
We could release infected batches over the areas controlled by aliens.
Wait.
Jesus.
It's disgusting.
33 minutes, 18 seconds.
That's it. We've done it.
Yes, but how do we get to them all?
They've spread so far.
We don't need to.
There's only one alien.
We've been thinking of millions. It's one creature with a million parts.
The same way they transmit information, they'll transmit the disease.
A chain reaction. We can infect the colony as if it were one body.
Perfect.
We've got General Morgan coming in from Fort Riley.
Bring the camera over here, please.
Well, we're all clean, sir.
It seems to be working.
The medics are administering the antitoxin throughout the area.
Most of my men are sick as hell, but the aliens are dying.
O1 to P3. All clear.
Anything?
Yes.
Yeah. They're on their way down?
Good.
All clear down here.
What were they trying to do here?
Rebuild their home.
Careful, sir.
My God!
Everybody OK down there?
Soldier, down here.
You OK?
I'm fine. Sorry. It was silly of me.
I should have been more careful.
Check him out, please.
He's clean.
- Sorry, sir...
- No, please don't apologise.
We'll need to take samples of the structure.
It's a pity we couldn't save it.
What we might have learned...
Well, I've seen enough.
Thank you.
I don't think I would have believed it was really over.
How you doing?
I can't believe
I slept for two days.
Excuse me, sir.
Dr Nivens forgot his cane.
Give me a hand up.
- There you go.
- Thanks very much.
Thank you.
Come on, soldier. On the double.
Move!
Call in emergency services now.
Hello, Sam.
I can fly a helicopter.
Perfectly.
You never told me how good it felt.
I had no idea man could feel such a sense of freedom.
- My God!
- When did you take him?
- Back in the ship.
- We checked.
I explained we had to lower my body temperature, so we did.
- We learn from our mistakes.
- I want you to land this helicopter.
Or what?
A gun.
Automatic pilot.
What are you going to do?
Do you think that you are capable of killing your father?
He'd want me to.
Possibly.
But the question is, can you?
Give me...
But you can't win.
Give it up.
Stand back.
You guys come with me.
Dad?
Come on, man. Don't do this to me.
Don't do this to me! Dad!
Stop shouting, Sam, for God's sake.
You know how much I hate it.
I got it. I got it.
I can't believe you actually shot me.
What would you have done?
I would have shot you, of course, but...
I never dreamed you were that kind of man.
Get outta here, Sam. I'm fine.
- It's OK, I'm going with you.
- No. Take her for a cup of coffee.
Exercise a fantasy.
OK, Dad.
That was the last one.
You don't know that.
- Yes, I do.
- Excuse me.
Have a good time.
I guess you exobiologists finally earned your keep.
Yeah, I guess.
When I was inside that thing, it was like hearing a thousand voices inside my head.
Yeah, I know.
You were there.
Your memories, your thoughts, feelings.
Everything you try to hide from yourself.
Yeah.
I guess you know how I feel about you, then.
Down to the last gory detail.
- Gives you an unfair advantage.
- Why's that?
It would take me forever to learn that much about you.
No, I think actually it helps us.
If you look at it from a sociological point of view, you could argue that men take a lot longer to open up than women do.
So you should be right on track in about 40 or 50 years.

Not That Stupid Old Fool.
Look, I Have Arthur
Exactly Where I Want Him.
The Black Knight's Working
His Magic Wonderfully.
We Do Not Need Interlopers
Like This Little Boy Spoiling It.
Now You Are
My High Chamberlain.
Deal With It!
Dost Thou Know
Who I Am, Lad?
Um, The King?
That's Right, Lad.
I Am King Arthur.
Cool.
Cool? Ah.
[Snaps Fingers]
[All Laughing]
Ah!
<I>[Laughter Continues]</I>
Your Highness.
[Stubs Toe]
Oh!
It's Obvious This Boy Is In
League With The Black Knight.
<I>[Cal] Who Me?
No! No, I'm Not!</I>
He's Nothing But A Common Spy And A Little Thief!
I Don't Know How I Got Here, Your Honor,
But I'm Not A Spy-- Or A Thief.
Thou Has Been Challenged, Lad.
<I>Step Up And
Prove Thyself Worthy.</I>
Of Course, The, Uh, The Boy May Be Allowed
To Choose The Mode Of Combat, Hmm?
Combat?
Can We Talk About This For A Minute?
Oh, Wake Up.
This Isn't
A Dream.
Quite Right.
It's Your Worst Nightmare
Come True.
Choose.
[Muttering]
Mode Of Combat.
I Gotta Choose A Weapon.
Oh, My God. I Gotta Choose.
I Gotta Choose.
I Choose Combat Rock.
<I>- Huh?
- [Guests Murmuring]</I>
- Here Goes.
- ♪♪ [Rock Blaring]
♪♪ [Music Stops]
[Man Exclaiming]
- 'Tis A Miracle.
- In Full-Blown Digital Stereo.
I Never Heard Such A Clamor In All My Days.
That Was No Clamor.
That Was Rock And Roll.
Come. Sit Here, Lad.
<I>Now Tell Me: What Do They Call Thee, Boy,
And From Whence Doth Thou Hail?</I>
Uh, Calvin Fuller, Sir.
From Reseda.
Oh!
[Chuckling] Knights And Ladies,
I Give Thee...
Calvin Fuller Of Reseda!
Calvin Fuller
Of Reseda!
Calvin Fuller
Of Reseda!
Well, Now, Let Us Eat.
[Guests Chattering]
Oh. Looks Real Good.
- What Is It? - Braised Boar's Snout With Haggis.
Come On. Eat Up, Boy.
I Heard What Transpired Between
Thee And The Black Knight.
Who Is This
Black Knight Guy Anyway?
A Scoundrel!
His Mission Is To Bring Down My Father's Kingdom.
Eat. It Loses Its Bouquet
When It Is Taken Cold.
<I>[Whimpering, Panting]</I>
<I>[Arthur]
Hmm, He's Got A Good Cut.</I>
Say, Where's Merlin?
When Does He Show Up?
Sadly, Merlin Passed Away
Many Years Ago.
<I>Your Highness?</I>
[Garbled]
Yes, Lad?
I Don't Mean To Butt In Here,
But Where's The Round Table?
- Round Table? - You Know,
Where You And Your Knights Have Your Meetings.
<I>It's Round So You Gotta Look Everybody In The Eye.
No Favorites. Everybody's Equal.</I>
Everybody's Equal?
[Laughing] Fascinating Idea.
- Where Did You Say You Were From?
- Uh, Reseda.
Reseda.
What An Odd Name.
Hey, It's The Bowling
Capital Of The World.
May I Suggest For Our Honored
Visitor From Reseda...
A Fortnight Of Training
With Master Kane?
<I>Oh, A Splendid Idea, Daughter.
Tomorrow, My Master At Arms...</I>
Shall Instruct Thee In The Ways
Of The Knights Of Camelot.
Prepare His Quarters!
Come On!
[Belches, Slurps]
Welcome To
Camelot, Sir.
Thanks... I Think.
Okay, Where's The Bathroom?
Lord Elastic!
Belasco.
Right.
Listen.
[Whispering]
What?
I Don't Hear Anything.
Exactly!
I Could Choke The Life
Right Out Of You Right Now.
No One Would
Hear You Scream.
Hold That Thought.
[Creaking]
[Kiai]
Hyah!
Oh! Excuse Me, Good Sir.
Pardon My Intrusion.
My Father Asked That I Make Sure Thou
Art Comfortable In Thy New Quarters.
You Want Me Comfortable, How About Getting
Me A Road Map Out Of The Middle Ages?
If I Don't Get Home,
I'm Grounded.
You Resedians Wear
Very Strange Garments.
Oh! Excuse Me.
Okay.
<I>Wait. Your Father
Sent You Here?</I>
[Murmuring]
I Cannot Lie To Thee, Sir. My Father Knows
Nothing Of My Nocturnal Transgression.
Do Me A Favor.
Call Me "Calvin."
Calvin.
That Dance.
What Was It?
<I>Dance?</I>
You Know.
Oh. That's Not A Dance.
That's Karate.
You See, There Was This Big Kid Who Was Beating
Me Up Every Day And Stealing My Lunch Money,
So My Dad Signed Me Up
For Karate School.
I Really Miss Them.
My Sister Too.
You Have No Idea What I'm Talking About,
Do You?
I Fear I Know Nothing Of
Karate Or Lunch Money,
But I Do Know What It Is Like To Miss One's Parents.
My Father Has Never Been
The Same Since Mother Died.
I Miss My Mother Deeply.
I Miss My Father Even More.
I Really Need To Get Home, Katey.
Can You Help Me?
I Truly Cannot.
Perhaps There Is
Somebody Who Can!
- Who?
- Merlin.
- But You Said He Was Dead.
- Not Quite.
<I>[Rock Moving]</I>
<I>Cool.
A Secret Door.</I>
Come.
[Rumbling]
This Way.
<I>[Wind Whistling]</I>
We've Lost The Light!
[Chuckles]
No Problem.
It's Incredible!
<I>[Cal] Just Like The Temple Of Doom.</I>
This Is It.
<I>[Stones Creaking]</I>
These Were Once Merlin's Quarters.
'Tis Now My Father's Private Sanctuary.
<I>[Cal] Is That-- Aw, It Can't Be.</I>
Oh, That. That's Just
Father's Old Sword.
"Old Sword"?
That's Excalibur.
My, Thou Dost
Know A Lot.
I Watch A Lot Of Cnn.
No One's Touched It
In Years.
'Tis True.
Wow, You Even Have
A Hot Tub.
'Tis The Well Of Destiny.
Oh.
That Is All That
Remains Of Merlin.
If There Is A Way Home,
It Will Be In There.
Sweet.
Quick.
Someone Comes. Hurry!
Here Is Where
We Must Part.
There's Something Very Special About You,
Calvin Of Reseda.
Perhaps Your Arrival Here
Was No Accident.
Hey, How Do I Get Back?
Follow The Wall.
It Stops At Your Quarters.
Good Night, Sir.
<I>Ah, The Knight I Sent For.</I>
<I>Come To The Well So That I May
Gaze Upon The Face Of Greatness.</I>
Who Said That?
<I>Come.
Come.</I>
<I>We Haven't Much Time.</I>
Is Someone Down There?
What Are You Doing Here, Boy?
Stand Aside So I May See My Great Warrior.
<I>Where Is He? Come, Come.
Step Forward.</I>
Um, I Hate To Tell You This,
But I'm The Only One Here.
- You Must Be Joking.
- No.
You're Merlin, Right?
Something Has Gone Horribly Wrong.
What Was That Wretched Spell I Cast?
Half A Quart Of Pig Vomit
And The Two Monkey Bladders?
- Pig Vomit?
- Or Was It The Other Way Around?
Good Lord!
<I>Oh, I Get It.</I>
This Is All A Big Mistake. That's Okay.
Everybody Picks Me Last.
No, I Couldn't Have Got It Wrong.
But Look At You!
<I>What Manner Of Armor Is That?
And That Animal Sleeping On Your Head.</I>
Animal?
It's My Hair!
Look, Your Wetness,
I Don't Understand Any Of This.
- And What Am I Doing Here?
- I Brought You Here...
To Save Camelot.
<I>- Me? - Arthur Is In Trouble.
His Kingdom Has Been Shattered...</I>
By The Iron Fist
Of Lord Belasco.
Oh, The Dork In The Purple Dress.
We've Met.
And You Haven't Seen The Last Of Him.
He Is A Dangerous Man.
<I>He Means To Steal Camelot
From Arthur. And You...</I>
Are Going To Stop Him.
Look, You Definitely
Have The Wrong Guy.
Why Don't You Just Send Me Home?
I Mean, My Family Really Needs Me.
Camelot Needs You!
[Groaning]
Help Arthur
Find His Way Back,
And I Will Help You
Find Yours.
[Sighs]
[Battle Cry,
Shield Clanging]
Nicely Done.
Thank You.
Now, Would You Care To Show
Us How It Is Done In Reseda?
Uh, Actually I Was
Hoping For A Desk Job.
<I>As From Today,
You're A Knight In Training.</I>
Thanks, But I Won't
Be Here That Long.
<I>Don't Tell Me...</I>
A Brave Lad Like You,
Who Faced The Full Fury Of The Black Knight,
Is Afraid Of A Dummy.
Uh, No Way.
I Was Just Testing You.
[Clangs]
God, These Things Are A Lot
Heavier Than They Look On Tv.
"Tv"? One Of Your Knights Of Reseda,
No Doubt?
Uh, Something Like That.
Good Fit.
Can You See?
Perfectly.
Oh, It Smells Like
Something Died In Here.
Excuse Me.
[Grunting]
<I>- [Kane] This Way.
- [Cal] Yeah, I Knew That.</I>
There. Whoa!
Calvin?
Yeah?
Remember Three Things:
Lean In.
Protect Your Steed.
Fix A Point On Your Opponent's
Person And Have At Him.
That's Four Things.
What?
Never Mind.
Hit It.
Ah!
<I>[Splashing]</I>
<I>Well, I'd Like To See
You Try That.</I>
I Thought All Knights Spent Their Time
Rescuing Damsels And Fighting Dragons.
What Are They All
Doing Here?
They're All Training Hard
For The Big Tournament.
You See,
The Prize Is Quite Appealing To All Men Of Royal Blood.
Really?
What's The Prize?
My Sister.
And Camelot.
What About Her?
Doesn't She Have A Choice?
She Has Refused All Suitors.
Therefore,
On Her 21st Birthday,
The Tournament
Must Decide For Her.
Bummer.
I Think I Agree.
Come. You Try.
<I>[Cat Screeching]</I>
You Are The Most Exquisite
Flower In This Garden, Princess.
There Is One Major Difference Between The
Garden Flowers And Myself, Lord Belasco.
Mmm?
A Rose Will Prick You,
But I Will Do Far Worse.
You Cut Me To The Quick.
All I Want Is What Is Best
For My King And His Kingdom.
Camelot Could Be Great.
We Could Make It Great Again.
"We"?
Yes, Of Course.
The Two Of Us Together,
In Wedded Bliss.
I Will Marry The Man
Who Wins The Tournament.
Enter It...
If You Have The Nerve.
Good Day, Sir.
So, Master Kane,
Where's Your Castle?
Oh, I Have No Land
Of My Own.
Does That Mean You Can't Enter The Tournament?
Alas, The Tournament Is Reserved
For Far Better Men Than I.
No Way.
You're The Best.
If Thou Art Trying
To Get On My Good Side,
Thou Has Succeeded
With Royal Colors.
<I>Ah. Here Is Thy Opponent.</I>
Wait!
I Can't Fight The Princess.
You Are Right
About That, Sir.
Come.
I Wonder.
Do The Knights
Of Reseda Swim?
You Have Much To Learn
Before Supper.
I Hear The Kitchen Is Serving A Poached
Goat's Head In A Brown Grub Sauce.
Oh!
Or Perhaps We Could
Catch Yon Goose.
[Grunting]
Oh. Whoa!
<I>[Laughing]</I>
Oh, Geez.
I Cannot Believe I Fell For The Oldest Trick In The Book.
<I>Then Again,
Since I'm Here,</I>
<I>Maybe It's The Newest
Trick In The Book.</I>
Hey. How's It Goin'?
Ah, Good Sir. My Shop
Is At Your Service.
Really? Well, Thanks. Uh,
I Hear You Can Make Anything.
Indeed, I Have
That Reputation.
What About This?
By The Circle Builders
Themselves.
Well, I Need Another Pair, Like, Yesterday.
Ah.
- Who's There?
- I Trust You Slept Well?
<I>Yeah. We All Did-- Me And The Forest
Of Crawling Things Living In My Bed.</I>
<I>All Right.</I>
Come. Breakfast Is Served In The Great Hall.
We Must Hurry Or We'll Be Late.
Just A Minute.
I Have Somethin' To Show Ya.
What Is It For?
[Princess Gasping,
Both Laughing]
Come On.
This Way.
Oh, Careful.
Come On.
So If It's "Bad,"
It's Good.
Right.
And If It's "Cool,"
It's Hot.
Oh, I Fear I Will Never
Understand Your Valley Speak.
Well, Belasco. What Dost Thou
Wish To Speak About?
<I>Decisions, Your Highness.
It's Time You Made One.</I>
What Didst Thou
Have In Mind?
I've Been Loyal To You
For Years, Your Highness,
And All I Ask For In Return
Is Sarah's Hand In Marriage.
Thou Knowest
The Laws Of Camelot.
The Tournament
Shall Decide For Her.
The Fate Of Camelot Cannot Rest
Upon The Folly Of A Tournament.
Can It, Your Highness?
I-- I Shall Speak To My Daughter On Thy Behalf.
- I Thank Thee, Your Highness.
- Watch Out!
[Belasco
Gasping]
Hey, The Round Table.
History Books Are Gonna Love Ya.
<I>Not Staying For Breakfast,
Lord Belasco?</I>
I Do Not Eat With Children!
Well, Sit, Sit
Before It Gets Cold.
So What's
For Breakfast?
Leftovers!
Mmm.
Guard It
With Your Life.
Go For It.
<I>For What Do We Owe This Unexpected Pleasure,
Lord Belasco?</I>
Out Of My Way, Teacher.
Well, If You've Had Enough
Of Fighting Wooden Men,
How Do You Fancy Taking On
A Real Man For A Change?
But, Sir--
This Has Nothing To Do
With You, Teacher.
Boy, You Guys Are Really Hung Up On This
Dominant Male Monkey Thing, Aren't You?
- I Take It Your Answer's No.
- Calvin!
[Groaning]
I Could Be Wrong,
But I Think I Just Qualified For A Black Belt.
You'd Better Use It
To Hang Yourself With,
Because When I Come For You,
It'll Be Worse.
Far, Far Worse.
[Groaning]
As A Reward,
Thou Hast Earned A Grand Supper.
On One Condition.
What Is That?
I Do The Cooking.
Oh.
Mmm, Smells Divine.
What Is It?
<I>A Surprise, Princess.</I>
- Oh, No! Those Are Poisonous Love Apples.
- Trust Me.
<I>And No Peeking.</I>
It Smells So Wonderful
I Can Hardly Wait.
Patience.
Okay. You Can Look Now.
'Tis Beautiful,
But What Is It?
It's A Meal Fit
For The Round Table:
Double Cheeseburger,
Lettuce And Tomato On A Whole Wheat Bun.
- What?
- Big Mac.
Mmm. It's Good!
<I>I Mean... "Bad."</I>
Thou Called
For Me, Father?
I Did? Oh, Yes, Yes, Yes.
Of Course I Did.
Oh, My Dear Daughter,
I Believe I Know What Is
Best For My Kingdom.
I Mean, A Game To Settle
The Fate Of Camelot?
I Fear The Tournament
Is An Outdated Notion.
Thou Art Dancing, Father.
Get To The Point.
I Have Decided That Thou Shalt Marry Lord Belasco.
If I Cannot
Marry For Love,
Then The Law Of The Land
Will Prevail.
I Shall Let
The Tournament Decide.
Thou Art As Stubborn
As Thy Mother.
Riding Isn't As Hard
As I Thought.
Avert Thy Eyes.
[Clicking Tongue]
Thou Was Not To See That.
Swear Your Silence To Me Now, Sir, Or Risk My Wrath.
Hey, It's None
Of My Business--
Swear It!
Okay, Okay!
I Swear It.
Can We Put This Off
'Til Next Tuesday?
It Is Time To Put
A Real Lance In Your Hand.
Look, This Is Too Soon.
I Still Get Car Sick On Merry-Go-Rounds.
Lean Into The Charge And The
Lance Will Do The Work For You.
<I>Why Don't You
Do The Work For Me?</I>
<I>Hast Thou No...</I>
Confidence In Thyself?
[Horse Whinnies]
Look! There's
A Two-Headed Dragon!
I See Only Trees.
Yeah. Maybe I Need
To Get My Eyes Checked.
<I>Calvin, Perhaps
You're Not Quite Ready.</I>
Of Course I Am.
Let Her Rip, Professor.
Hyah!
Whoa!
Whoa.
[Panting] No. No, No!
Go Left! Go Left!
- Hold It! Oh!
- [Horse Whinnying]
Oh. Aah!
Calvin?
[Groaning]
Look What You've Done.
How Could You?
- But, Princess, It Was You Who Asked--
- How Dare You Contradict Me?
This Is Your Fault!
Ohh.
I'm So Sorry.
Please Speak To Me.
You Deceived Me!
Thou Art Impertinent!
[Laughing] Ow!
Honest, Princess-- Wait!
[Laughing]
You Are A Clever Lad.
I Think She Likes Me.
Did Not Expect To See You Again So Soon, Sir.
The Blade Rollers Did Not Meet With Satisfaction?
No, No, They Were
A Killer.
But This Time,
I Need Somethin' Bigger.
Bigger?
It's Gotta Be Light As A Feather
But Hard As Belasco's Head.
I Know Of
No Such Metal.
You Will.
Melt This And That Together,
Stir...
And Then Stand Back.
How Does A Boy
Know So Much?
Metal Shop,
Eighth Grade.
See, You Start
With The Frame.
<I>What Is It,
Sister?</I>
Distress.
Burning Of The Heart.
No, 'Tis Not
Heartburn.
'Tis Heartache.
You Are In Love,
Little One.
Don't Be Silly!
Can't Hide Anything
From You, Can I?
I Know It All
Too Well Myself.
Does It Always
Hurt This Much?
Oh, Sometimes
It Hurts Much Worse.
Poor Father.
Every Day He Drifts
Further Away From Us.
What Is To Become
Of Our Family, Sarah?
I Know Not,
But I Will Always
Look After Thee.
Farewell, My Beauties.
What Are Thou
Eating, Lad?
Oh, Mad Dog Bubble Gum.
What?
Here.
No! You're Not
Supposed To Swallow.
You're Not?
[Sighs]
Here. Just Put It
In Your Mouth And Chew.
Chew.
Never Swallow.
Never Swallow.
Then What Is
Its Purpose?
There Is No Purpose.
No Purpose?
Strange.
Why Do They Call It
"Mad Dog Bubble Gum"?
I Have No Idea,
Your Highness.
[Muffled]
Mmm. Lord Belasco.
Uh-- Mmm.
Take A Seat.
Get Out.
Affairs Of The Court, Lad.
You Understand.
It's Okay.
I Have A Date.
- "Date"?
- I'll Explain Later.
Have You Spoken
To Your Daughter?
Yes, Of Course, Of Course.
And?
Well, I Cannot Force Her
To Marry Thee.
But If She Means That Much To You,
I Mean,
There's Always
The Tournament.
She Will Be Mine.
No One Will Have Her.
Ah, So You Are Planning
To Enter The Tournament.
Are You
A Complete Idiot?
Do You Think
I Want To Die?
There's Another Way.
[Door Closing]
I Came Only Because My Music Lessons Were Cancelled.
You're Still
Impertinent.
I'll Take That As A Compliment.
State Your Business
And I Shall Be On My Way.
I Have A Surprise For You.
What Is It?
It's A Mountain Bike.
What Is It For?
In Reseda,
We Have A Custom.
It's Called A Picnic.
Hop On.
Watch Your Step.
Here We Go.
Look At That.
Oh!
It's Not So Bad,
Is It?
'Tis So Fast.
You Know The Night You Took Me
To See Merlin's Book Of Spells?
Mm-Hmm.
Well, I Went Back,
And I Don't Know If I'm Goin' Crazy Or What,
But I Saw Merlin In The Well.
He Came To You?
Yeah, He Said That He
Brought Me Here To Save Camelot.
<I>Well, Actually,
He Didn't Bring Me Here.</I>
He-- He Meant
To Bring Someone Else.
He Chose Well.
What Are The Girls Like
In Reseda?
I Don't Know.
Course You Do.
Well, They're
Nothing Like You.
<I>[Horse Nickering]</I>
<I>[Townspeople Chattering]</I>
<I>[Man] Now What Do You Make Of That?</I>
<I>[People Chattering]</I>
<I>[Man] Hurry,
Before Belasco's Men Come!</I>
<I>[Cal] Boy,
They Sure Are Hungry.</I>
<I>[Woman] Better Save The Rest.
'Tis Lord Belasco I Fear.</I>
Where Did It All
Come From?
<I>[Man] Our Only Friend--</I>
<I>- [Whinnying]
- [Child] God Bless The Black Knight!</I>
The Black Knight
Is One Of The Good Guys?
It Cannot Be True.
Are You Okay?
Confused.
About The Black Knight?
And Other Things.
I Shall Never Forget
This Moment.
Hey, Where You Going?
[Sighs]
I'll Walk You
To Your Room.
Old Reseda Custom.
The More I Hear Of Reseda,
The More I Want To See It.
I Wish I Could
Take You There.
Good Night.
Princess,
I Haven't Had This Much Fun
In My Whole Life.
I Know You're Worried
About Your Father.
<I>[Cal Continues]
Me Too.</I>
<I>I Promise I'll Do Everything I Can To
Keep Belasco From Screwing Things Up.</I>
I Guess That's All.
Oh, Yeah.
You're A Great Kisser.
Wise Girl.
Come On!
One Sound And It
Would Have Been Your Last.
[Rumbling]
Get In There!
Come With Me!
[Katey
Screaming]
[Katey]
Help Me!
Hah!
<I>[Whip Cracking]</I>
What Sorcery Is This, Merlin, That I'm No
Longer Able To Brandish The Sword Excalibur?
<I>I Thought With Thee,
I Would Reign Forever.</I>
<I>I Was Wrong.</I>
Camelot Rots,
And I Play At Being King.
<I>I Want Her
Great Again.</I>
But I Fear I'm Too Weak
To Bring Her Back.
Oh, Guinevere.
My Guinevere.
<I>I'm Too Old.
I'm Too Tired.</I>
<I>Go Ahead.
Take It.</I>
<I>I Want You
To Have It.</I>
We Need To Talk.
<I>Oh.</I>
You're Not Trying To Dodge Your
Way Out Of Our Deal, Are You?
Oh, No, No,
Nothin' Like That.
- Hmm?
- I'm Just Not So Sure I Wanna Go Home Yet.
Ohh.
Of Course.
The Princess Katherine.
Yeah. She's Incredible.
True, But You Won't Have Much Of
A Honeymoon In Belasco's Dungeon.
- Good Point.
- I Suggest You Take Excalibur.
<I>- What About Arthur?
- You Must Lead The Way.</I>
Now.
Wait!
- Was There Something Else?
- Aren't You Gonna Wish Me Luck?
Very Well.
Good Luck.
Are You Going To Need It.
<I>Ah! Princess.
So Good Of You To Come On Such Short Notice.</I>
Your Servant Said I Would Be Supremely
Interested In What You Have To Say.
Well, He Did Not
Exaggerate.
Then Say It
And I Shall Be On My Way.
How Dare You!
When My Father Hears How You're Treating Me--
Look, I Didn't Bring You Here To Listen
To Your Incessant Royal Prattle!
Now Shut Your Mouth And Your
Sister Will Remain Unharmed.
What Have You Done
With My Sister?
She's Safe.
For Now.
But I'm Getting Tired Of Waiting
For You To Accept My Offer.
You Are Mad.
You Cannot Force Me
To Marry You.
Well, If You Do Not Consent,
Then Princess Katherine Will Die.
This Pact Is Between You And Me.
You Utter One Word Of This To Anyone...
And You'll Never See
Your Sister Again.
I Await Your Answer.
You Have Until
The Tournament.
Sweet Dreams.
Night-Night.
Huh?
- What Do You Want?
- You're Under Arrest...
For The Murder
Of Princess Katherine.
Seize Him.
[Yells]
[Grunts]
Find Him
And Then Kill Him.
Calvin, I Must
Speak To You Of Katey.
I Didn't Do It. All We Did Was Go On A Picnic.
I Swear. I Didn't Kill Her.
She's Been Kidnapped Under Belasco's Orders.
I Need Your Help.
My Help?
You Must Bring Her Back.
<I>Ahem. All Right,
This Way.</I>
They're Looking For Me.
Belasco Tried To Arrest Me.
Then You Only Have One Chance.
Just One, Huh?
My Father--
Give Him This.
He Will Know You Speak The Truth.
<I>- Guards. He Went This Way.
- Come With Me.</I>
Calvin.
Calvin, Come.
Huh?
[Panting]
[Snores]
<I>[Crashing]</I>
<I>By Merlin's Prophecies,
Dost Thou Come At Me In My Sleep?</I>
<I>[Grunts] Thou Shalt Not Take Me That Easily.</I>
Come Into The Light,
You Cowards!
Calvin, Which Way
Did They Flee?
How Many Were There?
Five? Ten?
Oh, The Royal Blood Is Pumping Now.
Leave Us Ride After The Interlopers.
Sire, Stop! There Are No
Interlopers Or Outer-Lopers.
Don't Be Ridiculous, Boy.
Get Me My Royal Wardrobe.
The Hunt Is On.
Katey Has Been Kidnapped.
Kidnapped?
My Baby Is Sleeping
With The Goats?
She's Been
Taken Prisoner.
That's Impossible.
Belasco's Orders.
But I Would Trust Belasco
With My Life.
Bad Idea, Sire.
You've Been Faked Out, Played For A Sucker.
Your Chain Has Been Royally Pulled.
All Right, Boy,
I Get The Point.
Belasco Plans On Stealing
Camelot Just Like He Stole Katey.
I Cannot Believe It.
So, It's All True.
<I>[Knocking]</I>
Yes? Who Is It?
<I>Lord Belasco, Your Highness.</I>
Oh, Lord Belasco.
Why Art Thou Disturbing My Sleep?
I'm Sorry,
Your Highness.
I Have Some Terrible News.
Princess Katherine Is Dead.
Dead? Katey?
My Poor,
Poor Katey Dead!
Who Has Done This?
Calvin Of Reseda,
Your Highness.
Calvin Of Reseda!
<I>After I Fed Him And Clothed Him,
This Is The Thanks I Get!</I>
Why Art Thou Wasting My Time?
Find The Boy. Bring Me His Head On A Pike.
Your Wish Is
My Command, Sire.
He'll Be Dead By Daybreak,
Your Highness.
Calvin? Calvin?
Ah. My Artifice Was
Well Nigh Rewarded, Lad.
He Bought It?
He Bought It.
You Know Where They
Might've Taken Her?
I Do Indeed, Lad.
[Driver] Hyah!
Come On! [Cracks Whip]
What Are You Going
To Do With Me?
Nothing...
If Your Sister Gives Herself
To Lord Belasco In Betrothal.
In You Go.
And If She Doesn't?
Hmm.
<I>[Cal] Anyway,
We're Gonna Have To Go In Disguise.</I>
Disguise?
Yeah, I Figure
If We Look Like...
Miserable, Starving,
Pathetic Peasants, No One Will Notice.
Peasants? Hmph!
Don't Be Ridiculous, Boy.
The Royal Pendragon Strikes Fear
Into The Hearts Of My Enemies.
Not Anymore It Doesn't.
What Do You Know, Boy?
They Hate You.
Hate Me?
Belasco's Been Stealing
From Your People For Years.
There's Nothing But Sickness
And Starvation In Camelot, And...
They Think You Don't
Care About Them.
They Hate Me.
You Do Care,
Don't You?
Of Course I Do, Lad.
Come. I Know
A Way Out.
[Arthur, Cal

[Hiccups, Burps]
Yuck!
More Boar Snouts?
<I>[Cal] Come On.
This Is Where We Get Off. Jump.</I>
Oh! [Chuckling] I Rather Like This:
Out Among My Own People.
Watch Whom You Bathe,
O Washerwoman.
Washerwoman, Eh? And Who Do You Think You Are?
The Bloody King Of England?
<I>As A Matter Of Fact,
I Am Your King.</I>
<I>And I'm
Cleo-Bleedin'-Patra.</I>
Come On. Let's Go.
If Thou Were A Man,
I Would Call Thee Out!
If You Were A Man,
I'd Throw More Than A Bath Over Ya.
Let's Go.
Stop!
Look, Your Majesty,
I Don't Wanna Insult You, But Are You Nuts?
This Isn't The Castle Where Everyone Kisses Your Butt.
This Is The Real, In-Your-Face,
Car-Jacking, Drive-By-Shooting,
Kill-You-For-Your-Reeboks Street Life.
What Language
Art Thou Speaking, Boy?
Let Me Give It To You Straight.
They Find Out You're The King, You're Dead Meat.
The Murderer!
Come On, Men!
[Shouting, Yelling]
[Groaning]
[Groaning]
[Groaning]
Merlin,
Where Art Thou Now?
Sire!
Sire, Run!
<I>[Soldiers Groaning]</I>
We Are Lost.
The Royal Stables Is Under Heavy Guard.
We Shall Never
Reach The Princess In Time.
Yeah, We Will.
Huh?
This Is Sorcery!
We Are Going To Die!
Your Highness,
Are You Okay?
If "Okay" Means A Sore Bum,
Then Yes. [Groans]
- Great.
- The Black Knight!
After Him!
Chill Out.
He's On Our Side.
On Our Side?
I Don't Understand.
[Sighs]
Let's Boogie.
Boogie?
Boogie?
I'm So Sorry About
The Princess Katey.
I Missed You
Desperately.
I Came Not For Comfort.
I Came To Say Good-Bye.
Good-Bye?
Oh, Dear Sweet Kane,
I Have Lost Everyone I Have Ever Loved,
And Now I Have Lost You.
No! You Have
Not Lost Me.
No Matter What We Think, No Matter How We Feel,
Our Lives Are Not Our Own.
Well, Then, We Will
Make Them Our Own.
It Is Too Late.
I Must Marry Lord Belasco.
Come On, Men!
We've Got Him!
Go On.
Right.
You Know,
When I Was A Boy,
Much The Same As You,
I Could Not Face The Things I Feared.
It Was By Sheer Accident I Pulled
The Sword Excalibur From The Stone.
Oh, It's True Over The Years I
Grew Into A Strong King, But...
Now, Alas,
I Fear I've Become That Cowering Boy Again.
I've Lost All Faith
In Myself.
And If I Cannot Believe
In Myself, Who Will?
You Know, Sire,
Where I Come From, There Are No Swords In
Stones That Turn Dweebs Like Me Into Heroes.
I Used To Think
I Needed One.
But You Know What?
I Don't.
You're A Good Man,
Calvin Fuller.
This Is Impossible.
There's No Way Into This Place.
How Did You Say It?
"Chill Out."
[Sighs]
[Horses Neigh]
Cool.
A Secret Passage.
Ahh. Merlin Showed It
To Me Long Ago...
When I Played Here
As A Boy.
[Squeaking]
- [Shrieks]
- Shh.
<I>Help!</I>
He's Got Her
In The Dungeon.
<I>[Shrieking]</I>
Hey, You.
Hey, Where Do You Think You're Going?
Bow To The King,
You Dog!
- Father!
- Katey!
Oh, I Knew You'd Come!
<I>[Cal]
Hi.</I>
You Wouldn't Happen
To Have A Key, Would Ya?
I Have Something
Better, Lad.
A Father's Love
For A Daughter.
And A King's Shoulder!
Ohh!
Ah! I'm Sorry, Lad.
I'm No Match For Merlin's Door.
Maybe Not.
But This Is.
- What Sorcery Is This?
- A Swiss Army Knife.
<I>"A Swiss Army Knife."
The Very Name Conjures Up Greatness.</I>
Yeah, It's Right Up There With Harley Davidson.
Cool.
Come, Daughter.
Come. Quick. Come.
Guards!
[Groaning]
Nice One.
Shh.
Your Majesty.
- Welcome.
- We're In Big Trouble.
<I>- What I'd Give For Excalibur Now.
- You've Got It.</I>

Katey!
After Him, Boy!
[Katey Screams]
Let Me Go!
Richard. Stay Where You Are.
Let My Daughter Go.
Stop There!
Or She Flies Like A Bird.
<I>- No, Take Me!
- Stay Put!</I>
Or Her Blood Will Be
On Your Hands, Boy.
Come. We'll
Charge Together.
I Have A Better Idea.
<I>Oh, I'm Afraid Rock And Roll
Will Not Work This Time.</I>
You're Wrong.
It Is The Great Equalizer.
[Screaming]
Oh, Calvin.
So, What About Me?
Father.
[Both Sighing]
[Cal]
Why Are We Stopping Here?
Come.
This Is As Fine
A Place As Any.
For What, Sire?
Kneel, Lad.
- Kneel?
- Just Do It.
Calvin Fuller
Of Reseda,
Dost Thou Swear Allegiance
To Thy King And Thy Kingdom?
Dost Thou Swear To Uphold The Laws Of Camelot?
And To Always Follow The Paths
Of Righteousness And Goodness?
I'll Try, Your Highness.
I Will.
Then Let All
Who Witness This Know--
It Doth Not Take A Sword
In Stone To Make A Hero.
By The Sword Excalibur,
I Dub Thee...
Knight Of The Round Table.
Arise... Sir Calvin
Of Reseda.
We Have Some
Unfinished Business.
Thank You For Coming.
Your Wish
Is My Command, Princess.
Made Your Decision Yet?
Yes.
And?
I Will Consent
To Marry You.
I Always Knew You Were
The Smart One In The Family.
Oh, Thank God.
Oh, Father!
I See You Have Your Old Friend With You.
I Do Indeed,
Dear Daughter.
I, Too, Am Delivered.
You're Looking, Uh,
Extremely Well, Your Highness.
If You'll Excuse Me, I'll Go And Get Ready For
The Tournament. Welcome Back, Darling.
You're Gonna Let Him Walk After All He's Done?
Well, I'm Not.
Wait, Lad.
Now Remember:
The People Believe Me To Be A Coward,
And The Guards Are Still Loyal To Belasco.
Bide Thy Time, Young Knight.
When The Hour Is Nigh, We'll Nail Him.
<I>Father.</I>
My People--
<I>My People,</I>
You Belong To The Land,
And So Do I.
I Was But A Stable Boy When I Pulled Excalibur
From The Stone And You Made Me Your King.
For Years, Together,
We Made Camelot Great.
And Then I Turned
My Back On You.
<I>I Betrayed Your Trust.</I>
But, My People,
I Shall Fail You
No Longer!
From This Day Henceforth,
The Tournament Shall Be
Open To All Free Men.
<I>[Crowd Cheering]</I>
And Let It Be Known:
The Great Sword Excalibur,
Camelot,
My Daughter's Hand,
<I>All Shall Belong
To My Successor,</I>
<I>The Last Man Unhorsed
In Honorable Combat.</I>
Let The Tournament Begin.
<I>[Crowd Cheering]</I>
That's Your Cue,
Professor.
I Can't Believe My Ears.
Go, Son.
Prepare Thyself.
Thou Deserveth A Place
In My Court.
Let's Go, Loverboy.
You Still Gotta Win This Turkey.
Here.
I've Been Saving This For A Special Occasion.
<I>It's Called
A Candy Bar.</I>
Is It Food?
Compared To What You're Used To,
It's Gourmet Dining.
You Are Truly
A Great Knight.
<I>[Crowd Applauding,
Cheering]</I>
[Neighs]
You Have Defeated
All Opponents.
Only One Of You Will Leave
This Field Of Honor...
<I>And One Day Rule
In My Stead.</I>
Kick His Butt.
[Whimpers]
No!
I Fear That Kane
Is Defeated.
Hey, You Know The Rules.
He's Still On His Horse.
He's Right, Father. As Long As He's On His Steed,
He's Still In The Game.
Stall Him.
I'll Be Right Back.
It Is Done.
I Claim My Victory.
As You've Not Unhorsed Master Kane,
He Is Not Yet Defeated.
- But, Sire--
- Rules Are Rules.
Very Well Then.
I Shall Await The Allotted Time.
Then You Can Proclaim My Legacy.
Ah, I Can Hardly Wait.
Hurry.
Sir Kane, How Many Fingers
Am I Holding Up?
Just A Little Off The Top.
Keep The Sideburns.
He Speaks In Tongues.
Hey! Where Are
You Going?
To Announce Sir Kane's Defeat.
He's Not Defeated.
He's--
He's Meditating.
Oh, Hurry, Calvin.
The Time Has Passed, Your Highness.
Please, Declare My Victory.
Wrong Again... Dweeb.
<I>[Crowd Cheering]</I>
<I>[Crowd]
Ohh!</I>
'Tis Black Magic.
You're History, Belasco.
Your Blood Is Mine!
Hey, Chill Out, Dude!
[Yells]
Prepare To Meet
Thy Ancestors.
<I>[Grunting]
He's Got My Cloth!</I>
[Crowd Laughing,
Cheering]
Thou Hast Won The Tournament,
Sir Knight.
Sarah's Hand Is Thine.
Sarah?
But I Hardly Know Her.
Oh, It Is Not A Question Of Familiarity.
It Is A Question Of Victory. Isn't It?
No, Father.
It Is Not.
Hmm.
Listen, I'm Not Your Knight In Shining Armor.
He Is.
It Seems I Owe Thee More Than One Debt Of Gratitude,
Sir Knight.
Reveal Thyself So That
We May All Know Thee.
[People Murmuring]
Who Is It?
<I>[Crowd]
Ohh!</I>
Hello, Father.
<I>[Woman]
The Princess!</I>
Daughter.
Daughter,
Thou Hast Won
The Right To Choose.
<I>[Woman] God Bless Princess Sarah And Master Kane!</I>
<I>[Crowd Cheers]</I>
[Grunting]
<I>As For Thee, Lord Belasco,
Thou Art Banished From My Kingdom Forever.</I>
<I>If I Were Thee,
I Would Not Stop Until Thou Reachest--</I>
- Cucamonga.
- Cucamonga.
Cucamonga?
You Are
A Great Knight.
I Had
A Great Teacher.
<I>Sir Calvin.</I>
My Kingdom Is Thine.
What Dost Thou Want?
A Castle? A Dukedom?
I Just Wanna Go Home.
Godspeed, Sir Calvin.
You've Given Me So Much.
Is There Anything I Can Give You?
No.
[Chuckles]
I Wouldn't Mind
That Swiss Army Knife.
Is There Nothing I Can Say Or Do To Make You Stay?
I Have To Go Back.
You Won't Forget Me?
How Could I?
I'm Ready, Merlin.
You Have Done Well,
Brave Knight.
<I>Thank You,
Sir Calvin.</I>
And Now It's Time For Me To
Keep My End Of The Bargain.
Behold:
Your Way Home.
Are You Sure About This?
<I>[Merlin]
Trust Me.</I>
I'm Back.
There Wasn't
Any Earthquake.
You're Up, Fuller.
- Ventilate 'Em, Calvin.
- He Brought Me Back Before I Struck Out.
Try Swingin' This Time,
Fuller.
Thanks, Hal.
I Love Your Tan.
<I>[Cheering]
Come On! Whoo!</I>
<I>It's Only A Game, Son.
Just Give It Your Best Shot.</I>
<I>[Mother] Good Luck, Honey.
We're All Rootin' For Ya.</I>
I Get Your Room
If You Get Killed.
- You Got It.
- Yes! Yes!
Relax. Just Remember
What I Told You.
Three Things,
Right, Coach?
Go For It, Kid.
<I>[Crowd]
Yea!</I>
[Crowd Cheering] Come On!
Come On! You Can Do It!
<I>[Arthur]
Calvin.</I>
<I>Remember: It Does Not Take A
Sword In Stone To Make A Hero.</I>
You're Dead Meat,
Fuller.
Not This Time, Baker.
[Shrieks]
Run!
Nice Going, Fuller.
Katey?
[Chuckling]
You Were Great.
<I>I Knew You
Could Do It!</I>
Taught The Kid
Everything He Knows.
From the dawn of time we came, moving silently among you... down through the centuries... immortals.
I'm Connor MacLeod of the clan MacLeod, the Highlander.
After the death of my friend Ramirez,
And my beloved wife Heather,
I left my home in the highlands of Scotland... and began to wander the world searching for answers.
Finally, I came to Japan... to the mountains of Niri and the cave of the sorcerer Nakano.
Great danger lies ahead, Highlander.
From a faraway land comes another, the most feared and evil among us.
He keeps growing stronger everyday, feeding on the power of other immortals.
Soon, there will be none left who can stop him.
If he wins, the world will suffer eternal damnation.
Who is he?
His name is Kane.
The mountain of Niri, where is it?
What for?
Listen! Where is the mountain of Niri?
Do you seek the power of the sorcerer Nakano?
Maybe the old man still can't hear me.
- Burn it down!
- Yeah!
- Hyah!
- No! Oh!
Come on!
Hey!
How do I kill him?
With a heart, soul and steel.
I've heard that before.
I know.
Ramirez.
Like him,
I have lived many lifetimes.
And like him, my gift to you is my knowledge.
The knowledge does not come easy, Highlander.
Nothing is what it seems,
Highlander.
First, you must be aware and respect the power of illusion.
You have already lost.
Fight with your spirit... and the sword will follow.
Well done, Highlander.
The sword wields the spirit of its master.
It can be the gate to either heaven or hell.
Just strike at my head and you will take all my knowledge.
I will not.
Not even for the power of illusion?
Not even.
- Where to now, Kane?
- There.
Oh, yes.
This is the place.
- Shh. You have to go now.
- What?
Shh. Trust me.
You must leave.
Nakano.
You have a long journey ahead of you.
Why do I have to go?
This is not your time,
Highlander.
Remember... they're both mine.
Now, go!
I won't forget you.
Ah, Nakano.
So good to see you again.
The pleasure is always mine!
Actually, the pleasure's all mine!
Where is the Highlander?
Huh?
You age badly, you old goat.
Aah.
I think this is the Highlander.
There can be only one!
Always in the way, old man, huh?
More than you know.
When I tell you to go, just go!
Go after the Highlander!
Now!
So.
Your magic has improved, wizard.
Why don't you give it to me?
I didn't give it you
200 years ago.
- I'm not about to now!
- Yes.
But if I cut off your head,
I get your magic anyway.
So... we could do this the easy way... or we could do this... the hard way.
My head doesn't come off that easy.
No? But it does come off, nonetheless.
You betrayed yourself, old man.
There can be... only one.
Yes, only one!
But it will not be you!
Hi, Alex. Good to see you.
Hi, Takamura. How are you?
Fine, thank you.
The archaeological commission is waiting.
The owner of the corporation is threatening... to shut us down so he can continue his foundations.
They can't stop the excavation now.
Japanese government has enormous respect for such a famous archaeologist as yourself, but this is a delicate situation.
Well, from what you sent me to authenticate, definitely 16th century.
But check the grid points.
Do you realize this spot is less than a mile from the center of Niri?
What are you suggesting?
The cave of the sorcerer Nakano?
Alex-san, Nakano is a legend.
Oh, which reminds me.
- So's Babe Ruth... based on fact.
- Domo Arigato.
Oh, Alex.
The commission.
Highlander's out there somewhere.
And he owes me 400 years.
Find him!
Nothing more!
Just find him.
Where are we?
What's happening?
Nothing really left for you to worry about, my friend.
- There can be only one!
- Kane!
Ahhh.
Dad, is it okay?
Yeah.
I didn't think there could be lightning without clouds.
Let's go.
How can this be happening?
They were all dead and the prize was mine.
So who is out there?
And where is he?
If anything happens to me,
I want you to look after John.
What are you talking about?
I have to leave, Jack.
Everything is taken care of.
Does the boy know you're not his real father?
Oh, yeah. He knew he was adopted before he could spell it.
I hope whatever's taking you is worth what you're leaving.
I hope so too.
But I don't have a choice.
I know he's alive... and I have to find him.
Going back to New York to the place of the gathering... is not what I had in mind.
Once again, my life was about to change.
What are they doing?
I thought we got clearance last night.
You won't believe this, Alex-san.
Someone broke into the dig.
Oh, shit.
So what did they take?
- We don't know.
- What do you mean, you don't know?
I couldn't pass the police line.
They found two bodies.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
So this must be the inner chamber.
But how did they know it was here?
Look at this!
What, 1500s?
Remarkable copy.
- Alex.
- I just want a sample.
- Why?
- I don't think it's a copy.
John.
John.
Hey. I'm not gonna be away long.
Well, you better call me.
Hey.
You better call me.
You take care of the place.
You're in charge now.
Come here.
I love you, John.
Get out of the road!
Hey, pendejo. What are ya doin' here?
Stop the car!
Hey, Antonio.
Hey, vamos, carnales.
Yeah, that's a cold thing, my man.
Pretty late for a walk, hey, motherfucker?
Little boy lost his way.
Hey, fuckhead,
I'm talkin' to you.
Nice blade.
Gang beating!
Malloy! Here!
- Clear the way! Come on, move!
- Severe trauma.
- Internal bleeding, two gunshot wounds, 38 caliber.
- Vital signs?
- Stable.
- Lucky guy.
- Notify the police?
- Of course.
What the fuck are you talking about?
These aren't bullet wounds.
- Impossible.
- Stop wasting my time!
- This guy was shot!
- You can deal with it.
- Doctor! Malloy!
- Restrain him!
Grab hold of him!
Get me a sedative!
Let me go!
You don't understand!
Let me go!
Take him up to ward seven right away.
- Ward seven?
- You got a problem with that?
This guy's a lunatic.
Well... it's definitely not a fake.
It doesn't make any sense.
Alex-san, how do you explain this?
- Where'd you find it?
- In the chamber.
It's old, maybe 300, 400 years.
But look at the pattern.
- The weave. Certainly not Japanese.
- Looks like some sort of tartan.
Scotland?
That's a long way from Japan.
Especially 400 years ago.
Waterloo, my greatest battle. If only
I'd used my left flank before dawn.
Wellington, you swine!
You are better prepared than me.
Me, the great emperor Napoleon.
Keep it down.
Who are you?
Martin.
Remember?
- Your favorite soldier.
- Martin?
- Yes.
- Is it you?
- Yeah.
- My God, what are you doing here?
I had to warn you.
You're in great danger.
I know.
It's not safe here.
Please help me.
Oh, great one.
My mission is not over yet.
What mission?
Wellington. Remember?
I have to kill him.
Nephew, make him suffer.
- Hey, how do I get out of here?
- Leave it to me.
Soldiers, I'm proud of you!
Finally the time has come and the time is now!
Hip, hip, hooray!
Shut up!
Yeah, man, let's dump this stuff and go.
Highlander!
I am your shadow!
Where is Kane?
Don't worry about Kane.
Worry about me.
You've already lost.
There can be only one.
So what do you got, Vorisek?
We got a body here and we got a head over there.
Now, I suspect foul play.
Maybe you should've taken over for Carson, you're so funny.
Lieutenant, we got a guy in a halloween costume gets his head sliced off.
- It's not your usual humdrum assassination.
- Where's the sword?
- How'd you know about that? I was saving that as a surprise.
- I remember things.
You, you forget, but I remember.
Hey, Lieutenant, you know, we checked for prints already.
Wasted your time.
You won't find nothin'.
Somebody broke out of the psycho ward, came down and did this hell of a mess.
Russell Nash.
- You see, he's a genius.
- Yeah? So you know the victim?
I know the killer.
Mr. Nash.
Lieutenant John Stenn,
N.Y.P.D.
- What do you want?
- Eight years ago, you got away with it.
But I'm not Detective Bedsoe.
I'm gonna nail you. That's a promise.
Have a good night,
Lieutenant.
Whoop.
Sorry, Charlie.
- Twenty bucks in my hand.
- Twenty in mine.
- All right.
- Yo, yo, the brother. The brother.
My brother, come on in, come on in.
Tell you what, you find the red card,
I'll give you $20 now.
Easy as that.
You do my magic.
Boom. You're on.
- I never seen that shit before.
- Hey, yo, how'd he do that?
Hey, yo!
Yo, gimme back my money.
My glasses!
Fuck it, man.
You keep the money, all right?
Welcome back, MacLeod.
Get back in the car immediately, please! My son...
I have with me American archaeologist,
Dr. Alex Johnson, who's from the New York Museum of Ancient History.
Dr. Johnson, what can you tell us about the discovery, and why is it so exciting?
Well, the artifacts are clearly exceptional, but only after a much more detailed analysis...
- Sarah.
- Will we be able to speculate as to the identities...
Do I know you?
No.
No. Hmm?
I thought not.
So, what are you doing here?
Well, I may be mistaken, but I had the feeling... that this was the house of Mr. DeFernet.
Well, you're obviously not mistaken.
Ah, Connor MacLeod.
I see you've met my rather spirited niece, Sarah.
- She's come here from England.
- It seems I'm in need of taming.
Pleasant challenge...
I would imagine.
I invited him for the weekend to join us at the card table.
- So you're a gambler, Mr. MacLeod?
- On occasion.
So am I.
On occasion.
Any chance of a preview?
Not at this point, but some of the more unusual objects... will be lent to our existing exhibition...
However, is it not possible to be stepping on the site... of the legendary lost cave of the great Japanese sorcerer Nakano?
As I've said before, any speculation at this point would be a little premature.
Well, is it not true that supported by your own controversial studies, that legends can be used to identify archaeological sites?
It is true that we have seen parallels between missing sites before.
What about the inscriptions?
Do they offer clues or is this some cave-robbing graffiti?
It's probably just some ancient taggers.
Taggers. Well, Ms. Johnson, so no idea what it means?
I know what it means.
As for the alphabet... uh, early Russian.
"There can be only one. "
Only one what?
Alex-san, another fax from Tommy.
"A little something to read on the flight home.
I thought this might interest you. "
Well, that's it for me.
I'm off to New York tonight.
Better document that last crate.
The man wants vinyl when he can have the real thing?
I don't think so.
Come on.
Why don't you come here a little bit and make yourself comfortable?
You nice, big boy.
Come on, you little devil.
Silent type, huh?
It fine by me, baby.
But I'm telling you... no glove... no love.
What you waiting for, honey?
Come on, baby.
So after three days, this better be good.
Well, it wasn't easy, but I finally determined the cause of death.
All right, now that we've had our little joke, what else you got?
Nothin'.
Besides havin' his head cut off, he's in perfect health.
No broken bones, no cavities, no organ deterioration.
Like a newborn baby.
Find out who he is?
He's nobody.
No prints, no dental, no nothin'.
It's like he never existed.
So what do you really think, Howard?
Mmm. I think you better not smoke in here, Lieutenant.
What's this guy doin' in New York City?
What's he doin' on the planet?
Thanks, Howard!
MacLeods. But I checked it. Same pattern, didn't match up.
Apparently, this alteration in the color... denotes a branch of the clan that broke away in, I think, 1536.
Some incident occurred that year... involving a Connor MacLeod who was driven from his home, accused of wielding powers thought to have been unnatural.
So in defiance, the father altered this insignia to honor the son's lineage, but there's been no record of this branch ever since.
Except for a piece of cloth.
Which could now place one of them in a Japanese cave a few years later.
Yeah, but what would a Scot be doing there?
What if he was one of these
Gaelic mystics?
Nakano's initiates were said to have been great sorcerers, right?
- Yeah.
- None of the legends refer to where they came from.
Interesting theory, but,
Alex, no records, no proof.
Once a year, the MacLeods meet at Dunvegan Castle, Isle of Skye.
According to the registrar, this entry was made in 1986, some antique dealer claiming to be a direct descendant... of this particular branch.
So where's this guy from?
New York.
They faxed me his address.
What? You're gonna harass some poor guy about his ancestors?
- He's gonna think you're crazy.
- Perhaps.
Then again, at this point, it may be my only link to Nakano.
Well... I'm off.
Bye, Tommy.
I'll tell security you're working late.
Thanks.
- What do you call this place?
- Excuse me?
This place, here.
What do you call it?
Uh... A museum, but we're closed.
Museum.
Ah, no, please.
I'm your biggest fan.
You see, I saw you on television.
I'm a big historian myself really.
Ah, this looks familiar.
Oh, isn't it amazing how the present just can't seem to escape the past?
C- Can I help you with something?
No, no, no. I'm just a...
Just doing a little research.
Ooh, look at this cave.
Little small, eh?
And what does your museum call it?
- A model.
- A model.
And you?
Um, um, a vision of a past reality, I suppose.
Oh, reality.
No, not reality.
Reality is so boring.
I much prefer... illusion or fantasy, a little hocus pocus and maybe a little...
Maybe a little bit of... hanky-panky, huh?
Connor MacLeod.
Don't worry, my prissy,
I'll find him.
I'm gonna find him.
Burn it down.
I'm outside the Japanese
Spiritual Center in Queens.
Hyah!
Ya!
- Good to have you back, Nash.
- Good to see you, Charlie.
Hyah!
Come on! Come on!
Come on!
Whooo-oh!
Come on. Come on.
Hyah!
I wish we could go on like this for a thousand years.
What do you wish?
MacLeod?
That he had better timing.
What do you want, Pierre?
I have bad news.
They need you in Paris.
Why now?
The revolution has started.
You must leave the girl.
Come now, my friend.
If not for you, then do it for her.
You're not coming back, are you?
You have to get back to England.
- It won't be safe here.
- No one is safe now.
Connor.
Take this.
Russell Nash?
- Excuse me?
- Sorry. Are you Russell Nash?
- What if I am?
- I'm looking for the previous owner of your shop, a Connor MacLeod.
You wouldn't happen to know where I could find him, would you?
Did you follow me?
Yes.
I haven't seen him in eight years.
Do... Do you know if he's still in the area?
I wish I could help you,
Miss Johnson.
How do you know my name?
Well, you're, uh... discovery in Japan has made you famous.
You're obviously... interested in Japan yourself, Mr. Nash.
Strange food.
Good cars.
Tough deals.
Listen, it's getting late.
Good night, Miss Johnson.
Look, Mr. Nash,
I don't mean to bother you, but you're my only link to this Connor MacLeod.
Try the phone book.
There's plenty of MacLeods in New York.
Well, thanks, but I'm only looking for one.
So am I.
Four hundred years... is a long time to hate.
Ohh.
And you never wrote.
But hate feeds you.
It focuses the mind.
Keeps you warm.
Gives you hope.
Eh, MacLeod?
Don't worry about the girl.
She's not really my type.
A little too... pale.
Then again, this being the 90s,
I, I could make an exception, huh?
After all, I've got so much catching up to do.
This is a Buddhist shrine, Kane, and we can't fight on holy ground.
Oh, well... I guess
I'll be the judge of that.
Hyah!
Oooh.
Nothing!
There can be only...
One!
After 400 years, patience is a virtue.
Jesus Christ!
I'm goin' in!
Listen!
Whatever you saw, you saw nothing.
You don't know what you're getting yourself into.
Stay away.
Freeze! Police!
One more thing I think you should know about:
There was a woman.
Worked with us once in a while. Brenda.
Brenda Wyatt.
- What about her?
- Well, she was fascinated by... the murders, the swords... the whole thing.
Lieutenant, it's what,
5:00 in the morning?
They scraped her off a highway in Scotland seven years ago.
She was killed instantly, but he walked away... without a scratch.
Sad for him.
So, are you sure you didn't see anything?
- Miss Johnson!
- Sorry. No.
Russell Nash is a dangerous man.
Now I suggest you stay away from him.
That's exactly what he said.
Please, my friend.
For the revolution.
MacLeod!
Visitor!
Calm down, MacLeod.
If you die, we lose a great warrior against evil.
I'm here to take your place.
Go home and sleep it off.
Come on.
I'm tired of this eternal life.
Death would release me from my pain.
Come on, Pierre.
Go home.
I'm not going anywhere.
It's time, Mr. MacLeod.
When he wakes up, throw him out.
God be with you.
For treason against the King of France.
Connor MacLeod.
Connor! Connor!
Connor!
Oh, Sarah.
Yes?
Well, it was a very interesting evening last night, but I didn't exactly have time to check the phone book... Mr. MacLeod.
You wanna come in?
Come in.
I'll fix you a drink.
Make yourself comfortable.
Thanks.
You've, uh, got quite a collection.
- Hello?
- Mr. MacLeod?
This is Janet at Super Travel.
I'm calling to confirm your reservation on the Newark-Glasgow flight.
Your ticket is prepaid and waiting at the counter.
- Thanks.
- Bye.
Bye.
Lot of Connors in the family.
Her name was Sarah.
Come on, dear.
Ah, Papa.
Look, I don't know what was going on last night, but I think it's got something to do with what I'm working on.
We found a piece of tartan in the cave that was traced to... an undocumented branch of the MacLeods, of which... you are apparently the only member on record.
That cave was sealed
400 years ago.
Have you ever heard of the legend of the sorcerer Nakano?
Don't you ever think about anything else but business?
Do you have something better to offer?
It seems
I'm in need of taming.
Pleasant challenge...
I would imagine.
Well, I'm sure you'll let me know if something comes to mind, huh?
Hm. What's this?
Looks familiar.
Death to the MacLeods!
My bonny Heather, my first wife, my first love.
I came back here because this is where it all started.
And I need some strength.
God.
Ahh. The last 400 years... have been good to you, MacLeod.
Oh.
Oops-a-daisy.
Hi. Leave a message;
I'll call you back.
Uh, hi, it's me, John.
I miss you.
When are you coming home?
Uh, y-you said you were gonna call me, remember?
Well, in case you forgot, it's Marrakesh 1442.
Love you, Daddy. Bye.
Daddy.
Daddy.
Hey, MacLeod.
I thought you'd find me.
Why did you come?
Nakano.
You seem like you belong here.
Maybe I used to.
But that was a long time ago.
You spend a lot of time alone.
I'm used to it.
Nobody is.
You don't let people in, do you?
I can't.
- It hurts. Love and...
- And see them die?
Like the woman in the painting.
Yes.
I loved her very much.
I know who you are.
You're Connor MacLeod.
Born into the clan MacLeod, in Glen Finnan, on the shores of Loch Shiel.
You were driven from your home in 1536.
- And I cannot die.
- And have wandered the world ever since.
- Mr. MacLeod?
- Yeah?
There's a Jack Donovan on the phone returning your call.
I'll be right back.
- Jack.
- What are you doing in Scotland?
- What do you mean?
- John's on the flight from Marrakesh.
He gets into Newark tomorrow afternoon as planned.
- What are you saying, Jack?
- Is something wrong with your memory?
I've just dropped him at the airport.
Is there a problem?
No problem, Jack.
I'll pick him up.
Bye, Jack. Thanks.
Passport, please.
You're traveling alone?
Um, yeah, but my dad's picking me up.
Welcome to the United States,
Mr. MacLeod.
Thanks.
- Yeah.
- What?
- They got Nash.
- Where?
All right, we'll be right there.
Northwest Airlines. Flight 489.
Just landed in Newark.
Come on, move. Let's go!
It's over there.
The green bag. Grab it.
I know he's here somewhere.
I can feel him.
Excuse me.
- Excuse me.
- Did you see that?
Next.
- Dad!
- John.
- Freeze!
- Let me go!
John!
- Where's the Porsche?
- The Porsche. Get in the car.
Little punk.
Who... Who are you?
I'm a friend of your daddy's.
- He's got my son.
- What son, Nash?
There's nothing in your file about a son. You're a a fuckin' liar!
Nash, what son?
Please, stop the car! Please!
Let me outta here!
- "Let me out of here. Please, stop the car. "
- Stop!
Please! Look at the plane!
There's a plane!
No!
Whoo!
I ain't missin' my plane!
Whoa! Whoa!
You take the wheel!
Watch out!
Give it back!
Ohh! Mother!
Okay, guys,
I'll take it from here.
Okay.
Good luck, Lieutenant.
So, Nash, talk to me.
We've got plenty of time.
Whoo!
- Hey! Aaah!
- It's a truck! Stop!
Help!
This is fuckin' bullshit.
Without a confession, we got nothin' on this guy.
So if we can't charge him, he's gonna have to release him.
Pretty stuffy, eh?
Need a little ventilation, eh?
There goes!
Now, first rule of safety:
Keep your eye on the road!
What's that? It's a wall!
Okay, Nash, you're free to go... for now.
- Oh, yeah. One more thing.
- What?
One day you'll make a mistake, and when you do, I'll nail ya.
I've heard that before.
Let the fucker go.
Your daddy can't save you now.
MacLeod... or Highlander... whatever you're going by these days.
- It's your boy.
- Dad!
I hope I wasn't too hard on him.
I'm at the old mission.
Route 1. Jersey City. Do come.
Dad!
Ah, the importance of teaching young people family values. Hah? Smoke.
- Don't touch him.
- Ha-ha! Little punk.
- Come here, John.
- Go see your father.
Ohh!
Disappearance in the family.
It's funny. You know, I... I thought immortals couldn't have children.
But it seems that while
I'm the master of illusion, you are turning out to be the master of deception, Highlander.
How did you do it? How did you convince all those lovely women of yours... that they were the ones that couldn't bear children?
When all the while it was you and your little immortal pecker... that really didn't do the pecking.
Ohh. I know.
You must've been very disappointed.
All those nice years thinking you were the only one left.
But, you see, the prize was never yours.
And now, it never will be.
Amen.
Nice little speech, Kane, but it's not gonna save your head.
Where's John?
Oh. Well, come with me.
Come. Where's Johnny?
Here's Johnny.
Ahh.
Ooh.
MacLeod.
- What are you doing here?
- I followed you.
I... I just thought
I could help.
Aah!
Aw, shit!
Come on.
Come on. Come on.
Ooh, MacLeod.
You're such a lady-killer.
I can't kill an unarmed man.
Take it.
But then again, life isn't fair, is it?
I'll see you... in hell.
I'll be the judge of that.
There can be only one.
Dad?
Dad?
Oh, John.
Oh, John.
Will ya do somethin' for me, Connor?
In the years to come, will ya light a candle and remember me on my birthday?
Aye, love. I will.
There's a fresh breeze blowing off the loch.
The glen is snowy and cold.
It's the most glorious sight on Earth.
I've found no place to match it in 400 years.
I'm back now... with a woman I love and a son I've taken as my own.
I'm at peace.
It's finally over.
- You ready?
- Yeah. Boot it.
That's it.
That's it. That's it. Excellent.
I'm recording.
You crazy? Wait till
I get this thing down.
- What the fuck you doing?
- God damn, you stupid pussy.
- Fuck!
- Don't call me a pussy.
- I'll fucking ID you!
- Take the gun.
You're giving me this piece of shit?
Is it even loaded? I want the auto.
Asshole!
Whoo! I love this shit, man!
- Don't fuckin'...
- Fuck you!
- Right there. Turn left. Turn right.
- (Driver) OK, OK, just relax.
- Make a...
- Relax!
Here we go. There it is.
Shh.
- Easy. Take it easy.
- Don't make a fuckin' noise.
Go!
Go, go, go! Down! Down, you fucker!
I said down!
This is a robbery!
Everyone put your hands up!
Hands in the air! Hands in the air!
No, no, no, no, no.
Where you going, bitch? Over here!
- Get the fuckin' money!
- You! Open the fuckin' register!
You want to fuckin' die, you little fuck?
Please! Please, don't shoot!
Here we go!
- Don't shoot us. Don't shoot.
- Come on! This way!
- OK!
- Go, man. Run!
Run, man, run! Run, man!
(2nd robber) Go, go, go, go, go!
Don't look at me, you fuckin' chink!
- Get in there!
- Get him inside!
- You get the money?
- (All) Yes!
- What are you doing, you asshole?
- Come on, we gotta go!
You get the money?
How much? How much?
- (Sirens)
- It's the police!
Fuck! I'm going. I'm going.
Um... fuck. Here. Come on, come on, follow me, man.
Wait!
Go, man, go! Come on...
The fucking doors are locked!
Come on! Come on!
Where are the cops, man?
- (Gunshot)
- Fuck you!
- What are you doing, man?
- Go, man! Just go!
- Shit!
- (Gunshots)
Go!
- (Cop) Drop your weapon!
- Come on! They're right behind us!
- Come on! Come on!
- Oh, shit!
- Go, man!
- Come on. Let's go.
Come on! Come on, jump!
- This is insane, man.
- (Cop) You! Stop, asshole!
Come on, grab my hand!
I'm gonna die! I'm gonna die!
- You motherfucker!
- (Gunshot)
Uhh...
God damn it!
You know I don't deal in snuff!
Don't have a fucking coronary, man.
I hate the zap when they die.
It just brings down your whole day.
- Jesus, Tick.
- Sorry (!)
How come the cops didn't put that tape into evidence?
With all the blood, they didn't see the rig.
- How'd it get to you?
- I got ways, Lenny.
Some of the paramedics - my guy pages me and I picked it up at the morgue.
What do you think? This clip's got to be worth a grand, right?
Tick, not to dash your hopes, but
I don't deal this kind of product.
I'll give you four. I gotta cut the last part. My customers want uncut.
Fuck that. The last part's the best.
Dry dive six stories and blammo!
Jacked into the big black.
I don't deal black-jack clips!
It's policy. I got ethics here.
Oh, yeah? When did that start?
Lenny, this is what people wanna see.
- So lay it off to somebody else.
- Lenny, Lenny...
I gotta get my rig fixed, there's blood all over the heads.
- Get away.
- Gimme six, it's a good clip.
It gets you pumpin'.
The first part's OK.
It's better than your usual soaps.
Now, that is cold.
I always bring you choice.
Sure, like this low-grade shit here?
Some girl fighting her boyfriend.
Nothing happens. I'm snoring.
Lenny, you're always telling me, bring you street life, real life,
that one man's desperate existence is another man's Technicolor.
- I said that?
- Many times. That's a direct quote.
I'll take it for five.
You'll make out OK.
It's pure cream.
No cutback to the wearer.
- Yeah, that's for sure. OK.
- What else you got?

(Man) Let me get this straight.
You'll pay me $200 to put on a hairnet and bang some beautiful babe?
I got to think about this.
Let's wire you up.
I hope this grease on your hair doesn't screw up the squid receptors.
What is all this squid shit, anyway?
Superconducting quantum interference device. Squid.
The receptor rig on your head sends a signal to the recorder.
We call it being wired, but there's no wire.
Keep the recorder five, six feet away max, in your jacket, by the bed, wherever you're gonna close escrow.
- Know what I mean?
- Yeah, right.
You got a half-hour of tape so give me some lead-in, but not too long.
- I ain't going out for popcorn.
- Don't worry.
- Got it?
- No problem.
You look great. You look...
You look beautiful.

Just what do you have in mind? '
Lenny...
God damn it, you gotta be there.
You got to help me.
Lenny, please pick up the phone.
Come on, pick up.
Come on, Lenny, fuckin' pick up the phone!
'OK, I'll call you back.'
Watch what I do. You OK?
You're doin' good, honey.
(Lenny) You look so good!
- Faith, come back.
- You all right?
Do you need help?
Sweetie, you're doing good.
Lenny...

(Man) Hey, Lenny...
(Woman) How you doin', man?
Keith.
- Keith?
- Yeah.
Lenny. Lenny Nero.
We spoke on the phone.
OK...
Not to be rude, Keith, but I got to ask. Are you a cop?
I understand. No, I'm not.
You understand. Attorney, right?
Attorney?
- Right?
- That's right.
Tassel shoes! Entertainment law would be my guess.
It's my job to know people and what they want, what's behind their eyes.
OK, so tell me, have you... have you ever jacked in?
Have you ever wire-tripped?
Uh, no. No.
A virgin brain? Good.
Well, we'll start you off right.
Save us some time.
Tell me what you know.
Just what I've read, that the technology was developed for the Feds to replace the body wire,
and now it's gone black market.
That's right, so...
This conversation's not taking place, OK?
- You're damn right.
- Good, good.
So do I get the deck from you?
I'll get one at cost.
My thing's the software.
- Clips, right?
- Clips. Right.
Listen, I want you to know what we're talking about here, OK?
This is not "like TV only better."
This is life.
It's a piece of somebody's life.
It's pure and uncut, straight from the cerebral cortex.
You're there. You're doing it.
You're seeing it. You're hearing it.
You're feeling it.
What kind of things... exactly?
Exactly anything.
Whatever you want, OK?
Want to go skiing without leaving your den, you can,
but I'm assuming a guy like you, you wanna go skiing, you'd fly to Aspen.
That's not what you're interested in. It's, uh...
It's about the stuff that you can't have, right? The forbidden fruit.
Like running into a liquor store with a.357 Magnum, feeling the adrenaline pumping through your veins, huh?
Or... see that guy with the drop-dead
Filipino girlfriend?
Wouldn't you like to be that guy for 20 minutes, the right 20 minutes?
Yeah.
I can make it happen and you won't even tarnish your wedding ring.
- Sounds good.
- See, I can get you what you want.
I can get you anything.
Just talk to me.
You have to trust me, cos I'm your priest.
I'm... I'm your shrink.
I am your main connection to the, uh... switchboard of souls.
I'm the magic man.
Santa Claus of the subconscious.
You say it, you think it, you can have it.
You want a girl?
You want two girls?
I don't know what your thing is, what you're curious about.
You want a guy?
Maybe you want to be a girl. Hey...
Think of that. Be a girl.
See what that feels like.
Maybe you want a nun to tie you up.
It's all doable.
Talk to me about costs.
Before we get to numbers, I want you to try a taste. I got a deck with me.
- Right here?
- Step into my office.
Ohh.
Mmm.
Ooh.
You were just an 18-year-old girl taking a shower.
You're beginning to see the possibilities here?
Hey. So, where is he?
He's in the back, making a deal.
Next time, let's meet someplace private.
Cops have more to worry about than the squid trade.
Oh, yeah? Assume the position, you miserable techno-perv puke.
Beat it, fuckwad!
Max, I was with a client.
You think that's funny?
Prick.
See that preppy puke's face?
Pissed all over his topsiders!
OK, it was funny, but it could cost me money.
Come on, amigo. No one knows how to work them like you do.
You could sell a rat's asshole for a wedding ring.
I could.
- Let me buy you a drink. Bobby!
- Bobby!
Bobby!
Tequila, por favor. Double shots.
Make it a Tres Generaciones.
Nothing but the best for Lenny, the finest cop to ever get thrown off the vice squad.
- Fuck you.
- (Laughs)
Yeah. Nice tie.
- Thanks, Max.
- You dress like a fucking pimp.
- It cost more than your wardrobe.
- That's not saying much.
It's the one thing that stands between me and the jungle.
The jungle, where some bird can cap you in the head and ruin your day.
- You were lucky, Max.
- So darn lucky...
I wake up with a.22 in my brain and a cop pension I can't live off of.
Damn! It's a good thing
I wasn't luckier.
Bobby, hit me again.
- You seen Faith lately?
- No, she won't call me.
It's just as well.
Sure, Faith was the best woman you could ever hope to get, and it's...
humiliating that she's gone, but you got to face that it's over.
Thanks, chaplain.
I'm touched by your concern.
I just hate to see you pining away.
You're my friend.
It makes me want to vomit.
- Hey, Iris. You OK?
- I got to talk to you.
What happened?
Some john get rough on you?
No. Can we talk in private? Please?
I'm in trouble. So is Faith.
- There's the magic fucking word.
- Come with me to your car.
- There's something you have to see.
- What's going on?
It's a bad situation.
- What?
- If they get me, I know they'll...
Who?
- (Siren)
- Oh, shit.
Hang on! That's my car!
Not any more. It belongs to the bank.
Hey, wait a second.
- Whoops.
- Oh, yeah.
Two million years of human evolution, that's the best you can come up with.
What do you get to repo a car?
I'll pay you 350 right now.
- You got the cash?
- I was gonna write you a cheque.
- See ya.
- I respect that. I would want cash.
They'll take my cheque inside.
Just give me two minutes.
Here. You can keep my watch for collateral.
It's... It's a Rolex.
I'll be right back. Two minutes.
Two minutes?
Son of a bitch!
What happened to your car this time?
See, Lenny, if you packed your piece, you could make the guy see sense.
Bobby, turn this up.
# You watch us take it all then you'll understand our pain
# We'll make you the rat that crawled through the cracks
# You love that red, white, and blue
# But you hate the black, black, black
# And you try to make me think
I did this to myself
# When the drugs I smoke and the guns I tote both came from your shelf
# I never had a dream, cos
# My life is a nightmare
# America's been my bogeyman for 400 years #
'Are you asking me how I feel? '
'We felt Jeriko. We listened to him! '
'The LAPD is a military force
'turned against its own people.
'We live in a police state... '
Hey, Macey.
Shh.
'... with their social programmes that don't work.'
'They're rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic.
'But a new day is coming.
'2K is coming.
'The day of reckoning is upon us.
'History ends and begins again...
'right here... right now.'
Right on! To the end of all things.
You know how I know it's the end of the world?
- No. Tell me.
- Everything's already been done.
Every kind of music's been tried, every government's been tried, every fucking hairstyle, bubble gum flavours, you know, breakfast cereal.
What are we going to do? How are we going to make another thousand years?
I'm telling you, man, it's over.
We used it all up.
- So, what's this week's sad story?
- They jerked my wheels.
It's outrageous the computer errors the banks make. Have you noticed?
No, I haven't, because I make my payments.
So, Max Peltier, how's the PI business?
Sucks. But when I get this new logo...
I want to hear this scumbag.
- 'Do you have any leads? '
- 'Was there adequate security? '
'There was adequate security available. He chose not to have it.'
- Why is he a scumbag?
- You-know-who left Lenny for him.
- Faith left Lenny for him?
- Don't say Faith.
You use the "F" word around Lenny, you got to tranquillise him.
Shh!
'I know I've lost a friend.
'A man of great courage, which is more than I can say for most of us.'
- If you're riding...
- OK, let's go.
Fuck you, you pig!
(Macey) Driving Mr Lenny.
It's gonna be a big night.
Feel the energy in the air.
There's money to be made, dreams to sell.
- Sleaze to peddle.
- That is so unenlightened.
I sell experiences.
The way I see it, I'm performing a humanitarian service.
- I probably save lives.
- I don't want to hear this.
Everybody needs to walk to the dark end of the street sometimes.
The risks... The streets are a war zone. Sex can kill you.
Slip on the 'trodes, get what you need almost as good as the real thing and a lot safer.
Porno. Face it, you sell porno to wireheads.
Harsh. Harsh and untrue.
My clients are professionals.
Some are even celebrities.
- What celebrities?
- The guy from the news.
- He does the weather.
- That counts.
- Hey, you passed La Cienega.
- I'm not taking La Cienega.
It's the quickest way to the club.
I've got business there.
I'm meeting people.
Mace, you're my friend.
I'll give you 25% of what I make tonight.
This may be hard for you, but friends don't have to pay their friends.
- Faith's singing there tonight.
- I should have known.
Look, I've pulled 12 hours.
I got to get some sleep.
I got a pick-up at the St James Club.
You can catch a cab. It'll take you wherever you wanna go.
A taxi? Well, someone might see me.
(Cop) Hold it right there, ma'am.
Whoa. Hold it right there.
- You made me late.
- What's your pickup's name?
- Fumitsu.
- Fumitsu?
Fumitsu. Fumitsu.
(Cop) Leave the car right here.
- Oh, fuck.
- (Cop) Get the one on the right.
- Nero.
- Strickland.
Commissioner Strickland.
Since you shit-canned my career,
I don't even have to call you sir.
Aren't you a little far from your usual gutter?
I was invited here by a friend,
Mr Fumitsu. He's over there.
I don't like disappointments. You know what disappoints me very much?
Your sex life? Excuse me.
Mr Fumitsu.
- Konbanwa.
- Konbanwa.
Leonard Nero, BLS Limousine and Security Service.
I've arranged for one of our finest drivers Lornette Mason to take you.
She's a security specialist, trained in defensive combat,
and the car's bulletproof and fully armoured.
I'll be coming along to do our routine periodic driver evaluation.
We do it to ensure that our VIP clients are always treated as honoured guests.
Good evening, Mr Fumitsu.
Sir, please watch your head.
Excuse me, Mr Nero.
Excuse me, sir!
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Coming with you.
You will not live to see the morning.
Drive on.
- (Fumitsu speaks Japanese)
- Are you a cop?
No? Good. Have you ever been wired?
(Fumitsu) Wired?
- The latest technology.
- Oh...
That is beautiful.
You got to take a look at this, OK?
Yeah.
- You're gonna love it.
- You have more?
I have more. Believe me.
Hey! Hey! Careful on the jacket.
It's Armani.
- Hey, are you angry?
- No wirehead shit in my car!
- You're on foot!
- In LA? Are you crazy?
Can I come in? I'm having a hard time hearing the stereo!
I need my case.
It's still in the back.
Can we talk here, like two rational adults?
Uhh!
Um, that would be no.
OK, you got my attention.
This is cutting off the circulation in my head. Do you mind?
Macey...
It's cool, it's nothing. Two seconds.
This is uncharacteristic for you,
Miss Ice Water In Her Veins.
You pushed me too far! You made me lose it in front of a client!
- I could get fired!
- Are we still friends?
Friendship is more than one person doing favours for another.
- I know.
- I don't hustle my friends.
You just suck people along with your schemes and your slick act.
- We're still buddies?
- Don't use the time I'm talking to think about what you're gonna say next.
- You listening?
- Yeah.
You're always broke, you go from one score to the next.
You're strung-out.
You don't even see it.
It's your brain, so do whatever the hell you want with it, but not on my watch.
I got a child, I got rent,
and I got an ex-husband doing hard time who doesn't send me a dime.
I'm just trying to hold on here.
I know you wouldn't say this if you didn't care about me. Thanks.
You're getting out with Fumitsu, and that's the end.
I'll get you to the Templars in ten minutes.
- Sorry for the inconvenience.
- I'm changing my plans.
Mr Nero has recommended an excellent club, the Retinal Fetish.
- It's on La Cienega.
- Yes, sir.
- Enjoy your evening, Mr Fumitsu.
- Mace, I appreciate it. Thank you.
Hey, come on.
Excuse us.
Excuse us.
Excuse us.
This is a friend of mine, Mr Fumitsu.
Can you take care of him?
(Hostess) John, could you take care of this gentleman?
Hey. Bye.
- Hey, Lenny. How ya doing?
- Who's the new guy in Gant's posse?
Wade Beemer, played running back for the Rams, '96, '97.
Like a fucking freight train.
- Rams... Football, right?
- No, ping-pong(!)
Hey, Iris was looking for you.
Hello, Lenny.
It's OK, Wade, he's an old friend of mine, Lenny Nero.
Come to peddle me some clips for old time's sake,
or just makin' a few bucks for the holidays?
I wouldn't sell you the sweat off a dead dog's balls.
I've already got everything
I need from you.
Cut it out, Philo.
Too bad about your guy Jeriko.
You lost your golden goose.
Show some respect.
He was an important artist.
Important for your label, which is why you're mourning.
His records will sell out now he's dead, and you'll make out.
Always do.
Faith, can I talk to you for one second?
It's not a good idea right now.
Just for one second, OK?
- About what?
- That would be between me and Faith.
Funny, I don't feel anything between you and Faith.
You see...
that's your problem, Lenny, you assume too much.
You assume there's something where there's nothing, you assume that you have a life,
when in fact, you're just peddling pieces of other people's lives and the broken parts of your own.
Faith...
Get him to his car.
Call me, OK? Faith!
Call me!
Lenny the loser.
- Leave him alone, Philo, OK?
- You shouldn't talk to him.
You shouldn't talk to anybody, not with everything that's going on.
You are too goddam paranoid.
You know that, Philo?
Paranoia's just... reality on a finer scale.
Awoo! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
- Hey.
- Hey! What's up, my brother?
- Those rascals haven't grown back?
- No. Any day now. I just know it.
Hey, I got something for you.
It's a present, something I had custom-made.
- Happy Millennium.
- Oh.
I got something for you, too.
Just showed up tonight.
I don't know who from.
Fan mail from some flounder?
Mmm.
- Hi.
- Hi.
# Strange days not like before #
# I can hardly wait
# I can hardly wait
# I can hardly wait
# I can hardly wait
# It's been so long
# I've lost my taste
# Say angel, come
# Say lick my face
# Let fall your drapes
# I'll play the part
# I open this mouth wide
# Eat your heart... #
# Your heart
# I can hardly wait
# I can hardly wait
# I can hardly wait
# I can hardly wait
# Lips crack dry
# Tongue bursts
# Say angel, come
# Say lick my face
# It's been so long
# I've lost my taste
# Here, Romeo
# Make my watered brain #
Hi, baby.
I missed you.
Lenny, you have to leave. I mean it.
Iris said you were in trouble.
What did she mean?
- You talked to Iris? When?
- Tonight.
I haven't seen that girl in months.
Who knows what's going on in that whore's head?
She used to be your best friend.
Iris? You're really running out of excuses to come around, aren't you?
I know you. You're afraid of something. What's going on?
Let it alone.
It will take care of itself.
It's Gant, isn't it? He's poison.
He's got you walled in and he uses the wire too much.
He gets off on tape, not on you.
That's a good one coming from you.
- Why don't you just split?
- Cos I don't want to.
Do you love him? I don't think so.
To him, you're some kind of possession. You're like a Ferrari.
You're just something to show the other guys.
Yeah? He has his uses, too, you know.
What? He going to record you on his label?
He might.
You never know, right?
Faith...
Faith, listen to me. I've watched you create yourself out of nothing.
You're like a goddam cruise missile targeted on making it, and you will.
I know I will.
It's you up on that stage, not him.
You don't need him.
Get out of here. If Philo catches you, he'll hurt you.
- I'm already hurting.
- I'm serious. He's acting crazy.
He's doing way too much playback.
He's gotten completely paranoid.
He's such a control freak now, he's even paying Max to follow me around.
- Max? You're kidding.
- Yeah, for about a month now.
Jesus.
Look, Lenny, just stay away from Philo and stay away from me.
Stop trying to rescue me.
Those days are over.
I'm a big girl now. I've changed.
Stop trying to save me, I don't need saving. Just give up on me!
I just... I just wanted to make sure you were all right.
You know one of the ways that movies are still better than playback?
Cos the music comes up, there's credits,
and you always know when it's over.
It's over!
You were great.
Hey, man. I know what you're thinking.
- She told me about your new gig.
- Man, I feel like shit about it.
- You should feel like shit.
- I do feel like shit. OK?
- Hey, you introduced me to Gant.
- I introduced him to Faith, too.
Qçuestionable move, given the historical perspective.
I can take his money. You wouldn't believe what I'm charging.
And I make sure Faith is OK at the same time.
Keep an eye on her, for you. OK?
Which you can't do without getting your fingers bent the wrong way back.
I'm busted, man. I need the money.
- This does us both some good.
- Fairly twisted logic, even for you.
- Hey, you got a job.
- I got a job.
OK. I'm sorry. You got a job.
- That's great.
- I got a job!
Hey, listen. You got to stay on her.
Watch her for me, please.
- I'm on her.
- OK.
- Take it easy, all right?
- Yeah. You, too.
Come on.
Here, chicky, chicky, chicky, chicky, chicky...
Hey, wait a minute. I recognise you.
You're Wade Beemer, right?
Running back for the Rams. '96, '97.
- Am I right?
- Yeah. Th-That's right.
I saw you play, man.
I mean, you were good, really good.
Like a fuckin' freight train.
What happened? Injuries or what?
- Oh, bullshit politics.
- It's always politics.
Like this thing.
He's paying you to tune me up.
I could pay you more not to.
- I could write a cheque right now.
- Ah... I got to go.
OK. Cash... Cash!
Here's everything I have on me.
Oh, look. What do you say?
How about, uh, a Rolex?
I got a real one.
Come on. It won't hurt too bad.
It's nothing personal.
Just one second, please.
It's my jacket. It's...
It's really expensive.
And just not... not the eyes.
You're bleeding.
Some jerk puked on the stairs, and I slipped. I should sue.
You came back for me.
I came back to pick up my client.
No, you came back for me.
I got to lie down, Macey, please, in the back?
Some piece of work, Lenny Nero.
You're calmly backstroking along in the big toilet bowl, and somehow, you never let it touch you.
I mean, between working vice and your current so-called occupation, you must have seen every perversion.
But you just like some Teflon man.
Still come out this... goofball romantic.
It's my sword and my shield, Macey.
All right. A little B & E action.
- What'd you say?
- Oh, nothing.
Shit.
No, no.
Please. Please.
Please...
You can let me go, please.
I haven't seen your face. Please.
L-Let me go.
Let me go, please...
Oh, my... Holy...
- (Gasping)
- Lenny...
Lenny!
Go to the Sunset Regent right now.
Go! Go!
Oh, Christ.
He's jacking it into his own output!
She's seeing what he's seeing.
She's... She's seeing herself!
Ohh...
My God...
God! (Gasps)
Oh, my God... Oh, my God...
Lenny... What is it?
- A black-jack.
- Black-jack?
A snuff clip.
It was Iris.
- The sick fucker killed her.
- Are you sure it's real?
(Cop) Tell 'em we got a 187.
Call it in.
Well, I lost my appetite... for about a year.
- Wanna take a look?
- Hell, no. I don't fool with that.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
- You OK?
- No. Not really.
All right. Let's work it.
No, I... I can't.
Come on, Lenny, you used to be good at this shit.
Let's play it down.
What's the perp doing?
- I can't.
- You used to be a fuckin' cop, OK?
Now, that is a fucking murder.
- What's he doing?
- OK. H-He stalks her.
And, uh... he rapes her... and he does her.
And records it, right?
He wants to see it again and again.
He records himself raping and killing.
- While sending a signal to her.
- So she feels what he feels
while he's inside her.
The thrill while he's killing her is sent to her, heightening her fear, which, in turn, heightens the turn-on for him.
I've seen... I've seen a lot.
- So have I. Too much.
- It's a bad one.
He makes her see her own death, feeds off the reaction.
He records it all. Everything.
- And gives it to you.
- Yeah. He wants to share it.
Of course he wants to share, man.
That's his deal.
He needs an audience.
This is a sick puppy.
- Why me?
- Cos you're the magic man, Lenny.
You make dreams happen.
If it's got something to do with the wire, it washes up on your beach.
I've never dealt in black-jacks.
Never. Everybody knows that.
He's just skull-fucking you, buddy.
He just wants a reaction out of you.
He wants to make you do something that you do not want to do.
Maybe he figures Lenny will appreciate what he's created.
It's the dark end of the street.
How do you like it now?
- Jesus, Mace, back off.
- This guy's one of your squid-heads.
- He's somebody you know, Lenny.
- The problem with that is
Lenny knows... everybody.
- Take the tape to the cops.
- No.
No. I'll... They'll crucify me.
So this wire-freak gets to keep running around, huh?
The police will think he's the perp.
They'll go through his client list, and ruin his life... such as it is.
I'll call my buddies at homicide, say Iris was my friend.
That'll put me in the loop. I'll get the forensics and all that shit.
Get some sleep. I'll call you when I get something. Relax!
Lenny!
Keep moving, man.
Somebody's thinking about you a lot.
Leave me alone!
Don't come to my house.
Are you trying to ruin my life?
Iris is dead. She was murdered.
- Who did it?
- Whoever he is, he's damaged goods.
Iris said you were in danger, too.
- I'm not in any danger.
- Faith! No more games.
Whatever you're hiding you have to get out of here. Come with me now!
Then what? Are you gonna protect me?
Are you a tough guy?
You're a fucking talker.
You don't even own a gun.
I have a gun under my bed.
You don't know what you're fucking with here.
- Tell me.
- (Philo) Tell him, Faith. Go on.
Uh, listen. Lenny just stopped by to give me some bad news, OK?
An old friend of mine's been murdered. Remember Iris?
How the fuck did you get up here?
Charm.
Tell you what, Lenny.
Just for you, hmm?
Make you a deal.
Why don't you just take her? Hm?
If she's so unhappy and she wants to leave, she can go!
Besides, Faith always knows what she wants. Don't you, baby?
See? Hands off.
I'll tell you something else.
I'll tell you this, you fuck.
If she says she stays, you go.
You crawl back to wherever the fuck it is you came from and never cross my vision again.
Faith...
Come on.
Come on...
I've made my choice, Lenny.
Get him out.
Get him out!
You're fucking crazy, Faith!
You're fucking crazy! Come with me!
Faith!
I don't love you any more.
Do you understand that?
You mean nothing to me!
Leave me alone, Lenny, please!
You said you were gonna get Iris out of this, Philo.
Now you understand the danger we're in.
So sweet what you said out there, so touching. I almost believed it.
I don't think he even understands you did it for him.
He doesn't know what's going on.
Leave him alone!
I'd love to leave him alone
if he'd stop coming round and you'd stop talking!
The only time a whore should open her mouth is when she's giving head.
Shit! Mace! Help!
Don't be shy, Lenny.
This is your floor.
Come on now, Lenny.
You're going to the hospital.
(Lenny) Can we be smart here?
I could make it worth your while.
I don't mind a couple of shots.
Just go light is all I'm saying.
Here, look. Take my Rolex.
Ooh, nice watch.
- Is this impact resistant?
- Sure.
You stupid piece of shit!
You stupid fuck. Get up!
Come on. Get up!
(Corto) Oh, ho. Pain. Pain!
We tried to find a smaller girl to beat the shit out of you, but it was short notice.
It was short notice!
Oh! Ow! That one had to hurt.
Safety's on.
Come on. Let's go.
Hey, wait!
- I need a drink.
- Lenny, get some rest.
The cops know they'll never nail this guy the second they walk in the room.
It's all about what they see walking in... dead hooker, handcuffs, penetration.
Cops are lazy, and they know nobody gives a shit about a dead hooker.
They're roadkill, right?
So they'll take pictures, make jokes,
and just shrug it off like it's a random kill.
- It's the kind you never solve.
- That doesn't add, does it?
Iris said she knew somebody was after her. That is not random.
If they get me, I...
She said "they". "If THEY get me."
Which means this whole random sex killer thing is bullshit.
- Somebody whacked her for a reason.
- So this guy's not a psycho?
He's a psycho.
To do what's on that tape,
he's not a well-adjusted human being.
I got to get some sleep.
OK, Lenny. Put that down, and I'll check on you tomorrow.
Hey, you wanna rub my neck?
- (Sighs)
- My shoulder's real sore.
OK. All right. Come here.
- Right here?
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.
Ohh...
Don't stop.
How's Zander?
Oh... He's fine.
- I miss him.
- He misses you, too.
I'm real sorry about being so hard on you earlier.
I just see you getting sucked into this deeper and deeper, and, um...
Macey, come on.
I know you still love me.
How can you do this in front of your child?
In front of your son.
- Mace, hold on. Mace...
- In front of your son!
Zander!
Zander!
"When a child loves you for a long, long time,
"not just to play with, but really loves you..."
- Hi, honey.
- Hi, Mommy!
- This is Lenny.
- Hi.
'Hi, it's Lenny.
Just what do you have in mind? '
(Max) 'Hey, the last day of the world and you spend it in bed? '
- What's up, Max?
- Not a whole lot, man.
They've just been saying words over Jeriko.
Tension's running pretty high down here.
- Faith OK?
- Yeah.
She's leaving with Gant, so I got to boogie.
Iris checked into the Regent last night under a false name. Paid cash.
- So she was hiding out.
- Yep.
I heard you dropped in on Gant last night.
- 'Another slick Lenny move, huh? '
- He's in this somehow.
'Just stay close to Faith, OK? '
No worries, bro. I gotta jam.
What up, Lenny?
- So, where we going?
- Anywhere.
- You're acting strange, what's up?
- Shh, Mace.
We'll talk about it in the car.
Hand me that box of tapes.
- Oh, shit.
- What's the matter?
This tie doesn't go with blue.
(Macey) Lenny, would you relax?
We're not being followed.
- Stop being so paranoid.
- The guy had a knife to my throat in my living-room.
Relaxing might be right out, OK?
Oh, man. Oh, that is one unbelievable piece of eye-fuck.
Skip the art criticism, Tick. What can you tell me about the wearer?
That guy is fucked up.
- We know that.
- He has some distortion in the visual cortex.
The colour and grey-scale values are messed up, like colour-blindness.
See the peak period ratios? There could be a tumour or brain lesion.
Whoever's doing this is using a box to split the signal...
- Ever make a box like that?
- A few. I can't see if it's mine.
I don't like this.
- This is not good.
- What?
It's cutting close to me.
She was just here, man!
- Who?
- Iris!
- Iris was here?
- She was shaking like a junkie, saying she wanted me to copy some clip.
- What clip?
- I don't know.
She said I wouldn't wanna see it.
She was gonna give it to you.
- She never gave me a tape.
- Think back to what she said.
She came in. She was crying.
She wanted to go to my car.
Let's go to your car.
There's something you have to see.
- Something about my car.
- In your car.
That's a handy little attitude adjuster.
Damn. I'm boxed in.
- What's it say?
- Nothing.
Let's go play this back.
- Give us the tape right now.
- I'm just tryin' to get my car back.
Shut the fuck up.
- Give him the tape.
- It's in my case.
I'm gonna open my case.
Facing us, so we can see it.
Take it and turn her loose, OK?
Yeah. Absolutely.
"Oh, no. No.
We're not being followed, Lenny."
"Don't be paranoid."
Shit!
- The glass is bullet-resistant.
- Whatever happened to bulletproof?
Shit!
Calm down. This is what I do.
Hang on!
Christ.
Shit!
God damn it. 911 is busy.
It's all right, Lenny.
They'd never make it in time.
It won't open!
Oh, you're crazy.
Oh, God!
- This is bad.
- The gas tank's gonna go any second.
Hold on.
Are you out of your fucking mind?
The fire is out, isn't it?
Get in here, Lenny.
Come on! Move it! Move!
Get ready to hold your breath.
Just kick out hard and follow me, OK?
Let's get out of here.
I can't believe you had to give them the damn tape.
Yeah. Me neither.
It was one of my favourites.
Me and Faith in the hot tub on my birthday.
Are we impressed yet?
Yeah.
Pretty impressed.
# Here we kitty come, come, here we kitty come, come... #
Well, I'm missing the party of the century, hauling your asses around...
- Hey, Curtis. Just drive, all right?
- This shit is wack.
- Those two guys were cops.
- You sure?
It's the walk. Anyway, they'll get your address. We got to keep moving.
#... that crawls through the cracks, you love that red, white... #
What you doing all wet?
What's up? Zander, we're going to Aunt Cecile's house.
- We'll see the fireworks from there.
- Aw, Ma.
Come on, boy. Chop chop.
Come on, Zander.
We're going for a ride, OK?
- I want to know what's going on.
- Get in the car, Cecile...
- What's goin' on?
- Now.
Yo, what's up? How y'all doing?
- Yo, Mace. What's up?
- Hey, Ronnie.
- You never come around here no more.
- I'm working, brother.
- This is Lenny. He's with me.
- What's up?
- Watch the fireworks, baby.
- How you guys doing?
- Hey.
- Hey.
Good seeing you.
Tell me.
I can't tell you.
- You gotta see it.
- I'm not doing it.
I know what you think about the wire, but you gotta see it.
It's that important.
OK?
I'm sorry this has to be your first playback.
It's all right. Keep your eyes closed, or you'll see double.
- (Music on car radio)
- (lris) Mm, baby, yes!
(Man) I wanna thank you, Jeriko!
I owe you one for this, my brother.
(Jeriko) You owe me two, you bastard. That's right!
(Man) I owe you three, four, five, and six!
(lris) Hey, baby.
What you doin' back there?
(Replay) Yes. Yes. Yes.
Oh, yeah, baby.
Lights! Damn. Look at this, man.
- Oh, god damn, man!
- Hey, just be cool, Jeriko. Yo.
(lris) Slow down.
(Jeriko) I'm not speeding, man.
Man, what's the matter?
A black man can't own no jeep, huh?
(Cop) Pull all the way to the foot of the ramp.
No problem.
You know how it is.
If we be cool, they gonna be cool.
I can't afford no trouble.
I'm upset.
A man can't do shit in this town.
I ain't going back, Iris. I don't give a fuck. I ain't going back.
(Cop) Driver, step out of the vehicle.
Get down on your knees. Put your hands behind your head... now!
(2nd cop) Everyone else, out of the car.
Damn, man. What the hell you pull me over for?
If I went slower,
I'd have been parked.
Get down on your knees, put your hands behind your head.
Put your hands on the hood of the car.
Don't move. You, too.
I suppose you had suspects fitting our description in the area.
Is that it? What was the description?
Two black males in a car?
Right(!)
Ow! Fuck!
You know what? You pulled over the wrong black male tonight, officer...
What is it? Steckler.
Officer Steckler!
I'm that 800-pound gorilla in your mist.
I make more money in a day than you make in a whole year.
My lawyer loves spending my money dragging Aryan, Robocop fuckers like you into court.
Get a man down on the ground with no probable cause.
- Shut the fuck up.
- He didn't...
Shut up and get back over there!
- You all right, man?
- Motherfucker kicked me, man.
- It's that rap-ass.
- You're that rapper puke.
Jeriko One?
You're the one that's been getting all the gangbangers together, forming citizen groups, trying to rake the LAPD over a cheese grater?
Yeah. That's right.
And you gonna be in my next song.
It's gonna be called Robo-Steckler.
It's all about a cop who met his worst nightmare, a nigger with enough political juice to scrunch his ass like a stink bug.
- You gonna be famous, fucker!
- I don't think so.
(Cop) Stop that bitch!
Oh, no!
- Get her!
- Oh, no. Fuck.
There she goes! Get her!
(Cop) You bitch!
Hang on. Hang on, Max.
Mace.
You see?
You had to see it.
I see the world opening up and swallowing us all.
Yeah. I know.
Max, are you there?
Meet me at Tick's in half an hour.
And, Lenny...
Don't get pulled over, OK?
Do you know what this tape could do if it got out?
Yeah, I got a pretty good idea.
People finding out... seeing... that the LAPD just flat-out executed Jeriko One.
Jesus.
Jesus.
- Maybe they ought to see.
- Maybe.
But tonight's probably not the best night.
Mace... Come on. We're rolling.
I don't think those cops did Iris.
Whoever Iris wore for killed her.
- Why?
- To break the trail.
If those cops had gotten her,
they'd have found out who she was wearing for and gone after them.
Our killer is as scared as we are, which makes him really dangerous, judging by how scared I am.
Move it up.
Let her go.
Sounds like Tick's already celebrating, huh?
- You're overdressed for this party.
- I want to look nice for you, Lenny.
Hey, Tick. I gotta talk to you.
He's been cooked off.
- Is he dead?
- No.
But his frontal lobes are like runny eggs.
They use an amplifier to boost the signal, and it fries his brain.
Tick!
It's Lenny!
Hey, Tick! Come on!
(Echoing) Tick, it's me, Lenny!
Come on. Wake up. Tick!
Come on!
Come on, Tick! Come on!
He's totally cut off from the outside world.
How long does it last?
Forever.
Those psycho cops are on a slash-and-burn to find the tape and cover their tracks.
Since Tick is a duplicator, they wanna find out if copies were made or who wired Iris.
It's not even homicide, since he's technically alive.
Yeah. That's right.
He's technically alive.
It seems sophisticated.
These are not subtle guys.
- There's more to this.
- What do you mean?
All I'm saying is, you don't know how high up the food chain this goes.
- I heard stuff.
- What stuff?
I heard stuff, smoke, rumours.
I've heard stuff.
I've heard stuff about a death squad.
They're a group of guys, cops, loyal to the hard-line school.
Guys who've had too many years of City Hall, review boards, and the goddam media pissing down their necks, suspending cops, tying their hands, while these same people are squealing, "Save us! Save us!
"Do something, you morons.
Crime is out of control."
- Bullshit. It's conspiracy paranoia.
- It's not about if you're paranoid.
It's about whether you're paranoid enough.
Christ.
Exactly. Get religion.
I love you like my own blood, Lenny,
but don't walk near me in public.
The only card we got is the tape.
Get it to the media.
Right.
You run that on the news, by midnight you got the biggest riot ever.
They'll see the smoke from Canada.
What are you saying?
Pretend it didn't happen?
- I didn't say that.
- It happened.
The LAPD executed an important black man.
Who are you to try to bury it?
...trying to rake the LAPD over a cheese grater?
You want blood running waist-deep in the storm drains, go do it.
200,000 gangbangers will burn this city to the fucking ground, Mace.
Once the fire starts, the cops'll cap off anything that moves.
It'll be an all-out war.
I don't think so.
Maybe it's time for a war.
You really want that on your head, Mace, huh?
Really?
Whoever did Iris did Tick.
It's the same sick wirehead shit.
It's the same reason to burn the trail.
If Faith knows anything about this,
- and she does...
- Somebody's going to kill Faith?
# Yeah, you're not rid of me
# No, you're not rid of me
# I'll make you lick my injuries
# I wanna twist your head off, see?
# Till you say don't you wish you never, never met her?
# Don't you, don't you wish you never, never met her?
# Don't you, don't you wish you never, never met her?
# Don't you, don't you wish you never, never met her?
# Don't you, don't you wish you never, never met her?
# Don't you, don't you wish you never, never met her?
# Don't you, don't you wish you never, never met her? #
Jesus, Lenny, you scared the fuck out of me!
- What do you want?
- We know about Jeriko.
- Iris gave me a copy of the tape.
- I wanted to keep you out of this.
- How did it happen?
- Why was Iris with Jeriko, wired up?
Faith, listen...
Look at me. Look at me.
You gotta trust us.
We're here to help you.
All right. I'll talk to you alone.
- Mace is in this.
- Tell us.
Faith.
Philo, he's gotten obsessed with playback.
He's a total wiretrip junkie.
He's such a control freak now, he's been having people followed,
recording his business partners' calls, wiring up people left and right.
Philo and Jeriko weren't getting on.
He was afraid Jeriko would dump him, but he wasn't sure, so he starts with the surveillance.
A couple of nights ago, he wires up Iris,
and he sends her and the other girl,
Diamanda, over to Jeriko's table.
Hi, baby.
Hi. My name is Iris.
Hey.
(lris) I got a present for you.
And it's so beautiful.
So that night, Iris calls up crying.
She's freaking out.
She comes over and she plays the tape.
Philo loses it. He can't believe the disaster she's gotten him into.
'He's afraid the cops will beat it out of her
'who she's been working for, and then come looking for him.'
Why not go public, save himself that way?
If it got out he spied on his own artists he'd lose all his other acts,
and it'd be over for him.
'So he gives Iris some money.'
He tells her to check into a hotel under an assumed name
- until he can figure out what to do.
- He figured it out, all right.
- You think he killed her?
- The killer knew where she was because he put her there.
What a nightmare.
I don't know where the fuck she is, but we're late. Let's go.
Philo, how do you want me to work it tonight at the Bonaventure?
Downstairs, or upstairs at the suite?
Lenny.
Leave here with me right now.
Come on.
- We'll talk about that later.
- No, man. I need to know.
Joey, what the fuck you waiting for?
Get her. Go!
I just say things once, baby, OK?
So, we will talk about that... later.
Oh, OK, man. I'm cool. I'm cool.
I'm sorry, man.
Hey, Wade, go out for a pass, bro.
# Blue sky
# No white clouds in my blue sky #
- Oh, shit!
- Get out of my fuckin' way!
Come on! Come on!
Lenny! Go! Go!
Pardon me! Sorry! Sorry!
Get out of my fuckin' way! Move it!
Move!
Faith.
Hello, Lenny, you fuck!
Let's go, darling. Happy New Year!
- Get out of the way!
- Lenny...
Excuse me. Get out of my fucking way!
Vita... Vita, not now, baby.
Come on. Not here.
There he is.
Mr Gant, a few questions, sir?
Well, I'm certainly in the mood for a party (!)
- Wade, take her up to the suite.
- No problem.
You go and have a glass of champagne... or six.
See you up there in a bit, help you ring in the new year.
I live for the moment.
Pussy-whipped, sorry-ass motherfucker.
Take it easy.
So... So where are they now?
He's got her up in the room, under guard.
Uh, he's still working the party,
acting smooth like nothing's nothing.
So, buddy... I say we work a trade.
- What do you mean?
- Give him the clip.
The tape for Faith.
I know he'll go for it.
This is what we laughingly refer to as a plan?
Just get your butt down here.
If I'm not downstairs, go to the room. It's 2203. You writing?
If he gives us any shit... we kill them all.
What do you say?
Really scatter the pigeons.
We got to get over there.
Can you borrow a dress from Cecile or something?
- I'm not going.
- What do you mean?
- Gant's going to do her right there.
- Shut up.
Lenny, park your mouth and listen.
It's a set-up. Think about it.
Why is he sending tapes to you?
To freak you, get you to rush in, put a bullet in you, one in her,
- and the gun in your hand?
- Yeah, that sounds right. I'm going.
You going to get yourself killed for this? Huh?
For this toxic-waste bitch?
What the fuck are you doing?
This is your life!
Right here! Right now!
It's real time, you hear me?
Real time!
Time to get real, not playback.
You understand me?
She doesn't love you any more.
Maybe she did once, but she doesn't now.
These are used emotions.
It's time to trade them in.
Memories were meant to fade, Lenny.
They're designed that way for a reason.
Have you ever been in love with...
someone who didn't return that love?
Yeah, Lenny...
I have.
Didn't stop you from loving them, right?
Or being able to understand them or forgive them?
I guess.
Didn't stop you from wanting to protect them... did it?
When I met Faith, she was just another... another runaway... giving $20 blow jobs to buy crank.
Just another lost soul.
And she had this voice that was...
Well, that was scary.
Like she could take all the hurt and rage of the entire world and lift it up to heaven in one voice.
I helped her.
And I promised her that I'll always just be there... to protect her.
See, it's not about what's in her head. It's about what's in mine.
I can't let go of the promise.
It's like it's all I have left.
No, it's not.
Come on.
Let's go to a party.
The end of the world, yeah!
Shit!
Let's bail.
Hey, Mace...
You look great in that dress.
- I mean, better than I would.
- Thank you, I think.
Come on, let's go.
What's your plan for getting into the most sold-out party in history?
Relax, Mace. This is what I do.
- You see Gant?
- Uh-uh.
Shit.
Come on, Max. Come on, buddy.
Come on...
(Phone) 'The customer you have called is unavailable... '
I still got one ace to play. Gant has what I want, I have what he wants.
This is the original.
That's why it's a makable deal.
Look, this tape is a lightning bolt from God.
It's worth more than you, more than me, and more than Faith, you understand?
It can change things that need changing before we all go off the end of the road.
You do not have the right to use it for currency.
So if you go... you go alone.
You see, I care about you, Lenny, a lot more than you know, which makes us both pretty stupid, huh?
But if you pawn this tape... you mean nothing to me.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
You see that guy over there?
That's Deputy Commissioner
Palmer Strickland, the prick who busted me out.
His ass is so tight, only dogs hear his farts.
If there's a clean cop, it's him.
- Take it to him.
- You want me to trust a cop?
No. Trust me. Here.
What if you're wrong?
Go.
Excuse me.
Commissioner...
there's a clip in here that you need to see right now.
If it weren't New Year's Eve,
I'd have you arrested for possession of illegal equipment.
You wanna know who killed Jeriko, you go into that stall and hit "play."
(Cop) Sir, is there a problem here?
- Damn it, I knew it.
- Come on, let's go.
- Let go of me!
- Sir?
Wade, can we talk here like two human beings?
It's nothing personal.
Remember me, you fucking bitch?
Come on! Come on!
What are you looking at?
God damn it!
Enjoy the party.
Steckler... Steckler!
Fuck!
I didn't hear you come in.
Ah!
No!
No... no!
Shit.
OK?
Did I hurt you?
Huh?
I love you, Max.
You're so pretty, Faith.
Shit!
- Come here, you fucker...
- You want to fuckin' die?
You want to fuckin' die?
This piece of puke hired me to kill you. Can you believe that?
- Ain't that right?
- I can't believe this is happening.
Believe it!
Bring me the 'trodes and the deck. Qçuick!
Come here, big shot, suck on this.
You wanna suck on something?
What are you gonna do?
You can't just kill him, Max!
I'm not going to. Give me that.
Just a little poach job.
- (Gant groans)
- You shut the fuck up!
Shut up or I'll pull this fucking trigger!
- (Fireworks explode)
- (Faith) Fuck!
- Here's how much I love you, baby.
- God, Max!
Hope you enjoy the show, Philo... you fuck.
- Take it, you prick!
- No, Max, don't! Don't do it!
Take it! Take it!
Take it!
Don't make any assumptions about our friendship, OK, Lenny?
I didn't know you were colour blind, Max.
Only way I could stand your ties.
Manos arriba, amigo.
Ooh.
Glock.23.
Nice.
- Where's Faith?
- I sent her to the party.
- I'll wait here until you kill Gant.
- What makes you think I will?
You just did.
Jesus!
You know, that's the second most common word people say right before they die...
"shit" being number one.
So... I killed Gant, then you ran in, being on his payroll... and shot me.
That's just about the way it happened.
Wait. I killed Iris, too, didn't I?
They'll find the original of her snuff clip in your apartment.
The one I left at the club was a copy.
Was I a busy guy? Did I do Tick, too?
- Oh, you bet. Did you like it?
- So, why, Max?
- Why did you have to do Iris?
- Oh, picture it.
I got to share this with somebody cos it's just too perfect, OK?
- I won't say anything.
- Oh, I know.
I'm working for this puke who says he'll pay me large to do the hooker.
I also got to do his girlfriend
cos she knows the score and she's out of control.
Only he doesn't know about me and Faith.
So I say to myself,
"If I turn the job down,
"he'll get somebody else, and I lose Faith," to coin a phrase.
So to buy time, I do the skank, but I still got to deal with Gant.
It's him or me, but I can't cap him without some chump to take the fall.
And who better than his girlfriend's loser ex-boyfriend...
known criminal and who's been seen hassling him in public?
Who is, regrettably, also your best fucking friend.
No plan is perfect, Lenny.
Cheer up, the world's gonna end in ten minutes.
You must be so pleased.
I mean, I followed your jelly bean trail right here, like a good little chump.
- You got foggy on me a couple times.
- Oh?
Remember the death squad? I had to keep you from going to the cops.
I've heard stuff about a death squad.
It's not about if you're paranoid.
It's whether you're paranoid enough.
- So there never was a death squad.
- No.
Just two loose cops running round covering their butts.
Zany, huh? All this shit caused by a random traffic stop.
Nothing means nothing, man.
You know that.
Look around.
The planet's in fucking chaos.
The day of reckoning is upon us!
Get what you can while you can cos some shit can put a.22 in the back of your head... any second.
How'd you hook up with Faith?
Hmm...
This fuck hires me about a month ago to eyeball her, only...
Faith knows me from you.
She comes up and says,
"Max, why are you following me?"
And I say, "I'll buy you a drink.
I'll explain."
And she says...
(Faith) Do you enjoy watching me?
You're supposed to go downstairs, baby.
I know. I don't always do what I'm told, Max, you know that.
So I said, "Do you enjoy watching me?"
Come on, Max. Play with me.
And then what did you say?
I said I'd even do it for free.
Uh-huh.
I said, "That's good, because I like the feeling of someone watching me."
I acquired the taste from Lenny.
Then she said, "Since we're gonna be spending so much time together..."
"Why don't we make the best of it?"
The very best.
You know all about that, don't you, Lenny?
Faith and me, we found a place that you could never reach, Max.
Never.
Faith... I know it's gone...
but you, Max, you can't fucking touch it.
Enjoy it.
Lenny!
Get off, you fucking bitch!
God!
Fuck you!
What the fuck are you doing?
You're coming with me!
Ohh!
Come here. Come here, Lenny!
I'm taking you with me, you motherfucker! Come here!
Come here! You fuck!
Come here!
# They're selling Jesus again they want your soul
# And your money, your blood, and your votes

There she is!
Freeze!
I said, fucking freeze!
Down! All the way down! Right now!
Now pay attention, motherfucker!
Stay down.
Down! Down! Down! Down!
Down now! You son of a bitch!
You ain't goin' anywhere!
(Cop) Shut up and move!
Get back! In a circle!
Break this circle!
Put that gun down!
- Get on the ground now!
- Hold on. Hold on.
I'll tell you what's going on here.
Let me tell you what's going on.
Get on the ground now! Get down!
Let me tell you what happened, all right?
Get on the ground now!
All right?
Get these fucking things off me!
- No! Don't uncuff him!
- Shut up! Get down!
(Screaming) Wait!
You don't know what happened!
(Steckler) Fuck her up!
Hit her! Hit her!
Leave her alone!
Commissioner Strickland!
That is the cause of all this!
Right fucking there!
These two are under arrest for murder!
Read them their rights! Move it!
Yes, sir.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used against you.
You have the right to an attorney.
If you cannot afford an attorney...
Get this woman some medical attention.
(Man) Get some medical attention!
Mace, are you OK?
I got 'em.
Get the fuck outta here! Everybody!
Back the fuck up!
Drop your weapon!
Drop it now!
No! N0!
N0!
Put that gun down!
- Drop your weapon!
- Drop the gun now!
Now! Drop it!
- Put it down right now!
- Drop your weapon!
Shoot!
You fucking... nigger bitch!
Lenny!
Lenny!
Lenny! Lenny!
No, no, Lenny, Lenny...
Lenny! Lenny!
Yeah?
What?
Are we under arrest?
Nah, they just have to ask us a few questions... for about six hours.
OK, where are you hurt, sir?
Ma'am, you OK? Ma'am?
Yeah.
We need to get that coat off you.
Hurt anywhere else?
(Crowd) Ten! Nine!
Eight! Seven!
Six! Five!
Four! Three!
Two! One!
You need an ambulance, sir.
Let's go this way.
Go out this way, sir.
Hey, Lenny. We made it.
Yeah, we did.
You should get going.
Yeah. See you downtown.
See you there.
(Man) Make way.

'And it's Divorce Referendum in the lead, followed by Glory Be To God.
'Glory Be To God creeps ahead of Divorce Referendum.'
Come on, Divorce Referendum! Come on!
'Divorce Referendum is way in front.
'Divorce Referendum is speeding towards victory.'
- Yes, yes!
- 'Oh, no!'

(Man on radio ) 'So what role do you see the Church assuming?'
Hello, Ted.
What are you listening to?
Oh, it's just a programme about the Church and God and so on.
Oh, right. Right.
Where's Father Jack, Dougal?
- Where's Father Jack?
- Yes.
Father Jack, where is he?
He's in his... Oh.
- Erm...
- You've lost him again, right?
I have, Ted, yeah.
You took him out for a walk and you lost him...again.
That must've been what happened all right.
So what have you got to say for yourself?
Well, like I said the last time, it won't happen again.
Dougal, are you not going to go and look for him?
Ted, he'll come back.
What's the worst that can happen?
He could have an accident and be killed.
Oh.
Er, wait a second, Ted.
Is that not Jack there?
Ah, Dougal. You didn't even get him out the door, did you?
I thought the wheelchair felt a bit lighter today all right.
Come on, help me get him up.
- Dougal, take off his gloves.
- Right so, Ted.
- Ted.
- Hmm?
Ted, they're not gloves.
God, they're very hairy hands altogether, aren't they?
- What's wrong?
- I don't know.
Do you remember the time his head went septic?
Yes. I mean, I didn't think a whole head could go septic.
I mean, a whole head, you know?
But that's Jack for you.
I'd better look in the book.
Right.
Hold his hand up there, Dougal.
Well, he got up to stage four after drinking that brake fluid.
I think this could be a stage six.
- Hello to the lot of yous.
- Hello, Mrs Doyle.
Ah, would you look at him there with his hairy hands?
Yes, and we're going to have to call Dr Sinnot.
He's good. I had to go myself a couple of weeks ago.
Really? I didn't know you were ill.
What was the trouble?
A bit of a woman's problem.
I was having a bit of trouble...
I'd better ring him before it's too late!
- So it's the hairy hands.
- Yes.
- A stage six?
- It looks like it, yeah.
I'll get ready upstairs.
Ted, why is Jack so scared of doctors?
They remind him of illness and his own mortality.
He hated visiting the sick.
Oh, God, he hates the sick.
And the poor as well.
- The poor really got on his nerves.
- And the needy.
(Sighing) Them as well.
What was it he used to say?
He had a term for them.
- A shower of bastards.
- That was it.
When we bring the doctor in, just behave normal.
Just pretend he's a normal visitor.
We don't want Jack to suspect anything.
Doctor? Ready?
All right, in you go. Remember... completely normal.
So it's off to St Clabbert's again, Doctor?
Yes.
It's more for your sake than for his.
That hair thing can be very contagious.
- How long will they have him?
- Hard to say.
Could be for a while.
Actually, you should be prepared.
It might be better for his own sake if he doesn't come back.
Great! I mean, oh, no.
We'll just have to grin and bear it, I suppose.
I'll try and break it to him gently.
Thanks, Doctor.
Yes! Wahey!
Father Jack?
Do you remember that great time you had at St Clabbert's?
Remember the fun you had with those nuns fussing about you?
Dr Sinnot thinks another spell there would do a world of good.
Ok, it might mean giving up the odd glass of sherry or two, but that's all for your own good.
You'll have a fantastic time, it'll be one big laugh with all those nuns fussing all the...
Father? Father?
Where's he gone?
God, Ted, how did the sergeant catch Father Jack at all?
Well, Dougal...
He's an elderly priest driving a Flymo around a small island.
How hard could it be?
Anyway, he's up there in St Clabbert's now.
It's weird the way you get used to something.
Seems like only yesterday he was here drinking his head off.
Dougal, it was yesterday.
Yeah, but that's why I said it SEEMED like yesterday.
Right, because it WAS yesterday.
Yeah. What time are Father Rory and Father k en coming on Wednesday?
About six.
Six o'clock?
- Yes.
- Right. Good, good.
Actually, it's just as well
Jack's not here.
He can get very irritable around strangers.
Jack was very bad around strangers.
And people he knew.
Yes, very bad around strangers and people he knew.
- Anyway, night, Dougal.
- Night, Ted.
(Ted) Aw, damn!
No, Dougal, it's not morning.
I forgot to wind the clock.
Oh, right. Sorry about that, Ted.
Hello there, Father...
Father... Who are you?
Who are you?
Father Ted Crilly.
Very pleased to meet you.
Oh. What's this?
Oh, I see. It's from the Bishop.
You're taking Father Jack's place.
This is a surprise.
Has Mrs Doyle shown you around?
Well, anyway, welcome to Craggy Island.
The meals are at 11, one, half-two, three, five, seven and nine.
And if you ever want a snack, you can ask Mrs Doyle.
No, er... No, actually, that's actually mine.
Well, you go ahead there and have it anyway.
Dougal, this is Father Fintan Stack.
He'll be staying with us now.
Oh, right, yeah.
This is the brains of the operation.
Ah, no, that'd be Ted.
I wanna listen to some music.
Oh, go ahead, there.
I wasn't asking for permission.
So, erm... What do you think of Father Stack?
Well, erm...
It says in his note that they never found a suitable parish for him.
- He's not a very nice man, is he?
- I've never met anyone like him.
Who would he be like?
Hitler or one of those mad fellows?
Oh, worse than Hitler.
You wouldn't find Hitler playing jungle music at three in the morning.
God, he almost makes Jack seem normal.
You know, he nearly does.
Right, carry on.
I was going to say you'd almost miss Father Jack.
He had his funny little ways.
But whenever he'd hit you, he'd never do it out of spite.
He'd only do it because... he thought it was funny or whatever.
I suppose when you think about it now, it was funny.
Remember that time he gave you a big kick up the b-o-t-t-y?
And do you remember when you were bending over him, and he held your nose so tight that you had to open your mouth and then he dropped a big spider in it?
No, that wasn't funny, Dougal.
It was funny when he kicked you up the arse.
It wasn't funny when he put the spider in my mouth.
- It was, Ted.
- No, it wasn't, Dougal!
- Ah, Ted.
- Dougal!
Anyway, he's gone now.
It's funny how you miss someone's little ways.
God, I've had enough.
It sounds like someone drilling holes in a wall or something.
- I'll have a word.
- Careful.
Come on, I think he's out.
- What's up, Ted?
- Ted's gone mad.
- Lead on, MacTed!
- Shh.
- Right, the coast is clear.
- Father Jack's not here?
No, he has the hair thing again.
He's in Jurassic Park.
Oh, right. St Clabbert's.
Father Walton's up there, I hear.
- Sherry all right?
- Lovely.
Did you know Father Coogan at all, Ted?
Hmm... Oh, yes. Father Tom Coogan.
Wasn't he in Africa?
He was, with Father Shortall and that load.
Then he was back in Wicklow.
I think Windy Shepherd Henderson was his priest there.
Windy Shepherd Henderson that was in Tralee?
No, a different
Windy Shepherd Henderson.
- There's four of them.
- At least.
One of them was with
Father Daley in Chicago.
Wasn't he the first man on the scene when Malcom X was assassinated?
No, that was Father Burke.
Father Daley had the lump on his head in the shape of Connaught.
Like Father Caroline - he lost the use of his ears in an accident.
- He's deaf?
- No, just lost the use of his ears.
He used to be able to wiggle them.
Remember Father O'Reilly?
He's in Clare.
They moved him after he owned up to that OJ Simpson thing.
Father Bigley from Ardee did his wedding, I think.
- Father Bigley? Is he not dead?
- No, he just looked dead.
Ted, did you say
Father Larry Duff was coming?
God, I'd better give him a call.
I hope he can make it.
Larry is tremendous fun.
Ahh!
No, he must have it turned off.
God, I wonder where Dougal is?
Come on, Ted.
Shall we watch the sports video?
Oh, yes. Come on, Ted.
Ah, here's the lads.
And away they go!
Ah, look at your man at the back!
I remember this.
(All) Look at Mrs Doyle!
- She looks great on the telly!
- She's wearing the hat for a bet!
(Ted) I'd say so.
Oh, here's Buckin' Bronco!
Or Hopalong Cassidy.
- Here's the champ.
- Fair play. Fair play to him.
What are we watching?
We're looking at the sports day.
Lots of young fellows running around in shorts.
That's the kind of thing you like looking at.
And I bet you like that, too.
You're probably imagining what they'd look like without shorts.
You're sitting there, imagining that, with a big smile on your face.
You dirty fecker.
If you're trying to embarrass us, you're not succeeding.
Yes, I am.
Well, I have to say,
I think that you're a very rude man.
If you ever say that to me again,
I'll put your head through the wall.
- Dougal, where did you go to?
- Ted! How are you?
- Dougal, what the...?
- Yes? What, Ted?
- What?
- What?
- Have you been drinking?
- I have, Ted.
I been drinking like a mad eejit.
No, no, wait.
No, I haven't.
Dougal, I'm ashamed of you.
Ted, Ted, Ted.
Come here, Teddy, Teddy, Ted.
You're my best friend.
God, I love being a priest.
We're all going to heaven, lads, wahey!
Perhaps I should explain.
Your friend and I were enjoying a bottle of whisky I found upstairs.
Well, that is the last straw.
I'm driving. I'm driving home,
I'm perfectly capable.
By the way,
I got the keys of your car and I drove it into a big wall.
If you don't like it, tough.
I had my fun and that's all that matters.
- Ted, I can see up your trousers.
- Right. That's it.
I thought giving alcohol to Dougal was the last straw, but it was the second last straw, because this is definitely the last bit of straw in...the thing.
There is no more straw left!
- Ted, it's a little late.
- Yes, I think we should go.
- No, you don't have to go.
- I think we should.
Woooo!
Bye, girls!
Pair of wankers.
Oh! Come on, Dougal, we've had enough of Father Stack for one evening.
To the pub, Ted!
- Hey, Ted, what's going on?
- We're going to kidnap Jack. kidnapping, wow!
What will we get for him?
- Shut up, Dougal. You ready?
- I'm with you, Ted.
Right so, let's go, then.
Hello?
- This is a bit mad, Ted.
- Shh!
Why don't we ask the nuns to give him back?
Dr Sinnot said moving him might be dangerous.
Anyway, I got a second opinion.
- Who from?
- Mrs Doyle.
Ted, I'm not sure if this is a good idea. I mean, kidnapping!
It's not kidnapping, it's bringing him back to where he belongs.
It's like Lassie Come Home, with Father Jack as Lassie.
- Who are we, then?
- I don't konw. The other people.
You're Roddy McDowell and I'm Liz Taylor.
Fine. I just wanted to get that straight in me head.
- Right, let's go.
- Right.
- Come on, Dougal.
- (Shouting) Right behind you!
Shut up! k eep it quiet.
Look around and see if there's a light switch.
- (Nun ) What's all that noise?!
- Quick, Dougal, here.
(Nun ) Calm down, all of you!
Some people are trying to get some sleep!
Arse! Feck! Oh!
Dougal, that's not Father Jack.
- Hello, Father Walton.
- Feck off!
- Will he not do, Ted?
- No. I don't think so, no.
A stage 12.
I never thought I'd see one.
Ah, Ted, can we not keep him?
No. Come on, let's get Father Jack.
- You got the torch, Dougal?
- Yes.
- Arse!
- Feck!
- Drink!
- Girls!
- Drink!
- Feck!
- Drink!
- Feck!
- Arse!
- Girls!
I really shouldn't be here.
- Drink!
- Drink!
- Drink!
- Drink!
Drink! Feck! Arse! Girls!
(Jack) Drink! Drink!
Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink!
- All right, Father, all right.
- Drink! Drink!
Drink!
Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink!
- Drink! Drink!
- Try upstairs, Father.
- Jumping on my picture again?
- You got a problem with that?
- None. Enjoy yourself.
- What was all that noise?
That's Father Jack, the fellow you replaced.
Tell him to get lost. I'm here now.
You might like the pleasure of telling him yourself.
And what happened to his whisky.
He'll fill you in.
I'm supposed to be scared?
Drink!
- Listen to that, Dougal.
- I don't hear anything.
That's what I mean.
The sound of silence.
No, I still don't hear anything.
I'm sorry I didn't disinfect
Jack's chair like you told me.
It's my fault that lad got the hair thing.
Don't worry. I'm sure he's fine up in Jurassic Park.
Best place for him. k eep him out of trouble.
Anyway, how are we getting on in there, Father?
It's a great invention, isn't it?
And no more St Clabbert's.
(Muffled) Drink! Drink! Drink!
Anyway, time for bed.
Come on, Dougal.
(Muffled) Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink!
Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink!
Drink!
'Fathers, please. Calm down.
'Someone step in there, please.
That really is not on.
'You're ruining it.
'Sister, if you could just step in there.'
Break it up, break it up, Fathers.
Break it up.
Put that down.
(Men ) Drink! Arse! Drink!
Feck! Girls! Drink! Arse!
(Nun ) Good night, Fathers!
Aspen prison shuttle docked.

Your living assignment is...
"Y" block, Heavenly Haven.
Red quad. Move on.
Come on.
Welcome home.
That's it!
I think that's Heavenly Haven.
- In your dreams, buddy.
- Yeah, Heavenly...
Starting descent to Sector 12,
Yellow District.

Take caution in this sector.
There is a citizen riot in progress.
Have a nice day.
It's better than prison.

Eat recycled food for a happier, healthier life.
Be kind and peaceful to each other.
Eat recycled food.
Recycled food. It's good for the environment and okay for you.
Hey...
Iook what I got!
Little cupcake.
What have we got here?
Are you a Judge spy, little man?
Me... a spy?
This guy is funny.
No, no, no.
I, I live here.
I mean, I'm gonna live here, if I live.
Maybe I should go to a hotel?
No way, man!
Don't you hear 'em out there?
It's block war, man!
- Block war.
- Yeah.
Just like an Academy simulation right down to the cross fire.
- I'll lead off. You follow.
- This is no sim, rookie!
We'll stand down and wait for backup.
Hershey and Brisco in position outside Heavenly Haven!
We're under fire from the upper floors. Request backup.
Cell "B" in Heavenly Haven, on the corner of Abbott and Costello.
Request backup.
Holy crud!
He's a sitting duck out there.
He knows what he's doing.
I am... the Law!
Drop... your weapons!
These blocks... are under... arrest!
This is your final warning!
That's Judge Dredd, man!
Hey! You wanna be afraid of somebody?
Be afraid of me!
I got it! Why don't I run down there and surrender?
Sort of throw 'em off guard!
Bad idea.
Hey, Dredd!
Come and get us!
- I knew they'd do that.
- Judge Dredd, take cover!
They're firing.20 millimeter caseless flechette rounds at 300 meters.
The effective lethal range is 200 meters.
You're safe. What are you doing down there, Judge Hershey?
Waiting for backup.
It's here.
Let's move it out.
Keep it simple. Single file.
Standard relay.
I'm point. You're last.
- Grenade.
- Grenade.
- Nice shot, sir!
- You two meet me on the 40th.
Hey, you need to get some more ammo!
Be kind and peaceful to each other.
Eat recycled food.
Hey, you guys with us?
Yeah! All right!
Let's rock 'n' roll!
Dredd!
This room has been pacified.
- Next one's mine!
- No! Rookie, hold on!
This room is under arrest!
No!
Die, Judges! Die!
You're under arrest. Throw down your weapons, and prepare to be judged!
Judge this,
Lawgiver man!
- No, don't! They're booby-trapped.
- Intruder.
- Holy drok!
Full auto.
Rapid-fire.
Rapid-fire.
- Armor piercing.
- Armor piercing.
Drop dead, Dredd!
- Double whammy.
- Double whammy.
Mega City municipal code 213:
Willful destruction of property.
That's two years.
Code 310: Illegal possession of assault weapons, five years.
Code 457: Resisting arrest,
20 years!
Thank you, Hershey.
And code 3613:
The first degree murder of a Street Judge.
Let me guess. Life.
Death.
Court's adjourned.
Violence struck again in
Mega City tonight, taking a deadly toll.
Fifty-three hospitalized, five of them children. Nineteen dead.
You got him?
Bring him up. Okay. Now, just turn...
The other way. You got him?
Damn it!
I was supposed to be watching out for him.
Don't blame yourself, Hershey.
He made the mistake, not you.
Wouldn't it feel good to have an emotion once in a while, huh?
Emotions. There oughta be a law against them.
- Eat recycled food.
- Halt!
It's good for the environment, and okay for you.
Please make your selection.
Insert your credit in the slot.
- You have five seconds to surrender!
- Dredd, it's just a servo-droid.
- The servo-droid is your friend.
Please let your friend go by.
- Five. Four.
- Three. Two.
- You are in the way of the servo-droid.
- One!
- Boy, am I glad to see you!
Mega City code 7592:
Willful sabotage of a public droid.
That's six months, citizen.
Let's see your Unicard.
Come on, give me a break,
Judge... Dredd. Dredd?
- God!
- Ferguson, Herman. Hacker.
Illegal tampering with city droids, computers, cash machines, taxi robots...
And you haven't even been out of jail for 24 hours. He's habitual, Hershey.
Automatic five-year sentence.
How do you plead?
- Not guilty?
- I knew you'd say that.
Five years? No! No!
I... I had no choice.
- They were killing each other.
- You could've gone out the window.
- 40 floors? It would've been suicide.
- Maybe... but it's legal.
- Judges?
- Yes, sir?
- What?
Five years. Aspen Penitentiary.
Case closed. Take him away.
Don't close the case.
You're misjudging me! Open the case!
You're not going to be able to sleep tonight.
He might've been telling the truth, you know.
Haven't you ever heard of extenuating circumstances?
I've heard it all, Hershey.
I knew you'd say that.
My fellow Judges, have we forgotten the lessons of history?
My fellow Judges, have we forgotten the lessons of history?
However quickly these block wars can be contained, it's clear that they're becoming an epidemic; an epidemic that should be dealt with... immediately.
The only solution is a tougher criminal code.
Our situation gets worse every day.
73 citizen riots in 16 different sectors in the last two months alone.
Violent crime is rising at 15°/o every quarter.
If we don't increase our resources, they will be inadequate in less than three years.
Three years?
Our resources are inadequate now!
My fellow Council members, as a city we continue to grow, and growth is painful.
Sixty-five million people living in an area designed for no more than 20!
It's not enough that they rely on us... for food, clothes, water, clean air...
Chief Justice, the city is in chaos!
For social order, we need tighter reins.
Incarceration hasn't worked as a deterrent.
I say we expand execution to include lesser crimes!
My fellow Judges,
I was barely in my teens when I put on this badge.
When the time comes for me to take it off, please let me do so knowing that it still stands for freedom... and not for repression.
- 53 hospitalized.
Nineteen dead, four of them killed by a gang of squatters... who were themselves killed in summary executions by Judge Dredd.
As my special undercover report continues,
I will take you behind the scenes at the Halls of Justice... for a disturbing probe into these recent riots and block wars.
Coincidence... or deliberate?
Dredd!
Dredd!
Some people think working these mean streets has a dehumanizing effect on...
- Joseph.
- Chief Justice Fargo.
You may stand at ease,
Joseph.
So, tell me. Seven summary executions.
Were they necessary?
Unavoidable, sir.
Unavoidable.
Life doesn't mean much to some people anymore.
- You'd see that if you weren't always...
- If I weren't what?
Always at the Academy, sir.
Oh! Don't you mean, at the Academy wiping cadets' asses?
That's what they say in the squad room, isn't it?
It's irrelevant.
You set the standard, sir.
Now you do... at least to many young cadets.
You're a legend.
Sir.
You remember your days as a cadet, Joseph?
I remember what you taught me, sir.
You were my finest student.
So, I've drawn a new assignment for you.
Starting tomorrow, you're going to spend two days a week at the Academy.
I'd be honored, sir.
Narmed combat or marksmanship?
Ethics.
Wait here.
Remain still. Identify yourself.
Miller. Warden.
Voice sample recognized.
Thank you, Warden. System disarmed.
Why are you here?
Did you come for another chat?
Just a short one, I'm afraid.
Duty calls.
Ah, duty!
Feeding these parasites here at the public's expense?
Yeah.
You especially!
I don't cost anything.
I'm a ghost.
And we're both prisoners here.
You're behind your desk... and I'm behind this.
What a clever reward from Fargo, huh?
I mean, considering the services.
When you started killing innocent people, Rico, you went beyond service.
The innocent exist only until they inevitably become perpetrators... like you.
Guilt and innocence... is a matter of timing.
Your...
Our mysterious benefactor... has sent you a package.
Deactivate shield.
Autoguns only.
Autoguns reactivated, Warden Miller.
Hmm.
- What is that?
- It's an ancient puzzle... that contains the meaning of life.
So, tell me, Rico, what is the meaning of life?
It ends.
Stop! Computer!
Activate alarm!
Voice not recognized.
Guns are training.
Remain still.
Security, override and unlock!
Come on!
Kevlar 9 helmet and body armor.
Yours... when you graduate.
Lawgiver Two.
25-round side arm with mission-variable voice-programmed ammunition.
- Signal flare.
- Flare.
Yours... if you graduate.
Mark 4 Lawmaster, improved model, with dual on-board laser cannons, vertical take-off and landing flight capability.
Range: 500 kilometers.
- Men.
- Yes, sir.
Active. Malfunction. Malfunction.
Malfunction.
Hmm?
Yours if you can ever get it to work.
All of these things you see here are toys.
At the end of the day when you're all alone in the dark, the only thing that counts... is this: The Law.
And you will be alone when you swear to uphold these ideals.
For most of us, there's only death in the streets.
For the few of us that survive to old age, the proud loneliness of the Long Walk.
A walk that every Judge must take... outside these city walls... into the unknown of the Cursed Earth.
And there spend your last remaining days... taking law to the lawless.
This is what it means to be a Judge.
This is the commitment
I expect.
Class dismissed.
Attention all personnel.
Due to the recent disturbance in Heavenly Haven, there will be increased patrols in Sector 4.
Please check with your commanders to see if you are affected... by these scheduled changes.
I can hear you thinking.
I caught your lecture today.
Is that really what you think the cadets need to hear?
- What I told them is the truth.
- Your truth maybe.
You made it sound like our lives are practically over.
Don't you think... parts are, Hershey?
I have a personal life.
I have friends.
You're one of the smartest of the new breed, but you've only been on the street a year.
You haven't gotten used to the isolation yet.
No. No,
I don't think that's right.
No one is supposed to be alone all the time.
I mean, is that really what it's been like for you?
Don't you ever... haven't you ever had a friend?
Yes. Once.
What happened?
Dredd, wait.
I want to know.
What happened?
I judged him.
Aspen shuttle has completed off-loading.
- Cargo and morgue shipments from Aspen.
- Okay.
Let's get outta here.
Get your nose filters!
Get your nose filters!
Please select your fantasy now and enjoy.
...who were themselves killed... in summary executions by Judge Dredd.
As my special undercover report continues,
I will take you behind the scenes at the Halls of Justice.
We're closed for the night.
You're holding a package for me.
The code name is Lazarus.
I'll just be a second.
You got a nice place.
Yeah.
A lot of this is antiques.
I thought they destroyed all these
A.B.C. Warriors during the last war.
Well, you can still collect 'em... as long as they're nonfunctioning... like my wife.
- These must be 50 or 60 years old now.
Anyway... there you go.
- Hey, wait a second! Don't touch it.
- Why is that?
It's a Lawgiver. That's programmed to only recognize a Judge's hand.
You touch that, it'll take your arm off.
Gee... how do you like that?
I must be a Judge.
Happy birthday.
Status?
Bodyguard.
- Commander?
- Rico.
- Mission?
- Mission? We're going to war.
War.
I followed up some grumblings confirming a suspicion of mine.
The cancer of oppression goes far deeper than the Street Judges.
- You're going to say that over the air?
- It's the truth!
- Oh, Vardas, you're insane.
- I'm a reporter.
They're never going to let this get onto the air.
Something like this could bring down the Council.
Maybe it should. The whole system is the problem, not just judge...
Dredd. No!
Judge Hershey, corner of burns and allen. Level "d."
Possible D... l.
May need assistance.
Here we go!
- Step out of the car, please.
- What the hell's the problem now?
Get out of the car!
Nicard, please.
Did you hear me?
Nicard!
Mr. Souza. You have a suspended license.
- You've got three counts of driving under the influence.
- Hey, you better listen.
I suggest you walk away and bother somebody else.
When I said I have powerful friends,
I mean powerful!
- Are we having a problem, Hershey?
- Not at all. Nothing I can't handle.
Suspended license.
Three D... l.'s.
This is getting boring.
Okay, so what's the tab? C'mon.
How much is this going to cost me?
You name your price.
Hershey, call Control for an H-wagon.
What? I don't believe it.
You're going to tow me?
Towing is for a first offense. This is your fourth violation, bar breath.
- You're a menace. How do you plead?
- Not guilty.
I knew you'd say that.
- Wait a second. What are you doing?
- Grenade.
- Grenade.
- No!
Happy motoring.
- Subtle.
- Mm-hmm.
Judge Joseph Dredd.
Dredd, you're under arrest.
What's the charge?
Murder.
Attention. Chief Justice Fargo now entering maximum security area.
- Joseph.
- Sir.
- Is it true?
- I'm innocent.
The Council is said to have irrefutable proof.
Do you believe that?
There is to be a full tribunal.
- A conviction means death.
- Do you believe that, sir?
I just needed to look into your eyes for myself.
I'm sorry I asked.
I would never do anything to disgrace you with the Council, sir.
I'll use every resource to find out, Joseph.
Have you selected someone to defend you?
- Judge Hershey.
- Hershey? Why a Street Judge?
At the Academy, she was at the top of her class in interpretational law.
And I trust her.
The facts will come out at the tribunal.
I'll personally make sure of that.
Sir?
I'm sorry about this.
- Dredd! No!
Play back.
- Dredd! No!
- Dredd! No!
Play back.
Stop video. The video you have just seen... is prima facie evidence that the defendant is guilty as charged.
Mark it people's exhibit "a."
Objection, Your Honor.
This video is inadmissible as evidence.
- If I may be given a moment to explain?
- Please do.
I have an affidavit from Nathan Olmeyer, currently a junior at the Academy.
Cadet Olmeyer has been acknowledged... by every one of his instructors to be an expert in digital and video graphics.
His affidavit states this surveillance video is of such low definition, no positive identification can be made of the killer.
Your Honors, we know that the uniform of a Judge can be counterfeit... and that the badge can be duplicated, and since neither the video nor the audio in this presentation... can identify the accused in any way,
I repeat my objection to this video being allowed as evidence in this case, and I ask for a ruling.
Objection sustained.
The video is inadmissible.
Yes!
Shh.
Admit it, Dredd.
- What?
- You're impressed.
- Very.
- You owe me.
- Hmm.
- Very well.
I'm therefore forced to move... to technical information of a critical nature.
I will need the court's permission... to access top-secret documentation... with the help of
Central Computer Bank.
You may proceed.
Central, are you on-line?
On-line, Judge McGruder.
I wish you to access weapons schematic.
Describe the working of the standard
Judge's side arm, the Lawgiver Two.
Model Two is coded to the personal D.N. A... of the Judge using the weapon... via the skin's contact with the grip, a fail-safe security...
- Did you know about this?
- No!
The D.N.A. Is obtained from my medical files, and upgraded automatically every time the weapon is reloaded.
Each time a round is chambered and fired... the projectile is tagged with the relevant D.N.A.
Chief Justice, the defense was not made aware of any of this information.
Judge Hershey, the prosecution must be given time to finish.
Central, were the bullets recovered from the bodies of Vardas and Lily Hammond... so D.N.A. Coded?
Yes, Judge McGruder.
It could not be otherwise.
And what was the result of the computer check... of the D.N.A. Coding on those bullets?
The D.N.A. Is a perfect match for Judge Joseph Dredd.
It's a lie!
The evidence has been falsified.
It's impossible!
I never broke the Law! I am the Law!
- We have no case.
- You gotta believe me!
You have to believe me.
Say it.
Your Honor... the prosecution rests.
The Tribunal needs to confer!
What have I done?
How could I have been so wrong?
Dredd!
Both of them homicidal.
Only this time it will be impossible to cover up.
Chief Justice, we carefully buried the Janus project nine years ago... along with Rico and all his victims.
No one will ever learn of your involvement.
The media knows how close I am to Dredd.
They'll dig until the whole truth comes out.
It's the perfect excuse to ruin what government we have left.
Your motives were pure.
You thought Dredd was different.
That's why you spared him.
A mistake which may bring down the judicial system.
There is a way out,
Chief Justice.
If you will forgive me.
The Long Walk.
That's a death sentence,
Judge Griffin. Mine.
Your retirement grants you the power to save Dredd's life!
This gesture... may also allow Janus to remain a secret.
In the charge of premeditated murder, this tribunal finds
Joseph Dredd... guilty as charged.
Joseph Dredd, you're aware the law allows only one punishment for your crime.
Death.
However, it has long been our custom... to carry out the last order of a retiring Senior Judge.
And so...
I step down.
No!
As I leave... to take my Long Walk into the Cursed Earth,
I ask that this court honor my last order.
Be lenient with Judge Dredd... in gratitude for his years of service.
We will so honor this one,
Judge Fargo.
Dredd, step forward.
The sentence shall be life imprisonment... at Aspen Penal Colony, to be carried out immediately... as it is written!
Justice Griffin, this trial has been a farce! I demand an appeal!
You will accept the court's decision,
Judge Hershey!
Dredd, I'm so sorry.
I let you down.
You did your best, Hershey.
Thank you.
Let the betrayer of the Law... be taken from our courts.
Let his armor be taken from him, and all his garb of justice.
Let him be stricken from our hearts and our memory... forever.
Let his name be recorded in every place of honor.
Let him take the Law he served so well... to those who have it not.
Let him be written... in our hearts and our memories... forever.
Attention all judges.
You are reminded...
Judge Hershey.
It's gotta be here some...
What's this?
Baby Dredd?
I can't believe you were ever a baby.
Who's this?
Chief Justice Griffin.
It's got a nice ring to it.
We were supposed to meet someplace safe!
What's not safe?
Your reporter's dead, right?
Fargo's on his Walk.
Dredd's in Aspen.
So, what's not safe?
It's unfortunate.
Hammond had to be silenced.
He found out about Janus.
- But I could've used Dredd.
- Forget Dredd!
There is no Dredd!
Let me tell you what Dredd worships.
He worships the Law!
He'd have blown you away the minute he found out how much you're pissin' on it.
Yeah. Let him see what it's like to freeze his ass off in Aspen.
Let him see what it's like to be me!
There's a lot of work to be done.
Janus.
Well, where is it?
- You'll see it!
- When?
Soon enough!
In the meantime,
I want chaos, Rico.
That block war was just the beginning.
Now I want fear racing through every street!
And the Council will have to turn to me.
And to Janus!
You want fear?
I'm fear.
You want chaos?
I'm the chaos.
You want a new beginning? Here!
I am the new beginning!
This is Aspen Shuttle CF-188.
Due to storm cloud activity over the desert, we will be flying at 60 feet.
Flight time approximately four hours.
Dredd? Don't hit me. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. Don't hurt me.
What are you doing here?
I was convicted of a crime.
Wrongly convicted.
Really?
That's kinda weird.
What are the odds?
Two wrongly-convicted guys sittin' right next to each other.
You received the sentence the Law required.
Five years... just for saving my own ass?
That was a mistake!
The Law doesn't make mistakes.
Really? Then how do you explain what happened to you?
You can't... can you?
Great!
Mr. "I am the law" can't.
So, maybe, this is some kind of typo.
Maybe it's a glitch.
Or maybe it's poetic justice!
Shuttle comin'! Shuttle!
Shuttle!
Shuttle comin', Pa!
Look!
Praise the Lord for bringing us this generous bounty.
My sons... gather the harvest.
So maybe you're here as some sort of field trip.
Yeah!
Maybe this is some sort of... surprise party.
Whoo! Gonna catch me some city boy!
It's payback time, Dredd!
Dredd, what's happening?
By a blast of God they perish.
And by a breath of His nostrils are they consumed.
Hallelujah!
Central, I need you to access graphics data base.
I want you to run an I.D. On this man.
Scanning for identity. Nknown male, approximately 200 centimeters tall, skin tone three.
Ten, nine, eight...
Central? Hello?
This terminal has been terminated from the main system.
Your authority has been removed,
Judge Hershey.
This is Group Leader.
We've located the shuttle.
This is Capture Team.
There's no sign of Dredd.
He appears to have survived the crash.
You are in error, Capture
Team. No one survived the shuttle wreck.
Understand?
Just find Dredd!
The pilot, sir.
He's alive.
No one survived the shuttle wreck!
Do I make myself clear?
Yes, sir.
Am I dead?
Am I dead?
I'm dead!
- Awake!
Good!
We're running out of sinners.
Oh, my God!
- Dredd, do something!
- Dredd?
You talk too much.
Can it be?
The great man of the Law himself.
O Lord, you have blessed us indeed!
Judge "rat" Dredd.
You creeps are under arrest.
Is that so?
Let me crush him, Pa.
- Excuse me. We're not together.
Allow me to introduce you to my family.
- There's Link, my oldest.
- Bite me!
Hi!
My youngest, Junior.
- Howdy.
- Hi!
And this here is Mean.
We had to make some alterations when he was a child.
The Cursed Earth's a tough place on young folks.
I now have him set on one.
I don't suggest you make him angry.
The legendary Angel family.
Cursed Earth pirates, murderers, scavengers.
- And, of course, scumbags.
- Oh, that'll win 'em over!
Did I leave something out,
Pa?
- Let me kill 'im, Pa. I want his ears.
- I want his teeth.
Does that come with a fork, handsome?
Hallelujah, brother!
Wait a minute.
Can it be?
Can it be that from the city of the fallen...
- we have one of the faithful?
- Amen, brother!
- Praise the Lord! I'm a believer!
- Fergie, don't do it.
It sounds like we have a believer in the gallery.
- Yes!
- Cut him down!
- Go tell it on the mountain!
- Fergie.
You're making a big mistake.
Well, Dredd, maybe the Law doesn't make mistakes, but I'm free and you're toast.
Actually, you're toast.
I forgot to mention it.
Your new friends, they're cannibals.
- Fresh meat.
- Prepare the supplicant for sacrifice.
No, wait.
You can't eat me!
I've got eczema. I've got warts.
I've had gonorrhea.
Eat Dredd.
He works out.
Yum, yum.
It's been fun, Lawman.
Finish Dredd.
My pleasure, Pa.
Come on.
Come on!
Come on, Junior!
- Guilty!
- Shut up!
- Dredd, look out!
There's Dredd!
- Go!
Well, we did it.
We got 'em all.
- Hmm.
- Pussies! Is that all you got?
They are dead, right?
Have you been crying?
I'm not crying.
I got something in my eye.
You ever have allergies?
Dredd, look out!
- Chief Justice!
- Joseph, together again.
Together again, sir.
- No!
- God, not again!
You got three strikes,
Lawman!
Strike one.
Strike two!
Strike three.
You're out, Lawman!
You killed Link!
You killed Junior!
You killed my brothers!
You even killed my pa.
Mega City municipal code 4722:
Illegal use of city electricity.
- How do you plead?
I knew you'd say that!
Graphics analysis now.
Olmeyer, you stupid futz!
I can't...
You analyzed the wrong viewie, all right. The wrong one. This one!
I don't believe it.
You just wasted three hours.
If this is the wrong picture,
Why is it fake?
What?
Look. It's full of anomalies.
Really clever ones too.
Somebody must've used a C.G.I. Terminal and a scan quad to make this.
This is state-of-the-art... twenty years ago.
Are you saying this isn't real?
Yeah. Look, I'll drop out all the artificial pixels.
Dad. Mom.
Foreground.
Background.
All fake.
The only thing that's real is the baby.
Oh. The blind lady.
Who is she?
Justice... before your time.
We should never have taken justice out of her hands.
- You brought order to chaos, sir.
- That we did.
Solved many problems, and created many more!
- Being a Judge, Joseph, perhaps too much power in one person's hands.
We once tried to compensate:
Create the perfect Judge.
We called it Janus.
Four decades ago,
D.N.A. Samples were taken from the original Council.
One was chosen.
Mine.
We altered it to enhance the best qualities... and screen out the worst:
Weaknesses, frailties.
We created you.
You didn't create me, sir.
- I have a family.
- No.
At the Academy, you told me they were killed when I was very young.
A lie.
I have a picture of them.
A fake.
We lied... to both of you.
Both?
There was another infant created in that experiment, but something went wrong.
Genetically mutated to the perfect criminal.
I have a brother?
You were best friends at the Academy.
Star pupils.
And then he turned.
And for his crimes, you judged him.
Rico?
Rico.
You let me judge my own brother?
You never told me, sir.
I couldn't!
You were like a son to me!
A son.
My whole life is a lie.
Rico had to be executed to protect you, to protect the city.
Rico.
Rico. He's alive!
No.
I signed the order myself.
- I saw the report.
- I didn't kill Hammond.
It was him. It was his D.N.A.
That convicted me.
Griffin. Hmph.
It was Griffin.
Griffin, yes.
We've both been deceived, Joseph.
I'm so sorry.
Rico's killed me and destroyed you!
Fi... find him, joseph.
Don't die.
What do we do?
What do we do?
Find Rico.
Welcome to Janus.
Rico, I think you know
Dr. Hayden.
I remember you. Testified before the Council that I was insane, right?
- And therefore innocent.
- I was trying to save your life.
What you did was insult me,
'cause I knew exactly what I was doing.
Then and now.
Miss Hayden has been a loyal supporter of this project for a long time.
She's kept it alive for me. I'm sure you'll find her expertise invaluable.
Excuse me! All this is useless if you can't get into Central's Janus files,
'cause the Council has 'em locked.
Leave that to me. Meanwhile you have work to do... on the streets.
- Ilsa will help you.
- I don't need no help! Thanks.
I thought you said he was created here by the finest scientists of Mega City.
A bold experiment.
He's a petulant child.
Let's not bicker.
We're here to achieve the same thing.
An ordered society.
You'll have your New Order.
Attention, all Judges.
Reporting unrest, code D-924.
Downtown, Sector 12.
Backup requested.
Nineteen different explosions in 11 different sectors.
Extra caution to be taken on approach to 914...
Search all areas bordering the Elite Building.
The anonymous caller did not specify capacity. Proceed with caution.
My boy!
Dredd, there's no way in!
Hello?
Are you even listening to me?
We can't just knock on the wall and say, "hello, cursed earth pizza."
There is a way in.
Six years ago, two refugees figured it out.
It's a vent to the city's incinerator.
There's a burst twice a minute.
That means somebody could run through that tube... and have 30 seconds before it flames again.
And these, these refugees, they made it through, right?
Actually, they were roasted.
But the theory's sound.
Shall we?
Maybe we should consider other theories. Dredd!
Dispatch, I'm in Green Quad 411.
Need a pickup.
Copy, Hershey.
I have Central on-line for you.
Patch it to my Lawmaster.
Warning.
Alien device on board.
Oh, my God!
Latest casualty report:
96 Judges have been assassinated!
Whoever's doing this seems to know all our procedures, our security measures, even our scrambled frequencies.
With no Judges on the street, riots are breaking out all over Mega City.
We can't replace those Judges.
Even if we put the cadets on the street, we won't be at full strength for years!
There is a solution.
Project Janus.
This Council tried to play God once before.
If this wholesale slaughter of Judges continues, there won't be a Council.
- Janus could...
- Janus could what?
A new batch of test-tube babies won't solve this crisis.
We don't need reliable Judges
20 years from now, we need them today!
Accelerated growth incubators are more developed now.
We could create adult subjects.
All I'm asking is that we unlock the Janus files.
That way we at least have an option!
If the Council decides not to go forward,
I'll accept that decision... and resign.
- All right, you ready, kid?
- No!
- Now what's wrong?
- What's wrong? Are you kidding?
Did wearing that helmet all those years compress your brain?
- You're gonna get me killed.
- There's a maniac loose in this city!
What a coincidence!
- There's one out here too!
- Oh.
Great time I'm having. The shuttle crash, the Cursed Earth, cannibals.
And now a fireball up my ass!
- This is all your fault!
- My fault?
- Yes!
- You care to explain that, citizen?
If you hadn't arrested me,
I wouldn't be here in the first place.
Hey, Dredd, what if you just kill me now?
That's it!
I'm through schlepping.
I'm gonna stay here until
I'm caught or 'til you apologize!
- The Law can't apologize!
- You're not the Law anymore.
Now apologize.
I think I deserve that.
I've never apologized.
Now run!
Thirty, twenty-nine, twenty-eight,
- twenty-seven, twenty-six,
- Run!
Twenty-five, twenty-four, twenty-three, twenty-two, twenty-one, nineteen...
Dredd? Dredd!
Dredd!
I don't wanna die!
Jump!
I'm alive!
I'm alive!
Oh... so are you.
Esposito, Carlos.
Council Judge.
Authorize access to file, code name Janus.
Acknowledged.
McGruder, Evelyn. Authorize access to file, code name Janus.
Acknowledged.
Silver, Gerald.
Authorize access to file, code name Janus.
Removing security blocks now.
Awaiting password command from presiding Chief Justice.
Password, origin.
Janus file opened.
Attention.
Ntil emergency repairs are completed, ward "c" locker room is off limits.
Psst.
I'm lost.
Is this the bathroom?
Hey!
Now you have to admit,
I helped out on that one.
I mean, that was all me, baby!
Hey, hey, wh... why are you taking off his clothes?
We don't have time for this.
Central, using current technology, how long would it take for Janus to produce a fully-grown adult subject?
Given the current state of genetic engineering, an adult subject could be incubated in approximately eight hours.
- We could replace our losses in a day.
- This is madness.
Ah, Dredd?
- Silence.
- Dredd!
Shh. I'm busy.
Dredd?
It's inhuman.
It's not for this Council to play God!
No, Griffin.
Please restore the security blocks.
It seems none of you have the force of will that these times require.
Central, leave Janus unlocked.
Griffin, this is treason.
You have just sealed your fate.
No!
You have just sealed yours!
Rico!
Now who says politics is boring?
- Hey, Dredd! I thought it was you.
That's right!
Cover your ears!
- Rico.
- Joseph.
Get out of here... now!
No!
- You're under arrest, Griffin.
- Really?
Stop him! He just killed the entire Council!
- Move it out!
- Dredd, tell them I'm innocent.
Come on, Fergie!
Run!
You're a lot of fun to be with, Dredd.
You know that?
- What are you gonna do?
- Hope it works.
What is wrong with this piece of shit?
That's a solid brick wall!
You're going to kill us!
Dredd!
You gotta make it work!
Make it work!
Malfunction.
Malfunction. On-line.
Dredd, you may want to wash this seat after we get off the bike.
- Hmm.
- Sorry.
Dredd, move it!
- Fergie, cover the rear.
- I've never fired a gun in my life!
- What kind of a criminal are you?
- A nice criminal.
- Nothing's happening!
- You gotta cock it first, moron.
You didn't say anything about cocking.
Nice!
Stop! Please, God!
You can drop me off here.
- Dredd, that's a dead end.
- I know.
Oh, God!
Fergie, take over!
Where are you going?
Dredd!
- This is where you get off, creep!
- Need a lift, kid?
I'm never riding with you again, Dredd!
She's definitely not gonna get her cleaning deposit back, that's for sure.
It doesn't pay to be one of your friends, Dredd. Sorry!
Hands against the wall.
You know the drill.
- Who are you?
- Dredd said that...
Shut up!
- What happened?
- Why don't you tell me, Dredd, huh?
We're dyin' out there!
108 Judges in 48 hours!
What the hell is going on?
You think I'm part of this?
I don't know who or what you are anymore.
I would never do anything to hurt you, Hersh.
You know that.
All right.
You tell me about him, huh?
You make me believe in you like I did when I defended you.
His name is Rico... and he's my brother.
The D.N.A. Sample has been taken out of frozen stasis.
- Ready for cloning process.
- We got a slight change of plans here.
I want to take the existing
D.N.A. Sample right now and trash it.
Activate this
D.N.A. Sampling console.
What are you doing?
Central, take... this D.N.A. Sample now.
This wasn't part of our plan!
Judge Griffin would never have authorized this!
Processing.
You know, Griffin got to be my keeper by puttin' me behind bars.
What's your excuse?
You said I had no feelings and no emotions.
Now you know why.
Dredd... look at me.
The Janus project didn't do that to you.
You did that to yourself.
Sorry, guys, I'm getting nowhere with your terminal.
But I fixed the microwave.
You want some popcorn?
Is this a bad time?
Look, I tried dialing everything I could think of to find this Janus thing.
It just isn't in the program.
Nowhere. Nothing.
They'd never take a chance and put it on the computer network... but they need power and they're gonna steal it from somewhere.
Check every sector for recent blackouts and sudden power surges.
- Great. Let's stay here longer!
- Wait a second.
Just before they blew up my Lawmaster in Sector Four, there was a power surge, a really big one, three blocks wide.
The last time I felt something like that, they shut down the whole power grid in that area, remember?
When they moved the Statue of Liberty, they put it right down on top of it.
- Right.
- Could we go now?
Dredd... that's twice you owe me.
Rico! Dredd got away from the hunters.
Well, he's about to be seriously outnumbered.
- Right, Central?
- Affirmative, Judge Rico.
The new D.N.A. Sample has been multiplexed, and the gametes are already dividing.
New sample?
You left that D.N.A.
In there for over 30 years!
Sooner or later, somebody's gonna clean out the fridge.
That sample was created from the finest specimens on the Council of Judges!
What did you replace it with?
No. My God.
You should congratulate me right now,
'cause I'm about to be a daddy.
You're being very, very rude.
You don't know what you're doing!
The next batch of Janus Judges are not going to be the puppets that you want!
They're gonna be my brothers and sisters! And mine to control!
I can't let you do this.
You're both insane! I have to stop...
Central... help me!
I'm sorry, Chief Justice, the A.B.C. Robot... is not tied into my main processor.
That's right, Griff. You gotta get with this high-tech stuff.
- Robot, rip his arms and legs off.
- No!
And you save his head for last.
I don't want him to miss anything!
- Anything!
- No!
- Fergie, you stay here.
- By myself?
You'll need me to shut down the Janus system. We're a team.
Granted, you do most of the work, but we're still a team.
- I'll handle it, kid.
- I bring you luck.
- Luck?
- You are still alive, Dredd.
Hmm.
- I'm getting a signal.
It's close.
It's moving closer!
Jesus Christ!
Get back!
No!
Dredd!
Drop the gun.
Robot, on the count of three, break her neck.
One, two...
No!
- Hershey?
- I'm still here.
- How romantic. Step inside.
He looks a lot like you.
He looks a lot like you.
He is a lot like me.
I am nothing like you.
The only difference between us, Joseph, is you destroyed your life... to embrace the Law.
And I destroyed the Law... to embrace life.
And speaking of life, send in the clones.
Behold!
This is where you were born.
Feel that magic?
But you must've known all along... you were different.
Fergie... are you still alive?
Technically... yes.
Your brothers and your sisters.
Be born in two hours.
One big, endless supply of perfection.
You know, we have a choice.
We can stand here right now... and create a whole race of brainwashed morons, and call them Judges.
Or we can create some freethinking people.
We'll call them human.
Human.
You could never control yourself.
What makes you think you can control... these things?
'Cause you're in control.
You be head of the Council.
You choose, and you choose quickly too.
I should've put you down myself... personally!
You know,
I never understood that.
Why did you judge me?
Why did you judge me?
- You killed innocent people.
- The means to an end.
- You started a massacre.
- I caused a revolution.
- You betrayed the Law!
- Law!
I betrayed this!
Your Council's experiment, which failed in you!
I was your brother, your blood, your friend.
Who betrayed who?
When are you gonna stop being a goddamn slave and grow up?
That's your birthright, that's your family.
I'm your family.
I'm the only family you ever had!
Now choose!
The best thing you can do is kill me.
Why?
Because it's your only chance... brother.
Fido!
Rip this bitch's arms and legs off.
- Save her pretty head for my brother.
- Don't do it!
Halt!
Rip his head off instead.
Give it to her.
What's the matter with you?
Rico!
- Boy, is he pissed!
- Fergie!
Dredd!
- Get him, Dredd!
- Hang on, Fergie.
Hack you, asshole.
Rico!
Central, hatch that first set of clones.
The cloning process is not finished, Judge Rico.
The clones will be only 60°/o complete.
I need reinforcements.
Hatch the goddamn clones now!
Don't fight much, do you?
Bitch!
It's Judge Bitch!
I'm the only one who never lied to you.
I'll be the judge of that.
Now, Joseph Dredd,
I hereby judge you.
To the charge of betraying your flesh... guilty.
To the charge of being human, when we could have been Gods... guilty.
The sentence is death.
Don't miss.
Lethal round is exhausted.
Signal flare!
Court is adjourned.
Dredd.
Give me your hand.
That's three times now, Dredd.
Stay in back, Hershey.
- Am I under arrest?
- That won't be necessary.
Central broadcast the Janus plan after Griffin's death.
They all know the truth.
Judge Dredd, we have to reconstitute the Council.
We'd like you to consider the first position of Chief Justice.
I'm a Street Judge.
And I'm very late for work.
Thank you, Olmeyer.
I am dying.
I'm too young... excuse me.
Oh, that's great!
He gets all the credit.
Dredd?
I taught him everything he knows.
Dredd, that's it?
No good-bye?
Good-bye, Hershey.
To tell you the truth,
I'm probably a much better kisser.
Ow! Okay, come on, let's go, will ya?
Can we swing by a cash machine?
Feels good to be human, don't you think?
I knew you'd say that.
Ah! You're here.
Hello. Welcome.
I'm Dr. Clayton Forrester, and soon you will all bow down before me.
What you're about to see is an experiment, and, by observing, you have become part of that experiment.
For I have shot a man into space and I'm driving him crazy by forcing him to watch the worst movies ever made.
Oh, sure, we all have thought about it, but I had the guts to do it!
This is my test subject:
Mike Nelson.
A disgustingly mild-mannered dope who has managed to survive every film I subjected him to.
But perhaps this movie will drive him to the breaking point and crush his soul, and then I'll unleash it on an unwitting public, and then I will rule the world!
Yes!
I'm a naughty boy!
Naughty, naughty, naughty, naugh... ty.
Well, you will join Mike in watching the Universal classic
This Island Earth
Now, prepare yourselves for my maddest madness yet!
Now poopie.
Mystery Science Theater 3000
The Movie
Morning, Mike!
Morning, Gypsy!
Whaddaya got for me?
Oxygen-nitrogen mix is within required standards, we're currently in low orbit over Southern Madagascar, and that wonderful smell is a lamb roast I have in the oven.
- And sweet yams?
- Affirmative!
Oh, and I compiled today's wire service reports.
Here's a hard copy.
The Cubs lost again.
Oh! Why, hello Mike!
Everything workin' fine on the ol' Satellite of Love today, hmm?
No dangerous problems or horrible mishaps in sight?
No, Tom, everything appears nominal.
Ah, nominal, good, good.
So I guess that means you're not worried about what that rythmic pounding might be.
- Yeah, what is that?
- Yeah, what is that, hmm?
I'm a highly sophisticated robot,
Mike, and I'm telling you:
This is not something you should be hearing!
Something's causing this, Mike!
Hm, now let's think.
I'm here, you're here,
Gypsy's here...
- Ok, Tom, where's Crow?
- Where's Crow?
Uh, I'm not supposed to say anything, but I did see that litle moron headed towards the basement with a pickaxe in his hand.
Gypsy!
Go to condition yellow!
- We gotta stop him!
- Roger!
It's a loooong way to Tipperary, to the sweetest girl I know!
Goodbye to Noah Berry!
Hello Harold Lloooooyd!
- Crow?
- Huh?
Crow, listen, you've gotta stop!
Oh! Hi Mike!
I've found the perfect spot!
Once I break through this wall, we'll tunnel our way right back to Earth!
Crow, you big dope!
You can't tunnel through space!
Come, come, boys, we must confound Jerry at every turn!
Crow, no!
You'll breach the hull!
HULL
BREACH
I didn't expect this!
Gaining maximum R.P.M.
Adjust pitch and yaw thrusters!
Stabilize!
There! That should do it.
Wow, this is confusing!
Mike!
You wanna hand me me my calculations?
Thank you.
Well, look at that.
"Breach hull; all die."
Even had it underlined.
I don't wanna die!
Oh! Mommy! Mommy!
I love you, Mike!
- Atta boy, Servo!
- I won't do that again!
Hey! I'm experiencing a sensation altogether new to me!
And frankly, I love it!
Now, Crow, I told you:
No more escape attempts.
Believe me, Mike,
I calculated the odds of this succeeding versus against the odds
I was doing something incredibly stupid and I went ahead anyway.
There you go.
Aw, darn!
It's time!
Dr. F. is calling for you.
Ah, Mike.
Robots.
I'm feeling particularly evil because today's experiment is a stinky cinematic suppository called
This Island Earth
You may just all bow down before me after this stinkburger.
Say, come to think about it,
I don't believe you've bowed down before me recently.
Uh, sure we have, last week.
No, no, no! I think that was more of a curtsey than a bow.
So why don't we all just bow down... now.
I don't see a reason to make us...
Bowing, sir!
...I bow before you, sir...
Okay, Dr. Forrester.
Jees!
What a dickweed!
Well, now that we've had our little fun, prepare yourself for... uh...
But, before I start the experiment... uh...
Did you, you know, go?
Yes.
Because I don't wanna have to stop the movie for...
- You know.
- You won't.
Then, prepare yourselves for...
This Island Earth
We've got Movie Sign!
Ah, it's the nicest weather
Earth has ever had!
Notice how big Japan is?
Space, the final frontier.
These are the voyages of
Babylon 5.
Doesn't the fact that it's universal make it international?
This island earth can be yours if the price is right!
Hey, who sneezed on the credits?
Okay, let's see here.
Shatner? Shatner?
Nope! Doesn't look like he's in this one, we're safe!
I feel so insignificant.
Of course,
I always feel insignificant!
The light from this credits originated well over 7.000 years ago.
Boy, the universe is really cruising.
Look, there's Taurus, the bull!
And right underneath him the constellation Feces.
Oh, look!
Orion is bankrupt.
So, these are images from the Hubble?
When in California, be sure to visit beautiful... oh...
It's a long par 5 leading to the nation's capital.
Who'd build so far back on the lot?
Washingtonland, the new Disney theme park!
One more. Just one more, please, Dr. Meacham.
Hold it, please.
A little closer to the wing, sir.
Watch your lips!
A little more profile,
Dr. Meacham.
He wants to get that faraway, visionary look.
Cal, we know how tired you must be.
- We'll make it as short as possible.
- Fire away, gentlemen,
I warn you, I am beginning to feel faraway and visionary.
How about your conference with the committee on atomic power?
Not my conference. Twenty engineers and scientists were there.
Twenty? Hardly a routine meeting, would you say?
Yeah, and look, Cal: we won't buy the committee's getting you VIPs together for a cocktail party.
All right, boys,
I'll tell you this much.
You boys like to call this
"the push-button age."
It isn't. Not yet.
Not until we can team up atomic energy with electronics.
Then we'll have the horses as well as the cart.
How long has the army been handing out jets, doctor?
Yeah!
One of the boys at Lockheed handed me this one.
I hope you taxpayers don't mind.
We do!
Cal, when do we get to this "push-button age"?
When fellows like me stop talking about it and get back to our labs.
See you gentlemen later.
- Goodbye!
- So long!
Kiss me goodbye?
Cal, are you working on anything along the lines you mentioned?
- Roughly.
- Well, remember me, will you?
I'm the wormy guy.
I'm concentrating on the reconversion of certain common elements into nuclear energy sources.
- Huh? How's that again?
- What counts is how I make it work.
I see.
Good flight, Cal.
- Thank you.
- So long.
- Dickweed.
- Jack-off.
Other people need to use this ladder, you know?
My wife has the seat so close, how can she drive like this?
Those decals are really hard to put on without ripping.
John Sununu goes for a haircut.
Fortunately, he has his theme music on eight-track.
Hey! You can see the Cubs losing!
Geez, there's soccer teams lying all over the place!
Oh, for crying out... when are they gonna fill that in?
Hey, his legs are sticking out!
Ricola!
I'm so lost!
Keanu Reeves in
My Own Private Airfield.
Hello, can I see your pass, sir... ah... whatever.
Putting the men's room in the tower, what was I thinking?
2XD341, calling
Ryberg Control tower. Come in.
2XD341, this is Ryberg
Control tower. Go ahead.
O.K. to come in, Webb?
Are you decent?
All clear, Cal. Drift south about 20 miles per hour.
Hi, Webb. what's Cal's ETA?
- 1410, but he's late—
- Half an hour late.
That's my boss.
The only guy in the world who can travel by jet and still be late.
Duh, I made a funny, heh heh.
- Where are you?
- Look out the window.
Look out,
President Clinton!
Maverick!
Could I love him more?
Ah damn, I spilled my
Big Gulp.
Should we be seeing this?
Nothing! Nothing!
Cal, what's wrong?
I have no control.
I keep eating and eating!
Cut loose, Cal! Bail out!
I can't. I'm too low.
I've got the blues so bad, uh huh.
Jerking around must have caused a flameout.
No power.
No nothing!
No Tickee!
No Shirtee!
Green Acres!
Well, suddenly I have a refreshing mint flavor.
Early LSD tests in the
Air Force.
This is a job for
Weenie-man!
Eat at Joe's. Eat at Joe's.
Eat at Joe's.
Wow, they're ringing!
Now he knows what the world sounds like to Pete Townshend.
Into the Weenie-mobile.
Weenie-man away!
I'd like to thank me for flying me Airways.
- Uh, there's a green switch.
It was there all the time! - D'oh!
G.I. Joe action-set.
Nerdy Joe not included.
- Cal, you okay?
- Okay.
What happened?
How'd you bring it in?
- I didn't. Couldn't.
- I died.
- What do you mean you didn't?
- Controls went out.
- Huh?
- That's right. No controls, no power.
The plane died up there.
- I should be dead.
- Did you bring me a toy?
Cal, I know everybody's seeing flying saucers and screwy lights up in the sky.
Well, you can put me in the booby hatch too, because, so help me, I saw this ship turn a bright green up there.
- Are you sure, Joe?
- Positive.
- Did you hear anything?
- Yes.
A high-frequency howl, very high, all the time your ship was—
- Green?
- Green?
- Did Webb see it?
- Unless he's blind.
- Check him.
- Right.
Oh, and, Joe, until we find out what happened, all three of us were blind.
I'll go pop Webb's eyes out.
¿So, was being green fun?
- Okay, I don't wanna talk about it anymore.
- I was just wondering, I mean...
- I've always wanted to...
- No. Shut up.
- How's the little giant? - Growing up.
Getting ready to astound the world.
Let's take a look.
I figured that.
She's all ready and waiting.
Wow, that's one hell of a
View-Master.
Oh yeah, this is when science didn't have to have any specific purpose.
Lowering the cylinder.
Inserting the breakfast pastry.
The secret government Eggo project.
Contact Dr. Jemima.
I love the blueberrie ones best.
- Increase the rate of reaction.
- Start warming the syrup.
Yum.
Check rate of radioactive decay.
Increase the Flash Gordon noise and put more science stuff around.
Positive. Same it was the whole week you were away.
- What did the committee say?
- Oh, they were a little excited.
A little!
Oh my god, my waffle!
Oh, the humanity!
Fries are up!
Oh no, you're flooding it!
Zero reading.
- The X-C condenser must have shorted out again. - Get the spare.
- Burned out yesterday!
- Oh, we can't have nice things!
Our liquorice ice cream cones melted!
And don't ask me why I didn't order some new ones. I did.
X-C condensers in an envelope?
Must be a gag dreamed up by the receiving department.
I ordered two X-C condensers, and supreme equipment sent me these beads.
He touched me!
You say they're a gag, but they're condensers.
I checked one for capacity and voltage on the meter.
- And blew it to bits.
- Yeah,
After it held to 33.000 volts and no leakage.
Where's my gun?
If that were true, we could build a generator,
One that would supply electric power to run an entire factory.
Sort this, deliver that.
I'll make 'em all pay!
Ah, the script has finally arrived!
- Morning. - Morning.
- Sign here.
Wilt Chamberlain.
- I don't like you.
- Thank you.
Oh, my Niels Bohr swimsuit calendar has arrived!
- What have you got?
- I don't know! There's no return address.
Oh, I hope it's my lederhosen.
How do they get blow up one day in here.
"Electronics service,
Unit no. 16."
Give to daddy.
Well, I'll read this on the crapper.
"A catherimine tube with an endiom complex of +4."
- What are they talking about?
- I don't know, but this outfit has them.
This isn't paper.
It's some kind of metal.
No sir, that's paper.
"Interocitor incorporating planetary generator."
"Interocitor with volterator... with astroscope."
Hey, Ms. Interocitor.
- Here's something my wife could use in the house: - ¿A man?
"An interocitor incorporating an electron sorter."
Although she'd probably gain 20 pounds while it did all the work for her.
Cal, you bitch!
According to this, there's no limit to what it can do.
Laying a four-lane highway at a mile a minute would be a cinch.
Cal, maybe we've been working too hard.
"Complete line of interocitor parts... incorporating greater advances than hitherto known in the field of electronics."
- Look, there's Waldo!
- What exactly is an interocitor?
I don't know, and I don't want to know.
- Just love me!
- Well, I do.
I want to know what it is and what it does.
And if I can break it.
- Order the list of parts on these pages.
- How we gonna build it?
These symbols— they're like a foreign language.
And I'm hungry!
Anyway, we don't know the address.
You ordered the condensers from supreme by teletype.
Yeah.
Which means that somebody intercepted that order and sent us those beads.
Here, try it again.
You're too darn smart.
And handsome!
I may be the dumbest man who ever walked this Earth, Joe.
No argument here.
Ah, been ordering from the
Adam and Eve collection again, hmm.
Joe, I'm one of these boxes.
Find me!
Here's the invoice.
No charge and no address.
Listen to this: "No interocitor part can be replaced.
Bear this in mind while assembling."
Use only genuine interocitor parts.
Well, let's start unpacking.
Cal, are you gonna work naked again?
There, it's done.
What do you think?
But before unpacking...
D'oh!
There's 2,486 parts.
2845, sir.
Each part is cross-indexed into a symbol pattern.
Shouldn't be too hard at all.
Sure. A snap, maestro.
Only, uh, where do we start?
Right here.
At goofy clown face.
Industry, science and technology!
Big men putting screwdrivers into things...
turning them, and adjusting them!
Build your own atom storage box!
Bringing you state-of-the-art in soft serve technology!
Pulls off caps of any size jug, bottle, or jar!
And it really, really works.
You know what my kids would say:
- You're not my real father!
- "Dig this crazy, mixed-up plumbing."
Plug it in, Joe.
We'll see what happens.
He doesn't even have kids.
Poor, deluded Joe.
Oh, please, say we can get the Sci-Fi channel. Please, oh please, oh please...
Look at this. Uh.
Comes with a Garth Brooks CD.
- Now what do I do?
- Clear your screen, please.
Okaay, Dr. Goofy!
You... can hear me?
- Of course.
- Duh.
Use the intensifier disk, the one in your hand.
Any time, Einstein!
Place it in position on your right.
Now, throw it at
Joe really hard!
This... tss... uh... thing... goes on the what's-this here.
Now turn the control
18 degrees to the left.
17. One more. Wait, back.
Oh! Well, that works too.
It's the amazing Technicolor cheese wedge!
Nanoo nanoo!
You have successfully accomplished your task, Dr. Meacham.
You've assembled an interocitor, a feat of which few men are capable.
- Who are you?
- I'm called Exeter.
Doug Exeter.
I'm a scientist, like yourself.
Shall we say a... a colleague.
My colleagues don't materialize out of strange machines. They're flesh and blood.
And so am I, Dr. Meacham, as I hope you'll soon find out.
- Grrr. Grrr. - ...although I admit at the moment, I do appear immaterial.
But no matter.
I represent a group which is seeking scientists of exceptional ability.
Do you know any?
All prospects must pass an aptitude test, which you've just done.
- Damn... where do I control... damn, jees.
- ...only I don't remember applying for any job.
You didn't—
I beg your pardon, Mr. Wilson.
Your camera will pick up nothing but black fog.
Oh, it's a Goldstar!
Images on the interocitor don't register on film.
- Put it away, Joe.
- Go lie down.
To continue,
Dr. Meacham,
We test out people without their knowledge.
We leave nothing to chance.
Except the chance that I'm not interested in you or your group.
Come, come, doctor. It's not possible that a man of your scientific curiosity... wouldn't want to find out who I am, where I come from,
If I have pants on.
Wouldn't give his right arm for more examples of our superior technical knowledge.
I think I can assume, Dr. Meacham, that you're sufficiently... intrigued to come to an immediate decision.
We'd like you to join our... team, as you might say, at once.
You'll make arrangements to leave immediately.
Wait a moment.
I didn't say—
At 5:00 Wednesday morning, our plane will land at your field.
It will wait exactly five minutes and then depart.
Whether I'm aboard or not?
Nanoo.
Hi there.
Place the catalog on that table with the blueprints.
Open it to the underwear section. Yes!
Alright, I'll do it, you big-headed freak.
Is this metal?
I got a bet with Joe.
Now stand aside, please.
You too, Mr. Wilson.
No, farther towards the
Kill Zone, please.
Yeah. God, I'm good.
Dear God, I left the iron plugged in!
Come here, you big dumb dope.
Quick! Get the baking soda!
Well, Cal, there's nothing left for you to break!
Boy, the landlady's gonna be mad!
- Are you boys cooking up there?
- No!
- Are you making an interocitor?
- No!
- You okay?
- Okay.
- Within reason.
- If there is any reason around here.
What with all the shenanigans and goings-on.
Now that you have exploded, any words for our listeners?
There's no reading now.
- Cal.
- Yes, Joe?
I just like saying "Cal."
- Whoever that Exeter is, i don't like him.
- Don't you, Joe?
- That's 'cause you're a puss.
- What? What?
Hey!
He was right about one thing.
I look good on a beret.
I'm gonna be on that plane.
Oh, hey wait, what's that! Alright.
- Let's get out of here!
- This will take a while.
Ah! Minor film break.
Happens all the time.
I know exactly what to do.
My plan for breaking Mike's will, by making him watch this horrible movie, continues as planned.
I should be ruling the world by, uh,
6:00, 6:30 at the latest...
That Cal fella, what a maroon!
Who'd be stupid enough to give him a laboratory or let him fly a jet?
- I like Joe.
- Yeah, and if it were me flying that baby, and I had a low altitude flameout like that,
I'd just reduce my elevators, dip the nose and fire up the engines.
- You don't know how to fly!
- Sure I do!
I'm fully instrument-rated for
Microsoft Flight Simulator.
- Well then you fly the Satellite of Love?
- Yeah.
What, this thing?
No, I can't do that, see,
'cause...
It's not the same, there's no air foil so there's no ability to turn when you're up in the...
All right, all right. Fine, you two.
Spread out, spread out.
What do ya do with a drunken sailor, early in the morning! Hay-ho and up she—
Okay out baby, out.
Well don't come crying to me when you get us all killed!
Yeah, right.
Let's see here.
Hey, this is going to be easier then I thought.
- Help!
- Hey Mike, you hit something!
It's the hubble!
You killed the hubble!
- Gypsy, could you please get that—
- Uh huh. No way!
This is you're dishwashing liquid!
You soak in it!
Ah! Ah! The manipulator arm!
The manipulator arm!
- Carefully... carefully... wait...
- That's it! That's it!
- It's only 6 billion dollars. Remember.
- Hope you're insured, Mike!
It's only the most expensive satellite ever built.
Near. Very fragile.
No, wait. Very fragile.
Better leave a note on the windshield, Mike.
Back up, and slow again.
Wait. Don't.
Don't do that!
Sorry. It's...
Now, I'm just gonna release it gently, like a sparrow into the night sky.
Good night, sweet Hubble.
And a flight of angels sing thou to thy rest.
Oh, good one, Mike.
But, how could it do that?
It couldn't possibly...
Oh, great, and now we have Movie Sign.
Go on. I'll take care of this.
- Mike broke the hubble!
- Boys.
Mike broke the hubble!
Put me on intermittent, Joe.
- Cal, won't you reconsider?
- I did... all night.
Didn't you hear me?
And, as a committee of one, I came to a series of decisions... at exactly the fifth cup of coffee.
I had to pee.
One: Whatever scientific knowledge this Exeter character has, should be in our textbooks.
Two: Joe Wilson, my able assistant, knows enough about a certain experiment to carry on without me for awhile.
I'm not sure of that, Cal.
Look, Joe, my committee decided
I'm expendable.
- Nothing you can say will change that.
- You always were an obstinate—
Oh, well,
I'm not worried.
Not even a moth equipped with a lightning bug could fly in here this morning.
So no plane is—
You know, all the problems of a hunky guy and a wormy sidekick...
...don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world.
Hey, it's a moth equipped with a lightning bug!
- Let go of my hand, Joe.
- He made it!
Well, I don't like long goodbyes.
There's a letter for you on the end table.
Joe? Joe? Watch out for the prop, Joe...
I'll understand if you assist other scientist, Joe...
Scram, Lumpy.
Hello, Mr. Magic plane passengers.
Hello, it's outside... hello?
Ironically, they overbooked the flight.
How about rustling me up a drink, sweet cheeks? ¿Hello?
I'm your pilot, Claude Rains; your co-pilot, Harvey the Rabbit...
Can I... get a pair of those little wings?
I've been a good junior pilot. Hello?
No pilot.
He must be having a rum and coke somewhere.
No windows.
Cal, you'll really be flying blind.
Please be seated, Dr. Meacham.
And welcome aboard.
You are being kidnapped by The Light FM.
Ugh, what are you doing?
You're sitting on me!
A seat belt is not required, doctor.
You commie.
Please clear the stairs.
That means you, Wormy.
- Thank you.
So long, Joe.
I'll be dropping you a card.
Cal, get off right away! This whole thing smells to high heaven!
Cal, I'm beggin' you.
Don't go!
Cal! Cal!
I'm stuck!
Your in-flight movie is:
Fearless.
There goes a stupid, stupid man.
I'm gonna curl up in his sock drawer, and sleep for days.
There's probably some kid with a big forehead, kicking the back of the seat right now.
Oh, Tammy, lower!
Yeah, that's right!
Shh, shh. We're in a whole lot of trouble.
Get your parachute on. Should I wake him?
Ah, football practice... uh...
Good morning,
Dr. Meacham.
Good morning, boys!
Hope you slept well.
'Cause it's time to die.
They're forcing him to visit
Branson, Missouri.
Cal, honey, put your shoes on.
We're at grandma's.
Hello! Where can I empty my hat?
He's flown into a Flemish painting
I claim this land for Spain!
So, the aliens live in Hooterville?
Ah, there are too Woodies in this scene.
- Where am I?
- Georgia.
I kind of expected
Neptune or Mars.
Or Neptune...
Exeter asked me to greet you.
I'm Dr. Ruth Adams.
Ruth Adams! But this is wonderful.
I never expected—
This.
Ruth, I'm Cal Meacham.
Hello, is it anybody home?
Dr. Meacham, of course.
Four or five years ago, conference on... thermal problems in nuclear reactors.
- Boston, wasn't it?
- Vermont!
We were lecturing to a symposium of graduate students.
Summer, three years ago.
After classes, we'd go swimming in a little river near the school.
You were an awful sissy about that icy water.
Shrinky Dink, remember?
Now, Ruth, don't tell me you've forgotten.
Come on, dummy!
Oh, I'm sorry.
Dr. Meacham, all I can say is I'm deeply flattered... and maybe a little envious of the girl you've mistaken me for.
And now I think Exeter is waiting to greet you.
She wants me.
Alright, see if this jogs your memory.
Bad dog.
We did it, and you know it.
Mike, can I have a car like that?
You can't drive.
I can drive. I'm an excellent driver.
I'm not wearing my underwear.
Oh, there's gonna be a
Mary Kay convention going on too,
so it's gonna be kind of weird.
The elevators down to
Exeter's slave quarters.
Our laboratories.
That's not funny, Ruth.
I was a slave.
Our living room, social center, library.
Mosh pits.
This is Exeter's office and study.
Not exactly what you expected, Dr. Meacham, is it?
- Good morning, doctor.
- Good morning, doctors.
Reverend Moon.
Ms. Hathaway.
Just throw these coats on
Exeter's bed.
Heil Hitler!
- Guten morgen, Doktor.
- Guten morgen, Herr Doktor.
Engelberg, from Munich. The doctor's out for his morning constitutional.
He's been here a week, but his English and my German—
Eeh, Charlie Rich!
He goes through a lot of Brylcreem.
Don't mention his head.
Who's that one?
That's Brack, one of
Exeter's assistants.
But you'll find them all very helpful.
What language do they speak?
Anything you wish:
English, Hindustani, Congoese...
- Kokokupikekeke...
- Anything.
- Dr. Meacham. Good morning.
- Good morning.
Please come in, both of you.
Glad you could join us here at the Buddy Ebsen Society
- Sit down.
- Dr. Adams!
Oh, yes, Steve!
What's this
'and the rest' crap?
About that nuclear decay factor, Ruth,
I'm afraid my equation just doesn't seem to work.
I was hoping you could find time to go over it with me later.
I still think the basic principle is all right.
Maybe we can trust—
Yes, well, thank you, Dr. Adams.
Oh, there you are,
Dr. Adams.
I was just reminding
Dr. Meacham... that I'd promised to produce some of his colleagues in the flesh.
May I use you as exhibit A?
I'm afraid Dr. Meacham isn't too happy with me.
At the airport, he was sure we were old friends.
Obviously, I was wrong.
The lady hardly remembers me.
- What is more important is—
- Who we are, what we're doing here.
Why I have a picture of a burger on the wall.
Dr. Meacham...
We're not hiring.
I represent a group of scientists who work with but one purpose:
To put an end to war.
Naturally, such a goal can't be attained without experts of superior ability:
- Men of vision...
- Jesus, what a head...
...gathered here, exchanging information daily...
Oh, that smell?
Oh, wow.
We hope to achieve exciting new techniques,
Leap years ahead of the others.
- I don't think I need tell you how effective our voices...
- Ah, terrible...
...will be when the world learns of our achievements.
- Well, there you have it.
- I'll let her open her.
- Nothing new, perhaps, but then, what is?
- Your head?
However, let me assure you, doctor, that we are dedicated men and women, and as such, we can accomplish wonders.
- Well...
- Into the hot tub?
What do you think of us?
This all sounds great,
Mr. Exeter...
- ...but why me?
- We like your skull.
- Dr. Meacham...
- How.
...we happen to know that you're on the threshold... of discovering limitless amounts of free nuclear energy,
More specifically, the conversion of lead into uranium.
Dr. Adams here has been working along the same lines as you have, perhaps just a step behind you, although I might add that both of you are way ahead of anyone else in your field.
Be careful. Exeter will flatter you to death.
The truth is never flattering,
Dr. Adams.
You fine foxy lady.
Now suppose you relax and think it over.
Suppose when I do, I find
I can't go along with you?
Could we still go out sometime?
Naturally, we'll expect you to be discreet about what you've seen here.
Otherwise, you're free to leave,
Dr. Meacham. As free as air.
Hey, Kreskin, quit hoggin' the bottle!
Hey, Mao, try this!
It'll knock your socks off!
There you go,
Mr. B.
So that's squirrel pudding, hmm.
Hey, the professor's crying!
She's drunk again!
Whatever.
What do you think of Mr. Mozart, Exeter?
I'm afraid I don't know the chap.
I'm not an alien!
My mind must have been wandering.
Your composer, of course.
Our composer?
He belongs to the world.
Yes, indeed.
I'm not an alien.
The dinner, Exeter, was even more perfect than you promised.
Now if you'll excuse me, I could do with some fresh air myself.
He's gonna get high.
Would you care to join me,
Dr. Adams?
Uh. No?
You, Dr. Carlson?
It's your turn to walk the Cal.
Why don't you?
Show him the grounds.
I dare you!
We won't start cracking the whip on Meacham until tomorrow.
Then I ram my ovipositor down your throat and lay my eggs in your chest.
But I'm not an alien!
Don't leave me with the Germans!
They didn't eat their fruit cups!
- That's quite a group Exeter has collected. - Quite.
That's Dr. Hu Lin Tang.
I love Tang!
Tang's field is tritanium, the same as Dr. Engelberg.
Dr. Marie Pitchner, U-235.
Dr. Blorfield, plutonium.
Whoop dee shit.
Hmm, that puts all of us in the production of nuclear energy, doesn't it, Carlson?
What are you getting at, Meacham?
Why no biochemists, electronic experts, mechanical engineers...
People equipped to make practical application of the energy the rest of us produce?
I seem to remember that was part of Exeter's pitch.
We try to make it a rule around here, Doctor, not to discuss our work after hours.
Now how about that fresh air?
How about you and Dr. Adams showing me my laboratory instead?
How about you lick me?
After all I've heard today,
I can hardly wait... to add my little contribution to the good work.
This way, doctor.
- I call dibs on Ruth.
- Dibs. - Dibs! - D'oh!
Not much of a laboratory...
...oh, it's the elevator. I see, I get it.
Now, does this clip need any set up?
- It may be true...
- You may kiss the scientist...
- ...but are you sure?
- We're 30 miles from nowhere.
Steve and I know. We've tried.
And if we did get out, who'd believe all this?
Ugh, hair ball...
I don't blame you doctors for being excited about working for Exeter.
It's a rare privilege.
He's a rare man.
Our little Neutron gave us away.
He felt the impulses.
That cat. I could—
Put Neutron under the thought transformer?
Why not, Brack? And perhaps you'd like me to step in with him.
Smush my big white alien forehead.
Turn it off, Brack.
Our friends won't be giving us any more information tonight.
I'll put you in the bitch transformer...
Here's a sketch of the interocitor.
I also have rough notes on its working controls.
It's guesswork mostly but better than nothing.
Not much...
And these are portraits of Exeter and Brack.
Do you notice the peculiar indentations in both their foreheads?
Nooo!
This is the one we're really proud of, Cal.
We discovered this a week ago two miles south of here.
The side of this hill has been hollowed out, and here's an acre of canvas covering the excavation.
You tell me what's in there.
Uh, pudding?
Steve wanted to go back and find out what was inside, but...
I guess I got cold feet.
Just like Vermont.
Still a sissy.
God, I hate you.
They're fine, Steve.
When we get out of here,
I'll have them framed at my own expense.
If we get out.
Ah, you sissy. Sissy cat,
I can take you too, you puss!
He's just hungry.
No, please! I can't digest milk!
Good-bye, Neutron.
I've got some big foreheaded sissy butt to kick.
Mr. and Mrs. Howell's hut is really nice.
Yeah, let's slip away undercover of afternoon
in the biggest car in the county.
Good. You will keep in contact until moment of departure.
Then remove all evidence of installation. That is all.
And don't forget to punch out.
I ought to hit you.
Take over.
And don't screw it up.
Jerk.
Now, it's time for The Brak Show.
It's The Brak Show, starring me— I'm Brak.
It's The Brak Show and
I've got lots of great guests.
Meanwhile, Ness and his men speed toward Capone's hideout!
So, Professor, you made this entirely out of bamboo, huh?
Eat my photons, smallheads!
Why are they all sitting in front?
We're sitting ducks in this thing.
If we're gonna make the airport, we'll have to do it on foot.
When I stop, we'll pile out.
Take cover fast.
Sounds like a really crappy plan, but okay!
Suckers!
Steve! Steve!
I'm a little busy!
I regret nothing!
Uh, yes, very nice, yes!
Oh, I have tubes in my ears!
And his coffin will be made entirely of coconuts, thank you.
We'll try and make the airport. Let's go.
Well, they dried off quickly.
Heh hey, watch the hand, Cal!
Regis and Kathy Lee are
The Fugitive.
- Is it flyable?
- It should be.
Exeter keeps it here for the staff.
She's hard on a cocktail dress.
My other plane is a jet, you know?
What do you think about that?
That's what happens when you leave a potato in a microwave!
Yeah, I'm beginning to think they're not from around here.
I bet you they're
English, or Canadian.
They're pulling us up!
I just know they're gonna probe my anus.
¡Captain, the Klingons have us in their tractor beam!
They got sucked up into a Jiffy Lube.
So, this is Denver's new airport.
Yes, things are going exactly as planned.
If I don't miss my guess,
I think this has something to do with those white-haired fellows.
Ah, thank you, Thing.
So, they worship the Everlasting Gobstopper?
You know, those helmets don't really hide their foreheads that well.
Two for Dinner?
Good.
Remain here.
Dad, your friends are here!
Our two passengers are very sensitive to heat.
The passengers are here.
So why they put the toilet in the middle of the room?
Allow me to welcome you.
Welcome.
I'm sorry that our visit below had to be terminated so dramatically, but time allowed for nothing else.
I can assure you we mean you no harm.
Like Steve Carlson and Engelborg?
Like the others in that house?
- What happened was beyond my control.
- What happened was mass murder.
We're not all masters of our souls, Meacham.
That's a nice little phrase coming from you.
I learned it on Earth.
That's 1 for Exeter. Ouch!
The two of you are beginning a strange journey...
Mawwige! a journey that no Earth people have ever undertaken before.
Whether you consider me a devil or a saint is unimportant.
Devil.
What is important is that you're here, on this spaceship.
Suppose then, for the time being, we call a truce.
As scientists at least, Meacham.
Isn't he sitting too close to the TV?
Ruth, don't tell me that, as a woman, you're not curious about our destination.
Having a sale, Ruth!
Where are we going?
Are we there yet?
- To a planet we call Metaluna.
- Metaluna?
There's no such planet in the solar system.
Metaluna lies far beyond your solar system, in outer space.
The stellarscope will convince you.
Come.
Well, I never Metaluna I didn't like.
What do you think, Ruth? Pretty good, ah?
Observer, prepare a view of the second quadrant, please.
Nanoo.
I won't ask you to condone what we've done.
We condone it.
All I ask is that when you understand the plight of my people, you try to have more sympathy for our deeds.
And that you'll give generously to the United Way.
- Earth.
- It's being left far behind.
My interocitor is way nicer than that one.
You have an interocitor?
Sure. Don't you?
- Well. Come on! We can use it to get back to Earth. - Really?
You've got an interocitor.
You should tell me these things!
Interocitor. Interocitor. Let's see here.
Under the peanut brittle.
Nope, nope...
Let's see. A Monkeys album, shoestring potatoes.
Hey! A can of hamdingers, isn't it?
No interocitor. A spirograph...
I know it's around here, somewhere.
...a sweatsock there.
Oh, there's my Etch-A-Sketch!
Trackball, never worked. A jar of tamales.
Another can of hamdingers...
Why all the underpants?
They're... full?
Oh, these.
- I collect them.
- Huh.
Hey, a chainsaw!
Wait a second, Servo.
You do have a interocitor.
I've been using it to make hot chocolate.
Well, let's see what this baby can do.
- Would you take those off?
- Hey!
She'll be ridin' six white horses...
Man, you guys scared the living daylights out of me!
It's working! Hey, hi!
It's Exeter there?
Nah, him and Brack went down to
Headbutt Days for Shelly.
I gotta meet 'em in the beer tent in about fifteen minutes, so I gotta get going, 'kay?
No wait, we're trapped in space!
Can we use this thing to get back to Earth?
I don't know.
Jees. Let's see.
Maybe this does something.
Crap. That's not it.
Hang up.
Okay. Did you use the intensifier disk?
Yes!
Turned the controls
18 degrees to the left.
Did that.
Are you in Europe.
Do you need an adapter?
No.
Well look, I don't know anything about this thing.
Maybe this does something.
Oops. It didn't work.
Okay, well, I'll be sure to tell
Exeter to give you a call...
- Bye! - No wait! Hold on!
You have to help us!
Wait, help!
Auntie Em! Auntie Em!
Surprise!
Like, who doesn't have an interocitor, you collective heads of knuckle!
Now, get back in the theater, you ninnyhammers!
And remember: I know who you are, and I saw what you did. Now, scat!
I'm the God!
I'm the God!
Ah! They're going 75, so they'll be there in three billion years.
Follow me, if you will.
Exeter, what are you using for power?
How are you controlling the fantastic temperature on this ship?
What's to prevent us from floating around like a bunch of balloons once we leave Earth's gravity?
To answer the last question first:
Shut up. we create our own gravitational field, which means that... no matter what position our ship takes in space, we here inside remain right side up.
But if we're going to get you to Metaluna alive, there's a little procedure you'll have to go through.
Oh, yeah! My anal probe!
What are you doing to them?
We're hickory-curing them.
Metaluna's atmospheric pressure is like that in your greatest oceans.
Just like you.
If we entered Metaluna's orbit without conversion, we'd be crushed to death.
But in going from Metaluna to Earth, the tissues of our bodies would dwindle.
We'd disintegrate completely.
- Correct, Meacham,
- You get a cookie.
If we're fortunate enough to return to Earth.
So, you're not giving us a ride back then?
Okay, Bachelor Number Two...
Which one do you want, honey?
Ladies and gentlemen...
A Flock of Seagulls.
Jees, I hope they wipe down the tubes when they're done with them.
Uh, yeah. Good meeting, everyone.
Same time tomorrow?
- Brack?
- Yes.
You will prepare the doctors for the tubes.
I just got out of the tub, man!
You'll change into clothes such as ours, especially conditioned for life on Metaluna.
Come with me.
What size of skull-dome do you wear?
Brack has visible panty line.
Come on, you couple of single-stomach, microcephalic bilobes.
So, Brack.
Is that polish?
Or... well no,
I guess it wouldn't be.
There's a shuttlecraft approaching, Captain.
- Do you want me to talk like
George Takei some more Mike? - No.
As you wish, Captain.
As you wish.
Recognize me now,
Ruth?
Place your hands above the rails.
They're magnetized.
And if your hands were metal, that would mean something.
What?
There's an intercom system in the tubes.
You may converse as long as you're able to.
But it will be billed to your room, so don't overuse it.
Now, raise your hand if you want the hot wax
I hope you both like sulfur!
Good luck!
Let me know what happens!
What do you know!
Mine smells like bacon!
Must feel like they're inside a bong!
- Ruth?
- I farted.
Yes?
You okay?
And you?
Feel like a new toothbrush.
So rub me in a circular motion on your gums
Hey, a big Swedish underarm crystal
Hey, keep it on the road!
We're in the tubes back here!
Uh, my contents have shifted!
- Ruth—
- I farted again.
Well, this ought to kill them!
I am Metaluna.
Well, the Tangerine Dream music is good.
It's Christy Turlington and Kate Moss!
Oh gross!
I saw Cal's pubic bone!
¡Now you're playing
Simon!
Should I tell Ruth she has an extra rib?
- Cal—
- I farted.
Enemy-controlled sector. This is master control awaiting instructions.
Bill, pick up line 4!
Jesus, what did you do to them?
You'll energize only as necessary.
Conserve power.
Avoid contact with enemy until safety of ship is endangered.
Make big money at home!
Sharpen saws, and earn extra cash.
You didn't see my skeleton, did you?
Uh, you might want to wait a minute before opening Cal's up
Did you have Kenny G playing in your tube?
Come away from the nasty man.
You'll feel stronger in a few moments.
I feel safe with you Brack.
You have a gentle touch.
Now I know you both feel as though you could sleep for at least a thousand years,
But then you'd miss observing our approach to Metaluna,
And with your curiosity, you'd never forgive me for that.
You know, our chair technology is light years ahead of yours.
Quiet everyone!
All My Children is on.
Hey, Laser Floyd, cool!
Observer, a closer view.
View in third quadrant.
Contact in two time periods.
This planet should comb its hair over its bald spot.
View in second quadrant.
Contact in one time period.
You know, that's one butt-ugly planet you guys come from.
View in first quadrant at ionization wave.
Ew, it's Michael Stipe's head!
What you're observing may well be the beginning of the end... for our world.
Well, I hope so!
The Zahgon meteors are beginning to get through our ionized layer.
That haze, a feeling of intense radiation.
As you can well imagine, such a screen requires... the output of great amounts of atomic energy.
And you're running out.
That's why you were sent to Earth.
And why you sent for us.
You need uranium.
In gigantic quantities.
Our own deposits are exhausted.
As our power diminishes, our protection fails.
But, uh, we do have a very active theater community!
What kind of shithole planet is this?
That's enough.
Normal view.
Normal view.
Normal view.
Normal view!
Normal view!
Entering ionized layer.
Hey, they're landing in
Tommy Chong's backyard.
Oh, my washer load is off-balance!
Looks like Dr. Seuss designed their planet.
They're flying into a
Roger Dean album cover.
They're very into Yes in this planet.
International flights always get the gate furthest from the terminal.
Remember, we're parked in the Denubrian Slime Devil lot.
Hey, Prince's bedroom.
Looks like the stalls are all taken.
Welcome, Exeter. Observed your flight.
Almost counted you lost.
Your Earth creatures.
Dr. Adams,
Dr. Meacham.
I've given them as much indoctrination as possible.
Then you know that shortly... we can expect Zahgon to commence and sustain an all-out attack.
Our ionization layer must be maintained until our relocation is effected.
Relocation?
To where?
Shut your gob, small-head.
To your Earth.
Oh, I can see th... hey!
A peaceful relocation.
After the genocide, of course.
Do you still insist, Exeter, that we can allow any of these
Earth creatures to have free minds?
I do.
No... Yes...
Whatever you think!
I know them.
I've partied with them.
- I've lived with them.
- You have wasted our time.
- Thank you! - Take them to the thought transference chamber.
Yes, you all-high toilet hog.
Please come with me. I'm afraid you have no choice.
Okay. Bye bye!
Nice hannukah bush, by the way!
Ah, I see their
Patriots don't work either.
Our Zahgon friends seem to be hitting this prime sector quite regularly.
Uh, yeah?
Is that where it is?
In there?
Uh, golly, those doggone Zahgons are really licking us, huh?
Well, let's go get your brains scrambled.
My mind is my own and nobody's gonna change it.
Go, girl!
- I'm not going into that room!
- Nobody is. Come on!
Leona Helmsley!
I'm sorry.
I'd hoped to have prepared you somewhat beforehand. This is a mutant.
We have been bringing them here for ages to do menial work.
Why?
Thhey're similar to insect life on your own planet.
Larger, of course, with a higher degree of intelligence.
This one has been given orders to guard this corridor as long as we're here.
Oh, mommy!
I beg of you, go inside.
Cooperate voluntarily.
I give you my word you will not be harmed or your minds changed in any way.
- You'd defy the Monitor?
- I already have!
Do you believe him, Cal?
In this place,
I wouldn't believe my grandmother.
Is he wearing slacks?
Oh boy.
The kingdom!
Oh sure. Go on. Run.
Just because you have a skull.
The Jetsons 2:
After the Armageddon.
- The travel car! Come on!
- Where are we going?
The spaceship.
It's safer there.
Don't you understand?
Let it happen now.
Reeeally?
Meacham!
Ruth!
I love you!
Stand back, Exeter.
Meacham, believe me,
I want to help you.
You're holding a mutant turd!
Time is short.
Get into the car!
Go ahead.
Move that baby seat.
I kind of live out of my travel cart.
This is what went on in
Salvador Dali's head.
Now, I swear we parked on level C, just right next to...
Oh, shit.
He appears badly hurt.
Stay close to me.
Guten Tag! Sie greten?
Wie wollen eine Auto mieten!
Stand back.
I command you: stand back!
Acting!
Well, that seemed to go rather well.
I don't see what could possibly go wrong...
- Cal!
- No, you do it! Leave me alone!
Uh, I'll get coffee.
Oh, I'm very vulnerable there!
Oh, there goes the piano lessons!
Ah, I can't remember my dad!
Oh, come on you big blowed.
When in Chicago, visit the Museum of Science and Industry.
- Are you badly hurt?
- I'll be all right.
Close off all hatches.
Control room, quick!
Everyone picks on that one weak spot of my exoskeleton!
You dinks.
You crushed my nads.
Hey! The floors look great.
I'm all right.
And if you don't mind
I've been waiting all day for this.
Oh no, Tinkerbell's goin' down!
Pull up Tink!
That may be the last of them.
But probably it isn't.
Yes, they're concentrating all their attention on Metaluna.
Those flashes of light... they're meteors.
Hundreds of them.
The intense heat is turning Metaluna into a radioactive sun.
The temperature must be thousands of degrees by now.
Cooler by the lake.
- A lifeless planet.
- Yes, yes.
And yet—
Rents are reasonable.
...it's still serving a useful purpose, I hope.
- Yes, a Sun...
- Yes, yes. warming the surface of some other world, giving light to those who may need it.
Still, your whole family died.
That's a bummer, huh?
Now, into the converter tubes.
Uh, your liver is beginning to stick out there.
You might wanna tuck it back in.
- Ruth, you take the first tube.
You, the next. - What about you?
I'll use the third tube.
Oh, right. Sure.
Stupid question. Sorry.
Well. One weird day, huh?
Captain's log:
A bunch of our ship fell off and...
nobody likes me.
Cal and Exeter wake and bake everyday. Woo!
Will our Mystery Guest enter and sign in please?
It's the manager here?
Hello?
I hear you, ma'am.
Walls melting for you, too?
I didn't mean to scare you.
I'm just looking for the can.
Say, where did you get those cute pants?
Oh, hey.
My grandma's legs.
Exeter, are these tubes strong enough to keep him out?
Possibly.
- Well, no.
- He's bleeding badly.
In a very few moments, the pressure should destroy him.
Shall I compare thee to a summer's d— oh...
Okay. Hold it together.
Rise above it. Suck it up.
You gotta cut me Mick!
Cut me!
And I busted a zit on my shoulder. Great!
Run, Ruth, run!
Brilliant strategy.
Thanks, Napoleon.
Oh, I've ought to do something.
What are you stuck up?
Too high and mighty for the Mutant, huh?
C'mon!
Give Uncle Scrotor a hug!
Not since Ted Kennedy in a Barney suit!
- Oh, I stood up too fast!
- Ugh, he squirted.
Thank God I saved you.
Ah, I fell on my keys.
Yes, go away, you bad monster, you'll get more of the same!
Self-cleaning mutant.
Leaves only the fresh scent of pine.
Oh, we'll get you another one.
Raspberry World, for all your raspberry needs. Off the beltway.
Hey, check this out!
Baywatch is on.
- Ah, just like we left it.
With the USA in charge. - Yes!
I think maybe we should slow down a little?
Our speed is diminishing.
We're now in the atmosphere of Earth.
Your plane is where you left it: in the cargo hold.
I think.
A conventional way for you to return to Earth, I admit,
At least you've got a planet. but perhaps the most practical.
May your forehead grow like the mighty oak.
Where are you going?
I'm fine.
I'll just kick around here.
Our universe is vast, full of wonders.
I'll explore.
Yeah, that's it!
Perhaps find another Metaluna, a place inhabited by beings not unlike myself.
Maybe get a house, with some guys... I don't know...
You see, I'm more adventurous than you imagined me.
- Exeter...
- You dog...
- ...you're a liar.
- ...and I hate you.
You've used all your power bringing us here.
Even if you had a place to go, you couldn't make it.
I'll gas up in
Des Moines.
Come with us.
We'll heal your wounds.
No, Ruth, no. Ixnay!
I'm afraid my wounds can never be healed.
You've things to teach us.
Recipes to share.
Thank you.
We're over your Earth now.
It's time for you to go. Farewell.
I'm just dropping you at the
North Pole. Is that alright?
Ex... call, okay?
I mean that.
No, no. Go on, you kids.
I'll just be on the way. I'm fine.
You probably don't have a spare room anyway,
Do you?
Yo, right back at ya!
Go. Go, go, go.
Come on. Go.
Oh, so that's what a colon looks like!
Captain's log: I've lost my toupee and girdle...
and I can't leave my room.
Y'know, I hope they land right on Kenny Loggins.
Okay. Hands on ten and two; check space cushion; pull out in the— aah!
Oh great! Brack siphoned our gas!
Oh, Carl...
Cal.
Oh, Cal...
- Home.
- Thank God it's still here...
...and friday!
Hell, let's hangar this baby in then.
Spock!
Let's see how many times I can skip this thing!
Nope. Pay no attention to me.
I'm just a weather balloon.
Just some swamp gas.
"Service engine soon."
I wonder what that's all about.
A giant flaming hat was seen over the coast tonight...
Exeter thought he could squeeze one more trip to earth out of this jalopy.
I'll always love you, Br— Aah!
That's going to put your panfish down for a while.
Exeter died on impact. Brack was arraigned in superior court, county of Los Angeles.
In a moment, the results of that trial.
This Island Earth!
That movie was a breeze!
I dig those crazy
Metalunians, Mike.
The movie is over.
The experiment is complete.
And... if my calculations are correct...
Adjust for pi.
Mike's will should be broken just about now.
Broken?
- Hey Mike, your spirit feeling broken?
- Heck no. We're fine, Dr. Forrester.
In fact, we're just hailing ourselves a little Metaluna mix there.
Just call me Ruth, Mike!
Hey, check me out! I'm just like one of your insects. Larger, of course.
Come on, everybody!
Make with the smoke, man!
So, you're having a party, eh?
Well, every party needs a pooper!
Hey, look at that. Dr. Forrester's gone.
Alright. Now we'll never get back to Earth!
Hey, wait a minute.
I don't know why people leave during the credits.
- I always stay for the credits!
- Yeah, me too.
This is Orson Welles.
A good cast deserves another mention.
In the event that the first assistant director is unable to fulfill her duties...
Bix Skahill and his big band!
Two Brantsegs in one film.
What are the odds?
Puppet wranglers. There weren't any puppets in this movie?
And Dale Mather as the Beaver.
- Oh, I love Triskos, with Espinosa.
- Oh, and a little Herget down 'em...
- In the event that the first assistant camera is unable to... - Okay, alright.
Hey, they're on the blue line. They're over the blue line. Oh, nice assist by Brad Keely!
Come on down to L. Marie Ford.
Free hotdogs, and balloons for mom.
¿Linda Froiland. Isn't she in
Babes in Froiland?
- Andrea "Action Jackson" DuCane.
- That's good.
Julie Walker, Texas Ranger.
- In the event that the assistant production coordinator... - Okay, enough. - Sorry!
The winner, and still phorographer,
Mickey Kienitz.
So there's one guy who just grinds out keys all day?
- The Amazing Rando! - Watch Rando the Great construct sets with his very mind!
No, we've never met before, have we?
Craft services will be held at
10 am, Tuesday.
- Kurt "Band-Aid" Gensmer.
- Dan "Contusion" Dustin.
- Jim "Heart Attack" Robinson.
Oh, yeah. These are the guys that just sit in basement rooms and figure out ways to make elves disappear.
Avelino Deleon, brother of Ponce.
Here's Avelino in his rear-engined Lotus followed by Jaquilin Zietlow in a Ferrari.
We recorded at
Sync S-s-s-o-o-u-u-n-d.
- Excuse me, Magic Film and Video, but Rando will do all the magic on this film. - That "Rando" stuff kills me.
Uh, yeah. Bill Schwab. He's the guy that goes around attributing his own faults to other people.
Oh, right. The "projectionist."
"I Sing the Additional Grip Electric."
So, if you pick something up once, you're considered a grip.
And now we're just seeing guys who drove by the studio one afternoon.
We'd like to thank the people of St. Paul, who are, in alphabetical order, Anderson, Aaron, Anderson, Alan...
Energy Park, providing a safe place for energy to play.
This week at Energy Park, flugelhorn demonstration and magic by The Amazing Rando!
As long as we're thanking the whole entire world,
I'd like to thank a guy I know named Earl.
Eastman. He came out of the east to do battle with The Amazing Rando!

Oh, yeah, well how about the rights of that little girl?

The war between the Humans and the Cyborgs began 73 years ago.
Back in the year 2027.
10 years later the war was won by the Cyborgs.
They control the Earth and the Humans became their slaves.
There were a scientist who created a super-DNA gene...
...which would produce a man with extraordinary powers.
A woman, Zana, was chosen to give birth for this mutant human.
Zana knew where a special craft was hiden.
A craft stolen from the Cyborgs that can travel throught time.
Scch, Alex! You have to be quiet, until we know where we are.
Alex, I have to leave you my love,
I am sorry.
Please try to undestand. Some day you will return to our world.
You have Powers, Alex.
When you are ready this neckless will explain everything.
Goodbye my love.
They baby was called Alex after her famous ancestor.
And thou she was born in the year 2077 - the destiny of her life was forged in the late 20th century. in grimm Wootan, East Africa.
What's wrong....  whats happened, ....
News: A collection of goldcoins has been stolen from the museum in Mosar.
Three American student worker are suspected to have fled in an ultralight....
The government wants an evacuation of all villages  between Karu and Mosar.
The Wootan rebels started a new offensive.
And groups of American mercenaries has been hired by the rebel leadership.
They start to win the skirmishies and have already taken over the old uranium mine in Dabar.
Because of your accent.
My accent. I've learn English from mine workers.
You never had to learn English.
You came to us already knowing English.
What the hell are you, lass?
Such large muscles!
I pray that you're foreigner we can ransome.
You touch me and you're sick son of a bich!
Ooo... nasty talk for a yank we are going to eat.
- You are sick!
- Want to see something really sick, yank?
No, not me!
I told you to wait for me!
Lucky day.
I've got a captive.
The Americans pay dearly for their children.
I thought you were the one fighting for freedom.
Everyone has their home use.
Mine is to make the imperialists pay...
...in gold.
Look at all these muscles!
My god.
Come on, cut us free before the rebel show.
Come on.
I can help with that!... Please.
Hey, don't leave us, please!
Please, don't leave us!
- I'll take you to my plane.
- What plane?
I fly through to Mosar.
From there we return to the States.
My sister and I are really sick of this country and civil war, we just wanna go home.
My dad was an engineer, and he is dead.
- Who pilots?
- Me. It was my dads plane ...
He hid it before the rebels got us.
- Come on.
- OK. Fly me away from here.
Its a deal.
This cloths are hard to come under hat .
Whats the idea, hah?
It will help us get past the Rebels.
You pretend to be my prisoners.
Just remember, its a cover.
What is it?
Follow me.
Stupid idiot! You deserved to die.
My bulletproof vest is ruined!
You are really something.
Been here a long time, huh?
The old mining plant?
Yeah, we needed a fuel pump.
My father was forced to land the plane.
We were looking for a pump, when the rebels found us.
Dad was killed.
We run, we ended up up here.
You know the outpost is really close by.
Find the pump?
Yeah I can install it, when we get to the plane.
Only we had to do the first time. its was just to much for her, killing of our dad and everything
The mining plant is controlled by Wootan bandits. Too risky.
- It is our only chance?
- Yes.
My dad worked for the goverment.
What brought you to Africa?
My mother. Murdered by rebels.
Sorry.
It was a long time ago. I realy don't remember her. I grew up in a tribe.
- You sound like an American.
- Holy Cross missionary were Americans.
- So your village were is close by?
- It's gone. Everyone dead.
.... rebels.
- No ... devil.
- So whats the story of your life?
- What do you mean?
Well, you are pretty muscular aren't you, for a girl.
Its like you been here a long time.
Wait! Quick.
What ...... What? Come.
This is the only way to mine.
- I can not see anything.
- Now look. - Wait.
Find the girls.
- Try to escape and I kill you and your sister. 
- She is not my sister.
- And I can make a deal worth more than a rent. 
- How is that?
There is a treasure and a plane.
You take me to it and I split the looth with you.
What about her?
I do not need any more partners. Do you?
Give me the gun.
Shoot her.
Noo!
Drop your weapons.
Your bullets can't hurt me..
- Shitta.
- Shut up!
.... here. Find the white woman and terminate her.
She is in sector 17.
Concentrate patrol in there.
- What do you want?
An American. A rebel has her.
Information costs money.
Yes, yes something I want.
- Don't hurt me, please.
- Please?
- Come on you want the information or what?
- You know, we usually kill girls down here.
- Here you are.
- Where are they?
- There, up on the ridge.
Make in a hurry. Someone is gone a find us.
I sent scout to make sure we are safe.
Enyoy your life, we are going to be rich.
Until he is back we have time to change that!
- You saved me.
- Did I?
What do you think I liked it?
Just trying to stay alive.
I don't trust you. but I need with the plane.
Frame me, I'll kill you.
I just want out of here alive.
What, what is it?
What?
Get down, get down.
Do you want another one of your friends to die?
No! Oh!
You would be vaporized if you resist.
Remain in place.
Drop your weapon.
Why do you want me?
Because you are wanted by my superiors for your genetics.
Your mother brought you from our time to hide you.
My mother was from your world?
My world is a 100 years into the future.
It has takes me 20 years to locate you.
Now I scan you again to confirm your genetic code.
After I receive confirmation, you will acompany me back to my time.
- Can you still fly? I get you to the plane, can you still fly?
- What was  it?
- Now wait here.
Get it back. Put it down.
Put it down! Now!
That gold is mine!
Step away from the plane. Go on.
Mine alone!
I deserve all of it!
Emily!
Emily.
Emily.
Noo.
Aaaah.....
Come, come!
Please!
Aziz. Aziz.
Aziz, light!
Aziz... light.
Good.
We start again.
"When the three planets are in eclipse... the black hole, like a door, is open.
Evil comes... spreading terror and chaos."
See the snake, Billy?
The ultimate evil.
- Make sure you get the snake.
- Yes, I've got your snakes.
I got all the snakes.
When is the snake act supposed to occur?
If this is the five... and this is the one... every 5,000 years.
So, I've got some time then.
You bring them water.
Good boy.
I'll take it to them.
Go with God.
Be safe from evil.
You see here these different peoples, or symbols of people... gathering the four elements of life... water, fire, earth, air... around a fifth one.
A fifth... element.
Forgive me, Lord.
They already know too much.
Father.
How are you?
- Well. You have some glasses?
- Of course.
I'm so glad to see you.
It's the most extraordinary thing.
It's the greatest find in history.
You must be parched.
Oh, yes, yes.
I'm sorry.
It's like a battle plan.
Here the good.
Here the evil.
And here, a weapon... against evil.
I'm going to be famous.
Then let us toast to your fame.
To fame.
Salute.
You can't toast with water.
Billy, in my sack, the grappa.
This I don't understand.
This could be something... prehistoric.
I don't know.
But, wait.
Here.
Look, look.
They're here.
This man... this perfect being.
I know this is the key.
I know it.
This divine light they talk about.
What is divine light?
Aziz, light!
Much better.
Thank you.
My Lord.
Father, this is the most unbelievable thing I've ever seen.
Don't you think?
Are you German?
Lord...
I know he was about to discover everything.
But, no worry.
I was there in time.
Priest... you and those before you... have served us well.
But war is coming.
Stones not safe on Earth anymore.
This... is really amazing.
The fifth element.
Take the stones.
My Lord... if you take the weapon, we'll be defenseless... when evil returns.
In 300 years... when evil returns... so shall we.
Oh, Professor.
Professor.
Don't move!
I have a gun!
Please, understand.
They're our friends.
Friends?
Father, they've killed the Professor!
They're monsters!
I'll explain everything.
- You're with them?
- Look at me.
I am your friend.
- No, Father.
- Billy, look at me!
Please, put... the gun down.
Billy, no!
Hurry!
The wall is closing!
Here is your mission:
Pass your knowledge to the next priest... as it was passed to you.
I will do as you command, but... hurry, you still have time.
Time not important.
Only life... important.
I will fulfill my mission!
You can count on me!
I will pass the knowledge until your return.
Anything yet?
- Not even a temperature?
- The analyzers have jammed.
One shows a million degrees, the others minus 5,000.
Let's see it.
It's taking shape.
Send out a probe.
Ladies and gentlemen...
the President of
the Federated Territories.
On air with General Staedert in 30 seconds.
I saved this seat for you, Father.
President on the line.
We're in position.
I have to address the Supreme Council.
Just the facts.
There are no results from the chemical and molecular analysis yet.
All the calibers are overshot.
We're initiating
thermonucleatic imaging.
What you're saying is, you don't know what this is.
All we know is, it just keeps getting bigger.
Recommendation?
My philosophy is:
Shoot first and ask questions later.
I don't like uninvited guests.
All right, then.
Mr. President?
Priest Vito Cornelius,
expert of astrophenomenon.
I... have a different theory to offer you, sir.
You have 20 seconds.
Imagine that this... thing is not anything that can be identified... because it prefers not to be.
Wherever there is life... it brings death... because it's evil.
Absolute evil.
One more reason to shoot first.
Evil begets evil, Mr. President.
Shooting will only make it stronger.
Probe will obtain objective in five seconds.
Growth rate is at 27%.
Your theory is interesting, but we don't have time to go into it.
Time is of no importance.
Only life is important.
You're right.
That's exactly what we'll do.
We'll protect the life of 200 billion of my fellow citizens.
You may fire when ready.
Up-front loading of a 120-ZR missile.
Marker lights on the objective.
Its structure solidified on the surface.
I think it's anticipating the attack.
That denotes intelligence.
The most... terrible intelligence imaginable.
120's loaded.
The ship is in combat formation.
Missiles are loaded.
- Staedert.
- Yes, sir.
I have a doubt.
I don't, Mr. President.
What happened?
Can you hear me?
What happened?
- Did you destroy it?
- I'm about to.
The planet has increased diameter by 200%.
It's moving toward the ship.
What do we have that's bigger than 240?
Nothing, sir.
Staedert, do you hear me?
Get out of there.
I don't want an incident.
Do you hear me?
Get out of there.
Can you hear me, Staedert?
Do you understand?
Listen.
That's an order.
Do you understand me?
Do you hear me?
Get out of there!
Good God!
Four a day.
I'm tryin'.
To quit is my goal.
I'm up.
All right, I'm up.
God.
Hey, dog brain,
Finger here.
Hi, sweetie.
I love you too.
You haven't called me that
since basic training.
I was talking to the cat.
I forgot...
you prefer your cat
to the real thing.
At least the cat comes back.
Still pining
for that two-timing slut?
There's millions
out there.
I don't want a million.
I just want one.
The perfect one.
It don't exist, Major.
Yeah, I know.
What?
Picture of you.
- How do I look?
- Like shit.
Must be an old picture.
Bring me your hack for a six-month overhaul.
- Negative.
- A.S.A.P.
I don't need one.
Who sat next to you for 1,000 missions?
I know how you drive.
Finger, I drive a cab now... not a space fighter.
Tell me. How many points
you got left on your license?
Major, how many points?
At least 50.
Know what?
You gotta learn to lie better.
See you tonight.
Welcome to Paradise.
Welcome to Fhloston Paradise.
It's Ruby Rhod,
and I'll tell you live at five...
the winner of the super green
Gemini Croquette Contest!
The winner will go with me
for two days to Fhloston Paradise.
Tune in to Radio Cosmos.
Don't watch all day.
It'll rot your brain.
For a perfect world.
- Give me the cash.
- Been here long?
Long enough.
Give me the cash.
Is that a Z-140?
Alleviated titanium.
Neurocharged assault model.
Good thing for me it's not loaded.
It's not loaded?
You have to... push that yellow button to load it.
Take your time.
Want me to...
There you go.
Give me the cash!
That's a very dangerous gun.
Maybe you better let me hang on to this one for you.
You don't mind, do you?
You sure?
No. Take it.
I don't need it.
That's a nice hat.
You like it?
God!
Please enter your license.
Yes, just a minute.
Welcome, Mr. Dallas.
Good morning.
Sleep well? Me too.
I had a horrible nightmare.
Propulsion 2-X-4.
You have five points left
on your license.
Yeah, thank you for reminding me.
Have a nice day.
Why not?
You have 48 hours.
That's the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions.
- And then?
- Then it will be too late.
The goal of this thing is not to fight over money or power... but to exterminate life.
All forms of life.
You're telling me there's nothing that can stop this.
There is only one thing.
The Mondoshawan have in their
possession the weapon to defeat evil.
Four elements... gathered around a fifth... supreme being, the ultimate warrior... created to protect life.
Together they produce
"The Light of Creation."
Able to bring life to the farthest reaches of the universe.
But, if... evil stands there...
Then what?
Then light turns to dark.
Life to death... forever.
A Mondoshawan spaceship requests permission to enter our territory.
Give it permission to enter with our warmest regards.
Thank you.
Permission to enter granted.
Show time.
We are lost.
Aknot, we are connected to Earth.
Mr. Zorg's office.
It's Aknot.
I'm so glad to hear you, Aknot.
The mission is accomplished.
You'll have what you asked for
in a few hours.
Good.
I'll meet you at my factory.
The attack was by two unregistered warships.
Close all borders and declare a state of general alert.
Try to contact the Mondoshawans.
We owe them an explanation.
Three hundred years of waiting for nothing.
Go get some rest.
No.
The Mondoshawan...
I am their contact.
They will come for me.
This is government business.
I'll keep you informed.
The rescue team has reported from the crash site.
Any survivors?
Only one.
You call that a survivor?
A few cells still alive.
More than I need.
Have you identified it?
The computer went off the charts.
Normal human beings have 40 DNA memo groups... which is enough for any species to perpetuate.
This has 200,000 memo groups.
Sounds like a freak of nature.
Yeah, can't wait to meet him.
You okay?
Over here.
Excuse me.
General, I want to show you something.
This is a normal human DNA chain.
You, me, anybody, right?
Watch this.
The compositional elements of his DNA chain are like ours.
There's simply more of them, with infinite genetic knowledge.
Almost like this being was engineered.
Is there any danger?
We put it through the cellular hygiene detector.
The cell is, for lack of a better word... perfect.
Go ahead.
Mr. Perfect better be polite.
Otherwise, I turn him into cat food.
Activate it.
Tissue processing.
Ten seconds to ultraviolet protection.
This is the last phase.
The cells are bombarded by atoms which forces the body to react.
That means growing skin.
Wonderful.
Reconstruction complete.
Remove the shield.
I told you.
Perfect.
Thermal bandages.
I'd... like to take a few pictures... for the archives.
- What's she saying?
- I don't know.
Activate the phonic detector.
Is that thing solid?
- Unbreakable.
- Good.
If you want out... you'll have to develop those communication skills.
General alert.
Perfect.
Ladder on 18.
Two men with me.
The rest in the main ventilation.
This way.
Lady, stay calm.
This is the police.
There's nowhere else to go.
Slowly turn around and put your hands on the floor.
Do you understand?
She doesn't.
I think we need a flying unit.
This is the police.
This is the police.
We are processing your identification.
Put your arms up
and follow our instructions.
She has no file.
She dove off.
You just had an accident.
Yes, I know I just had an accident, you daffy bastard!
You have one point left
on your license.
Look out!
Left!
I can't believe it.
Shit.
Any survivors?
Hi.
Are you okay?
Boom.
Boom. Yeah,
I understand "boom."
Bada boom.
Big.
Big bada boom.
Big... bada big boom.
Big boom.
Yeah, big bada boom.
Bada boom.
Big boom.
Big bada boom.
You're lucky you're not dead.
This is a police control.
Please keep your hands
on the wheel.
You have an unauthorized passenger
in your vehicle.
We are going
to arrest her.
Thank you for cooperating.
Sorry, honey.
Looks like this is your ride.
Open the door.
Do what they say.
Sorry.
"Please... help."
I only have one point left on my license.
I need it to get back to the garage and get the cab a six-month overhaul.
You understand?
Can you please open the passenger door?
Please... help.
I can't.
I repeat... open the passenger door.
Yeah, yeah, sure.
Why not?
Thank you for your cooperation.
Help.
Finger's going to kill me.
Emergency!
Emergency!
One point has
been removed.
Yes, I know!
This is so stupid.
Assist in pursuit
of yellow cab.
Unit 47, we're on the way... after we finish lunch.
Two golden menus.
I'm too old, too tired and too hungry to go chasing some hot rod.
Thank you so much.
And I'm definitely too thirsty.
Look out!
We got lucky.
If they don't chase you after a mile, they don't chase you.
Maybe two miles.
Hang on.
Look, lady...
I only speak English and bad English!
Run an I.D.
I'm all for conversation, but maybe you can just shut up for a minute!
He's got a scan blocker.
Means he's a car thief.
Blast him.
I don't know what you did... but they are pissed off!
Hold on!
We're safe for a while.
You want to play soft?
I'll play soft.
You want to play hard?
Let's play hard.
If we get to the fog, we'll be okay.
If we make the fog.
How do they expect us to find anything in this shit?
We're just going to wait here until things quiet down if you don't mind.
Shit.
You okay?
Priest.
You don't need a priest, just a doctor.
Vito Cornelius.
What?
Priest.
Yes?
I'm looking for a priest.
The weddings are downstairs, my son.
Congratulations.
She's not my bride.
She's my fare.
She's looking for
Vito Cornelius.
The phone book said he lived here.
Yes, that's me, but I don't know who she is.
Nobody does.
No file, no I.D., nothing.
She's got a tattoo on this arm.
Tattoo?
Fifth... element.
Finger's going to kill me.
- Hey! Wake up!
- Who are you?
I brought the girl, remember?
The redhead.
She just dropped in on me.
Started speaking a bizarre language.
It's not bizarre.
It's the divine language.
It's the ancient language... spoken throughout the universe before time was time.
He's a she.
You noticed that.
Yes.
- It's a miracle.
- Miracle she's not dead.
Not a moment to lose.
Wake her up.
But gently, because this woman is... mankind's most precious possession.
She is perfect.
Perfect.
More dignified.
Hey, lady... wake up.
I shouldn't have done that.
It was wrong to kiss you.
He said to wake you gently.
You're right.
Just thought you might remember me from the cab.
Remember?
"Bada boom?"
"Big bada boom?"
Boom. Big bada boom.
In the cab. Look.
I drive a cab.
This is me.
Korben Dallas.
Korben.
You understand?
Here.
Take it.
You can call me when you learn English.
Just kidding.
What is your name?
You.
Korben.
Leeloo Minai Lekarariba-Laminai-Tchai
Ekbat De Sebat.
Good.
All that's your name?
Do you have... a shorter name?
Short.
Korben Dallas.
Leeloo.
Leeloo.
Korben, Leeloo.
Leeloo, Korben.
You're sure she's a Supreme Being?
Absolutely sure.
Old friends.
Yeah, you're right.
- Ask her for my gun back.
- What's your name?
Korben Dallas.
Thank you for your help.
You've been kind, but now the girl needs to rest.
She's been on a long trip.
I know.
I was there when she landed.
Wait, wait, Father.
She said something
I didn't understand.
What does
"ekto gamat" mean?
"Never without my permission."
That's what I thought.
I shouldn't have kissed her.
Oh, no. I'm so sorry.
I forgot your food.
How about some nice Thai food?
Yeah, yeah, hold on.
Buddy, I'm waiting
all day here.
- Finger.
- Where's the cab?
Car's running fine.
Fine. What "fine"?
I know you.
"Fine"ain't in your vocabulary.
You can tell your old buddy Finger
what happened.
What? You save the planet?
You dinged the fender again.
That's it, right?
I was on my way to see you, and a fare fell in my lap.
One of these big fares you can't resist.
How big?
Five-nine... blue eyes... long legs, great skin.
You know?
Perfect.
I see.
And this perfect fare,
she got a name?
Leeloo.
What's she doing?
Learning our history, the last 5,000 years that she missed.
She's been asleep for a while.
I know she's been through a lot, but we don't have much time.
You're right.
Chicken.
Good.
Chicken.
I'm really sorry to interrupt you, but... the case... with the stones... where is it?
Stolen?
Who in God's name would do such a thing?
Excuse me, sir.
The council is worried about the economy heating up.
Is it possible to fire 500,000?
I thought from a smaller company, like one of the cab companies.
Fire one million.
But 500,000...
One million.
Fine, sir.
Sorry to have disturbed you.
It's for the Supreme...
Sorry.
I didn't know your size, and I found you this makeup box.
You just put it like that.
Yes, there was a man with a limp... came here a month ago asking about the stones.
Said he was an art dealer.
What was his name?
I'm bad with names.
- They really make her...
- Perfect, I know.
What'd she say?
She says she knows
exactly where they are.
My dear Aknot, how about those two planes you borrowed?
Aknot, is that you?
What an ugly face.
It doesn't suit you.
Take it off.
That's better.
Never be ashamed of who you are.
You're warriors.
Be proud.
So what if the federal government scattered you to the wind.
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.
Your time for revenge is at hand.
The ZF-1.
It's light. The handle's adjustable for easy carrying.
Breaks down into four parts, undetectable by X-ray. Discreet.
A word on fire power:
Titanium recharger, 3,000-round clip, with bursts of 3 to 300.
With the replay button, a Zorg invention, it's even easier.
One shot... and replay sends every following shot to the same location.
And to finish the job, all the Zorg oldies but goldies.
Rocket launcher.
Arrow launcher... with exploding or poisonous heads.
Very practical.
Net launcher.
The flamethrower.
My favorite.
And for the grand finale... the new Ice Cube System.
Four full crates... delivered right on time.
And what about you, dear Aknot?
Did you bring what I asked?
Yes.
Magnificent.
This...
This case is empty.
Empty?
Empty... the opposite of full.
This case is supposed to be full!
Anyone care to explain?
The Guardians gave the stones to someone they could trust.
Who took another route.
She's supposed to contact this person... in a hotel.
And she's looking for the address.
Easy.
Dot.
It's Planet Fhloston, in the Angel Constellation.
We're saved.
I'm screwed.
You asked for a case.
We brought one.
A case with four stones in it!
Not one or two or three, but four!
Four stones!
But what the hell am I supposed to do with an empty case?
We are warriors, not merchants.
But you can still count!
Look at my fingers.
Four stones, four crates.
Zero stones, zero crates!
Pack everything up!
We're out of here!
We risked our lives.
I believe a little compensation is in order.
So you are merchants after all.
Leave him one crate for the cause.
I don't like warriors.
Narrow-minded, no subtlety... and they fight for hopeless causes, honor.
Honor's killed millions of people.
Hasn't saved a single one.
I'll tell you what I do like:
A killer.
A dyed-in-the-wool killer, cold-blooded, clean and methodical.
A real killer picking up the ZF-1... would've asked about the red button on the bottom of the gun.
Bring me the priest.
I got everything we need to know about Fhloston Paradise... and a blueprint of the hotel.
Good work, my son.
Now to find a way there.
It won't be easy.
There's a charity ball tomorrow.
Flights are full, and the hotel will be guarded.
There must be a way.
I'll get it.
Weddings?
Not really.
- Mr. Zorg would like to talk to you.
- Who?
Mr. Zorg.
Jean-Baptiste...
Emmanuel...
Zorg.
It's nice to see you again, Father.
I remember you now.
The so-called art dealer.
I'm glad you got your memory back.
Because you'll need it.
Where are the stones?
I don't know.
If I did, I wouldn't tell someone like you.
Why?
What's wrong with me?
I try to serve life.
But you only... want to destroy it.
Father... you're so wrong.
Let me explain.
Life, which you so nobly serve, comes from destruction and chaos.
Take this empty glass.
Here it is, peaceful... boring.
But if it is... destroyed.
Look at all these little things.
So busy now.
Notice how each is useful.
What a lovely ballet ensues... so full of form and color.
Now think of all those people that created them.
Technicians, engineers. People who can feed their children tonight... so those children can grow up and have children... and so on.
Thus adding to the great chain... of life.
Water. Fruit.
You see, Father, by creating a little destruction...
I'm encouraging life.
In reality, you and I are in the same business.
Cheers.
Where's the robot to pat you on the back?
Or the engineer?
Or their children, maybe?
There, you see how all your so-called power counts for nothing?
How your entire empire of destruction comes... crashing down... all because of one, little... cherry.
You saved my life... and in return,
I'll spare yours... for now.
You're a monster, Zorg.
I know.
Torture who you have to, the President, I don't care.
Just bring me the stones.
You have one hour.
It's gobbling up all the satellites in the galaxy.
Why is it eating up all the satellites?
We're working on it.
The Mondoshawan deplore the incident but accept our apologies.
And the stones?
Did you find them?
They weren't on board.
What?
The Mondoshawan never fully trusted the human race.
They gave them to someone they do trust.
Her name is Plavalaguna.
She's a diva.
She's singing at a charity ball in Fhloston Paradise.
She has the stones.
The Mondoshawans will help.
We must send someone...
to get the stones.
Excellent.
I want this operation to be as discreet as possible.
No troops.
No big operation.
I want your best man to go undercover.
I have the perfect one.
You've got a message.
Not opening it?
Could be important.
Like the last two were important.
First one was from my wife telling me she's leaving.
The second was from my lawyer telling me he was leaving with my wife.
That is bad luck.
Grandfather say...
"It never rain everyday."
This is good news, guaranteed.
I bet you lunch.
Okay.
Come on.
"You are fired."
Oh, I'm sorry.
At least I won lunch.
Good philosophy.
See good in bad.
I like.
- Hello.
- Korben, sweetheart.
You got broken fingers?
You can't punch my number?
Hi, Mom.
Seventeen messages.
Don't say your machine is broken again.
They last 1,000 years.
Mr. Kim, you should go.
This'll take a minute.
You don't feed your cat a croquette,
who you love more than me.
She didn't breast-feed you.
I did.
Good fortune for you.
You don't have a girl.
I'll never be a grandmother.
It bring you good luck!
My body's failing.
Take me on this trip.
What are you talking about?
You want to make me beg?
No, all I want is an explanation.
I just got in.
I just smashed my cab.
I lost my job. I got mugged.
Besides that, everything's peachy.
Thanks for asking.
Now settle down and explain this to me.
You don't know
you won a trip...
to Fhloston Paradise for two
for ten days?
I suppose you'll just leave me
on the lunar surface?
If I'd won a trip,
I'd know.
I would've been notified.
They've been blaring your name out
on the radio for an hour.
I'll call you back.
General, how nice to see you in the 5000 block.
Nice apartment.
You've settled into a wonderful life.
Heard you lost your job.
You heard that?
Don't worry.
I'll get another job.
Don't bother.
We have one for you.
"Major Dallas... you've been selected for a mission."
- What mission?
- To save the world.
"You leave for Fhloston Paradise.
Get four stones from the diva
Plavalaguna and bring them back."
Any questions?
Why me? I retired six months ago. Remember?
Three reasons.
One:
As a member of the Elite Special Forces Unit... you are an expert in the use of all necessary weapons and spacecraft.
Two: You're the most highly decorated member of your unit.
The third?
Of all the members of your unit, you're the only one left alive.
Check your messages?
I've had enough good news.
Might be important.
You're a winner!
You've won the Gemini Contest and a trip to Fhloston Paradise for two.
Here are your tickets.
You rigged the contest?
Congratulations.
You couldn't be more discreet?
Old tricks are the best tricks.
Major Iceborg will accompany you as your wife.
I am not going.
Why not?
Excuse me, General.
Who is it?
Who is it?
My wife.
You remarried?
Yes... no. I just met this girl, but I'm going to marry her.
I love her, but she hates the military.
She knows the military ruined my last marriage.
She can't have anything to do with it.
If she sees you, she'll kill me.
- Major...
- You gotta hide somewhere.
You've gotta help me.
We'd love to, but where can we hide?
We don't have time for this.
It's just for one minute.
You have no idea how much you're helping me.
No idea...
You have no idea.
- I'm going to be happily married.
- Major! Major!
- The three of us won't fit.
- Sure you will.
Major!
You're on my foot.
Major! Major!
I'm really sorry to resort to this,
Mr. Wallace...
Dallas.
We heard about your good luck and need your tickets for Fhloston.
Is this the way priests vacation?
We're on a mission.
What kind?
We have to save the world, my son.
You're gonna save the world?
Yes!
Down there.
Down there.
This is a police control.
This is not an exercise.
Come on, get in.
For one minute, all right?
Just stay here for one minute.
- This is a police control.
- Don't touch anything.
This is not an exercise.
Can you please spread your legs...
and place your hands
in the yellow circles.
- What are you doing?
- Saving you so you can save the world.
Yeah, but I...
I think this is the door.
No name, no number.
Let's see it.
Are you classified
as human?
Negative.
I am a meat Popsicle.
I found him.
Mr. Korben Dallas?
Sir, can you put your hands in the yellow circles, please?
Smoke you!
Wrong answer.
The police control
is now terminated.
Thank you for your cooperation.
Have a nice day.
We got the guy.
Wasn't easy but we bagged him.
- Thanks for the tip.
- Glad to be of help, my friend.
The guy's been arrested for uranium smuggling.
All I have to do now is go to the airport, take his place... and I'll be in Fhloston in four hours.
Don't come back without the stones.
We got Korben Dallas.
Perfect.
Akanit, take command.
Go to Fhloston and get the stones.
If Zorg really wants them... he'll have to negotiate.
Revenge is at hand.
Oh, I am so sorry.
I forgot about the autowash.
There's an autowash in that shower.
I'm so sorry.
Autowash.
Autowash, yes.
Autowash, in the shower.
It's funny.
I've met you twice today.
Both times you've ended up in my arms.
It's my lucky day.
Lucky day.
Did you hear something?
Cornelius.
Autowash.
- I'm so sorry.
- I don't need your help.
- Want a cup of coffee?
- Yes, please.
Autowash.
Coffee's not my specialty.
But you must drink a lot of coffee being a priest.
I know. I'm not proud of what I did.
I had no choice.
I'll take the mission.
- Did you get them?
- Yeah.
Good.
- "Leeloo Dallas."
- "Multi-pass."
"Korben David Dallas."
Perfect.
I can't be your husband.
I'm too old.
Now David is... in great shape.
He'll protect you.
Now, please, go to the Diva, collect the stones and meet me at the temple.
Now. Yes.
Okay.
Last call for Fhloston Paradise.
Hurry.
The tickets.
- I.D., please.
- I'm sorry.
- There.
- In here?
Mr. Dallas?
Congratulations on the contest.
Oh, right. Okay.
- Sorry for the mess.
- The mess?
The garbage.
Made it!
I was afraid
I wouldn't make it... so I sent David to pick up my boarding pass.
Now David must go.
Thank you. Bye.
I am Korben Dallas.
Please report infractions
immediately to the spaceport.
And this is?
Leeloo Dallas.
Multi-pass.
Multi-pass.
She knows it's a multi-pass.
My wife.
We're newlyweds. Just met.
Bump into each other, sparks happen...
She knows.
Anyway, we're in love.
I mean, I know she's made to be strong.
She's also so fragile, so human.
You know what I mean?
- You want more?
- Yeah.
Make that two.
- Where's Leeloo?
- On the plane with Mr. Dallas.
What!
I didn't know what to do.
But this is not possible.
This is not possible.
You want some more?
This is all my fault.
It is my mission.
I shouldn't have given it to you.
I know.
- The key to the temple.
- Oh, no.
Prepare for our arrival.
I go to face my destiny.
I don't want to go to Egypt.
Dallas?
Korben Dallas?
That's me.
Just a minute, please.
It will just take one more minute.
We'll be right back.
Mr. Dallas... we really need you now.
Ruby Rhod is broadcasting live and needs to interview you.
Multi-pass.
Tell Aknot that plan A flopped.
Go to plan B.
Aliens ahead.
Spread out.
Backup unit, zone 18.
Ruby Rhod is the biggest radio star.
It's an honor to be on his talk show.
He's so green.
I'm sure you're excited.
I'm on vacation and don't want to be bothered.
I prefer to remain anonymous.
Korben Dallas!
Here he is! The winner of the Gemini Croquette Contest.
This boy is fuelled like fire, so start melting, ladies...
'cause he is hotter than hot.
He's hot, hot, hot!
The right size, the right build, the right hair, the right on.
Right on.
And he's got something to say... to those 50 billion pairs of ears out there.
Pop it, D-man.
Hi.
Unbelievable.
Quiver, ladies.
He's going to set the world on fire.
Right here from five to seven.
You'll know everything there is to know about the D-man.
His dreams... his desires... his most intimates of intimates.
And from what I'm looking at, intimate is his middle name.
So tell me, my man... you nervous in the service?
Not really.
Freeze those knees 'cause Korben's in the place and he's on the case.
Yesterday's frog will be tomorrow's Prince... of Fhloston Paradise!
The hotel of a thousand and one follies and lollies.
A magic fountain flowing with nonstop wine, women and... hootchie-kootchie-koo... all night long.
All night long
All night
Start licking stamps, girls, because he'll have you writing home to Mama.
Here from five to seven,
I'll be your voice, your tongue.
On the trail of the sexiest man of the year: D-man, your man... my man.
End of transmission.
See you tomorrow at five.
How was it?
It was just absolutely green.
Green like what?
Crystal green.
Any kind of green you want... tree green, emerald, pond green.
Korben, sweetheart, what was that?
It was bad! It had nothing!
No fire! No energy!
I have a show to run here.
It must pop, pop, pop!
So tomorrow, from five to seven... please act like you have more than a two-word vocabulary.
It must be green!
Okay? Okay?
Can I talk to you for a second?
Just talk to you?
I didn't come here to play
Pumba on the radio.
Tomorrow, from five to seven, you'll give yourself a hand.
Green?
Super green.
Dallas? Korben Dallas?
That's me.
I only have one Korben Dallas on my list, and he's checked in.
That's impossible.
I am Korben Dallas.
Sorry, sir.
Boarding is finished.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
I need to talk to someone!
I don't believe this!
This is not an exercise.
This is a police control.
I'm sorry. I'm calm.
There's been a mistake.
There's been a mistake.
To make your flight short... flight attendants are switching on the sleep regulator... which will regulate your sleeping during the flight.
Thank you.
Hi.
- You speak English.
- Yes. I learn.
Good.
We are not on vacation.
I'm on an important mission.
I work for some important people.
If I hadn't come to get you, you'd be in trouble.
Understand?
Yes.
But you, no trouble.
Me, Fifth Element.
Supreme Being.
Me protect you.
Sleep.
Sweet dreams,
Mr. Dallas.
Sleep regulator operative in zone one.
Thank you.
Are you operative?
Zone two?
Everything's ready, Captain.
What?
Assume your individual position.
But I want all positions!
Mr. Rhod...
Parasites in landing gear.
Ground, copy?
Got it.
Front gear.
Hey, man, give me some heat, man!
We need some heat here!
Get some heat!
Some heat over here, man!
Good shit, man.
Put the heat over here!
Thank you!
Thank you very much!
Come, come.
Give me this. Give me this.
Take that.
Mr. Rhod!
You can call me Ruby.
Fueled and ready to go.
I'll buy you one.
Taken off already?
I'm not on the plane.
What?
The real Dallas took my place.
I don't understand.
Are you making fun of me?
No, no, no!
I swear! I swear!
I never felt this way before with a human.
Really?
I've tried everything.
There's no way to get on the plane.
Ground is clear.
Ready for liftoff?
Confirmed.
Not there. No, please, not there.
Please, not there.
- Power pressure?
- Primed.
- Protection?
- Confirmed
Power increase.
Ten seconds.
I am... a little... disappointed.
If there is one thing
I do not like... it is to be... disappointed.
Sorry, it will never happen again.
I know.
Liftoff.
- Landing gear secure.
- Checklist for light speed.
We're finally getting something.
It's sending radio wavelengths.
What does it want with radio waves?
Maybe it wants to make a call.
Zorg's office.
I told you I did not want to be disturbed.
You don't want to be disturbed except if it's Mr. Shadow... and Mr. Shadow's on the line.
It's Shadow again.
Zorg here.
Am I disturbing you?
No, no, I was just...
Where are you?
Not far now.
Good.
Good, good.
How are the stones?
Fine. Fine.
Just fine.
I'll have the four stones you asked for any time now... but it wasn't easy.
My costs have tripled.
Money is of no...
importance.
I...
want...
the stones.
The stones... will be here.
I'll see to it personally.
I will be among you...
soon.
We lost it.
We lost the signal.
Damn!
We've begun our descent
toward Fhloston Paradise.
The local time
is 3:20 p.m.
Auto-temperature is currently
85 degrees Fahrenheit.
We hope you enjoyed your flight
and hope to see you again soon.
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to paradise.
Excuse me, dear. Excuse me.
Excuse me, please.
Parasites in the main ventilation.
Again?
I'll get it.
Have we arrived yet?
Oh, good.
We have twelve swimming pools and two on the rooftop.
All the restaurants are between levels two and ten.
The planet Fhloston has 400 beaches, all accessible until 5 p. M... then the airship goes higher... to offer you a better view.
Is the Diva here?
Not yet.
Any tickets left for the opera?
You have a seat reserved, front row... next to Ruby Rhod!
He's so talented.
I love him. He's so sexy.
He has your ticket, and he'll be here in 20 minutes.
Where can I get something to wear?
- Enjoy your evening, Mr. Dallas.
- Thank you.
You miserable bastard,
I never should've pushed you out.
I was in labor for days,
and this is how you repay me?
I should've gotten
a robot.
Come on, Ma.
I should be there, not you.
I need a tan.
I need a cocktail.
Get the case in.
Hello, Ms. Diva.
I'm Fog.
Welcome to the...
I'm security.
Welcome to the...
Tall.
- Can I talk to you?
- Sure. Yeah.
- What's your name?
- Fog.
Ms. Plavalaguna is glad that you are here.
She'll give you what you've come to get after the concert.
Stay here.
You're listening to Radio Cosmos.
It is 5 p.m.
Helm to 108.
Helm 108!
Helm to 108.
Time to join Ruby Rhod...
and Korben Dallas,
the lucky winner...
of the Gemini Croquette contest.
Coming at you live
from Fhloston...
Paradise!
Ruby Rhod at your service with Korben and the manager of this hotel... and Miss Gemini Croquette in person... and 8,000 other lucksters here... to enjoy the privilege of the unique concert of Miss Plavalaguna!
Now we enter what must be... the most beautiful concert hall of all the universe!
A perfect replica of an old opera house... but who cares?
To my right, a row of ministers, more sinisters than ministers.
To my left, Baby Ray, star of stage and screen.
He's not going to get much out of this concert. He's stone-deaf!
To who?
And here we have Roy Von Baker, king of laser ball.
The Emperor of KodarJaphet and his lovely daughter.
"I love to sing," she recently confessed to me.
By the way, I have a recording of her talented voice.
I'll play the rest after the concert.
Now it's time... for Korben to say the word of the day.
Tell me, my man, you happy here in the big world?
Thrilled.
And now... champagne!
Commercial!
Commercial!
Break for 30 seconds.
Show time.
I have a ship in trouble requesting permission to dock.
Put him in the docking garage.
Inform security.
- Permission granted for one hour.
- More than I need.
Champagne for the Diva.
I'll take it.
I found it.
Get her!
It was an ambush.
If it's war they want... it's war they'll get!
Bravo! Bravo!
Bravo! Bravo!
My compliments, little lady.
Thank you for doing the dirty work.
I couldn't have done a better job myself.
Hand over the stones.
Nobody move!
I'm taking over the ship!
Hands up!
I know this music.
Let's change the beat.
I think we're being attacked.
They're everywhere.
I see one of them.
They're warriors, and they're ugly.
They got big teeth, and they got
big foreheads, and they stink.
Mangalores.
The government sent me to help you.
If somebody hears this, come and get me.
I'm in the first row.
You must give her the stones.
Who?
The Fifth Element.
The Supreme Being sent to Earth to save the universe.
Leeloo?
But she's more fragile than she seems.
She needs your help... and your love... or... she will die.
Stay with me.
Help!
If you want something done... do it yourself.
Come on, honey.
You can't die.
Wake up!
Where are the stones?
Where are the stones?
The stones.
They're not here.
The stones, where are they?
In me.
What?
Oh, my God, Korben.
Korben, another one coming.
- I think we should go.
- One minute. One minute.
Hey, you!
I said you.
- I'm not with him.
- Where's the other?
I said, "one minute."
Ruby, hold this gun.
What do you want me to do?
Come on.
Put your hand on it.
- What do I do?
- If he moves, squeeze the trigger.
I don't feel right.
- I don't feel right.
- The stones are "in me."
I got a headache.
This ain't me.
Sorry.
Think he'll be okay?
Oh, my God, Korben.
Another one coming.
Shit. Three coming.
You guard this with your life... or you'll look like him.
You green?
Green.
Super green?
Is that your idea of a discreet operation?
Don't worry. I know my man.
He'll calm things down.
Move! Move!
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Ladies and gentlemen... this is amazing.
Let me do it.
Oh, my God.
Korben Dallas, my man, is in trouble.
The gun!
Give me the gun.
I'm going to go... and try to see if I can see something a little closer.
Yes, the gun. Yeah.
Thanks, Ray.
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
I'm not armed!
Get up!
You've got the wrong guy!
Don't shoot!
I'm not armed.
Oh, my God.
I'm on vacation.
Don't shoot me, please.
I'm on a vacation.
I won a... contest.
Gemini Croquette's to...
Fhloston Paradise.
Down.
Wait a minute.
Get down!
He's trying to say something.
Down!
Sorry, my man.
Where are you?
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
They're coming.
They're coming.
Don't move.
What you doing?
Count to ten.
- Was that a bomb?
- Shut up and count!
I am... very disappointed.
Korben, what are you looking for?
Control room.
- This is it.
- I'll be here.
Let's go.
Quiet! Quiet!
You in charge?
How many are out there?
- I don't know.
- Let's count.
Seven on the left.
Five on the right.
Four on the right.
Two on the left.
Find the leader.
They won't fight without the leader.
One more shot and we start killing hostages.
That's the leader.
Send someone to negotiate.
I've never negotiated.
You mind if I try?
We're sending somebody to negotiate.
Anybody else want to negotiate?
Where did he learn to negotiate like that?
I wonder.
Where's Ruby?
I thought he was dead.
Master!
It was nothing, really.
Just a helping hand.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is Ruby Rhod... still alive.
What's wrong with you?
It hurt!
I realize that you must be pretty mad at me... but I'm fighting for a noble cause.
Yes, you're trying to save the world.
I remember.
Right now,
I'm trying to save Leeloo.
Leeloo's in trouble?
When is Leeloo not in trouble?
- Where's that?
- The Diva's suite.
Hang on.
Here, come on.
How do you get yourself into these positions?
Come on.
I'm here. It's all right.
Everything's okay now.
Listen.
I got the stones.
Just take it easy, all right?
My man, my man, what's this thing with all these numbers?
If it was a bomb... the alarms would go off because all these hotels have bomb detectors.
This is a type "A"alert.
For security reasons,
the hotel must be evacuated.
Proceed calmly
to the lifeboats...
Stay calm!
... located in the main hallways.
Stay calm!
You know how to stop this, right?
Two minutes
to complete evacuation.
Get back!
Evacuation!
Evacuation!
Sorry, you can't stay here.
There's a bomb in the hotel.
I know.
I don't want to die.
Please, my son.
Get in.
One minute to total evacuation.
This one.
45 seconds.
Get her strapped in.
You know how to fly this?
Like driving a cab.
How will we get out the door?
15 seconds.
10...
9, 8...
6...
5.
For the honor.
Hold on.
Like driving a cab.
It is now 7 p.m., time for the news.
See you tomorrow for a new adventure.
End of transmission.
That's the best show
I ever did.
Major Dallas has the five elements on board... and the priest is guiding them to the temple.
We're saved.
The Diva said
I should take care of you.
Humans act so strange.
What do you mean?
Everything you created... is used to destroy.
We call it human nature.
You learn that on your screen?
I'm not finished yet.
I'm up to "V."
"V" is good.
Some good words in "V."
Like what?
"Valiant."
"Vulnerable."
"Very beautiful."
Oh, of course, Munro!
Mr. President?
Now what?
We have a problem.
It's advancing?
It's not only advancing, it's moving at incredible speed.
And do you have any idea where it's heading?
Korben, there's a general on the phone.
I'll give you the President.
Major Dallas, I first would like to salute a warrior.
You're a shining example
of this army.
In the name
of the Federation...
Any idea when you'll get to the point?
A ball of fire 1,200 miles in diameter heading straight for earth...
and we have no idea how to stop it.
That's the problem.
How much time do we have?
If its speed remains constant, in an hour and 57 minutes.
I'll call you back in two hours.
Hello?
They just landed in the desert.
Good job, David.
- Put her in the center.
- Where? Here?
You got it figured out, Father?
This one should be fire.
- You know how this works?
- Theoretically.
The four stones should go around.
The Fifth Element should be in the middle... and then the weapon against evil should work.
You've never seen this work?
Give me that.
Every weapon has a manual.
I'm sure this has one too.
That's it.
That's it.
Match up the symbols.
Go! Go!
Wind.
My man, what you doing?
- What?
- What you doing?
Trying to keep you in the D.J. Business.
Fire.
Done.
What happens?
So, now, we have to open them.
And you know how to do that.
Right?
Theoretically...
No.
Leeloo, honey, wake up.
You have to help us.
How do you open the stones?
Wind blows.
Fire burns.
Yes, I know all that.
But how do you open these stones?
Rain... falls.
What does it mean?
I think that...
Maybe it's a charade.
A game or something.
If we don't get these stones open in five minutes, we're dead.
- Dead?
- Yes, dead.
Too late.
We've lost contact with them.
Three minutes.
I think mine is broken.
Why I gotta get the broke one?
We're never gonna make it.
It moved.
- Show me what you did.
- Nothing.
Shut up, shut up!
Show me what you did, step-by-step.
- I was standing here.
- Quickly.
I put my hands on the top like this, and I said...
"We're not going to make it."
And that's it?
Korben, my man.
Wind.
She said, "Wind blows."
Everyone take a stone.
Water for water. Fire for fire.
Earth for Earth. Go!
Earth.
Open the other one.
Korben, my man,
I have no fire.
I have no matches.
Do you have any?
I stopped smoking.
Father, you smoke?
Got some matches?
We need some fire.
We're going to die.
Don't breathe.
Fire.
One minute.
Let's go, Leeloo.
Wake up. Wake up.
It's time for you to work now.
Protect life... until death.
Listen to me!
Listen to me.
Listen,
I know you're very tired.
I'll take you on vacation.
A real vacation, just you and me.
But if you don't do something right now... we'll all die.
What's the use of saving life when you see what you do with it?
It'll enter the atmosphere in 40 seconds.
You're right.
You're right.
There are some things... very nice things worth saving; beautiful things.
Beautiful things.
Like love?
Yes, love.
That's good. That's good.
That's a good example.
Love is worth saving.
I don't know love.
I don't know love.
I was built to protect, not love.
So there's no use for me other than this.
You're wrong.
You're wrong. You're wrong.
I need you.
I need you, very much.
Why?
Because... because...
Tell her, Korben.
Tell me.
Please.
Why you need me?
Because...
Tell me.
- Tell me.
- Because I...
Because I love you.
I love you.
2...
Scanner imaging has confirmed
the dark planet dead.
The planet seems to have stopped at 62 miles from impact.
What's wrong?
What you screaming for?
Every five minutes it's a bomb or something.
I'm leaving.
Mr. President.
Let me introduce Professor Mactilburgh who runs the center.
It's an honor, Mr. President.
Where are my two heroes?
They were so tired from their ordeal, we put them in the reactor.
I have 19 meetings after this.
Let me see if they're revived.
Thank you.
We go live in one minute.
They're... not ready.
They need... five more minutes.
You have 20 seconds.
No, ma'am, I tried.
No, ma'am.
Who's that?
Some woman.
Claims to be Korben's mother.
Give it here.
Mrs. Dallas, this is the President.
On behalf of the Federation...
That doesn't
even sound like him.
The President's an idiot.
You don't sound like an idiot.
If you don't want to talk
to your mother...
just avoid me as usual.

Professor!
Catherine.
Watch your step. OK.
- We have found something beautiful!
I don't believe it. Big, big surprise!
- Yeah? I can hardly wait.
Over here!
Dr. Langford.
- Hello.
What have we here?
Cover stones.
It's fantastic.
Catherina, come!
What in God's name is that?
- I wish I knew.
...there are symbols everywhere.
Names, titles of owners, offerings.
Every other major structure at the time was covered in hieroglyphics.
When is the academic community going to accept that the pharaohs of the 4th Dynasty did not build the Great Pyramid?
Inside the pyramid, the most incredible structure ever erected, there are no writings whatsoever.
- Dr. Jackson, you left out that Colonel Vyse discovered quarrymen's inscriptions of Khufu's name within the pyramid.
His discovery was a fraud.
Well, I hope you can prove it.
Who do you think built the pyramids?
I don't have any idea who built them.
Men from Atlantis?
Or Martians perhaps?
The point is not who built them, it is when they were built.
I mean we all know, new geological evidence dates the Sphinx back to a much earlier period. Knowing this, we ought to re-evaluate everything we've come to accept about...
I've been able to show a fully developed writing system appeared in the 1st two dynasties.
Almost as if it was based on an even earlier prototype.
Is there a lunch or something, that everybody...?
Dr. Jackson!
- What? Yes?
Someone wants to speak with you.
The Air Force? What is this?
- Could you step over to the car?
We goin' somewhere?
- You're gonna be fine.
We'll take care of these.
Those your parents?
Foster parents.
What is this all about?
A job.
What kind of a job?
Translation.
Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics.
Interested?
I'm gonna go now.
Go where?
You've just been evicted.
Your grants have run out.
Everything you own is in those two bags.
You want to prove that your theories are right?
This is your chance.
What's this?
Travel plans.
Mrs. O'Neil?
Come on in.
Mrs. O'Neil, is your husband home?
Yes.
Could we speak with him?
You can try.
Excuse me, Colonel O'Neill, we're from General West's office.
We're here to inform you that you've been reactivated.
That guy's a mess.
How'd he get like that? - His kid accidentally shot himself. - Jesus.
Cleared.
Cold?
Allergies.
Always happens when I travel.
There you go.
Dr. Jackson, Dr. Gary Meyers.
- Hello. - How are you?
What is this place?
- Nuclear missile silo.
Now don't worry, it's been completely converted. Barbara Shore.
OK, Jackson, welcome to the well.
- Hello.
Where did you find this?
- Giza Plateau, 1928.
I've never seen anything like this.
- Of course you haven't.
No one has.
- There's two lines of hieroglyphics.
The inner track has the classic figures.
But the outer is like the cartouche in the center.
We've never found this writing before.
- Those aren't hieroglyphics.
It might be some kind of hieratic or cuneiform.
The translation of the inner track is wrong.
Must have used Budge.
Don't know why anyone would.
What are you doing?
We've used every known technique.
That's funny, "Gebeh," eh?
Yeah.
- Then an adverbial, "sedjem-en-ef."
Then "sealed and... buried."
Excuse me, what are you doing?
It's not "coffin."
It's "for all time."
Who the hell did this?
I... I did.
This should be "A million years into the sky is Ra, Sun God, sealed and buried for all time."
It's not "door to heaven," it is...
"Stargate."
So why is the military interested in 5,000 year-old tablets?
My report says ten thousand.
Afternoon, Colonel.
Do I know you? - Colonel Jack O'Neil, from General West's office.
I'll be taking over from now on.
10,000 is ludicrous. Egyptian culture didn't even exist until...
We know, but radiocarbon tests are conclusive. - Was there a tomb?
No, but something a lot more interesting. - Excuse me.
This information has become classified.
No information is to be passed on to civilians without my express permission.
What's going on?
- I'm not sure.
Colonel O'Neil.
You owe me an explanation.
I was told I had complete autonomy.
Plans change.
Why are you here?
Why did they bring you on this project?
I'm here in case you succeed.
TWO WEEKS LATER
No matches whatsoever with cuneiform and other pre-dynastic hieroglyphics.
I've exhausted all references comparing the cartouche symbols against all known writings from the period.
Still no similarities.
I'm never gonna get paid.
Can I borrow this?
Orion.
Right here, Daniel.
- Jackson, this is General West.
- Oh, right, General.
So you think you've solved in 14 days what they couldn't solve in 2 years?
Any time.
I have some stuff to look at.
If you'll just pass 'em down.
You'll have to share.
I don't have enough.
Anyway...
Here is a picture of the cover stones.
The symbols on the outer track that you thought were words, were, in fact, star constellations.
These were placed in an order, forming a map or address of sorts.
Seven points to outline a course to a position.
To find the destination within any three-dimensional space we need six points to determine an exact location.
You said you needed seven points.
Well no, six for the destination.
But to chart a course you need a point of origin.
Except there's only six on the cartouche.
The 7th isn't actually inside the cartouche. It's just below, designated by... a little pyramid with... two... funny... neat little guys and a funny line coming out of the top.
Anyway, uh...
He did it.
No.
That symbol isn't on the device.
What device?
Show him.
What is that?
It's your "Stargate."
Come, Jackson.
Monitors up!
- Monitors are up.
Mitch, bring up the details on the center monitor, please?
I've got details on.
Hold it.
Wait a minute.
You have a, uh...
...here. Sorry.
Hey, don't!
- Two figures... on either side, praying beside a pyramid with the sun directly above it.
He's right.
It was in front of us the whole time.
General West,
Jackson has identified the 7th symbol.
Go ahead. - Programming
7th symbol into computer.
Chevron 1 is holding.
Chevron 1 in place.
Power output at 23 percent.
Chevron 2 is holding.
Engaged. - Chevron 2 locked in place.
- We're at 35 percent.
Condition red in the gate.
Evacuate all personnel.
Area secure.
Heading back. Seal the door.
This was under the cover stones?
- Yes. My father found it. 1928.
Made out of a mineral unlike any found on Earth.
Chevron 5 lock in place.
79 percent.
Chevron 6 is holding.
Chevron 6 is locked in place.
This is as far as we've ever been able to get.
The breakers aren't holding.
Override manually.
Chevron 7 is locked in place.
Send in the probe.
Let's go!
Yes, sir.
Record all information from the gate.
Clear inner silo for approach.
- Everybody outta here. - Let's go!
It's guiding itself.
Can you believe that?
The beam has locked itself onto a point somewhere in the Kaliam galaxy.
It has mass. It could be a moon or a large asteroid.
Where are we on that?
The blue dot.
That's right, Jackson.
It's on the other side of the known universe.
We're losing the signal.
This is what the probe sent us.
Freeze and enhance.
You can clearly see the gate on the other side.
The gates must have functioned as a doorway between our worlds.
These readings say it's an atmospheric match.
Pressure, temperature, and... most importantly, oxygen.
These markings are different.
They don't match our gate.
- That's why we may have to abort.
This project is for naught without a reconnaissance mission.
Once there we would have to decipher the markings on their gate and, in essence, dial home, to bring the team back.
Based on this new information,
I don't see how we can do that.
Well, I could do that.
Are you sure?
Positive.
Your call.
You're on the team.
You understand, this complicates things.
That's why I wanted you, Jack.
We've opened a door to a world we know nothing about.
I have something for you.
No, I...
- Yes.
I found it with the Stargate when I was a child.
It has brought me luck.
You can bring it back to me.
Back-up storage.
Reserve power, on.
We're secure. Clear the area.
- Move it, let's go.
Surveillance and monitoring.
...equipment, reserve power...
If anybody has anything to say, now's the time to say it.
Vector tracking set.
Molecular deconstruction in progress.
Jackson, it's alright.
It's over. Stay with him.
Keep moving.
It wears off in a minute.
What a rush!
Prepare to move out.
It's all here, yeah.
Three teams, let's go.
White team, go!
Clear, no contact.
One-two ratio stable.
- Conditions are similar to inside.
I wanna take a look around.
Kawalsky, Feretti.
Move up there, good.
I knew it.
One - three - three - two.
Report.
Our quarter mile perimeter is just about complete, sir.
Wrap this up, everybody back inside!
I want you all back through the Stargate in an hour.
You're coming too, aren't you, Colonel?
Jackson, start working on the Stargate.
What's that all about?
- I don't know Feretti.
I'm gonna need more time.
There's bound to be more structures, or some other traces of civilization.
Not this trip. Just get back in there and re-establish contact.
It's not that easy. This is a replica of the great pyramid of Giza.
We're not gonna find any hieroglyphics or carved relief.
We need to look around more.
Your job is to re-align the Stargate.
Can you do that or not?
No.
You can't, or you won't?
I can decipher the symbols, but I need an order of alignment.
The co-ordinates were on stone tablets back on Earth.
I just need to find something like that here.
What do you mean "find it?"
You didn't say anything about that.
- I assumed they would be here.
You assumed?
You're a lying son of a bitch!
You didn't mention finding anything!
Set up a camp down here.
Organize our supplies.
You've got your orders.
This is hot.
We're stuck here.
- Don't be such a doomsayer.
Yeah, give it a rest.
- Yes, please.
If we don't come back soon, they'll just turn off the other gate.
It doesn't work that way.
If you don't turn it off from here, we're screwed.
So I'm tellin' you guys, we're not goin' anywhere.
This is a nice tent.
Oh, we each get a tent. That's nice.
...the hell is that?
A thermal blanket, don't need that.
I got everything but sun-block.
Shouldn't you be doing something now?
Like getting us outta here!
Foot powder. Great.
That's cold, man.
Base camp is up, sir.
Where's Jackson?
It's OK. No, It's OK.
Good boy!
What do you want?
You want some of this?
I wouldn't feed that thing!
It's got a harness.
It's domesticated!
Let go of it!
Do something!
Come on!
Help me!
You OK, Jackson?
Kawalsky.
- You dropped these. - Brown.
Get away from me.
Easy.
All right, Jackson.
You're on.
Me?
You're the linguist.
Try to talk with 'em.
What did you say to him?
- Nothing.
It's OK.
It's OK. See?
Quartz, primary element.
I can't make it out...
It sounds familiar, a bit like Berber.
Or maybe it's Chadic or Omotic.
Thank you.
What's that mean?
I have no idea.
He's inviting us to come.
How can you be so sure?
Because he's inviting us to go with him.
We were looking for signs of civilization. We've found it.
To get us back home, this is our best shot. - He's right.
I took some readings on what they're mining.
This is the same material as the Stargate.
Radio base camp.
Tell them to keep it secure, until we get back. - Yes, sir.
Base camp, come in.
- Feretti, I've got 'em.
Come on.
Could you repeat that, sir?
...O'Neil says to secure base camp.
Looks like we could be here a while.
OK, sir.
- Understand? - Yes, sir.
What's the story? - We're not going back. This is not good.
The eye of Ra.
It's the Egyptian Sun God.
They think he sent us here.
I wonder why...
Ra.
Where they all going?
Come in.
Feretti!
Sir, I can't make this out.
Feretti, say again.
We have to abandon base camp!
Repeat, we have to abandon base camp!
It's useless. It won't work in this.
Freeman, let's go!
Everybody back inside!
I'll get the ammo.
Get the battery packs!
We're going back right now.
Wait!
Stay here.
What is it, Colonel?
- Sandstorm. Coming this way.
An excellent reason to shoot everyone.
We'll stay until it's over.
Sorry.
We've gotta get back to the pyramid!
Where the hell'd that come from?
Kawalsky, Brown, do you read?
I don't think we should eat.
They might consider that an insult.
Well, we don't want to offend them now, do we, Daniel?
Tastes like chicken.
It's good.
It tastes...
Tastes like chicken.
Good!
You said that was an Egyptian symbol.
- Yeah. The eye of Ra.
Then it might stand to reason that... if they know one Egyptian symbol...
Yes.
What the hell's going on?
It seems like writing is forbidden to them.
What?
They want me to go with them.
Should I stay? I'll go.
I'll be fine.
OK, that's good.
What is that smell?
I think that's good.
My hands are clean. Thank you.
That was very nice.
I smell much better now.
O Christ, I smell like a yak.
Please, no more.
I'm fine.
I'm clean...
I thought you were one of the other cleaning...
No, no, no.
You don't have to do that.
Maybe you should go. OK?
It's OK. Maybe you should go.
It's OK. It's all right.
Let me take care of it.
No, it's me.
Thank you, I'm very happy.
Daniel.
I'm Daniel.
We came... uh
This pyramid.
See, we came from...
We came from the pyramid.
It's OK.
Never mind.
It's OK.
The Earth.
You know the symbol?
You know the symbol?
You've seen the symbol?
Show me.
You show me.
Kawalsky, this is base.
Do you copy?
You're wasting the battery.
Never get anything in this storm.
Wait till it passes. - Yeah, right.
I F it passes.
I was stationed in the Middle East.
I've never seen anything like it.
Yeah, yeah...
- I don't understand.
Why don't we just turn the gate back on ourselves.
How hard can it be?
- Great!
We could turn the thing in the wrong order and end up in outer space.
Do you have any idea how many possible combinations there are?
No. How many?
Shut up.
What the hell is goin' on?
Spread out.
It's OK. It's just a lighter.
See?
Here!
Yeah, it's pretty fabulous.
You're right. It's pretty stupid.
No, you keep it.
It's yours.
No!
It's dangerous!
What is this place?
I'll be damned.
What?
No signal at all?
- Nothing.
More interference?
No.
They're simply not there.
I can't locate Jackson.
I'm lookin' for Jackson.
He wears this jacket.
He's got long hair that come down...
No, no.
He wears glasses, so he can see.
I guess "dweeb" doesn't mean anything to you, does it? Why not?
I'm on Planet X lookin' for a dweeb,
He's got long hair.
It comes over his eyes.
He wears glasses, and he sneezes.
Chicken, chicken!
Chicken man. You got it.
You want this?
I thought you couldn't speak their language.
Huh? Hi... scared me.
It's an ancient Egyptian dialect.
It's evolved independently.
Once you know the vowels...
Just answer my question.
I had to learn how to pronounce it.
It hasn't been spoken for more than a thousand years.
This says,
"A traveler from distant stars escaped from a dying world looking for a way to extend his own life.
His body decaying and weak, he couldn't prevent his death."
Apparently his species was becoming extinct.
So he traveled or searched the galaxies, looking for a way to cheat death.
Look here: He came to a world rich with life where he encountered a primitive race.
Humans.
A species which he could maintain indefinitely.
He realized, within a human body, he had a chance for a new life.
He found a young boy.
As the frightened villagers ran, night became day, curious and without fear, he walked towards the light.
Ra took him and possessed his body, like a parasite, looking for a host.
Inhabiting this human form he appointed himself ruler.
He used the Stargate to bring thousands of people here as workers for the mines.
Just like the one we saw.
This mineral is the building block of his technology. With it he can sustain eternal life.
Something happened on Earth...
A rebellion, and the Stargate was buried there.
Fearful of a rebellion here,
Ra outlawed reading and writing.
He didn't want the people to remember.
Jackson, you better take a look.
That's what we're looking for.
They hoped the gate on Earth could someday be reopened.
I knew they'd have it written down someplace.
Wait a minute.
Where's the 7th symbol?
It must have broken.
It's gotta be here somewhere...
I got it here.
It's worn off.
I can't make it work without it.
All right, that's it. Kawalsky, Brown.
Come on, Jackson.
What the hell is that?
Here. You might need this.
Look out!
Where are we going?
Why are we going to the Stargate?
I can't make it work.
Shoot at anything that comes down.
- What are you doing? - Just cover me.
What is that?
What are you looking for?
- It's gone.
Put it down, Jackson.
You have come here to destroy me.
What is that?
It's a bomb.
That's what you were looking for.
What the hell were you thinking?
What'd you come here for?
Wait! Don't!
No!
No! No!
Colonel, it's me.
You all right?
Where's Jackson?
Sha'uri, what happened here?
Ra punished us.
Why?
What happened to Daniel?
What happened to Daniel?
Son, we should not have helped the strangers.
I was dead?
That is why I chose your race... your bodies, so easy to repair.
You have advanced much... harnessed the power of the atom.
What are you going to do?
You should not have reopened the gate.
Son, I will send your weapon back to your world, with a shipment of our mineral, which will increase your weapon's destructive power a hundredfold.
Why would you do that?
I created your civilization, now I will destroy it.
But before my workers question my authority, you will prove that I am their one God, by killing your companions.
If I refuse?
Then I will destroy you, and all who have seen you.
There can be only one Ra!
Sha'uri, Ra has called an assembly.
An execution.
Skaara, Nabeh, I want you to listen.
We can't let this happen.
I want you to know what Daniel told me, about where our people came from, and why we can no longer live as slaves.
Freeman!
Jackson!
Come on! Kawalsky!
Jackson!
To our victory!
We recovered your weapons.
Here, Colonel.
So, what do you think?
They're not exactly special forces, but they were eager to join up.
Take these guns away, Lieutenant, before they hurt themselves.
You heard me. Send 'em all home.
- There's no place for them to go.
We could use their help right now.
- For what?
To do what?
Why don't you just tell 'em?
Why don't you tell 'em about the bomb?
What's he talking about?
My orders were simple.
If I found any possible danger, blow up the Stargate.
Well, I found some.
Well, your bomb is his now, tomorrow he's sending it to Earth, along with a shipment of that mineral they mine here.
It'll cause an explosion 100 times more powerful than the bomb alone.
I'll intercept it before he sends it through.
Why wasn't I told of this?
- There was no reason to tell you.
You were all gonna go right back through with Daniel.
I was gonna stay behind and blow up the Stargate.
It's the gate on Earth that we have to shut down.
You're right. But since you don't know how to get us back, we don't have that option, do we?
Where are they?
Answer!
We looked everywhere.
Some kids are helping them.
You accepted that no matter what happened, you wouldn't be going home?
Don't you have people who care?
Do you have a family?
I had a family.
No one should ever have to outlive their own child.
I don't wanna die.
Your men and these people here don't wanna die.
Shame you're in such a hurry to.
How could you let them escape?
I will not accept failure!
Why are you laughing?
- Husbands don't do this work.
Husbands?
Married?
Don't be angry. I didn't tell them.
Tell them what?
That you did not want me.
What are you drawing?
The day of our victory.
Connect the moons...
This is the symbol for this planet.
That's it.
The point of origin.
What are you doing?
I've found it!
What?
The 7th symbol.
We're goin' home.
Let's go.
You'll bring disaster to all of us, son.
Father, we will not live as slaves.
Kasuf!
Take a look at your Gods.
Take a good look.
The caravan is approaching.
Send the bomb down to the Stargate.
What's happening up there?
How you doin'?
Damn! Come on, Feretti!
Come on!
Get that door!
Hey, you OK?
Spread out!
Let's go!
We're dead! - Quit talking like that!
- What're we gonna do? - Cover me.
Cover you?
Kawalsky!
Feretti, help me push this thing over.
Send the bomb to Earth now.
I will send it myself.
What are you doing?
- Completing this mission.
We agreed to dismantle the gate on the other side. - And you will.
That's your job now. I stay and make sure this goes off.
You've got seven minutes.
Daniel.
What are you doing?
Jackson!
- Wait for me.
Nabeh!
Got any rounds at all, Feretti?
- All out. - Incoming. - Get down!
Kawalsky, we gotta do something.
Damn.
Stop!
I am no longer amused.
You will die together.
Give my regards to King Tut, asshole.
How much time do we have left?
- 45 seconds.
He's leaving. Turn it off.
- I can't disarm it. - What?
They've got it rigged.
I got an idea.
I always knew you'd get us back.
- Yeah, right. - Later.
Thanks, Daniel.
You sure you wanna do this?
I'm sure.
You gonna be all right?
I'll be all right.
And you?
Yeah.
Yeah, I think so.
Tell Catherine it brought me luck.
I will.
I'll be seein' you around,
Dr. Jackson

{7049}{7100}If it ain't Count fuckin' Dracula.
{7128}{7197}- Give it a rest, Stew.|- Still not talking?
{7201}{7282}You'll like it in there, Doc.|It's your kind of party.
{7405}{7499}Her name's Donna Berman,|a student at the Seattle Art Institute.
{7512}{7545}Fucking shame.
{7570}{7643}We got that guy,|we got two bods in the back.
{8167}{8275}Here we got Mr. Wu,|and back here is Mr. Chang.
{8527}{8550}Hi, Michael.
{8584}{8608}David.
{8654}{8700}It's provocative, isn't it?
{8770}{8829}The position of the bodies|indicates two shooters...
{8830}{8893}...one by the counter,|the other by the door.
{8901}{8994}Wounds look like.45s.|Probably a failed stick-up.
{9005}{9106}Judging from the holes in the wall and the|blood splatter, I'd say it was a Magnum.
{9115}{9156}My guess, a.357.
{9188}{9278}If it was a stick-up,|the perp wasn't looking for money.
{9280}{9334}- How do you know that?|- Look.
{9516}{9603}Okay, I'd like a full report|on my desk by 9:00 a.m.
{9605}{9675}I have a press conference at 10:00.|You got that?
{9677}{9712}Yeah, okay.
{9758}{9815}- Good night.|- See you tomorrow.
{9917}{9952}All right.
{9987}{10013}Let's smoke it.
{10166}{10231}That's good with the smoke, thank you.
{10446}{10494}Here we go. Right here.
{10527}{10564}This one's been wiped.
{10632}{10715}Let's do an inventory,|and find out what was in these drawers.
{10723}{10790}Harold, inventory of the drawer, please.
{10818}{10897}Try drugs, Doc. It's a fuckin' drug store.
{10919}{11004}Drug store hit by a junkie.|Who would have thought?
{11015}{11065}Pretty fancy forensic work.
{11074}{11113}Thank you, Stewart.
{11129}{11200}When Dick Tracy's done in there, lock it up.
{11833}{11911}David, I found a candy bar. It's a PayDay.
{11920}{11984}No prints, but the bite mark's not bad.
{12001}{12028}What?
{12168}{12210}You think there's a connection?
{12211}{12309}Absolutely. Do a 48-hour rush|DNA analysis on the candy bar.
{12311}{12368}- What am I going to tell Stratton?|- Nothing.
{12370}{12440}You know what that's gonna cost?|He'll see the paperwork.
{12442}{12507}Just tell him it's routine.|He won't know the difference.
{12509}{12585}When I get fired,|will you visit me at the homeless shelter?
{12587}{12641}Curtis, help me out, please.
{12661}{12705}Okay? Please.
{12730}{12774}- All right.|- Thank you.
{12814}{12930}This is a photo from tonight's pharmacy,|and this is one from Mary's office. Look.
{13106}{13141}What's your point?
{13143}{13209}The pharmacy shooter could be my guy.
{13263}{13351}How many guys do you know|that twist up a matchbook like this?
{13352}{13384}Look at it.
{13454}{13551}It's 4:30 in the fucking morning,|and I've been up for 18 hours.
{13559}{13665}- What do you want me to do?|- I want you to question him about my wife.
{13696}{13723}That's it?
{13771}{13799}Yeah.
{13820}{13899}Well, you got it.|I want to get this guy, too.
{13923}{13971}I know it's been hard on you, Dave.
{14010}{14050}But sometimes...
{14066}{14121}...you just gotta let things go.
{14199}{14235}I can't, Don.
{14398}{14430}Thanks.
{14443}{14484}We'll get this guy.
{14521}{14579}- Is that it, Daddy?|- Let me see.
{14601}{14644}Yes, that's where I grew up.
{14645}{14751}Right over here is where I went|to high school, Garfield High.
{14764}{14847}- Same high school as Jimi Hendrix.|- Who's Jimi Hendrix?
{14863}{14929}Did Mommy go to|Garfield High School, too?
{14981}{15005}No.
{15011}{15098}She went to high school up north,|next to the university.
{15123}{15192}- Is that where she became a lawyer?|- Yes.
{15217}{15267}I want to be a lawyer, just like Mommy.
{15274}{15331}I thought you wanted to be a doctor,|like me.
{15333}{15388}No. Lawyers make more money.
{15404}{15469}- They do, do they?|- Yes, they do.
{15505}{15581}What about you, Cara?|What do you want to be?
{15607}{15681}I don't know. Can we go?|It's cold up here.
{15741}{15768}Okay.
{16153}{16208}- Did you have a good time?|- Yeah.
{16224}{16305}- How about you, Cara?|- It was okay, I guess.
{16348}{16405}Cara! Lindy! Over here.
{16449}{16500}Bye, Dad. We're going ice-skating tonight.
{16501}{16534}Don't I get a kiss?
{16612}{16635}Sorry.
{16781}{16836}- I love you.|- I love you, too.
{16839}{16889}- See you next week?|- Okay.
{16899}{16932}Gotta go.
{17007}{17048}Look what Dad got me.
{17050}{17114}- I get the front seat.|- No, you don't.
{17150}{17219}You get in the back, you get in the front.
{18738}{18792}- Sheila.|- You forgot.
{18810}{18892}The Wahlic Foundation, for dinner,|we had a date?
{18961}{18988}Yeah, I did.
{18990}{19065}{y:i}The next logical step for me was transfer.
{19085}{19184}{y:i}My original thesis of transferring|{y:i}intelligence was quite simple.
{19186}{19235}{y:i}The implications are obvious...
{19237}{19337}{y:i}... helping the mentally impaired|{y:i}or those with learning disabilities.
{19351}{19440}{y:i}Of course, who wouldn't want a piece|{y:i}of Einstein's brain power.
{19640}{19745}{y:i}To date I've made successful transfers|{y:i}of neuroelectrical impulses.
{19756}{19850}{y:i}Of course, it's impossible|{y:i}to get into the mind of rab lats.
{19908}{19950}{y:i}I mean, lab rats.
{19983}{20046}{y:i}But my findings show|{y:i}that they respond to the memory...
{20048}{20102}{y:i}... of certain incidents more than others.
{20118}{20157}{y:i}To us these would be things like...
{20159}{20247}{y:i}... your first date, your first kiss,|{y:i}or your first car wreck.
{20264}{20334}{y:i}Events or traumas in our lives|{y:i}that are so powerful...
{20336}{20385}{y:i}... they are unforgettable.
{20603}{20637}Excuse me.
{20832}{20865}What are you having?
{20899}{20937}A Maker's Mark.
{20948}{21029}- Maker's Mark and a mineral water, please.|- On ice.
{21106}{21158}I hadn't thought about|my first date in years.
{21159}{21208}- Sorry?|- Your speech.
{21223}{21267}First date, first kiss.
{21277}{21379}You were listening.|I thought I put the room to sleep.
{21381}{21494}It wasn't you. I think people tend to drink|more than usual at these kinds of dinners.
{21496}{21556}They want to get their money's worth.|Thank you.
{21617}{21648}And you?
{21674}{21735}I'm actually very interested in your work.
{21737}{21773}- Really?|- Yeah.
{21818}{21902}I'm glad I got a chance to meet you.|My name's David.
{21924}{21994}Martha. You're a neuroscientist?
{21998}{22071}No, I was a closet microbiologist in school.
{22127}{22226}- So you've really transferred memory?|- In lab rats, yes.
{22237}{22288}- Really? How?|- Excuse me.
{22309}{22382}They're going over to Cutter's|for a nightcap. Are you ready?
{22384}{22455}- Yeah, I'll be right with you.|- Okay.
{22551}{22585}I'm sorry.
{22607}{22644}I've gotta go.
{22663}{22744}I'd love to know more about your work.|Can I call you?
{22797}{22841}Sure, if you want.
{22865}{22955}Or you can stop by the university.|I'm there every day.
{22962}{23032}- Great. How about tomorrow?|- Tomorrow?
{23088}{23125}In the morning I'm free.
{23145}{23191}- 9:00 a.m.?|- That's great.
{23193}{23236}Great. Thanks a lot.
{23247}{23323}I look forward to talking with you.|Good night.
{23425}{23465}What's he like?
{23578}{23659}- He's just interested in the work.|- Sure he is.
{23698}{23734}That's what he said.
{23735}{23824}- You know who it is, don't you?|- No, I've never seen him before.
{23826}{23927}It's Dr. Krane. The medical examiner|who murdered his wife.
{23990}{24056}They all but caught that guy|crushing her skull in.
{24058}{24138}If the police hadn't botched the case,|he'd be on death row by now.
{24157}{24215}He seemed like a nice guy.
{24217}{24328}I'm sure he is. But if you go out with him,|make sure you wear a crash helmet.
{26448}{26485}Good morning.
{26505}{26544}Hi, Dr. Krane.
{26617}{26673}- You're early.|- I couldn't wait.
{26675}{26720}Do you still have time?
{26765}{26790}Sure.
{26803}{26855}- Do you need a hand?|- No.
{27251}{27318}Maybe it's easier if I just show you.
{27326}{27355}Great.
{27531}{27573}Good morning, Zelda.
{28040}{28070}Ready?
{28683}{28745}Animal rights people know about you?
{28885}{28941}As you know, Dr. Krane,|neuropeptides mediate...
{28943}{28986}David.
{29018}{29105}Neuropeptides mediate memory storage|and retrieval in the brain.
{29130}{29228}In theory a person's thought and memory|is contained in his cerebral spinal fluid.
{29230}{29283}- The CSF.|- Right.
{29285}{29374}But if you injected CSF,|you wouldn't see a thing. Why?
{29378}{29448}Because there's no starter,|there's no primer.
{29450}{29564}I started thinking about neuroactive drugs,|like norepinephrine and adrenaline.
{29566}{29659}They'd increase the brain's sensitivity|during memory retrieval.
{29675}{29702}Very good.
{29744}{29784}Hence, your starter.
{29792}{29817}Exactly.
{29839}{29901}This is it. My transfer formula.
{29903}{29993}It's a combination of norepinephrine,|a GABA inhibitor...
{30005}{30055}...and a few other things.
{30439}{30514}When injected, the brain experiences|these new memory impulses...
{30516}{30563}...as if they were its own.
{30647}{30741}For these impulses to be triggered,|the brain requires an outside stimulant...
{30743}{30854}...such as a sight, sound, or smell|that's familiar to the other brain's memory.
{30887}{30949}This rat isn't familiar with the maze,|as you just saw.
{30951}{31002}This is CSF from a rat|who knows the maze.
{31004}{31124}By injecting this CSF into this rat, he|should be able to run the maze perfectly.
{31126}{31196}- And the cat is...|- The outside stimulant.
{31205}{31260}It's there to make the memory more vivid.
{31632}{31657}Yes.
{31761}{31815}It has an 80% success rate.
{31825}{31935}- When do you start human trials?|- That's a long way off.
{31949}{31975}Why?
{31995}{32041}There are a few complications...
{32043}{32112}...not to mention about seven years'|worth of paperwork.
{32114}{32164}What kind of complications?
{32170}{32244}Like, the norepinephrine|stimulates the heart.
{32257}{32325}Heart rate and blood pressure|of all the rats increased.
{32327}{32403}- Unfortunately, 30% of them...|- Had heart attacks.
{32408}{32438}Can't reduce the dosage.
{32440}{32556}Anything that would inhibit the side effects|would also inhibit the memory retrieval.
{32558}{32613}What about taking nitroglycerine?
{32615}{32661}It might solve the short-term problems...
{32663}{32764}...but you'd still run the risk|of long-term damage to the heart.
{32870}{32938}CSF is routinely taken in all autopsies.
{32980}{33009}I know.
{33066}{33160}Every forensic pathologist has at least|one or two cases that can't be solved.
{33351}{33426}I have a class in 10 minutes.
{33449}{33498}I'd be willing to try it.
{33780}{33809}Excuse me.
{33835}{33958}I'm just as curious as the next scientist,|but that would be completely irresponsible.
{33993}{34043}This is not what I set out to do.
{34045}{34118}It's a byproduct,|I'd like to keep it that way.
{34355}{34378}Okay.
{34490}{34578}Thanks a lot for your time.|I appreciate it, Dr. Briggs.
{34662}{34707}Good luck with everything.
{34727}{34753}Thanks.
{35102}{35156}- Good morning, George.|- Morning, Dr. Krane.
{35158}{35212}- How are you?|- Fine, thank you.
{35218}{35268}- Is that from the pharmacy?|- Yeah.
{35270}{35368}Nasty. I heard he shot a girl in the face.|Is that true?
{35399}{35438}A real model citizen.
{36778}{36838}- Dr. Krane?|- Yeah, George?
{36924}{36976}I was just checking some numbers.
{36978}{37078}- It's cold in here. I could lend you a coat.|- No, I'm done.
{46074}{46101}Mary?
{47818}{47872}{y:i}You'll never catch me alive.
{48087}{48132}{y:i}... that we've exchanged this day.
{48151}{48263}{y:i}Now, by the power that's vested in me|{y:i}by the state and the church...
{51088}{51121}Dr. Krane.
{51161}{51218}- Are you okay?|- Yes, I'm fine.
{51220}{51280}Do you mind if I don't sign in?|I'm onto something.
{51281}{51327}You know I can't do that.
{51373}{51399}Look.
{51415}{51454}Just help me out here.
{51510}{51579}- Is that what I think it is?|- Yeah.
{51581}{51629}I could take a lot of heat for that.
{51633}{51742}Only if somebody finds out. And they're|not going to find out unless you tell them.
{51743}{51793}Come on, please.
{51882}{51926}I gotta visit the head.
{51946}{52016}Anybody shows, you're on your own.
{52043}{52072}Thanks.
{58373}{58425}No, his face is too round.
{58431}{58481}It was much more narrow.
{58487}{58556}Don't worry.|Focus on the eyes and the rest will follow.
{58558}{58629}They don't seem right either.|They're too...
{58713}{58750}Let me just...
{58850}{58949}The eyes are much more like this.
{59200}{59257}There. Those are the eyes.
{59452}{59498}I didn't know you could draw.
{59626}{59714}Donna Berman. Seattle Art Institute.
{59893}{59918}Thanks, Jeff.
{60379}{60410}Watch this.
{61461}{61495}Are you okay?
{61529}{61570}You're bleeding.
{61776}{61822}Maybe you should see a doctor.
{61830}{61882}Could you send that out for an ID?
{61898}{61980}Are you kidding?|I could book him on the "Queen Mary".
{61988}{62012}Gone.
{62019}{62046}Thanks.
{62206}{62304}I'm missing a vial of my formula,|and I know you have it.
{62306}{62344}I was gonna call you.
{62346}{62396}- Where is it?|- Just wait.
{62398}{62455}- You've had nosebleeds?|- Hi, Dr. Stratton.
{62477}{62559}Avery tells me you haven't finished|the pharmacy paperwork.
{62573}{62610}I'm running a little late.
{62612}{62686}- I need it on my desk by noon.|- Okay.
{62894}{62927}It works.
{62950}{63031}It was the most amazing thing|I ever experienced.
{63035}{63143}I took the nitroglycerine orally to counter|the side effects of the norepinephrine.
{63207}{63233}Where is it?
{63296}{63332}I used it all.
{63351}{63379}Twelve cc's?
{63415}{63440}Yeah.
{63514}{63606}I trusted you.|You had no right to take it from me!
{63614}{63687}You're right.|I took something, and I'm sorry.
{63714}{63801}But look what I've given you in return.|Your first human trial.
{63803}{63840}Who do you think you are?
{63877}{63939}You could have died. You had no right.
{63941}{63991}Aren't you even the least bit curious?
{64046}{64135}You created something incredible.|Do you know what I saw?
{64152}{64220}It's not what you thought.|It's not like memory.
{64226}{64316}It's more than that.|It was like a raw experience.
{64341}{64413}Like the past is present.|Like I was actually there.
{64418}{64467}Do you know murders can be solved?
{64469}{64534}Questions can be answered.
{64544}{64604}This is about your wife, isn't it?
{64648}{64701}You took her CSF, didn't you?
{64786}{64846}You have no idea|what you've done to yourself.
{64850}{64961}I have no idea. I haven't even completed|side-effect research on my rats.
{64984}{65097}I'm telling you that your formula works,|and you're talking to me about rats.
{65305}{65331}Okay.
{65414}{65457}I want you in my lab.
{65459}{65582}I need full blood work,|an EKG, full respiratory.
{65602}{65711}And a brain scan wouldn't be a bad idea,|just to make sure you have one.
{65744}{65782}It's not funny.
{65873}{65970}All right, I'll be by this afternoon.|Let me just finish this paperwork.
{65972}{66008}How about right now, Doctor?
{66078}{66133}No bruits. Regular rate and rhythm.
{66149}{66217}No murmurs, rubs or extra heart sounds.
{66229}{66266}And the lungs are clear.
{66715}{66763}There's been some damage.
{66906}{66950}I can live with that.
{66961}{67067}You can live with that? You've done|significant damage to your heart.
{67081}{67114}It's my heart.
{67119}{67218}It's my experiment.|If somebody finds out about this...
{67246}{67295}You're right. I'm sorry.
{67306}{67365}If there was another way,|I would have done it.
{67372}{67422}But what's done is done.
{67445}{67536}- Nobody will find out unless you tell them.|- Or unless you die.
{67542}{67588}I'm not gonna die.
{67613}{67670}Even if I did, they'd never link it to you.
{67672}{67784}Most MEs won't find foreign matter|unless they're told to look for it.
{67799}{67842}I can keep a secret, can you?
{68036}{68118}- Where's your phone?|- In there.
{68315}{68343}Avery, it's me.
{68345}{68406}They already found a match|on your drawing.
{68412}{68448}{y:i}This equipment is incredible.
{68449}{68506}- What's his name?|- Eddie Dutton.
{68508}{68597}This guy has a lovely résumé.|Listen to this.
{68600}{68679}Drugs, grand theft, aggravated assault.
{68684}{68773}They even tried to nail him on those|contract hits in Chinatown last year.
{68780}{68880}- What's his last known address?|{y:i}- 25 Hastings, Dodson Hotel.
{68882}{68920}{y:i}He lived with his girlfriend.
{68922}{69027}Okay. Call Bresler and tell him|that Dutton is the pharmacy shooter.
{69047}{69106}What should I say when he stops laughing?
{69107}{69166}{y:i}Tell him you ID'd him from the candy bar.
{69167}{69218}But I haven't. We're waiting to hear.
{69220}{69271}Please, you've gotta help me out.
{69273}{69333}Look, that's not confirmed. I can't put my...
{69335}{69388}Please, just do it for me.
{69407}{69447}All right, David.
{69467}{69517}But this time it's your ass.
{69572}{69602}I gotta go.
{69604}{69649}- No, you don't.|- I've got work to do.
{69650}{69708}You're not leaving my sight|for the next 48 hours.
{69710}{69751}I can't stay here.
{69792}{69841}Okay, I'll go with you.
{69865}{69895}- No.|- Yes.
{69897}{69923}Wait a minute.
{69925}{69992}You're the one who made yourself|part of my experiment.
{69994}{70033}I don't have time for this.
{70035}{70097}If you leave without me I'll call the police.
{70311}{70370}- Must you drive so fast?|- Yes.
{70400}{70440}It's part of my job.
{70609}{70720}1:00 p.m. Subject appears irritable,|anxious and tense.
{71062}{71141}- Stay with the car.|- Where are you going?
{71944}{71973}Hang on.
{72073}{72110}- Are you the manager?|- Yeah.
{72112}{72167}I'm with the Seattle|Medical Examiner's Office.
{72169}{72219}I'm looking for a guy named Eddie Dutton.
{72220}{72293}- Do you know where I could find him?|- Are you a cop?
{72295}{72330}No, I'm with the Seattle...
{72374}{72399}Damn it.
{72904}{72957}What are you staring at?
{73029}{73107}Fuckin' fag.|What are you looking at me like that for?
{73117}{73160}Are you a pretty boy?
{73173}{73220}Get out of here, you fuckin'...
{73876}{73901}Sorry.
{74548}{74583}David, you have to stop!
{74594}{74670}- Your heart! It's extremely weak.|- Get lost!
{74675}{74702}You have to stop.
{75008}{75035}Shit.
{75101}{75187}What the fuck do you think you're doing?|Get out of the fuckin' truck.
{75202}{75283}- You fucked up my car.|- I'm sorry. It was just an accident.
{75285}{75359}You can't see a fuckin'|parked car on the street?
{75361}{75422}I said I was sorry.|What do you want me to do?
{75424}{75499}- Are you okay?|- Get your fuckin' wallet out of the car.
{75501}{75550}- Martha Briggs.|- Fuck you.
{75943}{75971}Okay.
{76209}{76276}- You are fuckin' lucky.|- Move the car!
{80553}{80655}We know the way we would|like to reason...
{80677}{80766}...but all too often it leads to change.
{80797}{80897}And it's how we react to this change...
{81003}{81035}Let him go!
{81059}{81083}Put him down.
{81109}{81132}Put him down!
{81134}{81222}Back off right now, or I'm going to cut him.
{81234}{81270}Please, he's only a child.
{81272}{81303}Back off!
{81315}{81345}You don't think I'll cut him?
{81555}{81606}I'll fucking cut him like a fish.
{81635}{81690}Right through the guts, man. Back off.
{81733}{81779}Call the dogs off, man.
{81796}{81842}Fuck off! Back up!
{81851}{81900}Put the knife down.
{81919}{82038}Call your dogs off right now,|or I'm going to cut him.
{82044}{82109}Please, put the gun down.
{82131}{82198}Yeah, put the gun down. Come on, man.
{82215}{82269}Put the gun down now!
{82373}{82411}Put them down!
{82574}{82639}- What's it gonna be?|- Take it easy.
{82653}{82750}I don't give a fuck anymore.|Get me a car, or this boy is gonna die.
{82766}{82796}Stop moving, man.
{82820}{82854}Back up, man.
{82880}{82947}Nobody's listening to me! Back up!
{82958}{82992}Put the kid down.
{82995}{83036}I'm gonna run this boy.
{83055}{83080}Eddie.
{83116}{83139}No!
{83325}{83352}Get off!
{83368}{83415}Stay back. Nobody move!
{83453}{83490}Aw, shit.
{83520}{83588}Jesus, Krane! What are you doing here?
{83625}{83668}I was following a lead.
{83675}{83704}Lead?
{83726}{83814}You're way out of bounds, Krane.|This isn't the fucking Coroner's Office.
{83816}{83874}Get up! Tell me that again.
{83900}{83986}I was following a lead.|He was getting away. That's his gun.
{83998}{84098}Is that right? I think you've seen|one too many episodes of "Quincy".
{84114}{84139}It's over.
{84176}{84240}Keep this up, you'll get yourself killed.
{84456}{84500}Is that the guy?
{84629}{84678}I guess I'll never know.
{84777}{84818}Get this guy out of here.
{85837}{85877}Are you all right?
{85993}{86022}David?
{86029}{86065}Could we talk?
{86095}{86189}- Could you excuse us, please?|- I'll wait outside.
{86277}{86343}You went behind my back|for the saliva test.
You can't take the Chyron chip rom me!
It's my idea, my design, my patent.
Trace you have to defend your patent for the Chyron chip...
The investors have financed the development of the chip
By law, if they can't be repaid, the patent belongs to them.
You can't give it to them!
They will pollute the vision of everything my chip stands for
Here is an opening!
It has fire marks on it!
Break it in!
This way.
We got a live one over here
- Get the gurney out.
Pull gurney out.
We have to repair that shattered maxillary fracture.
We're gonna lose him. We're gonna fix that damn artery
We're losing the vital signs, get me RD forty.
Heart stopped.
He need to defibrillate.
- Clear!
- One, two, three!
Patient is a male.
Late twenties... multiple amputee, smoke lesions on the lungs... and third degree burns over eighteen per cent of his body.
Transferred from County?
They amputated both of his legs and reconstructed his face.
- Well, what's the veredict?
- It's hard to tell... so many different pathways through the interface only one way to find out.
Hello, can you hear me?
Peter Peter pumpkin eater?
- What does it mean?
- It means he can hear us.
What is your name?
- Peter Peter pumpkin eater.
Maybe his name is Peter.
I'll try this. "Had a wife, but couldn't keep her".
Jobe... Hello, Jobe.
Jobe, tell me about yourself.
Empty space. It is all just empty space inside... like it is been erased.
Try to visualize all the people and places that you have met.
Just relax and let the images come to you.
- Jobe! Hey, Jobe!
- Hi, Peter.
- Look what I've got.
Is that the new Cosmic Man?
- Yeah, it is great!
- Thanks, buddy.
Happy birthday, Jobe. Make a wish
Excuse me... Jobe. I am Jonathon
Walker. I run this place...
I own the patent to the Chyron chip and you can build it.
Jobe, there is nothing to be afraid of...
Virtual Reality will rehabilitate your mind your body...
You'll be alright, I promise... just concentrate. Okay?
We'll try some music.
Access granted.
LOS ANGELES. The future.
Hey, Matt... Matt!
- Come here. Have you seen Peter?
No, sorry...
Get down on your knees, repent!
Man destroys man.
Before the end. Get down and pray for forgiveness before...
Thank you. Your videophone access code is approved.
Yeah! That was awesome!
Here, let me see... Cool! Here.
- Crap!
Man are you okey?
Are you crazy, Peter?
You know it can't hurt me.
- How long, Travis?
- Right now. Did you get it?
Just shoulder sifted it on the way over.
You are a saint. Thank you.
Come on, let's go inside...
I've got his password you got the access code...
Man, we are set.
What's up, Travis?
How about a taste of remote presence, my friends?
All hooked up and ready to go.
All right.
Et's use the Cybercycle disc.
- No way, I am flying.
- Me too.
I am waitin' for this all day.
Please enter videophone access code... trapdoor access to Cyberscape granted... ten, nine, eight, seven... six, five, four, three... two, one...
Trapdoor opened. Enter now.
- Peter, what's happening?
- What's going on?
Who is doing this?
Shawn, the Cybercycles.
Harvey, put in the
Cybercycle disc...
Harvey, can you hear me? Put in the Cybercycle disc now!
No one jacks-out until we find who is doing this!
You are alive! How can that be?
There isn't time, Peter.
Need your help. I am diyng.
What do you mean dying?
The Cyberspace is dying and so am I right along with it...
I am trapped here, Peter.
You have to help me.
- I do not get it.
- I need you to find Trace.
- What?
Doctor Benjamin Trace.
When the Cyberspace dies, so do I.
What if he won't jack-in?
I'm building his chip Chyron,
I need the Egypt link.
- Peter?
- Peter!
I do not think he's breathing.
- What do we do?
- Let's try CPR.
- Hurry up, we have no time.
Alright.
One, two, three, four, five...
Breath! Breath, Peter!
One, two, three, four, five.
Breath!
It is not working.
One, two, three, four...
Come on, get up. Are you OK?
If you knew you were in danger, you should have jacket-out!
It was the most exciting tele- presence I've ever lived.
I want to talk to Halloway person to person, okay?
I don't want any other nonsense.
We are running out of time.
Well, Senator Greenspan. How wonderful to see you again...
Welcome to the
Virtual Light Institute.
My head of research and development, Doc. Cori Platt... and this is Jennifer.
Please come with me, Senator.
Senators, Virtual Light... until now, no one has had he ability to create... an entire computer network based ithin Virtual Reality...
I'll render all other systems obsolete.
Virtual Reality has evolved from a simulation to an actual place.
Watch your head, those monitors'll kill you...
So, it is like a whole new world out there.
Full of interesting possibilities
I understand.
I love a man that does his homework. Do not you, Doctor?
Well, Senator, what is holding us back is final... congressional approval of our license.
This must be the Chyron chip that everybody is talking about.
The key to my
Virtual Light Uplink.
Since the information superhighway... has left people feeling isolated from their fellow man... the Virtual Light Institute will bring cultures together... in one continuous
Virtual Enviroment.
And this is our main control room... hub of all our operations here at
Virtual Light.
I am still a little unclear as to ow this fits together.
Well, I am sure Doctor Platt will enlighten you. Jennifer, please.
The outer circle represents the real world... the inner one, Virtual Reality... the spokes are the different pathways between the two... the Chyron chip will open up these pathways simultaneously... so a network based inside VR can be accessed by everyone.
So, next miracle...
When you hook into the library of my Virtual city... you hook into every library in the world... the chip will bring everything on line for everyone.
Well, yes, it is very pretty, onathon, but I think... we'd be placing quite a concentration of power in your lap
My lap is your lap, Senator.
- Twinkie?
How did it go?
Walker makes me feel like the star poodle on his dog show.
- At least you get top billing.
- Walker always gets top billing.
The Chyron chip and designing the Virtual City.
I do not mind.
I care about how other people see you, how they perceive you.
That's your world, Dr. Platt, not mine. My world is in here... out there people look at me and they see half a person... but in here, they see what
I want them to see...
- how I really am.
- I don't see half a person.
- That's your world.
- Good night, Jobe
What do you want?
You sure don't look like the ather of Virtual Reality to me.
- What?
- You are Dr. Benjamin Trace, right?
- He's dead.
- Dead?
That's not what they said in the
Internet. They said he was here.
The Benjamin Trace you want is resting in peace.
I suggest you get on that cool bike of yours and go on home.
Don't know what Jobe was thinking he's just as crazy as this guy.
Trippy fool invented some kind of
Chyron chip.
- What did you say?
Chyron chip?
Come inside.
- So, what's your name, kid?
- Peter... Doc.
Call me Trace. Well, Peter, it's all in here. All the answers
- in the water, in the air...
- The reason I came is because.
My friend Jobe is dying. You're he only one who could save him.
You seem a bit young to know anything about the Chyron chip.
- Well, Jobe told me about it.
- Who is Jobe?
He was our lawnmower man back when my mom was still alive... he was my best friend, but now he's stuck in Virtual Reality.
- What does he know about it?
- He is building it.
- He is building it?
- That's what he said. I need you
I don't live that life anymore.
That technology just consumes you
I need your help. You can find me at the 3rd st. Station.
Tunnel eleven, if you change your mind.
Doctor Benjamin Trace.
Only he can stop this.
- What if he won't jack-in?
Tell him I'm building his chip.
- My dog does not stink.
- Yes, it does, Shawn...
- the funck is burning my eyes.
- It does not stink!
I looked at him and I almost went blind. Harvey used... to be a poodle. He looks like a Chihuahua on steroids.
Who is it?
You know this guy, Peter?
Back off. This is the guy Jobe old me about!
- You all live down here?
- This is just our summer cottage.
- I love your ventilation system.
Listen, this guy can help us.
Adults have betrayed me my whole life. You know that, Peter.
Look, Travis, you don't have to trust him. You must trust Peter.
So, you are the Einstein of VR?
I'll take that as a compliment, Travis...
You know, Einstein made a few mistakes himself.
- What are these?
- Man, you must be a dinosaur!
The electroplates on the sides?
They hit your temple and tap into certain neurons, giving you full neuro-sensory involvement.
- You can actually feel?
- Exactly...
See, that's why we have to save
Jobe, though. Because he's real in there. He dies in there, he is going to die out there.
Are you sure Jobe need saving?
What are you trying to say? Jobe wouldn't lie to me.
You said you couldn't trust any adults
He's not like you. I mean, he's like a kid. He was until...
- Until what?
- Until my next door nieghbor did some experiments with him in VR and turned him from a simpleton into a genius. We are wasting time. You can ask him yourself.
- Ready!
Let's hook it up. Let's do it.
- Doc, here is your stuff.
No, I do not want to go into VR
- Why not?
I'm not ready yet. It is scary.
- I might get lost or something.
- Fine, I'll go in.
Back door access to Cyberspace granted, please stand by.
Welcome to my world, Peter.
Did you bring the good Doctor?
- No, he's watching.
- Jack-in, jack-off.
Scared of the boogy man, doctor?
You can at least humor me with a point of view, can not you?
It is a pleasure to finally meet you. I feel like we're almost
I am blushing... family.
- I do not think so, Jobe.
- Don't be sure."Incest", the game... the whole family can play.
My brother is my Daddy.
Doc, we are both unwanted, under appreciated and... ahead of our time. And the only difference is your time was then.
- My time is now.
- It's a short ride. Enjoy it.
I plan to enjoy it for a long time. I've found the secret to...
- inmortality in the Chyron chip.
- Where is the Chyron chip?
Come with me, won't you?
There she is... Miss Chyron chip!
It is taken years of work, but our Chyron chip is a reality.
Look what I am doing, Doctor.
Sn't it amazing?
You do not look like you are in danger. What do you want?
Egypt. Do not hold back on me. It is a hidden "nano-routine" encoded into the design of he Chyron chip.
- I'm not going to help you.
- You share Egypt with me and I'II... share with you technological knowledge beyond your dreams.
This is your worl too, Doctor.
Your work helped create it.
My work is to build it. Now, tell me. What does Egypt mean?
I'm not going to tell you.
You don't understand its power
I do, Doctor. And in 3 days I'll be in every system in the world
Tell me what Egypt means, doctor, before I get really pissed off!
Get out of here, Peter!
It is getting out of control!
Something is wrong. I've neverseen Jobe like that before.
Stop it! I can stop it!
I thought you said the trains didn't run through these tunnels.
They do not!
Oh, my God, It is heading right for us!
Get out of here!
But this is our home!
Dispatch, do something!
Implement emergency procedures immediately.
Dispatch shut all systems down.
Disengage...
Come on! Jade, Peter, hurry up!
The game is afoot.
Closed track. Code red.
The caboose is loose.
Shawn, let's go, come on!
I can not leave Harvey here!
Come on, Trace, get out of there!
Let's get out of here, it is going to blow!
Now, let's deal with the true believers.
Show me all the contributors to fundamental world religions over.
The past five years.
And each user thinks that they have total privacy.
Every time anyone logs onto
Virtual Light Uplink... we'll know everything about them.
Show me all hypocriticaldemocrats making over 300,000 a year.
That train was no accident, was it?
Not a chance.
Man, now we have lost our home and the Cyberspace.
I bet Jobe did it, so he could build this his city.
Like this world didn't suck enough already.
I think that's just a taste of what he could do if.
It can not get any worse.
W What's with this Egyptthing,
Doesn't he need it from you?
If Jobe's worried about Egypt, it means he's about to use it to its full hideous potential.
Which is?
Enter every system in the world and take over through VR.
So is there any way to stop him or... should we just start digging ourown graves?
We've got to stael him the Chyron chip before he figures out Egypt.
Federal Library?
If we could use their computers we'll find the chip.
That's right, Peter, let's go.
Initiate image regeneration.
You have to help me.
Isn't that just like a recording?
We have to strip away the layers within the program to discover who the software that Jobe used to enter VR was licensed to.
We have a problem.
I can not get past the memory lock to isolate the chain.
Simple. Just enhance the memoryindex.
What have we got hare?
Actualize data.
Five...
Here we go...
Execute worm function.
Enhance.
Redimensionalize variables.
All we have to do now is access
Datatronic Systems.
I am right with you, Doc... there is our registered wner. Platt.
I am accessing phone listings, now.
We have forty three Platts.
See if you have a Cori Platt.
No Cori, but we have 3 C.
Platts. One is a PhD.
Trace, pull over.
Aren't we going to Dr.
Platt's apartment?
First we have to get tracker so she can lead us to the chip.
It is locked.
- How are they going to do this?
- No problem. My brother can... handle it. He is great at this kind of stuff.
It is unlocked. Let's go shopping.
Well, the extra day I got
Greenspan to stay was useless... that liberal idiot is on his way back to Washington right now... to recommend that they rescind our license to go on line.
If we lose that license, we aredead.

You are awfully nosey, aren't you, Guillermo?
Hi, you haven't forgotten me?
No for lack of trying.
How have you been?
Fine, Ben. What do you want?
I need to talk to you. About Jobe
- He's not what you think he is.
Neither were you.
He's very dangerous, Cori.
Hardly. And what makes you think you can just show up here... and entertain a conversation with me?
- You have right to be angry
- I am not angry. I am leaving!
Let's go.
You look terrific. More beautiful than I remember.
Has Jobe used up all the memory in your system?
Every printed word, thought and deed in human history... couldn't begin to fill up the type of memory we are using.
Because of my Chyron chip.
I heard you deserted that project just like you did us.
I am sorry you lost the patent.
I do not want pity, Cori.
I want the chip.
And you want me to help you get it. Forget it.
You should know what Jobe is up to.
Do not patronize me, Trace.
I'm not your student anymore.
He tried to kill me, Cori... you musn't not let go him go on line. Check his data file... you'll be surprised of what you find there.
- How are we doing?
- Cool. The tracker is working.
That's where we have to break into to get the chip?
Do you have any ideas?
We could have Jade tap into the
County engineering and pull up... the blue prints on that place.
That's good idea.
You are cleverer than you look.
- Where is David?
- I don't know. He was just here.
Take that down to the mail room.
Arthur, it looks like you have been going at it for hours.
Walker's orders.
You don't do anything on this project withuot my authorization.
Can I speak with you for a moment?
I do take my responsabilities just as seriously as you do.
You do your job, a nd let me do mine.
What exactly is your job?
We've got a problem.
All available memory capacity on the I ten eighty six S is gone.
That's imposible.
I know that.
What's is going on? I didn't authorize this equipment.
- What happened to the memory?
- I forgot.
- Walker's behind schedule.
- We are not behind the schedule.
He is losing memory and he wants
Jobe working around the clock on the Virtual Light
I'm not going to discuss this with you.
He's going on line tomorrow.
Mr. Walker... Mr. Walker...
I think you have made a mistake,
Doctor.
No. I think you have made a mistake.
Why wasn't I notified that you intend to put Jobe on line?
We'II, you are just a scientist.
I am a businessman.
And Jobe is a human being.
And every day that VR goes unfinished is costing me millions in potential revenue.
He's showing signs of instabilities. I am worried.
Well, the man is at a distinct disadvantage.
You've been profiting off this man's misery for years... how many times have you postponed his prosthetics legs?
I couldn't have him getting up and walking out on us now... could I? Why do not we discuss this after Jobe goes on line?

- Dr. Platt!
Henry! You startled me.
Just making my rounds.
Is everything okay?
I was just dropping off some production charts for the week.
- Good night, Henry.
Good night.
- Are you all right?
Yes, we'll be just fine.
Wait! Let me...
Me again. I was right, wasn't I?
Jobe is expanding his memory base
Get out of the car.
Good, I caught you.
A guard reported seeing you in my office this evening.
You could have come up with a better excuse
Jobe is going on line tomorrow, so I wanted to deliver...
- them to you myself.
- I see. Well. Good.
Be sure you get some rest.
We have a big day tomorrow.
You are working for Jonathon
Walker? He stole my patent.
He didn't exactly steal it.
He was one of the investors that took me to court.
Get out of the car!
I was right about the memory base
I am right about Jobe.
I don't think you or Walker understand the power...
Get out.
I thought you were better than this, Cori.
You stole a gun?
No, man. It is a camera, check it out.
Cool.
Alright. Let's do it.

Come. I have an idea.
It's Doctor Platt. I seemto have left my key card in the lab.
Yes, Doctor. I'm sorry, we didn't know it was you.
Thank you.
You ready?
I don't think so. This isn't one of your best ideas.
I wouldn't trust anybody else.
You can do it.
Grab it! Grab it!
What are you doing?
He will kill them!
What is going on?
- By the way, who are you?

Sector four secured.
You want the chip?
Put your guns down...
Put them down or I will smash it.
Put them down now!
Slide them forward.
You have the card?
What now? Here!
- Where?
- Go on. Go.
Why did I let you back into my life?
You find me irresistible.
You got the chip?
Good work.
You are bleeding.
Let us get out of there.
- What is that?
- Just some dirt.
Bring it to me!
Get that dirt, you idiots!
Take off your shirt.
What do you have in mind?
I need to stop this bleeding and
I'm not going to use my shirt.
Do I know you, guys?
- I owe you an apology, Cori.
- You could say that.
- Do you mind?
- Not at all.
Okay, so apologize.
I am sorry, Cori. I really am.
I did not want to see anybody.
I was too ambitious, I was naive
Stupid.
That too.
Thanks for the medical attention.
You are welcome for the medical attention.
Race you to the top of the hill.
Pretty neat, huh?
It's incredible...
They were able to bypass the capability protection registers?
It makes me wonder if I could have ever finished it myself.
The chip was supposed to make things better for them.
Ironic. Still maybe it could.
What did he do here?
That's where Jobe merged the nano-matching hardware.
He couldn't have. There is no trans-matrix.
There isn't.
Something's wrong.
It should be there.
So you lost the chip.
You idiot.
Do you honestly think I'd entrust something that important to you?
Voila!
People want a show... and now that Jobe has solved the link, the chip can be activated.
Now, get out of my sight.
Any progress?
Jobe is tracking down the intruders
And you are a genious.
Yes, I know. I think it is time we call the President.
Try to get Virtual Light Europe.
- Where?
- Anywhere.
Uplink, England, Virtual Light...
Nothing.
Greetings, Mr. President.
And thank you for joining us in this momentous occasion.
I am happy to be here.
I was shocked to hear about
Greenspan's dreadful accident...
I know how much he wanted to be a part of what we are doing here.
But, "la vie continue"...
We will be joined by hundreds of others prominent people... who'll be jacking-in from all over the country... so, if you are ready, don your eyephones... and we can begin.
- I am...
- Just relax.
Ladies and gentlemen...
Welcome to Virtual Light...
We stand in the face of a new age...
The future is one world... one thought, one mind...
Behold.
The future is now!
Twelve hours to Global interface.
It is all taken care of.
The foreign marketplace will be secure only when they place... their money in your hands.
Excellent work, Jobe.
- It is already started to happen
What's that supposed to mean?
It means that Jobe must have figured a way around Egypt.
And he's using the chip to enter... every system around the world, replacing it with himself
It takes about twelve hours for the interface to complete.
Once complete it is irreversible.
Walker is going to stop him.
Are you crazy? Who do you think is doing this with him?
Walker is a businessman and Jobe is bad for business.
Come on!
What a surprise. I did not expect to hear from you so soon, Doctor.
You have to stop Jobe before it's too late.
Too late? What happened to your sense of loyalty, Cori?
You wouldn't know the meaning of the word, Walker.
Is that Doctor Benjamin Trace?
Listen, Walker, you have to take
Jobe off line immediately.
I would love to accommodate you,
Doctor, I really would.
But that is not an opinion
I can exercise right now.
Listen to me, you stupid bastard!
If you do not take him off line you will have no options.
Are you threatening me, Doctor?
No, I'm not. Jobe is.
Jobe is a loyal employee.
I 'd trust him with my life.
You better, because you just gave it to him.
Time to get rid of some pesky little roaches.
Stop. Back two sectors.
Enhance.
They check in, but they do not check out.
Systems override.
Still no response. Control,
I need help, I have a Mayday!
Control, you need to reply.
We are Alpha six!
Doctor, we have company.
Reference present position.
We are going in after him.
You have to help me.
Override the system!
Let's get out of here.
I lost frequency.
Help me out of here!
Two hours to Global Interface.
Give me access to all credit accounts.
I am sorry, your account is overdrawn.
This card is no longer valid.
ATM machins...
Department of Water and Power.
Reports of city wide civil disturbances have been verified.
As the police department has gone on full tactical alert.
But with automated system failures occurring throughout... the city, response is expected to be slower than usual.
Already the violence has taken... several lives and few see an end to thecontinuing chaos.
Officials are reporting an outbreak of looting and random... myhem throughout the city, nation and globe.
He has finished this city.
That's why he waited, so he could offer an alternative.
People need hope.
If he can destroy our world, we will have to turn to him... a new Messiah in Cyberspace.
But you can not live in Cyberspace.
Jobe can.
He can achieve global interface, we won't have any choice.
- Egypt.
- Where they built the first dam.
- The chip is a dam.
Exactly.
Come to me all who have burdens.
I will set you free.
And you will no longer be the children of a lost generation.
It is time to take control of the system!
There shall be no more authority to oppress you.
We can all be the authority.
Jack into a new world order.
Follow Jobe...
Follow Jobe...
Escape the violence and greed that threatens to consume you.
Come be one with your fellow man.
This is true spirituality.
There shall be no more authority to oppress you.
World economic markets have been taken some of the worst collapses in the history.
Jonathon, I have some bad news and I have some bad news.
Where are you going?
Come back here!
Stay here!
You can not go anywhere!
Come on!
Jobe, what the hell is going on?
We have lost control. AII the lab files are disappearing!
Are you messing with me?
Answer me.
That is an order.
You have no power to give orders.
In 100 years your petty financial empire will not mean anything... but I'll still be here.
You son of a bitch!
Without me you are nothing but a deaf and dumb cripple.
I made you and I can unmake you.
Twenty minutes to
Global Interface...
You can't disconnect him.
Virtual Jobe will remain inside.
You can either heavily sedate him or take him out.
If you want to take me out... just ask.
Open the door, goddammit!
Bastard!
Alright. If that is the way you want to play it.
Prime alert. Security breach.
Code Red. Code Red.
All personnel will evacuate the building immediately
There are three terrorists on the premises... fully armed and dangerous moving down corridor 6D.
Shoot on sight.
Repeat, shoot to kill.
That son of a bitch.
- Sir, there were terrorist here.
- We are the terrorists you idiot!
Give me that gun.
There are three terrorists on the premises.
Shoot on sight.
Repeat, shoot to kill.
Fifteen minutes to
Global Interface.
Give yourselves to me.
Your re-birth in the womb of
Cyberspace is a chance for a new beginning. To live in Eden... without hunger, without famine... without temptation!
Ten minutes to Global Interface.
We have got ten minutes, Cori, you better watch the monitors...
Pull the real chip at the exact moment you destroy the Virtual.
Check it out, man.
Let us look!
If we can just jack in to that dome unnoticed...
No. Jobe knows all about anyone who jacks into the dome.
We have to find another way in.
These are the routes for the information superhighway... that lead directly into the dome.
You do not have to jack in, Doc.
You have a problem jacking into VR?
No, I will be fine. I am not going to run away this time.
Listen, guys...
We are going to follow the superhighway through the city... to where it goes underground all the way into the dome.
We'll take this access route follow that up inside and comes the tricky bit. We have to get by Jobe and smash the chip.
How are we going to get through the city?
Well, how about a little bike ride?
Okay, let's do it.
Destroying the chip won't stop.
What do you really have in mind?
The chip gave Jobe the power to go on line.
It contains a dam function to prevent the use of absolute power
We destroy the chip, we destroy the dam and expose Jobe.
I am going to make him angry enough to destroy himself.
Trace, we have to go!
If you can not, get out, I don't want you disappearing on me again
You shall wait no more. The
Prophecy has already been fulled.
For I have seen the Heavens and a voice of the throne saving...
There will be chaos in the streets!
And in the final days, the material world will fade away... and only Cyberspace will remain.
In the womb of Cyberspace is a chance for a new begining... to live in Eden without hunger... without famine. With me... you will find refuge.
We came to save to you, Jobe.
In here, I am the savior.
I will crush you!
You are just thelawnmower man, Jobe.
The lawnmower man is dead!
By the way...
I don't have to worry about Egypt anymore. I simply built around it
You destroyed Peter's world.
I am going to destroy yours.
Six... five...
...four... three...
...two... one...
You are a fool, Trace. I don't need the Chyron chip anymore.
I have become the chip.
You've betrayed, Peter, Jobe.
You have sold your soul for nothing.
You don't even have enough power to destroy me.
Is that all you have got, Jobe?
Is that all you have got?
Is that the best you can do?
What's... happening... to me?
Egypt, Jobe. Egypt!
Jobe, come here! Make a wish.
Make a wish.
We are back!
Hey, my pal. Well done.
I need to see Jobe.
Okay. Let us go.
There he is.
Be careful.
Probable pathways to interface... forty thousand... eighty four...
He's regressing.
Well, isn't that touching?
I want the chip. You can keep the rest, for what is worth.
We will give you the chip, give us the kid.
I really dislike repeating myself
Give him the chip.
By the way, Doctor Platt, you are fired.
I though I lost you, man.
Let's go home.
{763}{817}What's this? Filipino New Year's?
{831}{869}No. Why you say that?
{871}{915}'Cause you're cooking a feast.
{917}{977}I can smell it from the interstate.
{985}{1039}What is that? Barbecue?
{1044}{1104}Yeah. But it not coming from here.
{1125}{1164}What is that noise?
{6232}{6294}What is your take on this, Jerry?
{6307}{6367}The people will love it, Mr. President.
{6375}{6485}Our conflict is whether we ambush|the 6:00 news or hold out for prime time.
{6489}{6545}Screw the press.|This is a need-to-know situation.
{6547}{6643}We should make it top secret,|and should move in with Defcon Four.
{6648}{6693}We can't sit on this.
{6733}{6792}General Casey, do you have an opinion?
{6825}{6855}Well, sir...
{6859}{6895}...do we know they are hostile?
{6897}{6943}What do you mean?
{6953}{7015}They have the planet surrounded|by thousands of warships!
{7017}{7063}Do we know they're warships?
{7147}{7221}Professor, what do we know about them?
{7261}{7313}They're very advanced technologically.
{7315}{7393}Which suggests, rightfully so,|that they're peaceful.
{7407}{7512}An advanced civilization is,|by definition, not barbaric.
{7515}{7551}Mr. President...
{7560}{7597}...this is a great day.
{7599}{7647}I and all my colleagues...
{7651}{7693}...are extremely excited.
{7704}{7726}Good.
{7755}{7812}Extraterrestrial life.
{7839}{7879}You're right, Jerry.
{7884}{7944}The people are going to love it.
{7947}{8004}This is a momentous occasion.
{8025}{8045}Mr. President--
{8047}{8091}We'll go all media on this.
{8095}{8137}I'll wear my Cerruti suit.
{8141}{8181}I'll need a good speech.
{8205}{8239}Statesman-like...
{8247}{8288}...historical and yet...
{8293}{8341}...warm, neighborly.
{8345}{8436}Abraham Lincoln meets|Leave it to Beaver, kind of thing.
{8472}{8511}Are they too old-fashioned?
{8513}{8551}No, I don't think so.
{8557}{8640}This has got the colors but, no.|I don't think so.
{8643}{8676}Not vivid enough.
{8681}{8729}Nancy had this in the library.
{8733}{8751}Yes, indeed.
{8753}{8783}I don't think so.
{8785}{8866}I thought perhaps the watered silk.|This week it's on sale.
{8875}{8940}I hardly think I need worry about that.
{8943}{9007}My husband is the leader of the free world.
{9036}{9071}What do you think?
{9087}{9184}Why don't you leave the Roosevelt Room|the way the Roosevelts wanted it.
{9201}{9303}Because Eleanor Roosevelt was|too fond of chintz. That's why.
{9313}{9363}Mother, this isn't your house.
{9367}{9441}lf you're going to be a pest, I'll ignore you!
{9447}{9474}Mrs. Dale?
{10012}{10076}I saw you fight Sonny Liston in '69.
{10080}{10106}Really?
{10110}{10162}You were a nun back then?
{10166}{10242}We've always been fight fans,|haven't we sisters?
{10250}{10304}Byron Williams, telephone.
{10308}{10334}I must go.
{10338}{10398}You ladies have a nice time.
{10533}{10565}Oh, Louise.
{10578}{10630}Sorry to call you at work, but...
{10642}{10742}...the boys haven't been home|in two nights. I don't know what to do.
{10746}{10796}You're doing the best you can.
{10802}{10844}They're just at that age.
{10894}{10977}The casino manager's giving me|the evil eye. I've gotta go.
{10980}{11022}I'll call you later, okay?
{11042}{11118}Are you still cool on me|coming to Washington?
{11122}{11162}'Course I am.
{11174}{11236}You take care, okay? Bye.
{11618}{11662}Must you drink in front of me?
{11664}{11714}You're an adult. Just cope.
{11718}{11794}It doesn't help me|that all we ever do is sit in bars.
{11798}{11842}This is work, baby, okay?
{11846}{11934}I'm checking the decor,|the lighting, the traffic flow.
{11938}{12010}lf I'd known you'd turn into a crook,|I wouldn't have married you.
{12012}{12058}I'm not a crook.
{12062}{12114}I'm ambitious. There's a difference.
{12116}{12182}lf you think you can make|a nickel in this town...
{12184}{12274}...without knowing how to dally|around a few curves, well...
{12282}{12346}...you know nothing|of the gambling industry.
{12382}{12480}The Galaxy's going to be|the best hotel in Vegas.
{12484}{12524}The best!
{12529}{12550}I promise.
{12552}{12614}But don't you realize what you're doing?|You're destroying the Earth!
{12616}{12686}All this greed! This money system!
{12690}{12742}You're destroying everything!
{12760}{12806}Okay, Barbara, okay.
{12814}{12864}Keep your voice down.
{12882}{12930}I got friends here.
{12962}{12985}Sugar!
{12994}{13028}Hit me one more time.
{13030}{13064}Stop flirting with the waitress.
{13066}{13098}God. Here.
{13136}{13178}Go over to the roulette...
{13216}{13258}...play our anniversary...
{13260}{13310}...and stay off of black.
{13386}{13406}Thanks.
{13611}{13675}Make it quick,|we go out live in ten minutes.
{13695}{13752}What? The actual president?
{13757}{13785}Cutting in?
{13887}{13963}Budget negotiations may be dead|in the water after this week.
{13965}{14004}Hair looks good.
{14037}{14063}I like the hair.
{14065}{14117}...quote, ''factually-challenged. ''
{14137}{14179}Yeah, Stone. Speak.
{14183}{14219}Jason, hi, it's me.
{14247}{14282}You wearing a bra?
{14293}{14384}Listen, this is big. President Dale|is cutting into my show today.
{14423}{14492}That's absurd. Why would he stoop|to being on ''Today in Fashion''?
{14494}{14529}He's interrupting everybody.
{14531}{14613}I don't know, it's some sort of|an emergency announcement.
{14617}{14682}This doesn't make sense.|He should talk to us.
{14707}{14756}White House is coming out live.
{14779}{14847}Good evening, my fellow Americans.
{14855}{14943}I apologize for interrupting|your regular programs...
{14947}{15019}...but I have a very important|announcement to make.
{15031}{15105}Many important things have happened|to me in my life:
{15117}{15171}My graduation from Princeton...
{15183}{15267}...the day that Marsha said|she would be my wife...
{15271}{15325}...the birth of our daughter Taffy.
{15329}{15353}Thanks, Dad.
{15355}{15467}And the news that I have heard today|ranks right up there.
{15473}{15527}A powerful memory is in the making.
{15543}{15585}Not just for me...
{15589}{15633}...but for all mankind.
{15640}{15664}Today...
{15665}{15751}...an extraordinary discovery|was made by the Hubble telescope.
{15802}{15872}The data from the Hubble was decoded...
{15892}{16003}...then analyzed by the most|powerful computers at MIT.
{16018}{16072}The images are undeniable.
{16084}{16160}We are entering the dawn of a new era.
{16188}{16280}Frame enlargements provide|an astonishing sight.
{16286}{16396}A fleet of vehicles,|which can best be described as...
{16402}{16440}...flying saucers.
{16444}{16520}Come on! Come on!|Papa needs a new pair of shoes!
{16592}{16656}Hey, am I the only one|shooting craps here?
{16660}{16749}We hope we will have the chance|to meet with them.
{16753}{16819}This is the perfect summation|to the 20th Century....
{16821}{16855}Martians.
{16869}{16915}This is great.
{16925}{16991}Please, come to Earth. Please.
{17007}{17039}We need you.
{17139}{17189}I got people coming in!
{17193}{17261}Everybody wants to be part of this.
{17263}{17331}Galaxy's going to be world class.
{17357}{17389}And soon...
{17393}{17465}...we will become one solar system.
{17477}{17509}What the hell's he talking about?
{17511}{17573}These flying saucers|have come from Mars...
{17615}{17677}...and at their current course and speed...
{17685}{17725}...will enter Earth's orbit in 16 hours.
{17727}{17821}I've been thinking about Martians|when there weren't any.
{17831}{17941}It is profoundly moving to know|there is intelligent life out there.
{17945}{17981}Glad it's somewhere.
{17983}{18075}Our world|will never feel quite the same again.
{18113}{18143}Good night...
{18167}{18212}...and God bless you all.
{18465}{18497}This...
{18519}{18557}...is intense.
{18621}{18671}Shut up, Poppy. Shut up.
{18697}{18729}Shut up!
{18745}{18774}Jason Stone.
{18843}{18873}It's for you.
{18917}{18977}Poppy, honey. No, sweetie.
{19017}{19069}That's right. Good girl.
{19163}{19202}I could be there at...
{19217}{19265}...I don't know, 11:00.
{19635}{19719}They want me to interview|the professor from the White House.
{19735}{19760}Kessler?
{19799}{19825}Donald Kessler?
{19827}{19876}Yeah, I think that was his name.
{19896}{19929}You know, the science guy.
{19931}{19975}This is nuts, this is....
{19983}{20029}We should have got that guy.
{20039}{20091}Your people are too slow.
{20123}{20153}Right, Poppy?
{20725}{20749}Finished!
{20751}{20795}One minute, 57 seconds.
{20831}{20885}-Didn't I tell you under two minutes?|-You did!
{20887}{20911}You did!
{20913}{20939}Hot damn.
{20957}{20990}Want a doughnut?
{20997}{21023}How old are they?
{21025}{21059}Fresh baked, Monday.
{21061}{21125}Richie, that's six days ago!
{21137}{21171}Give me a couple.
{21261}{21319}This Martian thing is pretty awesome.
{21323}{21413}Did one of you traitors see my Muffy?
{21417}{21459}Your brother's volunteering.
{21461}{21513}As soon as I get back to the base.
{21515}{21545}Volunteer for what?
{21547}{21583}Martian detail.
{21609}{21629}Cool.
{21631}{21717}lf any Martians come around here,|I'll kick their butts!
{22015}{22039}Jump!
{22268}{22328}Folks,|we must make an unscheduled stop!
{22409}{22437}It's Mama.
{22455}{22533}Why are you here?|lf you ain't home, why ain't you in class?
{22535}{22561}Class was cancelled.
{22563}{22597}It was not!
{22601}{22625}-Come here!|-Why?
{22627}{22670}I'm not going to hurt you.
{22681}{22711}Let go of him.
{22749}{22807}Okay. Now just come here.
{22815}{22845}Come here.
{22875}{22915}Think it's smart to cut school?
{22917}{22963}-What are you doing?|-Do you?
{22987}{23015}No, it's dumb.
{23017}{23061}You'll flunk! Go to jail!
{23065}{23109}Get on the bus!
{23113}{23139}Get on!
{23145}{23205}I'll be tripping on you. Get back there.
{23209}{23247}I don't want to hear anymore.
{23249}{23275}I hate school.
{23277}{23307}I heard that!
{23879}{23905}Hi, there.
{23907}{23935}Want a date?
{23939}{23973}How about it?
{23979}{24011}A date?
{24067}{24098}It sounds good.
{24151}{24195}The stress at work is...
{24203}{24241}...unbelievable.
{24372}{24414}May I speak to you in private?
{24416}{24483}No, I must watch the floor.|What do you want?
{24495}{24582}-I'm supporting a family back east.|-I thought you were divorced.
{24584}{24651}I am, but I still have to take care of them.
{24672}{24747}Things have been a little lean around here.
{24751}{24798}I was wondering if I could get a raise?
{24800}{24829}Out of the question.
{24831}{24908}I'm an asset to this hotel.|They like me around here.
{24912}{24952}You're a nice guy.
{24960}{25052}But I can get Leon Spinks|or Buster Douglas for the same money.
{25063}{25132}You better get moving.|You're on in five minutes.
{25352}{25412}This show's going to get a great rating.
{25431}{25462}It's all yours.
{25484}{25603}ln certain circumstances the proposition|that two and two equals five...
{25607}{25651}...is entirely legitimate.
{25692}{25726}Call me Nathalie.
{25736}{25803}And you, do please call me Donald.
{25836}{25872}I admire your show.
{25931}{25991}Really? You like my work?
{26000}{26047}Yes. Very much.
{26051}{26083}Why....
{26096}{26139}Thank you.
{26143}{26185}Coming out of commercial.
{26187}{26228}In five...four...
{26232}{26272}...three...two....
{26274}{26356}Welcome back.|We're with Professor Donald Kessler.
{26403}{26479}He's the chairman|of the American Academy...
{26483}{26540}...of Astronautics.
{26568}{26600}Professor...
{26607}{26688}...isn't it weird that we sent|a space probe to Mars...
{26692}{26742}...and we didn't even find anyone?
{26744}{26792}Well, not really...
{26796}{26825}...Nathalie.
{26836}{26892}We didn't get into the canals.
{26896}{26945}The Martian canals are canyons.
{26951}{27003}Some are over 100 miles deep.
{27008}{27124}The Martian civilization has clearly|developed under the planet's surface.
{27132}{27217}Their science and technology|must be absolutely mind-boggling.
{27236}{27258}So...
{27260}{27308}...what in your view, Donald...
{27324}{27350}...Kessler...
{27352}{27455}...Chairman, are some of the things|the Martians can teach us, Professor?
{27515}{27575}Quite a lot about Mars, Nathalie.
{27663}{27694}She's flirting.
{27700}{27780}But seriously,|this is tremendously exciting.
{27785}{27859}The knowledge, the new ideas:|it'll change everything.
{27869}{27915}And we must be open to it.
{27919}{27981}Maybe they can tell us about our universe.
{27983}{28015}How it started.
{28019}{28055}Where it's going.
{28059}{28113}Perhaps even its purpose.
{28131}{28169}It's tremendously exciting.
{28171}{28235}It's the most important event since...
{28243}{28297}...Jesus walked in Galilee--
{28313}{28341}Christ.
{28345}{28385}What's wrong?
{28389}{28419}Go to Camera Two!
{28421}{28455}I can't. It's busted.
{28457}{28501}Go to One! Go to Four!
{28659}{28693}He copped a feel.
{28755}{28783}Now what?
{29105}{29134}What's that?
{29139}{29177}So that's a Martian.
{29255}{29289}That's a Martian?
{29379}{29415}Oh, my God!
{29419}{29442}Yikes!
{29505}{29562}I'm not having that thing in my house.
{29599}{29631}Sweetie...
{29635}{29703}...we may have to.|The people expect me to meet them.
{29705}{29767}They're not eating off the Van Buren china.
{29813}{29849}Look at that brain.
{29863}{29901}He must be real smart.
{29905}{29953}It's gross!
{29971}{30013}Don't forget, Nathalie...
{30017}{30079}...that we will look equally gross to him.
{30199}{30251}He made the international sign|of the doughnut.
{30265}{30369}From the limited information available,|I've made three extrapolations. One:
{30373}{30441}Our Martian friend|is a carbon-based life form.
{30445}{30497}Two: He breathes nitrogen.
{30501}{30527}And three:
{30529}{30601}The large cerebrum here, indicates...
{30613}{30659}...telepathic potential.
{30669}{30705}You mean they can...
{30707}{30745}...read our thoughts?
{30783}{30819}Potentially, yes.
{30823}{30875}What about their intentions?
{30879}{30919}Are they friendly people?
{30921}{31037}Logic dictates that given|their high level of technical development...
{31045}{31091}...they're an advanced culture.
{31093}{31161}Therefore, peaceful and enlightened.
{31181}{31237}The human race, on the other hand...
{31247}{31319}...is an aggressively dangerous species.
{31341}{31415}Now I suspect they have|more to fear from us...
{31419}{31457}...than we from them.
{31477}{31501}Doctor.
{31511}{31538}Thank you.
{31565}{31657}For many years,|I've been refining a translating computer.
{31679}{31749}The results are not perfect, but this...
{31753}{31809}...may answer some of your questions.
{31948}{31986}Green skin...
{32004}{32056}...800 centuries ago.
{32066}{32104}Their bodily fluids...
{32108}{32168}...include the birth of half-breeds.
{32178}{32215}How many centuries did he say?
{32217}{32241}Eight hundred, sir.
{32243}{32298}Self-determination of the cosmos.
{32322}{32384}For dark is the suede that...
{32388}{32416}...mows...
{32422}{32472}...like a harvest.
{32486}{32533}What the hell does that mean?
{32894}{32922}Hey, Mitch.
{32924}{32955}Good morning.
{32958}{33044}I'm sorry, you can't come this way.|There's a tour in progress.
{33260}{33303}Hello, my name is Barbara.
{33305}{33345}Hello, Barbara.
{33361}{33461}I am an alcoholic,|but I haven't had a drink in three months.
{33620}{33700}I'm feeling so optimistic|because of the Martians.
{33716}{33774}We're not alone in the universe.
{33782}{33830}And it's so perfect...
{33834}{33919}...that it's happening at the beginning|of the new millennium.
{33924}{33970}Our planet was suffering...
{33974}{34056}...with the ozone and the rain forest and...
{34094}{34170}...so many people unhappy in their lives.
{34188}{34216}And then...
{34232}{34318}...the Martians heard|our global karmic cry for help.
{34332}{34368}People say they're ugly...
{34370}{34436}...but I think they've come|to show us the way.
{34486}{34542}I think they've come to save us.
{34613}{34640}Thank you.
{34944}{34970}Bye-bye.
{34972}{35042}You be careful. Don't get yourself killed.
{35046}{35080}Ain't she cute?
{35084}{35142}-We're real proud of you.|-Thanks, Dad.
{35174}{35208}Let me take this.
{35244}{35340}So long, retard. Don't touch|any of my stuff while I'm gone.
{35390}{35424}Bye-bye, Grandma.
{35428}{35458}Good-bye, Thomas.
{35460}{35494}It's Billy-Glenn, Grandma.
{35496}{35534}I know, Thomas.
{35580}{35612}Bye-bye, honey.
{35648}{35684}I must go.
{36000}{36037}Take care of my boy.
{36304}{36332}He'll be all right.
{36334}{36361}I hope so.
{36363}{36402}Army trains them good.
{36532}{36570}He's gone for a while.
{36590}{36650}Why can't you be more like your brother?
{36654}{36756}We got lucky with Billy-Glenn.|You can't expect the same luck twice.
{36770}{36846}Richie, want to make yourself useful|for a change?
{36850}{36876}Sure, Dad.
{36878}{36926}Take Grandma back to the home.
{37262}{37345}I bet you never thought you'd live|to see the Martians come.
{37356}{37402}It's pretty far out.
{37452}{37540}But think of all the crazy things|you must have seen.
{37552}{37636}I bet people were pretty scared|when they invented the train.
{37650}{37716}Come on, kid, I'm not that old!
{37800}{37830}Are you okay?
{37870}{37908}I want to see Slim.
{37912}{37944}I want to see...
{37948}{37978}...Slim...
{37982}{38014}...and Muffy...
{38024}{38056}...and Richie.
{38128}{38165}Grandma, I'm Richie.
{38202}{38248}I know, Thomas.
{38256}{38318}Richie was always the best one.
{38413}{38492}Right now the president|is talking to other world leaders.
{38494}{38580}They're preparing a list of issues|of common interest to discuss.
{38582}{38688}There is a unilateral, concerted,|diplomatic effort being made.
{38748}{38766}Jason.
{38768}{38786}Thanks.
{38788}{38880}lf the Martians land,|can the press do interviews?
{38900}{38936}Well, that depends.
{38938}{38990}We must establish contact...
{38994}{39046}...work out communication problems...
{39048}{39080}...establish parameters.
{39082}{39140}Then I guess we just see what happens.
{39148}{39186}Here's the president.
{39242}{39274}Good morning.
{39278}{39334}It's nice to see you all again.
{39338}{39428}I just have a few minutes for questions,|so let's get started.
{39432}{39462}Mr. President!
{39532}{39608}Do the Martians have two sexes,|like we do?
{40038}{40068}From Hollywood...
{40070}{40154}...we bring you the ''Lawrence Welk Show''!
{40280}{40384}Here he is, Mr. Music Maker himself,|Lawrence Welk.
{40606}{40698}This pussycat|is the most beautiful pussycat...
{40702}{40756}...in the whole world.
{40760}{40800}That's my Muffy.
{40916}{40984}Didn't you ever have|a pussycat of your own?
{40988}{41018}Sure, Grandma.
{41024}{41066}Music!
{41192}{41222}There you go.
{41334}{41376}You going to be okay?
{41398}{41494}lf you need anything,|any doughnuts or anything, call me.
{42123}{42155}How do?
{42185}{42267}Looks like you ain't got no wheels.|Come on...
{42275}{42309}...get in.
{42421}{42473}I'm going to do you a favor.
{42477}{42503}I owe you one.
{42505}{42603}I made a ton of money|on your last fight in '73.
{42607}{42646}The Quaker in Jamaica.
{42665}{42703}I'm glad somebody did.
{42707}{42757}Yeah, I know, I know.
{42761}{42798}It's rough on jocks.
{42811}{42855}You get to a certain age...
{42860}{42904}...opportunities dry up.
{42929}{42971}So here's the deal.
{42975}{43075}I got this chum, owes me a lot of money,|needs a wake-up call.
{43077}{43131}What I'd like you to do is...
{43135}{43205}...use that patented left hook on him.
{43227}{43297}Just in the ring, Art. Just in the ring.
{43301}{43361}Yeah, I'm hip, I'm hip, but...
{43375}{43423}...I'll give you two grand.
{43449}{43487}When you're done...
{43491}{43589}...all you must do is mosey on|by the office and get the cash.
{43595}{43645}Why do you want to come at me that way?
{43647}{43703}I'm trying to get back with my wife.
{43707}{43765}We had problems with this kind of shit.
{43785}{43827}But I've changed, man.
{43833}{43859}I found Allah...
{43861}{43921}...I don't eat pork, I'm a better man.
{43947}{44021}I faced that demon|and I don't want him coming again.
{44075}{44123}You gave up pork!
{44296}{44342}They're sending coordinates.
{44485}{44511}Where are they landing?
{44513}{44566}Pahrump. It's in the Nevada desert.
{44568}{44644}I can have my troops there at 0800 hours,|sir.
{44649}{44737}We must not send these people|the wrong message.
{44741}{44792}We need a welcome mat, not tanks!
{44796}{44905}What are you talking about? You can't|have Martians running all over Nevada!
{44909}{44939}You're right.
{44941}{45010}-Thank you, sir.|-This situation needs to be supervised.
{45012}{45048}Absolutely, sir.
{45052}{45088}General Casey...
{45093}{45133}...can you handle it?
{45149}{45175}I'd be proud.
{45177}{45236}Good, but keep a lid on it.
{45240}{45309}Key media, good cross-section of guests.
{45329}{45396}We don't want it to turn|into a zoo out there.
{45620}{45682}They don't know what|they're talking about!
{45684}{45737}Liberals, intellectuals...
{45741}{45797}...peacemongers, idiots!
{45837}{45893}Would you please keep it down?
{45897}{45937}People live here!
{46514}{46544}General Casey.
{46581}{46657}Yes, I get to greet the Martian ambassador.
{46669}{46709}Isn't that great?
{46713}{46782}Oh, it's a hell of an honor.
{46793}{46902}Didn't I always tell you if I stayed|in place and never spoke up...
{46906}{46965}...good things were bound to happen?
{48573}{48658}I want the Martians to be treated|like foreign dignitaries.
{48662}{48725}I want your men alert and majestic...
{48729}{48789}...with a snap in their step.
{48818}{48882}This must look good.|The world is watching.
{48884}{48910}Yes, sir.
{49034}{49091}Are you positive this thing will work?
{49117}{49158}Positively positive.
{49162}{49200}We don't want any slip-ups.
{49202}{49253}No, no, no, no. Not at all.
{49769}{49836}Poppy. All these people.
{49856}{49913}All of them here to see you.
{49980}{50024}There's Jason, Poppy!
{50332}{50368}Okay, let's go.
{50421}{50502}The teeming masses have gathered|from who knows how many states...
{50504}{50548}...waiting and watching.
{50553}{50586}Why have they come?
{50588}{50645}Curiosity? Or is it something more?
{50653}{50718}Or simply to say, 'I was there'?
{50729}{50762}'I was there...
{50766}{50804}'...when first man...
{50806}{50842}'...met Martian.'
{50857}{50879}Jason Stone...
{50881}{50913}...GNN...
{50917}{50942}...Pahrump.
{51734}{51762}Some room.
{51766}{51809}Give them room.
{53053}{53106}It is an awesome sight.
{53110}{53181}The giant spacecraft glinting...
{53185}{53249}...in the Nevada sun like a...
{53265}{53297}...giant...
{53309}{53345}...hubcap.
{53385}{53425}Something's happening.
{53561}{53594}The doorway...
{53598}{53628}...is opening.
{53729}{53774}A silver ramp...
{53778}{53814}...is coming out...
{53837}{53881}...like a giant tongue.
{54458}{54498}Gee whiz.
{55177}{55209}Martians!
{55233}{55274}Funny little critters.
{56206}{56234}Well?
{56257}{56279}Wait.
{56369}{56396}Greetings.
{56401}{56461}I am the Martian ambassador.
{56521}{56585}Everything is fixed now. You may speak.
{56589}{56621}Greetings.
{56625}{56663}I am General Casey...
{56665}{56777}...Commanding Officer of the Armed|Forces of the United States of America.
{56786}{56849}On behalf of the people of Earth:
{56853}{56878}Welcome.
{56898}{56932}He did that well.
{57658}{57694}We come in peace.
{57714}{57766}We come in peace. We come in peace.
{57884}{57936}They came in peace.
{58012}{58052}We come in peace.
{58756}{58782}Open fire!
{59540}{59568}What?
{60758}{60818}Die, you alien shithead!
{60976}{61005}I surrender!
{61188}{61250}No, it ain't happening! It didn't happen!
{62613}{62665}Holy Mother of God!
{62681}{62716}Did you see that?
{62720}{62803}We should hit these assholes|with everything we've got, sir.
{62817}{62854}Sir, Mr. President,|I know this seems terrible...
{62856}{62903}...but let's not be too rash.
{62905}{62942}We should nuke them!
{62953}{63020}We must establish|a line of communication first.
{63036}{63077}Set up a town hall.
{63081}{63130}We'll get the public's opinion.
{63177}{63220}What do you think?
{63261}{63304}Kick the crap out of them.
{63340}{63379}Ladies and gentlemen...
{63381}{63442}...it may be a cultural misunderstanding.
{63460}{63508}Maybe to them, doves mean war.
{63554}{63626}We all saw how they reacted to that dove.
{63634}{63670}It frightened them.
{63680}{63732}He did say that...
{63780}{63832}...''We come in peace.''
{64068}{64118}The new computer's ready.
{64122}{64170}Okay, let's do it.
{64174}{64236}I know we're making the right decision.
{64308}{64344}Ready to transmit.
{64394}{64484}This is the president of the United States.
{64506}{64550}I'm speaking in the hope...
{64554}{64635}...that what happened earlier today|in the Nevada desert...
{64644}{64720}...was a cultural misunderstanding.
{64740}{64810}There can be no doubt|that we two peoples...
{64814}{64892}...have a great deal to offer one another.
{64896}{64944}You must be as excited as we...
{64948}{65025}...to find intelligent life in the solar system.
{65052}{65098}Let me make it clear.
{65102}{65142}You have nothing...
{65146}{65194}...to fear from us.
{65204}{65280}Our customs may be strange to you...
{65284}{65348}...but we mean no harm.
{67074}{67136}When the investors fly in...
{67148}{67212}...I would like for them each to be...
{67244}{67280}...met by a limo.
{67304}{67362}Top of the line cars...
{67376}{67432}...leather interiors...
{67446}{67504}...Corinthian, if they got it.
{67524}{67606}Are you still spinning your wheels|on that cockamamie hotel?
{67640}{67670}Hello!
{67686}{67734}The Martians have attacked!
{67738}{67836}This was no misunderstanding.|I was there. I saw it.
{67840}{67898}Look, you're worried about yesterday.
{67906}{67954}I'm worried about tomorrow.
{67958}{68044}The Martians land on Earth,|they'll need a place to stay.
{68048}{68089}Just like everyone else.
{68108}{68144}My God.
{68176}{68242}Maybe we should all be destroyed.
{68266}{68342}The human race doesn't deserve to live.
{68510}{68538}Ethel...
{68542}{68584}...that reminds me.
{68588}{68646}I'd like the limos to be stocked...
{68650}{68724}...with every kind of alcohol|known to man.
{68728}{68794}And top it off with a bottle of Dom...
{68798}{68834}...on ice.
{68858}{68936}What confounds me most of all|is the lack of genitalia.
{68940}{68986}Down here is the aorta.
{68990}{69050}Up here we have the sphinx.
{69058}{69134}Notice the highly developed|nerve system here.
{69138}{69222}This explains, of course,|the cerebral arteries.
{69226}{69314}And if we notice down here,|behind the optic chiasm...
{69332}{69382}...several glands....
{69472}{69516}Very curious.
{70538}{70648}''He who believes in me,|though he die, yet shall he live.
{70670}{70766}''And whoever lives and believes in me|shall never die.''
{70794}{70874}Billy-Glenn Norris gave his life|defending our country.
{70878}{70924}Why did it have to be him?
{70928}{71024}He's a true American hero.|May God rest his soul.
{71064}{71108}Ready! Aim.
{71146}{71170}Fire!
{71204}{71230}Aim!
{71238}{71264}Fire!
{71568}{71597}Hello?
{71601}{71682}Byron! Is everything all right?|You still coming tomorrow?
{71684}{71768}Just try and stop me.|That plane arrives at 4:00 p.m.
{71773}{71809}Are the kids there?
{71813}{71845}Yeah, hold on.
{71921}{71961}-Me first.|-No, me.
{72048}{72067}Hey, Dad.
{72069}{72117}Who's that? Neville?
{72133}{72157}How are you?
{72159}{72205}We're going to the White House.
{72207}{72245}The White House?
{72249}{72279}Yeah, tomorrow.
{72283}{72331}-Give it back!|-Leave me alone.
{72335}{72389}It's a school thing, like a tour.
{72393}{72463}So you're still going to school|once in a while?
{72499}{72533}Give me your ma again.
{72535}{72559}Hold on.
{72561}{72581}Mom.
{72587}{72653}-You always get to the phone first.|-So what?
{72669}{72707}I'm first to the game.
{72757}{72831}Why are you wasting this phone time?|I'll see you tomorrow.
{72833}{72895}But there's something|I want to say to you.
{72899}{72957}Just 'cause I feel like saying it.
{72963}{72992}What's that?
{73009}{73043}I love you.
{73087}{73131}I love you too, Byron.
{73135}{73209}Now stop wasting money!|I'll see you tomorrow!
{73629}{73665}They're responding.
{73745}{73793}A message from the Martians.
{73851}{73873}Really?
{73875}{73925}They've issued a formal apology.
{73971}{74021}This is great!
{74039}{74085}I told you this would happen.
{74089}{74189}The Martian ambassador feels terrible|and wants to speak to Congress.
{74193}{74231}That's good, isn't it?
{74235}{74271}You bet.
{74285}{74341}It's a victory for our administration.
{76129}{76167}Ladies and gentlemen.
{76171}{76245}This is a proud day for all Americans.
{76259}{76337}This is a hell of a photo-op, Jerry.
{76351}{76403}Are you sure I shouldn't be there?
{76407}{76497}The Secret Service don't want|the executive branch...
{76501}{76575}...and the legislative branch|in the same room.
{76601}{76673}The Martian ambassador|is going to say a few words.
{76687}{76739}Come on down, Mr. Ambassador!
{78371}{78412}Mr. Ambassador, please!
{78551}{78575}Please!
{78581}{78627}This doesn't make sense!
{78631}{78679}It's not logical! It's not--
{78727}{78769}Guess it wasn't the dove.
{78815}{78837}Fire!
{78977}{79025}They blew up Congress!
{79555}{79605}Why'd they do that?
{79610}{79679}Maybe they don't like the human being.
{80110}{80146}Hello, gentlemen.
{80150}{80202}Nice of you to come on...
{80206}{80250}...such short notice.
{80272}{80308}General Decker...
{80312}{80370}...it seems I owe you an apology.
{80376}{80440}We all make mistakes, Mr. President.
{80444}{80490}Not anymore.
{80498}{80574}We're going to take charge of this thing!
{80580}{80637}Excellent. I have prepared the order.
{80654}{80682}What's this?
{80684}{80764}Your executive order for full use|of our nuclear deterrent.
{80852}{80914}Are you crazy? I'm not starting a war!
{80918}{81016}We're already at war, sir! We have|to nuke them! We must nuke them now!
{81046}{81128}General Decker, if you do not shut up...
{81138}{81192}...I'll relieve you of your command.
{81196}{81240}We must strike now, sir!
{81244}{81292}Annihilate! Kill! Kill!
{81304}{81328}Shut up!
{81332}{81386}Shut up! Shut up!
{82002}{82030}Now...
{82074}{82134}...I want the people to know...
{82138}{82216}...that they still have two out of three|branches of government...
{82218}{82282}...working for them, and that ain't bad.
{82286}{82404}I want the people to know|that the schools will still be open, okay?
{82418}{82474}And I want the people to know...
{82478}{82552}...that the garbage will still be carried out.
{82556}{82596}And I want a cop...
{82600}{82634}...on every corner.
{82636}{82680}Which, incidentally...
{82684}{82740}...we would already have...
{82744}{82816}...if they had listened to me|in the last election.
{82892}{82924}Jerry...
{82928}{82980}...how soon can we go on the air?
{83112}{83172}My fellow Americans.
{83184}{83236}It is with a heavy heart...
{83240}{83298}...that I speak to you this afternoon.
{83302}{83332}As you know...
{83334}{83452}...earlier today the Martian ambassador|and his confederates...
{83458}{83500}...attacked and killed...
{83504}{83604}...many of your representatives|on Capitol Hill.
{83618}{83730}I will be conferring|with other world leaders as time goes on.
{83748}{83842}And rest assured that, working together...
{83852}{83916}...we will soon come out...
{83938}{84008}...at a very real outcome.
{84062}{84096}Thank you.
{84792}{84834}Nathalie, is that you?
{84852}{84882}Yes.
{84886}{84914}How're you?
{84963}{85013}Not terribly good, I'm afraid.
{85058}{85100}May I ask you a question?
{85168}{85206}Of course you can.
{85234}{85292}Were you flirting with me on the show?
{85298}{85326}Because...
{85332}{85366}...if you were...
{85368}{85412}...I just want you to know...
{85414}{85458}...that I liked it.
{85494}{85524}You did?
{85528}{85552}Really?
{85554}{85636}Because, you know,|I've watched you on TV quite a bit and...
{85638}{85671}...well, I've...
{85682}{85754}...had something of|a schoolboycrush on you for...
{85758}{85788}...oh, gosh...
{85792}{85822}...ages.
{86808}{86835}Hi, there.
{86840}{86898}Are you interested in the White House?
{87022}{87082}I work there. I'm the press secretary.
{87086}{87114}Jerry Ross.
{87132}{87175}Have you ever heard of me?
{87214}{87277}You wouldn't believe|the pressure of my job.
{87318}{87370}It's nice to see a new face.
{87556}{87590}Are you doing anything?
{87592}{87642}'Cause if you want, I...
{87646}{87695}...could give you a personalized tour.
{87697}{87734}Would you like that?
{87791}{87865}Hey, Mitch, it's me. Can you let me in?
{87957}{88011}Hello, Mr. Ross. Sure.
{88015}{88075}We're a little nervous here,|after what happened.
{88077}{88103}Exactly.
{88327}{88397}Many great men and women|have passed through here.
{88411}{88463}Now we're passing through here.
{88475}{88525}Feels good, don't it?
{88605}{88649}You're very graceful.
{88667}{88697}I like that.
{88881}{88909}Come here.
{89401}{89451}We call this the Kennedy Room.
{89555}{89595}Pretty nifty, huh?
{90393}{90423}So...
{90427}{90465}...how about a drink?
{91187}{91233}Getting more comfortable.
{91289}{91323}Outstanding.
{91671}{91709}How's my lady doing?
{91957}{92007}Oh, missy, you're hot.
{92025}{92083}Could we get that gum out of your mouth?
{92241}{92273}My finger!
{92397}{92465}Hello! Hello, operator?|This is an emergency!
{92469}{92495}Help!
{94553}{94581}Don't shoot!
{94689}{94727}Don't worry, darling.
{94939}{94965}Get down!
{95213}{95247}Thank you, Mitch.
{95251}{95280}It's my job.
{96581}{96603}What's happening?
{96605}{96687}They appear to be|in a highly agitated state.
{96691}{96749}And I, I don't know.
{96765}{96803}I honestly don't know.
{96807}{96879}I don't know what's going on anymore.|This is frustrating.
{96881}{96922}I'm not feeling myself.
{96931}{96981}lf only I could hold you in my arms!
{96983}{97021}Oh, Donald!
{97025}{97064}I'm scared!
{97883}{97909}Excuse me.
{97913}{97981}You said you wanted to know|as soon as possible.
{97985}{98011}What is it?
{98013}{98043}It's NO2.
{98047}{98089}Highly concentrated.
{98093}{98125}Nitrogen.
{98137}{98169}So...
{98175}{98247}...that's how it could breathe|in our atmosphere.
{98267}{98311}What's that noise?
{99078}{99154}But, Theodore,|I simply do not feel that Lincoln....
{99164}{99204}It's a full-scale invasion.
{99206}{99248}We must get you to safety.
{99390}{99420}Not this way?
{99422}{99482}I'm sorry, there's a tour going through.
{99496}{99592}The Blue Room is often considered|the most beautiful in the White House.
{99596}{99672}It is often used by the president|to receive guests.
{99692}{99764}It is furnished to represent|the period of James Monroe.
{99766}{99795}What's that?
{99805}{99837}That...
{99841}{99903}...is a portrait of James Monroe.
{101147}{101183}We lost Taffy!
{101293}{101379}Keep moving,|we must get you to the back stairs!
{101535}{101581}The Nancy Reagan chandelier!
{102036}{102108}What are you gawking at?|Get that president out of here!
{102261}{102309}I personally guarantee...
{102319}{102402}...that you will get a complete return|on your investment...
{102405}{102453}...within five months.
{102457}{102503}Mr. Land, excuse me.
{102507}{102585}Just a second, Sheik Rakula.
{102633}{102651}Now...
{102653}{102753}...even in a time of so-called|intergalactic emergency...
{102781}{102813}...the people...
{102817}{102881}...still want to roll them bones!
{102917}{102953}I believe--
{102965}{103009}Just five more minutes.
{103031}{103103}What I'd like for you to do is to...
{103107}{103187}...view our new,|state-of-the-art show room.
{103219}{103275}It is out-of-sight!
{103313}{103340}Gentlemen.
{103437}{103485}There is no way...
{103489}{103533}...that we can lose.
{104617}{104697}''It's not unusual to be loved by anyone
{104741}{104827}''It's not unusual to have fun with anyone
{104863}{104949}''But when I see you hanging|about with anyone
{104994}{105058}''It's not unusual to see me cry
{105104}{105152}''I want to die''
{105172}{105216}I've called you all day.
{105220}{105254}The flight's been canceled.
{105256}{105316}Byron, there's Martians everywhere!
{105338}{105361}Hello?
{105400}{105434}I can't hear you!
{105569}{105611}I must get to Washington.
{105733}{105776}Do you know anyone who can fly a plane?
{105778}{105806}Your husband, Art.
{105808}{105834}He's dead.
{105838}{105875}I told him this would happen.
{105877}{105929}I loaded the plane with supplies.
{105936}{106040}I want to go to the Tahoe caves.|It's remote, the Martians won't find it.
{106050}{106074}Where's the plane?
{106076}{106142}Private airfield. Other side of the freeway.
{106146}{106188}Will it fly to Washington?
{106192}{106236}I want to go to Tahoe.
{106240}{106284}''You find it happens
{106288}{106340}''All the time
{106354}{106412}''Love will never do
{106428}{106476}''What you want it to
{106498}{106546}''Why can't this crazy love
{106556}{106604}''Be mine''
{106818}{106850}Jesus Christ!
{107067}{107103}Girls, get out!
{107325}{107383}There's a Martian right behind me!
{107387}{107451}You're Tom Jones! ''It Ain't Unusual.''
{107479}{107505}Autograph?
{107507}{107558}Anybody got a pen?
{107993}{108025}Great punch.
{108029}{108063}You'll need that gun.
{108065}{108107}-I'm Tom Jones.|-Byron Williams.
{108109}{108163}I saw you fight in Cardiff, Wales.
{108195}{108223}You okay?
{108233}{108287}-I need a drink.|-You and me both.
{108291}{108339}-We better go.|-Can you fly a plane?
{108341}{108363}Sure. Got one?
{108365}{108391}She has.
{108859}{108925}Don't run, we are your friends.
{109669}{109707}Martians blew up the shop!
{109709}{109731}You're kidding.
{109733}{109759}Should I get Grandma?
{109761}{109845}Forget her! She's halfway|to outer space already! Here!
{109849}{109925}I'll tell you one thing.|They ain't getting the TV!
{110013}{110081}The president of France is on line two.
{110173}{110251}Mr. President, the president of France|is on line two.
{110255}{110299}He says it's important.
{110433}{110485}Hello, Maurice.
{110549}{110589}I have good news.
{110593}{110629}The Martian ambassador is here.
{110631}{110685}We've negotiated a settlement.
{110733}{110789}Maurice get out of the room.
{110793}{110829}Get out, now!
{111923}{111953}Mr. President.
{112011}{112053}Mr. President.
{112057}{112119}I need you to sign this!
{112233}{112269}What is it?
{112273}{112331}My last will and testament?
{112335}{112431}It is an order to deploy|our nuclear capability, sir.
{114153}{114199}What the hell was that?
{116652}{116674}Look!
{116852}{116882}What was that?
{116931}{116957}Where you going?
{116959}{116985}To get Grandma.
{116987}{117034}Stay and defend this trailer!
{117036}{117087}That's what Billy-Glenn would do.
{117091}{117129}You're disgracing a hero!
{117131}{117191}I don't care. I'm gonna go get grandma.
{117207}{117240}Come back here!
{117559}{117601}What in the hell is that?
{117780}{117812}Cut it out!
{117944}{117977}Stop it!
{118191}{118218}-This way!|-No, this way!
{118220}{118279}It's a short cut! The airfield's--
{118283}{118343}Bullshit! The airfield's over there!
{118483}{118577}Being dressed like King Tut|doesn't make you our leader!
{118580}{118616}Look, this is wrong!
{118620}{118712}We're lost! He led us down a maze!|I'm going back to the hotel.
{118716}{118748}-This way!|-Wait!
{118752}{118796}Where are you going?
{118800}{118818}Come on.
{118820}{118856}But, I like him.
{119011}{119115}Assholes! Why'd I listen to them?|I should have stayed in the hotel.
{119129}{119163}Shit!
{119228}{119264}I surrender, okay?
{119276}{119331}You understand what that means?
{119360}{119424}Look! You're intelligent beings.
{119439}{119492}Let's cut a deal. I can help.
{119496}{119531}I'm a lawyer!
{119539}{119621}You want to conquer the world,|you'll need lawyers, right?
{119660}{119684}Here.
{119705}{119744}You want my watch?
{119756}{119820}Take it. Take it. It's a Rolex!
{120072}{120107}Nice shot!
{120111}{120145}Pity I was too late.
{120147}{120192}Can I have the gun back?
{120197}{120243}Give me the gun and come on!
{122036}{122060}Grandma!
{122261}{122292}Oh, my God!
{122631}{122688}I think these guys are very sick.
{122708}{122773}What's happening to them?|What's killing them?
{122808}{122865}I think it must be my music.
{123052}{123086}Quiet!
{124324}{124386}You think you can do anything you want.
{124390}{124424}You can't.
{124428}{124448}Because...
{124450}{124504}...we are human...
{124512}{124536}...beings.
{124538}{124624}And we have the United States Army...
{124648}{124686}...that'll fight you...
{124688}{124786}...to the last man!|And we'll never surrender!
{124878}{124916}Do you hear me?
{124920}{124990}We'll fight you on the beaches.|We'll fight you in the streets.
{124992}{125052}We will never, never surrender!
{125056}{125112}We will win!
{125116}{125160}Democracy will survive!
{125166}{125210}We will never, ever...
{125214}{125252}...surrender!
{125256}{125288}We will win!
{125292}{125340}The eagle will be triumphant!
{126060}{126096}Why...
{126102}{126144}...are you doing this?
{126194}{126222}Why?
{126250}{126316}lsn't the universe big enough...
{126330}{126370}...for both of us?
{126464}{126514}What is wrong with you people?
{126584}{126624}We could work together.
{126652}{126702}Why be enemies?
{126726}{126768}Because we're different?
{126794}{126834}Is that why?
{126934}{126998}Think of the things that we could do.
{127032}{127102}Think how strong we would be!
{127146}{127182}Earth...
{127202}{127248}...and Mars...
{127274}{127304}...together.
{127367}{127435}There is nothing|that we could not accomplish.
{127460}{127502}Think about it!
{127556}{127602}Think about it!
{127638}{127678}Why destroy...
{127698}{127750}...when you can create?
{127782}{127830}We can have it all...
{127850}{127908}...or we can smash it all!
{127992}{128028}Why can't we...
{128034}{128088}...work out our differences?
{128118}{128164}Why can't we...
{128172}{128224}...work things out?
{128284}{128336}Little people...
{128392}{128442}...why can't we all just...
{128472}{128514}...get along?
{129158}{129187}What's this?
{130104}{130166}Don't run. We are your friends.
{130204}{130266}Don't run. We are your friends.
{130589}{130633}Next stop, radio station.
{130703}{130739}There it is!
{130755}{130793}Let's move it!
{131223}{131255}There it is.
{131287}{131337}Go start it. Go with him.
{131341}{131379}Cindy, come with me.
{131793}{131831}Are you sure you can fly this?
{131833}{131873}I think so, yeah.
{131931}{131965}Who put that on?
{131997}{132063}-It's stuck!|-Cindy, over here.
{132219}{132247}Shit!
{132269}{132325}They haven't seen us yet. Come here.
{132375}{132409}Get in the plane.
{132419}{132463}I'll distract them.
{132467}{132521}The first chance you get, go.
{132525}{132577}-I'm not leaving you!|-Just do it!
{132579}{132627}I'll draw them away! Go!
{132631}{132657}No!
{132661}{132695}I said go!
{132809}{132847}Oh, my God!
{132867}{132899}What's he doing?
{132901}{132923}He's flipped!
{132925}{132971}He's going to throw them off|so we can escape.
{132973}{133009}We can't leave him!
{133085}{133111}No weapon!
{133119}{133171}No clown outfit!
{133175}{133205}Just me!
{133219}{133253}Byron Williams...
{133269}{133323}...heavyweight champion...
{133337}{133377}...of the world!
{135072}{135122}Something's happened.
{135129}{135179}Something's happened to Byron.
{135572}{135634}''When I'm calling you
{136152}{136237}''That means I offer my love to you''
{137134}{137168}Good-bye, my darling.
{137170}{137217}I wish things were different.
{137236}{137276}So do I.
{137410}{137442}Good-bye.
{137452}{137478}I love you.
{137480}{137526}I love you too, Nathalie.
{139822}{139860}Florence Norris...
{139864}{139940}...I present to you|the Congressional Medal of Honor...
{139944}{139998}...the nation's highest decoration.
{140044}{140130}Thank you,|but don't you dare let this happen again!
{140166}{140208}Richard Norris...
{140212}{140284}...on behalf of my parents,|who couldn't be here today...
{140286}{140346}...for saving the world from the Martians...
{140348}{140408}...I present to you the Medal of Honor.
{140428}{140478}Don't kiss me if you don't want.
{140488}{140524}I have to.
{140600}{140656}I prepared a speech. Is that okay?
{140674}{140724}Sure, that's very appropriate.
{140840}{140870}Hi, everybody.
{140904}{140934}I want to say--
{140936}{140998}Can you speak up? We can't hear you.
{141010}{141090}I want to say that there's|a lot of people in the world...
{141092}{141162}...that have done a lot more|than I have, and...
{141166}{141218}...they should be here now...
{141224}{141260}...getting a medal.
{141308}{141360}And I want to thank my grandma...
{141364}{141416}...for always being good to me...
{141420}{141490}...and for helping save the world|and everything.
{141518}{141596}So, I guess, like, now we just have to...
{141600}{141696}...start over and start rebuilding|everything, like our houses.
{141700}{141818}But I was thinking, maybe instead|of houses we could live in tepees.
{141826}{141878}Because it's better in many ways.
{141964}{142028}That's all I have to say. Thanks.
{142074}{142104}Was that okay?
{142106}{142132}Yeah.
{142152}{142193}Do you got a girlfriend?
{142198}{142222}No.
{142256}{142330}Give me a break.|Go on in there and clean your room.
{142334}{142398}I can't do this all by myself. Look at you.

Flight 784 for San Francisco
is now ready for boarding at--
Inmate number 87645--
Cole, James.
-Jose, what's going on?
- Bad news, man.
- Volunteers?
- Yeah. And they said your name.
Maybe they'll give you a pardon, man.
Yeah. That's why none of the volunteers come back. They all get a pardon.
Some come back, I heard.
Please put me back!
Don't take me!
They got 'em up on the seventh floor.
They hide 'em up there.
They're all messed up in the head.
You don't know they're all messed up.
Nobody's seen 'em.
And maybe they're not messed up.
That's a rumour. Nobody knows that.
I don't believe that.
Good luck, man.
- Volunteer duty!
- I didn't volunteer.
You causing trouble again?
No, no trouble.
These are the instructions
for the first time probe.
Listen carefully.
They must be followed exactly.
All openings of your garment
must be sealed completely.
If the integrity of the suit
is compromised in any way...
if the fabric is torn
or a zipper not closed...
readmittance will be denied.
If there are any indications
of contamination by germs...
the subject will be denied
re-entry to secure population.
Please place blood sample
in receptacle provided.
There will be a socialization
class in room 700...
for citizens cited
for deviations 23-A and 96-A...
per Subchapter 6
of the Permanent Emergency Code.
James Cole cleared from quarantine.
Thank you.
You two wait outside.
He's got a history, Doctor.
Violence.
Antisocial six.
Repeated violations of the Permanent Emergency Code.
Insolence. Defiance.
Disregard of authority.
Doing 25 to life.
I don't think he's gonna hurt us.
You aren't gonna hurt us, are you, Mr Cole?
No, sir.
Why don't you sit down,
Mr Cole?
We appreciate your volunteering.
You're a very good observer.
- Thank you.
- We have a very advanced programme.
- Something very different.
- A chance to reduce your sentence.
And possibly play an important role... in returning the human race to the surface of the Earth.
We want tough-minded people.
Strong mentally.
We've had some misfortunes with unstable types.
For a man in your position, an opportunity.
Not to volunteer could be a real mistake.
Definitely a mistake.
"Yet among the myriad microwaves... the infrared messages, the gigabytes of ones and zeros... we find words, byte-sized now... tinier even than science... lurking in some vague electricity.
But if we but listen... we hear the solitary voice of that poet telling us... yesterday this day's madness did prepare... tomorrow's silent triumph of despair.
Drink, for you know not whence you came, nor why.
Drink, for you know not why you go, nor where.''
Wandering around in nothing but his underpants... and one of those plastic, see-through lady's raincoats.
So, they get there, they ask the guy real nice for some kind of ID.
He gets agitated, starts screaming about viruses.
Totally irrational, totally disoriented.
Doesn't know where he is, what day of the week it is.
All they got was his name.
They figured he's stoned out of his mind. Some kind of psychotic episode.
- He's been tested for drugs?
- Negative for drugs.
But he took on five cops like he was dusted to the eyeballs.
- No drugs. You believe that?
- He's in restraints.
Yeah. Weren't you listenin'? I've got two police officers in the hospital!
The medic gave him enough Stelazine to kill a horse. He's rarin' to go.
That would explain the bruises, I guess.
The struggle.
Yeah. You wanna go in there, examine him?
Yes, please.
Is this all you have?
Ran it through your system?
No match-up. No licence, no prints, no warrants. Nothing.
- I should probably go in with you.
- No, thank you.
- That won't be necessary.
- All right.
He'll be right here, just in case.
Mr Cole, my name is Kathryn Railly.
I'm a psychiatrist.
I work for the county.
I don't work for the police.
So my concern is for your well-being.
Do you understand that?
Need to go!
Need to go!
I can't make the police let you go.
But I do wanna help you, so l--
I need you to tell me exactly what happened tonight.
Do you think you can do that,James?
May I call you James?
James.
Nobody ever calls me that.
- Have you been a patient at County?
- No.
- Have I seen you someplace?
- Not possible.
I need to go! I'm supposed to be gathering information.
- What kind of information?
- Won't help you.
Won't help anyone.
Won't change anything.
James, do you know why you're here?
'Cause I'm a good observer.
I've got a tough mind.
You don't remember assaulting a police officer?
Why am I chained?
Why are these chains on me?
You've been in an institution before, haven't you?
- Or hospital?
- No! Now I need to go. Need to go!
- Have you been in prison,James?
- Underground.
Hiding?
I love this air.
Oh, it's such wonderful air.
- What's wonderful about the air,James?
- Very fresh. No germs.
Why do you think there aren't any germs in the air?
- This is October, right?
- April.
- What year is this?
- What year do you think it is?
That's the future,James. Do you think you're living in the future?
1996 is the past.
No, 1996 is the future.
This is 1990.
- Shut up, ladies.
- Where're you taking me?
South of France, buddy.
Fancy hotel. You'll love it.
I can't go to France. I just need to make a telephone call.
Yeah, yeah. Zip it, Daisy. You fooled the shrink, but you don't fool us.
Let's go, ace.
All right.
Come on, come on.
There you go.
Now, lemme see your head,Jimbo.
- See if you got any creepy crawlers.
- I need to make a telephone call.
Got to get to a doctor,Jimbo. Can't make no calls till the doctor says.
It's very important!
What you gotta do,Jimbo, is take it easy. Relax into things.
And we'll all get along fine if you just relax.
Let's go.
Come on, let's go.
Hey, Goines!
Yo, Goines!
Yo,Jeffrey!
- What?
- Look here.
This here's James. Now, do me a favour.
Why don't you show him around?
Tell him the TV rules.
Show him the games and stuff. Okay?
How much you gonna pay me?
How much? I'd be doin' your job.
- Five thousand dollars. That enough?
- Five thousand?
I'll wire a cheque to your account as usual.
I'll give him the deluxe mental hospital tour.
Kid around, makes 'em feel good.
We're pals.
You're the prisoners.
No, you're the guards.
Now you got it.
Okay, it's all in good fun.
Here's some games here.
And there's--
Get out! Get out!
He was in my chair.
Games. Games.
Here's some games.
Games that wanna get out.
See? More games.
Games, they vegetize you.
See?
If you play the games, you're voluntarily taking a tranquillizer.
I guess they gave you some chemical restraints. Drugs!
What'd they give you? Thorazine?
Haldol? How much? How much?
Learn your drugs. Know your dosages.
It's elementary.
- I need to make a telephone call.
- A telephone call?
That's communication with the outside world. Doctor's discretion.
If all of these nuts could just make phone calls... it could spread insanity oozing through telephone cables... oozing to the ears of all these poor, sane people, infecting them.
Wackos everywhere.
A plague of madness.
In fact, very few,Jim--Jim, very few of us here are actually mentally ill.
I'm not saying you're not mentally ill.
For all I know, you're crazy as a loon.
But that's not why you're here.
You're here because of the system.
There's the television.
It's all right there.
All right there.
Look, listen, kneel, pray.
The commercials!
We're not productive any more.
Don't make things. It's all automated.
What are we for then?
We're consumers,Jim.
Okay, okay. Buy a lot of stuff, you're a good citizen.
But if you don't buy a lot of stuff, what are you then?
What?
You're mentally ill.
Fact,Jim. Fact! If you don't buy things: toilet paper, new cars... electrically operated sexual devices... stereo systems with brain-implanted headphones... screwdrivers with built-in radar devices, voice-activated computers--
Take it easy,Jeffrey.
Be calm!
Right. That's right.
You're a very attractive woman.
If you want to watch a particular
TV programme, like All My Children... go to the nurse, tell her the day, the time the show you wanna see is on.
But you have to tell her before the show is scheduled to be on.
This guy was always requesting shows that had already played.
Yes. No.
You have to tell her before.
He couldn't grasp the idea that the nurse couldn't make it be yesterday.
She couldn't turn back time!
Thank you, Einstein.
Now he, he was nuts.
He was a fruitcake,Jim.
Okay, that's it,Jeffrey.
You're gonna get a shot.
- I warned you.
- Right.
I got a little carried away... explaining the inner workings of the institution to Jim.
I don't really come from outer space.
Oh. L.J. Washington.
He doesn't really come from outer space.
Don't mock me, my friend.
Get outta my chair!
It's a condition of mental divergence.
I find myself on the planet Ogo.
Part of an intellectual elite... preparing to subjugate the barbarian hordes on Pluto.
But even though this is a totally convincing reality for me in all ways... nevertheless, Ogo is actually a construct of my psyche.
I am mentally divergent... in that I am escaping certain unnamed realities... that plague my life here.
When I stop going there,
I will be well.
Are you also divergent, friend?
This is a place for crazy people.
I'm not crazy.
We don't use that term, " crazy,''
Mr Cole.
You've got some real nuts here!
I know some things that you don't know.
It's gonna be very difficult for you to understand it.
I'm not gonna hurt anyone!
All right.
Look, have any of you heard... of the Army of the Twelve Monkeys?
They stencil this on the sides of buildings everywhere.
Have you seen this?
Have you seen this?
Why don't you just take your time... and try to explain this from the beginning?
Right, right.
It's 1990.
Okay, that makes sense.
They wouldn't have been active yet.
Five billion people died in 1996 and 1997.
Almost the entire population of the world.
Only about one percent of us survived.
- Are you going to save us?
- How can I? This already happened.
I can't save you.
Nobody can.
I am simply trying to gather information to help the people in the present... trace the path of the virus.
We're not in the present now,
Mr Cole?
1990 is the past. This already happened.
That's what I'm trying--
You believe 1996 is the present then, is that it?
No! 1996 is the past too.
Listen to me. What l--
What l-- What I need to do is make a telephone call.
I can straighten this out if I make a telephone call.
Who would you call?
Who would straighten everything out?
The scientists. They'll want to know that they sent me to the wrong time.
I can leave a voice mail message that they monitor from the present.
Can I just make one telephone call, please?
Please?
What are you doin' in the dog bowl?
Get outta there!
Who put those Doritos in there anyway?
Yes? What?
Voice mail?
Look, I don't know--
Stop makin' that noise!
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
Is this a joke?
I don't know any scientists.
Duanne, get out--
James who?
Wasn't who you expected?
No. It was some lady.
She didn't know anything.
Well, maybe it was the wrong number.
No. That's why they chose me.
I remember things.
James, where did you grow up?
Dr Railly.
I have the strangest feeling
I've met you before.
Wait. This is 1990. I'm supposed to be leaving messages in 1996!
It's not the right number yet!
That's the problem!
I have a message for them.
Won't work.
Can't open it.
You think you can remove the grill, but you can't. It's welded.
See? Told you.
All the doors are locked too.
They're protecting the people on the outside from us... when the people on the outside are as crazy as us.
Do you know what " crazy'' is?
Crazy is " majority rules.'' Yeah.
Take germs, for example.
Germs?
In the 18th century, no such thing.
Nada. Nothing.
No one ever imagined such a thing!
No sane person, anyway.
Along comes this doctor.
Semmelweis!
Semmelweis comes along, trying to convince people, other doctors mainly... that there are these teeny, tiny, invisible bad things called germs... that get into your body and make you sick.
He's trying to get doctors to wash their hands.
What is this guy?
Crazy?
Teeny, tiny, invisible--
"What do you call 'em? Germs? What?''
Now, cut to the 20th century.
Last week, in fact, right before
I got dragged into this hellhole!
I go in to order a burger in this fast-food joint.
The guy drops it on the floor.
Jim, he picks it up, wipes it off.
He hands it to me like it was all okay.
"What about the germs?'' I say.
He says, "I don't believe in germs.
Germs are a plot they made up so they can sell you disinfectants and soaps.''
Now, he's crazy, right?
See?
There's no right. There's no wrong.
There's only popular opinion.
You, you, you believe in germs, right?
I'm not crazy.
Of course not! You wanna escape, right?
That's very sane.
I can help you.
You want me to, don't ya? Get you out?
You know how to get outta here?
Yes, my son!
- Then why don't ya?
- Why don't I try to escape?
Good question. Very good question.
Intelligent.
Because I would be crazy to escape.
I have sent out word.
- I am all taken care of.
- What does that mean?
I've managed to contact certain underlings, evil spirits... secretaries of secretaries and other assorted minions... who will contact my father.
And when my father finds out
I'm in this kind of place... he'll have them transfer me to one of those classy joints... where they treat you properly, like a person, a guest!
With sheets and towels like a big hotel... with great drugs for all of us nut-case, lunatic, maniac devils!
Sorry. Sorry.
I got a little agitated.
The thought of escape crossed my mind.
And suddenly--
Suddenly I felt like bending the fucking bars back!
And ripping out the window frames and eating them! Yes, eating them!
And leaping, leaping, leaping!
Colonics for everyone!
I'm a mental patient.
I'm supposed to act out.
Wait'll you morons find out who I am!
My father's gonna be really upset.
And when my father gets upset, the ground shakes.
My father is God!
I worship my father!
These dramatic video tapes, secretly
obtained by animal rights activists...
have aroused public indignation.
But many scientists
vehemently disagree.
Torture experiments.
- We're all monkeys.
- They hurt you?
Not as bad as what they're doing to the Easter Bunny.
Look at them.
They're just askin' for it.
Maybe the human race deserves to be wiped out.
Wiping out the human race?
It's a great idea.
It's great.
But more of a long-term thing.
First we have to focus on more immediate goals.
I didn't say a word about you-know-what.
- What are you talking about?
- Your plan. Emancipation.
What are you writing?
You a reporter?
It's private.
A lawsuit?
You gonna sue 'em?
Yo,Jimbo.
Time for your meds.
Take a chance.
Live the moment.
Sunshine.
Gorgeous beaches.
The Florida Keys!
We'll return you to the Marx Brothers
in Monkey Business.
Monkey business!
Fetch!
Get it?
Monkey. Monk key.
What?
If you see a bearish future
in the decade ahead...
consider the changes sweeping the world
and the opportunities they offer.
" And the opportunities they offer.'' Ooh!
They really dosed you.
Jim!
Major load.
Danger, Will Robinson, danger.
You gotta get it together.
Focus, focus, focus.
Remember the plan.
I did my part!
What?
Not " what.'' When.
- When?
- Yes. When.
Now. Now,Jim.
Yes! Now!
Buy! Sell!
Stocks! Bonds!
Purchase! Sell!
Yes!
No more monkey business!
No... more... monkey business!
Yes, enhance your portfolio now.
Five hundred dollars.
I got $500. I'm insured!
Yeah! A window of opportunity is opening now.
Now is the time for all good men to seize the moment. The moment!
Now is the time for all good men to seize the day!
Goddam it,Jeffrey!
Quit playin' the fool!
MasterCard!
Visa!
The key to happiness!
Jim, seize the moment!
Jeffrey, come back here!
Go,Jim!
- Get out. Out!
- Come here,Jeffrey!
The future can be yours!
Last chance! Last chance!
Best place to go would be Florida.
The Keys are lovely this time of year.
Two's not working today.
Use one.
Kathryn, this was in my box!
But I have a slight suspicion it wasn't meant for me.
"You are the most bootiful woman I have ever seen.
You live in a bootiful world, but you don't know it.
You have freedom, sunshine, air you can breathe--''
James Cole, right?
"I would do anything to stay here but I must leave. Please help me.''
Okay, okay, okay.
Poor man.
Hey, Kathryn?
James Cole is one of yours, right?
He eloped.
Last seen, he was up on two.
Shit!
We have to know exactly what's there so we can fix it.
Doctor, we have a visitor.
May I help you?
Excuse me?
Hey,Jimbo.
What's up, man?
All right, it's okay.
Take it easy.
- It'll be all right.
- Take care.
Take it easy.
We'll work this out, okay?
Send you back to your room. A little milk and cookies, you'll be all right.
Just take it easy, okay?
Calm down!
Take him down!
Take him the fuck down!
I'm not gonna hurt anyone.
Dr Railly, help me, please.
- We'll give you something to calm you.
- No! No more drugs!
James, we have to do this.
You're very confused.
Kathryn, we've been working together for four years.
I've never seen you like this before.
So please stop being so defensive.
This isn't an inquisition.
I didn't think I was being defensive.
I was trying to explain exactly what--
He should've been in restraints.
It was bad judgment on your part, plain and simple. Why not own up to it?
Okay, it was bad judgment. But I have the strangest feeling about him.
- I've seen him before and I'm trying--
- Two policemen are in the hospital.
Now we've got a security guard with a skull fracture.
I said it was bad judgment!
What else do you want me to say?
You see that?
See what I mean?
You're being defensive.
Isn't she being defensive?
We have another situation.
- He was fully restrained?
- Yes, sir. I did it myself.
And he was fully sedated?
He was fully sedated.
Are you trying to tell me a fully sedated, fully restrained patient... somehow slipped out that vent, replaced the grill behind him... and is wriggling his way through the ventilation system?
Watch it!
You sure fucked up!
- Where are you?
- Ah, you can talk!
My name's not Bob.
Not a prob, Bob.
Where'd they send you?
- Where are you?
- Another cell.
Maybe.
What do you mean " maybe''?
What's that supposed to mean?
Maybe means... maybe I'm in the next cell.
Another volunteer like you.
Or maybe I'm in the Central Office... spying on ya for all those science bozos.
Or, hey... maybe I'm not even here.
Maybe I'm just in your head.
No way to confirm anything.
- Where'd they send ya?
'90! How was it?
Good drugs? Lots of pussy?
Hey, Bob, you do the job?
You find out the big info?
Army of the Twelve Monkeys?
It was supposed to be 1996.
Science ain't an exact science with these clowns.
But they're getting better.
You're lucky you didn't end up in ancient Egypt.
Shh! They're comin'.
The Freedom for Animals Association
on Second Avenue...
is the secret headquarters
of the Army of the Twelve Monkeys.
They are the ones
who are going to do it.
I can't do any more.
I have to go now.
Have a merry Christmas.
- Well?
- What?
Did you or did you not record that message?
It's a reconstruction of a deteriorated recording.
Weak signal. We have to put them together one word at a time.
We just finished rebuilding this.
Did you or did you not make this call?
I couldn't make any call. You sent me to the wrong year. It was 1990.
- You're certain of that?
- What'd you do with your time, Cole?
Did you waste it on drugs?
Women?
- They forced me to take drugs.
- Forced you?
Why would someone force you to take drugs?
I was in trouble.
I got arrested.
I did what you wanted.
I got a specimen, a spider.
I didn't have anyplace to put it, so I ate it.
But you sent me to the wrong year, so it really doesn't matter.
Did you see this when you went back?
No, sir, I don't think so.
What about these people?
Did you see any of these people?
No.
Oh, wait, wait.
Him?
You saw that man?
Maybe in the mental institution.
You were in a mental institution?
Oh, God.
Cole, you were sent back to make some very important observations.
You could've made a real contribution.
Helped us to reclaim the planet.
As well as reducing your sentence.
The question is, Cole, do you want another chance?
Last connection going on.
No mistakes this time, Cole.
Stay alert.
Keep your eyes open.
We're thinking about the spider, Cole.
Try and do something like that again.
Just relax now.
Don't fight it.
We're sending you to the third quarter of 1996.
Right on the money.
I don't understand!
What?
I don't understand!
- Where am I?
- I gotta find 'em! I gotta find 'em!
Help me!
I don't know where I am.
- You gotta help me find 'em!
-Jose?
-Jose!
- Cole!
Cole, where are we?
- Help me, Cole!
- Oh, God, wait!
"In a season of great pestilence...
there are omens and divinations.
And one of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels... seven golden vials full of the wrath of God... who liveth forever and ever.''
Revelations.
In the 14th century, according to accounts of officials of that time... this man appeared suddenly in the village of Wyle near Stonehenge... in April of 1362.
Using unfamiliar words and speaking in a strange accent... the man made dire prognostications about a pestilence... which he said would wipe out humanity in approximately 600 years.
Obviously this plague-doomsday scenario is considerably more compelling... when reality supports it with a virulent disease... whether it's the bubonic plague, small pox or AIDS.
Now we have technological horrors as well... such as chemical warfare, which first reared its ugly head... during the deadly mustard gas attacks of World War I.
During such an attack in the French trenches in October of 1917... we have an account of this soldier... who, during an assault, was wounded by shrapnel... and hospitalized, apparently in a state of hysteria.
Doctors found he had lost all comprehension of French... but that he spoke English fluently... albeit in a regional dialect they didn't recognize.
The man, though physically unaffected by the gas... was beside himself.
He claimed that he had come from the future... that he was looking for a pure germ... that would ultimately wipe mankind off the face of the Earth... starting in the year 1996.
Though injured, the young soldier disappeared from the hospital... no doubt trying to carry on his mission to warn others... and substituting for the agony of war... a self-inflicted agony we call "the Cassandra complex."
Cassandra, in Greek legend, was condemned to know the future... but to be disbelieved when she foretold it.
Hence, the agony of foreknowledge, plus the impotence to do anything about it.
I'm going right out to get vaccinated.
I think, Dr Railly, you've given alarmists a bad name.
I have?
There's real data that the planet cannot survive the excesses of the human race.
- This is true.
- Proliferation of atomic devices.
Uncontrolled breeding habits.
Pollution of land, sea and air.
The rape of the environment.
In this context, it's obvious Chicken
Little represents the sane vision... and that Homo sapiens' motto,
"Let's go shopping" ... is the cry of the true lunatic.
Please, Dr Railly. I wonder if you're aware of my own studies.
See you at work tomorrow.
I'll give you a call tomorrow.
Get in the car!
I've got a gun. Get in the car.
Drive.
Take my purse.
I've got a lot of cash, credit cards.
- Take my keys.
- Start the car!
Here, turn right.
Turn right here.
- Where are we going?
- Philadelphia.
- That's more than a hundred miles.
- That's why I can't walk there.
-Just let me go.
-Just drive!
- You can take the car.
- I don't know how to drive.
I went underground when I was eight.
I told you that before.
At the next--
- At the next corner, turn right.
- Cole.James Cole.
You escaped from a locked room six years ago.
Six years for you.
Come on.
Turn around! Get goin'.
I can't believe that this is a coincidence, Mr Cole.
- Have you been following me?
- You said you would help me.
I know this isn't what you meant, but...
I don't have any money.
I hurt my leg.
I've been sleeping on the street.
I'm sure I smell bad.
Do you have any food in this car?
- You have been following me?
- No.
No, I saw this... in a store window.
I can read, remember?
Why do you want to go to Philadelphia?
I checked out the Baltimore information.
It was nothing.
It's in Philadelphia.
That's where the ones who did it are.
The Twelve Monkeys.
Is that a radio?
Can you turn it on?
This is a personal message to you.
Are you at the end of your rope?
Are you dying to get away?
The Florida Keys are waiting for you.
Ocean waves--
I've never seen the ocean.
It's an advertisement, Mr Cole.
What?
It's an advertisement.
You understand that, don't you?
It's not really a special message to you.
Mr Cole.
- You used to call me James.
- You prefer that?
James, you don't really have a gun--
Can you turn this up?
Can you make this louder?
I found my thrill
On Blueberry Hill
When I found you
I love the music of the 20th century.
I love this air.
Love to breathe this air!
WXBX news break.
News as it happens.
Roger Pratt reporting.
A story breaking now is emergency crews
are converging on a corn field...
where playmates of nine-year-old
Ricky Neuman say...
he disappeared before their eyes.
Young Neuman apparently stepped
into an abandoned well shaft...
and is lodged somewhere
in the narrow 150-foot pipe.
Possibly alive, possibly badly injured,
playmates heard him cry out faintly.
- Never cry wolf.
- What?
My father said that to me.
He said, "Never cry wolf."
Then people won't believe you if something really happens.
If something really happens like what,James?
Something bad.
Can we have some more music, please?
I don't wanna hear this stuff.
Can we hear more music?
- I see trees of green
- Oh, that's good. That's good.
I've seen them bloom
For me and you
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world
Hello, Dr Railly?
This is Wikke from Psych Admitting.
Do you rememberJames Cole?
The paranoid who pulled
the Houdini back in '90?
Well, he's back, and he's--
Sorry about that. He's looking for you.
I thought you oughta know.
Take care.
It's just like I told you.
Me and my husband went ahead.
I don't know. She never showed.
That is totally unlike her.
Do you happen to know the make of her car?
Cherokee. '94 Cherokee.
Silver.
I have done " doed" it, ja.
I, Professor Grossenfibber,
have invented the time tunnel!
Oh, boy!
Oh, excuse me, mister.
Have a cigar.
Excuse me, mister.
Have a cigar.
Now my time machine
is ready for experiments.
Ah, the woodpecker!
Yoo-hoo, woodpecker!
You were in my dream just now.
Hair is different.
Different colour.
I'm sure it was you.
What was the dream about?
About an airport... before everything happened.
It's the same dream
I always have.
When I was a kid.
And I was in it?
What did I do?
You were very upset.
You're always very upset in the dream.
Just never knew it was you.
It wasn't me before,James.
It's become me now because of what's happening.
Could you please untie me?
No, I think it was always you.
Very strange.
You're flushed and you were moaning.
I think you're running a fever.
What are you doing?
In Fresno, California, crews continue
to attempt to rescue Ricky Neuman.
Closer to home, in Baltimore,
Kathryn Railly...
prominent psychiatrist and author of
a newly released book on insanity...
disappeared mysteriously last night
after a lecture at the university.
Former mental patient James Cole
is wanted for questioning...
regarding Dr Railly's disappearance.
Authorities warn that Cole
has a history of violence...
and advise anyone spotting him
to notify authorities at once.
I love this music.
We don't have this.
We don't have anything like this.
What are all those?
These?
My notes, clues.
What kind of clues?
It's about the secret army.
The Army of the Twelve Monkeys.
They're the ones that spread the virus.
That's why I'm here.
I have to find them. That's my mission.
Have to locate them because they have the virus in its pure form... before it mutates.
When I locate them, they'll send a scientist back here.
That scientist will study the virus.
When he goes back to the present, he and the scientists will make a cure.
Police officers
from threejurisdictions...
apparently including
special tactical unit personnel...
have now been mobilized to control
the growing thousands of onlookers...
here in Fresno, California.
Does that disturb you?
No. Thought it was about us.
Thought maybe they'd captured us and arrested me.
Just a joke.
I remember being very afraid for that little boy.
All alone, down that well... not knowing if anybody's gonna get him out.
First time I was really afraid when I was a kid.
What do you mean,
"when you were a kid" ?
Never mind.
Just a prank, a hoax.
That boy's hiding in a barn.
"There are omens and divinations.
One of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels... seven golden vials full of the wrath of God... who liveth forever and ever.''
You won't think I'm crazy when people start dying next month.
First they'll think it's just some weird fever.
Then they'll find out.
They'll catch on.
Wait. Stop here! Stop the car!
Stop right here!
I was right. They're here!
You see? Twelve Monkeys!
Twelve Monkeys!
You believe me now?
Come on!
Come on!
They're here, you see?
Twelve Monkeys!
Twelve Monkeys. Come on!
Twelve Monkeys.
Wait, wait. Wait, here.
Here, do you see it?
Do you see?
I see some red paint, some marks.
- Marks? You think that--
- Oh, this is ridiculous.
Don't--
Don't you do anything crazy.
Or I'll hurt somebody.
I am not gonna do anything crazy, but none of this is what you think it is!
You can't hide from them, Bob.
I said, you can't hide from them.
No, sir, ol' Bob.
Don't even try.
They hear everything.
They got that tracking device on ya.
They can find you anywhere, anytime!
It's in the tooth.
Right, Bob?
But I fooled 'em, old buddy.
They don't have to spy on me.
I'm doing what I'm supposed to be doing.
You see? Here it is again. See?
Here, follow this paint trail.
Here. It's here, see?
I am not going--
Come with me!
The paint trail goes here.
Let go of my arm!
James, we shouldn't be here.
Goddam it!
Leave me alone!
Let's get out of here.
James, we shouldn't be here.
Please don't kill me.
Don't kill me, please!
Don't kill me, don't kill me!
Stick around, bitch.
Are you all right?
Is he alive?
Go ahead.
We're runnin' out of time.
- You can't help him.
- Oh,Jesus!
James, you killed him!
All I see are dead people.
Come on.
- Come on.
- You never had a gun before!
I have one now.
Come on. Come on!
"Dragons in their pleasant palaces.
The seventh angel poured out his vial into the air... and there came--''
You!
You're one of us.
This is it.
Come on.
Can we help you?
It's just a tape.
I'm looking for the Army of the Twelve Monkeys.
We don't know anything about an Army of the Twelve Monkeys so just disappear.
-Just want some information.
- Didn't you hear me?
Don't hurt her!
Please, I'm a psychiatrist.
Just do whatever he tells you to do.
He's disturbed. He's dangerous.
- Please just cooperate.
- You want money?
- We only got a few bucks.
- I told you what I want.
Get down. Lock that door.
Lock it now!
- I told you that Goines would get us--
- Shut up!
- Goines?
-Jeffrey Goines?
Jeffrey becomes this big star, and the media latch onto him... because he's picketing his own father... a famous
Nobel-prize-winning virologist.
You must have seen all that on TV.
I don't watch TV.
Is this him?
Yeah, that's him, that's him.
What are you gonna do to us?
Tell me more about Jeffrey.
Jeffrey started getting bored with the shit we do-- picketing, leafleting, letter-writing stuff.
He said we were ineffectual, liberal jerk-offs.
He wanted to do guerrilla actions in order to educate the public.
- Like this?
- He let 100 snakes loose in the Senate.
But we weren't into that kind of stuff.
It's counterproductive. We told him.
So he and 11 guys, they split off... and formed this underground army.
The Army of the Twelve Monkeys.
See?
They started planning a"human hunt."
They bought stun guns, nets and bear traps.
They were gonna go to Wall Street and trap lawyers and bankers.
They didn't do it, of course.
They didn't do any of it.
Like always, Mr Big Shot sold his friends out.
What does that mean?
He goes on TV and gives this big news conference, tells the world... he just realized his dad's experiments are vital for humanity... and that the use of animals is absolutely necessary... that from now on, he,Jeffrey Goines, will personally supervise the labs... to make sure all the little animals aren't going to suffer.
What is this?
People like that aren't accessible.
You can't just barge in on them.
- It's not how the world works.
- Be quiet and drive the car.
- I know what I'm doing.
- No, you don't.
This car is stolen, and we are in big trouble.
Big trouble.
If you don't turn yourself over to the police, they're going to kill you.
They're going to shoot me, too, because I'm an accessory to murder.
- You're all going to die.
- Nobody is going to die.
You're not going to save the world, okay? You're delusional.
You've made all this up out of bits and pieces in your head.
- No.
- Yes!
Let me give you an example.
You know Jeffrey Goines. You were both patients at County Hospital.
Jeffrey Goines was a fruitcake.
He told you that his father was a famous scientist who worked with viruses... so you incorporated that information to this cockeyed fantasy.
He didn't say his father was a scientist. He said his father was God.
This is insane.
Prominent psychiatrist and author
Dr Kathryn Railly has been abducted...
by a dangerous mental patient,
James Cole.
Cole was under Railly's care
six years ago...
when he made
a dramatic escape--
- What is the matter with your leg?
- I got shot.
Shot?
Who shot you?
I don't know.
It was some kind of war. Never mind.
You wouldn't believe me anyway.
What are you doing?
-We don't need gas.
-I thought you didn't know how to drive.
I said I was too young to drive.
I didn't say I was stupid.
This can't go on.
If you have a bullet in your leg,
I have to take care of it.
I'm a doctor.
I need some supplies.
Meanwhile,
in Fresno, California...
where mining engineers
continue their attempt...
to sink a shaft parallel to the one
in which Ricky is believed trapped...
authorities say there is still a chance
the boy might be alive.
You shouldn't put your weight on it.
You need stitches and antibiotics.
Lucky for you, it's near the surface.
I love seeing the sun.
Wait.
Let me help you.
You smell so good.
You have to give yourself up.
You know that?
What are you doing? James?
- I'm sorry.
- What are you doing?
- Stop it! What are you doing?
- I'm sorry.
Let go of me!
- They find him?
- Who?
- That kid, the one in the pipe.
- You believe that?
They're lowering a monkey down there... with an infrared camera strapped on him... and a roast beef sandwich wrapped up in tin foil.
- You're makin' it up.
- I shit you not, man.
- Life is really weird.
- A monkey and a roast beef sandwich.
Would that I could enjoy this opulent dinner... and this most stimulating and exciting company... for itself, with no sense of purpose.
But, alas, I am burdened.
For with all this excess of public attention and cacophony of praise... there comes great responsibility.
I don't have to tell you all that the dangers of science... are a timeworn threat.
From Prometheus stealing fire from the gods--
What friend?
I'm not expecting anyone.
But never before--
This is ridiculous.
My father's giving a major address.
...to fear the power... we have at hand.
Normally, if we caught a guy... sneaking around with no ID, we'd bust his ass.
Excuse my French.
This one says he knows you.
Since you seem to have had a few unusual associates... we certainly would not want to arrest one of your closest pals.
Never seen him before in my life.
Feel free to torture this man, or whatever it is you do.
I'm going back to listen to my father's eloquent discourse on the perils of--
I'm here about some monkeys.
- Monkeys?
- Monkeys, yes.
Twelve of them.
Arnold.
- You look like shit.
- You know this man?
Of course I know this man.
Arnold Pettibone.
Gee, Arnie, it's black tie.
I said, "Drop by."
But it's Dad's big do--
VIPs, senators, secret service.
You hungry, Arnie?
Real killer feast we're putting on.
Lots of dead lamb, dead cow, dead pig.
Shall we?
Hi. How are you? Hello.
Very attractive.
"The Great Escape," 1990.
Watch it! Huh?
County Hospital? Am I right?
I can't do anything about what you're going to do.
I can't change anything.
I won't stop you. I can't stop you.
- I just want the information.
- Come on.
Hi, ladies. So nice to see you again.
Watch your step on the way down.
All right. Who blabbed?
Bruhns? Weller?
I just want access to the pure virus.
- Virus?
- I need to know where and what it is.
I get it. I see what you're up to.
It's your old plan, isn't it?
- What plan?
- Your plan.
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-Yes, you do.
We were in the day room watching television... and you were upset about the desecration of the planet, which I understand.
Then you said, "Wouldn't it be great to have a germ or virus... that would wipe out mankind and leave the animals and trees?''
- You're trying to confuse me.
- You were so funny.
I told you my father was this famous virologist.
You said, "He could make a germ, and we could steal it."
- You were so funny.
- They mutate! We live underground!
The world belongs to the dogs and cats.
We live like worms.
I just need the information!
-Take it easy.
-You are a nutcase, completely deranged!
Delusional, paranoid.
Your process is all fucked up.
Your information tray is jammed, man.
Do you know what it is, the Army of the Twelve Monkeys?
It's a collection of space-case do-gooders saving rain forests.
I have nothing to do with those bozos any more.
I've quit being the rich-kid fall guy for a bunch of ineffective fanatics!
So much for your grand plot, asshole!
My father has warned people about the dangers... of experimenting with DNA viruses for years.
You processed that information through your addled, paranoid infrastructure.
Lo and behold, a non-profit organization... becomes a sinister, revolutionary cabal!
This man is complete bat shit!
Ladies and gentlemen... do you realize where he thinks he comes from?
Captain Dan Miller, the man
in charge of the rescue operation...
says he has consulted with experts...
and they assure us
there will be no negative--
If you ask me, the monkey's gonna eat that goddam sandwich himself.
Did a man just come running through here?
His primary responsibility
was to the missing boy.
Police say
that the body of a woman...
found strangled
in Knutson State Park...
could be kidnapping victim...
Dr Kathryn Railly.
Anybody see someone come through here?
The body was discovered
less than an hour ago by hikers.
But we have an unconfirmed report
that the victim...
a woman in her late 20s
or early 30s...
was savagely mutilated.
Earlier in the day, police located
Railly's abandoned car.
It was found not far from--
Any sign of him?
Nothing.
He can't just disappear.
You bastard!
I could have died in there, you son of a bitch!
What are you thinking of... you twisted sack of shit?
Sorry I locked you in the trunk.
I'm sick of you.
What have you done?
Did you kill somebody?
Yes.
- A million people, five billion people.
- What?
Jeffrey Goines said that it was my idea about the virus.
We were in the institution.
It was all so fuzzy with the drugs.
Do you think it was my idea?
Do you think maybe
I wiped out the human race?
Nobody is gonna wipe out the human race.
Not you or Jeffrey or anybody else.
You've created something in your mind.
- Mentally divergent?
- Whatever.
A substitute reality... because you don't want to deal with anything.
I would love it if that was true.
It can be dealt with, but only if you want to.
I can help you.
- They're after me.
- Who is after you?
We have to get out of here.
There were policemen at that party.
Party? You went to a--
Never mind.
It's important you surrender instead of them catching you running away.
Wouldn't it be great if I was crazy?
Then the world would be okay.
- Give me the gun. Where is the gun?
- I lost the gun.
I could live right here.
You got water, air, stars.
- I'm gonna attract their attention.
- Debris.
I'm gonna attract their attention so they know where we are.
I love this world!
They're gonna tell you to put your hands on your head. Do what they say.
I love the frogs, the spiders.
I'll be with you.
I'll help you. I won't let them--
Then I said something about cooperating, and he said he would do that.
So I got in the car.
Thanks. And when l--
I started honking the horn, and when I got out, he was gone.
I tell you something.
You lucked out.
For a while we thought you were a body found down state, mutilated.
- He wouldn't do that.
- This the man he attacked?
I want to be clear about this, okay?
This man and the other one were severely beating us.
James Cole didn't start it.
In fact, he saved me.
Funny thing, Doctor.
Maybe you can help explain it to me, you being a psychiatrist and all.
Why do kidnap victims always tell us about the guys that grabbed 'em... and they try to make us understand... how kind these bastards really were.
It's a normal reaction to a life-threatening situation.
He's sick, okay?
He thinks he comes from the future.
He lives in a meticulously constructed fantasy world that's disintegrating.
He needs help.
Exhausted but apparently unharmed
by her 30-hour ordeal...
Dr Railly returned to Baltimore
without making a public statement.
The author and psychiatrist
is currently in seclusion at her home.
Meantime, police have pieced together
a scenario of the series of events...
that began with escaped
mental patient James Cole--
- Sorry.
- No, it's okay.
I'm just hyper-alert.
I can't sleep.
- Did you take a sedative?
- I hate those things. They mess me up.
With the kidnapping
of the Baltimore woman, James Cole...
is now also wanted in connection...
with the brutal slaying of Rodney
Wiggins, an ex-convict from Ardmore.
His body was discovered
in an abandoned theatre...
not far from where Cole left 3 animal
rights activists bound and gagged...
in their Second Avenue headquarters.
Now, do they really believe that he's going to show up here? Please.
In Fresno, California, the corn field
that was jammed with spectators--
He's dead, isn't he?
That little boy.
He's fine. It was just a prank he and his friends pulled.
The dramatic attempts to rescue Ricky
Neuman from an abandoned mine shaft...
ended abruptly
when playmates confessed...
that Neuman's disappearance
was a prank.
In fact, the missing child
was hiding in a nearby barn.
I found my thrill
On Blueberry Hill
On Blueberry Hill
When I found you
Congratulations, Cole.
Well done. Well done.
During your interview, while you were under the influence... you told us you liked music.
- This isn't a prison,James.
- This is a hospital.
- Until you recover your equilibrium.
- You're still a little disoriented.
- Time travel is a very stressful thing.
- You stood up very well, considering.
You connected the Twelve Monkeys with a famous virologist and his son.
- Others will take over now.
- We'll be back in service in months.
We'll retake the planet.
This is what you've been working for.
- A full pardon.
- You'll be out of here in no time.
- Women will want to get to know you.
- I don't want your women!
I want to get well!
And you will be well,James.
Soon.
You know, you people don't exist.
You're not real.
We can't travel back in time.
You're not here.
You can't trick me.
You're in my mind.
I am insane, and you are my insanity.
He not only used the word " prank" ... he said the boy was hiding in a barn.
Kathryn, Kathryn, he kidnapped you.
You saw him murder somebody... and you knew there was a real possibility... he could kill you too.
You're under tremendous emotional stress.
For God's sake, Owen, listen to me.
He knew about the boy in Fresno... and he says five billion people are gonna die.
No way he could possibly know that.
You're a rational person.
You're a trained psychiatrist.
You know the difference between what's real and what's not.
What we say is the truth is what everybody accepts, right?
Psychiatry is the latest religion.
We decide what's right and wrong.
We decide who's crazy or not.
I'm in trouble here.
I'm losing my faith.
You sure fucked up, Bob.
But I can understand.
You don't want your mistakes
pointed out to you.
I can relate to that, old Bob.
I know what you're thinkin'.
You're thinkin'I don't exist
except in your head.
I can see that point of view.
But you could still talk to me,
couldn't ya?
I saw you... in 1996, in the real world.
- You pulled out your teeth.
- Why would I pull out my teeth, Bob?
That's a no-no.
And when did you say you saw me?
- In 1872?
- Leave me alone!
Yellin' won't get you
what you want.
You have to be smart
to get what you want.
- What do I want?
- You don't know what you want?
Sure you do, Bob.
You know what you want.
You tell me.
Tell me what I want.
To see the sky and the ocean...
to be topside...
breathe the air...
to be with her.
Isn't that right?
Isn't that what you want?
Bob?
Jim Halperin, Philly PD.
Sorry to call you so early.
You found him? Is he okay?
No, no.
Au contraire, Doctor.
No sign of your good friend, the kidnapper.
However, the plot does thicken.
I got a ballistics report here on my desk.
It says the bullet you claim you removed from Cole's thigh... is, in fact, an antique.
And all indications are...
it was fired sometime
prior to the 1920s.
- How about I take a spin down there?
- This can't be.
You and I can grab a bite to eat... and maybe you could revise or amplify your statement.
You can't trick us, you know.
It wouldn't work.
No, sir.
You haven't become addicted,
have you...
to that dying world?
No, sir.
I just want to do my part to get us back on top... in charge of the planet.
And I have the experience.
I know the people involved.
He really is the most qualified.
But all that behaviour.
You said we weren't real.
I don't think the human mind is meant to exist... in two different... whatever you called it, dimensions?
It's just too stressful.
You said that yourself.
It's very confusing. You don't know what's real and what's not.
But you know what's real now.
Yes, sir, I do.
No, I don't know anything about... a monkey army, Doctor.
No, nothing whatsoever.
Good Lord, if my son was ever involved in something like that--
Yeah? Well, I'm sorry.
I think it's doubly inappropriate to discuss... security matters with you,
Dr Railly.
But if it will ease your mind... rest assured that neither my son... nor any other unauthorized person... has access to potentially dangerous organisms in my laboratory.
Is that clear to you now?
Thank you so much for your concern.
Women psychiatrists!
I attended a lecture of hers once.
" Apocalyptic Visions."
She was suddenly struck... by the most preposterous notion about Jeffrey.
Has she succumbed to her own...
"theoretical" Cassandra disease?
Maybe we ought to review our security procedures.
Perhaps upgrade 'em, you know?
Beef'em up.
Let's consider again our current information.
If the symptoms were first detected in Philadelphia... on December 27, 1996, that makes us know that--
It was released in Philadelphia probably on December 13, 1996.
And was seen sequentially after that in--
San Francisco, New Orleans...
Rio de Janeiro...
Rome, Kinshasa...
Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking.
That was very well done.
If you're in there,
I have to talk to you!
It's the kidnap woman. The one who was with the guy who tied us up.
Turn off the lights.
Turn off the light!
- What's she doin'?
- She's drawing attention to us.
I don't know what you're up to, but you're gonna get us in deep shit.
Walkies ready, batteries charged?
I saw you!
I saw somebody in there!
Secret experiments.
That's what they do.
Secret, weird stuff.
- Not just on animals.
- I know you.
- Do 'em on people too down at--
- Have you seen James Cole?
They're watching you.
- Takin' pictures.
- The police.
I know. Look.
I have to contact James.
It's very, very important that he's really careful when he reaches me.
Do you understand that?
- Good.
- Who's James?
He was with me.
He spoke to you several weeks ago.
He said that you were from the future and that you were watching him.
Bolt cutters.
Did you get the bolt cutters?
One dozen. They're in the van.
- The plans for the security system?
- All right here, committed to memory.
- You know what she's doin' out there?
- What's it say?
I can't see it.
Forget about my psychiatrist and concentrate on the task at hand.
Your psychiatrist?
- Did you just say your psychiatrist?
- Ex-psychiatrist.
This woman was your psychiatrist... and now she's spray-painting our building?
What's it say?
- What?
- There's a policeman over there.
- Pretend you don't know me.
- I want to turn myself in.
- Where is he?
-James! Down!
No, it's okay.
I'm not crazy any more.
I mean, I am. I'm mentally divergent.
I know that now.
I want you to help me.
I want to get better.
Let's get outta here.
He's going. Go!
- I've seen that before.
- No, you haven't.
A guy in a Ford is chasing her and some other guy I can't see.
No problem. It's probably just another kidnapping... featuring Jeffrey's shrink.
Pardon me.
Make that ex-shrink.
This is your leader?
A certifiable lunatic... who told his former psychiatrist all his plans... for God knows what wacko irresponsible schemes?
God knows what she's written on that wall!
Who cares what psychiatrists write on walls?
You think I told her about the Army of the Twelve Monkeys?
Impossible! Do you know why?
Do you know why?
Because, you pathetically ineffectual... and pusillanimous pretend friend to animals, I'll tell you why.
Because when I had anything to do with her six years ago... there was no such thing,
I hadn't thought of it yet.
Then how come she knows what's going on?
Well, here's my theory on that.
When I was institutionalized, my brain was studied exhaustively... in the guise of mental health.
I was interrogated, x-rayed.
I was examined thoroughly.
Then they took everything about me and put it into a computer... where they created this model of my mind.
Yes! Using that model... they managed to generate every thought...
I could possibly have in the next ten years... which they then filtered through a probability matrix of some kind... to determine everything
I was gonna do in that period.
So, you see... she knew I was gonna lead the Army of the Twelve Monkeys... into the pages of history before it even occurred to me.
She knows everything I'm ever gonna do before I know it myself.
How's that?
Kweskin, you finish here.
I'll meet you there.
And if you forget one thing, I'll have you shaved, sterilized and destroyed.
-Jeff?
- What?
You're a great man.
Fuck the bozos!
He's seriously crazy.
You know that.
There. Over there.
Okay. Come on.
- I need a room.
- Thirty-five bucks an hour.
- An hour?
- You want quarter hours?
Go someplace else.
Here's... twenty-five, six, seven for an hour.
Deal?
One hour, honey babe.
Number 64.
Sixth floor.
Up the stairs, end of the hall.
Elevator's busted.
She's not "honey babe."
She's a doctor.
My psychiatrist.
Understand?
Whatever gets it up for you,Jack.
Tommy, this is Charlie over at the Globe.
You know if Wallace has a new girl?
Sort of a rookie type?
A little weird? Does fantasy acts?
Okay, you were standing there looking up at the moon.
You were splashing through the water, and then what?
I thought I was in prison again.
Just like that, you were in prison?
No, not really.
Like you said, it was all in my mind.
You disappeared.
One minute you were there, the next minute you were gone.
Did you run through the woods, or--
I don't know.
I don't remember.
The boy in the well.
How did you know that was just a hoax?
It was?
I didn't know.
You said he was hiding in a barn!
I think I maybe saw a TV show about that... when I was a kid where a boy--
It wasn't a TV show!
It was real!
Maybe this boy saw the same TV show that I did... and he copied it.
Look, you were right.
I am mentally ill.
I imagined all these things, these people.
I know they're not real.
I can trick them.
I can make them do what I want.
I worked on 'em a little bit.
I got back here to get better.
- I can stay here.
- What does this mean to you?
I think I had a dream about this.
You had a bullet from World War I in your leg. How did it get there?
I don't know. You said I had delusions, that I created this world.
- You said you could explain.
- I can't!
I'm trying to, and--
I can't believe that everything we say or do has already happened.
We can't change what's gonna happen.
And if five billion people are gonna die, it's--
I want the future to be unknown.
I want to become a whole person again.
I want this to be the present.
I want to stay here this time... with you.
Do you remember six years ago you had a phone number?
- It was the wrong number then.
- A woman answered.
It was the wrong number in 1990.
It should be the right number now.
Do you remember it?
The number.
This is my territory, bitch!
- Is this real or one of my delusions?
- This is definitely real.
Excuse me. I think we've got a little misunderstanding here.
- Yeah. We--
- Gee, really?
Now, you just sit tight, chief.
You listen to me, little Miss Understanding.
You think you can go around me and peddle your ass in this part of town?
You bet your life we got what I would call... a major fuckin' misunderstanding.
James, no! Don't!
Put him in the closet.
Take his money first!
- You want me to rob him?
- We need cash!
Call the cops!
Call the cops!
What's goin' on?
I've got friends, man.
Don't fuckin' kill me.
No,James!
Open the door!
What the fuck are you doing?
Please don't hurt him.
Open the door.
James, come on.
Just in case--
Just in case I'm not crazy, this is how they find us.
By our teeth.
I don't want them to find me ever.
I don't want to go back.
Step back.
You'd better load.
Police! Throw your weapons out and come on out!
Hey! Is that the cops?
I'm the innocent victim here.
I was attacked by a coked-up whore... and a fuckin' crazy dentist.
Try to blend in.
Oh,Jesus!
Come on.
There's gotta be a phone around here somewhere.
Over there. Look.
I'm gonna try that number, okay?
Let's hope it's nothing.
It's okay! We're insane.
We're crazy.
It's a carpet cleaning company.
- A carpet cleaning company?
- Yeah. No superiors.
No scientists.
No men from the future.
It's just a carpet cleaning company.
They have voice mail.
You leave a message telling where you want your carpet cleaned.
- You left them a message?
- Yeah, I couldn't resist.
Wait till they hear this nutty woman telling them to watch out... for the Army of the Twelve Monkeys.
I said, "The Freedom for Animals
Association on Second Avenue--"
"Is the secret headquarters of the Army of the Twelve Monkeys.
They're the ones who are gonna do it.
I can't do anything more now.
I have to go.
Have a merry Christmas.''
You couldn't have heard me.
They got your message.
They played it for me.
It was a bad recording, distorted.
I didn't recognize your voice.
This.
And this.
And this.
Is everything okay?
You want anything?
Shall I put this on your account, ma'am?
No. That'll be cash.
Can you tell me what floor the wigs are on?
You turned the thing into a fucking computer.
- And Fale believed it.
- You know Fale.
He's like, "If you guys get nailed, which I'm pretty sure you will...
I've never seen you before in my fuckin' life.''
Come on, come on.
Bring him through.
Drive!
What's the harm in openin' up the bag?
His eyes are taped, right?
Right?
Hello. Hello.
Wanna hear the monkey speak?
Jeffrey?
Jeffrey, I know that's you.
- I recognize your voice.
- No, you don't.
I also know all about your warped little plan.
That lady, your psychiatrist?
She told me.
I didn't believe her.
It just seemed too crazy, even for you.
But just in case, I took steps... to make sure that you couldn't go through with it.
I don't have the code any more.
I don't have access to the virus.
I took myself out of the loop.
Too late! Too late!
We've got plans for you, Dad.
I never let myself believe it.
Now I know it's true.
Jeffrey?
You're completely insane.
No, I'm not.
There's a cross section of one of
the old trees that's been cut down.
Here I was born.
And there I died.
It was only a moment for you.
You took no notice.
I think I've seen this movie before.
- When I was a kid, I saw it on TV.
- Don't talk.
- I did see it before.
- Tall trees.
Have you been here before?
- Yes.
- When?
- But I don't recognize this--
- When were you born?
- Long ago.
- Where?
What's the matter?
Tell me.
Madeleine, tell me.
It's just like what's happening with us.
Like the past.
The movie never changes.
It can't change.
But every time you see it, it seems different because you're different.
You see different things.
Please don't ask me.
If you can't change anything because it's already happened... you may as well smell the flowers.
What flowers?
It's an expression.
Why are you doing this?
I want to know why.
What if I'm wrong?
What if you're wrong?
What if I am crazy?
In a few weeks, it will have started or it won't.
If there's still... football games, traffic jams...
TV shows and armed robberies... we're going to be so glad... that we'll be thrilled to see the police.
I'm responsible for you now.
The Chinese say
once you've saved a person's life...
you're responsible for it forever,
so I'm committed.
Do you have a plan?
I have to know.
There's so little that I know.
You said you'd never seen the ocean.
Hurry up. Come on.
Jeffrey?
You know I can't see.
Where are we?
Jeffrey? Please.
We have 9:30 reservations for Key West.
I just didn't recognize you.
Well, you look pretty different yourself.
It was always you.
In my dream.
It was always you.
I remember you like this.
You do?
I felt I've known you before.
I feel like I've always known you.
I'm so scared.
What time's your flight, friends?
- Might be tight.
Tight? No.
My watch says 7:30.
On your normal mornin', okay.
Plenty of time.
But today you gotta take into account your Army of the Twelve Monkeys factor.
What? What'd you say?
Twelve Monkeys.
In case you folks didn't turn on your radio this mornin'.
Bunch of weirdos let all the animals out of the zoo.
Then they locked up this big-shot scientist in one of the cages.
Scientist's own kid one of the ones did it.
They've got animals all over the place.
Bunch of zebras closed down the thruway about an hour ago.
And they got some thing called an emu.
It's got traffic blocked for miles on 676.
What do they think they're accomplishing
by releasing an animal like this...
into a city like this one?
That's what they were up to-- freeing animals.
On the walls. It said, "We did it."
They meant the animals.
I think it's gonna be all right.
Tell your people if they spot either one of them not to try and apprehend them.
They should notify us.
We have people all over the airport.
We'll take care of it.
- I know this place.
- Airports all look the same.
This is my dream.
- Your moustache.
- It's not just my dream.
I was actually here.
I remember now.
About a week or two before everyone started dying.
Careful.
They might be looking for us.
- I was here as a kid.
- Use this.
I think you were here then too.
If they identify us, they're going to send us someplace... but it won't be Key West.
I'll go fix this.
I'm gonna get the tickets.
I'll meet you in the newspaper stand.
Judy Simmons.
I have reservations for Key West.
- I don't see a lot of this. It's cash.
- It's a long story.
We'll begin boarding in about 20 minutes.
- You have a nice flight, Miss Simmons.
- Thank you.
Hello. How are you today?
I don't know whether you're there or not.
Maybe you just clean carpets.
If you do, you're lucky.
You're gonna live a long, happy life.
But if you other guys are out there, if you're picking this up... forget about the Army of the Twelve Monkeys.
They didn't do it. It was a mistake.
Someone else did it.
The Army of the Twelve Monkeys is just a bunch of dumb kids... playing revolutionaries.
Listen, I've done my job.
I did what you wanted.
Good luck.
I'm not coming back.
San Francisco, New Orleans...
Rio de Janeiro, Rome...
Kinshasa, Karachi,
Bangkok and Peking.
This is some trip you're taking, sir.
Is this all in one week?
Business.
Have a good one, sir.
Got yourself a prob, Bob?
Leave me alone!
I made a report.
I didn't have to do that.
Point of fact:
You don't belong here.
It's not permitted to let you stay.
This is the present.
This is not the past.
This is not the future.
This is right now!
I'm not leaving! Get that?
You can't stop me.
Anything you say, chief.
It's none of my business.
- Hey, Cole.
- Leave me alone!
Calm down, Cole. It's me.
Cole, it's me.
-Jose?
- Yeah, right,Jose.
Why'd you pull out the tooth?
That was nuts.
- Here, take this.
- What for? Are you crazy?
Me? Are you kidding?
You're the one.
You're a hero, man.
They pardoned you, and you come back and fuck with your teeth.
- How did you find me?
- The phone call, man.
They did their reconstruction thing on it.
The phone--
The phone call I just made?
- Five minutes ago.
- Yeah, five minutes ago.
Thirty years ago.
They just put it together.
"Uh, hey, this is Cole,James.
I don't know whether you're there or not. Maybe you just clean carpets.''
Where'd you get that from?
"Forget about the Army of the Twelve Monkeys."
Man, if only they could've got your message earlier.
Take it. You could still be a hero if you cooperate!
Come on,James.
It's okay.
- $6.50's your change. Thank you.
- Thank you.
Flight 784 for San Francisco
is ready for boarding at gate 38.
Oh, my God!
I got orders to shoot the lady if you don't go along this time.
- What?
- Yeah, you got that?
- They said, "If Cole don't obey--"
- I'll break your fuckin' head!
You hear me?
Volunteers now boarding
at gate 37.
You see?
I had no choice.
These are my orders, man.
Just take it.
Take it!
This part isn't about the virus at all, is it?
It's about following orders, about doing what you're told.
Hey, man, you got a pardon.
What do you want?
Who am I supposed to shoot?
Who am I supposed to shoot?
James! It's Dr Goines' assistant.
He's an apocalypse nut.
I think he's involved.
The next flight to San Francisco leaves from gate 38.
If he's there,
I'm sure he's part of it.
Mr Holtz, you wanna have a look at this, please?
Sir, would you mind letting me have a look at the contents of your bag?
We don't have time for this.
Excuse me.
Biological samples.
I have the papers right here.
I'm gonna have to ask you to open this up, sir.
Open it?
Why, yes, of course.
What could be better?
Look at the planes. Hurry up.
- Excuse me.
- Ma'am, you have to get in the line.
You see?
Biological.
Check the papers.
It's all proper.
I have a permit.
- It's empty.
- Well, yes, to be sure.
It looks empty, but I assure you, it's not.
- You don't understand.
- I don't have to.
This is very important.
There's a man carrying a deadly virus.
There, you see?
Also invisible to the naked eye.
It doesn't even have an odour.
That's not necessary, sir.
There you go.
Thank you for your cooperation.
Have a good flight.
- Who are you calling a moron?
- I am calling you a fucking moron!
- A fucking moron?
- Get your hands off her!
Hold it!
Wait a moment.
There he is! That man!
He's carrying a deadly virus!
Stop him!
Somebody, please stop him!
Police officer.
He's got a gun!
Watch it!
Freeze!
Excuse me.
It's obscene.
All the violence, all the lunacy.
Shootings even at airports now.
You might say that we're the next endangered species.
Human beings.
I think you're right, ma'am.
I think you've hit the nail on the head.
Jones is my name.
I'm in insurance.
And now, a fireside chat with the creators of South Park:
Matt Stone and Trey Parker.
- Oh, hello. I'm Trey Parker.
- I'm Matt Stone.
This here's old Scratch.
Say hi, old fella.
This episode is called "Weight Gain
4000." It's our favorite episode.
Kathie Lee Gifford comes to South Park...
...and Eric Cartman beefs himself up for the big day.
How much weight does Cartman gain in this episode?
After Cartman eats Weight Gain 4000, he gains 700 pounds.
That makes him as heavy as Sally Struthers.
Has Kathie Lee Gifford offended you?
Was she flattered by her depiction?
We don't really care.
We think she's a fu...
Very wonderful woman. Both Trey and I really respect her work with Regis.
Guns and bullets seem to be a recurring theme.
Have either of you ever killed anyone?
I would never kill somebody, unless they pissed me off.
Why do you keep killing Kenny?
What did he do to you?
Kenny is definitely our favorite character.
But we have to kill him every episode.
This is one of our favorite deaths.
How do you create a show like South
Park and remain pure and wholesome?
Everyone thinks that to do South Park, we must be wild rock stars...
...but we're wholesome
Middle American guys.
We enjoy soda pop, baseball and beating up old people as much as anybody.
So, now sit back, relax and enjoy
"Weight Gain 4000."
Weight Gain 4000
- Did you see that rainbow this morning?
- It was huge.
I hate those things!
- Nobody hates rainbows.
- What's there to hate about them?
Well, you'll be minding your business and they'll come marching in...
...and crawl up your leg and bite the inside of your ass.
And you'll be all like, "Hey, get out of my ass, you stupid rainbows!"
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Rainbows. I hate those things.
Rainbows are those arches of color that show up when it rains.
Oh, rainbows! Oh, yeah, I like those.
Those are cool.
- What were you talking about?
- Nothing, forget it.
What crawls up your leg and bites the inside of your ass?
Nothing!
Children, remember the Save Our
Fragile Planet essay contest...
...that you worked so hard on last month?
One of our very own South Park students has won the national prize.
Wow, I knew I would win.
- Mr. Garrison, this sure is exciting.
- Right, Mr. Hat.
The winner of the national Save Our
Fragile Planet contest is:
Eric Cartman.
- What?!
- What?!
Congratulations on writing the winning paper.
Kick ass!
Cartman doesn't know a rain forest from a Pop-Tart.
Yeah, I do. Pop-Tarts are frosted.
Out of over a million papers,
Eric's was chosen as the winner.
- Wow! What did you write about?
- You know, this and that.
- He doesn't know what he wrote.
- What was your paper about?
It was on the suffering of bottle-nosed dolphins.
You shouldn't have written about dolphins. Dolphins are stupid.
Dude, dolphins are the second smartest animal on the planet.
Right. If they're so damn smart, how come they get caught in fishing nets?
- What?
- Wait, there's more.
It says here that Eric's trophy will be presented to him by...
...Kathie Lee Gifford?
Kathie Lee is coming here?
The presentation will be on television.
Television?
Kathie Lee Gifford.
I don't believe it.
Kathie Lee Gifford in South Park!
Oh, my God! This is our chance to make a name for ourselves...
...to show we're not some pissant mountain town.
It's a chance for you to get publicity.
If I can show how much I turned South
Park around, I could become a senator!
- Maybe even a state senator!
- Let's decorate the town square.
We should have the chef of the school sing and show our ethnic diversity.
That's right!
He's a black guy, isn't he?
Black as the night.
Yes! And we can have the children of South Park put on a play.
Kathie Lee loves children.
If they're working in a sweatshop, that is.
Thank you.
You guys, guess what?
After I'm on television,
I'm gonna be totally famous.
Hitler was famous too.
- Hello, children.
- Hey, Chef.
- How are my little crackers?
- Good.
Did you hear? Kathie Lee Gifford is coming to South Park!
Because Cartman cheated and won the essay contest.
Yeah, whatever. But the mayor called and asked me to sing at the ceremony.
- Are you gonna do it?
- Of course.
Kathie Lee is a beautiful, sultry queen of sexual fantasy.
If I sing to her, maybe I can lure her into a night of exotic delectation.
Yeah, that'd be cool!
Well, three times bigger than Frank Gifford's, anyway.
I can't concentrate on grading papers with all this excitement.
Why are you looking at me like that?
Have you forgotten the pain and suffering Kathie Lee caused you?
Mr. Hat, that was a long time ago, and I was only a child.
We could've won that talent show.
- Knock, knock, Mr. Hat.
- Who's there?
- Orange.
- Orange who?
Orange you glad I didn't say banana?
Thank you.
Wow, Mr. Hat.
Looks like we might win.
And now, our last talent-show finalist...
...Kathie Lee Epstein.
It wasn't fair. She had choreography.
How could we compete with that?
But she's coming to South Park, and I know how to make it better.
How?
No, Mr. Hat! I couldn't...
...kill Kathie Lee Gifford.
Children, as you all know,
Mrs. Kathie Lee Gifford...
...will be here to present the award to some kid for an essay.
- That kid is me!
- Whatever.
I'm going to have you luscious youngsters...
...do a play about the history of South Park.
That's wonderful, right, Mr. Hat?
- Kill her!
- Mr. Hat!
Mr. Garrison, I'm asking you to direct our play.
That's perfect.
You see, Mr. Hat, we don't have to kill her. We can upstage her.
You might want to review the essays.
We think Cartman cheated.
Who cares? Now, kids, what's say we give it our South Park best!
- Who's our little prizewinner again?
- Me, Eric Cartman!
How about we get in shape? We want to look our best on TV, don't we?
Yes, ma'am.
I'm gonna be on television
I'm gonna be on television
I'm gonna be on television
I'm gonna be on television
We don't believe you won that contest fairly, fat boy.
Stop defending your girlfriend for writing about stupid fish.
- Dolphins are intelligent and friendly.
- Intelligent and friendly on rye bread.
- Dolphins are smarter than you.
- Then why do they live in igloos?
- That's not dolphins. That's Eskimos!
- Who cares?
- It's tree-hugging hippie crap.
- Tell me what you wrote!
I can't. I have to go home and get in shape!
Yeah, right! You'll go watch TV and eat Cheesy Poofs, ass-master.
Screw you, hippie!
We'll be right back to Jesus and Pals after this.
Need to get in shape fast?
Wanna look your best?
Tired of not getting chicks?
Tired of being a 90-pound weakling?
Yeah, I only weigh 90 pounds.
Then bulk up quick with Weight Gain 4000!
Over 4000 grams of saturated fat per serving. Its formula is designed...
...to go to the stomach, where it is distributed to the blood!
Now available at stores everywhere.
- Say it with me, "Beefcake!"
- Beefcake.
- Beefcake!
- Beefcake!
May cause irreversible damage to kidneys and liver.
Mom, can you get me some Weight Gain 4000?
Okay, Eric.
I'll get you some tomorrow.
But, Mom, I need it for tomorrow!
But tomorrow is grocery day, Eric.
Mom!
Okay, okay. Well, I guess
I'll be going to the store now, then.
No, no!
Kill her!
No, Mr. Hat, I won't do it.
Kill!
That does it. You're going in the dresser drawer, Mr. Hat.
- She'll make a fool of you again.
- Stay in that drawer, negative Nancy.
Hey, dudes.
What is wrong with you? Haven't you noticed the snow on the ground?
I have a nice body, and I wanna show it off!
- What? You've got to weigh 90 pounds!
- I'm up to 94, thank you very much.
Yeah, they're almost as big as his mom's!
Laugh all you want! I'll be the one on TV looking all buff.
- What's that stuff?
- Weight Gain 4000. It's bulking me up.
- Bulk up to what? Fat-ass?
- Super fat-ass?
Hey, I don't have to take that kind of crap from you scrawny weaklings!
Sweet, check me out. I'm such a beefcake I can't get through the door.
Come on, people. We've got to turn this place around.
Hang up the lights, string up the banners, castrate the cows!
Well, Mr. Garrison, how is the little play going?
Fine. We were just about to run it from the top.
Oh, please do. I'm dying to see it.
All the little pioneers on this side of the stage.
All the little Indians to the center of the stage.
- Am I an Indian or a pioneer?
- You have a feather on your head?
- Yes.
- Then you're an Indian.
Bebe, this is your line.
This is the story of South Park.
It begins over 100 years ago...
...when the noble and hearty
Ute Indians lived on the land.
Oh, don't they look adorable?
Then from the East came the great white pioneers.
- Oh, my God!
- They did it better this morning.
They had more energy.
The pioneers met with the Indians...
...and negotiated for their fertile lands.
We cannot have our children beating each other in front of Kathie Lee!
What do you want?
This is how it happened.
Take that, you stupid Indian!
Mr. Garrison, this is not appropriate!
Do you actually think that
Kathie Lee Gifford would enjoy this?
To hell with Kathie Lee Gifford!
What have I said?
He said,
"To hell with Kathie Lee Gifford!"
Mr. Garrison, I am dismissing you from directing our play.
It happened again, didn't it?
Now we do things my way.
I can't kill her, Mr. Hat.
You're gonna have to do it.
- Cartman, talk about wide load.
- I'm starting to fill out nicely.
No, you're not.
You're fatter than ever!
I'm not fat, I'm getting in shape!
You're such a fat-ass, when you walk around, people go:
"Goddamn, that's a big fat-ass!"
No, they don't, you jealous weakling!
Goddamn, that's a big fat-ass!
- Hi, guys.
- Oh, look, another hippie.
- Peace, Wendy.
- Shut up, Cartman!
Two little hippies sitting in a tree
I'll find Cartman's paper and get to the bottom of this.
- Can I help you?
- Yes. I need a gun.
Would this be for hunting, protection or other?
- Other.
- Alrighty then.
May I suggest a Stratford 12 mm?
Go ahead. Try it on!
That looks nice on you.
The lacquered black matches your eyes.
You talking to me?
You talking to me?
- I don't know, it's a little small.
- Okay. How about this?
You talking to me?
I don't like this one either.
Here's the same gun with a wood finish.
You talking to me?!
I don't see anybody else here, so you must be talking to me.
I'll take it.
Hello?
"My essay, by Eric Cartman.
When I wrote the following pages, or rather the bulk of them...
...I lived alone in the woods on the shore of..."
Mr. Hat, old Kathie Lee really will be surprised when she gets here tomorrow.
She beat us in the talent show all those years ago.
I think we owe her for that.
Oh, my God!
- Howdy, Mr. Garrison. Nice gun.
- Thank you.
- Nice gun, Mr. Garrison.
- Thanks.
- Hello, Officer Barbrady.
- Nice gun.
Is there somewhere in town I can get a good, clear shot...? View of Kathie Lee?
I think the book depository would be a good bet.
That might do quite nicely.
Thank you, Officer Barbrady.
No problem.
Caught you red-handed!
No pictures of Kathie Lee!
Where is she?
This is sweet. Camera crews are setting up, and I look totally ripped.
- Beefcake. Beefcake!
- They won't get all of you in frame.
- Guys, we have to stop him!
- Stop who?
Mr. Garrison! He's going to try to kill Kathie Lee Gifford!
No, you don't!
You won't ruin my moment of fame.
He's got a gun!
You gotta get over this jealousy thing.
Seriously, just face it.
I wrote a better paper than you.
It just so happens that I have your paper, and I know why you won.
There's something more important now.
You've got to prioritize.
What's more important:
Being on TV or some stupid assassination?
Stan, I can't do it alone. Please?
We're losing him.
Here she comes!
Damn, I'm not the only one who's thought of killing her.
We love you, Kathie Lee!
We love you too.
Come on, you little bitch.
You've gotta leave your precious bubble sometime.
It is with great pride and honor that I'd like to welcome...
...Mrs. Kathie Lee Gifford to South Park!
And now our very own
South Park Elementary chef...
...will sing a special song in honor of Mrs. Lee Gifford!
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.
You know, Kathie Lee, you are a very special woman.
I don't mean special in a Mary Tyler Moore way...
...or special in an extra-value meal at Happy Burger way.
No, no, no. I mean special.
Like the song of the hummingbird...
...as it gets ready to find that female hummingbird...
...and make sweet love to it all night long.
Just two hummingbirds moaning and groaning...
...and letting their bodies caress and touch each other in ecstasy.
What?
What?!
Thank you, Chef, for that heartwarming song.
Thank you, Chef!
God bless you, Kathie Lee!
Mr. Garrison is about to kill
Kathie Lee! We have to find him!
What? You mean the teacher?
Wait a minute.
Is there somewhere in town I can get a good, clear shot...? View of Kathie Lee?
I think the book depository would be a good bet.
I think the book depository would be a good bet.
Book depository. Depository.
Damn, he could be anywhere!
I'll send out an APB.
Wendy, look!
And now, here to present the award...
...for the environmental essay to our own Eric Kaufman...
Cartman, goddamn it!
...is your favorite celebrity and mine...
...Kathie Lee Gifford!
Thank you. I love you all.
Mr. Garrison! Stop!
Leave us. We must finish what we have begun.
I know she's hurt you.
She's hurt a lot of people.
- You can't know.
- You should've won that talent show.
It is with honor and pride that I present the winner this trophy.
- Eric, would you please come up here?
- Here it is, my big moment of fame.
Then she threw her voice with two dummies at once.
I know that, but this isn't the answer.
It is too late for me, young Wendy.
I've learned something today.
You can't win all the time.
If you don't win, you can't hold it against the person who did...
...because that's the only way you ever really lose.
You're right.
Good.
She really threw her voice with two dummies?
The bitch must die!
Oh, my God, they killed Kenny!
You bastard!
- Gun!
- Gun!
Hey, come back!
We didn't even get to do our play!
That's it. Wrap it up.
Hey, wait a minute.
When do I get to be on television?
Forget it.
No Kathie Lee, no public interest.
But I won the environmental essay contest!
You don't deserve to win, Cartman, and you know it!
I'm holding Cartman's paper. It's actually nothing more than Walden...
...with Thoreau's name crossed out and
Cartman's name written in its place.
- Who cares?
- Kathie Lee Gifford's gone.
What about not holding anything against the winner?
Well, not if it's Cartman.
Hey, where are you all going?
They don't even know what Walden is.
I bet if Walden was a sitcom you'd know what it was!
Come on. Kyle's mom will make tuna-fish sandwiches.
What the hell.
No, no! Now I'll be stuck in this Podunk town forever...
...with all these stupid, hick, redneck, jobless, truck-driving idiots!
Mayor, the mike is on.
Thought you could get away with it, Mr. Hat?
I would have, if it weren't for those meddling kids.
You're lucky you missed Kathie Lee and that nobody got hurt.
We hope you can come back to school soon.
I'd love to, but the doctors say
Mr. Hat needs more therapy.
We can still get her!
I'm just sorry I ruined everyone's chances for being on TV.
Not Cartman.
He gets to be on TV anyway.
Really? On what?
Obesity.
Adiposity. Corpulence.
Whatever word you use, it represents one thing:
Being a big fat-ass.
We have with us via satellite
Eric Cartman from South Park...
...who is now so obese, he can't even get out of his house.
When is this gonna be on the air?
Is there anything you'd like to say to the people?
Follow your dreams.
You can reach your goals.
I'm living proof.
Beefcake. Beefcake!
He needs to run his ass around the block.
How about more of that good loving?
Damn! I gave you sweet loving five minutes ago!
You trying to kill me?
So, here's the deal.
We are in the garden, right?
And everything is great.
And there's this tree.
And the man says,
"Ooh, see that tree?
"Don't eat the fruit of that tree.
"That apple you do not eat."
He goes inside, names some animals... maybe takes a dump.
Anyway, what does she do?
She eats the apple!
I can't believe what I'm seeing!
He says, "Don't eat it!"
She eats it!
Unbelievable!
Since then, men, women...
I don't know.
It's all going wrong!
So inviting
So exciting
Whenever you're near
I hear a symphony
A tender melody
Pulling me closer
Closer to your arms
Then suddenly
Your lips are touching mine
A feeling so divine
Till I leave the past behind
I'm lost in a world
Of make-believe
Whenever you're near
I hear a symphony...
Divorce.
Miserable marriage.
Wedding canceled.
Remarried.
Divorced again.
Ahh!
Irreconcilable sexual disharmony!
Dysfunctional marriage!
Divorce! Divorce!
Divorce! Divorce!
Divorce! Divorce!
Well?
Talk to me.
We had a bad run.
Things have changed down there.
Men and women aren't like they used to be.
Well, things are changing up here as well.
I'm getting pressure from above... if you know what I mean, for results!
For men and women to be bonded in eternal bliss.
In the meantime, I've been instructed to introduce... new incentive schemes for our leading operatives.
Leading operatives, huh?
That's you.
Skip the flattery,
Gabriel. Where's the beef?
It's a hard case to crack.
I have full confidence you can do it.
If you don't... you don't come back.
What?
No way.
That's the new incentive scheme.
Your mission is to unite man and woman... blah, blah, blah, blah, OK?
When you're done... you come back.
If youfail... you stay down there forever.
You are not serious.
Liberatum mani.
It's out of my hands.
No ordinary sin
This perfect working order
I'd rather sink than swim
If I can't walk on water
Let the scandal in
This perfect world disorder
I'd rather drown than swim
I can't walk on water
This taste of dilution
Velvet divorce
I get bored
Velvet divorce
I get bored
Velvet divorce
Velvet divorce
I get bored
She's the secret daughter... of Marilyn Monroe and John F. Kennedy, right?
I mean, that's why Marilyn was murdered.
So, the young girl grows up in an orphanage... unaware of her incredible parentage.
Years go by.
She's beautiful.
She's smart.
She's successful, OK?
Then what?
Well, then...
Then she gets sent to London as U.S. ambassador.
Where she discovers who she is... and also unravels the secret of the Nazi gold... hidden underneath the embassy.
Uh, yeah.
It's kind of obvious, Robert.
Of course it's obvious, guys.
It's a trash novel.
You buy it in the airport, you take it on holiday.
Oh, Ms. Gesteten.
Nice to see you down here.
I'd love to stay and talk, but, um, you know how things...
Nice trick, Celine.
- Want to try your luck?
- With the gun?
With the fruit.
I don't have time for games.
If you're afraid, why don't you just say so?
Celine, last night, we discussed a certain proposal.
And I said no, because you cheat, Elliot.
OK.
So I'm flirtatious.
It's in my nature.
But I want you to think again.
Do you know how difficult it is for a woman to find... a good husband in this town?
Let alone a good dentist.
Celine...
I'm serious.
Robots?
You're telling us we're gonna be replaced by robots?
That robots will get down on their robot hands and knees... and clean the dust out of every office in this building?
I think not, Ms. Gesteten.
At least the robot won't spend its time writing a trash novel.
Not even a very good trash novel, as I understand it.
Oh, I see. This is personal.
This has nothing to do with me,
Robert.
This comes right from the top... from Mr. Naville himself.
Perhaps it's time
I spoke to this Mr. Naville guy.
It's too late.
You're fired.
You ready?
Mm-hmm.
Now, if you move... the offer's canceled.
OK.
Mm-hmm.
- Wait, Celine...
- Don't speak.
Do you think this is wise?
Puts me off.
Ha.
Ha.
Stop!
Aah! Aah! Aah!
Mayhew...
Would you call a doctor?
It would be a pleasure, madam.
What are you doing here this time of day?
Hi, Lily.
Well? Answer me.
Lily, I... I got fired.
They replaced me with a robot.
I know how they feel.
Hmm?
Look, I've been meaning to tell you this... for a while now, and... seems like a good a time as any.
Robert...
I'm leaving you.
You're leaving?
What are you talking about?
His name is Ryan.
He teaches aerobics.
We're in love.
We're moving to Miami.
How can you do this?
At a time like this!
I want a man, not a dreamer.
I don't know what to say.
We could talk about this.
I'll get another job.
We'll sort everything out.
Sorry... but as of tonight... you're going home alone.
Uh...
Lily!
I'm leaving you.
You're fired.
It's kind of obvious, Robert.
He teaches aerobics.
We're in love.
We're moving to Miami.
Oh.
Lily?
Lily?
Mr. Robert Lewis?
Yeah, that's me.
My name is Jackson.
This is my associate
Ms. O'Reilly.
We're from the Firm But Fair
Eviction & Collection Agency.
I have a list of certain items we're empowered to collect... under federal and state law... in lieu of unpaid debts.
Furthermore, we are contracted to serve upon you... notice of eviction from these here premises, uh, forthwith.
I beg your pardon?
We can do this with violence or without.
It's up to you.
The client pays our medical bills, but not yours.
Well?
Oh, without, please.
Good choice.
OK, let's go.
All right.
Cannot believe this.
Do you have any idea... how difficult it is to find a good husband in this town?
Hmm?!
Or a good dentist, come to that?
Playing this sort of game... you have disgraced yourself once again.
You caught him through the frontal lobe... so apparently he'll live.
But he'll never practice orthodontics again... that's for sure.
Mr. Schneider, call extension 487.
Mr. Schneider,487.
My main fear is you're going to end up like your mother... who long ago found her own natural level in society.
That is to say she scuttles along the bottom.
Her biggest problem was marrying a man like you... a mistake I have taken great care to avoid.
You... are gonna go to work, my girl.
What?
You have spent a quarter of a century... watching the tide go in and out... but from tomorrow, you are going to work... here, under my supervision.
You're gonna learn the essence of business... about money and how it flows relentlessly back... towards he who owns it.
How to generate a profit from a loss... a loss from a profit.
You are gonna work.
This may not strike you as very palatable.
Seven...
It may make you want to vomit.
But you will get used to the taste.
And pretty soon, you'll be spooning it down... and asking for more like all the other kids.
Eleven...
Mr. Naville, I presume?
Eleven...
You think you can replace me with a robot?
Eleven...
Well, get this!
Eleven...
Aah!
Twelve... thirteen...
Fuck.
Fourteen...
Ohh!
Nobody fucking move!
Nobody fucking move!
Aah! Aah!
Aah! Aah!
Everyone on the floor!
Everyone!
Everyone!
Four, five... six... seven...
Now, I want my job back!
I want what I had before,
Mr. Naville!
I'm gonna count to five.
If you don't oblige me,
I'm gonna kill you.
One!
Two!
Three!
Four!
Five!
Ow!
- Ow!
- Ow!
- What did you say that for?
- Five comes directly after four.
I know that!
I thought you had a problem.
It's nothing to be ashamed of.
Without access to a proper education...
- Shut up!
- I was just trying to help.
I don't need any help.
You'll die for this,
I swear to God.
- I'm sorry. No.
- You could shoot him again.
In the head this time.
I'll count to five.
Shut up!
Who are you, anyway?
Nobody!
I'm his daughter.
Aah!
This kid's got a gun.
Hey, cool it.
Take it easy, pal.
Chill out.
Drive!
Will you just drive?!
I can't.
- What?
- I don't know how.
- You don't know how to drive?
- I never learned.
- Why not?!
- I didn't need to!
Well, you do now!
This one makes it go faster, that one slower.
This is forwards, that's backwards.
The rest you can pick up as we go along.
Drive!
Where are we going?
Never mind that.
Just drive more carefully.
He cut in on me.
Mirror, signal, maneuver.
You say nothing, OK?
Afternoon, ma'am.
Afternoon, sir.
My name's Walt.
I'm here to help you any way
I can during your visit... be it short or long... and whether it is purely for refueling purposes... or for the use of our extensive washroom and retail facilities.
- Is this a gas station, Walt?
- It sure is, sir.
Then fill it up with gas and cut the crap.
The guy was just doing his job.
You know, he was just trying to be helpful.
You're in a lot of trouble, you know?
My father's gonna have you killed.
Do you realize that?
Tortured first, naturally.
Then he's gonna have you killed.
And what if I let you go?
I don't know. What do you think?
Think he's just gonna forgive you?
Wait a minute.
Why would I ask him to forgive me?
Your father treated me like a piece of shit... like I was nobody... just because I was a cleaner... like I was disposable.
Ahem.
Well, that's the tank full, sir.
Thank you, Walt.
That's for you, Walt.
You're a man, Walt.
Not a slave, not a machine.
Don't let anyone ever treat you otherwise.
Go on.
It's empty.
Let's get this clear.
I'm not gonna hurt you... but I am the kidnapper, and you are the...
Victim.
That's just the way it is.
It's OK.
I've been through this before.
Kidnapped before?
Yeah. I was twelve.
- God, that's terrible.
- It was a long time ago.
So... so how am I doing?
In the kidnap?
Yeah.
So far, you're not doing too bad.
Thank you.
Anyway, I'm just tying you up so you can't escape in the night.
I know that.
Because, of course, you would.
Are you gonna try to have sex with me?
No.
Isn't that what you brought me up here for?
No, it's not.
It didn't even cross your mind?
No. Well... No.
Do you have a problem with sex?
No.
So you're just frightened of it?
No.
- Nervous, then?
- I'm not nervous.
- Then calm down.
- I'm perfectly calm.
I'm just trying to explain... that there's no sexual motives for my actions.
I'm glad we got that cleared up.
So, what did they do next?
They put a needle in my arm and took a pint of blood... and sent it to my father.
The next week they did the same... and the same the next week till he paid up.
He waited six weeks.
That's what happens to the victim.
Around our way
The sun shines bright
Around our way
The birds sing for ya
'Cause they already know ya
Enjoying the book?
No.
What's it about?
It's a romance.
This girl meets this guy.
They fall in love.
It's bullshit.
I'm writing a novel myself.
A lot of people say that, but in my case, it's true.
I'm not interested... in you or your novel... or any other pathetic ambition you have... to change your miserable, mundane existence.
Do you want some exercise?
No.
You can't say no. It's not part of the arrangement.
- I want to read my book.
- You said it was bullshit.
Doesn't mean
I'm not enjoying it.
- You just said you weren't!
- A girl can change her mind.
" She heard his breathing become shallow...
"and a flicker of a smile chased across her lips...
"as she meditated on the power she now held over him.
"'Are you sure you want to catch that flight? '
"she asked."
Do you think they're in love yet?
No.
If they are in love, we can go home.
Tonight, you're mine
I hate it down here.
I hate the air and I hate the food... and I hate the plumbing.
" She pulled him closer, unable to stop."
I ache... all over.
"This, indeed, was perfect love."
I sweat in the heat and ache in the cold.
But will you love me tomorrow?
Why can't we stay someplace decent?
Budget doesn't cover that.
Exactly. Why not?
You know those mysterious ways you keep hearing about, Jackson?
Well, this is one of them.
"...cold, gloating gaze, she let her hand droop down...
"towards the bulge of his passion."
I remember the good old days.
" She heard his breathing become shallow."
All you had to do was introduce a man and a woman.
Nature did the rest.
"She gasped..."
Aah! Fuck!
"with surprise and delight."
Doesn't work like that anymore.
" All of her soul erupted between her thighs...
"as she sensed the firm, exploratory pressure...
"of his warm flesh."
Men and women... it's all gone to shit.
Sure has.
"In the hidden recess of her pelvis...
"their bodies fused into one writhing mass... of torrid, torrid sexual..."
When the night
Meets the morning sun
I'd like to know
That your love
Is a love I can
Be sure of
So tell me now
Mmm.
And I won't ask again
Mmm.
Will you still love me tomorrow?
Mmm.
Aren't you hungry?
I don't eat red meat.
Well, you could eat the vegetables.
They're on the same plate.
So?
I'm not gonna eat this.
Do you eat fish and poultry?
Yes.
But not red meat?
No. Or eggs, unless I know they're free-range.
Then why didn't you tell me you don't like meat?
Because you didn't ask!
And I do like meat.
I just don't eat it.
Moral reasons, if you must know.
If you had taken the time to inquire...
Why are you such a pain to be with?
Because you tied me to a chair all night!
Because I am the victim... and you are the kidnapper, apparently!
Meaning exactly what?
"Kidnap For Beginners"... chapter one... have you even asked for a ransom yet?
Don't say a word until I tell you.
Hello. Mr. Naville? lt... it's me.
Now, I want my...
Me.
The kidnapper!
Right. Now, what I want...
It's not like that.
That's unfair now. I would not...
What are you doing?
No, what are you doing?
I'm negotiating with your father.
- Did you get very far?
- Well, he kept interrupting.
- Right.
- Wouldn't let me finish.
Remember what they didn't teach you... at Harvard Business School, OK?
I didn't go to Harvard Business School.
It's a figure of speech, Robert.
Oh.
Sorry.
Negotiation is a weakness.
You are the kidnapper.
You demand, and he complies.
You go in hard, and you go in fast.
- Hard and fast.
- Right.
I'm you.
You grasp that?
OK.
Pretend it's ringing.
You psych yourself up.
Go to your dark side.
OK. He answers.
All right, you motherfucker,
I've got your daughter here.
I'm sending her back in pieces if I don't get what I want.
I'm gonna pull her fingers out with pliers... and then I'm gonna fry them up for breakfast, understand?
And so on and so on like that, OK?
For no longer than thirty seconds.
What?
Hello there. Mr. Naville?
Now...
Right, you asshole,
I've got your daughter here... and I'm gonna cut her up... and post her home to you in boxes! Small boxes!
Right, daughter,
I've got your asshole here... and I'm gonna send...
Right! Right!
No, I can't speak to anyone!
I need to speak to him!
Hello?
Yeah, I can hold.
Right, listen, you asshole,
I've got your daughter here... and I'm gonna send her back in pieces unless...
Oh, I'm sorry, madam.
No, I must've dialed the wrong number.
No, I haven't got your daughter here.
I have someone else's.
No, we're not married.
Yes, I've read the same thing.
It's very hard to find suitable young men these days.
Well, I'm sure your daughter's very nice.
In principle, I've got no objections to meeting her...
What is the problem?
I think you should just send a letter.
Done this kind of work before?
We do everything.
Eviction and debt collection are our daily bread... but personal retrieval, bounty hunting... you name it, we do it.
How much?
Our fee for the recovery of your daughter is... one hundred thousand dollars.
That's a lot of money.
Five thousand advance.
The rest is cash on delivery.
No daughter, no dough.
Naturally, we operate a sliding scale... whereby if we only bring back part of your daughter... we only get part of the money.
That's enough, Jackson.
If he's cut her ears off, and we can't find them... we'll knock a couple thousand off the tariff.
More for a limb, obviously.
Jackson.
Sorry.
Mr. Naville,
I don't think you need to worry.
My partner is simply envisaging a worst-case scenario.
What about the kidnapper?
You want him, too?
That's extra.
What if he gets in the way?
We'll deal with that situation if it arises.
What if I want him to get in the way?
Let us speak plainly,
Mr. Naville.
You want we should kill him?
Yes.
Uh...
Sir, I must say...
No one's asking you, Mayhew.
Very good, sir.
I am not gonna kill anyone.
If we don't get this job, someone else will.
- Two hundred thousand dollars.
- Including expenses?
Including all expenses... except medical costs... for which you accept full and unlimited responsibility.
Only for the duration of the contract.
- Naturally.
- It's a deal.
Good afternoon.
Hi.
I'm Tod Johnson.
I live up the hill.
That's nice.
I see most things from up there.
Saw you arrive.
Big car, middle of the night.
Right.
Wondered "Who's that?"
Perfectly natural question.
So I asked Felix.
Felix?
Felix is my friend.
He hasn't been the same since the war.
Of course.
I asked him.
I said, " Felix, tell me...
"are they good, or are they evil?"
One bark for good, two for evil.
Felix is a dog?
Do you think that I would talk to a dog?
Do you think
I would ask a dog... whether or not you're good or evil?
What do you think I am... some kind of a crazy backwoods lunatic... with a barn full of human skulls... and a scythe that I sharpen every day... in readiness for Armageddon?
No.
I'm sure you're a regular guy.
Right! I'm regular!
I am a regular man.
I want...
That's not the point!
The point is, who are you?!
Who are you?!
Well, I'm...
We're newlyweds.
Are you coming back to bed soon, darling?
This is Mr. Johnson, dear.
Hello.
Pleased to meet you, ma'am.
You can call me Lucille.
My pleasure, Lucille.
You're not from the newspapers, are you?
I live up the hill.
Oh, good. You can't tell the newspapers we're here.
They never leave us alone, on account of Ritchie.
Ritchie?
You recognize Ritchie, don't you?
Ritchie Vanderlow?
Six gold albums... three platinum.
Fourteen consecutive top-ten singles.
Largest-selling artist worldwide... for the last twelve months?
Ritchie Vanderlow!
You have got to understand, ma'am...
I watch mainly the biblical channels.
It's OK.
We were married in secret... in a castle in Scotland.
That's in England.
Near Paris?
Paris.
Right.
It was so romantic.
We stayed there for our honeymoon... but it wasn't long enough... so we came here for the sake of a little privacy.
Mmm. I see.
Would you like to come in...
Mr. Johnson?
No, I better be on my way.
I have to feed Felix.
OK.
Well... it was a pleasure to meet you,
Mr. Johnson.
See you around.
I'll catch you later then,
Mr. Johnson.
Take care, Ritchie.
Thanks.
This?
The ransom note.
- Right. Anonymous.
- Yeah.
Robert... my father knows who you are.
Oh, I never thought of that.
You are the worst kidnapper
I've ever met.
Oh, and that's all I am to you, isn't it?
The latest kidnapper!
A lifestyle accessory.
And if it doesn't work, it doesn't matter...
'cause you can always get another one.
Quit being so melodramatic.
I'm trying to do my best here... under really difficult circumstances!
It's not made any easier... by you criticizing everything I do!
- How much you asking for?
- Half a million.
- Dollars?
- Yes.
- U.S. Dollars?
- Is there a problem?
Half a million dollars isn't a lot of money for me!
It's not meant to reflect you as an individual.
If word got out I was liberated for half a million...
I could never show my face in polite society again.
Diamonds have no value except that which is placed upon them.
It's more complicated than I thought!
OK, don't worry... all right?
You're trying hard.
You're keen to learn.
That's important.
Let's just not lose sight of the fact... that we have the opportunity... to make millions of dollars here.
We?
Yes, Robert.
You and me.
Is that not a little irregular?
Yes, it is.
Millions?
Please, dad, just give him the money!
He's gonna kill me, daddy!
Please! Just put it in the trunk of the car... two miles south of Palmer, please, daddy!
Daddy!
OK, OK, OK.
OK, OK.
Nice shooting.
Thanks.
Shit.
Aah!
No problem.
Exactly as you predicted.
"Quick, drive my car."
Here's forty dollars.
If you don't mind me asking... how did you know he'd react like that?
It's our job to know things like that.
You done this sort of thing before?
Let's go!
You can take the car, but remember, it's stolen.
Look, they weren't trying to kill you.
They were trying to confuse you and scare you.
Yeah, before they killed me.
And I lost the car, and I didn't get any money.
You can't expect to get everything right the first time.
Look, you are going to be fine.
You are going to be... a success.
Do you think so?
You didn't get caught, right?
No.
No, I didn't get caught.
I fooled them.
I got away.
Maybe we should go out.
Out where?
For a drink.
What, like on a date?
Yeah, like a date.
I wouldn't call it a bad relationship.
No, Lily and I, we just...
You know, we just grew apart as people.
There was no bitterness on either side.
She left you?
No, no, no, no. No!
Yes, she left me.
Mmm.
The aerobics instructor.
How did you know?
You have the demeanor... of a man who's been left for an aerobics instructor.
- I do?
- Yeah.
But be honest.
It was inevitable.
You two weren't suited for one another.
You dream of something better.
She wants it now.
Hence, the gymnast.
Am I right?
Well, yeah.
Yeah. It's a common scenario.
Can I tell you about this dream I have? You're in it.
I'm in your dream?
Now I feel violated.
- Oh, it's not like that.
- I don't wanna hear it.
Perhaps this is a good opportunity... to tell you about my novel.
Look, I'm not interested in your novel.
It's 1962, right?
And Marilyn Monroe... is giving birth to a baby girl.
She's on the phone to Jack Kennedy... saying, " Jack, it's yours.
It's yours, Jack."
So the orphan grows up...
And she solves some great mystery, right?
It's kind of obvious, Robert.
Let's play a game.
If I win...
I go free.
Look, you are free.
The kidnap's over.
You're more a kidnapper than I am Ritchie Vanderlow.
Indulge me, Robert.
Well, if it's what you want.
It's all I ever want.
OK.
You're free.
That's right.
Aren't you gonna leave?
We haven't got our money yet.
Don't take your love to town
Oh, Ruby
For God's sakes, turn around
Big hand! Big hand!
Big hand for local boy
Scottie Sherman.
We are privileged to have here tonight... a very special guest... who is a close personal friend of mine... and I'm gonna ask him to come up here and sing a song.
He is the best-selling artist in the world... with twelve gold albums... sixteen platinum albums... and thirty-two number-one hit singles!
Mr. Ritchie Vanderclaw!
Thank you very much.
My name is Rob...
Ritchie Vanderlow... and, um...
I'd like to sing this song for my beautiful wife...
Aww.
Lucille.
Uh...
Oh, and this is a very special song for us.
Somewhere
Beyond the sea
Somewhere
Waiting for me
My lover stands
On golden sands
And watches the ships
That go sailing
Somewhere
Beyond the sea
She's there
Watching for me
And if I could fly
Like birds on high
Then straight to her arms
I'd go sailing
It's far
Beyond the stars
It's near
Beyond the moon
I know
Beyond a doubt
My heart
Will lead me there
Soon
We'll meet
Beyond the shore
We'll kiss
Just like before
And happy we'll be
Beyond the sea
And never again
I'll go sailing
I know
I know
Beyond a doubt
My heart
Will lead me there
Soon
We'll meet
Touches my heart to see two young people in love.
Happy we'll be
Beyond the sea
And never again
I'll go sailing
Hmm.
Oh, my God. What happened?
You were great.
I was?
Mm-hmm.
I remember drinking tequila.
Certainly was a feature of the evening.
Then I had an incredible dream.
This dream, I've had it before.
You're definitely in it now.
I don't want to hear it.
We were on this game show called Perfect Love.
Never heard of it.
Well, it's just a dream.
I don't think the fact that it's a game show... has any relevance.
It merely indicates my cultural origins.
I mean, were I a tribesman in the Kalahari, for instance... the location would undoubtedly have been different.
But I think the theme is universal.
We're on this game show called Perfect Love.
My life was in danger.
Are you ready?
Am I ready for what?
To write a letter.
Perhaps you'd like to keep this.
We had it analyzed.
It's his handwriting and her blood.
Without our help,
Mr. Naville... that could be the last trace of your daughter you ever see.
He wants a straight switch with no delays.
- I want her back.
- Don't worry. We'll get her.
And I want him dead.
That's understood, Mr. Naville.
Good.
And when this is over,
I want this back.
Bradley was nice, you know?
Extremely wealthy.
Honorable, amusing.
And?
Well, eighty-seven years old.
- Ha ha. Pity.
- Yeah.
Then there was Jake.
He was nice.
Very rich.
Just so conventional.
You see?
Rich guys. Conventional.
It's a problem.
Then there was Angelo.
Twenty-five years old... handsome, healthy... exciting... sophisticated.
Considerate.
So?
Well, I think that we just sort of, um... grew apart as people.
The aerobics instructor?
Like I said... it's a common scenario.
So who was next?
Then I started getting problems with my teeth.
With your teeth?
Yeah, my teeth.
Hey, want a ride?
Hi, thanks for stopping, guys.
Uh, we're not stealing it, we're just borrowing it.
Had that dream again last night.
What dream?
We were on that game show Perfect Love.
- Mmm. Fascinating.
- And my life was in danger.
On a game show?
I know.
It's difficult to explain.
Strange things were happening.
Mmm. So it would appear.
But my life was in danger... and you saved it.
My heart was beating so fast... and then it stopped.
And I was just about to die... and you saved it.
You saved my life.
Well, what are we waiting for?
You want to get on with this or not?
Sure!
You send the girl over.
Ha ha. First the money.
That was the deal.
Are you OK, Miss Naville?
Yes, I'm OK.
I'm just a little frightened.
Now, don't you worry, miss.
Everything'll be all right.
Well?
Whew. It's here.
OK? Send the girl over.
OK, go on.
Ohh, damn.
Aah! Aah!
Aah! Aah! Help!
Get down! Get down!
Yes.
They tied me up! Ohh!
Ha ha!
Don't move a fucking muscle.
Mmm.
What took you?
He shot up the car!
You shot up our car.
Now, what did you do that for?
I was trying to make a getaway.
You were trying to make a getaway?
How is she?
I don't know.
But I don't think it's worked.
They're not... you know?
Jeopardy.
Jeopardy, Jackson... always works.
OK.
This is far enough.
Are you... are you going to kill me?
Yeah.
Well, then I don't see why I should dig.
If you dig...
I promise you when the time comes...
I'll shoot you through the head.
Now, look, you don't like that?
I can just shoot you through the testicles right now.
You can bleed to death.
I'll dig the grave.
It's up to you.
Can you cut me free?
Please?
It's sore.
What's he going to do with him?
Shoot him in the back of the head.
Right.
Would that be a problem for you?
Ever felt like you're not in control of events?
Yes.
No, I mean... something is... destined to happen... and it doesn't?
Like, what happens when the forces of destiny... are no longer in control?
I don't know.
The truth is...
I don't think even he knows what's going on down here... the chaos, the...
This hatred, this violence.
Who...
Who are you talking about?
Jeopardy, Jackson... always works.
Dig.
What are they doing in there?
Should've shot him myself.
Yeah, well, you can't trust them to do anything.
I take it you're not in a love situation.
What?
I mean you're not in love.
What's it to you?
Nothing.
Just asking.
I like it like that
And I know it
That's OK. You can stop now.
No.
I've waited long enough.
No.
Give me that. Lie down.
No, no. No!
Give it to me! Give it to me!
Please!
- Please.
- Shh.
Aah!
Leave it all behind
I commit you to his mercy.
Please. Please. Please.
Aah!
Aah! Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
No! No!
Get up!
Robert, get off!
Who are they?
Come on!
That's what keeps me
That's what keeps me
That's what keeps me down
Aah!
Ohh.
Just for a minute there,
I thought we were in trouble.
I told you don't get caught.
Don't get out of the car.
Don't ever go into the woods with a stranger.
- I know. You're right.
- I'm always right, OK?
You might like to remember that.
Have you got the money?
- Aah!
- Aah!
No! Jesus!
I'm going to get you.
Aah!
Ohh!
Shit.
- Oh, shit.
- Where is she?
Oh, shit.
Drive!
Ohh!
Ohh!
Jesus!
- Jump!
- What?
Jump!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
If the card's no good,
I'm authorized to destroy it.
It's my card, lady.
Listen, you don't understand.
- Is there a problem?
- I'm sorry about this, ma'am.
Don't worry. Don't worry.
I've got some cash, OK?
Thirty dollars, sir.
Thank you.
How could he do a thing like that?
Stay calm, OK?
My own father.
He canceled my credit card.
I've never been so humiliated in all my life.
- I know exactly how you feel.
- You couldn't possibly know.
Only the exceptionally rich can know how I feel right now.
Don't take it personally.
Is he trying to say
I'll find my own natural level?
Sink to the bottom like her?
Like who?
Who are you talking about?
Pull over.
Oh, no.
Oh, no, no, no.
Live a little.
This is insane.
Stop worrying so much.
It'll be my first time, too.
That's what I'm worrying about.
Trust me.
I know what I'm doing.
Next.
Hello.
I'd like to make a withdrawal.
I thought we agreed... no clichés.
Fill the bag.
Oh, my God, she's got a gun!
Leave my daughter alone.
Please, leave her alone!
- Don't be silly.
- She's going to kill her!
She's not going to kill your daughter.
- Yes, I am.
- What?
Shut up.
Christ, no!
Everybody calm down..., or this girl's brains will splatter the wall.
- Fill the bag!
- Celine!
You shut up especially.
You can't hold the girl hostage.
What?
Oh, no!
You didn't find it difficult.
- That was different.
- Was it?
Didn't feel different.
It felt just like this.
Now do you understand how it felt, Robert?
But you, unlike me, couldn't pull the trigger.
- Oh, no.
- Good-bye, Robert.
OK, kill me, but don't touch the girl!
Extremely amusing!
" Kill me, but don't touch the girl."
Robert, you should be on television.
- Very funny.
- What's wrong?
What's wrong? I thought you were going to shoot me!
That's what's wrong!
Shoot you? I wouldn't do that.
- Oh, no?
- No! I'm having a great time!
- Oh, good!
- Yeah, certainly is!
What's wrong?
Celine, it's over.
Aah!
I'm dying, Celine.
I think I'm dying, and I don't want to die.
You're not going to die.
I don't want to die.
Are you taking me to a hospital?
Because I don't want to die in a hospital.
I'm not going to take you to a hospital.
What do you mean, you're not taking me to a hospital?
Take me to a hospital!
Where are you taking me?
Very nice.
Very nice, indeed.
You could have a perfect smile.
For two thousand dollars, you could change your life.
No, thanks.
Do you think a perfect smile just happens?
Is that what you think? Huh?
Do you think that Celine's smile is her own?
No, it's not.
It's mine.
I gave it to her... just like I can give you one.
I'll fix your teeth for twelve thousand dollars.
I didn't get shot in the teeth.
Well, let me tell you something.
It wouldn't have made too much difference if you had.
I don't want to say anything.
It's your teeth, but if you wait another year... you'll have fifty grand worth of major reconstruction, so...
If you wait another year... he'll be dead.
Sorry. Just a little free consultation.
You know, they wanted me to take a break.
Take a break.
Go get counseling, you know?
Fuck them. What do they know?
They wanted me to stay in the hospital.
I discharged myself this afternoon.
Lucky for you that I did, huh?
OK.
Have you, um, done this before?
The principles of surgery... are the same above and below the neck.
Aah! Aah!
Aren't you going to anesthetize me?
I'm sure you'll pass out as the pain gets worse.
Aah!
Aah!
Give me another one.
Here we go, baby.
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yaah!
Give it to me hot.
You look lovely.
Thank you.
Give me the Bambi, baby.
That's it.
God!
OK, turn over. Turn over.
- What?
- Turn over, darling.
Turn...
There you go.
Flash me the tush.
One heel.
Excellent.
Mmm.
Robbie!
Hey, how are you? Come on.
Join the party.
Come on.
Do you want some champagne?
How rude of me. Excuse me, love.
Oh, wait.
Here you go.
Here. Look at that.
So, I understand that you're...
Here, please.
I understand that you're something of a fugitive.
Don't be shocked.
We go back a long way.
Oh, I see. You're her dentist.
Yup. That's right.
We met over that particularly fine set of ivories.
In fact...
I gave her her first filling.
Ohh!
Fuck.
Oh, I wish you hadn't done that.
Now I have to hurt you... which is inconvenient and undignified.
Ohh!
Fucker.
Get up!
Leave him alone, Elliot.
Why don't you stay out of this?
Are you all right?
Uhh!
Gaah!
Uhh! Aah!
You want to explain to me... exactly what you were trying to achieve back there?
How about you do some explaining to me?
I didn't want you bleeding to death... and I think I saved your life.
I'd rather have died than have witnessed that.
Witnessed what, exactly?
You and Elliot in an advanced state of foreplay.
He would've passed out drunk in five minutes... if you hadn't come along.
Yeah, sure.
Even if we were about to get physical... what's it got to do with you anyway?
Aah.
You thought we had something?
It's possible.
But why?
Why do we have to have something?
We were getting along just fine.
Having something ruins everything.
What will you do now, ask me to marry you?
Of course I'm not.
- You thought about it.
- Don't be absurd.
It never even occurred to you?
Well, it wouldn't be so bad.
You see what I mean?
Just forget it.
Consider it forgotten.
Where do you want to go?
Don't care.
Do you want to get out of the car?
- Are you asking me to get out?
- No. I'm asking if you want to.
- It's the same thing.
- It's not the same thing.
One is a request, the other is a question.
Fine. If that's what you want, then I'll get out.
If that's what you want, go right ahead.
And don't even ask where I'm going!
Don't even imagine that I care.
Exactly the problem!
Where's the love gone to?
Don't leave
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You got me hurtin'
Don't leave
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
You know it's never been easy
To love someone like me
Oh, oh
Don't leave
Yeah, yeah
Fuck.
Where did all the love go?
Where's the love gone to?
Stop hovering over me.
I can't concentrate.
Have you written anything yet?
I... I...
What am I supposed to write?
Love letters, Jackson, deal with the subject of love.
I need time to think.
We don't have time.
Every day they spend apart... the more difficult it's going to be.
And if Naville finds our boy... he's just meat.
Maybe I didn't treat you...
So, think, Jackson... have you ever done this before?
Back when I was alive, there was a girl.
You wrote to some girl?
A long time ago.
You never told me about this.
It never came to nothing.
Her father did not approve our match.
It was just young love, but I wrote... many times... with passion... and despair.
You were always on my mind
Maybe I didn't hold you
I never knew you had a romantic soul.
All those lonely, lonely nights
I often wonder what became of that girl... sweet Eliza.
Eliza...
Gray.
Her father was a colonel.
Jackson, you're qualified.
You can write this letter.
That's the problem, see?
I wrote to her, sure, but I didn't write letters.
Well, what, then?
As a matter of fact...
I... wrote... love poems.
Tell me that your sweet love
Tell me that your sweet love
Hasn't died
Give me
Give me one more chance
To keep you satisfied
Remember, my dear... they only want one thing.
Maybe they want it more than once... but it's still only one thing.
Little things
I should have said
And done
I just never took the time
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
I wish you had let me read that poem.
A poem... is a very personal document.
I hope it was a good one.
That's all I'm saying.
Because if she don't like it, she won't come.
And if she don't come, we're stuck.
It's her.
- I got your poem.
- Sorry?
Your poem... the one you wrote me.
Poem?
"Oh, desert me, wretched loneliness...
"and bring me back my love...
"for she and I have parted...
"and the sky is up above."
It worked.
She loves it.
" Your limbs so svelte and slender..."
"Your touch...
"so soft and tender."
"But the bits that I like best...
"are the bits that..."
I'm not going to read that line.
Jackson, Jackson, what the hell did you write?
It was a...
Yeah?
A simple poetic reference... uh, to...
Celine.
Please.
Last verse.
"Just as the flowers blossom...
"in the gaze of the shining sun..."
"I would be most honored..."
"if you would bear my son."
Robert, no one has ever written me a poem before.
All those guys I dated, they didn't care about me.
They just wanted to own this.
Huh?
I would never open my heart to any of those guys.
And before I met you...
I never believed that there was any alternative.
Oh!
I knew it!
But when you stopped that bullet...
Ha ha ha ha! and got the wrong idea about Elliot...
I knew it!
I should've understood.
- Celine...
- No. Let me finish.
This is difficult for me to say... but I feel I can trust you.
I didn't write the poem.
What?
I didn't write it.
I've never written a poem in my life.
How can anybody be that honest?
It's his handwriting.
Tell him it's his handwriting.
But it's your handwriting.
It... it has this address.
It even has some sort of cheap aftershave on the paper.
I didn't write the poem, OK?
Oh, my God.
Celine, no need to...
Human fucking beings.
What do you have to do?
We did everything for them!
Brought them together.
Put them in jeopardy.
We damn near killed them both!
We gave them every opportunity.
All they had to do was fall in love... and we could've gone home.
Maybe we failed, Jackson... but we don't have to live like this.
Is she gone?
Yeah.
Nice-looking woman.
She isn't my type.
What are you talking about?
Look at yourself.
You're nobody.
You're nothing.
You're wanted in connection with a violent crime.
You're cleaning the floor of a diner.
She is an intelligent, passionate... beautiful rich woman.
The issue of whether or not she's your type... is not one that you are likely... to have to resolve in this world.
She's there watching for me
Or indeed the next, since she will be going to some heaven... for glamorous pussy... and you will be cleaning the floor of a diner... in hell.
I guess so.
So why are you even thinking about it?
I don't know.
Stupid...
Come on.
Finish the floor.
What the fuck?
Aah!
Shut up!
Where's my beautiful poem?
Your father's not home yet.
I don't expect he'll pay our ransom straight off.
Not till we send a few fingers through the mail.
Ooh.
Sixteen.
I'm gonna stick right there.
Say, how about you?
You want a hit?
No.
Mmm, stay.
- Uh-huh?
- No.
- Hit?
- No!
Now, Miss Naville... you've got a five-card trick,
Miss Naville. you've got a five-card trick,
Miss Naville.
You can stick right there... and you got four thousand dollars.
Mm-hmm.
But you want another hit? OK.
No, no!
- What is that?
- Answer it, Jackson.
I can't do that.
I'm playing blackjack.
She might cheat while I'm out of the room.
All right.
I'll answer the door.
You play blackjack with the hostage.
You sure you want to increase your bet... before you take another hit?
No!
No!
OK.
No!
And...
No!
Aah!
Well...
There.
It's just as well we're not playing for real.
Come on!
All right, now cut her free.
Aah!
What the hell did you do to her?
I punched her in the face.
Oh! Ow!
Oh, you punched her in the face.
She's half your size, and you punch her?
- She had a gun!
- Oh, she had a gun?
So that makes everything all right, does it?
I'm not saying it makes everything all right.
I'm just trying to explain that for all I knew... she could have been a karate expert or something.
With a broken arm?
With a broken arm?!
OK. I'm sorry.
Now just cut her free!
You son of a bitch!
- Celine?
- What do you want?
I'm just trying to explain.
Aah!
Despite your crummy poem...
I came to visit and all you could do... was humiliate me and turn me away.
I thought you were decent.
I thought you were different, but you're not.
You're just a lying, cheating son of a bitch... just like all the rest!
Celine,
I never meant to hurt you!
I don't know who wrote that poem... but I'll tell you, those are my feelings.
Oh, sure.
Not so easy now, huh?
Celine, Celine!
When you left the diner last night...
I realized
I'd turned away the woman... whom I'd spent the happiest... most exciting times of my life with... who I care for more than anyone on the earth!
Listen, listen!
Do you remember that dream I had?
I dreamed that my life was in danger... that my heart stopped.
But you saved my life... when you pierced my heart with an arrow of your love.
And that's the truth.
Celine, what I'm saying is that I love you.
What? What did you say?
What I was trying to say was that I...
Oh, shit.
What?
Who is that?
Don't worry, Miss Celine.
Everything's going to be just fine.
Aah!
Well, we're not just gonna leave them here, are we?
No, sir.
Come in.
Yes, there is a
Deeper river
That will bring you
Home again
Oh, there is a
Deeper river
Flowing under
I don't think they're coming back.
Isn't there anything you can do?
I don't have the authority to intervene.
Deeper river
I don't have the authority to intervene!
That will bring you
Home again
Let me out of this trunk now!
Robert, he's gonna kill you!
Just run.
He doesn't want the money, OK?
He's gonna kill you!
Just run, Robert, run!
It's probably in the canoe, Mr. Naville.
That's probably where it is.
It's not in the canoe, sir... but I think it's, uh, upstairs.
I think it's upstairs.
Might've put it there.
They probably left it under the bed.
That would be a good place.
Tsk tsk tsk.
I don't think he has it...
Mr. Naville.
No. I... that's it!
That's where it is!
That's where it was.
I put it under that board.
I'll have your money back to you in a minute, Mr. Naville, sir.
Board up, and then we'll get it back to you.
We're just gonna have to face the truth, Robert.
You don't have my money.
Yeah, it's down here, all right, Mr. Naville, sir.
Just where I left it.
And frankly, I don't care.
It's just a detail.
You'll have your money back in a second, sir.
Long as you understand that it isn't the money.
It's the principle.
Somebody please just let me out of here!
Mayhew, not with the ax.
This is Gabriel.
Get me God.
Let's go. Come on!
Come on, come on!
Robert, what happened was you shot them, and then you...
Did he just move?
No, sir.
In all respect, sir, how could anything be beyond your control?
Anyway, you shot them... then you shot...
You sure he didn't move?
I'm quite sure, sir.
Yes, sir.
No, sir.
Sir?
Please.
Yeah, quite.
Yeah, right.
Mayhew, she's moved.
She's moved.
I saw it with my own eyes.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.
They are both dead, sir.
I shot them myself.
I won't disturb you again.
Yahoo!
Who's that?
Robert?
You shot them... and then you shot yourself, and then... you set fire to this cabin.
Didn't you?
Not yet, he didn't.
Celine.
Why...
Why don't you just put that gun down, hmm?
Do not get in my way, father.
Celine... you're not responsible for your actions.
You're unhinged.
You need the best psychiatric treatment... that money can buy... just like your mother.
So why don't you just...
Why don't you just give me the gun?
Because as he dreamt...
I shall save his life with an arrow... an arrow of my love for him.
Kill him, Mayhew.
Ezekiel!
He's alive, Mayhew.
They're all alive.
If I were your woman
And you were my man
You'd have no other woman
You'd be weak as a lamb
If you had the strength
To walk out that door
My love would overrule my sense
And I'd call you back for more
If I were your woman
So you're telling me that successful relationships... are made in heaven?
Not founded on the daily practicality... of two people being prepared... to tolerate the imperfections of one another?
It's not successful relationships, Celine.
It's love. And it comes from a strange and wonderful place... that we don't know about.
So you also reject the idea... that love is merely an emotional adaptation... to a physical necessity?
Completely.
Are you serious?
Fate intervenes in people's lives.
In ours, for instance.
Fate brought us together.
It kept us together.
We were destined for one another.
Fate had a pretty strange way of making its point.
But that's part of the beauty of it.
It's inexplicable, unpredictable... and absolutely beyond control or understanding.
But you nearly got killed.
But I didn't... and here we are.
Do you have any substantial evidence to back all this?
None at all.
And you realize that it's absurd and irrational?
I know that.
Then why do you believe it?
Because, Celine, I'm a dreamer.
Well, I guess that makes two of us.
Are you ready?
As I'll ever be.
Then let's go.
But I'm too afraid to show it
If I were your woman
If you were my woman
If I were your woman
If you were my woman
If I were your woman
If you were my woman
Never, no, no, no
Stop loving you
Oh, yeah
If I were your woman
Do you know what I'd do?
I'd never, never, never stop loving you
If I were your woman
Your sweet loving woman
If you were my woman
If I were your woman
If you were my woman
I'd be your only woman
If you were my woman
If I were your woman
If you were my woman
You'd need no other woman
You'd need no other woman
All clear.
So, how was it?
Believe me, Gabriel.
You don't want to know.
- But it worked.
- Yeah.
Love... worked.
Ameratus pathum laborium.
Are we going home now?
We're going home.
At last.
Ohh!
The paper boy is looking before he goes
Lying to the teacher who knows he knows
He didn't, and he should've brought his lines in yesterday
Ernie bangs the sound as the day begins
The letterbox is open, and your cash falls in
Aah!
I'll meet you at the office just before the staff clock in
Round our way
The birds are singing
Round our way
The sun shines bright
Aah!
Round our way
The birds sing for you
'Cause they already know you
Yeah, they already know you
The game is kicking off in around the park
It's twenty-five a side, and before it's dark
There's gonna be a loser
And you know the next goal wins
Cab it to the front
As it's called a draw
Everybody's knocking at yours once more
Ernie bangs the sound
And no one's spoken since half past four
La la la la la la la
Round our way the birds are singing
Round our way the sun shines bright
Round our way the birds sing for you
'Cause they already know you
Yeah, they already know you
On the highway
Unpaved
Going my way
You're so alone today
Like a ghost town
I found there's no relief
No soul to mercy
Is it true what they say?
You can't behave
You gamble your soul away
Measuring your dreams
Oh, this life seems
Like the gristle of loneliness
Do do do do
Don't let the sun catch you crying
Do do do do do
Don't let the sun catch you crying
Like an ice age
Nice days on your way
Sipping the golden dregs
On a riptide
Freaks ride
Sleep inside
A parasite's appetite
Oh, say, can't you see
The chemistry?
The parasites, the cleanup fee
Death metal hands
Recycled cans
Get well cards to the hostage vans
Don't let the sun catch you crying
Do do do do do
Don't let the sun catch you crying
I got a magical ray
That reads you like a book, yeah
You got a mystic pen that sends me the message
Tests of my strength
Are pretty much all I know
For the rest of my life,
I will be climbing somewhere
Climbing
Climbing
Somewhere
Somewhere
And I have no fear
I have no fear
'Cause love is here
Love is here
Love is here
Love is here
Love is...
Did you know that I'm looking at you now
With a daisy in my hair
Roses in my hand
And broken rhythms in disrepair
I hear
A danger in the air
For the rest of my life,
I will be climbing somewhere
Climbing
Climbing
Somewhere
Subtitles by LeapinLar
We're running out of time.
We have polluted and peopled this planet
to the brink of extinction.
We are destroying our world at a suicidal pace.
We need a pollution revolution.
And it's not going to be easy
because the world is addicted to petroleum.
We have limited resources
and we go to war to protect them.
We need a new technology
and this technology
can't be sold.
It must be given away to everyone.
We are in sight of a dream.
There is a solution.
The answer is all around us... right here.
Water. H2O.
Two parts hydrogen, one part oxygen.
There is enough energy in this glass of water to power the city of Chicago for weeks.
It's the hydrogen we're after.
This is what happens when we burn it.
It's perfectly clean.
You can burn it when you want to, in a car, in a turbine,
or in your own basement power supply next to your water heater.
But what if we could release this energy efficiently?
We will transform the world.
Maybe we start to put an end to war.
Of course, we have to make it work first.
Morning!
Hey, James, how are you doing?
Hey, Eddie, cold enough for you?
It's never too cold.
Hey, Lu! You want me to set up?
Yeah, right away.
Hello, Mr Shannon.
Mr Shannon, the big man, how are you?
Alistair.
- Did you have a good trip?
- Very good.
- Hi, can I get you some coffee?
- I'm fine, thank you.
I turn on the laser here.
We should focus it in the centre of the bubble.
- How's it going?
- You didn't get my fax?
I did. I didn't understand the figures.
We need to control the bubble.
The regulator isn't working.
Eddie, did you computer-model your work last night?
No, I was too busy building it.
We sustained fusion for 4.6 milliseconds.
Stable?
It's stable... for 4.6 milliseconds.
Let me show you. Come, come.
The power input and output is fine at this stage.
The output drops to nothing at stage three, so what happened?
Paul!
All right, I gotta go.
Cross your fingers, everyone.
Good luck.
Mr Chen. Initiate laser.
Initiate laser.
Hydrogen separation in progress.
Initiate hydrogen burn.
Two million kelvin and rising.
Shut it down!
It's unstable. Shut it down.
We learned something important.
We found another way that didn't work.
We need to keep our minds open and try again.
Alistair.
- It's working.
- Is it stable?
Yeah, it's stable.
- Completely stable.
- My God!
- We go tomorrow.
- Tomorrow, Alistair.
Lily, talk to me.
Temperature, gas flow, acoustic drive steadied.
- The regulator has stabilised the reaction.
- Lucasz.
My spectrometer shows stable hydrogen production.
We're getting more out than we put in.
I think you'd better sell your utility stocks.
- Whoa, Mr Chidi!
- Unbelievable!
You're going to be famous.
Thanks for everything.
We want more money!
Thanks for your trust.
I got it, I got it!
Here comes crazy Eddie!
Congratulations. I am quite impressed.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
I never agreed to keep anything from anyone.
Mandela will get this information,
China will find out...
Go anywhere, but don't move an inch.
I can't tell you what could happen...
This is no time to be serious.
Everybody's waiting.
Come on, Alistair!
OK, everybody.
Holy shit, we did it!
Holy shit, we did it!
One love
One heart
Let's get together and...
Your battery's dead.
There's ice all over the dashboard.
- How do I get home?
- I'll get you home.
We'll take my bike.
Oh, yes, please!
Where do you live?
I live in England.
No, sorry, I live on Kimbark and 54th.
- Kimbark and 54th?
- Mm-hm.
We can't. You'll freeze to death.
Erm...
Let's take a taxi.
- Taxi, huh?
- Uh-huh.
We've got a better chance of getting picked up by a UFO.
Mr Chen, upload everything.
I want it on the Internet tonight.
We'll wake up a lot of people.
Damn right. Really wake them up.
Barkley...
We don't have the computer model ready.
We have the frequency.
We'll send it to you in one hour.
Yeah, yeah, in one hour.
Where are you going?
Chen?
- Here we are.
- This is Alistair's house.
Isn't he sweet?
He lets me live on the third floor.
Mmm. This... way.
Is this... is this what drunk is?
You've never been drunk?
I've never been this.
Lily's too serious.
She's no fun.
I think you're fun.
Good night, Lily.
Wow!
Alistair!
Alistair!
Chen!
Chen!
Chen!
Get ready.
Shannon.
- Paul? Alistair's dead.
- Eddie?
I found him on the lab floor.
- He was murdered.
- What?
Just what caused the explosion last night is still unclear.
University officials say this mill site had been converted for the experimental production of hydrogen fuel.
They say that's not supposed to be dangerous.
One question law enforcement officials are trying to determine is whether foul play was involved.
As we indicate, that's unconfirmed.
But an FBI agent has said, and it was reported by a Bureau spokesperson, that no nuclear device went off.
There was no atomic explosion.
As far as you know, are all your people accounted for?
Miss Sinclair? Is this all the group?
Alistair didn't come home last night.
Lu Chen is nowhere to be found.
I phoned him and he's not anywhere.
I started CPR.
I checked for breath, there was no breath.
I checked and there was no pulse.
I continued with the CPR.
Have the locals move the perimeter back about 1,000 ft.
You got it.
Find me a friendly Federal judge.
I want wiretap orders, search warrants on everyone that worked here.
Inspector Ford, you've taken charge of this investigation.
Why is the FBI involved?
Eight city blocks disappeared.
The President talked to my boss at 3am.
He wants answers.
Tell me about Eddie.
Does he drink, do drugs?
No. He's just a machinist, an undergraduate working to get his degree.
That's the undisclosed cost of our cheap fossil fuel.
Who'd be interested in this?
Cheap, clean, abundant energy?
Who wouldn't?
When you left the party, who was there?
Eddie.
So, Eddie, tell us again why you came back?
I'd come back for my bike.
You say you'd returned from taking Miss Sinclair home.
Yeah. Her car wouldn't start, so I took her home on the bus.
What is your relationship with Miss Sinclair?
Er... We work together.
I'm a machinist, she's a physicist.
I was hired by Dr Chen.
And who is Dr Chen?
He was Dr Barkley's project manager.
Why did he hire you?
Because I'm a physicist.
Gentlemen, what have we got here?
Sergeant?
I think we have Mr Chen in the wind.
Nick, what did you find?
It looks like he packed with a shovel.
He was in a hurry.
Dr Barkley expressed interest in a specialist in sonoluminescence.
He knew about Dr Chen.
So through some friends in the State Department,
I got him here and onto the team.
You have friends in the State Department?
We have influential members of the board.
Really?
Who's on the board of your foundation?
Ford.
Various scientists...
Yeah.
...and industrialists.
Your Dr Chen is missing.
Any idea where he might be?
He may be dead.
We have no comment.
Eddie Kasalivich!
You said they killed him.
Who killed him, Eddie?
You were there before the explosion.
What happened?
What are you looking for?
We're just examining the articles on his desk.
- How are you entitled to do that?
- Annette!
They have a search warrant, but no respect for a man's life.
I want a full inventory.
These are very important, sensitive scientific papers.
- We'll give you copies.
- Signed, please!
For two decades, Doctor Barkley...
I have to speak to the university's legal counsel.
Please give Lily any help you can.
I can't stay here tonight.
Among the missing is Dr Lu Chen, who the authorities are looking for.
He may be considered a suspect...
- This is insane.
- They're going to think he did it.
Oh, no.
- What is it?
- It's from
Dr Lu Chen.
He wants me to bring the rest of the information, all the data and meet him at the rendezvous in Shanghai.
I'm being framed.
What are you talking about?
- This isn't from Chen.
- How do you know?
- He doesn't write like this.
- Then who sent it?
I don't know who sent it.
Where's Chen?
You don't think he did it?
Let's er...
Let's get outta here, OK?
Can I help you?
I sure hope so.
We're looking for Mr Paul Shannon.
He's on the phone right now.
Excuse me, you can't go in there!
You can't go in!
There's a lot to explain.
I'll call you back.
What now, Agent Ford?
We've received Eddie Kasalivich's file.
He left college for disciplinary reasons.
He blew the hell out of the lab.
- This is a coincidence!
- You knew he was kicked out of school?
He resigned.
- Under some pressure?
- There was some pressure, yes.
- He blows up a building...
- Minor structural damage.
It was an interesting experiment.
It might have worked.
Didn't you think this information was important?
I don't see the relevance.
- You don't see a small connection?
- No, Agent Ford, I don't.
The CIA tells me
Chen might be involved in espionage.
Kasalivich's past makes me nervous.
And Miss Sinclair is receiving faxes inviting her to mainland China.
Really?
Really.
What's wrong?
That's my place.
Let's get outta here.
- It's a real shithole.
- How much does this guy make?
Not much, he's a student machinist.
- Sheen, why are you outside?
- Stay warm, buddy!
Got a loft for your mother.
Very artistic.
- Who's upstairs?
- Everybody. Half the city.
- Do you want to check that cabinet?
- I got it.
Jesus, you could put together almost anything here.
I want all this.
All right! We need a total lab workup.
It's er... a neutron cappuccino machine.
Yeah, don't touch it.
Hey, Nick! What's this?
It's a transmitter.
It's a burst transmitter.
What does it do?
It sends massive amounts of information by satellite probably to China.
Nick! Doyle!
Calls flooded into the University Of Chicago
from all over the world, enquiring about the professor.
Concern came from the Royal Academy in London,
from Paris, Moscow and all parts of the compass.
But at the same time, critics say Barkley was a Utopian dreamer.
They point out that the research he was involved with
was far more dangerous than he realised.
Paul.
Shannon!
What's going on?
Tell me about the money, Eddie.
What money?
The $250,000 the FBI found in your loft.
I don't know what you're talking about.
What about the burst transmitter?
Think hard.
Jesus...
I suppose you're not in communication with Dr Chen in China?
It wasn't Chen.
- Do you have an attorney?
- No.
I've got a good one.
He'll negotiate your surrender.
Come on. We'll call him.
- Surrender?
- They'll want to talk to you.
- I'm not going.
- What do you mean?
- We didn't do anything.
- The FBI will figure that out.
We're being set up. I'm not going to the cops until I know more.
Run, and you'll have every gun-carrying idiot in the US after you.
Look, talk to this lawyer.
We'll go somewhere safe
- and wait until you work it out.
- Where?
Maggie's.
We'll go to Maggie's.
OK. Have you got any money?
- All right.
Here.
When you get there, stay put.
Don't use the phone. I'll call you.
Why is this happening, Paul?
It's gonna be all right, Eddie.
I promise you.
Wait here five minutes, then leave.
What do we know about this Shannon?
Georgetown Law,
Kennedy School of Government.
Worked for several aerospace giants.
Three years in Washington under Reagan...
- Oh, yeah? Doing what?
- DARPA.
Defence Advanced Research
Project Administration.
Jesus! Who the hell is this guy?
He's notjust someone that runs a foundation.
There's a train at 8.40 at the Union Station to Williams Bay.
- That's where Maggie lives.
- You can trust her?
We lived and worked together.
This is the Channel 32 special report.
We go live to the Federal Office Building in Chicago.
As you know, it's been a very long and a very trying day for us all.
Material witness warrants have been issued in Illinois for Professor Lu Chen,
Dr Lily Sinclair, and Edward Kasalivich.
Oh, my God!
If anyone knows their whereabouts, please contact the Chicago FBI office.
What are we going to do?
We can't leave here together.
Get a cab outside. Buy two tickets.
Williams Bay. I'll meet you on the track.
Be safe.
You too.
His body was found...
Hey, Mike, did you see that guy?
Union Station, please.
Hey! Hey, you! Come here.
Hey!
Officer!
Hey, buddy!
Hey, you!
I got him! I got him!
It makes no sense.
If Kasalivich is just a pawn, why has he got a burst transmitter?
What?
He's gotta be transmitting to someone.
- Unbelievable.
- What?
CPD's chasing Kasalivich down Michigan Avenue.
Stay where you are!
He's gonna fall! Get me a boat under there!
What the hell's he doing?
He's going over!
Hey! We got guys downstairs?
- What did I tell you? He just went over.
- Stairs, over here.
Listen. How do we get him down?
Officer, if I move that bridge, he's gonna fall.
- Can he get out lower down?
- Leads down to the gear room.
- Bring the bridge down.
- He'll get crushed.
Ten-four. Bring it down slow.
- Bring the bridge down now!
- Get over there!
Hey! What's happening? Why did it stop?
Right, I want this cleared.
Let's go! Do a search!
Move it, move it!
Go! Go! Right now!
You! Back this thing outta here. Come on!
So where the hell is he?
Amtrak northbound, no.343,
now leaving on track 19
for Fox Lake, Wallburgh, Williams Bay,
Jamesfield and Madison.
- God! I didn't think I was gonna make it.
- Watch your step.
Don't worry, he'll be here.
You were right.
What took you so long?
The bridge was up.
All aboard!
- Here you go.
- Thanks.
Thank you.
Are you sure she's going to be up this late?
Yeah, she's usually up all night.
- She's kinda wild.
- Oh.
- I worked up here one summer.
- Oh!
Maggie.
Maggie!
Oh, my.
Tell me you didn't do it, Eddie!
I didn't do it.
Oh, it's good to see you, man.
You must be the other terrorist.
- I guess I am.
- Maggie, this is Lily.
Hi, Lily.
- Have a nice trip, Mr Shannon.
- Thank you, Bobby.
How did you get me into this hearing?
I don't have this kind of clearance.
I know a guy that knows a guy.
- Who?
- It's a guy.
Who's the guy?
Doyle, it's national security. I can't tell you.
Security concerns must be given greater importance in industrial research.
We don't know the cause of the explosion.
And we don't know the source of the espionage, if indeed there was espionage.
But we do know that we are at risk.
Every idea that offers a competitive advantage to Americans is subject to theft.
And that, gentlemen, could be catastrophic.
Mr Shannon, over the past ten years, this committee has approved hundreds of millions of dollars for your research projects without having one good, goddamn idea about where the hell all the money was going.
He's talking about our tax dollars up there.
We were under the impression, Senator, that you passed legislation to ensure that you wouldn't know.
Or perhaps, more accurately, that you didn't want to know.
I'm aware of the law, Mr Shannon, thank you. I wrote it.
But I don't remember, when I drafted it, that I anticipated a large portion of the south side of Chicago blown up.
What assurances can you give me and this committee that this event will never happen again?
None, Senator.
The incident in Chicago was tragic, to be sure.
But sometimes that is the price we must pay to ensure our competitive edge in the future.
We didn't intend to pay for our space exploration programme with the lives of ten American astronauts.
But we did.
Nevertheless, we must not waver in our commitment to scientific research and development.
As you gentlemen know, there are many threats to our way of life.
And not all of them wear uniforms and carry guns.
Mr Shannon, I want to thank you for your appearance today before this committee.
You have spoken like a true patriot of whom this country can be very proud.
Thank you, sir.
- I think I'm getting through.
- What about Lucasz?
He never got over not getting his credentials.
No-one on the team could have done this.
Whoever is doing this knows an awful lot about us.
If I hadn't have shown up, they would have thought it was an accident.
And nobody would know what's really going on.
Oh, my God.
- Welcome back, boss. We missed you.
- What about me?
Surveillance is up on Shannon's estate.
Cue it up, Jimmy.
Where are the files on the Moore Foundation?
Gentlemen,
Shannon's moving.
There will be an orientation meeting
in the main auditorium, on level one...
- Is everyone here?
- Yes.
- Is it running?
- Not yet.
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
FBI. I'm Agent Williams, this is Agent Lim.
So, what kind of facility is this?
I'm sorry, sir, we're not allowed to discuss this.
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
Bear with me, and we'll soon get started.
Thank you.
I don't care if he's got an appointment with Mother Teresa.
We have been waiting for him for 35 minutes.
You're late.
This is another one of your messes, Lyman.
It's not the Peace Corps, Paul.
- Anyway, you said you had it under control.
- I did!
This thing's still not working.
You've got to call off the Bureau.
Do you understand?
I'm not sure I can do that.
There's an awful lot of explaining to do.
Where's the young man?
Kasalivich?
He's someplace safe.
I'm bringing him in today.
Paul!
If someone's going down for this, it is not gonna be I.
Paul Shannon, please.
Maggie McDermott. We're old friends.
Washington.
Area code's Wisconsin. Checking the prefix.
Punch it up.
Maggie McDermott. She was put through from the Chicago office.
Maggie?
Shannon, it's Eddie.
It's scrambled.
- It's him, on a payphone in Williams Bay.
- I'll get the locals.
- What are you doing?
- It's OK, it's a payphone. That fax...
I know about that.
Wait at Maggie's.
I'll send someone for you.
Lily tracked it to Beijing.
It routed through a Chinese company, but it came from the US Technological Business Council.
We've gotta go.
- Heard of it?
- They'll be there in an hour.
Now, Eddie!
- I gotta go. We'll come to you.
- No, don't.
Eddie. Eddie!
- Thanks.
- Good luck.
Officer. Hey, hey! Andy!
You know that guy on the news?
I saw him run up there.
Really, Maggie?
You should have brought him in when you had the chance.
Get to the observatory, right away!
Lily! Lily!
- Eddie, it's unbelievable.
- We've gotta go.
Listen, listen. This council lobbies for defence contractors...
- We've gotta go now. The cops are here.
- What!
Come on!
How did they find us?
Hey! Hold it right there.
Hey!
Hold it! Hey!
Stop!
Hold it!
Stop! Hold it right there.
Get your hands up.
Get 'em up!
Walk back slowly towards me.
Come on, do it!
Keep coming.
Good, hold it right there.
This is Nemitz, on the roof of the observatory.
I've got 'em.
Aagh!
Go! Go, go, go, go!
Come on!
On the roof!
Get a medical team up here right away.
Suspect is armed!
Get in the boat!
- Eddie, what are you doing?
- Get in!
Eddie, what are you doing?
The best I can.
Get the boat!
He's on the ice!
- Are you OK?
- Yes!
He's out of our sight. 12 o'clock.
Lily, the bag! Give me the bag.
Go, go!
There's nobody in there!
We need a pollution revolution.
I don't care.
Search all of Wisconsin if you have to.
They lost him?
We've been to C-Systems.
We can't get any information.
It used to be a government-run facility.
Now county records say it doesn't even exist.
Maybe you weren't really there.
Maybe we're not really here.
Eddie, I can't... feel my legs.
Come on.
Come on.
We've got fire, we've got fire.
Why would a policeman shoot another policeman?
Maybe they weren't police.
Why didn't they shoot at us?
I don't know.
What a dump, huh?
- Mr Shannon.
- What?
Two FBI agents want to see you.
This is more important than his afternoon tea.
My apologies for interrupting your tea, Mr Shannon.
- What's Kasalivich doing in Wisconsin?
- Running away from you.
We understand he phoned you.
I counselled Eddie to turn himself in to the authorities.
He and Miss Sinclair shot a Wisconsin state trooper.
I doubt that very seriously.
Well... the state trooper's very dead.
Mr Shannon, these are copies of the Moore Foundation IRS files.
Do you know what's in them?
Meagre tax records, I imagine.
We are a non-profit organisation.
The funding for your foundation comes from a wide variety of sources.
Defence contractors, telecommunication companies, aerospace.
It's gratifying to know our work is appreciated.
The bulk of funding seems to come from one Cayman Islands account.
I don't do the fundraising.
Oh, yeah. And the account is classified.
Who pays your salary, Mr Shannon?
The foundation pays my salary.
Classified accounts, encrypted phone calls...
A man could be forgiven for thinking that your foundation is a front for the CIA.
In that case, there may be national security issues here that are larger than us all.
Obstructing an FBI investigation is a federal crime.
- I know the law, Mr...
- Doyle.
National security does not include murdering people.
Domestically, at least.
Tell your friends at Langley that domestic is our back yard.
They're not allowed to play here.
You can keep the returns.
Nice house.
And for dinner tonight, we have a choice of sardines...
...or sardines.
Gosh, I think I'll have... sardines.
Sardines. Beautiful choice.
So, is this how you seduce all the girls?
Only physicists with hypothermia who are accused of being a terrorist.
Thank you.
There's a garage.
I'm going to see what's in there.
I won't be long, OK?
Your pit bull has killed a Wisconsin state trooper.
Well, now.
Would you rather the Bureau got the girl and Kasalivich?
First, he was a suspect.
Worst case scenario... they arrest him.
Now he's a cop-killer.
Worst case scenario, they kill him.
For God's sake, what possessed you to frame him in the first place?
Two words.
Convenience... and expedience.
He saw too much, he was talking.
The poor boy was in the wrong place at the wrong time.
I need this poor boy!
This poor boy is the only one who knows the frequencies!
Do you understand the concept, Lyman?
Poor impulse control?
Barkley, Chen, the regulator.
That was supposed to be it!
That was all of it!
I am sick to death of cleaning up your messes.
No, Paul, no. Yours.
Not mine.
You lost it, Paul.
Lost control, perspective.
You made it personal with these people.
Well, we'll find them.
We'll find them, and when we do and we've got this thing working, then, my friend, then this young man will be a liability.
That'll be my problem.
- Our problem.
- No, Lyman.
When the time comes,
I'll handle it.
You'd better.
So what does he want us to do?
We find him and give him an injection.
Lily.
Lily!
Come on.
Leesburg, Virginia.
C-Systems.
Who are they?
Not cops.
Cops carry badges, credit cards, pictures of their families.
If it's crowded, don't go in.
OK.
- Hi!
- Hello.
Can I help you?
I'd like to send some flowers and a note to a friend in Virginia.
It's a little strange, Mr Shannon, but these just arrived.
I'm not quite sure where they're from.
Here's a note.
May I see that?
Thank you.
Hold it right there, buddy.
FBI.
Step outside the van, please.
Why don't you bring your invoice sheet out with you?
Do you know if the order originated at this shop?
I don't think so.
I think it was a wire from Georgetown.
- Mind if I take one of these?
- No, sure.
Have a nice day.
So officially this investigation is now code-named Steel Bomb.
We'll input the data into Rapid Start.
Look what I brought back from the flower shop.
I think this is Kasalivich.
Spawn versus Neanderthal man, 4pm today.
What is this, a wrestling match?
Bad movie, video game?
Spawn, it's a comic-book character.
- The guy who comes back from the dead?
- Yeah, like Kasalivich.
Maybe Shannon is the Neanderthal man?
Very well may be.
Hello, Eddie.
Glad you got the flowers.
Very clever.
Are you all right?
No, not really.
I guess I can understand that.
We were at Maggie's.
Caught. We were about to be arrested.
Somebody shot the cop.
Later, two guys tried to kill us.
I've got my car outside. Follow me.
We'll go someplace we can talk.
I found this... in one of the guy's wallets.
They weren't cops.
What do you know about C-Systems, Paul?
This is not the time or the place, Eddie.
We're being watched.
Eddie, the world isn't as simple as we'd like it to be.
It just doesn't work that way.
Shannon, who are you?
I'm your friend, Eddie.
I may be your only friend.
Is it you, Paul?
Are you responsible for all this?
Time to go, Eddie.
You've got ajob to complete.
The experiment needs verifying.
Do your work... This will all be over.
Eddie, we're beyond that now.
Let's just get this done.
Come back to work with me.
You'll have your life back, I promise you.
You don't control our lives.
You'll have to trust me, Eddie.
Just like Alistair?
Eddie!
Eddie!
A trip that normally takes over five hours.
But today, you'll experience the events of that flight in just seven minutes.
The crew is preparing for takeoff.
Your pilot for today's flight is Captain Dave Larsen.
Stay here.
Our co-pilot is First Officer...
Get in.
She's in the hatch.
Look out!
The crew are going through their final pre-flight checks...
Eddie!
Eddie!
Come on, don't do anything foolish.
Get Ford. DC police reported a disturbance at the Science Museum by the Neanderthal man exhibit.
CQ 493... CQ 493.
Here you are, darling. Drink this.
You're dehydrated.
Wash it out of your system.
Mr Collier and I have a few colleagues we'd like you to meet.
Dr Holloway, Dr Hamada, and Dr Orbit.
They are very interested to discuss your work with you.
And, of course, Dr Lu Chen.
Lu.
Lily.
We would like you and Dr Chen to continue the work you were doing with Dr Barkley.
- You can't be serious!
- Oh, yes.
We've been impressed with your work for a long time.
Do you drug and kidnap everyone whose work you admire?
No.
Dr Barkley, we left behind.
Slay the dreamer, eh, Mr Shannon?
You end up sleeping on the street.
I can't believe you'd do that.
Can you spare some change?
A quarter, what's a quarter?
Can't you see me?
Can I share your grate?
You make me sick!
We can't go in! We got kicked out!
What are all youse looking at?
Let go!
CQ 493.
This is Eddie. I think. He does.
But he really does.
What are you watching?
"Honeymooner" reruns?
Kasalivich and Barkley. Look at this.
Does he look like he's about to kill this guy and blow the place up?
The whole thing stinks.
We've got the ballistics report back on that trooper killed in Wisconsin.
Teflon sniper round went through the cop's Kevlar vest.
I don't buy it.
He's smart enough to blow up the lab but stupid enough to leave $250,000 where we'd find it?
Are you saying some cowboy's gone off the reservation?
$100. The kid didn't do it.
You've got a nationwide manhunt for an innocent man.
Make sure nobody shoots him.
Next shift's going down now, OK?
Yeah, right.
Help me out on this, will you?
I've had problems with the conveyor belt.
No, I'll have Jim Zinsky work on that.
OK? All right.
If you've got any problems, call me on channel four.
How is our young charge?
Did she say anything?
We'll soon find out, won't we?
The young lady does appear to be cooperating.
Good.
- Gentlemen, you're just in time.
- Let's get on with it.
Miss Sinclair, Mr Chen, please, have a seat.
Attention, all personnel.
Critical path experiment will commence in ten minutes.
Critical path experiment will commence in ten minutes.
Level five.
Activate the H2 compressor.
On... on automatic.
Here we go.
Lucasz, what are you reading?
- Two million kelvin.
- Activate the laser.
Four million kelvin.
You don't have it. It's unstable.
Shut it down! Shut it down!
Dammit! What ajoke.
It won't work without the right frequencies.
What did he say?
He said that's what he's been trying to tell you for days.
Look. Let's try it again in the morning, OK?
- See you back here at 8.15 tomorrow?
- I have a feeling, Dr Sinclair, the solution will present itself.
I doubt it.
It had better or your usefulness will soon be outlived.
Take them back to their room.
I wish you wouldn't threaten to kill my scientists to their faces.
It might make my job easier.
Lucasz, Hamada, seal the lab!
I want to see those printouts first thing in the morning.
- It's working?
- Yes.
- How?
- Lucasz claims he figured it out.
Lucasz?
That's his story.
When I got here, the output was going right through the roof!
Son of a bitch!
It really does work. Ha!
Dr Shannon, take a look at that.
We've got it.
What did you do?
Nothing.
I couldn't sleep last night, sir.
I heard this voice saying, go and check different frequencies because we were trying on 15 and 20 megahertz.
So I went down to the lab and ran the experiment and it all worked out.
So... here we are, sir.
Did you document the regulator frequencies?
Not yet.
I'd like those on a disk... Now, sir.
None too shabby, hey, Mr Shannon?
- Doctor.
- Thank you.
Where are you going, Paul?
I'm going to check this against the Chicago data.
I'll try to meet you at the silo.
- Wait as long as you can.
- Yes, sir.
Hello, Eddie!
I figured it was you.
Nice place you have here, Shannon.
Ten-megajoule lasers.
Particle reactors.
Congress de-funded most of the stuff here years ago.
They made a mistake.
Is this part of the Moore Foundation?
In a manner of speaking.
Power and money.
Is that what this was all about?
I'm afraid it's more complicated than that.
He was a 60-year-old scientist who did nothing but good and they put a bag over his head.
It was a mistake.
I didn't want anything to happen to Alistair.
But a decision had to be made.
So...
Who made the decision?
- You?
- That's my job.
That's what I'm paid to do.
I'm paid to do dirty work.
Work people don't want to know about.
People want to live in split-level homes.
They want microwave dinners and colour TV.
Is that what you think?
Alistair was a dreamer.
Clean air, free energy.
Noble concepts but we live on a planet that is addicted to petroleum.
What happens if you dump free energy onto the market?
World stock markets would plummet.
Our own economy would collapse.
Recession, unemployment, war.
The world is speeding up too fast now, Eddie.
We can barely hold on as it is.
You're right, it's not working.
So we've got to try something else.
Not bury the technology, but let it out.
You let it out, but you let it out at a pace the world can absorb.
It can absorb it now.
There's our boy.
Mr Kasalivich!
How kind of you to join us.
Give us a moment, Lyman.
Eddie and I are having a conversation.
Please! Don't let me stop you!
Who runs this place, Shannon? You?
- Or the guy with the guns?
- Well, we are a cooperative of sorts.
Run at the behest of the United States government.
But without their knowledge, right?
My, my, but your friend is sharp, Paul.
All right, Eddie.
What do you want?
There are the specs for the regulator.
You can pull the frequencies off the computer.
Now let us go.
I get it to work. You give us our lives back.
That was the deal, wasn't it?
Yeah.
Yeah, that was the deal.
I'm afraid, young man, your position is non-negotiable.
I see.
I want to tell you this story how I got inspired.
- I had this dream...
- No!
Hold on.
I will continue.
What's happening?
What did you just do?
I just told the FBI I was willing to surrender.
Oh, and er... I think your experiment just got a mind of its own.
Check the breakers.
Everybody, back to your stations!
What the hell's going on, Doyle?
It started a few minutes ago... hundreds of pages.
Technical drawings, experiment specs, budgets, personnel records, minutes, mostly marked top secret.
- Where's it coming from?
- C-Systems.
It's like they dumped their mainframe into our computers.
Here's a special love note just for you.
Jesus Christ, Kasalivich.
He's in a bunker in Leesburg with his bomb-making buddies and wants us to arrest him.
- Lake Geneva Radical Bomb Network?
- Sound like bullshit?
It sounds like you owe me $100.
Make sure that fax doesn't run out of paper.
- Hamada!
- Still off-line!
- Pressure?
- 500 psi and rising.
What the hell's going on?
We've lost control of the system, Lyman.
We can't shut it down.
Turn it off.
It's self-sustaining. It can't be shut down.
Al! How long before we run out of storage capacity?
I don't know. It's accelerating.
- 20 minutes before it blows?
- Maybe less.
- Is he right?
- I'm afraid he is.
Well done, Eddie.
Well done.
You wouldn't blow it up if you weren't sure you'd get out alive.
Sure I would.
Lyman, I think it's time we got the hell out of here.
- No!
- Chen!
- Lily!
- Chen!
For God's sake, Lyman!
Chen! Chen!
Wait!
- Jesus Christ!
- What is wrong with you?
- Turn it off!
- That was totally unnecessary.
If you haven't got the stomach for this, stay out of the way.
I'm going to turn down the power.
- No!
- Don't touch that!
Don't!
Hydrogen containment failure.
Potential personnel hazard.
- The compressor's just shut down.
- Turn it back on!
- You can't.
- The computers are down.
Get out!
Get out! Everybody!
- Fix it.
- I can't now.
- Fix it!
- I can't!
I wouldn't do that, Lyman.
It will ignite the hydrogen.
It's over, Lyman. It's over.
I guess it's time to go.
Go! Go!
Give me the disk.
You two, stay!
No, Lyman! Let them go!
What possible difference can it make now?
- They stay!
- When does it end, Lyman?
Never.
Well, it's not your decision.
The decision is mine, and I say they're coming.
You can stay with them... if you like.
We must go now.
Well, are you coming?
Warning. Warning.
Air contaminants at critical level.
Come on, Paul! We've got things to do!
I'm sorry, Eddie.
- Shannon!
- Shannon!
Please!
Warning! Air contaminants at critical level.
Evacuate immediately.
Warning. Air contaminants at critical level.
Evacuate immediately.
All containment doors are now closed.
The tanks.
OK, here's the elevator.
There's room for everybody.
I'm looking for two men.
Paul Shannon and Lyman Collier.
Hang onto them.
Follow the blue evacuation route arrows to the elevators.
Move in an orderly fashion quickly and quietly...
Our friends from the FBI will be here presently.
Anita, we're on our way.
You two go to the north elevator.
I'll take it from here.
Come on! Come on, Lily.
Eddie, which way?
By the way, Paul, do you have that disk?
The one with the magic frequency?
Thank you so much.
You know, Paul, maybe it's time to call it a day.
Maybe you're getting too old for this.
What do you think, huh?
But then again what would we do?
What would we do?
I didn't tell you, Lyman, but your retirement had already been arranged.
Containment systems off.
Access restored to all areas.
Containment systems off.
Hey, hold on, hold on!
Take it up, take it up!
They got a 20 on Kasalivich?
They found the stolen truck at the construction site nearby.
Hold on.
Eddie, look.
Get up. Come on, Reed. We've gotta go!
I thought you said the hole was clear!
Get back in the seat, Ernie.
Eddie.
Lily, get in the basket!
Get out of here. Go!
Eddie, come on!
Eddie!
Hold on, hold on, Eddie.
Come on, Eddie.
Aagh!
Come on, Eddie. Come on!
Pull it up, pull it up.
Holy... did you see that?
Whoa!
Come on, get him out of there.
Eddie Kasalivich.
Agent Ford. You got the message.
Yeah, we levelled a forest printing it.
What's it mean, Eddie?
- Plans for clean, cheap energy.
- Anybody else get this?
Hopefully, a few thousand top scientists.
- I knew I liked this kid.
- Yeah, right, Leon.
Come on.
You've got some questions to answer in Washington for about six weeks.
- That's OK.
- We've got a lot to talk about as long as everyone stops shooting at us.
Doyle, spilt 'em up.
I'll meet you at the office.
Ford!
Doctor Sinclair and I ride together.
All right, come on, both of you.
Anita, take a memo.
To the Director of Central Intelligence.
C-Systems... no longer a viable entity.
Will be in contact.
That's it.
Remember when they let commercial airlines land in this town?
I don't understand where we're going...
...or why we're bothering anyhow.
-You're doing a good deed.
-Give us a better reason.
A maniac hijacked a municipal bus with 30 passengers on it.
I got a hunch where those passengers are and who that maniac is.
Share it with us.
Phoenix.
Simon Phoenix.
Send a maniac to catch one.
Phoenix!
Don't move, Phoenix.
You're under arrest.
Arrest? Shit.
And you're trespassing.
Where are the passengers?
Oh, yes, the passengers.
Well, they're....
Fuck you.
The passengers are gone.
See, I told the city,
"Look, nobody comes down here."
Postmen figured it out...
...policemen figured it out.
But the goddamn bus drivers just wouldn't listen.
Last time, Phoenix.
Where are the hostages?
To hell with the hostages!.
This is between you and me!.
What you got?
Do something.
Go ahead.
You're up to your ass in gasoline.
I'll set your ass on fire.
Is it cold in here...
...or is it just me?
Where are they, Phoenix?
Now, where did I put them?
I swear, I'd lose my head if it wasn't attached.
I'll keep that in mind.
Damn it, I'm tired of this "demolition-man" shit!
You were not supposed to come down here!
You were not supposed to attempt the arrest of Phoenix alone...
...or to blow anything up!
It wasn't me! He dumped the gas and rigged the place to blow!
Right, you weren't involved.
I know you've tried to nail this psycho for years.
But remember a thing called...
...official police procedure?
-Where are the hostages?
-They're not here.
What?
He must've stashed them someplace else!
Are you sure they weren't in there?
I did a thermo check and there were eight of them, all part of his gang.
Wrong again!
You got something to say?
Get him out of here!
Motherfucker!
We are going to have a chat.
Captain!
Over here! There're bodies everywhere!
There must be 20 or 30.
They're everywhere.
See that? I told him!
He said he didn't care!
How could you sacrifice all those innocent people for me!
What kind of man are you?
We'll spend a lot of quality time together.
'Bye, sweetie!
Honey! Sugar!
If you got a lawyer, better call him.
John Spartan, you've done great deeds for Los Angeles.
So, it is with some regret that l,
William Smithers...
...acting as Assistant Warden, hereby carry out this sentence.
Skip it.
You've been sentenced to 70 years...
...sub-zero re-habilitation in the California Cryo-Penitentiary...
...for the involuntary manslaughter of 30 civilians.
Skip it.
You'll be placed in cryo-stasis for the duration of your sentence...
...and your behavior will be altered through synaptic suggestion.
You'll be eligible for parole no earlier than the year 2046.
I'm sorry.
All personnel...
...the next scheduled parole hearing for prisoner Gilmour...
...will take place at 07:. 15.
Warden William Smithers report to Level A, conference room.
Mellow greetings.
Be well, Lieutenant Lenina Huxley.
As it is a beautiful...
...Monday morning and as my duty log irrationally requires it...
...I'm querying you on the prison population.
Does the tedium continue?
Your question is amusing but irrelevant.
The prisoners are ice cubes.
They never move.
I find this lack of stimulus to be truly disappointing.
-Don't you think?
-I try not to.
You're young, think all you want.
Things don't happen anymore, we've taken care of all that.
I'll fiber-op you back after the parole hearings.
Have a peachy day.
Be well.
Be well.
Vector 137.
Upcoming, Santa Monica Boulevard.
Retina coding accepted.
Warden Smithers, be well.
Go on.
Self-drive on.
Self-drive engaged.
Coding on.
No police presence is requested in the city at this time.
Report to the station.
Oh, boy, how exciting.
That's it.
"Food, glorious food. "
There'll be another in 12 hours.
These assholes are predictable.
God, I hate this place!
There's not enough of us, Friendly.
That doesn't really matter anymore.
People are hungry.
We've nothing to lose.
Greetings.
Lovely Lenina.
Greetings, welcome to the emergency line of the SAPD.
If you prefer an automated response, press one now.
Be well.
Mellow greetings, Lenina Huxley.
Let me guess, all is serene?
On the contrary, it's been a horrific a.m.
Public buildings were defaced.
Walls smudged with...
...scandalous graffiti.
Really?
Brutal. Why wasn't there an "all-cars notify"?
Because there was no need to create widespread panic.
Lieutenant Huxley...
...I monitored your disheartening and distressing comments...
...to the warden this morning.
Do you really long for chaos and disharmony?
Your fascination with the 20th century is affecting your judgment.
You realize you're setting a bad example for other officers and personnel.
Thank you for the attitude readjustment.
Info assimilated.
Sanctimonious asshole.
Lenina Huxley, you are fined 1/2 credit...
...for a 'sotto voce' violation of the verbal-morality statute.
Thank you.
That was tense.
That was tense?
Don't you get bored code tracing perps who break curfew and tell dirty jokes?
I find my job deeply fulfilling.
I just can't get over the reality of this office, Lenina.
You're still addicted to the 20th century.
High from its harshness.
Buzzed by its brutality.
Holy smokes!
Is there anything in this office which doesn't violate Contraband Ordinance 22?
Only you.
Don't you ever want something to happen?
Goodness, no.
I knew you'd say that.
What I wouldn't give for some action.
Mr. Simon Phoenix.
One of our first and most illustrious members.
Allow me...

Let's get this over quickly.
Twenty-nine years ago, the parole system, as you know it...

Stop it!
Do you have anything fresh to say on your behalf?
I thought not.
Yeah.
I do.

"Gun, " noun. Portable firearm.
This device was widely utilized in the urban wars of the late 20th century.
Referred to as a "pistol. "
I don't need a history lesson.
Where are the goddamn guns?
You are fined one credit for a violation of the verbal-morality statute.

The problem is not the defacement of public buildings or...
...the noise pollution caused by the exploding devices.
Allow me to explain.
The real problem lies in the man whose initials...
...mark the detonating graffiti...
...on the streets of our peaceful city.
The man behind the "E.F."...
...Mr. Edgar Friendly.
For a sadly extended period of time...
...we in San Angeles...
...have been plagued by a pack of subterranean hooligans.
You will come to know them as "scraps."
Men and women who have left the comfort of our society...
...only to spew hostility...
...at the very bosom they have relinquished.
There was a time when we used to look upon these scraps...
...as rather pathetic and relatively harmless.
Now they have a leader.
Mr. Friendly seems relentless in his ambition...
...to infect our harmony with his venom.
He must, of course...
...be stopped.
This radical terrorist behavior, led by Mr. Friendly...
...must not be allowed to undermine our safety.
"Safety Above All."
I expect your trust, confidence and certitude.
Excuse me.

It was just....
It was so....
How can a man be so blatantly sadistic?
It was fun for him.
Do everything in your power to snare this agent of destruction.
You have my utmost confidence.
It will be done, Dr. Cocteau.
Be well.
"Utmost confidence."
"Everything in our power."
What else is there?
Zachary Lamb...
...how was the fiendish Phoenix apprehended back in the 20th?
Twelve-state manhunt.
Satellite surveillance.
A video bite on Unsolved Mysteries.
None of them worked.
In the end, it took just one man.
One cop.
John Spartan.
John Spartan?
That's right.
They called him the "Demolition Man."
Spartan file 98345, LAPD.
Spartan file 98761C, LAPD.
Are you sure this is real life?
Barely.
Spartan's a legend.
I've been doing a historical study.
Over 1,000 arrests over three years.
All authentic criminals.
There was a lot more business back then.
How can you justify destroying a $7 million mini mall...
...to rescue a girl whose ransom is only $25,000?
Fuck you, lady.
Good answer.
This is your recommendation?
The Demolition Man's an animal.
He's clearly the man for a job such as this.
You could reinstate him.
He's a muscle-bound grotesque...
...who hasn't worn a shield in 40 years.
Simon Phoenix is an old-fashioned criminal.
We need an old-fashioned cop.

I am unconvinced.
It's within the powers of the police charter.
He can be released on limited parole and reinstated to active duty.
It's not enough to collect the '90s?
Cocteau said everything in our power.
I can't think of a better idea.
That doesn't mean it's a good one.
This man comes from a dissimilar method of law enforcement.
I'm not sure he's any different than Simon Phoenix himself.
Detective?
I am Lieutenant Lenina Huxley.
The year is 2032.
The reason you have been released is--
How long have I been under?
Thirty-six years.
I had a wife.
What happened to my wife?
Her light was extinguished in the Big One of 2010.
She died.
In an earthquake.
The earthquake.
I had a daughter.
What happened to her?
John Spartan.
I am Chief of Police George Earle.
We didn't thaw you out for a family reunion.
Consider it fortunate that the lieutenant did a probe on your wife.
This is about you and the cryo-con Simon Phoenix.
What?
Today Simon Phoenix escaped from this cryo-facility. We've had 1 1 murders...
...so far.
You see, we've become a society of peace-loving...
...and understanding and we are, quite frankly, not equipped...
...to deal with this situation.
There's been no deaths of unnatural causes in San Angeles for 1 6 years.
Where?
The Santa Barbara, Los Angeles,
San Diego Metroplex merged in 201 1.
You are in what used to be LA.
That's great.
-You, get me a Marlboro.
-Yes, of course.
What's a Marlboro?
It's a cigarette. Any cigarette.
Smoking is not good for you.
Anything not good for you is bad.
Hence, illegal. Alcohol, caffeine, contact sports, meat--
Are you shitting me?
You are fined one credit for violation of the verbal-morality statute.
What the hell is that?
- You are fined one credit....
-Bad language...
...chocolate, gasoline, uneducational toys and spicy food.
Abortion is illegal, so is pregnancy if you don't have a license.
Caveman...
...Iet's finish with the Rip Van Winkle and get moving.
Our Mr. Phoenix has risen from the ashes.
I tracked that dirtbag for two years...
...and when I finally bring him down you turn me into an ice cube.
Thanks, but no thanks.
The conditions of your parole are full reinstatement into the SAPD...
...and immediate assignment to the apprehension of Phoenix.
Or...
...you can go back into cryo-stasis.
Not many people get a second chance,
John Spartan.
Any new inforama on Simon Phoenix?
There is nothing, Lenina Huxley.
Where's Spartan?
He went to the bathroom.
I guess he got all thawed out.
I formally convey my presence.
How are you doing?
We're not used to physical-contact greetings.
I don't know...
...if you guys know it but...
...you're out of toilet paper.
Did you say "toilet paper"?
They used handfuls of wadded paper...
...back in the 20th.
I'm happy you're happy, but in place of toilet paper...
...you've got a shelf with three seashells.
He doesn't know how to use the seashells.
I can see how that'd be confusing.
I don't believe it. Is that you, Spartan?
Zach Lamb?
What happened to you?
I got older.
My God, I remember when you were...
...a rookie pilot.
They finally grounded me.
Shit, you were a damn good flyer.
You're fined two credits for violation of the verbal-morality statute.
I'll be right back.
They seem to be friends, yet...
...he speaks to him in the most profane manner.
If you'd read my study, you'd know this is how heterosexual men bonded.
I knew that.
Thanks a lot you shit-brained, fuck-faced, ball-breaking, duck-fucking...
-...pain in the ass.
- You're fined five credits...
...for repeated violations of the verbal-morality statute.
So much for the seashells.
See you in a few minutes.
Voice check, Lenina Huxley.
Unfortunately Simon Phoenix was not coded.
While you were sleeping a code was installed on everyone.
It was a brilliant idea by Dr. Cocteau.
An organic microchip...
...is sewn into the skin.
Sensors all over the city can zero in on anyone at any time.
I can't even conceive of what police officers did before it was developed.
We worked. This fascist crap makes me want to puke.
What do you think you're scratching?
You really think we'd let you go without control?
Your code was implanted when you were thawed.
Why not just shove a leash up my ass?
You dirty meat-eater!
No matter how Viking your era was...
...I cannot digest how you ever wore a badge!
You're going back, John Spartan, you're going back!
Could you two please dump some hormones?
We need every cortex we can get here.
We don't need the Neanderthal.
Our computer has already examined every scenario...
...resulting from the appearance of Simon Phoenix.
It's determined he'll try to set up a drug lab and form a crime syndicate.
That is correct.
I hate to interrupt you two...
...but that's fucking stupid.
You think he wants to start a business?
Phoenix is going for a gun.
Plain and simple.
Trust me.
He's going for a gun.
Who cares what this primate thinks?
Resonate some understanding.
The only place a person can even view a gun in this city...
...is at a museum.
Welcome to the San Angeles Museum of History.
Beneath you is an excavation...
...of an actual 20th-century street scene...
...in downtown Los Angeles, preserved since the earthquake of 2010.
For specific information on objects featured in the exhibit....
Firearms are displayed in the Armory...
...Iocated on Level A.
You are entering the Hall of Violence...
...a visual representation of the primitive behavior prevalent...
...during the late 20th century.
Home, sweet home.
John Spartan, even if Simon Phoenix was able to locate the cache of firearms...
...it'd be impossible to remove them.
She's right. They're located in a maximum-security armory exhibit.
It's just a hunch. Trust me on this.
It's a cop thing.
And what am l, a frog?
Excuse me.
I'll drive.
Resetting all bio-links for new driver.
Weight, height, peripheral vision set.
If you would like...
...to commence transportation,
John Spartan, initialize sequence now.
You drive.
Welcome, Lenina Huxley.
You seem very much alone,
John Spartan, but...
...things aren't all that different.
Perhaps you'd like to hear an oldies station?
"Oh, what a relief it is. "
This is the town's most popular station.
Wall-to-wall mini-tunes.
You called them "commercials."
The classic you've been waiting for.
The number one request:
"Armour Hot Dogs. "
"Kids eat Armour Hot Dogs.... "
This is my fave!
"Skinny kids, kids who climb on rocks
"Tall kids, sissy kids, even kids with...
"...chicken pox love hot dogs
"Armour Hot Dogs
"The dogs kids love to bite. "
Someone put me back in the fridge.
You are entering the armory exhibit.
Here you will find displays in the cabinets and walls....
So sorry. Didn't see you there.
Sweet baby.
Oh, shit.
This is what I'm talking about.
How do I get in here?
Is there a 15-day waiting period?
Or can I just take one now?
Motherfucker.
Oh, fuck it.
Mellow greetings.
What seems to be your boggle?
My "boggle"?
How much do you weigh?
I weigh--
Please vacate the museum, patrons.
Be calm.
Please vacate...
...the museum, patrons. Be calm.
Wait a minute, this is the future.
Where are all the phaser guns?
Mellow greetings, sir.
What's your boggle?
Warning, please exit rapidly.
The magnetic accelerator gun, the last hand-held weapon...
...of this millennium, displaced the flow of neutrons...
...through a nonlinear cycloid electromagnetic accumulator.
So, what? It needs batteries?
What size? Where the fuck do you find batteries?
Is there a battery store around here?
Excuse me, patron. Can l--
Where's Radio Shack?
Sweet music to my ears.
Activated, the magnetic accelerator gun will achieve fusion in 2.6 minutes.
I was thinking about leaving quickly.
Patience is not one of my virtues.
Did you see that?
What?
Never mind. I give up trying to figure this place out.
Excuse me, Rambo. I need to borrow this.
Access and correlate procedure.

-Luke Skywalker, use the Force.
-Oh, dear.
-What the hell is this?
-It's a glow-rod. It's what we got.
Does it work?
Guess so.
He's trapped in Section 8.
I doubt it. Make sure the building's clear.
Done. I want a visual.
Every corridor of the museum,
I want full sensors routed to me.
You guys wait here. Give me 1 0 minutes.
Museum patron, you are now confined to the armory.
Museum patron, you are now confined to the Armory.
The armory exhibit is now sealed.
All museum patrons still in the facility should remain calm.
Help is imminent.
This museum is no longer sealed.
What can I say? I'm a blast from the past.
You should've stayed there.
That voice sounds familiar. Who is that?
Bad aim, Blondie.
John Spartan?
They let anybody into this century!
What're you doing here?
Simon says:. bleed!
Great. Just great.
You're making it too easy.
Come on, you piece of shit!
Let me get this right.
They defrosted you just so you could lasso my piddly ass?
I've dreamed about killing you for 40 years.
Keep dreaming!
Magnetic accelerator activated.
About time.
Past is over!
Time for something new and improved!
Oh, hell.
Shit! I love this gun!
How do you like the future?
Come on!
That must hurt!
Huh, Soldier Boy?
You're on TV!
Shit!
You're dead!
Forgot to say:. "Simon says."
Oh, shit.
Good one.
Sorry, you must go!
Shit!
Our noble facility has been desecrated by hooligans.
Someone will pay dearly for this.
Sir, the stress breeder is inside being demobilized as we speak.
Shit. Being frozen must've thrown my aim off.
I'll get you with the next shot.
I don't think so.
No kiss-kiss, no bang-bang.
You were doing so well.
Don't you have a job to do?
Isn't there a thought repeating in your barbaric brain?
The name Friendly.
Mr. Edgar Friendly.
Don't you have someone to kill?
-Yeah, I do.
-Excellent.
Then go and do your job.
Shit.
Saved by the bell.
Shit!
Damn!
You're lucky he didn't whack you.
I must say that "whacking," whatever it is, sounds most disagreeable.
You scared him away.
I don't know how to thank you.
You saved my life.
No problem.
Not bad for a 74-year-old.
Simon Phoenix knows he has some competition.
He's finally matched his meat.
You really licked his ass.
That's "met his match"...
...and "kicked his ass."
"Met his match and kicked his ass."
Captain Earle....
Who is this man?
John Spartan, temporarily reinstated to the San Angeles Police Department...
...to pursue the escaped cryo-con
Simon Phoenix.
You told us to do everything in our power to capture him.
Yes, I did. I did.
Yes, I do recall the exploits of Mr. John Spartan.
Yes, of course. The Demolition Man.
That's quite all right.
Unexpected. Creative.
But quite all right.
John Spartan, welcome.
In honor of your arrival and your...
...protection of the sanctity of human life...
...namely my own...
...I'd like to invite you to join me for dinner tonight.
Both of you.
Please, I insist.
I would like you to accompany me...
...to Pizza Hut.
Look forward to it. Thanks.
"Pizza Hut?"
So let me get this right:
Spacely Sprockets here, who's now the man in charge, the Mayor-Gov...
...who wants to take me to Pizza Hut...
...and I wouldn't mind a pizza...
...has also built the damn cryo-prison?
John Spartan, you are fined....
Dr. Cocteau is the most important man in town.
He practically created our whole way of life...
...savage.
He can have it.
Phoenix could be anywhere...
...but not being coded can limit him.
Correct. Money is outmoded.
All transactions are through codes.
So he can't buy food or a place to stay for the night.
It'd be a waste of time to mug someone.
Unless he rips off someone's hand.
But with officers patrolling...
...it should be just a matter of tick-tocks before--
We already have a backup plan.
We can wait for another code to go red.
When Phoenix performs another MurderDeathKill...
...we'll know exactly where to pounce.
Great plan.
Thank you.
I've been an enthusiast of your escapades for quite some time.
In fact, I perused some visuals from the Schwarzenegger Library.
Hold it.
"The Schwarzenegger Library?"
Yes, the Schwarzenegger
Presidential Library.
Wasn't he an actor?
He was President?
Even though he wasn't a native, his popularity caused the 61st Amendment.
I don't want to know.
President?
What's this? No welcome mat?
What is this?
How do they expect you to kill somebody?
Shit, I love that smell.
Reminds me of biscuits and gravy.
All right. A job is a job.
Edgar Friendly, whoever the fuck you are, prepare for Simon Phoenix.
What's with Cocteau?
He says I saved his life, though I'm not sure of it.
My reward is dinner and dancing at Pizza Hut?
I like a big, fat piece of pizza, but....
Your tone is quasi-facetious.
Pizza Hut is the only restaurant to survive the Franchise Wars.
So?
Now all restaurants are Pizza Hut.
No way.
Welcome to Pizza Hut.
Enjoy your meal.
"Valley of the Jolly Green Giant
"Good things from the garden
"Garden in the valley
"Valley of the Jolly Green Giant"
Here comes the Neanderthal.
Mr. Spartan over there please, and Lieutenant....
Thank you.
How are you doing?
Enjoy-joy your meal, sir.
Good thing I'm hungry.
Ladies and gentlemen, please raise your glasses to the hero of the hour...
...my savior...
...Detective John Spartan.
Appreciate it.
Greetings and salutations.
I'm Associate Bob.
We met before, ever so briefly.
I was in fear at the time.
Do you have the salt?
Salt is not good for you, hence, it is illegal.
So, John Spartan, tell me...
...what do you think of San Angeles, 2032?
I thought the future would be a rotting cesspool.
You weren't here when the real disturbances began.
Civilization tried to destroy itself.
The city degenerated into a total fear zone.
People stayed home, afraid to go out.
People wanted the madness over.
When I saw the chance to make things right...
...I seized it.
If I had not, the radiance of San Angeles would not be here.
Just your rotting cesspool of hate and suffering. Which would you prefer?
Can you book me a flight out of here when the sermon's over?
John Spartan...
...for your crimes you would surely have died...
...in jail before now.
Even you must appreciate the persuasively tranquil humanity...
...of the cryo-prison system?
I don't want to spoil your dinner, but my cryo-sentence was no sweet lullaby.
I had feelings and thoughts.
How about a 36-year nightmare about people caught in a burning building?
You were awake? I don't think so.
I think so.
My wife beating her fists against a block of ice that was her husband.
Then you woke me up and told me everything that meant something is gone.
It would have been more humane to leave me to the fucking crows.
What would you say if I called you a brutish fossil...
...symbolic of the decayed era gratefully forgotten?
I don't know. "Thanks?"
I thought during rehabilitation...
...the prisoners were not conscious.
A person would go insane.
The side-effects of the cryo-process...
...are unavoidable.
You were found guilty of a crime.
You owed and still owe a debt to society.
There's nothing I can do.
Yes, call for backup.
I'll be across the street.
Where are you going?
Bad guys about to do bad things.
It's just one of those hunches.
Go for the truck!
The food's in the truck!
Grab the big box! Move!
You'll regret this the rest of your life.
Both seconds of it.
Good night!
Get him!
What a fucking hero. Come on.
Please, don't.
What the hell?
Such reckless abandonment.
Looks like there is a new shepherd in town.
That's "sheriff." Who are those guys?
They're known as "scraps."
Outcasts and deserters who choose to live beneath us...
...in sewers and abandoned tunnels.
They're a constant irritation to our harmony.
They're nothing but thugs.
A society of thieves. The last remaining criminal element in the city.
But plans are in progress to purge this peril from our day.
You're better live than on laser disk.
The way you paused to make a witticism before doing battle...
...with that Scrap--
This isn't the Wild West, okay?
The Wild West wasn't even the Wild West.
Hurting people isn't good.
Sometimes it is, but not...
...when it's people looking for food.
San Angeles time is now 22:15.
Coding off.
Auto-drive.
Auto-drive engaged.
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
No need for a de-hurtful retraction.
I assimilated too much contraband.
I fleshed you out as a blow-up-the-bad- guy-while-grinning type.
But you're the moody-gunslinger-who- will-only-draw-when-he-must type.
Stop.
What?
I just do my job and things get--
Demolished.
I think of my daughter growing up in a place like this.
I'm afraid she'll think I'm a primitive.
As much as I want to see her,
I almost don't want to.
Because I don't think I'll fit in well.
Not at all.
It'd be a minor misuse of police powers, but I could do a search for you.
Sorry.
Subject change. I got what you wanted.
Great.
What's that for?
It's just one of those cop hunches.
Lights.
I've changed that.
Illuminate.
Deluminate.
Isn't that nicer?
Go ahead, you try.
Illuminate.
Raymond, Raymond, we've got to talk.
How did you get in?
Wish I knew. I got pass codes.
Routes to underground kingdoms.
Complete access to the industrial data-grid interface.
I don't even know what that means.
But I've been meaning to ask you, because I like it!
I like it a lot!
You have been given these skills for a reason.
Not for your personal amusement.
Your job is to kill Mr. Edgar Friendly and stop a revolution.
That is why you were rehabilitated.
All right. I'm going to do your dastardly deed for you.
But it'll be more difficult than you thought.
I'm going to need some help.
I'll need about five or six more "special" men.
I happen to have a list.
I wouldn't want you to defrost any of those killer types, know what I mean?
And none of those motherfuckers from New York. They're too uptight.
So you're going to be the only killer type?
Fine.
Take care of it.
Just get it over with.
You're more trouble than you're worth.
Oh, Raymond, don't say that.
And what do I get out of all this?
What do you want?
Malibu.
Santa Monica.
Hell, how about all the coastal cities?
I'll bear it in mind.
-Good, I'll send you a memo.
-Just do your job!
What is John Spartan doing here?
Did you invite him to this party?
Look, you finish your business...
...and I'll stuff him back in the freezer.
Think of him as a guarantee.
"A guarantee?"
You don't have much of a guarantee.
I took care of Spartan once,
I'll take care of him again.
Now we need those men defrosted.
Is this where you live?
Very not bad.
Thank you.
Where will I be staying?
I've procured you a domicile down the corridor from my own.
Everything is voice coded, so if you need something, just ask.
Lights.
What do you think?
Clicked off a lot of credits to create the perfect 20th-century apartment.
It's very....
Isn't it?
John Spartan....
There's a well-known, documented...
...connection between sex and violence.
Not so much a causal effect...
...but a general state of neurological arousal.
And...
...after having observed your behavior this evening and...
...my resultant condition...
...I was wondering if you'd like to have sex?
With you?
Here?
Now?
Yeah.
Great!
I'll be right back.
Love Boat?
There you go.
Now, just relax.
We'll begin in a few seconds.
Begin what?
Having sex, of course.
You broke contact.
"Contact?" I didn't even touch you yet.
You said you wanted to make love.
Is that what this is?
Vir-sex produces high alpha waves during transference of sexual energies.
Let's do it the old-fashioned way.
Disgusting!
You mean...
-...fluid transfer?
-No, I mean boning, the wild mambo.
That is no longer done.
Do you know what the exchange of bodily fluids leads to?
Kids, smoking, desire to raid the fridge.
Rampant exchange of bodily fluids was a major cause of society's downfall.
After AlDS, there was NRS, then there was UBT.
One of the first things Cocteau did was to outlaw...
...and engineer all fluid transfer out of socially acceptable behavior.
Not even a mouth transfer's condoned.
Kissing's not allowed?
I was a good kisser.
What about kids?
Procreation?
We go to a lab.
Fluids are purified, screened...
...and transferred by authorized medical personnel only.
It is the only legal way.
What're you doing?
Breaking the law.
You are a savage creature.
I wish you to leave my domicile. Now!
You know....
Code accepted. Be well, John Spartan.
Lights.
"He doesn't know how to use the three seashells."
Happy Halloween.
"Behavioral engineering?"
Hi, Martin, I was thinking....
Oh, my God, I'm sorry, wrong number.
Our noble facility has been desecrated by hooligans.
Someone will pay dearly for this.
Sir, the stress breeder is inside being demobilized.
Shit! Being frozen must've thrown my aim off. Don't worry.
The next shot.
I don't think so.
No kiss-kiss, no bang-bang.
I'm sorry about last night.
I made this for you.
For me?
Thank you.
I'll drive.
I must learn to do this sometime.
Thanks for the lovely gift.
I don't know what was in my cryo-sludge but when I thawed, I wanted to knit.
How come I know what a zipperfoot, a shuttle and a bobbin is?
I could weave a throw rug now with my eyes closed.
It's part of your rehab program.
For each inmate the computer draws up a skill or trade...
...suited to their genetic disposition.
It implants the knowledge...
...and the desire to carry out the training assigned.
I'm a seamstress?
That's great.
I come out of cryo-prison and I'm Betsy-fucking-Ross.
Phoenix can access computers, operate all vehicles...
...knows the location of everything in town...
...and is three times stronger than before?
Can you get me his rehab program?
-I'm a seamstress.
-Access code for Simon Phoenix.
Access Simon Phoenix.
Accessing.
Access denied.
-What?
-Security override.
That can't be right.
Access granted, Officer Huxley.
Accessing Simon Phoenix,
Deepfile rehab 65-R.
Urban Combatkill.
Torture Methodology.
Computer Override Authority.
-There must be a mistake.
-Survival Tactics.
Terrorism Tactics. Weapons Training.
Martial Arts. MurderDeathKill.
Explosives Technician. Violent Behavior.
-This isn't a rehab program.
-No kidding.
This would create a monster.
Who develops these programs?
Cocteau lndustries.
But why would the benevolent...
...Dr. Cocteau send such a brute savage into our midst?
Good question. Let's go ask him.
You do not accuse our savior of being connected with a...
...multi-murderer like Phoenix. It's...
...rude.
I'll be subtle.
I'm good at subtle.
Mellow greetings.
We welcome you...
...to the Cocteau Behavioral
Engineering Complex.
Be well.
Enhance your calm, John Spartan.
Mellow apologies for my lack of physical disposition...
...but I have a city-gov to run.
Well, run this.
You programmed Phoenix's rehab to turn him into a terrorist.
And I don't think his escape was an accident.
Very subtle.
Outside the museum, why didn't he kill you?
What did you say?
I don't remember. Does it matter?
It matters. I saw the security disk.
He had 10 seconds to figure out where to put the hole in your head.
This display of barbaric behavior was unacceptable even in your time.
But it worked.
When Phoenix has a gun, 10 seconds is 9 1/2 seconds longer than you get.
Not everyone is as eager as you...
...to resort to violence to solve life's difficulties.
I wonder if the chaos in the museum was the result of Mr. Phoenix's presence.
Wonder about this...
...shithead.
If you think you got this maniac under control, trust me...
...you don't.
Is there something specific you plan to do with that archaic device?
No, I didn't think so.
The only thing I haven't got under control is you.
But that can be solved.
You, my Cro-Magnon friend, are dead.
Your family's dead...
...your past is dead.
Dead things cannot affect the living. So...
...enjoy your moment...
...of prehistoric bravado because after you leave here it will be over.
Like everything else in your life.
Officer, return this man to cryo-stasis immediately.
Be well.
Be fucked.
You are fined one credit--
Greetings, Citizen.
How are you on this glorious day?
I'll wait here.
Let's go.
-I don't know.
-I do know. Turn that thing on.
I hope you know what you're doing.
You're asking me to disobey a direct order.
I'm to escort you to the cryo-prison.
I must get that maniac and put him on ice or that's where I'll be.
-Enhance your calm.
-I've had it with enhancing my calm.
I'll enhance that psycho's calm.
Then I'll turn my attention to Cocteau.
You don't have to come with me.
I can do it alone.
Even if Phoenix was programmed to escape, kill and steal...
...why are you going to the wasteland?
Your city-wide manhunt didn't work because Phoenix was in a place...
...you can't monitor...
...afraid to go and don't give a shit about.
I want to go down there, find Phoenix and put him in a hurt locker.
Do you want to come? Or arrest me?
I'm with you.
Let's go blow this guy.
Away.
Blow this guy away.
Whatever.
She has a way with words.
What's wrong?
It's not very clean.
A real garden spot.
Okay, which way?
Over there.
Okay, be ready for anything.
"My dog's better than your dog
"My dog's better than yours
"My dog's better 'cause he gets Kennel-Ration"
I'm sorry, when I'm nervous, l....
Sorry.
Over here.
What's that emanation?
Come on.
Relax. I just want a burger and a beer.
How will I pay?
It's better to give.
Want a slug?
No, thank you.
I think I'll be sick.
Oh, God.
This is fantastic. You must try one.
Don't ask where the meat comes from.
What do you mean?
See any cows around here?
Rat?
This is a rat burger?
Not bad.
It's the best burger I've had in years.
See you later.
They don't seem very hostile,
John Spartan.
No, they don't.
Now that's a thing of beauty.
Do you know what this is?
A 1970 Oldsmobile 442.
With a 455-cubic-inch engine.
Radial tires and bucket seats.
I'm impressed.
I studied.
So did l. Hand over the glow-rod.
Your friends too. Come on.
You got balls, coming down here.
We're looking for a MurderDeathKiller.
Can you help us or just bully us with your primitive weapons?
Maybe they're not so primitive.
You think you're taking me in?
Guess what?
Not happening.
Tell Cocteau he can kiss my ass.
That's right.
It'll take an army to get rid of me.
I don't give a shit. I got nothing to lose.
I don't know who the hell you are, let alone want to take you anywhere.
So stay here, be well and Cocteau's an asshole!
Let's dump them up top.
They're only here to spy on us.
Wait a minute.
You're the guy outside Pizza Hut.
What do you want?
You weren't part of the Cocteau plan.
Greed, deception, abuse of power.
That's no plan.
-That's why you're here?
-That's right.
See....
According to Cocteau's plan...
...I'm an enemy because I like to think.
I like to read.
I'm into freedom of speech and choice.
I like to sit in a greasy spoon...
...and think, "Should I have steak or barbecued ribs with gravy fries?"
I want high cholesterol.
I want to eat bacon, butter and cheese.
I want to smoke a Cuban cigar the size of Cincinnati.
I want to run through the streets naked...
...reading Playboy magazine because I might need to.
I've seen the future.
It's a 47-year-old virgin...
...drinking a banana-broccoli shake and singing "I'm a wiener."
Up top, you live Cocteau's way.
What he wants, when he wants, how he wants.
Your other choice: come here.
Maybe starve to death.
Why don't you take charge and lead these people out of here?
I'm no leader.
I do what I have to do.
Sometimes people join me.
I just want to bury Cocteau up to his neck in shit and let him think happy thoughts.
Then I got bad news.
I think he wants to kill you.
All right gentlemen, let's review.
The year is 2032.
That's 2-0-3-2. As in the 21st century.
And I'm sorry to say that the world has become a pussy-whipped...
...Brady Bunch version of itself run by a bunch of robed sissies.
All we have to do to run the whole thing...
...is to kill a man named Friendly, who put it all together.
But there's an extra added bonus.
We get to kill...
...the man who put us in the freezer.
You mean...
...we get to kill John Spartan?
Exactly.
I want you to loot, pillage, plunder, and steal.
Do all the wonderful things we used to do before any of this happened.
This world will be ours!
Let's bring back the good old days!
Are you with me?
Are you with me? Let's do it!
It is a curious conclusion which you have deduced, John Spartan.
But I can find no fault in your logic.
Phoenix is the perfect weapon to send into these savage regions.
I'm impressed, John Spartan.
They thawed him out just to kill me?
-I'm flattered.
-Don't be flattered. Be frightened.
This guy's a certifiable nightmare.
That's why you're here?
I must have done something right in the previous life.
Can't imagine what that could have been.
Two for the price of one.
Let's take them.
Stay down!
I'll be damned.
Like a New York cockroach.
Everything's gone wrong.
There's an elevator shaft at the top.
So we're going up?
Momentito, Senorita Huxley. Come on.
How nice! Must've been expecting me.
Now what?
Buckle up.
There he is! He's in my car!
Goddamn it.
What's happening to cops today?
Don't you know you are endangering civilians?
Auto-inflate!
Auto-inflate.
That was lovely.
Huxley, drive!
Okay, I've read all about this.
What do I do? Push this pedal?
Okay, I got it.
Punch it!
Excuse me?
Push the pedal as hard as you can!
No free rides!
Emergency, doors open.
Doors opening.
Say hello to my friend.
Doors close!
Malfunction.
Computer, auto-drive.
Auto-drive engaged.
Going to give you a haircut!
Remember the 40 bus passengers...
...you blew up trying to get me?
They were already dead.
Cold as Haagen-Dazs!
I went to jail with a 36-year smile.
You're dead.
Speak for yourself.
Self-drive!
Unable to execute.
-Self-drive! Now!
-Malfunction.
Unable to execute.
Emergency!
Brake!
Self-drive engaged.
Brake! Brake!
Brake now, you,
Mickey Mouse piece of shit!
Are you in there?
Who do you think it is, Huxley?
I thought your life force had been prematurely terminated!
I thought I was history too.
What happened? All of a sudden, this car turned into a cannoli.
It's the curefoam. It saved your life.
Look at you, you're in shambles.
I can fix it later.
All I need is a needle and thread.
Did I really say that?
You caveman, you're under arrest!
You're to be returned to the cryo-prison.
Immediately!
I heard all that. We'll talk later, Chief.
I need something. A shotgun, a flare gun.
Shit!
Defensive red alert!
Stun batons on.
Relax.
Did you bump your noggin...
...and think you're Pancho Villa?
Who?
Never mind.
Time to take a stand.
Good. While you're doing it, loan me a gun. Two guns.
You'd use these weapons against men and women who uphold the law?
We use these weapons to shop for groceries, dick.
You can't leave.
You're under arrest. This very concept negates the possibility of your leaving.
Skip it, Chief.
Lieutenant Huxley!
Chief...
...you can take this job and you can shovel it.
"Take this job...
"...and shovel it."
Close enough.
I hadn't counted on this but I must say, you worked out beautifully.
People are terrified of you.
What's new? People have always been terrified of me.
But this time they're really intimidated.
Now...
...I'll have carte blanche to create the perfect society.
My society.
San Angeles will be a beacon of order...
...with the purity of an ant colony.
And the beauty of a flawless pearl.
People have a right to be assholes.
You remind me of...
...an evil Mr. Rogers.
Will you please kill him?
He's pissing me off.
Put another log on the fire!
I'll love running this place!
Well, now...
...what shall I do with you?
I am an excellent associate, sir.
I'd be delighted to continue my services during your administration.
Maybe we'd use--
Excuse me, the police are here.
Oh, man!
What the hell are you doing?
I'm impressed.
That man has died by my hands.
It was either him or us.
There is that.
Where'd you learn to kick like that?
Jackie Chan movies.
Looks like the Cocteau plan went up in smoke.
Rest in peace, Raymond Cocteau.
John Spartan, civilization as we know it will come to an end.
What will we do?
I don't know. But this is better for you.
What's that?
This is bad.
This is very bad.
He's accessed the cryo-prison and is about to defrost the multi-lifers.
They don't like you.
Most of these guys don't like their own mothers. They're bad boys.
How many are there?
Eighty.
All without rehab.
They'll be re-animated within the hour.
We must stop this.
I'm not at all pleased about having caused the fatality of a convict.
I now understand that under certain circumstances violence is necessary.
Good.
I hope you understand this.
I hope my butt didn't look like that.
Okay, who do we have left that's good?
Let's see...
...Foulks, Patrick.
Jeffrey Dahmer? I love that guy.
How long before the rest are done?
They're in the final stages of reanimation.
Great. Absolutely great.
Gentlemen!
Thank you, but your services are no longer required.
Send a maniac to catch a maniac.
Attention.
Attention.
Cryo-prisoner defrosting re-animation sequence...
...now entering final stage.
Count down to reanimation of prisoner batches...
Ten minutes.
-That's it. The very last one.
-Excellent.
Accessed.
What the hell is that?
Didn't expect that, did you?
Where are you going?
I wish you the best of luck.
Stupid.
How's it hanging?
I'm sure you're familiar with the long arm of the law.
Why don't you struggle a little bit?
Make me work for it!
What do you say? How about...
...a little target practice. What do you say?
Did that hurt your head?
Shit! Goddamn!
Fuck!
That's it!
You won't get out of this one!
I'll drop you in that vat of defrost...
...and fry you like a chicken...
...or with my little pinky, drop your monkey ass--
I'll be damned.
Shit! Goddamn!
What am I doing wrong?
Cryo-prisoner re-animation...
...sequence now entering final stage.
"ls it cold in here, or is it just me?"
Good memory.
Come here!
Shit!
I hate cops!
Look into my eyes. I'll see you in hell.
Not.
This is the best day of my life.
Heads up!
Did you apprehend the villain responsible for murdering Cocteau?
I wouldn't say "apprehend."
But he's history.
And the cryo-prison...
...is history too.
What'll we do?
How will we live?
We'll go out drinking, get shit-faced and paint the town.
Graffiti slogans, it'll be a blast.
This is what you'll do.
You'll get a little dirty...
...you, a lot clean.
And somewhere in the middle....
You'll figure it out.
Fucking-A!
Well put.
Greetings and salutations.
I'm Associate Bob. And may I say...
...it would be a pleasure to help you create a more humane--
Let's talk about the hair, okay?
Pick a color. And lose the kimono.
You look like a couch.
What are you, a surgeon with these gloves?
Thanks for rendering me unconscious.
I did it for your own good.
-We're supposed to be a team.
-We are.
Oh, my.
Are all fluid transfer activities like this?
-Better.
-Better?
Oh, my.
I think I'll like the future.
Now that you've demolished everything.
But there's one thing I want to know.
How's that damn three-seashell thing work?
This is the Earth at a time when the dinosaurs roamed a lush and fertile planet.
A piece of rock just six miles wide changed all that.
It hit with the force of 10,000 nuclear weapons.
A trillion tons of dirt and rock hurtled into the atmosphere, creating a suffocating blanket of dust the sun was powerless to penetrate for a thousand years.
It happened before.
It will happen again.
It's just a question of when.
Houston, affirmative.
Now try again.
Almost got it.
- Atlantis, I'm almost there.
- Houston, Pete's lookin' real strong.
Okay, Pete, we got that coupling on the board here now.
We'll give you the go-ahead from down here when it's in alignment.
Sounds good. Give me ten seconds.
His heart rate's racing. Hey, Pete.
- It's Truman.
- Hey.
- How you doing up there, hoss?
- Pretty good.
Listen, Pete, we got an eye on your meds here.
I'll give you a buffalo nickel if you'll calm down just a little bit.
- Can you do that for me?
- Whatever you say.
Okay, now, we got plenty of time, buddy, so don't you worry.
Looking good here.
He'll be all right.
- Go ahead, Atlantis.
- Roger that, Houston.
Suggest we start reeling Pete in.
- What the hell is that?
- My Lord.
We're down!
Houston!
We've lost all contact.
Stewart, play that tape back!
Houston!
Multiple bogies! Multiple bogies!
Sector five, niner. I have three. Now five.
- Unidentified tracks.
- My screen's full.
Multiple tracks headed toward the Atlantic seaboard!
This could be a surprise missile attack.
Mr. President, the shuttle
Atlantis just exploded in space.
Okay, I want three groups!
One, internal malfunction.
Get the log tape.
Start working back. Maybe it's a glitch.
Two, I want NORAD,
Space Command and the 50th tactical, comparing all the space junk you tracked in every orbit.
I want you to check, recheck and then do it all over again.
Number three, wild cards.
Anything and everything.
All right? Now, Big Ross, get on the telephone. Wake up 11,000 people.
- Walt, get 'em going.
- Let's go!
Karl. Karl! Karl.
Karl! Your Stouffer's pot pie's been on the table almost ten hours.
- I want a divorce.
- Dottie, I'm on to something big here.
I... I don't know what this is, but it looks like something's burnin' up there.
Go get my phone book, will you?
Get my phone book.
Get those names of those guys from NASA.
Excuse me! Am I wearing a sign that says, "Karl's Slave"?
Go get my goddamn phone book!
Get the book! Get the book!
Get the book!
Space Command is reporting negative.
That is zero global launches.
It might just be a piece of the shuttle breaking up as it comes in.
It might be Santa Claus.
Until we get definitive, reliable confirmation, General, we go to DEFCON Three.
I'm gettin' ready for the big time
Someday you're gonna say
I'm big time, too
Hey, little man! Little Richard!
Me and you, man!
We're going to the top, baby!
Big time! I ain't gonna be ridin' this bike for the rest of my life.
You know what I'm sayin'?
I'm gettin' a motorcycle, baby.
We're gonna travel in style.
I'm gettin' ready for the big time
Someday I'm gonna be in big time news
Watch where you're goin'. I bet you, none of you all stop for brothers.
Slow down, Little Richard.
You've been ridin' all morning.
You gotta take a dump?
We interrupt our regularly scheduled program...
- What happened?
... to bring you this special report.
The shuttle ATLantis exploded in space at 3:47 a. m., Eastern Standard Time.
Hey! Get, get.
- That's my Godzilla. Come on, now.
- Yo, fool!
Don't be kickin' Little Richard.
What the hell your problem?
That dog's eatin' my Godzilla. What's a little runt like you gonna do about it?
Get him, Richard. Sic him.
If I wasn't no Christian,
I'd be throwin' your fat pineapple-eatin' ass through the window.
Why we not going?
You know why?
'Cause this is New York City.
Anything could happen. Let's see.
Could've been a terrorist bomb.
Could've been a dead body. Somebody shot, stabbed, and it's Friday, payday.
Dude, somebody probably didn't get their paycheck. Yes?
I want to go shopping.
Me, too, but we ain't goin' nowhere
'cause this is a traffic jam.
- Little Richard!
- Right over there!
Little Richard!
Hang on, Little Richard. I'm comin'!
Don't you worry about it.
I'm gonna get you outta there!
You okay, buddy?
Don't worry about it. Hang in there.
Somebody dial 911!
My screen's full.
They're all over the place.
Bogies are breachin' the atmosphere from Finland down the North American seaboard.
Look at that!
Oh, we at war!
Saddam Hussein is bombing us!
Let's stay focused. We need to
- map the trajectory now.
- That could take a week.
Just find it, okay? I wanna know if the worst is over or if it's on its way.
We've got General Kimsey on the line.
We've got hits from Finland to South Carolina.
We know they're not missiles.
Now what the hell is it?
It's a meteor shower.
That's what took out the shuttle.
I've got the president on AirForce One demanding answers.
Is it over?
General, we've got 11,000 people at
NASA trying to figure that out right now.
When we know, you'll know.
Okay, Karl, listen.
I want you to take your time.
Yes, sir. You're definitely the first.
Okay, first coordinate.
One-two-three-nine. 1239, right?
- F.B.I. locked his location.
- Saw an explosion in space.
Okay.
- Listen, Karl, this is top secret.
- Sir, I'm retired Navy.
I know all about classified.
But one more thing.
The person that finds her gets to name her, right?
- Yes, that's right.
- I wanna name her Dottie, after my wife.
She's a vicious life-suckin' bitch from which there's no escape.
- That's sweet, Karl.
- S.D.I., this is flight director!
I wanna get that Hubble movin', and I want it now.
Roger that.
We're movin' the Hubble!
It's enormous.
This is the anomaly at 1643.
Here is the anomaly at 1658, and here is the anomaly at 1700.
Enough with this anomaly horseshit!
- What is this thing?
- It's an asteroid, sir.
How big are we talking?
Sir, our best estimate is 97.6 billion...
- It's the size of Texas, Mr. President.
- Y-Yes, sir.
Dan, we didn't see this thing coming?
Well, our object collision budget's a million dollars.
That allows us to track about three percent of the sky.
And begging your pardon, sir, it's a big-ass sky.
- And the ones this morning?
- Those are nothing.
They're the size of basketballs and Volkswagens, things like that.
- Is this going to hit us?
- We're efforting that as we speak, sir.
- What kind of damage are we...
- Damage?
Total, sir.
It's what we call a global killer.
The end of mankind.
Doesn't matter where it hits.
Nothing would survive.
Not even bacteria.
My God. What do we do?
We have 18 days before it hits Earth.
Have mercy
Rise and shine!
Stop the drilling!
Stop the drilling! Stop the drilling!
Fore!
Stop the drilling! Stop the drilling!
- Hey!
- Hey, that was close!
I give you 50,000 a year in donations.
What do you think they're so mad about, Chick?
Well, I think they feel that drilling for oil is an evil thing.
You know how much diesel that clunker boat pumps out an hour?
I just found out something interesting.
Number two chewed 180 feet last night.
- Who do we have to thank for this?
- I'll give you two guesses.
But you're only gonna need one.
Goddamn it, A.J.!
A.J.!
A.J.! A.J., you in here?
Oh, that's just perfect. In bed. Get up!
- Uh, hey, you wanted to see me?
- Yeah, I was lookin' for ya.
You're pissed. Okay, I can see that.
No. You know what, A.J.?
I'm not pissed. You've seen me pissed.
This is way, way beyond pissed, though.
You know I shut down number two last night, right?
- Yeah, man, I had a hunch on that.
- Let me tell you something.
Someday, many years from now, when you're all growed up, and you got your own oil company and $8 million of your own money on the contract, you can do whatever comes into that little A.J. -idiotin' mind of yours you want.
But as long as it says
"Harry Stamper Oil" on the rig, you will not disobey my rules.
- You got that?
- Yeah, I do got it.
All right, now I need to hear five words from you.
- Uh...
- I'll...
Never do that again.
I'm a fool. That was idiotic.
I... I mean, that was stupid.
I'm an idiot. I know what name's on the sign. I'm not...
- What's goin' on here?
- What's goin' on?
Well, I mean, you know,
I screwed up. I'm a little edgy.
- How long you work for me?
- Five wonderful years.
In five years, you have never apologized to me this quickly.
Something's going on here.
I'm gonna find out what it is.
Well, I'm turning over a new leaf.
I'm trying to learn from the man.
What would Harry do?
I'm at a loss for words.
Okay, I can explain this.
- You can explain that?
- I can.
I would really like an explanation.
You just stay right here.
Grace?
Hi, Harry.
I have asked you repeatedly to call me Dad.
Sorry, Harry.
Get up and get your clothes on.
You just stay right there.
I'll be right back.
Here's what we're gonna do.
I want every strategy we've got on near-Earth object collision.
Okay? Any ideas, any programs, anything you sketched on a pizza box or cocktail napkin.
For 30 years, they questioned the need for NASA.
Today, we're gonna give 'em the answer.
You know about this, Rockhound?
- You knew?
- No, I had no idea.
Where's Harry?
Harry, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
I understand, okay?
You're mad.
Who... Who wouldn't be mad?
- He's gonna shoot you.
- Nah, no, he's not.
Oh, shit.
- Harry!
- What's wrong with you?
Make your peace with God, A.J.!
This guy's got a gun, man.
He's shooting at me.
Harry, this is not funny!
Harry, listen to me!
We can talk this over!
- Oh, is this a serious thing?
- Yeah, pretty serious.
- Bear!
- What's up?
He's shootin' at me. You see Harry comin', crack him with that wrench.
You told A.J.'s dad just before he died that you would take care of the boy.
Now I'm not sure that shootin' him is takin' care of him.
Why don't you put the gun down?
You don't want none of this.
Get out of my way.
Just tryin' to give my man a head start, that's all.
Not to mention the fact that I don't think you wanna kill the best man on your crew,
- before we strike oil.
- Aw, Chick, I ain't gonna kill him.
Just gonna take a foot off.
A man can work with one foot.
You remember old Frank Marx who worked with one hand all them years?
Yeah, but he wasn't very good.
Harry, put the gun down!
You're acting insane!
Now, honey, go get some clothes on and get out of the way.
- You can't control my life!
- Fine. Clothes. Now!
All right, stop! All right!
It was funny for a minute.
It's not funny anymore.
- Fuck!
- Harry, this is illegal, man.
I'm temporarily insane, Rock.
It's all right.
- Do I look like I'm crazy to you?
- Well...
Harry! Hey, just cool down.
What are you doing?
Harry, stop! Cut it out.
- All right, Harry.
- All right, now, listen.
Man to man. I'm serious. I love her.
Way wrong answer!
- Whoa, whoa, Harry. It's gettin' real.
- Harry! Come on, Harry!
- You shot me!
- You shot him.
That bullet never got close.
Just a ricochet.
You know, it's all funny till somebody gets shot in the leg!
Hey, pucker up.
We got clients incoming.
Uh, b-back in-in... In 1974, we-we first got the idea the-the possibility that-that a meteor or an asteroid...
I need somebody who's had a little less caffeine this morning. Doc, translate.
Yes, sir. Our first feasibility plan was to use a spread-focus laser generator to heat the object to the point of fracture.
That's like shooting a B.B. gun at a freight train, Doc.
Uh, some of us have got this idea.
We wanna land a craft, deploy solar sails.
You'll have a big canopy. Solar winds will be caught by these Mylar sails.
- Okay...
- Come on, guys!
We gotta come up with something realistic here. We got 18 days.
That's 431 hours, 15 minutes and 18 seconds.
Time's a luxury we don't have. What?
Listen, Harry, A.J. is my choice.
My choice and not yours.
He's the only one in your age bracket, Grace.
It's not a choice. It's a lack of options.
I don't know what in the world makes you think that you have the right to tell me what to do anymore, Harry.
I suppose being your father doesn't count, huh?
- Not really.
- Since when?
Since I reached the age of ten and became older than you, Harry.
Since Mom split.
Why don't you take your pick?
Look, I understand that you are handicapped by natural immaturity, and I forgive you.
I may be an immature father, but I'm still your employer.
And as your boss,
I want you on that crew boat tonight and back in the office by Monday.
- You got that?
- Okay. I quit.
Grace, you can't quit now!
I need you to keep on working.
Hi, Harry!
What are you smilin' about?
I've been seein' A.J. for more than five months, Harry.
You little hypocrite. I ever held you back once from doing anything?
What about having a life, Harry?
The first time I got my period,
Rockhound had to take me into Taipei for Tampax and then he had to show me how to use 'em, Harry.
Ho-ho.
I ju... No, I... I told her how to use it.
I didn't show her, Harry.
I was playing with titanium depth gauges when I should've been playing with dolls.
I mean, I learned about the birds and the bees from Freddy Noonan's tattoos.
Look, I was raised on roughnecks by you.
And now you get all shocked and shaken when I fall in love with one.
So who's the hypocrite here,
Harry, huh?
Look at those nice pipes.
- Listen to me, Grace.
- No, you listen to me, Harry. I grew up.
With the proximity of the asteroid and no prep time, none of our primary plans can work.
Why don't we just send up 150 nuclear warheads and blast that rock apart?
Terrible idea.
Was I talkin' to you?
This is Dr. Ronald Quincy from Research.
Pretty much the smartest man on the planet. You might wanna listen to him.
General, if you consider your target, her composition, her dimensions, her sheer velocity, you could fire every nuke you've got on her, she'll just smile at you and keep on coming.
You should know that the president's scientific advisors are suggesting that a nuclear blast could change this asteroid's trajectory.
I know the president's chief scientific advisor. We were at M.I.T. together.
And, in a situation like this...
You really don't wanna take the advice from a man who got a C-minus in astrophysics.
The president's advisors are wrong.
I'm right.
Hitting the rock from the outside won't do the job.
Imagine a firecracker in the palm of your hand.
You set it off. What happens?
Burn your hand, right?
You close your fist around the same firecracker and set it off...
Poof! Your wife's gonna be opening your ketchup bottles the rest of your life.
Are you suggesting that we blow this thing up from the inside?
- That's exactly what I'm saying.
- How?
We drill.
We bring in the world's best deep-core driller.
Harry, get up here. We're takin' a hit.
- Get A.J. up here!
- Come on!
Oh, shit!
Send another pipe down! Right now!
It's a gas pocket!
I told you! Am I lucky, or am I just a genius?
I shut it down for a reason, you jackass! The relief valve's...
Shut off the number two valve!
Grace, get the clients out of here now!
No, Daddy!
Chick, get 'em outta here!
Get 'em off the rig now!
- Get the hell down!
- This thing is gonna blow.
Chick, get down now!
Get down!
Three dozen research calls, and every time, the same man is recommended.
He's worked on every terrain this planet can offer.
Whenever they said it couldn't be drilled, this guy drilled it.
- Everybody all right?
- We struck oil, baby!
Somebody could've got killed out here today.
You want that on your conscience?
High thumb. You are man, Harry.
Thumbs high.
You're fired.
Who's Harry Stamper?
Hey, I'm Harry Stamper.
What's all this about?
Mr. Stamper, I'm General Montgomery, commander of the Pacific Air Forces.
I've been sent here by the Secretary of Defense on direct orders from the President of the United States.
It's a matter of urgent national security.
I need you to get on that chopper right now, no questions asked.
Crazy Willie put you up to this?
I'm afraid I don't know Crazy Willie, sir. I'm dead serious about this.
- Harry.
- What?
I swear to God, she never told me her age.
It's all right. Relax. It's about me.
Oh. Forget it!
All right, General,
I'll go with you on one condition.
We're gonna have to take my daughter along.
What did I do?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where you guys takin' her?
- Sir, stay right here.
- Wh...
Chick, get him paid, get him off the rig!
- Mr. Stamper?
- Yeah, I'm Harry Stamper.
How you doin'? Miss Stamper.
I'm Dan Truman,
Executive Director here.
Listen, on behalf of all of us,
I'd really like to apologize...
Apologize. I don't know if we can take any more apologies, Mr. Truman.
We've been apologized to for the last 18-and-a-half hours.
So if you don't mind, how about if we just get on with it?
You tell us why we're here at the NASA Space Center.
We should probably talk alone.
Mr. Truman, I don't keep any secrets from my daughter, Grace.
So whether you tell her now or I tell her later, she's gonna find out one way or the other.
So, why don't we just get on with it?
So when the Rogue comet hit the asteroid belt, it sent shrapnel right for us.
For the next 15 days, the Earth's in a shooting gallery.
Even if the asteroid itself hits the water, it's still hitting land.
It'll flash boil millions of gallons of seawater and slam into the ocean bedrock.
Now, if it's a Pacific Ocean impact, which we think it will be, it'll create a tidal wave three miles high, traveling at 1,000 miles an hour covering California and washing up in Denver.
Japan's gone. Australia's wiped out.
Half the world's population will be incinerated by the heat blast.
The rest'll freeze to death from nuclear winter.
That's unbelievable.
Well, actually, this is as real as it gets.
Well, it's coming right now.
Right for us at 22,000 miles an hour.
Not a soul on Earth can hide from it.
I take it you're not alerting everyone like this.
Nobody knows. That's the way it stays.
For the next ten days, there are only nine telescopes in the world that can spot the asteroid, and we control eight of 'em.
The president's classified this information top secret.
If news like this got out, there'd be an overnight breakdown of basic social services worldwide.
Rioting, mass religious hysteria, total chaos, you can imagine.
Basically the worst parts of the Bible.
Six billion people on the planet.
Why'd you guys call me?
We need you to prep the team
- we're sending up.
- Up?
We'll send them to the asteroid, they'll land, drill a hole, they'll drop some nukes, take off and detonate, if we can fix this equipment problem.
The drilling unit's a prototype we've been building for the Mars project.
You, uh... You might recognize the rig.
Yeah, well, I guess
I should recognize it. It's my design.
Did you steal a key to the Patent Office?
Yeah, basically.
Let me get this straight.
I got pulled off an oil rig, flown halfway around the world because you stole my drill design.
Couldn't read the plans right and did a pisspoor job of putting it together.
- Patents don't apply to outer space.
- You shut up, Quincy.
It's not going to Mars anymore.
It's gonna try to save this planet.
And we need to know what's wrong with it pretty quick.
You said we did a bad job of putting it together?
No, I said you did a pisspoor job of putting it together.
First of all, you got the flow system all reversed. Let me guess.
You've been tearin' up rotors and you can't figure out why.
Yeah, that's right.
Well, that's because your cams are all wrong, Mr. Wizard.
Who's been operating this thing?
- Right there.
- We've actually...
We've had them training for eight months solid now.
Eight whole months?
- Well, pretty much, yeah.
- Well, gee whiz.
Well, this is the team that has to do the job up there.
We need you to train them down here.
Well, Mr. Stamper, what do you think?
You know, drilling's a science.
It's an art.
I'm a third generation driller, doin' it all my life.
I still haven't got it all figured out.
I assume you sent for me because somebody told you I was the best.
Well, I'm only the best because I work with the best.
You don't trust the men you're working with, you're as good as dead.
Now you wanna send these boys into space, fine.
I'm sure they'll make good astronauts, but they don't knowjack about drillin'.
- What's your contingency plan?
- Contingency plan?
Your backup plan. You gotta have some kind of backup plan, right?
No, we don't have a backup plan.
- This is it.
- This is the best that you could...
That the government...
The U.S. government can come up with.
I mean, you're NASA for cryin' out loud.
You put a man on the moon.
You're geniuses.
You're the guys that think this shit up.
I'm sure you got a team of men sittin' around somewhere right now, just thinkin' shit up and somebody backin' them up.
You tell me you don't have a backup plan, that these eight Boy Scouts right here, that is the world's hope, that's what you're tellin' me?
- Yeah.
- Oh, Jesus. Damn it.
We're a little short on time here.
Will you help us?
- All they gotta do is drill?
- That's it.
No spacewalkin', no crazy astronaut stuff.
Just drill.
How many men were you plannin' on takin' up there?
We're sendin' up two shuttles, two teams.
If I do this,
I'm gonna wanna take my own men.
You got it.
- So you're saying you'll help us?
- Yes, sir.
Thanks.
I just don't trust anybody else to do it, that's all.
No, Mrs. Curlene.
It's Harry Stamper. You see Bear, you tell him Harry's lookin' for him.
Those guys get off this rig, they scatter.
Jayotis Kerleen Bear.
Probably the only black man on a big dog in Kadoka, South Dakota.
Come and get Papa Bear!
- Uh, Max.
- You got a weight limit on the shuttle?
- Max.
- Hey, Mama.
So sweet, Maxie.
Hey, would you give me one of them yellowjelly bear claws I like?
- Are you in trouble with the law again?
- No, Mama.
- Maxie.
- I swear, Mama. I'm...
You know I want Rockhound.
We call him Hound because, well, he's horny.
You might wanna start with every bar in New Orleans.
That is a big, shiny mount, isn't it?
- How long you been married?
- For two weeks.
- See this diamond?
- Yeah.
It's not a diamond.
- Would you like another drink?
- Yeah.
- Sir, F.B.I.
- So cute. No, thanks.
- We have a national security matter.
- Good for you.
- Let's go. Now.
- How old are you?
Oscar Choi. Spacy but absolutely brilliant geologist.
He owns a horse ranch outside of El Paso.
What the...
Mr. Chick Chapple, at the craps table.
Caesar's Palace, Las Vegas, Nevada.
Yes! About time.
Charles Chapple, game's over.
Who's gonna run the other rig?
How about Benny? He's good.
The only one who knows how to run it as well as I do is A.J.
I thought you said you couldn't trust him.
I thought you said I could.
Yep, you are on your way, A.J.
Well, being in business for yourself has its advantages.
Make my own hours, nobody shoots me in the leg.
You don't got a gun on you now, do you?
Oh, good, 'cause I kinda wanted to get back to this whole thing about you askin' me for help.
Does that mean that there's a job that Mr. All-Go-No-Quit-Big-Nuts
Harry Stamper can't handle by himself and needs my expert advice?
Somethin' like that, yeah.
Well, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I mean, is it something like that, or is it that?
You know, you and me got a real problem.
You know, Harry, there are only five words I wanna hear from you right now.
Those words are:
You know, A.J., I really look up to you.
You've been a hero of mine for a long time, and I'm very impressed with your work.
I'm emotionally closed off.
That's like...
That's like 11 words or something.
You know what?
How about just, "A.J., I'm sorry,
- and I love ya. "
- You know, A.J., there's not a job on the planet
I want you to work with me on.
I mean that.
So what are you doin' here?
Harry, what's the job?
- Hey, Bear.
- What's up, baby?
Yeah, baby. What's up? What's up?
What's up, Harry?
Did NASA find oil on Uranus, man?
None of you have to go.
We can just sit here on Earth, wait for this big rock to crash into it and kill everything and everybody we know.
The United States government just asked us to save the world.
- Anybody wanna say no?
- Twenty years.
Haven't turned you down once.
I'm not about to start now.
I'm there.
Guess I can't let you go up there alone.
I'm with you.
I mean, this is... This is historic.
Guys, this is like deep blue hero stuff.
Of course I'm in.
While I don't share his enthusiasm, you know me.
Beam me up, Scotty.
- You all right, Max?
- I-I don't... I-I don't...
Whatever you think.
- What about you?
- I'm in.
All right, then.
We go.
I don't mean to be the materialistic weasel of this group, but you think we'll get hazard pay out of this?
If you're trying to make me feel better about this scenario, give it up.
To tell you the truth, I'm kind of encouraged. This guy Chick here was an Air Force commando for six years.
We got robbery, assault, arrest, resisting arrest.
We got a collection agent for the mob.
Two of these guys have done serious time.
- Look, they're the best at what they do.
- So am I.
And I'm not so optimistic.
We spend $250 billion a year on defense.
And here we are. The fate of the planet is in the hands of a bunch of retards
I wouldn't trust with a potato gun.
So, what's the verdict?
They'll do it. They've made a few requests though.
Such as?
Just a few things here.
Nothing really big.
Just... Well, as an example...
Uh, Oscar here's got some outstanding parking tickets.
Wants 'em wiped off his record.
Fifty-six tickets in seven states.
- I'll tell him, Oscar. I got it.
- Okay.
Uh, Noonan's got two women friends that he'd like to see made
American citizens, no questions asked.
Max would like you to bring back eight-track tapes.
Not sure if that's gonna work, but let's see what else.
Chick wants a full week's
Emperor's Package at Caesar's Palace.
Hey, you guys wouldn't be able to tell us who actually killed Kennedy, would ya?
Uh, Bear would like to stay at the...
White Horse.
White House. White House.
White House. Yeah, he'd like to stay in the Lincoln Bedroom of the White House for the summer.
Stuff like that.
Sure, I think we can take care of some of that.
Harry!
Yeah, one more thing.
None of them wanna pay taxes again.
Ever.
Who's that for? Mr. Ed?
You stick that in me, I'm gonna stab you in the heart with it.
You ever see Pulp Fiction?
Oh, say can you see
Uh-oh.
We're losin' him, we're losin' him.
Clear! Kaboom!
- Freddy, you all right?
- Does this look okay to you?
- Does this look okay?
- It's not all bad. It's kinda tingly.
Mr. Chapple, you're next!
Oh, gee, lady, I just came here to drill.
Oh, so did I.
Your triglycerides are way high, and your bad cholesterol is shockingly bad.
Gotta lay off those pork rinds, Bear!
Pork rinds this! Yeah!
Well, at least they're in good spirits.
Piece of cake.
Look, you wanna compare brain pans?
I won the Westinghouse prize when I was 12. Big deal.
Published at 19. So what? I got a double doctorate from M.I.T. at 22.
Chemistry and geology. I taught at Princeton for two-and-a-half years.
You know, I think this might be the most uncomfortable room
I've ever been in in my life.
Why do I do this? Because the money's good, the scenery changes, and they let me use explosives, okay?
Okay, you wanna be all psychological with me, that's fine.
I'll tell you one thing that really drives me nuts is people who think Jethro Tull is just a person in the band.
Who is Jethro Tull?
My favorite dish is haggis.
Heart, lungs, liver.
You shove that all in a sheep's stomach, then you boil it.
That'll put some hair on your ass.
I am not crazy. I'm just a little emotional right now, okay?
You're all throwin' all this stuff at me, man. I mean...
After this is over, could I, like, get a hug from you or somethin'?
Okay, Cyclops lady is startin' to bug me.
Can you handle it?
I mean, I can handle what I'm, you know, gonna do.
I can handle that, but I don't know if I can handle this room.
Woman with large breasts.
Woman with medium breasts.
Here's Harry givin' me a hard time.
And this is Harry tellin' me it's not good enough.
And this is Harry tellin' me
I can't marry his daughter.
Thanks a lot. I appreciate it.
Just let it out.
I suffered a major head injury when I was in high school.
This one looks like you, with breasts.
Yeah, I can handle it.
Yeah, I can handle it.
A home run!
The Cubs win the World Series! Ah...
Fail. Fail. Depressively fail.
One toxicology analysis revealed catamen.
That is a very powerful sedative.
Sedatives are used all the time, Doctor.
This one's used on horses.
Some of these guys are pretty big.
It would normally take 18 months to psychologically prepare, prescreen viable subjects for space travel.
We have seen evidence of a wide variety of territorial aggression.
Can they physically survive the trip?
That's all I need to know here, okay?
Personally, I don't know how they survived the tests.
Talk about the wrong stuff.
Good morning. I'm Colonel Willie Sharp.
In addition to flying one of the X-71 teams to that rock, my job is to train you to deal with the mental and physical rigors of working in space, so you don't freak out on the asteroid.
United States astronauts train for years.
You have 12 days.
Do we have any intelligent questions before we get started?
What's an X-71?
You're the first civilians to ever see her.
We call 'em the X-71 s.
It's a top secret joint venture with the Air Force.
She and her sister ship in Vandenberg are leaving for launch prep in Florida.
Thought you oughta take a look.
The two shuttles going up are the Freedom and Independence.
Her titanium alloy impenetrable skin covers the toughest, meanest, most sophisticated space vehicle man has ever made.
Okay, Air Force Colonel Davis,
NASA pilot Tucker will command the shuttle
Independence.
Air Force Colonel Sharp,
NASA pilot Watts, shuttle Freedom.
Munitions specialist Gruber and Halsey will supervise the nuclear ordinance.
Anyway, I just thought...
Thought you guys should meet.
Gentlemen, welcome to our weightless environmental training facility.
So we're going swimming on this asteroid. Is that what this is for?
Here at downtown NASA, we call this monster "Armadillo. "
Going to be retrofitted with your drilling arm.
She'll turn 800 turbo horses in near-zero gravity.
Mind if we take a look at her now?
All these rubber hoses gotta go, Max. Count 'em up.
Make sure it's short-throw shifters.
Quincy! Somebody tell me what this is.
Plastic ice cream scoop?
What'd that cost? About $400.
This is about the sorriest group of people
I've seen in all my entire military career.
Your space flight's gonna be a brutal assault on your senses.
I'm here to give you a taste of that.
NASA's got some of the finest pilots in the world.
They're gonna be suckin' your eyes into the back of your heads.
Go easy on me, okay? It's my first time.
I just wanna seriously say
I have a small fear of flying.
I'm gonna twist ya.
- I'm gonna flip ya.
- What's the matter with you?
Frap your body till your bones hurt.
When you squeal, I'm just gonna go faster and harder.
No, take me down!
- How's the rest of the crew?
- Well, uh...
Sorry about the rib chunks all over your dashboard.
Don't forget: We gotta X-ray all these...
- If you had to say, who would you say?
- I don't know, Oscar.
- Who do you think you are?
- Han Solo.
No, if anybody's anybody, I'm Han.
And you're... You're Chewbacca.
Chewie? Have you even seen Star Wars?
All right, let's go.
Neil Armstrong, 1969, bouncing on the moon.
He's bouncing up there because there's less gravity up there than on Earth.
This will be similar to the asteroid, so watch it.
Something gets launched off that asteroid with enough force, it's gonna keep on going right into outer space.
What is the deal?
Is it just me, or is Watts really hot?
Yeah.
We have these new generation suits with directional accelerant thrusters.
- You won't bounce like Neil Armstrong.
- Yeah, think so?
- Bear!
- Yes?
- Do we have a problem?
- No.
'Cause I'm trying to describe to you how these D.A.T. s keep your ass on the ground.
So that if I were to kick you in the balls...
Ooh.
...and you don't know how to work them, what happens to you?
- I float away.
- Yeah.
And when do we start training for that?
Gentlemen, I'll give you 30 seconds to put your helmets on.
Then the oxygen will be sucked out of this vacuum, and you will know what it's like to be in space. Go!
Depressurize in 30 seconds.
Main valves have been activated.
Okay, gentlemen, so here's the flight plan.
Now let's keep the laughter to a minimum. I know this is not to scale.
Both shuttles will take off
Tuesday at 6:30 p. m.
Now 67 minutes later, you're gonna dock with the Russian space station to meet cosmonaut Andropov, who will refuel the shuttles with liquid O2.
That's your fuel. Then you'll release and take a 60-hour trip toward the moon.
Now we only have one shot of landing on this rock, and that's precisely when the asteroid passes by the moon.
You'll then use lunar gravity and burn your thrusters, slingshotting you around the moon, coming up behind the asteroid.
- You'll be upward of 11 Gs.
- Yeah, I remember this one.
It's where the coyote sat his ass down in a slingshot and he strapped himself to an Acme rocket.
- Is... Is that what we're doin' here?
- Rockhound.
No, no, really, because it didn't work out too well for the coyote, Harry.
Actually, we have a lot better rockets than the coyote.
Now when you've finished your Road Runner thrust move, you'll be moving at
22,500 miles per hour.
Coming around behind the asteroid, where we're hoping that the tail debris will be cleared by the moon's gravity.
And you'll land right here. That's it.
We got separate landing sites for each team.
Softest parts of the rock as we can figure.
At NASA, we don't take chances.
We double up on everything.
First team that hits 800 feet wins.
Now this rock is big, dense. It's got some gravity. You can walk around, but use your thrusters so you can work easier.
Okay, Mr. Truman, let's say that we actually do land on this.
What's it gonna be like up there?
Two hundred degrees in the sunlight.
Minus 200 in the shade.
Canyons of razor-sharp rock.
Unpredictable gravitational conditions.
Unexpected eruptions. Things like that.
Okay, so the scariest environment imaginable. Thanks.
That's all you gotta say, scariest environment imaginable.
Okay, so you drill, you drop the nuke and you leave.
Now here's the key.
You're gonna remote detonate the bomb before the asteroid passes this plane, zero barrier.
You do that, and the remaining pieces of rock should be deflected enough to pass right by us.
Now if the bomb explodes after zero barrier, game's over.
Apollo, this is Houston, fire your rockets!
Okay, your rockets are maximum.
- Oscar!
- Hey, Harry. Hey, how's it goin'?
- Have you seen Grace?
- Yeah, she's over in the hangar with A.J.
Harry, wait a second. Did you say
Grace? Okay, I thought you said Bear.
Will you marry me?
Grace is old enough to vote, Harry.
She's old enough to drink or get married if she wants to, get a divorce.
Let me tell you something, fellas.
When I get back, when we get this job done,
I will deal with this in my own way.
Come on, Harry. It's not like
I'm rootin' for A.J. here.
I'm just sayin',
Grace is not a little girl anymore.
Hey, Rock. Wait a minute. Let me get a pencil and a piece of paper.
I wanna jot down all your pearls of wisdom here.
Get serious, Harry. Come on. While we're off trottin' the globe, hunting mud,
Gracie grew up to become a full-blown hottie, you know?
- Harry, she is fully hot. She is...
- She's a babe.
Max, okay, you're talkin' about my little girl, all right?
I think I know who and what she is, okay?
Harry, all we're sayin' is, we're talkin' about a kid who's comin' into her own right now.
She's gettin' curious about her body, and she's exploring her sexuality.
You know what?
- Oscar.
- That's a natural thing.
You are about five minutes older than
Grace is. Why should I listen to you?
I know what it feels like to have your hormones pullin' you in just a thousand different directions.
No disrespect, man, but we all helped to raise her.
So, in part, we all feel like
- a bunch of daddies here.
- That's true.
I'll be damned if I worked all these years so my little girl can marry a roughneck.
She's better than that.
Better than all of us.
Harry, just sit back, relax. I'm gonna put on a free Armadillo driving clinic.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Harry!
Two shuttle teams.
A.J.'ll be running the drill team with Oscar, Bear and Noonan on the Independence.
I'll run the drill team on Freedom with Chick, Rockhound and Max.
Once we land, we'll have eight hours to get the job done.
In order to split this rock on the fault line, we're gonna have to drill to 800 feet.
Let's get our game faces on.
Now it's time for underwater simulation.
Come on. Let's keep it up.
Let's go. We're the younger team here.
We're the varsity team.
Take it to 11,000.
Okay, gentlemen, we're gonna trick
'em up. My computer will simulate a gas pocket at 625 feet and then hard iron ferrite at 635.
I'm gonna drill some more.
We're takin' her up.
- I'm givin' it more torque right now.
- All right, lookin' good, Bear.
Clamp it down.
Watch your time, Independence team.
Thanks, Harry. Would you mind lettin' me run my own team?
You're gonna blow the tranny.
- Slow it down, baby.
- Take it easy, Bear.
Just relax. She can handle it.
A.J., you're at 600 feet.
Your pipe is long. Let's back the R.P.M. s down to 8,000.
- We don't have time for 8,000!
- A.J., take it back down.
You're gonna snap the pipe.
I don't wanna blow this transmission.
- Damn it, 11,000.
- Slow it down, A.J.
Bear, come on. Get on our team for a little bit.
Oh, space cowboy.
- Harry, are you listenin' to this?
- Yeah, I'm listenin', Bear.
You don't work for Harry anymore, okay?
Out there, you gotta listen to me.
When we're on that rock, you gotta do what I say.
I'm throttling up to 11,000.
A.J., back it off.
You're gonna blow the transmission.
Hey, Harry, would you let me run my team, please?
R.P.M. s are at red line.
Bear, goddamn it,
I know what I'm doing.
Come on. She can handle this.
She'll be fine. Trust me.
- A.J., back down.
- The number one transmission is down.
Oh, son of a...
The computer's wrong, and you know that.
- We did the right thing.
- We're gonna restart the simulation.
If you wanna replace a member of the crew, now is the time.
I'll take care of this.
Get him out of the tank, Chick.
You wanna go home? Is that it?
- You wanna be fired?
- No, I don't.
My crew was doing the right thing.
- Your crew?
- Yeah.
Your crewjust blew the transmission, A.J.!
Listen, that NASA computer is just playin' it safe.
The machine you built, the rig, could do it.
Shut up. Just shut up! Shut your mouth!
Those men in that room have zero tolerance for showin' off, hot doggin', goin' by your gut instinct or you tryin' to be a hero, you got that?
- Say the words, A.J.!
- I got it!
I want my men to have tomorrow night off.
What do you mean "off"?
I mean, off. Out of here.
For at least ten hours.
Then we'll go to Kennedy.
Well, there's no possible way we can do that, Harry.
There's a potentially huge security risk.
What if they talk? What if they get hurt?
What if they're too burnt out to do the right thing?
What if they get up there, and they forget what they're fighting for?
You see what's goin' on.
These boys are ready to snap.
They didn't ask to be here.
They got pulled off the street.
For all we know, tomorrow night could be the last night they ever see Earth.
I don't think it's too much to ask to let 'em spend it with their families.
Listen, there's no possible way we can do that.
You got family, Colonel?
Two girls.
Wouldn't you like to spend tomorrow with your girls?
I'm not askin' ya. I'm tellin' ya.
Make this happen.
This is a pretty big loan.
Why don't you count the cash?
Nah, this looks like 100 grand to me.
I'm givin' you this at 60 percent.
I hope you know what you're doin', because I'll bust your head with a sledgehammer.
You'll get your money back.
You don't look too healthy.
You're not gonna die on me, are ya?
Let's just say, no more than you are.
Thanks, Vic.
Don't wanna close my eyes
I don't wanna fall asleep
'Cause I'd miss you, baby
And I don't wanna miss a thing
You know what I was thinkin'?
What?
I really don't think that the animal cracker qualifies as a cracker.
Why?
Well, 'cause it's sweet, which to me suggests cookie.
And, you know, putting cheese on something is sort of the defining characteristic of what makes a cracker a cracker.
I don't know why I thought of that.
I just...
Baby, you have such sweet pillow talk.
I got a little animal cracker,
Discovery Channel thing happenin' right here.
Watch the gazelle, as he grazes through the open plains.
Now look, as the cheetah approaches.
Watch, as he stalks his prey.
Now, the gazelle's a little spooked, and he could head north to the ample sustenance provided by the mountainous peaks above.
He could go south.
The gazelle now faces man's most perilous question:
North...
Or south?
Way down under.
Tune in next week.
Baby, do you think it's possible that anyone else in the world is doing this very same thing at this very same moment?
I hope so.
Otherwise, what the hell are we tryin' to save?
Don't wanna close my eyes
I don't wanna fall asleep
'Cause I'd miss you, baby
And I don't wanna miss a thing
Hey.
What are you doing here?
I was just passin' by on the, uh...
I came...
Who's he?
That man's a salesman.
Would you go inside?
Thank you.
He got big.
You can't come around like this.
The court says you can't.
It confuses him.
No, I know. I just...
I wanted to say that I'm sorry about everything.
I got somethin' comin' up.
It's somethin' kinda big.
You just might be proud of me.
Would you do somethin' for me?
Would you just give him this?
You don't have to... You don't have to tell him who it's from. Just...
Everybody talkin' about what it is, what it ain't
Kiss on the devil and you piss off a saint
But it can't be love if you don't have to crawl
You say you only love him but you got to have it all
Hey, Noonan, you need ten grand?
We gotta put these girls through college.
I love this astronaut stuff.
Good work, if you can get it.
Yeah, I'm just in town doin' a little astronaut training.
Ooh! Astronauta.
Ah, si. I'm a mission specialist.
Yes, and what's that mean?
I don't know.
Hey! Who the hell do you think you guys are?
You're hoggin' all the action.
Hey, pinhead.
Why don't you go find your own party?
Why don't you spread the wealth, pal?
Here. Why don't you go buy yourself a neck?
Hey, Mr. Clean!
Call NASA! They'll confirm it!
We're astronauts!
Get over there. Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, we're astronauts!
- Yeah, we're all astronauts.
You are so messing with national security right now, man.
You are fired tomorrow morning.
I'm telling ya.
I'll get the C.I.A. and the F.B.I.
You'll be workin' security at Toys 'R' Us.
- Oh, oh, baby, no, no. No, no!
- Bye-bye, little astronaut.
Oh, don't leave, baby. No, no, no.
See, I'm goin' into space, and I'm not comin' back.
It's coming in at 30,000 miles an hour!
Give me a projected impact.
East Asia, 11 minutes.
- We're gonna have to warn...
- Warn who? The entire South Pacific?
So the whole world knows.
Tell me you've never let anybody down before.
I never quit yet. How's that?
I guess that'll have to do.
You know somethin'?
I still remember the first, middle and last name of every guy that qualified for the astronaut program first year I was here. Thanks.
I went into the engineering program.
Kinda had to.
But boy, I wanted to go up there.
I wanted to be one of those guys with a mission patch on my arm.
I tell you, I'd be on that shuttle with you, Harry, if I could.
You don't want to be up in that shuttle any more than I do.
Good luck in Florida tomorrow.
The death of 50,000 people in Shanghai yesterday has rattled...
A French satellite has tracked an object in space...
Sources are estimating that the tidal wave was five...
This is CNN, live in Florida.
We have just learned that NASA is on a full-scale military alert.
They're calling this a global killer.
The government has been very tight-lipped throughout this...
The Pentagon is getting involved at this point with some kind of a project involving NASA and perhaps a shuttle mission...
Senior Pentagon officials refused comment, adding fuel to the speculation that there could be a very serious problem.
We have a special team of astronauts that arrived in Florida this evening.
NASA's in emergency launch preparation in cooperation with Russian, Japanese and French space agencies on the most massive joint space venture in history.
Gracie?
Got your note.
What're you doin' out here, honey?
Um, just thinkin'.
- Yeah.
- I, um, want to apologize to you for...
Oh, no, Grace, stop.
You don't have to apologize at all.
I... I...
I shouldn't have dragged you around on all those oil rigs.
I just...
I don't think that I did the right thing with you.
You're wrong. I love my life.
I love everything about my life.
And I don't blame you for my mother leaving.
She left us both.
And I love you.
And don't talk like you're not comin' back.
Promise me that you'll come back.
Okay.
Say, "I promise. "
I promise, Grace.
It's gonna be all right, Grace.
If it's not too much trouble, can you please bring my fiancée home with you?
Oh, Jesus.
The president will be addressing the nation and all of you personally within the hour.
Astronauts.
I'll see you in a couple days, honey.
All my bags are packed
I'm ready to go
I'm standin' here outside your door
I hate to wake you up
To say good-bye
So kiss me and smile for me
Let me know you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go
'Cause I'm leavin'
On a jet plane
Don't know when I'll be back again
Leavin' on a jet plane
I don't know when I'll be back again
Leavin' on a jet plane
I don't know when I'll be back again
Leavin' on a jet plane
Don't know when I'll be back again
So, Truman, this is who you found to save the planet.
- Frost, you good to go?
- Mm-hmm. One... One sec.
Leavin' on a jet plane
That boy don't take anything seriously.
Yeah. Reminds me of a guy
I used to know.
Leavin' on a jet plane
I don't know when I'll be back again
I'm marrying you.
Bet your ass you are.
Leavin' on a jet plane
I don't know when I'll be back again
I address you tonight, not as the President of the United States, not as the leader of a country, but as a citizen of humanity.
WE are faced with the very gravest of challenges.
The Bible calls this day
Armageddon, the end of all things.
And yet, for the first time, in the history of the planet, a species has the technology to prevent its own extinction.
All of you praying with us need to know that everything that can be done to prevent this disaster is being called into service.
The human thirst for excellence, knowledge, every step up the ladder of science, every adventurous reach into space, all of our combined modern technologies and imaginations, even the wars that we've fought, have provided us the tools... to wage this terrible battle.
Through all the chaos that is our history, through all of the wrongs and the discord, through all of the pain and suffering, through all of our times, there is one thing that has nourished our souls...
Mom, that salesman's on TV.
...and elevated our species above its origins, and that is our courage.
Dreams of an entire planet are focused tonight on those 14 brave souls traveling into the heavens.
That man's not a salesman.
That's your daddy.
And may we all, citizens the world over, see these events through.
Godspeed and good luck to you.
Freedom crew. Independence crew.
How ya feelin'?
Uh, good, you know.
I mean, considering I've never been this scared in my entire life.
I... You know...
Listen. Once you get up there, you're gonna be on your own.
If anything should happen,
I just wanted to...
I know, Harry.
I'll, uh, try not to disappoint you.
Take care of yourself, kid.
Freedom's on the bridge.
Attention in the firing room.
Oxidizer loading is complete.
Independence on the bridge.
Attention all personnel.
We are T minus two hours to the program goal.
- Hey, Harry.
- Yeah, Rock?
You know, we're sittin' on four million pounds of fuel, one nuclear weapon and a thing that has
270,000 moving parts built by the lowest bidder.
Makes you feel good, doesn't it?
Yeah.
- How ya doin', Oscar?
- Great.
I got that excited, scared feelin', like 98 percent excited,
2 percent scared.
Maybe more. It could be 2...
It could be 98 percent scared,
2 percent excited.
But that's what makes it so intense, is it's so confused.
I can't really figure it out.
Will you make mine really tight,
'cause I don't want to fall out?
I mean, almost to the point of cutting off circulation.
It must be a comfort to know that if the space program goes under, you can always get a job at Helga's House of Pain, huh?
All right. Flight directors on with the go/no-go for launch.
- Retro.
- Go flight.
- Booster.
- Go flight.
- Ecos.
- Go flight.
- Trajectory.

- CAPCOM Independence.
- Go flight.
All right, ladies and gentlemen, it's pucker time.
Independence and Freedom, this is Kennedy firing room.
We're T minus one minute.
All crew members, close and lock your visors.
Independence, this is launch control.
Be advised, we're in a smooth count.
T minus 31.
You're go for auto-sequence start.
P.L.T.s, perform your A.P.U. pre-start.
Okay, gentlemen, you're our warriors up there.
God be with you.
You're already heroes.
Just sit back and enjoy the ride.
We're T minus 20 seconds.
Ten. Nine. Eight. Seven.
Four. Three. Two. One.
We have main engine start.
- We have booster ignition.
- We're going.
And liftoff.
Freedom, this is flight deck.
Roger, Freedom. You're looking good.
We have go for Independence.
Three. Two. One.
Independence, we have booster ignition.
We have liftoff.
We are cooking, Houston.
Houston, the tower is clear.
They're all yours.
Heads up, everybody. They're ours now.
All engines are go.
Keep a sharp eye out on both of 'em.
Start roll maneuver.
Two good roll programs.
- One down.
- Independence, we have max cue.
Roger, Control. We are a max cue.
S.R.B. sep...
We are single-engine, press, demi-go.
Copy, press, demi-go.
Houston, this is a kick-ass ride!
Freedom, this is Houston.
Main engine cut out on schedule. Out.
Freedom, stats are good.
Independence, telemetry is up and running.
Oh, my God.
This is space! Course, we're just in the beginning part of space.
We... We haven't gotten to outer space yet.
Roger, Houston. We have a visual on the Russian space station.
Initiating retro burn.
Gentlemen, remember the Russian space station has been up there for 11 years.
Most of us don't have cars that old.
Now, the cosmonaut on board has been on that tin can for 18 months, alone.
So don't be surprised if he's a little... off.
Independence, we're gonna put you...
All right, crew.
Let's exit these flight suits.
Hello.
This is Russian space station.
Can you hear me?
We copy, Russian space station.
This is Houston.
I'm ready to fire my thrusters any time.
- Stand by.
- Okay. I'm not going anywhere.
We have a go.
Initiate gravitational spin.
You are maxed at 40-percent spin.
Okay, Houston.
I can feel I'm having gravity.
All right, gentlemen.
We're gonna dock in a minute.
Now, the Russian space station
- has fired her rockets...
- Whee!
...to simulate gravity and let us work faster.
It's gonna make you queasy, so prepare yourself.
Well, it's about time.
I haven't thrown up in about an hour.
Initiating first phase of docking procedure.
- Switching to manual.
- Manual override.
One foot per second. Let's take this slow and do it right, folks.
Twenty feet.
Ten feet.
Looking good on radar.
Five feet.
Locks are engaged. Fuel teams, let's go.
Freedom, telemetry is looking good.
We have soft dock.
Fuel teams, prepare to unload.
All right, gentlemen, watch your heads.
Let's go, Independence.
Colonel.
Where is he? Anybody home?
Welcome, everybody!
I am not gas station.
This is sophisticated laboratory.
I'm in charge.
So do not be touching anything.
- I need one... I need you.
- Go with him.
I need you. Hurry up. Hurry up.
Come on. Come on.
It's very important you watch the fuel gauge, okay?
Put on cold suit.
- Countdown clock will hold at...
- Copy that, Houston.
Prepping for fuel transfer.
Countdown clock will hold at T minus 20 minutes and...
Fuel pod is down there.
It's down here, huh? Great.
Okay, let's connect these fuel lines.
Freedom on the left,
Independence on the right.
All right. We're goin' left here.
To the right is fuel gauge.
You watch the fuel gauge.
One fifty, okay. One sixty, okay.
Two hundred, bad disaster for space station.
So if you watch 200, you call for Lev, on, and you see here number one. Off.
You ask for Lev. And you pull this down, all the way down.
What's Lev?
I am Lev Andropov, colonel of Russian space agency.
In Russia I'm a very big man.
We're ready to transfer.
I'm coming. No problem.
You. You. You there!
- Hard locked.
- Ready for transfusion!
Fuel is pumping.
Hey, Lev, the, uh...
The... The pressure's climbing.
Still, we're on fuel transference.
Don't touch my uncle. You know?
He's a genius of my family.
Lev! Can anybody hear me?
Guys? Hello, guys!
He used to work for a big bomb factory.
He used to make the tip of the bomb, the thing that finds, uh, New York or Washington, you know?
Ooh.
Check your hoses.
We got some thermal variation.
Stamper, let's look at the couplings, back on the shuttle.
Okay. Shut down. Uh...
Uh... Guys!
What's that noise?
Oh, no! God!
What is it?
Leak! Leak!
Get your men back to the shuttle! Go!
Go! Hurry up! Get out of there!
You know, this really smarts!
Pull lever!
This is the lever!
Colonel, we must get him out of there!
A.J., come on out!
Hurry! Hurry!
Emergency break away!
We got a fire in the fuel pod!
- Come on!
- Come on!
Get in here! A.J.'s stuck in the fuel pod!
We're losing it!
Control, this is Independence.
I am seeing vibration...
Malloy, talk to me!
Not good.
We got sparks and fire in the fuel pod.
Independence, blow those locks and get outta there now!
Dump the hoses now! We're going!
What happened?
Let me shut off the O2 feed!
Harry, it's burnin' up!
Damn! Max, Rock, get in here!
Get down there and crack these pipes over here!
Harry, it's burnin' up!
We're goin' back for the other team!
Switch on the personnel locators.
Trackin' A.J. He's climbin'.
- No!
- Go! Go!
It's too late! Get back to the shuttle!
This thing's gonna blow!
No!
Colonel, we gotta move now!
Come on! Close the hatch!
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
We got a man in there!
- Open that door, and we'll all die!
- Fuel leak!
Evac now! Let's go! Let's go!
Come on back! No, wait!
The door is broken!
No!
They got the fire sealed in the fuel pod.
They locked it down.
Tracking men to the shuttle.
They've still got two men trapped in there!
Keep running!
The shuttle's another 75 feet!
Where's the rest of the team?
Where's A.J.?
- A.J.'s gone!
- We're not leavin' without A.J.!
He's gone! It's too late!
Come on! This way is our only chance!
So it's minus hundred!
Very cold. Hold breath, or lung freezes!
Get back to the shuttle!
And lock that door!
It's on fire! It's on fire, Harry!
- It's them or all of us!
- It's on fire.
- Full thrust.
- We're gonna get hit.
Lev! Lev, the door's gonna blow!
No!
We're going! It's gonna blow!
A.J.'s still in there!
Blow the locks. No, the bolts!
We've gotta...
I think we're almost there!
Flight, Independence does not have A.J.
They're gonna close the door without him.
Tracking.
They're 75 feet from the shuttle.
Just tell 'em to air lock the door and go!
Dog the hatch now!
Close it!
Ho...
Colonel! That thing's comin' right for...
We got to move!
Hurry up! There's the shuttle door!
Fire's coming at us! Close the door now!
Go! Go! Go!
Freedom, the Independence crew is on board and accounted for.
We're even heavy one cosmonaut.
They got 90 percent of their fuel.
Pretty intense, huh?
That's why I told you, "Touch nothing. "
But you're bunch of cowboys.
So while the consciousness of the planet is unified, focused on the NASA mission taking place right now in the vast ocean of space, we're now in the final hours of the mission, as the Freedom and Independence prepare to slingshot around the moon.
Morning, guys.
It's time to suit up, I guess.
Uh, we got a big day.
Eighteen seconds to radio interrupt.
Booster sequence confirmed.
This is Houston.
Roger that, Freedom. We copy
Shuttles are ready for the burn around the moon.
Radio contact terminated. We're out.
Nine and a half Gs for 11 minutes.
I'd start praying about right now.
So this is the part where we're supposed to just hold on real tight and, uh, hope we don't die.
Stand by for lunar roll.
High inclination. Lunar orbit.
You boys got those wills filled out correctly?
All right, men, this is what we trained for.
Nowjust suck it up!
On the mark. Five. Four.
Three. Two. One.
Is this supposed to be like this?
Don't worry. This is normal.
How would you know?
- Fourteen thousand miles an hour.
- Four Gs.
- Ahh!
- How long does this last?
Six Gs.
Fifteen thousand.
- Really heavy, man!
- This isn't normal.
What do you mean, "this isn't normal"?
This is way worse!
Eight Gs. Hang tight!
We're not gonna make it!
Oh, we're gonna die!
Twelve minutes.
Flight, we still got nothin' here.
This is too fast!
Ten Gs!
We're maxed at 22,500!
We have acquisition of signal from Independence and Freedom.
We're in, guys.
All right. Welcome back, team.
We have visual of the target, Houston.
You see that?
Wow.
Come in, Independence.
Houston, you gotta see this to believe it.
Okay, team, let's take 'em in.
Okay, Quincy, how much tail debris do we have?
Freedom, turn on FOD radar.
FOD radar on.
Everybody, hang on.
This could get a little rough.
Engaging evasive radar.
Hold on!
Goddamn! We got debris!
We're dumping auxiliary boosters.
- Houston, do you read me?
- We got debris!
We're goin' in! We're comin' in hot!
Independence, try to maintain your present heading.
You've got a target L.Z.
There's too much debris!
We gotta peel off!
Negative!
We're hit!
Mayday, mayday!
I've lost main thrusters.
Get 'em back up!
Mayday, Houston, mayday!
We've lost R.C.S. thrusters!
Mayday, Freedom, mayday!
We are out of control!
We are going down!
Do you read me?
Freedom, we are going down!
We're gonna hit!
Everybody, go to your own life support!
Lock yourself in the cargo bay!
We are going down!
Houston! Houston, we are going down!
We have lost control!
I can't get it on!
Good luck, Freedom.
Oh, my God, this is it.
Sharp, what the hell is that?
Is that the Independence?
Houston, Independence is a dead stick.
They're not gonna make it.
Houston,
Independence has gone down.
When I touch this baby down, full reverse thrust.
- Fires on your right, Sharp!
- Reversing the thrusters!
Hang tight! Hang tight!
Houston, we overshot our landing field.
We overshot our landing field.
Oh, no!
God!
Initiate system light system check.
Make sure we can still get off this rock.
Our electrical system is screwed.
I'm going to back-up.
Fuel seals check. Engine seals check.
- Oh, God. Oh!
- Pressure seals check.
Anyone hurt?
Where's...
Where's the other shuttle?
What happened to the other shuttle?
Independence is off the grid.
"Off the grid"?
What are you, a freakin' cyborg?
What does that mean?
Hey, you saw it yourself, right?
They're gone.
Come in, Freedom. This is
CAPCOM Houston. Freedom, come in.
This is CAPCOM Houston.
Come in, Freedom.
- God!
- Let's just ask God to take care of our friends.
May they rest in peace.
Amen.
We got eight hours.
Let's get this job done and go home.
Nothin'.
Come on, Watts, Sharp, somebody.
This is CAPCOM Houston.
Come in, Freedom. Freedom, come in.
This is CAPCOM Houston.
Maybe you shouldn't be here.
I don't have anywhere else to go.
Freedom, come in.
This is CAPCOM Houston.
All right, let's get the tools unpacked and fire up the Armadillo.
We're not getting a damn thing on the inertial nav system.
- I know where we are.
- Please step away.
Radio signal's dead.
I'm flipping the backup generator.
Radio signal's gonna be cut in half till we get main power back.
We're in segment 202, lateral grid 9, site 15H-32, give or take a few yards.
Captain America here blew the landing by 26 miles.
How the hell do you know that?
Because I'm a genius.
The gauges will not read.
They're all peaked, like we're plugged into some magnetic field.
Well, who on this spaceship wants to know why?
- By all means.
- The reason we were shooting for grid 8 is because thermographics indicated that grid 9 was compressed iron ferrite.
Which means that you landed us on a goddamn iron plate.
All right. Well, you heard the man.
Let's wheel out the remote satellite link.
We need that radio.
Oh, God, please tell me we still got one of 'em.
Independence has flat-lined.
Oscar! Oscar!
Oh, God!
Hello! Anyone! Is anyone else alive?
Somebody, help me!
A.J.!
Where are you?
I'm here.
Lev, there's no one else.
There's no one else.
I know.
Oh, man.
Bear, where are you?
A.J.? A.J.?
I'm in the shuttle, man.
Are you all right?
I'm so glad to see you, man.
I never thought I'd be so happy to see your ugly face.
Houston, do you read? This is Freedom.
Check your thrusters.
Houston, do you copy?
Is everyone good to go?
Wow.
Down here! In the valley!
This place is like
Dr. Seuss's worst nightmare.
Let's get the remote satellite.
We'll get better reception up there.
Bring Max down.
Watch yourself through here, Max.
There're a couple big fissures.
To the left!
Bring it to the left!
Rockhound, you come on down here and take some readings down in the flat spot.
Iron ferrite.
I have fire.
Watts, I'm comin' back.
Stand by.
Mostly iron, Rockhound.
God, I hate knowing everything.
We couldn't have picked a worse spot to drill.
Well, I can pretty much guarantee it's not gonna be thicker than 50 feet.
- How do you figure that?
- 'Cause if it is, we're screwed.
- Max, you good?
- Yeah. Just makin' hole.
Turn it around.
Friggin' outer space.
It's good.
All right. We're in. Another light.
We're cuttin' through pretty good.
There's some stuff in here
I ain't never seen.
All right, let's punch it down!
- Hey, Harry, did you see that?
- Yeah, Max, I see it. I see it. What is it?
We lost the bite in the bit.
All right. Back it off. Back it off.
Goddamn it!
Sounds like we twisted a shank.
Back it out of there, Max.
Good. Good. Hold 'er there.
Wow, this is a goddamn Greek tragedy.
We've all seen broken drill heads before.
Not after ten feet.
- I never seen one.
- Well, now you've seen one.
- What do you want?
- Unpack the Judge.
Bear, Lev.
We're only three astronauts left now.
We're not astronauts.
We're oil drillers.
We're not even supposed to be here.
What? You're not astronaut?
- I'm getting us outta here. Get in.
- Why?
Just get in the Armadillo. I have an idea.
Houston, this is Freedom. Do you copy?
Houston, do you copy?
Freedom shuttle has...
We're gettin' some scattered video feeds here.
Houston, this is Freedom.
Do you copy?
- Thank God we have you, Freedom.
- Freedom, this is Houston. Go ahead.
- Don't lose 'em, Malloy.
- Sharp, I'm getting something.
Houston, this is Freedom.
- We have landed safely.
- Where are they?
We are at site coordinates approximately 15H-32...
Okay, I want to know everything we can about that location.
- Got it.
- Get it before we lose 'em.
We're also having electric and antenna difficulties.
Walter, get Mechanical on that.
But we have commenced drilling.
Stevens, we're losin' him.
Bring it up on four. On four.
- Come on.
- Shuttle flight capability not yet known.
- Bump the signal.
- Bumping.
Houston. Houston.
We lost 'em. Get 'em back.
Gruber, we need that hookup.
Show you how we do things where I come from.
Hold on!
Seat it.
All right, get ready. Max, thread it.
Guys, the clock is tickin'.
Let's go, go, go, go, go!
All right! Good! Crank it loose!
Keep it at 25.
Let's kick a little asteroid butt!
All right, Chick. Give me more torque on the turbine, huh?
Max, I need some more power down here!
- All right, boss.
- Throw it in fourth, then drop the hammer.
Let's drill through this turd.
Come on, boys.
We gotta hop. We're fallin' behind.
Dig, dig, dig. Chew this iron bitch up.
- Chick, the tranny's stuck.
- Harry!
What is it?
Chick, come on! Help!
- Release the clutch!
- Pull it up!
Okay. Well, this thing's not movin'.
No, no, no! Shut it down! Shut it...
This is not workin' out, Harry.
- Oh, are you all right?
- Oh, blew the tranny. Blew the tranny.
Come on, God.
Just a little help. That's all I'm askin'.
I think we're close enough.
He might've heard ya.
Here's the bad news.
Before the asteroid passed the moon, her rotation was stable at 32 degrees on an x axis.
But now look at this.
The lunar gravity's put her in a spin.
She's tumbling on all three axes.
This wasn't expected, sir.
- What does this do for communications?
- Not good.
We'll have definite contact with the shuttle for only seven more minutes.
- After that it's radio darkness.
- For how long?
And after seven minutes, we may never hear from them again.
But we're trying to bounce a signal off a Russian military satellite, reestablish contact that way.
If we lose the shuttle com, when do we lose the ability to remote detonate that nuke?
The weapon remote receives a signal from a Milstar satellite.
Higher orbit, more powerful transmitter.
If we've got the shuttle for seven minutes, we can remote detonate for an additional five.
What he's trying to say, General, is that, uh, in 12 minutes' time, you may lose the ability to detonate the nuke... permanently.
I've got to inform the president.
Just want to make sure you know we're stuck on an asteroid.
- Do you know what you're doing now?
- No, no.
You know what? I have no idea what I'm doing. I have no idea.
This button,
I don't know what that does, okay?
All I know is that we just crashed back there,
I lost two of my friends, we're 25 miles from Harry's shuttle.
We don't know if he's alive.
We don't know if he can fly.
All I know is, there's a beep on this thing and I'm trying to get us there.
Let's get it unpacked.
What's up?
We're drilling through some kind of metal I've never seen before.
It's fried two of our drill bits, and now we blew our first transmission.
So how deep are we?
We could use your help with the transmission, Colonel.
I have an assessment report due now.
We're supposed to be at 200 feet.
- So how deep are we?
- Not as deep as we'll be when you quit askin' me these questions and help us load this transmission on.
What is our current depth?
Our current depth is not important, Colonel.
I'll decide what's important.
We've got 800 feet to drill.
You've had two and a half hours.
Where are we?
We're at 57 feet.
Now, if you're not too busy, maybe you can give us a hand with this transmission.
Colonel Sharp!
Get this strapped up. I'll be right back.
Colonel Sharp!
All right. I'm coming through.
We have contact. Over.
That's as clear as it's gonna get.
Houston, this is Freedom. Do you copy?
Working at a remote satellite link at this moment.
- Transmission change.
- Colonel!
Twenty minutes.
Puts drilling final at ten hours.
Please advise. That's four hours past the zero barrier. Please advise.
What the hell is this? "Zero depth"?
And where'd this come from?
Who are you talkin' to? Is that Truman?
Lemme have that phone.
Gimme the phone.
Truman! Look, this is what happens when you drill.
We cannot use your "U.S. Air Force
Personnel Only" drill time card.
- Who wrote this thing, by the way?
- We're losing coms again.
Look. Is he getting this?
Does he hear me or...
- What's wrong with this?
- The com's down.
What do you mean, "the com's down"?
What do I mean?
I mean we've lost
- communication to mission control.
- Fine.
Let's go back to the cargo bay and get the transmission...
Harry, guess what. You had your shot.
You didn't do it. You understand me?
- You can't...
- Why don't you stay here...
Write a report, why don't ya?
That'll be...
My men and I will go and get this hole dug!
You and your men are the biggest mistake in the history of NASA.
- We've lost communication.
- Oh, God.
- We're not lookin' too good right now.
- No shit.
We gotta get that radio back up.
Mr. President, it's time to make a decision.
We can remote detonate the bomb for only another five minutes.
Yes? Kimsey here. Yes, Mr. President.
Yes, we saw that, too, sir.
But maybe we should wait until they...
Dan, get them out of there.
- Evac right now.
- What's goin' on here?
I've been ordered to override the system.
Well, what is this?
Secondary protocol.
But they haven't drilled the damn hole yet!
The president's advisors feel that the drilling isn't working.
And we've lost radio contact, maybe for good.
We've only got a few minutes left of guaranteed ability to remote detonate that nuke.
If we don't do it now we could lose control, and we may never get it back.
Well, you tell the president that he better fire his so-called advisors.
If you detonate that nuke on the surface, we waste a perfectly good bomb, and we have one chance to save this planet!
I need that radio.
Gruber, give me everything you got now!
Roger that.
Yes, Mr. President,
I understand that completely, but my point is very, very simple.
And I think you need to trust me on this because I know something about it.
I guarantee you, if you do this, you kill us all.
Yes, sir.
General, he wants you.
This is Kimsey. Yes, sir.
I understand.
The orders are to remote detonate in 30 seconds.
You have not told them yet!
That is my father up there!
This is one order you shouldn't follow, and you fucking know it!
Let her go. Let her go!
Your key, sir.
God be with them.
Slow it down.
Harry, the clock on that nine-foot nuclear weapon is ticking.
Oh, my God! Sharp! Get back here now!
What?
Get the shuttle ready to evac now!
It just came on all by itself.
- What the hell's happening?
- Secondary protocol.
- What's that? What?
- Secondary protocol.
- What does that mean?
- What the hell's secondary protocol?
They're detonating this thing from Earth.
What do you mean, detonating?
- We haven't even drilled the hole yet!
- We'll drop it in the hole.
- What're you talkin' about?
- The hole?
Get your helmets on now!
- Oh, no, no. How... How you turn it off?
- I got two men out on that rock!
I got a man out there, too.
We gotta evac now.
Max, Rockhound, get back to the shuttle, double-time!
- They could be on their way here.
- They're not on their way here.
They would've talked to us by now.
We would've seen them.
- Watts, air lock the cockpit now!
- I copy you.
- Max, Rockhound!
- Hey, wait a minute!
How do you turn this thing off?
- Harry, do you copy?
- Something's wrong.
Yeah, it's all wrong, man.
We shouldn't even be up here.
I know. Let's go back to the ship!
I'm not leavin' without my men, Sharp.
We've got two and a half minutes to drop it and get off this rock.
If they're not back by the time we finish, we leave without 'em.
Okay, let's simplify this.
Let's just turn the bomb off right now.
If we don't put this bomb down in a hole 800 feet onto a fault line, all you're gonna have is a real expensive fireworks show.
This is turnin' into a surrealistic nightmare here.
Watsler, are you listening? It's Truman.
Okay, listen to me carefully.
I want you to kill it. Kill the uplink.
Give us the time, Sharp.
Shut this bomb down now!
- It's not my call.
- Then whose call is it?
An order to detonate can only come from the president.
- The president's not here!
- Let's just turn it off now.
You've gotta give us more time!
I'm telling you to shut this bomb down now!
And I'm telling you it's not my call!
Well, guess what.
I just made the call for you.
Harry!
Don't. You could set it off.
Oh, man.
What're you doin' with a gun in space?
Come on, come on.
We gotta stop that bomb right now.
Kill the uplink.
This thing is gonna blow.
- We gotta get it off the ship.
- Easy.
Stand down, Sergeant.
Shut this bomb down and let us finish our job the right way.
I'm under orders to protect a surface detonation.
I'm gonna give you three seconds to shut this bomb down, and then I'm gonna make you shoot me.
Hurry, Watsler. For Christ's sake, hurry.
What happened?
Sir, the override... It's been overridden.
I bought us a couple of minutes, so get that radio workin', okay?
Hurry, hurry!
Bring me all the way up here just to blow me and my friends up? Is that it?
- Listen...
- Shut up!
Shut up, Colonel. I'm talking now.
It could start again.
It might've been a warning.
Uh-oh.
That's why you are gonna dismantle this bomb.
All right. What'd we miss?
- Do it again.
- Go.
Keep tryin'.
Sir, I need you to cease and desist.
I need your terminal... Now.
- They're reactivating the bomb.
- Comin' back on-line, sir.
Oh, geez. Here we go again.
What're you doin' up here? And why did you even bother to make the trip?
To do the right thing, to see that it's done.
For God's sakes, think about what you're doin'.
Why are you listenin' to someone that's 100,000 miles away?
We're here.
Nobody down there can help us.
So if we don't get this job done, then everybody's gone.
One minute.
I've been drillin' holes in the earth for 30 years.
And I have never, never missed a depth that I have aimed for.
And by God, I am not gonna miss this one. I will make 800 feet.
Forty-two seconds.
But I can't do it alone, Colonel.
I need your help.
You swear on your daughter's life, on my family's, that you can hit that mark?
I will make 800 feet.
I swear to God, I will.
Then let's turn this bomb off.
Steady. Take it back.
That's what you'll have to do.
Get 'em off backwards.
Rainbow track? Under...
- Under one? Under... Okay.
- All of 'em. All of 'em.
- Okay. Are we free of static?
- Oh, do a good job. Do a good job.
- Steady. Steady.
- Good job. All right. All right.
Go! Go! Go! Red wire "A."
Ready? And...
Now. Come on! Come on!
Come on! Come on!
Negative "B."
- Ready, and now.
- Do a good job. Do a good job.
Track flipped. Hot's in.
- It better be. Go.
- Red or blue?
Re...
Blue.
Good job!
Oh, God, it sucks up here.
Sir, the clock has stopped at three seconds.
What?
Have we lost complete radio contact?
I got some magic happening.
We're bouncing off Russian and French satellites.
- It may have a faint signal.
- Houston? Houston, do you copy?
Go ahead, Freedom.
Houston, you have a problem...
Problem.
See, I promised my little girl that I'd be comin' home.
Now, I don't know what you people are doin' down there, but we got a hole to dig up there.
Go, go, go, go! Come on.
We got work to do.
Okay, guys. All go, no quit.
How ya doin' down there? Good?
Okay, got the tranny.
We're back in business.
Hey, you guys should take a break and come up and see this.
Wow. Got a great view of the Earth from here.
Too bad we'll never set foot on her again.
- Lev, do you see anything?
- No.
Well, keep goin'. I'm not givin' up.
Hold up here, Bear.
- Oh, boy.
- This is great.
We just happen to run into the Grand Canyon on the asteroid?
I told you, you took a wrong way, a wrong road.
What... What road?
Do you see any roads around here?
You know what? I do not have much pleasure being near God's ear.
But you think this is looking good, or what?
Lev, why don't you just do humanity a favor and just shut the hell up?
Have you ever heard of Evel Knievel?
No, I never saw Star Wars.
All right. Doin' a good job.
- Give me a depth reading, Max.
- We're 150 feet, Harry.
Yee-ha!
Ride 'em, cowboy!
Yippee-kai-yo, kai-yay!
Get off the nuclear warhead.
I was doin' that guy from that movie, you know, Slim Pickens, where he rides it all the way in, the nuclear warhead.
- Now.
- Oh, you didn't see that one, huh?
We got 700 feet of hole to dig,
Rockhound.
All right. Just... Just wanted to feel the power between my legs, brother.
Hey, Sharp.
No nukes!
No nukes! No nukes!
You got any more bullets in that gun, Sharp?
What did Watts tell you, Bear?
If she kicked you in the balls,
- you'd keep floating.
- Yeah.
We turn the thrusters off, we jump this thing, we float right over it.
Go over it again, Lev.
Throw the jet thrusters off exactly when we jump.
- Okay.
- And then we're gonna put them on, and we gonna go down nice and slow.
- That's it. That's it, baby. That's it.
- Is this gonna work?
- I don't know.
- Lev, you know what, just lie to me.
Let's say 50-50... No. More like, uh...
Like 70-30 or 80-20.
But you know what?
If it works, the two of you gonna be heroes, just like me.
Screw it.
We're jumpin' over this canyon.
Just for the record, this is a very bad idea!
Wait for the edge.
- Don't hit it till we get there.
- I'm waiting.
Three.
Two. One!
- Yes! It's working!
- It's working!
Oh, my God!
I'm a genius! Wait a minute.
- We got some rocks!
- Go left! Go left!
Lev, Lev, I can't do anything!
Oh, okay, okay, we're floating into outer space.
- Check main switch.
- Uh, this could be a little bit of a problem.
- Thrusters on... Now!
- All right, turn 'em on.
- What's wrong?
- I... I don't know.
The... The thrusters not working.
I hate this machine!
I thought you had this planned!
- What're we supposed to do?
- Be quiet! I must think!
- I'm stepping outside.
- You're... You're going outside?
I am the only certified astronaut, and I'm saving your American ass!
Yes. You'll listen to him. Right.
Hurry up, Lev, because we're about a mile off the asteroid!
Just a second. The fuel line is iced up.
- I think maybe workin' now.
- No, Lev, it's not working!
I'm sorry, A.J., I was way off the odds.
We're gettin' higher, man.
Look out! The rocks! Rocks are coming!
Hold on!
- Pull the thrusters!
- Lev, look out!
- We lost Lev.
- A.J.!
A.J., the thrusters!
Let's get Lev back!
Lev, hold on! We're comin' in!
Thank You, Jesus. Thank You, Lord.
Thank You. Thank You, thank You, thank You, thank You.
Lev!
- Now I'm really a Russian hero!
- I told you!
- I know!
- I knew this would work!
- Good odds, you know?
- Come on, Lev.
- Get in here. We gotta go.
- Yah!
Rockhound, keep on that transmission.
- Tranny looks good, Harry.
- All right. Take it outta there.
Lock it down, Chick.
Nice.
How come we didn't get any training on this thing?
Whoa. Very cool. I could take out this asteroid single-handedly.
Okay, boys, give it a rest.
I'll take it from here.
- What the hell is that?
- It's Rockhound.
Whoa. This is so much fun, it's freaky.
Rockhound!
Whoa, watch your heads. Sorry, Harry.
- Outta my way, boys!
- Rockhound!
Meet your maker, asteroid!
What the hell's the matter with you,
Rockhound?
- Goddamn!
- This is insane.
- Have you lost your mind?
- No.
He's got space dementia.
Harry, you want to watch your man.
Max, downshift and put it in reverse.
We gotta get that pipe outta there.
Uh-oh.
- What's happening?
- The ground's cracking!
Earthquake!
Quick, shut it off!
- Shut it off! Shut it off now!
- We're gonna have a blowout!
- We hit a gas pocket!
- We got pressure out the ass!
Max, get your helmet on!
Max, she's gonna blow!
- Aah! Oh, Jesus, I'm cooking!
- Max, get outta there!
This is it! Harry!
I'm bailing!
Max!
Good-bye, Max.
- Max!
- Take care, buddy.
- Armadillo's off the scope.
- I think we've had a blowout.
No sign of the Armadillo.
Get a hold of Truman.
Prepare the world for bad news.
We're getting sketchy information that the mission has suffered massive failure.
And what we're trying to do right now is to confirm that and find out exactly what that means.
Repeat. We're getting leaks from several NASA officials, some rushing home to be with their families, that the drilling was unsuccessful.
This could very well be our final hour.
We're gonna go off the air now.
Good luck and God bless.
- We've got incoming.
- I got tracks.
NORAD's tracking four small incoming over Europe.
I think one's about to hit near Paris.
Reports are coming in.
Martial law has been implemented in 42 countries.
Once the asteroid hits zero barrier, it will take about three hours and 57 minutes to impact Earth.
I guess we do it the president's way.
I'll order an evac.
You can remote detonate.
You still don't think this'll work, do you?
What I think is irrelevant.
- We need to do it now.
- Fine.
- Can they still take off?
- We hope so.
You are the one that pulled them into this!
That is my family up there, so I don't wanna hear, "We hope so"!
Guess what, guys?
It's time to embrace the horror.
Look. We got front-row tickets to the end of the Earth.
Yeah!
Way to go, baby!
Harry!
Yo, Harry! What's up, baby?
Hey, get that bomb outta there!
We got a hole to make!
Houston, you're not gonna believe this, but the other Armadillo has arrived.
All right, people, listen up.
Settle down and focus.
- Mechanical, get on-line.
- P.P.O., gimme a setup.
Your boyfriend's back.
Yo, Harry!
Hey, Harry. You miss me?
A.J., I got just five words for ya.
- Damn glad to see ya, boy!
- That's six words.
Chick, walk 'em down.
So where's this hole you need dug?
Houston, drilling has recommenced.
Do you think they can drill
250 feet in an hour?
They better.
Bring that piece on in, Bear.
Tractor pull.
- I'm comin' down!
- We got 250 feet to go.
It's our last transmission, last drill head.
Punch it through.
First gear. We got contact.
Come on down, A.J.
I got this, man. Let's go!
Lev, the right engine hub.
Houston, I'm getting no response from the preflight sequence.
Come on, now.
This is not... Hey... Hey, come here.
Can you get me outta here, please, Lev?
Thank you.
- Ow! Jesus! Hey!
- Wait.
- Lev, the right engine...
- Okay.
Lemme outta here, will ya?
Just tryin' to have some fun before I die!
- How deep are we?
- Seven seventy.
- Whoa, they got problems.
- The gauges are spiking.
Methane! Shut it down! Back it down!
I can't pull back now.
The bit'll get lodged.
We don't have enough time!
Whoa, whoa, whoa! It's gonna blow!
It's how we lost Max!
I know what I'm talkin' about.
We can punch through this.
We can knock this outta the park.
This is our last transmission, A.J.
Goddamn it, if you're ever gonna trust me, ever, once in your life, trust me now!
Harry, it's gonna blow!
Harry, I know what I'm doin'.
You just gotta trust me.
Make the call.
All right. Hold on.
I'm pushin' through her.
I'm pushin' through her!
- What's your depth?
- Seven seventy-five. Seven eighty.
Take it up, baby! Ram it home!
Drive on down, A.J.!
Seven eighty-five. Come on. Come on.
- Come on, A.J.!
- Punch it!
Ninety-one. Come on.
Seven ninety-two. Seven ninety-five!
Drive it down, A.J.!
Seven ninety-seven! Ninety-nine!
- Breakthrough!
- Eight hundred! Eight-oh-two, Harry!
- Yeah!
- We did it!
- Yes!
- We did it!
- Yeah! Kid, way to go!
- I knew it, baby!
It's not over till we get the bomb down that hole.
Watts, they've got 38 minutes.
Harry, you've gotta give me that hole.
I'm gonna need two more minutes.
I got a bent pipe jammed in the hole.
We gotta cut it out before we can send that bomb down. A.J.!
- She good to go?
- Yeah, I'm all set.
All right.
- All right.
- A.J., come on! Make it fast!
I'm goin' as fast as I can!
There's a lot of gas pressure!
You feel that?
Harry, you gotta give me that hole.
The bomb is almost ready.
- Pull that pipe out!
- Harry, I'm almost through!
Give me 15 more seconds!
Well, this is somethin' new.
I don't think this thing likes us.
That's 'cause it knows we're here to kill it.
Hey, what's goin' on up there?
A.J.!
- What the hell was that?
- A.J.!
Goddamn it, I'm finished!
- A.J., you all right?
- Oh, lot of gas pressure in here, man!
- Get me out!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hydrogen pocket!
Oh! Harry! Pull me in!
Aah! A.J., hang on!
Secure the bomb!
Sharp, heads up!
Gruber! Get outta there now!
Oh, no.
Oh, God, no!
Look out!
Help! Oh, no!
Do you believe that just happened?
- Sharp, you all right?
- I'm okay.
- Bear?
- Yeah. I'm here, Harry.
- A.J.?
- Yeah, I'm okay.
We lost Gruber.
Gruber's dead.
Let's get that bomb ready and go home.
Oh, my God.
Is there a problem, Colonel?
The timer, the remote, the whole thing's dead.
What, the bomb is dead?
No, the trigger's dead.
It must've gotten damaged during the rock storm.
So how do we detonate it?
We have 18 minutes to zero barrier.
We got some bad news.
The remote detonator on the bomb has been damaged.
That means that somebody's gonna have to stay behind.
It takes two people to fly this thing.
Either we all stay and die, or you guys draw straws.
I say we all stay and die. But that's me.
I'll draw. Let's draw.
Nobody's gonna draw straws.
I'll stay and take care of it.
- Well, I can't live with that sort of thing.
- Nobody asked you
- if you could live with it, all right?
- Bullshit!
No way I will let you volunteer for this so I can go back to my home country like the man who didn't volunteer.
No way!
Hey, man, let's draw, and let's see who's gonna stay up here and dance.
Guys, I... I know you guys think I'm crazy right now, but I would really like this responsibility.
- All right. All right.
- I can do it.
Let's just draw straws and get it over with. Come on.
I ain't drawin' against you, Harry.
Well, I'm gonna draw against you, Chick, so you better just go ahead and do it.
Just gimme this thing.
Is this good or bad?
Oh, man.
Well, we all gotta die, right?
I'm the guy who gets to do it saving the world.
So, uh, let's go.
We... We got about ten minutes, right?
You plug this into the port.
Lift, press, hold. That's it.
Lift, press, hold. Shouldn't be too tough.
Even I can't screw this up.
I'll take him down.
Do me a favor, will ya?
Just tell Grace that, uh...
That I'll always be with her, okay?
Can you do that?
Yeah. Okay, kid.
Give this to Truman.
Make sure Truman gets that.
Get in there.
It's my turn now.
Harry! Harry!
You can't do this to me! It's my job!
You go take care of my little girl now.
That's your job.
Always thought of you as a son. Always.
But I'd be damn proud to have you marry Grace.
- Harry.
- You take care of yourself.
- Harry, no!
- I love you, pal.
Harry, I love you! Don't, Harry!
Wait a minute!
- My son.
- Don't do this, Harry!
Don't do this! Harry!
What happened?
That crazy, stubborn son of a...
Well, this was a real good idea.
All right, let's go, Sharp.
Let's get our team outta here.
Come on! Let's get ready to initiate thrusters! Let's go!
- Strap it in, guys!
- Get the O2 masks.
Are they green? Are they green?
I can't believe this is going down like this.
You all right?
- O2 vents locked, pressure loaded.
- Engine board is green.
T minus three minutes and counting.
Houston, do you copy?
This is Harry Stamper.
It's down there.
- Electrical systems primed.
- A.P.U. is set. Oxidizers are loading.
Houston, we're outta here in T minus three minutes.
Daddy!
Hi, Gracie. Hi, honey.
Grace, I know I promised you
I was comin' home.
I don't under... Understand.
Looks like I'm gonna have to break that promise.
I, um... I lied to you, too, when I told you that
I didn't want to be like you.
Because I am like you.
And everything good that I have inside of me, I have from you.
I love you so much, Daddy.
I'm so proud of you.
I'm so scared.
I know it, baby, but there won't be anything to be scared of soon.
Gracie, I want you to know that A.J. saved us. He did.
I want you to tell Chick that I couldn't have done it without him, none of it.
I want you to take care of A.J.
I wish I could be there to walk you down the aisle.
But I'll...
I'll look in on you from time to time, okay, honey?
I love you, Grace.
I love you, too.
- I gotta go now, honey.
- Daddy, no.
No, no, Dad, no.
O.M.S. pod pre-start.
O2 vents locked, pressure loaded.
What the hell's goin' on up there?
Why haven't you guys left yet?
We're going, Harry. Houston.
- We got O.M.S. pod pre-start.
- Pod pre-start confirmed.
- What's the problem?
- I don't know.
- What's wrong?
- Fix it now!
No time, no time!
- What?
- What's that?
- Where you goin'?
- Come on. We're stayin', we're goin'.
We're stayin', we're goin'.
Make up your mind.
Sharp, get out of here now.
You got less than three minutes.
Come on, Watts. Come on, come on.
Blow the bomb, Harry. We're with you.
- Uh, it's stuck. Yes?
- You don't know the components!
Components, American components,
Russian components.
All made in Taiwan!
We're gettin' tight for ignition, Freedom.
Houston, we've got no fire.
- What does that mean?
- It means we got a busted ship.
A busted ship?
And I'm strapped in here.
I had a great spot picked out there.
Freedom, you fire that engine.
If there's not a way, you find a way.
The clock's tickin'.
Let's go!
Let's fire that engine, Freedom!
You got less than a minute.
Don't think I won't blow this thing.
Sharp, get out of here.
It's gettin' bad down here.
I know how to fix it. Please, move.
I... I have to take you away if you don't move.
Watts, you gotta get that shuttle started.
You gotta fire it up now!
Damn it, Sharp. Get off this rock!
I'm telling you, please, move!
This is how we fix problem in the Russian space station.
Because I don't want to stay here anymore.
Yeah! Finally! We can go home!
- She's coming back. She's coming back.
- We're hot!
Watts! Let's go, let's go!
Rain all you want, you son of a bitch.
Let's go! We don't have time!
Hurry, hurry. We got no time!
Initiate thrusters on my mark!
Two, one, mark!
Come on. Get some altitude.
Let's go, let's go.
Freedom has max thrust!
Thank you, Harry.
Shuttle's out of range.
Still no detonation.
Something's not right.
Too much time has gone by.
Zero barrier's about to be breached.
One minute.
Harry, come on. Press that button.
- We're goin' back and do it ourselves.
- Just don't. Wait one minute.
Dan, we're about to cross the threshold.
Come on. Press the button.
Colonel, I'm askin' you.
Just one more minute!
Press the button, Stamper.
Come on.
Harry'll do it. I know it.
He doesn't know how to fail.
We win, Gracie!
Press it!
We have detonation.
Confirming detonation.
The two halves are gonna miss us by 400 miles, and most of the small particles have been vaporized.
- Houston, we're comin' home.
- We copy that, Freedom.
Yo, Harry, you the man.
Kennedy, we see you.
And you never looked so good.
I never told anybody this before but I hate flyin', so it'd be an awful shame to die now.
That's easy for you to say. I owe
100 grand to a bad-ass loan shark, which I spent on a stripper named Molly Mounds.
Boy, that's bad.
Kennedy, we are 100 percent.
Flap suspension control on full.
Welcome home, astronauts.
Hey, guys, remember, we're heroes now.
So that incident with me and the gun on the asteroid, let's keep that under wraps, all right?
Miss Stamper.
Colonel Willie Sharp,
United States Air Force, ma'am.
Requesting permission to shake the hand of the daughter of the bravest man I've ever met.
Hello.
- Oh, my God!
- Hi, you're my hero.
Oh, baby, I wanna have babies with you.
Welcome back, cowboy.
Uh, Harry wanted you to have this.
He did, huh?
I could stay awake
Just to hear you breathin'
Watch you smile while you are sleepin'
While you're far away and dreamin'
I just wanna stay with you
In this moment forever
Forever and ever
I don't wanna close my eyes
I don't wanna fall asleep
'Cause I miss you, baby
And I don't wanna miss a thing
'Cause even when I dream of you
The sweetest dream would never do
I'd still miss you, baby
And I don't wanna miss a thing
And I don't wanna miss one smile
And I don't wanna miss one kiss
Well, I just wanna be with you right here
With you just like this
Well, I just wanna hold you close
Feel your heart so close to mine
And just stay here in this moment
For all the rest of time
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah
Don't wanna close my eyes
I don't wanna fall asleep
'Cause I miss you, baby
And I don't wanna miss a thing
'Cause even when I dream of you
The sweetest dream would never do
I'd still miss you, baby
And I don't wanna miss a thing
Don't wanna close my eyes
I don't wanna fall asleep
Yeah
I don't wanna miss a thing
All my bags are packed
I'm ready to go
I'm standin' here outside your door
I hate to wake you up to say good-bye
But the dawn is breakin'
It's early morn
The taxi's waitin'
He's blowin' his horn
Already I'm so lonesome
I could die
So kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go
'Cause I'm leaving on a jet plane
I don't know when I'll be back again
Oh, babe, I hate to go
I'm leaving on a jet plane
Leaving on a jet plane
Every hellspawn all the way back to the primordial past has lost their struggle with the darkness.
Don't give into the demons.
You hear me, soldier?
Don't let the demons take you.
When you pulled that trigger, you made Hell take notice.
Spawn was born on that day.
We were partners, Jess.
From the day we met, my job was to whack you.
- Who gave the order?
- It was Wynn!
I killed him!
Confessions of a fruitcake... probably nothing.
Check the alleys for another body anyway.
Detectives Burke and Williams,
I'm Lisa Wu, "Washington Post."
You're investigating murders committed in the alleys off 42nd Street.
No comment, lady.
Have you found the guns used in the murders?
Get away from me!
A hellspawn can be free of the curse.
How can you know that?
Because I am free.
No!
We've all seen faces that make us turn our heads... people with scars or bad burns.
But what if it went way beyond that?
What if someone had a face so ugly and hideous that even they couldn't bear the sight of themselves?
That's what happened to Al Simmons, now trapped in a burned body that's not even his own, returning for a lover who's now lost.
He remembers the way his wife used to touch him, caress his face, kiss his lips.
He might as well be trapped in a stony tomb... coldness seeping into the bones, all alone, suffocating in the total darkness.
How does one find humanity in an alley?
How does one regain one's soul in an abandoned church?
For this newest hellspawn, this alley is a waystation... his special purgatory.
...in sickness and in health, until death do you part.
He lurks here in the shadows, amid this human debris, waiting... just inside the portal from Hell.
But this is not his domain.
His domain is that burned skin, his shell of necroplasm and the scarlet shroud which hovers around him, protecting him and possessing him at the same time.
Where is the old man?
- Why isn't he here?
- L... I don't know.
He's a ghost like you.
He just appears.
Al, what's happening to your face?
He's laughing at me!
Hey, come on... it's okay, man. It's okay.
Look, it's just the church bells, man.
Come on, it's
Sunday morning.
Stop it!
Leave me alone!
I am still alive.
Did you think you could strike a deal with Malebolgia... and then renege?
This is a graveyard.
I can feel the death.
Yes, look around you.
These artifacts are all that remain from hellspawns of the past.
They were cursed like you.
This is their shrine... a reminder of what may be your fate!
Maybe you're not a crazy old bum.
What do they call you?
I have had many names.
In this time, they call me Cogliostro.
How long have you been hiding here?
Hiding?
I've been here for many years.
You see, I'm the night curator of antiquities.
This is how I have kept these relics safe
- while I waited for you.
- Waited?
In every age a hellspawn is sent.
I tried to guide them, as I've tried to guide you.
But they are lost souls.
I'm not them.
This is your tomb.
What deal did you strike with him?
It was the time of knighthood,
Time of the Mist.
After the endless battles and the slaughter of innocents, it was I who was sent by Malebolgia to collect the souls and ride with them in the air at night... the Ride of the Dead.
But never to die.
There was no honor in that... not for a knight.
My honor had been taken from me.
I turned away from killing.
The Black Arts drew me.
I struggled with the evil inside and used sorcery to free myself.
In that time
I was known as Merlin.
If you are the Black Knight, then I want answers.
Your flesh rebels against you.
The shroud attacks you.
You wallow in self-pity.
Your loss!
I don't want to hear any more talk, old man!
You claim to be some kind of wizard.
Show me what this goddamn shroud is good for!
No.
You will, old man.
This is not the alley, Hellspawn.
I make the rules in this place.
You are in my domain.
They may have taken your honor but they stole my life.
I came back for Wanda.
But she sees me as a monster.
Do you wish to find the answers?
What are you prepared to do?
I am going to get my life back.
If you won't help me, I'll find the answers somewhere else.
One of your officers found a report on a cop killed in the alleys.
Jason, you're a busy man.
Why are you spending your time reading our New York City police reports?
Chief Banks, if I didn't feel you served a purpose for me,
I wouldn't have gotten you nominated for police commissioner and we wouldn't be having this conversation, would we?
Mr. Wynn, l-I didn't mean to imply that...
The report was written by an officer named Max Williams.
Twitch... smart cop, thorough.
His partner is Sam Burke... a meat-and-potatoes guy.
Your smart cop describes the shooting death of one of your best officers, killed in the alleys.
The dying man's last words on earth were
"red cloak"...find the man in the red cloak.
Don't move in on him until you call me.
Consider it done.
The damn thing is no good.
The sights are off or something.
Yes, sir.
Worthless piece of shit.
- It's jammed!
- Fortunately...
I can usually shoot the dick off a squirrel from here.
Look at this junk.
Stupid gun!
Your lack of aim is surely the gun's fault, sir.
- Lack of aim, huh?
- What? You think you can do better?
You know, Twitch, you really lost your sense of humor. You're too serious.
You gotta learn to lighten up a little.
Let's just see now.
Lucky son of a bitch.
Give me that gun.
Burke! I thought they weren't gonna let you back on the range after that incident last week.
Hey, I've been cleared of that one.
It was the guy's fault... he should have ducked.
You're at a disadvantage,
Burke.
Your gut keeps you too far from the target.
Hey, Twitch, I think the Chief just cracked a joke.
All right, this is your report on one of ours that was killed in the alleys?
We closed that case.
It was our collar.
That cop was killed by a crazy priest.
Before he died, that cop said there were two of them.
That leads me to believe that maybe the priest had a playmate.
He also said something about a red cloak.
I remember... that's a detail I shouldn't have missed, Chief.
Get me a perp.
I don't care if you gotta eat, sleep and breathe those alleys.
And I don't care how much shit you step in.
You should feel right at home there, Burke.
Check it out.
You're missing the point, Lisa.
I don't want you to have a good time in New York.
I want you to have a Ionely, exhausting trip, which indicates to me that you're writing a story that will spill a lot of ink.
Let's cut the bullshit.
If I wasn't the best you wouldn't have sent me.
You got a thing for these psychos, Lisa.
You always manage to get close to them.
Yeah, well my job is to hunt them down.
They all give off the same scent.
What scent is that?
Evil.
- Hey, Lisa?
- Yeah?
You're spooky.
Now tell me what you have.
This guy wears a red cloak.
Hey, he's no joke.
He murders people.
I'm gonna find him and deliver to you his head on a platter.
Like doll's eyes.
Fourth time with this zombie and we don't have shit.
The guy has no prints, no name.
And as soon as he starts in about
"the dead guy is back," I'm gone.
I can't do a fifth dance with this twisted sister.
Nice digs.
It's a good thing you're getting some R&R, big guy.
A wallflower, huh?
You see this?
This is a forensic report.
It says that your DNA matches the cells found underneath the nails of a dead bum.
We also have witnesses that say you killed this less fortunate fellow.
We found this nearby.
He's dead.
I saw him burned to a crisp.
But he's back.
That's it, I'm gone.
Come on, Twitch.
Who's back from the dead?
He looked at me with those green eyes.
That cloak... it reached out
- and touched me like it was alive.
- Did you say cloak?
He's gonna drag me back to Hell.
Tell me, who's come from Hell?
Simmons...
Al Simmons.
What the hell are you doing?
Just checking some details, sir.
How's the chili dog?
Kind of light on the onions.
That may signal a slight improvement in air quality.
Yeah yeah yeah... what a comedian.
I'm gonna grab a soda.
You came in looking for me. Why?
Shall we have a seat?
You wrote some articles for "The Washington Post" about a soldier named Al Simmons.
That's old news, detective.
Why the interest?
I was just wondering if you could offer me anything that was too sensitive to put in print.
- Like?
- You tell me.
A member of a special ops group that saved the president a few years back.
But you already knew all that before you came in the door.
I'm like you...
I do my homework.
You know what, Twitch?
I like you.
You're a good cop.
And I'm a good reporter.
And I know a fluff job when I hear it.
So let's cut the bullshit.
You tell me something,
I'll tell you something.
Ladies first.
I wasn't allowed to print the fact that Al Simmons was burned alive on a mission that the NSC says didn't happen.
Your turn.
I'm working the alley murders... looking for a guy with a red cloak.
I have a perp down at Bellevue that says he got a good look at this guy in the alley; says he has a burned face.
Now you tell me Al Simmons was burned alive.
Coincidences do happen.
I don't believe in coincidences.
Thank you for your time, Miss Wu.
I see the way you look when you talk about Al.
You really loved him.
He was my husband.
No, I mean he was "the one."
Is this going to show up in the paper?
This is just you and me.
What you said before about Al... you're right.
He was that one.
Just hearing his voice excited me.
When he touched me... after he died,
I ached for him.
For months I'd sleep with his shirt or his robe... anything that smelled like him.
Mommy, where are you?
Mom? Mommy.
Mommy's in here, sweet girl.
There you are.
Hi, you're a pretty lady.
I remember you.
I've never seen her take to someone so quickly.
You have a way with her.
Is she Al's child?
No...
Al couldn't give us a child.
Oh...
What's happening with the NSC and Terry?
He lost his job.
Come on, Cyan.
- I'm glad he's not there.
- Up, Mommy.
We're a lot better off now.
Hmm...
Jason Wynn will topple off the mountain.
It is just a matter of time, Wanda.
We almost lost everything. And I still can't get Terry to talk about it.
He stays away for days at a time.
Maybe he's protecting you.
Sometimes the truth is brutal.
It's driving us apart.
Something's wrong.
But he won't let me inside.
Maybe you haven't grieved Al's death.
Do you sometimes feel that he's still with you?
You've seen him, haven't you?
The creature?
Twice.
I've seen what he's capable of and I haven't told anyone.
You know who it is, don't you?
He spoke my name.
There was something in his voice.
I think you should go now.
If you can hear me, Al,
I know you're with me.
I feel it.
Wanda.
I'm hungry, Mama.
I ask you to step out where I can see you... very respectfully.
I warned the last cop not to come into my alley.
Are you threatening me?
What would you do about it?
I'd shoot you between the eyes.
Did you kill him... the police officer?
You got some hard bark on you for a little guy.
No, I didn't kill him.
Murders have occurred in this alley.
One victim was a homeless man.
We have a suspect who wears a skull face... a ritual of some kind.
Chapel... I left him alive for you.
This man you call Chapel... we have him locked away.
He's quite completely insane.
So naturally when he described you,
- we didn't believe it.
- You believed it. You're here.
He claims you're Al Simmons, a soldier who was burned alive five years ago.
What do you think?
I think you've somehow survived a government cover-up.
You're closer than you think.
Can you get me closer?
You want to be a knight in shining armor?
Go play cops and robbers.
Forget all about this.
I wouldn't wanna see your body dumped in my alley.
Confirm Chapel's involvement.
Chapel was just a puppet.
The NSC was pulling the strings.
Who's the puppet master?
What difference does it make?
Do you think you can stop them, little man?
I can do my best.
You were a soldier once... a hero to your country.
What happened to your code of honor?
When you play with matches, you can get burned.
Don't come down to these alleys again.
One of your officers has accessed some of my files,
Chief Banks. Why?
I don't know anything about it.
The only guy here capable of doing that would be Twitch...
Officer Williams.
You asked about him before.
He's working on the killings in the alley.
Find out what he knows.
And after I get the information from Officer Williams?
I understand that New York's Finest who are killed in the line of duty are given quite a hero's burial.
Just tell me where to send the flowers, Chief Banks.
I spoke with the red-cloaked man here in this place.
I believe he's still somewhere in these alleys.
Okay, I'm gonna take a look around, check it out.
This goes all the way up to a high official in the NSC.
And who would this official be?
The only man who can make decisions at this level is Jason Wynn.
My instinct is that the suspect we have down at Bellevue is one of his assassins.
That's quite a story, Twitch.
It sounds like you have a very solid lead.
You've done well, officer.
The department is proud of you.
Thank you, sir.
Officer down!
Get a goddamn ambulance down here!
Jesus, he's bleeding hard from his head.
Officer down! Do you hear me,
God damn it?
Twitch is down!
Goddamn bugs.
Oh, shit.
Oh, crap.
Well, Nick the Dick.
What a surprise.
Where you coming from, Nick?
Fishing in Cuernavaca.
Mm-hm. Sure you were.
What do you say we take a look at your catch, huh?
Come on.
Me, I would've thrown them back.
So, Nick, what do you get?
Like a hundred bucks a head here? Two hundred?
Hope you saved it all for your lawyer, my friend, because you are gonna need it.
We'll take it from here.
Who the hell are you?
INS, Division 6.
Division 6?
I never heard of Division 6.
Really?
Who you got your money on, Dee?
Tough call, Kay.
We've got a winner here, Dee.
Oh, I know.
Sir. Sir, you can't just...
Don't "sir" me, young man.
You have no idea who you're dealing with.
We're gonna have a little chat with our friend here.
You fellas can hit the road.
Keep on protecting us from the dangerous aliens.
You ever hear of Division 6?
There is no Division 6.
This is bullshit.
Hell, yeah.
Looks like you fell off the bus in the wrong part of town, amigo.
In fact, I'm gonna bet dollars to pesos you're not from anywhere near here.
Mikey?
Mikey, when did they let you out of jail?
Political refugee, right.
You know how many treaties you just violated?
One?
Try seven.
That's enough, Mikey.
You hand me that head.
Put up your arms and all your flippers.
AW, shit.
Dee, shoot him.
Dee!
Th... Th...
Th... Th...
"That."
That...
Wa... Wa... Wa...
Was not human. I know.
Looks like you got some entrails on you there, pal.
- What the hell?
- The situation's under control.
Calm down, please. Give me your attention for a moment.
I'll be glad to tell you what happened.
This is called a neuralyzer. It's a gift from some friends from out of town.
This red eye here will isolate the electronic impulses in your brains.
And more specifically, the ones for memory.
That's good, fellas. Give me a splay burn around the perimeter with holes at 40, 60 and 80 meters from right here.
Thank you.
That's good. Thank you.
What in the hell is going on?
Excellent question.
And the answer you're looking for lies right here.
- Who are you, really?
- Really?
I am just a figment of your imagination.
Damn, what a gullible breed.
I'm serious, fellas. You're lucky to be alive after a blast like that.
What blast?
The underground gas main, genius.
You fellas need to exercise a lot more caution before discharging your firearms,
I'll tell you that right now.
Especially you.
Have yourself checked out with EMS on the other side of the hill before you leave.
I'm sorry about back there.
It happens.
Didn't used to.
The spirit's willing, Kay... but the rest of me...
They're beautiful, aren't they?
What?
The stars.
We never just look any more No.
I'll tell you, Kay,
I will miss the chase.
No, Dee, you won't.
Freeze! N.Y.P.D. Freeze!
All yours, Edwards.
"Freeze" means stop.
Yo! Whoa!
What the hell?
All right. Come on.
It just be raining black people in New York.
Do you see this? Huh?
"N-Y-P-D."
Means I will knock your punk ass down.
He's coming. He's coming.
Yeah, and when he gets here,
I'll arrest his ass too.
Oh, you trying to catch a beat-down, huh?
What's up?
He's coming.
He's coming because I failed, and now he'll kill me too.
Yeah? Well, you're just pissing everybody off today, huh?
You don't understand.
Your world's gonna end.
What the hell are you?
Hey, watch that ledge.
Watch the ledge.
Wait. Look, look, come on down.
We'll get those eyes fixed.
Don't even worry about it.
Look, all right, wait a minute.
Let me talk to you. Hey! Hey!
I go out, I work my butt off to make a living.
All I want is to come home to a nice, clean house with a nice, fat steak on the table, but instead I get this.
It looks like poison.
Don't you take that away.
I'm eating that, damn it.
It is poison, isn't it?
I swear to God, I would not be surprised if it was, the way you skulk around here like a dog who been hit too much or ain't been hit enough,
I can't make up my mind.
You're useless, Beatrice.
The only thing that pulls its weight around here is my goddamn truck.
Figures.
What the heck is it, Edgar?
Get your big butt back in the house.
Place projectile weapon on the ground.
You can have my gun when you pry it from my cold, dead fingers.
Your proposal is acceptable.
Edgar, what on Earth was that?
Sugan
I've never seen sugar do that.
Give me sugar.
In water.
More.
More.
Edgar, your skin is hanging off your bones.
Oh, yeah.
There. Is that better?
"The perpetrator then blinked two sets of eyelids."
You mean blinked with both eyes?
No, sir, he blinked one set, then he blinked a completely different set.
You know, like high beams and low beams.
Was that before or after he drew the weapon that you claim evaporated into a million pieces?
After, sir.
And why is it that none of the other officers saw either of these two events?
Well, sir, some of the other officers are a little soggy around the midsection.
I guess that's why they weren't able to keep up.
Hey, Edwards, if you were half the man I am...
What the hell are you talking about?
I am half the man that you are.
What is your problem?
My problem is you being all up in my damn face.
I think he threw him off the roof.
Really? Maybe you next.
I wanna talk to you.
Ten minutes, you take your best shot, tough guy.
Take 10 minutes on a StairMaster, you pudgy bastard.
I believe you.
Laurel Weaver, deputy medical examiner.
Find me at the morgue on 26th. I'll show you.
Wait a minute.
Hey, wait a minute.
Excuse me, you're Dr. Weaver with the coroner's office working on the John Doe, right?
Yes, that's right.
Will you look at this, please?
Phew.
Some night, huh?
Yeah, some night.
They were gills, not eyelids.
Gills.
He was out of breath.
Who are you?
Did he say anything to you?
Yeah, he said the world was coming to an end.
Did he say when?
Would you recognize that weapon of his if you saw it again?
Absolutely.
Come on, let's take a ride.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Look, I got tons of paperwork and...
Right, it's all done.
Good work, Edwards.
You really ran this dude down on foot?
That's tough, kid.
That's double tough.
So who exactly are you with?
FBI? NSA?
I'm part of a bureau that licenses, monitors and polices alien activity on the planet Earth.
- Yeah, whatever.
- We're here.
This is where we going?
Yeah.
This is Jack Jeebs' spot.
He buys from chain-snatchers.
He doesn't even sell guns.
Really?
All right, look, I'm gonna slide up in here and I'm gonna put my thing down, but when I come back out,
I want some real answers.
Okay, go put your thing down.
Officer Eduardo.
Hey, how did these get here?
I thought I turned these in to the proper authorities.
The way I hear it, Jeebsie, you into something a little hotter than some stolen Rolexes.
Yeah, well, I'm a huge crack dealer now, but
I still work here because I love the hours.
I'm talking about guns, smart-ass. Weird ones.
Come on, Edwards.
What you see is what I got.
Why don't you show him the imports, Jeebs?
Hey, Kay. How are you?
Show him the imports right now.
I got out of that business a long time ago.
Why do you lie to me?
I hate it.
Now, just hold on a second.
I'm gonna count to three.
- He'll do it, Jeebs.
- One.
That man does not look stable.
Two.
You know what? Talk to me.
He's crazy when he's like this.
He's always crazy. Why don't you get a massage?
Take a cruise...
Three.
Drop the weapon.
Put your hands on your head.
I warned him.
Drop the weapon.
You warned him.
Don't make me kill you.
You insensitive prick.
Do you have any idea how much that stings?
Show us the merchandise or you're gonna lose another head, Jeebs.
Mr. Edwards.
Right there, the one in the middle.
You sold a reverberating carbonizer with mutate capacity to an unlicensed cephalopoid,
Jeebs, you piece of...
He looked all right to me.
Must have been for an assassination.
Who's the target?
You know, I don't know.
Goddamn it, Jeebs.
I don't know.
That's confiscated, all of it, and I want you on the next transport off this rock or I'm gonna shoot you where it don't grow back.
Yeah, and...
And I'm gonna be back to talk about them Rolexes.
Searching for a handle on the moment?
I can't help you.
The only comfort
I can offer is my promise that tomorrow morning you won't remember a thing.
Yeah, well, that's not exactly some shit you just forget.
You ever seen one of these, son?
She looks over at her husband, then she sets it back down in her lap and she says,
"Honey, this one's eating my popcorn."
Did you get it?
"This one's eating my..."
Whoa. I gotta go.
Thanks for the egg rolls, kid.
Hey, wait a minute. Who are you?
You see what I mean about tequila?
You're a very bright young man, James, but you need to lay off the sauce.
Now, I'll see you bright and early, 9:00.
Be there or be square.
Well, well, well.
Moving right in, are we?
Think we own the place?
I got a little eviction notice for you boys.
Just what exactly do you think you're doing here?
I'm taking care of your pest problem.
Pest problem?
Pest?
Yeah, you got a hell of an infestation.
You know, I've noticed an infestation here.
Everywhere I look, in fact, nothing but undeveloped, unevolved, barely conscious pond scum totally convinced of their own superiority as they scurry about their short, pointless lives.
Well, yeah.
Don't you wanna get rid of them?
Oh, in the worst way.
Help you?
Yeah, this dude gave me this card...
Elevator.
You're late. Sit down.
My name is Zed.
You're all here because you're the best of the best.
Marines, Air Force, Navy
SEALS, Army Rangers, N.Y.P.D.
And we're looking for one of you, just one.
What will follow is a series of simple tests for motor skills, concentration, stamina.
I see we have a question.
Yeah, I'm sorry, maybe you already answered this, but why exactly are we here?
Son?
Second Lieutenant Jake Jensen.
West Point graduate with honors.
We're here because you're looking for the best of the best of the best, sir.
What's so funny, Edwards?
Your boy Captain America over here.
"The best of the best of the best, sir."
You know, "With honors."
You know, he's just really excited, and he has no clue why we're here.
That's just...
That's very funny to me.
Y'all ain't laughing, though.
Okay, let's get going.
Wanna get down on this?
Edwards, what the hell happened?
Hesitated.
May I ask why you felt little Tiffany deserved to die?
Well, she was the only one that actually seemed dangerous at the time, sir.
How'd you come to that conclusion?
Well, first I was gonna pop this guy hanging from the streetlight.
And then I realized, you know, he's just working out.
How would I feel if somebody come running in the gym, bust me in my ass while I'm on the treadmill?
Then I saw this snarling beast guy.
I noticed he had a tissue in his hand, and I realized he's not snarling, he's sneezing.
You know, ain't no real threat there.
Then I saw little Tiffany.
I'm thinking, you know, 8-year-old white girl, middle of the ghetto, bunch of monsters, this time on night, with quantum-physics books?
She about to start some shit, Zed.
She's about 8 years old.
Those books are way too advanced for her.
If you ask me,
I say she's up to something.
And to be honest, I'd appreciate it if you eased up off my back about it.
Or do I owe her an apology?
That was a good shot, though, right?
He's got a real problem with authority.
So do I.
But this kid ran down a cephalopoid on foot, boss.
That's gotta be tough enough.
Let's hope you know what you're doing.
Gentlemen, congratulations.
You're everything we've come to expect from years of government training.
And now, if you'll just follow me, we have one more test to administer: an eye exam.
Where are you going?
Yo. Hey, man, what the hell is all this?
Back in the mid-1950s, the government started a little underfunded agency with the simple and laughable purpose of establishing contact with a race not of this planet.
If you'll look directly at the end of this device, we'll administer the eye test.
Everybody thought the agency was a joke except the aliens who made contact March 2,
1961, outside New York.
There were nine of us the first seven agents, one astronomer and one dumb kid who got lost on the wrong back road.
Oh, you brought that tall man some flowers.
This way.
They were a group of intergalactic refugees.
Wanted to use the Earth as an apolitical zone for creatures without a planet.
Did you ever see the movie Casablanca?
It's the same thing, except no Nazis.
Oh.
We agreed, and we concealed all the evidence of their landing.
Uh-huh. So these are real flying saucers and the World's Fair was just a cover-up for their landing?
Why else would we hold it in Queens?
More nonhumans arrive every year, and they live among us in secret.
Look, I'm sorry, not to change the subject or anything, but when was the last time you had a CAT scan?
Six months ago.
It's company policy.
Right, you should make another appointment.
Look, tell your boy Zed I had an absolutely wonderful time, and thank you for everything, but why don't you show me the door?
All right. I'm gonna get some coffee.
You want some coffee?
No, thank you, I'm fine.
Okay.
How you doing, fellas?
Hi, Kay.
Hi, Kay.
That's not decaf, is it?
Viennese cinnamon.
Don't tell me we only got that powdered stuff for cream again.
I hate that stuff.
Oh, that's good. Good, good.
You guys getting along all right?
Well, don't work too hard.
Okay. Bye.
So you guys seen...?
Sure you don't want some coffee?
All right, kid, here's the deal.
At any given time, there are around 1500 aliens on the planet, most of them right here in Manhattan.
And most of them are decent enough.
They're just trying to make a living.
Cabdrivers.
No, not as many as you'd think.
Humans, for the most part, don't have a clue.
They don't want one or need one either.
They're happy.
They think they have a good bead on things.
But why the big secret?
People are smart. They can handle it.
A person is smart.
People are dumb, panicky, dangerous animals, and you know it.
Fifteen hundred years ago, everybody knew the Earth was the center of the universe.
Five hundred years ago, everybody knew the Earth was flat.
And 15 minutes ago, you knew that people were alone on this planet.
Imagine what you'll know tomorrow.
What's the catch?
The catch?
The catch is, you will sever every human contact.
Nobody will ever know you exist anywhere.
Ever.
I'll give you to sunrise to think it over.
Hey. Is it worth it?
Oh, yeah, it's worth it.
If you're strong enough.
What's up, pops?
All right,
I'm in because, look, there's some next-level shit going on around here, and I'm with that.
But before y'all get to beaming me up, there's a couple things I want you to understand.
First off, you chose me, so you recognize the skills.
And I don't want nobody calling me "son" or "kid" or "sport" or nothing like that.
Cool?
Cool. Whatever you say, slick.
But I need to tell you something about all your skills.
As of right now, they mean precisely dick.
- Purpose of trip?
- Diplomatic mission.
Duration of stay?
Lunch.
Any fruits or vegetables?
Please meet your party outside the containment area.
You wanna stay away from that guy. He's, uh...
He's grouchy.
Three-hour delay in customs after a trip of 17 trillion miles is gonna make anybody cranky, you know what I mean?
Hey, what branch of the government do we report to?
None. They ask too many questions.
So who pays for all this?
We hold patents on a few gadgets we confiscated.
Velcro, microwave ovens, liposuction.
That's a fascinating little gadget.
It's gonna replace CDs soon.
I guess I'll have to buy
The White Album again.
Oh. That is a lot of fun.
It's a universal translator.
We're not even supposed to have it. I'll tell you why.
Human thought is so primitive, it's looked upon as an infectious disease in some of the better galaxies.
That kind of makes you proud, doesn't it? Huh?
Hey, what's this thing?
Okay, just be calm.
Just be... Relax.
Okay... Ooh, watch your head.
Somebody get him some ice.
Look out. Move... Just move when it's coming at you.
Oh, damn. I will pay for that.
Oh!
This thing caused the 1977 New York blackout.
Practical joke by the Great Attractor.
He thought it was funny as hell.
Sorry, y'all.
It was a accident. Sorry.
Observation, the heart of our little endeavor.
Meet the twins, Blblup and Bob.
This map shows the location of every registered alien on Earth at any give time, some of them under constant surveillance.
Everyone on those screens is an alien.
In public they're as normal as you are, but in private, well...
You'll get the idea.
Oh, man.
Doesn't make any sense, does it?
Well, no, it makes perfect sense.
When I was in third grade, everybody told me I was crazy, but I knew our teacher had to be from, like, Venus or something like that.
Mrs. Edelson. It was Jupiter, actually. Well, one of the moons.
...revolve. Class, be quiet and pay attention.
If I have to tell you one more time...
Edwards. Let's put it on.
Put what on?
The last suit you'll ever wear.
You will dress only in attire specially sanctioned
by MIB Special Services.
You'll conform to the identity we give you,
eat where we tell you, live where we tell you.
From now on, you'll have no identifying marks of any kind.
You will not stand out in any way.
Your entire image is crafted to leave no lasting memory with anyone you encounter.
Ow!
You are a rumor, recognizable only as déjá vu
and dismissed just as quickly.
You don't exist.
You were never even born.
Anonymity is your name, silence, your native tongue.
You are no longer part of the system.
You are above the system over it, beyond it.
We're "them." We're "they."
We are the Men in Black.
You know what the difference is between you and me?
I make this look good.
We're gonna go for a little ride.
I'll put you down here for just a minute.
Then Daddy will be right back.
Okay, now we're ready to go for a little ride.
We're gonna meet one of Daddy's friends, and you're gonna like him.
Okay, let's see.
Bee, we've got the deposed
Sir Prefect of Singalee touching down on the forest outside Portland tonight.
- Humanoid?
- You wish. Bring a sponge.
Here. Red letter from last night.
We had an unauthorized landing somewhere in upstate New York.
Kay, keep your ears open on this one.
We're not hosting an intergalactic kegger down here.
Well, well, well, we got a skimmer.
Landed alien out of zone. Who is it?
Redgick.
He's not cleared to leave Manhattan, but he's way out of town right now, stuck on the
New Jersey Turnpike.
Why don't you take junior here with you?
This is a good one for him to warm up on.
Go get him, tiger.
"We're not hosting an intergalactic kegger."
Zed. He just...
Unlimited technology from the whole universe and we cruise around in a Ford POS.
Fasten your seat belt.
See, now, we got to work on your people skills.
You know, you'd get a much better reaction if you were a little more polite.
Fasten your seat belt, please.
Whoa, that was good.
Did you hurt yourself? Oh!
Oh, the red button there, kid.
Don't ever, ever touch the red button.
All right, bub, that'll be $72, then.
Okay, sweetie, let me pay the impolite driver.
Six is up.
Where is Ivan?
Gave him a break.
You can kill us both, but you will not find the Galaxy.
You're right about one thing.
You're not going anywhere, pal.
What's going on?
Hey, hey, hey, easy.
I'd like to see your license and registration, please.
Like to see your other license and registration, please.
All right, your resident-alien card has you restricted to the island of Manhattan.
Where are you going, Redgie?
Well, it's my wife. She's...
Well, look.
Oh. All right.
Okay, no big deal.
Okay, you come with me, Redge.
And you handle this.
What? Me?
Yeah, it's easy.
You just catch.
Are you sure he knows what he's doing?
He does it all the time.
Let the man work.
Okay. Yeah.
Ooh! Kay. Oh... Damn, man. Kay?
Something's peeking.
Croagg the midwife is at 54th and Madison.
You're headed out of town,
Redgie. What's going on?
Well, we're meeting someone.
Who you meeting?
Well, it's a ship.
A ship?
I didn't see a departure clearance for today.
You didn't?
No.
- Well, it's... Well, it's an emergency.
- Kay! Kay!
You're doing fine, ace.
What kind of emergency?
What's the rush to get off the planet all of a sudden?
We just don't like the neighborhood any more.
Some of the new arrivals.
What new arrivals?
Does it have anything to do with the crasher from last night?
Excuse me, miss.
Oh, man. Oh, man.
Kay, look. Oh, man.
Congratulations, Redge, it's a... squid.
Kay, man.
You know, it's actually kind of...
...cute.
Anything about that seem unusual to you?
What would scare
Redgick so badly that he'd risk a warp jump with a newborn?
We'll check the hot sheets.
These are the hot sheets?
Best investigative reporting on the planet.
Go ahead, read The New
York Times if you want to.
They get lucky sometimes.
Thanks, Manny.
Cannot believe you're looking for tips in the supermarket tabloids.
Not "looking for."
Found.
Wait a minute, slow down.
Why?
Give her time to get the wrong impression.
Makes things go a lot smoother.
Can I help you gentlemen?
Yes, ma'am, I'm Special
Agent Manheim.
This is Special Agent Black of the FBI. We'd like to talk to you about your visitor.
You here to make fun of me too?
No, ma'am. We at the FBI do not have a sense of humor we're aware of.
May we come in?
Sure.
Thank you.
Lemonade?
Oh, yes, please.
The chief of police himself came up to the house and did a full-out professional investigation.
Took a police report and writ down everything I said, from A to Z, not believing one thing I said.
Sort of poking fun at me.
And they asked me,
"if he was murdered, how was he able to walk back in the house?"
I gotta admit to you, that one got me sort of stumped.
But I'll tell you something right now.
I know Edgar, and that wasn't Edgar.
It was like something was wearing Edgar like a...
Like a suit... an Edgar suit.
Dude was that ugly before he was a alien.
I'm sorry.
Go on.
Anyway, I come to and he's gone.
Did he say anything?
Yes. He asked me for some water.
Some, uh, sugar water.
Sugar water?
Yeah, I remember that right, because I thought that that was odd that he asked me for sugar water and not lemonade or ice water or regular water or tap water.
All right, Beatrice.
There was no alien.
The flash of light you saw in the sky was not a UFO.
Swamp gas from a weather balloon was trapped in a thermal pocket and refracted the light from Venus.
Wait... Wait a minute.
You just flash that thing, it erases her memory, and you just make up a new one?
A standard-issue neuralyzer.
And that weak-ass story is the best you can come up with?
All right.
On a more personal note, Beatrice,
Edgar ran off with an old girlfriend.
You're gonna go stay with your mom a couple of nights, you're gonna get over it, and decide you're better off.
Well, yeah, you know, because he never appreciated you anyway.
In fact, you know what?
You kicked him out.
And now that he's gone, you're gonna go into town, you go to Bloomingdale's, find yourself some nice dresses, get yourself some shoes.
You know, find somewhere that maybe you could get a facial.
And, oh, hire a decorator to come in here quick because, damn.
Yo, Kay, look, check it out, man.
When do I get my own flashy little memory-messer-upper thingy?
When you grow up.
Mm. Okay.
Please, not green.
Oh, damn.
I don't suppose you know what kind of alien life form leaves a green spectral trail and craves sugar water, do you?
Oh, wait, that was on
Final Jeopardy! Last night.
Damn, Alex said it was...
Zed, we have a bug.
So, what?
We don't like bugs?
Bugs thrive on carnage, tiger.
They consume, infest, destroy, live off the death and destruction of other species.
You were stung as a child, weren't you?
No, listen, kid, imagine a giant cockroach with unlimited strength, a massive inferiority complex, and a real short temper is tear-assing around Manhattan
Island in a brand-new Edgar suit.
Does that sound like fun?
What's the move?
With the bug in town, we'll watch the morgues.
Where do you want
Contestant Number 3?
Just leave it there.
What's with the cat?
Oh, the cat.
Yeah, well, there's a problem with the cat. Sign here.
What's the problem with the cat?
It's your problem. Heh-heh.
I hate the living.
Shall we?
Oh, my God.
Whoa, buddy, what are you?
Subject was approximately
112 degrees at time of autopsy, indicating an increase in body temperature.
Examiner tried to verify this rectally only to find the subject was without a rectum, which is, needless to say, really...
Weird.
I'm Dr. Leo Manville,
Department of Public Health.
This is Dr. White.
You boys must not have much of a home life.
We watch the morgues very carefully, ma'am.
Tell me, do you have something unusual around here?
I'd say so. Triple homicide.
Mm-hm.
The first body I opened up was pretty normal, except he was broken in half.
But when I opened up the other two, well...
Let me show you.
There's a skeletal structure at work here unlike anything I've ever seen before.
All right,
I'll have a look at this one.
Dr. White, why don't you and Dr. Weaver check out the other body, please?
This way, doctor.
This one's even stranger.
I did a full laparotomy.
I started with the lesser curvature of the stomach, but we could start with the gastroesophageal junction, whichever you prefer.
Let's start wherever you started at.
Okey-dokey.
Oh.
- Is this your cat?
- Guess it is now.
It came in with the body.
Okay, dive right in.
I'm sure he won't mind.
Hm. You have really pretty eyes.
Thank you.
Okay, you feel that? Where the pyloric junction would be?
Push it aside.
Notice anything strange?
Stomach, liver, lungs...
Nope, all fine.
Doctor, they're all missing.
Of course.
Oh, you know, that's obviously the first thing I noticed.
Well, what I was pointing out is the fact that there are no pieces of them left.
Yeah, you know, so they're intact, wherever they are, whole somewhere.
That we can be sure of.
Have we met before?
I'm having the strangest feeling of déjá vu.
Yeah, me too.
Really?
Okay, do you wanna know what I really think?
But don't tell that guy.
He looks like he's under enough stress.
See, I don't think this body's really a body.
I think it's some kind of transport unit for something else altogether.
The question is, what?
Mm-hm.
Is this freaking you out?
No. Pssh! No, girl.
You know what I like to do sometimes when it's really late?
No.
Dr. White.
Um, excuse me.
What do you think?
Very interesting.
She got a real queen-of-the-undead thing going on...
Of the body.
Great body.
The dead body.
Man, you gonna have to go look at that thing.
Dr. White?
You recognize him?
Yeah, he looks like the big guy
I saw down at headquarters,
- only a little deader.
- Dr. White.
What do you think killed him?
A bug?
Dr. White.
You're up, slugger.
Oh.
Look at this.
What the hell is that?
Must...
To prevent... contest.
Okay, what are you trying to say?
To prevent...
To prevent struggle?
No. To prevent...
War?
...war... the Galaxy... is on Orion's... be... Be...
- What is word?
- Bed?
Belt? Orion's belt?
"To prevent war, the Galaxy is on Orion's belt."
What the hell does that mean?
Doctor, uh...
Whatever, come here.
Dr. Whatever?
Hey, you guys aren't really from the Department of Health, are you?
Rosenberg. Aw, damn.
The Arquillians are not gonna like this.
This guy was one of the royal family.
I knew it. This is an alien.
And you guys are from some government agency trying to keep it under wraps.
Look, he said, "To prevent war, the Galaxy is on Orion's belt."
This makes total sense. How else do you explain New York?
The other day, I was in this cab, and this guy was...
"Galaxy on Orion's belt" doesn't make any sense.
Look, that's what the little dude inside the big dude's head said, right?
Right after... Damn, man.
You did the flashy thing already.
Hey, whoever you guys are, you're gonna have to show me ID if you're gonna be in the morgue.
Oh, yes, of course, young lady.
Have a look at this for me, please.
Would you stop that?
What?
That thing is gonna give her brain cancer or something.
Never hurt her before. Look, we gotta get all the doors closed off.
Special Services will be here any minute.
"Never hurt her before"? How many times have you flashy-thinged that woman?
A couple.
So, what, you not worried about long-term damage?
A little.
Kay, have you flashy-thinged me?
No.
I ain't playing with you, Kay.
Have you ever flashy-thinged me?
No.
Look, Kay, I think I should be in charge of the flashy-memory-thing department.
Not while I'm around, ace.
You ain't gonna be happy till you fricassee somebody's brain out, man.
All right, we got two dead aliens.
And a deputy medical examiner needs a new memory.
Yes, sir.
Make it a happy memory.
Oh... Oh...
Where is it?
Will the owner of a blue warp-speed cruiser
please report to the front desk?
Hey, Zed.
Doesn't anybody ever get any sleep around here?
The twins keep us on Centaurian time.
It's a 37-hour day.
Give it a few months.
You'll get used to it.
Or you'll have a psychotic episode. Here's Orion.
It's a grouping of the brightest stars in the northern sky.
And here's Orion's belt.
Right. That's what the little guy said:
"To prevent war, the Galaxy is on Orion's belt."
Junior, there are no galaxies on Orion's belt.
The belt is just these three stars.
Galaxies are huge.
They're made up of billions of stars. You heard wrong.
Look, whatever, man.
I know what I heard.
Pretty lady.
Uh-huh. Okay.
The grumpy guy's story is starting to come into focus a little bit here.
So you were the guy in that picture you showed me with the flowers.
Yeah.
And I take it she never got those flowers.
So, what, she ever get married or anything?
No.
Ah, well, you know what they say:
It's better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all.
Try it.
Kay.
Take a look at this.
My God, they're all leaving.
We've had 12 jump in the last hour.
Redgick was just the first.
What the hell do they know that we don't?
Why does a rat desert a ship?
Give me Lem Sat 4, please, with a proton induction thermoscan.
Thank you.
Okay, Lem Sat 18.
All right, 4000.
That's an Arquillian battle cruiser.
And we've got a dead Arquillian prince.
And speak of the devil.
They sound pissed.
Boys, translate that. Step on it.
Why don't you get down to Rosenberg's jewelry store and see what you can turn up?
Kay.
Give the kid a weapon.
Series 4 De-atomizer.
Now, that's what I'm talking about.
Noisy Cricket.
Hey, Kay, no, no.
Come on, man.
You get a Series 4 De-atomizer,
I get a little midget Cricket?
Whoa, kid!
Feel like I'm gonna break this damn thing.
Hey, this is my truck.
Yeah, and make sure you tell them that down at the impound.
Please.
Who breaks into a jewelry store and leaves all the jewels?
Somebody not looking for jewelry.
This guy had a serious crush on his cat.
Kay, get down.
Man.
That's him. That's the bug in the Edgar suit.
We do not discharge our weapons in view of the public.
Man, we ain't got time for this cover-up bullshit.
I don't know if you've forgotten, but there's a alien battle cruiser about to...
There's always an alien battle cruiser or a death ray or an intergalactic plague that's about to wipe out life on this miserable little planet.
The only way these people get on with their happy lives is they do not know about it.
And don't worry about the bug.
He's not leaving town.
We got his ship.
Excuse me. Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen.
Zed, we need a containment crew on Macdougal Street
south of Houston.
Containment may be a moot point, old friend.
The exodus continues.
It's like the party's over and the last one to leave gets stuck with the check.
You sorry little ingrates.
What about the Arquillians?
We've only translated part of the message so far:
"Deliver the Galaxy."
They don't want much, do they?
Oh, it gets better.
They're holding us responsible.
Where do you keep your dead?
I don't have any dead.
Where?
I don't know.
The city morgue?
That's three for a dollar, sir.
It was some light, some light that refracted off of Venus into some swamp gas, and that's what made the...
All right, kid.
Excuse me. What's up?
The Arquillians want the Galaxy, whatever the hell that means.
We need help, a professional, somebody with years of experience in intergalactic politics.
I just hope the little prick hasn't skipped town.
Can I have your attention, please? Thank you.
If you will gather over here...
That's right, move in closer.
That's good. Thanks.
If you'll look right here,
I'd appreciate it.
Thank you.
Now, that's the worst disguise ever.
That guy's definitely an alien.
You don't like it, you can kiss my furry little butt.
You busy, Frank?
Sorry, Kay, can't talk right now.
My flight's leaving in... Whoa!
Get your paws off me.
Call the pound. We got a stray.
The dog owes my friend money.
Arquillians and bugs,
Frank, what do you know?
I know nothing.
Not a thing, huh? Okay.
Stop, stop, stop it.
Okay, okay.
Rosenberg wasn't some two-bit Arquillian.
He was the guardian of a whole Galaxy.
They thought he'd be safe here on Earth.
And the bug had other plans.
The Galaxy is the best source for subatomic energy in the universe.
If the bugs get their slimy claws on it, kiss the Arquillians goodbye.
Ask him about the belt.
Rosenberg said something about a galaxy on Orion's belt.
What's he talking about, Frank?
Beats me.
Beats you.
No, no, no, not around.
They're rehearsing a ventriloquist act.
The Galaxy is here.
What do you mean, here?
Galaxy's hundreds of millions of stars and planets.
How's it here?
You humans.
When are you gonna learn that size doesn't matter?
Just because something's important, doesn't mean it's not very, very small.
How small?
Tiny. The size of a marble or a jewel.
Now if you'll excuse me, I gotta be walked before my flight.
All right, get out of here.
If the Galaxy's here, it's not on Orion's belt.
Kay.
Boy, when you want attention...
Orion. That's a pretty name.
What's this?
Wow.
Okay. Yes, good, thank you.
Thank you for making sure the bell works.
What's up, Farmer John?
A man came in here earlier.
A dead man.
And that means what to me?
It was a very dear friend of mine.
I believe he had an animal with him.
It was a gift I gave him, a pet cat.
It means worlds to me.
I'd like to have it back.
Okay, I'm gonna need a picture ID, written proof of ownership of the cat, notarized proof of kinship with the deceased.
Don't do that.
Do what?
Don't do it.
Oh, man.
Look, Kay, why don't you let me handle this one?
What?
All we gotta do is go in and get a cat.
It's not really that hard, but if you go in there, you're gonna lay your Jack Webb on her, start flashing your brain ray all in her face.
She gonna wind up with leukemia or some shit.
The woman's a doctor.
She don't need you flashing away half her med-school classes.
Five minutes.
Two minutes.
Where's the animal?
I told you, I don't know.
Well, let's see if we can find it.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
How you doing?
Hello.
I'm Sergeant Friday from the 26th Precinct.
A cat came in with a corpse the other day.
"Orion" on the nametag?
Yes, that's right.
Right. Uh, well, this cat is a...
A witness in a murder case.
I need to take him with me, ask him a few questions.
Well, I don't know where the cat is right now.
Oh, you don't?
No, but maybe you could take me with you instead.
Damn, you do start fast, don't you?
I'd really like to go with you. Now.
Uh-huh.
And exactly why is that?
There's something
I need to show you.
Slow down, girl, you ain't gotta hit the gas like that.
No, you don't understand.
You really need to see this.
Oh, I Will, I Will.
I gotta drive.
You know, it's not some macho trip.
I'm saying, that's just the way I get down.
Look, stud, you're really not getting this.
There's something
I need you to help me with.
Freeze it, bug.
Christ, you are thick.
Look, how was I supposed to know?
Do I have to sing it for you?
If you weren't coming on like some drunken prom date...
Oh, God. That is so typical.
Any time a woman shows the slightest hint of sexual independence...
How about we shut up?
Let her go, shit-eater.
Listen, monkey boy, compared to you humans,
I'm on the top rung of the evolutionary ladder.
So can it, all right?
You're breaking my heart. Show me your face, and I'll cure all your ills.
You ever pull wings off a fly?
You care to see the fly get even?
How far do you think you're gonna get without your ship, if that's what you call that piece of space trash we got locked in the office?
- Put your weapons down.
- Never gonna happen, insect.
It's okay, Laurel.
How is it okay?
I'm saying it's gonna be okay.
Don't bet on it, meat sack.
Let me go.
God, what the...?
Come on.
Take me here.
No way.
Take me.
Hey. Come back!
He's in a cab.
Don't move, don't move.
Don't move.
Hey, man, what? Whoa, whoa.
He's not leaving the planet in a cab. Let's go.
Come with me. Put up a bio-net all the way around Manhattan.
If it's not human, I don't want it to leave this island.
Yes, sir.
What do we hear from our friends upstairs?
"Deliver the Galaxy."
The bug's got the Galaxy.
But we got his ship. He's gotta be looking for a way out.
Plutonic fusion detection.
Plutonic fusion detection.
What the hell are they shooting at us for?
Arquillian battle rules, kid.
First, we get an ultimatum, then a warning shot, and then we have a galactic standard week to respond.
A galactic standard week?
How the hell long is that?
One hour.
One hour? Then what?
Aw, that's bullshit.
Look, kid, to keep the bugs from getting it, the Arquillians will destroy that Galaxy.
And whatever planet it's on.
You're talking about us.
Heh-heh. Sucks, huh?
I'm pulling up the location of every interstellar vehicle within a hundred miles.
Already did it. Frank the Pug took the last ship.
We got Sneden's Landing and Throg's Neck.
They're gone.
We have Atlantic City.
Gone.
All right, Bayonne?
Gone.
All right, there's Three Mile Island.
Gone.
- Yo.
- Staten Island.
Gone, thank God.
- Fellas.
- We're running out of time.
If that bug gets off the planet with that Galaxy, we're all bug food.
Hey, old guys.
Do those still work?
- You're coming with me.
- What?
It's a long trip.
I'll need a snack.
Whoa! Ah! Ah!
Wait a minute, you're taking the tunnel?
You know a better way to Queens?
Man, that thing's gonna be packed.
You remember the little red button?
Yeah.
Push the little red button.
And you might wanna put on a seat belt.
Kay. Kay!
You know, you're much too tense.
You're a young man.
You need to relax. Learn to take some joy in your work.
Do you like music?
That's better.
All right, now.
Ah, shit.
Ah, man.
Kay. Kay!
You do know
Elvis is dead, right?
No, Elvis is not dead.
He just went home.
You don't wanna eat me. I'm a very important person on my planet.
Like a queen.
A goddess, even. There are those who worship me.
I'm not telling you to try to impress you.
I'm just letting you know it could start a war.
Good, war. That means more food for my family.
All 78 million of them. That's a lot of mouths to feed, Your Highness.
You're a wonderful dad, but I'm staying here.
Now, that's what I'm talking about.
Roaches check in.
They don't check out.
Eight minutes to the destruction of Earth.
Eight minutes to destruction.
All right, we'll use pulsar level five with a subsonic implosion factor.
What?
Just shoot the damn thing on the count of three. One, two, three.
Oh, you idiots!
You don't get it.
I've won.
It's over.
You're milk-suckers.
You don't matter.
In fact, in a few seconds, you won't even be matter.
You're under arrest for violating
Section 4153 of the Tycho Treaty.
So hand over whatever galaxy you might be carrying, and step away from your busted-ass vehicle, and put your hands on your head.
Okay. Oh, I... I see.
I'll put my hands on...
On my head.
Like this?
Kay...
That did not go at all the way I planned.
Whatever happens, don't let him get on the second ship.
What? What are you talking about?
Keep him on this planet.
Kay... Kay, where are you going?
I'm gonna get my gun back.
Hey. Hey, bug. Wait a minute, I'm talking to you.
You know how many of your kind
I've swatted with a newspaper?
You're nothing but a smear on the sports page to me, you slimy, gut-sucking intestinal parasite.
Eat me. Eat me!
Kay. Kay!
Hey!
What's up?
You're just gonna eat and run, huh?
What about dessert? Ah!
Wha...?
That's it?
Where are you going?
This party's just getting started.
Where you going?
Where you going? Ah!
Let me tell you something.
There's only one way off of this planet, baby, and that's through me.
Hey.
Where you going?
Why you running, huh?
I'm still standing.
Come on, bring it.
Come on, bring it.
Uh-oh. I'm sorry.
Was that your auntie?
Then that must mean that that's your uncle, then, huh?
You know y'all look alike.
Well, well.
Big bad bug got a bit of a soft spot, huh?
See, what I can't understand is why you gotta come down here, bringing all this ruckus, snatching up galaxies and everything.
My attitude is, don't start nothing, won't be nothing.
You need to ease up out of my face before something bad happen to you.
Too late.
Zed, call the Arquillians.
Tell them we have the Galaxy.
You got it, friend.
Going to get your gun back, huh?
I like this gun.
Yeah, well, while you was in there playing around,
I was down here doing all the work.
You know, first I had to bean him in the head with this big rock.
Then I was gonna hit him with this 2-by-4.
He kicked me, and, you know, it hurt.
But then I got to the fire, you know.
I was like "ah" with the fire.
Not bad for your second day of work, is it?
Well, this definitely rates about a 9.0 on my weird-shit-0-meter.
You should've been here for the
Zeronian migration in 1968.
Whoa.
I guess you weren't even alive in '68.
Interesting job you guys have.
Kay, um, look, I know we got these rules and everything, but I was thinking, she did help us bust that bug.
Maybe we didn't have to flashy-thing her.
Kay, come on, man.
What, who's she gonna tell?
She hang out with all dead people.
It's not for her. It's for me.
What?
They're beautiful, aren't they?
Stars.
I mean, I never look at them any more, but they actually are quite, um... beautiful.
Uh, Kay, you're frightening your partner.
I haven't been training a partner.
I've been training a replacement.
Wait a minute, Kay.
I cannot do this job by myself.
Hey, guys, my apartment isn't anywhere near here.
It's not even on the same island.
Days... months... years.
Always face it forward.
Kay...
I've just been down the gullet of an interstellar cockroach, kid.
That's one of a hundred memories that I don't want.
See you around, Jay.
No, you won't.
Hey, Jay.
Zed called. The high consulate from Solaxium 9 wants floor seats for the Knicks-Bulls game.
All right, let's put in a call to Dennis Rodman.
He's from that planet.
Rodman? You're kidding.
Nope.
Not much of a disguise.
Doc.
Doc.
- Doc!
- What?
Relax, Doc. It's me! It's Marty.
It can't be.
I just sent you back to the future.
You did send me back to the future, but I'm back.
I'm back from the future.
Great Scott!
- Hey, kids, what time is it?
- Howdy Doody time!
"It's Howdy Doody time"
Great Scott!
Howdy Doody time?
Sunday, November 13, 1955, 7:01 a.m.
Last night's time travel experiment was apparently a complete success.
Lightning struck the clock tower at 10:04 p. M... sending the necessary 1.21 gigawatts... into the time vehicle, which vanished in a flash of light... leaving a pair of fire trails behind.
I assumed Marty and the time vehicle... were transported forward through time to the year 1985.
After that, I can't recall what happened.
In fact, I don't even remember how I got home.
Perhaps the gigawatt discharge and the temporal displacement field... generated by the vehicle caused a disruption of my own brain waves... resulting in a condition of momentary amnesia.
I now recall that moments after the time vehicle disappeared... into the future...
I saw a vision of Marty saying he had come back from the future.
Hey, Doc.
Undoubtedly, this was some residual image.
Doc, calm down. It's me. It's Marty.
It can't be you. I sent you back to the future!
That's right, but I came back again from the future. Don't you remember?
You fainted. I brought you home.
This can't be happening! You can't be here!
It doesn't make sense!
I refuse to believe you are here!
I am here, and it does make sense.
I came back to 1955 again with you.
The you from 1985 is waiting to get a book from Biff!
Once I got the book, the you from 1985 were in the DeLorean... and it got struck by lightning, and you got sent back to 1885!
It's a very interesting story, future boy... but there's one thing that doesn't make sense.
If the me of the future is now in the past, how could you possibly know about it?
You sent me a letter.
"Dear Marty, if my calculations are correct..."
"you will receive this letter immediately after the DeLorean's struck by lightning."
"First, let me assure you
I am alive and well."
"I've been living happily these past eight months in the year 1885."
"The lightning bolt that hit the DeLorean..."
"caused an overload which scrambled the time circuits..."
"activated the flux capacitor and sent me back to 1885."
"The overload shorted out the time circuits..."
"and destroyed the flying circuits.
Unfortunately, the car will never fly again."
It actually flew?
Yeah. We had a hover conversion done in the early 21st century.
Incredible!
"I set myself up as a blacksmith as a front..."
"while I attempted to repair the damage to the time circuits."
"Unfortunately, this proved impossible..."
"because suitable replacement parts will not be invented until 1947."
"However, I've gotten quite adept at shoeing horses and fixing wagons."
1885! Amazing!
I actually end up as a blacksmith in the Old West.
Pretty heavy.
"I have buried the DeLorean in the abandoned Delgado Mine...
" adjacent to the old Boot Hill Cemetery as shown on the enclosed map.
"Hopefully, it should remain undisturbed and preserved until you uncover it in 1955.
"Inside, you will find repair instructions.
"My 1955 counterpart..." That's me.
"Should have no problem repairing it so that you can drive it back to the future."
"Once you have returned to 1985, destroy the time machine."
- Destroy it?
- It's a long story, Doc.
"I repeat, do not attempt to come back here to get me."
"I am perfectly happy living in the fresh air..."
"and wide-open spaces."
"I fear that unnecessary time travel..."
"only risks further disruption of the space-time continuum."
"And please take care of Einstein for me."
Einstein?
He's your dog, Doc.
Einstein is what you call your dog in 1985.
"I know you will give him a good home."
"Remember to walk him twice a day and that he only likes canned dog food."
"These are my wishes.
Please respect and follow them."
"And so, Marty, I now say farewell and wish you Godspeed."
"You've been a good, kind, and loyal friend to me..."
"and you made a real difference in my life."
"I will always treasure our relationship and think of you with fond memories..."
"warm feelings and a special place in my heart."
"Your friend in time, Doc Emmett L. Brown."
"September 1, 1885."
I never knew I could write anything so touching.
I know, it's beautiful.
It's all right, Copernicus.
Everything will be fine.
I'm sorry.
It's all my fault you're stuck back there.
I never should've let Biff get to me.
There are plenty worse places to be than the Old West.
I could have ended up in the Dark Ages.
They probably would have burned me at the stake as a heretic.
Let's look at the map.
According to this, the time vehicle is sealed off in a side tunnel.
We may have to blast.
I think you woke up the dead with that blast.
Take this camera. I want to document everything!
This reminds me of the time I attempted to reach the center of the Earth.
I'd been reading my favorite author,
Jules Verne.
I spent weeks preparing that expedition.
I didn't even get this far.
Of course, I was only 12 at the time.
You know, it was the writings of Jules Verne... that had a profound effect on my life.
When I was 11, I first read
20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.
It was then that I realized
I must devote my life to science.
Check it out. Look at this.
My initials!
Just like in
Journey to the Center of the Earth!
That means the time machine must be right through this wall!
It's been buried in here for 70 years, two months and 13 days.
Astounding!
"As you see, the lightning bolt shorted out the time-circuit control chip."
"The attached..."
Schematic.
"Schematic diagram will allow you to build a replacement unit..."
"with 1955 components, thus restoring the time machine to perfect working order."
Unbelievable that this little piece of junk could be such a big problem.
No wonder this circuit failed.
It says, "Made in Japan."
What do you mean, Doc?
All the best stuff is made in Japan.
Unbelievable!
You know, when I was a kid,
I always wanted to be a cowboy.
Now, knowing I'm spending my future in the past...
it sounds like a wonderful way to spend my retirement years.
It just occurred to me, since I end up in 1885... perhaps I'm now in the history books.
I wonder.
Could I look myself up in the old newspaper archives?
I don't know.
You always say it's not good to know too much about your own destiny.
You're right, Marty. I know too much already.
Better that I not attempt to uncover the circumstances of my own future.
Copernicus. Come on, boy!
I'll get him.
Copernicus!
Come on. Let's go home, boy.
What's wrong?
What's wrong, Copernicus?
Come on, let's go.
Doc, come here!
Quick!
What's wrong?
You look like you've seen a ghost.
You're not far off, Doc.
Great Scott!
Check this out.
"Died September 7, 1885."
That's one week after you wrote the letter!
"Erected in eternal memory by his beloved Clara."
Who the hell is Clara?
- Please don't stand there!
- Right. Sorry.
I have to get another picture.
"Shot in the back by Buford Tannen over a matter of $80"?
What kind of a future do you call that?
"Buford Tannen was a notorious gunman..."
"whose short temper and a tendency to drool..."
"earned him the nickname 'Mad Dog.'"
"He was quick on the trigger and bragged he had killed 12 men..."
"not including Indians or Chinamen."
- Does it name me? Am I one of the 12?
- Wait.
"This claim cannot be proven since precise records were not kept..."
"after Tannen shot a newspaper editor..."
"who printed an unfavorable story about him in 1884."
- That's why we can't find anything.
- Look.
William McFly and family.
Your relatives?
My great-grandfather's name was William. That's him. Good-looking guy.
McFlys, but no Browns.
Maybe it was a mistake.
Maybe that grave wasn't yours.
There could've been another Emmett Brown in 1885.
Did you have any relatives here back then?
The Browns didn't come to Hill Valley until 1908. Then they were the von Brauns.
My father changed our name during World War I.
Look.
Great Scott, it's me!
Then it is true, all of it.
It is me who goes back there and gets shot.
It's not gonna happen, Doc.
After you fix the time circuits and put new tires on the DeLorean...
I'm going back to 1885, and I'm bringing you home.
The clothes fit?
Everything except the boots.
They're kind of tight.
Are you sure this stuff is authentic?
Of course.
Haven't you ever seen a Western?
Yeah, I have.
Clint Eastwood never wore anything like this.
- Clint who?
- Right. You haven't heard of him yet.
You have to wear the boots.
You can't wear those futuristic things back in 1885.
You shouldn't be wearing them here in 1955.
- As soon as I get there, I'll put them on.
- Okay.
I think we're about ready.
I put gas in the tank.
Your future clothes are packed.
Just in case, fresh batteries for your walkie-talkies.
What about that floating device?
- Hoverboard.
- All right.
It's gonna be a long walk back to Hill Valley from here.
It's still the safest plan.
We can't risk sending you back into a populated area... or to a spot that's geographically unknown.
You don't want to crash into some tree that existed in the past.
This was all completely open country... so you'll have plenty of runout space when you arrive.
Remember, where you're going, there are no roads.
There's a small cave over there which will be a good place to hide the time vehicle.
The new time-circuit control tubes are warmed up.
Time circuits on.
I wrote the letter on September 1, so we'll send you to...
September 2, that's a Wednesday.
September 2, 1885, 8:00 a.m.
I get shot on Monday the 7th.
You have five days to locate me.
According to my letter, I'm a blacksmith, so I probably have a shop somewhere.
All you got to do is drive the time vehicle... directly toward that screen, accelerating to 88 miles an hour.
Wait a minute.
If I drive straight towards the screen,
I'll crash into those Indians.
Marty, you're not thinking fourth dimensionally.
You'll instantly be transported to 1885 and those Indians won't even be there.
Right.
Good luck, for both of our sakes.
See you in the future.
- You mean the past.
- Exactly.
Happy trails, Marty!
Ready, Marty?
Ready!
- Set!
- Hi-ho, Silver.
Indians!
The cave!
Charge!
Shit! The cavalry!
Damn, I ripped the fuel line.
Maggie! Fetch some water!
We got a hurt man here.
Mom.
- Mom, is that you?
- There, there.
You've been asleep for nearly six hours.
I had this horrible nightmare.
I dreamed I was in a Western.
I was being chased by all these Indians... and a bear.
You're safe and sound now here at the McFly farm.
"McFly farm"?
You're my...
You're my...
- Who are you?
- The name is Maggie McFly.
McFly?
Maggie?
And that's Mrs. McFly, and don't you be forgetting the "Mrs."
- What might your name be, sir?
- It's...
Eastwood.
Clint Eastwood.
You hit your head, Mr. Eastwood.
Not too serious, but lucky for you
Seamus found you when he did.
Seamus.
Me husband.
You'll be excusing me, while I tend to William.
William.
That's okay, Will.
- That's William?
- Aye.
William Sean McFly, the first of our family to be born in America.
It's okay, Will.
This here is Mr. Clint Eastwood visiting.
He sure likes you.
Maggie.
I've got supper.
I'm not one to pry into a man's personal affairs... but exactly how is it you came to be way out here... without a horse, or boots, or a hat?
Well, my... horse broke down and a bear ate my boots... and I just forgot my hat.
How could you forget a thing like your hat?
- Would you like some water?
- Yeah.
I'll tell you what I'll do, Mr. Eastwood.
I'll help you find your blacksmith friend.
You can stay the night in the barn...
and tomorrow I'll take you as far as the railroad tracks.
You can follow them straight into town.
I'll even give you a hat.
That's great. Thanks.
That's my William.
Wee Willy.
Yes.
I think you'll find the barn comfortable.
Never had any complaints about it from the pigs.
Seamus.
- A word with you.
- Aye.
Will you hold him for a minute?
Are you sure you're not bringing a curse on this house taking him in like that?
- He's such a strange young man.
- Aye, but I've just got a feeling about him.
Looking after him is the right thing to do.
That's important.
Hey, buddy.
Look how the baby takes to him.
Little Will never takes to strangers.
It's almost as if he's connected to us.
Hey, Will.
So you're my great-grandfather.
The first McFly born in America.
And you peed on me.
- Give us some soap.
- Here you go.
Take a look and see what just breezed in the door.
I didn't know the circus was in town.
Must have got that shirt off a dead Chinese.
What will it be, stranger?
I'll have...
- Ice water.
- Ice water?
Water?
You want water, you better dunk your head in the horse trough out there.
In here, we pour whiskey.
- Excuse me.
- For what?
I'm trying to find a blacksmith.
Hey, McFly!
Thought I told you never to come in...
You ain't Seamus McFly.
You look like him, though, especially with that dog-ugly hat.
You kin to that hay barber?
- What's your name, dude?
- Marty...
Eastwood.
Clint Eastwood.
- What kind of stupid name is that?
- He's the runt of the litter.
Boys, would you look-see at these pearly whites?
I ain't seen teeth that straight that weren't store-bought.
Take a gander at them moccasins.
What kind of skins is them?
- What's that writing mean?
- "Nike"? Is that Indian talk?
Bartender, I'm looking for that no-good, cheating blacksmith.
- You seen him?
- No, sir, Mr. Tannen. I have not.
Tannen.
You're Mad Dog Tannen.
"Mad Dog"?
I hate that name.
I hate it, you hear?
Nobody calls me "Mad Dog"!
Especially not some duded-up, egg-sucking gutter trash.
Dance! Come on!
Come on, runt!
You can dance better than that!
Shit.
- You better run, squirrel.
- Get him!
We got ourselves a new courthouse.
It's high time we had a hanging!
Look at him sway.
Yeah, haven't had a hanging in a long time!
I shoot the fleas off a dog's back at 500 yards, Tannen... and it's pointed at your head!
- You owe me money, blacksmith.
- How do you figure?
My horse threw a shoe.
You done the shoeing, so that makes you responsible.
Since you never paid me for the job,
I'd say that makes us even.
Wrong!
I was on my horse when it happened, and I got throwed off!
That caused me to bust a perfectly good bottle of fine Kentucky redeye.
The way I figure it, blacksmith, you owe me $5 for the whiskey... and $75 for the horse!
That's the $80.
If your horse threw a shoe, bring him back and I'll reshoe him.
I shot that horse!
- That's your problem, Tannen.
- Wrong. That's yours.
From now on, you better be looking behind you when you walk.
Because one day you're gonna get a bullet in your back.
Doc!
Marty, I gave you explicit instructions not to come here...
but to go directly back to 1985.
I know, but I had to come.
It's good to see you, Marty.
You've got to do something about those clothes.
- Dressed like that, you're liable to get shot.
- Or hanged.
What idiot dressed you in that outfit?
You did.
"Shot in the back by Buford Tannen over a matter of $80"?
"September 7"?
That's this Monday!
Now I wish I'd paid him off.
Who's this "beloved Clara"?
I don't know anyone named Clara.
I don't know, Doc.
I thought maybe she was a girlfriend of yours.
My involvement in such a social relationship... here in 1885...
could result in a disruption of the space-time continuum.
As a scientist...
I can never take that risk.
Certainly not after what we've already been through.
- Emmett! Hello, Emmett.
- Hubert.
It's the mayor.
Excuse me, Emmett.
Do you remember last week when you volunteered... to meet the new schoolteacher at the station?
Yes, quite so.
We just got word she's coming in tomorrow.
Here are the details for you.
- Thanks for all your help.
- Anytime, Hubert.
Oh!
Her name's Miss Clara Clayton.
Well, Doc... now we know who Clara is.
Marty, it's impossible.
The idea that I could fall in love at first sight is romantic nonsense.
There's no scientific rationale for that concept.
It's not science.
You meet the right girl, it hits you like lightning.
Please, don't say that.
That's the way it was for me and Jennifer.
We couldn't keep our eyes off each other.
God, Jennifer, I hope she's all right.
I can't believe we just left her on the porch.
Don't worry. She'll be fine.
When you burned the almanac in 1955, the normal timeline was restored.
Once we're back in 1985... you just have to go to her house to wake her up.
Turn that valve over there, all the way to the right.
Yeah, pull it all the way around.
Let's go!
- Ice tea?
- No, thanks.
It's a refrigerator.
I guess Miss Clayton will have to find other transportation.
If I never meet her, there's no possibility of a romantic infatuation.
- You're the doc.
- All right.
We'll get the DeLorean and get back to the future.
I tore a hole in the gas tank when I was landing... so we'll have to patch it up and get some gas.
You mean, we're out of gas?
Yeah. It's no big deal.
We've got Mr. Fusion, right?
Mr. Fusion powers the time circuits and the flux capacitor.
But the internal combustion engine runs on ordinary gasoline.
It always has.
There won't be a gas station around here until sometime in the next century.
Without gasoline, we can't get the DeLorean up to 88 mph.
So what do we do?
- Twenty-four!
- It's no use, Marty!
Even the fastest horse in the world won't run more than 35, 40 miles an hour!
Bartender said that's the strongest stuff they got.
Try it, Marty.
Give it more gas!
Damn!
It blew the fuel injection manifold.
Strong stuff, all right.
It will take me a month to rebuild it.
A month?
- You're gonna get shot on Monday!
- I know!
I wish...
Wait.
I've got it! We can roll it down a steep hill!
We'll never find a smooth enough surface.
Unless...
Of course! Ice!
We'll wait until winter when the lake freezes over.
Winter? What are you saying?
Monday is three days away!
All right. Let's just think this thing through logically.
We know it won't run under its own power.
We know we can't pull it.
But if we could figure out a way... to push it up to 88 miles an hour...
That's it.
How fast can she go?
Why, I've had her up to 55 myself.
I heard that Fearless Frank Fargo got one of these up to near 70... out past Verde Junction.
Do you think it's possible to get it up to 90?
Ninety? Tarnation.
Who would ever need to be in such a hurry?
Just a little bet he and
I have, that's all.
Theoretically speaking, could it be done?
I suppose, if you had a straight stretch of track with a level grade... and you weren't hauling no cars... and if you could get the fire hot enough.
I'm talking about hotter than the blazes of Hell itself.
It might be possible to get her up that fast.
When does the next train come through?
Monday morning at 8:00.
Here. This spur that runs off the main line 3 miles out to Clayton Ravine.
It's a long stretch of level track that will still exist in 1985.
This is where we'll push the DeLorean with the locomotive.
Funny. This map calls Clayton Ravine
"Shonash Ravine."
That must be the old Indian name for it.
It's perfect.
A long run that goes across the bridge over the ravine... over near that Hilldale housing development.
Right, but according to this map... there is no bridge.
Well, Doc, we can scratch that idea.
We can't wait for this thing to get finished.
Marty, it's perfect.
You're not thinking fourth dimensionally.
Right. I have a problem with that.
Don't you see? The bridge will exist in 1985.
It's safe and still in use.
As long as we get the DeLorean up to 88 miles an hour... before we hit the edge of the ravine... we'll instantaneously arrive at a point in time where the bridge is completed.
We'll have track under us and coast safely across the ravine.
- What about the train?
- It will be a spectacular wreck.
Too bad no one will be around to see it.
- Help me!
- Great Scott!
Hurry!
Jump!
Thank you, sir. You saved my... life.
Emmett Brown at your service, Miss...
Clayton.
Clara Clayton.
Clara?
What a beautiful name.
May I help you inside with these?
That won't be necessary.
I can take care of it.
- You've done more than enough already.
- But it's really no trouble.
She says it's fine, and we have to get going.
Ma'am, good luck with your school teaching and everything.
Clara.
I'll straighten everything out for the buckboard rental.
Don't worry about that. I feel somewhat responsible for what happened.
That would be very gentlemanly of you,
Mr. Brown. Emmett.
You know, I'm almost glad that snake spooked those horses.
Otherwise, we might never have met.
I suppose it was destiny.
Thank you for everything.
You're quite welcome.
I will see you again, won't I?
Of course. You'll see lots of me.
I have a shop in town.
I'm the local scientist,
I mean, blacksmith.
What sort of science?
Astronomy? Chemistry?
Actually, I'm a student of all sciences.
Doc, we have to get going.
Yes. Excuse us, Clara.
We have to get going.
Toodle-oo.
What do you mean, you'll be seeing lots of her?
I might see her again just in passing.
Did you see the way she was looking at you?
She did have quite a scare, right?
Miss Clayton almost ended up at the bottom of Clayton Ravine.
Holy shit.
Clayton Ravine was named after a teacher.
- They say she fell in there 100 years ago.
- 100 years ago!
- That's this year!
- Every kid knows that story.
We all have teachers we'd like to see fall into the ravine.
Great Scott!
Then she was supposed to go over in that wagon.
Now I may have seriously altered history.
Look, Doc, what's the worse that can happen?
So they don't name the ravine after her.
Let's get the DeLorean ready and get out of here.
I wish I'd never invented that infernal time machine.
It's caused nothing but disaster.
Doc, this is Marty.
Do you read me? Over.
Check, Marty.
Great. These things still work.
All right. Once more, let's go over the entire plan and layout.
- I apologize for the crudity of this model...
- Yeah, it's not to scale. It's okay.
All right. Tomorrow night, Sunday... we load the DeLorean onto the tracks here, on the spur...
by the abandoned silver mine.
The switch track is where the spur runs off the main line... three miles out to Clayton...
Shonash Ravine.
The train leaves the station at 8:00 Monday morning.
We'll stop it, uncouple the cars, throw the switch track and then hijack... borrow the locomotive and use it to push the time machine.
According to my calculations we'll reach
88 mph just before we hit... the edge of the ravine, at which point we'll be transported back to 1985... and coast safely across the completed bridge.
What does this mean? "Point of no return."
That's our fail-safe point.
Till there, we have time to stop the locomotive before it plunges into the ravine.
But once we pass this windmill, it's the future or bust.
Here you go.
Connect that to the positive terminal.
- All right, you all set?
- Yeah. Go!
Train pulling out of the station!
Coming up to the switch track!
Stop at the switch track!
Throw the switch!
Pull up to the DeLorean!
Pushing the DeLorean... up to 88 miles per hour!
It couldn't be simpler.
Emmett?
It's Clara.
Quick, cover the DeLorean!
- Hello.
- Why, hello.
This is quite a surprise.
I hope I'm not disturbing anything.
We were just doing a little model railroading.
When my bags were thrown from the wagon... my telescope was damaged.
Since you mentioned an interest in science...
I thought you might be able to repair it for me.
I would pay you, of course.
I wouldn't think of charging you for this.
Let's have a look at it.
I think a lens may be out of alignment because... if you move it this way the image turns fuzzy.
See?
But if you turn it the other way... then...
Everything becomes... clear.
I could repair it right away and have it for you tonight.
Tonight is the town festival.
I wouldn't dream of having you work on my telescope during such an occasion.
You are planning on attending, aren't you?
- Actually, ma'am...
- Yes, of course. The festival.
In that case,
I'll see you this evening at the festival.
- Mr. Eastwood.
- Ma'am.
Thank you for taking care of my telescope.
You're quite welcome.
It's a nice telescope.
Ladies and gentlemen... as mayor of Hill Valley... it gives me great pleasure to dedicate this clock... to the people of Hill County!
May it stand for all time!
Tell me when, gentlemen.
Three! Two! One!
Now!
Let the festivities begin!
In a way, it's fitting that you and I are here to witness this.
It's too bad I didn't bring my camera.
Ready, gentlemen?
The only problem is, we'll never be able to show it to anybody.
Smile, Doc.
What great music!
Yeah, it's got a beat, and you can dance to it.
Step right up and test your mettle with the latest products...
from Col. Samuel Colt's Patent
Firearms Manufacturing Company... of Hartford, Connecticut.
Now, take this model, for example.
The new, improved and refined Colt Peacemaker...
selling to you tonight for the low price of $12.
- Good evening.
- 'Evening.
You look very nice.
Thank you.
Would you like...
- Would you care to...
- I'd love to.
Young man, you want to give it a try?
No, thanks.
Doc, this...
Son!
- Sonny boy!
- Doc can dance?
Son.
I just told you that even a baby could handle this weapon.
- Surely you're not afraid to try.
- I'm not afraid of nothing.
Come on, then.
Just step up here like a man.
Now, young man, what you do is just ease that hammer back and... squeeze off a round.
Right on out there and be real smooth.
That's the way you do it.
- Can I try that again?
- Yeah, go ahead.
Tell me one thing.
Where did you learn to shoot like that?
7-Eleven.
Buford, you sure that blacksmith will be at this shindig?
Sure he's here. Everybody's here tonight.
You'll have to check your firearms if you want to join in on the festivities.
- Who's gonna make us, tenderfoot?
- I am.
Marshal Strickland.
I didn't know you was back in town.
If you can't read the sign,
I presume you can read this.
Pretty tough hombre when you're pointing a gun at a man's back.
Just like you, I take every advantage I can get.
You gonna check your iron?
I was just joking with your deputy.
Of course, I'm gonna check my iron.
- We all were, weren't we, boys?
- Yeah, right.
Tannen.
Your knife, too.
Smile, Marshal.
After all, this is a party.
Only party I'll be smiling at... is the one that sees you at the end of a rope.
Have fun!
That's how you handle them.
Never give them an inch... and maintain discipline at all times.
Discipline.
I will, Pa.
Thank you very much.
Mr. Eastwood, nice to see you.
I see you got yourself some respectable clothes and a fine hat.
A couple people didn't like the way the other one looked on me.
That one suits you.
- It's very becoming.
- Thanks.
"Frisbee." Far out.
- What was the meaning of that?
- It was right in front of him.
- That's mine!
- Not anymore.
- Give me that.
- There he is, Buford.
- Where?
- There.
Dancing with that piece of calico.
What are you gonna do, boss?
I figure if I bury this muzzle deep enough in his back nobody will hear the shot.
Careful. You've only got one bullet with that.
I only need one.
I told you to watch your back, smithy.
You're early.
It's a Derringer. Small but effective.
The last time I used it, fella took two days to die.
Bled to death inside. It was real painful.
That means you'll be dead by about supper time Monday.
Excuse me. I don't know who you think you are, but we're dancing.
Look what we have here.
Ain't you gonna introduce me?
I'd like a dance.
I wouldn't give you the pleasure.
You'll have to go ahead and shoot.
- All right.
- I'll dance with him.
Boys, keep the blacksmith company while I get acquainted with the filly!
Yeah!
I don't dance very well when my partner has a gun in his hand.
You'll learn.
Maybe I'll just take my $80 worth out of her!
Leave her alone!
Yeah, I bet there's something you can do that's worth $80.
I believe you've underestimated me, mister.
Have I?
Stop it!
Damn you!
No, I damn you!
I damn you to hell!
- You.
- Lighten up, jerk!
Mighty strong words, runt!
You man enough to back them up with more than just a pie plate?
Just leave my friends alone.
What's wrong, dude? You yellow?
That's what I thought. A yellow-belly.
Nobody calls me yellow.
Then let's finish it. Right now.
Not now, Buford. Marshal's got our guns.
Like I said, we'll finish this tomorrow!
Tomorrow we're robbing the Pine City stage.
What about Monday?
We doing anything Monday?
Monday would be fine.
You can kill him on Monday.
I'll be back this way on Monday.
We'll settle this then.
Right there, out in the street...
in front of the Palace Saloon.
Yeah, right. When?
- High noon?
- Noon?
I do my killing before breakfast. 7:00!
8:00. I do my killing after breakfast.
Marty!
Break it up.
What's all this about?
You causing trouble here, Tannen?
No trouble, Marshal.
Just a little personal matter between me and Eastwood.
This don't concern the law.
Tonight, everything concerns the law.
Break it up.
Any brawling, it's 15 days in the county jail.
All right, folks. This is a party.
Come on! Let's have some fun!
8:00 Monday, runt.
If you ain't here, I'll hunt you and shoot you down like a duck.
It's "dog." Shoot him down like a dog.
Let's go, boys!
Let these sissies have their party!
What are you doing, saying you'll meet Tannen?
Don't worry about it.
Monday morning we'll be gone.
Theoretically, yes. But what if the train's late?
- We'll discuss this later.
- We'll discuss it now.
- Thank you for your gallantry.
- Ma'am.
Had you not interceded,
Emmett might have been shot.
Marty... Clint, I'm gonna take Clara home.
- Right. Good night.
- You sure set him straight.
I'm glad somebody finally stood up to that son of a bitch.
You're all right in my book.
I'd like to buy you a drink.
You don't have to buy me anything.
It was no big deal...
You can have this brand-new Colt
Peacemaker and gun belt, free of charge.
Free?
I want everybody to know the gun that shot Buford Tannen... was a Colt Peacemaker!
No problem. Thanks a lot.
Of course, if you lose, I'm taking it back.
Thanks again.
You had him.
You could have walked away and nobody would have thought less of you.
All it would have been was words, hot air from a buffoon.
Instead, you let him rile you... into playing his game, his way, by his rules.
Seamus, relax. I know what I'm doing.
- He reminds me of poor Martin.
- Aye.
- Who?
- Me brother.
Wait a minute.
You have a brother named Martin McFly?
Had a brother.
Martin used to let men provoke him into fighting.
He was concerned people would think him a coward if he refused.
That's how he got a knife shoved through his belly in a saloon in Virginia City.
Never considered the future, poor Martin.
God rest his soul.
Sure, and I hope you're considering the future, Mr. Eastwood.
I think about it all the time.
That crater all by itself, like a starburst.
- Yeah.
- That one's called Copernicus.
Listen to me. I feel like
I'm teaching school.
Please, continue the lesson.
I never found lunar geography so fascinating.
You're quite knowledgeable.
When I was 11, I had diphtheria.
I was quarantined for three months.
My father brought this telescope and put it next to my bed...
so I could see everything out the window.
Do you think we'll ever travel to the moon... the way we travel across the country on trains?
Definitely. Although not for 84 years, and not on trains.
We'll have space capsules sent aloft with rockets... devices that create giant explosions so powerful they just...
That they break the pull of gravity and send the projectile to outer space.
Emmett!
I read that book, too!
You're quoting Jules Verne,
From the Earth to the Moon.
You've read Jules Verne?
- I adore Jules Verne.
- So do I.
20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.
My absolute favorite.
The first time I read that as a little boy,
I wanted to meet Captain Nemo.
Don't tease. You couldn't have read that when you were a boy.
It was only first published 10 years ago.
Yes. I meant it made me feel like a boy.
I never met a woman who liked Jules Verne before.
I never ever met a man like you before.
Doc?
Doc?
Hope you know what you're doing.
You talking to me?
You talking to me, Tannen?
I'm the only one here.
Go ahead! Make my day.
- Good morning.
- 'Morning.
Have a cigar. Anything I can do for you today?
- No, that's fine.
- Good luck tomorrow.
- We'll be praying for you.
- Thanks.
Good morning.
Interest you in a new suit for tomorrow?
I'm fine. Thanks.
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
I was just out enjoying the morning air.
It's really lovely here in the morning.
Don't you think?
Yes. We've got to load the DeLorean and get ready to roll.
Look at that, the tombstone.
Let me see that photograph again.
My name, it's vanished.
That's great, Doc.
We're going back to the future tomorrow, so everything's being erased.
But only my name is erased.
The tombstone itself and the date still remain.
That doesn't make sense.
We know this photograph represents what will happen... if the events of today continue to run their course into tomorrow.
- Right. So?
- Excuse me, Mr. Eastwood.
- I just need to take your measurements.
- Look, pal, I don't want to buy a suit.
- This is for your coffin.
- My coffin?
The odds are running 2-1 against you.
Might as well be prepared.
So it may not be my name... that's going to be on this tombstone.
It may be yours.
- Great Scott.
- I know, this is heavy.
Why are you wearing that gun? You're not considering going up against Tannen?
Tomorrow morning I'm going back to the future with you.
But if Buford Tannen comes looking for trouble, I'll be ready for him.
You heard what that son of a bitch called me.
You can't lose your judgment over names.
That's exactly what causes you to get in that accident in the future.
What? What about my future?
I can't tell you. It might make things worse.
Wait a minute.
What is wrong with my future?
We all have to make decisions that affect the course of our lives.
You've got to do what you've got to do... and I've got to do what I've got to do.
- Marty.
- Yeah?
I've made a decision.
I'm not going with you tomorrow.
I'm staying here.
What are you talking about?
There's no point in denying it.
- I'm in love with Clara.
- Oh, man.
We don't belong here.
Neither one of us.
It could still be you that gets shot tomorrow.
This tombstone could still be in your future.
Marty, the future isn't written.
It can be changed. You know that.
Anyone can make their future whatever they want it to be.
I can't let this one little photograph determine my entire destiny.
I have to live my life according to what I believe is right... in my heart.
Doc, you're a scientist.
So you tell me.
What's the right thing to do, up here?
You're right, Marty.
- That worked great.
- I've at least got to tell her good-bye.
Come on, Doc.
Think about it. What will you say to her?
"I've got to go back to the future"?
She won't understand that.
Hell, I'm in it with you, and I don't even understand it.
Doc.
Listen.
Maybe we...
Maybe we can just take Clara with us.
To the future?
As you reminded me, I'm a scientist, so I must be scientific about this.
I cautioned you about disrupting the continuum for your own benefit.
Therefore, I must do no less.
We shall proceed as planned, and as soon as we return to 1985... we'll destroy this infernal machine.
Traveling through time has become much too painful.
It's Emmett, Clara.
Emmett, won't you come in?
No, I better not. I...
What's wrong?
I've come to say good-bye.
Good-bye? Where are you going?
I'm going away.
I'm afraid I'll never see you again.
Emmett.
Clara, I want you to know that I care about you deeply.
But I've realized that I don't belong here, and I have to go back where I came from.
Where might that be?
I can't tell you.
Then wherever you're going, take me with you.
I can't, Clara.
I wish it didn't have to be this way... but believe me when I tell you that I'll never forget you... and that I love you.
I don't understand what you're trying to say.
Clara.
I don't think there's any way that you can understand it.
Please, I have to know.
If you sincerely do love me, then tell me the truth.
All right then.
I'm from the future.
I came here in a time machine that I invented... and tomorrow I have to go back to the year 1985.
Yes, Emmett.
I do understand.
I understand that because you know I'm partial to the writings of Jules Verne... you concocted those mendacities in order to take advantage of me.
I've heard some whoppers in my day... but the fact that you'd expect me to believe this... is so insulting and degrading!
All you had to say is, "I don't love you and I don't want to see you anymore."
That, at least, would have been respectful!
But that's not the truth.
Good to see you, too.
Emmett. What can I get you, the usual?
No, Chester, I'll need something a lot stronger than that tonight.
- Sarsaparilla.
- Whiskey, Chester.
Whiskey? Are you sure?
You know what happened to you on the Fourth of July.
Whiskey.
Okay, I ain't your papa.
Just don't want to see you do the wrong thing.
You can leave the bottle.
It's a woman, right?
I knew it. I've seen that look on a man's face... a thousand times all across the country.
All I can tell you, friend, is you'll get over her.
Clara was one in a million.
One in a billion. One in a googolplex.
The woman of my dreams, and I've lost her for all time.
I can assure you, sir, there are other women.
Peddling this barbed wire across the country... has taught me one thing for certain... it's that you never know what the future might bring.
The future. I can tell you about the future.
Man, did I sleep.
What time is it, Doc?
Doc!
Wake up!
Get up! Let's go!
I got me a runt to kill.
It's still early, boss. What's your hurry?
I'm hungry.
And in the future, we don't need horses.
We have motorized carriages called automobiles.
If everybody's got one of these auto whatsits... does anybody walk or run anymore?
Of course they run, but for recreation, for fun.
Run for fun?
What the hell kind of fun is that?
Doc!
How much has he had?
None. That's the first one, and he hasn't touched it yet.
He just likes to hold it.
Doc!
What are you doing?
I've lost her, Marty.
There's nothing left for me here.
That's why you gotta come back with me.
- Where?
- Back to the future!
- Right! Let's get going!
- Great.
Gentlemen, excuse me.
My friend and I have to catch a train.
Here's to you, blacksmith.
- And to the future.
- Amen.
- Amen.
- Emmett, no!
Doc!
Come on, Doc. Wake up! Wake up, Doc!
- How many did he have?
- Just the one.
- Just the one? Come on, Doc.
- There's a fellow that can't hold his liquor.
- Get me some black coffee!
- Joey, coffee!
Ma'am?
- How far does the 8:00 train go?
- San Francisco is the end of the line.
I'll take a one-way ticket.
To sober him up in a hurry, you need something a lot stronger than coffee.
What do you suggest?
Joey, let's make some wake-up juice.
Come on, Doc, swallow.
In about 10 minutes... he's gonna be as sober as a priest on Sunday.
Ten minutes!
Why do we cut these things so damn close?
Here, stick this clothespin on his nose.
When he opens up his mouth, go ahead and pour it on down his gullet.
Stand back.
- He's still out!
- That was just a reflex action.
It'll take a few more minutes for the stuff to clear up his head.
Perfect.
Come on, Doc. Wake up, buddy.
Wake up, Doc!
Seamus? Wouldn't expect to see you here this morning.
Aye. Something inside me told me
I should be here... as if my future had something to do with it.
He'll come around in a minute. Come on.
Come on, Doc. Let's go!
Let's wake up now, buddy.
Are you in there, Eastwood?
It's 8:00 and I'm calling you out.
It's not 8:00 yet!
It is by my watch!
Let's settle this once and for all, runt!
Or ain't you got the gumption?
Listen.
I'm not really feeling up to this today.
- So I'll have to forfeit.
- Forfeit?
What's that mean?
- It means that you win without a fight.
- Without shooting? He can't do that.
You can't do that!
You know what I think?
I think you ain't nothing but a gutless, yellow turd!
I'm giving you to the count of 10 to come out here and prove I'm wrong!
One!
Doc, come on, sober up, buddy.
- Two!
- You better get out there, son.
I got $20 gold bet on you, so don't let me down.
Three!
I got $30 gold bet against you, so don't let me down.
Four!
You better face up to it, son, because if you don't go out there...
- What?
- Five!
- What if I don't go out there?
- You're a coward.
Six!
And you'll be branded a coward for the rest of your days!
Everybody everywhere will say Clint Eastwood... is the biggest yellow-belly in the West!
Seven!
Here!
Eight!
I already got a gun.
Nine!
Ten!
Do you hear me, runt?
I said that's 10, you gutless, yellow pie-slinger!
He's an asshole!
I don't care what Tannen says!
I don't care what anybody else says either.
- Doc, you okay?
- I think so.
What a headache!
- You got a back door to this place?
- It's in the back.
Let's go.
Are you coming out here or do I have to come in after you?
The thing I really miss here is Tylenol.
Hey!
Reach, blacksmith!
Yes, sir, that poor fellow last night... had the worst case of broken heart
I have ever seen.
When he said he didn't know how he could live the rest of his life... knowing how much hurt he'd caused that little girl...
I really felt for him, I did, right here.
Listen up, Eastwood!
I aim to shoot somebody today, and I prefer it'd be you.
But if you're just too damn yellow... it'll just have to be your blacksmith friend.
Forget about me, Marty, and save yourself!
You got one minute to decide.
You hear me, runt? One minute!
I've never seen a man so broken up over a woman.
What did he say her name was?
Cara? Sara?
- Clara.
- Clara.
- Excuse me.
- Ma'am?
Was this man tall, with great big brown puppy-dog eyes... and long silvery, flowing hair?
You know him.
Emmett!
Time's up, runt!
Prepare to meet your maker, blacksmith.
Right here, Tannen!
Draw!
No!
I thought we could settle this like men.
You thought wrong, dude.
Thank you.
That was good.
You know what I think?
- I think Buford's going to jail.
- Yeah.
Get him out of that shit.
Get them!
Buford Tannen, you're under arrest for robbing the Pine City stage.
You got anything to say?
I hate manure.
Look!
Yes!
- The train!
- Can we make it?
We'll have to cut them off at Coyote Pass.
Hey, mister. Mr. Eastwood.
- Here's your gun, mister.
- Thanks, kid.
Seamus.
It's worth $12. Never been used.
- Maybe I'll trade it for a new hat.
- Right! Take care of that baby!
I will!
Emmett!
Emmett!
Emmett!
"Time machine."
Come on!
- Go!
- Give me your hand!
Come on!
Come on, Marty.
Come on. Let's go!
Masks on.
- Reach!
- Is this a holdup?
It's a science experiment.
Stop the train just before you hit the switch track up ahead.
- Doc!
- Uncouple the cars from the tender!
I've wanted to do that all my life.
What are these things?
My version of Presto Logs.
Compressed wood with anthracite dust... chemically treated to burn hotter and longer.
I use them so I don't have to stoke my forge.
These three will ignite sequentially... make the fire hotter, kick up the boiler pressure... and make the train go faster.
Ready to roll!
Emmett!
Marty, are the time circuits on?
Check!
Input the destination time:
October 27, 1985, 11:00 a.m.
Check. We're cruising at a steady 25 miles an hour.
I'm throwing in the Presto Logs.
The new dashboard gauge will tell us the boiler temperature.
It's color-coded to indicate when each log will fire.
Green, yellow and red.
Each detonation will be accompanied by a sudden burst of acceleration.
Hopefully we'll hit 88 miles per hour before the needle gets much past 2,000.
Why? What happens after it hits 2,000?
The whole boiler explodes!
Perfect!
- We just hit 35!
- Okay, Marty.
I'm coming aboard!
Emmett!
Come on.
You better hold onto something!
The yellow log is about to blow!
Golly.
We just passed 40!
Emmett!
We just passed 45! Go for it!
Fifty.
Emmett!
Clara!
I love you!
- What's happening?
- It's Clara! She's on the train!
Clara? Perfect.
She's in the cab! I'm going back for her!
The windmill!
Doc! We're going past 50!
You'll never make it!
Then we'll have to take her back with us!
Keep calling out the speed!
Clara, climb out here to me!
- I don't know if I can!
- You can do it!
Just don't look down!
That's it!
Sixty miles an hour!
You're doing fine! Nice and steady!
Come on!
- Just a little further!
- I can't! I'm scared!
- Seventy!
- Keep coming, Clara!
Come on! You're doing fine!
Come on! Nice and easy!
Don't look down! That's it!
You're doing fine!
The red log is about to blow!
Clara!
Emmett!
I'm trying to reach you!
- Clara, hold on!
- I can't!
I'll slip you the Hoverboard!
Marty, watch out!
Emmett, help!
Hold on!
Ready, Doc?
Catch it!
Yes!
Emmett!
Clara!
Well, Doc... it's destroyed.
Just like you wanted.
- Hey, butthead, get away...
- Watch it, Biff!
I didn't mean to scare you.
I didn't recognize you.
- What the hell are you doing?
- Just putting on the second coat.
You going cowboy?
Come on, guys. We'll be late for brunch.
Dad, they won't hold your reservations all day.
I can't find my glasses.
- Have you seen them?
- They're in your suede jacket.
Marty? What's wrong?
We thought you went to the lake.
- You wore that to the lake?
- Thank God you guys are back to normal.
Who are you supposed to be? Clint Eastwood?
Right. I have to go get Jennifer.
- I really like that hat.
- Thanks, Biff.
Jennifer.
Jen.
Jennifer.
Marty.
Marty!
I had the worst nightmare.
That dream I had is so real.
It was about the future.
About us.
And you got fired.
Wait a minute.
What do you mean, I got fired?
Hilldale.
Hilldale! This is where we live.
I mean, this is where we're going to live.
Someday.
It was a dream, wasn't it?
The big M.
- How's it hanging, McFly?
- Hey, Needles.
Nice set of wheels.
Let's see what she can do.
- Next green light.
- No, thanks.
What's the matter? Chicken?
- Marty, don't.
- Grab hold of something.
- Come on!
- Get on!
Yeah, go!
Did you do that on purpose?
Yeah. You think I'm stupid enough to race that asshole?
Jeez! I would have hit that Rolls-Royce.
It erased.
You're right. There's not much left.
Doc's never coming back.
I'll sure miss him, Jen.
What the hell?
- Doc!
- Marty!
- Doc!
- Marty!
It runs on steam!
Meet the family. Clara, you know.
- Hi, Marty!
- Ma'am!
These are our boys:
Jules and Verne.
Boys, this is Marty and Jennifer.
- Doc, I thought I'd never see you again.
- You can't keep a good scientist down.
I had to come back for Einstein... and I didn't want you to be worried about me.
I brought you a little souvenir.
It's great, Doc.
Thanks.
Dr. Brown, I brought this note back from the future... and now it's erased.
Of course it's erased.
What does that mean?
It means your future hasn't been written yet.
No one's has.
Your future is whatever you make it.
So make it a good one, both of you.
We will, Doc!
Stand back!
All right, boys, buckle up!
Where are you going now?
Back to the future?
No. Already been there.
Who wants to be measured first?
-Me. I do.
-Okay, get up here.
Okay, wait a second.
No, she's got to turn around.
Let Daddy show you how it's done.
Then I'm going to lie down.
See, shoes off.
Heels against the wall.
Feet together, head level.
-All right.
-Go ahead.
Okay. And 5'1 1 and three quarters.
What? No, I'm 6 feet tall.
-Me next.
-Not yet. Wait, Ally.
Let Daddy do it. Do it again.
-Okay, 5'1 1 and three quarters.
-No!
It says 5'11 and three quarters.
You can't tell on a giraffe.
I'm 6 feet tall, everybody.
Ray Barone. Black hair, brown eyes, 6 feet tall.
People say, "Who are you?"
I'm 6 feet tall. That's who I am.
All right. And...
-5'11 and three quarters.
-Come on.
That's what it says. Look, 5'1 1 and three--
All right. What, you like saying it?
You don't have to get so upset about it.
Guys care about height, you know?
Just like women care about weight.
I don't care about weight.
Yeah, you don't 'cause you only weigh about, what, 1 40?
See? Don't get on your high horse if you can't take the smell.
Ray, I'm sorry about your height.
I still love you, okay?
The kids love you. Don't you, kids?
See?
I'm 6 feet tall.
Honey, maybe you were 6 feet tall, but you just shrunk a little bit.
What do you mean, shrunk?
That happens, you know?
As you get older, people tend to just....
Shrink?
-It's not a big deal. It happens to everyone.
-I'm shrinking now?
Ray, don't get all, you know....
-Oh, my God. I'm shrinking.
-Ray!
Mommy is not 1 40.
Man, so close!
Listen up, everybody.
I've got an announcement to make.
I suck and I quit.
You only blew the game-winning shot, what's the big deal?
Yeah, there'll be other game-winning shots.
Hopefully, you won't take them.
Look, isn't it obvious?
I'm too short to play this game.
What?
I measured myself yesterday, and I'm a quarter-inch shorter than last year.
Ray, you could shrink a foot and still not be the shortest guy on the team.
You could lose a leg and still not be the slowest.
Don't you see? I'm going to keep shrinking.
Relax, Ray, you weren't that good to begin with.
Raymond.
Sounds like you're having a little mid-life crisis.
What?
No, God. Mid-life crisis.
I don't want one of those.
I do. I can't wait for mine.
I 'm going to get a Harley and a girl who's impressed by Harleys.
Debra won't let me have either of those.
No, that's not the problem.
Come here, Rayleigh.
You're worried that you're not going to accomplish... everything you set out to do in life.
-I am?
-Who knows?
But I went to this self-improvement seminar to meet women... and I learned that people with goals don't worry so much about getting old.
-Did you meet anyone?
-No one.
Apparently, I don't appeal to women with goals.
You know what I always wanted to do?
Run the New York Marathon.
-Come on, for real?
-Yeah, real.
Guys, what is with all this dream crap?
Why don't you go home, hug your fathers, and maybe we'll win a game.
You should do what they made us do at the seminar.
You make a list of the 1 00 things you want to do before you die.
-I can come up with, like, four.
Easy.
You just think of the stuff that you want in your life that you don't have.
Look, I don't need any of that, all right?
All I need is another quarter-inch.
Who doesn't?
Yeah. You are correct there.
You're right on the money.
"Things to do before I die."
It's personal, okay?
Like you have your feminine products.
Is this about you shrinking?
Maybe a little.
Look, the guys... thought that the reason the shrinking thing is bothering me... is 'cause I'm having a mid-life crisis.
Yeah, and I need some goals, you know?
Something to shoot for.
You want to have an affair?
-What? Where did that come from?
-Well, how come you won't show me?
Yeah. I put "have an affair" on paper.
That's one of my goals.
Disappoint another woman.
Yeah, I get it.
Look, just give me the List, all right?
I just want to see it.
Look, just keep in mind, it's not really done yet.
"Peking duck, goat cheese pizza."
What is this?
I told you, it's goals and stuff.
These are your goals?
These are restaurant specials.
I've never had the Peking duck.
So your goal is just to eat things you've never eaten before.
Not entirely.
"Enlarged prostate."
See? That's something that I want to avoid.
Not something I wish to eat.
-What?
-I see.
-What? What are you--
-Well, Ray, come on. You're a writer.
Don't you want to do something like write the great American novel or....
I thought about that, and then I thought...
I don't even want to read the great American novel.
Well, there has to be something else you want to do besides:
"never throw up again."
No. That's it, see?
I got nothing. I got no dreams.
Ray, everybody has dreams.
Yeah? What do you have?
What's on your list?
-Me?
-Yeah.
Well, I just thought that after the kids grow up, it might be nice... if, I don't know, we moved upstate... and opened a little bed-and-breakfast somewhere.
Whoa. Bed-and-breakfast?
What do you mean, like, strangers coming in and out of our house all the time?
Yes, Ray, strangers.
I'd like to try strangers for a change.
I don't know. This is all happening too fast.
We don't have to do it today, Ray.
I'm just trying to get you thinking.
I'm thinking I'd better come up with something... before I end up with your bed-and-breakfast... tucking in a gay couple from Cleveland.
All right.
You know what?
Maybe the reason that you can't come up with any goals for yourself... is that, in your own Ray way... you're actually content.
Where are you picking up that vibe?
Look at the facts.
You have a great job, a wonderful family... a loving wife who weighs nowhere near 1 40.
Yeah, so what are you saying?
I think maybe you've already accomplished more than you've ever dreamed of.
You really think so?
I do. Maybe you're one of the lucky people who's actually living his dream.
-Wow.
-Yeah. See? You feel better?
-What? What, Ray?
-I'm thinking... if what you said is true, and I've already done everything... then I guess this is all there is.
Hey.
Good morning, Raymond. Want some eggs?
No, thanks.
Listen, I want to ask you guys something.
When I was a kid, do you remember me having a dream?
I remember you wetting the bed.
No, I don't mean that.
I mean, like, what did I want to be?
Dry.
Morning.
How many eggs, Robbie?
Three. Today I'd like them raw, in a glass.
What?
I'm in training. Going to be running the New York Marathon this year.
-Come on. You're really going to do that?
-That's right.
Marathon, huh?
Put me down for a buck a mile.
You don't pledge for this one, Dad.
I'm not pledging, I'm betting.
I say you'll cry like a Little girl by mile two.
Ray, you want some of this action?
-Look, at least he's got a dream, right?
-Are you making fun, too?
No, I'm actually jealous.
You have a dream. I've got nothing.
Nothing?
-You've got nothing?
-What?
House, wife...
Little daughter, twin boys.
That's nothing to you?
That was my dream!
Hello!
So why don't you go take your little mid-life...
"I'm shrinking, I'm dying,
I don't have any dreams"... and go right back across the street to paradise.
Look, you don't understand--
Yeah, I don't understand.
Just go, because I'm going to tell you something. I have....
Are you all right, Robert?
Yeah, fine, Ma, I'm fine.
What? What do you....
Put the--
Guess I'm just going to have to scratch dream number two off my List.
Go ahead and cook those eggs, Ma.
I should have put my money on warm-up.
Raymond, why didn't you tell us you were having a mid-life crisis?
The announcements are still being printed, Ma.
Here, sit down, have some eggs.
You know what I always wanted to do, Ray?
Sing like Tony Bennett.
Tony Bennett?
That's right. But look at me.
Am I Tony Bennett?
No.
You see, you do a thing, and that's what you are.
One guy lives in Brooklyn.
One guy lives in Sutton Place.
Another guy's a lawyer, one guy is a doctor.
Another guy dies, another guy gets well, people are born--
What the hell are you talking about?
Don't worry so much. You die.
You did what you did.
Stop saying "die."
It's obvious Raymond's afraid of dying.
What am I supposed to tell him? That it's not going to happen? It's going to happen.
You're going to die!
Thank you, Dad.
There you go.
Now, Raymond, you know, we are all afraid of death.
But the important thing is to be ready.
See, your father and I have all we need, right in here.
We have our will and our insurance... and the deed to our burial plot.
Where's the permit to the neighbors' parade?
-Frank, what is this?
-What?
Our joint burial plot. It only mentions one.
Where's the other plot?
What, who cares? I sold it.
You sold half of our joint burial plot?
The people next door had an unexpected death.
They were very upset.
I got twice what I paid for it.
It wasn't yours to sell.
I sold my half of the plot.
How do you know it wasn't my half, Frank?
I always sleep on the left.
And when were you going to tell me about this?
I wasn't.
I figured if you went first, you couldn¡¯t yell at me.
And if I went first, yell all you want.
You have always wanted to leave me, haven't you?
Till death do us part, Marie.
After that you're on your own.
Why don't you fulfill one of my dreams, and leave me alone now?
Holy crap!
We found something we have in common.
How bad can death be?
-Hey, cornflake.
-Hi.
In a good mood, huh?
Yeah, I did a lot of productive thinking today.
-Yeah?
-Going to be cremated.
What?
Yeah, I think it just makes sense, you know?
More sense than burial.
I'm not all that gung ho about decomposing.
How did you get onto this?
Look, it pays to think about these things.
Hey, don't be like that, either.
I don't want a big, sad funeral.
You know, make it like a celebration.
People telling stories, funny anecdotes about me. Like a roast.
What is wrong with you?
Good news.
I found a cemetery that can fit us all in.
Misery, your company's here.
It's beautiful.
But it may be a Little tight.
One of us has to be vertical.
I don't know, Ma.
I'm thinking of going cremation.
Oh, you want to go off on your own, too?
This family is falling apart.
-This does look nice, though.
-See?
Debra, would you mind being the vertical one?
Why Debra, Ma?
It can't be your brother, his head would stick out of the ground.
Hey, how about a wood chipper?
Then we could all fit into one big trash bag.
That's morbid, dear.
Yes.
Deb, you should look at this.
It's pretty good.
You're going to die, you know.
I know you're not excited about spending eternity with my parents... but it's not going to be like now, when all they have to do is cross the street.
I mean, they're going to have to bust out of their coffins... and tunnel through the dirt... just to get to our coffin.
And then they're banging and....
-We could pretend we're not even there.
-Shut up! Stop it!
Stop talking about coffins.
So you want to do cremation with me?
Ray, you're supposed to be having a mid-Life crisis, not an end-of-life crisis.
Look, don't tell me how to have a mid-life crisis, okay?
-What would you know about it?
-Because I've already had mine.
Really?
Yes, a while ago.
Was that the perm?
-No.
-'Cause that didn't look good.
It was two years ago.
You never acted like you were having a mid-life crisis.
Ray, look at me.
I'm rubbing cream on my hands.
Do you know why
I'm rubbing cream on my hands?
Because it's hand cream?
No, because my skin isn't as soft and smooth as it used to be. Have you noticed?
-I didn't want to say anything--
-Shut up, Ray.
That is why every night I take this cream... and desperately try to turn back the clock.
And even though I know it's a losing battle,
I still do it anyway.
That is how you have a proper mid-life crisis.
You do not start planning your death.
You go into denial like a normal person.
-Give me your shoes.
-What?
All right, but I think my shoes are soft enough.
Just give them to me.
When you started going all nuts about the height thing...
I bought these as a joke.
But now I think they're actually going to help.
So stick these on.
Come on. These aren't going to do anything.
You want to be 6 feet tall? Put them on.
I'm not wearing lifts.
They're not Lifts.
They're extra-thick Odor-Eaters.
Two birds with one stone.
Look, this doesn't really mean I'm 6 feet tall.
Hey, this cream doesn't mean my hands are any softer than they used to be.
I don't know.
I'm talking about death, here, okay?
You really think some cheap insoles are going to change my outlook....
These are kind of bouncy.
Little spring in your step there, young man?
Yeah, whatever. Come on, who am I really fooling here?
You've only got to fool one person.
And if I recall, that person once asked me if Jell-O was a fruit.
Yeah.
Listen, you do whatever you need to do.
As for me, I'm going to put these tea bags on my puffy eyes... and dream about my bed-and-breakfast by the lake.
Good night.
Hey, can you put these in sneakers?
Put them anywhere you want.
Feeling tall and smelling good.
Idiot.
Frank, you want your ice cream or not?
He's not here, Ma.
Where did he go?
I don't know. He said Ray got him thinking.
Ray got him thinking?
Yeah, you believe that?
About what?
I left my heart in San Francisco
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
My wife thinks I'm in the bathroom.
High on a hill
It calls to me jojoba yettoreturn@hotmail.com
Give me more!
Come on, honey, get it all off!
Come on, let me stand up for queen and country.
Come on, show us what you got!
Come on, honey, all of it!
There you go, all of it!
And the dress!
Come on, babe!
If one more person calls me "babe"...
Mr. Santos, your package has arrived.
- My special order?
- Under lock and key.
- What about the new dancer?
- Who?
The blonde with the guns.
If she's more to your pleasing, it's her first night, and I haven't had a chance to feel her out.
But you'll be very pleased with the special order.
She's as tender as Tuscan veal.
How's the crowd, honey?
Wet!
- Come again?
- She's Chinese.
Very well done.
They loved you.
I'd like to talk to you... about coming back.
In my office.
I'll be waiting for you.
Sure thing, big boy.
What are you doing here?
Looking for a light.
Got one?
I don't smoke.
Neither do I.
Who are you?
I'm the one who's getting you out of here. Trust me.
- Right this way, Mr. Santos.
- Shit! Come on.
Go!
Minka.
- What are you doing?
- Ever seen "Batman"?
No, I can't.
No!
No!
Shut up!
Goddamn it!
Here's your little pride and joy.
Thank you.
Thank you from the bottom of our hearts.
We thought we'd never see our little girl again.
Thank you.
Cut the shit! Where's my money?
Honey, pay this woman.
I'm afraid there's been a slight problem.
I could only come up with half the money.
Half the money?
- Fine... I'll take half your daughter.
- Wait.
I'm sure, we can negotiate something.
The car plus the cash...
Not a bad night's work.
It was the middle of the second American Civil War.
The world had gone to hell.
The year was 2017, the worst year of my life.
There was only one free city:
And that's where I lived for three years... port Steel Harbor.
What a shithole!
Why don't we start again?
From the beginning.
I told you...
I told you everything I know.
I told you.
Line's cleared up on screen one,
Colonel.
Image is present.
Image is recording.
Citizen, I... I abhor torture.
But your words just don't match your thoughts.
There are too many details that you're just not sharing.
Our little mind-reading device doesn't lie.
Reset sensors.
Now, where's doctor Corrina Devonshire?
No! No!
She's going to Steel Harbor, the free city.
Can you tell me, why Cora D. is going to Steel Harbor?
She's meeting members of the resistance.
They're giving her the retinal lenses.
Helping her out of the country.
To Canada.
She's with a freedom fighter... named Axel.
Who has the retinal lenses now?
Krebs.
William Krebs.
How are they getting her into the city?
She's had plastic surgery.
Her face is changed.
You won't recognize her.
- You'll never find her.
- You're so beautiful.
I'm sorry.
Colonel Pryzer,
Executive Council on line two.
Tell him to hold.
Put him on.
Colonel Pryzer... any word yet on our traitorous doctor, Cora D.?
I'm not gonna pander to that mythic name bullshit.
Doctor Devonshire still poses quite a problem to the Congressionals.
Her escape may jeopardize our strongest defensive action yet.
I'm fully aware of that, citizen.
Doctor Devonshire was privy to some of the most sensitive military secrets.
Her DNA holds the antidote to our greatest biochemical weapon.
She must be captured alive at any cost.
I'll take care of your problem.
I'll get my hands dirty for you again.
I wouldn't be cleaning up your mess
<iconv() failed>
Well, I...
I had no direct knowledge of that operation.
Of course, it was a vital part of our contract to...
Save it for the U.N.
Doctor Corrina Devonshire, Cora D., whatever she calls herself, it really doesn't matter...
She belongs to me.
She's connecting with a resistance contact named Krebs.
He has the lenses and will be helping her leave the Congressional territories.
They're meeting in the free city,
Steel Harbor.
I'll contact their local authorities immediately.
You see, I do my homework, citizen.
It's them. Let's go.
- Which one of you is Krebs?
- We meet him later.
Hurry.
I said, get to the back of the line!
- I'll take those weapons.
- Don't lose the clip.
Don't worry about it.
Dry martinis and a Cuban cigar.
You got it.
Bubbly on the house!
Please, leave it out.
Excuse me. Curly!
I'm still waiting to hear from Miss Wire.
I conveyed your offer to her.
1500 Dollars to chop off the legs of your ex-partner.
You must be joking.
Naturally she declined.
Miss Wire doesn't accept this kind of job.
Please!
What?
My money's not good enough for her?
I will make my offer in person!
- If I were you, I wouldn't do that.
- Why?
Her private secretary Camille doesn't have you in her appointment book.
- And she can be very mean.
- Let me through.
- You see?
- Time for a couple of dedications.
To Bobby from Colleen... The test came back and everything's cool.
And from Samantha to Cal...
"You thieving murderous bastard!
If I ever see you again, I'll rip out your eyes and pluck off your ears."
Damn, if that just don't thug at my heart strings.
Now, here's a little rhythm for you heartsick boys and girls.
Chanel No. 5. Am I correct?
Yes, you are.
When I smelled it,
I thought to myself...
"Charlie, now this is obviously a woman of significant breeding."
And then I thought...
"I wonder if she'd like to do some?"
Breeding, that is. What do you think about that, sweetheart?
Who are you talking to?
Some chick.
Where's your mercurial sister?
Why don't you try the office?
And when you see her, tell her I only had two.
Okay, whatever you say, Charlie.
That's my boy.
Goddamn. Customs police.
Stay put. We'll handle this.
Where's your ID?
- Something feels wrong.
- This is making me very nervous.
Look, we just stick with the plan, okay?
Change of plans! Let's go!
Shit!
Find them now!
Sorry, boss. Is this a good moment to talk about the payroll?
- No.
- Tonight's fan mail.
Three offers to sell black market dollars...
Another offer to buy the bar...
An urgent request to contact the resistance, and a badly-scented proposal of marriage.
No more valentines, Curly.
Oh, it's awful.
Look, boss, I hate to keep bringing this up, I really do.
But tomorrow's payday.
What am I going to use for money, a smile?
Relax, Curly, I got it covered.
- Are we going out?
- For a while.
Just how far out are we going to go?
I want to get some air.
But I thought you got some air last night?
That didn't happen.
This isn't happening either.
Anybody asks,
I'm taking a bubble bath.
Barb, I just don't like...
Keep Charlie out from under the tables. It's embarrassing.
I will.
Sweet dreams.
Okay. Okay, let's go.
Now what?
We find Krebs.
Any bright ideas how?
Just one.
I had to do a little moonlighting to keep my bar running.
Not an easy life. A girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do.
And in this world you gotta use everything you got.
Hey, handsome, you want some company?
You a cop?
See a badge?
You got your Med-Reg?
Full medical, checked yesterday.
- How much is this gonna cost me?
- That depends on how you wanna play.
- I like to play rough.
- Me too.
Hey, nice nuts!
Get a life!
Apartment four, seven, two...
One guest.
Retinal scan verified:
Ruben Tannenbaum, one, zero, eight, one, one.
How romantic!
I have an idea.
Why don't you go change into something more comfortable?
How about something a little less comfortable?
I can hardly wait.
Bingo! Mr. Krebs.
Did you wash your hands?
No.
I was bad.
I'm so glad to hear that.
Now, close your eyes and turn around.
What the hell?
I wouldn't do that if I were you, Krebs.
Come on, move your ass!
Shit!
Go ahead, go!
- You're not going soft on me, are you?
- Okay.
You can have him.
Good.
You're my last bail jumper, Krebs.
Wake up, sunshine.
- Please don't kill me.
- That was nice kicking.
You really know your stuff, babe.
What did you call me?
Don't call me babe!
Goddamn it!
Ah, Mr. Krebs.
It's a pleasure to see you.
You know, we were getting very concerned.
And Barb... it's a pleasure to see you too.
You're looking rather buoyant this evening.
Shut up! My fee?
- No!
The price went up for this one,
Schmitz.
- We had an agreement.
- You told me he was alone and unarmed.
- He wasn't.
- Sorry.
How could I know that? Bounty hunting is an ugly, unpredictable business.
You of all people should know that.
How much?
Canadian.
Miss Wire.
I do believe that I'm being extorted here!
As a duly authorized officer of the court, I must protest!
Look at it this way, Schmitz:
Alive, Krebs represents your investment in this bail bond.
Dead, he's toxic waste.
Canadian, now!
It's a pleasure doing business with you, Barb.
If it was a pleasure, I'd charge more.
- Everything go okay?
- Candy from a baby.
- Pay the help, for God's sake.
- Please, not in public.
Excuse me, Miss Wire? I... I...
I'm going back to the front lines tomorrow, and I was wondering...
You look beautiful. Would...
Would you dance with me?
Come on, Barb, give him a thrill.
Come on.
I can't believe, I'm actually dancing with the Barb Wire!
Where are you from, soldier?
Steamboat Springs, Colorado, or what's left of it.
Did you hear, the Congressionals just took over Denver?
No, I didn't.
Do you have a girl back home?
Yeah.
- Do you miss her?
- Yes, ma'am, every day.
I tell you what: close your eyes and let's pretend she's right here in your arms.
Yes, ma'am.
Everyone, stay where you are!
This is the police.
Willis,
Steel Harbor's Chief of Police.
He was a drunk with sticky fingers.
But at least, he was honest.
He admitted, he was a liar and a thief.
- Check his ID.
- Yes, sir.
Retinal scan verified:
Lawrence Crabtree, five, seven, two, three, nine.
Ben Jones, eh?
Arrest him.
Good luck, soldier.
- Next.
- Right, get over.
- Retinal scan verified: Martha Berg.
- Arrest her.
- Willis, what the hell is going on?
- Barb, how lovely to see you.
What gives?
It's a messy business tonight.
Most unpleasant: a rather spectacular double homicide in the old harbor.
- So?
- So, we're checking a few IDs.
We have reason to believe, this might have been resistance-related.
As your bar is non-discriminating to this town's more nefarious side...
- How long is this gonna take?
- Everything's negotiable.
- Curly...
- Music!
You really upgraded this place from what it was, Barb.
I like the new sound system.
Sounds expensive.
- I've been saving my lunch money.
- Didn't know you opened for lunch.
Now, a little gun running here, some bail jumping there, the occasional midnight detonation:
Those are the kind of jobs that pay for new toys.
- I don't moonlight.
- I do.
- It's profitable.
- What's with the bullshit arrests?
You sold half those
Congressional IDs yourself.
Moi? Bullshit arrests?
Two of my men are dead.
Now granted, they were homicidal thugs, but they were my men.
What makes you think resistance was involved?
Why? Do you have any other information I should know about?
Of course not.
Of course not.
That's sexual harassment, Chief.
Listen, Barbara Kopetsky, we can play this cat and mouse game all night long.
But I have more important things on my mind.
Now, where the hell is William Krebs?
Never heard of him.
Why are your men watching him?
That's classified police business.
I can tell you he was resistance and the Congressionals have a million dollar bounty on his head.
So if someone knew where Krebs was,
I can make it worth their while.
Goodbye, Willis.
Okay.
By the way, we're expecting some distinguished visitors tomorrow.
A Congressional delegation out of Washington including First Directorate,
Colonel Victor Pryzer.
- Might bring them by the Hammerhead.
- Their money will be welcome.
You don't know Victor Pryzer.
Speaking of money, I don't have to make more arrests for the usual 3000.
I better go downstairs checking some more IDs.
- Two grand.
- Darling.
- 30 bucks for the cognac.
- Add it to my tab, Miss Kopetski.
Miss Kopetski died in the war.
I'm Barb Wire.
Some cigarettes and a drink, then I'll be fine.
Give me a goddamn drink!
You, you or you!
Just give me my drink!
- Sir, we're not open yet.
- You've had enough already.
Blow me!
Camille... package check.
Get her off of me!
That's Camille. She works here.
Camille, sit.
- You don't wanna see her roll over.
- No, no, no.
Good. Camille, outside.
- Have a nice day.
- Yes, ma'am.
Willis, what's with the monkey suit?
You know how uniforms impress the Congressionals.
The delegation arrived this morning.
Look lively.
They could be here any minute.
Excuse me, Barb.
- My table?
- Best in the house, as you requested.
Just keep them away from the weapons check.
We don't want our customers from the United Front trying to get even.
I think you'll find our guests from Washington command more respect.
You're confusing respect with fear.
Speak of the devil.
They are punctual,
I'll give them that.
You'll join us for a drink later.
On my tab, of course.
Fat chance!
Colonel Pryzer. Alexander Willis,
Director of Police Operations.
Welcome to Steel Harbor.
Wipe that smile off your face, Willis.
This burnt-out hellhole is the last place on earth I want to be!
If it wasn't for your almost complete incompetence,
I wouldn't be here in the first place, would I?
Yes. Needless to say, we had intended to have both Krebs and Cora D. sent to Washington by now.
However, due to circumstances outside of our control...
Listen... carefully!
If Cora D. escapes,
I will personally rip your heart out of your ass and stuff it back down your throat!
That's not very sanitary.
Baby, you tell me it's late, but
I tell you, it only feels that way.
So sit back and enjoy someone or something elicit, if you can get it, and listen to the music.
Gentlemen, the steaks are excellent tonight.
Colonel Pryzer, allow me to introduce our hostess, the inimitable...
Even in Washington... we've heard of Barb Wire.
I hope you'll join us.
You attract a very eclectic crowd.
It looks that way.
Rumor has it you used to fight with the resistance?
Shouldn't believe everything you hear.
- I'm neutral. I'm a business woman.
- Perhaps we can do business.
I can assure you, Barb has a very keen sense of commerce.
Then I'll get to the point.
There's a fugitive, a traitor, in Steel Harbor.
She intends to make a crossing into Canada with the help of some more disenchanted members.
Do I look disenchanted to you?
Your business dealings bring you in contact with all levels of society.
I thought you were getting to the point.
Her name is doctor Corrina Devonshire.
You may have heard of her as Cora D.
One of those overly romanticized resistance names.
It keeps her legend alive.
- What does she look like?
- We're not sure.
She had her appearance surgically altered.
These are photos of her before.
It's hard to find somebody unless you know what she looks like.
Her present appearance is of no consequence.
Identification can always be made by retinal scanning.
So?
The Congressionals can count on your assistance?
Excuse me, boss.
Trouble in the kitchen. I need you.
Excuse me, gentlemen,
I have a bar to run.
- Very interesting woman.
- With most impressive assets.
Gentlemen... There you are, sir.
Act natural?
That's easier said than done.
Two beers, buddy. I'm looking for a Barb or Charlie Kopetski.
Barb is out there.
The Congressionals!
- They have my photographs.
- Let's hope resistance are here.
- They are looking everywhere for you.
- Who are we meeting?
Someone I used to know.
Wait here.
Hello, Charlie.
This must be a post-traumatic stress flashback.
I could swear I just heard an old voice from the battle fields.
Surprised to see me?
Do I look surprised?
Guess you didn't hear.
A Congressional smart grenade.
It followed me to my foxhole.
I thought I'd dug it deep enough.
I guess I didn't.
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.
Me too.
Miss, two bourbons.
You don't have to buy me a drink,
Axel.
I'm tight with the management here.
You got a lot of nerve coming in here.
I had no choice.
Where's Barb?
I don't think talking to Barb is such a good idea.
She took Seattle a hell of a lot harder than I did.
I need her help. I need her to put us in touch with local resistance.
Haven't you heard?
Barb's retired.
Leave. Now. Before Barb sees you.
There's no telling what she might do.
Too late.
Three,
- Two...
- Hello, Barb.
One!
- Okay, I guess I deserved that.
- Get out!
- I need your help.
- Rot in hell!
I remember when you believed in something.
I remember how it felt, like I was kicked in the stomach.
I've got 24 hours to find a man named Krebs.
I don't know how I feel.
I don't feel much of anything anymore.
- Will you just trust me please?
- Like I did in Seattle?
What happened there isn't what you think. I never wanted to hurt you.
- Now is not the time to explain.
- You're three years late.
Get out and don't come back!
Your check, sir.
Such blatant disregard for money.
Thank you for your hospitality.
And I do hope you'll think about our offer.
I'm thinking about it.
I knew I shouldn't have come here.
That woman's in love with you.
There's a lot of things
I need to tell you.
- I hope it's sooner than later.
- Axel, over here!
Charlie.
I can help.
The blind leading the blind.
Go to the old factory district to a place called Steel Harbor Metal House.
It's a front for the resistance.
There's a stairway in the back, near the loading dock.
Watch yourself.
Shit!
Who are you?
Charlie Kopetski sent us.
Doesn't matter who I am but this is Cora D.
Scan her.
Retinal scan verified: doctor Corrina Devonshire, four, four, seven, nine, one.
Cora D., I'm honored.
We've been looking for you. I never thought I'd meet the legend in person.
I'm commander here.
They call me Spike.
- You're so young.
- Maybe.
- But I'm tough.
- Well, we're glad we found you.
We hope that you can help us, Spike.
It took us a while but we found Krebs.
The lenses are gone, not to mention his eyeballs.
We found him in an abandoned washing machine behind the old V.A. hospital.
- The Congressionals took the lenses?
- No.
They're still looking for Krebs, we know that.
Willis and the cops don't know squat.
Everybody's chasing their tail.
Who's got the contact lenses now?
Word on the street is Krebs was turned over to a bail bondsman named Schmitz.
Schmitz was aiming to turn Krebs over to the Congressionals for the bounty.
- But then they got wise to the lenses.
- They are worth two million.
Without them I won't be able to get past the scan and get on that plane.
- Let's not wait. Let's get Schmitz!
- It's not that easy, doc.
- We can't find him.
- The plane leaves in 24 hours.
Somebody must help us.
Only one person at Steel Harbor has connections on all sides.
If anyone would know where Schmitz is, she would.
The trouble is, she won't help nobody for free and we're a little low on cash.
You know I do, Connie.
Don't make me say it.
I love you. Bye.
- What are you two laughing at?
- Who was that?
- Your mother.
- Give me three.
How many?
Put that down!
- How many more?
- Give me two.
- Your bet, Moe.
- I'll bet, when I get ready.
Just wait.
Ten-hut!
Don't know how you do things in Washington, but I do make the occasional arrest without slaughter.
You incompetent.
We needed to make an interrogation.
Sorry, sir, they resisted.
Is any of these men Schmitz?
No.
Look who's here.
Krebs.
Cora D. can't be far.
I'll need one of the bodies.
Preferably... one without a head wound.
- Hey. You want some company?
- No.
Okay. Do you want some advice?
No!
Okay.
Drink when you want to remember.
Don't drink when you want to forget.
I'll be there.
I promise.
Let's move!
- Barb, we have to go now!
- No, he'll be here!
Barb!
Axel!
Are you Barbara Kopetski?
- Yes. Where's Axel?
- He's not here. He's not coming.
He said he's sorry but you gotta get out of here.
You guys gotta get out of here!
Go! Go! Go!
That's it. Let's go!
Come on, get in! Get in!
You cheated me out of one million bucks, Schmitz!
I should blow your head off right now.
Lucky for me you don't hold a grudge.
Don't I?
A million dollars is pocket change to what's going down.
I got a business proposition for you.
- You got connections, everyone knows.
- I don't take sides.
Exactly... You deal with everybody.
- I got something to deal.
- You can't sell Krebs on your own?
It's not about Krebs anymore.
It's about retinal contact lenses.
Smuggled in from Germany.
You put these in your eyes, you get through any retinal scanner.
Congressional or U.N.
I was gonna sell them but my buyer fell through.
Krebs was resistance.
Those belonged to his friends.
Do yourself a favor:
Just give them back and say you're sorry.
Goddamn it Barb, I can't.
They'll kill me and you know it.
The Congressionals broke into my office.
They slaughtered everybody.
They were looking for me.
With or without these,
I'm a dead man.
Relax, Schmitz, you can only die once.
Barb?
I know I double-crossed you.
I made a mistake. It happens.
I want to trade the lenses.
- I want to trade them to you.
- For what?
Get me out of Steel Harbor.
Canada maybe.
Just get me out and they're yours.
You want out?
Click your heels together three times.
You could sell these.
Do you know how much they're worth?
You could get two mil...
Canadian... easy.
Enough money for Europe. You could get an operation for Charlie's eyes.
I don't buy. I don't sell.
Get out!
You're gonna regret not dealing with me!
You're gonna regret this very, very much.
I'll add that to my list.
The subject is reasonably fresh.
We'll probably only get a few seconds of readable thought data.
Cognitive impressions, those closest to death first. And then what's left: memories, dreams.
- Record it.
- Sir. Step away from the tank.
- That's it?
- Here it is in slow motion, Colonel.
Issue a warrant for the arrest of Barb Wire.
Issue a warrant?
This isn't Washington, Pryzer.
- I need a reason.
- She's involved.
Well, you heard what he said.
Sometimes all you get are dreams.
Every man in Steel Harbor dreams about Barb Wire.
- I need something more conclusive...
- When did the law ever matter to you?
Miss Wire may know the whereabouts of the retinal lenses.
- We will search her bar.
- Retinal lenses?
All of this is over a set of Bausch and Lombs?
All of this is over capturing an enemy of the Republic, the traitor Cora D.
If Cora D. were to exit this charming free city, your relationship with the Republic would be severely compromised.
Painfully compromised.
Do I make myself clear?
Your administrative fee should cover the cost of issuing a search warrant.
Now, find a reason to search the Hammerhead!
As you wish, Colonel.
As you wish.
I'm unarmed.
How did you get in here?
Where's my dog?
I'm irresistible to females.
Thanks, Camille.
Towel!
- What? Are you gonna shoot me?
- Why waste a good bullet?
I thought I told you never to come back?
I came here to do a job.
The biggest operation
I ever signed up for.
I came ready for anything the Congressionals could lob at me.
The only thing I wasn't prepared for was running into you.
You'll get over it. I did.
I wouldn't have come here unless I had to.
I wouldn't be here if I knew you were coming.
Goddamn it!
I guess it's bad timing for both of us.
Am I interrupting something?
Lovely you brought company.
Barb, this is my wife, Cora D.
How impressive. I'm sure you'll have very strong, smart children.
Look, I know this is awkward for all of us.
You gotta know, all I wanted back in Seattle was to disappear with you.
- The war changed that.
- The war changed everything.
Good one.
I'm not surprised you don't believe me.
The mission took months.
I thought after all that time
I was better left a part of your past.
That's why I didn't get an invitation to your wedding?
Barb, there's more to the story than meets the eye.
Do you remember what happened in Topeka, Kansas?
How the whole city was wiped out?
I can explain.
I was Chief of Medical Research for the Congressional Directorate.
I was directly but unknowingly involved in a global project, an HIV derivative known as Red Ribbon.
It can kill you in twelve hours.
When I learned that Topeka, Kansas, was a lab experiment and the Congressionals planned to unleash it on the entire territory,
I defected to the resistance.
Axel got me out of Washington.
Initially we married on paper purely for identification purposes.
- We've been on the run ever since.
- How utterly, goddamn heroic!
Now, what the hell do you want with me?
Cora has the vaccine to Red Ribbon in her system.
The Congressionals want it back.
We have to get her to Canada to tell the Truth Commission there's a cure.
We have to tell the world.
We need your help.
The cause needs your help.
What has the cause done for me lately?
Barb, where are the contact lenses?
- If I knew you think I'd tell you?
- We know that Schmitz was here.
Now, if you know where the lenses are, for Christ's sake, name a price.
That's what you do, isn't it?
Sell yourself to the highest bidder?
I'm out of your price range.
- Is there another way out of here?
- Are you kidding?
The other way is covered.
Roll it, ladies.
Give me three minutes and meet me downstairs.
- Why should we trust you?
- Maybe you shouldn't.
- Check him!
- Yes, sir.
Put his head back.
Oh god!
He doesn't have any retinals, you morons!
Sorry about that, Charlie.
- We're not open for breakfast.
- It's legal. We have a warrant.
It's a little sticky.
- What exactly are you looking for?
- This... is a murder investigation.
It's a Congressional matter.
I can assure you, citizen, if we discover that you're involved, the consequences will be abrupt and severe.
- Who are they?
- I picked them up off the boulevard.
I like a good menage every now and then.
Go out through the back.
Scan them.
This is ridiculous.
Commence scan.
Sir, the scanner is broken, sir.
Idiot!
You're wasting my time. Get out!
How long is this gonna take?
As long as it takes, citizen.
As long as it takes.
I wish you could see this mess.
I couldn't see it when it was clean.
What the hell were they looking for anyway?
- Stupid contact lenses.
- Oh yeah?
Schmitz was here last night trying to trade them for a trip to Canada.
I should've done it.
- Contact lenses?
- Yeah.
Like these?
What color are they?
The color of money.
We can give them to Axel and help them escape.
This is our ticket to Europe.
- They don't belong to us!
- Finders keepers.
I still believe in fighting for what's right!
Cheer up, baby brother. We're rich.
You're making a mistake, Barb.
- Tell me that when we get to Paris.
- A big one!
- Charlie, you worry too much.
- It's not just about money.
I knew Charlie was still friendly with the resistance.
But I didn't know how friendly.
- He's expecting me.
- Let her through.
Big Fatso!
How's the king of the underworld?
Well, well, well...
- If it isn't Barb the buxom.
- A gesture.
Donuts! I thought
I'd be hearing from you real soon.
- I have a proposition.
- Oh now, ain't that sweet?
But you know
I only like big fat women.
A business proposition.
As in... lenses?
Don't give me that surprised look like you don't know what I'm talking about.
You didn't drive to the evil empire to see how my diet's going.
You came here to talk about the contact lenses, didn't you?
- I'm in a position to broker the sale.
- That's what I heard.
I believe you've already met... Mr. Schmitz.
Never looked better.
Let's make a deal.
Spike?
Anybody?
It's Charlie, I'm here.
- Spike ain't here.
- Well, where is she?
She knows
I was supposed to meet her here.
She sent me instead.
I talk to Spike or I talk to nobody!
If the resistance wants to know where those lenses are, you get me Spike!
Coming right down.
- Spike?
- Charlie Kopetski!
Hold him!
You're charged with concealing information regarding contact lenses!
You can cooperate and talk to me... or you can join your little friend.
I'd rather join my friend!
One million Canadian.
- Deal!
- I'm not done yet!
There's a plane I wanna catch at the old airport by the unoccupied zone.
Unoccupied zone...
Bad part of town.
I want save passage for me and Charlie all the way through there.
That means an escort to the old airport.
The zone can be very unpredictable, and the toll collector's quite difficult.
I'd have to stack a few more men here and there...
How about... half a mil Canadian?
750 upfront.
Deal! You got the lenses?
What do I look, new?
We'll meet at the first toll entering the zone an hour before sundown.
Cash for the lenses, right there.
You're five minutes late,
I'll sell to another buyer.
The damn screen is not picking up his thoughts!
Colonel, he has no visual data for that period.
Goddamn it! Where are the lenses?
Speak now, man or suffer at your leisure.
The Easter Bunny took them.
I'll talk.
I'll talk.
- This guy has them.
- What guy?
He's fat... wears a red suit... white beard.
The name is Kringle.
Kris Kringle.
Merry Christmas!
- What a mess!
- Well, this mess is all yours, Curly.
The bar is yours.
Get out!
I'm giving it to you.
Me and Charlie, we're history.
What do you mean, "history"?
You're leaving forever?
You're not coming back?
Look, Barb...
I have no experience in running a bar.
I'm just a waiter, for Christ's sake.
Curly, relax, you're a natural.
Camille!
Well, this is it.
I'm gonna miss you.
I'm gonna miss you too, Curly.
Now, take care of Camille, okay?
Yeah, all right.
I never thought I'd see the day you'd drive away in that horrible thing.
- Where's Charlie? He should be here.
- He went to see an old friend.
- Someone named Spike.
- Spike?
Get in!
Oh god!
Charlie!
Oh my god!
What happened?
They're just kids.
What's that?
Charlie.
We heard the Congressionals discovered this place.
- We were on our way to warn them.
- Yeah, well you were too late.
Listen to me, Barb, we need your help.
There's no more time. The plane leaves in 90 minutes. Only you can help us.
Please.
For Charlie.
I'll take care of Charlie.
Let's go.
- What about the lenses?
- They're safe.
She'll never be able to get on that plane without the contact lenses.
I said they're safe.
Are you coming or not?
Does the word "overkill" mean anything to you?
- Ever driven out of Steel Harbor?
- No.
Then shut up!
- What's this?
- It's a road block.
On the other side is the unoccupied zone.
There's a toll.
- You two stay here.
- What's going on?
This is our escort.
Look at her, all gussied up.
- Nice jewelry, Barb.
- Got the money?
No chit-chat?
Have it your way.
- I said cash!
- Hey, I had to work fast.
It's a gold debit card with 750'000 credit on it.
- It's as good as cash.
- That wasn't part of the deal, Fatso!
I told you, I had to work fast.
You got the lenses?
Nice.
- Watch them!
- What the hell you think you're doing?
- Back off, Axel!
- Well, well, well...
If it isn't Axel the freedom fighter and the famous Cora D.
We got ourselves the star-studded gathering going on here.
- How could you?
- How many times do I have to tell you?
I don't take sides!
I'm in this for me only.
Right, Big Fatso?
Right, and I like the way you think, Barb.
The lenses!
All right, phase two of the deal: a safe escort to the old airport.
Slight change of plans.
You fat son of a bitch!
Nice work, Mr. Big Fatso.
I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man!
Barb, I'm gonna have to ask you to drop your weapons.
You'll love this, Barb.
Not only do I get the lenses, but I get a million dollars bounty on your head and on the head of the doc for turning you both over to the Congressionals.
And not to mention the 750'000 dollar credit on the debit card.
Don't you just love it when a plan comes together?
The face may deceive, but the eyes never lie.
Do they, doctor Devonshire?
Washington has been in such an uproar since you ran away.
I can't tell you how eager we are to have you back.
Whore!
Chief Willis, arrest these people!
I want you to know I had nothing to do with what happened to Charlie.
And I'm sorry.
- Don't move!
- Look out, she's got a grenade!
Forward!
Hang on!
Jeez, we're gonna die!
I'll kill you! I'll break you in half!
How am I supposed to get on the plane?
If we ever get out of this alive,
I'll kill you!
- Axel, take the wheel!
- What?
Don't argue, hurry!
In an emergency pull that yellow lever.
How come I don't get to drive?
Second toll, dead ahead!
The airport's just beyond.
<iconv() failed>
- Does this constitute emergency?
- Yes!
Oh shit!
Hang on!
Where are you going?
Holy shit!
Wait up!
Give me your gun.
Willis, get them to the airport, quick! I'll stall them.
- You can't.
- I'll meet you at the plane.
Goodbye, Axel.
All right, let's go!
Get going to the airport,
I'm going back. Move!
There he is. Get him!
He's over here!
Follow him!
Hold your fire!
Where are you, bastard?
Gosh!
This one makes it go up and down?
Yeah, it does.
- Which one makes it go round?
- That one right here.
How about this one?
How touching, the last stand of the desperate.
Normally I don't get emotional about my work.
But vaporizing your springy ass is gonna be a real pleasure.
Oh Barb, we're so close.
Don't you feel the magic?
This is just like my favorite song...
- "I got you, babe!"
- Don't call me babe!
Attention! Attention!
Prepare for retinal scan identification enforcement.
Only U.N. authorized and identified personnel will be permitted past this point but fractions will be dealt with severely.
Damn, Willis, we gotta do something.
We'll create a flamboyant diversion.
Thanks.
There they are.
Are we cutting it close enough?
Put these in.
Final seating flight 647.
Destination Quebec, gate two.
Hold that plane!
Good luck, doc.
Thank you.
- Destination?
- Quebec.
Step to the scanner.
Retinal scan verified:
Citizen approved by all governments.
She's home free, mission completed.
You're gonna miss your plane.
I thought Barb Wire never took sides.
Keep it to yourself!
Last call, flight 647...
Goodbye, Axel.
Goodbye.
Willis.
Where will you go?
I hear
Paris is nice this time of the year.
I do believe I'm falling in love.
Get in line!
- Easy.
- Mornin'.
Mornin'. Y'all mind steppin' aside?
- You know what I think?
- No, sir, I don't.
I think you got yourselves a shipment of gold in that wagon... that you're bringin' to General Lee.
- Just who might you be?
- A friend of the Confederacy.
Why don't y'all show us what a good friend you are by steppin' aside?
I'd be most happy to,
'cept first...
I'd be much obliged if you'd give me that gold.
I don't think I heard you correct.
I think you did.
I'd like that gold now.
Listen, mister, it ain't very nice out here, as you can see.
There are five of us.
If you don't step aside now,
I'd just as soon kill you as not.
You wanna die out here in this miserable weather, that's your choice.
I'm gonna ask you one more time.
Would you please give me the gold?
Good afternoon, senators.
The president is very grateful for your time here.
Believe me, this is a matter of the utmost importance.
I cannot stress too much the utmost secrecy.
Why don't you just cut out the shit, George?
You're here to ask the committee for money, so come out and ask for it.
Thanks for the advice.
I am gonna ask you for money.
Guess what else?
You're gonna give it to me.
You all remember
Dr. Hans Kleindast... the Nobel Laureate who helped us during the space program?
For 20 years... he's been keeping his face off of Time magazine doing research.
His field of research has been time travel.
- Time travel.
- Time travel.
- Well, beam me up, Scotty.
- That's very funny, Senator.
- Wanna know what's funnier than that?
- He's gonna tell us.
The funny thing is... the good doctor actually did it.
I thought that'd get your attention.
He did it. The technology is in the folders in front of you.
You won't understand it any better than I can.
Now, you can't go forward, because the future hasn't happened yet.
However, you can go back, and that's where things get tricky.
If you go back and change something, it's serious. It could be catastrophic.
It's like throwing a stone in a lake... only now there are ripples in time.
So you can't go back and kill Hitler, much as we'd like to... because it could cause a chain reaction of events... that could alter or even destroy mankind.
And that, my good senators, is where you come in.
We have to form a new agency to police this technology and protect time.
It will be called the Time Enforcement
Commission or the T.E.C.
Eugene Matuzak of the Washington P.D.
Is our choice to run the commission.
- How much is this gonna cost?
- A lot.
- How much is a lot?
- More than a little and less than too much.
This is not a good time to ask for money. The economy...
Suppose one of our competitors goes back in time and invents the computer?
Or the airplane or the automobile?
You wanna talk about the American economy, Senator?
How about this one?
Saddam Hussein finances a trip to 1944.
He gets our technology... and Iraq becomes the first country to have the atomic bomb.
- Oh, you like that one.
- Not bad.
Try this one.
We think there's already been a ripple.
Ten days ago, the C.I.A. broke up an arms sale to terrorists... in Hamburg, Germany.
Ordinarily, that sort of news doesn't cross the president's desk.
What made this different... was that the purchase was made with gold bullion... and the bullion was dated 1863... and stamped
"Confederate States of America."
We had it carbon-tested and authenticated. It's real.
Now, just think about what I'm saying.
Going back in time is a pretty easy way to make money.
Our committee would have exclusive jurisdiction over this program?
Yours and yours alone. No one can know about this. It's too dangerous.
That's very good, George.
Personally...
I think this sounds like that bullshit Star Wars program.
You'll get your money. Anyone here want to chair the oversight on this program?
Yeah, I'll do it.
Ah, young Senator McComb.
Why not?
Oh, you'll like him, George.
Very much like you, except his dorsal fin's a bit bigger.
There's never enough time.
Never enough for what?
To satisfy a woman.
Then you never want to miss an opportunity.
Are you busy?
I'm meeting my husband.
If I were him,
I would not keep you waiting.
If he's not here when I turn around,
I'll go home with you.
You'll do.
I didn't hear you leave this morning.
It was early.
I was meeting with Matuzak.
Are you gonna take that job?
- What?
- Be right back.
Read it.
- "Wolverine"?
- Between the lines.
I should get the fuck outta here.
Good.
You know that purse?
Doesn't look good on you.
Thank you.
- Glad you're not hurt.
- Thank you.
Smart kid.
He read my mind.
With your English, he doesn't have much choice.
Hey, I know all the good words.
You didn't answer my question.
- Are you gonna take this job?
- I think so.
Is this T.E.C. thing dangerous?
I don't bake cookies for a living.
Will you have to travel?
Not the way you think.
Pictures bring back your memories.
Aw, you're gonna be very happy you have this.
Why?
I can see into the future.
You can see the future, huh?
- What do you see?
- I see it's gonna rain.
We both have the afternoon off.
Why don't we go and practice some of those words you seem to like so much?
Max?
Hmm? What?
I have something I want to tell you.
Shit. I'm sorry.
Don't answer it.
Just this once, don't answer it.
I have to.
Walker.
Now?
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Can you find somebody else?
Look, uh, somebody called in sick and...
And there's nobody but Max Walker...
- to keep the streets safe.
- I said I was sorry.
- It's not like I have a choice.
- Of course you have a choice.
- This is what I do.
- I know that's what you do.
It's just that things are different now.
What are you talking about?
This isn't the way
I wanted to do this.
I have to go.
There's something you need to tell me?
Yes.
Can you wait until I get back?
Sure.
Surprise.
Max!
Melissa!
Max!
- Finish him.
- Who are you?
You're a smart boy.
Why don't you sleep on it a while?
Nothing to see over there.
It's just another jumper.
Hang on, there, buddy!
All right, close enough! That's it!
Thank you!
Stand back, folks!
Come on! Break it up!
There's nothin' to see!
Go back to work. Come on!
Come on, now! Come on, now.
Break it up.
Go back to work.
Come on. Come on, get out of here.
- Good morning, Mr. Atwood.
- Good morning, Charlie.
- It's a terrible day, sir.
- Beat it.
- What's goin' on?
- Mr. Floatbauer.
He went off the roof.
Ah, yeah.
Well, shit happens.
Excuse me.
Oh, that poor man!
Good morning, Pete.
Good morning, Mr. Atwood.
Third jumper this week. They keep this up, you're gonna be out of a job.
Only going down, sir.
There he is!
- Mr. Atwood, isn't it terrible?
- Tragic.
...little lovebirds
We're not above birds
Let's misbehave
Slip and slide
Slip inside
Slip and slide
I learn to love
I learn to live
Get me Ross.
Ross! Hi!
Yeah, listen.
I want another 100,000 shares of Middle States Oil.
No, no. Just buy it.
It's an act of faith.
I really think things are gonna turn around.
I got a feeling about the future.
Look, I gotta go.
I'm... I'm very busy.
- Walker.
- How've you been, Lyle?
How ya doin', partner?
- Ex-partner.
- Max.
I'm not gonna change a thing. The only ripples'll be in my swimming pool.
It's a nice place.
You couldn't do this by yourself.
- Who are you working for?
- I'm not hurtin' anybody.
It's America, man! I'm just takin' an opportunity, that's all.
I've got to take you back.
I went ten rounds with
John L. Sullivan himself.
I saw Tyson beat Spinks on TV.
- Mr. Atwood... Oh, my god!
- Get down.
Doesn't look too good, Lyle.
Let me go, Max.
I'll stay here.
I won't go back.
Who sent you?
I want the name.
Like it'll make any difference.
In a few weeks, this guy's gonna run the whole country.
If he doesn't get the money here, he's gonna get it somewhere else.
I can't tell you. He'll send somebody back to wipe out my grandparents.
It'll be like I never existed:
My mother, my father, my wife, my kids, my fuckin' cat!
You ever hear of the name Aaron McComb?
Senator McComb?
Bullshit.
You don't understand.
He's gonna be president.
He's doin' this to get money for his campaign.
Shit, Max, he already owns most of the guys we work with!
When we get back, you'll point them out.
You're out of your mind.
This guy's gonna roll right over you.
- We'll see. Let's go.
- Listen to me!
If I go back and talk, my family is dead.
I'm talkin' about my f... my family!
If I die here, it's only me.
I can't go back!
I have to bring you back.
I have no choice.
Neither do I.
Holy Mother of Mary!
Lieutenant Clapton, 0316.
Lieutenant Clapton.
Testify and I'll do what I can.
Communication relays rerouted to Alpha 02.
Captain Lyle Atwood, you are charged with violations... of T.E.C. code 40.8, subsection nine... time travel with intent to alter the future.
Charges are compounded by your current status as a time enforcement officer.
Does the defendant have any statement?
- Tell her.
- Something to say on your own behalf?
- Yes.
- No.
Then I will pass sentence as mandated by our charter.
Say something.
Come on. Say something!
The defendant has been found guilty...
Take care of yourself, Max.
And is sentenced to death, immediately.
Poor bastard.
Tomorrow might've been a brighter day.
We're pickin' up some noise outside Camp David, '79.
Intelligence thinks it's a kill team out of Iran.
It's their third try this year.
C.I.A.'s trying to locate their launch facility.
I want two teams on this date.
Let's smoke these guys.
- Right.
- Number two: Los Angeles, 1902.
Somebody's trying to get a jump on real-estate, buying up Beverly Hills.
- Burr and Swain got the deal.
- Yes, sir.
You look like shit.
- We have to talk.
- In a minute.
- Now.
- I said in a minute.
Temporary wave guide shutdown in three minutes.
Shit. Go over your dispatch notes and check with me before you launch.
- Good afternoon, gentlemen.
- George. Welcome.
Gene. Senator Nelson, this is
T.E.C. Director Matuzak.
Senator Nelson is the newest member of the oversight committee.
Since he's gonna be voting on your budget... he'd like to see how it's spent.
Senator McComb, our long-standing committee chairman... agreed to take time out from his presidential campaign to accompany us.
Senator.
Well. Be a pleasure to show you around.
Are these all of your agents?
Most of 'em. Agent Monroe.
Agent Anderson.
Agents Burr, Bartolo and Shepherd.
- Agent Walker.
- Agent Walker.
I've heard a great deal about you.
- And I've heard a lot about you.
- Not all of it bad, I hope.
Agent Walker just returned from a successful mission.
Well, congratulations,
Agent Walker.
Senator, now Director Matuzak will show you the launch room.
Follow me.
I'll show you where we kick off.
You wouldn't mind if Agent Walker accompanied us?
I'd love to hear about his most recent mission.
- I have a report to file.
- Agent Walker would be delighted.
All units switch to TEC channel three.
All units switch to TEC channel three.
As you can see, we've spared every expense.
No comfort, no convenience, no necessities. Watch your head.
So, Agent Walker, who were you after?
A man named Atwood.
Ring a bell?
Atwood. No.
Should that name be familiar to me?
- Unfortunately, Atwood was a TEC agent.
- Really?
See, George, I don't want to sound like a broken record... but that's one of the dangers of having an agency like this.
- Imagine the dangers of not having it.
- Did you know this Atwood?
He was my partner.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Nothing worse than a rogue cop.
- Except the guy who paid him.
- If there is such a guy.
- There always is.
- Do you know who the man is?
- Oh, yeah.
- Why don't you arrest him?
I lost my witness.
Well, I trust you'll keep working on it.
You can bet on it.
Hydrogen specialists, prepare for inspection.
We've updated our entire operation to Parker Datalink Systems... utilizing their superconducting chip.
Senator McComb was Jack Parker's partner... and sold out before the company got the patent on that chip.
- Bet that cost you a few billion.
- Whoa, bad luck.
My deal with Jack Parker is not important, Mr. Spota.
What is important is talking about the dangers of this program.
- You got my vote.
- Excuse me. What dangers?
Well, dishonest agents like this, uh, Atwood.
Every time an agent goes back, he risks making contact with the past version of himself.
- That could be a disaster.
- And why is that?
The same matter can't occupy the same space at the same time.
It's never happened.
Not yet, but what I propose... is far less costly yet accomplishes the same thing.
Why don't we just prevent time travel... rather than spend money trying to police it?
I have to get back to the Hill.
Malcolm, this is a project that we could do without.
I hope you vote against continued appropriations.
I admire your dedication,
Agent Walker.
I hope you keep trying to get your man.
I never quit.
We've done a breakdown of the latest poll results.
While the trends are not what we want... there are some good things we can utilize.
The numbers in the suburbs are encouraging... but they are killing you in the urban centers.
But you're gaining with the pro-life, pro-death-penalty coalition... and with the close-our-border, anti-immigration faction.
The bad news is the campaign chairman put together a projected budget... from now to Election Day, and it's a big number.
Even going back again, I don't see how you could get it all in time.
Lawrence, I love you.
I really do.
But don't tell me what I can't do.
Elections are won with television.
You don't need the press, endorsements.
You don't even need the truth.
You need money.
So... tell me.
How much is it gonna cost to buy the network time I need?
- $50 million.
- $50 million.
Agent Walker has already cost me that much.
We're gonna chat with him, the kind of chat a man remembers for a lifetime.
Sure is a handsome devil, isn't he?
- He's not my type.
- What did you want to talk about?
What do you know about him?
Capable of eating his young.
He sure seemed interested in you this afternoon.
He interests me.
Atwood named him.
- You're shittin' me.
- He's the one who sent him back.
- Why didn't he testify?
- McComb would go after his family.
He also said McComb has half of the agency. I believe him.
He doesn't have me.
I said, he doesn't have me.
- Well, fuck you too.
- He's gonna close the agency.
Then no one can stop him from going back.
- This one is mine.
- Not unless I say it is.
The son of a bitch is a presidential candidate.
If you haul him in, you better have enough evidence to plug up the Potomac.
- You believe me.
- I always believe you... but you're not always right.
Yeah.
Come over to the house for dinner.
Carol would love to see you.
Thanks. Some other time.
You're allowed to have a life.
I read it in a manual.
I'll tell you this:
If I cannot go back to save her... this scumbag is not going back to steal money.
Go home, Max.
If you won't come to mine, go to yours.
By the way, when I said
McComb hasn't bought me... you were supposed to say,
"I know that."
I know that.
System initialized.
Destination, please.
Home.
There are no new messages.
Television.
Play tape.
It's going to look like this when I'm finished.
See? Very nice.
"Victorian Villa Deluxe Birdhouse."
This thing is gonna be bigger than our house by the time I'm done.
Okay.
- Want some help?
- Want some help?
Yeah. You can buy the birdseed.
Okay. Divide all these parts... into groups to determine their structural function.
- I should buy more videotapes.
- I should buy more videotapes.
Gotta be in the mood to do this.
- You were a second ago.
- You were a second ago.
I think that I should... start with something easier to put together.
Huh? Honey?
Maybe you should lay out all the parts first, then...
- You know...
- I think I wanna try from memory.
Just find part "A" and work from there.
The controversy... over government-provided campaign funds is in the news again.
The White Supremacist Party has qualified for matching funds... sparking many groups to petition for the abolition of the practice.
Meanwhile, Senator McComb's fading presidential bid... received another blow... when today it was denied federal campaign matching funds.
Sources indicate the senator is out of money... and may be forced to withdraw from the race.
Though no official statement has been made... independent party leaders claim that the denial will bolster their play... for the upcoming presidential election.
With the polls showing independent candidate Elgin Michaels... trailing the incumbent by only six points...
There are no new messages.
Who are you?
Who sent you?
Who sent you?
Fifty thousand volts, motherfucker.
Have a nice day.
Walker?
Walker!
My name's Fielding.
I'm with Internal Affairs.
He messed up my apartment.
You can kill him.
You've got some more inside.
- Everybody freeze!
- I'm a cop! I'm a cop!
I.D.
I.D.
Get in there.
You, he's under arrest.
They're all under arrest.
Assault, attempted murder, makin' a mess.
Sector 17, Sector 19.
Report for duty in five minutes.
If you'd like,
I'll have the door removed.
I had company this morning.
- You look like they stayed awhile.
- McComb sent them.
- Did they say that?
- I said that.
- And what does I.A. Want?
- Atwood was your partner.
Internal Affairs isn't convinced you can be trusted anymore.
- She's not going to follow me.
- We've got a phase four. You take it.
Send somebody else.
I want to be where McComb is.
A little refresher course in Agency etiquette: I'm the director, I direct.
I authorize the missions. I make the assignments. This one's yours.
This agency isn't dead yet, but if I can't keep you from McComb, it will be!
- Fielding, get in here!
- She'll get in my way.
Ask her to stay behind you.
You've got an hour until launch.
- You're not funny.
- I'm never funny.
Yeah?
Disturbance has jumped from four to six, sir.
Yes.
Yes.
I catch you fuckin' this machine again,
I'll break your neck.
- Sorry, Chief.
- Looks like safe sex to me.
- Show me.
- Okay.
Here we go. The ripple was steady at four, then spiked past five to six.
On the board, it looks like it set off Waimea.
Somebody's really doing a number.
We've located the point of origin and...
- it's right here in Washington.
- Shit.
Come on.
You're out of here.
You should have an exhibit.
Oh, really? All my best stuff's at home.
I really could care less whether you like me or not... but you don't know a thing about me.
T minus three minutes and counting.
I've been with I.A. For two years.
I'm field-rated in weapons and tactics and speak three languages. Impressed?
- I'm blown away.
- I read the Atwood file.
You didn't mention you could read.
He was your friend, and you still asked to go after him.
- He crossed the line.
- Or he crossed you.
Launch sequence activated.
Authorized personnel only in the area.
She looks just like the Vollmers!
T minus two minutes and counting.
Why is everyone so nervous?
When a launch goes wrong, they're the guys who scrape the wall.
And you do look like the Vollmer twins.
Who are the Vollmer twins?
Launch personnel only in the bay.
T minus one minute 30 seconds and counting.
Magnetic field polarity initiation in ten seconds.
Telemetry check is initiated.
Are we gonna blast to the past!
Yee-hah!
Green for launch!
I've run dozens of simulated launches... but I-I never noticed that wall before.
- "Simulated"?
- This is my first real launch.
Great. Don't stick your head out of the window.
- She's a little shaky.
- Blood pressure'll loosen her teeth.
Her pulse is pushing 140.
If she farts, she'll get ahead of the pod.
Fielding, listen to me.
It helps to concentrate... on something relaxing during a launch.
What do you think about?
Not swallowing my tongue.
- How's Walker?
- You'd have to shake him... to be sure he's awake.
- He's awake.
- T minus 30 seconds.
- Have they ever lost a pod?
- Ask the Vollmers.
- Where are they?
- See those two red spots?
- Oh, God.
- Nine... eight... seven...
Six... five... four...
Three... two... one...
Zero.
They're away.
Is this the hottest thing or what?
Goddamn Ricky.
So much for a dry run.
We're alive.
- Are we where we're supposed to be?
- Give me a date.
Sunday, October 9, 1994.
Target.
- We're close.
- October 9?
- I'll be 16 tomorrow.
- Where?
I was living in Colorado.
Man, this is weird. Whew.
Yeah? Well, don't get sentimental and try to visit yourself.
I'd like to call myself, tell me not to sleep with Bobby Morgan after my party.
It's really disappointing.
A smart woman would call Bobby... and give him some advice.
Aw, yeah, right.
- How long was Atwood your partner?
- Three years.
- Was it difficult to bring him back?
- What do you think?
You got a family?
Mine's still in Colorado.
When my dad started reading about time travel... he said it was a bigger threat to the world than the nuclear bomb.
He's right.
That's why I joined the agency.
The world should be able to party on Saturday night... and not worry whether the planet's going to be here on Monday.
- You sound like a woman I knew.
- Someone remarkable, I hope.
Yeah.
Someone you knew, huh?
So, where is she?
She was killed.
Sorry.
You must've thought about going back and changing that.
We're here.
I thought it was just Parker Datalink.
Take the back and wait for my call.
Keep your head down.
Tomorrow's your birthday.
- I have a problem.
- You do?
Yes. Let me tell you what my problem is.
This isn't working.
I can't keep paying for this.
- Hey, it doesn't matter to me.
- Oh, but it should, Jack.
You're taking the goddamn company into bankruptcy.
We have a difference of opinion.
The chip is the future of this company.
- Since you don't agree, walk away.
- This isn't the first time we've had this conversation.
Come up with money and I'm out of here.
You know I can't afford it... but I've found an enterprising banker with faith in the future.
Take it.
You're out.
You've got no faith in the company... and I've got none in politicians.
If I were you,
I wouldn't cash that check.
It's gonna cost you more than you'll ever know.
Hey, Jack, it's been a while.
- What is this?
- It's me.
Well, it's, it's him.
No, it's us.
W-W-Where did you come from?
- Are you his father?
- Do I look that old?
I'm a United States senator.
Hurting me is a federal offense.
- I don't know about Jack's business.
- Will you stop it?
J-Just stop it.
Get a grip.
I remember having bigger balls.
I'm gonna have to get this fixed. Right...
Don't touch me.
Same matter can't occupy the same space.
Same matter?
So, you got a special N.S.A. Briefing coming up.
Secret session.
That's not for another week.
Time travel, someone says, gets a big laugh.
Oh, Christ, you're me.
How far back have you come?
Never interrupt me when I'm talking to myself.
- We're gonna take them.
- What's the signal?
You were a visionary.
The computer market was saturated.
The software stocks were in the toilet... and your fuckin' coldware revolutionizes the industry.
I made a mistake.
- I came to tell you I changed my mind.
- Now.
Freeze!
Do you realize how inappropriate that word is? Do I look frozen to you?
You look like shit to me.
Get away from him!
Move!
Drop the guns, now.
Under your jacket there's a track-and-return module.
Throw it to me.
You, uh, gonna leave me back here?
Do it.
Agent Walker, I wanna see how you get down here and keep the gun on us.
What are you gonna do?
You gonna jump?
That's how the Vollmers would do it.
Move back.
Give me the envelope.
Thank you.
The country's going down the drain because of the special interests.
We need someone rich in the White House who doesn't have to listen to anybody.
- What's that?
- The senator was having a fund-raiser.
When I'm in office, it's gonna be like the '80s.
Top 10% will get richer, the rest can emigrate to Mexico, live a better life.
So, you goin' or stayin'?
I think you plan too far ahead.
Obviously, you don't.
Anything else you want to tell me about yourself?
Don't tell anyone I killed ya.
I'm out on bail.
Okay, let's finish up and get out of here.
He's running for president.
I'm voting early.
Good seeing you again, Jack.
Maybe he'll calm down after the election.
What's the big deal?
Point it, pull the trigger... and, boom, somebody dies.
Get up there!
Get the module!
Fuckin' great!
Will you get him?
Goddamn it.
Aaron!
Come here.
You own the company, do you understand?
The chip is going to be worth billions, my billions.
Now, read this.
You just read it and do what it says.
Now, you get out of here.
Oh. And will you do me a favor?
Will you lay off the fuckin' candy bars?
Have a nice day.
- I should've said, "Freeze."
- I think he got the idea.
Do me a favor.
Don't give up without a fight.
Never crossed my mind.
I don't want to fight a woman.
Then don't.
Changed my mind.
Tell me he's gonna kill your family.
- Don't you leave me, damn it!
- Who are you talking to?
Stay here, Walker.
In my future, you're dead.
Look at this!
Let's get a canine unit up there.
- What the hell's going on here?
- You're lucky you got back.
They're gettin' ready to tear up these tracks.
- McComb?
- Who else?
- He hasn't got the power.
- Are you kiddin'?
He's ahead in the polls. He's probably out buying running shoes for his team.
Senate committee caved in. They want to be on the good side of the new boss.
What's the matter?
It's been headed this way for months.
When I left, nothing had happened.
Hey, Walker, when they tear up the launcher, you get the pod as a memento.
He's changed the future.
What are you talking about?
McComb.
He's buying the presidency.
What's new?
It's been done before.
- The guy is a killer.
- Doesn't surprise me.
- He killed my agency.
- He shot two people.
- Who?
- Who? A guy named Parker and Fielding.
- Do I know them?
- Fielding was with me.
- You sent her.
- I don't like this guy one bit... but just who can I sell this story to without 50 eyewitnesses?
- How about one?
- You don't count.
There's a chance she's still alive.
- Who?
- Fielding. The cops were there.
I'm gonna be looking for a new government job.
I don't think it will help my chances... if I'm the guy that tried to put our next president in jail.
- You think I'm making this up?
- Forget it! You're not going back!
If she's alive, we've got him.
You understand that?
We've got the guy.
We're shut down.
Take a look around. We're history.
Wait, I'm gonna show you something.
You come with me.
Those files are supposed to be sealed.
I don't know why I'm doing this.
You say you were my best friend?
- For a long time.
- I liked you?
- Oh, yeah.
- What are you looking for?
Fielding's friends or family; anyone she would go to in 1994.
- Who was she?
- I.A., but she had a deal with McComb.
He's got to go back to be sure she's dead.
Since you say we were close friends...
I'm gonna ask you a question the prison psychiatrist will ask you.
How's our leading presidential candidate... making these expeditions into the past without our equipment, old pal?
The prototype was never dismantled.
Kleindast's.
It's in Calverton, Maryland.
Short drive from Washington.
We have no authority to get in there.
What about Ricky?
If you were my best friend, you wouldn't do this to me.
I would have had him killed right here, but if he's back... he's already told the story to Matuzak.
God knows who else.
They won't get it, but they'll sure give it thought if he comes up dead.
- Right.
- He'll have to be erased.
Erased.
Have him killed before he joined T.E.C.
That way nobody in the Agency ever talked to him or even knew him.
- Perfect.
- It's not perfect. It's all we've got.
Don't expect to be my chief of staff... if slamming you into the side of the car... turns you into a sniveling worm.
Well, what do you know?
At random intervals, Maryland Utilities shows spikes in demand and duration...
- that are almost identical to ours.
- Send me back.
- No, they won't let us do that.
- Stay out of it, Ricky.
Would it be too much trouble to call me Richard?
Richard, do I have a best friend around here?
It isn't me.
Maybe Gordon.
Gordon is a putz. I can tell you who my best friend was... in school, in the marines, when I was a cop.
Gordon doesn't fit.
I'm not saying you do... but since I'd like to see McComb take a fall, you get the benefit of the doubt.
- Whoa! Where you goin'?
- We've got to vent the fuel shunts.
Oh, is that right? You'll have to wait while I get authori...
Was I your only friend?
A launch is not a one-man operation.
Yeah, I know.
If I'm off on velocity or trajectory, you're gonna be an omelette.
- You trying to scare me?
- Yeah.
- Just hit the right year.
- I'll see ya.
I've had your wife's goulash a hundred times; always too much salt.
Here goes the pension.

Get me the police mainframe computer.
I want all Jane Does admitted to local hospitals on October 9.
Check if any of the Jane Does are victims of multiple gunshot wounds.
Gotcha.
Dr. Lemon, call line one-five.
Dr. Lemon, call line one-five.
Police. Jane Doe.
Happy birthday.
Thanks.
Get me anything?
- Tell me what you want.
- I want to go home.
I already know who's gonna win the next ten World Series.
- No problem.
- Why'd you come back?
I need you to testify against McComb.
Mmm.
That would be my pleasure.
- It could be dangerous.
- I know that.
It's not that simple.
McComb has made some changes.
- You were never in the T.E.C.
- No, that can't be.
I had the training for six years.
- I have friends.
- I've got to move fast.
If I can find you, so can he.
What can I do?
I need proof that you existed here.
In case I don't make the trip, huh?
They just took some blood.
It would be in the lab.
- I'll be right back.
- Hey.
- I really screwed up.
- Yes, you did.
I want to make things right.
You may find you can make things right for yourself.
I'll be right back.

I'm gonna take you to someplace safe.
What are you doing?
Help! Security!
Help! Security!
Somebody call security!
Help!
Security!
Call security!
Hey! Hold it!
Don't move!
Pictures bring back your memories.
- This is for what you're going to do.
- Hey, wha...
- What the...
- Melissa... don't turn around.
- Why? What's wrong?
It's okay.
- Listen. Listen.
- Who are you?
It's me. Look.
It's Max.
Max? Max, what happened?
I can't tell you right now.
We have to go.
Trust me.
Trust me.
Come on.
Let's go.
Here! Here!
Please! Just tell me what happened to you!
Just try to believe me.
I love you.
Trust me.
- You're not Max.
- It's me.
Ten years from now, it's me.
- That's not possible.
- Remember:
- Matuzak, the new job, time travel.
- Time travel?
If one day I need a birdhouse built,
I know who to talk to.
- Oh, my god.
- It's me. It's Max.
- I can't believe this.
- Try.
What am I like ten years from now?
Just like now.
Perfect.
You time traveled, and what? Why?
Let me show you.
Today you have something very special to tell him.
- How do you know that?
- I've just told you.
What are you here to prevent?
Changes in the past.
Why? What's gonna happen?
Later. Stay and meet with him.
Don't tell him anything, please.
There's never enough time.
Never enough for what?
To satisfy a woman.
Then you never want to miss an opportunity.
- Are you busy?
- I'm meeting my husband.
Senator McComb!
Sir!
That message came from the senate operator, sir.
- It's 3:30. You have a 4:00 with...
- Clear my schedule.
- All of it.
- Yes, sir.
Kelly, have you ever been inside the president's limo?
No, sir.
You keep in touch.
I'll send you a photograph of it.
I have something I want to tell you.
- Oh, shit.
- Don't answer it.
I have to.
- Did not tell him?
- He didn't give me a chance.
You should have tried.
Are we still together in ten years?
Yes, we're together.
- Do you have a picture?
- No, nothing recent.
- Am I dead?
- No. You're not dead.
What about tomorrow?
Everything is going to be fine, okay?
Why can't we just get out? Why can't we just run away from whatever it is?
It would come back as many times as it takes.
It has to end tonight.
Hurry!
Keep him upstairs.
Whatever you do, keep him upstairs.
Just do what I say.
Please! Go!
Max, I don't want you to go.
I'll be back soon.
I... I'm pregnant.
- Great.
- I love you.
- Surprise.
- Who the fuck are you?
Friend of the family.
Don't go down!
Upstairs.
- How did you miss him?
- He knew it was comin'.
It was a T.E.C. cop.
Son of a bitch doesn't know how to die.
He'll learn tonight.
You don't kill him, you don't go back.
Upstairs.
Max.
Oh, my god, Max.
Look out!
You have nothing soft to land on, do you?
Go! Go!
- I'll get help!
- Go!
Say, "Ah."
Oh, shit.
Boy, that's gotta hurt.
Lousy night to be out.
Don't hurt her.
You were at a disadvantage in this from the beginning.
I'm an ambitious
Harvard-educated visionary... who deserves to be the most powerful man in the world... and you, you're a fuckin' idiot who never figured out... that the only way to make anything of all that fancy kicking is on Broadway.
Thanks for clearing that up.
The polls have me winning by 28 points.
That's the biggest landslide since Nixon back in '72.
I find it reassuring to know what the future holds, don't you?
That's C-4.
It'll turn this house into dust and also separate every part of you...
- from every other part of you.
- Let her go. You've got me.
I don't want you.
Agent Walker is too visible.
But Officer Walker, dead, is just another D.C. statistic.
When he's gone, you're gone.
Get the younger one.
I want him to see this.
- He's dead.
- No, he's not, you moron.
If he were dead, he would not be here. Get him.
Let her go!
- What do you want?
- You're a bright boy.
Why don't you sleep on it?
I did that.
It's different than before, isn't it?
It's what happens when you change time.
Lines of confluence, probability scales, all that shit.
Put your gun on the floor.
What were you gonna do? Shoot me?
A bomb is gonna go off any second now.
You know what happens then?
We're all gonna be dead.
I'm gonna win by default.
My young self is still gonna be president... and you can't save your wife.
Just like you couldn't save her once before.
She died because you came back and made some changes.
Now you're gonna fuck with time.
- You're as bad as me.
- Wrong. I'm setting it right.
Usually I hate doing things more than once... but in this case,
I don't see any other option.
I do.
What the fuck are you doing here?
You called me. You left a message with the senate operator.
I didn't leave any message, you fucking idiot!
Don't argue among yourself.
I left it.
Now nobody's got a future.
Okay.
This is a real mess now.
I hope you're happy.
This is a real mess.
You turned a simple, ordinary murder into a bloodbath.
You get out of here. Get out of here.
Go! Now! Go!
- You two should be closer.
- Keep him away from me.
The same matter can't occupy the same space.
I'm still kicking.
I must be on Broadway.
No!
Coordinates downloaded to G.P.S. Sequencer.
Re-entry sequence is completed.
Launch bay alert is now terminated.
Hey, where you goin'?
- What happened to you?
- What are you talkin' about?
You're walking around.
I've been doing that since I was about two. Does that seem abnormal?
I...
- What's going on with Senator McComb?
- Senator McComb?
If you want time off, ask. Don't act like you're out of your head.
- I've got a blank spot.
- You've got a hole in your head.
Ten years ago, McComb left his office, canceled all his appointments... disappeared, nobody's ever seen him since.
That's so sad.
I-I-I remember.
What are you hangin' around for?
Database 309, shut down.

This time, stay away from trouble.
Do I know you?
I guess not.
Hey! Bobby Morgan is still waiting for a second chance.
- Destination, please.
- Home.
Dad!
Dad, Mom said you'd barbecue hot dogs.
Yeah.
- What kind of day did you have?
- Busy.
You all right?
Great.
Good.
Come here.
I have something to tell you.
Take your time.
I'm not going anywhere.
I can't wait forever
Even though you want me to
I can't wait forever
To know if you'll be true
Time won't let me
Whoa, no
Time won't let me
Whoa, no
Time won't let me
Wait that long
Can't you see
I've waited too long
To love you and hold you in my arms
I can't wait forever
Even though you want me to
Time won't let me
Whoa, no
Time won't let me
Whoa, no
Time won't let me
I can't wait forever
Even though you want me to
I can't wait forever
To know if you'll be true
Time won't let me
Whoa, no
Time won't let me
Whoa, no
Time won't let me
Wait that long
Time won't let me
Whoa, no
Time won't let me
Whoa, no
Time won't let me
Time won't let me
Wait that long
Wait that long
I'm comin' home, I'm comin' home
I hear you talkin' to you, baby
Gotta get you back inside of my arms
Oh pretty baby, won't you listen to me
Can't you tell how much I need you
Can't you tell my love is so strong
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey
Locutus.
I am Locutus of Borg.
Resistance is futile.
Authorization, Picard 4-7-alpha-tango.
- Admiral.
- Catch you at a bad time, Jean-Luc?
No, of course not.
I've just received a disturbing report from Deep Space Five.
Our colony on Ivor Prime was destroyed this morning.
- Long-range sensors have picked up...
- Yes, I know. The Borg.
Captain's Log, Stardate 50893.5.
The moment I have dreaded for nearly six years has finally arrived.
The Borg, our most lethal enemy, have begun an invasion of the Federation, and this time, there may be no stopping them.
- How many ships?
- One.
And it's on a direct course for Earth.
They will cross the Federation border in less than an hour.
Admiral Hayes is mobilizing a fleet in the Typhon sector.
At maximum warp, it will take us three hours, 25 minutes...
- We're not going.
- What do you mean, we're not going?
Our orders are to patrol the Neutral Zone in case the Romulans decide to take advantage of the situation.
The Romulans?
Captain, there has been no unusual activity along the Romulan border for the last nine months.
It seems highly unlikely they would choose this moment to start a conflict.
Does Starfleet feel we need more shakedown time?
Captain, we've been out in space nearly a year now. We're ready.
The Enterprise-E is the most advanced starship in the fleet.
We should be on the frontline.
I have gone over all this with
Starfleet Command. Their orders stand.
Number One, set a course for the Neutral Zone.
- Bizet?
- Berlioz. What do you have?
We finished our first sensor sweep of the Neutral Zone.
Fascinating.
Twenty particles of space dust per cubic meter, fifty-two ultraviolet radiation spikes and a class-2 comet.
This is certainly worthy of our attention.
Captain, why are we out here chasing comets?
Let's just say that Starfleet has every confidence in the Enterprise and her crew.
They're just not sure about her captain.
They believe that a man who was once captured and assimilated by the Borg should not be put in a situation where he would face them again.
To do so would introduce an unstable element to a critical situation.
That's ridiculous.
Your experience with the Borg makes you the perfect man to lead this fight.
Admiral Hayes disagrees.
- Bridge to Captain Picard.
- Go ahead.
We've just received word from the fleet.
They've engaged the Borg.
Mr. Data, put Starfleet frequency 1-4-8-6 on audio.
Aye, sir.
Flagship to Endeavor, stand by to engage at grid A-15.
Defiant and Bozeman, fall back to mobile position one.
Acknowledged.
We have it in visual range. A Borg cube on course 0 mark 2-1-5, speed warp...
We are the Borg. Lower your shields and surrender your ships.
We will add your biological and technological distinctiveness to our own.
Your culture will adapt to service us.
Resistance is futile.
All units, open fire. Remodulate shield...
They've broken through the defense perimeter...
...toward Earth. Pursuit course...
The cube is changing course.
0-2-1 mark 4.
Defiant, continue to attack.
Flagship to Starfleet Command.
We need reinforcements.
Casualty report is coming in...
...96 dead, 22 wounded on the Lexington.
Lieutenant Hawk, set a course for Earth.
- Aye, sir.
- Maximum warp.
I'm about to commit a direct violation of our orders.
Any of you who wish to object should do so now.
It will be noted in my log.
Captain, I believe I speak for everyone here, sir, when I say to hell with our orders.
Red alert! All hands to battle stations!
Engage.
- Report!
- Main power is off-line.
We've lost shields and our weapons are gone.
Perhaps today is a good day to die.
Prepare for ramming speed!
Sir, there's another starship coming in.
It's the Enterprise.
The Defiant's losing life support.
Bridge to Transporter Room 3.
Beam the Defiant survivors aboard.
Captain, the Admiral's ship has been destroyed.
What is the status of the Borg cube?
It has sustained heavy damage to its outer hull.
I am reading fluctuations in their power grid.
Onscreen.
Number One, open a channel to the fleet.
Channel open, sir.
This is Captain Picard of the Enterprise.
I'm taking command of the fleet.
Target all of your weapons onto the following coordinates.
- Fire on my command.
- Sir.
The coordinates you have indicated do not appear to be a vital system.
Trust me, Data.
The fleet's responded, sir.
They're standing by.
Fire.
- Mr. Hawk, pursuit course. Engage.
- Aye, sir.
What?
I can hear them.
I have a patient here who insists on coming to the Bridge.
Welcome aboard the Enterprise-E, Mr. Worf.
Thank you, sir.
- The Defiant?
- Adrift but salvageable.
- Tough little ship.
- Little?
Mr. Worf, we could use some help at tactical.
You do remember how to fire phasers?
Sensors show chronometric particles emanating from the sphere.
- They're creating a temporal vortex.
- Time travel.
Data, report.
We appear to be caught in a temporal wake.
Captain. Earth.
The atmosphere contains high concentrations of methane, carbon monoxide and fluorine.
- Life-signs?
- Population, approximately 9 billion.
All Borg.
- How?
- They must've done it in the past.
They went back and assimilated Earth, changed history.
But if they changed history, why are we still here?
The temporal wake must have somehow protected us from the changes in the timeline.
- Sir, the vortex is collapsing.
- Hold your course, Mr. Hawk.
We must follow them back, repair whatever damage they've done.
- Come on.
- Good night, Eddie.
Go home.
You're gonna regret this tomorrow.
One of the things you should have learned about me by now is that I don't have regrets.
- Come on, Lily. One more round.
- Z. Z, you had enough.
I'm not going up in that thing with a drunken pilot.
I sure as hell am not going up there sober.
What is that?
That is the constellation Leo.
No. That.
- It's an ECON!
- After all these years?
We gotta get to the Phoenix.
To hell with the Phoenix.
- Help! Help!
- Hurry! Move out! Move!
This way! Zefram!
Report.
Shields are down, long-range sensors are off-line, main power's holding.
According to our astrometric readings, we are in the mid-21st century.
From the radioactive isotopes in the atmosphere, I would estimate we have arrived approximately
10 years after the Third World War.
Makes sense. Most of the major cities have been destroyed, very few governments left,
600 million dead.
- No resistance.
- Captain.
Mr. Worf, quantum torpedoes.
- Ready, sir.
- Fire.
They were firing at the surface.
Location?
Western hemisphere,
North American continent.
Looks like a missile complex in central Montana.
Missile complex.
The date.
Data, I need to know the exact date.
April 4th, 2063.
- April 4th, the day before first contact.
- Precisely.
Then the missile complex must be where Zefram Cochrane is building his warp ship.
That's what they came here to do, stop first contact.
How much damage, Lieutenant?
Can't tell.
Long-range sensors are still off-line.
We have to go down there, find out what happened.
Data, Beverly, you're with me.
Have a security team meet us in Transporter Room 3.
Computer, mid-21st century civilian clothing.
Number One, you have the Bridge.
Over here.
They're all dead.
See if one of them is Cochrane.
Data, let's go check the warp ship.
The structural integrity of the missile appears to be intact, but there is significant damage to various sections of the fuselage and primary intercooler system.
We should have the original blueprints in the Enterprise computer.
Commander La Forge will need to bring a team down here...
- Hold your fire! We're here to help you!
- Bullshit!
Captain, I believe I can handle this.
Greetings.
Captain, this woman requires medical attention.
Severe theta radiation poisoning.
Radiation is coming from the damaged throttle assembly.
We're all gonna have to be inoculated,
- and I have to get her to Sickbay.
- Doctor...
Please, no lectures about the Prime Directive.
I will keep her unconscious.
Very well. Tell Commander Riker to beam down with a search party.
We need to find Cochrane.
Crusher to Enterprise, two to beam directly to Sickbay.
We have less than 14 hours before this ship has to be launched.
- Picard to Engineering.
- La Forge here.
Geordi, Cochrane's ship was damaged in the attack.
Get down here with an engineering detail. We have work to do.
Right. I'm on my way, Captain.
Alpha team, let's assemble in Transporter Room 3.
We're heading down to the surface.
Porter, you're gonna be in command till I get back.
- Aye, sir.
- And, Porter, check out the environmental controls while I'm gone.
It's getting a little warm in here.
All right, let's go.
Looks like a good spot right here.
Isn’t it amazing?
This ship used to be a nuclear missile.
It is an historical irony that Dr. Cochrane would choose an instrument of mass destruction to inaugurate an era of peace.
It's a boyhood fantasy, Data.
I must've seen this ship hundreds of times in the Smithsonian, but I was never able to touch it.
Sir, does tactile contact alter your perception of the Phoenix?
Oh, yes.
For humans, touch can connect you to an object in a very personal way, make it seem more real.
I am detecting imperfections in the titanium casing, temperature variations in the fuel manifold.
It is no more real to me now than it was a moment ago.
Would you three like to be alone?
What have you found out?
There's no sign of Cochrane anywhere in the complex.
He has to be here.
There was nothing more important to him than this ship.
This flight, it was his dream.
Captain, we should consider the possibility that Dr. Cochrane was killed in the attack.
If that's true, then the future may die with him.
What do you think?
It's like the entire environmental system's gone crazy.
It's not just Engineering.
It's the entire deck.
Maybe it's a problem with the EPS conduits.
Hello?
- Hey!
- Are you talking to me?
Is there anyone else working maintenance in this section?
Not that I know of.
Paul?
Paul? Are you okay in there?
Captain? What is it?
Picard to Enterprise.
Mr. Worf, is everything all right up there?
Yes, sir. We are experiencing some environmental difficulties on Deck 16, but that is all.
- What kind of difficulties?
- Humidity levels have risen 73% and the temperature has jumped
10 degrees in the last hour.
- Mr. Data and I are returning to the ship.
- Understood.
- Number One, take charge down here.
- Aye, sir.
Damage to her cell membranes is repaired.
She should be fine, but I'd like to run another test on her spinal tissue.
And find out why it's so hot in here.
Now what?
Crusher to Engineering.
Crusher to Bridge.
Commander Worf, I need to know exactly what's been happening.
We just lost contact with Deck 16.
Communications, internal sensors, everything.
I was about to send a security team to investigate.
No! Seal off Deck 16.
Post security teams at every access point.
- Aye, sir.
- Mr. Hawk.
Before we lost internal sensors, what were the exact environmental conditions in Main Engineering?
Atmospheric pressure was two kilopascals above normal, ninety-two percent humidity,
39.1 degrees Celsius.
Thirty-nine-point-one degrees Celsius.
Like a Borg ship.
They knew their ship was doomed.
Our shields were down.
Somehow they transported over here without being detected.
They'll assimilate the Enterprise, and then Earth.
Picard to Riker.
Enterprise to away team.
Respond!
Sir, main control is being rerouted through Main Engineering.
Weapons, shields, propulsion.
Quickly, Mr. Data!
Lock out the main computer!
I have isolated the main computer with a fractal encryption code.
It is highly unlikely the Borg will be able to break it.
The Borg have cut primary power to all decks except 16.
The Borg won't stay on Deck 16.
Wake up. You're all right.
Come on. Come on. Wake up.
Take it easy. Stay calm.
You are all right!
- Now, listen to me. Look at me.
- No!
You are gonna be fine.
I need you to do as I say.
Alyssa, is the EMH program still online?
- It should be.
- That's it. That's a girl.
I swore I'd never use one of these.
Computer, activate the EMH program.
Please state the nature of the medical emergency.
Twenty Borg are about to break through that door.
We need time to get out of here.
Create a diversion!
This isn't part of my program.
I'm a doctor, not a doorstop.
Well, do a dance, tell a story.
I don't care. Just give us a few seconds.
According to Starfleet medical research,
Borg implants can cause severe skin irritations.
Perhaps you'd like an analgesic cream?
Which way?
We need to get off this deck.
Follow me.
First thing they'll do in Engineering is establish a collective, a central point from which they can control the hive.
The problem is, if we begin firing particle weapons in Engineering, there's a risk that we may hit the warp core.
I believe our goal should be to puncture one of the plasma coolant tanks.
- Data?
- Excellent idea.
Plasma coolant will liquefy organic material on contact.
But the Borg are not entirely organic.
True, but like all cybernetic life-forms, they cannot survive without their organic components.
I have ordered all weapons to be set on a rotating modulation.
The Borg will adapt quickly.
We will be able to fire 12 shots at most.
One other thing.
You may encounter
Enterprise crew members who've already been assimilated.
Don't hesitate to fire.
Believe me, you'll be doing them a favor.
Let's go.
Deanna! Deanna!
No, no! Don't turn off the...
Who is this jerk?
Who told him he could turn off my music?
Will Riker, Zefram Cochrane.
- Is he a friend of yours?
- Yes.
- Husband?
- No.
Good.
- Now, this, Deena...
- Deanna.
- This is the good stuff.
- Dr. Cochrane...
To the Phoenix, may she rest in peace.
Okay, that wasn't so good.
Will, I think we have to tell him the truth.
- If we tell the truth, the timeline...
- Timeline?
This is no time to argue about time.
We don't have the time.
- What was I saying?
- You're drunk.
- I am not!
- Yes, you are.
Look, he wouldn't even talk to me unless I had a drink with him.
And then it took three shots of something called tequila just to find out he was the one we're looking for.
And I've spent the last 20 minutes trying to keep his hands off me.
So don't go criticizing my counseling technique.
Sorry.
It's a primitive culture.
- I'm just trying to blend in.
- You're blended, all right.
I already told him our cover story.
He didn't believe me.
We are running out of time.
Now, if we tell him the truth, do you think he'll be able to handle it?
If you're looking for my professional opinion as ship's counselor,
- he's nuts.
- I'll be sure to note that in my log.
Captain, I believe I am feeling anxiety.
It is an intriguing sensation.
A most distracting...
Data, I'm sure it's a fascinating experience, but perhaps you should deactivate your emotion chip for now.
Good idea, sir.
Done.
Data, there are times that I envy you.
It's only me!
- Doctor, are you all right?
- Yes, but we have wounded here.
Lopez, get these people back to Deck 14.
There was a civilian, a woman from the 21st century.
- We got separated.
- We will watch for her.
Worf, she has no idea what's going on.
Try to find her.
Lower your weapons.
They'll ignore us till they consider us a threat.
The manual release.
Mr. Worf, hold this position.
Manual release is online.
Perhaps we should just knock.
Data.
Ready phasers!
Data, cover me.
Captain, they've adapted!
Regroup on Deck 15.
Don't let them touch you!
- Captain!
- Data!
Here!
Captain!
Help.
Please, help.
- You! How the hell did you...
- Back off!
- Calm down!
- Shut up!
- Who are you?
- My name is Jean-Luc Picard...
No! Who are you with? What faction?
I'm not a member of the Eastern Coalition. Listen...
I said shut up!
I don't care who you're with.
Get me the hell out of here.
Now!
That isn't going to be easy.
Well, you better find a way to make it easy, soldier, or I'm gonna start pushing buttons.
All right!
- Follow me.
- Slow!
Your efforts to break the encryption codes will not be successful.
Nor will your attempts to assimilate me into your collective.
Brave words.
I've heard them before, from thousands of species across thousands of worlds since long before you were created.
But now, they are all Borg.
I am unlike any life-form you have encountered before.
The codes stored in my neural net cannot be forcibly removed.
You are an imperfect being created by an imperfect being.
Finding your weakness is only a matter of time.
Let me just make sure that I understand you correctly,
Commander.
A group of cybernetic creatures from the future have traveled back through time to enslave the human race,
- and you're here to stop them?
- That's right.
Hot damn. You're heroic.
We're gonna prove it to you. Geordi!
- There she is. Beautiful!
- Here we go.
- All right, take a look.
- Well, well, well.
What do we got here?
I love a good peep show.
That's a trick.
- How'd you do that?
- It's your telescope.
That's our ship, the Enterprise.
- And Lily's up there right now?
- That's right.
Can I talk to her?
We've lost contact with the Enterprise.
We don't know why yet.
So, what is it you want me to do?
Simple. Conduct your warp flight tomorrow morning just as you planned.
Why tomorrow morning?
Because at 11:00 an alien ship will begin passing through this solar system.
Alien. You mean extraterrestrials?
- More bad guys?
- Good guys.
They're on a survey mission.
They have no interest in Earth.
Too primitive.
Doctor, tomorrow morning, when they detect the warp signature from your ship and realize that humans have discovered how to travel faster than light, they decide to alter their course.
They make first contact with Earth, right here.
- Here?
- Actually, over there.
It is one of the pivotal moments in human history, Doctor.
You get to make first contact with an alien race, and after you do, everything begins to change.
Your theories on warp drive allow fleets of starships to be built, and mankind to start exploring the galaxy.
It unites humanity in a way that no one ever thought possible when they realize they're not alone in the universe.
Poverty, disease, war, they'll all be gone within the next 50 years.
But unless you make that warp flight tomorrow morning before 11:15, none of it will happen.
And you people, you're all astronauts on some kind of star trek.
Look, Doc, I know this is a lot for you to take in, but we're running out of time here.
We need your help.
What do you say?
Why not?
It's pretty bad, sir.
It looks like they control
Decks 26 up to 11.
But when they took Deck 11, they just stopped.
The Borg have assimilated more than half the ship in a matter of hours.
Why stop there? What is on Deck 11?
Hydroponics, stellar cartography, deflector control.
- No vital system.
- They would not have stopped there unless it gave them a tactical advantage.
Return to your checkpoint.
- Send reports every 10 minutes.
- Right, sir.
Something must've happened in Sickbay.
Where are Dr. Crusher and the others?
Why did you break the cease-fire?
- We didn't attack you!
- Who did?
There's a new faction that wants to prevent your launch tomorrow morning, but we are here to help you.
This may be difficult for you to accept, but you are not in Montana anymore.
You're on a ship, a spaceship orbiting the Earth at an altitude of...
You wanna help me, get me out of here.
All right.
You want a way out. Here it is.
What is this?
Australia, New Guinea, the Solomons.
Montana will be up soon, but you may want to hold your breath.
It's a long way down.
Now, listen to me. I'm not your enemy, and I can get you home, but first you must put that weapon down and trust me.
Jean-Luc Picard.
My name. That's my name.
What's yours?
Lily.
Welcome aboard, Lily.
Thank you.
Maximum setting. If you'd fired this, you would've vaporized me.
It's my first ray gun.
There's no glass.
Force field.
I've never seen that kind of technology.
That's because it hasn't been invented yet.
What?
There's more I have to tell you.
Come on.
Are you ready?
- Who are you?
- I am the Borg.
That is a contradiction. The Borg have a collective consciousness.
There are no individuals.
I am the beginning, the end, the one who is many.
I am the Borg.
Greetings.
I am curious.
Do you control the Borg collective?
You imply a disparity where none exists.
I am the collective.
Perhaps I should rephrase the question.
I wish to understand the organizational relationships.
Are you their leader?
I bring order to chaos.
An interesting if cryptic response.
You are in chaos, Data.
You are the contradiction.
A machine who wishes to be human.
Since you seem to know so much about me, you must be aware that I am programmed to evolve, to better myself.
We, too, are on a quest to better ourselves, evolving toward a state of perfection.
Forgive me, but the Borg do not evolve.
They conquer.
By assimilating other beings into our collective, we are bringing them closer to perfection.
Somehow, I question your motives.
That is because you haven't been properly stimulated yet.
You have reactivated my emotion chip.
- Why?
- Don't be frightened.
I am not frightened.
Do you know what this is, Data?
It would appear you are attempting to graft organic skin onto my endoskeletal structure.
What a cold description for such a beautiful gift.
Was that good for you?
How many planets are in this Federation?
Over 150, spread across 8,000 light-years.
You must not get home much.
Actually, I tend to think of this ship as home.
But if it's Earth you're talking about,
I try to get back whenever I can.
Good. They haven't broken the encryption codes yet.
Who, those bionic zombies you told me about? The...
- Borg.
- Borg? Sounds Swedish.
- How big is this ship?
- There are 24 decks, almost 700 meters long.
It took me six months to scrounge up enough titanium just to build a four-meter cockpit.
How much did this thing cost?
The economics of the future are somewhat different.
You see, money doesn't exist in the 24th century.
No money?
You mean you don't get paid?
The acquisition of wealth is no longer the driving force in our lives.
We work to better ourselves and the rest of humanity.
Actually, we're rather like yourself and Dr. Cochrane.
All right! All right.
- Come on.
- Is there another way around?
I know what I'm doing.
Definitely not Swedish.
What the hell are you doing?
Perhaps something in satin?
I'm sorry, gentlemen, but we're closing.
And you do understand we have a strict dress code, so if you boys don't leave right now, I'll...
I'm looking for Nicky the Nose.
The Nose?
He hasn't been here in months.
This is the wrong chapter.
Computer! Begin chapter 13.
Try and look as if you're having a good time.
No, no, no, look at me!
Try to act naturally.
There he is.
Ruby, this is not a good time.
It's never the time for us, is it, Dix?
Always some excuse,
- some case you're working on.
- I have to talk to Nicky. I'll see you later.
Okay, but watch your caboose.
And dump the broad.
Well, well, well.
Look what the cat dragged in.
What's shaking, Dix?
The usual, Nick. Martinis and skirts.
Excuse me.
Hey, I'm going to take that personal in a second.
No offense.
Hey!
Hey!
I think you got him.
I don't get it.
I thought you said this was all just a bunch of holograms.
- If it's holograms...
- I disengaged the safety protocols.
Without them, even a holographic bullet can kill.
- What are you doing?
- I'm looking for the neuroprocessor.
Every Borg has one.
It's like a memory chip.
It will contain a record of all the instructions this Borg has been receiving from the collective.
Oh, my.
Jean-Luc, it's one of your uniforms.
Yes, this was Ensign Lynch.
Tough luck, huh?
I've gotta get to the Bridge.
Good morning, sir.
Doctor?
- Yeah?
- Would you mind taking a look at this?
Yeah.
I tried to reconstruct the intermix chamber from what I remember in school.
Tell me if I got it right.
School?
- You learned about this in school?
- Oh, yeah.
Basic Warp Design is a required course at the Academy.
The first chapter is called
"Zefram Cochrane."
Well, it looks like you got it right.
Commander, this is what we're thinking of using to replace the damaged warp plasma conduit.
Yeah, Reg. Yeah, that's good, but you need to reinforce this copper tubing with a nanopolymer.
Dr. Cochrane, I know this sounds silly, but can I shake your hand?
Thank you, Doctor.
I can't tell you what an honor it is to work with you on this project.
- Reg.
- I never imagined that I'd be meeting
- the man who invented warp drive. I...
- Reg!
I'm sorry. Right. Thanks.
Do they have to keep doing that?
It's just a little hero worship, Doc.
To tell you the truth,
I can't say I blame them.
We all grew up hearing about what you did here.
Or what you're about to do.
You know,
I probably shouldn't even tell you this, but I went to Zefram Cochrane High School.
Really?
You know, I wish I had a picture of this.
- What?
- Well, you see, in the future, this whole area becomes an historical monument.
You're standing almost on the exact spot where your statue's gonna be.
- Statue?
- Oh, yeah!
It's marble, about 20 meters tall, and you're looking up at the sky, and your hand's sort of reaching toward the future.
I gotta take a leak.
Leak? I'm not detecting any leak.
Don't you people from the 24th century ever pee?
Leak! I get it.
That's pretty funny.
Excuse me.
Commander?
- Captain.
- Jean-Luc.
Reports of my assimilation are greatly exaggerated.
I found something you lost.
- I am a Klingon.
- Mr. Worf, report.
The Borg control over half the ship.
We have tried to restore power to the Bridge and the weapon systems,
- but we have been unsuccessful.
- We have another problem.
I've accessed a Borg neuroprocessor, and I've discovered what they're trying to do.
They're transforming the deflector dish into an interplexing beacon.
Interplexing?
It's a subspace transmitter.
If they activate the beacon, they'll be able to establish a link with the Borg living in this century.
But in the 21st century, the Borg are still in the Delta Quadrant.
They'll send reinforcements.
Humanity will be an easy target.
Attack the Earth in the past to assimilate the future.
Then we must destroy the deflector dish before they can activate the beacon.
We can't get to deflector control or a shuttlecraft...
Mr. Worf, do you remember your zero-g combat training?
I remember it made me sick to my stomach.
What are you suggesting?
I think it's time that we took a little stroll.
Hang on.
There's a humanoid life-sign up ahead.
Five hundred eleven meters.
Cochrane?
It's him, all right.
I've re-modulated the pulse emitters, but I do not believe we will get more than one or two shots
- before the Borg adapt.
- Then we must make every shot count.
Magnetize.
- Watch your caboose, Dix.
- I intend to.
- How are you doing, Mr. Worf?
- Not well, sir.
Try not to look at the stars.
Keep your eyes on the hull.
Let's go.
Tell me, are you using a polymer-based neuro-relay to transmit the organic nerve impulses to the central processor of my positronic net?
If that is the case, how have you solved the problem of increased signal degradation inherent to organo-synthetic transmission...
Do you always talk this much?
Not always, but often.
Why do you insist on utilizing this primitive linguistic communication?
Your android brain is capable of so much more.
Have you forgotten? I am endeavoring to become more human.
Human. We used to be exactly like them. Flawed, weak, organic.
But we evolved to include the synthetic.
Now we use both to attain perfection.
Your goal should be the same as ours.
Believing oneself to be perfect is often the sign of a delusional mind.
Small words from a small being trying to attack what he doesn't understand.
I understand that you have no real interest in me, that your goal is to obtain the encryption codes for the Enterprise computer.
That is one of our goals, one of many.
But in order to reach it,
I am willing to help you reach yours.
Is it becoming clear to you yet?
Look at yourself, standing there, cradling the new flesh that I've given you.
If it means nothing to you, why protect it?
I am simply imitating the behavior of humans.
You're becoming more human all the time, Data.
Now you're learning how to lie.
My programming was not designed to process these sensations.
Then tear the skin from your limb as you would a defective circuit.
Go ahead, Data. We won't stop you.
Do it. Don't be tempted by flesh.
Are you familiar with physical forms of pleasure?
If you are referring to sexuality,
I am fully functional, programmed in multiple techniques.
How long has it been since you've used them?
Eight years, seven months, 16 days, four minutes, 22...
Far too long.
- We should bring reinforcements.
- There's no time.
It looks as if they're building the beacon right on top of the particle emitter.
Once all the transponder rods are in place, the beacon will be activated.
Well, if we set our phasers to full power, we can...
No. There's a risk that we hit the dish.
It's charged with antiprotons.
We could destroy half the ship.
We have to find another way.
Come on, come on.
- Doctor!
- Sir?
You still looking for the bathroom?
- I'm not going back.
- Look, Doc, we can't do this without you.
I don't care. I don't wanna be a statue.
- Doctor...
- You stay away from me.
We don't have time for this.
You told him about the statue?
For this to work, all three maglocks will have to be released.
Magnetic constrictors are disengaged.
They've adapted.
Warning. Decompression in 45 seconds.
Hawk!
We've had a change of plans, Data.
Assimilate this.
Only got an hour to go, Doc.
How you feeling?
I got a four-alarm hangover, either from the whiskey or your laser beam, or both, but I'm ready to make history.
- Troi to Commander Riker.
- Riker here.
- We're ready to open the launch door.
- Go ahead.
Look at that.
What, you don't have a moon in the 24th century?
Sure we do. It just looks a lot different.
There are 50 million people living on the moon in my time.
You can see Tycho City, New Berlin, even Lake Armstrong on a day like this.
- And you know, Doctor...
- Please!
Don't tell me it's all thanks to me.
I've heard enough about the great Zefram Cochrane.
I don't know who writes your history books or where you get your information from, but you people got some pretty funny ideas about me.
You all look at me as if I'm some kind of saint or visionary or something.
I don't think you're a saint, Doc, but you did have a vision.
And now we're sitting in it.
You wanna know what my vision is?
Dollar signs. Money.
I didn't build this ship to usher in a new era for humanity.
You think I want to go to the stars?
I don't even like to fly! I take trains!
I built this ship so that I could retire to some tropical island filled with naked women.
That's Zefram Cochrane.
That's his vision.
This other guy you keep talking about, this historical figure,
I never met him.
I can't imagine I ever will.
Someone once said, "Don't try to be a great man. Just be a man,
"and let history make its own judgments."
That's rhetorical nonsense.
- Who said that?
- You did, 10 years from now.
You got 58 minutes, Doc.
You better get on that checklist.
They're on the move again.
The Borg just overran three of our defense checkpoints.
They've taken over Decks 5 and 6.
They've adapted to every modulation of our weapons.
It's like we're shooting blanks.
We'll have to work on finding another way to modify our weapons so they'll be more effective.
In the meantime, tell your men to stand their ground.
- Sir...
- Fight hand-to-hand if they have to.
Aye, sir.
Wait.
Captain, our weapons are useless.
We must activate the auto-destruct sequence and use the escape pods to evacuate the ship.
No!
Jean-Luc, if we destroy the ship, we destroy the Borg.
We're gonna stay and fight.
Sir, we have lost the Enterprise.
We should not sacrifice...
We have not lost the Enterprise, Mr. Worf.
We are not going to lose the Enterprise.
Not to the Borg, not while I'm in command.
- You have your orders.
- I must object to this course of action.
- It is...
- The objection is noted.
With all due respect, sir,
I believe you are allowing your personal experience with the Borg to influence your judgment.
You're afraid.
You want to destroy the ship and run away. You coward.
Jean-Luc.
If you were any other man,
I would kill you where you stand.
Get off my Bridge.
- So what do we do now?
- We carry out his orders.
Dyson, Kaplan,
- start working on a way to modify...
- Wait!
...the weapon systems.
- This is stupid!
If we can get off this ship and then blow it up, let's do it!
Once the Captain's made up his mind, the discussion is over.
Lily!
- You son of a bitch.
- This really isn't the time.
Okay, I don't know jack about the 24th century, but everybody out there thinks that staying here and fighting the Borg is suicide.
They're just afraid to come in here and say it.
The crew is accustomed to following my orders.
They're probably accustomed to your orders making sense.
None of them understand the Borg as I do.
No one does.
No one can.
What is that supposed to mean?
Six years ago, they assimilated me into their collective.
I had their cybernetic devices implanted throughout my body.
I was linked to the hive mind, every trace of individuality erased.
I was one of them.
So you can imagine, my dear,
I have a somewhat unique perspective on the Borg, and I know how to fight them.
Now, if you will excuse me,
I have work to do.
I am such an idiot.
It's so simple.
The Borg hurt you, and now you're going to hurt them back.
In my century, we don't succumb to revenge.
We have a more evolved sensibility.
Bullshit! I saw the look on your face when you shot those Borg on the Holodeck.
You were almost enjoying it!
- How dare you.
- Oh, come on, Captain.
You're not the first man to get a thrill from murdering someone.
I see it all the time!
- Get out!
- Or what?
You'll kill me like you killed Ensign Lynch?
- There was no way to save him.
- You didn't even try.
Where was your evolved sensibility then?
- I don't have time for this.
- Hey.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt your little quest.
Captain Ahab has to go hunt his whale.
What?
You do have books in the 24th century?
- This is not about revenge.
- Liar!
This is about saving the future of humanity!
- Jean-Luc, blow up the damn ship!
- No!
No!
I will not sacrifice the Enterprise.
We've made too many compromises already, too many retreats.
They invade our space and we fall back.
They assimilate entire worlds and we fall back.
Not again.
The line must be drawn here.
This far, no further!
And I will make them pay for what they've done.
You broke your little ships.
See you around, Ahab.
"And he piled upon the whale's white hump
"the sum of all the rage and hate felt by his whole race.
"If his chest had been a cannon, he would have shot his heart upon it."
What?
Moby-Dick.
Actually, I never read it.
Ahab spent years hunting the white whale that crippled him, a quest for vengeance, but in the end, it destroyed him and his ship.
I guess he didn't know when to quit.
Prepare to evacuate the Enterprise.

- Active.
- Main bus?

There will be no further audio warnings.
So much for the Enterprise-E.
We barely knew her.
Think they'll build another one?
Plenty of letters left in the alphabet.
Mr. Worf.
I regret some of the things
I said to you earlier.
Some?
As a matter of fact,
I think you're the bravest man
I've ever known.
Thank you, sir.
See you on Gravett Island.
Captain.
Data?
Control to Phoenix. Final launch sequence checks are complete.
Good luck.
- Everybody ready to make some history?
- Always am.
- I think I forgot something.
- What?
I don't know. It's probably nothing.
Begin ignition sequence.
- Oh, God!
- Now I remember!
- What?
- Where is it?
- What?
- We can't lift off without it!
- Geordi, we've got to abort.
No! No, wait, I found it.
- Let's rock and roll!
Turn that down a little?
Hey! We've got a red light on the second intake valve.
Ignore it. We'll be fine.
Prepare first stage shutdown and separation on my mark. mark!
Okay, let's bring the warp core online.
You ain't seen nothing yet.
If you see Commander Riker or any of my crew, give them this.
What is it?
Orders to find a quiet corner of North America and stay out of history's way.
Well, good luck.
To both of us.
You're not leaving, are you?
Lily, when I was held captive on the Borg ship, my crew risked everything to save me.
There is someone still on this ship, and I owe him the same.
Go and find your friend.
What's wrong, Locutus?
Isn't this familiar?
Organic minds are such fragile things.
How could you forget me so quickly?
We were very close, you and I.
You can still hear our song.
Yes, I...
I remember you.
You were there all the time.
But that ship and all the Borg on it were destroyed.
You think in such three-dimensional terms.
How small you've become.
Data understands me.
Don't you, Data?
What have you done to him?
Given him what he always wanted, flesh and blood.
Let him go. He's not the one you want.
Are you offering yourself to us?
Offering myself?
That's it. I remember now.
It wasn't enough that you assimilate me.
I had to give myself freely to the Borg.
- To you.
- You flatter yourself.
I've overseen the assimilation of countless millions.
- You were no different.
- You're lying.
You wanted more than just another Borg drone.
You wanted a human being with a mind of his own who could bridge the gulf between humanity and the Borg.
You wanted a counterpart.
But I resisted.
I fought you.
You can't begin to imagine the life you denied yourself.
It's not too late.
Locutus could still be with you, just in the way you wanted, an equal.
Let Data go, and I will take my place at your side, willingly, without any resistance.
Such a noble creature, a quality we sometimes lack.
We will add your distinctiveness to our own.
Welcome home, Locutus.
Data, you are free to go.
- Data, go.
- No.
I do not wish to go.
As you can see,
I have already found an equal.
Data, deactivate the self-destruct sequence.
Data, no. Don't do it.
Data, listen to me.
Auto-destruct sequence deactivated.
Now enter the encryption codes and give me computer control.
Data!
Data.
He will make an excellent drone.
Plasma injectors are online.
Everything's looking good.
I think we're ready.
They should be out there right now.
We better break the warp barrier in the next five minutes if we're gonna get their attention.
- Nacelles are charged and ready.
- Let's do it!
Engage!
Warp field is looking good.
Structural integrity is holding.
- Speed?
- 20,000 kilometers per second.
Sweet Jesus!
Relax, Doctor. I'm sure they're just here to give us a send-off.
I am bringing the external sensors online.
Thirty seconds to warp threshold.
Approaching light-speed.
We're at critical velocity.
- Quantum torpedoes locked.
- Destroy them.
Watch your future's end.
Data!
Resistance is futile.
That should be enough.
Throttle back. Take us out of warp.
Is that Earth?
That's it.
It's so small.
It's about to get a whole lot bigger.
Captain.
Data.
Are you all right?
I would imagine I look worse than I feel.
Strange.
Part of me is sorry she is dead.
She was unique.
She brought me closer to humanity than I ever thought possible, and for a time,
I was tempted by her offer.
How long a time?
Zero-point-six-eight seconds, sir.
For an android, that is nearly an eternity.
Captain's Log, April 5th, 2063.
The voyage of the Phoenix was a success, again.
The alien ship detected the warp signature and is on its way to rendezvous with history.
My God.
They're really from another world.
And they're going to want to meet the man who flew that warp ship.
Live long and prosper.
Thanks.
I think it's time we made a discreet exit.
Riker to Enterprise, stand by to beam us up.
You gotta go?
I envy you, the world you're going to.
I envy you, taking these first steps into a new frontier.
I shall miss you, Lily.
Picard to Enterprise. Energize.
- Report.
- The moon's gravitational field obscured our warp signature.
The Vulcans did not detect us.
Captain, I've reconfigured our warp field to match the chronometric readings of the Borg sphere.
- Recreate the vortex, Commander.
- Aye, sir.
All decks report ready.
- Helm standing by.
- Mr. Data, lay in a course for the 24th century.
I suspect our future is there waiting for us.
Course laid in, sir.
Make it so.

It's the real thing.
A radio signal from another world.
Let--Let's not jump the gun here.
Get on-line with Space Command.
They're gonna want to know about--
Jeez, what's with the golf balls?
You're gonna kill me here.
Wait. wait.
This can't be right.
The calculated distance from source is only
37 5,000 kilometers.
It's coming from the moon.

Who else knows about this?
S.E.T.I. in New Mexico identified a signal, but, uh, they're even more confused than we are, sir.

Excuse me.
Major?
Yes, sir.
Radar reception has been impaired, but we were able to get these.

As a matter of fact, you did.
Liar.
I have a confession to make.
I'm sleeping next to a beautiful young brunette.
You didn't let her stay up all night watching TV... did you?
Of course not.
You're gonna come home right after the luncheon, right?
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
Mommy?
Here's your mother.
Hi, honey.
Hi. I miss you.
I know.
TV: President Whitmore's approval ratings have slipped below 40%.
Even his crime bill failed to pass.
Are the salad days over for
President Whitmore? Morton?
Leadership as a pilot in the Gulf War is completely different from leadership in politics.
Daddy let me watch
Letterman.
Traitor.
That's the problem.
They elected a warrior, and they got a wimp.
Good morning,
George.
Good morning,
Mr. President.
That game couldn't have been pretty.
Ha ha.
Thank you, sir.
Connie, you're up awfully early this morning.
They're not attacking your policies.
They're attacking your age.
" Whitmore seems less like the president and more like the orphan child Oliver asking, 'Please, sir,
I'd like some more.'"
That's clever.
Yeah, well,
I'm not laughing.
Age was never an issue when you stuck to your guns.
You were thought of as young, idealistic.
Now the message has gotten lost.
It's just too much politics.
It's too much compromise.
Isn't it amazing how quickly everyone can turn against you?
It's a fine line between standing behind a principle and hiding behind one.
You can tolerate a little compromise if you're actually managing to get something accomplished.
Well... the Orange County Dispatch has voted you one of the 10 sexiest men... of the year.
That's...
That's accomplishing something.
Excuse me, Mr. President.
It's the secretary of defense.
Yes.
Can you say that again?

He'll give us a traffic report to the beaches...
So why are you waiting? Hmm?
My social security will expire, you'll still be sitting there.
I'm thinking.
Yeah, well, think already.
Dad, do you have any idea how long it takes for those cups to decompose?
If you don't move soon,
I'm gonna start to decompose.
OK.
Ah. Ah.
Listen, David,
I've been meaning to talk with you.
It's nice that you see me so much now, but--
Don't--Don't start, Dad.
I'm only saying it's been, what, four years?
You're still wearing your wedding band?
Three years.
All right, three, four.
You're divorced.
Come on, move on.
This is not healthy.
No, this is not healthy.
Smoking is not healthy.

Hello.
What's the, uh...
What's the big emergency?
It started this morning.
Every station's making like it's the 1950s.
We got static.
We got snow.
All kinds of distortions.
- Nobody knows--
- Marty--
What the hell are you doing?
There's a reason we have bins labeled " recycle."
What the hell is going on?
My God in heaven.
So sue me. David!
We got a problem.
Did you try to switch transponder channels?
Oh, please.
You think I'd be this panicked if it was something simple?
OK. Let's point the dish at another satellite.
We tried that.
It didn't work.
It's almost as though they weren't even there.
All right. All right.
What've we got here?
This is impossible.
TV: We created a race of robots.
Their function...
Miguel, the signal's all screwed up.
Stop it.
Just leave it alone.
You're gonna break it, all right?
It's so fuzzy.

Oh, no.
Good morning, Lucas.
You see these?

Hey!

Hey, Miguel!
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Whoaaaa!

Yahhhh-hoooo!

Whoo!
Just what in the hell do you think you're doing?
Whoa! Ohh!
Oh!

CNS is running a story that we're covering up some type of nuclear testing experiment.
Tell them to run with it if they want to embarrass themselves.
NASA's been on my butt all morning.
They want to know our position.
Our official position is we have no official position.
Connie, what is going on here?
Come on, would I keep you out of the loop?
- Yes, absolutely.
- In a second.
What? I can't hear you.
At the moment, our satellites are somewhat unreliable.
Isn't it possible that this thing may just pass us by?
What if it doesn't
"pass us by" ?
Let's retarget some ICBMs to blow it outta the sky.
And risk turning one dangerous falling object into many?
We don't yet know enough about what we're dealing with to make any kind of intelligent judgments.
Luckily, the press is making up their own story at this point.
But that's not gonna keep.
We may need to upgrade to Defcon Three.
Absolutely.
General, contact NORAD.
You tell them we've upgraded to Defcon Three.
That's not what the president said.
That's a little premature.
I don't think so.
We have more than 50% of the armed forces out on weekend leave, not to mention the commanders and troops that are in town for the 4th ofJuly parade.
Go ahead, Commander.
Our intelligence tells us the object has settled into a stationary orbit.
Well, that's good news.
Uh, not really, sir.
Part of it has broken off into nearly three dozen other pieces... smaller than the whole, sir, yet over 15 miles in width themselves.
Where are they heading?
They should be entering our atmosphere within the next 25 minutes.
Take us to Defcon Three.
[Beeping]
[Beeping]
Please tell me we're gettin' somewhere.
Oh, there's good news, and there's bad news.
All right, what's the bad news?
The bad news is that you're in meal penalty for disturbing my lunch.
And the good news is you're not gonna charge me.
Uh, no. The good news is that I've found the problem.
It's not our equipment.
There's some kinda weird signal embedded in the satellite feed.
And that's the good news?
Yeah, 'cause this signal has a definite sequential pattern, so as soon as I find the exact binary sequence, then I can calculate the phase reversal with that analyzer
I built you for your birthday and apply it, we should be able to block it out completely.
And then we'll be the only guys in town with a clear picture?!
Yes! Yes! Yes!
Oh, David, that's why I love you!
I know.
That's unnecessary.
Oh, yes! Yes!
You're too kind.
[Rumbling]
This better be good.
Captain on deck!
Sir, we're looking at a total radar blackout over a 13 kilometer area.
Let's do a diagnostic check--
Excuse me, sir.
The radar may be malfunctioning, but the infrared is totally off the map.
Jeez.
Get me Atlantic Command on the line.
Hang on, sir.
Sir, we have visual range with incoming over Iraqi airspace.
Second sighting?
Yes, sir. This just came in from the Persian Gulf.
Correction, sir.
We now have two confirmed visual contacts.
That's affirmative.
Mr. President.
They're tracking another one off the California coastline.
[Whispers]
All right, go ahead.
Put it on.
General, you might want to watch this.
TV: Ladies and gentlemen... ladies and gentlemen, we are interrupting our regular broadcast to bring you extraordinary events taking place in the Russian Republic.
This unexplained disturbance and the hysteria that it's causing are incredible.
Woman: How would you describe what you're seeing?
It is clearing the mountains... moving too slowly to be a comet or meteor.
Widespread panic has gripped the countryside as thousands have taken to the streets.
It is confirmed.
The unexplained phenomenon is headed for Moscow.
Mr. President, we have an AWAC off the West Coast.
ETA with contact point: three minutes.
I don't understand it, sir.
Side radar doesn't see it.
I know. It's blind, sir.
Nothing is registering.
Negative.
We have zero visibility.
Visibility is at... zero.
Command, this is
Eagle Eye 37 0.
General Grey: Captain, the president is listening.
Repeat what you just told me.
We still have zero visibility.
Instrumentation is malfunctioning.
[Static]
We can't get any kind of reading of what's in front of us.
Wait a minute.
[Static]
May be clearing.
Pull up! Pull up!
- Aah!
- Aah!
Line's gone, sir.
Two more have been spotted over the Atlantic.
One's moving toward New York, the other's headed this direction.
How much time do we have?
Less than 10 minutes.
Alex, organize a military escort.
Mr. President,
I strongly recommend we move you to a secure location immediately.
Connie, can we expect the same kind of panic we saw in Russia?
More than likely.
We can discuss this on the way.
I'm not leaving.
We have to maintain a working government...
I want you to get the vice president, the whole cabinet, and joint chiefs, and take them to a secured location.
I'm staying.
I don't want to add to a public hysteria that's gonna cost lives.
Connie.
Yes, sir?
We'll initiate the Emergency
Broadcast System.
We'll advise people not to panic.
The best idea right now is to stay in their homes.
Yes, sir.
Roy. Dean.
And, Alex, you contact the cabinet members.
Have them rendezvous here.
We'll take them to NORAD.
Mr. President, with your permission,
I'd like to remain at your side.
I had a feeling you would.
And what happens if they do become hostile?
Then God help us.
There it is, the strange atmospheric phenomenon.
It is apparently what has been causing all the distortions in our broadcasts.
David, are you watching this?
General Grey On TV:
Not to react in a manner of cold fear.
We have no evidence that these phenomena are endangering anyone.
Thus far, reports of aggression...
Marty, listen to this.
I got a lock on the pattern of that signal, so we can filter it out.
But if my calculations are right, it's going to be gone in, like, seven hours anyway.
It's reducing itself every time it recycles, so eventually it's gonna disappear...
You listening?
Can you believe this?
David, haven't you been watching?
David!
TV: General.
Good afternoon.
So far, the phenomenon has not caused any damage.
We have to ask you to try to stay calm, and it's important for everyone not to panic.
We have a fix on three of the occurrences about to appear over American cities.
It's just unreal.
Hey, Miguel, come here.
TV: One is headed towards Los Angeles.
The other two are on our eastern seaboard headed towards New York and Washington, D.C. headed towards New York and Washington, D.C.
Marty.
Marty.Jamie says this building has an old bomb shelter.
We're heading down there now.
All right. Um, everybody, head down to the basement.
Take it slow.
Don't run.
Walk down to the basement.
There's no shame in hiding.
Oh, I better call my mother.
- Hoo hoo!
- Ha ha ha!
Well, look who we have here.
Hey, Russ, I heard you had a little trouble this morning.
Dusted the wrong field.
I know you're probably still a little confused from your hostage experience.
Hostage experience?
Did something happen to you, Russ?
Oh, yeah. Seems years back, our boy was kidnapped by aliens.
Did all kinds of experiments on him.
Tell them about it,
Russ.
Get a couple beers in him, he'll tell you all about it.
Crazy stuff.
Won't you, Russ?
Russ... when they took you up in their spaceship, did they do any... sexual things, do you recall?
Do you recollect?
Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!
Oh, Russ!
Ha ha ha ha ha!

Address the nation.
There's gonna be a lot of frightened people out there.
Yeah.
I'm one of them.
Hey, hey, hey.
Come on.

If you want to impress me, you need to get a job and stop slobbering all over my shoe.
[Urinating]
I don't believe this.

Guess they finally got tired of all these quakes.
[Urinating]
A little shake, and they running.
TV: Police and the fire departments are asking everyone to stay off the phone.
Baby, there's something on the news about the quake.
TV: The police are asking us not to call 911.
What's up, man?
What you been doing out there?
Shooting the aliens.
Oh, you shooting aliens, right?
You think you tough, huh?
What you got? Turn around.
Let me see what you got.
Come on, Boomer.
Let's get you something to eat.
Mmm. Uh, nnnnn...
Oh, now, watch out.
Watch it now, baby.
I'll go grab the paper.
All right.
Ow!
Darn--
Man: Honey, let's go!
Babe, you want some of this coffee?
Babe.
Boom! Boom! Boom!
Newscaster On TV:
Pentagon officials are reporting more ships have just arrived over the capitals of India,
England, and Germany, bringing estimates up to anywhere from 10 to 15 of these city-sized spacecraft.
I know, Ma.
Just try and stay calm.
Tell her to pack up and leave town.
Why? What happened?
Just do it!
Oh, Ma.
Ma, listen.
Get your stuff together and head for Aunt Esther's.
Don't argue with me.
Just go!
David, why did I just send my mother to Atlanta?
David.
David, talk to me.
Did you hear me tell you that the signal hidden in the satellite feed is slowly recycling down to extinction?
Not really.
It's a countdown.
A countdown?
Wait. A countdown to what, David?
Uh, it's like in chess:
First you strategically position your pieces, then, when the timing's right, you strike.
See?
They're positioning themselves all over the world using this one signal to synchronize their efforts.
In approximately six hours, the signal's going to disappear, and the countdown's going to be over.
And then what?
Checkmate.
[Gasp]
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!
I've got to call my brother.
I'd better call my housekeeper.
I gotta call my lawyer.
Eh, forget my lawyer.
Announcer On TV:
Ladies and gentlemen, the president of the United States.
Good afternoon.
My fellow Americans, a historic and unprecedented event has occurred.
The question of whether or not we're alone in the universe has been answered.
Although it's understandable that many of us feel a sense of hesitation or even fear, we must attempt to reserve judgment...
He says he's your husband.
Oh, God.
What do you want?
You got to leave the White House.
[Whispering] This is hardly the time nor the place to be having that same old discussion!
You don't understand.
You got to leave
Washington.
Well, in case you haven't noticed, we are having a little crisis here.
They're communicating with a hidden signal.
They're going to attack.
You are just being paranoid!
Shh!
It's not paranoia.
The embedding's very subtle.
It's probably been overlooked. If--
[Dial Tone]
Marty, what are you doing?
Get out of town as soon as you can.
- Please.
- OK, OK.
TV: My staff and I will remain in the White House as we attempt to establish communication.
If you feel compelled to leave these cities, please do so in an orderly fashion.
Hey! What's going on?
Excuse me.
Coming through.
TV: The arrival of the alien visitors has caused over 10,000 fender-benders in just a few seconds' time, but this is just the beginning...
Uh-uh. Come on, now, you can't go.
Uh-uh. Come on, now, you can't go.
You got to call them back.
I'm not going to do this with you,Jasmine.
I've got to report to El Toro.
But you said you was on leave for the 4th.
Yeah, well, they canceled it!
Look, why are you acting like this?
Why?
That's why.
Look...
I really don't think they flew 90 billion light years to come down here and start a fight and get all rowdy.
Look, why don't you just relax?
I'm going to report to El Toro and find out what's going on.
[Dylan Imitating
Engine Running]
What are you doing in there, man?
Nothing.
I'm just driving.
[Imitating Engine]
Honk honk!
Look. Here,
I got these for you.
Firecrackers.
Now, you be careful.
Steve, wait.
I want to tell you something.
What is it,Jasmine?
You take care of yourself, you hear?
Look, um... why don't you get some things packed, and you and Dylan come stay with me on the base.
And you will see that there is nothing to be scared of.
Really?
You don't mind?
Well, I mean, uh...
We'll have to let all my other girlfriends know that they can't come over, you know, and got to postpone a little freaky-deaky.
There you go.
There he goes, thinking you all that.
But you are not as charming as you think you are, sir.
Yes, I am.
Them big ol' Dumbo ears.
Well, look at you with them chicken legs.
Baw-caw.
Come on, Dylan, honey.
[Shouting And Screaming]
Look out!
Look out!
- What?
- Hey!
The television said they started the looting already.
Vultures.
You still have the Plymouth?
You want to borrow the car?
David, you don't have a license.
You're driving.
Yeah, I'm driv--I'm driving?
Come on, come on.
I really want you out of Los Angeles.
You're staying there to keep people calm.
It's the right thing to do.
I'm not going to let them criticize you for it.
I appreciate your trying to help me.
Liar. Stick to the truth.
It's what you're good at.
All right.
I'll tell you the truth.
I don't want you in any one of those cities.
[Sigh]
I'll leave as soon as the interviews are done.
All right. There's a helicopter waiting.
They're going to take you to Nellis.
Marilyn: And the munchkin?
She's going to meet you there.
All right.
I love you.
I love you.
Bye.
TV: Communication attempts in 30 languages over all common frequencies have failed.
Bye.
Julius:
It's the White House, for crying out loud.
You can't just drive up and ring a bell.
Can't this thing go any faster?
What, you think they don't know what you know?
They know.
Believe me, they know.
She works for the president.
They know everything.
They don't know this.
Oh, oh. You're going to educate them, huh?
So tell me something.
You're so smart, how come you spend eight years at M.I.T. to become a cable repairman?
All I'm saying is they got people who handle these things,
David.
They want HBO, they'll call you.
Look at these people.
Look. Huh?
Vultures.
They take, and then they go.
Yeah. They're going.
They're going faster than we are.
Look at this.
We're in the fast lane.
They're cutting me off here.
No one's cutting you off.
We're going to get a ticket.
They're getting in front of me.
I can't go any faster.
All right. All right.
I don't want to argue.
Let's just get there as quickly as possible.
What's the rush?
You think we'll get to Washington, it won't be there?
Newscaster On TV:
A local crop duster was arrested today as he papered city hall with leaflets from the air.
Everybody's leaving.
TV: Can you give us some of your time?
Do you want to make a statement?
We've got to stop them!
I was kidnapped by space aliens 10 years ago.
They did all kinds of experiments on me.
They've been studying us for years, finding out our weaknesses.
We've gotta stop them!
They're gonna kill us all!
Newscaster: Some people attribute his eccentric behavior to post-traumatic stress syndrome from his service as a pilot in Vietnam.
Others, however, have a more unusual theory.
How would you describe Mr. Casse?
- Private.
- Keeps to himself.
- Real quiet.
- Quiet.
When they took him up in the spaceship, the aliens abused him... sexually.
Newscaster: Mr. Casse is in the county lockup this evening...
Pack up.
We're leaving.
TV: Due to extenuating circumstances, he may be released later tonight.
Miguel, what about Dad?
This could be our last night on Earth.
You don't want to die a virgin... do you?
Come on. We're going.
No. I'm not going anywhere.
Miguel!
Stop it!
Thanks a lot, partner.
You read my mind!
Stay here.
We got to get as far away from these things as we can.
They let you out?
You're damn right.
They got bigger fish to fry now, believe you me.
Come on, boy.
We're leavin'...without you.
We're going to live with Uncle Hector in Tucson.
[Scoffs]
Ha ha ha ha! Hector?
Like hell you are.
I'm still your father.
No, you're not.
You're just the man who married my mother.
You're nothin' to me.
Oh.
Oh...
Well, what about Troy?
Troy?
Yeah.
For once in your life, why don't you think about what's best for him?
Just who in the hell has to beg for money to buy him medicine when you screw up, huh?! Who?! Who?!
You stop it right now!
I'm not a baby anymore!
And I don't want your stupid medicine,
'cause I'm so sick of medicine!
Do you know what this stuff costs?
Do you want to get sick again?
Do you?
TV: Once again, the L.A.P.D. is asking Los Angelenos
TV: Once again, the L.A.P.D. is asking Los Angelenos not to fire their guns at the visitor spacecraft.
You may inadvertently trigger an interstellar war.
Think we can find something better to do with our time, gentlemen?
Where you been, Stevie?
Man, this is unbelievable.
This is, like, huge.
They've recalled everybody.
Oh. Well, looks like the mail's still working.
Oh. Oh, oh.
Uh, you got to do the honors for me, man.
You're a wuss.
Yeah, whatever.
Shut up and read it.
It says...
" Captain
Steven Hiller," loser.
" United States
Marine Corps..."
Blah blah blah blah blah blah.
" We regret to inform you that despite your excellent record of service...''
I'm sorry, man.
You know what you need to do?
You need to, like, kiss some serious booty to get ahead in this world, man.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
See, I like the one-knee approach because it puts the booty, like, right in front of the lips--
[Clatter]
What's this?
- That's nothing.
- Hold on.
Hold on, man.
What is this?
Jasmine kind of has a thing for dolphins.
I don't know.
Stevie, this is a wedding ring.
I thought you said you were going to break the whole thing off.
Yeah...
Man, you know I really likeJasmine.
You know that, right?
Man, you're never going to get to fly the Space Shuttle if you marry a stripper.
[Exotic Music
Playing Loudly]
Barry Nolan On TV:
..." it could only happen in California" file, here's Wendy Walsh with a special report.
Wendy Walsh: Below us, we can see hundreds of UFO fanatics who have gathered on rooftops here in downtown Los Angeles to welcome the new arrivals.
Oh, God! I hope they bring back Elvis!
I just came in to get my check tonight, and I got talked into working.
Oh, I must have been tripping.
TV: It's being called the party event of the century, and everyone is invited, especially you know who.
This is so cool.
Girl, please.
Oh, hey. I made it before I came in tonight.
Check it out.
Now I know you're not thinking about joining those idiots.
Oh, I am going over there as soon as I get off.
You want to come?
Tiffany, listen to me a sec.
I have got a really bad feeling about this.
I don't want you to go.
Oh, like the really bad feeling you got when I went to Las Vegas?
Yeah, and I was right.
You didn't get the job, and you lost all your money gambling.
Yeah, but I wasn't in L.A. for the earthquake.
Tiff, I really don't want you to go up there.
Now promise me you won't.
Oh.
Come on, girl, promise me.
I promise.
OK.
Look...I'm goin'.
I'm out of town for a while.
Later.
Bye.
Hey, there's my angel.
Come on.
Come on, Boomer.
Let's go, y'all.
Hey. Come on. Talk to your boyfriend later.
Hey, what the hell is the kid doin' here, huh--Oh!
You try finding a sitter today.
Hey, where do you think you're goin'?
You leave, you're fired.
Nice workin' with ya, Mario.
Come on, Boomer.
Everyone in the world is trying to get out of Washington.
We're the only schmucks trying to get in.
Radio:...should establish some line of communication.
What the hell is that?
Pops, this is every phone book in America.
You think an important person like Constance is going to be listed?
She always keeps her portable phone listed for emergencies.
Sometimes it's just her first initial.
Sometimes it's her nickname.
Sometimes it's just her--
Oy, my God!
Hey, hey, hey!
Slow it down!
Tell them!
Where are they going, all these people?!
- Stop!
- Tell them! Tell them!
Slow it down!
[Screeching Tires
And Honking Horns]
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Slow it down!
Watch out, boy!
All right! We made it!
We made it!
My goodness.
Nice driving, Pops.
Well...
So, not listed, huh?
No, no. I just haven't found it yet.
Um...I tried C. Spano and Connie Spano...
Spunky Spano...
Spunky?
College nickname.
Ah...cute.
You try Levinson?
No. She didn't take my name when we were married.
Uh, why would she--
What are you talking about?
Try it.
It isn't here. Look.
Uh-huh. So what do I know, hmm?
[Angry Shouting]
[Police Radio Traffic]
[Demonstrators Chanting]
So...you want to ring the bell or should I?
[Busy Signal]
[Gasps]
Hmm?
Oh, perfect.
She's using it.
Perfect. What's perfect?
It's busy.
Yeah. I can use her signal to triangulate to triangulate her exact position in the White House.
You can do that?
Yeah.
All cable repairmen can, Pops.
John McLaughlin On TV:
The visitors have arrived, but the president remains at the White House.
Question: Are Mr. Whitmore's actions A--ultra brave...
[Ringing] or B--foolhardy?
What?
David: Now, don't hang up, sweetie.
David. How did you get this number?
Do me a favor.
Walk to the window.
And I'm looking for what?
You'll see.
Over here.
See us?
We're here.
How does he do that?
Reporter: Reporting live from Andrews Air Force Base just outside
Washington, D.C...
Yes, that's right, Tom, an amazing moment.
We're reporting from
Andrews Air Force Base...
Now in light of our apparent inability to communicate with the visitors,
Pentagon officials have retrofit this skylift helicopter with a type of visual communications device.
Mr. President.
Be seated.
TV: This is not a military aircraft...
Where are we now?
They're just commencing liftoff.
Reporter:...and refitted with these enormous light panels that are attached to the hull and onto the sides.
Pilot: Echo One,
Welcome Wagon is in the air.
I repeat.
Welcome Wagon is in the air.
Ground Control:
Roger, Welcome Wagon.
Echo One right beside you.
This is something
I would never believe in my lifetime, that I would be in the White House.
Look at this.
If I knew I was going to meet the president,
I would have worn a tie.
I mean, look at me.
I look like a schlemiel.
You look fine, Pops.
Oy, my God.
David, I don't know how happy he's going to be to see you.
That's right.
I'm telling you, we're wasting time.
He's not going to listen to me.
We should go.
Why wouldn't he listen?
'Cause last time
I saw him, we, uh, we got into a fight.
You walked in the room and punched him in the head.
You punched the president?
He wasn't the president then.
I punched him, he fought back.
We wrestled around.
It was a fight.
A fight that you started, because David thought that
I was having an affair.
With the president?
Which, of course,
I wasn't.
You know, either go get him, or we should head back to the car.
All right. I'll get him.
You wait here, and don't touch anything.
You punched the president?
Mein Gott!
Nearing point of contact,
Echo One.
We're closing in.
Echo One: Roger that.
You're a go to commence sequence when ready.
This I like.
Look at this.
You know what famous people have been here, hmm? Hmm?
Politicians, actors... baseball players, singers... and now me.
Imagine that. Look, a poor immigrant like me.
- It's a dream!
- Shh! Shh!
David, please!
TV: The three choppers are steadily approaching what has been unanimously agreed to be the front of these spaceships, a parabolic indentation
9 city blocks...
You're leaving now?
[Door Closes]
David, see if they got those pens that they give away.
Dad, what?
I don't have time for this.
- Two minutes, Tom.
- Connie--
Mr. President.
Julius Levinson.
David is my son.
I told you he wouldn't listen.
David, you have to tell him.
Connie.
David, tell him!
Uh, I know why we have satellite disruption.
All right. Go ahead.
OK.
Um...
Let's say that you want to coordinate with spaceships on different sides of the Earth.
You couldn't send a direct signal, right?
You're talking about line of sight.
Yeah, that's right.
Exactly.
The curve of the Earth prevents it.
You'd need satellites to relay that signal in order to reach each ship.
Well, I found a signal hidden inside our own satellite system.
[Door Opens]
Excuse me, Mr. President.
They're starting.
They're using our own satellites against us... and the clock is ticking.
Bringing it in to hover.
Welcome Wagon,
Echo One.
Approaching alien ship.
Initiating communications sequence, Echo One.
Welcome Wagon has commenced.
General Grey, coordinate with the Atlantic Command.
Tell them to evacuate as many people out of the cities as they can.
Yes, sir.
Get those helicopters away from the ship.
Call them back immediately.
What the hell's going on?
We're leaving.
Kim, my daughter.
Uh, there's something happening here.
They're responding.
Pilot:
Something's opening.
TV: Something is happening.
It looks like there's some kind of activity here.
This may be some type of response, Echo One.
Echo One: We see it, too.
Can't identify it.
We are evacuating.
I repeat.
We are evacuating the White House.
Load the rest of the staff in the second helicopter.
Man: Who should we pick?
Is my wife in the air?
General Grey:
She will be shortly.
Nice. Very nice.
OK. Buckle up.
Latch secure.
Look, we have our own phone.
Let's move outta here!
The president's ordered an evacuation.
We have to leave now.
TV: And our prayers go out to the wives and children of those brave pilots.
Indeed, God help us all.
George Putnam:
The visitors responded with terrifying...
Radio: Authorities have called for a complete evacuation of Los Angeles County.
People are advised to avoid the highways wherever possible.
Oh, yeah. Great.
Now he tells me.
Helicopter: This is the Los Angeles
Police Department.
Please vacate the premises immediately for your own safety.
Take me!
Take me!
Can we move it along?
[Honk Honk]
Woman: Dr. Katz's office.
Hello. Let me speak to Dr. Katz, please.
I'm sorry.
He's not available.
Listen, for $300 an hour, you can put me through to his house in the Hamptons!
This is the Los Angeles
Police Department.
Please vacate the premises immediately
Please vacate the premises immediately for your own safety.
Mrs. Whitmore.
You must leave now.
[Shouting]
First lady secured.
We're on the move.
Look!
They're opening up!
It's so pretty.
We gotta get the hell outta here!
Go ahead, pilot. We're ready to take off right now.
Can you get a blanket for Patricia?
Here.
Over there?
Time's up.
Get down!
Oh, crap.
[Siren Wailing Incessantly]
[Plane Shaking]
Oh, my God.
Come on, Dylan.
We gotta go.
Come on, Boomer.
Boomer!
Boomer!
Radio: Reports are unclear as to the extent of the devastation, but, from all accounts,
Los Angeles, Washington, and New York have been left in ruins...
Good God!
I been saying it.
I been saying it for 10 damn years.
Ain't I been saying it, Miguel?
Huh?
I been saying it.
Dad, I'm sick.
I don't feel good.
Pull it over, man.
[Vomiting]
We're going to be all right, Troy.
Leave me alone, man.
I got it.
Miguel.
Look at all that.
We could have evacuated the cities hours ago.
That's the advantage of being a fighter pilot.
In the Gulf War, we knew what we had to do.
It's just... not simple anymore.
A lot of people died today.
[Sigh]
How many didn't have to?
Any news on my wife yet?
The helicopter never made it to Nellis.
No radio contact.
Come on, Dylan.
Stay close.
Here it is.
What happened, Mommy?
I don't know, baby.
You men will be the first wave in our counterattack.
Our target is to the north centered above what remains of downtown Los Angeles...
You scared, man?
No.
You?
Nope.
We will fix on our target positions...
Hold me.
Hey, pay attention.
Something you want to add to this briefing,
Captain Hiller?
No, sir. I'm just a little anxious to get up there and whup E.T.'s ass, that's all.
And you'll get your chance.
You'll all get your chance.
Good hunting.
Dismissed.
Let's kick the tires and light the fires, big daddy.
Let's bring it home.
Let's bring that bad boy home, Captain.
You loose?
Yes, sir.
You got your victory dance?
Well, I got it right heeere.
Yeah!
Hey, hey. Don't get premature on me, soldier.
We don't light up till the fat lady sings.
I'm all ears, brother.
You the man!
All right, gentlemen, we're on.
General, it's NORAD.
General Grey here.
Al?
All satellite, microwave, and ground communications with the cities are down.
All systems go.
We believe we're looking at a total loss.
How about our boys?
Where are they?
ETA to target, four minutes.
I shouldn't have left her.
Don't worry about it, big man.
I'm sure she got out of here before it happened.
Or, as the good reverend would say,
[Imitating JesseJackson]
" Why we're on this particular mission we'll never know.
But I do know, here today, that the Black Knights will emerge victorious once again.''
Amen, man.
Amen, Reverend.
Holy God.
Lock and load.
Roger that.
Los Angeles
Attack Squadron has Amraam missiles locked on target.
Washington and New York squadrons reporting lock on.
Fire at will.
Fire at will.
Fire at will.
Command Center: Knights, we are red and free.

Are they not getting through?
No, sir. Not one.

Knight 7, Fox 2.
Come on. Come on.
They must have some kind of protective shield over their hull.
Knights!
Pull up! Pull up!
Knight 3, pull up!
Controls are showing complete failure of the stats.
Pull up!
Aah!
Blow through!
Blow through!
There's so many of them!
Aah!
They got another one, sir.
Oh, no. You did not shoot that green shit at me.
I've got you covered, big daddy.
Damn. They got shields, too.
Let's go, Knights.
Move, Knights, move!
Aah!
Jesus.
They got another one, sir.
Two more just went down.
They're dropping like flies.
We're losing them.
All right. Get them out of there.
Squadron leaders, retreat to fallback positions.
Abort mission right away.
Do you read me?
Do you copy?
We're going to have to make a run for this one here.
Let's get low.
Let's get fast.
I got you, big daddy.
Let's get them.
Whoo!
Watch the deck.
Squadron Leader, do you read?
This isn't happening fast enough.
Get them out of there!
What's with the monitor?
Where's the picture?
We've lost the satellite.
Steven: We got two R-6,
Jimmy. Check them.
Roger.
Come on, come on.
Move, move, move!
He's on me like white on rice, big daddy.
They ain't got nothing for us.
Let's push it.
We've got to go.
I can't shake him.
I can't shake him.
Yes, you can.
Just the way I showed you.
Check me out. I'm going to try something.
Don't do nothing stupid over there.
You know me.
That's what
I'm talking about.
Jimmy, what are you doing?
You can't bank at that speed.
Jimmy, he's closing on you!
Put your mask back on!
That's an order!
I can't breathe!
Jimmy!
Jimmy!
Jimmy! No!
That's affirmative.
We have incoming.
Let me have it, son.
You got it.
Friendly?
Sergeant?
I don't think so.
[Alarm Sounds]
Go! Go! Go! Go!
Come on and get me!
Come and get me!
Oh, what are you shooting at?
Where you at, baby?
Come on! Come on!
Aw, you can't hit nothing!
Aah!
Ha! Ha!
Whoa! Low bridge!
See if you can fly that thing undercover.
Ha ha. Hope you got an air bag.
Whoa!
Aah! Unh!
[Gasping]
Aah! Unh!
Son of a bitch.
Aah!
That's right!
That's right!
Get off of me!
Get off of me!
That's what you get!
Ha ha!
Look at you!
Ship all banged up!
Who's the man?
Huh? Who's the man?
Wait until I get another plane!
I'm lining all your friends up right beside you!
Where you at, huh?
Huh? Where you at?
Welcome to Earth.
Now, that's what I call a close encounter.
Baby, stay right here.
Stay right here with Boomer.
Keys.
Come on. Keys.
Yes!
Come on, baby.
Come on.
Come on.
Yes!
Radio: Reports indicate that this battle has repeated itself all over the world with the exact same results.
You're just like your mother, you know that?
She was stubborn, too.
Had to twist her arm to get her to take her medicine.
You're gonna be all right.
You're gonna be fine.
See, Troy? You're feeling better already.
I couldn't find anything.
Everyone's packing up.
They're leaving.
They said there's a spaceship heading this way.
We'd better leave, too, then.
[Knocking]
Penicillin.
At least it'll help keep his fever down.
Oh, thank you.
It's really nice of you to help us.
I wish I could do more, but we're moving out.
I-I'm going with you.
Um...Well, I--I just--
I mean, that--that we're going, too.
Cool.
Tell that punk to shut the door. We're outta here.
Go sniff around somewhere else.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Uhh...
It's Air Force One, for crying out loud.
Still he gets sick.
Oh, boy.
I don't feel so good.
Look at me, huh?
Like a rock.
Could be bad weather, could be good weather.
It doesn't matter.
We could go up.
We could go down.
We can go back.
We can go forward.
We can go side to side--
What'd I say?
He still gets airsick, huh?
Yeah.
Julius, with all of this, I, uh...
I didn't get a chance to thank you two.
All he could think of was getting to you.
There's still love there,
I think.
Love was never our problem.
" All you need is love."
John Lennon.
Smart man.
Shot in the back.
Very sad.
We've moved as many of our forces away from our bases as possible, but we've already sustained heavy losses.
I spoke with the joint chiefs when they arrived at NORAD.
They agree we must launch a counteroffensive with a full nuclear strike.
Over American soil?
You're saying, at this point, we should sacrifice more innocent
American civilians?
Is that right?
Sir, if we don't strike soon there may not be much of an America left to defend.
Sir, they've taken out NORAD.
What?
It's gone, sir.
My God.
The vice president, joint chiefs.
Mr. President, we must launch.
A delay now would be more costly than when you waited to evacuate the cities.
No, no. You're not going to launch nuclear weapons.
You're going to kill them and us at the same time.
If we fire nukes, then everybody else is going to fire them.
You are a guest here.
Ever hear of nuclear winter?
It's the end of life as we know it.
Do you hear what they're talking about?
Don't even think about it.
I don't have to go.
It can't be allowed.
Shut up! Captain, get him out of here!
Hey, don't tell him to shut up!
You'd all be dead now if it wasn't for my David.
None of you did anything to prevent this.
There was nothing we could do.
We were totally unprepared for this.
Aw! Don't give me unprepared.
Come on,Julius.
It was in the 1950s.
You had that spaceship.
David: Dad.
Julius: Yeah, that thing that you found in New Mexico.
Dad, no.
Not the spaceship.
Roswell.
Roswell, New Mexico. Yeah.
You had the spaceship, and you had the bodies.
They were all locked up in a bunker.
Where was that?
David?
In Area 51, right?
Area 51.
You knew then, and you did nothing.
Sir, regardless of what you may have read in the tabloids, there have never been any spacecraft recovered by our government.
Take my word for it, there's no Area 51.
There's no recovered spaceship.
Uh, excuse me,
Mr. President?
That's not entirely accurate.
What? Which part?
Hold on, everybody!
Hold on!
Sorry.
The end hath come!
He spaketh His word, and the end hath come!
Hop on!
We're heading out to El Toro.
You cannot defy what hath come.
It is the end!
[Sobbing]
El Toro?!
Jasmine: Can you give me a hand?
Yeah, sure.
Oh, my God.
[Boomer Barks]
OK, OK. Let's--
Let's get this off.
Here. Let me help you.
She's hurt pretty badly.
You know, this was supposed to be my weekend off.
But no.
You got me out here dragging your heavy ass through the burning desert, with your dreadlocks sticking out the back of my parachute.
You've got to come down here with an attitude, acting all big and bad.
And what the hell is that smell?!
Aah!
I could've been at a barbecue!
But I ain't mad.
It's all right.
That is all right.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
You need a lift, soldier?
When I flew overhead,
I saw a base not too far from here.
It ain't on the map.
Trust me. It's there.
Ten-hut!
Mr. President.
General.
Welcome to Area 51.
Please follow me.
We're now 2 4 floors beneath the surface, and here's our main research facility.
Let's see it.
I'm sorry, sir.
It's a clean room.
We have to keep it static-free.
If we'll all go to decontamination--
Open the door.
Yes, sir.
My God. Why the hell wasn't
I told about this place?
Two words,
Mr. President: plausible deniability.
I don't understand.
Where does all this come from?
How do you get funding for something like this?
You don't actually think they spend $20,000 on a hammer,
$30,000 on a toilet seat, do you?
Mr. President, this is Dr. Okun.
He's been heading up the research department on this project for the last 15 years.
How do you do.
Mr. President.
Wow.
This--
What a pleasure.
As you can imagine, they don't let us out much.
I can understand that.
Well, I guess you'd like to see the big tamale, huh?
Follow me.
[Assistant
Enters Code]
She's a beaut, ain't she?
Dr. Okun: As you can see from the repairs, we've been trying to put her back together since the late 1960s.
Don't tell me you've had this for 40 years, and you don't know anything about them?
Oh, hell, no. No, no.
We know tons about them.
But the neatest stuff-- the neatest stuff has only happened in the last few days.
See, we can't duplicate their type of power, so we've never been able to experiment.
But since these guys started showing up, all the little gizmos inside turned on.
The last 2 4 hours have been really exciting.
Exciting?
People are dying out there.
I don't think " exciting" is the word I'd choose to describe it.
You guys are hoping to fly this thing, huh?
You said you can repair their technology.
Can you tell us anything useful about them?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Well, I mean, they're not all that dissimilar from us.
Breathes oxygen.
Comparable tolerances to heat, cold.
Probably why they're interested in our planet.
Hey.
Hey.
You guys want to see them?
Hmm?
This is--
This is the vault, or as some of us have come to call it,
" The Freak Show."
Ha ha ha ha ha.
" The--"
When we found them, they were wearing some sort of biomechanical suits, but once we got them off, we learned a great deal about their anatomy.
Eyes, ears, no vocal chords.
We're assuming they communicate with each other through some other means.
You're obviously not thinking about hand signals and body language.
It's some kind of extrasensory perception.
Telepathy.
So...
It's an organic life form.
Can they be killed?
Their bodies are just as frail as ours.
These two died in the crash.
This one, a few weeks later.
You just--
You have to get through their technology, which is,
I'm sorry to say, far more advanced.
David, you unlocked part of that technology.
You cracked the code.
Oh, no, no.
All I did was stumble onto their signal.
I don't know how helpful I can be.
Why don't you show them what you've discovered so far, figure out what they haven't thought of yet, and we'll see if you're as smart as we all hope you are.
What code?
Captain Steven Hiller,
United States
Marine Corps.
I'm sorry, Captain.
This is a restricted area.
I can't let you pass without clearance.
OK. Come here.
You want to see my clearance?
Maybe I'll just leave this here with you.
Let them pass.
Let them pass.
Get the hell out of the way.
Did you see that?
Come on down.
Come on down.
Watch your step.
Well, obviously, this cockpit was designed to seat three, though how they sat on that,
I don't know.
David: Gently.
Uh, you see these gizmos flashing?
Yeah.
We've been working around the clock trying to get a fix on all this crap.
Some stuff we figured out right away.
Uh, this, we're pretty sure, is the life support system for the cabin.
[Coughs] And, uh, this doohickey is connected to--
Oh...Well, it was connected to the engine.
Here.
Take that, will ya?
Uh, these configurations, uh...
Well, to be honest, we--we--we don't know what the hell this crap is.
But this is clearly what they use to guide and navigate their craft.
Ha ha. Neat, huh?
That's very good.
Somebody grab my laptop there?
Dr. Isaacs, can I just have the computer inside there?
See these patterns here?
They're repeating sequentially, just like their countdown signal.
They're using that frequency for computer communications.
Huh?
See? That's how they're coordinating their ships.
Huh. Ya know... you're really starting to make us look bad.
They got one!
They got one alive!
They got one. Alive.
Jesus! Look, will you be OK by yourself, Dave?
Fine, Dr. Okun.
Yeah--Uh, don't touch anything.
Why is he always telling me not to touch anything?
Yeah. There.
Oh...that's why.
Right here. We got her in the back of the pickup.
How you doin', sir.
Captain Steven Hiller,
United States Marine Corps.
Guess who's comin' to dinner.
I need a doctor!
I need a doctor!
Oh, boy.
Oh, boy.
How long has it been unconscious?
About three hours.
Let's get him into containment, stat.
My son, he's very sick.
He needs immediate attention.
He's drying out.
I want him sprayed down with saline.
He has a problem with his adrenal cortex.
Please!
If you don't do something about it right now, my son will die!
OK!Just help him!
OK. O'Haver, Miller, you come with us.
You take us to him,
OK?
Let's go.
OK. Move it!
Move it! Move it!
As the former head of the C.I.A., you knew about this place.
When were you planning on informing the rest of us?
It had been deemed classified.
You should have told us about this when they first arrived.
You should have warned us before we launched a counterattack that cost us the lives of hundreds of American pilots!
There was no way we could have known that our fighters would have been that ineffective against their attackers.
Mr. President.
Commander #2: The little bit of information that we have comes directly into this room, Mr. President.
Atlanta, Chicago, and Philadelphia... destroyed.
We've learned that NATO and Western Allied
Installations were the first to be taken out.
Then we were hit.
They knew exactly where and how to hit us.
Whitmore:
And our forces?
General Grey:
We're down to 15%.
If you calculate the time it takes to destroy a city and move on, we're looking at the worldwide destruction of every major city... in the next 36 hours.
We're being exterminated.
Mitchell:
Mr. President.
This is
Captain Steven Hiller.
Captain.
Mr. President.
Well done.
Where is it now?
We have it isolated down in the containment lab, sir.
I'd like to go see it.
General, I'm really anxious to get back to El Toro.
Hasn't anyone told you?
El Toro has been completely destroyed.
Oh, no.
We were lucky.
[Chuckles]
Today was the first time
I used the subway.
Thank God for the metro rail.
These should last us a while.
Don't move.
I'll get it for you.
Stay still.
He's your son?
He's my angel.
Was his father stationed here?
Nah, he, uh... he wasn't his father.
But I was kind of hoping he wanted the job, though.
So what do you do for a living?
I'm a dancer.
Ah.
Ballet?
No.
Exotic.
Oh.
Sorry.
Don't be.
I'm not.
It's good money.
Besides, my baby's worth it.
Dylan.
Come here.
I want you to meet the first lady.
Ohh.
Hello.
Hi.
I didn't know that you'd recognized me.
Well, I didn't want to say nothing.
I voted for the other guy.
All right, life support monitors recording.
So if we screw up, it's all on tape.
OK, come on, come on.
Let's get this biomechanical suit off him.
Put the spreader right here.
Right along the ridge.
Microprobe thingamajig goes right here, pick there. Good.
All right, now spread it very, very gently.
Let me get in.
Uh-huh.
Gentle, gentle.
That's it.
That's right...easy.
[Nervous Laughter]
All right. OK.
Let's proceed.
Now comes the, uh, the really icky part.
Ugh.
Oh, boy.
This is one smelly, disgusting...
Oh, look at it.
It doesn't look alive, does it?
Med Assistant:
The arm is moving.
[High-pitched Whirring]
Aah!
Doctor!
Aah!
Aah!
Doctor! Doctor!
[Shouting]
Get it off!
Don't move!
Don't move!
Help me! Help me!
Aah!
[Alarm Sounds]
Aah!
Open up that door!
My God!
Dr. Okun.
[Strangled Voice]
Release...me.
Open the door.
Get him out of there.
No, wait.
Release me.
Now!
I know there is much we can learn from each other if we can negotiate a truce.
We can find a way to coexist.
Can there be a peace between us?
Peace?
No peace.
What is it you want us to do?
Die.
Die...
Uh! Uh!
Uh! Aah!
Mr. President...
Is that glass bulletproof?
No, sir.
Ah!
General Grey:
Are you all right?
I saw his thoughts.
I saw what they're planning to do.
They're like locusts.
They're moving from planet to planet, their whole civilization.
After they've consumed every natural resource, they move on.
And we're next.
[Alien Shrieking]
Nuke 'em.
Let's nuke the bastards.
Just my luck.
No ice.
I take it you've heard.
Hey, a toast.
To the end of the world.
He didn't come to this decision lightly.
He didn't have any other choice.
Yeah.
You still believe in him.
Yeah. Well, he's a good man.
Whoa...ha ha.
He better be.
You left me for him.
Or, you know, for your...career.
You know, it wasn't just my...career.
It was the biggest opportunity of my life.
I wanted my life to make a difference.
I wanted my life to mean something.
Yeah, and, um, hmm,
I wasn't, um... ambitious enough for you?
David, you could have done anything that you wanted.
Research, development--
Oh, honey, I was happy where I was.
Haven't you ever wanted to be part of something special?
I was part of something special.
Well, if it makes any difference,
I never stopped loving you.
But that wasn't enough, was it?
Soldier: Let's pick it up, men.
We're on a tight schedule, now. Let's go.
Let's pick it up, men.
We're working on a tight schedule. Let's go!
Pick it up, man!
Pick it up!
What the hell are you doing?
Get out of there!
Look, I got something
I got to handle.
I'm just borrowing it.
No, you're not, sir.
Do you really want to shoot me?
Just tell them
I hit you.
Command, this is Retel Op.
The squadron is in the air.
We are on station and awaiting instructions.
Roger. Break formation, head to targets.
Sir... they're breaking formation.
Mr. President, we're initiating sequence code.
Commander #2:
Verification,
Alpha Zulu 6-8-9er.
Which city will be reached first?
Houston, Texas.
ETA six minutes and counting down.
Houston.
The major cities have been deserted.
Civilian casualties should be down to a minimum.
Tank Commander: Command, this is Neighborhood Watch.
We are in position.
Tracking monitors are locked on.
We are going to visual recon.
Tank Commander #2
On Radio: Roger that, TCW.
They have confirmation.
Launch code confirmed.
Alpha Zulu 6-8-9er.
Standing by.
Laser targeting.
Locked on.
We're locked on, sir.
Do you wish to deploy?
Mr. President, if you wish to deploy, the time is now.
Mr. President.
Deploy.
That's a go.
Alpha Zulu 6-8-9er, that is a go.
Here we go.
Bird's away.
We have visual confirmation of the missile.
It's on target... approaching...
May our children forgive us.
5 seconds to impact.
Oh, yeah, it's a hit!
[Sighs]
Lock it down!
I said lock it down!
Can I confirm that the target was destroyed?
Get the tank commander on the line.
I want confirmation that the target was destroyed.
Yes, sir. Red Arrow
Alpha 9er 7-2-3, can you read?
[Static]
Repeat, Commander, you're breaking up.
We have lost visual.
Roger that.
We're looking for confirmation.
We got the bastards.
Yeah! Good job, everyone.
Congratulations.
[Applause And Cheering]
Commander, do you have visual?
I repeat, we need visual confirmation.
Has the target been destroyed?
Negative.
Target remains.
I repeat... target remains.
Call the other planes back.
One of the bombers might have more luck.
Sir, we shouldn't just give up on this!
I said call them back.
Abort.
All right, abort mission.
Issue the abort codes right away.
This is an abort.
Full abort.
Do you read?
Abort mission right away.
[Helicopter Whirs]
Jasmine?
Yes. Yes!
You're late.
Well, you know I like to make an entrance.
Right this way.
Where are we going?
Right through there, sir.
Mr. President, your wife is resting comfortably at the moment.
Great.
Perhaps if we had gotten to her earlier--
Hey, there she is.
Go on.
She doesn't look too good.
Your wife is bleeding internally,
Mr. President.
Perhaps if we'd gotten to her earlier--
Wait a minute.
What are you saying?
We can't stop the bleeding.
If we'd...
There's nothing we can do for her.
Patricia: We were worried.
We didn't know where you were.
I didn't know where I was either.
You got bigger,
I think.
I did?
Mm-hmm.
Just keep growing and growing.
I can't...
Hey.
Can you, uh, wait outside for a little bit so Mom can get a rest?
Hey.
Come on, munchkin.
[Moans]
I'm so sorry that I didn't come home when you asked me to.
Ohh...
Ohh...
It's OK.
The doctors... think that you're... gonna be just fine.
Liar.
[Speaking Softly]
Is Mommy sleeping now?
Yeah...
Mommy's sleeping.
Hey.
[Crash]
David!
What the hell are you doing?
I'm making a mess!
Yeah, this I can see.
We gotta burn the rain forest, dump toxic waste, pollute the air, and rip up the ozone,
'cause maybe if we screw this planet up enough... they won't want it anymore.
Wait, wait, wait.
David, David!
Don't do this to yourself.
Listen to me.
Are you listening to me?
Everyone loses faith at some point in their life.
David, look at myself.
I haven't spoken to God since your mother died.
Yes.
But see, sometimes, we have to remember what we still have.
Like what?
Well... you still have your health.
Come on, David, David.
You need your rest.
Come on. Get off this freezing concrete floor before you catch cold.
Come on.
What did you just say?
You mean about faith?
Well, you see, a man can live his entire life--
After that.
The other part.
What? What?
I don't want you to catch cold.
Duh!
What is that?
What's the matter with you?
Genius.
Genius?
My dad--a total genius.
Jim, wake up.
We got work to do.
Get everybody down here right away.
What?
Look at that.
Wow! Does that thing really fly in outer space?
It most certainly does.
Sure doesn't look like it.
Hey, they're here.
All right, Connie, what's this all about?
I have no idea.
Get everybody off of it.
All right, everybody, clear the platform.
Let's go.
Come on, come on.
Major Mitchell, do you have a pistol?
- What?
- You got a gun?
Sergeant, your sidearm.
See that, uh, Coke can on top of the alien craft?
Think you can shoot that thing off?
Do it. Shoot it.
Sir?
Go ahead.
[Cocks Gun]
[Bullet Ricocheting]
Steven: What the hell are you doing?
I'm sorry. My fault.
My fault.
That Coke can was protected by the craft's shield, and we can't penetrate their defenses.
We know that already.
What's your point?
Right. My point is, if we can't beat their defenses, then we gotta get around them.
Major, one more time.
Anytime.
[Takes Deep Breath]
How did you do that?
I gave it a cold.
I gave it a virus.
A computer virus.
Are you telling us you can send out a signal that will disable all their shields?
That's right.
Just like they used our satellites against us, we can use their own signal against them.
If we plant a virus into that mother ship, it's gonna then filter down into all the corresponding ships below.
I--I'm sorry.
I don't understand.
Just how, exactly, do we infect the mother ship with this virus?
Well... we're going to, uh... have to, um, ahem, fly their alien craft out of our atmosphere and dock with it.
We can enter here, as shown in these satellite photos.
We then upload the virus.
We then set off some kind of explosion, which will disable it, and that'll disorient the smaller ships below, and that could buy,
I think, at least some time to, uh... to take 'em-- take 'em out.
Take 'em down.
Do your... do your stuff.
This is ridiculous.
How long would their shields be down?
Uh...
I don't know.
A matter of minutes.
You want us to coordinate a massive worldwide counterstrike with a window of only a few minutes?
With the shields down, that might be possible.
Oh, please.
We don't have the manpower or the resources to launch that kind of a campaign.
Not to mention that this whole cockamamie plan is dependent on a machine that no one in this world is qualified to operate.
I wouldn't say that, sir.
I've seen these things in action, and I'm well aware of their maneuvering capabilities.
With your permission,
General,
I'd like the opportunity to try.
That thing is a wreck.
Crash-landed back in the fifties.
We don't even know if it's capable of flying.
Jim, uh, remove the clamps.
[Clicking]
Any questions?
Let's do it.
Mitchell: You heard the president.
Let's get this thing prepped and ready.
Good luck, pilot.
Thank you, Mr. President.
A virus.
Your idea.
That's right.
You really think you can fly that thing?
You really think you can do all that bullshit you just said?
Hoo.
I understand you are upset over the death of your wife, but that's no excuse for making another fatal mistake.
The only mistake
I ever made was to appoint a sniveling little weasel like you as secretary of defense.
I don't think you understand--
However, that is one mistake
I'm thankful to say that I don't have to live with.
Mr. President--
Mr. Nimziki...you're fired.
Let's organize every plane we can find and get us some goddamn pilots to fly 'em.
Yes, sir.
He can't do that.
Well, he just, uh... did.
Command has attempted to compile a list of casualties and losses, but information is sketchy at best.
Well, we know we've lost the Belgian contingent in the Sinai.
There's a strong possibility there may be more reinforcements hiding in the Golan Strait.
[Speaking Arabic]
What the hell's he saying?
It seems they're getting a signal.
Old Morse code.
[Speaking Arabic]
[Morse Code On Radio]
It's from the Americans.
They want to organize a counteroffensive.
It's about bloody time.
What do they plan to do?
[Speaking Russian]
[Speaking Japanese]
We have confirmed reports of combat-ready divisions in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia.
That's impressive, considering it's all being done with, uh...
Morse code.
Are our forces here?
We have sufficient aircraft for the battle plan, but...
But what, General?
Pilots are coming up short.
Well, then find 'em.
TV: Ham radio operators from New York toJapan trade rumors of military forces in hiding, unwilling to reveal themselves for fear of annihilation...
P.A.: What we're planning at this time is to launch a counteroffensive.
However, with our depleted manpower, we're asking that anyone with any flight experience come forward.
Military training is preferable, but anyone who can fly a plane would be useful.
I can fly.
I'm a pilot.
All right, guys, listen up.
Mitchell: All right, pay close attention.
These F-18s are very different than the jets you've piloted before.
It's kind of strong.
You'll have to forgive the expression, but you're about to get a crash course in modern avionics.
Ugh! Keep it coming.
Keep it coming.
OK. You got it.
All right, listen up.
Before we can begin, we're going to have to get a little background information on your flight experience.
Uh, let's start with you.
Who, me?
Uh...
Well, I'm, uh, ahem,
Russell Casse, sir.
Um...and, uh, after 'Nam, I, uh, got into crop-dusting.
And, uh, been doing that ever since.
Oh, and on a, uh, personal note, sir,
I'd just like to add that, uh... ever since I was kidnapped by aliens
10 years ago,
I've been dying for some payback, and I just want you to know that, uh,
I won't let you down.
You have one tactical nuclear missile we're loading into this launcher we're installing under the right wing.
This is the firing mechanism, to be attached to the ship's main console.
Just like the Amraam launch pad on the Stealth.
Except the nuke will not detonate at impact.
You'll have 30 seconds to get your asses out of there.
Good luck, gentlemen.
30 seconds.
Tell me. Tell me.
It was the strongest radio transmitter we could get.
It'll tell us when you've uploaded the virus.
30 seconds. Don't you think that's cutting it a little too close?
Oh, we're gonna be well on our way back home before we shoot that thing off.
Why you?
David!
I don't--Excuse me.
I don't understand why you can't show someone else how to plant the virus, someone who is trained--
No, no.
Something may go wrong.
I may have to think quickly, adjust the signal.
Who knows?
Hey, you know how, like, I'm always trying to save the planet?
Here's my chance.
Now he gets ambitious.
It's too tight.
It's too tight.
Well,
I had to borrow it.
Let me see. OK. I guess that's good enough.
So, how do I look?
Oh, thank you.
You're a lot of help.
You're late.
Well, you know me.
I know. You like to make a big entrance.
Let me help you.
Um, listen... before we do this,
I just want to say
I'm sorry.
Sorry for what, babe?
I should have done this a long time ago.
Do you have the ring?
Uh, yes, sir.
Here. Make yourself useful.
[Pat Pat]
Ow.
Witnesses?
- Uh...
- Um...
Sorry.
We got hung up.
Well, let's get this show on the road.
Dearly beloved, we're gathered here in the sight of God and in the presence of these witnesses to join this man and this woman in holy matrimony.
Any person who can show good cause why these two should not wed, please speak now, or forever hold your peace.
Steve, will you take this woman to be your wedded wife, to live together with her in the holy state of matrimony?
Will you love her, comfort her, honor and keep her in sickness and in health?
And, forsaking all others, keep yourself only for her as long as you both shall live?
I will.
Whew.
Good morning.
They're a little young.
That they are.
They look a little nervous.
I'm gonna need all flight crews to report to their designated areas immediately.
Major, can I borrow that?
Sir.
Good morning.
[Feedback]
Good morning.
In less than an hour, aircraft from here will join others from around the world, and you will be launching the largest aerial battle in the history of mankind.
Mankind. That word should have new meaning for all of us today.
We can't be consumed by our petty differences anymore.
We will be united in our common interests.
Perhaps it's fate that today is the 4th ofJuly, and you will once again be fighting for our freedom... not from tyranny, oppression, or persecution... but from annihilation.
We are fighting for our right to live.
To exist.
And should we win the day... the Fourth ofJuly will no longer be known as an American holiday... but as the day when the world declared in one voice, we will not go quietly into the night!
We will not vanish without a fight!
We're going to live on!
We're going to survive!
Today we celebrate our independence day!
[Cheering]
Let's go!
Mr. President, right this way, sir.
We got your gear over here.
I got a jumpsuit for you, and the rest of your gear's squared away in this duffel.
You got your choice of helmets.
Mr. President,
I'd sure like to know what you're doing.
I'm a combat pilot,
Will.
I belong in the air.
OK, sir.
Let's get you airborne.
Right over here.
You know, as soon as I get back, we're gonna light those fireworks, right?
Julius: Here.
Take these.
Just in case.
Where's--Where's, um...
Just in case.
I'm very proud of you.
So be careful, OK?
It's time.
I love you.
I love you.
Oh, damn!
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute. Wait.
We got to find some cigars.
Here! Here!
Take these.
My last two.
You are a lifesaver.
Almost put a hex on the whole damn thing.
Computer: Missile launched.
Oh, crap!
What--What did I hit?
I picked a hell of a day to quit drinking.
This is our victory dance.
Not until the fat lady sings.
Oh! Yes. OK.
This is important.
Mm. Fat lady.
I gotcha.
Open launch tunnel.
Shaky, huh?
Is it gonna do this the whole way?
Is it gonna do this the whole way?
Just make sure your seat backs and tray tables are in their upright and locked position.
Yeah--Is it?
Let's rock 'n' roll.
Oh!
Aah!
[Steven Chuckles]
Oops.
Oops? What does that mean?
What do you mean--
Nah. I--I got it.
Some jerk didn't put the...
I know what I mean when I say it.
What do you mean saying " oops" there?
What do you say we try that one again, huh?
Yes, yes.
Yes, without the " oops."
There's the...thataway.
- Oof!
- Ooh...
- Whaa...Hoo!
- Aah...Oh!
I have got to get me one of these!
No--No. What was that?
Don't do that.
Just trying to get a feel for the old girl, that's all.
Oh, no--no, don't.
Leave her alone.
Look! No hands.
Steve!
Ha ha ha ha!
You're all secured, sir.
Grey, do you read me?
Roger, Eagle One.
Your primary target has shifted course.
Which way are they headed?
I think our secret's out.
They're headed straight for us.
ETA 26 minutes.
[Groaning]
Still with me over there?
What the hell was I thinking?
[Groaning]
I've been waiting for this my whole life.
Head straight for it.
[Whoosh]
What the hell...
Don't touch them!
No, no, don't!
I was counting on this.
They are bringing us in.
When the hell was you gonna tell me?
Oops.
We're going to have to work on our communication.
We have visual.
Do not engage until we've confirmed the package has been delivered.
Roger.
Major, what happens if--if that thing gets here... before the virus is planted?
Well, ma'am, this facility's buried deep within the mountain.
It should provide us some protection.
Great. What about the people outside?
Lieutenant Sayle, we got incoming.
Oh, my God.
Look at that.
There must be thousands of them, millions of them.
What the hell are they doing?
Looks like they're preparing an invasion.
Hey, I don't like this.
This is stupid.
They can see us!
Oh, no, no, no.
This thing comes fully loaded.
AM-FM radio, reclining bucket seats, and... power windows.
Come on, baby.
Come on, baby.
[Sigh Of Relief]
We're in.
Oh.
[David Muttering]
Oh, do it. Do it.
Do it.
Sir, he's uploading the virus.
Sir, he's uploading the virus.
Eagle One, the package is being delivered.
Stand by to engage.
Roger. Eagle One.
Check left.
Hey, listen up.
We have an emergency situation.
We need everyone to grab everything they can.
Only what you can carry.
We need to get you inside immediately.
The virus is in.
All we can do now is...pray.
Delivery complete.
Engage.
Delivery complete.
It's a go. It's a go.
Eagle One. Fox Three.
Gentlemen, this is it.
Come on. Come on.
Come on.
God.
Virus ineffective.
Disengage.
Get your people out of there.
Commander: Disengage.
Rear flank, follow suit.
Whitmore: Hold on,
Command.
I want another shot at it.
Sir, I strongly recommend you disengage.
Eagle One.
Fox Three.
Direct hit!
Commander: Squadron leaders, fire at will! Fire at will!
Fire at will!
We're going in.
Squadron leaders, take point.
Eagle Six at seven.
Eagle Five at three.
Eagle One...
Fox Two!
Eagle 20. Fox Two!
Evasive maneuvers!
Squadron leaders, evasive maneuvers!
Prepare to engage!
Casse: All right,
Mr. President, here we go!
All right, baby,
I've got you.
Casse: Payback's a bitch, ain't it?
OK,job's done.
Let's go home.
Gladly.
What's up?
We're stuck.
What?
It's not responding.
It's stuck.
Then try again.
Come on! Come on!
Steve! Steve!
Hey, what the hell are you doing?
It's not me.
They're overriding the system.
Oh...shit!
Um... hide.
Everybody hold someone's hand.
Hold hands!
Come on in.
[Praying In Hebrew]
I'm notJewish.
Nobody's perfect.
[Praying]
God!
Where are they?
[Explosions Outside]
This could be our last night on Earth.
I--I don't want to die a virgin.
If we do... we'll both die virgins.
But at least we'll be together.
[Big Explosion]
Are you scared?
Me, too.
Eagle Seven. Fox Two.
Eagle Three. Fox Two.
We're running out of missiles, sir.
We're just not causing enough damage.
It's settling directly over us.
They're preparing to fire their primary weapon!
Then let's take it out before it takes us out.
Target at 12 o'clock.
My God, they're everywhere.
Bandits on our tail!
They're locked on!
I see 'em!
All right, squadron leaders,
I want weapons check.
[Giving Instructions]
You're outta time!
You've gotta disable it now!
I'm in range.
Locking on.
I've got tone.
Eagle One. Fox Two!
That is a negative impact.
That is an N.I.
Negative impact.
I'm out of missiles.
Eagle Two!
I'm on it.
Oh! Oh!Jesus!
Sir, all missiles have been fired.
You're out of time!
Get your ass out of there!
We're not done yet!
Get as far away as you can!
Doesn't anyone have any missiles left?
Russell: Sorry I'm late,
Mr. President!
Kinda got hung up back there.
Pilot, you armed?
Armed and ready, sir.
I'm packin'.
Who is that guy?
Put him on speaker.
Pilot, identify yourself.
It's me. Russell Casse, sir.
I told you I wouldn't let you down.
Just keep those guys off me for a few more seconds, will ya?
Commander: OK.
Echo-9er, Echo-7.
Take flanking positions.
I want you to look after this guy.
All right, boys, let's give Mr. Casse some cover.
Gentlemen... let's plow the road!
We'll draw 'em off, and it'll be all yours!
Russell: Whoa-hoo!
Look out! Comin' through!
I've got tone.
[Beeping]
Eagle 20. Fox Two.
Eagle 20. Fox Two.
It's jammed!
It won't fire.
Damn it!
Do me a favor.
Tell my children...
I love them very much.
All right, you alien assholes!
In the words of my generation... up yours!
Dad!
What's he doing?
Russell: Come on, baby!
Come on, baby! Come on!
Good luck, buddy.
[Russell Laughs]
Hello, boys!
I'm back!
He did it!
The son of a bitch did it!
All right!
What your father did was very brave.
You should be proud of him.
I am.
Now we know how to take them out, General.
Spread the word.
Get on the wire to every squadron around the world.
Tell 'em how to bring those sons of bitches down.
What do you think?
Checkmate.
Wow, it's funny.
I always thought that things like these would kill me.
[Opens Lighter]
Thank you.
It's been a pleasure.
Steve, you, too.
There's only one thing left to do.
There's only one thing left to do.
Ready?
Yes, sir.
Hey! All right!
Hey, hey!
Look at us!
Take a look at the Earthlings.
Good-bye!
Y'all take care, all right?
Nothin' but love for ya.
Do you think they have any clue what's about to happen to 'em?
Oh, not a chance in hell.
Good night.
[Static]
[Laughing]
Peace!
Ohh!
We're loose.
Can you get us out of here in 30 seconds?
I ain't heard no fat lady!
Forget the fat lady.
You're obsessed with the fat lady.
Drive us outta here.
Ohh! They're chasing us.
Oh, really? You think?
Oh, that was a hit.
I took a hit.
We're not hit!
We're not hit!
Stop side-seat driving.
Left, left.
Tunnel, tunnel.
Exit, exit. Left!
Where the hell do you think I'm going?
Ok, we-we-we're, uh...
Uh-oh, they're closing up on us.
Is that closing?
Shut up! Shut up!
Shut up!
Must go faster.
Must go faster.
- Go, go, go, go!
- Aaaaahh!
Aaaaahh!
Aah!
Elvis has left the building!
[Imitating Elvis]
Thank you very much.
Ohh!
I love you, man.
[Cheering]
[Cheering]
[Cheering And Applause]
They're going down all over the world, Tom.
We got 'em beat.
How about our two delivery boys?
Any word from them?
We lost contact with Captain Hiller and Levinson nearly 20 minutes ago.
Commander #1:
Hold it!
Hold on, sir.
I've got something on radar.
Sorry, sir.
Good job.
Thank you.
Well done, Captain.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.
David... not bad.
Thank you,
Mr. President.
Not too bad at all.
Oh, so this is healthy?
Oh, I could get used to it.
Happy 4th ofJuly,
Daddy.
Same to you, munchkin.
Didn't I promise you fireworks?
Yeah.
Wu.
You and your brothers murdered three of our men.
He would have done the same.
Send three more and I'll kill them, too.
He already controls the opium trade all across Asia.
May no one prosper but Ying Ko?
My poppy fields are tiny.
Nothing compared to his.
I, Li Peng, at least I'm entitled to my little piece.
Ying Ko, if you kill me, I promise... my brothers will come for you.
And I promise you...
I'll bury them beside you.
Kill him.
Let me go. I only wish to leave.
I'll cut his throat.
Your men are not marksmen enough to shoot around him.
You're right.
You're right.
Wu, you are a wonderful friend.
- Like a father to me.
- Thank you, Ying Ko.
Shoot through him.
Where are you taking me?
A Tulku wishes to see you at his temple.
A holy man wants to see me?
- You call that a temple?
- No.
There.
Where did that come from?
The clouded mind sees nothing.
- Who are you?
- I am your teacher.
Do you have any idea who you just kidnapped?
Cranston.
Lamont Cranston.
You know my real name?
Yes.
I also know that for as long as you can remember... you struggled against your own black heart and always lost.
You watched your spirit, your very face, change... as the beast claws its way out from within you.
You are in great pain, aren't you?
You know what evil lurks in the hearts of men... for you have seen that evil in your heart.
Every man pays the price for redemption.
This is yours.
- I'm not looking for redemption.
- You have no choice.
You will be redeemed... because I will teach you to use your black shadow to fight evil.
I wouldn't do that.
Phurba!
Am I in hell?
Not yet.
Get him, Johnny.
Maxie.
- Let's get this over with.
- Get out.
- No!
- Come on!
- Please, I didn't see anything.
- Quit your whining.
- Is it dry?
- Please.
- Perfect, Duke.
- Bring him to the rail.
I won't tell anyone. I swear.
Geez.
I wish I could trust you, sport.
I really do.
I guess you just picked the wrong alley to look down.
- I have a family.
- They'll get over it.
I won't talk. I'm telling you.
I know you won't.
Dump him.
- No. No!
- I hate heavy lifting.
No!
- What in Christ was that?
- Who's there?
Show yourself.
- You murdered a policeman, Duke.
- Who said that?
Duke, who said that?
- Shut up!
- The weed of crime bears bitter fruit.
I don't like this. This stinks.
Let's get the hell outta here!
- Shut your hole, Maxie!
- Did you think you'd get away with it?
Come on, Duke!
Did you think I wouldn't know?
Duke, I think you got him.
You're damn right I...
You committed murder, Duke.
- Now you're going to confess to it.
- Like hell I will.
You will, because if you don't, I'll be there.
I'll be there, around every corner... in every empty room, as inevitable as your guilty conscience.
You don't scare me, you son of a...
You will go to the eighth precinct house on Second Avenue... and surrender yourself, and you will do it now.
I confess! I'll do it!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
I'll confess! For God's sake,
I don't wanna die.
No!
No! No!
Drive!
Thank you.
You are probably busy.
You can just drop me off anywhere...
You're Dr. Roy Tam, a professor in the Science Department at N.Y.U.
- Yes.
- I've saved your life, Roy Tam.
- It now belongs to me.
- It does?
You'll become one of my agents... like dozens of others all over the world.
Could I ask my wife about this?
No!
Mr. Shrevnitz here will instruct you... in the way in which I will contact you should I require your help.
When you hear one of my agents say,
"The sun is shining"... you will respond,
"But the ice is slippery."
This will identify you to each other.
Do you understand?
"The sun is shining."
"But the ice is slippery."
Tell me one thing.
How did you know what was happening to me?
How did you know who I am?
The Shadow knows.
Thank you. That's the Shadow!
- I mean, that's the Shadow!
- You're a pretty smart guy.
I heard rumors in the paper, on the radio.
But I thought it was just talk.
I didn't think he existed.
He doesn't. Get it?
Don't ever take it off.
Wait a minute. Who are you?
Somebody who owes him his life.
Somebody just like you.
Boss, you okay?
The Cobalt Club.
Sorry I'm late, Uncle Wainwright, but there was a little... accident on the bridge.
I didn't think you wanted me to wait.
Incidentally, try the prime rib.
It's excellent.
Your usual, Mr. Cranston.
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.
You know, Lamont,
I'm very upset with you.
- What is it this time?
- What is it this time?
What is it every time?
You ask me to dinner and show up an hour late.
- There's no excuse...
- Uncle Wainwright, I'm sorry, I...
I got caught up.
With what, for God's sake?
You don't do anything.
A man your age is unseemly.
At least pick a hobby or something.
Why am I talking to the back of your neck?
Lamont? Lamont?
Sorry. What were we talking about?
I've never meddled in your affairs, going back to the time... after the war when you disappeared for some seven years.
I never asked questions then. I'm not now.
Excuse me, Police Commissioner Barth.
Urgent message for you, sir.
What's the matter?
Cops and robbers business slowing down?
It's a report of that damned
Shadow character again.
You said he was only a rumor.
I'm sick of this Shadow business, his meddling in police affairs.
This time tomorrow,
I'll put a task force on him.
You're not going to appoint a task force.
No. Hell with him.
I'm not going to appoint a task force.
You're not going to pay any attention to these reports of the Shadow.
- Ignore them entirely.
- There is no Shadow.
There is no Shadow.
If there were, I'd be Eleanor Roosevelt.
Where was I?
You were about to tell me who she is.
That's Margo Lane.
Her father is a scientist working for the War Department.
What the hell do you see in her?
Uncle Wainwright, are you sure you're not dead?
Not by a long shot.
Send a bottle of Mouton Rothschild, 1928, to that table.
Do yourself a favor. Stay away from her.
She's strange.
She hears voices. That's what they say.
Really?
Yes, I would like a glass of the Mouton...
Rothschild, 1928.
- Yes.
- From the gentleman.
Gentleman?
Lamont Cranston.
May I sit?
You know... it's the strangest thing, but I have this... sudden craving for Peking duck.
That's so odd.
I was thinking the exact same thing.
Care to join me?
You speak Chinese.
Only Mandarin.
Aren't you full of surprises?
Thank you. I'm glad you like it.
- I had it made at Adrian's.
- Why did you just tell me that?
You just complimented me on my dress just now.
Didn't you?
No, I didn't.
But I was thinking it.
Now that hasn't happened to me in a long time.
Since I was a little girl with my cousin,
I could hear what he was thinking.
Just pick the thoughts right out of his head before he said a word.
It was the strangest thing.
And I never was able...
Is something bothering you?
Oh! No.
Not at all.
Thank you. I had a wonderful time.
I'm not sure I can recall an evening as... stimulating.
Good night, Miss Lane.
Good night, Mr. Cranston.
I like her, boss.
She's different than your usual dames.
- More than even she knows.
- How's that?
She has abilities she's completely unaware of.
No kidding?
You gonna see her again?
- No, it's much too dangerous.
- Dangerous for who?
For me, Moe.
For me.
Someone's coming.
- What is it?
- That's just it, sir. I don't know.
I'd have labeled it a mummy case coming from Tibet like it did.
- Mummy cases come from Egypt.
- That's right. Exactly.
Besides, the thing is metal, which made me think it was a sarcophagus.
No. Tibetan sarcophagi were of stone.
What happened to the truck men who dropped it off?
Gone.
It's obviously an incorrect shipment.
Call our customs broker and...
My God!
This is beautiful!
This is solid silver.
Nelson, help us take the sides off.
- What does it say?
- It's Latin.
"Kha Khan dei potestas in terra..."
"The power of God on Earth..."
"The seal of the emperor of mankind."
Oh, my God!
Temujin.
This is the silver coffin of Temujin.
Who's Temujin?
The man who very nearly conquered the globe eight centuries ago.
How come I never heard of him?
Temujin was the birth name... of Genghis Khan.
What was the shipper's address?
It didn't say.
Label just had the country of origin.
Let me make a telephone call.
Let me help you.
Nelson, whatever you do... don't open it.
No, sir.
- We're closed.
- Join me... or die.
Excuse me?
Join me or die.
This is private property.
- Your mind is weak.
- Don't come any closer.
Fall to your knees.
Put your gun to your temple.
Sacrifice yourself... to me.
Yes, my Khan.
Oh, my God!
I can't believe it.
We were only gone for a moment.
You didn't hear me, did you?
I'm through with the beryllium sphere.
I'm just doing some underwater tests to check pressure.
Farley, I have told you a dozen times, we are doing energy research.
I'm not interested in any military application of the project.
Why'd you let the War Department pay all the bills?
'Cause you talked me into it.
I just wanted enough money to finish.
Dr. Lane, you don't think big.
If you'd only listen to me, the world could be our oyster.
Oysters? I get a rash from oysters.
Oh! Margo.
What a beautiful dress.
And such a clever neckline.
Excuse me, Mr. Claymore,
I'd like to see my father.
So... when are you gonna come down and see my beryllium sphere?
I'm not interested in your spheres.
Margo.
You don't return my calls anymore.
That's not true.
- I never did return your calls.
- I know.
I can't imagine why.
It's because I don't like you.
What a fascinating woman!
Dad, I don't know how you can work with that man.
Margo!
What a nice surprise.
- Hi.
- Have you had your dinner?
Yes, Dad. It's 2:00 a.m.
Where did you get this shirt?
You said I look good in green.
No, this is green. That's red.
Red, green.
To me, it's just a clean shirt.
Dad?
Do you believe in telepathy?
I mean, do you believe that it can exist between certain people?
You mean mind reading?
Of course I don't. I'm a scientist.
So strange.
I've always had this feeling that there was this... indescribable connection out there... just waiting for me.
And suddenly tonight, there it was.
That's nice.
What was it?
It was a man.
And I'm probably never gonna see him again.
But why not?
I just know.
It was as though I could sense what he was feeling.
And now I'm completely and utterly depressed.
That's nice.
Okay, that'll be $4.45.
- What are you doing?
- Writing down the drop-off point.
You are making a record of my destination?
Taxi commission's rules.
All right, Reilly, back her up.
That's it.
You need fuel.
Geez, I need gas.
Cut left. That's it.
Hey, thanks.
Look out!
This must be my lucky...
Call an ambulance!
Scott, you all right?
Hey, stay back! Stay back!
Help over here!
What's going on?
Inspector Cardon is in charge, sir.
He's over there.
Hey, what are you, crazy?
- Out!
- Thank you.
To the sanctum.
Go!
Come on, what are you gonna do, park it here? Come on!
Hey, Louie, save that cab for me!
- Report.
- Our agent in the 26th precinct... reports police investigation of murder at the Museum of Natural History.
Murder.
Agent advises inquiry.
Understood.
I saw you as taller.
Who are you?
Shiwan Khan.
Last descendant of Genghis Khan.
You are naturally deeply honored.
Don't feel obligated to introduce yourself.
I already know who you are.
Not this temporary version of yourself.
I know who you really are.
Ying Ko.
I'm a great admirer.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Please.
It is no more difficult for me to invade your mind than it was this room.
May I sit?
You are hurting my feelings, Ying Ko.
I should have thought you would enjoy to meet another... with the unique ability to cloud men's minds.
- You were a student of the Tulku.
- Yes.
He spoke of you constantly.
But I'm afraid he wasn't able to turn me quite as easily.
Would you happen to have some American bourbon?
I have a bit of a taste for it.
- I'm happy to pay, of course.
- No.
Not at all.
Say, you didn't happen by any chance to... pay a visit to the museum last night, did you?
A wonderful collection of Tibetan tapestries.
Grown men still shiver at your name.
You are, I have to confess, my idol.
Your raid on the village of Barga?
I studied it.
How nice. You remember it.
It rings a bell.
It was a masterstroke.
Swift, vicious, and sudden.
What genius.
So, what brings you to the Big Apple?
My destiny.
Genghis Khan conquered half of the world in his lifetime.
I intend to finish the job.
And how do you plan to do that?
If I told you, it wouldn't be a surprise.
I traveled to this country in Genghis Khan's holy crypt... to absorb his power.
In three days, the entire world will hear my roar... and willingly fall subject to the lost empire of Sianking.
That is a lovely tie, by the way.
- May I ask where you acquired it?
- Brooks Brothers.
- Is that Midtown?
- 45th and Madison.
You are a barbarian.
Thank you.
We both are.
I know that inside you beats a heart of darkness.
You dip into it every time you put on that hat and cloak.
Join me.
You are Ying Ko, the Butcher of Lhasa.
You and only you deserve to be by my side.
Together, we'll pit armies against one another like a chess game.
We'll collect our due of pain and we'll wash our hands in blood.
Your mouth still waters at real power.
I am offering you a chance to take it back.
Be my partner, Ying Ko.
That's not my name anymore.
But it is! Nevertheless, still who you are, isn't it?
For the bourbon.
We will meet again, soon.
The day of the Mongol warrior... is once again at hand.
Soon, with wings outstretched... we fly to our destiny!
Good morning, Mr. and Mrs. America.
Flash: Manhattan reels from yet another report of the elusive Shadow.
I think they made up the Shadow so people would listen to the radio more.
What do you think, Roy?
Some say the Shadow is...
Roy?
Well, it...
I'll get it.
Yes?
"The sun is shining."
"But the ice is slippery."
- You're an agent of the Shadow.
- Who?
Yeah. Right. Gotcha.
What do you need?
I need a metal analysis of this.
Bronzium.
The metal is bronzium.
I didn't think it existed, but here it is.
The ancient Chinese believed this was the very stuff the universe was formed of.
- Where did it come from?
- I'm told it came from Sianking.
If you believed in legends, it had to be Sianking.
They called it the birthplace of the world.
Could bronzium conceivably be used to make some sort of a weapon?
Theoretically, yes.
How?
Supposedly, it's very unstable on the molecular level... constantly given to expansion.
Only the cell bonds hold it in check, but if the bonds were ever breached.
- By an explosion?
- It wouldn't do it.
But if the power of the cell were to turn on itself in an implosion... the molecular imbalance will be released and then you'll have your explosion.
How big?
No man can say.
The breakdown would spread to all levels of the cells' atomic construction.
Fashioned into a bomb, it would be catastrophic.
I guess you'd call it an implosive-explosive submolecular device.
Or an atomic bomb.
Hey, that's catchy.
But it'd have to have a beryllium sphere to contain the apparatus.
No other metal would enhance a blast.
In any case, it's all moot.
None of this would be possible... unless... some genius figures out how to design and make it.
The implosive device.
It would have to be sort of a shell... with tiny implosive charges regularly spread over the surface.
Something like this.
Fortunately... such a device doesn't exist.
Reinhardt Lane.
Reinhardt Lane.
Reinhardt Lane.
Reinhardt Lane.
Yes, my Khan.
You know something, Lamont, that puzzles me?
How a man like yourself who has absolutely nothing to do... can be late for every little engagement.
Practice, Uncle Wainwright.
Lots and lots of practice.
Waiter, get me some more chives, would you, please?
Oh, my God, here comes that Lane woman.
I don't need her anymore, I...
- Hi, Miss Lane. How are you?
- You can drop the act, Commissioner.
- What have you done about my father?
- Nothing we can do unless...
Unless what? He blows himself up?
Margo Lane, my nephew, Lamont Cranston.
Yes, we've met.
Would you care to join us?
The fact that your father is acting strangely...
I don't think really calls for a police investigation.
I wanna see him.
The War Department says... he suddenly decided to take no visitors, not even his own daughter.
Chances are he's working on some top secret.
- It is a government project, you know.
- No, his project is harmless.
Energy research.
Some kind of implosive device.
Look, I know something's wrong.
I spoke to him on the phone.
He was distant, confused, babbling.
He spoke to me in Chinese!
Waiter, waiter.
- He doesn't even speak Chinese!
- I'm sorry, please.
Tomorrow, I'll send a policeman over to the federal building.
He'll see your father and everything'll be fine, all right?
What's your opinion...
Excuse me.
Lamont!
Wait a second, Lamont.
I wanted to ask you about my father.
I have to go.
Ying Ko! Who's Ying Ko?
You will forget about me.
- Why would I do that?
- You will give me no further thought.
Are you drunk?
I don't know what kind of woman you're used to dealing with... but I don't appreciate being...
Hey!
The federal building.
You got it, boss.
- Pizza?
- Yuck.
I'm not going to eat a burger again.
I'm not asking you to eat a burger.
- You like fish?
- How about a burger?
Next time, you get to be on top.
- Where is Khan?
- I will not tell you.
What are you doing?
Hold on or you'll die!
Yes, to serve my Khan.
I sense somebody's coming.
Drive!
- Hello?
- Hello, Margo.
Dad.
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.
I need to see you right away at the lab.
Are you there now?
Hurry.
No, no, no!
Oh, God! Dad!
Dad! Where are you?
Oh, God, no!
Margo Lane.
I have a mission for you, my dear.
Margo Lane.
- What are you doing here?
- You're in my home.
I am? Your home?
- What are you doing here?
- I don't know.
- Who sent you?
- I don't know!
- Who sent you?
- I don't know!
There was a voice over and over in my head.
It said I had to kill the Shadow.
I want you to leave right now.
I had to kill the Shadow and I came here.
I said I want you to leave right now.
And there was only you.
Get out!
Let me see into your eyes.
- You want to see into my eyes?
- I think...
- Go ahead. Look at them.
- I know something I knew before.
Something strange about you.
I could feel it.
But I've got to warn you.
You won't like what you see.
The static in my head whenever I was near you. I knew it.
You're the Shadow!
My father's disappeared. You're the only one who can help me find him.
Just be gone when I get back.
How do you know I won't tell anyone who you really are?
I know.
To the sanctum.
- Nice tie.
- Thank you.
By the way... you sent Margo Lane to kill me.
Kill you?
If I wanted you dead, Ying Ko,
I would've had your liver on a pole by now.
I sent the girl to be killed.
Tell me how did you kill her?
- She's alive.
- Then she's a danger to you.
She now knows exactly who you are.
How long will you let her live?
How long before your pure instincts take over?
I'm onto your plan.
You still don't have the beryllium sphere.
Without it, you can't complete the bomb.
Besides, you know I'm gonna stop you.
You Americans are so arrogant.
You think your meaningless, decadent country... is the new cradle of civilization.
- Let me tell you something...
- That's the U.S. of A. You're talking about.
I am talking about ruling the world!
I'd like to give you a name.
Leonard Levinsky. Brilliant psychiatrist.
- You'll talk, he'll listen...
- You are boring me!
- That knife.
- Recognize it?
I took it from the Tulku.
No, I correct myself.
I took it out of the Tulku after I ran it through his heart.
When will you learn to listen to your instincts?
Instincts?
I'll show you my instincts.
Never did master the Phurba, did you?
Still expect it to respond to brute force.
My Mongol warriors aren't terribly bright... but they are loyal.
Accept the truth.
There is no light without shadow.
And you and I are that shadow.
I would sooner destroy a Rembrandt than kill you.
For the last time, will you join me?
You cannot fool me.
You cannot defeat me.
- Your mind is an open book to me.
- Then learn how to read!
Weakling!
Tail them, Moe.
He's disappeared, boss.
Stop the car.
It's just an empty lot, boss.
I can't help that I know what I know about you.
And I can't forget it either.
It's late.
Sleep here if you like.
There are guest rooms.
But in the morning, you should go.
I'm not afraid of you.
But I am.
Lamont?
Lamont?
Lamont?
Oh, my God.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Oh, God, I dreamed.
So did I.
What did you dream?
I was lying naked on the beach in the South Seas.
The tide was coming up over my toes.
The sun was beating down.
My skin was... hot and cool at the same time.
It was wonderful.
What was yours?
I dreamed I tore all the skin off my face and was somebody else underneath.
You have problems.
I'm aware of that.
I'll wait outside while you get dressed.
That's okay. You can stay.
These are all rumpled.
There might be some things in here that you could use.
Yeah. This belonged to my aunt Rose.
- Really?
- Very fashionable gal, that Rose.
Kept her figure, too.
I've got to run. I've got a...
- Taxi waiting downstairs?
- Excuse me?
I sensed that's what you were gonna say.
It is, isn't it?
Yes.
This is getting easier the more I'm around you.
You're like reading a book.
Thank you, but I won't be needing that taxi.
- You do. I have a very important...
- Great. I'll come with you.
- No! Last night we agreed...
- No, I didn't agree to anything.
Do you mind if I get one little sentence out here?
We agreed you were going to leave this morning.
No, you agreed I was going to leave.
I agreed to no such thing.
- We need each other.
- No.
- We have a connection.
- No.
Then explain why I can read your thoughts.
- My thoughts are hard to miss.
- Why?
- Psychically, I'm very well-endowed.
- I'll bet you are.
Okay, so you don't need me, but I need you to help me find my father.
And I am coming with you.
Okay.
Empire state building pennants!
Get your empire state building pennants!
From there to there.
That is just the explosion.
The destruction will be incalculable.
Good.
What a beautiful day.
Nice dress, toots.
- "Come on along and listen to..."
- Get me down!
Bobby! What are you doing?
I have no idea! Get me down!
- Get me down from here!
- "...The Lullaby of Broadway."
Get me down!
It's all falling into place for me now.
Shiwan Khan needs a beryllium sphere to complete the bomb.
- I wonder where he intends to find one?
- Beryllium sphere?
Beryllium sphere! Farley Claymore!
- What's that?
- Farley Claymore, my father's assistant.
- He was working on a beryllium sphere.
- In your father's lab?
No, he was working on his own.
Mari-Tech labs, down on the south side.
- Good, very good.
- Get outta the way!
I got something else
I want you to do for me.
I was trailing Khan when I lost him on the corner of Second and Houston.
There's something strange about that vacant lot.
Find out what used to be there.
Second and Houston.
What about Farley Claymore?
Mr. Claymore's gonna receive a little visit from the Shadow.
- Farley Claymore!
- Who's there?
Where is the beryllium sphere, Claymore?
Sphere?
What sphere?
Claymore, you idiot!
You're being manipulated.
Your mind is being controlled by hypnosis.
My mind? Controlled?
What have you done with the sphere?
It's too late. I loaded it on a truck.
Take me to it now!
Who do you think you're gonna shoot with that, Claymore?
No one controls my mind, Shadow!
There's a new world order coming, and I'm gonna be a king.
A king!
Margo.
Margo, I need you.
Open the door.
You called?
Lamont?
You're not supposed to be here.
Lamont?
You were dreaming.
You saw.
Do you have any idea... what it's like to have done things you can never forgive yourself for?
Whoever you were... whatever you did... it's in the past.
Not for me, Margo.
Never for me.
We are victorious!
And as victors, we will collect the spoils of war.
I will remember each of you... particularly my special servant... the only American with genius enough... to join me of his own free will... who saw himself a king in my kingdom.
King? Did I say king?
- Maybe not the best choice of words.
- No, it wasn't.
Because actually,
I was thinking prince, tops.
Not even, necessarily. Duke? Baron?
Your choice, of course.
- Get Dr. Lane. Assemble the bomb.
- Of course.
In the name of the new Kha Khan!
The power of God on Earth!
The emperor of mankind!
Extra! Read all about it!
Madman threatens to blow the city sky-high!
Residents of New York City were thrown into a virtual panic today.
Police were still trying to determine if, in fact, the threat was real... or merely an incredible hoax.
Either way, surely the work of a madman.
Morning, Russell.
He's demanded works of art, famous jewels, even gold.
Find Khan and you'll find the bomb.
What did you find out about that lot?
Not much. It was the site of the old Hotel Monolith.
It was finished nearly 10 years ago, but it never opened.
The Monolith. I vaguely remember that.
Seems that's the only way anybody remembers it.
Before the hotel was completed... the developer went bankrupt and committed suicide.
The last record is a sale to a Far Eastern buyer six years ago.
- When was it torn down?
- It doesn't say.
I made some calls this morning to newspapers and such.
All anybody can remember is up to the time it was sold.
Everyone seems to know that it was torn down... but they can't remember when or by whom.
Or if.
I can't believe he did it.
Did what? Lamont?
My God.
It's beautiful.
What is?
Hey, that building right there.
What's the name of that building?
Lunatic!
Shiwan Khan has hypnotized the entire city.
They don't see it.
None of them see it.
But I see it.
You and Shrevnitz will receive your instructions.
- I want you to follow them exactly.
- Lamont!
Bet you wish you'd been a little nicer to me now, don't ya?
Bet you wish you'd listened to my ideas.
Bet you didn't count on me being friends with a conqueror, did ya?
That's enough. Activate the bomb.
Set the timer for two hours.
You are certain you could duplicate this bomb's design anytime I require?
Absolutely. No problem.
That makes Dr. Lane obsolete.
Secure him in a room.
He will die at the hands of his own invention.
Yes, my Khan.
I know you must have this covered, but shouldn't we be getting out of here?
There's an aeroplane waiting to take us all to safety. We leave in one hour.
What is it, Moe?
Is it another one from the bowling league?
Ying Ko.
The Shadow! Where?
Not here, you idiot. In the building.
Can you tell if he's mad at me?
We had a little misunderstanding yesterday... and there might still be hard feelings.
Find him and kill him!
Kill him? Me?
All of you!
Couldn't I just stay here and help you?
Go!
You guys, go that way.
Did you think you'd never see me again?
Claymore
I'm right here!
All around you.
Everywhere around you.
Coward.
Chicken! Sissy!
Come out here and fight like a man.
You're a fool, Claymore.
Get out of my sight!
There's your exit, Claymore.
You know what I love about this job?
The excitement.
Ying Ko. I surrender.
You're finished, Khan.
Phurba!
You are losing your concentration.
Your mind is too weak.
You are beginning to lose your power.
Look at you. Can't even control yourself.
How can you hope to control the Phurba?
Stop!
- My God.
- That's what he saw.
Where am I?
Khan!
- Dad!
- Margo!
- Where am I? What is going on here?
- Are you all right?
Well, there's this guy...
- I'll tell you later. Call the police.
- Okay.
Look! There it is!
Oh, my God! This is impressive work.
- Who did this?
- You did.
We only have an hour left. Disconnect it!
Cut this off.
Dad, the timer! You gotta stop it!
Oh, dear.
Two minutes left.
Oh, my God! Hurry!
This way!
Oh, my God, it's upstairs.
Oh, no, the elevator!
Dad!
Be careful.
No!
- Which wire?
- I just don't remember!
Pick one!
What the hell. It's usually green.
No, green!
This is green. That's red.
I've gotta try to remember that.
What are you doing?
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Where the hell did that come from?
What is this?
Where am I?
You. Come here.
Look at me.
Look into my eyes.
Yes.
Release me at once.
No, we won't have any of that, Mr. Khan.
Let's just have a look at those stitches.
Stitches? What have you done?
Saved your life, that's what.
We had to remove a little section of your frontal lobe.
You'll never miss it.
It's a part nobody ever uses.
But...
Unless you believe in telepathy!
Wait! Come back here!
You! Come here!
I am Shiwan Khan, the last descendant of Genghis Khan! Listen to me!
- I'm Houdini!
- I'm Theodore Roosevelt!
- I am Napoleon!
- I'm Josephine!
- I'm Babe Ruth!
- I'm Henry VIII!
I'm William Shakespeare!
I'll see you later.
Hey, how will you know where I am?
I'll know.
I've got you now, wizard.
Get him!
Search every bush and tree!
Lerigot must be caught!
He's over there! Hurry!
Come on!
Easy now. He's close by.
Keep your eyes open.
There!
There's no escape, Lerigot!
It's all over, wizard!
Surrender to Divatox!
Fools! You let him escape!
COACH: Come on, Rocky!
Focus, Rocky! Focus!
Tommy! Follow-through!
Your follow-through!
Rocky, get back in there. Let's go!
All right. Get in there! Get in there!
Watch out. Come on, move!
Adam, get in there!
All right! Get in there!
Rocky, spinning-heel kick! My hand!
No. Look, you're trying too hard.
CHILDREN: # Row, row, row your boat gently down the stream #
# Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream #
# Row, row, row your boat gently down the stream... #
- Come on, Justin. You know the words.
- I don't feel like singing.
- Do you want to talk about it?
- There's nothing to talk about.
I just don't feel like singing.
OK.
Hey, Rocky. Maybe we are trying too hard.
Maybe we're not trying hard enough.
- Don't move.
- My back!
- Can we get some help?!
- It's gonna be all right.
- Just relax.
- Man, I'm so stupid!
- You're OK, man. Just calm down.
- Don't worry. Help is on its way.
Yeah, that was cool.
Rocky!
Justin, wait!
- Everyone, wait here. It'll be OK.
- KAT: Rocky!
Wait here.
- You'll be OK.
- Hang in there, pal.
Idiots!
You're worthless! And you!
- Me?!
- You lost Lerigot.
You let him get away.
I told you those bolt-brains didn't have a clue.
- Oh, shut up, Elgar!
- Whoa!
Those are your bolt-brains, which makes this all your fault.
Come on, don't punish me.
I'm your favourite nephew.
Phew.
Hey, you two losers,
I nearly got fired for your screw-up!
You're just lucky
Aunt Divatox likes me. Whoa!
- Not again!
- Never send a moron to do a mutant's job.
If you're so great, why don't you do the job, Rygog?
That runt Lerigot is still out there with the key to the island of Muiranthias!
No, thanks. But I'd be happy to lend a hand.
Oh, yeah. Real funny.
- Quiet! Both of you!
- Sorry.
You're giving me such a migraine.
I have a plan.
Once we take away the one thing he values most in the world,
Lerigot will come to us willingly.
Where's my Eely? Where is he?
BABY: Come to Mommy! Come here!
There's my boy! Yes!
I have a date with destiny.
I want Lerigot's family captured and bought here.
Yes, give Mommy a kiss. Yes. ( sniggers )
Oh... Oh...
Argh!
- ( growl )
- Argh!
Alpha... Alpha...
Alpha...
Alpha?
Alpha... Alpha...
Ai yi yi. Zordon! Lerigot, the wizard of Liaria, is here on Earth!
Zordon? Zordon, where are you?!
I'm here, Alpha.
Zordon, you scared the diodes out of me!
I'm sorry, Alpha. I too sensed the arrival of
Lerigot ans was tracking his whereabouts.
But why would he come here? He knows he can't survive on Earth for very long.
Something must be terribly wrong. Pinpoint his location and contact the Rangers.
- If Lerigot is in trouble, we must help him.
- Right. Beginning a worldwide search now.
Rocky?
Hey!
- Brought you a surprise.
- There you go. How you doin'?
- Got you a card.
- And some decoration.
- The doctor said you'd make a full recovery.
- Yeah, but not in time for the competition.
- You guys are gonna have to go without me.
- We don't have a choice.
Without that prize money the shelter's gonna close for good.
You know, Justin's taking this pretty hard.
It's bad enough he lost his mother.
Now he has to face losing the shelter.
- Well, we're not gonna let that happen.
- ( communicators bleep )
- Go ahead.
- Rangers, report to the Power Chamber.
A powerful wizard has arrived on Earth and may be in danger.
We're on our way. Tommy out.
You guys heard Zordon.
What are you waiting for?
- All right. We'll let you know what's up.
- See you, Rocky.
- We'll be back, OK?
- Be careful.
- Ow!
- Who's there?
Justin?
Did you just hear all that?
You guys are the Power Rangers?
Lerigot has taken great pains to hide his exact location. Someone must be after him.
You must find him quickly.
- Tanya and I will stay here just in case.
- Good idea, Adam.
- This could be trouble. Keep an eye out.
- He is in Central Africa.
Equip yourselves with the Power Boxes and teleport there immediately.
- Right.
- He cannot survive the sun's rays.
Ai yi yi!
The short-range locators in your Power
Boxes should lead you to Lerigot. Good Luck.
- Ready?
- Let's go.
Ow!
Alpha?
Alpha?
Alpha...
I've found Lerigot. He's on Earth.
Yes! He must be looking for Zordon.
Excellent. You may kiss my hand. Gotcha!
Earth? Forget it. Let's go back to looting and pillaging. That's what I like!
Never! Lerigot holds the only key to free Maligore, the great flame of destruction and my husband-to-be.
Once we are wed, I will use his powers to raid all the riches of the universe.
Thinking about it just gives me goose bumps!
- Kinda gives me gas.
- Elgar!
You will head the capture of two... two humans of purity and strength.
They'll be my dowry to Maligore. Activate the barrier shields and set a course to Earth.
We're going after Lerigot!
Prepare to teleport!
Hey, hold it. What you got there?
- Just as I thought.
- What is this? Huh?
- I'll check these hot dogs.
- Bulkmeier! Skullovitch!
Beat it, kid.
Sir!
Men, listen up, because you know how I hate to repeat myself. I hate to repeat myself.
You just did, sir.
I needn't remind you of our luck in getting rehired, Men...
I have am important assignment for you.
It's am easy one, but one that will, uh...
- Skullovitch, are you listening to me?
- Yep, I'm with you, sir.
Well, listen to this. Precisely at 1900 hours, you relieve me from duty at the international danceathon. Do I make myself clear?
- Got it, sir!
- Yes, sir!
Would you mind, sir?
- Yeah.
- Thank you.
- Napkin?
- Got one, sir. Thanks.
Wow. Reminds me of parts of Australia.
Got him. The signal's coming from... that direction. Let's go find him.
Wow, this is moving fast.
Adam, come check this out.
That object we're tracking just entered Earth's atmosphere. But its identity is being blocked.
It is likely the reason Lerigot cam to Earth.
An evil energy surrounds it.
Man, I've got a bad feeling about this.
I hope Tommy and Kat make it back soon.
Lt Stone is already gonna kill us for bein' late, so turn right!
Left! Left is north. North Star!
- Look at the stars there, man!
- That star?
- That star!
- That star is moving! Wanna make a wish?
- What the heck was that?!
- I dunno, but keep going!
- The accelerator's stuck!
- Whoa. Stop! Skull, slow down, man!
- I'm trying!
- Skull, there's a building up ahead.
Aaarghhh!
Lerigot's signal is gettin' stronger.
Tommy, do you mind if we stop for a minute?
- You OK?
- Yeah, it's just hot out here.
I know. Want some water?
We still have a lot of jungle to cover.
- Thanks.
- Yeah.
Man, this heat's intense.
Don't move.
On the count of three, jump away.
One.
Two.
Three!
Kat!
Tommy!
Kat!
Zeo Ranger One! Pink!
Kat!
Kat!
Kat!
Kat!
My leg!
- Are you OK?
- Yeah. Are you?
- Yeah.
- My leg...
DIVATOX: What do you mean, you can't find Lerigot?!
And are these my humans of purity and strength?
Yeah. Check 'em out. I even scrambled their brains so they'd be easier to deal with. Ta-da!
- What do you think?
- Urrrgh!
Are you out of your mind?
- ( embarrassed laugh )
- The idea was to woo Maligore, not make him lose his lunch!
I am giving you one more chance.
Don't blow it.
Yes, ma'am. Hey, you heard the lady.
Go find me some more humans, you losers!
Oh, man.
We're headed in the right direction but the signal's gettin' fainter.
He must be weakening from the sun's heat.
Tommy, we've gotta hurry.
Let's go.
Look.
Lerigot.
Lerigot!
Alpha?
Alpha?
Yes.
Alpha.
My name is Tommy, and this is Katherine.
We're friends.
- We're here to take you to Alpha.
- Alpha...
My leg!
He healed my leg.
- Thank you, Lerigot.
- Let's get him outta here.
It's OK.
Alpha, we're standing by with Lerigot for teleportation.
Thank you.
Well, what do we have here?
Two humans, ripe for the picking, and they're heading our way! ( cackles )
Two perfect specimens, worthy of feeding my fiancé.
Throw them into the bilge, where they'll stay fresh for Maligore.
It'll be my pleasure.
Now let's reel, in that little runt Lerigot.
He's probably with Zordon by now.
Remove the mind block.
We'll use his wife Yara to contact them both.
- Is he going to be all right?
- The sun has taken its toll on him.
- This should restore his life force... for now.
- I wonder who's after him.
( moaning ) Yara...
- What's happening?
- Tommy, wait.
Lerigot is receiving a telepathic transmission that is obviously upsetting him greatly.
Zordon, what should we do?
Perhaps if we find out what he is receiving, we can help him.
Alpha, attach the cranial transmission scanner and connect it to the viewing globe.
- Ai yi yi!
- Zordon, I know you can hear me, so listen well.
Lerigot must surrender.
Say hello to Lerigot's family.
Yara, loving wife, and caring mother to little baby Bethel.
Don't you just want to pinch those adorable cheeks?
- Ai yi yi yi yi!
- Make it stop! Look what it's doing to him!
Bring him to me. Oh, and by the way, as a token of my appreciation,
I'll spare a couple of your favourite humans.
They're certainly not much to look at, but my sensors tell me they were once one of your...
Oh, what do you call them?
Oh, yes. "Power Rangers."
- Kimberly.
- Do what I say or it's lights out for all of them.
And Jason.
Yara...
- Kim?
- Yeah?
I think we're in major trouble here.
I'd say.
Wish we could morph.
Doesn't look like there's any way out.
- Hola!
- Ja. Guten Tag.
( Spanish accent ) My name is Antonio Bandanna.
- Bulk?
- Skull?
( German accent ) You are speaking to us?
Who ees this "Bulk" and "Skull"?
- Something's strange with those two.
- You just figured that one out?
- They understand each other.
- As good friends should.
I don't understand it.
Why does Divatox want Lerigot?
I believe that Divatox plans to use Lerigot and his golden key to cross the treacherous Nemesis Triangle into another dimension.
Once there, she will likely travel to the lost island of Muiranthias and attempt to join forces with an evil creature named Maligore.
- Great. Then what?
- Then nothing will be safe.
- Even the Zords could not stop them.
- What? No!
- What's he doing?
- Ai yi yi!
He is performing the Liarian prayer of guidance. Lerigot is preparing to surrender.
- But why? We can't let him do that.
- It's his family, Kat.
- We'd do the same for each other.
- I just hope they're OK.
OK, listen. We'll get Kim and Jason out of there, then we'll go after Lerigot's family.
Kimberly and Jason were Power Rangers once. If anyone can get through it, they can.
Careful. Watch your step.
Look. There they are.
Warriors, let's ride!
Send Lerigot down!
No! Bring our friends closer first!
You have no choice, humans!
This is as close as you get!
Now send the wizard down!
I don't like it. We should stall them and figure something out.
Yeah, I think maybe you're right.
Lerigot's gone!
- Lerigot! No!
- Come back!
Come on, fur ball. Come to Elgar. ( sniggers )
All right! You have what you came for!
Let our friends go!
Swim for 'em! Arrivederci, turkeys!
All right, stop the boat.
You can dump them out right here.
Come and get 'em!
All right, take us back to the ship.
Move it!
I gotta go... I gotta go after 'em!
- No! It's a fake!
- Tommy! Tommy!
- I gotta check the other one.
- Tommy...
Come on. They're gone.
Tommy, come on! Come on!
- I gotta... gotta go after 'em...
- They tricked us.
Double, double rocks and rubble!
Abracadabra-cadabra- cadabra-cadabra-cadabra-whoo!
If only its magic would glow in my hands,
I would have no need for you.
You will oversee our safe passage into the Nemesis Triangle, won't you, twerp?
Set a course for me Nemesis Triangle!
Full speed ahead!
Once we get to the island of Muiranthias on the other side...
As I was saying.
- Once we get to the island of Muira...
- ( fly buzzing )
My Maligore's appetite will ignite once he sees the powerlicious offerings I've brought him.
Those two ex-Power Pukes will be the perfect wedding meal for my Maligore!
OK.
This is so lame. We come back to surprise everybody and help out with the shelter...
Next thing, we're snack food for a monster with the munchies.
Munchies?
Level stabilisers off at 8.40.
- Full throttle on the power output.
- OK, all systems go here.
The Zords you are creating will possess the power to carry you safely through the Nemesis Triangle to resuce Lerigot, his family and our friends.
Behold your new Turbo Zords.
They're just ordinary cars.
No, Tanya, they are extraordinary cars.
Vehicles equipped with the power and velocity of Turbo technology.
Individually, they are formidable fighting machines.
But merged together they form the Turbo
Megazord, the most powerful Zord ever.
Adam, Desert Thunder will be yours to command.
Katherine, yours is called Wind Chaser.
Tanya, Dune Star is your Turbo Zord.
And, Tommy,
Red Lightning will serve you well.
Thanks, Zordon.
- But what about Rocky's?
- Mountain Blaster will stay behind for now.
Remember, Rangers.
Once inside the Nemesis Triangle, communication with the Power Chamber will be impossible.
ZORDON: Here are your new Turbo morphers, five keys similar to Lerigot's golden key.
Individually, they power up your vehicles and give you access to your morphing powers.
But only together are they powerful enough to see you safely through your mission.
Now reach out, Rangers, and accept your destiny.
Ready?
Ready.
Go!
Whoa! I've never felt anything like this!
Wow! This is great!
- All right!
- This is awesome!
- Whoa! This is incredible!
- Yeah!
- All right, guys, let's go to work.
- Right behind you.
- Wait for me!
- Let's do it!
All systems check out. Your Zords are programmed and ready to go.
Take your Zords across the great desert to the sea. There you will find the Ghost Galleon, a phantom ship which will take you and the Zords through the Nemesis Triangle.
You must merge the power of your keys the moment you cross into the Triangle.
The combined power of your keys and the Galleon will see you through safely.
Neither the ship nor your Zords will be detectable by Divatox.
- Ai yi yi! Good luck, Rangers!
- Thanks, Alpha.
- Good luck, and may power protect you.
- All right, Rangers. Power up!
( # "Power Rangers Turbo, Go!" by Super Power )
# Go #
# Go! #
# Power Rangers Turbo, go! #
- Man, this is awesome!
- Desert Thunder ready to rumble.
- Wind Chaser ready to howl.
- Dune Star's gonna shine.
- Red Lightning ready to bolt.
- ADAM: All systems go.
All right. Let's rip some velocity!
Shift into Turbo!
# Power Rangers Turbo, go! #
By accepting this honour, you are also accepting a great responsibility.
As the newest Ranger, you must take your lead from the others and learn to use your new powers wisely.
You will command the Mountain Blaster and be henceforth known as the Blue Ranger.
Good luck, and may the power protect you.
No Power Rangers in sight.
I knew Zordon would get it through his thick skull not to mess with me.
I'm no veterinarian, but I think it's dying.
Oh! We can't let that wretched Liarian thingy die till he opens the gateway to Muiranthias and frees my betrothed!
You guys? I hear the ocean, but... I don't see the ship.
I'll take a look up ahead.
I think I found it.
The Ghost Galleon.
It's amazing.
Hey, guys, check it out.
Rocky?
Wow. Cool.
Justin, what are you doing here?
- Rocky couldn't make it, so they sent me.
- What are you talking about?
- Guys, I'm the new Blue Ranger!
Isn't that cool or what?
- What?
- Man, I was afraid I wasn't gonna make it.
Alpha had to give me a crash course in driving.
Good thing you don't need a licence to drive a Zord.
So, what are we doing here?
We'll talk about this later. Right now we gotta get those cars on that ship.
Let's go.
- OK. Everybody on board?
- Yep, we're all here.
Let's check out the ship.
Hey, you guys, look at this!
I guess we should open it.
Looks like the portal keys also control the ship.
Let's do it.
Hey, the compass is moving.
- And the sails! They're all raising...
- By themselves!
# There's hope for the world #
# Hope for the world #
# Hope for the world #
# Hope for the world #
# And as long as I exist #
# There's hope for the world #
# Hope for the world #
- Do I look fat?
- Nah!
Hell's bells, what is going on now?
Sensors detect the presence of five humans, but no vessel.
What, are they swimmimg?
We're in the middle of the blasted ocean!
Whatever they're travelling on is totally undetectable.
Zordon's little Power Pukes, no doubt.
Why didn't the radar alert us?
I guess it needs fixing.
Never mind.
I'll just leave a little something for those Power Parasites to remember me by.
KAT: Justin, where are you?
- Justin?
- I'm over here.
Why don't you come down below with us?
It's getting pretty cold out here.
I'm way too excited to sleep.
I was just thinking.
If my dad only knew, man, he'd be so proud of me.
And all the other kids at the shelter...
- Justin, you can't...
- I know, I know.
It's for me to know and them to find out.
Ranger's code of honour.
- I won't tell anybody.
- Good.
I guess my dad's still up north.
He had to close down the martial-arts studio after my mom passed away.
Why'd he close it down?
He just... He just couldn't focus any more.
It was like something was missing inside him.
He'll find it again.
He just needs a little time, that's all.
I know. And when he does, we can be family again.
That's important.
Yeah, it is. But you have to remember that we've your family now too.
Come here.
OK. don't stay out too long.
Even Power Rangers need their sleep.
OK.
- He's OK.
- Good.
( croaking whisper ) Help...
Guys... Hey, guys...
OK, once we get there, we'll nead to the middle of the island...
Justin?
Adam, look out!
- Guys! It's time to rumble.
- Let's go.
Justin!
Look out!
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
Aw... Ugh!
Boo!
- This sure ain't the Love Boat.
- What's the Love Boat?
That's it. Kim, move away from the wall for a minute.
Um, sure.
Instead of making weapons, I think we ought to be concentrating on getting this panel off.
Wouldn't that mean all the water would come in?
Yeah. Right now my dive computer says we're at 435 feet.
As we get to Muiranthias, the sub's gonna climb.
Once we hit 100 feet, we pop this off the wall and "boom".
- And make it up in one breath?
- It's our only chance.
At last! We're finally approaching the Nemesis Triangle!
- Begin our ascent! We must avoid the reets!
- You got it.
- Wait till we cross the Triangle.
- We'd better pass through it quickly!
There it is. The Nemesis Triangle.
It's incredible.
Yeah. Whatever's steering the ship sure knows where to go.
Right into the heart of it.
It's time.
- The room's filling up! What's happening?
- I don't know!
We're minutes away from the dimensional gateway.
I don't know how much longer I can hold it.
Look out!
- Tell me I'm not seeing things.
- No. It's the Triangle.
Looks pretty nasty.
Hit the deck!
Do it, wizard. Open the gateway.
Come on, come on. Do it!
You little fool! Open the chamber!
ELGAR: Don't move, you little hair ball!
You may be willing to sacrifice yourself, runt.
But how much do you love your little family?
- Elgar! Grab the baby!
- Right! Come here, you little brat.
Well? What will it be?
That's better. Yeah.
Open the gateway!
Get to it.
- We need something to pry it with!
- Get the pipe.
Good idea.
This should do it.
- OK. Any time, Jason.
- I'm trying!
OK. This water's getting too high for me.
- We go swimming?
- Would you guys be quiet?!
I'm trying to get us out of here!
We're sinking. We're sinking.
OK, OK, don't panic. Don't panic.
We're sinking!
Oh, we're sinking. Gotta go!
- For some reason, we're taking on water.
- Water? Water?!
Water!
We're close to the gatway.
We need the keys.
- You guys go below. I'll get the keys.
- Be careful.
OK. Ready?
Now!
My key! I dropped my key!
My key!
- I can't reach it!
- Hurry, Justin!
I got it! Yes!
Come on! Hurry!
Let's do it.
We gotta get Bulk and Skull first. OK?
You guys? You have to exhale slowly on your way to the top.
Swim now, like a little guppy.
What?! It's coming from the bilge!
Activate the emergency hatch!
- Right.
- Now!
- Quicker!
- OK.
Hope that drain's not clogged.
Now open the hatch to the bilge. Hurry up!
Well, I suppose Maligore will have to do with just one sacrifice.
Man.
Wow. Land ahoy.
Thar she blows! Land ahoy!
Shiver me timbers!
I always wanted to say that.
There it is. The lost island of Muiranthias.
Yep, looks pretty lost to me.
Maligore's volcano is inside the serpant's temple. That's gotta be where they're going.
Then that's where we're goin' too.
Your evergrown hamster ain't lookin' so hot.
No! He must live long enough to open Maligore's sacred temple door.
Now what?
This is impossible! Our radar is detecting five human life forms approaching the island!
I knew they wouldn't let me down, Divatox.
- I have to get rid of those Power Rangers!
- Yeah, they're gettin' on my nerves.
Hi, Rita. D here.
Sorry to wake you.
I forgot about the time change.
Now listen. I know you've had some experience in this matter.
I need your advice.
How do I get rid of the Power Rangers?
The Power Rangers? ( laughs )
If I knew that, do you think
I'd be lying here listening to this?
My advice to you, Divatox?
Run!
Thanks for nothing.
What are you doing?
Stop it!
Let go of me! Stop it!
- She should have better camoutlage.
- What should we do?
We could resuce her.
Or we could enjoy is beach.
Guys, something's wrong.
I can't get a lock on Lerigot.
Desert Thunder's up first. I'll drive to the top of that cliff and see if I can see the temple.
Good. Keep in contact.
We'll get the other vehicles rolling.
Be careful.
Uh-oh.
Hey!
DIVATOX: They've gotta be riding something!
A couple of torpedoes will find out what.
Two torpedoes are armed and ready.
Fire one and two!
Cool view.
- Our cover's blown. Something's coming.
- And it's coming fast.
We can't be detected in the Turbo vehicles.
Come on! We gotta get our butts in those cars!
Hey, guys!
No...
Whatever it was, we hit it!
- Looks like we all got through.
- All right!
- So what do you think, Justin?
- Wow! Can we do that again?
Head for shore.
Yeah!
Come on! I haven't got all day!
Oh, man.
- Where is it? My feet hurt.
- Stop complaining. We're almost there.
Wimp.
- Move it, prisoner.
- ( drumming )
I don't like the sound of that.
Come to think of it,
I don't like the looks of it either.
Hey, the little Power Geek's back.
- So, you want a fight, huh?
- No, no, no. Wait, wait!
Those are the Malachians, guardians of Maligore. Get the wizard. Bring him.
OK. Release the wizard!
Would you hurry up?
Here.
Do it, wizard. Spin your magic.
Lerigot...
Move it, fur ball.
- The little guy packs a punch!
- Give me that!
What a rush! That's right, bow to me, you little peons.
I love being queen. All right, come on, everybody. We've got a wedding to get to.
Here comes the bride!
Watch it, shorty.
Get going. Come on!
Warriors, bring the others.
Move it.
What are you lookin' at? Get inside!
- Guys! We gotta hurry!
- Are you all right?
Lerigot's dying.
We may already be too late.
All right. We'll leave the vehicles, go for a silent approach.
Take out your morphers.
It's time to kick into action. Shift into Turbo!
Yeah! Oops.
Mountain Blaster Turbo power!
Desert Thunder Turbo power!
Dune Star Turbo power!
Wind Chaser Turbo power!
Red Lightning Turbo power!
- Let's do it!
- Right!
- Right!
- Whoa! All right!
Hey, wait for me!
I like it.
I love it, I love it.
Oh, the steaming skulls - perfect!
Put her down over there.
Come on!
Don't move.
Lerigot... Lerigot...
The lava will have to go, but we'll do all our entertaining here.
Of course, you won't be around to see it.
All right! It's time to feed my future husband!
Prepare the humans first!
On your feet!
He can have the Liarians for dessert.
If anyone knows a reason why we two should not be joined in holy matrimony, shut up!
- Sure beats walking.
- You can say that again.
Hear that? We're close. Keep your eyes open.
- Tommy! Over here!
- What's wrong?
- You OK?
- The sound's coming from that way.
- Good job, Justin.
- This is fun! Follow me, I'll lead the way.
- Justin, wait! It's too dangerous!
- I found the entrance!
( chanting ) Maligore! Maligore!
Maligore, great flame of destruction, it is I, Divatox, your one and only true soul mate.
This moment has been long in coming, and now I bring you two perfect specimens to seal our matrimonial pact.
Awake and feed upon their purity.
Come forth and let evil twist their souls!
Be free again and join forces with me!
( chanting ) Maligore! Maligore!
- All right, guys, this is it. You guys ready?
- Ready.
Move out on my command.
Go!
Hey, did we miss the party?
Who invited you?
We did. Rangers, this is Divatox.
Divatox, this is your worst nightmare.
Hah!
Lower them into the volcano.
I'll get the wheel!
Divatox! Give up?
Elgar, go and give Power Boy my answer!
Come back, you little twerp!
What's the matter? All choked up?
Come on, Lerigot. Over here.
Wait here. I'll be back as soon as I can.
- Kim!
- Into the fire!
- You guys!
- Get... outta... my... way!
- No! Let me go!
- Help! You guys!
Too late, Rangers. Even now they are becoming his spawns of evil.
I love it when a plan comes together!
Kimberly! Jason!
That's a nice trick.
Maligore's children! Destroy those who would threaten the flames of unity!
Kim!
Stop!
Leave him alone!
Kim!
Snap out of... urgh!
Let... go... of... me...
- Kim, you've gotta fight the evil.
- Evil is like evil does.
Don't do this!
No!
Leave her alone. Kimberly, no!
No.
Look at me, Kim. Look at me.
It's me.
- It's me. Tommy.
- Yes. We're your friends.
Friends?
I don't have any friends.
Wait.
Oh, yeah. And, sweetie, pink is out.
- You're mine, Ranger!
- No. I don't wanna hurt you.
Into the fire. Into the fire.
Do it. Do it. Maligore's power will exceed!
Throw him in the fire!
No! This one is mine!
- Throw him in the fire! Throw him in the fire!
- Yes. Into the fire.
Now I'm the one with the muscles and the power!
Yeah, that's right, Jase.
But you're not using your brain power!
- Come on!
- Tommy! Hang on!
Come on, Jason. Don't fight me.
You gotta remember.
Remember all the good!
- No!
- You got it. Come on.
No!
- All right, Kim?
- I'm with you!
- I think you're gonna need this.
- Yeah. Thanks.
Back to action!
- I'll get the Liarians.
- Right. Let's finish up, guys.
- Watch it, you Christmas tree ornament!
- Sorry about that.
Maligore! Arise and meet your bride!
Together we will exact revenge on Lerigot, descendant of those who imprisoned you!
Come to me! Please! Aw, come on.
- The humans are turning pure again!
- No!
- Now we don't have a sacrifice!
- Oh, but we do, dear nephew.
We do?
Bye.
Remind me to get another pet.
Out of my face.
Excuse me.
- Why, thank you.
- Any time.
Man! Tough room.
Straighten up! He's coming.
I don't think I like this one bit.
Come to me, Maligore!
Unite our powers as one!
Get ready to take this freak.
He's back!
She wants to marry him?
Are you sure about this?
- I think it's time to break out the hardware.
- Good call, Justin. Let's do it!
- Turbo lightning sword!
- Turbo hand blasters!
Turbo star chargers!
Talk to him.
- Turbo thunder cannon!
- Turbo wind fire!
You look... great. Haven't changed a bit.
Fire!
It's not working!
Whoa! What a hot-head!
What's the plan, Tommy?
That barely fazed him.
Lure brimstone-breath outside and call our Zords.
- All right! I was hoping you'd say that!
- Let's do it!
Adam! Get up!
Oh, man! I can't move!
- Come on! You can do it!
- Hey, your bride's leaving.
I think I hear my mother calling.
- Made you look.
- You have no sense of direction!
And you're ugly.
Everyone! Out the way we came!
Adam, can you make it?
- Yeah.
- OK, let's go! Move it!
You OK?
We gotta get outta here. The place is gonna blow. Come on! Move! Come on!
- Be careful!
- Come on, come on. Here we go.
- Head for the clearing.
- Got it.
- Right behind you.
- Copt that.
Yahoo!
You're goin' on a diet the minute we get back.
Come on! We'll miss the whole fight.
Let's see what this baby's got.
Ready to bring 'em together?
- Wind Chaser ready.
- Ready.
- Ready!
- Ready!
Do it! Turbo Megazord morph sequence on line.
Powering up the Turbo shield armour.
Desert Thunder's ready to rock!
- Dune Star's right there with you.
- This is awesome! Mountain Blaster ready.
# Mighty engines roar #
# Turbocharged for more... #
Initiate docking sequence now!
# Go! #
# Power Rangers Turbo, go! #
# Power Rangers Turbo, go! #
Mountain Blaster's lined up and coming in!
Red Lightning coming in for final docking sequence.
# Go! #
# Power Rangers Turbo, go! #
# Power Rangers Turbo, go! #
# Power Rangers Turbo! #
Megazord turbocharge!
- Ready!
- Let's take care of business.
Let's get him!
Whoa! That was close.
Maligore! Win this one for me, babe!
We got him!
- Ready to fly?
- Ready.
All right. Engage mega Turbo jets now!
Turbo jets full power!
Later, flame-face!
- Good job!
- We did it!
Yes! Yes!
The volcano! It's erupting!
We'd better get out of here.
All my plans!
The money! The jewels! The plastic surgery...
I didn't even get a honeymoon!
You mark my words, Rygog.
The Power Rangers will pay for this one day.
- I never accept defeat!
- Right. No defeat. So what do we do now?
- Run!
- Right.
I want my mommy! Move it!
Hey, guys. How about a lift?
All right. Here we go.
PA: The competition is fierce, as
Angel Grove and Stone Canyon battle it out for the championship and the $25,000 grand prize for their charity.
And Angel Grove scores the first point.
Hey, Coach.
Come on, Adam! Get up!
Angel Grove scores again. One more point and they clinch the championship!
Point!
I'm sorry.
After seven minutes and ten seconds into the competition, the National Championship title goes to the Angel Grove shelter!
- I knew they could do it!
- Come on.
- Way to go, you guys!
- Yeah!
That was so awesome! Way to go, you guys!
Well, looks like the shelter's not closing any time soon.
Come on, Justin.
Yes! All right!
# Riding fast, faster fast #
# Like turbo tigers in the night #
# We are at top speed tracking you down #

# Now it's turbo time! #

Look alive!
Damn it!
Goddamn it!
You call that blocking, you pussy-pukes?
You gotta pick up the linebacker!
Goddamn it! Get off the fucking field, you limp-ass blowdicks!
Consider yourselves dead
Friday night! Dead!
You gonna rejoin the living tomorrow, Stan?
You've got to feel the pressure closing in on you!
Then you get rid of the rock!
Now get focused or get the fuck off my team!
- Shit!
- Let it go.
This better be important or somebody's gonna be doing laps until sunrise.
Yeah? What?
Please let me finish this so we can go home. It's late.
Mrs Brummel, with all sadness, no new computers.
But...
Get the service guy down here and get the old ones juiced.
Mr Tate, you're dreaming.
Absolutely no field trips to New York City.
I don't think that you understand.
You're not getting out of Ohio. Rethink it.
And, finally,
Mrs Olson.
There's just no money for a musical this year.
But I bet the football team gets their new jerseys and their new equipment.
Have you seen the football stadium on a Friday night, Mr Tate?
The entire town is there. This is a football town, let me remind you, and, yes, the team will get new jerseys and new knee pads... and new jock straps and anything else they want in the name of education... because that is what the school board wants.
Because that is what the parents in this town want.
I'm sorry.
My frustrated hands are tied.
I don't see why we can't have a few new computers... so the children will learn a little set up.
Miss Drake, the Drama Club had their heart set on Guys and Dolls this year.
Well... maybe if they use last year's set from Our Town.
Shit, I forgot my keys.
I have to go back.
See you in the morning,
Mrs Olson.
Coach Willis.
What can I do for you?
You look... very, very pretty tonight,
- Miss Drake.
- Have you been drinking, Coach?
I'm sorry to bother you, but...
I can't seem to find a pencil.
You don't need a pencil, Coach.
You need a good night's sleep.
- I need a pencil.
- Sleep it off, Coach.
Do you have a pencil?
Jesus Christ, yes, I have a pencil.
I have plenty of pencils.
Look, why don't you and your pencil go home. It's late.
You look... very, very pretty tonight.
Harassment has a really fine line,
Coach. Haven't you read your handbook?
I've always wanted to do that.
Would Miss Drake please report... to the principal's office?
- I forgot my grade book.
- Unlock the door! Coach Willis attacked me!
- Unlock the door, goddamn it!
- I don't have my keys.
- Let me get help.
- No, don't leave me!
- Where are your keys?
- Wait...
In the office.
I'm gonna get my keys now,
Mrs Olson.
- Please, let me get help.
- No, just talk to me, okay?
Miss Drake... please be careful.
He's insane.
Miss Drake, he's coming!
Hurry! Hurry!
Hurry, Miss Drake!
Hurry!
Hurry!
- Shit!
- No!
Hurry!
Help me!
Prick.
I always wanted to do that.
You fucking bitch!
What the hell were you doing?
Whatever.
All right?
Sorry. My fault.
Crash and burn, Casey.
Get out of the fucking car, you stupid bitch!
Goddamn you!
- You okay?
- Walk much?
You ran into me, beast.
Okay, now listen up.
Since we're all wearing the same uniforms, let's keep the hair the same.
No hair spray, no teasing, just elegant.
- Simple. Great.
- Hey.
Stan, watch it. Those are Estee Lauder lips.
Takes 72 minutes to apply.
Sorry.
- Hey, can we talk?
- I can't right now.
I need a new headline for the school paper. It's important.
- So is this.
- I'm sure you think so, honey.
In fact... it could be just the story you're looking for.
Do the words "editor-in-chief" mean anything to you?
Leave the news to me, okay?
Later.
That chick weakens legs, meat.
- One, two, three...
- No, not the pole!
Yeah, do it again!
Yeah!
Excuse me.
Could you please tell me where the office is? It's my first day here.
Thank you.
I'm Marybeth Louise Hutchinson.
I really love what you've done with your nose ring. It brings out the colour in your eyes.
You're such a fucking pussy.
Hey, fuck you! Fuck you!
Fuck you, man!
Fuck you!
Dude, that's not me.
Doesn't even look like me.
It's fifty bucks, right?
- Does that look like me?
- It's the new you.
I don't know, man. How do we know these things are even gonna work?
Trust me, man.
I'm brilliant.
Then why are you repeating your senior year?
All right, look, man.
I'll throw in a couple hits of this.
Scat. My own recipe.
Guaranteed to jack you up.
Up the nose, right?
Whatever works, man.
Fuck.
Excuse me, Mr Tate.
Try to remember, Harry, the projector's got teeth.
Sharp ones.
We should be getting hazard pay for this sort of faulty equipment.
- Yeah, right.
- Hey, good morning, Miss Harper.
I...
I called you this weekend.
I got your machine.
How's your cold?
- I can't get rid of it.
- Hello. How are you today?
A bit tired, but no complaints.
I got it.
Can we say,
"retirement"?
Maybe you should just go home.
No, thank you.
I'm saving my sick days for when I feel better.
Maybe I should just put a pen in my eye.
When will that bitch turn the air conditioning back on?
Hey, speaking of which, has anybody seen Principal Drake?
Maybe she had a sunstroke and died.
What's up with the coach?
He's thirsty.
Probably a pregame ritual.
Just looking at him makes me want to take a piss.
Good morning, Mrs Olson.
You look very, very pretty today.
So... what was Crusoe's... greatest fear?
Anyone?
Yes, Zeke.
Crusoe's afraid that he'd be stuck on that island forever... with nothing but calluses.
No, that's not correct.
Isolation was his greatest fear.
Yes, but... his external existence in no way compared... to the internal agony of the loneliness he felt.
That's very good.
Like I said, calluses.
So Cathy tells me one thing, and then Liz says another... and then, of course,
Jenny's got her own story, so which one do you want me to print?
Print them all.
He's a jerk.
- Hey, we need to talk.
- No, Stan, baby, I'm in a crunch.
Could we back-burner it?
- I'm quitting football.
- You're not playing tomorrow?
I'm not playing this year.
Would you listen to me?
I'm quitting the team.
I'm not playing ball... anymore.
What brought this on?
Well, I've been weighing the importance of being a jock...
- with my impending future, and I decided...
- You just decided?
Stan, what about college? The football scholarship is your only shot.
If I quit now, I can work harder at studying, maybe raise my grades a little.
I'd rather go to college... based on my intellect.
You're not good at studying.
Stan, you're good at football.
Stick to what you're good at.
Yeah, I've always been good at football and basketball and every other sport I try.
I think maybe it's time I try something
I'm not so good at, something different.
And what am I supposed to do while you're on a yellow-brick quest for a brain?
- What?
- The accepted social order... is head cheerleaders date star quarterbacks, not academic wanna-bes.
Don't be superficial.
"Superficial."
Four syllables.
That's really good, Stan.
You're on your way.
Let me know how the cancer cure goes.
I was hoping you'd be with me on this.
Now, if everyone will turn to chapter four:
"The Nation of the State."
"Only through conformity among the masses... can the unified state offer the benefits of power order and security."
Actually, we covered that last week, Mr Tate.
We're on chapter five.
Whatever.
Now if you could all please join Stan on chapter five:
"Individual Action in Society."
What are you reading?
Double Star.
Robert Heinlein.
You one of those science fiction people?
Y'all believe in alternate universes and alien beings and stuff?
I'm feeling pretty alien myself today.
I'm Marybeth Louise Hutchinson of Atlanta. I'm new here.
- No shit.
- What's your name?
Why do you want to know my name?
'Cause I don't have any friends.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but you seem to have one less than that.
- So I just thought... - Stokely, are you seducing the new students again?
Hi. I'm Delilah.
- Happy to have you at Herrington.
- Thank you.
Don't you love the way Stokely accessorizes different shades of black in her ensemble?
- Fuck you, gutter slut.
- I don't know why you insist... on being such a bad example for your people.
- What people? - I hope you're not a violent lesbian like your new friend.
No.
I'm not aware of any lesbianism in my lineage.
That's too bad, Stokely. You'll just have to keep looking for Miss Right.
Bipolar bitch.
Violent.
Yeah.
- What are you doing?
- I was just eating my lunch, sir.
This ain't the cafeteria, son.
Yes, sir.
I'm sorry about that, sir.
You're...
- I forget your name.
- Casey.
Right.
I've seen you around.
You're not really into sports.
I don't think a person should run unless he's being chased.
"Being chased."
I like that.
Get outta here.
- Mrs Brummel, may I have a word with you?
- Certainly.
Man, get a fucking eye dog.
Maybe if you didn't paint your fucking eyes shut.
- Mr Furlong.
- Present.
Found something on the football field.
Thought you might want to take a look.
- What is it?
- I was hoping you could tell me.
Want to be lab partners?
I didn't know you were a lesbian.
I don't think
I've ever met one before.
Have you been out long?
I think it's very impressive and evolved of you...
I'm not a lesbian, all right?
Be one. Please.
Fly free.
You were right about me. I don't have any friends, and I like it that way.
- Being a lesbian is just my security.
- Your security against what?
People like you.
Complex.
Certain mesozoan... only exist in the kidney of certain squid and octopi.
- Which doesn't make sense because...
- This is Ohio.
Right.
It's a pelagic organism.
- What's pelagic?
- A sea-dwelling organism.
Exactly.
But I don't recognize this surface tissue at all.
Casey, I don't want to blow smoke up your butt, but I think you found a new species.
Yeah, right.
It could happen. New species are discovered every day.
- Don't be so cynical.
- Could it be gnathostomulida?
- No. - They escaped detection till the mid-20th century.
You just know everything.
I'm a contradiction.
Check the mesodermic follicles on its underbelly.
- What does that mean?
- It means we gotta call the university, let them take a look, maybe get in on some of that federal grant money.
Our secret... all right?
- Hey, Stokely, maybe it's from your planet.
- Blow me, blood fart.
Did you see that?
What is it doing?
- You think it's amphibian?
- Water resuscitated it.
Yeah, but couldn't this kill it?
Yeah, you don't want to drown it.
- One way to find out.
- Man.
It's all right.
It's okay.
Mr Furlong, what are you doing?
I'm just gonna check his prostate.
Actually, the surface texture changed, so... I want to feel it.
It can replicate.
Jesus.
Fuck!
Goddamn it!
- I'm okay.
- It has teeth.
Where did it get teeth?
I'm gonna call the university.
I've just been thinking ahead, Coach, and...
I've decided to quit the team... and concentrate on my academics.
Okay.
Stan, we'll miss you.
That's it?
Well, what do you want me to say?
My star quarterback comes to me the day before we play Brun County, the only team in the district that can kick our ass, and tells me he doesn't want to play.
There's something up with that.
You seem to be going through some life-defining turning point, and I'm not gonna stand in the way of the human condition.
You do what you have to do.
Thanks for not reaming me,
Coach.
What kind of human being would I be if I did that?
Hey, give me that back.
Hey, yo, piss wad, you're in my way.
I'm sorry.
I was breathing here.
Yeah, that's the problem.
You're occupying my air, you anal probe.
Hey.
Yo, Stan.
Tomorrow night, right?
That's right.
We'll kill them!
We draw blood! Yeah!
- It must really blow being you.
- You have no idea.
Yo, Casey, is that you?
- Mrs Brummel, what the fuck...
- Please.
Help me.
I can't breathe.
Get help!
You don't know what's happening.
They want everyone.
It's okay.
Is Mrs Brummel gonna be okay?
Stan, Mrs Brummel has been diagnosed with cancer, and she's on a lot of medication at the moment.
It causes disorientation.
We were hoping that she would get through the school year, but unfortunately it...
I hope you can understand the sensitive nature of the situation.
Yeah.
Yeah,
I can keep it quiet.
Casey? You understand?
Casey, you understand?
- Casey?
- Yeah.
Sure.
- It's Neve Campbell?
- And Jennifer Love Hewitt, right?
Yep.
Party of prettiness.
- And they're naked?
- Full frontal.
Zeke, you cannot conduct personal business on school property.
Well, Miss Burke, we have a problem... because I'm sitting on my car and that's my property.
Well, I've had complaints from several students... that you've sold them mind-altering substances.
You want to tell me about it or take it up with Principal Drake?
You're too tense, Miss Burke, but I've got just the thing for you.
You know, Zeke, I'm the authority figure here. It's time you realized that.
"For gentle relief of blockage caused by dietary stress."
- Chocolate-flavoured laxatives.
- You know... if you applied just five percent...
- of that intellect to your studies,
- Not a chocolate lover? you could have made up your finals last summer.
- You didn't have to repeat your senior year.
- How about these?
Condoms.
Magnum-sized, and they're cherry-flavoured.
Come on, Miss Burke.
They're on me.
That's so rude.
I need a lead story.
I have no page one.
Well, we found a new phylum in Biology. It's bizarre.
Really bizarre. Mr Furlong thinks it might be a new species.
Let me race to the stands for that issue.
- Why do you rag on me so much? What did I do?
- Nothing.
It's just your fate.
You're that geeky Stephen King kid.
There's one of you in every school.
- We can't go in here.
- Come on, Casey.
You're with me.
Be brave.
Okay, so what are we looking for?
Anything.
Nurse Harper is medicated.
Big surprise.
Hey.
No, I exposed Mr Tate's alcoholism last year. Nobody cares.
Well, his wife certainly didn't when she ran off with the baby-sitter.
God.
- You can be such a...
- What? pretty cool human being when you're not being a first-class, grade-A bitch.
You hitting on me, Casey?
No. No.
I just think you can be cool.
Sometimes.
This not being one of them.
- Where's Brummel?
- She didn't make it.
Her body was too old.
The heat got to her.
Be careful of the climate.
It compromises your nervous system.
It makes one impulsive.
Has the entire faculty been commuted?
Almost.
- What about the students?
- Soon.
What are you two still doing here?
I thought I was the only left.
There are not enough drugs in this world.
What?
I have a pain.
Right here.
Get off of me! Jesus!
Casey!
What the hell is going on?
- Slow down there. - Help us.
They killed Mrs Brummel. They're after us.
What are you talking about?
- Coach Willis.
- And Mrs Olson.
- What's going on?
- Ask Nurse Harper, okay? They attacked her.
Who attacked who?
What is going on?
I have no idea. I joined this right in the middle of it.
Mrs Brummel wigged out in the shower, and then we found her body in the faculty closet.
What were you doing in the faculty closet?
- Coach Willis and Mrs Olson attacked
Nurse Harper. - Why would they do that?
There's Nurse Harper.
Just ask her.
Now we can get to the bottom of this.
- Fuck.
- Delilah, run!
Delilah, wait!
In here?
Yes. The body was in the closet.
- And why would Mrs Brummel be in the closet?
- Because they killed her.
- That's right.
- Hey, Casey.
Sorry about that mix-up earlier.
Didn't mean to scare you.
Apparently, there's been a misunderstanding.
Still, if we could just see inside the closet.
Certainly.
- It's a doll.
- Meet Resuscitation Annie.
We use her to teach C.P.R. to the students, although I guess she does resemble Mrs Brummel slightly.
- You dialled 911 for a dead doll?
- That wasn't there.
They put that there.
Look, I'm not making this up.
- You gotta call Delilah.
- We called her. She isn't home.
She was here with me.
She saw it too.
They attacked Nurse Harper.
- Nurse Harper is epileptic. She's prone to grand mals. - She had an attack.
Luckily, she carries her medicine in her bag, so we were able to help her.
We think it was brought on by this terrible cold she's had. I took her home myself.
- You can call her if you like.
- It is procedure.
You can use the phone in my office.
That was some fast running you did down the hall, son.
We could sure use your speed.
There's plenty of chasing on the field.
Did you hear that, Casey?
He said you had speed.
- Thank you.
- Good luck in that game tomorrow, Coach.
This way.
Cas, what's gotten into you?
Evelyn knows someone downtown.
A professional.
I'm gonna make an appointment.
He's a straight-A student, and now he needs a professional?
- Christ.
- I don't need a shrink. I know what I saw.
Well, we've just spoken... with both Mrs Brummel and Nurse Harper.
- They got him.
- There's nothing here.
Just some kid looking for some attention. Let's go.
All right.
Well...
I am so sorry,
Miss Drake.
Maybe if you and I spoke privately, we could come up with...
No. No, Mom.
Maybe you're right.
Maybe I should see this woman, this doctor.
Can we just go?
We'll take care of this at home, Miss
Drake. Again, sorry for all the trouble.
I can see how it all got out of hand.
It's a pretty bizarre series of events.
It's our fault.
It won't happen again.
See you tomorrow, Casey.
Check his school books.
They hide the drugs in the spine of the book. We saw it on Dateline.
- What are you on, son?
- I'm not on drugs.
That's government property, Dad.
Shit.
Look, we love you, son.
We want to help you.
Then believe me.
I'm telling the truth.
Something really weird is happening at school. The teachers...
- Something's happened to them.
- Don't push it, all right?
- I'm bending as far as I can, but if you push it... - Just let me call Delilah.
Please?
Okay, that's it.
Your privileges are now over.
No phone. Sorry. Over.
No internet.
You'll go to school, straight to school, and you'll come straight home. You got it?
I'm not going back to that school.
They're waiting for me.
You'll go. If I have to tie you to the desk myself, you'll go.
No music.
His porno.
Porno.
Sorry, pal. No more flogging the bishop.
We are gonna get you help. Don't worry.
Get your room cleaned up.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Dad. They're here.
The faculty.
Get in the house, now.
I'm losing it.
- Go on, son.
- Dad, I'm begging you.
Please.
Come home right after school.
Your mom's looking into a doctor.
Mr Connor.
Delilah.
Wow, you look...
Don't. Come on.
Your attention, please.
Will the following students report to the office:
James Archuleta,
Tina Dannhausen, and Delilah Proffitt.
- This is all your fault.
- What do you mean?
Do you think I'm in drag for the aesthetics?
They're after me.
- Did you tell your parents?
- My mom didn't believe me.
She drinks.
It was a nightmare.
- Look, we have to go to the police.
- No.
- They've got the police.
- We don't know what they've got.
Look, you saw it.
Mrs Brummel was dead.
- They attacked Nurse Harper.
- "They"? Who are "they"?
Casey, we don't even know who "they" are.
Why did she act like everything was okay?
It's a devil's cult or something.
Maybe they worship comets.
Who the fuck knows?
I'm not gonna stay in a handicapped bathroom for the rest of my life.
- They couldn't have gotten to everyone.
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to find Stan.
- Stan? Why Stan?
Will the following students please report to the office:
Jennifer Qulick,
Randy Knotson and Thomas Nicks.
You should just go talk to him.
No way.
I'm sorry.
So you... Are you ready for the big game?
I quit the team.
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.
Why?
Just tired of everyone kissing my ass
'cause I'm captain of the football team.
You know... the coach, the students, even the teachers.
Last year after we won the 2A Conference...
That was thanks to you and your completed passes.
You follow the games?
I wouldn't have guessed that.
I made a "D" on a biology test right after, and Mr Furlong changed it to an "A."
He said I deserved for having such a strong arm.
That really bugged me, you know?
I worked hard for that "D."
That was my "D." I deserved that "D."
I just wish people would let me be, you know...
A "D" student.
Yeah.
Okay, class, listen up.
Today we are going to write a living family history.
Everyone take out a piece of paper and write down the name... of every living member of your family.
Begin with your immediate family... those living with you... then include the names of your nearest living relatives.
What?
- Is this gonna be on the test?
- This is the test.
What is that?
It's magic dust.
- You want some?
- No, I have a low tolerance, but thank you.
- You sure?
- I'm allergic to aspirin, so that would probably kill me.
- We wouldn't want to do that.
- No.
I'm Marybeth Louise Hutchinson of Atlanta.
Atlanta.
I know.
That's right.
You know everything.
I'm Zeke.
- I know.
- It's a pleasure.
The pleasure's all mine.
There's a mandatory meeting in the office at lunch today for all club presidents.
Remember, tonight we take on the Brun County Changa.
- Please come at 5:30 and show your support.
- Hey, that's mine.
Weird, isn't it?
- What do you think it is?
- Locker search maybe?
Something weird is going on here.
Hey, Football.
Hey, Gabe.
- You're not pissed, are you?
- About what?
I'm the new team captain.
What's going on here?
Nurse Harper, she's giving an ear exam or some shit like that.
And that takes the police?
Stan, I need to talk to you.
I didn't know you wore glasses.
Contacts.
Come on, it's important.
Stokely, got a second?
I need your help.
So after the accident, I came here to live with relatives, you know.
So I moved in with my cousins and... here I am.
Fucking do something, you pussy puke!
Yeah, my mom and dad are dead too.
- Really?
- Yeah.
They're still breathing, but for all intents and purposes, they're very much dead.
You've fucking gone weird.
Fuck you, you pussy.
- Fuck you!
- You and I have a lot in common then.
Yeah.
- You notice anything off today here at school?
- I'm from the south.
- Y'all are off.
- Dude, we need some scat.
Yeah, man, we can't deal.
There's some weird shit going down here.
Five bucks a pop. Hey, man, how's the new you working out?
Working out just fine.
Hey, you got any more?
- Sure, man.
- Really?
Why don't you give us all you got?
All right.
Dough.
- You got any more?
- Not on me, man.
- What about in your locker?
- How about in your car? Got any more there?
- Use in moderation, boys.
- Come on, Zeke. Hook us up.
- Check out Miss Burke.
- Wow, what happened to her?
Man, I'm really not in the mood,
Miss Burke. I'm clean.
- What's up with her?
- Not today.
It's too damn hot, and I got zero-fucking-tolerance.
Eat me, you asshole. I'm the one with no tolerance, you pathetic little runt.
Ouch. Comeback.
What are you gonna do?
Are you gonna call my mother?
And how am I supposed to do that, little Zekey boy?
Do you even know where she is?
Europe, Sri Lanka, Japan? I wonder what remote location she went to this week... to hide from her great big bastard mistake.
I've taken your shit for too fucking long, you dickless drug-induced excuse for a human being.
- Woman, what are you on?
- "Woman"? Did you just say, "woman"?
I'm sick of you, little boy.
And if I see you peddling your wonder dust again,
I'm gonna shove my foot so far up your ass... you'll be sucking my toes till graduation.
Big trouble.
She got some bad shit.
And then they chased us, but we got away.
All this started when Mrs Brummel did a wet and wild...
- in the boys' locker room?
- I think so.
Everybody's been acting really strange, especially the faculty.
Tell me about it. It's like they've all turned into fucking pod people...
- or something.
- Into what people?
Invasion of the Body Snatchers.
A small town was taken over by aliens.
That was a joke.
Look, what if it really happened?
- What if that really happened?
- I think something's taking over our school.
The Body Snatchers is a story somebody made up, dingus.
It's located in the fiction section of the library.
So is Schindler's List. All fiction is based on some truth, right?
What does Miss Burke teach us in English 101? Write what you know.
How do we know this writer guy...
- Jack Finney.
- didn't encounter aliens in his high school... which led him to write a book about an alien invasion?
- Your conspiracy theory is flawed.
- How so?
Jack Finney's The Body Snatchers is a blatant rip-off... of The Puppet Masters by Robert Heinlein.
So you can completely disregard that entire work.
Whatever.
The point is they're here, they've been here and they're here again.
You know, Casey, I think you've been racked into the flagpole one too many times.
Look, how do you know there's not a conspiracy?
Maybe X-Files is right.
Where do all these movies come from anyway?
How do we know Spielberg,
Lucas, Sonnenfeld,
Emmerich haven't been visited by aliens?
You know, maybe they're aliens themselves.
Maybe they're simply preparing us for what's to come.
You know what, Casey, it's fiction. Okay?
- It's science fiction.
- Exactly.
Everybody gets hung up on the science part, which has nothing to do with it.
They're getting at us through the fiction.
So, aliens have just been setting us up over the years, creating this happy little make-believe existence... with their E.T. and their Men In Black movies... just so that nobody would believe it if it really happened?
I think so.
Yeah.
- You're not buying this, are you?
- No, I'm not.
But it's kind of cool.
Okay, so what's missing?
Well, in The Body Snatchers, they were pods, but where are they?
I mean, where are the pods?
There are no pods.
There's gotta be something else.
In Puppet Masters, they were parasites.
- I filled Stan in.
- Come with us. Stokely's onto something.
Really?
Shit.
Furlong must have sent it up to the university.
- Doubtful.
- Where else could it be?
What? What is it?
Will someone please tell me what the hell's going on here?
It all started yesterday when
I found this thing, this new species.
Which is now missing.
We think aliens are taking over our school.
Right. Come on.
You saw what Brummel did in the shower.
I saw her dead body in the closet.
They've been calling students into the office.
The students with the most influence on down, including the new team captain.
Looks like you picked the right week to quit football.
You think aliens have infested our school?
That would explain their weird behaviour, wouldn't it?
Give me a fucking break.
So, what are we doing in here?
Shopping.
- I've got a very large grocery list.
- What are you talking about?
This is where
I get my equipment.
You borrow it from science labs?
I like to think of it as stealing, actually.
Just doing my part to the deconstruction of America.
So if anybody finds us in here, just grab ahold of me and pretend we're making out.
The punishment will be less severe.
- Aliens?
- Do you have a better explanation, Stan?
Great. Just listen to yourselves.
Our teachers are aliens?
That's not weird, that's fucking psychotic.
Come on, guys.
This is nuts.
Then leave, Stan. Why are you hanging around? Go win a Pulitzer.
Blow me, Delilah,
'cause I'm sick of your shit.
Get the fuck out of here and take your freak dyke with you.
Fuck you, tit bags.
- Will everybody calm down, please?
- All right, Casey.
Let's go alien for a second.
Why here?
Why Ohio?
If you were going to take over the world, would you blow up the White House
Independence Day style... or sneak in through the backdoor?
Casey.
Man, the only person in this school who is an alien... is you, man.
Fuck you, Zeke.
What's going on here?
Shouldn't you people be in class?
Well, it's like this,
Mr Furlong,
Casey here thinks you're an alien.
- Really?
- The whole faculty, actually.
Is that true?
Casey?
The thing I found yesterday...
Where is it?
I sent it to the university.
Do they know what it is?
Look, sorry to impose and disrupt, Mr Furlong, but...
If you'd kindly take your seats, this will be over quite quickly.
Now sit down!
- Put him the fuck down, Furlong.
- This is for the best, Zeke.
Goddamn it!
Come on.
No!
Zeke.
This is usually the point where somebody says, "Let's get the fuck outta here."
Let's get the fuck outta here.
Aliens are taking over the fucking school.
We gotta have proof.
All right, everybody, here's the deal.
We're heading straight for the parking lot.
Pull it together, and try to stay calm.
Stokely.
What's Stan hanging out with those guys for?
Delilah.
My car.
- Where are we going?
- Anywhere but here.
Wait.
Stan!
- There he is. Let's go.
- Where you going, buddy?
- We're going to...
- Come on, Stan. Jesus Christ.
- Get in the fucking car.
- Sure you don't want to play with us?
Nah, Gabe... but thanks.
What the fuck is going on?
Let's see if anybody's talking.
Who the fuck are these guys?
All right, pull over here, fellas.
- Fuck this shit.
- Hey!
- Where's your mom and dad?
- Europe, I think.
Shit.
- My God.
- This is some serious shit.
This is your big secret?
Caffeine pills?
You didn't see that.
What are we gonna do with the police not being an option?
I can call my dad.
He'd know what to do.
If he's even your dad anymore.
It's called a gun, man.
What is it?
We're gonna find out.
Hey, come here, Oscar.
Come here, buddy.
Jeez.
Now what?
I'm sorry, buddy.
See? It's a parasite.
It attaches itself to a host, and then it controls it.
- It's incomplete.
- What do you mean?
It can survive on its own, but it's really part of a greater organism.
Look, it has the ability to replicate, but it needs a host.
Something moist.
See what it did to Oscar's insides.
It dried them out.
Hey, isn't a human body composed mainly of water?
They're using us.
- Drying us out.
- Like Mrs Brummel, right?
I overheard the coach.
Her body was too old.
She didn't take.
See, this partially explains what happened to Furlong.
That drug's a diuretic.
Dries it out. Kills it.
They're using us as hosts. They're just turning us into mindless slaves...
- they can control.
- How do you know that?
She doesn't.
She's a Trekkie sci-fi freak.
Who's been right so far.
How do we stop it?
Yeah, Stokely, this is your area.
In theory, they're all connected.
- If we kill the master, we get them all.
- "In theory."
What happens to everybody else?
The ones who've been taken over?
Do they just die?
No, they don't.
They would become human again.
But that is in theory, so...
So if we found the leader and killed it,
- we'd beat it.
- What are we even talking about?
- I say we get the fuck out of town.
- And go where?
Don't you see? We got to stop it or it's gonna spread.
It took the high school in a day and a half.
Give it a week, we'll never outrun it.
- We have to fight.
- Fight what?
We don't even know who's alien and who's not.
What if one of us was an alien right now? How would we know?
He's right. How do I know you're really Casey?
How do I know you're really you?
In Body Snatchers, humans became emotionless.
- They completely lost their identities.
- The coach had emotion.
I mean, he's usually a real hard-ass, but he was different somehow.
His behaviour was slightly odd.
Like a star quarterback who mysteriously quits the football team?
What are you doing, Delilah?
I'm just pointing out your "slightly odd" behaviour, Stan.
You've been acting really weird the last couple of days.
I'm not an alien,
I'm discontent.
- There's another big word.
- You want to talk slightly odd?
What about you? You haven't been without your contacts... or hair spray since birth.
- I'm incognito.
- We just have to trust each other.
And I'm supposed to trust you? Tell me something,
Miss Lesbian, when did you start liking boys?
- What the fuck you talking about?
- I see the way you look at Stan.
So when did you stop muff-diving?
She's not a lesbian.
That was a hoax.
- Really?
- Yeah.
And what about you,
Miss Atlanta?
It's just really convenient that you showed up the second all these things started happening.
- What are you doing in Ohio anyway?
- It's not my fault.
Hey, shut up.
She's got a point, Zeke.
Yeah, Zeke, Professor.
I mean, you seem to know an awful lot about this stuff.
No offence, but you're not exactly known for your academic achievements.
Neither are you, man.
- Casey, when did you become Sigourney Weaver?
- Wha...
All right, this is getting us nowhere.
I got a solution.
We know this outs them, right?
Take a hit.
No way, man.
I don't do drugs.
Come on, man. If you're not an alien, you got nothing to worry about.
Zeke's right.
This is the only way to know for sure.
Yeah, come on, Stan.
What are you afraid of, man?
Look, we all do it.
- Casey.
- Why me first?
It's your birthright, man.
Just fucking take it.
Easy, boy.
What about you, Zeke? How do we know you're not one of those fucking things?
I don't get high on my own stash, man.
Fuck that, man!
You're taking it.
You're taking it.
Now what the hell's wrong with him?
Nothing's wrong with him, you asshole.
He's tweaking.
Let him fucking tweak!
Tweak. Tweak.
Now you.
Your turn.
Stokely.
I'm not putting that hack drug up my nose.
- It's so '80s.
- Aliens are taking over the Earth. Weigh it.
- What's in it?
- Mostly caffeine. Some other household shit.
Shit.
Now you,
Delilah.
No. Her first.
- I'm allergic.
- Yeah, and I'm Portuguese. Who cares?
Is she always this much fun, man?
Sometimes she can be a real bitch.
You know what I'm saying? You know?
You both take it.
Zeke, I can't.
You know, I can't.
You have to take it.
Showdown.
Del?
Shit!
Shoot her. Shoot her in the head, Casey.
- Stan, I don't know what's happening.
- Shoot her, Casey.
- Don't shoot her, Casey. - Shoot her, Casey.
She's fucking one of them, man!
There's nowhere to go.
Nowhere to hide.
We're everywhere.
I'll fucking shoot her.
Shit!
Jesus!
Get her!
She's getting away!
- Hurry!
- Shit!
I should have known that crazy bitch was one of them.
We can get her back, Zeke.
We can get them all back.
She destroyed most of my supply.
Look, if we kill the queen, we can get them all back.
Fuck!
- How much do we have left?
- Not much.
But we only need enough to get the queen.
- We get her, we get them all, right?
- I think so.
- Where are we gonna find her?
- Friday night? Only one place she can be.
Go Hornets!
He crosses the field!
Eludes the tacklers!
Tackled by four Hornets with authority.
Somebody stung by the Hornets!
Come on, ladies!
Let's play four quarters!
Jesus.
Get in there and take his fucking head off.
Kill! Kill!
Kill!
- You think it's Principal Drake?
- Who else?
She's in charge.
It would make perfect sense.
They're getting everybody.
I mean, the whole town is here.
By morning, there won't be a human left.
Come on.
Where are you guys?
We found Drake.
She's at the game.
What are you kids doing in here?
The gym is closed.
All of you come with me.
We can't do that,
Miss Drake.
Why is that?
Get her.
Quick, Zeke, get the doors!
Get me out!
You're all expelled!
- Stop the act. No one's buying it.
- We know who you are.
You're in a lot of trouble.
What are you doing?
- You ready?
- Yep.
Sniff this.
- No.
- Sniff it or he shoots you.
I will not.
Now what?
We do it the hard way.
With Mr Furlong, we plunged it into his eye, and the reaction was instantaneous.
You stick her, and then I'll shoot her before it erupts all over the place.
Casey, are you on drugs?
- What's wrong?
- Are we sure?
Please don't, Casey!
Don't wuss out, Casey!
Just do it!
What if we were wrong?
Stab it and find out.
I think we made a mistake, guys.
She's dead.
Easy!
Is that it?
Let's see if it worked.
It better have worked, or there are gonna be a lot of infected people going home.
We're right at ground zero.
You guys stay here.
I'll go check it out.
I'm gonna need some scat.
Use it wisely, man.
What if it wasn't Drake?
Then we're fucked.
I just don't want to never have done that.
What are you looking at?
Coach.
Jesus, I wish I'd never come here.
I don't like this place.
Any sign of him?
I can't tell.
I can barely see anything.
Quick, Stokely, open the door.
No, Stokely! We don't know if it's still him.
No, it's me.
Listen, it wasn't Drake.
It's the coach, and he's right after me. Open the door.
Don't do it, Stoke.
Prove it, Stan. Where's the drug?
I lost it. The coach was too fast for me.
Please, Stokely, don't leave me out here.
- Last one, man. - Please, I'm begging you!
Don't leave me out here!
- Come on, Stokely. Open the door.
- There, try it.
Okay, I'll do it. I'll...
Just let me do it inside.
Do it right now, man.
- Take the test, man.
- Stan, take the drug, man. Prove it to us.
Okay.
Fuck!
Fuck!
Open the door.
It is so much better.
There's no fear... or pain.
It's beautiful.
And you will be beautiful.
You'll be beautiful.
No problems or worries.
We want you.
I want you.
I want you.
Now open the fucking door!
- Open the door!
- Come away.
Go a-fucking-way, Stan!
It's too late, Stokely.
We've already won.
No pain, Stan?
Well, come in here, and I'll show you some fucking pain!
I say we go for the coach.
He turned Stan.
He's the one.
Would you rather wait for them to come to us?
Either way, we're completely unarmed.
Maybe not. I might have some more scat.
Where?
- In my trunk.
- In your trunk.
In your car, amongst the aliens.
That's convenient.
You got a better idea?
Stan?
You out there, buddy?
Does it really take two of us to get to your car?
Nope. One of us is a decoy.
Get him!
Where did he go?
- Check over there.
- Come on! Find him!
Hello, Casey.
Where are you gonna go?
Class wuss.
Eternal little loser... who comes to school every day knowing that this is it.
You've been labelled pathetic... since first grade, and you're afraid it's gonna bleed over for the rest of your life.
But we can stop it, Casey.
We can help you belong.
Isn't that what you really want?
Please don't do this,
Delilah.
I haven't been this happy since probably... since before my dad died.
You know you want me, Casey.
Come on.
Let's do it together.
Hello, Miss Burke.
Hello, sweetie pie.
- What are you looking for?
- Nothing important.
So, I take it you changed your mind about the chocolate laxatives?
Actually, I had my heart set on something cherry-flavoured. You know what I mean?
Sorry, I'm all out of those.
I might have something else for you though.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- Something tasty?
- Let me hook you up.
Hello, Zekey boy.
You're too tense, honey.
Relax.
Fuck this.
I'm outta here.
I always thought the only alien in this high school was me.
Not the case.
Who do you think it is, the master alien, the queen bee?
It could be anyone.
What happens at the end of these stories, Stokely?
How does Invasion of the
Body Snatchers turn out?
They get us.
They win. We lose.
Do we?
Maybe we really win.
Stan didn't look unhappy.
That's 'cause it wasn't Stan.
They took away who he was.
Maybe they just bettered who he was, cleared away his confusion.
I know you pride yourself on being the outsider, Stokely, but aren't you tired of being something you're not?
I know I am.
No fucking way!
Shit!
Run, Stokes!
Stokes!
Stokely!
Stokes! Stokes!
Stokely!
No!
Stokely!
Come on, Stokes.
Run!
Come on!
- Hello?
- Zeke, I'm over here.
Watch out.
It's her.
- Zeke, don't believe her. It's her.
- She attacked me. Please, Zeke.
- What's going on here, Marybeth?
- Please, it is her.
She's lying.
She's trying to fake you out.
We don't know what she is: gay, straight, alien.
Answer me something,
Marybeth:
Why are you naked?
Does it bother you,
Zeke? My body?
- I'm getting kind of used to it myself.
- But I saw you take the test.
Zeke, how the hell can you be sure what you saw?
It was sweet of you to bond with me.
To be nice to me was sweet.
Will it work again, baby?
Do you like what you see?
Zeke.
- Take this.
- Now, Marybeth.
- You sniff it.
- You're out of your fucking mind.
I'm not taking any chances. I leave for five minutes, and everyone's an alien.
Now if I have to Men In Black your ass, you're gonna fucking sniff it.
Happy now?
Jesus. I'm fucking seeing two of everything.
Zeke. Zeke!
Come on, buddy.
Get up.
He's over here.
Casey, come out, come out, wherever you are.
You know, in my world, Casey, there were limitless oceans as far as the eye could see.
A beautiful home until it started to dry up.
So I escaped, came here and met you.
All of you.
All of you were different from the others.
Thanks, pal.
You were lost and lonely, just like me.
And I thought that maybe
I could give you a taste of my world: a world without anger, without fear, without attitude.
Where the underachiever goes home at night to parents who care.
The jock can be smart, the ugly duckling beautiful, and the class wuss doesn't have to live in terror.
And the new girl... Well, she can just fit right in with people who are just like her.
You see, Casey, even Marybeth's feelings can be hurt... by a bunch of pathetic, lost, little outcasts... who truly believe that their disaffected lonely life... is the only way they can survive.
I can make you a part of something so special, Casey, so perfect, so fearless.
Don't you want that, Casey?
I'd rather be afraid.
Fine. All right.
Have it your way.
'Cause this is where your land of fiction gets it right.
We win.
End of story.
Guaranteed to jack you up.
You wouldn't have liked it here anyway.
Stokes. Stokes.
Are you... you?
I think so.
I hope so.
Fuck!
- Shit!
- Is it over?
Yeah.
All right, you little fuck-pukes, quit screwing around!
As you can see, life has returned to normal at Herrington High... after the mysterious disappearance of several faculty members one month ago.
Both the local authorities and the F.B.I. have largely discounted... several students' claim that an extraterrestrial was involved.
A spokesperson for the F.B.I. has indicated... that no substantiating evidence has been found.
That goes for you too, Zeke!
Just 'cause you're the new guy doesn't mean we're gonna cut you any slack!
Put that butt out and get in there!
Now bring that camera over here.
When do you think they're gonna find a new story?
Haven't they milked our little high school invasion to death?
Although there has been no evidence of foul play, the criminal investigation is ongoing.
No regrets?
None whatsoever.
So, how does it feel to be a hero?
It's all right, I guess.
I don't know, it's...
- different.
- That's him over there. Hey, Casey.
Your fan club's here again.
Network or local?
Both.
You know, you can be pretty cool sometimes.
Things sure have changed, haven't they?
These are gonna be great
Can you imagine if your wife ever found these?
Crys, come on
Put down the camera
This is such good shit
Come on, Crys
Crys, come on...
What do I look like to you, a '"Playboy'" bunny?
You're not gonna come and take pictures... and let me take the picture
I'm gonna fill up the whole scrapbook
Peisha, this is the most fun
Peisha!
Oh, shit
Fuck
Crys
Ow! Fuck!
Crys, Crys
What's wrong with him?
Shit
What's wrong, Crys? What happened?
Jesus Christ
Don't look at us, it was his shit
Are you sure he's dead?
Take the girls to the club
I got to call his people
I can't believe I voted for this asshole
It's not about winning ball games
It's about emotion
You know what that is?
Emotion?
The Lakers are not the Lakers without Rambis
He was the spark, the inspiration
He was white
I didn't say that
But did it ever occur to you that's why they let him go?
Rambis left on his own
Is that a brew in that bag?
On his own?
Yeah, on his own, read the paper
Oh, come on!
Christ, Moony, we're on duty... and that shit you're eating is sixty percent grease
He's got one
Dillnick? I don't believe it
Miss? Excuse me, miss
You talking to me, Elvis?
Oh, shit
What kind of action you looking for?
I was kind of hoping you could tell me
Translation, he doesn't know
Now she's gonna stick her balloons through the window
Magic fingers are twenty
Fifty puts the pig in the blanket
You want something oral, see you dentist
Did you see what he was wearing tonight?
He wasn't wearing that striped thing, was he?
So, what?
Looking for something kinky?
Want to hear the chef's special?
No, I'm sure whatever you do will be fine
Hope you have lots of raincoats... because I don't ride bareback anymore
We're meeting him at the Bowl?
Yeah, sounds like we better hurry
Nice jacket
Seersucker makes me hot
Just relax
Just let me take control
You'll love it, believe me
Stone
Come on, Moon, forget him
We got to meet Dill, Moon, leave him alone
Ah, Jesus
Promotions are next week
He's speeding
Being a cop's like being a pitcher, Harry
To hit the strikes, you've got to...
Risk your balls, for what, Moon?
What is this?
This is initiative, I'm showing initiative
No, this is harassment
There is something very perverse about you and this Stone
Perverse? Yeah, perverse
It wasn't his fault she left you
Yeah? Yeah
Bullshit!
Hollywood, this is seven-one
Dillnick is making a Redi-Whip delivery to the parking lot at the Bowl
Can somebody take her off his hands?
Thanks
Tell them to take their time
Phil, can you get the champagne?
Have a staff member find his body in the morning
Police can notify his wife
Washington wants full damage control
Understand?
Sure you can handle these girls?
It's my business
It's your business if you don't
Graham
This is out of our league, Jack
It's also out of our jurisdiction
Come on, we're in Beverly Hills
Nice suit
It's OK, it's OK
He's just picking up her and her girlfriend
He's their lawyer
They don't look safe to drive
Get lost, pal
Getting strange
Be cool, now
What? I didn't say anything
Stone! Somebody's calling you
Stone!
What?! What, what, what?
Zara, come on!
What the hell are you doing?
You out of your mind?
Move over! I'm gonna drive
You said you were gonna...
You said you were gonna quit
I want a promotion, Moon, not a goddamn suspension
He's running, Harry
Well, you shot at him!
He's dirty I know he's dirty!
I'm finally gonna nail his black ass to the wall
If you have any drugs in your purse... would you please just throw them out the window?
I don't believe...
You know, I could be disbarred for this shit
Leon!
Give me the purse...
Hold the girls and get some backup
Oh, Moon
Ah, Jesus
Stay put
Stone!
Move
Fuck
Well, it's about time
Now, look, I'm a lawyer, all right?
And this is a clear-cut case of harassment
Now, for the past six months this poor excuse for a police off...
Are you gentlemen gonna keep this mad dog off me, or what?
Thank you
All right, look...
I don't know what the problem you have with...
Jesus, what the hell have you been eating?
Your ass, nigger
You called him the '"n'" word?
You left Dillnick with a car date at the Hollywood Bowl... fired your weapon without cause at a private club... participated in a high-speed car chase... then you decked a black lawyer in front of a hundred people... and called him the '"n'" word?
I made the arrest
You made squat, Moony... and I am sick and tired of your street cowboy attitude... and your racist bullshit
But let me try and get through to you,
Moony
There are those of us who can say the '"n'" word... and there are those of us who cannot
Now, I can say the '"n'" word
Nigger, nigger, nigger, nigger, nigger
See, I can say the damn word all I want... but your can't
In fact, Moony, if I catch your little perverse, bigoted... bullshit mouth saying it again...
I'm going to personally tear you out a new asshole
Is this going to affect my... promotion evaluation?
Promotion?
You are suspended, Sergeant
Leave your piece and your shield with Rinselle on the way out of here
Called him the '"n'" word and want a promotion
Sorry, Moon
Did you do it?
Moon?
You doing OK?
You don't look so good
Thank you
What was this all about tonight?
Is he pimping for you now?
I don't deserve that, Moon
Neither does he
What were you doing?
I didn't tell you I finished night school finally... and I got my application into
Valley Arts College... and I saved up all the tuition...
What?
I don't know why I keep forgetting to drop this off
Every time I'm near your house, it's not the right time
Jesus Christ!
Why do you have to keep doing that?
I need it For what?
Self-defense
From what?
Why do you carry a gun?
I'm a cop!
Yeah, well, I'm not
Do you still have the fishbowl?
Yeah
Can you just put this in there with the others?
And, like, if something happens to me... have them print it up
You know, like, sprinkle them over Hollywood Boulevard like ashes
Coming? Yeah
Crys
Bye, Moon
Because I love you so
Come here, here you go
Come on now
That's yours, yeah, that's yours
OK, you can have some of that, too, all right?
Hey, come here
Look at that
Come out of here
There you go
You want some of this?
Just a bit
There you go
Yeah, I know, glad to see you, too
Get out of here, will you?
I'm trying to give you stuff you like
Get out, what's the matter with you?
That's it, Chuck, you don't get any more
Well, maybe just a... just a little more
Chuck!
What are you saying?
That's it? He's dead?
He will be without a new heart... and the odds of finding a
B-positive donor...
Dr. Posner
Excuse me
He was a cop?
Yeah, vice
How the hell did he get in that kind of condition?
Vice
Sad news for the State of California and the nation
Senator James Marquand... one of the most respected leaders on Capitol Hill... is dead at fifty four
Found by a staff member in his
Bel Air home this morning... the author of the new anti-drug legislation... is believed to have died from heart failure
The President described Marquand as a true gentleman... a brilliant statesman...
OK, which one of you guys said the Hail Mary?
The donor's condition?
It was a car accident... severe trauma to the head and lower back... severed brainstem
Otherwise, the guy's a cream puff
His form's in order?
We got him on file
He had it marked on his license
Anything medical?
This guy's squeaky clean about everything but his occupation
Pusher? Close
Proctologist? Getting warmer
Don't tell me he's a lawyer
But don't sweat malpractice
He's too dead to sue
Shit, turn that down
I got it
OK, he's asleep, come on, come on
You sure he knows?
It's only been a few weeks
Yeah, the doctor told him yesterday
Everything, right?
Yeah, everything, now will you come on?
You got it on him?
It won't stand up
Well, them, prop it up
You sure he knows, Harry?
He knows, he knows
Harry?
One, two, three, four...
Can't get enough of you, babe...
Can't get enough of you...
Ooh, darling...
Can't get enough of you...
Can't get enough of you, babe...
Can't get enough of you...
All I want is you, babe...
Don't you know it's true?
What the fuck is this?
Oh, shit
He doesn't know
Moony, stop! Come back here! Mo...
Posner said he was gonna tell you,
Moon
We didn't know
Jack, what do you think you're doing out of bed?
You put it in
Now you take it out!
Want to tell me where he had it?
I want you to exercise, Jack... or you can throw these ten months of rehab... out the window, understand?
No drinking, no smoking, no fatty foods
No more roundups, no more drug busts... no more asinine car chases
You're a desk sergeant now, a career paper jock
You got it?
Yeah, I got it
I didn't want to take you back, Moony
Central made me
Just because we got the same color heart... don't go thinking we're blood
Hey, Moony, starting to walk with a little rhythm
Funny
Hey, Moondog...
Nice tan, Moony
They say the heart's not the only new equipment you got
You wish
Terri... did you ever locate Crystal Gerrity?
She's the carrot top Detective Zara was checking out
Detective Zara?
Yeah, Harry, she's a hooker, right?
Yeah
He said she'd picked up a couple of speeding tickets out near Malibu
Right, about six months ago
The addresses she gave on both citations were phony
Zip on the Peisha chick, too
They're out there, but nobody knows where
Could you run it through the machine for me again?
Well, anything's possible for a little of your honey
You got a dirty mind
See you
Now, that was all Harry's idea, Jack
If he's gonna ride with you, you got to get him to get rid of those stripes
Ever since that night at the Bowl he thinks that that's his lucky jacket
Shit
Well, we got to go
Yeah, go
Later
Yeah, Harry
Let me see your shield
Come on
Looks nice
Looks real good on you
Thanks
Keep the change
Thanks
Don't eat that
Clogs the arteries
It makes your breath stink
Listen, ass...
Trust me
Now, look, look
I wasn't even gonna say anything, you know
I tried to give you a chance to get into the groove... and as bad as those Camels are...
I was more than willing to let a few of those go by... but when you start shoving this dog meat into your face...
I'm sorry, I just have to step in
I have to do something, now put it down
Put it down
Moony, put it down
Put it down
Didn't you listen to the doctor?
Don't you know what this shit does to your heart?
Moony, look, you're looking very stupid now
You are dancing with a cheeseburger
We can do this all day, OK?
But you look real silly... dancing around with a cheeseburger
The only person that can see me is you
What's up with that guy?
You know, you can't get away from me
This is a very good-looking car
I mean, this is absolutely fabulous
Has it ever been washed?
It's weird, I know, it's very weird
I'm not even used to it myself
It's kind of like that out-of-body... you know, astral-projection,
Shirley Maclaine thing
I mean, one minute...
I'm sitting in the front seat of my car, and I'm dying
Next time I know... boom!
I'm standing in the operating room looking at myself... while they're pulling my heart out of me
I mean, it was like that...
What's the name of that movie?
Oh, this is very good, this is good
Going back and forth is good because it stimulates the heart
It makes you a lot strong...
Are you listening to me?
You are listening to me?
Hey, wait a minute
You're ignoring me, aren't you?
Now, listen, I didn't want my heart in you... any more than you wanted my heart in you... and if I knew that my heart was gonna be... inside a piece of racist scum like you...
I never would've donated it in the first place
But that's OK, you know, because life's a bitch... and then you die, you know?
It's true, isn't it?
Hey... but I didn't die! I was murdered!
I didn't get a real good look... if it was a Cutlass Sierra or a... but I did get a real good look at the driver... right before he ran me off the road
Hey, Moony, you OK?
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine
Aren't you gonna... Wait a minute!
Aren't you gonna talk to me?
I thought you said you wanted to be a detective, huh?
I thought you said you wanted that gold shield?
Well, this is your opportunity, this is it
Now are you gonna talk to me, or aren't you?
No!
I'm gonna prescribe a little medication,
Jack
Nothing serious
Just something to calm your nerves... help the hallucinations
I take these every once in a while... hoping my wife will disappear
But you mean that this is a normal thing?
Oh, sure it is
This could be perfectly normal
A psycho-chemical aberration of some kind
We're just beginning to learn... how transplants affect the human body and mind
Take a couple of days off
You'll feel much better
Is that tranquilizer working yet?
Say yes, you want to wind up in a mental institution?
Jack? Yes!
Yeah, it's working fine
It's OK
Jesus! Chuck!
Personally, I think that this racism this refusal to acknowledge me... stems from feelings of inadequacy
I mean, you look at me
What do you see?
Someone college-educated, damn good-looking... hung like a Shetland pony, and you feel threatened
Am I hitting a nerve?
Come on, Chuck
Oh, I see, you can talk to the cat, but you can't talk to me
Get out of the way, Shithead
Ohh! You can talk to me, thank you
Racial prejudice I can understand... but ghost prejudice?
An entirely new concept
As a matter of fact...
I think you're breaking new ground in this area
Hey! Close the door
I can't, the only thing I can move is you
Shit
It's hard to believe Crys could live in a pigpen like this
How long was it for, huh?
A month or two?
Four
Four?
And she wasn't hooking when she was living with me
Yeah, probably too busy cleaning, huh?
You won't go away, will you?
Well, best as I can figure,
I go where you go
As long as that heart's beating we're attached
Which is why you won't be eating that bacon, that chili, that...
Polish sausage?
Look, go to hell!
That's what I'm trying to avoid
Now, look, Moony, you don't have to like me... but you are gonna have to live with me now, whatever problem you had with me because of Crys... leave it behind you because you're gonna need me... if you want to help me find...
Find her?
Yeah
What do you know?
Only what happened the night
I was killed
She have something to do with that?
Yeah, now, she and the other girl
Peisha... they both work for this big-time gangster... called himself John Graham
He dealt strictly to the upper classes
You know, drugs, girls...
Yeah, yeah, I know, Pimp to the stars
Sounds like your kind of client
Say, say, don't go there, all right?
I represent the girls, not their employers
Anyway, Crys called me from the country club... said she was having a little legal trouble... and asked me to pick her up
You give all your clients that kind of service?
Well, she was upset
Is that why you hit her?
I was upset
Oh, you were both upset
Yeah, we were both upset!
All right, Moony?
Why don't you wash your dishes here... for crying out loud?
Why did you run from me?
What?
Come on, you're dead now
Well, Peisha was holding some crack that she got...
I knew it! You knew what?
You lucky son of bitch!
If I'd have caught you...
You couldn't have caught my mother,
Moony
I probably got my heart attack from you.
Well, had I known, I would've surren...
Can ghosts get colds?
I'm allergic to cats
But you're dead
It's psychological
What's so funny?
A hypochondriac spook
What the fuck was all that about?
Now we're even
This guy who allegedly ran you off the road...
Are you here or not here?
Yeah, I'm here
What was his name?
Teller, he was the muscle you saw with the girls at the club
If he ran you off the road, they think you know something
The legal problem Crys called you about... maybe it was drugs
I don't think so
It was something more, something bigger
I tried to find out from the girls but they wouldn't talk
At least not that night
I didn't make it to the next morning, so...
Yeah, it's just on the left here
Turn at the next corner
This is Century Luxury Villas
These things start at almost a mil, huh?
Yeah, so?
Fix your collar and try not to act like a cop
Shit
How much were you pulling down a year?
The mortgage on a place like this has gotta be, what, six grand a month?
That's my lizard pot
He's got my lizard pot
Twelve times six, seventy-two?
Hey, you got my lizard pot!
With tax, you're looking at eighty-five grand a year!
Hey, you got a pool!
He's got my lizard pot
He's got my cactus
Hey, that's my... where you going with...
This is a lot of money
This is a lot of money
Where are you going with my cactus?
An awful lot of money
What's going on here?
Well, it's open house
'"All furniture, household effects...
'"and objet d'art may be purchased'"
Oh, mama, no
No, I left you the house
I didn't tell you you could sell it
Well, what else is the old lady gonna do with it?
Fuck you, too
It's sterling
Actually, I was more interested in the picture
You can take all the pictures if you like
In fact, I'll pay you to get rid of this harem
My mother's a church-going woman, so watch what you say
Hello, Mommy
When I think of all the in-and-out that went on in here
Not one grandchild to show for it
Well, I was planning on settling down
He always said he was planning on settling down
Does this hump pen look like he was settling down to you?
Hump pen? This place has style
His idea of style was my idea of obscenity
I want to unload everything to do with it
Yeah, but not at K-Mart prices
Do you know this woman?
Do I know you?
I'm a cop You look it
I told you to fix your collar
I'm trying to locate this girl...
Crys Gerrity
I was wondering, can I look through your son's Rolodex?
You can have my son's Rolodex
What?
But don't ask me about his women
Have you seen her since your son's accident?
A cop got his heart, you know?
He knows I know
His name is Moony
I know, yeah, so's mine
She cried almost as much as I did at the funeral
Such a pretty girl
Held my hand most of the day
The last time I saw her was when she came by here... to pick up a few things
It was near Thanksgiving time, I think
Do you know where she was going?
She didn't say, she just drove off... with that slick man in his red Ferrari
Yes, this is John Graham
Any messages?
Jackson who?
Moony
What's that? Is that a scratch there?
Can you buff that out, please?
And use the toothbrush on the wheels
If you want to get to Graham, you gotta trust me
Listen, asshole, already I've been insulted... by the car park guy, the guy at the door
We're not leaving, Moony
Now, this may be fun to you, but I'm damned if I'm gonna... pop for another three-dollar tea bag
Will you keep it down, please?
No, if I don't hit the can soon...
Moony, the man is smart
That's why he has an answering service stead of a direct line
Now, would you rather him call you back at the police station... or a place that makes him feel more comfortable... like the Beverly Palm Hotel?
Call for you, Mr. Moony
All right, remember
Howard Steadman is your best friend
Tip him a deuce
Two dollars
Tip him a deuce for the phone
Thank God nobody can see me
Jackson Moony
Jackson Moony, John Graham
Sorry to pull you away from the pool on such a delicious day... but I got your message on my service... and I don't believe we've ever met
I'm from New York, actually
I'm here on business
Howard Steadman said that you had a redhead named Crystal... that you might be able to put me in touch with
It's a impossibility
Can you fix me up tomorrow night?
Well, as you probably know,
Howard's in Yugoslavia... working on his picture, so it's impossible for me... to cross-check your reference
Would it help if I mentioned... his night of leather in Palm Springs?
Crys said they were into gymnastics
You must be very good friends
You're working tomorrow night
That's all we could find on him
No address, no priors
Name's probably phony
OK, thanks
This Graham's gonna be hard to find
Which is why you gotta keep your date with her
You're dreaming!
The guy deals with high rollers
I can't afford lunch
Where am I gonna get that kind of money?
Or class?
What the fuck's that supposed to mean?
You think I got no class, huh?
You think wearing an Italian suit gives you class?
It gives you nothing, nothing
He see his doctor?
Yesterday
He said Posner gave him some new medication
Doesn't seem to be working
Why don't you get off my back?
Just get off my back!
Go on, get the fuck off!
Better keep an eye on him
Christ! What is it with you? Jesus!
Let me know what he's up to
Shit
A bowling alley?
I didn't know you people did this
Yeah, and we swim, too
Now, look, just relax, all right?
We're just here to pick up a little pocket change
You're with the owner
The what?
The owner, you think I got rich defending hookers?
You know what the cash return is on a pair of bowling shoes?
We're on our way back to the pin setters
Just... loosen up
Two drink minimum if you don't bowl
Yeah, that's right
There's a two drink minimum
There's nothing wrong with making a little profit
Now say hello to Bubba
Ask him how his mother is
Order a couple of beers
Hello, Bubba, how's your mother?
She died last summer
Well, I'm a little behind
I'll take a couple of beers
Which way to the pin setters?
Stone!
Every one of these mothers is a Black Panther hungry for white meat
I'm gonna wind up dish of the day
What are we doing here?
See that hole over there?
The one that looks like a duck?
Yeah
You feel a pipe in there? Yeah
All right, pull it out
Yeah, that's it
Jesus!
My emergency cash reserve
How much is in here?
Two hundred thousand dollars
And I'm the only guy who was ever able to take it with him
Don't want your beers?
Have a beer
Yeah, maybe just one Yeah, one beer
Can I help you?
Hey, it's my brother Archimedes
You find what you were looking for back there?
Nice guy, I left him the bar
A few balls, a couple of pins
Here it is
How do they know about my stash?
And maybe a hundred and fifty grand?
How did you know... 150?
I left $200,000...
It's supposed to be two hundred thousand
Oh, I see, you steal from your own brother
You own... you flesh...
You know, Ma said you was...
You know, if I wasn't dead, I'll...
Hit him one time for me, Moony, would you, please?
Did you know that this is extortion money?
That your brother was about to be brought up... on Federal charges when he died?
Yeah, slap him one time for me
Now, I can walk out of here with this evidence...
Or I can walk out of here with this evidence and you
It's your choice, Archimedes
Right
Hold it, hold it, hold it, wait
What?
Oh, shit!
Jesus!
Get him out of there!
That was the most stupid...
I'm sorry, just start... let's go!
Go, go, go!
You want to tell me what the hell that was all about?
So I was talking to a friend of mine the other day... and I hate to drop names... you know that, but I said, '"Bobby... '"
Well, that's Bobby DeNiro, but that's beside the point
'"Bobby, the thing is this... '"
Listen, what time is it?
It's time for you to get your big, fat, extra-crispy-bucket-o'-chicken... two-liter-pepsi-cola-drinking ass out of bed
That's what time it I, allez, allez!
We must exercise!
Come on, Jack, let's go!
And one, two, three, four!
Come on, Jack,
Your public is waiting
Public, my ass
Well, it'll be your ass if you don't hurry up and get up
We have to go downtown, we have to exercise... we have to get into some suits
Get your black ass out of here, will you?
Black man!
'"Get your black ass out of here'"
I like that, get down, brother!
Give me five! All right!
There's five
Fuck off!
Shit! I never knew... there were so many hills in Hollywood
Fuck off!
Come on, come on, look at me!
I'm running circles around you
And you're supposed to be a cop, huh?
Is this L.A.'s finest, huh?
I'm a cop! Yeah, yeah!
Oh, well!
Get the fuck out of here! Shit!
He bought an $80,000 Mercedes-Benz with cash?
It's not the Jack Moony I know
I don't know what the hell he's doing
Whatever he's doing, it's got to be illegal
Well, we better get ready
They're dropping Crys off at eight
Did she really like this stuff?
She never seemed to mind 'em on me
Oh, come on, Moony, look
We fooled around, all right?
She took some pictures
That was the end of it
It wasn't serious
I was a single guy, you heard my mother
Last thing I needed or wanted was to be tied down
Hey, look, what you gotta face is the fact that she left the old Jack Moony
See, this is not the same girl who was on the street corner... dating cops and eating cheeseburgers
She's a different woman now
Same job
Yeah, but didn't she ever tell you about going to art school?
It was a pipe dream, you saw her stuff
Oh, and we're art critics now, huh?
You know, you see a kid fishing in a mud puddle
Is that any reason to take away his pole?
People have dreams, Moony
They have ambitions
And when she tells you about her dreams... you gotta respect them, you gotta listen
I always listened
Yeah?
I listened
All right, all right
What's the name of her dog back home?
Henry
How many sisters does she have?
Two... Lisa and Joanie
What's her favorite movie?
'"Rambo'"
'"Rambo'"?
'"Pinocchio'"
And I knew all of that in the first half-hour
You see? That's why she left Ohio,
Moony
Nobody listened
Nobody took her seriously... and you're wondering why she left you
I kept her off the streets
Yes, by wrapping her up so tight, she couldn't move
You see, you want to keep everybody in little boxes
You want to keep me in the ghetto
You want to keep Crys back at home
Even that knucklehead Wendt
And you tell me that you don't resent him being your superior officer
Yeah, you can't, can you?
You see, we're all like the film in the goldfish bowl at your home
You want to keep us all right there... where you can see us, don't you?
You don't want to let it out to be developed
You know how much that stuff costs to process?
Hey, it costs to go to art school
It costs to be a lawyer
It costs to be a fucking detective
Some of us are willing to pay the price, Moony
Hey, there's nothing to be scared of, Moony
Nobody's out to get you
You don't have to be scared that we're all gonna leave you behind
Would you like something from the bar?
Yeah, ask her first
What do you think?
A glass of wine
Wine list, a couple of Evians
The wine list and two Evians
The wine list
I didn't know you knew what Evian was
Bottled water
I'm learning
What are you doing?
Is this some kind of a setup?
What do you mean?
Are you gonna bust me?
For what?
Bein' beautiful?
Touche
Did you process any of my film?
Why?
I wondered
It's still in the goldfish bowl
Good
Nice suit
Yeah
Did you polish your fingernails?
Did I tell you I knew what a woman likes?
You can't afford that on a cop's salary
Oh, I, uh...
I came into some money
How?
Oh, shit, how?
Don't tell me it's an inheritance
No, she's too smart for that
Malpractice
Malpractice
Your heart surgery
Yeah, they stitched me up with a sponge inside
Good
Judges like that one
So then you quit the force and started buying Italian suits?
Right, yeah
I don't believe that
Yeah, neither do I
OK, maybe you better go and call Teller
That's dangerous
I don't want to
Lucky
How's Chuck?
He's fat
I would like to tempt you... with the chef's specials before you decide
For appetizer, we have a shitake and mushroom... on the salmon dim sum dumpling in a red currant sauce
Salmon dumplings in currant sauce
Are you still puttin' bourbon in his milk?
No
We're both reformed men
That's too bad
There is also a special poached scallop with taro... over a bed of squid ink fettuccine with a ginger root sauce
Do you remember your tablecloth?
Yeah
Well, I... I had it... I had it cleaned and mended
You didn't have to do that
No, you... you remember the armenian lady next door?
Mrs. Arkmanian
Yeah! Yeah
Well, she saw the, um, you know...
Embroidery?
Yeah, well, she said that was really good.
Then a duck feet, dim-sum style this, over a bed of arugula with a spicy rice vinegar...
Is he serious? He's serious
And finally we have the... egg roll with a... s-s-shredd-ed-ed squid...
'"Squeed'"
Shred-ed-ed squid!
Eggplant... fresh stalk fennel, salmon, ground oysters...
Excuse me
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Back off! Back off?
Look, I did not make this kind of investment... to see you blowing it with that girl!
I am not blowin' it!
Listen, I thank you for helpin' me find Crys...
I thank you for the car, for the hotel... for the clothes!
I even thank you for the goddamn nail polish!
This is my date... and my night... and I want you to back the hell off!
Oh, I see, I see
So, I can set up the date, I can buy you the clothes... but she starts making eyes at you... and you don't need me anymore, is that it?
No! I don't need you anymore
Well, did it occur to you that she's a pro?
Has it occurred to you that you're... that I'm paying for this?
Yes!
Yes, it did
But maybe I wanna pretend, huh?
Maybe it's easier for me to pretend... if her ex... whatever you were... is not hangin' over her shoulder... tellin' me to order squid dum-dum!
Dim sum
Dim sum Dim sum
And you're gonna ask her about what happened that night
Yeah! Yeah, OK, I'm gonna ask her!
Where's the waiter?
I think he has a few other tables
Yeah
Hey, why don't...
What?
What were you gonna say?
Where... of all the places in this city...
Where do you want to eat?
I don't get it
I always had to drag you down here
Hey, allow for a little growth
A little growth
I mean, you can only eat so much...
S-s-shredd-ed-ed squid!
Before eight-ball and tube steak looks pretty good.
So... how we doing?
We're down six points
Moon! What?
Hey! What?
Oh, you wanna play, huh?
Come on
You wanna play
So what do you wanna do?
I'll show you what I can do!
Stop it!
I didn't!
Yes, you did
Is it OK if I take this stuff off?
Sure
Whatever you want
Sometimes...
I just get so tired... of doing everything the hard way
Yeah
Yeah
Oh, God, I missed you
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Does it hurt?
Not much anymore
They say that the blood an tissue types... have to be an exact match
You and Leon
Blood brothers
Get out of here
Oh, Moon
He was a good guy
You would've liked him
You reminded me of him tonight
Maybe it's his heart
Oh, fuck
What's up?
I gotta go
You know...
I like... I liked your pictures
And all those things you were tellin' me?
I was listening
Like, I... I know you had a dog named Henry... and a couple of sisters
Lisa and, uh...
Joanie
Yeah
And your favorite movie is Pinocchio
Pinocchio?
Oh, please! Pinocchio?!
What am I always talkin' about?
The Parent Trap!
Moon!
So, you're using my material, too, huh?
Yeah, Pinocchio
So I lied, sue me
Put out that cigarette
It's her You smoked it
What else did you see?
Enough to know that you didn't ask her about what happened that night
I'm workin' up to it
That's bullshit, Moony
Look, she needs time
This is delicate!
I kept my part of the bargain
You asked me to back off, I backed off
I kept my part of the bargain
Now you keep yours
You're pissed because we're hittin' it off
Yes
No
Yes... no, I'm pissed because the guy who killed me isn't behind bars
You wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for me, Moony you wouldn't even be here, not with Crys... not at the Beverly Palm Hotel, not on this earth
So when she comes back in this room
I want you to ask her what happened!
Were you talkin' to someone?
Room service
Oh, room service
Don't order for me, I have to go
Ask her
Can't you stay for breakfast?
It's not me, it's Graham
Ask her
Call you at home
Yeah
Uh, Crys...
What? That... the night, uh...
Stone died... the night I chased you, remember?
Hard to forget
Mmm, yeah
Did anything happen before he picked you up that... might have caused his murder?
Oh, shit!
No, Crys... I knew it!
Crys, please...
Crys, listen to me! Crys!
Crys, please!
Crys, it's not like that! Listen! Crys!
Come on, Moony!
Hurry up! She's getting away
So are my pants!
Harry
Harry, I think something's going on down here!
Crys! Come on!
I shouldn't have asked her!
We should've waited!
For what? So you two could have another go in bed?
You stayed in the living room
Of course, you think I can learn anything... watching a white boy? Huh?
Well, according to Crys you can!
Oh, all right, Superman
Well, give it your best shot, then
That's it, you got it, you got it
Mercedes keys
They're all Mercedes keys!
Yeah, that one
Hey, Moon?
Harry?
What are you...
I found it
Bullshit
I inherited it
A bunch of crap
I was given it by a dead ni... lawyer... to find out who killed him
Very good
I didn't know you had it in you
Now, you see how easy that was?
Today is my golf day... and my foursome teed off about twenty minutes ago
Maybe if I hurry, I can catch them on the back nine
Hold him
He can't hold you
You can't hold me
Hmm, the hell I can't
Not without bail Not without bail
I got you, Moony
Maybe not this minute... but I got you
Who got you that hat?
I want you in here at eight tomorrow for a full psychiatric examination... and until that time, you are suspended!
Yeah, that's what you need, suspenders
And you leave your badge...
Leave my badge and my piece with Rinselle on the way out
Fore!
Fuck it!
Why the hell did I listen to you?
We gotta find Crys
We found her! You made me blow it!
Hey, I'm doin' this for you
For me? For you
For me? For you
You've just got me thrown off the force!
I'm on my way to a mental institution!
Well, nobody's perfect
Shit! Jack?
You... you OK?
Look, I just wanted you to know... that I was following you 'cause
I was concerned... not because of Wendt
Sure, Harry
I mean, you need help, partner
You really do
Yeah
Go home and get some sleep, OK?
Yeah
Get the fuck away from me!
Get away!
What?
Chuck, get out of there
Come on, Moony, you can't order an autopsy report... when you're on suspension
Well, do it in Harry's name
I'll clear it with him
The man was a U.S. Senator
What do I say we're looking for?
Cocaine
You know what kind of scandal this could be?
It's a cover-up thing, like the Redford movie
We're not gonna find anything in that autopsy report
Right, right, what's that got to do with finding Crys out here?
She had black spots on the bottom of her feet
Black spot... yeah?
It was beach tar
You know? Beach tar
There's not a lot of beaches up here that have enough to stick
Yeah? Right
Now, in police work, that... coupled with a Malibu speeding ticket... and you've got...
You got what?
Oh, get the fuck out of here
This is too easy
Now, wait a minute, Jack, remember...
I know what to say
Crys!
Shit!
Get out of my life, Moony
I'm not gonna do that
No, you don't understand
You have to leave, OK?
I'm not gonna do that, either
Moony, turn around and walk away
Crys, I developed the film
Why? Why did you do that?
You gave them to me
No, I gave it to you... because I knew you wouldn't develop it
You'd just throw it in the fishbowl
Until something happened to you!
Nothing's happened to me
Yes, it did! You met me!
Listen, Marquand died of a drug overdose, right?
Yes
Graham killed Stone on the chance... that you might have told him about it
Yes
Do they know about the pictures?
That's the only reason we're still alive
Has anyone seen them?
No, not yet, but I'm gonna take 'em down
Moon!
I know what you wanna do
You can't do it
What the fuck are you talkin' about?
Leave
And don't do anything... please
Hey, listen to me!
Please, Moon!
Crys!
Go away!
They'll see you!
Listen!
I can help you get out of this!
No! We have a deal
You got a trap!
He can see us
There's nothing you can do about it
Moon... nothing's the same
You see that?
Everything's gone
No! It's not gone
They'll kill me
No! I'm an accessory
I'll go to jail
Well, testify for immunity!
They'll find me
Look, I can protect you!
I don't care what happens to me
Well, who the fuck do you care for?!
This is my baby
He already lost his father
You want him to lose me, too?
Stone?
My God
I was pregnant couple of months before he died
I never told him
Baby...
I didn't want it to look like I was trying... to force him into something
I want this baby
Hey, baby
Jesus
You wanted to marry him
Does that make a difference?
Oh, Jesus, he's so beautiful!
Thank you, baby
Hey... come...
Hey, hey, Moon, come on, hol...
Come on and hold him for me
Tell... you know, tell me how he feels
Come on, Moon
Tell me how he feels, huh?
Moon?
Hey, Moon, come on, tell me...
Hey, Moon, don't do this to me.
Come on, tell me how he's...
Moony, come on! Tell me how he feels!
Hey!
Moony!
Peisha
Ready to go get some Pampers?
Yeah, oK
Crys?
Sorry
That's OK, that's OK
Here, let me hold him
No... Come on
Oh, yeah
You're a big boy
I just got off the phone... with Senator Marquand's people
They're very upset with me
Seems that someone from the police department... has pulled out the Senator's autopsy file
And that wouldn't happen to be a Mr. Moony?
The jerk from last night?
Did you know he was a cop? Huh?
Did you? Did you know he was a cop?
Did you know your mommy was one of his old roomies?
Did you? Did you know that?
At least that's what Peisha tells me
I just got some very good Mexican brown
I hope she didn't O.D.
You lied to me
What?
Hey, look, look, you never should've left
That's the bottom line, all right?
She wanted me to leave... or weren't you listening?
The girl needs our help
Well, she don't need mine
The girl's in love with you, asshole!
Fuck off!
Yeah, well, fuck you!
She's in love with you!
What the hell has that got to do with anything?
I'm dead now!
Like hell you are!
Shit!
What is this shit?!
Fucking gotta be some kind of curse!
Me and Rambis, man, fuck!
Ha! You work your ass off, for what?
Fuckin' what?!
I'm not good enough for Crys!
Even my own heart ain't good enough!
Shit!
Fuckin' white curse!
No, it's not! It's a black fuckin' conspiracy!
A what?
You! You heard me!
You fuckin' people, you... you creep up around and just suck up to us!
You make us trust you... and then you... all the time, you're robbin' us blind!
Oh, we do that, huh?
You! You, you fuckin'...
Say it, Moony, say it!
Say it! Niggers, right? Coon, chinks!
Spics! Kike!
Mook!
Niggers! Niggers!
Niggers!
Moon?
Moon?
All right, just take... take it easy, take it easy
Moony, that you?
I know we've had problems, but...
I don't think rejecting my heart is the answer
You agree?
Yeah, I mean, there's other ways... we can vent our frustration
We could... we could go to the amusement park, uh... ride the bumper cars
Play Mike Tyson's video Nintendo
You could be Mike Tyson
I'll... l'll be the white guy
No, I wanna be Mike Tyson
Anyway, we can... ice hockey... uh, full-contact karate
I mean, we're mature men, aren't we?
I think we should just... just chalk this rejection episode... up to a learning experience... as something that will never happen again
You do agree?
Oh, good
That makes me breathe a lot easier
Now we gotta do something about Crys
If Graham's suspicious, no telling what could happen
Yeah, we better...
We gotta...
We gotta get her
Any ideas? Yeah
Wait a minute, let's not jump to conclusions
That thing could be keeping us alive
My ass
Where's the fuckin' phone?
Who you gonna call?
Arnold Palmer
What?
Are you trying to screw up my entire day?
I am rid of you, Moony
The shrink is gonna pull you... and you are going to be out of my life for good!
Not crazy?
Anyone who would think that a U.S. Senator would o.d. On crack... has got to be out of his damn mind
No, I don't believe it, either... and besides, if you just had an attack... you shouldn't even be on the telephone
Moon...
Moon, would you calm... just calm down, all ri...
Iook, I will be there
I'm not supposed to take this out of the building
Yeah, I... I remember the night at the Bowl
Moon, don't... don't tell my mother
Listen, hold on
OK, I'll do it, yeah
OK
Oh, and... and, Moon, um...
Someone the name of Crystal called... and Terri said that she should call you at home, OK?
Moon?
It's Crys
Peisha and I are in serious trouble... you understand?
And I need to see you, please
Oh, Jesus
What is it? What did she say?
They know, they're gonna kill her
We're gonna take little Leo to... you know the World House?
It's up past the old swim club...
That used to be Needle Park for the surf set
We'll wait for you there until eight
And after that, I... I don't know what's gonna happen
Tell him about the pictures
You have to bring the pictures... and come alone, Moon
Please, come
I love you
We got forty minutes
Jesus, they got my kid
Call the police
I'd waste forty minutes trying to make 'em believe me
I'll leave Harry a note
Two three nine, code blue, code blue
Two three nine
Grab ten ccs ccs!
I think they responded very well to that
Here
Hemorrhoids
Crude, but funny
Over there
A police car's a little obvious, isn't it?
We got thirty minutes
You wanna take a bus?
You sure you're gonna be OK?
If I'm not, you're gonna be the first to know
The note says he's on his way to Malibu
Excuse me, I'm looking for Jack Moony
Who the hell isn't?
Yes, it's written to a guy named Harry
I'm Harry
You friend's lucky to be walking
How the deuce do you think he's gonna get to the beach?
This is a little bit more excitement than is called for in this situation... don't you think?
He took the car because he needed it
You think he's gonna ask for it?
Look, I don't think you realize just how serious his condition is
I realize it, I realize it
Harry! Harry...
Dillnick, what are you doing here?
Uh, Moon told me to bring
Marquand's autopsy file
Now, I know it's not supposed to leave the precinct...
Son of a bitch!
What's going on here?
Holy shit
What?
They never even checked for drugs
Yeah
No, I'm certain I can arrange something for you on Friday
Time check
Quarter to eight
You OK?
Yeah
Uh, I'm a little fuzzy
Did she ever read to you?
Yeah
Every Sunday morning
The funnies, you know?
Yeah? Yeah
Yeah, me, too
She'd start me out with Doonesbury
Peanuts
Yeah, figures
You should have married her, Moony
Yeah
We both should have
I don't give a damn what Wendt says
Meet me there with a chopper
You think he might suspend us, Harry?
Being a cop is like being a pitcher,
Dillnick
You want your strikes, you gotta risk your balls
It really irritates me when people don't check their answering machines
Well, shoot 'em up
Hold on
Take it easy, take it easy
This'll make you feel a lot better
Come on, we're out of here
Just give her half
Oh, God
You realize this is a setup, don't you?
Yeah
I realize this is a setup
Well, a good lawyer always makes sure his clients are prepared
Yeah
I'm prepared
You OK?
You be the scout I'll be the scout
Hey, Stone
Thanks
Ah, there's nobody here
Shit
Moon?
Sunglasses and an uzi
Watch my back
You OK?
Yeah
Aw, Jesus
This is it
Teller's got Crys and... my son
The right side
Graham's on the left
I'll check the side rooms
Moon, I'm sorry
Hi
The side rooms are empty
I'll watch the door
Ain't love grand?
Cut the shit, I'm here
Now let the girls go
I'll forget about Marquand and deliver the pictures
Moon, there's one coming up behind you
He's got a big gun
That's the plan I had with the girls
Moon?
I don't like to make the same mistake twice
Moon!
Moon!
You're dead, I guarantee it
You're dead, you're dead!
Moon... Moon...
Crys... come on
Crys, come on
You gotta stand up
Come on, pick up the baby!
You gotta stand, pick up the baby
Come on, honey
Moon, Peisha...
Don't worry about Peisha
She's dead
Let me worry about Peisha, come on
You just worry about little Lee
Come on, honey, come on
Fight it, don't give in to it
Come on!
Honey...
Let's get out of here!
OK Lean on me
It's OK
It's OK
It's OK, Lee
Yeah, it's OK, we're going
Yeah, you... you just keep going, honey
Get back! Back!
Now!
Come on, come on, come on
Keep with him, get behind me
Don't look, honey, don't look, come on
Come on, let's get out of here
Get back, get back, another guy
Come on
Let's get out of here, come on
Go this way! This way, Moon!
OK... honey, you gotta get up
You gotta get up!
No, I...
Moon!
Get up!
Come on, get up
Come on, it's only a ten-foot drop
No You gotta jump
Come on, you gotta jump
No Give me the baby
Jump
Come on, over you go
That's it
OK, honey, it's OK, it's OK, come on
Just let yourself down
That's it, that's it!
Don't drop the baby, Moon
I'm not gonna drop the baby
Don't drop the baby
Here's little Lee, here you go, fella
Down you go
All right, he can get down
Take him, take him
Honey, honey!
Tell her to go now
Tell her to go down to the beach
Go down to the beach, honey
Get out of here, go on
Where'd you go?
Hey, Harry, detective Moony's holding his arm
A little funny, isn't he?
Yeah, it must have something to do with his heart condition
